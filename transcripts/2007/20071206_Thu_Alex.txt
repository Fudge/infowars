[00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:10.017]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.658 --> 00:00:11.478]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:13.119]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.743]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:22.106]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:26.489]  In the 12-plus years I've been on radio,
[00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:51.930]  And even looking back at mass shootings before that, there has never been a mass shooting of the suicide shooter type, where they always kill a bunch of people and then expose themselves, dispose of themselves by blowing their own heads off.
[00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:02.516]  Sometimes you have mass shootings where it's gangland and five gang members get shot and killed, but every case of not just shootings of a woman
[00:01:03.854 --> 00:01:16.984]  In Fort Worth, cutting her baby's arms off, or a woman drowning her five children, or a teenager coming in and killing his grandparents and then going out and shooting a bunch of his neighbors and schoolmates.
[00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:31.595]  There has never been a case, and we look at every one of them, not the Virginia Tech-Blacksburg situation, not Kip Kinkle, not Harrison, Kleibold, and Columbine.
[00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:45.525]  Every time I see a police report, there was one a few years ago in Texas, a naked woman at a million dollar house, dancing around naked, stabbing herself with butcher knives, throwing them at police when they showed up.
[00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.126]  I said, well, it'll come out.
[00:01:47.186 --> 00:01:48.586]  She's on antidepressants.
[00:01:49.787 --> 00:01:51.367]  And of course, it came out a day later.
[00:01:51.387 --> 00:01:52.228]  She indeed was.
[00:01:52.268 --> 00:01:54.348]  I mean, it is continual.
[00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.329]  It always is the same.
[00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.731]  And yesterday, within hours of the horrible mall shooting,
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:14.384]  In Omaha, Nebraska, it was on the news that he had been treated psychiatrically, been on Ritalin and serotonin reuptake inhibitors, so both the amphetamines and the hallucinogens.
[00:02:14.464 --> 00:02:17.165]  It's in the hallucinogenic psychotropic class.
[00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:19.545]  That's what class psychotropics are in.
[00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:20.846]  Just read the insert.
[00:02:22.426 --> 00:02:29.869]  And sure enough, they were reporting that his friends, family, neighbors said, oh yeah, he'd all been on the drugs.
[00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:37.133]  Uh, it is appearing that he dropped out of his, quote, counseling lately, and it appears may have gone off the drugs.
[00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:38.054]  That's even worse.
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.285]  You're going to go off, you've got to go off very slowly and ramp it down very, very slowly under a doctor's care.
[00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:50.448]  And of course, people break and kill and hurt themselves when they're on them as well.
[00:02:50.468 --> 00:02:52.889]  Hundreds of percentile points go up.
[00:02:52.929 --> 00:03:04.097]  They even have to admit that now in the drug inserts, in the fine print, with all of these serotonin reuptake inhibitors and similar classes, because they totally jack with the chemical balance of your brain.
[00:03:04.297 --> 00:03:06.018]  They give you a chemical imbalance.
[00:03:06.992 --> 00:03:10.775]  You're now in Toucan Sam land, even if you don't know it.
[00:03:11.396 --> 00:03:12.917]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[00:03:13.177 --> 00:03:15.179]  But it is confirmed that he was on them.
[00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.881]  May have just gone off of them the last few weeks.
[00:03:18.662 --> 00:03:21.925]  And yeah, here comes Johnny.
[00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:25.828]  Serious situation unfolded.
[00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:28.290]  Always the same M.O.
[00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:34.549]  And of course there's calls now for restricting the Second Amendment so we can't defend ourselves.
[00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.454]  Too bad there wasn't someone with a concealed carry who could have taken this guy out quicker.
[00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:51.557]  But you can bet that if there was somebody with a concealed carry who shot him down, or a lot of times these guys see somebody coming with a gun, they'll go ahead and kill themselves instead of killing another 9, 10, 15 people.
[00:03:52.438 --> 00:03:55.540]  And if that is the case, you'll hear about it in a month and it'll be kept very quiet.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.262]  The police won't want that information out.
[00:03:57.662 --> 00:04:05.349]  So we've seen some similar cases where folks with concealed carries have actually neutralized or run the wolf off of their quarry.
[00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.051]  But this guy was just completely out of his gourd.
[00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:10.536]  But it is confirmed he was on the drugs.
[00:04:10.856 --> 00:04:15.798]  They're saying he was on the drugs, but I'm seeing some evidence that he may have gone off treatment in the last two weeks.
[00:04:15.918 --> 00:04:19.419]  Again, you go off these things suddenly, uh-oh!
[00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:20.759]  Uh-oh!
[00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:37.183]  I mean, you can have complete psychotic breaks, and the way it's described by these people and in the different studies that have been done by the drug makers themselves, they knew this in the early 80s and suppressed it with the big granite of mall Prozac, that it's just a hunger to slaughter and kill.
[00:04:38.184 --> 00:04:44.588]  Absolute psychotic spasm of hatred delighting in bloodthirst.
[00:04:45.628 --> 00:04:49.891]  And so there's 20% of the public now on these.
[00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:52.893]  It was 15% and they're all taking time bombs.
[00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:55.114]  Just waiting to go completely psychopathic.
[00:04:55.694 --> 00:04:56.455]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.379]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:05.440]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.192 --> 00:05:11.217]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:11.257 --> 00:05:13.859]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:16.161]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.702 --> 00:05:19.164]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.885 --> 00:05:27.231]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:35.214]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.674 --> 00:05:39.117]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.537 --> 00:05:42.059]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:43.239]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:44.000]  They're not after money.
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.120]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:46.061]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:47.182]  That's what they're after.

[00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:07.714]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.754 --> 00:08:10.556]  Well, we brought you Pat Buchanan yesterday.
[00:08:17.268 --> 00:08:21.792]  Today we've got Jason Vermas joining us with a real treat.
[00:08:21.832 --> 00:08:39.168]  We're going to play about 15 minutes of different clips from Loose Change the final cut and really get into how this is a completely new film and all the new revelations that it brings forward coming up in the second hour today.
[00:08:39.588 --> 00:08:43.412]  Then in the third hour we are scheduled to have Robert Baerb
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:50.943]  One of the most highly decorated CIA field officers, field commanders in U.S.
[00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:54.305]  history, and he's only on with us for like 20 minutes.
[00:08:57.527 --> 00:09:09.473]  Of course, on the Tom Hartman Show, last year he was asked about 9-11 having an inside job aspect, and he said, well, the evidence does point at that.
[00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:17.857]  Now we'll see, he got a lot of heat for that, we'll see what he says today on this broadcast, on this transmission.
[00:09:18.577 --> 00:09:28.719]  And we're also going to get his take on Iran, what's developing there, what's happening there with Robert Baer coming up in the third hour today.
[00:09:31.939 --> 00:09:38.721]  In the meantime, we're going to get into what's happening with housing and it's
[00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:43.367]  Unraveling faster than I even have been predicting it would.
[00:09:43.387 --> 00:09:46.469]  This is not a good thing.
[00:09:46.489 --> 00:09:49.330]  I mean, I am not normally anxiety stricken.
[00:09:49.571 --> 00:09:51.351]  In fact, I normally don't have a lot of anxiety.
[00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:55.233]  And I keep talking about it because everybody I know says they feel the same way.
[00:09:55.634 --> 00:10:02.257]  This feeling of foreboding is just getting more intense.
[00:10:04.358 --> 00:10:07.980]  And there's so many things, not just on the horizon, but are now on our doorstep.
[00:10:08.638 --> 00:10:18.701]  I like the unraveling subprime overall crises that ties into derivatives and all the corporate paper that's been sold and leveraged to the infinity.
[00:10:20.482 --> 00:10:29.144]  The situation with Iran seems to be finally having some signs that it could be de-escalating.
[00:10:29.744 --> 00:10:30.805]  I prayed for that.
[00:10:30.925 --> 00:10:31.545]  Thank God.
[00:10:31.565 --> 00:10:32.485]  I hope that's the case.
[00:10:33.245 --> 00:10:34.606]  We'll talk to Bear about that today.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:42.201]  And the neocons are like cornered rats right now, which makes them so incredibly more dangerous.
[00:10:42.861 --> 00:10:45.262]  False flag is definitely in the cards.
[00:10:45.302 --> 00:10:46.782]  I don't know if that's what's going to be dealt.
[00:10:49.883 --> 00:10:51.943]  I don't think the New World Order even knows what they're going to do right now.
[00:10:51.963 --> 00:10:56.124]  I think they're kind of watching and waiting because there's so much resistance to them.
[00:10:56.284 --> 00:10:57.784]  But they're going to make some move.
[00:10:57.804 --> 00:10:58.845]  You can be assured of that.
[00:10:59.385 --> 00:11:05.206]  They haven't gotten where they're at because they don't have the will to take reckless, dangerous actions.
[00:11:06.363 --> 00:11:12.985]  But perhaps we should open the phones up in this hour to talk about what you think is going to happen next year.
[00:11:13.725 --> 00:11:21.227]  Are you having feelings of foreboding or in your own intellectual analysis of the geopolitical climate?
[00:11:22.187 --> 00:11:26.168]  Do you think things have a good outlook, a bad outlook?
[00:11:26.488 --> 00:11:28.809]  Maybe you're feeling upbeat.
[00:11:28.849 --> 00:11:32.590]  Everybody I talk to says they do feel a very strong foreboding.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:41.765]  And I felt one similar to this, though it was much lighter in the lead-up to September 11th.
[00:11:42.206 --> 00:11:53.453]  Not just the 3,000 deaths, but the geopolitical shift into tyranny that we saw, and now the counterbalance swing by the pendulum against that.
[00:11:54.393 --> 00:11:59.737]  But how effective will that counter-swing
[00:12:01.171 --> 00:12:06.015]  That is the 64 million dollar question.
[00:12:08.036 --> 00:12:11.819]  So, let me just go through some of the news I have here in front of me today.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.343]  Omaha gunman made call about suicide note.
[00:12:18.243 --> 00:12:29.131]  You read into this article, you read into the KETV article, and it reports that he was under psychiatric care, that he was seeing a psychiatrist, psychologist as well.
[00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:51.962]  uh... that uh... several reports here and we have a little different pieces of uh... a friend of hawk and sean told katv news watch seven so hawkins had been on antidepressants he was staying with friends in quail creek a friend said and he had hawkins had recently begun bouncing from job to job and making some bad judgment calls he lost his job at mcdonald's lost his girlfriend
[00:12:53.701 --> 00:12:57.144]  And somehow came into possession of the wicked SKS.
[00:12:57.604 --> 00:13:01.527]  And now it's nine dead, including the gunman.
[00:13:03.328 --> 00:13:04.469]  So we'll go over that also.
[00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:06.370]  Housing prices seen falling 30%.
[00:13:07.251 --> 00:13:13.916]  Depending on which index you look at, but an overall national index shows about a 15% drop just this year.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.041]  And there are some areas they've seen over a 30% drop.
[00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:26.983]  They're talking about a 30% drop across the nation by the middle of next year.
[00:13:27.003 --> 00:13:28.043]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:13:28.944 --> 00:13:31.804]  Home foreclosures have gotten so bad in the Minneapolis-St.
[00:13:31.884 --> 00:13:41.647]  Paul Twin Cities area that folks are supposed to shovel out their own driveway and try to shovel out an opening to the street.
[00:13:42.207 --> 00:13:43.708]  So many homes have been foreclosed there.
[00:13:44.466 --> 00:13:47.748]  That it says that it's blocking up streets and really causing a big problem.
[00:13:47.768 --> 00:13:50.290]  That's Eyewitness ABC 5.
[00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.071]  Another report here from Lou Rockwell.
[00:13:53.151 --> 00:13:54.172]  Economic Outlook at 08.
[00:13:54.452 --> 00:13:55.713]  Darkening clouds.
[00:13:56.933 --> 00:13:59.435]  The dollar's perfect storm by MSN.
[00:13:59.455 --> 00:14:02.056]  Another report here.
[00:14:02.177 --> 00:14:05.559]  Texas to track emergency evacuees using RFID.
[00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:12.903]  House vote on illegal images sweeps in Wi-Fi websites.
[00:14:13.755 --> 00:14:30.505]  And they're saying anybody that offers Wi-Fi in a hotel, a coffee shop, in a gym, in a restaurant, that shows, quote, illegal images, and you think, oh my gosh, that means child porn.
[00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:31.205]  No, it doesn't.
[00:14:32.085 --> 00:14:42.191]  It says cartoons, drawings, anything that's obscene, cuss words, that it's criminal, $300,000 fine.
[00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:46.931]  And it said they snuck this through the house yesterday.
[00:14:46.951 --> 00:14:50.193]  They want to regulate the web, folks.
[00:14:50.213 --> 00:14:51.113]  They want to shut it down.
[00:14:51.153 --> 00:14:52.154]  They want to come after people.
[00:14:52.214 --> 00:14:55.036]  And when you let them engage in any regulation of it, it's over.
[00:14:56.096 --> 00:14:58.057]  They get their camel's nose under the tent flap.
[00:14:58.077 --> 00:14:59.218]  We're going to be outside the tent.
[00:14:59.238 --> 00:15:00.519]  They're going to be sitting inside the tent.
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.422]  All the UN and our government runs giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:11.593]  The world sex trade and controls it, and the banks launder the money off of it, and that's all been all over the news.
[00:15:11.653 --> 00:15:15.916]  Meanwhile, they're going to stop you from seeing someone, you know, saying the poopy word.
[00:15:15.936 --> 00:15:18.398]  Oh boy, please save us.
[00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:27.884]  So it says anybody who transmits public, unfiltered internet access, including libraries now.
[00:15:30.045 --> 00:15:32.767]  Again, it's up to parents to control their children.
[00:15:33.507 --> 00:15:35.549]  You are not going to stop them from getting around this.
[00:15:36.733 --> 00:15:46.003]  And then once they make every wireless provider, broadband provider, do this, they'll then buy all these different filtering packages.
[00:15:46.043 --> 00:15:51.209]  Every filtering package we've seen out there that universities and libraries already use filters out, guess who?
[00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:56.995]  Alejandro Jones, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:15:57.436 --> 00:15:58.657]  Whenever we start a new website like
[00:15:59.594 --> 00:16:02.160]  We'll start promoting it like jonesreportedtruthnews.us.
[00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:06.249]  For about six months a year we're not in the databases and then we are and then we're blocked out.
[00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.955]  Most corporations, most libraries, most colleges.
[00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:12.591]  military computers because they have four different categories.
[00:16:12.611 --> 00:16:18.956]  They have hate that's banned, they have hacking that's banned, they have porn that's banned, and they have gambling that's banned.
[00:16:19.356 --> 00:16:25.522]  That is the four things that filter companies in the clauses when employees work at Dell Computer or elsewhere.
[00:16:25.542 --> 00:16:27.824]  A lot of folks have been fired for visiting Infowars.
[00:16:27.864 --> 00:16:28.564]  It doesn't filter.
[00:16:28.924 --> 00:16:30.005]  If you go there, you're fired.
[00:16:30.426 --> 00:16:32.387]  And they say, well, that's under the hate category.
[00:16:32.427 --> 00:16:34.149]  Your contract says you're allowed to serve at lunch.
[00:16:35.087 --> 00:16:37.429]  Or for research or for sales and sales departments.
[00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:43.633]  But you visited the hate site, Infowars.com.
[00:16:44.233 --> 00:16:45.214]  You are fired!
[00:16:46.075 --> 00:16:48.356]  I know Dell employees in Texas, I know personally have been fired.
[00:16:48.696 --> 00:16:53.660]  And then I've gotten emails and calls and copies of the letter how they were fired from Dell in Tennessee.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.540]  That's just Dell.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.423]  There's literally hundreds of other examples just of us being filtered.
[00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:02.866]  But that's just some of the news there.
[00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:08.831]  Right now, let me go ahead and get into this situation with the gunman.
[00:17:10.292 --> 00:17:23.515]  Robert A. Hawkins went into the Omaha, Nebraska mall, as I'm sure you've already heard 15 million times, yesterday, and shot and killed now nine people.
[00:17:23.555 --> 00:17:29.996]  It was eight, but another person, unfortunately, has died from wounds, I guess from the 7.6239
[00:17:33.812 --> 00:17:35.494]  We're good to go!
[00:18:00.493 --> 00:18:04.194]  Better chance of being struck by lightning than being shot by a mass shooter.
[00:18:05.734 --> 00:18:08.455]  Better chance of being struck by lightning twice than dying from terrorism.
[00:18:08.475 --> 00:18:10.835]  That's actual official numbers in the World Almanac.
[00:18:12.316 --> 00:18:18.717]  Hundreds of times better chance of grounding or dying in a car wreck or having a heart attack or dying of cancer.
[00:18:18.837 --> 00:18:20.677]  It's way down the list of things that kill you.
[00:18:21.478 --> 00:18:28.039]  More people died, and this has been the same the last five years running, in high school football accidents.
[00:18:28.877 --> 00:18:31.098]  That's right, and then die in school shootings.
[00:18:31.639 --> 00:18:32.159]  Did you know that?
[00:18:32.199 --> 00:18:41.525]  There are upwards some years I've seen as high as 25 people die because I've given speeches on that and pulled those numbers up, but you can pull it up yourself.
[00:18:41.765 --> 00:18:53.392]  But I remember one year, it was five, six years ago, it was 25 people died in high school football, breaking their necks, getting concussions, having subdermal hematomas.
[00:18:54.392 --> 00:18:58.555]  But still, it is a scary prospect of these people stomping around.
[00:18:59.961 --> 00:19:03.283]  And I hate to go over all these examples, but you remember them.
[00:19:05.084 --> 00:19:11.748]  Every time a woman drowns their children in a bathtub or puts them in a car and drives them off a cliff into a quarry or into a river.
[00:19:11.768 --> 00:19:13.890]  Been a couple cases of that in the last year.
[00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:18.653]  The woman just flips out, sick of the kids whining and whatever.
[00:19:18.673 --> 00:19:24.816]  Or she's got some new boyfriend that she wants to leave the kids for, but no one will take the kids.
[00:19:25.177 --> 00:19:26.578]  She doesn't know she can give them to grandma.
[00:19:26.938 --> 00:19:28.459]  So she just drives them off a cliff.
[00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.032]  Uh, that seems to be one of their favorite things to do.
[00:19:32.052 --> 00:19:35.835]  Uh, every time they walk into a school and blast a bunch of people.
[00:19:36.416 --> 00:19:39.158]  The last case, a couple years ago in Minnesota, remember that kid shooting a bunch of people?
[00:19:40.019 --> 00:19:41.580]  On the Indian Reservation Public School?
[00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:44.823]  Uh, he was, uh, Prozac'd up.
[00:19:45.683 --> 00:19:47.585]  He was on one of those, uh, serotonin-rich pig inhibitors.
[00:19:48.166 --> 00:19:49.467]  Same thing with this, uh, guy.
[00:19:50.347 --> 00:19:53.090]  And we'll explain exactly why that happens when we get back.
[00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:57.333]  Because I've interviewed scores of top medical doctors on this subject.
[00:19:57.674 --> 00:19:58.034]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.621 --> 00:20:02.061]  Gold.
[00:20:02.422 --> 00:20:03.683]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:20:03.963 --> 00:20:10.049]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:14.053]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:20:14.414 --> 00:20:16.296]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:20:16.356 --> 00:20:18.638]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:20:18.778 --> 00:20:25.645]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every
[00:20:25.865 --> 00:20:26.966]  We're good to go.
[00:20:41.152 --> 00:20:41.973]  We're good to go.
[00:21:01.161 --> 00:21:06.665]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:21:07.085 --> 00:21:11.329]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:21:11.749 --> 00:21:18.594]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:21:19.034 --> 00:21:25.741]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:21:26.061 --> 00:21:27.682]  There are no reported side effects.
[00:21:27.983 --> 00:21:31.166]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:21:31.446 --> 00:21:33.888]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:21:34.208 --> 00:21:40.935]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:21:41.375 --> 00:21:44.056]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:21:44.316 --> 00:21:47.678]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll free at 866-885-6625.
[00:21:47.738 --> 00:21:48.098]  That's 866-885-6625.
[00:21:48.138 --> 00:21:49.899]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[00:22:02.048 --> 00:22:04.109]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:04.729 --> 00:22:13.653]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.113 --> 00:22:21.296]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:27.513]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:38.841]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:39.601 --> 00:22:41.663]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:22:42.163 --> 00:22:43.584]  For more information, call 702-953-0111.
[00:22:50.325 --> 00:22:51.066]  We're good to go.
[00:23:00.899 --> 00:23:01.560]  It's a fact.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:09.246]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:23:09.386 --> 00:23:18.253]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:23:18.513 --> 00:23:29.061]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:23:29.321 --> 00:23:35.383]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:23:35.583 --> 00:23:40.624]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:23:40.784 --> 00:23:45.286]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:23:45.446 --> 00:23:47.246]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:23:47.266 --> 00:23:47.566]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:23:47.586 --> 00:23:48.086]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:23:48.106 --> 00:23:49.967]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:23:57.409 --> 00:23:59.671]  Is it getting better?
[00:23:59.851 --> 00:24:04.975]  Or do you feel the same?
[00:24:05.015 --> 00:24:09.858]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.610]  We're back live!
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.641]  Let's go ahead and get into this, Gunman.
[00:25:04.542 --> 00:25:11.525]  You know it'd be one thing if it was half of the shooters that go into schools or malls or churches and shoot everybody.
[00:25:11.545 --> 00:25:21.650]  Remember Larry Ashbrook up in Fort Worth went into the Baptist Church at a youth meeting and I think he killed like 15 people and then shot himself or maybe it was more.
[00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:22.991]  That was a lot of people he killed.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:34.049]  Turned out he'd actually been in a CIA mind control program in the Navy, and turned out he'd been completely normal until he started saying that he'd been told to kill everybody.
[00:25:34.089 --> 00:25:41.897]  And the neighbors did see him being drug out of his house and put in a black van, and he did call the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and say, I've been told to kill everybody, please stop me.
[00:25:41.917 --> 00:25:44.419]  And he called the police, and they didn't come and get him.
[00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:46.672]  But maybe he was just crazy.
[00:25:47.133 --> 00:25:49.935]  And maybe neighbors imagine that black van and him being drugged around.
[00:25:50.896 --> 00:25:57.282]  Because you don't need to have the CIA do this when you're on the serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:25:57.562 --> 00:26:00.224]  But it'd be one thing if it was even 90% or 95%.
[00:26:02.586 --> 00:26:09.032]  But every case of mass shooting, every time, I mean I keep waiting for it not to be,
[00:26:10.189 --> 00:26:12.490]  I keep waiting for the new mass shooting to not be.
[00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:13.790]  I mean, go look at it for yourself.
[00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.031]  We ought to do an article about that.
[00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:18.312]  And not just about this latest guy being on Prozac.
[00:26:18.332 --> 00:26:19.312]  I know Steve's doing one.
[00:26:20.773 --> 00:26:22.893]  They won't see what type of serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[00:26:22.933 --> 00:26:27.475]  It's a whole family, but it's like there's 15 brands of Coca-Cola flavored soft drinks.
[00:26:27.895 --> 00:26:29.775]  RC Cola, Coca-Cola, Pepsi.
[00:26:30.756 --> 00:26:31.916]  There's a whole bunch of brands.
[00:26:31.976 --> 00:26:32.736]  It's the same thing.
[00:26:32.796 --> 00:26:33.517]  It tastes the same.
[00:26:33.557 --> 00:26:34.317]  It does the same thing.
[00:26:34.838 --> 00:26:41.383]  There's different combinations and strengths, so we don't know which type of serotonin reuptake inhibitor, but they admit he was on them.
[00:26:42.423 --> 00:26:43.344]  Anne Ridland, by the way.
[00:26:44.725 --> 00:26:45.826]  Harris was on both.
[00:26:46.506 --> 00:26:48.147]  Kleibo was only on antidepressants.
[00:26:48.548 --> 00:26:58.695]  The mixture is particularly volatile, and the psychologists and psychiatrists don't even debate whether there's drug-mixing problems.
[00:26:58.715 --> 00:26:59.455]  They just do it.
[00:27:01.014 --> 00:27:06.795]  Give somebody a high-powered amphetamine, that's what it is, and then go ahead and mix it up with a hallucinogen.
[00:27:07.715 --> 00:27:10.936]  And the psychotropics are in the hallucinogenic family.
[00:27:11.656 --> 00:27:13.216]  Go look it up in encyclopedia.
[00:27:13.616 --> 00:27:16.837]  Go look it up in the different medical dictionaries that are online, mainstream.
[00:27:17.357 --> 00:27:26.279]  They are in the hallucinogenic family, but they only put you into kind of a dazed, subconscious sleepwalking state.
[00:27:26.299 --> 00:27:26.999]  In fact, they put
[00:27:27.657 --> 00:27:28.418]  We're good to go!
[00:27:53.809 --> 00:28:21.577]  Sometimes you just have absolutely horrible feelings of intense suicide, or just as often, and this is now in the inserts, they've had to add this the last few years, we knew this back in the 80s, their own internal trials of Prozac, which they suppressed, this is all mainstream news, showed massive increases in suicide and violent acting out, and in some cases it causes hardcore violent psychotic breaks, just where they
[00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:22.790]  We're good to go.
[00:28:45.041 --> 00:28:46.762]  She was on four different ones.
[00:28:47.603 --> 00:28:52.706]  And as they get more and more whacked out, it's a perfect product, they tell you, oh, the answer is more.
[00:28:52.727 --> 00:29:13.421]  Now remember, WOII Television did an investigation last year, now it's two years ago, and found that, we already knew this, but they found it, so we can say they reported it, that in Texas, more than two-thirds of foster children are on an average, but two-thirds are on the drugs, but an average is on seven.
[00:29:14.033 --> 00:29:17.215]  And they found somewheres on as many as 18 drugs.
[00:29:17.716 --> 00:29:19.897]  And if they get you on 5, 10, depends on the person.
[00:29:19.917 --> 00:29:20.998]  These are having seizures.
[00:29:21.478 --> 00:29:27.742]  Then the seizure money comes in and then you get to get even bigger money to social services on hospitalization.
[00:29:28.543 --> 00:29:32.265]  Oh, they actually hospitalize you with the drugs and then you, a lot of them die.
[00:29:32.806 --> 00:29:34.587]  But there's just massive money in that.
[00:29:35.267 --> 00:29:37.789]  They also get insurance policies on the children they murder.
[00:29:38.587 --> 00:29:40.429]  Oh, big cash there.
[00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:43.772]  And the big private facilities really cash in.
[00:29:44.473 --> 00:29:46.375]  So we'll continue to discuss this when we get back.
[00:29:47.136 --> 00:29:48.698]  And exactly why you have psychotic breaks.
[00:29:51.881 --> 00:29:52.822]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.262 --> 00:29:54.904]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.785 --> 00:29:58.508]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:33:18.798 --> 00:33:23.281]  All right, we're gonna go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:49.058 --> 00:34:01.625]  But just finishing up, I'm not kidding, I had already found those numbers and seen that in the press, that the national average is a little bit above two-thirds of foster children on these drugs.
[00:34:02.386 --> 00:34:06.848]  And that's an example of what the government would do when they've got somebody in their clutches.
[00:34:07.814 --> 00:34:22.103]  Oh, two-thirds of the children are mentally ill, and so we're run by the drug companies, and that is the foster system, the CPS, the whole apparatus.
[00:34:22.143 --> 00:34:32.849]  And so, because we're run by that, they've written the federal and state laws where we get even more money per child if they're a special needs child,
[00:34:34.173 --> 00:34:39.238]  So, of course, more than two-thirds are special needs and need to be on psychiatric drugs.
[00:34:39.579 --> 00:34:44.423]  And then, you see, when you take the four-year-old or the two-year-old from mommy and daddy, they cry.
[00:34:45.244 --> 00:34:46.445]  And that's mental illness.
[00:34:47.306 --> 00:34:52.812]  And so the on-site psychologist or psychiatrist drops by and first gives them sedatives.
[00:34:53.993 --> 00:35:05.021]  Baby gets things like Valium, and if they keep throwing fits, they'll get antipsychotics even stronger than Prozac, things that actually cause brain damage.
[00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:06.622]  Go look that up for yourself.
[00:35:07.423 --> 00:35:12.406]  And so then they give them brain damage type drugs that are so hardcore they cause brain damage.
[00:35:13.274 --> 00:35:15.716]  And then they diagnose them once they settle down.
[00:35:15.736 --> 00:35:18.398]  They're little zombies and watch TV as much as they want.
[00:35:18.438 --> 00:35:19.939]  It can be 15 hours a day.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:20.860]  It's just unlimited.
[00:35:21.481 --> 00:35:27.566]  All the insane, you know, Spongebob and the rest of it that, you know, that adults can hardly get, you know, much less a kid.
[00:35:27.986 --> 00:35:30.488]  And then they put you on one serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[00:35:30.688 --> 00:35:33.851]  But then you're hyper watching TV and drinking soft drinks all day.
[00:35:33.891 --> 00:35:35.192]  So then they put you on a red one.
[00:35:35.712 --> 00:35:37.233]  Then you start having heart palpitations.
[00:35:37.273 --> 00:35:39.073]  They put you on a medication for that.
[00:35:39.573 --> 00:35:40.834]  Start having seizures.
[00:35:41.294 --> 00:35:42.534]  Put you on something for that.
[00:35:42.895 --> 00:35:44.395]  Start having more anxiety.
[00:35:44.815 --> 00:35:45.996]  Now you're four years old.
[00:35:46.016 --> 00:35:47.456]  You've been in their clutches two years.
[00:35:47.516 --> 00:35:48.717]  You're starting to die.
[00:35:49.417 --> 00:35:52.758]  You look like a little zombie with big black circles around your eyes.
[00:35:53.118 --> 00:35:55.139]  Now you're on five psychotropics.
[00:35:55.199 --> 00:35:56.159]  Two amphetamines.
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.200]  Then you have the seizure.
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.361]  Even stronger medication.
[00:36:01.481 --> 00:36:03.702]  Oh, now you're in a padded cell.
[00:36:04.651 --> 00:36:07.133]  Oh, you're 15, you're dead.
[00:36:07.153 --> 00:36:10.135]  And they go and they put you in a little grave.
[00:36:11.356 --> 00:36:12.377]  It's just so good.
[00:36:12.437 --> 00:36:14.779]  The government's so good.
[00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:17.541]  They do so much good.
[00:36:17.561 --> 00:36:22.384]  And as horrible as what I just told you sounds, that's it.
[00:36:22.424 --> 00:36:23.825]  It's like shake and bake.
[00:36:24.566 --> 00:36:27.048]  It's like getting pancake mix out and making some pancakes.
[00:36:27.308 --> 00:36:28.068]  All you add is milk.
[00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:30.170]  It's a formula.
[00:36:31.414 --> 00:36:37.658]  They just take the child, take them, and the average child's on seven drugs, more than two-thirds are on it in foster care.
[00:36:37.678 --> 00:36:54.047]  And I know I'm digressing off into this, and then the state legislature last year was asking the head of the state board that oversees all this, they asked the psychologist, psychiatrist, he's in game, they said, well, why are more than two-thirds of them on the drugs, and why are they on so many?
[00:36:54.467 --> 00:36:56.829]  And he said, they have bad gene pools, they have bad genetics.
[00:36:58.564 --> 00:37:02.066]  No genetic test was done, there's no proof of that, it's just, it's eugenics!
[00:37:02.306 --> 00:37:03.227]  They have bad genes!
[00:37:03.667 --> 00:37:06.348]  Yeah, yeah, yeah!
[00:37:06.408 --> 00:37:09.230]  And we're gonna put them on these drugs, and this is what's gonna happen.
[00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:22.417]  And then they get institutionalized for life, if they do live, most of them live, by the time they're 18, we're about to get out, then they just put them in the state hospitals, and they're just completely, their brains are completely gone.
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:30.345]  I mean, they're completely fried, and then they tend to shut down the bigger state hospitals, and then they just dump them out on the street.
[00:37:31.145 --> 00:37:33.887]  And so you see them all over the street corner, begging for money.
[00:37:34.347 --> 00:37:35.488]  And they look like zombies.
[00:37:36.169 --> 00:37:37.049]  They are zombies.
[00:37:37.469 --> 00:37:43.013]  You see them talking to themselves, and they're just, they have the minds of three-year-olds.
[00:37:43.033 --> 00:37:46.956]  And I've gone and talked to them, and I'll say, let me guess, tell me your story.
[00:37:48.726 --> 00:37:59.509]  Well I was three when they came because I was bad and took me and then when I was a big man, eighteen, they put me out.
[00:38:00.149 --> 00:38:02.830]  I've been on the street for twelve years.
[00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:04.311]  I ought to make a film about that.
[00:38:05.151 --> 00:38:05.471]  Really.
[00:38:05.871 --> 00:38:08.212]  And then I got into drugs on the street.
[00:38:08.572 --> 00:38:10.193]  Because they were already totally addicted to them.
[00:38:11.153 --> 00:38:14.794]  And then they can't steal anymore because they're so burnt out and they just zombie around.
[00:38:19.173 --> 00:38:21.615]  But some people don't get to zombie level.
[00:38:22.376 --> 00:38:25.358]  Some people have the hardcore violent psychotic break.
[00:38:25.679 --> 00:38:32.024]  They lock and load and they go in and start blasting people or they chop their baby's arms off or stick them in the microwave.
[00:38:32.064 --> 00:38:33.385]  I forgot there's a bunch of cases of that.
[00:38:33.545 --> 00:38:34.346]  They're always on it.
[00:38:34.786 --> 00:38:41.472]  Because people don't do things like that unless they're hopped up on multiple psychotropics!
[00:38:45.879 --> 00:38:48.560]  People don't stick babies in microwaves.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:53.282]  People don't drive their three kids in booster seats into the cold river.
[00:38:54.183 --> 00:38:55.323]  Into the Detroit River.
[00:38:55.784 --> 00:38:59.065]  People don't do things like that.
[00:38:59.365 --> 00:39:04.007]  They don't walk into malls and walk up to women shopping and splatter their heads.
[00:39:06.168 --> 00:39:09.530]  Unless they're already disturbed and then put on hard core.
[00:39:10.865 --> 00:39:16.328]  Drugs, and then the media advertises that that's what they're supposed to do and advertises all day.
[00:39:16.368 --> 00:39:18.048]  There's this big epidemic of it.
[00:39:18.068 --> 00:39:20.109]  Alright, I've already digressed off the map here.
[00:39:25.572 --> 00:39:34.356]  So two years ago, four years ago in Europe, two years ago in the US, they forced serotonin reuptake inhibitor families, the family of these drugs, and they got stuff even worse now.
[00:39:35.236 --> 00:39:38.918]  I mean, this just messed with serotonin, which jacks with the whole brain chemistry and levels.
[00:39:40.365 --> 00:39:40.785]  We're good to go!
[00:40:06.907 --> 00:40:07.808]  I don't know.
[00:40:18.485 --> 00:40:24.052]  Now if you have a car wreck, now people that have surgeries, the hospitals will come in and say, how are you feeling?
[00:40:24.232 --> 00:40:32.723]  Three days after you've had half your colon removed, or after you've had your esophagus radiated, or I'm really depressed, Doc.
[00:40:33.303 --> 00:40:35.085]  Well, we've got something for you.
[00:40:35.105 --> 00:40:37.929]  We're going to have the hospital counselor see you.
[00:40:38.951 --> 00:40:43.653]  And then she comes in, or he comes in, and says, yeah, I want to try these out.
[00:40:44.033 --> 00:40:46.674]  Take these for a couple months, and I'm going to come back in.
[00:40:46.694 --> 00:40:48.735]  After you're out of the hospital, I want you to come in.
[00:40:48.755 --> 00:40:49.835]  Of course, this is business for them.
[00:40:49.856 --> 00:40:50.776]  They're going to get money for this.
[00:40:51.376 --> 00:40:52.337]  I want you to come in and talk to me.
[00:40:52.357 --> 00:40:53.917]  And you come in, and you're like, yeah, I'm feeling better.
[00:40:54.137 --> 00:40:54.978]  Well, of course you are!
[00:40:55.998 --> 00:40:59.079]  You know, you've been out of the hospital a month after you had your colon chopped out.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:04.121]  Or your, or your, or your, you know, that car wreck and had your jaw broken.
[00:41:04.141 --> 00:41:05.622]  You're not drinking out of a straw anymore.
[00:41:07.265 --> 00:41:08.806]  And now you're on happy drugs.
[00:41:08.866 --> 00:41:10.186]  Man, you're taking stuff.
[00:41:11.086 --> 00:41:13.227]  It's all based on fluoride molecules.
[00:41:14.027 --> 00:41:15.808]  Well, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors are.
[00:41:16.128 --> 00:41:17.148]  And then they jack with that.
[00:41:17.188 --> 00:41:19.489]  I mean, this stuff is rat poison.
[00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.670]  Oh, and it feels real good.
[00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:23.911]  Why do you think alcohol feels real good?
[00:41:23.951 --> 00:41:25.171]  That's just a base poison.
[00:41:25.851 --> 00:41:27.292]  You're drinking a poison.
[00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:29.573]  It's going around inside your body.
[00:41:29.633 --> 00:41:30.813]  It's going into your brain.
[00:41:30.833 --> 00:41:33.934]  And that's child's play.
[00:41:34.414 --> 00:41:35.855]  Child's play.
[00:41:39.253 --> 00:41:40.414]  Nicotine's a poison.
[00:41:40.454 --> 00:41:41.454]  That's an old mob trick.
[00:41:41.494 --> 00:41:43.995]  They'd wear plastic gloves under leather gloves.
[00:41:44.035 --> 00:41:45.235]  You would notice they were wearing gloves.
[00:41:45.796 --> 00:41:48.036]  And they'd, uh, you know, in the wintertime.
[00:41:48.056 --> 00:41:50.397]  The point is, I'm getting off on the side issues how they'd kill people.
[00:41:50.617 --> 00:41:53.919]  The point is, they'd wear a plastic glove, come up, and dump it on you.
[00:41:54.019 --> 00:41:54.979]  Or shake your hand.
[00:41:55.439 --> 00:41:57.060]  Or put it on the inside of your shirt.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:02.242]  And man, that nicotine goes through, and baby, you're gonna have a big heart attack real fast.
[00:42:02.722 --> 00:42:04.222]  And all those vessels clamp down.
[00:42:06.583 --> 00:42:07.324]  You're gonna die.
[00:42:07.344 --> 00:42:08.384]  A couple drops of that stuff.
[00:42:11.405 --> 00:42:13.085]  But I'm already digressing here.
[00:42:13.946 --> 00:42:18.227]  They have put, I don't know, it was 15%, now they say it's approaching 20.
[00:42:19.147 --> 00:42:20.427]  But I still see the old number, too.
[00:42:20.467 --> 00:42:21.207]  But let's just say 15%.
[00:42:22.608 --> 00:42:23.868]  Of the countries now on these.
[00:42:25.188 --> 00:42:35.851]  We got the New Freedom Initiative documents two years ago when one of the board members of the New Freedom Initiative went public out of Ohio, that the President's plan was written up by the drug companies, as if we didn't already know that.
[00:42:36.371 --> 00:42:38.512]  And that they said, well, we've already got 15% of the youth on them.
[00:42:40.177 --> 00:43:00.604]  Our goal is by 2010, that's just a few years from now now, how time flies, that was in 2005, I guess that was in five years, wasn't two years ago, that was three years ago now, they said we want to have 50% at least of American school children on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:43:02.805 --> 00:43:06.046]  And now it's pushing 20% of adults and children.
[00:43:07.285 --> 00:43:11.066]  And, uh, I know you're out there driving around in your Prozac and you don't want to hear this from me.
[00:43:11.386 --> 00:43:13.366]  Hey, it might be okay for some people.
[00:43:13.406 --> 00:43:20.107]  Some people, there's some people who can drink a bottle of Jack Daniels every day and smoke three packs of cigarettes and die when they're 97 mountain men.
[00:43:20.687 --> 00:43:23.108]  If they had genes, they probably would have lived to be 110.
[00:43:23.868 --> 00:43:27.789]  Most of us don't have, uh, Titan genes, or whatever you want to call them.
[00:43:28.969 --> 00:43:29.389]  Uh, you know.
[00:43:30.209 --> 00:43:35.150]  But, uh, I don't know what I'm going to say to you.
[00:43:36.178 --> 00:43:38.341]  But surely don't go off those things quickly.
[00:43:39.542 --> 00:43:43.947]  I mean, I see cases every week in the news where somebody gets put in jail for a week.
[00:43:44.027 --> 00:43:48.712]  They don't give them their Prozac or their Luvox, again, the whole class of the drug.
[00:43:49.172 --> 00:43:50.854]  And that's the person that hangs themselves.
[00:43:53.657 --> 00:43:57.061]  You know, within a day, they are just completely in hell.
[00:43:59.076 --> 00:44:01.138]  So we know what these drugs are doing.
[00:44:01.198 --> 00:44:02.839]  We know what's happening.
[00:44:03.059 --> 00:44:04.100]  And what is the system doing?
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.242]  Oh, it's not enough to have 20% on.
[00:44:06.663 --> 00:44:08.384]  We want half of the people on them.
[00:44:10.786 --> 00:44:17.732]  And it doesn't matter that every case of a woman dancing around on top of a roof with butcher knives, naked,
[00:44:18.584 --> 00:44:20.745]  Every case of somebody putting the baby in the microwave.
[00:44:21.206 --> 00:44:25.168]  Every case... I mean, just every case of people blowing their kids' heads off.
[00:44:25.588 --> 00:44:26.989]  Every case of... Every case!
[00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.609]  Every case!
[00:44:27.649 --> 00:44:28.750]  And I know you're out there listening.
[00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:31.251]  You've noticed in every case they say they're on these drugs.
[00:44:34.153 --> 00:44:34.713]  Every case!
[00:44:35.814 --> 00:44:38.415]  Never seen it where it isn't.
[00:44:38.896 --> 00:44:39.156]  Never.
[00:44:39.916 --> 00:44:40.176]  Never.
[00:44:41.697 --> 00:44:42.237]  Not once.
[00:44:43.138 --> 00:44:43.318]  Ever.
[00:44:45.279 --> 00:44:46.640]  Absolute proof.
[00:44:47.603 --> 00:44:53.006]  And you go look at what the drug does, you go look at what it does to your brain, of course this happens.
[00:44:54.227 --> 00:45:04.314]  Oh yeah, you're going to be real happy 360 days out of the year, but 5 days out of the year, with some people it might be 100 days out of the year.
[00:45:05.094 --> 00:45:06.815]  Some people it may be no days out of the year.
[00:45:07.075 --> 00:45:08.656]  But it doesn't matter, it's Russian Roulette.
[00:45:09.057 --> 00:45:15.801]  You're going to be a psychopathic killer, just literally craved, thinking about how you want to murder people.
[00:45:17.368 --> 00:45:19.450]  Oh, it's just like LSD.
[00:45:21.172 --> 00:45:22.673]  Oh, it's real fun!
[00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:35.846]  You know, you take it 50 times, but that 51st trip, or it might be the 1st trip, it might be the 10th trip, it might be the 100th, you have an absolute psychotic break and go jump out a window.
[00:45:36.347 --> 00:45:37.368]  Or go kill your family.
[00:45:37.708 --> 00:45:40.451]  These are dangerous, dangerous drugs.
[00:45:42.128 --> 00:45:45.610]  And so I don't want to hear the SWAT teams and the cops in your war on drugs.
[00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:47.091]  Give me a break!
[00:45:48.252 --> 00:45:57.699]  The serotonin reuptake inhibitors, molecules, are more dangerous, more toxic, and I've had medical scientists and doctors on to cover this.
[00:45:57.719 --> 00:45:58.839]  It's not my opinion.
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:05.964]  Than LSD, than peyote, than even PCP.
[00:46:06.464 --> 00:46:08.085]  But they give it in lower dosages.
[00:46:08.266 --> 00:46:10.267]  But then you get a resistance and it builds up.
[00:46:12.699 --> 00:46:13.779]  And then people abuse them.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.520]  I don't use your dope.
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.540]  I don't use your cocaine.
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:19.721]  I don't use your heroin.
[00:46:19.821 --> 00:46:21.361]  I don't use any of your crud.
[00:46:21.741 --> 00:46:23.221]  And I'm trying to get off the coffee.
[00:46:24.322 --> 00:46:26.302]  And the cigars and things.
[00:46:26.342 --> 00:46:28.163]  I don't want to fund your system and your taxes.
[00:46:28.963 --> 00:46:33.864]  The point is, is that's why it's such a joke that cops are getting killed raiding drug-infested houses.
[00:46:34.104 --> 00:46:35.324]  Because, yeah, you make it illegal.
[00:46:35.584 --> 00:46:39.385]  Bad people, criminals, are involved in it because you made it illegal because there's money there.
[00:46:39.585 --> 00:46:42.406]  I'm not saying they didn't scum that's out there, you know, drug dealing.
[00:46:43.277 --> 00:46:49.002]  You're getting killed, they're getting killed, but you're also making that money, those kickbacks, those payoffs.
[00:46:49.443 --> 00:46:52.025]  A lot of your detectives are on the dole.
[00:46:52.065 --> 00:46:52.706]  Everybody knows that.
[00:46:52.726 --> 00:46:53.907]  They've been caught millions of times.
[00:46:54.327 --> 00:47:04.076]  They've had, I mean millions of times, they've had several different things where two-thirds plus of the Newark Police Department detectives division has been fired over taking money.
[00:47:05.097 --> 00:47:08.680]  Same thing all over the country, from Boston to Dallas to Houston to you name it.
[00:47:09.281 --> 00:47:13.903]  Money goes into the till, cops find a million bucks, 10,000 gets reported.
[00:47:16.264 --> 00:47:29.271]  It would be hard for me morally to say no, but I would, because I know once you take the step of saying yes, it's over, so please don't become offended that I'm saying that about half your detectives are on the take.
[00:47:30.551 --> 00:47:31.972]  And then it's, then it's,
[00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:33.450]  We're good to go.
[00:48:02.648 --> 00:48:07.831]  When they get you in their government clutches, they put you on average on seven drugs, more than two-thirds of the children.
[00:48:09.132 --> 00:48:10.813]  And adults in institutions, the number's the same.
[00:48:11.693 --> 00:48:14.795]  But then they will SWAT team your house at 3 a.m.
[00:48:14.835 --> 00:48:18.277]  and risk everyone's life looking for marijuana.
[00:48:20.658 --> 00:48:22.219]  I mean, the vice squads make me sick.
[00:48:22.279 --> 00:48:30.144]  A few months ago, we had some idiot informant pull up with a cop next to him, a female cop next to him in the car.
[00:48:31.989 --> 00:48:35.990]  And come up and knock on our business door here and ask you, I want to come in and gamble.
[00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:37.031]  I hear there's a gambling.
[00:48:37.631 --> 00:48:38.791]  And I said, go Google it.
[00:48:38.811 --> 00:48:42.653]  They're probably doing a sting this week in Austin looking for slot machines.
[00:48:42.673 --> 00:48:44.673]  And we Googled it and it wasn't there.
[00:48:44.713 --> 00:48:45.534]  The next day it was.
[00:48:45.574 --> 00:48:47.054]  They'd done raids all over town.
[00:48:47.374 --> 00:48:51.256]  I mean, I don't want cops at my door, you fools.
[00:48:51.696 --> 00:48:54.017]  There's nothing illegal going on in here.
[00:48:54.397 --> 00:48:56.718]  We don't have any stupid slot machines.
[00:48:57.358 --> 00:48:58.318]  And I've got this office.
[00:48:58.338 --> 00:49:00.599]  I've got another little office that's got our servers in it.
[00:49:01.244 --> 00:49:02.425]  And an administrative thing.
[00:49:02.725 --> 00:49:07.469]  And there were two cops over there yesterday when one of my employees pulled up looking in the windows.
[00:49:08.409 --> 00:49:10.451]  I mean, this country is disgusting!
[00:49:11.492 --> 00:49:14.874]  You want to find somebody illegal, how about all these illegal aliens running around?
[00:49:15.474 --> 00:49:21.359]  I saw a van last weekend that was full of children, none of them in seatbelts.
[00:49:21.399 --> 00:49:23.000]  There had to be ten people in that van.
[00:49:24.389 --> 00:49:32.253]  They got a little irritated when I pulled up next to them with the red light, was staring out, and I was about to tell them, put your kids in seatbelts, but I'd be Al-Qaeda if I did, and it was illegal aliens.
[00:49:32.974 --> 00:49:37.236]  Why don't you go pull them over with the ten kids in the van without seatbelts?
[00:49:37.617 --> 00:49:38.737]  No!
[00:49:39.037 --> 00:49:40.878]  That might actually help somebody.
[00:49:41.058 --> 00:49:44.861]  You've been told, I've had Austin cops tell me, they've been told to leave the illegal aliens alone.
[00:49:45.481 --> 00:49:52.305]  No, you're gonna come to my business and ask about slot machines, and then we're gonna catch you looking in my other business.
[00:49:53.504 --> 00:49:54.345]  Leave me alone!
[00:49:56.127 --> 00:49:57.088]  I'm not like you!
[00:49:57.148 --> 00:49:58.529]  I'm not involved in crime!
[00:50:02.913 --> 00:50:07.057]  We pay all the stinking income taxes even though it's a shakedown and goes to foreign banks.
[00:50:07.578 --> 00:50:11.522]  We are above reproach.
[00:50:11.542 --> 00:50:12.863]  And it's not just me.
[00:50:12.903 --> 00:50:14.064]  It's not that I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:14.304 --> 00:50:15.285]  They're at my business.
[00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:16.967]  They were doing it all over the neighborhood.
[00:50:17.868 --> 00:50:18.028]  Here.
[00:50:19.804 --> 00:50:20.964]  They're doing it to everybody.
[00:50:21.024 --> 00:50:24.225]  It's just cops everywhere, spying, citizens spying.
[00:50:24.525 --> 00:50:30.447]  Meanwhile, we got 20% of the population on drugs that can make you go completely psychopathic at the drop of a hat.
[00:50:31.207 --> 00:50:33.347]  Our priorities are screwed up.
[00:50:33.547 --> 00:50:45.250]  There's dead cops everywhere raiding crack houses over drugs that the CIA ships in and has been caught a hundred times red-handed bringing in and laundering all the stinking money.
[00:50:47.271 --> 00:50:48.471]  Meanwhile, I got some
[00:50:50.166 --> 00:50:50.426]  Idiot!
[00:50:52.608 --> 00:50:54.870]  At my door, asking about slot machines.
[00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:56.411]  And trying to look in.
[00:50:57.111 --> 00:51:00.514]  Leave Alex Jones alone!
[00:51:02.175 --> 00:51:03.576]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.596 --> 00:51:05.718]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.418 --> 00:51:10.721]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:10.741 --> 00:51:13.123]  It's known as the Builderbergs.
[00:51:13.383 --> 00:51:16.386]  Isn't their objective being world domination?
[00:51:16.926 --> 00:51:19.348]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:20.092 --> 00:51:27.462]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.453 --> 00:51:35.436]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.896 --> 00:51:39.399]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.759 --> 00:51:42.281]  Bill Burdick is making great progress in order world government.
[00:51:42.321 --> 00:51:43.481]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.501 --> 00:51:44.262]  They're not after money.
[00:51:44.282 --> 00:51:45.342]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.563 --> 00:51:46.323]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.543 --> 00:51:47.664]  That's what they're after, you see.

[00:51:56.029 --> 00:51:58.811]  Endgame, prepped for global enslavement.
[00:51:59.151 --> 00:52:00.412]  You have been warned.
[00:52:02.993 --> 00:52:07.514]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:52:07.855 --> 00:52:11.936]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:52:12.236 --> 00:52:12.797]  We listened.
[00:52:13.097 --> 00:52:18.079]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:52:18.359 --> 00:52:18.839]  We listened.
[00:52:19.219 --> 00:52:22.261]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:52:22.681 --> 00:52:23.222]  We listened.
[00:52:23.682 --> 00:52:27.745]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:52:28.125 --> 00:52:28.605]  We listened.
[00:52:28.946 --> 00:52:34.189]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:35.970]  Again, we listened.
[00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:38.592]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity

[00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:01.878]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[00:53:02.138 --> 00:53:03.819]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[00:53:04.019 --> 00:53:08.041]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[00:53:08.241 --> 00:53:11.283]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[00:53:11.463 --> 00:53:15.285]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[00:53:15.445 --> 00:53:17.826]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[00:53:17.946 --> 00:53:21.208]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices.
[00:53:21.308 --> 00:53:21.568]  I think so.
[00:53:37.039 --> 00:53:37.399]  I think so.
[00:54:03.912 --> 00:54:10.204]  The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a ghost drive
[00:54:15.188 --> 00:54:42.977]  The interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown I live back in the woods, you see A woman and the kids and the dogs and me I got a shotgun, a rifle and a four-wheel drive And a country boy can survive
[00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:55.099]  Not if the National Premises System is able to be put in, or the Animal ID.
[00:54:55.199 --> 00:55:04.069]  Feds all over your property, thousands of dollars fines, one chicken, one goose not registered, federal prison time.
[00:55:05.936 --> 00:55:07.718]  Total regulation, total control.
[00:55:08.218 --> 00:55:11.501]  So you can live like we live here in Austin with just cops, spies everywhere.
[00:55:11.821 --> 00:55:15.645]  Looking in your windows, asking questions, just cold calling up the doors.
[00:55:16.305 --> 00:55:20.429]  Just like they're doing knock and talk from Dallas to New York to Boston.
[00:55:20.669 --> 00:55:22.450]  Hey, let us in to look for illegal guns.
[00:55:22.931 --> 00:55:24.933]  We don't have warrants, but you better just let us in.
[00:55:24.973 --> 00:55:26.294]  We're just here going door to door.
[00:55:26.434 --> 00:55:27.034]  It's freedom.
[00:55:27.054 --> 00:55:29.777]  Oh yeah, it's just wonderful.
[00:55:29.997 --> 00:55:30.938]  It's just, it's all wonderful.
[00:55:32.523 --> 00:55:33.963]  Okay, let's go to John in Michigan.
[00:55:33.983 --> 00:55:34.684]  John, thanks for holding.
[00:55:34.704 --> 00:55:36.664]  We'll go to Johnny, Bobby, Cory, and others.
[00:55:36.684 --> 00:55:37.224]  Go ahead, John.
[00:55:38.384 --> 00:55:39.945]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:55:40.065 --> 00:55:41.285]  I'm right on board with you.
[00:55:41.405 --> 00:55:42.525]  Keep going at it like that.
[00:55:43.446 --> 00:55:47.787]  You did send me a couple DVDs on the Michael Moore.
[00:55:49.287 --> 00:55:50.367]  Your phone's real bad.
[00:55:50.407 --> 00:55:51.288]  Your phone's real bad.
[00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:53.768]  Okay, well, I'm trying to get closer, okay?
[00:55:53.928 --> 00:55:54.168]  Yeah.
[00:55:54.228 --> 00:55:55.169]  I'm on a cell phone.
[00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:57.909]  I talked to you about Michael Moore.
[00:55:58.089 --> 00:55:58.349]  Yes.
[00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:00.110]  Last weekend.
[00:56:01.853 --> 00:56:13.519]  Uh, DVD, uh, the, uh, Endgame, Terror Storm, your, uh, C-A-F-R, the C.A.F.F.E.R., um, the thing on, uh... Yeah, I'm on the... Yeah, so I mailed you some DVDs to give to Michael Moore.
[00:56:13.599 --> 00:56:13.859]  Yes.
[00:56:14.119 --> 00:56:17.221]  Yes, and I got them to him yesterday, so... Oh, thank you!
[00:56:17.721 --> 00:56:19.142]  That's taken care of.
[00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:22.784]  I also, um, my sister has a DVD on vaccines.
[00:56:22.804 --> 00:56:24.605]  She's been researching it for 35 years.
[00:56:25.265 --> 00:56:26.445]  May I give us her website?
[00:56:26.746 --> 00:56:27.306]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:56:28.064 --> 00:56:30.124]  It's ChildhoodShots.com.
[00:56:30.344 --> 00:56:35.345]  That's ChildhoodShots.com, and it's a magazine that I'll send to you.
[00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:38.826]  It's indexed so that it's easy to follow.
[00:56:39.286 --> 00:56:41.327]  And one other thing, I brought up Ted Nugent.
[00:56:41.367 --> 00:56:45.987]  The reason I did that, Alex, he is on the board of the NRA.
[00:56:46.648 --> 00:56:53.749]  And the only reason I would want you on there is to confront him about his position there and why he isn't exposing things.
[00:56:54.662 --> 00:57:03.364]  He's this big gun promoter of guns, but yet he's on a board of a group that's trying to get rid of our guns.
[00:57:03.404 --> 00:57:03.885]  That's right.
[00:57:03.905 --> 00:57:05.345]  I appreciate your call.
[00:57:05.365 --> 00:57:11.747]  And for those that just joined us, let me just add, the NRA has actually sponsored all the big gun control bills.
[00:57:12.207 --> 00:57:13.467]  And gun owners don't know that.
[00:57:13.867 --> 00:57:15.728]  It's actually a gun control group.
[00:57:15.888 --> 00:57:16.128]  I know.
[00:57:16.168 --> 00:57:17.048]  You don't believe me?
[00:57:18.608 --> 00:57:20.329]  I and others convinced Gunners of America
[00:57:22.088 --> 00:57:28.272]  The second largest organization in the country, gun organization, to go public on that.
[00:57:30.173 --> 00:57:31.974]  And to expose that.
[00:57:33.155 --> 00:57:34.636]  And that has now happened.
[00:57:35.837 --> 00:57:42.841]  And so they put out reports documenting the federal cases, documenting how they supported the 68 gun control act, actually offered it and pushed it.
[00:57:43.962 --> 00:57:50.406]  The Brady Bill in the mid-90s, the NICS program in 2000, they've been behind it all.
[00:57:50.426 --> 00:58:12.957]  They're now supporting the bill that would ban, and it's passed the House, it's in the Senate, that would ban anyone with post-traumatic stress disorder or ADHD from the military, police, and tens of millions have this, it's made up of course, or that is, they exaggerate it, and say you won't be able to own guns.
[00:58:14.378 --> 00:58:15.499]  And it's a big deal.
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.061]  They're supporting that.
[00:58:18.382 --> 00:58:20.224]  And you try to explain it to people who are just not aware of it.
[00:58:20.244 --> 00:58:23.207]  That's why you need to go to GunOwners.org and read their letter about that.
[00:58:23.267 --> 00:58:24.288]  GunOwners.org.
[00:58:24.949 --> 00:58:27.331]  Or join Gun Owners of America now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:27.772 --> 00:58:29.554]  Get involved with Gun Owners of America.
[00:58:29.594 --> 00:58:29.974]  Don't wait.
[00:58:30.455 --> 00:58:32.357]  The Second Amendment's under greater attack now than ever.
[00:58:32.377 --> 00:58:34.879]  Okay, I'll try to get to Johnny, Bobby, Cory, and others.
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.001]  And Jason Burmess is coming up in about ten minutes.
[00:58:37.021 --> 00:58:37.402]  Stay with us.
[00:58:43.251 --> 00:58:45.372]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.872 --> 00:58:49.213]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.855 --> 00:58:58.555]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.156 --> 00:59:00.296]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.936 --> 00:59:02.277]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.697 --> 00:59:03.497]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.264 --> 00:59:05.184]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.204 --> 00:59:09.506]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.007 --> 00:59:15.869]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.009 --> 00:59:18.950]  We are now into hour number two.
[00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:21.011]  We're going to jam in some more of your calls right now.
[00:59:21.852 --> 00:59:24.233]  Jason Burma's coming on to talk about Luce Shane's final cut.
[00:59:24.253 --> 00:59:27.174]  He'll be playing some audio clips from the film.
[00:59:28.485 --> 00:59:32.766]  I'm only discussing a lot of the breaking 9-11 information in this documentary.
[00:59:33.206 --> 00:59:35.907]  Johnny in Vancouver, Canada, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:59:36.347 --> 00:59:37.207]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:37.627]  Good.
[00:59:39.007 --> 00:59:51.290]  Being awake, I guess the best thing about being aware of what's going on is being able to decipher things that you hear on TV that, you know, before you might have not picked up.
[00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:55.691]  For instance, yesterday, something that I find very odd and just maybe coincidental,
[00:59:56.329 --> 01:00:09.740]  Is that hours before the shooting in Nebraska, it seems that the president was there and he was giving a speech to the One World Community Health Center and he was talking about mental health issues.
[01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:12.563]  He leaves, the shooting happens.
[01:00:12.583 --> 01:00:15.946]  I don't know if it's connected, but it's very odd, in my opinion.
[01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:24.413]  Nah, they just had a thirty-something million dollar over the decades mind control program and, you know, the former head of
[01:00:25.777 --> 01:00:33.942]  The CIA Mind Control Program, MKUltra, was McVeigh's doctor from the time he went to Denver to the time he went to Terre Haute and was executed.
[01:00:34.522 --> 01:00:40.786]  Dr. Jolion West, I mean, congressional hearings, just a former top mind control doctor, was with him continually.
[01:00:41.667 --> 01:00:44.308]  Look, sir, okay, it doesn't exist.
[01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:44.949]  Everything's fine.
[01:00:45.749 --> 01:00:49.572]  And my other thing was, what do you think we did?
[01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:53.114]  We're in Chapter's bookstore on Tuesday night.
[01:00:53.938 --> 01:00:58.181]  confronting the Prime Minister of Canada, John Cochrane.
[01:00:58.341 --> 01:00:59.962]  I did see that video, so that's you.
[01:00:59.982 --> 01:01:03.084]  I mean, everywhere politicians go, they get confronted about 9-11.
[01:01:03.184 --> 01:01:05.706]  The video's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:06.206 --> 01:01:07.627]  All I can say is, I salute you.
[01:01:08.107 --> 01:01:09.028]  It was about five of us.
[01:01:09.648 --> 01:01:10.909]  What do you think our next step should be?
[01:01:10.929 --> 01:01:21.916]  Do you think we should coordinate something with Toronto and Montreal, where he's supposed to be, and basically do the same thing and, you know, like, say, did you watch the video?
[01:01:22.497 --> 01:01:23.137]  What's your comment?
[01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:25.837]  Because he didn't know that he was being filmed at the time.
[01:01:26.963 --> 01:01:38.785]  Yeah, you give him the loose change video, or one of you does, and you talk about how the Italian former president's gone public saying it's an inside job, and then he says, oh, is this the video that woke him up?
[01:01:39.465 --> 01:01:44.066]  And yeah, following it up will have an effect on him to certainly watch the film.
[01:01:44.646 --> 01:01:46.667]  Everywhere he goes, people bring this back up to him.
[01:01:46.907 --> 01:01:53.368]  Well, it's already been put out on the web where he's going to be next, so I bet my bottom dollar that folks are going to go talk to him there as well.
[01:01:54.875 --> 01:02:04.862]  And about the article in the Italian paper, I'm able to read the language myself and what exactly you guys are talking about exactly what he's saying.
[01:02:05.442 --> 01:02:12.106]  And he is known in Italy for being someone who does resurface old issues.
[01:02:12.847 --> 01:02:23.654]  And don't be surprised if he does talk about his involvement with Gladio because I guess when you get old, you get a little bit of a conscience and you know, you maybe feel bad for what you've done.
[01:02:24.483 --> 01:02:30.865]  And it seems like he's either doing that or there might be some other motive that's unclear.
[01:02:32.265 --> 01:02:37.067]  Well, he's a highly respected Italian president, one of the longest serving in their history.
[01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:45.930]  I mean, the Italian president, this is not the president of Timbuktu or something, or New Guinea.
[01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:49.911]  This is the president of Italy coming out and saying it's a total inside job and everybody knows it.
[01:02:50.757 --> 01:02:55.061]  I was watching Sky TV in Italy yesterday, and they are not talking about it at all.
[01:02:55.701 --> 01:02:56.822]  Sky TV is owned by Fox.
[01:02:57.283 --> 01:03:06.211]  So the muzzle has been put on this story, and it won't come out unless... I mean, it's hard to dig something that's not in English language.
[01:03:08.052 --> 01:03:16.440]  Well, it is hard to get it out, but we got it translated, and people didn't believe us, and a bunch of other big sites did translate it, and it does say that, and that's the end of it.
[01:03:17.465 --> 01:03:21.829]  Uh, the story's in the News and Focus section on the right hand side of PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:03:21.869 --> 01:03:22.550]  Thank you for the call.
[01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:25.432]  You know, we're already an hour plus into this transmission.
[01:03:25.532 --> 01:03:26.653]  Uh, Christmas is almost here.
[01:03:27.333 --> 01:03:30.656]  You need to give the gift of truth this holiday season, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:31.357 --> 01:03:34.059]  And you need to think about getting in-game and loose change final cut.
[01:03:34.579 --> 01:03:36.821]  And, I mean, that is the perfect gift for people.
[01:03:37.402 --> 01:03:39.263]  And you don't have to fight the crowds or any of that.
[01:03:39.824 --> 01:03:42.006]  You can also support us and wake other people up.
[01:03:42.306 --> 01:03:43.447]  It's a win-win-win-win.
[01:03:43.767 --> 01:03:45.869]  Go to InfoWars.com and get in-game.
[01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:55.397]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:55.417 --> 01:03:57.537]  A new world order.
[01:03:58.237 --> 01:04:02.499]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:04.900]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.201]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:11.182]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:11.922 --> 01:04:19.265]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:22.253 --> 01:04:27.256]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:27.717 --> 01:04:31.219]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:31.579 --> 01:04:33.681]  Bill of Rights makes progress for the world.
[01:04:34.141 --> 01:04:35.122]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:35.142 --> 01:04:36.062]  They're not after money.
[01:04:36.082 --> 01:04:37.163]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.383 --> 01:04:38.124]  They're after power.
[01:04:38.344 --> 01:04:39.224]  That's what they're after.
[01:04:39.525 --> 01:04:47.710]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:50.692]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:04:51.052 --> 01:04:52.093]  You have been warned.

[01:05:30.836 --> 01:05:31.497]  I think so.
[01:05:52.742 --> 01:05:54.403]  You wear a seatbelt in your car.
[01:05:54.663 --> 01:05:55.963]  At home, you lock the doors.
[01:05:56.243 --> 01:05:57.964]  How about when you use your cell phone?
[01:05:58.164 --> 01:05:59.324]  How do you protect yourself?
[01:05:59.624 --> 01:06:05.266]  EMFs, or electromagnetic frequencies, act like an invisible pollution that surrounds us every day.
[01:06:05.487 --> 01:06:12.449]  Studies link EMFs to many ailments, from stress to depression, anxiety, decreased mental performance, lower immune
[01:06:12.449 --> 01:06:12.849]  We're good to go!
[01:06:32.396 --> 01:06:38.699]  Installing the BioPro cell phone chip utilizes patented noise field technology to block harmful EMF pollution.
[01:06:38.939 --> 01:06:39.799]  Still not convinced?
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:45.882]  Go to ElectroPollution.org right now to purchase the extremely affordable BioPro cell chip.

[01:06:58.186 --> 01:06:58.866]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.507 --> 01:07:00.627]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:02.388]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.028 --> 01:07:03.869]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:05.509]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:10.111]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.351 --> 01:07:14.493]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.914 --> 01:07:26.819]  Robert Baer is not allowed to write books under national security agreements about his exploits as a
[01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:31.495]  Vaunted field commander in the CIA.
[01:07:33.235 --> 01:07:34.736]  So he fictionalizes them.
[01:07:35.656 --> 01:07:45.418]  He has a new book out about a fictional account of a CIA agent finding out about a government-sponsored terror attack on the World Trade Center.
[01:07:47.099 --> 01:07:51.860]  Of course, he wrote the book that Siriana the movie was made out of and later admitted that it's really a true story.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.580]  That's what the names changed.
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:57.101]  So, he has a new book out.
[01:07:57.817 --> 01:08:01.619]  about the government staging 9-11, but it's fiction.
[01:08:01.859 --> 01:08:03.039]  Of course it is.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:12.043]  But he's joining us in about an hour and a half from now, or a little less, but here's a clip from him on Tom Hartman's radio show being asked about 9-11.
[01:08:13.644 --> 01:08:15.545]  So are you just, you know,
[01:08:16.286 --> 01:08:17.407]  Personally of the opinion.
[01:08:17.447 --> 01:08:27.455]  I mean, obviously you can't speak for the CIA or your previous activities with the agency, but are you of the opinion that there was an aspect of inside jobs in 9-11 within the U.S.
[01:08:27.475 --> 01:08:27.795]  government?
[01:08:28.836 --> 01:08:30.017]  There's that possibility.
[01:08:30.037 --> 01:08:31.278]  The evidence points at it.
[01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:33.940]  And why is it not being investigated?
[01:08:35.781 --> 01:08:38.604]  Why isn't the WMD story being investigated?
[01:08:38.804 --> 01:08:42.066]  Why hasn't anybody been held accountable for 9-11?
[01:08:43.715 --> 01:08:46.436]  I mean, we held people accountable after Pearl Harbor.
[01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:50.278]  I mean, you know, why has there been no change of command?
[01:08:50.358 --> 01:08:52.519]  Why has there been no political repercussions?
[01:08:53.139 --> 01:08:59.262]  Why has there been no... any sort of exposure on this?
[01:08:59.722 --> 01:09:00.863]  It really makes you wonder.
[01:09:02.483 --> 01:09:06.665]  So, Robert Baer, coming up, that should be interesting, and Burmese has come up in a little while.
[01:09:07.006 --> 01:09:10.947]  Let's go ahead and go to Bobby, then Corey, Rob, Reno, and others.
[01:09:11.027 --> 01:09:12.428]  Bobby, you're on the air from California.
[01:09:13.061 --> 01:09:14.061]  Hi, Alex.
[01:09:14.182 --> 01:09:27.708]  If you YouTube hidden cell phone towers, you'll find a nice five minute CBS clip talking about how beautiful the new hidden cell phone towers are that are hidden in light poles, cactuses, fake trees, church steeples, light poles.
[01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:31.109]  Because it upsets us.
[01:09:31.809 --> 01:09:35.491]  We falsely believe it isn't good for us if it's right above our building.
[01:09:35.951 --> 01:09:40.734]  So now we're not so scared and no one complains if it's a fake tree on the playground.
[01:09:40.754 --> 01:09:40.834]  Yeah.
[01:09:43.428 --> 01:09:44.809]  It's good for you, sir.
[01:09:44.869 --> 01:09:45.749]  They love you.
[01:09:46.509 --> 01:09:48.150]  They're good people running things.
[01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:48.890]  Not bad.
[01:09:49.431 --> 01:09:50.011]  Good!
[01:09:51.291 --> 01:09:52.632]  Government's good.
[01:09:52.732 --> 01:09:53.512]  It loves you.
[01:09:53.792 --> 01:09:55.013]  It's loving.
[01:09:57.014 --> 01:09:57.774]  Anything else, Bobby?
[01:09:57.794 --> 01:09:59.435]  Uh, yes.
[01:09:59.635 --> 01:10:11.620]  As far as what the future holds, if everybody spreads 9-11, Ron Paul, and the Federal Reserve Truth like a mother spreading flyers who lost her child, then the future's gonna look good.
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:12.340]  We'll have freedom.
[01:10:13.228 --> 01:10:18.131]  But we have lost our freedom, we are going into great tyranny, and we should act like a mother who's lost her child.
[01:10:18.831 --> 01:10:24.575]  We should be running around hysterically, looking, and warning, and waking people up.
[01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:29.057]  Thank you for the call, I appreciate it, sir.
[01:10:29.798 --> 01:10:31.819]  Uh, Cory in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:10:31.839 --> 01:10:33.560]  Oh, are you there?
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:34.440]  Yes, sir!
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:36.782]  Alright, sorry, my phone messed up.
[01:10:36.822 --> 01:10:42.405]  Okay, um, I have a couple questions for you, but um, I just wanted to make a comment about your rant on the
[01:10:43.223 --> 01:10:44.223]  Drugs situation.
[01:10:44.243 --> 01:10:48.124]  I had a secondhand experience with my brother actually, which was kind of weird.
[01:10:48.144 --> 01:10:49.064]  I want to share that with you.
[01:10:49.705 --> 01:10:52.665]  Um, he was about eight years old at the time.
[01:10:52.685 --> 01:10:59.707]  They had put him on antidepressants because he had a sleeping problem, which I don't know how they come to that conclusion, but they give it to you, sir.
[01:10:59.907 --> 01:11:03.448]  When you have your wisdom teeth pulled now, go ahead.
[01:11:03.748 --> 01:11:04.368]  I'm not kidding.
[01:11:04.388 --> 01:11:05.909]  Oh, I know.
[01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:10.710]  And, uh, you know, he is about eight years old and after about a month of taking the medication,
[01:11:11.643 --> 01:11:21.332]  Um, a bird had died that we had and he laughed about it, uh, pretty crazy and then he tried to slit my throat while I was sleeping and they had to put him on, uh, an anger management for like four years.
[01:11:21.772 --> 01:11:23.214]  And more drugs, and more drugs.
[01:11:23.234 --> 01:11:28.598]  Yeah, of course, and he's also a fan of yours, I just wanted to, you know, tell you that.
[01:11:28.738 --> 01:11:30.340]  So he's awake now and knows what they did to him?
[01:11:31.016 --> 01:11:32.256]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[01:11:32.296 --> 01:11:33.877]  He's defeated the enemy.
[01:11:34.277 --> 01:11:45.359]  And he defeats the enemy, as the French say, the best revenge is living well, being strong, getting in shape, never getting in their filth bag system, never letting them get their hands on him.
[01:11:45.939 --> 01:11:46.319]  Go ahead.
[01:11:46.359 --> 01:11:48.599]  Yeah, and I'm glad for him for that.
[01:11:48.659 --> 01:11:50.379]  I have another question.
[01:11:50.399 --> 01:11:54.320]  I just want to ask you, you know what your take is on the chemtrails?
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:56.501]  I don't know if you've been following that lately.
[01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:57.681]  Those are vitamin trails.
[01:11:57.701 --> 01:11:58.921]  They're putting vitamins in the air.
[01:11:59.762 --> 01:12:01.364]  Okay, well that's a good thing then, right?
[01:12:01.444 --> 01:12:02.284]  No, I'm just kidding.
[01:12:02.945 --> 01:12:07.409]  No, because there's an outbreak here of something they call a staph infection.
[01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:09.371]  It's good for you, sir.
[01:12:09.631 --> 01:12:12.774]  No, it's... No, check this out.
[01:12:12.794 --> 01:12:17.558]  There's like, there's approximately like 20, about 20 chemtrails each day we see over our area.
[01:12:17.638 --> 01:12:19.580]  Flesh-eating bacteria, sir, are good.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.082]  Yeah, no, no.
[01:12:22.182 --> 01:12:23.924]  You're not without... No, hold on.
[01:12:23.984 --> 01:12:25.325]  Actually, they don't exist.
[01:12:25.345 --> 01:12:26.006]  How about that?
[01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:28.472]  Okay, yeah, I mean, I'm looking at them right now.
[01:12:28.532 --> 01:12:29.352]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:12:29.933 --> 01:12:30.493]  I know what you're saying.
[01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:31.574]  Yeah, I don't see anything.
[01:12:31.614 --> 01:12:33.456]  North American Union doesn't exist, okay?
[01:12:34.157 --> 01:12:36.679]  No, and yeah, I want to ask you about that, too.
[01:12:36.699 --> 01:12:37.119]  I'm sorry.
[01:12:37.139 --> 01:12:38.400]  I don't want to take up too much of your time.
[01:12:38.461 --> 01:12:39.481]  Hey, take up all the time you want.
[01:12:39.501 --> 01:12:40.082]  You want to talk.
[01:12:40.382 --> 01:12:41.143]  Hey, hey, listen.
[01:12:41.263 --> 01:12:41.984]  Let me get serious.
[01:12:42.844 --> 01:12:43.045]  Okay.
[01:12:43.065 --> 01:12:47.789]  You got a lot of kooks that think every condensation trail or ice crystal trail is spray.
[01:12:48.567 --> 01:12:51.150]  Well, I'm being serious now.
[01:12:52.231 --> 01:13:01.601]  But then, and they make us all look bad, but then there are declassified tens of thousands of examples of chemical, biological, radiological spraying.
[01:13:01.641 --> 01:13:05.505]  They're also doing atmosphere manipulation that's now been declassified.
[01:13:06.835 --> 01:13:09.555]  We reported with the father of weather weapons two years ago.
[01:13:09.575 --> 01:13:11.556]  Right when it was declassified, he would come on air.
[01:13:12.796 --> 01:13:20.157]  Now they're announcing MIT just invented all the stuff that was certified by Stanford Research Institute and the Naval Weapons Laboratory in 1967.
[01:13:20.377 --> 01:13:24.118]  They can control, create, or knock out hurricanes.
[01:13:24.518 --> 01:13:26.398]  He's the guy that flooded the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[01:13:26.858 --> 01:13:29.939]  So see, everything they tell you about now has been around for decades.
[01:13:29.959 --> 01:13:35.480]  And yes, there's all sorts of covert programs going on from the loving eugenicists that run our society.
[01:13:36.195 --> 01:13:37.355]  Yeah, here's the kicker.
[01:13:37.375 --> 01:13:39.756]  Like, I went to the hospital and they told me it was a spider bite.
[01:13:40.336 --> 01:13:45.098]  But anyways, you know, I want to get on to some other things before, you know, whatever.
[01:13:45.118 --> 01:13:48.098]  But I also saw a program on TV the other day.
[01:13:48.218 --> 01:13:48.819]  You know, it's scary.
[01:13:48.839 --> 01:13:51.059]  I want to see how people can watch it and not be scared.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:58.061]  They were talking about how they can use a computer program to, you know, analyze your brainwaves.
[01:13:58.201 --> 01:14:04.203]  And I saw this guy use an actual Microsoft Paint program with, you know, with cords attached to his brain.
[01:14:04.642 --> 01:14:14.386]  And they actually had the goal to actually say that they planned on making exoskeletons, which would be able to give people superhuman strength.
[01:14:14.806 --> 01:14:20.028]  Enough strength to pick up a two-ton car and throw it, you know, with this type of technology.
[01:14:20.068 --> 01:14:21.909]  Yeah, the military's developing that.
[01:14:23.029 --> 01:14:24.150]  Oh, that's great.
[01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:24.930]  That's good to know.
[01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:31.553]  And another thing, this is another thing I want to ask you.
[01:14:31.793 --> 01:14:33.154]  I research you on YouTube a lot.
[01:14:33.174 --> 01:14:34.254]  I look at a lot of your videos.
[01:14:35.744 --> 01:14:48.133]  I saw a guy who was accusing you of being part of some kind of project Mockingbird for the CIA, and I wanted to get your opinion on that, because he took a lot of weak shots at you.
[01:14:48.293 --> 01:14:50.575]  I mean, it's not true, and I don't care.
[01:14:50.595 --> 01:15:04.106]  I mean, if I spent all my time, and listen, I appreciate your call, if I spent all my time talking about me, and talking about what people say about me, listen, for the sake of debate,
[01:15:04.762 --> 01:15:08.844]  And again, I'm not involved with the CIA, I'm not in Operation Mockingbird.
[01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:12.585]  That's the name of an old program that we use as a blanket term.
[01:15:13.865 --> 01:15:17.187]  Let's just, for the sake of argument, let's just say I am.
[01:15:17.447 --> 01:15:29.151]  In fact, let's say I'm a Reptoid, I'm a Scientologist, I'm a Nazi, I'm a Catholic, a Jesuit, I am all these things.
[01:15:29.611 --> 01:15:30.272]  Let me think what else.
[01:15:32.375 --> 01:15:33.276]  What else do they say?
[01:15:33.316 --> 01:15:35.717]  There's one website saying I'm an owl alien.
[01:15:36.697 --> 01:15:38.018]  Let's just say that's all true.
[01:15:38.038 --> 01:15:38.799]  Okay?
[01:15:39.879 --> 01:15:40.279]  It's not.
[01:15:40.479 --> 01:15:41.800]  But let's just say it is true.
[01:15:43.321 --> 01:15:44.321]  It doesn't matter.
[01:15:44.662 --> 01:15:46.903]  What are you going to do about the North American Union?
[01:15:47.023 --> 01:15:51.325]  What are you going to do about mercury and vaccines, which they haven't taken out, as Dr. David L. Lysen says they have?
[01:15:52.006 --> 01:15:54.407]  What are you going to do about the police state?
[01:15:54.487 --> 01:15:55.868]  What are you going to do about the wars?
[01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:57.649]  What are you going to do about the devaluing dollar?
[01:15:58.069 --> 01:16:01.811]  What are you going to do to get Ron Paul elected, or at least try?
[01:16:03.101 --> 01:16:10.286]  Half of our movement spends most of its time, I'd say about half, ninnying about, is this person good?
[01:16:10.346 --> 01:16:11.107]  Is that person good?
[01:16:11.127 --> 01:16:11.747]  Is this person good?
[01:16:11.787 --> 01:16:12.488]  Is that person bad?
[01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:14.389]  It doesn't matter.
[01:16:14.969 --> 01:16:16.491]  You know you're good.
[01:16:17.191 --> 01:16:20.713]  You know that you have power and can affect change in your area.
[01:16:21.154 --> 01:16:23.435]  You know you can go help people at soup kitchens.
[01:16:23.916 --> 01:16:27.258]  You know you can go fight phony environmentalists stealing people's private property.
[01:16:27.638 --> 01:16:29.960]  You know you can go educate people about the Second Amendment.
[01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:32.851]  You know you can educate people about our monetary system.
[01:16:32.891 --> 01:16:44.653]  See, a government agent would go around saying everybody else's agents, everybody else can't be trusted, we don't have any power, everything's screwed up.
[01:16:45.633 --> 01:16:46.974]  No, I'm telling you the opposite.
[01:16:47.654 --> 01:16:52.535]  I'm telling you what Gandhi said, that you have power, you have the seed of the universe in each and every one of you.
[01:16:53.195 --> 01:16:53.495]  Okay?
[01:16:54.139 --> 01:16:57.142]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[01:16:57.783 --> 01:16:59.925]  I'm saying take action.
[01:17:00.105 --> 01:17:02.708]  You know that you are good.
[01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:05.792]  And I would just tell you stay on issues.
[01:17:05.932 --> 01:17:09.636]  Stay on issues so that we can go out and wake other people up.
[01:17:09.696 --> 01:17:10.697]  I mean, that's the goal.
[01:17:10.717 --> 01:17:13.540]  I mean, can you imagine
[01:17:15.507 --> 01:17:34.563]  The average listener or a new listener driving along in a car and they listen to the few little Patriot talk shows that are out there, and half the time they're talking about weird shop talk or what mentally ill people or schizophrenics or people that ask to grind or government agents who runs the gamut are out saying and doing.
[01:17:35.303 --> 01:17:38.386]  Anybody who takes action and speaks up is going to be attacked.
[01:17:38.766 --> 01:17:43.330]  And you're going to be attacked by the government, you're going to be attacked by the media, I say anybody who does it in a big way.
[01:17:44.196 --> 01:17:47.599]  You're going to be attacked by people who take a shot at your success.
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.601]  It's called your success taking a shot at you.
[01:17:51.882 --> 01:17:53.744]  And I mean, I expect that.
[01:17:53.844 --> 01:17:54.484]  I like that.
[01:17:57.607 --> 01:17:58.388]  It's kind of sick.
[01:17:58.888 --> 01:18:00.649]  And I've tried to get to where I don't enjoy it.
[01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:04.613]  But quite frankly, me and Paul Watson have similar tastes.
[01:18:05.774 --> 01:18:09.236]  It's enjoyment time, late at night for Paul and late at night for me.
[01:18:09.276 --> 01:18:12.459]  And he'll send me little IMs about enjoyments he's found.
[01:18:12.939 --> 01:18:13.540]  And it's sick.
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:14.960]  It's sick.
[01:18:15.841 --> 01:18:25.366]  And I've got to stop it, because I probably spend 20 minutes a day... I wish there was more attacks, because... I mean, folks, when there's people with videos saying I'm a Reptoid, I mean, it's funny.
[01:18:26.007 --> 01:18:28.048]  I probably watch those videos like 15 times apiece.
[01:18:28.108 --> 01:18:32.090]  I mean, I... But then I realize it's a sign of a larger sickness, and it's not funny.
[01:18:33.191 --> 01:18:40.875]  Or when people Photoshop my head onto the body of a Catholic priest, and say I'm a Catholic agent, when I'm not even Catholic.
[01:18:41.196 --> 01:18:41.916]  I mean, that's funny.
[01:18:43.031 --> 01:18:44.393]  But, it's not funny.
[01:18:45.436 --> 01:18:50.947]  And, uh, so... I mean, our biggest, the person we really like is Gordon Bloyer.
[01:18:51.027 --> 01:18:52.030]  I mean, we're big fans.
[01:18:54.073 --> 01:19:00.279]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:19:00.739 --> 01:19:08.526]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:19:08.867 --> 01:19:16.714]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:19:17.014 --> 01:19:21.775]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:19:22.115 --> 01:19:26.836]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:19:27.336 --> 01:19:31.197]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:19:31.677 --> 01:19:32.697]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:32.757 --> 01:19:36.838]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:19:37.278 --> 01:19:41.659]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:19:42.179 --> 01:19:44.680]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.762]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.

[01:19:50.824 --> 01:19:58.409]  As the old saying goes, if you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.
[01:19:58.589 --> 01:20:04.112]  But if you give him a Berkey system, you give him the ability to obtain purified water for a lifetime.
[01:20:04.413 --> 01:20:09.496]  This year, when giving Christmas gifts, instead of unwanted trinkets, give a meaningful and substantial gift.

[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:29.783]  Perfect for anyone on a tight budget, and more importantly, if there's an unexpected emergency, your loved ones will be prepared.
[01:20:29.803 --> 01:20:33.924]  That's because Perky systems are able to purify raw, untreated water.

[01:20:58.059 --> 01:21:02.644]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:05.647]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:21:06.168 --> 01:21:12.855]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.

[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:24.443]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:21:25.003 --> 01:21:28.345]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.

[01:23:12.037 --> 01:23:20.064]  No, no, it's definitely sick that I laugh and get off on people attacking me and making up things.
[01:23:21.745 --> 01:23:27.990]  But then sometimes I really morally think about it and I go, no, this is actually bad.
[01:23:30.352 --> 01:23:36.036]  And, you know, I'm a person that is upright and moral and look at the fruits of what I've done.
[01:23:36.677 --> 01:23:39.119]  Most people that attack me, I actually woke them up.
[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:41.561]  They'll even admit that.
[01:23:42.637 --> 01:24:03.358]  And that's what's crazy about it is, I don't know how to judge that fruit, I'm waking up millions of people with your help, and then the very people that I've woken up, and it's almost universally people I've woken up, will then go out and lie about me and say I'm bad and make up all this ridiculous stuff, and then, does that mean I'm doing a good job?
[01:24:03.458 --> 01:24:05.240]  That I've created all these creatures?
[01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:11.253]  But I think they were already unstable to begin with, and they just got into the movement and couldn't stay focused on issues.
[01:24:11.793 --> 01:24:25.000]  I'm encouraging all of you, politically, psychologically, spiritually, to pick issues that you research, that you think are important, and be issues-oriented, and try to keep your eye on the ball and take action.
[01:24:26.281 --> 01:24:30.744]  We need every able-bodied man, woman, and child in this country to fight the info war.
[01:24:31.184 --> 01:24:32.805]  And fight it however you see fit.
[01:24:32.905 --> 01:24:34.846]  See, I'm not here saying I'm your leader or telling you
[01:24:36.129 --> 01:24:37.590]  What specifically to go out and do?
[01:24:39.210 --> 01:24:46.453]  I'm asking you to use your own brains and to not listen to orders from headquarters, but to go to the sound of the guns.
[01:24:47.494 --> 01:24:48.194]  To take action.
[01:24:49.935 --> 01:24:53.336]  And to realize that you're not going to fix everything overnight.
[01:24:53.396 --> 01:24:54.277]  It's a process.
[01:24:56.938 --> 01:24:59.179]  Well, we've got Rob, Reno, Dave, Charles.
[01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:00.539]  Let's go to Charles, Louisiana.
[01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:01.680]  Charles, how you doing?
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:05.041]  How are you doing, sir?
[01:25:05.061 --> 01:25:05.141]  Good!
[01:25:05.662 --> 01:25:07.063]  Listen, I wanted to say something.
[01:25:07.083 --> 01:25:08.184]  I've been calling you for years.
[01:25:08.624 --> 01:25:10.786]  You see these people that ask you this question?
[01:25:11.386 --> 01:25:17.611]  That's people that you give the facts out, and they can check your facts, but these people are too lazy to check the facts.
[01:25:18.612 --> 01:25:26.839]  That's why if you make a mistake, they want to condemn you, and to think about it, they have to condemn you because they don't do nothing about their life or this country.
[01:25:27.179 --> 01:25:28.861]  That's why they try to put you on the spot.
[01:25:30.555 --> 01:25:41.746]  Yeah, I think a lot of it is subconsciously that a lot of people find out about the New World Order and it's so threatening, it's kind of mean... You have to make it, kill a messenger, and you won't hear it no more.
[01:25:42.714 --> 01:25:43.515]  You know what I mean?
[01:25:43.535 --> 01:25:44.335]  Well, I know this.
[01:25:44.956 --> 01:25:47.418]  People are going to grow up when the big depression hits.
[01:25:47.458 --> 01:25:50.461]  They're going to grow up when things get a lot worse than they are now.
[01:25:50.801 --> 01:25:57.767]  And I'm just trying to grow our numbers as fast as we can, so that as we go into the dark night, we've got a bigger army to fight the New World Order.
[01:25:58.088 --> 01:26:00.810]  I mean, the sun's setting, the enemy's coming over the hill to attack us.
[01:26:01.130 --> 01:26:02.291]  I'm trying to rally people.
[01:26:02.331 --> 01:26:03.072]  Hey, there's a threat!
[01:26:03.112 --> 01:26:03.773]  There's an enemy!
[01:26:04.133 --> 01:26:04.693]  Wake up!
[01:26:05.074 --> 01:26:05.935]  You have power!
[01:26:05.995 --> 01:26:07.036]  You can affect change!
[01:26:07.316 --> 01:26:09.718]  That is the last message the New World Order wants out.
[01:26:10.018 --> 01:26:15.999]  Well, it's the same way if you heard it, somebody else told you, and you don't want to do nothing about it, you have to attack the messenger.
[01:26:16.239 --> 01:26:18.440]  But it makes me mad when people do this.
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.240]  I've been with you about eight years now.
[01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:21.600]  Eight years.
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.821]  I think you've been listening longer than eight years.
[01:26:23.901 --> 01:26:26.521]  I mean, you were calling in like a 99, 98, weren't you?
[01:26:26.741 --> 01:26:28.662]  Yeah, 99, when I got your first tape in 99, yeah.
[01:26:29.502 --> 01:26:32.423]  And I'm just, these people, they don't do nothing.
[01:26:32.443 --> 01:26:33.243]  They might listen.
[01:26:33.683 --> 01:26:34.763]  Bench warmers, I call them.
[01:26:35.370 --> 01:26:37.972]  But here's the thing, we're all winning in the emperor war.
[01:26:38.392 --> 01:26:39.953]  We're all waking people up.
[01:26:40.974 --> 01:26:44.356]  But we've just got to get them to do something and get out of their seat.
[01:26:44.696 --> 01:26:50.340]  Get away from the football games, and the pizza pie and the beer, and try to go out and wake other people up.
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:54.843]  And that's what you do with fuzz, but a lot of people can't take that and might be jealous.
[01:26:54.923 --> 01:27:02.488]  I don't know what it is, God forgive me, but I mean they need to wake up and help you in some kind of way.
[01:27:03.763 --> 01:27:05.384]  Well, we're all helping each other together.
[01:27:05.444 --> 01:27:07.564]  I'm just one person on the team, Charles.
[01:27:08.284 --> 01:27:12.406]  How many copies of my films and other films have you given out?
[01:27:12.726 --> 01:27:12.406]  7,400.
[01:27:14.226 --> 01:27:16.727]  Well, see, so that's close to 1,000 a year.
[01:27:17.727 --> 01:27:21.188]  And I know you've woken up countless people.
[01:27:21.548 --> 01:27:24.169]  And that's an example of what somebody can do when they stop.
[01:27:25.061 --> 01:27:26.381]  Ninnying and complaining.
[01:27:26.401 --> 01:27:29.482]  It's kind of like we're on an old sailing ship in a horrible storm.
[01:27:29.902 --> 01:27:31.362]  One of the masts just broke off.
[01:27:31.682 --> 01:27:45.405]  We're trying to get the rest of the sails down, trying to batten down the hatches, and somebody's running around on the deck, whining and griping about, you know, the captain, you know, might play tiddlywinks secretly or something.
[01:27:45.745 --> 01:27:49.566]  Well, I would just like to ask the people, this is Christmas holiday, I do this every year.
[01:27:49.766 --> 01:27:50.986]  You let me know when I ask this.
[01:27:51.506 --> 01:27:55.750]  I ask the people, please get by one of your tapes and give to the members of their family.
[01:27:55.990 --> 01:28:01.075]  If they would do that for their family and country, I don't know if they would, but everybody needs to get a tape.
[01:28:01.715 --> 01:28:05.058]  Instead of just listening to you, they can start spreading the word with that one tape.
[01:28:05.379 --> 01:28:06.700]  They can invite people over.
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:08.321]  Have their friends look at it.
[01:28:08.582 --> 01:28:16.549]  You know, if they all just got one tape, like Endgame, or something, or 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny, or something, how many people, this audience, could wake up
[01:28:17.313 --> 01:28:24.098]  Just for this Christmas, give one tape of Alex Jones out, and you'll see a difference in your family.
[01:28:24.619 --> 01:28:26.400]  You'll see a difference in yourself.
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:27.861]  Charles, good to hear from you.
[01:28:28.602 --> 01:28:29.482]  Have a wonderful Christmas.
[01:28:29.502 --> 01:28:31.244]  Say hi to your wife and Chihuahua for me.
[01:28:34.106 --> 01:28:35.267]  That's the big frustration.
[01:28:35.867 --> 01:28:41.392]  If you will take action, if you will turn yourselves loose, if you will get on the game, we will win.
[01:28:43.954 --> 01:28:45.154]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.375 --> 01:28:46.856]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.874 --> 01:28:50.677]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.839 --> 01:29:03.508]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[01:29:03.568 --> 01:29:05.129]  The whole country's on a bust.
[01:29:05.249 --> 01:29:06.410]  The crazy driver.
[01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:08.572]  The passengers can't get hold of the wheel.
[01:29:08.932 --> 01:29:10.313]  We're all gonna go over the cliff.
[01:29:10.453 --> 01:29:12.775]  GCN brings you Uncivil Liberties.
[01:29:12.915 --> 01:29:14.997]  A movie the government does not want you to see.
[01:29:15.097 --> 01:29:17.599]  A political thriller ripped from today's headlines.
[01:29:17.699 --> 01:29:20.701]  Domestic spying, wiretapping, government shipping, and more.
[01:29:20.781 --> 01:29:23.764]  The government's gonna know where everybody's ass is every minute of the day and night.

[01:29:38.735 --> 01:29:41.478]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[01:29:41.498 --> 01:29:42.238]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[01:30:03.567 --> 01:30:08.031]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[01:30:08.351 --> 01:30:10.453]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[01:30:10.813 --> 01:30:11.874]  They keep you down.
[01:30:12.054 --> 01:30:12.975]  They keep you blue.
[01:30:13.255 --> 01:30:16.157]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:20.261]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[01:30:20.641 --> 01:30:26.025]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[01:30:27.919 --> 01:30:32.462]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[01:30:32.502 --> 01:30:36.725]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:30:37.325 --> 01:30:42.208]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.

[01:30:46.771 --> 01:30:48.913]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.

[01:30:53.644 --> 01:30:56.986]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[01:30:57.326 --> 01:31:04.229]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:31:04.589 --> 01:31:17.096]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[01:31:17.316 --> 01:31:19.977]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[01:31:20.297 --> 01:31:26.502]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[01:31:26.742 --> 01:31:31.886]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[01:31:32.126 --> 01:31:40.393]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[01:31:40.593 --> 01:31:41.233]  And the best part?
[01:31:41.453 --> 01:31:43.455]  My listeners pay absolutely nothing today.
[01:31:43.715 --> 01:31:46.298]  Simply go to 321release.com or call 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:14.940]  We're good to go.
[01:32:24.836 --> 01:32:25.236]  Ha!
[01:32:25.336 --> 01:32:26.677]  We are back live.
[01:32:26.717 --> 01:32:28.797]  I know we have a bunch of callers that are holding.
[01:32:28.817 --> 01:32:32.998]  We're going to have Burmese with us into the next hour, and we will be opening the phones up for you.
[01:32:33.018 --> 01:32:38.320]  We're going to be playing some audio clips from Loose Change Final Cut, because this film is a big deal.
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:39.540]  It's very well produced.
[01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:43.381]  It's the preeminent 9-11 truth film out there, all documented.
[01:32:43.401 --> 01:32:48.122]  I mean, it's just waking people up like nothing else I've seen.
[01:32:49.813 --> 01:33:00.175]  When it comes to the InfoWars, when it comes to 9-11, it is just so important that everyone see Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:33:02.156 --> 01:33:05.016]  And it's available right now at InfoWars.com.

[01:33:29.964 --> 01:33:37.546]  I know you are aware of 9-11 listeners, and many of you know it's an inside job, but your friends, your family, your neighbors, your co-workers don't.
[01:33:37.986 --> 01:33:42.987]  You don't even have to risk your job or your neighbors getting mad at you, even though most of them are awake now, at least to some degree.
[01:33:43.467 --> 01:33:46.568]  You just tell them, hey, here's loose change final cut.
[01:33:46.588 --> 01:33:47.768]  It's pretty controversial.
[01:33:48.348 --> 01:33:48.989]  I gave it to you.
[01:33:49.029 --> 01:33:49.829]  Pretty interesting stuff.
[01:33:49.889 --> 01:33:51.009]  Tell me what you think about it.
[01:33:51.889 --> 01:33:53.390]  Kind of like the nonchalant way.
[01:33:53.410 --> 01:33:55.390]  I wouldn't act like, hey, I got a King Cobra here.
[01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:56.450]  Take hold of it.
[01:33:57.731 --> 01:33:59.231]  I remember a decade ago trying to give
[01:34:00.177 --> 01:34:00.857]  We're good to go.
[01:34:14.821 --> 01:34:19.285]  But to make a long story short, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to get Loose Change Final Cut at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:19.685 --> 01:34:23.308]  And by the way, we're not discounting it because, you know, there's other investors and people involved.
[01:34:23.769 --> 01:34:24.449]  It's $19.95.
[01:34:24.509 --> 01:34:25.390]  That's still a good price.
[01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:30.314]  But when you get Loose Change Final Cut with in-game, we are discounting in-game by $5.
[01:34:31.613 --> 01:34:33.274]  And we have other big discounts on in-game.
[01:34:33.294 --> 01:34:35.995]  You can get in-game as low as $10.95 apiece.
[01:34:36.695 --> 01:34:41.697]  Again, no battling the malls, no battling the shooters.
[01:34:42.318 --> 01:34:43.698]  It's just crazy out there.
[01:34:43.738 --> 01:34:46.059]  I mean, it's out of control.
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:49.060]  I mean, I'm not going to a shopping mall.
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:49.460]  I hate them.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:52.762]  I go in one like once a year when there's something I've got to have that's at the mall.
[01:34:53.402 --> 01:34:55.083]  I refuse to go in Walmart now.
[01:34:55.783 --> 01:34:56.583]  I hate Target.
[01:34:56.663 --> 01:34:57.804]  But the point is, I don't like shopping.
[01:34:58.661 --> 01:35:02.483]  That's why I do Christmas shopping, birthday present shopping.
[01:35:03.463 --> 01:35:04.763]  And what do you give Charlie Sheen?
[01:35:04.783 --> 01:35:06.304]  He's always giving me really cool stuff.
[01:35:07.124 --> 01:35:07.605]  So nice.
[01:35:07.645 --> 01:35:13.547]  He gave me the jacket he wears, the Wolverine jacket that's on the cover that you see from Red Dawn, but side issue.
[01:35:13.567 --> 01:35:17.288]  I'm trying to think of a Christmas gift to him and I've been so busy I haven't gone and gotten it yet.
[01:35:18.449 --> 01:35:20.590]  And I'm already digressing here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:20.610 --> 01:35:21.350]  The point is,
[01:35:23.294 --> 01:35:27.636]  That why buy somebody a bottle of Jack Daniels that's going to rot their liver?
[01:35:27.797 --> 01:35:29.217]  Why buy them a fruit pie?
[01:35:29.297 --> 01:35:31.499]  Why buy them a tie they're not going to wear or not going to like?
[01:35:31.539 --> 01:35:32.779]  Why buy them some sweater?
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:46.327]  Why not just go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and A, you're going to save money and wake people up and get them a powerful info weapon and spread the word and B, you're not going to have to fight the crowds.
[01:35:47.731 --> 01:35:49.652]  I mean, go to Infowars.com.
[01:35:50.032 --> 01:36:03.757]  Every order that comes in from the 16th to midnight on the 17th, to the start of the 17th, every order that comes in by late next week will be shipped out by the 17th.
[01:36:04.178 --> 01:36:04.978]  I guess that's not next week.
[01:36:04.998 --> 01:36:06.118]  It's next Monday, the 16th.
[01:36:06.158 --> 01:36:09.080]  It'll be all shipped out, everything, by the 17th.
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:16.863]  By the way, the Bilderberg Group books that sold out, Daniel Estelin, they sold out before we even noticed, and we got a couple hundred behind
[01:36:18.163 --> 01:36:19.284]  And then the publisher was out.
[01:36:19.364 --> 01:36:20.184]  They have printed them.
[01:36:20.545 --> 01:36:24.067]  It's in the truck from Wisconsin, putting its way.
[01:36:24.087 --> 01:36:26.929]  Supposedly the truck's driving out today, and we're getting the tracking number.
[01:36:27.509 --> 01:36:34.053]  So that'll be shipping out to the back orders next week, but that's only people that ordered the Bilderberg Group with Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:36:34.874 --> 01:36:37.536]  So again, now is the time to spread the word.
[01:36:37.776 --> 01:36:40.077]  You are authorized to make copies of Endgame.
[01:36:40.157 --> 01:36:40.838]  I want you to.
[01:36:41.596 --> 01:36:43.737]  In fact, go get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:36:43.837 --> 01:36:45.077]  Burn it down to disk.
[01:36:45.137 --> 01:36:46.537]  It's super high quality there.
[01:36:47.377 --> 01:36:50.078]  For the month of December, you get five months free.
[01:36:51.498 --> 01:36:54.639]  Five months free when you sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:54.659 --> 01:36:55.539]  Go check out the offer.
[01:36:55.999 --> 01:36:58.120]  We're just trying to get the info out.
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:02.341]  As inflation goes up, as our costs go up, we're actually cutting prices.
[01:37:03.101 --> 01:37:04.421]  It's about the information.
[01:37:04.441 --> 01:37:06.822]  We've got 9-11 inside job ball caps.
[01:37:07.566 --> 01:37:09.387]  For what?
[01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:10.628]  $6.95 when you get it in a combo?
[01:37:10.648 --> 01:37:10.628]  $9.95?
[01:37:10.688 --> 01:37:12.690]  Then we're making like three, four bucks on those.
[01:37:12.970 --> 01:37:14.131]  Two bucks on the discounted one.
[01:37:14.391 --> 01:37:18.154]  We're selling t-shirts we get for like six dollars a piece for $9.95.
[01:37:18.574 --> 01:37:19.655]  Inside job t-shirts.
[01:37:19.735 --> 01:37:24.419]  It's about moving it out the door, getting it out to people in the info war.
[01:37:24.859 --> 01:37:25.239]  So again, 888-253-3139.
[01:37:30.418 --> 01:37:30.778]  888-253-3139.
[01:37:30.858 --> 01:37:35.879]  And if you're going to mail it to us, you've got a week to get the mail in to us.
[01:37:36.199 --> 01:37:36.759]  More than a week.
[01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:41.701]  But go ahead and get that mail in this week, so it gets here, so we can process it and get your order out.
[01:37:42.121 --> 01:37:44.921]  We ship it out to you UPS, that way you get it days before Christmas.
[01:37:45.402 --> 01:37:48.122]  And if you order now, you'll get it a lot sooner than that.
[01:37:48.222 --> 01:37:51.523]  We're up to two days behind now on shipping, which is good for us.
[01:37:51.963 --> 01:37:55.524]  It used to be about two weeks, but I've got great shippers back there and they
[01:37:56.858 --> 01:38:01.202]  We're shipping sometimes up to the day after, but right now it's about two days back.
[01:38:01.903 --> 01:38:04.425]  But we're getting it to where everything will be shipped out on the 17th.
[01:38:05.906 --> 01:38:07.368]  If your order comes in on the 16th.
[01:38:07.448 --> 01:38:08.669]  I've already belabored that.
[01:38:08.689 --> 01:38:14.654]  You can write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:38:16.596 --> 01:38:19.258]  And get in game, get final cut, loose change.
[01:38:19.679 --> 01:38:20.900]  Alright, going to Burmas.
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:23.322]  I kind of babbled there, but as I start thinking about it,
[01:38:24.471 --> 01:38:28.594]  Burmese, it is good to have you on, one of the producers of Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:38:28.994 --> 01:38:32.116]  I want to explain to people, this is an amazing film.
[01:38:32.596 --> 01:38:34.217]  This is not Loose Change 1 or 2.
[01:38:34.277 --> 01:38:37.859]  This is a totally new 9-11 film.
[01:38:38.199 --> 01:38:45.063]  Briefly break down the differences, some of the breaking news in this, and then we're going to go through a series of clips into the next hour, Jason.
[01:38:46.564 --> 01:38:49.926]  Sure, just to start, I mean, we started with the 9-11 truth movement itself.
[01:38:49.986 --> 01:38:53.008]  We showed how there were 2,000 of us down in New York City.
[01:38:55.402 --> 01:38:58.023]  Kind of set the stage for what the movement's all about.
[01:38:58.504 --> 01:39:00.645]  And then the opening credits, I mean, it's all new footage.
[01:39:00.725 --> 01:39:11.231]  It's Larry Klayman, it's Robert Wright, FBI whistleblower talking about himself and Barry Carmany trying to go after these terrorists prior to 9-11 and being thwarted by higher-ups and the FBI.
[01:39:12.331 --> 01:39:23.117]  After that, we really get into Bin Laden and whether he's really been indicted for 9-11 and the fact that we have Rex Toom of the FBI saying that he hasn't been indicted for 9-11 because there's no hard evidence.
[01:39:23.584 --> 01:39:25.666]  We then get into the hijackers and the U.S.
[01:39:25.746 --> 01:39:26.947]  Airbases they trained at.
[01:39:27.848 --> 01:39:30.510]  Two of them listed their home address as a Pensacola Navy Station.
[01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:32.752]  Others were trained at Monterey, California.
[01:39:33.532 --> 01:39:36.355]  Muhammad Ali was trained at Montgomery, Alabama's Air Force Base.
[01:39:36.375 --> 01:39:37.396]  I think it was Maxwell.
[01:39:38.016 --> 01:39:39.377]  And it just continues from there.
[01:39:39.417 --> 01:39:40.458]  We get into Able Danger.
[01:39:41.559 --> 01:39:44.902]  By the way, that's not debated for cops and others listening right now.
[01:39:45.282 --> 01:39:49.226]  The media admits, oh, they were trained at bases, but we're not going to discuss that.
[01:39:49.506 --> 01:39:51.848]  Look, inside job, end of story right there.
[01:39:52.751 --> 01:39:56.314]  Yeah, I mean, Brooks Air Force Base also had a hijacker's train there.
[01:39:56.434 --> 01:40:04.821]  It's pretty unbelievable, but when you actually see how many people tried to come forward with these people's identities, especially in able danger, and then they were silenced at the hearings.
[01:40:04.841 --> 01:40:09.965]  You had these three-and-a-half-hour hearings where, you know, Anthony Schaefer and others couldn't even speak.
[01:40:10.585 --> 01:40:15.069]  And Eric Kleinsmith got to speak before everybody, and he said, yeah, I believe them implicitly.
[01:40:15.309 --> 01:40:18.291]  You know, Mohammed Abed, his name was on that chart, his face was on that chart.
[01:40:18.311 --> 01:40:21.774]  We were tracking these guys, and we were being forced to be shut down.
[01:40:22.492 --> 01:40:28.595]  So we go over that evidence, and then from there we really delve into the war games heavier than anybody else has before, in my opinion.
[01:40:29.195 --> 01:40:39.720]  You know, we went through the NORAD tapes, we have a couple clips from that, but really we show how, you know, the CIA is running a drill at 8.45 in the morning of ramming a plane into a building from the National Reconnaissance Office.
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:46.083]  NORAD is running drills of hijacked aircraft going in and out of radar at the same exact time that's happening.
[01:40:46.539 --> 01:40:51.101]  And when you listen to these tapes, you know they're chasing Flight 11 for 40 minutes after it hit the tower.
[01:40:51.401 --> 01:40:53.122]  They're chasing hijackings out of Canada.
[01:40:53.162 --> 01:40:55.443]  They think Delta 1989 has a bomb on board.
[01:40:55.803 --> 01:40:57.664]  And everybody's discussing these exercises.
[01:40:59.425 --> 01:41:00.825]  Let's get started with these clips.
[01:41:00.845 --> 01:41:03.266]  Which one do you want to play first and describe the clip?
[01:41:03.967 --> 01:41:04.227]  Sure.
[01:41:04.487 --> 01:41:13.791]  I think we're going to bring up Sander Hicks, who's going to be describing the ISI wire transfer, which is Pakistani intelligence's involvement in funding these hijackers.
[01:41:14.884 --> 01:41:16.625]  Yeah, let's go ahead and play that clip first.
[01:41:18.006 --> 01:41:25.851]  And the Pakistanis, of course, if you know your history, have only been a couple of degrees of separation away from the so-called Al-Qaeda hijackers.
[01:41:26.812 --> 01:41:38.520]  The ISI has had a long-standing relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency, dating back to the 1980s with the establishment of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, which was evolved into Al-Qaeda.
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:43.523]  I focus in on the wire transfer that General Mahmoud Ahmed,
[01:41:45.004 --> 01:41:47.645]  wired to Muhammad Atta right before 9-11.
[01:41:48.425 --> 01:42:00.089]  That's pretty crucial because General Mahmoud Ahmed was actually meeting with key Washington DC insiders, Senator Bob Graham, Porter Goss, the future director of CIA, on the morning of 9-11.
[01:42:01.369 --> 01:42:08.912]  And he has a relationship not only with the CIA, but with Dick Armitage at the State Department, Mark Grossman at the State Department,
[01:42:09.694 --> 01:42:20.818]  And let's talk about that wire transfer because Governor Kaine had no basis for denial because the FBI and the Wall Street Journal confirmed that General Mahmoud Ahmed wire transfer I'm talking about.
[01:42:20.838 --> 01:42:27.641]  But the 9-11 Commission deliberately said that funding is not important and assigning blame is not important to them, but it is to us.
[01:42:29.941 --> 01:42:31.282]  Now Jason, what's the next clip?
[01:42:32.988 --> 01:42:46.031]  I believe it's just a quick clip of Cynthia McKinney discussing 9-11 that morning before we actually cut to her before, I think it was a defense budget hearing, confronting Rumsfeld and Myers about the war games on 9-11.
[01:42:47.071 --> 01:42:49.831]  Also, you got your cell phone close to some other equipment.
[01:42:49.871 --> 01:42:51.392]  It's really fizzling and sizzling.
[01:42:52.032 --> 01:42:55.252]  It's funny, Jason, your trademark is phones don't like you.
[01:42:55.873 --> 01:42:58.193]  I guess that's the joke that electronics goes crazy around you.
[01:42:59.255 --> 01:43:01.497]  Yeah, I'm a walking EMP, apparently.
[01:43:02.017 --> 01:43:07.382]  It's buzzing pretty bad, so I don't know if you got it by your computer, what you're doing, but, uh, what's this next clip again?
[01:43:07.402 --> 01:43:19.151]  Uh, this is Cynthia McKinney, uh, discussing the morning of 9-11, and I think it cuts into the Defense, uh, Department Budget hearings, where she confronts, uh, Myers and Rumsfeld about the war games that were being run on 9-11.
[01:43:19.311 --> 01:43:20.332]  Okay, let's play that clip.
[01:43:21.153 --> 01:43:28.919]  According to official accounts, four commercial airliners would be off course and out of communication, and not one of them would be intercepted.
[01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:44.689]  How is it that on four separate occasions, on one day, that a trillion dollar military and intelligence infrastructure could fail?
[01:43:49.193 --> 01:43:58.300]  And they're not going to queue up the second part, but yeah, I mean, she basically confronts Rumsfeld and Myers, and for the first time, they have to admit to these four CPX exercises.
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:10.590]  We now know there were more, but they actually say that it helped their response, and we all know that it actually confused people, it hindered their response, and they actually sent fighter jets out of the country so that we couldn't be defended.
[01:44:11.070 --> 01:44:13.392]  Now, which clip is that, and then John can find the name of it.
[01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:16.621]  It should play right after.
[01:44:16.641 --> 01:44:19.402]  I guess we didn't get the cuts.
[01:44:19.582 --> 01:44:21.382]  I guess we didn't get the cuts and send them to John Wright.
[01:44:21.422 --> 01:44:22.723]  Okay, what's the next clip?
[01:44:23.743 --> 01:44:36.507]  I believe the next clip is Ray McGovern discussing the Norman Mineta testimony, where Mineta clearly states that he is in the PEOC with Dick Cheney prior to the Pentagon strike, and we all know there were no alarms going off in the Pentagon.
[01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:41.982]  We also know because of Normanetta that an aide walked in and said, Sir, the plane is 50 miles out.
[01:44:42.002 --> 01:44:43.283]  Sir, the plane is 30 miles out.
[01:44:43.683 --> 01:44:45.965]  Sir, the plane is 10 miles out, so the orders still stand.
[01:44:46.345 --> 01:44:50.309]  Manetta thought it was a shoot-down order, but whatever hits the Pentagon is allowed to strike the Pentagon.
[01:44:50.885 --> 01:44:54.789]  And McGovern gives his take on that, having talked to Norm Mineta, actually.
[01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:57.211]  And Mineta's confirmed it on three different occasions.
[01:44:57.251 --> 01:45:02.416]  Not only before the 9-11 Commission, but on ABC News a year later, and then Seattle We Are Changed in front of him.
[01:45:02.856 --> 01:45:04.017]  Yeah, and he said no.
[01:45:04.318 --> 01:45:07.360]  He said Cheney's lying about claiming that he got there later.
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:08.882]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[01:45:10.134 --> 01:45:17.042]  When he got down to playing his ten miles out, the young man also said to the vice president, do the orders still stand?
[01:45:17.903 --> 01:45:21.247]  And the vice president turned and flipped his neck around and said,
[01:45:21.946 --> 01:45:23.267]  Of course the orders still stand.
[01:45:23.787 --> 01:45:25.448]  Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[01:45:25.809 --> 01:45:29.011]  Norman Netta was in the bunker with Cheney.
[01:45:29.471 --> 01:45:34.514]  And so, the fact that that wasn't in the 9-11 commission report was rather odd, don't you think?
[01:45:34.895 --> 01:45:35.735]  Yeah.
[01:45:35.775 --> 01:45:36.836]  Who was that young man?
[01:45:36.856 --> 01:45:38.437]  Did anybody ask who that young man was?
[01:45:38.857 --> 01:45:46.803]  Am I prepared to believe that Dick Cheney would be capable of knowing about this kind of attack on the Pentagon, for example, and allowing it to happen?
[01:45:47.723 --> 01:45:49.865]  Well, from what I know about Dick Cheney... Yeah!
[01:45:51.841 --> 01:45:54.164]  And I think that's the end of the Pentagon chapter right there.
[01:45:54.204 --> 01:46:00.014]  But there you have it, you know, a 26-year CIA analyst, worked with, you know, the former Bush administration.
[01:46:00.314 --> 01:46:02.678]  Yeah, he was the morning briefer for the Bush administration.
[01:46:03.331 --> 01:46:07.153]  Yeah, and he's saying that from what he knows about Dick Cheney, of course that's possible.
[01:46:07.433 --> 01:46:12.916]  And Dick Cheney went on Meet the Press four days after the attack and pretty much confirmed that he was in that POC.
[01:46:13.276 --> 01:46:21.241]  He said he watched the second plane strike live on television, and within moments, the Secret Service hustled into that location below the White House.
[01:46:21.601 --> 01:46:22.982]  So let's even give him ten minutes.
[01:46:23.002 --> 01:46:24.702]  Say the Secret Service came in at 914.
[01:46:25.003 --> 01:46:29.325]  He would have been in there by 922, just like Norman Ez said he was.
[01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:38.255]  But then he lies about it, just like Giuliani said he was told to get out of Building 7 because Tower 1 and 2, North and South Tower, were going to collapse.
[01:46:38.275 --> 01:46:40.076]  He said it on two different TV programs.
[01:46:40.536 --> 01:46:43.438]  Then he lied and said he never said it, and the news went and got the clips.
[01:46:44.058 --> 01:46:50.542]  And then it turns out they were running a drill at the World Trade Center being attacked by terrorists that day, and had already moved his offices out days before.
[01:46:50.963 --> 01:46:52.503]  Let's go ahead and go to the next clip.
[01:46:52.523 --> 01:46:53.264]  What's the next section?
[01:46:54.148 --> 01:47:05.414]  I believe the next section is Kevin Ryan of Underwriters Laboratory discussing when he found out that the floor models didn't collapse with their tests going public and basically being castrated for it.
[01:47:05.935 --> 01:47:06.515]  Here it is.
[01:47:07.215 --> 01:47:16.360]  As part of their investigation, NIST contracted Underwriters Laboratories to recreate floor models from the Twin Towers for the purpose of fire resistance tests.
[01:47:17.081 --> 01:47:18.161]  We heard about it on the news.
[01:47:18.201 --> 01:47:21.063]  We heard about it right away that the floors didn't collapse.
[01:47:22.595 --> 01:47:26.076]  So they tested these huge models.
[01:47:26.136 --> 01:47:34.379]  Their models, the Pershing, which is a long model, was essentially the same size and exactly the same as one of the types of core section tubes.
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:37.401]  And they tested it according to ASTM 119.
[01:47:37.661 --> 01:47:45.203]  They exposed it to much longer fire and higher temperatures than we know were present in the electricity.
[01:47:45.283 --> 01:47:47.304]  So right away, there was a problem.
[01:47:47.804 --> 01:47:48.505]  And that's August of 2004.
[01:47:51.041 --> 01:48:04.109]  So again, you know, we have this huge problem, and NIST has now stated that they don't need to actually discuss the entire collapse, that they only had to discuss collapse initiation, because, as John Gross says in this film, the videos speak for themselves.
[01:48:04.649 --> 01:48:09.932]  And they're not going to attempt to try to explain how that happened, because it would be impossible without explosives, Alex.
[01:48:12.713 --> 01:48:13.594]  What's the next clip?
[01:48:14.635 --> 01:48:19.317]  I believe it's Stephen Jones going into Gordon Roth, who's a structural engineer.
[01:48:19.738 --> 01:48:20.318]  Let's play that.
[01:48:22.338 --> 01:48:29.464]  And our conclusion is that the building should not have fallen that rapidly if, indeed, fire caused the collapse.
[01:48:29.945 --> 01:48:39.674]  In fact, there's one mechanical engineer, Gordon Ross, in the Journal of 9-1-1 Studies, who's done a thorough analysis based on conservation momentum.
[01:48:40.314 --> 01:48:50.404]  If the official story was correct, then the heating that was supposed to cause the failure would have been a much slower event and it would have been an asymmetric event.
[01:48:51.064 --> 01:48:59.132]  For the tower to collapse straight down onto itself, it flies in the face of what we know about steel and how steel behaves.
[01:48:59.512 --> 01:49:06.080]  When we have a failure in one area, then the failures tend to continue within that area, and we see an asymmetric collapse.
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:11.706]  Possibly the upper section falling off as it's twisting away from the tower and falling off.
[01:49:12.247 --> 01:49:20.176]  But it's very unusual to see the upper section falling straight through the path of the greatest resistance, which is straight down through the middle of the tower.
[01:49:21.966 --> 01:49:24.147]  It just does not add up.
[01:49:25.107 --> 01:49:33.552]  The temperatures that we know existed within the collapse, within the debris pile, are physically impossible from an atmospheric jet fuel fire.
[01:49:33.772 --> 01:49:34.592]  It cannot be done.
[01:49:34.973 --> 01:49:38.915]  What we should have seen in the debris pile was a pyramidal shape.
[01:49:38.935 --> 01:49:44.538]  If it had been a gravitational collapse, we would have seen a roughly pyramidal shape, or a conic shape.
[01:49:44.938 --> 01:49:53.425]  What we actually did see was a massive ejection of dusted debris and live sections of steel from well away from the tower.
[01:49:54.266 --> 01:49:55.667]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:55.687 --> 01:49:57.809]  A new world order.
[01:49:58.510 --> 01:50:02.733]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:50:03.414 --> 01:50:05.195]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:50:06.236 --> 01:50:08.478]  Both their objective being world domination.
[01:50:09.039 --> 01:50:11.441]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[01:50:12.175 --> 01:50:19.532]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:22.521 --> 01:50:27.524]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:28.005 --> 01:50:31.467]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.847 --> 01:50:34.389]  Build America's base and make progress toward a world with government.
[01:50:34.409 --> 01:50:35.550]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:36.330]  They're not after money.
[01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:37.431]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.651 --> 01:50:38.412]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.632 --> 01:50:39.653]  That's what I have to do, sir.

[01:51:53.001 --> 01:51:56.444]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:51:56.684 --> 01:51:58.806]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:51:58.946 --> 01:52:01.408]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:52:01.668 --> 01:52:06.031]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[01:52:06.072 --> 01:52:06.752]  Here's why.
[01:52:07.152 --> 01:52:13.097]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:52:13.317 --> 01:52:19.322]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[01:52:19.562 --> 01:52:20.483]  But they're not cheating.
[01:52:20.703 --> 01:52:24.707]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:52:24.907 --> 01:52:29.252]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:52:29.332 --> 01:52:36.859]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:52:36.879 --> 01:52:37.440]  Get control.
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:38.280]  Get relief.
[01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:39.041]  Get some sleep.
[01:52:39.141 --> 01:52:42.363]  Go to www.OutIn90.com.
[01:52:42.463 --> 01:52:45.844]  That's www.OutIn90.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.884 --> 01:52:46.065]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:17.725]  We're good to go.
[01:53:19.565 --> 01:53:29.051]  The centrifuges that we know existed within the collapse, within the debris pile, are physically impossible from an atmospheric jet fuel fire cannot be done.
[01:53:29.451 --> 01:53:33.433]  What we should have seen in the debris pile was a pyramidal shape.
[01:53:33.453 --> 01:53:39.036]  If it had been a gravity driven collapse, we would have seen a roughly pyramidal shape or a conic shape.
[01:53:39.416 --> 01:53:47.061]  What we actually did see was a massive ejection of dust and debris and large sections of steel from well away from the towers.
[01:53:47.601 --> 01:53:48.302]  We're good to go.
[01:53:58.746 --> 01:54:00.888]  Now, that's Gordon Ross, structural engineer.
[01:54:00.948 --> 01:54:03.250]  There are now thousands of engineers that have spoken out.
[01:54:03.310 --> 01:54:05.632]  Hundreds and hundreds that are in major groups.
[01:54:05.692 --> 01:54:09.595]  And that's just a fraction, Jason, of what's in Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:54:09.655 --> 01:54:11.156]  Again, folks, people need to see this film.
[01:54:11.457 --> 01:54:12.838]  This is a totally new film.
[01:54:12.918 --> 01:54:15.760]  It's all on what can be documented, what can be proven.
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:20.884]  The hijacker section alone that documents that they were trained at bases and led into the U.S.
[01:54:20.964 --> 01:54:22.886]  and protected, that's not debated.
[01:54:23.747 --> 01:54:27.770]  And if we can educate the public on this, the whole house of cards comes down, Jason.
[01:54:28.938 --> 01:54:32.601]  Absolutely, and that's why, you know, we were really aiming for a new audience with this one.
[01:54:32.621 --> 01:54:41.347]  This is an entirely new film, and really we stuck to what the government and the mainstream media has said and what the perceived notions of 9-11 are, and we disproved them one by one.
[01:54:41.747 --> 01:54:52.234]  I mean, people don't understand that Dick Cheney and George Bush testified for an hour together, not under oath, where there was no transcript or no recording of what actually happened there.
[01:54:52.254 --> 01:54:55.056]  You know, people don't get it, that this thing is rigged from the start.
[01:54:56.064 --> 01:54:58.045]  Now there's one more clip we've got time to play.
[01:54:58.085 --> 01:54:58.705]  Which clip is that?
[01:54:58.725 --> 01:55:02.726]  I think it's the John Schroeder clip, I'm pretty sure.
[01:55:02.766 --> 01:55:04.247]  The firefighter who was in the lobby.
[01:55:04.707 --> 01:55:05.847]  Yeah, let's go ahead and play that clip.
[01:55:05.867 --> 01:55:06.307]  Here it is.
[01:55:07.648 --> 01:55:12.789]  Firefighter John Schroeder arrived in the lobby of the North Tower shortly after the first plane struck.
[01:55:13.590 --> 01:55:15.770]  So we're standing there in the lobby, we're getting all together.
[01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:18.051]  All of a sudden, we hear...
[01:55:21.943 --> 01:55:26.786]  I looked down to my right, and the elevators exploded, some kind of like a Bruce Willis die hard movie.
[01:55:27.246 --> 01:55:31.929]  People just come running out of the elevators, on fire, fireball.
[01:55:33.210 --> 01:55:34.871]  I mean, it was like, what is going on?
[01:55:34.911 --> 01:55:36.052]  Here, something's up here.
[01:55:36.192 --> 01:55:38.413]  I mean, a plane's up there, now there's fire down here.
[01:55:39.594 --> 01:55:42.096]  People running around, we're on fire, this is crazy.
[01:55:42.116 --> 01:55:45.738]  So we were heading up to the 24th floor of the stairwell, and
[01:55:46.494 --> 01:55:47.814]  All of a sudden we heard, Mayday!
[01:55:47.854 --> 01:55:48.334]  Mayday!
[01:55:48.394 --> 01:55:49.115]  Second plane!
[01:55:49.195 --> 01:55:50.655]  Second plane!
[01:55:50.675 --> 01:55:50.955]  Swift!
[01:55:51.095 --> 01:55:53.276]  We're looking at each other like, come on, second plane!
[01:55:53.296 --> 01:55:54.716]  There's no way there's a second plane!
[01:55:55.216 --> 01:55:58.597]  Within seconds, our building got rocked!
[01:55:58.637 --> 01:56:01.457]  We got bounced around in the stairwell like pinballs, man.
[01:56:01.937 --> 01:56:03.198]  And we just said, you know what?
[01:56:03.258 --> 01:56:03.898]  Time to go.
[01:56:04.458 --> 01:56:10.459]  We got down to the lobby, and everything was blown out, exploded, everything was... We were the only ones in the lobby now.
[01:56:10.519 --> 01:56:11.960]  We're going, wait a second here.
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:13.020]  Where is everybody?
[01:56:14.397 --> 01:56:18.240]  Because the building was coming down the outside, they moved the command post to World Trade Center too.
[01:56:18.941 --> 01:56:23.444]  So now we're like, we didn't get no, where is everybody?
[01:56:23.944 --> 01:56:29.649]  We were in the lobby, it looks like everything was exploded, everything was gone, we're like, what is going on here?
[01:56:30.409 --> 01:56:32.051]  We didn't know, we were like, this is crazy.
[01:56:32.791 --> 01:56:39.937]  But for every window in the lobby to be exploded, I mean them windows were like as thick as spaghetti.
[01:56:40.615 --> 01:56:42.676]  They were two, three inch glasses, you know, come on.
[01:56:43.037 --> 01:56:47.159]  They exploded out of the lobby, you know, something.
[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:49.281]  It wasn't, it wasn't from the jet fuel.
[01:56:49.481 --> 01:56:50.382]  No way.
[01:56:50.842 --> 01:56:52.063]  The elevators exploded.
[01:56:52.083 --> 01:56:53.484]  They went down from the lobby.
[01:56:53.984 --> 01:56:56.426]  The lobby was over here.
[01:56:56.446 --> 01:56:57.426]  That should never have happened.
[01:56:57.486 --> 01:56:58.447]  Something went happen here.
[01:56:58.487 --> 01:57:01.129]  And that wasn't, that wasn't, we came down.
[01:57:01.209 --> 01:57:03.470]  It was, it looked like a bomb went off in the lobby.
[01:57:04.271 --> 01:57:05.031]  There was no fire.
[01:57:05.091 --> 01:57:06.032]  It just looked like a bomb went off.
[01:57:07.549 --> 01:57:11.412]  And then of course, reports of bombs inside Building 7 as well, and dead bodies everywhere.
[01:57:11.473 --> 01:57:31.270]  Final segment with Jason Bermas and more of your calls, economic news, and then former CIA Field Commander Robert Baer is scheduled to be joining us to continue to bring you the highest quality of guest information here, an attempt to get you thinking and then taking action against the global crime syndicate, the global corporations that are attempting to set up a world government for their administrative convenience.

[01:58:16.548 --> 01:58:19.409]  We are now into hour number three.
[01:58:19.489 --> 01:58:20.929]  Robert Baer, former C.N.A.A.
[01:58:21.029 --> 01:58:24.050]  commander, now written a book about 9-11 inside job.
[01:58:25.331 --> 01:58:28.151]  And we'll be talking with him about the Iran situation.
[01:58:28.211 --> 01:58:29.692]  A lot more coming up in about 30 minutes.
[01:58:29.752 --> 01:58:30.952]  I know we got a lot of people holding.
[01:58:31.392 --> 01:58:33.553]  For those holding, I'm going to get to your calls in the next segment.
[01:58:34.473 --> 01:58:37.794]  Jason Burmiss joins us from the field today via cell phone.
[01:58:38.534 --> 01:58:42.896]  And we are here talking about loose change final cut that just came out two weeks ago.
[01:58:43.796 --> 01:58:44.436]  Three weeks ago.
[01:58:45.788 --> 01:58:52.451]  I think about three weeks ago now, and it's a totally new film, and it's got revelation after revelation after revelation.
[01:58:52.491 --> 01:58:55.353]  It's the one 9-11 film everybody's got to see.
[01:58:55.413 --> 01:59:03.696]  It's totally new, totally different, totally new 9-11 film compared to the previous incarnations of loose change.
[01:59:03.736 --> 01:59:10.099]  So I hope you will go to InfoWars.com, and let's say you already know all about 9-11.
[01:59:10.199 --> 01:59:12.260]  Well, go put in somebody else's address.
[01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:13.401]  We'll gift ship to people.
[01:59:14.187 --> 01:59:26.080]  You know, just let them know a president's coming and give us their address, pay for it, and we will ship Loose Change, Final Cut, or End Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement, or both of them together in a combo deal we've got, to whoever you want.
[01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:27.742]  This needs to be seen.
[01:59:28.303 --> 01:59:30.265]  Or call toll free to get Loose Change, Final Cut, 888-253-3139.
[01:59:35.552 --> 01:59:37.092]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:59:37.112 --> 01:59:42.234]  Now, you just heard about 10 minutes of a film.
[01:59:42.274 --> 01:59:43.494]  It's just about 2 hours long.
[01:59:43.514 --> 01:59:45.715]  I don't have the film in front of me, Jason.
[01:59:45.755 --> 01:59:47.115]  I've seen it so many times, but I forget.
[01:59:47.515 --> 01:59:49.035]  How long is Loose Change Final Cut?
[01:59:49.776 --> 01:59:52.936]  It's actually 2 hours and 10 minutes long, and we had to cut out a chapter.
[01:59:52.956 --> 01:59:53.977]  That's another 10 minutes.
[01:59:54.337 --> 01:59:56.457]  And, of course, there are a couple other extras on the DVD.
[01:59:57.357 --> 02:00:01.879]  So, really, it's a 2-hour, 20-minute film because one of the extras is just another chapter?
[02:00:02.639 --> 02:00:03.279]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:00:04.853 --> 02:00:07.014]  I thought it was over two hours, I just wanted to make sure on that.
[02:00:07.615 --> 02:00:14.858]  And it's such an important film, and you guys went the route, you could have sold your rights out to some big outfits, but then they could do something like shelve it.
[02:00:15.759 --> 02:00:28.185]  We had the Mark Cuban guy, but notice he took the redacted, the Palma film, the Palma film about Iraq being a slaughterhouse and the raping and murdering of innocent women and children, and you notice that they just bought that film and shelved it.
[02:00:29.384 --> 02:00:46.919]  Yeah, that's what I've been telling people is, you know, when we saw something on paper, you don't have final editorial control, and, uh, you know, there's no guarantees, and then you see what someone like Bryan Singer, who did Scarface, one of the biggest movies of all time, when he, you know, has a take on the Iraq War that's a little, a little too harsh, they edited his film heavily, and they pretty much shelved it.
[02:00:47.159 --> 02:00:48.621]  People don't even know it's available.
[02:00:49.201 --> 02:00:50.442]  Well, that's De Palma's film.
[02:00:51.883 --> 02:00:53.485]  Oh, you're talking about Redacted, right?
[02:00:54.005 --> 02:00:54.866]  Yeah, Redacted, yeah.
[02:00:55.706 --> 02:00:57.708]  Yeah, that's De Palma from Scarface.
[02:00:58.469 --> 02:01:00.952]  I guess one of the other guys from Scarface is also involved.
[02:01:01.072 --> 02:01:01.994]  He got censored too.
[02:01:02.574 --> 02:01:04.777]  But yeah, Redacted is an incredible film.
[02:01:05.117 --> 02:01:07.420]  I've talked to folks that have seen it and you can't see it.
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:08.161]  It's not in theaters.
[02:01:08.181 --> 02:01:09.482]  It was shown in a few places.
[02:01:09.863 --> 02:01:13.327]  This is De Palma who makes hit after hit with Oliver Stone and others.
[02:01:13.367 --> 02:01:14.749]  You're just not going to get a chance to see it.
[02:01:15.529 --> 02:01:17.810]  Because 2929 got it, and I don't know what they've done with it.
[02:01:17.830 --> 02:01:20.070]  But the point is, you guys could have done deals with them.
[02:01:20.510 --> 02:01:22.291]  You didn't because you wanted to have the control.
[02:01:22.731 --> 02:01:23.591]  And I salute you.
[02:01:23.711 --> 02:01:27.952]  Now is the job of getting this DVD out to everybody.
[02:01:28.512 --> 02:01:35.714]  And Jason, I just want to thank you for all you've done working behind the scenes to ensure this final cut did come out.
[02:01:36.214 --> 02:01:37.754]  And it's a very, very impressive film.
[02:01:37.854 --> 02:01:40.335]  And it's all new information, all the latest developments.
[02:01:40.755 --> 02:01:41.595]  I just hope people will get it.
[02:01:42.867 --> 02:01:43.507]  Me too, Alex.
[02:01:43.587 --> 02:01:49.551]  And you know, like you said, the holiday season is really the time with your family, and you can sit them down and show them this film.
[02:01:49.591 --> 02:01:50.211]  We hope you get it.
[02:01:50.231 --> 02:01:51.111]  We hope you make copies.
[02:01:51.151 --> 02:01:51.932]  We hope you hand them out.
[02:01:53.533 --> 02:01:59.296]  Well, the bottom line here is that people are ripe now to wake up to 9-11 and make an inside job.
[02:01:59.336 --> 02:02:09.521]  Did you see how the former Italian, Italian, Italian, I'm showing my Texas colors here, the former Italian president came out and said 9-11 is an inside job?
[02:02:10.382 --> 02:02:14.325]  Yeah, he not only said that, he said it's pretty much a joke within the intelligence community.
[02:02:14.345 --> 02:02:15.426]  He said it's common knowledge.
[02:02:15.766 --> 02:02:18.348]  And he said it was a CIA slash Mossad operation.
[02:02:18.688 --> 02:02:26.193]  I really enjoyed the 9-11 truth group up in Canada confronting the former Prime Minister there and handing them a copy of the final cut.
[02:02:26.454 --> 02:02:29.756]  Hopefully people are going to follow up on that and make sure he actually watches the material.
[02:02:30.757 --> 02:02:33.098]  Tell folks when your show's on on Genesis Weeknights.
[02:02:34.499 --> 02:02:39.123]  My show is on 8 to 10 Eastern at 7 to 9 Central on Stream 4 on GCN.
[02:02:39.898 --> 02:02:41.219]  All right, Bubba, good talking to you.
[02:02:41.259 --> 02:02:42.080]  I'll talk to you during the break.
[02:02:46.402 --> 02:02:47.823]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:48.884 --> 02:02:49.925]  A new world order.
[02:02:50.645 --> 02:02:55.028]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful group of government.
[02:02:55.709 --> 02:02:58.330]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:02:58.370 --> 02:03:00.592]  But their objective be world domination.
[02:03:01.152 --> 02:03:03.554]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:04.324 --> 02:03:11.654]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:14.665 --> 02:03:19.648]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:20.129 --> 02:03:23.611]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:23.991 --> 02:03:26.513]  Bill Burgess makes great progress in the world government.
[02:03:26.553 --> 02:03:27.694]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:27.714 --> 02:03:28.474]  They're not after money.
[02:03:28.494 --> 02:03:29.555]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:29.795 --> 02:03:30.536]  They're after power.
[02:03:30.756 --> 02:03:31.796]  That's what they're after.

[02:05:01.087 --> 02:05:01.327]  I think so.
[02:05:17.958 --> 02:05:27.420]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.

[02:05:47.230 --> 02:05:53.254]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.854 --> 02:05:56.916]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.276 --> 02:06:00.018]  All right, I want to cover the economic numbers that are coming in.
[02:06:00.078 --> 02:06:02.739]  They're, to say the least, not pleasing.
[02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:04.721]  Run for the hills!
[02:06:04.761 --> 02:06:05.421]  Run for the hills!
[02:06:05.861 --> 02:06:06.622]  It's not good!
[02:06:06.782 --> 02:06:07.382]  Incoming!
[02:06:08.043 --> 02:06:08.443]  Ah-ha!
[02:06:08.483 --> 02:06:09.343]  Brace for impact!
[02:06:11.185 --> 02:06:12.705]  But let's blast through a bunch of your calls.
[02:06:12.745 --> 02:06:13.466]  We're going to move quick here.
[02:06:14.733 --> 02:06:16.474]  Let's talk to Rob and P.A.
[02:06:16.534 --> 02:06:17.515]  You're on the air.
[02:06:17.555 --> 02:06:18.435]  Oh, is Corey next?
[02:06:20.496 --> 02:06:21.777]  Rob and P.A., you're on the air.
[02:06:21.817 --> 02:06:22.217]  Go ahead.
[02:06:23.038 --> 02:06:23.478]  Hey, Alex.
[02:06:23.498 --> 02:06:24.339]  Thank you very much.
[02:06:25.399 --> 02:06:26.180]  Kudos to you.
[02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:30.862]  I wanted to thank you for a great lineup this week with Corsi, Roberts, Buchanan.
[02:06:32.003 --> 02:06:41.869]  It's just oftentimes out here I feel like a lone wolf, you know, and to have those great intellects talk about the same subjects that
[02:06:42.833 --> 02:06:44.854]  That you bring up every week.
[02:06:45.694 --> 02:06:49.515]  It's good to know you're not alone, especially with those respected men.
[02:06:49.775 --> 02:06:54.817]  That's one of the only illusions the establishment has left, is that we're all alone.
[02:06:54.897 --> 02:06:56.037]  No, we're the majority.
[02:06:57.517 --> 02:07:04.740]  I understand that, and you had an epiphany or breakthrough last week, and I resonated with that when you talked about the 1,500 or the 1,500,000 trillion
[02:07:10.727 --> 02:07:13.589]  It's such a large number you can't even wrap your head around it.
[02:07:14.009 --> 02:07:14.650]  Of derivatives?
[02:07:15.630 --> 02:07:15.890]  Yes.
[02:07:17.211 --> 02:07:33.661]  And to see Bush today and Paulson and Bernanke and the whole crew on Wall Street in Washington come out with this problem, reaction, solution with this subprime mortgage debacle that they created.
[02:07:33.681 --> 02:07:35.883]  Yeah, five year mortgage freeze.
[02:07:39.269 --> 02:07:43.991]  It's just, it sort of makes our whole economy, not sort of, it is.
[02:07:44.111 --> 02:07:45.132]  It's monopoly money.
[02:07:45.452 --> 02:07:48.213]  It's just, it has no meaning and no value.
[02:07:49.613 --> 02:08:03.299]  They can change the rules, and it goes back to what, you know, the Federal Reserve and the IRS, it's just absolutely incredible what these guys can get away with, and then make it look like they're the saviors.
[02:08:03.319 --> 02:08:06.580]  They're going to save these two million mortgages over the next two years.
[02:08:07.843 --> 02:08:08.924]  And put a freeze.
[02:08:10.004 --> 02:08:23.612]  But it doesn't talk about the investor, the company or group of, you know, like down in Florida, the teachers' funds and the state funds that were, you know, the AAA paper they thought they bought.
[02:08:23.792 --> 02:08:27.954]  Well, you know states are jerking that money by the tens of millions right now.
[02:08:28.214 --> 02:08:35.158]  I know, but that's the thing that they don't address, is the investor who bought that bundle of paper
[02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:45.413]  Knowing that the rate was going to go from 7% to 13% after the adjustment, and built their bonds and their portfolio around that business model.
[02:08:46.454 --> 02:08:49.875]  There was no regulators when they came out with these subprime loans.
[02:08:49.975 --> 02:08:53.677]  Now all of a sudden there's regulators that are going to freeze them for five years.
[02:08:54.597 --> 02:09:04.622]  It's just mind-blowing to me how these corporate, fascist neocons can get away with it and make it look... Like you always say,
[02:09:07.194 --> 02:09:17.808]  I mean, this is too little too late, because the guy who's holding a subprime mortgage that's going to readjust, his house went from, let's say, $300,000 to $200,000 in value, and he just lost his job.
[02:09:22.532 --> 02:09:23.853]  He's going to walk away from that.
[02:09:24.293 --> 02:09:25.494]  It's going to be foreclosed.
[02:09:25.614 --> 02:09:26.095]  That's right.
[02:09:26.595 --> 02:09:26.975]  That's right.
[02:09:27.075 --> 02:09:36.622]  Freezing a mortgage that's going to go from 7% to 12% or from 8% to 13% is going to do absolutely nothing overall.
[02:09:36.962 --> 02:09:41.105]  And now the credit cards are coming to over $25,000 a person on average.
[02:09:41.825 --> 02:09:48.150]  Now all these other derivatives which make the junk paper on the subprimes look like a walk in the park.
[02:09:48.450 --> 02:09:54.552]  Well, Alex, it was just announced today that foreclosure rate is at an all-time 20-year high.
[02:09:56.052 --> 02:10:05.075]  And the other headline yesterday was Bristol-Myers Squibb laying off 10% of its workforce, saving $1.5 billion.
[02:10:05.235 --> 02:10:10.577]  It harkens me back to last week with the debate.
[02:10:11.097 --> 02:10:14.098]  I know you saw it with Ron Paul and McCain.
[02:10:15.655 --> 02:10:19.677]  And they talked about the Iraq War and the cut and run.
[02:10:20.577 --> 02:10:21.837]  It was two weeks ago, I guess.
[02:10:21.937 --> 02:10:22.178]  Yes.
[02:10:22.678 --> 02:10:29.981]  And then Paul said, you know, McCain said, well, you're going to pull all the funding for our troops and leave them high and dry.
[02:10:30.881 --> 02:10:37.984]  And Paul said, no, there's plenty of money in the pipeline to bring these troops home and to clean up that mess and get out of there.
[02:10:39.304 --> 02:10:39.884]  Plenty of money.
[02:10:40.845 --> 02:10:44.066]  There's trillions and trillions of dollars floating all over.
[02:10:44.975 --> 02:10:45.415]  I don't know.
[02:10:45.435 --> 02:10:47.297]  I don't know.
[02:11:08.372 --> 02:11:12.817]  Of this fractional reserve banking, where they take a dollar and loan it out a thousand times.
[02:11:12.937 --> 02:11:14.578]  It's just, there's nothing there.
[02:11:14.779 --> 02:11:17.141]  It's all vapor paper, as I call it.
[02:11:17.962 --> 02:11:19.763]  That's a good term, vapor paper.
[02:11:20.124 --> 02:11:23.707]  But, I mean, the music's stopping in this game of musical chairs now.
[02:11:24.468 --> 02:11:26.710]  I know, because it became a global issue.
[02:11:27.591 --> 02:11:31.615]  And, you know, Britain lowered their interest rate today 25 basis points.
[02:11:33.573 --> 02:11:35.494]  Yeah, and the pound is already so much more valuable than the dollar.
[02:11:55.217 --> 02:12:12.032]  They're trying to get the Germans, the European Union, and everybody else to lower their interest rates right now, so we can lower them again, but if they're already so much more overvalued, that paltry cut isn't going to help the dollar if they cut rates here.
[02:12:12.052 --> 02:12:13.953]  I know.
[02:12:14.274 --> 02:12:20.139]  I just hope, and we all hope, that Ron Paul is successful.
[02:12:21.602 --> 02:12:24.725]  And when he is successful, he gets rid of the Federal Reserve.
[02:12:24.785 --> 02:12:25.766]  That is the worst.
[02:12:26.647 --> 02:12:31.091]  It enslaved a whole world.
[02:12:36.565 --> 02:12:45.709]  We have to be telling people who to blame right now because the same bankers that run the central banks are going to be prancing around during the big depression or recession or whatever it's going to be.
[02:12:46.149 --> 02:12:47.369]  On the good side, recession.
[02:12:47.409 --> 02:12:50.931]  On the bad side, global meltdown, Armageddon, financial Armageddon.
[02:12:51.391 --> 02:12:59.694]  We have to be blaming them now and we have to be telling people who the real enemy is right now so they don't run around as the savior if all this unravels.
[02:13:00.014 --> 02:13:01.815]  Now, I mean, it is unraveling.
[02:13:01.835 --> 02:13:03.675]  The question is how much will it unravel?
[02:13:03.936 --> 02:13:05.096]  How much do you think it will unravel?
[02:13:07.037 --> 02:13:07.437]  I don't know.
[02:13:07.537 --> 02:13:10.460]  I don't know where the stop-losses can be put in place.
[02:13:12.181 --> 02:13:18.166]  I just like what Pat Buchanan had to say about Ron Paul's campaign, and that is to keep getting the word out.
[02:13:18.246 --> 02:13:24.672]  Even if New Hampshire and Iowa, just keep getting the word out.
[02:13:24.772 --> 02:13:28.455]  I think the stars and the moons are lining up, Alex.
[02:13:28.915 --> 02:13:29.776]  I have it in my gut.
[02:13:30.036 --> 02:13:30.596]  And Aaron Russo.
[02:13:35.666 --> 02:13:37.869]  God, I can still hear his voice echoing.
[02:13:39.410 --> 02:13:40.572]  And you tried to calm him down.
[02:13:40.592 --> 02:13:44.836]  I don't know if you remember that interview where he wanted to march on Washington.
[02:13:45.097 --> 02:13:53.006]  I mean, he was that passionate about the Fed and the IRS and the Federal Reserve.
[02:13:53.847 --> 02:13:55.609]  And I think it might have to come to that.
[02:13:55.689 --> 02:13:55.969]  I don't know.
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:58.741]  Well, I knew at that time he couldn't even walk.
[02:13:58.761 --> 02:14:05.825]  Nobody else knew that, except his family, but I'd visited him and talked to him, so he couldn't lead us to Washington when he couldn't walk.
[02:14:05.845 --> 02:14:08.946]  Plus, you have nothing to lose when you know you're about to die.
[02:14:09.406 --> 02:14:12.608]  But the last thing we want is a shooting war, because that's the excuse they need.
[02:14:12.628 --> 02:14:17.891]  We need to let their system fall apart, let everybody know they're the criminals, and not get involved in it.
[02:14:17.931 --> 02:14:18.631]  Thank you for the call.
[02:14:18.651 --> 02:14:19.311]  I appreciate it.
[02:14:20.812 --> 02:14:21.693]  Who's up next here?
[02:14:21.873 --> 02:14:23.113]  Rico in Toronto.
[02:14:23.133 --> 02:14:23.634]  You're on the air.
[02:14:23.674 --> 02:14:24.294]  Go ahead, Rico.
[02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:35.554]  Yes, Alex, earlier you were talking about the drugs that people, they were putting people on, and the anti-psychotic drugs.
[02:14:36.155 --> 02:14:53.622]  Well, I have a friend, she got on, she told me the name of it, she started to take cocaine, she got addicted to that, and then the psychiatrist that she saw, she was like really young, like 14 years old, the psychiatrist that she saw said, well, I don't know really what
[02:14:54.238 --> 02:15:02.500]  To diagnose you with, so he just said, uh, I'm going to diagnose you with anything and, um, uh, you should take something called Seroquel.
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:06.680]  And she started to take that and she tried to get off of it.
[02:15:06.780 --> 02:15:08.161]  And for three weeks, she couldn't sleep.
[02:15:10.481 --> 02:15:12.281]  Well, these are all hardcore drugs.
[02:15:12.341 --> 02:15:18.083]  It's like, it's like going in because you've got a finger cut and they chop your arm off.
[02:15:18.783 --> 02:15:19.303]  There you go.
[02:15:19.323 --> 02:15:20.423]  Cause he made it worse.
[02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:24.191]  Because now if she tries to get off of it, she can't.
[02:15:24.631 --> 02:15:27.732]  She has to completely go back because... Look, it's a business!
[02:15:27.772 --> 02:15:29.353]  They're legal drug dealers!
[02:15:30.113 --> 02:15:34.755]  And they sell drugs, the meanest, baddest stuff Big Pharma can cook up.
[02:15:35.996 --> 02:15:43.139]  Look, I mean, if you were a legal drug dealer, and you were in competition with other legal drug dealers, you're gonna come up with the meanest magic you got.
[02:15:44.019 --> 02:15:49.041]  You're gonna come up with the most hardcore stuff you can imagine, the most addictive, the most controlling.
[02:15:50.357 --> 02:15:52.059]  They're just drug dealers.
[02:15:52.179 --> 02:15:58.384]  No different than somebody, but instead of the drug dealers going, you know, at the playground, at the fence, come here kid, I got something for you.
[02:15:58.845 --> 02:16:00.406]  They're in the schools pushing it.
[02:16:01.647 --> 02:16:06.872]  And then they'll SWAT team somebody's house looking for a cocaine or marijuana.
[02:16:06.932 --> 02:16:07.933]  I mean, it's a joke.
[02:16:08.814 --> 02:16:09.634]  Do you know that one?
[02:16:11.903 --> 02:16:15.065]  Uh, man, there's hundreds of them, and I've heard the term.
[02:16:15.705 --> 02:16:16.605]  Okay.
[02:16:16.805 --> 02:16:18.066]  I don't really know the specifics of it.
[02:16:18.266 --> 02:16:19.727]  Here, I'll just type it into Google right now.
[02:16:20.487 --> 02:16:21.487]  How do you spell Seroquel?
[02:16:22.108 --> 02:16:26.390]  It's S-E-R-O-Q-U-E-L.
[02:16:29.911 --> 02:16:29.991]  Okay.
[02:16:32.232 --> 02:16:33.593]  And I'm clicking it.
[02:16:33.993 --> 02:16:36.454]  Seroquel dot com.
[02:16:38.055 --> 02:16:39.876]  And we'll find out what it is.
[02:16:41.764 --> 02:16:52.848]  Yeah, if you've been diagnosed with bipolar and are looking for a treatment option, this is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, according to this.
[02:16:55.249 --> 02:16:57.010]  So, just another loving thing.
[02:16:59.231 --> 02:16:59.831]  Anything else, sir?
[02:17:00.691 --> 02:17:03.812]  No, that's my only point, and thanks for the good job.
[02:17:04.192 --> 02:17:08.054]  I saw Endgame, and I really thought that it was really good.
[02:17:09.173 --> 02:17:10.274]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[02:17:10.314 --> 02:17:11.355]  I appreciate your call.
[02:17:11.855 --> 02:17:15.298]  Yeah, when you make a film like Endgame, your only hope and dream is that people see it.
[02:17:16.618 --> 02:17:19.781]  And if people are going to see Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, that's up to you.
[02:17:20.501 --> 02:17:21.682]  The ball is in your court.
[02:17:21.742 --> 02:17:22.523]  You've got the ball.
[02:17:24.044 --> 02:17:24.824]  It's all up to you.
[02:17:25.745 --> 02:17:27.406]  If you take action, you're unstoppable.
[02:17:28.987 --> 02:17:30.088]  If you ask for God's guidance.
[02:17:31.149 --> 02:17:37.794]  If you take action, if you turn your power loose, if you just unleash
[02:17:38.729 --> 02:17:39.970]  Then the New World Order will fall.
[02:17:40.090 --> 02:17:40.911]  It will pay.
[02:17:40.971 --> 02:17:41.811]  It will be destroyed.
[02:17:41.831 --> 02:17:42.612]  It will be defeated.
[02:17:46.375 --> 02:17:50.037]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:17:50.438 --> 02:17:55.862]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:17:56.322 --> 02:17:57.403]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:17:57.443 --> 02:18:01.486]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:18:02.126 --> 02:18:15.451]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:18:15.931 --> 02:18:21.253]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:18:21.534 --> 02:18:27.436]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:18:28.176 --> 02:18:29.438]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:29.458 --> 02:18:31.159]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[02:18:31.179 --> 02:18:31.540]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:33.641]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:18:33.661 --> 02:18:33.722]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:45.643 --> 02:18:48.664]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:18:48.964 --> 02:18:53.906]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:18:54.146 --> 02:18:58.488]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:18:58.808 --> 02:19:07.712]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:19:07.932 --> 02:19:11.533]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:19:11.833 --> 02:19:16.859]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:23.908]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:24.929]  What about you?
[02:19:25.663 --> 02:19:31.006]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:19:46.174 --> 02:19:49.136]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.456 --> 02:19:58.480]  Did you know that the Lenin School of Political Warfare has laid down a plan for a third world war that will destroy both Christianity and Communism at the same time?
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:04.703]  From the rubbles of this war, the Illuminati will establish their world government, prophesied in Revelation chapter 13.
[02:20:06.135 --> 02:20:16.171]  Communism said they would pretend to collapse, and when America had begun to disarm, the combined communist world would launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists.
[02:20:16.940 --> 02:20:24.126]  We'd like to show you how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:20:24.806 --> 02:20:26.267]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:26.287 --> 02:20:27.428]  That's 1-800-516-8736 to request your subscription.
[02:20:27.448 --> 02:20:28.109]  Call now.
[02:20:28.129 --> 02:20:30.691]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:44.119 --> 02:20:45.600]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.
[02:20:45.961 --> 02:20:51.465]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[02:20:51.945 --> 02:20:59.892]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[02:21:00.392 --> 02:21:03.995]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs.
[02:21:04.295 --> 02:21:04.635]  I think so.
[02:21:34.219 --> 02:21:37.922]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[02:21:38.742 --> 02:21:42.865]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[02:21:47.348 --> 02:22:02.818]  The last caller brought up one of his friends who was put on Seroquel, so I just clicked
[02:22:04.338 --> 02:22:06.880]  Information that you need to know on their page.
[02:22:06.900 --> 02:22:08.122]  Let me go to the actual link.
[02:22:08.182 --> 02:22:10.664]  It says, important safety information.
[02:22:10.684 --> 02:22:25.737]  And it says, elderly patients, this is what it first says, with dementia related psychosis, this is a psychological pill, it isn't, it isn't, it goes on to say, treated with this type of medicine are at an increased risk of death.
[02:22:26.858 --> 02:22:31.282]  Next line, antidepressants have an increased risk of suicidal thoughts.
[02:22:32.085 --> 02:22:33.186]  That's an oxymoron.
[02:22:33.406 --> 02:22:37.910]  Antidepressants have increased the risk of suicidal thoughts.
[02:22:39.932 --> 02:22:40.292]  Period.
[02:22:40.892 --> 02:22:43.074]  Antidepressants have increased the risk of suicidal thoughts.
[02:22:43.094 --> 02:22:44.235]  Thought they were antidepressants.
[02:22:44.816 --> 02:22:45.596]  And actions.
[02:22:46.357 --> 02:22:49.680]  Suicidal thoughts and actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults.
[02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:57.706]  Parents of all ages starting treatment should be watched closely for worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts, or actions.
[02:22:59.468 --> 02:23:00.288]  Agitations.
[02:23:00.388 --> 02:23:01.029]  Irritability.
[02:23:01.764 --> 02:23:06.167]  You mean going into a mall and shooting a bunch of people or putting the baby in the microwave?
[02:23:06.228 --> 02:23:07.448]  It does it to adults, too.
[02:23:08.970 --> 02:23:16.475]  But you add adolescent hormones and the rest of it in there and you get these type of nightmares.
[02:23:17.456 --> 02:23:24.542]  Meanwhile, they got people like Dr. Dina Dell all day dis-info-ing, pulling out propaganda, demonizing supplements.
[02:23:24.782 --> 02:23:26.843]  And there are some supplements out there that are bold.
[02:23:26.863 --> 02:23:28.104]  There's some stuff that doesn't do what it says.
[02:23:28.445 --> 02:23:28.845]  But, I mean,
[02:23:29.685 --> 02:23:31.126]  The point is, this is ancient medicine.
[02:23:31.146 --> 02:23:33.709]  There's all sorts of things they admit have treatments.
[02:23:34.069 --> 02:23:38.433]  You know, hemp is good for glaucoma and stomach aches, and they used to say it wasn't.
[02:23:38.473 --> 02:23:41.135]  Now they prescribe it for thousands of different illnesses.
[02:23:42.136 --> 02:23:43.578]  The point is, they say that doesn't exist.
[02:23:43.638 --> 02:23:45.159]  Oh, but that's all bad.
[02:23:45.239 --> 02:23:51.445]  We need to give you something that kills you or makes you commit suicide or want to kill other people for your depression.
[02:23:51.485 --> 02:23:52.586]  It makes you depressed, though.
[02:23:54.868 --> 02:23:56.009]  But when you get depressed,
[02:23:57.223 --> 02:23:59.546]  You've been on it a while, and it always happens.
[02:23:59.586 --> 02:24:00.446]  It just takes longer.
[02:24:00.527 --> 02:24:02.909]  It might take two years, it might take a month, it might take five years.
[02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:07.473]  But it always takes more, more, more, and then finally you turn into Mr. Psychopath.
[02:24:09.535 --> 02:24:19.165]  Speaking of alternative health, Arthlin at 321relief.com is just a cocktail
[02:24:20.805 --> 02:24:30.929]  And you can go to their website of well-known, well-documented anti-inflammatories that in medical studies and alternative studies, but also mainline medical studies, have had a big effect.
[02:24:31.952 --> 02:24:33.672]  I mean, one of the things is ginger, folks.
[02:24:33.772 --> 02:24:36.353]  Everybody knows ginger, or should know, that just fresh ginger.
[02:24:36.393 --> 02:24:40.154]  But the point is, it's got frankincense and just a whole bunch of other things in it.
[02:24:40.614 --> 02:24:42.654]  Check it out at 321relief.com.
[02:24:42.734 --> 02:24:44.034]  321relief.com.
[02:24:44.475 --> 02:24:45.995]  They'll probably try to ban it or something.
[02:24:46.015 --> 02:24:48.835]  They'll probably try to, you know, ban gingerbread men next.
[02:24:48.875 --> 02:24:49.976]  But 321relief.com.
[02:24:50.016 --> 02:24:50.516]  321relief.com.
[02:24:50.556 --> 02:24:50.676]  Or 877-327-0365.
[02:24:50.696 --> 02:24:50.996]  Arthlin.
[02:24:57.583 --> 02:25:19.411]  And it's for arthritis and inflammation, and it's got all sorts of stuff out of particular African bush, and it's got Cypress, Sarconosilis, and I went and looked it up, and it's mainline and anti-inflammatory, and Zingibar, it's a bunch of interesting stuff in there.
[02:25:19.431 --> 02:25:19.731]  So 877-327-0365, 321relief.com.
[02:25:24.858 --> 02:25:31.044]  But see, the difference between the alternative health people is they don't go into schools at gunpoint and make the children go on the drugs.
[02:25:31.864 --> 02:25:33.066]  And they're not pitching drugs.
[02:25:33.186 --> 02:25:35.288]  They're pitching natural compounds.
[02:25:36.268 --> 02:25:44.416]  But Big Pharma likes to take all the petrochemicals they have and produce these different molecular nightmares and try to force them
[02:25:45.934 --> 02:25:47.055]  On the population.
[02:25:47.655 --> 02:25:56.801]  And I challenge you to show me one of these mass shootings where they weren't on serotonin reuptake inhibitors, generally comboed with Ritalin or other amphetamine-type drugs.
[02:25:56.841 --> 02:25:58.202]  This guy was reportedly on both.
[02:25:58.262 --> 02:26:01.084]  He was on, quote, antidepressants and Ritalin.
[02:26:02.705 --> 02:26:06.007]  And he did what the insert says it would do.
[02:26:06.807 --> 02:26:09.689]  I don't know how all these parents, you know, of course you're teenagers acting up.
[02:26:09.709 --> 02:26:10.450]  They all do that.
[02:26:11.530 --> 02:26:13.131]  Of course that happens in youth.
[02:26:13.251 --> 02:26:14.192]  The trials of youth.
[02:26:15.063 --> 02:26:25.530]  And you're going to go through some crises, you're going to go through some problems, but just throwing your kid on Happy Pills, maybe they're drinking four or five cokes a day and eating popsicles and sugar-covered garbage.
[02:26:26.431 --> 02:26:27.491]  Maybe they're not in shape.
[02:26:27.691 --> 02:26:29.252]  Maybe they're hanging out with bad friends.
[02:26:29.713 --> 02:26:33.355]  Maybe they got on other illegal drugs, which can lead to this.
[02:26:33.935 --> 02:26:35.096]  I mean, they're not good either.
[02:26:35.817 --> 02:26:43.662]  And now you're just going to put them on Ritalin and Prozac, and the suicides are in the thousands.
[02:26:44.671 --> 02:26:47.954]  The suicides are in the thousands every year caused by this.
[02:26:47.994 --> 02:26:48.815]  They've had to admit it.
[02:26:49.115 --> 02:26:59.405]  And Prozac in its early trials in 1981-82, it came out that there was a 15 times increase in that study of suicide and they suppressed that.
[02:27:01.247 --> 02:27:02.588]  15 times increase!
[02:27:03.829 --> 02:27:09.595]  And that wasn't just in the general public, that was in control groups in those taking placebo versus the drug.
[02:27:11.317 --> 02:27:13.898]  All right, we're out of time on that subject.
[02:27:14.459 --> 02:27:23.963]  We are scheduled to have Robert Baer, one of the most prestigious, you could say, or most highly decorated CIA field officers in modern history.
[02:27:23.983 --> 02:27:26.905]  The movie Syriana was based on a book he wrote, and a lot more.
[02:27:26.925 --> 02:27:31.567]  He's got a new book coming out, and he's an expert on Iran, so we should have him on the other side.
[02:27:31.967 --> 02:27:32.628]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.189 --> 02:27:37.130]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.570 --> 02:27:39.091]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.089 --> 02:27:42.991]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.274 --> 02:27:49.216]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:27:49.376 --> 02:27:54.540]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:27:54.901 --> 02:28:00.205]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:28:00.605 --> 02:28:01.706]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:28:02.086 --> 02:28:11.153]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:28:11.413 --> 02:28:13.014]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[02:28:13.255 --> 02:28:22.081]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[02:28:39.975 --> 02:28:41.036]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[02:28:46.969 --> 02:28:49.371]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:28:49.891 --> 02:28:53.213]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[02:28:53.573 --> 02:28:56.495]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[02:28:56.795 --> 02:29:03.159]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[02:29:03.239 --> 02:29:07.642]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[02:29:07.882 --> 02:29:12.224]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[02:29:12.365 --> 02:29:14.986]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[02:29:15.006 --> 02:29:17.767]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[02:29:18.228 --> 02:29:20.769]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[02:29:20.809 --> 02:29:25.071]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[02:29:25.131 --> 02:29:25.952]  Treasury bonds.
[02:29:26.252 --> 02:29:30.875]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[02:29:31.055 --> 02:29:32.696]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:29:32.716 --> 02:29:34.697]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:50.666]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:29:50.986 --> 02:29:52.868]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:29:53.068 --> 02:29:56.112]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:29:56.292 --> 02:29:59.415]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:29:59.736 --> 02:30:01.578]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:30:01.838 --> 02:30:05.540]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:08.481]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:30:08.501 --> 02:30:13.404]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:30:13.604 --> 02:30:17.846]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:30:18.286 --> 02:30:22.628]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[02:30:22.928 --> 02:30:27.190]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:30:27.530 --> 02:30:33.393]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[02:30:33.713 --> 02:30:36.134]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:30:36.334 --> 02:30:36.834]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:30:36.854 --> 02:30:37.955]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[02:30:51.827 --> 02:30:53.548]  Alright, my friends, we are live.
[02:30:53.568 --> 02:30:58.232]  It is the 6th day of December 2007.
[02:30:58.272 --> 02:31:03.356]  Hard to believe it's already Thursday and this year is almost over.
[02:31:03.896 --> 02:31:10.141]  If I spent any time on his bio, the 30 minutes we've got with him would be gone very quickly.
[02:31:10.201 --> 02:31:11.222]  He's Robert Baird.
[02:31:11.702 --> 02:31:13.964]  He wrote a best-selling book.
[02:31:14.665 --> 02:31:15.585]  We're good to go.
[02:31:38.411 --> 02:31:39.612]  Thanks for having me.
[02:31:39.632 --> 02:31:40.153]  It's a pleasure.
[02:32:07.240 --> 02:32:08.561]  You want to get into Iran first?
[02:32:08.581 --> 02:32:10.603]  You want to get into Syriana first?
[02:32:10.623 --> 02:32:11.563]  Or do you want to talk about your new book?
[02:32:11.583 --> 02:32:12.604]  I'm going to talk about Iran.
[02:32:12.624 --> 02:32:13.685]  It's really on my mind.
[02:32:13.725 --> 02:32:17.928]  Here's a country that has become the third rail of American politics.
[02:32:18.428 --> 02:32:21.870]  You touch it, and the President touches it, and he goes down.
[02:32:22.911 --> 02:32:27.014]  We've been hiding information from the public on Iran for 30 years.
[02:32:28.495 --> 02:32:34.179]  I'm not an advocate of going to war with Iran, but one of the things that's greatly disturbed me, getting to 9-11, is
[02:32:35.939 --> 02:32:41.923]  The evidence we had that Iran's participation in this was never given the 9-11 Commission Report.
[02:32:42.964 --> 02:32:47.367]  I'm not talking about, you know, conspiracy theories, I'm talking about good, hard intelligence.
[02:32:48.849 --> 02:33:01.238]  This latest turnaround on Iran's nuclear weapons, I don't know whether they've got nuclear weapons or not, or they're about ready to explode a bomb, but I can tell you this intelligence on Iran is completely politicized.
[02:33:02.719 --> 02:33:04.200]  What the President has told us
[02:33:05.177 --> 02:33:23.300]  In publishing this national intelligence estimate is, hey guys, I can't do Iran now, I can't send the Iowa National Guard in to cross the border into Iran, can't do it, don't have enough soldiers, I can't protect the oil, and I'm just going to postpone this, doing anything about Iran.
[02:33:23.540 --> 02:33:30.381]  Whether it's negotiating or taking out their nuclear sites, he's just sent, we're postponing this, the next guy can take care of it.
[02:33:30.921 --> 02:33:34.282]  And that's the underlying message, and as Americans we have to understand that.
[02:33:35.383 --> 02:33:43.149]  It's not because they've stopped their nuclear weapons program permanently, because I'm here to tell you that Iran wants the Gulf.
[02:33:43.669 --> 02:33:44.870]  It wants Saudi Arabia.
[02:33:44.890 --> 02:33:45.811]  It wants Bahrain.
[02:33:45.971 --> 02:33:46.972]  It wants the whole thing.
[02:33:46.992 --> 02:33:50.795]  You know, I'm getting this from a lot of insiders.
[02:33:51.595 --> 02:33:52.716]  I'm not anti-Iranian.
[02:33:52.756 --> 02:33:54.117]  I'm just saying this is what they're after.
[02:33:54.197 --> 02:34:00.562]  We're going to be dealing in a multipolar world where Iran is one of our rivals in a big way.
[02:34:01.736 --> 02:34:06.880]  Now, that's quite a statement you made, that this is political.
[02:34:06.980 --> 02:34:19.368]  I would think that the Office of Special Plans and the Niger Yellow Cake and the aluminum tubes, that that was politicized, cherry-picked, cooked-up intelligence.
[02:34:19.388 --> 02:34:25.632]  You're saying the CIA is putting out this report saying they abandoned their nuclear weapons program in 2003?
[02:34:26.713 --> 02:34:29.075]  You're saying that's baloney and you have proof?
[02:34:29.928 --> 02:34:33.210]  I would say that it's not a question of that, it's a question of the judgment.
[02:34:34.650 --> 02:34:39.452]  If you want to write one of these things in NIE, you can play both sides of it.
[02:34:39.472 --> 02:34:43.514]  You can say there's evidence they've stopped, and there's evidence they're going to continue.
[02:34:43.594 --> 02:34:47.576]  And it's the way you write these things, but the fact that it was made so public
[02:34:48.817 --> 02:34:50.098]  Is the political side to it.
[02:34:50.438 --> 02:35:00.762]  No, I understand that, but if Iran nukes Israel, or even if they got the weapon of the delivery system, Israel's got 400 plus nukes, and Iran's going to literally be a molten slag heap.
[02:35:01.402 --> 02:35:03.923]  Oh, absolutely, but that's not their goal.
[02:35:03.963 --> 02:35:04.983]  Their goal is to get Iraq.
[02:35:07.481 --> 02:35:12.042]  Lebanon, Syria, Bahrain, and the oil fields in Saudi Arabia.
[02:35:12.082 --> 02:35:12.222]  Why?
[02:35:12.242 --> 02:35:16.364]  Because there's a Persian belief that once they had that as part of their empire... Absolutely.
[02:35:16.384 --> 02:35:17.264]  You hit the nail on the head.
[02:35:17.304 --> 02:35:19.504]  They want this as part... They want the empire back.
[02:35:20.165 --> 02:35:21.625]  Call it Islamic if you want.
[02:35:22.285 --> 02:35:23.065]  They want it back.
[02:35:23.145 --> 02:35:28.827]  And having the oil fields is much more important to them than doing anything about Israel.
[02:35:29.007 --> 02:35:29.607]  Because you know what?
[02:35:29.627 --> 02:35:32.968]  The Iranians, at the end of the day, this is just all propaganda.
[02:35:33.008 --> 02:35:35.329]  Well, how are the Iranians going to go into Iraq, though?
[02:35:36.716 --> 02:35:40.118]  They already have Basra.
[02:35:40.678 --> 02:35:47.983]  They are smuggling most of the oil that's coming out of Iraq today is going through Basra and the profits are going into Iran.
[02:35:48.823 --> 02:35:50.364]  I talk to oil people all day every day.
[02:35:50.404 --> 02:35:51.965]  How much oil can you smuggle?
[02:35:52.785 --> 02:35:54.887]  They're smuggling almost, you know, we're talking about 100,000 barrels a day.
[02:35:58.038 --> 02:36:00.358]  Yeah, up to 200,000 a day.
[02:36:00.418 --> 02:36:09.120]  They're just basically taking, they're pumping it, they're smuggling it into Dubai, they're refining it, sending the refined gasoline into Iran, or they're selling it on the market.
[02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:11.041]  Well, let's go back to your other statement.
[02:36:12.641 --> 02:36:15.421]  Evidence linking Iran somehow to 9-11?
[02:36:15.581 --> 02:36:17.282]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:36:17.322 --> 02:36:19.382]  It's never been given the 9-11 Commission Report.
[02:36:19.402 --> 02:36:20.482]  Well, please give it to us!
[02:36:20.923 --> 02:36:21.383]  In June 1996,
[02:36:23.783 --> 02:36:31.089]  Osama Bin Laden sat down with an Iranian intelligence officer and they discussed a comprehensive plan to attack the United States.
[02:36:33.571 --> 02:36:35.512]  These meetings went on for several years.
[02:36:35.692 --> 02:36:40.876]  What disturbs me is that that evidence is not weighed inside the 9-11.
[02:36:40.916 --> 02:36:41.897]  What's the proof of that?
[02:36:41.917 --> 02:36:43.098]  I mean, where's the proof?
[02:36:43.759 --> 02:36:45.380]  Well, the intelligence community has it.
[02:36:46.621 --> 02:36:48.802]  But they just never gave it to the 9-11 Commission.
[02:36:48.822 --> 02:36:51.925]  So we have a Sunni working with the Shiites?
[02:36:52.803 --> 02:36:57.228]  Anything, because in the Middle East, keep in mind, it's my enemy's enemy is my friend.
[02:36:58.790 --> 02:37:01.913]  And that is a rule, it's an ironclad rule.
[02:37:03.455 --> 02:37:11.644]  You know, and especially when we're so militarily dominant, that Iran is not afraid to ally with anybody.
[02:37:11.704 --> 02:37:13.466]  When I was in Lebanon in the 80s and 90s,
[02:37:14.899 --> 02:37:19.582]  The Iranians were allied with a Christian group, the Lebanese forces.
[02:37:19.602 --> 02:37:21.083]  I mean, it's just totally unlikely.
[02:37:21.103 --> 02:37:24.525]  It goes against the understanding we have of the Middle East.
[02:37:25.646 --> 02:37:30.629]  But they look at themselves as militarily inferior, and they'll ally with anybody.
[02:37:31.089 --> 02:37:33.691]  I'm not saying... I don't do conspiracy theories.
[02:37:33.731 --> 02:37:34.931]  I'm not saying they were part of 9-11.
[02:37:35.071 --> 02:37:37.653]  I'm just saying this evidence was never weighed.
[02:37:38.516 --> 02:37:48.100]  Okay, let me shift gears, because I want to spend some time on your new book, and before you leave, tell us what you would do about Iran, or what you think, I mean, from your perspective, what policy should be.
[02:37:48.881 --> 02:37:53.443]  But getting back to your new book, Blow the House Down, before we talk about that,
[02:37:54.083 --> 02:37:56.164]  I have this Tom Hartman clip.
[02:37:56.184 --> 02:37:57.504]  It's only about 30 seconds long.
[02:37:57.524 --> 02:38:00.446]  I want to play this and then you can follow up with the question.
[02:38:00.486 --> 02:38:08.989]  I'd like you to follow up and expand because I was talking, you know, during the break and you said, well, you have a nuanced view on this that we don't know what's really going on with 9-11.
[02:38:09.289 --> 02:38:10.970]  And I want to, you know, flesh that out with you.
[02:38:10.990 --> 02:38:11.670]  But here's that clip.
[02:38:12.370 --> 02:38:14.211]  So are you just, you know,
[02:38:15.006 --> 02:38:16.107]  Personally of the opinion.
[02:38:16.147 --> 02:38:26.175]  I mean, obviously you can't speak for the CIA or your previous activities with the agency, but are you of the opinion that there was an aspect of inside job to 9-11 within the U.S.
[02:38:26.195 --> 02:38:26.515]  government?
[02:38:27.556 --> 02:38:28.717]  There's that possibility.
[02:38:28.757 --> 02:38:29.978]  The evidence points at it.
[02:38:31.179 --> 02:38:32.660]  And why is it not being investigated?
[02:38:34.501 --> 02:38:37.324]  Why isn't the WMD story being investigated?
[02:38:37.524 --> 02:38:40.786]  Why hasn't anybody been held accountable for 9-11?
[02:38:42.415 --> 02:38:45.158]  I mean, you know, we held people accountable after Pearl Harbor.
[02:38:45.178 --> 02:38:49.003]  I mean, you know, why has there been no change of command?
[02:38:49.083 --> 02:38:51.245]  Why has there been no political repercussions?
[02:38:51.846 --> 02:38:57.993]  Why has there been no, um, any sort of exposure on this?
[02:38:58.433 --> 02:38:59.595]  It really makes you wonder.
[02:39:01.096 --> 02:39:03.079]  Mr. Bair, can you expand on that statement?
[02:39:03.876 --> 02:39:04.477]  Absolutely.
[02:39:05.337 --> 02:39:16.723]  The problem we have is, goes back to the 9-11 Commission Report, we now have the current Minister of Interior in Doha, the state of Qatar, who protected Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[02:39:18.524 --> 02:39:29.570]  We also have, there's several Americans that could have grabbed Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in 1996 when he was in Doha, who are now working for that government.
[02:39:30.251 --> 02:39:36.397]  There's been no explanation of how he got away, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9-11.
[02:39:36.918 --> 02:39:42.243]  There's been no explanation why these American officials went to work for the same man, the Minister of Interior.
[02:39:43.144 --> 02:39:45.646]  And including, let's face this, Rudy Giuliani.
[02:39:46.267 --> 02:39:52.052]  He has an enormous amount of contracts in Doha today with the same guy who protected Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[02:39:52.853 --> 02:39:53.574]  As a citizen,
[02:39:54.275 --> 02:40:09.922]  Now, speaking as a citizen, since I was not in the CIA at 9-11, I'd like to know what are those connections, and why is the Minister of Interior still in power, and he's given us no explanation of why he tipped off Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in 1996, who went on to do 9-11.
[02:40:09.962 --> 02:40:12.243]  I mean, doesn't that disturb you?
[02:40:12.544 --> 02:40:13.084]  Well, it does.
[02:40:13.244 --> 02:40:19.227]  Why didn't, um, why has there been an investigation and submitted, New York Times, Washington Post, BBC,
[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:38.773]  That the head of Pakistani ISI wired $100,000 in the month before 9-11 to the supposedly hijacker Mohammed Adda, and then for the second trip in his life, the head of Pakistani intelligence, General Mahmood Ahmed, is meeting with all the heads of intelligence in a week-long trip leading up to the attack.
[02:40:39.434 --> 02:40:46.659]  Exactly, and I'm speaking as an American citizen, not as an official, and I'd like to know, and it disturbs me that these questions are not answered.
[02:40:46.879 --> 02:40:47.920]  We're not talking about
[02:40:48.729 --> 02:40:54.054]  Some top secret intelligence system that's going to be sources and methods that are going to be exposed.
[02:40:54.434 --> 02:40:55.235]  I just want answers.
[02:40:55.675 --> 02:40:56.396]  I want answers.
[02:40:56.796 --> 02:41:00.420]  What happened to the Iranian relationship with Osama Bin Laden?
[02:41:01.501 --> 02:41:04.263]  Why is the Minister of Interior in Doha still in place?
[02:41:04.804 --> 02:41:09.208]  Why have the Pakistanis been unable to get near Osama Bin Laden?
[02:41:09.288 --> 02:41:10.188]  Who's he hiding with?
[02:41:11.109 --> 02:41:15.013]  It's either just total incompetence on the part of our government
[02:41:15.862 --> 02:41:16.763]  Or a conspiracy.
[02:41:16.803 --> 02:41:25.873]  Have you heard the latest report that the fellow that made Super Size Me, it looks like has actually gotten a meeting with Bin Laden?
[02:41:26.634 --> 02:41:33.421]  Variety is now reporting that quote, they got the Holy Grail and the Weinsteins bought it and they're leaking that supposedly they've got Bin Laden.
[02:41:35.453 --> 02:41:41.214]  It's just amazing, and you know, what I don't want is the average American to lose confidence in his government.
[02:41:41.795 --> 02:41:46.116]  Because ultimately, we depend upon our government, and ultimately the government's benign.
[02:41:46.596 --> 02:41:53.557]  But by not answering these questions, we're leaving open, you know, actually nutty conspiracy theories.
[02:41:54.618 --> 02:41:56.438]  Mr. Baird, what does it look like to you?
[02:41:57.279 --> 02:42:02.902]  When you've got, and this is confirmed, Associated Press, Newsweek Magazine, I've talked to the officers involved.
[02:42:03.182 --> 02:42:06.604]  Mohammed Atta was trained at the Defense Language School, Monterey, California.
[02:42:06.984 --> 02:42:09.645]  In the year before 9-11, the dean of the school went public.
[02:42:10.025 --> 02:42:11.446]  Then they threatened him with court-martial.
[02:42:11.906 --> 02:42:12.626]  Colonel Butler.
[02:42:13.487 --> 02:42:15.208]  They were trained at all these bases.
[02:42:15.248 --> 02:42:19.350]  You've got the Nick Berg that got his head sawed off, reportedly in Iraq.
[02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:22.891]  Laptop gets borrowed by the hijackers.
[02:42:23.231 --> 02:42:23.772]  I mean, come on!
[02:42:24.612 --> 02:42:25.413]  I've interviewed U.S.
[02:42:25.473 --> 02:42:35.281]  Embassy heads who were ordered to let the hijackers back in from their Malaysian terror summit, and were told, oh no, the terror designation on the computer is their CIA cover.
[02:42:36.482 --> 02:42:36.742]  I know!
[02:42:36.842 --> 02:42:37.803]  I mean, we know this.
[02:42:37.823 --> 02:42:43.568]  I mean, these guys were caught with a man who was indicted, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in Malaysia, meeting.
[02:42:44.088 --> 02:42:45.829]  We knew they were on their way to the United States.
[02:42:46.390 --> 02:42:51.374]  No one did anything, and there's been no accountability for these people.
[02:42:51.394 --> 02:42:52.815]  What does this look like to you in your gut?
[02:42:52.855 --> 02:42:53.756]  What does it look like to you?
[02:42:54.649 --> 02:42:58.751]  As an average American citizen, it looks like to me that something's being covered up.
[02:43:00.212 --> 02:43:02.814]  Either for incompetence, or for whatever reason.
[02:43:03.414 --> 02:43:09.617]  Now, on the other hand, my newest position is, I've been in the middle of conspiracies for years, and you can never carry them out.
[02:43:10.058 --> 02:43:12.599]  But the point is, we have to address these questions.
[02:43:12.719 --> 02:43:13.259]  We have to.
[02:43:13.279 --> 02:43:14.520]  There has to be accountability.
[02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:21.324]  There has to be people who lose their jobs, that are pointed out as having made mistakes.
[02:43:21.684 --> 02:43:23.625]  But you know, it's much worse than you think.
[02:43:24.164 --> 02:43:25.565]  Do you remember who Abu Zubaydah is?
[02:43:26.005 --> 02:43:26.265]  Yes.
[02:43:26.285 --> 02:43:27.265]  Alright.
[02:43:28.446 --> 02:43:36.409]  I know the guy who went into the safe house, grabbed him, there was the shootout, he was wounded, they pulled him out of the car, right?
[02:43:36.869 --> 02:43:41.931]  This isn't second-hand, this is first-hand information.
[02:43:42.591 --> 02:43:44.672]  They pull out of his pocket two credit cards.
[02:43:45.372 --> 02:43:47.453]  One goes to Saudi Arabia, one goes to Kuwait.
[02:43:48.414 --> 02:43:51.415]  The other thing they found in his safe house is cell phone bills.
[02:43:52.233 --> 02:43:55.356]  Uh, that went up until 10 September, calls to the United States.
[02:43:56.477 --> 02:44:04.723]  The calls resumed on the 16th of September, and the CIA sent those calls in to the FBI, and you know where those bills are now?
[02:44:06.224 --> 02:44:06.585]  Lost.
[02:44:07.605 --> 02:44:12.950]  Well, what about FBI agents that say they don't want to know how to land or take off, just how to fly a plane?
[02:44:13.330 --> 02:44:18.174]  We think they want to fly them to the World Trade Center, and they're told, shut up, you're off the case, over and over again.
[02:44:18.594 --> 02:44:20.075]  Those guys got fired, or demoted.
[02:44:20.436 --> 02:44:20.596]  Yeah.
[02:44:22.338 --> 02:44:24.423]  These are the kind of questions we need to answer.
[02:44:24.463 --> 02:44:27.491]  Where are those cell phone bills that were picked up in Faisalabad?
[02:44:27.952 --> 02:44:29.015]  And who was he calling?
[02:44:30.484 --> 02:44:34.445]  Well, Mr. Mayor, here's the bigger question.
[02:44:34.806 --> 02:44:35.726]  Who has the motive?
[02:44:35.766 --> 02:44:40.868]  You've certainly heard about the Republican memos that are now public where they're saying we need another 9-11.
[02:44:41.148 --> 02:44:42.448]  That would help our agenda.
[02:44:42.668 --> 02:44:50.131]  Then they openly write editorials in the Philadelphia News about how great 9-11 was for America to unify us and how great another one would be.
[02:44:50.491 --> 02:44:53.432]  We have the PNAC document saying minus a huge catalyzing
[02:44:53.852 --> 02:44:55.713]  That's what I would like to know, wouldn't you?
[02:45:16.144 --> 02:45:18.566]  Well, Kermit Roosevelt admits they did.
[02:45:18.626 --> 02:45:27.213]  And the only way you can get away with it, you know, is to expose the facts into the public and let the public make up their minds.
[02:45:29.575 --> 02:45:36.120]  And I don't want to fuel conspiracy theories, but you know, sitting back in Colorado, I want answers.
[02:45:37.719 --> 02:45:41.501]  I don't want people to tell me, don't worry about it, my government's taking care of me.
[02:45:41.541 --> 02:45:49.484]  There's too many connections that I know about personally from intelligence I've seen that have not been answered that I want answered.
[02:45:52.305 --> 02:45:59.608]  Well, you talk about fueling conspiracy theories, but isn't the establishment fueling them by all these facts being out there and they just say it doesn't exist?
[02:46:00.228 --> 02:46:00.749]  Absolutely.
[02:46:00.789 --> 02:46:02.829]  And it's Republican and Democrat alike.
[02:46:02.910 --> 02:46:03.910]  It's bipartisan.
[02:46:05.047 --> 02:46:06.229]  I mean, you know,
[02:46:19.961 --> 02:46:20.941]  What's been covered up?
[02:46:21.342 --> 02:46:22.222]  What's been hidden?
[02:46:22.342 --> 02:46:23.343]  And we want answers.
[02:46:23.703 --> 02:46:25.284]  What do you know about Operation Gladio?
[02:46:25.364 --> 02:46:32.748]  Because Francisco Cosca, the former Italian president, former head of their intelligence, of course went public and said the government with the U.S.
[02:46:32.788 --> 02:46:35.910]  elements staged bombings there to blame it on leftists and communists.
[02:46:36.291 --> 02:46:43.495]  Now he's gone public in Italy's biggest paper saying that 9-11 was carried out by the United States and Israel.
[02:46:44.890 --> 02:46:49.115]  You know, it's one of those things that are getting traction.
[02:46:50.276 --> 02:46:54.200]  And I'm hoping that the explanations are simpler than that.
[02:46:54.881 --> 02:46:57.524]  But what we don't want is our government to treat us like idiots.
[02:46:58.825 --> 02:46:59.967]  Otherwise we are going to...
[02:47:00.879 --> 02:47:07.763]  Now, your new book, Blow the House Down, obviously you can't write books about real things that happen with the real names.
[02:47:08.163 --> 02:47:13.665]  I mean, I've heard you on NPR say that Syriana was a couple different real things that happened, mixed together with a name change.
[02:47:13.986 --> 02:47:15.206]  What is Blow the House Down?
[02:47:15.246 --> 02:47:22.450]  Because it's described on Amazon as getting into an alternative theory and history of 9-11 attacks.
[02:47:24.451 --> 02:47:29.293]  It's a way of getting at the story, offering a possibility of what happened.
[02:47:31.603 --> 02:47:32.203]  Look at Iran.
[02:47:32.503 --> 02:47:33.444]  Here's my problem.
[02:47:33.644 --> 02:47:36.024]  I had two bosses were killed by the Iranians.
[02:47:37.505 --> 02:47:43.087]  I've seen evidence, and I'm not talking conspiracy theories, that the Iranians were involved in Pan Am 103.
[02:47:43.887 --> 02:47:45.847]  I just know too much about it from the inside.
[02:47:46.388 --> 02:47:49.529]  That was completely, the information was flush.
[02:47:49.549 --> 02:47:53.870]  It wasn't even given to the FBI, this information, and it was very, very good.
[02:47:56.151 --> 02:48:00.812]  And now all of a sudden, you've got the Bush administration saying, hey, we're going to give Iran a pass.
[02:48:03.001 --> 02:48:10.930]  You've got the head of Hezbollah, who's directly involved in blowing our embassy up, Beirut, 20 years ago, 24 years ago.
[02:48:12.071 --> 02:48:12.952]  That's never come out.
[02:48:13.072 --> 02:48:14.894]  And you just go on and on and on.
[02:48:15.234 --> 02:48:21.421]  And so what I do in this fictional account of it is, this is the way the world, you know, could it work this way?
[02:48:21.902 --> 02:48:23.924]  I can't prove it, but you know, there it is.
[02:48:25.203 --> 02:48:30.166]  Stay there, I want to hear more about Blow the House Down with Robert Baer on the other side of this quick break.
[02:48:30.567 --> 02:48:39.733]  Final segment, ladies and gentlemen, is straight ahead, right here on the GCN Radio Network with Robert Baer, famous CIA field commander.
[02:48:46.418 --> 02:48:47.798]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:47.818 --> 02:48:49.900]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.646 --> 02:48:54.868]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:55.529 --> 02:48:57.670]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:58.350 --> 02:49:00.612]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.152 --> 02:49:03.593]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.334 --> 02:49:11.678]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.679 --> 02:49:19.683]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.143 --> 02:49:23.626]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:23.986 --> 02:49:26.508]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world, doesn't he?
[02:49:26.568 --> 02:49:27.709]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.729 --> 02:49:28.449]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.469 --> 02:49:29.590]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.770 --> 02:49:30.511]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.531 --> 02:49:31.652]  That's what they're after, you see.
[02:49:31.912 --> 02:49:36.475]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:49:40.218 --> 02:49:42.940]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:44.641]  You have been warned.
[02:49:45.702 --> 02:49:48.584]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:49:48.924 --> 02:49:51.806]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:49:52.026 --> 02:49:58.231]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:49:58.611 --> 02:50:05.916]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:50:06.096 --> 02:50:10.219]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[02:50:10.459 --> 02:50:16.002]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[02:50:16.202 --> 02:50:29.310]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[02:50:29.510 --> 02:50:33.332]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Food and Places U.S.A.
[02:50:33.532 --> 02:50:38.055]  now for only $29 plus shipping and handling by calling New Millennium at
[02:50:38.915 --> 02:50:39.216]  We're good.
[02:50:45.669 --> 02:50:47.510]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:50:47.650 --> 02:50:52.832]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:50:52.992 --> 02:50:54.353]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:50:54.613 --> 02:51:02.797]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:51:02.997 --> 02:51:08.799]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:51:08.919 --> 02:51:10.680]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:12.881]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:51:13.041 --> 02:51:17.286]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:51:17.446 --> 02:51:19.609]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:51:19.689 --> 02:51:27.477]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:51:27.978 --> 02:51:28.459]  We're good to go.
[02:51:51.980 --> 02:52:11.304]  Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, you can still order in time for Christmas all the books and documentaries we carry online at PrisonPlanet.com or TruthNews.us, in-game blueprint for global enslavement, their own official statements, their own documents, their own memoirs, how they're setting up the North American Union, and how world government is a means to an end.
[02:52:11.324 --> 02:52:16.885]  We're talking to Robert Baer, who's agreed to come on in the next few months for a longer period of time, as we can hear about all of his
[02:52:17.791 --> 02:52:18.212]  Yes, we are.
[02:52:39.802 --> 02:52:43.444]  And an alternate view from the establishment view of what happened on 9-11.
[02:52:43.765 --> 02:52:49.428]  But speaking of prison planet, look at how the establishment has used the War on Terror to set up a police state.
[02:52:50.249 --> 02:53:04.138]  Bush in PDD 51, I don't know if you've seen that Mr. Bear, says now that he's above Congress and continual government in the Defense Authorization Act, they have funding for dealing with domestic insurgencies for the first time in modern history.
[02:53:04.158 --> 02:53:08.981]  I mean, what do you think about the climate of the police state, or do you think that we're not entering one?
[02:53:09.875 --> 02:53:10.896]  Oh, I think we're definitely on it.
[02:53:10.936 --> 02:53:13.497]  I mean, you know, search and seizure, you don't need a warrant anymore.
[02:53:13.517 --> 02:53:13.997]  We know that.
[02:53:16.518 --> 02:53:19.800]  Every day we're being warned there's going to be an attack and there isn't one.
[02:53:20.340 --> 02:53:24.362]  And so much information is being kept from us.
[02:53:24.382 --> 02:53:29.065]  I mean, Bush said that he just found out about this Iranian stuff last week.
[02:53:29.185 --> 02:53:30.065]  Well, that's nonsense.
[02:53:30.105 --> 02:53:35.668]  You don't find this stuff out from, apparently it's from telephone intercepts, and don't tell the President.
[02:53:38.355 --> 02:53:50.241]  You can't have a government that's fundamentally dishonest with the American people, and then change the laws, and not have people lose confidence, as both the Republicans and the Democrats have.
[02:53:51.862 --> 02:53:53.482]  The climate's terrible.
[02:53:54.223 --> 02:54:00.006]  Well, I've been watching even diplomatic programs on C-SPAN, where the diplomats are admitting that the U.S.
[02:54:00.026 --> 02:54:03.407]  has never lost its soft power like it has now.
[02:54:03.427 --> 02:54:04.988]  They're talking about it being gone, Robert.
[02:54:05.695 --> 02:54:06.276]  Oh, I think it is.
[02:54:06.316 --> 02:54:07.498]  I think the world's changed.
[02:54:07.899 --> 02:54:10.103]  The world has completely changed and you get used to it.
[02:54:13.008 --> 02:54:18.719]  We are quickly losing our power and our ability and our moral ascendancy as well.
[02:54:19.389 --> 02:54:23.073]  Which we depended upon, and which did us so well for so many years.
[02:54:23.373 --> 02:54:26.115]  Did they use daily and weekly terror alerts?
[02:54:26.496 --> 02:54:33.683]  I mean, they've admitted they have, but your take on them using it as a political tool and really blowing their credibility, or is that an accurate statement?
[02:54:34.183 --> 02:54:35.284]  No, they've blown their credibility.
[02:54:35.724 --> 02:54:40.008]  I mean, you know, we got the President talking in October about World War III with Iran,
[02:54:41.090 --> 02:54:45.511]  And then in the course of six weeks, it's completely changed and say that it's a benign power, Iran.
[02:54:45.571 --> 02:54:46.551]  Let's not worry about it.
[02:54:46.991 --> 02:54:50.932]  What would happen if there was a precipitous event in the next few months?
[02:54:51.252 --> 02:54:53.692]  A terror attack or one of our interests was hit?
[02:54:54.012 --> 02:54:58.733]  I mean, do you think Iran would do something like that and bring the wrath of the U.S.
[02:54:58.793 --> 02:54:59.033]  in?
[02:54:59.073 --> 02:55:00.874]  Or do you think somebody else would do something?
[02:55:01.394 --> 02:55:02.314]  I think they've already won.
[02:55:03.514 --> 02:55:04.574]  I'm writing a book on Iran.
[02:55:04.614 --> 02:55:05.295]  I think they've won.
[02:55:05.895 --> 02:55:07.695]  I mean, I just think we're going to be facing
[02:55:08.730 --> 02:55:16.532]  A new Tehran, and we better not hope they're as malicious as they claim to be.
[02:55:16.712 --> 02:55:23.253]  You say Iran has won, Pax Americana, Anglo-American, US-Israel-England has lost.
[02:55:23.813 --> 02:55:30.255]  Couldn't somebody in the neocon camp stage a provocateur or allow something to happen to get us back in the game?
[02:55:30.962 --> 02:55:37.264]  Yeah, I mean, the only way you're going to get back in the game is if we re-impose the draft, we put a million soldiers in Iraq, in the Gulf.
[02:55:37.744 --> 02:55:39.065]  That's the only way we're getting back in the game.
[02:55:39.245 --> 02:55:44.446]  But if there was another terror attack, couldn't that be the... That's the only way you're going to do it.
[02:55:44.767 --> 02:55:48.288]  Otherwise, what would it mean we're spending a trillion dollars a year in Iraq?
[02:55:48.668 --> 02:55:54.430]  Let's be clear, you're saying without another terror attack, the agenda to invade or attack Iran is dead?
[02:55:55.110 --> 02:55:55.610]  Absolutely.
[02:55:56.630 --> 02:55:58.071]  So who would launch that terror attack?
[02:55:58.750 --> 02:56:00.192]  Well, use your imagination.
[02:56:02.194 --> 02:56:03.355]  Whose interest is it in?
[02:56:03.856 --> 02:56:06.379]  It's in Saudi Arabia's interest, for instance.
[02:56:06.539 --> 02:56:08.001]  Because they're enemies with Iran?
[02:56:08.441 --> 02:56:11.885]  Yeah, so who's going to protect them against Iran unless there's an attack in this country?
[02:56:12.145 --> 02:56:13.467]  Ooh, I never thought of that!
[02:56:13.507 --> 02:56:14.628]  I never thought of that!
[02:56:15.269 --> 02:56:18.753]  Started a war against Islamo-fascism to aim them at Iran.
[02:56:19.765 --> 02:56:23.611]  Yeah, that's what exactly the Gulf countries want us to do, is go to war with Iran.
[02:56:24.032 --> 02:56:24.572]  Amazing!
