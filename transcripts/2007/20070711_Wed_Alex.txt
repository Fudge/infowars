[00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:10.037]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:11.478]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:13.139]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.641]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:22.084]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:33.874]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:33.995 --> 00:00:34.255]  Welcome.
[00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:39.677]  It is the 11th day of July 2007, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:57.344]  We're also going to have wide open phones.
[00:00:58.385 --> 00:01:06.472]  As you know, as she announced back on Monday, Cindy Sheehan is going to be running against the Democratic House leader.
[00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:10.966]  The warmonger, the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.
[00:01:11.546 --> 00:01:23.934]  We've got her popping in in about 30 minutes, but that's the only guest today because I do want to have open phones in the second and third hour today to talk about the five aircraft carriers.
[00:01:24.014 --> 00:01:24.794]  It's not three.
[00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:31.198]  Five aircraft carriers and hundreds of auxiliary ships in the Persian Gulf.
[00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:36.321]  You can discuss the continual erosion of the dollar.
[00:01:37.077 --> 00:01:44.584]  We can discuss any issue you'd like, the North American Union unfolding and metastasizing in front of our eyeballs.
[00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:57.517]  Of the hundreds of issues, I love the different directions you, the listeners, take us in, so I'm going to try to be disciplined, I'm going to be a little bit better about it, and take a bunch of your calls in the second and third hour today.
[00:01:58.437 --> 00:02:00.900]  It is already Wednesday, the 11th day of July, 2007.
[00:02:04.142 --> 00:02:15.224]  All right, in the last week we have seen a high-level, top neocon, former senator come out and say, don't worry, people will be for the war real soon, they're going to be a big event.
[00:02:16.665 --> 00:02:23.326]  We have Republican memos going back two years ago saying without a huge terror attack, they're not going to be able to continue their New World Order.
[00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:26.767]  PNAC says the same thing, right before 9-11.
[00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:32.548]  In the last month, we've had the head of the Republican Party in a major state,
[00:02:33.547 --> 00:02:37.008]  Again, a former top neocon senator, still a top neocon.
[00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:43.231]  We have had now a bunch of top military analysts in the US and Canada and England saying it.
[00:02:43.751 --> 00:02:55.595]  There have been four articles that we've written since Monday, in just three days, up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, just dealing with this alone.
[00:02:57.276 --> 00:03:02.278]  And this chatter from the terrorists, this is terrorist chatter, is a little bit different
[00:03:03.243 --> 00:03:07.305]  than the fear-mongering we've seen the last five years, five and a half plus years.
[00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:17.490]  This has a lot of the earmarks of a preparatory prep phase before they do hit us and hit us hard.
[00:03:18.511 --> 00:03:26.815]  And then everyone can, of course, put candles out front their doors, watch the television, and worship the actual terrorist as they pose as saviors on television.
[00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:28.936]  And it's just so over the top.
[00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:32.658]  There's such unbelievable chutzpah, aplomb, bravada,
[00:03:34.082 --> 00:03:39.405]  Arrogance that a lot of people just cannot believe they'd staged terror attacks.
[00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:45.208]  It doesn't matter if they've been caught a hundred times doing it plus and there's all these declassified documents where they admit they do.
[00:03:45.948 --> 00:03:57.074]  It's just we have to run to their arms and climb into their arms and say protect me from the terrorist and they pat us on the head and kiss us on the cheek and say you bet I will.
[00:04:00.315 --> 00:04:16.268]  These nice men in the black mask will keep you safe while we destroy the country's sovereignty and overrun you with anti-American foreigners and have unlimited levels of them pouring in.
[00:04:16.448 --> 00:04:18.970]  We're your government.
[00:04:20.131 --> 00:04:21.352]  We're good.
[00:04:22.052 --> 00:04:22.953]  We don't lie.
[00:04:22.973 --> 00:04:24.874]  We're not engaged in any corruption.
[00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:26.095]  We're not gangsters.
[00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:29.398]  We're here to help you lovingly.
[00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.932]  Alright, I'm getting a little sarcastic, a little dark in my humor.
[00:04:37.032 --> 00:04:37.692]  It's not funny.
[00:04:38.373 --> 00:04:42.574]  When we come back, we'll get into this and much, much, much, much more.
[00:04:43.715 --> 00:04:52.518]  The auxiliary websites are Infowars.net, JonesReport.com, MartialLaw911.info, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:10.006]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.366 --> 00:05:17.978]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.706 --> 00:05:25.750]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:37.636]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.896 --> 00:05:41.418]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:43.800]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.962]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:05:48.562 --> 00:05:55.888]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:01.303 --> 00:06:02.044]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.224 --> 00:06:02.964]  Terrorism!
[00:06:03.084 --> 00:06:09.128]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:09.408 --> 00:06:11.009]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:13.731]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:14.111 --> 00:06:28.680]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.040]  government.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.001]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:31.381 --> 00:06:37.282]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:37.422 --> 00:06:41.923]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.
[00:06:42.163 --> 00:06:47.844]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:47.904 --> 00:06:49.264]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:49.484 --> 00:06:49.744]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.824 --> 00:06:51.585]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:01.098 --> 00:07:04.040]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.424]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:15.029]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:16.530]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:25.998]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:07:26.238 --> 00:07:27.839]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:36.927]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.750]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:08.471]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.192 --> 00:08:10.312]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.952 --> 00:08:11.773]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:13.334]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.394 --> 00:08:18.036]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.276 --> 00:08:22.418]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:35.144]  Well, now... Michael Chertoff says he feels in his gut
[00:08:36.267 --> 00:08:39.789]  So do I. Especially when I look at him on television.
[00:08:41.369 --> 00:08:46.631]  Feels in his gut that the terrorists may strike any moment.
[00:08:47.692 --> 00:08:52.854]  And so they're having federally funded police randomly setting up cordons and checkpoints.
[00:08:52.914 --> 00:08:54.314]  Just, just, just randomly.
[00:08:54.375 --> 00:09:01.938]  It's like, we're looking for the Tooth Fairy, so we're gonna randomly go to Timbuktu and just search random farmhouses.
[00:09:02.798 --> 00:09:05.139]  Yes, that's going to catch LCI Ada.
[00:09:05.925 --> 00:09:12.190]  All you need to do, Chertoff, is look in the mirror, and you will see Al Qaeda staring back at you.
[00:09:13.992 --> 00:09:14.813]  This is the headline.
[00:09:14.853 --> 00:09:16.894]  This is now the Associated Press, okay?
[00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:23.180]  Chertoff bases warnings on terrorists on gut feeling!
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.744]  And then the White House comes out and says, oh no, there's no real credible threat.
[00:09:28.144 --> 00:09:30.386]  They always fearmonger and then play the part of the savior.
[00:09:31.044 --> 00:09:32.285]  This is basic psychology.
[00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:35.649]  It's what their psychiatrists and psychologists and sociologists are telling them.
[00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:38.111]  They come out and they say, Al-Qaeda is going to hit us really hard.
[00:09:38.151 --> 00:09:41.394]  And then Bush or one of his minions comes out and says, no, no, no, no threat.
[00:09:41.774 --> 00:09:42.876]  We're keeping you safe.
[00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:47.360]  People go, oh, oh, thank you, father.
[00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:49.582]  It's parent psychology.
[00:09:50.083 --> 00:09:51.284]  Keep me safe.
[00:09:51.344 --> 00:09:54.827]  And the general public nuzzles up against Bush's leg.
[00:09:55.228 --> 00:09:55.308]  Oh,
[00:09:56.364 --> 00:09:58.625]  Keep me safe, and he'd pat you on the head.
[00:09:58.745 --> 00:10:00.446]  Yes, I will.
[00:10:01.106 --> 00:10:02.246]  It's so sick.
[00:10:02.426 --> 00:10:07.028]  I mean, these people already murdered a bunch of us, and they're up there doing this.
[00:10:08.528 --> 00:10:12.110]  Chertoff bases warning on terrorists on gut feeling.
[00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:24.334]  Meanwhile, we have all these top Pentagon people, other War College heads, we've got all these politicians, White House memos, saying we need terror attacks.
[00:10:26.286 --> 00:10:33.708]  Just like Cheney publishing the PNAC document in September 2000, we need a catalyzing Pearl Harbor event or we're not going to get our New World Order.
[00:10:35.109 --> 00:10:36.109]  So just here are the headlines.
[00:10:36.429 --> 00:10:41.771]  Bush administration pays for more, prays for more debt Americans.
[00:10:42.518 --> 00:10:45.801]  Bush administration prays for more dead Americans.
[00:10:45.821 --> 00:10:47.163]  I had a Freudian slip there.
[00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:49.885]  Bush administration pays for more dead Americans.
[00:10:49.925 --> 00:10:51.026]  That's basically what they do.
[00:10:51.046 --> 00:10:52.367]  They finance this stuff.
[00:10:52.888 --> 00:10:54.790]  Bush administration prays for more dead Americans.
[00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.033]  Officials don't worry, that's a quote, about terror.
[00:10:58.413 --> 00:11:05.079]  They crave it to save doomed foreign policy and are actively bankrolling Al Qaeda in Iran.
[00:11:07.529 --> 00:11:13.612]  It was about a month and a half ago that Paul Watson and I had Paul on the air.
[00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:17.495]  We did a story about it, saying that the U.S.
[00:11:17.535 --> 00:11:20.156]  government is financing Al Qaeda to attack Iran.
[00:11:22.237 --> 00:11:24.518]  Now, it was in the Middle Eastern newspapers.
[00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:27.320]  It was even in the European papers and a few British papers.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.241]  But they didn't have that headline.
[00:11:29.261 --> 00:11:34.704]  It was just buried in the news that, oh, the admitted Sunni radical Wahhabi sect
[00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:48.842]  literally formed by Osama Bin Laden in the mid-1980s, is carrying out bombings and police shootings and attacks on military installations all over Western Iran under U.S.
[00:11:48.882 --> 00:11:49.763]  funding and command.
[00:11:51.565 --> 00:12:01.534]  And I said, well, I called Watson up and I said, research this, do a story on it, and he did a great job vetting it and getting even more data, that it was indeed
[00:12:02.995 --> 00:12:09.337]  For three years, our criminal government has been funding Al Qaeda.
[00:12:09.477 --> 00:12:12.378]  I mean, if there's any real Al Qaeda in the world, this is it.
[00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:14.879]  This is real Al Qaeda.
[00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:17.300]  To attack the Iranians.
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:23.042]  Now, how could they do something so bold, so out in the open, so obvious?
[00:12:26.003 --> 00:12:30.284]  Because the public doesn't know the difference between a Shiite and a Sunni.
[00:12:31.565 --> 00:12:31.945]  That's why.
[00:12:33.357 --> 00:12:47.669]  I mean, every time the Shiites get in a scrap with the international forces, it's not even our military anymore, the globalist forces, it's generally Shiite, and they even dare get in a firefight against helicopters.
[00:12:49.891 --> 00:13:02.741]  They're called cowardly wimps because they fight, you know, 50 to 1 odds, that's the new... They're invaded, they're occupied, they're Shiite, the opposite of Al-Qaeda, and they're called Al-Qaeda!
[00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:05.360]  I mean, they got generals up on TV.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.181]  We've been taping all this.
[00:13:07.201 --> 00:13:09.062]  I may make a film about the Iraq War in the future.
[00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:15.025]  And they just get up and say, we're fighting Al-Qaeda, and they list Shiite leaders' names, and man, it's Al-Qaeda!
[00:13:18.306 --> 00:13:19.867]  I mean, that's like saying...
[00:13:23.357 --> 00:13:46.501]  Black is white, or up is down, or left is right, I mean that's just a... I know I talk a lot about this, I know you the listeners know this better than I do, but I mean the general public does not know, and now it's in the AP, now it's in Reuters, now it's in White House releases, that they admit that they are funding the Wahhabis to attack the Iranians.
[00:13:46.581 --> 00:13:50.762]  I mean, our government, which again is not our government, is admittedly
[00:13:51.926 --> 00:14:03.070]  Financing real live terrorists to attack civilian targets in Iran, and Iran is laying there and taking it because they're extremely wise.
[00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:10.872]  If Iran fights back in any way, they're going to be bombarded with tactical nuclear weapons.
[00:14:11.332 --> 00:14:17.714]  For the crowd that goes to rodeos, who can't ride horses by the way, and wear shirts that say, nuke them until they glow.
[00:14:18.654 --> 00:14:20.275]  Go to any rodeo, you'll see these shirts.
[00:14:22.768 --> 00:14:24.970]  You'll see these guys weigh about 400 pounds.
[00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.671]  They can barely get out of their dulies.
[00:14:27.331 --> 00:14:28.992]  They've never thrown a calf.
[00:14:29.032 --> 00:14:29.493]  They've never...
[00:14:30.325 --> 00:14:31.965]  They run an electric de-horner.
[00:14:32.005 --> 00:14:35.366]  They've never probably ridden a horse, maybe once or twice.
[00:14:35.766 --> 00:14:36.726]  And man, they got big ol' cowboy hats.
[00:14:36.746 --> 00:14:59.351]  And they're walking around going, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[00:15:00.228 --> 00:15:01.589]  They don't know anything.
[00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:13.197]  They just know they sit in front of the television set, watching Fox News, drinking beer, and waddling around in front of their wife, acting tough in front of their children.
[00:15:13.717 --> 00:15:16.078]  That's about what these cowardly scum do.
[00:15:16.098 --> 00:15:22.563]  Alright, I'm already digressing with my hatred of them.
[00:15:22.603 --> 00:15:23.023]  I'm sorry.
[00:15:24.326 --> 00:15:26.007]  And all the other posers and phonies.
[00:15:26.387 --> 00:15:30.109]  I never knew what the word poser meant until I got older and I started figuring it out.
[00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:31.570]  We are a nation of posers.
[00:15:35.092 --> 00:15:40.435]  And I love this country and what's left of it, but we're not going to get it back unless we admit how pathetic we are and how wrong we are.
[00:15:40.535 --> 00:15:41.756]  It's like if you're a drug addict.
[00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:43.677]  You're going to have to admit up to your problem.
[00:15:43.697 --> 00:15:45.278]  You're going to have to admit up to your addiction.
[00:15:45.298 --> 00:15:47.319]  You're going to have to admit up to the problems you've got in your life.
[00:15:47.619 --> 00:15:51.481]  You've got to stop being in denial and realize how pathetic you are and get off the junk.
[00:15:56.337 --> 00:15:58.438]  And as a nation, we're pretty pathetic, folks.
[00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:07.182]  You know how dangerous it is when the public doesn't know their head from a hole in the ground, and the cops don't, and most of the people in government don't even know?
[00:16:08.482 --> 00:16:15.526]  People just go through a daily routine, they just accept their environment like it was pre-placed there for them, and this is like some big Six Flags.
[00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:16.986]  This isn't a Six Flags.
[00:16:17.186 --> 00:16:18.207]  We built a nation.
[00:16:18.367 --> 00:16:19.327]  We built walls.
[00:16:19.567 --> 00:16:25.210]  We built an economy and a military because we knew liberty was so rare and special and had to be defended.
[00:16:26.718 --> 00:16:35.765]  And now we're the great-great-grandchildren of the people that built this nation, and we're just sitting around like a bunch of slovenly hogs, just thinking it's going to go on forever.
[00:16:36.065 --> 00:16:36.506]  It isn't.
[00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:49.396]  And then these people have the nerve to go, freedom isn't free, we've got to attack Iran, we've got to do that to legitimize the Iraq War, we've got to do it because they'll fight us over here, we don't fight them over there.
[00:16:50.649 --> 00:16:55.673]  Bush gave a speech again yesterday saying Al-Qaeda is in Iraq, and that's why we've got to be there.
[00:16:55.733 --> 00:17:03.240]  Meanwhile, the real Al-Qaeda is openly run by our government, publicly, in White House press releases!
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.822]  I mean, it's the White House saying it!
[00:17:06.502 --> 00:17:09.645]  And the public can't put 2 plus 2 together!
[00:17:09.665 --> 00:17:13.388]  I mean, do you realize the magnitude of that?
[00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:18.953]  The just off the chart, I use that term a lot, because it is, it's just off the scale!
[00:17:19.921 --> 00:17:24.663]  There's no way to even measure the 1984 bizarreness of this!
[00:17:27.564 --> 00:17:39.490]  I mean, openly funding Al-Qaeda to attack Iran while our media says that Iran runs Al-Qaeda and that Iran is Al-Qaeda when Iran is Shiite.
[00:17:41.411 --> 00:17:46.293]  The complete opposite of the Saudi Arabian-based Wahhabist.
[00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:51.242]  The ABSOLUTE POLAR OPPOSITE!
[00:17:52.082 --> 00:17:58.984]  Let me put this in clear terms for the yuppies driving around, or the guys with the lariats in the back of their cars that can't rope.
[00:17:59.764 --> 00:18:03.285]  Let me just put it in perspe... or the yuppies, or just all of you.
[00:18:06.506 --> 00:18:13.008]  The Pentagon said they were going to go in Iraq, break it in three or four parts, told you this year before the war started, now they're announcing it,
[00:18:14.043 --> 00:18:17.726]  And you're running around with your new plan, parroting it on the radio, that just came to you today.
[00:18:19.807 --> 00:18:26.411]  They said, we're going to go in there, break it in three or four parts, we're going to balkanize it, and then use it as a military base to attack the surrounding region.
[00:18:28.312 --> 00:18:32.395]  And we're never going to leave, and we're going to have the different sects fight with each other.
[00:18:32.455 --> 00:18:34.036]  I mean, it's a cold-blooded evil plan.
[00:18:34.416 --> 00:18:41.040]  And then, you see, so you think Bush is in trouble, or that Bush is being discredited, and, oh, the government failed, they screwed up,
[00:18:41.681 --> 00:18:47.862]  And on national TV and radio they said many times about myself and others, well, 9-11 Truth says it's an inside job.
[00:18:48.162 --> 00:18:51.903]  If they can't even run Iraq, how could they run those attacks?
[00:18:53.984 --> 00:18:56.564]  And man, the military, they sure didn't do a good job.
[00:18:56.584 --> 00:18:58.204]  Boy, they didn't know what they were doing.
[00:18:58.465 --> 00:19:00.565]  They have performed flawlessly.
[00:19:01.985 --> 00:19:07.126]  But the evil of it is so massive that the general public can't even grasp it.
[00:19:08.167 --> 00:19:10.087]  And they have Al-Qaeda.
[00:19:13.147 --> 00:19:25.022]  Al Qaeda publicly funded by this criminal government to attack Iran and then they simultaneously claim Iran is Al Qaeda.
[00:19:27.623 --> 00:19:51.017]  And say if Iran fights back in any way, and they've released three different plans, they're all basically the same, we're talking about a two-month bombardment of every ship, every tank, every water treatment plant, every power plant, anything that could be used in science, they're going to stone age that country, while a bunch of idiots sit around in their easy chairs going, hit Al-Qaeda, hit Al-Qaeda, hit Al-Qaeda!
[00:19:51.357 --> 00:19:53.859]  I mean, it's just, it's just, it's unbelievable.
[00:19:55.257 --> 00:19:58.438]  It's un- and Iran sits there while they're under real terror attack.
[00:19:59.219 --> 00:20:00.119]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:14.805]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:20:14.825 --> 00:20:18.486]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria,
[00:20:18.766 --> 00:20:22.990]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:27.213]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:20:27.433 --> 00:20:33.939]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:20:34.179 --> 00:20:39.664]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:20:39.904 --> 00:20:46.829]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[00:20:46.889 --> 00:20:48.891]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.

[00:21:03.015 --> 00:21:09.137]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live with an urgent message regarding Ed and Elaine Brown and their brave stand against the IRS.
[00:21:09.817 --> 00:21:19.940]  WTPRN.com and GCNLive.com join together to organize and promote the Live Free or Die concert on Saturday, July 14th in Flamefield, New Hampshire.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:30.805]  Aside from a day of great music from bands like Poker Face, Dave Von Kleist, Blue Eyed Fools, Paperback Radio, and many more, the true purpose of this event is to come to the defense of Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:21:31.005 --> 00:21:34.867]  Friends, we're also in need of donations to cover costs of staging this historic event.
[00:21:35.087 --> 00:21:42.090]  Ed and Elaine Brown have put their lives on the line to stand up to the IRS's tyranny, so please give generously to help this concert become a success.
[00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:51.981]  Join me, Randy Weaver, and more surprise guests on July 14th to become part of this effort to defend the Browns, as it is literally a matter of life and death.

[00:22:02.734 --> 00:22:04.796]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:05.417 --> 00:22:14.347]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.788 --> 00:22:21.996]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:28.194]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:01.835 --> 00:23:04.316]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:04.876 --> 00:23:10.198]  Did you know that the United Nations has always chosen socialist one-worlders for its leadership?
[00:23:10.878 --> 00:23:17.041]  Did you know that the United Nations seeks power to control the environment, population, children, and the whole world?
[00:23:17.701 --> 00:23:20.542]  They want to dissolve our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:23:21.162 --> 00:23:32.426]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.761]  We are armed!
[00:24:07.001 --> 00:24:11.043]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[00:24:11.103 --> 00:24:13.184]  Would you stand up but shoot?
[00:24:13.264 --> 00:24:14.825]  Or would you turn away too?
[00:24:15.105 --> 00:24:20.108]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[00:24:20.168 --> 00:24:22.289]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[00:24:22.929 --> 00:24:25.450]  Or would you turn and walk away?
[00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.813]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[00:24:45.695 --> 00:24:46.696]  We're good to go.
[00:25:07.038 --> 00:25:09.781]  And now I'm hopin' you don't close your mind so they shape ya.
[00:25:09.821 --> 00:25:12.184]  Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us slaves and rapists.
[00:25:12.364 --> 00:25:14.767]  Another push season mean another war for profit.
[00:25:15.027 --> 00:25:17.550]  All is secret so the public never stick to stop it.
[00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.153]  The Illuminati, triple six, all connected.
[00:25:20.193 --> 00:25:22.595]  Stole the votes, they control the race and take elections.
[00:25:22.695 --> 00:25:25.238]  It's the Skull and Bones Freemason Kill Committee.
[00:25:25.438 --> 00:25:27.741]  See the dragon get beat up in every city.
[00:25:39.651 --> 00:25:46.867]  You know, that Paris song is so good that I really shouldn't even have it in the bumper music lineup because I can't stand and not listen to it every time it plays.
[00:25:48.627 --> 00:25:52.268]  By the way, speaking of the black community, doing more research on eugenics,
[00:26:18.072 --> 00:26:38.979]  I mean, I got the actual books, the actual letters, the actual documents, where Margaret Sanger, big supporter of Hitler and others, and the heir to Mr. Gamble, the heir to the Procter & Gamble fortune, ivory sub-fortune, where they went out and hired black leaders to help them sell the eugenics program against blacks.
[00:26:40.579 --> 00:26:42.920]  And I mean some of the biggest names in black history.
[00:26:45.802 --> 00:26:48.103]  Like WDB Du Bois and people like that.
[00:26:48.123 --> 00:26:55.028]  It's going to freak people out when they see this film with their precious liberal black leaders.
[00:26:55.868 --> 00:26:56.929]  Yeah, let me tell you something.
[00:26:56.949 --> 00:27:00.051]  These black leaders you see on TV, I'm just telling black folks this right now.
[00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:02.192]  They're total new world order.
[00:27:02.212 --> 00:27:05.454]  They tell you what you want to hear when the cops beat up some black kid.
[00:27:05.474 --> 00:27:08.236]  They'll show up and yell and scream all day.
[00:27:09.397 --> 00:27:14.200]  But when they're engaging in mass evil against black people coast to coast and worldwide,
[00:27:15.074 --> 00:27:21.315]  And when they're sterilizing blacks in Africa right now, they don't say a word, because they're on the payroll.
[00:27:21.776 --> 00:27:23.656]  And you better get that through your head.
[00:27:24.056 --> 00:27:25.977]  And I'm going to tell all the Mexicans something, too.
[00:27:26.537 --> 00:27:27.997]  I don't want your babies to die.
[00:27:28.817 --> 00:27:35.499]  You've got your Hola Reconquista, you've got your Mexican radio telling you you're taking over the U.S., and boy, it's your time and all this baloney.
[00:27:35.679 --> 00:27:37.979]  The New World Order's running game on that whole thing.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:44.681]  You better learn how they roll, and you better find out what's going on, unless you want to be played.
[00:27:45.825 --> 00:27:48.527]  And all the white scum yuppies, you too, you're the worst.
[00:27:49.307 --> 00:27:49.768]  All of you.
[00:27:50.248 --> 00:27:52.670]  You better start getting serious here.
[00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.091]  You better start looking for the scam.
[00:27:55.532 --> 00:27:57.093]  You better start looking for the trick.
[00:27:57.653 --> 00:28:00.835]  You better start looking for it, because believe me, it's all around you!
[00:28:03.677 --> 00:28:04.678]  I've had enough of it!
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:13.043]  I don't care if you've got a white baby, a black baby, or a brown baby, or a Chinese baby.
[00:28:13.144 --> 00:28:15.145]  I don't want your babies growing up in tyranny.
[00:28:15.899 --> 00:28:17.440]  Because I know how the universe works.
[00:28:19.921 --> 00:28:22.822]  If you don't want somebody else to be free, you're not going to be free.
[00:28:25.944 --> 00:28:27.225]  What comes around, goes around.
[00:28:27.245 --> 00:28:28.265]  You reap what you sow.
[00:28:30.006 --> 00:28:32.888]  And back to this situation, I'm going to get to it after Cindy Sheehan's on with this.
[00:28:32.908 --> 00:28:33.688]  I won't go to your calls.
[00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:37.070]  Bush administration prays for more dead Americans.
[00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:38.110]  It actually says that.
[00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.692]  Chertoff bases warnings on terror risk of gut feeling.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.343]  Then White House comes out and says, no specific terror threat against the U.S.
[00:28:45.603 --> 00:28:47.765]  They scare you, then they come and say, it's okay, baby.
[00:28:48.005 --> 00:28:49.547]  They say, oh, there's monsters in the closet.
[00:28:49.567 --> 00:28:50.808]  Then they say, oh, I'm just joking.
[00:28:51.108 --> 00:28:53.811]  So you cuddle up to their arms and their black wings.
[00:28:54.431 --> 00:28:55.372]  I just can't handle it.
[00:28:55.412 --> 00:28:56.093]  It's so sick.
[00:28:57.995 --> 00:28:59.036]  Military analyst.
[00:28:59.456 --> 00:29:02.999]  West needs more terror to save doomed foreign policy.
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:04.521]  That's a quote!
[00:29:06.863 --> 00:29:13.046]  We've got Republican Party Chairman, we've got the heads of, this is one of the Canadian War Colleges, we've got the heads of the U.S.
[00:29:13.066 --> 00:29:17.468]  War Colleges, we've got all these Republican memos, they're all coming out.
[00:29:17.488 --> 00:29:25.951]  We've got this Republican Senator saying last week, oh don't worry, there's going to be a new terror attack and you'll be for the war then.
[00:29:26.491 --> 00:29:28.692]  I mean, they tell you what they're going to do!
[00:29:31.213 --> 00:29:34.715]  But again, they know that half of Americans still think Saddam has been lodged.
[00:29:35.356 --> 00:29:37.458]  Literally, in Poland, they don't know who the difference is between the two of them.
[00:29:38.218 --> 00:29:43.542]  They don't know Shiite and Sunni, so they'll openly, publicly run Al-Qaeda, and then tell you they're fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:29:44.222 --> 00:29:45.844]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:29:46.704 --> 00:29:47.745]  It's unbelievable.
[00:29:52.128 --> 00:29:53.049]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:55.110]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.031 --> 00:29:58.713]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:06.642]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[00:30:06.902 --> 00:30:10.764]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[00:30:11.145 --> 00:30:16.168]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[00:30:16.428 --> 00:30:27.616]  Electrolyzed Plus Water will alkalinize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[00:30:27.956 --> 00:30:32.298]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and environmentally safe for humans and animals.
[00:30:32.538 --> 00:30:41.862]  Alkaline water is available as a concentrate to be mixed with good, filtered, purified RO water but not tap water, micro-structured alkaline antioxidant water for consumption.

[00:31:11.449 --> 00:31:12.089]  Hard-hitting?
[00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:15.370]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:16.930]  War in Iran?
[00:31:17.431 --> 00:31:19.091]  A coming One World Church?
[00:31:19.851 --> 00:31:25.155]  And the first issue has included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[00:32:03.908 --> 00:32:08.031]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:32:08.271 --> 00:32:10.013]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:32:10.293 --> 00:32:16.578]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:32:16.878 --> 00:32:22.983]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:32:23.243 --> 00:32:29.268]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[00:32:29.548 --> 00:32:35.950]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:39.651]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:43.653]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.

[00:33:17.009 --> 00:33:27.939]  Well, Cindy Sheehan, I remember years ago, when she first got started, hearing her on Power Hour with David Joyce, and then I interviewed her shortly after.
[00:33:28.039 --> 00:33:31.102]  I'm really proud of this network, that we were there at the start.
[00:33:31.122 --> 00:33:33.144]  I've been interviewing Ron Paul for 12 years.
[00:33:34.365 --> 00:33:36.186]  Now it's international sensation.
[00:33:36.206 --> 00:33:38.649]  Now even MSNBC is calling him the next president.
[00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:43.313]  That's because they're realizing how much momentum he's got.
[00:33:44.125 --> 00:33:49.887]  Las Vegas is saying he's the only person that can beat Hillary Clinton, the only Republican that can at Warmonger.
[00:33:50.347 --> 00:33:55.569]  And I'm really proud of the fact that Genesis has been interviewing Cindy Sheehan since she first started her fight.
[00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:57.550]  And she's a testament.
[00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:00.171]  She's a great lady, been demonized and lied about.
[00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:05.133]  And it's a testament to her fortitude, what one person can do with your support
[00:34:05.777 --> 00:34:14.047]  Her walks across the country, her traveling, the thousands of interviews she's done, the Crawford Peace House, putting Bush's feet to the fire.
[00:34:14.908 --> 00:34:18.372]  She's been a real catalyst against this war since day one.
[00:34:19.088 --> 00:34:21.950]  When it was unpopular to be against the war.
[00:34:22.571 --> 00:34:35.701]  And so she took the heat, she hit the barbed wire for so many of us, and now she is pointing out the traitorous activities of the Democratic Party, who are stalling and continuing the war, and many of them want to attack Iran.
[00:34:36.301 --> 00:34:45.008]  And she pledged that if Nancy Pelosi didn't move to get us out of this war, that she was going to run against her in San Francisco.
[00:34:45.028 --> 00:34:46.509]  That's where Cindy's from.
[00:34:46.529 --> 00:34:47.350]  That's where Cindy lives.
[00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.791]  And she's doing it.
[00:34:49.412 --> 00:34:51.112]  And we need to get behind her.
[00:34:51.252 --> 00:35:09.157]  She's got a lot more name recognition, a lot more respect, and of course that's why the Democratic handlers that were around Cindy tried to desert her when they found out that she was talking about months ago, going after Pelosi, because they know she can beat her, and they were there to try to, in my opinion, and I've got a pretty good brain politically,
[00:35:09.967 --> 00:35:11.929]  Now she is a free spirit.
[00:35:12.009 --> 00:35:19.995]  She is truly going for her full potential and I think she should become a member of the House of Representatives and she can do it.
[00:35:20.556 --> 00:35:27.081]  She's wildly popular in her district and unless there's skullduggery, she can win.
[00:35:27.161 --> 00:35:29.983]  Now, before we go to her, I'm just giving you the analysis.
[00:35:30.003 --> 00:35:31.444]  I want to get her takes on this.
[00:35:33.835 --> 00:35:41.241]  Regardless, even if she doesn't win, it's the fight that matters, being in the arena, embarrassing Pelosi, going to those debates, putting her on the spot.
[00:35:41.501 --> 00:35:51.008]  Cindy Sheehan, I salute your quest that has been very successful, and now Republican senators are defecting faster than Democrats.
[00:35:51.769 --> 00:35:54.891]  You, again, I just admire you, Cindy.
[00:35:55.612 --> 00:35:56.572]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[00:35:56.613 --> 00:36:07.684]  You know, I've been saying for a long time that the party who distances itself the fastest and farthest away from George Bush is going to be successful in 08.
[00:36:08.384 --> 00:36:11.828]  And like you said, apparently it looks like the Republicans are doing that.
[00:36:12.908 --> 00:36:19.131]  I think we've already had some victories since I announced it because now everybody's talking about impeachment.
[00:36:19.592 --> 00:36:26.235]  People are talking about how little difference there is between the Democrats and the Republican Party.
[00:36:26.635 --> 00:36:32.118]  So we get this, and when I started in August of 2005 at Count Casey, people started talking about
[00:36:32.678 --> 00:36:33.259]  I think so.
[00:36:33.479 --> 00:36:34.140]  I think so.
[00:36:46.118 --> 00:36:56.669]  If I challenge Pelosi, we've already had so many victories, and I'm hoping that my candidacy will bring to the forefront about how corrupt both parties are.
[00:36:56.729 --> 00:36:59.412]  The culture of corruption doesn't stop at the Republican Party.
[00:37:00.193 --> 00:37:03.617]  You know, and people need to realize that politics are not our saviors.
[00:37:04.494 --> 00:37:18.077]  Well, Cindy, I did my own analysis of your candidacy over the weekend on Monday, and I've got to tell you, barring cheating, which we know they're not above, that you will beat Pelosi.
[00:37:18.458 --> 00:37:32.221]  Their angle's going to be, oh, she's a woman, oh, she's the first Speaker of the House, female, she brings great power and money to San Francisco, and your argument's got to be her daughter produced Bush's propaganda TV shows, she's a total sellout,
[00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:35.027]  To the globalist pro-war agenda.
[00:37:35.047 --> 00:37:43.259]  I mean, you know what to do, but I would attack her right up front on that and just go right at the juggler that we don't need another fat cat politician.
[00:37:43.279 --> 00:37:43.500]  Cindy?
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:53.243]  Well, you know, Nancy Pelosi, I'm a born and raised California girl, you know, strictly flat out in the middle class.
[00:37:53.383 --> 00:37:55.904]  Nancy Pelosi has a mansion on the hill.
[00:37:56.404 --> 00:38:00.966]  She doesn't, um, she's disconnected from the people of her district.
[00:38:01.426 --> 00:38:04.407]  She's disconnected from the people of America.
[00:38:05.107 --> 00:38:06.768]  That's what happens with these elite.
[00:38:06.828 --> 00:38:07.728]  And I'm, you know, when
[00:38:08.389 --> 00:38:10.413]  I talk about people in Congress.
[00:38:10.473 --> 00:38:18.129]  I don't mean people like Ron Paul or people like Dennis Kucinich, who I think are still very... I mean, I had breakfast at Dennis Kucinich's house.
[00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.172]  It was very modest.
[00:38:19.815 --> 00:38:26.698]  You know, they're still connected, I think, with the people who they represent, but most people aren't.
[00:38:26.818 --> 00:38:28.639]  You know, they're wealthy.
[00:38:28.699 --> 00:38:35.943]  Nancy Pelosi gets contributions and has investments in companies that profit off war.
[00:38:36.343 --> 00:38:46.068]  Nancy Pelosi's, one of her biggest contributors is AIPAC, and you can't have allegiance to two countries when you're
[00:38:47.075 --> 00:38:49.999]  You know, a lawmaker in one of those countries.
[00:38:50.399 --> 00:39:04.356]  And I think that's another problem with our system is that many of our elected officials do get so much money from AIPAC and they take Israel's best interests into account when they're making decisions about what's best for America.
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:09.681]  Cindy, how can people support you in your run against Pelosi?
[00:39:09.861 --> 00:39:11.261]  Well, first, let's get back to the challenge.
[00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:25.405]  For those that weren't paying attention, specifically, you met with Pelosi and you also told her, if you don't move to get us out of the war or move for impeachment, I think you pared it back to be reasonable to just get us out of the war.
[00:39:25.705 --> 00:39:26.705]  I'm going to run against you.
[00:39:26.745 --> 00:39:27.705]  Go over that for us.
[00:39:29.566 --> 00:39:35.087]  Well, I think that we can't get out of the war while George Bush and Dick Cheney are in office.
[00:39:35.865 --> 00:39:43.430]  And George Bush has said it all over and over again that, you know, he's not bringing the troops home while he's president and the war is not ending.
[00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:52.256]  And, you know, Congress, as we all know, recently gave George Bush a hundred billion more dollars to wage war in the Middle East.
[00:39:52.376 --> 00:39:58.600]  And like you pointed out, all of the leading candidates for president on both parties
[00:39:59.250 --> 00:39:59.590]  I don't
[00:40:18.943 --> 00:40:21.704]  You know, declaring martial law and suspending elections.
[00:40:21.784 --> 00:40:24.005]  So, you know, that's why they have to be stopped.
[00:40:24.065 --> 00:40:31.809]  So, I just challenged her the other day and I said, if you don't have impeachment on the table by the time I get to Washington D.C.
[00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:38.432]  on July 23rd, I will run against you and I will give you a run for your money.
[00:40:39.756 --> 00:40:52.141]  Now, Cindy, President Bush has had one of the top neocon former senators has come out and said, don't worry there's going to be a big event so people will want to attack Iran in the next year.
[00:40:52.642 --> 00:40:57.183]  We also have one of the heads of the Canadian War College saying we need terror attacks.
[00:40:57.504 --> 00:41:05.707]  We have a Republican memo confirmed from a year and a half ago saying we need terror attacks or our agenda of warfare is going to stall.
[00:41:06.427 --> 00:41:07.708]  We have a new article out today.
[00:41:07.768 --> 00:41:09.850]  Bush administration prays for more dead Americans.
[00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:10.430]  This is a quote.
[00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:15.314]  Officials don't worry about terror, they crave it to save a doomed foreign policy.
[00:41:15.994 --> 00:41:17.696]  I mean, this is getting scary.
[00:41:17.716 --> 00:41:20.358]  Chertoff says he feels an attack in his gut.
[00:41:20.698 --> 00:41:23.920]  Military analyst, West needs more terror to save doomed foreign policy.
[00:41:24.461 --> 00:41:28.804]  We now know he was illegally on the Pentagon payroll when he claimed he was a private citizen.
[00:41:29.304 --> 00:41:37.250]  We have Tommy Franks and Chigar Aficionado now, three years ago, saying one more big terror attack, they will set aside the Constitution for a military form of government.
[00:41:37.571 --> 00:41:46.778]  President Bush signed the Presidential Decision Directive 51, putting things under martial law, removing Congress' authority during insurrection or resistance.
[00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:51.842]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act of last year funded it for this year.
[00:41:51.962 --> 00:41:55.385]  It says it in there for domestic insurrection or resistance.
[00:41:56.665 --> 00:42:00.607]  I mean, the Military Commissions Act says they can strip U.S.
[00:42:00.627 --> 00:42:05.049]  citizens secretly of citizenship, secretly torture, secretly execute us.
[00:42:05.269 --> 00:42:12.072]  I mean, folks, I've read the legislation here on air, I've covered the orders, so Cindy, I mean, just expanding on, Bush is saying
[00:42:13.333 --> 00:42:14.614]  Looks like we're going to have terror.
[00:42:15.394 --> 00:42:18.717]  A. Do you think we're in danger of them provocateuring or letting something happen?
[00:42:18.937 --> 00:42:20.839]  And then B. You talk about martial law.
[00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:26.503]  I mean, even the former Wall Street Journal editor, Dr. Paul Greg Roberts, is saying he thinks that may happen.
[00:42:26.763 --> 00:42:28.805]  So can you comment on martial law and staged terror?
[00:42:29.895 --> 00:42:40.499]  Well, you know, I definitely think that that is a distinct possibility, that there will be some kind of attack, whether it's manufactured or real.
[00:42:40.519 --> 00:42:47.822]  I am surprised we haven't been, again, attacked so far, but it maybe hasn't been to their advantage.
[00:42:49.002 --> 00:42:51.944]  And I think that it's really possible that these people will do that.
[00:42:52.324 --> 00:42:55.665]  Why would he put in that presidential directive if he didn't mean to use it?
[00:42:58.217 --> 00:43:00.960]  These are the times to try men and women's souls.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.342]  I think it's really, really frightening.
[00:43:03.742 --> 00:43:13.832]  And that's why we started this caravan walk across America from Crawford, Texas to New York City to wake people up, to wake people out of their slumber.
[00:43:14.252 --> 00:43:19.177]  Things aren't going to get better, and this country's not going to get better if you hide your head.
[00:43:19.777 --> 00:43:22.079]  In the sand and just hope that it gets better.
[00:43:22.139 --> 00:43:23.680]  We have to make it get better.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.662]  We have to have our elected leadership representing us.
[00:43:28.103 --> 00:43:30.304]  Holding George Bush and Dick Cheney accountable.
[00:43:30.404 --> 00:43:31.825]  If they don't, they're complicit.
[00:43:32.306 --> 00:43:37.769]  Over 600 soldiers have died since the Democrats have taken over power.
[00:43:37.909 --> 00:43:39.550]  Many thousands of Iraqis.
[00:43:39.871 --> 00:43:41.512]  The blood is on their hands.
[00:43:42.012 --> 00:43:47.576]  They have the power and authority to stop it.
[00:43:48.286 --> 00:43:59.517]  And support our troops, support the people of Iraq, save America from, you know, more threats from the Bush administration, and get them out of power.
[00:44:00.978 --> 00:44:04.982]  Cindy Sheehan, tell folks about the caravan, tell them about the websites, how people can support you.
[00:44:05.979 --> 00:44:17.563]  They can go to www.thecampkcpeaceinstitute.org for a route map, for daily updates on what we've been doing, what we will be doing.
[00:44:17.583 --> 00:44:23.826]  I just thought of this a few days before we left, so it's a fluid process as usual.
[00:44:24.746 --> 00:44:32.689]  And if you can't join us in both cities, you can donate at that site to help us cover our expenses along the way.
[00:44:33.189 --> 00:44:40.551]  And if I run for Congress against Pelosi, we'll of course have a whole new website and a whole new
[00:44:41.291 --> 00:44:42.332]  We're good to go.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:11.934]  You know, Ron Paul's been doing that, and he's raised over $7 million, more than McCain, and now the Las Vegas Oddsmakers are saying that he's the frontrunner and the Republicans of having any chance to beat a Democrat.
[00:45:12.174 --> 00:45:15.718]  What does that mean when somebody like Ron Paul has just exploded like this?
[00:45:16.258 --> 00:45:18.359]  It means people are hungering for change.
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.622]  People are hungering for people who tell the truth no matter what.
[00:45:23.102 --> 00:45:26.884]  And people are hungering for people who act out of their integrity.
[00:45:27.285 --> 00:45:31.147]  And I'm with somebody who has a shirt on that says InfoWars.com.
[00:45:31.207 --> 00:45:32.047]  Learn the truth.
[00:45:32.408 --> 00:45:35.509]  He's one of the people in our caravan.
[00:45:35.529 --> 00:45:37.010]  You want to say hi to Alex Jones?
[00:45:37.351 --> 00:45:37.711]  Sure.
[00:45:37.791 --> 00:45:39.872]  Hey man, I'm wearing an InfoWars shirt.
[00:45:40.112 --> 00:45:40.813]  Hey, you're awesome.
[00:45:40.853 --> 00:45:41.213]  Who's this?
[00:45:41.833 --> 00:45:42.694]  David Rubinson.
[00:45:43.194 --> 00:45:44.275]  I'm a subscriber.
[00:45:44.676 --> 00:45:45.456]  That's fantastic.
[00:45:45.496 --> 00:45:46.357]  Where are you right now?
[00:45:46.998 --> 00:45:49.820]  Right now we're outside Beaumont.
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:50.801]  No, we passed Beaumont.
[00:45:50.841 --> 00:45:51.722]  We're in Louisiana.
[00:45:52.362 --> 00:45:53.803]  We're going towards Lake Charles.
[00:45:55.185 --> 00:45:55.905]  Fantastic.
[00:45:55.965 --> 00:45:58.327]  Folks need to meet up with you in Lake Charles, my friend.
[00:45:59.068 --> 00:45:59.568]  God bless you.
[00:45:59.588 --> 00:46:00.209]  Where are you from?
[00:46:00.249 --> 00:46:01.290]  How far have you traveled?
[00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:02.611]  San Francisco.
[00:46:03.552 --> 00:46:04.813]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[00:46:04.853 --> 00:46:06.354]  You keep it up and take care.
[00:46:06.374 --> 00:46:07.335]  Can we talk to Cindy again?
[00:46:07.776 --> 00:46:08.016]  Sure.
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:09.100]  Thank you.
[00:46:09.901 --> 00:46:12.483]  Thanks for talking to David.
[00:46:12.543 --> 00:46:15.065]  He's a supporter of yours.
[00:46:15.105 --> 00:46:15.745]  Well, I love him.
[00:46:15.765 --> 00:46:16.406]  Tell him thank you.
[00:46:16.606 --> 00:46:22.451]  Cindy, I'm going to let you go because I know you're very busy here in just a moment, but let me just ask you one or two other key questions here.
[00:46:24.052 --> 00:46:32.999]  As we see the people rising against this tyranny, as we see the political paradigm being shattered for once and for all, the good news is that just a few years ago,
[00:46:33.914 --> 00:46:37.676]  You would have one party in favor, one party out of favor, and they could kind of double-team us.
[00:46:37.696 --> 00:46:44.240]  We know there hasn't been a big difference for a long time, but now it seems they have broken the mold, they have killed the goose that laid the golden eggs.
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:47.081]  It seems like the scam, the game is up.
[00:46:47.421 --> 00:46:55.386]  People don't know specifics, but when we've got a 12% approval rating for Cheney, 14% for Congress, Bush in many polls is as low as 25% now.
[00:46:56.146 --> 00:47:02.590]  I mean, is that not encouraging to you, to see that now basically anyone who's a warmonger has lost double credibility?
[00:47:03.604 --> 00:47:21.508]  Well, that is encouraging to me and I think it has a lot to do with our work since August of 2005 and I just want to see people really putting their thoughts, their words, their beliefs into action.
[00:47:21.928 --> 00:47:29.749]  You know, unlike Congress, Nancy Pelosi says that she's not going to impeach Bush and Cheney because she's focused on ending the war.
[00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:32.530]  Well, you know, her actions don't meet her words.
[00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:40.231]  We in America, and Americans, our actions have to meet our words.
[00:47:40.371 --> 00:47:42.012]  We have to get out.
[00:47:42.072 --> 00:47:43.332]  We have to get active.
[00:47:43.952 --> 00:47:47.793]  And this is what we're hoping that our caravan will inspire people to do.
[00:47:47.853 --> 00:47:48.873]  And my candidacy.
[00:47:49.553 --> 00:47:51.993]  My candidacy is making so many people uncomfortable.
[00:47:52.013 --> 00:47:59.815]  And like you said, a lot of organizations that I've worked through are so connected to the Democratic Party, it's freaking them out.
[00:48:01.175 --> 00:48:04.876]  He's calling me, begging me to run as a Democrat against Nancy Pelosi.
[00:48:04.916 --> 00:48:06.577]  What good is that, Alex?
[00:48:07.778 --> 00:48:08.418]  Absolutely.
[00:48:08.438 --> 00:48:13.340]  In closing, you have such an important platform, as you know.
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.301]  Tens of millions listen to the information you put out.
[00:48:16.341 --> 00:48:18.482]  The press pays attention to what you're doing, Cindy.
[00:48:19.202 --> 00:48:30.386]  And I would just ask you, and I know you're very informed on this subject, to look at the evidence and then to articulate it, because it's admitted that Wahhabis admitted Al Qaeda.
[00:48:31.101 --> 00:48:49.099]  He's being used, and Bush announced a month ago that he's publicly using them, Sy Hersh reported two years ago he was, to attack and bomb the Iranians, to shoot police, to destabilize Western Iran, and now it's in the mainstream news, finally, that the Bush administration is using
[00:48:51.338 --> 00:48:59.925]  Sunnis, Wahhabis, to attack the Iranians, and then Bush has the nerve to call the Shiite Iranians Al-Qaeda.
[00:49:00.606 --> 00:49:03.108]  I mean, they just treat the public like they're complete idiots.
[00:49:03.488 --> 00:49:08.852]  And the whole agenda of Iraq, the Pentagon admitted was to break it in three parts, stay there forever.
[00:49:09.753 --> 00:49:13.596]  I mean, I know that's not a soundbite, but how would you articulate that to people?
[00:49:13.796 --> 00:49:15.798]  I mean, it's just like, folks still think, some of them, that
[00:49:16.379 --> 00:49:17.681]  Saddam is Bin Laden.
[00:49:17.741 --> 00:49:22.550]  I mean, how do we really address the fact that Bush never meant to leave Iraq?
[00:49:28.678 --> 00:49:39.023]  The whole Middle East is breaking it up to their, you know, whether they're Sunni, Shia, you know, Druze, or Christian, or Jewish, whatever, breaking them up into their little communities.
[00:49:39.524 --> 00:49:47.147]  So there's, you know, hundreds of Middle East's instead of unified, cohesive countries.
[00:49:47.227 --> 00:49:50.209]  And that is the Project for a New American Century goal.
[00:49:50.729 --> 00:49:58.576]  So they have to, um, we're going, at the end of my caravan, I'm actually going to, um, not a ram,
[00:50:00.041 --> 00:50:02.662]  Jordan, Syria, and Iraq.
[00:50:02.702 --> 00:50:03.962]  I'm going to Southern Iraq.
[00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:11.143]  I'm going to talk to these... I'm not going to be, you know, in the green zone with a battalion of Marines around me.
[00:50:11.503 --> 00:50:19.625]  But I'm going to go with these tribes, sit with these tribes, talk to them, figure out what they... what's actually going on.
[00:50:19.645 --> 00:50:25.526]  And I'm going to go to Iraqi refugee camps and see what they need.
[00:50:25.566 --> 00:50:28.267]  We don't see... we don't hear about the millions
[00:50:28.947 --> 00:50:35.471]  of displaced Iraqi refugees in countries that have already absorbed too many Palestinian refugees.
[00:50:35.531 --> 00:50:36.572]  Cindy, we're out of time.
[00:50:36.612 --> 00:50:37.893]  I want to get you back up soon.
[00:50:37.953 --> 00:50:38.653]  Thank you for the time.
[00:50:38.693 --> 00:50:39.874]  But what a story!
[00:50:40.294 --> 00:50:48.039]  You lose your son, you lead a movement to end the fraudulent war, and then you have the courage to go to that dangerous zone yourself.
[00:50:48.399 --> 00:50:49.040]  It's incredible.
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:50.140]  Cindy, God bless you.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.081]  We'll be praying for you.
[00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:51.601]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:50:51.701 --> 00:50:52.242]  Thank you.
[00:50:52.262 --> 00:50:52.542]  Bye-bye.
[00:50:53.202 --> 00:50:55.204]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll come right back.
[00:50:55.484 --> 00:50:57.385]  Get into more news and then take your calls.
[00:51:04.855 --> 00:51:08.159]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.442]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.803 --> 00:51:18.453]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.133 --> 00:51:26.197]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.597 --> 00:51:38.003]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.323 --> 00:51:41.825]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.286 --> 00:51:44.227]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.547 --> 00:51:48.389]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.781 --> 00:52:02.541]  Terrorism!
[00:52:02.681 --> 00:52:03.461]  Terrorism!
[00:52:03.541 --> 00:52:09.603]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:52:09.863 --> 00:52:11.464]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:52:11.704 --> 00:52:14.184]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:14.564 --> 00:52:20.426]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was
[00:52:20.486 --> 00:52:29.131]  This video was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:29.172 --> 00:52:29.492]  government.
[00:52:29.672 --> 00:52:31.493]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:52:31.853 --> 00:52:37.777]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:52:37.917 --> 00:52:42.340]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:53:01.758 --> 00:53:02.178]  Attention!
[00:53:02.278 --> 00:53:05.099]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.701]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:53:10.021 --> 00:53:10.702]  Listen closely.
[00:53:11.342 --> 00:53:18.785]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[00:53:19.105 --> 00:53:27.875]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[00:53:28.195 --> 00:53:33.682]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[00:53:34.002 --> 00:53:43.444]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[00:53:43.644 --> 00:53:49.265]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.

[00:54:01.647 --> 00:54:27.501]  Before you slip into unconsciousness I'd like to have another kiss Another flashing chance at bliss Another kiss
[00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:41.174]  Whatever subject you want to talk about, whatever you want to get into, next hour, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:41.194 --> 00:54:41.254]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:57.845 --> 00:55:03.649]  All right, Military Analyst, West needs more terror to save doomed foreign policy.
[00:55:05.851 --> 00:55:12.996]  Only attacks on the scale of 9-11 and 7-7 can save Bolster Resolve, according to War Studies Head.
[00:55:13.016 --> 00:55:21.742]  The West needs more terror attacks on the scale of 9-11 and 7-7 in order to save a failing foreign policy, according to Lieutenant Colonel Doug
[00:55:22.927 --> 00:55:27.589]  Delaney, Chair of the War Studies Program at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario.
[00:55:28.089 --> 00:55:38.154]  The alarming admission can be found right at the end of a long and academic Toronto Star article about the history of conflict and why the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq are doomed.
[00:55:39.715 --> 00:55:41.936]  They're doomed if you believe the mission you're told they're for.
[00:55:42.096 --> 00:55:46.478]  It's to spread death and destruction and sell weapon systems and it's worked quite well.
[00:55:47.361 --> 00:55:55.849]  The Royal Military College of Canada, RMC, is the military academy of the Canadian Forces, and is in full degree, granting university, according to Wikipedia, and it goes on.
[00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:59.072]  And that's nothing compared to the Senators saying it, Bush saying it.
[00:55:59.092 --> 00:56:01.435]  After I take a bunch of calls, I'm going to get into these.
[00:56:02.732 --> 00:56:06.934]  Then I'm going to get into Data on Americans Mined for Terror Risk, AP.
[00:56:07.254 --> 00:56:15.979]  There's a photo of people driving through a small town with those big flashing signs the Feds paid for that used to say, high water ahead, or report drunk drivers.
[00:56:16.459 --> 00:56:20.321]  Terrorism tip line, call immediately, all crime is terror.
[00:56:20.941 --> 00:56:26.524]  Times Square reopens after security scare, lots of cops shoving people around and running around in ring-wraith outfits.
[00:56:27.282 --> 00:56:29.084]  I'm just conditioning you for martial law.
[00:56:29.624 --> 00:56:29.864]  U.S.
[00:56:29.904 --> 00:56:32.627]  sending third aircraft carrier to the Middle East, really the fifth.
[00:56:33.007 --> 00:56:39.072]  And again, a lot of people are saying it's a really old 45-year-old carrier, perfect for them to blow up and claim Iran did it.
[00:56:40.934 --> 00:56:43.976]  Praying for a terror strike, the GOP's newest political strategy.
[00:56:43.996 --> 00:56:45.137]  We're going to be going over that.
[00:56:45.257 --> 00:56:47.799]  Cheney impeachment bill gains yet another co-sponsor.
[00:56:49.101 --> 00:56:52.363]  George Washington was a fascist Nazi dictator.
[00:56:53.484 --> 00:56:55.286]  You've opened borders, left-wing Democrats
[00:56:56.326 --> 00:56:56.926]  Are moderate.
[00:56:57.066 --> 00:56:59.908]  That's what mainstream news is saying about George Washington now.
[00:57:00.969 --> 00:57:04.190]  And we'll also get into what's happening to McCain.
[00:57:07.172 --> 00:57:11.374]  Also, family attorney blows the whistle on state child protective service agencies.
[00:57:12.134 --> 00:57:14.976]  Pro-immigration forces back North American Union.
[00:57:15.036 --> 00:57:16.637]  Big news out there.
[00:57:17.668 --> 00:57:20.169]  We're going to be going over all of that for you.
[00:57:20.529 --> 00:57:26.432]  Before I end this hour, Terror Storm Special Edition with 17 minutes of added info.
[00:57:26.933 --> 00:57:30.114]  Now over 3 hours and what?
[00:57:30.134 --> 00:57:32.515]  15 minutes on the DVD with the extras.
[00:57:32.975 --> 00:57:42.260]  Incredible film documenting the history of government-sponsored terror, the admitted cases of it in 7-7 and 9-11, and the Iraq War, and what that's all really about.
[00:57:43.032 --> 00:57:46.034]  Best film ever made available right now at InfoWars.com.

[00:58:58.015 --> 00:58:58.676]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.336 --> 00:59:00.397]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.098 --> 00:59:02.239]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.879 --> 00:59:03.680]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:05.341]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.002 --> 00:59:09.845]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.185 --> 00:59:14.288]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:32.339 --> 00:59:35.742]  Wide open phones in the second and third hour today.
[00:59:35.882 --> 00:59:37.203]  Wide open phones.
[00:59:37.523 --> 00:59:41.906]  We'll be getting into the Republican Party openly praying for massive terror attacks.
[00:59:42.267 --> 00:59:44.328]  Admittedly saying terror attacks help them.
[00:59:45.029 --> 00:59:47.291]  Are there any cops left in America?
[00:59:47.311 --> 00:59:48.532]  Can you put two plus two together?
[00:59:49.092 --> 00:59:51.674]  They admit terror helps them, but then Al Qaeda is striking them.
[00:59:51.874 --> 00:59:54.837]  But then our government admittedly is using Al Qaeda to attack the Iranians.
[00:59:55.706 --> 00:59:56.447]  All verifiable.
[00:59:57.367 --> 00:59:58.929]  Can you put two plus two together?
[01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:03.092]  Let's go to Larry in Idaho, wide open phones.
[01:00:03.112 --> 01:00:03.652]  Go ahead, Larry.
[01:00:04.113 --> 01:00:06.735]  Hey, I want to thank you, Alex, for the great work you're doing.
[01:00:06.755 --> 01:00:08.256]  You're a damn good American.
[01:00:08.716 --> 01:00:10.538]  I've got two points that I want to express.
[01:00:10.558 --> 01:00:12.920]  The last one I need to get ahold of you with.
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:20.186]  The first one I want to point out is that the west, part of the west wing of the White House has been under construction and just opened back up.
[01:00:20.206 --> 01:00:22.988]  It's been down a year in construction.
[01:00:23.467 --> 01:00:23.987]  Okay.
[01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:25.688]  I got a real bad feeling about it.
[01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:28.209]  Now, my second point is this here.
[01:00:28.249 --> 01:00:33.371]  I talked to you a while back or whatever, but I didn't have time to explain to you that I've got an inheritance coming.
[01:00:34.231 --> 01:00:35.272]  And I've almost got it.
[01:00:36.452 --> 01:00:45.956]  But I've been, uh, these oil people are so against what I was going to do that they've threatened me and I've had the FBI pick a couple of them up and stuff like that.
[01:00:45.996 --> 01:00:48.557]  But I need to send you some documents to prove what I'm saying.
[01:00:48.577 --> 01:00:51.018]  Haven't you faxed those to me?
[01:00:52.139 --> 01:00:52.539]  Haven't I?
[01:00:53.402 --> 01:00:54.883]  I've gotten a bunch of stuff from you.
[01:00:55.844 --> 01:00:56.885]  Not from me, you haven't.
[01:00:57.125 --> 01:00:59.227]  What is it, 14 million dollars or something?
[01:00:59.748 --> 01:01:02.970]  No, no, it's 18.5, I killed in a plane wreck.
[01:01:03.271 --> 01:01:05.853]  You're saying you never faxed me anything saying that?
[01:01:06.573 --> 01:01:07.054]  No, I didn't.
[01:01:08.975 --> 01:01:15.261]  Wait a minute, I had you on a few months ago, you called in and you didn't write me letters, you didn't fax me info about that?
[01:01:15.761 --> 01:01:16.462]  No, I did not.
[01:01:17.443 --> 01:01:18.944]  Alright, I appreciate it all.
[01:01:18.964 --> 01:01:20.125]  Sure, sure, great, great.
[01:01:20.445 --> 01:01:21.046]  Thank you for the call.
[01:01:23.107 --> 01:01:26.168]  Listen, you can send me information if you want, okay?
[01:01:26.728 --> 01:01:27.728]  You can just mail it to me.
[01:01:28.008 --> 01:01:29.049]  My address is well known.
[01:01:30.089 --> 01:01:35.210]  It's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:46.373]  Someone with your exact same voice, who sounds just like you, called up on air a few months ago and said, I got so many million dollars coming to me, tied up in a bank in Europe,
[01:01:47.273 --> 01:01:49.154]  And I said, oh yeah, you faxed me some info.
[01:01:49.214 --> 01:01:51.734]  And you're like, yeah, I'm trying to get in touch with you.
[01:01:52.134 --> 01:01:53.555]  I want to give it to Ron Paul.
[01:01:55.175 --> 01:02:00.437]  And now you just called and you just said, uh, just, you know, I get these emails.
[01:02:00.497 --> 01:02:08.119]  I know everybody gets them from Nigeria saying, uh, you know, do this and we'll send you that.
[01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:09.759]  And I mean, sir, I'm not saying you're like that.
[01:02:09.779 --> 01:02:11.140]  You sound like a credible, nice guy.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.901]  I just don't live in that world of chasing after big checks and bonanzas and
[01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:17.207]  Stuff like that.
[01:02:17.247 --> 01:02:19.148]  Just give it to Ron Paul's campaign.
[01:02:20.389 --> 01:02:21.250]  When the time comes.
[01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:24.491]  And you don't need to even tell me about it or anything about it, okay?
[01:02:24.511 --> 01:02:25.652]  Because I just don't care.
[01:02:25.672 --> 01:02:27.633]  I mean, I'm going to get quite frank about it.
[01:02:27.713 --> 01:02:31.955]  I can imagine all the other Patriot Talk show hosts are just like going, ah, ah, ah, right now.
[01:02:32.335 --> 01:02:32.996]  I don't want it.
[01:02:33.596 --> 01:02:34.997]  I don't want the money.
[01:02:36.198 --> 01:02:36.838]  I don't care.
[01:02:37.818 --> 01:02:39.039]  If it's real, I don't care.
[01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:41.040]  Ah, ah, ah!
[01:02:41.861 --> 01:02:42.921]  How's that sound, everybody?
[01:02:42.941 --> 01:02:46.243]  I see all the other hosts.
[01:02:47.148 --> 01:02:52.451]  I get sick of everybody trying to piggyback on me, and then they see in me what's in their own heart.
[01:02:54.392 --> 01:02:58.174]  I mean, it's tough being number one, folks, when it comes to this movement.
[01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:00.335]  I don't like it, because I'm not perfect.
[01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:05.097]  I don't like being on a pedestal, everybody judging me, everybody hanging on everything I say, everything I do.
[01:03:05.117 --> 01:03:09.860]  Now, I do get a little bit irritated with the caller, because he's called in and talked about that stuff before.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:16.123]  In the earlier call, he did say he sent me a fax, so that's why I just can't listen to it anymore.
[01:03:18.224 --> 01:03:19.244]  Oh, God, help us.
[01:03:19.764 --> 01:03:20.165]  Help us.
[01:03:20.185 --> 01:03:21.725]  This country's so gone, folks.
[01:03:23.085 --> 01:03:25.026]  Just a delusional fruitcake basket.
[01:03:26.766 --> 01:03:27.466]  Oh, God.
[01:03:27.666 --> 01:03:29.187]  How did I ever get involved in this?
[01:03:30.627 --> 01:03:32.207]  How did I ever get involved in all this?
[01:03:32.227 --> 01:03:35.308]  All right.
[01:03:36.728 --> 01:03:37.428]  We're going to come back.
[01:03:37.488 --> 01:03:38.849]  I'm going to try to compose myself.
[01:03:39.809 --> 01:03:43.890]  And we're going to talk to Steve, Steve and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:03:45.957 --> 01:03:46.117]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:46.377 --> 01:03:47.498]  Stay with me.
[01:03:48.438 --> 01:03:57.382]  It's here.
[01:03:57.582 --> 01:04:02.364]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.724 --> 01:04:10.347]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:11.061 --> 01:04:18.125]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.525 --> 01:04:29.931]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.251 --> 01:04:33.773]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.214 --> 01:04:36.175]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.475 --> 01:04:40.257]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:55.219 --> 01:04:56.260]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.360]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:03.781]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.221 --> 01:05:05.041]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.361 --> 01:05:09.922]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.422 --> 01:05:12.545]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:13.045 --> 01:05:13.926]  Sheltering in place.
[01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:18.071]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[01:05:18.371 --> 01:05:25.019]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases,
[01:05:25.319 --> 01:05:34.883]  and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the US government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:35.183 --> 01:05:39.585]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[01:05:53.857 --> 01:06:00.672]  You want to lose weight, but there's no way you want to resort to pills or shakes that are full of chemicals or drugs with harmful side effects.
[01:06:01.164 --> 01:06:02.445]  We know diets don't work.
[01:06:02.745 --> 01:06:04.606]  That's why there's a Fat Loss Patch.
[01:06:04.786 --> 01:06:11.809]  The Fat Loss Patch is a self-adhesive dietary aid worn daily that slowly releases all natural ingredients into the skin.
[01:06:12.009 --> 01:06:19.512]  The result is a safe and easy way for you to increase your energy levels, maintain a healthy body weight, and curb those horrible sugar cravings.
[01:06:19.892 --> 01:06:22.653]  All without irritating side effects or loss of muscle.
[01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:25.775]  Just peel it off, stick it on, and live your life.
[01:06:26.255 --> 01:06:29.076]  The Patch is safe, effective, and clinically tested.
[01:06:29.236 --> 01:06:34.077]  Also, the Fat Loss Patch is the most unique product and business opportunity to ever hit the U.S.
[01:06:34.217 --> 01:06:35.358]  and international markets.
[01:06:35.838 --> 01:06:36.758]  Join as a U.S.

[01:06:45.681 --> 01:06:45.881]  That's 800-766-2133.
[01:06:54.958 --> 01:07:00.983]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.603 --> 01:07:04.645]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.267 --> 01:07:10.790]  You know, I just talked to that nice fella, Larry, in Idaho.
[01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:12.832]  He called back in and got back in.
[01:07:14.293 --> 01:07:15.194]  And it was what I thought.
[01:07:15.214 --> 01:07:17.115]  He started telling me about Nigeria.
[01:07:18.876 --> 01:07:20.758]  And he didn't believe me that
[01:07:22.435 --> 01:07:34.462]  That the emails you get from Nigeria, and then you send them a few thousand dollars, and they claim you're going to get 18 million, and then you call them back and they say, Shem Moore, and you're going to get it, and I... If people won't listen, I just can't help it anymore.
[01:07:34.502 --> 01:07:35.763]  That's why I blew up, okay?
[01:07:35.843 --> 01:07:36.983]  I just can't handle it.
[01:07:38.164 --> 01:07:42.787]  I just can't handle watching people get game run on them, over and over again.
[01:07:43.287 --> 01:07:49.771]  But it is the exact same thing with these Republicans following Republicans, and these Democrats calling Democrats.
[01:07:50.422 --> 01:07:51.402]  And following Democrats.
[01:07:51.802 --> 01:07:55.823]  How long, how many times are you going to get taken?
[01:07:57.763 --> 01:07:59.064]  How many times?
[01:08:00.824 --> 01:08:02.464]  I just, I don't understand it!
[01:08:03.284 --> 01:08:04.945]  I cannot understand it!
[01:08:07.905 --> 01:08:17.567]  I mean, it's flipping me out that the White House put out an announcement that they have Wahhabi, known Al Qaeda, I mean real Al Qaeda groups,
[01:08:19.793 --> 01:08:21.814]  Supposedly headed up by number three in Al-Qaeda.
[01:08:22.995 --> 01:08:24.296]  Attacking the Iranians.
[01:08:26.056 --> 01:08:30.899]  And then the news goes on and says Iran is Al-Qaeda and is attacking us with Al-Qaeda.
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:38.803]  When Al-Qaeda is known CIA and they're attacking the Iranians just like they attacked the Serbs.
[01:08:40.444 --> 01:08:41.605]  In the late 1980s.
[01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:43.666]  Republican Senate Report 2000.
[01:08:43.706 --> 01:08:44.066]  Admittedly.
[01:08:45.965 --> 01:08:50.988]  Bin Laden leading the forces out of Albania in the attacks against the Serbs.
[01:08:51.008 --> 01:08:54.251]  When the Serbs fought back, it was called genocide and the rest is history.
[01:08:54.511 --> 01:08:58.153]  And I'm not choosing sides of Croats and Serbs and all.
[01:08:58.213 --> 01:08:59.474]  I get threats from the Croats.
[01:08:59.494 --> 01:09:03.957]  How dare you, you know, say that the Serbs are good?
[01:09:04.738 --> 01:09:06.539]  I know you guys have been killing each other forever.
[01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:07.399]  I understand that.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:10.562]  I'm not even taking sides in all of that.
[01:09:11.082 --> 01:09:13.203]  The point is, is that Serbia got set up.
[01:09:14.044 --> 01:09:14.444]  Okay?
[01:09:15.005 --> 01:09:15.625]  That's the point.
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:17.121]  That I'm making.
[01:09:17.942 --> 01:09:20.706]  It doesn't change the facts which emotional side you're on.
[01:09:23.169 --> 01:09:23.729]  Oh, man.
[01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:27.234]  I mean, I actually try to study all these issues.
[01:09:27.734 --> 01:09:29.216]  And I don't even claim to have all the answers.
[01:09:29.296 --> 01:09:32.761]  But, I mean, it is just so transparent when Al-Qaeda
[01:09:33.525 --> 01:09:34.485]  Mainstream news!
[01:09:34.525 --> 01:09:36.066]  I mean, that's even mainstream headlines now.
[01:09:36.366 --> 01:09:41.567]  We first had that headline over a month ago, but now they've got mainstream headlines saying, Al-Qaeda attacking Iran.
[01:09:42.087 --> 01:09:44.387]  Al-Qaeda runs operations backed by U.S.
[01:09:44.867 --> 01:09:46.888]  I mean, you just, that is incredible!
[01:09:47.588 --> 01:09:54.729]  I gotta have stupid cops pull me over with my family, and ask to search the car, and I say no, and I go, why are you trying to violate my rights?
[01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:57.050]  Well, we're in a post-September 11th world.
[01:09:57.805 --> 01:10:01.709]  And I go, yeah, but you're told to let illegal aliens go, and then they look down at the ground.
[01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:05.573]  This is your excuse to run all over us, and I'm tired of it!
[01:10:05.593 --> 01:10:08.156]  300,000 cops 12 years ago.
[01:10:08.176 --> 01:10:08.416]  14 years ago.
[01:10:08.436 --> 01:10:08.736]  A million.
[01:10:15.524 --> 01:10:15.764]  In 2002.
[01:10:16.224 --> 01:10:18.866]  And now over a million and growing.
[01:10:19.086 --> 01:10:20.866]  And they're just hiring everywhere.
[01:10:21.287 --> 01:10:27.189]  I mean, I drive around in Austin, folks, and I'll see like five cops going around this corner, two here, three in a parking lot there, one here.
[01:10:27.409 --> 01:10:29.610]  It's like New York, man, where they're just everywhere.
[01:10:30.071 --> 01:10:32.892]  Standing around with their thumbs and their buckles looking at you.
[01:10:32.912 --> 01:10:36.473]  You know, with the penguin walk from foot to foot, bugging their eyes out.
[01:10:36.513 --> 01:10:38.074]  I mean, everybody sees it.
[01:10:38.414 --> 01:10:44.237]  So don't think all your billboards and all your propaganda and all your little public service announcements are working on us anymore.
[01:10:44.801 --> 01:10:46.442]  We see how you're building up against us.
[01:10:47.423 --> 01:10:48.624]  We know what's going on.
[01:10:48.945 --> 01:10:49.945]  We're not stupid.
[01:10:52.387 --> 01:10:54.009]  At least all of us aren't dumb as dirt.
[01:10:57.210 --> 01:11:06.958]  And look, I know there are a lot of police out there that listen to the show, that are anti-New World Order, that change old ladies' tires, and go to domestic disputes, and go to robberies at 7-Elevens, and got tough jobs.
[01:11:07.018 --> 01:11:14.003]  But I'm saying, more and more, they want thugs, they want scum, and you're out there violating our rights, and I'm sick of it.
[01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:18.626]  I'm a human being, my life has value, and I'm not here to be pushed around by you.
[01:11:18.847 --> 01:11:23.090]  And I don't break any of the laws that are out there, even your regulations, that are baloney.
[01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:29.113]  I even follow those so I can pass white glove inspection so I don't have to put up with any of your bull.
[01:11:29.313 --> 01:11:32.855]  And if you ever do try to set me up for something, it'll be clear that it's a setup.
[01:11:34.615 --> 01:11:39.438]  But I'm just, I'm gonna sit here and I'm gonna tell you that you are literally slitting your own throat.
[01:11:39.778 --> 01:11:42.099]  You're cutting your own noses off to spite your face.
[01:11:42.119 --> 01:11:43.360]  Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm ranting now.
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:44.820]  Stephen, California, go ahead.
[01:11:46.341 --> 01:11:46.661]  Hello.
[01:11:47.662 --> 01:11:48.762]  Hey, good news.
[01:11:49.502 --> 01:11:50.503]  Ron Paul online.
[01:11:51.263 --> 01:11:58.486]  We've got a exclusive interview with Ron Paul where he says, I am not a member of the CFR or Trilateral Commission.
[01:11:58.746 --> 01:12:04.868]  We've got about a two-minute clip off the homepage where he clearly delineates his... Alright, drop the plug, bro.
[01:12:05.108 --> 01:12:05.968]  Go ahead and drop the plug.
[01:12:06.949 --> 01:12:10.510]  RonPaulOnline.com, go to the feature section right on the homepage.
[01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:12.031]  There's a two-minute audio clip.
[01:12:12.151 --> 01:12:15.352]  But see, I'm going to tell you right now, that's going to backfire on you in a big way.
[01:12:16.306 --> 01:12:17.867]  You see, and I appreciate your call.
[01:12:18.308 --> 01:12:26.674]  You see, there's disinfo out there on the web where they go around and they say, and this is bad right here too, but let's just go ahead and do it.
[01:12:26.994 --> 01:12:28.695]  We don't learn, let's just be ourselves.
[01:12:28.956 --> 01:12:30.537]  Let's be the patriot movement, who we really are.
[01:12:30.557 --> 01:12:35.801]  I guess you could call us the beautiful losers.
[01:12:37.742 --> 01:12:38.062]  Alright?
[01:12:39.504 --> 01:12:41.305]  Now, let me break this down for everybody.
[01:12:42.341 --> 01:12:45.904]  They come out and they say Ron Paul is against net neutrality, he's against internet freedom.
[01:12:46.144 --> 01:12:54.131]  It's a total lie, but Ron Paul is going to spend his time responding and then the dumbed down public just hears he's against it and that's all that's left with them.
[01:12:55.732 --> 01:13:02.518]  Or there's disinfo out there saying that Ron Paul works for Count Cocoa Puffs
[01:13:03.599 --> 01:13:04.819]  Or he works for the Vatican.
[01:13:04.919 --> 01:13:05.680]  Total baloney.
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:07.120]  No fact.
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:08.840]  Doesn't matter to me even responding to that.
[01:13:09.181 --> 01:13:12.001]  To respond to the attack backfires.
[01:13:12.481 --> 01:13:12.862]  It's bad.
[01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.482]  You're not supposed to respond to it.
[01:13:14.942 --> 01:13:15.662]  Okay, but we're here.
[01:13:15.702 --> 01:13:16.062]  We will.
[01:13:16.102 --> 01:13:17.103]  We'll just go ahead and do it.
[01:13:17.583 --> 01:13:18.463]  Here, let me go further.
[01:13:18.783 --> 01:13:22.284]  Ron Paul, of course, has never been a member of the CFR or the Lateral Commission.
[01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:27.806]  Of course, he's always written books and done hundreds of speeches and spoken out against them and fought them.
[01:13:27.966 --> 01:13:29.226]  And that's a perfect voting record.
[01:13:29.975 --> 01:13:31.136]  What do you think they're going to do?
[01:13:31.557 --> 01:13:34.640]  All the disinfo people that attack me, of course they attack Ron Paul.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.982]  Of course they go out on the web and spread all these rumors.
[01:13:37.302 --> 01:13:49.495]  So you'll spend time fighting the rumors, which then only sends hits to their websites and their places, so more people then see the rumors, and then, oh, why won't Ron Paul answer this?
[01:13:49.835 --> 01:13:52.618]  Why won't Ron Paul respond to this?
[01:13:54.841 --> 01:14:04.450]  What I do is, 99.9% of the time, I've never responded to hit pieces from COINTELPRO operatives on the web posing as patriots, libertarians, or truth tellers.
[01:14:08.029 --> 01:14:21.995]  They've been good about not responding to it, and then they really get desperate and start saying, you know, I rip off people and kill people and I'm a murderer and I'm a top assassin.
[01:14:22.035 --> 01:14:26.156]  I mean, it just gets so ridiculous that they then totally brother credibility.
[01:14:26.936 --> 01:14:33.179]  Anyone who's dumb enough to respond to that... Listen, folks, when you hear some cockamamie stuff about somebody,
[01:14:34.284 --> 01:14:39.729]  Go Google it, go look it up, go try to find out if it's true, but then don't spread it around and ask a bunch of people if it's true.
[01:14:40.029 --> 01:14:41.310]  You go find out if it's true for yourself.
[01:14:42.191 --> 01:14:45.854]  The other thing is you have to learn how to recognize this stuff.
[01:14:45.894 --> 01:14:46.715]  It's shake and bake.
[01:14:47.075 --> 01:14:48.557]  It's cookie cutter, disinfo.
[01:14:49.678 --> 01:14:52.400]  The same thing they say about me, they say about every other real patriot.
[01:14:53.695 --> 01:15:09.224]  So instead of us fighting gun control legislation and North American Union legislation, instead of us rallying people to make copies of films and put bumper stickers on their cars and get involved and run for city office or... No, let me just talk about this right now.
[01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:10.205]  I'll just do it right now.
[01:15:12.966 --> 01:15:15.608]  The so-called Patriot Movement in this country
[01:15:17.941 --> 01:15:43.813]  That has been around for 50 years, that is the bulwark of resistance against the New World Order, that is the fount, the torchbearers of the Founding Fathers, that was made up of great military men and women, predominantly who have heard about the New World Order plans in the military, or members of Congress or their aides, who were inside Globalist meetings and saw Rand and Carnegie Endowment documents,
[01:15:45.146 --> 01:15:52.748]  They were scholarly focused, they warned the people, and they were demonized and called McCarthyites, basically.
[01:15:53.108 --> 01:15:55.028]  When they were actually exposing that it was bigger than that.
[01:15:55.288 --> 01:15:59.629]  You notice McCarthy was useful for the police state until he figured out there was a group above the Communists.
[01:15:59.949 --> 01:16:01.030]  Then, boy, you're out of there.
[01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:01.910]  Goodbye.
[01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:06.351]  When he found out the military was running Russia and staging the whole deal, it was over.
[01:16:07.671 --> 01:16:11.632]  Which is now a historical fact, and they admit that our government put Mao in, and that's even on History Channel.
[01:16:13.354 --> 01:16:15.875]  They've had, you know, New York Times articles saying McCarthy was right.
[01:16:16.476 --> 01:16:17.896]  He wasn't right about being a drunk.
[01:16:17.916 --> 01:16:19.757]  He wasn't right about going after innocent people.
[01:16:20.097 --> 01:16:23.739]  He wasn't right about setting up... Because you don't fight a police state with a police state.
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:29.842]  But, the point is, is that this movement was started to fight the New World Order to defend America.
[01:16:31.903 --> 01:16:32.923]  And it was infiltrated.
[01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:34.244]  Many other things happened to it.
[01:16:34.804 --> 01:16:36.505]  But it's the idea that matters.
[01:16:36.545 --> 01:16:37.745]  The manifesto that matters.
[01:16:37.986 --> 01:16:39.086]  The Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[01:16:39.126 --> 01:16:39.826]  It's the culture.
[01:16:40.127 --> 01:16:40.607]  It's you
[01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:44.872]  Taking what you want from a talk show host or a book and leaving the rest.
[01:16:45.592 --> 01:16:48.454]  It's not spending half the time.
[01:16:48.494 --> 01:16:49.734]  That's what the patron movement does.
[01:16:50.995 --> 01:16:53.216]  It spends half its time.
[01:16:54.477 --> 01:16:54.817]  Roughly.
[01:16:55.698 --> 01:16:56.099]  No, I'm not.
[01:17:13.112 --> 01:17:26.015]  Now the other half pulls the weight, wakes the people up, takes action, doesn't play games, stays highly motivated, is the only reason we got a prayer of even being in a holding pattern and a stalemate against the New World Order, which will lead to victory, by the way.
[01:17:29.696 --> 01:17:31.216]  And I'm not blaming you, caller.
[01:17:31.236 --> 01:17:31.877]  You're a good guy.
[01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:33.257]  You're starting a website for Ron Paul.
[01:17:33.277 --> 01:17:33.997]  We've had you plug it.
[01:17:34.017 --> 01:17:35.878]  You call in once a week or so and plug it fine.
[01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:36.338]  Dandy.
[01:17:38.638 --> 01:17:40.019]  Let me teach you how info works, though.
[01:17:40.039 --> 01:17:41.239]  Give us some info first.
[01:17:42.998 --> 01:17:47.980]  Comment about some news or something to capture our imagination and then plug your site and you'll get ten times the response.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.981]  Just dropping a plug in the middle of nowhere won't do anything.
[01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:56.563]  But then you say, oh, we're got him saying he's not part of the CFR, the Trilateral Commission.
[01:17:57.844 --> 01:17:59.544]  That'll just create some controversy.
[01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:09.308]  In fact, I don't even think I'll link to that or promote that because even though it would get a bunch of hits on my website and be a controversy, I'm not going to promote something that will actually backfire.
[01:18:10.234 --> 01:18:11.875]  Other people will run off and do it, and that's fine.
[01:18:14.717 --> 01:18:17.158]  And again, I'm not telling you how to think or what to do or how to live.
[01:18:17.218 --> 01:18:20.420]  Be wise as serpents and peaceful as doves.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.701]  Walk gently to carry a big stick.
[01:18:22.721 --> 01:18:24.802]  I mean, you can put it however you want.
[01:18:25.482 --> 01:18:26.743]  But you've got to have some discernment.
[01:18:27.323 --> 01:18:35.568]  And I'm telling you, you need to be exposed to the New World Order, the trillions missing from the Pentagon, the white slavery rings, the corruption, the plunging dollar.
[01:18:37.516 --> 01:18:45.341]  Ron Paul is not going to win if we pick up the COINTELPRO attacks and then make that the major focus.
[01:18:46.261 --> 01:18:49.083]  Next the headline will be Ron Paul under fire from his own camp.
[01:18:55.504 --> 01:18:59.985]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:19:00.325 --> 01:19:04.427]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:19:04.707 --> 01:19:05.267]  We listened.
[01:19:05.567 --> 01:19:10.549]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:11.329]  We listened.
[01:19:11.709 --> 01:19:14.730]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:15.170 --> 01:19:15.690]  We listened.
[01:19:16.170 --> 01:19:18.831]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping.
[01:19:18.951 --> 01:19:21.074]  And during power outages, we listened.
[01:19:21.434 --> 01:19:26.681]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:19:27.082 --> 01:19:28.444]  Again, we listened.
[01:19:28.804 --> 01:19:30.386]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[01:19:30.586 --> 01:19:36.134]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:19:36.594 --> 01:19:39.236]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[01:19:39.416 --> 01:19:39.616]  Only $279.
[01:19:39.656 --> 01:19:40.216]  Call New Millennium, 888-03-4438.
[01:19:40.316 --> 01:19:40.616]  That's 888-03-4438.
[01:19:40.677 --> 01:19:41.957]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:42.718]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:53.640]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:53.961]  July 11, 2007.
[01:19:54.021 --> 01:19:54.161]  Gold 660, 330.
[01:19:54.241 --> 01:19:56.361]  Onscore coins can be purchased for $684.73, $337.85 for half, $168.93 for quarter.
[01:19:56.401 --> 01:19:56.882]  That's $684.73, $337.85, and $168.93.
[01:19:56.922 --> 01:19:58.482]  70% of China's one trillion reserves are in dollar.
[01:19:58.502 --> 01:20:00.463]  Now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[01:20:00.483 --> 01:20:01.904]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[01:20:01.944 --> 01:20:02.364]  Bad news for U.S.
[01:20:02.384 --> 01:20:02.684]  currency.
[01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:21.351]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[01:20:21.511 --> 01:20:22.952]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[01:20:23.212 --> 01:20:25.293]  Dollars fall into 65% of Euro.
[01:20:25.433 --> 01:20:26.513]  Erosion accelerates.
[01:20:26.693 --> 01:20:29.235]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of the U.S.
[01:20:29.395 --> 01:20:31.315]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[01:20:31.476 --> 01:20:33.997]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[01:20:34.197 --> 01:20:35.137]  Why attack Iran?
[01:20:35.257 --> 01:20:38.279]  Jerome O'Coursey's Iran leads attack against the U.S.
[01:20:38.319 --> 01:20:39.759]  dollar document spells it out.
[01:20:39.879 --> 01:20:41.920]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:45.822]  The value of your hard-earned money is being destroyed in a global game of chess.
[01:20:46.042 --> 01:20:49.505]  Call 800-686-2237 for Corsi's report today.
[01:20:49.605 --> 01:20:52.127]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.127 --> 01:20:54.909]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:20:55.009 --> 01:20:56.330]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:20:56.490 --> 01:20:59.312]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.

[01:21:52.188 --> 01:21:54.909]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[01:21:55.349 --> 01:22:01.012]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[01:22:01.492 --> 01:22:03.633]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[01:22:03.813 --> 01:22:13.037]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[01:22:13.337 --> 01:22:17.559]  With more than 500 vital functions, give your liver the helping hand it needs
[01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:18.139]  I think so.

[01:22:41.753 --> 01:22:42.994]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:23:03.789 --> 01:23:08.531]  In 1914 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[01:23:08.571 --> 01:23:13.614]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[01:23:13.754 --> 01:23:16.475]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[01:23:16.715 --> 01:23:19.136]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[01:23:19.416 --> 01:23:21.898]  We fired once more and they forget to run it.
[01:23:22.178 --> 01:23:24.399]  On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.602]  Look, I'm gonna get to Steve, Kyle, Kevin, Caleb, and everybody.
[01:23:30.662 --> 01:23:31.602]  Open phones today.
[01:23:31.622 --> 01:23:35.984]  The key issues get brought up, and I gotta say I'm a little bit irritable today, but uh...
[01:23:56.684 --> 01:24:02.148]  I mean, I've just been doing this so long, continually, full-time, that I figured out how a few things work.
[01:24:03.589 --> 01:24:08.192]  Now, I instinctively never in-fought with people, and that's one reason I was successful in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:24:08.853 --> 01:24:10.414]  Because I've just never been what I'm about.
[01:24:11.915 --> 01:24:18.660]  I don't spend my time ninnying and gossiping on the phone like, frankly, most members of the Patriot Movement do in leadership positions.
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:20.281]  I mean, that's basically what they do.
[01:24:21.301 --> 01:24:26.265]  I'm off writing books, making films, getting the word out, starting new websites while old people ninny.
[01:24:27.977 --> 01:24:29.479]  That's what most people do in this movement.
[01:24:29.499 --> 01:24:37.085]  I mean, it must be every month I get a call from some new up-and-coming group or person saying, uh, I got an idea, Alex.
[01:24:37.565 --> 01:24:43.270]  You're going to go under my group's umbrella and you're going to, and oh, you won't come under our control.
[01:24:45.512 --> 01:24:47.373]  See, it's all about somebody wanting to be a big shot.
[01:24:48.334 --> 01:24:50.196]  No, see, I don't want to be a big shot.
[01:24:50.236 --> 01:24:56.461]  I get in bed every night and think about how close I am to them killing me and the ways they're trying to set me up and the stuff they pull.
[01:24:57.967 --> 01:24:58.287]  Okay?
[01:24:58.587 --> 01:25:08.229]  I mean, you know, I've got to get fired up and gut up every day to continue my focus and never let one micron of fear creep in from our victory against the New World Order.
[01:25:08.529 --> 01:25:24.813]  Meanwhile, I watch a bunch of children, and I'm not talking about you, the listeners, or the activists, or that young man, that old woman, that black man, that Hispanic person, it doesn't matter, all over the country, who are fighting and getting the word out and taking action, and don't get discouraged by all the disinfo and all the spew.
[01:25:25.493 --> 01:25:27.635]  Ron Paul has earned our respect.
[01:25:27.935 --> 01:25:29.616]  Ron Paul has earned our trust.
[01:25:30.617 --> 01:25:32.418]  And I've gotten the baloney in my email.
[01:25:32.478 --> 01:25:35.981]  Ron Paul's a CFR member, Vatican assassin.
[01:25:37.502 --> 01:25:41.424]  By the way, he's a Protestant and he's not on the CFR membership list.
[01:25:41.725 --> 01:25:42.485]  It's made up.
[01:25:43.126 --> 01:25:44.086]  Then I get emails later.
[01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:45.888]  Why won't you respond to this?
[01:25:46.148 --> 01:25:48.429]  Why won't you deal with this rumor?
[01:25:50.031 --> 01:25:52.092]  That's why I kind of blow up them when I get a call about it.
[01:25:52.532 --> 01:25:53.453]  It's because it is baseless.
[01:25:55.774 --> 01:26:05.196]  And then now instead of talking about how to get Ron Paul elected when he has a chance of winning, how to, how to take this country back, it'd be basically like the Alamo.
[01:26:05.236 --> 01:26:17.058]  We're getting rushed by the foreign troops and then we start having, and then some dissenter in our ranks, some spy, says, maybe we shouldn't trust Colonel Travis or Jim Booley or Davy Crockett.
[01:26:17.318 --> 01:26:19.298]  Maybe they work for Santa Ana!
[01:26:20.718 --> 01:26:21.959]  It's Davy Crockett!
[01:26:22.239 --> 01:26:23.839]  He doesn't work for Santa Ana!
[01:26:24.537 --> 01:26:26.998]  They'll be like Andrew Jackson when he's fighting the British.
[01:26:27.378 --> 01:26:29.039]  What was it down in New Orleans?
[01:26:29.059 --> 01:26:30.140]  About 5, 6 to 1?
[01:26:31.881 --> 01:26:35.623]  Maybe Andrew Jackson, maybe he's with the British.
[01:26:35.863 --> 01:26:37.624]  That's what the British would say!
[01:26:38.224 --> 01:26:39.585]  That's what they do!
[01:26:40.965 --> 01:26:42.206]  Don't you understand that?
[01:26:42.546 --> 01:26:44.087]  It's like, let's say I'm in a church house.
[01:26:44.147 --> 01:26:44.667]  I'm a preacher.
[01:26:44.687 --> 01:26:45.648]  It's a Revolutionary War.
[01:26:46.048 --> 01:26:47.168]  My name's John Brown.
[01:26:49.089 --> 01:26:50.150]  Preacher of the Revolutionary War.
[01:26:51.525 --> 01:26:57.387]  And I'm up there saying, they're coming down from Lexington, they're coming down from Concord, you've heard Patrick Henry speak!
[01:26:58.588 --> 01:26:59.368]  From Virginia!
[01:26:59.868 --> 01:27:02.789]  The war's already on, we gotta get out there and we gotta fight them!
[01:27:03.289 --> 01:27:07.631]  And you know there were Tories in the audience who said, maybe you just wanna do this and that!
[01:27:07.831 --> 01:27:08.911]  Maybe you're with them!
[01:27:09.151 --> 01:27:11.212]  Maybe you wanna just get us in trouble!
[01:27:11.832 --> 01:27:16.274]  Maybe you're... When John Brown never had any history of doing anything but fighting tyranny.
[01:27:17.034 --> 01:27:23.656]  I mean, if you can't take Ron Paul with a perfect voting record, and then it... The telephone people and then the people they snowball.
[01:27:23.956 --> 01:27:25.717]  By snowball, you know, it rolls, it gets bigger.
[01:27:25.937 --> 01:27:26.737]  It's Mockingbird.
[01:27:26.957 --> 01:27:28.398]  That's why the CIA called it Mockingbird.
[01:27:28.578 --> 01:27:32.599]  They have a few key people in media say something, put something out, then everybody starts parroting it.
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.520]  Snowballing it as it gets bigger and bigger.
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:41.242]  Oh, why don't you respond to, uh, to Ron Paul?
[01:27:43.623 --> 01:27:47.244]  He's now denied he's a member of the CFR.
[01:27:48.224 --> 01:27:50.285]  Poor guy gets called up for an interview, he gives it.
[01:27:53.666 --> 01:27:58.727]  I mean, I've seen Ron Paul give interviews to people on the net who have like 300 total views a month or something.
[01:27:59.187 --> 01:28:05.188]  The guy's, I don't know about the strategy, whatever, but it's hard to get him on coast-to-coast AM, but we did.
[01:28:06.609 --> 01:28:11.110]  All I know, he has 16 million listeners, all I know is that
[01:28:13.488 --> 01:28:17.390]  I can't spend my time, and every few months I'll do a little rant for you on this subject.
[01:28:17.770 --> 01:28:20.711]  I cannot, I will not, have a nanny fest.
[01:28:21.991 --> 01:28:22.952]  I will never do it.
[01:28:23.412 --> 01:28:25.033]  The enemy is the New World Order.
[01:28:25.313 --> 01:28:25.973]  Move forward.
[01:28:26.033 --> 01:28:27.234]  You know your heart's pure.
[01:28:27.554 --> 01:28:29.154]  You know you're not controlled by the New World Order.
[01:28:29.515 --> 01:28:33.956]  You quit worrying about whether Joe Blow is, and you take action.
[01:28:34.016 --> 01:28:35.097]  No more excuses.
[01:28:35.497 --> 01:28:38.998]  The Feds know they're planting excuses for you to not take action.
[01:28:40.139 --> 01:28:41.439]  I'm just sick of the whole thing.
[01:28:41.499 --> 01:28:42.340]  I'm going home.
[01:28:44.185 --> 01:28:45.086]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.587 --> 01:28:47.209]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:50.874]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.338 --> 01:28:56.841]  Do you know that you can go solar for under 1200 bucks now?
[01:28:57.382 --> 01:28:58.503]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[01:28:58.704 --> 01:29:02.829]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:29:03.439 --> 01:29:08.322]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[01:29:08.822 --> 01:29:15.266]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more!
[01:29:16.005 --> 01:29:18.707]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[01:29:18.867 --> 01:29:28.835]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[01:29:29.115 --> 01:29:32.818]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[01:29:32.878 --> 01:29:39.363]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[01:29:39.543 --> 01:29:40.584]  Are you ready to go solar?
[01:29:40.784 --> 01:29:41.744]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.

[01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:57.031]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.
[01:29:57.211 --> 01:29:59.952]  We are now offering a critically important $10 package.
[01:30:00.132 --> 01:30:12.737]  The package contains 3 DVDs with 10 different programs, our new 658-page book called The Truth About What Really Happened to the Catholic Church After Vatican II, which is the most comprehensive book ever produced on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[01:30:13.377 --> 01:30:13.737]  I think so.
[01:30:35.493 --> 01:30:36.514]  Are you lacking energy on a daily basis?
[01:30:36.554 --> 01:30:37.595]  Do you feel tired all the
[01:31:00.253 --> 01:31:00.513]  I think so.
[01:31:20.131 --> 01:31:20.871]  We're good to go.
[01:31:42.662 --> 01:31:44.887]  And become a free dealer wholesale member.
[01:31:45.007 --> 01:31:52.444]  That's GCNlive.com, sponsors link, ACT banner and experience ACT, the healthy feel-good energy drink today!
[01:32:32.154 --> 01:32:34.436]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:32:34.456 --> 01:32:38.638]  Let's try to now shift gears into serious issues, if we could.
[01:32:39.739 --> 01:32:42.901]  And I know a lot of people aren't going to take my advice on how to have Ron Paul win.
[01:32:43.341 --> 01:32:47.864]  Let me just give some positive news on Ron Paul, which I meant to do in the first hour right now, then we'll go to your calls.
[01:32:48.504 --> 01:32:55.869]  Shifting into what matters, and how winners operate, and how we can effectively fight the New World Order.
[01:32:58.872 --> 01:33:02.293]  Ron Paul was in the front page of the Statesman yesterday here in Austin.
[01:33:02.313 --> 01:33:03.054]  Now what does that mean?
[01:33:03.074 --> 01:33:09.376]  The Statesman is one of the most backward, most pro-New World Order, establishment shell operations in existence.
[01:33:09.396 --> 01:33:12.097]  It's one of the worst papers in the country.
[01:33:12.877 --> 01:33:17.339]  And it had front page saying Ron Paul is a phenomenon and does have massive support.
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:24.422]  So these little arrogant statements from Stephanopoulos Sunday about, no you will lose, no there's no way you will win.
[01:33:24.822 --> 01:33:27.323]  Well yeah, if you just listen to the enemy's propaganda,
[01:33:27.981 --> 01:33:33.386]  Telling you that you can't affect change, you can't fight City Hall, lay down GI, it's all over for you.
[01:33:34.667 --> 01:33:37.250]  If you believe that, there is no way you can ever win.
[01:33:37.490 --> 01:33:40.072]  And we believe that propaganda in this movement.
[01:33:40.553 --> 01:33:41.253]  We believed it.
[01:33:41.954 --> 01:33:45.377]  Most of us have bought into it at one time or another.
[01:33:45.417 --> 01:33:47.039]  I'm here to tell you, it's a fraud and it's a lie.
[01:33:49.364 --> 01:33:51.264]  And people say, well, what about the die-mold machines?
[01:33:51.304 --> 01:33:53.205]  They're in place in about 35% of the country.
[01:33:53.245 --> 01:34:00.487]  There is fraud going on, but we still have to get in the arena, even if it's a gladiatorial fight and they got a shield and a trident and all we got's a short sword.
[01:34:01.087 --> 01:34:08.769]  We gotta go in there and maybe even take the trident in the shoulder, as long as we can still just jam that knife right up underneath the New World Order's throat.
[01:34:08.789 --> 01:34:11.529]  I mean, it doesn't mean we're not gonna get hurt in this thing.
[01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:14.510]  But you just gut up and go after it,
[01:34:16.152 --> 01:34:20.335]  And start roaring like a rhinoceros and run over somebody, he'll get done real quick!
[01:34:21.315 --> 01:34:23.517]  We're gonna win this thing one way or the other!
[01:34:24.337 --> 01:34:25.959]  I'm absolutely assured of that!
[01:34:29.521 --> 01:34:31.462]  Because they're the aggressor, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:33.003 --> 01:34:42.029]  And all throughout history, the aggressor looks like they're winning at first, but then they start losing in every case because they're scum, they're parasites, they don't produce anything.
[01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:43.150]  They're going down!
[01:34:45.638 --> 01:34:49.659]  And you just gotta get past your fear and stop caring what your neighbors, your friends, your family think.
[01:34:49.679 --> 01:34:52.420]  You gotta start walking tall and telling it like it is.
[01:34:54.701 --> 01:35:10.986]  Now, Las Vegas had him at 200 to 1, then 15 to 1, then 5 to 1, and then they said, and this is several different houses, some of the biggest, the big NFL firm that does most of the NFL analysis, they said only Ron Paul
[01:35:11.829 --> 01:35:14.009]  They've got subscribers, folks, for millions of dollars.
[01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:17.670]  If they start making even a few mistakes, people unsubscribe.
[01:35:17.970 --> 01:35:19.371]  They've got to be accurate.
[01:35:19.411 --> 01:35:22.991]  And some of the biggest betting ever made is on presidential elections.
[01:35:23.311 --> 01:35:30.013]  And they're saying Ron Paul is the frontrunner in the Republican field.
[01:35:33.134 --> 01:35:34.814]  And they're saying something more important.
[01:35:35.394 --> 01:35:39.755]  They're saying only Ron Paul can beat Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama.
[01:35:41.394 --> 01:35:43.475]  Now, they don't get into the deeper analysis.
[01:35:43.495 --> 01:35:46.037]  This is exactly what we told you months before Las Vegas said it.
[01:35:46.477 --> 01:35:47.777]  Because I know politics, folks.
[01:35:48.078 --> 01:35:49.758]  I've got good political instincts, and I study it.
[01:35:50.479 --> 01:35:52.300]  I study this whole false paradigm.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:58.123]  And in it, we are like sending a probe of reality back into the unreality.
[01:35:58.803 --> 01:35:59.784]  Back into the theater.
[01:36:02.945 --> 01:36:09.609]  This is like they're having a thespian play that's obscene, and Ron Paul's a policeman coming in to break up the play.
[01:36:11.616 --> 01:36:15.898]  Okay, I mean, this is reality coming into the Matrix.
[01:36:17.139 --> 01:36:20.941]  This is Neo, or V, showing up in the middle of the fraud.
[01:36:21.221 --> 01:36:30.547]  This is Ron Paul resonating with the popular rage, discontent, and the shattered left-right paradigm bore out by scientific polls.
[01:36:32.588 --> 01:36:38.031]  And so Ron Paul, they tell you he can't win, he's nobody, he's second tier, and he raises
[01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:41.868]  Three million dollars more than John McCain.
[01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:46.092]  They were telling you three, four months ago was the frontrunner.
[01:36:47.853 --> 01:36:50.055]  John McCain never has any intention of winning.
[01:36:50.375 --> 01:36:53.698]  John McCain is a yes man.
[01:36:54.678 --> 01:36:58.101]  Giuliani, McCain, all of them, Mitt Romney, none of it is real.
[01:36:59.162 --> 01:37:01.163]  It's just like Bob Dole in 96 Against Clinton.
[01:37:01.444 --> 01:37:02.725]  They power share.
[01:37:02.965 --> 01:37:05.827]  You've heard Ron Paul's campaign chairman agree on this show.
[01:37:06.738 --> 01:37:18.366]  That the Republicans mean to do unpopular things and pass full power to the Democrats for a unified party structure to ram through every nightmare amnesty, gun control bills.
[01:37:19.266 --> 01:37:22.548]  They already passed the biggest gun control bills in 68 a month ago.
[01:37:22.588 --> 01:37:23.469]  Nobody even knows about it.
[01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:28.072]  I mean, a reign of terror to begin in 2009.
[01:37:29.633 --> 01:37:30.473]  You think it's been bad?
[01:37:30.513 --> 01:37:31.574]  No, it's going to get worse.
[01:37:31.734 --> 01:37:32.835]  Each new world war president
[01:37:34.525 --> 01:37:35.346]  You think Bush Sr.'
[01:37:35.326 --> 01:37:35.666]  's bad?
[01:37:35.726 --> 01:37:36.506]  Oh, here's Bill Clinton.
[01:37:36.687 --> 01:37:37.647]  You think Bill Clinton's bad?
[01:37:37.687 --> 01:37:38.448]  Here's George Bush.
[01:37:38.648 --> 01:37:39.829]  You think George Bush is bad?
[01:37:39.869 --> 01:37:40.669]  Here's Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:40.889 --> 01:37:41.970]  Here's Barack Obama.
[01:37:42.450 --> 01:37:44.112]  Here's Bilderberg boy John Edwards.
[01:37:44.152 --> 01:37:45.413]  Don't think he won't come roaring back.
[01:37:45.433 --> 01:37:49.795]  I mean, you want to know cold, hard facts, here it is.
[01:37:51.597 --> 01:37:57.741]  The Republicans are running dead horses in this race who've got a billion skeletons in their collective closets.
[01:37:59.189 --> 01:38:01.971]  They are passing the buck.
[01:38:02.271 --> 01:38:03.932]  You are seeing the fix being in.
[01:38:04.232 --> 01:38:13.977]  And in comes Ron Paul, and he says it's a hundred times better than I thought it would be on Face the Nation, or this week, whatever it is with that idiot Stephanopoulos.
[01:38:14.317 --> 01:38:15.838]  This week with Stephanopoulos.
[01:38:17.439 --> 01:38:19.580]  Yeah, it used to be this week with David Brinkley, now it's Stephanopoulos.
[01:38:25.476 --> 01:38:41.881]  Instead of us talking about Ron Paul surging, leading, history being made here, I'm getting a bunch of ninnying emails about fixed elections, and is he a co-agitator of the Pope, or is he a CFR member, or I heard he's for shutting down the web.
[01:38:41.901 --> 01:38:43.642]  That is pure baloney.
[01:38:44.662 --> 01:38:48.003]  I've watched him on the floor debate and push for net freedom.
[01:38:49.203 --> 01:38:50.244]  I've seen his votes.
[01:38:50.324 --> 01:38:51.344]  We know his votes.
[01:38:52.603 --> 01:38:54.003]  We've got his voting record!
[01:38:54.264 --> 01:38:58.845]  But you cannot, with even the Patriot Movement, a large section of it, explain that to them!
[01:38:58.905 --> 01:38:59.765]  They don't care!
[01:39:00.085 --> 01:39:12.529]  They have been COINTELPRO-FED to ninny and run around and squabble and talk trash about people so long, and I understand, I mean, I'm cynical too, this country's falling apart, but I mean, you've got to consider the sources.
[01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:21.592]  So all that aside, here is even the Congressional staffer, the minion, the new old order shill, who sees that the Republicans are in deep trouble, just like
[01:39:23.003 --> 01:39:26.366]  The other guy is doing on MSNBC, Tucker Carlson.
[01:39:26.786 --> 01:39:30.990]  Here is the guy that took over the morning show that Imus was doing.
[01:39:31.670 --> 01:39:36.274]  Scarborough, Mr. BDI, calling Ron Paul the next President of the United States.
[01:39:36.294 --> 01:39:36.634]  Here it is.
[01:39:38.334 --> 01:39:40.175]  There's Mika.
[01:39:40.675 --> 01:39:41.556]  Cut it.
[01:39:41.816 --> 01:39:43.137]  Are we on the air?
[01:39:43.177 --> 01:39:44.518]  We are on the air.
[01:39:44.558 --> 01:39:45.618]  Why are you late?
[01:39:45.699 --> 01:39:48.540]  We're just kind of on the air.
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:55.084]  We've got the next president of the United States on the phone right now.
[01:39:55.164 --> 01:39:55.244]  Oh!
[01:39:55.284 --> 01:39:56.925]  My goodness!
[01:39:56.945 --> 01:39:57.646]  We do, don't we?
[01:40:01.508 --> 01:40:01.948]  Okay.
[01:40:01.988 --> 01:40:08.150]  This is, by the way, Manfred Mann's Blinded by the Light in the mid-seventies.
[01:40:08.370 --> 01:40:09.311]  Great song.
[01:40:09.331 --> 01:40:09.671]  Yeah.
[01:40:09.831 --> 01:40:13.492]  Great song, but I just love Bruce Springsteen's version.
[01:40:13.592 --> 01:40:15.833]  I'm curious about the Manfred Mann version.
[01:40:16.013 --> 01:40:17.133]  There's 11 minutes of it.
[01:40:17.173 --> 01:40:23.975]  I may air more of it in the next hour, but the point is, the next President of the United States, the statesman's saying maybe he can win.
[01:40:25.116 --> 01:40:26.496]  You see, they are getting scared.
[01:40:26.516 --> 01:40:28.617]  He's going to make Perot look like a flash in the pan.
[01:40:29.916 --> 01:40:33.698]  And I don't think you can call Ron Paul up and threaten to kill his kids and have him turn back.
[01:40:34.078 --> 01:40:35.819]  We've already talked about that on air with the Congressman.
[01:40:36.099 --> 01:40:37.359]  By the way, it's scheduled to be on tomorrow.
[01:40:40.621 --> 01:40:44.642]  So see, let's get serious and let's get behind Ron Paul.
[01:40:45.402 --> 01:40:55.307]  And let's... I mean, if they're gonna steal the election, let's make them do it in New Hampshire where he's winning in polls, but loses by 15-20%.
[01:40:55.327 --> 01:40:56.127]  Where he's winning in Ohio,
[01:40:59.346 --> 01:41:03.547]  But then, in the polls, but then losing on the other side.
[01:41:04.247 --> 01:41:10.409]  I mean, let's make them show everyone, just like 90 plus percent of us don't want open borders, they still push for it.
[01:41:10.429 --> 01:41:16.230]  90 plus percent of us, I don't want the war, it's 80 plus percent, they still go with it.
[01:41:16.890 --> 01:41:20.931]  I mean, let's continue the process of showing everyone.
[01:41:22.832 --> 01:41:28.213]  And regardless, I mean, if you're going to lay down and die, and just say we can't beat them, then you might as well just give up, folks.
[01:41:29.722 --> 01:41:31.403]  It's the whole action of fighting.
[01:41:31.583 --> 01:41:32.904]  Let's say Ron Paul doesn't win.
[01:41:33.724 --> 01:41:35.025]  He's educated the country.
[01:41:35.065 --> 01:41:36.866]  He's injected real issues into the debate.
[01:41:37.126 --> 01:41:38.887]  He's shown how both parties are a fraud.
[01:41:41.969 --> 01:41:52.154]  He has shown people that a true libertarian conservative can have a serious run and then encourage others for the philosophy of liberty.
[01:41:52.354 --> 01:41:53.955]  I mean, you have to at least have that attitude.
[01:41:53.975 --> 01:41:54.235]  And look!
[01:41:54.495 --> 01:41:57.297]  He's positioning himself to win the nomination!
[01:42:00.143 --> 01:42:01.684]  And the argument is, well, they'll kill him.
[01:42:01.724 --> 01:42:05.326]  Well, he's 74 years old, and he said, that's what they do, that's what they do!
[01:42:06.567 --> 01:42:08.428]  He's a veteran, he's a soldier, he's a man!
[01:42:08.608 --> 01:42:09.609]  That's what men do!
[01:42:09.909 --> 01:42:11.590]  Men put themselves in that position!
[01:42:12.931 --> 01:42:15.432]  If it's for their people, their tribe, their country.
[01:42:20.315 --> 01:42:26.339]  So, Ron Paul can win the presidency, and he can certainly give them a good run for their money.
[01:42:28.593 --> 01:42:35.918]  I mean, I'm of the mind that it might be some 300-pound championship, you know, jiu-jitsu kickboxer who eats nails for breakfast.
[01:42:36.959 --> 01:42:44.544]  And I'm certainly not going to start a fight with them, but if they assault me, I mean, I'm going to kick like a mule and I'm going to bite like a crocodile in the words of Johnny Cash.
[01:42:49.528 --> 01:42:55.452]  I mean, they may be breaking my arm off, but while they're doing it, I'm going to reach right over with full force and bite a gigantic chunk out of their body.
[01:42:58.763 --> 01:43:04.725]  I mean, I've told everybody, they start trying to get people to FEMA camps, you know, uh, the Mr. Nice Guy stuff goes right out the window, too!
[01:43:05.505 --> 01:43:16.689]  And with me, that isn't a bunch of, a bunch of talk, you know, I don't sit around shooting my mouth off about physical force all day on this show, like all these people that are always calling for it, who never do it, who you know are COINTELPRO or idiots.
[01:43:18.529 --> 01:43:18.889]  Or both.
[01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:27.152]  This isn't a joke, this isn't a game, this is Mortal Kombat, with the New World Order, toe-to-toe.
[01:43:29.494 --> 01:43:30.474]  And I'm going to tell you something.
[01:43:30.634 --> 01:43:34.455]  You look at those polls of 80-plus and 90-plus percent being anti-New World Order.
[01:43:34.475 --> 01:43:40.177]  Let me tell you, we now are getting high numbers in the FBI, high numbers in police, high numbers in air workers.
[01:43:40.197 --> 01:43:42.157]  They're realizing they don't have any future either.
[01:43:42.897 --> 01:43:47.498]  There were a lot of Germans and a lot of Nazis and a lot of military people who went along with Hitler at first.
[01:43:47.939 --> 01:43:49.899]  But even by 42, it looked like he was winning.
[01:43:50.179 --> 01:43:51.980]  They were going, man, this isn't going to go too good.
[01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:52.860]  This guy's nuts.
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:55.080]  This isn't going to be too good.
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:57.841]  This isn't good for my children's future.
[01:43:58.809 --> 01:44:01.290]  And I just want to tell the police and the military and everybody else that.
[01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:04.131]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[01:44:05.412 --> 01:44:06.912]  And you better pick a side.
[01:44:06.952 --> 01:44:08.553]  You can't be on the fence on this.
[01:44:09.593 --> 01:44:10.774]  I'm telling you, choose!
[01:44:11.834 --> 01:44:14.916]  Your gut, your soul, your heart wants to join us.
[01:44:15.316 --> 01:44:16.436]  You want to join Ron Paul.
[01:44:17.637 --> 01:44:18.477]  You want to join me.
[01:44:19.458 --> 01:44:21.558]  You want to join other patriots in your community.
[01:44:21.598 --> 01:44:22.959]  You want to be a good American.
[01:44:23.219 --> 01:44:25.400]  And you know what we're seeing today isn't America.
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:32.445]  North American unions and overrun by foreigners who are highly nationalistic and anti-U.S.
[01:44:34.707 --> 01:44:36.368]  You crave liberty yourself.
[01:44:37.229 --> 01:44:38.650]  You crave freedom, many of you.
[01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:40.912]  A lot of you aren't psychopaths turned over to evil.
[01:44:42.268 --> 01:44:52.637]  Some of you have gotten into evil, but now the light that you used to shrink from is so distant that it's like a jewel you wish you could reach out for, but you feel like you can never get back to it.
[01:44:52.677 --> 01:44:53.178]  You can.
[01:44:53.418 --> 01:44:54.339]  You can repent.
[01:44:54.899 --> 01:44:56.881]  You can come back to humanity.
[01:44:57.161 --> 01:44:59.283]  You can come back to the light, away from evil.
[01:45:01.365 --> 01:45:02.266]  It's not too late.
[01:45:03.347 --> 01:45:05.809]  And I tell you, the biggest problem we face is these phony churches.
[01:45:07.245 --> 01:45:26.992]  Because they tell everybody it's the end of the world, there's nothing you can do, go along with the evil, don't warn your neighbors, just go to your church and worship war, and let your preachers that are bought and paid for by foreign governments tell you what to do, and it's all a foregone conclusion, and go in your prayer closet and just don't worry about anything.
[01:45:28.072 --> 01:45:31.874]  Regardless of what's happening in the future, we have a duty to stand up against evil.
[01:45:32.154 --> 01:45:33.794]  We have a duty to stand up for this country.
[01:45:34.334 --> 01:45:35.735]  And I don't like your cop-outs.
[01:45:38.539 --> 01:45:42.301]  And that's the biggest thing holding this Republic back.
[01:45:42.902 --> 01:45:45.483]  Is that you have decided that you can't beat City Hall.
[01:45:45.803 --> 01:45:47.744]  You've decided to retreat from evil.
[01:45:48.185 --> 01:45:49.606]  You've decided to give in.
[01:45:50.646 --> 01:45:54.428]  And you think you're safe and you go, I'm just going to trust in Jesus.
[01:45:56.530 --> 01:45:57.790]  Have you read the Bible lately?
[01:45:57.930 --> 01:45:59.171]  What's in the Old Testament and the New?
[01:45:59.892 --> 01:46:02.033]  All it is is people going head up against evil.
[01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:03.821]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[01:46:04.221 --> 01:46:08.385]  Digging in the wall like Ezekiel and exposing the evil going on with the secret societies.
[01:46:08.685 --> 01:46:11.568]  Standing up against the corrupt government minions.
[01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:16.612]  They take Romans 13 and twist it when that's not even what it's about.
[01:46:16.632 --> 01:46:20.875]  Alright, I've been ranting, I said I'd take calls.
[01:46:21.276 --> 01:46:23.037]  Steve in Chicago, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[01:46:24.378 --> 01:46:28.622]  You're a good man, I agree with 97% of what you say, but there are three issues I want to bring up.
[01:46:29.156 --> 01:46:31.158]  Sometimes I think you're pretty hard on the Germans.
[01:46:31.558 --> 01:46:35.621]  Number one, the English invented the concentration camps in 1899 to 1902.
[01:46:35.902 --> 01:46:36.822]  That's true!
[01:46:37.003 --> 01:46:37.903]  That's actually true!
[01:46:38.384 --> 01:46:38.884]  Yeah, right.
[01:46:38.984 --> 01:46:40.466]  And you can see the pictures on the internet.
[01:46:40.826 --> 01:46:46.090]  Number two, you keep saying that the Germans are pulling strings, but how much do you talk about the St.
[01:46:46.110 --> 01:46:48.412]  James Secret Committee that pulls the strings in England?
[01:46:49.113 --> 01:46:51.555]  Number three, I want to talk about the Conformity Act.
[01:46:51.875 --> 01:46:53.476]  Are you aware of the Conformity Act?
[01:46:54.117 --> 01:46:54.757]  It rings a bell.
[01:46:54.797 --> 01:46:55.218]  Fill me in.
[01:46:55.842 --> 01:47:02.427]  Well, it was like in the 1600s or 1700s when they had these Protestant denominations splitting off from the Anglican Church.
[01:47:03.067 --> 01:47:18.038]  And what they did is they passed the Tories, and you're sounding sometimes like a big Tory, they passed an act that nobody that would declare a religion other than the Anglican Episcopalian religion.
[01:47:18.178 --> 01:47:19.979]  You didn't have to be Catholic, you could have been
[01:47:20.529 --> 01:47:43.660]  Baptist, Methodist, whatever it was, could not hold public office, did not have certain civil rights, you've never brought this up, and they weren't allowed to go to the college or university and have higher education, and you've never, you've always said about the religious, you know, the viewpoints of the British people, and what I can say right now, Germany is the kind of place that has a German Pope
[01:47:44.475 --> 01:47:47.819]  And a Lutheran minister's daughter for chancellor.
[01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:50.402]  Sir, your whole call is unfair to me.
[01:47:52.429 --> 01:47:53.690]  You made statements that aren't true.
[01:47:54.911 --> 01:48:02.456]  I talked about how the British, and this is now mainstream history, funded Hitler, knowing he would tear everything up, setting up that whole scenario.
[01:48:03.756 --> 01:48:06.078]  On one hand, I get accused of being a Catholic apologist.
[01:48:06.118 --> 01:48:07.959]  On the other hand, I get accused of being a Catholicator.
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:16.885]  I'm non-sectarian because this is how they control us, getting us all to square off in our own little groups instead of fighting the New World Order.
[01:48:17.946 --> 01:48:20.948]  And I'm just a guy from, you know, Texas.
[01:48:21.873 --> 01:48:29.555]  And I'm here covering the news and the information and see almost every call, man, brings up ninnying in our own circles.
[01:48:29.615 --> 01:48:30.475]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:31.035 --> 01:48:31.175]  Okay?
[01:48:31.235 --> 01:48:33.396]  And I just, I mean, this is an illustration of it.
[01:48:34.396 --> 01:48:39.737]  I mean, most patriots, I'd say over half or a little over half, they just fight with other patriots all day long.
[01:48:39.777 --> 01:48:40.598]  That's what you do.
[01:48:41.498 --> 01:48:42.458]  And see, I don't do that.
[01:48:42.978 --> 01:48:49.780]  I'm like, hey, the government over and over again is saying they're about to have a terror attack and that we'll love them again and that soon we'll want to attack Iran and that
[01:48:51.013 --> 01:48:52.033]  There's going to be a big event.
[01:48:52.373 --> 01:48:56.355]  Oh my gosh, let's try to get the word out about government-sponsored terror so we can stop it.
[01:48:57.255 --> 01:48:58.215]  And then I hear another host.
[01:48:58.435 --> 01:49:00.056]  Oh, 9-11 truce going nowhere.
[01:49:00.436 --> 01:49:01.216]  It's not effective.
[01:49:01.356 --> 01:49:02.236]  What are you talking about?
[01:49:02.616 --> 01:49:04.037]  Everybody's talking about false flag.
[01:49:04.057 --> 01:49:05.497]  Everybody's talking about New World Order.
[01:49:05.997 --> 01:49:07.318]  Everybody's waking up to this.
[01:49:07.378 --> 01:49:08.678]  We're having huge effects.
[01:49:08.998 --> 01:49:15.260]  Ron Paul has raised more money than John McCain is surging, and they're starting to say he can win.
[01:49:18.641 --> 01:49:19.502]  That's another thing, too.
[01:49:19.782 --> 01:49:20.943]  People aren't prepared to win!
[01:49:20.963 --> 01:49:24.245]  I am prepared, not even in this round or the next.
[01:49:25.006 --> 01:49:26.126]  I'm prepared to win!
[01:49:29.209 --> 01:49:31.530]  We're also in this mentality of losers and victims.
[01:49:31.630 --> 01:49:33.692]  I want to get out of being victimized by the New World Order.
[01:49:34.112 --> 01:49:35.573]  I want to get into power.
[01:49:36.093 --> 01:49:37.695]  I want to restore the Republic.
[01:49:39.336 --> 01:49:40.116]  I'm prepared!
[01:49:40.136 --> 01:49:43.879]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:49:44.742 --> 01:49:45.683]  See, there you go again.
[01:49:46.083 --> 01:49:49.544]  We'll take another one, see what comes out of the grab bag next, after this quick break.
[01:49:50.745 --> 01:50:02.551]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.931 --> 01:50:10.535]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.269 --> 01:50:18.311]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.712 --> 01:50:30.135]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.435 --> 01:50:34.377]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.397 --> 01:50:36.357]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.678 --> 01:50:40.519]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.017 --> 01:50:59.239]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:59.379 --> 01:51:07.481]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.721 --> 01:51:14.783]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.963 --> 01:51:16.264]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:16.324 --> 01:51:22.229]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:27.513]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.613 --> 01:51:36.481]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.761 --> 01:51:40.063]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:51:42.145 --> 01:51:42.486]  We're good.
[01:51:53.917 --> 01:52:05.868]  JLS Research, the makers of the all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates that those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[01:52:06.008 --> 01:52:12.754]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[01:52:12.874 --> 01:52:20.221]  By using organic and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[01:52:20.581 --> 01:52:23.645]  As it responds, body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[01:52:23.945 --> 01:52:27.570]  First Responder is the first of its kind, comprised of only four organics.
[01:52:27.870 --> 01:52:31.274]  Grape seed skins, grape seed, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[01:52:31.535 --> 01:52:36.140]  It's so effective, you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[01:52:36.481 --> 01:52:37.662]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[01:52:39.364 --> 01:52:41.725]  Go online and order First Responder at no-bo.com.
[01:52:41.745 --> 01:52:43.486]  Visit no-bo.com or call JLS Research at 850-723-8599.
[01:52:43.506 --> 01:52:43.767]  That's 850-723-8599.
[01:52:43.787 --> 01:52:44.747]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:52:44.807 --> 01:52:46.768]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:07.438 --> 01:53:11.541]  The global elite openly are setting up a world government to kill at least 80% of us.
[01:53:13.743 --> 01:53:18.526]  And the new world order sets up websites, getting us all fighting with each other within our own movement.
[01:53:20.868 --> 01:53:30.335]  Instead of fighting against open borders, globalism, the United Nations, the main organs of their power, the Federal Reserve, everything Ron Paul is trying to get us out of.
[01:53:30.655 --> 01:53:31.916]  You remove those mechanisms,
[01:53:33.727 --> 01:53:35.608]  It doesn't matter who's in those secret councils.
[01:53:35.828 --> 01:53:37.870]  By the way, it's the representatives of every major group out there.
[01:53:38.230 --> 01:53:41.632]  Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, it doesn't matter.
[01:53:41.652 --> 01:53:42.512]  It's New World Order.
[01:53:43.313 --> 01:53:44.974]  That's the point I keep trying to hammer home.
[01:53:46.195 --> 01:53:48.556]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kyle in Iowa.
[01:53:48.576 --> 01:53:49.917]  Kyle, thanks for holding your ear on the air.
[01:53:50.978 --> 01:53:52.979]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:53:53.199 --> 01:53:54.700]  I'm going to switch gears a little bit here.
[01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:57.381]  I just want to throw out two quick things here.
[01:53:58.462 --> 01:53:59.323]  One thing people can do if
[01:54:00.333 --> 01:54:08.901]  Even if you're kind of scared to go out and do anything, and I did this and it worked, so I think other people can do it, is just put something about 9-11 was an inside job in a swap sheet.
[01:54:09.321 --> 01:54:19.330]  I put it under the free section, 9-11 was an inside job, watch the terrorist storm, da-da-da-da-da, on Google Video, Infowars.com, da-da-da-da-da, whatever.
[01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:27.377]  The next thing I wanted to throw out there was, and I would do this myself, I just don't have the knowledge base or the resources I think to do justice, but
[01:54:28.106 --> 01:54:45.534]  Kind of in the same vein, when we went over to Iraq, and it had the enemy cards, what if someone were to make and sell traders to the Republicans, you know, like David Rockefeller, King of Spades, CFR Trilateral?
[01:54:45.694 --> 01:54:52.797]  No, no, we've had that idea, I just never had the capital or personnel to make those cards, and somebody ought to do it.
[01:54:53.757 --> 01:54:55.318]  Yeah, I think, so I could be
[01:54:56.007 --> 01:55:00.755]  You know, I mean, that would help us really focus in on who the real enemy is.
[01:55:00.795 --> 01:55:03.820]  I think a lot of people still don't know who these people are.
[01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:04.441]  No, I agree.
[01:55:04.481 --> 01:55:07.747]  Well, the Patriot Movement was like you, and about half of us are.
[01:55:08.319 --> 01:55:08.599]  I think so.
[01:55:31.272 --> 01:55:33.733]  We need every able-bodied person in the info war.
[01:55:34.113 --> 01:55:37.113]  I don't care what color you are, where you're from, where you are in the world.
[01:55:37.593 --> 01:55:39.434]  This new world order is coming down on you.
[01:55:40.314 --> 01:55:47.095]  And all I can say is, I absolutely completely salute you, Kyle, for what you're doing in Iowa, and just keep it up.
[01:55:48.215 --> 01:55:49.095]  Well, thank you, thank you.
[01:55:49.196 --> 01:55:51.936]  And, gosh, I just forgot what I was going to say now.
[01:55:51.976 --> 01:55:53.016]  That's all right.
[01:55:53.056 --> 01:55:53.896]  No, go ahead, go ahead.
[01:55:57.236 --> 01:56:00.177]  I was just going to say, I think you need to stop.
[01:56:00.218 --> 01:56:01.018]  This is what I was going to say.
[01:56:01.038 --> 01:56:17.246]  I think people need to just stop squabbling, like you're saying, because they're sure as heck going to wish that when the cops come knocking on their door, the foreign troops or whatever come knocking on the door and they want to throw them out of the camp, they're going to be like, oh gosh, I wish I would have done more.
[01:56:17.566 --> 01:56:17.926]  Now what?
[01:56:19.007 --> 01:56:21.148]  It just blows my mind how
[01:56:22.113 --> 01:56:25.774]  Some people are just so, like, dull to the fact of what's going on.
[01:56:25.854 --> 01:56:26.394]  It's simple.
[01:56:26.454 --> 01:56:27.094]  Here's the analogy.
[01:56:27.114 --> 01:56:28.515]  You've got a room of 500 people.
[01:56:29.755 --> 01:56:31.315]  Uh, the dam's breaking down the street.
[01:56:31.476 --> 01:56:35.217]  If even 200 of them went and helped fix the dam, the town wouldn't flood.
[01:56:35.777 --> 01:56:40.418]  But there's an evil agent amongst them who starts a fight and starts an argument so that they argue.
[01:56:40.658 --> 01:56:45.279]  And then other people who aren't evil, who aren't part of the conspiracy, they all start arguing and infighting.
[01:56:45.499 --> 01:56:47.860]  And then nobody goes down the street to fix the dam and it breaks.
[01:56:48.852 --> 01:56:49.172]  You see?
[01:56:49.192 --> 01:56:51.633]  I mean, we gotta quit screwing around, folks.
[01:56:51.973 --> 01:56:53.074]  We gotta get serious.
[01:56:54.514 --> 01:56:59.116]  And I'm just so sick of emails asking me, why don't you respond to this?
[01:56:59.496 --> 01:57:00.016]  Why don't you?
[01:57:00.036 --> 01:57:03.937]  I have responded to all the baloney that's been made up about me and Ron Paul and others.
[01:57:04.618 --> 01:57:07.078]  And it's always respond again, again, again, again, again.
[01:57:07.479 --> 01:57:08.819]  That's the thing about the internet.
[01:57:08.839 --> 01:57:09.659]  That's the thing about the web.
[01:57:09.679 --> 01:57:10.820]  You just don't respond to it.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:14.861]  People that care are gonna go research it for themselves and find out it's not true.
[01:57:15.541 --> 01:57:16.842]  Ron Paul is not the CFR.
[01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:22.201]  Ron Paul is not working for the Pope.
[01:57:22.361 --> 01:57:28.163]  Ron Paul is not wanting to kill the internet.
[01:57:28.523 --> 01:57:29.904]  It's totally made up.
[01:57:30.264 --> 01:57:31.124]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:34.305 --> 01:57:38.546]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.579 --> 01:57:51.240]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.881 --> 01:57:52.962]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.643 --> 01:57:54.765]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.425 --> 01:57:56.226]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.987 --> 01:57:58.009]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.549 --> 01:58:02.334]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.735 --> 01:58:06.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.762 --> 01:58:08.742]  Hey, how you doing Alex today?
[01:58:08.762 --> 01:58:10.423]  Alex, I've wanted to talk to you for a long time, man.
[01:58:10.443 --> 01:58:10.863]  I'm a fan of yours.
[01:58:10.904 --> 01:58:14.265]  I know God used you to kind of open my eyes to what's been going on in the world.
[01:58:38.004 --> 01:58:41.466]  And, uh, I kind of listen to you after you come home from being with your kids.
[01:58:41.907 --> 01:58:43.488]  You know, I've got two daughters of my own.
[01:58:44.508 --> 01:58:47.991]  And, uh, man, I just want to breathe some hope into you.
[01:58:49.051 --> 01:58:52.794]  And, uh, I had a passage of scripture that I'd like to read to you if that's alright.
[01:58:54.515 --> 01:58:54.975]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:58:55.776 --> 01:58:56.056]  Okay.
[01:58:56.436 --> 01:58:59.939]  This isn't mainstream media where you gotta ask permission to say what you want.
[01:59:00.179 --> 01:59:00.539]  Go ahead.
[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:02.720]  It's in Psalm 37.
[01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:06.623]  It says, Threaten not thyself because of evildoers.
[01:59:07.642 --> 01:59:12.687]  Neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity, for they shall soon be cut down like the grass.
[01:59:14.349 --> 01:59:16.972]  Wither as green herb, trust in the Lord and do good.
[01:59:16.992 --> 01:59:20.835]  Still shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.
[01:59:21.156 --> 01:59:25.120]  Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he shall give you the desires of your heart.
[01:59:26.101 --> 01:59:30.105]  Submit thy ways unto the Lord, trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass.
[01:59:31.352 --> 01:59:36.594]  Well, I want to be clear that I do trust and I have been given the desires of my heart.
[01:59:36.774 --> 01:59:37.794]  I am so blessed.
[01:59:38.714 --> 01:59:39.715]  I am so honored.
[01:59:40.835 --> 01:59:43.836]  Again, it's just I'm not good at this, okay?
[01:59:43.956 --> 01:59:45.676]  I am a mean, angry person.
[01:59:46.096 --> 01:59:47.817]  I can't believe all the criminals around me.
[01:59:48.117 --> 01:59:50.678]  I frankly want to assault them and I'm just mad.
[01:59:50.878 --> 01:59:51.298]  That's all.
[01:59:52.338 --> 01:59:53.218]  Alex, I am too.
[01:59:53.699 --> 01:59:58.100]  And the only thing that is keeping me on focus is the word because, you know, this
[01:59:58.951 --> 02:00:02.154]  You know, we have it written in Revelations that there will be a one world government.
[02:00:02.714 --> 02:00:06.037]  And I'm not with the people that want to lay down, and I'm not with what the church says.
[02:00:06.057 --> 02:00:07.078]  No, no, I believe the Bible.
[02:00:07.138 --> 02:00:10.580]  My whole point is that it doesn't matter what's coming, I'm going to fight it head up.
[02:00:11.681 --> 02:00:12.682]  Yeah, I'm with you there, man.
[02:00:12.942 --> 02:00:18.807]  But, you know, I really don't have any other way to, uh, to, I guess, converse with you.
[02:00:18.827 --> 02:00:20.468]  You know, because I've been praying for you, man.
[02:00:20.569 --> 02:00:24.071]  I listen to you, how frustrated you get sometimes, like we all do.
[02:00:24.432 --> 02:00:28.375]  And you go for one day to be with your kids, and you come back on the show, man, and you're at peace.
[02:00:29.441 --> 02:00:31.384]  I mean, your voice is different.
[02:00:31.824 --> 02:00:33.827]  And I just want you to know that I'm praying for you.
[02:00:33.847 --> 02:00:38.112]  I've still got some more of this verse, but I really feel like Psalm 37 is for you.
[02:00:43.486 --> 02:00:44.286]  Listen, I will tell you.
[02:00:44.306 --> 02:00:46.166]  I'll take off one or two days and then I do.
[02:00:46.306 --> 02:00:46.927]  I'm at peace.
[02:00:47.387 --> 02:00:54.328]  People that know me personally, I'll sit there for an hour around a coffee table where people are drinking coffee and I won't say a word.
[02:00:54.448 --> 02:00:58.909]  I'm the type of person, I get up here and this is who I am when I'm fighting them.
[02:00:59.190 --> 02:01:01.050]  I'm not like this in person.
[02:01:01.690 --> 02:01:06.131]  I'm somebody who likes to dig around in the yard and plant things.
[02:01:06.231 --> 02:01:08.172]  I'm in the mode to go after these people.
[02:01:08.512 --> 02:01:09.112]  But go ahead.
[02:01:14.518 --> 02:01:15.399]  It shakes me up.
[02:01:15.419 --> 02:01:22.364]  I started looking at the Federal Reserve and then God brought me onto listening to your show.
[02:01:22.384 --> 02:01:26.748]  I just want you to know that I am praying for you specifically.
[02:01:26.788 --> 02:01:28.069]  I know God is using you.
[02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:30.751]  I know you are a Christian.
[02:01:31.192 --> 02:01:33.373]  I see God's hand on you when you're praying for people.
[02:01:34.474 --> 02:01:38.237]  I just think iron sharpens iron and sometimes you need to have somebody
[02:01:40.037 --> 02:01:43.799]  You need to know that people are praying for you, and lifting you up before the Lord.
[02:01:43.979 --> 02:01:44.459]  Let me just say this.
[02:01:44.479 --> 02:01:45.220]  You guys were attacked.
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:46.400]  Your whole family was attacked.
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:47.961]  Let me just say this.
[02:01:48.081 --> 02:01:52.423]  I couldn't do what I do without the prayer, and I can feel your prayers.
[02:01:54.204 --> 02:01:58.526]  Well, you know, this New World Order is the spirit of Antichrist.
[02:01:59.626 --> 02:02:06.510]  And it is working, but you know, the promises in the Bible, they are not going to overtake us.
[02:02:06.570 --> 02:02:07.490]  They will not win.
[02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.850]  Psalms 37 is full.
[02:02:10.795 --> 02:02:14.096]  Of, you know, God's blessing upon his people.
[02:02:15.437 --> 02:02:25.981]  Uh, yeah, I guess I really don't have time to read you, you know, you know, ten more verses, but it specifically speaks about what's going on right now.
[02:02:26.001 --> 02:02:26.701]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:02:26.801 --> 02:02:30.022]  Quickly, let me get back and read your verses, and then I'm going to get to everybody else.
[02:02:30.042 --> 02:02:33.183]  I don't have everybody else's time, but we all got all these great callers.
[02:02:34.144 --> 02:02:36.044]  Look, we're not supposed to act normal here and calm.
[02:02:36.525 --> 02:02:37.405]  This is out of control.
[02:02:38.323 --> 02:02:38.603]  Okay?
[02:02:39.103 --> 02:02:40.304]  That's what people listen to this show, though.
[02:02:40.364 --> 02:02:40.904]  It's real.
[02:02:41.625 --> 02:02:42.685]  I wear my heart on my sleeve.
[02:02:42.725 --> 02:02:43.325]  This is real.
[02:02:46.467 --> 02:02:49.909]  It's here.
[02:02:50.109 --> 02:02:54.891]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:55.251 --> 02:03:02.875]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:03.590 --> 02:03:10.632]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:11.033 --> 02:03:22.456]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.776 --> 02:03:26.258]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.738 --> 02:03:28.698]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.999 --> 02:03:32.840]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:46.251 --> 02:04:48.172]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[02:04:48.633 --> 02:04:52.094]  Look, up there in the sky, it's Non-X-Man.
[02:04:52.495 --> 02:04:53.655]  He's in a dive.
[02:04:53.935 --> 02:04:55.937]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[02:04:56.237 --> 02:04:56.957]  Let's go look.
[02:04:59.211 --> 02:05:02.392]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X-Nail Gel.
[02:05:02.813 --> 02:05:04.153]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[02:05:04.373 --> 02:05:04.833]  Take them out.
[02:05:05.434 --> 02:05:06.154]  Let's see.
[02:05:08.595 --> 02:05:10.716]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[02:05:11.076 --> 02:05:11.536]  Don't worry.
[02:05:11.996 --> 02:05:13.497]  Now there's Non-X-Nail Gel.
[02:05:14.137 --> 02:05:18.539]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[02:05:19.079 --> 02:05:21.140]  Oh, I will Non-X-Man.
[02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:23.961]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[02:05:26.102 --> 02:05:28.764]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[02:05:29.224 --> 02:05:32.686]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[02:05:33.226 --> 02:05:44.432]  It's in the foot care aisle at Super Setters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[02:05:44.452 --> 02:05:51.936]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:54.503 --> 02:05:56.204]  Okay, we got a caller, Caleb, from Texas.
[02:05:56.244 --> 02:05:58.604]  We're going to read a couple more passages.
[02:05:58.985 --> 02:06:06.787]  We're going to go to Larry, Tommy, Johnny, Wayne, Mario, John, and others.
[02:06:07.408 --> 02:06:08.888]  Okay, go ahead and finish up, Caleb.
[02:06:09.768 --> 02:06:10.168]  Okay, sir.
[02:06:10.929 --> 02:06:12.829]  Rest in the Lord, wait patiently for Him.
[02:06:12.929 --> 02:06:16.070]  Fret not thyself because of Him who prospers in His way.
[02:06:16.151 --> 02:06:18.631]  Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
[02:06:19.352 --> 02:06:21.032]  Cease from anger and forsake wrath.
[02:06:21.212 --> 02:06:23.253]  Fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.
[02:06:23.849 --> 02:06:28.171]  I was going to let you read all this, but your cell phone or whatever it is is breaking up bad.
[02:06:49.770 --> 02:06:50.971]  I'm sorry.
[02:06:51.251 --> 02:06:54.793]  Just tell folks the particular subsection and chapter so they can go read it.
[02:06:55.653 --> 02:07:01.016]  It's Psalms 37 and just the whole thing.
[02:07:01.116 --> 02:07:04.037]  And Alex, I want you to know that I am praying for you every day.
[02:07:04.258 --> 02:07:06.299]  I hear you and I appreciate it and you're awesome.
[02:07:06.839 --> 02:07:07.679]  Take care my friend.
[02:07:07.699 --> 02:07:09.020]  There goes Caleb from Texas.
[02:07:10.441 --> 02:07:16.504]  But there's also that passage about a time to reap, a time to sow, a time to love, a time to fight, a time to die, a time to
[02:07:17.345 --> 02:07:30.708]  And so, you know, there are hundreds of examples in the Bible of an enemy comes in to kill you, rise up and kill them, defend your family, stand up, fight back, don't go along with.
[02:07:31.388 --> 02:07:34.409]  There is a time to be meek, and there's times when I am meek.
[02:07:35.229 --> 02:07:36.909]  And there's a time to not be meek, folks.
[02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:38.289]  That's my point.
[02:07:38.309 --> 02:07:39.410]  You have to have discernment.
[02:07:40.730 --> 02:07:43.130]  And I don't even claim to have that good a discernment, but I guess I do.
[02:07:43.190 --> 02:07:46.071]  I mean, how could you not know just Ron Paul's good, you know?
[02:07:46.849 --> 02:07:48.050]  But again, we have to have this debate.
[02:07:48.630 --> 02:07:49.111]  That's fine.
[02:07:50.451 --> 02:07:51.692]  I had one guy call me a few months ago.
[02:07:51.712 --> 02:07:52.333]  I blew up at him.
[02:07:52.353 --> 02:07:55.075]  He said, you know, Ron Paul's just too good to be true.
[02:07:58.577 --> 02:08:02.499]  Well, you have to go look at his history and what he's done.
[02:08:02.519 --> 02:08:03.980]  The fruits he's borne.
[02:08:06.382 --> 02:08:07.563]  I mean, how do you judge a tree?
[02:08:07.643 --> 02:08:08.363]  By its fruits.
[02:08:08.403 --> 02:08:10.325]  That's a great parable, even if you're not a Christian.
[02:08:10.805 --> 02:08:12.066]  I mean, that makes a lot of sense.
[02:08:12.865 --> 02:08:15.246]  Ron Paul has created amazing fruit.
[02:08:16.126 --> 02:08:16.686]  Good fruit.
[02:08:17.606 --> 02:08:18.766]  He stood up against evil.
[02:08:19.767 --> 02:08:20.947]  He deserves our support.
[02:08:23.027 --> 02:08:26.948]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:30.229]  Let's talk to Larry in Ohio.
[02:08:30.269 --> 02:08:30.829]  Go ahead, Larry.
[02:08:31.669 --> 02:08:32.670]  Hey, how you doing today, Alex?
[02:08:32.930 --> 02:08:33.290]  Good, sir.
[02:08:34.030 --> 02:08:35.110]  Hey, I wanted to talk to you.
[02:08:35.150 --> 02:08:38.751]  You were talking about autism and the vaccinations yesterday.
[02:08:39.383 --> 02:08:41.005]  I've got a 9-year-old autistic son.
[02:08:41.025 --> 02:08:42.647]  He was diagnosed when he was 3 years old.
[02:08:43.147 --> 02:08:47.372]  And I deal a lot with these, with a lot of families, a lot of other people who deal with the same problem.
[02:08:47.412 --> 02:08:49.515]  And all of them, what you're saying, you're right on track.
[02:08:50.176 --> 02:08:55.562]  All of these people, whenever they get the, typically the MMR shot, their kids were autistic a month later.
[02:08:55.582 --> 02:08:59.667]  They look at the videotapes before, their kids were fantastic.
[02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:02.082]  And then it's just like you say, the light goes out.
[02:09:02.282 --> 02:09:04.023]  It's like the twinkle's gone out of their eye.
[02:09:04.324 --> 02:09:11.770]  Listen, I've been at the Texas coast in a hot tub at a hotel, and the woman's got an autistic child, and I say, let me guess, at 18 months, that happened.
[02:09:12.110 --> 02:09:14.472]  Yeah, the day he took the shots.
[02:09:15.033 --> 02:09:20.637]  But I'm not sure it's the shots, and then they give me the line about, because it's only boys, it would do it to girls.
[02:09:20.777 --> 02:09:26.923]  No, the boys don't have the gene, or the gene's not dominant, to let it pass the blood-brain barrier.
[02:09:26.963 --> 02:09:27.203]  Go ahead.
[02:09:27.865 --> 02:09:32.407]  If you research what mercury poisoning does to you, it's the same thing.
[02:09:32.487 --> 02:09:33.527]  Autism, exactly.
[02:09:34.328 --> 02:09:39.950]  And do the hospitals and doctors when the child goes autistic tell you how to detox them quick and reverse most of it?
[02:09:40.170 --> 02:09:40.951]  And maybe save them?
[02:09:41.411 --> 02:09:42.571]  No, they don't do that.
[02:09:42.591 --> 02:09:43.532]  No, they don't.
[02:09:43.592 --> 02:09:45.613]  They don't know what causes it.
[02:09:45.653 --> 02:09:50.015]  The nurses, the doctors, 95% of them do not vaccinate their own children.
[02:09:50.415 --> 02:09:53.376]  You try to talk to these medical professionals, as they call them,
[02:09:53.835 --> 02:09:57.880]  About how many times they have to rush a kid to the emergency room because of the shots.
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:00.143]  They won't even, they tell you, they can't talk about it.
[02:10:00.163 --> 02:10:03.086]  And by the way, notice like six, seven years ago, the feds are experts.
[02:10:03.126 --> 02:10:05.909]  They'll create a crisis and then they come up with a solution.
[02:10:05.929 --> 02:10:11.676]  Remember all the cop cars suddenly had bumper stickers and there were billboards saying, don't shake a baby, don't beat a baby.
[02:10:12.037 --> 02:10:13.779]  And when the 18 month old sometimes
[02:10:14.577 --> 02:10:18.598]  Starts having convulsions in the hospital or at the clinic, then they can't grab them.
[02:10:18.898 --> 02:10:26.300]  But then they CPS the people's child because that night, they have a convulsion and then they just come arrest the parents saying they shook them!
[02:10:28.061 --> 02:10:30.682]  Because they can also do MRIs and show brain inflammation.
[02:10:30.742 --> 02:10:31.282]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:10:32.051 --> 02:10:33.392]  Almost every time, that's what happens.
[02:10:33.432 --> 02:10:38.014]  Whenever the kid has a violent reaction immediately, they immediately call CPS.
[02:10:38.034 --> 02:10:39.694]  Not a pure evil scum!
[02:10:40.035 --> 02:10:43.396]  It's not enough that they brain damage the children with extreme pleasure!
[02:10:43.916 --> 02:10:45.297]  It's them they've got to take them!
[02:10:46.057 --> 02:10:47.178]  I'm just sick of it!
[02:10:47.758 --> 02:10:48.458]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:10:48.518 --> 02:10:50.799]  After the whole thing goes on, it gets even worse.
[02:10:50.839 --> 02:10:54.541]  I mean, the people end up... I mean, it could basically cost you around $50,000-$60,000 to work with a child.
[02:10:56.877 --> 02:10:58.358]  They get them to where they're vaccinated.
[02:10:58.418 --> 02:11:01.499]  And the very same medical system that sucks up all the cash!
[02:11:02.059 --> 02:11:03.959]  I mean, folks, it's normal to get mad, by the way.
[02:11:04.319 --> 02:11:13.242]  Brain damaging and hurting children in a giant eugenics program is wrong, and I've had enough of our little boys, millions of them, having this done to them by these murderers!
[02:11:14.003 --> 02:11:20.705]  And all these families that I deal with, their kids are in good programs and such, none of them vaccinate their younger children.
[02:11:21.474 --> 02:11:22.575]  And it's an absolute hassle.
[02:11:22.615 --> 02:11:26.799]  You have to go with a religious objector status in order to get around it in the school systems.
[02:11:27.220 --> 02:11:27.680]  I hear you.
[02:11:28.401 --> 02:11:28.781]  I hear you.
[02:11:28.981 --> 02:11:32.224]  I mean, just briefly, because you work with these families.
[02:11:32.304 --> 02:11:33.185]  It happened to your child.
[02:11:34.667 --> 02:11:40.052]  I mean, so they now are coming out of denial, though, because they're noticing, wait, the child was fine and they took the shot.
[02:11:41.576 --> 02:11:43.837]  And the reason it's 18 months is that's when it builds up.
[02:11:43.857 --> 02:11:44.197]  Go ahead.
[02:11:44.738 --> 02:11:47.139]  I'm going to put the program on these parents.
[02:11:47.159 --> 02:11:48.459]  I mean, they're hard-working parents.
[02:11:48.639 --> 02:11:50.680]  There's probably the majority of them.
[02:11:51.001 --> 02:12:01.025]  They put them in the school system, which does absolutely nothing because, like in the case of my child, they get $72,000 a year, the school system does, for having an autistic child.
[02:12:01.366 --> 02:12:04.747]  As soon as he's deemed what they call typical, the money goes away.
[02:12:04.907 --> 02:12:09.990]  And by the way, by the way, the average child nationwide is only eight grand.
[02:12:11.107 --> 02:12:13.669]  And you're correct, 70 plus thousand on average.
[02:12:13.689 --> 02:12:14.790]  Some states it's above 100.
[02:12:15.110 --> 02:12:17.852]  Some, like Texas, is only getting like 45 for an autistic child.
[02:12:18.352 --> 02:12:25.057]  Pure money, and they literally pay the teacher 35, 40 grand, put them in portable buildings outside.
[02:12:25.337 --> 02:12:26.838]  Now their portable buildings are everywhere.
[02:12:26.858 --> 02:12:30.901]  I mean, you may have a school of 500 kids and 30, 40 of them are autistic.
[02:12:31.261 --> 02:12:33.422]  I mean, never existed before and they warehouse them.
[02:12:33.642 --> 02:12:41.565]  Can you imagine the cash cow having each portable with twelve autistic children in it, three or four portables, each teacher only getting thirty-something grand?
[02:12:41.585 --> 02:12:43.525]  Can you imagine the money they're making?
[02:12:44.206 --> 02:12:46.467]  And the programs in the public school are an absolute joke.
[02:12:46.487 --> 02:12:47.787]  They do nothing for these kids.
[02:12:47.827 --> 02:12:58.591]  Well, as you said, the money goes away and they come out of it, so then they put them on drugs, then they start claiming they're a discipline problem, then they try to get you to institutionalize them where the real cash is made.
[02:12:59.625 --> 02:13:03.347]  Yeah, there was one teacher, she actually asked me, does your child really need to learn how to talk?
[02:13:05.208 --> 02:13:05.768]  It's insane.
[02:13:06.649 --> 02:13:15.653]  Well, yeah, they're usually drug addict babies themselves, had scum parents, and there are a lot of loving people in these things, but there's also a lot of scum.
[02:13:17.554 --> 02:13:23.017]  But my kids are in a program now with people, I mean, they do a lot of work, they don't depend on the system to help their kids.
[02:13:23.715 --> 02:13:33.361]  And you talk to them in private, they'll tell you that, yeah, they think, you know, it happened all around the Mercury, but they won't talk about it to other people because they're afraid of losing funding that they get from the state.
[02:13:33.721 --> 02:13:39.025]  Because you can't possibly work as much as you need to work on this program and make enough money to pay for it.
[02:13:39.045 --> 02:13:39.765]  Like I said, $50,000 to $60,000 a year.
[02:13:43.502 --> 02:13:44.803]  It's pure evil, my friend.
[02:13:45.063 --> 02:13:46.204]  Absolute pure evil.
[02:13:46.244 --> 02:13:47.105]  I appreciate your call.
[02:13:47.125 --> 02:13:48.766]  I was about to go to Mario, but he just hung up.
[02:13:49.107 --> 02:13:50.688]  Mario, I wanted to go to you from California.
[02:13:50.708 --> 02:13:54.031]  If you can get back in, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[02:13:54.311 --> 02:13:57.674]  We're about to go to Johnny Wayne.
[02:13:58.434 --> 02:14:05.580]  But before I do that, I mean, I involuntarily start yelling and screaming.
[02:14:08.175 --> 02:14:13.317]  Here on air because I don't like having to focus on this because I have to come in here like 10, 15, sometimes 20 hours a day.
[02:14:13.377 --> 02:14:18.740]  Last time I worked 17 hours and when I worked that much and I couldn't go to sleep, rolled around for 3 hours.
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:20.781]  I used to always sleep great.
[02:14:20.821 --> 02:14:27.003]  Now I overwork and when you overwork you can't sleep so I'm in, I've had about 3 hours sleep probably and I'm just in a bad mood.
[02:14:27.143 --> 02:14:27.544]  It's true.
[02:14:28.624 --> 02:14:34.267]  But to make a long story short, I mean I get up here on air and I know what he's going to say next because I've seen it everywhere.
[02:14:34.587 --> 02:14:35.227]  It's documented.
[02:14:36.391 --> 02:14:56.583]  I mean, not only do they shoot your kid up full of stuff that they know attacks the brain viciously, then they send those slack-jawed punks to take your child or to harass the living daylights out of you and the court system sucks a bunch out of you and you gotta go take classes and all this because they brain damage your child and you comply with these eugenicists.
[02:14:57.577 --> 02:15:00.279]  And by the way, I'm studying all this eugenics right now for Endgame.
[02:15:00.299 --> 02:15:01.960]  I mean, we're at the end of the film here.
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:02.820]  Deep research.
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:05.122]  It's what to leave in, what to leave out is the problem.
[02:15:05.142 --> 02:15:07.043]  I don't want to make the film ten hours long.
[02:15:08.144 --> 02:15:09.604]  But I want to put on the case here.
[02:15:09.624 --> 02:15:10.805]  I mean, that's how much evidence we've got.
[02:15:10.845 --> 02:15:12.226]  I want to put all this stuff on for you.
[02:15:12.286 --> 02:15:13.887]  I mean, this is red-handed, man.
[02:15:14.808 --> 02:15:18.650]  This is Margaret Sanger saying, we don't want the blacks to figure out we're exterminating them.
[02:15:19.050 --> 02:15:21.512]  So we've got our black leaders out there as our fronts.
[02:15:22.196 --> 02:15:25.058]  Then I learned the black leaders agreed with her and didn't like their own people.
[02:15:25.538 --> 02:15:27.420]  I mean, man, this is hardcore!
[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:30.522]  And then I find out they were doing it to the whites, mainly.
[02:15:31.683 --> 02:15:35.105]  And that they were having trouble with the blacks because they didn't trust them, thank God.
[02:15:35.125 --> 02:15:39.168]  But the gullible whites thought it was really a special treat they were getting.
[02:15:39.188 --> 02:15:43.091]  Because, you know, they're members of the elite, so it's so easy to sell them on anything.
[02:15:43.691 --> 02:15:45.853]  Same giggly yuppies we had the day we had back then.
[02:15:45.873 --> 02:15:48.875]  And then I talk about how they founded all the major movements.
[02:15:50.305 --> 02:16:00.687]  I mean, we're talking sociology, we're talking psychology, we're talking demographics, biometrics, modern law enforcement, social working was founded on it.
[02:16:00.988 --> 02:16:07.369]  I mean, folks, I mean literally 90% of the government agencies, you hear the names of, human resources and all this, it's all eugenics.
[02:16:07.469 --> 02:16:13.290]  They literally, I said they run everything, they run the entire global government codified system.
[02:16:14.471 --> 02:16:15.431]  They run it all.
[02:16:16.989 --> 02:16:19.792]  I mean, you can't trust ANYTHING this government does.
[02:16:19.832 --> 02:16:21.755]  You can't trust ANYTHING they say.
[02:16:22.235 --> 02:16:28.562]  You can't... I mean... You got... And then they got special psychological warfare ops on who they hire.
[02:16:28.602 --> 02:16:31.586]  Like, most of the social workers were abused as children.
[02:16:32.541 --> 02:16:32.842]  I think so.
[02:16:49.558 --> 02:16:51.299]  Uh, and you find out it's all eugenics.
[02:16:51.919 --> 02:16:52.960]  I mean, what are they called?
[02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:59.944]  You know, I told you I have that UT textbook where they call the family a disease that must be eradicated that's currently being used for social workers.
[02:17:00.265 --> 02:17:05.528]  I found where all that stuff came from, I mean, a hundred years ago, 130 years ago, 60, 70 years ago.
[02:17:05.608 --> 02:17:11.652]  I've got piles of books and letters and university documents and LexisNexis searches and just
[02:17:12.072 --> 02:17:13.233]  Literally piles of it.
[02:17:13.253 --> 02:17:19.476]  I mean like three foot tall piles of books and documents just how they're going to slaughter us and kill us and do all this to us.
[02:17:19.496 --> 02:17:24.479]  Then they inject your children with something that they know attacks their brain.
[02:17:24.519 --> 02:17:25.460]  It's by design.
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:30.222]  And then the cop stalls start wondering, why are all these kids suddenly collapsing?
[02:17:30.242 --> 02:17:32.243]  And they go, that's because they shook them.
[02:17:33.144 --> 02:17:34.445]  They'd beaten that toddler.
[02:17:34.785 --> 02:17:36.566]  Get over there and take them.
[02:17:36.666 --> 02:17:40.588]  And the well-meaning cop, rode to hell, paid with good intentions, goes over and does it.
[02:17:41.534 --> 02:17:45.135]  I mean, it's just unbelievable!
[02:17:46.276 --> 02:17:50.877]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.

[02:18:37.884 --> 02:18:39.429]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:46.156 --> 02:18:50.057]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:18:50.277 --> 02:19:02.540]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:19:02.980 --> 02:19:03.380]  The U.S.
[02:19:03.421 --> 02:19:09.002]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:19:09.402 --> 02:19:11.603]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:19:13.483 --> 02:19:14.525]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:19:14.565 --> 02:19:17.428]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:19:17.568 --> 02:19:23.555]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:19:23.995 --> 02:19:27.339]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[02:19:41.409 --> 02:19:41.789]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:41.969 --> 02:19:50.891]  Hello, I'm Dr. Bill Diegels, a Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis After Alex Jones 2-4 Monday to Friday.
[02:19:51.231 --> 02:19:59.473]  Develop the first line of defense kit to block pathogenic infective organisms to give you day-to-day protection as well as infection protection against biological and chemical weapons.
[02:19:59.553 --> 02:20:00.913]  Defense tabs block viruses
[02:20:00.913 --> 02:20:01.513]  We're good to go!
[02:20:25.538 --> 02:20:25.778]  I think so.
[02:20:46.145 --> 02:20:48.886]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:49.146 --> 02:20:55.748]  Did you know that there is a concentration camp program that was designed during the Ronald Reagan administration called Rex 84?
[02:20:56.468 --> 02:21:01.730]  This program is designed to imprison anyone whom the federal government deems an enemy of the state.
[02:21:02.450 --> 02:21:14.194]  A judge in Houston, Texas declared that the plaintiff had proven that there was such a program that existed, but no one had been harmed or imprisoned by it, so he declared it unconstitutional and dismissed the case.

[02:21:57.497 --> 02:21:58.438]  It's always interesting.
[02:21:58.978 --> 02:22:03.841]  Johnny Wayne with 9-11 Truth has called in.
[02:22:04.521 --> 02:22:05.222]  What's going on?
[02:22:06.142 --> 02:22:06.923]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:22:06.943 --> 02:22:09.444]  This is actually Johnny Wave.
[02:22:09.905 --> 02:22:10.745]  Johnny Wave.
[02:22:10.845 --> 02:22:12.446]  OK, I thought it said Wayne.
[02:22:12.466 --> 02:22:13.407]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:22:13.427 --> 02:22:13.967]  I'm fine, sir.
[02:22:14.447 --> 02:22:19.310]  I just want to thank you personally, sir, because you opened my eyes to this big mess that we have going on here.
[02:22:19.370 --> 02:22:23.893]  And I met your friend Ed Asner this last Sunday at an event with David Ray Griffin.
[02:22:24.742 --> 02:22:32.585]  And he motivated me to call you to get your listeners on top of 911TruthTruthAction.org that we have going on out here.
[02:22:33.146 --> 02:22:35.207]  Go ahead.
[02:22:37.107 --> 02:22:38.008]  Is this phone coming out?
[02:22:42.069 --> 02:22:44.631]  If he can get back on, we'll have him on.
[02:22:46.051 --> 02:22:50.013]  Okay, let's go ahead now and take another call here.
[02:22:51.402 --> 02:22:57.425]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Josh in New York.
[02:22:57.465 --> 02:22:58.465]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:22:58.485 --> 02:23:00.466]  Hello?
[02:23:00.786 --> 02:23:01.426]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:23:01.666 --> 02:23:02.387]  Oh, this is John.
[02:23:03.247 --> 02:23:04.788]  Okay, let's just get you on air.
[02:23:04.868 --> 02:23:15.872]  Alright, I've noticed that they've started around here on the news giving a lot of propaganda for some kind of medication that cures your addiction to smoking cigarettes.
[02:23:17.449 --> 02:23:19.690]  If it's a vaccination, it is mooey bad.
[02:23:20.170 --> 02:23:21.850]  No, it's a pill, actually.
[02:23:23.490 --> 02:23:30.192]  Yeah, there's a bunch of those, and some of them, I've tried to look into them a little bit, but... I was just wondering how they work, and that's my call.
[02:23:30.252 --> 02:23:30.852]  Thanks for your time.
[02:23:31.012 --> 02:23:31.532]  Thank you, sir.
[02:23:31.552 --> 02:23:33.772]  I appreciate you holding, John, to ask that question.
[02:23:33.832 --> 02:23:34.232]  I don't know.
[02:23:34.252 --> 02:23:35.133]  I don't know the particular pill.
[02:23:35.573 --> 02:23:36.013]  Do you know?
[02:23:36.033 --> 02:23:38.033]  No, I never heard of it.
[02:23:38.053 --> 02:23:39.813]  I was just like, oh, wow, they have a pill of these.
[02:23:39.853 --> 02:23:42.414]  I heard of the vaccine, but I never heard of a pill form of this.
[02:23:42.955 --> 02:23:44.656]  Well, I've struggled with tobacco.
[02:23:44.736 --> 02:23:47.338]  People say once you get off of it, a lot of people don't want it anymore.
[02:23:47.458 --> 02:23:48.259]  I always wanted it.
[02:23:48.299 --> 02:23:49.480]  I was wanting it last night.
[02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:51.681]  Frankly, I like to smoke a pipe.
[02:23:51.721 --> 02:23:53.022]  I was wanting a bowl of tobacco.
[02:23:53.062 --> 02:23:55.544]  Like, nobody's business at about two in the morning working.
[02:23:56.665 --> 02:23:58.106]  But it gives you cancer.
[02:23:58.146 --> 02:23:58.806]  It's really bad.
[02:23:58.826 --> 02:24:01.388]  And the patches don't work for me.
[02:24:01.448 --> 02:24:03.950]  There's one way to do it, and that's cold turkey.
[02:24:04.804 --> 02:24:05.685]  But you better look out.
[02:24:05.745 --> 02:24:07.087]  I've quit smoking like ten times.
[02:24:07.447 --> 02:24:09.610]  I've quit for two years, four years, a month.
[02:24:10.131 --> 02:24:12.093]  I haven't been smoking now for about four months again.
[02:24:12.654 --> 02:24:15.537]  People always come up to me on the street and they go, I thought you don't smoke!
[02:24:17.219 --> 02:24:18.681]  No, I go on and off the stuff.
[02:24:18.721 --> 02:24:20.824]  I mean, I've got a serious problem with it.
[02:24:21.364 --> 02:24:23.227]  Thank God I never got into any other drugs.
[02:24:24.762 --> 02:24:25.882]  I like cigarettes, man.
[02:24:25.902 --> 02:24:26.683]  I like tobacco.
[02:24:26.703 --> 02:24:27.683]  I like chewing tobacco.
[02:24:28.303 --> 02:24:29.003]  I like it all.
[02:24:29.123 --> 02:24:36.405]  And I know they've got vaccines that attack the brain and create plaques, very dangerous, that will, quote, cure you of nicotine addiction.
[02:24:36.965 --> 02:24:39.806]  But I wouldn't take that for anything.
[02:24:39.846 --> 02:24:42.887]  And I know they've got several different pills, prescription pills now.
[02:24:43.407 --> 02:24:46.027]  And I just don't know if they're safe because I haven't studied them.
[02:24:48.288 --> 02:24:49.348]  So I hope that can answer your question.
[02:24:49.388 --> 02:24:50.088]  I'm not a physician.
[02:24:51.309 --> 02:24:52.589]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[02:24:54.162 --> 02:24:55.222]  Kevin in Boston.
[02:24:55.262 --> 02:24:56.183]  You're on the air, Kevin.
[02:24:56.923 --> 02:24:58.263]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[02:24:58.283 --> 02:25:03.945]  You know, I'm a Boston-Irish Catholic, lifelong proud Kennedy Liberal Democrat.
[02:25:04.305 --> 02:25:07.286]  But thanks to you and others, I've been awoken.
[02:25:08.007 --> 02:25:17.610]  You know, I'd give the shirt off my back to help the next guy, but we see the Democrats haven't been helping anybody, and I've woken up, and I'm a Ron Paul Republican 100% right now.
[02:25:20.370 --> 02:25:21.371]  You have a huge audience.
[02:25:22.270 --> 02:25:33.179]  Just 200,000 people gave $5 after they finished listening to your show and they can go right on the web and do it by credit card at ronpaul2008.com
[02:25:35.410 --> 02:25:38.433]  And that would be a million dollars, and we'd keep the momentum going.
[02:25:38.613 --> 02:25:40.314]  Oh, I want to give our audience credit.
[02:25:40.655 --> 02:25:48.361]  Ron Paul said on air that more than half the support he's gotten has been from this audience, and I asked him off-air what percentage financial.
[02:25:48.381 --> 02:25:49.663]  He said a large percentage.
[02:25:49.723 --> 02:25:57.289]  So, of this, I mean, listen, I wish I could get the same support from the audience, but they know Ron Paul needs the support and is the winner.
[02:25:57.770 --> 02:26:01.453]  And yes, people should donate to Ron Paul and just continue the momentum.
[02:26:02.532 --> 02:26:11.341]  Um, you know, you're not going to stop the war with Hillary or Obama and in the Republicans you've got fake conservatives, Benito Giuliani and...
[02:26:11.812 --> 02:26:14.074]  CFR, Fred Thompson, and Flip-Flop Romney.
[02:26:14.094 --> 02:26:16.917]  He's the only answer, and I couldn't be more excited about him.
[02:26:16.957 --> 02:26:19.619]  Thank you for bringing him to us, because I think you helped encourage him.
[02:26:19.939 --> 02:26:22.902]  Well, see, that's what's beautiful, though, sir, and what's beautiful about your call.
[02:26:23.062 --> 02:26:25.544]  It's sane, it's rational, it's focused.
[02:26:25.644 --> 02:26:28.487]  It isn't about what group or background we're from.
[02:26:28.507 --> 02:26:29.408]  We're all good people.
[02:26:29.448 --> 02:26:30.489]  We all love America.
[02:26:30.729 --> 02:26:31.549]  We all love freedom.
[02:26:31.570 --> 02:26:34.492]  People listening globally love their countries.
[02:26:34.752 --> 02:26:36.674]  We're coming together for liberty and freedom.
[02:26:36.714 --> 02:26:38.756]  These labels mean nothing!
[02:26:39.895 --> 02:26:46.556]  And while you're campaigning for Ron Paul, I want to throw out, there's a band called Poker Face.
[02:26:46.596 --> 02:26:48.657]  They've got a webpage, pokerface.com.
[02:26:48.697 --> 02:26:51.257]  They really fired me up, too, because they're very anti-New World Order.
[02:26:51.277 --> 02:26:53.598]  Oh, they've got some really, really powerful music.
[02:26:54.578 --> 02:27:03.140]  Another thing that you brought me to that was a link to your site, it wasn't one of the most prominently, was mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[02:27:03.340 --> 02:27:05.560]  Brother Michael Diamond, as I said, I'm a Catholic.
[02:27:06.421 --> 02:27:09.083]  They've got a theory out there for $10.
[02:27:09.144 --> 02:27:13.487]  It couldn't have even covered costs with the material they sent me that was dynamite.
[02:27:14.868 --> 02:27:18.271]  It can be a little disturbing, but if people are here, they're ready for the truth.
[02:27:19.051 --> 02:27:25.116]  And they basically prove that we're the Catholic Church, we're the body of Christ.
[02:27:26.297 --> 02:27:29.940]  As Our Lady, if you're Catholic... Listen, we're flat out of time, my friend.
[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:31.021]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:27:31.381 --> 02:27:33.463]  More calls straight ahead on the other side.
[02:27:36.676 --> 02:27:39.738]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.619 --> 02:27:43.381]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.003 --> 02:27:47.423]  Attention!
[02:27:47.523 --> 02:27:50.345]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[02:27:50.645 --> 02:27:54.948]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:27:55.268 --> 02:27:55.949]  Listen closely.
[02:27:56.609 --> 02:28:01.993]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most
[02:28:02.073 --> 02:28:02.333]  I'm good.
[02:28:19.216 --> 02:28:28.680]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[02:28:28.860 --> 02:28:34.502]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.

[02:28:38.504 --> 02:28:41.845]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[02:28:46.368 --> 02:28:51.335]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:28:51.655 --> 02:28:53.537]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:28:53.738 --> 02:28:56.782]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:28:56.962 --> 02:29:00.086]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:29:00.406 --> 02:29:02.249]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:29:02.509 --> 02:29:06.211]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:29:06.491 --> 02:29:09.152]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:29:09.172 --> 02:29:14.034]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:29:14.274 --> 02:29:18.556]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:29:18.956 --> 02:29:23.298]  The Bible says, Would like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[02:29:23.618 --> 02:29:27.860]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:31.862]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy, tyrants and wars,
[02:29:32.362 --> 02:29:32.802]  We're good.
[02:29:46.582 --> 02:29:48.122]  Looking for a new cooling system?
[02:29:48.563 --> 02:29:53.464]  Enjoy comfort this summer season with the new Carrier or Kenmore system from a name you can trust.

[02:30:42.194 --> 02:30:42.935]  That's 1-800-241-0746.
[02:30:42.975 --> 02:30:45.817]  Some folks are born.
[02:30:57.746 --> 02:31:03.150]  Some folks are born to make the way to fly.
[02:31:03.250 --> 02:31:06.032]  The red, white, and blue.
[02:31:06.353 --> 02:31:08.314]  The red, white, and blue.
[02:31:11.574 --> 02:31:18.197]  Rodney, Gavin, Mike, Todd, Mike.
[02:31:18.257 --> 02:31:23.540]  We've got a ton of weight back on them.
[02:31:23.600 --> 02:31:26.321]  I'm going to get to all of you before we end the show.
[02:31:26.341 --> 02:31:29.703]  We've got to move quicker with everybody.
[02:31:29.723 --> 02:31:33.625]  Before I do that, I want to tell you about a great sponsor.
[02:31:33.765 --> 02:31:39.908]  Bad Nutrition is a breeding ground for illness due to stress and anxiety, not to mention loving chemtrails.
[02:31:40.686 --> 02:31:42.908]  Ask yourself, what is your diet like?
[02:31:42.948 --> 02:31:47.391]  Processed foods and even good organics don't have the nutritional values you need in today's world.
[02:31:47.731 --> 02:31:48.251]  Think about it.
[02:31:48.491 --> 02:31:51.714]  Have you forgotten that you're supposed to feel good and energetic all day long?
[02:31:52.054 --> 02:31:54.456]  And if not, you aren't getting the nutrition you need?
[02:31:54.476 --> 02:31:59.419]  Stop wishing you had more energy and focus and make it happen today with one simple phone call.
[02:32:01.240 --> 02:32:06.303]  1-866-762-9238 or visit them on the web at erenfood.com.
[02:32:06.603 --> 02:32:10.486]  That's enterfood.com or 1-866-762-9238.
[02:32:10.866 --> 02:32:11.827]  Great green food.
[02:32:11.947 --> 02:32:12.407]  I take it.
[02:32:12.427 --> 02:32:15.109]  Go check out the info at enterfood.com.
[02:32:15.509 --> 02:32:23.434]  Another great product is Shilacene from Shilakit in the mountains there in Tibet and into Nepal from both places.
[02:32:24.314 --> 02:32:26.796]  84 different types of minerals in ionic form.
[02:32:27.376 --> 02:32:27.857]  We're good to go!
[02:32:44.711 --> 02:32:49.136]  That's how much they believe in the product, and I'm taking it, Aaron Dykes is taking it, and it's powerful stuff.
[02:32:49.696 --> 02:32:55.242]  Blacklistedherb.com, blacklistedherb.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, or blacklistedherb.com.
[02:32:55.262 --> 02:32:57.184]  Let us now go to Rodney in Texas.
[02:32:57.244 --> 02:32:58.125]  Rodney, thanks for holding.
[02:33:08.419 --> 02:33:09.640]  Hey, thanks Alex.
[02:33:09.660 --> 02:33:13.601]  I haven't been able to get in for a while, man, but great show.
[02:33:14.121 --> 02:33:16.002]  I have three things I want to ask you about.
[02:33:16.042 --> 02:33:27.267]  Number one, I'd like to hear more of these cockroaches that Margaret Sanger used in the black community to help her to carry out her killing spree.
[02:33:27.827 --> 02:33:34.450]  I know that you named off Du Bois, and I was always suspicious of him, but you confirmed it.
[02:33:34.670 --> 02:33:37.211]  And also, you were talking about
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:41.162]  Oh, the interview with David Rothschild.
[02:33:41.862 --> 02:33:47.065]  At the end of that interview, he said, go get me some food.
[02:33:47.085 --> 02:33:52.669]  And I wasn't sure exactly what he meant by that, but it sounded very condescending.
[02:33:54.650 --> 02:33:57.652]  I'll just leave it at those two items.
[02:33:57.672 --> 02:33:59.593]  I'd like to hear what you have to say about that.
[02:34:01.014 --> 02:34:03.235]  A lot of people noticed that he said that.
[02:34:03.275 --> 02:34:04.376]  It's very, very bizarre.
[02:34:05.503 --> 02:34:11.666]  I mean, I'd like to think it was him being arrogant like I was a slave, but I think it was when I said, evil people who are involved in the New World Order.
[02:34:11.926 --> 02:34:14.207]  And I said, I don't know if you are, but you're pushing an agenda.
[02:34:14.607 --> 02:34:16.487]  We'll be brought to justice and we'll be put in prison.
[02:34:16.828 --> 02:34:18.928]  And he said, OK, then go get me some food.
[02:34:19.249 --> 02:34:21.970]  He's saying, yeah, I'm involved in the New World Order, OK.
[02:34:22.330 --> 02:34:25.711]  Bring me some food to my jail cell, I think is what he was saying.
[02:34:25.731 --> 02:34:31.994]  But what do you think about him, and I brought it up three times, saying yes, Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars are closer to the Sun.
[02:34:34.190 --> 02:34:35.672]  I think he caught him off guard.
[02:34:35.733 --> 02:34:43.484]  I think he thought that you were going to be a sucker because a lot of people are not familiar with the alignment of the planets.
[02:34:44.285 --> 02:34:49.774]  I think he thought that you were going to be a sucker and just kind of gloss over that and go along with it.
[02:34:51.673 --> 02:34:55.275]  You were very excellent and I'm so glad that you didn't back down.
[02:35:09.964 --> 02:35:10.404]  I don't think so.
[02:35:33.212 --> 02:35:35.253]  Yeah, folks, armchair quarterbacking.
[02:35:35.593 --> 02:35:40.134]  You know, we're on the field here, and at least my producer, Trey Kincaid, got him on.
[02:35:42.655 --> 02:35:44.976]  Plus, he just kept interrupting everything and just denying.
[02:35:45.276 --> 02:35:48.637]  He knew that when he's dealing with the general public, they're not informed.
[02:35:49.058 --> 02:35:50.798]  He didn't know that this audience isn't stupid.
[02:35:51.638 --> 02:35:55.540]  Now, the other thing, I noticed that he has the same mannerisms.
[02:35:56.963 --> 02:36:02.531]  George Bush and John Kerry had when they were confronting with the skull and bone question.
[02:36:02.551 --> 02:36:06.296]  You remember how they both giggled and tried to play it off?
[02:36:06.843 --> 02:36:12.727]  Well, when you were confronting him with the truth, you notice he had the same type of mannerisms.
[02:36:13.167 --> 02:36:16.650]  I don't know if that's a ploy, a trick that these people use.
[02:36:17.150 --> 02:36:17.470]  No, no.
[02:36:17.850 --> 02:36:20.512]  Listen, it's all about they lie to you, even if you know it's a lie.
[02:36:20.552 --> 02:36:21.713]  It's about, does it matter?
[02:36:21.853 --> 02:36:22.814]  I say reality exists.
[02:36:22.854 --> 02:36:24.595]  Like Karl Rove said, he controls reality.
[02:36:24.615 --> 02:36:25.856]  Does it matter what we do?
[02:36:26.356 --> 02:36:27.217]  No, they're not conservatives.
[02:36:27.237 --> 02:36:27.817]  They say they are.
[02:36:28.077 --> 02:36:28.718]  It is amnesty.
[02:36:28.738 --> 02:36:29.358]  They say it isn't.
[02:36:29.738 --> 02:36:31.900]  They're openly setting up the North American Union.
[02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:32.720]  They say it doesn't exist.
[02:36:32.740 --> 02:36:35.542]  And then they also laugh at you like you don't have a chance.
[02:36:38.023 --> 02:36:42.665]  It's all done to demoralize you and make you think you don't have power.
[02:36:43.285 --> 02:36:43.645]  Okay.
[02:36:43.845 --> 02:36:51.567]  The other thing is, man, this series that you and Aaron Dykes are doing on eugenics, I'd like to hear more.
[02:36:51.627 --> 02:36:59.809]  I think that any time you can shine a spotlight on these rats and watch them run for cover, I don't care if they're dead or they're alive.
[02:37:00.467 --> 02:37:01.870]  The truth is good.
[02:37:02.131 --> 02:37:02.972]  It's good medicine.
[02:37:03.734 --> 02:37:07.341]  Even for the ones that... We're going to get into Friday for an hour and a half.
[02:37:07.361 --> 02:37:11.049]  We're going to get into from the 60s to present and in the future.
[02:37:11.913 --> 02:37:23.965]  I hear more of these names of the black leaders that are there, because I actually did just a little research on the Negro Project that was started by Sanger, but I stopped.
[02:37:24.045 --> 02:37:29.211]  I never actually got to the names of the black leaders in the community that were actually involved in it.
[02:37:29.451 --> 02:37:31.072]  Oh, I've got the actual letters.
[02:37:31.153 --> 02:37:32.374]  I've got the actual letters.
[02:37:33.174 --> 02:37:34.795]  Well, I want to hear more names.
[02:37:35.055 --> 02:37:46.959]  It was a little shocking today to hear Du Bois, but I do know that he said that he moved to Ghana at the end of his, I guess, his life and became a communist.
[02:37:46.999 --> 02:37:52.181]  I don't know if he probably already was a communist based on what... Oh yeah, we got pictures of him with Mao, yeah.
[02:37:52.941 --> 02:37:53.622]  Oh my God.
[02:37:53.942 --> 02:38:00.184]  You know, I actually heard a prominent talk show host in Chicago on a powerful radio station
[02:38:00.814 --> 02:38:12.792]  I confronted him with this thing with Miles Killings and how a lot of our people here in this country, Rockefellers and people like that, John McCain, and these people actually claim Miles was great.
[02:38:13.297 --> 02:38:20.102]  This guy actually said on his show, and I think he might have caught some flack from me, he said, well, Ma was great in many ways.
[02:38:20.142 --> 02:38:20.843]  Now guess what?
[02:38:20.943 --> 02:38:32.132]  This guy's educated at one of those schools out there, Harvard, Yale, and it kind of didn't surprise me, but at the same time, I think that he kind of had a slip of the tongue.
[02:38:33.753 --> 02:38:34.353]  Absolutely.
[02:38:34.373 --> 02:38:35.174]  Good job, Rodney.
[02:38:35.194 --> 02:38:35.834]  I appreciate you.
[02:38:35.874 --> 02:38:37.055]  And they do have slips of the tongue.
[02:38:37.636 --> 02:38:40.218]  Because, you know, they're used to talking to each other behind closed doors.
[02:38:41.081 --> 02:38:43.263]  No, no, I've got all the letters, the books, all of it.
[02:38:43.323 --> 02:38:48.667]  I mean, she's like talking to, she's writing letters to Gamble, Procter & Gamble Fortune.
[02:38:49.408 --> 02:38:51.249]  She's writing letters to this person.
[02:38:51.269 --> 02:38:52.570]  She's all fun about David Rockefeller.
[02:38:52.590 --> 02:38:54.732]  Well, not about David, about John D. Rockefeller Jr.
[02:38:55.653 --> 02:38:57.814]  And they're all running the operation.
[02:38:57.834 --> 02:38:59.355]  David was around at the time, though, and pushing it.
[02:39:00.657 --> 02:39:04.560]  The Rockefellers run 40-plus eugenics societies in New York right now.
[02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:06.621]  I mean, they didn't stop, folks.
[02:39:06.641 --> 02:39:07.522]  They just kept rolling.
[02:39:08.711 --> 02:39:10.932]  But, I mean, I ought to read these letters on air.
[02:39:11.032 --> 02:39:17.235]  We're putting a few of them, I think we only have time to put one of them in the film, where she goes, we don't want the blacks to figure out, we want to exterminate them.
[02:39:17.675 --> 02:39:26.959]  But she says that that's why we need to recruit black leaders and black physicians who agree with us, and then, because the blacks don't trust us, but they'll trust other blacks.
[02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:34.883]  I mean, it's just, believe me folks, the black leaders you see on TV are exactly the same.
[02:39:36.454 --> 02:39:40.579]  Let me tell you something, a black leader really starts leading black people, he's dead in about 10 minutes.
[02:39:43.182 --> 02:39:43.502]  Alright?
[02:39:43.782 --> 02:39:44.403]  It's that simple.
[02:39:46.325 --> 02:39:51.271]  They've got a special place in their heart in the New World Order for running game on black people.
[02:39:53.178 --> 02:39:55.400]  And, uh, it's just so sick.
[02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:56.981]  I mean, a great society.
[02:39:57.001 --> 02:40:01.164]  We're going to give the government, the Democrats love you.
[02:40:01.584 --> 02:40:17.476]  We're going to make sure you have children, but no man in the house, and make sure you only have one or two children, and we're going to put Planned Parenthoods in all your communities, and we're going to get you on welfare, and we're going to CPS your kids, and you're going to go from only 10% in legitimacy to over 90% in legitimacy with your children.
[02:40:18.216 --> 02:40:22.039]  And we're going to ship all the drugs in and sell them in your community, and that's going to be the red light district.
[02:40:22.617 --> 02:40:28.423]  And then your black leaders, your local leaders, are going to run around and squawk and stuff whenever some cop shoots a black kid.
[02:40:28.783 --> 02:40:29.604]  But that's about it.
[02:40:30.025 --> 02:40:32.687]  The CPS is killing them and murdering them and drugging them.
[02:40:32.927 --> 02:40:34.970]  That's all going to be kept real quiet.
[02:40:36.131 --> 02:40:40.255]  I don't see the Hispanic leaders out when I have gone out and fought for their children.
[02:40:42.242 --> 02:40:43.323]  I've been to the courthouses.
[02:40:43.844 --> 02:40:44.344]  I've been there.
[02:40:44.384 --> 02:40:44.925]  I've marched.
[02:40:45.005 --> 02:40:46.066]  I've gotten in the faces.
[02:40:46.406 --> 02:40:48.589]  I've been there when they're taking Mexicans' babies.
[02:40:49.450 --> 02:40:54.675]  Back when I was just doing a local show and the Once a Week TV show, I mean, I went out probably 50 plus times.
[02:40:55.115 --> 02:40:56.497]  And I frankly couldn't handle it anymore.
[02:40:56.517 --> 02:40:57.618]  It was too painful.
[02:40:57.638 --> 02:41:00.781]  I would get emotionally involved watching these families cry and this stuff.
[02:41:00.801 --> 02:41:02.103]  That is what changed me, folks.
[02:41:02.443 --> 02:41:03.023]  And I just...
[02:41:03.957 --> 02:41:05.799]  I just cannot believe the stuff I've seen.
[02:41:05.819 --> 02:41:13.005]  Your Mexican leaders do not care about you, and your black leaders don't care about you, and your white yuppie leaders don't care about you.
[02:41:13.185 --> 02:41:17.209]  They're all in the same club laughing at all of us, and I'm sick of it!
[02:41:17.969 --> 02:41:25.576]  And I want to get up my hands on every single one of them, and I want juries of their peers to find them guilty.
[02:41:26.617 --> 02:41:30.340]  And I want them to hang high.
[02:41:31.852 --> 02:41:33.273]  And we can do it, folks.
[02:41:33.373 --> 02:41:35.954]  We can take this Republic back.
[02:41:36.334 --> 02:41:38.715]  And there won't be any more grabbing people's children.
[02:41:38.955 --> 02:41:40.475]  There won't be any more mercury.
[02:41:40.635 --> 02:41:42.596]  There won't be any more of this eugenics!
[02:41:44.657 --> 02:41:46.437]  Now, I'm almost out of time here.
[02:41:46.517 --> 02:41:49.118]  See, one caller, he brings up so many important points.
[02:41:50.879 --> 02:41:52.940]  I'm just telling the New World Order, we are going to get you.
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:54.400]  We are going to get you.
[02:41:55.241 --> 02:41:58.342]  And a lot of us won't make it to sea that day, but it is going to happen.
[02:41:58.902 --> 02:42:00.003]  You are going to fall.
[02:42:00.303 --> 02:42:01.163]  You are going to fail.
[02:42:01.952 --> 02:42:05.273]  You just better put that in your pipe and you better smoke that!
[02:42:06.814 --> 02:42:12.996]  Let's go ahead and uh... Let's talk to Mike in Pennsylvania.
[02:42:13.016 --> 02:42:15.456]  He's at Ground Zero with WeAreChange.org.
[02:42:15.556 --> 02:42:15.997]  Great folks.
[02:42:16.017 --> 02:42:18.437]  They've been on the great reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:42:18.837 --> 02:42:23.159]  Mike, what's going on there at the new Building 7 side of the New World Order crime operation?
[02:42:23.539 --> 02:42:27.780]  Well, just minutes ago, Alex, we just put one of the largest protests in front of Building 7.
[02:42:28.260 --> 02:42:29.681]  We actually had four banners
[02:42:30.542 --> 02:42:34.104]  And these guys in Building 7 just refuse to come out now.
[02:42:34.844 --> 02:42:37.205]  They simply cower in fear from behind the counter.
[02:42:37.225 --> 02:42:40.927]  This is the same goons that tried to claim you had bombs and were terrorists?
[02:42:41.347 --> 02:42:42.127]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:42:42.167 --> 02:42:48.610]  In fact, now they know the name Alex Jones, they know the name Infowars.com, and they're not going to touch us with a 10-foot pole.
[02:42:50.211 --> 02:42:51.952]  No, they'll probably just touch me, but that's fine.
[02:42:51.992 --> 02:42:52.432]  I'm ready.
[02:42:53.432 --> 02:42:55.133]  I'm ready to be struck down by the enemy.
[02:42:55.757 --> 02:42:59.698]  Just so long as you guys, after I'm gone, don't let the COINTELPROs ruin my name.
[02:42:59.758 --> 02:43:01.038]  Defend me after I'm gone.
[02:43:01.398 --> 02:43:01.618]  Yeah.
[02:43:01.939 --> 02:43:05.959]  Well, we also, if you go to our site, you're going to see another competition with Alan Combs.
[02:43:06.059 --> 02:43:06.960]  I did the first one.
[02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:09.160]  I was doing camera work on the second one.
[02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:09.960]  That's right.
[02:43:09.980 --> 02:43:11.961]  We need to do a blurb on that for Jones Report.
[02:43:11.981 --> 02:43:13.321]  Because that's a great little piece.
[02:43:13.361 --> 02:43:14.321]  I saw that last night.
[02:43:15.082 --> 02:43:17.702]  Yeah, you can see in the video basically what happens.
[02:43:17.722 --> 02:43:21.323]  As soon as he sees the black shirts, he takes off running like a scared little dog.
[02:43:22.143 --> 02:43:24.624]  And, you know, the great thing about it is
[02:43:25.451 --> 02:43:30.812]  Uh, you know, the guy just, uh, you know, he should be scared to go out in public from now on.
[02:43:31.012 --> 02:43:32.813]  You know, these guys are no longer celebrities.
[02:43:33.373 --> 02:43:34.733]  You know, they're complicit in this thing.
[02:43:36.613 --> 02:43:37.054]  They are.
[02:43:37.294 --> 02:43:37.574]  You know?
[02:43:38.094 --> 02:43:39.014]  They are.
[02:43:39.154 --> 02:43:48.736]  We also took over Washington Square Park later on that day, and, uh, for all the people out there that want to say that family members don't support us, we had Manny Padilla with us, and he took over the Bullhorn.
[02:43:49.355 --> 02:43:52.537]  And YouTube was there doing a big thing, and we took over.
[02:43:52.597 --> 02:43:54.778]  We had four banners, about 20 people.
[02:43:55.658 --> 02:43:56.179]  It was great.
[02:43:57.079 --> 02:43:59.060]  I need to get all you guys on for a show.
[02:43:59.140 --> 02:44:00.701]  You are doing just fabulous work.
[02:44:00.761 --> 02:44:06.604]  Everybody's duplicating the actions that we've taken, now that you've taken, and that's how it grows from there.
[02:44:06.985 --> 02:44:08.225]  It is an unstoppable force.
[02:44:08.265 --> 02:44:09.166]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:44:09.246 --> 02:44:14.188]  Well, let me just also say that the rest of today's 11th Action is going on live on the Internet.
[02:44:14.208 --> 02:44:17.050]  If you go to wearechange.org, you can watch the whole festivities.
[02:44:17.529 --> 02:44:18.450]  Fantastic, Mike.
[02:44:19.010 --> 02:44:20.351]  I really appreciate your call.
[02:44:20.371 --> 02:44:23.933]  All right, now back to the plugs for 9-11 Truth.
[02:44:24.354 --> 02:44:26.115]  Let's go back to Johnny Wave.
[02:44:26.195 --> 02:44:29.877]  I believe he's a young Marine who's been going out and protesting and demonstrating.
[02:44:29.897 --> 02:44:31.098]  You got cut off earlier.
[02:44:31.138 --> 02:44:31.519]  Go ahead.
[02:44:32.059 --> 02:44:32.539]  Yes, sir.
[02:44:32.579 --> 02:44:33.540]  I'm sorry about that.
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:35.001]  I am a young Marine.
[02:44:35.021 --> 02:44:42.906]  I am under contract with the Marine Corps right now, and I'm asking all service members to come out and protect our country from enemies both foreign and domestic.
[02:44:44.307 --> 02:44:46.669]  Well, yeah, you were plugging something when you got disconnected.
[02:44:47.325 --> 02:44:50.426]  Oh, I was plugging TruthAction.org.
[02:44:51.267 --> 02:44:54.368]  That is our website to get involved with Truth Action.
[02:44:54.388 --> 02:44:58.229]  That's how I became involved just earlier this year.
[02:44:58.970 --> 02:45:02.851]  And we're growing just like wildfire right now, Alex.
[02:45:03.031 --> 02:45:04.192]  It's really inspiring.
[02:45:04.212 --> 02:45:09.274]  I remember when I first had the Truth Action guys on and it really kicked off.
[02:45:09.314 --> 02:45:10.554]  That's fabulous.
[02:45:10.614 --> 02:45:12.855]  And same with We Are Change and everybody.
[02:45:12.895 --> 02:45:14.756]  And I'm just glad that you woke up.
[02:45:14.936 --> 02:45:15.616]  How did you wake up?
[02:45:16.383 --> 02:45:19.524]  Yeah, it was a philosophy class I was in.
[02:45:19.564 --> 02:45:37.991]  I was going to college after the Marine Corps, and they showed me Freedom to Fascism as well as Loose Change, and they turned me on to you and your show, and it was quite... I mean, the months that I spent researching all of this after I would listen to you, because
[02:45:38.686 --> 02:45:40.947]  You were telling us, you know, don't just listen to me.
[02:45:41.307 --> 02:45:54.751]  Go out, research it for yourself, and I took that time out to really figure what was going on, and it was a big change in my life, and I've come to the decision that we've got to stop this, and this is where I'm dedicating myself.
[02:45:54.911 --> 02:45:55.311]  We do.
[02:45:55.431 --> 02:45:56.372]  We can never stop.
[02:45:56.412 --> 02:45:57.212]  Good to hear from you.
[02:45:57.232 --> 02:45:58.452]  I'll have you on as a guest sometime.
[02:45:58.472 --> 02:46:00.093]  I really appreciate your call.
[02:46:01.073 --> 02:46:04.054]  Let's now go ahead and talk to Gavin in California.
[02:46:04.074 --> 02:46:04.394]  Gavin, go ahead.
[02:46:06.912 --> 02:46:13.977]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to call and give you and your listeners an intelligence brief that I received.
[02:46:15.759 --> 02:46:17.520]  I want to give you my background.
[02:46:17.540 --> 02:46:24.866]  I am a high-ranking Mason in both the Scottish Rite and Commandery of San Diego.
[02:46:24.886 --> 02:46:35.554]  I regularly meet with people who are in the Council of Foreign Relations and Navy SEALs, intelligence people.
[02:46:39.083 --> 02:46:52.133]  And basically what everybody has come to conclude is that it looks like the attack is going to happen in August during what's called the Dog Days.
[02:46:53.074 --> 02:46:56.196]  A lot of people are thinking that it's going to be August 23rd.
[02:46:56.857 --> 02:47:01.681]  Now let me give you a little background on this so you can understand why this time period.
[02:47:04.763 --> 02:47:07.805]  In masonry, there's what's called the blazing star.
[02:47:07.905 --> 02:47:11.348]  And what this is, is it's the star Sirius.
[02:47:11.949 --> 02:47:17.313]  Now, during the dog days of summer, this is when the sun lines up with Sirius.
[02:47:17.373 --> 02:47:22.698]  And in the ancient days, they believed that Sirius added energy to the sun, and this is why it was hot.
[02:47:23.718 --> 02:47:30.204]  Now, a lot of the ritual murders or terrorist attacks, or whatever you want to call these things,
[02:47:31.050 --> 02:47:35.314]  are done in conjunction with astronomical events.
[02:47:35.414 --> 02:47:42.179]  Now we've seen that in the past, like they attacked Iraq when Mars was closest to Earth in that couple hundred year cycle.
[02:47:42.860 --> 02:47:47.223]  But sir, I mean, if you are one of these high-ranking masons, why are you calling into the show to tell us this?
[02:47:48.865 --> 02:47:55.250]  Well, because, the way I look at it, the only way to stop these types of things is you get in them.
[02:47:55.819 --> 02:47:58.501]  You go to the core and you blow it up from the inside.
[02:47:58.521 --> 02:48:02.983]  So what degree in the Masonic Order are you?
[02:48:03.984 --> 02:48:08.447]  I'm a 32nd degree Scottish Rite and I'm Knights Templar.
[02:48:09.708 --> 02:48:12.549]  I'm involved in international dealings.
[02:48:12.730 --> 02:48:17.152]  I'm being groomed right now for some stuff I'm going to be doing in Turkey in 2010.
[02:48:20.968 --> 02:48:24.030]  Well, I'd like you to give me some more info so I can maybe have you on as a guest sometime.
[02:48:24.410 --> 02:48:30.895]  I actually would appreciate that because it's getting to the point where I'm actually starting to get a lot of heat, so... Oh, really?
[02:48:31.075 --> 02:48:32.496]  They know you're speaking out?
[02:48:33.316 --> 02:48:36.558]  I've had my house broken into and had a death threat left.
[02:48:36.599 --> 02:48:40.981]  Well, then they wouldn't be grooming you anymore, though, if they found out what you're doing.
[02:48:41.842 --> 02:48:42.863]  Stay there.
[02:48:42.883 --> 02:48:43.883]  I'm going to talk to you during the break.
[02:48:44.164 --> 02:48:45.785]  We'll come back to him in a few final calls, too.
[02:48:45.805 --> 02:48:46.185]  Stay with us.
[02:48:49.602 --> 02:48:50.103]  It's here!
[02:48:50.323 --> 02:48:55.107]  After a year in production and traveling the distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:55.447 --> 02:49:03.094]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.795 --> 02:49:10.837]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:11.237 --> 02:49:22.679]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:26.460]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:28.901]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:29.201 --> 02:49:33.042]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:46.266 --> 02:50:50.331]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:50:50.531 --> 02:50:53.935]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:50:54.115 --> 02:50:57.619]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:50:57.859 --> 02:51:01.123]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:51:01.143 --> 02:51:06.509]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[02:51:07.230 --> 02:51:08.011]  Thank you very much.
[02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:28.131]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:51:28.172 --> 02:51:29.532]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:51:29.712 --> 02:51:33.613]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[02:51:53.555 --> 02:51:56.417]  Well, Gavin says he's going to send me his documentation.
[02:51:57.518 --> 02:52:02.062]  And it checks out, we'll have him on about this big internal battle going on in Masonry.
[02:52:02.102 --> 02:52:03.323]  I know that's always going on.
[02:52:04.164 --> 02:52:06.886]  So we'll, uh, maybe get him on next week for an hour or something.
[02:52:08.488 --> 02:52:10.650]  Mike and Todd are the last two callers we have time for.
[02:52:10.790 --> 02:52:12.291]  Or, or, who's the next two in line here?
[02:52:14.012 --> 02:52:14.553]  Okay, okay.
[02:52:15.561 --> 02:52:17.922]  Mike in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:52:20.843 --> 02:52:24.665]  Or maybe... Okay, Mike in Chicago, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:52:24.985 --> 02:52:25.806]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:52:25.966 --> 02:52:26.206]  Good.
[02:52:26.906 --> 02:52:33.289]  I was watching WTDW the other day, and they had a program on... WTDWs are in Chicago, it's our local PBS station.
[02:52:33.909 --> 02:52:44.294]  They had a program on it called Churchill's Girl, and it was about a woman by the name of Pamela Digby, who ended up marrying Winston Churchill's grandson, I believe it was.
[02:52:45.043 --> 02:52:57.288]  She was also the mistress of Baron Rothschild, was crucial to Clinton's election, created a committee called Democrats for the 80s and Democrats for the 90s, and ended up U.S.
[02:52:57.348 --> 02:52:58.469]  Ambassador to France.
[02:52:58.889 --> 02:53:04.451]  Oh yeah, I've got People Magazine with Rothschild we had on last week as the young new star.
[02:53:04.631 --> 02:53:06.132]  They definitely run things.
[02:53:06.472 --> 02:53:12.635]  The interesting thing was in 71 she married Everill Harriman of Brown Brothers Harriman.
[02:53:14.033 --> 02:53:21.015]  So there is a direct tie between Harriman, Bush's grandfather, and Bill Clinton getting elected to president.
[02:53:22.024 --> 02:53:22.844]  All tied together.
[02:53:23.225 --> 02:53:26.846]  The Bushes met 11 times with Clinton the year before he ran.
[02:53:27.646 --> 02:53:28.626]  It's totally staged.
[02:53:28.786 --> 02:53:31.187]  It's all Fox News is behind Hillary.
[02:53:31.787 --> 02:53:33.508]  I'll leave it to this because I know there's another guy.
[02:53:33.528 --> 02:53:39.770]  I agree that 9-11 is important but it fits into a much bigger picture and people have to get that through their heads.
[02:53:39.870 --> 02:53:46.712]  It's an entry point for people to question what's been going on but it is a small facet of a much larger picture.
[02:53:46.972 --> 02:53:48.873]  It's just an incident they used to
[02:53:48.973 --> 02:53:49.553]  I'm good to go.
[02:54:09.875 --> 02:54:12.996]  Everybody thinks you're picking one issue and just driving it into the ground.
[02:54:13.216 --> 02:54:15.777]  Listen, you're very articulate and I appreciate it.
[02:54:15.797 --> 02:54:16.858]  I hope you call again, Mike.
[02:54:17.198 --> 02:54:20.980]  Why don't you write up a three-paragraph blurb with your bibliography.
[02:54:21.260 --> 02:54:23.060]  Send it to Aaron and InfoWars.com.
[02:54:23.100 --> 02:54:23.661]  We'll post it.
[02:54:24.161 --> 02:54:28.523]  Because we need people who've made these, and I was aware of that by the way, who've made these connections to help us.
[02:54:28.563 --> 02:54:29.343]  We can't do it all.
[02:54:29.383 --> 02:54:31.744]  We don't have the money, the staff, the personnel.
[02:54:32.024 --> 02:54:32.524]  Write it up.
[02:54:32.604 --> 02:54:34.245]  Send it to Aaron and InfoWars.com.
[02:54:34.865 --> 02:54:38.889]  Or send it to submissions at Infowars.com and we will get that stuff up on the sites.
[02:54:38.909 --> 02:54:39.569]  We'll get it dug.
[02:54:39.589 --> 02:54:40.410]  We'll get it out to people.
[02:54:40.690 --> 02:54:41.791]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[02:54:42.291 --> 02:54:44.293]  Yeah, I mean, I tell people that it's all staged.
[02:54:44.353 --> 02:54:45.614]  I mean, it's staged, folks.
[02:54:46.855 --> 02:54:48.096]  People are getting that now, though.
[02:54:48.116 --> 02:54:48.276]  Okay?
[02:54:48.296 --> 02:54:49.117]  For the first time ever.
[02:54:50.158 --> 02:54:52.039]  Let's go ahead and talk to Todd in Texas.
[02:54:52.079 --> 02:54:52.520]  Last caller.
[02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:53.440]  Go ahead and take us out, Todd.
[02:54:54.241 --> 02:54:55.482]  Hi, I'm going to take us out, Alex.
[02:54:55.642 --> 02:54:56.283]  Good to talk to you.
[02:54:56.323 --> 02:55:00.006]  I'm a first-time caller and I just want to rant for a second.
[02:55:00.346 --> 02:55:01.387]  I'm in Austin, Texas.
[02:55:01.912 --> 02:55:07.235]  I'm sick and tired of people denying that there's any kind of Masonic conspiracy.
[02:55:07.295 --> 02:55:08.856]  Let's talk about Austin, Texas.
[02:55:09.096 --> 02:55:16.340]  Founded by Edward Burleson, Meribu Lamar, Stephen S. Austin, all high-degree Freemasons.
[02:55:16.940 --> 02:55:25.985]  Edward Burleson and Meribu Lamar, high, high-level Freemasons, murderers, genocide, came here, killed all the natives.
[02:55:26.445 --> 02:55:28.526]  The people in Waco, from today,
[02:55:29.079 --> 02:55:31.740]  Look at the Indians of Waco back then.
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:34.081]  They killed them all genocide style.
[02:55:34.101 --> 02:55:35.882]  They said leave or die.
[02:55:36.402 --> 02:55:44.785]  That is the foundation of our... Listen, you gotta learn, son, that if you want to get on air, and you want to talk, you've got the floor.
[02:55:44.905 --> 02:55:46.826]  But you can't use profanity.
[02:55:46.846 --> 02:55:47.806]  Okay?
[02:55:47.886 --> 02:55:48.866]  Don't call my show again.
[02:55:50.367 --> 02:55:51.848]  Until you can learn to straighten your mouth up.
[02:55:52.708 --> 02:55:56.209]  This is a free speech show, but it's not here for you to wipe your hinds ends with it.
[02:55:56.249 --> 02:55:56.649]  I'm sorry.
[02:55:57.250 --> 02:55:58.210]  I apologize for that little...
[02:55:59.456 --> 02:56:00.437]  Delving into English.
[02:56:00.657 --> 02:56:01.518]  Non-King's English.
[02:56:02.339 --> 02:56:05.001]  I'll be back tonight 9 to midnight central here on the network.
[02:56:05.502 --> 02:56:09.285]  We have a restreams 23 hours, 21 hours a day after the show ends.
[02:56:10.526 --> 02:56:13.368]  And you also have the free podcast at m4awards.com.
[02:56:13.428 --> 02:56:14.810]  Please spread the word about that.
[02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:19.494]  That's something that will have an effect that will wake people up that you can do on the web.
[02:56:19.934 --> 02:56:20.174]  All right.
[02:56:20.234 --> 02:56:21.095]  God bless you all.
[02:56:21.155 --> 02:56:21.596]  Take care.
[02:56:21.636 --> 02:56:23.017]  We'll see you back tomorrow.
