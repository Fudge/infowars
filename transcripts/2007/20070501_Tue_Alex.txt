[00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:06.296]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:08.037]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:09.858]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.498 --> 00:00:11.319]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:12.960]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.263]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.823 --> 00:00:21.926]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:32.313]  I... turned on my computer.
[00:00:36.584 --> 00:00:37.864]  Well, I guess I didn't turn it on.
[00:00:37.884 --> 00:00:42.585]  I was surfing on the internet at about midnight last night.
[00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:57.529]  I'd been on a syndicated show in Canada, and I was surfing around, and I clicked on the BBC's website, and I was shocked to read this headline.
[00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.350]  Now, I guess I really shouldn't have been shocked, but I was shocked.
[00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.590]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:04.384 --> 00:01:08.126]  It is already the first day of May 2007.
[00:01:09.327 --> 00:01:15.751]  And we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:01:17.372 --> 00:01:21.135]  US and EU agree on single market.
[00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:25.918]  That is the BBC News headline.
[00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:39.416]  Underneath that it says, the United States and the European Union have signed up to a new transatlantic economic partnership at a summit in Washington.
[00:01:39.656 --> 00:01:42.797]  And I knew this was airing on C-SPAN.
[00:01:42.877 --> 00:01:43.878]  I had not watched it.
[00:01:44.498 --> 00:01:47.800]  Much of the summit was behind closed doors, but they do have some press conferences.
[00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:51.542]  We need to judiciously, when that re-airs, tape that.
[00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:54.524]  Hint, hint to the audience who wants to help us.
[00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:57.672]  Or at least order that from C-SPAN.
[00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:09.915]  Historically it will be, because within a few weeks if we write articles about this, there will be big national newspapers denying the meeting even took place or the agreement has even been signed.
[00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:16.117]  It's the equivalent of denying the Atlantic Ocean exists.
[00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:24.860]  It's the equivalent of claiming that plants do not engage in photosynthesis, but they will do it.
[00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:29.335]  And the general public will accept it as a fact.
[00:02:29.395 --> 00:02:34.619]  They have been trained from birth to accept any amount of lies or disinformation.
[00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:42.786]  So I thought that coming up later in the shower, I'm going to attempt, or probably fail,
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:53.327]  But at least I'll attempt, that's what matters, to calmly cover exactly how global government works, how it operates, and how it's unfolding for everyone.
[00:02:53.727 --> 00:03:01.714]  I know most of you know more than I do, but we have a lot of listeners, new listeners every day, every week, who don't even know what global government is, or what it means.
[00:03:01.794 --> 00:03:09.580]  They do know about American Idol, and how to act cool, or how to wear the proper clothing, or how to have the coolest hats.
[00:03:10.716 --> 00:03:31.291]  They do not, though, have any idea of the fact that they're setting up a global imperium where the individual has zero rights or liberties, and where one-child policies are enforced, and where eugenics, forced drugging, forced sterilization is enforced, and that's if you're lucky living in a first world nation.
[00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:36.515]  If you're in a third world nation, you are going to be killed nine times out of ten.
[00:03:38.138 --> 00:03:40.180]  I'm sorry to have to announce this to you.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.605]  Of course, those in the third world, most of them don't even have internet or aren't able to hear this transmission or even understand English.
[00:03:46.918 --> 00:03:52.163]  And I am too ignorant to have the proper system set up of my websites to communicate with you.
[00:03:52.763 --> 00:03:55.746]  Even some of the better translation systems don't work too well.
[00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:57.667]  And I can only speak one language.
[00:03:57.707 --> 00:04:01.810]  I can't speak four, I guess five of English fluently like my wife can.
[00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.914]  So I don't mean that as a slight that you're ignorant, that you can't understand me.
[00:04:06.254 --> 00:04:07.976]  It's just their language barriers.
[00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:14.821]  The language itself though, even in English, has been reduced massively, as Eric Blair wrote about in 1984.
[00:04:17.387 --> 00:04:17.587]  I think?
[00:04:34.657 --> 00:04:50.385]  Conversation with a group of founding fathers of the Continental Congress and I mean it when I say that I am a blithering low-grade drooling Moron compared to those men and many of them were drooling morons compared to the Greek philosophers.
[00:04:50.845 --> 00:04:51.526]  We'll be right back
[00:05:02.762 --> 00:05:05.985]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:08.227]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:08.627 --> 00:05:16.234]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:16.952 --> 00:05:24.018]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:24.398 --> 00:05:35.847]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:39.630]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:42.052]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:42.373 --> 00:05:46.156]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:00.422 --> 00:06:09.510]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:20.980]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:26.145]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:26.525]  I think?
[00:06:45.094 --> 00:06:46.094]  Well, let's get a 2-pack.
[00:06:46.294 --> 00:06:46.514]  Only $99.
[00:06:47.114 --> 00:06:48.195]  Or a 4-pack.
[00:06:48.315 --> 00:06:48.475]  Only $188.
[00:06:49.295 --> 00:06:51.355]  Call New Millennium.
[00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:52.315]  888-803-4438.
[00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:54.736]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:55.136 --> 00:06:58.437]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:06:59.537 --> 00:07:02.477]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:07:02.638 --> 00:07:07.899]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:13.440]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.960]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:24.184]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:07:24.684 --> 00:07:26.265]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:07:26.525 --> 00:07:35.369]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[00:07:39.571 --> 00:07:40.352]  Keep it natural.
[00:07:40.652 --> 00:07:44.274]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:44.735 --> 00:07:48.797]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[00:07:49.078 --> 00:07:53.321]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[00:07:53.641 --> 00:07:58.244]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:07:59.685 --> 00:08:01.927]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:02.507 --> 00:08:05.289]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.162 --> 00:08:10.184]  We have a very important broadcast for you.
[00:08:11.264 --> 00:08:27.752]  For the last three years, I've been reporting that they've already been merging the North American Union with the European Union, and there's been snickers and laughs from different neocon and controlled liberal publications, but here it is in the BBC today.
[00:08:28.693 --> 00:08:31.314]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to break down how all this works.
[00:08:31.414 --> 00:08:32.615]  Last week, I aired about 80%
[00:08:34.522 --> 00:08:40.085]  of the most powerful, as if they could get more powerful, Keith Oberman rant I've ever heard.
[00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:41.685]  I want to play the whole thing.
[00:08:41.725 --> 00:08:49.028]  When something's this good, and this truthful, and this strong, it needs to be aired in its entirety.
[00:08:49.068 --> 00:08:51.890]  So that's coming up too in the second hour today.
[00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:59.513]  Also, we've got a bunch of other audio clips we're going to be playing, a bunch of news on the illegal aliens and what they're up to and how they're above the law.
[00:08:59.913 --> 00:09:02.294]  They're planning mass rallies around the country.
[00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.591]  Also, William F. Buckley Jr.
[00:09:04.652 --> 00:09:06.913]  is saying that there's the waning of the GEOP.
[00:09:07.034 --> 00:09:08.094]  Yeah, by design.
[00:09:09.175 --> 00:09:13.299]  Also, we will be getting into ex-CIA top analyst.
[00:09:13.659 --> 00:09:17.543]  Forged Yellow Cake memo leads right back to Dick Cheney.
[00:09:20.145 --> 00:09:24.389]  But before I cover all of that, I want to introduce a friend of mine.
[00:09:24.489 --> 00:09:30.514]  Literally five minutes before showtime, Mike Nelson up here at the office said, Hey, Raymond Teague called up.
[00:09:31.155 --> 00:09:31.435]  I think so.
[00:09:47.327 --> 00:09:50.390]  And I said, look, let's just have Raymond on and see what he has to say.
[00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:55.233]  So, you're basically going to be getting the news just as soon as I get it.
[00:09:55.253 --> 00:09:57.535]  He just says there's something suspicious about it.
[00:09:57.855 --> 00:10:03.360]  And I listened to Raymond because he's a Vietnam weapons system missile operator veteran.
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.384]  He is a degreed engineer, well, I guess electrical engineer.
[00:10:09.044 --> 00:10:12.007]  He is, of course, he was in Air Force Intelligence after that.
[00:10:12.367 --> 00:10:14.749]  He then worked on the Apollo missions in
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:22.044]  I guess the A-Group in Mission Control and on the RCA cameras that were on the moon.
[00:10:23.885 --> 00:10:31.449]  And someday I'm going to get him to come on air and talk about his days there in the Apollo program.
[00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.131]  I've gotten quite a bit out of him in private, but he won't say a lot of it on air.
[00:10:36.532 --> 00:10:42.195]  I've got to get you in studio soon, Raymond, because we don't live forever and I want to get you on air.
[00:10:43.104 --> 00:10:43.545]  I don't think so.
[00:10:58.364 --> 00:11:00.847]  98 when we built Joe Campana a new house.
[00:11:00.867 --> 00:11:10.520]  He was a World War II vet, atomic testing veteran, and the local health department was trying to steal his house because it was worth, he didn't even know this, about 800 grand.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.702]  That was back then because he owned about a half acre.
[00:11:12.722 --> 00:11:13.984]  He could build three or four houses on it.
[00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:15.177]  I'm already digressing.
[00:11:15.197 --> 00:11:16.057]  I've known Raymond for a long time.
[00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:36.369]  Since I was not there physically present, it is very hard to tell
[00:12:03.752 --> 00:12:06.935]  What happened, but I will give you the indications.
[00:12:07.635 --> 00:12:11.999]  The flames seem to be extremely white, bright.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:29.454]  Now, the problem with my judging this on television, especially without knowing the details of the cameras being used and so forth, the ordinary sensors that are on these camcorders make
[00:12:30.006 --> 00:12:35.750]  Fire or thermal imaging look brighter than it actually appears, so it's hard to judge.
[00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:52.560]  But I will tell you, if you observe any of these for yourselves, as the public, if a fire is extremely white, it's extremely hot, this is normally caused not by some burning fuel like gasoline or something.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.963]  It has to be usually an aluminum oxidizer mix of some sort.
[00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.491]  There are many ways to do this.
[00:13:00.831 --> 00:13:12.698]  Anything like you could take roughly powdered, not powdered, but say little small lumps of coal, mix it with any oxidizing agent, potassium chlorate, potassium permanganate.
[00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:15.640]  There's dozens of them that can be used.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.843]  Potassium nitrate, the old oxidizer for black gunpowder.
[00:13:20.916 --> 00:13:31.846]  In a rough mixture form, and you could have this, not necessarily in a tanker truck, but in a trailer, any, just anything, any container that could hold it together until you got it to where you wanted to light it off.
[00:13:31.926 --> 00:13:45.198]  Now, you know, Friday in Houston, another tractor trailer full of gasoline crashed in the exact same type of bridge, in the exact same type of mixmaster, or cloverleaf as they call them, these big interchanges, and nothing collapsed.
[00:13:45.618 --> 00:13:47.159]  Now, I mean, that may just be coincidence.
[00:13:47.179 --> 00:13:48.500]  These things are crashing all the time.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.941]  Bridges are collapsing every month.
[00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:51.102]  I even looked it up.
[00:13:51.162 --> 00:13:54.544]  It's about every 30 days, on average, one of these things collapses on its own.
[00:13:55.345 --> 00:13:58.507]  But I did see the white flashes, and it's pure white.
[00:13:58.527 --> 00:14:01.049]  These are big, high-quality news cameras.
[00:14:01.489 --> 00:14:07.053]  And so normally, I mean, they are more accurate than a cheap camcorder.
[00:14:07.473 --> 00:14:10.255]  But I know what you're talking about, how the differential in the dark
[00:14:10.715 --> 00:14:12.036]  Well, like I said, I wasn't there from the description.
[00:14:12.056 --> 00:14:13.377]  Apparently the truck was pretty well burned up.
[00:14:13.397 --> 00:14:13.577]  If you
[00:14:40.353 --> 00:15:08.916]  If you, as an observer, see something like this going on, and there's the frame of the truck left, and the steel wheels that the tires are mounted on, and the other metal components of the truck are still there, not melted down or burned up, then it could very well be just a fuel fire or an ordinary combustible material fire that might be something really hot like gasoline or kerosene or something like that.
[00:15:09.548 --> 00:15:13.191]  But the steel components of that unit are still going to be there.
[00:15:13.972 --> 00:15:22.339]  But if you have a fire that's hot enough to melt down a bridge, probably it's going to melt the truck totally down.
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.301]  Most of it will be gone.
[00:15:25.421 --> 00:15:29.825]  It will not find anything but pools of metal or burned oxide.
[00:15:30.385 --> 00:15:37.551]  So as an observer, and you observe something of this order, you will know that this did not happen accidentally.
[00:15:39.487 --> 00:16:06.096]  I was listening to a radio show last night and I was amazed at the number of incidents around the country just lately, like in the last two or three weeks, where at these interchanges, strategic choke points on the interstate system, where there have been accidents causing very major damage to it, most of it does not make the major news outside of the local area, so we don't hear about it, but it's been going on from Boston to Florida,
[00:16:07.252 --> 00:16:18.422]  The Midwest and now Oakland, if the interstate highway at the choke points were shut down in this country, the whole transportation system would collapse.
[00:16:18.462 --> 00:16:32.033]  There's not enough auxiliary roads, there's not enough rail transport, there's not enough means of distribution of groceries, gasoline, and other essentials to keep the country running.
[00:16:32.748 --> 00:16:36.390]  Without these roads being intact, and it would not take that much.
[00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:58.499]  In fact, as far as some lone nut, some lone person coming up with enough material to cause one of these events, even if they got a hold of a truck, it would take a major effort and expense to assemble the ingredients necessary to burn one of these highways up.
[00:17:01.132 --> 00:17:11.320]  When somebody in Sacramento, California drove an 18-wheeler full of gasoline into the Capitol, but they kept it real quiet because that was a real terrorist attack.
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:12.702]  It was somebody mad at the government.
[00:17:13.462 --> 00:17:16.565]  Because that was a real attack, they didn't want to create fear.
[00:17:16.885 --> 00:17:21.729]  See, when the government does it, they hype it up and have the cameras and create fear.
[00:17:22.149 --> 00:17:24.111]  But I've talked to a lot of people in and out of government.
[00:17:24.151 --> 00:17:25.212]  There have been hundreds
[00:17:25.652 --> 00:17:26.855]  This has even come out in the news.
[00:17:27.316 --> 00:17:33.728]  Hundreds of real terrorist attacks on refineries, on key infrastructure, that have been kept quiet.
[00:17:34.484 --> 00:17:38.207]  And we've done reports on that, so there may be something to this, Raymond.
[00:17:39.929 --> 00:17:41.570]  I mean, why do you see this as suspicious?
[00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:46.834]  Not just the white flashes and the incredible heat, but all these other incidences in the last month?
[00:17:46.874 --> 00:17:58.164]  The whole thing taken together means a coordinated attack against us that would be extremely effective and yet not cause the reaction that a nuclear attack would cause.
[00:17:58.905 --> 00:18:03.692]  I would say it would be a covert infrastructure attack by somebody.
[00:18:14.247 --> 00:18:18.111]  All I know is this, Raymond, for two years there have been U.S.
[00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:22.475]  Special Forces, admittedly, in Iran attacking infrastructure and funding terrorists.
[00:18:22.876 --> 00:18:23.977]  Now that's on record.
[00:18:24.217 --> 00:18:25.398]  That's been in the Associated Press.
[00:18:25.458 --> 00:18:28.221]  It was broken by Cy Hirsch two years ago.
[00:18:28.281 --> 00:18:30.423]  We even knew about it before that from sources.
[00:18:30.463 --> 00:18:33.266]  But the point is, it's official when it's in the mainstream media.
[00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:35.127]  And so, who knows?
[00:18:35.228 --> 00:18:36.529]  Lord knows what's really going on.
[00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.312]  Well, when you have, you can go on the internet.
[00:18:40.593 --> 00:18:48.599]  I don't know whether it's on your, since I'm not on my cable or a satellite, I don't, I'm not on your site because I have no high-speed data link.
[00:18:49.299 --> 00:19:06.632]  But, I have a, uh, uh, an email showing liquid metal, molten steel, running down from where they're, near where the aircraft struck on the, uh, on a 9-11 tower, running just about to the ground, all the way down the side of the building.
[00:19:07.319 --> 00:19:09.941]  I have worked in a steel mill for more than a year.
[00:19:09.961 --> 00:19:14.423]  And I have seen other steel mills, and I've seen steel poured.
[00:19:15.204 --> 00:19:18.105]  I know what is involved in the heat necessary to do all that.
[00:19:18.906 --> 00:19:20.867]  You would never get it from aircraft fuel.
[00:19:20.947 --> 00:19:24.549]  I've helped clean up aircraft crashes, and that's not what happens.
[00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.491]  You couldn't do that with an aircraft or with an aircraft load of fuel.
[00:19:29.312 --> 00:19:35.936]  But, to get that to happen in a building, the website, people claim that
[00:19:39.889 --> 00:19:42.171]  Sure, we've had Dr. Steven Jones and all of them on the show.
[00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:45.954]  Raymond, thank you for popping in to bring up those interesting points about the truck.
[00:19:46.375 --> 00:19:47.476]  And I'll talk to you soon, my friend.
[00:19:47.496 --> 00:19:48.917]  Come down to the TV show next week, okay?
[00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:49.758]  Okay.
[00:19:50.038 --> 00:19:51.019]  Alright, good talking to you.
[00:19:51.039 --> 00:19:52.620]  There goes my friend Raymond T. Good guy.
[00:19:53.141 --> 00:19:54.943]  Alright, I'm going to get him on something about NASA.
[00:19:55.263 --> 00:19:56.484]  Man, the stories he can tell you.
[00:19:56.884 --> 00:19:57.365]  Be right back.
[00:20:00.109 --> 00:20:05.335]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:20:05.475 --> 00:20:13.564]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:20:13.824 --> 00:20:20.892]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:20:21.052 --> 00:20:22.332]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:20:22.412 --> 00:20:28.313]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:33.594]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:20:33.694 --> 00:20:42.576]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[00:20:42.836 --> 00:20:46.137]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:20:57.861 --> 00:21:02.342]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:21:02.402 --> 00:21:06.504]  On May 1st, 2007, Gold Spot 674.50 and 1 ounce gold coins can be purchased for 696.15, 350.11 for half, and 175.06 for quarter ounce coins.
[00:21:06.544 --> 00:21:06.904]  That's 696.15, 350.11, and 175.06.
[00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:23.513]  There has been talk coming from the Council of Foreign Relations of forming an American Union combining Canada, Mexico, and the U.S.
[00:21:23.613 --> 00:21:25.014]  and erasing economic borders.
[00:21:25.214 --> 00:21:30.796]  Bush met with Vincent Fox, President of Mexico, or of Canada, discussing a security and prosperity partnership.
[00:21:30.976 --> 00:21:34.538]  The formation of the North American Union will have a great impact on the U.S.
[00:21:34.578 --> 00:21:35.098]  economy.
[00:21:35.338 --> 00:21:40.080]  Jerome R. Corsi published the document, The Plan to Replace the Dollar with the Emerald.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.721]  The sovereignty of the U.S.
[00:21:41.981 --> 00:21:42.681]  is under attack.
[00:21:43.161 --> 00:21:46.506]  And Corsi uncovers the secrets and lies that surround the deceit.
[00:21:46.786 --> 00:21:47.967]  Call for your copy today!
[00:21:47.987 --> 00:21:49.449]  800-686-2237 We the people must take a stand!
[00:21:49.509 --> 00:21:50.210]  That's 800-686-2237 That's 800-686-2237
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:28.060]  The disciples asked Jesus in my coming and the end of the world you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines disease and earthquakes in many places we are living in this time of Earth's history many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom but without the wisdom of God this is impossible second Peter says we have a more sure word of prophecy and you do well if you take heed but first know this that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:28.881]  We're good to go.
[00:22:57.466 --> 00:22:59.508]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:00.129 --> 00:23:09.078]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:09.518 --> 00:23:16.726]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:17.418 --> 00:23:22.923]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:34.252]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:35.013 --> 00:23:37.074]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:23:37.575 --> 00:23:38.976]  For more information, call 702-953-0111.
[00:23:41.578 --> 00:23:41.858]  We're good.
[00:24:04.102 --> 00:24:16.631]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:24:19.814 --> 00:24:22.115]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[00:24:22.696 --> 00:24:24.037]  Someone who cares.
[00:24:24.857 --> 00:24:27.419]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:24:34.062 --> 00:24:34.683]  Welcome back!
[00:24:35.783 --> 00:24:40.786]  We're going to have open phones throughout the show today.
[00:24:40.806 --> 00:24:50.112]  I'm going to air about 15 minutes from a Sky Television Fox propaganda piece that about a year and a half ago I was interviewed for.
[00:24:50.132 --> 00:24:51.813]  Never saw it.
[00:24:51.874 --> 00:24:53.935]  They never sent me a tape like they said they would.
[00:24:55.446 --> 00:25:03.969]  The host of the show, I think his name is Danny Archer, they did send me a tape of the Illuminati special they did where they interviewed me about Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove.
[00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:09.491]  And it was the same tactic in that piece that they used in this piece.
[00:25:09.951 --> 00:25:16.554]  So we will be playing that and going over some of the more shoddy forms of disinformation and propaganda.
[00:25:17.054 --> 00:25:19.615]  Because they never disputed any of our information.
[00:25:20.646 --> 00:25:23.168]  At the end, well, you'll see what they did.
[00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:29.271]  We're going to play that Keith Olbermann piece in its entirety because it's so amazing and important and informative and on target.
[00:25:30.172 --> 00:25:36.236]  We've got Red McGovern saying that the Yellow Cake forged documents from Niger to lead right back to Dick Cheney's office.
[00:25:37.376 --> 00:25:43.680]  We're also going to be taking your calls later in the second and third hour for first-time callers only.
[00:25:45.101 --> 00:25:49.604]  I want to give first-time callers, I get emails every day going, hey man, I've been trying to call into your show for six months.
[00:25:50.433 --> 00:25:52.214]  And I can never get in, and I'm a first-time caller.
[00:25:52.274 --> 00:25:52.614]  Okay?
[00:25:53.055 --> 00:25:57.678]  First-time callers in the second and third hour today, and we will be taking a lot of your phone calls.
[00:25:58.078 --> 00:26:00.139]  But we're not opening the phones up just yet.
[00:26:00.379 --> 00:26:02.521]  I do want to hear from you, but I've got a lot of news I want to cover.
[00:26:03.762 --> 00:26:11.967]  Let me get into some news I didn't get to yesterday, then we're going to come back and get into the big North American Union merger with the EU information that just came out.
[00:26:14.028 --> 00:26:18.131]  Not new info for this audience, but now admitted by the mainstream media, so we'll be covering it.
[00:26:19.176 --> 00:26:26.201]  Quite an announcement, quite a deal signed by Bush and Blair and Merkel and the rest of them.
[00:26:27.182 --> 00:26:33.125]  But before I do that, I thought I would get into this little piece of news.
[00:26:34.987 --> 00:26:40.150]  Cops admit to planting marijuana on 92-year-old woman killed in botched drug raid.
[00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.732]  Associated Press, this came out yesterday.
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:27:02.690]  Now, if you go back to a year ago when this happened, Eye on Air said, watch, it's going to be the wrong house, she's going to be hearing impaired, or deaf, as they say, and it's going to be a crime ridden area, and she would have fired on the men who weren't announced wearing black uniforms in the dark.
[00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.412]  And it turns out that's exactly what happened.
[00:27:07.412 --> 00:27:09.153]  We've seen this so many hundreds of times.
[00:27:10.874 --> 00:27:11.754]  It's the M.O.
[00:27:11.975 --> 00:27:12.515]  of the perps.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.361]  And they are perps.
[00:27:15.441 --> 00:27:16.742]  They are now going to be going to prison.
[00:27:16.762 --> 00:27:17.562]  They pled guilty.
[00:27:18.243 --> 00:27:22.305]  So after they gunned this woman down, they blew her all over the walls.
[00:27:22.365 --> 00:27:23.646]  I mean, they splattered her good.
[00:27:24.046 --> 00:27:25.867]  Shot her in the chest, the guts, the head.
[00:27:27.608 --> 00:27:30.850]  But I hope that's worth the prison time, boys, because you killed her good.
[00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:33.572]  She'd had her long life, though.
[00:27:33.592 --> 00:27:37.394]  You're not going to have a very good life now in prison as a cop.
[00:27:38.743 --> 00:27:45.046]  There's a tough guy, there's a wannabe military commando who kicks down old ladies doors.
[00:27:47.046 --> 00:28:05.514]  And you killed her, and then instead of just admitting you made a mistake, and instead of maybe losing your jobs or getting sued, you probably would have kept your job, saying it was an honest mistake, and apologizing and apologizing to the family, and griping out the informant, and sending him to prison that gave you the bad info.
[00:28:06.358 --> 00:28:11.102]  No, you planted marijuana on her, and you lied about her.
[00:28:11.663 --> 00:28:13.684]  And that's why you're going to prison now.
[00:28:16.107 --> 00:28:17.568]  And we see this over and over again.
[00:28:17.808 --> 00:28:19.930]  I'm wanting to find that tape, and I can't find it.
[00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.952]  I aired it many times back in, what, 1999?
[00:28:22.072 --> 00:28:24.634]  It was Midland, Texas.
[00:28:24.674 --> 00:28:27.176]  The SWAT team enters from two sides of the house.
[00:28:28.177 --> 00:28:31.740]  They shoot their own officers, killing one, wounding two others.
[00:28:32.894 --> 00:28:39.341]  And the fella that they did this to had a safe with some black powder unloaded collector's items.
[00:28:39.381 --> 00:28:40.582]  They were collector black powder.
[00:28:40.662 --> 00:28:49.231]  The guy was actually an anti-gunner, but he was a collector and he was collecting these black powder firearms, not even considered firearms.
[00:28:50.846 --> 00:28:53.808]  And they were, of course, locked in a safe, but that didn't matter.
[00:28:53.828 --> 00:28:59.972]  Now, you actually hear the cops crying on the tape, going, He's opened fire on us!
[00:29:00.252 --> 00:29:01.013]  APC!
[00:29:01.033 --> 00:29:05.275]  APC!
[00:29:05.956 --> 00:29:07.377]  And that wasn't enough for you.
[00:29:08.177 --> 00:29:09.538]  That's exactly what they did on the tape.
[00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:21.905]  They then had to frame this guy, and they were going to give him the death penalty until good officers that give police a good name said, no, actually, the SWAT team all shot themselves, and then they tried to frame the guy.
[00:29:22.125 --> 00:29:23.386]  Now, no one went to jail there.
[00:29:24.387 --> 00:29:24.907]  They should have.
[00:29:26.188 --> 00:29:29.430]  You killed a cop and injured two others with your mindlessness.
[00:29:30.671 --> 00:29:32.812]  But I'm going to finish up with this when we get back.
[00:29:33.624 --> 00:29:36.528]  And then we'll get into the North American Union merging with the EU.
[00:29:36.588 --> 00:29:41.473]  This is big, big, big, big news.
[00:29:41.934 --> 00:29:42.635]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:47.981]  We're on the march.
[00:29:48.442 --> 00:29:50.063]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:50.083 --> 00:29:53.688]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:56.827 --> 00:29:57.648]  Attention gardeners!
[00:29:57.728 --> 00:30:00.091]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:30:00.332 --> 00:30:04.657]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[00:30:04.857 --> 00:30:12.727]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:30:13.047 --> 00:30:15.889]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:30:16.169 --> 00:30:23.695]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:30:23.795 --> 00:30:29.399]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:30:29.619 --> 00:30:35.184]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:30:35.464 --> 00:30:38.786]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:30:39.026 --> 00:30:42.349]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:30:42.589 --> 00:30:47.631]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirk Chief Superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:30:47.651 --> 00:30:50.513]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:30:50.573 --> 00:30:50.753]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:30:56.676 --> 00:30:58.397]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:58.617 --> 00:31:02.318]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:31:02.638 --> 00:31:04.839]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[00:31:11.722 --> 00:31:16.544]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:31:16.824 --> 00:31:25.856]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:31:57.176 --> 00:32:08.185]  JLS Research, the makers of all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[00:32:08.385 --> 00:32:14.910]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:22.736]  By using organics and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[00:32:22.956 --> 00:32:23.657]  As it responds,
[00:32:23.917 --> 00:32:25.939]  Body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[00:32:26.239 --> 00:32:29.722]  First Responder is the first of its kind, comprised of only four organics.
[00:32:30.042 --> 00:32:33.305]  Grape seed skim, grape seed, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[00:32:33.666 --> 00:32:38.170]  It's so effective you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:40.972]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[00:32:41.272 --> 00:32:44.755]  Go online and order First Responder at no-bo.com.

[00:32:51.201 --> 00:32:51.421]  That's 850-723-8599.
[00:32:51.441 --> 00:32:52.582]  Alright, let me tell you how this works.
[00:33:13.254 --> 00:33:22.305]  Chase Manhattan, Citibank, Bank of America, the biggest banks in the country have been publicly caught hundreds of times laundering billions of dollars of drug money.
[00:33:22.345 --> 00:33:27.071]  The Federal Reserve, banks themselves, clearing houses have been caught doing it.
[00:33:27.091 --> 00:33:29.534]  It's been all over the news, buried in the back of the paper.
[00:33:29.854 --> 00:33:31.316]  Literally hundreds of times I've seen it.
[00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:35.811]  They ship in the narcotics and they license the drug cartels.
[00:33:35.831 --> 00:33:37.091]  I mean, they have large shipments.
[00:33:37.332 --> 00:33:49.635]  In fact, more than half, according to all the CIA experts and DEA experts we've interviewed and from all the past reports and the busts we've learned of, over half of the cocaine and heroin is shipped directly in by the U.S.
[00:33:49.655 --> 00:33:53.536]  government with above Delta Force operators protecting the shipments.
[00:33:54.576 --> 00:33:59.558]  Brought directly to your daughter when she's 16, so by the time she's 18 she'll be a prostitute on the streets.
[00:34:01.209 --> 00:34:02.531]  This is a great, wonderful system.
[00:34:02.631 --> 00:34:11.538]  Or then when your 17-year-old gets caught, or your 15-year-old gets caught with the heroin, they get to go to prison, then they get raped and get AIDS and hepatitis, and then your life's ruined.
[00:34:12.018 --> 00:34:13.659]  It's a very loving, loving government.
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.622]  We've got to search your car, the police say, to find the drugs.
[00:34:16.642 --> 00:34:17.883]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:34:18.579 --> 00:34:19.380]  I'm sick of it.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.841]  I don't use your filth, you understand?
[00:34:22.101 --> 00:34:30.507]  I don't use your Prozac and your Ritalin, and I don't use your heroin or your cocaine, or any of the garbage you try to cram down our throats with all the television ads.
[00:34:31.227 --> 00:34:35.670]  And yeah, don't think all those movies where they glorify drug use aren't television ads for it.
[00:34:36.851 --> 00:34:39.473]  There's nothing anti-establishment about drug use.
[00:34:39.593 --> 00:34:40.954]  Stop using it, Cole.
[00:34:41.014 --> 00:34:42.155]  You want to hurt the New World Order?
[00:34:42.195 --> 00:34:43.576]  Stop using it, young people.
[00:34:44.656 --> 00:34:45.597]  Don't ever try it.
[00:34:45.957 --> 00:34:47.158]  There's nothing cool about it.
[00:34:49.071 --> 00:34:52.434]  Nothing hurts the police state worse than not using their garbage.
[00:34:52.554 --> 00:34:53.755]  You see, they have the double tax.
[00:34:53.795 --> 00:34:58.738]  They ship it in, and then they tax you by making you a slave when they arrest you and put you into the system.
[00:34:58.939 --> 00:34:59.839]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:34:59.879 --> 00:35:03.862]  I always make that point because I'm trying to get it out there into the public consciousness.
[00:35:03.882 --> 00:35:06.184]  But I'm digressing.
[00:35:06.224 --> 00:35:08.225]  I said I'd get into the global system here in a minute.
[00:35:09.807 --> 00:35:10.507]  Let me go back here.
[00:35:11.568 --> 00:35:12.809]  So, they ship in the drugs.
[00:35:13.658 --> 00:35:19.200]  And then the rest of it, the 40 plus percent of it, is licensed drug cartels.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.660]  Licensed drug cartels.
[00:35:22.241 --> 00:35:40.906]  And that is, if they don't pay at least 25% in fees, 10% into the CIA and other federal agencies, and then another 15% or so in the laundering fee, instead of getting interest, they have to pay a large, they call it points, into the banks.
[00:35:42.808 --> 00:36:04.421]  And so what happens is, if you don't pay your cut, there are huge fleets of spray planes from Mexico down to the Shining Path boys there in Peru, and the aircraft take off and fly with GPS and spray your coca fields, your opium plantations, your marijuana cultivation belts,
[00:36:04.941 --> 00:36:14.234]  They spray those cartels and knock them out right next to the fields owned by the generals and the vice presidents and the premiers and the
[00:36:16.286 --> 00:36:26.210]  Prime Ministers of those countries, and they will fly, it's been in the news many times, with GPS spraying a field that's owned by another cartel right next to a cartel that pays their cut.
[00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:37.455]  If that doesn't work, if somebody like Noriega, who's been paying his cut, gets control of a whole country and stops paying it, there'll be an invasion when, you know, everybody wakes up on a Saturday morning and, oh, did you hear?
[00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:38.395]  There was an invasion.
[00:36:39.145 --> 00:36:40.586]  And they don't even really say why.
[00:36:40.666 --> 00:36:42.228]  It was to save some college students.
[00:36:42.248 --> 00:36:45.991]  Turns out that's fake, but that comes out a month later, and then no one cares.
[00:36:46.031 --> 00:36:49.894]  Hell, they stuck flags on their cars, and it felt good, and that's what mattered.
[00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:55.099]  So, that's the bottom line.
[00:36:55.199 --> 00:37:05.648]  Then, at the local level, where the rubber meets the road, you've got drug addicts, pieces of filth, informants, confidential informants,
[00:37:06.605 --> 00:37:11.429]  And, again, every week it's some insurance salesman or it's some family or it's people I know.
[00:37:11.449 --> 00:37:15.713]  I mean, it's just constantly happening here in Austin and all over the country.
[00:37:16.093 --> 00:37:18.535]  But, I mean, it happens every few months here locally to people I know.
[00:37:18.555 --> 00:37:21.097]  And it's 4 a.m.
[00:37:21.117 --> 00:37:31.186]  and you hear yelling and screaming and you wake up and your family's crying and your young children are running around and there's guys slamming your head down on the ground and they've got MP5s to your back and you're crying and you're going, what's going on?
[00:37:31.226 --> 00:37:32.767]  And they're tearing everything apart.
[00:37:33.613 --> 00:37:34.334]  Yes, I do.
[00:37:54.934 --> 00:37:55.834]  Why did they raid you?
[00:37:55.854 --> 00:38:04.676]  Well, the confidential drug addict informant who's got 15 arrests on his record and 5 convictions, or 6 convictions for everything under the sun, he gets a cut.
[00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:10.417]  And so, literally, these guys will want cocaine or heroin, and they'll just say, it's that house.
[00:38:12.158 --> 00:38:18.199]  Or they'll be bombed out of their head drunk, they're allowed to drunk drive, do whatever they want, that's all, you know, blind eyes turned to it.
[00:38:19.042 --> 00:38:26.539]  Because they're in the system, and they'll pull up with somebody buying cocaine, and it's a dark night, and it's duplexes, and they'll point out the wrong house.
[00:38:27.478 --> 00:38:32.162]  Or the SWAT teams, more often than not, will notice you're using more power than you should be.
[00:38:32.202 --> 00:38:36.526]  I know an old lady here in Austin got raided many years ago by the Travis County SWAT team.
[00:38:37.367 --> 00:38:41.511]  She's dead now, but she was a top expert in fish.
[00:38:41.571 --> 00:38:42.872]  I forget the technical term for that.
[00:38:43.513 --> 00:38:46.575]  She had many, many tanks in her house.
[00:38:46.816 --> 00:38:50.739]  It was just room after room of different saltwater and freshwater fish.
[00:38:50.799 --> 00:38:51.620]  It's what she liked.
[00:38:52.316 --> 00:38:58.879]  And they looked at her power bill and knew that it was on the record that only one person lived there and that she was using the power of ten people.
[00:38:59.679 --> 00:39:07.443]  And they, a SWAT team, raided her when she wasn't home and then just left a note on the door with the door open kicked down when they didn't find any drugs.
[00:39:07.843 --> 00:39:08.783]  Here's another example.
[00:39:09.504 --> 00:39:11.425]  I've got a friend named Nick.
[00:39:11.445 --> 00:39:15.126]  I guess they're married now, but this is before I even got a show.
[00:39:15.146 --> 00:39:16.347]  This was like 13 years ago.
[00:39:16.367 --> 00:39:18.588]  It was the Woodhollow Apartments.
[00:39:19.882 --> 00:39:20.522]  I don't think so.
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:48.885]  Nick actually went with me to film America Destroyed by Design for two weeks.
[00:39:48.945 --> 00:39:51.447]  So Nick's shooting the video you see in my first film.
[00:39:52.749 --> 00:39:59.936]  And about a year after I moved out of there, I'm kind of digressing here, but it doesn't matter.
[00:39:59.976 --> 00:40:06.603]  The point is, about a year after I moved out, I got a call and they told me, because I had just started the TV show then, and then later I used him for the film.
[00:40:08.132 --> 00:40:10.294]  And he goes, yeah man, a SWAT team raided us.
[00:40:10.375 --> 00:40:11.556]  And we found out what it was.
[00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:13.237]  The carpet cleaner.
[00:40:13.278 --> 00:40:16.221]  I've told this story where it happened to me too, but not with a drug raid.
[00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:18.883]  It was the guy wanted to call the cops because I had a shotgun in the case.
[00:40:19.564 --> 00:40:22.967]  And he'd seen TV and seen, you know, most of the shows are set in New York.
[00:40:23.248 --> 00:40:25.510]  The cop shows where people get arrested for having guns.
[00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.093]  Weak-minded public, they think guns are illegal in Texas.
[00:40:28.773 --> 00:40:34.995]  That's how scary it is, folks, because they watch TV, again, where in the cop shows, all the guns are banned.
[00:40:35.075 --> 00:40:36.235]  So then they see one in your house.
[00:40:36.335 --> 00:40:39.756]  But in this case, his girlfriend was going to UT as a botanist.
[00:40:40.497 --> 00:40:41.217]  And I remember this.
[00:40:41.257 --> 00:40:44.838]  I remember their whole back room was like a two-bedroom, but they slept in the same bed.
[00:40:45.138 --> 00:40:51.560]  But, you know, they had another bedroom with all these lights and, you know, orchids and irises growing.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.561]  And a two-year-old could tell these weren't marijuana plants.
[00:40:55.501 --> 00:40:57.602]  And the Snoopy
[00:40:59.944 --> 00:41:01.845]  By the way, Nick had a bad feeling when it happened.
[00:41:01.865 --> 00:41:04.166]  The guy started asking, what are these lights?
[00:41:04.186 --> 00:41:05.127]  What are these plants?
[00:41:05.447 --> 00:41:08.448]  Because they're all little deputies now here in the police state.
[00:41:09.249 --> 00:41:16.772]  And he said, well, you know, my girlfriend's taking botany at the University of Texas and that's her plants.
[00:41:17.853 --> 00:41:25.616]  And well, next day SWAT team comes, goes after him, kicks down the door, finds out it's plants and then cusses at him and leaves.
[00:41:26.137 --> 00:41:26.817]  That's America.
[00:41:27.774 --> 00:41:31.235]  You see, that's not land of the free, home of the brave, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:33.336 --> 00:41:49.982]  And now, I dipped it in the bud, because, and I told this, I'll tell it again, I probably told it ten times, but you need to know, I had the carpet cleaning place, the local, I'm not even going to say the name of the company, and I had them out to my house, and back then I had the studio in my house,
[00:41:51.711 --> 00:42:08.745]  And the guy is back in my office, and I walk in there while he's carpet cleaning, and him and his assistant, who was a white guy and a Hispanic guy, and the manager was talking about my shotgun up on a rack on the wall.
[00:42:09.285 --> 00:42:17.231]  I didn't have children at the time, I wasn't even married yet, so the gun was out in the open, up on the wall.
[00:42:17.591 --> 00:42:19.993]  I said case earlier, well it wasn't a case, it was just a gun rack.
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:27.263]  Just a basic $300 Winchester Defender.
[00:42:28.724 --> 00:42:31.185]  Six shot with the plug out, maybe seven shot with the plug out.
[00:42:32.305 --> 00:42:33.546]  And that's what I had.
[00:42:33.566 --> 00:42:36.147]  You come in my house, I'm going to grab that and I'm going to shoot you repeatedly.
[00:42:36.447 --> 00:42:37.668]  That's just how it's going to work.
[00:42:38.128 --> 00:42:40.429]  You're going to die if you break and enter my house.
[00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:45.392]  And they're having a discussion and the guy's going, yeah, is that legal?
[00:42:46.072 --> 00:42:46.612]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:42:46.672 --> 00:42:47.533]  And I said, excuse me?
[00:42:48.234 --> 00:42:50.536]  And I reached over to my desk and I said, you see me?
[00:42:50.916 --> 00:42:53.418]  Here I am in the paper at a gun rally.
[00:42:53.698 --> 00:42:55.520]  And we just had a rally like the weekend before.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.902]  And there I was in the paper and I said, you see me?
[00:42:58.982 --> 00:43:00.383]  I'm in the newspaper.
[00:43:01.224 --> 00:43:02.525]  Guns are legal here.
[00:43:02.865 --> 00:43:04.506]  I'm allowed to have that shotgun.
[00:43:05.047 --> 00:43:07.448]  And he's like, oh man, just know it's dangerous, please.
[00:43:08.429 --> 00:43:08.789]  All right.
[00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:10.671]  He mumbled something.
[00:43:11.071 --> 00:43:12.152]  And then they left.
[00:43:13.573 --> 00:43:14.774]  And I had a bad feeling.
[00:43:16.613 --> 00:43:18.214]  This happened on the TV show, by the way.
[00:43:18.234 --> 00:43:19.274]  I'm about to tell you.
[00:43:19.294 --> 00:43:20.675]  So it was about five o'clock.
[00:43:21.295 --> 00:43:22.416]  That had happened at about three.
[00:43:23.016 --> 00:43:26.178]  And I called and I said I want to talk to the manager.
[00:43:26.238 --> 00:43:28.019]  And the manager knew my name when he came on.
[00:43:28.059 --> 00:43:29.079]  He said, hello Mr. Jones.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.580]  Yes, it was handled.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:32.901]  Yes, he came back and he wanted to call the police.
[00:43:33.482 --> 00:43:34.622]  But we explained to him.
[00:43:34.722 --> 00:43:35.723]  Yes, we understand.
[00:43:35.743 --> 00:43:37.484]  No, we didn't call the police.
[00:43:38.324 --> 00:43:40.565]  Then I go on AXS TV that night.
[00:43:40.645 --> 00:43:41.866]  I had a TV show that night.
[00:43:41.906 --> 00:43:43.887]  It was a Wednesday night then when I was doing the show.
[00:43:44.984 --> 00:44:10.884]  and uh... the hispanic uh... assistant guy called into the show and said yes i was there they did call the police but then they called and and and and stop the police because the cops come up with some gun report even if it's a legal gun it's some kind of weird thing where they have to investigate and then the head the the head manager you know what i'll just say it stanley steamer carpet cleaner stanley steamer carpet cleaner
[00:44:12.034 --> 00:44:14.855]  The strange thing is, I worked there for a couple of months back in high school.
[00:44:15.095 --> 00:44:16.255]  God, they worked those people hard.
[00:44:16.295 --> 00:44:17.115]  I quit that job.
[00:44:17.736 --> 00:44:20.116]  I went in like 14 hours a day, and I mean, it was tough.
[00:44:20.136 --> 00:44:24.217]  These houses were full of dog poo and cat urine everywhere.
[00:44:24.297 --> 00:44:25.638]  Anyways, I'm getting off subject.
[00:44:28.159 --> 00:44:29.279]  People look like animals, folks.
[00:44:29.319 --> 00:44:29.899]  I'm here to tell you.
[00:44:30.939 --> 00:44:34.340]  But see, it's perfect spies inside the house.
[00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:35.361]  Why not?
[00:44:35.401 --> 00:44:36.541]  Why not just say the name of the company?
[00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:41.431]  And then his assistant called in and said, yeah, that guy's an idiot.
[00:44:41.471 --> 00:44:44.011]  As soon as he got in the car, he said he was going to call the cops on that guy.
[00:44:44.071 --> 00:44:44.831]  Guns are illegal.
[00:44:45.351 --> 00:44:52.513]  The Hispanic fellow who had his head screwed on straight and was a Texan, this other guy wasn't from Texas, explained that guns were legal and that he had a gun.
[00:44:52.533 --> 00:44:53.893]  It didn't matter, folks.
[00:44:53.933 --> 00:44:59.054]  I had the police called on me in America because of Stanley Steamer Carpet Cleaner.
[00:44:59.554 --> 00:45:01.074]  Well, because of their idiot employee.
[00:45:02.735 --> 00:45:04.355]  Now, thank God,
[00:45:05.939 --> 00:45:09.601]  That the manager had a brain and thank God that the assistant had a brain.
[00:45:09.641 --> 00:45:10.922]  Oh, by the way, I forgot.
[00:45:10.962 --> 00:45:19.106]  They fired the assistant that day because he argued with them and made a big deal out of it after they called the cops.
[00:45:19.626 --> 00:45:20.547]  I'd forgotten that part.
[00:45:21.167 --> 00:45:23.328]  And that I didn't know.
[00:45:23.388 --> 00:45:24.549]  He never said anything in my house.
[00:45:24.869 --> 00:45:26.230]  He was a fan of the TV show.
[00:45:27.271 --> 00:45:27.991]  I forgot that part.
[00:45:29.221 --> 00:45:38.287]  So imagine, in your house folks, you've got some old 1887 revolver put out by Colt, framed.
[00:45:39.248 --> 00:45:43.230]  Folks, repairmen, all of them, a lot of them think it's illegal.
[00:45:43.991 --> 00:45:50.255]  Folks that moved here from New York, L.A., places like that, Chicago, they think it's illegal.
[00:45:50.655 --> 00:45:54.698]  You've got a big pretty gun case in your hall with granddaddy's shotgun in it.
[00:45:56.645 --> 00:45:57.826]  I used to have that, folks.
[00:45:58.186 --> 00:46:00.326]  Now I got it in a big, locked safe.
[00:46:01.727 --> 00:46:06.008]  You know, with a big ol' spin handle, uh, control key entrance.
[00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:09.129]  Chained and bolted and drilled into the wall.
[00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:22.794]  Because, and I've got my guns in instant access pistol safes, and even before I had children I went to that because I realized I wasn't living in a free country anymore because the public was a bunch of brainwashed scum.
[00:46:25.362 --> 00:46:26.523]  You got fish tanks.
[00:46:27.845 --> 00:46:28.826]  You got orchids.
[00:46:30.007 --> 00:46:31.248]  You got a gun in a case.
[00:46:31.649 --> 00:46:32.730]  The SWAT teams are coming.
[00:46:33.591 --> 00:46:34.171]  You understand?
[00:46:34.672 --> 00:46:35.673]  And they do it all day.
[00:46:36.233 --> 00:46:39.096]  And if they shoot their own officer in the back, they're going to frame you for it.
[00:46:39.817 --> 00:46:41.939]  Or they shoot an old lady, they're going to frame you for it.
[00:46:41.979 --> 00:46:43.461]  Or they're going to frame her dead body for it.
[00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:49.073]  And because they've decided, well, since we're the good guys, we've got to protect ourselves.
[00:46:49.093 --> 00:46:50.274]  We've got to do whatever it takes.
[00:46:50.875 --> 00:46:52.236]  And so we'll cut a few corners.
[00:46:52.656 --> 00:46:55.599]  And as soon as you start cutting corners, you drop straight into hell.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:57.521]  So here it is.
[00:46:57.621 --> 00:47:04.626]  Cops admit to planting marijuana on 92-year-old woman killed in botched drug raid, Associated Press.
[00:47:05.026 --> 00:47:14.313]  Two police officers pled guilty Thursday to manslaughter in the shooting death of a 92-year-old woman during a botched drug raid last fall.
[00:47:14.673 --> 00:47:17.135]  A third officer still faces charges.
[00:47:17.815 --> 00:47:18.556]  Officer J.R.
[00:47:18.616 --> 00:47:22.298]  Smith told a state judge Thursday that he regretted what had happened.
[00:47:22.699 --> 00:47:25.861]  I bet you do, because the most you'd have done is lost your job if you'd have told the truth.
[00:47:26.588 --> 00:47:28.149]  Always tell the truth.
[00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:31.291]  You should have just kept your mouth shut!
[00:47:31.571 --> 00:47:32.572]  You got a Fifth Amendment.
[00:47:33.452 --> 00:47:34.813]  No, you had to lie.
[00:47:34.833 --> 00:47:38.135]  And I'm just telling the public, keep your mouth shut.
[00:47:40.516 --> 00:47:42.938]  And I'm not even trying to tell the cops how to get out of killing innocent people.
[00:47:42.958 --> 00:47:45.839]  It's just, I'm telling my listeners, learn to shut your mouths.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.942]  I'm sorry the 35-year-old said his voice barely audible.
[00:47:52.063 --> 00:47:54.004]  That's right, because you're not going to have a good time in prison.
[00:47:54.585 --> 00:48:02.529]  He pled guilty to manslaughter, violation of oath, criminal solicitation, making false statements and perjury, which was based on claims in a warrant.
[00:48:02.929 --> 00:48:05.050]  Now he's probably only going to get a year or something.
[00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:07.192]  The guys that are still lying, he's ratting out?
[00:48:09.493 --> 00:48:10.053]  Decades.
[00:48:11.454 --> 00:48:20.138]  Former officer Greg Junner, 40, who retired from the Atlanta police in January, pled guilty to manslaughter, violation of oath, criminal solicitation, and making false statements.
[00:48:20.178 --> 00:48:23.600]  Both men are expected to face more than 10 years in prison.
[00:48:25.692 --> 00:48:27.494]  And that will not be fun years in prison.
[00:48:29.436 --> 00:48:37.125]  It'd probably be fun to be in the... I mean, of course it'd be a nightmare, but compared to solitary confinement for their safety, it'd be fun to be in general population.
[00:48:38.607 --> 00:48:44.773]  At least fighting and... I think that'd be better than being in solitary.
[00:48:48.166 --> 00:48:52.787]  In a hearing later in federal court, both pled guilty to a single charge of conspiracy.
[00:48:52.867 --> 00:48:53.687]  Oh, that's impossible.
[00:48:53.707 --> 00:48:54.608]  Conspiracy doesn't exist.
[00:48:54.968 --> 00:49:00.809]  To violate a person's civil rights, resulting in death, their state and federal sentences would run concurrently.
[00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:03.010]  It was a no-knock drug raid.
[00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.710]  They didn't tell her.
[00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:05.770]  The woman was basically deaf.
[00:49:05.951 --> 00:49:07.011]  She had little or no hearing.
[00:49:08.251 --> 00:49:11.492]  And she was 92-year-old Catherine Johnston.
[00:49:12.962 --> 00:49:18.867]  And the informant described buying drugs from a dealer there, police said, when the officers burst in without warning.
[00:49:19.448 --> 00:49:22.470]  Johnston fired at them and they fired back, killing her.
[00:49:23.131 --> 00:49:24.832]  By the way, she did shoot a couple of them.
[00:49:27.495 --> 00:49:35.962]  Fulton County Prosecutor Peter Johnston said the officers involved in Johnston's death fired 39 shots, striking her five or six times, including a fatal blow to the chest.
[00:49:37.083 --> 00:49:39.325]  He said Johnston fired only once through the door.
[00:49:41.152 --> 00:49:41.472]  You know what?
[00:49:41.552 --> 00:49:43.954]  I was going from their lies earlier, and I could go pull the article.
[00:49:43.994 --> 00:49:46.355]  See, I hadn't even read this whole article yet when I went on air with it.
[00:49:46.535 --> 00:49:48.957]  I read the first few paragraphs yesterday.
[00:49:49.757 --> 00:49:51.938]  That's right, they claim she shot them at first.
[00:49:52.138 --> 00:49:52.619]  That's right.
[00:49:52.779 --> 00:49:54.160]  See, and I was going off the earlier lie.
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.080]  I guess that's a lie too.
[00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:58.722]  God, I don't remember if it was claimed she shot an officer.
[00:49:58.742 --> 00:49:59.863]  I ought to go pull that.
[00:49:59.883 --> 00:50:00.843]  We ought to do an article about that.
[00:50:00.863 --> 00:50:01.844]  That's not being pointed out.
[00:50:02.164 --> 00:50:03.205]  Maybe it is later in the story.
[00:50:03.245 --> 00:50:04.025]  It's a long article.
[00:50:05.106 --> 00:50:07.307]  But yeah, they claim she also shot them, so I guess she didn't.
[00:50:07.667 --> 00:50:08.748]  They claim she shot two of them.
[00:50:12.074 --> 00:50:15.397]  He said Johnson fired only once through the door and didn't hit any of the officers.
[00:50:15.737 --> 00:50:19.721]  That means the officers who were wounded likely were hit by their other colleagues.
[00:50:19.821 --> 00:50:20.902]  Oh, I hadn't read the next line.
[00:50:21.682 --> 00:50:24.885]  That's the problem with not reading your own reading story.
[00:50:26.747 --> 00:50:32.952]  But, um... Yeah, I have a tendency to read only the first page, so there you go.
[00:50:35.134 --> 00:50:39.438]  I'd remembered they'd been shot, so... Alright, we will
[00:50:40.422 --> 00:50:45.227]  Come back and I will start getting into the whole North American Union story, now merging with the EU publicly.
[00:50:46.128 --> 00:50:51.253]  And then we'll get into some audio clips and then your phone calls in the second hour for first-time callers.
[00:50:51.273 --> 00:50:52.414]  But the phones aren't open yet.
[00:50:52.654 --> 00:50:53.535]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:59.984 --> 00:51:00.445]  It's here.
[00:51:00.665 --> 00:51:05.430]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:05.811 --> 00:51:13.439]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:14.136 --> 00:51:21.179]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:21.599 --> 00:51:33.024]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:33.324 --> 00:51:36.766]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:37.286 --> 00:51:39.247]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:39.547 --> 00:51:43.389]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:00.663 --> 00:53:04.066]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:53:04.246 --> 00:53:07.749]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:53:07.989 --> 00:53:11.192]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:53:11.212 --> 00:53:16.736]  This basic candidate of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:53:16.756 --> 00:53:21.981]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[00:53:22.381 --> 00:53:23.081]  We're good to go!

[00:54:06.701 --> 00:54:12.667]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[00:54:12.807 --> 00:54:15.970]  But nobody wants to know him.
[00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:18.692]  They can see that he's just a fool.
[00:54:29.559 --> 00:54:36.784]  I want to take my time going over the North American Union-EU merger news in the BBC.
[00:54:38.166 --> 00:54:48.534]  So in this segment I've been wanting to talk about this the last few weeks that I have and I just want to briefly say that I love life, I am thankful for everything that God has given me in life and that
[00:54:50.367 --> 00:54:52.589]  Sometimes the show may sound a little bit negative.
[00:54:53.970 --> 00:55:02.817]  That's because we're focusing on the bad things in the world so that good people can be rallied to become aware of it and then to resist it.
[00:55:03.637 --> 00:55:13.705]  As the Founding Fathers and Lord Acton and many others said in different ways, that all that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[00:55:14.446 --> 00:55:17.488]  Or that all that evil needs to triumph is that good people
[00:55:18.314 --> 00:55:19.094]  Do nothing?
[00:55:19.434 --> 00:55:20.915]  Or that good men and women do nothing?
[00:55:22.896 --> 00:55:32.599]  I mean, think about the incredible mystery of the universe and the beauty of the oceans and lakes and trees and plants and animals.
[00:55:33.319 --> 00:55:44.783]  And as I've said, watching ants just crawl around on the grass on the ground or, you know, children laughing and the discovery and the mystery in their eyes.
[00:55:45.738 --> 00:55:51.526]  And you know, the electric spark of creativity and discovery.
[00:55:53.449 --> 00:56:03.102]  When you look up at the heavens at night, you look at millions of stars with planets orbiting them and all the different asteroids' belts and the Kuiper belt.
[00:56:06.314 --> 00:56:15.517]  Think about it, and just how wonderful it is to be alive, and to have love, and to have friends, and to have family, and to share experiences with friends.
[00:56:16.677 --> 00:56:23.659]  And instead, so many people are frustrated, they're decadent, they're unhappy, more, more, more, they want all these trinkets and baubles.
[00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:32.062]  I was at a friend's house in Los Angeles, and on the shelf they had a big iron ore meteorite, iron nickel meteorite,
[00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:44.516]  And I'd always, you know, had kind of a romantic idea of space and meteorites, and my dad had told me about how he'd found a meteorite when he was a kid, and how he always wanted to find another little meteorite.
[00:56:44.716 --> 00:56:45.736]  And so I said, where'd you get that?
[00:56:45.756 --> 00:56:47.017]  He said, oh, a store down the street.
[00:56:47.037 --> 00:56:49.879]  So we went to the store, and I bought a couple meteorites.
[00:56:49.899 --> 00:56:50.899]  They were really inexpensive, $20, $60.
[00:56:51.059 --> 00:56:54.201]  And I've got one in my hand.
[00:56:54.241 --> 00:57:00.164]  It's a stone meteorite, and it looks like the classic, you know, archetypal
[00:57:02.264 --> 00:57:26.125]  The image of a meteor, kind of cylindrical with the potholes all over it, where different particles burnt out, different pieces popped out when it came into the atmosphere, when the meteor became a meteorite, and just a hole in your hand, again I'm not into possessions, it's not that it's some
[00:57:26.986 --> 00:57:55.203]  thing of value to me it's that it's interesting and it has a timelessness and an outside this world feeling to it and just to hold it and to smell it, to smell uh... the uh... because it's mainly a stone meteorite but it has some iron ore in it to smell the iron and to think about how old it is but then really to know we're standing on a giant meteor we're standing on a huge satellite we're standing on a
[00:57:56.323 --> 00:58:10.989]  What, 14,000 mile circumference spaceship, spinning, hurtling at tens of thousands of miles an hour around a standard yellow dwarf sun, two-thirds of the way out of a spiral arm of a Milky Way galaxy.
[00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:20.813]  Out on the edge of the galaxy clusters, looking in towards the galactic core, the universe is literally all around us.
[00:58:20.853 --> 00:58:22.634]  We are in it and of it.
[00:58:24.254 --> 00:58:25.995]  The incredible mysteries of all of it.
[00:58:27.137 --> 00:58:35.062]  Meanwhile, women are wanting collagen injections of melted down dead Chinese babies so they can look good.

[00:58:59.268 --> 00:59:00.189]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:04.811]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:05.031 --> 00:59:09.133]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:10.813 --> 00:59:22.419]  Coming to you from Austin, Texas, here on Spaceship Earth, I am Alex Jones, attempting to mobilize the human population against an aberrant
[00:59:23.371 --> 00:59:38.319]  Aberrant substrain of our own species who has set up predatory operations against the free humanity that is struggling to resist being inducted into a high-tech enslavement extermination grid.
[00:59:38.339 --> 00:59:41.640]  We're going to have open phones later in the hour.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:45.522]  We've got tons of news and information that we're going to be covering.
[00:59:47.883 --> 00:59:50.965]  But there has been really a gigantic development
[00:59:52.640 --> 01:00:12.179]  concerning the North American Union and the American Union's merger and I am, what I'm going to do is when I start the next segment, so I have plenty of time to go over this, I'm going to get into it because we'll make an audio file out of it and post it on the web and I hope you will distribute it out there to everyone.
[01:00:12.239 --> 01:00:13.721]  It really is up to you.
[01:00:14.441 --> 01:00:16.984]  The power to lay waste to the New World Orders
[01:00:19.441 --> 01:00:44.061]  system to its juggernaut to its titanic apparatchik is in your hands you have the unlimited power to defeat the new world order in your heart in your soul as Gandhi said the seed of the universe is in each and every one of us and I agree with that statement wholeheartedly and I hope you will access that
[01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:51.880]  Not just the race consciousness of Homo Sapien Sapien and the innate drive of survival of the species.
[01:00:52.791 --> 01:01:17.339]  But something even more tapping in, ladies and gentlemen, to the Spirit of God that energizes all energy and life in the cosmos in this dimension and in all dimensions throughout eternity and through all eternities in its fractal explosive paradigm of unlimited potential.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.981]  But when we get back, I will
[01:01:23.727 --> 01:01:42.379]  Get into what's happening here at the microscopic level on this planet in the petty affairs of the petty demagogues and the wicked that revel in darkness.
[01:01:46.463 --> 01:01:57.351]  We will go over just absolutely ultra-massive developments that are mind-blowing and that's why I'm holding back even covering it because I'm trying to write notes during the breaks to properly cover this.
[01:01:58.232 --> 01:02:02.796]  I'm trying to control myself because I'm so infuriated by this open announcement.
[01:02:03.196 --> 01:02:11.683]  The gauntlet not being thrown down at our feet, but taking their gauntleted fist and smashing it right into our nose.
[01:02:14.725 --> 01:02:16.066]  So we'll be going over that
[01:02:18.237 --> 01:02:25.105]  And then coming up, I never got to this yesterday, we are going to air the eyewitness inside WTC7 reported explosions before it collapsed.
[01:02:25.465 --> 01:02:27.748]  I'm going to re-air that Keith Ullman that we haven't aired in its entirety.
[01:02:27.788 --> 01:02:28.569]  Extremely powerful.
[01:02:28.969 --> 01:02:36.618]  There was a Fox Sky television hit piece that I want to break down on 9-11 where they attacked me and others and basically analyze it.
[01:02:41.678 --> 01:02:43.459]  Immigration rallies planned nationwide.
[01:02:43.499 --> 01:02:49.401]  Of course, your calls, I promise, but I'm going to try in one segment to lay out what's happened when we get back.
[01:02:51.562 --> 01:02:55.224]  EU and US agree on single market.
[01:02:55.864 --> 01:03:05.068]  The United States and the European Union have signed up to a new transatlantic economic partnership at a summit in Washington.
[01:03:06.688 --> 01:03:07.669]  So we're going to cover this
[01:03:09.716 --> 01:03:18.899]  When we get back, and then we will take a bunch of calls, first-time callers, and then I will get into all the other news and clips we've got coming up today.
[01:03:19.399 --> 01:03:24.660]  The toll-free number to join us for first-time callers, we'll start taking your calls at 24 after, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:24.760]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:24.781 --> 01:03:26.201]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:03:37.762 --> 01:03:44.104]  We are the organic response to a threat to the continued freedom and viability of the species.
[01:03:44.644 --> 01:03:47.204]  The destiny of humanity is in the balance.
[01:03:48.665 --> 01:03:57.027]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:57.387 --> 01:04:05.009]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:12.783]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:24.608]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:24.908 --> 01:04:28.370]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:30.831]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:31.151 --> 01:04:34.993]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:49.081]  Terrorism.
[01:04:49.241 --> 01:04:49.981]  Terrorism.
[01:04:50.101 --> 01:04:56.165]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:58.026]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:04:58.266 --> 01:05:00.727]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:01.127 --> 01:05:15.696]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:15.736 --> 01:05:16.036]  government.
[01:05:16.236 --> 01:05:18.017]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:18.397 --> 01:05:24.320]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:28.942]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[01:05:48.228 --> 01:05:49.969]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:05:50.109 --> 01:05:51.430]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:54.432]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:05:54.792 --> 01:05:57.554]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:05:58.094 --> 01:06:04.838]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:37.686]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:37.746 --> 01:06:39.187]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:06:59.189 --> 01:07:13.857]  Well... The sovereign nations of the planet are dying.
[01:07:13.937 --> 01:07:15.178]  They're being phased out.
[01:07:22.336 --> 01:07:30.240]  And their deaths are not accompanied by a big explosion or a bang, as they say, but with a whimper.
[01:07:32.801 --> 01:07:48.209]  And Mr. Pasteur of the Council on Foreign Relations report that was passed into executive fiat law in March of 2005 has said, we are having a North American Union by stealth.
[01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:51.171]  By stealth integration.
[01:07:52.882 --> 01:07:55.907]  New World Order will be born in pieces.
[01:07:58.611 --> 01:07:59.692]  It will evolve.
[01:07:59.712 --> 01:08:03.718]  The European Union started in 1949 with the Treaty of London.
[01:08:06.227 --> 01:08:13.609]  Then, in 1954, the Bilderberg Group met and codified it into a steel trade tariff deal.
[01:08:14.049 --> 01:08:19.911]  In 1947, they then had the Treaty of Rome, when it was officially born as the European Economic Community.
[01:08:20.251 --> 01:08:35.556]  It had several other names, and then, by the mid-1990s, they publicly announced to the first 10-member, now 15-plus member, European Union system that it indeed would be a union, a governmental
[01:08:37.873 --> 01:08:38.553]  Conglomerate.
[01:08:40.434 --> 01:08:45.556]  And that voting rights and individual liberties of the nations and their currencies would be removed.
[01:08:45.636 --> 01:08:46.997]  They have been removed.
[01:08:47.737 --> 01:09:00.422]  To further sell the public on this, we predicted and told you, because it wasn't hard, it was in CFR and UN and IMF and Davos, Switzerland documents, that they would then make the Euro for a time
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:25.249]  The preeminent currency to then sell the world, the Asian Union and the North American Union, into publicly announcing themselves to then set up three global currencies to then be merged by stealth and EU, Euroized, Dollarized, or under an Asian name, merged into three systems.
[01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:27.630]  Let me try to explain this.
[01:09:29.668 --> 01:09:32.128]  They don't tell the Europeans it's the European Union.
[01:09:32.148 --> 01:09:41.430]  They tell them it's a trade deal, a trade deal, a trade deal, a trade deal to make money and to smooth out commerce and for Europe to work together to be more competitive globally.
[01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:45.871]  And that it's what all the smartest and coolest people are for.
[01:09:46.791 --> 01:09:48.971]  And, oh, it's going to make milk and honey flow in the streets.
[01:09:49.811 --> 01:09:55.892]  But, by the way, you're not allowed to vote on it as nations, just your presidents and prime ministers.
[01:09:56.233 --> 01:09:58.733]  They're going to sign on, which they did via treaties.
[01:10:01.170 --> 01:10:11.156]  And then finally they stopped calling everyone that was claiming they were setting up a European Union conspiracy theorist, and by the mid-nineties they said, okay, it is a Euro, we're going to do it, it's going to happen.
[01:10:14.117 --> 01:10:24.783]  And then the people found out that it meant more taxes, more regulations, less freedom, more controls, and in major polls, upwards of 85 to 90 percent
[01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:30.111]  And it was just 70-something percent five, six years ago were against it.
[01:10:30.431 --> 01:10:34.272]  Now it's in the mid-80s to low-90s are against the European Union.
[01:10:34.652 --> 01:10:36.353]  They just had the 50th anniversary.
[01:10:36.373 --> 01:10:54.059]  Again, it didn't exist until 2000, but they just had a 50th anniversary of the European Union three weeks ago, and it showed celebrations in all the major cities on Yahoo, Reuters, and AP Photos, and literally they had millions of dollars per city and jugglers and parades, and no one showed up.
[01:10:54.599 --> 01:10:55.759]  We're good to go.
[01:11:19.551 --> 01:11:35.684]  So they shut it up, they merged the police, they merged the military, they merged the regulations, they merged the bureaucracies, then the people lost their power to elect representatives, because that had already been advocated, handed over,
[01:11:36.404 --> 01:11:36.845]  We're good to go.
[01:11:52.961 --> 01:12:07.825]  With Canada, the United States, and Mexico as the first unit of the Pan-American Union, being the North American Union, and then to be expanded into GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to all of the Caribbean and then the Pacific.
[01:12:09.906 --> 01:12:19.709]  So again, you can go read what the Trilateralists said they would do when they founded the Trilateral Commission in 1973, Jimmy Carter, David Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[01:12:20.328 --> 01:12:21.609]  And they said, we will form.
[01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:23.190]  This is how I knew this.
[01:12:23.911 --> 01:12:25.492]  I actually go off what they say.
[01:12:25.792 --> 01:12:29.094]  People keep emailing me saying, I'm a genius, oh my god, everything you say happens.
[01:12:30.215 --> 01:12:31.656]  Because David Rockefeller said so.
[01:12:31.676 --> 01:12:33.657]  Because Henry Kissinger said so.
[01:12:33.677 --> 01:12:35.298]  Because Club of Rome said so.
[01:12:35.318 --> 01:12:36.820]  Because the EU said so.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.681]  Because NAFTA and GATT said so.
[01:12:38.901 --> 01:12:41.022]  Because the SPP said so.
[01:12:41.543 --> 01:12:42.503]  This is not hard.
[01:12:42.724 --> 01:12:46.006]  This is reading the documents, reading the treaties, okay?
[01:12:50.023 --> 01:12:56.705]  And not listening to the Tokyo Rose media telling you it doesn't exist, you're nuts, it's code word for racism.
[01:12:57.405 --> 01:12:59.225]  Literally, they say, oh, you're against the North American Union?
[01:12:59.486 --> 01:13:00.906]  Oh, that's code for racism.
[01:13:01.086 --> 01:13:01.966]  It has nothing to do with it.
[01:13:01.986 --> 01:13:09.008]  It's like when I caught black guys being bribed, being paid the money to give false testimony in 2000 here at the Texas Legislature.
[01:13:09.628 --> 01:13:12.529]  The newspaper called me and said, are you racist?
[01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:15.090]  Would you have put this up on your website if they'd been white?
[01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:16.430]  And I said, excuse me?
[01:13:17.199 --> 01:13:21.742]  See, this is the new Sovietism, the mind control, the political correctness.
[01:13:22.442 --> 01:13:26.565]  You say you don't want arsenic in your water, and they call up and ask if you're a member of the Aryan Nations.
[01:13:26.845 --> 01:13:32.048]  Has nothing to do with it, but it's to let the public know, hey, you don't want to be blackballed, do you?
[01:13:32.188 --> 01:13:33.329]  Then don't talk about this.
[01:13:33.889 --> 01:13:39.772]  By the way, government ministers have been arrested and fired in the EU for calling it tyrannical.
[01:13:39.952 --> 01:13:44.175]  They've said that that is xenophobic towards Europe, now criticizing the government.
[01:13:45.043 --> 01:13:45.883]  You get arrested.
[01:13:46.123 --> 01:13:48.284]  Do you understand?
[01:13:48.544 --> 01:13:51.986]  Now they want to arrest you for denying man-made global warming.
[01:13:52.026 --> 01:13:54.086]  They say it's like Holocaust denial.
[01:13:54.266 --> 01:13:55.467]  They're trying to pass laws.
[01:13:55.507 --> 01:13:59.308]  See, it starts with something like Holocaust denial, then it expands out.
[01:13:59.908 --> 01:14:00.969]  I know you think I'm kidding.
[01:14:01.009 --> 01:14:01.949]  This sounds too crazy.
[01:14:01.989 --> 01:14:02.629]  Go look it up.
[01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:05.490]  Type in the keywords, the statements I made.
[01:14:06.211 --> 01:14:09.752]  Everything I'm saying is off headlines, so you can backtrack it and prove it.
[01:14:12.967 --> 01:14:20.974]  Okay, so by stealth, they claim it's a trade deal, they set up the European Union, then they remove people's liberties and freedoms where they can't even vote themselves out of it.
[01:14:22.376 --> 01:14:30.163]  When they tried to finally let the people have a semi-vote, they did vote against EU expansion into Turkey and other areas, but the governments don't care.
[01:14:30.343 --> 01:14:32.845]  They're still just signing treaties and doing it regardless.
[01:14:34.287 --> 01:14:38.531]  Just like 99% of Americans in major polls by CNN
[01:14:39.648 --> 01:14:40.588]  They had several polls.
[01:14:40.608 --> 01:14:44.229]  99% both times are against the North American Union.
[01:14:44.549 --> 01:14:45.129]  It doesn't matter.
[01:14:45.149 --> 01:14:49.430]  They just go forward with it and then say it doesn't exist while their public documents say it does.
[01:14:50.811 --> 01:15:01.914]  We played Pastor of the CFR who wrote the North American Community document that was written into international treaty in March of 2005 with Bush, Vicente Fox, and Paul Martin.
[01:15:02.294 --> 01:15:07.215]  And he says before the Congress, we're going to have one border with Mexico and Canada, a continental security perimeter.
[01:15:07.873 --> 01:15:09.153]  How many years have we told you that?
[01:15:09.373 --> 01:15:10.734]  Because that's in the documents.
[01:15:11.034 --> 01:15:13.715]  That was written in the fifties by the United Nations.
[01:15:14.655 --> 01:15:16.656]  It was written in the seventies by the Trilateralist.
[01:15:19.517 --> 01:15:23.018]  So what they do is, they create by stealth a European Union.
[01:15:23.998 --> 01:15:25.738]  It has to be the first to be announced.
[01:15:26.159 --> 01:15:28.619]  Once they had it set up, the people no longer had a vote.
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.500]  They no longer controlled it.
[01:15:32.643 --> 01:15:41.666]  It was all just the appointees by the Prime Ministers and Presidents and Premiers to the Council, and then you can remove that politician.
[01:15:41.686 --> 01:15:45.407]  It doesn't matter, because still, whoever gets appointed next, they're all controlled.
[01:15:45.667 --> 01:15:49.188]  We'll do the same thing, whether it's Romano Prodi or... It doesn't matter.
[01:15:50.668 --> 01:15:52.228]  So you have the European Union.
[01:15:54.009 --> 01:15:57.610]  You have the American Union, already in full force
[01:15:58.656 --> 01:16:02.838]  In March of 2005, two plus years in now, it was already set up a skeletal.
[01:16:02.898 --> 01:16:07.240]  Now they put the flesh and the organs and the skin and the hair and the teeth on it.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.561]  And they even put it in a nice business suit.
[01:16:09.761 --> 01:16:10.442]  It's built now.
[01:16:10.882 --> 01:16:12.462]  Now they're just expanding their hegemon.
[01:16:13.743 --> 01:16:20.446]  Then they, then notice they had the big partnership of Asian economies and countries.
[01:16:20.786 --> 01:16:24.408]  Now they, three months ago, announced the Asian Union.
[01:16:25.313 --> 01:16:28.977]  And they said, well, we've really been in the Asian Union for 10 years, but now we're announcing it.
[01:16:29.658 --> 01:16:40.971]  Then, they already had simultaneous deals under treaty, merging those three countries, those three mega-masses, those three super-states together.
[01:16:44.214 --> 01:16:44.515]  Okay?
[01:16:46.059 --> 01:16:50.704]  And then it all goes under international regulatory law that's written by the corporations.
[01:16:50.965 --> 01:16:58.713]  You see, people say, OK, well, the next move, we had agrarian societies, then we had city-states, then we had nations and empires, and now we have global government.
[01:16:58.933 --> 01:16:59.674]  That's the next step.
[01:16:59.974 --> 01:17:06.001]  Well, let's say that was the next step, which I'm not for ever having one central system that's designed for fraud and tyranny and oppression.
[01:17:07.444 --> 01:17:10.305]  But let's just say that's the next step.
[01:17:10.745 --> 01:17:14.847]  You know, Federation Earth, why you saw it on Star Trek, that's just the way, you know, it's going to happen.
[01:17:15.167 --> 01:17:15.887]  It must be true.
[01:17:17.228 --> 01:17:21.169]  Under this new system, there's no due process, no liberty, no freedom, no real redress.
[01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:23.790]  That's why they want global government.
[01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:27.092]  They already own the planet's resources almost completely.
[01:17:27.612 --> 01:17:36.035]  But they want a global government so that they can rewrite the world's laws to oppress and control and dominate and set up a tyranny.
[01:17:36.713 --> 01:17:39.496]  You see, when you set something new up, you get to build it in your image.
[01:17:41.358 --> 01:17:51.869]  So now they're merging the North American Union, the Asian Union, and the European Union, and the people of Asia and the people of North America don't even know that this is happening.
[01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:54.692]  But it did come out in the BBC today.
[01:17:55.213 --> 01:17:55.713]  They met.
[01:17:56.814 --> 01:17:59.257]  US and EU agree single market.
[01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:06.294]  The United States and the European Union have signed up to a new transatlantic economic partnership at a summit in Washington.
[01:18:06.814 --> 01:18:15.179]  The pact is designed to boost trade and investment by harmonizing regulatory standards, laying the basis for a US-EU single market.
[01:18:15.794 --> 01:18:20.476]  Now remember, in the last six years you keep hearing what four different members of the Supreme Court say.
[01:18:20.557 --> 01:18:22.538]  They now follow the orders of the World Court.
[01:18:23.338 --> 01:18:26.279]  No longer is the Supreme Court the final arbiter.
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.721]  And under the EU, you don't have basic liberties and freedoms.
[01:18:29.741 --> 01:18:30.982]  There's no private property rights.
[01:18:31.322 --> 01:18:32.343]  No right to self-defense.
[01:18:32.803 --> 01:18:32.943]  See?
[01:18:35.049 --> 01:18:41.039]  The two sides also signed an open skies deal designed to reduce fares and boost traffic on transatlantic flights.
[01:18:41.339 --> 01:18:44.124]  But little of substance was agreed on on climate change.
[01:18:44.344 --> 01:18:45.325]  That's the global tax.
[01:18:45.365 --> 01:18:46.167]  That's not really true.
[01:18:46.187 --> 01:18:46.748]  We'll tell you why.
[01:18:50.154 --> 01:19:01.405]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:19:01.625 --> 01:19:08.091]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:19:08.331 --> 01:19:08.711]  We're good to go!

[01:19:34.644 --> 01:19:35.705]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:49.893 --> 01:19:53.555]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:19:53.975 --> 01:19:59.379]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:19:59.859 --> 01:20:00.940]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:04.962]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:20:05.662 --> 01:20:18.993]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:20:19.473 --> 01:20:24.818]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.

[01:20:49.813 --> 01:20:52.515]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[01:20:52.915 --> 01:20:55.918]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[01:20:56.198 --> 01:20:58.500]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:02.943]  Now there's SFR Green, performance technologies for a clean planet.
[01:21:03.264 --> 01:21:09.068]  SFR Green's Protecta reduces emissions and improves fuel economy, meeting automakers' new standards.

[01:21:23.268 --> 01:21:25.169]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:21:25.889 --> 01:21:29.051]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:21:29.711 --> 01:21:36.173]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[01:21:51.417 --> 01:21:55.559]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:21:55.779 --> 01:21:57.540]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:04.082]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:22:04.383 --> 01:22:10.505]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:22:10.745 --> 01:22:16.768]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:22:17.068 --> 01:22:23.473]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:22:23.633 --> 01:22:27.156]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.

[01:22:35.362 --> 01:22:36.403]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:22:36.543 --> 01:22:39.326]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.

[01:22:39.806 --> 01:22:39.866]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:23:01.566 --> 01:23:20.932]  On a lonely, lonesome highway East of Omaha I listen to the engine moanin' out his woman's song And I think about the woman The girl you knew the night before
[01:23:27.237 --> 01:23:47.170]  Alright, welcome back.
[01:23:47.210 --> 01:23:48.771]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:48.811 --> 01:23:52.254]  Let's go ahead and play a little minute and a half BBC piece.
[01:23:53.207 --> 01:23:59.930]  About the merger of the EU and the North American Union, and they, just like they sold to the people of Europe, they're sneaking it in.
[01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:08.034]  Here, governmental structures, mergers, agreements that supersede the Congress, that supersede the state legislatures.
[01:24:08.454 --> 01:24:14.256]  Already secret tribunals at the World Trade Organization have more authority than Congress.
[01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:18.518]  It's been that case since 1996 when our government became a signatory to it.
[01:24:19.319 --> 01:24:19.919]  So, here it is.
[01:24:21.133 --> 01:24:24.955]  This was always going to be a summit dominated by economic issues.
[01:24:25.395 --> 01:24:31.998]  German Chancellor Angela Merkel had pushed hard for a drive to deregulate the transatlantic economic area.
[01:24:32.398 --> 01:24:35.959]  She got a commitment from the US to work towards harmonization.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:41.942]  But when the President and the Chancellor got to the Rose Garden, the talk turned to the environment.
[01:24:43.001 --> 01:24:48.763]  Last month, European leaders committed themselves to swinging cuts in their greenhouse gas emissions.
[01:24:49.223 --> 01:24:52.464]  They promised further cuts if America would come on board.
[01:24:53.045 --> 01:24:55.525]  The US has shown no desire to do so.
[01:24:56.026 --> 01:24:59.627]  All the same, in the sunshine, there was a lot of positive talk.
[01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:02.651]  The good news is that we recognize there's a problem.
[01:25:02.671 --> 01:25:07.894]  The good news is we recognize technology is going to lead to solutions and that we're willing to share those technologies.
[01:25:07.914 --> 01:25:11.436]  And we all recognize we've got to deal with the developing world, particularly China and India.
[01:25:11.716 --> 01:25:13.237]  I think it was a real progress.
[01:25:13.877 --> 01:25:15.278]  Of course, it's working in progress.
[01:25:15.378 --> 01:25:17.879]  But as President Bush said, we agree there is a global threat.
[01:25:17.939 --> 01:25:18.900]  It's a serious threat.
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.222]  We agree there is the need to establish a limit to greenhouse gases.
[01:25:24.548 --> 01:25:27.291]  All that good news doesn't translate to results.
[01:25:27.591 --> 01:25:31.475]  Officials acknowledge that on climate change, nothing was achieved today.
[01:25:31.916 --> 01:25:33.157]  Germany will have another go.
[01:25:34.158 --> 01:25:36.640]  Okay, now let's really talk about the facts here.
[01:25:37.641 --> 01:25:46.711]  There are a lot of real environmental problems, genetic engineering, toxic waste dumping, serious problems that are hurting different species and especially our species.
[01:25:48.641 --> 01:25:56.104]  Because we are at the top of the food chain and we really get a lot of these concentrated toxins and poisons and compounds in our tissues and our bloodstream.
[01:25:58.466 --> 01:26:00.607]  Global warming is a complete and total fraud.
[01:26:00.687 --> 01:26:02.288]  Man-made global warming is a fraud.
[01:26:02.388 --> 01:26:09.251]  It is a global tax and they said 30 years ago they were going to have a carbon tax on wellhead and on gas emissions of CO2.
[01:26:09.811 --> 01:26:16.574]  CO2 is actually a life accelerant and then creates higher oxygen levels in the photosynthesis process in plants.
[01:26:17.174 --> 01:26:21.196]  And mammals actually, all the major studies show, enjoy a more oxygen rich environment.
[01:26:21.656 --> 01:26:25.098]  And in Earth's history, due to ice core samples, we've had a much higher level of oxygen.
[01:26:25.738 --> 01:26:32.740]  In fact, carbon dioxide comes in increases after a heating period between 200 and 800 years, depending on the cycle, never at the same time.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:36.241]  Al Gore's numbers are all complete frauds that a two-year-old could figure out.
[01:26:36.581 --> 01:26:37.361]  But that doesn't matter.
[01:26:37.442 --> 01:26:42.143]  It feels good, and so the entire environmental movement will be sucked up and controlled.
[01:26:42.963 --> 01:26:55.609]  By the neo-feudalist that will not help the environment, but will set up a new form of neo-feudalism that the royalty of the planet that have set up the EU and the American Union to be their new imperial palace system.
[01:26:56.489 --> 01:27:03.753]  And we are holdings of a world government system that is owned and controlled by a handful of private banking and royal families.
[01:27:05.746 --> 01:27:10.868]  And here they are just calmly announcing, again, and we've been inside the American Union for years.
[01:27:11.128 --> 01:27:13.368]  The European Union has been around for 50 years.
[01:27:13.388 --> 01:27:14.609]  They just celebrated 50 years.
[01:27:14.649 --> 01:27:19.310]  The public wasn't told about the public government until 7 years ago.
[01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:20.111]  This is how it works.
[01:27:20.171 --> 01:27:23.052]  Again, they celebrate 50 years, but they didn't announce it until 7 years ago.
[01:27:23.092 --> 01:27:23.652]  Remember that.
[01:27:23.692 --> 01:27:24.132]  That's key.
[01:27:24.772 --> 01:27:26.053]  Same thing with the American Union.
[01:27:26.733 --> 01:27:30.714]  If they have their way, 20 years from now, they'll be celebrating 30 years of it.
[01:27:31.754 --> 01:27:34.697]  And people will be going, but wait a minute, it's only been around for five.
[01:27:34.917 --> 01:27:36.498]  They'll probably announce it in a decade.
[01:27:37.979 --> 01:27:39.280]  Because it's unreality.
[01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:54.353]  Getting rid of our borders, paying Social Security for Mexicans and Canadians, merging our military, having NORTHCOM announce they're going to use Mexican and Canadian troops to quote deal with American terrorists, merging the inspection systems,
[01:27:55.426 --> 01:27:59.008]  Under the SPP, they're going to use toll road money in the U.S.
[01:27:59.108 --> 01:28:02.429]  to build the roads to more integrate.
[01:28:02.769 --> 01:28:07.291]  And you're talking about superhighways bringing the 100 million illegal aliens up here.
[01:28:07.892 --> 01:28:11.573]  We're talking about superhighways bringing them up from Latin America into Mexico.
[01:28:12.194 --> 01:28:13.994]  The munialization, the merger.
[01:28:14.855 --> 01:28:18.136]  And so here they are in the BBC announcing a meeting in Washington.
[01:28:18.977 --> 01:28:19.117]  U.S.
[01:28:20.377 --> 01:28:22.138]  and EU agreed a single market.
[01:28:22.651 --> 01:28:28.575]  The United States and the European Union have signed up to a new transatlantic economic partnership at a summit in Washington.
[01:28:28.595 --> 01:28:31.977]  I'll finish up on this, and then go to your calls on the other side.
[01:28:31.997 --> 01:28:37.900]  Stay with us.
[01:28:38.901 --> 01:28:39.861]  We're on the march.
[01:28:40.282 --> 01:28:41.923]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:42.823 --> 01:28:45.505]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:48.672 --> 01:28:55.774]  Craig Walcott, chartered financial consultant and host of the Dead Doctors Don't Lie radio program and million-dollar earner in the network marketing field since 1989.
[01:28:56.134 --> 01:28:57.915]  I certainly know what it takes to succeed.
[01:28:58.175 --> 01:29:03.597]  I also know without proper tools, your chance for significant income in the network marketing field can quickly fade.
[01:29:03.797 --> 01:29:09.778]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing will never spend the time nor money to develop the skills they need.
[01:29:09.998 --> 01:29:12.439]  That's where MLM Incorporated steps in.

[01:29:57.142 --> 01:29:57.722]  Concise?
[01:29:58.002 --> 01:29:58.623]  Hard-hitting?
[01:29:58.983 --> 01:30:01.945]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[01:30:02.265 --> 01:30:03.465]  War in Iran?
[01:30:03.986 --> 01:30:05.627]  A coming One World Church?
[01:30:06.387 --> 01:30:11.691]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.
[01:30:12.211 --> 01:30:21.357]  For a free sample copy of the Divided Kingdom dossier, write to Post Office Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland, 21609.

[01:30:49.062 --> 01:30:52.905]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[01:30:53.165 --> 01:30:57.027]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[01:30:57.388 --> 01:31:02.411]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[01:31:02.691 --> 01:31:13.879]  Electrolyzed Plus Water will alkalize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[01:31:14.199 --> 01:31:18.541]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and environmentally safe for humans and animals.
[01:31:18.801 --> 01:31:28.125]  Alkaline water is available as a concentrate to be mixed with good, filtered, purified RO water, but not tap water, microstructured alkaline antioxidant water for consumption.
[01:31:28.285 --> 01:31:36.168]  Call for your Electrolyzed Plus Alkalinizing Miracle Rejuvenating Water Concentrate or other remarkable RPA Biotech products like Ultimate Fuel,
[01:31:36.528 --> 01:31:38.790]  Sports Performance Drink at 888-212-8871.
[01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:39.791]  That's 888-212-8871.
[01:31:39.911 --> 01:31:44.494]  Or go to Nutramedical.com.
[01:31:44.654 --> 01:31:47.516]  That's N-U-T-R-I with an I. Medical.com.
[01:31:50.319 --> 01:31:54.322]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[01:31:54.402 --> 01:31:57.484]  In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry.
[01:32:01.798 --> 01:32:08.724]  They know that land is the key to all wealth and independence.
[01:32:09.344 --> 01:32:14.269]  And under global environmentalism, they're going to take your land so you can't survive without them.
[01:32:14.289 --> 01:32:16.310]  And I think Hank Williams Jr.
[01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:16.811]  says it all.
[01:32:16.831 --> 01:32:17.772]  Let's play a little bit of the song.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:30.383]  I've got a shotgun, a rifle, and a four-wheel drive and a country boy can survive.
[01:32:30.844 --> 01:32:35.726]  Country folks can survive.
[01:32:39.714 --> 01:32:42.435]  I can flower field all day long.
[01:32:42.535 --> 01:32:46.956]  I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn.
[01:32:48.097 --> 01:32:53.698]  We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too.
[01:32:53.818 --> 01:32:59.280]  Ain't too many things these old boys can't do.
[01:33:00.461 --> 01:33:07.263]  We grow good old tomatoes and homemade wine and country boy can survive.
[01:33:14.802 --> 01:33:15.643]  And the Western Skies!
[01:33:15.663 --> 01:33:16.643]  Alright, welcome back.
[01:33:44.974 --> 01:33:50.617]  Bottom line, we're being domesticated globally.
[01:33:51.377 --> 01:33:53.238]  That's what the quote, rogue nations are.
[01:33:53.298 --> 01:33:57.140]  They're nations that aren't controlled by the New World Order.
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:05.343]  They're areas that aren't monopolized by the private central banking cartels and the handful of private families that own them.
[01:34:07.044 --> 01:34:13.227]  And for those that are still in denial about the process of globalization by stealth,
[01:34:14.088 --> 01:34:16.469]  The merger and integration of our economies.
[01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:21.551]  All you need is the four-year release documents, only some of them.
[01:34:23.171 --> 01:34:24.352]  Imagine the stuff we didn't get.
[01:34:24.832 --> 01:34:29.153]  The Judicial Watch got in January of this year from the September 2006 meeting.
[01:34:32.128 --> 01:34:32.388]  Yes, we are.
[01:34:52.029 --> 01:34:53.130]  We're good to go.
[01:35:11.301 --> 01:35:12.342]  It isn't legitimate.
[01:35:12.662 --> 01:35:21.709]  We must wake the people up and show them the big picture in the program so we can resist them politically, economically, and physically if need be.
[01:35:23.226 --> 01:35:31.109]  So, Judicial Watch got them, World Net Daily did the best article I saw off the hundreds of pages, boiling it down to just three pages.
[01:35:31.210 --> 01:35:34.571]  It had all the quotes about, the first thing was, we gotta keep this secret.
[01:35:34.651 --> 01:35:35.611]  That was the first minutes.
[01:35:36.492 --> 01:35:44.275]  For the media that's here, the top representatives that were there, it was CEOs of media firms and editors of major newspapers and TV producers.
[01:35:44.755 --> 01:35:47.476]  Number one, you're sworn to secrecy, you gotta keep quiet about this.
[01:35:47.757 --> 01:35:50.898]  We gotta keep this quiet to get the North American Union and the New World Order.
[01:35:51.593 --> 01:35:52.594]  I mean, this is the minutes.
[01:35:52.654 --> 01:35:53.474]  You're going to read this.
[01:35:54.115 --> 01:36:07.303]  Secondarily, we've got to get the carbon tax, but we're going to call it something different here in North America, and claim that we're not going along with the Kyoto Protocol, but then we'll tell the public it's something else, and they'll go along with it.
[01:36:07.623 --> 01:36:14.548]  And now you see the states doing that, and Schwarzenegger, and now Newt Gingrich has come out and said global warming's real, and we need to have a tax.
[01:36:15.228 --> 01:36:16.289]  This is the global tax.
[01:36:16.309 --> 01:36:19.191]  This will be the UN tax, shared with the local
[01:36:19.924 --> 01:36:24.708]  Federal and then super state blocks and part of it paid into the UN and NATO.
[01:36:25.389 --> 01:36:25.709]  Alright?
[01:36:25.729 --> 01:36:26.710]  You see how this works?
[01:36:29.112 --> 01:36:30.833]  It's just absolutely amazing.
[01:36:31.033 --> 01:36:35.557]  And then of course that makes the locals beholden to the international because it divvies up the spoils.
[01:36:38.308 --> 01:36:49.897]  Heaven help us, but we can't get the yuppies and the know-it-alls who were told 20 years ago, stylish, cool people know this doesn't exist, and only toothless, idiot hillbillies believe in the North American Union.
[01:36:50.658 --> 01:37:05.850]  And so they, to their dying day, until they announce the North American Union, and set up the Amaro, which they publicly said they want to have, but again, it isn't nightly news, so the yuppies write articles saying I'm crazy, Lou Dobbs is crazy, it doesn't exist, when we have the four-year documents.
[01:37:07.899 --> 01:37:11.961]  But a huge announcement that they've made the agreement and signed the deal to integrate.
[01:37:12.861 --> 01:37:15.302]  Now again, that process has already been going on, so let me explain this.
[01:37:15.602 --> 01:37:21.724]  They create the Asian Union, European Union, American Union, start merging those, that process is already ongoing.
[01:37:22.924 --> 01:37:27.226]  And then they tell you at the point that there's a major economic crash.
[01:37:27.967 --> 01:37:30.649]  Now, again, the Trilateral Commission said this in 1973.
[01:37:30.789 --> 01:37:31.509]  Threw documents in 1978.
[01:37:31.549 --> 01:37:33.290]  Most of them are secret.
[01:37:33.330 --> 01:37:34.171]  Some of them made public.
[01:37:34.211 --> 01:37:35.011]  We have the older ones.
[01:37:35.492 --> 01:37:37.153]  They're going to have the EU rise.
[01:37:37.373 --> 01:37:39.214]  It'll drive the dollar down by over 70%.
[01:37:39.774 --> 01:37:40.514]  You're now seeing that.
[01:37:41.415 --> 01:37:42.616]  How many years have we told you this?
[01:37:42.676 --> 01:37:43.716]  Because we have the documents.
[01:37:43.736 --> 01:37:44.697]  Go look them up for yourselves.
[01:37:44.977 --> 01:37:46.198]  I'm putting them in a new film I'm making.
[01:37:48.379 --> 01:37:50.180]  They will then have the Euro rise.
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:52.662]  Then, oh my gosh, we need one of them Euros too.
[01:37:52.702 --> 01:37:53.562]  We'll have an Amaro.
[01:37:53.602 --> 01:37:54.543]  Then that will rise.
[01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:56.101]  We're good to go!
[01:38:12.637 --> 01:38:30.650]  And again, you can still have your individual currency, but it's dollarized, or whatever the name of the Asian, that hasn't been announced yet, or it's Ameroized, or Euroized, where you still, that's the first phase, like they had in Europe for the ten years before 2000, and the launch of the Euro itself, they're pegged to a common benchmark.
[01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:37.554]  So the Deutschmark to the French Franc, you know, rise and fall together.
[01:38:37.614 --> 01:38:41.197]  So you basically already have the single currency, just different flavors of it.
[01:38:41.557 --> 01:38:46.559]  Kind of like we have a national ID card, but it still is issued at the state level.
[01:38:46.879 --> 01:38:49.780]  Federalized, so you think it's a state driver's license, but it's really federal.
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:54.282]  It's kind of like Sports Illustrated has different Sports Illustrated for each region.
[01:38:54.342 --> 01:38:55.583]  It's still Sports Illustrated.
[01:38:57.203 --> 01:38:58.764]  See, they brand it.
[01:38:59.724 --> 01:39:04.746]  Very slick corporate stuff here that's designed to fool your mammalian senses.
[01:39:06.647 --> 01:39:07.988]  Alright, I said I'd get to your calls.
[01:39:08.008 --> 01:39:09.748]  This is so important, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:10.109 --> 01:39:11.029]  This is the big picture.
[01:39:16.263 --> 01:39:19.093]  There's other points I want to make, but now I'll just go to your calls.
[01:39:19.876 --> 01:39:21.281]  But it's all being done by stealth.
[01:39:22.746 --> 01:39:49.427]  And it's happening before your eyes, and then they'll have these currency speculations, and these currencies rising and falling, and quote, causing economic hardship, which will really be currency speculation, and stock speculation, and insider trading by the globalists, because they always run the system, using it to always, in a centrifugal fashion, consolidate all the wealth and power in their hands, always in a surf, neo-feudal system, the elites waging war against any emerging renaissance middle class,
[01:39:51.312 --> 01:39:56.875]  Neo-mercantilism with a Neo-surf feudal overlay on this road to serfdom.
[01:39:59.836 --> 01:40:10.081]  And then they'll finally just announce, okay, we're going to a globalized currency, global benchmark, digital, as the head of Visa has said, by 2011 is their target date.
[01:40:10.261 --> 01:40:15.223]  They won't get it by then, but it will already be digitized with all the banks globally to a hedged point.
[01:40:16.023 --> 01:40:16.424]  I think?
[01:40:35.435 --> 01:40:36.996]  The new barcodes don't look like a barcode.
[01:40:37.016 --> 01:40:52.988]  This has all been announced and then so they'll just be all this quote new money that's issued by companies and corporations and it's all just accepted and that's how dollars are swept away and then there'll be some currency and some counterfeiting and some problems and some more identity theft.
[01:40:53.008 --> 01:40:54.349]  The whole system is designed for that.
[01:40:54.769 --> 01:41:01.854]  Then they'll come in with a one world government single currency accessed by a biometric identifier of the thumb and face.
[01:41:01.874 --> 01:41:02.795]  This has all been announced.
[01:41:03.275 --> 01:41:04.636]  I'm not talking about the Bible, folks.
[01:41:04.656 --> 01:41:05.956]  This is what the government has said.
[01:41:06.257 --> 01:41:09.358]  And the UN meetings on a world ID in 2000 said.
[01:41:10.038 --> 01:41:10.398]  So there.
[01:41:10.459 --> 01:41:11.839]  You have the entire picture.
[01:41:12.139 --> 01:41:13.580]  That's basically what's going to happen.
[01:41:15.981 --> 01:41:17.082]  And you're going to live to see it.
[01:41:17.142 --> 01:41:19.003]  If you live another 10 years, you're going to see it.
[01:41:20.363 --> 01:41:21.744]  Guaranteed, unless we stop them.
[01:41:22.124 --> 01:41:23.685]  You would have already seen it by 2008.
[01:41:23.725 --> 01:41:24.465]  But they're behind.
[01:41:24.485 --> 01:41:24.665]  7, 8, 9 years.
[01:41:29.438 --> 01:41:37.240]  But they could set a nuke off tomorrow and have this thing implemented very quickly or release a flu pandemic and they're very capable of it and are planning it.
[01:41:38.581 --> 01:41:44.842]  Now you know folks, this is the big picture and basically spelled out as calmly as I can.
[01:41:44.862 --> 01:41:47.143]  I hope Paul Watson does an article on everything I just said.
[01:41:47.843 --> 01:41:56.686]  He does a great job of vetting everything I claim, going and finding all the documents to substantiate it because I'm going off memory from all the documents and articles I read over the last 15 years, almost 13 on air.
[01:41:58.374 --> 01:42:00.915]  And he will always find more and then add to that.
[01:42:00.955 --> 01:42:02.596]  But I want a lengthy treatise on this.
[01:42:03.236 --> 01:42:03.956]  Paul Watson.
[01:42:03.996 --> 01:42:04.656]  We need this out.
[01:42:04.676 --> 01:42:05.337]  We need it out now.
[01:42:05.837 --> 01:42:07.057]  Or Steve Watson if you wish.
[01:42:07.097 --> 01:42:08.518]  He has certainly the training for it.
[01:42:09.298 --> 01:42:12.099]  With a Master's Degree in Political Science and Foreign Affairs.
[01:42:12.519 --> 01:42:15.201]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bill.
[01:42:15.661 --> 01:42:16.561]  Bill, thanks for holding.
[01:42:16.601 --> 01:42:17.141]  You're on the air.
[01:42:17.161 --> 01:42:17.862]  Where are you calling from?
[01:42:17.882 --> 01:42:19.922]  I'm calling from Arizona, Alex.
[01:42:20.282 --> 01:42:20.943]  Welcome, sir.
[01:42:21.143 --> 01:42:25.064]  I've got a little information on that truck crash the other night.
[01:42:25.885 --> 01:42:26.045]  Yes.
[01:42:27.338 --> 01:42:52.638]  the driver he was only like twenty one and uh... there were truckers calling into the radio station saying that the average truck driver tanker drivers twenty five on up he also had four traffic stops traffic stops let me just stop you right there i don't know all of the rules in front of me but i have a lot of trucker friends it's a special license above
[01:42:53.471 --> 01:42:58.313]  The commercial license you've got to get to drive hazardous chemicals or gasoline.
[01:42:58.693 --> 01:43:04.535]  If those guys have had one stop, they get reviewed two, it's automatically revoked for life.
[01:43:05.495 --> 01:43:08.836]  And I thought the average age was like 55 for those guys.
[01:43:09.176 --> 01:43:14.518]  I always look up in the cabs when I see it, it's always an older black guy or white guy or Hispanic guy driving.
[01:43:15.158 --> 01:43:16.719]  They're the best of the best drivers.
[01:43:16.739 --> 01:43:19.820]  They get paid what, double or triple what other drivers get.
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:22.681]  And you're saying he's 21 and had four?
[01:43:23.662 --> 01:43:24.822]  What is he, an illegal alien?
[01:43:25.863 --> 01:43:26.983]  I think he was a Mexican.
[01:43:27.503 --> 01:43:33.606]  When I saw that on the TV, when it was on television, I think he had a Mexican surname.
[01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:38.173]  Oh my God, watch him be a Mexican truck driver from Mexico.
[01:43:38.233 --> 01:43:39.093]  Nothing will be done, of course.
[01:43:39.494 --> 01:43:41.976]  And also, Alex, he had a heroin charge against him.
[01:43:42.316 --> 01:43:42.997]  You're joking.
[01:43:43.297 --> 01:43:43.837]  No, I'm not.
[01:43:43.977 --> 01:43:44.618]  Oh my God.
[01:43:44.998 --> 01:43:54.766]  You see, they don't enforce it, because if you're an illegal alien, you don't have to have a bank account, I mean, cards to have a bank account, you're released by the police even if you're caught with cocaine or heroin.
[01:43:55.006 --> 01:43:56.447]  We just played a newscast yesterday.
[01:43:56.708 --> 01:43:58.189]  I'm not against the illegal aliens.
[01:43:58.209 --> 01:44:01.231]  The point is that this, just wait, you're going to see more of this.
[01:44:01.291 --> 01:44:01.932]  I didn't know that.
[01:44:02.332 --> 01:44:03.353]  Yeah, he did.
[01:44:03.393 --> 01:44:04.314]  He had a heroin charge.
[01:44:05.171 --> 01:44:10.953]  Well, wait a minute, you're not allowed to have that special license if you've even had two traffic tickets.
[01:44:11.673 --> 01:44:11.933]  Right.
[01:44:12.714 --> 01:44:15.715]  I mean, how in the world could he have four and be 21?
[01:44:16.195 --> 01:44:16.935]  That's what I can't figure.
[01:44:16.955 --> 01:44:18.055]  He didn't have the license.
[01:44:18.115 --> 01:44:18.836]  It's going to come out.
[01:44:19.076 --> 01:44:19.636]  We need to know that.
[01:44:19.656 --> 01:44:21.056]  But watch, the government will cover it up.
[01:44:21.477 --> 01:44:27.579]  They were saying that unless he knew somebody within the company that got him the job, that could have been possible.
[01:44:29.419 --> 01:44:31.140]  And also, you know, there was a cab
[01:44:32.845 --> 01:44:34.986]  I hear you and I appreciate that information.
[01:44:35.006 --> 01:44:36.547]  I'll have to check that out.
[01:44:36.847 --> 01:44:37.927]  We'll go do a search on it.
[01:44:37.947 --> 01:44:38.888]  I believe you.
[01:44:38.928 --> 01:44:40.349]  It just never ends.
[01:45:02.242 --> 01:45:05.845]  Mike, you're on the air, and you're calling us from Louisiana?
[01:45:06.405 --> 01:45:07.186]  Yes, Alex.
[01:45:07.266 --> 01:45:08.527]  Thank you so much for taking my call, man.
[01:45:08.547 --> 01:45:10.028]  I'm just really excited to talk with you.
[01:45:10.108 --> 01:45:10.889]  I'm excited to talk to you.
[01:45:10.909 --> 01:45:11.429]  What's on your mind?
[01:45:11.670 --> 01:45:15.513]  Well, I was hoping you could help me publicize something that we're doing, actually, tomorrow night.
[01:45:16.573 --> 01:45:22.538]  We're doing what we call a Salon, or a Discussion Group, on September 11th, the events around it.
[01:45:22.598 --> 01:45:25.400]  It's called 9-11 Truths, Myths, and Unanswered Questions.
[01:45:26.081 --> 01:45:28.443]  And it's being led by a gentleman by the name of Tom Kowitz.
[01:45:29.344 --> 01:45:36.968]  And this is actually really big for us because when this kind of stuff happens in our neighborhood, we're not like Los Angeles or some of the larger cities.
[01:45:37.008 --> 01:45:38.789]  We're a smaller group of people, 200,000 or so.
[01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:41.791]  So I was hoping you'd help me publicize this.
[01:45:42.151 --> 01:45:44.613]  I'd actually send you a press release to your producer.
[01:45:44.633 --> 01:45:49.836]  But basically it's going to be a discussion group open to the public to come and talk and understand some of the
[01:45:50.785 --> 01:45:51.946]  The myths surrounding 9-11.
[01:45:52.326 --> 01:45:54.868]  Tom's pretty well versed in 9-11 events.
[01:45:55.028 --> 01:45:57.210]  Sir, just tell us the date, place, and time.
[01:45:57.590 --> 01:46:04.616]  Okay, it's tomorrow night, May 2nd, Mandeville, Louisiana, on the address is 544 Girard Street.
[01:46:05.597 --> 01:46:08.159]  I have a website, V-I-A-N-N-E-S dot com.
[01:46:12.839 --> 01:46:15.661]  Infos can check out that for directions and also times and that sort of thing.
[01:46:15.901 --> 01:46:16.762]  Well, fantastic!
[01:46:16.782 --> 01:46:17.182]  That's wonderful.
[01:46:17.242 --> 01:46:18.503]  I just want to mention one thing to you too.
[01:46:18.523 --> 01:46:20.885]  Let me just add something to what you just said.
[01:46:21.045 --> 01:46:22.887]  Yeah, I do try to read all the email.
[01:46:22.947 --> 01:46:24.268]  It's hard to respond to all of it.
[01:46:24.548 --> 01:46:28.071]  And there are probably two or three 9-11 events every day.
[01:46:28.171 --> 01:46:30.152]  And so there's no way for me to actually plug them.
[01:46:30.613 --> 01:46:33.995]  But there's lots of 9-11 sites that do attempt to cover all of that.
[01:46:34.336 --> 01:46:35.637]  And so I really apologize.
[01:46:35.657 --> 01:46:37.218]  I just, I'm not capable of doing it.
[01:46:37.678 --> 01:46:43.446]  Well, thank God I got through because you got the first time caller, so I've been trying for about a week now.
[01:46:43.906 --> 01:46:45.709]  But, listen, I wanted to mention one thing to you, too.
[01:46:45.749 --> 01:46:53.679]  Tom and I were doing a little brainstorming, and we've come up with sort of, I think, an ingenious way to approach people who are naysayers and debunkers, so to speak.
[01:46:54.759 --> 01:46:55.499]  Tell us the quiz!
[01:46:55.519 --> 01:46:56.400]  Give us the quiz!
[01:47:14.642 --> 01:47:20.925]  But one of the things that he says is, question number one, how many buildings of the World Trade Center complex collapse on 9-11?
[01:47:20.985 --> 01:47:24.546]  And he gives A, B, C, and D, 5, 4, 3, or 2.
[01:47:25.086 --> 01:47:25.787]  And everyone says 2.
[01:47:25.847 --> 01:47:28.968]  So that's kind of the idea behind it.
[01:47:29.168 --> 01:47:33.350]  People think they know a lot about 9-11, the average Joe off the street that hasn't really investigated.
[01:47:34.091 --> 01:47:37.413]  And this is a way to say, hey, listen, maybe you don't know all that you think you know.
[01:47:38.314 --> 01:47:39.695]  And Tom and I likened it to this.
[01:47:39.735 --> 01:47:42.556]  We said, basically, people don't want to know this information.
[01:47:42.576 --> 01:47:48.380]  It's almost like feeling really, really bad and not going to the doctor because you're afraid of the answer you might get.
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:54.604]  And so this is kind of maybe a way to just enlighten people, educate them to understand, hey, look, you don't know everything.
[01:47:54.624 --> 01:48:00.307]  There's a lot of stuff that you heard originally that information has come out, and now the facts are out, and here are the facts.
[01:48:00.567 --> 01:48:03.209]  And it's well documented as well with websites, some of your
[01:48:03.909 --> 01:48:04.329]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:48:04.349 --> 01:48:04.469]  Hi, I'm 16.
[01:48:04.509 --> 01:48:06.490]  All my friends know about 9-11 and the New World Order.
[01:48:06.510 --> 01:48:11.913]  Actually, we went to a bohemian grove a couple months back and walked in past all the no trespassing signs.
[01:48:11.933 --> 01:48:17.516]  The security stopped us and he talked to us for like 10 minutes.
[01:48:33.098 --> 01:48:35.379]  He's told us all this, like, interesting stuff that I didn't know.
[01:48:35.419 --> 01:48:38.279]  Like, there's actually, like, a 35-year waiting list.
[01:48:39.079 --> 01:48:41.880]  And Bush can't go there until he's done being president.
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:44.340]  And, uh... Well, that's right.
[01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:45.961]  And, again, it's really high security.
[01:48:46.361 --> 01:48:49.722]  Only for the two weeks in July, there's still security there.
[01:48:49.822 --> 01:48:51.762]  But you can, a lot of times, you know, sneak in.
[01:48:51.802 --> 01:48:54.983]  They'll catch you and then throw you out during other times of the year.
[01:48:55.003 --> 01:49:00.024]  But they will arrest you and throw charges on you if you do it when the leaders are there.
[01:49:00.044 --> 01:49:00.964]  Oh, yeah?
[01:49:01.952 --> 01:49:03.713]  How much do you think Bush knows?
[01:49:03.733 --> 01:49:06.675]  Do you think they just give him things to introduce?
[01:49:06.715 --> 01:49:16.221]  Yeah, all Bush does is he's given a folder in the morning and told what he's supposed to go say and do, and he makes absolutely no decisions, and is the biggest puppet president we've ever had.
[01:49:17.362 --> 01:49:18.803]  I think you should get David Icke back on.
[01:49:18.843 --> 01:49:19.643]  He's pretty interesting.
[01:49:20.504 --> 01:49:21.364]  He is interesting.
[01:49:21.624 --> 01:49:23.005]  Certainly the listeners like him.
[01:49:23.105 --> 01:49:23.826]  It's entertaining.
[01:49:24.266 --> 01:49:28.809]  He has a lot to say, but we're going to get David on very, very soon.
[01:49:29.517 --> 01:49:31.780]  In fact, I have him on about once a week.
[01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:37.167]  You've got to give a nod to the icon, even if I don't agree with everything he has to say.
[01:49:38.188 --> 01:49:38.729]  Thank you, Nick.
[01:49:38.769 --> 01:49:39.630]  Good to have you on board.
[01:49:39.970 --> 01:49:40.511]  God bless you.
[01:49:40.531 --> 01:49:42.433]  Alright, Joseph, Chris, and others.
[01:49:42.513 --> 01:49:43.354]  Wide open phones.
[01:49:43.675 --> 01:49:46.158]  A bunch of audio clips coming up in the next hour as well.
[01:49:46.478 --> 01:49:46.879]  Stay with me.
[01:49:51.733 --> 01:49:57.158]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:49:57.538 --> 01:50:05.145]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:05.876 --> 01:50:12.918]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:13.318 --> 01:50:24.741]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:25.061 --> 01:50:28.502]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:29.002 --> 01:50:30.943]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:31.283 --> 01:50:35.124]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:48.630 --> 01:50:51.812]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:50:51.832 --> 01:50:55.875]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:50:56.015 --> 01:50:58.577]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:50:58.637 --> 01:51:00.978]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:51:01.159 --> 01:51:09.604]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:51:09.664 --> 01:51:10.985]  The Berkeley light is different.
[01:51:11.125 --> 01:51:15.128]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:51:15.128 --> 01:51:15.628]  We're good to go!
[01:51:35.538 --> 01:51:38.581]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.

[01:51:48.419 --> 01:51:50.141]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:50.361 --> 01:51:54.065]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:54.385 --> 01:52:03.335]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:03.475 --> 01:52:08.080]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:08.620]  I don't know.
[01:52:26.305 --> 01:52:27.245]  One simple switch.

[01:52:57.394 --> 01:52:59.375]  You know what?

[01:53:01.135 --> 01:53:04.076]  I'm not even going to plug my books and videos and the other materials we carry.
[01:53:05.096 --> 01:53:09.137]  Just know they're at InfoWars.com or you can find the toll free number.
[01:53:09.237 --> 01:53:12.297]  Well, it's 888-253-3139.

[01:53:17.699 --> 01:53:19.679]  Let's go ahead and go to Joseph in Florida.
[01:53:19.699 --> 01:53:20.299]  You're on the air.
[01:53:20.339 --> 01:53:20.679]  Welcome.
[01:53:21.739 --> 01:53:21.859]  Hi.
[01:53:21.919 --> 01:53:22.740]  Thank you very much.
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:24.340]  It's nice talking to you.
[01:53:25.611 --> 01:53:35.538]  This thing today, the announcement that came out between the puppets, the European puppets and Bushy, is just smacks of New World Order.
[01:53:35.938 --> 01:53:37.259]  I mean, it's May Day.
[01:53:37.279 --> 01:53:47.346]  Let's not forget this was the day that the Communists and the Anarchists took over and destroyed the civilization of the Russians, the Chinese.
[01:53:48.086 --> 01:53:49.667]  It's just smacks of New World Order.
[01:53:49.707 --> 01:53:51.289]  It's time for folks to get off the bench.
[01:53:52.329 --> 01:53:53.210]  I got off the bench
[01:53:53.991 --> 01:54:01.496]  Back when I was 19, I went to New World Order University, when the FBI raided, uh, you know, this kind of talks about what happened with the lady yesterday.
[01:54:02.076 --> 01:54:16.946]  When the FBI raided the business I worked at, and, you know, took the owner and his wife, charged them with conspiracy, and basically chipping boards, which they have no technical knowledge of doing, uh, sent them to the federal prison for six hours a month just to work the business.
[01:54:17.747 --> 01:54:22.110]  And of course, you know, back then we just had the occasional Ruby Ridge and Waco, but
[01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:24.491]  This just smacks New World Order.
[01:54:24.651 --> 01:54:27.592]  I mean, it's just, uh, this has been going on actually for a couple of years.
[01:54:28.592 --> 01:54:32.654]  I've been doing some pre-call research, and this has been going on for a couple of years.
[01:54:32.754 --> 01:54:41.297]  Oh yeah, they've been merging the North American Union and the EU together, and there are some people who are neocons who say there isn't even an EU.
[01:54:41.897 --> 01:54:43.878]  I've got emails saying I'm making that up.
[01:54:44.398 --> 01:54:45.798]  There's no move for global government.
[01:54:45.838 --> 01:54:46.379]  There's no EU.
[01:54:46.539 --> 01:54:49.860]  Well, it shows that the program is actually taking effect.
[01:54:50.465 --> 01:54:52.326]  Um, but it's time for folks to get off the bench.
[01:54:52.366 --> 01:55:08.272]  Now, I got off the bench, uh, I was actually, you know, and I've never really said this publicly, but I'm, I'm working behind the scenes, but I was a former CB in 2001, um, suffered some personal loss and had kind of a life-changing experience.
[01:55:08.292 --> 01:55:17.215]  And then of course, you know, September 11th, and then we had the Operation Enduring Freedom, which, uh, I just felt was completely wrong in my heart.
[01:55:18.573 --> 01:55:20.734]  I felt God was telling me that it was completely wrong.
[01:55:20.754 --> 01:55:26.537]  So I filed papers and was dishonorably discharged, conscientiously objected to the war.
[01:55:27.138 --> 01:55:30.660]  I agreed to, I wanted to stay with the Navy because I love the Seabees and the Navy.
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:39.324]  I wanted to stay and I told them, I was like, hey, if somebody comes and invades this country, you know, if they come to my home, I'm going to take care of business.
[01:55:40.145 --> 01:55:42.786]  But I knew then it was just, it was New World Order.
[01:55:43.527 --> 01:55:44.747]  This right today is New World Order.
[01:55:44.767 --> 01:55:45.648]  I feel the same thing.
[01:55:46.423 --> 01:55:57.270]  Yeah, well they claim we've got to go fight in Iraq to save America, but the very people doing that are dismantling the country and erasing the borders and trying to legalize the illegal aliens.
[01:55:57.650 --> 01:55:58.851]  They are the traitors.
[01:55:59.271 --> 01:56:01.012]  They are the ones killing the country.
[01:56:01.412 --> 01:56:03.554]  They're the people the military should be fighting.
[01:56:04.034 --> 01:56:06.896]  Exactly, and that's what I thought I was doing.
[01:56:06.916 --> 01:56:07.836]  That's why I was fighting them.
[01:56:08.577 --> 01:56:10.238]  And so now on the outside I've been
[01:56:11.343 --> 01:56:15.185]  So now you can't supposedly own a gun because you were dishonorably discharged?
[01:56:15.545 --> 01:56:19.447]  Oh no, I was just dishonorably discharged.
[01:56:20.387 --> 01:56:22.328]  I can own a gun, they didn't take away my freedoms, no.
[01:56:22.949 --> 01:56:24.209]  I'm legally on fire.
[01:56:24.269 --> 01:56:25.630]  Well they can't take away your freedoms.
[01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:27.971]  Exactly, they didn't give them to me.
[01:56:28.011 --> 01:56:28.991]  God gave me my freedoms.
[01:56:29.852 --> 01:56:33.373]  But no, I don't have any kind of repercussions other than it's just on my record.
[01:56:33.914 --> 01:56:37.075]  But it was a trying experience, I'll say that.
[01:56:37.615 --> 01:56:38.756]  It was a very trying experience.
[01:56:39.341 --> 01:56:42.703]  I was called a traitor, a coward, you know, how could you do this after 9-11, blah, blah, blah.
[01:56:42.763 --> 01:56:46.545]  Well, I mean, how do you shoot the troops up with experimental shots that kill them?
[01:56:46.845 --> 01:56:49.807]  How do you have us breathe DU when your own manuals say don't do it?
[01:56:50.107 --> 01:56:52.008]  They are the traitors, they are the cowards.
[01:56:52.308 --> 01:56:59.832]  It took more courage, what you did, saying no, against all of that brainwashing and peer pressure than those men will ever have.
[01:56:59.852 --> 01:57:04.715]  Well, you know, I say that because the people need to know that they can do something.
[01:57:04.855 --> 01:57:08.557]  And whether you're just educating somebody or actually taking a stand,
[01:57:09.011 --> 01:57:11.513]  I mean, you know, because, like, nowadays everything's peaceful.
[01:57:11.533 --> 01:57:12.894]  I'm happily married, thank God.
[01:57:13.575 --> 01:57:17.939]  And, um, you know, I have a great life, but, I mean, there's still cameras at the end of my roads.
[01:57:18.559 --> 01:57:20.441]  And I try to tell the people, look, there's cameras up there.
[01:57:20.841 --> 01:57:25.966]  Well, let's just, you know, let's, because, well, the police won't catch the robbers and the... No, the cameras are... Stay there.
[01:57:26.086 --> 01:57:26.466]  Stay there.

[01:57:44.964 --> 01:57:45.604]  Big Brother.
[01:57:46.265 --> 01:57:47.325]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:48.045 --> 01:57:49.126]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:49.806 --> 01:57:50.607]  You want answers?
[01:57:51.367 --> 01:57:52.267]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:52.287 --> 01:57:56.589]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:57.110 --> 01:58:01.212]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:02.112 --> 01:58:08.155]  There was a big article in the New York Times two days ago that I never even covered on air.
[01:58:08.195 --> 01:58:10.016]  I'm gonna dig it out and cover it later if I have time.
[01:58:11.115 --> 01:58:17.558]  They announced that the trial by jury is virtually extinct.
[01:58:17.618 --> 01:58:18.439]  That was the headline.
[01:58:20.079 --> 01:58:20.920]  Or it was similar to that.
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.020]  I'll dig it out.
[01:58:23.161 --> 01:58:24.962]  I was just looking at this headline in front of me.
[01:58:25.562 --> 01:58:28.123]  Police plant marijuana on 92-year-old woman.
[01:58:28.543 --> 01:58:30.364]  Well, they did a lot more than plant marijuana on her.
[01:58:30.404 --> 01:58:31.205]  They killed her.
[01:58:33.426 --> 01:58:35.747]  But that's okay, because they're just keeping us safe.
[01:58:36.227 --> 01:58:38.088]  You know, we had a nice police officer call in yesterday.
[01:58:38.108 --> 01:58:39.629]  He said, you know, you're painting with a broad brush.
[01:58:42.412 --> 01:58:54.301]  Well, I know there are a lot of good police, okay, and good people in government, period, but the government itself is corrupt and evil and has a very wicked direction it's taking.
[01:58:55.622 --> 01:59:09.672]  It'd be like if a big ship, and I was out in a rowboat, and some 150,000 ton Leviathan was about to run over my rowboat, and there's some nice people up on the deck, but they're not piloting it, and I'm screaming at the ship saying, Stop!
[01:59:09.752 --> 01:59:10.773]  Stop, you evil ship!
[01:59:13.536 --> 01:59:19.000]  And there's an evil captain who wants to run me over, and you're up on the deck going, how dare you talk bad about us!
[01:59:19.541 --> 01:59:21.082]  You're saying we're not nice!
[01:59:21.923 --> 01:59:23.644]  Yeah, you're running over the top of me!
[01:59:26.687 --> 01:59:28.528]  And by the way, you're getting run over by the ship, too.
[01:59:28.708 --> 01:59:30.350]  And that's what's so frustrating about it.
[01:59:31.931 --> 01:59:34.453]  The government is illegitimate, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:34.473 --> 01:59:36.234]  They selectively enforce whatever they want.
[01:59:36.254 --> 01:59:38.156]  They're involved in every type of crime you can imagine.
[01:59:39.472 --> 01:59:42.034]  It's worse than any satire.
[01:59:42.254 --> 01:59:46.478]  It's worse than anything, you know, that Bacon ever wrote.
[01:59:47.138 --> 01:59:50.521]  It's just... It's unspeakable.
[01:59:51.742 --> 01:59:54.204]  Let's go ahead and go back real fast.
[01:59:54.224 --> 01:59:57.066]  I want to get one more call in before we end this segment and go on to others.
[01:59:58.387 --> 01:59:59.628]  Joseph, finish up what you were saying.
[02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.949]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:00.989 --> 02:00:06.213]  I was just describing the cameras that are here in Ocala, Florida, where I live, that they watch the people.
[02:00:06.914 --> 02:00:08.435]  The people think it's all for their safety.
[02:00:09.185 --> 02:00:20.027]  Um, of course, you know, they'll have inadvertent checkpoints and stuff and I'll get stopped on my way to work and not even be accused of speeding with, with, when they're asking me, you know, can I please tell me how fast you were going?
[02:00:20.067 --> 02:00:20.948]  Oh, you were just speeding.
[02:00:21.028 --> 02:00:25.029]  I see people, you know, driving by that obviously aren't from around here.
[02:00:25.509 --> 02:00:26.989]  And it just, it's very frustrating.
[02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:28.429]  It's very frustrating sometimes.
[02:00:28.489 --> 02:00:35.551]  And what I try to do behind the scenes, educate people, try to, um, help the troops who are in, that I keep in contact with who want to get out.
[02:00:36.258 --> 02:00:38.080]  I've moved here to be with my wife, yes sir.
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:39.001]  Not yet, but I mean it's...
[02:00:59.316 --> 02:01:01.857]  Uh... that is the last place to have children.
[02:01:02.338 --> 02:01:05.259]  New York City would be better than Florida.
[02:01:05.759 --> 02:01:06.720]  And it's second worst.
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:10.482]  I would uh... I would move
[02:01:11.201 --> 02:01:12.182]  I'm going back to Mississippi.
[02:01:12.602 --> 02:01:16.585]  We're working on it because we see what's happening and we talk about it.
[02:01:16.605 --> 02:01:17.565]  Florida is pioneering.
[02:01:30.854 --> 02:01:41.462]  You get pulled over for no seatbelt or you don't have your insurance card up to date, you have insurance, they take your kids there and then, I mean, they'll take them and fly them to Saudi Arabia right in front of you.
[02:01:41.842 --> 02:01:44.184]  I mean, I've never seen anything like Florida.
[02:01:44.264 --> 02:01:49.828]  I mean, that place is... We just got over DCS situation with our family.
[02:01:50.008 --> 02:01:50.709]  Oh, wow!
[02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:52.971]  We just got over DCS.
[02:01:53.791 --> 02:01:56.913]  My in-laws, their son was abducted by DCS.
[02:01:56.933 --> 02:02:00.116]  They came in, accused them of drugs.
[02:02:01.073 --> 02:02:12.662]  And obviously couldn't find anything, they snatched the child up, and only by the grace of God, my wife and I were able to take care of him, you know, for the three months that DCF had legal custody, and it was just a complete nightmare.
[02:02:12.862 --> 02:02:17.226]  Well that's because, now you ran into good ones there, not as horrible as that was.
[02:02:17.806 --> 02:02:19.848]  And again, people don't know, don't let them in your house.
[02:02:19.888 --> 02:02:21.369]  Look, get out of Florida.
[02:02:22.330 --> 02:02:25.832]  There needs to be like an exodus, like the Israelites leaving hell.
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:29.641]  Leaving Egypt.
[02:02:29.781 --> 02:02:30.561]  Get out of there.
[02:02:30.741 --> 02:02:35.365]  Anyone who lives in Florida is completely and totally insane.
[02:02:35.465 --> 02:02:37.066]  It is the worst state in the Union.
[02:02:37.366 --> 02:02:38.107]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:40.729 --> 02:02:44.291]  It's here.
[02:02:44.452 --> 02:02:49.235]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:49.615 --> 02:02:57.261]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:57.941 --> 02:03:04.984]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:05.384 --> 02:03:16.828]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:17.128 --> 02:03:20.589]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:21.090 --> 02:03:23.010]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:27.192]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:43.417 --> 02:03:46.198]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:46.478 --> 02:03:50.640]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:51.900]  So what do you do?
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:56.762]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:03:57.262 --> 02:03:59.384]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:03:59.864 --> 02:04:00.765]  Sheltering in Place.
[02:04:01.165 --> 02:04:04.889]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[02:04:05.209 --> 02:04:14.577]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:04:28.667 --> 02:04:28.887]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:04:40.625 --> 02:04:47.128]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:04:47.348 --> 02:04:51.390]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:04:51.630 --> 02:04:53.791]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:04:54.131 --> 02:05:01.114]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[02:05:01.474 --> 02:05:04.095]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[02:05:04.355 --> 02:05:07.857]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[02:05:08.137 --> 02:05:16.020]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:05:16.401 --> 02:05:17.881]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:05:18.181 --> 02:05:20.642]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X,
[02:05:21.983 --> 02:05:30.110]  in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[02:05:30.570 --> 02:05:32.872]  Or online at drugstore.com.
[02:05:33.292 --> 02:05:38.676]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:05:41.399 --> 02:05:47.043]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:47.103 --> 02:05:50.386]  All right, let's jam in some more calls and then I need to
[02:05:51.344 --> 02:05:52.806]  Get into some of these audio clips.
[02:05:52.846 --> 02:05:59.272]  Boy, there is a bunch of them that I have here today.
[02:06:01.814 --> 02:06:05.057]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Chris.
[02:06:05.137 --> 02:06:06.138]  Chris, where you calling us from?
[02:06:06.158 --> 02:06:07.719]  Michigan.
[02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:08.340]  Welcome.
[02:06:09.701 --> 02:06:10.362]  How you doing today?
[02:06:10.542 --> 02:06:10.902]  Good, sir.
[02:06:12.164 --> 02:06:15.026]  I just got three short things I'd like to go over with you.
[02:06:15.767 --> 02:06:16.468]  You got the floor.
[02:06:16.508 --> 02:06:16.828]  Go ahead.
[02:06:17.971 --> 02:06:22.757]  First of all, I want to start getting more aggressive with infecting 9-11 crew.
[02:06:23.658 --> 02:06:31.587]  I want to start going into, there's a trade center called Gibraltar Trade Center, and I'd like to buy a booth and just hand out DVDs.
[02:06:32.368 --> 02:06:37.314]  And I had talked to them a couple years ago, and they said that I would need a letter of permission.
[02:06:39.136 --> 02:06:47.182]  Yeah, that letter of permission, this is like Groundhog Day on the show, it just goes on and on and on, but I'm glad you're trying to take the initiative.
[02:06:47.222 --> 02:06:55.829]  There's a letter on Infowars.com that says for non-profit educational purposes you can air them on AXS TV or make copies if they're not for sale.
[02:06:56.590 --> 02:06:57.851]  Sir, just write up your own letter.
[02:06:57.911 --> 02:06:59.632]  I mean, it's really easy, just get around it.
[02:06:59.652 --> 02:07:03.375]  You know, when they ask you, is that your video, you say, yeah, it's my video.
[02:07:04.463 --> 02:07:07.604]  I mean just, you know, this is a war.
[02:07:07.644 --> 02:07:08.505]  Just do what it takes.
[02:07:08.945 --> 02:07:09.485]  Get it done.
[02:07:10.585 --> 02:07:14.827]  Alright, because I know you come right out and say, you know, that you want them distributed.
[02:07:14.947 --> 02:07:15.407]  That's right!
[02:07:15.447 --> 02:07:17.008]  So you say you've got the rights to it.
[02:07:17.348 --> 02:07:20.509]  Anybody that shows up demanding you show them contracts is pure bull.
[02:07:20.909 --> 02:07:28.092]  They don't make people at a swap meet or at a, you know, flea market or anywhere else sit there and show contracts.
[02:07:28.112 --> 02:07:30.713]  They don't make video stores show they have contracts to sell stuff.
[02:07:32.495 --> 02:07:38.877]  That's all just part of the Mafia America, where all these nobodies just go around bossing us and everybody just follows orders.
[02:07:41.257 --> 02:07:42.798]  Alright, well I'll get on that.
[02:07:42.818 --> 02:07:50.300]  The other thing I wanted to talk about was I wanted to mention a warning for NACERA.
[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:52.380]  I don't know if you're familiar with NACERA.
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.981]  Yeah, why don't you tell us about it?
[02:07:55.681 --> 02:07:59.482]  The National Economic Safety and Reformation Act
[02:08:00.819 --> 02:08:10.902]  Your listeners can find out more about that at NassaraSucks.com and it is the Fallen Angel Antichrist agenda basically.
[02:08:10.942 --> 02:08:14.043]  It's a bribe to take the chip is what it is.
[02:08:16.504 --> 02:08:18.945]  Alright sir, I appreciate your call, I really do.
[02:08:19.605 --> 02:08:22.246]  Let's go ahead now and take some more calls.
[02:08:22.266 --> 02:08:24.687]  Let's talk to Alex in New York.
[02:08:24.747 --> 02:08:25.487]  Go ahead Alex.
[02:08:25.927 --> 02:08:29.169]  Hello Alex, long time listener, first time caller.
[02:08:29.429 --> 02:08:30.329]  Welcome to the Airwaves.
[02:08:30.954 --> 02:08:36.901]  I wanted to call and say one about the police state in America.
[02:08:37.622 --> 02:08:40.145]  My friends for a long time never believed me.
[02:08:40.625 --> 02:08:45.871]  I told them about how the schools could lock us down in there if there was a reason and they wouldn't believe me.
[02:08:47.549 --> 02:08:48.950]  I want to just comment on this.
[02:09:16.619 --> 02:09:38.628]  All over the country they have drills from Missouri to Ohio to New York and I've seen it everywhere where they don't allow the children to eat all day to quote make it more real then in some cases they make them urinate and defecate in trash cans in full view of the class and this is all to train you and the parents
[02:09:39.466 --> 02:09:41.187]  That the school owns the children.
[02:09:41.227 --> 02:09:46.912]  Now they're saying they're the guardian and that they run your children when they're in the schools.
[02:09:47.112 --> 02:09:50.955]  So these are nothing but FEMA training camps incrementally.
[02:09:51.496 --> 02:09:58.741]  And in some places they come in unannounced with police pointing guns at them, screaming at them, telling them they're going to kill them.
[02:09:59.082 --> 02:10:01.604]  Sometimes the cops play the part of bad guys unannounced.
[02:10:02.084 --> 02:10:04.266]  Children, we have video, are in total terror.
[02:10:04.286 --> 02:10:05.567]  We're talking elementary students.
[02:10:06.187 --> 02:10:07.990]  They'll still throw fake blood on them.
[02:10:08.090 --> 02:10:10.454]  You cannot make this type of stuff up.
[02:10:10.534 --> 02:10:11.176]  It's mass.
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.241]  Re-education camps.
[02:10:13.661 --> 02:10:16.783]  This is worse than what Soviets did in re-education camps.
[02:10:16.883 --> 02:10:19.265]  In plain view, in the average American takes it.
[02:10:19.505 --> 02:10:21.647]  Thumb scanners are going in to get school lunches.
[02:10:22.067 --> 02:10:22.887]  School searches.
[02:10:22.967 --> 02:10:27.991]  Police dogs will just... They'll have everybody in the school line up and the police dogs will start biting their bags.
[02:10:28.431 --> 02:10:33.194]  From Goose Creek, North Carolina to Houston, Texas.
[02:10:33.294 --> 02:10:35.015]  It's just all training us to be prisoners.
[02:10:35.436 --> 02:10:35.776]  Go ahead.
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:44.501]  Oh yeah, I know, it's like being a prisoner now, you see.
[02:10:44.521 --> 02:10:47.302]  Oh, you got a problem with the warden?
[02:10:47.702 --> 02:10:54.865]  Well, now you're gonna have to... We're gonna show you who the boss is, alright?
[02:10:54.925 --> 02:11:05.369]  We have a class, in your senior year you take it, it's called Participation in Government, and they tell you, well, you have main three freedoms and whatnot, and then you start bringing up
[02:11:05.874 --> 02:11:12.817]  Yeah, well, a lot of kids I learned in there didn't know their rights, and I started giving them some, uh, a few of them.
[02:11:12.957 --> 02:11:15.978]  And let me guess, they told you keep your mouth shut!
[02:11:16.378 --> 02:11:24.381]  Well, the teacher stopped, like, calling on me when I was in the class, and then we started getting cops located, like, put into our school, four cops.
[02:11:25.102 --> 02:11:29.563]  It's like they flagged them to tell them about it, and then I would decide one day, um, uh,
[02:11:31.303 --> 02:11:37.748]  A day to wear my 9-11 Sin Inside Job t-shirt and I got stares by all the cops all day.
[02:11:37.848 --> 02:11:38.568]  Good, good.
[02:11:38.608 --> 02:11:39.609]  Get everybody else to wear them.
[02:11:39.629 --> 02:11:40.169]  And you know what?
[02:11:40.549 --> 02:11:45.813]  You want to go get a whole job for yourself, enjoy it, and take that money and put yourself in private school.
[02:11:46.474 --> 02:11:50.977]  Well, I dropped out of the system and I went into homeschool to finish up.
[02:11:51.257 --> 02:11:52.218]  Good, good.
[02:11:52.298 --> 02:11:54.119]  Leave that concentration camp alone.
[02:11:54.619 --> 02:11:57.101]  And I felt more freer and
[02:11:57.902 --> 02:11:58.763]  I don't know.
[02:12:15.991 --> 02:12:17.471]  Zombie enemies are everywhere.
[02:12:17.672 --> 02:12:18.492]  And I mean this, folks.
[02:12:18.532 --> 02:12:19.412]  This is the reality.
[02:12:19.732 --> 02:12:21.293]  Brainwashed zombies are everywhere.
[02:12:21.473 --> 02:12:22.493]  You've got to be aware of them.
[02:12:22.513 --> 02:12:24.113]  You've got to be sardonic in your view.
[02:12:24.454 --> 02:12:25.634]  Wake up those that care.
[02:12:26.074 --> 02:12:27.054]  Those that laugh at you.
[02:12:27.114 --> 02:12:27.574]  Move on.
[02:12:27.634 --> 02:12:28.575]  Feel sorry for them.
[02:12:28.835 --> 02:12:30.435]  And just be hardcore leaders.
[02:12:30.775 --> 02:12:32.956]  I want the youth to stop playing the video games.
[02:12:33.196 --> 02:12:34.536]  To stop watching the TV.
[02:12:34.817 --> 02:12:36.117]  To start being clean cut.
[02:12:36.197 --> 02:12:39.518]  Not because it's cool, but because you stay out of the enemy's system.
[02:12:39.898 --> 02:12:50.483]  Let me tell you, in this war, having the funky hairdo, having the tats, having that outfit, the police have been told to alert on you as a perp, that is, as an enemy soldier.
[02:12:50.723 --> 02:12:52.944]  The government tells us to line up against each other.
[02:12:53.224 --> 02:12:53.424]  No.
[02:12:53.804 --> 02:13:06.150]  In the urban warfare combat zone, you need to wear black dress shoes, slacks or nice blue jeans, button up shirts or at least t-shirts, short hair, be very confident, smile, and just know, enemies are all around you.
[02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:07.250]  You're moving forward.
[02:13:07.370 --> 02:13:08.451]  You're going to wake people up.
[02:13:08.611 --> 02:13:09.411]  We're unstoppable.
[02:13:09.411 --> 02:13:11.272]  Yeah, I just wanted to say thank you for your films, your podcast.
[02:13:11.332 --> 02:13:12.172]  I use it to listen to you whenever.
[02:13:28.138 --> 02:13:29.379]  I'm not at the house.
[02:13:29.399 --> 02:13:32.861]  I haven't missed a show since I started listening in August.
[02:13:33.101 --> 02:13:37.304]  And I just want to say God bless you and your crew in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:13:37.424 --> 02:13:38.205]  Well, how old are you?
[02:13:38.685 --> 02:13:38.825]  I'm 19.
[02:13:38.925 --> 02:13:40.606]  I'm turning 20 this summer.
[02:13:40.827 --> 02:13:41.127]  All right.
[02:13:41.147 --> 02:13:41.867]  Well, God bless you.
[02:13:41.887 --> 02:13:43.188]  And it's good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:13:43.228 --> 02:13:43.648]  Take care.
[02:13:43.689 --> 02:13:48.912]  And I'm glad that, I guess, whatever you said last year, whenever you got out of school and got out of there, that's good.
[02:13:48.932 --> 02:13:51.174]  And now they're turning the colleges into prisons.
[02:13:51.854 --> 02:13:54.075]  And now they're turning the buildings into prisons.
[02:13:54.616 --> 02:13:56.117]  Oh, there was a shooting at the beach.
[02:13:56.197 --> 02:13:57.718]  So now we've got to turn it into a prison.
[02:13:59.008 --> 02:14:03.412]  You know, a couple times a year, my children love the beach, so I'll drive down to the Texas coast to Port Aransas.
[02:14:04.332 --> 02:14:06.394]  And I'm going to look for another smaller town to go to.
[02:14:06.414 --> 02:14:08.135]  I'm not going to probably go to Port A anymore.
[02:14:08.536 --> 02:14:10.998]  And I want everybody to let Port A, and we ought to call.
[02:14:11.118 --> 02:14:13.500]  You ought to call, and this is how it's done.
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:25.229]  If you go to Port A, where I've been going since I was a little boy, where my dad was going since he was a little bitty boy, deep sea fishing, driving down there, 21 state police instead of one or two,
[02:14:26.019 --> 02:14:29.700]  If you go a couple miles over the speed limit, now they pull you over and give you tickets and want to search your car.
[02:14:30.220 --> 02:14:32.821]  Once you get there now, there's suddenly police everywhere.
[02:14:33.301 --> 02:14:38.722]  And they just randomly pull up and they randomly go and check your stickers and give you tickets while you're out there playing volleyball.
[02:14:39.462 --> 02:14:40.743]  And I just, I just can't do it.
[02:14:40.803 --> 02:14:46.684]  I can't go on vacation and watch police just sit there and... I mean, we're already bringing money into your town.
[02:14:46.944 --> 02:14:50.645]  We're already staying in motels and hotels and condominiums and beach houses.
[02:14:50.905 --> 02:14:52.305]  We're already eating your food.
[02:14:52.605 --> 02:14:54.826]  We're already paying your stinking salary.
[02:14:55.766 --> 02:15:00.169]  And, uh, it's one thing to see cops if somebody's speeding or somebody's drunk or give them a ticket.
[02:15:00.189 --> 02:15:01.090]  Great, we need that.
[02:15:01.690 --> 02:15:02.191]  But, no.
[02:15:02.991 --> 02:15:07.034]  Uh, I had the police pull up and check and see if we had the parking permit.
[02:15:07.435 --> 02:15:08.435]  This was never enforced.
[02:15:08.475 --> 02:15:13.259]  Now the entire 10 mile long beach, now you gotta buy some ugly sticker to stick in your window.
[02:15:13.919 --> 02:15:22.966]  And, uh, they've got these other little tattletale attendants that drive around in motorized golf carts telling you, hey, you're gonna get a ticket if you don't have that stuck to the dash.
[02:15:22.986 --> 02:15:24.767]  You gotta have it stuck to the dash.
[02:15:25.382 --> 02:15:28.084]  You can't just have it laying up there when you go to the beach twice a year.
[02:15:28.524 --> 02:15:30.185]  And there's cops bugging their eyes out.
[02:15:30.306 --> 02:15:32.507]  The constables are really bad in those little red cars.
[02:15:33.188 --> 02:15:35.289]  Literally, I watched them riding.
[02:15:35.309 --> 02:15:38.431]  I mean, they would just go down the line riding everybody's ticket.
[02:15:38.471 --> 02:15:39.732]  Hundreds of tickets for three days.
[02:15:40.032 --> 02:15:40.853]  And it made me sick.
[02:15:41.173 --> 02:15:43.455]  You've ruined Puerto Ranzas for me.
[02:15:44.235 --> 02:15:47.918]  And I can't get, you know, I guess I'm like a sea turtle or a bird or something.
[02:15:47.938 --> 02:15:50.039]  I go back to the ancestral places.
[02:15:50.059 --> 02:15:52.181]  You know, my dad's Uncle Houston.
[02:15:53.098 --> 02:15:57.921]  When he was 13, you know, ran away to the Texas coast to go on a steamship around the world and came back.
[02:15:57.941 --> 02:16:00.843]  You know, that's where he was going fishing since he was a young man.
[02:16:01.123 --> 02:16:01.943]  He took my dad there.
[02:16:01.963 --> 02:16:02.684]  He took my uncle there.
[02:16:02.724 --> 02:16:03.544]  My dad took me there.
[02:16:03.804 --> 02:16:04.525]  It's ruined now.
[02:16:05.105 --> 02:16:07.286]  There's just goon police everywhere.
[02:16:07.626 --> 02:16:08.407]  It's ruined!
[02:16:08.587 --> 02:16:09.508]  You've ruined it!
[02:16:09.528 --> 02:16:16.151]  I mean, it's like we all live in junior high or something in a reform school.
[02:16:16.191 --> 02:16:17.472]  Everybody's looking after us.
[02:16:17.512 --> 02:16:18.713]  There's cameras everywhere.
[02:16:19.941 --> 02:16:22.183]  His CPS is grabbing everybody's kids.
[02:16:22.203 --> 02:16:24.184]  There's just cops everywhere writing his tickets.
[02:16:25.825 --> 02:16:27.647]  Absolutely ruined Port Aransas.
[02:16:27.707 --> 02:16:28.507]  It's ruined!
[02:16:28.527 --> 02:16:32.110]  That town is ruined.
[02:16:32.130 --> 02:16:33.431]  Let me give everybody a news flash.
[02:16:33.871 --> 02:16:35.953]  Port A is ruined.
[02:16:39.135 --> 02:16:42.017]  It's ruined by a bunch of greedy boss hogs.
[02:16:43.778 --> 02:16:44.679]  And it won't stop there.
[02:16:44.699 --> 02:16:48.001]  They'll set up a big CPS in Port A and start grabbing your kids while you're down there.
[02:16:48.382 --> 02:16:48.742]  You'll see.
[02:16:50.339 --> 02:16:52.419]  Everything has to be ruined by you people.
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:17:00.201]  But heaven knows the illegal aliens will be left alone out on the beach to drunkenly wallow around and have no inspection stickers.
[02:17:01.101 --> 02:17:06.422]  In fact, I used to like to drive up and down the beach and just see people catching fish or drive the different jetties.
[02:17:06.962 --> 02:17:07.663]  And doing it, I couldn't.
[02:17:07.683 --> 02:17:09.183]  There were just cops everywhere writing tickets.
[02:17:09.203 --> 02:17:10.343]  It was making me so nauseated.
[02:17:10.623 --> 02:17:13.504]  And I'd watch them pull in, and I'd pull in to get my camera out.
[02:17:13.524 --> 02:17:14.044]  I couldn't help it.
[02:17:14.890 --> 02:17:15.771]  And I'd videotape them.
[02:17:15.791 --> 02:17:18.092]  They'd walk right by the illegals' vehicles and leave them alone.
[02:17:18.112 --> 02:17:21.395]  I'd get out and walk over and people'd flip me off and say, what are you doing looking at our cars?
[02:17:21.415 --> 02:17:22.515]  Oh, I'm just doing an investigation.
[02:17:22.736 --> 02:17:24.217]  That's right, I was doing investigations.
[02:17:24.497 --> 02:17:27.539]  The illegal aliens leave them right alone, but they don't have money to suck off of.
[02:17:27.719 --> 02:17:29.620]  They're not the big, dumb Americans.
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:36.105]  The right whale that just sits there smiling while you throw your red hot harpoons into our fat little backs.
[02:17:42.620 --> 02:17:47.124]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:47.484 --> 02:17:51.567]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:51.867 --> 02:17:52.408]  We listened.
[02:17:52.728 --> 02:17:57.712]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:17:57.972 --> 02:17:58.452]  We listened.
[02:17:58.853 --> 02:18:01.875]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:02.315 --> 02:18:02.856]  We listened.
[02:18:03.316 --> 02:18:05.438]  You asked us to include an emergency light for
[02:18:05.558 --> 02:18:06.218]  We're good.
[02:18:23.727 --> 02:18:26.369]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[02:18:26.569 --> 02:18:26.769]  Only $279.

[02:18:39.764 --> 02:18:40.744]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:18:40.824 --> 02:18:45.586]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:18:45.766 --> 02:18:53.569]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:18:53.829 --> 02:18:59.191]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:18:59.411 --> 02:19:06.393]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:19:06.693 --> 02:19:12.036]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:19:12.296 --> 02:19:17.019]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:19:17.359 --> 02:19:24.943]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:19:25.243 --> 02:19:25.523]  I think so.
[02:19:39.463 --> 02:19:40.444]  How are you feeling today?
[02:19:40.664 --> 02:19:41.144]  Why ask?
[02:19:41.184 --> 02:19:47.369]  Because if you have health challenges, then reading our free e-booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:52.092]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call Mangosteen.
[02:19:52.393 --> 02:19:58.057]  It's a century-old medicinal fruit whose time has come, and it has amassed 40 years of published research.
[02:19:58.357 --> 02:20:03.441]  We have information and testimonials from all over the world about the health potential of this amazing fruit.
[02:20:03.681 --> 02:20:10.185]  The powerful botanical has contributed to the well-being of millions of people the world over with health concerns just like yours.

[02:20:28.874 --> 02:20:30.354]  Your health is in your hands.

[02:20:32.134 --> 02:20:32.294]  Call 800-658-0597.
[02:20:32.314 --> 02:20:32.614]  Again, that's 800-658-0597.
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:47.101]  Craig Walcott, chartered financial consultant and host of the Dead Doctors Don't Lie radio program, a million-dollar earner in the network marketing field since 1989.
[02:20:47.141 --> 02:20:49.262]  I certainly know what it takes to succeed.
[02:20:49.502 --> 02:20:54.943]  I also know without proper tools, your chance for significant income in the network marketing field can quickly fade.
[02:20:55.143 --> 02:21:01.124]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing will never spend the time nor money to develop the skills they need.
[02:21:01.324 --> 02:21:03.765]  That's where MLM Incorporated steps in.
[02:21:03.965 --> 02:21:06.305]  No matter what network marketing venture you're involved in,
[02:21:06.665 --> 02:21:07.046]  I think so.
[02:21:29.065 --> 02:21:35.231]  Visit MLMincorporated.com to hear how you can become one of the elite income earners in the network marketing field.
[02:21:35.491 --> 02:21:39.035]  MLMincorporated.com, where your success is guaranteed.
[02:21:42.358 --> 02:21:53.409]  We've been getting a lot of emails about the internet cutting out for a minute here, a minute there.
[02:21:54.316 --> 02:21:54.957]  And I'm getting them.
[02:21:55.197 --> 02:21:56.198]  I can't control that.
[02:21:56.238 --> 02:21:57.479]  That's the Genesis Network.
[02:21:58.099 --> 02:21:59.901]  Need to call Ted Anderson listeners.
[02:22:00.681 --> 02:22:02.943]  And they're trying to put in backup internet systems.
[02:22:04.524 --> 02:22:05.505]  C'est la vie.
[02:22:05.705 --> 02:22:06.286]  What do you do?
[02:22:06.786 --> 02:22:08.708]  Convince them it's a problem, they might fix it.
[02:22:09.348 --> 02:22:11.890]  All I know is John Harmon running the show does a fabulous job.
[02:22:12.871 --> 02:22:18.356]  Okay, um... I was ranting and raving about a bunch of things.
[02:22:18.436 --> 02:22:18.776]  It's just...
[02:22:20.060 --> 02:22:22.322]  You want to be prisoners, you want to be feudal serfs.
[02:22:22.402 --> 02:22:23.843]  The system is feudalism.
[02:22:23.883 --> 02:22:35.272]  Go get an encyclopedia, get a history book, read about serfdom and feudalism, and everybody's basically a slave on little bitty pieces of land, micromanaged by a bunch of pot-bellied thugs that work for the nobles.
[02:22:36.713 --> 02:22:38.554]  It's like communism or any other system.
[02:22:38.614 --> 02:22:39.915]  You want to be a Chivano?
[02:22:40.416 --> 02:22:44.479]  You want somebody on every corner telling you what to do, what to eat, what to think?
[02:22:44.899 --> 02:22:47.361]  Bad, bad, bad, like Tony Montana says?
[02:22:47.981 --> 02:22:48.722]  I mean, that's it!
[02:22:49.756 --> 02:22:50.577]  You want that?
[02:22:50.677 --> 02:22:53.078]  You're going to get to be a slave, America.
[02:22:54.879 --> 02:22:57.141]  And, uh, it's just so sick.
[02:22:57.421 --> 02:23:00.203]  The TV ads where they encourage families to rat on each other.
[02:23:00.263 --> 02:23:03.745]  I mean, we're living in Orwellian hell, with criminals running the system.
[02:23:04.386 --> 02:23:08.668]  And if the police and military would just wake up and say, no, we could save this country, but you won't.
[02:23:09.269 --> 02:23:14.212]  You'll go and fight imaginary Al-Qaeda overseas while the government dissolves and merges with Europe.
[02:23:16.414 --> 02:23:17.614]  I got so many clips here.
[02:23:17.694 --> 02:23:18.435]  I've got, uh,
[02:23:19.895 --> 02:23:21.216]  Sky 3 I want to play.
[02:23:22.436 --> 02:23:26.617]  I've got, uh, Oberman I want to play.
[02:23:27.538 --> 02:23:28.718]  What are all the clips I've got?
[02:23:31.939 --> 02:23:34.900]  Oberman, Sky News, and McGovern and Tucker.
[02:23:35.201 --> 02:23:36.581]  Let's play McGovern on Tucker.
[02:23:36.941 --> 02:23:41.043]  Carlson talking about the Yellow Cake forged documents leading back to Haird Shaney.
[02:23:41.843 --> 02:23:43.484]  We'll go ahead and roll that now.
[02:23:43.544 --> 02:23:44.764]  Here it is.
[02:23:44.784 --> 02:23:46.485]  Spoke this morning with Tom Brokaw of NBC.
[02:23:46.525 --> 02:23:47.405]  Here's some of that interview.
[02:23:49.145 --> 02:23:58.372]  I chose to do my job in a way where you stay inside the system, you do your best, you push your objective analysis, you make people aware of what you believe to be true.
[02:23:58.892 --> 02:24:00.914]  While people think, well why are you talking now?
[02:24:00.974 --> 02:24:02.755]  Why have you been silent so long?
[02:24:03.116 --> 02:24:10.261]  I certainly wasn't silent within the purview of my job and in the counsels of the administration in terms of what we said and how we said it.
[02:24:11.764 --> 02:24:21.932]  A memo from the State Department this morning took apart Tenet's accusations one by one, and while the administration predictably defended itself, some of his former colleagues have criticized Tenet for coming forward after the fact.
[02:24:22.492 --> 02:24:24.173]  Where was Tenet when it mattered?
[02:24:24.734 --> 02:24:29.317]  Among those to question Tenet's actions, Leigh McGovern, a long-time CIA employee.
[02:24:29.757 --> 02:24:34.701]  McGovern chaired the National Intelligence Estimates and prepared the President's daily security briefing for many years.
[02:24:35.081 --> 02:24:40.145]  He's also the co-founder of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, and a guest contributor to Truthout.com.
[02:24:40.285 --> 02:24:41.105]  He joins me now.
[02:24:41.125 --> 02:24:42.125]  Mr. McGovern, thanks for coming on.
[02:24:42.185 --> 02:24:43.386]  You're welcome.
[02:24:44.786 --> 02:24:55.408]  This is all about, it seems to me, or at least by Mr. Tennant's account, about the bad reputation he's gotten from using the phrase slam dunk to describe the intelligence leading up to war in Iraq.
[02:24:55.908 --> 02:24:58.289]  I'm not exactly sure, what did he mean by that?
[02:24:58.329 --> 02:24:59.369]  Was he saying he meant by that?
[02:24:59.749 --> 02:25:00.809]  Can you explain that?
[02:25:00.869 --> 02:25:02.970]  He's rather a pathetic figure, actually.
[02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:07.911]  What he's trying to do is justify himself for unjustifiable activity.
[02:25:08.631 --> 02:25:17.159]  Now, everyone thought he meant slam-dunk to mean we have slam-dunk information intelligence that proves that weapons of mass destruction there.
[02:25:17.579 --> 02:25:18.880]  Now he's saying, no, I didn't mean that.
[02:25:19.541 --> 02:25:20.502]  I didn't mean that at all.
[02:25:20.522 --> 02:25:29.770]  What I meant was that if you want to make a public case, Mr. President, we can make a slam-dunk case out of this for you to present to the American people and the Congress.
[02:25:31.380 --> 02:25:31.840]  That's better?
[02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:33.181]  That's a better thing?
[02:25:33.822 --> 02:25:34.622]  Is that his job?
[02:25:34.682 --> 02:25:39.466]  I mean, is that the Director of Central Intelligence's job to explain public relations to the President?
[02:25:39.606 --> 02:25:41.207]  It's not in his job description.
[02:25:41.267 --> 02:25:45.310]  As a matter of fact, it is the antithesis of his job.
[02:25:45.410 --> 02:25:48.512]  The Director of Central Intelligence is supposed to tell it like it is.
[02:25:48.612 --> 02:25:53.176]  He's not supposed to help prepare the President to start an unnecessary war.
[02:25:53.556 --> 02:25:56.358]  A war of aggression, in Nuremberg Tribunal terms.
[02:25:56.778 --> 02:25:57.919]  It doesn't get any worse than that.
[02:25:57.999 --> 02:26:03.823]  That's why he's trying to sort of make amends here and trying to rehabilitate his reputation.
[02:26:03.843 --> 02:26:08.847]  But is his job to make a case or is it just to present the facts as they're known by CIA to the President?
[02:26:09.067 --> 02:26:12.109]  Is he supposed to collect them in such a way that they have a thesis?
[02:26:13.868 --> 02:26:18.073]  Everyone's entitled to their own facts, but their own opinions, but not their own facts.
[02:26:18.474 --> 02:26:20.476]  George Tenet has his own little set of facts.
[02:26:21.558 --> 02:26:24.962]  He's been very disingenuous in how he's presented this.
[02:26:26.043 --> 02:26:31.209]  For example, he claims that the intelligence was not really massaged or
[02:26:31.790 --> 02:26:58.367]  Corrupted by him he claims that he really believed their weapons of mass destruction, but we know from documentary evidence Namely his discussions with the British counterpart sir Richard dear love on the 20th of July 2002 mind you eight months before the war we know that he told dear love that the intelligence was being fixed around the policy There's no gain saying that we have the minutes documentary, but what would be the motive will be his motive in that?
[02:26:58.647 --> 02:27:08.241]  I mean, if in other words, he knew that the war was unjustified and it was a mistake going back four or five years ago, why would he endorse the war knowing that the error would come to light and destroy his reputation?
[02:27:08.621 --> 02:27:12.146]  Well, you know, it wasn't clear that it would destroy anybody's reputation.
[02:27:12.326 --> 02:27:15.391]  He may have been one of those who was convinced that Dick Cheney was right.
[02:27:15.911 --> 02:27:19.312]  That the people in Iraq would greet us with open arms and cut flowers.
[02:27:19.992 --> 02:27:28.634]  And then, with us sitting on top of all that oil, with permanent military bases, making that part of the world even more secure for Israel, who's gonna come around?
[02:27:28.674 --> 02:27:29.575]  Who's gonna come around, I think?
[02:27:31.135 --> 02:27:32.055]  We're on the march.
[02:27:32.536 --> 02:27:34.136]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:34.156 --> 02:27:37.737]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:41.460 --> 02:27:44.161]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[02:27:44.542 --> 02:27:47.543]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[02:27:47.823 --> 02:27:49.884]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?
[02:27:50.205 --> 02:27:54.587]  Now there's SFR Green, performance technologies for a clean planet.
[02:27:54.847 --> 02:28:01.130]  SFR Green's Protector reduces emissions and improves fuel economy, meeting automakers' new standards.
[02:28:01.150 --> 02:28:02.231]  So do something green.

[02:28:11.932 --> 02:28:14.413]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:28:14.893 --> 02:28:16.793]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:28:17.513 --> 02:28:20.674]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:28:21.334 --> 02:28:27.816]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[02:28:41.534 --> 02:28:44.057]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:28:44.738 --> 02:28:54.308]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:28:55.379 --> 02:29:04.926]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:29:05.947 --> 02:29:11.452]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.
[02:29:12.232 --> 02:29:19.978]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:29:24.210 --> 02:29:24.870]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:29:24.910 --> 02:29:25.131]  Call now.

[02:29:41.056 --> 02:29:42.897]  Summer is once again just around the corner.
[02:29:43.277 --> 02:29:45.539]  And as usual, so are higher gas prices.
[02:29:45.999 --> 02:29:49.161]  This year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back.
[02:29:49.621 --> 02:29:57.685]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[02:29:58.646 --> 02:30:00.927]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised,
[02:30:01.387 --> 02:30:05.210]  Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem, unburned fuel.
[02:30:05.651 --> 02:30:09.393]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[02:30:09.854 --> 02:30:14.697]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[02:30:15.098 --> 02:30:21.683]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[02:30:22.303 --> 02:30:23.904]  And, it's so easy to use!
[02:30:24.364 --> 02:30:30.327]  Simply pour a couple of ounces into your tank at every fill-up, and you're on your way to saving money and the environment!

[02:30:37.410 --> 02:30:40.291]  That's ctsavegas.com!
[02:30:43.633 --> 02:30:45.634]  Come, you masters of war!
[02:30:46.874 --> 02:30:49.956]  Here to build the big guns!
[02:30:52.655 --> 02:30:56.819]  All right, we're back live.
[02:31:20.612 --> 02:31:22.512]  It's real simple.
[02:31:22.953 --> 02:31:41.177]  Throughout human history, groups of control freaks who don't want to produce anything, and who like to be the bosses, put on official headdresses and badges and fancy outfits and tell us all that they're our kings, and then they have a bunch of thugs that work for them that come and make us work for them as their slaves.
[02:31:42.296 --> 02:31:45.718]  And humans are always aware of this and fought against it because they love their families.
[02:31:46.078 --> 02:31:50.339]  Now we became fat, dumb, and happy and decadent because of the milk and honey our forebears created.
[02:31:50.860 --> 02:31:52.560]  And now we're going into high-tech bondage.
[02:31:53.561 --> 02:31:56.702]  And the elite are so decadent, they're talking about how they want to mass cull us.
[02:31:57.282 --> 02:32:02.565]  In major publications, Autobahn Society, Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club, UN documents.
[02:32:02.605 --> 02:32:04.806]  I was on a national radio show last week, ManCow.
[02:32:05.266 --> 02:32:10.108]  It's on Talk Radio Network, and I mentioned that UN treaties and documents
[02:32:11.002 --> 02:32:14.504]  Biological Diversity Assessment calls for mass human sacrifice.
[02:32:15.065 --> 02:32:20.888]  It says in the olden times that, I've got it in Rotaterini, by the way, close-ups of the documents.
[02:32:20.928 --> 02:32:22.269]  You can go pull them up online for yourself.
[02:32:22.529 --> 02:32:29.654]  It's at the UN website, un.org, because it is a private group.
[02:32:30.575 --> 02:32:33.076]  And they say in there we need to reinstitute human sacrifice.
[02:32:33.136 --> 02:32:35.958]  I mean, I know that's crazy to say, but I'm not the one that wrote it and said it.
[02:32:36.698 --> 02:32:37.459]  These are complete
[02:32:38.510 --> 02:32:41.153]  Completely insane individuals with genius IQs.
[02:32:41.933 --> 02:32:44.936]  They're totally ruthless and they revel in feeding on you.
[02:32:45.337 --> 02:32:46.778]  And you're not even aware you're being fed on.
[02:32:47.259 --> 02:32:49.601]  And I just sit here watching it in complete and total horror.
[02:32:52.143 --> 02:32:55.086]  Watching my whole world change and watching a prison grid be set up.
[02:32:55.827 --> 02:32:56.928]  Alright, I'm going to take five calls.
[02:32:56.948 --> 02:32:57.629]  I'm going to take them quick.
[02:32:57.649 --> 02:32:58.229]  I always say that.
[02:32:58.269 --> 02:33:01.853]  No matter how good your calls are, I'm cutting you off because I want to play some other audio clips.
[02:33:03.732 --> 02:33:04.372]  I got two quick things.
[02:33:04.393 --> 02:33:05.453]  What do you think about this?
[02:33:14.915 --> 02:33:19.879]  These IEDs, as Fox News calls them here in Austin, being found three of them in the past week.
[02:33:20.159 --> 02:33:26.464]  I mean, it gets kind of, with the NORCOM stuff going on, it's kind of... Yeah, you're talking about pipe bombs being found?
[02:33:27.024 --> 02:33:31.627]  Yeah, and they call them IEDs just to throw that term out in our faces last night on the news.
[02:33:31.647 --> 02:33:33.569]  Yeah, well it's all part of the war.
[02:33:33.629 --> 02:33:35.290]  We're under terror attack.
[02:33:36.631 --> 02:33:40.614]  Looks like some type of provocative action, but you do have some lone nuts out there.
[02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:47.263]  And it's just all the more reason for paramilitary forces to run around swarming like a pack of baboons.
[02:33:48.184 --> 02:33:55.188]  Yeah, I mean they said, you know, in Fox News that they had tracked receipts from Walmart or Target or one of those stores.
[02:33:55.348 --> 02:33:57.329]  Yeah, with the cooler the guy put the bomb in.
[02:33:57.889 --> 02:33:58.130]  Yeah.
[02:33:58.210 --> 02:33:59.210]  I mean, it may well be.
[02:33:59.230 --> 02:34:01.331]  I mean, you know, there are those type of people out there.
[02:34:01.512 --> 02:34:02.132]  What else is on your mind?
[02:34:03.011 --> 02:34:05.914]  Uh, what do you think about Perry's new stance on guns?
[02:34:06.655 --> 02:34:10.599]  Well, he's doing that because he has, you know, an approval rating.
[02:34:10.639 --> 02:34:12.761]  It was 20-something, now it's like 18.
[02:34:13.561 --> 02:34:16.824]  And everybody hates him, and so it's like Bush.
[02:34:16.884 --> 02:34:27.414]  Bush comes out and says, I'm pro-Second Amendment, and then doubles and then triples the sizes of the VATF enforcement to come after gun owners and gun importers and his NRA board member,
[02:34:28.415 --> 02:34:32.176]  Mr. Barr said on this show, Bob Barr, Bush is more anti-gun than Clinton.
[02:34:32.897 --> 02:34:37.278]  But yeah, the legislature is going in the direction of a Vermont style.
[02:34:37.998 --> 02:34:47.582]  But if Perry really cared, he would abolish the concealed carry where you've got to jump through a hundred hoops and put your hands out the windows like you're a criminal when the cop pulls you over and you've got the concealed carry.
[02:34:47.602 --> 02:34:48.302]  Give me a break.
[02:34:48.622 --> 02:34:50.963]  And we just need to have Vermont style concealed carry.
[02:34:51.824 --> 02:34:54.447]  But yeah, Perry calls for gun-toting freedom in Texas.
[02:34:54.867 --> 02:34:57.110]  This is KXAN out of Austin, NBC.
[02:34:57.471 --> 02:35:03.338]  While people across the country have called for gun control in the wake of Virginia Tech, Governor Rick Perry called for gun freedom Monday.
[02:35:04.244 --> 02:35:04.684]  No, that'll do it.
[02:35:04.704 --> 02:35:05.425]  I appreciate it, man.
[02:35:05.445 --> 02:35:05.825]  You take care.
[02:35:28.067 --> 02:35:28.988]  I appreciate your call.
[02:35:29.009 --> 02:35:33.535]  Yeah, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine said he has closed the loophole in state gun laws.
[02:35:33.835 --> 02:35:35.257]  That means you can't have private sales.
[02:35:35.678 --> 02:35:36.619]  It just goes on.
[02:35:39.228 --> 02:35:47.613]  Uh, Cain issued an executive order that requires anyone found to be dangerous and ordered to undergo involuntary mental health treatment to be included on the database of prohibited gun buyers.
[02:35:47.913 --> 02:35:59.139]  But see, they said they're going to put half the children, this is internal, drug company documents, Omni Freedom Initiative, half the kids are going to be adjudicated through their kangaroo courts to be mentally ill so half the population can't own guns.
[02:35:59.359 --> 02:36:01.640]  They'll get the rest of us in the criminal system one way or the other.
[02:36:03.164 --> 02:36:07.487]  Alright, let's go ahead now and take another call.
[02:36:07.547 --> 02:36:12.011]  Let's talk to Rama in San Fran.
[02:36:12.051 --> 02:36:12.851]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:36:13.632 --> 02:36:14.913]  Hey Alex, how's it going man?
[02:36:14.933 --> 02:36:15.793]  Pretty good, what's on your mind?
[02:36:16.554 --> 02:36:32.005]  I was just calling about the freeway part that collapsed down and I drive on those a lot and I just remembered that they always seem like they're with cement on top and not asphalt.
[02:36:33.084 --> 02:36:42.572]  Yeah, I'm just going off of the extension bridge, you know, the overpass that was going into Berkeley, and where it's not even burning, look at the road, there is asphalt on it.
[02:36:43.072 --> 02:36:44.733]  But maybe, maybe it's gray concrete.
[02:36:45.694 --> 02:36:56.562]  Oh yeah, I'm pretty sure it is, but anyways, I found a couple of photos that were much more closer up, and I emailed them over to both of those, Aaron and... Okay, thank you.
[02:36:56.602 --> 02:36:57.363]  What else is on your list?
[02:36:58.323 --> 02:36:59.203]  Uh, no, that was it.
[02:36:59.304 --> 02:37:01.404]  I just wanted to point that out to you guys.
[02:37:01.684 --> 02:37:02.325]  Thanks a lot.
[02:37:02.425 --> 02:37:02.925]  Anything else?
[02:37:03.825 --> 02:37:04.726]  Uh, no, that's it, man.
[02:37:04.766 --> 02:37:05.326]  Thank you, Ron.
[02:37:05.366 --> 02:37:06.186]  I'll check into that.
[02:37:06.266 --> 02:37:06.707]  Thank you.
[02:37:07.067 --> 02:37:09.648]  Uh, I just know these things collapse all the time on their own without fire.
[02:37:10.848 --> 02:37:16.651]  Those overpasses are not Building 7, where the police are saying on tape, we're told to get back, it's going to be blown up by the government.
[02:37:17.351 --> 02:37:18.111]  Open and shut case.
[02:37:18.932 --> 02:37:23.974]  Uh, let's go ahead, I mean, the point is the neocons are saying this proves that all the buildings are going to fall down if you strike a match in them.
[02:37:24.794 --> 02:37:27.095]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to, uh, who's up next?
[02:37:28.786 --> 02:37:30.207]  Justin in Kansas, you're on the air.
[02:37:30.247 --> 02:37:30.607]  Go ahead.
[02:37:30.627 --> 02:37:32.088]  Hi, Alex.
[02:37:32.108 --> 02:37:33.169]  You're exactly right.
[02:37:34.109 --> 02:37:35.090]  You know, things are ruined.
[02:37:35.450 --> 02:37:36.111]  Things are ruined.
[02:37:36.931 --> 02:37:38.292]  We're already living in a police state.
[02:37:38.332 --> 02:37:39.633]  It's not becoming a police state.
[02:37:39.673 --> 02:37:40.333]  It's already there.
[02:37:41.294 --> 02:37:48.198]  The reason I was calling is in November of 2005, I was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease called Wagoner's Granulomatosis.
[02:37:49.299 --> 02:37:53.422]  And basically after about 17 years of suffering, I was told that
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:38:00.801]  You know, it was all in my head by many doctors, and it finally took 12 lung tumors for them to figure out that there was something seriously wrong with me.
[02:38:00.821 --> 02:38:01.962]  Well, listen, sir, it's simple.
[02:38:02.022 --> 02:38:08.363]  First, they socialize the health care, but not for the people, for the big medical corporations that are owned by the insurance companies.
[02:38:08.843 --> 02:38:10.343]  Then they sell you all this.
[02:38:10.363 --> 02:38:14.544]  They sell you on further socialism, which only communalizes it more for them.
[02:38:14.604 --> 02:38:19.325]  And then when you go in dying of DU, or you go in with a huge tumor, I mean, in England, they don't lie.
[02:38:19.345 --> 02:38:20.765]  It's a year and a half for brain tumors.
[02:38:21.085 --> 02:38:22.426]  Average person dies in four months.
[02:38:22.486 --> 02:38:23.106]  Everybody dies.
[02:38:23.126 --> 02:38:23.946]  You don't get any treatment.
[02:38:24.586 --> 02:38:29.088]  Unless, of course, you've got a private system and you're a billionaire, you can still get some treatment for yourself or fly to the U.S.
[02:38:29.508 --> 02:38:34.149]  And so, yeah, now they just tell you you're all mentally ill and give you a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[02:38:35.790 --> 02:38:42.812]  Well, yeah, they did put me on those for depression, but I'm not taking them now.
[02:38:42.852 --> 02:38:48.874]  Hey, listen, I've got family that's in a car wreck and before they leave the hospital, two days later, they say, it's time for you to go on Prozac.
[02:38:49.275 --> 02:38:50.135]  It's just standard, sir.
[02:38:50.155 --> 02:38:52.196]  They mail out millions of samples in the mail.
[02:38:52.276 --> 02:38:53.236]  It's just total control.
[02:38:53.945 --> 02:38:54.185]  Right.
[02:38:54.686 --> 02:39:07.496]  I did six months of chemotherapy and that didn't work, didn't put me in remissions, and then I just recently did two infusions of a new cancer drug, took part in a clinical trial, and that wasn't effective either.
[02:39:08.016 --> 02:39:10.278]  I was wondering if in your travels you have come across any
[02:39:10.936 --> 02:39:15.259]  Anybody who knows of any more holistic type medicines that a person could take?
[02:39:15.799 --> 02:39:17.561]  Yeah, dip it in the mud.
[02:39:17.901 --> 02:39:23.725]  Now, they're going to engineer the bioweapons, and they already are, the cancer trigger viruses.
[02:39:24.425 --> 02:39:26.166]  I wouldn't even call them viruses.
[02:39:26.347 --> 02:39:29.729]  These are nanotech weapons, because a virus does replicate.
[02:39:29.749 --> 02:39:31.370]  It's really naturally occurring nanotech.
[02:39:32.717 --> 02:39:36.880]  I wouldn't, your parents shouldn't have given you the vaccines.
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:46.948]  You probably, I mean again, clear links in massive studies that show Crohn's is directly linked to contaminated vaccines, but they're not contaminated.
[02:39:46.988 --> 02:39:48.369]  Contaminated means it's an accident.
[02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:52.493]  And most of your childhood leukemias are being triggered by this.
[02:39:53.934 --> 02:39:56.236]  And it's a nightmare and it was probably in the shots.
[02:39:57.083 --> 02:39:58.964]  And somehow your body wasn't able to fight it off.
[02:39:59.064 --> 02:40:00.705]  It got a toehold.
[02:40:01.285 --> 02:40:05.047]  I would just go into massive vitamins, minerals, natural things.
[02:40:05.087 --> 02:40:06.928]  I would go into relaxing.
[02:40:07.489 --> 02:40:08.789]  Also, it's shown the brain.
[02:40:08.809 --> 02:40:11.291]  I mean, praying just from a secular view.
[02:40:11.311 --> 02:40:12.832]  And of course, I'm a spiritual person.
[02:40:12.852 --> 02:40:13.452]  I believe in God.
[02:40:13.472 --> 02:40:18.135]  But the point is, from a secular view, even the scientists have been praying works for what the brain believes.
[02:40:18.355 --> 02:40:19.575]  So believe you're going to be healed.
[02:40:19.695 --> 02:40:20.556]  Ask God to heal you.
[02:40:21.416 --> 02:40:22.898]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:40:37.182 --> 02:40:43.266]  In fact, there have been some studies that show, because of doctors cheating, that some types of poison actually work better, but I shouldn't laugh.
[02:40:43.286 --> 02:40:44.307]  I know this is serious for you.
[02:40:44.407 --> 02:40:48.110]  Most of us will be dying by bioweapons induced into us by the enemy.
[02:40:48.670 --> 02:40:53.934]  There's major studies the Rockefellers funded in the 30s to discover this, and then they own the major cancer research facilities and hospitals.
[02:40:54.554 --> 02:40:56.656]  But that's basically it, and I appreciate your call.
[02:40:57.777 --> 02:40:58.077]  You know what?
[02:40:58.097 --> 02:40:59.037]  I've got to stop right there.
[02:40:59.057 --> 02:41:00.238]  I'll try to get to calls if I can.
[02:41:00.278 --> 02:41:01.119]  I said I'd air this.
[02:41:01.159 --> 02:41:03.941]  Were you able to find in my note I sent you, John, when I want to air that from?
[02:41:05.541 --> 02:41:06.202]  I aimed it.
[02:41:06.222 --> 02:41:09.304]  I might have gotten a race last night.
[02:41:09.364 --> 02:41:10.906]  It's a 45-minute long program.
[02:41:10.926 --> 02:41:14.208]  I don't know if we can play it now because I said a specific minute to start it.
[02:41:14.248 --> 02:41:16.790]  I believe I said start it at 32.
[02:41:17.611 --> 02:41:19.172]  I don't know if that will give us time to play it.
[02:41:19.593 --> 02:41:20.754]  Well, let me just set this up.
[02:41:20.814 --> 02:41:25.377]  It's a program called 9-11 and the Evil in America, News Corp in England.
[02:41:25.418 --> 02:41:28.120]  It also aired all over Europe and Asia, I'm told.
[02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:30.642]  In part one they did on the Illuminati,
[02:41:32.643 --> 02:41:35.725]  Luckily, Paul Watson picked up on this because it's a town outside Sheffield.
[02:41:36.606 --> 02:41:45.252]  They do this whole thing about Skull and Bones is real, Bohemian Grove, but at the end they say we're all kooks and nuts and it doesn't exist because they do a setup with a guy who claims he's a member of the Illuminati.
[02:41:45.533 --> 02:41:50.096]  They're going to meet with the guy who's a member of the Illuminati, a member of the Knights Templars, and then he never shows up.
[02:41:50.476 --> 02:41:52.658]  And then they say, okay, it doesn't exist, he didn't show up.
[02:41:53.368 --> 02:42:03.833]  It turns out that the guy that did this has done previous interviews and is a member of the Knights Templars, where they moved there in Northern England, and that his whole family is.
[02:42:03.853 --> 02:42:05.174]  They're the head masons in the town.
[02:42:05.434 --> 02:42:07.775]  So they staged it in the show to make us look stupid.
[02:42:08.767 --> 02:42:19.013]  Uh, in this next piece on 9-11, out of the blue, at the end, the last 10 minutes, they show some really kooky guy who has some machine who's gonna stop the mind control beam from getting him.
[02:42:19.314 --> 02:42:23.136]  Even though there are such things, most people that are into this are schizophrenics.
[02:42:23.436 --> 02:42:26.378]  There's people who feed on them with these magic machines and other things.
[02:42:27.662 --> 02:42:30.465]  You know, they don't have targeted, specific systems to do this.
[02:42:31.185 --> 02:42:35.490]  They do have mass systems that DARPA has admitted, but I don't believe it's currently hooked into the cell towers.
[02:42:35.730 --> 02:42:36.771]  That is, most cell towers.
[02:42:37.271 --> 02:42:41.515]  Though they could use those to camouflage larger arrays later, there is mass mind control.
[02:42:41.756 --> 02:42:46.580]  There are admissions of government programs of serious mind control with conditioning and drugging and drilling.
[02:42:48.019 --> 02:42:59.123]  But just in the middle of a 9-11 discussion, they cut to a guy running around with a van with hundreds of clients in California who are schizophrenics, saving them from the power beams with tinfoil hats.
[02:42:59.883 --> 02:43:05.305]  So they never refute anything real that we say in the program and all the great guests they have.
[02:43:05.846 --> 02:43:12.708]  They just cut to the tinfoil hat crowd, the schizophrenic crowd, and maybe this guy means well.
[02:43:12.748 --> 02:43:12.988]  Who knows?
[02:43:13.028 --> 02:43:14.009]  Maybe he is helping them.
[02:43:14.029 --> 02:43:14.669]  I don't think so.
[02:43:15.419 --> 02:43:16.661]  This is how they discredit us.
[02:43:16.741 --> 02:43:17.903]  It's total straw man.
[02:43:18.243 --> 02:43:19.805]  The most baseless you can imagine.
[02:43:19.845 --> 02:43:20.226]  Here it is.
[02:43:22.361 --> 02:43:30.245]  The type of people that would carry out a 9-11 style attack are the type of ruthless individuals that would kill their grandmother for a stick of bubblegum.
[02:43:30.465 --> 02:43:36.648]  The type of people that would claw and stab their way to the top, which is really the norm in history.
[02:43:36.968 --> 02:43:46.373]  Ruthless individuals that have a mad, passionate desire to control and dominate others almost always get into the seats of power.
[02:43:48.636 --> 02:43:52.899]  The real trouble comes when an outlandish conspiracy theory turns out to be true.
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:54.260]  U.S.
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:58.624]  military documents from the 60s reveal a high-level plot to attack neighboring Cuba.
[02:43:59.785 --> 02:44:05.189]  The attacks were to be justified by a totally staged sinking of a ship blamed on the Cubans.
[02:44:06.886 --> 02:44:10.028]  This is where they explain why the government wants to carry out terror.
[02:44:10.268 --> 02:44:13.190]  People that can't figure this out just aren't looking at the facts.
[02:44:13.310 --> 02:44:20.334]  Hitler, right after being elected, firebombed his own government building, his own Reichstag, and said we've got to have fatherland security to keep him safe.
[02:44:20.675 --> 02:44:24.037]  He then passed laws and then moved against the entire population.
[02:44:24.477 --> 02:44:27.679]  That is now happening here in America.
[02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:33.563]  So, we're now being asked to believe that the darkest side of the American government is behind the attacks on 9-11.
[02:44:34.580 --> 02:44:36.181]  But if it's true, then why?
[02:44:36.682 --> 02:44:38.744]  Why would Americans kill their fellow Americans?
[02:44:39.344 --> 02:44:40.345]  Well, oil.
[02:44:40.785 --> 02:44:42.066]  That's what some theorists are saying.
[02:44:42.607 --> 02:44:45.990]  But to find out what else might be behind it, join me after the break.
[02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:50.634]  The events of 9-11 were so horrific that they're barely understandable.
[02:44:50.874 --> 02:44:54.537]  And that's led to lots of people coming up with theories of their own to try and make sense of it all.
[02:44:55.198 --> 02:45:00.042]  But because the US government is so secretive, the finger of blame usually ends up pointed at them.
[02:45:01.558 --> 02:45:06.042]  Take the World Trade Center Twin Towers for example, the heart of commercial America.
[02:45:06.423 --> 02:45:14.990]  There are numerous stories on the web about how the World Trade Centers were somehow in danger.
[02:45:16.094 --> 02:45:17.855]  Uh, they didn't meet building codes.
[02:45:18.676 --> 02:45:25.479]  Well before 9-11, government agency reports showed that there were serious structural and asbestos problems within the Twin Towers.
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:31.523]  The theory goes that shadowy figures with heavy financial interests had a lot to gain if the towers were destroyed.
[02:45:32.063 --> 02:45:38.607]  One unsubstantiated story goes that one individual alone benefited to the tune of 500 million dollars.
[02:45:39.167 --> 02:45:41.989]  The consensus I've seen is that those buildings
[02:45:42.654 --> 02:45:56.078]  needed to come down before 2025 or they would have posed a hazard and it was just a happy coincidence that the hijackers took them down without any cost to the owners whatsoever.
[02:45:57.118 --> 02:46:03.580]  A multi-million dollar insurance policy including terrorist cover was said to have been taken out several months before 9-11.
[02:46:05.416 --> 02:46:09.317]  Its insurance policy was for at least $3.55 billion.
[02:46:09.777 --> 02:46:16.138]  It is trying to collect for what is called a double occurrence because, you know, it says the towers were hit twice and so forth.
[02:46:16.598 --> 02:46:22.539]  The courts have denied that at first, but it at least stands to collect $3.55 billion for an investment of $15 million.
[02:46:22.999 --> 02:46:33.361]  Well, it may be an insurance scam on some level, but I mean, I think going to the level of not just making the building fall down but having a plane run into it is
[02:46:33.976 --> 02:46:35.202]  Yeah, that's not the area.
[02:46:40.541 --> 02:46:42.121]  It's in the last 10 minutes or so.
[02:46:42.141 --> 02:46:45.142]  Try to fast forward in there and try to find the part last night.
[02:46:45.242 --> 02:46:48.003]  I guess I didn't.
[02:46:48.023 --> 02:46:50.284]  You can watch the whole 45-minute long program.
[02:46:50.664 --> 02:46:51.764]  Create a bunch of confusion.
[02:46:51.784 --> 02:46:54.965]  They said it was said people made money off insurance.
[02:46:55.005 --> 02:46:55.225]  No.
[02:46:55.585 --> 02:46:57.446]  Silverstein made over $5 billion.
[02:46:57.786 --> 02:46:59.406]  And then they say, well, what is it?
[02:46:59.446 --> 02:47:00.427]  Which plan was it?
[02:47:01.007 --> 02:47:01.747]  It wasn't for anyone.
[02:47:02.167 --> 02:47:03.467]  They always try that tactic.
[02:47:03.527 --> 02:47:05.368]  It's a cost-benefit analysis.
[02:47:06.068 --> 02:47:11.572]  They look at what helps them, then they want an attack, they look at what area is best, where they can be owners.
[02:47:12.973 --> 02:47:18.997]  By the way, speak of the devil, News Corp makes a bid for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[02:47:19.057 --> 02:47:22.299]  That'll really allow them to corner the market and manipulate things even further.
[02:47:22.340 --> 02:47:27.103]  Those are the folks giving the Dow Jones Industrial 30, the main global stock indices.
[02:47:27.944 --> 02:47:34.648]  Dow Jones & Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal, said Tuesday it has received an unsolicited bid from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
[02:47:34.668 --> 02:47:39.251]  to buy the company for $60 per share, or $5 billion.
[02:47:39.772 --> 02:47:47.597]  Shares of the financial news publishing company soared after the cable news channel CNBC reported news of the offer earlier Tuesday.
[02:47:48.317 --> 02:47:50.499]  After opening at $37.12, the shares jumped $20.95 or 58% to $57.10.
[02:47:56.323 --> 02:47:56.863]  Doug Boost.
[02:47:57.343 --> 02:48:03.246]  Dow Jones said in a brief statement that its board had received a proposal from News Corp to cash their combination cash and News Corp stock.
[02:48:03.606 --> 02:48:07.187]  And since they got all that Defense Department money, it shouldn't be any problem for News Corp.
[02:48:07.608 --> 02:48:09.608]  It's a Defense Department front, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:09.969 --> 02:48:11.169]  Totally and completely.
[02:48:11.649 --> 02:48:12.309]  Yeah, right.
[02:48:12.390 --> 02:48:15.491]  It's government New World Order banker propaganda.
[02:48:15.931 --> 02:48:17.031]  Right out of the Pentagon.
[02:48:17.352 --> 02:48:18.072]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:23.431 --> 02:48:26.454]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:26.954 --> 02:48:28.896]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:28.956 --> 02:48:35.601]  Since their own popular proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out.
[02:48:35.841 --> 02:48:38.563]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:48:38.824 --> 02:48:42.286]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:48:42.787 --> 02:48:44.508]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:48:45.049 --> 02:48:48.832]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:48:57.293 --> 02:49:02.394]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:49:02.454 --> 02:49:09.756]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:49:09.896 --> 02:49:20.518]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:49:20.738 --> 02:49:25.279]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:49:25.559 --> 02:49:30.560]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:33.701]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:49:33.921 --> 02:49:43.524]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:49:57.293 --> 02:49:59.014]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:49:59.234 --> 02:50:02.937]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:03.257 --> 02:50:05.478]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[02:50:05.999 --> 02:50:12.203]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:50:12.363 --> 02:50:17.266]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:50:17.466 --> 02:50:26.412]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[02:50:57.611 --> 02:51:06.015]  This Pentagon program produced by News Corp is so shoddy and they did it in every part of the series I've seen
[02:51:27.032 --> 02:51:29.854]  I haven't seen, actually it's a five part series, I've seen three of them, I'm in two of them.
[02:51:31.215 --> 02:51:38.080]  But, uh, they just sit there and confuse it and then say it's all confusing and we just need to believe the world has order to it.
[02:51:39.561 --> 02:51:46.947]  And so we make all this up and they always show somebody who is just, you know, driving around in a van saying mind control beams control them.
[02:51:47.828 --> 02:51:54.813]  Nothing to do with 9-11, they just say mind control beams and the cell towers are controlling us and they just laugh at us and that's the end of it.
[02:51:55.133 --> 02:51:56.134]  Play a minute or two of this.
[02:51:59.156 --> 02:52:03.298]  The idea of a malignant big brother government controlling everything is nothing new.
[02:52:04.058 --> 02:52:09.641]  For years there have been claims about secret experiments using mind control techniques to brainwash the population.
[02:52:10.775 --> 02:52:11.856]  There have not been claims.
[02:52:11.916 --> 02:52:13.056]  It's been declassified.
[02:52:13.076 --> 02:52:14.497]  They've had History Channel specials.
[02:52:14.957 --> 02:52:25.223]  Dr. Ewing Cameron had over 10,000 kidnapped subjects or people taken out of facilities where they would completely brainwash them and create, you know, totally programmed people.
[02:52:25.523 --> 02:52:25.823]  Okay?
[02:52:26.003 --> 02:52:26.904]  It's declassified.
[02:52:27.224 --> 02:52:27.804]  Shut up!
[02:52:28.365 --> 02:52:30.786]  Now back to the Pentagon's lies who did all of this.
[02:52:31.386 --> 02:52:35.909]  In the 1930s, there has been an ongoing paid government program
[02:52:36.610 --> 02:52:38.812]  To influence the thoughts.
[02:52:39.192 --> 02:52:45.796]  Can we actually control a person's mind so that we can make him into an unwitting agent?
[02:52:46.357 --> 02:52:48.158]  He'll do what we want him to do.
[02:52:48.558 --> 02:52:52.081]  Admittedly, this sounds like science fiction, but it is technically possible.
[02:52:55.843 --> 02:53:03.729]  Some believe, even now, that these mind-control weapons are hidden in mobile phone towers, and that they use the microwave signals to control your brain.
[02:53:09.847 --> 02:53:15.932]  A private investigator, Roger Tulsa, says he's been helping clients who suffer from these electronic harassment problems.
[02:53:16.732 --> 02:53:17.633]  Testing, one, two, three.
[02:53:17.913 --> 02:53:18.374]  Testing.
[02:53:19.735 --> 02:53:23.538]  By using his own tracking device, he believes he can combat these signals.
[02:53:24.358 --> 02:53:28.181]  This is basically a spectrum analyzer and what it does is a complex radio receiver.
[02:53:29.222 --> 02:53:31.824]  And it gives us the ability to look at all the different... I can't handle any more of it.
[02:53:31.904 --> 02:53:33.005]  I can't handle any more of it.
[02:53:33.045 --> 02:53:34.146]  You can go watch it if you want.
[02:53:34.890 --> 02:53:40.872]  So they've got serious people talking about government mind control, and then they just cut to this guy, who may believe what he's doing.
[02:53:40.892 --> 02:53:45.874]  He just drives around with a spectrum analyzer, and people pay him to be able to isolate them and stop them.
[02:53:45.954 --> 02:53:47.594]  No, no, no.
[02:53:47.714 --> 02:53:53.536]  What the frequency pollution does is mess with all of us, and it isn't so much of a control as it causes problems.
[02:53:54.217 --> 02:53:57.038]  Thousands of studies about cell phones causing brain tumors.
[02:53:57.078 --> 02:53:57.898]  That's not debatable.
[02:53:58.718 --> 02:53:59.739]  Are we going to stop using them?
[02:53:59.819 --> 02:54:00.139]  Am I?
[02:54:00.219 --> 02:54:00.399]  No.
[02:54:00.439 --> 02:54:01.059]  We're going to die.
[02:54:01.099 --> 02:54:01.839]  We're into this.
[02:54:01.879 --> 02:54:02.400]  We're idiots.
[02:54:02.440 --> 02:54:03.100]  We're fools.
[02:54:04.525 --> 02:54:08.647]  But can they have focus beams that make you nauseated or pass out or kill you?
[02:54:08.687 --> 02:54:09.768]  Yeah, that's declassified.
[02:54:10.628 --> 02:54:11.869]  Are they starting to deploy these?
[02:54:12.029 --> 02:54:12.349]  Yes.
[02:54:12.369 --> 02:54:18.492]  Did DARPA write about using cell towers with boosted power to do this a few years ago in the Baltimore Sun?
[02:54:18.652 --> 02:54:19.012]  Yes.
[02:54:19.612 --> 02:54:21.713]  Does that mean it's all going on in mass right now?
[02:54:21.893 --> 02:54:22.134]  No.
[02:54:23.514 --> 02:54:29.217]  I mean, you know, this show will attract schizophrenics and it's really annoying because they'll get me on the street and grab me by the arm and they tell me,
[02:54:29.958 --> 02:54:31.179]  It's always the same thing.
[02:54:31.199 --> 02:54:37.963]  You know, the sun's following me, the moon's following me, the laser beams are shooting me, and I just don't have time for it.
[02:54:38.484 --> 02:54:39.784]  You do need to be on medication.
[02:54:40.585 --> 02:54:45.968]  But, see, because of that, then all the admissions of this stuff going on gets ignored.
[02:54:45.988 --> 02:54:48.730]  Well, I did three hours today.
[02:54:48.750 --> 02:54:51.752]  I never really plug my books or films or the materials we carry.

[02:55:18.372 --> 02:55:20.613]  I didn't get to the Keith Olbermann thing, I will air that tomorrow.
[02:55:21.273 --> 02:55:22.834]  I had a bunch of other audio I didn't air.
[02:55:24.654 --> 02:55:28.316]  We just have to recognize how crazy things have gotten to set about changing it.
[02:55:29.042 --> 02:55:29.883]  That's all I know.
[02:55:29.903 --> 02:55:32.146]  Alright, get out there and take on the New World Order.
