[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.440]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.101 --> 00:00:08.181]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:09.982]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:11.443]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.203 --> 00:00:13.183]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:17.445]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.965 --> 00:00:22.027]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:49.079]  This always happens, some in the past, but it's more and more frequent where in the minutes before I start the broadcast, even though I've been preparing for hours, my head begins to swim as if drunk.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.721]  I mean that figuratively, of course.
[00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:56.424]  Literally, I mean, I don't know what to cover first.
[00:00:57.344 --> 00:01:07.307]  There are so many stories, so many facets to every story, so many personal things I've observed, so many international news pieces, local news pieces.
[00:01:08.607 --> 00:01:14.989]  The frequency, the amount, the quantity of news is just mind-blowing.
[00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:26.553]  The prima facie evidence of a world going to seed of corruption running totally rampant, unleashed,
[00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:36.325]  And that is my task here daily to try to bring the most important guests, the most important issues, the most important topics to you and your family.
[00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:42.128]  We will not talk about Lindsay Lohan drunk in the bushes or throwing up on Oxycontin.
[00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:44.450]  We will not discuss Rush Limbaugh on Oxycontin.
[00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.133]  We are not going to be talking about what does Bill Clinton do or Vicente Fox do, you know, on their vacations.
[00:01:51.914 --> 00:01:55.496]  We talk about the dollar in free fall implosion.
[00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:57.457]  We talk about
[00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:08.035]  Child Protective Services being part of a larger eugenics program set up in the 1920s, seizing children worldwide in an accelerated fashion.
[00:02:08.095 --> 00:02:11.796]  We talk about the sperm count continuing to plunge.
[00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:13.737]  We're talking about cancer exploding.
[00:02:14.197 --> 00:02:21.380]  We're talking about genetically engineered crops, jumping species across the board and even jumping whole families.
[00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:26.922]  Plant to animal, animal to plant,
[00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.334]  Mammal to marsupial to... It's just all off the charts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:39.176]  And this is the verified, documented information.
[00:02:40.797 --> 00:02:43.239]  World taxation is being set up right in front of us.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.784]  Friday night, I turned on the web and went to PrisonPlanet.com and saw a direct link to the United Nations website.
[00:02:54.165 --> 00:02:57.007]  And the headline was that, paraphrasing,
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:24.944]  Ewan is afraid of dollar collapse and the reason I paraphrase is as I sit here getting ready to do the live show my brain kind of kicks up another notch and starts turning on a little more and I go wait a minute I've got this big stack of news here in front of me that I thought was important that just came out today or last night but wait a minute there's that other big stack that's sitting in the easy chair in my home office
[00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:34.118]  Oh, I forgot that one, and wait, I never printed off the stories I read Saturday when I was down at the coast with the family.
[00:03:34.238 --> 00:03:37.258]  Oh my God, there were 10 or 15 incredible stories.
[00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.479]  You see, how do I keep track of it?
[00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.801]  During the break, I'm going to pull up the United Nations story, because that is important.
[00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:51.723]  I'm going to try to lead off with that, but that's just a little picture into my mind of the things I think are important.
[00:03:52.617 --> 00:04:09.850]  Then I want our guest on to talk about what they think is important and then of course I want to take your calls to hear what you think is important because all of us putting our minds together really is really what it's all about and the different angles you take us in because no one person can even behold this system.
[00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.354]  No one person could ever even if they try 15, 16, 17 hours a day could be aware of just one-tenth of the crimes
[00:04:20.632 --> 00:04:21.692]  of the New World Order.
[00:04:21.732 --> 00:04:37.399]  I mean, it's so massive, and that's what's mind-boggling to me, to be able to talk to a neighbor, or talk to somebody, you know, when you're at the local swimming pool taking a swim, or at the grocery store, or at church, and they have no idea about anything!
[00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:45.122]  Not about vaccines, not about the open borders, not about the plunging dollar, not about anything!
[00:04:45.322 --> 00:04:46.002]  Nothing!
[00:04:47.543 --> 00:04:48.543]  Nothing but
[00:04:49.617 --> 00:04:51.238]  They know all about American Idol.
[00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:58.423]  Let me tell you something, American Idol won't feed your children, and it won't save this country, and it won't save this planet.
[00:04:58.703 --> 00:04:59.564]  It's a distraction.
[00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:05.466]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:05:05.527 --> 00:05:06.027]  are located?
[00:05:06.227 --> 00:05:09.630]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:14.555]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:05:14.835 --> 00:05:19.840]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.440]  I think so.
[00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:39.939]  I think so.
[00:06:04.386 --> 00:06:07.570]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.852]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.213 --> 00:06:17.841]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:25.599]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:37.424]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.724 --> 00:06:41.245]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.705 --> 00:06:43.646]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:47.808]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:03.263 --> 00:07:07.384]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:07.624 --> 00:07:09.364]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:09.645 --> 00:07:15.926]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:16.206 --> 00:07:22.328]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:22.588 --> 00:07:24.428]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[00:07:24.708 --> 00:07:24.988]  I think?
[00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:47.745]  We're good to go.
[00:08:05.865 --> 00:08:06.506]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.166 --> 00:08:08.207]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.948 --> 00:08:10.069]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:11.550]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.271 --> 00:08:13.091]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.832 --> 00:08:17.795]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.035 --> 00:08:22.119]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.876 --> 00:08:38.777]  It is June 4th, 2007.
[00:08:38.817 --> 00:08:42.778]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:42.818 --> 00:08:43.878]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:44.438 --> 00:08:46.898]  Here are some of the headlines concerning the dollar.
[00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:47.939]  U.S.
[00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:51.119]  debt could trigger dollar collapse, U.N.
[00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:51.779]  warns.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.560]  Another headline, U.N.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:59.641]  dollar crash must be averted to sustain global economic growth.
[00:09:01.085 --> 00:09:05.368]  Asian countries prepare for possible dollar collapse.
[00:09:06.049 --> 00:09:08.351]  This is the type of news I have in front of me.
[00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:10.793]  Large stack seven.
[00:09:10.853 --> 00:09:16.097]  In fact, during the break I was able, with the help of my crew, to print off four different stories concerning this.
[00:09:18.459 --> 00:09:27.966]  And you can go directly to the United Nations' own website and read the preparatory phase as they
[00:09:30.083 --> 00:09:39.009]  Gear up the public for the dollar's possible collapse, and then they'll say, only the Amero can save us.
[00:09:39.049 --> 00:09:51.056]  See, the EU was so strong, and there was such a problem with the dollar due to it, that we now absolutely must have an American Union to counter the European Union.
[00:09:51.076 --> 00:09:53.317]  Then, of course, there'll be a few years of stability from that.
[00:09:53.918 --> 00:09:58.961]  Then they'll hype up gyrating Amero versus Euro.
[00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:15.355]  Currency rates and currency values, and they'll have a few runs on the market that they orchestrate, as they've done all over the planet with similar scams, and they'll say, oh, the answer is pegging it to a single unit.
[00:10:15.395 --> 00:10:25.740]  You'll still have your Amero, you'll still have your Amero, your Euro, your Asian currency, your African currency, but they'll all be pegged to a certain amount.
[00:10:26.681 --> 00:10:27.582]  How do we know this?
[00:10:27.622 --> 00:10:34.046]  Because the Trilateral Commission told us so, and they run the world's economic policies.
[00:10:34.086 --> 00:10:45.773]  They are the sub-think tank of the Bilderberg Group, made up of the leaders of the Bilderberg Group, but of the economists and the top technicians, and they make the decisions.
[00:10:45.994 --> 00:10:50.957]  The Zbigniew Brzezinski's, the David Rockefeller's, the Henry Kissinger's, the George Shultz's, and others.
[00:10:51.696 --> 00:10:58.677]  And the head economist, whoever, over the central banks in the US, in Japan, in Europe, in England.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:04.221]  And that's what's so amazing is they precondition the public that none of this exists.
[00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:27.948]  They say, there's no elite, there's no elite economists, there's no private banks that run the currency, the currency's backed up by wealth, it's not fiat like you've heard, private banks don't run everything, there's no Bilderberg Group, there's no CFR, it doesn't exist, go back to sleep, and then they publicly write textbooks and policy reports saying they run everything.
[00:11:29.051 --> 00:11:33.333]  But they know that, I don't know, it's probably one-tenth of one percent of one percent.
[00:11:33.393 --> 00:11:47.680]  I mean, it's some infinitesimal number of people actually go read autobiographies of German chancellors and British prime ministers, or actually read Trilateral Commission synopses.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.162]  They don't usually publicly release the full reports.
[00:11:51.242 --> 00:11:54.644]  I mean, they openly say they're going to take everything we've got.
[00:11:55.467 --> 00:11:58.229]  They openly say they're going to have one-child policies.
[00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.832]  They openly say they're going to sterilize us.
[00:12:01.352 --> 00:12:02.853]  They openly say all this.
[00:12:05.736 --> 00:12:17.285]  And that's what you can't get through your little heads, you yuppie punks out there, and the know-it-all leaders of different communities in this society, and the police, and the rest of you.
[00:12:18.727 --> 00:12:20.268]  You think you're part of the system.
[00:12:20.548 --> 00:12:22.290]  You think the system cares about you.
[00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.791]  You think you've got power.
[00:12:24.372 --> 00:12:30.973]  You've only got limited power to render unto your masters and to squeeze the middle class out of existence, fools.
[00:12:32.434 --> 00:12:33.834]  You're being abused as well.
[00:12:34.214 --> 00:12:40.775]  Your children are shot up full of the mercury-filled and DNA-fragment-filled inoculations.
[00:12:43.616 --> 00:12:48.557]  You're drinking the aspartame and it's now in over 9,000 foods and products.
[00:12:50.652 --> 00:12:53.573]  You are drinking the sodium and stannous fluoride.
[00:12:54.013 --> 00:12:56.673]  You are eating with genetically modified foods.
[00:12:58.133 --> 00:13:09.255]  Absolute, total, documented studies by major pharmacological and genetic engineering firms and governments that this stuff is messing us up big time.
[00:13:11.296 --> 00:13:12.676]  But you don't know and you don't care.
[00:13:12.956 --> 00:13:14.716]  You don't want to learn what a chimera is?
[00:13:14.997 --> 00:13:16.297]  You could care less.
[00:13:16.737 --> 00:13:17.257]  Fine!
[00:13:19.671 --> 00:13:23.132]  Just know that you're sowing the seeds of your own destruction.
[00:13:25.633 --> 00:13:26.914]  I'm already digressing here.
[00:13:27.034 --> 00:13:30.535]  It's just, it's mind-blowing.
[00:13:32.136 --> 00:13:40.299]  It's absolutely mind-blowing to see the dollar in retreat.
[00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:42.280]  I mean, I was on Bloomberg Financial
[00:13:44.142 --> 00:13:52.167]  Saturday night, and the headline talked about the peso surging against the dollar.
[00:13:53.388 --> 00:13:58.191]  The peso is moving up several percentage points every week.
[00:13:59.732 --> 00:14:01.973]  I mean, the dollar isn't just dropping.
[00:14:04.314 --> 00:14:06.996]  The peso is going up.
[00:14:12.401 --> 00:14:32.450]  And Bush appoints, or is preparing to appoint, Richard B. Zoellick, the super-globalist, to be the new World Bank head to replace Wolfie Wits, and he was an Enron executive on their board of directors.
[00:14:39.542 --> 00:14:45.426]  Which, by the way, the stuff you saw on national television, you saw on the liberal films, I mean, that's nothing.
[00:14:45.466 --> 00:14:52.470]  Enron was involved in massive narcotics trafficking and money laundering, as any really big corporation is.
[00:14:55.392 --> 00:14:58.534]  And I saw them taking the money out of that two years before it fell in.
[00:14:58.554 --> 00:15:03.838]  I mean, when they're on the news saying, this is the surest stock, buy in now,
[00:15:05.109 --> 00:15:15.575]  Like they said before the Great Depression, when shoeshine boys are given advice on what stock to buy, and they're all parroting and tweeting and chirping and saying the same thing, look out!
[00:15:16.095 --> 00:15:23.680]  Let me just give all the real estate barons, and you think you're barons, you've got a few million in the bank and you own a bunch of properties and you're really ten million in debt leveraged.
[00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:26.962]  You're not going to have nothing when they're done with you.
[00:15:27.042 --> 00:15:28.062]  You think you know it all.
[00:15:28.102 --> 00:15:29.023]  Just enjoy yourselves.
[00:15:29.723 --> 00:15:32.545]  And all of you out there that think you've got it all figured out,
[00:15:34.292 --> 00:15:40.453]  Just keep loving your New World Order, just keep kissing all over it, and keep just believing all of the bull.
[00:15:40.473 --> 00:15:45.855]  Because the chickens are coming home to roost.
[00:15:46.935 --> 00:15:51.796]  Alright, later I'll actually get into the reports here about the plunging U.S.
[00:15:51.856 --> 00:15:52.216]  dollar.
[00:15:53.236 --> 00:15:53.517]  U.S.
[00:15:53.557 --> 00:15:55.577]  debt could trigger dollar collapse, U.N.
[00:15:55.597 --> 00:15:56.077]  warns.
[00:15:57.117 --> 00:16:03.739]  The United States dollar is facing imminent collapse in the face of an unsustainable debt, the United Nations warned today.
[00:16:04.494 --> 00:16:05.134]  You gotta love it.
[00:16:05.675 --> 00:16:27.064]  The people that run the U.S., that own the U.S., that have used us as their nitrous oxide-fueled battering ram, they're just ragging us out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:27.084 --> 00:16:28.905]  They're just tearing us into little pieces.
[00:16:28.925 --> 00:16:32.206]  It'd be like if you had a car, you knew they were gonna scrap.
[00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:47.979]  Two days from now and you'd go out on the country road and the dirt road and just like you were 16 years old again and some junker just driving like a maniac and doing bat turns and running it through fences and driving around in fields and jumping it.
[00:16:51.721 --> 00:16:53.242]  Like you were the Dukes of Hazzard.
[00:16:55.763 --> 00:16:57.064]  You look at every policy
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:05.603]  In World War II, in Vietnam and Korea, they would only serve, the troops would only serve one tour unless they wanted to serve more.
[00:17:06.123 --> 00:17:09.984]  In combat, people are starting their fifth tours.
[00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:11.385]  Fifth tours.
[00:17:13.206 --> 00:17:15.666]  That's right, four years and four months now.
[00:17:18.548 --> 00:17:22.369]  Four years and four months and some of them are starting their fifth tour.
[00:17:26.831 --> 00:17:27.411]  Fifth tour.
[00:17:29.835 --> 00:17:36.898]  Whereas before, maybe 10% of the troops would come back and be basket cases, collapse, be all screwed up.
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.261]  Now they're looking at about 60%.
[00:17:42.601 --> 00:17:45.142]  Those are Army zone numbers starting to come out.
[00:17:45.202 --> 00:17:47.023]  I mean, you're talking, and they're going to be cops too.
[00:17:47.183 --> 00:17:47.604]  Oh yeah.
[00:17:47.904 --> 00:17:49.885]  They're going to go nuts on the side of the road.
[00:17:50.745 --> 00:17:53.647]  They're going to beat the daylights out of your wife and child.
[00:17:53.687 --> 00:17:58.469]  They're going to, they're going to pull their gun out thinking they're back at a checkpoint under fire.
[00:17:59.284 --> 00:18:02.207]  They're gonna have flashbacks on us and it ain't gonna matter.
[00:18:03.247 --> 00:18:05.169]  It'll all be kept real quiet.
[00:18:05.529 --> 00:18:08.752]  Or the feds will come in and federalize the local cities.
[00:18:08.772 --> 00:18:10.614]  They're getting ready to do that here in Austin.
[00:18:10.914 --> 00:18:12.415]  We're now into phase one of that here.
[00:18:13.816 --> 00:18:19.661]  After the feds give us the training and teach the police how to have instinctive firing that causes the problems.
[00:18:22.744 --> 00:18:26.127]  The military shoot to kill, instinctive killing training.
[00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:27.428]  That's what it's really called.
[00:18:28.769 --> 00:18:35.936]  It was developed in the early 1960s in army psychological warfare dens around the U.S.
[00:18:36.817 --> 00:18:38.238]  All declassified, by the way.
[00:18:38.899 --> 00:18:40.220]  Yes, the police have been trained.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:47.868]  What do you think all those rubber bullets are in the black uniforms and why the cops get orders to shoot at peaceful crowds most of the time?
[00:18:49.229 --> 00:18:52.212]  That's conditioning for the police to be trained to open fire with
[00:18:54.372 --> 00:18:57.493]  Lethal weapons, by the way, they're not really called non-lethal.
[00:18:57.513 --> 00:18:59.293]  The weapons they use are called less lethal.
[00:18:59.573 --> 00:19:01.034]  They kill people routinely with them.
[00:19:03.394 --> 00:19:05.315]  But they tell you it's non-lethal.
[00:19:05.335 --> 00:19:09.016]  But the point is, the weapon is designed to be lethal.
[00:19:10.476 --> 00:19:11.636]  Full metal jacket.
[00:19:13.137 --> 00:19:13.977]  Salvos.
[00:19:14.937 --> 00:19:16.637]  Busting a cap in your hind end.
[00:19:17.078 --> 00:19:19.098]  Like the Mexican cops do routinely.
[00:19:19.598 --> 00:19:22.919]  Protests get out of hand, they just walk right up to the front line where the border's at.
[00:19:24.011 --> 00:19:31.553]  Open fire with a little handgun or rifle, shoot 10 or 15 people, and the protests break up real quick.
[00:19:35.894 --> 00:19:45.877]  And it's to train the public, psychologically, to see the image of guns firing big flashes of red flame injecting out of their black ports.
[00:19:47.597 --> 00:19:48.978]  Fired by their ringwraiths.
[00:19:51.799 --> 00:19:53.219]  I'll get into the news when we get back.
[00:19:53.886 --> 00:19:55.567]  Your calls are coming up as well today.
[00:19:55.587 --> 00:19:56.587]  A lot of news.
[00:19:56.607 --> 00:19:59.328]  Stay with me.
[00:20:02.629 --> 00:20:04.690]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:14.233]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:21.876]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.586 --> 00:20:28.089]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:39.416]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.257]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.361]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:22:04.701 --> 00:22:07.482]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:22:07.742 --> 00:22:11.905]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:22:12.325 --> 00:22:13.165]  So what do you do?
[00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:18.048]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:22:18.528 --> 00:22:20.650]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.031]  Sheltering in Place.
[00:22:22.451 --> 00:22:26.174]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[00:22:26.474 --> 00:22:35.841]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:23:02.192 --> 00:23:03.353]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[00:23:03.373 --> 00:23:05.514]  I'm the Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:23:05.894 --> 00:23:08.875]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:23:08.936 --> 00:23:09.616]  is a real thing.

[00:24:10.057 --> 00:24:15.140]  They railed against the crown, another red tag band.
[00:24:16.374 --> 00:24:18.976]  We're free today!
[00:24:19.056 --> 00:24:24.819]  The last vestiges of freedom are running down
[00:24:46.628 --> 00:24:53.111]  Let me read the news I have just in front of me.
[00:24:53.171 --> 00:24:55.432]  Let me just read you the headlines here.
[00:24:56.033 --> 00:24:57.893]  We already briefly covered U.S.
[00:24:57.953 --> 00:24:59.414]  debt could trigger dollar collapse.
[00:24:59.834 --> 00:25:00.175]  The U.N.
[00:25:00.215 --> 00:25:01.995]  warns, when again, the U.N.
[00:25:02.015 --> 00:25:03.156]  was set up by the very same
[00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:23.355]  People that control our nation and have literally just been using us as their tool, and all they do is hold an American flag in front of our face and say it's for this, and the people yell, alright, let's do it, take all my freedoms, let's go kill somebody in a part of the world I can't even find on a map.
[00:25:24.855 --> 00:25:27.436]  Here's the headlines in front of me today, just some of them.
[00:25:28.356 --> 00:25:30.397]  Shin Bet involved in a 1976 hijacking.
[00:25:33.306 --> 00:25:45.397]  I've already seen some information showing this, and Israel has admittedly been caught blowing up hotels to blame it on Arabs, and attacking ships to try to blame it on Arabs, and the list goes on.
[00:25:45.417 --> 00:25:49.280]  They were caught just four years ago, Jerusalem Post, Haratz.
[00:25:49.641 --> 00:25:51.202]  That's not Alex Jones reporting that.
[00:25:51.642 --> 00:25:53.184]  That's the big Israeli papers.
[00:25:54.302 --> 00:26:00.228]  uh... that uh... the government was creating a headline fake al-qaeda groups and staging attacks.
[00:26:00.348 --> 00:26:01.809]  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm giving you background.
[00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.512]  This is the Jerusalem Post!
[00:26:06.194 --> 00:26:07.655]  Jerusalem Post!
[00:26:07.715 --> 00:26:11.979]  Now, if I report on this, the ADL will probably say that I'm a Klan leader or something.
[00:26:12.119 --> 00:26:13.520]  I'm not, I'm against the Klan.
[00:26:13.981 --> 00:26:17.104]  I've protested them, but this is the Jerusalem Post.
[00:26:18.818 --> 00:26:24.382]  Shin Bet involved in 1976 hijacking.
[00:26:24.402 --> 00:26:27.765]  Remember the big famous one with Idi Amin?
[00:26:30.947 --> 00:26:35.710]  And of course one branch of the Israelis didn't know about this and they sent in them to die.
[00:26:39.213 --> 00:26:40.594]  So that's how government does it.
[00:26:40.634 --> 00:26:45.657]  It isn't the whole government in Israel or Germany or the U.S.
[00:26:45.697 --> 00:26:46.458]  or anywhere else.
[00:26:48.647 --> 00:26:50.949]  It's Select Cadres.
[00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.212]  We'll be going over this report.
[00:26:53.252 --> 00:26:59.057]  Also, we'll get into GOP head.
[00:26:59.137 --> 00:27:03.582]  We need more attacks on American soil so people appreciate Bush.
[00:27:03.662 --> 00:27:06.004]  Now, why is he saying that?
[00:27:07.525 --> 00:27:12.030]  Because it's in a Republican Party memo of two years ago.
[00:27:12.751 --> 00:27:18.995]  We were able to get a Republican Party memo saying this is a national memo for the Republican Party leadership.
[00:27:20.756 --> 00:27:24.158]  This is why we've seen so many Republicans say it live on Fox and CNN.
[00:27:24.238 --> 00:27:27.039]  And that's why they continue to.
[00:27:27.099 --> 00:27:28.120]  It is a talking point.
[00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:31.122]  But you see, they're being honest with you here.
[00:27:31.142 --> 00:27:33.603]  They need terror attacks.
[00:27:34.764 --> 00:27:39.427]  Am I saying this individual, the Republican Party of Arkansas is involved?
[00:27:40.087 --> 00:27:41.188]  No, I'm not saying he is.
[00:27:41.228 --> 00:27:41.828]  Probably not.
[00:27:43.315 --> 00:27:44.936]  Arkansas is a pretty darn corrupt state.
[00:27:45.556 --> 00:27:47.937]  No, I'm just, this is the stuff that's talked about.
[00:27:47.977 --> 00:27:53.199]  I mean, the people running the government, the Democrats, Republicans, both, they know this terror is good for business.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:28:12.667]  This is good for when they're CPSing your child, or checkpointing you, or taking your house, and they just say, it's 9-11, it's a new America, we've got to have secret handovers of 8,000 miles of Texas roads to foreign Spanish companies in secret because of Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:13.843 --> 00:28:14.783]  And they actually say that!
[00:28:14.843 --> 00:28:15.964]  Everything's Al-Qaeda!
[00:28:18.125 --> 00:28:21.787]  Yeah, we're going to devalue your dollar and run the debt up until the whole economy implodes.
[00:28:21.847 --> 00:28:23.047]  It's to fight Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:24.068 --> 00:28:29.850]  Yeah, we're going to go in and kill a bunch of innocent people, over three million of them in total, the five Muslim extremists that we put into power.
[00:28:31.331 --> 00:28:35.693]  GOP head, we need more attacks on American soil so people appreciate Bush.
[00:28:35.733 --> 00:28:36.633]  That's a nice headline.
[00:28:37.894 --> 00:28:40.755]  This is all up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:28:42.429 --> 00:28:44.871]  And then the really big report by Paul Watson today.
[00:28:44.911 --> 00:28:47.332]  You know, I spent hours this weekend studying this.
[00:28:47.932 --> 00:28:49.393]  It broke, of course, on Friday.
[00:28:50.394 --> 00:28:58.979]  And it fits every earmark, every telltale sign, every signature, every wavelength, the entire MO of Shake and Bake, how they do this.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.580]  It's like buying Bisquick.
[00:29:01.481 --> 00:29:01.961]  Shake and Bake.
[00:29:04.663 --> 00:29:09.926]  JFK Airport plot has all the hallmarks of stage terror.
[00:29:12.941 --> 00:29:14.242]  It's like it has all the hallmarks.
[00:29:14.282 --> 00:29:18.806]  You know, if you buy a Betty Crocker box, it has all the hallmarks of a store-bought box cake.
[00:29:18.866 --> 00:29:20.647]  I mean, it's just, you know, it's a box cake.
[00:29:20.667 --> 00:29:24.310]  So when we get back, I'm going to go over this.
[00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:26.652]  I'm going to go over GOP head.
[00:29:26.712 --> 00:29:29.174]  We need more attacks on American soil.
[00:29:30.495 --> 00:29:32.837]  So you can waddle around and be a hero, huh boy?
[00:29:34.158 --> 00:29:37.100]  It's like they always catch bad firefighters setting fire to stuff.
[00:29:37.841 --> 00:29:39.362]  Bad cops planting pipe bombs.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.402]  Shin Bet involved in 1976.
[00:29:44.202 --> 00:29:46.104]  High jacking.
[00:29:47.325 --> 00:29:50.787]  And the stack just gets, well, frankly worse from there.
[00:29:51.647 --> 00:29:52.588]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.048 --> 00:29:54.669]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.252]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:04.037 --> 00:31:05.277]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:31:05.517 --> 00:31:08.338]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:31:08.718 --> 00:31:11.459]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?

[00:33:05.992 --> 00:33:26.578]  Riders on the storm Riders on the storm Into this house we're born Into this world we're thrown Like a dog without a bone
[00:33:29.327 --> 00:33:32.650]  His brain is squirming like a toad.
[00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.932]  If you give this man a ride,
[00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:00.531]  Alright, I'm torturing you singing along.
[00:34:00.551 --> 00:34:04.193]  I think this song says it all though.
[00:34:04.573 --> 00:34:05.953]  Take a long holiday.
[00:34:07.914 --> 00:34:09.134]  Let your children play.
[00:34:09.414 --> 00:34:16.657]  Folks thought after World War II they could stop being involved in government.
[00:34:16.697 --> 00:34:17.617]  They could just turn loose.
[00:34:17.677 --> 00:34:20.338]  We were the good guys and take long holidays.
[00:34:22.091 --> 00:34:25.053]  They gave us Vietnam, staged event, led to that in 64.
[00:34:25.333 --> 00:34:28.515]  They gave us Korea before that.
[00:34:28.535 --> 00:34:30.196]  They gave us so many other horrible things.
[00:34:30.216 --> 00:34:36.340]  They engineered the yippie and hippie movement by shipping in the drugs and handing out the LSD.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.341]  The government did.
[00:34:42.563 --> 00:34:48.507]  They engineered the feminist movement to break up men and women so the state could get the children.
[00:34:52.142 --> 00:34:56.003]  They do everything they can to make sure we're not strong so they can get control of us.
[00:34:57.664 --> 00:35:00.385]  That is the name of the game.
[00:35:00.405 --> 00:35:03.626]  Alright, I'm going to be taking your calls here in a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:35:03.646 --> 00:35:03.706]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:35:03.726 --> 00:35:05.947]  We have a new sponsor that I've been aware of for many years.
[00:35:05.967 --> 00:35:06.407]  It is literally
[00:35:19.389 --> 00:35:19.850]  That's right.
[00:35:38.206 --> 00:35:39.366]  I also have water filters.
[00:35:40.027 --> 00:35:41.287]  I also have firearms.
[00:35:41.307 --> 00:35:45.949]  I also have a couple places to get away to, just in case I need to.
[00:35:45.969 --> 00:35:47.329]  It's not that I'm living in fear.
[00:35:47.369 --> 00:35:51.370]  No, I'm living, I'm trying to live with more control.
[00:35:51.971 --> 00:35:54.551]  I'm trying to be a good steward and protect my family.
[00:35:56.052 --> 00:35:59.193]  I'm trying to do my job to protect my family.
[00:36:00.573 --> 00:36:02.374]  And if it's correct, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:36:04.046 --> 00:36:08.007]  Is the biggest storable foods company in the United States.
[00:36:08.588 --> 00:36:10.288]  It is the longest running.
[00:36:10.308 --> 00:36:14.389]  You've probably heard them advertised on national radio, Coast to Coast AM.
[00:36:15.289 --> 00:36:16.170]  They are the name.
[00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:19.551]  They have high quality foods, not with a bunch of fillers or junk.
[00:36:20.411 --> 00:36:22.831]  And they don't just have, you know, food to get prepared.
[00:36:22.871 --> 00:36:28.793]  They have also strategies and ideas and a lot of free information on their website about getting prepared in general.
[00:36:29.993 --> 00:36:31.494]  And we do this because
[00:36:33.197 --> 00:36:34.278]  We want to be in control.
[00:36:35.638 --> 00:36:38.760]  And you saw what happened in New Orleans, what happens when you're not in control.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:46.423]  So give them a call, and get a free catalog, or find out about getting a supply of food at 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com, that's efoodsdirect.com, 1-800-409-5633,
[00:37:02.466 --> 00:37:05.527]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:37:05.547 --> 00:37:14.589]  You can see a big banner on the right-hand side to the site if you missed that address, but I really believe in what they're doing, and I think you should get storable food from Steve Schenck.
[00:37:14.609 --> 00:37:19.230]  800-409-5633. eFoods Direct.
[00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:30.572]  Also, if you want to support us here on the air and what we're doing, you support our sponsors, A,
[00:37:31.953 --> 00:37:43.686]  You can also spread the word about the show, about the free podcast at InfoWars.com, which anybody can subscribe to for free, served out each day to your MP3 player or iPod.
[00:37:44.547 --> 00:37:47.270]  Also, we restream the show 21 hours a day.
[00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:48.772]  It's live 11 to 2 Central.
[00:37:50.013 --> 00:37:50.834]  That's noon to 3 Eastern.
[00:37:54.426 --> 00:37:57.327]  Restream it out, 21 hours a day after that.
[00:37:57.367 --> 00:37:58.868]  So also spread the word about the show.
[00:37:59.148 --> 00:38:00.108]  That's how we grow.
[00:38:00.428 --> 00:38:01.729]  That's how we reach more people.
[00:38:01.789 --> 00:38:08.071]  And I want to truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank all the people out there that have been spreading the word about the transmission.
[00:38:08.411 --> 00:38:10.652]  That's how we're having a big effect and God bless you.
[00:38:11.572 --> 00:38:15.193]  I mean, if we're going to fight this New World Order, we might as well just go for broke.
[00:38:19.755 --> 00:38:21.135]  And we are going for broke here.
[00:38:21.335 --> 00:38:22.315]  We don't have a choice.
[00:38:22.476 --> 00:38:23.576]  These people mean business.
[00:38:24.617 --> 00:38:29.738]  They are literally devilish creatures who come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:38:31.379 --> 00:38:36.120]  And in closing, if you want to become a PrisonPlanet.tv member, it is 15 cents a day.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.640]  Super high quality downloads.
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:44.882]  We've really upped the quality, and as new systems come out, new technologies come out, we'll even make it higher quality.
[00:38:45.422 --> 00:38:49.163]  I mean, it's light years ahead of some of my videos you'll find on Google Video and Places.
[00:38:49.183 --> 00:38:51.664]  15 cents a day, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:38:54.315 --> 00:38:55.456]  All 15 of my films.
[00:38:56.817 --> 00:39:00.020]  Terror Storm second edition, well really it's the final cut.
[00:39:00.981 --> 00:39:10.669]  You want to get technical, I had an emergency release because we had the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium coming up and I had like a rough cut that wasn't even finished that I showed there.
[00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:13.972]  We put out a couple thousand DVDs of that at the event.
[00:39:15.013 --> 00:39:15.934]  Some of you got those.
[00:39:16.815 --> 00:39:20.358]  And then I put out the real first edition that we call second edition.
[00:39:21.685 --> 00:39:24.866]  And now we have the final cut, 17 extra minutes.
[00:39:25.466 --> 00:39:26.866]  I now have it here in my studio.
[00:39:26.926 --> 00:39:27.786]  It got delivered.
[00:39:28.586 --> 00:39:34.728]  I now have it, but we're not going to release it because the distributor is going to have it in stores until at least mid-July.
[00:39:36.008 --> 00:39:44.890]  And so it is sitting here, but a couple weeks before it's released in stores, it will be available at PrisonPlanet.tv, as promised.
[00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:50.391]  All of my films, weeks before they're released, at PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[00:39:55.462 --> 00:40:00.909]  And speaking of Terror Storm, the first real edition, or what you call second cut, the final cut is coming out.
[00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.373]  It is available, only a couple hundred left.
[00:40:04.433 --> 00:40:05.434]  It is almost gone.
[00:40:05.815 --> 00:40:13.344]  Terror Storm, the first edition, first official edition.
[00:40:14.543 --> 00:40:16.264]  is available right now.
[00:40:16.284 --> 00:40:20.686]  It's still available on Amazon.com as well, but it's almost gone.
[00:40:20.726 --> 00:40:28.589]  If you get it from us at InfoWars.com, we will send a signed card with each DVD that is sold.
[00:40:30.948 --> 00:40:40.992]  So again, Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv or call to order the films I've made or any other books and videos I carry, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:40:41.212 --> 00:40:46.514]  And I said last but not least, but I'm going to add this, support our Aminathem affiliates, support their local sponsors,
[00:40:58.726 --> 00:41:15.284]  They're great stations with a lot of courage and a lot of love of liberty and they're just absolutely amazing from KLBJ 590 here in Austin to KCXL in Kansas City to WBCR in Tennessee and the Sunshine Network in upstate New York, all of them.
[00:41:16.554 --> 00:41:19.655]  I have a tendency just to plug stations I've had for 6, 7, 8, 9 years.
[00:41:19.695 --> 00:41:28.956]  There's so many others in Southern California, and Ohio, and Illinois, and Florida, and Wyoming, and Utah.
[00:41:29.136 --> 00:41:30.877]  I mean, I can't list all the stations.
[00:41:31.357 --> 00:41:35.558]  You're wonderful, you're awesome, you're fantastic, and I love you.
[00:41:41.079 --> 00:41:42.439]  You're just fantastic.
[00:41:43.158 --> 00:41:45.480]  Alright, let me just briefly hit on some of the news.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:50.644]  Jim Mars is coming up in the next hour to talk about just kind of a review.
[00:41:50.864 --> 00:41:55.447]  We cannot just blaze over the huge 9-11 developments that have come out.
[00:41:55.488 --> 00:41:57.029]  The huge JFK and 9-11.
[00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:00.171]  Just all of it together.
[00:42:00.211 --> 00:42:04.154]  All the 9-11, all the JFK, all of it that is coming out right now.
[00:42:05.755 --> 00:42:06.836]  Just a host of issues.
[00:42:06.916 --> 00:42:09.858]  Where Jim Mars sees that we're going in the future.
[00:42:11.159 --> 00:42:11.740]  Great guy.
[00:42:13.189 --> 00:42:16.712]  Salty journalist, you know, of the old mold type.
[00:42:16.752 --> 00:42:17.692]  He's coming up.
[00:42:18.813 --> 00:42:20.274]  Let me just get into this right now.
[00:42:20.374 --> 00:42:24.697]  JFK Airport plot has all the hallmarks of staged terror.
[00:42:26.359 --> 00:42:28.760]  Now, number one, there's always an informant in the midst.
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:32.603]  Then you always learn that the informant is leading the group.
[00:42:33.624 --> 00:42:34.925]  Now, that's called entrapment.
[00:42:34.985 --> 00:42:36.946]  That's called provocateuring.
[00:42:40.209 --> 00:42:41.710]  Then, months later, you learn that
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:54.749]  In some cases, no one ever talked about any terror, no one ever said anything, except maybe after a mosque meeting, yeah, we ought to kill a bunch of them bastards.
[00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:56.170]  Yes, we are.
[00:43:17.751 --> 00:43:38.622]  They're on food stamps, living on the streets, you know, they just got kicked out of home, or mama died, or they're on welfare for being retarded, and the government, the FBI, buys them a warehouse, and buys them camouflage uniforms, and uses a local black leader informant who's been in the community for three decades to totally nail them to the wall.
[00:43:39.603 --> 00:43:43.805]  They're Christian groups, and by the time they're done with them, it's the army of Al-Qaeda.
[00:43:45.521 --> 00:43:51.723]  It's always the same MO, different variants of provocateuring, and this again.
[00:43:52.883 --> 00:43:54.943]  It's always a plot that went on for years.
[00:43:55.024 --> 00:43:57.264]  It's always a plot that wasn't going to be executed.
[00:43:57.304 --> 00:44:02.866]  It's always... And then they hype it up, and then there's always somebody on the loose.
[00:44:03.366 --> 00:44:08.207]  Somebody who came by to one of the mosque meetings, and you know, the government knows right where he's at.
[00:44:09.622 --> 00:44:18.705]  They'll hype it up and have APBs out so there's there's some reality to it you know teletypes coming in and printouts and guys are stopping and women are stopping in the
[00:44:19.538 --> 00:44:27.023]  At the local police barracks, and they stop and look, and then, oh, they're on the lookout, be on the lookout for the Muslim terrorists.
[00:44:27.043 --> 00:44:32.045]  Meanwhile, there's illegal aliens running all around them, and Muslims running all around them, and have come across the border.
[00:44:32.065 --> 00:44:33.186]  They're told to ignore all them.
[00:44:33.666 --> 00:44:40.130]  It's to give some semblance of reality to the butchering of America that's going on in the name of security.
[00:44:41.751 --> 00:44:44.993]  JFK Airport plot has all the hallmarks of stage terror.
[00:44:46.794 --> 00:44:48.375]  Near-retarded ringleader,
[00:44:49.548 --> 00:45:13.063]  Paid government provocateurs, mirrors legions of previous cases, an alleged plot to blow up fuel tanks, terminal buildings and fuel lines running beneath Kennedy International Airport, has all the hallmarks of being another stage terror alert, having never advanced beyond a rudimentary planning stage, while being prodded and provocateured by a paid government informant.
[00:45:15.564 --> 00:45:27.734]  In every single major terror sting we have researched in the West since 9-11, not one single plot has been absent the ingredient of a government provocateur.
[00:45:28.794 --> 00:45:37.061]  Save the cases that were outright manufactured by imaginative government propagandists in allegiance with the entire corporate media.
[00:45:37.081 --> 00:45:42.045]  And because I want to take your calls, we've got a guest coming up, I will finish this story in the third hour.
[00:45:42.085 --> 00:45:42.885]  I'm putting it in the stack.
[00:45:42.925 --> 00:45:43.566]  It will be covered.
[00:45:50.461 --> 00:45:53.964]  Here's the headline, informant helped bust alleged JFK plot.
[00:45:54.324 --> 00:45:57.926]  Giuliani, JFK plot proves I should be president.
[00:45:57.987 --> 00:45:58.967]  Yes, yes.
[00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:04.852]  But let me get to this story first.
[00:46:09.055 --> 00:46:14.118]  GOP head, we need more attention on American soil so people appreciate Bush.
[00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:17.721]  See, there they are right there saying, there's the motive and it's in a top
[00:46:19.145 --> 00:46:22.948]  Republican strategy memo from two years ago.
[00:46:23.208 --> 00:46:25.650]  So, of course, he's out parroting this today.
[00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:39.720]  In his first interview as the chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party, Dennis Milligan told a reporter that America needs to be attacked by terrorists so the people will appreciate the work that President Bush has done to protect the country.
[00:46:41.701 --> 00:46:43.603]  And I've heard these guys call the national shows.
[00:46:44.843 --> 00:46:46.945]  And, see, it just goes one more step, though.
[00:46:47.569 --> 00:46:51.090]  Well, it's a greater threat to Muslims, and that's why we're doing this, to stop them.
[00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:55.771]  We'll stage a few attacks, and we'll blow up a ship, we'll attack a ship.
[00:46:55.831 --> 00:47:02.252]  Well, you know, we'll attack our own ship, and the communist threat is so great in North Vietnam.
[00:47:05.692 --> 00:47:14.234]  We've got to sink the liberty to blame it on Egypt, and we've got to turn back the air cover, because our little ally Israel is in trouble.
[00:47:15.951 --> 00:47:35.534]  At the end of the day, I believe fully the President is doing the right thing, and I think all we need is some attacks on American soil, like we had on 9-11, Milligan said to the Arkansas Democratic Gazette, and the naysayers will come around very quickly to appreciate not only the commitment for President Bush, but the sacrifice that has been made by men and women to protect this country.
[00:47:37.095 --> 00:47:44.276]  He is the new chairman-elect of the Arkansas Republican Party just two weeks ago told the newspaper that he is 150% behind Bush's war on Iraq.
[00:47:48.894 --> 00:47:54.598]  Now, there's your motive right there.
[00:47:56.339 --> 00:47:58.200]  And everybody needs to know that that is the plan.
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:06.145]  I've heard Michael Savage say, Michael Wiener Savage, the Beat Nick poet, say that America is going to be attacked
[00:48:09.824 --> 00:48:13.885]  And that when it happens, everybody that was against the war is going to be put in forced labor camps.
[00:48:14.346 --> 00:48:15.786]  He actually says forced labor camps.
[00:48:16.146 --> 00:48:19.067]  Because he says we're lazy and we'll just get fat in the wonderful prison.
[00:48:19.607 --> 00:48:22.328]  And these things are like Hilton's or something.
[00:48:22.768 --> 00:48:24.349]  And he said like fancy hotels.
[00:48:24.409 --> 00:48:26.430]  And so it needs to be work camps.
[00:48:29.871 --> 00:48:31.551]  And Michelle Malkin writes books about it.
[00:48:31.591 --> 00:48:32.972]  You know she's on government payroll.
[00:48:35.113 --> 00:48:36.733]  So they're not playing games, folks.
[00:48:36.773 --> 00:48:38.254]  They're moving ahead with this.
[00:48:38.514 --> 00:48:38.894]  Of course,
[00:48:41.357 --> 00:48:42.698]  Here is the Jerusalem Post!
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:50.564]  We'll come back and take calls in this next segment, and then the next segment after that, and then get Jim on about 10 or 15 after.
[00:48:51.205 --> 00:48:55.508]  Shin Bet involved in 1976 hijacking.
[00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:10.981]  The Shin Bet, Israeli security agency, may have been involved in the hijacking of an Air France plane in 1976 by Palestinian terrorists, according to newly declassified British government documents released Friday.
[00:49:12.885 --> 00:49:24.027]  Some 100 passengers were held by hijackers at the Enebi Airport in Uganda during an eight-day ordeal that concluded with General Staff Reconnaissance Unit.
[00:49:26.187 --> 00:49:29.248]  Troops stormed the building where the captains were held.
[00:49:30.008 --> 00:49:32.228]  Again, that was Benjamin Yizhenya, whose brother died in that.
[00:49:32.268 --> 00:49:35.409]  Of course, they don't... didn't let him know it was a stage deal.
[00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:41.250]  24 people died in the shootout, including three hostages, 20 Ugandans, and the commander of the rescue team
[00:49:42.447 --> 00:49:49.870]  Yoni Netanyahu, brother of the current Likud head, Benjamin Netanyahu, who now likes to pop up with Giuliani everywhere there's a body.
[00:49:51.531 --> 00:50:02.616]  The hijackers from the Popular Front of Liberation of Palestine and the German Bader Meinhof gang demanded the release of the Palestinian prisoners.
[00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:12.944]  Well, according to newly released documents, the Shin Bet and the PFLP are alleged to have teamed up in an unholy alliance in an attempt to change foreign policy in the Middle East.
[00:50:12.984 --> 00:50:24.228]  And it goes on to say the radical Muslims didn't want detente because they want a war, and the Israelis didn't want detente either because of all the profits and the billions in aid they get.
[00:50:24.929 --> 00:50:31.071]  I'm going to cover this too in the third hour because we've got a guest coming up and I want to get to your calls, but we'll cover all that.
[00:50:32.697 --> 00:50:34.278]  In the third hour today.
[00:50:34.298 --> 00:50:37.140]  We'll cover it with Jim Marsh too.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.842]  But I know Steve Watson is doing a report on this.
[00:50:40.682 --> 00:50:47.106]  And I would just add that there was a film about the attack on the Olympics in Munich.
[00:50:48.047 --> 00:50:56.573]  And in that film, they have the former head of German security admitting they staged a hijacking.
[00:50:57.473 --> 00:50:58.634]  So another example right there.
[00:51:04.881 --> 00:51:10.310]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:18.302]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.033 --> 00:51:26.096]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.476 --> 00:51:37.921]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.221 --> 00:51:42.163]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.183 --> 00:51:44.124]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.444 --> 00:51:48.286]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:01.368 --> 00:53:03.089]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.309 --> 00:53:07.010]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:09.531]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:53:10.051 --> 00:53:16.254]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.414 --> 00:53:21.315]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.536 --> 00:53:30.479]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:54:05.748 --> 00:54:07.288]  This show is documented.
[00:54:07.788 --> 00:54:10.530]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:14.492]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:14.892 --> 00:54:19.014]  I went down, down, down and the flames went higher.
[00:54:19.534 --> 00:54:23.756]  And it burns, burns, burns the ring of fire.
[00:54:24.717 --> 00:54:25.537]  The ring of fire.
[00:54:25.597 --> 00:54:28.598]  We're gonna go to Roger, Richard, Kent, Charles, everybody.
[00:54:28.738 --> 00:54:33.521]  Right now let's go to Kyle in the Czech Republic.
[00:54:33.561 --> 00:54:33.921]  Welcome.
[00:54:35.859 --> 00:54:36.784]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[00:54:37.065 --> 00:54:38.111]  Good, thanks for calling in.
[00:54:38.131 --> 00:54:38.673]  What's on your mind?
[00:54:39.636 --> 00:54:40.356]  No, not too much.
[00:54:40.416 --> 00:54:46.458]  I wanted to actually just issue a call to action to all the listeners and expats here in Prague.
[00:54:47.638 --> 00:54:49.819]  President Bush is coming into town today.
[00:54:49.839 --> 00:54:52.039]  He comes into town in one hour at 8 o'clock.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:58.181]  And I've been reading the news reports today and it looks like he's going to be near the castle.
[00:54:58.601 --> 00:55:01.682]  And the metro stop for that is Malostranska metro.
[00:55:02.402 --> 00:55:06.263]  And basically what they're protesting here is that they're protesting the missile system.
[00:55:06.303 --> 00:55:08.224]  But I think this is a good chance for those
[00:55:08.966 --> 00:55:11.687]  Uh, in the 9-11 Truth community here, and there are a lot of them.
[00:55:11.727 --> 00:55:22.069]  I've met them to come out and to show Bush that we know around the world to confront these people wherever they go, as you say, and this is an excellent opportunity to do so, so I'm just issuing a call to action.
[00:55:23.709 --> 00:55:25.550]  That's right, his lordship is coming into town.
[00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:34.672]  What do you think of, uh, Texas Governor Rick Perry, who's literally handing over the entire infrastructure of Texas to the globalists, being summoned to Bilderberg and Istanbul?
[00:55:35.638 --> 00:55:36.539]  Oh, it's terrible.
[00:55:36.619 --> 00:55:43.162]  It's absolutely terrible that our public servants have basically just sold our country out.
[00:55:43.242 --> 00:55:44.883]  I mean, they've destroyed it.
[00:55:44.943 --> 00:55:46.985]  America is no longer what it was.
[00:55:47.505 --> 00:55:49.866]  Like, it's just terrible.
[00:55:50.887 --> 00:55:52.188]  They're only accelerating it.
[00:55:52.348 --> 00:55:55.269]  Alright, well folks, should the devil only be there then?
[00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.630]  To what?
[00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:57.971]  Protest Bush at the castle?
[00:55:58.011 --> 00:55:59.672]  That's a landmark in Prague?
[00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:01.310]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:02.391]  It's a big landmark.
[00:56:02.471 --> 00:56:03.991]  It's up on a hill.
[00:56:04.351 --> 00:56:07.632]  Everyone who lives here knows exactly where it is.
[00:56:08.452 --> 00:56:12.013]  The metro that's closest, again, is Malostranska, so please come out.
[00:56:12.434 --> 00:56:15.174]  All right, well, take some photos and send them to us.
[00:56:15.895 --> 00:56:18.195]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Roger in Texas.
[00:56:18.295 --> 00:56:19.356]  Roger, you're on the air.
[00:56:20.976 --> 00:56:21.676]  Hello, Alex.
[00:56:22.237 --> 00:56:22.757]  Yes, Roger.
[00:56:25.017 --> 00:56:26.338]  Yes, good morning.
[00:56:26.778 --> 00:56:27.178]  Good morning.
[00:56:28.504 --> 00:56:31.427]  I just have something I would like to inform you about.
[00:56:31.768 --> 00:56:46.606]  It might sound a tad crazy, but believe it or not, I have an informant from the High Echelon of the Temple of the Golden Dawn that says that the Rothschilds are planning to implement their new world leader
[00:56:47.914 --> 00:57:01.443]  Uh, next year in the elections and that he will be a man and that part of this whole Iraqi crisis is because their ultimate goal to bring in the new world order is to rebuild the temple of Solomon in the Middle East.
[00:57:03.764 --> 00:57:08.087]  Well, everybody knows they're trying to rebuild the temple right now, but there's a problem.
[00:57:08.127 --> 00:57:11.049]  There's a big mosque sitting on it, the Dome of the Rock Mosque.
[00:57:11.792 --> 00:57:21.259]  Well, of course, and you know, you gotta destroy before you rebuild, and I know everybody talks about Hitler and this and that, but I guarantee you there will be a man.
[00:57:21.599 --> 00:57:27.843]  Well, you know there's a lot of fruitcake groups, too, and a lot of wannabes running around claiming that they're part of this order and that order.
[00:57:28.164 --> 00:57:31.246]  You know there's a lot of pretenders to Illuminati organizations.
[00:57:32.507 --> 00:57:35.108]  Oh, no, this one's very legit.
[00:57:35.649 --> 00:57:38.010]  Sure, sure.
[00:57:39.351 --> 00:57:40.452]  Listen, great, good to talk to you.
[00:57:40.472 --> 00:57:41.433]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:57:42.468 --> 00:57:42.869]  Thank you.
[00:57:43.269 --> 00:57:45.350]  Let's talk to Richard in Texas.
[00:57:45.451 --> 00:57:46.331]  Richard, you're on the air.
[00:57:46.371 --> 00:57:46.651]  Go ahead.
[00:57:46.671 --> 00:57:52.436]  Okay, we're going to let him go.
[00:57:52.496 --> 00:57:54.217]  Let's go ahead and go to Kent in Louisiana.
[00:57:54.257 --> 00:57:54.837]  Go ahead, Kent.
[00:57:56.819 --> 00:57:57.760]  Yes, this is Kenneth.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:10.469]  I visited Dry Evangelical Church yesterday, Alex, and there were no bodies in the church in their 20s or 30s, which was kind of good news because these churches that are kosher, they drive the
[00:58:11.189 --> 00:58:20.111]  They, you know, they drain the light blood of nationalism out of a person, but I noticed there was one person in Sunday School, and I couldn't help but contain myself, Alex.
[00:58:20.812 --> 00:58:26.893]  He started talking about how crazy those Muslim people over there are committing suicide, and that's when I lost it, you know?
[00:58:26.953 --> 00:58:28.034]  I tell you what, stay there.
[00:58:28.054 --> 00:58:29.894]  I want to hear about what happened when we get back.
[00:58:30.814 --> 00:58:32.135]  See, it's two-fold.
[00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:39.217]  The globalists of the World Council of Churches destroy the teachings of the church, then that causes the people to lay down.
[00:58:39.257 --> 00:58:40.417]  I'll tell you the second part when we get back.
[00:58:41.579 --> 00:58:46.254]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.047 --> 00:59:02.229]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.889 --> 00:59:03.710]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:05.371]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.011 --> 00:59:09.993]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:14.335]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.956 --> 00:59:21.959]  Jim Mars is a respected author and newspaper journalist.
[00:59:24.187 --> 00:59:31.852]  You'll be joining us coming up in the next segment to talk about Bilderberg 2007 that just closed down yesterday in Istanbul, Turkey.
[00:59:31.892 --> 00:59:37.876]  The latest 9-11 developments, all the new JFK bombshell information that's been coming out.
[00:59:37.936 --> 00:59:39.297]  That's coming up.
[00:59:39.437 --> 00:59:42.479]  Then the last 30 minutes of the next hour, I've got a pastor coming on.
[00:59:43.135 --> 00:59:46.957]  Who was criticizing abortion, so the government's coming and saying they're going to shut them down.
[00:59:47.557 --> 00:59:51.519]  See, first just don't talk about politics, then don't talk about issues that are in politics.
[00:59:51.959 --> 00:59:55.500]  Total violation of the First Amendment, but hey, this is the new America.
[00:59:57.181 --> 01:00:01.023]  Where you're going to have your children taken if you're a citizen, but illegal aliens are above the law.
[01:00:01.963 --> 01:00:03.484]  Let's go to Kent, Louisiana.
[01:00:03.504 --> 01:00:10.167]  He said he was at his Sunday school, and there's no more young people there, and that's what most... See, first the globalists come in.
[01:00:10.547 --> 01:00:12.328]  England's about 30, 40 years ahead of us.
[01:00:13.809 --> 01:00:15.951]  And literally the churches are empty and dead over there.
[01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:23.559]  I mean it's like over 95% of the practitioners or the parishioners is the right word, are gone.
[01:00:25.401 --> 01:00:36.273]  And that's because first they come in with the World Council of Churches doctrine and don't make it exciting or dynamic or about serving in the community or doing really good things and they destroy the churches first.
[01:00:37.671 --> 01:00:44.856]  Or they make it about, name it and claim it, voodoo stuff, where you chant and get what you want, basically.
[01:00:45.216 --> 01:00:49.279]  It's magic, white magic, is what a lot of the churches teach.
[01:00:49.319 --> 01:00:49.920]  That's what it is.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.281]  Pretty darn evil, folks don't know it, though.
[01:00:52.962 --> 01:00:56.704]  But, you know, that's their cup of tea, floats their boat, c'est la vie.
[01:00:58.385 --> 01:01:00.527]  And then the churches all fall apart that way, too.
[01:01:01.207 --> 01:01:03.649]  And the globalists wanted that to begin with.
[01:01:04.284 --> 01:01:10.329]  So, see, at first they neutralize the teaching, then the churches die, then they all fall apart.
[01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:15.714]  And then the police are busy just shutting down home churches and secret churches that we already have.
[01:01:15.734 --> 01:01:17.656]  A lot of churches in America are now secret.
[01:01:19.057 --> 01:01:24.362]  The cities are passing laws, even if you're not in an area zone, where they come after you and try to shut down your churches.
[01:01:24.882 --> 01:01:27.024]  They even shut down Orthodox Jewish organizations.
[01:01:27.974 --> 01:01:30.196]  It's to shut anything down that isn't licensed.
[01:01:30.256 --> 01:01:30.937]  It's the new freedom.
[01:01:31.718 --> 01:01:33.760]  Let's go back to Kenneth in Louisiana.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.520]  Finish up your story.
[01:01:35.181 --> 01:01:40.386]  Yeah, well, anyway, I told the guy in front of everybody, I said, look, the U.S.
[01:01:40.466 --> 01:01:43.188]  government killed 650,000 Iraqis.
[01:01:43.709 --> 01:01:45.871]  We're bombing their... That's just in the first three years.
[01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:47.933]  We're now four years, four months in.
[01:01:48.633 --> 01:01:49.254]  Right.
[01:01:49.334 --> 01:01:51.116]  And we're bombing their houses.
[01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:56.774]  Killing their families, and I told them if that was happening to me, I would feel suicidal too.
[01:01:57.314 --> 01:02:09.864]  By the way, I was watching raw footage out of Fallujah last night, and I mean folks, we're talking dead babies all over the place, we're talking sewage everywhere, we're talking about people being retina scanned.
[01:02:10.044 --> 01:02:17.049]  I remember before he left, Tom Brokaw three years ago said that for two and a half years, anybody without an ID card is killed on the spot.
[01:02:17.089 --> 01:02:20.772]  That's how it is there, and those guys are all coming back here to be cops, folks.
[01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:27.863]  And I want all these neokinds to watch the video of these children and say they're animals.
[01:02:30.726 --> 01:02:31.406]  So what'd he say?
[01:02:34.669 --> 01:02:35.249]  What's that Alex?
[01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:37.051]  Kenneth, you're on the air my friend.
[01:02:38.031 --> 01:02:39.793]  So tell me more about the discussion.
[01:02:40.293 --> 01:02:44.336]  Well, there was a lady that agreed with me and he felt silent, I guess.
[01:02:44.396 --> 01:02:47.659]  He felt like maybe I had a good point.
[01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:54.231]  Well, he was just parroting the thing of there's something over there.
[01:02:54.511 --> 01:02:57.951]  I bet he didn't know which direction Iraq was.
[01:02:58.011 --> 01:02:59.172]  I bet he knew nothing.
[01:03:00.012 --> 01:03:01.092]  You're probably right.
[01:03:01.932 --> 01:03:05.193]  You can tell he's probably one of these guys that watch Fox News.
[01:03:05.953 --> 01:03:10.914]  These people, you know, they need their pride knocked off because they have a lot of pride in them.
[01:03:11.034 --> 01:03:16.314]  They just have a lot of pride.
[01:03:16.935 --> 01:03:19.575]  Well, good job confronting him and I appreciate the call.
[01:03:20.476 --> 01:03:26.777]  By the way, I'm not saying that the Muslims didn't invade Europe and that the Crusades weren't a response to that.
[01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:34.559]  I'm not saying that there aren't a percentage of Muslims who do want to convert by the sword.
[01:03:35.679 --> 01:03:38.120]  So then why is our government bringing them in at record levels?
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:41.081]  Why is Europe flooding Europe with them?
[01:03:41.661 --> 01:03:44.081]  Because, again, they're using them.
[01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:45.642]  They control them.
[01:03:45.962 --> 01:03:47.022]  They created Al-Qaeda.
[01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:49.010]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:49.330 --> 01:03:50.451]  That's the point I'm trying to make.
[01:03:56.856 --> 01:03:57.397]  It's here.
[01:03:57.577 --> 01:04:02.361]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.741 --> 01:04:10.367]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:11.064 --> 01:04:18.128]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.528 --> 01:04:30.054]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.254 --> 01:04:33.736]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.217 --> 01:04:36.118]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.478 --> 01:04:40.320]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:57.078 --> 01:05:58.199]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[01:05:58.399 --> 01:06:02.522]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[01:06:15.718 --> 01:06:18.400]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.

[01:06:28.808 --> 01:06:32.531]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:39.076]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[01:06:39.256 --> 01:06:40.297]  Are you ready to go solar?
[01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:41.437]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.

[01:06:54.889 --> 01:07:00.935]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.555 --> 01:07:04.518]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:13.175 --> 01:07:16.537]  Jim Mars is a frequent guest, comes on every few months.
[01:07:17.597 --> 01:07:19.358]  He's always been right on the money there.
[01:07:19.378 --> 01:07:22.360]  I know he takes care of his extremely elderly mother.
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:26.141]  He's not answering the phone, and so, you know, that's fine.
[01:07:26.161 --> 01:07:27.542]  I've been wanting to just take calls.
[01:07:28.823 --> 01:07:36.687]  In fact, I've just told my producer, one day this week we're leaving wide open, I think it's Wednesday, to just take calls, or to have more time to take calls.
[01:07:36.727 --> 01:07:39.228]  Of course, I'll be running on at the mouth and covering news.
[01:07:40.138 --> 01:07:49.985]  So we'll just take calls in this hour and cover news, and then we do have a guest the last 30 minutes of the show, Pastor Mark Holick, Spirit of Christian Center.
[01:07:50.546 --> 01:07:52.547]  They were told, do not bad-mouth abortion!
[01:07:54.568 --> 01:07:57.410]  Just, you understand, keep your mouth shut!
[01:07:59.692 --> 01:08:01.593]  So, whatever happened to the First Amendment?
[01:08:02.914 --> 01:08:05.136]  Well, the new America happened to it, that's right.
[01:08:06.943 --> 01:08:21.429]  Where government policies and new laws every couple minutes, that's how many they pass, superseded the Bill of Rights and Constitution because men with machine guns and low IQs said so.
[01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:27.591]  And we will be able to, this hour, get into GOP head.
[01:08:27.631 --> 01:08:31.133]  We need more attacks on American soil so people appreciate Bush.
[01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:33.434]  I want to cover the whole story.
[01:08:33.494 --> 01:08:34.774]  Shin Bettenwald and 76 hijackings.
[01:08:37.222 --> 01:08:40.583]  Giuliani JFK plot proves I should be president.
[01:08:40.623 --> 01:08:42.584]  That's what he's out running around saying.
[01:08:43.424 --> 01:08:47.586]  Also, they're reporting the UN saying they're afraid the dollar may completely collapse.
[01:08:48.186 --> 01:08:49.726]  That means almost no value in it.
[01:08:50.246 --> 01:08:53.728]  The yuppies still won't know what that means, though, because they're so smart.
[01:08:53.748 --> 01:08:55.208]  They've got it all figured out.
[01:08:57.049 --> 01:08:59.169]  Let's go to Charles in Louisiana.
[01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:01.090]  Charles, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:04.631]  Mr. Jones, I wanted to ask you, what's happening in Virginia?
[01:09:04.651 --> 01:09:06.652]  Do you hear anything about what's going on?
[01:09:07.972 --> 01:09:17.998]  Well, the government ran its black-op, it has all the earmarks, all the tell-tale signs of a black-op, of a mind-control op, and now they're now using it to go after guns nationwide as usual.
[01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:33.628]  Well, I got a phone call from Rocky, he listens to your program, Sunday, saying that, you know, on a CB, CBBs or whatever it is, they're gonna, a lot of state troopers are gonna go up there, they're gonna stop every truck going through Virginia, and I just thought maybe you heard something about it.
[01:09:34.591 --> 01:09:46.497]  I have heard that they're going to start searching vehicles, but we have to do this to stop the mysterious shooter that the Feds ordered the local police to stand down for hours so he could do his work.
[01:09:46.877 --> 01:09:48.959]  Yeah, and the Feds are going to go to Los Angeles.
[01:09:52.559 --> 01:09:53.159]  I'll tell you the truth.
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.020]  It's just a police state.
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:55.040]  But I wanted to say this.
[01:09:55.801 --> 01:10:00.303]  I was watching some of the people in the restaurants with their cell phones and eating in these buffets.
[01:10:00.743 --> 01:10:02.544]  They act like there's nothing wrong.
[01:10:02.564 --> 01:10:03.524]  Everything's alright.
[01:10:03.724 --> 01:10:04.765]  Oh, they're gonna find out.
[01:10:04.805 --> 01:10:07.366]  Look, there's a reason they're setting up this police state.
[01:10:07.746 --> 01:10:10.067]  And it's because they got something in store for those...
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:14.321]  Yeah, and the kids run a while.
[01:10:14.341 --> 01:10:17.202]  But I'm going to tell you, I know I get discouraged about once a year.
[01:10:17.562 --> 01:10:21.203]  But Mr. Jones, I'm so discouraged with the ignorance of the American people.
[01:10:21.263 --> 01:10:22.103]  Well, don't worry.
[01:10:22.163 --> 01:10:23.704]  Hey, listen.
[01:10:24.124 --> 01:10:25.124]  Charles, I know you well.
[01:10:25.144 --> 01:10:29.205]  I know you've lived a life and experienced quite a bit that a lot of people haven't experienced.
[01:10:29.245 --> 01:10:31.106]  That's why they don't know, Charles.
[01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:34.447]  They've never been on the other side of the
[01:10:35.939 --> 01:10:37.000]  Rainbow, as they say.
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:40.782]  They've never seen, they've never seen what's on the other side.
[01:10:40.802 --> 01:10:43.824]  And they've never seen, once you see it, there's no going back.
[01:10:44.204 --> 01:10:47.446]  They've never put the glasses on, Charles.
[01:10:47.866 --> 01:10:52.949]  And so, they're going to have to be hit upside the head with a 2x4 before they finally grow up.
[01:10:52.989 --> 01:10:53.409]  Go ahead.
[01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:58.132]  When they put them cattle fries, strip them naked and put them cattle fries on, that's going to wake them up.
[01:10:58.792 --> 01:11:00.093]  It's going to destroy their mind.
[01:11:00.885 --> 01:11:02.466]  You're going to see it happen to you.
[01:11:18.677 --> 01:11:19.518]  We're good to go.
[01:11:38.215 --> 01:11:39.715]  Americans have turned into rats.
[01:11:39.876 --> 01:11:40.756]  Just stitches.
[01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:41.636]  The children are stitches.
[01:11:41.656 --> 01:11:42.176]  Well, it is true.
[01:11:42.216 --> 01:11:45.497]  I mean, there's a large portion of the country that are demon creatures.
[01:11:45.557 --> 01:11:47.878]  We'll have to call the police on each other.
[01:11:47.938 --> 01:11:49.158]  Don't even talk to each other.
[01:11:49.498 --> 01:11:52.759]  And all they want to do is fill a mouthful of pizza pie and beer.
[01:11:53.099 --> 01:11:54.680]  But there's going to be a few.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.040]  There's going to be a very few that will stand up to it.
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:02.842]  I don't think we'll win, but we're going to try to protect those hogs that love to eat and drink beer.
[01:12:03.202 --> 01:12:04.602]  A few of us will try.
[01:12:04.622 --> 01:12:06.803]  And I want to thank them for not doing nothing.
[01:12:08.424 --> 01:12:09.124]  But a country!
[01:12:10.004 --> 01:12:11.685]  How cowardly can they be?
[01:12:12.105 --> 01:12:13.365]  And they claim to know God!
[01:12:14.625 --> 01:12:18.066]  Well, it's the churches that are the main reason they've been neutralized.
[01:12:18.406 --> 01:12:20.627]  I've been thrown off three churches because of your tapes.
[01:12:21.167 --> 01:12:23.327]  Three churches I'm forbidden to go on a property.
[01:12:23.807 --> 01:12:28.368]  The police didn't put me in a jail because I gave them other copies of your tapes.
[01:12:29.088 --> 01:12:31.629]  I gave them Dark Secrets of Bohemian Grove.
[01:12:32.029 --> 01:12:36.370]  And when they seen it, they couldn't deny it, but they escorted me off the property.
[01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:44.465]  Well, I mean, Richard Nixon said that they have homosexual orgies there.
[01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:47.227]  I'm not going to play it because he cusses on the tape.
[01:12:47.987 --> 01:12:51.510]  For a decade plus, people claimed that Harper's had misquoted him.
[01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:56.813]  Harper's is one of the oldest and most respected newspapers, publications in the country, by the way.
[01:12:57.294 --> 01:13:00.196]  And so Harper's, what, four years ago just released the tape.
[01:13:01.617 --> 01:13:06.120]  And then of course later, the Nixon White House released the tape.
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:07.521]  They've been taping it too.
[01:13:08.446 --> 01:13:16.393]  And that's not me, that's Richard Nixon saying that they have homosexual orgies at the Bohemian Grove!
[01:13:17.334 --> 01:13:23.819]  And I've had national Christian talk shows say that I'm a liar, I'm the devil, Bohemian Grove doesn't exist!
[01:13:24.279 --> 01:13:25.419]  Well, how can I deny the tape?
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:38.044]  All I have to do is look at the tape and see a 44-year-old... Listen, Carl Wigglesworth, with the number one show in San Antonio at the time, got on air and said that I had made a fake tape and that I shot it in my backyard.
[01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:43.446]  And he had a Bohemian Grove member on to say that the video I shot was fake.
[01:13:44.179 --> 01:13:45.021]  That's impossible.
[01:13:45.321 --> 01:13:48.766]  If anybody listens to the news media, they have people break into that already.
[01:13:48.987 --> 01:13:51.030]  They have other people talk about Bohemian Grove.
[01:13:51.711 --> 01:13:53.314]  It doesn't matter, sir.
[01:13:53.334 --> 01:13:55.577]  It doesn't matter, Charles.
[01:13:56.118 --> 01:13:59.283]  Rush Limbaugh has said the CFR doesn't exist.
[01:13:59.955 --> 01:14:00.155]  Yeah.
[01:14:00.596 --> 01:14:01.917]  Well these people are in denial.
[01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:25.153]  And the rest of these people, I don't know where they're at.
[01:14:25.173 --> 01:14:28.815]  There's only going to be a small percentage, like you and a few thousand of us.
[01:14:29.095 --> 01:14:32.237]  But I'm telling you, somebody will stand up against his evil.
[01:14:32.517 --> 01:14:39.301]  And as far as these soccer team moms and all the beer dads, I don't care what happens to them.
[01:14:39.321 --> 01:14:40.562]  I'm just caring about the Patriots.
[01:14:41.314 --> 01:14:41.574]  You know?
[01:14:41.854 --> 01:14:47.317]  Well, that's all you can do if the, you know what, if it's the oscillating equipment.
[01:14:48.718 --> 01:14:55.942]  All you can do is take care of your family and your neighbors and get those relationships with neighbors now so if they want your help, help them.
[01:14:56.262 --> 01:15:00.924]  But listen, jumping in to save a drowning person that's clawing at you and trying to push you under?
[01:15:01.444 --> 01:15:02.005]  Don't do it.
[01:15:02.245 --> 01:15:03.265]  Well, I'm proud of it.
[01:15:03.285 --> 01:15:07.948]  In Paris, I mean, I woke enough people up, and I take credit for that.
[01:15:08.508 --> 01:15:10.349]  I did wake a lot of policemen up.
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:14.361]  People in restaurants and sandwich shops, coffee shops, little shops.
[01:15:14.721 --> 01:15:16.522]  Enough that I won't be by myself.
[01:15:18.762 --> 01:15:23.164]  God bless you, my friend, and God bless your wife, and how are your chihuahuas doing?
[01:15:23.384 --> 01:15:24.504]  I got another one.
[01:15:24.704 --> 01:15:25.724]  Somebody threw up in the car.
[01:15:26.044 --> 01:15:26.825]  I call him Beep Beep.
[01:15:28.185 --> 01:15:31.246]  But God bless you, Mr. Jones, and thank you for being there for us.
[01:15:31.746 --> 01:15:32.106]  Thank you.
[01:15:32.186 --> 01:15:32.866]  You bet.
[01:15:33.066 --> 01:15:34.247]  It's good to talk to you.
[01:15:34.327 --> 01:15:35.227]  I appreciate you calling.
[01:15:36.457 --> 01:15:38.558]  I've seen the newspaper articles about Charles Case.
[01:15:38.638 --> 01:15:39.758]  It's admitted he was innocent.
[01:15:40.318 --> 01:15:41.598]  He tried to help somebody in a parking lot.
[01:15:41.618 --> 01:15:45.079]  He saw he'd been shot and they tortured him, put bags over his head.
[01:15:45.099 --> 01:15:46.840]  He did the normal routine deal.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:50.601]  I mean, here in Austin, they show cops putting guns to people's heads on the news.
[01:15:51.901 --> 01:15:53.482]  And they still convict them.
[01:15:53.722 --> 01:15:55.342]  They put the gun to their head.
[01:15:55.782 --> 01:15:59.924]  They say, I'm going to blow your head off if you don't sign the paper saying you murdered these girls.
[01:16:01.064 --> 01:16:04.385]  And then DNA comes out later proving it wasn't that person.
[01:16:04.405 --> 01:16:04.945]  They don't care.
[01:16:06.818 --> 01:16:10.279]  By the way, last night I was driving into town listening to KLBJ.
[01:16:10.359 --> 01:16:11.439]  I didn't do my show live.
[01:16:11.499 --> 01:16:12.420]  My Sunday show yesterday.
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:13.420]  I spent some time with the family.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:18.902]  I heard Kenny Romire doing his Sunday night show here locally.
[01:16:19.922 --> 01:16:25.444]  They were talking about the cops, the feds are coming in to basically start the federalization process of Austin.
[01:16:26.924 --> 01:16:28.985]  First they train you how to act like a bunch of goons.
[01:16:29.005 --> 01:16:30.085]  Then you act like goons.
[01:16:30.605 --> 01:16:32.446]  Cowardly goons with instinctive firing.
[01:16:32.966 --> 01:16:33.886]  Then you get into trouble.
[01:16:34.066 --> 01:16:35.907]  Then the feds come in and they federalize you.
[01:16:36.969 --> 01:16:38.810]  Just like Detroit and so many other cities.
[01:16:40.411 --> 01:16:48.275]  And the feds are torching Waco and Ruby Ridge and running murder for hire from New York to Chicago to Boston to Houston.
[01:16:48.536 --> 01:16:58.081]  I mean, caught red-handed and framing thousands at the FBI crime lab and engaged in... I mean, statistically, the feds are many times worse, but see, they get to be the saviors.
[01:16:58.681 --> 01:17:03.324]  They get to come into the cities and come into the counties and take over and violate the 10th Amendment.
[01:17:04.648 --> 01:17:10.613]  So I called in, and then the head of the NAACP calls in right after me and says, I just want to respond to Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:17:10.633 --> 01:17:12.554]  In fact, I meant to tell my producer to get him on.
[01:17:15.517 --> 01:17:18.319]  I wanted to have a debate with him, and he sounded like a nice guy.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:20.821]  The local head of the NAACP.
[01:17:22.242 --> 01:17:27.386]  And he said, listen, I want to respond to Mr. Jones saying, regardless of what the police have done, we don't need the feds in here.
[01:17:28.107 --> 01:17:30.829]  My people would still be slaves if it wasn't for the feds.
[01:17:31.409 --> 01:17:33.671]  Your people are still slaves because of them.
[01:17:35.567 --> 01:17:37.788]  Lincoln, who you're told is your hero.
[01:17:37.828 --> 01:17:39.188]  By the way, I'm not for the South, either.
[01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:40.528]  That was British-controlled.
[01:17:40.828 --> 01:17:42.669]  See, both sides were manipulated.
[01:17:42.689 --> 01:17:44.509]  Because I've actually read the history books.
[01:17:44.889 --> 01:17:45.369]  You haven't.
[01:17:46.289 --> 01:17:49.610]  Lincoln said, I wouldn't free one black slave to reunite the Union.
[01:17:49.930 --> 01:17:52.371]  It was about who would control Western expansion.
[01:17:52.731 --> 01:17:55.811]  The Northern elite, or the British-backed Southern elite.
[01:17:56.852 --> 01:18:00.773]  And they almost had civil war with Andrew Jackson, but he wouldn't let it happen.
[01:18:01.033 --> 01:18:02.593]  But he did get the taxes cut.
[01:18:03.746 --> 01:18:04.886]  The South wanted to rebel.
[01:18:04.926 --> 01:18:09.647]  That's where Andrew Jackson was from in the 1830s because of the taxes.
[01:18:09.667 --> 01:18:11.068]  It was about taxes, okay?
[01:18:12.268 --> 01:18:15.649]  It was the sons of the Revolutionary War individuals.
[01:18:16.069 --> 01:18:18.129]  And they weren't going to be under unjust taxes.
[01:18:18.809 --> 01:18:21.310]  They had taxes on the South that were not on the North.
[01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:22.870]  That's what the war was about.
[01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:25.971]  Let me... I've literally read 20, 30 books on it.
[01:18:26.151 --> 01:18:27.631]  Okay, I know what I'm talking about.
[01:18:27.851 --> 01:18:32.052]  When we get back, I'm going to respond to the NAACP and this thing about the Feds.
[01:18:34.401 --> 01:18:42.366]  Okay, and then we'll go to David, Jerry, Richard, Tommy, and others.
[01:18:42.686 --> 01:18:47.169]  Then I'll get into the shin-bat-behind-the-Al Qaeda behavior.
[01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:47.929]  Just all of it.
[01:18:48.570 --> 01:18:49.450]  It's all coming up.
[01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:50.171]  Big show.
[01:18:50.231 --> 01:18:50.691]  Stay with me.
[01:18:54.165 --> 01:18:59.128]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:18:59.428 --> 01:19:04.872]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.

[01:19:16.639 --> 01:19:25.984]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Perky's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:19:26.244 --> 01:19:29.746]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:19:53.524 --> 01:19:53.964]  Gold.
[01:19:54.304 --> 01:19:55.585]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:19:55.845 --> 01:20:01.928]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:20:02.128 --> 01:20:05.930]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:08.191]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:20:08.231 --> 01:20:10.532]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:20:10.673 --> 01:20:17.756]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every year.
[01:20:17.776 --> 01:20:18.417]  We're good to go.
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:36.100]  Thank you.
[01:20:52.874 --> 01:20:57.819]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:00.022]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:03.265]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:21:03.445 --> 01:21:06.589]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:21:06.889 --> 01:21:08.731]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:21:09.011 --> 01:21:12.713]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:21:12.993 --> 01:21:15.654]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible!
[01:21:16.274 --> 01:21:20.536]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[01:21:20.776 --> 01:21:25.058]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:21:25.458 --> 01:21:29.800]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.

[01:21:43.485 --> 01:21:44.005]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:21:44.025 --> 01:21:44.525]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:21:44.545 --> 01:21:45.106]  And ask for Packet B.
[01:21:53.098 --> 01:21:56.040]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:01.344]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:22:01.724 --> 01:22:07.008]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:22:07.428 --> 01:22:08.529]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:22:08.909 --> 01:22:17.717]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:22:18.237 --> 01:22:19.819]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[01:22:47.779 --> 01:22:48.560]  We don't need no education.
[01:23:08.209 --> 01:23:10.150]  I said I was going to come back and talk about something.
[01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:16.592]  Then I go out there during the break and talk about literally like ten different things with my crew.
[01:23:17.512 --> 01:23:19.653]  Then I walk back in here like I've had my mind wiped.
[01:23:21.474 --> 01:23:25.735]  We're going to have Luke Rudowsky popping in.
[01:23:25.775 --> 01:23:26.476]  He's on the road.
[01:23:27.196 --> 01:23:29.777]  They got into the Democratic National Debate.
[01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:40.414]  And they were able to confront Bill Richardson, the Bohemian Grove, New World Order, Bilderberg group member.
[01:23:41.315 --> 01:23:42.317]  Absolute gold.
[01:23:42.598 --> 01:23:43.259]  Great job.
[01:23:44.511 --> 01:23:47.954]  We still haven't even seen the footage they shot in front of John Edwards and Al Gore.
[01:23:48.454 --> 01:23:49.795]  That's how much they have.
[01:23:49.856 --> 01:23:51.097]  They're so busy running around.
[01:23:51.117 --> 01:23:58.323]  And this weekend again, I was online, noticed that MSNBC and Fox News used InfoWars.com footage.
[01:23:58.883 --> 01:24:01.405]  I own that footage.
[01:24:02.706 --> 01:24:04.668]  Luke works for InfoWars.com.
[01:24:05.388 --> 01:24:06.489]  I've licensed that.
[01:24:06.850 --> 01:24:08.951]  It says InfoWars on it, but c'est la vie.
[01:24:09.312 --> 01:24:10.613]  The point is, is that they
[01:24:13.175 --> 01:24:14.897]  They show it and didn't even give us credit.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:17.921]  That's how they operate.
[01:24:19.864 --> 01:24:21.065]  But it was national news.
[01:24:21.726 --> 01:24:23.909]  Oh look, the crazy is confronting Giuliani.
[01:24:25.832 --> 01:24:29.917]  But then didn't even mention WeAreChanged.org or InfoWars.com.
[01:24:30.686 --> 01:24:36.448]  That's why people have emailed me and said, why do you put up that big, ugly InfoWars at the top on the YouTube videos you put up?
[01:24:36.548 --> 01:24:44.770]  Well, A, we're putting them up for free, and I've got to pay for that, and then, you know, encoding, editing, all that, and then B, I mean, that's why I do that!
[01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:46.230]  And I kind of left it alone.
[01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:49.631]  I saw the videos that were uploaded and I thought, man, this is going to get grabbed.
[01:24:49.991 --> 01:24:50.932]  They're not going to get credit.
[01:24:52.052 --> 01:24:53.352]  It was like the John Kerry footage.
[01:24:53.492 --> 01:24:55.153]  I've slapped a big InfoWars on there.
[01:24:56.313 --> 01:25:03.697]  So that if they did take it nationally, they would have to give attention to the 9-11 Truth Movement, but they found other versions online that didn't have it.
[01:25:06.659 --> 01:25:09.241]  Because everybody else has got the key strategy.
[01:25:09.581 --> 01:25:14.423]  I mean, it's just basic 101 stuff, but we're all learning as we go here.
[01:25:16.164 --> 01:25:24.109]  It's just that... Well, the point is, Luke and the crew are just on fire right now, and I can only commend them.
[01:25:29.113 --> 01:25:33.616]  Let's go ahead and jam a call and then we're going to go to break and I'm going to come back and take more calls than covering the news.
[01:25:34.297 --> 01:25:37.759]  Let's go ahead and talk to David.
[01:25:37.919 --> 01:25:39.160]  David, where are you calling us from?
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:40.201]  New Hampshire.
[01:25:40.461 --> 01:25:40.781]  Welcome.
[01:25:42.503 --> 01:25:43.844]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:25:43.924 --> 01:25:44.164]  You bet.
[01:25:44.204 --> 01:25:44.524]  Go ahead.
[01:25:45.004 --> 01:25:53.090]  I just wanted to plug a video that I stumbled across online that shows that scumbag Giuliani for what he is before he comes up here to New Hampshire to preach his crap.
[01:25:54.731 --> 01:25:55.652]  What was on the video?
[01:25:58.343 --> 01:26:00.265]  It was made by Kevin Keaton.
[01:26:00.485 --> 01:26:07.152]  I can read you the synopsis, but it covers his rise to power, his policies, and his so-called turnaround in New York.
[01:26:07.692 --> 01:26:11.916]  It interviews journalists, activists, and legal experts, and many of the city's poor.
[01:26:12.297 --> 01:26:13.037]  How long is it?
[01:26:13.718 --> 01:26:14.859]  It's about an hour and 59 minutes.
[01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:18.052]  Send it to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:26:18.092 --> 01:26:20.714]  We'll get it posted up on JonesReport.com.
[01:26:20.794 --> 01:26:24.897]  I believe, I think we've linked to that before on Prison Planet, but I never had time to watch it all.
[01:26:25.437 --> 01:26:28.040]  Look, I didn't know Giuliani was a mob boss.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.261]  I didn't know his father was a mob boss.
[01:26:30.722 --> 01:26:32.103]  A mob capo, let's be clear.
[01:26:32.143 --> 01:26:32.803]  A mid-level boss.
[01:26:33.344 --> 01:26:40.229]  I didn't know that he gave a press conference when he left his second wife to announce it, and that his children won't talk to him.
[01:26:40.309 --> 01:26:41.110]  I mean, for years.
[01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:44.973]  I mean, just personally, I didn't know how evil he was.
[01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:48.396]  And how he enjoys being mean to his staff.
[01:26:48.916 --> 01:26:52.078]  I mean, he is supposed... I mean, not just for 9-11 and the 3,000.
[01:26:52.598 --> 01:26:54.259]  And there's no doubt he was involved.
[01:26:54.539 --> 01:26:55.240]  He was involved.
[01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:57.761]  I mean, he's a hardcore killer.
[01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:03.144]  This movie touches a little bit on his mob connections.
[01:27:03.665 --> 01:27:06.746]  It also shows some violations of the First Amendment.
[01:27:07.247 --> 01:27:12.530]  And one of them is his Storm Troop is storming into a jewelry store unannounced.
[01:27:13.911 --> 01:27:20.597]  Making the staff get down on the ground, putting them in handcuffs because they're having a crackdown on illegal jewelry.
[01:27:22.218 --> 01:27:23.279]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:23.319 --> 01:27:25.821]  Send us the video, and we'll check it out.
[01:27:27.382 --> 01:27:27.983]  Amazing.
[01:27:28.483 --> 01:27:34.348]  But I mean, that's what America deserves, is a guy that looks like, I mean, he literally, if he went to Hollywood,
[01:27:35.097 --> 01:27:47.683]  If Giuliani went to Hollywood without his name, and he looked and acted the way he acts, he would be cast as mob bosses, as evil characters, as a Nosferatu, as a vampiric creature.
[01:27:49.064 --> 01:27:51.785]  I mean, he literally radiates wickedness.
[01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:57.873]  And then his policies, anti-gun, pro-abortion, pro-open border.
[01:27:58.254 --> 01:28:00.534]  Of course he's going to be the Republican nominee.
[01:28:00.874 --> 01:28:02.455]  What do you think this party is?
[01:28:03.055 --> 01:28:06.176]  Of course Sean Hannity and Ian Limbaugh promoting.
[01:28:06.737 --> 01:28:09.618]  Because if they don't, all their skeletons are coming out of the closets.
[01:28:10.878 --> 01:28:12.939]  Don't you understand these people live in fear?
[01:28:13.979 --> 01:28:16.820]  They're afraid of losing their power, their money, their lives.
[01:28:18.461 --> 01:28:19.701]  They live in cowardice.
[01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:20.861]  They live in weakness.
[01:28:21.382 --> 01:28:22.422]  They live to serve evil.
[01:28:28.613 --> 01:28:29.974]  What has our country become?
[01:28:31.136 --> 01:28:38.403]  That a mob boss crook is probably going to be the Republican nominee, barring Ron Paul.
[01:28:39.404 --> 01:28:40.024]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.068 --> 01:28:47.071]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.992 --> 01:28:50.675]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.790 --> 01:29:02.755]  Attention women over 40, if you want to look as much as 20 years younger in less than one minute, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:29:02.935 --> 01:29:03.535]  Here's why.
[01:29:03.675 --> 01:29:07.958]  There's a brand new cosmetic product that makes wrinkles almost invisible to the naked eye.
[01:29:08.098 --> 01:29:13.241]  In fact, the new product allows some women to look so young so fast that it makes them feel like they're cheating.
[01:29:13.501 --> 01:29:15.282]  They are in a way, but it works.
[01:29:15.582 --> 01:29:19.164]  By the way, it's also a jealously guarded secret used by professional models.
[01:29:19.384 --> 01:29:24.368]  You see, these women often have to look much younger than they really are or else they lose their jobs.
[01:29:24.548 --> 01:29:31.733]  The product uses something like a magician's trick to actually de-age the appearance of human skin and it's now available to listeners of this station.
[01:29:31.933 --> 01:29:36.276]  Want to take years off your appearance and don't want cosmetic surgery or painful injections?
[01:29:36.476 --> 01:29:41.279]  There is now a very real chance you can do it with this new cream called simply Magician's Formula 987.
[01:29:41.319 --> 01:29:41.840]  Just go to 987magic.com.
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:42.620]  That's 987magic.com.
[01:29:46.483 --> 01:29:46.983]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:48.684 --> 01:29:52.464]  That's 877-327-0365.

[01:30:00.086 --> 01:30:02.407]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[01:30:02.687 --> 01:30:05.968]  That's why you need SFR's Protect-A Synthetic Oil Treatments.
[01:30:06.168 --> 01:30:10.929]  Protect-A Engine Treatment, Protect-A Transmission Treatment, and Protect-A Complete Fuel System Treatment.

[01:30:26.399 --> 01:30:28.641]  At Protekta, we do not compromise quality.

[01:30:53.826 --> 01:30:57.869]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:58.089 --> 01:31:01.491]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:31:01.651 --> 01:31:05.194]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:31:05.414 --> 01:31:08.656]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:08.676 --> 01:31:14.140]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:19.404]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[01:31:19.804 --> 01:31:20.404]  We're good to go!
[01:31:37.256 --> 01:31:40.717]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:31:40.737 --> 01:31:41.718]  That toll free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[01:31:59.915 --> 01:32:02.456]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[01:32:02.496 --> 01:32:04.496]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[01:32:04.896 --> 01:32:07.857]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[01:32:07.897 --> 01:32:11.617]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lift to Big John.
[01:32:13.298 --> 01:32:15.318]  Big John!
[01:32:16.078 --> 01:32:18.359]  Big John!
[01:32:18.899 --> 01:32:20.579]  Big Bad John!
[01:32:21.779 --> 01:32:22.820]  Big John!
[01:32:24.970 --> 01:32:50.580]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home He just drifted into town and stayed all alone Didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy But he spoke it all when he just said hi to Big John Somebody said he came from New Orleans Where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen And a crashing blow from a huge right hand Sent a Louisiana fella to the promised land, Big John
[01:32:52.404 --> 01:32:54.646]  Big John!
[01:32:55.207 --> 01:32:57.489]  Big John!
[01:32:58.009 --> 01:33:00.331]  Big Bad John!
[01:33:00.872 --> 01:33:03.054]  Big John!
[01:33:04.055 --> 01:33:09.880]  Then came the day at the bottom of the mine when the timber cracked and men started crying.
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:12.523]  Miners were praying and hearts beat fast.
[01:33:12.543 --> 01:33:15.625]  Everybody thought that they'd breathed their last except John.
[01:33:17.811 --> 01:33:28.817]  Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well Grabbed a sack and timber, gave out with a groan And like a giant old tree just stood there alone, Big John
[01:33:31.289 --> 01:33:32.589]  Big John!
[01:33:34.110 --> 01:33:35.190]  Big John!
[01:33:36.871 --> 01:33:39.131]  Big Bad John!
[01:33:39.772 --> 01:33:42.852]  Big John!
[01:33:43.072 --> 01:33:54.396]  With all his strength he gave a mighty shove Then a miner yelled out, there's a light up above And twenty men scrambled for what would be grave Now there's only one left down there to save Big John!
[01:33:56.738 --> 01:34:20.561]  With Jacks and Timbers they started back down Then came that rumble way down in the ground And the smoke and gas belts out of that mine Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John Big John Big John Big Bad John Big John
[01:34:21.776 --> 01:34:24.297]  Now, they never reopened that worthless pit.
[01:34:24.317 --> 01:34:27.417]  They just placed a marble stand in front of it.
[01:34:27.457 --> 01:34:35.459]  These few words written on that stand... At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man.
[01:34:36.559 --> 01:34:40.700]  Big John.
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:47.942]  Big bad John.
[01:34:48.062 --> 01:34:49.362]  Hey, why not play the whole thing?
[01:34:50.931 --> 01:34:55.312]  Alright, let me go over news, and then I'm going to continue with these loaded phone lines.
[01:34:55.332 --> 01:35:04.194]  Then about 15 into the next hour, we've got Luke Rudowsky joining us from the road leaving New Hampshire from the Democratic primaries debate they had.
[01:35:05.335 --> 01:35:07.555]  Really powerful stuff they reportedly got.
[01:35:07.575 --> 01:35:09.356]  He'll be giving us a report coming up in the next hour.
[01:35:09.816 --> 01:35:14.937]  Then we've got a pastor joining us from a major church told, you don't be bad-mouthing people for abortion.
[01:35:14.957 --> 01:35:16.138]  You keep your mouth shut, boy!
[01:35:16.558 --> 01:35:17.818]  This ain't America no more!
[01:35:18.909 --> 01:35:26.655]  And he's not saying yes or boss, so we'll be talking to them coming up in the next hour as well.
[01:35:28.537 --> 01:35:31.159]  I mentioned this earlier, but let me just get into the actual reports.
[01:35:31.519 --> 01:35:32.860]  This is from the United Nations.
[01:35:34.421 --> 01:35:34.761]  U.S.
[01:35:34.841 --> 01:35:37.143]  debt could trigger dollar collapse, U.N.
[01:35:37.183 --> 01:35:37.644]  warns.
[01:35:39.505 --> 01:35:45.810]  The United States is facing imminent collapse in the face of an unsustainable debt, the United Nations warns today.
[01:35:46.678 --> 01:35:50.180]  United States debt which had now deepened to well over three trillion.
[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:55.604]  By the way, three trillion is what is owed right now.
[01:35:55.764 --> 01:35:58.166]  That's in the rears.
[01:35:58.706 --> 01:36:00.327]  Yearly it's over nine trillion.
[01:36:00.367 --> 01:36:02.288]  These are official government numbers and these are cooked.
[01:36:02.549 --> 01:36:03.209]  It's far worse.
[01:36:03.609 --> 01:36:10.454]  Dallas Morning News in 2002 reported 44 plus trillion in actual obligations
[01:36:11.423 --> 01:36:15.124]  And then once you get to those type numbers, it starts ballooning exponentially.
[01:36:15.565 --> 01:36:26.828]  And the latest numbers that came out last year, and these are mainline, you know, top economists, are between $85 trillion and over $100 trillion.
[01:36:26.969 --> 01:36:31.190]  So you used to, you talked about millions, like that was a lot of money.
[01:36:31.810 --> 01:36:33.791]  Now a millionaire is kind of like upper middle class.
[01:36:34.311 --> 01:36:36.592]  Then you start talking about billions, like that was a big deal.
[01:36:37.242 --> 01:36:41.244]  Now they talk about 100 billion and 300 billion and 500 billion dollar deals.
[01:36:42.244 --> 01:36:45.165]  And you talk about in the derivatives every day, trillions back and forth.
[01:36:45.806 --> 01:36:48.427]  And now we're used to a couple billion was big for government debt.
[01:36:48.847 --> 01:36:53.128]  Now city budgets are 4 or 5 billion for even middle-sized towns like Austin.
[01:36:55.229 --> 01:36:59.851]  Big cities have got, you know, 50 billion, 30 billion, 40 billion dollar budgets.
[01:37:00.832 --> 01:37:01.472]  Like L.A.
[01:37:03.012 --> 01:37:06.654]  That's because the money is worth less than one cent
[01:37:07.196 --> 01:37:09.678]  Ron Paul in debates is using a 4 or 5 year old number.
[01:37:10.078 --> 01:37:13.260]  Very conserved number where he says it's worth 3 or 4 cents on the dollar.
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:14.521]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:37:15.101 --> 01:37:19.164]  It's, and again, a few months ago or so I was saying 1.3.
[01:37:19.865 --> 01:37:20.905]  That was the latest numbers.
[01:37:20.985 --> 01:37:23.347]  It's now below 1.3 in actual value.
[01:37:23.827 --> 01:37:30.191]  It's less, a dollar is worth less than 1 cent what it was worth in 1913.
[01:37:31.993 --> 01:37:36.916]  But see, most of that devaluation happened in just the last decade.
[01:37:37.873 --> 01:37:45.615]  You see, we've now had more losses in true value than what we had in the previous 70-80 years.
[01:37:48.375 --> 01:37:49.555]  You can go pull up all these numbers.
[01:37:49.575 --> 01:37:51.216]  I'm giving you generalizations.
[01:37:52.196 --> 01:37:57.437]  Bottom line, it's kind of like, did somebody hit you in the head with an axe 10 times or 20 times?
[01:37:57.497 --> 01:37:59.958]  I mean, at a certain point, it's a bucket of mush.
[01:37:59.978 --> 01:38:01.278]  It doesn't really matter.
[01:38:03.318 --> 01:38:05.699]  You know, do you got 20 gunshot wounds in you or 25?
[01:38:07.009 --> 01:38:09.171]  I'm just being general here, we're full of holes.
[01:38:10.092 --> 01:38:12.774]  We got so many holes in us there's not even blood coming out anymore.
[01:38:15.596 --> 01:38:24.344]  And I'm afraid I have to give you the news that all the king's horses and all the king's men aren't going to put this financial system back together again.
[01:38:26.205 --> 01:38:27.226]  But in a country
[01:38:28.388 --> 01:38:42.536]  Where the general public still, they've heard the word Bilderberg, they don't believe it exists, when it's on News 8 Austin, it's on KLBJ, it's on the cover of the Dallas Morning News, it's in other major newspapers from Europe to Asia.
[01:38:44.335 --> 01:38:49.920]  And still, I heard neocons this weekend on the radio, and I didn't even try to tune into it.
[01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:57.887]  I tuned in and just happened to hear them saying out of a San Antonio station that, well, the crazies are talking about some group they claim wants to rule the world.
[01:38:58.348 --> 01:39:02.872]  Now, those very same talk show hosts were saying, this didn't exist just a few years ago.
[01:39:05.154 --> 01:39:08.397]  And when you're dealing with that type of denial, what do you do?
[01:39:10.271 --> 01:39:21.417]  It's that same type denial where as they look at the stock market above 12,000 and they think, my gosh, the stock market's up a thousand points in the last year and a half!
[01:39:23.018 --> 01:39:25.119]  My goodness gracious, have you heard the news?
[01:39:26.379 --> 01:39:28.060]  My goodness, my stock's up 10-20%!
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:32.422]  You buffoon!
[01:39:34.683 --> 01:39:37.405]  That's a dollar devalued
[01:39:38.292 --> 01:39:49.500]  Just in the last seven years by at least half, and so of course you're going to have a stock market that went down to 9,000 from 11,000 in 2000, the year 2000, and then has now gone up 12,000 and something.
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:53.503]  If the stock market hadn't grown from 2000 to 2007 and just stayed the same, zero increase, just stayed the same,
[01:40:07.714 --> 01:40:15.459]  You would be looking at a stock market at upwards of $22,000 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[01:40:18.381 --> 01:40:19.381]  Now, that is simple.
[01:40:19.701 --> 01:40:20.442]  I'm no economist.
[01:40:20.462 --> 01:40:30.168]  I've interviewed a number of prize winners and many other, you know, countless top experts and people from our own field, and I've read papers written by Alan Greenspan when he was one of us in the mid-60s.
[01:40:30.288 --> 01:40:35.511]  It's in Ayn Rand's Capitalism, the Unrealized Dream.
[01:40:37.287 --> 01:40:39.229]  Which is true, we never really had true free market.
[01:40:45.974 --> 01:40:52.419]  So, I'm here watching the total and complete implosion.
[01:40:57.423 --> 01:40:59.124]  And people say, well I don't see it imploding.
[01:40:59.745 --> 01:41:04.128]  Well, I mean in the scale of time, in just a few years, you have the dollar down by 50%.
[01:41:05.606 --> 01:41:09.229]  And it was down 48% before that.
[01:41:11.931 --> 01:41:17.056]  And to see every indicator, every indices of out of control, rapid inflation.
[01:41:17.536 --> 01:41:20.058]  And back in the 70's they had to admit when we had inflation.
[01:41:20.359 --> 01:41:24.242]  Now they just tell you we don't have it and the general public says, okay we don't!
[01:41:30.407 --> 01:41:32.369]  You talk about a false reality.
[01:41:36.144 --> 01:41:38.025]  We are living in a false reality.
[01:41:40.047 --> 01:41:50.194]  And that just means that when the news of the crash comes home, it's going to be that much more tumultuous and violent and tectonic, volcanic, whatever term you want to use.
[01:41:51.975 --> 01:41:54.757]  Topsy-turvy, helter-skelter, bedlam.
[01:41:55.865 --> 01:42:17.032]  I mean, we had some riots and some strikes and some Pinkerton Man shootings during the Depression, and crime did go up quite a bit, but nothing compared to what crime is today, and all the top sociologists and psychiatrists that have publicly, I mean, look at the British report of four months ago on the flash mobs and hyper-riots,
[01:42:17.712 --> 01:42:27.641]  There's no debating that if this thing goes belly up now, it's going to be war in the streets, illegal aliens running around, burning and pillaging to their heart's desire.
[01:42:29.442 --> 01:42:31.344]  The feds are going to be provocateuring the whole thing.
[01:42:31.384 --> 01:42:32.285]  They run these groups.
[01:42:32.725 --> 01:42:36.929]  I'm telling you, we're in for some serious, serious times.
[01:42:41.452 --> 01:42:45.556]  And this whole police state they're setting up is to have
[01:42:46.764 --> 01:42:47.605]  They're way with us.
[01:42:53.068 --> 01:43:11.341]  Everything they're doing is so that they can engineer, by design, the total collapse and the radical re-engineering of society into a planned economy, where they'll have plenty of people that need to be a volunteer for the military because there's no other jobs, or plenty of people who will be prison guards or FEMA camp guards, and that's the big new
[01:43:14.756 --> 01:43:16.238]  We were able to get Jim Mars on with us.
[01:43:28.908 --> 01:43:33.930]  Better late than never, but what I want to do, Jim, is just reschedule you so we have a full hour with you in the future.
[01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:35.290]  I don't know if it was our fault or your fault.
[01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.850]  I don't care.
[01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:42.733]  It's just always great to have you with us, and I know you've been holding a minute or two while I was ranting about the headline, U.S.
[01:43:42.773 --> 01:43:45.754]  Debt Could Trigger Collapse of Dollar, U.N.
[01:43:45.794 --> 01:43:48.094]  Warns, when the very people that run the U.N.
[01:43:48.114 --> 01:43:50.835]  are the ones that designed this debt bubble.
[01:43:51.695 --> 01:43:53.196]  Jim, you want to comment on that?
[01:43:54.068 --> 01:43:58.433]  Yes, I'm glad to hear you say that this isn't just happening, okay?
[01:43:58.813 --> 01:44:02.237]  In fact, I like the quote from Franklin Roosevelt.
[01:44:02.277 --> 01:44:10.766]  He said, you know, especially in politics, if something happens, you better believe it didn't just happen.
[01:44:11.066 --> 01:44:15.551]  Somebody planned it that way, and you're absolutely on target when you say that
[01:44:16.031 --> 01:44:27.054]  This is a plan that's been formulated and imposed on the United States by what I call the fascist globalists, because, number one, they are globalists.
[01:44:27.074 --> 01:44:38.397]  They're looking for the One World, the New World Order, and they are fascists because they represent the blending of corporate and state power.
[01:44:39.738 --> 01:44:44.319]  In fascist Italy and in Nazi Germany, what we saw was the state
[01:44:44.899 --> 01:44:45.360]  I think so.
[01:45:06.684 --> 01:45:08.364]  Individual freedom and liberty.
[01:45:08.685 --> 01:45:14.686]  And number two, we have a Constitution, a Bill of Rights, that guarantees us that individual liberty.
[01:45:15.146 --> 01:45:17.447]  And number three, we have guns.
[01:45:17.987 --> 01:45:19.107]  Lots of guns.
[01:45:19.567 --> 01:45:33.591]  So they've had to move pretty slowly, and they're actually moving pretty surreptitiously still, because they... Otherwise, I guarantee you, those of you who are old enough to remember when Ronald Reagan was shot, and, um,
[01:45:34.969 --> 01:45:40.594]  Alexander Haig, his chief of staff, came on the television and said, I'm in charge here.
[01:45:41.415 --> 01:45:44.719]  And that really caused a little ruckus.
[01:45:44.959 --> 01:45:47.742]  In fact, he faded from the scene pretty fast.
[01:45:48.262 --> 01:45:50.224]  But he didn't overstep himself.
[01:45:50.324 --> 01:45:52.587]  He simply let the cat out of the bag.
[01:45:52.627 --> 01:45:53.427]  They were testing.
[01:45:53.447 --> 01:45:55.730]  They were probably going to get rid of Reagan if that would have gone over.
[01:45:56.477 --> 01:45:59.978]  Exactly, but it didn't go over, so they had to bide their time again.
[01:46:00.518 --> 01:46:21.483]  So now they, you know, it's amazing to me, Alex, how anyone can still believe in the war on terrorism, because if indeed we were supposed to be so afraid of terrorists slipping weapons of mass destruction into our country, you'd think they would at least do something to secure the borders
[01:46:21.963 --> 01:46:27.047]  But they've talked about it in the last year or so, but haven't done anything.
[01:46:28.708 --> 01:46:41.278]  In the latest story about the fellow, the lawyer of all people, who had a very dangerous, contagious form of tuberculosis, he flew in and out of the country four, five, six times.
[01:46:42.039 --> 01:46:44.020]  And he was on a watch list.
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:49.024]  By the way, it turns out that his family members are involved with the CDC.
[01:46:49.565 --> 01:46:50.866]  This is very suspicious.
[01:46:51.623 --> 01:46:52.384]  Absolutely.
[01:46:52.724 --> 01:47:00.929]  So they're pulling all kinds of little tricks and cons on us, and the ultimate goal is to destroy the United States.
[01:47:01.309 --> 01:47:09.274]  They've already pretty well destroyed it as a republic, and now they want to just flat destroy it as a nation, and as you so well pointed out,
[01:47:09.754 --> 01:47:19.999]  The end result will be martial law, and then they will redefine society, redefine our economy, and we will be another cog in the New World Order.
[01:47:20.139 --> 01:47:32.985]  And Jack Bauer, who Homeland Security openly has parties for, televised by C-SPAN, thanking him for, quote, giving us the moral authority, they admit that that's basically a government-produced show.
[01:47:34.022 --> 01:47:34.863]  Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[01:47:34.883 --> 01:47:46.349]  In fact, you know, it's very clear to me, having lived so long, that as a society as a whole, we have been guided into an era now where violence is not only condoned, but almost lauded.
[01:48:02.735 --> 01:48:15.204]  Uh, when I was growing up, you know, about the worst violence we were ever exposed to was hoblancasti shooting the pistol out of somebody's hand, you know, and they grabbed their hand and that was about it.
[01:48:16.145 --> 01:48:31.276]  Uh, it's amazing what goes on today and I thought I was always suave and sophisticated and I could go watch some, uh, bloody, scary, grim, dark movie, uh, say like Silence of the Lambs, which is very well done.
[01:48:31.983 --> 01:48:46.783]  But man, when I go see some of the films they're showing today, like the Saw movies, where it's nothing but planned, conscious torture of people, and this is what people are expected to buy, this is what they're expected to
[01:48:47.003 --> 01:48:55.187]  Well, that's meant to sear the conscience, so when it's really happening to your neighbor, when they're really, you know, they teach you that you're tough to go see that.
[01:48:55.207 --> 01:48:55.567]  No!
[01:48:55.867 --> 01:48:58.988]  They're deadening your responses.
[01:48:59.008 --> 01:49:00.109]  You're being conditioned.
[01:49:00.349 --> 01:49:02.290]  Your tenderness is your strength.
[01:49:02.730 --> 01:49:04.891]  They are literally burning off your feelers.
[01:49:05.551 --> 01:49:09.633]  Exactly, and they are conditioning you to accept that type of behavior.
[01:49:12.176 --> 01:49:23.759]  There's no doubt that there is a, well that's why they have the gladiator fights free to the public was to condition people to see innocent folks being torn limb from limb and being dominated by the agents of the state.
[01:49:24.179 --> 01:49:25.899]  This is all being done by design.
[01:49:27.379 --> 01:49:38.922]  Jim, stay there one more segment with us and I'm going to let you go but I want to reschedule you sometime this week or next week because I wanted to talk to you about Bilderberg and I wanted to talk to you about all the new JFK stuff that's coming out as well as all the new 9-11 developments.
[01:49:40.285 --> 01:49:43.933]  Listeners, your calls are coming up as well, and I will get into the new news.
[01:49:44.695 --> 01:49:46.700]  Was Israel involved in one of the terror attacks?
[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:48.023]  That's out of the Jerusalem Post.
[01:49:57.145 --> 01:50:02.635]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.996 --> 01:50:10.569]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.317 --> 01:50:18.381]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.781 --> 01:50:30.207]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.507 --> 01:50:34.430]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:36.391]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.731 --> 01:50:40.513]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:56.064 --> 01:51:59.768]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:52:00.088 --> 01:52:02.290]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[01:52:09.177 --> 01:52:14.002]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:14.262 --> 01:52:23.287]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:52:56.503 --> 01:53:00.465]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[01:53:00.705 --> 01:53:04.647]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[01:53:05.567 --> 01:53:10.050]  Even your emotions haven't let go in so much space.
[01:53:10.450 --> 01:53:18.634]  And when you're out there, but out there, yeah I was out of touch.
[01:53:19.194 --> 01:53:21.955]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[01:53:26.565 --> 01:53:31.348]  Hey Jim, what do you think of our own Rick Perry going to the Bilderberg Group?
[01:53:32.309 --> 01:53:38.873]  Well, I mean, he's just showing his true colors, but I tell you what, hey, maybe you can confirm this for me.
[01:53:38.933 --> 01:53:52.061]  I understand the Texas Legislature has either passed, or at least it's up for passage, a measure that would stop the construction on the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:53:52.101 --> 01:53:52.701]  Is that true?
[01:53:53.599 --> 01:53:57.341]  Yes, and there's a revolt trying to throw out the leadership who's trying to block them.
[01:53:58.642 --> 01:53:59.082]  Uh-huh.
[01:54:00.403 --> 01:54:06.667]  So there is an actual revolt because they all know it's political suicide to do it, and that's probably one reason he got dispatched there.
[01:54:06.727 --> 01:54:11.009]  Jim, I gotta get you back up later this week, but you just brought up something during the break.
[01:54:11.049 --> 01:54:15.112]  I was talking to you about your new book, which I didn't even know you were writing on this.
[01:54:15.132 --> 01:54:18.493]  I, in my own research, kept running into this.
[01:54:18.874 --> 01:54:20.975]  In a nutshell, tell folks about the new book that's coming out.
[01:54:21.554 --> 01:54:43.223]  Well, I hate to go too far, because even though my editor and my publisher has assured me they're not going to cancel this one on me like they did my 9-11 book, I'm not holding my breath, because once they see the evidence and the information that I've compiled, they very well may just stop it again.
[01:54:43.303 --> 01:54:49.666]  But right now, I'm working on a book, and the working title is The Rise of the Fourth Reich.
[01:54:50.506 --> 01:55:09.880]  Because modern-day America is more and more paralleling not only the events of Nazi Germany, but falling into some of the same habits, and you can see the same techniques, the same methodology that's taking place.
[01:55:11.221 --> 01:55:18.006]  I was astounded the other day to read Georgie Ann Geyer's article in the Dallas Morning News where she talked about
[01:55:18.732 --> 01:55:38.615]  Rich Texans going up to Washington to visit their friend George W. in the White House and said they barely got one question out before he began to go on an hour long rant and whining and thumping his chest and saying people don't understand me but I know I'm right, I know I'm right, I'm the president, I'm the president, I'm the president!
[01:55:39.176 --> 01:55:50.703]  And it sounded like one of Hitler's tirades in the bunker when he was just lost in delusion and lashing out at anyone who tried to bring reality to him.
[01:55:52.124 --> 01:55:52.945]  It was amazing.
[01:55:53.325 --> 01:55:56.747]  Well, the stuff you told me is really powerful, and that's what I've confirmed on my own.
[01:55:57.928 --> 01:55:59.369]  But it goes back even further.
[01:55:59.389 --> 01:56:03.051]  You know, Maximilian was a German prince who ran Mexico.
[01:56:04.382 --> 01:56:07.185]  And then you know that Mexico attacked the U.S.
[01:56:07.205 --> 01:56:15.291]  during World War I, and they've kept all this real quiet, and so now I found out that's why Bush is doing this, and it goes back.
[01:56:15.992 --> 01:56:22.797]  And you know the Nazis tried to get Mexico to attack during World War II, and now I've found documents on this.
[01:56:22.877 --> 01:56:23.938]  Man, we're in trouble, Jim.
[01:56:24.298 --> 01:56:31.708]  Well, that's actually what got the United States into World War I was the so-called Zimmerman note.
[01:56:31.868 --> 01:56:41.401]  Okay, Zimmerman was the German ambassador to Mexico during World War I and somehow they either contrived or they managed to get hold of a real
[01:56:42.242 --> 01:56:42.983]  We're good to go.
[01:57:01.147 --> 01:57:09.290]  Which was a munitions-filled ship heading into a war zone that the Germans had warned everybody.
[01:57:09.330 --> 01:57:17.674]  They even took out ads in the newspaper saying, don't travel on this because we consider this a wartime ship and we will attack it.
[01:57:18.054 --> 01:57:24.897]  And yet, only one newspaper in the whole country was either dumb enough or naive enough to actually run the ad.
[01:57:24.957 --> 01:57:28.358]  And so sure enough, they sank the Lusitania over in water.
[01:57:28.498 --> 01:57:30.219]  Tell you what, I've got to hear the rest of it.
[01:57:30.239 --> 01:57:30.559]  Stay there.
[01:57:33.675 --> 01:57:38.563]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.127 --> 01:57:50.767]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.428 --> 01:57:52.509]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.210 --> 01:57:54.411]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.971 --> 01:57:55.812]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.533 --> 01:57:57.493]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.094 --> 01:58:02.058]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.298 --> 01:58:06.442]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.984 --> 01:58:13.769]  Within two weeks of the United States entering World War I,
[01:58:15.613 --> 01:58:24.900]  Mexican paramilitary forces attacked South Texas, killing 23 Americans in one night, including several entire families, including small children.
[01:58:26.061 --> 01:58:29.704]  See, the Germans had already run Mexico for more than a decade.
[01:58:30.945 --> 01:58:44.035]  After that, they had run the technocrats in the 1890s through, during massive German industrialization, through to the start of World War I. By the way, this is University of Texas, this is University of Mexico City.
[01:58:44.688 --> 01:58:50.056]  You can read Spanish, you can go read it, but I've gotten translations done of it and I've also read the English translations.
[01:58:51.357 --> 01:58:55.363]  This is mainline history.
[01:58:55.723 --> 01:59:01.071]  Most of Mexican infrastructure was built by the Austrians and the Germans under the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.
[01:59:02.330 --> 01:59:08.455]  When Spain pulled out, and then Santa Ana and others fell, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire moved in.
[01:59:09.336 --> 01:59:16.703]  Just type in Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico, and you'll see the big paintings of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, you know, King of Mexico.
[01:59:17.383 --> 01:59:23.849]  And so that's why, in World War I, the Germans had a plan that if we attacked them, that they would attack the Southwest.
[01:59:23.929 --> 01:59:25.450]  The operation was launched.
[01:59:26.151 --> 01:59:27.953]  But again, they don't teach that in history books.
[01:59:28.013 --> 01:59:29.394]  It's kept very quiet.
[01:59:30.183 --> 01:59:34.285]  Well now, that's why Mecha is very anti-semitic.
[01:59:34.765 --> 01:59:36.306]  That's why Mecha says the Southwest.
[01:59:36.326 --> 01:59:39.287]  That was actually all Austrian propaganda.
[01:59:39.908 --> 01:59:44.510]  And again, I'm not... Again, then you've got the whole British arm of the New World War here, who I believe is even more powerful.
[01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:46.251]  And they're all interlocking now.
[01:59:46.651 --> 01:59:49.632]  It's just the globalists are using Mexico to bring down the U.S.
[01:59:49.933 --> 01:59:51.033]  And they'll probably succeed.
[01:59:51.313 --> 01:59:52.854]  Jim, you want to, in closing, comment on that?
[01:59:54.715 --> 01:59:55.035]  Yes.
[01:59:55.475 --> 01:59:57.036]  You're absolutely right.
[01:59:57.848 --> 02:00:18.925]  And you know it even goes back further goes back to the war between the states when Maximilian was in charge in Mexico and the British, the bulk of their forces were in Canada and according to Otto von Bismarck the whole American Civil War was simply a plan by the European bankers to
[02:00:19.966 --> 02:00:20.647]  We're good to go.
[02:00:39.236 --> 02:00:46.046]  Abraham Lincoln pulled off a very shrewd political move in late 1863 in the middle of war.
[02:00:46.246 --> 02:00:55.499]  He suddenly decided that slavery was an issue and issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which was actually pretty much nothing because
[02:00:56.059 --> 02:00:59.241]  It did not free any of the slaves in other U.S.
[02:00:59.321 --> 02:00:59.921]  territory.
[02:01:00.281 --> 02:01:04.444]  It simply said the slaves in the states that were under insurrection were free.
[02:01:04.464 --> 02:01:19.092]  Well, of course, he had no control there, so it was meaningless, except it was a brilliant propaganda move because he then knew that the populations in France and Britain who had only ended slavery 30 years before, which was within living memory,
[02:01:19.532 --> 02:01:20.493]  He sent his fleet.
[02:01:40.755 --> 02:01:41.736]  He sent two fleets.
[02:01:41.876 --> 02:01:54.707]  He anchored one off San Francisco and one off Virginia, and he let it be known under the table that if Britain and France were to come in on the side of the South, that he was going to come in on the side of the North.
[02:01:54.767 --> 02:01:59.932]  And by the way, he did that because he knew that Russia was next, and they did get him just 40-something years later.
[02:02:00.192 --> 02:02:00.833]  That's true.
[02:02:00.973 --> 02:02:07.979]  He had already learned that Britain and France were already plotting to break up the Russian Empire, and that's why he was opposed to them.
[02:02:08.519 --> 02:02:23.185]  So, once he pledged his support to the North, if the British and French came in on the side of the South, the World Bankers were suddenly faced with World War I 50 years before they had planned it.
[02:02:23.645 --> 02:02:25.026]  So, they had to back off.
[02:02:26.246 --> 02:02:27.247]  What the heck's going on?
[02:02:27.667 --> 02:02:32.369]  Well, you know, Alex, what this tells us is, is that they can be stopped.
[02:02:33.798 --> 02:02:35.239]  Absolutely, that's what I was gonna say.
[02:02:35.579 --> 02:02:38.161]  Jim, let me get you back up for a full hour later this week, my friend.
[02:02:38.601 --> 02:02:38.981]  Alright.
[02:02:39.602 --> 02:02:40.582]  Fire out your website.
[02:02:42.263 --> 02:02:43.764]  Uh, jimmars.com.
[02:02:43.784 --> 02:02:46.205]  J-I-M-M-A-R-R-S dot com.
[02:02:46.486 --> 02:02:52.149]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.509 --> 02:02:54.450]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.811 --> 02:03:02.415]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:03.146 --> 02:03:10.210]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.590 --> 02:03:22.016]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.336 --> 02:03:25.838]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.299 --> 02:03:28.220]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:32.402]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.916 --> 02:03:49.098]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:49.118 --> 02:03:53.181]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:53.301 --> 02:03:55.863]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:55.923 --> 02:03:58.265]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:58.445 --> 02:04:06.891]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:06.951 --> 02:04:08.272]  The Brookie light is different.
[02:04:08.392 --> 02:04:12.415]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:12.415 --> 02:04:12.915]  We're good to go!

[02:04:43.195 --> 02:04:44.436]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:47.535 --> 02:04:49.496]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[02:04:49.976 --> 02:04:52.637]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[02:04:53.418 --> 02:04:54.538]  For a while, anyway.
[02:04:55.058 --> 02:04:58.220]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:01.181]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[02:05:01.481 --> 02:05:04.982]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:05:05.343 --> 02:05:07.583]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:05:08.144 --> 02:05:08.844]  What's the name again?
[02:05:08.864 --> 02:05:10.245]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:05:10.625 --> 02:05:11.445]  It's CalX.
[02:05:11.765 --> 02:05:11.985]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[02:05:14.301 --> 02:05:15.982]  What makes Calex Ointment so different?
[02:05:16.183 --> 02:05:24.509]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:05:25.550 --> 02:05:30.114]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Calex Ointment.
[02:05:30.334 --> 02:05:39.441]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B Grocery Stores, Medicine Shop Pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:05:40.141 --> 02:05:41.262]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[02:05:41.302 --> 02:05:41.983]  I'll be right back.
[02:05:42.243 --> 02:05:43.164]  I'm getting some Calex.
[02:05:45.881 --> 02:05:51.484]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:55.727 --> 02:06:03.811]  Money is made by private families owning the central banks that issue the money, that issue the credit for the governments to print the money.
[02:06:04.972 --> 02:06:10.395]  Power is gained by alliances and treachery and imperial invasions.
[02:06:11.036 --> 02:06:13.537]  The globalists have built up the US military.
[02:06:14.736 --> 02:06:23.282]  To grab land, to steal property, to destroy nations, so the IMF and World Bank can come in and give them loans to rebuild their shattered countries.
[02:06:24.123 --> 02:06:26.285]  We're talking 30 to 40 in some cases.
[02:06:27.245 --> 02:06:30.928]  On average it's about 30 percentage points interest.
[02:06:32.689 --> 02:06:34.171]  This is unbelievable.
[02:06:35.512 --> 02:06:38.694]  And the whole time they're undermining the United States for its fault.
[02:06:40.464 --> 02:06:48.166]  I mean, imagine being the average Mexican from Mexico who thinks the Southwest belongs to Mexico, that hates the United States, that's been taught that in school.
[02:06:50.006 --> 02:06:52.227]  Don't they wonder why the government of the U.S.
[02:06:52.407 --> 02:06:53.567]  wants them to be legalized?
[02:06:53.847 --> 02:06:59.609]  Don't they wonder why the corporations roll out the red carpet and why the police are told don't arrest them when they don't have IDs?
[02:07:01.289 --> 02:07:03.850]  Why, by fiat, they're already legalized?
[02:07:04.670 --> 02:07:06.070]  By fiat, they already have amnesty.
[02:07:07.170 --> 02:07:09.211]  You see, do you know about Maximilian, your leader?
[02:07:09.952 --> 02:07:11.453]  Do you know about British intelligence?
[02:07:12.133 --> 02:07:13.653]  Do you know about German intelligence?
[02:07:14.934 --> 02:07:18.495]  Do you know about the massacres that were committed during World War I on the southwest border?
[02:07:19.595 --> 02:07:20.556]  No, you don't know that!
[02:07:22.236 --> 02:07:26.698]  I've tried to talk to Chicano professors, and man, they're so racist, folks.
[02:07:26.718 --> 02:07:27.598]  They're so hateful.
[02:07:27.878 --> 02:07:28.899]  They'll start cussing at you.
[02:07:28.939 --> 02:07:35.221]  They can't even... They'll start calling you names and giggling and calling you gringo and whitey and saying, you don't like that, do you?
[02:07:35.501 --> 02:07:38.242]  I'm going, listen, man, your name calling means nothing to me.
[02:07:39.372 --> 02:07:41.374]  Literally, I'm scientifically talking to you.
[02:07:42.274 --> 02:07:44.556]  I'm saying, do you understand you're being set up?
[02:07:44.896 --> 02:07:46.878]  Do you understand you're peons for a reason?
[02:07:47.158 --> 02:07:51.802]  Because the New World Order's been running game on you since you were founded, 500 years ago.
[02:07:55.245 --> 02:07:59.148]  Everybody else are peon slaves because the New World Order runs you.
[02:07:59.568 --> 02:08:08.575]  China, Nigeria, Mexico, Venezuela and Iraq, El Salvador,
[02:08:09.702 --> 02:08:10.322]  Narokawa.
[02:08:10.643 --> 02:08:11.963]  That's I guess the way the Indians say it.
[02:08:12.584 --> 02:08:13.224]  Nicaragua.
[02:08:18.507 --> 02:08:21.229]  I mean, I'm just sitting here watching these people do this!
[02:08:21.289 --> 02:08:23.230]  Can't you play chess, folks?
[02:08:23.751 --> 02:08:25.291]  Can't you see what they're doing?
[02:08:25.312 --> 02:08:30.855]  I mean, let me ask these... I knew I forgot something earlier.
[02:08:30.875 --> 02:08:34.057]  This is one of the days where my head's spinning.
[02:08:34.077 --> 02:08:35.558]  I got like 50 things I want to cover here.
[02:08:36.278 --> 02:08:39.200]  Last night, I called into a talk show that was talking about
[02:08:40.023 --> 02:08:43.385]  The Austin police shot somebody else yesterday in the back, running away from them.
[02:08:43.445 --> 02:08:44.365]  The routine behavior.
[02:08:45.006 --> 02:08:46.767]  It's totally disgusting and out of control.
[02:08:48.128 --> 02:08:53.431]  But I said that that needs to be dealt with by the people of Austin, the county, the city, and by the police chief.
[02:08:53.851 --> 02:08:57.693]  And we need to have a good police chief that will do their job, instead of the police running this town.
[02:09:01.715 --> 02:09:08.199]  And I said, the feds have no business being in here and doing this, and they had an NAACP called in, locally, and he said, well, Mr. Jones is wrong.
[02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:16.545]  You know, the feds free black people, and I love the feds basically, and the feds are going to save us.
[02:09:16.765 --> 02:09:18.987]  They're coming in federalizing Austin like they do everywhere else.
[02:09:25.153 --> 02:09:30.777]  The feds don't come in when they arrest every Christian protester at an outfest in Philadelphia.
[02:09:30.837 --> 02:09:36.522]  No, in contrary, they were running it there with their federal liaisons from past trouble Philadelphia had had.
[02:09:36.903 --> 02:09:38.224]  See, it just gets worse once they're in.
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:49.204]  Or they don't come in in Seattle where anybody protesting the illegal aliens on May Day was arrested, but the illegal aliens could run around assaulting whoever they wanted.
[02:09:50.925 --> 02:09:59.249]  Now they do send the feds in when the illegals think they can throw bottles at cops and the cops finally don't follow orders and shoot back with rubber bullets.
[02:09:59.869 --> 02:10:02.891]  But now they'll all be fired and put in the stocks.
[02:10:03.371 --> 02:10:03.871]  No, no, no, no.
[02:10:03.891 --> 02:10:05.432]  You don't do that to the preciouses.
[02:10:05.872 --> 02:10:07.473]  They're part of the larger plan.
[02:10:07.873 --> 02:10:09.174]  They're welcomed in here.
[02:10:10.032 --> 02:10:12.454]  It's the citizens that it's open season on.
[02:10:13.515 --> 02:10:14.056]  You got it?
[02:10:14.576 --> 02:10:19.581]  Feed on them, shove them around, write them tickets, take their children, tax them.
[02:10:19.841 --> 02:10:23.064]  They're the dumb idiots raised from birth to be our milk cows.
[02:10:23.744 --> 02:10:24.665]  Do you understand that?
[02:10:25.646 --> 02:10:31.672]  You don't leave the Lurie Conquistas forged by the Austrian-Hungarian Empire to bring down America.
[02:10:31.912 --> 02:10:33.073]  You leave them alone.
[02:10:33.313 --> 02:10:34.154]  Do you understand?
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:48.464]  And you've got all these factions and all what these empires set in motion now coming together today.
[02:10:50.545 --> 02:10:52.367]  And then that goes into how institutions work.
[02:10:53.127 --> 02:11:05.815]  The Austrian Hungarian Empire set the program in motion and things that are old, things that have deep roots, things that run on rails, operations that run on rails, and I use that figuratively, have a power, a dynamic
[02:11:08.847 --> 02:11:09.907]  Energy source to them.
[02:11:10.468 --> 02:11:12.369]  Things gain power over time.
[02:11:12.649 --> 02:11:14.230]  Almost gravitational power.
[02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:26.136]  And so I'm not saying the Austrian-Hungarian Empire controls the mythos, the myth, the archetype that was forged by the Austrian-Hungarian-German Empire of the Mexican Empire.
[02:11:27.037 --> 02:11:35.201]  But now that has been co-opted by the Ford Foundation and the Liberation Theology Technicians and literally they planted this myth
[02:11:37.538 --> 02:11:43.920]  Like it's some type of Dune Saga, and this is the Fedekeen, or the, uh, Fremen.
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:56.644]  And now they're all among us, on the radio stations are saying, we're taking over, we're gonna get them, we're gonna kill them, it's the old memory, the old plan, kill them in the dead of night, take over, burn their cities.
[02:11:59.424 --> 02:12:01.165]  And it's all financed by the New World Order.
[02:12:04.989 --> 02:12:06.452]  And I have the history.
[02:12:06.893 --> 02:12:08.395]  I mean, I have the documents.
[02:12:08.415 --> 02:12:09.758]  This is admitted.
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:17.752]  Let me tell you something, Mexicans, those that love Mexico and wave your flags, they give your children those inoculations, don't they?
[02:12:18.675 --> 02:12:20.416]  They give you the GMO food, don't they?
[02:12:20.976 --> 02:12:29.220]  Your masters don't care about you any more than they care about the American people, and they flap American flags in our face and say, go kill Iraqis.
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:34.642]  And we say, yes sir, boss, like some type of trained monkeys, and we go follow the orders.
[02:12:36.983 --> 02:12:40.244]  And they flap that Mexican flag, and frankly, what is the Mexican flag?
[02:12:40.584 --> 02:12:44.246]  I know of no other flag that's got animals killing each other on the cover of it.
[02:12:45.587 --> 02:12:46.387]  Some Aztec
[02:12:47.345 --> 02:12:49.906]  Demon symbol on the front of it.
[02:12:49.926 --> 02:12:51.787]  That's what the cactuses really symbolize.
[02:12:52.387 --> 02:12:53.968]  Is a human having his heart torn out.
[02:12:54.228 --> 02:12:55.828]  That's what the original flag really had.
[02:12:56.088 --> 02:12:57.809]  Was a hawk tearing somebody's heart out.
[02:13:02.011 --> 02:13:03.411]  Hearts that grow out of the ground.
[02:13:03.431 --> 02:13:06.792]  That's bottom line Aztec mythos.
[02:13:07.673 --> 02:13:08.333]  This is evil!
[02:13:09.855 --> 02:13:17.177]  So if you want to get played, and you always want to get beat, and you always want to be manipulated but feel good, then don't listen to me!
[02:13:19.137 --> 02:13:22.078]  But I've done the studying, folks, and I just can't believe what I've found.
[02:13:22.438 --> 02:13:23.578]  It's so bizarre.
[02:13:25.019 --> 02:13:28.259]  And I've already digressed, but here's the head of the NAACP here locally.
[02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:30.260]  The feds are going to save us.
[02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:34.541]  Oh, okay, okay, so we go to the feds every time there's a problem instead of changing things here locally.
[02:13:35.692 --> 02:13:45.400]  And then the Feds burn down Waco and Ruby Ridge and run their black ops everywhere and let CPS in New York grab black kids and feed them pesticides and drugs till they die.
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:46.380]  And that's okay.
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:47.601]  You don't get upset about that.
[02:13:48.742 --> 02:13:52.585]  You get upset about what you're told to get upset about and the Feds are going to save you.
[02:13:52.906 --> 02:13:54.407]  The Feds aren't going to do anything for you.
[02:13:55.448 --> 02:13:58.650]  By the way, the Feds didn't save you and you didn't get your rights from the Feds.
[02:13:58.950 --> 02:14:01.032]  You got your rights when you started getting violent.
[02:14:01.539 --> 02:14:14.246]  You got your rights when you started refusing to be slaves, and then they came in and co-opted your movement when you had strong black communities and broke up your family-owned businesses and your communities, and you've gone from 10% illegitimacy to over 90%.
[02:14:14.666 --> 02:14:19.469]  The feds have destroyed you, Mr. NAACP.
[02:14:20.669 --> 02:14:21.570]  But again, it doesn't matter.
[02:14:21.850 --> 02:14:23.651]  What feels good is what matters.
[02:14:23.951 --> 02:14:26.933]  Thinking you know is what matters, not knowing.
[02:14:28.894 --> 02:14:32.017]  All right, I'm going to shut up because we've only got a few minutes left because we've got another guest coming up.
[02:14:33.078 --> 02:14:40.364]  Luke Radowsky, strength force leader in the Info War, out there having serious effects.
[02:14:40.404 --> 02:14:49.632]  He went to the Democratic Convention, not convention, Democratic debate last night and got some really good jewels for us.
[02:14:50.793 --> 02:14:51.814]  Luke, this is amazing.
[02:14:52.074 --> 02:14:52.775]  Tell us what happened.
[02:14:53.516 --> 02:14:54.136]  How you doing Alex?
[02:14:54.196 --> 02:14:55.037]  I'm doing here great.
[02:14:55.277 --> 02:15:01.379]  We were here at the Democratic Debate here last night and as we came in we saw a whole bunch of Not 11 Truthers.
[02:15:01.719 --> 02:15:05.600]  We saw a whole lot of Ron Paul supporters and we literally took over the place.
[02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:06.701]  The place didn't know what hit them.
[02:15:06.981 --> 02:15:16.464]  I mean the Ron Paul and the Not 11 Truth people out here at the Democratic Debate, we basically outnumbered everyone except for the Hillary and Obama campaign.
[02:15:16.744 --> 02:15:19.385]  I mean we launched a coordinator attack on the candidates.
[02:15:19.705 --> 02:15:25.548]  And I'm telling you right now, we did a true squad on Bill Richardson, on Senator Joe Biden, and Dave Gergen.
[02:15:25.768 --> 02:15:37.293]  And not only that, this morning, our guys in New York, because I'm here in New Hampshire, we're doing a big road trip to New Hampshire, my guys in New York also hit up Hillary Clinton, did a true squad on her also.
[02:15:37.613 --> 02:15:44.657]  Now, what we did, I snuck into the spin room here in CNN's room at the press conference, and I went up to Bill Richardson.
[02:15:45.197 --> 02:15:47.438]  And I walked up to Bill Richardson and I told him,
[02:15:48.362 --> 02:15:52.244]  You gave the keynote speech at the Bohemian Grove Club, sir.
[02:15:52.505 --> 02:15:54.006]  And I asked him all of his business there.
[02:15:54.366 --> 02:15:57.248]  As soon as I asked him that question, he left all the press.
[02:15:57.348 --> 02:15:58.188]  He waved me down.
[02:15:58.448 --> 02:15:59.689]  He got redder than he was.
[02:15:59.869 --> 02:16:00.510]  And he left.
[02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:03.011]  He actually left the premises.
[02:16:03.471 --> 02:16:06.073]  And stood right away from me and the media.
[02:16:06.293 --> 02:16:09.235]  And I told him, do you know they're shipping male prostitutes there, sir?
[02:16:09.275 --> 02:16:10.216]  And he just started running.
[02:16:10.656 --> 02:16:12.217]  And I had some security guards following us.
[02:16:12.537 --> 02:16:14.038]  Now you've had him started running.
[02:16:14.858 --> 02:16:15.719]  After that, we saw David Gergen.
[02:16:15.739 --> 02:16:17.900]  All the way down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:18.881]  Good job.
[02:16:18.901 --> 02:16:19.602]  Yeah, he was running.
[02:16:20.202 --> 02:16:21.043]  It gets even better.
[02:16:21.183 --> 02:16:22.704]  Because we ran up to David Gergen.
[02:16:22.864 --> 02:16:27.048]  We were looking for David Gergen because he was all over CNN talking about, you know, all this crap he always does.
[02:16:27.448 --> 02:16:28.849]  And we found him.
[02:16:29.129 --> 02:16:29.990]  And I walked up to him.
[02:16:30.050 --> 02:16:30.610]  I shook his hand.
[02:16:30.630 --> 02:16:31.671]  I was like, hey, David Gergen.
[02:16:32.111 --> 02:16:34.553]  Hey, I heard you, you know, you went to the Bohemian Globe.
[02:16:34.593 --> 02:16:36.115]  Can you tell us more about that, sir?
[02:16:36.615 --> 02:16:38.657]  And all he said, oh, it's a really fun place.
[02:16:38.677 --> 02:16:40.118]  And I was like, what do you mean fun?
[02:16:40.178 --> 02:16:43.000]  And I told him that American people deserve truth and justice.
[02:16:43.688 --> 02:16:48.593]  We're not getting any truth and justice when we have people like you meeting at secret places like the Bohemian Grove Club, sir.
[02:16:49.154 --> 02:16:50.875]  And then he was like, it's a very fun place.
[02:16:50.995 --> 02:16:52.457]  He told me, I don't know nothing about it.
[02:16:52.757 --> 02:16:54.258]  And then he put his hand on me.
[02:16:54.739 --> 02:16:59.243]  And he looked me in the face and he winked at me and said, you should come there someday, son.
[02:16:59.343 --> 02:17:00.905]  And he went right in my face.
[02:17:00.945 --> 02:17:02.486]  He stepped up close to me and did this.
[02:17:02.566 --> 02:17:03.948]  It was like he was making a move on me.
[02:17:04.228 --> 02:17:05.549]  I was like, sir, I don't want to be there.
[02:17:05.749 --> 02:17:07.531]  There should be male prostitutes in there, sir.
[02:17:09.033 --> 02:17:10.473]  And he said, you don't know what you're talking about.
[02:17:10.493 --> 02:17:12.674]  And I was like, sir, do you worship Moloch, sir?
[02:17:12.714 --> 02:17:13.614]  Do you worship Moloch?
[02:17:13.634 --> 02:17:13.954]  You know what?
[02:17:14.234 --> 02:17:19.256]  When I was asking him if he worships Moloch, he just ran inside and he had security guards pick us out.
[02:17:19.596 --> 02:17:26.638]  But if this was all on live TV on We Are Changed, we have a live webcam that we were broadcasting this live.
[02:17:26.938 --> 02:17:29.239]  And we're going to do it again tomorrow at the Republican base.
[02:17:29.439 --> 02:17:30.379]  But this even gets better.
[02:17:30.399 --> 02:17:34.220]  Because we went up to Senator Joe Biden's press conference where he was doing it.
[02:17:34.740 --> 02:17:35.440]  Stay there.
[02:17:35.661 --> 02:17:36.581]  Stay there, Luke.
[02:17:38.104 --> 02:17:39.404]  It's just getting too good here.
[02:17:39.444 --> 02:17:42.245]  This is absolute, total luxuriation.
[02:17:42.625 --> 02:17:43.425]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.046 --> 02:17:50.347]  If you've ever wanted to grow the absolute best tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting news.

[02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:04.171]  What does this mean in the garden?

[02:18:15.660 --> 02:18:18.703]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[02:18:18.843 --> 02:18:21.425]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[02:18:21.645 --> 02:18:28.651]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.

[02:19:51.023 --> 02:19:58.329]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:19:58.489 --> 02:20:09.118]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:20:09.318 --> 02:20:13.862]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:20:14.142 --> 02:20:19.125]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:20:19.345 --> 02:20:22.287]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:22.507 --> 02:20:32.373]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:21:59.236 --> 02:22:06.301]  Piercing the veil, getting into the press room, taking it to Bill Richardson.
[02:22:07.121 --> 02:22:09.803]  The Karl Rove of four administrations, David Gergen.
[02:22:11.764 --> 02:22:17.868]  But back in New York, Hillary Clinton got confronted.
[02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:20.340]  And tell us what happened there.
[02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:22.321]  This is huge breaking news.
[02:22:22.361 --> 02:22:35.624]  And by the way, Fox took the InfoWars.com footage shot by our reporter, Luke Rudowsky, for WeAreChange.org, in association with his organization, and they put it on Fox and MSNBC, didn't give us credit, nothing.
[02:22:35.924 --> 02:22:42.126]  That's why we've got to plaster our websites all over it, where they either can't use it or they have to give us credit.
[02:22:42.506 --> 02:22:46.807]  Because it's fine, they can use it, they've just got to have the website so people can then hear our side of things.
[02:22:47.087 --> 02:22:48.347]  Luke, tell us what happened with Hillary.
[02:22:49.364 --> 02:22:50.344]  Oh, it was really interesting.
[02:22:50.584 --> 02:22:55.366]  We're here in New York and we set up a Troop Squad, organized, coordinated Troop Squad on her.
[02:22:55.846 --> 02:22:57.466]  And we're here in New York, we got some other troops.
[02:22:57.486 --> 02:23:02.968]  You got Tom Foti, Nate Evans, and Gary from WeAreChanged.org to go hit her up to do a Troop Squad with her.
[02:23:03.228 --> 02:23:08.249]  Now my friend, Nate Evans, walked up to Hillary Clinton as she was coming into New York City for a fundraiser.
[02:23:08.669 --> 02:23:12.050]  And he just clearly said, Queen Hillary, to get her attention.
[02:23:12.390 --> 02:23:15.631]  And he was going to ask her some questions about 9-11 and her Bilderberg connection.
[02:23:16.095 --> 02:23:23.837]  And before he said Queen Hillary, after he said Queen Hillary, he had security guards, most likely Secret Service guys, you know, these guys in suits, these thugs in suits.
[02:23:23.877 --> 02:23:24.497]  Yeah, she's got them.
[02:23:24.517 --> 02:23:24.757]  Literally.
[02:23:25.337 --> 02:23:26.857]  Take them off, off his feet.
[02:23:27.157 --> 02:23:27.738]  Assault him.
[02:23:27.798 --> 02:23:29.098]  Physically put their hands on him.
[02:23:29.418 --> 02:23:30.778]  Physically abuse him.
[02:23:31.238 --> 02:23:36.119]  Took him, put him, lifted him up, by his clothes, and threw him out the event.
[02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:37.860]  Threw him out the public spot.
[02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:38.920]  And they were chasing him now.
[02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:40.841]  And this was reported by Nate Evans.
[02:23:41.901 --> 02:23:42.701]  From WeAreChanged.org.
[02:23:43.923 --> 02:23:48.925]  And that's Nate Evans, and of course we've had Tom on many times, but tell folks Tom's full name.
[02:23:49.766 --> 02:23:56.429]  Tom Forty was also there, Gary was also there, Tom Forty asked her about a question about 9-11 and if she's gonna support a new investigation.
[02:23:56.789 --> 02:23:58.210]  She totally ignored him.
[02:23:58.410 --> 02:24:03.012]  She got the security thugs and it was, it was, it was, what else was there?
[02:24:03.052 --> 02:24:10.616]  Cover headline, Hillary Clinton has secret service, assault 9-11 truther, for asking questions.
[02:24:11.263 --> 02:24:12.646]  That should be a very good headline.
[02:24:12.666 --> 02:24:13.707]  We should call Nate Evans up.
[02:24:13.728 --> 02:24:18.115]  We should have him live on here to tell him exactly what we're doing.
[02:24:18.155 --> 02:24:19.418]  He's at work right now, isn't he?
[02:24:20.139 --> 02:24:22.844]  He should be available for, you know, five ten minutes for a little comment.
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:25.761]  But it's just important to know that we're not going to stop these Twitch Cops.
[02:24:25.801 --> 02:24:33.943]  We're here in New Hampshire right now, and I want to tell anybody in the Tri-State area, if you see this debate, anybody in the area, to come here.
[02:24:34.263 --> 02:24:41.485]  We're doing a live support for Ron Paul here in the parking lot outside of the Republican National Debate.
[02:24:41.785 --> 02:24:44.106]  And we want to take as many people out there as possible.
[02:24:44.306 --> 02:24:49.427]  We're going to have a live video feed of that tomorrow on WeAreChange.org, and even today, later on today, we're going to have a live feed.
[02:24:49.447 --> 02:24:51.248]  Now, who are you streaming that live feed through?
[02:24:52.196 --> 02:24:53.937]  We're feeding it through WeAreChange.org.
[02:24:53.957 --> 02:24:59.479]  It's the software that my friend Matt Lapace hooked up for us and he's hooking us up with a live webcam.
[02:24:59.719 --> 02:25:01.720]  So what you're doing... Here's the deal.
[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:02.380]  Here's the deal.
[02:25:03.061 --> 02:25:05.482]  If we plug it, which we've done, it's going to be crashed.
[02:25:07.097 --> 02:25:17.541]  I mean, I could show everybody, we could just wait and see what happens tomorrow, but I'm going to try to grab that and boost that and add another three or four thousand streams up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:25:17.581 --> 02:25:24.724]  We'll do our best to interface and grab your feed for PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and retransmit it.
[02:25:25.424 --> 02:25:28.205]  Or we can just let it hammer your server down into oblivion.
[02:25:28.225 --> 02:25:30.486]  Because, you know, video takes in trouble.
[02:25:31.126 --> 02:25:33.567]  You let us know, we'll give you anything you want.
[02:25:33.707 --> 02:25:35.608]  Well, I'm not even sure our servers can handle it.
[02:25:36.663 --> 02:25:39.585]  I mean, if you publicize something, I don't know.
[02:25:40.285 --> 02:25:40.825]  We'll try.
[02:25:40.845 --> 02:25:42.026]  We'll see what happens.
[02:25:42.406 --> 02:25:43.246]  We'll see what we're doing.
[02:25:43.306 --> 02:25:48.729]  Also, later on today, we're going to be doing a live video feed from Ed and Elaine Brown's house here in New Hampshire.
[02:25:48.769 --> 02:25:50.910]  We're doing an interview live with them on the internet.
[02:25:51.270 --> 02:25:56.292]  And it's really new technology that we just started using, which is really effective, because one, it's for our security.
[02:25:56.732 --> 02:25:59.814]  And anything happens to us, you know, people are going to see it live on this webcam.
[02:26:00.228 --> 02:26:01.349]  And two, it's entertaining.
[02:26:01.409 --> 02:26:01.969]  It's live.
[02:26:02.009 --> 02:26:03.250]  You never know what could happen.
[02:26:03.270 --> 02:26:10.915]  And yesterday we were doing it live at the Democratic Convention, and you could see us confronting Bill Richardson, Senator Joe Biden, David Gergen, and everything was live.
[02:26:10.935 --> 02:26:13.016]  And that's one beautiful thing about this thing.
[02:26:14.978 --> 02:26:15.618]  Absolutely.
[02:26:15.678 --> 02:26:16.499]  It's the way to go.
[02:26:16.519 --> 02:26:22.863]  So what, you tap into the wireless internet of the facility, you have a laptop in your backpack, and then it transmits out.
[02:26:23.462 --> 02:26:38.333]  You know, we have a laptop and a broadband internet connection to a Verizon wireless card, and we use that, we plug it in, into the laptop, and then, and then it automatically streams live broadband, uh, you know, the internet, automatically, no matter, uh, Wi-Fi or no Wi-Fi, it automatically gets it off there, special things we got.
[02:26:40.359 --> 02:26:41.800]  Well, that's exciting, my friend.
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:43.181]  And again, I can only commend you.
[02:26:43.561 --> 02:26:45.863]  This is the type of action that's going to save this country.
[02:26:46.223 --> 02:26:48.584]  So, Gergen tried to get in your space.
[02:26:48.604 --> 02:26:49.325]  He did that with me.
[02:26:49.345 --> 02:26:53.548]  You know, because he thinks, because he's literally almost seven feet tall, that intimidates people.
[02:26:54.408 --> 02:26:56.910]  Yeah, he literally came up to me and he was pretty tall.
[02:26:56.930 --> 02:26:58.631]  He kind of grinned his teeth at me a little bit.
[02:26:58.971 --> 02:27:02.633]  And he actually put his hands on me and actually invited me to the Bahamian Grove, which is kind of weird.
[02:27:02.653 --> 02:27:04.815]  I don't know how I told him, you know, I don't want to be there.
[02:27:04.835 --> 02:27:06.476]  They're shipping male prostitutes in there, man.
[02:27:07.051 --> 02:27:08.653]  I don't know what's wrong with him.
[02:27:08.913 --> 02:27:11.815]  One of the most interesting things is how we got Joe Biden.
[02:27:11.955 --> 02:27:17.120]  Because Joe Biden is a senator who met with the Pakistani ISI before 9-11.
[02:27:17.841 --> 02:27:18.862]  And we asked him a question.
[02:27:19.122 --> 02:27:23.346]  What was he doing with the head of the ISI, General Mohammed Ahmed, before 9-11?
[02:27:24.166 --> 02:27:26.849]  Who was connected with him?
[02:27:26.869 --> 02:27:30.032]  We got another guest coming up, but call the guest, back him on five minutes.
[02:27:31.733 --> 02:27:32.374]  Stay there, Luke.
[02:27:32.494 --> 02:27:33.355]  I've got to hear about this.
[02:27:36.258 --> 02:27:39.300]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.181 --> 02:27:42.923]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.205 --> 02:27:48.927]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[02:27:49.288 --> 02:27:55.792]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription filled.
[02:27:56.133 --> 02:27:57.754]  That's over 46% savings.
[02:27:58.154 --> 02:28:00.436]  The average savings for generic drugs was over 71%.
[02:28:02.297 --> 02:28:10.704]  RxDrugCard.com is the only major discount prescription drug plan that offers a price lookup page, so you can get an idea of your discounted price before you enroll.
[02:28:11.024 --> 02:28:14.306]  RxDrugCard.com is for anyone who pays for their own prescriptions.
[02:28:14.506 --> 02:28:17.088]  There are no age restrictions, all prescriptions are covered, and 95% of
[02:28:18.029 --> 02:28:18.409]  I think so.
[02:28:46.766 --> 02:28:53.568]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two book set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:28:53.948 --> 02:29:00.349]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:29:00.830 --> 02:29:10.712]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:29:11.192 --> 02:29:14.673]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:29:14.973 --> 02:29:17.654]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[02:29:18.274 --> 02:29:20.975]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.

[02:29:45.612 --> 02:29:48.333]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[02:29:48.793 --> 02:29:51.074]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[02:29:51.374 --> 02:29:54.455]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[02:29:54.935 --> 02:29:57.075]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[02:29:57.255 --> 02:29:58.636]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[02:29:58.896 --> 02:30:03.017]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[02:30:03.357 --> 02:30:06.478]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[02:30:06.758 --> 02:30:07.999]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[02:30:09.219 --> 02:30:17.506]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[02:30:17.867 --> 02:30:20.569]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.

[02:30:34.204 --> 02:30:35.106]  That's research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482.
[02:30:35.186 --> 02:30:36.468]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you!
[02:31:03.677 --> 02:31:29.248]  Well, I gotta let him go in a minute, but it's clear I need to have him back up tomorrow live on air for coverage before this thing kicks off.
[02:31:29.835 --> 02:31:42.665]  We're scheduled to have Ron Paul's people on tomorrow in a build-up and then the day after, we of course had Ron Paul on last week, and then the day after the debates we're also going to have Ron Paul as a campaign chairman on.
[02:31:43.986 --> 02:31:44.946]  That's going on.
[02:31:44.986 --> 02:31:46.427]  We had Bilderberg just ended.
[02:31:47.728 --> 02:31:54.874]  We've got Jerusalem Post about the Shin Bet, their intelligence agency involved with Muslim terrorists carrying out attacks.
[02:31:56.555 --> 02:31:59.097]  I've got the UN saying get ready for the dollar to implode.
[02:32:00.434 --> 02:32:16.918]  You've got Luke Rudowsky and his crew of merry men and women, brave fighters, giving King John literal Hades, and now you tell me you confronted Senator Biden.
[02:32:16.958 --> 02:32:18.378]  This just is getting incredible.
[02:32:19.118 --> 02:32:23.959]  And I know that the Hillary video, I can't wait to see that.
[02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:26.060]  But quickly, tell us about the Biden video.
[02:32:26.818 --> 02:32:28.920]  Oh man, I went up to write to Biden and I told him, quote,
[02:32:43.633 --> 02:32:47.894]  And he told me, he met with him, he admitted he met with the head of Pakistani SI, and he told us.
[02:32:48.114 --> 02:32:49.114]  I told him not to do it.
[02:32:49.435 --> 02:32:50.595]  I told him not to wire the money.
[02:32:50.635 --> 02:32:54.516]  I told him to stop supporting the Taliban, which shows he has born of them.
[02:32:54.756 --> 02:32:56.976]  Oh my God.
[02:32:57.056 --> 02:32:57.757]  Oh my God.
[02:32:57.817 --> 02:32:58.637]  This is awesome.
[02:32:59.597 --> 02:33:00.077]  Wait a minute.
[02:33:00.117 --> 02:33:00.997]  Give me word for word.
[02:33:01.017 --> 02:33:02.058]  We're getting a report out on this.
[02:33:02.138 --> 02:33:02.958]  Luke, listen to me.
[02:33:03.838 --> 02:33:04.058]  Yeah.
[02:33:05.359 --> 02:33:06.959]  Don't tell people where you're staying.
[02:33:07.987 --> 02:33:08.607]  Go now.
[02:33:08.688 --> 02:33:11.489]  I know you're going wild doing this interview, that interview.
[02:33:11.769 --> 02:33:18.353]  Go do your Brown interview, but then get copies of that and get it in the mail with the FedEx number.
[02:33:18.373 --> 02:33:19.894]  Do you have our FedEx number on the road?
[02:33:19.914 --> 02:33:24.417]  Yes, I do, but just because... Listen, listen, listen.
[02:33:24.477 --> 02:33:33.382]  Just that Biden clip alone is incredibly bombshell and important because you don't want to have problems tomorrow at the RNC.
[02:33:34.862 --> 02:33:37.543]  Uh, and then, uh, you know, them grabbing your tapes or something.
[02:33:37.583 --> 02:33:53.668]  Not only that, let me just also say this, and he was, and he tried to cover up, he was like, and then he was talking about something else, and then I told him, but sir, he funded the hijackers, you met with him, you did business with him, you let him go, he's free, sir, and he, you know what he told me, he looked me in the wrong face, he said, get a life, kid.
[02:33:54.548 --> 02:34:00.030]  And I just told him, not only was it an inside job, we know what you're doing, and we just, and I just walked away back there, his security guards were kind of pushing me away.
[02:34:00.350 --> 02:34:02.911]  Mega, mega huge, it was Biden,
[02:34:04.034 --> 02:34:11.375]  And it was Graham, and it was... No, no, it was Joe Biden, David Gergen, and Bill Richardson that we confronted.
[02:34:11.535 --> 02:34:12.155]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:34:12.596 --> 02:34:17.016]  I was going back to who met with the Pakistani ISI chief in those five different meetings.
[02:34:17.196 --> 02:34:17.396]  Yeah.
[02:34:17.997 --> 02:34:18.737]  Yeah, they did.
[02:34:18.777 --> 02:34:19.617]  They met right before.
[02:34:20.457 --> 02:34:22.977]  Yeah, this is just absolutely amazing.
[02:34:23.337 --> 02:34:26.298]  Specifically, because we're going to do an article on this even before the video comes out.
[02:34:27.518 --> 02:34:31.919]  Specifically, Luke, tell us what happened with Biden, where you were, how this took place.
[02:34:32.989 --> 02:34:37.351]  This was at the Democratic debate in the spin room, in the CNN spin room.
[02:34:37.371 --> 02:34:40.073]  They were doing a press conference as well, the presidential candidates.
[02:34:40.593 --> 02:34:44.655]  And I went to Senator Joe Biden and I asked him this question, the question I just said before.
[02:34:45.195 --> 02:34:50.497]  And he said specifically, I told him I did not, do not, do not finance the tally ban.
[02:34:50.537 --> 02:34:51.498]  He said that specifically.
[02:34:51.518 --> 02:34:53.259]  That's an exact quote from him.
[02:34:53.359 --> 02:34:54.679]  I said specifically, do not.
[02:34:55.300 --> 02:34:56.900]  He admitted that this was going on.
[02:34:57.141 --> 02:35:00.922]  And if he knew ahead that the ISI was doing this, why were they complicit in it?
[02:35:00.982 --> 02:35:02.323]  Why were they still meeting with him?
[02:35:02.463 --> 02:35:03.404]  That doesn't make any sense.
[02:35:03.744 --> 02:35:07.967]  Well, I mean, they had a meeting with Goss and Graham on the morning of 9-11.
[02:35:08.727 --> 02:35:11.049]  The guy only traveled to the country twice in his life.
[02:35:11.069 --> 02:35:12.230]  It was a clear set-up.
[02:35:13.351 --> 02:35:17.794]  Yeah, it was a total clear set-up, and you know, it's kind of disgusting that these guys were just let free.
[02:35:17.814 --> 02:35:20.936]  They were just allowed to fly back, which shows that they're doing business together.
[02:35:21.016 --> 02:35:23.378]  Well, they also flew out, Ervin Laudens, right after 9-11.
[02:35:23.658 --> 02:35:26.139]  And who else did you guys confront?
[02:35:26.179 --> 02:35:26.720]  Is there more?
[02:35:27.538 --> 02:35:29.799]  It's only Bill Richardson, Joe Biden, David Bergen.
[02:35:29.819 --> 02:35:30.899]  That's only one day here.
[02:35:30.979 --> 02:35:32.660]  Oh, that's all you've got?
[02:35:32.860 --> 02:35:33.600]  Oh, terrible.
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:36.622]  And of course, back in New York, you guys got Hillary.
[02:35:36.642 --> 02:35:39.283]  I mean, listen, I commend you.
[02:35:39.363 --> 02:35:40.143]  I salute you.
[02:35:40.923 --> 02:35:42.944]  Just continue on your operations.
[02:35:43.464 --> 02:35:44.425]  You have done well.
[02:35:45.225 --> 02:35:48.026]  And we just want to commend you, Luke, for the work you're doing.
[02:35:48.832 --> 02:35:49.952]  No, it's not just me here.
[02:35:49.992 --> 02:35:52.073]  It's a whole bunch of Ron Paul supporters.
[02:35:52.393 --> 02:35:54.013]  It's UAlbany that's here also.
[02:35:54.033 --> 02:35:55.653]  It's Students for Scholars for 9-11 Truth.
[02:35:55.873 --> 02:35:57.173]  America Freedom from Fascism.
[02:35:57.413 --> 02:35:58.134]  It's Infowars.
[02:35:58.394 --> 02:36:03.174]  We're all working hard here, here in New Hampshire, here during the Republican and Democratic debates.
[02:36:03.495 --> 02:36:06.735]  Anybody here in the Tricity area, here in New Hampshire, please join us, man.
[02:36:06.975 --> 02:36:09.856]  4 o'clock tomorrow, we're going to be out there showing support for Ron Paul.
[02:36:10.096 --> 02:36:10.656]  Come out there.
[02:36:10.816 --> 02:36:11.996]  We already have 100 people out there.
[02:36:12.156 --> 02:36:13.476]  Let's make it 1,000 people out there.
[02:36:13.636 --> 02:36:14.996]  And let's take over this debate.
[02:36:15.196 --> 02:36:18.057]  Let's make 9-11, let's make Ron Paul the key issues.
[02:36:18.737 --> 02:36:30.180]  Yeah, when they put their video cameras out there, they need to see nothing but 9-11 truth signs, and Infowars.com signs, and WeAreChange.org signs, and American Freedom From Fascism signs.
[02:36:30.500 --> 02:36:32.820]  Listen, Luke, I'm going to call you after the show today.
[02:36:33.100 --> 02:36:34.140]  Continue on, my friend.
[02:36:34.940 --> 02:36:36.061]  Godspeed, Alex.
[02:36:36.461 --> 02:36:36.801]  You bet.
[02:36:36.841 --> 02:36:37.301]  Take care.
[02:36:38.001 --> 02:36:39.321]  Absolutely, this is exciting.
[02:36:39.361 --> 02:36:40.262]  Alright, shifting gears.
[02:36:40.302 --> 02:36:46.763]  I know we have loaded phones, I know I have tons of news, but this is a really important, just a super important subject.
[02:36:47.563 --> 02:36:49.083]  But we're only going to have him on for a few minutes.
[02:36:49.523 --> 02:36:50.564]  We need to support him.
[02:36:51.664 --> 02:36:52.744]  IRS to church?
[02:36:53.324 --> 02:36:53.784]  Shut up!
[02:36:54.885 --> 02:36:55.765]  Church to IRS?
[02:36:55.865 --> 02:36:56.385]  No way!
[02:36:56.485 --> 02:37:00.486]  Pastor under investigation says he will not stop preaching God's Word.
[02:37:00.546 --> 02:37:08.047]  Now, under the First Amendment, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:37:08.107 --> 02:37:08.847]  Go read it and weep.
[02:37:09.708 --> 02:37:14.889]  Instead, they claim that the state's supposed to run religion under separation of church and state.
[02:37:15.149 --> 02:37:16.749]  That there is to be no religious freedom.
[02:37:17.392 --> 02:37:22.098]  And they started with 501c3 tax exemptions 50 years ago saying, oh, just sign this form.
[02:37:22.539 --> 02:37:25.042]  And they say, oh, don't be involved in electioneering.
[02:37:26.524 --> 02:37:30.609]  It was the priests and pastors that led us in 1776 to war against the empire.
[02:37:33.763 --> 02:37:35.364]  But now they're saying it's the opposite.
[02:37:35.684 --> 02:37:38.125]  Well, now they say, don't have anti-abortion signs up.
[02:37:38.485 --> 02:37:41.627]  Don't criticize politicians that are into abortion.
[02:37:42.027 --> 02:37:44.488]  You're not allowed to make comments about campaigns.
[02:37:44.989 --> 02:37:46.790]  You see, folks, this is not America.
[02:37:46.810 --> 02:37:49.371]  This is like Soviet Russia or Communist China.
[02:37:49.791 --> 02:37:55.494]  And joining us is Spirit One Christian Center, Pastor Mark Holick.
[02:37:56.358 --> 02:37:58.400]  And we really appreciate him coming on.
[02:37:58.780 --> 02:38:00.542]  This is a church in Kansas.
[02:38:01.102 --> 02:38:02.504]  And Pastor, thank you for joining us.
[02:38:02.964 --> 02:38:04.005]  Alex, thank you for having me.
[02:38:05.186 --> 02:38:16.876]  Well, here in the land of the free, home of the brave, you better not put up a sign saying the IRS turns Gestapo, seeks to silence free speech and content.
[02:38:16.916 --> 02:38:17.577]  They don't like that.
[02:38:17.597 --> 02:38:22.161]  They don't like abortionist Teller, Kansas' most powerful politician.
[02:38:22.873 --> 02:38:24.955]  They don't like the fact that you're talking about... Don't!
[02:38:25.035 --> 02:38:25.215]  Don't!
[02:38:25.476 --> 02:38:27.478]  Don't talk about a politician who's for abortion!
[02:38:27.738 --> 02:38:29.480]  You can't have your views on abortion now!
[02:38:29.740 --> 02:38:31.582]  This is what America's turned into, Pastor.
[02:38:32.162 --> 02:38:32.383]  Yes.
[02:38:32.623 --> 02:38:33.244]  Yes, it is.
[02:38:35.346 --> 02:38:35.906]  Tell us about it.
[02:38:35.946 --> 02:38:36.567]  Tell us what happened.
[02:38:36.587 --> 02:38:40.511]  Tell us about these creatures, these political commissaria that visited you.
[02:38:41.587 --> 02:38:54.958]  Well, about a month ago we received a letter from the IRS stating that they had reason to believe that we had been involved in political quote-unquote activities.
[02:38:55.739 --> 02:39:00.482]  And they listed some specific activities that we've been involved in.
[02:39:01.263 --> 02:39:04.225]  One of those, like you said, we have a church marquee out front.
[02:39:05.826 --> 02:39:10.150]  For those who are familiar with Kansas, we have a very nationally known
[02:39:10.692 --> 02:39:21.198]  abortionist here named George Tiller kills through all nine months of pregnancy, has his own on-site incinerator where he will burn the babies after they're dead.
[02:39:21.638 --> 02:39:25.241]  Now is he the one that did all the sick stuff that was in the news?
[02:39:26.121 --> 02:39:27.582]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:29.531 --> 02:39:30.591]  No, I mean, tell folks.
[02:39:30.611 --> 02:39:31.532]  That was mainstream news.
[02:39:31.572 --> 02:39:32.952]  I don't like to talk about it.
[02:39:32.992 --> 02:39:35.713]  Nobody wants to hear it, but we need to hear how they treat our little people.
[02:39:36.253 --> 02:39:36.713]  Tell folks.
[02:39:37.073 --> 02:39:38.893]  Yeah, well, it's on-site.
[02:39:39.114 --> 02:39:41.534]  It's his own high-intensity incinerator.
[02:39:42.154 --> 02:39:45.515]  Whatever parts of the baby he can't sell, he will then burn.
[02:39:46.155 --> 02:39:48.616]  He has to put incense in there.
[02:39:48.656 --> 02:39:52.177]  When he burns it, typically he'll do it late at night so nobody sees it.
[02:39:53.557 --> 02:39:57.158]  Not only that, he will bring quote-unquote ministers in
[02:39:57.791 --> 02:40:02.432]  And if the mother wants to baptize the baby after he kills him, they will baptize him.
[02:40:03.012 --> 02:40:04.732]  And so it's a completely blasphemy.
[02:40:04.752 --> 02:40:06.313]  Let me just tell those parents something.
[02:40:06.993 --> 02:40:13.334]  You might not go to hell if you repent for abortion and God will forgive you, but if you pull stuff like that, I don't know if you're going to escape it.
[02:40:13.414 --> 02:40:15.094]  I mean, that is unbelievable blasphemy.
[02:40:15.374 --> 02:40:15.614]  It is.
[02:40:15.655 --> 02:40:16.935]  That is a satanic ritual.
[02:40:17.375 --> 02:40:17.675]  It is.
[02:40:18.415 --> 02:40:22.216]  And then just like you said, Alex, you know, being one of the
[02:40:23.786 --> 02:40:44.985]  There's just not a lot of vocal opposition to it, but we've been very vocal for 16 years in the sanctity of life and the sanctity of marriage, and so because of that, this abortionist will put hundreds, literally hundreds of thousands of dollars into each election cycle, getting the people in that he wants.
[02:40:45.205 --> 02:40:49.029]  It goes all the way up to the governorship of Kathleen Sebelius in Kansas,
[02:40:49.936 --> 02:40:53.519]  And so, um... Oh yeah, I mean, isn't he one of the biggest in the country?
[02:40:53.539 --> 02:40:55.180]  This thing's a modern-day Dachau.
[02:40:55.540 --> 02:40:55.840]  It is.
[02:40:56.120 --> 02:40:56.341]  It is.
[02:40:56.361 --> 02:41:01.404]  He has four abortionists that work out of that clinic.
[02:41:02.184 --> 02:41:04.186]  So it's literally a butcher mill.
[02:41:04.506 --> 02:41:04.766]  It is.
[02:41:04.786 --> 02:41:05.507]  It is.
[02:41:09.378 --> 02:41:10.118]  Unbelievable.
[02:41:10.338 --> 02:41:20.221]  Now, I remember hearing about the guy in Kansas City, because there's so many of these guys, I can't keep track of them all, that was doing weird stuff with the babies, and was blowing all over the walls, and he was supposedly snacking on them.
[02:41:21.562 --> 02:41:22.782]  That's a separate person, right?
[02:41:23.002 --> 02:41:24.203]  That is a separate person, yes.
[02:41:24.743 --> 02:41:26.023]  But you know about that case, right?
[02:41:26.363 --> 02:41:26.603]  I do.
[02:41:27.063 --> 02:41:27.304]  I do.
[02:41:27.764 --> 02:41:30.805]  What is... I mean, of course these guys have got to be sickos, folks.
[02:41:31.865 --> 02:41:35.466]  I mean, nobody could really be an obstetrician and gynecologist and do this.
[02:41:35.526 --> 02:41:38.247]  Ron Paul's not for abortion, because you know those are babies.
[02:41:38.849 --> 02:41:42.590]  That's why they're trying to ban these hologram 3D videos of these babies.
[02:41:44.170 --> 02:41:44.390]  Yeah.
[02:41:44.850 --> 02:41:49.831]  It's just, uh, you know, anything they can do to keep the truth away is what they will do.
[02:41:50.331 --> 02:41:51.972]  Well, I mean, who are the criminals?
[02:41:52.332 --> 02:41:53.512]  Who are the pieces of filth?
[02:41:54.452 --> 02:42:00.853]  We're trying to aid and abet these murderers that are, uh, we're trying to destroy your First Amendment and literally the heart of America.
[02:42:01.113 --> 02:42:01.934]  It's not the second.
[02:42:01.974 --> 02:42:02.594]  It's not the third.
[02:42:02.614 --> 02:42:03.254]  It's not the fourth.
[02:42:03.554 --> 02:42:06.955]  It is the most important and it's, it's our right to stand up and speak out.
[02:42:07.335 --> 02:42:08.555]  Now, what are these people?
[02:42:09.227 --> 02:42:12.671]  Who are they telling you they're coming after your church for political action?
[02:42:13.632 --> 02:42:15.093]  Yeah, for political activity.
[02:42:15.574 --> 02:42:23.242]  It's the Department of the IRS, and they went so far as to ask us, and required us, to answer 31 questions.
[02:42:25.734 --> 02:42:28.056]  By the way, what happened to your Fifth Amendment?
[02:42:28.076 --> 02:42:29.116]  Why do you have to answer the questions?
[02:42:29.457 --> 02:42:31.498]  See, that shows how it's all fake, sir.
[02:42:31.718 --> 02:42:35.081]  They work for a private offshore corporation, but go ahead.
[02:42:35.141 --> 02:42:35.581]  That's right.
[02:42:36.742 --> 02:42:38.703]  But you put it exactly right.
[02:42:40.404 --> 02:42:42.806]  The way you stressed, it's not the second, it's not the third.
[02:42:43.186 --> 02:42:49.851]  Not only that, freedom of religion is even before freedom of speech and freedom of press.
[02:42:51.929 --> 02:42:55.610]  And you're right, the revolution was led by pastors and ministers.
[02:42:55.650 --> 02:42:58.571]  The church has to be the conscience of the state.
[02:42:59.171 --> 02:43:14.416]  And when the state uses its hammer, in this case the IRS, to keep pastors, ministers, churches, Christians from speaking out the truth of the issues of the day, then we have taken away the First Amendment.
[02:43:17.432 --> 02:43:20.895]  Now, have you had these swimmers show up, or are they just sitting in your registered mail?
[02:43:21.195 --> 02:43:22.476]  Yeah, right now it's just mail.
[02:43:23.517 --> 02:43:32.764]  And, uh, we answer... And then, by the way, you answer their questions, and then they collect political data to be used against you in a court of, uh, well, it's not really a court of law, it's one of their fraud courts.
[02:43:33.365 --> 02:43:38.509]  So, see, that's the problem with, oh, we're gonna file charges if you don't fill out whatever questions we ask you.
[02:43:38.829 --> 02:43:44.094]  It's called the Fifth, but then they have these kangaroo courts that aren't even real courts, where they also need a president if you don't answer.
[02:43:44.114 --> 02:43:46.355]  That's probably correct.
[02:43:47.632 --> 02:43:49.053]  Believe me, sir, we're so far gone.
[02:43:49.394 --> 02:43:50.674]  Do you know about the New World Order?
[02:43:51.495 --> 02:43:51.815]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:52.536 --> 02:43:53.837]  Oh, you do know about the New World Order?
[02:43:54.077 --> 02:43:55.318]  I know just a little.
[02:43:55.878 --> 02:43:56.258]  Well, good.
[02:43:56.319 --> 02:43:58.180]  No wonder you sound like you've got a good church.
[02:43:58.980 --> 02:44:01.102]  There's not many of those around here for me to go to.
[02:44:01.662 --> 02:44:03.344]  Where are you located for folks that want to go there?
[02:44:04.184 --> 02:44:08.147]  We're in Wichita, Kansas, 1515 East Harry.
[02:44:11.009 --> 02:44:13.051]  And our website is spirit1cc.org.
[02:44:15.643 --> 02:44:18.404]  Spirit1cc.org.
[02:44:18.424 --> 02:44:27.367]  Well, they're going to claim that you entered into contract with them for a tax-free exemption, but that still doesn't trump your free speech rights.
[02:44:28.087 --> 02:44:33.869]  And, you know, they claim, oh, it's just so you're not running the election booths out of the church and telling people how to vote.
[02:44:34.310 --> 02:44:35.910]  Of course, that violates the First Amendment, too.
[02:44:36.270 --> 02:44:43.773]  But to point out that this guy is politically active, lobbying to continue murder, that is your free speech right, even within their system.
[02:44:44.646 --> 02:44:45.086]  Exactly.
[02:44:45.567 --> 02:44:57.735]  And not only that, a point I'd like to make is that, you know, our form of government, three branches of government, our founding fathers got that from the Bible.
[02:44:58.535 --> 02:45:02.538]  Isaiah 33, 22, God is our judge, God is our lawgiver, God is our king.
[02:45:03.498 --> 02:45:07.881]  The fact that we have a separation of the branches of government
[02:45:08.314 --> 02:45:08.935]  We're good to go.
[02:45:31.463 --> 02:45:37.189]  And, uh, you know, that guy can go on for a long time that's doing what he's doing, but he's not going to be able to run on forever.
[02:45:37.530 --> 02:45:38.951]  And he's got God to deal with.
[02:45:39.472 --> 02:45:42.175]  And I mean, those IRS people engage in this type of wickedness.
[02:45:43.208 --> 02:45:47.852]  They probably wonder why they've got such horrible, unblessed lives, and it's because they're wicked filth.
[02:45:48.372 --> 02:45:51.015]  And we're going to be praying for you, Pastor, and we appreciate you coming on.
[02:45:51.035 --> 02:45:52.276]  Thank you, Alex, for having me.
[02:45:52.536 --> 02:45:53.697]  God bless you, and you take care.
[02:45:54.017 --> 02:46:01.703]  And even if you're not a Christian and all the rest of it, you're so delusional, folks, those of you that are still for abortion, it's because a lot of you have been involved in it.
[02:46:02.424 --> 02:46:05.626]  Listen, you were lied to, you were told it wasn't a human, you were young.
[02:46:06.207 --> 02:46:07.167]  It's all eugenics.
[02:46:07.407 --> 02:46:08.488]  Eugenics is what started the CPS.
[02:46:09.958 --> 02:46:20.262]  It's what started all these evil things, the testing drugs on people, the Feds announced last week no law, they just said we're going to test on you without authorization, without compliance, without you being told.
[02:46:20.703 --> 02:46:23.184]  That was the cover of major newspapers nationwide.
[02:46:24.744 --> 02:46:25.785]  See, everything's changing.
[02:46:26.445 --> 02:46:28.126]  You can lie to yourself all day long.
[02:46:28.966 --> 02:46:33.768]  By the way, it's not called abortion if the baby is dying or dead or it's going to hurt the mother.
[02:46:33.808 --> 02:46:36.029]  It's called a medical procedure to save the mother's life.
[02:46:36.832 --> 02:46:41.275]  So those arguments, and Ron Paul would tell you that, these arguments about, what if the mother's dying?
[02:46:41.716 --> 02:46:43.617]  That isn't how it works, okay?
[02:46:43.977 --> 02:46:48.761]  If the mother's dying, they have to go in and they try to save the baby, but if it dies, that's the way it is.
[02:46:50.342 --> 02:46:52.803]  So see, there's a lot of also misrepresentations here.
[02:46:55.525 --> 02:46:57.066]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:46:58.795 --> 02:47:08.659]  Look, if we don't take care of these little people, we were all in that position once, if we don't take care of the most gentle and small and tender and defenseless, we were all in there once.
[02:47:09.780 --> 02:47:20.324]  If we don't do that, and we become the ultimate cheeseburger, instant gratification society, and use abortion as birth control, folks, if we do that to them, we're doomed.
[02:47:20.544 --> 02:47:22.745]  Because, let me tell you, that's how the universe works.
[02:47:23.245 --> 02:47:27.707]  You do great evil, you carry out great evil, and you will pay for it.
[02:47:28.553 --> 02:47:29.473]  So repent now.
[02:47:29.493 --> 02:47:32.034]  I want to tell you about a great sponsor.
[02:47:32.074 --> 02:47:33.175]  It's Researched Herbs.

[02:47:49.981 --> 02:47:50.041]  1-800-845-3841.
[02:47:56.483 --> 02:47:58.664]  One of their best selling products is LIV52.
[02:47:58.885 --> 02:48:02.387]  It is one of the world's best selling liver support formulas.

[02:48:13.794 --> 02:48:15.315]  One of the well documented ones out there.
[02:48:15.335 --> 02:48:17.796]  That's why it's ResearchHerbs.com or 1-800-845-3841.
[02:48:22.637 --> 02:48:24.019]  ResearchCurves.com.
[02:48:24.059 --> 02:48:24.960]  I just want you to know this.
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:26.061]  You can always repent.
[02:48:26.762 --> 02:48:28.684]  You can always turn back from evil, folks.
[02:48:28.704 --> 02:48:34.711]  You can always become weak and soften your heart, and then you'll find a strength you never knew.
[02:48:34.731 --> 02:48:43.321]  You can always hit your knees and ask God to take the weight of evil from your soul.
[02:48:49.352 --> 02:48:54.837]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:55.197 --> 02:49:02.824]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.539 --> 02:49:10.581]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.981 --> 02:49:22.405]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.705 --> 02:49:26.646]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.666 --> 02:49:28.607]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.947 --> 02:49:32.788]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:01.179 --> 02:51:06.082]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:06.282 --> 02:51:15.246]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[02:51:50.665 --> 02:51:55.488]  We just ended up having Luke for that breaking news and the pastor on and things that were really important.
[02:51:55.508 --> 02:51:57.409]  But I'm going to have a day of this week where it's nothing but calls.
[02:51:57.909 --> 02:52:00.330]  We did take quite a few in the first and second hour though.
[02:52:01.971 --> 02:52:05.973]  Before I hit some final news stories, InnerFood is just a great product.
[02:52:06.413 --> 02:52:13.377]  It's the best green food I found out there with 30 plus extracts of different vegetables and fruits.
[02:52:14.629 --> 02:52:21.076]  Uh, it really lowers your appetite too because you eat and eat and eat because the regular foods you're eating have been debaked.
[02:52:21.096 --> 02:52:22.938]  They don't have the nutrients in them.
[02:52:23.478 --> 02:52:25.661]  And I mix it with orange juice or apple juice.
[02:52:25.721 --> 02:52:26.742]  My wife uses it.
[02:52:27.422 --> 02:52:28.684]  And it's just fabulous stuff.
[02:52:28.724 --> 02:52:30.185]  I kept hearing everybody rant and ramble about it.
[02:52:30.305 --> 02:52:31.387]  And it's owned by Patriots.
[02:52:31.407 --> 02:52:37.613]  I didn't know they were, the owner's friends with George Humphreys and many other people here locally in Austin.
[02:52:38.897 --> 02:52:42.299]  The owner's from Austin, but it's a nutritionist, but they're based out in Colorado now.
[02:52:42.679 --> 02:52:44.840]  Innerfood.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:50.863]  The FDA and Big Pharma are conspiring to deprive you of the nutrition, energy, and good health that you're entitled to.
[02:52:51.843 --> 02:52:56.045]  And they literally, folks, do want you unhealthy, so then you go into their whole medical system.
[02:52:56.465 --> 02:53:04.589]  So go to Innerfood.com, E-N-E-R, food.com, and check out all the great products they've got, including their main line food, Innerfood, their main product.
[02:53:04.609 --> 02:53:05.750]  They've got a lot of other stuff.

[02:53:19.896 --> 02:53:21.817]  And it's almost sold out, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:21.837 --> 02:53:24.558]  We're almost out of the original first edition Terror Storm.
[02:53:25.458 --> 02:53:28.299]  The final cut is coming out in the middle of next month.
[02:53:28.919 --> 02:53:33.461]  So we're going to be out of Terror Storm for a while before we can even offer the new one.
[02:53:34.190 --> 02:53:34.691]  We're good to go.
[02:53:53.943 --> 02:53:54.683]  Excellent film.
[02:53:54.803 --> 02:53:58.665]  I'm sending a signed card with each one until they're gone.
[02:53:58.725 --> 02:54:05.007]  Write to us at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 787-04 to get them.
[02:54:05.768 --> 02:54:12.891]  We call toll free 888-253-3139 or see them all online at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:54:17.993 --> 02:54:21.154]  All available at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:25.140 --> 02:54:29.721]  I am almost out of time here today, and I did mention these.
[02:54:29.761 --> 02:54:35.463]  I did spend a little bit of time on these, but Paul Watson and Steve Watson, I know are doing articles on these right now.
[02:54:36.103 --> 02:54:40.504]  That'll be up this afternoon on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, but it's so important.
[02:54:40.845 --> 02:54:41.765]  Let's get out to everybody.
[02:54:42.105 --> 02:54:47.206]  GOP head saying we need more attacks on American soil, so people quote appreciate Bush.
[02:54:47.746 --> 02:54:52.988]  He gave this interview to a major newspaper in Arkansas.
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:57.341]  Also, headline, Shin Bet involved in 1976 hijackings.
[02:54:58.081 --> 02:55:06.883]  They teamed up with a quote, new, out-of-the-blue Muslim extremist group to demonize Arabs and to kill a peace process.
[02:55:08.423 --> 02:55:11.384]  It says here that Israel didn't want to legitimize the peace process.
[02:55:12.764 --> 02:55:14.904]  Now, I don't know if this is true.
[02:55:14.944 --> 02:55:15.984]  Israel's saying it is.
[02:55:17.005 --> 02:55:17.945]  Israel is, not me.
[02:55:19.425 --> 02:55:23.466]  I'd always heard from good sources and read a few tidbits that they staged this with the Idi Amin.
[02:55:24.614 --> 02:55:26.055]  Who they were, by the way, buddies with.
[02:55:26.095 --> 02:55:29.176]  You know Idi Amin had Mossad as his advisors.
[02:55:29.596 --> 02:55:31.517]  Mossad ran security for Idi Amin.
[02:55:32.397 --> 02:55:33.477]  See, people don't know this.
[02:55:34.278 --> 02:55:35.838]  Frankly, I knew they ran it, okay?
[02:55:36.018 --> 02:55:39.059]  Everybody who knows this stuff knows it, but I wouldn't say it because I couldn't prove it.
[02:55:39.379 --> 02:55:40.500]  Here they are, folks.
[02:55:41.920 --> 02:55:42.661]  This is big.
[02:55:43.161 --> 02:55:46.342]  And most of those Al-Qaeda attacks in Israel are Shin Bet.
[02:55:47.903 --> 02:55:50.604]  And they send in Israeli commandos to be killed by them, not even knowing.
[02:55:50.624 --> 02:55:54.325]  A lot of times the low-level Muslims who work for Shin Bet don't even know it.
[02:55:56.053 --> 02:55:58.174]  And the JFK airport plot, same deal.
[02:55:58.315 --> 02:55:59.375]  Huge reports on that.
[02:55:59.816 --> 02:56:02.597]  Get them, get them out to everybody or they're going to keep playing these tricks on us.
[02:56:02.978 --> 02:56:04.439]  Well, the public's starting to wake up.
[02:56:06.320 --> 02:56:07.801]  It's just, everything's accelerating.
[02:56:08.121 --> 02:56:11.663]  More wall-to-wall coverage of all of it.
[02:56:12.184 --> 02:56:15.026]  Just watch InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:15.066 --> 02:56:15.706]  They're the sites.

[02:56:16.627 --> 02:56:20.209]  And to all of you, I really appreciate everything you've done.
[02:56:21.130 --> 02:56:23.051]  Just get out there and take on the New World Order.
