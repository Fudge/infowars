[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:03.871]  There is no excuse, like no other, like no other.
[00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:06.633]  Strap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:09.394]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:09.394 --> 00:00:12.616]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:15.078]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:18.380]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.642]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:23.843]  Now live from Austin, Texas.
[00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:35.612]  He is Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.612 --> 00:00:37.493]  Now into the second hour.
[00:00:37.493 --> 00:00:43.516]  I'm here every Sunday evening or afternoon, depending on which time zone you're listening to us in, here in the North American Union.
[00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:49.739]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-590-5525 or locally in Central Texas.
[00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.402]  Well, I guess just this affiliate, KLVJ, goes all the way from Oklahoma and down into Mexico in some areas.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.781]  That's 836-0590.
[00:00:55.781 --> 00:01:03.107]  But we're going to get to your calls, those of you that are holding from New York and Wisconsin and North Dakota.
[00:01:03.107 --> 00:01:08.211]  But that'll be in the last 30 minutes of the show, interspersed with the key news I mentioned in the first hour.
[00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:14.697]  Orlando Sentinel neo-Nazi rally was organized by the FBI through an informant.
[00:01:14.697 --> 00:01:18.921]  Oh yes, why is the government staging Nazi rallies all over the country?
[00:01:19.562 --> 00:01:22.103]  That's to terrorize the public and we'll break that down for you.
[00:01:22.103 --> 00:01:28.545]  Also some new medical developments, some really scary stuff, and some good news as well.
[00:01:28.545 --> 00:01:32.867]  And I will spend some time getting into credit cards aimed at illegal immigrants.
[00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:35.088]  No ID needed to get them.
[00:01:35.088 --> 00:01:39.129]  And it just so happens I have an employee who has a Bank of America bank account.
[00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:43.776]  And they won't even let him do basic banking without two forms of ID.
[00:01:43.776 --> 00:01:46.397]  So you can have bank accounts with him, it doesn't matter.
[00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:50.658]  But if you're an illegal alien, man, you're like God.
[00:01:50.658 --> 00:01:53.519]  That's all part of the North American Union as well.
[00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:55.519]  We'll break that down.
[00:01:55.519 --> 00:02:00.901]  Now, I've been attacked by popular mechanics, good old yellow journalism, Hearst Publishing.
[00:02:01.724 --> 00:02:10.528]  I've been attacked by the Washington Post and Vanity Fair and literally hundreds of magazines and newspapers and dozens of national and international TV shows and I get a little bit used to it.
[00:02:10.528 --> 00:02:24.035]  But the BBC came here, I don't know, back in August and for a week followed me around in my office, my home, my car, here at the studios here in North Austin where I do the Sunday radio show.
[00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:25.035]  I just started the show.
[00:02:25.035 --> 00:02:28.537]  We were developing it for syndication then for a few months before it kicked off four months ago.
[00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:39.868]  And rarely at the end of an interview, especially when I've spent off and on a week with people, would they just tell me that they don't believe a word I've said and laugh at me.
[00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:49.254]  But Guy Smith, the director of the program, a big mainline BBC production that aired tonight, it ended about an hour and eight minutes ago,
[00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:58.084]  I haven't had a chance to see it yet, but we saw the synopsis and four or five articles the BBC put out promoing it and several clips, and it was clear it was a hit piece.
[00:02:58.084 --> 00:03:00.628]  They admitted it was a hit piece, basically.
[00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.252]  Well, at the same time, denying it.
[00:03:03.252 --> 00:03:06.675]  Like, oh yeah, they're a bunch of crazy kooks, but at the same time, this is a balanced piece.
[00:03:06.675 --> 00:03:22.050]  Well, Paul Watson, who's a reporter for PrisonPlanet.com and the editor over there as well, joins us from the UK, and he had a chance to see it tonight and to write up some notes, and so this is delving into how they run these hit pieces, how they operate,
[00:03:22.907 --> 00:03:24.029]  Good to be here, Alex.
[00:03:40.946 --> 00:03:45.768]  Paul, you had a chance to see it there with your girlfriend this evening.
[00:03:45.768 --> 00:03:47.728]  Tell me what the notes you have.
[00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:50.349]  I know a big article is coming out tomorrow on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.750]  You're going to analyze it.
[00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.831]  You wrote several articles previously this week.
[00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:57.371]  One that got picked up on the main page of Digg.com.
[00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:00.712]  Hundreds of times bigger than the drugs report.
[00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:03.313]  And so we got millions of readers just off of that report.
[00:04:03.313 --> 00:04:05.634]  What are you going to be writing about tomorrow?
[00:04:07.097 --> 00:04:17.149]  Well, I predicted in those articles at the end of the week, Alex, that this would be a highly sophisticated hit piece.
[00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:23.637]  Well, you can subtract the words highly sophisticated and then you'll have an accurate reflection of what it was.
[00:04:24.372 --> 00:04:29.935]  It was a hit piece, but it was blatantly obvious that it was designed to be that all along.
[00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:31.836]  For the lowest common denominator.
[00:04:31.836 --> 00:04:32.396]  Exactly.
[00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:37.299]  And you said that the BBC followed you around for a week, basically.
[00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:44.403]  And at the end of it, just started laughing at me, and I literally felt like I was sitting there with operatives or something at the restaurant.
[00:04:44.403 --> 00:04:45.123]  We ate at P.F.
[00:04:45.123 --> 00:04:48.085]  Chang's after the Sunday show, and they were just all laughing at me.
[00:04:50.158 --> 00:04:52.279]  They were like, ah, the government didn't kill Diana.
[00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:54.299]  And I go, well, 87% of Brits believe it.
[00:04:54.299 --> 00:04:57.641]  And she said Charles told her he was going to kill her in a fake auto accident.
[00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:00.022]  And Dr. David Kelly said that the government was going to kill him.
[00:05:00.022 --> 00:05:01.282]  They laughed at me about that.
[00:05:01.282 --> 00:05:03.883]  And they wouldn't let me put Operation Northwoods in there.
[00:05:03.883 --> 00:05:07.605]  None of the actual US government plans to carry out 9-11 style attacks.
[00:05:07.605 --> 00:05:10.626]  They all wanted to just discuss straw men.
[00:05:10.626 --> 00:05:12.287]  But Paul, you're here.
[00:05:12.287 --> 00:05:12.827]  You've seen it.
[00:05:12.827 --> 00:05:14.328]  Tell us about it.
[00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:15.408]  Right.
[00:05:15.408 --> 00:05:17.089]  Just on the sheer numbers alone.
[00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:29.306]  They had three individuals representing the 9-11 truth movement being Alex Jones, yourself, Jim Fetzer and Dylan Avery.
[00:05:29.306 --> 00:05:39.172]  They had 11 individuals either representing the official story or the incompetence whitewash.
[00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:46.516]  So just by the very numbers they had more than three times the amount of debunkers versus so-called 9-11 truthers.
[00:05:48.217 --> 00:05:55.041]  And the method they used was... Well that would, you said fourteen to three, that would be five... Eleven, eleven to three.
[00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:58.223]  Oh, eleven, okay, so that would be almost four times.
[00:05:58.223 --> 00:05:59.984]  Almost four times.
[00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:10.950]  The tactic they used was they would let the debunkers talk at length about their issues and the 9-11 truthers were highly edited.
[00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.072]  I mean, you alone to say that they spent a week with you
[00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:19.952]  The total amount of time that you were on the show, I guess, would equate to about three minutes.
[00:06:19.952 --> 00:06:22.633]  And you had little segments alone.
[00:06:22.633 --> 00:06:25.415]  They also promised to mention PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:06:25.415 --> 00:06:37.161]  I mean, I gave them free films, had stuff dubbed at great expense, spent just four or five hours a day, sometimes eight, nine hours a day, catering to these people, and you say I'm in the film three minutes.
[00:06:38.388 --> 00:06:40.268]  Yeah, it's short segments of you.
[00:06:40.268 --> 00:06:42.189]  There's no mention of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:46.970]  In fact, on the BBC's own website, for the promo material, they linked to InfoWars.
[00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.151]  They got the wrong link, so it was a dead link and they failed to correct it.
[00:06:51.151 --> 00:06:53.132]  Yeah, I'm sure that was an accident.
[00:06:53.132 --> 00:07:02.334]  But they say every great work of fiction has to have a strong beginning, middle and end, and that's exactly what the BBC produced in this work of fiction.
[00:07:03.095 --> 00:07:13.497]  Because at the start of the program, the debate was framed so as to make it appear that 9-11 truth, and even asking any questions about it, was an insult to the victims.
[00:07:13.497 --> 00:07:18.938]  And they keep saying that we're emotional, and that it's a religion, and that we're not going off facts.
[00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:21.158]  The major... Okay.
[00:07:21.158 --> 00:07:27.440]  The head, and you need to put this in the article, and I've interviewed him, the head of the biggest 9-11 families group,
[00:07:29.924 --> 00:07:35.770]  Now believes it's an inside job and said the majority of the victims' families believe it's a total inside job.
[00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.711]  Be sure and add that.
[00:07:37.711 --> 00:07:40.334]  They have had huge demonstrations at the White House.
[00:07:40.334 --> 00:07:45.979]  The majority of the firefighters we talked to in New York, we have them on video, believe it's an inside job.
[00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:51.164]  We have 84% of Americans in major polls believing they're being lied to about 9-11.
[00:07:51.164 --> 00:07:55.388]  But I did predict they would claim that we were insulting and making the families mad.
[00:07:56.508 --> 00:08:04.091]  And of course they had some guy from the X-Files on there explaining how it's a religion we have, that we're a bunch of kooks, but go ahead, Paul.
[00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:04.571]  Right.
[00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:14.695]  I mean, the very start of the show was a narrative of the official version of events, and as I predicted, it was this sneering, sardonic female narrative.
[00:08:15.747 --> 00:08:32.112]  And then they showed images of the event while narrating the official story, along with the grief-stricken faces of the victims, therefore marrying the two, the official version of events and the poor helpless victims in the mind of the casual viewer.
[00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:42.656]  And as he mentioned, failed to include the fact that the majority of family groups are now the ones asking the questions, and that it was a government cover-up in the very hours after 9-11
[00:08:43.968 --> 00:08:59.993]  That has now resulted in 20% of the heroes, the first responders, dying as a result of that cover-up, which told them that... And now it's admitted they have the EPA documents where they say they were ordered to cover it up and not give them medical treatment.
[00:08:59.993 --> 00:09:00.793]  Right.
[00:09:00.793 --> 00:09:03.954]  And that's 20% of the first responders that are now dying.
[00:09:03.954 --> 00:09:07.855]  And by the way, all of the police dogs are now dead from nasal and lung cancer.
[00:09:08.917 --> 00:09:16.903]  Right, and we know for a fact that they talked to first responders who were there at the scene, like Craig Bartman.
[00:09:16.903 --> 00:09:19.805]  That's right, who I've interviewed for video.
[00:09:19.805 --> 00:09:21.406]  Well, let's talk about that.
[00:09:21.406 --> 00:09:22.567]  Exactly.
[00:09:22.567 --> 00:09:23.187]  Oh, man.
[00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:27.190]  I mean, folks, there's so many... We're analyzing a hit piece.
[00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.852]  We're analyzing propaganda here.
[00:09:30.852 --> 00:09:33.414]  And so basically, it was an emotional piece.
[00:09:33.414 --> 00:09:34.675]  They just went after emotion, Paul.
[00:09:36.952 --> 00:09:41.175]  We'll find out on the other side from Paul Watson of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:41.175 --> 00:09:42.375]  Find out the truth, folks.
[00:09:42.375 --> 00:09:44.337]  See TerrorStorm for yourself.
[00:09:44.337 --> 00:09:46.318]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break.
[00:09:46.318 --> 00:09:48.039]  Stay with us.
[00:10:13.524 --> 00:10:14.788]  Rush Limbaugh.
[00:10:14.788 --> 00:10:16.153]  New rules.
[00:10:16.153 --> 00:10:18.962]  Make firms track emails and instant messages.
[00:10:19.682 --> 00:10:37.249]  As you're composing your emails and your chats, and you're going back and forth with friends, even if it has nothing to do with business, just make sure that you never write anything that you wouldn't want read back to you while you sit on the stand in court in front of a jury.
[00:10:37.249 --> 00:10:39.130]  This is unbelievable.
[00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.691]  Rush is live weekdays from 11 to 2 on News Radio 590 KLVJ.
[00:10:49.418 --> 00:10:52.381]  A blue whale's tongue weighs more than an elephant.
[00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:53.122]  Amazing.
[00:10:53.122 --> 00:10:57.287]  During World War II, Americans tried to train bats to drop bombs.
[00:10:57.287 --> 00:10:58.148]  Incredible.
[00:10:58.148 --> 00:11:00.911]  And every second, every minute, every hour.
[00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:03.313]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:11:03.313 --> 00:11:03.674]  You're up!
[00:11:04.472 --> 00:11:13.886]  News Radio 590 KLBJ takes the big stories from over 6 billion people in 193 countries and delivers it to you every 30 minutes.
[00:11:13.886 --> 00:11:15.448]  All amazing and true.
[00:11:15.448 --> 00:11:15.849]  News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[00:11:15.849 --> 00:11:16.570]  Austin's 24-hour news station.
[00:11:22.643 --> 00:11:28.106]  I'm sick of people talking about how the video games affect the kids.
[00:11:28.106 --> 00:11:30.447]  Video games for a lot of guys are entertainment.
[00:11:30.447 --> 00:11:31.688]  I don't call it entertainment.
[00:11:31.688 --> 00:11:37.911]  They show these to adults that are in the military so that they'll have no compunction about pulling the switch.
[00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:42.234]  Making the comment about training the guys to pull the trigger easier is completely inaccurate.
[00:11:42.234 --> 00:11:46.396]  It affects the kids, it affects the adults, and people are just lying to themselves.
[00:11:46.396 --> 00:11:49.818]  Get your morning fix with Mark, Ed, and Sergeant Sam.
[00:11:49.818 --> 00:11:51.058]  Weekday mornings from 5.30 to 10.
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.321]  How quickly we forget.
[00:11:56.321 --> 00:12:02.143]  Price of gasoline drops, the sale of hybrid cars collapses.
[00:12:02.143 --> 00:12:03.684]  It's amazing.
[00:12:03.684 --> 00:12:15.428]  Hybrid cars have dropped, the sales of them, according to Edmunds.com, have dropped by a third since gas prices fell from their peak of over three dollars a gallon.
[00:12:15.428 --> 00:12:21.751]  So, we have short memories, and people who wanted hybrid cars during the run-up in gasoline
[00:12:22.463 --> 00:12:27.167]  Found the prices of them being sold way, way, way above list.
[00:12:27.167 --> 00:12:37.657]  Now that's over, but now I'm looking at supply figures from the industry, and you've got a good shot moving forward that you're going to be able to deal on a hybrid.
[00:12:37.657 --> 00:12:38.718]  That's right!
[00:12:38.718 --> 00:12:44.743]  So the dealer telling you what you're going to pay, you're going to be able to negotiate for a hybrid like any other vehicle.
[00:12:44.743 --> 00:12:46.245]  But even with that having been said,
[00:12:46.969 --> 00:12:53.479]  Gotta run the numbers comparing the hybrid to a regular gas engine car to see if you'll ever make up that extra cost that you pay up front.
[00:12:53.479 --> 00:12:56.604]  I have fantastic news for you on the car front.
[00:12:56.604 --> 00:13:01.993]  This is Clark Howard with fantastic money-saving deals on Chrysler products.
[00:13:02.887 --> 00:13:14.851]  Chrysler is having so much trouble unloading cars that are sitting on dealer lots and in parking lots owned by Chrysler that they're offering double incentives right now, according to the Detroit News.
[00:13:14.851 --> 00:13:24.394]  Dealers right now are getting under-the-table money from Chrysler, known as dealer incentives, of up to $7,000 per model.
[00:13:24.394 --> 00:13:27.254]  That's about the most extreme I've ever heard.
[00:13:27.254 --> 00:13:31.916]  And consumers are receiving targeted mailings for coupons
[00:13:32.884 --> 00:13:34.926]  For up to $1,000!
[00:13:34.926 --> 00:13:40.391]  Actually, they are worth $1,000 if you buy a Chrysler product.
[00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:50.019]  These coupons will pretty soon show up on trading sites like Craigslist and eBay, so if you want a coupon and you didn't get one, you should be able to find one pretty easily.
[00:13:50.712 --> 00:13:54.615]  And they need you, so you can deal even beyond the vouchers.
[00:13:54.615 --> 00:13:56.056]  Hi, it's Dr. Dina Dell.
[00:13:56.056 --> 00:13:57.718]  Alright, you got a kid in high school.
[00:13:57.718 --> 00:14:06.165]  If I were to ask you what you think your child has done, sexually, versus what your kid would say they really have done, you think it'd be the same?
[00:14:06.165 --> 00:14:11.389]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:12.530]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:14:17.822 --> 00:14:18.763]  All right, welcome back.
[00:14:18.763 --> 00:14:29.511]  Your calls and a ton of really important news on other subjects coming up after the break, but about eight, nine months ago, they had the Scripps Howard Ohio poll.
[00:14:29.511 --> 00:14:32.413]  36% believe 9-11 is a total inside job.
[00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:35.956]  66% of that poll believe they're being lied to.
[00:14:35.956 --> 00:14:39.299]  And a few months after that, now just about five months ago,
[00:14:39.997 --> 00:14:40.678]  We're good to go.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:10.243]  Constantly interrogating me, trying to get me to screw up, trying to get me to talk about straw men or issues of 9-11 that weren't true, because there are a lot of kooks out there putting out this info.
[00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:20.665]  And so I guess for a week, because they didn't plan to be here but for a day or two, but they just kept coming back and doing more and getting more and more frustrated and then pretty much on purpose saying, oh, we just need 30 more minutes.
[00:15:20.665 --> 00:15:22.366]  My wife's waiting for me to eat dinner.
[00:15:22.366 --> 00:15:24.807]  They take almost two hours.
[00:15:24.807 --> 00:15:28.227]  And I guess they didn't get what they wanted, Paul, because you say I wasn't in there very much.
[00:15:28.227 --> 00:15:28.768]  Let me guess.
[00:15:28.768 --> 00:15:29.908]  Fetzer was in there a whole bunch.
[00:15:31.747 --> 00:15:34.768]  That's correct, Fetzer, especially your prominence book.
[00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:35.929]  I am.
[00:15:35.929 --> 00:15:50.814]  The tactic they used was they played the statements of the debunkers at length and gave them a chance to talk, whereas your statements and Avery's statements were highly, tightly edited and briefed.
[00:15:50.814 --> 00:15:58.617]  I mean, they had one shot, which was just of the interviewer asking Dylan Avery a question and it shows Avery, you know, shifting his eyes.
[00:15:59.501 --> 00:16:02.464]  A blatant attempt to discredit him.
[00:16:02.464 --> 00:16:04.246]  And, you know, this was not repeated.
[00:16:04.246 --> 00:16:06.488]  Yeah, they spent days with him too.
[00:16:06.488 --> 00:16:06.948]  Exactly.
[00:16:06.948 --> 00:16:15.136]  Imagine me for a week, having to keep my eyes straight, never picking my nose, never wiping my face, always when they have the camera on, having to be totally on.
[00:16:15.136 --> 00:16:17.419]  Did they catch me in anything stupid?
[00:16:17.419 --> 00:16:19.341]  Because they were sneaking around the entire time.
[00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:21.663]  Did they catch me acting buffoonish?
[00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:40.620]  No, but what they did was they would refer to the debunkers as either heroes or sober professionals, but they referred to Dylan Avery as a quote, self-confessed dropout, and they referred to you as an internet evangelist.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:46.543]  So they threw in those negative connotations immediately in the description of who they were interviewing.
[00:16:49.494 --> 00:17:04.367]  Another tactic they used, as I mentioned, they would let the debunkers talk at length, and then the sneering female narrator would lend them credibility by announcing the supporting evidence and referring to documents and so forth.
[00:17:04.367 --> 00:17:10.692]  Let me guess, they used NIST to support why the towers fell, Building 7 not hit by a jet aircraft, did they mention?
[00:17:10.692 --> 00:17:18.679]  And at the time I gave them the documents on this, that NIST has removed the five reasons they claim the towers collapsed, and are saying they're now having to look at explosives.
[00:17:19.992 --> 00:17:22.435]  They did not mention that they were looking at explosives.
[00:17:22.435 --> 00:17:37.550]  All they said was it's subject to an upcoming report, which is most likely going to back up the official version of events, which they first... But almost six years on, right now they're saying, okay, buildings have never fallen like this, there may be bombs.
[00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.792]  But I guess when I gave them that in this report, they didn't care.
[00:17:40.811 --> 00:17:47.056]  No, and the focus on Building 7 was so pathetic it barely amounted to a minute.
[00:17:47.056 --> 00:17:56.224]  They focused their core attack around three issues, which were that a C-130 plane coordinated the attack on the Pentagon.
[00:17:57.472 --> 00:18:04.577]  The supposition that there was no plane in Pennsylvania and the Jewish conspiracy angle.
[00:18:04.577 --> 00:18:05.517]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:18:05.517 --> 00:18:10.220]  Neither I, Avery or Fetzer think it's an Israeli attack.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:15.063]  In fact, they've had national polls of people that believe it's an inside job.
[00:18:15.063 --> 00:18:17.284]  7% believe Israel was involved.
[00:18:17.284 --> 00:18:19.505]  They kept trying to get me to talk about that.
[00:18:19.505 --> 00:18:20.146]  I said no.
[00:18:20.146 --> 00:18:21.927]  The military-industrial complex
[00:18:22.407 --> 00:18:24.649]  Yeah, that was one of the three centerpieces of it.
[00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:55.210]  This victim, this Jewish victim, photographs of his family, his baby, they regaled us with tales of how he saved other people in the building thinking... Did they imply that I said that they weren't in the building?
[00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:01.653]  No, not to you personally, that was mainly... It was all guilt by association, you know, that's how they operate.
[00:19:01.653 --> 00:19:16.243]  Well, I mean, that whole story started because Haraj, Jerusalem Post, and Newsweek reported the fact that Otago Instant Message Company, based in Tel Aviv, warned their New York offices two hours before to get their employees out of the building, and the director of Otago's on record.
[00:19:16.243 --> 00:19:19.825]  But a lot of people got warnings.
[00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.427]  In fact, other companies got warnings.
[00:19:21.427 --> 00:19:26.330]  That's why, at that time of day, that building was only at half the occupancy it normally was.
[00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:33.114]  Right, but they said that Hezbollah was the source of that, so they then linked us in with Hezbollah and terrorists.
[00:19:33.114 --> 00:19:41.078]  What they did with the collapses, they actually showed the Nova animation, which shows the so-called pancake collapse.
[00:19:41.078 --> 00:19:43.320]  Which says there were no central columns in Tower 1 or 2.
[00:19:44.210 --> 00:20:01.466]  Right, and the animation shows the floors collapsing at a rate of about 2 or 3 a second, when we know that each tower collapsed in just over 10 seconds, meaning that 11 floors a second would have needed to collapse without resistance, and that was never mentioned.
[00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:05.810]  Now let's be clear, they fell at three fall speed impossible?
[00:20:06.696 --> 00:20:12.239]  By the way, underwriting laboratories who underwrote the buildings in a study and concluded it was impossible.
[00:20:12.239 --> 00:20:16.542]  And then when the director of one of their projects went public, Kevin Ryan, they fired him.
[00:20:16.542 --> 00:20:18.103]  Okay?
[00:20:18.103 --> 00:20:24.787]  Whenever you see UL on a building, or UL on a fire extinguisher, or a life vest, they certify everything in the western world, folks.
[00:20:24.787 --> 00:20:28.629]  They said it's impossible, and then were told for national security reasons not to report it.
[00:20:30.037 --> 00:20:42.820]  Yeah, they were showing this Nova animation, which has been debunked time and time again because it shows two floors collapsing every second, which would have meant that the entirety of the building would have taken... 50 seconds.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.501]  50, 60 seconds to collapse, which is obviously not the case.
[00:20:46.501 --> 00:20:50.141]  Now, one collapsed in 10, one in, what, about 11?
[00:20:50.141 --> 00:20:51.042]  Right.
[00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:57.683]  Another tactic they used was they lent the debunkers more credibility by
[00:20:58.661 --> 00:21:01.004]  You know, telling the public that they were there.
[00:21:01.004 --> 00:21:01.965]  Well, they were there.
[00:21:01.965 --> 00:21:03.427]  They must have known what would have happened.
[00:21:03.427 --> 00:21:06.411]  Well, I mean, how many... Let's go back to what you just said earlier.
[00:21:06.411 --> 00:21:08.293]  I've interviewed a bunch of police officers.
[00:21:08.293 --> 00:21:11.677]  Next week, we're going to literally have like 15 guests on concerning this.
[00:21:11.677 --> 00:21:14.641]  We're lining them all up because I've had them all on, but I want to have them on separate.
[00:21:15.201 --> 00:21:16.262]  I mean, we've had them on separate.
[00:21:16.262 --> 00:21:17.484]  I want them on together.
[00:21:17.484 --> 00:21:22.929]  Firefighters, police, emergency workers, EMTs saying they were told, get back from 7.
[00:21:22.929 --> 00:21:25.572]  The government's going to blow it up for everyone's safety.
[00:21:25.572 --> 00:21:26.353]  Get back.
[00:21:26.353 --> 00:21:28.215]  People saying they saw bombs go off.
[00:21:28.215 --> 00:21:33.220]  Firemen saying it was like molten steel, like lava, which jet fuel can't do.
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.821]  On and on and on.
[00:21:34.821 --> 00:21:36.063]  Again, the majority
[00:21:36.983 --> 00:21:38.925]  I'd like to ask you during the break, my memory's failing me today.
[00:21:38.925 --> 00:21:41.407]  I interviewed him about a year ago.
[00:21:41.407 --> 00:21:45.511]  Who's the head of the 7,000 plus victims group, Doyle?
[00:21:45.511 --> 00:21:51.436]  Bill Doyle, who lost his son, Joey Doyle, came on my show.
[00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:53.098]  This is a guy you've seen all over the news, folks.
[00:21:53.098 --> 00:21:54.219]  The head of the biggest group.
[00:21:54.219 --> 00:21:55.480]  And said, yes, the government did it.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.341]  I didn't believe it.
[00:21:56.341 --> 00:21:57.141]  I looked into it.
[00:21:57.141 --> 00:21:57.582]  They did it.
[00:21:57.762 --> 00:21:59.383]  And I said, how many in your group believe it?
[00:21:59.383 --> 00:22:03.124]  He said more than half believe the government did it, and the rest are starting to think it.
[00:22:03.124 --> 00:22:04.785]  So I want that in an article too.
[00:22:04.785 --> 00:22:06.586]  I want the mother of all articles.
[00:22:06.586 --> 00:22:11.868]  I want to discredit every second they said with video, documents, missed reports.
[00:22:11.868 --> 00:22:13.469]  I'm just going to crush you!
[00:22:13.469 --> 00:22:15.269]  New World Order, we're coming at you!
[00:22:15.269 --> 00:22:17.690]  I just love the fact you lied and twisted.
[00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:18.711]  We've got you now!
[00:22:23.484 --> 00:22:30.008]  Paul, I got loaded phone lines, but I want to do just about four minutes with you on the other side, because I want you to be able to get into any other facets.
[00:22:30.008 --> 00:22:31.989]  You guys got me laughing in there, and I got cameras in here.
[00:22:31.989 --> 00:22:35.091]  The guys in the control room are laughing at me.
[00:22:35.091 --> 00:22:35.951]  It makes me laugh.
[00:22:35.951 --> 00:22:38.253]  This is not a laughing matter.
[00:22:38.253 --> 00:22:38.913]  Paul, stay there.
[00:22:38.913 --> 00:22:41.034]  Let's do about three or four minutes on the other side, alright?
[00:22:41.034 --> 00:22:43.176]  Alright, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:43.176 --> 00:22:46.938]  Paul Watson is our guest joining us from England, and I just love it.
[00:22:46.938 --> 00:22:51.561]  The New World Order just gets themselves deeper and deeper into trouble every time with their propaganda.
[00:22:51.561 --> 00:22:52.021]  We will now
[00:22:52.894 --> 00:22:53.920]  Debunk them.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.067]  Debunking the debunkers.
[00:22:55.067 --> 00:22:55.429]  Stay with us.
[00:23:02.388 --> 00:23:03.429]  Hey, Bill.
[00:23:03.429 --> 00:23:04.850]  I'm buying lunch today.
[00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:05.970]  And check this out.
[00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:06.971]  I bought a new car.
[00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:07.692]  Wow, John.
[00:23:07.692 --> 00:23:12.815]  I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[00:23:12.815 --> 00:23:17.278]  www.DidYouRobBillGates.com I did, and you were right.
[00:23:17.278 --> 00:23:22.641]  I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:23:22.641 --> 00:23:25.403]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:23:25.403 --> 00:23:29.005]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[00:23:29.005 --> 00:23:29.906]  Whoa, that's awesome.
[00:23:30.246 --> 00:23:33.008]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[00:23:33.008 --> 00:23:35.389]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[00:23:35.389 --> 00:23:36.430]  It's incredible!
[00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:44.255]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[00:23:44.255 --> 00:23:49.819]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:23:49.819 --> 00:23:50.979]  Check, please.
[00:23:50.979 --> 00:23:52.260]  I got this one, Bill.
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.101]  Sure, John.
[00:23:53.101 --> 00:23:57.864]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:23:57.864 --> 00:23:58.124]  Deal.
[00:24:02.589 --> 00:24:05.331]  News Radio 590 KLBJ, I'm Jeff Chapman.
[00:24:05.331 --> 00:24:07.092]  Good afternoon, it's 5.30.
[00:24:07.092 --> 00:24:16.417]  Topping Austin's news, State Minority Leader Mitch McConnell criticizes Democrats on CNN's Late Edition Sunday for their opposition to President Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq.
[00:24:16.417 --> 00:24:21.580]  They confirmed General Petraeus 81-0 to go out and try to succeed in this mission.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.583]  We ought to give him some support and give him a chance to succeed.
[00:24:37.097 --> 00:24:44.082]  The overall winner in Austin of the women's division in the AT&T-Austin Marathon was Zenebaye Moges of Ethiopia.
[00:24:44.082 --> 00:24:47.024]  Her translator said the race was very difficult for her.
[00:24:47.024 --> 00:24:48.446]  Yeah, because she's very cold.
[00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:52.248]  Because she's coming from Africa, it's hot now there.
[00:24:52.248 --> 00:24:58.073]  The men's winner was 20-year-old Kenyan Genesee Boswati Derek Williamson of Austin, coming first in the half marathon.
[00:24:58.073 --> 00:25:03.677]  I'm Jeff Chapman, live local news every half hour and breaking news right away from Austin's 24-hour news station, News Radio 590-KLBJ.
[00:25:05.658 --> 00:25:06.399]  We're good to go.
[00:25:23.675 --> 00:25:26.876]  Prefer cash over getting a gift card.
[00:25:26.876 --> 00:25:29.276]  Here's the challenge for you guys.
[00:25:29.276 --> 00:25:35.938]  How do you know whether the woman you're buying something for would prefer cash or a gift card?
[00:25:35.938 --> 00:25:38.658]  You don't want to offend them, so that's the tough thing.
[00:25:38.658 --> 00:25:42.839]  But gift cards offend me because they're such a bad deal.
[00:25:42.839 --> 00:25:50.901]  If you want to give somebody something but you don't know what to give them, cash is much better than a gift card that comes with all kinds of strings attached.
[00:25:51.443 --> 00:25:52.584]  Dad, can I ask you something?
[00:25:52.584 --> 00:25:53.024]  Sure.
[00:25:53.024 --> 00:25:54.566]  There's this girl I kind of like.
[00:25:54.566 --> 00:25:55.346]  Say no more.
[00:25:55.346 --> 00:25:56.728]  You just have to impress her.
[00:25:56.728 --> 00:25:57.969]  Okay, but how?
[00:25:57.969 --> 00:26:00.131]  Just pick up a lot of heavy things around her.
[00:26:00.131 --> 00:26:00.671]  Like what?
[00:26:00.671 --> 00:26:02.433]  You know, desks, chairs, people.
[00:26:02.433 --> 00:26:03.433]  Grunt if you have to.
[00:26:03.433 --> 00:26:03.794]  Grunt?
[00:26:03.794 --> 00:26:04.434]  Yeah, be like...
[00:26:07.577 --> 00:26:08.118]  There you go.
[00:26:08.118 --> 00:26:09.980]  You don't have to be perfect to be a perfect parent.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:13.123]  When you adopt a child from foster care, just being there makes all the difference.
[00:26:13.123 --> 00:26:16.386]  To learn more call 1-888-200-4005.
[00:26:16.386 --> 00:26:19.390]  A public service announcement brought to you by AdoptUSKids, the U.S.
[00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.532]  Department of Health and Human Services, and the Ad Council.
[00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.131]  Rush Limbaugh.
[00:26:28.131 --> 00:26:37.499]  The drive-by media is invested in our defeat so that they can demonstrate to themselves their power to influence worldwide and national events.
[00:26:37.499 --> 00:26:43.343]  There is no question that there's a shadow government somewhere and it's got the cooperation of the drive-by media.
[00:26:43.343 --> 00:26:48.127]  Defeating the United States in the war in Iraq, the war on terror, is clearly
[00:26:49.085 --> 00:26:52.407]  At the top of the agenda, Rush is live!
[00:26:52.407 --> 00:27:00.210]  Weekdays from 11 to 2 on News Radio 590 KLPJ.
[00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.190]  Listen carefully.
[00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:04.972]  Do you know what that is?
[00:27:04.972 --> 00:27:07.693]  That's the sound of someone being there.
[00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:09.854]  The sound of someone caring about a kid.
[00:27:24.828 --> 00:27:38.216]  Alright, Paul Watson, you talked about one of the police officers I interviewed at the memorials, an admitted hero, he's been in the newspaper as a hero, talking about the bombs going off, everybody being told to get back from the buildings.
[00:27:38.897 --> 00:27:40.237]  Right, well, you make reference to Craig Bartmer.
[00:28:05.379 --> 00:28:11.004]  Who was a former NYPD official who was in the service on the day of 9-11.
[00:28:11.004 --> 00:28:15.667]  He went down there to help out his buddies.
[00:28:15.667 --> 00:28:19.771]  Got the call through the radio that Building 7 was about to be brought down.
[00:28:20.925 --> 00:28:23.987]  He was running away from it when it was collapsing.
[00:28:23.987 --> 00:28:26.028]  And by the way, we don't just have him.
[00:28:26.028 --> 00:28:28.930]  We have CNN with two cops going, get back, they're going to blow the building up.
[00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:30.431]  They're bringing seven down.
[00:28:30.431 --> 00:28:34.914]  And then we have all the other firefighters, EMTs we've interviewed saying, yeah, they said they were going to blow it up.
[00:28:34.914 --> 00:28:36.095]  There's dozens.
[00:28:36.095 --> 00:28:39.077]  He heard the bombs tearing down the building as he ran away from it.
[00:28:39.637 --> 00:28:52.809]  Well, in this documentary, the only quote of a fireman or first responder that they use is somebody who says that the sprinkler systems in Building 7 have been damaged.
[00:28:52.809 --> 00:28:56.231]  Therefore, that then led them to make the case that Building 7 was
[00:28:57.336 --> 00:29:00.939]  Um, imploded because the fires were out of control and that's what caused it.
[00:29:00.939 --> 00:29:10.288]  But how do you plant bombs and the government says they didn't blow it up, now they're trying to admit they did blow it up, but let's be clear, they interviewed him, did they even use him in the film?
[00:29:10.288 --> 00:29:20.437]  No, they didn't use any first responder or fireman, even, they didn't even quote the official tapes from within the towers that reported bombs going off, yet they used this
[00:29:21.097 --> 00:29:25.479]  Yeah, they got fire captains in there going, we've knocked the fires down to almost nothing.
[00:29:25.479 --> 00:29:25.819]  Wait!
[00:29:25.819 --> 00:29:26.680]  There's explosions!
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.540]  We've got explosives!
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.281]  We've got bombs!
[00:29:28.281 --> 00:29:30.042]  I mean, what more do you need?
[00:29:30.042 --> 00:29:31.362]  We've played all these!
[00:29:31.362 --> 00:29:33.803]  No mention of the bombs in the basement either.
[00:29:33.803 --> 00:29:39.106]  No mention of the molten pools, you know, under the towers weeks after.
[00:29:39.804 --> 00:29:45.990]  They didn't use any quotes from Firemen on the Day, but they used this one to back up the narrative.
[00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.653]  Well, we've got to do, if it takes a five-parter, we've got to do it.
[00:29:48.653 --> 00:29:51.496]  We've got to decipher and break down everything.
[00:29:51.496 --> 00:29:57.502]  I mean, don't they know that this just digs a deeper hole for them when they do these type of shoddy jobs?
[00:29:58.348 --> 00:30:16.415]  Well, it became so obvious that at the end the sardonic sneering female narrator, just to mirror what these producers did in your company before they'd even finished filming this production, she was giggling at the end of the program saying that
[00:30:17.336 --> 00:30:20.480]  The conspiracy theories are nothing more than theories.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.644]  And when she said the word theory, she was actually giggling.
[00:30:23.644 --> 00:30:26.848]  So that's your balanced BBC, the narrator.
[00:30:26.848 --> 00:30:27.508]  Let's be clear.
[00:30:27.508 --> 00:30:29.191]  We got a former Fox exec.
[00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:44.044]  I mean, Viet Dinh's on the Fox board of directors, the guy that wrote the Patriot Act, he involved in this and we had internal BBC reports saying this was going to be the mother, that previously it wasn't big enough of a hit piece, so they went in and re-edited it.
[00:30:44.044 --> 00:30:50.486]  I talked to Guy Smith on Friday, the director, he denied that but said he couldn't come on Friday because they were still editing.
[00:30:51.354 --> 00:31:00.624]  Right, it was always going to be a hit piece, but the pressure from harming BBC's corporate interests in America obviously made them go all the way.
[00:31:00.624 --> 00:31:04.448]  Now Smith also, you found out, is involved with the Ford Foundation?
[00:31:04.448 --> 00:31:13.017]  Oh yeah, Mr. Guy Smith is a consultant for the Innovation Corporation, which is a
[00:31:14.589 --> 00:31:17.911]  Uh, a media consultancy agency.
[00:31:17.911 --> 00:31:23.833]  It's run by, uh, an individual that is in the Ford Foundation.
[00:31:23.833 --> 00:31:29.135]  So, that gives you an... It's basically the BBC, what they were trying to achieve in this production.
[00:31:29.135 --> 00:31:31.296]  It is government television, by the way.
[00:31:31.296 --> 00:31:33.617]  Yes, that's what we pay our license for.
[00:31:33.617 --> 00:31:34.418]  It's a tax.
[00:31:34.418 --> 00:31:37.499]  We get taxed for this government propaganda in this country.
[00:31:38.456 --> 00:31:45.198]  They're repeaters, and they want to repeat the establishment line, because they're part of the establishment.
[00:31:45.198 --> 00:31:53.061]  And they weave all these psychological webs about how we need 9-11, we need to think it's something more than 19 Arabs.
[00:31:53.061 --> 00:31:53.681]  Oh, that's right!
[00:31:53.681 --> 00:31:55.982]  It's too scary to think 19 Arabs did it.
[00:31:55.982 --> 00:31:59.363]  It's not scary to think we have a criminal government that did it.
[00:31:59.363 --> 00:32:04.805]  And it's a mentally ill religion that we have, which they put on their website before they even aired it.
[00:32:04.805 --> 00:32:06.105]  Hey, we're just going off the facts.
[00:32:06.485 --> 00:32:09.767]  And I kept saying, won't you talk about Northwoods, the declassified U.S.
[00:32:09.767 --> 00:32:13.648]  government plan to hijack jets, bomb D.C., blame it on foreign enemies?
[00:32:13.648 --> 00:32:16.810]  Won't you talk about Gulf of Tonkin, that they now admit was staged?
[00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:20.411]  Won't you talk- and then no, no, we're not talking about any of that.
[00:32:20.411 --> 00:32:30.116]  No, and they had you talking about, um, our leaders have lied to us again and again, and they said they needed, uh, an event like this to launch a pre-planned war.
[00:32:31.152 --> 00:32:41.663]  Whereas they would support the debunkers with further evidence via the narrative of what they had said, they did not mention PNAC after you said that.
[00:32:41.663 --> 00:32:43.485]  And that was a tactic used time and time again.
[00:32:43.485 --> 00:32:44.285]  Which is what I did.
[00:32:44.285 --> 00:32:45.387]  I used their own documents.
[00:32:45.387 --> 00:32:49.771]  I gave them stacks of mainstream reports in their own documents.
[00:32:49.771 --> 00:32:50.372]  Right.
[00:32:50.372 --> 00:32:53.074]  And no mention whatsoever of Northwoods either.
[00:32:53.074 --> 00:32:54.436]  And they tried to play it as if
[00:32:55.356 --> 00:32:59.939]  The people we're interviewing, these experts, were there, you know, there at the scene.
[00:32:59.939 --> 00:33:10.127]  And they even interviewed the popular mechanics, Yellow Journalism, Hurst Publishing guy, at Ground Zero, just to give the impression that he was there as well.
[00:33:10.127 --> 00:33:16.091]  And then Homeland Security Director's first cousin is the guy that directed the whole piece.
[00:33:16.571 --> 00:33:17.111]  Right, and then
[00:33:36.698 --> 00:33:47.142]  Just with the facts of it, they said that the Flight 93 debris field was not 8 miles wide when the FBI and the NTSB admitted that it was.
[00:33:47.142 --> 00:33:49.303]  And we have the Associated Press.
[00:33:49.303 --> 00:33:54.225]  Yeah, and crash debris found 8 miles away, Pittsburgh Tribune Review.
[00:33:55.077 --> 00:34:08.906]  They found papers from mail that was being transported from the plane eight miles from the crash site and that's admitted by the FBI but they just lied and said they basically implied that you made that up just because the river was one mile.
[00:34:08.906 --> 00:34:13.389]  Oh that was done here at the studios at the end of the radio interview they were in here videotaping that.
[00:34:13.809 --> 00:34:15.130]  I mean, and they had Spotnitz, the X-Files guy.
[00:34:40.347 --> 00:34:52.814]  I mean, it was like... They had the creator of the X-Files, I've seen that clip, that's what they promoted, going, they're just mentally ill and they need to believe this, and it's just... and they get very upset, but they never exposed any of our facts, did they?
[00:34:52.814 --> 00:35:04.280]  No, and he was sat there talking uninterrupted for like three or four minutes, whereas yourself or Dylan Avery got ten seconds at best.
[00:35:05.228 --> 00:35:14.596]  And then it was told so, as they were backed up, the debunkers, via the narrative, whereas you were dismissed as evangelists and dropouts.
[00:35:14.596 --> 00:35:25.065]  Well, you know, in a contract agreement I signed with them, I said, you've got to mention Infowars.com, and I guess that's why they put it on the BBC website, but accidentally got the link dead.
[00:35:25.065 --> 00:35:32.171]  Yeah, they also accidentally got the links dead to the 9-11 Commission on the NIS report, even though people had been emailing after.
[00:35:32.811 --> 00:35:35.734]  And they didn't correct them, just by accident.
[00:35:35.734 --> 00:35:41.960]  Yeah, they want to go, here's the link to the report, but they don't want you to actually go read the NIS report that says, no, bombs could have been in the buildings.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.921]  Oh no, can't have that!
[00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:47.685]  Just say the NIS report says something else, and then, oh, the link's dead!
[00:35:47.685 --> 00:35:48.566]  We're sorry!
[00:35:48.566 --> 00:35:57.414]  And, uh, Guy Smith, when you talked to him on Friday, said, assured you that it was a balanced piece, and then hours after,
[00:35:58.198 --> 00:36:18.325]  Up on the BBC website goes this questions and answers what really happened, which was basically paraphrased from the Popular Mechanics piece, where they narrowly focused in, for example, on the demolition and said, oh, these squibs are just ejections of smoke as the floors are pressed onto one another.
[00:36:18.325 --> 00:36:19.826]  End of story.
[00:36:19.826 --> 00:36:23.107]  But they're exploding seconds before it collapses.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:36.322]  Right, so you've got this litany of supposed debunked questions about 9-11, which appear two days before the documentary, and yet this guy's still telling us that it's the balance piece.
[00:36:36.322 --> 00:36:40.383]  But he's supposedly coming on my Monday syndicated show tomorrow.
[00:36:40.383 --> 00:36:42.163]  Paul, thanks for spending time.
[00:36:42.163 --> 00:36:43.324]  Hit him hard.
[00:36:43.324 --> 00:36:44.584]  Get the reports out quick.
[00:36:44.584 --> 00:36:48.945]  Get a basic report out, and then I want a detailed report on PrisonPlanet.com by tomorrow.
[00:36:48.945 --> 00:36:49.885]  Thank you, Paul.
[00:36:49.885 --> 00:36:50.405]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:36:51.005 --> 00:36:52.467]  All right, absolutely incredible.
[00:36:52.467 --> 00:37:00.133]  All right, I promise we'll go to TJ, George, Airman, and others, then get into the FBI staging the Nazi rally.
[00:37:00.133 --> 00:37:00.534]  Stay with us.
