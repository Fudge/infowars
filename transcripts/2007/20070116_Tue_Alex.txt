[00:00:05.493 --> 00:00:06.133]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:07.835]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.556 --> 00:00:09.677]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.338 --> 00:00:11.139]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.801]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:17.346]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.646 --> 00:00:21.731]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.187]  Deep behind enemy lines, Austin, Texas, you are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:33.429]  It is the 16th day of January, 2007.
[00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:39.096]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones today and tomorrow.
[00:00:39.256 --> 00:00:46.464]  Alex will be back next week, spending some much-needed time with his family, recharging his batteries so he can jump in with both feet.
[00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:57.023]  To fight for you, your families, and to fight the New World Order, and to continue on with the 2007 edition of the InfoWar.
[00:00:57.403 --> 00:01:01.547]  I'm Jack Blood from Deadline Live, again filling in for Alex Jones today.
[00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:03.628]  We have a ton of news to report.
[00:01:03.668 --> 00:01:09.333]  We'll be taking some of your calls, we'll be playing a few clips, and we will have a few guests.
[00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:15.398]  Joining us at the top of the second hour, Sal Costello, TexasTollParty.com.
[00:01:16.068 --> 00:01:22.990]  Sal and his group have been fighting the toll roads down here in the NAFTA Highway all now for about two and a half, three years.
[00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.391]  They are relentless.
[00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.311]  They never give up.
[00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.931]  They have had some victories.
[00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:31.173]  A big vote tonight, a Campo vote if you live here in Texas.
[00:01:31.773 --> 00:01:36.054]  Sorry, tomorrow night and something that we certainly want to promote here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:36.414 --> 00:01:44.317]  Joining us in the third hour on the broadcast today, Dean Lawrence Velville of the Massachusetts School of Law.
[00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:59.710]  They are sending out ultimatums to the President, to your government, and they are charging a march of unprecedented size if the Congress does not stop the Iraq War.
[00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:01.913]  They're buckling in.
[00:02:02.952 --> 00:02:06.298]  For a long ride here with Iraq, and we'll have Dean Velville.
[00:02:06.338 --> 00:02:16.495]  He also once sued President Nixon to try to stop the Vietnam War, chastised Congressional Democratic leadership for stating that they will not cut off funds for the US troops.
[00:02:18.022 --> 00:02:27.306]  And he is a constitutionalist, folks, so we'll be honored to have the Dean with us, Dean Lawrence Velville, joining us in the third hour of our broadcast today.
[00:02:27.526 --> 00:02:34.969]  Here's what we're going to get to, or try to get to, during the program, and specifically here in the first hour, we'll talk more about Iran.
[00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:40.651]  Robert Gates, your new Secretary of Defense, has come out and admitted that
[00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.844]  The build-up, the military build-up in the Persian Gulf is for Iran.
[00:02:46.084 --> 00:02:47.045]  Sorry, Iran.
[00:02:47.105 --> 00:02:47.806]  I keep doing that.
[00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:52.931]  Also, has the Iran war already started?
[00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:56.735]  This is what Haratz.com is writing, and this is coming right out of Israel.
[00:02:56.815 --> 00:02:57.496]  Also, regarding Iran,
[00:02:59.406 --> 00:03:03.069]  They get missiles from Russia, which of course would be great for propaganda.
[00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.833]  That is, if it wasn't also revealed, they've received army gear from the Pentagon.
[00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:08.313]  That's right.
[00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:15.279]  We're about to, or potentially, or allegedly, go to war in Iran, and we're sending them the army gear to fight us.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.262]  We'll talk a little bit about Cheney and spying and
[00:03:19.947 --> 00:03:25.430]  The fact that Bush and Cheney just haven't blinked since they lost Congress and the Senate.
[00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.172]  They obviously know something that you and I do not, or they are insane.
[00:03:30.192 --> 00:03:32.213]  I guess you can look at it either way.
[00:03:32.874 --> 00:03:35.575]  Of course, Bush, the script reader, just not in the loop.
[00:03:35.595 --> 00:03:43.459]  I don't think he quite understands the level of hatred of not just Americans, but people around the world.
[00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:46.521]  And not for America, but for the Bush administration, for the neocons.
[00:03:47.338 --> 00:03:51.281]  We'll also talk about a law that could come into effect.
[00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:54.644]  I put that law in the quotations because some of you know what that means.
[00:03:55.725 --> 00:03:59.508]  Regarding disclosure of government data mining, this could become U.S.
[00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:00.189]  law.
[00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.310]  We'll try to talk about that.
[00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:09.837]  The Scooter Libby trial begins and people talking about how this could become a high-profile bloodletting, no pun intended,
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.520]  We'll talk a little bit about it.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.142]  We have time today, and if not, we'll try to get to this tomorrow, or we'll get to this sometime in my five hours on the air today with GCN.
[00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:22.343]  The 7-7 bombings.
[00:04:22.623 --> 00:04:27.624]  A lot of new developments in that, including the trial of the staged copycat bomber.
[00:04:28.624 --> 00:04:38.347]  Of course, they didn't really have any evidence, or no evidence that they've been able to share with us here, the public at large, regarding the 7-7 bombing, and who might be guilty of that.
[00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:49.561]  So they staged a copycat event and got that all on film, so that should certainly convince anybody out there who doesn't believe that 7-7 is a staged government-sponsored terror attack.
[00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.063]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:52.405]  We'll be right back after this, folks.
[00:04:52.465 --> 00:04:53.347]  Please stay tuned.
[00:05:04.176 --> 00:05:04.636]  It's here!
[00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:09.618]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:17.662]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.342 --> 00:05:25.405]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:32.648]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.182]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.522 --> 00:05:41.064]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.484 --> 00:05:43.405]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.745 --> 00:05:47.667]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:00.692 --> 00:07:05.273]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:07:05.673 --> 00:07:08.594]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:07:08.914 --> 00:07:11.475]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:07:11.855 --> 00:07:16.676]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:07:17.057 --> 00:07:22.418]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:07:22.718 --> 00:07:25.679]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:26.519]  We're good to go.
[00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:54.475]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:07:54.495 --> 00:07:54.835]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:07:54.895 --> 00:07:58.018]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:58.038 --> 00:07:59.039]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.385 --> 00:08:13.506]  Alright, thank you for joining us today.
[00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:22.349]  Obviously you care about this country or you'd be listening to some neocon screaming head like Lush Limpa.
[00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:31.333]  So you must care about your country, you must care about the world, you must care about yourself, your neighborhood, your neighbors, your co-workers, people on the street.
[00:08:32.156 --> 00:08:33.277]  Otherwise, why else would you tune in?
[00:08:33.337 --> 00:08:36.399]  I know I'm in trouble when we start off the first segment.
[00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:37.820]  It's a four to five minute segment.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:45.305]  I'm setting up the news and I run out of time before I can get out just the headlines that we want to talk about on the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:08:45.385 --> 00:08:50.529]  So, obviously we're not going to get to all of it, but we'll do our very best.
[00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:51.890]  New report out.
[00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.253]  Steve Watson came out Monday and I meant to get to this yesterday.
[00:08:57.009 --> 00:09:01.051]  Robert Gates, Iran is target of military build-up.
[00:09:01.151 --> 00:09:04.413]  Huge military deployment in Gulf is ominous.
[00:09:05.074 --> 00:09:07.495]  Neocon propaganda is mounting.
[00:09:07.955 --> 00:09:09.996]  Steve Watson, Infowars.net.
[00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:21.563]  The Defense Secretary Robert Gates today announced, that was yesterday, that the massive increase in military power in the Persian Gulf is directly aimed at Iran.
[00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:35.888]  Gates comments followed a weekend of intense and heavily loaded rhetoric on the part of many neocon figureheads signaling the faintest spark could ignite a huge escalation of the conflict in the Middle East.
[00:09:36.449 --> 00:09:42.974]  Speaking in Brussels after meeting NATO officials, Mr. Gates said, we are simply reaffirming that statement
[00:09:43.883 --> 00:09:53.972]  The importance of the Gulf region and the United States and our determination to be an ongoing strong presence in that area for a long time in the future.
[00:09:53.992 --> 00:09:55.994]  Now, some could call this saber-rattling.
[00:09:56.634 --> 00:10:03.300]  If so, it's extremely expensive and provocative in just about every sense of the word.
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.763]  Gates said that the Patriot... You'll like this, folks.
[00:10:07.304 --> 00:10:09.886]  Talk about Orwellian double-speak, news-speak.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:20.785]  Gates said that the Patriot anti-missile missiles, aircraft carriers, cruise missile firing ships have been deployed in order to show Iran that the U.S.
[00:10:20.845 --> 00:10:24.808]  means business and will not be distracted by the turmoil in Iraq.
[00:10:25.228 --> 00:10:30.591]  The buildup has now been going on for weeks and shows no sign of being purely a warning.
[00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:34.573]  The Patriot missiles are intended to shoot down Iranian missiles.
[00:10:35.533 --> 00:10:38.375]  The naval forces are there to preempt Iranian
[00:10:39.364 --> 00:10:45.549]  Interference with oil shipments, which would immediately cause retaliations to any strike.
[00:10:45.589 --> 00:11:05.485]  A former commander of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Edward Bolton, yesterday revealed that he believes a missile attack on the Iranians is imminent, while Republican congressman and 2008 presidential candidate Ron Paul fears a staged Gulf of Tonkin-style incident may be used to provoke these airstrikes in Iran.
[00:11:05.505 --> 00:11:08.608]  In fact, this is a new war!
[00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:15.286]  And Ron Paul makes this very succinct in his speech before Congress, which was aired on C-SPAN.
[00:11:15.306 --> 00:11:17.167]  We're going to play that here in just a little bit.
[00:11:18.689 --> 00:11:26.054]  But the fact that Bush needs, and Bush and Cheney, President Cheney, needs to have new authorization for war.
[00:11:26.114 --> 00:11:31.339]  He just doesn't have a blank check on the international war on terror as much as he might think that he does.
[00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:34.021]  We'll talk to our guest in the third hour about this specifically.
[00:11:35.166 --> 00:11:36.387]  So what is needed?
[00:11:36.507 --> 00:11:43.114]  What will scare Congress into not voting against authorization for war against Iran?
[00:11:43.154 --> 00:11:45.276]  Of course, Ron Paul nails it!
[00:11:45.296 --> 00:11:47.919]  It is a Golf of Tonkin style event.
[00:11:48.019 --> 00:11:53.645]  Indeed, the Far News Agency reported yesterday that there have already been rumors of non-existent clashes
[00:11:54.957 --> 00:12:01.258]  These are rumors of non-existent clashes between Iranian and American battleships in Persian Gulf waters.
[00:12:01.758 --> 00:12:07.139]  A senior Iranian official viewed the rumor as part of the enemy's psychological war in Iran.
[00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:12.400]  And basically what they're saying here is there doesn't even have to be a Gulf of Tonkin incident.
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.500]  There just has to be rumors of one.
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.861]  And maybe that will be enough.
[00:12:15.921 --> 00:12:23.662]  I'm sure there's some type of beta test going on here just to see exactly what reaction there might be to these rumors.
[00:12:24.162 --> 00:12:29.205]  Last week, U.S.-led forces in northern Iraq arrested five Iranians who the U.S.
[00:12:29.245 --> 00:12:37.650]  military says were connected to an Iranian Revolutionary Guard faction that funds and arms insurgents in Iraq, a claim that Iran has also rejected.
[00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.032]  I would assume they have proof, or at least manufactured proof of that.
[00:12:42.093 --> 00:12:44.034]  This sudden assertion is comical.
[00:12:44.094 --> 00:12:48.957]  Why would Iranian Shiites want to arm Iraqi Sunnis?
[00:12:49.037 --> 00:12:51.959]  writes Steve Watson, and that's an excellent observation.
[00:12:53.692 --> 00:12:58.176]  Who would want to kill Iraqi Shiites allied with Iran?
[00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:00.518]  A few appearances on the U.S.
[00:13:00.558 --> 00:13:21.836]  propaganda outlets by the neocons are supposed to convince us that this is now the case, however, this is much like a story that came out, we still have it up at jackblood.com, probably came out about six, eight months ago, big headline story, it was such a joke that we actually covered it as comedy and not as news, and that was
[00:13:22.674 --> 00:13:26.516]  Osama Bin Laden's son is up working with the Iranians.
[00:13:27.337 --> 00:13:28.658]  They're a vowed enemy.
[00:13:29.538 --> 00:13:31.039]  The Jihad-backed Persians.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:38.263]  This is what, if you read any of Greg Palast's work in his new book, Armed Madhouse, is fantastic on a lot of levels.
[00:13:38.564 --> 00:13:52.132]  He goes over this, and the fact that Bush, the Saudis, and allegedly Osama Bin Laden, Mr. Goldstein, all seem to have the same objectives, and that is to put out and to create a Islamist
[00:13:53.169 --> 00:13:57.051]  Superstate, which wouldn't likely include the Persians or the Shiites.
[00:13:57.071 --> 00:14:05.976]  So these people are mortal enemies, and this, of course, can be understood if you just take a look at the news in Iraq at any time, where they're killing each other.
[00:14:06.756 --> 00:14:22.245]  But they want us to believe this, and they consider the fact that, you know, we're dumbed down and we're stupid and we'll get all hyped up if Sean Vanity says something, or if Limp Baw says something, we'll all, at least 16% of us, that seems to be the numbers, will support the war.
[00:14:22.924 --> 00:14:24.265]  I guess that's all they feel they need.
[00:14:24.305 --> 00:14:26.346]  That's a democracy, of course, folks.
[00:14:27.087 --> 00:14:30.189]  Has the war with Iran already started?
[00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:34.312]  This is being covered in Rosner's blog on Haratz.com.
[00:14:35.392 --> 00:14:51.883]  Senator Joe Biden, the Democrat from Delaware who's going to be running for president again, major gatekeeper, by the way, he spotted it at the end of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Biden looked sternly at the Secretary and made one last point.
[00:14:53.391 --> 00:15:06.177]  If the President concluded he had to invade Iran or Syria in pursuit of these networks, I believe the present authorization granted to the President to use force in Iraq does not cover that, and he does need Congressional authority to do that.
[00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.999]  I just wanted to set that marker.
[00:15:09.079 --> 00:15:10.639]  Well, isn't that nice of you?
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.742]  So the marker was set, but on the ground events were already moving ahead of it.
[00:15:16.969 --> 00:15:18.210]  Last Thursday, U.S.
[00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:23.313]  forces raided Iranian targets in Ibril, Iraq, and detained five Iranian officials.
[00:15:23.873 --> 00:15:24.894]  Again, we just talked about that.
[00:15:24.954 --> 00:15:32.519]  As he mentioned in Wednesday night's speech, President Bush has ordered a second aircraft carrier, along with the support ships, to the Gulf.
[00:15:32.959 --> 00:15:43.886]  Succeeding in Iraq already requires defending its national integrity and stabilization in the reason in the face of extremist challenges, said the President.
[00:15:45.009 --> 00:15:46.310]  I think I mucked that up worse than he did.
[00:15:47.371 --> 00:15:50.293]  This begins with addressing Iran and Syria, he went on to say.
[00:15:50.813 --> 00:15:52.274]  And the comparisons will be made.
[00:15:52.314 --> 00:16:01.740]  If Bush was once Lyndon Johnson in Iraq and Vietnam, the President will now become Richard Nixon and Iran will serve as the neighboring Cambodia.
[00:16:02.221 --> 00:16:11.527]  Some of us remember 1970 Madam Secretary, Senator Chuck Hagel, who's been just all over Bush on this troop surge thing, a Republican out of Nebraska.
[00:16:12.386 --> 00:16:14.568]  Don't get me started on Hagel and his voting machines.
[00:16:14.888 --> 00:16:17.971]  But he told Rice, quote, and that was Cambodia.
[00:16:18.451 --> 00:16:23.876]  And when our government lied to the American people and said we didn't cross the border going to Cambodia, in fact we did.
[00:16:24.257 --> 00:16:30.362]  And you know, folks, this is what Haratz probably isn't going to cover and what we've mentioned numerous times.
[00:16:30.422 --> 00:16:34.446]  We're told by President Cheney, I mean President Bush, that
[00:16:35.623 --> 00:16:37.864]  Junior, as I think people call him.
[00:16:37.944 --> 00:16:40.005]  Temporary, as he's called in Skull and Bones.
[00:16:40.425 --> 00:16:43.246]  We're told that if you're not with us, you're with the terrorists.
[00:16:43.386 --> 00:16:51.068]  Anybody harboring or working with terrorists will suffer the wrath of the government.
[00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:58.471]  And here we are, working with MEK, which are a known terrorist organization.
[00:16:58.491 --> 00:17:00.892]  We arrested these guys in Iraq, allegedly.
[00:17:01.852 --> 00:17:05.154]  And now they're working for us inside and around Iran.
[00:17:05.194 --> 00:17:06.795]  These are terrorists.
[00:17:07.495 --> 00:17:13.158]  Much like we're protecting Luis Posada, terrorist bomber, here in this country.
[00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:16.700]  Because there are good terrorists and there are bad terrorists.
[00:17:18.241 --> 00:17:20.021]  Bad terrorists in Iran.
[00:17:20.402 --> 00:17:22.483]  Good terrorists in Pakistan.
[00:17:25.384 --> 00:17:28.466]  So it is the ultimate level of hypocrisy
[00:17:29.764 --> 00:17:42.787]  For George W. or Dick Cheney or any of these neocons or their supporters or their controllers to have us believe that we have to go into Iran, Iraq, Syria and the like because there are terrorists hiding there.
[00:17:43.887 --> 00:17:44.687]  We should know.
[00:17:44.707 --> 00:17:47.488]  Let's see how much time.
[00:17:47.508 --> 00:17:48.668]  We've got about three minutes here.
[00:17:48.688 --> 00:17:52.328]  I'm going to have to play this clip when we come back.
[00:17:55.444 --> 00:17:55.584]  Hmm.
[00:17:55.944 --> 00:17:56.664]  Let's give it a shot.
[00:17:56.704 --> 00:17:58.025]  I think it's about two minutes long.
[00:17:58.105 --> 00:17:59.305]  Two, two, three minutes long.
[00:17:59.365 --> 00:18:00.506]  No, let's not give it a shot.
[00:18:00.606 --> 00:18:01.186]  Why push it?
[00:18:01.546 --> 00:18:04.847]  I want to play this clip of Ron Paul.
[00:18:05.567 --> 00:18:16.811]  I think it's about two, two, three minutes long, in front of Congress, really showing his muster, being bold, and talking about this next Gulf of Tonkin incident.
[00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:18.011]  This is being reported today.
[00:18:18.051 --> 00:18:19.512]  We'll just clean up this segment with this.
[00:18:20.012 --> 00:18:22.353]  Russian missiles delivered to Iran.
[00:18:23.273 --> 00:18:23.753]  Ivanov,
[00:18:25.211 --> 00:18:32.336]  Russia has delivered new anti-aircraft missile systems to Iran and will consider further requests by Tehran for defensive weapons.
[00:18:32.717 --> 00:18:45.046]  Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said earlier today, we have supplied the modern short-range anti-aircraft systems, the TOR-M1, in accordance with our contracts.
[00:18:45.386 --> 00:18:53.552]  Ivanov told reporters Iran is not under sanctions and if it wants to buy defensive equipment for its armed forces, then why not?
[00:18:54.201 --> 00:19:04.191]  Defense Ministry source later told Reuters deliveries of hardware under the $1 billion deal which has been criticized by the West have not yet been completed.
[00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:09.636]  Washington and Israel have criticized the contract to supply these missiles to Iran.
[00:19:10.277 --> 00:19:14.841]  Well, on the other side of the coin, this is out of the Associated Press today, the U.S.
[00:19:14.881 --> 00:19:17.744]  military has sold forbidden equipment
[00:19:18.889 --> 00:19:29.619]  At least a half a dozen times to middlemen for countries including Iran and China, who exploited security flaws in the Defense Department's surplus auctions.
[00:19:31.961 --> 00:19:33.182]  This is how these people get it.
[00:19:33.222 --> 00:19:34.303]  I mean, here's what we're being told.
[00:19:35.203 --> 00:19:44.672]  Iran and other Syria are providing these weapons to the fighters in Iraq, although there are these open-air bizarre sales
[00:19:45.743 --> 00:19:47.746]  Where you can buy U.S.
[00:19:47.906 --> 00:19:48.407]  equipment.
[00:19:48.527 --> 00:19:49.649]  Just anybody can buy it.
[00:19:51.672 --> 00:19:52.813]  We're going to talk more about this.
[00:19:52.834 --> 00:19:53.935]  I've got to play a couple of these clips.
[00:19:53.955 --> 00:19:58.121]  When we come back, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:58.201 --> 00:19:58.802]  I'm Jack Blood.
[00:19:58.822 --> 00:19:59.223]  Stay tuned.
[00:20:01.571 --> 00:20:06.539]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:16.615]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.

[00:20:33.647 --> 00:20:37.150]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:03.207]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:03.287 --> 00:21:10.110]  Did you know that at the 29 Palms Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.132]  It discussed the United States military under UN command.
[00:21:14.835 --> 00:21:16.275]  Would the Marines accept this?
[00:21:16.495 --> 00:21:27.259]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[00:21:27.739 --> 00:21:29.139]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:21:29.279 --> 00:21:31.080]  Forced confiscation of guns?
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:39.102]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:04.436 --> 00:22:13.344]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:13.825 --> 00:22:20.992]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:21.716 --> 00:22:27.217]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:22:45.062 --> 00:22:48.603]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:23:07.501 --> 00:23:12.324]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:23:12.524 --> 00:23:15.266]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:23:15.306 --> 00:23:16.426]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:23:17.767 --> 00:23:22.370]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:30.555]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:23:31.555 --> 00:23:34.597]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[00:23:36.747 --> 00:23:40.210]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:23:41.191 --> 00:23:42.472]  Call for your copy today.
[00:23:42.712 --> 00:23:44.934]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:45.975 --> 00:23:51.820]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:52.941]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:52.961 --> 00:23:53.181]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:14.203 --> 00:24:33.356]  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real
[00:24:36.604 --> 00:24:39.207]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:24:39.287 --> 00:24:43.952]  So you are listening to the Alex Jones Show and Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:24:43.972 --> 00:24:46.155]  It is Tuesday and we are live.
[00:24:46.175 --> 00:24:47.357]  We're going to go to your calls here.
[00:24:47.377 --> 00:24:49.319]  Try to slip a few calls in in this first hour.
[00:24:49.699 --> 00:24:51.782]  I've got to finish this news about Iran.
[00:24:51.802 --> 00:24:53.144]  I want to play this clip by
[00:24:54.004 --> 00:24:54.504]  Ron Paul.
[00:24:54.544 --> 00:24:56.305]  I also have another clip for you today.
[00:24:56.425 --> 00:24:57.466]  Ray McGovern.
[00:24:57.686 --> 00:24:59.947]  It's a little bit of a flashback from September.
[00:25:00.307 --> 00:25:01.648]  He talks about 9-11.
[00:25:01.948 --> 00:25:02.688]  Norman Mineta.
[00:25:02.728 --> 00:25:05.029]  We have some Norman Mineta testimony as well.
[00:25:05.069 --> 00:25:06.190]  It's about a six-minute clip.
[00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:09.851]  We're going to try to insert this into the program today.
[00:25:09.931 --> 00:25:12.052]  I think it's quite an eye-opener.
[00:25:12.072 --> 00:25:14.893]  I want to go back to this garage sale.
[00:25:14.973 --> 00:25:20.736]  These open bazaar sales of our used Pentagon parts.
[00:25:22.436 --> 00:25:30.982]  And according to federal investigators, Iran is anxious to get F-14 Tomcat fighter jets in the air, and they need parts to do that.
[00:25:31.022 --> 00:25:32.322]  Well, where are they getting them?
[00:25:32.883 --> 00:25:33.723]  Not from Russia!
[00:25:34.144 --> 00:25:35.064]  Not from Syria!
[00:25:35.725 --> 00:25:37.085]  Not from Hugo Chavez!
[00:25:37.646 --> 00:25:39.027]  Getting them from the United States.
[00:25:39.067 --> 00:25:45.571]  In one case, a convicted middleman for Iran bought Tomcat parts from the Defense Department's Surplus Division.
[00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:48.172]  How much money you got, folks?
[00:25:48.292 --> 00:25:50.334]  Maybe we need to start buying some of this stuff.
[00:25:51.129 --> 00:25:58.932]  But custom agents confiscated them after the sale, returned them back to the Pentagon, which sold them again.
[00:25:59.512 --> 00:26:05.995]  Customs evidence tags still attached to another buyer, a suspected broker for Iran.
[00:26:06.475 --> 00:26:12.478]  That incident appalled even an expert on weakness in the Pentagon's surplus security controls.
[00:26:12.578 --> 00:26:20.221]  Quote, that would be evidence of a significant breakdown in my view in controls and processes, said Greg Coots.
[00:26:20.862 --> 00:26:29.706]  The Government Accountability Office's head, the GAO's head of Special Investigations, quote, it shouldn't happen the first time, let alone the second time.
[00:26:29.746 --> 00:26:36.808]  Of course, what we're talking about here, folks, is plausible deniability using arms dealers and middlemen.
[00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:45.812]  George Herbert Walker Bush, an expert in this, by the way, and this is how they, this is how Saddam Hussein and others got a lot of their weapons.
[00:26:46.698 --> 00:26:55.485]  We don't actually sell them, we just kind of put them out so the black market can get them, where we know they're going to an alleged enemy, and I mean alleged.
[00:26:57.566 --> 00:27:12.258]  The Pentagon recently retired its Tomcats and it's shipping tens of thousands of spare parts to its surplus office, the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service, everything has to be Orwellian, where they could be sold in public auctions.
[00:27:12.618 --> 00:27:13.639]  Iran is
[00:27:14.643 --> 00:27:17.866]  Only the only other country flying F-14s.
[00:27:18.507 --> 00:27:27.715]  It stands to reason Iran will be even more aggressive seeking F-14 parts, said Stephen Bogney, head of Immigration, Customs, Enforcement, Arms, Export, Investigations.
[00:27:27.735 --> 00:27:28.535]  That's a mouthful.
[00:27:29.316 --> 00:27:31.698]  Iran can only produce about 15% of the parts itself.
[00:27:33.391 --> 00:27:46.866]  Sensitive military surplus items are supposed to be demilitarized or demilled, rendered useless for military purposes, or if auctioned, sold only to buyers who promise to obey U.S.
[00:27:47.107 --> 00:27:48.008]  arms embargoes.
[00:27:48.752 --> 00:27:50.854]  Export controls and other laws.
[00:27:50.894 --> 00:27:58.199]  The GAO, again the investigative arm of Congress, found it alarmingly easy to acquire sensitive surplus.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:10.348]  Last year, its agents bought 1.1 million worth of rocket launchers, body armor, and surveillance antennas by driving onto the base and posing as defense contractors.
[00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:13.671]  They helped us load our van, Kootz said.
[00:28:14.634 --> 00:28:25.604]  Investigators used fake identity to access a surplus website operated by the Pentagon contractor and bought still more, including dozens of microcircuits used in F-14 fighters.
[00:28:25.644 --> 00:28:31.669]  The undercover buyers received phone calls from the Defense Department asking why they had no Social Security number or credit history.
[00:28:32.378 --> 00:28:38.781]  But they deflected the questions by presenting a phony utility bill and claiming to be an identity theft victim.
[00:28:39.101 --> 00:28:39.862]  There you go, folks.
[00:28:39.882 --> 00:28:44.684]  If you want to know how to do it, it's right here off the Drudge Report.
[00:28:44.724 --> 00:28:47.385]  I assume I'm not talking out of class.
[00:28:48.546 --> 00:28:52.608]  The Pentagon's public surplus sales took in $57 million in fiscal 2005.
[00:28:52.648 --> 00:28:53.988]  $57 million selling black market spare parts.
[00:29:00.427 --> 00:29:10.234]  The agency also moves extra supplies around within the government and gives surplus military gear such as weapons, armored personnel carriers, and aircraft to state and local law enforcement.
[00:29:10.734 --> 00:29:15.818]  Investigators have found that the Pentagon's inventory and sales controls are rife with errors.
[00:29:16.358 --> 00:29:19.520]  They say the sales are closely watched by friends and foes of the United States.
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.181]  Among cases in which U.S.
[00:29:21.201 --> 00:29:27.445]  military technology made its way from surplus options to brokers for Iran, China, and others, there's a long, long list here.
[00:29:28.146 --> 00:29:29.607]  But it's just incompetence, folks.
[00:29:30.222 --> 00:29:32.543]  It's just more incompetence piled on top of incompetence.
[00:29:32.743 --> 00:29:34.004]  There's no agenda here.
[00:29:34.044 --> 00:29:34.884]  There's no plan.
[00:29:35.785 --> 00:29:36.645]  It's just incompetence.
[00:29:36.665 --> 00:29:37.346]  Don't worry about it.
[00:29:37.386 --> 00:29:38.806]  They have plausible deniability.
[00:29:39.026 --> 00:29:39.767]  We'll come right back.
[00:29:39.787 --> 00:29:40.467]  We'll air this clip.
[00:29:40.487 --> 00:29:41.288]  We'll go to your calls.
[00:29:41.308 --> 00:29:42.288]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:42.368 --> 00:29:43.268]  Infowars.com.
[00:29:43.288 --> 00:29:44.149]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:44.169 --> 00:29:44.589]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:51.493 --> 00:29:52.413]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.893 --> 00:29:54.514]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.435 --> 00:29:58.116]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:02.511]  It's no secret.
[00:30:02.771 --> 00:30:08.254]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[00:30:08.415 --> 00:30:13.198]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[00:30:13.518 --> 00:30:15.820]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.621]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called Novo.
[00:30:18.862 --> 00:30:27.027]  Novo eliminates the bacterial growth, which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration, which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[00:30:27.207 --> 00:30:31.390]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in Novo.
[00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:37.932]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and geranium.
[00:30:38.112 --> 00:30:42.274]  No-BO's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin.
[00:30:42.434 --> 00:30:46.795]  You can use No-BO under your arms, on tough foot odors, or for athlete's foot.
[00:30:46.975 --> 00:30:50.937]  No-BO is guaranteed 100% or receive a full refund.
[00:30:51.277 --> 00:30:53.818]  Visit No-BO.com to order.
[00:30:53.958 --> 00:30:56.759]  That's No-BO.com or call 850-723-8599.
[00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:04.201]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:31:04.602 --> 00:31:10.084]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:31:10.664 --> 00:31:11.164]  That's right.
[00:31:11.464 --> 00:31:13.765]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:31:14.325 --> 00:31:21.228]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:31:21.798 --> 00:31:29.507]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:31:29.948 --> 00:31:34.734]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:31:35.407 --> 00:31:40.430]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.353]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:31:45.733 --> 00:31:45.993]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:31:46.013 --> 00:31:47.934]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:31:48.014 --> 00:31:48.314]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:31:48.614 --> 00:31:48.875]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:32:01.363 --> 00:32:05.410]  People who use Cartabite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:09.036]  For over five years, Cartabite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:09.216 --> 00:32:12.702]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cartabite.
[00:32:12.941 --> 00:32:16.184]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:16.204 --> 00:32:21.689]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[00:32:21.729 --> 00:32:26.994]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal form it's like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[00:32:27.174 --> 00:32:31.358]  Now, going for regular jogs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:32:31.478 --> 00:32:32.859]  It's a well thought out formula.
[00:32:32.879 --> 00:32:38.264]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:32:38.641 --> 00:32:44.648]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems, it'll work on other problems as well.
[00:32:44.808 --> 00:32:48.292]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:32:48.332 --> 00:32:49.273]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:04.980]  Don't worry.
[00:33:05.441 --> 00:33:06.962]  This show is documented.
[00:33:07.482 --> 00:33:10.224]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.644 --> 00:33:14.146]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:14.607 --> 00:33:18.690]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:22.912]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[00:33:22.992 --> 00:33:26.515]  Welcome to the Johnny Cash Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:27.515 --> 00:33:29.577]  I'm Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[00:33:30.958 --> 00:33:34.080]  It is now officially snowing in Austin, Texas.
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.561]  20 some degrees.
[00:33:37.202 --> 00:33:45.368]  Here deep in the south central Texas, the city has been paralyzed for days with a little bit of ice on the road and some snow.
[00:33:46.497 --> 00:33:47.878]  I think we should call FEMA.
[00:33:48.118 --> 00:33:50.779]  I'm going to need them to come and sweep off my driveway.
[00:33:50.839 --> 00:33:55.682]  Maybe give me an umbrella when I go to my mailbox and tell me where the FEMA camp is.
[00:33:55.722 --> 00:33:56.863]  I need to go right now.
[00:33:57.343 --> 00:34:01.925]  I'm scared that the snow might trap me here and I won't know what to do.
[00:34:01.985 --> 00:34:03.306]  I need the government to help me.
[00:34:03.326 --> 00:34:07.668]  As soon as I get off the air today, I'm going to call FEMA and have them come sweep out my driveway.
[00:34:07.688 --> 00:34:08.609]  I could slip and fall.
[00:34:09.749 --> 00:34:10.750]  I need the government's help.
[00:34:11.434 --> 00:34:21.499]  To deal with this problem, but people here in the South don't really know how to deal with this kind of weather, and it's been, I think, very costly on a lot of levels.
[00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:27.923]  Thus, I am doing the program from the Deadline Live studios instead of the Infowar studios today, not taking a chance.
[00:34:27.983 --> 00:34:33.886]  Not that I can't make it there, and I can't drive there, but that other people won't be able to drive and will crash into me.
[00:34:34.386 --> 00:34:38.028]  And of course I'm driving no insurance and you know the story folks.
[00:34:38.068 --> 00:34:39.568]  I'm sure many of you do the same thing.
[00:34:39.868 --> 00:34:41.749]  I want to play this clip real quick by Ron Paul.
[00:34:41.769 --> 00:34:46.071]  We talked about this yesterday but here is the actual clip which aired on C-SPAN.
[00:34:46.131 --> 00:34:47.631]  It was his testimony in Congress.
[00:34:48.112 --> 00:34:48.832]  We're going to
[00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:51.900]  Also, go to your calls directly after this at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.543]  Andrew, Wayne, and Joe, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:58.603 --> 00:35:06.426]  This is the Alex Jones Show, and this is your next president, Ron Paul, addressing Congress regarding Iran.
[00:35:08.227 --> 00:35:15.050]  Our inability to adapt to the tactics of fourth generation warfare compounds our military failure.
[00:35:16.405 --> 00:35:23.229]  Unless we understand this, even doubling our troops strength will not solve the problems created by our occupation.
[00:35:24.149 --> 00:35:32.714]  The talk of a troop surge and jobs program in Iraq only distracts Americans from the very real possibility of an attack on Iran.
[00:35:33.654 --> 00:35:38.617]  Our growing naval presence in the region and our harsh rhetoric toward Iran are unsettling.
[00:35:39.466 --> 00:35:47.130]  Securing the Horn of Africa and sending Ethiopian troops into Somalia do not bode well for world peace.
[00:35:47.751 --> 00:35:51.833]  Yet these developments are almost totally ignored by Congress.
[00:35:53.634 --> 00:35:59.817]  Rumors are flying about when, not if, Iran will be bombed by either Israel or the United States.
[00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:02.479]  Possibly with nuclear weapons.
[00:36:03.431 --> 00:36:10.495]  Our CIA says Iran is 10 years away from producing a nuclear bomb and has no delivery system.
[00:36:10.915 --> 00:36:16.299]  But this does not impede our plans to keep everything on the table when dealing with Iran.
[00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:22.462]  We should remember that Iran, like Iraq, is a third world nation without a significant military.
[00:36:23.163 --> 00:36:30.747]  Nothing in history hints that she is likely to invade a neighboring country, let alone do anything to America or Israel.
[00:36:31.636 --> 00:36:40.604]  I'm concerned, however, that a contrived Gulf of Punkin-type incident may well occur to gain popular support for an attack on Iran.
[00:36:41.424 --> 00:36:44.887]  Even if such an attack is carried out by Israel over U.S.
[00:36:44.967 --> 00:36:52.794]  objections, we will be politically and morally culpable since we provided the weapons and the dollars to make it possible.
[00:36:53.594 --> 00:36:56.637]  Mr. Speaker, let's hope I'm wrong about this one.
[00:36:59.167 --> 00:37:06.430]  Let's hope he's wrong about that, and that wasn't the best clip, of course, playing that off the internet, but a lot of the noise I think you heard was chatter.
[00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:15.333]  That is the fellow Congressional members talking, not listening to this most important speech, but obviously Ron Paul gets it.
[00:37:16.153 --> 00:37:20.615]  And obviously, by putting that on the record, other people in Congress have a chance to get it.
[00:37:20.635 --> 00:37:23.656]  If they'd only listened to Ron Paul and not AIPAC,
[00:37:25.129 --> 00:37:28.191]  I think we'd have a chance to fend this off.
[00:37:28.231 --> 00:37:32.093]  It is really a dire situation and I don't mean to make light of it.
[00:37:32.153 --> 00:37:34.094]  You hear me maybe chuckling.
[00:37:34.134 --> 00:37:37.736]  It's a nervous chuckle because I know exactly what this means.
[00:37:37.796 --> 00:37:43.179]  It is World War III if this kicks off and there's a short window left to make this happen.
[00:37:43.559 --> 00:37:47.201]  Everything seems to be getting into place but we've been saying this for years.
[00:37:47.862 --> 00:37:48.082]  I think
[00:37:49.144 --> 00:37:53.105]  I think the neocons are a little bit apprehensive about trying to get away with this one.
[00:37:53.125 --> 00:37:55.426]  They might be biting off more than they can chew, and they know it.
[00:37:55.446 --> 00:37:58.527]  But if they can get away with it, we know that they will.
[00:37:58.547 --> 00:37:58.867]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:37:58.947 --> 00:38:01.848]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:38:01.888 --> 00:38:04.349]  Let's go to Andrew in Australia.
[00:38:04.749 --> 00:38:05.889]  Andrew, thank you for calling in.
[00:38:05.909 --> 00:38:06.510]  You're on the air.
[00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:08.770]  Yes, good day, Jack.
[00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:09.931]  How are you doing?
[00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:10.671]  I'm fine.
[00:38:11.791 --> 00:38:12.572]  Ah, good to hear.
[00:38:12.752 --> 00:38:13.572]  I have to call FEMA.
[00:38:13.592 --> 00:38:15.092]  There's some powdered snow on my driveway.
[00:38:15.112 --> 00:38:17.013]  I need to call FEMA and have them sweep that off for me.
[00:38:18.394 --> 00:38:19.615]  Indeed, indeed.
[00:38:20.436 --> 00:38:22.177]  I'd be calling straight away.
[00:38:23.138 --> 00:38:26.140]  Mate, it would be great to have Ron Paul as President.
[00:38:27.081 --> 00:38:28.482]  That would be a fantastic thing.
[00:38:29.583 --> 00:38:43.934]  I just wanted to let you and your viewers know that in November I worked with you too, and I managed to give four copies of Terror Storm to the band, which was quite good.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:52.845]  Just wanted to encourage all your listeners to do whatever they can to get out the message.
[00:38:55.187 --> 00:39:01.752]  Anything else you've got to say that's going on, Jack?
[00:39:02.072 --> 00:39:03.373]  Well, we have a lot to say.
[00:39:03.593 --> 00:39:05.455]  Thank you for the call, and thank you for doing that.
[00:39:05.475 --> 00:39:11.199]  Did you get a reaction from Bono on this, or U2, the band U2, on giving them Terror Storm?
[00:39:13.442 --> 00:39:19.066]  So I managed to put them out there, lay them out into their dressing room, and I didn't get a reaction, unfortunately.
[00:39:19.906 --> 00:39:22.428]  But it was at least something I could do.
[00:39:22.828 --> 00:39:29.052]  Did you get to ask Bono about his recent knighthood, or alleged knighthood, by the Queen of England?
[00:39:29.132 --> 00:39:35.736]  Which I'm sure is outrageous to people now still in Irish prisons in the north of Ireland.
[00:39:36.356 --> 00:39:37.937]  Well, that's a big worry, isn't it?
[00:39:37.997 --> 00:39:40.639]  I mean, that was one of the reasons for calling in.
[00:39:40.699 --> 00:39:41.880]  I was hoping to talk to Alex.
[00:39:43.359 --> 00:39:49.285]  The thing is, what's your take on Bono's world activism?
[00:39:49.961 --> 00:39:51.382]  I think it's all a front.
[00:39:51.762 --> 00:39:58.445]  I don't buy into what he does largely, though he does criticize the bank loans by the IMF and the World Bank.
[00:39:58.465 --> 00:40:04.128]  He doesn't go into any of the details of what you have to put up for these loans, which I wish he would do.
[00:40:04.508 --> 00:40:05.729]  I don't know why he doesn't do it.
[00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:08.510]  I'm afraid of what you're saying just there.
[00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:11.652]  You can have your Bonos and your Angelina Jolies.
[00:40:11.732 --> 00:40:15.914]  I'd rather have a couple more Andrews from Australia out there, to be honest with you.
[00:40:18.584 --> 00:40:19.184]  Thank you, Jack.
[00:40:19.324 --> 00:40:20.505]  Andrew, thanks for the call, man.
[00:40:20.545 --> 00:40:25.507]  Keep up the good work, and we appreciate all of our listeners down there in Australia who support us.
[00:40:25.527 --> 00:40:26.348]  We got your back.
[00:40:26.388 --> 00:40:27.649]  We're trying to support you as well.
[00:40:27.669 --> 00:40:31.971]  You know, I have another idea if you want to get active, and we're talking about Ron Paul.
[00:40:32.891 --> 00:40:40.755]  Call up these alleged libertarian talk show hosts with their neocon rhetoric, like Neil Bortz, and I'm saying this, not Alex Jones.
[00:40:40.775 --> 00:40:42.556]  You can tell him Jack Blood told you to call.
[00:40:43.351 --> 00:40:46.754]  And say, well, you're a Libertarian, do you support Ron Paul for President?
[00:40:46.794 --> 00:40:51.099]  How come you haven't mentioned the fact that Ron Paul is running as a Republican for President?
[00:40:51.419 --> 00:40:52.480]  And put him on the spot!
[00:40:54.001 --> 00:40:57.785]  Bill Maher and others, they are alleged Libertarians.
[00:40:57.845 --> 00:40:59.767]  Let's call their bluff!
[00:41:01.429 --> 00:41:04.392]  And make them get out the news about Ron Paul.
[00:41:04.432 --> 00:41:06.734]  If not, well, you'll get in and you'll be able to do it.
[00:41:07.955 --> 00:41:08.775]  Let's go back to the phones.
[00:41:08.795 --> 00:41:09.355]  800-259-9231.
[00:41:10.215 --> 00:41:12.276]  Wayne in Arkansas.
[00:41:12.316 --> 00:41:13.116]  Thank you for calling in.
[00:41:13.136 --> 00:41:14.176]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:41:15.056 --> 00:41:15.436]  Hello.
[00:41:15.516 --> 00:41:17.497]  Yeah, this is Wayne in Arkansas.
[00:41:19.157 --> 00:41:23.018]  I have something totally different to talk about than what y'all are talking about right now.
[00:41:23.758 --> 00:41:26.358]  It has something to do with New York.
[00:41:26.739 --> 00:41:32.780]  They're trying to take my parental rights from me, from my daughter who was living in New York, but she's not now.
[00:41:34.545 --> 00:41:35.826]  I don't know who to contact.
[00:41:35.926 --> 00:41:38.448]  I've tried to contact legal aid.
[00:41:39.929 --> 00:41:40.769]  Are you on the computer?
[00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:42.831]  I am.
[00:41:42.851 --> 00:41:45.733]  I would Google father's rights, okay?
[00:41:46.613 --> 00:41:48.915]  And you're going to find an attorney in Chicago
[00:41:50.172 --> 00:42:10.967]  uh... he's very expensive i gotta tell you this is this is really one of the worst things happening in this country and all this admit to you when i've been through this and i lost my daughter like this it was in the best interest of the trial that my daughter had nothing to do with the father ever and i was a railroad in the kangaroo court my uh...
[00:42:11.917 --> 00:42:21.825]  My father-in-law was an esteemed person in the state and the first judge had to recuse himself because he was such good friends with my daughter's family.
[00:42:25.245 --> 00:42:26.766]  So I know what you're going through.
[00:42:27.566 --> 00:42:35.610]  I would go ahead and try to find a father's rights advocacy group that would take your case pro bono, unless you have a lot of money.
[00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:39.292]  Jeffrey Levin, I think, is somebody you'd want to look for.
[00:42:39.412 --> 00:42:40.352]  Jeffrey Levin.
[00:42:40.592 --> 00:42:41.673]  L-E-V-I-N.
[00:42:41.813 --> 00:42:45.235]  And minimally, they can consult with your attorneys on the case.
[00:42:45.275 --> 00:42:48.536]  But this is a tough one, and I just wouldn't take no for an answer.
[00:42:49.757 --> 00:42:53.219]  If they rule against you, appeal and appeal and appeal again.
[00:42:53.279 --> 00:42:53.819]  Don't give up.
[00:42:54.139 --> 00:42:56.020]  I've been fighting for nine years already.
[00:42:56.901 --> 00:43:00.243]  And they don't want to give your daughter to you because you're with Al-Qaeda?
[00:43:01.984 --> 00:43:02.224]  Yeah.
[00:43:02.444 --> 00:43:02.984]  You know what I mean?
[00:43:03.004 --> 00:43:03.785]  I hear you.
[00:43:04.085 --> 00:43:05.366]  They'll find any reason.
[00:43:06.366 --> 00:43:08.628]  You know the goal is to break up the family.
[00:43:09.328 --> 00:43:11.249]  A daughter needs her father.
[00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:12.890]  A son needs his father.
[00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.452]  We need to keep families together here in this country.
[00:43:16.132 --> 00:43:20.955]  But of course the terrorists in black robes have seen to it that that doesn't happen.
[00:43:22.295 --> 00:43:24.016]  My wife is married to God.
[00:43:24.036 --> 00:43:27.638]  That's what she's told them, the DSS people up there.
[00:43:27.718 --> 00:43:31.379]  I told them that a long time ago and they wouldn't believe me.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.381]  Now they believe me because it's in their own documents.
[00:43:34.401 --> 00:43:37.102]  Well, you're going to have to get tough, Wayne.
[00:43:37.342 --> 00:43:39.763]  I'll tell you this from my own personal experience.
[00:43:40.084 --> 00:43:41.644]  Don't take off the gloves.
[00:43:41.965 --> 00:43:42.425]  I'm not.
[00:43:42.625 --> 00:43:44.286]  I will never stop fighting for my daughter.
[00:43:44.326 --> 00:43:44.826]  I love her.
[00:43:45.737 --> 00:43:46.838]  Keep up the fight, Wayne.
[00:43:46.998 --> 00:43:47.698]  I feel for you.
[00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:50.540]  Jeffrey Levin, if you can remember that.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.441]  Father's rights.
[00:43:51.481 --> 00:43:57.744]  He's out of Chicago, and I would at least get a consultation with their office and one of their attorneys and, you know, see where to go.
[00:43:57.784 --> 00:43:59.245]  But my thing is, play rough.
[00:43:59.786 --> 00:44:00.686]  Don't give up.
[00:44:00.726 --> 00:44:03.388]  Thank you, Wayne, for the call, and good luck with your case.
[00:44:03.408 --> 00:44:04.869]  Let's go to Joe in Wisconsin.
[00:44:04.909 --> 00:44:06.950]  Joe, thank you for calling in here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:07.566 --> 00:44:10.308]  Happy New Year, Jack!
[00:44:10.368 --> 00:44:13.351]  This whole Iran thing, Emanuel Goldstein strikes again!
[00:44:13.371 --> 00:44:20.216]  I sort of had a leftover 2007 prediction, and I'll tell you about my day in court tomorrow.
[00:44:20.736 --> 00:44:32.385]  But the prediction is that there's going to be a housing collapse in late July and August, and it's going to trigger the big cake sliding off of the plate, rather than just the icing off the cake.
[00:44:34.753 --> 00:44:35.974]  Well, I mean, that could be true.
[00:44:36.014 --> 00:44:38.035]  We're already seeing all the signs of that.
[00:44:38.055 --> 00:44:41.577]  In fact, housing and building, it's all down right now as we speak.
[00:44:41.597 --> 00:44:47.902]  I just saw an article today that condos in some of the biggest cities in America are almost unsellable at this point.
[00:44:47.922 --> 00:44:50.423]  So anyway, I have that for a prediction.
[00:44:51.084 --> 00:44:56.908]  Tomorrow, I'm going to have my day in court and I'm going to constitutionally challenge a policy.
[00:44:57.728 --> 00:45:06.613]  And it's going to sound exactly like the 1960s all over again, where they said, separate but equal is the excuse they used to discriminate against people.
[00:45:07.173 --> 00:45:11.116]  And nowadays, money determines your rights, not the Constitution.
[00:45:11.136 --> 00:45:12.496]  No, look at O.J.
[00:45:12.997 --> 00:45:13.457]  Oh, yeah.
[00:45:13.737 --> 00:45:19.280]  But the thing being that nobody ever said that the Constitution was repealed.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:22.382]  You still have those rights, but now everyone expects
[00:45:23.525 --> 00:45:28.062]  The more money you pay into the system, the more rights you have, and I think that's where we're going.
[00:45:29.167 --> 00:45:29.387]  No.
[00:45:30.187 --> 00:45:32.108]  You are being rated as a human.
[00:45:32.368 --> 00:45:34.748]  In fact, Dick Cheney has been searching your credit reports.
[00:45:34.788 --> 00:45:36.048]  He says it's perfectly legal.
[00:45:36.068 --> 00:45:37.989]  I don't have a credit report.
[00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:39.569]  Well, we all do.
[00:45:39.629 --> 00:45:40.409]  This is the thing.
[00:45:40.469 --> 00:45:42.410]  I mean, this is what I'm talking to you about.
[00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:51.992]  We are being documented, as you say, on what contribution we have to the oligarchy and how we're living up to the expectations of said oligarchy.
[00:45:52.032 --> 00:45:53.512]  You know, they put a price on our head.
[00:45:53.852 --> 00:45:59.536]  The minute we're born, and they feel we're worth a certain amount of money, a million, two million, three million dollars.
[00:45:59.576 --> 00:46:01.337]  This is why you have to wear your seatbelt.
[00:46:02.237 --> 00:46:05.319]  They're not trying to protect you, they're trying to protect their investment, which is you!
[00:46:05.339 --> 00:46:16.546]  The 14th Amendment says that we have to pay in, that we are subsidiaries of this USA corporation incorporated in Maryland or something.
[00:46:16.566 --> 00:46:21.649]  But I do know that in order to challenge a law or a policy, you have to get it into the court system.
[00:46:22.321 --> 00:46:23.521]  And I feel for Wayne, too.
[00:46:24.142 --> 00:46:26.642]  My advice for him is never give up.
[00:46:26.802 --> 00:46:33.964]  They're going to want to make you so disgusted and so trodden that you just want to give up.
[00:46:33.984 --> 00:46:38.986]  These cases can take years, and it's in the best interest of the child not to have a father?
[00:46:39.486 --> 00:46:40.666]  These people are insane!
[00:46:40.867 --> 00:46:47.308]  Well, even the Ad Council says that children do best when they have a father involved in their life.
[00:46:47.388 --> 00:46:48.309]  Well, which is it?
[00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:51.131]  Oh, we don't need a father anymore.
[00:46:51.171 --> 00:46:53.653]  And then, on the other side of the mountain, they say, well, yeah.
[00:46:53.713 --> 00:46:55.234]  Dr. Phil is your father.
[00:46:55.254 --> 00:46:58.477]  The government is your mother and father, okay?
[00:46:58.777 --> 00:47:02.700]  The UCC code is your mother and father, as you kind of alluded to earlier.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.422]  No, but we're not going to accept that.
[00:47:05.442 --> 00:47:06.343]  That's unacceptable.
[00:47:06.403 --> 00:47:07.604]  Hey, thanks for the call, Joe.
[00:47:07.624 --> 00:47:08.525]  Good luck in your case.
[00:47:08.565 --> 00:47:09.346]  Keep us posted.
[00:47:09.726 --> 00:47:10.967]  Can we go to Robert in Texas?
[00:47:11.067 --> 00:47:12.168]  Robert, thank you for holding.
[00:47:12.208 --> 00:47:13.429]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:14.631]  Hey, hey!
[00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:15.532]  How's it going?
[00:47:15.852 --> 00:47:16.673]  It's going okay.
[00:47:16.733 --> 00:47:20.275]  I'm looking at this snow and I'm dialing FEMA as we speak here.
[00:47:20.375 --> 00:47:24.298]  Yeah, I'm actually in my car and it's snowing pretty good now.
[00:47:25.879 --> 00:47:26.580]  You gonna make it?
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.321]  Do you need some governmental assistance?
[00:47:29.542 --> 00:47:30.122]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:47:30.642 --> 00:47:31.783]  So, what do we know?
[00:47:31.823 --> 00:47:33.925]  We know that during the mid-1970s, the U.S.
[00:47:33.945 --> 00:47:38.828]  fully supported Iran's search for peaceful nuclear energy, right?
[00:47:39.946 --> 00:47:40.326]  Of course.
[00:47:41.067 --> 00:47:43.848]  Henry Kissinger, you know, we fully supported it.
[00:47:43.868 --> 00:47:55.154]  And then, of course, when we had the Islamic Revolution, all of a sudden, there's no reason for Iran to seek peaceful nuclear energy, so it must be weapons, right?
[00:47:56.235 --> 00:47:56.875]  Which we gave them.
[00:47:58.476 --> 00:47:58.816]  Right?
[00:47:59.356 --> 00:48:02.118]  But my question is this.
[00:48:02.238 --> 00:48:04.179]  Well, someone posed me this question the other day.
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:11.522]  When do you predict the United States and or Israel will arm a strike against Iran?
[00:48:12.343 --> 00:48:24.547]  And my dumb answer for them was the moment before Iran sets up their Iranian oil burst.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.520]  You know what I'm talking about?
[00:48:26.701 --> 00:48:29.462]  I absolutely do, and they have, for the most part.
[00:48:29.502 --> 00:48:30.923]  They've already moved to Euros.
[00:48:30.963 --> 00:48:35.125]  I mean, this is why the rhetoric is escalating, as well as the troop deployments.
[00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:39.748]  Now, was Iraq involved in that commodity exchange?
[00:48:39.828 --> 00:48:52.895]  Iraq was moving to Euros as they were being attacked, and again, I want to refer Greg Palast's book to Armed Madhouse, and he talks about, you know, look, what did Saddam really do to tick off the West?
[00:48:53.593 --> 00:48:57.597]  And he was flooding the market with oil, and he was driving down the price.
[00:48:58.377 --> 00:49:00.760]  And this is what upset them so much, so they went in.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:04.043]  And not to get the oil so much, but to keep it in the ground.
[00:49:04.863 --> 00:49:07.926]  You can't have rogue people producing oil.
[00:49:08.006 --> 00:49:17.354]  I mean, even Hugo Chavez and Ahmadinejad now appealing to OPEC to cut production because prices have gone down, and it's hurting their economy.
[00:49:17.395 --> 00:49:18.856]  It's hurting their pocketbooks.
[00:49:20.829 --> 00:49:30.933]  In a way, I think that there might be some cohesive strategy to do this, but you see, it's not so much about getting the oil out of the ground as it is keeping the oil in the ground.
[00:49:31.913 --> 00:49:37.115]  Is that Alex Jones' main point on why the U.S.
[00:49:37.395 --> 00:49:38.395]  would want to strike the rent?
[00:49:39.135 --> 00:49:40.476]  Is it that commodity exchange?
[00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:48.704]  Well, look, this is a very complicated question, and everything has cost-benefit analysis.
[00:49:48.764 --> 00:49:53.688]  That means that there are a multitude of benefits by attacking Iran.
[00:49:53.748 --> 00:49:59.212]  Now, if we go back to 1953, to the coup on Mossadegh, it was about oil.
[00:49:59.272 --> 00:50:00.713]  It was about controlling the oil.
[00:50:00.753 --> 00:50:07.298]  And I have to say that, you know, I don't know if they're so concerned about moving to Euros and crashing the dollar.
[00:50:07.358 --> 00:50:12.002]  Dick Cheney, Warren Buffett, George Soros, all out betting against the dollar.
[00:50:12.603 --> 00:50:14.805]  So, I'm not sure if that's the primary reason.
[00:50:14.965 --> 00:50:21.149]  Obviously, when we're talking about, you know, butting heads with the New World Order here, they want control of everything.
[00:50:21.169 --> 00:50:27.653]  And if they feel they don't have control of a certain region or country, they want to break in and stop that.
[00:50:27.853 --> 00:50:36.939]  Now, of course, we're going to be told that it's to save the women and children in Iran, as we are already planning to bomb and kill millions of them.
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.801]  Because we want to save them from those evil mullahs.
[00:50:39.841 --> 00:50:41.262]  But, you know, we've done shows on this.
[00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:44.352]  The people of Iran love this country.
[00:50:44.392 --> 00:50:50.141]  The majority of people are sophisticated, they're educated, and they don't want any part of an attack.
[00:50:50.562 --> 00:50:51.243]  We'll come right back.
[00:50:51.283 --> 00:50:53.286]  More on this subject and others.
[00:50:53.467 --> 00:50:55.430]  More calls on today's program.
[00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:56.672]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:51:04.438 --> 00:51:04.898]  It's here!
[00:51:05.098 --> 00:51:09.859]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.259 --> 00:51:17.921]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.601 --> 00:51:25.642]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.043 --> 00:51:32.924]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:33.416 --> 00:51:37.459]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.262]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.743 --> 00:51:43.644]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.005 --> 00:51:47.928]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:04.596 --> 00:52:07.477]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?

[00:53:00.923 --> 00:53:08.846]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.

[00:54:02.012 --> 00:54:08.618]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:12.324 --> 00:54:15.487]  Just to go back to Robert's question, why Iran?
[00:54:15.527 --> 00:54:17.108]  I mean, that's a pretty big question.
[00:54:17.128 --> 00:54:23.072]  As I said, there are so many levels to benefit from going into Iran eventually.
[00:54:23.373 --> 00:54:34.962]  Personally, I think that it's very costly and it will be very dangerous, but of course the New World Order, the West, the Bush administration see dollar signs, profits, control of the region,
[00:54:35.868 --> 00:54:37.288]  Order out of chaos.
[00:54:37.328 --> 00:54:44.250]  Of course, Iran, as most of us know, are enemies of Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq.
[00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:55.573]  They're enemies of our friends, the Arabs, in the region of which we have extensive business relations.
[00:54:57.757 --> 00:55:07.194]  Above and beyond all this, there's the angle here that China is getting a lot of its oil from Iran, which I think scares the military-industrial complex here in
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:11.180]  Oceania, let's call it.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:18.361]  So there are a multitude of so-called benefits, and we like to ask this question, who benefits from something like this?
[00:55:18.461 --> 00:55:20.542]  And we'll see the usual players benefiting.
[00:55:20.562 --> 00:55:24.282]  There'll be reconstruction if and when the country is conquered.
[00:55:24.322 --> 00:55:28.683]  It is a third world country, and they have some sophisticated missiles and apparatus.
[00:55:28.983 --> 00:55:31.304]  But look, I mean, it's going to be a knockoff.
[00:55:31.544 --> 00:55:33.824]  Keeping the peace, of course, will be the hard part.
[00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:37.685]  It'll be a repeat of Afghanistan and Iraq if and when this happens.
[00:55:37.825 --> 00:55:39.285]  I'm not sure it's even going to happen.
[00:55:40.054 --> 00:55:44.377]  Because the risk involved in trying to pull this off is extraordinary.
[00:55:44.898 --> 00:55:48.480]  And that's something certainly that the neocons have been contemplating all this time.
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:49.861]  Yes, they have a window.
[00:55:49.881 --> 00:55:52.944]  And you better believe that this has to happen sometime in 2007.
[00:55:53.164 --> 00:55:58.708]  That window is going to shut pretty much right after that, if it hasn't already.
[00:55:59.468 --> 00:56:01.930]  But it's news, and we have to report it.
[00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:03.712]  We have time for a few more calls in this segment.
[00:56:03.932 --> 00:56:09.456]  We'll carry some of you over to the next segment, and then we'll be joined by Sal Costello of the TexasTollParty.com.
[00:56:09.476 --> 00:56:11.878]  I'm Jack Blood, again, filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:56:12.459 --> 00:56:14.440]  Let's go to David in Missouri.
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.601]  David, thank you for calling in.
[00:56:15.641 --> 00:56:16.642]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:17.203 --> 00:56:17.563]  Hey, Jack.
[00:56:17.603 --> 00:56:21.446]  I just want to start off by saying you're doing a fabulous job of filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:56:21.506 --> 00:56:22.147]  Well, thank you.
[00:56:23.088 --> 00:56:25.710]  You don't exactly sound like Sam Kennison, but, you know.
[00:56:27.255 --> 00:56:29.716]  I feel like Alex Jones sounds like Sam Kennedy sometimes.
[00:56:29.776 --> 00:56:32.516]  He does a little bit!
[00:56:32.736 --> 00:56:36.857]  The reason I'm calling is I'm really concerned about the nation's water supply.
[00:56:37.977 --> 00:56:50.680]  We heard the other day that fish are actually having a difficult time reproducing due to all the birth control that's finding its way back into fresh water due to people passing it and getting into the water supply again.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.360]  But if you think about it,
[00:56:53.442 --> 00:57:04.081]  If birth control is in the water supply, you've got a whole host of pharmaceutical chemicals that we're all drinking every time we grab a glass of water.
[00:57:04.625 --> 00:57:06.026]  And it's really concerning.
[00:57:06.106 --> 00:57:07.887]  That is, of course, if you don't filter your water.
[00:57:08.207 --> 00:57:11.269]  It is, they say, minute traces in Canada.
[00:57:11.289 --> 00:57:12.770]  I know they found Prozac.
[00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:15.591]  I mean, just about everything you can think of in a water supply.
[00:57:15.611 --> 00:57:20.694]  It's a very minute amount, but if you drink a lot of water, it certainly could add up.
[00:57:20.754 --> 00:57:26.257]  And the thing is, we just don't know what's going to happen, because there's no precedent for this.
[00:57:26.777 --> 00:57:27.298]  Right, right.
[00:57:27.378 --> 00:57:28.018]  Absolutely.
[00:57:28.078 --> 00:57:29.519]  And my wife is a diabetic.
[00:57:30.086 --> 00:57:37.253]  And whenever she went in and was tested for this, and they put her on all the diabetic medication, immediately she began gaining weight.
[00:57:37.933 --> 00:57:55.469]  Then we've gotten her off of that and onto a vegan diet, and she's able to do without all these medications and keep her blood sugar levels in check, but one of the side effects of a lot of these medications is immediate weight gain, and you know that all of us are carrying around a spare tire or two, and I think this is something that we need to think about.
[00:57:56.129 --> 00:58:01.032]  Well look, I mean, you just made a case for, you know, getting Berkey water filters and filtering your water.
[00:58:01.052 --> 00:58:02.333]  It's extremely important.
[00:58:02.353 --> 00:58:04.555]  You can't buy good water, folks.
[00:58:04.595 --> 00:58:05.936]  It's just not available anymore.
[00:58:06.256 --> 00:58:10.018]  And, you know, this actually gets into another issue, and I've talked about this a lot as well.
[00:58:10.439 --> 00:58:12.300]  And, you know, we get into who benefits.
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:15.162]  We're talking about getting into debt for these wars.
[00:58:15.222 --> 00:58:17.163]  These salesmen are selling us these wars.
[00:58:17.443 --> 00:58:22.146]  We're putting up collateral, which I believe to be our resources, which has been done all over the world.
[00:58:22.186 --> 00:58:28.030]  The chickens have come home to roost, and foreign entities own much of our water here in the United States.
[00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:28.871]  Bet you didn't know that.
[00:58:28.931 --> 00:58:29.471]  That's scary.
[00:58:29.671 --> 00:58:33.654]  We'll come right back, second hour of the Alex Jones Show, coming up right after this.
[00:58:33.894 --> 00:58:35.995]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:36.336 --> 00:58:38.557]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:38.577 --> 00:58:39.438]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:41.403 --> 00:58:46.465]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.505 --> 00:58:46.986]  Big Brother.
[00:58:47.166 --> 00:58:48.026]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:48.066 --> 00:58:49.187]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:49.207 --> 00:58:53.689]  You want answers?
[00:58:53.789 --> 00:58:55.910]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.527 --> 00:59:09.192]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.732 --> 00:59:13.817]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:22.468]  We give you answers, or at least we try to give you answers, rather than covering everything up and
[00:59:23.467 --> 00:59:28.871]  Going along with the corporate media spin, with the establishment media and the press corps.
[00:59:28.911 --> 00:59:30.892]  Of course, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:31.232 --> 00:59:33.374]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[00:59:33.434 --> 00:59:42.420]  Tomorrow, Bob Dacey will be sitting in at the end of the week, and Alex will be back, invigorated, ready to take on the new world order like never before next week.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:45.642]  Sal Costello joining us here on the program in just a few minutes.
[00:59:46.262 --> 00:59:48.223]  Great activist here in Austin, Texas.
[00:59:48.283 --> 00:59:49.444]  Big meeting tomorrow night.
[00:59:49.464 --> 00:59:51.205]  We need to get the word out for her.
[00:59:51.225 --> 00:59:51.765]  We'll go to Sal.
[00:59:51.786 --> 00:59:54.047]  I'm going to take a few of your calls here real quick in this segment.
[00:59:54.267 --> 01:00:05.153]  First, I have to tell you, all of the Alex Jones classics, all the films Alex has made, and there are too numerous to mention, are now all on DVD.
[01:00:05.874 --> 01:00:07.075]  That makes it easier for you.
[01:00:07.135 --> 01:00:10.637]  It's now complying with the new developments in technology.
[01:00:10.797 --> 01:00:12.358]  Everything is now on DVD.
[01:00:12.458 --> 01:00:14.339]  So if you've been waiting for an Alex Jones film,
[01:00:15.471 --> 01:00:17.213]  I've been waiting for it to be on DVD.
[01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:18.734]  Now is your chance.
[01:00:18.934 --> 01:00:21.976]  Also, there are great specials on packages.
[01:00:22.036 --> 01:00:26.199]  The Police State Trilogy is excellent, still very relevant today.
[01:00:26.559 --> 01:00:34.985]  Something you can really show your friends and your family, people that you know, in the know or out of the know, to get them up to speed on the growing police state.
[01:00:35.706 --> 01:00:37.867]  Info Weapons DVD combo pack.
[01:00:37.887 --> 01:00:39.649]  This includes From Freedom to Fascism,
[01:00:41.366 --> 01:00:50.849]  Uh... from Aaron Russo, and also the 9-11 Truth Out DVD special, which is a number of 9-11 films, including Loose Change 2, all on special right now.
[01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:54.051]  And the window is closing on these Christmas specials.
[01:00:54.191 --> 01:00:58.492]  PrisonPlanet.tv currently is running its New Year's special.
[01:00:59.012 --> 01:01:04.154]  It will end any day now, so it's time to go over to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com,
[01:01:04.514 --> 01:01:08.317]  Click on the icon for the link for PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:01:08.658 --> 01:01:09.619]  Sign up today.
[01:01:09.879 --> 01:01:12.641]  You get all the exclusive Alex Jones stuff, a lot of other stuff.
[01:01:12.661 --> 01:01:15.124]  You get to see his TV show that he records here in Austin.
[01:01:15.864 --> 01:01:18.266]  It's really well worth the price of admission.
[01:01:18.306 --> 01:01:19.968]  I've been a member myself for some years.
[01:01:20.248 --> 01:01:23.409]  PrisonPlanet.tv, the special is running out.
[01:01:23.469 --> 01:01:24.890]  Now is the time to jump on it.
[01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:25.890]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:29.851]  It supports this program and supports the work of Alex Jones.
[01:01:29.871 --> 01:01:33.713]  He's got a lot of projects in the hopper, folks, and really needs to get these done.
[01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:38.515]  And he will, with your support, and you'll get these great videos and great access to all this work.
[01:01:39.055 --> 01:01:40.675]  Going back to the phones, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:44.337]  We'll try to get in two or three more calls here.
[01:01:44.637 --> 01:01:47.018]  Steve in Kansas, you're on the air.
[01:01:47.058 --> 01:01:47.798]  Thank you for calling in.
[01:01:48.286 --> 01:01:49.026]  Hello, Mr. Blood.
[01:01:49.146 --> 01:01:49.627]  Great job.
[01:01:49.827 --> 01:01:50.187]  Thank you.
[01:01:51.087 --> 01:01:52.628]  Now, I was calling about yesterday.
[01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:53.368]  I tried to get in.
[01:01:53.388 --> 01:01:56.330]  A lot of people are always calling to you, Alex Jones.
[01:01:56.830 --> 01:01:57.470]  What can I do?
[01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:58.071]  What can I do?
[01:01:58.811 --> 01:01:59.932]  Well, one, get tapes.
[01:02:00.172 --> 01:02:00.552]  Put them out.
[01:02:01.412 --> 01:02:02.673]  That's the easy thing, yeah.
[01:02:02.993 --> 01:02:05.894]  I don't know how to start a website, but I do know how to type.
[01:02:06.595 --> 01:02:10.817]  I sent in... I typed up Hazleton, PA.
[01:02:11.797 --> 01:02:15.039]  Got the ordinance that they did for the immigration.
[01:02:16.784 --> 01:02:28.417]  And I typed up a pretty good letter, four pages long, and I sent it to the city council here in Olathe, and I sent it to the city commissioners.
[01:02:29.418 --> 01:02:30.519]  I'll wait for them to reply.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:33.282]  Just send these things out.
[01:02:34.025 --> 01:02:34.846]  Well, good for you.
[01:02:34.886 --> 01:02:37.150]  I mean, the thing is, this really adds up.
[01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:48.409]  So, when you think that, well, all I'm doing is, you know, writing the establishment, and it's just one letter, but if we do that a thousand times over, or hundreds of times over, I mean, you're not...
[01:02:48.948 --> 01:02:51.749]  Well, I know Sam Brownback, Dennis Moore, and Pat Roberts.
[01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:53.250]  They got my name on a rubber stamp.
[01:03:10.475 --> 01:03:11.396]  Well, good for you, man.
[01:03:11.416 --> 01:03:12.577]  This is what it's all about.
[01:03:12.637 --> 01:03:13.598]  And I like to say this.
[01:03:13.658 --> 01:03:20.486]  I mean, if we had a thousand guys like you that would work with us on any given issue, we'd come out ahead a majority of the time.
[01:03:20.566 --> 01:03:22.027]  I mean, we just don't have that.
[01:03:22.088 --> 01:03:23.689]  So, folks, do something.
[01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:24.390]  Anything.
[01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:25.872]  Find your line in the sand.
[01:03:25.892 --> 01:03:28.855]  If you're going to set up a website, don't just set up another news website.
[01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:29.836]  We've got tons of those.
[01:03:30.136 --> 01:03:32.479]  Get a specific issue website.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.086]  Like a Real ID Act, which is coming up here next year.
[01:03:36.627 --> 01:03:40.515]  Find your line in the sand, expose the information, and do it now.
[01:03:40.535 --> 01:03:42.699]  We're going to come right back with Sal Costello after this, folks.
[01:03:42.719 --> 01:03:43.060]  Stay tuned.
[01:03:56.306 --> 01:03:56.766]  It's here!
[01:03:56.986 --> 01:04:01.769]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.129 --> 01:04:09.793]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.473 --> 01:04:17.537]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.917 --> 01:04:24.741]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA scum,
[01:04:25.293 --> 01:04:29.334]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.654 --> 01:04:33.275]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.615 --> 01:04:35.556]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.876 --> 01:04:39.797]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:52.833 --> 01:04:57.935]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:04:57.995 --> 01:05:05.298]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:05:05.458 --> 01:05:16.062]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:05:16.282 --> 01:05:20.824]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:21.104 --> 01:05:26.107]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:05:26.308 --> 01:05:29.250]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:39.276]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[01:05:52.705 --> 01:05:54.426]  Shelly, you look ex... Oh, wait!
[01:05:54.546 --> 01:05:55.647]  Why did you turn that down?
[01:05:55.667 --> 01:05:58.269]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[01:05:58.669 --> 01:06:03.252]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[01:06:03.413 --> 01:06:05.854]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[01:06:06.114 --> 01:06:07.295]  I could use something like that.
[01:06:07.315 --> 01:06:09.737]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[01:06:09.877 --> 01:06:12.779]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[01:06:12.819 --> 01:06:14.620]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:16.962]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[01:06:17.355 --> 01:06:17.995]  I guess you're right.
[01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:19.035]  Why don't we try it?
[01:06:19.215 --> 01:06:21.196]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[01:06:21.636 --> 01:06:26.017]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[01:06:26.317 --> 01:06:27.677]  I know where we can get some more information.
[01:06:27.697 --> 01:06:32.418]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[01:06:32.678 --> 01:06:35.959]  The BedFan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.
[01:06:36.199 --> 01:06:39.339]  With our 30-day 100% guarantee, you risk nothing.
[01:06:39.719 --> 01:06:40.600]  Are you a hot sleeper?
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:42.080]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.580]  The BedFan is the answer.
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.101]  Visit us today at www.bedfan.com.
[01:06:47.461 --> 01:06:50.202]  That's www.bedfan.com.
[01:06:50.322 --> 01:06:52.663]  That's bed-F-A-N.com.
[01:06:54.083 --> 01:06:56.184]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.204 --> 01:06:59.605]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:04.367 --> 01:07:08.648]  Sal Costello is with the Austin Toll Party and the Texas Toll Party.
[01:07:08.748 --> 01:07:09.929]  TexasTollParty.com.
[01:07:11.267 --> 01:07:19.375]  We have been fighting here for years to try to stop these toll roads from going up, which we know are also control mechanisms.
[01:07:19.416 --> 01:07:23.400]  They're part of the NAFTA Highway or the Trans-Texas Corridor down here.
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.882]  I've worked with Sal and his people.
[01:07:25.922 --> 01:07:26.703]  They're good people.
[01:07:26.763 --> 01:07:27.864]  They just don't give up.
[01:07:27.924 --> 01:07:28.925]  They never give up.
[01:07:29.586 --> 01:07:30.947]  And they need your help now.
[01:07:30.987 --> 01:07:32.789]  They need you not to give up on this.
[01:07:32.829 --> 01:07:34.431]  They've had some victories in the past.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:42.245]  There is a major Campo vote where you'll be able to launch your public feedback tomorrow night.
[01:07:42.285 --> 01:07:43.847]  It's very important that everybody goes.
[01:07:43.887 --> 01:07:45.268]  I don't care what the roads are like.
[01:07:45.648 --> 01:07:46.749]  Put on your snowshoes.
[01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:48.190]  Call FEMA for an escort.
[01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:54.795]  Whatever it's going to take, we need as many people to show up for this event as possible or the powers that be.
[01:07:54.855 --> 01:07:56.296]  That'd be Tex.Campo.
[01:07:57.276 --> 01:08:01.898]  Rick Perry or any of these snakes will think that we just don't care about this anymore.
[01:08:01.918 --> 01:08:04.740]  They're trying to outweigh us on this issue.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:10.182]  We need a huge turnout tomorrow at the Commons Building here in Austin, Texas.
[01:08:10.202 --> 01:08:13.463]  That's the UT Pickle Research Campus, Austin, Texas.
[01:08:13.503 --> 01:08:17.785]  The address is 10100 Burnett Road, Building 137.
[01:08:19.066 --> 01:08:23.788]  Here to tell us more about that is Sal Costello from the TexasTollParty.com.
[01:08:24.088 --> 01:08:25.930]  Sal, good to have you on the program with us.
[01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:29.472]  We're trying to do whatever we can here to support you on this one.
[01:08:29.893 --> 01:08:30.453]  Thanks, Jack.
[01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:31.714]  That's fantastic.
[01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:47.787]  I'll tell folks that everybody should go and if you go to austintollparty.com right now and send a message there towards the bottom of the page, you'll get into our list and we'll let you know if that meeting is postponed because of the weather.
[01:08:49.063 --> 01:08:50.024]  And it likely might.
[01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:51.284]  I know Rick Perry.
[01:08:51.404 --> 01:08:52.825]  I just felt terrible for him.
[01:08:52.885 --> 01:08:55.165]  His big inauguration party was cancelled today.
[01:08:55.266 --> 01:08:56.686]  You felt terrible for him?
[01:08:56.746 --> 01:08:57.026]  Yes.
[01:08:57.286 --> 01:08:58.267]  I mean, the poor guy.
[01:08:58.307 --> 01:08:59.827]  He just won an election.
[01:08:59.867 --> 01:09:00.968]  He's our big leader.
[01:09:01.468 --> 01:09:02.808]  And they were going to have a barbecue.
[01:09:02.828 --> 01:09:06.770]  And they were going to have a good time rubbing elbows with their base, which is the elite.
[01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:17.853]  And now they can't do it, and there was no Martin Luther King celebrations yesterday either, but there's a possibility this weather could carry over, and you're saying, where do we go to get the last-minute instructions?
[01:09:18.113 --> 01:09:36.919]  Well, if folks go to AustinTollParty.com and send a message to basically tell your Campbell board members, if you can't go, and you know you can't go, go to AustinTollParty.com because you'll be able to send a message to all the Campbell board members with a click of one button, and if you are considering going tomorrow night,
[01:09:37.475 --> 01:09:43.641]  By sending that email, you'll go into our list, and if the meeting is postponed, we'll send an email to you to let you know.
[01:09:44.102 --> 01:09:46.364]  If it's going, though, we need people down there.
[01:09:46.404 --> 01:09:47.105]  I appreciate it.
[01:09:47.125 --> 01:09:58.376]  If you absolutely can't make it, can't get a babysitter that you can bring your children to this, if you have an excuse that is just insurmountable, you can go to austintollparty.com and
[01:09:58.856 --> 01:10:01.897]  They'll help you register your opinion.
[01:10:02.277 --> 01:10:07.878]  Basically, what we want them to do, Sal, is to vote no on the Phase 2 toll roads.
[01:10:08.558 --> 01:10:10.499]  We don't want the vote postponed.
[01:10:10.799 --> 01:10:12.720]  We want to bring it to a head right here.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.681]  We want them to vote no, and if people go down to the auditorium, they're going to get and they're going to sign up.
[01:10:17.701 --> 01:10:18.861]  You probably want to get there early.
[01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:26.703]  It does start at 6 o'clock, so if you want to try to get there a little bit early, sign up, and you'll have three minutes to address these vampires.
[01:10:27.043 --> 01:10:36.789]  That's right, and we started doing this a few years ago, and because of the pressure we put on them, phase two tolls are sort of in this precarious position.
[01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:41.652]  One of the toll roads was pulled from the plan.
[01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:43.070]  I don't know.
[01:11:03.656 --> 01:11:10.119]  And that's why we need everybody to go, because... On a scale of 1 to 10, this is a must-attend 10 event.
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.120]  Absolutely.
[01:11:12.181 --> 01:11:12.781]  Absolutely.
[01:11:13.061 --> 01:11:15.902]  And there's a lot of other strange things that are going on.
[01:11:16.483 --> 01:11:27.048]  Senator Kirk Watson, our new senator here in Central Texas, he's looking to alter the CAMPO board, even though he's never sat on the board for one day.
[01:11:27.128 --> 01:11:28.509]  Tomorrow night will be his first night.
[01:11:28.942 --> 01:11:35.225]  But he's been working behind the scenes to set himself up to be the chair of Campo.
[01:11:35.886 --> 01:11:42.269]  And he's looking to bring on unaccountable organizations to have a seat at the table.
[01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:47.892]  Alliance of Cities, which is not registered with any city, county, or our state.
[01:11:48.693 --> 01:11:51.514]  He's looking to give them three seats at the table of 18.
[01:11:51.554 --> 01:11:58.398]  And he's looking to bring the CTRMA, the toll authority,
[01:11:59.267 --> 01:12:05.273]  And to give them a seat at the table to vote on their own toll plan.
[01:12:05.293 --> 01:12:09.057]  I assume you'll be addressing this in public at this meeting tomorrow, Sal.
[01:12:09.157 --> 01:12:20.308]  Yes, and hopefully I'll have, I'm working right now on some handouts I'll have for people to let them know exactly how Kirk Watson is sort of stacking the deck for the tollers.
[01:12:20.808 --> 01:12:22.570]  One of the key things that he's looking to do
[01:12:23.837 --> 01:12:36.687]  is sort of what I think he's trying to do is basically say okay let's postpone the vote and then let's come out with plan B and here's plan B. It's no longer tolls, it's managed lanes.
[01:12:37.667 --> 01:12:40.569]  That's the Orwellian newspeak.
[01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:43.912]  They're not toll roads, they're managed lanes.
[01:12:44.272 --> 01:12:48.535]  So most the community will see, oh they're not going to do tolls anymore, they're only going to do managed lanes.
[01:12:48.916 --> 01:12:52.078]  But managed lanes is only a marketing term for tolls.
[01:12:53.274 --> 01:12:55.636]  These are tricky, slippery politicians.
[01:12:55.816 --> 01:13:02.701]  Well, you've got it here where the tolling tax-funded roads will cost a family thousands of dollars a year.
[01:13:02.861 --> 01:13:10.027]  Depending on how much you drive, obviously, if you use some of these tolls, I believe now you have an option to use the tolls or not use the tolls.
[01:13:10.067 --> 01:13:13.809]  I don't know if that's going to be how it will work out into the future.
[01:13:14.009 --> 01:13:19.794]  Well, the tollers say you have an option, but the problem is they basically take an expressway.
[01:13:20.274 --> 01:13:21.715]  That we paid for and they toll it.
[01:13:22.095 --> 01:13:27.219]  And then they say, you can drive down below with all the stoplights on the frontage roads for free.
[01:13:27.239 --> 01:13:28.060]  There's your option.
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:30.922]  And they'll make that as hard as possible.
[01:13:31.142 --> 01:13:32.022]  You can believe that.
[01:13:32.062 --> 01:13:32.343]  Sure.
[01:13:32.523 --> 01:13:32.683]  Sure.
[01:13:32.703 --> 01:13:36.526]  And they'll never fix that congestion because that way they'll force you onto the toll road.
[01:13:36.566 --> 01:13:39.147]  So it's really, there is no alternative.
[01:13:39.388 --> 01:13:46.633]  I mean, it's just like harassing people to get on an airplane with TSA because they want you to be part of the registered traveler program.
[01:13:46.693 --> 01:13:46.893]  Sure.
[01:13:47.785 --> 01:13:50.246]  Look, can we donate our time to you?
[01:13:50.286 --> 01:13:52.887]  I know that this is done in other public speaking forums.
[01:13:52.907 --> 01:13:55.768]  We get three minutes each, but do you need more time?
[01:13:55.828 --> 01:13:58.569]  And can people, I guess, give their time to you?
[01:13:59.229 --> 01:14:01.730]  Campo has not allowed people to do that in the past.
[01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:05.771]  So you've got your work cut out for you to lay this out in three minutes, Sal.
[01:14:05.811 --> 01:14:06.871]  That's why you're going to need our help.
[01:14:07.171 --> 01:14:09.592]  Well, that's exactly why I'm asking everybody to come.
[01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:14.914]  That's why we'll be handing out flyers to educate people where the tricky parts of the evening is.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.945]  So that they can basically stand up to the mic and say, look, I've had enough of this.
[01:14:19.866 --> 01:14:22.450]  Stop, you know, trying to toll roads where we pay for it.
[01:14:22.611 --> 01:14:23.993]  Stop trying to stack the deck.
[01:14:24.313 --> 01:14:26.616]  We need accountability in our government.
[01:14:26.937 --> 01:14:28.179]  And we've had enough of you bums.
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:45.854]  What it's looking like is they're going to attempt, especially if we have a big turn up there, they're going to attempt to postpone this vote hoping that you'll forget about it, you'll get too busy, you'll lose interest, and then they'll be able to just slam it through and no one's really looking.
[01:14:45.894 --> 01:14:47.516]  But, I mean, what we have to say here
[01:14:48.196 --> 01:15:01.845]  We're always told we live in this democracy, Sal, that it's the will of the people and the politicians are just these caretakers who are out there doing our bidding, so to speak, which if anybody believes that, I think we'd have to
[01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:17.832]  Well, I can't say that on the air, but you know, ultimately here, most people in Austin are against this toll road, despite the little songs and the cartoons that you see on TV or you hear on the radio, the little jingles they have for the text tag stickers.
[01:15:18.232 --> 01:15:23.176]  When you guys have gone out and hit the streets, we've found that a majority of people are against this toll road.
[01:15:23.356 --> 01:15:24.117]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:24.157 --> 01:15:29.661]  And you know, the Phase 2 tolls, when people actually find out that they're tolling roads we've already paid for,
[01:15:30.117 --> 01:15:31.598]  They're tolling our public highways.
[01:15:31.638 --> 01:15:37.703]  They're giving the right-of-way we paid for, the construction of the road we paid for, to private corporations.
[01:15:37.743 --> 01:15:42.307]  And those private companies are giving contributions to our elected officials.
[01:15:42.767 --> 01:15:43.948]  They sort of understand.
[01:15:44.008 --> 01:15:47.031]  But a lot of folks don't know this, and that's what we're out there trying to do.
[01:15:47.531 --> 01:15:49.493]  And that's why the key to winning this
[01:15:50.034 --> 01:15:53.578]  The war, and we've won a lot of battles, is to stay connected.
[01:15:53.938 --> 01:15:57.582]  And when you go to AustinTollParty.com and send that message, you stay connected with us.
[01:15:58.063 --> 01:16:05.892]  We'll do all the hard, deep research and keep you up to date with the most important things you can do to sort of keep our freeways free.
[01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:20.906]  You know, what I'm getting at, of course, is the hypocrisy that we allegedly live in this democracy, and that these guys are just doing what we want them to do, which couldn't be really further from the truth, and we see that on both the federal level and the state level, the city level, but there's another...
[01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:22.337]  We're good to go.
[01:16:43.754 --> 01:16:48.056]  But what I'm getting at here is collisions at these toll plazas.
[01:16:48.136 --> 01:16:49.397]  They're not safe.
[01:16:49.437 --> 01:16:54.339]  People are getting in a lot of accidents trying to stop with these tolls, especially now with the icy roads.
[01:16:54.399 --> 01:16:59.821]  So here we are again paying for something that is actually dangerous that the people don't even want.
[01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:01.282]  That's absolutely true.
[01:17:01.402 --> 01:17:09.886]  Associated Press did a fantastic story just some months ago that we got linked there somewhere on our site and on my blog to the right.
[01:17:11.399 --> 01:17:17.306]  That the toll plazas cause more accidents, and the toll roads are more dangerous than non-toll roads.
[01:17:17.926 --> 01:17:25.795]  But these politicians, they always, you know, whenever they just want the community to do whatever they want to do, we're doing this for safety reasons.
[01:17:26.356 --> 01:17:31.882]  Everything's for safety reasons, even though they're reaping the benefits from their contributors.
[01:17:32.941 --> 01:17:39.703]  Of course, another excuse to put toll roads up and to build these giant trans-Texas corridors and these NAFTA highways.
[01:17:39.944 --> 01:17:41.264]  We've got too many people.
[01:17:41.304 --> 01:17:42.685]  There's just too much traffic.
[01:17:42.745 --> 01:17:53.308]  Which, I guess, if you really and truly address the illegal immigration problem, we saw this when they took a big strike there on May Day, and it was easier than ever to drive on the roads.
[01:17:53.328 --> 01:17:55.549]  It was almost like living in America.
[01:17:55.789 --> 01:17:57.690]  You know, it is the strangest thing.
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:07.367]  That they, you know, the average citizen, I mean, the folks listening to your radio show and Alex's radio show, they're educated.
[01:18:07.747 --> 01:18:14.873]  But the average citizen is focused on, you know, making money, paying the bills, and when they hear safety, they go, oh, okay.
[01:18:15.353 --> 01:18:20.497]  And then when they hear, you know, we're doing these things for your own good, okay, that's fine.
[01:18:20.718 --> 01:18:26.302]  And when they hear that, hey, you know, in Texas, the population is just growing so fast,
[01:18:26.741 --> 01:18:27.782]  You know, they don't think.
[01:18:28.002 --> 01:18:32.205]  Your government loves you, but your government's like a prostitute.
[01:18:32.285 --> 01:18:35.127]  To get the love from your government, you must pay them!
[01:18:36.528 --> 01:18:37.769]  I said it, Sal, not you.
[01:18:38.189 --> 01:18:39.070]  We'll come right back.
[01:18:39.130 --> 01:18:40.611]  Another segment with Sal Costello.
[01:18:40.731 --> 01:18:43.853]  AustinTollParty.com, TexasTollParty.com.
[01:18:43.893 --> 01:18:44.453]  Big meeting.
[01:18:44.473 --> 01:18:47.436]  We'll give you the figures and facts and addresses again right after this.
[01:18:47.636 --> 01:18:48.696]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:48.736 --> 01:18:50.277]  I'm Jack Blood filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:18:50.318 --> 01:18:50.918]  Please stay tuned.
[01:18:53.405 --> 01:18:56.427]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:18:56.727 --> 01:19:01.650]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:06.272]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:06.553 --> 01:19:15.478]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:19:15.678 --> 01:19:19.300]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:24.604]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:19:24.924 --> 01:19:31.609]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:19:32.119 --> 01:19:32.780]  What about you?
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:38.785]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:19:53.852 --> 01:19:56.393]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:56.874 --> 01:20:01.536]  Did you know there's a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[01:20:01.896 --> 01:20:08.180]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.782]  38% higher than Bill Clinton's highest budget.
[01:20:12.402 --> 01:20:21.807]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:20:31.271 --> 01:20:32.071]  516-8736.

[01:20:39.855 --> 01:20:40.355]  It's free.

[01:20:53.544 --> 01:20:57.445]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:20:57.665 --> 01:21:09.927]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:21:10.347 --> 01:21:10.767]  The U.S.
[01:21:10.807 --> 01:21:16.388]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:21:16.788 --> 01:21:18.989]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:21:20.869 --> 01:21:21.929]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:21:21.949 --> 01:21:24.810]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:30.952]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:21:31.373 --> 01:21:34.714]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:21:34.794 --> 01:21:41.136]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:21:41.696 --> 01:21:45.718]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:46.018]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:46.038 --> 01:21:46.238]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.847 --> 01:21:55.668]  Come on, Bill.
[01:21:55.888 --> 01:22:01.129]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:02.950]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:05.031]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:22:05.331 --> 01:22:10.913]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:22:11.193 --> 01:22:17.495]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:22:17.835 --> 01:22:20.056]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:22:20.336 --> 01:22:23.799]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:24.460]  Whoa!
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.081]  What was that website again?
[01:22:26.161 --> 01:22:29.665]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:22:29.965 --> 01:22:31.086]  Now write this down, John.
[01:22:31.226 --> 01:22:35.590]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:36.311]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:22:36.611 --> 01:22:37.792]  I'm going there right now.
[01:22:38.232 --> 01:22:38.893]  Check, please!
[01:22:40.633 --> 01:22:42.154]  Uh, you got this one right, Bill.
[01:22:42.634 --> 01:22:43.235]  Sure, John.
[01:22:43.455 --> 01:22:47.837]  Don't forget, it's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:22:48.137 --> 01:22:49.858]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:22:49.878 --> 01:22:49.959]  Deal.
[01:23:11.712 --> 01:23:15.513]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[01:23:16.013 --> 01:23:18.093]  Say that joker to the dean.
[01:23:20.354 --> 01:23:22.414]  There's too much confusion.
[01:23:24.775 --> 01:23:27.796]  I can't get no relief.
[01:23:27.896 --> 01:23:31.957]  Business man there, drink my wine.
[01:23:32.777 --> 01:23:34.560]  Thanks for listening to the Alex Jones Show, folks.
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:36.623]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:23:36.903 --> 01:23:38.465]  My show is Deadline Live.
[01:23:38.485 --> 01:23:48.599]  I've been on the network two years, follows the Alex Jones Show, Monday through Friday, I believe on streams one and three, if you're listening off of GCMLive.com.
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:49.320]  And I should mention,
[01:23:50.141 --> 01:24:00.150]  I believe the offer is still good to get a free membership to get access to the archives and everything that GCN Live has as a trial benefit.
[01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:03.993]  So if you've been avoiding that or didn't want to pay or didn't know what you were paying for, go
[01:24:05.314 --> 01:24:07.655]  Check out the trial GCNLive.com.
[01:24:07.675 --> 01:24:14.997]  Sal, I want to play this commercial that you guys put out real quick because we're hearing the commercials from the other side all over the radio here in Austin, Texas.
[01:24:15.037 --> 01:24:16.197]  I think this is only fair.
[01:24:16.777 --> 01:24:18.058]  Fighting fire with fire.
[01:24:18.078 --> 01:24:23.099]  This is the commercial that Sal's organization made against the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:24:23.832 --> 01:24:26.473]  You love my TTC land grab.
[01:24:26.833 --> 01:24:29.473]  It turns your property into foreign profits.
[01:24:29.833 --> 01:24:35.375]  Countless hard-working Texans will be displaced for Perry's half-million acre eminent domain scheme.
[01:24:35.675 --> 01:24:40.156]  Families all across Texas are now at risk of losing their homes.
[01:24:40.496 --> 01:24:44.897]  Perry is also forcing toll booths on freeways we've already paid for.
[01:24:45.317 --> 01:24:47.398]  Stop foreign profits for private land.
[01:24:47.658 --> 01:24:48.998]  StopPerry.com.
[01:24:49.338 --> 01:24:52.519]  People for Efficient Transportation PAC is responsible for the content of this ad.
[01:24:53.402 --> 01:24:55.924]  That's not the one that I played the other day, Sal.
[01:24:55.984 --> 01:24:58.667]  I guess I messed that up, but that's still StopPerry.com.
[01:24:58.687 --> 01:25:00.268]  That's a good cause as well.
[01:25:00.468 --> 01:25:09.316]  That one people can watch at TexasTollParty.com, and the one that you played the other day is at AustinTollParty.com, and it's a new one.
[01:25:09.657 --> 01:25:10.778]  It's a new online video.
[01:25:12.324 --> 01:25:13.625]  So yeah, they're both great.
[01:25:13.685 --> 01:25:16.587]  And this raises the question, and we have to save a little bit of time here.
[01:25:16.607 --> 01:25:17.848]  I want to give out this address again.
[01:25:17.868 --> 01:25:22.171]  I want everybody to go to this vote, this Campo vote tomorrow for the Phase 2 toll roads.
[01:25:22.211 --> 01:25:25.654]  But, I mean, how are the media working with you here?
[01:25:25.714 --> 01:25:30.177]  I mean, I'm seeing all these and hearing all these ads pro-toll road.
[01:25:30.197 --> 01:25:31.958]  I'm not hearing any against.
[01:25:32.198 --> 01:25:36.882]  That really goes against the whole fair and balanced objective journalist angle.
[01:25:37.202 --> 01:25:39.224]  Well, we've actually been very fortunate.
[01:25:39.284 --> 01:25:45.949]  There have been specific reporters that have done fantastic, a fantastic job reporting.
[01:25:46.769 --> 01:25:53.294]  KXAN, we have a great reporter there, Chris Willis, he has done some fantastic things.
[01:25:53.354 --> 01:26:03.682]  We sat down a couple months ago, he asked me a whole bunch of details, he asked me for documents and proof, and he's done some fantastic reporting for us, and some of those we put on YouTube.
[01:26:06.099 --> 01:26:14.582]  So you could do some searches for Austin toll roads and you'll find a lot of these KXAN news things.
[01:26:14.642 --> 01:26:22.744]  But folks like the Statesman have not done any balance stories for many, many months.
[01:26:23.245 --> 01:26:26.766]  And they don't even print letters to the editors opposing the toll roads anymore.
[01:26:27.586 --> 01:26:29.787]  I know a lot of folks who have sent them in, including myself.
[01:26:31.194 --> 01:26:38.997]  Well, obviously it's a long list of people who aren't working with you, but thanks to the people that are helping you and are working with you.
[01:26:39.017 --> 01:26:51.381]  And if you don't live in Texas or you don't live in Austin and this isn't an issue for you, it will be an issue into the future because where Texas goes, usually the rest of the country goes, and we've already seen New Jersey go for this a long, long time ago.
[01:26:51.761 --> 01:26:54.522]  So you need to form your own state toll party.
[01:26:54.923 --> 01:26:58.824]  I'm sure Sal would be happy to work with you and these guys would be happy to work with you to figure that out.
[01:26:59.124 --> 01:27:00.725]  But we need you down tomorrow.
[01:27:00.745 --> 01:27:06.188]  We need warm bodies to counteract this Campo vote.
[01:27:06.208 --> 01:27:08.829]  We want them to vote no on Phase 2 tolls.
[01:27:09.149 --> 01:27:10.350]  Get up and say your piece.
[01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:12.851]  You don't have to be tremendously articulate or glib.
[01:27:13.291 --> 01:27:14.451]  Or even have a lot of the facts.
[01:27:14.491 --> 01:27:18.032]  Sometimes the most emotional speeches are the best ones.
[01:27:18.133 --> 01:27:19.353]  So everybody should sign up.
[01:27:19.413 --> 01:27:20.373]  Everybody should try to talk.
[01:27:20.673 --> 01:27:26.115]  Let's make them sit there and listen to the people, to all of us, regarding this vote coming up.
[01:27:26.155 --> 01:27:27.155]  So where do you go?
[01:27:27.215 --> 01:27:27.975]  It's tomorrow.
[01:27:28.276 --> 01:27:36.338]  Starts at 6 o'clock, January 17th, at the Commons Building, UT Pickle Research Campus, Austin, Texas.
[01:27:36.378 --> 01:27:38.479]  The address is 10-100, that's 1-0-1-0-0, Burnett Road,
[01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:51.236]  Building 137, and if you have any questions on this and you're online, you can simply go to austintollparty.com or texastollparty.com.
[01:27:51.256 --> 01:27:58.542]  And if you can't make it, Sal, they can fill out something to where they can register their complaint to the proper authorities.
[01:27:59.123 --> 01:27:59.543]  That's right.
[01:27:59.623 --> 01:28:02.285]  At the website, austintollparty.com, that's correct.
[01:28:02.846 --> 01:28:06.328]  And Jack, you did some great research.
[01:28:08.823 --> 01:28:10.424]  Coming out, was it ten months ago, maybe?
[01:28:10.644 --> 01:28:19.431]  We found out that the same problems they were having up with the Big Dig we're having here and that they're not building these freeways, these toll booths up to code.
[01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:23.093]  That was from a whistleblower, an inspector on these roads.
[01:28:23.213 --> 01:28:23.594]  That's right.
[01:28:23.634 --> 01:28:26.556]  Well, I have an update for you, Jack, that I need to tell you.
[01:28:26.576 --> 01:28:31.519]  Well, let me hold you for a minute or two on the other side and we'll get that update and we'll wrap this up.
[01:28:31.799 --> 01:28:32.800]  Sal Costello with us.
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:34.021]  TexasTollParty.com.
[01:28:34.041 --> 01:28:35.382]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:35.782 --> 01:28:36.883]  Infowars.com.
[01:28:36.903 --> 01:28:37.904]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:28:37.924 --> 01:28:38.304]  Stay tuned.
[01:28:43.593 --> 01:28:46.579]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:50.185]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.427 --> 01:28:59.569]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:28:59.789 --> 01:29:01.550]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:08.092]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:08.393 --> 01:29:14.515]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.755 --> 01:29:20.778]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:29:21.078 --> 01:29:27.483]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:29:27.643 --> 01:29:31.166]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:29:31.486 --> 01:29:35.189]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:29:35.369 --> 01:29:37.911]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:29:38.031 --> 01:29:39.092]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:39.372 --> 01:29:39.833]  It's a fact.
[01:29:39.873 --> 01:29:43.317]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:29:58.713 --> 01:30:03.917]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:30:04.197 --> 01:30:07.399]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[01:30:07.659 --> 01:30:14.804]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:30:15.124 --> 01:30:22.328]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:30:22.769 --> 01:30:24.550]  We also do credit restoration.
[01:30:25.050 --> 01:30:31.374]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[01:30:31.594 --> 01:30:35.396]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[01:30:35.716 --> 01:30:38.297]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.
[01:30:38.337 --> 01:30:39.178]  to 5 p.m.
[01:30:39.218 --> 01:30:40.719]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[01:30:40.779 --> 01:30:42.219]  That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert.
[01:30:42.259 --> 01:30:45.241]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:30:53.066 --> 01:30:55.430]  Attention, attention everyone!
[01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:58.015]  A brand new invention just released.
[01:30:58.075 --> 01:31:02.764]  It's called Wristease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[01:31:03.445 --> 01:31:10.249]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[01:31:10.789 --> 01:31:23.657]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[01:31:24.117 --> 01:31:28.099]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:32.542]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and
[01:31:33.122 --> 01:31:38.625]  Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[01:31:39.006 --> 01:31:42.027]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[01:31:42.408 --> 01:31:43.648]  That's Wristease.
[01:31:44.068 --> 01:31:49.011]  W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E Wristease.com.
[01:31:49.191 --> 01:31:51.032]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[01:32:04.710 --> 01:32:08.133]  The great Bob Zimmerman, aka Bob Dylan.
[01:32:34.997 --> 01:32:36.357]  Thank you for joining us today, folks.
[01:32:36.397 --> 01:32:39.138]  You are listening to the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:32:39.218 --> 01:32:41.339]  I'm Jack Blood, filling in for Alex Jones today.
[01:32:41.359 --> 01:32:42.920]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:49.002]  Sal Costello, our guest from TexasTollParty.com, AustinTollParty.com.
[01:32:49.022 --> 01:32:51.022]  Again, a huge meeting tomorrow.
[01:32:51.282 --> 01:32:54.023]  We need everybody to drop what they're doing and come down to this.
[01:32:54.063 --> 01:32:58.565]  We really need to have a show of force here to let these
[01:32:59.401 --> 01:33:07.925]  Again, I like to call them vampires because they are really sucking off the real wealth here in this city and in this state and in our country at large.
[01:33:08.526 --> 01:33:11.127]  We need to let them know where we stand.
[01:33:11.527 --> 01:33:12.848]  So, very important.
[01:33:13.048 --> 01:33:14.308]  We'll give out the address one more time.
[01:33:14.328 --> 01:33:17.330]  We'll also plug it again tomorrow just to make sure you get there.
[01:33:17.370 --> 01:33:25.614]  Sal, you said you had some new development regarding some of the research that I had done a while back with some of the whistleblowers working on the toll roads.
[01:33:25.954 --> 01:33:33.725]  Oh, yeah, I did, and I'm sorry, I guess I didn't finish my sentence, but it's kind of confidential, so I want to talk with you when you're done with your show.
[01:33:33.926 --> 01:33:34.687]  I gotcha!
[01:33:34.967 --> 01:33:37.371]  You'll like the news, but unfortunately I can't.
[01:33:37.856 --> 01:33:43.998]  Well, I mean, what we found, and I'll just give people the quick highlight, one of the quick highlights is the aggregate.
[01:33:44.038 --> 01:33:52.101]  This is what makes up the concrete, folks, that holds up these roads, is being substandardly used.
[01:33:52.521 --> 01:33:55.682]  This is exactly the same problem that they had in the Big Dig.
[01:33:55.722 --> 01:33:57.643]  This just came out about six months ago.
[01:33:58.183 --> 01:34:02.907]  I'm still trying to find time to write a part two to my article, Sal, because it really ties in.
[01:34:03.487 --> 01:34:05.008]  We saw what happened with the Big Dig.
[01:34:05.048 --> 01:34:11.453]  Not only did the people die, but they bilked the alleged taxpayers for billions of dollars in overcost.
[01:34:11.473 --> 01:34:18.918]  This was run by George Shultz's company, Bechtel, which is also getting a lot of these low, no-bid contracts in Iraq.
[01:34:20.119 --> 01:34:24.942]  In New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, so it's the usual suspects, but Sal, I want to hear what you have.
[01:34:25.262 --> 01:34:33.527]  I'm still putting together information so I can write a part two to this and I probably will hit on this a little bit when I show up to your meeting tomorrow night.
[01:34:33.767 --> 01:34:34.508]  Hey, talk real quick.
[01:34:34.528 --> 01:34:41.492]  I'm going to take some calls and we have to finish up with you, but do you know anything about the Road to Texas Independence Confab?
[01:34:43.092 --> 01:34:44.173]  Are you talking about the meeting?
[01:34:44.213 --> 01:34:46.154]  There's a big event on Sunday.
[01:34:46.594 --> 01:34:47.914]  Yeah, I'm supposed to speak there.
[01:34:48.014 --> 01:34:48.094]  Yes.
[01:34:48.114 --> 01:34:52.096]  It's January 21st from 1230 to 5pm at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Austin.
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:00.241]  Yes.
[01:35:00.341 --> 01:35:01.382]  So that also is part.
[01:35:01.402 --> 01:35:05.245]  I know Linda Curtis is involved in this as well as Hank Gilbert.
[01:35:05.565 --> 01:35:10.029]  They're threatening David Stahl is going to be involved in this, I guess, from CorridorWatch.org.
[01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:12.251]  Gina Parker from the Eagle Forum.
[01:35:13.092 --> 01:35:14.773]  You are going to be speaking as well.
[01:35:14.854 --> 01:35:18.417]  Annalisa Peace, who's an environmentalist, executive director of Greater
[01:35:19.377 --> 01:35:21.838]  Edwards, Aquafire, Elias, everybody!
[01:35:21.898 --> 01:35:26.419]  The point I'm trying to make, and this is just like the Tunes Not Tolls event that you guys put off, which was a huge success.
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:38.223]  Everybody getting together, maybe putting aside some of their piquant differences in order to stop these roads and bring this to the attention of the people that need to know about it.
[01:35:38.463 --> 01:35:47.306]  That's exactly right, and you know, Paul Burke, senior editor of Texas Monthly will also speak, and he's
[01:35:47.726 --> 01:35:57.855]  Obviously in the mainstream media, but it's a great example of every now and then we get somebody in the mainstream media that actually tells the story, and he's written a few articles.
[01:35:57.915 --> 01:35:58.796]  And what is he saying here?
[01:35:58.816 --> 01:36:03.079]  That TechStot is overestimating its funding, trying to tack on an extra $30 billion?
[01:36:03.419 --> 01:36:13.508]  Yeah, he was the first mainstream media to basically tell everybody that, hey, not only has TechStot lied and inflated their needs by $30 billion, but
[01:36:15.773 --> 01:36:26.858]  There's a report that, when the report came out, I found out through Paul Berka's article, where he basically said, hey look, tolls aren't needed.
[01:36:27.498 --> 01:36:31.159]  The Texas Institute for Transportation just told us that.
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:35.241]  He said it's the worst public fiasco in his lifetime.
[01:36:35.381 --> 01:36:36.362]  That's exactly right.
[01:36:36.622 --> 01:36:39.783]  So it's a pretty big name to have for
[01:36:40.787 --> 01:36:42.427]  This weekend, I think.
[01:36:42.467 --> 01:37:00.812]  But we see with this, TxDOT is doing the exact same thing with these non-compete clauses that the Carlyle Group is doing, that Bain Associates, or any of these big equity companies that are slurping up all of the resources and assets, the real wealth here in this country, and this is how they do it.
[01:37:00.852 --> 01:37:02.132]  They're getting away with it.
[01:37:02.432 --> 01:37:08.295]  Well, I'm glad to see somebody, Paul Berka in this case from Texas Monthly Magazine, is standing up to it and revealing it.
[01:37:08.335 --> 01:37:10.056]  We've got so much good information.
[01:37:10.456 --> 01:37:14.839]  We've just really got to take it to them, take the gloves off and punch them bare-fisted.
[01:37:15.179 --> 01:37:15.980]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.041]  That's what we've been doing for almost three years and we've been doing good.
[01:37:20.102 --> 01:37:22.183]  I think we've had a lot of great successes.
[01:37:22.443 --> 01:37:23.804]  We've actually removed two
[01:37:24.486 --> 01:37:28.888]  Of the elected officials who voted toll roads what he paid for here last year or so.
[01:37:29.188 --> 01:37:32.729]  Sal, I know if Alex was in town, he'd want to be to this as well.
[01:37:33.049 --> 01:37:37.571]  I'll represent him and all of our listeners as I'll be down to the event tomorrow.
[01:37:37.591 --> 01:37:41.212]  We'll throw out a couple of more plugs for you on tomorrow's program.
[01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:42.953]  Really try to rally the troops for you.
[01:37:43.273 --> 01:37:44.333]  No excuses, folks.
[01:37:44.353 --> 01:37:45.413]  We need to see you down there.
[01:37:45.474 --> 01:37:46.594]  Sal, anything else as we go?
[01:37:47.054 --> 01:37:52.399]  No, I just, when you get a moment, Jack, call me after the show because I do have some good news for you I found out this morning.
[01:37:52.559 --> 01:37:53.960]  Good, I can't wait to hear it.
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:58.084]  Sal Costello, TexasTollParty.com, AustinTollParty.com.
[01:37:58.124 --> 01:38:00.446]  Sal, thank you so much for hanging in there, man.
[01:38:00.686 --> 01:38:01.046]  Thank you.
[01:38:01.066 --> 01:38:02.487]  We've got to do something, folks.
[01:38:02.528 --> 01:38:05.270]  We can't just sit back and let them ramrod us here.
[01:38:05.530 --> 01:38:07.532]  We've got to stand up to them and do something.
[01:38:08.212 --> 01:38:14.598]  Even if, in your opinion, it's not enough, it's not the right thing to do, I mean, we've just got to do something.
[01:38:15.262 --> 01:38:20.505]  And one of the things we can do is just not give up, and that's what the Texas Toll Party has done, and all of their allies and assets.
[01:38:20.745 --> 01:38:22.726]  Just never give up.
[01:38:22.746 --> 01:38:24.247]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:38:24.627 --> 01:38:26.268]  You can talk about this or anything you want.
[01:38:26.488 --> 01:38:27.349]  Put anything on the record.
[01:38:27.369 --> 01:38:29.490]  We're going to keep the phone lines open for the rest of this hour.
[01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:30.330]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:34.372]  Lonnie has been holding.
[01:38:34.452 --> 01:38:35.433]  Is Lonnie up?
[01:38:35.473 --> 01:38:36.113]  Is that right, John?
[01:38:36.934 --> 01:38:37.514]  Yes, I am.
[01:38:37.874 --> 01:38:39.335]  Okay, Lonnie, you're in Montana?
[01:38:40.015 --> 01:38:40.436]  No, sir.
[01:38:40.476 --> 01:38:41.236]  I'm in Michigan.
[01:38:41.296 --> 01:38:41.796]  My bad.
[01:38:41.956 --> 01:38:43.017]  Okay, I brought you here.
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:46.081]  Yeah, I just want to make a comment and ask a couple questions.
[01:38:46.121 --> 01:38:49.262]  First of all, I just want to say, you know, you're doing a great job.
[01:38:49.342 --> 01:38:50.822]  Keep it up, no matter what.
[01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:56.024]  You always seem to gloom out there, but, you know, as Jesus said, his church will prevail.
[01:38:56.364 --> 01:38:57.005]  Okay.
[01:38:57.225 --> 01:39:00.446]  And I listen, I'm a regular listener, and I do buy tapes.
[01:39:00.566 --> 01:39:06.548]  I'm out trying to educate the families, and they always seem to be the hardest ones to get, you know, so I'm not giving up.
[01:39:07.148 --> 01:39:09.749]  And is it L-U-G, your last name?
[01:39:14.912 --> 01:39:16.853]  Yes.
[01:39:17.854 --> 01:39:22.177]  Now you were saying that FEMA would come and do your driveway for you?
[01:39:22.217 --> 01:39:24.359]  Yeah, I have a little dusting in my driveway.
[01:39:24.379 --> 01:39:26.700]  I need FEMA to come and sweep that out and take care of me.
[01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:30.183]  Well, would Michael Sherloff be the one to make the delivery or what?
[01:39:31.413 --> 01:39:32.194]  Whatever, man!
[01:39:33.574 --> 01:39:38.556]  I'm obviously being extremely sarcastic here, but you know, I mean, that's the thing.
[01:39:38.616 --> 01:39:45.219]  The second you have the littlest problem, you've got to call FEMA, you have to have a state of emergency, revoke the Constitution.
[01:39:45.699 --> 01:39:46.960]  They love doing this kind of thing.
[01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:51.581]  Well, I guess some of the people from Louisiana are already enjoying their camps, eh?
[01:39:52.302 --> 01:39:52.642]  Yeah.
[01:39:52.842 --> 01:39:54.022]  I think.
[01:39:54.062 --> 01:39:56.423]  They're enjoying them, quote-unquote.
[01:39:58.177 --> 01:40:08.563]  The question is the two that I want to ask, on the crime bill that they put in there, the debt crime bill, where coded colors would be used to classify people when they owe debts.
[01:40:08.723 --> 01:40:09.684]  Do you know anything about that?
[01:40:10.410 --> 01:40:11.150]  Absolutely.
[01:40:11.210 --> 01:40:28.756]  We've talked about this extensively and this of course dials into that real ID card where there's going to be a biometric, and this is the plan ultimately to have it evolve, using the card, getting used to the card, someone steals your card, you gotta get the microchip, but it has a certain rating for you as a human.
[01:40:29.316 --> 01:40:42.887]  And if you have outstanding creditors, you owe the corporations, or you've been speaking out, maybe handing out Alex Jones videotapes, I mean, whatever it might be, that will go on your alleged, your so-called permanent record.
[01:40:43.968 --> 01:40:49.893]  And they're going to rate you as a citizen to what value you have to the oligarchy.
[01:40:49.953 --> 01:40:52.775]  And if you're not a good boy and something goes on your permanent record,
[01:40:53.335 --> 01:40:58.556]  One of the things they hate the most isn't that you borrowed money and you couldn't pay it back, but you didn't borrow the money to begin with.
[01:40:58.656 --> 01:41:04.218]  That's something they really don't like, and if that's a mark against you, you're going to find it hard to do business.
[01:41:04.238 --> 01:41:08.979]  You're going to find it hard to operate and to enjoy your freedom.
[01:41:09.379 --> 01:41:10.119]  Get on a train.
[01:41:10.159 --> 01:41:10.939]  Get on a plane.
[01:41:11.439 --> 01:41:14.600]  And in fact, this has evolved into no work lists.
[01:41:15.603 --> 01:41:17.405]  This is the solution, okay?
[01:41:17.625 --> 01:41:39.786]  Lonnie, because we're told there's a massive immigration problem here, so they build camps and start raiding us as humans and create no-work lists, so that you have to be approved, just like a no-fly list, before you can get a job, before someone is allowed to hire you, and of course we see all the mistakes with the four-year-olds and Ted Kennedy being on the no-fly list, so of course they're going to be incompetent, they're going to make mistakes,
[01:41:40.046 --> 01:41:41.408]  And they're going to really put us through it.
[01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:43.290]  You just got me started on that.
[01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:44.632]  I could do a whole show on that one issue.
[01:41:44.652 --> 01:41:47.155]  Well, I think we can be thankful for NAFTA and GATT too, eh?
[01:41:47.355 --> 01:41:48.056]  Throw that in there.
[01:41:48.296 --> 01:41:50.059]  We love NAFTA and GATT.
[01:41:50.119 --> 01:41:50.840]  Yeah, really.
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:53.903]  You know, with the counteract, why couldn't we counteract what they're doing?
[01:41:53.923 --> 01:41:54.985]  There's more of us than them.
[01:41:55.465 --> 01:42:20.258]  Well, that's the thing we always have to remember, isn't it Lonnie, that the base of the pyramid, if we live in this pyramid scheme structure, and they're at the top of the pyramid, controlling the command and control, top-down, need-to-know, informationed, and assets and freedoms of the people down below, we have to remember that the base of the pyramid holds up the top of the pyramid, and as soon as we walk away and remove those bricks, they fall!
[01:42:21.317 --> 01:42:23.419]  But the fact is people are scared, Lonnie.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:24.360]  You know that.
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:25.841]  They're scared to take a chance.
[01:42:25.881 --> 01:42:27.583]  They've got something to lose.
[01:42:28.124 --> 01:42:33.809]  And I think what most of us are alluding to here is that when they have nothing to lose, we know we can count on their support.
[01:42:34.069 --> 01:42:35.711]  I'd like to not see it get that far.
[01:42:36.051 --> 01:42:38.814]  Yeah, kind of like we were scared at first before we seen the light.
[01:42:38.954 --> 01:42:42.658]  I think we've all gone through it to varying degrees.
[01:42:43.979 --> 01:42:50.366]  Pretty soon you really built up a coat of info armor, let's say, and you know you've got nothing to lose.
[01:42:50.406 --> 01:42:55.691]  And I really have, and I'm sure a lot of the listeners would sympathize with me, I've really taken myself out of the system.
[01:42:56.011 --> 01:42:57.553]  I just don't have anything to lose!
[01:42:57.995 --> 01:42:59.056]  That's what I'm working on now.
[01:42:59.076 --> 01:43:02.438]  I just got rid of my credit cards and they said, Oh, you're a great customer.
[01:43:02.478 --> 01:43:03.178]  Don't leave us.
[01:43:03.519 --> 01:43:04.619]  Well, we'll offer you this.
[01:43:04.639 --> 01:43:05.240]  We'll offer you that.
[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:07.001]  No, they make it official.
[01:43:07.081 --> 01:43:07.581]  This is it.
[01:43:07.641 --> 01:43:08.082]  Close it.
[01:43:08.202 --> 01:43:08.802]  And that's it.
[01:43:08.882 --> 01:43:09.422]  End of story.
[01:43:09.663 --> 01:43:14.646]  Yeah, if we'd have done that 20 years ago, we wouldn't be as close as we are now to all having to take the chip.
[01:43:14.726 --> 01:43:16.107]  Lonnie, I appreciate your call.
[01:43:16.127 --> 01:43:17.888]  You guys keep the faith up there in Michigan.
[01:43:18.128 --> 01:43:20.129]  Let me slam in Bill in Indiana.
[01:43:20.189 --> 01:43:21.250]  Bill, thank you for calling in.
[01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:22.431]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:22.871 --> 01:43:24.212]  Thanks for having me, Jack.
[01:43:24.272 --> 01:43:26.673]  This is the issue I wonder if you'd heard anything about.
[01:43:26.693 --> 01:43:28.153]  This was on Focus on the Family.
[01:43:28.173 --> 01:43:29.994]  Are you familiar with Dr. James Dobson?
[01:43:30.114 --> 01:43:30.514]  Of course.
[01:43:31.175 --> 01:43:32.875]  Okay, this is about Senate Bill 1.
[01:43:33.156 --> 01:43:34.816]  Have you listened to his show?
[01:43:34.896 --> 01:43:36.857]  I have it in front of me right now.
[01:43:37.017 --> 01:43:39.799]  Yeah, I have it on my list of things to talk about.
[01:43:40.419 --> 01:43:48.362]  Senate Bill 1 basically says that there can be no grassroots, quote-unquote, lobbying against our judges and our politicians.
[01:43:48.402 --> 01:43:49.803]  Do you want to add on to that?
[01:43:50.203 --> 01:43:51.844]  Actually, that just about covers it.
[01:43:51.864 --> 01:43:53.365]  This is nothing more.
[01:43:53.485 --> 01:44:06.691]  He mentioned on the Focus on the Family Show, it would subject Focus on the Family Action and other watchdog groups to miles of red tape that would critically hamper our ability to rally concerned Americans like us to make your voices heard.
[01:44:06.711 --> 01:44:08.032]  So what are you saying?
[01:44:08.152 --> 01:44:11.013]  I'm on the same side as James Dobson on an issue?
[01:44:11.093 --> 01:44:12.374]  I think hell just froze over!
[01:44:13.074 --> 01:44:13.635]  I hope so.
[01:44:13.875 --> 01:44:15.876]  That's a good place for it to be before he's over.
[01:44:16.196 --> 01:44:21.740]  But they could even face $100,000 fines for running afoul of this oppressive regulation.
[01:44:22.501 --> 01:44:31.847]  And Dr. Dobson clearly states the objective here is to hide what goes on from the public and to punish and silence those of us who would talk about what Congress is doing.
[01:44:32.808 --> 01:44:39.513]  Now what else is bad about this, and maybe you already know this, but it is on the fast track, which means they're going to vote on this
[01:44:39.973 --> 01:44:41.594]  Either tomorrow or Thursday.
[01:44:41.694 --> 01:44:46.157]  Yeah, obviously this is the first order of business, hence Senate Bill No.
[01:44:46.177 --> 01:44:46.858]  1 for the Senate.
[01:44:47.478 --> 01:44:55.143]  The House's first bill was to invoke and institute all the recommendations from the 9-11 CFR Whitewash Commission.
[01:44:56.024 --> 01:44:57.645]  So we see where these people stand, don't we Bill?
[01:44:57.945 --> 01:44:59.006]  Yes we do.
[01:44:59.186 --> 01:45:01.347]  Here's the Senators that put this together.
[01:45:01.387 --> 01:45:04.029]  Dr. Dobson had this on his show.
[01:45:04.069 --> 01:45:08.412]  It's Mitch McConnell, Trent Locke, Susan Collins,
[01:45:09.091 --> 01:45:13.234]  And Robert Bennett from Utah is the manager of this piece of legislation.
[01:45:13.934 --> 01:45:19.759]  And Dr. Dobson says what you need to do is to remove the unfair grassroots lobbying provision.
[01:45:20.099 --> 01:45:26.343]  And if you can't do that on an individual basis, because of this, the whole bill needs to be voted down and rewrote.
[01:45:26.523 --> 01:45:27.624]  It's a piece of something.
[01:45:27.664 --> 01:45:29.325]  I don't know if it's a piece of legislation.
[01:45:29.345 --> 01:45:30.926]  It's a piece of something.
[01:45:30.946 --> 01:45:32.207]  You can fill in the blank there.
[01:45:33.508 --> 01:45:35.910]  Yeah, Bill, we're on top of this.
[01:45:35.950 --> 01:45:38.352]  I'm going to be talking about it more on my program today.
[01:45:38.372 --> 01:45:40.233]  We're going to try to mobilize on this.
[01:45:40.253 --> 01:45:42.875]  There's so many things we've got to catch, but I think this is important.
[01:45:43.176 --> 01:45:46.118]  Unfortunately, this Senate Bill 1 doesn't affect AIPAC.
[01:45:47.459 --> 01:45:48.800]  Yeah, that is a shame.
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:52.703]  It doesn't affect the oil lobbies, the cigarette lobbies.
[01:45:52.783 --> 01:45:56.626]  It doesn't affect anyone except you and me, and I guess Bill Dobson.
[01:45:58.161 --> 01:45:59.262]  Hey, thanks for your call.
[01:45:59.402 --> 01:46:00.242]  I appreciate it, Bill.
[01:46:00.262 --> 01:46:01.723]  You keep the faith there in Indiana.
[01:46:02.443 --> 01:46:06.224]  Let's see, Stephanie in Texas, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:06.925 --> 01:46:07.425]  How's it going?
[01:46:07.885 --> 01:46:08.545]  It's going okay.
[01:46:09.505 --> 01:46:10.946]  I just have a comment, really.
[01:46:11.486 --> 01:46:24.251]  I'd just like to say that doing something isn't that hard, and now, during such an important time in our country, you are complicit if you sit and listen to Alex, or you, and then do nothing.
[01:46:25.523 --> 01:46:28.266]  That was the clip we played yesterday from Martin Luther King.
[01:46:28.866 --> 01:46:32.409]  Yeah, I was listening yesterday and I thought that was a really great clip.
[01:46:32.829 --> 01:46:40.955]  And I was going to say, I'm in an apartment complex and I'm just constantly bombarded by Chinese food advertisements and pizza advertisements.
[01:46:41.395 --> 01:46:42.056]  Door hangers.
[01:46:42.436 --> 01:46:45.078]  Clip door hangers, right?
[01:46:45.098 --> 01:46:50.983]  So, I thought I'm going to make a brochure with all the Real ID acts on it.
[01:46:51.796 --> 01:47:04.869]  9-11, Truce, NAFTA, Net Neutrality, Iraq, Iran, and the InfoWars website, the TexasPollParty.com website, as well as... UncoverTheNews.com, yeah, go ahead.
[01:47:04.889 --> 01:47:09.473]  Yeah, real nightmare, so I'm just going to send that out to all my fellow apartment
[01:47:10.536 --> 01:47:14.598]  We've been telling people to do this for years.
[01:47:15.279 --> 01:47:18.800]  It's an excellent idea whether you put out a flyer.
[01:47:19.261 --> 01:47:20.401]  You can make a bunch of flyers.
[01:47:20.441 --> 01:47:27.525]  You can go to a sporting event or a rock and roll event where there's a large congregation of automobiles and you can flyer all those cars.
[01:47:27.805 --> 01:47:30.767]  Here in our neighborhood we get a very dull
[01:47:31.508 --> 01:47:34.331]  Unimportant newsletter that is about two pages.
[01:47:34.371 --> 01:47:36.795]  You can make one of those, get those out to your neighbors.
[01:47:37.135 --> 01:47:38.177]  I mean, other people are doing it.
[01:47:38.217 --> 01:47:47.169]  As you say, if it's legal to put the Chinese restaurant or the pizza brochures on your door, I would assume nobody would have a problem with you putting information about the REAL ID Act on their door.
[01:47:47.970 --> 01:47:50.690]  Alright, well I appreciate it, and thank you very much.
[01:47:50.710 --> 01:47:53.291]  That's a great idea, really, Stephanie.
[01:47:53.351 --> 01:48:00.012]  I hope you do it, and I hope everybody just heard what you said, and they think about doing it in their apartment complex, condo complex, or in their neighborhood.
[01:48:00.052 --> 01:48:00.632]  Great idea.
[01:48:00.892 --> 01:48:02.072]  I want to hear ideas like that.
[01:48:02.152 --> 01:48:02.872]  J.D.
[01:48:03.173 --> 01:48:04.953]  is calling from Washington, D.C., I believe.
[01:48:05.013 --> 01:48:05.673]  Are you there, J.D.?
[01:48:06.393 --> 01:48:06.953]  Yes, I am.
[01:48:07.213 --> 01:48:08.013]  Welcome to the program.
[01:48:08.433 --> 01:48:08.813]  Thank you.
[01:48:09.434 --> 01:48:15.215]  Are you aware of the Ed and Elaine Brown in, let's see, Plainfield, New Hampshire?
[01:48:15.675 --> 01:48:15.875]  No.
[01:48:15.955 --> 01:48:17.215]  It was on the Jeff Rentz program.
[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:20.730]  Uh... the heading was a new way to go in the making.
[01:48:21.012 --> 01:48:22.740]  Oh yes, I am aware of that.
[01:48:23.191 --> 01:48:37.619]  I've not heard a word about it on the news or... Well, allegedly they're going to be raided today and there is some issue on whether they're on government property, if they own the property, if they're being leased the property, and what rights they have.
[01:48:37.639 --> 01:48:43.322]  This gets into a complex issue, I guess, of even tenants' rights or leasing rights, if that is the case.
[01:48:43.402 --> 01:48:45.624]  But what exactly... I can't remember.
[01:48:45.644 --> 01:48:46.504]  I was reading the story today.
[01:48:46.524 --> 01:48:48.445]  I read so many news stories today, I forgot.
[01:48:48.485 --> 01:48:49.866]  What exactly was the beef?
[01:48:50.612 --> 01:48:51.333]  It was taxes, wasn't it?
[01:48:51.353 --> 01:48:53.838]  What I can understand, it looks like it has to do with taxes.
[01:48:53.878 --> 01:48:54.859]  Yeah, back taxes.
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:57.644]  Yes it does, and of course we all know that's illegal.
[01:48:57.944 --> 01:49:01.370]  There's nothing that forces the American people to pay taxes.
[01:49:02.412 --> 01:49:04.113]  Are they going to stand up?
[01:49:04.253 --> 01:49:05.394]  Yes, they are.
[01:49:05.534 --> 01:49:06.774]  They're supposed to be in court today.
[01:49:06.815 --> 01:49:07.735]  They refuse to show.
[01:49:07.795 --> 01:49:10.537]  They expect the Feds to be out there armed to the teeth.
[01:49:10.597 --> 01:49:13.378]  We have to try to get any updates on that.
[01:49:13.418 --> 01:49:15.139]  You say that the story is on Jeff Rents.
[01:49:15.319 --> 01:49:17.020]  I have it somewhere here.
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:19.742]  I'll try to get it out here within the next couple of hours.
[01:49:20.462 --> 01:49:22.743]  JD, I appreciate you calling in and reminding us of that.
[01:49:23.144 --> 01:49:24.865]  Waco in the making, folks.
[01:49:24.905 --> 01:49:27.066]  We see these about once a year now, JD.
[01:49:29.065 --> 01:49:31.246]  Don't ever forget who has the power.
[01:49:31.306 --> 01:49:32.026]  It's the feds.
[01:49:32.086 --> 01:49:33.107]  It's not your state.
[01:49:33.487 --> 01:49:34.427]  It's not your city.
[01:49:35.187 --> 01:49:35.888]  It's the feds.
[01:49:35.948 --> 01:49:37.088]  They can do whatever they want.
[01:49:37.148 --> 01:49:42.970]  And we're going to be covering the Wayne Fincher story on my program today after this program as well, which is just horrendous.
[01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:44.391]  J.D., thanks for the call.
[01:49:44.431 --> 01:49:44.971]  I appreciate it.
[01:49:44.991 --> 01:49:45.771]  We're going to come right back.
[01:49:45.971 --> 01:49:48.192]  More news and information you're not supposed to know about.
[01:49:48.232 --> 01:49:48.993]  More of your calls.
[01:49:49.193 --> 01:49:50.173]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:49:56.639 --> 01:49:59.841]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.202 --> 01:50:02.143]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.503 --> 01:50:10.169]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.829 --> 01:50:17.894]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.294 --> 01:50:25.159]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:29.711]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.011 --> 01:50:33.572]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.992 --> 01:50:35.893]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.233 --> 01:50:40.154]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.194 --> 01:50:58.276]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:58.356 --> 01:51:05.658]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:05.798 --> 01:51:16.421]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:16.642 --> 01:51:21.183]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:21.463 --> 01:51:26.448]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:51:26.669 --> 01:51:29.612]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:29.832 --> 01:51:39.582]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:52:30.725 --> 01:52:31.646]  After a long day.
[01:53:15.362 --> 01:53:26.229]  Keep on rockin' in the free world
[01:53:42.836 --> 01:53:45.039]  Keep the world free so you can keep on rockin'.
[01:53:48.445 --> 01:53:49.787]  One of Neil Young's classics.
[01:53:50.428 --> 01:53:51.970]  I often sign off like that.
[01:53:52.825 --> 01:53:57.328]  Dean Lawrence Bevel of the Massachusetts School of Law will be joining us.
[01:53:57.348 --> 01:54:02.371]  They're threatening a march of unprecedented size if Congress does not stop the Iraq War.
[01:54:02.851 --> 01:54:04.952]  He's got a long history of doing this.
[01:54:04.972 --> 01:54:11.436]  He'll be joining us here in just about 10 minutes on the program today in the third hour of the Alex Jones program.
[01:54:11.656 --> 01:54:14.878]  I want to slip in a few more calls in this segment, but I do have a program note.
[01:54:14.898 --> 01:54:16.219]  Good thing I checked my email.
[01:54:17.123 --> 01:54:26.231]  Regarding Wayne's problem in Arkansas, Wayne, I hope you're still listening because I recommend maybe you look up Jeffrey Levin in Chicago for father's rights issues.
[01:54:26.531 --> 01:54:32.837]  He has written, I thought, a very good book on the subject, which I would probably recommend, but I just got an email
[01:54:33.798 --> 01:54:51.333]  From Mike in Chicago who says he worked there and does not recommend him to put it lightly he used some language I probably shouldn't use on the air But so I'm not recommending Jeffrey Levin based on one of the listeners listening to this program Thanks Mike for bringing this to our attention, but the book is
[01:54:51.833 --> 01:54:54.194]  I think it could possibly help you.
[01:54:54.214 --> 01:54:59.617]  I'm just trying to rack my brain to think of something to help Wayne, and I think I just gave him a sentiment in the wrong direction.
[01:54:59.637 --> 01:55:01.618]  So Wayne, don't go to Jeffrey Leving.
[01:55:01.678 --> 01:55:04.979]  How's that for an instant correction here on the program?
[01:55:05.039 --> 01:55:07.300]  Dylan in Texas, thank you for holding.
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:08.441]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:55:09.081 --> 01:55:09.781]  Hi, how are you doing?
[01:55:09.821 --> 01:55:10.402]  Can you hear me alright?
[01:55:10.582 --> 01:55:10.902]  I can.
[01:55:10.922 --> 01:55:11.762]  Alright.
[01:55:12.082 --> 01:55:19.706]  I was just going to ask you a couple of questions, I guess, about getting what to do if I wanted to go about trying to
[01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:20.974]  I think we're good.
[01:55:24.985 --> 01:55:26.687]  Well, thanks for bringing that up.
[01:55:26.967 --> 01:55:34.354]  I would like all of the stations already picking up this show to call Genesis and see about taking my program by satellite.
[01:55:34.374 --> 01:55:39.598]  We have a number of very brave affiliates across the country as well, and we are constantly expanding.
[01:55:39.658 --> 01:55:44.202]  So the question is, you could write me personally or write Alex personally.
[01:55:44.503 --> 01:55:51.509]  I'd like to think if I can get the program director or the general sales manager on the line from one of these mom-and-pop stations
[01:55:52.129 --> 01:55:54.873]  Uh, and just talk to them for maybe five or ten minutes.
[01:55:54.913 --> 01:55:59.618]  Being a former program director myself, I'll be able to speak their language, and I think we can do the job.
[01:55:59.638 --> 01:56:06.146]  So that your goal is to get the program directors, the sales managers, the general managers of these radio stations.
[01:56:06.166 --> 01:56:07.828]  You gotta shoot for mom and pop stations.
[01:56:07.868 --> 01:56:11.472]  They're most likely standalone stations, not giant corporate stations.
[01:56:12.132 --> 01:56:16.934]  They're most likely to pick us up, but you're more than welcome to harass one of the big syndicators as well.
[01:56:17.555 --> 01:56:23.077]  And just let them know that tons of listeners all over the world are listening to these shows.
[01:56:23.097 --> 01:56:31.721]  They're growing faster than you can shake a stick at, and they need to at least check out the option of picking these shows up on a barter basis.
[01:56:31.781 --> 01:56:32.562]  That's how we do it.
[01:56:32.842 --> 01:56:39.785]  And then you'll have them call Genesis to the affiliate people at Genesis Communications Network, or you can send your
[01:56:40.565 --> 01:56:50.408]  Well, yeah, I think it's really important.
[01:56:50.488 --> 01:57:02.412]  I mean, obviously, I know there's, you know, every day there are a lot of people waking up to this stuff, but I think, you know, obviously we always have to keep, you know, we all individually have to always remember what we can do to expand it even more.
[01:57:02.452 --> 01:57:05.914]  And I mean, I feel like one other thing I want to ask you quickly, sort of on the same
[01:57:07.392 --> 01:57:18.377]  Why is it that it seems like, you know, some places you go, you can hold, you know, ten people in a bar or whatever, and some places you'll get a good res... you know... For instance, if I go to... How about this?
[01:57:18.437 --> 01:57:19.217]  Hold on.
[01:57:19.257 --> 01:57:21.618]  We'll be back in 70 seconds for the third hour.
[01:57:21.658 --> 01:57:22.919]  I'll carry you over, Dylan.
[01:57:22.959 --> 01:57:28.101]  I'll get in George as well, and then we'll give you some commentary and go to our guest.
[01:57:28.121 --> 01:57:28.882]  Stay tuned, folks.
[01:57:28.922 --> 01:57:31.543]  The Alex Jones Show, third hour, coming up right after this.
[01:57:33.385 --> 01:57:38.007]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.047 --> 01:57:38.367]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.407 --> 01:57:38.887]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:38.987 --> 01:57:39.467]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:39.487 --> 01:57:40.028]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.056 --> 01:57:56.957]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.998 --> 01:58:01.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.801 --> 01:58:05.924]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.886 --> 01:58:08.827]  We are live.
[01:58:08.927 --> 01:58:12.210]  This is the Alex Jones Show, third hour coming up.
[01:58:12.450 --> 01:58:14.131]  I obviously am not Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.151 --> 01:58:15.672]  I mean, that would be apparent to anyone.
[01:58:15.692 --> 01:58:22.158]  I am Jack Blood, doing my very best to fill the enormous shoes of Alex Jones today, tomorrow,
[01:58:22.941 --> 01:58:35.986]  Bob Dacey sitting in at the end of the week, and then Alex coming back rejuvenated, renewed, to work with you to take on the New World Order and interview some of the biggest names out there in the news business.
[01:58:36.606 --> 01:58:43.589]  But I appreciate you hanging in there with me, you supporting me doing the program, and like I said, I'm just going to try to do the best I can.
[01:58:43.789 --> 01:58:49.631]  Just real quick, we have a guest coming up here in just about five minutes, a great activist, at least on paper,
[01:58:50.451 --> 01:59:07.321]  We'll open up a can of worms with him and see exactly where he stands, but they're threatening huge, huge groups of people to protest if indeed Congress does not pull out of this war, which is exactly what I think Americans were voting for when they put the Democrats in Congress.
[01:59:07.361 --> 01:59:08.562]  Let's go back to the phones.
[01:59:08.922 --> 01:59:10.223]  Dylan, you were asking a question.
[01:59:10.283 --> 01:59:14.586]  It sounded kind of like a long answer, but go ahead and try to ask that again.
[01:59:14.606 --> 01:59:15.907]  I'll do the best I can in the time we have.
[01:59:15.927 --> 01:59:19.309]  I actually kind of, I realized that was a long answer question.
[01:59:20.250 --> 01:59:26.933]  Well, I was going to say that I think there's obviously a direct correlation between places who have any of the radio shows on versus ones that don't.
[01:59:26.953 --> 01:59:39.419]  I was going to say, you know, why is it that some places you go, it seems like you can talk to an average, you know, you'll find three, four out of five people you can tend to, you know, have a lot more in common, whereas like at least where I'm at, I'm not trying to... So you think it has something to do with geography?
[01:59:40.231 --> 01:59:50.278]  Yeah, well, not necessarily always the geography, but I'm just saying, like, at least here in Houston, and this can apply to everyone, not just people here in Houston, but we don't, I don't think there's one show that talks about stuff like this.
[01:59:50.931 --> 02:00:01.398]  I mean, everyone here can listen to it on the internet, but there's not anywhere you can... We have an RFA affiliate out somewhere in Houston, but obviously we need more of these microtransmitters going up around the country.
[02:00:01.418 --> 02:00:04.439]  You know, I don't know if that has that much to do with it.
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:08.202]  I mean, either you're ready for this kind of information or you're not.
[02:00:09.082 --> 02:00:14.646]  I think that it's really our job to... I kind of hate this metaphor, but plant seeds.
[02:00:15.416 --> 02:00:30.666]  Because what happens is, you go and you talk to somebody, you make a good case, they may not latch on to it right away, but then something will happen, they'll hear something, it will set them off, they'll start doing their own researching, they'll find more information, and then they're in!
[02:00:31.347 --> 02:00:33.428]  So just, some people just aren't ready for it.
[02:00:33.448 --> 02:00:34.329]  Yeah.
[02:00:35.169 --> 02:00:38.592]  But I think it certainly helps to have, you know, shows like this on the dial.
[02:00:38.632 --> 02:00:41.734]  We've proved that all over the country for the last, you know, five, ten years.
[02:00:42.645 --> 02:00:43.506]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:00:43.566 --> 02:00:46.688]  I mean, I've gone through a huge transition in the last couple of months.
[02:00:46.708 --> 02:00:49.851]  Totally shook up my world, but I'm very grateful for it.
[02:00:49.871 --> 02:00:50.151]  Thank you.
[02:00:50.251 --> 02:00:51.752]  Well, Dylan, thanks for calling in.
[02:00:51.772 --> 02:00:58.578]  Hang in there, and yeah, if anybody wants to help us bring in more affiliates for these shows, we need your help, okay?
[02:00:58.898 --> 02:01:02.141]  Many hands make light work, and that's how we're going to succeed here.
[02:01:02.461 --> 02:01:04.402]  Tony in New York, thank you for calling in.
[02:01:04.442 --> 02:01:05.363]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:05.383 --> 02:01:06.024]  I've got about a minute.
[02:01:06.364 --> 02:01:07.405]  Hey Jack, what's going on?
[02:01:08.206 --> 02:01:09.207]  You're doing a great job.
[02:01:09.427 --> 02:01:12.429]  You know, it's ludicrous to me how people can't see the truth.
[02:01:13.050 --> 02:01:18.754]  They can't see what the President's doing and how this country's being set up to invade the whole Middle East.
[02:01:18.894 --> 02:01:19.635]  It's beyond me.
[02:01:20.195 --> 02:01:21.276]  Well, they have the blindfold on.
[02:01:21.376 --> 02:01:28.121]  I think people, if you look at the polls, Tony, I mean, I don't know how big of a believer I am in polls, but I think people are starting to figure it out.
[02:01:28.141 --> 02:01:30.143]  70% on MSNBC.
[02:01:30.183 --> 02:01:37.849]  You know, I think it's HR 5122 gives the President, in a time of emergency, direct control of our militia, the National Guard.
[02:01:38.866 --> 02:01:39.627]  I mean, this is lunacy!
[02:01:39.907 --> 02:01:42.168]  People can't dare to do that in Texas!
[02:01:42.288 --> 02:01:49.933]  One of the many components to all of these wars, which of course have been laid out by the Project for a New American Century back in the 90s.
[02:01:50.033 --> 02:01:52.975]  I'll tell you how far this has gone, in my opinion, Tony.
[02:01:53.235 --> 02:02:05.423]  I was watching Brit Hume last night on Fox, and one of his pundits, I forget what his name is, but he's been a hawk now for years, recanted and said, look, if I knew what I knew now, he was defending Hillary Clinton almost,
[02:02:05.743 --> 02:02:09.206]  If I knew what I knew now, I wouldn't have been for the war.
[02:02:09.486 --> 02:02:16.272]  I mean, that is a profound 180 turn from fully supporting anything that President Bush does.
[02:02:17.132 --> 02:02:21.216]  People out there, it's very easy to do like that lady was saying, make a pamphlet.
[02:02:21.316 --> 02:02:26.540]  I live in New York, I go on the subway, when I'm going to do my business, I pull out a pamphlet and here's a story about 9-11.
[02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:30.083]  You know, uh, it's very easy to do, man.
[02:02:30.123 --> 02:02:31.464]  You guys are doing a great job.
[02:02:32.262 --> 02:02:33.464]  Thanks, Tony, for your help.
[02:02:33.524 --> 02:02:34.365]  We need you, man.
[02:02:34.465 --> 02:02:35.046]  We need you.
[02:02:35.086 --> 02:02:35.707]  Step it up.
[02:02:36.187 --> 02:02:37.148]  Redouble your efforts.
[02:02:37.188 --> 02:02:40.032]  We need all the people to carry the load for those who don't.
[02:02:40.052 --> 02:02:41.774]  We'll come right back, folks, right after this.
[02:02:42.074 --> 02:02:43.696]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:02:43.736 --> 02:02:45.599]  This is the Genesis Communications Network.
[02:02:48.547 --> 02:02:51.708]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.068 --> 02:02:53.988]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.388 --> 02:03:02.050]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.710 --> 02:03:09.771]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.172 --> 02:03:17.033]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:17.546 --> 02:03:21.567]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.907 --> 02:03:25.408]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.868 --> 02:03:27.769]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.129 --> 02:03:32.050]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:05:49.978 --> 02:05:50.618]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.278 --> 02:05:52.338]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.039 --> 02:05:54.259]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.799 --> 02:05:55.639]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.379 --> 02:05:57.239]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.939 --> 02:06:01.880]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.120 --> 02:06:06.261]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.661 --> 02:06:17.263]  Jack Love sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[02:06:17.283 --> 02:06:19.023]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:20.914 --> 02:06:22.576]  Really a running theme today.
[02:06:22.616 --> 02:06:27.342]  A lot of people on the program, the guests we've been having on the show this week, are activists.
[02:06:27.462 --> 02:06:29.024]  They're out doing something.
[02:06:29.064 --> 02:06:33.530]  They're not just sitting back and griping and complaining and taking it you-know-where.
[02:06:34.230 --> 02:06:36.373]  Really getting out and trying to make a difference.
[02:06:36.413 --> 02:06:40.258]  Our next guest has a long history going back many decades.
[02:06:40.598 --> 02:06:46.643]  In taking on the establishment as it pertains to war, as it pertains to freedom and liberty here in this country.
[02:06:46.904 --> 02:06:50.907]  His name is Dean Lawrence Velville of the Massachusetts Law School.
[02:06:50.947 --> 02:06:52.869]  He's the Dean of the Massachusetts Law School.
[02:06:53.129 --> 02:06:54.130]  He joins us now.
[02:06:54.710 --> 02:06:56.592]  Dean Velville, great to have you on the program.
[02:06:57.152 --> 02:06:58.013]  Thank you very much.
[02:06:58.313 --> 02:07:00.035]  Give us a little bit of your CV.
[02:07:00.095 --> 02:07:02.237]  Tell my listeners who you are and what you've done.
[02:07:03.738 --> 02:07:07.221]  Well, I'm 67 years old, sad to say.
[02:07:08.408 --> 02:07:09.609]  I have been a lawyer.
[02:07:09.909 --> 02:07:12.212]  I've been in private practice.
[02:07:12.252 --> 02:07:13.514]  I've been a lawyer for the government.
[02:07:13.614 --> 02:07:14.455]  I've been a professor.
[02:07:15.276 --> 02:07:17.198]  I've been the dean of a law school.
[02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:25.769]  And I have had a lot of cases dealing with war, with major antitrust problems.
[02:07:26.483 --> 02:07:27.344]  I've written some books.
[02:07:27.664 --> 02:07:28.565]  I've written articles.
[02:07:29.005 --> 02:07:29.966]  You know, the usual things.
[02:07:30.346 --> 02:07:34.889]  In fact, you once sued President Nixon to try to stop the Vietnam War.
[02:07:34.930 --> 02:07:40.374]  You chastised Congressional Democratic leadership for stating that they'll not cut off funds for the U.S.
[02:07:40.434 --> 02:07:46.398]  troops, which of course means that we'll have 160,000 or so troops fighting in Iraq for years.
[02:07:46.458 --> 02:07:51.302]  I mean, it looks more like an escalation and less like a Band-Aid all the time.
[02:07:52.955 --> 02:07:56.798]  Well, I would say that I'm very much against it.
[02:07:57.899 --> 02:08:13.932]  I actually, in a blog that will be coming out today or tomorrow, have said, and I truly believe that it's immoral, as it were, for certain Democrats not to vote to cut off funds for the existing war because they are against
[02:08:14.959 --> 02:08:20.623]  Increasing funds to fund the surge or escalation, or whatever one wishes to call it.
[02:08:21.443 --> 02:08:22.484]  And they are against it.
[02:08:22.884 --> 02:08:31.329]  Obviously, they think that the existing war is already a failure, and they don't want to add to the failure by providing more funds.
[02:08:31.769 --> 02:08:35.552]  But if you think that the existing war is a failure, as they do,
[02:08:36.613 --> 02:08:52.635]  And yet you do not cut off the funds for it, then you are simply contributing to the forthcoming, you know, certain deaths and namings of how many, who knows how many thousands of Americans, and not to mention how many thousands of Iraqis.
[02:08:53.314 --> 02:09:01.499]  And you're doing it purely for political considerations because you don't wish to be tired with the white feather, so to speak.
[02:09:01.539 --> 02:09:04.520]  You don't want to be called a cotton runner, so to speak.
[02:09:05.341 --> 02:09:10.304]  You wish not to take political responsibility for doing what ought to be done.
[02:09:10.764 --> 02:09:12.525]  And that strikes me as immoral.
[02:09:12.665 --> 02:09:13.565]  Well, that's what we hear.
[02:09:13.625 --> 02:09:28.091]  I mean, I don't know, there could be something involved in this with, you know, lobbyist groups, some of the same lobbyist groups that work with the Republicans, who the Democrats are endeared to, who really don't want to see the spigot shut off for this war.
[02:09:29.771 --> 02:09:32.933]  Well, you know, I just don't know enough to comment about that.
[02:09:33.113 --> 02:09:40.695]  I do know enough to say that ever since we began an imperialist course of action in 1898,
[02:09:43.077 --> 02:09:51.203]  And there are some who will place it earlier with the annexation of Hawaii by military means de facto in 1893.
[02:09:51.783 --> 02:09:57.046]  Ever since then, it has been a good principle to follow the money, as it is said.
[02:09:57.807 --> 02:10:05.152]  And, you know, there are lots of people who are big companies who have been making a lot of money in this war, I needn't tell you.
[02:10:05.912 --> 02:10:10.035]  And I'm sure that many of these corporations give money to Democrats, too.
[02:10:10.695 --> 02:10:22.322]  At the extent to which that can be moving some of the Democrats or affecting their views on whether they will cut off funds is not something that I really feel I know much about.
[02:10:22.682 --> 02:10:25.484]  Well, I mean, obviously fear is an effective tool.
[02:10:25.564 --> 02:10:26.885]  It worked with the Patriot Act.
[02:10:26.945 --> 02:10:29.827]  It's worked now, although these last six years, Dean, and
[02:10:31.097 --> 02:10:34.279]  I think it definitely has to be a big part of the equation.
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:39.503]  How do we alleviate this fear from our wonderful Democratic-led Congress?
[02:10:39.763 --> 02:10:43.406]  Is there a way we can do this other than taking them down?
[02:10:45.087 --> 02:10:54.513]  Well, you know, you've asked what I'm increasingly coming to think is perhaps the major question of American foreign policy.
[02:10:55.574 --> 02:10:59.797]  For a number of years now, and I have been saying this for many years,
[02:11:00.758 --> 02:11:24.424]  One of the real problems with American foreign policy is that in making that policy, our leaders tend to think as lawyers do, which may be an odd thing for a lawyer to say, but lawyers are constantly thinking up the worst possible case that one can imagine and saying that we must make our policy in light of that worst possible case
[02:11:24.986 --> 02:11:30.472]  We must make it in order to avoid or overcome that worst possible case, should it happen.
[02:11:31.072 --> 02:11:35.417]  Now, most of the time in human affairs, the worst possible case doesn't happen.
[02:11:35.937 --> 02:11:41.643]  And quite often, by preparing for the worst possible case, you just make things worse rather than better.
[02:11:42.336 --> 02:11:56.467]  And fear has been a major factor in this ever since roughly 1947 or 1948 and the beginning, maybe 1946, and the beginning of the Cold War when we were afraid of Russia and what it might do.
[02:11:57.379 --> 02:12:08.886]  We in Vietnam, for example, were afraid that if we did not overcome the Communists in Vietnam, we would, in the jargon of the day, be fighting them in San Francisco.
[02:12:09.246 --> 02:12:16.570]  They would take over Cambodia, they would take over Laos, they would take over Japan, they would take over the Philippines, and that was called the Domino Theory.
[02:12:16.650 --> 02:12:18.611]  The Domino Theory is a theory of fear.
[02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:22.822]  And we're doing, we have been doing much the same thing in Iraq.
[02:12:23.342 --> 02:12:32.688]  Partly we started in reverse with a reverse domino theory, a hopeful domino theory that was in itself absurd and based on a complete lack of knowledge or history.
[02:12:32.708 --> 02:12:42.474]  And that was that we could create a democracy in Iraq and that democracy would in turn result in the creation of democracies elsewhere in the Middle East.
[02:12:43.054 --> 02:12:43.855]  That was silly.
[02:12:44.475 --> 02:13:05.650]  Today, we're again using a domino theory, but it's a domino theory of fear, that if we don't stop the enemy in Iraq, then Iran and Syria and Egypt and so forth will become more and more belligerent towards the interests of the West, more and more belligerent towards Israel, and there will just be hell to pay.
[02:13:06.241 --> 02:13:25.744]  Our basic problem, therefore, if you ask me or meet up, increasingly coming to think, as people increasingly talk about it, our basic problem is that we in this country are operating out of a culture of fear and we let it get in the way of more balanced thinking about things.
[02:13:27.152 --> 02:13:28.173]  Well, that's exactly right.
[02:13:28.213 --> 02:13:36.217]  Now, I don't know if Americans are so afraid now to get tarred and feathered as an anti-war activist or aiding the enemy.
[02:13:36.357 --> 02:13:41.079]  Obviously, this played a big part in why people didn't stand up several years ago.
[02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:49.244]  But I think you're seeing this, I'm certainly seeing this, and we're seeing this in the polls, that Americans have had enough of this.
[02:13:49.484 --> 02:13:53.766]  You know, we played a clip on our program a couple of weeks ago, about a week ago.
[02:13:54.086 --> 02:13:55.167]  Here's Oliver North.
[02:13:55.627 --> 02:13:56.368]  We're good to go.
[02:14:07.508 --> 02:14:21.293]  I mean, you know, at what point can the American people pressure Congress, pressure the Senate, to really take up their ideas, their will, their lack of fear?
[02:14:21.493 --> 02:14:26.715]  When do we inspire Congress to not be afraid, and how can we again put the pressure on them?
[02:14:27.955 --> 02:14:31.137]  Well, you know, that's the most interesting point.
[02:14:31.317 --> 02:14:32.297]  I personally think
[02:14:33.244 --> 02:14:39.688]  And I've thought this for a long time, but I think the reaction to November 7th merely serves to confirm it.
[02:14:40.949 --> 02:14:47.093]  Democracy in this country is not what most of us think a democracy or a republic should be, in my judgment.
[02:14:48.402 --> 02:14:57.427]  We have a political class which really finds one reason after another to ignore the expressed will of the people.
[02:14:58.028 --> 02:15:08.213]  And whatever one may think was the will expressed in November 7th, I think you're awfully hard-pressed to say that the expression was that we should escalate in an attempt to win.
[02:15:10.009 --> 02:15:13.771]  George Bush gets on the TV the other night and says he doesn't care.
[02:15:14.031 --> 02:15:15.172]  He doesn't listen to the people.
[02:15:15.192 --> 02:15:16.393]  He doesn't listen to Congress.
[02:15:16.413 --> 02:15:18.414]  He doesn't listen to the troops on the ground.
[02:15:18.454 --> 02:15:22.976]  He's the decider, as he likes to say, although I take some issue with that.
[02:15:23.857 --> 02:15:24.797]  He just doesn't care.
[02:15:24.837 --> 02:15:27.399]  I mean, what message does that send to the American people?
[02:15:27.419 --> 02:15:37.024]  Yes, well, you know, I'm afraid that the message we're getting is that, A, we have an executive branch which is out of control.
[02:15:37.771 --> 02:16:04.890]  B, we have a Congress which lacks the morality and intestinal fortitude to stop that executive branch, and C, this really is another step along a long train of steps that started, in reality, on June 20th or 21st, 1950, when Truman made up his mind with Hutchison that we were going to go into the Korean War without Congressional approval,
[02:16:05.652 --> 02:16:13.955]  Ed Anderson even said that this is not exactly the time to be thinking of constitutional niceties, or some phrase just like that.
[02:16:14.795 --> 02:16:25.499]  And then it continued in Vietnam, and then it continued in a whole bunch of other invasions of small countries, such as Panama, and such as Grenada.
[02:16:26.339 --> 02:16:34.541]  And the Dominican Republic and Haiti, wherever we send our troops, just as we started sending them all over hell and beyond, starting in 1898.
[02:16:34.601 --> 02:16:51.626]  And, you know, right now we do indeed, the American public, I think, are beginning to understand, at least a lot of people are beginning to understand, maybe not all, that we have an executive branch that is completely out of control and a Congress that lacks the guts to stop them.
[02:16:52.580 --> 02:16:55.384]  I tend to think that they're doing exactly what they want.
[02:16:56.205 --> 02:17:00.330]  It would seem out of control to us reasonable people out there, Dean Velville.
[02:17:01.411 --> 02:17:01.752]  I don't know.
[02:17:02.172 --> 02:17:06.477]  I think they have an agenda and a plan, and I tend to think that it's working perfectly for them.
[02:17:06.858 --> 02:17:08.260]  Is there anything to the effect?
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:09.982]  I mean, are the American people going to get
[02:17:10.775 --> 02:17:26.265]  Are they going to take enough time to understand the same people that were involved in Vietnam, whether that be KBR, or Halliburton, or Cheney, or Negroponte, or George Herbert Walker Bush, are the same people involved in Iran-Contra, the same people involved in these latest wars?
[02:17:28.046 --> 02:17:32.309]  Let me get your answer to that question on the side of this break.
[02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:34.110]  Dean Lawrence Velville with us, folks.
[02:17:34.130 --> 02:17:34.510]  Stay tuned.
[02:17:45.828 --> 02:17:51.053]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:17:51.213 --> 02:17:59.302]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:17:59.562 --> 02:18:06.609]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:18:06.749 --> 02:18:07.690]  We're good to go!
[02:18:33.831 --> 02:18:35.191]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:35.311 --> 02:18:45.854]  Did you know that the Lennon School of Political Warfare has laid down a plan for a Third World War that will destroy both Christianity and Communism at the same time?
[02:18:59.036 --> 02:19:04.541]  From the rubbles of this war, the Illuminati will establish their world government, prophesied in Revelation Chapter 13.
[02:19:05.983 --> 02:19:15.952]  Communism said they would pretend to collapse, and when America had begun to disarm, the combined communist world would launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists.
[02:19:16.761 --> 02:19:23.907]  We'd like to show you how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:44.881]  Ted Andersen from Midas.
[02:19:44.921 --> 02:19:45.302]  January 16, 2007.
[02:19:45.462 --> 02:19:45.762]  Gold 625.
[02:19:45.882 --> 02:19:46.703]  On scroll coin 645.66.
[02:19:46.743 --> 02:19:47.204]  325.38 for half.
[02:19:47.224 --> 02:19:48.125]  162.69 for quarter ounce.
[02:19:48.185 --> 02:19:48.646]  That's 645.66, 325.38, and 162.69.
[02:19:59.177 --> 02:20:00.698]  1971, Nixon closes the gold window.
[02:20:00.758 --> 02:20:01.619]  Fiat currency.
[02:20:02.399 --> 02:20:06.262]  1920s, the German market explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[02:20:06.582 --> 02:20:09.584]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[02:20:09.604 --> 02:20:12.405]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[02:20:12.425 --> 02:20:15.267]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[02:20:16.128 --> 02:20:18.889]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:24.313]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[02:20:24.473 --> 02:20:25.794]  Could government let this happen?
[02:20:25.894 --> 02:20:27.855]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[02:20:28.135 --> 02:20:35.226]  Midas has Nick Bereshoff's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[02:20:35.266 --> 02:20:37.008]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[02:20:37.068 --> 02:20:38.270]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[02:20:38.290 --> 02:20:38.571]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:20:44.244 --> 02:20:48.205]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[02:20:48.445 --> 02:20:51.966]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[02:20:52.246 --> 02:20:56.326]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[02:20:56.627 --> 02:20:57.567]  I was so amazed.
[02:20:57.787 --> 02:21:00.627]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[02:21:00.827 --> 02:21:02.708]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[02:21:03.088 --> 02:21:08.289]  Soleilwellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[02:21:08.769 --> 02:21:14.673]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[02:21:14.953 --> 02:21:16.675]  I figured it would clean really well.
[02:21:16.935 --> 02:21:20.097]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[02:21:20.297 --> 02:21:24.200]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[02:21:24.460 --> 02:21:25.921]  Plus, the service was great.
[02:21:26.281 --> 02:21:31.403]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit www.SolayWellness.com.
[02:21:31.443 --> 02:21:34.604]  That's www.SolayWellness.com.
[02:21:34.764 --> 02:21:35.244]  Or call 312-224-2710.
[02:21:35.264 --> 02:21:35.304]  312-224-2710.
[02:21:53.948 --> 02:21:57.975]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[02:22:01.121 --> 02:22:04.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:04.462 --> 02:22:09.445]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:22:27.893 --> 02:22:38.358]  In an October 2006 cover story, the National Jurist magazine named our guest today, Lawrence Velville, one of the most influential people in legal education over the past 15 years.
[02:22:39.835 --> 02:22:48.503]  Dean Velville is the editor-in-chief of a journal of serious thought published by his law school that he helped found called The Long Term View.
[02:22:48.523 --> 02:22:55.589]  He's also host of an hour-long television book review show, Books of Our Time, produced by MSL and seen throughout New England.
[02:22:55.869 --> 02:22:57.390]  He joins us on our program today.
[02:22:57.451 --> 02:23:06.919]  Dean Velville, it's so good to have you and there's so many questions I want to get to, but what about the same names being involved for the last 40 years in foreign policy?
[02:23:07.419 --> 02:23:17.946]  Headed off by, of course, Henry Kissinger, who, as we know, is consulting with George W. Bush, probably on his father's behalf or David Rockefeller's behalf, in the White House.
[02:23:18.006 --> 02:23:22.668]  I mean, the old adage is, you don't learn from history, you're doomed to repeat it.
[02:23:22.708 --> 02:23:26.491]  Having the same people institute this foreign policy is pretty boneheaded.
[02:23:27.751 --> 02:23:33.335]  Well, I cannot do anything but agree with you and say that perhaps
[02:23:34.276 --> 02:23:40.821]  Modern medicine's ability to keep people alive longer and longer is not an unalloyed good, if you see what I mean.
[02:23:41.962 --> 02:23:46.646]  Yes, people who have particular worldviews have now been around and in power.
[02:23:47.330 --> 02:23:54.754]  Since roughly 1968 or 1973, depending on how one calculates it.
[02:23:55.755 --> 02:23:58.496]  And this includes the people you have mentioned.
[02:23:58.516 --> 02:24:08.782]  And, you know, it's really tragic in this regard that Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon has come to be regarded by most people in the United States
[02:24:09.362 --> 02:24:15.484]  As a good thing that caused us to avoid the divisions and so forth.
[02:24:15.704 --> 02:24:17.465]  I think that's wholly wrong.
[02:24:17.665 --> 02:24:33.330]  I think that Pope Ford's pardon cemented a view which might have been true anyway beforehand, but he certainly cemented the view that criminals in high office and people who do very bad things in high office are not going to suffer for it.
[02:24:33.430 --> 02:24:34.791]  They are going to get away with it.
[02:24:35.352 --> 02:24:44.854]  They're going to be able to make millions of dollars afterwards as Kissinger apparently has and as Cheney did and as Rumsfeld has.
[02:24:45.913 --> 02:24:50.595]  And that's one of the reasons why these people continue to do the things that they are doing.
[02:24:51.075 --> 02:25:10.884]  They know that, A, it's not going to be their children or their grandchildren or their relatives or friends who are facing the enemy's bullets, and B, they know that, unlike these people whom the Iraqis don't even seem to be able to hang properly, that they are never going to be facing criminal punishment for what they have done.
[02:25:11.324 --> 02:25:17.585]  And so we have now, for the last 35 years or so, the same people with the same ideas doing the same kind of things.
[02:25:17.625 --> 02:25:20.666]  In fact, the more they screw up, the more they get promoted, allegedly.
[02:25:20.706 --> 02:25:28.988]  And, you know, we can talk about conflicts of interest here with James Baker III and Henry Kissinger having contracts with Saudi Arabia.
[02:25:29.028 --> 02:25:31.649]  I mean, literally working for Saudi Arabia, obviously.
[02:25:31.729 --> 02:25:33.309]  And I guess we can throw in Israel here.
[02:25:33.769 --> 02:25:35.709]  Obviously, there are some conflicts of interest.
[02:25:35.849 --> 02:25:38.190]  These are the people spearheading our foreign policy.
[02:25:39.244 --> 02:25:47.809]  Yes, and I think that the words conflict of interest are, to some extent, at least figuratively, if not literally, unknown to these people.
[02:25:48.770 --> 02:25:50.211]  They've never heard the term before.
[02:25:50.251 --> 02:25:54.793]  They didn't take an ethics class, I guess, when they were getting their New World Order education.
[02:25:55.514 --> 02:26:01.197]  We're just about to go to break again, but I know you're going to stay with us for the balance of the show, at least another half an hour.
[02:26:01.217 --> 02:26:08.602]  And I want to get into the authority the President has, of course, as a law professor, you know all about this, the authority to
[02:26:09.262 --> 02:26:10.022]  We're good to go.
[02:26:29.388 --> 02:26:31.050]  And I want to get into some of those issues.
[02:26:31.070 --> 02:26:42.560]  You mentioned, you talk about former Justice Department Counsel John Yoo, and then he says that the Commander-in-Chief has the ability to wage war no matter what Congress does.
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:46.023]  Of course, again, going back to the 60 Minutes interview with George W. Bush,
[02:26:46.383 --> 02:26:48.904]  Well, a clue would be that these people are out of their minds.
[02:27:07.786 --> 02:27:09.388]  That simplifies it.
[02:27:09.408 --> 02:27:11.289]  I think that's what Ray McGovern often says.
[02:27:11.369 --> 02:27:17.574]  These were the people once termed the crazies in the basement, folks, now running our foreign policy.
[02:27:17.734 --> 02:27:22.978]  But we're going to come back and clarify this in a legal terminology when we come back right after this, folks.
[02:27:23.018 --> 02:27:25.040]  The Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com.
[02:27:25.060 --> 02:27:25.420]  Stay tuned.
[02:27:35.908 --> 02:27:38.910]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.810 --> 02:27:42.592]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.735 --> 02:27:51.418]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:27:52.598 --> 02:27:57.421]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:27:57.621 --> 02:28:00.363]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:28:00.403 --> 02:28:01.504]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:28:02.859 --> 02:28:07.442]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:28:08.362 --> 02:28:15.646]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:28:16.647 --> 02:28:19.709]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:28:20.609 --> 02:28:25.312]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:28:26.293 --> 02:28:27.573]  Call for your copy today.
[02:28:27.613 --> 02:28:27.793]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:28:31.056 --> 02:28:36.898]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:28:37.598 --> 02:28:40.059]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:28:40.139 --> 02:28:43.680]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:28:45.501 --> 02:28:47.902]  Attention, attention everyone!
[02:28:47.982 --> 02:28:50.442]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:28:50.502 --> 02:28:55.204]  It's called Wristease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[02:28:55.885 --> 02:29:02.690]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[02:29:03.231 --> 02:29:16.100]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[02:29:16.561 --> 02:29:20.543]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[02:29:21.004 --> 02:29:24.987]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and
[02:29:25.547 --> 02:29:31.072]  Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[02:29:31.452 --> 02:29:34.474]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[02:29:34.854 --> 02:29:36.075]  That's Wristease.
[02:29:36.516 --> 02:29:41.480]  W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E Wristease.com.
[02:29:41.620 --> 02:29:43.461]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[02:29:45.396 --> 02:29:49.440]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:49.660 --> 02:29:53.063]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:53.243 --> 02:29:56.746]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:56.986 --> 02:30:00.249]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:30:00.269 --> 02:30:05.733]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[02:30:05.753 --> 02:30:10.998]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal form it's like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[02:30:11.198 --> 02:30:15.382]  Now, going for regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:30:15.502 --> 02:30:16.844]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:30:16.884 --> 02:30:22.349]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:30:22.789 --> 02:30:27.254]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:27.334 --> 02:30:28.595]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:30.899 --> 02:30:31.419]  We're good to go.
[02:31:09.666 --> 02:31:10.807]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:10.827 --> 02:31:13.368]  Jack Blood filling in for Alex today and tomorrow.
[02:31:13.468 --> 02:31:16.529]  Alex will be back next week on the program for you.
[02:31:17.890 --> 02:31:18.770]  Good guest today.
[02:31:18.810 --> 02:31:23.793]  Good job, Kevin, booking Dean Lawrence Velville of the Massachusetts School of Law with us.
[02:31:23.833 --> 02:31:28.355]  His website is velvilleonnationalaffairs.com.
[02:31:28.375 --> 02:31:36.799]  That's V-E-L, V-E-L, onnationalaffairs.com, and of course that's linked at
[02:31:37.742 --> 02:31:43.247]  Infowars.com, as well as a wonderful picture of Dean Veltel.
[02:31:43.347 --> 02:31:52.636]  Dean, let's go to the legal questions here, if we can talk about what power Congress has, what power the President has, so we can put this in the proper perspective for our listeners.
[02:31:53.857 --> 02:31:59.703]  Okay, I'll try to keep this brief, rather than give you all the chapter in detail.
[02:32:00.444 --> 02:32:02.806]  Fundamentally, when they wrote the Constitution,
[02:32:03.416 --> 02:32:13.224]  The framers of the country were very concerned that the executive would have the power to determine that there shall be war, because they had seen what disasters this led to.
[02:32:13.244 --> 02:32:23.112]  They wanted the decision on war to be made by the Congress, and that's why they created the Declaration of War Clause that says, Congress shall declare war.
[02:32:23.652 --> 02:32:30.438]  That was a way of saying that Congress shall make the determination on whether we shall fight a war and how big a war we shall fight.
[02:32:31.414 --> 02:32:41.420]  Over the course of the years, that was not honored sometimes in the breach when it came to small invasions against small countries in the 19th and 20th centuries.
[02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:52.027]  There were a lot of those, but the first really significant breach in it did not occur until Truman sent troops to Korea in 1950.
[02:32:52.987 --> 02:33:00.252]  I should say that some people like to say Lincoln breached it, but one has to remember that was a civil war which is worlds different.
[02:33:00.792 --> 02:33:13.244]  And he was consented with a war already in effect declared upon the federal government, and he immediately, and it's very important that he did so, got ratification from Congress for everything he did.
[02:33:13.735 --> 02:33:25.124]  So the first real breach was when Truman sent troops into Korea, and the thinking that began to take over then was a product of the Cold War.
[02:33:25.744 --> 02:33:32.470]  And in Vietnam, of course, that thinking reached a zenith, and the President took the position
[02:33:33.210 --> 02:33:45.454]  Uh, as you point out, George W. Bush, the first Bush leader did, that the president as commander-in-chief has the power to fight any kind of a war he wants against whomever he wants, whatever he wants, and so on and so forth.
[02:33:45.894 --> 02:33:49.936]  And as part of that, they said they did not even need the Tonkin Resolution.
[02:33:50.336 --> 02:33:55.898]  They began saying that after people became aware that the Tonkin Resolution was in effect a fraud.
[02:33:56.098 --> 02:33:56.238]  Yeah.
[02:33:56.798 --> 02:34:03.821]  Now, that kind of thinking that started developing in the Cold War has continued on through our own day.
[02:34:04.561 --> 02:34:15.186]  And now, in those in the Vietnam War, there were lots of false reasons given for why the President allegedly can fight any kind of war he wants against whomever he wants.
[02:34:15.666 --> 02:34:19.888]  But these days, it has come down to fundamentally one proposition only.
[02:34:20.268 --> 02:34:24.970]  That as Commander-in-Chief, he need not obey the laws of Congress.
[02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:28.691]  That, of course, is the high road to dictatorship.
[02:34:29.131 --> 02:34:31.332]  It is the John Yoo Theory.
[02:34:31.892 --> 02:34:38.075]  It is completely inconsistent with what the framers wanted, and is completely inconsistent with our democracy.
[02:34:38.275 --> 02:34:47.558]  In point of fact, Congress has the right, as I've said, to make the decision at war, and Congress also has the right to cut off funds for a war.
[02:34:48.299 --> 02:34:51.720]  It is really rather ironic that for years and years in Vietnam,
[02:34:52.256 --> 02:35:01.584]  We kept hearing from the executive and its supporters that if Congress wanted to act to stop the war, it ought to cut off funds, which ultimately it did for the bombing of Cambodia, by the way.
[02:35:02.324 --> 02:35:12.012]  But today, sometimes some Democrats, Barack Obama and others, have been saying, well, Congress hasn't got a right to stop the executive by cutting off funds.
[02:35:12.173 --> 02:35:13.714]  Of course it has such a right.
[02:35:14.034 --> 02:35:17.257]  That's one of the major powers that Congress has.
[02:35:18.359 --> 02:35:40.665]  And after the Commander-in-Chief power, let me only reiterate, or if I haven't said it, let me say it for the first time, that the reason the President was made Commander-in-Chief was not, of course, so that he can go off and fight wars with armies and navies and air forces anytime he wants, but so that the civilian authority would be subservient to military authority.
[02:35:41.525 --> 02:35:44.749]  It was good enough for George Washington, not good enough for George W. Bush.
[02:36:00.927 --> 02:36:16.155]  Of course it stands to reason and this goes back again to the fortitude of our congressional leaders currently to cut that budget and as we've mentioned they're afraid to do it because of course anything that happens subsequently afterwards will be blamed on them.
[02:36:16.195 --> 02:36:23.199]  They know they'll be set up for this so that does certainly play in this but I believe that we elected them to do exactly this!
[02:36:24.220 --> 02:36:25.201]  Is the point here?
[02:36:25.221 --> 02:36:28.602]  I mean, but here we're looking at Iran right now.
[02:36:28.622 --> 02:36:41.989]  We had to do some reporting today on the program, Dean Velvelle, about Iran, the escalations in Iran, the moving of carrier groups in Iran as a show of force, currently working with terrorist groups in order to infiltrate Iran, certainly.
[02:36:42.589 --> 02:36:50.973]  A lot of people trying to read George W. Bush's or Dick Cheney's mind, or the neocon's mind, saying that the window is closing for them, that if they lose this war in Iraq,
[02:36:51.894 --> 02:36:52.975]  They're going to be blamed for it.
[02:36:53.015 --> 02:36:54.757]  That will be the end of the neocons.
[02:36:54.797 --> 02:36:57.221]  They're ratcheting up what's going on in Iran.
[02:36:57.481 --> 02:37:03.730]  But again, going back to the legal authority, they would have to have the approval of Congress to start this new war.
[02:37:03.910 --> 02:37:08.336]  Or, I guess, they're going to come out and say this is part of the larger international war on terror.
[02:37:09.219 --> 02:37:10.300]  Well, I think you're right.
[02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:27.206]  To take one second before I say why I think you're right, it should also be noted that even the mainstream media reported a little bit, not much, just a little bit about half a year ago that we were fighting Syrians on the border between Iraq and Syria.
[02:37:27.726 --> 02:37:28.767]  Now, the President
[02:37:29.387 --> 02:37:36.773]  He does not currently have the authority to fight Iran, or fight Syria, or fight anybody except Iraq and Al-Qaeda.
[02:37:37.214 --> 02:37:40.256]  And I'll tell you what the authorizations say.
[02:37:40.316 --> 02:37:44.160]  I thought you might ask me a question like this, but I have them in front of me.
[02:37:44.340 --> 02:37:51.806]  The authorization about Iraq says that the President is authorized to use the armed forces against Iraq.
[02:37:52.006 --> 02:37:52.747]  That's it.
[02:37:53.047 --> 02:37:53.788]  Against Iraq.
[02:37:54.249 --> 02:38:04.630]  The authorization of 2001, with regard to terrorist organizations, says that he is authorized to use force against
[02:38:05.307 --> 02:38:06.128]  Then I'm going to quote now.
[02:38:35.907 --> 02:38:40.971]  Let me interrupt you, because I don't know how it occurred to me.
[02:38:41.371 --> 02:38:45.674]  I'm just a simple talk radio host, okay, with a small college education.
[02:38:45.734 --> 02:38:46.514]  How do I know?
[02:38:46.814 --> 02:38:49.016]  How do I know there are no weapons of mass destruction, number one?
[02:38:49.036 --> 02:38:53.579]  How do I know that he's going to take advantage of this, both domestically and with foreign policy?
[02:38:53.619 --> 02:38:59.323]  How was I aware of the PNAC documents, and my wonderful proxy Congress wasn't?
[02:39:03.084 --> 02:39:06.289]  You know, I don't know the answer to your questions.
[02:39:06.669 --> 02:39:09.233]  I can tell you this... I don't want to let him off the hook, is what I'm saying.
[02:39:09.654 --> 02:39:16.404]  Well, I can tell you... I will tell you this, and I hope this is not letting him off the hook, because I don't mean to.
[02:39:17.302 --> 02:39:32.767]  I do believe that at the time, a lot of people, and I would certainly include myself in that because I was on a television show while it was occurring with a fellow from Louisiana, and we both said, Lord, we don't really think we should fight in Iraq, but what do we know?
[02:39:33.587 --> 02:39:36.168]  The President says they have weapons of mass destruction.
[02:39:36.608 --> 02:39:43.094]  He and Powell say they've got conclusive evidence of it, and so who are we to say anything differently?
[02:39:43.555 --> 02:39:51.042]  Now, Congress should have made it its business to debate and determine the truth about this matter, and because of cowardice, it did not.
[02:39:51.062 --> 02:39:58.369]  And you're saying because of 9-11 and the groundswell of support for the President and the neocons after 9-11, they were too scared to stand up to him?
[02:39:58.650 --> 02:39:59.651]  That's exactly what I'm saying.
[02:40:02.524 --> 02:40:04.906]  I mean, we could tackle this on so many levels.
[02:40:04.926 --> 02:40:14.611]  Let's quickly talk about domestic war policy, war powers, the evisceration of the Constitution to keep us safe, to protect us from these alleged enemies.
[02:40:14.652 --> 02:40:30.161]  So what authority, legally, does George W. Bush or the White House have, in reality, to suspend the Constitution, to eviscerate and to attack our rights noted in the Bill of Rights, which they have done continuously now for years?
[02:40:31.152 --> 02:40:33.873]  Well, for my money, they don't have any such right.
[02:40:34.333 --> 02:40:45.218]  And this whole business about spying on people and torturing people, which is against American statutory law, nobody wants to say, by the way.
[02:40:46.099 --> 02:40:49.180]  And I have not heard one member of the mainstream media say it.
[02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:50.961]  Maybe it's been said on your program, I don't know.
[02:40:51.601 --> 02:41:09.368]  But otherwise, I've not heard one member of the mainstream media, television, radio, or the print media say that George Bush and company, and that includes Cheney and Addington and Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, these people are all guilty of a clearly beyond dispute
[02:41:09.868 --> 02:41:17.271]  Of a felony under American domestic law because they have all conspired to produce torture abroad.
[02:41:17.711 --> 02:41:19.272]  That is a felony.
[02:41:19.672 --> 02:41:26.735]  It is punishable for conspiracy up to life imprisonment if people were killed due to conspiracy, as some were.
[02:41:27.335 --> 02:41:33.417]  And for the people who, of course, actually did the killing, the potential punishment ranges up to execution.
[02:41:35.023 --> 02:41:53.989]  You don't find mainstream media talking about this, and it's just another example of how these people have seized power to do whatever they want, regardless of the Bill of Rights, and at least until recently, the media has hardly said boo, and the Congress has not said boo about it.
[02:41:54.549 --> 02:41:59.935]  And we were seriously threatened with vast invasions of our rights in this country.
[02:42:00.115 --> 02:42:07.021]  I think the situation may be turning around a little bit now, but if so, we've only begun to turn it around.
[02:42:07.602 --> 02:42:11.506]  Let's talk about, you wrote a book on the Vietnam War and civil disobedience.
[02:42:11.546 --> 02:42:12.647]  What was the name of that book?
[02:42:14.289 --> 02:42:17.712]  Undeclared War and Civil Disobedience, the American System in Crisis.
[02:42:18.337 --> 02:42:24.942]  And that's important, and you're threatening, if Congress does not stop the Iraq War, that there will be a D.C.
[02:42:25.022 --> 02:42:26.924]  protest of unprecedented size.
[02:42:27.004 --> 02:42:29.405]  I'd like to believe you can get the people out for this.
[02:42:30.266 --> 02:42:31.387]  How important is that?
[02:42:31.507 --> 02:42:33.589]  How important is civil disobedience?
[02:42:33.669 --> 02:42:39.893]  And what role will anti-war rhetoric or anti-war beliefs play in this 08 election?
[02:42:42.139 --> 02:42:43.121]  Well, a number of questions.
[02:42:43.141 --> 02:42:45.585]  Let me first say, I personally am threatening nothing.
[02:42:45.865 --> 02:42:47.328]  I mean, I would not use the word threat.
[02:42:47.989 --> 02:42:54.800]  I'm simply saying, I think that is likely to be, that a massive march on Washington is likely to be what it takes.
[02:42:57.068 --> 02:43:05.591]  Otherwise, I fear that only a march of unprecedented proportions will be sufficient to move the Congress.
[02:43:06.111 --> 02:43:08.832]  I myself am not part of the planning for any such march.
[02:43:08.852 --> 02:43:13.854]  You know, I write and I talk and I run a law school, so I don't have a lot of time.
[02:43:13.874 --> 02:43:16.155]  Well, there are plenty of people out there to do it.
[02:43:16.215 --> 02:43:20.296]  They have not been, as we can say, that successful in getting people out.
[02:43:20.376 --> 02:43:23.677]  I found out after I wrote that posting
[02:43:24.170 --> 02:43:29.872]  I found out that there are groups that are planning a march for January 27th in Washington.
[02:43:30.332 --> 02:43:34.093]  How important do I think something like that could be in stopping this war?
[02:43:34.654 --> 02:43:47.158]  I think it may be the only thing that will stop this war, just as the marches during Vietnam had a great deal to do with ultimately stopping that war, although God knows it took about eight years too long.
[02:43:47.798 --> 02:43:52.620]  And they had a great deal to do with civil rights, the famous march on Washington in 1963.
[02:43:54.443 --> 02:43:57.126]  How do you define civil disobedience?
[02:43:59.108 --> 02:44:06.054]  Well, I gather, I mean, I've always thought that civil disobedience means disobeying the law for moral reasons.
[02:44:06.875 --> 02:44:14.923]  And what I said back in the book that was published in 1970 was that I thought that juries ought to have a right
[02:44:15.763 --> 02:44:20.427]  And other people have said that subsequently, and people have opposed it subsequently.
[02:44:20.928 --> 02:44:32.778]  I thought juries ought to have a right to consider the fact that somebody was acting out of moral conscience and did not actually injure any person or property in what they were doing.
[02:44:33.258 --> 02:44:36.680]  When determining whether to convict somebody for a crime.
[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:53.810]  So that if somebody marched peacefully, or if somebody burned a draft card, didn't strike anybody, didn't murder anybody, didn't blow anything up, that a jury ought to have a right to consider this in determining whether or not to convict somebody.
[02:44:54.190 --> 02:44:55.611]  And you know, one of the ironies is that
[02:44:58.193 --> 02:45:08.343]  According to the law as it stands, juries are not supposed to consider these things, are not allowed to consider these things, although we know that in fact some do sometimes of their own accord.
[02:45:08.363 --> 02:45:12.947]  It would be helpful if the judge instructed the juries on jury nullification.
[02:45:13.228 --> 02:45:19.414]  We cannot even get a guy like Bush or Kissinger or McNamara or Johnson or Rumsfeld into a court to be a defendant.
[02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:29.368]  Well, you know, we were up in New York City for the coronation ceremony for George W. Bush in 2004, and they had these nets.
[02:45:29.428 --> 02:45:36.195]  I mean, this shows you kind of the semantical argument of some of these legal precedents where, you know, what is civil disobedience?
[02:45:36.215 --> 02:45:37.256]  That's why I asked you the question.
[02:45:37.516 --> 02:45:44.163]  I almost got nabbed up in a net just for crossing the street, and I had press passes, congressional passes, bar cords, bar
[02:45:46.115 --> 02:45:47.856]  Codes hanging around my neck.
[02:45:48.036 --> 02:46:05.183]  So I'm, you know, congressionally approved to be at the convention to cover this for the media and really they just have these nets out to Dean Velville who would grab people up, send them out to a dirty pier somewhere, keep them on a really no authority until the convention was over.
[02:46:05.223 --> 02:46:06.503]  Just snagged them right up.
[02:46:07.304 --> 02:46:10.725]  Yes, I know, you know, we became aware of all that and
[02:46:11.314 --> 02:46:31.543]  What can one do we say except that the government is full of Richard J. Dailies, if you see what I mean, who will do whatever it takes, in their opinion, to keep people from peacefully protesting, from getting their point across to the body politic at large, who are perfectly happy to do whatever works to suppress
[02:46:32.283 --> 02:46:32.923]  Uh, dissent.
[02:46:33.384 --> 02:46:39.146]  And you were involved in the situation of that kind, just as the protesters were in 1968.
[02:46:40.366 --> 02:46:52.991]  And as I said, the Richard J. Dailies, the George W. Bushes, they don't even face prosecution, whereas rather innocent people cannot, people are rather innocent by comparison, I should say.
[02:46:53.431 --> 02:46:55.533]  I'm talking about people who are not
[02:47:15.010 --> 02:47:16.892]  Sure, and we're on the same page with that.
[02:47:17.172 --> 02:47:24.600]  Dean Lawrence Velville is with us from the Massachusetts School of Law and his website is velvilleonnationalaffairs.com.
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:26.481]  It's a very informative website.
[02:47:26.742 --> 02:47:28.103]  Let me ask you about impeachment.
[02:47:28.143 --> 02:47:35.090]  I'm looking at a story from Paul Craig Roberts, who is alleged to be the father of Reaganomics, a true conservative.
[02:47:35.770 --> 02:47:40.774]  Saying, when are the American people and the representatives in Congress and the military going to wake up and realize that the U.S.
[02:47:40.814 --> 02:47:48.219]  has an insane war criminal in the White House who is destroying all chances for peace in the world and establishing a police state in the U.S.?
[02:47:48.539 --> 02:47:53.683]  Americans don't have much time to realize this, and they have to act before it's too late.
[02:47:54.584 --> 02:47:58.066]  Suggesting that if we don't impeach him, he's going to continue to do these things.
[02:47:58.126 --> 02:48:01.109]  I don't know if censoring him is possible.
[02:48:01.569 --> 02:48:04.391]  Censorship or... not the way it's spelled, folks.
[02:48:04.811 --> 02:48:07.976]  Well, viable possibility, I don't know, because that depends on the courage of the Democrats in Congress.
[02:48:22.859 --> 02:48:28.704]  Encourage is a quality which they have shown to be... Is it desirable?
[02:48:29.145 --> 02:48:30.566]  You bet it's desirable.
[02:48:30.626 --> 02:48:34.930]  We should get rid of, by impeachment, of both Bush and Cheney.
[02:48:35.370 --> 02:48:41.195]  I guess that would make Nancy Pelosi the president these days, and that would not be all bad if you ask me.
[02:48:41.316 --> 02:48:42.857]  Okay, we'll disagree there.
[02:48:43.237 --> 02:48:44.358]  Stay with us for one more segment.
[02:48:44.378 --> 02:48:45.039]  We'll come back, folks.
[02:48:48.777 --> 02:48:49.237]  It's here!
[02:48:49.458 --> 02:48:54.241]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.601 --> 02:49:02.267]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.947 --> 02:49:09.993]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.393 --> 02:49:17.238]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:17.751 --> 02:49:21.813]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.114 --> 02:49:25.616]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.096 --> 02:49:27.997]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.337 --> 02:49:32.260]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:07.522 --> 02:52:10.403]  You are listening to the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:52:10.423 --> 02:52:11.864]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:52:11.904 --> 02:52:13.505]  We're just wrapping up the program today.
[02:52:13.645 --> 02:52:18.747]  I will be back tomorrow with more guests, more news and information you're not supposed to know about.
[02:52:19.067 --> 02:52:22.469]  Great job, Dean Lawrence Velville of the Massachusetts School of Law.
[02:52:22.489 --> 02:52:26.751]  Again, his blog, his website is velvilleonnationalaffairs.com.
[02:52:26.991 --> 02:52:30.013]  That's linked right now on the front page at infowars.com.
[02:52:30.453 --> 02:52:35.619]  I just wanted to keep you long enough, Dean Velville, to ask you, you know, what are the marching orders?
[02:52:36.019 --> 02:52:40.964]  What can we all focus on and work together on to try to create some change here?
[02:52:41.004 --> 02:52:47.191]  Is there something we can do that doesn't obviously require a lot of time because Americans don't have a lot of that?
[02:52:47.551 --> 02:52:48.772]  What can we do right now?
[02:52:49.833 --> 02:52:52.857]  Well, right now, I think that as many people as possible
[02:52:53.453 --> 02:53:08.198]  Should attend this March on Washington, because I think that is going to be, a lot of the story is going to be told by how many people show up, because if it's a normal, small turnout, it will have no effect.
[02:53:08.518 --> 02:53:13.020]  If it's a huge, massive, unlooked-for turnout, it could have a great effect.
[02:53:13.622 --> 02:53:29.391]  Over the longer term, I think we must do something in this country, which has rarely been thought about, and which certainly was not thought about before this war, that is to determine... I'll allow that fellow who wrote Ron Clausewitz.
[02:53:29.971 --> 02:53:32.673]  We must determine, what is this country?
[02:53:32.733 --> 02:53:38.876]  What are this country's desirable, necessary, strategic goals in the world?
[02:53:39.822 --> 02:53:44.667]  And then what are the tactics we should use to obtain those goals?
[02:53:45.267 --> 02:53:59.240]  I think that when we think about it, I don't know, but I think that when we think about it, we're going to find out that there are about 15 or 20 countries in this world which we have a great moral, economic,
[02:54:00.121 --> 02:54:06.707]  Uh, historical interest in and that we should be willing to protect to participate in their defense.
[02:54:07.267 --> 02:54:15.114]  Uh, and that it is only for those countries that we really ought to be willing to go to war in the absence of an attack upon ourselves.
[02:54:15.655 --> 02:54:23.862]  And I think that after we think about it, we are likely to find that those countries, our nations, including some of our bitter former enemies,
[02:54:24.580 --> 02:54:31.787]  Like Britain, like Canada, like France, like the New Germany, like the New Japan, like Israel, like Australia.
[02:54:32.528 --> 02:54:36.912]  Nations of that kind with which we have so much in common in so many ways.
[02:54:37.352 --> 02:54:41.336]  I'm leaving out some of the complexities like where you're going to get oil from and stuff like that.
[02:54:41.897 --> 02:54:45.340]  But whatever it turns out to be, I think we have to make some
[02:54:46.112 --> 02:54:55.909]  Do some studying and make some decisions as to what are this country's long-term strategic goals and interests and what are the appropriate tactics for attempting to achieve them.
[02:54:56.411 --> 02:55:06.583]  And on some level, I have to add to this that we have to continue to fight the information war and get the appropriate information, real information, not propaganda out to the American people, the people around the world.
[02:55:06.643 --> 02:55:15.233]  So, to some extent, we have to go after these media watchdogs or media gatekeepers who are going along with this entire process.
[02:55:15.574 --> 02:55:16.575]  I could not agree more.
[02:55:17.333 --> 02:55:18.714]  And there's a lot of ways to do that.
[02:55:18.754 --> 02:55:25.416]  We talk on this program perpetually about how you can do that, and we're always interested in new and more ideas.
[02:55:25.476 --> 02:55:30.758]  Well, Dean Velville, I appreciate all your hard work over the decades, and, you know, I hope this amounts to something.
[02:55:30.798 --> 02:55:32.359]  I hope we're turning a corner here.
[02:55:32.939 --> 02:55:42.562]  It appears that the American people are starting to open their eyes, get that sleep out of their eyes, and may become active, something I'm sure that the Bush administration does not ever want to see.
[02:55:42.843 --> 02:55:44.683]  Dean Velville, thank you for joining us on the program.
[02:55:45.063 --> 02:55:46.464]  Okay, you're welcome, and thank you.
[02:55:47.054 --> 02:55:47.915]  Thank you for joining us.
