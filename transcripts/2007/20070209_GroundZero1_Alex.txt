[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:01.791]  I've got like 10 minutes of broadcast time left.
[00:00:01.791 --> 00:00:04.133]  This is huge news.
[00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.815]  Earlier we reported on a gentleman who's about to go public, hopefully.
[00:00:06.815 --> 00:00:07.876]  Ground zero, EMT.
[00:00:07.876 --> 00:00:09.378]  We were told to get out of the building.
[00:00:09.378 --> 00:00:11.560]  The building 7 was going to be demolished.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.562]  We've got that report, but a new one's going up.
[00:00:13.562 --> 00:00:14.643]  There's so many of these people.
[00:00:14.643 --> 00:00:21.209]  Lou Cacioli and the firefighters talking about bombs going off and molten steel like lava.
[00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:23.431]  This is from the program Guns and Butter.
[00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:25.773]  Big program, nationally syndicated, out of New York.
[00:00:27.153 --> 00:00:41.118]  And this is where they are interviewing Kevin McPadden, we'll tell you about him, emergency worker, and Indra Singh, emergency worker, where they're talking about the bombs and being told to get back, they're going to bring Building 7 down.
[00:00:41.118 --> 00:00:47.180]  So here are real people on the record, more of them, and what do the Feds do on their websites?
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.060]  They just say none of it's real.
[00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:49.926]  Yeah, well it is real.
[00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:54.892]  I couldn't literally do my work because of the firefighters slapping me on the back and saying, we know they blew up 7.
[00:00:54.892 --> 00:00:56.073]  We were told to get back.
[00:00:56.073 --> 00:00:56.714]  Okay?
[00:00:56.714 --> 00:00:59.357]  At the remembrance, at ground zero.
[00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:06.745]  Let's go ahead and roll this first clip from Guns and Butter, the nationally syndicated program with Indra Singh.
[00:01:06.745 --> 00:01:07.106]  Here it is.
[00:01:08.186 --> 00:01:21.836]  What we were expecting as an EMT, you're trained for live survivors and there were people on the pile digging and looking for survivors and what would happen is they would bring someone out to the nearest triage center.
[00:01:21.836 --> 00:01:25.618]  We would stabilize them, put them in an ambulance and send them further uptown.
[00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:32.383]  So we were setting up triage as close to the pile as possible, you know, as on it in many cases.
[00:01:32.383 --> 00:01:34.224]  So what we were doing was setting up
[00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:46.913]  Different kinds of stations, IV stations, cardiac stations, just wound stations, burn stations, just trying to have an organized space.
[00:01:46.913 --> 00:01:59.902]  What happened with that particular triage site is that pretty soon afternoon, after midday on 9-11, we had to evacuate that because they told us Building 7 was coming down.
[00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.899]  I don't think so.
[00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:37.861]  Did they actually use the word brought down?
[00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:40.564]  And who was it that was telling you this?
[00:02:40.564 --> 00:02:41.644]  The fire department.
[00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:46.528]  And they did use the word we're going to have to bring it down.
[00:02:46.528 --> 00:02:56.417]  And for us there, observing the nature of the devastation, it made total sense to us that this was indeed a possibility.
[00:02:57.277 --> 00:03:00.360]  Given the subsequent controversy over it, I don't know.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.981]  You know, I'm not an engineer.
[00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:02.541]  I don't know.
[00:03:02.541 --> 00:03:06.424]  All I know is, you know, that was my experience.
[00:03:06.424 --> 00:03:08.926]  We backed off a little bit to Pace University.
[00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:15.690]  There was another panic around four o'clock because they were bringing the building down and people seemed to know this ahead of time.
[00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.353]  So people were panicking again and running.
[00:03:19.353 --> 00:03:19.833]  I went
[00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:30.295]  Back to One Liberty, which was further south of where I was before, and there were triage sites set up in there.
[00:03:30.295 --> 00:03:40.419]  We were treating basically people who were on the pile digging for survivors, if there were any, and it was basically chaos.
[00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:46.181]  I asked who was in charge, for instance, because I'm supposed to check in with whoever's in charge, and no one seemed to know.
[00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:50.323]  It was complete and utter chaos there, if there was someone in charge.
[00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:58.549]  The normal response units around for a multi-casualty incident they didn't know.
[00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:05.452]  One of the big problems is that so many people in the fire department and the police department at a high level... And we're going to go through all this and play more of it tomorrow.
[00:04:05.452 --> 00:04:08.753]  We're going to get the host and these individuals on very soon.
[00:04:08.753 --> 00:04:09.973]  That's the main priority, Kevin.
[00:04:09.973 --> 00:04:10.373]  Get on it.
[00:04:10.373 --> 00:04:13.254]  I know you're already on it.
[00:04:13.254 --> 00:04:14.755]  Let's be clear.
[00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:20.557]  Now when they fall back and say, okay, maybe we did blow it up, then there's no discussion of how it takes weeks to set a building to be imploded.
[00:04:22.415 --> 00:04:24.396]  Okay.
[00:04:24.396 --> 00:04:30.919]  And I remember ABC News when I was in the car that afternoon when it fell.
[00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.800]  Then I got home and saw the replays.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.901]  They were announcing Building 7 was on fire.
[00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:36.822]  It could fall and damage other buildings.
[00:04:36.822 --> 00:04:38.043]  So they want to bring it down.
[00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:43.225]  They may bring it down to save other buildings.
[00:04:43.225 --> 00:04:43.966]  Everybody heard it.
[00:04:43.966 --> 00:04:45.146]  The firemen all heard it.
[00:04:45.146 --> 00:04:48.608]  It's hidden in plain view.
[00:04:48.608 --> 00:04:50.269]  And it's still tonight.
[00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:55.974]  People still try to deny it.
[00:04:55.974 --> 00:05:00.537]  I've talked to countless firefighters, and there have been firefighters in newspapers and magazines that have said it.
[00:05:00.537 --> 00:05:03.059]  Bombs going off.
[00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:04.079]  They were told to get back.
[00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:06.921]  It was going to be brought down.
[00:05:06.921 --> 00:05:09.403]  No modern steel building had ever fallen from fire.
[00:05:09.403 --> 00:05:10.884]  Three of them did that day.
[00:05:10.884 --> 00:05:13.206]  Building 7 not hit by a plane.
[00:05:13.206 --> 00:05:19.050]  Play one more time the firefighters talking about the molten steel running down the channel rails like a foundry in Tower 1 and 2.
[00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.490]  You got that?
[00:05:22.432 --> 00:05:24.113]  Because this is so important.
[00:05:24.113 --> 00:05:24.994]  Here it is.
[00:05:24.994 --> 00:05:28.517]  You'd get down below and you'd see molten steel.
[00:05:28.517 --> 00:05:30.959]  Molten steel running down the channel rails.
[00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:33.701]  Like you're in a foundry.
[00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:35.242]  Like lava.
[00:05:35.242 --> 00:05:37.784]  Like lava in the volcano.
[00:05:37.784 --> 00:05:44.969]  Now that's Tower 1 and 2 brought down by unconventional demolitions, cutter charges, and blast charges.
[00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.210]  But then you have Building 7.
[00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.054]  And when we get back, Kevin McFadden, emergency worker,
[00:05:51.798 --> 00:05:54.940]  And what he saw and what he witnessed.
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.101]  So, you want names?
[00:05:56.101 --> 00:05:57.922]  There are names right there.
[00:05:57.922 --> 00:06:00.164]  And the names go on and on and on.
[00:06:00.164 --> 00:06:03.886]  Do you have the clip where they're talking about it looked like it was a controlled demolition as if they had detonators?
[00:06:03.886 --> 00:06:06.188]  Boom, boom, boom?
[00:06:06.188 --> 00:06:07.188]  Yeah, we'll get that clip too.
[00:06:07.188 --> 00:06:08.549]  We'll play that coming out.
[00:06:08.549 --> 00:06:10.310]  Then we'll play the new clip for you.
[00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.851]  How's that sound?
[00:06:11.851 --> 00:06:17.355]  A fire department situation room filled with firefighters talking about it.
[00:06:17.355 --> 00:06:18.216]  Okay?
[00:06:18.216 --> 00:06:19.597]  We got two in the computer.
[00:06:19.597 --> 00:06:21.498]  Make sure it's the one that's got the cussing cut out, please.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.103]  Sometimes we have the raw clip in there too.
[00:06:26.103 --> 00:06:31.027]  John working like an octopus with 18 arms.
[00:06:31.027 --> 00:06:33.589]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:37.312]  Final segment in the InfoWars Zone.
[00:06:37.312 --> 00:06:42.937]  Engaging the enemy at point-blank range and winning every time.
