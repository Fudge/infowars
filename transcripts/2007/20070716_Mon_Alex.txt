[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.981]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.622 --> 00:00:11.442]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.202 --> 00:00:13.122]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:17.564]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.944 --> 00:00:22.045]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:36.219]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.699]  Welcome.
[00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.440]  It is Monday, the 16th day of July 2007.
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.261]  And we're going to have wide open phones for the next two hours.
[00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:52.123]  Then in the third hour, I'm scheduled to have Chuck Walters, the head guy at AcresUSA.
[00:00:52.623 --> 00:00:57.384]  I've run into the magazine a few times and read it, and it's just great information on organic gardening and
[00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:01.259]  Just a whole host of issues.
[00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.981]  It's basically anti-New World Order at the same time, but it's a mainline publication.
[00:01:06.342 --> 00:01:07.762]  It's based right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:07.782 --> 00:01:13.165]  So I, months ago, told my producer, hey, we ought to get them on, and voila, here they are.
[00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:16.467]  So that's coming up in the third hour today.
[00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:25.952]  I really will take a lot of your calls today because I fantasize about the few shows where I've actually controlled myself and taken
[00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:31.968]  A hundred, two hundred phone calls, but if we're going to do that it means I do have to go to you quickly and I do have to...
[00:01:33.146 --> 00:01:35.027]  Hang up on you quickly and go to the next person.
[00:01:35.047 --> 00:01:36.548]  So have your comment, your question ready.
[00:01:36.908 --> 00:01:40.390]  First time callers, go to the head of the line and trump everyone.
[00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.011]  So if you tell, we don't screen your calls.
[00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:44.233]  You tell us where you're calling from and your first name.
[00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:49.376]  But if you choose to tell us that you disagree, you go to the head of the line.
[00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:54.639]  Unless we're doing a show where we're calling for first time callers, then you go to the head of the line.
[00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.560]  But anyone who wants to call in is welcome.
[00:01:58.301 --> 00:02:00.102]  It's just we do have the chronic pluggers.
[00:02:00.797 --> 00:02:13.565]  And I never mind people calling in 2, 3, 4, 5 times with plugs, but when it turns into you take 6, 7 calls in a row, everyone is plugging and it's the same pluggers each week, it just gets old.
[00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:18.328]  So if you are calling in plugging, just be ready for me to let you make your plug and then I'm going to hang up on you.
[00:02:18.348 --> 00:02:19.009]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:20.770]  1-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:30.935]  I feel like I had a vacation.
[00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:36.259]  I got 8 hours sleep last night and you know you're working too much when getting 8 hours sleep.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.163]  Going to bed at midnight or 12.30 and sleep until 8.30.
[00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:47.528]  When you feel like you've had a vacation, you're working too much.
[00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:54.633]  Endgame is above and beyond any film I've ever made and we are racing.
[00:02:55.453 --> 00:02:56.935]  To get this out for you.
[00:02:57.715 --> 00:03:00.458]  But also, the film is now two hours long.
[00:03:01.178 --> 00:03:03.100]  I wanted to keep it below two hours long.
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.004]  And frankly, it looks like it's going to be more than two hours long.
[00:03:07.284 --> 00:03:11.588]  I just don't know why I can't make a film that's 90 minutes or 100 minutes.
[00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.352]  I'm already digressing today.
[00:03:15.432 --> 00:03:17.414]  We have a lot of really important news.
[00:03:18.504 --> 00:03:22.526]  Here in front of us, and we'll be going over that after the break.
[00:03:22.546 --> 00:03:28.409]  There's also a television show from 1996, this episode, called The Exo Squad.
[00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:40.596]  I remember surfing through the television dial in the early and mid-90s when this TV show was on, and I had a vague memory of this TV show.
[00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:52.656]  And talk about anti-New World Order, but then Bertrand Russell or one of the globalist tacticians, theoreticians would argue, no, this is all part of the larger conditioning program.
[00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:59.280]  But I don't know, the resistance message is so overt in this, that may not be the case.
[00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:04.884]  I would imagine those that produced it, if we tracked them down and got them on, are anti-New World Order.
[00:04:05.524 --> 00:04:08.506]  But I would guess that Viacom, who aired it,
[00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:14.035]  Sumner Redstone allowed it because they, the Overlords, would see it as further conditioning.
[00:04:14.535 --> 00:04:16.116]  Depends on how you look at it.
[00:04:17.276 --> 00:04:25.559]  But we're going to be playing that when we get back from the break, and then I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:25.819]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.921]  Friday night they released the new Bin Laden tape.
[00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:31.021]  I saw it and said, I've seen that tape.
[00:04:32.962 --> 00:04:37.664]  And I did a little bit of internet surfing, and sure enough, I'll tell you what I discovered when we get back.
[00:04:38.706 --> 00:04:43.669]  We'll play the XO Squad Club and get into some of the news we'll be covering later in the show.
[00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:45.451]  We'll start taking your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:48.613]  The websites are JonesReport.com, InfoWars.net and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:49.153]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:05.012]  It's here!
[00:05:05.232 --> 00:05:10.020]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:18.012]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:25.751]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.152 --> 00:05:37.595]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.895 --> 00:05:41.577]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.857 --> 00:05:43.797]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.118 --> 00:05:47.959]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:56.005]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:11.266]  Now, you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.506 --> 00:06:22.754]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw, stagnant pond water, into delicious, crystal-clear drinking water.
[00:06:23.074 --> 00:06:28.558]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:28.578 --> 00:06:29.138]  I think so.
[00:06:47.193 --> 00:06:50.255]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[00:06:51.055 --> 00:06:54.077]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:54.137 --> 00:07:00.200]  That's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.962]  Do you know that you can go solar for under $1,200 bucks now?
[00:07:04.482 --> 00:07:05.623]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[00:07:05.803 --> 00:07:09.945]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:15.438]  The solar power generators I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:22.362]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more!
[00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:25.823]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[00:07:25.983 --> 00:07:35.950]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.933]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:46.477]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[00:07:46.657 --> 00:07:47.698]  Are you ready to go solar?
[00:07:47.898 --> 00:07:48.859]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:56.804]  Or order them on the website at a 10% discount on KenSolar.com.
[00:07:57.064 --> 00:07:59.425]  That's KenSolar.com.
[00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:07.710]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.791 --> 00:08:18.216]  Coming up, we're going to get into the orchestrated fear-mongering ongoing for the last three and a half weeks with the kickoff of the two botched
[00:08:18.983 --> 00:08:22.205]  Fire bombings in Scotland and in England.
[00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:33.113]  And now we have the new Bin Laden tape, the number two of Al-Qaeda, saying that they're going to strike us since they were behind the bombings in England.
[00:08:34.394 --> 00:08:39.878]  And of course your phone calls, Kenny, Steve, Diana, Dylan, Trina, many others that are patiently holding.
[00:08:40.158 --> 00:08:41.459]  But here's the XO Squad.
[00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:42.760]  We're going to play a few minutes of this.
[00:08:43.385 --> 00:08:57.901]  TV program in the mid 1990s for children where there's been this genetically engineered form of humans that I guess were used in space terra farming and now have come back to earth and are dominating and ruling us.
[00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:04.188]  So again you have the eugenics theme of these super humans that are about 12 feet tall
[00:09:05.032 --> 00:09:09.775]  Dominating the mere earthlings here, making us take our microchips.
[00:09:09.855 --> 00:09:10.555]  Again, the H.G.
[00:09:10.595 --> 00:09:25.964]  Wells, Aldous Huxley, Bertrand Russell, they all wrote about how they would create a new elite species, they already believed the elite to be a separate species, and then how they would then enslave us, put microchips in us, this was written in the thirties, and then kill us.
[00:09:26.604 --> 00:09:29.846]  And they're following that exact plan, and they said it would be a plan.
[00:09:30.456 --> 00:09:35.380]  Starting with mass drugging, using television to brainwash you, all happening right now.
[00:09:36.521 --> 00:09:39.723]  Here is a clip from a TV show in the mid-1990s.
[00:09:40.644 --> 00:09:51.973]  My friends, to assist in our recovery, the Neo-Sapien Occupation Committee has ordered all Terrans to register with the Neo-Sapien Central Administration at once.
[00:09:52.973 --> 00:09:58.658]  During this registration, a small identification chip will be implanted under the skin.
[00:09:59.585 --> 00:10:02.446]  This will be mandatory for all natural humans.
[00:10:03.086 --> 00:10:11.010]  Those who fail to register will be considered enemies of the Neo-Sapien government and will be dealt with accordingly.
[00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.791]  The Sapes are here to help us?
[00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:15.071]  What a crock.
[00:10:16.012 --> 00:10:21.274]  Large enthusiastic crowds have turned out for the first day of mandatory civil registration.
[00:10:21.814 --> 00:10:22.854]  Registration?
[00:10:23.735 --> 00:10:26.876]  Any jerk can see they're on their way to a concentration camp.
[00:10:28.147 --> 00:10:32.452]  Phaeton must subjugate the planet quickly and brutally and publicly.
[00:10:33.072 --> 00:10:36.015]  As long as humans believe they can resist, they will.
[00:10:36.716 --> 00:10:43.042]  Advanced neo-sapien technology has made the implantation process simple and completely painless.
[00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.311]  What was that?
[00:10:47.111 --> 00:10:49.952]  Registration is over!
[00:10:50.492 --> 00:10:53.153]  In the name of the people of the Homeworld!
[00:10:53.873 --> 00:10:54.394]  Sean!
[00:10:55.094 --> 00:10:57.555]  Death to all collaborators!
[00:10:58.075 --> 00:11:03.817]  They're on their own now.
[00:11:04.537 --> 00:11:07.198]  We can't give up the Earth without a fight!
[00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:09.099]  Join the Resistance!
[00:11:09.619 --> 00:11:10.980]  We're fighting for you!
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.300]  Join us!
[00:11:24.255 --> 00:11:25.355]  What did we accomplish?
[00:11:26.036 --> 00:11:27.216]  People are too afraid!
[00:11:28.017 --> 00:11:30.898]  Maybe the human race doesn't deserve to survive.
[00:11:31.318 --> 00:11:32.258]  They won't fight.
[00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:33.999]  Not if they think they can't win.
[00:11:34.479 --> 00:11:35.980]  They've got to have some hope.
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.862]  Hope is one thing I'm fresh out of.
[00:11:41.082 --> 00:11:42.923]  Napier, I've got a plan.
[00:11:44.128 --> 00:11:46.715]  We'll show the people the Resistance can win.
[00:11:46.735 --> 00:11:49.943]  And at the same time, we'll link up with the Exo Fleet.
[00:11:51.587 --> 00:11:51.928]  Okay.
[00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:53.391]  What do we do?
[00:12:29.852 --> 00:12:31.614]  I'll take this.
[00:12:32.054 --> 00:12:33.155]  The weapon.
[00:12:33.416 --> 00:12:34.877]  It would complete my disguise.
[00:12:35.377 --> 00:12:39.601]  Listen, Marsh may trust you, but you're still just another Neo to me.
[00:12:40.082 --> 00:12:41.183]  I'll keep the blaster.
[00:12:41.303 --> 00:12:43.144]  You just get us into the broadcast center.
[00:12:43.405 --> 00:12:44.646]  Now hurry up with the uniform.
[00:12:46.814 --> 00:12:53.718]  This is an important day for Chicago.
[00:12:53.738 --> 00:12:56.359]  Now, stay tuned.
[00:12:56.559 --> 00:13:01.121]  Neo-Sapiens.
[00:13:01.941 --> 00:13:06.564]  By right of conquest, the homeworlds are ours.
[00:13:07.624 --> 00:13:11.526]  The superiority of the Neo-Sapien race has triumphed.
[00:13:12.286 --> 00:13:15.388]  Those who opposed us have been crushed.
[00:13:16.605 --> 00:13:24.087]  Terrans who accept the Neo-Sapien peace will be tolerated in the New World Order.
[00:13:24.347 --> 00:13:33.650]  Those who refuse and resist will be eliminated.
[00:13:34.991 --> 00:13:37.472]  I have my orders to report to the broadcast center.
[00:13:40.973 --> 00:13:42.553]  Don't anybody move!
[00:13:43.013 --> 00:13:44.614]  ...were to be their salvation.
[00:13:46.255 --> 00:13:47.196]  Now I warned ya!
[00:13:47.376 --> 00:13:48.517]  I won't say it again!
[00:13:48.957 --> 00:13:49.597]  Look out!
[00:13:55.161 --> 00:13:56.682]  Thanks.
[00:13:56.822 --> 00:13:57.823]  My son.
[00:13:57.843 --> 00:14:00.145]  You are welcome, Mr. Napier.
[00:14:00.165 --> 00:14:02.006]  But now there is much work to do.
[00:14:02.066 --> 00:14:05.809]  If we act promptly, we can save many lives on both sides.
[00:14:05.989 --> 00:14:09.471]  It will take a few minutes to get set up.
[00:14:10.051 --> 00:14:12.353]  Let's just hope Marsh comes through when he's supposed to.
[00:14:25.233 --> 00:14:27.135]  Good luck changing Mars, sir.
[00:14:27.235 --> 00:14:28.536]  I've reprogrammed the computer.
[00:14:28.796 --> 00:14:29.436]  I'm ready to play.
[00:14:29.476 --> 00:14:29.977]  I'm excited.
[00:14:30.197 --> 00:14:31.618]  Okay, let's do it.
[00:14:32.058 --> 00:14:39.844]  I have chosen this city to be the capital of Neo-Sapien Earth, heart of the Neo-Sapien homeworlds.
[00:14:40.544 --> 00:14:47.789]  Once humanity understands my vision for the future, you will all come to love us.
[00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:48.210]  Look!
[00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.791]  What is it, John?
[00:14:52.039 --> 00:14:55.182]  Do not believe Neo-Sapien lies!
[00:14:55.983 --> 00:14:57.544]  We are not defeated!
[00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:04.169]  With the help of the Exo-Fleet, we will rid ourselves of the Neo-Sapien tyrants!
[00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.672]  Humans of the homeworlds, unite!
[00:15:08.132 --> 00:15:09.293]  Take back your freedom!
[00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:16.249]  Just stand there, you fool!
[00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:21.635]  Together, we can defeat the Neo-Sapien oppression!
[00:15:22.036 --> 00:15:23.818]  Never lose hope!
[00:15:23.878 --> 00:15:25.801]  You dare oppose me?
[00:15:28.264 --> 00:15:29.285]  Find that human.
[00:15:29.325 --> 00:15:30.847]  Bring me his head.
[00:15:52.782 --> 00:15:56.004]  Governor Phaeton, I'm so pleased that you're safe.
[00:15:56.464 --> 00:16:01.387]  I have been made to look a fool by natural humans.
[00:16:01.867 --> 00:16:03.769]  Governor, we'll find the criminals.
[00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:07.791]  You said you could control the Terrans.
[00:16:08.651 --> 00:16:11.993]  Take this useless human away.
[00:16:12.594 --> 00:16:15.736]  But Phaeton, I was cooperating!
[00:16:15.956 --> 00:16:16.956]  We must talk!
[00:16:17.136 --> 00:16:17.897]  Wait!
[00:16:23.131 --> 00:16:24.652]  Let us link up with the police.
[00:16:25.472 --> 00:16:28.954]  Man, I tell ya, I hated to leave like that.
[00:16:29.034 --> 00:16:30.895]  I almost had Phaeton in my sights.
[00:16:31.315 --> 00:16:32.856]  We'll be back, Brodsky.
[00:16:33.817 --> 00:16:39.580]  And we'll keep coming back until the Earth is free again.
[00:16:42.442 --> 00:16:44.423]  So the New World Order...
[00:16:47.168 --> 00:16:58.293]  Overall conditioning though, now the public doesn't know why they're conditioned to accept the New World Order, why they're conditioned to think of microchips under the skin without even watching cartoons.
[00:16:59.134 --> 00:17:02.455]  That is, trying to watch cartoons since I was about 12 years old.
[00:17:04.336 --> 00:17:11.540]  Just surfing around, limited television watching, I did as a teenager and in college and even in the last few years.
[00:17:12.225 --> 00:17:17.689]  I'd have to say half the shows I tuned into, it'd be the new Fantastic Four.
[00:17:18.469 --> 00:17:29.797]  I saw that back when I was in college, and they were every episode, because I have a few days I was looking through TV, and I'd come across it when it was on, and every time I tuned in, the UN was commanding the Fantastic Four.
[00:17:30.518 --> 00:17:38.924]  They were fighting, the UN would fight aliens, and the UN World Army would fail, but the Fantastic Four would be able to defeat them.
[00:17:39.204 --> 00:17:41.646]  Now again, that's not the old Fantastic Four.
[00:17:42.831 --> 00:17:47.233]  That's the new Fantastic Four, which I guess was out in the 80s or 90s, I'm not sure.
[00:17:49.514 --> 00:18:01.500]  And, of course, there's a small clip of a TV show, a cartoon in Road to Tyranny, where it's like, hey, I'm here to give you a FedEx delivery and I've got to take a blood type test and check your microchip.
[00:18:03.761 --> 00:18:05.481]  And then Time Magazine for children.
[00:18:08.043 --> 00:18:08.643]  Two separate
[00:18:09.901 --> 00:18:20.169]  Issues that we saw back in 2002, that were mailed to us by listeners, said, your parents are backwards and don't know, you'll soon be getting a chip, it's going to be so wonderful.
[00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.552]  I mean, folks, this is being done by design.
[00:18:26.674 --> 00:18:28.676]  It's being done by design.
[00:18:31.498 --> 00:18:34.160]  Speaking of a new species, again, here's Bertrand Russell's
[00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:43.017]  Quote from a book he published, Nobel Prize winner, top global strategist, top global strategist, mathematician, scientist.
[00:18:43.578 --> 00:18:53.528]  The Impact of Science on Society, page 4950 of the 1953 published The Impact of Science on Society.
[00:18:54.709 --> 00:19:00.875]  Gradually, by selective breeding, the congenital differences between rulers and ruled
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.843]  will increase until they become almost different species.
[00:19:06.484 --> 00:19:15.151]  A revolt of the plebes would become as unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton.
[00:19:17.773 --> 00:19:28.161]  Now the elite, we find writings 3,000 years old from Babylon, 4,000 years old from Egypt, 2,400 years old from Plato's time in Greece,
[00:19:33.095 --> 00:19:36.636]  Where the elite say, we are a different species, we are different from the commoner.
[00:19:37.377 --> 00:19:44.939]  And then through bleeding and feudal systems to starve the population by design, they would even dwarf our stature but not our intellects.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.420]  It's their religion.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:20:01.125]  You see, now with the transhumanism, post-humanism movement, they believe they're actually in grasp, they're gonna augment themselves with cybernetic interfaces, and then claim that we're not even as advanced.
[00:20:02.651 --> 00:20:04.713]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.334 --> 00:20:14.262]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.703 --> 00:20:21.930]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.623 --> 00:20:28.125]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.605 --> 00:20:39.448]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.188 --> 00:20:42.328]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.768 --> 00:20:44.189]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:48.751 --> 00:20:51.235]  Or, visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:20:51.315 --> 00:20:51.796]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:21:01.394 --> 00:21:07.596]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:08.056 --> 00:21:15.818]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:16.179 --> 00:21:24.021]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:24.341 --> 00:21:29.085]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:29.425 --> 00:21:34.149]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:38.513]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:39.013 --> 00:21:40.014]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:40.094 --> 00:21:44.177]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:44.598 --> 00:21:49.001]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:49.502 --> 00:21:52.024]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:52.464 --> 00:21:54.585]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.725 --> 00:21:57.505]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.625 --> 00:22:06.188]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:22:06.328 --> 00:22:14.410]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:21.712]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:22:21.912 --> 00:22:23.193]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:22:23.273 --> 00:22:29.158]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:22:29.358 --> 00:22:34.442]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:43.429]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[00:22:43.709 --> 00:22:47.212]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:22:49.093 --> 00:22:51.695]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach!
[00:22:51.715 --> 00:22:51.895]  Look!
[00:22:51.995 --> 00:22:53.556]  Up there in the sky!
[00:22:53.636 --> 00:22:54.237]  It's Non-X-Man!
[00:22:54.257 --> 00:22:54.837]  He's in a dive!
[00:22:54.917 --> 00:22:57.039]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach!
[00:22:57.059 --> 00:22:57.379]  Let's go look!
[00:23:14.108 --> 00:23:17.290]  I'm Non-X-Man, and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.050]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:19.731]  Take them out.
[00:23:20.331 --> 00:23:21.011]  Let's see.
[00:23:21.031 --> 00:23:25.594]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[00:23:25.954 --> 00:23:26.434]  Don't worry.
[00:23:26.894 --> 00:23:28.395]  Now there's Non-X nail gel.
[00:23:29.035 --> 00:23:33.437]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[00:23:33.977 --> 00:23:36.038]  Oh, I will, Non-X-Man.
[00:23:36.179 --> 00:23:38.840]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[00:23:41.016 --> 00:23:43.639]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.584]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[00:23:48.124 --> 00:23:59.257]  It's in the foot care aisle at Super Setters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.000]  Don't worry.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.021]  This show is documented.
[00:24:07.481 --> 00:24:10.782]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:12.122 --> 00:24:15.963]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:16.123 --> 00:24:19.404]  Crashing from lies and disinformation.
[00:24:19.684 --> 00:24:21.524]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central.
[00:24:21.544 --> 00:24:24.485]  Don't forget the free podcast at m4awards.com.
[00:24:24.505 --> 00:24:26.405]  Listen to the show how you want, when you want.

[00:24:31.758 --> 00:24:33.860]  Okay, we're about to go straight to your calls.
[00:24:34.981 --> 00:24:43.488]  Saturday night I was here at the office at about 7.30 and we took about a 15 minute break to eat some Italian food we ordered in.
[00:24:43.508 --> 00:24:46.811]  And we turn on the computer.
[00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:48.352]  Talk about technology.
[00:24:48.372 --> 00:24:49.714]  Well, I'm going to tell this story later.
[00:24:50.775 --> 00:24:52.136]  It has to do with Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:24:52.236 --> 00:24:53.557]  Man, talk about something else.
[00:24:55.719 --> 00:24:58.081]  Let's go ahead and go to Kenny in New York.
[00:24:58.121 --> 00:24:58.882]  Kenny, you're on the air.
[00:24:58.922 --> 00:24:59.282]  Go ahead.
[00:24:59.926 --> 00:25:00.726]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:25:01.027 --> 00:25:01.887]  Good, thank you for calling.
[00:25:01.907 --> 00:25:09.311]  I heard that interview with the Rothschild guy, that piece of scum, and I gotta say, you did a good job.
[00:25:10.872 --> 00:25:11.913]  You did a real good job.
[00:25:12.533 --> 00:25:20.458]  Well, thank you, but I mean, did you hear him when I pointed out that the ice caps are melting and the seas are melting all over the... I heard how he tried to spin the planet thing.
[00:25:20.718 --> 00:25:21.298]  He knew that.
[00:25:21.819 --> 00:25:22.139]  He knew.
[00:25:22.179 --> 00:25:23.219]  He thought we were stupid.
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:24.400]  You know?
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.442]  And I just want to tell them, I know there's some New World Order people
[00:25:27.918 --> 00:25:30.298]  Listen now, and I'm going to tell you that I HATE YOU!
[00:25:30.859 --> 00:25:32.979]  Alright, I hear you Kenny, Kenny, I understand.
[00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:34.579]  That's good.
[00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:39.260]  It's good to get a little bit angry there, but it might interact with me.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:44.441]  It might get me too excited, so we've got to... Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Texas.
[00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:45.341]  Steve, you're on the air.
[00:25:45.381 --> 00:25:45.721]  Welcome.
[00:25:46.461 --> 00:25:47.541]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:25:47.821 --> 00:25:48.161]  Good, sir.
[00:25:48.181 --> 00:25:48.481]  Welcome.
[00:25:49.282 --> 00:25:53.482]  Alright, I was going to ask you, I basically have like two questions here.
[00:25:53.502 --> 00:25:56.603]  Number one, like, how possible do you think it is for
[00:25:57.714 --> 00:26:07.223]  Bush to prolong his term by, like, a third term, or, you know, possibly try to, like, dissolve all kind of checks and balances on his office.
[00:26:07.783 --> 00:26:09.244]  Like, how possible do you think that is?
[00:26:09.785 --> 00:26:15.370]  Well, that's really a two-parter, because the question is, has he dissolved checks and balances?
[00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:21.395]  Has he gone further than any president in the last hundred-plus years since the Civil War to
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:31.250]  Openly eviscerate the Bill of Rights and Constitution and create whole new bodies of Neo-Napoleonic Law.
[00:26:33.162 --> 00:26:47.366]  And the answer is he has butchered the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, the heart and soul of the United States from pillar to post, up one side and down the other, all points of the compass.
[00:26:47.526 --> 00:26:48.586]  It's indescribable.
[00:26:49.066 --> 00:26:51.367]  There is a counterbalance swing against it.
[00:26:51.447 --> 00:26:52.987]  I don't know how successful it's going to be.
[00:26:53.387 --> 00:26:56.488]  It's somewhat successful just in its first initial phases.
[00:26:58.454 --> 00:27:06.058]  To try to reverse that, but the establishment is just pouring on more fuel, trying to drive over us right now.
[00:27:06.098 --> 00:27:07.799]  So there's a real fight that's been joined.
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:15.904]  As for staying in office, I would say there's about a 20% chance that Bush will set off nukes and go full-bore Hitler.
[00:27:16.524 --> 00:27:20.426]  Maybe even a higher chance, but I think the elites may not let him because they see we're not buying it.
[00:27:20.866 --> 00:27:25.069]  And then they would rather just take the gains, the precedent set, the illegal and lawful
[00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:42.113]  Un-American, traitorous, treacherous, larcenous steps that have been gained in the last six years, and then just pass those on to Hillary, and then have events then, or Obama, and then let the power just be incrementally brought in.
[00:27:42.793 --> 00:27:49.915]  Bush was given the baton in this relay race to see how far he could go.
[00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:52.676]  They definitely took the leash off.
[00:27:53.297 --> 00:27:56.158]  of this current crop and said, OK, you can take the blame if you fail.
[00:27:56.498 --> 00:27:57.358]  Go hog wild!
[00:27:57.838 --> 00:27:58.598]  And they haven't failed.
[00:27:58.618 --> 00:28:00.699]  They butchered much of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:28:01.579 --> 00:28:04.260]  They have invaded two countries.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.560]  They're set to invade a third.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.281]  They have demonized the name of the U.S.
[00:28:08.441 --> 00:28:09.541]  wonderfully worldwide.
[00:28:09.881 --> 00:28:17.143]  They've set up permanent bases in the heart of the Middle East for the next phase to destabilize Saudi Arabia.
[00:28:17.183 --> 00:28:18.023]  That's the real target.
[00:28:19.012 --> 00:28:19.873]  One of the key targets.
[00:28:20.553 --> 00:28:23.796]  And so Bush has done just an unbelievable job.
[00:28:23.836 --> 00:28:24.216]  Believe me.
[00:28:24.416 --> 00:28:26.257]  He'll be getting lots of secret awards.
[00:28:26.738 --> 00:28:28.119]  Lots of little secret parties.
[00:28:28.159 --> 00:28:29.960]  They'll be toasting his father.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.882]  They kicked it off yesterday at the Bohemian Grove.
[00:28:33.642 --> 00:28:35.023]  Ongoing in Northern California.
[00:28:35.924 --> 00:28:40.407]  He'll be getting some serious... Bush has done an incredible job.
[00:28:40.467 --> 00:28:41.008]  Precision.
[00:28:41.568 --> 00:28:42.369]  Total precision.
[00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:43.870]  I mean, that is his handlers.
[00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:47.172]  Those behind him have brought us to the brink of total annihilation.
[00:28:47.959 --> 00:28:53.903]  And total martial law, but he'll probably just pass the baton on, and then he'll be rehabilitated in the media.
[00:28:55.363 --> 00:29:09.031]  And, oh, how right, Bush was so right, he tried to protect us, and then, why, in 2009 the nukes went off, and right when Hillary came in, man, they would have listened to Bush, but she sure stood up as a woman and showed leadership, proving a woman can do it.
[00:29:09.291 --> 00:29:11.593]  Well, you know, it's a lot like Margaret Thatcher in the
[00:29:12.583 --> 00:29:14.425]  You know, and what happened in the Falcons, yes.
[00:29:14.765 --> 00:29:16.787]  Women in history have done very well in war.
[00:29:17.007 --> 00:29:19.089]  They'll have lots of TV specials on that.
[00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.210]  You'll be watching it.
[00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:21.371]  You'll wonder how I knew at the time.
[00:29:21.411 --> 00:29:22.252]  I just studied the enemy.
[00:29:22.973 --> 00:29:26.076]  And, uh, it'll, it'll, it'll, it'll just, just be continual.
[00:29:26.696 --> 00:29:27.177]  Anything else?
[00:29:28.255 --> 00:29:32.898]  Uh, yeah, I was gonna ask you basically about another conspiracy right now.
[00:29:32.978 --> 00:29:37.720]  Like, I don't believe in it personally, but, like, the whole Reptoid thing, like, what do you think of that?
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:42.262]  I mean, I don't... Sure, I'll comment on that and rumple stillskin on the other side.
[00:29:42.703 --> 00:29:44.243]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:44.604 --> 00:29:45.644]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:45.724 --> 00:29:47.985]  PrisonPlanet.tv's the website.
[00:29:51.647 --> 00:29:52.568]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.048 --> 00:29:54.549]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.548 --> 00:29:58.236]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.621 --> 00:30:07.743]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:30:07.963 --> 00:30:09.724]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:30:10.005 --> 00:30:16.288]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:30:16.568 --> 00:30:22.691]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:30:22.952 --> 00:30:28.975]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[00:30:29.255 --> 00:30:35.661]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[00:30:35.821 --> 00:30:39.365]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[00:30:39.665 --> 00:30:43.368]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[00:30:43.548 --> 00:30:46.091]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:30:46.231 --> 00:30:47.272]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:30:47.552 --> 00:30:48.053]  I think so.
[00:31:02.384 --> 00:31:03.605]  This is Elizabeth Border.
[00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:04.827]  News alert!

[00:31:11.834 --> 00:31:14.738]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[00:31:15.118 --> 00:31:16.319]  War in Iran?
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.482]  A coming One World Church?
[00:31:19.242 --> 00:31:24.546]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[00:32:01.767 --> 00:32:04.268]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:32:04.928 --> 00:32:07.848]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts No.
[00:32:07.868 --> 00:32:13.530]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:19.451]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[00:32:20.511 --> 00:32:22.332]  This is minimum infringement.
[00:32:22.712 --> 00:32:23.512]  There may be more.
[00:32:24.697 --> 00:32:31.503]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[00:32:32.183 --> 00:32:40.030]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:42.432]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:32:42.452 --> 00:32:42.772]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:58.471]  Call now, our operators are standing by to take your order.
[00:33:01.792 --> 00:33:13.716]  Don't forget my friends, my new film, Terror Storm, is now out.
[00:33:24.896 --> 00:33:31.640]  17 minutes of added video, added analysis on the controlled demolition of Building 7 with the BBC.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:39.644]  Reporting 20 plus minutes before it fell, that it had fallen, putting out the official line, even how it had fallen, why it fell.
[00:33:39.664 --> 00:33:43.586]  Because they knew people would have questions, so they told the cattle.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:52.508]  Then seeing it in an hour before saying it with Aaron Brown, that's just 4 or 5 minutes, or actually about 3 minutes of the 17 minutes of added information.
[00:33:52.588 --> 00:33:56.972]  It's just an amazing documentary, was an amazing documentary, now even more powerful.
[00:33:57.413 --> 00:34:07.023]  And that DVD, what, 3 hours and 15 minutes, that would be 3 hours and 20 minutes of footage now total on one DVD.
[00:34:08.144 --> 00:34:10.666]  Over a two-hour film and then 68 minutes of extras.
[00:34:11.066 --> 00:34:13.348]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:34:13.808 --> 00:34:24.276]  Special edition, now shipping, now available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:34:24.577 --> 00:34:27.279]  We added more graphics because what happened is we had to rush it out.
[00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:31.582]  And so graphics that our graphics guy had finished, it was too late for us to put them in.
[00:34:32.002 --> 00:34:35.465]  Music that had been done, we didn't have time to put it in, some of it.
[00:34:36.225 --> 00:34:40.348]  Other video images, other documents we wanted to add, we put those in, but that doesn't count.
[00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:42.590]  There's 17 minutes of totally new film.
[00:34:43.911 --> 00:34:44.532]  New sections.
[00:34:44.892 --> 00:34:49.655]  And then we went back to the whole film, added audio, remixed audio, redid a lot of stuff.
[00:34:49.675 --> 00:34:59.743]  It was already excellent, but it's just, it's a different film now, and if you like Terror Storm, you found it to be effective in waking people up, you can order your DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:01.644 --> 00:35:03.465]  And don't forget PrismPlanet.tv.
[00:35:03.485 --> 00:35:09.409]  We now just don't have it in high quality and medium and low quality download, depending on your connection speed.
[00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:11.631]  We have it in three different formats that way.
[00:35:12.051 --> 00:35:13.792]  We also have two different flash formats.
[00:35:14.012 --> 00:35:16.134]  High bandwidth, broadband, and then medium band.
[00:35:16.938 --> 00:35:17.378]  I don't know.
[00:35:38.032 --> 00:35:40.933]  And I'm going to be taking some of my older films that were uploaded a few years ago.
[00:35:40.993 --> 00:35:45.213]  They're decent quality, but we're going to be re-encoding those in the higher quality as well.
[00:35:45.653 --> 00:35:52.014]  So it's up there for download in Windows and in the Mac format as well.
[00:35:53.395 --> 00:35:57.555]  And it is also now in two different Flash formats for you.
[00:35:58.496 --> 00:36:01.556]  The new Terror Storm, and you can burn them right to disk.
[00:36:01.596 --> 00:36:05.017]  You can go get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[00:36:05.357 --> 00:36:06.137]  And I want you
[00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:10.551]  For those of you that have a little bit of computer savvy, it's very easy to do.
[00:36:10.591 --> 00:36:18.375]  If you don't, just go search on the web for the different free converters that, once you've downloaded it, so you can burn it to disk.
[00:36:18.415 --> 00:36:19.375]  It's very easy to do.
[00:36:19.996 --> 00:36:22.437]  And just aggressively, buy aggressively.
[00:36:22.737 --> 00:36:23.777]  Make a few copies a day.
[00:36:23.797 --> 00:36:33.082]  Just when you're surfing the web, oh, let me go to the site and burn another copy of Terror Storm and then give that to your neighbors, your friends, police officers, your pastor.
[00:36:34.002 --> 00:36:35.002]  Give it to your professor.
[00:36:35.042 --> 00:36:36.183]  Give it to your school teacher.
[00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:40.030]  And just say, hey, this is some pretty controversial stuff.
[00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:42.311]  Tell me what you think of it.
[00:36:43.511 --> 00:36:51.374]  This film has been watched more than 7 million times on Google and YouTube alone, and then here's a new edition of it.
[00:36:51.414 --> 00:36:52.295]  Tell me what you think.
[00:36:52.395 --> 00:36:53.315]  I want your opinion.
[00:36:55.216 --> 00:37:03.779]  You know, that way, if it's your friend or neighbor, they won't think you're a devil-worshipping heretic if they watch it and don't agree with the information.
[00:37:04.952 --> 00:37:11.357]  It won't matter, because later down the line, it's the truth, it's going to seep in, and later down the line, they're going to wake up.
[00:37:12.398 --> 00:37:14.520]  We've almost got a 100% conversion rate.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:21.285]  The truth is powerful, powerful medicine, so get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[00:37:23.223 --> 00:37:24.304]  Monthly membership for $5.95.
[00:37:24.504 --> 00:37:27.688]  That's the cost of two and a half cups of Starbucks coffee.

[00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:30.971]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:31.031 --> 00:37:32.012]  Okay, I said calls.
[00:37:32.052 --> 00:37:32.653]  I'm taking calls.
[00:37:33.394 --> 00:37:35.536]  Let's go ahead and talk to Diane in California.
[00:37:35.556 --> 00:37:36.497]  Diane, you're on the air.
[00:37:36.517 --> 00:37:37.718]  Hey Alex!
[00:37:38.139 --> 00:37:38.379]  Hi!
[00:37:38.399 --> 00:37:39.880]  It's good to talk to you.
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.244]  This is regarding your film, Endgame.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:38:00.308]  And I know that you have a large area to cover in eugenics, but I'm just wondering if you're going to mention anything about the drug that Eli Lilly distributed about 50 years ago, the DES drug, to keep women from having miscarriages.
[00:38:00.368 --> 00:38:02.029]  It was a hormone, estrogen?
[00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:07.872]  I have briefly read about that, but I don't really know the details.
[00:38:07.912 --> 00:38:08.372]  Fill me in.
[00:38:09.197 --> 00:38:20.806]  Well, it's been proven that women have been coming down like 40, 50 years later with clear cell cancer, cancer in the breast and the uterus.
[00:38:20.866 --> 00:38:22.807]  You haven't heard of that?
[00:38:22.827 --> 00:38:23.768]  Well, we know this.
[00:38:24.448 --> 00:38:29.352]  Many forms of birth control are clearly correlated, not just related.
[00:38:29.392 --> 00:38:30.273]  There's not just a link.
[00:38:30.733 --> 00:38:37.178]  Conclusively, they know that birth control, the hormonal suppression of the menstrual cycle,
[00:38:38.548 --> 00:38:45.153]  Massively increases many forms of the different hormone-related cancers.
[00:38:45.574 --> 00:38:45.894]  Right.
[00:38:46.214 --> 00:38:52.820]  Well, Eli Lilly knew that it had caused cancer in laboratory rats and still distributed it.
[00:38:53.541 --> 00:38:54.601]  Well, here's the problem.
[00:38:56.983 --> 00:38:57.644]  That's what happened.
[00:38:57.664 --> 00:39:00.767]  The film was about 90 minutes long.
[00:39:01.654 --> 00:39:13.164]  And then I got up to the end to make the eugenics section and thought I'd just make it 15-20 minutes long, and just to like a machine gun list, okay, they murdered these children in foster care with pesticide.
[00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:15.146]  Here's AP and video of it.
[00:39:15.926 --> 00:39:19.830]  They gave these women uranium injections and these women plutonium pills.
[00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:21.411]  Okay, they did this.
[00:39:21.951 --> 00:39:29.618]  I mean, just rapid fire, there's like 10 minutes of that, and I literally didn't put one one hundredth of what we know in there.
[00:39:30.038 --> 00:39:33.640]  That's the frustration of this, and tell me the name of the drug?
[00:39:36.241 --> 00:39:41.224]  The abbreviation is DES, but it's called D-I-B-E-S-T-R-A-L.
[00:39:42.684 --> 00:39:44.325]  I can't even pronounce it, it's such a long word.
[00:39:44.685 --> 00:39:45.826]  Well, I'll look into it.
[00:39:45.866 --> 00:39:58.452]  It causes like a clear cell cancer, adenocarcinoma, and my mother had taken that drug, and I personally, from my own experience, I have had so many problems with my cycles.
[00:39:59.305 --> 00:40:03.468]  And I just want to tell women out there that you need to change your diet.
[00:40:04.408 --> 00:40:05.509]  Nothing with hormones.
[00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:06.970]  No meat, eggs, or butter.
[00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:07.831]  You know?
[00:40:08.071 --> 00:40:10.032]  And then you'll have a better time of it.
[00:40:10.512 --> 00:40:10.812]  All right.
[00:40:10.832 --> 00:40:12.193]  Well, thank you so much for the call.
[00:40:12.233 --> 00:40:13.054]  And I'll check into that.
[00:40:13.094 --> 00:40:13.554]  Thank you.
[00:40:14.355 --> 00:40:16.696]  Yes, anything you think should be added in the film.
[00:40:16.716 --> 00:40:17.217]  Anything.
[00:40:17.417 --> 00:40:17.997]  Right down here.
[00:40:18.037 --> 00:40:19.238]  I mean, I got picture locked.
[00:40:19.638 --> 00:40:21.319]  I was supposed to have picture locked yesterday.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.822]  And, of course, now we're not going to have picture locked.
[00:40:26.658 --> 00:40:26.938]  I don't know.
[00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:53.389]  You know, just get frustrated because it's just, you keep your head in this stuff all the time.
[00:40:53.449 --> 00:40:57.712]  It doesn't make Jack a dull boy, it makes Jack a very aggressive, mean boy.
[00:41:02.234 --> 00:41:06.297]  But again, the film, everybody thinks the film, Wikipedia says it's coming out in August, I never said that.
[00:41:08.278 --> 00:41:14.302]  By the way, Wikipedia's got my name spelled wrong, it's not, the Emmerich spelling is wrong, but that doesn't matter.
[00:41:14.322 --> 00:41:14.883]  Side issue,
[00:41:15.996 --> 00:41:19.297]  I'm getting all these emails going, we hear it's out in August because Wikipedia says it.
[00:41:19.398 --> 00:41:27.361]  No, what I said is in August I am sending it to the manufacturer and the distributor for mass production.
[00:41:27.381 --> 00:41:28.982]  It won't come out until October.
[00:41:32.023 --> 00:41:35.605]  Alright, and this is how it works.
[00:41:35.645 --> 00:41:36.645]  I get picture lock.
[00:41:37.826 --> 00:41:42.027]  That means the credits are done, the basic film is done, and I'm going to go back into it.
[00:41:43.228 --> 00:41:45.469]  Well, picture lock isn't even really picture lock until you cut it.
[00:41:47.305 --> 00:41:48.905]  So I've got to go in and cut, too.
[00:41:48.925 --> 00:41:50.486]  I'm going to go in and watch it again and cut.
[00:41:50.506 --> 00:41:51.646]  We've already cut several times.
[00:41:52.046 --> 00:41:53.486]  I've got to cut down some areas.
[00:41:53.526 --> 00:41:56.747]  I'll probably cut down the Trans-Texas, Napa Superhighways area.
[00:41:56.767 --> 00:42:01.627]  Because as bad as that is when you're watching it, once you get to eugenics, it doesn't even matter, folks.
[00:42:01.707 --> 00:42:08.229]  I mean, in comparison, it's just... And I don't know why I'm getting off into all this right now.
[00:42:08.249 --> 00:42:09.089]  I might as well talk about it.
[00:42:09.149 --> 00:42:09.689]  It's interesting.
[00:42:13.649 --> 00:42:16.410]  And then I've got to go in and add graphics that have been done.
[00:42:17.512 --> 00:42:19.433]  We've already added graphics into the first hour.
[00:42:19.453 --> 00:42:21.755]  Then we've got the graphics aren't done for the second hour yet.
[00:42:22.155 --> 00:42:23.436]  The second hour isn't even complete.
[00:42:23.877 --> 00:42:25.318]  We've got a race to get those in.
[00:42:25.978 --> 00:42:29.941]  I've got 20 tracks of music Graham Reynolds has made for me.
[00:42:30.261 --> 00:42:32.103]  He's allowing me to use his old library.
[00:42:32.123 --> 00:42:33.964]  The Golden Arm Trio is done.
[00:42:33.984 --> 00:42:35.926]  So I've got to try to figure out what I want to do with that.
[00:42:36.426 --> 00:42:37.387]  It's a labor of love.
[00:42:37.987 --> 00:42:39.949]  All this great music, where to put it, how to use it.
[00:42:40.009 --> 00:42:45.713]  So we've got to do all that and have it to the distributor.
[00:42:46.673 --> 00:42:48.134]  By mid-August.
[00:42:49.554 --> 00:42:56.898]  And that's contractual, too, so I'm, uh... And then, of course, it's a powerful film, so you want to make it as powerful as possible.
[00:42:58.879 --> 00:43:00.719]  You want to make it as good as you can.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.981]  But, I mean, it's three people making this film.
[00:43:06.842 --> 00:43:08.163]  You know, in here doing the main work.
[00:43:08.343 --> 00:43:14.426]  Aaron Dykes, of course, but the main person is Rob Jacobson, the main editor, but Aaron's working 14, 16 hours a day.
[00:43:16.201 --> 00:43:20.703]  And then myself, and then Graham Reynolds, and of course some of the graphics people have done a great job.
[00:43:22.704 --> 00:43:24.365]  McWhorter, and of course Glenn.
[00:43:26.966 --> 00:43:30.687]  So we're trying to integrate all this together, and we're trying to put the most important info in.
[00:43:31.288 --> 00:43:34.489]  I mean, I literally could have a 500 hour audio book.
[00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:35.790]  500 hours, no problem.
[00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:43.233]  Just with quotes about the elite talking about how they're going to kill everybody, and how they hate us, and how we're scum, and how we're sheep, and ha ha ha.
[00:43:44.094 --> 00:43:52.862]  And how they're supermen, and how they're already a new species, but they're going to be a clear, distinct species that can't even breed from us.
[00:43:54.083 --> 00:43:58.887]  I mean, this film is two hours long, and I haven't even gotten into the whole global tax, global warming hoax.
[00:43:59.287 --> 00:44:00.909]  I've got to keep that down to about three minutes.
[00:44:01.369 --> 00:44:04.432]  Then I want to get into the post-humanist Kurzwellian system.
[00:44:05.553 --> 00:44:07.114]  I'll have to keep that down to about three minutes.
[00:44:07.154 --> 00:44:09.516]  I'm just going to make Endgame 2, I've decided.
[00:44:10.279 --> 00:44:11.579]  There will be another endgame.
[00:44:11.619 --> 00:44:16.320]  You can set your watch and warrant by that, unless I'm dying in a car wreck or something else.
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.221]  God forbid, I really want to finish my work.
[00:44:19.341 --> 00:44:22.382]  All I ask, I never ask God for anything, except God's will be done.
[00:44:22.402 --> 00:44:28.283]  But I do, selfishly, because I'm in love with my work, ask God, just let me live long enough to complete my work.
[00:44:28.323 --> 00:44:32.264]  Of course, there's always some new work I want to do, some new thing I want to complete.
[00:44:34.344 --> 00:44:37.425]  I get mad at myself for my safety, because I don't even think about my safety.
[00:44:38.112 --> 00:44:38.572]  I don't think so.
[00:44:55.882 --> 00:45:01.304]  Quandary for me, because I want to support them, but then I have to ask myself, how do I best support the Browns?
[00:45:01.344 --> 00:45:05.145]  And how do I best get the word out about the fraudulent nature of the income tax?
[00:45:05.185 --> 00:45:08.506]  And how do I best not steer my audience wrong?
[00:45:12.027 --> 00:45:25.332]  And I think, man, a party up there at Plainfield, will that antagonize the Feds and make them want to come in?
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.781]  And I really couldn't analyze it properly.
[00:45:29.241 --> 00:45:36.403]  You can analyze big systems because you've got enough history, enough time, enough blueprints to know the basic agenda.
[00:45:37.003 --> 00:45:46.846]  But when you get into specifics with more limited numbers of people, you'd think it'd be more simple to analyze what would happen, but it actually becomes harder in many respects.
[00:45:47.806 --> 00:45:55.568]  Because predictability in large masses, kind of schools of fish, I don't know how to describe this, I can just organically analyze it.
[00:45:56.972 --> 00:46:24.772]  is easier than individual actions and I'm I don't know what the feds are up to we have we do have their past actions uh... and so I did promote the event some I you know I some people are like well you know don't don't make a big deal about the helicopters and jets flying over and one group of people are telling me they're military others are saying they aren't I saw the video folks it's on land security I've now seen it and it's uh...
[00:46:26.448 --> 00:46:31.552]  And, uh, you know, hey, there's people creeping around in the woods, but let's not make a big deal about it.
[00:46:32.053 --> 00:46:52.589]  And I morally was kind of like, well, we better mention this, just so people know when they're going up there that this isn't, you know, this isn't tiddlywinks, this isn't patty cake, patty cake, baker's man, roll them up, roll them up, throw them in the pan, you know, poke them and prick them and mark them with a B and put them in the oven for baby and me.
[00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:55.371]  I mean, this is, this is, this is the new old order.
[00:46:57.336 --> 00:47:00.398]  As Hitler said, we do not play at war.
[00:47:00.478 --> 00:47:02.660]  The New World Order does not play at this stuff.
[00:47:03.781 --> 00:47:05.642]  And that's why I've been trying to de-escalate things.
[00:47:05.702 --> 00:47:07.843]  I don't want the Browns to be assaulted.
[00:47:08.344 --> 00:47:13.307]  I don't want a bunch of Feds who mean nothing to the New World Order to get killed and to start some new escalation.
[00:47:13.848 --> 00:47:16.149]  I want to be cool like Fonzie.
[00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:18.571]  Let's be like Fonzie.
[00:47:18.911 --> 00:47:19.572]  How's Fonzie?
[00:47:19.612 --> 00:47:20.152]  He's cool.
[00:47:20.532 --> 00:47:21.353]  Not that I am cool.
[00:47:22.401 --> 00:47:32.847]  I can rant and rave in my passion to try to get you to wake up and move, but at the same time I'm very cool when it actually comes to a situation.
[00:47:32.867 --> 00:47:43.814]  So I had that quandary, and I dialed in on an internet feed that was on the We Are Change site.
[00:47:43.834 --> 00:47:48.117]  I think they had a link over to Davon Kleist who had one up there.
[00:47:48.137 --> 00:47:52.059]  I'm not sure exactly, I was trying to figure out where the feed was coming from, but it was a link on We Are Change.
[00:47:53.539 --> 00:47:56.140]  And I heard Dave on the radio talking about it, so I would guess that was his feed.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:56.900]  I'm glad he did that.
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:02.641]  But I'm sitting there watching it, and we're sitting there listening to the music and stuff, going, oh great, glad things went well.
[00:48:03.121 --> 00:48:04.461]  Looks like about 100 people there.
[00:48:04.982 --> 00:48:13.984]  They were doing wide camera shots out of the barn, and then zooming back in, somebody was operating a camera off a wireless feed, and I'm going, oh that's great, I'm glad it went well.
[00:48:14.404 --> 00:48:15.644]  Man, I had a bad feeling about it.
[00:48:17.188 --> 00:48:22.431]  And all of a sudden, this helicopter about 100 yards away comes up and I'm like, oh my gosh.
[00:48:22.811 --> 00:48:27.694]  That's the helicopters I've seen with Homeland Security a hundred times in AP photos and video.
[00:48:28.134 --> 00:48:30.855]  It was the grey Homeland Security, they have grey and black ones.
[00:48:30.875 --> 00:48:34.357]  It was like a $20 million German helicopter.
[00:48:35.098 --> 00:48:36.938]  I've looked up the model number before I have it in front of me.
[00:48:37.279 --> 00:48:43.582]  We did run the tail number off the video and then they were suddenly announcing that it was Homeland Security that supposedly had already been there.
[00:48:43.762 --> 00:48:45.363]  And they had already run it on the internet.
[00:48:46.432 --> 00:48:51.038]  And, uh, it was a federal helicopter, and it was clearly trying to start a provocation.
[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:57.427]  It was, uh... And then once it got dark, you could see it flying right over him.
[00:48:58.128 --> 00:48:59.470]  And it was flying at about...
[00:49:03.296 --> 00:49:13.142]  75 feet, then it went down to about 50, then it went down behind trees at about 100 yards away, I'd say it was probably 10 feet off the ground, it may have even landed for all I know.
[00:49:13.502 --> 00:49:17.224]  It goes down behind what looked like oak trees or no more than 50 feet tall.
[00:49:18.725 --> 00:49:22.928]  It's flying around at dangerous altitudes, then at about 9 o'clock central,
[00:49:24.847 --> 00:49:26.949]  It turns its lights off and the feed goes dead.
[00:49:27.429 --> 00:49:29.711]  So I made some calls and they said, no, no, it's still flying around.
[00:49:29.731 --> 00:49:32.553]  And basically it flew off refueling and flew around all night.
[00:49:33.334 --> 00:49:45.544]  So you've got the feds trying to get somebody to shoot fireworks at them, trying to get somebody, which it was just ongoing.
[00:49:45.744 --> 00:49:48.126]  And I guarantee you that's what they were trying to do.
[00:49:48.166 --> 00:49:49.908]  They wanted to move in on those people.
[00:49:51.029 --> 00:49:52.470]  I mean, why else would they do that?
[00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:53.811]  I mean, that is so childish.
[00:49:54.446 --> 00:50:05.008]  To try to escalate this and try to let everybody know, we're in control, we're the federal government, we can engage in a PSYOP, we can fly over you, we can do whatever we want.
[00:50:05.028 --> 00:50:13.770]  I mean literally, they released over 400,000 aggravated felons in Houston alone in 2005.
[00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:19.491]  That was on the cover of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:50:22.368 --> 00:50:23.528]  It was 400,000 and something.
[00:50:23.548 --> 00:50:24.429]  I forget the exact number.
[00:50:24.449 --> 00:50:25.869]  I remember seeing the number and I couldn't believe it.
[00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:29.210]  So I did more searches and you remember I talked about it for like a week on air.
[00:50:31.111 --> 00:50:33.552]  And it just... In fact, I know Tim's in there listening to the show.
[00:50:33.812 --> 00:50:38.093]  Tim, why don't you go Google that so I can make sure of that number.
[00:50:38.434 --> 00:50:40.994]  So, I mean, we've got illegal aliens and felons running all over us.
[00:50:42.015 --> 00:50:43.935]  There's trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[00:50:46.716 --> 00:50:51.538]  And they've got time to have the Fed surrounding an older couple
[00:50:52.361 --> 00:50:55.203]  They're having a barbecue on their land with Homeland Security helicopters.
[00:50:55.663 --> 00:51:02.308]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.408 --> 00:51:10.333]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.694 --> 00:51:18.319]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.033 --> 00:51:26.077]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.477 --> 00:51:37.903]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.223 --> 00:51:41.805]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.186 --> 00:51:44.147]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.447 --> 00:51:48.289]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:01.408 --> 00:53:04.329]  Where do you think one of the most toxic places on earth is?
[00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:05.870]  The answer may surprise you.
[00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:07.031]  It's in your body.
[00:53:07.291 --> 00:53:11.133]  The colon is a natural breeding ground for disease-producing germs.
[00:53:11.393 --> 00:53:15.515]  It may not sound like a very appealing subject, but it should not go ignored.
[00:53:15.675 --> 00:53:22.858]  For over a decade now, natural health expert Dr. Lauren Ritter has educated people everywhere about the benefits of internal cleansing.
[00:53:23.098 --> 00:53:29.880]  Now these benefits include higher energy levels, more comfortable digestion, high immune support, and healthier looking skin.

[00:53:39.682 --> 00:53:42.362]  Don't let your body be the most toxic place on earth.

[00:53:48.984 --> 00:53:49.204]  Call now.
[00:54:07.392 --> 00:54:10.033]  But just another side point on technology.
[00:54:10.073 --> 00:54:12.853]  We take for granted the revolutions that are happening.
[00:54:12.873 --> 00:54:15.574]  I mean we could just sit there while we were editing
[00:54:37.706 --> 00:54:52.919]  And they're eating Italian food and just dial into a computer and pull up a live shot of a demonstration, rock concert, whatever you want to call it, in the middle of the countryside in New Hampshire.
[00:54:56.041 --> 00:54:57.883]  And the police are starting to figure this out.
[00:54:57.923 --> 00:55:06.930]  Everybody's got these wireless hookups at demonstrations and they're sending them back to websites or back to YouTube type services that are popping up everywhere.
[00:55:07.893 --> 00:55:13.794]  I mean, the New World Order can try all day to now tell us you can't videotape us, but we're going to put cameras everywhere videotaping you.
[00:55:13.854 --> 00:55:14.695]  It's not going to work.
[00:55:17.235 --> 00:55:18.256]  It is not going to work.
[00:55:19.696 --> 00:55:24.057]  And that's why they're racing to go ahead and bring in the martial law now.
[00:55:24.537 --> 00:55:25.297]  And I may be wrong.
[00:55:25.817 --> 00:55:28.098]  Bush may stay in office, they may just go into martial law.
[00:55:28.718 --> 00:55:32.439]  You cannot say that it isn't a serious possibility
[00:55:33.306 --> 00:55:35.007]  Because they've made the preparations.
[00:55:35.027 --> 00:55:37.229]  The preparatory moves have been made.
[00:55:37.289 --> 00:55:38.470]  The funding has been put in.
[00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:39.791]  It's openly been announced.
[00:55:40.872 --> 00:55:42.853]  And they've put trial balloons out about this.
[00:55:42.933 --> 00:55:43.814]  This may be coming.
[00:55:44.814 --> 00:55:46.456]  This is now a mainstream topic.
[00:55:47.356 --> 00:55:54.041]  It's not just things relocated to that crazy young man, Alex Jones, in the mid-1990s.
[00:55:56.337 --> 00:56:00.978]  Let's go to Dylan, Trina, Rob, Tony, Kathy, and others.
[00:56:01.398 --> 00:56:03.439]  You're on the air, Dylan, from Texas.
[00:56:04.239 --> 00:56:05.159]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[00:56:05.179 --> 00:56:05.500]  Good, sir.
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:05.880]  Go ahead.
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:07.240]  Alright, cool.
[00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:09.001]  Yeah, I also saw Endgame.
[00:56:09.021 --> 00:56:10.561]  I want to say I thought it was great so far.
[00:56:10.641 --> 00:56:12.922]  I know it's a bit challenging.
[00:56:12.962 --> 00:56:14.302]  I probably condensed it to two hours.
[00:56:14.322 --> 00:56:16.963]  You mean you saw that first hour of Endgame, that sneak peek we did?
[00:56:17.583 --> 00:56:18.083]  Yes, I did.
[00:56:18.763 --> 00:56:20.564]  Yeah, I thought it was great.
[00:56:20.644 --> 00:56:21.384]  Well, thanks for coming.
[00:56:21.992 --> 00:56:23.213]  Yeah, man, this is a good time.
[00:56:23.493 --> 00:56:26.215]  I wanted to ask you if you'd seen a documentary from 1972.
[00:56:26.335 --> 00:56:33.179]  It came on TV, and it was also made for a UN conference called Survival of Spaceship Earth.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.221]  No, I haven't.
[00:56:37.101 --> 00:56:43.826]  Okay, well, I want to really tell you about this, because if you can get your hands on this, this might be something potentially good for research for Endgame.
[00:56:44.526 --> 00:56:50.630]  John D. Rockefeller III is in it, and I just wanted to quickly, if I could, read the synopsis to you, because I think you'll
[00:56:51.565 --> 00:56:54.067]  It's called Survival of Spaceship Earth.
[00:56:54.547 --> 00:56:56.429]  Yes, yes, and can I read the synopsis to you?
[00:56:56.449 --> 00:56:56.909]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:56:57.430 --> 00:57:04.255]  Okay, Earth's environmental crisis brought about by uncontrolled technological progress is endangering life on a global scale.
[00:57:04.715 --> 00:57:15.824]  At the core of the threats to the planet, wars, overpopulation, pollution, and the depletion of natural resources is the inadequacy of the nation-state to come to terms with the surmounting problems of 20th century living.
[00:57:16.284 --> 00:57:20.167]  What is urgently needed is the kind of international cooperation where the nation-states
[00:57:20.598 --> 00:57:25.262]  Relinquish part of their sovereignty to a world body entrusted with management of mankind's future.
[00:57:27.143 --> 00:57:39.973]  But then, oh by the way, we found quotes of Bush at the Summit in 2005 where he called it the American Union, but then all these neocon sites are saying we're crazy, it doesn't exist.
[00:57:40.013 --> 00:57:40.814]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[00:57:40.854 --> 00:57:45.217]  There's hundreds of films, thousands of books, thousands and thousands of quotes.
[00:57:45.898 --> 00:57:47.459]  They're just, that's all they talk about.
[00:57:48.187 --> 00:57:50.709]  And then you tell the general public and they say it doesn't exist.
[00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:55.173]  You know, I will definitely, if somebody has a copy of that film, rush it to us.
[00:57:55.753 --> 00:57:59.556]  We might be able to, you know, do an analysis of it, certainly play some clips here.
[00:57:59.916 --> 00:58:02.579]  We'll try to order it or get it off eBay or something.
[00:58:03.239 --> 00:58:09.504]  But thank you, again, it's you guys and gals that help us with this data, so thank you so much.
[00:58:09.824 --> 00:58:10.565]  Anything else, Dylan?
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.881]  Uh, no, not really.
[00:58:12.921 --> 00:58:20.024]  I just, uh, some side note entertainment news, uh, Cameron Diaz might be dating, uh, David Rothschild.
[00:58:20.605 --> 00:58:22.486]  So I thought you'd be excited to find that out.
[00:58:23.526 --> 00:58:24.547]  What about Lord Rothschild?
[00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:25.127]  What's going on?
[00:58:25.647 --> 00:58:27.888]  Oh, I was just, you know, it's not even really a big deal at all.
[00:58:27.908 --> 00:58:35.152]  I was just saying, I was reading something where she's, uh, someone posted on the prison platform that she, she's, uh... Oh yeah, that was in People Magazine.
[00:58:35.212 --> 00:58:37.713]  Cameron Diaz with Lord Rothschild, and we had on.
[00:58:38.093 --> 00:58:39.334]  Thank you so much for calling.

[00:59:25.387 --> 00:59:27.908]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.

[00:59:44.631 --> 00:59:47.172]  Why don't you give it to your friends and family?
[00:59:47.572 --> 00:59:48.692]  Why don't you tell your neighbors?
[00:59:48.712 --> 00:59:53.793]  Why don't you tell message boards and tech boards and people at work, hey, you ought to go subscribe to this podcast.
[00:59:54.614 --> 00:59:59.156]  You can set your player to throw it out of your player after a couple days, you know, if they build up.

[01:00:30.044 --> 01:00:31.605]  Now, I got a big, huge stack of news here.
[01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:32.446]  I'm going to be getting to it.
[01:00:33.507 --> 01:00:38.170]  But right now, I wanted to go back to your phone calls.
[01:00:38.891 --> 01:00:43.053]  Let's talk to Trina in Colorado.
[01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:43.614]  You're on the air.
[01:00:44.275 --> 01:00:45.236]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:46.377]  Good, thanks for calling.
[01:00:46.837 --> 01:00:50.320]  I have something I wanted to tell you guys about.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:57.585]  I don't know if you've already spoken about this on the air or at your station, but there's a new video that was just released.
[01:00:57.665 --> 01:00:59.006]  It's called Death of a President.
[01:00:59.086 --> 01:00:59.787]  Have you heard of that?
[01:01:01.528 --> 01:01:02.509]  Refresh my memory.
[01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.871]  It's a video that just came out.
[01:01:05.011 --> 01:01:10.795]  It's like a documentary style... That's the Canadian mockumentary where Bush gets killed?
[01:01:11.036 --> 01:01:11.296]  Yeah.
[01:01:12.239 --> 01:01:19.783]  Yeah, no, I saw the controversy a year ago when they shot it in Toronto, and no, I haven't seen it.
[01:01:20.183 --> 01:01:28.087]  Well, the reason that I find it so interesting is because George Bush is actually in it, and so is Dick Cheney.
[01:01:28.167 --> 01:01:28.727]  They're in it.
[01:01:29.427 --> 01:01:40.773]  And in my opinion, for the New World Order or these people to pull off what they're going to pull off to declare martial law and disarm us,
[01:01:41.657 --> 01:01:52.942]  I think a little bit of a twist could be for him, so they don't have to give up their office, is to fake the president being assassinated.
[01:01:53.803 --> 01:01:54.683]  It's just an opinion.
[01:01:54.903 --> 01:02:02.627]  The public is so dumbed down that they're getting to the point where they might even use that video from that movie and say it was real.
[01:02:02.707 --> 01:02:03.648]  And I'm not being sarcastic.
[01:02:03.688 --> 01:02:04.768]  British television
[01:02:07.755 --> 01:02:14.798]  got a clip that the CIA produced of fake confessions of Muslims, where they computer morphed it.
[01:02:14.858 --> 01:02:17.500]  They would show it to them at Camp X-Ray, torturing them.
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:27.844]  Then they released it on a TV program, admitting that it was fake, but then in another TV show said it was real, and said it was Muhammad Ata confessing.
[01:02:27.884 --> 01:02:36.028]  So, they take videos, they admit are fake and computer-generated, they play them on television and say they're real later, even when they admit they're not real.
[01:02:36.548 --> 01:02:38.730]  Now folks, that's how dumb they think you are.
[01:02:41.413 --> 01:02:42.654]  So you've got a good point there.
[01:02:42.674 --> 01:02:43.234]  Anything else?
[01:02:43.555 --> 01:02:48.139]  No, I just wanted to tell people they might want to watch that.
[01:02:48.239 --> 01:02:52.343]  And in the video, the guy that hypothetically kills George Bush
[01:02:52.947 --> 01:02:53.667]  Is a terrorist!
[01:02:53.767 --> 01:02:55.848]  And now we have to go to Syria and have a war.
[01:02:55.908 --> 01:02:59.810]  I mean, it's like, I was a terrorist, so now we're gonna go start a war with a dangerous country.
[01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:01.731]  Well, see, Captain America was killed by terrorists.
[01:03:01.771 --> 01:03:03.372]  He wouldn't submit to world government.
[01:03:03.752 --> 01:03:08.054]  He wouldn't submit to having an ID put in him and being controlled and tracked.
[01:03:08.434 --> 01:03:12.135]  And so, he was going to court, and then the very terrorist shoots him.
[01:03:12.175 --> 01:03:12.456]  See?
[01:03:12.896 --> 01:03:14.517]  Homeland Security knew best.
[01:03:14.557 --> 01:03:15.137]  I'm sorry.
[01:03:15.157 --> 01:03:16.397]  Yep, yep.
[01:03:16.437 --> 01:03:20.079]  And the other thing I wanted to say, I don't know if you guys have ever talked about it, I'm sure you have.
[01:03:20.509 --> 01:03:25.572]  But DIA has a lot of things going on down there.
[01:03:25.632 --> 01:03:31.735]  A gentleman that I crossed paths with about three months ago, he's like a conspiracy theorist.
[01:03:31.935 --> 01:03:33.475]  Yeah, Denver International Airport.
[01:03:33.676 --> 01:03:38.098]  Yeah, and they're digging dirt out of there at night from one until five in the morning.
[01:03:38.258 --> 01:03:45.061]  Every night they're pulling dirt out of there and all the neighbors all in that community don't know why and they're wondering what all that dirt is.
[01:03:45.081 --> 01:03:46.362]  They probably had a pipe bust.
[01:03:46.382 --> 01:03:48.503]  They've got a giant underground base there, that's admitted.
[01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:52.451]  It's the alternate capital under nuclear attack.
[01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:59.975]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:00.315 --> 01:04:02.256]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.616 --> 01:04:10.259]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.959 --> 01:04:18.003]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.403 --> 01:04:29.829]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.149 --> 01:04:33.631]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.112 --> 01:04:36.053]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:40.215]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:54.297]  Terrorism!
[01:04:54.477 --> 01:04:55.217]  Terrorism!
[01:04:55.317 --> 01:05:01.401]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:05:01.641 --> 01:05:03.243]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:05.964]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:06.345 --> 01:05:20.914]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:20.954 --> 01:05:21.255]  government.
[01:05:21.455 --> 01:05:23.256]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:23.616 --> 01:05:29.538]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:29.658 --> 01:05:34.180]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[01:05:53.075 --> 01:05:57.118]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:05:57.338 --> 01:06:00.740]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:04.423]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:06:04.643 --> 01:06:07.905]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:06:07.925 --> 01:06:13.389]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[01:06:13.429 --> 01:06:18.593]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[01:06:19.293 --> 01:06:19.674]  Thank you!

[01:07:04.712 --> 01:07:05.613]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.633 --> 01:07:10.233]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.454 --> 01:07:14.594]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.055 --> 01:07:20.336]  Well, it's one of the first big organic magazines, newspapers in the country.
[01:07:21.156 --> 01:07:23.596]  Started in 1970 right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:07:24.336 --> 01:07:27.137]  And every issue is about the pesticides, the
[01:07:28.201 --> 01:07:32.363]  Hormones, the GMO, what's going on, Acres USA, that's coming up in the next hour.
[01:07:32.844 --> 01:07:39.067]  Open phones in this hour, a ton of news coming up on all the stage terror, hysteria that we're witnessing, and a lot of other key issues.
[01:07:39.948 --> 01:07:46.031]  But we do have open phones on this Monday, as promised, at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:46.071 --> 01:07:48.673]  First-time callers are going to the head of the line today.
[01:07:50.234 --> 01:07:53.415]  Right now, let's talk to Rob in California.
[01:07:53.455 --> 01:07:54.436]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:07:55.973 --> 01:07:56.974]  What did you say, Rob?
[01:07:57.454 --> 01:07:57.874]  Yes, I did.
[01:07:57.914 --> 01:07:58.374]  You're on air.
[01:07:58.435 --> 01:07:59.095]  Yeah, okay.
[01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:01.696]  Yeah, actually, hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:08:01.797 --> 01:08:02.757]  Good!
[01:08:02.877 --> 01:08:09.841]  Yeah, I've been reading, I was looking at this site called threeworldwars.com and they talk about Albert Pike.
[01:08:09.921 --> 01:08:17.246]  There's some alleged correspondence between him and Giuseppe Mazzini.
[01:08:18.973 --> 01:08:27.293]  Yes, and I've interviewed researchers who have been to the Royal Naval Museum archives in London.
[01:08:28.201 --> 01:08:33.966]  And indeed there is the letter there from him about the three world wars and all the rest of it.
[01:08:33.986 --> 01:08:37.028]  He put a lot of that also in his Morals and Dogma.
[01:08:37.508 --> 01:08:38.069]  Oh, okay.
[01:08:38.109 --> 01:08:45.014]  But yeah, you're talking about the Illuminati leader out of Italy and of course there was correspondence.
[01:08:45.475 --> 01:08:46.295]  Right, yeah.
[01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:49.418]  The correspondence, I just didn't know if the three were that specific.
[01:08:50.313 --> 01:09:18.196]  letter about the three world wars might be uh... uh... the other one is in the royal naval museum it is there ok ok yeah because i i guess i i i read there was some question about that uh... yeah i guess that that i don't think i don't have a correction to make about something i was wrong about that go ahead uh... well on on their site it says uh... uh... it says that the keeper of the manuscripts recently informed the author that the letter is not cataloged at the british museum library
[01:09:18.803 --> 01:09:22.645]  So, I'm wondering why the... No, I'm not familiar with the controversy.
[01:09:22.665 --> 01:09:26.467]  I don't particularly know that website, so I really can't speak to it.
[01:09:26.527 --> 01:09:34.191]  Yeah, I'm not too sure, but anyway, the other thing I was wondering about is that belt buckle that Schwarzenegger was wearing on the cover of Time Magazine.
[01:09:35.912 --> 01:09:41.875]  I know that some people were saying that that was a motorcycle belt buckle, but to me it did look like a Nazi belt buckle.
[01:09:41.975 --> 01:09:48.458]  Okay, listen, I've been going to, and I appreciate your call, I've been going to gun shows since I was about five years old.
[01:09:50.677 --> 01:09:51.858]  I've never been a big collector.
[01:09:52.299 --> 01:09:53.501]  I don't get deep into something.
[01:09:53.541 --> 01:09:55.884]  I'll go, oh, I'll collect five or six World War II medals.
[01:09:56.105 --> 01:09:56.906]  Oh, that looks interesting.
[01:09:57.487 --> 01:09:59.590]  I kind of got little piles of junk here and there.
[01:10:02.944 --> 01:10:04.285]  Or I'll collect a few meteorites.
[01:10:04.305 --> 01:10:05.485]  You know, I'll collect a few.
[01:10:06.185 --> 01:10:11.628]  And I remember being in high school and then in college going to gun shows in Dallas and then in Austin.
[01:10:12.088 --> 01:10:13.849]  And I would go look at the World War II memorabilia.
[01:10:13.869 --> 01:10:15.609]  And I bought a British RAF medal.
[01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:17.950]  I bought an American tanker medal.
[01:10:19.431 --> 01:10:25.893]  I bought a 1933... I thought that year was interesting... Nazi party pin.
[01:10:25.933 --> 01:10:26.774]  I've got that somewhere.
[01:10:28.935 --> 01:10:29.075]  And
[01:10:30.592 --> 01:10:34.876]  I remember looking at Nazi belt buckles, and I remember thinking, that looks distinctively Western.
[01:10:35.317 --> 01:10:37.659]  It has like diamonds at the top and diamonds on the edge.
[01:10:38.019 --> 01:10:41.142]  Now, are there biker groups that have copied Nazi belt buckles?
[01:10:41.563 --> 01:10:43.745]  Well, yeah, they drive around a lot of them wearing Nazi helmets.
[01:10:44.245 --> 01:10:46.508]  The Iron Cross, I mean, they're into that.
[01:10:47.168 --> 01:10:51.753]  So, see, somebody who's into motorcycles will go, no, no, that's our design.
[01:10:51.953 --> 01:10:53.875]  No, that comes from the Nazis.
[01:10:55.265 --> 01:11:10.651]  And so for Schwarzenegger, it's a big joke, but the specific death's head belt buckle he's wearing is a Nazi belt buckle, officer's buckle, of a World War I type design that was reissued in World War II.
[01:11:10.671 --> 01:11:13.813]  In World War I, they wore giant skull helmets, okay?
[01:11:13.833 --> 01:11:15.933]  I mean, you talk about being fearsome.
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:32.363]  The Field Marshals and others wore huge helmets with not just the point on the top, sometimes double horns on, devil hats, with big huge skulls, skulls and crossbones on them.
[01:11:32.423 --> 01:11:35.684]  They're into it, and they were into killing.
[01:11:36.424 --> 01:11:44.026]  And so I don't know how else to explain that to people, and they would have big skulls on their biplanes and things like that.
[01:11:45.132 --> 01:12:02.469]  And so when I tell you that Schwarzenegger, listen, Schwarzenegger reportedly back in the 70s liked to dress up in an SS uniform at parties he'd have friends over and at costume parties Arnold would come out in a perfectly groomed, perfectly tailored SS uniform.
[01:12:02.509 --> 01:12:03.230]  That's been reported.
[01:12:04.056 --> 01:12:18.706]  And at the gym he would run around screaming, Holl Hitler, and calling the blacks in rages, you know, big huge black guys in the gym, challenging them to fights, screaming, I'll tear you apart, uh, niggers, uh, you know, excuse using that term, but let's just use what he said.
[01:12:18.726 --> 01:12:27.032]  Uh, he would hand out to friends, this has been confirmed in triplicate records of, uh, you know, recordings of Hitler speeches.
[01:12:27.052 --> 01:12:31.355]  Uh, he would, uh, I mean, just on and on, folks.
[01:12:32.616 --> 01:12:33.176]  And, uh,
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.842]  I don't know how else to go over history with people, how else to explain this to people.
[01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:45.125]  In Pumping Iron, he did say, I've always dreamed of really powerful people like Jesus, like Hitler.
[01:12:45.425 --> 01:12:46.625]  They had that footage.
[01:12:46.685 --> 01:12:48.766]  The directors have admitted they have it.
[01:12:48.866 --> 01:12:52.888]  Arnold bought the negatives so they wouldn't be released.
[01:12:52.928 --> 01:12:54.249]  He now owns Pumping Iron.
[01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:57.230]  I made a film about it.
[01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.910]  I made a film.
[01:12:58.611 --> 01:13:01.072]  It's the Marshall Law 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:06.722]  A third's about the police state, a third's about 9-11, and a third is about the New World Order death cult.
[01:13:08.903 --> 01:13:17.688]  And we've got photos in there of the World War I, the big giant skull outfits, and the horned outfits.
[01:13:17.968 --> 01:13:19.449]  I don't know about the horned outfits in there.
[01:13:20.369 --> 01:13:25.292]  And so Schwarzenegger, it's not like you've got Bloomberg wearing a skull.
[01:13:26.084 --> 01:13:27.325]  Number one, that's juvenile.
[01:13:27.345 --> 01:13:29.807]  Number one, a governor should... Let's say it's a biker belt buckle.
[01:13:30.087 --> 01:13:31.388]  He's in a suit, he's wearing a... No, no.
[01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:32.669]  It's in your face.
[01:13:33.009 --> 01:13:34.370]  It's a Nazi belt buckle.
[01:13:36.151 --> 01:13:46.858]  And of course you're going to have people that watch the Discovery Channel shows about choppers and are all into motorcycles, who don't know about World War II and haven't read 30, 40 books on it, and haven't constantly studied it until 3 a.m.
[01:13:47.239 --> 01:13:52.042]  hundreds of nights, and they're going to sit there and go, no, that's a biker belt buckle.
[01:13:52.482 --> 01:13:54.664]  Of course they're going to do that, because they don't know anything.
[01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:57.273]  That's why they're slaves.
[01:13:57.553 --> 01:14:02.037]  Now, let me go back.
[01:14:02.357 --> 01:14:03.518]  I'm rarely wrong about things.
[01:14:03.558 --> 01:14:07.401]  I mean, I'll get dates wrong, or I'll get little things wrong, because I really do my homework.
[01:14:07.661 --> 01:14:09.143]  But when I'm wrong about something, I'll say it.
[01:14:09.903 --> 01:14:12.005]  I'm not pleased to have to report this to you.
[01:14:12.966 --> 01:14:14.627]  I wrestled with this last night.
[01:14:18.991 --> 01:14:20.472]  I mean, I wrestle with things a lot.
[01:14:20.492 --> 01:14:21.533]  I try to be moral, folks.
[01:14:21.573 --> 01:14:23.414]  It doesn't mean I'm perfect, but I attempt.
[01:14:23.474 --> 01:14:24.235]  You understand the difference?
[01:14:24.335 --> 01:14:25.036]  I attempt to
[01:14:25.845 --> 01:14:26.746]  Be a better person.
[01:14:27.526 --> 01:14:30.568]  Let's say this, I'm not consciously deceptive, okay?
[01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:34.111]  And I'm wrong.
[01:14:35.172 --> 01:14:37.353]  Ron Paul is against net neutrality.
[01:14:42.156 --> 01:14:43.137]  And I thought, you know what?
[01:14:43.257 --> 01:14:45.379]  He's better than any candidate overall.
[01:14:46.279 --> 01:14:51.203]  Don't even go on air and talk about it because it'll just hurt the campaign.
[01:14:51.243 --> 01:14:54.265]  But at the same time, I can't, when I'm wrong about something,
[01:14:55.183 --> 01:15:00.045]  Listeners are going to hear that show two weeks ago and I tell the caller, the listener, no, no, no, he's not against net neutrality.
[01:15:00.065 --> 01:15:05.126]  They're going to hear that and think I'm, people think I know everything, which I don't by the way, and they're going to think I'm lying.
[01:15:05.706 --> 01:15:06.507]  No, I'm wrong.
[01:15:07.167 --> 01:15:13.249]  Ron Paul is against net neutrality and he's dead wrong on the subject.
[01:15:14.089 --> 01:15:18.030]  I never found anything Ron Paul was for that I was against.
[01:15:18.671 --> 01:15:19.891]  I never found him being wrong.
[01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:32.780]  But then I wanted to preface this, and it's such a complex issue that I want to be very careful how I describe this.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.562]  Maybe an article should be written.
[01:15:35.182 --> 01:15:36.704]  Maybe we should write an article about it.
[01:15:38.986 --> 01:15:42.870]  Something like, Ron Paul is wrong on net neutrality.
[01:15:45.191 --> 01:15:46.552]  And then nicely set him straight.
[01:15:47.072 --> 01:15:52.777]  You know, say he's the best candidate and he's wonderful and this is where pure libertarianism though gets off the track.
[01:15:54.118 --> 01:15:58.061]  I mean it's really, or I could say I disagree with Ron Paul about net neutrality.
[01:15:58.981 --> 01:16:00.983]  We'll be even more careful about it than that.
[01:16:01.383 --> 01:16:12.412]  But the point is, I am wrong when I got up here and a caller called in and said, I'll be honest with you, it was like a ten minute clip, we didn't listen to it all, John saw it and said,
[01:16:14.564 --> 01:16:16.785]  I didn't get from the clip that he was against net neutrality.
[01:16:17.165 --> 01:16:18.825]  Well, I actually went and finally watched the clip.
[01:16:19.465 --> 01:16:21.606]  I actually saw the stuff this weekend.
[01:16:21.626 --> 01:16:22.666]  I actually found his quotes.
[01:16:22.686 --> 01:16:25.226]  I actually went and watched some of the speeches he's given.
[01:16:25.266 --> 01:16:26.326]  So let me be specific.
[01:16:29.267 --> 01:16:32.108]  Ron Paul is pretty much a pure libertarian.
[01:16:34.008 --> 01:16:43.890]  And so he says you shouldn't be able to tell companies AOL, Time Warner, or Cogent, or Level 3, or any of these big backbone
[01:16:44.713 --> 01:16:47.495]  ...providers, AT&T, BellSouth, whatever.
[01:16:53.139 --> 01:16:55.121]  The Deutsch Telecom, whatever its new name is.
[01:16:55.141 --> 01:17:03.107]  You shouldn't be able to tell them that they have to let somebody else's internet traffic go over their systems.
[01:17:05.109 --> 01:17:22.537]  And that's what net neutrality is, is that AT&T and Viacom and the rest of them have said that we, and Time Warner, we want to force you to subscribe to lists of websites that pay us to let their traffic go over our backbones.
[01:17:25.399 --> 01:17:29.601]  Now, there are over 50 hubs in this country and main backbone providers.
[01:17:30.001 --> 01:17:34.823]  When one goes down, a third, 10%, sometimes more of the web is down.
[01:17:35.811 --> 01:17:36.971]  I mean it's devastating.
[01:17:38.432 --> 01:17:40.792]  And this will basically cripple the Internet.
[01:17:42.052 --> 01:17:46.533]  Now Ron Paul's argument is well the free market will come in and it'll get fixed in time.
[01:17:50.494 --> 01:17:53.835]  And frankly I just think Ron Paul and he's a very smart guy.
[01:17:54.115 --> 01:17:56.635]  I was wrong, he's not 74, he's 72.
[01:17:56.775 --> 01:18:01.736]  72 years old, he's on the Internet, he knows the Internet, but I mean I respectfully think Ron Paul doesn't fully understand this.
[01:18:03.217 --> 01:18:04.797]  And doesn't understand that
[01:18:06.153 --> 01:18:09.695]  Well, I mean, he said that we should gradually get people off welfare.
[01:18:09.715 --> 01:18:11.415]  You can't take them off overnight.
[01:18:11.435 --> 01:18:12.356]  I agree with him on that.
[01:18:13.636 --> 01:18:18.038]  He's against open borders because, you know, the pure libertarians want them totally open.
[01:18:18.338 --> 01:18:28.562]  Well, you can't take an unfree state to the South with a hundred million people that'll work for three times lower wages and bring them in while we still have a socialist system with the high taxes we've got to pay.
[01:18:28.602 --> 01:18:29.643]  It'll bankrupt everybody.
[01:18:31.063 --> 01:18:31.443]  You see?
[01:18:32.084 --> 01:18:35.585]  You can only have free trade if another country's truly free, next to you.
[01:18:36.332 --> 01:18:37.753]  Anyways, this is a very complex issue.
[01:18:37.773 --> 01:18:43.214]  Since I've gotten into it, I'll go over it and try to break this down as best I can.
[01:18:43.274 --> 01:18:47.416]  But yeah, Ron Paul is against net neutrality.
[01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:49.716]  And it is not good.
[01:18:50.497 --> 01:18:51.077]  We'll be right back.

[01:20:05.503 --> 01:20:07.584]  That's $688.50, $339.70, and $169.85.

[01:20:20.286 --> 01:20:22.447]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[01:20:22.607 --> 01:20:24.007]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:26.168]  Call 800-686-2237 for Corsi's report today.
[01:20:26.188 --> 01:20:26.428]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.826 --> 01:20:56.247]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.848 --> 01:21:00.470]  Did you know that our founding fathers gave us a Republican form of government?
[01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:05.052]  Why is all you ever hear from our leaders is that we're a democracy?

[01:21:24.026 --> 01:21:26.447]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:27.167 --> 01:21:31.489]  Have you ever been told the truth about why Russian Communism seemingly has fallen?
[01:21:32.289 --> 01:21:35.170]  Why did our government let Mikhail Gorbachev come here?

[01:21:41.273 --> 01:21:41.473]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:53.749 --> 01:22:01.216]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry, and I'm a plastic surgeon, and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[01:22:01.437 --> 01:22:03.899]  And I want to tell you today about a product that I developed.
[01:22:03.939 --> 01:22:08.904]  It's called Night Skin, and it helps your skin look younger without needles, without acid peels,
[01:22:09.945 --> 01:22:13.468]  In 12 hours, it will make your skin seem smoother.
[01:22:13.648 --> 01:22:16.110]  In 12 hours, it will stimulate collagen production.
[01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:19.733]  And in 12 hours, it will promote elastin growth in your skin.
[01:22:19.913 --> 01:22:20.694]  What does this all mean?
[01:22:20.954 --> 01:22:25.318]  Well, this is the stuff that makes your skin firm and healthy, and helps you look younger.
[01:22:25.598 --> 01:22:34.726]  Night Skin is real, and the results are real, and it contains only proven ingredients that work to lighten age spots, smooth the skin, and help diminish the appearance of wrinkles.
[01:22:35.026 --> 01:22:37.668]  It's easy, and in 12 hours, you'll see it works.

[01:22:43.633 --> 01:22:44.033]  That's 1-800-894-3462.
[01:22:44.053 --> 01:22:45.875]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[01:23:02.564 --> 01:23:13.592]  I mean, really, it's a libertarian interpretation.
[01:23:13.612 --> 01:23:19.037]  Ron Paul is against abortion because he rightfully knows that it's a human being in the womb.
[01:23:20.037 --> 01:23:21.338]  And it's not a choice.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:28.324]  And he's right on immigration because he understands that it will bankrupt the country, and while we still have a socialist system here,
[01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:30.592]  That we can't afford it.
[01:23:31.193 --> 01:23:33.214]  And then he knows the globalists are behind it.
[01:23:33.955 --> 01:23:39.259]  Now, the New World Order and Bush and the rest of them want to end net neutrality, just like they want to end the borders.
[01:23:41.021 --> 01:23:43.943]  Now, that right there should tell you it's not a good idea.
[01:23:44.583 --> 01:23:46.505]  The Internet was designed by DARPA.
[01:23:46.605 --> 01:23:48.126]  It was set up by the government.
[01:23:48.166 --> 01:23:50.308]  A lot of pure research comes out of the government.
[01:23:51.489 --> 01:23:57.914]  And the big tech companies literally stayed in business after the tech boom bust.
[01:23:58.653 --> 01:24:00.395]  Because of internet connection bills.
[01:24:00.555 --> 01:24:03.877]  It has funded the growth of technology.
[01:24:03.937 --> 01:24:04.878]  It's funded the sector.
[01:24:06.639 --> 01:24:12.464]  Basically, your subscribers are paying for the connections.
[01:24:12.804 --> 01:24:14.846]  And paying exorbitantly, by the way, for them.
[01:24:15.286 --> 01:24:16.728]  There's huge markup involved.
[01:24:16.788 --> 01:24:18.509]  And that is funding it.
[01:24:19.873 --> 01:24:21.394]  And they go into negotiations.
[01:24:21.434 --> 01:24:22.615]  Don't think there's not free market.
[01:24:22.655 --> 01:24:33.881]  Don't think that Cogent or Level 3 or AT&T versus some other cable system don't have debates and arguments about you're sending more traffic over us than we're sending back to you.
[01:24:34.421 --> 01:24:41.085]  And then the companies do restrict and cut back their bandwidth and things do go down for a while until they negotiate.
[01:24:41.425 --> 01:24:42.786]  That really is the free market.
[01:24:43.026 --> 01:24:45.187]  Because then if they're down too long, they lose customers.
[01:24:46.007 --> 01:24:47.028]  It is a free market.
[01:24:50.006 --> 01:24:59.212]  And so I would just tell Ron Paul, and next time I get him on I will bring this up or I'll call his office and tell him, because I'm blindsided by the fact that I don't think he understands this.
[01:25:00.753 --> 01:25:02.774]  And for Ron Paul, I mean, I can see what he's saying.
[01:25:02.814 --> 01:25:05.335]  Well, we can't tell companies who they have to do business with.
[01:25:05.375 --> 01:25:09.518]  We can't tell companies that they just have to let everybody's traffic go over their servers.
[01:25:10.794 --> 01:25:16.476]  And I really think Dr. Paul, I'm not going to tell him how to deliver a baby, but I think just, you know, he's 72 years old.
[01:25:16.596 --> 01:25:18.217]  I just don't think he understands this.
[01:25:18.757 --> 01:25:20.158]  I've interviewed the IT experts.
[01:25:20.198 --> 01:25:21.498]  I've read hundreds of papers on it.
[01:25:21.858 --> 01:25:22.959]  We know how it works.
[01:25:23.859 --> 01:25:28.821]  It's not just a bunch of tubes that you dump things on, in the words of the committee chairman.
[01:25:29.581 --> 01:25:34.163]  The big telecom spent 150 plus mil last year trying to end net neutrality.
[01:25:36.184 --> 01:25:38.345]  And folks, if they do that, it's internet too.
[01:25:38.385 --> 01:25:39.365]  The net is gone.
[01:25:40.037 --> 01:25:43.659]  Now, Ron Paul has said, well, if they start doing that, other things will form.
[01:25:43.739 --> 01:25:44.720]  Other systems will form.
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.341]  It will force the formation of new networks.
[01:25:48.022 --> 01:25:49.462]  And that may indeed happen.
[01:25:49.903 --> 01:25:50.383]  And who knows?
[01:25:50.463 --> 01:25:51.484]  Ron Paul may be right.
[01:25:52.844 --> 01:25:53.665]  But I know this.
[01:25:53.825 --> 01:25:56.787]  It is going to devastate things for at least several years.
[01:25:57.047 --> 01:25:59.308]  It is going to be devastating.
[01:26:00.994 --> 01:26:05.776]  And it's going to force you to go get domains on subdomains with AT&T.
[01:26:06.296 --> 01:26:08.837]  They're going to have 50 corporations and 50 universities.
[01:26:09.418 --> 01:26:10.378]  This has already been announced.
[01:26:10.438 --> 01:26:12.659]  I've been telling you about it for 5 years since I learned of it.
[01:26:13.579 --> 01:26:16.561]  And they're going to make you go have a subdomain like a MySpace account.
[01:26:17.121 --> 01:26:20.082]  I mean, you won't be able to get to InfoWars or Prison Planet anymore.
[01:26:21.503 --> 01:26:23.924]  And then they're going to make you pay higher prices.
[01:26:23.944 --> 01:26:26.225]  The states are now lobbying in Washington to do this.
[01:26:26.883 --> 01:26:29.224]  To make you pay taxes on emails.
[01:26:29.264 --> 01:26:30.585]  That's all part of the same package.
[01:26:30.865 --> 01:26:34.166]  The same crew that wants to end net neutrality wants email taxes.
[01:26:34.526 --> 01:26:36.387]  Now Ron Paul is against that.
[01:26:36.767 --> 01:26:41.009]  He's against the taxes, but then he is against net neutrality.
[01:26:41.049 --> 01:26:42.470]  And I just don't think he understands it.
[01:26:43.890 --> 01:26:45.151]  He does understand welfare.
[01:26:45.211 --> 01:26:47.172]  He knows you just can't take somebody right off of it.
[01:26:47.632 --> 01:26:50.153]  He's against it, but he says we've got to phase it in.
[01:26:53.661 --> 01:26:56.002]  Now, would I be for some phased-in 10-year deal?
[01:26:56.363 --> 01:26:56.843]  Probably.
[01:26:57.323 --> 01:27:00.605]  But again, the globalists are going to write the plan, whatever it is.
[01:27:01.025 --> 01:27:02.566]  It's going to be a bad one.
[01:27:04.507 --> 01:27:06.568]  And I've seen the big industry analysis.
[01:27:08.609 --> 01:27:17.574]  Peer-to-peer systems they're trying to force us onto, you know, where it's direct-to-direct, are going to kill the Internet.
[01:27:17.594 --> 01:27:18.495]  I mean, it will be dead.
[01:27:20.059 --> 01:27:22.880]  99% of the websites you can get to now, you will not be able to get to.
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:24.501]  Only mass agreements.
[01:27:24.521 --> 01:27:27.723]  And you'll still have thousands of choices, but it'll be like cable television.
[01:27:28.644 --> 01:27:34.768]  You'll think you've got thousands of choices, and it'll still feel like a choice, but it won't be the billions of choices.
[01:27:35.889 --> 01:27:45.435]  And the newspapers are dying, the television's in trouble, they're all circling the wagons with the state governments and the federal government right now to shut the web down.
[01:27:47.555 --> 01:27:50.458]  And Ron Paul was ecstatically received at Google.
[01:27:50.478 --> 01:27:52.339]  I actually read the transcript of his speech.
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:54.301]  And there it was, in black and white.
[01:27:54.741 --> 01:27:58.364]  And Google didn't like it, and the Google employees didn't like it, but they still like him.
[01:27:58.744 --> 01:28:00.286]  Because of his overall libertarian ideas.
[01:28:00.346 --> 01:28:04.889]  And there were quotes from him, and they're trying to argue with him and explain to him how this works.
[01:28:06.130 --> 01:28:07.331]  And Ron Paul's his own man.
[01:28:07.391 --> 01:28:07.992]  I respect him.
[01:28:09.293 --> 01:28:12.396]  But at the same time, we have to question our leaders.
[01:28:13.156 --> 01:28:15.278]  And we have to try to advise them and bring them up to speed.
[01:28:17.143 --> 01:28:31.513]  And, uh... Ron Paul, just like we can't take people off welfare immediately, just like we can't get rid of the borders completely in a pure libertarian sense, because of the laws of nature, we cannot get rid of net neutrality.
[01:28:32.533 --> 01:28:34.775]  And heaven help us when Ron Paul's for ending it.
[01:28:35.936 --> 01:28:37.056]  It means he doesn't understand it.
[01:28:37.417 --> 01:28:37.977]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:46.890]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.791 --> 01:28:50.595]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.621 --> 01:29:01.450]  You want to lose weight, but there's no way you want to resort to pills or shakes that are full of chemicals or drugs with harmful side effects.
[01:29:01.932 --> 01:29:03.193]  We know diets don't work.
[01:29:03.493 --> 01:29:05.354]  That's why there's the Fat Loss Patch.
[01:29:05.534 --> 01:29:12.558]  The Fat Loss Patch is a self-adhesive dietary aid worn daily that slowly releases all natural ingredients into the skin.
[01:29:12.758 --> 01:29:23.404]  The result is a safe and easy way for you to increase your energy levels, maintain a healthy body weight, and curb those horrible sugar cravings, all without irritating side effects or loss of muscle.
[01:29:23.604 --> 01:29:26.526]  Just peel it off, stick it on, and live your life!
[01:29:27.006 --> 01:29:29.827]  The Patch is safe, effective, and clinically tested.
[01:29:29.967 --> 01:29:34.808]  Also, the Fat Loss Patch is the most unique product and business opportunity to ever hit the U.S.
[01:29:34.968 --> 01:29:36.129]  and international markets.
[01:29:36.589 --> 01:29:37.509]  Join as a U.S.
[01:29:37.609 --> 01:29:41.951]  or European customer or distributor in this much-needed and fast-growing business.
[01:29:42.271 --> 01:29:46.332]  For more information, visit PatchMeeting.com or call Judy at 800-766-2133.
[01:29:46.412 --> 01:29:46.632]  That's 800-766-2133.
[01:29:54.002 --> 01:29:58.563]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:29:58.964 --> 01:30:01.905]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:30:02.225 --> 01:30:04.785]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:30:05.146 --> 01:30:09.967]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:30:10.347 --> 01:30:15.709]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:30:16.009 --> 01:30:18.970]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:20.711]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[01:30:21.831 --> 01:30:26.533]  Many people believe that this will be the mark of the beast because of the restrictive measures included.
[01:30:26.733 --> 01:30:30.874]  Which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[01:30:31.174 --> 01:30:37.436]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the mark of the beast, it says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[01:30:37.796 --> 01:30:39.417]  It says, worship the beast.
[01:30:39.697 --> 01:30:42.298]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[01:30:42.578 --> 01:30:48.047]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:30:48.187 --> 01:30:48.488]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:30:54.867 --> 01:30:58.708]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[01:30:58.988 --> 01:31:02.849]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[01:31:03.209 --> 01:31:08.230]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:19.692]  Electrolyzed Plus Water will alkalize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[01:31:20.032 --> 01:31:24.374]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and environmentally safe for humans and animals.
[01:31:24.635 --> 01:31:33.940]  Alkaline water is available as a concentrate to be mixed with good, filtered, purified, RO water but not tap water, micro-structured alkaline antioxidant water for consumption.
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:41.984]  Call for your Electrolyzed Plus Alkalinizing Miracle Rejuvenating Water Concentrate or other remarkable RPA Biotech products like Ultimate Fuel,
[01:31:42.344 --> 01:31:43.624]  Sports Performance Strength at 888-212-8871.
[01:31:43.644 --> 01:31:43.904]  That's 888-212-8871.
[01:31:43.924 --> 01:31:45.045]  Or go to NutraMedical.com.
[01:31:45.105 --> 01:31:47.085]  That's N-U-T-R-I with an I. Medical.com.
[01:32:12.469 --> 01:32:15.490]  I should have plugged this earlier, so you do to tune in to hear it.
[01:32:16.491 --> 01:32:18.572]  Coming up in just a few minutes, Ted Anderson's in the studio.
[01:32:18.592 --> 01:32:22.033]  It was his idea to go to Plainfield, and he's glad he did it.
[01:32:22.073 --> 01:32:26.955]  It drew attention to Brown's plight and what's happening with the income tax.
[01:32:30.106 --> 01:32:32.047]  And Ted is in studio up in Minnesota.
[01:32:32.067 --> 01:32:33.168]  He's the owner of the network.
[01:32:33.188 --> 01:32:34.729]  He'll be giving us a report.
[01:32:34.769 --> 01:32:36.871]  He saw with his own eyeballs the helicopter.
[01:32:38.071 --> 01:32:42.354]  I saw the video online of it flying around and over the party.
[01:32:42.775 --> 01:32:46.797]  Ted says there were closer to 300 people there on and off, coming and going.
[01:32:46.817 --> 01:32:48.378]  So that was certainly a big success.
[01:32:49.679 --> 01:32:55.463]  Again, the Browns surrounded in the past, convicted of fraudulent tax evasion.
[01:32:56.383 --> 01:33:00.606]  And he can give you a report of that coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:01.666 --> 01:33:10.672]  Before I do that, I wanted to tell the listeners about InnerFood.
[01:33:11.912 --> 01:33:15.875]  Bad nutrition is a breeding ground for illness due to stress and anxiety, not to mention
[01:33:16.542 --> 01:33:19.843]  The Loving Kemsrells ask yourself, what is your diet like?
[01:33:19.903 --> 01:33:25.385]  Processed foods and even good organics don't have the nutritional values that you need in today's world.
[01:33:25.425 --> 01:33:25.945]  Think about it.
[01:33:26.285 --> 01:33:31.707]  Have you forgotten that you were supposed to feel good and energetic all day long and if not, you aren't getting the nutrition you need?
[01:33:32.067 --> 01:33:36.629]  Stop wishing you had more energy and focus and make it happen today with one simple phone call.

[01:33:51.498 --> 01:33:51.839]  We love it.
[01:33:51.859 --> 01:33:54.520]  They've got a whole product line, by the way, at www.innerfood.com.

[01:34:45.794 --> 01:34:47.035]  We've got our Police State Trilogy for $34.95.

[01:35:25.722 --> 01:35:26.763]  It is an arsenal.
[01:35:26.923 --> 01:35:32.687]  It is an armory in the Infowar to download and burn TV shows, my book, Paul Watson's book,
[01:35:33.459 --> 01:35:36.141]  All my other films, a bunch of other films, just so much stuff.

[01:35:41.724 --> 01:35:42.004]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:35:42.024 --> 01:35:47.007]  I'm gonna get to... I'm gonna get to Kathy and George and Roger and John and Chris before this hour ends.
[01:35:47.027 --> 01:35:48.908]  But I just wanted to bring Ted Anderson up for 5-10 minutes.
[01:35:49.309 --> 01:35:49.509]  Uh, Ted, um,
[01:36:03.709 --> 01:36:18.317]  First off, Ted, because I never really talked to you about this, I just heard a few weeks ago that you had this idea, and a bunch of people went up there, Jack Blood and Dave Unkleist, and I believe We Are Change went up there, because I noticed that was on their website in a live feed link.
[01:36:19.258 --> 01:36:28.183]  A bunch of people went up there, and I'm told you said it was 200-300 people, very successful, and sure enough, I hope the Feds wouldn't engage in provocations.
[01:36:29.119 --> 01:36:32.120]  Well, we'll get into that, but why did you decide to go up there?
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:33.821]  Why did you think up this idea?
[01:36:34.741 --> 01:36:49.566]  Well, you know, I mean, you know, Dave obviously had a concert earlier, and that inspired my mind, and then I just said, you know, we should just do a concert, get some people up there, make, you know, get some names out there, make it happen so people actually, you know, take a look at this Ed and Elaine Brown thing.
[01:36:50.446 --> 01:36:56.788]  You know, we have to bring light to the subject, is basically what motivated me to do it.
[01:36:56.808 --> 01:36:58.409]  I mean, I would hate to see
[01:36:59.398 --> 01:37:05.603]  Another Ruby Ridge or Waco, Texas happened in New Hampshire.
[01:37:05.663 --> 01:37:13.368]  I mean that would be just, it would be just incredibly sad to see that kind of an ending to this beginning here.
[01:37:14.409 --> 01:37:19.733]  You know obviously there's been plenty of arguments on my network about whether or not there's a law that you have to file a 1040.
[01:37:23.181 --> 01:37:25.723]  There have been people that have been vindicated of this.
[01:37:25.803 --> 01:37:26.924]  They've taken it to court.
[01:37:26.984 --> 01:37:30.287]  They've been let off the hook by the jury in this particular case.
[01:37:30.327 --> 01:37:33.030]  A crier just got found, I need to get him on, not guilty last week.
[01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:38.781]  A lawyer down in Louisiana, he went into the jury and showed them how it was all a fraud.
[01:37:39.221 --> 01:37:45.763]  Yeah, and for some reason, some juries swing the way of not guilty, and other juries swing the way of guilty.
[01:37:45.783 --> 01:37:55.105]  Let me just be clear, it's like Aaron Russo says, if the mafia comes to you, to your grocery store and says, I'm going to kill you and your family if you don't pay me, most people pay him.
[01:37:55.145 --> 01:37:57.166]  And I'm not telling you to pay him or to not pay him.
[01:37:59.141 --> 01:38:11.611]  I don't even have time to really balance my books properly or even do proper financial planning because I'm so busy fighting New World Order that I haven't chosen that battle.
[01:38:12.092 --> 01:38:22.761]  Because I haven't chosen to personally fight them, I'm able to bring you Joe Bannister and the Browns and all these tax experts every few weeks and to cover and educate people.
[01:38:23.241 --> 01:38:24.942]  But, again, I don't have a dog in that fight.
[01:38:24.982 --> 01:38:28.945]  Ted, I know that you pay the income tax and pay it very carefully.
[01:38:29.726 --> 01:38:40.914]  Now, again, Money Magazine, what was it, and so did Forbes, but I remember back in 2000, had 50 different preparers do their taxes, and they got 50 different answers.
[01:38:41.294 --> 01:38:43.296]  It's written so that you can't follow the law.
[01:38:43.576 --> 01:38:44.937]  You do waive your Fifth Amendment.
[01:38:45.197 --> 01:38:46.478]  You do incriminate yourself.
[01:38:46.598 --> 01:38:48.580]  It is written to ensnare you.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:51.882]  It's written so they can come after you, even when you pay.
[01:38:52.222 --> 01:39:20.001]  You're frankly as likely to have them come after you, but I use the Quicken books and have an accountant and I, you know, it has the don't do this, this is moderate, this is safe, I do the safe, I overpay them, because number one, I don't make that much money so it isn't that much, but B, because that's not my fight, and if they ever audit me or come after me, it's going to be clear that even paying their tribute wasn't enough for Caesar, paying the mafia wasn't enough, they came back wanting more.
[01:39:20.401 --> 01:39:21.762]  Now, I've said that point
[01:39:23.163 --> 01:39:23.964]  You went up there.
[01:39:24.144 --> 01:39:24.685]  What did you see?
[01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:25.165]  What happened?
[01:39:25.746 --> 01:39:31.692]  Well, I mean, like you see on the website at GCNlive.com right now, there was a helicopter.
[01:39:31.772 --> 01:39:32.914]  It was Homeland Security.
[01:39:32.954 --> 01:39:39.441]  They were buzzing and buzzing low enough for you to feel the back blow of the wind coming down from the turbines up there.
[01:39:40.291 --> 01:39:51.016]  Uh, there was no question about it that they were trying to antagonize, uh, you know, uh, like you said, you know, for somebody to go out there and shoot a gun or shoot fireworks at them, it was a completely peaceful movement, thank goodness.
[01:39:51.716 --> 01:40:01.540]  Uh, not a person, uh, you know, other than a couple of birds that were flipped up to the, to the, uh, to the, uh, helicopter that was... Well, Ted, describe it, because, again, I sat down at 7.30 to eat dinner at the office,
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:02.640]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:40:19.731 --> 01:40:24.192]  I mean, it's right there with sirens going at about 60, 70 feet.
[01:40:24.212 --> 01:40:25.392]  Then it goes down even lower.
[01:40:25.653 --> 01:40:26.993]  Then it was flying over you guys.
[01:40:27.013 --> 01:40:29.333]  Then it turned its lights off and was flying around.
[01:40:29.553 --> 01:40:31.294]  Ted, describe what you saw with your eyeballs.
[01:40:31.454 --> 01:40:32.494]  Well, that was it, Alex.
[01:40:32.514 --> 01:40:35.055]  I mean, basically, we had the concert going.
[01:40:35.095 --> 01:40:36.175]  There was good food.
[01:40:36.235 --> 01:40:37.676]  People were having fun.
[01:40:37.716 --> 01:40:39.436]  There was some speakers that were giving... Dusk.
[01:40:39.456 --> 01:40:39.556]  Dusk.
[01:40:39.856 --> 01:40:43.518]  And right towards dusk, the helicopter was right there.
[01:40:43.778 --> 01:40:45.319]  They were shining their spotlights on.
[01:40:45.819 --> 01:40:46.719]  It was intimidation.
[01:40:46.739 --> 01:40:47.780]  There was no question about it.
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:50.141]  They wanted to make the people feel uncomfortable.
[01:40:50.181 --> 01:40:54.463]  I would imagine that their hope was that people would get scared and run away.
[01:40:55.063 --> 01:40:56.503]  I don't know exactly what their point was.
[01:40:56.543 --> 01:40:59.265]  I guess they were trying to say, hey we're here, we're watching.
[01:41:00.425 --> 01:41:03.647]  I'd love to have their video footage because they had a bird's eye view of what was going on.
[01:41:03.667 --> 01:41:04.387]  I hope they post it.
[01:41:05.387 --> 01:41:08.169]  You know, the thing is, it's a real issue.
[01:41:08.590 --> 01:41:10.771]  You spelt it out plain and clear, Alex.
[01:41:10.851 --> 01:41:13.133]  It is a very dangerous place to be right now.
[01:41:13.413 --> 01:41:14.594]  There is no question about it.
[01:41:15.514 --> 01:41:18.556]  The sheriff of the town said the same thing in the paper.
[01:41:18.937 --> 01:41:20.858]  It's a very dangerous place to be.
[01:41:21.058 --> 01:41:26.402]  They're afraid to send in their own 911 rescue team if somebody had a heart attack in there.
[01:41:26.442 --> 01:41:27.923]  You know, something simple as that.
[01:41:28.824 --> 01:41:36.091]  But the thing about it is that Ed and Elaine Brown are just two down to earth people.
[01:41:36.291 --> 01:41:39.514]  Elaine is a dentist and Ed is an exterminator.
[01:41:39.674 --> 01:41:45.360]  It's a dangerous place because they've had armored vehicles and drones and helicopters and fixed wing aircraft.
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:46.841]  We're good to go.
[01:42:02.931 --> 01:42:10.878]  Amnesty, that was in the bill, and four hundred plus thousand felons were released in one year in Houston alone out of their jails that were illegal aliens.
[01:42:11.198 --> 01:42:13.420]  I don't want to hear they can't just leave these people alone.
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:17.743]  They want a confrontation and I thought the feds would try to be smarter.
[01:42:17.763 --> 01:42:24.889]  It shows they're a bunch of buffoons, a bunch of evil people, that they would go in there with a helicopter trying to incite something.
[01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:30.194]  And thank God the feds didn't shoot a flare or something, you know, out of the woods themselves with their own helicopter.
[01:42:30.274 --> 01:42:30.474]  I was
[01:42:31.269 --> 01:42:44.747]  I mean, the pucker factor was pretty high as I was watching this, and I just can't believe... We're going to have a report out on JonesReport.com in the next few hours on this, just with the basic facts and the analysis of what we believe they're trying to do, so watch for that, everybody.
[01:42:46.970 --> 01:42:51.274]  Well, about 8, 39, once it got dark there, they turned their lights off.
[01:42:51.534 --> 01:42:52.876]  That's out of control.
[01:42:52.936 --> 01:43:01.503]  Flying around, literally a treetop level, over 300, 250, whatever it was, people, with a helicopter, right above the trees is very dangerous.
[01:43:02.004 --> 01:43:02.764]  What is the point?
[01:43:03.005 --> 01:43:04.466]  What was it like having a helicopter?
[01:43:04.486 --> 01:43:05.387]  It was a gray helicopter.
[01:43:05.587 --> 01:43:07.329]  Now, from the video, it looks like a gray helicopter.
[01:43:07.349 --> 01:43:08.289]  What color was it?
[01:43:08.450 --> 01:43:09.911]  And actually, in the daylight, it was white.
[01:43:10.751 --> 01:43:12.112]  There's a white helicopter.
[01:43:12.432 --> 01:43:13.613]  On the video it looked light gray.
[01:43:13.813 --> 01:43:23.720]  Yeah, I suppose getting towards dusk with the sun going down and who knows how well the camera is able to pick up the light, but in my vision it's white.
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:24.660]  I mean what is gray?
[01:43:25.081 --> 01:43:26.482]  It's a slight variation of white.
[01:43:28.443 --> 01:43:32.845]  We looked it up, I've seen Homeland Security helicopters that are a light gray, so it looked like what we've seen already.
[01:43:32.865 --> 01:43:34.625]  Well, it very well could have been light gray.
[01:43:34.645 --> 01:43:37.307]  It looked like the FBI hostage rescue team helicopter.
[01:43:37.507 --> 01:43:48.432]  In the bright sun, you know, it could make a gray helicopter look very light, I'm sure, reflecting, but light gray or white, I can just tell you right now, it was... Well, you were there, I believe you, it was a white helicopter.
[01:43:48.452 --> 01:43:50.313]  Yeah, a white helicopter is what I remember.
[01:43:50.353 --> 01:43:55.515]  I can go back and look at my pictures, I think... My gosh, imagine, we're sitting there eating, going, oh, I'm glad things went well, and all of a sudden...
[01:43:55.975 --> 01:43:57.296]  Here comes the helicopter.
[01:43:57.316 --> 01:43:58.736]  I was like, oh man.
[01:43:59.416 --> 01:44:00.937]  It was all about intimidation, Alex.
[01:44:01.057 --> 01:44:02.697]  Actually, the police up there were real nice.
[01:44:02.977 --> 01:44:05.078]  They counted the people coming in.
[01:44:05.098 --> 01:44:06.238]  There was an ordinance factor.
[01:44:06.258 --> 01:44:11.280]  If there was more than 200 in there at any one time, I think there was going to be an issue.
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:15.741]  We had to pull a permit, I guess, to do it.
[01:44:16.441 --> 01:44:18.622]  I don't think we ever exceeded that number, which is good.
[01:44:19.302 --> 01:44:21.945]  Let's be clear, you said 200 to 300.
[01:44:22.185 --> 01:44:23.146]  How many?
[01:44:23.466 --> 01:44:26.329]  I believe, I mean I didn't count them coming through, but I just looked at the crowd.
[01:44:26.369 --> 01:44:37.379]  I think roughly it could have been 200, but I've seen people coming and going and the grounds stay pretty well full, so I'm sure that the number may have exceeded 200 and it may have been less than 300.
[01:44:37.419 --> 01:44:38.921]  I don't know, it could have been less than 200.
[01:44:38.961 --> 01:44:39.741]  Alright, whatever, 200 plus.
[01:44:40.582 --> 01:44:43.084]  Yeah, and a huge success.
[01:44:43.185 --> 01:44:51.312]  Obviously, the people that were watching online, you know, that numbered into the 1,600 to 2,000 people, and then plus people were taking the stream and re-putting it out.
[01:44:51.352 --> 01:44:55.635]  So, you know, the real numbers of how many people seen it, it's definitely past 2,000.
[01:44:55.695 --> 01:44:57.197]  Well, the point is, the point is,
[01:44:58.738 --> 01:45:01.240]  It's a demonstration of the new technologies that are being developed.
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:05.703]  It brought attention to what's happening, and I think overall it'll be a positive thing.
[01:45:05.723 --> 01:45:09.226]  And we'll get a big report out on JonesReport.com in the next few hours.
[01:45:09.906 --> 01:45:14.350]  But Ted, thank you for going up there to support the Browns, and God bless you, my friend.
[01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:18.133]  Well, Alex, I've seen you do it many times, and I just thought, you know, it's my turn.
[01:45:18.333 --> 01:45:20.935]  And I'm going to get out there, too, and I appreciate what you're doing.
[01:45:20.955 --> 01:45:23.396]  Ted, you're getting pretty adventurous, pretty wild.
[01:45:23.577 --> 01:45:25.678]  Well, you know... Ted Anderson, adventurer!
[01:45:26.138 --> 01:45:26.919]  Dun-dun-dun!
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:30.442]  Well, you know, I've got to keep the network on air.
[01:45:30.502 --> 01:45:31.483]  That's the main thing.
[01:45:31.503 --> 01:45:32.944]  You're talking about the taxes.
[01:45:32.964 --> 01:45:33.684]  Do I file 1040?
[01:45:33.985 --> 01:45:34.525]  Yes, I do.
[01:45:34.925 --> 01:45:38.168]  If I don't file the 1040 and they come in and shut me down, what happens to Genesis?
[01:45:38.508 --> 01:45:40.610]  The greater good is to file the taxes here.
[01:45:40.730 --> 01:45:41.651]  There's no question about it.
[01:45:41.891 --> 01:45:43.212]  Plus, also, it's a corporation.
[01:45:43.232 --> 01:45:46.114]  From what I understand, corporations are required to file taxes.
[01:45:46.194 --> 01:45:50.377]  Exactly, but we're not arguing and saying people are bad that do not.
[01:45:50.558 --> 01:45:53.400]  We're saying you're good, you're heroes, we support your fight.
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:57.303]  We're saying, I can't fight five, six, ten front wars.
[01:45:57.764 --> 01:46:01.170]  We're fighting, I'm fighting the info war, trying to reach people.
[01:46:01.551 --> 01:46:03.975]  So folks, you know, I've had other people criticize other talk show hosts.
[01:46:04.336 --> 01:46:06.400]  Alex Jones admits he pays them!
[01:46:06.721 --> 01:46:07.903]  He funds them!
[01:46:08.444 --> 01:46:08.725]  Folks,
[01:46:09.526 --> 01:46:10.768]  They issue the money.
[01:46:10.808 --> 01:46:11.508]  They control it.
[01:46:11.529 --> 01:46:17.595]  The Federal Reserve admits it's about getting economies and countries in debt and pulling the debt out from under them.
[01:46:17.956 --> 01:46:19.518]  It's about getting real property.
[01:46:19.918 --> 01:46:21.700]  It's about getting you into a system.
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:24.043]  You don't hurt them not paying taxes.
[01:46:24.323 --> 01:46:26.405]  You don't hurt the government not being funded.
[01:46:26.646 --> 01:46:27.867]  They just issue more money.
[01:46:28.188 --> 01:46:30.030]  They do this to have control.
[01:46:30.710 --> 01:46:31.690]  That's why they do it.
[01:46:31.930 --> 01:46:33.351]  Yeah, control and they get your wealth.
[01:46:33.851 --> 01:46:34.791]  That's the bottom line.
[01:46:34.871 --> 01:46:42.714]  We're working for them and they want you to not pay, but pay improperly and not know your rights so they can win and get your house.
[01:46:43.034 --> 01:46:45.195]  For a $10,000 bill, they get a $300,000 house.
[01:46:45.235 --> 01:46:47.535]  Yeah, but it still befuddles me, Alex.
[01:46:47.555 --> 01:46:53.557]  How can you walk into a court of law here in the United States of America and say, hey, there's no law that I broke, and yet have a conviction?
[01:46:54.518 --> 01:46:55.478]  It kind of drives me nuts.
[01:46:56.218 --> 01:46:57.819]  That's what's good about the Brown situation.
[01:46:57.839 --> 01:47:05.081]  As long as it stays peaceful, that's what we want, because it continues to educate people about the fact that there is no law and that it is a fraud.
[01:47:05.341 --> 01:47:06.661]  Ted Anderson, thank you for coming in.
[01:47:06.761 --> 01:47:07.982]  Hey, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[01:47:08.202 --> 01:47:09.622]  How was the weather there in New Hampshire?
[01:47:09.662 --> 01:47:10.322]  Just beautiful.
[01:47:10.362 --> 01:47:11.563]  You couldn't ask for better weather.
[01:47:11.903 --> 01:47:12.843]  The sun was shining.
[01:47:13.123 --> 01:47:15.004]  It was probably in the seventies.
[01:47:16.204 --> 01:47:21.305]  And of course, Vermont and New Hampshire, I don't think there's a more beautiful place in this country than that particular spot.
[01:47:21.345 --> 01:47:22.666]  It was just absolutely
[01:47:23.446 --> 01:47:24.547]  We're glad everybody was safe.
[01:47:24.567 --> 01:47:25.148]  Nobody got hurt.
[01:47:25.168 --> 01:47:25.928]  Nothing bad happened.
[01:47:54.483 --> 01:47:58.605]  And by the way, that stuff was going on before it all kicked off, but I guess people didn't want to scare folks off.
[01:48:00.506 --> 01:48:02.567]  Variant, but why would the Feds do that?
[01:48:02.607 --> 01:48:03.268]  Intimidation?
[01:48:03.348 --> 01:48:04.989]  Trying to elicit some type of response?
[01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:06.850]  They wanted to go in there, folks.
[01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:08.411]  They want to kick off World War III.
[01:48:09.471 --> 01:48:11.172]  They want to start an arms insurrection.
[01:48:11.932 --> 01:48:18.276]  And unfortunately, I think that both sides, people in the Patriot movement are wanting that in some areas, and people on the other side are wanting that.
[01:48:18.996 --> 01:48:22.158]  He who gets violent first is going to end up losing this fight.
[01:48:23.653 --> 01:48:26.694]  And, again, we are winning the info war.
[01:48:27.654 --> 01:48:29.695]  That's why they're wanting to shut the web down right now.
[01:48:30.195 --> 01:48:33.256]  We cannot allow them to do it.
[01:48:35.357 --> 01:48:38.758]  When we come back, I promise, I'm going to get to Kathy, George, Roger, John, and Chris.
[01:48:38.778 --> 01:48:46.121]  We're going to get to all of you, and then about ten after, we're going to have a guest on from AcresUSA to get into what I wish I could do.
[01:48:46.801 --> 01:48:49.382]  I mean, believe me, folks, if I had the money and I had the time,
[01:48:50.666 --> 01:48:52.608]  Unfortunately, everybody's moved in here from California.
[01:48:52.628 --> 01:48:53.428]  I'm not knocking you.
[01:48:53.748 --> 01:48:59.913]  Central Texas is nice, but land that 15 years ago was $500 an acre is $10,000 an acre around here.
[01:49:00.434 --> 01:49:03.436]  But I would get out of Dodge and go live and go solar.
[01:49:04.597 --> 01:49:09.420]  I mean, I'd work at a feed store making $8 an hour.
[01:49:10.001 --> 01:49:11.502]  I'd mow yards out in the country.
[01:49:11.982 --> 01:49:15.145]  And I'd plant crops and I would do odd jobs.
[01:49:15.625 --> 01:49:16.506]  I'd pump gas.
[01:49:17.213 --> 01:49:25.618]  And I'd just watch my young'uns grow up out in the country and I'd sit down and you know do their homework with them and work eight hours a day.
[01:49:25.638 --> 01:49:34.022]  And that's why we're going to be talking about because for those of you that can, I would get out of the cities now as fast as you can.
[01:49:34.342 --> 01:49:35.663]  But study the town you're in too.
[01:49:35.683 --> 01:49:41.266]  A lot of these towns that CPS run, drug dealer sheriffs run them and SWAT teams rule over everyone.
[01:49:41.326 --> 01:49:43.287]  So a lot of the local, again,
[01:49:44.233 --> 01:49:48.317]  It's just, but if stuff really hits the fan, the country's gonna be the place to be.
[01:49:48.857 --> 01:49:49.478]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.901 --> 01:50:02.448]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.809 --> 01:50:10.435]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.129 --> 01:50:18.193]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.593 --> 01:50:30.019]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.339 --> 01:50:33.781]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.282 --> 01:50:36.243]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.563 --> 01:50:40.405]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.810 --> 01:51:03.878]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:04.118 --> 01:51:15.348]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:15.688 --> 01:51:21.413]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:51:21.553 --> 01:51:22.133]  I don't know.
[01:51:39.462 --> 01:51:40.003]  Let's get it!
[01:51:54.421 --> 01:51:56.643]  Oh, those summer nights and those summer electric bills.
[01:51:56.843 --> 01:52:00.167]  How would you like to save money this summer on your electric bill and sleep better than ever?
[01:52:00.387 --> 01:52:02.989]  Well, now you can with the BedFan personal cooling system.
[01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:06.713]  The BedFan will allow you to raise your thermostat several degrees and still sleep cool.
[01:52:06.953 --> 01:52:11.557]  This works by delivering a gentle breeze between your sheets, thus keeping your body cool and comfortable.
[01:52:11.858 --> 01:52:13.179]  Doug from Austin, Texas writes,
[01:52:13.559 --> 01:52:15.262]  I like it to be very cold while sleeping.
[01:52:15.362 --> 01:52:21.350]  Since purchasing the BedFan, I've been able to turn the thermostat up from 68 to 78 degrees, and I've never been more comfortable.
[01:52:21.530 --> 01:52:25.475]  My electric bill this month compared to the same month last year is over 27% lower.
[01:52:25.675 --> 01:52:27.117]  I couldn't be happier with your product.
[01:52:27.338 --> 01:52:30.662]  Maybe it is time you started thinking about trying the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:52:30.862 --> 01:52:32.223]  If you're a hot sleeper, you will love it.
[01:52:32.383 --> 01:52:34.544]  If you want to lower your electric bill, you will love it too.
[01:52:34.744 --> 01:52:37.725]  Go to BedFan.com and try the remarkable BedFan yourself.
[01:52:37.866 --> 01:52:39.947]  That's BedFan.com or call 210-632-8280.
[01:52:40.107 --> 01:52:40.347]  That's 210-632-8280.
[01:52:40.387 --> 01:52:42.588]  The BedFan is on sale for a limited time, so don't delay.
[01:52:42.608 --> 01:52:43.448]  Remember, BedFan.com or 210-632-8280.
[01:53:13.425 --> 01:53:30.213]  Let's go straight to your calls.
[01:53:31.834 --> 01:53:33.494]  Kathy in Virginia, thanks for holding.
[01:53:34.415 --> 01:53:34.915]  Hi Alex.
[01:53:35.335 --> 01:53:35.635]  Hello.
[01:53:36.115 --> 01:53:38.937]  I have a question for you and then a brief comment.
[01:53:39.867 --> 01:53:52.015]  Back in 1943 my father was a camp counselor in Chicago and a little boy left and went home and died and a couple days later they came back and told him this little boy died of polio.
[01:53:53.096 --> 01:54:02.002]  My father came down with polio and needless to say when the vaccines came along in the mid 1950s guess who was first in line to get her vaccines?
[01:54:02.122 --> 01:54:02.342]  Me!
[01:54:03.423 --> 01:54:09.607]  I know all about the simian virus 40 but one thing I haven't heard about is any is there any
[01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:17.532]  Well, there's been a lot of different cancer viruses that have accidentally, in quotes, always been associated with big UN inoculation global programs.
[01:54:30.564 --> 01:54:32.625]  out of the eugenicist laboratories.
[01:54:32.645 --> 01:54:41.787]  They even come right out of laboratories founded by eugenicists, by the Carnegie, Rockefeller, and Harriman endowments in England, Germany, and the US.
[01:54:43.028 --> 01:54:47.489]  And then, of course, magically, cancer viruses end up in them.
[01:54:47.549 --> 01:55:00.033]  And what happens is, after your DNA is divided so many times, it begins to malfunction and becomes more susceptible to allowing massive replication due to the simian virus 40, which causes a string of different
[01:55:00.626 --> 01:55:01.507]  We're good to go.
[01:55:19.938 --> 01:55:22.819]  And of course we have massive increases in cancers.
[01:55:23.319 --> 01:55:30.842]  But it's many other cancer viruses and most viruses are virus, most cancers are virus related, virus induced.
[01:55:31.503 --> 01:55:35.404]  And you notice the media and the culture doesn't like to educate the public about that.
[01:55:35.764 --> 01:55:36.685]  That it's communicable.
[01:55:36.725 --> 01:55:39.146]  It's always just like, oh, you just get it.
[01:55:40.646 --> 01:55:47.109]  And I mean literally over 90% of viruses according to a lot of top scientists and the mainline science are virus related.
[01:55:47.953 --> 01:55:50.174]  It's just your body can't fight it off once you're older.
[01:55:51.694 --> 01:56:01.036]  Or a lot of times your body's had so many auto problems because your body's been so attacked by toxins, poisons, other viruses that finally your body just kind of gives up and says, okay, I just accept it.
[01:56:01.496 --> 01:56:09.478]  And then the other types of cancers you've got are autoimmune related, where the body is fighting all this stuff and just flips out and over, you know, cranks up its autoimmune system.
[01:56:10.039 --> 01:56:11.599]  Or the autoimmune system shuts off.
[01:56:12.443 --> 01:56:16.365]  There's a lot of different, but it's being induced by these.
[01:56:16.805 --> 01:56:19.227]  I mean, cancer 1900 was very rare.
[01:56:19.987 --> 01:56:22.368]  And it was even more rare if you go back to the 1750s.
[01:56:23.949 --> 01:56:26.670]  And they knew what it was.
[01:56:26.710 --> 01:56:27.531]  They did autopsies.
[01:56:27.951 --> 01:56:28.651]  They diagnosed.
[01:56:29.132 --> 01:56:32.193]  People tended to die of the flu or colds or malnutrition.
[01:56:34.695 --> 01:56:35.995]  They say that we live longer today.
[01:56:36.035 --> 01:56:36.796]  That's not true.
[01:56:37.316 --> 01:56:39.277]  Statistically it is, but not in actuality.
[01:56:40.015 --> 01:56:42.417]  About a third of people died within one year.
[01:56:43.458 --> 01:56:45.319]  And roughly half died by age 10.
[01:56:46.159 --> 01:56:50.242]  But if you made it past age 10, people all the time lived to 98, 100.
[01:56:50.943 --> 01:56:55.046]  People actually lived much longer, 500 years ago, 200 years ago.
[01:56:55.966 --> 01:56:58.428]  Now on average, most of the babies don't die.
[01:56:59.209 --> 01:57:01.810]  But we die at a younger age.
[01:57:02.111 --> 01:57:04.833]  Like Russia right now has an average age of 55.
[01:57:05.413 --> 01:57:06.494]  That's dropping like a rock.
[01:57:07.374 --> 01:57:09.416]  And it's because of what they put into us.
[01:57:10.166 --> 01:57:12.789]  And it's designed to kick in once you're, quote, not productive.
[01:57:13.230 --> 01:57:16.133]  That's the older eugenics model, back when they still needed workers.
[01:57:16.653 --> 01:57:22.380]  Now they're, the globalists are writing, they don't need us anymore because of robotics and the automation of the system.
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:27.946]  And so they're just going to move into, you know, you'll wonder why people have got cancer like it's the cold now.
[01:57:28.226 --> 01:57:30.369]  They're just dying up and down my street, I know that.

[01:57:51.455 --> 01:57:52.496]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.216 --> 01:57:54.337]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.998 --> 01:57:55.798]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.559 --> 01:57:57.460]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:01.823]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.303 --> 01:58:06.387]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:17.362]  Continuing with your phone calls in a certain final hour.
[01:58:18.323 --> 01:58:20.184]  John in California, first time caller.
[01:58:20.204 --> 01:58:21.205]  Then we'll go to George and others.
[01:58:21.705 --> 01:58:23.166]  John, you're on the air.
[01:58:23.186 --> 01:58:23.787]  Oh, hey Alex.
[01:58:24.287 --> 01:58:24.887]  Nice to meet you.
[01:58:25.668 --> 01:58:26.589]  Nice to talk to you.
[01:58:27.469 --> 01:58:28.070]  Oh, good, good.
[01:58:28.170 --> 01:58:38.857]  Hey, I was just calling about the helicopter over there in New Hampshire, and I just wanted to let anyone who might be interested know that, according to the Federal Aviation Regulations, Section 91-119, minimum safe altitudes,
[01:58:42.034 --> 01:58:50.696]  That other over other than congested areas and altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over open water or sparsely populated areas.
[01:58:50.736 --> 01:58:57.418]  In those cases, the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle or structure.
[01:58:58.158 --> 01:59:09.641]  So basically, well, I haven't seen many video or pictures, but it seems to me that if someone would call the FAA, a certain pilot might lose his license.
[01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:14.631]  Or at least have it suspended, and I know... I mean, not when it's the FBI and Homeland Security.
[01:59:14.671 --> 01:59:18.312]  They can barbecue children at Waco and get commendations for it.
[01:59:18.332 --> 01:59:21.073]  I just thought I'd throw in my two cents worth.
[01:59:21.113 --> 01:59:24.174]  No, no, I mean, I'm aware there's all sorts of regulations and things.
[01:59:24.814 --> 01:59:27.375]  Give me that regulatory code number again.
[01:59:27.815 --> 01:59:28.655]  It's section 91.119.
[01:59:28.735 --> 01:59:29.296]  Section 91.119?
[01:59:29.336 --> 01:59:33.017]  Yeah, in the Federal Aviation Regulations.
[01:59:38.689 --> 01:59:46.155]  Yeah, this helicopter was at 25 feet in heavily wooded areas.
[01:59:46.576 --> 01:59:57.225]  It was coming down, it was going up to 75 to 100 feet, then it was dropping back down to 60 most of the time, and then it would go behind trees at what looked to be about 25 feet.
[01:59:58.546 --> 01:59:59.707]  And I mean right up in them.
[02:00:00.187 --> 02:00:00.948]  Very dangerous.
[02:00:01.949 --> 02:00:03.450]  Yeah, sounds pretty crazy to me.
[02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:04.591]  Over 200 people.
[02:00:07.290 --> 02:00:15.797]  Yeah, I mean, I can't say because I didn't see them, and I do agree with you, they can do whatever they want, but, I mean, it's still just ridiculous.
[02:00:16.258 --> 02:00:23.064]  Breaking, you know, these are federal regulations, so it's not like, you know, some little township said that you can't do this.
[02:00:23.144 --> 02:00:24.865]  I mean, the federal government says you can't do that.
[02:00:24.905 --> 02:00:27.968]  Yeah, but you can't steal $3.9 trillion from the Pentagon, but they've done it.
[02:00:28.388 --> 02:00:29.189]  I know, I know.
[02:00:29.569 --> 02:00:32.071]  I mean, that's my point, is they're just, they're totally lawless.
[02:00:32.572 --> 02:00:32.812]  Yeah.
[02:00:33.837 --> 02:00:50.807]  Well, I just want to add one other thing, you know, in your interview with Lord God Rothschild, it was really funny, I thought, the way he, you know, he kind of gets everyone to, like, want to get, you know, he wants to fearmonger by saying that, you know, well, don't you want these things for your children, and I want these things for my children?
[02:00:50.827 --> 02:01:00.753]  And what's really funny about it is, is he wanted everyone to kind of go along with it, and it was the classic collectivist argument of,
[02:01:01.363 --> 02:01:05.626]  Well, if we all just give up a little bit, it'll be the greater good for the greater number.
[02:01:05.646 --> 02:01:10.269]  And really, it's the elite with their sick One World Government plan.
[02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:19.216]  Yeah, but the way he tried to wrap it up and disguise it, it was so ham-handed.
[02:01:19.276 --> 02:01:21.157]  It was actually pretty funny, I thought.
[02:01:21.869 --> 02:01:38.142]  Well, and then, I mean, no doubt he knows the Order of the Planets, any five-year-old does, but he giggled and snickered when I pointed it out three more times because he is going, according to like a CNN audience, where... I mean, I actually got emails arguing with me about the Order of the Planets after that.
[02:01:38.562 --> 02:01:40.504]  I mean, they just believe whatever they're told, man.
[02:01:41.104 --> 02:01:42.425]  It's staggering.
[02:01:42.946 --> 02:01:43.566]  It's sad, Alex.
[02:01:43.606 --> 02:01:45.688]  Well, that's all I have.
[02:01:45.708 --> 02:01:48.430]  Hey, listen, thanks for the call, and have a great day.
[02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:49.171]  Thank you.
[02:01:50.077 --> 02:01:53.718]  Now, we've got the fellow from Acres USA coming on, founded in 1970.
[02:01:54.179 --> 02:01:55.799]  I'll probably have him on 20, 30, 40 minutes.
[02:01:55.839 --> 02:01:56.159]  I don't know.
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:57.100]  Great guy.
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:00.661]  And we'll jam in the callers that are holding.
[02:02:00.701 --> 02:02:06.904]  I will get to George and John and Chris and a few others that are on the board, but that'll be it for calls.
[02:02:08.404 --> 02:02:09.385]  Man, we did a pretty good job.
[02:02:09.425 --> 02:02:10.405]  Took a lot of calls today.
[02:02:11.065 --> 02:02:12.406]  Took about, what, 20 calls or so?
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:25.688]  I've got to sometime get into all the top headlines from today, but they're all up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.net and PrisonPlanet.tv right now for you.
[02:02:25.708 --> 02:02:31.453]  I mean, there's just a full press right now, a fear monger about terrorists about to hit us any minute.
[02:02:31.954 --> 02:02:36.598]  That's clearly in conjunction with the attack they want to carry out on Iran.
[02:02:36.618 --> 02:02:37.959]  It's just a question of will they do it?
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:39.741]  Are they crazy enough to turn east?
[02:02:40.742 --> 02:02:42.603]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[02:02:42.623 --> 02:02:43.024]  Stay with us.
[02:02:48.837 --> 02:02:52.001]  It's here, after a year in production traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.341 --> 02:02:54.303]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.664 --> 02:03:02.292]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:10.033]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.453 --> 02:03:21.898]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.178 --> 02:03:25.659]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.139 --> 02:03:28.100]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:32.242]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:48.669 --> 02:03:51.450]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.710 --> 02:03:55.872]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.292 --> 02:03:57.133]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.453 --> 02:04:02.015]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.495 --> 02:04:04.616]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:05.116 --> 02:04:19.802]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:19.842 --> 02:04:26.905]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:04:36.555 --> 02:04:37.556]  Each night when you sleep,
[02:04:48.740 --> 02:04:53.104]  Your body uses the time to restore itself so that you could wake up feeling renewed.
[02:04:53.624 --> 02:04:56.006]  But wouldn't it be nice to also wake up looking younger?
[02:04:56.487 --> 02:05:04.154]  Now there's Night Skin, a serum that goes on while you sleep to reduce age spots, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and moisturize the skin.
[02:05:04.754 --> 02:05:11.320]  Night Skin was made by Dr. Arthur Perry, a board-certified cosmetic surgeon, as an alternative to some invasive surgeries.
[02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:17.025]  It has real ingredients that have been shown to reduce the signs of aging and fight natural sun damage.
[02:05:17.665 --> 02:05:19.286]  All while you get a good night's sleep.
[02:05:19.727 --> 02:05:23.230]  Try Night Skin today and see what it's like to wake up feeling renewed.
[02:05:23.670 --> 02:05:24.971]  Both inside and out.

[02:05:38.198 --> 02:05:38.478]  Call 1-800-894-3418.
[02:05:38.498 --> 02:05:38.738]  That's 1-800-894-3418.
[02:05:46.994 --> 02:05:53.015]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.635 --> 02:05:56.676]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:10.118 --> 02:06:11.878]  Alright, welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:11.918 --> 02:06:15.599]  Now eight minutes into this third hour today.
[02:06:17.348 --> 02:06:26.332]  I, a few years ago, came across an AcresUSA magazine when I was sitting in a lube and tire place having my tires rotated.
[02:06:26.352 --> 02:06:27.993]  I thought, man, this is great.
[02:06:28.093 --> 02:06:32.995]  One article was about GMO foods and how to get around them and how to do organic farms.
[02:06:33.035 --> 02:06:42.920]  And another article that I saw later, somebody mailed me a copy, was about what was happening with the bees and other stories about just, I mean, it's constantly really good information.
[02:06:42.940 --> 02:06:45.821]  Then I found out, I was reading in the back of it, that it was
[02:06:46.661 --> 02:06:51.447]  Published right here in Texas, right here in Austin, where I live, and that it's been done since 1970.
[02:06:51.587 --> 02:06:56.072]  In fact, here's AcresUSA, the first issue of the magazine.
[02:06:56.532 --> 02:06:58.575]  Chicken cancer hits 90%.
[02:07:00.157 --> 02:07:01.638]  What is eco-agriculture?
[02:07:01.878 --> 02:07:03.400]  The AcresUSA philosophy.
[02:07:04.301 --> 02:07:04.862]  The founder.
[02:07:06.243 --> 02:07:07.485]  Just amazing stuff.
[02:07:08.468 --> 02:07:10.449]  I'll just tell you right now, they are not a sponsor.
[02:07:11.309 --> 02:07:13.049]  I never go after sponsors, you know that.
[02:07:13.670 --> 02:07:22.592]  This is somebody I want as a sponsor because it's Texas, it's Austin, it's a national magazine, it is a well-done magazine, and it is so jam-packed full of info.
[02:07:22.973 --> 02:07:24.033]  Plus, their website is great.
[02:07:24.053 --> 02:07:25.333]  It's just AcresUSA.com.
[02:07:28.524 --> 02:07:32.989]  Yes, USA.com or just go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:07:33.349 --> 02:07:34.310]  We have links over to them.
[02:07:34.330 --> 02:07:35.371]  I'm going to tell you how to subscribe.
[02:07:35.392 --> 02:07:36.192]  They're not a sponsor.
[02:07:36.713 --> 02:07:40.117]  I hope they'll become one because this is something I want to talk about every day.
[02:07:40.677 --> 02:07:49.867]  This is just the best magazine because even these so-called organics magazines, it's always got some kind of New World Order stuff mixed into it.
[02:07:50.227 --> 02:07:50.608]  They don't.
[02:07:51.323 --> 02:07:55.187]  I mean, it's just really good, thick publication.
[02:07:55.668 --> 02:07:56.329]  Well done.
[02:07:56.849 --> 02:07:59.793]  And again, I hope everybody will get a subscription to AcresUSA.
[02:07:59.833 --> 02:08:00.894]  AcresUSA.com.
[02:08:01.214 --> 02:08:03.497]  We'll give you their phone number and other information a little bit later.
[02:08:04.573 --> 02:08:07.654]  Chuck Walters is the founder and is our guest.
[02:08:07.934 --> 02:08:09.534]  Mr. Walters, thank you for coming on, sir.
[02:08:10.014 --> 02:08:11.054]  Oh, you're welcome.
[02:08:11.235 --> 02:08:11.955]  Glad to be here.
[02:08:12.435 --> 02:08:23.137]  Tell me, I mean, you were organic in country before it was cool, back when people didn't even know what organic meant, back in the 1960s, and then of course you founded this magazine in 1970.
[02:08:24.577 --> 02:08:26.178]  Tell us how you founded it and why you started it.
[02:08:26.798 --> 02:08:31.979]  Well, you know, I was connected with the National Farmers Organization.
[02:08:33.018 --> 02:08:42.660]  Back in the 60s, you probably, if you're not too young, will remember that we had farm strikes and milk holding actions and all kinds of things.
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:43.240]  Yes.
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:55.243]  Because agriculture was being underpaid and they were steadily, and have been ever since World War II, in the business of eliminating excess population out of agriculture.
[02:08:56.623 --> 02:08:58.944]  So I was writing a book called Unforgiven.
[02:08:59.867 --> 02:09:24.410]  And in writing the book, I started dealing with some of the data later on, and I found that what we were doing, we were using junk science to produce our food, and we were adding these expenses geometrically, but the production was only increasing arithmetically, kind of a Malthusian equation.
[02:09:26.764 --> 02:09:34.432]  And so I started digging into this quite a bit and it dawned on me what was wrong here.
[02:09:34.652 --> 02:09:36.114]  We were producing junk!
[02:09:36.997 --> 02:09:42.199]  And the farmer was getting junk prices for it, but he thinks he was producing quality.
[02:09:42.399 --> 02:09:50.422]  Now let's explain how this scam works, because I've read online articles by your great team of writers, I've read just three issues now of your magazine.
[02:09:50.462 --> 02:09:57.505]  It fits with my decades of research similarly, and of course you know much more than I do, but just for the audience, it checks out.
[02:09:58.695 --> 02:10:20.304]  They fool people that radical genetic engineering and pesticides and all this high-tech stuff saves them money and the farmers and ranchers don't notice that over 10-20 years it actually adds all these expenses and regulations and doesn't really even increase the output and does end up costing you a lot more money and actually centralizing and bankrupting the family farm, correct?
[02:10:20.784 --> 02:10:24.886]  I would say that was pretty largely a good summary and correct.
[02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:36.643]  So it's another fraud by Big Agra and the big chemical makers, and it really isn't helping people, but folks don't know they've been conned because they're stretched out over such a long period of time.
[02:10:36.783 --> 02:10:37.784]  Break that down for us.
[02:10:38.064 --> 02:10:40.184]  It goes a little deeper than that.
[02:10:41.685 --> 02:10:48.927]  You see, you've heard us ever since the Eisenhower administration, they remark a military-industrial complex.
[02:10:49.948 --> 02:10:53.949]  You have to add to that the military-industrial-university complex.
[02:10:55.154 --> 02:11:07.637]  The University joined arms with the Fertilizer Institute and the munitions makers and industry in order to make agriculture a dumping ground for its toxic wastes.
[02:11:08.537 --> 02:11:14.019]  Because coming out of the wars, they had all of these things that would qualify as pesticides.
[02:11:14.199 --> 02:11:15.419]  Same thing with the fluoride.
[02:11:15.439 --> 02:11:22.641]  They had tens of tons from aluminum in the aircraft and from fertilizers, so they said, oh, we'll make it a nutritious additive.
[02:11:23.041 --> 02:11:23.541]  Right!
[02:11:24.681 --> 02:11:27.222]  In other words, dilution was the solution.
[02:11:27.302 --> 02:11:34.806]  If we put it in everybody's water supply, we'd get rid of this stuff, which is a little more difficult to get rid of than atomic waste.
[02:11:35.026 --> 02:11:42.849]  And now we know that fluoride exactly precipitates out in the bones of the body, and it turns out they knew that from 1934 UT studies.
[02:11:43.389 --> 02:11:44.010]  Absolutely.
[02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:45.410]  Please continue, sir.
[02:11:46.351 --> 02:11:46.791]  I'm sorry?
[02:11:47.571 --> 02:11:48.912]  I said, please continue.
[02:11:48.932 --> 02:11:49.552]  This is riveting.
[02:11:52.552 --> 02:12:06.816]  Basically, coming out of Fort Detrick, Maryland, where we were creating the poisons, they decided that they could find a new form of agriculture.
[02:12:07.416 --> 02:12:12.798]  So, in 1949, they set up poison control centers all over the country.
[02:12:13.487 --> 02:12:26.337]  And these were centers so that when the farmer called in and explained that he'd gotten this stuff all over him or something and he felt this, that, and the other, the doctor would have somewhere to go to get an answer because he didn't know.
[02:12:26.357 --> 02:12:31.842]  So that was the start of this modern agriculture.
[02:12:32.594 --> 02:12:35.757]  Based on partial and imbalanced fertilization.
[02:12:35.957 --> 02:12:40.981]  Did you know the doctors told my grandfather that Cooper Tox killed him and that they saw all the farmers and ranchers?
[02:12:41.342 --> 02:12:46.606]  They'd tell you put this stuff on cow's backs to stop flies, but it was actually cyanide powder.
[02:12:47.026 --> 02:12:54.073]  And after he used that one summer, he was a bull of a man, really healthy, been a gunner in World War II.
[02:12:55.033 --> 02:13:04.915]  And he just was sick ever, you know, from the 60s on, and then he died, of course, with massive cancer all over his body, thanks to the Coupertox, another gift from the government.
[02:13:05.075 --> 02:13:20.758]  All of these things are a gift from the government, researched and validated by the university system, on behalf of the fossil fuel industry and their byproducts, and their satellite companies called Biologic and Pharmaceutical Houses.
[02:13:22.557 --> 02:13:24.218]  So there's the connection, you see.
[02:13:24.779 --> 02:13:46.353]  And what we were trying to answer with the first issues of AcresUSA was to push the envelope a little bit and cross the line and explain to people that what they were doing, they were being sold a what I would call junk science.
[02:13:48.434 --> 02:13:52.277]  Yes, it could produce more bins and bushels for the first few years.
[02:13:53.058 --> 02:13:55.159]  At the cost of destroying the soil.
[02:13:55.700 --> 02:14:01.303]  So now we have soil that has less than a half of a percent organic matter in it.
[02:14:01.343 --> 02:14:05.385]  Now you write issue after issue on that and explain, soil is alive!
[02:14:05.986 --> 02:14:07.146]  Yes, it's alive.
[02:14:07.206 --> 02:14:14.450]  If you're in a double handful of alive soil, you've got more units of life than you have people on the face of the planet.
[02:14:15.791 --> 02:14:22.295]  Now you start, if you take and put a drop of, let's say a gigantic drop of acid
[02:14:23.391 --> 02:14:24.091]  On Chicago.
[02:14:24.111 --> 02:14:27.712]  How many people have you wiped out?
[02:14:28.593 --> 02:14:35.195]  Well, that's what you do every time you put a drop on on these, the soil of any of these things.
[02:14:35.215 --> 02:14:36.255]  I don't care what it is.
[02:14:40.396 --> 02:14:41.536]  And that's what occurs us.
[02:14:41.676 --> 02:14:50.039]  I mean, we basically have funneled back to the beginning of the previous century and moved ahead to the present one.
[02:14:50.715 --> 02:15:02.961]  And well beyond where we are now in unveiling proper and appropriate technology that will produce more bins and bushels without the assistance of toxicity.
[02:15:04.642 --> 02:15:06.323]  That's basically what we're after.
[02:15:06.443 --> 02:15:13.787]  Well I have family and I know a lot of people personally in agriculture and they swear by the data in AcresUSA
[02:15:15.476 --> 02:15:21.199]  How do people subscribe to AcresUSA and give people an idea of what they'll learn with AcresUSA?
[02:15:21.579 --> 02:15:27.161]  Well, I think the best program for people, they can call in at 1-800-355-5313 and ask
[02:15:35.438 --> 02:15:42.859]  Why don't you call in and ask for a sample copy and tell them you're interested in subscribing and they'll send you the material if you're interested.
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:49.641]  If you're not interested after reading it, there's no point subscribing because you're not going to be happy unless you are happy to start with.
[02:15:49.661 --> 02:15:50.481]  1-800-355-5313.
[02:15:50.561 --> 02:15:51.001]  That's correct.
[02:15:51.021 --> 02:15:53.701]  What we've done over these last, uh, what?
[02:16:03.039 --> 02:16:03.579]  37 years.
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:06.481]  37 years, 38 years, yeah, something like that.
[02:16:07.461 --> 02:16:17.627]  What we've done is just created the greatest assembly of biologically correct information that's available anywhere in one package.
[02:16:20.448 --> 02:16:23.590]  Now folks can also get bundles of back issues if they want them, can't they?
[02:16:23.950 --> 02:16:25.751]  I don't know what the status of that is.
[02:16:25.811 --> 02:16:28.212]  They can get them, but you know how that is.
[02:16:28.252 --> 02:16:29.713]  You run out of them, you run out of them.
[02:16:30.413 --> 02:16:34.837]  Well, I mean, I've talked to the people in the organics movement, and I mean the real farmers that are really doing it.
[02:16:34.857 --> 02:16:36.178]  Oh yeah, they can get a hold of it.
[02:16:36.438 --> 02:16:39.601]  And they say that AcresUSA is the Bible.
[02:16:39.941 --> 02:16:42.543]  And again, I was just flattered to know you were hidden right under my nose.
[02:16:43.424 --> 02:16:48.208]  Well, my son, Fred Walters, is now running this.
[02:16:48.288 --> 02:16:52.852]  I'm 81, and so I've, what they call, titularly retired.
[02:16:53.652 --> 02:16:56.575]  I still write quite a few articles for the magazine.
[02:16:57.335 --> 02:16:59.155]  But he's doing the day-to-day business.
[02:16:59.536 --> 02:17:01.276]  We'll have to get him on as well.
[02:17:01.356 --> 02:17:04.297]  I'm just really impressed with your publication.
[02:17:04.317 --> 02:17:07.578]  And that's what I try to do, is bring my listeners the best material we found.
[02:17:07.618 --> 02:17:09.398]  And we need to get back to the land.
[02:17:09.418 --> 02:17:10.879]  We need to get away from all this stuff.
[02:17:10.919 --> 02:17:14.300]  Well, we need to do more than that.
[02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:23.222]  Wendell Berry, who's quite a well-known writer in this subject... Something going on here?
[02:17:24.002 --> 02:17:24.883]  We're going to break, sir.
[02:17:24.923 --> 02:17:25.783]  Just stay there.
[02:17:25.823 --> 02:17:27.624]  We'll come back and get into it.
[02:17:28.225 --> 02:17:36.830]  Absolutely, we're fighting the entire New World Order agenda, but this area of getting back to the land, getting true organic food, and educating the public about it, we believe is key.
[02:17:47.961 --> 02:17:52.465]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:52.805 --> 02:17:56.909]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:57.189 --> 02:17:57.750]  We listened.
[02:17:58.050 --> 02:18:03.034]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:03.315 --> 02:18:03.815]  We listened.
[02:18:04.195 --> 02:18:07.218]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:07.658 --> 02:18:08.179]  We listened.
[02:18:08.639 --> 02:18:12.700]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:13.561]  We listened.
[02:18:13.901 --> 02:18:19.142]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:18:19.562 --> 02:18:20.903]  Again, we listened.
[02:18:21.283 --> 02:18:22.863]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[02:18:23.043 --> 02:18:28.605]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:18:29.065 --> 02:18:31.727]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[02:18:31.907 --> 02:18:32.107]  Only $279.
[02:18:32.167 --> 02:18:32.748]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:32.788 --> 02:18:33.028]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:33.088 --> 02:18:34.709]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:18:34.729 --> 02:18:35.689]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:46.008 --> 02:18:49.853]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:18:49.893 --> 02:18:51.154]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:18:51.294 --> 02:18:54.878]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:18:55.179 --> 02:18:57.682]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[02:18:58.082 --> 02:18:59.844]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:19:00.164 --> 02:19:02.327]  They've both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:19:03.528 --> 02:19:09.092]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:19:09.132 --> 02:19:11.634]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:19:11.694 --> 02:19:13.555]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:23.741]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.

[02:19:27.541 --> 02:19:30.242]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[02:19:30.262 --> 02:19:30.922]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:19:45.618 --> 02:19:47.339]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:19:47.500 --> 02:19:48.741]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:19:48.981 --> 02:19:51.823]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:19:52.183 --> 02:19:54.945]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:19:55.486 --> 02:20:02.211]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:20:31.391 --> 02:20:31.611]  Call 877-873-9626.
[02:20:31.671 --> 02:20:32.052]  That's 877-873-9626.
[02:20:44.707 --> 02:20:47.428]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[02:20:47.868 --> 02:20:50.169]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[02:20:50.469 --> 02:20:53.551]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[02:20:54.031 --> 02:20:56.172]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[02:20:56.352 --> 02:20:57.733]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[02:20:57.993 --> 02:21:02.114]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[02:21:02.455 --> 02:21:05.556]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[02:21:05.856 --> 02:21:07.097]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[02:21:08.317 --> 02:21:16.605]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with Live52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[02:21:16.945 --> 02:21:19.648]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[02:21:20.028 --> 02:21:27.335]  Live52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol, and prescription medications.
[02:21:27.575 --> 02:21:30.297]  If you're a farmer or rancher, you've moved out to the country, you want to know how to
[02:21:56.503 --> 02:21:58.165]  Have a little garden just in your backyard?
[02:21:59.366 --> 02:22:03.691]  I've got a garden that's probably about 200 square feet.
[02:22:03.751 --> 02:22:04.352]  Not even that.
[02:22:05.173 --> 02:22:08.957]  And it grows more tomatoes and peppers and stuff than I can eat.
[02:22:08.977 --> 02:22:11.920]  And it grows quite a few eggplants and cabbages and onions.
[02:22:11.980 --> 02:22:12.601]  It's ridiculous!
[02:22:13.972 --> 02:22:23.475]  And believe me, I'd love to move to the country and just feed myself and can and do all that, but at least you can learn about what safe foods are, what real organics are, what healthy milk is.
[02:22:23.695 --> 02:22:25.776]  I mean, it covers the whole gamut.
[02:22:25.796 --> 02:22:35.079]  Describe for us, Chuck Walters, the man who founded it, his son runs it today here in Austin, back in 1970, just some of the things people will learn in AcresUSA.
[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:39.541]  Well, I think the first thing you learn is to ask a plant.
[02:22:40.529 --> 02:22:43.331]  You have to find out what makes the plant tick.
[02:22:43.871 --> 02:22:48.273]  And when you do, you find out it isn't toxins, it isn't salt fertilizers.
[02:22:49.454 --> 02:22:55.817]  It's putting that plant in touch with the source of all energy, which is energy from the sun.
[02:22:56.618 --> 02:23:04.982]  The sun kicks in about 22 subatomic particles, which are converted by photosynthesis
[02:23:06.633 --> 02:23:16.876]  And we produce about six and a half pounds of this kind of product, food product, per capita, per day, every year.
[02:23:18.837 --> 02:23:34.101]  And so Acres tries to orient people in the direction that, look, maybe it costs a little bit more for some of these ecologically friendly products, but subtract your mounting
[02:23:34.634 --> 02:23:39.238]  Medical expenses from that, and you find out it's the cheapest investment of all.
[02:23:39.918 --> 02:23:47.984]  We now have one out of three people in the United States can expect to have cancer at some time in their life.
[02:23:49.025 --> 02:23:51.667]  Now that's a disgrace to a civilized society.
[02:23:51.747 --> 02:23:58.492]  It's exploded, and I notice, because I have some back issues here, you were writing about this back in 1970 in your first issue.
[02:23:59.093 --> 02:23:59.453]  Oh yeah.
[02:24:00.265 --> 02:24:02.287]  I don't remember what's in the first issue.
[02:24:02.727 --> 02:24:05.470]  We also cover things like economics and so on.
[02:24:05.510 --> 02:24:11.936]  I do remember in one of the first issues, that was right about time that Nixon closed the gold window?
[02:24:11.956 --> 02:24:14.138]  Yes.
[02:24:14.158 --> 02:24:15.619]  Guess what my headline was?
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:16.760]  What?
[02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:18.802]  The Roman Road to Ruin.
[02:24:20.077 --> 02:24:21.538]  Boy, it is the Roman road to ruin.
[02:24:21.578 --> 02:24:25.082]  Did you know the dollar has been devalued by 57% against British Sterling?
[02:24:25.382 --> 02:24:32.348]  No, excuse me, 57% against the Euro, 59% against British Sterling just in the last seven years.
[02:24:32.728 --> 02:24:32.888]  Yep.
[02:24:33.949 --> 02:24:35.531]  Yep, we're destroying the money.
[02:24:36.431 --> 02:24:43.998]  We've got people putting their money into banks on certificates of deposit, which I refuse to call that.
[02:24:44.439 --> 02:24:47.101]  They really are certificates of confiscation.
[02:24:47.532 --> 02:24:50.674]  You're old enough to remember when they made everybody turn their gold in in 1933.
[02:24:50.774 --> 02:24:52.015]  Oh, yes.
[02:24:52.856 --> 02:24:53.416]  Yes, I am.
[02:24:53.516 --> 02:24:55.798]  You know, I tell yuppies that and they don't believe me.
[02:24:56.638 --> 02:24:57.679]  They think I'm making it up.
[02:24:58.479 --> 02:25:06.325]  Well, they don't believe a lot of things because they're not tuned in on history or have lived it and had memory.
[02:25:06.345 --> 02:25:11.188]  A lot of people have lived through this era between the 20s and the present.
[02:25:12.045 --> 02:25:19.651]  But they don't have a memory that goes along with it day by day, or century, decade by decade.
[02:25:20.251 --> 02:25:27.837]  And that's why it's necessary for them to do some reading, and to follow some editorial tracks that lay this out for them.
[02:25:28.337 --> 02:25:31.699]  Then they put it all together, and all of a sudden they see where they're going.
[02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:38.925]  Right now, we're in a posture, we got 737 military bases around the world.
[02:25:39.605 --> 02:25:40.406]  They talk about
[02:25:41.468 --> 02:25:43.188]  The troops coming home from Iraq.
[02:25:43.689 --> 02:25:45.449]  They're not going to come home from Iraq.
[02:25:45.469 --> 02:25:46.369]  They never come home.
[02:25:46.389 --> 02:25:51.871]  They're not going to come home from any place that the way we're running it, because all they'll do is rotate some.
[02:25:52.671 --> 02:25:54.091]  We're not going to get out of Iraq.
[02:25:54.131 --> 02:25:56.932]  We're not going to get out of Uzbekistan.
[02:25:56.952 --> 02:25:58.712]  Bush said we'd be out in six months.
[02:25:59.212 --> 02:26:00.333]  Bush said we'd be out in six months.
[02:26:00.353 --> 02:26:02.993]  The official Pentagon plan said 100 years.
[02:26:03.053 --> 02:26:03.634]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:26:04.074 --> 02:26:08.975]  That's about right, because we have adopted the idea of a Roman Empire.
[02:26:10.310 --> 02:26:12.053]  And we're doing this based on debt.
[02:26:12.593 --> 02:26:20.204]  There was a time when I was a youth that the economy ran and the flywheel and the balance wheel of the economy was agriculture.
[02:26:21.506 --> 02:26:25.432]  You had to have agriculture on par with wages and capital costs.
[02:26:26.446 --> 02:26:34.509]  But that gave security to the people and independence to the people and self-determination to the people, not to the central bank financiers.
[02:26:34.549 --> 02:26:37.729]  They had to get us off the land so the road to serfdom could be complete.
[02:26:38.030 --> 02:26:47.452]  And right now we've got these, you know, the big policy at the end of World War II was to get the land into a few strong hands.
[02:26:48.013 --> 02:26:55.555]  At the same time, MacArthur was the Shogun of Japan and he called the, there was about a hundred, I think,
[02:26:57.211 --> 02:26:59.773]  Probably a thousand and thirteen or something like that.
[02:26:59.793 --> 02:27:03.115]  Yeah, he made the families die fast and break the land up, yeah.
[02:27:03.836 --> 02:27:11.581]  He made those people deed their land to the government and then the government sold it to the people who were actually operating it.
[02:27:12.722 --> 02:27:13.702]  And they still have it.
[02:27:14.483 --> 02:27:17.065]  They haven't gotten it into a few strong hands.
[02:27:17.605 --> 02:27:24.410]  At the same time, we follow the policy of getting not thousands, but millions of people off the land.
[02:27:25.820 --> 02:27:26.181]  Stay there.
[02:27:26.241 --> 02:27:27.162]  Final segment with you.
[02:27:27.202 --> 02:27:28.564]  It's Acres USA.

[02:27:36.194 --> 02:27:37.115]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.596 --> 02:27:39.178]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.119 --> 02:27:42.782]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.588 --> 02:27:46.988]  Attention!
[02:27:47.109 --> 02:27:49.911]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[02:27:50.211 --> 02:27:54.514]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:27:54.834 --> 02:27:55.515]  Listen closely.
[02:27:56.175 --> 02:28:03.640]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[02:28:03.941 --> 02:28:12.687]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[02:28:13.007 --> 02:28:18.512]  Yeah, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[02:28:18.792 --> 02:28:28.280]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:30.862]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners.
[02:28:30.862 --> 02:28:32.543]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:28:32.563 --> 02:28:36.527]  Did you know that the mother of all secret societies, the Illuminati, worships Lucifer, better known as Satan the Devil?
[02:28:56.284 --> 02:29:03.029]  Did you know that they are the individuals giving rise to the final world social system described in Revelation Chapter 13?
[02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:09.253]  Did you know they were the founders of international communism to be the seen enemy of Christianity?
[02:29:09.774 --> 02:29:15.197]  To be used to destroy America so that we could be merged into an all-powerful one-world government?
[02:29:16.278 --> 02:29:24.384]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:29:46.405 --> 02:29:49.348]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:29:49.508 --> 02:29:54.753]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:29:55.033 --> 02:30:00.298]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:30:00.718 --> 02:30:01.859]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:02.240 --> 02:30:11.148]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:30:11.468 --> 02:30:11.528]  Yes!
[02:30:11.548 --> 02:30:13.150]  Now compare a cowbend pure soap.
[02:30:13.390 --> 02:30:17.554]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[02:30:39.949 --> 02:30:41.030]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[02:30:57.148 --> 02:31:09.537]  Bertrand Russell and other globalist think tank masters, we literally have hundreds of books, thousands of documents, wrote about how they were going to debase the food value, inject you with mercury-filled vaccines to brain damage you.
[02:31:10.058 --> 02:31:11.158]  They wrote this in the 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s.
[02:31:11.178 --> 02:31:19.244]  They talked about how they were going to take you off the land, put you in compact cities, then start the one-child policies and bring it all in.
[02:31:19.905 --> 02:31:21.206]  I'm making a film about it right now.
[02:31:21.826 --> 02:31:22.587]  This isn't a joke.
[02:31:23.496 --> 02:31:24.176]  It isn't a game.
[02:31:24.216 --> 02:31:25.377]  We've got to get self-sufficient.
[02:31:25.397 --> 02:31:26.838]  We've got to stop the Real ID Act.
[02:31:27.298 --> 02:31:29.019]  We've got to stop the Premises ID Act.
[02:31:29.459 --> 02:31:30.939]  We've got to stop the Animal ID Act.
[02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:32.520]  It's all meant to get control of us.
[02:31:33.040 --> 02:31:33.921]  And we've got to do it now.
[02:31:34.611 --> 02:31:36.252]  You can give AcresUSA a call.
[02:31:36.272 --> 02:31:37.652]  Again, they're not sponsors.
[02:31:37.932 --> 02:31:41.133]  I hope they will become sponsors, but you need this magazine.
[02:31:41.153 --> 02:31:41.814]  1-800-355-5313.
[02:31:41.834 --> 02:31:42.154]  1-800-355-5313.
[02:31:42.174 --> 02:31:51.757]  We're talking to the founder of AcresUSA, Chuck Walter.
[02:31:51.777 --> 02:31:53.018]  We'll go back to him in just a second.
[02:31:53.038 --> 02:31:57.640]  Speaking of somebody who is a sponsor, it's Shelekut out of Tibet.
[02:31:57.760 --> 02:31:59.240]  It is a mountain mineral.
[02:31:59.860 --> 02:32:03.742]  84 different types of ionic minerals in ionic mineral form.
[02:32:04.745 --> 02:32:09.427]  It is a great mineral tincture put into pill form.
[02:32:10.188 --> 02:32:12.749]  A great sponsor from Blacklistedherb.com.
[02:32:12.789 --> 02:32:13.929]  Blacklistedherb.com.
[02:32:14.229 --> 02:32:16.210]  The company is Solutions from Science.
[02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:17.371]  They have hundreds of great products.
[02:32:18.121 --> 02:32:21.924]  Uh, but, uh, this, uh, Shilakit and the Shilazine tablets, I'm taking it.
[02:32:22.605 --> 02:32:23.906]  Uh, Aaron's taking it here at the office.
[02:32:23.946 --> 02:32:25.127]  It's, it's just great stuff.
[02:32:25.547 --> 02:32:26.428]  And they want you to try it.
[02:32:26.468 --> 02:32:27.969]  A three-month supply, a bottle of it.
[02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:35.215]  No credit card, no nothing, just they'll send you an invoice, and if you like it, in three months, when you order the next bottle, pay for the first.
[02:32:35.797 --> 02:32:37.938]  You cannot beat that deal.
[02:32:37.958 --> 02:32:48.681]  1-877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, or blacklistedherb.com, blacklistedherb.com, or 877-327-0365.
[02:32:48.701 --> 02:33:02.966]  Going back, because I want to jam in a few of your final calls for those that are patiently holding and get to some of the international news we haven't covered yet, but going back to our guests, I've got to get back up for a full hour in the near future.
[02:33:03.804 --> 02:33:09.505]  I mean, I knew, as amazing as this magazine was, that the people behind it had to be amazing.
[02:33:09.525 --> 02:33:13.626]  And obviously, never heard of me, never heard of what we do, but we're on the same page.
[02:33:14.386 --> 02:33:18.747]  He's talking about Rome and the money supply and the very same international groups.
[02:33:18.787 --> 02:33:21.068]  I mean, if you study it, that's who it is.
[02:33:21.948 --> 02:33:23.528]  And it's a diabolical plan.
[02:33:23.548 --> 02:33:27.149]  Now, sir, I haven't asked you this, but were you aware
[02:33:28.323 --> 02:33:32.786]  Mr. Walters, about how this was all an internationalist plan to bring down the U.S.
[02:33:32.866 --> 02:33:35.047]  and the Western world to get us under their control?
[02:33:35.667 --> 02:33:42.051]  Well, I think I have about as good a working knowledge of everything from way, way back.
[02:33:42.652 --> 02:33:49.215]  You see, some of the problems we have were incubated long before there were Democrats and Republicans.
[02:33:51.177 --> 02:33:51.697]  Elaborate.
[02:33:54.736 --> 02:34:09.901]  Well, you go back to Cecil Rhodes, go back to the Council on Foreign Relations, go back to these sub-rosa government managers such as we're under right now.
[02:34:11.081 --> 02:34:15.862]  They have decided that we're going to dismantle the United States and they're doing it.
[02:34:16.623 --> 02:34:21.424]  What do you think we did when we signed on with World Trade Organization?
[02:34:22.062 --> 02:34:31.031]  When we signed on with NAFTA, when we destroyed the economy of Mexico and flushed millions of people across the border into the United States.
[02:34:32.713 --> 02:34:37.738]  This is all part of whatever they're trying to do.
[02:34:39.517 --> 02:34:40.778]  One world, I guess.
[02:34:41.398 --> 02:34:42.959]  You're absolutely on target.
[02:34:42.979 --> 02:34:47.042]  And again, there are people and publications like this all over the place.
[02:34:47.082 --> 02:34:48.363]  We just don't even know each other.
[02:34:48.383 --> 02:34:50.204]  We don't even know about... No, we don't.
[02:34:50.344 --> 02:34:55.447]  And one of the things we really need to know, we almost need to have a council.
[02:34:56.668 --> 02:34:59.590]  Council, I don't know, you have to come up with a name for it.
[02:35:00.250 --> 02:35:01.751]  Because we don't know each other.
[02:35:02.592 --> 02:35:05.334]  There are thousands of organizations out there.
[02:35:06.394 --> 02:35:08.836]  And we ought all at least know who we are.
[02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:17.444]  Well, the good news is... Maybe there's some differences in some cases, but the central thesis of it, I think, most these people are together.
[02:35:18.024 --> 02:35:18.625]  Absolutely.
[02:35:18.665 --> 02:35:21.806]  Well, I'm trying to bring you to our audience, 1-800-355-5313, to get a free sample copy.
[02:35:21.826 --> 02:35:22.927]  Ladies and gentlemen, 1-800-355-5313.
[02:35:22.947 --> 02:35:25.088]  Give them a call or give them a call tonight, tomorrow.
[02:35:25.148 --> 02:35:26.869]  How late is the office open over there?
[02:35:26.889 --> 02:35:27.710]  About five, I think.
[02:35:37.964 --> 02:35:43.966]  Okay, well, if it doesn't matter, they can leave it on the, you know, they have a tape running all night.
[02:35:44.307 --> 02:35:46.487]  Now, your name and address and where you want the sample copy?
[02:35:46.507 --> 02:35:47.568]  Yeah, that kind of thing.
[02:35:48.388 --> 02:35:56.991]  You know, in this period of time since producing Acres USA, I've written about 30 books, one of which is called Unforgiven.
[02:35:57.011 --> 02:36:05.775]  The people are a beast of muddy brain that knows not its own force, and therefore stands loaded with
[02:36:07.618 --> 02:36:08.418]  Wooden stone.
[02:36:08.658 --> 02:36:11.481]  A mere child guides it with bit and rain.
[02:36:12.381 --> 02:36:18.806]  What I do in that book is tell the whole story from the 1930s to approximately the present.
[02:36:20.187 --> 02:36:22.069]  And how it's been stitched together.
[02:36:22.089 --> 02:36:25.251]  And how this works.
[02:36:29.224 --> 02:36:31.526]  Do they have a copy of that for people to buy?
[02:36:31.846 --> 02:36:32.767]  It's still in print.
[02:36:33.887 --> 02:36:37.910]  But folks can call 1-800-355-5313 and probably buy a copy.
[02:36:38.110 --> 02:36:40.512]  Yeah, or you can ask for their book catalog.
[02:36:40.532 --> 02:36:41.713]  It's probably in there, too.
[02:36:42.453 --> 02:36:44.214]  I know there's still some of them in print.
[02:36:44.275 --> 02:36:45.335]  Not many, but a few.
[02:36:45.696 --> 02:36:46.956]  What are some of the other books you've written?
[02:36:48.337 --> 02:36:57.744]  Oh, uh, Fertility from the Ocean Deep is another book, and Minerals.
[02:36:58.641 --> 02:36:59.821]  And the genetic code.
[02:37:01.182 --> 02:37:06.363]  I worked on that with a doctor, Richard Ulrey, up in Michigan.
[02:37:06.603 --> 02:37:16.345]  You know, I was just talking about minerals, and one of our sponsors, I mean, and from my research, more and more it appears that they are, the mineral cofactors, all of those, are the absolute key to health.
[02:37:16.365 --> 02:37:17.365]  Can you tell me about it?
[02:37:17.845 --> 02:37:18.585]  Absolutely.
[02:37:19.085 --> 02:37:25.767]  For instance, right now you've got a big outbreak of brucellosis up in Montana, and the lady called me and says,
[02:37:26.590 --> 02:37:28.571]  They want to shoot all the cows, you know.
[02:37:29.311 --> 02:37:31.692]  I said, well, what is Brucellosis?
[02:37:31.772 --> 02:37:33.652]  And I said, well, it's Bang's disease.
[02:37:33.772 --> 02:37:35.333]  It's a nutritional disease.
[02:37:35.913 --> 02:37:39.234]  Those animals are a little bit sick, but you can feed them out of it.
[02:37:40.014 --> 02:37:43.175]  You have to give them the appropriate, and I gave it the exact measure.
[02:37:43.195 --> 02:37:43.975]  Well, I knew that.
[02:37:44.015 --> 02:37:52.098]  You just increase their salts and their... It's more, you have to, you may have to make sure that they get enough magnesium, manganese,
[02:37:52.631 --> 02:37:55.613]  Cobalt, Copper, Zinc, and Iodine, and Selenium.
[02:37:55.653 --> 02:37:58.374]  Yeah, by salts I meant the feed blocks.
[02:37:58.434 --> 02:37:59.655]  In salt form, yeah.
[02:37:59.875 --> 02:38:00.075]  Yeah.
[02:38:00.635 --> 02:38:08.599]  But, for instance, you take it right now we have a big pandemic in the United States of women with breast cancer.
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:16.623]  Well, women who never let their systems run out of Iodine and Selenium are not going to get breast cancer.
[02:38:17.004 --> 02:38:19.605]  Now, this isn't off-the-wall stuff I'm giving you.
[02:38:20.145 --> 02:38:21.726]  This is disciplined
[02:38:22.963 --> 02:38:26.326]  Triple R, SSPRP, research.
[02:38:26.707 --> 02:38:30.530]  It's up on the shelves, but it doesn't do the pharmaceutical companies any good.
[02:38:30.730 --> 02:38:33.592]  No, no, they want you debased, so then they can sell your products.
[02:38:33.672 --> 02:38:36.315]  And they cold-bloodedly say it, too.
[02:38:36.415 --> 02:38:49.826]  They want everybody hooked on some dope and some pharmaceuticals of some sort, especially during their declining years, because they need to excise the swelling in their wallets.
[02:38:53.207 --> 02:38:54.468]  Oh my gosh, exactly.
[02:38:54.508 --> 02:38:57.290]  Think about the global system and the Rockefellers got big into health.
[02:38:58.471 --> 02:39:02.614]  You're probably quite familiar right now with the Codex Alimentarius.
[02:39:03.315 --> 02:39:08.859]  Oh, they're moving right now to start shutting down alternative... They want to restrict even mainline minerals and vitamins.
[02:39:09.139 --> 02:39:11.061]  Oh yeah, that's been plugged in in Canada.
[02:39:11.141 --> 02:39:12.782]  It's been plugged in in Germany.
[02:39:13.463 --> 02:39:15.865]  And of course, we've plugged it in now.
[02:39:15.905 --> 02:39:18.827]  We haven't actually implemented it and so on, but that's coming.
[02:39:19.673 --> 02:39:31.842]  They're going to go right after everybody and a lot of these pharmaceuticals, a lot of these mineral companies, and these organic preparation companies are sitting there completely asleep.
[02:39:31.922 --> 02:39:35.264]  They think, oh it can't happen, this is not for us, this is something else.
[02:39:35.924 --> 02:39:36.985]  Well they better wake up.
[02:39:37.025 --> 02:39:37.946]  Let me give you an example.
[02:39:38.661 --> 02:39:44.103]  The media is still saying there's no move to ban free speech on talk radio, the so-called Fairness Doctrine.
[02:39:44.563 --> 02:39:48.864]  They have introduced a resolution to try to block it because they are trying to reinstate it.
[02:39:49.324 --> 02:39:54.826]  I have The Hill newspaper saying a vote to block the Fairness Doctrine failed.
[02:39:55.126 --> 02:39:59.827]  They're moving ahead with it, and I can't get the general public to believe it's even happening, Chuck.
[02:39:59.847 --> 02:40:00.688]  They won't believe it.
[02:40:00.908 --> 02:40:02.728]  They won't believe it until it happens.
[02:40:04.009 --> 02:40:04.829]  Then it's too late.
[02:40:05.620 --> 02:40:11.602]  Right now, you have people talking about this MAIS, National Animal Identification System.
[02:40:12.002 --> 02:40:16.524]  They say, well, it doesn't hurt to volunteer and go along with it, but we don't want to make it mandatory.
[02:40:16.544 --> 02:40:17.524]  But it isn't volunteering.
[02:40:17.565 --> 02:40:23.847]  They're telling, because it isn't the law, it's a regulation, they're telling the 4-H clubs, you've got to have this.
[02:40:24.347 --> 02:40:27.768]  And then when you say premises, that means under U.S.
[02:40:27.848 --> 02:40:31.970]  code, you don't own your property, and you've contracted in under the regulatory control.
[02:40:32.660 --> 02:40:34.321]  Everybody's going along with it.
[02:40:34.501 --> 02:40:43.266]  Nobody's paying attention, except there's a guy you need to get on your radio program up in Michigan named Newendorf.
[02:40:43.326 --> 02:40:44.266]  Greg Newendorf.
[02:40:45.387 --> 02:40:46.328]  I believe we have Greg on.
[02:40:47.368 --> 02:40:48.189]  You have had him on?
[02:40:48.369 --> 02:40:48.589]  Yeah.
[02:40:49.209 --> 02:40:49.569]  Good.
[02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:52.791]  Well, we've been counseling quite a bit.
[02:40:53.772 --> 02:40:57.994]  My major counsel to any of these people is, look, I know you can't
[02:40:58.570 --> 02:41:03.134]  There's no point talking ugly or anything like that.
[02:41:03.534 --> 02:41:04.895]  There's one thing you can do.
[02:41:06.016 --> 02:41:16.144]  And it's like what the Polish Pope told the Polish people back during the days of solidarity.
[02:41:16.164 --> 02:41:23.330]  He says, your freedom depends on your willingness to stand up against these things.
[02:41:24.211 --> 02:41:26.353]  In other words, don't cooperate so much.
[02:41:27.458 --> 02:41:28.498]  Don't knuckle under.
[02:41:28.779 --> 02:41:30.159]  Stop being a trembler.
[02:41:30.339 --> 02:41:31.560]  That's what he was telling them.
[02:41:33.100 --> 02:41:33.800]  And what happened?
[02:41:34.461 --> 02:41:35.841]  The government fell, didn't it?
[02:41:37.382 --> 02:41:41.123]  We've got ranchers out there that have made a career of being tremblers.
[02:41:42.664 --> 02:41:48.206]  They come around, they want to identify your property and tag your cattle a certain way and everything else.
[02:41:48.806 --> 02:41:51.768]  And I don't want any trouble with those people, and so they comply.
[02:41:52.108 --> 02:41:53.828]  You're gonna get trouble if you comply!
[02:41:53.848 --> 02:41:55.409]  Huh?
[02:41:55.993 --> 02:41:57.633]  Yeah, well, yeah, you're walking into it.
[02:41:58.134 --> 02:42:08.196]  You're like the kid that walks into the interrogation room in a police station without any assistance or counsel or any personal history of anything like that.
[02:42:08.797 --> 02:42:15.359]  And they'll have him saying things that are exactly opposite to his interests, and they'll have him say it on camera.
[02:42:15.459 --> 02:42:23.841]  Listen, that's how I woke up, because I was a pretty good growing up, and I got in fistfights and drank a little beer, but I mean, I didn't steal things, and I didn't, you know, do bad stuff.
[02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:35.366]  And I had the cops, and they were doing it to everybody, you know, take me into the principal's office and say, we know you stole all this, and we got witnesses that say you did it, and I was smart enough to go.
[02:42:36.326 --> 02:42:38.427]  And they said, just admit you did it and we'll let you go.
[02:42:38.447 --> 02:42:42.310]  And I said, but I'm not going to lie and say, I don't even know what you're... I've never even been where you... Yes, you did.
[02:42:42.410 --> 02:42:43.630]  Now you really are in deep.
[02:42:43.911 --> 02:42:45.512]  And then he got mad and said, get out of here.
[02:42:45.532 --> 02:42:46.412]  We're going to get you.
[02:42:46.792 --> 02:42:48.313]  And it turned out they didn't have witnesses.
[02:42:48.353 --> 02:42:49.354]  He just made it up.
[02:42:49.374 --> 02:42:50.315]  Of course, they made it up.
[02:42:50.335 --> 02:42:58.459]  They were just going to ruin my life so they could just, for no reason... I tell anybody that's got that problem, I say, we've got to come in and talk to the police.
[02:42:59.020 --> 02:43:01.781]  I say, wait a minute, is this a friendly chat or not?
[02:43:02.002 --> 02:43:04.163]  If it's friendly, let's do it in our backyard.
[02:43:04.203 --> 02:43:05.784]  We don't need to do it at the police station.
[02:43:06.371 --> 02:43:13.642]  If it isn't friendly, I have a right to silence, and I do not wish to abdicate that right.
[02:43:14.584 --> 02:43:16.367]  That's what we should be teaching everybody.
[02:43:17.206 --> 02:43:21.287]  It holds for the police, it holds for the government, it holds for USDA.
[02:43:21.567 --> 02:43:24.048]  Well I tell you, you are one of my new favorite guests.
[02:43:24.088 --> 02:43:29.449]  I had a feeling it would be interesting, because again, I'd only read your magazine three times and read some online stuff.
[02:43:29.469 --> 02:43:30.489]  It was all pure gold.
[02:43:31.749 --> 02:43:34.390]  And now I know why, because you're the founder of it.
[02:43:34.850 --> 02:43:36.050]  I want to get you on, sir.
[02:43:36.070 --> 02:43:38.511]  I want to get on anybody else you recommend from your organization.
[02:43:39.091 --> 02:43:45.376]  And I know you're retired now in just an advisory capacity, but I want to get you back on as a guest.
[02:43:45.396 --> 02:43:49.519]  1-800-355-5313 to call get a free issue of AcresUSA.
[02:43:49.539 --> 02:43:49.860]  1-800-355-5313.
[02:43:49.900 --> 02:44:00.288]  And the website, there's a link to it up on InfoWars.com if you forget it, but it's AcresUSA.com.
[02:44:00.748 --> 02:44:04.191]  And I want to get you up in the next few weeks for a full hour to take some calls.
[02:44:04.491 --> 02:44:06.353]  Maybe you can be a regular contributor to come on and
[02:44:06.773 --> 02:44:07.093]  Ok, anytime.
[02:44:07.133 --> 02:44:07.313]  Ok, bye.
[02:44:36.721 --> 02:44:45.243]  Yeah, I don't know, it was a couple years ago I read an issue of it, and then I came across another issue, and then I talked to people who had it, and then I saw some family that had a copy.
[02:44:45.903 --> 02:44:50.224]  And then I heard George Gordon salivating all over it a few months ago on the radio here locally.
[02:44:51.104 --> 02:44:57.386]  And, you know, I said I wanted Calvin for himself as a sponsor, and I went and got him.
[02:44:57.546 --> 02:45:00.446]  I want them as a sponsor, and they're nuts if they don't become a sponsor.
[02:45:00.946 --> 02:45:03.967]  Because I believe in the product, and I want to pitch it to everybody, and I want everybody to get it.
[02:45:05.234 --> 02:45:07.075]  I'll just be flat out honest with everybody.
[02:45:07.275 --> 02:45:08.616]  But now I'm going to have that guy back up.
[02:45:09.136 --> 02:45:10.797]  I was like, I'm going to have him on a bit to become a sponsor.
[02:45:10.817 --> 02:45:12.278]  But I said, I bet it's going to be interesting.
[02:45:12.678 --> 02:45:15.279]  And they said, yeah, it's some older fella.
[02:45:16.140 --> 02:45:17.461]  And I said, oh yeah, it's going to be great.
[02:45:17.581 --> 02:45:19.402]  And see, he's got all the knowledge.
[02:45:19.442 --> 02:45:20.842]  Never talked to him, never anything.
[02:45:20.862 --> 02:45:22.243]  And he's around the same page as we are.
[02:45:22.623 --> 02:45:24.264]  Because it's the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:24.524 --> 02:45:25.365]  It's the New World Order.
[02:45:25.585 --> 02:45:26.725]  All right, I know we've got people holding.
[02:45:26.765 --> 02:45:27.946]  Let's jam in their calls.
[02:45:28.306 --> 02:45:29.487]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:45:31.315 --> 02:45:33.456]  George in Indiana, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:45:33.476 --> 02:45:33.856]  Go ahead.
[02:45:34.256 --> 02:45:34.976]  Yeah, you hear me?
[02:45:35.256 --> 02:45:35.877]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[02:45:36.597 --> 02:45:42.979]  I've got a request or maybe a challenge to all the pseudo Oliver Norths out there, Alex.
[02:45:44.219 --> 02:45:48.461]  Look, Ollie, you know evidence about the 9-11.
[02:45:48.581 --> 02:45:50.561]  You could make that house of cards fall.
[02:45:51.482 --> 02:45:54.183]  And let me tell you, you're not part of the club.
[02:45:54.343 --> 02:45:55.263]  You won't retire.
[02:45:55.623 --> 02:45:58.304]  When you become not useful, they're going to kill you.
[02:45:58.712 --> 02:45:59.672]  Look at the DU.
[02:45:59.752 --> 02:46:03.374]  Look at all the boys coming back from Iraq and they're over there in that DU.
[02:46:03.414 --> 02:46:05.934]  Look at the New York firefighters, now they're taking care of them.
[02:46:06.595 --> 02:46:08.155]  Honest to God, step up.
[02:46:08.215 --> 02:46:09.115]  Do it for your mother.
[02:46:09.155 --> 02:46:11.256]  Do it for your grandmother or for your children.
[02:46:11.896 --> 02:46:17.878]  Get out and put this information out that's going to bring these criminals to justice.
[02:46:18.358 --> 02:46:23.500]  Because if you don't, it's going to be too late down the road and you're going to be so sorry.
[02:46:24.436 --> 02:46:26.062]  That's really all I wanted to say, Alex.
[02:46:26.102 --> 02:46:26.865]  I just want... Why?
[02:46:26.905 --> 02:46:29.977]  What did you hear that fake conservative doing that made you want to call in about him?
[02:46:32.107 --> 02:46:33.008]  It's all I hear.
[02:46:33.068 --> 02:46:35.410]  I turn on the Fox News.
[02:46:35.490 --> 02:46:36.972]  I just can't stand them anymore.
[02:46:36.992 --> 02:46:39.914]  They have that show with war stories and how they love the boys.
[02:46:40.254 --> 02:46:41.816]  The New World Order calls them cattle.
[02:46:42.056 --> 02:46:43.597]  Kissinger called them dumb animals.
[02:46:44.598 --> 02:46:47.861]  They'll smile at you to your face and call you dumb animals behind your back.
[02:46:48.221 --> 02:46:50.543]  I'll look at you right in the eye and say, you better stop it.
[02:46:50.903 --> 02:46:52.945]  That goes for the FBI, the cops, all of you.
[02:46:53.165 --> 02:46:53.766]  They don't care.
[02:46:53.826 --> 02:46:56.188]  And listen, a lot of these people go, yeah, we know it's evil.
[02:46:56.508 --> 02:46:58.889]  But we take care of our families by being on the winning side.
[02:46:59.209 --> 02:47:01.570]  There's no winning side in this thing, man!
[02:47:01.590 --> 02:47:02.130]  Nope.
[02:47:02.390 --> 02:47:03.731]  Not unless you're a trillionaire.
[02:47:04.951 --> 02:47:05.531]  And that's it.
[02:47:05.811 --> 02:47:07.152]  Let me tell you, it's not even winning for them.
[02:47:07.192 --> 02:47:08.232]  These people are nuts.
[02:47:08.512 --> 02:47:11.393]  I have come to the realization they are flat out nuts.
[02:47:12.534 --> 02:47:18.216]  They're going according to a paradigm drawn up over a hundred years ago by their science fiction writer futurist.
[02:47:19.216 --> 02:47:20.176]  Literally, H.G.
[02:47:20.216 --> 02:47:24.758]  Wells and others got the royal families to adopt science fiction plans, he had, and they're doing it.
[02:47:25.826 --> 02:47:28.408]  I mean, it's so weird, you can't even believe it.
[02:47:28.728 --> 02:47:29.808]  We are in deep trouble.
[02:47:30.229 --> 02:47:31.930]  I don't know how anybody could deny it.
[02:47:33.170 --> 02:47:33.971]  They can't deny it.
[02:47:34.011 --> 02:47:34.811]  They're just scared.
[02:47:34.911 --> 02:47:36.432]  What they need to do is step up now.
[02:47:36.892 --> 02:47:42.856]  If you're afraid that you're going to get locked up or whatever, put the information out.
[02:47:42.936 --> 02:47:43.916]  Give it to somebody.
[02:47:44.096 --> 02:47:44.476]  Send it.
[02:47:44.717 --> 02:47:52.401]  And in an anonymous letter, there's somebody out there that has information that would bring that house of cards down.
[02:47:52.441 --> 02:47:54.362]  There's just absolutely no doubt about it.
[02:47:55.237 --> 02:47:57.918]  And we need it now, because I've been seeing all of these movies.
[02:47:57.978 --> 02:47:59.778]  I watch every one of them.
[02:48:00.118 --> 02:48:02.059]  I'm glued to my computer because of my job.
[02:48:02.379 --> 02:48:05.640]  So I'm eight to ten hours a day watching your movies over and over and over.
[02:48:06.180 --> 02:48:07.380]  All of these 9-11 movies.
[02:48:07.420 --> 02:48:10.401]  There's enough out there, but we need somebody to step up.
[02:48:10.621 --> 02:48:14.282]  We need that guy that came in there and told Cheney the plane is ten miles out.
[02:48:14.682 --> 02:48:17.882]  And if you're listening to this, you need to turn around right now.
[02:48:20.383 --> 02:48:21.283]  I hear you, brother.
[02:48:21.323 --> 02:48:22.183]  I appreciate the call.
[02:48:23.044 --> 02:48:24.304]  I'm just challenging police.
[02:48:25.672 --> 02:48:28.655]  To go type eugenics Bertrand Russell into Google.
[02:48:29.456 --> 02:48:30.937]  Or eugenics IBM in.
[02:48:31.037 --> 02:48:32.399]  I mean, they run everything.
[02:48:32.519 --> 02:48:35.141]  I mean, folks, they are cold-blooded.
[02:48:36.142 --> 02:48:39.205]  And I can't believe the FBI knows this stuff is going along with it.
[02:48:39.245 --> 02:48:40.126]  They just don't know.
[02:48:40.146 --> 02:48:41.948]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:49.242 --> 02:48:54.690]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:55.091 --> 02:49:02.722]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.416 --> 02:49:10.460]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:22.306]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.606 --> 02:49:26.068]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.569 --> 02:49:28.510]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.830 --> 02:49:32.672]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:48.924 --> 02:49:51.706]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:51.986 --> 02:49:56.149]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:56.570 --> 02:49:57.410]  So what do you do?
[02:49:57.710 --> 02:50:02.274]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:50:02.754 --> 02:50:04.876]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:50:05.376 --> 02:50:20.089]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:50:20.129 --> 02:50:27.175]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:50:27.515 --> 02:50:31.920]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[02:50:46.116 --> 02:50:58.061]  JLS Research, the makers of the all-natural and very effective No-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates that those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[02:50:58.221 --> 02:51:04.804]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[02:51:05.064 --> 02:51:12.449]  By using organic and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[02:51:12.789 --> 02:51:15.851]  As it responds, body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[02:51:16.132 --> 02:51:19.774]  First Responder is the first of its kind, comprised of only four organics.
[02:51:20.074 --> 02:51:23.457]  Grape seed skins, grape seed, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[02:51:23.737 --> 02:51:28.340]  It's so effective, you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[02:51:28.680 --> 02:51:30.121]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[02:51:31.562 --> 02:51:35.167]  Go online and order First Responder at No-BO.com.
[02:51:35.287 --> 02:51:38.632]  Visit No-BO.com or call JLS Research at 850-723-8599.
[02:51:38.692 --> 02:51:38.972]  That's 850-723-8599.
[02:51:57.603 --> 02:51:58.464]  I just did a test.
[02:51:58.564 --> 02:52:00.465]  Acres USA is a pretty big outfit here in Austin.
[02:52:00.505 --> 02:52:00.885]  I called.
[02:52:00.905 --> 02:52:01.765]  Their phone's busy.
[02:52:02.106 --> 02:52:08.229]  So you might try later to get your free issue at 1-800-355-5313.
[02:52:08.489 --> 02:52:09.630]  Or just go to their website.
[02:52:09.690 --> 02:52:12.591]  You can email them and ask for a free issue there.
[02:52:13.592 --> 02:52:16.574]  You can find it in their contact info at acresusa.com.
[02:52:16.934 --> 02:52:18.475]  Don't forget, Terror Storm is out.
[02:52:18.515 --> 02:52:19.415]  The special edition.
[02:52:19.435 --> 02:52:20.196]  The final cut.
[02:52:21.056 --> 02:52:22.437]  17 minutes of new film.
[02:52:22.737 --> 02:52:24.538]  And the whole thing remastered and updated.
[02:52:25.819 --> 02:52:34.746]  It's available on DVD at InfoWars.com or for immediate flash player or real player or Windows Media, all the latest.
[02:52:35.166 --> 02:52:38.849]  It's got the Mac version up there, too, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:39.189 --> 02:52:40.610]  Let's talk to Chris in Florida.
[02:52:40.630 --> 02:52:41.491]  You're on the air, Chris.
[02:52:41.531 --> 02:52:41.951]  Go ahead.
[02:52:41.971 --> 02:52:50.778]  If the sun is heating up, as you say, Alex, then why don't we see rivers of cheese flowing into the seas of the moon?
[02:52:54.045 --> 02:52:56.727]  Question a la David Rothschild.
[02:52:57.948 --> 02:53:06.933]  I wanted to point out that the so-called frontrunners in the Republican Party, when you look at meetup.com, they're really not represented at all.
[02:53:08.774 --> 02:53:15.339]  Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and Mitt Romney all together have about 60 people in their collective groups.
[02:53:16.119 --> 02:53:18.521]  And then Duncan Hunter has 17.
[02:53:18.561 --> 02:53:20.062]  And then Ron Paul has more than 10,000.
[02:53:21.261 --> 02:53:27.446]  Oh yeah, you look at Ron Paul and I'm seeing multiple groups just in my county, Hillsborough County.
[02:53:27.887 --> 02:53:37.175]  I know Austin has about 600 members just in its meetup, New York had a couple thousand, LA's got a couple thousand, I'm just guessing 10,000, it's probably 20-something thousand, but again,
[02:53:37.956 --> 02:53:47.382]  I can go on Good Morning America, I can go on CNN, and literally no increase in hits when I plug websites, no increase in people visiting, checking us out.
[02:53:47.642 --> 02:53:54.707]  But I go on a mom-and-pop Christian station, 1000 watts, in a small town where people care, huge response.
[02:53:55.207 --> 02:53:56.548]  And see, that's the difference.
[02:53:57.068 --> 02:54:01.731]  They can put out their stuff to the mind-numb zombies that watch TV, no response.
[02:54:02.291 --> 02:54:10.335]  You see, that's why the other 10 candidates had 200 people in Iowa and Ron Paul had 800 at his thing next door.
[02:54:10.615 --> 02:54:13.256]  It's because, see, they're saying he doesn't show up.
[02:54:13.276 --> 02:54:18.658]  He doesn't show up at 1% or 2% in the mind-numbed groups that they specifically are polling.
[02:54:19.559 --> 02:54:20.319]  Right, the phone polls.
[02:54:20.399 --> 02:54:23.761]  I read a good article on your website today.
[02:54:24.061 --> 02:54:26.202]  Yeah, it's two different universes.
[02:54:26.542 --> 02:54:31.384]  We've got, as Mark Kornke always used to say, we've got the thinkers, they've got the stinkers.
[02:54:32.262 --> 02:54:32.422]  Right.
[02:54:32.982 --> 02:54:43.127]  And also, if someone from his party is listening, the Lionel Show has been trying to get in touch with him at least three times and they gave up.
[02:54:43.647 --> 02:54:50.191]  So if they want to go to airamerica.com slash Lionel and get in touch with him, he has a nationally syndicated show.
[02:54:50.231 --> 02:54:52.171]  He just went over to Air America.
[02:54:52.412 --> 02:54:52.952]  I understand.
[02:54:53.012 --> 02:54:53.972]  Listen, we've got to jump.
[02:54:54.012 --> 02:54:54.753]  It's frustrating.
[02:54:55.233 --> 02:54:57.214]  Ron Paul is doing 20, 30 interviews a day.
[02:54:57.254 --> 02:54:59.555]  He's exhausting himself at 72 years of age.
[02:55:00.793 --> 02:55:05.897]  Uh, and we just need to pray for him, and I know he can't do everything, and I know it's frustrating for all these talk show hosts.
[02:55:05.958 --> 02:55:08.900]  It's frustrating for us, you know, to only be able to get them on once a month.
[02:55:08.980 --> 02:55:10.741]  But, uh, we just gotta give Ron Paul a break.
[02:55:11.182 --> 02:55:12.463]  Okay, final caller here.
[02:55:13.023 --> 02:55:15.886]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to Ed in Pennsylvania.
[02:55:15.906 --> 02:55:16.566]  Go ahead, Ed.
[02:55:17.887 --> 02:55:22.771]  Alex, in, um, Philadelphia, you can get a little row house with a 20-foot square yard for $200,000.
[02:55:22.911 --> 02:55:30.037]  Or you could come out here in the country, and you can get a 100-acre farm with a house and a barn on it.
[02:55:30.666 --> 02:55:31.067]  For $200,000.
[02:55:31.207 --> 02:55:34.069]  Out here in the boonies.
[02:55:34.430 --> 02:55:40.736]  And by the way, appreciation-wise, the farm stuff is now starting to go up even faster than inside the cities.
[02:55:41.296 --> 02:55:45.000]  It'd be a very good move for people to buy themselves a piece of property, and quickly.
[02:55:45.040 --> 02:55:45.500]  Anything else?
[02:55:47.142 --> 02:55:49.484]  Western PA's still pretty free.
[02:55:49.544 --> 02:55:51.226]  New Jersey's a total police state.
[02:55:51.366 --> 02:55:51.746]  Oh, I know.
[02:55:51.786 --> 02:55:52.527]  They're the worst, yeah.
[02:55:53.708 --> 02:55:54.689]  Thanks for being out.
[02:55:55.643 --> 02:55:56.563]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:55:56.623 --> 02:56:00.765]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight on the network, 24 hours a day at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:00.805 --> 02:56:02.965]  You can listen to the streams or the free podcast.
[02:56:03.285 --> 02:56:04.906]  Help us get the word out.
[02:56:05.426 --> 02:56:07.827]  We try to bring in people like AcresUSA and all these other folks.
[02:56:07.887 --> 02:56:08.947]  We are changing everybody.
[02:56:09.227 --> 02:56:10.027]  Try to build them up.
[02:56:10.127 --> 02:56:13.008]  Help build us up so we can energize everybody else.
[02:56:13.108 --> 02:56:16.489]  It's a synergy we're trying to build here and we're doing it thanks to you.
[02:56:17.029 --> 02:56:18.490]  God bless you all, my friends.
[02:56:18.610 --> 02:56:20.610]  Spread the new terror storm to the four winds.
[02:56:21.511 --> 02:56:23.051]  Get out there and take on the new world order.
[02:56:25.848 --> 02:56:30.492]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
