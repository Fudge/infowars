[00:00:05.787 --> 00:00:06.427]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:08.148]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:09.990]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.431]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.192 --> 00:00:13.232]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.753 --> 00:00:17.736]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.936 --> 00:00:22.079]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.722]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:30.166]  I have a huge broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:32.227]  Very important information coming up.
[00:00:35.399 --> 00:01:02.826]  Rosie O'Donnell this morning just about 15 minutes ago did a nine minute rant on 9-11 being an inside job to 30 million viewers predominantly women who are now going to make this the number one topic of discussion at their workplace coast-to-coast border-to-border going into Canada and worldwide I have talked to
[00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:22.227]  Christine Ebersole who is a good personal friend of Rosie and she said that Rosie was planning to go public very very soon and we were in contact with Rosie's people to get her on the show in the near future but that she was going to decide what she was going to do when she went on vacation to Florida next week.
[00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:26.804]  Obviously, she decided to just go ahead and go public.
[00:01:26.944 --> 00:01:29.964]  I saw her on her video blog yesterday.
[00:01:29.984 --> 00:01:46.508]  I sent this to my writers and to my webmasters, and I have no idea why it's not up, but she went ahead and started talking about false flag terror in that video blog, and then today she went public with a nine-minute rant.
[00:01:46.568 --> 00:01:52.049]  We are working on getting it at another one of my employees'
[00:01:52.822 --> 00:01:53.843]  We're good to go.
[00:02:09.187 --> 00:02:13.051]  Before anybody says, who cares what Rosie O'Donnell says, it isn't about Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:16.994]  It's about the fact that 30 million people have now heard her bring up pertinent points.
[00:02:17.294 --> 00:02:19.196]  They've heard her talk about the implosion of Building 7.
[00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:24.401]  They've heard her talk about false flag, government-sponsored terror for nine minutes.
[00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:34.430]  And she's very cogent, and she's covering very salient, central points to 9-11, and not any of the diversionary or distracting issues
[00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.756]  of pods and laser beams and flying saucers and the rest of it.
[00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:46.260]  She is getting directly in to the history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:50.184]  She has seen Terror Storm.
[00:02:50.304 --> 00:02:52.325]  She has seen Loose Change Second Edition.
[00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:55.168]  She is aware of the New World Order.
[00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:57.150]  She's having her paradigm shifted.
[00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:01.734]  Yesterday in her own blog, her video blog,
[00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:06.132]  She said, will I even be on The View next season?
[00:03:06.692 --> 00:03:12.394]  Well, I'm going on vacation and we gotta have some family time with the family.
[00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:17.076]  And she took in a big deep breath and believe me, this wasn't acting.
[00:03:17.476 --> 00:03:20.877]  This was her making the decision, I guess, to go public yesterday.
[00:03:24.598 --> 00:03:27.139]  By the way, I sent you that link, Network.
[00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:28.519]  Did you get the Rosie link?
[00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:30.400]  Do you have that from her video blog?
[00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.575]  I mean, do you know how to locate it, or is it in your IM?
[00:03:38.177 --> 00:03:39.598]  And a lot of this is my fault, folks.
[00:03:39.638 --> 00:03:41.820]  I'm unprofessional, but it's because I'm working too much.
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.146]  I was working until 1 o'clock last night, and I was scheduled to do some radio interview this morning.
[00:03:49.206 --> 00:03:49.907]  I didn't do it.
[00:03:49.927 --> 00:03:50.888]  I slept in.
[00:03:50.908 --> 00:03:52.829]  I was scheduled to be on Rent Sprop Monday.
[00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:53.410]  I didn't do it.
[00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.053]  Because I'm expected to do everything, and I can't do everything.
[00:03:57.711 --> 00:03:58.651]  I can't do it all.
[00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:06.835]  I'm fighting as hard as I can to fight the New World Order, but it's kind of like flying a helicopter that hadn't had its maintenance hours and has got parts falling off of it.
[00:04:08.155 --> 00:04:20.340]  And we can bring these bastards down, but there aren't enough dedicated people, there aren't enough focused people that know how to take them down, who are willing to put the hours in and do what it takes to engage the New World Order.
[00:04:23.706 --> 00:04:27.648]  If you don't have it in your IM, just go to music and I'll go IM it to you again.
[00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:34.530]  Because... Because I just can't deal with it anymore.
[00:04:39.432 --> 00:04:48.196]  Alright, um... Meanwhile, you've got giant government kidnapping rings operating with almost total impunity.
[00:04:49.073 --> 00:04:53.894]  But their excesses have become public from time to time, so they are getting in a little bit of trouble.
[00:04:55.215 --> 00:04:57.215]  Well, uh, that's coming up later as well.
[00:04:57.275 --> 00:05:00.376]  Stay with me.
[00:05:01.637 --> 00:05:09.879]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:17.821]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.634]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.035 --> 00:05:37.462]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.782 --> 00:05:41.364]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.724 --> 00:05:43.665]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.005 --> 00:05:47.848]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:20.102 --> 00:06:23.526]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:06:23.846 --> 00:06:33.213]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Perky's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:06:33.474 --> 00:06:36.956]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:44.302]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:07:01.201 --> 00:07:03.542]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:03.802 --> 00:07:05.823]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:05.983 --> 00:07:13.147]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:07:13.287 --> 00:07:21.831]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[00:08:02.808 --> 00:08:08.809]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.429 --> 00:08:12.470]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:20.312]  You know, I know a lot of people in the Truth Movement, the 9-11 Truth Movement, the Patriot Movement, the Truth Movement, whatever you want to call it.
[00:08:21.712 --> 00:08:23.172]  To them, it's like a social thing.
[00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:23.913]  It's fun.
[00:08:25.793 --> 00:08:26.993]  It's who their friends are.
[00:08:27.053 --> 00:08:28.174]  It's their identity.
[00:08:28.894 --> 00:08:29.834]  It's their club.
[00:08:30.723 --> 00:08:33.405]  Well, you need to know this is a club that can get you killed.
[00:08:34.165 --> 00:08:37.307]  You know, this is a club that can get you put in a FEMA camp.
[00:08:37.908 --> 00:08:38.908]  This isn't a joke.
[00:08:38.988 --> 00:08:40.069]  This isn't a game.
[00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:42.030]  This is the real deal, okay?
[00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:53.678]  We're fighting very evil people, and this is the real world, and this is basically the end of free humanity if these people win.
[00:08:53.698 --> 00:08:57.300]  And I just want everybody to remember that
[00:08:58.527 --> 00:09:09.019]  And I want the listeners to understand and really get it boiled down in their brain, down to the pit of their stomach, that this is a fight for all the marbles.
[00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:15.026]  This is the real deal.
[00:09:17.685 --> 00:09:33.950]  To all the scum and all the trash and all the weak-minded people out there who can't look at the world and who can't see what's happening because they're not sophisticated enough or they're stupid or they're self-centered or they're cowardly because they rationalize and make excuses to themselves.
[00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.032]  For all of those people out there, I really pity you.
[00:09:40.832 --> 00:09:43.733]  I do, because we've got to get real.
[00:09:44.685 --> 00:10:04.015]  There is a power-mad elite that is going for broke who are obsessed with eugenics and culling populations and whose entire world is about putting a world government in place so they can kill masses of people
[00:10:04.967 --> 00:10:05.568]  Unhindered.
[00:10:05.988 --> 00:10:06.689]  Unrestricted.
[00:10:07.289 --> 00:10:12.994]  A world government is being put into place so there is no army that can stand against it.
[00:10:13.054 --> 00:10:15.616]  So there's no free country that can resist it.
[00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:29.968]  This is an elite that learned from Napoleon and Caesar and Alexander the Great and Hitler and the Soviets and from every other campaign of imperialists throughout history
[00:10:31.488 --> 00:10:53.173]  from those that wish to dominate and rule the world, they've learned from that and created a scientific dictatorship of the mind and a physical dictatorship where they anesthetize the population with illegal and legal drugs and rich foods and just masses of entertainment.
[00:10:56.554 --> 00:10:57.154]  But we've always
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:04.024]  He stated that as things got worse and worse, you would see many people in positions of power.
[00:11:04.785 --> 00:11:22.897]  You would see many people in government, and in Hollywood, and in the clergy, and in academia, throw off the propaganda, throw off the conditioning as the heat got higher and higher, and really take the blinders off and see the matrix for what it was.
[00:11:25.502 --> 00:11:52.704]  And it was people like Charlie Sheen, and people like Rosie O'Donnell, and people like Andres von Bulow, German Defense Minister, and members of the Bush Administration, and so many countless others, and former CIA analysts, and on and on and on, and engineers, and underwriting laboratory engineers, and police officers, and firemen, and emergency workers, who were going, you know what?
[00:11:54.059 --> 00:11:58.522]  What you're hearing in the news, what you're told as the official story, is not the case.
[00:12:00.844 --> 00:12:20.838]  And there are Texas Rangers, and there are social workers, and there are people in the system who aren't going to go along with what's happening, and aren't going to be told to sit down and shut up, and who are going to go through the threats and the incrimination, and who are going to stand tall and tell the truth.
[00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:26.812]  And it doesn't mean these individuals that stand up are perfect.
[00:12:26.832 --> 00:12:28.872]  It doesn't mean that they're without blemish.
[00:12:29.932 --> 00:12:34.873]  But it means that they are disgusted and they have the courage to stand up and tell the truth.
[00:12:38.414 --> 00:12:39.034]  It's that simple.
[00:12:40.554 --> 00:12:43.435]  Let me give everybody the newsflash here.
[00:12:43.475 --> 00:12:46.416]  We need to get a report out on this on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:50.317 --> 00:12:52.257]  That Rosie O'Donnell went on air today
[00:12:53.032 --> 00:13:00.734]  and talked in detail about building seven being imploded and being controlled in militia and no modern steel buildings ever falling until that day.
[00:13:00.834 --> 00:13:13.737]  She went into false flag terror in the Gulf of Tonkin and the history of government-sponsored terror that has been done again, problem, reaction, solution and that it's very suspicious what's happening with these British sailors right now and the build-up to war.
[00:13:14.937 --> 00:13:21.139]  And you dovetail that with her video blog yesterday where she takes a deep breath and says, will I be on the view
[00:13:22.205 --> 00:13:27.826]  Next season, and she takes in a big gulp of air and says, I've got to talk to the family about that.
[00:13:28.446 --> 00:13:32.047]  But obviously, she's finally had real success.
[00:13:32.087 --> 00:13:35.788]  The show is number one in the time slot, 30 million viewers.
[00:13:35.808 --> 00:13:42.089]  That's as big as broadcast TV gets, unless you're talking about special events like the Super Bowl with 65 million.
[00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:51.231]  And she went on there and probably, and she's hoping more are about to go public,
[00:13:51.855 --> 00:13:53.716]  She's hoping that more take action.
[00:13:54.676 --> 00:13:56.497]  She's hoping that it causes a domino effect.
[00:13:56.577 --> 00:14:03.900]  If it doesn't cause a big domino effect in the near term, Rosie O'Donnell will be cancelled from The View, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:11.663]  So she's put our career and millions and millions of dollars a year on the line.
[00:14:14.164 --> 00:14:17.205]  And please don't email me and say, well, she's a gun control freak.
[00:14:17.685 --> 00:14:19.846]  Haven't heard a lot of that out of her lately, have you?
[00:14:20.891 --> 00:14:22.892]  I've talked to people that know her personally.
[00:14:22.952 --> 00:14:25.033]  In fact, I'm very close to getting in contact with her.
[00:14:25.413 --> 00:14:30.575]  I've frankly been so busy making films and doing interviews that I've been playing phone tag with her people and I've only put in a few calls.
[00:14:30.996 --> 00:14:34.357]  Again, for some reason I just don't chase after these people.
[00:14:34.417 --> 00:14:37.439]  I should because it would have been big if we obviously got her on the air.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.720]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:42.701]  She's gone public.
[00:14:43.743 --> 00:14:51.566]  And I happen to know that she knows all about the New World Order and all about the left-right paradigm now and understands things and has broken her conditioning.
[00:14:52.887 --> 00:14:57.909]  She was always a loose cannon, but now you get a loose cannon who breaks their conditioning who is also very smart.
[00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.750]  People grow.
[00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.931]  People expand their horizons.
[00:15:04.392 --> 00:15:15.640]  I don't know if Barbra Streisand caressing the cheek of Hillary at a fundraiser a few nights ago will ever wake up, but we know her husband, James Brolin, has on that show about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:15:17.261 --> 00:15:18.461]  The mold is broken.
[00:15:18.482 --> 00:15:21.584]  Humpty Dumpty isn't going to be put back together again.
[00:15:23.805 --> 00:15:25.606]  They're probably going to attack Iran.
[00:15:26.007 --> 00:15:30.169]  They're probably going to nuke cities in this country.
[00:15:30.209 --> 00:15:32.371]  The CFR has been saying that for five years.
[00:15:33.248 --> 00:15:35.030]  They said we'd be attacked on 9-11.
[00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:36.552]  They laid that out.
[00:15:36.592 --> 00:15:38.294]  They're the think tank men behind it.
[00:15:39.535 --> 00:15:40.837]  Behind the North American Union.
[00:15:41.518 --> 00:15:42.639]  Behind the Iraq War.
[00:15:42.739 --> 00:15:43.840]  They set the policies.
[00:15:44.341 --> 00:15:45.342]  They set the standards.
[00:15:46.003 --> 00:15:48.626]  Their implementation plans are implemented.
[00:15:51.289 --> 00:15:51.990]  They run things.
[00:16:02.637 --> 00:16:04.738]  I got a guest about to walk into the studio.
[00:16:04.898 --> 00:16:06.719]  I'll see what happens with that.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.080]  Hey man, how you doing?
[00:16:09.781 --> 00:16:16.064]  Hey listen, the main office is right back there in the back and we're going to have you in here in studio in the next hour.
[00:16:16.764 --> 00:16:17.325]  Thanks a lot.
[00:16:19.666 --> 00:16:21.327]  There is no rhyme or reason anymore.
[00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.971]  So, as I was saying, if I can
[00:16:31.553 --> 00:16:33.074]  Go back to what I was covering.
[00:16:33.114 --> 00:16:33.974]  We're in bad shape.
[00:16:36.035 --> 00:16:46.361]  We've got ruthless individuals who enjoy risk and who've always basically won in the past, so they have a feeling of invincibility and bulletproof-ness.
[00:16:48.221 --> 00:16:54.925]  And Governor Richardson, big Bilderberg group member, big CFR, big Bohemian Grove member,
[00:16:56.388 --> 00:17:01.312]  Former Commerce Secretary, after they whacked Ron Brown, he's saying we're probably going to be nuked.
[00:17:02.552 --> 00:17:05.354]  That the war on terror will continue when he's President.
[00:17:06.475 --> 00:17:09.958]  If he's President, he's saying I'll continue the total Nazi agenda.
[00:17:11.019 --> 00:17:22.527]  And hell if he does, he's a Democrat and he's half Hispanic, so the guy could literally eat intestines of small children on the White House lawn or from the top of the Eiffel Tower and he'd be hailed as Jesus.
[00:17:24.036 --> 00:17:25.017]  The same thing with Hillary.
[00:17:25.157 --> 00:17:27.498]  And they're just going to double-team us with Richardson or Hillary.
[00:17:29.058 --> 00:17:30.439]  And just heaven help us, folks.
[00:17:30.719 --> 00:17:31.360]  Heaven help us.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.180]  It's going to be bad.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:38.643]  A lot of Democrats, you know, who woke up to Bush and his tyranny won't be able to see it for a year or two.
[00:17:40.064 --> 00:17:48.888]  Hillary will probably get elected, or Richardson will, and within six months of being elected, they'll probably set off an A-bomb and blow away half a city.
[00:17:50.405 --> 00:17:52.827]  There's going to be out and out worshipping of them on television.
[00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:53.928]  I mean, it's going to get bad.
[00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:01.094]  And if they do go with that, they'll probably whack me and about a thousand other people in a day out, just right out in the street, folks.
[00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:01.935]  They won't even play games.
[00:18:02.175 --> 00:18:03.897]  They'll just gun us down right out in the street.
[00:18:06.959 --> 00:18:14.686]  And then it won't be funny anymore, will it, to people on 9-11 Truth and all people that just jaw and flap their jaws and it's all a big social thing.
[00:18:15.667 --> 00:18:16.868]  It won't be funny anymore.
[00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:17.869]  Then it's going to get real.
[00:18:18.886 --> 00:18:33.752]  And then all the seeds that we planted, of all the people that didn't listen to us and laughed at us, the next big wave, the next big harvest, will be a bloody harvest for the New World Order, and it will be their downfall.
[00:18:34.232 --> 00:18:36.433]  If I have to make a guesstimation,
[00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:47.931]  The elite will go ahead and go through with everything and it's going to completely blow up in their face and then they're going to completely fall and this country will be a third world nation ever after.
[00:18:47.951 --> 00:18:54.494]  The EU is going to break up and split up and break up and the world is just going to fall back into
[00:18:56.078 --> 00:18:58.480]  Fall back into some semblance of freedom.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:05.726]  The evil will reorganize and try to put it all back together again, and we'll just keep rolling after that, but it's going to be a big setback for them.
[00:19:06.127 --> 00:19:13.233]  And then there'll be such an understanding of government-sponsored terror, and such a hatred of government, that I think you're going to see a new age of liberty dawning.
[00:19:14.477 --> 00:19:16.759]  Now, I know the churches tell you that's not the case.
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:32.533]  They desperately want you to have the self-fulfilling prophecy that you can't fight evil, that we can't have a reprieve as a civilization, that the end is this week, the end is next month, the end is next year, and that's just not the way history works, and that's also not my duty.
[00:19:33.388 --> 00:19:35.450]  My duty is to stand up against evil and corruption.
[00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.213]  All right, a Rosie Redonald report coming up.
[00:19:38.693 --> 00:19:41.896]  We will air the view today here on the show, the nine minute rant.
[00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:42.877]  Nobody has it yet.
[00:19:43.258 --> 00:19:43.758]  We've got it.
[00:19:43.818 --> 00:19:44.919]  We're trying to get it uploaded.
[00:19:47.182 --> 00:19:54.108]  And it's important to support us so we can have the crew to better bring you the materials we need to get to the public.
[00:19:54.128 --> 00:19:54.729]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.127 --> 00:20:05.728]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.

[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.221]  The Berkey Security Pack.

[00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:54.967]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:55.007 --> 00:20:56.170]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:02.285 --> 00:21:03.646]  Hi, Ted Anderson for Midas.
[00:21:03.706 --> 00:21:05.167]  It's March 28, 2007.
[00:21:05.627 --> 00:21:18.076]  Gold is at $6.67, and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $6.93, $3.47.62 for half ounce, and $1.73.81 for quarter ounce coins at $6.93, $3.47.62, and $1.73.81.
[00:21:19.437 --> 00:21:23.079]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[00:21:23.159 --> 00:21:26.181]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[00:21:26.281 --> 00:21:31.985]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document.
[00:21:32.405 --> 00:21:41.167]  Clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control, this will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[00:21:41.647 --> 00:21:43.947]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[00:21:44.007 --> 00:21:46.488]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[00:21:46.868 --> 00:21:50.188]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:51.829]  The U.S.
[00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:54.009]  GAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[00:21:54.049 --> 00:21:54.329]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.349 --> 00:21:54.529]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.658 --> 00:22:05.559]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:11.541]  Did you know that the United Nations' basic philosophy is both anti-American and pro-dictatorship?
[00:22:12.181 --> 00:22:21.504]  Did you know that the United Nations was founded by Communist and Marxist members of the Council on Foreign Relations, whose goal is a socialistic one-world government?
[00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:33.033]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:01.388 --> 00:23:03.451]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:04.071 --> 00:23:13.002]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:13.442 --> 00:23:20.651]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:26.845]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:38.935 --> 00:23:41.036]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:54.926]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:23:54.946 --> 00:23:57.448]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:16.178 --> 00:24:23.082]  Alright, this audio is a bit loud because this is Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:24:23.102 --> 00:24:30.807]  She's so busy she did her video blog there on YouTube while she's having her hair done.
[00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.392]  About to go on the VIEW TV show.
[00:24:33.452 --> 00:24:34.753]  And here she is yesterday.
[00:24:34.813 --> 00:24:37.094]  Now, we've talked to several people who did see the VIEW.
[00:24:37.114 --> 00:24:38.716]  We've got the tape here now.
[00:24:38.736 --> 00:24:41.798]  We're about to start uploading it so we can play it for you later.
[00:24:41.958 --> 00:24:43.399]  Totally went public on 9-11.
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.520]  False flag terror.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:51.526]  It all started when a caller called into the show bringing it up and she used that as her reason to spontaneously go public.
[00:24:52.587 --> 00:24:55.309]  Because again, she wasn't really planning to for the next few weeks.
[00:24:55.329 --> 00:25:00.173]  She was going to have a meeting with her family on an Easter vacation going to Florida.
[00:25:01.255 --> 00:25:03.516]  And she has just gone ahead and gone public.
[00:25:05.197 --> 00:25:10.079]  I know that I gave her Charlie Sheen's number yesterday because Charlie wanted to talk to her.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:15.302]  So who knows what went on last night, but I guess that would have been shot yesterday.
[00:25:15.962 --> 00:25:20.445]  Now here she is just making a mention of it on her video blog.
[00:25:20.485 --> 00:25:20.845]  Here it is.
[00:25:21.845 --> 00:25:25.107]  Okay Maria, the World Trade Center 7 was a controlled demolition.
[00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:35.773]  We were told the building was unstable and warned about the time of demolition so that the sound would not cause panic in BPC, Battery Park City.
[00:25:36.373 --> 00:25:37.593]  Well, that's very interesting.
[00:25:37.613 --> 00:25:41.494]  The thing about World Trade Center 7 is it was totally left out of the 9-11 Commission.
[00:25:43.115 --> 00:25:43.735]  That's weird.
[00:25:44.415 --> 00:25:47.756]  It's only the third time in history that fire has brought down a steel building.
[00:25:48.396 --> 00:25:50.557]  The other two times it happened was on the same day.
[00:25:51.217 --> 00:25:53.317]  World Trade Center 1 and World Trade Center 2.
[00:25:54.078 --> 00:25:55.198]  They both crumbled
[00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.170]  Alright.
[00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:57.650]  Okay.
[00:26:26.534 --> 00:26:36.902]  Now, today, nine minute rant on 9-11, and we've talked to two people now that have seen it, got the same report.
[00:26:37.702 --> 00:26:44.067]  Again, the DVR is here, and we're going to see if it was recorded.
[00:26:44.127 --> 00:26:50.452]  Murphy's Law won't work, but we'll see how that comes along.
[00:26:52.862 --> 00:26:56.143]  And we will get that up on air for you to actually hear what she said.
[00:26:56.163 --> 00:27:01.965]  And the reason this is important is, with it stated on a show that big, it's going to go absolutely supernova.
[00:27:03.086 --> 00:27:07.907]  I mean, ten times what you saw last week, and it was probably on twenty different TV programs or more.
[00:27:08.588 --> 00:27:17.671]  I mean, Inside Hollywood, Extra, five shows on Fox, three days in a row, hundreds of talk radio shows, CNN, Glenn Beck,
[00:27:18.964 --> 00:27:24.407]  I mean, I personally probably know of twenty-something TV shows.
[00:27:24.467 --> 00:27:26.848]  I've gotten a bunch of calls about other programs.
[00:27:28.209 --> 00:27:34.372]  I talked to some friends who were on vacation in Hawaii and saw local TV covering it in Hawaii last week.
[00:27:38.744 --> 00:27:40.265]  This will completely dwarf that.
[00:27:40.726 --> 00:27:52.852]  There's no way that they can give the orders for the media to shut this down, because the dominant mainstream television is controlled and steered and has government operatives throughout its strata.
[00:27:53.192 --> 00:27:53.773]  But they do not.
[00:27:53.813 --> 00:28:00.817]  But again, they dominate it by worldview, by hive mind, by intimidation, by political correctness.
[00:28:01.717 --> 00:28:04.999]  And with this coming out on The View with 30 million viewers,
[00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:07.689]  30 million every day.
[00:28:07.709 --> 00:28:08.552]  That's the average.
[00:28:10.216 --> 00:28:12.202]  It is going to explode.
[00:28:13.286 --> 00:28:15.046]  I mean, a nine-minute rant.
[00:28:15.347 --> 00:28:20.808]  We're not talking about a 30-second comment or a one-minute comment or a 10-second comment by James Brolin.
[00:28:21.288 --> 00:28:27.630]  We're talking about something that is going to resonate, that is going to explode.
[00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:40.653]  They are going to call for her firing, her crucifixion, and in that, it's going to draw it out into the public eye that the majority of Americans know they've been lied to, and a majority of that majority know that it's a total inside job.
[00:28:43.386 --> 00:28:46.327]  Stuff like this could stop the strike on Iran.
[00:28:47.767 --> 00:28:58.990]  Things like this will take Bush's approval rating that is between 30 and 25 percent, depending on which poll, and drop it down to more like 15 percent, like Dick Cheney's at 12 to 14, depending on which poll you look at.
[00:29:00.611 --> 00:29:05.692]  This is going to cause... We just had a whistleblower come out with the Building 7 diagrams, which no one seemed to post.
[00:29:05.732 --> 00:29:07.032]  I don't know why.
[00:29:07.332 --> 00:29:10.053]  Also, the Tower 1 and 2 diagrams came out and are out.
[00:29:10.942 --> 00:29:11.502]  Well, I know why.
[00:29:11.542 --> 00:29:13.483]  We don't have the personnel to cover all this.
[00:29:13.503 --> 00:29:14.344]  Do you understand, folks?
[00:29:15.144 --> 00:29:17.325]  This is like having five cops.
[00:29:17.446 --> 00:29:18.826]  It's like we're cops.
[00:29:19.146 --> 00:29:20.007]  That's basically what we are.
[00:29:21.328 --> 00:29:22.308]  We're the investigators.
[00:29:22.348 --> 00:29:23.489]  We're trying to stop the evil.
[00:29:23.849 --> 00:29:27.431]  And we have like 10 million murders to investigate with evidence just everywhere.
[00:29:28.012 --> 00:29:31.473]  It's like we have a thousand people trying to confess to crimes.
[00:29:31.693 --> 00:29:34.214]  We can't even deal with it all, okay?
[00:29:34.254 --> 00:29:35.455]  I mean, it's just piling up.
[00:29:35.795 --> 00:29:37.155]  Wall-to-wall insanity.
[00:29:37.536 --> 00:29:38.716]  Wall-to-wall evil.
[00:29:39.256 --> 00:29:41.437]  Just total craziness everywhere!
[00:29:45.399 --> 00:29:48.880]  And... My head is spinning.
[00:29:51.341 --> 00:29:52.321]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.741 --> 00:29:54.222]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.243 --> 00:29:57.986]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.449 --> 00:30:05.032]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:30:05.292 --> 00:30:06.153]  Look no further!
[00:30:06.453 --> 00:30:09.036]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:30:09.456 --> 00:30:17.884]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:30:18.104 --> 00:30:18.544]  We're good to go.
[00:30:35.649 --> 00:30:35.949]  I don't know.
[00:31:01.221 --> 00:31:07.900]  Thus says Yahweh, if you will not keep my commandments by violating my covenant, I will bring upon you sudden terror!
[00:31:11.753 --> 00:31:14.914]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[00:31:15.154 --> 00:31:18.835]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[00:31:19.115 --> 00:31:27.057]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.
[00:31:27.437 --> 00:31:30.198]  Get two Witness Ministries' next shocking revelation.
[00:31:30.458 --> 00:31:33.679]  The Rider of the White Horse, George W. Bush in Prophecy.
[00:31:34.039 --> 00:31:36.842]  Visit the website, twowitnessministries.com.
[00:31:37.122 --> 00:31:41.526]  King George II beats the war drums for his next invasion, Iran and Syria.
[00:31:41.866 --> 00:31:44.928]  More nations are to follow, including the draft of your children.
[00:31:45.209 --> 00:31:54.857]  With a $25 love offering to Two Witness Ministries, get the book, The Rider of the White Horse, at Box 2453, Abilene, Texas, 79604.
[00:31:55.237 --> 00:31:59.221]  Unless she repents, America will not survive the Red Horse of World War III.
[00:32:01.067 --> 00:32:01.667]  It's a fact.
[00:32:01.847 --> 00:32:06.290]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:11.812]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[00:32:12.092 --> 00:32:15.314]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[00:32:15.554 --> 00:32:22.697]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[00:32:23.037 --> 00:32:30.201]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[00:32:30.461 --> 00:32:32.562]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[00:32:32.963 --> 00:32:39.307]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[00:32:39.527 --> 00:32:43.330]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.252]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.
[00:32:46.292 --> 00:32:47.112]  to 5 p.m.
[00:32:47.172 --> 00:32:48.673]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[00:32:48.713 --> 00:32:49.093]  That's 920-293-8024.
[00:32:49.194 --> 00:32:50.154]  And ask for Robert.
[00:32:50.214 --> 00:32:53.176]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[00:33:02.482 --> 00:33:13.949]  I want to talk to people that saw the feud.
[00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:21.114]  It's hard to get relayed what was said in nine minutes, but I'm told it was extremely powerful.
[00:33:23.268 --> 00:33:29.009]  Paul Watson's already got a report out on it that will be growing as we're actually able to see it and it will be added to.
[00:33:29.589 --> 00:33:31.750]  Believe me, this is the chain reaction.
[00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:35.630]  This is the chain reaction.
[00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:37.471]  You're watching right now.
[00:33:38.371 --> 00:33:41.851]  We're not on there risking our lives for fun.
[00:33:43.032 --> 00:33:46.372]  We're doing this to bring down the New World Order.
[00:33:47.432 --> 00:33:49.833]  The churches have told you the New World Order can't be beat.
[00:33:49.913 --> 00:33:50.653]  They've lied to you.
[00:33:51.565 --> 00:33:53.086]  They've told you you can't fight evil.
[00:33:53.686 --> 00:33:56.207]  They've told you it's always going to win.
[00:33:57.407 --> 00:33:59.488]  It only wins when you do nothing.
[00:34:00.248 --> 00:34:02.509]  It only wins when you refuse to fight.
[00:34:03.369 --> 00:34:12.292]  If you will simply start slamming the New World Order upside the head, and banging their head in the concrete, and I mean that figuratively, in the info war.
[00:34:13.153 --> 00:34:16.614]  If you don't think about it, if you just engage them, and start stomping them,
[00:34:17.387 --> 00:34:27.789]  And start getting aggressive, and start burning copies of DVDs, and start calling in to talk radio, and start screaming on bullhorns, then we cannot be stopped.
[00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:34.171]  We are going to get these people, we are going to smoke them out of their holes, and we are going to take them to prison.
[00:34:35.011 --> 00:34:36.372]  They are going down.
[00:34:37.312 --> 00:34:42.733]  You understand, ladies and gentlemen, you have to first know that we are going to win!
[00:34:43.953 --> 00:34:46.774]  The North American Union is going to be defeated!
[00:34:47.381 --> 00:34:57.586]  The European Union expansion has already been shot down and now the bureaucrats are trying to ignore the will of the people in Europe and so that's only enraging them more.
[00:34:59.587 --> 00:35:04.109]  North American Union expansion was shot down in Latin America for the Pan American Union.
[00:35:06.218 --> 00:35:08.120]  The New World Order is in retreat everywhere.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:12.103]  That's why it's desperately trying to lunge into a massive escalation with Iran.
[00:35:12.603 --> 00:35:13.984]  That's all a con artist knows.
[00:35:14.244 --> 00:35:15.405]  That's all a bully knows.
[00:35:15.706 --> 00:35:20.549]  That's all a terrorist knows, is when they get caught, they try to grab hostages and put guns to their heads.
[00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:23.191]  And they try to up the ante, and they try to accelerate.
[00:35:25.013 --> 00:35:27.535]  I'm telling you, a new dawn of liberty is beginning.
[00:35:28.315 --> 00:35:35.221]  I'm telling you, a new age of resistance to tyranny is dawning against the New World Order.
[00:35:36.764 --> 00:35:41.167]  The New World Order is the Old World Order.
[00:35:41.787 --> 00:35:46.610]  Their counterfeit New Age is the Old Age, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:47.771 --> 00:35:50.572]  The tyranny is going to be defeated!
[00:35:52.313 --> 00:35:53.614]  Now some of us won't make it.
[00:35:53.974 --> 00:35:56.156]  And some of us will be arrested and some of us will be tortured.
[00:35:57.076 --> 00:36:00.098]  But I'm telling you right now, they can't get all of us.
[00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:03.921]  And you're in more danger not standing up and not getting involved.
[00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:04.561]  Now listen to me.
[00:36:05.382 --> 00:36:10.486]  Paul Watson's put a report up on PrisonPlanet.com about this Rosie O'Donnell situation.
[00:36:10.546 --> 00:36:15.049]  We need to get our report out first before the neocons put their spin on it.
[00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:16.770]  Okay?
[00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:19.592]  Rosie O'Donnell rant reaches 30 million.
[00:36:19.652 --> 00:36:28.858]  I want Paul to do a separate article that goes into the chain reaction, that goes into the domino effect, that I've been predicting and that we've been chronicling and watching.
[00:36:29.138 --> 00:36:31.220]  If you look at the graph, it's going straight up.
[00:36:32.441 --> 00:36:41.844]  It was ignited when I launched Operation Expose the Government Terrorist two months before 9-11 saying they would probably use their asset Bin Laden to take the blame for an attack on the World Trade Centers.
[00:36:42.464 --> 00:36:47.965]  I should call the White House and tell them do not stage terror attacks in New York to launch a war.
[00:36:48.805 --> 00:36:53.146]  Because I saw enough preparatory propaganda to be able to deduce that.
[00:36:53.226 --> 00:36:54.387]  Now that's on record!
[00:36:55.187 --> 00:36:58.808]  And I'm telling you right now that was the ignition point.
[00:37:01.041 --> 00:37:03.243]  We're going to go to Adam Locke in just a moment, but I've got to finish this thought.
[00:37:04.364 --> 00:37:08.647]  Then, from that point, we jumped to 9-11 with the attacks.
[00:37:08.747 --> 00:37:10.468]  Day one, I hit the ground running.
[00:37:11.089 --> 00:37:13.070]  I was attacked by a talk show host on my own.
[00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:14.771]  Network is going too far.
[00:37:15.332 --> 00:37:18.935]  I had people that I knew personally walk up to me at the TV station and cuss at me.
[00:37:20.035 --> 00:37:23.738]  But I knew they staged the attacks, and I knew they'd staged attacks before.
[00:37:23.838 --> 00:37:25.600]  And I knew about Operation Northwoods.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.743]  And I'd seen all the propaganda preparing us, as many of you saw.
[00:37:31.738 --> 00:37:34.079]  And so we founded 9-11 Truth.
[00:37:34.119 --> 00:37:38.841]  We founded the resistance to the New World Order's greatest push.
[00:37:39.281 --> 00:37:47.624]  Their desperation move to sure up their faltering world government that was still in its adolescent phases.
[00:37:49.065 --> 00:37:55.127]  I would say going out of toddler into adolescent.
[00:37:55.807 --> 00:37:57.288]  It was in that in-between area.
[00:37:59.033 --> 00:38:06.514]  And now it's growing into young manhood, but it's deformed.
[00:38:06.594 --> 00:38:07.395]  It's insane.
[00:38:07.875 --> 00:38:08.835]  It's falling apart.
[00:38:08.915 --> 00:38:15.916]  Oh, it will rise to its penultimate goal only as the very foundations beneath it crumble.
[00:38:17.977 --> 00:38:19.657]  You understand that, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:38:22.097 --> 00:38:25.218]  It's like if you had a set of blocks building a big structure.
[00:38:25.842 --> 00:38:27.464]  As you've done, many of you, with your children.
[00:38:27.504 --> 00:38:33.389]  When you put that last block up there, it only stands for a second and then it leans and falls.
[00:38:36.532 --> 00:38:37.613]  We don't have a choice.
[00:38:37.673 --> 00:38:39.074]  We've got to fight these people.
[00:38:40.035 --> 00:38:47.262]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com and get the Rosie O'Donnell story and get it to the four wins now.
[00:38:47.662 --> 00:38:50.645]  Get it out to every website, every blog, every message board.
[00:38:53.683 --> 00:39:14.300]  There's an incredible story today that I meant to get to, where a major British newspaper, probably the biggest technology paper, daily paper in the world, the Registore, attacks me, attacks PrisonPlanet.com, and says we're delusional that Big Brother attacks our websites.
[00:39:15.382 --> 00:39:20.447]  Google admits that they have reset our views on TerrorStorm to get us out of the top 100.
[00:39:21.447 --> 00:39:34.359]  Digg has publicly banned us four months ago and has now permanently banned us from ever being able to enter the top stories no matter if we get a thousand digs when a story with 50 digs goes to the main page.
[00:39:36.545 --> 00:39:45.888]  They publicly, their moderators publicly go on the message board and laugh about how they're banning us and how they're going to kill 9-11 truthers when they take over.
[00:39:46.988 --> 00:39:47.308]  Okay?
[00:39:47.668 --> 00:39:54.550]  That CENTCOM publicly admits that they're online blogging and putting out neocon propaganda.
[00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:57.991]  Billions in fake news has been purchased.
[00:40:00.197 --> 00:40:08.867]  We've had hackers go in and post pornography on the front page of the site before and we have it where it triggered and took the site down as a naked woman on a motorcycle.
[00:40:09.148 --> 00:40:12.492]  The point is to claim that we haven't had denial of service attacks.
[00:40:13.353 --> 00:40:20.261]  To claim that there haven't been attacks on our sites and call us delusional when it is admitted
[00:40:20.842 --> 00:40:21.743]  That they've done this.
[00:40:22.083 --> 00:40:24.664]  When it is admitted that they've restricted us.
[00:40:25.005 --> 00:40:29.187]  When it is admitted that they have done this to us and others is disgusting.
[00:40:29.387 --> 00:40:36.072]  And there's another story out, again I never got to yesterday, saying we're delusional, there's no North American Union.
[00:40:36.112 --> 00:40:37.533]  The thing's like ten pages long.
[00:40:37.773 --> 00:40:42.676]  I could analyze it for three hours and show you the mindset of these people.
[00:40:44.801 --> 00:40:46.502]  Now for about five minutes, I appreciate him holding.
[00:40:46.542 --> 00:40:50.763]  I want to bring Adam Lockup because he was scheduled to come on today and I appreciate him joining us.
[00:40:52.504 --> 00:40:57.206]  And that concerns British Birkfeld water filters, which they're the national distributor of.
[00:40:57.226 --> 00:41:07.730]  And they have the Made in America Big Berkey with the black berkey elements, which was looked at by two major universities and found to take it to a new level.
[00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:12.772]  And I still have a British Berkey I bought eight years ago in operation.
[00:41:13.733 --> 00:41:17.076]  And I have a black Berkey here in the office, American Berkey.
[00:41:18.117 --> 00:41:22.602]  And I have given more than 10 of these over the years to people.
[00:41:29.928 --> 00:41:34.293]  So, Adam, it's good to have you on with us.
[00:41:34.333 --> 00:41:34.633]  Are you there?
[00:41:35.615 --> 00:41:36.095]  Yes, sir!
[00:41:36.515 --> 00:41:37.636]  Alex, thank you once again.
[00:41:37.876 --> 00:41:39.176]  Always a pleasure to be a part of your show.
[00:41:39.316 --> 00:41:40.196]  Thanks for coming on.
[00:41:40.896 --> 00:41:42.057]  People can trust the government.
[00:41:42.097 --> 00:41:43.157]  They can just drink the water.
[00:41:43.357 --> 00:41:44.557]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:41:48.378 --> 00:41:49.719]  Very interesting you bring that up.
[00:41:51.259 --> 00:42:01.482]  Just this past month, they're talking over in Ireland about how if the Green Party is elected, they are going to pull fluoride out of the water because they say, of course, it's no good.
[00:42:02.002 --> 00:42:04.563]  Yet an inside group
[00:42:05.734 --> 00:42:07.336]  Well, you know, it's in mainstream history books.
[00:42:07.376 --> 00:42:08.197]  I mean, award-winning.
[00:42:28.227 --> 00:42:32.670]  There was a Pulitzer Prize winning World War II book, and every time I want to remember the name it doesn't come to me.
[00:42:33.191 --> 00:42:52.905]  I read it online like ten years ago and I believed it, but then I actually saw the book on my parents' bookshelf, pulled it, went to the bibliography under fluoride, looked at it, and it talked about, I mean here was a Pulitzer Prize winning book, you can look it up online folks, and showing the Nazi documents, how they put it in the water to sedate the people.
[00:42:53.605 --> 00:42:57.408]  And you tell the public this, some of them still laugh, but here's the good news, three or four years ago,
[00:42:58.337 --> 00:43:02.881]  I'd have to go to Whole Foods or to a specialty shop to find fluoride-free toothpaste.
[00:43:02.961 --> 00:43:04.362]  Now Walgreens has it.
[00:43:04.802 --> 00:43:07.024]  Now Oral-B's putting it out.
[00:43:07.144 --> 00:43:08.545]  Now the grocery store has it.
[00:43:08.825 --> 00:43:14.089]  And now it's starting to take more and more shelf space, pushing the fluoride toothpaste away.
[00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:15.210]  So what's the government do?
[00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:17.252]  Oh, we're going to now spray it on your crops.
[00:43:18.133 --> 00:43:19.774]  I mean, it's just hell on earth, man.
[00:43:19.874 --> 00:43:20.995]  Hell on earth.
[00:43:23.112 --> 00:43:25.733]  Well, some communities are standing up to it, Alex.
[00:43:26.493 --> 00:43:32.135]  Back in December, Juneau, Alaska, Martin County, Florida, both voted fluoride out of their drinking water.
[00:43:32.875 --> 00:43:34.876]  The same thing is going on in Tennessee.
[00:43:35.336 --> 00:43:37.557]  Legislators are urging people to stop fluoridation.
[00:43:37.917 --> 00:43:43.979]  Vermont Department of Health last year sent a fluoridation warning to all of Vermont dentists and pediatricians.
[00:43:44.639 --> 00:43:46.700]  Now, why would they do that if fluoride is good for you?
[00:43:49.156 --> 00:43:55.504]  Well, that's because in the levels people are getting sodium and stannous fluoride and even calcium fluoride, it's very deadly.
[00:43:55.544 --> 00:43:56.766]  It causes bone fractures.
[00:43:56.826 --> 00:44:00.451]  It causes calcification of the teeth, those yellow spots.
[00:44:01.272 --> 00:44:14.720]  It causes all sorts of problems in the endocrine system, attacks the pituitary and hypothalamus glands, and retards brain development in the shoulder, and that's why the globalists push it, and fluoridated drinking water for your children!
[00:44:15.301 --> 00:44:17.442]  And you see it fluoridated for kids!
[00:44:17.502 --> 00:44:19.183]  It's so sick!
[00:44:19.563 --> 00:44:25.267]  But the public, again, cannot realize that it's a huge eugenics program against the public.
[00:44:26.776 --> 00:44:32.642]  Well, the other thing that's coming up interesting in the news this last week, Alex, is arsenic has popped up several times.
[00:44:33.323 --> 00:44:36.646]  There's a new research coming out showing arsenic tainted drinking water
[00:44:37.239 --> 00:44:38.780]  You know what, I think you're an extremist.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:45.703]  Herbicides, pesticides, mercury, arsenic, the thousands of MBTE, massive carcinogens in 49 states, in all the major water tables.
[00:45:02.711 --> 00:45:03.291]  You're bad.
[00:45:03.431 --> 00:45:03.892]  It's good.
[00:45:03.972 --> 00:45:04.792]  It's there to help us.
[00:45:04.952 --> 00:45:05.612]  I'm going to drink it.
[00:45:05.992 --> 00:45:15.136]  And I love living, you know, in the South with the Colorado River that has been through all these states and all these cities, all the heavy metals, all the poisons, all the Prozac, all the Ritalin.
[00:45:15.716 --> 00:45:16.457]  I'm going to drink it.
[00:45:16.637 --> 00:45:17.837]  I'm going to give it to my children.
[00:45:18.177 --> 00:45:19.858]  Shut up, Adam Locke.
[00:45:20.018 --> 00:45:20.518]  It's good.
[00:45:20.638 --> 00:45:21.479]  You're with Al Qaeda.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.140]  I'm just reporting what's in the news, Alex.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.841]  I mean, this stuff is out for public use only.
[00:45:28.021 --> 00:45:28.661]  No, no, no.
[00:45:28.721 --> 00:45:29.822]  You should trust your government.
[00:45:33.096 --> 00:45:33.436]  Okay.
[00:45:33.817 --> 00:45:34.778]  Let's go to Oregon.
[00:45:35.039 --> 00:45:35.599]  Same deal.
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:38.003]  Arsenic popping up in wells in Sweet Home.
[00:45:38.063 --> 00:45:44.513]  Nearly a quarter of the local wells tested through a free program are showing higher levels of arsenic than is recommended.
[00:45:45.417 --> 00:45:46.538]  As far as the safety standard.
[00:45:46.918 --> 00:45:52.861]  Also, turning up in there, the presence of E. coli in 25 of these wells indicates... That's good for you, too.
[00:45:52.961 --> 00:45:53.622]  It's good for you.
[00:45:53.702 --> 00:45:56.703]  Listen, I have a newscast, Adam, that says mercury is good for your brain.
[00:45:56.984 --> 00:45:57.624]  In fact, get it.
[00:45:57.704 --> 00:45:58.464]  I'm going to air it again.
[00:45:58.704 --> 00:46:00.806]  This aired all over the country in local versions.
[00:46:01.166 --> 00:46:02.427]  Total government propaganda.
[00:46:03.027 --> 00:46:04.948]  Do you have that, where the mercury is nutritious?
[00:46:06.399 --> 00:46:09.681]  No, I mean I was telling the network to grab the clip.
[00:46:10.781 --> 00:46:11.801]  John does an incredible job.
[00:46:11.821 --> 00:46:14.222]  There's like thousands of clips and he's able to pull them.
[00:46:14.242 --> 00:46:16.043]  Do you have the Mercury Nutritious clip, please?
[00:46:17.063 --> 00:46:18.044]  He's finding it.
[00:46:18.244 --> 00:46:19.104]  No, I'm not kidding, Adam.
[00:46:19.124 --> 00:46:21.145]  Did you know they now advertise that Mercury is good for your children?
[00:46:23.617 --> 00:46:24.197]  No, I did not.
[00:46:24.538 --> 00:46:28.759]  It is the most deadly heavy metal other than like DU that they know of.
[00:46:29.179 --> 00:46:36.662]  It's non-radioactive because other heavy metals just create plaques and kill brain cells, but mercury, I've seen under an electron microscope, read studies about it.
[00:46:37.483 --> 00:46:38.903]  Big University of Montreal did one.
[00:46:39.343 --> 00:46:46.626]  When mercury gets up against a neuron, it causes an electrochemical explosion and it just starts frying and it's like acid burns through the brain.
[00:46:46.946 --> 00:46:49.047]  It's the heavy metal gift that keeps on giving.
[00:46:50.808 --> 00:46:51.268]  Good stuff.
[00:46:53.803 --> 00:46:58.091]  Give them the number and tell them about a few of the specials and the sports burkeys and what they get when they call.
[00:46:59.822 --> 00:47:00.663]  Alright.
[00:47:00.863 --> 00:47:04.645]  The number, of course, is 888-803-4438.
[00:47:05.226 --> 00:47:10.309]  And it's interesting we've been talking about fluoride and arsenic because we do have something specifically designed for that.
[00:47:10.729 --> 00:47:13.991]  It's a post-filtration element called the PF2.
[00:47:14.451 --> 00:47:22.335]  It attaches to the bottom of your purification element and it will reduce or remove arsenic and or fluoride.
[00:47:22.796 --> 00:47:24.877]  Well, it's just the and fluoride, not or.
[00:47:26.673 --> 00:47:27.853]  Debbie knows all about these things.
[00:47:28.253 --> 00:47:31.034]  Again, 888-803-4438.
[00:47:31.774 --> 00:47:36.455]  Make sure if you call her to do tell her that she heard about this on Alex Jones' show.
[00:47:37.036 --> 00:47:40.096]  And that's not just a gimmick for the advertising folks.
[00:47:40.756 --> 00:47:43.497]  That's how you get the discount on top of the discount by ordering.
[00:47:43.977 --> 00:47:48.238]  Either if it's the British model, they're the national distributors, so you get it at wholesale price.
[00:47:48.318 --> 00:47:49.239]  We're just ordering wine.
[00:47:49.859 --> 00:47:53.560]  If it's the American model, which we now buy because we've read the studies, it's even better.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.680]  The British is excellent, by the way.
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.062]  I mean, you can't go wrong with either one.
[00:47:57.582 --> 00:48:04.047]  When you buy the American made by New Millennium Concepts or their sports bottles, those are excellent.
[00:48:04.107 --> 00:48:05.428]  It's all very good.
[00:48:05.488 --> 00:48:12.533]  And then you get an even bigger discount and the free sports bottle gift or the potassium iodate or the shelter-in-place DVD when you get the fancy
[00:48:13.704 --> 00:48:17.905]  Berkey Light with the lights and they've got little solar panel systems.
[00:48:18.485 --> 00:48:23.487]  The system is gravity fed, but the solar panel system is good to plug in to run the LED lights or charge cell phones.
[00:48:23.687 --> 00:48:25.307]  They've got a lot of neat stuff to the point.
[00:48:25.327 --> 00:48:34.249]  888-803-4438, 888-803-4438 or berkeywater.com and tell them in the comment section which free gift you want.
[00:48:34.569 --> 00:48:35.870]  Adam, of course, you know I'm joking.
[00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:36.810]  You do a great job.
[00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:41.456]  And you're wonderful, and we're all evil here because we say that you shouldn't trust the government.
[00:48:41.476 --> 00:48:46.882]  You should go to the EPA's own website and read the thousands of things that are in the water at allowable levels.
[00:48:48.304 --> 00:48:51.789]  It adds up in the aggregate to be a toxic, toxic soup.
[00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:55.133]  And a lot of it's by design, some of it isn't.
[00:48:55.513 --> 00:49:03.424]  But from the motor oil to the dead bacteria to the chlorine and the arsenic and the MBTE, you can't go wrong getting a water filter.
[00:49:03.784 --> 00:49:09.672]  And the Brita systems and the charcoal things, you know, they cut out some of the bad taste, but they don't cut out all the bad stuff.
[00:49:09.732 --> 00:49:10.073]  Right, Adam?
[00:49:10.894 --> 00:49:11.314]  Absolutely.
[00:49:11.354 --> 00:49:13.154]  Thanks for joining us, Adam.
[00:49:35.602 --> 00:49:36.062]  Our pleasure.
[00:49:36.082 --> 00:49:36.582]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:49:36.802 --> 00:49:37.282]  Take care.
[00:49:37.302 --> 00:49:39.883]  888-803-4438.
[00:49:40.023 --> 00:49:40.923]  Okay.
[00:49:42.324 --> 00:49:43.584]  That's part of preparedness, too.
[00:49:43.604 --> 00:49:45.384]  I mean, you really should get storable foods, folks.
[00:49:46.285 --> 00:49:46.965]  They don't have those.
[00:49:47.005 --> 00:49:48.105]  I'm just telling you, you should.
[00:49:48.865 --> 00:49:50.926]  You really should have some gold, some firearms.
[00:49:50.966 --> 00:49:52.386]  You should know how to use those firearms.
[00:49:52.886 --> 00:49:58.968]  You should be ready and willing to use those firearms to defend your family from, I mean, looting, hordes, or whatever.
[00:49:58.988 --> 00:50:01.148]  I mean, it just comes down to that.
[00:50:02.508 --> 00:50:03.749]  It's just good to be prepared.
[00:50:03.809 --> 00:50:04.889]  It's good to be independent.
[00:50:05.658 --> 00:50:07.799]  It's good to be able to skin a buck and run a trot line.
[00:50:09.079 --> 00:50:11.640]  You know, we raise our own tomatoes and our own smoke too.
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.721]  There isn't too many things these old boys can't do.
[00:50:14.481 --> 00:50:19.443]  We need to get back to that point so we're not a bunch of chicken necks who are completely dependent.
[00:50:20.484 --> 00:50:22.945]  And I don't have time to have a big garden.
[00:50:22.985 --> 00:50:23.605]  I do have a garden.
[00:50:23.625 --> 00:50:26.066]  I don't have time to live out in the country because I have to fight here in the city.
[00:50:26.486 --> 00:50:27.906]  But if I had my druthers, I would.
[00:50:27.926 --> 00:50:29.907]  And I'd have a big garden.
[00:50:30.347 --> 00:50:32.708]  We do have family that has a big garden and we do have a place to go.
[00:50:33.428 --> 00:50:34.749]  And I mean acres of garden.
[00:50:35.632 --> 00:50:36.693]  We do canned stuff.
[00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:37.994]  I mean, it's simple.
[00:50:38.634 --> 00:50:39.495]  It has to be done.
[00:50:39.755 --> 00:50:41.136]  You've got to have a support system.
[00:50:42.297 --> 00:50:44.459]  And filters are number one.
[00:50:44.539 --> 00:50:47.081]  Water, you'll die within three days in most cases.
[00:50:48.041 --> 00:50:49.362]  Three to four days without water.
[00:50:49.382 --> 00:50:53.105]  Of course, Terry Chaveau went 15 days.
[00:50:54.126 --> 00:50:54.766]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:04.182 --> 00:51:09.648]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.009 --> 00:51:17.637]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.351 --> 00:51:25.393]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.793 --> 00:51:37.215]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.536 --> 00:51:41.156]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.476 --> 00:51:43.417]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.757 --> 00:51:47.598]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:00.723 --> 00:52:05.807]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:52:05.867 --> 00:52:13.192]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:52:13.332 --> 00:52:23.960]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:28.723]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:52:28.983 --> 00:52:33.984]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:37.125]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:37.365 --> 00:52:47.207]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[00:53:38.046 --> 00:53:38.686]  We're good to go.
[00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:15.912]  Mike Nelson works in my office, his mother.
[00:54:39.005 --> 00:54:43.527]  I saw the view piece this morning.
[00:54:43.567 --> 00:54:46.609]  Of course, we have the DVR here, Murphy's Law, as I predicted.
[00:54:46.629 --> 00:54:48.630]  It crashed and doesn't work.
[00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:51.591]  Nothing works in this society of junk and trash.
[00:54:52.572 --> 00:54:56.674]  And we just don't have the personnel or the funds to sit here and just tape all the TV and have the things.
[00:54:57.034 --> 00:55:06.299]  If you want us to be able to do that, just buy my films, buy my books, buy my videos, buy the stuff we sell, and then we'll have the money to hire the people to do a proper job up here.
[00:55:07.239 --> 00:55:09.501]  I mean, and I'm not beating the audience up.
[00:55:09.561 --> 00:55:10.442]  I love you to death.
[00:55:10.462 --> 00:55:12.583]  It's just, I want to do more against these people.
[00:55:12.784 --> 00:55:13.965]  And I want to be more effective.
[00:55:15.005 --> 00:55:15.306]  Okay?
[00:55:15.566 --> 00:55:16.386]  Sherry saw it.
[00:55:17.287 --> 00:55:18.448]  Sherry Nelson.
[00:55:18.768 --> 00:55:20.310]  Sherry, thank you for coming on.
[00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:21.631]  I appreciate you joining us.
[00:55:22.411 --> 00:55:25.794]  Tell me about what you saw, basically, with Rosie O'Donnell this morning on The View.
[00:55:26.875 --> 00:55:32.299]  Well, she kind of was going off on Elizabeth again, which she's done kind of routinely about things.
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:33.641]  She's really on a
[00:55:34.679 --> 00:55:38.422]  Kick that seems that she would like to get a movement started to impeach Bush.
[00:55:39.363 --> 00:55:42.045]  And Elizabeth of course is the reverse of that.
[00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:50.072]  But this morning she got talking about Building 7, which I thought was a little strange that she would come out with that.
[00:55:50.552 --> 00:55:51.353]  How did that start?
[00:55:51.433 --> 00:55:52.554]  It started with a caller, right?
[00:55:53.915 --> 00:55:54.335]  With a what?
[00:55:55.336 --> 00:55:57.218]  Didn't it start with a caller to the show?
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.981]  No, I don't think they had any call-in this morning.
[00:56:00.061 --> 00:56:01.743]  Okay, so that's what I was told here at the office.
[00:56:01.803 --> 00:56:03.344]  Okay, well just tell me what you saw.
[00:56:03.524 --> 00:56:04.585]  I didn't think that they had a call-in.
[00:56:04.625 --> 00:56:05.566]  Let's just not worry about it.
[00:56:05.966 --> 00:56:06.827]  Let's just not worry about it.
[00:56:06.847 --> 00:56:07.767]  Just tell me what you saw.
[00:56:08.428 --> 00:56:21.197]  Well, I don't know how they got started on it, but anyway, she got talking about Building 7, and she was trying to tell Elizabeth that there was no fire that could bring steel down like that, that that was an inside job with an implosion.
[00:56:22.558 --> 00:56:23.139]  And Elizabeth
[00:56:23.612 --> 00:56:29.493]  I was struggling with the belief on that, but what Rosie got to was... So Rosie said the words that it was an inside job?
[00:56:30.413 --> 00:56:37.315]  No, I really don't remember, Alex, exactly what she said verbatim on there, but she did say, you know, bringing it down with an implosion inside, I think.
[00:56:38.275 --> 00:56:52.098]  Anyway, Elizabeth said she would keep her mind open to that, but what they were going to do was they were going to call in a Yale or a Harvard expert with physics so that they could explain how that couldn't just happen that way with the building.
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:58.326]  And I think Joy brought up the fact that Yale was Bush's alum or alma mater.
[00:56:58.747 --> 00:57:01.690]  And Rosie said, OK, we'll go with a Harvard expert then.
[00:57:02.411 --> 00:57:07.618]  And Elizabeth said if they would bring in an expert like that, that she would keep her mind open if they could prove to her.
[00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:13.673]  Well, why don't they have Kevin Ryan on from Underwriting Laboratories and Engineer?
[00:57:14.193 --> 00:57:15.594]  Why don't they bring the blueprints on?
[00:57:15.634 --> 00:57:16.555]  I mean, it's simple.
[00:57:16.575 --> 00:57:18.356]  They could have Steven Jones, a physicist, on.
[00:57:18.636 --> 00:57:21.198]  There's so many they could have on the show.
[00:57:21.599 --> 00:57:26.202]  Now, I'm told she also talked about false flag terrorism and Gulf of Tonkin?
[00:57:28.764 --> 00:57:32.487]  I didn't see all of it, I guess, because I didn't catch that one there.
[00:57:33.467 --> 00:57:34.308]  When did you tune in?
[00:57:35.974 --> 00:57:40.716]  Well, I had it on, but I was in and out of the room, so I didn't hear, you know, kind of the whole... I understand.
[00:57:40.736 --> 00:57:41.657]  ...the whole thing of it.
[00:57:41.677 --> 00:57:41.837]  Okay.
[00:57:41.857 --> 00:57:47.039]  Well, that... Well, still, that's a help, though, as we try to, uh, try to confirm exactly what was said there.
[00:57:47.159 --> 00:57:49.200]  Uh, listen, I really appreciate you spending time with us.
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:50.400]  Okay.
[00:57:50.781 --> 00:57:51.261]  God bless.
[00:57:51.941 --> 00:57:52.441]  Okay.
[00:57:52.742 --> 00:58:01.125]  Um... Yeah, I've talked to, uh, two other people, separate from her, who did see it, and now the computer's working.
[00:58:02.426 --> 00:58:05.047]  A Chinese, um, piece of junk.
[00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:07.350]  Chinese made piece of junk.
[00:58:11.572 --> 00:58:14.272]  Basically folks, I just want at them.
[00:58:14.292 --> 00:58:15.153]  Can you pick up on that?
[00:58:15.973 --> 00:58:17.373]  It's more of a controlled rage now.
[00:58:17.413 --> 00:58:18.134]  That's my life.
[00:58:18.874 --> 00:58:20.074]  I just want at these people.
[00:58:20.594 --> 00:58:21.795]  I know we can beat them.
[00:58:22.855 --> 00:58:23.815]  I smell blood.
[00:58:24.815 --> 00:58:32.258]  And nothing on earth is going to stop me from getting my hands around their figurative neck.
[00:58:32.698 --> 00:58:33.358]  Now join me.
[00:58:34.142 --> 00:58:38.123]  Let's come in with a big win against the New World Order!
[00:58:41.163 --> 00:58:46.224]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.264 --> 00:58:46.604]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.624 --> 00:58:47.104]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.304 --> 00:58:47.784]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:47.804 --> 00:58:48.284]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.957 --> 00:59:04.857]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.498 --> 00:59:09.500]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:13.802]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:27.501]  It is a literal war room.
[00:59:27.581 --> 00:59:31.984]  We have too many targets to even be able to focus in on any one of them.
[00:59:32.085 --> 00:59:33.846]  It's just insanity all over the map.
[00:59:34.546 --> 00:59:37.128]  We do have the first nine minutes of the view today.
[00:59:37.208 --> 00:59:40.590]  Rosie O'Donnell did a detailed rant on 9-11.
[00:59:40.951 --> 00:59:42.832]  This is going to go ultra supernova.
[00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:48.213]  This is going to cause an even bigger chain reaction and a mass awakening to 9-11.
[00:59:49.193 --> 00:59:52.374]  Millions and millions and millions of seeds.
[00:59:52.514 --> 00:59:58.317]  I would say billions because tens of millions of people have planted hundreds if not thousands of seeds apiece.
[00:59:59.008 --> 01:00:01.971]  And so you've got hundreds of seeds per person.
[01:00:02.692 --> 01:00:09.459]  Every person out there, everybody I've talked to has heard about 9-11 truth, has heard it's an inside job, has heard some of the reasons.
[01:00:09.519 --> 01:00:13.163]  Whether they believe it or not, in their gut they know the truth.
[01:00:13.483 --> 01:00:16.987]  And polls show 84% know that they're being lied to about 9-11.
[01:00:17.227 --> 01:00:20.591]  Angus and Reed for the Wall Street Journal and ABC News.
[01:00:21.809 --> 01:00:27.733]  Then we have the Ohio, Scripps Howard, Ohio Scientific Study, 36% and that was from early last year.
[01:00:28.254 --> 01:00:30.375]  That was many months before the 84 number came out.
[01:00:30.415 --> 01:00:31.616]  It's growing in all the trends.
[01:00:32.657 --> 01:00:40.843]  Showing 36% would tell a telephone poller that they believe it's a total inside job, but 68% believing a total cover-up and a lie.
[01:00:42.104 --> 01:00:45.747]  And you dovetail that now with all the new trends coming out.
[01:00:45.867 --> 01:00:48.309]  Every CNN poll, every MSNBC poll,
[01:00:49.103 --> 01:00:51.812]  Every other poll they've had, guess what it shows?
[01:00:51.832 --> 01:00:52.795]  83 to 85.
[01:00:52.835 --> 01:00:53.176]  That number.
[01:00:56.428 --> 01:00:57.589]  Those numbers keep coming up.
[01:00:58.169 --> 01:00:57.589]  83, 84, 85.
[01:00:58.690 --> 01:00:59.990]  Right in there.
[01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:02.652]  Over, and over, and over, and over, and over.
[01:01:03.132 --> 01:01:04.433]  And that's what focus groups do.
[01:01:04.693 --> 01:01:07.915]  Not just getting people in a room and asking what their opinion is randomly off the street.
[01:01:08.336 --> 01:01:16.100]  They add with the focus group data, indexed polls, averaging sometimes 10, 20, 30, 40 polls together.
[01:01:16.221 --> 01:01:19.883]  That's how you get a really good number with that mass sampling.
[01:01:20.383 --> 01:01:24.766]  Let me tell you, New World Order, we are kicking your hind end.
[01:01:25.942 --> 01:01:27.303]  And all the glory goes to God.
[01:01:27.683 --> 01:01:31.446]  We are not going to stop exposing you, you murdering trash.
[01:01:32.406 --> 01:01:39.050]  And if God wants to use people like Rosie O'Donnell and Charlie Sheen, again, God works in mysterious ways.
[01:01:39.371 --> 01:01:41.352]  And these people have got guts.
[01:01:41.512 --> 01:01:47.256]  Charlie Sheen is a really intelligent person, a good person, I know him very well, and a real gentleman and I'm honored to know him.
[01:01:47.276 --> 01:01:49.097]  Most of the stuff you hear about him is lies.
[01:01:50.553 --> 01:01:56.799]  I'll tell you, Rosie O'Donnell is silly and she's ignorant, but she's got guts and guts is enough to steal the full metal jacket line.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.302]  She's come a long way, folks, and I know people that know her well.
[01:02:00.602 --> 01:02:04.486]  She knows about the New World Order now, and she's freaked out, and her paradigm has shifted.
[01:02:05.127 --> 01:02:08.670]  She's got a lot of courage to go on there and did what she did.
[01:02:11.966 --> 01:02:16.148]  Here I go from boycotting her seven, eight years ago, and she lost her job, folks.
[01:02:16.168 --> 01:02:18.568]  I hope she never finds out about that.
[01:02:20.929 --> 01:02:22.370]  The world is so weird, man.
[01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:23.550]  It is so weird.
[01:02:25.991 --> 01:02:27.112]  It is so weird.
[01:02:30.773 --> 01:02:35.675]  She lost that TV show, but she went up against the gun community, and she got spanked, and she learned to shut up about that.
[01:02:37.936 --> 01:02:38.896]  But she's not into that anymore.
[01:02:38.936 --> 01:02:41.197]  I've asked people that know her that are personal friends with her.
[01:02:42.538 --> 01:02:43.699]  And does she know about what we do?
[01:02:43.719 --> 01:02:44.579]  Does she know about our work?
[01:02:44.619 --> 01:02:44.899]  Yes.
[01:02:44.959 --> 01:02:45.820]  Has she seen the film?
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:46.140]  Yes.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.261]  Does she know about the New World Order now?
[01:02:47.301 --> 01:02:47.601]  Yes.
[01:02:48.661 --> 01:02:56.285]  I mean, my God, Rosie O'Donnell watches my YouTube clips, John Connor's, she said she has, and she's fans of John Connor.
[01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:58.266]  The guy is a Christian conservative.
[01:02:58.547 --> 01:03:02.809]  See, what's happened, and all his clips say that, what changed her?
[01:03:04.025 --> 01:03:05.286]  Believe me, I can look into her eyes.
[01:03:05.346 --> 01:03:05.966]  I can watch her.
[01:03:06.006 --> 01:03:06.767]  I've analyzed her.
[01:03:07.047 --> 01:03:07.667]  I've assessed her.
[01:03:07.928 --> 01:03:09.168]  That woman is for real.
[01:03:09.569 --> 01:03:11.310]  She believes the things she's saying.
[01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:12.751]  This is not some setup.
[01:03:14.032 --> 01:03:17.234]  It is going to, as I told you two weeks ago, I said, we've got to make this break.
[01:03:17.254 --> 01:03:17.994]  We've got to make it break.
[01:03:18.174 --> 01:03:19.775]  She's tentatively gone public.
[01:03:19.975 --> 01:03:21.196]  We've got to push it out in the open.
[01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:22.917]  It got pushed out in the open last week.
[01:03:23.218 --> 01:03:23.798]  It blew up.
[01:03:24.098 --> 01:03:26.320]  She went public today, big time.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.802]  Again, chain reaction explosion.
[01:03:31.039 --> 01:03:35.725]  And there, I mean, we are ramming down the New World Order's gates right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:37.607]  We are ramming down their keeps.
[01:03:38.168 --> 01:03:40.110]  We are ramming down their fortresses.
[01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:42.272]  We are entering the city.
[01:03:42.813 --> 01:03:48.640]  We now are engaging the enemy at point-blank range!
[01:03:56.377 --> 01:04:01.827]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.208 --> 01:04:09.821]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.515 --> 01:04:17.578]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.978 --> 01:04:29.403]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.703 --> 01:04:33.645]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.665 --> 01:04:35.626]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.946 --> 01:04:39.788]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:52.924 --> 01:04:58.007]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:04:58.067 --> 01:05:05.392]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:05:05.532 --> 01:05:16.158]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:05:16.378 --> 01:05:20.921]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:21.181 --> 01:05:26.184]  Unbelievably, they even remove small microparticulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[01:05:26.385 --> 01:05:29.327]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:29.567 --> 01:05:39.373]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[01:05:53.182 --> 01:05:54.982]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:05:55.062 --> 01:05:56.362]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:05:56.542 --> 01:05:59.363]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:05:59.743 --> 01:06:02.504]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:06:03.024 --> 01:06:09.746]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:06:35.017 --> 01:06:35.237]  Call 877-873-9626.
[01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:35.557]  That's 877-873-9626.
[01:06:35.577 --> 01:06:38.859]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:21.079 --> 01:07:22.519]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.540]  We are now into the second hour, eight minutes into it.
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:29.701]  Ricardo Luna, Rick Luna, is going to be our guest.
[01:07:32.336 --> 01:07:33.757]  In studio here in just a few minutes.
[01:07:33.797 --> 01:07:37.659]  In fact, he's here with us and his son has been beaten, tortured, sexually abused.
[01:07:38.719 --> 01:07:41.321]  He's seen, I mean you name it.
[01:07:42.369 --> 01:07:45.190]  It all started with pushing a hall monitor.
[01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:50.071]  We've got endless guests we could have on whose children would bust out a window on accident.
[01:07:50.631 --> 01:07:53.312]  I mean, how many of us busted out windows not on accident?
[01:07:53.632 --> 01:07:57.333]  You know, it's some old shack out in the woods you found and you shot it with a BB gun.
[01:07:57.713 --> 01:08:01.194]  Boom, folks, we're talking six years in rape rooms.
[01:08:01.794 --> 01:08:02.095]  Okay?
[01:08:02.135 --> 01:08:04.015]  I mean, one offense, boom, you're gone.
[01:08:04.815 --> 01:08:10.997]  This is the type of families that we've talked to, people we've had discussions with, and
[01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:12.834]  It's just amazing.
[01:08:13.034 --> 01:08:17.556]  It's absolutely amazing the things that go on in this world.
[01:08:17.576 --> 01:08:23.237]  So we'll be talking about that with Ginger Galloway here in just a few minutes.
[01:08:24.758 --> 01:08:31.599]  And we'll also be talking to our other guest, Ricardo Luna, here in studio.
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:37.101]  And I could spend the entire show, every day, three hours a day, just about
[01:08:38.286 --> 01:08:39.927]  The government and what they do to the children.
[01:08:40.468 --> 01:08:45.532]  It is confirmed that over 3,000 plus children are missing in Florida that the CPS took.
[01:08:46.333 --> 01:08:47.153]  That was on CNN.
[01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:50.436]  But when the story finally broke a few years ago, it was just shut down.
[01:08:51.397 --> 01:08:57.402]  You heard the latest numbers, 640 plus of them are under three years of age.
[01:08:58.322 --> 01:08:59.804]  They have found quite a few of them dead.
[01:09:00.104 --> 01:09:01.565]  Some have been found in foreign countries.
[01:09:02.206 --> 01:09:04.908]  The top three individuals running the Department of CPS
[01:09:05.968 --> 01:09:07.670]  It's got another acronym in Florida.
[01:09:08.050 --> 01:09:09.652]  We're a convicted child rapist.
[01:09:10.393 --> 01:09:18.361]  It has now turned out that large portions of the Texas Youth Commission were convicted child rapists or pornographers.
[01:09:19.062 --> 01:09:22.786]  Many others have felonies for assault, robbery, armed robbery.
[01:09:23.636 --> 01:09:26.198]  And it's called the untouchables in the state.
[01:09:26.498 --> 01:09:27.419]  This was testified.
[01:09:27.499 --> 01:09:28.440]  We sent Kevin Smith down.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:33.483]  He shot like four or five hours of video in hearings that Mr. Luna and others were in yesterday.
[01:09:33.844 --> 01:09:36.846]  Every time really serious stuff got brought up, they would tell them not to testify.
[01:09:36.886 --> 01:09:40.649]  They give them to investigators, who then all our evidence shows run giant whitewashes.
[01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:43.291]  The investigation itself is to cover everything up.
[01:09:43.951 --> 01:09:45.432]  Even the legislature said that.
[01:09:45.472 --> 01:09:49.115]  Governor Perry is covering it all up right now and not allowing others to stop.
[01:09:50.218 --> 01:09:55.260]  Of course, 93% of those in the system had their sentences increased.
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.281]  Let's say you're given a year for busting out a window.
[01:09:57.561 --> 01:09:58.241]  You never get out.
[01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:03.903]  In fact, then they recommend you go to prison when you get out at 19 and then you spend a few more years in the prison.
[01:10:05.824 --> 01:10:07.045]  I said I'd get to this in a few minutes.
[01:10:08.145 --> 01:10:10.786]  Understand folks, I cannot tell you how bad it is.
[01:10:11.506 --> 01:10:16.108]  You do not know until you're at Breckenridge at the hospital.
[01:10:17.174 --> 01:10:24.060]  And a family calls you who have no criminal record, who are a happy, good-looking family, good people.
[01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:25.581]  You later get into the case.
[01:10:25.601 --> 01:10:26.922]  You find out they have no record.
[01:10:27.642 --> 01:10:28.983]  The reports are admittedly false.
[01:10:30.004 --> 01:10:30.525]  You show up.
[01:10:30.545 --> 01:10:31.785]  The guy's an auto mechanic.
[01:10:32.146 --> 01:10:33.267]  They're living in a little apartment.
[01:10:33.287 --> 01:10:33.907]  They're poor.
[01:10:34.608 --> 01:10:35.648]  Hell, my parents were poor.
[01:10:35.668 --> 01:10:38.871]  My dad was putting himself through medical school until I was four.
[01:10:39.952 --> 01:10:43.795]  You know, they lived in a little bitty house, and sometimes there wasn't even that much food to eat, folks.
[01:10:44.435 --> 01:10:45.136]  You really want to know.
[01:10:45.376 --> 01:10:46.577]  Well, now they just take your kids.
[01:10:47.529 --> 01:10:52.830]  And, uh, they, uh, it's just hell on earth, folks.
[01:10:53.731 --> 01:10:57.812]  You go and you're on the cell phone and you're talking to the father and he's going, the cops are in here.
[01:10:58.152 --> 01:11:00.152]  They're telling her, you gotta, they gotta sign it.
[01:11:00.632 --> 01:11:03.713]  And then they've been putting their hands on her and squeezing her neck.
[01:11:03.753 --> 01:11:05.613]  And you're, and you're thinking, well, maybe this guy's crazy.
[01:11:05.653 --> 01:11:07.714]  Maybe the, this family's actually lying to me.
[01:11:08.154 --> 01:11:09.774]  And you're walking down the hospital hall.
[01:11:10.255 --> 01:11:11.995]  You don't ask the desk, you don't ask permission.
[01:11:12.195 --> 01:11:15.756]  You got a camera behind you and you open the door and the cop's choking a woman.
[01:11:16.787 --> 01:11:18.467]  I mean, folks, I have seen it.
[01:11:18.587 --> 01:11:20.688]  You don't know how evil it is.
[01:11:20.728 --> 01:11:21.928]  You want to bring them to justice.
[01:11:21.968 --> 01:11:23.248]  You want to see them get them in trouble.
[01:11:23.568 --> 01:11:24.769]  And they're always the same type.
[01:11:24.809 --> 01:11:30.150]  They're these nelly, effeminate male cops and these butch female cops.
[01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:31.250]  And they just love it.
[01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:35.111]  And they smile and they giggle as the families cry.
[01:11:35.171 --> 01:11:40.092]  You can see them demonically feeding off the women when they cry for their babies.
[01:11:40.672 --> 01:11:42.193]  It was about five and a half years ago.
[01:12:06.872 --> 01:12:24.903]  Now there's so many victims I've dealt with that I saw you at the TV station the other night and you were showing me pictures of your son and stuff and I just said I remember meeting you and I don't really remember the story and little did I know I'd already told my producer the day before to get you on air and you were all over Texas newspapers and there was the very person I wanted to see but I didn't put two and two together.
[01:12:25.304 --> 01:12:27.905]  My point is it's just wall to wall victims ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:27.965 --> 01:12:29.406]  I cannot describe how evil it is.
[01:12:29.987 --> 01:12:32.908]  In a nutshell, you just heard me talking about these people.
[01:12:34.608 --> 01:12:36.611]  Have you ever experienced them acting like this?
[01:12:36.891 --> 01:12:37.412]  The pleasure?
[01:12:37.432 --> 01:12:39.795]  Oh, yes, I have.
[01:12:41.778 --> 01:12:48.387]  They are kind of, they abuse these children instead of, you know, we put them in their hands of the state.
[01:12:49.082 --> 01:12:56.486]  Thinking that they're going to be protected, and they get beat up, they get assaulted, and we can't do nothing about it.
[01:12:56.926 --> 01:12:59.587]  Well, I said to myself, I am going to do something about it.
[01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:05.430]  Even though they were retaliating on my son, I was pushing this to the legislatures.
[01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:07.971]  I was telling them, look here, my son's getting beat up.
[01:13:08.412 --> 01:13:09.832]  He's a child with disabilities.
[01:13:09.872 --> 01:13:11.393]  He does not belong at TYC.
[01:13:11.753 --> 01:13:15.315]  TYC released him under the Bill 1550 for mentally impaired offenders.
[01:13:15.755 --> 01:13:28.465]  And then he, just, Gene Mayer knows that my son had a disability, turns around, MHMR jumps his IQ to 71 after the IQ was done by the Texas Youth Commission to be released under 48 IQ.
[01:13:28.525 --> 01:13:31.227]  That's seriously retarded.
[01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:35.510]  That's mental, that's, let's not say, that's um, male.
[01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:36.151]  Okay.
[01:13:38.172 --> 01:13:40.454]  Well, 70 is mild retardation.
[01:13:40.534 --> 01:13:42.895]  Well, 70 is not mentally retarded.
[01:13:43.196 --> 01:13:43.816]  Oh, according to them.
[01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:43.916]  Okay.
[01:13:44.036 --> 01:13:47.718]  According to them, anything under 70 is considered mentally retarded.
[01:13:48.219 --> 01:13:48.859]  Okay.
[01:13:49.059 --> 01:13:52.982]  But he had an IQ of 69 at the age of 11 when he was going to school.
[01:13:53.522 --> 01:13:54.783]  And they knew it, and we knew it.
[01:13:55.223 --> 01:13:59.826]  And we were trying to tell him, you know, he does not belong in an institutional-like setting.
[01:14:00.147 --> 01:14:01.928]  He needs to be getting a third.
[01:14:02.765 --> 01:14:05.246]  He needed to be on a farm, probably.
[01:14:05.286 --> 01:14:08.188]  Just out, you know, having milk and cows, living a good life.
[01:14:08.228 --> 01:14:09.448]  ADDHD, you know.
[01:14:09.849 --> 01:14:10.969]  Mentally retarded.
[01:14:11.109 --> 01:14:12.170]  And then, bipolar.
[01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:16.192]  You know, and what happened is Jean Muir knew.
[01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:18.893]  She said, I'm keeping up with you.
[01:14:19.493 --> 01:14:25.957]  Turns around eight months later and sends him right back to TYC, knowing he couldn't do the program.
[01:14:26.097 --> 01:14:27.277]  I remember interviewing you years ago.
[01:14:27.357 --> 01:14:29.939]  She yelled and screamed at you and told you to divorce your wife.
[01:14:30.119 --> 01:14:30.739]  Yes, she did.
[01:14:31.798 --> 01:14:32.418]  That's what they do.
[01:14:44.346 --> 01:14:47.988]  And because she can only stay with us about 15 minutes to tell her story.
[01:14:48.008 --> 01:14:49.088]  She's also got some breaking news.
[01:14:49.128 --> 01:14:54.950]  She was there at the hearing yesterday at the State Capitol, just a few miles from where we sit right now.
[01:14:55.331 --> 01:15:03.454]  Ginger, just in a nutshell, can you tell us about what happened with your family and just crystallize it down and then tell us the breaking news that just came out?
[01:15:04.134 --> 01:15:04.454]  Sure.
[01:15:08.776 --> 01:15:11.057]  My son was sentenced in 2003.
[01:15:11.097 --> 01:15:12.418]  He was charged with
[01:15:13.248 --> 01:15:15.089]  inappropriately touching his sibling.
[01:15:17.971 --> 01:15:25.016]  And he was... we were told... I'm sorry.
[01:15:25.636 --> 01:15:27.838]  Yeah, your phone's cutting out a bit.
[01:15:27.878 --> 01:15:28.878]  Okay, can you hear me now?
[01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:29.179]  Is that okay?
[01:15:29.199 --> 01:15:29.579]  Sure, sure.
[01:15:29.619 --> 01:15:31.080]  Are there other folks on the line with you?
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.261]  Right, I just turned it off and we had another one on.
[01:15:33.281 --> 01:15:35.603]  Sorry about that.
[01:15:35.783 --> 01:15:37.164]  It's okay, go ahead.
[01:15:37.544 --> 01:15:39.926]  In 2003, they sent us and told us he'd be there nine months.
[01:15:40.306 --> 01:15:41.547]  He's been there for four years.
[01:15:43.016 --> 01:15:45.678]  He has suffered broken noses.
[01:15:45.818 --> 01:15:46.958]  He's had his nose broken.
[01:15:47.219 --> 01:15:49.099]  He's had his jaw broken in two places.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.320]  His mouth wired shut.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.542]  He was rushed by ambulance to the hospital after an assault.
[01:15:53.962 --> 01:15:55.823]  His orbital bone has been bruised.
[01:15:55.983 --> 01:15:58.144]  His body has been covered with contusions.
[01:15:59.425 --> 01:16:04.407]  He was denied medical care when he was gagging with his teeth wired shut.
[01:16:04.447 --> 01:16:07.129]  He was told to let the vomit run through the cracks in his teeth.
[01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:11.131]  He has been molested by female staff when he was 15.
[01:16:12.446 --> 01:16:17.147]  He was locked up in a security cell that was only supposed to house one inmate.
[01:16:17.607 --> 01:16:18.947]  Now, let's be clear though.
[01:16:19.907 --> 01:16:24.168]  Again, if you stop on the highway and use the bathroom behind a tree, that is a sexual crime now.
[01:16:25.488 --> 01:16:33.930]  Children as young as six years of age, if they kiss a girl at school, which we all did, that's called a sexual crime now.
[01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.510]  That's right.
[01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:36.070]  I mean, let's go back though.
[01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:38.811]  Let's explain because, I mean, we were at the hearing yesterday.
[01:16:39.131 --> 01:16:41.251]  People in jail for six years for a broken window.
[01:16:42.394 --> 01:16:43.815]  I mean, this is America, folks.
[01:16:43.975 --> 01:16:44.575]  Exactly.
[01:16:44.615 --> 01:16:46.597]  And meanwhile, they're being raped inside the government.
[01:16:46.917 --> 01:16:47.878]  I mean, the U.S.
[01:16:47.918 --> 01:16:49.439]  Attorney wrote, and the U.S.
[01:16:49.459 --> 01:16:51.640]  Prosecutor wrote letters saying, maybe the kids like it.
[01:16:52.061 --> 01:16:55.083]  So this is open evil, right out in the open.
[01:16:56.144 --> 01:17:01.027]  Yes, folks, they really said that it's not abuse, and that it may be consensual, and that maybe they like it.
[01:17:01.828 --> 01:17:04.110]  How did your son originally get into their clutches?
[01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:07.332]  He inappropriately touched his siblings.
[01:17:08.119 --> 01:17:14.124]  He was 14 years old and I thought I was doing the right thing by calling the authorities and asking for help.
[01:17:14.224 --> 01:17:15.965]  I thought that they would truly help us.
[01:17:16.025 --> 01:17:17.646]  And that's because the news told you to.
[01:17:17.686 --> 01:17:18.667]  Now let's be clear.
[01:17:19.207 --> 01:17:28.514]  Instead of keeping it in the family and having discipline and finding out why this happened, and I'm not trying to blame you, but I'm trying to warn others not to do this.
[01:17:29.167 --> 01:17:38.914]  Well, you know, if I had to do it over again, I would maybe do it different, but I was assaulted when I was a child, and I never wanted my children to say, you know, I was doing the right thing.
[01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:40.935]  I didn't want them to say I didn't do the right thing.
[01:17:40.955 --> 01:17:47.880]  No, I understand, because you thought the government was good, but let me tell you, statistically, there's no one worse, they're five times more likely to abuse.
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:54.965]  That's right, and the judge actually released my son to us, and in the very same day, we brought him home, five minutes later,
[01:17:55.445 --> 01:17:55.745]  We're good.
[01:18:12.239 --> 01:18:19.145]  Within an hour later, he was put right back through the judge and put into TYC because our county had no funds.
[01:18:19.165 --> 01:18:25.551]  And that's because they get more federal funding each arrest, so they make the release to keep laundering the profits off of that.
[01:18:25.571 --> 01:18:26.732]  Well, let's talk about this.
[01:18:28.413 --> 01:18:37.001]  We've got to get Kevin Smith in here, because he heard all this money about Gladiator Night and the rape rooms and just hell on earth, folks.
[01:18:37.381 --> 01:18:39.003]  We'll be right back with Ginger Galloway.
[01:18:39.933 --> 01:18:42.198]  And how her family got into this system.
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:49.171]  Out of the frying pan, into the 9th circle of Hades, the government is totally illegitimate and blown out.
[01:18:49.271 --> 01:18:50.113]  You understand that folks?
[01:18:53.925 --> 01:19:00.434]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:19:00.654 --> 01:19:04.699]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:07.083]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:10.187]  All Natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem.
[01:19:10.467 --> 01:19:14.450]  The dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[01:19:14.770 --> 01:19:17.392]  Non-X nail gel is absolutely amazing!
[01:19:17.652 --> 01:19:21.174]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[01:19:21.434 --> 01:19:24.356]  Non-X nail gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[01:19:24.636 --> 01:19:29.299]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:31.201]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:19:31.481 --> 01:19:34.903]  You'll find Non-X gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X.
[01:19:35.283 --> 01:19:35.483]  I think.
[01:19:54.765 --> 01:19:56.106]  Hi, Ted Anderson for Midas.
[01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:57.607]  It's March 28, 2007.
[01:19:58.087 --> 01:20:11.716]  Gold is at $6.67, and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $6.93, $3.47.62 for half ounce, and $1.73.81 for quarter ounce coins at $6.93, $3.47.62, and $1.73.81.
[01:20:11.897 --> 01:20:15.559]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[01:20:15.599 --> 01:20:18.641]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[01:20:18.741 --> 01:20:24.445]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document.
[01:20:24.865 --> 01:20:33.627]  Clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control, this will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[01:20:34.107 --> 01:20:36.427]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[01:20:36.467 --> 01:20:38.948]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[01:20:39.328 --> 01:20:41.008]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:20:41.068 --> 01:20:42.448]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[01:20:42.468 --> 01:20:42.688]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:42.728 --> 01:20:43.008]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.152 --> 01:20:56.174]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:20:56.474 --> 01:21:01.397]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:21:01.658 --> 01:21:06.020]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:21:06.301 --> 01:21:15.226]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[01:21:15.427 --> 01:21:19.029]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[01:21:19.329 --> 01:21:24.377]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:21:24.657 --> 01:21:31.367]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:21:31.866 --> 01:21:32.526]  What about you?
[01:21:33.167 --> 01:21:38.530]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:21:54.918 --> 01:21:59.061]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:21:59.282 --> 01:22:01.043]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:22:01.303 --> 01:22:07.588]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:22:07.888 --> 01:22:14.013]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:22:14.254 --> 01:22:16.015]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:22:16.015 --> 01:22:16.315]  We're good.
[01:22:40.061 --> 01:22:42.703]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625 That's 1-866-885-6625 1-866-885-6625
[01:23:01.696 --> 01:23:03.117]  Ginger Galloway has got to leave us.
[01:23:03.397 --> 01:23:05.478]  Mr. Loon will be with us into the next hour.
[01:23:05.518 --> 01:23:08.639]  We do have the Rosie O'Donnell clip, incredible, going public on 9-11.
[01:23:08.659 --> 01:23:09.760]  It's 11 minutes, not 9.
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:11.700]  I just watched some of it.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:15.062]  We'll be airing it at the start, or about 15 minutes into the next hour.
[01:23:16.102 --> 01:23:20.404]  And getting back into that huge news there, I have a huge stack of news I haven't even covered.
[01:23:20.424 --> 01:23:22.165]  The Iran thing is continuing to heat up.
[01:23:22.285 --> 01:23:23.605]  But, you know what?
[01:23:23.706 --> 01:23:24.766]  They attack Iran.
[01:23:24.806 --> 01:23:26.447]  Tens of thousands of Iranians die.
[01:23:26.827 --> 01:23:28.207]  Thousands of our troops may die.
[01:23:28.688 --> 01:23:29.188]  Meanwhile,
[01:23:30.274 --> 01:23:32.676]  Three thousand plus missing children in Florida.
[01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:38.780]  Folks, in Florida it is so bad, they just take them and it's literally run by pedophile rings and you never see them.
[01:23:39.081 --> 01:23:44.865]  And then the governor, this is on the news, this is in the Miami paper, they just say, no, we don't know where they are, don't ask.
[01:23:44.905 --> 01:23:47.607]  It's like the Pentagon with almost four trillion missing.
[01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:51.910]  And we played the clips of the different
[01:23:52.461 --> 01:23:54.622]  Meetings in Congress, and they say, where's the trillions?
[01:23:54.642 --> 01:23:55.882]  And I go, we're not going to tell you!
[01:23:56.463 --> 01:23:59.104]  I mean, that's what we've reached here in this country.
[01:23:59.164 --> 01:24:01.685]  So, what do you do when the government's totally bankrupt?
[01:24:02.465 --> 01:24:07.927]  When they're always, in every case, statistically many times worse than the worst elements of the public?
[01:24:08.367 --> 01:24:09.828]  Because they are the bad elements!
[01:24:10.928 --> 01:24:18.251]  Ginger, you've got some breaking news, but without getting into profanity, and I know you did in testimony because it was exactly what happened, they would also
[01:24:19.722 --> 01:24:23.905]  With your son, it was said, hey, there's also racial stuff going on.
[01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:30.591]  You know, you got an 18-year-old large black guy in there, your son's 14 or 15, and they say, I want to rape me that white boy.
[01:24:30.931 --> 01:24:33.493]  And then, of course, not just the raping, but the breaking of bones.
[01:24:33.733 --> 01:24:34.634]  Can you talk about that?
[01:24:35.735 --> 01:24:36.455]  Yeah.
[01:24:37.076 --> 01:24:43.000]  The security officer pushed my son in a locked cell with a bigger, older boy that was begging for it.
[01:24:43.901 --> 01:24:47.624]  And he locked the door behind him, and he stood there and listened while
[01:24:48.911 --> 01:24:50.492]  The 18-year-old raped my son.
[01:24:50.772 --> 01:24:55.375]  He beat him, he raped him, sodomized him, left him lying there in blood.
[01:24:56.416 --> 01:24:58.457]  And my son has bled recklessly ever since.
[01:24:58.477 --> 01:25:00.358]  For the last four years.
[01:25:00.819 --> 01:25:01.839]  He held it inside.
[01:25:02.299 --> 01:25:06.802]  He didn't tell anyone because he was scared that he would be labeled a punk and it would happen again.
[01:25:06.822 --> 01:25:14.347]  And, um, two weeks after that... Well, I tell you, years later, that fella that did that ought to get a visit.
[01:25:14.967 --> 01:25:15.688]  He killed himself.
[01:25:16.733 --> 01:25:17.193]  Oh, that's right.
[01:25:17.233 --> 01:25:18.714]  People always do kill themselves.
[01:25:19.035 --> 01:25:20.416]  We were just talking about that yesterday.
[01:25:20.436 --> 01:25:25.799]  They always seem to get their heads blown off by their own hand, or their wife's hand, or their husband's hand, or they die in that car wreck.
[01:25:26.239 --> 01:25:28.541]  Oh, tell me about the guard committing suicide.
[01:25:29.382 --> 01:25:33.765]  Well, we found out that a couple weeks after this happened, he committed suicide.
[01:25:34.745 --> 01:25:37.507]  I guess over the guilt, I would imagine.
[01:25:38.448 --> 01:25:43.391]  I'm not real sure on that, but all I know is I haven't gotten any more details other than
[01:25:45.546 --> 01:25:49.309]  They called the boys in for so-called grief counseling.
[01:25:49.429 --> 01:25:55.213]  I think it was more or less an interrogation, a couple weeks after he had done it.
[01:25:57.014 --> 01:26:06.481]  Bottom line, Ginger, how did you get involved in this now, since your son told you about it, and what did you see at the testimony yesterday and the hearings?
[01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:08.542]  You've also got some breaking news for folks.
[01:26:08.963 --> 01:26:09.983]  Well, I got involved.
[01:26:10.043 --> 01:26:11.805]  I started making phone calls.
[01:26:11.845 --> 01:26:14.607]  I called TKage and was put into
[01:26:16.266 --> 01:26:31.137]  Contact with several media reps and I just started getting it out in the media and then the more we got it out in the media and I started testifying before Senate in the House and telling them how I felt and what happened to us and then we were retaliated against.
[01:26:31.237 --> 01:26:42.126]  It just got worse and worse but the bigger it got, you know, the more media it seemed like the faster everybody was moving and yesterday the testimony just repulsed me.
[01:26:42.466 --> 01:26:43.987]  Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse
[01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:57.792]  The stories that came from some of these parents were the most sickening, sad, pitiful things that just break your heart to think that these children have been going through what they've been going through for so long and nobody cared.
[01:26:57.952 --> 01:26:59.594]  Well, that's the religion of the elite.
[01:26:59.694 --> 01:27:05.939]  I think as you learn more, you're going to find out this is actually, they enjoy inflicting pain.
[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:07.781]  It's a cult of power.
[01:27:08.772 --> 01:27:17.981]  Yeah, I know that the rocks that I have unturned, you know, have really uncovered a lot of things that it was more or less like a mafia.
[01:27:18.342 --> 01:27:22.586]  The upper level administrative positions were in a crew called the Untouchables.
[01:27:23.006 --> 01:27:24.408]  That's what they nicknamed themselves.
[01:27:24.848 --> 01:27:27.411]  And they even had a motto and it was to hell with everyone.
[01:27:28.191 --> 01:27:32.636]  And the leaders were basically the administrative people in authority.
[01:27:33.095 --> 01:27:43.522]  And every facility was run in their own little way, with their own little kingdom, and they all had their little untouchable groups, which were expendable, of course, if they didn't obey their kingdom leaders.
[01:27:44.922 --> 01:27:46.323]  Rick, you want to comment on the untouchables?
[01:27:46.343 --> 01:27:49.585]  Oh yes, this happens in all facilities.
[01:27:49.945 --> 01:27:54.889]  These staff, you know, for fun, they bring stuff in for the kids.
[01:27:57.719 --> 01:28:04.643]  A lot of times they bring in drugs, they bring in, you know, candy just to bribe them.
[01:28:05.364 --> 01:28:10.907]  My son was beat up by another kid that the staff told to beat up my son.
[01:28:12.348 --> 01:28:15.050]  You know, I know you've got a few other things that you need to tell us.
[01:28:15.130 --> 01:28:20.293]  Is there a way to keep you about five minutes in the next hour, Ginger, so you can tell us about the new development where they're going to fire all the jail guards?
[01:28:22.418 --> 01:28:23.179]  Well, yeah.
[01:28:23.419 --> 01:28:23.779]  Go ahead.
[01:28:24.219 --> 01:28:25.240]  I'll stay a few more minutes.
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:26.821]  I know you've got to go to another meeting.
[01:28:26.881 --> 01:28:27.622]  It's a three-minute break.
[01:28:27.642 --> 01:28:29.463]  Just come back and tell us that breaking news and we'll let you go.
[01:28:30.184 --> 01:28:31.765]  And there's no way to ever cover all this.
[01:28:31.845 --> 01:28:32.205]  I understand.
[01:28:32.225 --> 01:28:35.848]  We'll have to have you back up in the next few weeks as we continue to try to fight all of this.
[01:28:37.109 --> 01:28:41.872]  Now again, at some of these facilities, ladies and gentlemen, they had huge rape parties.
[01:28:42.012 --> 01:28:42.793]  We'll be back.
[01:28:43.513 --> 01:28:44.414]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.894 --> 01:28:46.495]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.416 --> 01:28:50.098]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.113 --> 01:28:54.533]  Attention!
[01:28:54.633 --> 01:28:57.455]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[01:28:57.755 --> 01:29:02.058]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:29:02.378 --> 01:29:03.059]  Listen closely.
[01:29:03.719 --> 01:29:11.184]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[01:29:11.464 --> 01:29:20.230]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:26.054]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[01:29:26.334 --> 01:29:35.741]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[01:29:36.001 --> 01:29:41.626]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[01:29:41.826 --> 01:29:45.390]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:48.953]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:54.801 --> 01:30:01.584]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two book set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[01:30:01.965 --> 01:30:08.368]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[01:30:08.848 --> 01:30:18.754]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[01:30:19.214 --> 01:30:22.676]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[01:30:22.976 --> 01:30:25.677]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[01:30:26.297 --> 01:30:28.998]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[01:30:29.539 --> 01:30:31.459]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.

[01:30:53.616 --> 01:30:59.651]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:31:00.233 --> 01:31:01.536]  Globalists are concerned with what's
[01:31:08.482 --> 01:31:08.942]  I think so.
[01:31:25.976 --> 01:31:26.496]  I think so.
[01:32:00.917 --> 01:32:03.099]  The New World Order trying to warn the people.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.001]  Kendra Galloway finishing up.
[01:32:06.041 --> 01:32:10.245]  What's the new breaking news that you can tell us that came out at the hearing and after the hearing?
[01:32:10.745 --> 01:32:15.949]  Well, Jay Kimbrough, as you know probably, yesterday at 1 o'clock was named conservator.
[01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:17.571]  Official conservator.
[01:32:17.611 --> 01:32:19.512]  That gives him the right to hire and fire.
[01:32:19.732 --> 01:32:21.434]  That makes him the man in charge.
[01:32:23.627 --> 01:32:25.589]  And that's the Governor's special master.
[01:32:26.110 --> 01:32:30.013]  Yes, but they've given him the conservatorship, which is a good thing, I believe.
[01:32:30.173 --> 01:32:35.659]  Because I did see him immediately, you know, they were reaming him for going out and doing his job.
[01:32:35.979 --> 01:32:45.468]  And what he did is, when he sent out investigators, I know within 24 hours I had investigators at my house and trying to get down to the bottom and find out who had done what to my son.
[01:32:45.989 --> 01:32:48.151]  And I had employees lined up at my house.
[01:32:48.499 --> 01:32:50.920]  To meet the investigators and tell them their story.
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:33:00.223]  Now the new development though is they're going to fire all of these jail guards that had the felonies and then allow them to reapply.
[01:33:00.664 --> 01:33:07.406]  What they're doing is every single executive, every top, he's going to clean house from top to bottom.
[01:33:07.846 --> 01:33:17.630]  But he is starting with the top executive in Austin and he's making them, the superintendent, the assistant superintendent, and anyone with a previous felony conviction
[01:33:18.038 --> 01:33:23.581]  They have to fill out an application as if they're having to, you know, completely re-acclimatize... Well, Ginger, I've got to be honest with you.
[01:33:23.621 --> 01:33:24.781]  This isn't my first rodeo.
[01:33:24.841 --> 01:33:28.403]  I've been covering this for, you know, over 12 years.
[01:33:28.923 --> 01:33:32.905]  And so I know how these people operate, and I understand you want to think this guy's good.
[01:33:32.925 --> 01:33:35.946]  I just don't have any faith in Rick Perry.
[01:33:36.006 --> 01:33:37.447]  He is manifestly wicked.
[01:33:38.087 --> 01:33:47.532]  And I would just add to that that what we've seen in the past is they talk a good talk, but then you're going to find in the investigation they're going to have a few sacrificial lambs, but it's going to overall be a...
[01:33:48.553 --> 01:33:50.374]  Well, I really have faith in Jay Kimbrough.
[01:33:50.494 --> 01:33:51.215]  I really do.
[01:33:51.235 --> 01:33:56.518]  I can't say that I have faith in everybody else, but I believe that Jay Kimbrough is working for us.
[01:34:08.582 --> 01:34:12.444]  And I truly have faith in him and the investigations that are going on.
[01:34:12.464 --> 01:34:13.925]  Sure, how many arrests have there been though?
[01:34:13.985 --> 01:34:15.506]  I mean, how many arrests have there been so far?
[01:34:15.566 --> 01:34:27.632]  I mean, they had the Texas Rangers... See, the reason that they couldn't do more arrests is because the House and the Senate was arguing over whether or not he had the authority by the governor because he wasn't an announced official conservator, he was the special master.
[01:34:27.692 --> 01:34:29.232]  But see, we have probable cause.
[01:34:29.412 --> 01:34:34.575]  Sheriffs in every county should be doing raids on those places and doing interviews
[01:34:35.155 --> 01:34:35.856]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:34:52.208 --> 01:34:55.450]  We have no choice than to do what they say.
[01:34:55.531 --> 01:34:58.172]  You talk about nightmares.
[01:34:58.833 --> 01:34:59.654]  We had a camera there.
[01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:01.215]  I reviewed some of the footage last night.
[01:35:01.235 --> 01:35:01.955]  There's hours of it.
[01:35:01.975 --> 01:35:02.876]  I couldn't watch it all.
[01:35:02.916 --> 01:35:04.917]  I was told it was nightmarish by the cameraman.
[01:35:05.698 --> 01:35:09.761]  Just in the last 60 seconds or so, I know you've got to go, and then we're going to talk to Mr. Luna.
[01:35:10.181 --> 01:35:11.462]  What types of horror stories?
[01:35:14.044 --> 01:35:20.329]  There's horror stories from children who have pictures of before and after going into a treatment facility.
[01:35:21.155 --> 01:35:35.250]  On medication and then the difference in the physical appearance where they've actually mutilated themselves, not having any medication, being denied medical care, kids being brutally raped, kids being tortured.
[01:35:35.370 --> 01:35:37.232]  You know, it's terrible.
[01:35:37.953 --> 01:35:39.695]  There are good people that work there.
[01:35:40.135 --> 01:35:41.657]  I'm not saying every one of them are bad.
[01:35:42.489 --> 01:35:46.130]  But they need to get rid of the bad people and they don't need to get to resign.
[01:35:46.230 --> 01:35:50.530]  Every one of them or this type of stuff is going on is evil.
[01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:59.192]  It is worse to sit there and to be lukewarm and to know they're raping children and to know it's going on and go, well, the system's corrupt, I can't do anything.
[01:35:59.212 --> 01:35:59.892]  I agree.
[01:35:59.952 --> 01:36:10.134]  This would have never happened if people, you know, 50 years ago when this started would have said no and we wouldn't know about this if it wasn't for a good Texas Ranger who was told to shut up and wouldn't.
[01:36:10.794 --> 01:36:11.034]  Right.
[01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:15.261]  We need to realize just how bad it is.
[01:36:15.561 --> 01:36:18.062]  Well listen, I appreciate you coming on and spending time with us.
[01:36:18.363 --> 01:36:22.966]  Are there any websites, any phone numbers, any contact for people out there that want to help you?
[01:36:23.206 --> 01:36:24.146]  How do folks get involved?
[01:36:24.166 --> 01:36:24.907]  How do they fight this?
[01:36:25.347 --> 01:36:29.250]  Well, they can contact the Texas Coalition Advocating Justice for Juveniles.
[01:36:30.991 --> 01:36:33.092]  I know that that's a wonderful organization.
[01:36:33.132 --> 01:36:34.493]  They're fighting for kids' rights.
[01:36:35.342 --> 01:36:38.184]  And they can look me up in the phone book or on the internet.
[01:36:38.244 --> 01:36:42.466]  Just type in my name, G-E-N-G-E-R, Galloway, and they'll get information.
[01:36:42.486 --> 01:36:43.186]  Where do you live?
[01:36:43.366 --> 01:36:44.567]  I live in Crockett, Texas.
[01:36:44.787 --> 01:36:46.428]  Alright, well thank you for spending time with us.
[01:36:46.728 --> 01:36:50.130]  Oh, and is your son still in the torture facility?
[01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:52.731]  No, he's in another torture facility.
[01:36:53.131 --> 01:36:54.272]  But I met with him this morning.
[01:36:54.292 --> 01:36:56.453]  They're really trying to get him out to shut me up.
[01:36:57.253 --> 01:37:03.457]  They're trying to just process him right on through really quickly and they think it's just going to make me be quiet, but I got news for them.
[01:37:03.497 --> 01:37:05.538]  There's too many other kids out there for me to fight for.
[01:37:06.038 --> 01:37:11.422]  Well, I mean the reports of how many, and I've got Dallas Morning News here, of the large percentage of girls that get pregnant in there.
[01:37:11.922 --> 01:37:12.282]  Yeah.
[01:37:12.502 --> 01:37:21.648]  I mean, boy, these guards are, I mean, if you're a pedophile and you want to rape little girls, folks, go become a jail guard at one of these juvie systems and if you like to rape little boys or young men, this is the place.
[01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:25.481]  Yeah, it's a sick, sick world.
[01:37:25.861 --> 01:37:30.964]  Well, they run things, and they got the machine guns, and they got the helicopters, and they don't plan to stop.
[01:37:31.044 --> 01:37:33.646]  Let me assure you, we're going to have to fight them to stop them.
[01:37:33.666 --> 01:37:34.747]  Ginger, thanks for joining us.
[01:37:34.927 --> 01:37:35.767]  Thank you very much.
[01:37:35.807 --> 01:37:36.127]  Bye-bye.
[01:37:36.247 --> 01:37:36.588]  You bet.
[01:37:37.988 --> 01:37:40.570]  What has it been like for you, Rick, all these years?
[01:37:40.590 --> 01:37:47.374]  I mean, I tell the story, I don't even know, Rick, if it makes sense to listeners, that I have
[01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:51.154]  Because years ago, we went to dozens of CPS cases.
[01:37:51.234 --> 01:38:00.907]  We dealt with dozens of folks like you, had you on TV and radio, and Mike and others, and Kevin went to some of your trials with your son, and witnessed all this.
[01:38:00.927 --> 01:38:04.732]  And then it becomes a blur, and then I see you down there, I guess you're going on another TV show.
[01:38:05.313 --> 01:38:06.074]  Were you on The Ritter Show?
[01:38:06.764 --> 01:38:06.964]  Yes.
[01:38:07.465 --> 01:38:08.165]  Yeah, good folks.
[01:38:08.866 --> 01:38:10.567]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[01:38:10.587 --> 01:38:17.653]  And then, it was funny, I was looking for you earlier that day and looking for you that night and then I saw your picture and I went, wait, that's the same Rick.
[01:38:17.893 --> 01:38:19.835]  So that's how long we've been on this, folks.
[01:38:20.595 --> 01:38:32.105]  And I tell the story because I don't think people can actually realize the magnitude of when you open a door and a cop is choking a woman to make her sign her newborn baby over.
[01:38:33.506 --> 01:38:34.186]  For no reason.
[01:38:34.306 --> 01:38:36.208]  Because they were going to get hundreds of grand to adopt it.
[01:38:36.923 --> 01:38:42.188]  And to see the big fat, you know, giggly, and I'm not being mean to fat people, folks.
[01:38:42.228 --> 01:38:42.868]  I'm chubbing myself.
[01:38:42.909 --> 01:38:44.290]  I mean, it's just they're always the same.
[01:38:44.690 --> 01:38:58.663]  Demon people who smile and giggle, and a woman sobbing with incredible, I mean, the sound of it makes me, as a man who's pretty darn tough, just want to just rip people to pieces or cry or both, and you just see them, you actually see them drinking.
[01:38:59.043 --> 01:39:02.366]  You're actually, I mean, folks, it is, it's like nothing you've seen in a movie.
[01:39:02.606 --> 01:39:03.127]  They're, they're just,
[01:39:05.348 --> 01:39:05.988]  Oh, yes.
[01:39:06.689 --> 01:39:08.409]  It's like the Emperor or something.
[01:39:08.469 --> 01:39:09.530]  You want this.
[01:39:09.630 --> 01:39:10.070]  Yes.
[01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:13.512]  You mean fire at will, Commander.
[01:39:13.532 --> 01:39:15.833]  That's one thing I've seen that kind of looks like that.
[01:39:16.453 --> 01:39:18.214]  Mmm, I can taste the evil.
[01:39:19.875 --> 01:39:24.217]  I keep going back to that point because these people, folks, when we say they're evil, we're not just using that term.
[01:39:24.778 --> 01:39:25.998]  Rick, are they evil?
[01:39:26.058 --> 01:39:27.499]  Have you seen what I just described?
[01:39:28.408 --> 01:39:33.410]  Yes, I've seen the staff kick kids.
[01:39:33.690 --> 01:39:39.393]  When I go in there, I would see, my son would tell me the staff kicked him.
[01:39:40.023 --> 01:39:47.786]  For just, you know, threw him off the bed, ran his face on the floor, you know, just bruised him up.
[01:39:47.906 --> 01:39:48.426]  Choked him!
[01:39:48.846 --> 01:39:57.069]  I mean, there was a complete choke that he choked him and left a big ol' scar on his... See the color photos.
[01:39:57.089 --> 01:39:58.669]  Hold those up for people.
[01:39:59.170 --> 01:40:00.330]  You've also got some color ones.
[01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.770]  Yes.
[01:40:01.290 --> 01:40:07.052]  I mean, right here you can see the big ol' line that's, you know, and they say that's a restrain.
[01:40:07.232 --> 01:40:08.633]  That's not a restrain, that's a beam.
[01:40:09.594 --> 01:40:18.259]  You know, and I would, uh, he would tell me, Dad, now the female guards like to grab the, and this comes up over and over again, they like to grab the male generals and crush and then they smile.
[01:40:18.299 --> 01:40:26.623]  That's a, they would go in there with the gear with suited up with, with shields and everything, pepper spraying him while he's in restraints.
[01:40:27.316 --> 01:40:34.401]  I mean, this is, I mean, this is... Let's be clear, you're chained down and they're running around in black, black Darth Vader outfits beating you, yeah?
[01:40:34.881 --> 01:40:40.105]  Yeah, and he would tell me this and, you know, he would tell me that, you know, they... Hardcore criminals.
[01:40:40.425 --> 01:40:46.109]  And, but he, you know, the thing is that what they did to him, they put him in a corner and they would beat him, beat him, beat him, and guess what happened?
[01:40:46.129 --> 01:40:49.611]  When you put a dog in the corner, he'd come back out fighting.
[01:40:50.232 --> 01:40:53.074]  So he would take, you know, he would try to protect himself.
[01:40:53.832 --> 01:40:59.257]  Which is what they call, again I've seen so many squad car videos, where they're beating you with a belly club and you raise the arm.
[01:40:59.317 --> 01:41:00.538]  Boy, you get charged with assault.
[01:41:00.598 --> 01:41:01.159]  Yes you do.
[01:41:01.179 --> 01:41:04.602]  You gotta learn to just sit there and just go, this is America!
[01:41:05.062 --> 01:41:07.004]  Just knock your teeth out and go, thank you government!
[01:41:07.184 --> 01:41:07.845]  Thank you God!
[01:41:07.945 --> 01:41:08.265]  Thank you!
[01:41:08.285 --> 01:41:08.926]  You're my God!
[01:41:09.687 --> 01:41:10.988]  I just hate these people, man!
[01:41:11.028 --> 01:41:11.930]  Our country's gone!
[01:41:12.110 --> 01:41:14.633]  And let me tell all the yuppies and scum, they're going to take everything you've got, too.
[01:41:14.974 --> 01:41:16.335]  That's the only good part about this.
[01:41:16.596 --> 01:41:19.840]  All the people who think they're part of the system, uh-uh, you don't know what tyranny is yet.
[01:41:20.381 --> 01:41:23.024]  They've just been feeding on the poor people and minorities now.
[01:41:23.245 --> 01:41:24.206]  They're coming for everybody.
[01:41:25.316 --> 01:41:30.100]  You know, and the thing about it is that he was released under the Bill 1550 for mentally impaired offenders.
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:35.023]  His IQ was 48 by the Texas Youth Commission staff.
[01:41:35.604 --> 01:41:36.464]  They evaluated him.
[01:41:36.825 --> 01:41:42.329]  What happens is, MHMR, three weeks later, jumps his IQ to 71, and I said, no, no, no.
[01:41:42.349 --> 01:41:44.230]  And that's just all because they want to get the money.
[01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:47.292]  Now, now, now, I mean, your son's story is terrible.
[01:41:47.332 --> 01:41:48.493]  He's still in the system, correct?
[01:41:48.533 --> 01:41:48.934]  No, no, no.
[01:41:49.334 --> 01:41:49.754]  He's home.
[01:41:50.695 --> 01:41:52.556]  Okay, the last time I talked to you, he was in and out.
[01:41:52.656 --> 01:41:54.158]  I mean, how many times has he been in and out?
[01:41:55.296 --> 01:41:56.037]  Well, he got out in 2000.
[01:41:56.217 --> 01:41:57.437]  He was taken back 8 months later.
[01:41:57.517 --> 01:41:59.259]  And he was there 4 years, beaten every day.
[01:41:59.339 --> 01:42:01.420]  He was in security for 791 times.
[01:42:09.966 --> 01:42:16.068]  He was, uh, I mean, they just tortured him, pepper sprayed him, beat him up, used the other kids to beat him up.
[01:42:16.429 --> 01:42:17.069]  He would fight.
[01:42:17.449 --> 01:42:20.090]  Now, now, now, you're suing right now.
[01:42:20.130 --> 01:42:23.912]  Tell us about that, but then tell us what it's like to be in it, because I've been in the courtroom with Jean Meir.
[01:42:23.972 --> 01:42:27.433]  Folks, she literally could get Academy Awards for playing villains.
[01:42:27.493 --> 01:42:34.556]  I mean, the eyes glistening, sparkling with hatred, you know, the smiling, the screaming, sign that document or you're going to jail.
[01:42:34.656 --> 01:42:37.818]  Yes, well, she told me that I was going to blow up the Gardner beds, and I said no.
[01:42:37.838 --> 01:42:39.520]  And then she told my wife to divorce me.
[01:43:01.699 --> 01:43:10.144]  No, I mean, I've been in the courtroom and imagine this woman with the butch haircut and the eyes bulging out standing there and there's families walk up and they go, hello ma'am, we're very sorry.
[01:43:10.164 --> 01:43:14.366]  And your child didn't go to school two days in a row.
[01:43:14.766 --> 01:43:15.587]  Yes, I know.
[01:43:16.567 --> 01:43:20.569]  And by the way, folks, the state law is 14 unexcused absences in a semester.
[01:43:20.769 --> 01:43:21.650]  There's not even a law.
[01:43:22.150 --> 01:43:26.312]  And then she goes, well, I'm telling you right now, he violated his probation.
[01:43:26.653 --> 01:43:30.675]  And the kid was on probation because they had him sign on to probation.
[01:43:31.463 --> 01:43:32.924]  For being late to class three times.
[01:43:33.385 --> 01:43:37.269]  So see, and then she slams it down and she goes six months in the detention center.
[01:43:37.629 --> 01:43:38.750]  Boom, kid's gone forever.
[01:43:39.511 --> 01:43:44.275]  Five years later, the child's been raped hundreds of times, beaten, doesn't have their front teeth.
[01:43:44.575 --> 01:43:46.337]  This is the story we've seen over and over again.
[01:43:46.497 --> 01:43:48.899]  Well, the guard in the beds, he got beat up by the staff.
[01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:50.361]  And he got a big ol' cut.
[01:43:50.701 --> 01:43:52.062]  And he went in front of Judge Merriman.
[01:43:52.082 --> 01:43:53.784]  Judge Merriman said nothing was wrong with him.
[01:43:54.384 --> 01:43:56.366]  And took him away for two weeks.
[01:43:56.426 --> 01:43:57.087]  I couldn't see him.
[01:43:58.004 --> 01:44:01.805]  And I filed a complaint, and it went all the way up to T.Y.C.'
[01:44:01.765 --> 01:44:03.786]  's office, and they didn't do nothing.
[01:44:04.306 --> 01:44:23.553]  They just turned around and put it under the... Now again, over the child courts, like you walk into a normal courtroom, and most judges are pretty friendly, and it's a normal thing, but then you walk into the child courts, the family courts, and folks all over, and I've been at them all over the state, it's literally, you're entering a nest of evil.
[01:44:23.573 --> 01:44:25.514]  And again, these aren't real courts.
[01:44:26.582 --> 01:44:39.800]  Oh yes, well he was sent to the Texas Youth Commission, he goes to Crockett, he gets beat up by staff, gets beat up by the kids there, learns to handle himself, comes out
[01:44:40.507 --> 01:44:46.908]  Eight months later, goes to school, gets assaulted by a staff, 250 pounds, and he's only 88 pounds.
[01:44:47.288 --> 01:44:49.189]  He's assaulted a staff.
[01:44:49.529 --> 01:44:50.869]  Turns around, goes to Judge Meir.
[01:44:51.129 --> 01:44:55.690]  Judge Meir turns around, sends him back to TYC, knowing that he couldn't do the program.
[01:44:56.010 --> 01:44:58.270]  But now they're saying, yes, he can do the program.
[01:44:59.190 --> 01:45:04.171]  And so then I did what they call a due process with Texas Education Agency.
[01:45:04.611 --> 01:45:07.632]  They evaluated him with an IQ of 44.
[01:45:09.344 --> 01:45:10.965]  Now look at the 44 and 48.
[01:45:11.245 --> 01:45:14.267]  That's 5 points or 4 points up or 4 points down.
[01:45:14.927 --> 01:45:20.870]  But MHMR, 23 points just to not give him services?
[01:45:22.391 --> 01:45:23.591]  You know, that was wrong.
[01:45:23.751 --> 01:45:26.173]  But I mean, your case goes on and on.
[01:45:27.691 --> 01:45:34.937]  Rick, you keep, and I've talked to so many parents like you, you keep going, I just don't know, they just don't follow the rules, they're just not, and you keep bringing up procedure to them.
[01:45:35.517 --> 01:45:38.179]  And let me just tell you from my own experience, they don't care.
[01:45:38.559 --> 01:45:39.120]  The system...
[01:45:39.841 --> 01:45:41.803]  The system is about pacifying you.
[01:45:41.863 --> 01:45:43.184]  It's about neutralizing you.
[01:45:43.244 --> 01:45:45.045]  It's about getting you to even work in their system.
[01:45:45.385 --> 01:45:47.527]  The system is totally and completely bankrupt.
[01:45:48.488 --> 01:45:51.910]  Thousands of criminals and felons working just in the youth system.
[01:45:53.932 --> 01:45:57.635]  At every major facility, the reports of the guards raping the children publicly.
[01:45:57.655 --> 01:46:01.478]  You know, gladiator nights where they give them weapons and they fight.
[01:46:01.538 --> 01:46:03.159]  I mean, that came out in testimony yesterday.
[01:46:04.119 --> 01:46:08.582]  I mean, this, and they call themselves the Untouchables, it's these weird good old boy networks.
[01:46:08.662 --> 01:46:11.303]  I mean, it all needs to be abolished.
[01:46:11.343 --> 01:46:16.326]  We didn't have all these problems back when we had, everybody knows orphanages throughout history have been nightmares.
[01:46:16.906 --> 01:46:18.247]  And that's where the abusers go.
[01:46:18.287 --> 01:46:19.587]  We look at the orphanages in Russia.
[01:46:19.928 --> 01:46:21.749]  It just has to, it all has to be abolished.
[01:46:21.789 --> 01:46:22.429]  It's an industry.
[01:46:22.809 --> 01:46:25.331]  Well, we serve juvenile crime, juvenile crime, juvenile crime.
[01:46:25.551 --> 01:46:27.232]  Gang-related, gang-related.
[01:46:27.252 --> 01:46:28.352]  Well, they make gangs.
[01:46:28.412 --> 01:46:31.694]  They make the kids to become gang members in TYC.
[01:46:31.714 --> 01:46:32.175]  Well, that's it.
[01:46:32.215 --> 01:46:42.260]  They're Indians, because you've got the big gang leader who's 18 and buddies with the staff, and he gets to rape whoever he wants, and they're taught, and it's sick.
[01:46:42.441 --> 01:46:43.281]  It's a factory.
[01:46:43.441 --> 01:46:47.243]  And the thing about it, the way that Jean Merritt said, she was watching us.
[01:46:48.866 --> 01:46:53.549]  Because, uh, in Crockett in 2000, uh, DEA did an audit.
[01:46:53.710 --> 01:46:57.272]  Audit Crockett and found out that eight kids did not belong there.
[01:46:57.672 --> 01:46:59.454]  They had to be released immediately.
[01:47:00.454 --> 01:47:02.516]  They were... One of them was Ricky, my son.
[01:47:02.536 --> 01:47:02.956]  Yeah.
[01:47:03.356 --> 01:47:14.644]  So, what happened is, to me, it was a retaliation back into the system that beat the dog out of him until the day he got out, uh, April the... April the 5th was the last incident that he had.
[01:47:15.125 --> 01:47:16.165]  He got out April the 8th, 2005.
[01:47:20.028 --> 01:47:23.510]  My son was in solitary confinement.
[01:47:23.971 --> 01:47:24.651]  Suicidal.
[01:47:25.131 --> 01:47:26.912]  I mean he wanted to take his life away.
[01:47:27.413 --> 01:47:29.254]  And nobody would tell me nothing.
[01:47:29.294 --> 01:47:29.734]  No staff.
[01:47:29.954 --> 01:47:32.236]  But they were scared when I would go up there to visit him.
[01:47:32.536 --> 01:47:33.537]  Mr. Luna, how you doing?
[01:47:33.777 --> 01:47:34.417]  They all knew me.
[01:47:34.477 --> 01:47:35.738]  I didn't know none of these staff.
[01:47:35.978 --> 01:47:36.799]  But they all knew me.
[01:47:37.039 --> 01:47:43.323]  Because they knew that I was determined to see my son get the right treatment.
[01:47:43.443 --> 01:47:45.184]  Not to be beaten up like a dog.
[01:47:45.945 --> 01:47:46.926]  And that's very wrong.
[01:47:47.326 --> 01:47:51.768]  And Steve Robinson, before Dwight Harris, knew everything about this.
[01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:53.269]  So he just resigned.
[01:47:53.890 --> 01:47:55.150]  I mean, he retired.
[01:47:56.571 --> 01:47:59.173]  He got out before the fire started, you know.
[01:47:59.693 --> 01:48:05.156]  And Dwight Harris knew everything of my son, but he still said he can do the program.
[01:48:05.971 --> 01:48:10.554]  Knowing he was discharged, he signed the paper to be discharged under the Bill 1550.
[01:48:10.614 --> 01:48:22.761]  So it's just, it's just what it is, is they train them to go to prison to become, you know, to become, you know, prison, you know.
[01:48:23.402 --> 01:48:25.883]  And now they're shifting over to the schools that way.
[01:48:26.243 --> 01:48:30.286]  Well the schools, the schools start, wherever they start, the school starts
[01:48:31.204 --> 01:48:32.265]  Send them to Gardner Betts.
[01:48:32.765 --> 01:48:34.546]  Gardner Betts sends them to GYC.
[01:48:35.127 --> 01:48:37.188]  GYC sends them to prison.
[01:48:37.348 --> 01:48:38.009]  Now let's be clear.
[01:48:38.049 --> 01:48:39.290]  Let me explain how this works.
[01:48:39.330 --> 01:48:41.471]  Coast to coast, it's being implemented with the federal grants.
[01:48:42.292 --> 01:48:45.935]  If you're late to class three times now, they call that an unexcused absence.
[01:48:47.135 --> 01:48:49.657]  Then they call your parents up who don't know their rights.
[01:48:50.138 --> 01:48:50.378]  Okay?
[01:48:50.418 --> 01:48:56.942]  And folks, when I was in high school, this happened to me before I just totally got straight arrow and went to every class and made 100s.
[01:48:57.583 --> 01:48:59.144]  Because I figured it out and said, wait a minute.
[01:49:00.187 --> 01:49:02.288]  Because I saw the system getting my friends in jail.
[01:49:02.348 --> 01:49:03.449]  I saw the things happening.
[01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:05.389]  But this is how it works.
[01:49:05.409 --> 01:49:05.950]  It's real simple.
[01:49:06.850 --> 01:49:07.871]  You're late to class three times.
[01:49:07.891 --> 01:49:09.251]  That's called an absence.
[01:49:09.451 --> 01:49:11.052]  Those combine to make a one-day absence.
[01:49:11.432 --> 01:49:12.753]  Then they call you before a judge.
[01:49:12.773 --> 01:49:15.354]  They build portable buildings in every major school district around the country.
[01:49:16.074 --> 01:49:17.054]  The judges come in.
[01:49:17.455 --> 01:49:18.395]  It's not a real court.
[01:49:18.975 --> 01:49:21.957]  And they just tell the parents, here, sign this form and your child won't get in trouble.
[01:49:22.457 --> 01:49:24.898]  The form says that they're now on probation.
[01:49:25.658 --> 01:49:27.119]  Even six months
[01:49:28.328 --> 01:49:39.151]  Even six months they get in trouble, then they go to the special disciplinary school, which is a prison, and then if they do anything there, which they all do, boom, to real prison.
[01:49:39.672 --> 01:49:48.694]  And they spend an average of five and a half years, according to the Dallas Morning News, and 93% of them have their sentences extended and extended and extended.
[01:49:49.435 --> 01:49:53.856]  And it's simple, it's cold-blooded, and they're a bunch of pedophiles and rapists and people that like to flirt.
[01:49:56.687 --> 01:49:59.849]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.189 --> 01:50:02.150]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.511 --> 01:50:10.175]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.855 --> 01:50:17.900]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:25.264]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:25.675 --> 01:50:29.717]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.017 --> 01:50:33.538]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.978 --> 01:50:35.919]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.239 --> 01:50:40.240]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:53:43.303 --> 01:53:44.043]  Get it out to everybody.
[01:53:44.924 --> 01:53:45.404]  Rick Luna.
[01:53:45.705 --> 01:53:50.428]  Rick, I'm just sorry that I and others haven't done enough to help your son and he had to continue to go through all this.
[01:53:52.217 --> 01:53:56.819]  But now you're fighting for the other children and young people that are in this system.
[01:53:57.460 --> 01:54:13.026]  Hearing now the Texas Rangers investigation was blocked for two years and that it was at every facility raping and in sex parties with the kids and now it's coming out we did find it mainstream news by the way it is confirmed that some of them were prostituting children out and the government
[01:54:14.239 --> 01:54:15.681]  The U.S.
[01:54:15.721 --> 01:54:23.087]  Prosecutor, this is Ronette Daly, folks, wrote a letter that's public saying, well, maybe it doesn't hurt the kids, maybe it's consensual.
[01:54:23.167 --> 01:54:25.850]  That's rape, period, and we know it's not consensual.
[01:54:26.050 --> 01:54:27.071]  They have power over them.
[01:54:27.751 --> 01:54:40.643]  And I heard there was a committee chairman or one of the other House members yesterday in the hearing, Rick, was saying, was kind of being sarcastic to some of the mothers going, well, would it be better if the prison was closer?
[01:54:42.546 --> 01:54:50.924]  They need to take away TYC's home-based groups for parents and kids that can work with them.
[01:54:52.068 --> 01:54:59.414]  Well, if a child commits criminal acts, then they can be put into a system, but not break a window out.
[01:54:59.454 --> 01:55:01.156]  I mean, it needs to be stealing cars.
[01:55:01.576 --> 01:55:06.140]  I mean, if there was a fight, if a kid assaulted somebody with a deadly weapon, they need to go to jail for it.
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:12.465]  But, I mean, the stuff I did as a youth, I mean, I would have been literally, folks, in the deepest, darkest dungeon.
[01:55:13.399 --> 01:55:18.946]  Well, the thing, yes, well see the thing is that any little thing that they're doing now, it's a money making thing.
[01:55:19.026 --> 01:55:19.787]  It's like cattle.
[01:55:19.827 --> 01:55:21.989]  They, you know, more cattle, more money.
[01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:23.511]  More kids, more money.
[01:55:23.711 --> 01:55:25.994]  Jean Miller needs to fill, guard their beds.
[01:55:26.054 --> 01:55:30.980]  If she don't fill that building up, federal money will not get, she won't get no federal money.
[01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:34.505]  Well, that's why they built a building after her when she'd only been in office a few years.
[01:55:34.525 --> 01:55:37.029]  Imagine, she gets elected and they build a gigantic facility.
[01:55:37.309 --> 01:55:38.130]  I mean, it's huge.
[01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:40.253]  It looks like the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness.
[01:55:40.834 --> 01:55:43.618]  And she literally did it because she's so evil.
[01:55:44.199 --> 01:55:46.603]  It's, it's, Gardner and Betts is the same thing as TYC.
[01:55:47.541 --> 01:55:48.041]  It's the same.
[01:55:48.101 --> 01:55:53.683]  They're doing the same thing as they're doing at TYC, but they're being exposed right now at TYC.
[01:55:53.723 --> 01:55:55.744]  Now, for those who don't know what Gardner Betts is, tell them.
[01:55:56.144 --> 01:56:03.446]  Gardner Betts is a juvenile facility for kids here in Austin that miss school.
[01:56:03.726 --> 01:56:05.967]  They go there and they get beat up by the staff.
[01:56:05.987 --> 01:56:07.508]  They get beat up by other kids.
[01:56:07.868 --> 01:56:08.668]  Now, let's be clear though.
[01:56:09.148 --> 01:56:29.699]  Because, remember the ASAP program back in 2000, back in 1999, where they would send police by the end of the day, even if you'd called, that wasn't good enough, and they would bang on the door and demand to come in, and of course, most of those types that were doing that were the pedophile type, and we had all those reports, and we went and got the state law and went to the county commissioners and said,
[01:56:30.905 --> 01:56:33.169]  The criminal absence is 14.
[01:56:33.649 --> 01:56:39.037]  You're going to people's houses claiming crimes before the school day ended for one absence.
[01:56:39.418 --> 01:56:45.127]  Spotlight program was done by our Governor Rick Perry.
[01:56:45.692 --> 01:56:52.638]  They would go into our house, they would go into his room, and they would see, you know, and they'd just come and burst into our home.
[01:56:52.718 --> 01:57:08.713]  But I want to be clear, in England and in some states of the U.S., they're starting a thing at three years old where the quote social worker comes by to examine your child's development, in England it's even two year olds, toddlers, and then they quote assess them for the propensity to commit crime off some quack test.
[01:57:09.153 --> 01:57:12.475]  And then I have another report here where innocent Americans are put in anti-terror databases.
[01:57:12.675 --> 01:57:16.757]  When you buy a car, get a home loan, you're being put through anti-terror databases.
[01:57:16.777 --> 01:57:17.657]  You're being denied.
[01:57:18.037 --> 01:57:20.258]  Now you're going to have to use a driver's license to buy and sell.
[01:57:20.499 --> 01:57:21.639]  They're getting us all ready.
[01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:23.260]  Stay there, Rick.
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:25.021]  We're going to come back in just 70 seconds.
[01:57:25.381 --> 01:57:26.602]  And I want to break that down.
[01:57:26.722 --> 01:57:28.182]  What life's going to be like for everybody.
[01:57:28.422 --> 01:57:30.463]  They go after the weak first, the women and children.
[01:57:30.623 --> 01:57:31.544]  But this is for everybody.
[01:57:33.422 --> 01:57:38.023]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.043 --> 01:57:38.243]  Hello!
[01:57:38.283 --> 01:57:38.803]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.823 --> 01:57:39.524]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.564 --> 01:57:40.664]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:40.684 --> 01:57:42.704]  You want answers?
[01:57:43.585 --> 01:57:45.945]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.615 --> 01:58:01.276]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.756 --> 01:58:05.897]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.718 --> 01:58:09.138]  It is Wednesday, the 29th day of March 2007.
[01:58:09.178 --> 01:58:21.762]  Massive 9-11 news breaking, huge news on Iran, a bunch of other reports, but we've got Rick Luna in here, who 5-6 years ago we protested with, interviewed, went down to his court cases.
[01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:25.911]  With him beating and torturing and sexually abusing his son.
[01:58:25.951 --> 01:58:27.292]  It went on for year after year.
[01:58:27.392 --> 01:58:29.293]  All of this started from pushing a hall monitor.
[01:58:29.733 --> 01:58:42.260]  And they had testimony at the Texas Legislature yesterday about, we're talking 11 year old children who a window would get busted out and then they would end up sending all four of them to jail and one of them would spend six years in there.
[01:58:42.741 --> 01:58:45.842]  And then they hop them up on drugs because they get more federal funds off that.
[01:58:46.223 --> 01:58:48.224]  Then they put them on Prozac, Ritalin.
[01:58:49.776 --> 01:58:50.617]  It's so hellish.
[01:58:50.637 --> 01:58:52.338]  But understand, this is not just about Texas.
[01:58:52.378 --> 01:58:54.600]  If you're in Illinois, New York, California, Florida.
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:57.422]  In Florida, there's 3,000 plus just missing children.
[01:58:58.283 --> 01:59:00.264]  And that's not even a major national news story.
[01:59:00.284 --> 01:59:01.665]  The government grabs children.
[01:59:01.825 --> 01:59:02.746]  They're gone!
[01:59:04.167 --> 01:59:05.768]  And believe me, it can get that bad here.
[01:59:06.208 --> 01:59:10.091]  It's just Florida is so corrupt that I guess the folks are better in Texas.
[01:59:10.111 --> 01:59:10.892]  We've been fighting back.
[01:59:11.192 --> 01:59:12.974]  Believe me, it's not just happening in Texas.
[01:59:13.014 --> 01:59:14.114]  It's happening in your state.
[01:59:14.335 --> 01:59:17.397]  This is the same federally designed system everywhere, Rick.
[01:59:18.047 --> 01:59:27.047]  Yes, well, to clear that up, the women would come to, the women's staff would play with my son, you know.
[01:59:29.399 --> 01:59:34.603]  That's horrible abuse folks!
[01:59:35.003 --> 01:59:43.509]  And the thing about these staffs, they would all come to me, oh your son is so handsome, you know, and it was just like, you know, why are they telling me this, you know?
[01:59:43.549 --> 01:59:44.250]  Really sick.
[01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:57.479]  Yeah, really, you know, and my son, well, you know, he was, hey, the woman comes to him, 13 years old, you know, he thinks, you know, he doesn't think too much, you know, he's 13 years old, but really, he's
[01:59:58.291 --> 01:59:58.491]  I think so.
[02:00:12.876 --> 02:00:15.617]  I certainly wouldn't want to talk to my dad about that.
[02:00:33.729 --> 02:00:34.250]  No, I know.
[02:00:34.590 --> 02:00:38.795]  Look, it's insane power trips for these people that would never be anybody.
[02:00:39.275 --> 02:00:41.197]  Just white trash scum or other scum.
[02:00:41.498 --> 02:00:43.780]  And they go get these jobs and they get to be lords.
[02:00:44.261 --> 02:00:47.704]  I mean, that's how it was described in testimony yesterday, is they call themselves the Untouchables.
[02:00:48.145 --> 02:00:48.946]  And it's like a kingdom.
[02:00:48.966 --> 02:00:51.028]  You get to go rule over a bunch of poor children.
[02:00:51.228 --> 02:00:53.691]  I heard TYC had a ranch and had an airplane.
[02:00:54.935 --> 02:00:58.038]  You better believe they've got an airplane.
[02:00:58.078 --> 02:00:59.580]  That's what this is all about.
[02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:02.062]  You ought to see what they do to the little kids.
[02:01:02.783 --> 02:01:07.668]  Here I am bringing this to the attention of everyone, and all they did was put it under the rug.
[02:01:08.449 --> 02:01:09.129]  But I'm glad.
[02:01:09.309 --> 02:01:13.113]  I'm glad that the Dallas Daily... Why not Austin?
[02:01:13.714 --> 02:01:14.475]  Why not Austin?
[02:01:14.595 --> 02:01:16.677]  Because do they have a contract with the state?
[02:01:17.515 --> 02:01:19.956]  The statesman's been writing whitewashers.
[02:01:20.577 --> 02:01:31.362]  They'll report on how people got arrested because they were falsifying reports to keep kids in prison, but they won't talk about the very same facility had all night sex rape parties with people paying money to come to them.
[02:01:32.722 --> 02:01:33.783]  Well, these places are bad.
[02:01:33.823 --> 02:01:39.546]  San Seba and Security, as a matter of fact, they have a room that was so cold, it was room 158.
[02:01:40.046 --> 02:01:45.788]  They put kids in there and it's so cold that they would put my son in there.
[02:01:45.808 --> 02:01:46.729]  Now he has asthma.
[02:01:47.890 --> 02:01:53.914]  You know, and then what Advocacy did, they were not giving them one hour of rec.
[02:01:55.235 --> 02:01:59.998]  They were not, San Seba was not giving these kids one hour of rec for being in security.
[02:02:00.558 --> 02:02:01.499]  That's the state law.
[02:02:01.519 --> 02:02:03.180]  They have to give them one hour of rec.
[02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:09.164]  What happened is Advocacy, Rick Navarro, the attorney there, wrote him a letter.
[02:02:10.124 --> 02:02:12.866]  Next day, they were giving these kids an hour of rec.
[02:02:13.775 --> 02:02:19.258]  You know, and there was, these kids were, you know, they wanted to commit crimes to get away from these people.
[02:02:19.819 --> 02:02:21.780]  That's how bad these people were treating them.
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:23.121]  Well, they're the criminals.
[02:02:23.381 --> 02:02:25.702]  Listen, there is no government, there is no authority.
[02:02:26.042 --> 02:02:27.203]  It's all totally criminal.
[02:02:27.503 --> 02:02:30.425]  The worst people you're going to find in society are in government.
[02:02:30.705 --> 02:02:31.285]  Period.
[02:02:31.726 --> 02:02:32.786]  The country's bankrupt.
[02:02:33.427 --> 02:02:34.667]  Terrorists run the nation.
[02:02:34.707 --> 02:02:35.868]  They carried out 9-11.
[02:02:36.228 --> 02:02:37.949]  They put their criminals in place everywhere.
[02:02:38.049 --> 02:02:40.711]  Final segment with Rick Luna straight ahead.
[02:02:40.731 --> 02:02:41.692]  Then we'll get into 9-11.
[02:02:48.562 --> 02:02:49.023]  It's here.
[02:02:49.243 --> 02:02:54.009]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.389 --> 02:03:02.039]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.719 --> 02:03:09.782]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.182 --> 02:03:21.607]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.907 --> 02:03:25.529]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.829 --> 02:03:27.810]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.130 --> 02:03:31.992]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:46.192 --> 02:03:55.261]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.501 --> 02:04:06.751]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:07.071 --> 02:04:11.896]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[02:04:12.116 --> 02:04:12.316]  I think?
[02:04:30.947 --> 02:04:32.769]  Let's get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[02:04:32.809 --> 02:04:33.670]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:33.710 --> 02:04:34.050]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:34.070 --> 02:04:35.451]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:04:45.825 --> 02:04:48.246]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:04:48.747 --> 02:04:52.068]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[02:04:52.449 --> 02:04:55.390]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[02:04:55.670 --> 02:05:02.034]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[02:05:02.114 --> 02:05:06.516]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[02:05:06.756 --> 02:05:11.118]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[02:05:11.279 --> 02:05:13.880]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[02:05:13.900 --> 02:05:16.661]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[02:05:17.142 --> 02:05:19.663]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[02:05:19.723 --> 02:05:23.965]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[02:05:24.025 --> 02:05:24.866]  Treasury bonds.
[02:05:25.146 --> 02:05:29.771]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[02:05:29.951 --> 02:05:31.592]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:31.612 --> 02:05:33.594]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:50.104]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.464 --> 02:05:52.786]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:53.867 --> 02:05:55.888]  Huge developments on the 9-11 front.
[02:05:56.189 --> 02:05:59.211]  The Rosie O'Donnell clip coming up here in about 5 minutes.
[02:05:59.932 --> 02:06:03.735]  And then I've got to just condense and run through news in the last 20 minutes or so.
[02:06:03.755 --> 02:06:05.156]  We're not going to take any calls today.
[02:06:05.556 --> 02:06:06.917]  Tomorrow we'll have wide open phones.
[02:06:06.937 --> 02:06:09.599]  We've got several guests coming on, but we will have open phones.
[02:06:09.639 --> 02:06:10.560]  I promise you that.
[02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:12.581]  But huge developments for 9-11 Truth.
[02:06:13.722 --> 02:06:15.483]  I mean, we should be celebrating about this.
[02:06:15.503 --> 02:06:17.204]  We've got to make sure the word gets out on it.
[02:06:18.545 --> 02:06:22.447]  Mick Luna, it is so great that your son is out of this death camp.
[02:06:23.068 --> 02:06:25.909]  But there are tens of thousands of other children in the system.
[02:06:26.429 --> 02:06:28.231]  Millions nationwide.
[02:06:28.871 --> 02:06:31.392]  Over a million children are taken each year by CPS.
[02:06:31.412 --> 02:06:35.815]  We're talking about children 10 to 18 in the juvenile justice system.
[02:06:36.756 --> 02:06:42.944]  The IRS, the Internal Revenue Service, the Patriot Act, the juvenile justice system.
[02:06:43.184 --> 02:06:47.929]  It's not about justice, it's about a wicked group of scumbags that have made a business out of this.
[02:06:48.804 --> 02:06:49.905]  And they're not stopping.
[02:06:50.265 --> 02:06:52.425]  The schools are being instructed to be present.
[02:06:53.066 --> 02:06:55.487]  Rick, show some more of those photos to the camera.
[02:06:55.807 --> 02:06:56.987]  Make any other points you've got.
[02:06:57.407 --> 02:07:02.589]  It sounds like a secondary issue, but you make the point they're actually given no education while they're in there, while they claim they do.
[02:07:02.809 --> 02:07:07.011]  The bottom line is the worst place children could be is in the state system.
[02:07:07.511 --> 02:07:07.851]  Okay?
[02:07:07.871 --> 02:07:09.472]  And they're not there to protect society.
[02:07:09.512 --> 02:07:12.733]  These are engines to create gangbangers and criminals.
[02:07:13.233 --> 02:07:14.134]  It's just disgusting.
[02:07:14.694 --> 02:07:14.854]  Rick?
[02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:16.050]  Well, yes.
[02:07:16.491 --> 02:07:18.932]  TYC did not educate my son.
[02:07:19.012 --> 02:07:20.733]  He does not have a GED.
[02:07:21.954 --> 02:07:28.819]  They falsified documents saying he was a 9th grade, when he was no 3rd grade reader.
[02:07:29.419 --> 02:07:31.620]  And he's trying to educate himself right now.
[02:07:32.201 --> 02:07:36.944]  And by himself, you know, and he's trying to do things that, you know, he's trying to get a job.
[02:07:37.464 --> 02:07:41.187]  It's just so hard for him because these people, they destroyed him.
[02:07:41.687 --> 02:07:42.527]  They didn't help him.
[02:07:42.668 --> 02:07:44.809]  There was no rehabilitation for him.
[02:07:45.481 --> 02:07:47.502]  What about Ginger Galloway?
[02:07:47.542 --> 02:07:55.287]  She had some problem in her family with her young teenage son and instead of handling it herself, I'm not trying to be mean to her, but she was still defending it.
[02:07:55.647 --> 02:08:00.530]  Hey lady, now he bleeds all over the place and now he's not going to be helped.
[02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:04.473]  You have to understand, the government is criminal.
[02:08:04.513 --> 02:08:06.154]  They will not, they cannot help you.
[02:08:06.969 --> 02:08:19.279]  And I feel sorry for Ginger, but I'm glad she spoke out, because even though her son was being beat up and raped, you know, she had to stand up and... No, I mean, I commend her.
[02:08:19.379 --> 02:08:22.922]  It's just that you never turn your family in.
[02:08:22.942 --> 02:08:23.642]  It's a belief.
[02:08:23.903 --> 02:08:35.372]  Well, you certainly never turn your children in, and I mean, if you've got some husband that's threatening to kill you, you know, I mean, it'd be better for... I'm not telling you to kill people, folks, but it'd be better to handle it yourself than call the system in, because they're not going to help you.
[02:08:35.852 --> 02:08:39.754]  Now, I mean, there are still good cops for robberies and cops for when something happens.
[02:08:40.114 --> 02:08:41.675]  But more and more, I don't even see that.
[02:08:42.035 --> 02:08:45.516]  I mean, I've called cops before and they start asking me about myself when they show up.
[02:08:46.056 --> 02:08:47.677]  I mean, folks, this country is gone.
[02:08:47.717 --> 02:08:49.378]  This ain't the way it used to be anymore.
[02:08:49.718 --> 02:08:50.198]  That's true.
[02:08:50.698 --> 02:08:54.080]  You know, she should have called the cops because look what happened.
[02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:57.101]  She called the cops thinking she's going to get help.
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:08:58.500]  I don't
[02:09:15.572 --> 02:09:17.173]  Squeeze the teacher's stomach.
[02:09:17.534 --> 02:09:18.855]  That's what little kids do.
[02:09:18.975 --> 02:09:24.339]  I mean, frankly, my children run up and squeeze my stomach or hug on me or jump on me.
[02:09:24.379 --> 02:09:25.559]  I mean, that's what they do.
[02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:29.262]  I mean, if you go buy a puppy that's six weeks old, it's going to do that.
[02:09:29.642 --> 02:09:31.624]  I mean, we're mammals, man.
[02:09:31.904 --> 02:09:34.246]  They take normal behavior and they make it evil.
[02:09:34.526 --> 02:09:37.648]  I mean, folks, this country's gone.
[02:09:38.029 --> 02:09:43.773]  I mean, folks, they take kids every day who get caught at school when they're six, seven, playing doctor, okay?
[02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:56.614]  Yeah, I filed a federal lawsuit in 2002 and the judge just threw it out of court, didn't say he was not meant to retard it.
[02:09:58.715 --> 02:10:09.959]  So I went back about three weeks ago and I filed it again because they're telling the statute of limitations and now the court's telling me that I need to get a lawyer in 60 days.
[02:10:11.534 --> 02:10:15.437]  They should appoint a lawyer because he's a child with disability.
[02:10:15.557 --> 02:10:19.079]  Here's the problem, they'll appoint one of their people and they'll just drop the ball on purpose, probably.
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:23.582]  They probably would do that, but I'd still fight them, because it's legal.
[02:10:23.602 --> 02:10:27.684]  Look, if you want to get these people, you start surveilling them personally.
[02:10:27.724 --> 02:10:30.166]  I've said this over and over again, I can't do it all, folks.
[02:10:30.706 --> 02:10:40.372]  If people want to expose them, you don't do anything illegal, you just get public places, you start surveilling, you start photographing, you start following these judges and people, and folks,
[02:10:41.741 --> 02:10:47.426]  Individuals that can put tens of thousands of innocent people into rape rooms, they're always going to be involved in crime.
[02:10:47.827 --> 02:10:49.608]  They're always going to be involved in sick stuff.
[02:10:50.109 --> 02:10:51.950]  And folks, you just go put it up on the web.
[02:10:52.251 --> 02:10:55.513]  They want to play hardball, I'm telling you how to bring them down, America.
[02:10:56.114 --> 02:11:00.318]  Yeah, the lawyers from DYC, they all need to go.
[02:11:00.965 --> 02:11:01.726]  They all need to go.
[02:11:01.766 --> 02:11:03.367]  They gave us so much hard time.
[02:11:03.808 --> 02:11:04.949]  They were so arrogant.
[02:11:05.309 --> 02:11:06.430]  They all need to go to prison.
[02:11:06.570 --> 02:11:06.790]  Yes.
[02:11:07.111 --> 02:11:07.991]  Yeah.
[02:11:08.011 --> 02:11:15.698]  Listen, you start arresting these people and you start throwing them in with the 25 and 30 and 40 year olds that were raped by them 10, 20 years ago.
[02:11:16.039 --> 02:11:16.859]  See how they like it.
[02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:18.201]  You're right, Alex.
[02:11:18.761 --> 02:11:20.483]  You know, and these people need to be punished.
[02:11:20.743 --> 02:11:34.073]  They need not to be slapped in the head, and resign, and knowing they're going to get a little pension, and then, you know... You know, I always wondered why in prisons, why they always kill the child molesters, because obviously the child molesters are scum, but why do prisons hate them so much?
[02:11:34.333 --> 02:11:44.521]  Because most of the people in prisons were raped by those type of people, and they know what they look like, they know what they act like, and that's why once a child molester goes to prison, they usually get killed like Jeffrey Dahmer did.
[02:11:44.822 --> 02:11:44.982]  Yes.
[02:11:45.502 --> 02:11:48.224]  So, we need to put them all in general population.
[02:11:48.444 --> 02:11:48.724]  Right.
[02:11:49.144 --> 02:11:50.085]  I agree with you, Alex.
[02:11:51.846 --> 02:12:02.052]  Well, I tell you, any contact info, your organization, who you're suing, how people help you, how families can get involved, how you guys can rally together.
[02:12:02.392 --> 02:12:09.137]  Yes, I have a home phone number, plus I got a cell number, and I can give it to you if
[02:12:10.277 --> 02:12:12.719]  Because, I mean, like it or not, Rick, you've become a leader.
[02:12:12.739 --> 02:12:16.201]  You're leading marches and demonstrations and going and testifying.
[02:12:16.241 --> 02:12:20.244]  I mean, how do folks, you know, join up with you or support you?
[02:12:20.464 --> 02:12:28.369]  Well, we're doing the Chesa Chavez march, and we're going to march for the kids that are still in TYC.
[02:12:28.389 --> 02:12:28.990]  Let them go!
[02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.670]  Let them go!
[02:12:32.512 --> 02:12:32.732]  No.
[02:12:32.832 --> 02:12:33.933]  That's what I said yesterday.
[02:12:34.373 --> 02:12:40.335]  Instead of having these marches where we go out and just say, Texas Independence Day, or we go out and we say, you know, D.C.
[02:12:40.355 --> 02:12:44.276]  State, or we go out and we just have these marches for no reason and wave flags and do this.
[02:12:44.516 --> 02:12:49.038]  I mean, we need to see the communities out there on real issues.
[02:12:49.358 --> 02:12:49.538]  Yes.
[02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:57.663]  And I'm hoping a lot of people will join us and bring signs that TYC no more, TYC no more.
[02:12:57.683 --> 02:12:59.643]  When is that going to be?
[02:12:59.663 --> 02:13:04.265]  This is Cesar Chavez March, Saturday.
[02:13:06.446 --> 02:13:08.567]  Probably next Saturday.
[02:13:09.987 --> 02:13:11.008]  Sometime around there.
[02:13:11.848 --> 02:13:13.569]  If you want to get a hold of me, my number is 905.
[02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:17.732]  2026.
[02:13:15.810 --> 02:13:17.732]  That's 5-1-2?
[02:13:17.912 --> 02:13:19.433]  Correct.
[02:13:19.453 --> 02:13:19.493]  5-1-2?
[02:13:20.494 --> 02:13:21.855]  Yeah.
[02:13:21.875 --> 02:13:22.175]  9-0-5, 2026.
[02:13:22.816 --> 02:13:24.117]  Alright, and folks, he's very busy.
[02:13:24.157 --> 02:13:25.598]  Just don't talk his ear off.
[02:13:25.618 --> 02:13:27.479]  If you can help him, he's suing.
[02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:31.102]  Or if you want to come to the march, or you want to get involved.
[02:13:31.122 --> 02:13:32.183]  And this is all over the country.
[02:13:32.403 --> 02:13:35.405]  Guaranteed, folks, this is going on in your system.
[02:13:35.625 --> 02:13:36.846]  Guaranteed.
[02:13:36.866 --> 02:13:38.727]  I mean, prisons have always been bad.
[02:13:39.228 --> 02:13:40.489]  Orphanages have always been bad.
[02:13:40.529 --> 02:13:43.051]  But now, we do it bigger and better in America.
[02:13:43.311 --> 02:13:44.752]  And it's scary.
[02:13:45.464 --> 02:13:48.768]  I like to just tell TYC, let our children go.
[02:13:48.788 --> 02:13:50.450]  You know?
[02:13:52.672 --> 02:13:53.253]  Absolutely.
[02:13:53.373 --> 02:13:59.339]  Well, again, as bad as it is with them torturing 10 and 15 year olds, it's the babies.
[02:13:59.620 --> 02:14:00.481]  Yeah.
[02:14:00.501 --> 02:14:06.888]  I mean, because imagine Rick, as bad as it's been for you, my investigations into the small children, it is hell on earth, man.
[02:14:07.663 --> 02:14:08.564]  It is hell on earth.
[02:14:08.584 --> 02:14:09.525]  I mean, I get so mad.
[02:14:09.565 --> 02:14:12.827]  I guarantee you, I could probably crush people's skulls with my bare hands.
[02:14:12.867 --> 02:14:13.528]  I get so mad.
[02:14:13.548 --> 02:14:19.593]  I mean, and that's the type of rage I feel just to think about what they can do to a little bitty innocence.
[02:14:20.554 --> 02:14:21.975]  And they revel in it.
[02:14:22.055 --> 02:14:29.621]  I mean, people who aren't control freaks, people who aren't into power over others, don't know what, cannot get into the mindset of these demons.
[02:14:30.622 --> 02:14:31.983]  They're evil people.
[02:14:33.124 --> 02:14:33.765]  Very evil.
[02:14:34.571 --> 02:14:46.759]  And uh, the thing that uh, Jay is uh, Jay that's working right now, that was appointed, he's a good man, he's a Marine, he says he's going in there to kick some butt.
[02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:48.480]  Uh, Jay who?
[02:14:48.921 --> 02:14:53.323]  Jay, uh, uh, Brent, uh... Well just tell us, who is it?
[02:14:53.343 --> 02:14:53.804]  I mean, what's going on?
[02:14:53.824 --> 02:14:55.545]  Well, he's the one that was appointed by the Governor.
[02:14:56.301 --> 02:14:58.002]  Oh sure, the master.
[02:14:58.122 --> 02:14:59.483]  Master, yeah.
[02:15:00.464 --> 02:15:01.905]  And so you think he's really going to get them?
[02:15:02.285 --> 02:15:03.086]  I think he's a good man.
[02:15:03.146 --> 02:15:05.247]  I think he's cleaning up house.
[02:15:06.008 --> 02:15:10.231]  And I think if we give him a little more time, he's going to clean more house.
[02:15:11.072 --> 02:15:13.413]  I think it should start here in Austin.
[02:15:13.673 --> 02:15:20.458]  It should start with, they admit that thousands were felons, and they admitted every facility that was raping going on.
[02:15:21.098 --> 02:15:23.860]  I want to see those people in life in prison.
[02:15:23.900 --> 02:15:24.521]  In prison, yes.
[02:15:25.699 --> 02:15:28.741]  Frankly, I think when you're doing it to children, I think some of them should be executed.
[02:15:28.761 --> 02:15:38.327]  I would personally, with these guards that rape children, I would personally pull the lever to release the lethal injection.
[02:15:40.086 --> 02:15:41.306]  Well, I mean... They need to die.
[02:15:42.387 --> 02:15:50.570]  Because we need to start... people need to start dying so they start respecting goodness again, and so they start respecting honor, and they stop hurting children.
[02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:51.230]  Correct.
[02:15:51.670 --> 02:15:55.111]  And again, that's just my instinct, is these people need to die.
[02:15:56.312 --> 02:15:58.593]  And then you know, that's how America's feeling right now.
[02:15:59.413 --> 02:15:59.673]  Okay?
[02:15:59.833 --> 02:16:05.095]  Because I'm threatened by them, I'm sick of them, and I know what they are.
[02:16:05.995 --> 02:16:07.616]  If you can see my eyes, I don't sleep good.
[02:16:08.465 --> 02:16:10.706]  I haven't slept good since my son was taken.
[02:16:10.726 --> 02:16:16.327]  It's a crime.
[02:16:17.048 --> 02:16:17.948]  And they're hiding it.
[02:16:17.988 --> 02:16:23.430]  The greatest crime is authority with power with impunity carrying out evil.
[02:16:24.230 --> 02:16:25.570]  Tyranny is the ultimate evil.
[02:16:25.650 --> 02:16:26.531]  It is powerful.
[02:16:26.571 --> 02:16:27.351]  It is oppressive.
[02:16:27.731 --> 02:16:28.831]  It's smiley faced.
[02:16:28.911 --> 02:16:29.732]  It loves what it does.
[02:16:31.633 --> 02:16:32.613]  And I want to bring them down.
[02:16:32.773 --> 02:16:42.676]  I want to take the people that carried out 9-11, the people that need to all be tried by a jury of their peers, and if they oppressed or they raped or they killed, they need to die.
[02:16:42.696 --> 02:16:44.996]  It's that simple.
[02:16:45.076 --> 02:16:46.796]  And we need to let the system know.
[02:16:47.397 --> 02:16:48.237]  Folks, this isn't a joke.
[02:16:48.277 --> 02:16:49.077]  We're tired of you.
[02:16:49.117 --> 02:16:50.057]  You're not our God.
[02:16:50.077 --> 02:16:52.078]  That's the most sick thing.
[02:16:52.118 --> 02:16:53.338]  They act like they rule everything.
[02:16:53.358 --> 02:16:54.558]  We should be so thankful to them.
[02:16:54.718 --> 02:16:55.899]  They're a bunch of trash.
[02:16:56.439 --> 02:16:56.699]  Rick?
[02:16:57.039 --> 02:16:57.559]  Yes, they are.
[02:17:00.188 --> 02:17:05.874]  Well, just pray to God that your son be healed of all the great scars they put on him, Rick.
[02:17:06.434 --> 02:17:12.740]  And again, it was great seeing you the other night, and I appreciate you coming in today, and I know I've just been ranting here, but this stuff just freaks me out.
[02:17:13.381 --> 02:17:17.205]  I wouldn't hurt a fly, and I know you wouldn't.
[02:17:17.225 --> 02:17:18.506]  I don't know how people do this.
[02:17:18.646 --> 02:17:20.568]  I don't know how they engage in this type of evil.
[02:17:22.824 --> 02:17:23.465]  It's just sickening.
[02:17:23.665 --> 02:17:24.566]  I just want to destroy him.
[02:17:24.626 --> 02:17:26.448]  It's very sickening.
[02:17:27.009 --> 02:17:32.815]  And the thing that gets to me is that it's been going on for a long time.
[02:17:32.875 --> 02:17:34.937]  Well, it's starting to come out and a lot of that's because of you.
[02:17:35.598 --> 02:17:36.178]  So God bless you.
[02:17:36.218 --> 02:17:36.739]  We'll pray for you.
[02:17:36.759 --> 02:17:37.460]  Thanks for coming in.
[02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:37.920]  Thank you.
[02:17:38.601 --> 02:17:40.263]  We'll be right back with the Rosie O'Donnell News.
[02:17:45.945 --> 02:17:51.191]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:17:51.331 --> 02:17:59.420]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:17:59.681 --> 02:18:06.729]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:18:07.670 --> 02:18:14.154]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:18:14.354 --> 02:18:19.438]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:18:19.558 --> 02:18:28.444]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:18:28.704 --> 02:18:31.987]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:18:34.088 --> 02:18:38.551]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:18:47.517 --> 02:18:51.179]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:57.003]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:18:57.463 --> 02:19:02.627]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:19:03.267 --> 02:19:16.590]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:19:17.070 --> 02:19:22.391]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:19:22.692 --> 02:19:28.573]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:19:36.463 --> 02:19:38.606]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:19:38.626 --> 02:19:38.686]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:46.770 --> 02:19:49.111]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.231 --> 02:19:59.696]  Did you know that President Kennedy signed into law State Department Publication 7277 entitled, The United States Program for Complete and General Disarmament in a Peaceful World?
[02:19:59.776 --> 02:20:04.958]  This would disarm America and turn all of our armed forces over to the United Nations Organization.
[02:20:05.719 --> 02:20:10.161]  Citizens would be required to turn in their guns guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment.
[02:20:10.868 --> 02:20:16.550]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.

[02:20:47.916 --> 02:20:53.378]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[02:20:53.558 --> 02:20:58.320]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[02:20:58.660 --> 02:21:00.980]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[02:21:01.160 --> 02:21:03.741]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called No-BO.
[02:21:04.001 --> 02:21:12.144]  No-BO eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[02:21:12.324 --> 02:21:16.425]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in No-BO.
[02:21:16.525 --> 02:21:16.725]  Yup!
[02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:54.106]  I guarantee you, a hundred years ago if people were acting like this with children,
[02:22:16.371 --> 02:22:18.493]  There'd be a lynch mob and they'd all be strung up.
[02:22:20.694 --> 02:22:21.275]  Real fast.
[02:22:21.335 --> 02:22:22.456]  People didn't behave like this.
[02:22:22.476 --> 02:22:23.376]  People didn't act like this.
[02:22:23.396 --> 02:22:24.497]  It was very, very rare.
[02:22:24.517 --> 02:22:28.560]  If you had some weird murder or kidnapping, it'd be national news.
[02:22:31.402 --> 02:22:32.403]  It was a different time.
[02:22:32.463 --> 02:22:37.727]  I mean, men would go out in the street and gun each other down over arguments, but crime itself was very, very low.
[02:22:41.068 --> 02:22:43.349]  And it's all a social worker paradise.
[02:22:43.369 --> 02:22:44.670]  We're all going to be micromanaged.
[02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:48.532]  I've got articles today where everybody's going to have CPS in their house.
[02:22:49.592 --> 02:22:49.852]  Everybody.
[02:22:49.872 --> 02:22:51.033]  It doesn't matter how much money you got.
[02:22:51.053 --> 02:22:53.294]  You're going to have CPS visiting you.
[02:22:53.314 --> 02:22:54.295]  This is the new America.
[02:22:54.315 --> 02:22:59.077]  Alright, I'm going to get into Rosie O'Donnell right now.
[02:22:59.437 --> 02:23:01.478]  Like it or not, this is going to go supernova.
[02:23:02.599 --> 02:23:03.919]  It's going to get major attention.
[02:23:04.259 --> 02:23:07.981]  You thought all the news of last week on 9-11 Truth and Loose Change was big.
[02:23:08.021 --> 02:23:09.382]  Get ready now, Rosie O'Donnell.
[02:23:10.129 --> 02:23:12.490]  Eleven minute discussion on The View today.
[02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:20.372]  We'll play part of it now, come back and play the rest, then I'll comment on it, and then I'm going to get into a bunch of other news and wrap up this transmission.
[02:23:20.392 --> 02:23:30.375]  But go to PrisonPlanet.com, continual coverage of this, and help us try to inject more information into the debate.
[02:23:30.455 --> 02:23:34.416]  We need to add to the Rosie O'Donnell Show about the new blueprints coming out, the Building 7 news.
[02:23:34.797 --> 02:23:37.957]  Everybody kind of, it was a big push and it had a big effect.
[02:23:38.017 --> 02:23:39.558]  It's one of the reasons Rosie went public.
[02:23:40.146 --> 02:23:44.691]  Was the BBC footage of Building 7 falling before it fell?
[02:23:46.313 --> 02:23:47.594]  See, we've kind of forgotten about that.
[02:23:47.634 --> 02:23:49.015]  We need to repush all that.
[02:23:49.516 --> 02:23:53.300]  We need to introduce that into that story that Paul's adding to.
[02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:55.542]  Go get it at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:23:55.602 --> 02:23:56.203]  Please help us.
[02:23:56.903 --> 02:23:59.106]  Here's Rosie O'Donnell, The View, a couple hours ago.
[02:24:07.319 --> 02:24:07.699]  In the news!
[02:24:07.839 --> 02:24:09.000]  Very, very big thing.
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:15.024]  There is a British patrol boat that was in the waters off the coast of Iran, in between Iraq and Iran, in the water there.
[02:24:15.364 --> 02:24:24.050]  They're saying that Iranians are saying they came into Iranian water and the Iranians have taken these people and they're considered now being held hostage.
[02:24:24.631 --> 02:24:32.316]  And the British government is saying that this is very serious and everybody needs to look at this and to see what it is.
[02:24:32.376 --> 02:24:36.919]  The Iranians are saying, if you admit that you are in our water, we will let go the hostages.
[02:24:37.399 --> 02:24:39.620]  How do they know they were in the water, exactly?
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:40.260]  I'm in a pool.
[02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:41.761]  I don't even know where the deep end is.
[02:24:41.861 --> 02:24:44.942]  How do they know?
[02:24:44.982 --> 02:24:45.842]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:24:46.522 --> 02:24:52.744]  It's very complicated to see which water is whose, but what they're saying is that they came into what the Iranians consider their zone.
[02:24:52.784 --> 02:24:59.226]  Of course, the British are saying, well, we have GPS satellites to say we weren't there, and the Iranians are saying, well, we have satellites to say you were.
[02:24:59.726 --> 02:25:03.188]  The Iraqis are saying that they were not in Iranian water also, I think.
[02:25:04.688 --> 02:25:07.270]  They just watched the location too, didn't they?
[02:25:07.310 --> 02:25:11.972]  I just heard that at first they were spotted in one location, now they're saying it could have been another location.
[02:25:12.052 --> 02:25:15.334]  Yeah, there's a lot of confusing information about where they actually were.
[02:25:15.354 --> 02:25:30.943]  But they were on television in Iran and they released it all over the country that they showed the hostages who are not visibly injured or tortured and the woman was wearing the traditional headgear and speaking saying, you know, yes we were in the wrong place, which of course
[02:25:31.463 --> 02:25:39.326]  You know, everyone says she was coerced to say that, but Tony Blair is very concerned that this is a violation of the Geneva Convention to show hostages.
[02:25:39.406 --> 02:25:42.708]  Well, and it also seems to be some people are saying that this is an act of retaliation.
[02:25:42.728 --> 02:25:49.050]  There were some Iranians captured in Iraq for distributing arms there illegally, so they're saying this could be a retaliation for that.
[02:25:49.170 --> 02:25:57.434]  Or the fact that the UN and other countries are trying to put more pressure on them to end their nuclear enrichment program right now.
[02:25:57.454 --> 02:25:57.974]  Supposed?
[02:25:58.374 --> 02:25:58.934]  Yes!
[02:25:59.095 --> 02:26:04.278]  Well, I mean... Well, because Iraq supposedly had a nuclear enrichment program, too, but they didn't actually.
[02:26:04.298 --> 02:26:07.020]  They were also violating the 17 UN resolutions.
[02:26:07.140 --> 02:26:10.422]  Yes, so were we by invading them against the UN's advice, right?
[02:26:10.442 --> 02:26:11.082]  That was one.
[02:26:11.583 --> 02:26:16.546]  Yeah, but still, if we break the rules of the UN, why should any other nation follow the rules of the UN?
[02:26:17.986 --> 02:26:18.947]  No one should follow them now.
[02:26:18.987 --> 02:26:21.428]  I mean that would be insane if no one would follow them now.
[02:26:21.528 --> 02:26:29.391]  An incident like this causes such turmoil in the world and you know you're just trying to live your life and the next thing you know they'll explode a bomb and then we'll be in a world war.
[02:26:29.411 --> 02:26:30.031]  But who's they?
[02:26:30.211 --> 02:26:31.112]  Well whoever it is!
[02:26:31.492 --> 02:26:39.715]  I'm not a conspiracy theory type of person but you know you have to look at both sides of the situation.
[02:26:39.755 --> 02:26:42.016]  You have a lot of issues going on here.
[02:26:42.216 --> 02:26:45.079]  So what do you think is really happening with the ship that was in there?
[02:26:45.100 --> 02:26:49.365]  You think that these British soldiers were used as pawns to try to ignite another war against Iran?
[02:26:49.665 --> 02:26:56.053]  Well, I just think if Iran really did take them, and they really wanted to hold them hostage, they would have done what they did during the Jimmy Carter era.
[02:26:56.373 --> 02:26:57.835]  What, you don't think that they really were taken?
[02:26:58.533 --> 02:26:59.434]  Well, of course they were taken.
[02:26:59.694 --> 02:27:09.481]  But my point is that if they wanted to hold them, if this was a purposeful attack by the Iranian government to provoke an international incident, why would they say, well, we'll let them go and we're not going to harm them?
[02:27:10.081 --> 02:27:13.283]  We will let them go, we're not going to harm them, but you have to admit you came into our water.
[02:27:13.784 --> 02:27:16.185]  And the British are, well, we're not going to admit that, yeah, but we're not going to harm them.
[02:27:16.205 --> 02:27:17.266]  We're going to let them go.
[02:27:17.626 --> 02:27:19.167]  She gets into it on the other side.
[02:27:19.968 --> 02:27:23.650]  Stay with us and we'll get into a bunch of other really important news today.
[02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:24.231]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.524 --> 02:27:38.545]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.445 --> 02:27:42.225]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.526 --> 02:27:48.147]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[02:27:48.287 --> 02:27:54.428]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[02:27:54.568 --> 02:28:03.710]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.
[02:28:03.930 --> 02:28:04.690]  It's called Slender FX.
[02:28:05.410 --> 02:28:14.640]  SlenderFX opens the door for a healthy metabolism, permanent weight loss, reduction of low thyroid symptoms, and considerably increased energy by helping to balance your leptin levels.
[02:28:14.941 --> 02:28:17.003]  Finally, a weight loss breakthrough you can trust.

[02:28:45.407 --> 02:28:45.987]  It's a fact.
[02:28:46.187 --> 02:28:50.628]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:28:50.949 --> 02:28:56.170]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[02:28:56.430 --> 02:28:59.631]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[02:28:59.891 --> 02:29:06.993]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[02:29:07.373 --> 02:29:14.561]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[02:29:14.802 --> 02:29:16.904]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[02:29:17.304 --> 02:29:22.210]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated
[02:29:22.210 --> 02:29:22.771]  We're good to go.
[02:29:45.282 --> 02:29:49.843]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:29:50.264 --> 02:29:53.185]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:29:53.505 --> 02:29:56.065]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:29:56.426 --> 02:30:01.247]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:30:01.627 --> 02:30:06.989]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:30:07.309 --> 02:30:10.270]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:30:10.450 --> 02:30:12.171]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[02:30:13.111 --> 02:30:17.833]  Many people believe that this will be the Mark of the Beast because of the restrictive measures included.
[02:30:18.013 --> 02:30:22.135]  Which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[02:30:22.455 --> 02:30:28.738]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the Mark of the Beast, it says, If any man worship the Beast, take notice.
[02:30:29.078 --> 02:30:30.699]  It says, worship the Beast.
[02:30:30.979 --> 02:30:33.580]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[02:30:33.920 --> 02:30:38.922]  Alright, let's go back to the view this morning in Progress, where they're debating about, is this a shut-up with Iran?
[02:31:03.812 --> 02:31:05.033]  Gee, I wonder.
[02:31:05.294 --> 02:31:07.576]  We don't know the exact details, but we know it's a set-up.
[02:31:08.017 --> 02:31:13.562]  You've got all these troops, all these task forces, they want to strike, and then magically they get picked up.
[02:31:13.843 --> 02:31:16.846]  Why would the Iranians do that and provocateur an attack?
[02:31:17.987 --> 02:31:25.835]  It's either a set-up by them to get attacked, to strengthen the hardliners who are in danger of being overthrown, or it's the neocons, and I tend to think it's the neocons.
[02:31:26.511 --> 02:31:29.252]  But regardless, it's just more government criminality.
[02:31:29.292 --> 02:31:30.773]  The government's not your friend.
[02:31:30.793 --> 02:31:32.754]  The government's not going to help you in Iraq.
[02:31:32.794 --> 02:31:34.195]  They're not going to help you in New Orleans.
[02:31:34.455 --> 02:31:37.776]  They're not going to help you right here in Texas with the 3,000 missing children in Florida.
[02:31:37.796 --> 02:31:39.057]  All right, here's Rosie O'Donnell.
[02:31:39.097 --> 02:31:40.658]  Well, of course they were taken.
[02:31:40.898 --> 02:31:50.682]  But my point is that if they wanted to hold them, if this was a purposeful attack by the Iranian government to provoke an international incident, why would they say, well, we'll let them go and we're not going to harm them?
[02:31:51.282 --> 02:31:52.143]  We will let them go.
[02:31:52.163 --> 02:31:52.923]  We're not going to harm them.
[02:31:52.943 --> 02:31:54.444]  But you have to admit, you came into our water.
[02:31:54.944 --> 02:31:56.305]  And British go, well we're not going to admit that.
[02:31:56.325 --> 02:31:57.366]  Yeah, but we're not going to harm them.
[02:31:57.707 --> 02:31:58.627]  We're going to let them go.
[02:31:58.768 --> 02:32:04.472]  They also want the release of their Iranian people that were captured in Iraq for, like I said, just carrying out the army.
[02:32:04.492 --> 02:32:05.293]  No, they haven't said that.
[02:32:05.373 --> 02:32:06.674]  They haven't said quid pro quo.
[02:32:06.694 --> 02:32:09.817]  They said if you admit you came into our water, we will let them go.
[02:32:09.837 --> 02:32:11.939]  So what are you thinking about the Brits?
[02:32:11.959 --> 02:32:16.483]  It would show them in a very bright light, and it would show us as trespassers, but we don't know that they would let them go.
[02:32:16.523 --> 02:32:17.364]  We don't know how it would go.
[02:32:17.384 --> 02:32:18.705]  Here's the problem, what you just said, us.
[02:32:19.205 --> 02:32:23.169]  Because it's now Britain and the United States, pretty much, against the rest of the world.
[02:32:23.569 --> 02:32:24.390]  How did this happen?
[02:32:24.450 --> 02:32:35.139]  So you think now that, are you assuming then that this was something put together by our administration and Tony Blair in terms of staging this act so that we could get into Iran?
[02:32:35.179 --> 02:32:38.282]  Because that would make for a very, maybe, smart president.
[02:32:38.622 --> 02:32:41.104]  And everyone seems to be thinking that he can't work for them.
[02:32:41.184 --> 02:32:42.285]  Say it again!
[02:32:42.305 --> 02:32:43.126]  Say it again!
[02:32:43.746 --> 02:32:44.607]  Wait a minute.
[02:32:44.647 --> 02:32:46.409]  When you say that he's smart, I have no idea.
[02:32:46.949 --> 02:32:53.230]  Turn again and go slow.
[02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:57.111]  You're saying that if these... Here's what happened.
[02:32:57.471 --> 02:32:59.252]  These guys went here, okay?
[02:32:59.652 --> 02:33:00.992]  Iran said, that's our water.
[02:33:01.232 --> 02:33:02.012]  Get out of our water.
[02:33:02.052 --> 02:33:02.852]  We're taking you back.
[02:33:03.012 --> 02:33:04.493]  Britain says, they took our guys.
[02:33:04.573 --> 02:33:05.953]  Iran goes, no, you were in our water.
[02:33:06.273 --> 02:33:08.214]  Say you're in our water and we'll give you the map.
[02:33:08.234 --> 02:33:10.054]  So what do you think is the cause behind that?
[02:33:10.314 --> 02:33:14.415]  Well, there are many, many ways to think of it, but historically, have governments ever
[02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:19.223]  Faked incidents or incited incidents in order to get them into wars.
[02:33:19.303 --> 02:33:21.885]  Do you think that has happened historically?
[02:33:21.965 --> 02:33:22.706]  I'm sure it has.
[02:33:22.726 --> 02:33:24.267]  I don't think this is the case right here.
[02:33:24.287 --> 02:33:29.852]  I don't think that there was a conspiracy between Bush and Tony Blair to put these soldiers in us pawns so that we can jump into Iran.
[02:33:29.872 --> 02:33:32.454]  I think we're going to try to use other methods to stop their program.
[02:33:32.714 --> 02:33:38.337]  The federal asks that we use diplomatic methods to get out of it, and that's where I wish that we would.
[02:33:38.357 --> 02:33:46.941]  I mean, I wish everybody would exercise diplomacy and compromise, and sometimes you have to give something up in order to achieve something better, peace.
[02:33:47.321 --> 02:33:53.184]  Sometimes you have to do that, and it seems like it's those ideologies that are not being talked about enough.
[02:33:53.244 --> 02:33:55.225]  What would a diplomatic compromise be?
[02:33:55.265 --> 02:33:57.526]  What would a diplomatic summit be here?
[02:33:57.586 --> 02:34:01.868]  It's just so very hard in America when anyone from the Mideast has been so demonized.
[02:34:02.248 --> 02:34:09.834]  That no matter what, it's impossible for some people to believe that the Iranians in any way could ever do anything ethical, in any capacity.
[02:34:09.854 --> 02:34:11.855]  I think that they've somehow been dehumanized.
[02:34:11.875 --> 02:34:15.377]  This is a point where they're not people, they're just the enemy.
[02:34:15.478 --> 02:34:20.601]  We're not talking about the Iranian people, we're talking about their government, who essentially has total control over them.
[02:34:20.621 --> 02:34:22.362]  They essentially have zero say in this government.
[02:34:22.382 --> 02:34:24.584]  Well that's how people see us, I hope, in the world.
[02:34:24.824 --> 02:34:26.105]  Our government, right?
[02:34:26.185 --> 02:34:32.088]  I hope people across the world don't think what George Bush is doing represents the American people because the last election showed it does not.
[02:34:32.128 --> 02:34:38.591]  But let me ask you this, what concerns me is that there's this environment now where we're almost more apt to trust our enemies than our allies.
[02:34:38.671 --> 02:34:39.931]  And that's very concerning to me.
[02:34:40.111 --> 02:34:45.574]  Everyone in the Bush administration for that, they've completely annihilated all of our trust.
[02:34:45.594 --> 02:34:49.276]  See, I trust our allies and I trust our government much more than I trust our enemies on the war on terror.
[02:34:49.296 --> 02:34:54.058]  But would you say, Elizabeth, that you trust the Bush administration as much as you did when he first took office?
[02:34:55.894 --> 02:35:06.137]  Would you admit... You know what, in a time of war, I think you are in a position where you have to... Nearly everyone in this administration is under indictment or suspicion.
[02:35:06.477 --> 02:35:07.777]  Nearly every person.
[02:35:08.138 --> 02:35:12.319]  From Karl Rove, to Rumsfeld, to Gonzales.
[02:35:12.459 --> 02:35:15.580]  What do you have to do to get impeached in this country?
[02:35:22.554 --> 02:35:25.475]  You have to have Monica Lewinsky come into your office.
[02:35:25.535 --> 02:35:26.956]  That's what you have to do.
[02:35:26.976 --> 02:35:30.437]  Let me tell you something.
[02:35:30.497 --> 02:35:33.698]  People will laugh at that incident.
[02:35:33.718 --> 02:35:35.138]  People will brush that off.
[02:35:35.178 --> 02:35:39.220]  And I'm going to be, Monica, and I'm going to be discreet because your daughter's here.
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:43.861]  But let me tell you, while he was enjoying himself, there were things going on in this world.
[02:35:43.901 --> 02:35:48.383]  Namely, three times he could have had Othelmo de Madon within his scope, and he was too busy to try to offer them.
[02:35:51.445 --> 02:35:53.126]  He was enjoying himself at that moment.
[02:35:53.146 --> 02:35:55.387]  I'm sure he wasn't doing nothing but enjoying himself.
[02:35:55.427 --> 02:35:56.388]  No, I don't think so.
[02:35:56.428 --> 02:35:57.008]  I think he saw.
[02:35:57.028 --> 02:35:58.989]  The other guy was as bad.
[02:35:59.009 --> 02:35:59.870]  The other guy was as bad.
[02:35:59.910 --> 02:36:00.550]  He did his job.
[02:36:00.650 --> 02:36:02.631]  I digress from what the real issue is.
[02:36:02.811 --> 02:36:04.592]  But even you worded a war on terror.
[02:36:04.732 --> 02:36:06.553]  I think personally that is propaganda.
[02:36:06.673 --> 02:36:07.514]  Exactly!
[02:36:07.554 --> 02:36:07.874]  Thank you!
[02:36:10.055 --> 02:36:11.956]  I don't like the wording of it like that.
[02:36:11.976 --> 02:36:12.116]  Why?
[02:36:12.136 --> 02:36:14.958]  Because it makes people into evil and good.
[02:36:15.018 --> 02:36:20.822]  I'm sorry, but the people who... Look, listen, I'm Johnny, Johnny got a job, but doesn't get married.
[02:36:20.862 --> 02:36:21.982]  He's a bad guy.
[02:36:22.102 --> 02:36:23.223]  He's a very bad guy.
[02:36:23.243 --> 02:36:25.204]  He didn't say that explicitly.
[02:36:25.244 --> 02:36:26.865]  He wants to wipe Israel off the map.
[02:36:27.165 --> 02:36:28.466]  This guy is a bad guy.
[02:36:28.486 --> 02:36:31.608]  Am I saying he's a good guy and I want him over for breakfast?
[02:36:31.648 --> 02:36:32.088]  No, I'm not.
[02:36:33.649 --> 02:36:39.852]  I'm saying that in America we are fed propaganda and if you want to know what's happening in the world, go outside of the U.S.
[02:36:39.912 --> 02:36:42.393]  media because it's owned by four corporations.
[02:36:42.513 --> 02:36:43.553]  One of them is this one.
[02:36:43.973 --> 02:36:44.694]  And you know what?
[02:36:44.754 --> 02:36:50.176]  Go outside of the country to find out what's going on in our own country because it's frightening.
[02:36:50.656 --> 02:36:51.477]  It's frightening!
[02:36:51.777 --> 02:36:53.918]  And if you don't... Do you think we're being brainwashed as a whole country?
[02:36:53.998 --> 02:36:54.738]  I think not.
[02:36:54.758 --> 02:37:01.381]  I think if democracy is threatened in a way it hasn't been in 200 years and if America doesn't stand up, we're in big trouble.
[02:37:07.310 --> 02:37:08.251]  You want the war here?
[02:37:08.351 --> 02:37:12.095]  All I want Elizabeth to do is admit it was a mistake to go into Iraq.
[02:37:12.135 --> 02:37:12.796]  Just do that.
[02:37:13.557 --> 02:37:15.099]  I don't see it as a mistake.
[02:37:15.139 --> 02:37:16.620]  You still don't see it as a mistake.
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:20.064]  I'm in a no-bid contract for five years, hallowed burdens.
[02:37:20.104 --> 02:37:21.365]  Wait a second.
[02:37:21.385 --> 02:37:21.786]  $16 billion.
[02:37:21.826 --> 02:37:24.028]  You want to know why we'd go into Iran?
[02:37:24.389 --> 02:37:25.430]  For the money.
[02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:27.492]  That's why we would do it.
[02:37:31.195 --> 02:37:35.578]  We're the oldest democracy in the world.
[02:37:35.598 --> 02:37:36.799]  And that's something to be proud of.
[02:37:36.839 --> 02:37:38.099]  We're the oldest democracy in the world.
[02:37:38.119 --> 02:37:39.841]  And we're a democracy founded on capitalism.
[02:37:40.081 --> 02:37:45.324]  But capitalism, the definition is not, where we are right now is capitalism run amok.
[02:37:45.844 --> 02:37:54.871]  And there was an ideology in the early democracies that were a lot more about community and a lot more about helping your neighborhood and your country.
[02:37:55.111 --> 02:37:58.013]  And now I feel like we're in kind of an imperialistic stage.
[02:37:58.053 --> 02:38:01.735]  And that's not the ideologies of our forefathers in democracy.
[02:38:01.776 --> 02:38:02.336]  Let me clarify.
[02:38:02.396 --> 02:38:04.577]  In terms of this war, do I think we went in in the right way?
[02:38:04.618 --> 02:38:05.958]  No, we could have done things a lot better.
[02:38:05.978 --> 02:38:07.239]  We should have gone in with more troops.
[02:38:07.339 --> 02:38:09.481]  There should have been... I'm not a military strategist.
[02:38:09.501 --> 02:38:12.563]  No, but do you think Iraq had anything to do with 9-11, Elizabeth?
[02:38:12.983 --> 02:38:13.704]  You know what?
[02:38:13.784 --> 02:38:15.025]  That's something that I struggle with.
[02:38:15.505 --> 02:38:17.747]  Did Iraq have anything to do with blowing up the Twin Towers?
[02:38:17.767 --> 02:38:28.415]  I believe that at the time, George Bush was our president, was faced with a decision, and all the evidence stated that it did, and all the evidence that all the Democrats who voted for this war saw... Not all the evidence!
[02:38:28.475 --> 02:38:29.796]  All the cherry-picked evidence!
[02:38:29.816 --> 02:38:39.823]  Okay, well, the evidence that they saw indicated that Iraq had a part in 9-11, and that they were plotting to use those weapons of mass destruction in the future just now.
[02:38:39.863 --> 02:38:45.007]  Hang on, he had the choice to make the mistake and go in there, assuming that they did or that they didn't, okay?
[02:38:45.287 --> 02:38:48.289]  I'd rather him make the mistake on the fact that yes, they had it and at least we went in there.
[02:38:48.309 --> 02:38:49.169]  Okay, let me ask you one more thing.
[02:38:49.189 --> 02:38:53.892]  Do you think the government purposely misled the American people to believe that Iraq had something to do with 9-11?
[02:38:53.912 --> 02:38:54.072]  No.
[02:38:54.212 --> 02:38:56.693]  Yes, says the crowd!
[02:39:01.841 --> 02:39:04.202]  Do you believe in a conspiracy in terms of the attack of 9-11?
[02:39:04.563 --> 02:39:08.206]  No, but I do believe that it is the first time in history that fire has ever melted steel.
[02:39:08.706 --> 02:39:14.691]  I do believe that it defies physics for the World Trade Center Tower 7, Building 7, which collapsed in on itself.
[02:39:15.071 --> 02:39:18.774]  It is impossible for a building to fall the way it fell without explosives being involved.
[02:39:19.075 --> 02:39:20.216]  World Trade Center 7.
[02:39:20.436 --> 02:39:23.298]  World Trader 1 and 2 got hit by planes.
[02:39:23.318 --> 02:39:25.300]  7, miraculously the first time in history
[02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:27.602]  Steel was melted by fire.
[02:39:27.842 --> 02:39:29.544]  It is physically impossible.
[02:39:29.644 --> 02:39:31.025]  And who do you think is responsible for that?
[02:39:31.065 --> 02:39:31.786]  I have no idea.
[02:39:31.926 --> 02:39:36.771]  But to say that we don't know that it imploded and it was an implosion and a demolition is beyond ignorant.
[02:39:36.811 --> 02:39:40.755]  Look at the films, get a physics expert here from Yale, from Harvard, pick the school.
[02:39:40.975 --> 02:39:41.876]  It defies reason.
[02:39:42.757 --> 02:39:43.878]  I would do it.
[02:39:43.958 --> 02:39:45.740]  It is the unthinkable.
[02:39:45.820 --> 02:39:50.444]  It is the unthinkable, but imagine if somebody could convince you of that, could prove it to you, Elizabeth.
[02:39:50.544 --> 02:39:51.085]  Just seven.
[02:39:51.145 --> 02:39:55.749]  I don't think it would happen, but if someone could sit here right now and prove that to me, I would open my mind.
[02:39:55.769 --> 02:39:58.291]  Okay, we're going to call up Harvard and we're going to call up Yale.
[02:39:58.552 --> 02:40:01.094]  And we're going to ask somebody from physics to come and explain.
[02:40:01.114 --> 02:40:02.315]  Physics and Bush went to Yale.
[02:40:02.375 --> 02:40:03.156]  How good could they be?
[02:40:15.035 --> 02:40:16.436]  Okay, so let's go through it.
[02:40:16.456 --> 02:40:17.817]  I wrote some notes on all of that.
[02:40:18.738 --> 02:40:19.959]  There is the challenge.
[02:40:20.119 --> 02:40:22.922]  Show us how Building 7 could have fallen from fire.
[02:40:23.342 --> 02:40:24.443]  NIST can't say it.
[02:40:25.143 --> 02:40:29.086]  The blueprints have now been leaked of all the buildings showing the 9-11 Commission lied.
[02:40:30.388 --> 02:40:31.248]  It's all unraveling.
[02:40:31.268 --> 02:40:33.210]  There's more and more whistleblowers constantly.
[02:40:33.270 --> 02:40:34.751]  There is the challenge, you see.
[02:40:35.452 --> 02:40:37.833]  Oh, we'll have someone on to explain how it happened.
[02:40:38.134 --> 02:40:39.575]  We need to have Stephen Jones on.
[02:40:41.300 --> 02:40:44.422]  They can have a debate about it, but see, they can't have a rational debate.
[02:40:44.442 --> 02:40:50.866]  They can have fake debunking by yellow journalism's alma mater, Hearst Publishing.
[02:40:51.807 --> 02:40:52.527]  That's all they can do.
[02:40:53.728 --> 02:40:56.590]  And believe me, they're going to go ape with what she said today.
[02:40:56.710 --> 02:41:07.477]  Number one, though, I predict they won't really attack her on the 9-11 stuff, but as a caveat, a kind of, you know, mint dessert.
[02:41:08.397 --> 02:41:12.300]  What they'll do is they'll say, that traitor is with Akhmedinejad.
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:16.442]  She thinks that the Iranians rightfully grabbed them.
[02:41:17.383 --> 02:41:19.485]  And then they'll take out, now watch, watch this.
[02:41:21.346 --> 02:41:23.347]  Watch, you will see it on Fox probably.
[02:41:24.088 --> 02:41:25.749]  Or it could be going back on CNN.
[02:41:25.809 --> 02:41:26.809]  You will see this.
[02:41:28.030 --> 02:41:29.671]  I've just watched them so long it's gone hard.
[02:41:29.691 --> 02:41:34.374]  They'll take her out of context with a clip going, the British sailors were in their waters.
[02:41:34.454 --> 02:41:37.296]  Now they'll take it out of context because she said that's what the Iranians said.
[02:41:37.316 --> 02:41:38.077]  They'll cut that out.
[02:41:39.525 --> 02:41:39.765]  This is 101.
[02:41:40.025 --> 02:41:41.206]  It's not a hard prediction.
[02:41:41.706 --> 02:41:51.028]  They will just play that over and over again and say, oh, and by the way, the witch, the fat witch, as they called her last time, she also thinks that the government did 9-11.
[02:41:52.369 --> 02:41:53.789]  When what she's done is very smart.
[02:41:54.129 --> 02:41:58.071]  She's walking on a razor blade tightrope here.
[02:41:59.071 --> 02:42:02.152]  Because she said, well, I don't know why they came down, but it never happened before.
[02:42:02.192 --> 02:42:03.252]  We need to look at that.
[02:42:04.172 --> 02:42:06.353]  It's all in a discussion of did Bush do it?
[02:42:07.555 --> 02:42:12.839]  Now, skipping into the other area, she talks about America being brainwashed in the greatest danger of its 200 years.
[02:42:13.239 --> 02:42:15.981]  Four corporations own the media, including the show she's on.
[02:42:16.241 --> 02:42:18.043]  Get outside the controlled media.
[02:42:18.563 --> 02:42:20.485]  Get outside the left-right paradigm.
[02:42:22.366 --> 02:42:24.708]  She said we're fed by the four corporations.
[02:42:27.710 --> 02:42:30.712]  Also, you heard the tactic of, well, the President's so dumb, how'd he carry this out?
[02:42:30.752 --> 02:42:31.773]  The President is
[02:42:33.789 --> 02:42:37.510]  Suffering from long-term use of hardcore narcotics and drugs, folks.
[02:42:38.350 --> 02:42:39.251]  I've met the Governor.
[02:42:39.311 --> 02:42:40.231]  I've been to his speeches.
[02:42:40.291 --> 02:42:41.171]  I've covered the Governor.
[02:42:42.372 --> 02:42:44.092]  I've been arrested under his orders before.
[02:42:44.112 --> 02:42:45.693]  There's videos out on the web.
[02:42:45.813 --> 02:42:47.093]  I know the President.
[02:42:47.913 --> 02:42:50.414]  And he was not brain-damaged eight years ago.
[02:42:51.394 --> 02:42:52.695]  I wouldn't call him razor-sharp.
[02:42:53.695 --> 02:42:54.515]  I'd call him average.
[02:42:54.755 --> 02:42:59.437]  But he could give a pretty good speech without notes or with notes.
[02:43:00.397 --> 02:43:03.078]  It's just the alcohol and drugs has a way of catching up to you.
[02:43:04.211 --> 02:43:07.395]  Oh, well, they can't run Iraq, but they can carry out 9-11.
[02:43:07.455 --> 02:43:08.236]  I always hear that.
[02:43:08.676 --> 02:43:10.278]  Yes, they've done a good job in Iraq.
[02:43:10.318 --> 02:43:20.449]  The plan was break it in three parts, have sectarian war, not let that be a first world nation, have a big problem so they could then have an excuse to stay there and move into Iran and Syria.
[02:43:21.450 --> 02:43:22.932]  They've executed it flawlessly.
[02:43:23.112 --> 02:43:23.793]  Done a great job.
[02:43:25.303 --> 02:43:31.005]  But if it's bringing democracy and freedom and happiness and la-la-la-dee-dee, uh, no, uh, it's a big failure.
[02:43:31.286 --> 02:43:37.828]  The war on drugs, more of you in jail, more juvenile halls, more rape rooms, more drugs than ever on the streets, incredible success.
[02:43:38.108 --> 02:43:39.429]  The drug dealers run the country.
[02:43:40.149 --> 02:43:40.449]  Okay?
[02:43:40.750 --> 02:43:43.551]  I mean, it's real simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:43.891 --> 02:43:48.013]  When you understand that, everything makes perfect sense.
[02:43:50.474 --> 02:43:51.294]  It's real simple.
[02:43:52.634 --> 02:43:56.696]  And every night when I pull the covers up over me, I think, my God, they could kill me any day for what I do.
[02:43:56.756 --> 02:43:57.877]  And I just think, you know what?
[02:43:57.957 --> 02:44:02.840]  It's a good price to pay for my country and my family and for the innocents.
[02:44:02.900 --> 02:44:04.141]  It's what a man's supposed to do.
[02:44:04.541 --> 02:44:06.502]  And I'm ashamed of myself even thinking about it.
[02:44:06.922 --> 02:44:12.706]  But you know how it is in the quiet of the night by yourself to think about death or to go in and look at your children and think about how they could come after them?
[02:44:13.306 --> 02:44:18.968]  And you just got to steel yourself and make the decision and be stoic and just stick your jaw out and go, mmm.
[02:44:19.329 --> 02:44:20.589]  That's just the way it is.
[02:44:21.169 --> 02:44:24.691]  And just hate the enemy that much more and just, you know what?
[02:44:24.811 --> 02:44:27.512]  I may not make it through all of this, folks, but I know one thing.
[02:44:27.952 --> 02:44:29.473]  These New World Order people aren't either.
[02:44:29.513 --> 02:44:30.473]  We're going to get them.
[02:44:30.513 --> 02:44:32.494]  In fact, I told them to send that song up.
[02:44:32.534 --> 02:44:33.434]  I wanted to play it today.
[02:44:33.454 --> 02:44:34.735]  It's what I was talking about yesterday.
[02:44:35.035 --> 02:44:37.776]  Johnny Cash, God's Gonna Cut You Down.
[02:44:37.796 --> 02:44:39.277]  Do you have that?
[02:44:41.238 --> 02:44:42.238]  Did they ever send it to you?
[02:44:44.525 --> 02:44:46.206]  Yeah, there'll be a break and they'll never get it there.
[02:44:46.226 --> 02:44:49.708]  I need you to go to Intercom in here.
[02:44:49.728 --> 02:44:51.148]  I just banged on the wall getting them to come in here.
[02:44:51.768 --> 02:44:52.989]  I really wanted to play that today.
[02:44:53.509 --> 02:44:54.230]  I know they've got it.
[02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:55.510]  I need to send it up to you.
[02:44:56.451 --> 02:44:57.091]  Hey, Trey!
[02:44:57.971 --> 02:45:01.113]  I know he's got headphones on out there doing video editing.
[02:45:01.413 --> 02:45:06.135]  Hey, did he send God's Gonna Cut You Down Johnny Cash yesterday?
[02:45:06.916 --> 02:45:09.777]  Just ask Aaron if they did send it to the playlist upload file.
[02:45:10.597 --> 02:45:11.278]  Oh, you do have it.
[02:45:11.318 --> 02:45:11.558]  Okay.
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:17.262]  You know, I've got all this news I want to cover, but why not just play a Johnny Cash song that says it all?
[02:45:17.282 --> 02:45:18.603]  Because this is my anthem.
[02:45:19.043 --> 02:45:20.504]  This is what I say to you.
[02:45:20.524 --> 02:45:26.107]  You can go on for a long time, for a long time, but one of these days, God's going to cut you down.
[02:45:26.127 --> 02:45:27.027]  And you know what?
[02:45:27.047 --> 02:45:35.171]  If God uses me to cut you down, if God uses me as like a club just to beat while my brains are getting beat out, while he's beating yours out, I'll thank God for that.
[02:45:35.211 --> 02:45:35.952]  You understand me?
[02:45:36.612 --> 02:45:37.393]  You understand me?
[02:45:37.893 --> 02:45:39.974]  That's the commitment we've got to have.
[02:45:41.448 --> 02:45:42.969]  We'll play it after the break when we have time.
[02:45:43.009 --> 02:45:43.589]  Thanks for getting it.
[02:45:45.170 --> 02:45:46.070]  I just remembered that.
[02:45:46.591 --> 02:45:47.571]  I mean, this is the type of stuff.
[02:45:47.791 --> 02:45:50.473]  Governor Richardson says nuclear 9-11 is possible.
[02:45:50.553 --> 02:45:53.174]  If he's elected, the police state will continue to keep us safe.
[02:45:54.094 --> 02:45:55.275]  Big article in the Register.
[02:45:55.595 --> 02:45:57.656]  The biggest technology paper out there.
[02:45:57.736 --> 02:45:58.837]  Biggest technology daily.
[02:45:59.597 --> 02:46:08.262]  Conspiracy theorists, feds, web hosts conspire against us and it says PrisonPlanet.com and others are paranoid nutcases who say the CIA
[02:46:09.429 --> 02:46:15.133]  Now he's involved in drug trafficking and we're nuts and we say that they censor us on the web.
[02:46:16.294 --> 02:46:17.955]  Google admits they've censored us.
[02:46:19.636 --> 02:46:21.137]  Digg admits they censor us.
[02:46:22.638 --> 02:46:28.402]  It's admitted that Google admittedly censors in China and it's come out there doing it here.
[02:46:29.222 --> 02:46:35.286]  We've had high-level CIA officers who've listed the names of the CIA liaison case officer at Google.
[02:46:35.707 --> 02:46:37.268]  Shut up scum!
[02:46:38.738 --> 02:46:39.038]  Stop!
[02:46:39.098 --> 02:46:40.399]  I've got another one right here!
[02:46:41.800 --> 02:46:42.520]  No, don't shut up.
[02:46:42.540 --> 02:46:43.801]  Just keep spouting your lies.
[02:46:43.821 --> 02:46:45.102]  People are going to find out it's a lie.
[02:46:45.542 --> 02:46:48.944]  There's a giant article out of Blog Critics.
[02:46:50.045 --> 02:46:50.925]  It's a big site.
[02:46:53.427 --> 02:46:57.169]  And it says, get a grip, there's no secret North American Union.
[02:46:57.449 --> 02:46:58.930]  To no yuppie evil.
[02:46:59.210 --> 02:47:01.111]  To no yuppie denial.
[02:47:02.177 --> 02:47:11.362]  To understand it, to know how committee chairmen can be making jokes about child rape yesterday in front of families at the Texas Statehouse.
[02:47:11.702 --> 02:47:13.103]  You need to read this, folks.
[02:47:14.444 --> 02:47:15.524]  I'm pure evil.
[02:47:15.624 --> 02:47:16.705]  Lou Dobbs is evil.
[02:47:18.599 --> 02:47:27.626]  At least this is what Paranoid, Anti-Globalist, Human Events, RollNet Daily, InfoWars, and Eagle Forum, plus of course the news network lunatic Lou Dobbs all believe.
[02:47:28.527 --> 02:47:32.550]  Some of these sources have a certain amount of legitimacy in the political circles they appeal to.
[02:47:32.850 --> 02:47:36.053]  They aren't all professional scaremongers like Alex Jones.
[02:47:36.433 --> 02:47:42.698]  Hey, there is a North American Union, they are plunging the dollar, and there are 3,000 plus missing children in Florida.
[02:47:43.723 --> 02:47:44.523]  That the government took.
[02:47:45.264 --> 02:47:48.585]  Now, if that isn't scary, I don't know what is.
[02:47:49.265 --> 02:47:55.548]  And it goes on to say, and there are a dismayingly large number of people who take Dobbs seriously.
[02:47:55.888 --> 02:47:57.089]  Yes, that's right!
[02:47:57.549 --> 02:47:59.730]  There are people that take us seriously.
[02:47:59.890 --> 02:48:07.913]  They can go to the UN website, they can go to the CFR website, they can go to the SPP, who admits world government, but then denies it on their denial page.
[02:48:08.193 --> 02:48:09.414]  That's there for you.
[02:48:09.794 --> 02:48:10.974]  That's not there for us.
[02:48:11.074 --> 02:48:12.055]  They know, we know.
[02:48:12.805 --> 02:48:15.946]  That's there for you who were born and bred to deny everything.
[02:48:17.067 --> 02:48:19.608]  Just give you an excuse to deny it and you'll deny it.
[02:48:21.749 --> 02:48:23.130]  I got stacks of this, man.
[02:48:23.490 --> 02:48:26.931]  British government admits 60,000 plus Iraqi death toll.
[02:48:27.151 --> 02:48:28.572]  Then it goes on to say what the U.S.
[02:48:28.592 --> 02:48:34.955]  government wanted to keep quiet, London independent, was John Hopkins University found the same number of dead Iraqis.
[02:48:37.136 --> 02:48:37.876]  Well, they found 601,000 instead of 655,000.
[02:48:40.467 --> 02:48:41.428]  It's real, folks!
[02:48:41.488 --> 02:48:43.030]  That's how many we've killed!
[02:48:43.050 --> 02:48:51.919]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:54.182]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.562 --> 02:49:02.190]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.890 --> 02:49:09.933]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.333 --> 02:49:21.758]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.078 --> 02:49:25.620]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:27.961]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.301 --> 02:49:32.143]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:34.339 --> 02:52:59.736]  Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news My head's been wet with the midnight dew I've been down on bended knee Talking to the man from Galilee He spoke to me in a voice so sweet I thought I heard the shuffle of angels sing He called my name and my heart stood still When he said, John, go do my will Go tell that long-tongued liar
[02:53:00.596 --> 02:53:02.738]  Go and tell that midnight rider.
[02:53:03.378 --> 02:53:06.440]  Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter.
[02:53:06.821 --> 02:53:09.623]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[02:53:09.743 --> 02:53:12.545]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down.

[02:54:24.082 --> 02:54:33.202]  So you just sit there and you deny there's a North American Union, and you sit there and you deny there's a New World Order, and you deny they've got 3,000 plus children disappeared into hell's pits?
[02:54:33.931 --> 02:54:41.474]  And you sit there and just think about yourself and feel all self-important and just keep running your mouth, keep doing all the stuff you do.
[02:54:42.094 --> 02:54:46.016]  Sooner or later, God is going to cut you down.
[02:54:46.436 --> 02:54:47.957]  Guaranteed!

[02:54:51.218 --> 02:54:53.019]  Your executioner is coming.
[02:54:53.179 --> 02:54:54.299]  Do you hear those wings?
[02:54:54.459 --> 02:54:55.840]  That's the angel of death.
[02:54:56.160 --> 02:54:58.481]  And it's going to be painful before you go.
[02:54:58.701 --> 02:55:00.702]  You did it to yourself, scum!
[02:55:01.182 --> 02:55:02.182]  Understand that!
[02:55:02.523 --> 02:55:03.163]  Know that!
[02:55:03.943 --> 02:55:06.224]  And know that NOTHING ON EARTH'S GONNA STOP IT!
[02:55:07.904 --> 02:55:08.664]  It's that simple.
[02:55:09.024 --> 02:55:11.445]  Ladies and gentlemen, commit yourself against these people.
[02:55:11.505 --> 02:55:12.385]  Commit yourself.
[02:55:13.005 --> 02:55:14.285]  Realize how evil they are.
[02:55:14.405 --> 02:55:15.426]  Research it for yourself.
[02:55:15.486 --> 02:55:16.966]  I haven't plugged my videos all day.
[02:55:18.186 --> 02:55:21.367]  I want you to go to InfoWars.com and I want you to get TerrorStorm.
[02:55:21.407 --> 02:55:22.887]  It's an important film that needs to be seen.
[02:55:22.907 --> 02:55:24.448]  I want you to aggressively make copies.
[02:55:24.508 --> 02:55:24.788]  Please.
[02:55:24.828 --> 02:55:26.208]  Get America Freedom from Fascism.
[02:55:27.583 --> 02:55:28.565]  Get Riddles in Stone.

[02:55:29.627 --> 02:55:31.651]  Get Iraq for Sale, The War Profiteers.
[02:55:32.031 --> 02:55:33.714]  Get all the books and videos we carry.
[02:55:33.754 --> 02:55:34.716]  Get them out to people.
[02:55:34.756 --> 02:55:35.958]  Toll free number to order 888-253-3139.
[02:55:40.091 --> 02:55:48.193]  When you help us, you get tools in the Info War, and in the Info War, you literally, like we're A-10 Warthogs, just load weapons underneath our wings.
[02:55:48.533 --> 02:56:02.135]  And I will go, and I will drop Info Bombs on them, and I will build bigger and bigger weapons of truth to drop on our enemies, and I'm just one person in this fight, just pick up a weapon in the Info War, and just start rampaging forward against the enemy.
[02:56:02.395 --> 02:56:05.556]  We've got the initiative, and we're not going to be stopped with God's help.
[02:56:06.355 --> 02:56:08.597]  Sooner or later, God's gonna cut you down!
[02:56:08.857 --> 02:56:12.659]  And before I get cut down, I'm gonna do some more damage to the New World Order!
[02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:22.126]  Now get out there and get to Infowars.com today, and get to PrisonPlanet.com, and get that story about 9-11, and get it out to the four corners of Earth!
