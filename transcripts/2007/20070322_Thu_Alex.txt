[00:00:05.483 --> 00:00:06.143]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.783 --> 00:00:07.863]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:09.704]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.724 --> 00:00:11.145]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:13.405]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.465 --> 00:00:17.427]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:21.749]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:35.660]  Well, it's extremely irritating to me.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:51.944]  Next my blood pressure, uh, rise, I could bet my bottom dollar on I know exactly who leaked this to the New York Post, page 6, the biggest gossip column in the country.
[00:00:52.624 --> 00:00:57.966]  And you go, what are you talking about, Alex, on this Thursday, the 22nd of March, 2007 edition?
[00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:14.692]  Well, here's the headline, Hollywood's 911 Idiot Brigade by Richard Johnson, who is a New York Post neocon page six writer.
[00:01:16.793 --> 00:01:18.914]  Richard Johnson's page six.
[00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:30.721]  And they have leaked the fact that Charlie Sheen,
[00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:34.151]  I'm not going to say much more because page six doesn't have it all.
[00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:39.394]  Some of the other players involved, but I was going to get Charlie on Monday.
[00:02:03.297 --> 00:02:04.758]  Or was it Tuesday, the 20th?
[00:02:05.818 --> 00:02:14.002]  It would have been Tuesday, the one year anniversary of him going public and causing that whole domino effect.
[00:02:16.123 --> 00:02:31.850]  But we decided to not have him on, to not get him on, because we thought, oh, we'll just get him on in a few months to announce the big launch, and that he is involved in the film, and then when it was going to be hitting theaters.
[00:02:34.915 --> 00:02:52.542]  But then I learned my horror in conversations Monday and Tuesday that the biggest big mouth on the planet at a 9-11 conference in San Diego a few weeks ago had learned of this.
[00:02:55.643 --> 00:03:04.026]  And that same individual went and spilt his guts a time before to New York's Page Six in the New York Post
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.042]  And I just hope it doesn't endanger the project.
[00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:17.387]  Because things like this must be done very delicately, as the Wicked Witch of the West says.
[00:03:17.828 --> 00:03:26.214]  I'm copying Mark Cornkey a few days ago on air, doing that imitation better than I. And this makes me... I knew it!
[00:03:26.394 --> 00:03:29.876]  I mean, you know, when I know something's going to happen, I know it's going to happen.
[00:03:31.437 --> 00:03:32.618]  And I said, what?
[00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.240]  I said, that individual
[00:03:36.523 --> 00:03:37.464]  Knows about it?
[00:03:41.706 --> 00:03:42.887]  And I just said, that's it.
[00:03:43.347 --> 00:03:47.529]  It's going to be in the New York Post within days.
[00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.713]  And I hate having that type of predictive power.
[00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:58.956]  It wasn't hard, 2 plus 2 equals 4, because then I got to call people today and say, see, I told you and that wasn't me.
[00:03:58.976 --> 00:04:01.317]  Of course, they'll find out.
[00:04:01.357 --> 00:04:02.658]  They'll call big mouth.
[00:04:03.914 --> 00:04:07.435]  And Big Mouth will admit it, like Big Mouth did last time.
[00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:11.257]  And I've liked Big Mouth in the past.
[00:04:11.437 --> 00:04:12.597]  Big Mouth is a hero.
[00:04:13.658 --> 00:04:15.938]  But Big Mouth could SCREW THIS UP!
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.043]  And again, I just want to see it get made and get in theaters and fight the New World Order so my children can live in a free country, folks.
[00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:28.183]  I don't have a future.
[00:04:28.283 --> 00:04:29.563]  I'm on the front line.
[00:04:30.084 --> 00:04:30.824]  Unless we beat them.
[00:04:32.822 --> 00:04:35.243]  My head is in the lion's mouth, in the guillotine.
[00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:38.104]  My hind end is hanging way out over the side.
[00:04:39.064 --> 00:04:45.006]  And this type of crap... Loose lips sink ships.
[00:04:48.227 --> 00:04:49.028]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:49.368 --> 00:04:51.228]  I'll go over this unbelievable headpiece.
[00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:56.570]  I am just... I am literally about to smash the desk that's sitting in front of me.
[00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.651]  I am just unbelievably angry.
[00:05:04.227 --> 00:05:09.670]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:17.654]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:25.428]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.828 --> 00:05:37.253]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.573 --> 00:05:41.455]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.515 --> 00:05:43.456]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.796 --> 00:05:47.638]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.093 --> 00:06:06.317]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:06:06.457 --> 00:06:14.563]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:06:14.823 --> 00:06:21.868]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.329]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:29.293]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:06:29.493 --> 00:06:34.577]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:06:34.697 --> 00:06:43.603]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:06:43.843 --> 00:06:47.126]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:06:49.227 --> 00:06:49.568]  We're good.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.842]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:07:04.342 --> 00:07:07.644]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:10.986]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:17.650]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.113]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:07:22.353 --> 00:07:26.715]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:07:26.876 --> 00:07:29.477]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:07:29.497 --> 00:07:32.258]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:35.260]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.562]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:07:39.622 --> 00:07:40.463]  Treasury bonds.
[00:07:40.743 --> 00:07:45.367]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:07:45.547 --> 00:07:47.188]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:47.208 --> 00:07:49.190]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[00:08:02.282 --> 00:08:08.285]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.906 --> 00:08:11.947]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:23.553 --> 00:08:25.334]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:08:25.354 --> 00:08:28.036]  We are back live here into the second segment.
[00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:30.764]  We have wide open phones today.
[00:08:30.784 --> 00:08:33.346]  I've cleared the decks to take your calls and cover the news.
[00:08:34.587 --> 00:08:38.771]  I got up real early this morning and prepared for an hour-long speech I gave at St.
[00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:39.852]  Edwards University.
[00:08:40.673 --> 00:08:55.246]  That is a whole story in and of itself of media censorship and the good guys and the bad guys and just so many facets on its own.
[00:08:56.551 --> 00:09:02.976]  Not talking about Alex Jones in some little speech to a couple classes at a university.
[00:09:03.436 --> 00:09:07.740]  It's just an example, a microcosm of what we live in, what I witnessed there today.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:21.430]  And I got all this news, all this world news, incredible things happening, but nothing is more important right now in the fight against the New World Order than exposing government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:09:24.002 --> 00:09:26.784]  Because if you expose that, you take their ace in the hole.
[00:09:26.885 --> 00:09:39.756]  You remove their main tool, their big engine, their big gun, where they stage attacks and get us to jump into their lap and beg us, you know, to give up our liberties and they'll protect us.
[00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:45.180]  Oh, it's for your own good.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:51.586]  And then we beg them to take our liberties and they'll protect us and it just goes on and on and on.
[00:09:53.303 --> 00:09:58.567]  So I did a lot of radio preparation last night, but I hadn't done much research this morning.
[00:09:58.787 --> 00:10:05.671]  I printed a bunch of news about 7 this morning and then I waddled on out the front door over to the university at 9am.
[00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:11.015]  Then I walk into the office about 10 minutes before I go on air.
[00:10:12.416 --> 00:10:14.838]  I'm trying to compose myself because it makes me really mad.
[00:10:14.858 --> 00:10:19.501]  You know when you get so mad you're not even yelling and screaming, you're just disgusted?
[00:10:22.062 --> 00:10:25.523]  You're just disgusted by all the big mouths that are around you.
[00:10:26.503 --> 00:10:33.564]  I mean, I got a big mouth, but I know what I'm talking about, and I'm careful about what I talk about when I'm on air to not damage our operations against the New World Order.
[00:10:37.205 --> 00:10:45.647]  I mean, I know so many things, and I intend to keep those things secret so I can learn even more, and to not spoil people's confidence.
[00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:50.508]  I just thought of this.
[00:10:53.587 --> 00:11:00.109]  But I need to, I'll talk about it during the break, with folks here at the office.
[00:11:01.789 --> 00:11:12.852]  But let me just get into the article first, because the article itself is a disgusting junior high level hit piece with no facts or info, and it's not going to work by Rupert Murdoch's New York Post.
[00:11:15.593 --> 00:11:21.014]  But then, the hit piece is secondary in my view, but it's important to address, to just
[00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:37.917]  The big-mouthed behavior that people engage in because I'm only involved in this film on the periphery and I'm honored to be and I want to be involved in this and just to see this happen disgusts me.
[00:11:41.038 --> 00:11:47.541]  You know Charlie Sheen originally just wanted to have a film festival out in Los Angeles when he contacted me
[00:11:50.316 --> 00:12:17.790]  Early in 2006, about a month before he went on air, and I was shocked by his high level of knowledge of 9-11 and many other political issues around the world, and just, you know, he's a very intelligent, very gentlemanly, very focused, genteel person, and then totally flew in the face of, you know, the stereotype
[00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:30.373]  And Charlie Sheen was saying, you know, it'd be interesting to make a 9-11 film, you know, to actually go out and produce one.
[00:12:31.753 --> 00:12:36.655]  And he wanted me to be a consultant in that capacity.
[00:12:37.455 --> 00:12:49.220]  And then over time, at his house, we discussed the idea of, well, you could just take loose change and work with those guys and update it.
[00:12:50.283 --> 00:12:51.424]  I don't know.
[00:12:51.444 --> 00:12:52.005]  I don't think so.
[00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:21.307]  And a nice fellow, I had a chance to meet him quite a few times, get to know him.
[00:13:22.828 --> 00:13:27.312]  And so I'm sitting here for the last year plus keeping my mouth shut.
[00:13:28.693 --> 00:13:37.119]  And I'm here just happy to see that something's being made and something's being done and something's being developed and something's being put forward.
[00:13:39.721 --> 00:13:44.285]  And then you have the mega big mouth
[00:13:46.207 --> 00:13:56.649]  Who a year ago I had, or less than a year ago, I had the June 9-11 Neoconagentist Symposium, which was originally Charlie's idea, but it kind of grew, and he wanted speakers, and we had speakers.
[00:13:57.289 --> 00:14:10.272]  And that's why I did it out in LA, that's why I did the symposium, was really it was Charlie Sheen's idea, and I respected him for going public, and then by doing that, C-SPAN covered it, and then the C-SPAN was aired a record four times, C-SPAN admitted it's most highly viewed,
[00:14:11.072 --> 00:14:12.873]  Uh, you know, two hours ever.
[00:14:13.373 --> 00:14:15.694]  Most highly, they sold more DVDs of it.
[00:14:15.734 --> 00:14:16.595]  They got more requests.
[00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:17.655]  It stayed on their main page.
[00:14:17.835 --> 00:14:19.176]  It's whatever gets watched the most online.
[00:14:19.296 --> 00:14:20.197]  It stays on their main page.
[00:14:20.457 --> 00:14:21.497]  It stayed there for over a month.
[00:14:21.517 --> 00:14:26.339]  I mean, you know, speeches of Ahmed Dineja to stay up there two days.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.580]  Or, you know, Bush a week.
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:34.603]  But, um, we're there just bouncing this off, you know, people's brains.
[00:14:35.924 --> 00:14:36.744]  Bouncing it off each other.
[00:14:36.784 --> 00:14:37.505]  Having ideas.
[00:14:37.905 --> 00:14:39.166]  The loose change guys are there.
[00:14:39.226 --> 00:14:39.766]  Dylan Avery.
[00:14:41.042 --> 00:15:09.847]  and uh... one of the speakers we had at the event was there hearing all this and by the time he was done with it he went and told page six that there was going to be a movie made about him which wasn't the case but you know somebody says you can make a movie about me and people go yeah that'd be interesting well that isn't people making a movie about you and certainly I hope people do and uh... then that's in page six
[00:15:12.791 --> 00:15:19.293]  And then, after that, I've got to be careful about what I do say here.
[00:15:19.313 --> 00:15:20.613]  I'm just so mad.
[00:15:22.333 --> 00:15:29.155]  Time goes on and things move forward nicely and I'm not going to get into any details about what's going on right now.
[00:15:30.155 --> 00:15:40.238]  And then I find out Monday, I find out Monday from the Loose Change crew that they were at a 9-11 event and this particular individual was there.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:48.043]  And that they told him, and I said, my God, that's going to be in page six.
[00:15:48.843 --> 00:16:00.047]  So I called up the producer on the project, and I told him, I said, you're not going to be able to control this now.
[00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:00.988]  It's going to leak out.
[00:16:02.028 --> 00:16:02.768]  I said, that's it.
[00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:06.850]  I said, within days, it will be in the newspaper.
[00:16:09.198 --> 00:16:25.929]  And now I pretty much, because I am, it's important to me to not blow people's cover or what they're doing in this movement, so now I pretty much have to talk about this so that the party can be contacted and admit that they are the ones, and there's no doubt in my mind, that put this out.
[00:16:26.917 --> 00:16:28.578]  And it's also a good example for people.
[00:16:28.598 --> 00:16:29.919]  You know, I tell people to work around me.
[00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:34.882]  You know, when the press calls up for me, or you're talking to the press and they ask questions about me, just don't answer it.
[00:16:35.262 --> 00:16:36.803]  Because you don't know how they'll twist.
[00:16:37.123 --> 00:16:38.124]  You don't know what they'll say.
[00:16:38.404 --> 00:16:41.986]  If somebody wants to call and interview you, that's fine.
[00:16:42.026 --> 00:16:43.847]  You go do a story about you with them.
[00:16:44.568 --> 00:16:44.908]  Okay?
[00:16:45.168 --> 00:16:48.030]  But stories about me, let me speak about myself.
[00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.251]  I have my reasons.
[00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:50.532]  Let me talk to the media.
[00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:53.213]  Not that I'm some master of it, but I'm better than most.
[00:16:55.235 --> 00:16:55.375]  And...
[00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:02.473]  It just makes my blood boil that I was brought in from the beginning in confidence in this.
[00:17:08.817 --> 00:17:10.538]  I hope this doesn't damage it.
[00:17:10.978 --> 00:17:14.421]  I hope this doesn't put heat on the project that needed to grow secretly.
[00:17:15.782 --> 00:17:18.564]  But undoubtedly it probably will.
[00:17:19.825 --> 00:17:21.606]  But we just have to push to make sure it is produced.
[00:17:22.242 --> 00:17:26.984]  But in a way, getting publicity now means that if it doesn't get made with one venue, it's going to get made somewhere else.
[00:17:27.344 --> 00:17:29.104]  So you never know how the dice are going to roll.
[00:17:29.124 --> 00:17:36.787]  I guess sometimes you can help nudge them, but you never know where the ball is going to drop in the roulette wheel.
[00:17:40.508 --> 00:17:41.008]  I'm going to control.
[00:17:41.048 --> 00:17:41.968]  I'm not going to blow up.
[00:17:42.609 --> 00:17:43.489]  I'm not going to blow up.
[00:17:44.209 --> 00:17:47.010]  In fact, it's not good that I got this literally ten minutes before I went on air.
[00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:51.802]  But some celebrities don't know when to keep their traps shut.
[00:17:51.842 --> 00:17:53.182]  This is the New York Post.
[00:17:53.623 --> 00:18:03.866]  Some celebrities don't know when to keep their traps shut, like Charlie Sheen and Rosie O'Donnell, who are throwing their weight behind the twisted theory that the United States government was behind the 9-11 terror attacks.
[00:18:04.206 --> 00:18:12.848]  Page Six has learned that Sheen, the hooker-loving Hollywood hunk, has agreed to narrate a new version of the Loopy YouTube documentary.
[00:18:13.228 --> 00:18:14.529]  No, it was not on YouTube.
[00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.909]  It was on
[00:18:16.545 --> 00:18:17.566]  Google a year before that.
[00:18:17.926 --> 00:18:18.567]  Loose change.
[00:18:19.788 --> 00:18:24.292]  Which claims that a corrupt faction within the federal government orchestrated the mass murder at the World Trade Center.
[00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:27.935]  Sources say Sheen, whose father, Martin Sheen, has been arrested 63 times.
[00:18:28.675 --> 00:18:30.557]  Oh, how dare him for, you know, causes.
[00:18:30.597 --> 00:18:31.498]  How dare him be involved?
[00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:44.148]  Sources say Sheen, whose father, Martin Sheen, has been arrested 63 times, protesting on behalf of various leftist causes, is in talks with Dallas Mavericks owner, Mark Cuban, who owns 2929, I would add,
[00:18:45.643 --> 00:18:51.886]  Of magnolia pitchers who distribute loose change, Sheen has called for a new independent probe of the attack.
[00:18:53.507 --> 00:19:04.773]  Telling Alex Jones Radio Show, it seems to me that 19 amateurs with box cutters taking over four commercial airliners and hitting 75% of their targets, that feels like a conspiracy theory.
[00:19:05.073 --> 00:19:06.234]  It raises a lot of questions.
[00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:08.935]  Sheen's rep confirmed his participation.
[00:19:09.821 --> 00:19:16.964]  Cuban emailed us saying, we are having discussions and distributing the existing video with Charlie's involvement as a narrator, not in making a new feature.
[00:19:17.484 --> 00:19:20.605]  We are also looking for productions with an opposing viewpoint.
[00:19:20.665 --> 00:19:25.327]  We like controversial subjects, but we are agnostic to which side of the controversy comes from.
[00:19:26.687 --> 00:19:32.369]  Meanwhile, on her blog, O'Donnell, now this is the good news, it finally broke with O'Donnell in a major publication.
[00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:33.550]  We'll come back and tell you.
[00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.150]  So there's silver linings in all of this.
[00:19:37.811 --> 00:19:38.072]  But I'm 95
[00:19:39.733 --> 00:19:42.394]  I'm more than that, but let's just say 95% I know who leaked this.
[00:19:42.954 --> 00:19:44.095]  Shame on you if you didn't.
[00:19:45.615 --> 00:19:46.275]  Shame on you!
[00:19:48.556 --> 00:19:55.078]  I mean, just... People get giddy though with movies and stuff and Hollywood stars.
[00:19:55.979 --> 00:19:56.759]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:20:01.514 --> 00:20:04.396]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:07.619]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:14.043]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:20:14.424 --> 00:20:21.749]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:25.972]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:31.816]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[00:20:32.016 --> 00:20:45.145]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.

[00:20:57.412 --> 00:21:07.134]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:07.594 --> 00:21:15.375]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:15.715 --> 00:21:23.557]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:23.877 --> 00:21:28.641]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:28.981 --> 00:21:33.705]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:34.206 --> 00:21:38.069]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:39.570]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.713]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:21:57.522 --> 00:22:03.424]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:03.924 --> 00:22:08.145]  Did you know that the United Nations Charter outlines a path to world tyranny?
[00:22:08.706 --> 00:22:14.388]  Did you know that the United Nations is building its own army to enforce its will upon the world?
[00:22:14.968 --> 00:22:21.070]  Did you know that they've empowered themselves to cross sovereign nations' borders without consent with their armies?
[00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:32.294]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:01.437 --> 00:23:03.479]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:13.046]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:13.487 --> 00:23:20.713]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:21.413 --> 00:23:22.474]  But now, it's
[00:23:25.151 --> 00:23:25.731]  Thank you.
[00:23:48.626 --> 00:23:49.126]  We're good.
[00:24:20.836 --> 00:24:22.177]  Welcome back.
[00:24:22.398 --> 00:24:28.083]  Now let's get into the shoddiness of the hit piece here.
[00:24:48.798 --> 00:24:53.159]  Meanwhile, this is page six, biggest gossip column in the country, New York Post.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:25:06.684]  Meanwhile, on her blog, O'Donnell has pasted in a widely debunked rundown of the collapse of Seven World Trade Center from WhatReallyHappened.com website, created by conspiracy theorist Matt Rivero.
[00:25:07.104 --> 00:25:08.865]  It's Michael Rivero.
[00:25:10.705 --> 00:25:12.666]  Michael Rivero, another Genesis host.
[00:25:13.046 --> 00:25:14.246]  They've got two Genesis hosts here.
[00:25:14.666 --> 00:25:16.507]  Michael Rivero and Alex Jones in this article.
[00:25:17.157 --> 00:25:18.476]  There goes John O'Donnell!
[00:25:20.186 --> 00:25:29.952]  Repeats his discredited theories, which include the notion that the fires, because the fires were not evenly distributed, it made the building perfect collapse into a footprint impossible.
[00:25:30.892 --> 00:25:36.355]  Landlord Larry Silverstein told the New York Fire Department that the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[00:25:36.835 --> 00:25:46.041]  A phrase conspiracy theorists take to mean that he ordered the skyscraper's destruction and that firefighters withdrawing from the building feared it was going to blow up.
[00:25:46.381 --> 00:25:48.262]  O'Donnell's rep declined comment.
[00:25:49.711 --> 00:25:51.612]  By the way, did anybody watch The View this morning?
[00:25:51.672 --> 00:25:56.333]  I was busy working, but she supposedly made a 9-11 comment.
[00:25:56.353 --> 00:25:57.093]  She's made several.
[00:25:57.593 --> 00:26:02.534]  Veiled ones, like screaming, 9-11's an inside job, 9-11's an inside job, 9-11's an inside job.
[00:26:02.574 --> 00:26:05.195]  Oh, that's what John Connor says, another Genesis host.
[00:26:05.795 --> 00:26:09.596]  You starting to get the idea of the effect we're having here, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:26:10.296 --> 00:26:16.458]  The responsibility we have as talk show hosts, the Patriot Movement, not just this network, but other networks having an effect?
[00:26:20.692 --> 00:26:23.993]  Do you realize the responsibility we have?
[00:26:26.294 --> 00:26:30.176]  The responsibility we have to stay focused and on serious issues?
[00:26:33.297 --> 00:26:34.578]  They just keep saying discredited.
[00:26:34.598 --> 00:26:35.558]  They say discredited what?
[00:26:35.598 --> 00:26:36.178]  Three times.
[00:26:37.219 --> 00:26:39.720]  The government official story has been discredited.
[00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:49.837]  And FEMA have had to withdraw the five separate reasons that they had previously claimed Building 7 fell.
[00:26:50.038 --> 00:26:52.180]  They would give one reason, fuel tank blew up.
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:59.186]  Then they give another reason, North Tower fell into it and knocked a big chunk out of it, and then they show a picture of another building.
[00:27:01.036 --> 00:27:03.797]  And then, oh, it was structurally not built right.
[00:27:03.817 --> 00:27:06.278]  And, oh, it was on and on.
[00:27:06.298 --> 00:27:07.639]  And the sprinkler system didn't go off.
[00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:10.180]  And then all the engineers were going to go, well, that's not why that happened.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:15.963]  I mean, underwriting laboratories did a study of Tower 1, 2, and 7 and found 7 was impossible.
[00:27:17.083 --> 00:27:19.424]  And the others, very, very unlikely.
[00:27:19.444 --> 00:27:25.187]  And they couldn't, in models, in a year-long test, show how it could even be weakened.
[00:27:27.412 --> 00:27:31.415]  And then their engineer who learned about it goes public and they fire Kevin Ryan.
[00:27:31.435 --> 00:27:35.317]  He was the head of a whole division of underwriting laboratories.
[00:27:36.478 --> 00:27:41.081]  Laboratories, as the redcoats say.
[00:27:43.082 --> 00:27:46.184]  So, I don't know how to deal with this anymore.
[00:27:47.545 --> 00:27:49.626]  I mean, this is just ridiculous!
[00:27:50.808 --> 00:28:02.652]  I could go on for hours and play firefighters and police saying, get back, they're going to blow it up, it's going to come down, and play firefighters and police on record saying we were told to get back, the government was going to bring it down, control demolition to save the other buildings.
[00:28:03.032 --> 00:28:14.416]  In the PBS documentary, Larry Silverstein says that they didn't want it to damage the other buildings, that's what the other engineers were saying, and then he says we made the decision to pull it and they gave the order and we watched the building come down.
[00:28:14.736 --> 00:28:16.377]  And then they say that meant firefighters.
[00:28:16.597 --> 00:28:17.617]  Firefighters were never in it.
[00:28:17.657 --> 00:28:18.678]  They were never told to fight it.
[00:28:19.018 --> 00:28:21.739]  They were told to get out that morning, that it was going to come down later.
[00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:23.559]  They got out, fire started, and it fell down.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:30.242]  BBC came out and said it had fallen 20-something minutes before it did.
[00:28:30.762 --> 00:28:32.062]  So did Aaron Brown of CNN.
[00:28:34.443 --> 00:28:35.544]  Now that's the bottom line.
[00:28:38.085 --> 00:28:38.865]  That's the bottom line.
[00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:44.729]  And I, for one, have had enough.
[00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:48.250]  And I'm not going to get mad.
[00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:50.891]  I'm just going to expose these people.
[00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:53.532]  So, Paul Watson's listening right now.
[00:28:53.572 --> 00:28:54.752]  He's already written one article today.
[00:28:54.772 --> 00:28:55.833]  His brother's already written an article.
[00:28:55.853 --> 00:28:59.914]  But I'm telling him right now, over there in England, it's 530 over there right now, 528.
[00:29:00.554 --> 00:29:01.014]  I want you to
[00:29:10.658 --> 00:29:14.481]  Basically, just succinctly say, yeah, this leaked out, you know, it's not good.
[00:29:15.241 --> 00:29:17.103]  Whatever basics, but that's a side issue.
[00:29:17.183 --> 00:29:18.163]  Now for the debunking.
[00:29:18.384 --> 00:29:37.437]  So we need a headline that's a combo headline that, you know, that basically states, uh, pathetic attempt to discredit 9-11 truthers and Building 7 O'Donnell Sheen, and then under it, uh, you know, leaker, you know, exposes secret project.
[00:29:38.398 --> 00:29:40.019]  And then you can have some comments about the
[00:29:41.486 --> 00:29:42.727]  Sniveling fool!
[00:29:43.967 --> 00:29:46.468]  Then we can get into debunking the debunkers.
[00:29:46.488 --> 00:29:47.248]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:52.590]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:54.651]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.551 --> 00:29:58.332]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.313 --> 00:30:07.335]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:30:07.876 --> 00:30:09.036]  Globalists are concerned with
[00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:14.290]  We're good to go.
[00:30:34.717 --> 00:30:34.997]  I think so.
[00:31:00.877 --> 00:31:07.544]  Thus says Yahweh, if you will not keep my commandments by violating my covenant, I will bring upon you sudden terror!
[00:31:11.405 --> 00:31:14.568]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[00:31:14.808 --> 00:31:18.492]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[00:31:18.772 --> 00:31:26.720]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.
[00:31:27.101 --> 00:31:29.843]  Get to Witness Ministries' next shocking revelation.
[00:31:30.124 --> 00:31:33.327]  The Rider of the White Horse, George W. Bush in Prophecy.

[00:31:36.768 --> 00:31:41.169]  King George II beats the war drums for his next invasion, Iran and Syria.
[00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:44.570]  More nations are to follow, including the draft of your children.
[00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:53.752]  With a $25 love offering to Two Witness Ministries, get the book, The Rider of the White Horse, at Box 2453, Abilene, Texas, 79604.
[00:31:54.873 --> 00:31:58.854]  Unless she repents, America will not survive the Red Horse of World War III.
[00:32:01.104 --> 00:32:03.725]  The future of our world is very uncertain.
[00:32:04.205 --> 00:32:10.027]  Hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, and acts of terrorism are a fact of life.
[00:32:10.808 --> 00:32:13.989]  Natural or man-made disasters can strike at any time.
[00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:21.257]  You and your family should be prepared for the inevitable disaster with an ample stock of food, water, shelter and supplies.

[00:32:35.845 --> 00:32:36.225]  We're good to go.
[00:33:04.505 --> 00:33:05.005]  Don't worry.
[00:33:05.465 --> 00:33:07.006]  This show is documented.
[00:33:07.526 --> 00:33:10.208]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.688 --> 00:33:14.209]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:14.629 --> 00:33:18.731]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:33:18.751 --> 00:33:23.613]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[00:33:24.454 --> 00:33:26.955]  The ring of fire.
[00:33:27.115 --> 00:33:31.517]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[00:33:32.357 --> 00:33:34.959]  You know, I learned about this 10 minutes before I went on air.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.122]  And so, everything I said may not be exact.
[00:33:38.162 --> 00:33:40.464]  In fact, that was a conversation Monday.
[00:33:40.524 --> 00:33:46.328]  I talked to the Louis Change crew, talked to Jason Burmiss, and then I talked to Eric, who's a producer.
[00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:47.589]  That's all I'm going to say.
[00:33:47.689 --> 00:33:50.131]  And then, I just talked to Burmiss, and it's correct.
[00:33:50.171 --> 00:33:51.913]  It was not the Louis Change guys.
[00:33:52.353 --> 00:33:53.274]  Let's make that clear.
[00:33:53.594 --> 00:34:01.220]  I knew that they were there at the meeting, where this individual was at a 9-11 event, or a Patriot event, and learned a little bit about it.
[00:34:02.202 --> 00:34:06.467]  And so it wasn't them, it was somebody else who heard about it that told them.
[00:34:07.388 --> 00:34:10.231]  And again, it's got rays of silver lining.
[00:34:10.431 --> 00:34:12.133]  The Rosie O'Donnell thing is out now.
[00:34:12.153 --> 00:34:15.056]  I guess the media couldn't control themselves.
[00:34:15.076 --> 00:34:21.884]  I mean, Limbaugh commented on it last Friday, but just said, yeah, 9-11 nut like Rosie O'Donnell when she'd just gone public that day.
[00:34:22.862 --> 00:34:32.613]  She done a kind of a preliminary comment on Tuesday but then Friday really on public within hours Limbaugh's on air attacking her just saying how that 9-11 nut Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:40.186]  And then, of course, I got a call from Talk Radio Network's Man Cow to go on Monday and talk about O'Donnell.
[00:34:40.206 --> 00:34:43.589]  And I'm trying to push it to get attention because it will cause a whole new firestorm.
[00:34:43.609 --> 00:34:47.032]  And again, I wouldn't even be involved in that.
[00:34:47.252 --> 00:34:48.913]  It's not about getting attention for the show.
[00:34:49.234 --> 00:34:53.538]  I like to do that because we get a bigger audience to reach more people and then cause bigger domino effects.
[00:34:53.718 --> 00:34:54.879]  But it's all the war.
[00:34:54.979 --> 00:34:56.100]  It's all the info war.
[00:34:57.137 --> 00:35:01.078]  But no, I just wanted to blow up, big for Rosie O'Donnell, 9-11 Truth itself.
[00:35:01.539 --> 00:35:09.881]  You know, when Charlie Sheen went public, every 9-11 site for two months reported that they had double or triple their readership.
[00:35:11.302 --> 00:35:12.302]  I did too, by the way.
[00:35:12.983 --> 00:35:16.264]  And, again, I could have some other Hollywood star on before, and I have.
[00:35:16.944 --> 00:35:18.584]  And, you know, it's huge.
[00:35:18.845 --> 00:35:21.245]  And it doesn't do anything because it's not the controversy.
[00:35:21.746 --> 00:35:23.206]  That controversy took off.
[00:35:23.706 --> 00:35:25.767]  It was a selfless act by Charlie Sheen.
[00:35:28.032 --> 00:35:36.325]  And I can only commend him for what he did, and I truly just want to see
[00:35:37.859 --> 00:35:46.461]  The Loose Chains crew make their final edition and see it in stores everywhere and see it on and you know go down and promote it and and and you know see it at a local theater.
[00:35:46.521 --> 00:35:47.541]  I want to go to the premiere.
[00:35:48.141 --> 00:35:55.963]  I literally just want to be able to be part of history and believe me putting something like that in theaters will be unprecedented.
[00:35:56.003 --> 00:35:59.483]  There has never been any film as radical shown in theaters.
[00:35:59.804 --> 00:36:06.825]  This makes Citizen Kane look like baby food compared to a moonshine, White Lightning.
[00:36:07.541 --> 00:36:08.041]  Everclear.
[00:36:08.782 --> 00:36:11.223]  I mean, this is baby food compared to Everclear.
[00:36:11.884 --> 00:36:17.187]  I mean, this is rocket fuel, ladies and gentlemen, and it's a very serious production house.
[00:36:18.207 --> 00:36:24.571]  You know, Mark Cuban's a multi-billionaire, sold some huge site to, what, Yahoo back in the late 90s.
[00:36:24.671 --> 00:36:35.457]  He's made some big movies, distributed big movies, and I've known about this since before its inception, and I've kept my mouth shut.
[00:36:36.255 --> 00:36:40.237]  And when I heard that the big mouth had learned of this, I went, that's it!
[00:36:41.278 --> 00:36:41.858]  That's it!
[00:36:41.958 --> 00:36:43.719]  It's going to be in the New York Post.
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.780]  And why did I know it would be in the New York Post?
[00:36:46.541 --> 00:36:55.786]  Because that's where the individual, and again, I may be wrong about this, I doubt it, I am, that's where the individual last time heard about just a plan to make a movie, period, about 9-11.
[00:36:56.106 --> 00:36:56.947]  We weren't even sure.
[00:36:57.267 --> 00:36:58.928]  It just morphed into the loose change thing.
[00:36:59.208 --> 00:37:00.489]  And then they took the ball and ran with it.
[00:37:00.549 --> 00:37:01.069]  I'm glad.
[00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.791]  Again, folks, they're building FEMA camps.
[00:37:04.831 --> 00:37:05.832]  We must defeat them.
[00:37:07.765 --> 00:37:08.685]  I go to bed every night.
[00:37:08.725 --> 00:37:11.746]  I went to bed last night about midnight because I had to get up real early.
[00:37:13.067 --> 00:37:15.867]  And as I went to bed I thought we were in a race.
[00:37:15.927 --> 00:37:17.608]  I've got to beat them for my children's future.
[00:37:17.648 --> 00:37:19.528]  I thought about the children sleeping down the hall.
[00:37:20.148 --> 00:37:21.149]  I thought about my wife.
[00:37:22.149 --> 00:37:23.729]  I thought we've got to beat these people.
[00:37:23.769 --> 00:37:24.490]  This is a race.
[00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:26.210]  We've got to expose they staged the attack.
[00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:27.731]  So they're going to use it for martial law.
[00:37:28.131 --> 00:37:29.111]  As they've announced they'll do.
[00:37:30.799 --> 00:37:31.639]  We're going to go to Debbie Morrow.
[00:37:31.659 --> 00:37:32.340]  Debbie, I know you're holding.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.181]  This has just really upset me.
[00:37:34.421 --> 00:37:36.341]  We're going to get back into this and then your calls.
[00:37:36.442 --> 00:37:39.363]  Debbie, I haven't had her on in weeks and weeks.
[00:37:39.383 --> 00:37:40.263]  It's been like a month.
[00:37:40.723 --> 00:37:42.424]  Debbie Morrow of New Millennium Concepts.
[00:37:42.464 --> 00:37:43.485]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:37:43.805 --> 00:37:44.605]  Hi there, Alex.
[00:37:44.665 --> 00:37:45.846]  Thank you for having me.
[00:37:45.886 --> 00:37:49.607]  Actually, I was very interested in listening to what you were talking about.
[00:37:49.627 --> 00:37:53.609]  I was reading your website earlier this week.
[00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:59.752]  It's just very important to keep movies that are in development secret.
[00:38:00.524 --> 00:38:04.707]  Okay, especially something like this that will be the most controversial film to ever hit theaters.
[00:38:05.467 --> 00:38:07.208]  And it probably goes supernova.
[00:38:07.669 --> 00:38:08.009]  Okay?
[00:38:08.049 --> 00:38:11.411]  And it isn't about making the money, but you measure how many people you get to buy it.
[00:38:11.852 --> 00:38:13.393]  And of course, I did probably end up making nothing.
[00:38:13.433 --> 00:38:14.513]  I'm just on the periphery of this.
[00:38:14.533 --> 00:38:17.775]  Some of my footage is going to be in it, and some other things.
[00:38:17.815 --> 00:38:21.538]  But the point is, the Loose Change crew are listening right now, but they said they can't comment.
[00:38:21.738 --> 00:38:24.500]  They're welcome to call in and just talk about what's in the article if they want.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.881]  Yeah.
[00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:30.971]  It's just such a delicate thing.
[00:38:31.031 --> 00:38:32.572]  It's an embryonic stage.
[00:38:32.592 --> 00:38:36.375]  You know, a baby, once it comes out of the womb, is pretty strong and resilient.
[00:38:36.415 --> 00:38:41.199]  But when a baby is two months old, it's very delicate and needs to stay in the womb.
[00:38:41.939 --> 00:38:43.000]  Right.
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.501]  But I think this is going to turn out for the best.
[00:38:44.561 --> 00:38:45.742]  I think it's going to be okay.
[00:38:45.842 --> 00:38:47.444]  Just sorry, Debbie, go ahead.
[00:38:47.964 --> 00:38:48.985]  Oh, that's okay.
[00:38:49.465 --> 00:38:52.888]  I was glad to actually be able to listen in.
[00:38:53.667 --> 00:39:14.011]  And we've had a lot of good response to your listeners about the Berkey water filters and we wanted to, you know, come on today and just remind people how important it is that they get their Berkey water filters and start using them before something happens and that our lines are open and available and that we have all kinds of Alex Jones specials.
[00:39:14.411 --> 00:39:18.592]  We've been getting a lot of response to the five Berkey sport bottles for $99.
[00:39:21.003 --> 00:39:29.006]  If those are normally $35-$34, I've looked at the Kammock Supply Stores and the element is only a third the size of the element you have.
[00:39:29.346 --> 00:39:33.968]  This is 600 plus refills of tap water, 100 and something of swamp water, as bad as it gets.
[00:39:35.388 --> 00:39:37.129]  These are great for the office, the gym, whatever.
[00:39:37.429 --> 00:39:42.971]  What percentage off is that then if they're $15 off each unit when you get five of them?
[00:39:43.311 --> 00:39:47.973]  Right, because you're getting them for $19.80 each, I think.
[00:39:48.013 --> 00:39:48.253]  Yeah.
[00:39:49.073 --> 00:39:51.174]  So that is a really big saving.
[00:39:51.194 --> 00:39:52.274]  Well, I know what that is.
[00:39:52.474 --> 00:39:53.335]  That's 45% off.
[00:39:53.535 --> 00:39:54.815]  Yeah, that's really good.
[00:39:54.895 --> 00:39:55.316]  No, it's not.
[00:39:55.356 --> 00:39:55.636]  It's 55% off.
[00:39:58.157 --> 00:39:59.038]  No, no, no.
[00:39:59.138 --> 00:39:59.978]  The first one's right.
[00:40:00.018 --> 00:40:00.798]  Forty-five percent off.
[00:40:00.818 --> 00:40:01.178]  There we go.
[00:40:01.298 --> 00:40:04.140]  Yeah, so we want to encourage people to get those.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:10.122]  And, of course, the Berkey gravity water filter systems are, you know, really fantastic.
[00:40:10.202 --> 00:40:20.286]  And we've had a lot of people call in recently who've been checking the alkalinity of their water after they Berkey it.
[00:40:20.406 --> 00:40:22.607]  And they've discovered that the alkalinity
[00:40:23.768 --> 00:40:28.257]  Water becomes more alkaline as you burpee it, which is a good thing.
[00:40:28.277 --> 00:40:30.983]  It kind of brings it up to a 6.5 and a 7.
[00:40:31.645 --> 00:40:33.488]  And, you know, for health reasons,
[00:40:34.062 --> 00:40:41.928]  That's a very good thing, you know, to have your mineralized water so that things like cancer can't grow as readily in your body.
[00:40:42.709 --> 00:40:49.174]  And so we also, not only for emergency, but for health reasons, the Berkeys are really a great way to go.
[00:40:49.374 --> 00:40:56.399]  And we have a lot of Alex Jones specials, you know, like if they get a Berkey light, they get a free sport bottle with it.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.822]  Or if they get a big Berkey, they get a sport bottle.
[00:40:59.862 --> 00:41:00.743]  Or if they get two
[00:41:01.443 --> 00:41:04.824]  You know, a four filter system, then they can get two sport bottles.
[00:41:04.924 --> 00:41:14.207]  So, you know, I just wanted to call in and say hi to everybody, because it has been a while, and also encourage people to give me a call.
[00:41:14.227 --> 00:41:18.369]  The lines are open and we can take your orders and get you shipped by Monday.
[00:41:19.151 --> 00:41:19.731]  Absolutely.
[00:41:19.751 --> 00:41:21.552]  You guys ship out via UPS Ground.
[00:41:21.572 --> 00:41:27.395]  They can call you guys directly at 888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com.
[00:41:27.696 --> 00:41:30.237]  Be sure in the comments section to tell them it's an Alex Jones special.
[00:41:30.457 --> 00:41:41.463]  Because let's say you order the $195 basic Berkey that cuts everything out, all the toxic bacteria, the chemicals, all that stuff, but leaves the good minerals in.
[00:41:42.243 --> 00:41:42.684]  We're good to go!
[00:42:05.685 --> 00:42:07.166]  And it lasts for like 20 years, folks.
[00:42:07.186 --> 00:42:08.226]  You just put it in your medicine shelf.
[00:42:08.286 --> 00:42:10.467]  If there's ever a radiological event, you take this.
[00:42:10.547 --> 00:42:18.651]  It blocks the number one cause of death, which is thyroid absorption of the particular isotopes, causing the gland to literally die and rot in your body.
[00:42:18.971 --> 00:42:19.712]  So, I mean, it's just good.
[00:42:20.032 --> 00:42:20.692]  I got this stuff.
[00:42:20.712 --> 00:42:23.554]  I mean, I got like 20 bottles of this in the preparedness area.
[00:42:23.594 --> 00:42:24.934]  I gave it all to friends and family.
[00:42:25.234 --> 00:42:28.396]  I got a couple of Berkeys in the garage, a Berkey in the house, a Berkey at the office.
[00:42:28.416 --> 00:42:29.436]  I got backup Berkeys.
[00:42:29.796 --> 00:42:31.197]  I got two years' food supply.
[00:42:31.217 --> 00:42:33.158]  And it's just an insurance, you know?
[00:42:33.238 --> 00:42:34.319]  It's basic insurance.
[00:42:35.539 --> 00:42:38.983]  I live in the city, but I've got bug-out routes and a map in each car.
[00:42:39.043 --> 00:42:43.827]  Different routes and roads are shut down, which the government says they'll do during disasters, to get around these people.
[00:42:43.847 --> 00:42:45.088]  They try to stop me and have me help them.
[00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:49.372]  And I've got bug-out zones in three different directions I can go to.
[00:42:49.653 --> 00:42:51.034]  And again, it's not because I'm living in fear.
[00:42:51.134 --> 00:42:52.435]  I'm living empowered.
[00:42:52.816 --> 00:42:55.458]  I'm living to try to be in control, to defend my family.
[00:42:55.798 --> 00:42:57.180]  That is my responsibility.
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.562]  But forget emergencies, folks.
[00:42:59.842 --> 00:43:01.724]  The water is an emergency right now.
[00:43:01.784 --> 00:43:02.865]  Herbicides, pesticides.
[00:43:02.945 --> 00:43:04.166]  I can't go over the hundreds of things.
[00:43:04.266 --> 00:43:05.347]  Arsenic, lead, mercury.
[00:43:05.787 --> 00:43:07.909]  Give Debbie a call right now.
[00:43:07.929 --> 00:43:07.969]  888-803-4438.
[00:43:07.989 --> 00:43:08.089]  888-803-4438.
[00:43:08.109 --> 00:43:08.149]  888-803-4438.
[00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:09.190]  Or Berkeywater.com.
[00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.092]  Or order right off the Secure Online Shopping Cart.
[00:43:20.891 --> 00:43:22.232]  At InfoWars.com.
[00:43:22.252 --> 00:43:23.473]  I'm so mad I can hardly talk.
[00:43:23.874 --> 00:43:25.135]  At InfoWars.com.
[00:43:25.695 --> 00:43:30.099]  And tell us what free gift you want as well right there and we'll get that sent out to you as well.
[00:43:30.119 --> 00:43:31.660]  We just give them the order and they send it to you.
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.122]  Debbie, as always, it's great talking to you.
[00:43:34.142 --> 00:43:35.043]  How are your children doing?
[00:43:35.063 --> 00:43:35.843]  How's your life going?
[00:43:36.184 --> 00:43:37.605]  Everybody's doing great.
[00:43:37.685 --> 00:43:38.726]  Thank you very much.
[00:43:39.126 --> 00:43:45.952]  And speaking of children, I was going to mention when you said the bug out routes, my family has those too.
[00:43:46.012 --> 00:43:48.534]  And when that hurricane hit Houston last year,
[00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:51.772]  Um, and everybody, you know, wanted to leave Houston.
[00:43:52.273 --> 00:43:56.917]  Even with the bug out route, it took my daughter 14 hours to get from Houston to Dallas.
[00:43:57.858 --> 00:43:59.099]  And that was not on the freeway.
[00:43:59.119 --> 00:44:01.942]  And a lot of people just didn't get anywhere.
[00:44:01.982 --> 00:44:03.623]  Yeah, some people died on the freeway.
[00:44:03.943 --> 00:44:14.393]  People actually, some elderly people, um, actually, because of lack of water and being stuck on the freeway in that heat, actually passed away right in the cars.
[00:44:14.904 --> 00:44:18.765]  And I can't believe they didn't just ignore the police and just drive on the grass, do whatever they wanted to.
[00:44:18.805 --> 00:44:20.146]  They submitted and died.
[00:44:20.486 --> 00:44:21.706]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:44:21.946 --> 00:44:22.486]  Thank you.
[00:44:22.526 --> 00:44:23.447]  Take care, Alex.
[00:44:23.687 --> 00:44:24.427]  Thanks for having me.
[00:44:24.747 --> 00:44:25.607]  I appreciate you coming on.
[00:44:25.908 --> 00:44:28.528]  Now listen, here's an example.
[00:44:28.688 --> 00:44:38.532]  All over Texas and other areas I've been in the country, if you look in the last two years, they've been putting hardened, steel-enforced pylons in.
[00:44:39.732 --> 00:44:41.693]  I guess I'd call them stakes or posts, really.
[00:44:41.713 --> 00:44:42.553]  They're not pylons.
[00:44:43.211 --> 00:44:49.113]  You know, they're usually about four feet tall with huge, powerful, you know, inch-round cables.
[00:44:49.693 --> 00:44:53.074]  Double cables where you cannot get over the highway.
[00:44:53.894 --> 00:45:07.598]  And now they're putting them not just in between the medians on interstate highways and state roads, like 37 or I-35, now they're putting them in on the other sides where you're literally trapped on the roads.
[00:45:07.678 --> 00:45:11.919]  And I've seen Pentagon documents where they're going to use those to shut down cities and for total control.
[00:45:14.574 --> 00:45:26.040]  I mean it's just we're being totally corralled and they're also setting it up for the toll roads and people will cut off roads and cheat and do that kind of thing it's just it's just it's it's what they're doing now
[00:45:27.563 --> 00:45:29.385]  Let me just get back to this New York Post thing.
[00:45:29.405 --> 00:45:31.446]  We're going to be taking your calls throughout the broadcast today.
[00:45:31.466 --> 00:45:32.447]  It's wide open phones.
[00:45:32.467 --> 00:45:32.547]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:45:32.567 --> 00:45:32.627]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:45:32.647 --> 00:45:35.870]  And in case I was saying those numbers too fast, it's 888-803-4438 to get a big Berkey.
[00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:36.170]  All right.
[00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:39.093]  There are several new articles that have come out in the news.
[00:45:56.661 --> 00:46:06.084]  As well, now covering this as well, so there is now a domino effect.
[00:46:06.104 --> 00:46:17.248]  But I think they may have inadvertently, by trying to swat down this film, they may have let the Rosie O'Donnell thing out of the bag, because they got talking points for Limbaugh and others, and those are staged events.
[00:46:17.808 --> 00:46:21.409]  That whole tip between him and Schwarzenegger was staged, no doubt in my mind.
[00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:33.458]  But they don't control the local neocontroversial hosts who really think they're conservatives, and really think they're battling Al-Qaeda, and really think they're fighting for red, white, and blue.
[00:46:33.938 --> 00:46:40.363]  Those guys and gals aren't going to be able to control themselves, and they're all now going to talk about this today and tomorrow.
[00:46:42.024 --> 00:46:47.348]  You're going to hear about this today and tomorrow and throughout next week, and it officially broke through.
[00:46:48.469 --> 00:46:50.891]  So in a way, the big mouth who leaked this
[00:46:54.113 --> 00:46:55.654]  And I can say I have my suspicions.
[00:46:55.955 --> 00:47:00.859]  The person who leaked it to the same reporter before, when they didn't have the whole story, and the person that's done it again.
[00:47:00.899 --> 00:47:01.819]  But we don't know that.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.581]  I have my sneaking suspicions.
[00:47:06.503 --> 00:47:14.690]  Hollywood 9-11 Idiot Brigade, and it attacks Charlie Sheen, Martin Sheen, Mark Cuban, myself.
[00:47:17.813 --> 00:47:19.895]  Michael Rivero is now Matt Rivero.
[00:47:20.115 --> 00:47:21.456]  We need to get a retraction on that.
[00:47:23.914 --> 00:47:25.735]  Maybe we need to get Michael Rivero up.
[00:47:25.815 --> 00:47:26.495]  Hey, you know what?
[00:47:26.535 --> 00:47:28.416]  Let's do that in the middle of the next hour, if he can make it.
[00:47:28.717 --> 00:47:29.497]  He's out in Hawaii.
[00:47:29.537 --> 00:47:34.280]  I know he runs a special effects company, but let's... That's why I can see the tricks.
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.261]  I can see the fraud, the scams.
[00:47:38.502 --> 00:47:41.343]  Let's get him on for 10 minutes, if he can do it, just to pop in.
[00:47:41.684 --> 00:47:47.987]  I'm sure he's aware of this, but since his new name is Matt Rivero... By the way, O'Donnell linked to, like, 15 different sites.
[00:47:48.047 --> 00:47:53.030]  She linked to 9-11 Scholars and all these other organizations.
[00:47:54.497 --> 00:48:03.184]  She, uh, Journal of 9-11 Studies, and she did cut and paste some, you know, some comments about Rivero, because he does boil things down nicely.
[00:48:03.725 --> 00:48:07.208]  In fact, let's just read what O'Donnell had to say.
[00:48:07.228 --> 00:48:11.371]  You know, she went through these bullet points.
[00:48:19.899 --> 00:48:20.079]  Wow.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.140]  It goes on.
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:27.084]  Rosie O'Donnell, of course, has 30 million viewers a day.
[00:48:27.184 --> 00:48:28.406]  I said 25 million yesterday.
[00:48:28.446 --> 00:48:28.986]  I'm wrong.
[00:48:29.066 --> 00:48:29.567]  It's 30 million.
[00:48:30.948 --> 00:48:32.049]  On her best Nielsen day.
[00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:37.834]  And if she can be pushed out into the open to cover this,
[00:48:38.727 --> 00:48:43.049]  If it can become a big news cycle, Rosie O'Donnell is in the 9-11 truth.
[00:48:43.489 --> 00:48:45.069]  Tens of millions more will look at it.
[00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:48.731]  I mean, the globalists are already defeated when it comes to 9-11.
[00:48:49.191 --> 00:48:50.591]  In that battle, we've won that battle.
[00:48:50.611 --> 00:48:51.431]  We haven't won the war.
[00:48:51.451 --> 00:48:54.833]  84% of Americans, again, believe there's a cover-up.
[00:48:54.853 --> 00:48:58.014]  36%, that was an older poll, believe total inside job.
[00:48:58.034 --> 00:49:00.875]  68% in that same poll believe there's a government cover-up.
[00:49:01.795 --> 00:49:03.776]  So in early 2006, it was 68% believe there was a cover-up.
[00:49:03.796 --> 00:49:03.956]  In late 2006,
[00:49:09.212 --> 00:49:10.753]  84% believe there was a cover-up.
[00:49:11.673 --> 00:49:19.654]  In the first, I guess about a year ago now, 36% would say on the phone to a pollster, yeah, I believe it's a total inside job.
[00:49:20.615 --> 00:49:27.496]  I mean, there are very few people I can think of, even myself 10 years ago, probably wouldn't answer questions that hardcore to a pollster.
[00:49:28.516 --> 00:49:31.557]  The type of person that believes it's an inside job probably wouldn't talk to a pollster.
[00:49:31.817 --> 00:49:36.458]  Imagine Ohio University, Scripps Howard News Service, highly scientific poll, ring, ring,
[00:49:37.637 --> 00:49:38.857]  I think that came out, didn't it?
[00:49:39.037 --> 00:49:41.938]  It came out in March, or was it April?
[00:49:42.018 --> 00:49:42.779]  It was March of 2006.
[00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:46.240]  We can pull that up and look, but I'm pretty sure it was March.
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:47.940]  Maybe it was February, even.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:52.061]  And hey, I know it was in the spring or winter.
[00:49:52.902 --> 00:49:55.362]  And it's just incredible.
[00:49:56.063 --> 00:49:58.123]  Hey, do you believe the government carried out 9-11?
[00:49:58.303 --> 00:49:59.604]  Do you believe they had no involvement?
[00:50:00.304 --> 00:50:01.284]  Oh, I believe the government did it.
[00:50:01.304 --> 00:50:02.785]  Do you believe you're being lied to?
[00:50:02.805 --> 00:50:02.785]  68%.
[00:50:02.825 --> 00:50:05.085]  And then another 36% believe total inside job.
[00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:11.731]  I mean, that is an amazing number.
[00:50:12.512 --> 00:50:20.896]  Heck, if you combine 36 and 68... But how those polls are, they have multiple questions.
[00:50:21.617 --> 00:50:22.978]  So it doesn't come out to more than 100%.
[00:50:23.018 --> 00:50:26.379]  And again, that gets all off into polling science.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:31.142]  I'm going to try to get a hold of Charlie today.
[00:50:31.202 --> 00:50:35.184]  He shoots his TV show Fridays live.
[00:50:35.204 --> 00:50:39.467]  I mean, it's taped, but it's to a live audience, and they do a rehearsal Thursday.
[00:50:40.826 --> 00:50:53.904]  But, uh, I'm going to get a hold of him or his manager or his assistant and we're going to try to... I was going to wait to get him on to talk about this until they're going to launch the film and put it out.
[00:50:54.265 --> 00:50:55.366]  Maybe now's not the time.
[00:50:56.608 --> 00:50:57.209]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:04.568 --> 00:51:10.038]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.399 --> 00:51:18.012]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.726 --> 00:51:25.788]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.189 --> 00:51:37.652]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.912 --> 00:51:41.754]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.854 --> 00:51:43.814]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.135 --> 00:51:47.976]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.488 --> 00:52:06.691]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:06.851 --> 00:52:14.936]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:15.197 --> 00:52:22.241]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:22.421 --> 00:52:23.702]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[00:52:23.782 --> 00:52:29.686]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:29.887 --> 00:52:34.970]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:43.977]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.

[00:53:39.192 --> 00:53:40.233]  I think so.
[00:54:03.886 --> 00:54:21.131]  The creature man says it's the end of time And the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive The interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown
[00:54:26.813 --> 00:54:29.213]  I live back in the woods, you see.
[00:54:29.753 --> 00:54:37.135]  A woman and the kids and the dogs and me.
[00:54:37.295 --> 00:54:42.996]  I got a shotgun, a rifle and a four-wheel drive and a country boy can survive.
[00:54:43.456 --> 00:54:49.878]  Country folks can survive.
[00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:55.011]  I can plow a field all day long.
[00:54:55.112 --> 00:54:59.534]  I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn.
[00:55:00.694 --> 00:55:06.297]  We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too.
[00:55:06.397 --> 00:55:11.860]  Ain't too many things these old boys can't do.
[00:55:13.041 --> 00:55:19.864]  We grow good old tomatoes and homemade wine and country boy can survive.
[00:55:19.904 --> 00:55:21.245]  Country folks can
[00:55:27.325 --> 00:55:29.306]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:56.246]  All right, let's just take calls.
[00:55:56.286 --> 00:55:59.769]  O'Farrell's going to pop in briefly, give his take on this whole New York Post thing.
[00:56:00.289 --> 00:56:01.731]  But they think they're beating us.
[00:56:01.831 --> 00:56:02.491]  We're beating them.
[00:56:02.531 --> 00:56:04.713]  This O'Donnell thing is probably going to explode now.
[00:56:05.073 --> 00:56:06.815]  Need to go up to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:06.835 --> 00:56:08.396]  We need to get a Dig link ad there.
[00:56:08.436 --> 00:56:09.617]  They do have Dig enabled.
[00:56:09.938 --> 00:56:11.299]  We need to dig this story up.
[00:56:11.779 --> 00:56:14.582]  And the neocons are going to dig it, too, because they're going to think it's a hit piece.
[00:56:14.602 --> 00:56:15.182]  They're idiots.
[00:56:15.923 --> 00:56:18.025]  And then we need to dig it and get our comments in there.
[00:56:19.085 --> 00:56:20.286]  Let's go ahead and
[00:56:23.092 --> 00:56:24.533]  Go to your phone calls here.
[00:56:24.633 --> 00:56:25.473]  Chris in New York.
[00:56:25.513 --> 00:56:26.093]  You're on the air.
[00:56:26.133 --> 00:56:26.474]  Welcome.
[00:56:27.154 --> 00:56:27.654]  Hello, Alex.
[00:56:27.694 --> 00:56:28.074]  How are you?
[00:56:28.234 --> 00:56:28.614]  Good, sir.
[00:56:28.675 --> 00:56:29.275]  What's on your mind?
[00:56:30.175 --> 00:56:33.377]  I had the pleasure of meeting you back in September when you were up here in New York City.
[00:56:33.657 --> 00:56:34.637]  Fantastic, my friend.
[00:56:34.937 --> 00:56:36.418]  Yeah, I just wanted to pass along.
[00:56:37.778 --> 00:56:40.920]  A guy that I know is sort of a friend of the family is a New York City detective.
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:48.643]  And a couple of months ago, I got together with him to kind of see where he stood or if he knew about the whole 9-11 issue.
[00:56:49.624 --> 00:56:52.525]  And I kind of went into a slowly thing about how, you know,
[00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:57.833]  Your guys, your men, will be betrayed with the story about how, oh, the air is safe to breathe and all that.
[00:56:58.133 --> 00:56:59.374]  And I kind of got him in that way.
[00:56:59.754 --> 00:57:03.998]  I found out he was standing on the corner of Church and Vesey when the North Tower went down.
[00:57:04.478 --> 00:57:07.941]  He had no idea about any of this, you know, being an inside job or anything.
[00:57:08.542 --> 00:57:10.503]  And then I came armed with information.
[00:57:10.883 --> 00:57:13.325]  I said, have you ever heard of the Project for the New American Century?
[00:57:13.385 --> 00:57:14.026]  He said, no.
[00:57:14.126 --> 00:57:17.108]  And then I handed him the document rebuilding America's defenses.
[00:57:17.249 --> 00:57:17.529]  Wow.
[00:57:17.549 --> 00:57:18.309]  I turned to page 51.
[00:57:19.443 --> 00:57:26.237]  And I showed him, you know, the comment where, you know, they said they needed... Without a Pearl Harbor event, we can't have our New World Order, you know?
[00:57:26.417 --> 00:57:27.720]  Right, and his eyes lit up.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.447]  And he's a detective, and I said, and of course it's a year before 9-11 that that was printed.
[00:57:32.009 --> 00:57:33.530]  And his eyes lit up when I saw that.
[00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:35.271]  I said, you know, you're a detective.
[00:57:35.551 --> 00:57:36.572]  Think like a detective.
[00:57:36.832 --> 00:57:37.773]  Who had the motive?
[00:57:37.953 --> 00:57:38.493]  These guys?
[00:57:39.214 --> 00:57:45.418]  Or, uh, you know, 19 guys with box cutters who supposedly... Yeah, I mean, let's do a 2 plus 2 equals 4 equation.
[00:57:45.838 --> 00:57:46.038]  Right.
[00:57:46.079 --> 00:57:53.203]  Would the Arabs really want to attack the lone superpower to then have that military come invade them when what they want is our military out?
[00:57:53.283 --> 00:57:54.104]  No, it's the opposite.
[00:57:54.804 --> 00:57:57.866]  They're going to blow themselves up on the ground in the countries.
[00:57:57.906 --> 00:58:01.549]  They're not going to come do the thing that they know will bring the empire down on them.
[00:58:02.025 --> 00:58:15.689]  So then I showed him, you know, if you've ever seen on that document, the last name that appears on the last page is a guy named Dob Zachon, who had previously worked for System Planning Corporation and was put in charge of the money at the Pentagon.
[00:58:15.709 --> 00:58:20.730]  And then I showed him the thing with Donald Rumsfeld the day before the attack, that $2.3 trillion is missing from the Pentagon.
[00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:22.851]  And then I showed him... Associated Press!
[00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:24.440]  Stay there.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.801]  I want to hear about this when we get back.
[00:58:26.121 --> 00:58:28.023]  We'll be back in 70 seconds with the second hour.
[00:58:28.043 --> 00:58:30.684]  We're going to continue with your calls now for the next two hours.
[00:58:30.724 --> 00:58:32.425]  I've got a bunch of other news I haven't even gotten to.
[00:58:32.485 --> 00:58:39.850]  I got bushwhacked with this horrid Page Six New York Post tripe when I walked in the door.
[00:58:41.311 --> 00:58:45.893]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:58.261]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.922 --> 00:58:59.962]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.683 --> 00:59:01.824]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.444 --> 00:59:03.265]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.026 --> 00:59:05.006]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.607 --> 00:59:09.330]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:13.854]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.894 --> 00:59:21.397]  Well, the Rosie O'Donnell News finally broke into mainstream media after a week of cover-up.
[00:59:21.457 --> 00:59:22.158]  At least a week.
[00:59:22.478 --> 00:59:24.519]  Seven full days since it broke last Friday.
[00:59:24.539 --> 00:59:28.441]  It had already previously broken, but it broke big time Friday in the alternative media.
[00:59:28.921 --> 00:59:30.502]  The alternative media wouldn't touch it either.
[00:59:30.562 --> 00:59:32.843]  I mean, are you guys playing with a full deck here?
[00:59:33.383 --> 00:59:39.746]  Major controversy brings major eyeballs and ears and brains focused in on what we're doing to continue the fight.
[00:59:40.512 --> 00:59:43.194]  That's the whole reason here that we're talking about this.
[00:59:43.674 --> 00:59:45.976]  Chris in New York has family that's a detective.
[00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:48.197]  He was walking us through how he woke him up.
[00:59:48.257 --> 00:59:49.038]  Please continue.
[00:59:49.378 --> 00:59:49.919]  Yeah, okay.
[00:59:49.939 --> 01:00:06.230]  So, getting back to Zacon, when I showed him that Zacon had previously worked for a company called System Planning Corporation, and if you go to System Planning Corporation's homepage, you see that they specialize in the technology of flying aircraft by remote control.
[01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.951]  It was known as flight termination systems.
[01:00:09.091 --> 01:00:10.292]  No, I understand.
[01:00:10.332 --> 01:00:10.952]  It's incredible.
[01:00:11.212 --> 01:00:14.173]  And I showed that to the detective and he went, oh my God!
[01:00:14.574 --> 01:00:19.456]  And then we started talking about the collapse of the buildings and specifically he was there when building 7 went down.
[01:00:19.516 --> 01:00:23.378]  He said that was the thing that never made sense to him about how that building collapsed.
[01:00:23.398 --> 01:00:24.358]  But see, they're just so trusting.
[01:00:24.398 --> 01:00:25.518]  They never look.
[01:00:25.538 --> 01:00:26.339]  Yeah, they never look.
[01:00:26.379 --> 01:00:27.579]  They never look.
[01:00:27.719 --> 01:00:29.640]  It's like literally the elephant in the living room.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.181]  Right.
[01:00:30.481 --> 01:00:35.483]  And then, so we got into that whole discussion about building 7 and Larry Silverstein and all that.
[01:00:36.053 --> 01:00:43.921]  and you know the whole poet comment and he told me that he was informed that building seven was going to come down
[01:00:44.594 --> 01:00:46.975]  He was told that at about 11 o'clock in the morning.
[01:00:47.935 --> 01:00:52.677]  11 o'clock, so that means... Yeah, no, I mean, we have the firemen and police saying all day they were saying it was going to come down.
[01:00:53.057 --> 01:00:53.297]  Right.
[01:00:53.577 --> 01:00:56.098]  So the whole thing was, Silverstein's now trying to back out of things.
[01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:58.399]  Well, pull it meant to pull the firemen out.
[01:00:58.939 --> 01:01:01.380]  The firemen were out by 11, 11.30 in the morning.
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.380]  Well, here's the question.
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:06.682]  How can this family of yours know this now and not go public, see?
[01:01:07.002 --> 01:01:09.002]  Oh, well, here's the good news.
[01:01:09.323 --> 01:01:12.264]  So I left him with, I gave him a copy of the DVD, 9-11 Mysteries.
[01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:16.866]  And I said, I want you to take it, look at it, and then, you know, get back to me.
[01:01:17.387 --> 01:01:20.568]  Well, I spoke to him last week, and I said, you know, did you ever have a look at it?
[01:01:20.588 --> 01:01:21.889]  And he said several times.
[01:01:21.909 --> 01:01:23.069]  I said, oh, did you show it to your wife?
[01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:28.112]  He said, no, I brought it to the precinct where I work, and I showed it to my fellow officers.
[01:01:28.972 --> 01:01:35.015]  And he said that, you know, first one of the guys said, oh, what is it, one of those conspiracy BS things?
[01:01:35.715 --> 01:01:36.636]  Then they watched it.
[01:01:36.956 --> 01:01:43.139]  He said about a dozen guys in his precinct saw it, and now they're passing it around to their friends.
[01:01:43.755 --> 01:01:46.637]  And they're all on board because you said the evidence in that DVD is overwhelming.
[01:01:46.677 --> 01:01:47.858]  Because they were there!
[01:01:47.978 --> 01:01:49.038]  Because they were there!
[01:01:49.358 --> 01:01:53.881]  And no amount of page 6 crap, excuse my French, is going to stop us.
[01:01:54.742 --> 01:01:54.982]  Right.
[01:01:55.222 --> 01:01:57.904]  So I just think that that's one way of going about it.
[01:01:58.044 --> 01:01:58.904]  Alex, here's my opinion.
[01:01:59.024 --> 01:02:01.666]  I think we need to get law enforcement
[01:02:02.268 --> 01:02:04.249]  I agree.
[01:02:04.649 --> 01:02:05.790]  I agree.
[01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:09.993]  I primitively get mad at them and freak out on air, but it's because they're being misused.
[01:02:10.033 --> 01:02:11.153]  I don't like how they're being used.
[01:02:11.433 --> 01:02:15.496]  And I just can't believe, because I know they're not that stupid, I can't believe they won't look at the evidence.
[01:02:15.576 --> 01:02:17.657]  If they look, it's unbelievable.
[01:02:17.677 --> 01:02:18.458]  It's overwhelming.
[01:02:18.958 --> 01:02:24.061]  I mean, does he now know that they ran a CIA drill of flying hijacked jets in those very buildings at the exact same time?
[01:02:25.078 --> 01:02:26.179]  I had mentioned that to him.
[01:02:26.239 --> 01:02:32.781]  I said, yeah, how did Osama Bin Laden get NORAD, you know, and the United Air Force to stand down for an hour and 52 minutes?
[01:02:32.801 --> 01:02:35.983]  But I mean, how do you get them to run drills of the same targets being hit at the same time?
[01:02:36.043 --> 01:02:36.743]  I mean, come on!
[01:02:36.823 --> 01:02:37.844]  This is a no-brainer, folks.
[01:02:38.664 --> 01:02:39.964]  Yeah, it's a no-brainer.
[01:02:40.185 --> 01:02:41.165]  Like you said, it's perfect.
[01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:44.127]  And then they'll come back with, well, Popular Mechanics debunked it.
[01:02:44.407 --> 01:02:45.387]  They didn't debunk.
[01:02:45.407 --> 01:02:46.548]  They built straw men.
[01:02:46.928 --> 01:02:48.529]  They didn't attack what we really said.
[01:02:48.749 --> 01:02:50.770]  They made up what we said and then disproved that.
[01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:56.853]  Or they went to their own disinfo agents, we know who they are, out there putting out cockamamie stories on purpose.
[01:02:57.354 --> 01:03:02.516]  Oh, if you've ever listened to the interview I'm sure you have with Davin Coburn, who was like the researcher for that book.
[01:03:02.997 --> 01:03:04.697]  He did an interview with Charles Goyette.
[01:03:05.318 --> 01:03:06.518]  And he got slammed.
[01:03:06.558 --> 01:03:07.899]  He couldn't answer any questions.
[01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:11.449]  Yeah, I've heard the interview.
[01:03:11.469 --> 01:03:12.932]  We've interviewed Goyd, he's interviewed me.
[01:03:13.313 --> 01:03:17.362]  Oh yeah, when he said seven hijackers, you know, someone called in saying, well, seven of the hijackers are still alive.
[01:03:17.382 --> 01:03:19.447]  He goes, no they're not, we have the DNA.
[01:03:20.051 --> 01:03:30.442]  And then Goyette said to him, well, all right, if you have the DNA, how did you get the original sample of the DNA to match it up with?
[01:03:30.723 --> 01:03:33.065]  But the government doesn't even say they have the DNA!
[01:03:33.465 --> 01:03:33.686]  Right.
[01:03:33.926 --> 01:03:34.947]  It's just made up!
[01:03:35.147 --> 01:03:36.088]  They make it up, yeah.
[01:03:36.168 --> 01:03:36.969]  Just made up!
[01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:40.954]  But the average person goes, well, they said that authoritatively, Hearst Publishing.
[01:03:41.454 --> 01:03:44.521]  They're not the encyclopedia next to the word yellow journalism.
[01:03:45.323 --> 01:03:46.265]  Yes they are, folks.
[01:03:46.285 --> 01:03:49.091]  They wrote the book on government propaganda.
[01:03:49.512 --> 01:03:49.852]  Okay?
[01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:50.815]  They're Hitler.
[01:03:53.506 --> 01:03:57.067]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:03:57.107 --> 01:03:57.627]  are located?
[01:03:57.827 --> 01:04:01.208]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:04:01.428 --> 01:04:06.149]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[01:04:53.022 --> 01:05:01.388]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:01.768 --> 01:05:09.374]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.091 --> 01:05:17.154]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.534 --> 01:05:28.959]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.279 --> 01:05:32.801]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.241 --> 01:05:35.182]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.502 --> 01:05:39.344]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.177 --> 01:05:55.538]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:55.778 --> 01:05:57.799]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:05:57.959 --> 01:06:05.123]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents or other dangerous toxins.
[01:06:05.263 --> 01:06:13.887]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company for the past 57 years has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:06:14.187 --> 01:06:18.729]  Now for the first time Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family
[01:06:19.009 --> 01:06:25.657]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients, is earth-friendly, and completely environmentally safe.
[01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:30.202]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[01:06:33.746 --> 01:06:34.686]  Well, I'm very honored that 9-11 Philly
[01:07:04.295 --> 01:07:05.276]  We're good to go.
[01:07:28.542 --> 01:07:30.944]  Truth Guys from Philly on as soon as possible.
[01:07:31.264 --> 01:07:34.587]  Had I finished up with Chris, or is he gone now?
[01:07:36.068 --> 01:07:39.391]  Chris just finished up, so I'm going to go to Michael Rivero to get his take on all this real fast.
[01:07:39.811 --> 01:07:40.972]  It's Mike Rivero, not Matt.
[01:07:41.852 --> 01:07:42.073]  Yes.
[01:07:43.294 --> 01:07:44.695]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[01:07:44.735 --> 01:07:46.656]  But listen, where is it now?
[01:07:46.676 --> 01:07:48.337]  I mean, are these cops going to go public?
[01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:55.063]  Remember this, when I was at Ground Zero in 2004, about half the cops hated us, the other half liked us.
[01:07:56.361 --> 01:08:00.523]  This time I said about 70% were fans going, yeah, we know it's an inside job.
[01:08:00.563 --> 01:08:01.124]  Keep it up, Alex.
[01:08:01.144 --> 01:08:02.424]  We've seen Terror Storm.
[01:08:02.964 --> 01:08:04.585]  Hey, we've seen Martial Law.
[01:08:04.605 --> 01:08:05.706]  Hey, we've seen Loose Change.
[01:08:07.367 --> 01:08:09.868]  Almost all, I mean, 90 plus percent of the firefighters.
[01:08:10.308 --> 01:08:11.189]  I couldn't get work done.
[01:08:11.229 --> 01:08:11.889]  I couldn't do interviews.
[01:08:11.929 --> 01:08:13.049]  The firefighters were all over us.
[01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:15.591]  I mean, they really know because they know fire.
[01:08:16.511 --> 01:08:17.432]  Now the facts have come out.
[01:08:18.592 --> 01:08:23.935]  I mean, what's going to happen to the government as this chain reaction continues and you say he went and woke up everybody at his office?
[01:08:24.755 --> 01:08:25.315]  Absolutely.
[01:08:25.376 --> 01:08:26.536]  I appreciate you joining us.
[01:08:26.556 --> 01:08:26.737]  Coming up,
[01:08:50.117 --> 01:08:51.558]  Keep me abreast of that as it develops.
[01:08:51.578 --> 01:09:06.671]  9-11 truthers confront Alan Mingala Dershowitz, brainwashed rapture stone fake Christians and Israeli furshers scream and boo, throw their toys out of the pram.
[01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:08.352]  Hey, watch and change that!
[01:09:08.472 --> 01:09:10.194]  Out of the child's pen.
[01:09:10.234 --> 01:09:13.176]  I know you call it pram in England, but no one understands that over here.
[01:09:13.557 --> 01:09:14.537]  We have limited vocabulary.
[01:09:17.052 --> 01:09:20.114]  So, out of the playpen, can we change that to playpen?
[01:09:20.354 --> 01:09:22.596]  I don't do my editing here on air, but good job, Watson.
[01:09:22.976 --> 01:09:24.717]  Playpen, not pram.
[01:09:25.457 --> 01:09:26.558]  No one will understand that.
[01:09:27.739 --> 01:09:29.560]  Or at least 90% of people.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.362]  Going now to Matt Rivero.
[01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:35.038]  It's good to have Matt Rivero.
[01:09:35.158 --> 01:09:46.328]  Oh, I'm sorry, the New York Post couldn't even get that right when they attacked Michael Rivero, myself, Martin Sheen, Charlie Sheen, Rosie O'Donnell, and the Easter Bunny in a page six, biggest gossip column story in the country.
[01:09:46.629 --> 01:09:53.455]  It finally broke, and I guess through silver linings because somebody leaked this, and I think I know who that somebody is they shouldn't have.
[01:09:53.815 --> 01:09:55.277]  Hope this doesn't damage its prospects.
[01:09:55.317 --> 01:09:56.158]  Mike, what do you think of all this?
[01:09:57.170 --> 01:10:01.054]  Well, I just became aware of it myself and I can't stop laughing.
[01:10:01.134 --> 01:10:11.804]  I brought this article up on my web browser and my entire computer turned yellow from the yellow journalism and it starts off with the hooker-loving Hollywood hunk.
[01:10:11.884 --> 01:10:16.068]  I mean, I think there's a little bit of a bias going into this article right from the start.
[01:10:16.668 --> 01:10:21.249]  But, of course, what everybody seems to be picking up on is that they couldn't even get my name correct.
[01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:32.673]  They call me Matt Rivero, which says they did not even bother going to the website WhatReallyHappened.com because it says right at the very top, Michael Rivero's WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:10:33.513 --> 01:10:38.955]  And it's just amazing when they start out where they don't even have the name correct.
[01:10:38.995 --> 01:10:42.716]  It pretty much, I think, pulls the rug out from under everything else that they're saying here.
[01:10:42.856 --> 01:10:45.337]  Are you going to call for a retraction, Page Six?
[01:10:46.736 --> 01:10:48.577]  Yeah, I think we ought to at this point.
[01:10:48.617 --> 01:10:50.638]  Correction, correction, correction.
[01:10:51.559 --> 01:10:52.899]  Yeah, correction.
[01:10:53.139 --> 01:11:01.084]  The other one, of course, is they're saying here that, you know, widely debunked claims about the collapse of the solar system.
[01:11:01.104 --> 01:11:02.284]  I say that several times.
[01:11:02.304 --> 01:11:05.766]  It's just like everyone knows the moon is made of cheese.
[01:11:07.167 --> 01:11:09.188]  That's exactly the kind of tactic they're using.
[01:11:09.208 --> 01:11:11.749]  They're taking the position that nobody believes this.
[01:11:11.929 --> 01:11:12.830]  It's way out there.
[01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:13.990]  Nobody's paying attention.
[01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:14.931]  These are all idiots.
[01:11:15.561 --> 01:11:19.502]  And it's just a blatant smear job, and I gotta tell you, I can't stop laughing.
[01:11:19.542 --> 01:11:21.142]  I'm gonna frame this and hang it on the wall.
[01:11:21.482 --> 01:11:24.763]  This is just hilarious to see this in print.
[01:11:25.443 --> 01:11:37.385]  But getting into what your site actually covers on 7, for those that just joined us, and most of you aren't sick of hearing about it, you know it's really the number one smoking gun, the key, and there are several others, but we've got them dead to rights here.
[01:11:38.506 --> 01:11:40.106]  What do you think was really planned with 7?
[01:11:40.306 --> 01:11:42.066]  Crystallize it if you can in like two minutes.
[01:11:42.286 --> 01:11:43.147]  What happened with 7?
[01:11:43.647 --> 01:11:44.527]  Why is it so important?
[01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:54.294]  Building number 7, the Solomon Brothers building, where all the government offices were located, and it was a bomb-resistant, fire-resistant building, more so than normal.
[01:11:54.514 --> 01:11:56.995]  It was the State County Federal Emergency Command Center.
[01:11:57.875 --> 01:12:02.257]  Yeah, the theory is that Flight 93 was going to crash into that building.
[01:12:02.297 --> 01:12:09.240]  If you watch the No Dead Brothers documentary, 9-11, the firefighters are saying a third plane is reported inbound to New York.
[01:12:09.887 --> 01:12:13.730]  And the theory is that Flight 93 was planned to crash into Building No.
[01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:13.730]  7.
[01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:22.215]  Well, as everybody knows, Flight 93 either crashed or was shot down in Pennsylvania, but they had to bring down World Trade Center 7 anyway.
[01:12:22.235 --> 01:12:24.517]  So that was going to be the trifecta bonus.
[01:12:25.938 --> 01:12:26.458]  Exactly.
[01:12:26.498 --> 01:12:37.926]  That was really going to hammer home the destruction and the terror, but they had to take down World Trade Center 7 anyway, because had they gone back in and found the demolition charges, the story would have been over.
[01:12:38.464 --> 01:12:45.569]  So they had to come up with this silly story that the building collapsed from fire, and there was really very little fire visible in it.
[01:12:45.589 --> 01:12:53.194]  And then after the third plane didn't come, there's no fires, Giuliani and everybody pull out, fires start, and then a perfect demolition.
[01:12:53.214 --> 01:12:54.335]  I mean, this is ridiculous!
[01:12:55.135 --> 01:12:55.675]  It really is.
[01:12:55.695 --> 01:12:56.356]  It's ridiculous!
[01:12:56.396 --> 01:12:57.777]  How dumb do you think we are?
[01:12:59.767 --> 01:13:09.718]  Well, I gotta tell you, I know that the whole thing about World Trade Center 7, especially after we caught the BBC and CNN reporting the building had collapsed before it actually happened.
[01:13:09.858 --> 01:13:11.160]  Tell people how that's important.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.081]  Some people don't get it.
[01:13:13.817 --> 01:13:18.920]  Well, we have a video from the British Broadcasting Corporation reporting that Building No.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:22.142]  7 had collapsed while it's still standing behind the reporter.
[01:13:22.182 --> 01:13:28.105]  And the reason it's important is because before 9-11, no steel frame building had ever collapsed from fire.
[01:13:28.366 --> 01:13:31.748]  So there was no reason for anybody to be going around saying, Building No.
[01:13:31.768 --> 01:13:32.568]  7 is going to collapse.
[01:13:32.628 --> 01:13:34.089]  It shows total scripting!
[01:13:35.017 --> 01:13:54.891]  There was no historical precedent for it whatsoever, so it just made it really obvious that a script was being followed, that somebody was issuing these statements, that the media was simply echoing, and the timing got messed up, and Building 7 was reported as down before the demolition was carried out, and we have the proof of that on the BBC videos.
[01:13:56.852 --> 01:13:57.492]  Absolutely.
[01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:11.779]  It seems like, I mean, we were on the offensive six months ago, a year ago, and I do give Charlie Sheen credit, not just because he did it here on this show, or I'm friends with him, but because I've plotted it.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:16.824]  I mean, I've plotted it out, after it happened, I've done a retrospective, I've looked at it.
[01:14:17.244 --> 01:14:24.310]  He goes public, they take the bait, because he's got a few skeletons, like anybody does, in his past.
[01:14:25.245 --> 01:14:26.185]  They demonize.
[01:14:26.285 --> 01:14:27.126]  It doesn't work.
[01:14:27.446 --> 01:14:33.748]  The polls show 84% on the CNN show, 83% supporting.
[01:14:34.209 --> 01:14:35.649]  Then I talked to CNN execs.
[01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:36.730]  They're told, kill the story.
[01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:38.690]  The story nationally is shut down.
[01:14:39.051 --> 01:14:41.151]  But it energized 9-11 Truth.
[01:14:41.271 --> 01:14:45.893]  All the sites I talked to said they had double, triple, quadruple, in some cases, visitors for a few months.
[01:14:46.253 --> 01:14:48.514]  Charlie had the idea for the 9-11 symposium.
[01:14:48.915 --> 01:14:50.215]  That caused a chain reaction.
[01:14:50.255 --> 01:14:51.696]  It aired four times on C-SPAN.
[01:14:51.956 --> 01:14:54.717]  Then all these other people, other stars start going public.
[01:14:55.478 --> 01:14:56.759]  More and more evidence comes out.
[01:14:56.799 --> 01:14:58.241]  This BBC thing comes out.
[01:14:58.481 --> 01:14:59.182]  BBC thing.
[01:14:59.462 --> 01:15:00.643]  I mean, it's just so much.
[01:15:00.723 --> 01:15:02.385]  This is just crescendo.
[01:15:03.206 --> 01:15:05.909]  Mike, I mean, I see them just in deep trouble.
[01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:08.391]  Their debunkers are being debunked.
[01:15:08.451 --> 01:15:11.435]  They are in just headlong retreat right now.
[01:15:12.412 --> 01:15:15.095]  Well, this article clearly has panic all over it.
[01:15:15.195 --> 01:15:17.016]  There's very little factual information.
[01:15:17.056 --> 01:15:18.137]  They got my name wrong.
[01:15:18.478 --> 01:15:22.301]  They're using all these very obvious smears and character assassinations.
[01:15:22.582 --> 01:15:23.903]  This is a panic reaction.
[01:15:24.423 --> 01:15:29.268]  And I think they have really started to understand that they have not fooled the American people with this.
[01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:32.396]  And again, folks, we're not putting this good face on it.
[01:15:32.456 --> 01:15:33.897]  They've got control of the military.
[01:15:33.917 --> 01:15:35.057]  They've got control of the culture.
[01:15:35.317 --> 01:15:36.557]  They've got control of the finances.
[01:15:36.597 --> 01:15:37.437]  We're winning battles.
[01:15:37.737 --> 01:15:38.738]  We have not won the war.
[01:15:38.798 --> 01:15:45.499]  We're in deep, mortal combat with very sinister oligarchy, the Anglo-American-slash-APAC crime syndicate.
[01:15:46.159 --> 01:15:48.199]  And this is very, very serious.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:54.841]  But we are having an effect on them, and they are really scared right now.
[01:15:56.684 --> 01:16:03.147]  I mean, you could see them, up until just a few months ago, they were still invoking 9-11 every 10 seconds, and Cheney still tries it every once in a while.
[01:16:03.187 --> 01:16:07.870]  Bush said, if you don't keep doing the Iraq War, Al-Qaeda will hit again.
[01:16:08.210 --> 01:16:09.311]  But it just, it doesn't work.
[01:16:09.351 --> 01:16:13.693]  Everybody I talk to, every cop I talk to, just says it's pure bull now, Mike.
[01:16:14.508 --> 01:16:15.309]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:15.349 --> 01:16:16.650]  I'm getting the same reaction.
[01:16:17.631 --> 01:16:20.874]  I can't even find anybody anymore who trusts the official story.
[01:16:21.574 --> 01:16:27.059]  And I think on this one, we can say, I think we've definitely brought the truth to the American people.
[01:16:27.359 --> 01:16:31.163]  Now, anybody who's still waiting for the government to admit that they're wrong, they're going to wait forever.
[01:16:31.203 --> 01:16:33.264]  The government will never admit that they're wrong.
[01:16:33.545 --> 01:16:34.546]  But who cares?
[01:16:34.706 --> 01:16:39.410]  At this point, the majority of the American people know what happened, and that is what counts.
[01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:49.675]  Well, everybody in the Truth Movement and the Patriot Movement has got to pull together now more than ever, because times are so dark, things are so serious.
[01:16:50.075 --> 01:16:57.539]  This cornered behemoth, this cornered leviathan, this cornered juggernaut has not been vanquished.
[01:16:57.559 --> 01:17:04.382]  It may be on fire and smoking out of different orifices, but it is not down.
[01:17:05.419 --> 01:17:11.761]  No, it is cornered, and a cornered animal is the most dangerous, but I think we're going to be seeing some very interesting changes in the next few months.
[01:17:13.121 --> 01:17:25.985]  It seems they're kind of slowing down, the world's going to end because of terror and trying to go to plan B of the earth is dying, it's got a fever, pay a global tax, send people to jail for dripping motor oil, or your children will die.
[01:17:27.325 --> 01:17:29.626]  I think basically they're in thrash mode.
[01:17:29.666 --> 01:17:33.427]  They're flinging around trying to find anything that they can get traction with
[01:17:33.789 --> 01:17:36.832]  To get the people to go back to being obedient little serfs.
[01:17:37.312 --> 01:17:41.556]  But it's not working because government functions very often like a religion.
[01:17:41.896 --> 01:17:45.820]  And once the people lose faith, you just don't get it back overnight.
[01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:51.025]  And the United States government definitely is facing a crisis of credibility of their own making.
[01:17:51.645 --> 01:17:55.208]  It took, you know, centuries to build up trust in the American government.
[01:17:55.309 --> 01:17:58.111]  And we've seen that trust squandered over the last 10-15 years.
[01:17:59.831 --> 01:18:04.553]  It's not going to come back overnight, no matter how many scarecrows and false flags and booga boogas they put up.
[01:18:06.034 --> 01:18:11.296]  That is a crisis in and of itself, and we want to bring this down, but we don't want its falling to crush us, Mike.
[01:18:11.356 --> 01:18:12.736]  How do you see this fleshing out?
[01:18:14.237 --> 01:18:21.220]  Well, I have been of the opinion all along that ultimately we're going to see the government of the United States go the way of the USSR.
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:26.902]  It's simply going to collapse from its own corruption, its own lies, its own excesses.
[01:18:27.498 --> 01:18:36.224]  And there will be a period of confusion out of which we will see a new country emerge, much as we've seen the new Russian republics emerge from the old USSR.
[01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:39.727]  I think overall for the common people it's going to be a very good thing.
[01:18:39.847 --> 01:18:43.730]  A lot of privileged, entrenched power, of course, will fall away.
[01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:45.291]  That's going to be rough in the process.
[01:18:45.751 --> 01:18:48.053]  Matt Rivero, thanks for joining us.
[01:18:48.073 --> 01:18:48.553]  You're welcome.
[01:18:48.573 --> 01:18:50.014]  Do you want to add something after the break?
[01:18:50.895 --> 01:18:51.475]  No, that's fine.
[01:18:51.555 --> 01:18:52.256]  Okay, take care.
[01:18:52.276 --> 01:18:52.456]  Thanks.
[01:18:54.941 --> 01:18:55.983]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:18:56.303 --> 01:18:59.087]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:18:59.368 --> 01:19:03.514]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:19:03.954 --> 01:19:04.776]  So what do you do?
[01:19:05.096 --> 01:19:09.663]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:19:10.143 --> 01:19:12.264]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[01:19:53.724 --> 01:19:55.685]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:19:55.745 --> 01:19:56.125]  It's March 22, 2007.
[01:19:56.185 --> 01:19:59.066]  Gold is at $6.63, and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $6.86.
[01:19:59.106 --> 01:19:59.066]  $6.66, $3.45.
[01:19:59.226 --> 01:19:59.566]  $8.88 for half, and $1.72.
[01:19:59.606 --> 01:20:00.646]  $0.94 for quarter ounce coins at $6.86. $6.66.
[01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:10.470]  345.88 and 172.94.
[01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:15.412]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[01:20:15.472 --> 01:20:18.473]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[01:20:18.553 --> 01:20:24.235]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long Term Fiscal Outlook document.
[01:20:24.595 --> 01:20:27.637]  Clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[01:20:27.957 --> 01:20:33.259]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[01:20:33.699 --> 01:20:36.001]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:38.523]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[01:20:38.883 --> 01:20:40.665]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:20:42.226 --> 01:20:45.889]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[01:20:45.949 --> 01:20:46.229]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:46.249 --> 01:20:46.429]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.385 --> 01:20:55.126]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:20:55.266 --> 01:20:56.547]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:20:56.747 --> 01:20:59.588]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:20:59.948 --> 01:21:02.709]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:09.953]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:21:53.061 --> 01:21:59.545]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:21:59.785 --> 01:22:03.807]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:22:04.047 --> 01:22:06.208]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[01:22:06.568 --> 01:22:13.532]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[01:22:13.892 --> 01:22:16.494]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[01:22:16.775 --> 01:22:20.297]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[01:22:20.558 --> 01:22:23.480]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:28.424]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:22:28.825 --> 01:22:30.326]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:22:30.606 --> 01:22:34.029]  You'll find Non-X Gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X.
[01:22:34.409 --> 01:22:42.533]  In the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, Duane Reade and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[01:22:42.993 --> 01:22:45.294]  Or online at drugstore.com.
[01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:51.097]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:22:53.958 --> 01:22:56.699]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:56.719 --> 01:23:00.561]  It's Alex Jones only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:06.879 --> 01:23:15.164]  Well, I tell ya, I just learn more and more here by the minute.
[01:23:15.504 --> 01:23:25.630]  I guess I've been so busy this morning I didn't learn that we got a call concerning this, uh, page six thing yesterday and this morning and I wasn't told about it.
[01:23:27.471 --> 01:23:29.553]  Oh my gosh, I know we've got phone calls here.
[01:23:29.613 --> 01:23:31.774]  Did they just give you his number to call him, John?
[01:23:34.727 --> 01:23:36.348]  Okay, because this is a total war room.
[01:23:36.368 --> 01:23:37.969]  I just got a call from William Rodriguez.
[01:23:38.729 --> 01:23:40.470]  Willie, I want to get him on right now.
[01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:42.971]  He's either calling in, or you're supposed to be giving his number.
[01:23:42.991 --> 01:23:45.693]  I mean, you ought to see it, folks.
[01:23:45.733 --> 01:23:50.856]  I'm just running around, foaming at the mouth in between breaks, doing five different things, calling people, working on different stories.
[01:23:51.976 --> 01:23:54.718]  We are clear to fire on the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:54.758 --> 01:23:56.819]  We have orbited the planet at maximum velocity.
[01:23:57.609 --> 01:23:59.711]  And we are clear to fire on the enemy.
[01:23:59.811 --> 01:24:06.416]  I'm telling you, right now, we need to just, all of us, intensify our firepower on the New World Order.
[01:24:08.038 --> 01:24:09.859]  Concentrate our fire on these people.
[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:15.364]  And, you know, I probably could have handled it better back in the first hour, getting mad about this movie thing coming out.
[01:24:15.504 --> 01:24:18.967]  I had just been told it was so important to keep it secret for the project.
[01:24:20.781 --> 01:24:23.722]  But like I said earlier, maybe it's for the best.
[01:24:23.762 --> 01:24:28.404]  Maybe it's a good thing in the final equation that this indeed came out.
[01:24:29.784 --> 01:24:31.945]  Have they instant messaged you yet the phone number to call?
[01:24:33.886 --> 01:24:34.406]  Okay, great.
[01:24:35.386 --> 01:24:36.487]  Okay, we'll go to him right now.
[01:24:36.547 --> 01:24:37.187]  Fantastic.
[01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:41.588]  Just absolutely incredible.
[01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:48.771]  Okay, William Rodriguez, the hero of 9-11 who saved all those people and barely made it out of the building.
[01:24:49.514 --> 01:24:51.375]  My good friend joins us.
[01:24:51.915 --> 01:24:52.695]  Willie, how you doing?
[01:24:53.276 --> 01:24:54.016]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:24:54.116 --> 01:24:54.416]  Here.
[01:24:55.056 --> 01:24:57.797]  Pissed off with the... Look, I'm sorry of earlier.
[01:24:57.858 --> 01:24:58.978]  I didn't know who'd leaked it.
[01:24:58.998 --> 01:25:00.619]  I thought it was you or somebody else.
[01:25:00.919 --> 01:25:04.040]  My hunch was right that it had been leaked, but now you have the full story.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.381]  I'm not saying anything bad.
[01:25:05.861 --> 01:25:08.622]  I had just been sworn to secrecy, and now I learned that you weren't.
[01:25:09.062 --> 01:25:11.483]  So I'm not mad at you, and I apologize if it came off wrong.
[01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:12.724]  I just called you a big mouth.
[01:25:13.084 --> 01:25:13.944]  I got a big mouth, too.
[01:25:13.964 --> 01:25:15.305]  In fact, mine's bigger than yours.
[01:25:16.385 --> 01:25:17.646]  And I'm not as handsome as you.
[01:25:17.986 --> 01:25:24.248]  I did call earlier, before even the article came out, because I got an email with the article before it even came out.
[01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:25.989]  Okay, I'm sorry I wasn't told.
[01:25:26.129 --> 01:25:29.370]  I'm sorry you told my audience I'm out wearing last night and this morning.
[01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:32.231]  I don't know why in Hades I wasn't told, but fine.
[01:25:32.831 --> 01:25:36.234]  I did speak to them yesterday.
[01:25:36.254 --> 01:25:41.197]  I was talking about the Rosie O'Donnell situation and I was showing support like I always did.
[01:25:41.217 --> 01:25:41.818]  I know.
[01:25:42.178 --> 01:25:43.339]  Willie, I mean you're a sweetheart.
[01:25:43.359 --> 01:25:44.500]  You're a hero of 9-11.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.500]  You're the key master.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:46.121]  We know that.
[01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:50.144]  I just was told if this came out it could be damaging to the film.
[01:25:51.039 --> 01:25:53.920]  Oh, she's doing better after the miscarriage.
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:55.661]  Yeah, she's doing much better.
[01:25:55.681 --> 01:25:55.901]  Oh my God.
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:17.542]  Well, yesterday was a very turning point for the movement.
[01:26:19.083 --> 01:26:29.490]  I did hear what was going on over there through your radio show with Luke, who he did actually the best thing that we could have done, protesting in front over there.
[01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:34.352]  I got big news coming out afterwards with Rosie.
[01:26:34.793 --> 01:26:35.873]  It's not going to be public yet.
[01:26:36.354 --> 01:26:39.416]  I did speak to the New York Post yesterday about the Rosie situation.
[01:26:39.436 --> 01:26:41.637]  They did ask me whatever happened with the
[01:26:42.416 --> 01:26:43.057]  I don't know.
[01:27:05.729 --> 01:27:07.170]  Oh, well, I appreciate that.
[01:27:08.051 --> 01:27:08.971]  You know why I got mad?
[01:27:09.031 --> 01:27:16.696]  I was told to be all secretive about this, and later I found out that you really weren't told not to talk about it, and I don't know exactly what happened with that, so I apologize.
[01:27:16.816 --> 01:27:17.316]  No, no, no.
[01:27:17.356 --> 01:27:19.878]  Here, you can call me Big Mouth back.
[01:27:20.558 --> 01:27:21.199]  No, no, no.
[01:27:21.359 --> 01:27:21.999]  Call me Big Mouth.
[01:27:22.479 --> 01:27:27.443]  No, no, no, no, no, but I was, you know, concerned that the information was going out there wrong.
[01:27:27.623 --> 01:27:29.324]  But my hunch was correct, though.
[01:27:29.344 --> 01:27:31.685]  I mean, did you tell him about the movie?
[01:27:32.666 --> 01:27:32.766]  No!
[01:27:34.761 --> 01:27:35.363]  No, we're talking about...
[01:27:39.389 --> 01:27:43.290]  The first movie, remember when Charlie said that he would like to do a movie about my life?
[01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:44.970]  Yeah, but I'm talking about the second.
[01:27:45.610 --> 01:27:46.630]  I mean, where did they get this from?
[01:27:46.650 --> 01:27:47.010]  No, no, no.
[01:27:47.050 --> 01:27:48.331]  They already had that information.
[01:27:48.391 --> 01:27:55.432]  They said, this is what they said, are you involved with Charlie Chin's new production?
[01:27:55.832 --> 01:28:00.433]  Because we already have information that he's going out to do something new.
[01:28:00.453 --> 01:28:01.733]  And I said, no.
[01:28:01.753 --> 01:28:04.034]  And he said, well, we're checking out something.
[01:28:04.054 --> 01:28:04.974]  We'll get back to you.
[01:28:05.194 --> 01:28:05.974]  And they were very nice.
[01:28:07.095 --> 01:28:18.769]  Well, apparently when they called that guy Cuban, he already said something that he was narrating or something like that.
[01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:20.211]  Well, he's on the article.
[01:28:24.804 --> 01:28:26.345]  No, I mean, I know they contacted him.
[01:28:26.766 --> 01:28:28.747]  It says after they learned of it, they did contact him.
[01:28:29.047 --> 01:28:29.708]  Well, fantastic.
[01:28:29.728 --> 01:28:39.175]  Well, let's talk about what you're doing in your life and where all this is going, and maybe we can twist your arm into telling us what the big breaking news is with William Rodriguez, hero of 9-11.
[01:28:43.718 --> 01:28:44.659]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.099 --> 01:28:46.760]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:50.303]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.923 --> 01:28:54.343]  Attention!
[01:28:54.444 --> 01:28:57.266]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[01:28:57.566 --> 01:29:01.870]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:02.871]  Listen closely.
[01:29:03.511 --> 01:29:10.977]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[01:29:11.278 --> 01:29:20.045]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[01:29:20.345 --> 01:29:25.868]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[01:29:26.148 --> 01:29:35.613]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[01:29:35.813 --> 01:29:41.376]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[01:29:41.616 --> 01:29:45.198]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[01:29:45.418 --> 01:29:49.221]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:49.441 --> 01:29:57.186]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:29:57.426 --> 01:29:58.286]  Look no further!
[01:29:58.587 --> 01:30:01.168]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:30:01.588 --> 01:30:09.053]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about
[01:30:09.053 --> 01:30:09.553]  I think so.
[01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:28.551]  We're good to go.
[01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:59.432]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:30:59.653 --> 01:31:01.414]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:31:01.694 --> 01:31:07.977]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:31:08.278 --> 01:31:14.381]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:31:14.641 --> 01:31:20.665]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:31:20.945 --> 01:31:22.566]  With no side effects.
[01:31:22.606 --> 01:31:27.349]  The 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:31:27.509 --> 01:31:31.031]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:31:31.351 --> 01:31:35.054]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:31:35.234 --> 01:31:37.775]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:31:37.915 --> 01:31:38.956]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:40.416 --> 01:31:42.797]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[01:31:42.817 --> 01:31:43.317]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:31:43.337 --> 01:31:43.397]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:32:11.838 --> 01:32:22.187]  There must be some kind of way out of here Said that joker to the thief There's too much confusion
[01:32:27.685 --> 01:32:29.405]  Well, I feel bad.
[01:32:29.465 --> 01:32:30.906]  I have an egg on my face.
[01:32:30.926 --> 01:32:32.066]  You know, I like Willie.
[01:32:32.086 --> 01:32:32.906]  He's a really great guy.
[01:32:32.926 --> 01:32:34.507]  I've met him at several big events.
[01:32:34.527 --> 01:32:35.807]  I've interviewed him many times.
[01:32:35.867 --> 01:32:39.248]  He did one of his rare sit-down video interviews with me, which is really hard to get.
[01:32:39.268 --> 01:32:41.608]  The Blues Change guys took months to get it.
[01:32:42.049 --> 01:32:43.109]  They were just telling me the other day.
[01:32:44.129 --> 01:32:47.430]  I just knew that Willie had talked to Page Six before about movie ideas.
[01:32:48.251 --> 01:32:48.672]  I don't think so.
[01:32:55.868 --> 01:32:56.588]  No, I don't think so.
[01:33:20.591 --> 01:33:30.547]  Because by about 30 minutes into the show I was mad when I first got on air because I started thinking well at least Rosie O'Donnell stuff's public now and who knows this will get attention on it now and
[01:33:31.932 --> 01:33:39.796]  May actually make it be even better, or if Mark Cuban ends up not doing it at 2929, then it's going to get made somewhere.
[01:33:40.177 --> 01:33:42.198]  And I talked to the Loose Change guys, they totally agree.
[01:33:42.718 --> 01:33:46.100]  So, you know, I started thinking too, there's so many other people that could have leaked it.
[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:53.224]  I was just trying to think, because, you know, Willie's such a nice guy, that he just might have been, oh yeah, you know, not knowing, or somebody didn't tell him it was a secret.
[01:33:53.904 --> 01:33:56.705]  And so, again, Willie, I apologize.
[01:33:56.725 --> 01:33:59.886]  I mean, only you would be out there listening and know who I might have been talking about.
[01:34:00.166 --> 01:34:02.207]  So I apologize if I was wrong in the last hour.
[01:34:02.427 --> 01:34:07.708]  But at least we can now, in the next hour, fix all that, my friend.
[01:34:10.891 --> 01:34:17.475]  People trying to attack us that I will be with my antennas up very easily.
[01:34:17.915 --> 01:34:28.501]  On another point, I just wanted to tell you Kevin Barrett was attacked by a survivor that was brought by the youth Republican group in UW University.
[01:34:29.082 --> 01:34:39.908]  And I sent an email directly to Kevin to set up another presentation with UW and I will go there to support him because I support the research that he's doing.
[01:34:40.868 --> 01:34:43.169]  Oh my God, somebody attacked Kevin Barrett?
[01:34:43.709 --> 01:35:00.973]  Oh yes, while he was out of the campus doing presentations somewhere in another state, they brought a survivor from 9-11 from the 50-something floor to speak to a survivor that I never heard of, as a matter of fact, to speak to the Republican Union or something like that.
[01:35:01.893 --> 01:35:04.754]  And the guy decided to attack Kevin Barrett.
[01:35:05.732 --> 01:35:09.336]  And number one, you know, I said, never heard of the guy.
[01:35:09.356 --> 01:35:11.899]  And, you know, I'm not doubting his story.
[01:35:11.919 --> 01:35:14.903]  And it may be a powerful story.
[01:35:15.143 --> 01:35:22.632]  But, you know, to attack somebody that is doing an honest and positive research to get answers of what happened on that day is a no-no for us.
[01:35:23.192 --> 01:35:35.697]  So I will basically volunteer my time and my presentation to go to UW, but I believe that UW will now say, well, they will not have me over there because you already have one.
[01:35:35.757 --> 01:35:37.758]  So there's not going to be equal opportunities.
[01:35:37.778 --> 01:35:40.179]  So I spoke to Kevin Barrett this morning.
[01:35:40.479 --> 01:35:43.420]  He was very ecstatic that I came out to his defense.
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:44.601]  I think you're right.
[01:36:03.587 --> 01:36:18.535]  And people can actually help us to continue this search and this quest for the truth, donating through the website or buying the DVD that I have there, which is basically the DVD re-edited from your event in California.
[01:36:19.221 --> 01:36:22.422]  Which it came out to be one of the most powerful presentations that we ever did.
[01:36:22.482 --> 01:36:23.582]  Oh, it was fantastic.
[01:36:23.642 --> 01:36:26.383]  To a crowd of 1,200 people.
[01:36:26.423 --> 01:36:28.063]  I didn't even know there was a DVD of that.
[01:36:28.103 --> 01:36:32.104]  I mean, I know we shot it and put some stuff out, and I know you guys shot it.
[01:36:32.685 --> 01:36:33.785]  Maybe I want to carry that up.
[01:36:34.005 --> 01:36:35.225]  How do folks get a copy of that?
[01:36:35.265 --> 01:36:36.085]  How long is it?
[01:36:36.306 --> 01:36:37.066]  Where do they write to?
[01:36:37.086 --> 01:36:37.886]  Do they go to the website?
[01:36:38.346 --> 01:36:41.652]  They go to the website 911keymaster.com.
[01:36:41.892 --> 01:36:45.458]  We're actually working on something bigger right now and you're going to love this Alex.
[01:36:45.779 --> 01:36:49.485]  I just came back from my very successful tour in the UK.
[01:36:50.482 --> 01:36:55.643]  Which was basically the biggest thing that we ever did over there.
[01:36:55.723 --> 01:36:59.904]  We were able to organize most of the groups and create new, new attention.
[01:37:00.364 --> 01:37:11.065]  The media over there, I'm talking about every BBC, local radio in every city, from London all the way to Scotland, was positive of our quest.
[01:37:11.506 --> 01:37:16.686]  But the funny thing is that I was there when they did their hit piece against you and the Loose Change people.
[01:37:17.267 --> 01:37:20.147]  Well, that was an incredible hit piece, wasn't it?
[01:37:20.774 --> 01:37:38.401]  Yeah, as a matter of fact, I called Kevin, your producer, from London to tell him that I was actually doing some of the radio interviews, countering the events of... I remember the... Oh, his phone just went dead.
[01:37:38.421 --> 01:37:40.102]  Do you have his number, John?
[01:37:41.542 --> 01:37:43.003]  Call him back, that happens sometimes.
[01:37:44.286 --> 01:37:45.747]  Well, anyways, interesting.
[01:37:45.787 --> 01:37:49.809]  William did talk to the New York Post, but they'd already contacted him.
[01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:51.330]  I knew he had a connection there.
[01:37:52.491 --> 01:37:56.913]  So I was partially right, but not entirely right, according to William.
[01:37:56.953 --> 01:37:57.594]  And I believe him.
[01:37:57.774 --> 01:37:58.434]  He's a great guy.
[01:37:58.834 --> 01:38:01.296]  I'm sure something this big, you can't keep contained forever.
[01:38:03.317 --> 01:38:07.479]  But generally, as a rule, it's not good that it got out.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:12.903]  Generally, as a rule, it is not positive that it got out.
[01:38:12.923 --> 01:38:13.463]  But you never know.
[01:38:14.782 --> 01:38:18.983]  It is positive that the Rosie O'Donnell thing got out, and that's now broken.
[01:38:20.004 --> 01:38:22.044]  And the neocons won't be able to help by taking the bait.
[01:38:23.425 --> 01:38:27.726]  And so that is positive that this broke in the page six.
[01:38:28.466 --> 01:38:35.388]  I mean, the more I think about it, and hell, even if it's a bad thing, you know, you've got lemons make lemonade.
[01:38:38.829 --> 01:38:40.630]  Well, they're at the CFR, they said.
[01:38:40.650 --> 01:38:43.651]  We need to use this disaster to create a new world order.
[01:38:44.446 --> 01:38:50.508]  Make lemonade with lemons, but William, your phone cut out or our phone cut out?
[01:38:50.568 --> 01:38:51.269]  Yes, I'm so sorry.
[01:38:51.409 --> 01:38:52.589]  No, no, it's probably on our end.
[01:38:52.609 --> 01:38:53.490]  Lord knows what's going on.
[01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:58.812]  But please continue about, okay, so the hit piece on the BBC, you obviously saw it.
[01:38:59.052 --> 01:39:01.873]  What was the response of the British people you talked to over there who did see it?
[01:39:02.454 --> 01:39:10.545]  It's incredible because I was there on a tour and the BBC knew I was doing this tour for probably five months in advance.
[01:39:11.006 --> 01:39:16.674]  So they actually moved the hit piece from April to February to coincide with my tour.
[01:39:16.714 --> 01:39:18.176]  I'm not saying the purpose of it.
[01:39:18.756 --> 01:39:25.863]  Well, they also kept claiming that all of the families hate the 9-11 truthers when Bill Doyle... Big lie, big lie.
[01:39:25.903 --> 01:39:27.024]  That's actually what I did.
[01:39:27.084 --> 01:39:29.086]  I went on radio and said, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
[01:39:29.126 --> 01:39:29.947]  Who are these people?
[01:39:29.967 --> 01:39:35.732]  I have, you know, dozens and dozens of people that I can produce that are supporting our quiet.
[01:39:35.812 --> 01:39:39.115]  Well, Bill Doyle, the head of the Biggest Victims Family Group,
[01:39:41.611 --> 01:39:43.972]  He lost his son, Joey Doyle.
[01:39:44.613 --> 01:39:46.334]  The majority of them think it's an inside job.
[01:39:46.374 --> 01:39:47.134]  He's the head of the group.
[01:39:47.154 --> 01:39:48.435]  He believes it's an inside job.
[01:39:48.775 --> 01:39:51.737]  I mean, there's all these victims and their families at the events.
[01:39:51.997 --> 01:39:53.278]  They've marched around the White House.
[01:39:53.318 --> 01:39:53.798]  You've been there.
[01:39:53.818 --> 01:39:55.279]  They've marched around Ground Zero.
[01:39:55.499 --> 01:40:00.002]  And the media totally ignores them and gets the minority of them up on TV to say they hate us.
[01:40:00.682 --> 01:40:05.785]  And then that program said there were no cops or anybody who thought it was an inside job.
[01:40:05.825 --> 01:40:07.146]  Meanwhile, we sent them cops.
[01:40:08.147 --> 01:40:12.650]  Who had been told they were going to blow up Building 7 and they wouldn't interview him.
[01:40:12.911 --> 01:40:22.278]  Add to that, like I said, I was there in London when they did this, and I said, listen, you don't have an equal balance piece.
[01:40:22.719 --> 01:40:23.219]  I'm here.
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:24.660]  Let's do one.
[01:40:25.201 --> 01:40:26.182]  And they didn't want to.
[01:40:26.622 --> 01:40:27.623]  They actually said no.
[01:40:28.003 --> 01:40:36.370]  I will be on every radio show, like I said, for the BBC network, and they would have me on for half an hour, sometimes an hour.
[01:40:37.126 --> 01:40:38.487]  And it was not an attack.
[01:40:38.987 --> 01:40:43.230]  Actually, they let me speak, and I had support from the people on the radio station.
[01:40:43.290 --> 01:40:49.193]  As a matter of fact, we had a three-camera crew recording every presentation, so they would not edit it.
[01:40:49.394 --> 01:40:53.156]  And if they edited it, we would have the proof on the tape of what was said.
[01:40:53.916 --> 01:40:56.118]  But the funny thing is that we never had to stop the cameras.
[01:40:56.158 --> 01:40:59.900]  I also saw you on BBC television, but it was only about a three-minute interview.
[01:41:00.788 --> 01:41:17.415]  Yes, yes, well actually, and the only one, the only, from interviews that we receive, usually two and three, I'm sorry, two and one page spreads on the first six or seven pages of almost every local newspaper.
[01:41:17.435 --> 01:41:21.657]  The only one that was kind of an attacking one was one in Glasgow.
[01:41:22.239 --> 01:41:29.362]  Because the lady said, you know, that I produced a master key, and how did she know if that key wasn't the actual key for my drinking cabinet?
[01:41:29.643 --> 01:41:31.043]  You know, kind of an offending thing.
[01:41:31.103 --> 01:41:33.845]  Yeah, but it's admitted you help the police and firemen get into the building.
[01:41:34.545 --> 01:41:37.046]  And they go up in the stairwells, and what are they talking about?
[01:41:37.686 --> 01:41:47.451]  Well, actually, the funny thing is that most of the presentation, we have the police, the local police, and the local firemen being there as guests of my presentation.
[01:41:48.071 --> 01:41:51.393]  And they were all supportive, as a matter of fact,
[01:41:52.014 --> 01:42:01.076]  In Ipswich, we have the local sheriff, the top sheriff, going over there and actually opening for me and closing for me.
[01:42:01.136 --> 01:42:01.656]  How's that?
[01:42:04.057 --> 01:42:07.357]  The support all over the world has been amazing.
[01:42:07.457 --> 01:42:11.318]  It's here that we are getting these attacks, these hit pieces.
[01:42:11.338 --> 01:42:20.420]  I'm going now to Malaysia again to meet with the Prime Minister again, and I'm going to Penang to meet with the people in Penang, the government in Penang.
[01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:24.435]  So, you know, the interest is overwhelming outside of the country.
[01:42:25.055 --> 01:42:30.797]  Well, 9-11 truth has won domestically and internationally, but you're right, the domestic propaganda is amazing.
[01:42:31.258 --> 01:42:35.039]  But a lot of the police and firemen we talk to now here know the truth as well, William.
[01:42:35.811 --> 01:42:36.492]  That is correct.
[01:42:36.672 --> 01:42:37.172]  That is correct.
[01:42:37.252 --> 01:42:43.157]  And we have gathered as much evidence and as much interviews as possible to show the support.
[01:42:43.477 --> 01:42:51.823]  And we are going to make that available, either through your website, prisonplanet.com, or my website, 911keymaster.com.
[01:42:51.984 --> 01:42:56.327]  Just keep checking, because as we digitize them, we're going to be posting them up.
[01:42:57.837 --> 01:42:58.517]  Absolutely.
[01:42:58.877 --> 01:43:03.559]  Now again, tell folks at 911keymaster.com and you've got, how long is that presentation?
[01:43:03.579 --> 01:43:04.919]  You gave an excellent presentation.
[01:43:04.939 --> 01:43:06.799]  That's a 56 minute presentation.
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:08.020]  56 minutes.
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:08.880]  I think you had more time.
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:11.361]  I mean, I guess you just cut it down to the most powerful info.
[01:43:11.941 --> 01:43:12.141]  Yes.
[01:43:12.801 --> 01:43:16.002]  And actually it has more camera views.
[01:43:16.082 --> 01:43:17.802]  The initial one was three camera views.
[01:43:17.842 --> 01:43:20.403]  This one has five camera views, which is good.
[01:43:21.199 --> 01:43:22.499]  I don't think I was ever mad.
[01:43:46.324 --> 01:43:58.515]  I wasn't mad at you personally, I was mad at the whole thing, and I was mad at the hit piece, and saying we have no evidence of Building 7, and I'm just, just, you know, I get so angry at their baloney.
[01:43:59.185 --> 01:44:06.250]  I understand and I feel the same way and I, you know, remember I'm not going to be tricked in a situation where I'm actually going to hurt the people there.
[01:44:06.311 --> 01:44:10.234]  No, I know, you're good and you've had a lot of opportunities to do that and you haven't.
[01:44:10.254 --> 01:44:19.200]  In fact, you've exposed, and I should have remembered this, you have exposed the disinfo people with the space beams and the no planes and they think it's real funny what they're doing.
[01:44:19.821 --> 01:44:22.663]  I remember... I think it's ridiculous what they're doing.
[01:44:22.703 --> 01:44:23.964]  I think it's hurting the movement.
[01:44:24.364 --> 01:44:25.606]  I think, actually.
[01:44:26.007 --> 01:44:36.663]  I spoke on every presentation that I did in the UK against these theories, and actually the information has gotten over there and has made us a laughable fuck sometimes.
[01:44:37.125 --> 01:44:39.726]  With these presenters, and I tell them, listen, no, no, hold on.
[01:44:40.026 --> 01:44:42.207]  There's a division within the ranks here.
[01:44:42.247 --> 01:44:43.307]  There's two different groups.
[01:44:43.867 --> 01:44:50.709]  The people that are really talking about conspiracy theories and the people that are talking about the real conspiracy theory came from the government first.
[01:44:50.829 --> 01:44:53.670]  The government put out the first theory.
[01:44:53.850 --> 01:44:55.231]  Yes, it's total bull.
[01:44:55.551 --> 01:45:01.573]  You're going to have, in any situation where you're trying to expose a crime, debunkers trying to plant
[01:45:02.233 --> 01:45:04.674]  False evidence to lead you down rabbit trails.
[01:45:05.094 --> 01:45:11.557]  You're going to have people that try to plant stuff on innocent people and groups so that it's going to be discredited.
[01:45:11.597 --> 01:45:13.577]  I mean, you don't think they're just going to not fight us here, folks.
[01:45:14.058 --> 01:45:23.021]  I mean, they're going to come up with ridiculous stuff that blood-drinking lizards from planet Kluklklop fired, you know, giant Twinkie lasers at the towers.
[01:45:23.201 --> 01:45:24.362]  It's not going to work.
[01:45:24.402 --> 01:45:25.602]  The people see right through it.
[01:45:25.962 --> 01:45:27.483]  The good news is it's not stopping 9-11 Truth.
[01:45:28.928 --> 01:45:32.711]  Correct, and listen, it's growing exponentially.
[01:45:33.012 --> 01:45:37.155]  It has gone bigger and bigger and bigger than we ever expected.
[01:45:37.555 --> 01:45:40.798]  The support internationally is non-stopping.
[01:45:41.159 --> 01:45:51.968]  I tell you, my experience, people don't see the experience that I'm going through because I'm the one out there going to these presentations, talking to the people directly, people that are not even related.
[01:45:52.188 --> 01:45:59.731]  And by the way, other governments staged terror attacks throughout history, so worldwide people are waking up to government-sponsored terror.
[01:46:00.051 --> 01:46:12.597]  A key tool of the elite that they've gone to too many times in their little bag of tricks is now losing its effect, so they're having to switch over to fake global warming hysteria or, you know, other situations.
[01:46:12.617 --> 01:46:16.418]  When I gave you that interview with Annie Michon and David Shaler,
[01:46:17.918 --> 01:46:23.600]  People that were involved with MI5 on actually creating false flag terrorism.
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:25.341]  It's coming from the horse's mouth.
[01:46:25.741 --> 01:46:32.984]  So if these people have come out with that kind of information, you know, what will the government do to our own people?
[01:46:33.004 --> 01:46:34.264]  It's non-stoppable.
[01:46:34.805 --> 01:46:38.086]  You know, so we have to take a position and stand to make a change.
[01:46:38.542 --> 01:46:38.903]  I don't
[01:46:50.272 --> 01:46:54.953]  He has told you they're going to talk to you about 9-11 and you're going to be going public.
[01:46:55.073 --> 01:47:06.496]  I know about another huge meeting happening in Hollywood tonight with a bunch of big stars with strategy on what they're going to do concerning 9-11.
[01:47:06.776 --> 01:47:07.917]  I'll go ahead and let that out of the bag.
[01:47:07.937 --> 01:47:08.717]  We'll see what happens.
[01:47:08.977 --> 01:47:09.777]  There's no details.
[01:47:10.097 --> 01:47:12.478]  I have the details, but I can't give them to you.
[01:47:12.558 --> 01:47:13.218]  There's that.
[01:47:14.398 --> 01:47:38.452]  That could be breaking very soon and William send me that email to contact that person and I'll just you know simply say hey I know you're talking to Willie if you'd like to talk to me or you'd like to go privately confer I won't go public with it to try to get them to go public later on their own terms it looks like that's pretty much happening regardless and William again I really appreciate you and I kind of got broadsided and bushwhacked with this
[01:47:38.832 --> 01:47:39.232]  We're good to go.
[01:48:04.677 --> 01:48:05.298]  I will do that.
[01:48:05.378 --> 01:48:08.720]  And again, the website is 911keymaster.com.
[01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:09.240]  All right.
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:10.281]  Thank you, William Rodriguez.
[01:48:11.181 --> 01:48:12.442]  And our prayers go with your wife.
[01:48:13.163 --> 01:48:13.823]  Thank you so much.
[01:48:13.843 --> 01:48:14.303]  You bet.
[01:48:15.144 --> 01:48:16.705]  Now, I've already done an hour and 49 minutes.
[01:48:16.725 --> 01:48:19.207]  I said we'd have open phones today, but something happened.
[01:48:19.567 --> 01:48:21.028]  Now we're going to have open phones.
[01:48:21.068 --> 01:48:24.590]  And I did a pretty good job a few days ago with Corky taking about 15 calls in the third hour.
[01:48:25.271 --> 01:48:33.176]  I'm going to just take call after call after call after call after call after call interspersed with just a few headlines, other news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:48:33.971 --> 01:48:39.433]  Okay, but it's been an hour and 49 minutes of showtime and I haven't plugged the video yet.
[01:48:40.613 --> 01:48:41.914]  These are powerful films I've made.
[01:48:42.614 --> 01:48:44.054]  I've made 15 of them.
[01:48:44.134 --> 01:48:45.415]  It's how I fund my operation.
[01:48:45.615 --> 01:48:50.297]  They're the most powerful films out there on government-sponsored terror on the New World Order, in my opinion.
[01:48:51.457 --> 01:48:52.437]  Some of the most powerful films.
[01:48:52.477 --> 01:48:56.098]  I'd say Terror Storm is the best overall to understand government-sponsored terror.
[01:48:56.118 --> 01:48:57.639]  It doesn't just cover 9-11, it covers it all.
[01:48:58.594 --> 01:48:59.635]  There's other great films as well.
[01:48:59.655 --> 01:49:02.337]  I don't want to say I've got the best, period, but it's the best in that genre.
[01:49:03.378 --> 01:49:08.662]  America, Freedom to Fascism is the best on the Federal Reserve System and the IRS and who the masters are.
[01:49:08.802 --> 01:49:12.025]  Get America, Freedom to Fascism at InfoWars.com today.

[01:49:36.516 --> 01:49:40.798]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:49:42.619 --> 01:49:43.779]  Come in for the big win.
[01:49:44.119 --> 01:49:45.480]  Join us in the info war.
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:46.420]  Get the films.
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:47.440]  Burn the copies.
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:48.381]  Make the copies.
[01:49:48.681 --> 01:49:51.182]  And engage the New World Order at point blank range.
[01:49:56.192 --> 01:50:01.698]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.059 --> 01:50:09.647]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.399 --> 01:50:17.463]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.843 --> 01:50:29.309]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:33.511]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.531 --> 01:50:35.472]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.812 --> 01:50:39.594]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:53:04.398 --> 01:53:10.202]  You know, sometimes Satan... He comes as a man of peace!
[01:53:29.528 --> 01:53:31.529]  Hell yeah!
[01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:33.150]  Welcome back!
[01:53:52.722 --> 01:53:56.267]  Alright, I'm going to go to Alec and Shanna.
[01:53:56.347 --> 01:53:56.928]  Is it Shannon?
[01:53:57.529 --> 01:53:58.970]  They've been holding for eons.
[01:53:59.191 --> 01:54:03.056]  And then we're going to get to Matt and Peter and Ed and everybody else.
[01:54:04.698 --> 01:54:07.302]  I am carrying a new film.
[01:54:08.917 --> 01:54:11.601]  It's the American Mysteries Part 2.
[01:54:11.701 --> 01:54:12.042]  You know what?
[01:54:12.062 --> 01:54:13.784]  I'm just going to get the calls and I'm going to cover it later.
[01:54:13.824 --> 01:54:14.845]  It's a big new film.
[01:54:14.886 --> 01:54:17.449]  This is Part 2 of the Mysteries film.
[01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:18.511]  It's incredible.
[01:54:18.531 --> 01:54:19.412]  It won a bunch of awards.
[01:54:19.432 --> 01:54:20.654]  The last one won a bunch of awards.
[01:54:20.674 --> 01:54:21.915]  We got it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:54:21.955 --> 01:54:22.496]  It just came out.
[01:54:22.516 --> 01:54:22.777]  There it is.
[01:54:23.577 --> 01:54:28.220]  Let's go ahead and take a call here from Alec in New York.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:29.261]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:54:29.861 --> 01:54:30.522]  Alex, greetings.
[01:54:30.542 --> 01:54:31.042]  How are you?
[01:54:31.222 --> 01:54:31.583]  Good, sir.
[01:54:31.623 --> 01:54:32.183]  What's on your mind?
[01:54:32.483 --> 01:54:39.688]  Well, I've been listening for a really, really long time, and the best way I can explain myself is that I'm the Bizarro Troy.
[01:54:40.469 --> 01:54:41.549]  I'm up here in New York.
[01:54:41.569 --> 01:54:46.753]  That means, I believe, basically, that we're at the precipice of
[01:54:48.405 --> 01:54:50.727]  You're the Bizarro, Troy?
[01:54:50.747 --> 01:54:52.429]  Like he's Superman and you're Bizarro?
[01:54:52.449 --> 01:54:55.511]  How about you're Superman and he's Bizarro?
[01:54:55.531 --> 01:54:57.133]  How about I'm Alec?
[01:54:57.173 --> 01:54:57.713]  You know what I mean?
[01:54:57.733 --> 01:54:58.654]  That's all I need.
[01:54:58.694 --> 01:54:59.415]  But here's the deal.
[01:54:59.455 --> 01:55:01.417]  I was there yesterday at ABC.
[01:55:01.977 --> 01:55:13.948]  I went and I met Luke and Tony and Rob and Anthony and learned a lot more about Dan Wallace and I realized I was beside him at 9-11 on the 5th anniversary this year.
[01:55:15.183 --> 01:55:24.026]  Basically, I just want to call to try, and I'm obviously really nervous, but I just hope that everyone listening can keep high level.
[01:55:24.466 --> 01:55:29.468]  Alex, I know you got hit with it right before you got on air, but we have to remain high level.
[01:55:30.448 --> 01:55:38.991]  And I know you are, I know where you come from, but right now is when we have to use everyone who's listening, Alex, all the people you can't talk about.
[01:55:39.631 --> 01:55:40.892]  Hollywood is the biggest
[01:55:42.984 --> 01:55:45.396]  Production Center on the planet Earth.
[01:55:45.637 --> 01:55:46.642]  This is the Infowar.
[01:55:47.347 --> 01:55:48.928]  You are not going to lose.
[01:55:49.048 --> 01:55:49.969]  We're not going to lose.
[01:55:50.189 --> 01:55:51.489]  It's just impossible.
[01:55:51.850 --> 01:55:52.610]  Look at these people.
[01:55:52.630 --> 01:55:55.812]  We're trying to turn their propaganda arm against them.
[01:55:55.872 --> 01:55:59.334]  We're trying to turn them over to the good side, away from the dark side.
[01:55:59.374 --> 01:56:00.354]  It's working.
[01:56:00.875 --> 01:56:01.695]  It's happening.
[01:56:01.775 --> 01:56:03.336]  And we're not just focused there.
[01:56:03.636 --> 01:56:06.378]  We're fighting on hundreds of fronts.
[01:56:06.858 --> 01:56:07.678]  I'm with you.
[01:56:07.738 --> 01:56:08.319]  I was there.
[01:56:08.339 --> 01:56:10.300]  I was with those guys.
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:12.041]  We shall go on to the end.
[01:56:12.461 --> 01:56:13.882]  Whatever the cost may be.
[01:56:14.462 --> 01:56:15.182]  Here's the deal.
[01:56:15.402 --> 01:56:16.203]  I've got a quote for you.
[01:56:16.818 --> 01:56:19.941]  Let us raise a standard to which the wise and honest can repair.
[01:56:20.181 --> 01:56:21.542]  The event is in the hands of God.
[01:56:21.562 --> 01:56:22.303]  You know who said that?
[01:56:23.884 --> 01:56:24.605]  JFK?
[01:56:25.145 --> 01:56:25.826]  George Washington.
[01:56:25.946 --> 01:56:27.047]  George Washington, okay.
[01:56:27.147 --> 01:56:30.329]  I've seen JFK say that.
[01:56:30.370 --> 01:56:31.751]  I bet he was quoting George Washington.
[01:56:33.132 --> 01:56:33.792]  I don't doubt it.
[01:56:34.413 --> 01:56:37.315]  You know, we lost all the... I don't know.
[01:56:37.576 --> 01:56:45.062]  Alex, I just want to keep you... let you know that those you don't know about yet, we are here and we completely support you every step of the way.
[01:56:45.555 --> 01:56:46.555]  And there's no way.
[01:56:46.595 --> 01:56:48.836]  I'm a North Carolinian, so I'm a country boy, too.
[01:56:48.876 --> 01:56:49.576]  I know what's coming.
[01:56:49.996 --> 01:56:50.876]  And I feel fine.
[01:56:50.916 --> 01:56:52.377]  But you just keep it up, brother.
[01:56:52.577 --> 01:56:53.297]  Stay high level.
[01:56:53.837 --> 01:56:54.838]  I hear you, my friend.
[01:56:54.858 --> 01:56:57.178]  I really appreciate the call.
[01:56:57.518 --> 01:56:59.019]  I'm going to be fair to the next caller.
[01:56:59.039 --> 01:57:03.380]  So we'll go to break, come back, go to her, and then go to everybody else.
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:04.420]  And what a novel idea.
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:05.780]  Here's the toll-free number to join us.
[01:57:05.801 --> 01:57:06.701]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:06.721 --> 01:57:06.781]  800-259-9231.
[01:57:06.821 --> 01:57:07.241]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:15.743 --> 01:57:18.626]  And this is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:18.726 --> 01:57:21.429]  We're here live Monday through Friday, 11 to 2.
[01:57:23.210 --> 01:57:24.251]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[01:57:24.652 --> 01:57:30.897]  And simulcast on the internet 24-7 at Infowars.com.
[01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:38.224]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.852 --> 01:57:50.493]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.153 --> 01:57:52.234]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.935 --> 01:57:54.056]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.696 --> 01:57:55.497]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.277 --> 01:57:57.138]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.158 --> 01:58:01.681]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.022 --> 01:58:06.145]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.549 --> 01:58:13.371]  Man is made in the image of God.
[01:58:14.361 --> 01:58:19.545]  And that means that what we imagine, what we attempt to build, we can construct.
[01:58:21.206 --> 01:58:22.207]  And we can destroy.
[01:58:22.227 --> 01:58:29.152]  Now we're going to bring down the New World Order with God's help and we're going to build and move forward as a human society.
[01:58:29.172 --> 01:58:37.479]  And we're not going to listen to the bought and paid for churches that tell you to lay down and you can't affect change and just hope for more evil because that means Jesus is coming.
[01:58:38.146 --> 01:58:40.987]  It doesn't matter whether Jesus is coming this week or ten years from now.
[01:58:41.667 --> 01:58:53.089]  I love Jesus, and I'm going to stand up for the meek and the weak, and I'm going to fight evil, ladies and gentlemen, because beauty is ours, consequence belongs to God, and may the heavens fall, right needs to be done.
[01:58:54.089 --> 01:58:55.870]  So you don't have any excuse out there.
[01:58:56.010 --> 01:58:58.730]  Shauna in Texas, then Matt, Peter, Ed, George, and others.
[01:58:59.010 --> 01:59:00.251]  Go ahead, Shauna, you're on the air.
[01:59:00.891 --> 01:59:01.551]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:59:01.571 --> 01:59:02.751]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:59:02.791 --> 01:59:03.451]  Thanks for holding.
[01:59:03.471 --> 01:59:04.471]  We had a lot of breaking news.
[01:59:04.911 --> 01:59:06.252]  Yeah, I was listening to it.
[01:59:06.312 --> 01:59:07.292]  I enjoy it greatly.
[01:59:07.845 --> 01:59:13.327]  I just want to let you know there's thousands of us out here that are standing beside you and keeping you in our prayers.
[01:59:13.907 --> 01:59:14.567]  Don't give up.
[01:59:14.667 --> 01:59:21.209]  I know that it's aggravating for you, and I know that you get so emotional about the tyranny that's going on in our country.
[01:59:22.089 --> 01:59:23.129]  Stand fast, brother.
[01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:25.750]  We're standing beside you and praying for you.
[01:59:27.294 --> 01:59:36.578]  I'm pretty calm when I'm not on air and when I'm working, but then it takes energy to get on air and cover this stuff and to really use your brain hour after hour.
[01:59:36.618 --> 01:59:37.778]  Not that I do that good of a job.
[01:59:38.078 --> 01:59:42.820]  And then I just tend to, in the height and alertness, then just get super hyped.
[01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:45.221]  So it's not like even in person I'm like this.
[01:59:45.241 --> 01:59:47.282]  This is just what happens when I get on air.
[01:59:47.950 --> 01:59:48.751]  Hey, I understand.
[01:59:48.811 --> 01:59:52.256]  I broadcast live on Family Rights Radio and... Oh, good!
[01:59:52.457 --> 01:59:56.683]  You know, the tyranny out there, I get so angry and frustrated and it just doesn't seem like...
[01:59:57.113 --> 01:59:59.314]  It's ever gonna, you know, change.
[02:00:00.114 --> 02:00:07.577]  At an instinctive, animal-based level, you have every right to physically go after these people, but you know that's their game and they'd win if you did that right now.
[02:00:07.977 --> 02:00:12.679]  So see, there's also this, this, this, this, this, I mean, frankly, it's a violent tendency.
[02:00:12.719 --> 02:00:19.822]  I mean, it's a, we, we, we are being attacked, we are cornered, being fed on by a bunch of vampires, and we want to stomp their heads in.
[02:00:20.622 --> 02:00:23.603]  You're absolutely right, and I appreciate, you know, all you're doing for Marty.
[02:00:24.051 --> 02:00:25.291]  I talked with the man yesterday.
[02:00:25.331 --> 02:00:30.693]  He's a fantastic person, spiritually and product-wise, too.
[02:00:31.793 --> 02:00:37.574]  I just hope you can come join us on Family Rights Radio in the near future.
[02:00:38.014 --> 02:00:39.835]  I just love you and God bless you.
[02:00:40.075 --> 02:00:41.255]  Have you guys contacted us?
[02:00:42.236 --> 02:00:42.556]  I have.
[02:00:42.596 --> 02:00:46.637]  I've called numerous times, but I don't know why my messages don't get to you.
[02:00:46.777 --> 02:00:49.117]  Here's the problem, literally, and I'm not exaggerating.
[02:00:49.957 --> 02:00:51.958]  Thirty, forty media contacts a day.
[02:00:52.902 --> 02:00:56.905]  And I just randomly go, literally, sometimes in the stack, I go, okay, I'll do this.
[02:00:57.285 --> 02:01:05.411]  Like, I went down and talked to just like, I don't know, it was like two classes were in there, probably 60 students today, because it was down the street at St.
[02:01:05.471 --> 02:01:12.957]  Edward's, plus there'd been some censorship down there by the paper and stuff, so I thought I'd go into the belly of the beast, and here was the head of the paper, you know, there.
[02:01:13.037 --> 02:01:15.599]  But that's a whole other story, and bugging you guys.
[02:01:15.619 --> 02:01:17.760]  I mean, I understand, you're just totally busy.
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:21.343]  Well, yeah, and then I've said I can't do radio interviews right now, or I can't make this film.
[02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:27.693]  A big film that's professionally done and highly effective and filled with truth is like a hydrogen bomb.
[02:01:27.733 --> 02:01:29.474]  It'll really hurt the New World Order in the fight.
[02:01:30.034 --> 02:01:35.258]  Or I can just all day man a machine gun shooting at the enemy at the grassroots level doing radio interviews.
[02:01:35.598 --> 02:01:40.101]  Sometimes I've got to go into the laboratory and try to really build super weapons.
[02:01:40.741 --> 02:01:42.443]  And so I try to do everything.
[02:01:42.643 --> 02:01:48.247]  I'm like manning a machine gun in a foxhole while with my right hand trying to build a hydrogen bomb.
[02:01:48.267 --> 02:01:51.589]  I understand because I've got all your videos
[02:01:52.463 --> 02:01:59.145]  I make copies of them, I hand them out to our schools, especially our private schools that they will actually teach the truth in.
[02:02:02.445 --> 02:02:08.526]  American Defazism, I've talked with Aaron Russo and Ron Paul that's running for president.
[02:02:08.586 --> 02:02:10.967]  Well, fire out the website for the radio network you're part of.
[02:02:12.287 --> 02:02:14.328]  It's familyrightsradio.net.
[02:02:14.888 --> 02:02:17.008]  Well, listen, we're going to punch you out, but call back again.
[02:02:17.028 --> 02:02:18.369]  Hopefully you won't have to hold us long.
[02:02:18.389 --> 02:02:20.289]  We're going to come back and talk to Matt and many others.
[02:02:21.286 --> 02:02:26.071]  Before the New York Times quotes me out of context, it's an analogy.
[02:02:26.371 --> 02:02:27.092]  It's a parable.
[02:02:27.772 --> 02:02:30.195]  I'm not really firing a machine gun in a machine gun nest.
[02:02:30.515 --> 02:02:32.357]  I'm not really building an H-bomb.
[02:02:33.318 --> 02:02:36.901]  I'm talking about an H-bomb against the enemy's lives.
[02:02:39.103 --> 02:02:42.567]  To blow open their main dividing wall and let us in.
[02:02:45.874 --> 02:02:50.838]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:02:51.158 --> 02:02:56.582]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:02:56.622 --> 02:03:00.926]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:03:01.266 --> 02:03:04.268]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:03:04.588 --> 02:03:08.011]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:03:08.331 --> 02:03:17.693]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:03:17.953 --> 02:03:21.454]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:03:21.694 --> 02:03:28.796]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:03:48.124 --> 02:03:53.589]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:53.969 --> 02:04:01.596]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:09.353]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.753 --> 02:04:21.258]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.498 --> 02:04:25.160]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:27.381]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.721 --> 02:04:31.563]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:46.963 --> 02:04:49.085]  Does this sound bring on a sudden onset of fear?
[02:04:49.525 --> 02:04:51.447]  A fear of not knowing who's on the other end?
[02:04:51.747 --> 02:04:56.191]  Do you avoid picking up the phone knowing it's just going to be another harassing phone call from a debt collector?
[02:04:56.351 --> 02:05:00.815]  Do you resent your daily trips to the mailbox knowing it will be flooded with notices from creditors?
[02:05:01.115 --> 02:05:04.077]  Over 1 million credit card holders will declare bankruptcy this year.
[02:05:04.318 --> 02:05:06.680]  Learn how to legally eliminate your credit card debt.
[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:07.420]  Want to know more?
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:07.981]  Call 920-293-8024.
[02:05:08.021 --> 02:05:08.321]  That's 920-293-8024.
[02:05:15.712 --> 02:05:18.194]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:05:18.655 --> 02:05:20.556]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:05:21.277 --> 02:05:24.439]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:31.565]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[02:05:32.346 --> 02:05:34.567]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[02:05:34.928 --> 02:05:35.368]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:05:35.428 --> 02:05:36.849]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:05:45.385 --> 02:05:50.411]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.791 --> 02:05:53.093]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:53.113 --> 02:05:59.080]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:04.746]  I'm gonna go to Matt and Peter and Ed and George and many others here in just a moment.
[02:06:06.946 --> 02:06:13.639]  John Connor wanted to fight the New World Order but not use his real name and then he just said, so what?
[02:06:13.659 --> 02:06:18.409]  Why don't I just use my real name in the fight against the New World Order?
[02:06:19.884 --> 02:06:32.315]  And so here he is, ladies and gentlemen, to comment on the Page Six hit piece on Charlie Sheen, Rosie O'Donnell, myself, many others, but also to now publicly announce himself.
[02:06:32.815 --> 02:06:35.558]  Zorro will now give you his true identity.
[02:06:35.578 --> 02:06:39.421]  The man in the steel mask will now unveil himself to you.
[02:06:40.282 --> 02:06:43.044]  He is, the Batman will take off his mask now.
[02:06:43.725 --> 02:06:47.468]  John Connor, formerly known as John Connor, tell folks your real name.
[02:06:48.576 --> 02:06:50.098]  Real name is Mark Schuldyce.
[02:06:50.118 --> 02:06:51.399]  You can call me Mark Dice.
[02:06:51.499 --> 02:06:57.105]  Nobody seems to know how to spell my last name, pronounce it, or type it into a search engine.
[02:06:57.145 --> 02:06:59.868]  Dice is the nickname I've had for quite some time, so...
[02:07:00.580 --> 02:07:01.941]  That's what you guys can just call me, Mark.
[02:07:01.981 --> 02:07:27.530]  I got sick of calling myself John, being called John, and it was a good pseudonym to write by, a good blogger handle, but now with the success that I'm having, I just would rather just have you guys call me Mark, and markdice.com points to theresistancemanifesto.com, and I'll comment on the hit pieces from page six, and then I have an important announcement about a new 9-11 Truth Jam YouTube contest that will be getting into a thousand dollar
[02:07:28.194 --> 02:07:28.675]  We're good to go.
[02:07:42.347 --> 02:07:44.288]  Shout out to people with some megaphones.
[02:07:45.289 --> 02:07:50.252]  Basically, take your X-Wing into the trench and blast some enemy emplacements in the Info War.
[02:07:50.812 --> 02:07:57.176]  Essentially, post a video of you and your friends getting the word out and the best, most educational video wins a thousand bucks.
[02:07:57.216 --> 02:07:59.497]  The details are on MarkDice.com.
[02:07:59.517 --> 02:08:01.278]  There's a few rules that need to be abided by.
[02:08:01.298 --> 02:08:06.862]  The winner will be announced on my show, Resistance Radio, Sunday on Tax Day, April 15th.
[02:08:06.902 --> 02:08:07.662]  Second place will get $500.
[02:08:09.110 --> 02:08:10.130]  The money's not coming from me.
[02:08:10.150 --> 02:08:13.171]  I only wish I had that much money to be encouraging others.
[02:08:13.231 --> 02:08:19.733]  I had an anonymous benefactor donate a prize for the listeners to encourage everybody to get out there and get the word out.
[02:08:19.753 --> 02:08:20.734]  That's always nice.
[02:08:20.754 --> 02:08:28.636]  Hit the streets, get out the word to the strangers, get off your computers, and really just bring it to the crowds.
[02:08:29.497 --> 02:08:31.217]  You have done well, my apprentice.
[02:08:32.498 --> 02:08:33.478]  I'll quit being stupid.
[02:08:33.758 --> 02:08:36.879]  Okay, give me your take on the page six thing.
[02:08:38.092 --> 02:08:39.573]  It's fully expected.
[02:08:39.633 --> 02:08:42.554]  Page 6 is nothing but a hit piece gossip column.
[02:08:42.594 --> 02:08:46.496]  I don't think there's an encouraging word that's ever been printed in that column, ever.
[02:08:47.116 --> 02:08:49.477]  They were the first column to attack Charlie Sheen.
[02:08:49.878 --> 02:08:52.599]  They attacked Christine Ebersole when she came forward.
[02:08:53.498 --> 02:09:13.053]  And now, of course, following perfectly in line, they are now smearing Rosie O'Donnell, and of course they can't... Now, the neocons tried to recruit me about four years ago, again, and I'm not going to get into it, but an associate of the head of Page Six was like, hey, I'm friends with Page Six, watch this.
[02:09:13.453 --> 02:09:21.699]  And there was a positive blurb about me, as I was kind of being, the attempt to induct me in a neocondom, and I was just testing it and talking to the person.
[02:09:22.316 --> 02:09:22.817]  Yeah, I think.
[02:09:35.567 --> 02:09:38.090]  Oh, look, I just revealed something pretty big there, John.
[02:09:38.611 --> 02:09:46.862]  Well, they also have allegations of people being bribed to keep them out of the column or being bribed to write favorable stories about them.
[02:09:46.902 --> 02:09:50.306]  And Page Six broke a story about me about a year and a half ago.
[02:09:50.406 --> 02:09:51.588]  You know, I'd forgotten that.
[02:09:51.668 --> 02:09:52.028]  Hold on.
[02:09:52.088 --> 02:09:53.170]  I never thought about that.
[02:09:54.535 --> 02:09:58.636]  I remember seeing that in the news, the big bribery scandal, and one guy went to jail, remember?
[02:09:59.116 --> 02:09:59.756]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:09:59.796 --> 02:10:09.138]  They were getting bribes to stop writing hit pieces about people, and I believe people were paying them to hype their careers in the Page Six gossip column.
[02:10:09.158 --> 02:10:10.959]  That's the kind of people that we're dealing with here.
[02:10:11.019 --> 02:10:12.639]  Well, that's how big Page Six is.
[02:10:13.419 --> 02:10:14.679]  It's the biggest thing there is.
[02:10:14.939 --> 02:10:17.340]  Yeah, in New York and around the world, absolutely.
[02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:19.260]  Yeah, I mean, that's what they read.
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:21.521]  And of course, the New York Post is all over L.A.
[02:10:21.541 --> 02:10:22.501]  That's what all the stars read.
[02:10:23.522 --> 02:10:31.108]  They go right to page six with coffee every morning and this is just amazing that this is all going on.
[02:10:31.812 --> 02:10:34.214]  And they couldn't even get Loose Change correct.
[02:10:34.234 --> 02:10:36.656]  They said it was a YouTube documentary.
[02:10:37.097 --> 02:10:40.259]  They can't even get Mike Rivero's name correctly.
[02:10:40.279 --> 02:10:49.627]  I think that's on purpose, though, as an attempt so you can't find it when you look for it, because it's an hour and a half film, 90 to 100 minutes, depending on which version.
[02:10:50.548 --> 02:10:54.051]  So when you look for Rivero, you look for Matt Rivero instead of Michael, you can't find it.
[02:10:56.454 --> 02:10:58.355]  Well, I do have to compliment Page Six.
[02:10:58.375 --> 02:11:04.458]  They did a story on me about a year and a half ago, but again, it was just another smear story to Jessica Simpson when I called her a singing stripper.
[02:11:04.478 --> 02:11:06.779]  And again, nothing positive coming out of the page.
[02:11:06.799 --> 02:11:08.300]  But see, that's because it's neocon.
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:09.381]  I've talked to them, okay?
[02:11:09.421 --> 02:11:10.661]  I'm not going to get into it, folks.
[02:11:11.302 --> 02:11:13.583]  But, and I was also told how handsome I was.
[02:11:13.983 --> 02:11:14.844]  Let's just leave it at that.
[02:11:15.424 --> 02:11:15.784]  Okay?
[02:11:16.264 --> 02:11:18.025]  And this is unbelievable, okay?
[02:11:18.065 --> 02:11:19.786]  That's all I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:19.806 --> 02:11:21.367]  This is the kind of stuff I just have lived through.
[02:11:23.243 --> 02:11:24.003]  Well, and we need this.
[02:11:24.304 --> 02:11:26.725]  This will hopefully encourage other celebrities to come forward.
[02:11:26.765 --> 02:11:33.368]  Rosie O'Donnell is inching her neck out into the mainstream, but she'll probably comment on this.
[02:11:33.628 --> 02:11:35.149]  I've contacted her people.
[02:11:35.189 --> 02:11:36.650]  I've tried to get her to come on my show.
[02:11:36.670 --> 02:11:37.891]  I've gotten no response.
[02:11:38.011 --> 02:11:43.974]  Yeah, I've been contacting Eversol, and I talked a little bit about Rosie, and I'm not going to say what she said, but that was a month ago.
[02:11:44.054 --> 02:11:45.935]  How do I get Rosie on here?
[02:11:47.395 --> 02:11:52.636]  You know, I've talked to Ebersole about it also, and I'm trying to get her to talk to at least one of us.
[02:11:54.016 --> 02:11:55.057]  I've got no response.
[02:11:55.077 --> 02:11:59.258]  She's going to be meeting with her face-to-face here in the next week or two, and we'll see what happens.
[02:11:59.878 --> 02:12:02.738]  Yeah, well, there's going to be something probably breaking sooner than that.
[02:12:02.778 --> 02:12:08.440]  I've got it from triple sources, and two of the sources are pretty darn good.
[02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:13.201]  There's other celebrities, too, and I mean, I'm sure that you have names that you're keeping in confidence.
[02:12:13.261 --> 02:12:14.521]  People that are on our side,
[02:12:15.106 --> 02:12:16.107]  There's a big secret meeting in L.A.
[02:12:16.127 --> 02:12:17.507]  tonight and we'll see what they decide to do.
[02:12:36.292 --> 02:12:40.093]  I mean, the level of stars that know all about this for years, man.
[02:12:40.153 --> 02:12:41.393]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:12:41.413 --> 02:12:53.356]  Folks, if I told you the names, I could call up tabloids right now, know, because I know the amounts of money I've been offered at $40,000, $50,000, grand, boom, in my hand, folks, for just little pieces of info.
[02:12:53.616 --> 02:12:55.437]  I've got dozens of pieces of info like that.
[02:12:55.777 --> 02:12:58.237]  And it's just how sick all this is.
[02:12:58.957 --> 02:13:05.559]  I'm doing this for 9-11 Truth, folks, that could care less about a bunch of paper money that's not even as valuable as toilet paper in the real world.
[02:13:06.099 --> 02:13:08.981]  And once Loose Change hits theaters, it's going to be undeniable.
[02:13:09.021 --> 02:13:14.765]  This has the potential to be the biggest movie of the summer, to be the number one story.
[02:13:14.785 --> 02:13:23.230]  Well, now that I'm doing nerdly, exactly, now that I'm doing nerdly Star Wars illusions all day, I mean, this will be the proton torpedoes down the exhaust shaft.
[02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:26.793]  This could trump the power of Fahrenheit 9-11.
[02:13:26.833 --> 02:13:28.574]  It's going to be on everybody's mind.
[02:13:28.734 --> 02:13:29.054]  Oh, come on.
[02:13:29.074 --> 02:13:30.035]  I mean, yeah, bigger.
[02:13:30.055 --> 02:13:34.899]  It could be bigger, you know, as box office-wise, but I don't rate it as that, and I agree with you.
[02:13:34.919 --> 02:13:35.960]  I'm not pooping on your statement.
[02:13:36.180 --> 02:13:39.162]  But to elaborate, the effect, though, this will be pure.
[02:13:39.182 --> 02:13:39.983]  This will be real.
[02:13:40.183 --> 02:13:40.983]  This will be big.
[02:13:41.224 --> 02:13:41.864]  Yeah, this is enormous.
[02:13:41.884 --> 02:13:42.985]  You want to see the script, man.
[02:13:43.025 --> 02:13:43.926]  I've had it for two months.
[02:13:44.866 --> 02:13:46.107]  It's going to be incredible.
[02:13:46.167 --> 02:13:48.669]  I emailed Jason just the other day, and I said, I'm getting excited, man.
[02:13:48.709 --> 02:13:50.431]  I can't wait until this hits theaters.
[02:13:50.491 --> 02:13:52.052]  I think it's going to be the number one film
[02:13:52.572 --> 02:13:52.933]  I think so.
[02:14:09.216 --> 02:14:17.264]  I remember six years ago, starting to get info on the 9-11 attacks in July, being aware of it, going public.
[02:14:17.564 --> 02:14:22.889]  I've got to tell you, John Connor, a few complex things make me happy.
[02:14:22.909 --> 02:14:25.831]  I like good food, family, I'm a pretty simple guy.
[02:14:25.851 --> 02:14:29.054]  I like walking around on wet grass in the morning.
[02:14:30.829 --> 02:14:34.534]  I don't want castles.
[02:14:34.574 --> 02:14:35.715]  I don't want fancy cars.
[02:14:35.955 --> 02:14:37.477]  I'm married.
[02:14:37.517 --> 02:14:37.938]  I'm happy.
[02:14:38.298 --> 02:14:42.303]  I could admire a good looking woman but I don't lust after them like I did years ago.
[02:14:42.343 --> 02:14:43.744]  I'm a pretty serious guy.
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:48.702]  I do want to see a big 9-11 film.
[02:14:48.782 --> 02:14:49.884]  I do want to see it happen.
[02:14:49.964 --> 02:14:53.568]  I do want to see the New World Order fall, and I'm so proud.
[02:14:54.229 --> 02:15:02.278]  I mean, to me, it's like a treasure trove, and it's a treasure trove I carry in my heart, in my mind, that I went public on day one.
[02:15:02.478 --> 02:15:03.960]  I lost all those radio stations.
[02:15:03.980 --> 02:15:05.041]  I got demonized.
[02:15:05.062 --> 02:15:06.103]  I sounded like a nut.
[02:15:06.663 --> 02:15:10.204]  And now, all these years later, the New World Order is in deep trouble.
[02:15:10.544 --> 02:15:15.506]  And I'm not giving myself credit, it's everybody together, but I think it's historical.
[02:15:16.346 --> 02:15:23.108]  I mean, especially when we win this thing with God's help, it's like saying, hey, I walked across the U.S.
[02:15:23.148 --> 02:15:25.628]  like Lewis and Clark first, you know what I mean?
[02:15:25.648 --> 02:15:31.470]  Yeah, and that's why I wrote about you in the Manifesto, in the Resistance Manifesto, I give you full credit for starting
[02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:35.252]  And being one of the heads, if not the head, of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:15:35.332 --> 02:15:37.733]  And, you know, you don't need to pat yourself on the back, Alex.
[02:15:37.753 --> 02:15:39.114]  We'll pat yourself on the back.
[02:15:39.134 --> 02:15:40.075]  We'll pat you on the back.
[02:15:40.155 --> 02:15:41.796]  Well, I'm not even wanting the patting, though.
[02:15:42.057 --> 02:15:44.438]  I mean, all I'm saying is to me it is a treasure.
[02:15:44.679 --> 02:15:50.183]  And it's also a scary treasure to open the box and look at it and all the black stuff swirling around it because it's very dangerous.
[02:15:51.603 --> 02:15:57.125]  My whole point is that it's a testament to what you can do, what one person can do, reaching out to others.
[02:15:57.585 --> 02:15:58.205]  Look what you've done!
[02:15:58.225 --> 02:16:02.267]  How many years have you been on public and you've already gotten massive attention and very effective?
[02:16:03.827 --> 02:16:07.928]  The book has been out for a year and a half and I didn't even know what I was doing.
[02:16:07.988 --> 02:16:14.770]  I just do my passion, I do what I think is right, and now I'm being attacked on O'Reilly Factor, I'm being plugged on ABC's The View.
[02:16:16.311 --> 02:16:20.312]  It's incredible what your passion can do for you and I'm sure that the Loose Change guys
[02:16:20.714 --> 02:16:22.976]  They didn't have this grand plan of what they were going to do.
[02:16:23.076 --> 02:16:24.458]  You just do what you think is right.
[02:16:24.518 --> 02:16:25.018]  Exactly.
[02:16:25.719 --> 02:16:26.700]  And you keep me safe.
[02:16:26.740 --> 02:16:27.481]  I keep you safe.
[02:16:27.521 --> 02:16:28.582]  Lou Change keeps us safe.
[02:16:28.922 --> 02:16:29.583]  More targets.
[02:16:29.623 --> 02:16:30.183]  More people.
[02:16:30.463 --> 02:16:32.185]  That's why I want other Patriot Networks.
[02:16:32.205 --> 02:16:33.226]  They don't even understand that.
[02:16:33.466 --> 02:16:34.627]  They've never understood that.
[02:16:35.348 --> 02:16:37.530]  That's why I have people from other networks on here.
[02:16:37.931 --> 02:16:39.212]  I just want to win.
[02:16:39.452 --> 02:16:40.733]  We've got to beat these people.
[02:16:40.753 --> 02:16:41.935]  They kidnap children!
[02:16:42.735 --> 02:16:44.755]  Geez, I mean, these are bad people!
[02:16:45.115 --> 02:16:59.898]  Yeah, and we need people, we need a collective intelligence agency like you have at Infowars.com, a resource like you, Alex, where we can just tune in and we can get the news so that we don't have to spend hours and hours every day researching this, sifting through this.
[02:16:59.938 --> 02:17:06.779]  We can just listen to your show for an hour or two and we can get the news, we can get the gist, we can all stay on the same page, we can keep informed.
[02:17:07.059 --> 02:17:11.220]  PrisonPlanet.com is one of the most popular websites on the internet.
[02:17:12.322 --> 02:17:16.160]  More important, more popular than like you said, most of the mainstream news sites.
[02:17:17.073 --> 02:17:30.785]  And more people are going there now to get their news, which is just fully sourced from other mainstream sources that are just bits and pieces around the country in different newspapers into one collective source so that you can see what it is that we're doing.
[02:17:30.905 --> 02:17:32.567]  Well, I appreciate that, and we all need to do it.
[02:17:32.627 --> 02:17:36.390]  More sites, more info, more war against the New World Order for Peace.
[02:17:36.610 --> 02:17:37.171]  God bless you.
[02:17:37.191 --> 02:17:38.152]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[02:17:38.252 --> 02:17:38.652]  You got it.
[02:17:39.012 --> 02:17:40.153]  Your calls are straight ahead.

[02:18:47.649 --> 02:18:48.930]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:49.290 --> 02:18:51.291]  Here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:52.492 --> 02:18:57.335]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:57.535 --> 02:19:00.277]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:19:00.317 --> 02:19:01.437]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:19:02.758 --> 02:19:07.341]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:08.277 --> 02:19:15.541]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:19:16.542 --> 02:19:19.604]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:19:19.664 --> 02:19:25.227]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[02:19:46.151 --> 02:19:48.534]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.214 --> 02:20:01.466]  Did you know that those seeking to destroy America and merge us into an all-powerful one-world government said that they support every movement to centralize all authority in Washington, D.C., and therefore bypass the state governments?
[02:20:02.373 --> 02:20:06.056]  That way they would have only one battle to win, Washington D.C.
[02:20:06.917 --> 02:20:13.062]  Have we witnessed the accumulation of power in Washington and bypassing the states over the last 50 years?

[02:20:42.501 --> 02:20:45.102]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[02:20:45.242 --> 02:20:51.404]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[02:20:51.544 --> 02:21:00.687]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.

[02:21:54.456 --> 02:21:56.517]  Riders on the storm.
[02:21:58.878 --> 02:22:03.361]  Into this house we're born.
[02:22:03.561 --> 02:22:06.803]  Into this world we're thrown.
[02:22:07.824 --> 02:22:10.225]  Like a dog without a bone.
[02:22:10.425 --> 02:22:12.426]  An actor out of role.
[02:22:13.167 --> 02:22:14.848]  Riders on the storm.
[02:22:16.753 --> 02:22:18.454]  Take a long holiday.
[02:22:18.654 --> 02:22:19.975]  I love that part.
[02:22:20.356 --> 02:22:23.718]  Take a long holiday, let your children play.
[02:22:23.958 --> 02:22:28.421]  Let's roll that part and I'll go to your calls.
[02:22:28.481 --> 02:22:31.623]  Take a long holiday.
[02:22:32.023 --> 02:22:35.626]  Let your children play.
[02:22:36.286 --> 02:22:38.828]  If you give this man a ride, sweetie.
[02:22:40.376 --> 02:22:43.877]  That's right.
[02:22:44.378 --> 02:22:46.699]  His mind is squirming like a toad.
[02:22:47.879 --> 02:22:49.280]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:49.840 --> 02:22:54.121]  Give this man a ride, sweet man.
[02:22:54.181 --> 02:22:55.322]  We will die.
[02:22:56.182 --> 02:22:57.903]  But you gave him a ride, didn't you, America?
[02:22:57.963 --> 02:22:58.943]  You bought into evil.
[02:22:58.963 --> 02:23:00.304]  You bought into a corrupt government.
[02:23:00.664 --> 02:23:01.804]  Now you gotta get out of it.
[02:23:02.085 --> 02:23:08.147]  Time for you to stop playing games, stop joking around, and realize we are in deep, deep, deep hot water.
[02:23:08.974 --> 02:23:12.997]  Let's go to Matt in North Carolina, then Peter, Ed, George, Jim and others.
[02:23:13.057 --> 02:23:13.818]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:23:14.799 --> 02:23:22.745]  Hey Alex, essentially a beautiful day here in North Carolina, but I feel like I'm swimming in an ocean full of right whales.
[02:23:24.026 --> 02:23:28.310]  I tell you, I smack them on the head with a 2x4, but they don't seem to want to wake up to the truth.
[02:23:29.128 --> 02:23:33.329]  And I'm really concerned about... Well, they're going to get hauled onto a factory ship and rendered!
[02:23:33.869 --> 02:23:38.491]  I know, and that's... I'm really... I'm super scared about this because I see it's a reality.
[02:23:38.531 --> 02:23:42.512]  I'm seeing it with some very clear lenses right now due to your program.
[02:23:42.552 --> 02:23:48.474]  And I woke up about a year and a half ago and found out about you on C-SPAN when you were in L.A.
[02:23:48.814 --> 02:23:49.334]  at the conference.
[02:23:49.374 --> 02:23:51.575]  I thought that was just so amazing to see it on C-SPAN.
[02:23:51.595 --> 02:23:52.175]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:23:52.888 --> 02:24:05.183]  Yeah, it's going to be fantastic, but I think we've still got some rough waters ahead, some tumultuous times, and I've got a question about the national ID that's coming out.
[02:24:05.243 --> 02:24:06.305]  I guess it's May of 2008.
[02:24:07.933 --> 02:24:08.774]  We're good to go.
[02:24:24.265 --> 02:24:24.765]  We're good to go.
[02:24:49.319 --> 02:24:50.259]  It's the same thing with this.
[02:24:50.299 --> 02:25:04.725]  We're already under National ID Card, which itself, in 2000, it was in major Australian papers at a big UN summit there, and Universal Standards, through the big Universal Standards Cooperative, or whatever the name of it is, that's almost it.
[02:25:04.745 --> 02:25:05.485]  You can go pull it up.
[02:25:06.325 --> 02:25:21.035]  Uh, created the World ID system, which itself had already been adopted by most Western nations and many third world nations because IMF and World Bank funds tell corporations that countries can't pay them for services unless they already have adopted off of those rules.
[02:25:21.695 --> 02:25:23.696]  So they call it standardizing transparency.
[02:25:23.737 --> 02:25:27.259]  It's actually the opposite for global imperial governance.
[02:25:28.613 --> 02:25:31.835]  So it's 2010 before they put the RFID component in?
[02:25:31.895 --> 02:25:36.439]  Yeah, but we already had a national ID card in 1993 with Clinton's executive order.
[02:25:36.459 --> 02:25:39.021]  It's in my film, America Destroyed by Design.
[02:25:39.401 --> 02:25:43.424]  Now they just announced it to you, but then because they saw resistance, then they back off.
[02:25:44.016 --> 02:25:49.799]  You see, it's like Merck a month ago said, we're suspending the HPB lobbying, we're going to stop, you're right.
[02:25:50.019 --> 02:25:52.621]  Then it turned out they're still lobbying, they just tell you.
[02:25:52.821 --> 02:25:57.603]  Okay, you see, they come to fight you, and then you know, first they come in with stealth, then you fight them.
[02:25:57.623 --> 02:25:58.744]  They go, okay, and they run off.
[02:25:58.964 --> 02:26:00.965]  And as soon as you turn, they shorty back in.
[02:26:02.547 --> 02:26:06.351]  It's like a sword fight, okay?
[02:26:06.452 --> 02:26:14.502]  As far as fighting back, I was just wondering if there is a commercial or maybe a DVD burner that we can't get a hold of at Best Buy.
[02:26:14.542 --> 02:26:18.187]  I mean, it takes me forever to burn a DVD and I don't want to put you out of business or anything.
[02:26:18.787 --> 02:26:20.068]  I've got to do something.
[02:26:20.128 --> 02:26:20.569]  What do you mean?
[02:26:20.609 --> 02:26:21.249]  I want you.
[02:26:21.409 --> 02:26:22.670]  My business is surviving.
[02:26:22.730 --> 02:26:23.671]  My business is living.
[02:26:23.951 --> 02:26:27.614]  My business is doing what's good for my soul.
[02:26:27.694 --> 02:26:29.776]  That means dying under the torturer's knife.
[02:26:34.179 --> 02:26:38.420]  We're going to be like the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany combined if we don't stop them.
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:39.480]  They're going for broke.
[02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:41.600]  They're all over TV saying we should all be arrested.
[02:26:41.780 --> 02:26:43.221]  They're all over TV saying we're traitors.
[02:26:43.361 --> 02:26:45.981]  They're all over TV saying we're butchers of the Bill of Rights.
[02:26:46.381 --> 02:26:56.603]  They introduced the Total Open Borders blanket amnesty plan today and then said, oh, this is only a temporary, temporary, total bull, end of the country right there alone.
[02:26:56.823 --> 02:27:00.664]  We have so many spears at our heart that have already been thrown, okay?
[02:27:01.244 --> 02:27:06.729]  We've got seconds in the scheme of civilizations, and that's years or months, to step out of the way of these.
[02:27:07.150 --> 02:27:09.652]  We have... Javelins have been thrown at us.
[02:27:10.475 --> 02:27:13.676]  Is there a type of commercial DVD burner we can get a hold of?
[02:27:13.696 --> 02:27:15.057]  Yeah, I don't have all the specs.
[02:27:15.097 --> 02:27:17.318]  Go to like a Fry's or something or look online.
[02:27:17.618 --> 02:27:20.379]  They have all sorts of big commercial mega DVD burners.
[02:27:20.399 --> 02:27:22.020]  A lot of mine are DVD-9s.
[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:26.082]  You want to get one that's compatible to burn a DVD-9, then you can get those.
[02:27:26.202 --> 02:27:29.083]  Or you can put it on a computer, shrink it down to a DVD-5 and burn it.
[02:27:29.404 --> 02:27:30.264]  It's easy to do.
[02:27:30.324 --> 02:27:31.244]  You can't be stopped.
[02:27:31.324 --> 02:27:32.285]  You just take action.
[02:27:32.305 --> 02:27:33.365]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.147 --> 02:27:37.047]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.527 --> 02:27:39.028]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.038 --> 02:27:42.781]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.764 --> 02:27:48.486]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?

[02:27:57.715 --> 02:27:59.998]  The average savings for generic drugs was over 71%.

[02:28:38.787 --> 02:28:39.408]  Do it today!
[02:28:45.254 --> 02:28:49.815]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:28:50.215 --> 02:28:53.156]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:28:53.476 --> 02:28:56.036]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:28:56.396 --> 02:29:01.217]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:29:01.597 --> 02:29:06.978]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:29:07.258 --> 02:29:10.239]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:29:10.419 --> 02:29:12.141]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[02:29:13.082 --> 02:29:22.130]  Many people believe that this will be the Mark of the Beast, because of the restrictive measures included, which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[02:29:22.430 --> 02:29:28.716]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the Mark of the Beast, it says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[02:29:29.056 --> 02:29:30.677]  It says, worship the beast.
[02:29:30.958 --> 02:29:33.560]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[02:29:33.820 --> 02:29:39.022]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:29:39.042 --> 02:29:39.362]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:29:39.382 --> 02:29:39.482]  Hello?
[02:29:39.502 --> 02:29:39.722]  Hey, it's me.
[02:29:39.742 --> 02:29:41.323]  I got something, man, I want you to look at.
[02:29:41.363 --> 02:29:41.683]  What?
[02:29:41.863 --> 02:29:42.363]  What is it now?
[02:29:42.463 --> 02:29:43.343]  It's called OneYearToRetire.net.
[02:29:56.772 --> 02:29:59.513]  When you get home, I want you to go to OneYearToRetire.net.
[02:29:59.593 --> 02:30:00.934]  Come on, you gotta be kidding.
[02:30:01.394 --> 02:30:02.474]  One year to retire?
[02:30:02.494 --> 02:30:05.455]  When are you gonna get it through your head that there is no quick fix?
[02:30:05.796 --> 02:30:06.496]  No free lunch?
[02:30:07.036 --> 02:30:07.296]  I know.
[02:30:07.676 --> 02:30:08.437]  I agree with you.
[02:30:08.577 --> 02:30:09.537]  This isn't like that.
[02:30:10.097 --> 02:30:13.719]  It's an ingenious system that's designed to help you retire in one year.
[02:30:13.739 --> 02:30:19.221]  I was skeptical too, but the system is free, and when I looked at it, I was sure it would work.
[02:30:19.841 --> 02:30:20.681]  What have you got to lose?
[02:30:20.741 --> 02:30:21.262]  It's free.
[02:30:21.702 --> 02:30:21.882]  Well?
[02:30:22.535 --> 02:30:26.697]  All you have to do is go to OneYearToRetire.net and get a free system.
[02:30:27.257 --> 02:30:28.257]  It only takes a minute.
[02:30:28.458 --> 02:30:30.618]  You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.
[02:30:31.279 --> 02:30:33.199]  Go to OneYearToRetire.net.
[02:30:33.700 --> 02:30:35.881]  That's OneYearToRetire.net.
[02:30:36.461 --> 02:30:36.921]  Or call 888-200-0265.
[02:30:36.981 --> 02:30:37.221]  That's 888-200-0265.
[02:31:03.977 --> 02:31:05.439]  Red, white and blue.
[02:31:05.459 --> 02:31:07.000]  People shuffling their feet.
[02:31:07.160 --> 02:31:08.602]  People sleeping in their shoes.
[02:31:08.622 --> 02:31:11.545]  There's a warning sign on the road ahead.
[02:31:11.565 --> 02:31:12.646]  There's a lot of people saying,
[02:31:41.749 --> 02:31:42.149]  We're good to go.
[02:32:13.961 --> 02:32:14.884]  I think so.
[02:32:37.165 --> 02:32:41.930]  Absolutely, that's what we're fighting.
[02:32:42.351 --> 02:32:48.998]  Narcotics is federal agents shipped in here daily.
[02:32:59.517 --> 02:33:00.478]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:33:00.558 --> 02:33:01.738]  It's been quite some time since I've phoned in.
[02:33:01.798 --> 02:33:11.563]  Anyway, you made some statements regarding local activism and that one of the last things is we have to realize how many of us there are out there and I took that seriously with a few other
[02:33:28.939 --> 02:33:30.400]  People here in the greater St.
[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:37.485]  Louis area, and it's absolutely amazing what a small handful of dedicated activists can do.
[02:33:38.245 --> 02:33:40.687]  We have a 9-11 meetup group going.
[02:33:40.707 --> 02:33:44.350]  I started an Alex Jones meetup group.
[02:33:44.370 --> 02:33:50.234]  All you gotta do is search on the meetup.com site, and it's strictly for local activism.
[02:33:50.974 --> 02:33:56.738]  And we have a big event planned on April 16th, which I call the Day of Infamy.
[02:33:56.798 --> 02:33:57.559]  It's Tax Day.
[02:33:58.348 --> 02:34:04.473]  And there's about 15 of us so far that are going to be showing up in tyranny response team shirts.
[02:34:05.233 --> 02:34:05.634]  Awesome!
[02:34:05.654 --> 02:34:07.875]  In fact, speaking of that, in a few minutes it will take some more calls.
[02:34:07.955 --> 02:34:11.438]  I'm going to play a short clip of 9-11 Truthers in action in Philly.
[02:34:15.541 --> 02:34:15.861]  Are you there?
[02:34:16.262 --> 02:34:16.482]  Yes.
[02:34:17.362 --> 02:34:18.283]  Go ahead, I was just adding that.
[02:34:18.623 --> 02:34:19.104]  Oh, okay.
[02:34:19.144 --> 02:34:19.444]  Alright.
[02:34:20.164 --> 02:34:25.468]  Well, anyway, I'm encouraging people all around the country to show up in front of the post office.
[02:34:26.764 --> 02:34:37.893]  On April 16th, as I said, we'll be out there in the all-black outfits with the response team shirts, which is to create a public perception.
[02:34:38.654 --> 02:34:41.496]  And at the same time, we're going to be out there with your videos.
[02:34:41.516 --> 02:34:44.258]  We're going to be out there with Aaron Russo's videos.
[02:34:45.259 --> 02:34:50.343]  Our group, we just purchased a 14-stack of duplicators.
[02:34:50.363 --> 02:34:52.465]  We're going to have some duplicating parties.
[02:34:52.915 --> 02:34:55.397]  For Tara Storm and Aaron Russo's video.
[02:34:55.757 --> 02:34:57.639]  I love it!
[02:34:57.839 --> 02:35:02.102]  And let me tell you, that medicine for this republic spells cyanide in the New World Order.
[02:35:02.743 --> 02:35:09.188]  Okay, but the thing is, this is all about linking up locally, and I'm just urging other people to do the same.
[02:35:09.208 --> 02:35:16.194]  I just have one other comment and question that is regarding this global warming nonsense.
[02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:26.443]  I think that the whole plan is to shift the monetary system into monetizing carbon credits as opposed to units of debt.
[02:35:26.803 --> 02:35:28.143]  No, no, that's exactly what it is.
[02:35:28.183 --> 02:35:37.026]  That way they can fool people to think that there's international debt to an international power and it's a unifying field to, oh, we must mobilize to save the earth.
[02:35:37.046 --> 02:35:38.386]  That's what Al Gore said yesterday.
[02:35:38.946 --> 02:35:41.288]  Yeah, that's been one of their other little plans.
[02:35:54.271 --> 02:35:55.373]  I don't think so.
[02:36:10.330 --> 02:36:21.074]  Are those morons with the so-called fair tax, which you and I know, and a lot of other people have figured out, is going to be an excuse to... Yeah, they're going to keep the income tax and rename it.
[02:36:21.094 --> 02:36:28.197]  It'll be your Social Security tax at 10%, quote, frozen, with a new 25% sales tax, with federal regulators at every level.
[02:36:28.377 --> 02:36:28.978]  We've got to jump.
[02:36:29.018 --> 02:36:29.678]  Tell folks the date.
[02:36:30.721 --> 02:36:32.622]  April 16th day event for me.
[02:36:32.682 --> 02:36:34.383]  It's Monday evening 7 p.m.
[02:36:34.403 --> 02:36:36.525]  in front of your local post office.
[02:36:36.565 --> 02:36:38.826]  We'll be having a big celebration.
[02:36:38.846 --> 02:36:41.127]  And it doesn't matter if it's one person, folks.
[02:36:41.167 --> 02:36:42.808]  That's how revolutions start.
[02:36:43.008 --> 02:36:43.569]  God bless you.
[02:36:43.589 --> 02:36:44.169]  Thanks for the call.
[02:36:45.191 --> 02:36:48.732]  Of course, they probably have 50 people, 100 people out there, but the point is, you start with one.
[02:36:48.772 --> 02:36:49.552]  You bring your neighbor.
[02:36:49.612 --> 02:36:51.152]  It starts with that leadership.
[02:36:51.713 --> 02:36:54.313]  It starts with simply stepping up and taking action.
[02:36:54.913 --> 02:37:00.575]  That's exactly what I did many years ago, and I'm telling you, my job is to get you to realize you can do that.
[02:37:01.335 --> 02:37:03.515]  I'm not here to be the Grand Poobah, as I've always said.
[02:37:04.196 --> 02:37:14.618]  I'm here to get more people activated and motivated to have the basic Bill of Rights culture in their heart and soul, in their mind, and then to move forward aggressively against the global crime syndicate.
[02:37:15.891 --> 02:37:17.572]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ed.
[02:37:17.592 --> 02:37:20.174]  And Ed, where are you calling us from?
[02:37:20.874 --> 02:37:21.895]  Apollo PA, Alex.
[02:37:22.055 --> 02:37:22.375]  Welcome.
[02:37:23.316 --> 02:37:26.518]  Three quick things for your crew.
[02:37:26.998 --> 02:37:30.120]  Pink Floyd has a song called Dogs of War on YouTube.
[02:37:30.561 --> 02:37:31.441]  Yeah, good song.
[02:37:33.282 --> 02:37:37.005]  For the listeners out there, type in shampoo and dangers and they'll
[02:37:37.523 --> 02:37:40.586]  We go to major university studies on how toxic shampoos are.
[02:37:40.666 --> 02:37:50.794]  That's why most kids, mixed with all the other toxic stuff in the environment, it's admitted that many of those chemicals are what are causing the autoimmune response, the allergic response of asthma.
[02:37:52.075 --> 02:37:56.979]  The third thing is we have a neocon show around here that covers western PA and eastern Ohio.
[02:37:57.480 --> 02:38:02.464]  And yesterday morning the guy was screaming on how we should nuke all the Muslims, kill them all.
[02:38:03.084 --> 02:38:05.987]  And his sidekick, she's a female, she was hollering,
[02:38:06.624 --> 02:38:09.446]  Rosie O'Donnell's a big, fat, ugly dyke.
[02:38:09.686 --> 02:38:11.306]  She hollered it five times in a row.
[02:38:11.767 --> 02:38:13.608]  She just shut up her mouth about terrorism.
[02:38:13.648 --> 02:38:14.288]  She kept hollering.
[02:38:14.668 --> 02:38:16.529]  I just couldn't believe what my ears were hearing and stuff.
[02:38:16.949 --> 02:38:17.730]  It's not going to work.
[02:38:17.790 --> 02:38:18.730]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:19.171 --> 02:38:22.953]  By the way, I have a big clip here, and I didn't have time to play it yesterday, and I don't have time today.
[02:38:23.873 --> 02:38:27.615]  But they've got World Can't Wait Lady, who we've interviewed, very well spoken.
[02:38:28.455 --> 02:38:29.736]  People go, but she's a liberal.
[02:38:29.836 --> 02:38:30.997]  It doesn't matter, okay?
[02:38:31.077 --> 02:38:32.818]  The point is, she's on there telling the truth.
[02:38:33.658 --> 02:38:34.959]  And she's on the show,
[02:38:36.424 --> 02:38:37.845]  I ought to just play it this long.
[02:38:38.905 --> 02:38:41.386]  And she says they lied about WMDs.
[02:38:41.406 --> 02:38:42.106]  He goes, no they didn't.
[02:38:42.126 --> 02:38:42.986]  And she goes through all these things.
[02:38:43.006 --> 02:38:46.107]  And then he goes, he goes, okay, you say they tortured.
[02:38:46.148 --> 02:38:50.009]  She goes, yes, they've, they've written memos that they can torture children with pliers.
[02:38:50.669 --> 02:38:51.329]  I hate to repeat it.
[02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:52.270]  You know, you know what they said.
[02:38:52.810 --> 02:38:54.250]  And Roddy goes, name the child.
[02:38:54.290 --> 02:38:54.891]  You're lying.
[02:38:54.911 --> 02:38:55.371]  You're lying.
[02:38:55.411 --> 02:38:56.031]  Name the child.
[02:38:56.091 --> 02:38:56.771]  Name who was tortured.
[02:38:56.791 --> 02:38:58.152]  And she said, it's in a memo.
[02:38:58.172 --> 02:38:59.072]  They said they could do it.
[02:38:59.625 --> 02:39:06.471]  And he goes, you're a liar, you're a liar, and he kicks her off the show, and then next he gets another lady on and goes, how dare her claim the government tortures children with no proof!
[02:39:07.932 --> 02:39:15.379]  I mean, and there's all these people who want to sit there at home and feel like everything's okay, and Fox News is there to tell them that.
[02:39:15.719 --> 02:39:21.804]  Everything's okay as long as you worship the government, and as long as you do this and that, everything's going to be alright.
[02:39:21.865 --> 02:39:23.026]  I mean, it's disgusting!
[02:39:24.006 --> 02:39:25.588]  It's totally and completely
[02:39:26.581 --> 02:39:28.422]  And they're going to flip it back over to liberal now.
[02:39:28.462 --> 02:39:32.324]  They say Fox is about to go liberal, and Hillary's our leader.
[02:39:32.724 --> 02:39:33.485]  I mean, it should.
[02:39:33.525 --> 02:39:36.306]  And then suddenly the left will be like, don't talk about how we love Fox.
[02:39:37.047 --> 02:39:38.707]  I mean, this is so sick!
[02:39:39.968 --> 02:39:44.250]  They're elitist, period, anti-American, corrupt individuals.
[02:39:44.350 --> 02:39:49.193]  And, I mean, John Yu, Alberto Gonzales, wrote these memos.
[02:39:49.533 --> 02:39:51.354]  It's been in the news that they've ordered the torture.
[02:39:52.715 --> 02:39:53.415]  It's admitted!
[02:39:54.286 --> 02:39:56.607]  And O'Reilly's up there saying it isn't true!
[02:39:57.347 --> 02:39:58.887]  Steve Watson wrote a great article about that.
[02:39:58.907 --> 02:39:59.988]  You ought to get me out to the folks.
[02:40:01.348 --> 02:40:04.489]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in, uh, recall him, George.
[02:40:04.769 --> 02:40:05.269]  Indiana.
[02:40:05.429 --> 02:40:05.910]  Welcome, sir.
[02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.630]  Thank you.
[02:40:06.650 --> 02:40:08.210]  Uh, Alex, a couple of things.
[02:40:08.250 --> 02:40:10.691]  Now, I know, uh, you're on the Internet a lot.
[02:40:10.711 --> 02:40:13.372]  You've seen this idiot that talks about Iron Burns.
[02:40:14.404 --> 02:40:16.828]  Uh, in fact he talks about you all the way through it.
[02:40:29.947 --> 02:40:35.269]  And they know you've got a public that can't tell you how many continents there are, that don't know the continent they're on.
[02:40:35.289 --> 02:40:44.032]  And I always use that example, because I've seen major studies, who don't know who the Vice President is, who don't know where Persia is, who don't know where, you know, Alexandria is.
[02:40:44.052 --> 02:40:47.854]  I mean, they don't know which way the Nile flows.
[02:40:48.034 --> 02:40:48.534]  Most people don't.
[02:40:48.554 --> 02:40:50.155]  But the point is, they know nothing!
[02:40:50.595 --> 02:40:51.015]  Nothing!
[02:40:51.395 --> 02:40:51.815]  Nothing!
[02:40:52.055 --> 02:40:58.738]  And so they can just sit there and say, why, iron and steel burn like, you know, and buildings fall down all the time.
[02:40:59.458 --> 02:41:03.244]  It's unbelievable.
[02:41:04.145 --> 02:41:09.894]  One thing I wanted to mention though, Alex, nobody has done this, and I'm a very visual type person.
[02:41:10.635 --> 02:41:18.197]  I would like to see somebody take a piece of the beam, or a beam the same size and a wheelbarrow, and wheel it out.
[02:41:18.257 --> 02:41:28.121]  Now that professor at Utah showed up that little tiny piece of thing, if you remember that little piece of metal that he said he got thermate out of, or thermite out of.
[02:41:28.481 --> 02:41:30.001]  You need a bigger visual.
[02:41:30.061 --> 02:41:34.543]  People don't realize how big those center beams were that was holding that building up.
[02:41:34.603 --> 02:41:35.343]  Four foot around.
[02:41:35.663 --> 02:41:38.224]  Yeah, but nobody can realize it.
[02:41:38.544 --> 02:41:46.867]  When you look on the video and you watch this building fall, it falls like a cardboard box and no one has the visual of exactly how big those beams are.
[02:41:47.287 --> 02:41:50.848]  You could sit there all day with a blowtorch and you couldn't hear it.
[02:41:50.928 --> 02:41:58.291]  Listen, you could take those four foot around beams and you could literally stick them in a huge lake of gasoline.
[02:41:59.309 --> 02:42:02.511]  And you could light the gasoline that burns a lot hotter than kerosene.
[02:42:02.531 --> 02:42:03.452]  That's what jet fuel is.
[02:42:03.952 --> 02:42:06.874]  People have this mistaken idea that jet fuel is like rocket fuel.
[02:42:07.294 --> 02:42:08.095]  Solid rocket fuel.
[02:42:08.135 --> 02:42:08.395]  No, no, no.
[02:42:08.435 --> 02:42:10.977]  It burns lower because you don't want it to be explosive.
[02:42:11.317 --> 02:42:12.518]  Gasoline burns pretty hot.
[02:42:12.538 --> 02:42:16.561]  It's like the iron that melts a lot easier than structural steel.
[02:42:16.601 --> 02:42:18.442]  You could have your white hot coals at 1800 degrees.
[02:42:28.852 --> 02:42:35.594]  2,000 degrees for months in a continual big wood fire, and none of that iron melts or weakens or bends?
[02:42:35.934 --> 02:42:40.136]  No, we've got a 20-year-old girder in our fireplace, and it still does its fine.
[02:42:40.216 --> 02:42:42.376]  It doesn't lose its strength.
[02:42:42.796 --> 02:42:43.837]  But steel burns, as you said.
[02:42:43.877 --> 02:42:44.337]  I've seen that.
[02:42:44.597 --> 02:42:45.397]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[02:42:45.817 --> 02:42:49.799]  Yeah, next they're going to claim that the sun is cold or something.
[02:42:49.859 --> 02:42:51.579]  I mean, look, let them, folks.
[02:42:51.759 --> 02:42:57.621]  What's happened is the general public that they can dumb down was never involved in politics anyways.
[02:42:58.385 --> 02:42:59.986]  I don't know how to explain that to people.
[02:43:00.006 --> 02:43:00.867]  It's the thinking people.
[02:43:19.312 --> 02:43:19.692]  All right?
[02:43:19.932 --> 02:43:20.752]  It was the same thing in 1776.
[02:43:21.053 --> 02:43:25.174]  You're going to have the thinkers on their side and the thinkers on our side.
[02:43:25.414 --> 02:43:27.735]  Thinkers on their side go, the public's dumbed down.
[02:43:28.315 --> 02:43:31.696]  I'm going to try to dumb them down even further to make them more manageable so I can rob them.
[02:43:32.796 --> 02:43:34.137]  Can you imagine living like that?
[02:43:34.177 --> 02:43:37.558]  Like you're smart, but you use your smarts to con people?
[02:43:39.798 --> 02:43:41.819]  I guess that's second nature to a lot of folks.
[02:43:42.819 --> 02:43:44.680]  Okay, let me play this and we'll come back and take some final calls.
[02:43:44.700 --> 02:43:47.681]  9-11 truthers confront Alan Mingledershowitz.
[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:54.960]  Brainwashed, raptured, stoned, fake Christians in an Israeli vs. screaming booth throw their toys out of the
[02:43:56.027 --> 02:43:56.527]  Playpen.
[02:43:57.288 --> 02:44:20.220]  Activists from 9-11, Philly 9-11 Truth Organization confronted arch neocon and torture advocate Alan Mingala Dershowitz at a speaking event last week, causing his fake Christian Israeli first vulture audience to boo and throw their toys out of the playpen shortly before security were called to drag the dissenters out of the building for the crime of asking a question.
[02:44:20.780 --> 02:44:29.046]  Dershowitz was top of the bill for the Kool-Aid drinkers who attended the Global Terrorism, the New World War event at the University of Pennsylvania.
[02:44:29.506 --> 02:44:45.877]  The video begins with Dershowitz pimping for more wars for Israel to which a brainwashed woman most probably introduced and terrified by the phenomenon of the menace of the llama fascism slavishly repeats the word Amen like she's at a Heaven's Gate cult seminar.
[02:44:46.417 --> 02:44:47.978]  So let's go ahead and play the clip.
[02:44:48.078 --> 02:44:48.919]  It's 9-11 Truthers.
[02:44:49.159 --> 02:44:50.160]  Hit them and hit them hard!
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:45:01.707]  But I don't think you fight a war, even in response, unless you have a clear endgame in mind and are very confident that you can win decisively.
[02:45:02.027 --> 02:45:09.492]  Israel can never go into a battle unless it can win decisively and categorically.
[02:45:11.133 --> 02:45:13.496]  We're good to go.
[02:45:13.536 --> 02:45:14.637]  We're good to go.
[02:45:32.134 --> 02:45:44.237]  And the Gulf of Tonkin incident, both having emerged as classic false flag operations, never happened, were entirely carried out by the respective elements or governments within.
[02:45:44.877 --> 02:45:54.319]  Then looking at 9-11, it really emerges as another classic false flag operation where elements within the government actually carry out the attack.
[02:45:55.399 --> 02:45:58.101]  Just look at the evidence.
[02:45:58.642 --> 02:46:01.004]  The head of the Visa Bureau.
[02:46:01.024 --> 02:46:02.005]  This is normal.
[02:46:02.065 --> 02:46:04.467]  The head of the Visa Bureau in Genesis.
[02:46:04.507 --> 02:46:05.267]  This is normal.
[02:46:05.327 --> 02:46:06.468]  Get out!
[02:46:06.508 --> 02:46:07.049]  Get out!
[02:46:07.149 --> 02:46:11.152]  Go on YouTube and watch how we do things.
[02:46:27.960 --> 02:46:30.282]  When do you go to the next show?
[02:46:30.482 --> 02:46:31.182]  Early afternoon.
[02:46:31.242 --> 02:46:31.723]  Well thank you.
[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:45.421]  You got your buddy on YouTube?
[02:46:45.481 --> 02:46:47.322]  Oh yeah, I got it.
[02:46:47.362 --> 02:46:47.862]  It's pretty good.
[02:46:48.342 --> 02:46:52.684]  I still feel proud of it actually, but you can do that if you want to do that.
[02:47:12.652 --> 02:47:15.913]  I'll answer your question.
[02:47:16.073 --> 02:47:23.916]  Two or three of the people on the 9-11 Commission are my students and my friends, are people who I trust completely.
[02:47:24.556 --> 02:47:30.138]  The 9-11 Commission came to the right conclusion based on all the evidence.
[02:47:30.758 --> 02:47:34.766]  Clearly, he goes on and says it's the 19 hijackers.
[02:47:35.147 --> 02:47:40.056]  Alan Dershowitz has said that we should have torture warrants and torture people, and that we shouldn't have a bill of rights.
[02:47:40.236 --> 02:47:41.919]  This is the liberal lawyer.
[02:47:44.241 --> 02:47:47.023]  And you've got this giant brainwashed cult of people in there.
[02:47:47.043 --> 02:47:50.085]  And these are people coming up to have questions asked.
[02:47:50.465 --> 02:47:55.768]  And just screaming and yelling and things being thrown at them.
[02:47:55.848 --> 02:47:56.969]  And Dershowitz, go!
[02:47:57.429 --> 02:47:59.510]  Go to YouTube and watch your Howdy Doody.
[02:47:59.570 --> 02:48:00.611]  Hey, that's the future.
[02:48:01.572 --> 02:48:08.076]  Individual media, you don't have a monopoly anymore to say the horrible things you say, you dirtbag, who thinks people should be tortured.
[02:48:08.096 --> 02:48:08.596]  And they were.
[02:48:08.616 --> 02:48:11.598]  And you're an accessory to that for giving them moral support.
[02:48:11.618 --> 02:48:13.159]  Do you understand?
[02:48:14.306 --> 02:48:19.113]  That we have the majority of the people, and we're not afraid to die, and we're gonna expose you.
[02:48:20.455 --> 02:48:21.877]  You understand that, Dershowitz?
[02:48:22.338 --> 02:48:23.540]  You understand that, all of you?
[02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:24.762]  We're not gonna stop.
[02:48:24.782 --> 02:48:25.563]  Do you understand?
[02:48:25.763 --> 02:48:27.125]  We're never going to stop.
[02:48:27.326 --> 02:48:28.788]  And you know it, don't you?
[02:48:29.580 --> 02:48:30.661]  And now you're scared.
[02:48:30.681 --> 02:48:32.463]  You're not as arrogant as you once were.
[02:48:32.483 --> 02:48:34.406]  I don't like the fact you're scared.
[02:48:34.426 --> 02:48:35.987]  It makes you a little bit harder enemy to beat.
[02:48:36.228 --> 02:48:37.349]  But you'll be beaten.
[02:48:37.809 --> 02:48:39.852]  But now you know you're gonna be beaten.
[02:48:40.312 --> 02:48:44.277]  So get ready for us to run over the top of ya, trash!
[02:48:48.667 --> 02:48:54.133]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.494 --> 02:49:02.142]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.822 --> 02:49:09.885]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.285 --> 02:49:21.690]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.010 --> 02:49:25.692]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.972 --> 02:49:27.913]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.233 --> 02:49:32.095]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:54.371 --> 02:51:58.532]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[02:51:58.732 --> 02:52:00.533]  Welcome back, final segment.

[02:52:11.976 --> 02:52:13.097]  This gets into modern times.
[02:52:13.157 --> 02:52:15.337]  It just looks at occultic architecture everywhere.
[02:52:15.717 --> 02:52:17.218]  And this film is freaking people out.

[02:53:18.555 --> 02:53:19.075]  Jim, go ahead.
[02:53:19.095 --> 02:53:20.375]  Hey, Mr.
[02:53:20.435 --> 02:53:21.856]  A.J., good to talk with you.
[02:53:21.996 --> 02:53:29.757]  I wanted to get your take, if you haven't covered, because I just tuned in, for the Ban Ki-moon incident.
[02:53:30.557 --> 02:53:33.778]  I'm not aware of that.
[02:53:34.078 --> 02:53:34.738]  Not aware of that.
[02:53:34.758 --> 02:53:34.938]  Okay.
[02:53:35.558 --> 02:53:36.118]  Okay.
[02:53:36.138 --> 02:53:36.739]  Say it again.
[02:53:36.959 --> 02:53:37.499]  Say it again.
[02:53:37.959 --> 02:53:43.500]  Ban Ki-moon up in, I guess he was taking a little tour in Iraq or somewhere.
[02:53:44.130 --> 02:53:47.471]  Where a, uh, a bombhead went off during a presentation.
[02:53:47.491 --> 02:53:49.512]  They had it televised on CNN.
[02:53:50.233 --> 02:53:54.674]  And, uh... Oh, you're talking about the new head of the United Nations.
[02:53:55.435 --> 02:53:56.135]  Right, right.
[02:53:56.175 --> 02:53:58.136]  Yeah, while he was giving a speech, a bomb went off.
[02:53:58.156 --> 02:53:58.856]  Sure, I saw that.
[02:53:58.956 --> 02:53:59.597]  In the green zone.
[02:53:59.617 --> 02:53:59.837]  Okay.
[02:54:00.497 --> 02:54:04.379]  I wasn't sure if you were able to cover that there in your broadcast, if you could touch on it lightly.
[02:54:05.099 --> 02:54:07.120]  And then I had a little small comment afterwards.
[02:54:07.140 --> 02:54:07.720]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:54:09.441 --> 02:54:12.322]  Okay, my comment after that was pertaining to, um...
[02:54:13.653 --> 02:54:14.574]  Oh, shoot, I forgot.
[02:54:14.734 --> 02:54:16.214]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:54:16.254 --> 02:54:17.715]  Good to hear from you there.
[02:54:18.375 --> 02:54:20.476]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in California.
[02:54:20.496 --> 02:54:20.976]  You're on the air.
[02:54:21.016 --> 02:54:21.357]  Go ahead.
[02:54:21.377 --> 02:54:27.820]  Hey, I was going to call in yesterday and ask about a particular celebrity who I'd personally like to see speak out on 9-11.
[02:54:27.900 --> 02:54:30.361]  And I didn't get the call in, but I heard you mention his name.
[02:54:30.421 --> 02:54:34.463]  I've been listening for a long time, and I've never heard you mention his name before, so I thought it was kind of odd.
[02:54:34.543 --> 02:54:35.023]  Who's that?
[02:54:35.423 --> 02:54:36.103]  Woody Harrelson.
[02:54:39.085 --> 02:54:41.586]  Yeah, I bet Woody Harrelson knows a few things.
[02:54:42.455 --> 02:54:42.815]  How come?
[02:54:43.115 --> 02:54:43.415]  How come?
[02:54:43.695 --> 02:54:44.816]  I mean, I've seen him protest.
[02:54:44.956 --> 02:54:46.416]  You know, I live up in Northern California.
[02:54:46.896 --> 02:54:49.236]  And I'm originally from Philly, by the way, so I'd like to say I'm proud of that.
[02:54:49.256 --> 02:54:52.777]  Well, because it's a big, dangerous thing to go public about, and I'm not saying he's public on that.
[02:54:54.938 --> 02:54:55.178]  Okay.
[02:54:55.598 --> 02:54:55.858]  Okay.
[02:54:56.518 --> 02:54:57.498]  Well, that's all I wanted to say.
[02:54:57.518 --> 02:55:00.159]  I talked about Woody Harrelson yesterday, because his dad died in prison.
[02:55:01.699 --> 02:55:01.799]  Oh.
[02:55:02.539 --> 02:55:03.759]  I didn't catch that part.
[02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:06.380]  Yeah, for assassinating a federal judge.
[02:55:09.701 --> 02:55:10.781]  Anything else on your mind, Tom?
[02:55:11.716 --> 02:55:12.397]  No, that was it.
[02:55:12.437 --> 02:55:17.780]  I was just wondering how come we haven't heard from Woody speak out on 9-11, and when's Neil Young going to be on the show?
[02:55:18.941 --> 02:55:21.123]  Well, we've tried that, because they're all scared, my friend.
[02:55:21.563 --> 02:55:22.784]  Bill in Kansas City.
[02:55:22.844 --> 02:55:23.544]  Bill, go ahead.
[02:55:23.564 --> 02:55:24.885]  Hi, Alex.
[02:55:24.905 --> 02:55:25.646]  How are you doing?
[02:55:25.786 --> 02:55:26.186]  Good, sir.
[02:55:26.887 --> 02:55:34.132]  I was the founder of 9-11 Visibility, and we actually met a couple of times at Crawford, Texas, and also at Ground Zero.
[02:55:35.022 --> 02:55:38.184]  We're the ones that distributed all those exposed 9-11 cover-up signs.
[02:55:38.584 --> 02:55:39.065]  Yes.
[02:55:39.765 --> 02:55:53.473]  One thing I wanted to tell your listeners is that when they see like the article, like the hit piece on page 6 in the New York paper today, they should call those papers and complain about these hit pieces.
[02:55:53.513 --> 02:55:56.815]  And I have the phone number of the New York Post.
[02:55:56.835 --> 02:55:57.635]  Sure, give it to us.
[02:55:57.775 --> 02:55:57.975]  It's 212-930-9111.
[02:56:01.647 --> 02:56:02.007]  8-5-0-0.
[02:56:02.167 --> 02:56:04.649]  Folks should call it.
[02:56:04.889 --> 02:56:07.331]  Hey, aren't you in martial law holding up the big sign in New York?
[02:56:08.132 --> 02:56:08.312]  Yeah.
[02:56:08.452 --> 02:56:11.234]  Yeah, that was the 9-11 truth sign.
[02:56:11.514 --> 02:56:12.435]  Yeah, you're in martial law.
[02:56:12.455 --> 02:56:12.655]  I know.
[02:56:12.695 --> 02:56:13.676]  You've got blonde red hair.
[02:56:13.696 --> 02:56:13.776]  Yeah.
[02:56:14.276 --> 02:56:15.577]  Yeah, it's kind of blondish.
[02:56:15.697 --> 02:56:16.118]  Yeah, right.
[02:56:16.158 --> 02:56:16.718]  We've met.
[02:56:17.038 --> 02:56:17.479]  Yeah, sure.
[02:56:17.579 --> 02:56:18.779]  I also recognize your voice.
[02:56:18.799 --> 02:56:19.400]  All right.
[02:56:19.420 --> 02:56:19.940]  God bless you.
[02:56:19.980 --> 02:56:20.561]  Have a great one.
[02:56:20.621 --> 02:56:21.321]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:56:21.361 --> 02:56:22.222]  We'll get that number out again.
