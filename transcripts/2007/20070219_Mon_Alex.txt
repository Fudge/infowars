[00:00:05.392 --> 00:00:06.033]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.693 --> 00:00:07.773]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.473 --> 00:00:09.613]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.234 --> 00:00:11.034]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:12.634]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.374 --> 00:00:17.275]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:21.616]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.221]  Welcome.
[00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:39.263]  It is Monday, the 15th day of February 2007.
[00:00:39.303 --> 00:00:43.145]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:53.970]  In the first hour and a half, we're going to cover all the different news developing across the planet and here domestically in the United States on a host of vital issues.
[00:00:54.111 --> 00:01:00.354]  And then we're going to have Dylan Avery, who's becoming quite a frequent guest, to give us his take on the unbelievably
[00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:08.024]  Shoddy 9-11 Truth Movement hit piece put out by the BBC that aired yesterday.
[00:01:09.505 --> 00:01:11.345]  We'll also be playing some clips of that.
[00:01:11.785 --> 00:01:18.548]  And then in the third hour we have the producer, the director of the program himself, who is scheduled.
[00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:20.689]  We appreciate him coming on.
[00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.430]  I gave the guy like a week of my time so he
[00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:26.237]  I'm glad he's giving us an hour of his precious time.
[00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:34.420]  We'll be joining us coming up in the third hour today, Guy Smith from the BBC.
[00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:43.584]  And we're not just covering this because it's about us or the 9-11 Tribune, we're covering it because it's an example of propaganda, it's an example of twisting.
[00:01:44.384 --> 00:01:46.305]  This thing was literally off the charts.
[00:01:46.465 --> 00:01:52.568]  Paul Watson will also be popping in from England to analyze some of the
[00:01:54.562 --> 00:02:00.323]  problems with the BBC piece while Guy Smith is on with us, but I want to give him fair time.
[00:02:01.123 --> 00:02:11.745]  Unlike his piece, they had 11 different debunkers on, and only three 9-11 truthers, Jim Fetzer, Dylan Avery, and yours truly, Alejandro Jones.
[00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:19.727]  It wasn't up until this morning on Google Video, and by the time I learned it was up, I was able to
[00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:30.844]  I watched the whole thing, but I was busy printing stories, answering the telephone, so I... I've got to watch it slowly to write notes.
[00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:37.610]  It was just... so much twisting, so much disinfo, so much misrepresentation.
[00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:39.392]  It made my head spin.
[00:02:39.732 --> 00:02:48.159]  There is an 11-page article, 11-page article, up on PrisonPlanet.com by Paul Watson,
[00:02:50.908 --> 00:03:17.920]  I would have the headline, BBC hit piece explodes in enemy's face, or BBC hit piece backfires, but Paul's got BBC hit piece, a tissue of lies, bias, and emotional manipulation, outraged, truth community demands answers from Guy Smith, immediate reactions and apologies urged, savage agenda-driven yellow journalism, an insult to the truth.
[00:03:19.082 --> 00:03:21.384]  Pretty darn strong sub-headline.
[00:03:22.084 --> 00:03:28.429]  I hope Guy, after I'm sure he admits he tracks the site almost daily, hope he's reading this, hope he still comes on.
[00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:34.294]  In fact, Kevin, call him and double-check, because you confirmed Friday afternoon he would be on.
[00:03:35.186 --> 00:03:37.408]  I talked to Guy Friday, he said it wasn't a hit piece.
[00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:39.210]  Oh no, I promise it's balanced.
[00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.894]  Though I have an email from him saying, oh I don't agree with you, I don't believe it, and you'll see the piece.
[00:03:43.974 --> 00:03:50.180]  And after we concluded our interviews back in August for that week off and on interviews, he started laughing at me.
[00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:55.505]  And I think the biggest smoking gun here is that he wouldn't let me bring up Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:03:56.226 --> 00:03:57.427]  He wouldn't let me bring up 9-11.
[00:03:59.508 --> 00:04:00.249]  Prior knowledge.
[00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.211]  He wouldn't let me bring up U.S.
[00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:04.574]  troops massed in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
[00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:12.184]  He wouldn't let me bring up the Northwoods document, which did pertain to this.
[00:04:12.945 --> 00:04:14.947]  ABC News headline, U.S.
[00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:16.689]  government plan to terrorize U.S.
[00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.513]  cities as pretext for war with Cuba.
[00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:23.210]  Baltimore Sun, similar headline.
[00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.430]  We have the actual declassified document.
[00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.791]  Didn't want to discuss that.
[00:04:28.171 --> 00:04:33.912]  And that's why they interviewed me for a week off and on and followed me to Dallas, you name it.
[00:04:35.493 --> 00:04:37.953]  And I was in the film about three minutes.
[00:04:40.594 --> 00:04:41.014]  Oh yeah!
[00:04:42.334 --> 00:04:45.155]  Because I wouldn't give them what they wanted.
[00:04:47.856 --> 00:04:48.556]  There was one
[00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:55.131]  Point in the interview, the last interview I did, well I'll tell you about it when we get back and then we'll get into all the news.
[00:04:55.551 --> 00:04:56.591]  I'm Alex Jones, stay with me.
[00:04:56.611 --> 00:05:09.635]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.015 --> 00:05:17.637]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:25.395]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.795 --> 00:05:37.221]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:41.143]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.484 --> 00:05:43.425]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.765 --> 00:05:47.607]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:01.912]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.053 --> 00:06:02.813]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.913 --> 00:06:08.976]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:10.837]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:11.077 --> 00:06:13.558]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:26.165]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases,
[00:06:26.485 --> 00:06:28.507]  And it's worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.527 --> 00:06:28.867]  government.
[00:06:29.027 --> 00:06:30.869]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:37.133]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:37.273 --> 00:06:41.697]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:17.379]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.062]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[00:08:05.626 --> 00:08:06.287]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.947 --> 00:08:07.988]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.708 --> 00:08:09.849]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.310]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:12.932]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.612 --> 00:08:17.595]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.795 --> 00:08:21.918]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.423 --> 00:08:31.566]  I just watched an audio clip of Glenn Beck last Friday.
[00:08:32.772 --> 00:08:37.135]  Spill his guts about the New World Order and shadow government.
[00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:43.058]  But it's not what it seems from the neocon in sheep's clothing.
[00:08:45.299 --> 00:08:49.702]  Of course, he can totally convert to the truth if he'd like and repent of being an operative, but I...
[00:08:50.814 --> 00:08:51.835]  Just wait until you hear the clip.
[00:08:51.855 --> 00:08:52.715]  It's very sneaky.
[00:08:52.735 --> 00:08:54.036]  That's coming up later in the shower.
[00:08:54.436 --> 00:09:04.021]  We're going to play, to analyze them, a couple of BBC News clips from the unbelievable hit piece that I just had a chance to see via Google Video this morning.
[00:09:04.041 --> 00:09:16.008]  Dylan Avery, Paul Watson will be responding, and we have the producer, the director, the Cheshire Cat himself, Guy Smith, joining us from BBC headquarters.
[00:09:16.128 --> 00:09:17.529]  We just talked to him during the break.
[00:09:17.969 --> 00:09:19.890]  He will be on in the third hour.
[00:09:20.703 --> 00:09:27.645]  With us, and I will see if he can contain himself from snickering and giggling, which seems to be his trademark when I had a chance to spend a week with him.
[00:09:29.466 --> 00:09:45.471]  And we are declaring war on Hearst Publishing, the BBC, and all other organs of clear, classical, yellow journalism, and we're going to decipher every micron of their propaganda in the next week to come, because this is important,
[00:09:46.701 --> 00:09:51.864]  Again, excellent piece by Paul Watson, BBC hit piece, A Tissue of Lies, Bias and Emotional Manipulation.
[00:09:51.884 --> 00:09:57.287]  This is the most lengthy article yet, and there are already hundreds of people are hopping mad about this.
[00:09:57.307 --> 00:10:01.150]  I mean, every 9-11 truth site out there is doing their own analysis.
[00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.730]  It's excellent.
[00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.131]  Paul has got an 11-pager.
[00:10:04.151 --> 00:10:10.175]  An 11-pager he wrote over last night into this morning from England.
[00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:15.188]  And you need to go read it for yourself and dig it.
[00:10:15.828 --> 00:10:19.211]  That is, go post it on the dig site, get it out to everybody out there.
[00:10:19.271 --> 00:10:23.535]  We have got to stand up against this affront to the truth.
[00:10:23.935 --> 00:10:26.958]  We have to do it energetically and aggressively.
[00:10:27.038 --> 00:10:29.380]  So, that is coming up.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:35.045]  In other news, top bin Laden expert, confession is fake.
[00:10:35.705 --> 00:10:36.586]  We'll go over that.
[00:10:37.957 --> 00:10:40.979]  Also, UN urge to take on asteroid threat.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.801]  We'll get into that PSYOP.
[00:10:44.562 --> 00:10:48.745]  We'll also talk about Palm Beach Police using license tag scanners.
[00:10:49.826 --> 00:10:54.509]  And we'll integrate that with some other important news reports here concerning Big Brother.
[00:10:56.431 --> 00:11:03.796]  But let me just briefly get back into the BBC because I promise to and then we won't cover it again unless you call in about it until the middle of the next hour.
[00:11:05.237 --> 00:11:16.724]  Guy Smith interviewed me again for a week, off and on, at my office, at my other office, at the other broadcast studio, in Dallas, at Dealey Plaza, it just went on and on.
[00:11:17.544 --> 00:11:23.828]  I would have to imagine he probably shot, I don't know, 20 hours with me?
[00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:32.613]  20 hours condensed down to 3 minutes in the film.
[00:11:34.492 --> 00:11:41.095]  And for everybody out there who's writing pieces now, debunking the BBC debunk piece, you need to understand, I'm an eyewitness to this.
[00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:58.501]  He said, we are not going to put Northwoods in, we're not going to let you discuss it, we're not putting Gulf of Tonkin in, we're not putting any real examples of our government claiming they were attacked, the government staging attacks against itself, or the government planning to stage attacks.
[00:11:58.521 --> 00:12:01.503]  Now, wouldn't that be important for a piece about 9-11 truth?
[00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:14.871]  And it's because of behavior like that that Popular Mechanics and BBC and all these other government organs, BBC is publicly government, Popular Mechanics has been government ever since it was founded.
[00:12:16.352 --> 00:12:21.098]  It's because of behavior like that that your hit piece is going to cause more people to wake up.
[00:12:21.818 --> 00:12:22.419]  Guaranteed!
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.061]  Without a shadow of a doubt.
[00:12:24.981 --> 00:12:31.625]  Because you attack the truth with lies and half-truths and straw men, people are going to go investigate.
[00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:36.087]  It's only going to interest them more, and then they're going to find out they were lied to, and they're going to get very, very angry.
[00:12:38.349 --> 00:12:44.752]  So people are mad about this piece, and you should be, but take that anger and put it into the important work of getting the truth out.
[00:12:45.413 --> 00:12:52.837]  And that starts with going and getting the pieces that have been written, analyzing this propaganda, and emailing it, posting it to every
[00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:58.433]  Every sector and every corner and every region of the internet.
[00:12:59.674 --> 00:13:01.154]  It's very important to do that.
[00:13:01.194 --> 00:13:09.676]  But I knew, out of the 20 hours, probably more, of interviews, I knew one clip that was going to be in the piece.
[00:13:09.716 --> 00:13:15.718]  And sure enough, this morning, I hurriedly scanned through it, watching it, and guess what was in there of my meager three minutes of the piece?
[00:13:18.712 --> 00:13:32.617]  The final time they interviewed me was a Sunday night when I was starting the syndicated show out of the KLBJ studios and they put me in the business offices and I was sitting there in a suit sitting on the back of a chair.
[00:13:32.637 --> 00:13:39.600]  They said it looked more official and he started taunting me and trying to get me to get mad and get upset.
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.501]  He knew that I had to go and meet my wife for dinner.
[00:13:41.961 --> 00:13:46.563]  He was going with us with his crew and instead of 30 minutes it went on for almost two hours.
[00:13:49.093 --> 00:13:54.116]  And then I had to sneeze in the middle of talking, and I knew I couldn't say, oh, excuse me, I've got to sneeze.
[00:13:54.156 --> 00:13:54.776]  That would be in there.
[00:13:55.136 --> 00:14:06.002]  So I fight back the sneeze, and I go ahead and talk about Flight 93, but I hesitate, and my eyes water a bit, and I thought, man, that looked like I was stumbling on that question.
[00:14:06.082 --> 00:14:06.902]  That will be in there.
[00:14:07.202 --> 00:14:08.583]  So I said it again.
[00:14:09.975 --> 00:14:11.156]  I said, let me say that again.
[00:14:11.636 --> 00:14:12.356]  And I said it again.
[00:14:12.416 --> 00:14:15.418]  Of course, when I said it again, that isn't what was put in there.
[00:14:15.718 --> 00:14:19.099]  No, when I had to sneeze, but fought back the sneeze.
[00:14:19.119 --> 00:14:19.760]  And again, I knew.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.760]  I said, this will be in there.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:21.921]  This is a hit piece.
[00:14:22.541 --> 00:14:23.381]  Sure enough, it was.
[00:14:23.401 --> 00:14:32.786]  They were getting so frustrated and so angry that day after day, they couldn't get me
[00:14:34.898 --> 00:14:38.179]  Picking at my arm, or they couldn't get me scratching at my ear.
[00:14:38.239 --> 00:14:40.400]  They couldn't get me... I know all their tricks.
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.600]  They couldn't get me blinking.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.561]  They couldn't get me stumbling.
[00:14:43.581 --> 00:14:52.984]  They couldn't... I mean, it was just all basically sound bites continually fired out at them on a hundred other facets and issues concerning 9-11.
[00:14:54.144 --> 00:15:00.986]  And that's why I am, of the three people in there, I am the smallest portion of that.
[00:15:06.511 --> 00:15:09.033]  But they lied to me, just like Popular Mechanics.
[00:15:09.133 --> 00:15:10.595]  Oh, we promise it's not a hit piece.
[00:15:10.615 --> 00:15:12.036]  We promise it's going to be balanced.
[00:15:12.596 --> 00:15:21.384]  Balanced is not eleven people with the government story and three people questioning it.
[00:15:23.348 --> 00:15:36.079]  Balanced is not, hey, the one thing I want to get across is that our government overthrew Iran by staging terror attacks in 53, our government staged attacks on the destroyers of the Gulf of Tonkin in 64, declassified.
[00:15:36.119 --> 00:15:37.260]  Here's the Associated Press.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.661]  I gave them the news articles.
[00:15:39.722 --> 00:15:41.824]  I made a big two-inch thick file for them.
[00:15:43.165 --> 00:15:45.207]  They would just smile and giggle about it.
[00:15:46.227 --> 00:15:47.628]  I want Northwoods to be in there.
[00:15:47.688 --> 00:15:53.232]  Those three issues, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:59.737]  It's just like going into court and not being able to put on your evidence.
[00:16:00.257 --> 00:16:11.025]  But don't worry, in the court of public opinion, your piece will air and it will air all over the world, and people will go into our websites and they'll find out the truth, and they will discover
[00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:13.665]  Who's really putting out the truth.
[00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:15.946]  They will discover what you've done.
[00:16:16.246 --> 00:16:21.507]  So again, you dig a pit for us to fall into it, you fall into it yourself.
[00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:22.687]  Just like the Bible says.
[00:16:23.347 --> 00:16:33.369]  There have been people here locally who have dug pits for myself and others, and they're the ones that fall into their own pits, and then they try to accuse me of digging the pit.
[00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:33.689]  No.
[00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.569]  No.
[00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:36.090]  The BBC dug the pit.
[00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.110]  Popular Mechanics dug the pit.
[00:16:39.148 --> 00:16:47.392]  And some of the other people that I've dealt with dig their own pits and then they crawl into the pits themselves.
[00:16:50.553 --> 00:16:52.954]  And I, again, there's just so many points to this.
[00:16:53.435 --> 00:16:59.597]  Let's get into this report first.
[00:16:59.858 --> 00:17:04.480]  And I've got two different ones here on this subject.
[00:17:06.421 --> 00:17:06.901]  One of them
[00:17:07.714 --> 00:17:11.577]  Headlined, UN Urge to Take Action on Asteroid Threat.
[00:17:12.077 --> 00:17:14.900]  Another similar headline here, out of the Reuters.
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:33.554]  An asteroid may come uncomfortably close to Earth in 2036, and the United Nations should assume responsibility for a space mission to deflect it, a group of astronauts, engineers, and scientists said on Saturday.
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:56.933]  Now you'll probably remember about six years ago I interviewed Mrs. Shoemaker, whose husband died in a car wreck, Mr. Shoemaker, who discovered Shoemaker-Levy, the comet that broke into five pieces and rammed into Jupiter, one chunk of it exploding with the power
[00:17:57.782 --> 00:18:14.697]  of tens of thousands of hydrogen bombs, giant black spots visible through binoculars on a clear night, five huge black explosion marks, one of them very close to the size of the Great Red Spot on Jupiter.
[00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:19.141]  And you're saying, what does that have to do with this report?
[00:18:20.459 --> 00:18:47.374]  It's because of my amateur astronomy behavior, and I took astronomy in college, and again, my dad's got a big telescope, I've got a medium-sized one, that I know a little bit about asteroids, meteors, planetoids, comets, and I have interviewed some of the leading experts in the world on the subject, and it was in that
[00:18:50.777 --> 00:19:09.843]  astronomy buff position of actual, really, entertainment for myself, that I watched a Discovery Channel program, and I believe the other one was a PBS Nova program, years ago, and I learned in those pieces that the U.S.
[00:19:09.903 --> 00:19:16.145]  government, the Russian government, and the shoemakers were there as well, along with Mr. Levy and others,
[00:19:18.502 --> 00:19:20.723]  Shoemakers have discovered like three major comets.
[00:19:20.783 --> 00:19:24.264]  They're just incredible people.
[00:19:24.544 --> 00:19:29.826]  It was through that that I learned of this plan.
[00:19:30.686 --> 00:19:33.107]  I didn't learn it off some conspiracy website.
[00:19:33.147 --> 00:19:37.208]  I didn't learn about it on the back of a Cracker Jack box.
[00:19:38.409 --> 00:19:39.389]  They admit this.
[00:19:40.209 --> 00:19:42.290]  This is staged.
[00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.391]  Not the comet that slammed in.
[00:19:46.255 --> 00:19:56.812]  to Jupiter, but the response to this threat is staged, and I'll briefly break that down on the other side, then we'll get into a bunch of other important news.
[00:19:57.393 --> 00:19:58.255]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:19:58.375 --> 00:19:58.776]  Stay with me.
[00:20:01.747 --> 00:20:05.311]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:20:05.351 --> 00:20:05.872]  are located?
[00:20:06.072 --> 00:20:09.456]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:21:01.078 --> 00:21:01.959]  Ted Anders for Midas.
[00:21:02.019 --> 00:21:02.340]  February 16, 2007.
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:02.840]  Gold 664.90.
[00:21:02.901 --> 00:21:05.184]  Ounce gold coins are at 686.35, 345.73 for half, 172.87 for quarter ounce.
[00:21:05.204 --> 00:21:05.784]  That's 686.35, 345.73, and 172.87.
[00:21:16.278 --> 00:21:18.139]  1971, Nixon closes the gold window.
[00:21:18.199 --> 00:21:23.640]  Fiat currency, 1920s, the German market explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.881]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[00:21:26.901 --> 00:21:29.742]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[00:21:29.762 --> 00:21:33.163]  1998, gold jumps 2 thirds over the Russian ruble.
[00:21:33.443 --> 00:21:36.164]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[00:21:36.404 --> 00:21:41.566]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[00:21:41.726 --> 00:21:43.026]  Could government let this happen?
[00:21:43.146 --> 00:21:45.087]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[00:21:45.367 --> 00:21:52.411]  Midas has Nick Bereshef's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat-tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:54.173]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[00:21:54.233 --> 00:21:57.855]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[00:21:58.235 --> 00:22:01.177]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.237 --> 00:22:03.678]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.259 --> 00:22:10.202]  Did you know that there is a concentration camp program that was designed during the Ronald Reagan administration called Rex 84?
[00:22:11.543 --> 00:22:16.787]  This program is designed to imprison anyone whom the federal government deems an enemy of the state.
[00:22:17.528 --> 00:22:29.257]  A judge in Houston, Texas declared that the plaintiff had proven that there was such a program that existed, but no one had been harmed or imprisoned by it, so he declared it unconstitutional and dismissed the case.
[00:22:30.083 --> 00:22:37.788]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:01.894 --> 00:23:03.955]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:04.576 --> 00:23:13.501]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:13.941 --> 00:23:21.145]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:21.872 --> 00:23:27.356]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:46.609]  We're good.
[00:24:14.441 --> 00:24:25.464]  Big debate coming up with the master of the hit piece, Guy Smith, from the bowels of the British broadcasting commissariat in the third hour.
[00:24:25.484 --> 00:24:30.025]  That was Orwell's last job before he wrote 1984.
[00:24:31.025 --> 00:24:35.286]  The book basically about himself, Winston Smith, working in the Ministry of Truth.
[00:24:38.689 --> 00:24:40.349]  Alright, getting back to U.N.
[00:24:40.469 --> 00:24:42.490]  urge to take action on asteroid threat.
[00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:43.350]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:45.511]  An asteroid may come uncomfortably close to Earth.
[00:24:45.731 --> 00:24:48.132]  May come uncomfortably close to Earth in 2036.
[00:24:48.512 --> 00:24:54.553]  And the United Nations should assume responsibility for a space mission to deflect it.
[00:24:55.033 --> 00:25:00.455]  A group of astronauts, engineers and scientists said on Saturday, astronomers are monitoring an asteroid named
[00:25:01.698 --> 00:25:11.224]  Apophis, which has a 1 in 45,000 chance of striking Earth on April 13, 2036.
[00:25:12.685 --> 00:25:29.655]  Although the odds of an impact by this particular asteroid are low, a recent congressional mandate for NASA to upgrade its tracking of near-Earth asteroids is expected to uncover hundreds, if not thousands, of threatening space rocks in the near future, former astronaut Rusty Sweckhardt said.
[00:25:30.638 --> 00:25:32.760]  It's not just Apophis we're looking at.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.443]  Is that some connection to Apocalypse?
[00:25:37.064 --> 00:25:38.325]  Every country is at risk.
[00:25:38.365 --> 00:25:41.547]  We need a set of general principles to deal with this issue, he said.
[00:25:41.567 --> 00:25:50.215]  A member of the Apollo 9 crew that orbited the moon in March of 1969 told the American Association for the Advancement of Science Conference in San Francisco.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:26:01.044]  Schweckart plans to present an updated next week to the UN Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space on plans to develop a blueprint for global response to an asteroid threat.
[00:26:01.744 --> 00:26:04.525]  And of course, there's several facets to this.
[00:26:06.586 --> 00:26:13.369]  Being somewhat of a buff on this subject, I have seen a NOVA special and a Discovery Channel special.
[00:26:15.899 --> 00:26:18.121]  And read a bunch of news articles over the years.
[00:26:18.481 --> 00:26:24.126]  I've seen video of UN meetings with Russians, Japanese, European Space Agency, NASA.
[00:26:25.306 --> 00:26:36.255]  And they're all meeting saying this is a great way to unite the Earth under the United Nations to defend the planet from the threat of these asteroids and comets.
[00:26:36.935 --> 00:26:45.042]  We've got to put powerful nuclear weapons or particle beams in space that can destroy these asteroids.
[00:26:46.187 --> 00:26:57.553]  So on the surface, it'll be a big hyped up deal with the United Nations defending the Earth, the planet coming together, humans coming together to the outside threat.
[00:26:58.174 --> 00:27:01.556]  Kissinger wrote about that in documents and it's in the report on Iron Mountain.
[00:27:02.536 --> 00:27:16.179]  It came out that the Sci-Fi Channel had federal government funding and Clinton's former chief of staff involved in a program to propagandize that we must all come together to fight the extraterrestrials, i.e., again, back to H.G.
[00:27:16.219 --> 00:27:18.940]  Wells, one of their top futurists, War of the Worlds.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.521]  But that's only one facet to this.
[00:27:22.941 --> 00:27:26.882]  This is also an excuse for the United Nations to weaponize space
[00:27:27.975 --> 00:27:33.957]  Because these weapons that can be turned outward can just as easily be turned inward.
[00:27:35.518 --> 00:27:45.081]  With particle beams, missiles, and of course their main weapon, huge, solid, depleted uranium
[00:27:46.343 --> 00:28:09.697]  projectiles that are rocket-assisted out of orbital platforms or space planes and dropped into gravity wells to accelerate to over 25,000 miles an hour, having the same effect in their distribution of energy as a medium-sized hydrogen nuclear bomb.
[00:28:12.222 --> 00:28:16.966]  And I've had discussions with the former head of Star Wars program.
[00:28:16.986 --> 00:28:22.670]  I remember at the 9-11 Neo-Conagena Symposium in L.A., I talked to Bowman, Dr. Bob Bowman, for about an hour behind the scenes.
[00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:27.514]  He said, look, I can't tell you anything classified, but I can tell you what they've slipped up and said.
[00:28:30.476 --> 00:28:41.885]  And he said, one time I was in a debate with one of the current heads of Star Wars, and he just went ahead and admitted that they had these robotic space planes and these DU projectiles.
[00:28:43.061 --> 00:28:44.522]  Like a meteor gun, basically.
[00:28:45.582 --> 00:29:01.031]  But you take something with that mass, and you accelerate it, using the gravity well, with a rocket assist, and you fire a hypersonic missile, with a DU tip, into the Earth's gravity well, at the proper angulation, it's just unbelievable.
[00:29:01.751 --> 00:29:06.033]  And I said, obviously there's not humans piloting those, and he said, no, it's space planes.
[00:29:06.654 --> 00:29:07.894]  Robotic space planes.
[00:29:07.914 --> 00:29:10.576]  They're up there, flying around, right now,
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:36.657]  uh... in the edge of space and in space itself and uh... that's what's happening they can decapitate the entire leadership of the planet if they can ever target exactly where they're all at once I've been told there's another of these space planes and Jane's Weapons Quarterly has reported on it too they told you what four years before the B-2 bomber was rolled out about it of course that thing was in service back in the seventies
[00:29:37.701 --> 00:29:43.843]  They still say the SR-71 Blackbird, developed in 1955, is the fastest plane in the world.
[00:29:44.003 --> 00:29:47.144]  Do you think a plane from 1955 is still the fastest?
[00:29:47.344 --> 00:29:48.785]  Do you really believe that?
[00:29:51.346 --> 00:29:52.266]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.746 --> 00:29:54.327]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.347 --> 00:29:57.928]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.192 --> 00:30:02.292]  How are you feeling today?

[00:30:47.199 --> 00:30:47.539]  I think so.
[00:31:14.195 --> 00:31:14.596]  We're good.
[00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:33.299]  I think so.
[00:32:02.122 --> 00:32:03.282]  Hey Jane, how's it going?
[00:32:03.643 --> 00:32:05.563]  Gosh, I'm not doing so well.
[00:32:05.783 --> 00:32:09.744]  Even though I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do, my blood sugar is way out of control.
[00:32:10.285 --> 00:32:11.965]  Oh Jane, I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:32:12.205 --> 00:32:14.266]  I have to monitor my blood sugar again.
[00:32:14.506 --> 00:32:19.627]  If there was only something natural I could take that would help control my blood sugar that really works.
[00:32:19.928 --> 00:32:21.248]  Have you tried Sucroblast?

[00:33:02.425 --> 00:33:07.608]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.248 --> 00:33:10.570]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:18.197 --> 00:33:20.518]  We're going to have open phones today.
[00:33:20.538 --> 00:33:23.759]  The toll-free number to join us if you saw the BBC hit piece last night.
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:31.061]  Or if you want to comment on what's happening with the build-up for war with Iran or the UN.
[00:33:31.121 --> 00:33:34.542]  World government's got to save us with space-based weapons.
[00:33:34.623 --> 00:33:38.844]  And if you think they're for asteroids, I've got a bridge I want to sell you in Manhattan.
[00:33:40.498 --> 00:33:41.679]  There's a hundred different issues.
[00:33:41.699 --> 00:33:46.883]  You're welcome to call us at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:47.864 --> 00:33:52.007]  Before I get back into the news, there's a lot of big things we want to do here at this office.
[00:33:53.869 --> 00:34:02.675]  And for about a year, I've just been so busy making films and doing other things, I haven't had time to launch a plan I've had for a long time.
[00:34:03.576 --> 00:34:06.919]  Basically, it's no secret, an internet portal
[00:34:08.678 --> 00:34:14.683]  And by portal, I wanted to have all the functions that the major portals have.
[00:34:14.743 --> 00:34:17.166]  I'm going to have to hire three or four people to do it.
[00:34:17.246 --> 00:34:18.106]  I'm in the process.
[00:34:18.547 --> 00:34:19.428]  I have the space.
[00:34:19.948 --> 00:34:21.229]  I have two of the people hired.
[00:34:21.269 --> 00:34:22.290]  I need to hire two more.
[00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:28.375]  Please don't send me a million requests or your resumes.
[00:34:28.415 --> 00:34:29.616]  I haven't gotten to that point yet.
[00:34:29.957 --> 00:34:33.480]  I'm so busy trying to make another film, do this radio show, do other radio interviews.
[00:34:34.981 --> 00:34:35.742]  Manage things.
[00:34:35.822 --> 00:34:36.462]  Pay the bills.
[00:34:36.522 --> 00:34:37.523]  Take out the trash.
[00:34:38.463 --> 00:34:39.063]  Make dinner.
[00:34:40.964 --> 00:34:41.805]  You know what life's like.
[00:34:42.105 --> 00:34:42.906]  I'm not complaining.
[00:34:42.926 --> 00:34:47.028]  I'm just letting you know that my big frustration in life is I can't do everything I want to do.
[00:34:49.089 --> 00:34:49.709]  But it will.
[00:34:49.729 --> 00:34:54.892]  I mean, I'm so busy fighting the New World Order, folks, that I get advertising requests every day.
[00:34:55.833 --> 00:35:03.577]  And if I pick the phone up and call and sell the person for five minutes, I can have advertisers on the websites, on the radio show.
[00:35:03.737 --> 00:35:04.498]  I'm so busy
[00:35:05.755 --> 00:35:10.718]  That I don't even have time to do that, much less even hire somebody to be a salesman.
[00:35:11.158 --> 00:35:12.659]  And I know I should just get that done.
[00:35:12.719 --> 00:35:21.184]  I should worry about financial stuff first and then get into all the nuts and bolts later.
[00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:32.591]  But the best way to support us so we can do all these things that we want to do and fight the New World Order at an even higher level, and you know we've been effective with God's help.
[00:35:33.031 --> 00:35:34.012]  All the glory goes to God.
[00:35:35.609 --> 00:35:36.430]  Please help us.
[00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.631]  And you do that, it's very simple.
[00:35:38.671 --> 00:35:55.644]  You go to InfoWars.com, and you look at all the books and videos, DVDs, books on tape, pro-Second Amendment t-shirts, anti-tyranny t-shirts, 9-11 inside job t-shirts, and you purchase a wheelbarrow full of them.
[00:35:58.366 --> 00:36:01.168]  And then, I can do everything I want to do easily.
[00:36:02.958 --> 00:36:04.178]  Because that's our goal here.
[00:36:04.239 --> 00:36:05.259]  That's what we're into.
[00:36:05.699 --> 00:36:07.360]  Everybody's got something that floats their boat.
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.420]  Everybody's got something that's their passion.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.321]  My passion is standing up to tyranny.
[00:36:11.881 --> 00:36:12.642]  I am addicted.
[00:36:12.822 --> 00:36:13.642]  I am obsessed.
[00:36:13.862 --> 00:36:19.104]  I am literally energized with the spirit of resistance to this tyranny.
[00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:21.752]  Every fiber in my body.
[00:36:22.092 --> 00:36:23.734]  But look, it's not just supporting us.
[00:36:23.794 --> 00:36:25.815]  Number one, these films will wake people up.
[00:36:25.895 --> 00:36:31.880]  Terror Storm, Loose Change 2nd Edition, 9-11, Mysteries, Demolitions, America, Freedom to Fascism.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:35.683]  We got discounts on all of them at Infowars.com.
[00:36:35.723 --> 00:36:40.226]  They are priced to move, to get the information out to you, and to help us operate.
[00:36:41.487 --> 00:36:46.451]  Hundreds of titles and videos and books on the online video bookstore.
[00:36:47.782 --> 00:36:57.490]  It is so important to go to InfoWars.com today and to order the books and the videos and to get them out to people.
[00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:00.912]  The toll-free number to order, you can call and ask about different specials.
[00:37:00.932 --> 00:37:02.173]  There's like 20-something of them.
[00:37:02.193 --> 00:37:02.914]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:02.934 --> 00:37:03.154]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:37:14.489 --> 00:37:23.394]  Or you can write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:37:23.854 --> 00:37:31.939]  When you move, when you take action, when you stand up, when you get involved in little ways, those grow into big things.
[00:37:33.012 --> 00:37:48.224]  And all of us together instantly become something huge, and that's why the New World Order is literally panicking and admitting in Popular Mechanics and BBC and Vanity Fair and the New York Post that we have convinced the majority of the public that we're winning.
[00:37:50.005 --> 00:37:52.447]  We're winning on the Second Amendment issues.
[00:37:52.487 --> 00:37:53.808]  We're winning on the borders.
[00:37:54.248 --> 00:37:55.309]  That is for the hearts and minds.
[00:37:55.329 --> 00:37:56.210]  They're still getting rid of them.
[00:37:56.590 --> 00:38:00.073]  We're winning when it comes to the NAFTA highways, to the North American Union,
[00:38:03.616 --> 00:38:08.561]  We can have a reprieve for a time to wake up more people if we take action.
[00:38:08.581 --> 00:38:09.462]  That's God's promise.
[00:38:09.522 --> 00:38:12.785]  So, please take action.
[00:38:13.846 --> 00:38:15.067]  Please take action today.
[00:38:15.488 --> 00:38:16.288]  Infowars.com
[00:38:17.563 --> 00:38:23.568]  Now let me shift gears on this subject before we play a clip and go to your calls and cover other news and talk about Anna Nicole Smith and Britney Spears.
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.641]  No, I'm not joking.
[00:38:47.761 --> 00:38:48.361]  I'm serious.
[00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:51.763]  When Anna Nicole Smith died a week and a half ago, we haven't mentioned it, have we?
[00:38:53.944 --> 00:39:01.607]  When Britney Spears, over the weekend, shaved off all her hair, and that was top story, not to build up for war with Iran, I didn't cover it Sunday.
[00:39:03.568 --> 00:39:07.410]  But last night, eating dinner with my family, I thought of those two women.
[00:39:10.391 --> 00:39:13.953]  And so now I'll share with you why I'm bringing them up.
[00:39:14.725 --> 00:39:23.914]  You have a woman, Anna Nicole Smith, who's beautiful, who's intelligent, and she was intelligent.
[00:39:23.934 --> 00:39:25.795]  I've seen interviews with her 10, 15 years ago.
[00:39:25.855 --> 00:39:27.977]  She was just completely drugged out every time you saw her.
[00:39:28.618 --> 00:39:29.419]  Who had everything.
[00:39:29.459 --> 00:39:37.286]  Who was a billionaire from her marriage and who had made tens of millions of dollars a year from modeling films and perfume lines.
[00:39:38.115 --> 00:39:40.157]  She had a healthy, happy son.
[00:39:40.897 --> 00:39:41.938]  She'd had a new daughter.
[00:39:42.439 --> 00:39:44.340]  Her son died, obviously, of drugs.
[00:39:45.321 --> 00:39:49.324]  She died of drugs, or foul play, who knows, of the people she was running with.
[00:39:50.765 --> 00:39:51.746]  Why do I bring her up?
[00:39:55.469 --> 00:40:00.733]  Well, what would it profit a man to gain the whole world, but lose his eternal soul?
[00:40:04.156 --> 00:40:07.439]  You look at people like Anna Nicole Smith,
[00:40:08.157 --> 00:40:23.888]  You look at people like Britney Spears, made hundreds of millions of dollars, in and out of rehab, completely unhappy, going crazy, getting tattoos all over her body, and shaving her head saying, help me, help me, and I don't think that was a stunt.
[00:40:23.968 --> 00:40:31.754]  I looked into her eyes on the video of her in that tattoo parlor, and she was completely out of her gourd.
[00:40:33.315 --> 00:40:35.076]  Completely whacked out.
[00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:37.822]  Totally unhappy.
[00:40:38.302 --> 00:40:39.704]  I know people in Hollywood that know her.
[00:40:40.164 --> 00:40:41.445]  Totally unhappy.
[00:40:41.986 --> 00:40:48.271]  All the drugs, all the liquor, all the sex, all the Bentley's, all the 20 bedroom homes.
[00:40:49.473 --> 00:40:50.553]  It's not going to make her happy.
[00:40:52.135 --> 00:40:53.736]  And then I just thought about myself.
[00:40:56.499 --> 00:40:57.780]  I frankly am too happy.
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:59.021]  Too satisfied.
[00:40:59.081 --> 00:41:02.084]  I'm so satisfied I get to the point where I don't even care how I look.
[00:41:03.815 --> 00:41:04.736]  In the past, I did.
[00:41:04.756 --> 00:41:05.597]  I was more vain.
[00:41:06.017 --> 00:41:07.538]  I think there's a balance to everything in life.
[00:41:08.119 --> 00:41:09.940]  I think I've gone too far in the other direction.
[00:41:13.002 --> 00:41:14.263]  I am so fulfilled.
[00:41:14.324 --> 00:41:17.426]  I mean, last night I left the Sunday show I did at 6 o'clock.
[00:41:17.886 --> 00:41:32.158]  I'm driving home and I'm up on the overpasses and I see one of the most beautiful and spectacular sunsets I've ever seen with gold and silver and red and orange and purple just shooting out indescribable beauty.
[00:41:33.612 --> 00:41:59.320]  And the green trees, and just the glint of the cars, and the highway, and I thought, here I am driving 70 miles an hour, this feeling of exhilaration on an open road with almost no traffic, and there's blackbirds, grackles, and starlings, and clouds in the skies, and I rolled down the windows and felt the 60 degree air just wash over me, and I just was thanking God!
[00:42:00.061 --> 00:42:00.281]  I mean,
[00:42:02.037 --> 00:42:12.251]  Last night it was a beautiful night sky, dotted clouds like popcorn, and stars and planets.
[00:42:12.671 --> 00:42:17.618]  I was walking around outside in the cold, dew-lit grass.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:47.132]  I was just carrying the trash out and I was just such a blessing to even be alive and to see all of this and to be able to go to the woods and sit on a blanket with binoculars and watch gophers dig out their holes and squirrels and eagles land in a tree and owls and robins and to just I mean it's we are so blessed there is so much good in the world
[00:42:48.604 --> 00:42:53.489]  But last night at about 7 o'clock I sat down to have dinner with my wife and children.
[00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.393]  And I looked at their glowing, happy, innocent faces.
[00:42:57.413 --> 00:42:59.896]  They looked like cherubs.
[00:42:59.916 --> 00:43:03.279]  And they were eating with gusto and happy.
[00:43:03.319 --> 00:43:06.683]  And their eyes were alive with life force and electricity.
[00:43:07.982 --> 00:43:35.528]  and I looked at my beautiful wife and then after dinner my children were making up songs for like an hour singing and they were playing with Legos and building Tyrannosaurus Rex's you know my two-year-old with Legos just built something with just like a Tyrannosaurus and said look and my son was building rockets they were building cities with blocks and and and it was just and they were singing making up these funny songs and they were so happy and I just thought
[00:43:37.973 --> 00:43:40.675]  God has just blessed all of us so much.
[00:43:42.576 --> 00:43:44.157]  I know myself more than most.
[00:43:45.278 --> 00:43:54.784]  And I just am completely humbled and blown away and it makes me just feel like dirty rags compared to God's incredible creation and what He's given us.
[00:43:59.287 --> 00:44:02.709]  And then I just thought about how sad Anna Nicole Smith is.
[00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:05.367]  I thought about how sad Britney Spears is.
[00:44:05.767 --> 00:44:16.830]  I thought about all these rich and powerful people that I've had a chance to get to know, and how so many times they're completely unhappy unless they're into whatever issue fulfills them.
[00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:21.751]  You know, trying to save the environment, or trying to stand up for sovereignty, or being informed about 9-11.
[00:44:21.851 --> 00:44:23.671]  You know, they have a passion.
[00:44:23.711 --> 00:44:24.371]  They're involved.
[00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:25.851]  They want to make the world a better place.
[00:44:25.871 --> 00:44:26.432]  They're happy.
[00:44:26.772 --> 00:44:28.432]  If they're not, they're totally unhappy.
[00:44:30.333 --> 00:44:34.915]  There's another type of individual who's evil who likes power and the exercise of power.
[00:44:34.995 --> 00:44:36.436]  They could care less about a sunset.
[00:44:36.476 --> 00:44:38.157]  They could care less about beautiful art.
[00:44:39.437 --> 00:44:48.642]  They could care less about just all the kaleidoscope of colors and smells and taste and touch and feelings in our world.
[00:44:48.662 --> 00:44:58.026]  And there's the endless palette of so many shades you can't even... so many shades of three dimension you can't even comprehend it.
[00:44:58.106 --> 00:44:59.447]  You can just feel it in your soul.
[00:45:02.774 --> 00:45:03.814]  I thought about the evil.
[00:45:03.875 --> 00:45:14.739]  They've gone so far into darkness and destruction that they've always got to go one level deeper just to even have any feeling.
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:26.284]  And they revel in trying to hurt people, and they revel in trying to control people, and they revel in destroying happiness and goodness.
[00:45:27.387 --> 00:45:31.450]  Watching the actions of elites throughout history and the more things change the more they stay the same.
[00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:32.952]  Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat them.
[00:45:33.132 --> 00:45:34.433]  Because humans act the same.
[00:45:34.473 --> 00:45:35.734]  We are always the same.
[00:45:38.456 --> 00:45:39.657]  There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:45:39.817 --> 00:45:42.620]  There's different projections of old.
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.422]  Different configurations of what already was.
[00:45:48.284 --> 00:45:49.465]  You say the computers knew.
[00:45:49.745 --> 00:45:49.966]  No.
[00:45:50.026 --> 00:45:50.846]  What is the mind?
[00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:55.150]  So,
[00:45:57.509 --> 00:46:17.289]  Again, Madison Avenue are masters of making us feel inadequate, making us feel like we don't matter, making us feel like because we don't have the trappings and because we don't have the logos of success that we aren't successful.
[00:46:18.084 --> 00:46:30.287]  And then so we've got to go to them and watch their television commercials and find out how we're inadequate to then go basically slave and work for them to buy things that don't even matter to the globalists.
[00:46:30.307 --> 00:46:44.310]  They just produce these bottles to then hand them out to us like tin medals that Napoleon would hand out and he bragged that, look at how men will throw themselves on the ends of pikes just to get a piece of tin.
[00:46:46.357 --> 00:46:51.998]  That's all it is, is these little tricks they learned, but more and more sophisticated, being used against us.
[00:46:52.398 --> 00:47:01.580]  I mean, the world is just going by, past you, while you're mesmerized by the television and by the culture and by this overall fraud.
[00:47:04.061 --> 00:47:13.243]  So I really think we start defeating the New World Order by humbling ourselves and by looking at the beauty around us, looking at the blessings around us, and then
[00:47:15.299 --> 00:47:26.524]  Tapping into the greater whole and having an attitude of sacrifice, having an attitude of the servant, having the attitude of submission to what is right.
[00:47:26.705 --> 00:47:29.666]  And by submitting to right, it means you resist the wrong.
[00:47:31.967 --> 00:47:39.931]  And the more you go down this path, and you're still going to be a bad person, you're still going to be fallen, you're still going to have problems, but by always striving
[00:47:40.842 --> 00:47:54.934]  To be better, by always striving to be more appreciative, by always striving to be more meek, by always striving to stand up for the defenseless, you will become stronger and stronger and stronger and more fulfilled.
[00:47:57.716 --> 00:48:06.364]  And your mind will open up to the world, your discernment, your understanding will increase exponentially.
[00:48:08.763 --> 00:48:15.388]  And I am just so sad because I'm a very sharing person and I've always taken great pleasure in others having pleasure.
[00:48:19.431 --> 00:48:21.913]  I enjoy others having pleasure.
[00:48:22.053 --> 00:48:24.555]  I enjoy others having a good time.
[00:48:25.155 --> 00:48:27.157]  I enjoy others being fulfilled.
[00:48:27.877 --> 00:48:35.423]  And I see so many out there who are jealous and envious and self-centered and they wonder why they're so unhappy and they are
[00:48:36.565 --> 00:48:37.967]  They are envious.
[00:48:38.067 --> 00:48:40.309]  They are hateful of others that are successful.
[00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:44.334]  They think they have to tear everyone down around them so they can be successful.
[00:48:44.734 --> 00:48:46.676]  That's what David Rockefeller is all about.
[00:48:46.997 --> 00:48:49.459]  That's what Queen Elizabeth is all about.
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.462]  That's what Queen Beatrix is all about.
[00:48:51.502 --> 00:48:54.305]  That's what Lord Rothschild is all about.
[00:48:55.279 --> 00:48:58.561]  They're all about damaging people.
[00:48:58.861 --> 00:49:00.983]  They're all about dumbing people down.
[00:49:01.043 --> 00:49:02.604]  I mean, to me, that's the ultimate sin.
[00:49:03.184 --> 00:49:08.608]  Trying to warp people, trying to damage people, trying to hurt innocents.
[00:49:09.068 --> 00:49:11.790]  I mean, how could you not want to build for human potential?
[00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:14.611]  How could you not want to construct beautiful things?
[00:49:14.891 --> 00:49:20.215]  How could you not want to help others and have camaraderie and to collaborate?
[00:49:20.715 --> 00:49:26.380]  How could you not want to be part of that and part of the human experience?
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:32.104]  Well, most people really do, deep down, want to do that, but they've been taught how to be evil.
[00:49:32.344 --> 00:49:33.986]  They've been taught how to be self-centered.
[00:49:34.186 --> 00:49:35.807]  They've been taught how to be cynical.
[00:49:36.147 --> 00:49:39.470]  They've been taught how to serve power and corruption.
[00:49:41.127 --> 00:49:44.269]  And they're losing out in this one life to live.
[00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:46.911]  They're losing out on this one time on this planet.
[00:49:47.211 --> 00:49:53.375]  They're losing out on this one time, one shot experience and it's being stolen from them.
[00:50:00.493 --> 00:50:03.615]  I want you, all of you, to be successful and live well.
[00:50:04.315 --> 00:50:14.681]  It tears my heart out to think that right now children are being given their final round of vaccines at 18 months that will cause them to go into a coma state or into deep autism.
[00:50:15.901 --> 00:50:29.689]  It tears my heart out to know right now black children, predominantly all over this country, are being taken from their parents to have pesticides and experimental drugs tested on them until they, in many cases, die.
[00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:39.697]  It tears my guts out to know right now a small child in Russia is being kidnapped out of their house to be flown to Saudi Arabia for a snuff film.
[00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:45.361]  It tears my guts out that evil is being practiced right out in front of us.
[00:50:45.802 --> 00:50:54.208]  And many people have been so bathed in wickedness they can't even recognize evil when they see it on television shows like 24 Torture Children.
[00:50:54.588 --> 00:50:57.310]  That's because they're introducing you to their world.
[00:50:58.251 --> 00:50:59.212]  Their atmosphere.
[00:51:04.568 --> 00:51:10.034]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.395 --> 00:51:18.043]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.726 --> 00:51:25.768]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.188 --> 00:51:37.611]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.911 --> 00:51:41.372]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.872 --> 00:51:43.813]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.133 --> 00:51:47.974]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:07.023 --> 00:54:13.508]  Ooh, why Mother, should I build a wall?
[00:54:13.828 --> 00:54:20.113]  Mother, should I run for President?
[00:54:35.629 --> 00:54:39.091]  Mother, should I trust the government?
[00:54:39.191 --> 00:54:46.435]  Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
[00:55:09.189 --> 00:55:12.732]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:16.334 --> 00:55:21.217]  Went into preacher mode earlier.
[00:55:21.837 --> 00:55:24.499]  George Bush is going to put all his fears into you.
[00:55:24.619 --> 00:55:24.919]  Roll it.
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:46.524]  Alright.
[00:55:48.144 --> 00:55:51.185]  Ray, Andrew, John, Wendy, others, we're going to get to your calls.
[00:55:51.365 --> 00:55:53.385]  We'll take your calls right through to the bottom of the hour.
[00:55:54.386 --> 00:55:56.586]  There's so much other news here, like the New York Post.
[00:55:56.626 --> 00:55:59.167]  Those who oppose Surge in Congress are guilty of treason.
[00:55:59.347 --> 00:56:00.087]  It's getting scary.
[00:56:00.854 --> 00:56:01.514]  We'll go over that.
[00:56:01.554 --> 00:56:04.375]  I got a bunch of police state news I will get to, I've got to get to.
[00:56:04.395 --> 00:56:05.996]  I didn't cover it yesterday, ran out of time.
[00:56:06.436 --> 00:56:08.016]  Right now, let's go to Ray in Texas.
[00:56:08.036 --> 00:56:09.897]  Thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[00:56:10.177 --> 00:56:13.498]  Hey Alex, you were talking about the so-called space plane?
[00:56:14.758 --> 00:56:15.078]  Yes sir.
[00:56:15.798 --> 00:56:24.581]  Okay, if you do a Google search and look up T as in Tom, R as in Ray, 3, and then B as in boy, you will
[00:56:25.596 --> 00:56:26.917]  It's called the TR-3B.
[00:56:27.577 --> 00:56:32.519]  Yeah, NASA admits they've been secretly developing it and they'll show artist renditions for 25 years.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:41.924]  They've got big ones, little ones, cargo carriers, attack craft, they've got the Black Manta, they've got the Aurora, there's a bunch of them.
[00:56:42.704 --> 00:56:49.648]  If you go to YouTube and look up Phoenix UFO, it'll pull up 10 years ago.
[00:56:49.668 --> 00:56:52.169]  Remember that big UFO over Phoenix that everybody saw?
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.101]  You have the giant V-Craft and stuff?
[00:56:54.141 --> 00:56:54.762]  Yes, yes.
[00:56:54.842 --> 00:56:56.083]  That was a TR-3B.
[00:56:56.103 --> 00:56:58.825]  They were moving in from Area 51 to Area 52.
[00:57:01.287 --> 00:57:02.348]  There's no doubt they have it.
[00:57:02.408 --> 00:57:09.154]  I mean, Jane's Weapons Quarterly is never wrong, in my experience, and they say for two decades they've had space planes.
[00:57:09.734 --> 00:57:11.676]  We have a fleet of them up in orbit right now.
[00:57:11.716 --> 00:57:14.318]  The space shuttle keeps fighting them.
[00:57:14.919 --> 00:57:17.160]  Fox keeps blowing it up as space debris.
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:21.344]  They'll say at the first of the day, oh, there's a UFO in the same orbit as the shuttle.
[00:57:23.003 --> 00:57:24.543]  Now, see, you lose me there.
[00:57:24.583 --> 00:57:26.424]  What do you mean the space shuttle's fighting them?
[00:57:27.464 --> 00:57:28.924]  No, no, I said they're siding them.
[00:57:29.384 --> 00:57:29.884]  They see them.
[00:57:30.425 --> 00:57:31.825]  Oh, yeah, siding them.
[00:57:31.865 --> 00:57:33.365]  Sorry, your phone's breaking up.
[00:57:33.745 --> 00:57:35.045]  Yeah, somebody's trying to get through to me.
[00:57:35.145 --> 00:57:35.625]  They can wait.
[00:57:37.586 --> 00:57:40.967]  Anyway, they keep siding them, and you can find it on YouTube also.
[00:57:41.127 --> 00:57:46.868]  No, I've seen the famous videos out of the shuttle where you see stuff flying around, and they go, oh, it's green men.
[00:57:47.428 --> 00:57:48.608]  No, it's black ops.
[00:57:49.229 --> 00:57:52.491]  They report it on CNN, and then Fox blows it off.
[00:57:54.231 --> 00:57:57.853]  It's funny, because CNN will report it, and then Fox will report it, but then Fox will blow it off.
[00:57:58.493 --> 00:57:59.854]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[00:57:59.894 --> 00:58:00.514]  It's a good point.
[00:58:01.535 --> 00:58:02.896]  But it's not just the space planes.
[00:58:02.916 --> 00:58:06.757]  There's all this advanced technology that's been developed, that's been kept secret.
[00:58:06.838 --> 00:58:16.942]  Again, the SR-71 Blackbird, built in 1954, in service a few years later, by 55, is not the fastest plane at Mach 3.5 or whatever.
[00:58:19.179 --> 00:58:20.601]  That is just ridiculous.
[00:58:22.623 --> 00:58:24.225]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[00:58:24.986 --> 00:58:36.039]  And you look at all these sightings they see in New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, California, Nevada, and it's exactly what NASA said 30 years ago they were going to build.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:38.302]  They're just keeping it secret from the public.
[00:58:41.286 --> 00:58:46.309]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.329 --> 00:58:46.850]  Big Brother.
[00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.910]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:49.051]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:49.071 --> 00:58:53.614]  You want answers?
[00:58:53.874 --> 00:58:56.275]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.142 --> 00:59:31.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones Now into our number two big debate with the BBC hit piece captain Guy Smith coming on in the third hour Middle and Avery to comment on it before he joins us in 30 minutes continuing with open phones tons of news Let's go to Andrew in Missouri.
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:33.862]  Thanks for holding your on the air worldwide
[00:59:34.605 --> 00:59:39.528]  Yeah, I want to talk about the oil companies and their currency of petrochemicals.
[00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:45.252]  The oil companies and their currency of petrochemicals.
[00:59:45.292 --> 00:59:47.053]  Sir, your phone disconnected.
[00:59:47.534 --> 00:59:49.715]  You're welcome to try to call back in.
[00:59:50.256 --> 00:59:52.137]  John in New York, you're on the air.
[00:59:52.197 --> 00:59:52.577]  Welcome.
[00:59:53.238 --> 00:59:54.258]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me.
[00:59:54.559 --> 00:59:54.879]  You bet.
[00:59:56.140 --> 01:00:01.103]  I watched the BBC thing and it always, I'm sorry, it brought up something that I've always questioned about.
[01:00:01.753 --> 01:00:07.379]  On the second impact of the planes on the World Trade Centers, all the videos record something happening.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:15.968]  When the plane impacts, it looks like on the opposite side of the towers when the plane impacted, it looks like something was ejected from the building.
[01:00:17.149 --> 01:00:23.636]  And this object that came out has this smoke trail that has a little corkscrew formation to it, and it actually looks like
[01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:27.024]  Some sort of a missile or a pod coming out the outside.
[01:00:27.044 --> 01:00:33.949]  Well, I mean, when you've got a plane at 560 miles an hour slamming into a building, pieces are going to accelerate out the other end.
[01:00:33.969 --> 01:00:34.689]  Right.
[01:00:34.709 --> 01:00:37.051]  So it just looks like aircraft flying into a building to me.
[01:00:37.852 --> 01:00:38.032]  Right.
[01:00:38.052 --> 01:00:39.433]  That was just something I was curious about.
[01:00:39.913 --> 01:00:43.196]  I also wanted to comment on Britney Spears, if I may real quick.
[01:00:43.316 --> 01:00:43.696]  Sure.
[01:00:43.756 --> 01:00:47.779]  Her shaving her head, I think that's her saying, all right, I can't take much more of this.
[01:00:48.039 --> 01:00:51.882]  I think she's tired of the spotlight, so she needs to lash out.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:55.063]  And this seems to be the way she decided too.
[01:00:56.565 --> 01:01:00.349]  Well, she's admittedly in rehab and got a lot of problems.
[01:01:00.409 --> 01:01:06.936]  My point is that they're totally unhappy people because they thought power and success was the answer to everything and it's not.
[01:01:07.937 --> 01:01:08.818]  Shame, it really is.
[01:01:09.579 --> 01:01:10.500]  That's why I brought it up.
[01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:16.869]  Even a person living in a one-room apartment has got enough to eat.
[01:01:16.909 --> 01:01:21.154]  I mean, just to go out to the park and feast your eyes on the life and to see the sky.
[01:01:21.194 --> 01:01:22.836]  I mean, it's an incredible experience.
[01:01:23.297 --> 01:01:23.838]  Oh, definitely.
[01:01:23.858 --> 01:01:28.964]  I mean, maybe something's wrong with me, but I just am just, like, unbelievably happy and thankful.
[01:01:29.925 --> 01:01:30.346]  Oh, I know.
[01:01:30.366 --> 01:01:32.028]  Just simple things like that are just...
[01:01:32.515 --> 01:01:34.495]  Waking up and watching the sunrise itself, too.
[01:01:34.615 --> 01:01:36.196]  I mean, that's fulfilling in itself.
[01:01:36.616 --> 01:01:37.436]  Just think about life.
[01:01:37.536 --> 01:01:42.417]  A beautiful sunrise, a cup of coffee, your family, good food.
[01:01:42.477 --> 01:01:46.118]  I mean, the simple things of life are a good walk.
[01:01:46.658 --> 01:01:47.038]  Oh, I know.
[01:01:47.098 --> 01:01:50.239]  I see some things about her upon occasions on the Internet.
[01:01:50.279 --> 01:01:53.500]  I mean, she's running around with Paris Hilton, partying, this and that.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.200]  I think it's starting to catch up with Brittany.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.981]  I mean, she's been in the spotlight as far back as she can recall.
[01:02:00.773 --> 01:02:04.959]  I hope she doesn't turn out to be another Michael Jackson or something like that.
[01:02:11.147 --> 01:02:15.031]  You know, then when they, quote, lose their looks, I don't think women ever lose their looks.
[01:02:15.071 --> 01:02:19.154]  There's something beautiful, just like an old oak tree about an old woman.
[01:02:21.396 --> 01:02:22.658]  Again, they just don't understand.
[01:02:22.678 --> 01:02:24.740]  And it's the same thing with men.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:31.846]  Men think it's this petty male thing of acting tough and being aggressive, but not aggressive on the issues that matter.
[01:02:32.226 --> 01:02:34.669]  You know, you're a man because you get drunk and watch football.
[01:02:35.225 --> 01:02:37.847]  You made a good point on one of your weekly reports.
[01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:42.572]  You say, oh, these gold-digging women, they love these rich guys who's going to go bankrupt in two years.
[01:02:42.612 --> 01:02:43.412]  They just don't see it.
[01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:45.094]  That was a really good point you brought up.
[01:02:46.175 --> 01:02:47.916]  Well, I appreciate your comments, sir.
[01:02:47.957 --> 01:02:48.457]  Anything else?
[01:02:49.858 --> 01:02:51.039]  Buffalo, New York loves you, Al.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.241]  Well, we love you guys up there.
[01:02:53.822 --> 01:02:54.743]  How are you listening to us there?
[01:02:55.343 --> 01:02:56.624]  I'm on the internet as we speak.
[01:02:57.445 --> 01:03:00.508]  Because there is an affiliate that goes into the edge of Buffalo.
[01:03:01.628 --> 01:03:05.550]  I know we have two affiliates in upstate New York, which you might dial around.
[01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:09.171]  I forget the call letters, but listen, I really appreciate your call.
[01:03:09.211 --> 01:03:09.611]  Take care.
[01:03:10.892 --> 01:03:13.633]  We're going to break and come back and go to Wendy and others.
[01:03:13.673 --> 01:03:16.654]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:16.674 --> 01:03:22.416]  We're going to play this Glenn Beck clip coming up as well and analyze it.
[01:03:23.056 --> 01:03:27.158]  And we've got New York Post, those who impose surge in Congress are guilty of treason.
[01:03:28.047 --> 01:03:30.710]  The license plate scanning cameras are going in nationwide.
[01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:32.772]  The face scanning cameras have been in.
[01:03:32.912 --> 01:03:34.354]  Now they're announcing them to you.
[01:03:35.435 --> 01:03:39.399]  Checkpoints to make sure you've got your tracker chips in your cars with the toll roads.
[01:03:40.681 --> 01:03:42.423]  It's just all off the charts.
[01:03:42.723 --> 01:03:47.208]  It's coming up in the next one hour and 55 minutes.
[01:03:47.288 --> 01:03:48.890]  PrisonPlanet.com is the website.
[01:03:55.390 --> 01:04:00.578]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:00.979 --> 01:04:08.592]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:09.306 --> 01:04:16.349]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:16.769 --> 01:04:28.194]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.494 --> 01:04:31.916]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:32.456 --> 01:04:34.397]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:34.717 --> 01:04:38.559]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.020]  I think so.
[01:06:26.195 --> 01:06:27.016]  We're good to go.
[01:06:53.095 --> 01:06:59.119]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:59.719 --> 01:07:02.781]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:04.762 --> 01:07:09.885]  Alright, we're going to go back to your calls here in a few minutes, but first I want to play part of this Glenn Beck piece from CNN and analyze it.
[01:07:09.925 --> 01:07:17.169]  And you definitely know Lou Dobbs, you definitely know Countdown with Keith Uberman.
[01:07:18.607 --> 01:07:23.769]  He gets up on the air and he talks about how Iran's going to nuke us and they snuck nukes across and we've got to attack them.
[01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:34.354]  But then he'll mix in the North American Union might not be a good idea and things like that I guess to keep some credibility because he's not stupid, you know, for the audiences.
[01:07:36.075 --> 01:07:38.776]  But listen to this piece very very clearly.
[01:07:39.216 --> 01:07:44.979]  You think he's attacking Bush and he is at a certain level but there's several points you'll probably pick up on
[01:07:45.876 --> 01:07:48.259]  That he's not really doing what he claims he's doing.
[01:07:48.619 --> 01:07:50.341]  Here's Glenn Beck, Friday Night CNN.
[01:08:05.539 --> 01:08:14.168]  And I hate to admit this, but I've got this growing feeling that our government is just not being honest with us anymore.
[01:08:14.648 --> 01:08:18.152]  Everywhere I turn, every level, I feel like I'm being lied to.
[01:08:18.172 --> 01:08:20.714]  That there's nobody in government that I can trust.
[01:08:22.356 --> 01:08:24.177]  I hope I'm alone in that.
[01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:26.721]  It's not just one issue.
[01:08:26.881 --> 01:08:27.982]  It's almost all of them.
[01:08:28.002 --> 01:08:30.305]  They're all starting to tie together for me.
[01:08:30.865 --> 01:08:34.069]  And I guess there's nothing that illustrates it better than the border issue.
[01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:43.159]  Like most people in America, I have been so outraged with what has been happening, or I guess, more appropriately, what's not been happening on the border.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.463]  With the immigration debate, it has been... it has been...
[01:08:47.265 --> 01:08:49.786]  Confusing, but that's not even enough.
[01:08:50.367 --> 01:08:53.308]  It has just never made any sense.
[01:08:53.648 --> 01:08:55.969]  Why are we selling out our own security?
[01:08:56.009 --> 01:08:59.231]  More importantly, who are we selling out to?
[01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:03.493]  Then yesterday, I had one of those Jerry Maguire moments.
[01:09:03.553 --> 01:09:06.754]  I woke up in the middle of the night, and it hit me all at once.
[01:09:06.834 --> 01:09:08.795]  Something that I had seen on television.
[01:09:09.295 --> 01:09:10.536]  The real story tonight?
[01:09:11.255 --> 01:09:16.597]  The real story is, the answer has been right in front of our eyes the entire time.
[01:09:16.937 --> 01:09:25.660]  But, it took a statement from the President in a press conference yesterday that I saw, on a completely unrelated issue, to bring it all together.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:26.960]  Listen to this.
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:29.381]  Let's put it this way.
[01:09:29.661 --> 01:09:35.843]  Money trumps peace, sometimes.
[01:09:35.863 --> 01:09:40.565]  In other words, commercial interests are very powerful interests.
[01:09:41.881 --> 01:09:42.553]  Throughout the world.
[01:09:43.906 --> 01:09:44.906]  Money trumps peace?
[01:09:45.206 --> 01:09:45.907]  Don't think so.
[01:09:46.427 --> 01:09:47.727]  Money trumps everything.
[01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:49.388]  It felt like that's what he wanted to say.
[01:09:49.728 --> 01:09:52.989]  You can't explain it any more clearer than the President just did!
[01:09:53.309 --> 01:10:00.711]  I want you to keep those words in mind as I tell you two unbelievable immigration stories that both make perfect sense to me now.
[01:10:01.392 --> 01:10:03.572]  First, we have that Bank of America story.
[01:10:03.932 --> 01:10:12.115]  The ad wizards over there have decided that illegal immigrants would make a nice niche market for a new credit card program.
[01:10:12.828 --> 01:10:14.950]  Gee, how do you reach that market?
[01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:19.295]  I mean, you can't exactly buy an undocumented worker email list, right?
[01:10:19.755 --> 01:10:19.996]  No.
[01:10:20.636 --> 01:10:21.918]  Turns out you don't have to.
[01:10:22.378 --> 01:10:28.525]  All you have to do is use one key phrase in your advertising that appeals most to that market.
[01:10:29.005 --> 01:10:29.586]  Ready for it?
[01:10:30.186 --> 01:10:32.709]  No social security number required.
[01:10:33.249 --> 01:10:38.294]  And that is exactly what the Bank of America is doing.
[01:10:38.574 --> 01:10:41.577]  Of course, now they're just claiming, oh, we're just trying to help.
[01:10:41.778 --> 01:10:42.618]  Let me give you this quote.
[01:10:43.199 --> 01:10:49.665]  These people, they're coming here for a quality of life and they deserve somebody to give them a chance to achieve that.
[01:10:50.286 --> 01:10:50.906]  Stop it!
[01:10:50.966 --> 01:10:52.228]  You're breaking my heart!
[01:10:52.668 --> 01:10:54.410]  But guess who made that heartfelt plea?
[01:10:54.990 --> 01:11:00.012]  It was the Bank of America's Director of Latin America Card Operations.
[01:11:00.533 --> 01:11:03.554]  Now, what do you suppose his interests are?
[01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:06.775]  The quality of life for the immigrants?
[01:11:07.156 --> 01:11:11.277]  Or squeezing every last drop of money out of the Hispanic market?
[01:11:11.818 --> 01:11:12.198]  Money.
[01:11:12.618 --> 01:11:13.078]  Trump's.
[01:11:13.458 --> 01:11:13.859]  Peace.
[01:11:14.319 --> 01:11:16.500]  And then, there's the story of the NFL.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.581]  This one is amazing!
[01:11:18.621 --> 01:11:21.363]  They actually refused to allow a U.S.
[01:11:21.483 --> 01:11:25.967]  Border Patrol recruitment ad in the NFL Super Bowl program.
[01:11:25.987 --> 01:11:26.567]  Look at the ad.
[01:11:26.607 --> 01:11:27.728]  This is what they wanted to run.
[01:11:27.748 --> 01:11:31.111]  It was going to be printed in their program this year, but no, no, no!
[01:11:31.171 --> 01:11:32.191]  The NFL turned it down!
[01:11:32.211 --> 01:11:33.172]  You ready for this?
[01:11:33.552 --> 01:11:37.355]  Quote, the immigration debate is a very controversial issue.
[01:11:37.996 --> 01:11:38.076]  Oh!
[01:11:38.576 --> 01:11:39.697]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:40.038 --> 01:11:51.110]  I guess that ad is controversial as well because it says that the Border Agents help stop terrorists, weapons, undocumented aliens, and drug smugglers from coming into this country.
[01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:52.571]  Oh, the humanity!
[01:11:53.092 --> 01:11:56.916]  The Border Patrol says the rejection is more than a little puzzling.
[01:11:57.663 --> 01:11:58.384]  No, it's not.
[01:11:58.884 --> 01:12:00.146]  Honestly, it's not.
[01:12:00.546 --> 01:12:08.534]  The real story is that in 2005, Mexico City was the first official NFL game site.
[01:12:08.954 --> 01:12:12.838]  The first game ever by the NFL to be played in Mexico was played in Mexico City.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.742]  Alright, so you hear that.
[01:12:16.802 --> 01:12:18.844]  They're covering it because they have to.
[01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:30.555]  He says that he gets the idea of the government's lying to us on almost everything, but he hopes he's the only person that thinks that.
[01:12:31.296 --> 01:12:34.478]  And the message there is it's not healthy to think that.
[01:12:34.878 --> 01:12:37.279]  It's not good to think that.
[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:51.008]  He then goes on to say that things make no sense, but then Bush says that powerful international financial interests trump everything.
[01:12:52.455 --> 01:13:00.153]  And then he claims that ad wizards at Bank of America came up with the term no social security number.
[01:13:00.353 --> 01:13:00.634]  No!
[01:13:02.299 --> 01:13:11.123]  The Associated Press reported last year what we told you over three years ago when Vicente Fox came to Austin, Texas and I bullhorned him and shut him down.
[01:13:11.703 --> 01:13:23.768]  He was here giving an award to the Austin Police Department for not arresting illegals for not having insurance or driver's license and accepting consular matriculus as driver's license.
[01:13:23.808 --> 01:13:24.328]  No law,
[01:13:25.114 --> 01:13:26.015]  Not a state law.
[01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:27.776]  For violating the law.
[01:13:27.816 --> 01:13:34.101]  Just deciding that they're God and they're going to let them play by different rules than everybody else.
[01:13:35.823 --> 01:13:37.884]  And he also gave an award that evening.
[01:13:37.904 --> 01:13:38.765]  He gave three.
[01:13:39.325 --> 01:13:42.308]  One of the other awards was to the legislature
[01:13:43.138 --> 01:13:51.002]  And the other, to a committee chairman, and the other award was to Wells Fargo that started all of this.
[01:13:51.082 --> 01:13:52.963]  And I learned of it three years ago.
[01:13:53.323 --> 01:13:55.665]  That means it had been going on for a while before that.
[01:13:56.585 --> 01:14:02.848]  And that is a debit card that they issue with no ID.
[01:14:04.429 --> 01:14:09.712]  In some cases they say they demand a console matricula that literally come in Cracker Jack boxes that anyone can get.
[01:14:11.036 --> 01:14:13.398]  To give them a debit card and bank account.
[01:14:13.418 --> 01:14:17.041]  And with that bank account number, they're able to get housing loans and car loans.
[01:14:18.462 --> 01:14:23.466]  And then the AP reported last year, the headline, 800 lenders.
[01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.412]  Reach out to the community.
[01:14:30.432 --> 01:14:36.118]  There was a similar headline out of the LA Times last week saying they're catering to the Hispanic market.
[01:14:36.458 --> 01:14:39.801]  Acting like it's all Hispanics are illegal aliens.
[01:14:39.881 --> 01:14:44.606]  No, it's to the illegal alien market and they said in the LA Times and in the AP last year
[01:14:45.874 --> 01:15:00.769]  LA Times last week, AP last year, and it had different bank chairmen saying, well there's a move to force them out of the country, there's a move to stop these people from coming here who are doing jobs no one wants and we want to help them put down roots so they can't be expelled.
[01:15:03.152 --> 01:15:12.119]  So this is corporate America in a concerted effort with the Democrats and Republicans to break down the sovereignty of this country.
[01:15:12.159 --> 01:15:25.929]  So Glenn Beck makes you think it's just the money and it's a business issue, and that's a fringe benefit of course, but he doesn't tell you it's part of the North American Union and under the guest worker program, which is total amnesty.
[01:15:26.989 --> 01:15:30.571]  That any illegals that are here will be instantly legalized for six years.
[01:15:31.011 --> 01:15:33.012]  Anyone who can get here will be legalized.
[01:15:33.312 --> 01:15:45.077]  It will allow them to bring almost unlimited members of their family here, and it allows corporations to bring in unlimited skilled and unskilled workers on open visa issuance.
[01:15:45.998 --> 01:15:48.459]  You think your high-tech jobs are gone now to India?
[01:15:49.099 --> 01:15:51.200]  Oh, just get ready, they'll just bring more here.
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.421]  So, this is the system.
[01:15:55.091 --> 01:15:58.815]  This is economic warfare, modern neo-mercantilism.
[01:16:00.617 --> 01:16:01.858]  This is not free market.
[01:16:02.038 --> 01:16:05.742]  This is monopoly capitalism with a fascist overlay.
[01:16:07.844 --> 01:16:11.428]  These are monopoly men operating against the people of the planet.
[01:16:11.508 --> 01:16:13.210]  Wendy in Texas, thank you for holding.
[01:16:16.574 --> 01:16:17.755]  Go ahead Wendy, you're on the air.
[01:16:20.458 --> 01:16:21.598]  Okay, let's let her go.
[01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:23.359]  Let's go on now and talk to Ted.
[01:16:23.379 --> 01:16:24.979]  Ted, where are you calling us from?
[01:16:25.579 --> 01:16:26.119]  Las Vegas.
[01:16:26.319 --> 01:16:26.679]  Welcome.
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:27.800]  Hey, Alex.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:28.920]  Hey, love your show.
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:33.541]  I'm sort of new to your program, you know, just the last couple months.
[01:16:34.121 --> 01:16:38.502]  I want to thank you for waking me up and all the great things that you're doing.
[01:16:39.022 --> 01:16:44.343]  I've decided to join this fight and got myself a DVD burner now.
[01:16:44.383 --> 01:16:48.104]  As soon as I figure out how to work it, I'm going to start burning copies of Terror Storm.
[01:16:48.766 --> 01:16:53.049]  Freedom to fascism, loose change, all those, you know, and start spreading them around.
[01:16:53.509 --> 01:17:00.655]  I like going out into the neighborhood and networking that and starting arguments with people and, you know, talking about these things and waking other people up.
[01:17:00.735 --> 01:17:01.855]  It's a lot of fun, actually.
[01:17:02.596 --> 01:17:06.519]  And it's sort of filled a void in my life, and I want to thank you for that.
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:08.100]  Very good.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.461]  I want to thank you for what you're doing.
[01:17:09.881 --> 01:17:10.502]  Yeah, it's great.
[01:17:11.042 --> 01:17:11.823]  It's a lot of fun.
[01:17:11.923 --> 01:17:12.523]  I just love it.
[01:17:13.564 --> 01:17:17.667]  Now, I have a little bit of a question you might want to expound on this a little bit, but
[01:17:18.295 --> 01:17:25.601]  I really, I get a little confused when I'm talking with people about the war in Iraq.
[01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:36.670]  So many people are always telling me, you know, that Bush has, you know, why did Congress allow Bush to go in there in the first place then?
[01:17:36.690 --> 01:17:42.675]  And I really get a little confused, you know, how this all came about when
[01:17:43.328 --> 01:17:48.570]  You know, he doesn't have, there is no declaration of war, he doesn't have any congressional authority to do what he's doing.
[01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:52.191]  There hasn't been a declaration of war since World War II ended in 1945.
[01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:58.833]  Not in Korea, not in Vietnam, not in Gulf War I or II, not in Bosnia, not in Serbia.
[01:17:59.653 --> 01:18:01.133]  Let me, let me just go over that.
[01:18:03.094 --> 01:18:09.976]  They gave an authorization to use force if the United States was quote threatened, so we claim they had WMDs and lied us into war.
[01:18:10.979 --> 01:18:16.942]  The Democrats, many of them, are just as neoconnish and bought off by foreign interest as Bush is.
[01:18:17.022 --> 01:18:21.824]  So, claiming that Congress allowed it so it's okay, number one, is wrong.
[01:18:22.705 --> 01:18:25.366]  And then, B, even if they did, it's a fraud.
[01:18:25.806 --> 01:18:28.487]  And the point is, we were lied into war.
[01:18:28.527 --> 01:18:30.789]  They promised the troops would be back by Christmas.
[01:18:30.829 --> 01:18:34.330]  Their own Pentagon plan said they planned to be there at least three decades.
[01:18:35.271 --> 01:18:39.533]  So, I don't know what the people need you're talking to.
[01:18:40.689 --> 01:18:43.172]  You know, if the people are stupid you're talking to, move on.
[01:18:43.993 --> 01:18:46.056]  Don't waste your time with them.
[01:18:46.116 --> 01:18:49.400]  Talk to people that have got ears to hear and eyes to see.
[01:18:50.001 --> 01:18:50.602]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:52.239 --> 01:18:57.203]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[01:19:24.327 --> 01:19:27.831]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:52.355]  Ted Anders for Midas.
[01:19:52.395 --> 01:19:52.735]  February 16, 2007.
[01:19:52.795 --> 01:19:52.996]  Gold 664.90.
[01:19:53.056 --> 01:19:55.938]  Ounce gold coins are at 686.35, 345.73 for half, 172.87 for quarter ounce.
[01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:56.419]  That's 686.35, 345.73, and 172.87.
[01:20:06.648 --> 01:20:08.510]  1971, Nixon closes the gold window.
[01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:09.390]  Fiat currency.
[01:20:10.171 --> 01:20:14.014]  1920s, the German market explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[01:20:14.335 --> 01:20:17.277]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[01:20:17.297 --> 01:20:20.119]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[01:20:20.139 --> 01:20:22.962]  1998, gold jumps 2 thirds over the Russian ruble.
[01:20:23.822 --> 01:20:26.545]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[01:20:26.785 --> 01:20:31.949]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[01:20:32.109 --> 01:20:33.410]  Could government let this happen?
[01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:35.472]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[01:20:35.692 --> 01:20:37.213]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[01:20:37.233 --> 01:20:42.097]  Did you know that an FBI agent assigned to the White House when Bill Clinton took office wrote a book entitled Unlimited Access?
[01:21:02.759 --> 01:21:10.125]  He told of Clinton's staff coming into the White House its first day with red buttons on their shirt with a picture of the first communist dictator, V.I.
[01:21:10.205 --> 01:21:10.866]  Lenin, on them.
[01:21:11.726 --> 01:21:16.430]  Is it any wonder the United States government moved further to the left during the Clinton administration?
[01:21:17.011 --> 01:21:21.014]  Even Hillary tried to pass a socialistic program for health care.

[01:22:59.157 --> 01:23:01.079]  In the build of big guns.
[01:23:03.501 --> 01:23:05.783]  In the build of death planes.
[01:23:07.739 --> 01:23:08.420]  Hi, welcome back.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:17.146]  You know, we should all not be so reliant on calculators, on computers.
[01:23:17.186 --> 01:23:23.171]  People 20, 30 years ago, most folks could do basic math.
[01:23:33.909 --> 01:23:36.950]  I learned basic math in school, but hardly remember it now and I need to use it.
[01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:37.790]  Here's an example.
[01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:40.330]  Atomic clocks go crazy sometimes.
[01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:45.691]  And when I came in here today, I didn't think and my atomic clock said the 15th.
[01:23:46.931 --> 01:23:50.272]  When I said it, I thought, that sounds weird, something's wrong, but I just moved on.
[01:23:50.292 --> 01:24:00.454]  And then I looked over, it was flashing, recalibrating, getting its radio signal, I guess, from NORAD in Denver, where they send out this global radio signal that programs these clocks.
[01:24:01.559 --> 01:24:05.862]  And in talk radio we all use these when it's syndicated because it's all coordinated with satellites.
[01:24:07.003 --> 01:24:09.344]  And it started blinking and it was the 19th.
[01:24:09.384 --> 01:24:10.745]  And I went, of course it's the 19th.
[01:24:11.426 --> 01:24:12.566]  But I said it was the 15th.
[01:24:14.268 --> 01:24:15.048]  Just incredible.
[01:24:16.269 --> 01:24:17.970]  That's the kind of mistakes I make.
[01:24:19.011 --> 01:24:20.772]  Let's go back to Wendy in Texas.
[01:24:20.792 --> 01:24:21.392]  She's there now.
[01:24:21.472 --> 01:24:22.233]  Wendy, go ahead.
[01:24:22.253 --> 01:24:23.614]  Hello, Alex.
[01:24:23.654 --> 01:24:24.515]  How are you doing?
[01:24:24.555 --> 01:24:24.855]  Good.
[01:24:24.895 --> 01:24:25.695]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:24:26.196 --> 01:24:26.476]  Yes.
[01:24:26.996 --> 01:24:29.518]  Listen, I woke up in October of last year.
[01:24:30.348 --> 01:24:36.653]  And as a woman, I have felt the backlash towards women for a long time.
[01:24:37.133 --> 01:24:58.728]  And personally, I'm very offended when people bring up Britney Spears or Anna Cole Smith in a negative way because I'm a woman and I just would like to challenge other women out there to take that opportunity when people start dissing women, you know, anybody, any woman, to just, you know, inform people that
[01:24:59.235 --> 01:25:07.041]  That's the global elite scum that are purposely doing that to break up the family and to put women in a bad light.
[01:25:07.141 --> 01:25:07.821]  Oh, I agree.
[01:25:08.241 --> 01:25:10.083]  But watch like Fox TV.
[01:25:10.203 --> 01:25:10.903]  It's the worst.
[01:25:11.143 --> 01:25:14.206]  Every male role model is a drunken idiot.
[01:25:14.326 --> 01:25:15.627]  The wife orders him around.
[01:25:15.707 --> 01:25:16.948]  He's a moron.
[01:25:17.268 --> 01:25:19.709]  So they attack both the husband and the wife.
[01:25:20.370 --> 01:25:25.073]  And yes, they do put out this image of how women are supposed to behave.
[01:25:25.093 --> 01:25:28.476]  So young women do act like that and they end up having very bad lives.
[01:25:29.555 --> 01:25:36.202]  And of course, notice it's the modern feminist movement that's telling women to act like this when really it degrades and destroys women.
[01:25:37.023 --> 01:25:37.684]  Absolutely.
[01:25:38.294 --> 01:25:39.435]  I love your show, Alex.
[01:25:39.515 --> 01:25:50.760]  I just wanted to challenge other women out there to stand up and to take that opportunity to shed some light on the global elite that are covering up the real issues.
[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:52.001]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:25:52.121 --> 01:25:53.042]  Thank you for the call.
[01:25:53.182 --> 01:26:00.245]  It's so many women that are on the front lines fighting the New World Order, whether it's on the cancer vaccines or the live cancer viruses or 9-11.
[01:26:02.094 --> 01:26:05.635]  I mean, you name it, fighting for our sovereignty, it's just women.
[01:26:06.016 --> 01:26:11.218]  And more men need to stand up and watch a few less ball games and be real men and stand up for their country.
[01:26:11.518 --> 01:26:12.438]  Well, they're like, I do!
[01:26:12.538 --> 01:26:13.499]  I'm for the war!
[01:26:13.939 --> 01:26:15.199]  That's what a man does!
[01:26:15.559 --> 01:26:18.621]  No, that war is meant to destroy the U.S.
[01:26:19.441 --> 01:26:22.802]  position in the world and demonize us, and it's worked quite well.
[01:26:23.022 --> 01:26:24.983]  And it's a total scam.
[01:26:25.663 --> 01:26:29.505]  A man should also be sophisticated enough to not always be scammed.
[01:26:30.727 --> 01:26:34.230]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in San Diego.
[01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:35.430]  You're on the air.
[01:26:35.470 --> 01:26:35.811]  Welcome.
[01:26:36.211 --> 01:26:37.492]  Hey, welcome, Alex.
[01:26:38.232 --> 01:26:42.555]  Every time I hear your digressions, that inspires me.
[01:26:42.955 --> 01:26:44.256]  Keep doing your digressions.
[01:26:45.057 --> 01:26:46.858]  Your great personality comes through there.
[01:26:47.178 --> 01:26:48.679]  By that, digressions, what do you mean?
[01:26:48.799 --> 01:26:50.000]  You go into your stories.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:54.743]  You start to make connections between other things.
[01:26:54.983 --> 01:26:57.224]  Not only the political, but you get into
[01:26:58.675 --> 01:27:09.828]  I think it's some of the funny comedy routines like the time you talked about the people that enjoy football and they think that their wife is like a blow-up doll.
[01:27:09.848 --> 01:27:12.611]  A few months back you were talking about that.
[01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:20.734]  It's a prosthesis, but it's not even a prosthesis that works.
[01:27:20.814 --> 01:27:25.577]  It's like a false limb, like a false leg, or arm, or hand, or eye.
[01:27:25.637 --> 01:27:26.638]  It doesn't really see.
[01:27:26.978 --> 01:27:30.200]  It's like it's a facsimile of ritualized warfare.
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:32.722]  It's a gladiatorial diversion.
[01:27:32.762 --> 01:27:34.103]  It's like the Great Coliseum.
[01:27:34.483 --> 01:27:35.644]  And so men aren't men.
[01:27:35.684 --> 01:27:36.905]  They have this instinct to fight.
[01:27:36.985 --> 01:27:40.628]  That instinct's there to fight for your tribe, your people, to stand up against oppression.
[01:27:40.968 --> 01:27:45.451]  Instead, men then put their manliness, not into just playing sports, that's fine.
[01:27:46.031 --> 01:27:53.016]  But actually just cheering and getting real serious, you know, taking it like it's a tribal war for the future of their tribe.
[01:27:53.036 --> 01:28:00.261]  And so again, they're taking your real energies and squandering them into a facsimile.
[01:28:00.602 --> 01:28:06.866]  So I said that's the equivalent to telling a man, hey, you're not really married, that's a blow-up doll.
[01:28:07.346 --> 01:28:08.707]  Well, it's the same thing with sports.
[01:28:08.787 --> 01:28:13.251]  No, you're not really a warrior, that's not really what your instincts are meant to be directed into.
[01:28:13.271 --> 01:28:13.751]  Do you understand?
[01:28:14.444 --> 01:28:15.584]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:28:15.604 --> 01:28:25.607]  Well, I just wanted to continue on the artistic path, and you have David Lynch on, and Richard Linklater, Vidal, Gore Vidal.
[01:28:26.268 --> 01:28:30.569]  Inspires me to listen to them, and that, as Lynch said, turn on the light.
[01:28:31.049 --> 01:28:35.650]  Let's talk about the great artistic spirit of the human condition.
[01:28:35.690 --> 01:28:37.491]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:28:37.511 --> 01:28:38.131]  We're about to break.
[01:28:38.897 --> 01:28:39.237]  That's it.
[01:28:39.277 --> 01:28:40.658]  You just remind me of William Shatner.
[01:28:41.018 --> 01:28:41.378]  Thank you.
[01:28:41.398 --> 01:28:41.958]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:42.078 --> 01:28:42.999]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.479 --> 01:28:45.060]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:48.761]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.223 --> 01:28:53.883]  Shelley, you look ex... Oh, wait.
[01:28:53.903 --> 01:28:55.064]  Why did you turn that down?
[01:28:55.523 --> 01:28:57.704]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[01:28:58.184 --> 01:29:02.646]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[01:29:02.786 --> 01:29:05.206]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[01:29:05.467 --> 01:29:06.627]  I can do something like that.
[01:29:06.747 --> 01:29:09.048]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[01:29:09.188 --> 01:29:12.029]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[01:29:12.089 --> 01:29:13.890]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:16.210]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[01:29:16.591 --> 01:29:17.211]  I guess you're right.
[01:29:17.591 --> 01:29:18.271]  Why don't we try it?
[01:29:18.431 --> 01:29:20.372]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[01:29:20.792 --> 01:29:25.155]  Yeah, just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[01:29:25.455 --> 01:29:26.796]  I know where we can get some more information.
[01:29:27.176 --> 01:29:31.479]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[01:29:31.719 --> 01:29:34.961]  The BedFan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.

[01:29:39.784 --> 01:29:41.025]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[01:29:41.225 --> 01:29:42.506]  The BedFan is the answer.
[01:29:42.766 --> 01:29:46.068]  Visit us today at www.bedfan.com.
[01:29:46.348 --> 01:29:48.950]  That's www.bedfan.com.
[01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:51.452]  That's EdFan.com.
[01:29:52.413 --> 01:29:56.356]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:29:56.596 --> 01:30:00.139]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:30:00.419 --> 01:30:04.502]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:30:04.782 --> 01:30:05.723]  I was so amazed.
[01:30:05.963 --> 01:30:08.786]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[01:30:08.986 --> 01:30:10.887]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:30:11.248 --> 01:30:16.452]  SoliWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:30:16.912 --> 01:30:22.834]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[01:30:23.094 --> 01:30:24.815]  I figured it would clean really well.
[01:30:25.075 --> 01:30:28.257]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:30:28.437 --> 01:30:32.338]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[01:30:32.638 --> 01:30:34.099]  Plus, the service was great.
[01:30:34.419 --> 01:30:39.081]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit soleilwellness.com.

[01:30:52.088 --> 01:30:56.131]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:56.331 --> 01:30:59.753]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:30:59.913 --> 01:31:03.435]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:31:03.655 --> 01:31:06.917]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:06.937 --> 01:31:12.401]  This basic candidate of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:31:12.441 --> 01:31:17.584]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal form it's like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[01:31:18.004 --> 01:31:18.684]  Thank you!

[01:31:41.757 --> 01:31:43.537]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:46.418]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:08.007 --> 01:32:08.948]  until 2 p.m.

[01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:12.851]  Back from 9 to midnight.

[01:32:14.953 --> 01:32:25.722]  But you can go to infowars.com and you can click on the podcast link there on the right hand side and subscribe for free.
[01:32:25.782 --> 01:32:27.383]  There's two different types of podcasts.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.882]  In one version and in another podcast.
[01:32:31.162 --> 01:32:34.565]  One podcast is just a few of the key interviews every week served up to you.
[01:32:35.025 --> 01:32:49.117]  The other is the full three hours every single day right at the end of the show it serves out in that next hour to literally tens upon tens of thousands of people.
[01:32:50.317 --> 01:32:54.321]  We get like 10,000 new subscribers each month and that just piles on top of all the others.
[01:32:54.581 --> 01:32:55.682]  It's getting pretty ridiculous.
[01:32:56.917 --> 01:32:57.318]  What did they say?
[01:32:57.338 --> 01:33:01.402]  We're using something like terabytes or something even bigger every week or something?
[01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:06.207]  It's expensive, but that's the kind of money I love to pay.
[01:33:06.227 --> 01:33:09.191]  To know that we're reaching all those people.
[01:33:10.024 --> 01:33:12.225]  And it's a great way to archive it, too.
[01:33:12.265 --> 01:33:21.770]  So what you do is you just download, you just go subscribe, and then every day it downloads to your computer, to your iPod, to your MP3 player, at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:22.531 --> 01:33:23.791]  And tell everybody about that.
[01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:30.955]  Go on the MySpace accounts, go on the message boards, email your email list, go on your Yahoo groups, and tell them, hey, there's the Alex Jones Podcast.
[01:33:31.867 --> 01:33:36.513]  And you can then again download it to your devices and share it and pass it around.
[01:33:37.033 --> 01:33:47.285]  So when you're on the exercise bike or you're running or you're jogging or you're on a road trip or when you're at work at lunch, you can walk away from your computer and you can do what you want.
[01:33:48.186 --> 01:33:48.927]  You can go to lunch.
[01:33:49.585 --> 01:33:53.407]  And you can, you know, any key programs you like, you can save and keep.
[01:33:54.347 --> 01:33:55.268]  So we're paying for it.
[01:33:55.368 --> 01:33:56.228]  I hope you use it.
[01:33:56.288 --> 01:33:57.128]  You are using it.
[01:33:57.549 --> 01:33:58.409]  Free podcast.
[01:33:58.429 --> 01:33:59.910]  We also re-stream the show.
[01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:01.570]  We provide our own streams.
[01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:02.951]  Genesis provides streams as well.
[01:34:03.311 --> 01:34:06.573]  But if you go to InfoWars.com, we provide a bunch of streams.
[01:34:06.653 --> 01:34:08.894]  Tens of thousands of people tune in every hour.
[01:34:09.714 --> 01:34:30.992]  Very exciting and just one of our streams is now number one on the shoutcast every day There's a whole bunch of other streams that are provided by the network and others But you can go there and every day when the show ends we just restream the three hours over and over again for you Doing everything we can to intensify the battle against the New World Order
[01:34:32.319 --> 01:34:39.525]  Also, don't forget, you support us by purchasing documentary films and books, and not just the books and videos that we produce, but the other books and videos we carry.
[01:34:39.545 --> 01:34:40.486]  You end up supporting us.
[01:34:40.967 --> 01:34:54.959]  And people like Dylan Avery, when you get Loose Change 2nd Edition from us, or 9-11, Mysteries, Demolitions, or America, Freedom to Fascism, and so many other 9-11 films, films about the New World Order, films about the Occult Elite, my new film, The Order of Death.
[01:34:55.219 --> 01:34:59.282]  When you get it, you get The Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove for free on the same DVD.
[01:35:00.719 --> 01:35:02.000]  That's the type of deals we've got.
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:04.521]  Some of my films are as low as $5.95 a piece.
[01:35:04.981 --> 01:35:05.981]  You can get Terror Storm for $9.95.
[01:35:06.882 --> 01:35:08.382]  We've got discounts on everything.

[01:35:14.025 --> 01:35:18.287]  And we take the profits from that, so we can operate like a normal company.
[01:35:21.858 --> 01:35:26.701]  And literally, we've done the math, 90 plus percent goes right back into paying for servers.
[01:35:27.081 --> 01:35:32.805]  I'm upgrading the prisonplanet.tv servers and adding those into load balance arrays in multiple parts of the country.
[01:35:33.706 --> 01:35:40.030]  Bigger servers for the streaming to accompany the increased traffic.
[01:35:40.795 --> 01:35:47.101]  We're about to redesign all the sites, launch a new huge mega-site that's going to have audio, video, portals.
[01:35:47.682 --> 01:35:48.382]  I'll just let you know.
[01:35:48.542 --> 01:35:49.063]  Dating.
[01:35:49.603 --> 01:35:51.025]  Patriots need to know how to get together.
[01:35:51.185 --> 01:35:54.027]  It's going to have message boards, your own websites, MySpace.
[01:35:54.968 --> 01:35:56.269]  I mean, I'm hiring four people.
[01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:57.250]  I got a new office.
[01:35:57.330 --> 01:35:58.932]  I mean, this thing's going to take months to develop.
[01:35:59.012 --> 01:35:59.833]  It's going to be big.
[01:35:59.853 --> 01:36:00.453]  You just watch.
[01:36:00.774 --> 01:36:02.135]  Alright, cats out of the bag on that.
[01:36:04.352 --> 01:36:10.917]  I've been mentioning I had some big thing I was developing and some delusionals locally thought it was something else, so I might as well just say what it is.
[01:36:11.878 --> 01:36:18.543]  No, I'm not worried about your microscopic pea shooters there in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:36:19.604 --> 01:36:20.685]  So many delusional people.
[01:36:21.946 --> 01:36:24.087]  I play songs on the air and people think it's for them.
[01:36:24.107 --> 01:36:24.828]  It's just amazing.
[01:36:25.088 --> 01:36:26.789]  Alright, I'm already digressing.
[01:36:26.829 --> 01:36:27.849]  I've got tons of news here.
[01:36:27.869 --> 01:36:28.810]  Dylan Avery's on hold.
[01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:30.811]  Dylan, you're on every week now!
[01:36:30.831 --> 01:36:31.531]  I love it!
[01:36:32.331 --> 01:36:36.293]  Don't get to see you in person that often like I'd like to, you and the crew, but it's good to have you on.
[01:36:36.614 --> 01:36:43.037]  You had a chance, obviously, to see the 9-11 conspiracies BBC primetime hit piece.
[01:36:43.597 --> 01:36:45.298]  I think you did a pretty darn good job.
[01:36:45.898 --> 01:36:50.901]  And you're here to give us your analysis on that before the creature himself,
[01:36:51.767 --> 01:36:58.418]  The hit piece captain of his crew joins us in the next hour from the bowels of the British broadcasting commissariat.
[01:36:58.458 --> 01:36:58.818]  Go ahead.
[01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:03.546]  Well yeah Alex, it's always great to be on your show and you're right, I'm getting on here more and more frequently.
[01:37:04.459 --> 01:37:09.261]  I was actually kind of hoping I could stay on the air for the Guy Smith stuff, even if you want to lead the way, that'd be great.
[01:37:09.301 --> 01:37:11.902]  Yeah, I just want to give him fair time.
[01:37:11.922 --> 01:37:14.483]  They put 11 people against 3 of us in the film.
[01:37:14.503 --> 01:37:16.284]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying about fairness, man.
[01:37:16.324 --> 01:37:18.025]  I feel you and me against Tim's pretty fair.
[01:37:18.345 --> 01:37:20.766]  But regardless, they got a lot of things wrong in that piece.
[01:37:20.886 --> 01:37:22.166]  I'm going to have Watson on too.
[01:37:23.287 --> 01:37:24.487]  Cool.
[01:37:24.707 --> 01:37:28.809]  I just want to give him equal time, so we'll give him like 2 minutes and each of you can have a minute or something like that.
[01:37:30.630 --> 01:37:38.819]  I mean I guess he did have four to one against us so we could have three to one on him but I just don't want I want to give him time to run but go ahead.
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:42.763]  Well you know basically there's a couple of blaring inaccuracies in their piece.
[01:37:43.463 --> 01:37:45.085]  The first one is that they make it seem like
[01:37:45.652 --> 01:37:49.297]  Uh, you know, hey, Dylan Avery feels that he has found the solution to where the people are.
[01:37:49.317 --> 01:37:50.278]  You know, I love how they say that.
[01:37:50.298 --> 01:37:52.741]  They take one piece of the movie and they say that I'm saying it's definitive.
[01:37:53.262 --> 01:38:01.893]  Uh, they act as if we never mentioned Delta 1989 and they even interview a passenger and show her ticket stub as if we're somehow denying that this woman took the flight.
[01:38:02.293 --> 01:38:03.995]  No, we don't deny Delta 1989 exists.
[01:38:04.035 --> 01:38:04.795]  You've got to stop.
[01:38:04.976 --> 01:38:13.843]  Not everybody out there is a grand poobah who, you know, has a master's degree in 9-11, who constantly studies it, eats, breathes, and sleeps it.
[01:38:14.244 --> 01:38:16.185]  Let's go back and explain this specifically.
[01:38:17.346 --> 01:38:17.947]  Sure.
[01:38:18.227 --> 01:38:25.033]  Well, to make a long story short, there's some research out there that was originally done by a man that goes by the nickname Woody Box.
[01:38:25.752 --> 01:38:35.837]  Uh, which basically details the fact that there were two very significantly different stories surrounding, uh, allegedly two planes that landed at Cleveland Hopkins Airport on the morning of 9-11.
[01:38:35.917 --> 01:38:37.957]  One of them was originally reported to be Flight 93.
[01:38:38.338 --> 01:38:41.659]  And as the days went on, the details about that plane changed and changed and changed.
[01:38:41.999 --> 01:38:44.921]  But, I mean, if you look at it, there's two different stories.
[01:38:44.961 --> 01:38:47.982]  It's not like the story changed multiple times and times were changing constantly.
[01:38:48.022 --> 01:38:50.043]  There were two separate planes that were being mentioned.
[01:38:50.063 --> 01:38:52.564]  Now, again, we're not saying that this is proof of anything.
[01:38:52.624 --> 01:38:54.545]  It's, uh, you know, it's what we did in the second edition.
[01:38:54.565 --> 01:38:55.065]  We brought up
[01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:57.391]  Now I want to get into the biggest thing.
[01:38:57.411 --> 01:38:58.151]  In fact, we have this clip.
[01:39:18.670 --> 01:39:21.512]  I gave the network the time codes this morning.
[01:39:21.532 --> 01:39:24.413]  I am them, but then I forgot which time code is which.
[01:39:24.854 --> 01:39:35.460]  Is it 30 minutes in, Dylan, where they get into claiming that the debris fill was only a mile away, and then falsely claim that, without giving sources, that
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:43.405]  That it was 8 miles or 6.9 by road and that the debris field was only a mile and that was paper.
[01:39:43.765 --> 01:39:51.449]  When we have the Cincinnati papers, the Associated Press and others saying 8 miles and big pieces of wreckage 8 miles away.
[01:39:51.469 --> 01:39:52.630]  Let me just ask the network.
[01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:53.971]  We're doing so much here folks.
[01:39:53.991 --> 01:39:56.212]  Sorry we gotta discuss stuff here on air.
[01:39:56.933 --> 01:40:00.615]  John, is it 30 minutes in that's got the stuff about Flight 93?
[01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:07.538]  Yeah, let's play a few minutes of this because the big thing here is...
[01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:31.134]  He confronted me about this and I pulled out news articles because I knew he was going to want to cover this and I then took him to a computer and showed him like three more, so five mainstream articles with police, state police, others saying that debris was upwards of eight miles away and then they claim that we're basically lying and that it was only one mile away.
[01:40:31.554 --> 01:40:34.695]  They do that on a very tenuous basis but here's a clip from the film.
[01:40:37.805 --> 01:40:49.008]  The theory that President Bush would not blanch about killing thousands of innocent Americans in collateral damage to launch this war of global domination is entirely plausible to the conspiracy theorists.
[01:40:50.009 --> 01:40:51.469]  We've invaded two sovereign nations.
[01:40:51.489 --> 01:40:52.989]  We're probably about to invade a third.
[01:40:53.169 --> 01:40:54.570]  Look at all the laws they've passed.
[01:40:54.690 --> 01:40:55.930]  Look at all the things they've done.
[01:40:56.090 --> 01:40:57.431]  They're spying on their own citizens.
[01:40:57.471 --> 01:41:00.452]  They can torture innocent civilians and call them enemy combatants.
[01:41:01.012 --> 01:41:04.213]  You know, you really have to ask yourself, would we be where we are right now without 9-11?
[01:41:06.118 --> 01:41:12.027]  For the 9-11 Truth Movement, the fate of the fourth hijacked plane is clear evidence of a government cover-up.
[01:41:12.948 --> 01:41:15.932]  There were 44 people on board United Flight 93.
[01:41:17.695 --> 01:41:22.061]  According to the official account, the passengers tried to seize back control of the aircraft.
[01:41:22.731 --> 01:41:28.217]  But as they fought their way into the cockpit, the hijackers crashed the plane in rural Pennsylvania.
[01:41:28.617 --> 01:41:31.580]  It's claimed that the plane was secretly shot down by the U.S.
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:32.141]  Air Force.
[01:41:46.758 --> 01:41:56.062]  Reports of debris being found miles from the crash site here proves, it's argued, that the Boeing started to disintegrate in mid-air after being hit by a missile.
[01:41:57.362 --> 01:42:04.685]  United 93 is just another one of the blaring cases of where we know the government story is a fraud.
[01:42:05.305 --> 01:42:09.887]  When planes crash into the ground, they never leave more than a mile long
[01:42:10.928 --> 01:42:16.612]  Debris field and you see the luggage and the engines and there's a huge wound in the ground.
[01:42:17.932 --> 01:42:27.358]  The state police, the feds are on record reporting that there was an eight plus mile debris field with flight 93.
[01:42:29.039 --> 01:42:33.702]  Five years on, alone stars and stripes marked the spot where United 93 came down.
[01:42:37.577 --> 01:42:39.879]  And this is where it was reported that wreckage was found.
[01:42:40.519 --> 01:42:42.641]  There was talk of parts of a wing and an engine.
[01:42:43.762 --> 01:42:48.565]  If debris had been recovered here, it would provide strong evidence to support the conspiracy theory.
[01:42:48.926 --> 01:42:53.229]  Because, it's claimed, Indian Lake is nearly 7 miles from the crash site.
[01:42:54.230 --> 01:43:02.596]  Journalists and 9-11 investigators have come up with the distance by typing the two locations into search engines and used the result in their articles.
[01:43:02.616 --> 01:43:03.617]  6.9 miles.
[01:43:11.281 --> 01:43:12.502]  It does seem to check out.
[01:43:14.023 --> 01:43:15.704]  But the road goes a long way around.
[01:43:16.725 --> 01:43:20.548]  In a straight line, Indian Lake is just over a mile from the crash site.
[01:43:21.529 --> 01:43:24.471]  And the wind was blowing in that direction on September the 11th.
[01:43:26.292 --> 01:43:27.873]  But was wreckage found here?
[01:43:27.893 --> 01:43:28.834]  Okay.
[01:43:30.475 --> 01:43:33.558]  Don't go too fast or we won't get too cold.
[01:43:34.358 --> 01:43:39.042]  Local residents heard the crash and soon after watched debris come down on the lake.
[01:43:41.283 --> 01:43:42.724]  Debris was floating through the air.
[01:43:43.005 --> 01:43:44.346]  This is what we found on the ground.
[01:43:44.546 --> 01:43:45.527]  Pieces similar to this.
[01:43:46.348 --> 01:43:49.270]  Nothing of any size, but just a lot of small pieces.
[01:43:50.211 --> 01:43:52.493]  And no large parts of an engine or a wing?
[01:43:52.513 --> 01:43:52.713]  No.
[01:43:52.773 --> 01:43:53.234]  Not at all.
[01:43:53.374 --> 01:43:53.534]  Okay.
[01:43:53.554 --> 01:43:54.515]  We have nothing of it.
[01:43:55.183 --> 01:44:11.603]  Alright, and Dylan, you want to comment on this because we have the police saying big pieces of wreckage four and a half miles away, other reports saying papers eight miles away, and that's in the newspaper articles, but they don't want to talk about those, do they?
[01:44:12.124 --> 01:44:13.085]  Do they, Dylan Avery?
[01:44:13.595 --> 01:44:22.722]  Well, no, and the other thing they didn't want to talk about is New Baltimore, which, as far as I know, is actually 8 miles away, and singed paper from the crash was found there, among many other things.
[01:44:23.062 --> 01:44:26.825]  And again, we have the mainstream news articles on that saying that.
[01:44:26.865 --> 01:44:27.826]  That's why we reported that.
[01:44:28.546 --> 01:44:30.448]  Yeah, 8 miles away, New Baltimore.
[01:44:30.488 --> 01:44:37.473]  Melanie Hankinson said she found singed papers and other light debris from the crash, including pages from Hemispheres Magazine, United In-Flight Magazine.
[01:44:39.272 --> 01:44:42.596]  Uh, so yeah, they uh, see how there's a lot of things they didn't mention in this piece, and New Baltimore was just one of them.
[01:44:55.859 --> 01:45:01.762]  Have you saying, hey, they find engines, well, and then they show the hole and an engine in it.
[01:45:02.082 --> 01:45:05.523]  But the point is, that's all that's in the hole is an engine.
[01:45:05.563 --> 01:45:06.784]  There isn't any other parts.
[01:45:06.824 --> 01:45:08.825]  The point, of course, an engine made a big hole.
[01:45:09.285 --> 01:45:13.366]  That's what we're saying is that some of the debris fell where they are now putting the memorial.
[01:45:13.827 --> 01:45:16.888]  Large portions of the debris fell there, but there was debris scattered.
[01:45:17.608 --> 01:45:21.670]  According to mainstream press reports, for over eight miles.
[01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:28.012]  Then expanding out from there, they then claim, oh look, a passport of one of the hijackers was found.
[01:45:28.593 --> 01:45:29.653]  Oh, how convenient.
[01:45:29.713 --> 01:45:31.394]  And they even showed the bandana!
[01:45:31.614 --> 01:45:32.834]  They showed the bandana!
[01:45:33.055 --> 01:45:33.935]  I mean, come on!
[01:45:35.803 --> 01:45:41.165]  An unburned red bandana saying it probably came from one of the hijackers.
[01:45:41.205 --> 01:45:47.948]  Now, when we do our debunking piece, and we've already done several, but we're going to do more on the debunking of the debunking.
[01:45:49.261 --> 01:45:49.941]  Let's be clear.
[01:45:50.021 --> 01:46:01.924]  They claim that not one, but two passports went out of their luggage, out of their clothes, out of the side of the fireball, out of the building, and were found unburned on the street.
[01:46:02.124 --> 01:46:09.686]  And then, when it turned out that one of the passports was to a wrong person still living in Saudi Arabia, and by the way, that was the BBC reporting that,
[01:46:10.086 --> 01:46:13.407]  They then retracted that and said we were wrong, we didn't find passports.
[01:46:13.707 --> 01:46:16.648]  I mean, how obvious is this planting of passports getting?
[01:46:16.848 --> 01:46:21.530]  It's like the 7-7 bombing, Dylan, where they planted one guy's ID card at two different bomb sites.
[01:46:23.090 --> 01:46:23.790]  Hmm, exactly.
[01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:24.291]  How do we know?
[01:46:25.751 --> 01:46:27.151]  I mean, how ridiculous is this?
[01:46:27.231 --> 01:46:28.892]  Now there's unburned bandanas?
[01:46:30.052 --> 01:46:31.813]  Yeah, and they even showed one of the box cutters, too.
[01:46:33.277 --> 01:46:38.561]  Yeah, they got box cutters survived, but we don't see any debris at the site, just a hole.
[01:46:39.162 --> 01:46:40.463]  They've got all this stuff.
[01:46:40.643 --> 01:46:41.564]  Boy, this is amazing.
[01:46:41.884 --> 01:46:47.889]  And they also now claim the coroner, and you just quoted his quotes, and then he says, well that basically is out of context.
[01:46:47.929 --> 01:46:49.030]  But it isn't out of context.
[01:46:49.410 --> 01:46:51.832]  The coroners and others said we didn't find any bodies.
[01:46:52.753 --> 01:46:56.076]  And they said the same thing at the Pentagon, and now he's going back on that.
[01:46:56.116 --> 01:46:57.417]  You want to break that down?
[01:46:58.359 --> 01:47:07.133]  Well yeah, you know, the whole Wally Miller thing is really interesting because people to this day, and obviously the BBC did it, accuse us of taking those quotes out of context.
[01:47:07.634 --> 01:47:09.757]  No, we didn't take anything out of context.
[01:47:09.797 --> 01:47:12.442]  We put the quotes up on the screen and read what he said.
[01:47:12.876 --> 01:47:13.176]  Okay.
[01:47:13.296 --> 01:47:16.839]  The fact is, he said those things four, five, maybe six different times.
[01:47:16.879 --> 01:47:19.742]  He reiterated himself on 9-11-2002.
[01:47:19.802 --> 01:47:21.523]  He said that I barely saw any bodies.
[01:47:21.904 --> 01:47:22.484]  It's true.
[01:47:22.744 --> 01:47:23.305]  He didn't.
[01:47:23.445 --> 01:47:26.868]  I mean, he's saying that, and we are quoting Wally Miller.
[01:47:26.928 --> 01:47:29.550]  And you read his whole quotes that he told the press!
[01:47:30.111 --> 01:47:33.874]  I mean, one time he told the press, oh, you know, it looked like there were no passengers on board.
[01:47:33.974 --> 01:47:36.296]  I mean, why is a coroner saying this at a plane crash?
[01:47:36.983 --> 01:47:44.965]  I mean, and he's like, well, he says, it looks like there were no passengers, I saw no bodies, it was just a hole in the ground, and then now, he looks scared.
[01:47:44.985 --> 01:47:46.965]  He's saying, no, no, no, no, you misunderstand me.
[01:47:47.505 --> 01:47:52.966]  Well, yeah, he's like, oh, well, what I meant by I stopped being a coroner after 20 minutes is that it was obvious it was a funeral service.
[01:47:53.326 --> 01:48:04.148]  We're not disagreeing with you, Wally, we're simply bringing up the fact that you said multiple times to the public, and again, a year after the fact, that you saw no bodies there and didn't see a drop of blood.
[01:48:04.409 --> 01:48:06.609]  Not a single drop of blood in a plane crash.
[01:48:07.122 --> 01:48:09.263]  I mean, let's think about this, people.
[01:48:09.744 --> 01:48:21.250]  But you know, again, it's Wally Miller, so... Then there's a lady that claims she took the picture of the big puff of smoke and that's been looked at.
[01:48:21.994 --> 01:48:33.645]  Yeah, but hey Alex, the other point that I thought was interesting is that they brought on the writer from the X-Files, but they didn't bring on Dean Haglund, who was in the Lone Gunman pilot, who went public on your show and called 9-11 an inside job.
[01:48:33.665 --> 01:48:35.187]  They don't interview that guy for some reason.
[01:48:35.347 --> 01:48:39.571]  Well, I remember they said we're going to interview the producer, the writer of the X-Files.
[01:48:42.774 --> 01:48:44.275]  And I said, why don't you interview Dean Hagelin?
[01:48:44.315 --> 01:48:50.900]  Here's videotapes of him saying he believes it's an inside job that the CIA would approach them and plant storylines on them.
[01:48:51.501 --> 01:49:03.390]  In the piece, a hijacked jet by remote control to be flown to the World Trade Center, a passenger jet, and the government uses a drill to smokescreen that so that they're able to beat the defenses.
[01:49:03.850 --> 01:49:04.811]  In this piece,
[01:49:05.171 --> 01:49:06.392]  Yes, I agree with you Alex.
[01:49:30.678 --> 01:49:31.419]  Stay there, Dylan.
[01:49:31.539 --> 01:49:41.272]  One more segment with you, then we're going to let you ride shotgun when we get Guy Smith from the bowels of the BBC from London, England, on air.
[01:49:41.852 --> 01:49:44.676]  The man behind this atrocity.
[01:49:45.357 --> 01:49:46.278]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:46.298 --> 01:49:46.819]  Stay with us.
[01:49:55.325 --> 01:50:00.792]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.153 --> 01:50:08.763]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.494 --> 01:50:16.538]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:16.938 --> 01:50:28.365]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.685 --> 01:50:32.187]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:32.627 --> 01:50:34.588]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:34.909 --> 01:50:38.751]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:11.238 --> 01:51:12.980]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:14.121]  Honey, cheer up!

[01:53:06.434 --> 01:53:08.595]  I want you to call Guy Smith in about three minutes.
[01:53:08.695 --> 01:53:14.878]  I want him for the full hour starting immediately when we start up the next hour in about six minutes.
[01:53:16.119 --> 01:53:25.704]  Bill and Avery will ride shotgun with us, so will Paul Watson, but I'm going to let them pop in with limited questions or comments because I've got a bunch of clips I want to play for Guy Smith and I want to go over things with him.
[01:53:26.585 --> 01:53:33.688]  Why do you interview Craig Bartmer, who we interviewed in New York, decorated police officer, who they said they were going to blow up Building 7 and get back?
[01:53:34.048 --> 01:53:34.929]  That's a police officer!
[01:53:35.754 --> 01:53:39.957]  And I've talked to countless ones who wouldn't go on video saying, oh my gosh, they should get back, they were going to blow it up.
[01:53:40.737 --> 01:53:43.339]  They didn't want to get into that, did they, my friend?
[01:53:43.779 --> 01:53:46.181]  No, Alex, Craig was there for the taping, man.
[01:53:46.221 --> 01:53:47.061]  That is the whole thing.
[01:53:47.442 --> 01:53:49.763]  Craig was visiting our house while Guy Smith was there.
[01:53:50.143 --> 01:53:52.905]  And after the taping, Craig caught him and the cameraman at the door.
[01:53:52.945 --> 01:53:57.668]  He's like, listen, man, you know, I just want to tell you, more or less, that you're full of you-know-what.
[01:53:57.929 --> 01:53:59.029]  You know, he's like, I was there, man.
[01:53:59.089 --> 01:54:00.710]  I melted five pairs of boots on a pile.
[01:54:00.770 --> 01:54:04.513]  I mean, he just reamed into him for like ten minutes, and Guy and his cameraman just walked away.
[01:54:05.219 --> 01:54:06.300]  They got a big problem, though.
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:12.348]  I mean, we were there last year at 9-11, and I was there two years before that, and like half the cops were on our side.
[01:54:12.649 --> 01:54:16.153]  This time it was like 70% of the cops, 99% of the firefighters.
[01:54:16.854 --> 01:54:21.040]  I mean, Dylan, literally, we couldn't hardly get our work done because they were all thanking us.
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.821]  I agree with you wholeheartedly.
[01:54:22.861 --> 01:54:25.462]  Another thing I want to bring up before we forget
[01:54:41.184 --> 01:54:42.947]  Uh, the 4,000 Jews thing.
[01:54:43.327 --> 01:54:48.634]  I mean, could there have been any lower blow to the 9-11 Truth Movement than the 4,000 Jews thing?
[01:54:48.674 --> 01:54:51.037]  None of us endorsed that!
[01:54:51.258 --> 01:54:55.824]  We never said that, and every time he brought it up to me, I'd say, here is the Jerusalem Post.
[01:54:56.164 --> 01:54:57.725]  Here is Harach.
[01:54:57.765 --> 01:55:04.728]  Here's Odigo, the head of the Israeli company in Tel Aviv, saying, we got a call saying get our people out hours before.
[01:55:05.108 --> 01:55:06.568]  That's where the rumor started.
[01:55:06.868 --> 01:55:08.589]  And they did indeed make the warning.
[01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:12.451]  There were Jews that died, but the Odigo employees got out or didn't go.
[01:55:12.651 --> 01:55:14.131]  But Guy Smith didn't want to touch that.
[01:55:14.151 --> 01:55:15.452]  No, he didn't.
[01:55:16.112 --> 01:55:19.513]  He wanted to take one ridiculous claim and he went into 10 minutes.
[01:55:19.594 --> 01:55:20.654]  I mean, he interviewed a woman
[01:55:21.649 --> 01:55:22.269]  Come on, man.
[01:55:22.409 --> 01:55:23.910]  I mean, it was such a hit piece.
[01:55:24.010 --> 01:55:26.471]  It got really obvious near the end, especially when they pulled that.
[01:55:28.052 --> 01:55:34.494]  And she's like, well, why didn't my family then not go to work if it wasn't... if the Jews didn't... Of course Jews died!
[01:55:35.694 --> 01:55:37.315]  One company warned its employees.
[01:55:37.355 --> 01:55:38.935]  Some other companies warned as well.
[01:55:39.456 --> 01:55:40.896]  Arabs weren't in the building that day.
[01:55:40.956 --> 01:55:42.217]  Everybody was talking about it.
[01:55:42.777 --> 01:55:45.278]  Yeah, we sympathize with her, man.
[01:55:45.378 --> 01:55:46.418]  I mean, we understand.
[01:55:46.498 --> 01:55:47.739]  It's tough that your brother's dead.
[01:55:47.779 --> 01:55:48.739]  We fully understand.
[01:55:49.201 --> 01:55:52.143]  We never said that your brother, like, didn't get a specific warning.
[01:55:52.463 --> 01:56:00.089]  Dylan, I know you're busy with the final cut, but I may have to do this with my local TV show and then put it on the web, but take short clips of BBC.
[01:56:00.849 --> 01:56:03.511]  We can't get away with doing more, but we can do it for fair use to analyze it.
[01:56:03.531 --> 01:56:04.692]  It is about us, after all.
[01:56:05.092 --> 01:56:11.877]  Take short clips of their claims, then lay out the facts after each piece, and then show what we really said, what we really did.
[01:56:13.058 --> 01:56:15.359]  But, I mean, I gave Guy Smith a huge folder of news articles.
[01:56:15.399 --> 01:56:16.280]  He didn't want any of it.
[01:56:18.641 --> 01:56:19.182]  Unbelievable.
[01:56:20.543 --> 01:56:23.626]  We got a minute or two left before Guy Smith is supposedly going to join us.
[01:56:24.047 --> 01:56:25.148]  Go ahead and add other points, Dylan.
[01:56:26.409 --> 01:56:27.010]  Let's see here.
[01:56:27.777 --> 01:56:30.258]  There's one thing I wanted to bring up, but I wanted to talk to him about it.
[01:56:31.058 --> 01:56:36.940]  The glaring issue, man, the overall problem, I think everyone's overall problem with the piece is it didn't talk about the real issues.
[01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:42.641]  It didn't talk about Norman Mineta, it didn't talk about the ISI connection, it didn't address the molten metal at all.
[01:56:42.941 --> 01:56:47.863]  There are so many legitimate issues that they could have rushed upon, and it's like they deliberately ignored them.
[01:56:48.163 --> 01:56:51.844]  In fact, as far as I remember, Stephen Jones was actually contacted for this.
[01:56:52.864 --> 01:56:55.105]  And, you know, for some reason he didn't appear in the program.
[01:56:57.173 --> 01:56:59.374]  Hey, they were here off and on for a week.
[01:56:59.474 --> 01:57:02.256]  I mean, it had to be over 20 hours of more than 20 hours of footage.
[01:57:03.276 --> 01:57:06.398]  The more I think about it, and I'm in there three minutes, Dylan.
[01:57:07.758 --> 01:57:10.279]  Yeah, we thought that you could have gotten a lot more screen time.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:12.200]  Well, it's not that I even care.
[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:17.883]  The point is, is that I was so focused with the facts and that they were getting frustrated.
[01:57:18.243 --> 01:57:19.204]  Well, we're going to talk to
[01:57:20.908 --> 01:57:25.269]  We're going to talk to the old serpent himself here on the other side of this break.
[01:57:25.289 --> 01:57:27.329]  Guy Schmidt, we appreciate his courage coming on.
[01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:28.650]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:31.851 --> 01:57:36.512]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:47.779 --> 01:57:48.420]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.081 --> 01:57:50.122]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:50.843 --> 01:57:52.004]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.625 --> 01:57:53.426]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.207 --> 01:57:55.068]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.088 --> 01:57:59.573]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:59.934 --> 01:58:04.018]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.305 --> 01:58:24.491]  In the Encyclopedia Britannica 1999 edition, if you turn to yellow journalism, it details William Randolph Hearst helping organize and stage propaganda for the Spanish-American War, the enactment of the Federal Reserve, and many other globalist imperial programs.
[01:58:25.611 --> 01:58:28.372]  There's only one other media group in history
[01:58:29.119 --> 01:58:32.520]  Known for being more associated with the government and propaganda.
[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:34.220]  That is, in history, still operating.
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:46.302]  George Orwell, of course, fashioning the character Winston off of himself in the Ministry of Truth, in a fictional nightmare future dystopia, fashioned the Ministry of Truth off of the BBC.
[01:58:47.322 --> 01:58:51.623]  We're black is white, up is down, left is right.
[01:58:52.343 --> 01:58:55.644]  And we are joined by Guy Smith, producer,
[01:58:56.531 --> 01:59:02.796]  Director who made the primetime Sunday program, 9-11 conspiracies for the BBC.
[01:59:02.836 --> 01:59:04.857]  He'll be with us for the entire hour.
[01:59:04.877 --> 01:59:11.962]  Dylan Avery will be popping in, as well as Paul Joseph Watson from Sheffield, England.
[01:59:13.103 --> 01:59:15.485]  Guy Smith, I appreciate you coming on.
[01:59:15.825 --> 01:59:16.786]  No, a pleasure, Alex.
[01:59:17.106 --> 01:59:22.670]  I don't know about yellow journalism, but I guess we just followed the evidence where it led us.
[01:59:23.789 --> 01:59:25.170]  Oh, I was speaking of Hearst Publishing.
[01:59:25.230 --> 01:59:26.111]  Certainly, you're a journalist.
[01:59:26.131 --> 01:59:27.392]  You know about Hearst Publishing, right?
[01:59:27.712 --> 01:59:28.232]  Certainly do.
[01:59:28.573 --> 01:59:36.619]  And Chertoff's cousin, the Homeland Security Director, telling me it wasn't a hit piece, and then it was.
[01:59:37.119 --> 01:59:39.561]  I was talking about a previous hit piece.
[01:59:40.081 --> 01:59:47.627]  Guy, you told me over the phone that it wasn't a hit piece, but you also laughed and said you don't believe the stuff we've put out.
[01:59:48.487 --> 01:59:52.428]  I mean, can you honestly say that this isn't an attempt at debunking?
[01:59:52.888 --> 02:00:03.091]  Yeah, Alex, I really appreciate coming on your show, and I admire much of the work you do in talking about subjects that perhaps the mainstream media doesn't want to talk about.
[02:00:03.632 --> 02:00:06.672]  But we didn't set out to do a hit piece, as you call it.
[02:00:07.073 --> 02:00:11.514]  What we did is that we set out to investigate the evidence and to see where it led us.
[02:00:12.288 --> 02:00:17.933]  And if it turned out that some of the conspiracy theories were true, I would have gladly said that in the film.
[02:00:18.294 --> 02:00:25.660]  You know, we're not acting on behalf of any government agency or, you know, we're not part of some conspiracy... The BBC isn't government funded?
[02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:27.582]  Is it funded and controlled by Tim Downing Street?
[02:00:28.182 --> 02:00:29.023]  No, it's not actually.
[02:00:29.403 --> 02:00:32.927]  The BBC is funded by the public through a license fee system.
[02:00:32.967 --> 02:00:34.108]  It's a complicated system.
[02:00:34.648 --> 02:00:40.171]  Which doesn't really operate, doesn't have any similarity to anything that operates in the States.
[02:00:40.211 --> 02:00:43.453]  But basically, people who have a television in Britain have to pay a tax.
[02:00:43.793 --> 02:00:47.255]  They pay that tax to the government and then the government hands it on to the BBC.
[02:00:47.535 --> 02:00:56.841]  And just two years ago they made the director of the BBC resign and apologizing for putting out pieces claiming that Blair knew about WMDs and other things.
[02:00:56.881 --> 02:00:59.242]  Now all totally admitted the BBC was right there.
[02:01:00.345 --> 02:01:02.386]  Well, I mean, that's a whole different story.
[02:01:03.006 --> 02:01:05.707]  But, you know, I can gladly talk about that if you like.
[02:01:05.727 --> 02:01:11.469]  But I guess the main thing is to talk about the program that we made last night and that you said the hit piece.
[02:01:11.529 --> 02:01:13.130]  And I'm saying it's not a hit piece.
[02:01:13.170 --> 02:01:16.291]  What it's doing is investigating the conspiracy theories.
[02:01:16.651 --> 02:01:20.032]  And we did that in an objective and a balanced way.
[02:01:20.152 --> 02:01:21.393]  And we followed the evidence.
[02:01:21.433 --> 02:01:22.473]  We followed the trail.
[02:01:22.933 --> 02:01:24.474]  And we've followed where the trail led us.
[02:01:24.534 --> 02:01:25.595]  A balanced way.
[02:01:25.635 --> 02:01:27.275]  You had eleven debunkers.
[02:01:27.656 --> 02:01:28.616]  We've timed it out.
[02:01:28.676 --> 02:01:32.878]  You gave them at least three times more time than you gave the three 9-11 truthers.
[02:01:35.111 --> 02:01:40.974]  Well, we talked to a lot of people on all sides of the debate.
[02:01:41.014 --> 02:01:44.655]  It was almost 4-1, the time you gave them.
[02:01:44.675 --> 02:01:46.636]  4-1, is that balanced?
[02:01:46.956 --> 02:01:56.300]  Yeah, but Alex, you know that you carry a lot more weight than any debunkers, and when you come on air, you have a lot more impact than anybody who's an expert or anything like that.
[02:01:57.461 --> 02:02:00.502]  Very condescending and sarcastic and complete.
[02:02:01.371 --> 02:02:01.832]  Please.
[02:02:02.872 --> 02:02:08.538]  You had your say in the film and you know many people will watch the program and they can make up their own minds.
[02:02:08.678 --> 02:02:09.839]  Why did you interview me?
[02:02:09.939 --> 02:02:12.481]  Why did you interview me for off and on for a week?
[02:02:12.762 --> 02:02:15.464]  I know that'd be over 20 hours of footage and I was in there three minutes.
[02:02:16.025 --> 02:02:17.486]  Well it wasn't actually a week.
[02:02:17.726 --> 02:02:21.269]  I mean we came to Dallas and we met you on the Saturday.
[02:02:21.590 --> 02:02:26.034]  You came to Dallas, interviewed me there, then you interviewed me in Austin in my studio, then the other studio.
[02:02:26.114 --> 02:02:27.255]  Off and on for a week you were here.
[02:02:27.355 --> 02:02:27.835]  No, it wasn't.
[02:02:27.855 --> 02:02:29.676]  It was over two days, actually.
[02:02:29.916 --> 02:02:32.258]  I mean, I can be absolutely quite certain about that.
[02:02:32.318 --> 02:02:35.780]  We interviewed you in Dallas and then we interviewed you the next day in Austin.
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:37.881]  Guy Smith, stay there.
[02:02:37.901 --> 02:02:41.603]  We're going to be right back on the other side of this break to walk through this.
[02:02:41.623 --> 02:02:43.144]  We appreciate your courage.
[02:02:46.664 --> 02:02:52.154]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:52.535 --> 02:03:00.128]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:00.856 --> 02:03:07.918]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:08.319 --> 02:03:19.762]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.042 --> 02:03:23.484]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:24.004 --> 02:03:25.924]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:26.265 --> 02:03:30.046]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:43.317 --> 02:03:48.398]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:48.458 --> 02:03:55.780]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:06.542]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:04:06.742 --> 02:04:11.323]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:11.583 --> 02:04:12.303]  Unbelievably,

[02:04:45.184 --> 02:04:49.326]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:04:49.546 --> 02:04:51.307]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:04:51.567 --> 02:04:57.850]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:04:58.150 --> 02:05:04.273]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:05:04.513 --> 02:05:06.354]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:05:06.634 --> 02:05:07.055]  I think so.
[02:05:29.216 --> 02:05:33.198]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:33.258 --> 02:05:37.280]  Guy Smith, producer, director for the BBC, put together a well-done visual piece, well-produced,
[02:05:59.893 --> 02:06:02.455]  Regardless, off and on for several days they interviewed me.
[02:06:02.916 --> 02:06:05.958]  I would imagine it had to be twenty-something hours of footage.
[02:06:07.499 --> 02:06:08.801]  So, let me just go back.
[02:06:09.241 --> 02:06:12.584]  Let's be conservative and say it's ten hours of footage.
[02:06:12.604 --> 02:06:16.307]  Why did you only use three minutes of me in there if it's so balanced?
[02:06:18.022 --> 02:06:22.888]  I hate to disagree with you that we interviewed you for 10 hours or 20 hours or over a week.
[02:06:23.729 --> 02:06:29.617]  We filmed an interview with you, you made some very cogent points and you're in the film.
[02:06:31.429 --> 02:06:32.249]  What's the complaint?
[02:06:32.289 --> 02:06:33.110]  Well, I mean, wait a minute.
[02:06:33.150 --> 02:06:45.353]  I mean, you interviewed me for like three hours at the Grassy Knoll, and you followed us around, and we're taping off and on during a five-hour event at night, and the next day you interviewed me, you videotaped the two-hour radio show, then you interviewed me about two hours after.
[02:06:45.373 --> 02:06:49.674]  I talked to you constantly on the phone for weeks before that, but let's not digress.
[02:06:49.694 --> 02:06:50.914]  There's a lot of points to make here.
[02:06:51.214 --> 02:06:58.836]  My point is, are you denying that you had eleven debunkers and three 9-11 truthers in the film, and are you denying that they had a lot more time than we did?
[02:07:00.619 --> 02:07:01.559]  No, I'm not denying that.
[02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:08.245]  We interviewed three main conspiracy theorists, you, Dylan Avery and Jim Fetzer.
[02:07:08.705 --> 02:07:16.652]  Your views represent many other people in America, I accept that, and likewise those of Dylan Avery and Jim Fetzer.
[02:07:16.972 --> 02:07:18.293]  And they had a good say in the program.
[02:07:20.615 --> 02:07:25.919]  We gave them a lot of attention and a lot of opportunity to voice their views in the program.
[02:07:26.319 --> 02:07:31.722]  And the program then went to investigate the claims that you and the other two guys are making.
[02:07:31.742 --> 02:07:33.644]  And that's what we did in the program.
[02:07:33.984 --> 02:07:41.509]  If it turned out that the trail that we followed led us to a different conclusion, we would have said that.
[02:07:42.009 --> 02:07:44.411]  All I can report is what we found out.
[02:07:45.191 --> 02:07:49.154]  In the end, people must make up their own views as to whether they want to believe us or they don't.
[02:07:49.714 --> 02:07:51.156]  I accept that too.
[02:07:51.396 --> 02:07:54.460]  I'm not trying to force this down anybody's throat.
[02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:59.026]  I'm not trying to force anybody to accept what we're saying.
[02:07:59.046 --> 02:08:00.748]  I'm just saying, look, this is what we did.
[02:08:01.950 --> 02:08:07.377]  Why didn't you have, say, Kevin Ryan of Underwriting Laboratories, their own internal report said that
[02:08:08.497 --> 02:08:12.559]  1,800 degree jet fuel couldn't melt steel that doesn't melt and it was molten.
[02:08:12.579 --> 02:08:13.280]  That's on record.
[02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:15.761]  We have the aerial photographs and the firefighters.
[02:08:15.781 --> 02:08:17.442]  It was molten four weeks later.
[02:08:17.962 --> 02:08:35.030]  How does 1,800 degrees melt steel that non-structural raw steel doesn't start melting till 2,554 degrees structural hardened steel until 3,300 and those are numbers people can just pull up instantly on any engineering website.
[02:08:35.550 --> 02:08:37.411]  Why didn't you guys include that in your film?
[02:08:38.371 --> 02:08:46.517]  Well, the reality is that we had 59 minutes and, frankly, we could have spent all day talking about just the Twin Towers.
[02:08:46.557 --> 02:08:59.487]  We covered a lot of ground in the program, everything from the hijackers arriving in America before the attacks through to how the government tried to, the CIA and the FBI, tried to cover up their mistakes after the attacks.
[02:08:59.987 --> 02:09:00.328]  Yes, we are.
[02:09:19.122 --> 02:09:21.002]  Are you saying that they were demolished?
[02:09:21.043 --> 02:09:25.544]  Now, if you were, then one has to look at why that happened and how that happened.
[02:09:26.004 --> 02:09:30.665]  And we looked into that and we came to the conclusion that the evidence just doesn't support that conspiracy theory.
[02:09:30.685 --> 02:09:31.625]  Okay, let me stop you right there.
[02:09:31.665 --> 02:09:33.265]  Let me bring on Paul Watson from England.
[02:09:33.285 --> 02:09:36.846]  He's been writing articles, you may have even seen some, concerning the piece that you did.
[02:09:37.406 --> 02:09:40.087]  You use a NOVA simulation in the piece.
[02:09:40.567 --> 02:09:43.128]  That has been completely debunked by David Ray Griffin and others.
[02:09:43.148 --> 02:09:45.068]  They claim there's no central steel columns.
[02:09:45.448 --> 02:09:47.109]  They claim it was a hollow shaft.
[02:09:47.849 --> 02:09:50.190]  Paul Watson, you want to comment on the NOVA piece?
[02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:51.450]  Well, yeah.
[02:09:51.850 --> 02:10:00.332]  Firstly, I would like to say that I actually counted 13 debunkers compared to so-called conspiracy theorists, so it was an even greater number.
[02:10:00.873 --> 02:10:06.274]  And I would ask Mr. Smith, why, when we've had government officials, scientists, first responders,
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:10.681]  MI5 agents on this show talking about our side of the evidence.
[02:10:11.121 --> 02:10:17.743]  Did he decide to give ten minutes to a producer of a sci-fi show that went off the air five years ago?
[02:10:20.764 --> 02:10:21.344]  Mr. Smith?
[02:10:21.745 --> 02:10:28.727]  Yeah, we decided to talk to Frank Spottnitz because he had very many interesting things to say about conspiracy theories.
[02:10:28.747 --> 02:10:29.727]  It's as simple as that.
[02:10:29.747 --> 02:10:34.188]  Basically, that it's a modern religion of delusionals.
[02:10:34.268 --> 02:10:35.589]  Now, in the Nova piece,
[02:10:36.569 --> 02:10:40.711]  It shows... Paul, you've measured it and timed it.
[02:10:40.931 --> 02:10:51.676]  Give him the exact seconds, and it comes out to about 55 seconds for the towers to fall, but in reality they fell in a little over 10 seconds, so even the NOVA piece is false, Paul.
[02:10:52.336 --> 02:10:52.916]  Well, that's right.
[02:10:52.996 --> 02:11:04.701]  If you take the conservative estimate and say the towers fell in 14 to 16 seconds, what we've got is Mr. Smith, in the documentary near the beginning when he talks about controlled demolition,
[02:11:05.322 --> 02:11:22.839]  He uses a graphic animation from Nova, which is a PBS scientific documentary, which depicts the collapse of the Twin Towers at a rate of 6 floors per second, meaning that the total collapse of each tower would have taken around 66 seconds.
[02:11:23.380 --> 02:11:27.624]  So it's a patently false and misleading graphic to use, and
[02:11:28.177 --> 02:11:41.302]  My question is, you know, will there be a retraction of this graphic which is blatantly false and misleading and only lends to the bias that was already decided on in dismissing questions about controlled demolition?
[02:11:43.976 --> 02:11:44.517]  Mr. Smith?
[02:11:45.497 --> 02:11:46.879]  That graphic wasn't misleading.
[02:11:46.919 --> 02:11:48.780]  I don't know, you're talking about it coming from NOVA.
[02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:51.723]  It was actually made by the BBC, that graphic.
[02:11:51.743 --> 02:11:55.486]  Well, the point is, it was used on the NOVA program as well, I don't know.
[02:11:55.767 --> 02:12:07.297]  But the point is, if you're suggesting that the World Trade Center was demolished by explosives, then I would say, where is the cast iron evidence to back that up?
[02:12:09.178 --> 02:12:10.999]  Let me stop you, let me stop you then.
[02:12:11.959 --> 02:12:24.426]  Craig Bartmer, who was in the news, on record, giving citations, on the pile for 5 days, there when 7 collapsed, has reported, and I've got now over 15 firefighters and police coming on in the next week.
[02:12:24.466 --> 02:12:26.007]  We're lining them all up for one show.
[02:12:26.287 --> 02:12:26.987]  Hope you tune in.
[02:12:27.007 --> 02:12:28.568]  It'll be 3 hours of witnesses.
[02:12:29.088 --> 02:12:31.009]  That said, we were told to get back from 7.
[02:12:31.390 --> 02:12:33.791]  They were going to bring it down so it wouldn't damage other buildings.
[02:12:34.091 --> 02:12:35.232]  They were going to blow it up.
[02:12:35.292 --> 02:12:37.573]  We have CNN with two cops going, get back, get back.
[02:12:38.274 --> 02:12:38.974]  7's going to come down.
[02:12:39.014 --> 02:12:39.354]  Get back.
[02:12:39.394 --> 02:12:40.495]  They're bringing it down.
[02:12:40.975 --> 02:12:41.316]  Okay?
[02:12:41.416 --> 02:12:43.937]  We clearly have this over and over again.
[02:12:44.237 --> 02:12:46.279]  In fact, right now, go ahead.
[02:12:46.339 --> 02:12:49.200]  Let's first play the molten steel clip from New York TV.
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:53.043]  Here are firefighters talking about molten steel like a foundry like lava.
[02:12:53.063 --> 02:12:53.383]  Here it is.
[02:12:54.019 --> 02:12:56.842]  You'd get down below and you'd see molten steel.
[02:12:57.522 --> 02:12:59.544]  Molten steel running down the channel rails.
[02:12:59.965 --> 02:13:01.066]  Like you're in a foundry.
[02:13:02.527 --> 02:13:03.048]  Like lava.
[02:13:03.548 --> 02:13:06.731]  Like lava in the volcano.
[02:13:07.051 --> 02:13:18.122]  Okay, now let's play the next clip, and just in case you've never seen these or heard these, and the videos are up on the website, here's CNN with two cops saying, get back, they're gonna bring it down, seven's coming down, they say it three times, here it is, CNN.
[02:13:20.233 --> 02:13:21.195]  Can you hear that?
[02:13:21.215 --> 02:13:21.836]  Keep your eyes open.
[02:13:21.916 --> 02:13:22.517]  It's coming down.
[02:13:22.577 --> 02:13:24.780]  Don't let it start to blow up.
[02:13:24.821 --> 02:13:26.303]  Move it back.
[02:13:26.423 --> 02:13:27.144]  Alright guys.
[02:13:27.204 --> 02:13:29.288]  We are occupied.
[02:13:36.484 --> 02:13:40.427]  Okay, so we not only have that, and again, there's over 15 coming on the show, we've already had a bunch of them on.
[02:13:40.447 --> 02:13:44.429]  I've interviewed Barton Merfour video for an upcoming film in New York, he can barely breathe.
[02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:54.016]  Now, he tried to be interviewed by you, and you didn't want to talk to him, and he said that he was there, and they said, get back, they're going to bring the building down.
[02:13:54.516 --> 02:13:58.259]  Now, you just heard clips, I'm asking you, why didn't you want to talk to a police officer?
[02:13:59.238 --> 02:14:04.842]  Well, um, I don't know about that particular police officer, um, but... But you met him!
[02:14:04.922 --> 02:14:05.422]  You met him!
[02:14:05.482 --> 02:14:06.083]  He was there!
[02:14:06.103 --> 02:14:08.685]  He went up in upstate New York to meet with you!
[02:14:08.705 --> 02:14:12.627]  Uh, I guess he must have been one of the people who was at Dylan Avery's house.
[02:14:12.847 --> 02:14:15.309]  I think that's probably what you're referring to.
[02:14:15.329 --> 02:14:15.990]  Yes, yes, a police officer.
[02:14:16.210 --> 02:14:16.530]  Yes, uh, yes.
[02:14:17.594 --> 02:14:24.562]  Well, look, we could spend all day talking about whether there was molten steel or whether it was something else in the basement of the World Trade Center.
[02:14:25.002 --> 02:14:28.546]  But what you have to do is to look at the bottom line theory.
[02:14:28.566 --> 02:14:35.053]  Now, if you're saying those twin towers were demolished, I have yet to understand why they were demolished.
[02:14:35.803 --> 02:14:37.364]  And how they were demolished.
[02:14:37.904 --> 02:14:41.366]  All I can say is that the evidence that we have looked at just doesn't stack up.
[02:14:41.386 --> 02:14:48.731]  I mean, is it really plausible that people would have flown two planes into these tin towers and laced them with demolition charges?
[02:14:48.751 --> 02:14:50.252]  We're not saying that.
[02:14:50.292 --> 02:14:51.132]  No, they were pre-placed.
[02:14:51.152 --> 02:14:51.933]  What about seven?
[02:14:52.193 --> 02:14:53.354]  No plane hit seven.
[02:14:53.634 --> 02:14:58.397]  The CIA, the FBI, Defense Intelligence, it was a giant intelligence building.
[02:14:59.037 --> 02:15:00.198]  It had the command center
[02:15:00.998 --> 02:15:02.540]  But is it really plausible, do you think, that
[02:15:18.863 --> 02:15:32.917]  World Trade Center 7 would have been demolished, and five years later, nobody who was involved in planting those demolition charges wouldn't have spoken to their wife or girlfriend or come forward and admitted that they were part of that.
[02:15:32.997 --> 02:15:34.758]  Hold on, let me finish.
[02:15:34.799 --> 02:15:37.161]  How did they have Tuskegee for 40 plus years?
[02:15:37.541 --> 02:15:47.910]  Killing black men with syphilis secret, the atomic soldiers, the ringworm children in Israel where they radiated 110,000, the Manhattan Project kept secret with over 100,000 people involved.
[02:15:48.231 --> 02:15:48.751]  Come on!
[02:15:49.292 --> 02:15:53.916]  The people who were involved in that and black ops know they'd be killed the minute they went public.
[02:15:54.815 --> 02:15:59.637]  Well, I mean, yeah, you talk about the Manhattan Project, and that's a very interesting example.
[02:15:59.677 --> 02:16:08.601]  But it's something that's quite different, because here, remember, 3000 American citizens died, or American and citizens from other countries as well, including Britain.
[02:16:08.982 --> 02:16:16.305]  So, you know, it's like, you seem to think that we're trying to cover something up, you know, we're not covering anything up.
[02:16:16.824 --> 02:16:23.606]  All we're doing is looking at the evidence in an objective, dispassionate way, and trying to test whether it stands up to determination.
[02:16:23.626 --> 02:16:24.066]  John Smith!
[02:16:24.306 --> 02:16:34.229]  No modern steel building, and you can show some two-story thing in England or some two-story thing that's tar-roofed in Chicago, no modern steel building has ever fallen.
[02:16:34.249 --> 02:16:39.851]  Look at the Madrid, 100-foot white-hot flames, almost two days burning, no major steel members collapsed.
[02:16:39.931 --> 02:16:41.051]  It's scientific.
[02:16:41.551 --> 02:16:41.971]  Facts!
[02:16:42.171 --> 02:16:48.134]  Building 7 wasn't hit by a plane, had small fires, and symmetrically collapsed.
[02:16:48.154 --> 02:16:49.314]  You should give us evidence.
[02:16:49.714 --> 02:16:51.755]  I just gave you the name of a police officer.
[02:16:51.795 --> 02:16:56.377]  I just played CNN, where they're saying, get back, they're gonna bring the building down, it's gonna blow up.
[02:16:56.697 --> 02:16:57.338]  Now, what more?
[02:16:57.558 --> 02:17:00.759]  I mean, I could go on for hours with these clips, and you will not address it!
[02:17:01.593 --> 02:17:02.953]  No, it's not that I'm not addressing it.
[02:17:03.033 --> 02:17:10.035]  I'm just saying that I don't believe that that evidence proves that there was a conspiracy to demolish World Trade Center 7.
[02:17:10.776 --> 02:17:13.136]  And it's something, you know, I accept that we're not going to agree on this.
[02:17:13.316 --> 02:17:14.096]  And that's fair enough.
[02:17:14.217 --> 02:17:20.018]  And I'm very happy to come on the program and talk about my view and say, look, this is what we've found out.
[02:17:20.458 --> 02:17:26.460]  If we had found evidence to show that it was demolished by explosives, you know, we would have put that in our film.
[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:29.061]  We're not trying to cover anything up here.
[02:17:29.181 --> 02:17:33.802]  All I can say is that I don't believe the evidence that you're putting forward.
[02:17:34.863 --> 02:17:35.723]  All right, stay there.
[02:17:35.743 --> 02:17:41.905]  I'd like to hear how you don't believe it and walk through things with Dylan Avery and Paul Joseph Watson on the other side.
[02:17:43.795 --> 02:17:46.797]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:17:47.117 --> 02:17:52.039]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:56.642]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:17:56.942 --> 02:18:05.867]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:18:06.067 --> 02:18:09.689]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:18:09.969 --> 02:18:14.992]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:18:15.292 --> 02:18:21.996]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:18:22.515 --> 02:18:23.156]  What about you?
[02:18:23.816 --> 02:18:29.160]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:18:43.487 --> 02:18:44.368]  Ted Anders for Midas.
[02:18:44.408 --> 02:18:44.748]  February 16, 2007.
[02:18:44.928 --> 02:18:45.228]  Gold 664.90.
[02:18:45.269 --> 02:18:47.951]  Ounce gold coins are at 686.35, 345.73 for half, 172.87 for quarter ounce.
[02:18:47.991 --> 02:18:48.451]  That's 686.35, 345.73, and 172.87.
[02:18:58.659 --> 02:19:00.521]  1971, Nixon closes the gold window.
[02:19:00.601 --> 02:19:01.421]  Fiat currency.
[02:19:02.202 --> 02:19:06.045]  1920s, the German market explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[02:19:06.365 --> 02:19:09.308]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[02:19:09.328 --> 02:19:12.150]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[02:19:12.170 --> 02:19:15.833]  1998, gold jumps 2 thirds over the Russian ruble.
[02:19:15.853 --> 02:19:18.555]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[02:19:18.815 --> 02:19:23.979]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[02:19:24.119 --> 02:19:25.420]  Could government let this happen?
[02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:27.502]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[02:19:27.722 --> 02:19:29.303]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:29.344 --> 02:19:33.387]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[02:19:53.516 --> 02:20:00.400]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:10.044]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[02:20:11.145 --> 02:20:19.089]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:43.311 --> 02:20:48.258]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:20:48.578 --> 02:20:50.460]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:20:50.661 --> 02:20:53.705]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:20:53.885 --> 02:20:57.029]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:20:57.329 --> 02:20:59.172]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:20:59.432 --> 02:21:03.133]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:21:03.413 --> 02:21:06.074]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible!
[02:21:06.094 --> 02:21:10.996]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:21:11.196 --> 02:21:15.457]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:21:15.897 --> 02:21:20.220]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[02:21:20.540 --> 02:21:24.783]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:21:25.123 --> 02:21:31.007]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[02:21:31.308 --> 02:21:33.729]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:21:33.929 --> 02:21:34.430]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:21:34.450 --> 02:21:35.550]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[02:21:56.962 --> 02:21:58.362]  Welcome back, Guy Smith.
[02:21:59.383 --> 02:22:01.723]  I appreciate him joining us, spending time with us today.
[02:22:01.743 --> 02:22:03.904]  BBC producer, director,
[02:22:04.637 --> 02:22:07.238]  Guy, I want to let Paul ask you questions.
[02:22:07.278 --> 02:22:08.679]  Dylan Avery asked a question first.
[02:22:08.719 --> 02:22:09.739]  We do appreciate your time.
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:11.680]  In the next segment, it's a long 15-minute segment.
[02:22:11.981 --> 02:22:13.181]  This is just a quick 5-minute one.
[02:22:13.201 --> 02:22:16.383]  We'll let you run for a few minutes and I'll shut up and hear what you have to say.
[02:22:16.423 --> 02:22:17.843]  But I'd like you to answer this question.
[02:22:18.204 --> 02:22:19.024]  We've answered yours.
[02:22:19.844 --> 02:22:23.946]  I kept begging you, please let me cover Operation Northwoods, the official U.S.
[02:22:23.986 --> 02:22:27.968]  government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks to blame it on a foreign enemy.
[02:22:28.028 --> 02:22:33.111]  I said Gulf of Tonkin was staged, now declassified, Operation Ajax in Iran.
[02:22:33.471 --> 02:22:35.933]  That's so important that there is a past M.O.
[02:22:35.953 --> 02:22:39.575]  You know, the people who try to debunk us always say, why would they do it?
[02:22:39.635 --> 02:22:40.475]  What would they gain?
[02:22:40.735 --> 02:22:47.459]  Trillions in oil, billions in opium, control, military contracts, domestic police state, just like Hitler burned his own Reichstag.
[02:22:48.573 --> 02:22:54.159]  You told me, no, Northwoods isn't going in here, it doesn't fit into it, it doesn't matter.
[02:22:54.479 --> 02:23:06.051]  Now tell me why, if you made a film about the 9-11 Truth Movement, why you wouldn't cover the central issues of the history of government-sponsored terror and the history of plans to carry out terror against the American people.
[02:23:06.591 --> 02:23:07.912]  Will you please answer that question?
[02:23:08.333 --> 02:23:09.474]  Yes, indeed, Alex.
[02:23:10.795 --> 02:23:16.682]  Operation Northwoods is fascinating, and from a historical point of view, it's a very interesting story.
[02:23:17.403 --> 02:23:20.127]  But I have yet to see any evidence.
[02:23:20.780 --> 02:23:24.262]  That links Operation Northwood to what happened on 9-11.
[02:23:24.702 --> 02:23:33.266]  There's no doubt that the American government and other governments, no doubt the British government as well, has been involved in all sorts of operations in the past.
[02:23:33.346 --> 02:23:35.207]  False flag operations, as you call it.
[02:23:36.568 --> 02:23:37.589]  But I have no doubt.
[02:23:37.649 --> 02:23:43.171]  I mean, as you mentioned, the Gulf of Tonkin is a very interesting example.
[02:23:43.632 --> 02:23:45.312]  But I have no evidence
[02:23:46.658 --> 02:23:56.044]  And I have yet to see any convincing theories that show that what happened with the proposal of Operation Northwoods was put into practice on 9-11.
[02:23:56.064 --> 02:23:58.185]  Well, this is why it's important, Guy.
[02:23:58.205 --> 02:23:58.965]  Okay?
[02:23:59.025 --> 02:24:00.026]  And you make a valid point.
[02:24:00.566 --> 02:24:01.567]  This is why it's important.
[02:24:01.607 --> 02:24:12.013]  Let's say a six-foot-two, gray-haired man with a red birthmark on his left cheek is videotaped robbing a bank and pistol-whipping a clerk.
[02:24:13.027 --> 02:24:22.613]  And then the police run through a database of mug books and they notice that a bank robber, who fits that description, got out of prison six months ago and lives in the area.
[02:24:22.913 --> 02:24:26.795]  And they go by his house and they pull him over when he leaves and he's got the cash in the trunk.
[02:24:27.236 --> 02:24:33.199]  If you've got people that have done this before and plan to do this, my goodness, I think that's pretty darn important!
[02:24:33.499 --> 02:24:34.140]  What do you think?
[02:24:34.978 --> 02:24:39.740]  Well, I think that Operation Northwoods was a very interesting subject.
[02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:43.162]  You know, it's something that was talked about more than 40 years ago.
[02:24:43.542 --> 02:24:49.525]  Just because there was this plan more than 40 years ago, which, you know, I don't deny, you're absolutely right, it existed.
[02:24:49.825 --> 02:24:52.286]  Although, of course, it wasn't actually adopted by the President.
[02:24:52.306 --> 02:24:55.267]  Well, it was green-lighted and Kennedy said no and then got his head blown off.
[02:24:55.488 --> 02:24:58.449]  And let me guess, you don't think the government was involved in killing Kennedy, right?
[02:24:59.466 --> 02:25:00.567]  Well, that's a whole other story.
[02:25:00.607 --> 02:25:04.790]  I don't know, to be honest, because I haven't investigated the Canadian fascination.
[02:25:04.810 --> 02:25:09.534]  Well, the debunkers are losing because 92% of Americans in major polls know the truth now, Guy.
[02:25:09.975 --> 02:25:16.560]  Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know about JFK, to be honest, but what I do know is that I haven't seen any evidence
[02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:17.380]  Yes, I think.
[02:25:33.112 --> 02:25:34.233]  Because I haven't seen the evidence.
[02:25:34.313 --> 02:25:36.274]  If you show me the evidence, then I'll believe it.
[02:25:36.294 --> 02:25:40.937]  It shows that they've planned this before and they've carried out operations before.
[02:25:40.957 --> 02:25:47.001]  What it shows is that 40 years ago there were people who thought that things like this could be done and should be done.
[02:25:47.041 --> 02:25:50.464]  And then in 64, it was done with Tonkin.
[02:25:50.804 --> 02:25:53.025]  And in 67, it was done with the Liberty.
[02:25:53.506 --> 02:25:56.568]  And similar things, Operation Gladio in Europe.
[02:25:56.988 --> 02:25:57.989]  But let's just go back.
[02:25:58.749 --> 02:25:59.670]  I don't think so.
[02:26:20.290 --> 02:26:24.794]  The current occupants of the White House dusted it off and put it into practice in 2001.
[02:26:24.914 --> 02:26:31.179]  Even though PNAC said we need a helpful Pearl Harbor event and Brzezinski said we needed a Pearl Harbor event.
[02:26:31.459 --> 02:26:38.325]  By the way, Brzezinski said two weeks ago in congressional testimony that there may be a false flag attack blamed on Iran in this country.
[02:26:39.025 --> 02:26:43.329]  Well, I think the PNAC report didn't say we should have a Pearl Harbor event.
[02:26:43.389 --> 02:26:46.611]  It said it would help, minus that catalyzing event.
[02:26:47.152 --> 02:26:48.833]  And then Brzezinski said it would help.
[02:26:50.086 --> 02:26:52.307]  I don't think it says, actually, it would help.
[02:26:52.467 --> 02:26:58.350]  I think what it says is that it wouldn't happen unless there was a Pearl Harbor... Gee, we want to invade these countries.
[02:26:58.390 --> 02:26:59.890]  It won't happen unless this happens.
[02:27:00.270 --> 02:27:02.491]  We need to use this disaster for a new world order.
[02:27:02.771 --> 02:27:05.272]  Well, I mean, I hear what you're saying.
[02:27:05.432 --> 02:27:09.114]  I guess people who disagree with what you're saying would say,
[02:27:09.674 --> 02:27:16.758]  If it really was then a plot, why would the PNAC report writers publish their report in advance and put it all over the internet?
[02:27:16.778 --> 02:27:17.719]  Because they're arrogant!
[02:27:17.759 --> 02:27:18.179]  Stay there!
[02:27:18.259 --> 02:27:20.220]  I apologize to Paul and Dylan.
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:21.161]  We will go to you guys.
[02:27:21.461 --> 02:27:24.563]  You can have the floor and questions for Guy Smith on the other side.
[02:27:24.583 --> 02:27:25.203]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:25.243 --> 02:27:26.324]  Thank you for joining us, guys.
[02:27:26.344 --> 02:27:30.546]  Stay with us.
[02:27:33.868 --> 02:27:34.809]  We're on the march.
[02:27:34.829 --> 02:27:36.750]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.765 --> 02:27:40.527]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:43.830 --> 02:27:46.532]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[02:27:46.812 --> 02:27:48.874]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[02:27:49.114 --> 02:27:51.636]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[02:27:52.076 --> 02:27:56.439]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[02:27:56.559 --> 02:27:57.180]  Here's why.
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:03.785]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[02:28:04.065 --> 02:28:10.573]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[02:28:10.713 --> 02:28:14.438]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[02:28:14.658 --> 02:28:18.884]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[02:28:19.344 --> 02:28:26.546]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[02:28:26.966 --> 02:28:27.687]  Get control.
[02:28:27.807 --> 02:28:28.407]  Get relief.
[02:28:28.607 --> 02:28:29.367]  Get some sleep.

[02:28:44.116 --> 02:28:45.860]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.323]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:28:47.484 --> 02:28:50.290]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:28:50.690 --> 02:28:53.396]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:28:53.977 --> 02:29:00.701]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:30:33.292 --> 02:30:33.973]  I think so.
[02:30:53.306 --> 02:30:58.771]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[02:30:58.791 --> 02:31:04.196]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[02:31:04.236 --> 02:31:06.919]  We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'.
[02:31:06.959 --> 02:31:09.622]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[02:31:09.642 --> 02:31:14.666]  We fired once more and they'd forget to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:31:17.674 --> 02:31:39.121]  We looked down the river and we see the British come And there must have been a hundred of them beatin' on the drum They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring We stood beside our cotton fields and didn't say a thing We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they began to runnin' On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[02:31:43.780 --> 02:31:44.120]  Welcome back!
[02:32:08.892 --> 02:32:12.314]  Our guest is Guy Smith, BBC producer, director.
[02:32:12.474 --> 02:32:17.817]  We appreciate him coming on and letting us go over the piece that he put out.
[02:32:18.777 --> 02:32:28.142]  And now I'd like to give Dylan Avery a chance to ask a few questions and then of course Guy can ask questions of him or make statements if he'd like and then Paul Watson to come back in.
[02:32:28.162 --> 02:32:29.903]  Dylan Avery, producer of Loose Change 1 and 2.
[02:32:31.303 --> 02:32:37.867]  That, by the way, we carry at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, where you can watch for free at Google Video, as well as my film, Terror Storm.
[02:32:39.367 --> 02:32:41.429]  Let's now go to Guy Smith.
[02:32:41.589 --> 02:32:43.450]  Dylan, do you have any questions or comments for him?
[02:32:44.230 --> 02:32:46.992]  Yeah, my first one is, how can I drop out of something I never attended?
[02:32:50.494 --> 02:32:56.717]  Well, your narrator referred to me as a self-professed dropout, indicating that I actually went to college and stopped attending.
[02:32:57.236 --> 02:33:04.158]  When in reality, I applied for Purchase College twice, and because the film program there is entirely selective, I was not selected.
[02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:09.191]  So in all of your research, I found it interesting that you couldn't even get the facts about me right.
[02:33:09.531 --> 02:33:12.532]  And of course, that's been one of the rumors is that you're this evil dropout.
[02:33:12.592 --> 02:33:16.614]  I mean, you know, so is Bill Gates and Rush Limbaugh and Dick Cheney for that matter.
[02:33:16.654 --> 02:33:20.235]  But the point is, is that you'd mentioned earlier you thought that would be in the piece.
[02:33:20.995 --> 02:33:27.297]  Yeah, guy, you talk about he's a self-professed dropout, but you don't have video of Dylan saying he's a dropout because he never went to college.
[02:33:28.057 --> 02:33:29.838]  Yeah, I know Dylan didn't go to college.
[02:33:29.938 --> 02:33:37.243]  I guess the way we use the term dropout in English, I don't know about American, is somebody who doesn't go the conventional route.
[02:33:38.563 --> 02:33:42.946]  It doesn't mean literally that you dropped out of college because I know that you... Let me bring Paul Watson up.
[02:33:43.126 --> 02:33:44.707]  He's English, okay?
[02:33:44.747 --> 02:33:47.048]  Let's bring Paul Watson from Sheffield on.
[02:33:47.289 --> 02:33:49.470]  Paul, does dropout mean you never went to college?
[02:33:50.433 --> 02:33:58.639]  No, drop out implies explicitly that you went to university and were not able to complete the course, ergo you dropped out.
[02:33:58.959 --> 02:34:01.161]  That's what it means in America, that's what it means in England.
[02:34:01.501 --> 02:34:07.105]  Well, it can also mean that you drop out of a system or you drop out of society, you know, it can mean lots of things.
[02:34:07.125 --> 02:34:07.886]  Well, that's a new one on me.
[02:34:08.406 --> 02:34:14.048]  Okay, well, listen, I am a college dropout, even though I had a 3.8 grade average because I didn't need it.
[02:34:14.308 --> 02:34:24.950]  Now, Steve Watson that works in our research department has a master's degree in political science and foreign affairs, so he thinks it's an inside job too, but he has a master's degree, is it okay now?
[02:34:25.671 --> 02:34:30.332]  No, I'm not trying to dissuade anybody from believing it's an inside job.
[02:34:31.072 --> 02:34:37.934]  If you want to believe it's an inside job, that's fine, that's up to you, and I fully accept that you have
[02:34:38.294 --> 02:34:41.377]  Well, you know what, maybe Paul in Sheffield, so maybe somebody from London
[02:34:56.770 --> 02:34:59.611]  Born and bred, London, call in 1-800-259-9231.
[02:35:01.311 --> 02:35:03.912]  Let us know, does drop out mean never went to college?
[02:35:04.592 --> 02:35:07.292]  Because in my book that's not what it means and Paul says you're incorrect.
[02:35:07.672 --> 02:35:18.835]  Come on guy, we know it's a snipet, Dylan Avery, you know, like he's some gutter snipe miscreant out there rubbing his oily hands together and attacking the beautiful crown's operation.
[02:35:19.676 --> 02:35:21.258]  Well, I would say on the contrary.
[02:35:21.278 --> 02:35:28.749]  We interviewed Dylan for the film and we showed how his film has had enormous impact and has been viewed tens of millions of times all around the world.
[02:35:29.389 --> 02:35:31.372]  And we were trying to make a serious point.
[02:35:31.432 --> 02:35:32.334]  We were showing how
[02:35:32.862 --> 02:35:38.405]  Now, conspiracy theories can proliferate through the internet in a way that they couldn't have done in the past.
[02:35:38.525 --> 02:35:42.767]  Do you think there should be some type of regulation to stop this type of hateful spread?
[02:35:42.787 --> 02:35:44.528]  No, no, not at all.
[02:35:44.628 --> 02:35:46.909]  I think it's a very healthy thing for society.
[02:35:47.250 --> 02:35:52.332]  And I think it's great that you're talking about it, and that's why I'm very happy to come on your show.
[02:35:52.853 --> 02:35:55.614]  Because I think it's good that we should talk about all these things.
[02:35:55.674 --> 02:35:57.935]  I think that's really important, and that's why we made the program.
[02:35:58.055 --> 02:35:58.856]  Okay, fair enough.
[02:35:58.896 --> 02:36:00.076]  Dylan, any other questions?
[02:36:00.196 --> 02:36:01.097]  Dylan, any other questions?
[02:36:02.423 --> 02:36:03.984]  Man, Alex, I got tons of questions.
[02:36:04.404 --> 02:36:14.950]  My first one is, you know, Guy, your narrator makes a lot of jabs about how we're disrespecting the family members and how we're going to continue to ask questions no matter how much it displeases the victims.
[02:36:15.430 --> 02:36:16.871]  Have you ever heard of the Jersey Girls?
[02:36:17.324 --> 02:36:18.764]  Maybe the Family Steering Committee?
[02:36:19.125 --> 02:36:20.145]  Maybe Bill Doyle?
[02:36:20.265 --> 02:36:21.465]  Maybe Bob McElveen?
[02:36:22.726 --> 02:36:31.988]  The list of names... The head of the biggest victims family group who lost his son in the attacks said that he believes it's an inside job.
[02:36:32.008 --> 02:36:34.429]  We have the transcript and the audio on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:36:34.849 --> 02:36:35.850]  And he said this last year.
[02:36:35.950 --> 02:36:39.050]  He said that more than half of his members believe it's an inside job.
[02:36:39.431 --> 02:36:40.511]  So what do you say to that, Guy?
[02:36:41.331 --> 02:36:44.274]  Well, what I say is that I accept that they have the right to that view.
[02:36:44.794 --> 02:36:47.676]  All I can say is that we didn't come to that conclusion.
[02:36:48.016 --> 02:36:55.682]  Yes, there'll be many people who are families of victims who support the conspiracy theories, claiming that it was an inside job.
[02:36:55.722 --> 02:36:58.364]  The official story's a conspiracy theory, Guy!
[02:36:58.404 --> 02:37:04.529]  You claimed two passports, fell out of the sky at ground zero, unburned, and then the FBI had to retract that?
[02:37:04.669 --> 02:37:06.230]  They planted those passports!
[02:37:07.333 --> 02:37:11.437]  Well, I haven't seen any evidence to prove that those passports were planted.
[02:37:11.537 --> 02:37:14.079]  I've seen lots of theories on the internet.
[02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:18.203]  No, the FBI has now said that they didn't find the passports.
[02:37:18.943 --> 02:37:19.624]  You didn't know that?
[02:37:20.244 --> 02:37:24.969]  Well, I think the passports, as I understand it, were found by passers-by and handed in to the FBI.
[02:37:27.438 --> 02:37:30.039]  Oh my gosh, just like all the confession letters.
[02:37:30.099 --> 02:37:39.362]  Hey, I tried to get you to talk about how the Dean of the Defense Language School said three of the hijackers trained in a secret program in 2000 in Monterey, California.
[02:37:39.622 --> 02:37:44.664]  I tried to get you to cover Newsweek where hijackers were reportedly trained at the Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[02:37:44.864 --> 02:37:47.385]  I tried to get you to interview Mr. Springman, the former head of the U.S.
[02:37:47.445 --> 02:37:49.506]  Embassy, who was told to let them into the U.S.
[02:37:49.566 --> 02:37:53.927]  They're really anti-terror fighters, and that their terror designation is a cover.
[02:37:54.167 --> 02:37:55.568]  Guy, why didn't that make it in the film?
[02:37:56.523 --> 02:38:00.228]  Well, there are over 50 different conspiracy theories around 9-11.
[02:38:00.429 --> 02:38:02.131]  That's admitted, sir!
[02:38:02.351 --> 02:38:09.361]  They started court-martialing the head of the Defense Language School until he said he would shut up about it.
[02:38:09.662 --> 02:38:10.403]  I talked to him!
[02:38:12.351 --> 02:38:15.334]  What's the bottom line that you're trying to say, Alex?
[02:38:15.515 --> 02:38:18.598]  Are you saying that we're part of this conspiracy?
[02:38:18.978 --> 02:38:32.552]  Well, I'm saying that just like people in Russia or Germany or China couldn't believe the government had gone bad, and then later they had to admit it, I think that you have a preconceived notion, a preconceived view,
[02:38:33.072 --> 02:38:49.436]  And I'm saying you disregarded most of the key evidence like 44,000 US troops and 18,000 British troops massed in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in the four months before 9-11 and Newsweek and Associated Press reporting that Bush the day before the attacks had the launch orders to attack Afghanistan on his desk.
[02:38:52.486 --> 02:39:05.002]  I mean, it's very difficult to answer them, some of these points, because what you're doing is you're quoting things that you claim that you've heard, and there's some things that are on the internet and... No, they're mainstream... Okay, let me stop you right there.
[02:39:05.342 --> 02:39:09.487]  What about the two FBI agents that went to prison for insider trading before 9-11?
[02:39:13.821 --> 02:39:24.117]  I don't know the details of that particular story, but I do know that there are a lot of stories that are circulating on the internet that are not based on fact.
[02:39:24.338 --> 02:39:25.740]  They're based on supposition.
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:27.002]  You're not basing that on fact.
[02:39:27.022 --> 02:39:27.783]  You're not giving facts.
[02:39:27.803 --> 02:39:28.765]  Let me just go back here.
[02:39:29.145 --> 02:39:31.967]  Do you know where the story of the Israelis not being in the building came from?
[02:39:31.987 --> 02:39:45.758]  It came from Harots and the Jerusalem Post, because Odigo instant messaging head said, yes, we got a call that something was going to happen, get our people out of the building, and most 9-11 researchers say that Israel clearly wasn't running the attacks.
[02:39:46.198 --> 02:39:51.523]  May have been in some small support role because MI6, Mossad, Chinmet, CIA are all joined at the hip.
[02:39:51.904 --> 02:39:55.507]  That's a real report that indeed there were warnings.
[02:39:55.547 --> 02:40:00.351]  The Arabs weren't in the buildings either because they had warnings and there were locals doing insider trading.
[02:40:00.652 --> 02:40:01.873]  Everybody seemed to know about it.
[02:40:02.033 --> 02:40:03.935]  The buildings were at half capacity that day.
[02:40:04.255 --> 02:40:07.678]  Well, all I can say, Alex, is that that's a view.
[02:40:07.698 --> 02:40:10.521]  I don't share that view from the research that we have done.
[02:40:10.581 --> 02:40:10.901]  What view?
[02:40:11.101 --> 02:40:15.585]  Are you denying that Odigo's head was in the newspapers in Israel saying they got a warning?
[02:40:15.765 --> 02:40:18.808]  Clearly showing they weren't involved because they were public, going, yeah, we got warnings.
[02:40:19.648 --> 02:40:29.217]  I think what you have done here, Alex, is you've raised a very interesting and important point, and that is that much of what is on the internet about 9-11 is based on news reports.
[02:40:29.817 --> 02:40:33.199]  Now, those news reports are not necessarily always accurate.
[02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:51.552]  What happens, as we've seen with the conspiracy theory alleging that 4,000 Jews didn't turn up for work that day, is that the story gets into the media and then it gets twisted and distorted, like we call in England, Chinese whispers, and it just continues and proliferates and becomes more and more complicated.
[02:40:51.932 --> 02:40:52.532]  Yes, I think so.
[02:41:11.304 --> 02:41:12.705]  Sure, Paul Watson you got more comments?
[02:41:35.174 --> 02:41:46.638]  How can Mr. Smith justify using this strong implication on numerous occasions throughout the documentary that questioning the official story of 9-11 is insulting and hurtful to the victims?
[02:41:47.198 --> 02:42:02.644]  How can he justify such a blatant and cynical attempt to emotionally sway the viewer when we've had Bill Doyle on the program, who is the largest representative, the largest group of 9-11 families, and it was a government cover-up in itself in the very hours after 9-11,
[02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:09.863]  The result of which, now we have a situation where 20% of the first responders are dying from that government cover-up.
[02:42:09.883 --> 02:42:20.808]  And by the way, major medical institutions admit their lungs are full of asbestos and concrete, and we have the internal EPA documents where they were ordered to shut it down and cover it up.
[02:42:20.828 --> 02:42:26.451]  That's been in all the major US newspapers, and we were called conspiracy theorists on that.
[02:42:26.731 --> 02:42:30.953]  The truth is, every time the government does something wrong, they just say we're conspiracy theorists.
[02:42:30.993 --> 02:42:31.493]  Mr. Smith?
[02:42:31.893 --> 02:42:34.295]  Yeah, let me go back to the point that Paul was making.
[02:42:35.136 --> 02:42:43.042]  Yes, there are some relatives who are very much in favor of what you're doing and suggesting that this is an inside job.
[02:42:43.062 --> 02:42:44.023]  The majority!
[02:42:44.363 --> 02:42:50.648]  But there are also many relatives of victims of 9-11 who find what you're doing deeply abhorrent.
[02:42:50.828 --> 02:42:52.429]  But you claimed it was all of them!
[02:42:52.469 --> 02:42:54.711]  You implied it was all of them!
[02:42:55.171 --> 02:42:55.772]  It's the bias.
[02:42:56.292 --> 02:42:57.954]  Well, I didn't imply it was all of them.
[02:42:57.994 --> 02:43:20.374]  We said that we had talked to many relatives... You did imply he's a dropout, you did imply it was all of them, you had some psychological test on there where basically you're a bunch of shut-in nuts and it's a religion, and you had some fiction writer get up there from the Lone Gunman and the X-Files for the show, the producer, and basically say that it's a religion that we have.
[02:43:20.434 --> 02:43:20.795]  No sir,
[02:43:21.255 --> 02:43:31.800]  Steel doesn't melt until over 2700 degrees, and there were people in the wounds of those buildings, waving, begging for help, and then giant columns severed right next to them, and then there was molten steel.
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:32.461]  That's a fact.
[02:43:33.881 --> 02:43:38.063]  Well, I mean, again, I come back to the fundamental point.
[02:43:39.204 --> 02:43:47.008]  You're saying that it was an inside job carried out by the American government to start a war for oil in the Middle East and in Asia.
[02:43:48.072 --> 02:43:48.753]  I think so.
[02:44:04.212 --> 02:44:09.034]  I've played eyewitnesses saying, get back, they're going to blow up the building, and I've got a bunch of other clips I can play.
[02:44:09.114 --> 02:44:21.580]  I give the actual witnesses, I give names, we sent you police officers, we sent you people, and you didn't interview them, and you make these large, broad-brush statements about how you've disproven what we've said, and it isn't true.
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:29.203]  Does Mr. Smith admit that there was a bias in editing before the editing of his program, and that he had already come to the conclusion
[02:44:29.847 --> 02:44:32.191]  Uh, that he chose to support the side of the debunkers.
[02:44:32.231 --> 02:44:33.193]  Does he admit that back?
[02:44:33.233 --> 02:44:34.655]  Yeah, he told me that at P.F.
[02:44:34.675 --> 02:44:37.680]  Chang's restaurant, that he didn't agree with me about this stuff.
[02:44:37.700 --> 02:44:38.741]  He doesn't agree about Dr. Kelly?
[02:44:38.761 --> 02:44:39.262]  That's biased!
[02:44:39.362 --> 02:44:40.264]  That's not balanced!
[02:44:41.007 --> 02:44:49.074]  You're held to a higher standard as a BBC journalist to produce the Balance Programme, and you've already come to a bias before you've even finished the filming.
[02:44:49.394 --> 02:44:50.375]  Do you admit that?
[02:44:52.016 --> 02:45:01.364]  We went into this project with an open mind, and let's face it, if supposing during our research we had found that some of these conspiracy theories were true,
[02:45:02.273 --> 02:45:07.557]  We would have certainly put that into the film, because actually, it would have made a much more dramatic and sensational film.
[02:45:07.577 --> 02:45:10.099]  We'd be all over the front page of the newspapers this morning.
[02:45:10.119 --> 02:45:15.262]  Yeah, and then Blair wouldn't take a bunch of your funding again and make your director resign.
[02:45:15.843 --> 02:45:17.304]  Nobody's trying to censor us.
[02:45:17.444 --> 02:45:18.144]  Oh, come on!
[02:45:18.225 --> 02:45:20.546]  Everybody knows they've been censoring the BBC!
[02:45:23.088 --> 02:45:28.172]  Hell, in your country, they arrested Robin Page for saying that rural communities deserve rights!
[02:45:29.569 --> 02:45:35.553]  I can absolutely give you an assurance that nobody is trying to censor what we were saying in this program.
[02:45:35.593 --> 02:45:48.702]  And if we had found through our objective research some evidence to back up the theory that World Trade Center 7 was demolished or United 93 didn't crash at Shanksville, then we would have put that into the program.
[02:45:49.282 --> 02:45:52.325]  Mr. Smith, your conclusions were not based on the evidence.
[02:45:52.385 --> 02:45:56.648]  They were based on portraying Dylan Avery and Alex Jones as a kind of religious cult.
[02:45:56.688 --> 02:45:59.810]  You called Alex an evangelical preacher, basically.
[02:45:59.890 --> 02:46:03.153]  And then you cut to the X-Files guy saying we're a religion.
[02:46:05.835 --> 02:46:14.922]  He was talking about why people believe in conspiracy theories nowadays, and I think he made a very valid point about how, in the past,
[02:46:15.595 --> 02:46:22.942]  We found it difficult to understand what was going on in our world, so we created myths, and now what we're doing is much the same sort of thing.
[02:46:22.962 --> 02:46:24.324]  9-11's a myth!
[02:46:24.344 --> 02:46:27.247]  The official story is a fraud, Mr. Smith.
[02:46:27.427 --> 02:46:28.488]  It's ridiculous.
[02:46:29.489 --> 02:46:35.435]  NIST has given five different reasons Building 7 fell, and now they're saying it could have been because of explosions.
[02:46:36.236 --> 02:46:39.018]  Can I ask you a question, Alex?
[02:46:39.119 --> 02:46:39.299]  Sure.
[02:46:41.338 --> 02:47:00.574]  I hear what you're saying, and there are many people who will agree with you, but some of the people who oppose what you're saying and who disagree with what you're saying may ask this question, and that is, why is it that nobody in the five years since 9-11 who is involved in that conspiracy has come forward to admit their part in it?
[02:47:01.463 --> 02:47:04.705]  Because it would only take a few hundred people to run the op.
[02:47:04.825 --> 02:47:08.567]  Many people that were involved, I believe they were involved in a simulation.
[02:47:08.627 --> 02:47:09.788]  That's how they bootleg it.
[02:47:10.108 --> 02:47:11.489]  And they've done this many, many times.
[02:47:11.729 --> 02:47:12.690]  Let me give you an example.
[02:47:12.710 --> 02:47:12.910]  Stop!
[02:47:12.950 --> 02:47:13.731]  Let me answer your question.
[02:47:14.011 --> 02:47:14.791]  Let me answer your question.
[02:47:15.632 --> 02:47:16.912]  5,000 plus U.S.
[02:47:16.953 --> 02:47:22.156]  troops died from 1959 to 1964 when the Vietnam War officially kicked off.
[02:47:22.456 --> 02:47:23.697]  And they didn't announce until 1965
[02:47:26.278 --> 02:47:31.399]  A year after the war was really on, that thousands had died in covert operations previously.
[02:47:31.679 --> 02:47:32.599]  Thousands of U.S.
[02:47:32.619 --> 02:47:37.340]  troops have died in Colombia in the last 10 years, and that's only barely come out.
[02:47:37.740 --> 02:47:38.060]  Okay?
[02:47:38.321 --> 02:47:42.601]  They covered up, until they wanted to, 5,000 dead U.S.
[02:47:43.462 --> 02:47:47.342]  troops, just like the Russians covered up their true losses in Afghanistan.
[02:47:47.362 --> 02:47:50.443]  So don't tell me for a minute they can't keep black ops secret.
[02:47:51.726 --> 02:48:01.430]  I am absolutely convinced that if there was a Black Ops, as you say, on 9-11, it first of all would have involved not just hundreds but thousands of people.
[02:48:01.831 --> 02:48:05.732]  And I'm quite sure that that Black Ops would have leaked by now.
[02:48:05.752 --> 02:48:11.555]  That people, you know, tell their wives, they tell their girlfriends, they tell their priests they feel guilty about what they've done.
[02:48:12.099 --> 02:48:18.144]  This was a black ops operation, if what you say is true, that was against the American people.
[02:48:18.664 --> 02:48:21.967]  I'm absolutely certain that that story would have leaked out by now.
[02:48:22.047 --> 02:48:22.968]  People would have talked.
[02:48:23.673 --> 02:48:24.694]  It has been leaking.
[02:48:24.794 --> 02:48:30.138]  It has been leaking with firefighters and police talking about how they were told to get back that they were going to blow up building 7.
[02:48:30.838 --> 02:48:32.299]  And more and more is going to leak.
[02:48:32.679 --> 02:48:35.321]  And people like Sybil Edmonds who want to talk have been gagged.
[02:48:35.681 --> 02:48:40.024]  And FBI agent Robert Wright has been told he'll be arrested if he tells people what he knows.
[02:48:40.104 --> 02:48:42.346]  All he said is the Bushes vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[02:48:46.869 --> 02:48:52.294]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:52.695 --> 02:49:00.282]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:08.074]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:08.474 --> 02:49:19.940]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:24.143]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:24.163 --> 02:49:26.124]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:26.444 --> 02:49:30.286]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:48.055 --> 02:51:55.058]  Guy Smith, I only have one more question for you, and then Paul's got a question and Dylan does, and we appreciate you spending an hour with us.
[02:51:55.098 --> 02:51:59.219]  We want you to know that we see what the piece did, tugging on the heartstrings.
[02:51:59.379 --> 02:52:01.660]  Oh, look how we're putting all this out.
[02:52:01.700 --> 02:52:02.441]  It's not going to work.
[02:52:02.461 --> 02:52:04.321]  We're going to totally dissect it 110%.
[02:52:05.542 --> 02:52:08.683]  But you didn't get into Pakistan ISI.
[02:52:08.703 --> 02:52:11.684]  You didn't get into $100,000 wired to Muhammad Ata.
[02:52:11.984 --> 02:52:15.706]  You didn't cover any of that, and people are going to look at that.
[02:52:17.429 --> 02:52:21.080]  Are you a little concerned now over the huge furor this has created, or do you like it?
[02:52:21.884 --> 02:52:22.544]  No, not at all.
[02:52:22.584 --> 02:52:29.866]  I think it's great that people are discussing this subject, and it's a really good thing that people are coming to their own conclusions.
[02:52:30.387 --> 02:52:37.189]  And I absolutely accept that many people will believe that there are conspiracy theories that are true, and that's good, that's fine.
[02:52:37.229 --> 02:52:44.971]  You keep using that little pacifier, your blanket, that it's a conspiracy theory, conspiracy theory.
[02:52:45.191 --> 02:52:47.652]  No, corruption and evil in the global empire.
[02:52:47.832 --> 02:52:49.832]  Do you believe there's a one world government being formed?
[02:52:49.853 --> 02:52:51.253]  I mean, do you even know that's real?
[02:52:52.285 --> 02:52:57.307]  Well, I don't know whether there's a one-world government being formed or not.
[02:52:57.767 --> 02:53:00.268]  The brief of our program was to look at what happened at 9-11.
[02:53:00.289 --> 02:53:02.389]  Yeah, but I had dinner with you.
[02:53:02.449 --> 02:53:04.890]  You don't think Dr. Kelly was killed even when he said he was.
[02:53:05.191 --> 02:53:07.412]  You don't think Diana was killed by the government even when she said it.
[02:53:07.432 --> 02:53:11.713]  I mean, she said, Charles says he's going to kill me in a fake auto accident, and you just poo-poo that.
[02:53:11.733 --> 02:53:15.235]  I mean, that'd be like if I said, Billy Bob says he's going to kill me with a battle axe.
[02:53:15.475 --> 02:53:16.196]  Well, in a sense, Mr. Smith,
[02:53:29.625 --> 02:53:34.269]  Tags us with the label of conspiracy theorists when he supports the official conspiracy theory.
[02:53:34.749 --> 02:53:49.461]  And in doing so, he uses a sole clip of a firefighter on 9-11 discussing damage to Building 7's sprinkler system, while omitting literally dozens and dozens of reports, both footage and from the official firefighter tapes.
[02:53:50.083 --> 02:54:07.636]  who reported bombs at all levels of the Twin Towers and Building 7, and that is not part of his documentary, which suggests clear bias, because he's using individual clips... Yeah, he keeps saying, show evidence, we show it, and then he ignores it.
[02:54:08.277 --> 02:54:13.100]  The evidence that we presented in the program is the evidence that we believe to be credible.
[02:54:13.641 --> 02:54:17.644]  There are many stories that World Trade Center 7 was demolished by explosives.
[02:54:18.334 --> 02:54:21.997]  I have yet to see any credible evidence that stands that theory up.
[02:54:22.297 --> 02:54:24.919]  Just as I have yet to see any... So the fact that it's supporting bombs is not credible?
[02:54:25.980 --> 02:54:27.321]  You didn't even mention it.
[02:54:27.401 --> 02:54:28.522]  You didn't even mention it.
[02:54:28.782 --> 02:54:30.824]  You didn't even have to conclude that it was right.
[02:54:30.864 --> 02:54:32.125]  You could have just mentioned it.
[02:54:32.425 --> 02:54:34.247]  But it's not a balanced piece, Guy.
[02:54:34.267 --> 02:54:35.448]  It's a biased piece.
[02:54:36.172 --> 02:54:37.253]  And everyone can see that.
[02:54:38.173 --> 02:54:49.681]  Well, it's interesting because as well as hearing from the likes of you, I've also had many emails and calls from people who are saying that we're giving too much air time to the conspiracy theories.
[02:54:49.701 --> 02:54:53.044]  So I guess, you know, it's like one can't please everyone all the time.
[02:54:53.064 --> 02:54:57.186]  No, no, we understand and I appreciate you at least coming on this show.
[02:54:57.407 --> 02:54:59.128]  Real fast, Bill, and every final question.
[02:55:00.836 --> 02:55:15.136]  Yeah, you know, throughout the documentary and throughout this interview, Guy talks a lot about following the evidence and how he feels that he covered the 9-11 truth movement, when in reality, as you mentioned, Alex, there was a glaring omission from this BBC documentary that any objective documentary would have covered.
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:30.736]  Although he lauded the fact that two of the hijackers live with a tested FBI informant, he refused to ask Senator Bob Graham why, on the morning of 9-11, he was meeting with George Tenet of the CIA and the head of the Pakistani ISI, who had wired Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker, $100,000 right before the attacks.
[02:55:33.759 --> 02:55:41.026]  Yeah, the role of the Pakistani ISI is a fascinating story, and that's actually something that we could well be returning to in another program.
[02:55:41.046 --> 02:55:47.613]  We might be making a whole program about that connection between Pakistan and the hijackers.
[02:55:47.653 --> 02:55:50.196]  Getting another bucket of white paint out for that, huh?
[02:55:50.296 --> 02:55:52.999]  I'd say watch this space, because that is a very interesting story.
[02:55:53.419 --> 02:56:00.581]  Guy Smith, I appreciate you spending time with us, and I hope to get you back up in the future in the next few months as this develops.
[02:56:00.601 --> 02:56:01.482]  Can we have you back on?
[02:56:02.062 --> 02:56:03.462]  Yeah, I'll be happy to come back on.
[02:56:03.502 --> 02:56:08.824]  And I think if I could just say one final thing very quickly, and that is the good thing that it's great to talk about these subjects.
[02:56:08.904 --> 02:56:10.605]  It's great to air different points of view.
[02:56:11.745 --> 02:56:12.125]  It is.
[02:56:12.285 --> 02:56:13.706]  I appreciate you coming on.
[02:56:13.746 --> 02:56:14.506]  It's good to get us thinking.
[02:56:14.526 --> 02:56:15.847]  I want to thank Paul Watson, Dylan Avery.
[02:56:15.867 --> 02:56:17.047]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:17.307 --> 02:56:18.267]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
