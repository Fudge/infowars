[00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.151]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:07.852]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:09.713]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:11.194]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:12.855]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.496 --> 00:00:17.158]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:21.782]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.194]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:42.795]  Welcome.
[00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:43.976]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:44.937]  It is September 6, 2007.
[00:00:45.017 --> 00:00:47.760]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:59.593]  We'll also have wide open telephones, Richard Gage, the founder of Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[00:01:00.073 --> 00:01:04.394]  He's got a new documentary presentation, 9-11 Blueprint for Truth, out.
[00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:09.035]  We'll be joining us in the third hour today, but other than that, we don't have any guests today.
[00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:11.816]  We'll be taking phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:01:14.037 --> 00:01:18.998]  Israel reportedly dropped some type of munitions deep inside
[00:01:19.907 --> 00:01:25.712]  The territory of Syria yesterday, and we're fired on by air defenses.
[00:01:28.153 --> 00:01:32.477]  We have new very serious rumblings in the housing market we'll be going over.
[00:01:32.497 --> 00:01:46.888]  Ron Paul won several national straw polls yesterday and the debate, and then Fox News tried to spin that and claimed that he had somehow cheated.
[00:01:46.908 --> 00:01:49.650]  Sean Hannity just
[00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.751]  out of the air, grabbed it and made the false statement.
[00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:57.712]  We'll cover that and play the clips coming up in the next segment.
[00:01:58.072 --> 00:02:05.115]  There's so many lies in just the segments I watched online concerning the latest debate.
[00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:12.518]  Hannity has lied to discredit Ron Paul after the debate, claims that Paulites flood
[00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:20.301]  The vote to skew the text poll, yet only one vote per phone number, was allowed.
[00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:38.326]  It didn't matter that the majority of the large stadium that they were holding the debates in were cheering Ron Paul, despite the fact that every other Republican up there was ganging up on him, laughing at him while he was talking, talking over him.
[00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:44.821]  The Fox News pundits literally said, why do you take your orders from Osama Bin Laden?
[00:02:46.162 --> 00:02:50.843]  Now it has reached cartoon level propaganda.
[00:02:50.943 --> 00:02:51.884]  But that's word for word.
[00:02:51.904 --> 00:02:52.684]  We're going to play the clip.
[00:02:52.704 --> 00:02:56.465]  They said, why do you take orders from Bin Laden?
[00:02:57.506 --> 00:02:58.226]  From Al Qaeda?
[00:03:02.108 --> 00:03:04.889]  I mean, this is getting to the point of it's...
[00:03:06.961 --> 00:03:08.942]  I should even have to respond to this?
[00:03:09.902 --> 00:03:10.743]  But yes, we do.
[00:03:10.803 --> 00:03:15.965]  The people watching Fox Television probably like it.
[00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:30.631]  Brett Hume then asked why the United Nations has reported that Iran has nukes and hasn't complied with IAEA.
[00:03:31.966 --> 00:03:32.386]  The U.N.
[00:03:32.406 --> 00:03:35.689]  says they don't have nukes, aren't close to having nukes, and they have complied.
[00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.651]  It's just a total lie!
[00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:42.775]  I mean, the lies are so big now!
[00:03:44.797 --> 00:03:59.530]  But Brett Hume is in a fancy suit with this... ...governly-looking vestige... ...this governly-looking facade, and so it must be true!
[00:04:01.394 --> 00:04:07.020]  This morning I was watching these clips and I literally was trying to write notes and there was too many lies to even write notes.
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.902]  I mean, every three seconds was a lie.
[00:04:08.922 --> 00:04:19.112]  It was just a tapestry of lies and spin and deception and it's getting more and more and more transparent and off the chart.
[00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.410]  And England announces we're going into the European Union whether you like it or not.
[00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.391]  And everyone will have to give DNA.
[00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:28.691]  And if you criticize the government, we'll arrest you.
[00:04:28.992 --> 00:04:30.432]  And no demonstrations allowed.
[00:04:30.972 --> 00:04:32.953]  And I talked to Discovery Channel yesterday.
[00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:34.453]  They're going to be following me around New York.
[00:04:34.493 --> 00:04:36.454]  And they've just been told you're not allowed to film.
[00:04:36.554 --> 00:04:36.954]  Period.
[00:04:37.174 --> 00:04:38.815]  No, we won't even give you a permit.
[00:04:39.455 --> 00:04:40.355]  Just, we're God.
[00:04:40.415 --> 00:04:41.195]  We have weapons.
[00:04:41.335 --> 00:04:41.816]  Shut up.
[00:04:43.076 --> 00:04:45.397]  Australia bans any protest of anything.
[00:04:46.017 --> 00:04:47.798]  I mean, just wall-to-wall evil.
[00:04:47.898 --> 00:04:48.998]  Just in your face.
[00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:52.503]  And they just say back to us, we wear masks, we have guns.
[00:04:52.523 --> 00:04:54.927]  Do you notice we wear a mask and have guns?
[00:04:55.148 --> 00:04:55.749]  We run things.
[00:04:56.049 --> 00:04:56.530]  Shut up!
[00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:57.512]  Shut up!
[00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:06.418]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:05:06.478 --> 00:05:13.803]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:05:13.943 --> 00:05:24.591]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:29.334]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:05:29.594 --> 00:05:34.599]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.743]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:05:37.983 --> 00:05:47.773]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:05:47.853 --> 00:05:53.378]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.840]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:05:57.221 --> 00:06:00.303]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:06:01.144 --> 00:06:04.687]  It's here.
[00:06:04.887 --> 00:06:09.691]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.031 --> 00:06:17.617]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.368 --> 00:06:25.410]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.811 --> 00:06:37.234]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.554 --> 00:06:41.056]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.496 --> 00:06:43.456]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.777 --> 00:06:47.618]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:03.150]  Want to know my little secret?
[00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.153]  I have rich, delicious chocolate as much as I want, every single day.
[00:07:08.614 --> 00:07:10.235]  And I never feel bad about it.
[00:07:10.735 --> 00:07:15.559]  Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea gives you real, natural cocoa, without any fat or sugar.
[00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:23.204]  Even better, Cocoa Pure is made with nutrients that keep my heart healthy, my energy levels up, and my body looking great.
[00:07:23.824 --> 00:07:28.909]  I'm having smooth, tasty chocolate every single day, and it's helping me stay healthier than ever.
[00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:33.753]  You can give yourself the gift of health by calling for a bottle of Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea.
[00:07:34.294 --> 00:07:37.036]  The only thing better than chocolate is healthy chocolate.
[00:07:37.497 --> 00:07:41.020]  Here's how you can get a bottle of delicious Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea.
[00:07:41.937 --> 00:07:47.280]  For your wrist-free bottle of Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea, call 1-800-894-3596.
[00:07:48.181 --> 00:07:52.624]  And if you call now, you can find out how to get a free bottle of Cocoa Pure with your order.
[00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:53.004]  Call 1-800-894-3596.
[00:07:53.024 --> 00:07:53.324]  That's 1-800-894-3596.
[00:07:53.344 --> 00:07:56.486]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:56.506 --> 00:07:57.586]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.161]  I've been on the air for more than 12 years.
[00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:21.843]  I've been studying the New World Order for 15, 16 years intensely.
[00:08:23.263 --> 00:08:27.465]  And I've never seen such a rush to the exits.
[00:08:28.465 --> 00:08:31.546]  I've never witnessed such a pell-mell, wild-eyed,
[00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:38.763]  Bid rigging, looting county, city, state, federal, international funds.
[00:08:39.403 --> 00:08:42.384]  I've never seen such just wanton abandon.
[00:08:42.484 --> 00:08:44.305]  Open announcements of martial law.
[00:08:45.045 --> 00:08:46.566]  Open announcements of torture.
[00:08:46.686 --> 00:08:48.807]  Open announcements of banning free speech.
[00:08:49.687 --> 00:08:51.788]  Open calls for total police state.
[00:08:52.848 --> 00:08:54.329]  DNA databases.
[00:08:54.749 --> 00:08:58.110]  Human cross-species abomination clones.
[00:08:59.655 --> 00:09:02.876]  Environmental degradation, the likes of which we've never seen.
[00:09:03.356 --> 00:09:04.656]  Huge frauds.
[00:09:04.697 --> 00:09:07.277]  They build counterfeits for any real problem.
[00:09:07.577 --> 00:09:13.359]  They then build a fake environmental movement and then push for a tax on life-giving gases to fund their world government.
[00:09:14.099 --> 00:09:22.181]  I mean, it's just... Continuity of government being removed from Congress's control illegally, then transferred to the United Nations.
[00:09:22.481 --> 00:09:23.142]  Publicly.
[00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:24.642]  Earth-shattering.
[00:09:25.222 --> 00:09:27.923]  I mean, that's run down the street screaming bad.
[00:09:28.661 --> 00:09:34.548]  That's... It'd be normal if people were running around screaming and freaking out and beating on their neighbor's doors over that.
[00:09:35.849 --> 00:09:37.671]  But no, we just hardly even cover it here.
[00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:38.772]  We're so desensitized.
[00:09:39.613 --> 00:09:41.716]  Companies making employees all over the U.S.
[00:09:41.756 --> 00:09:48.884]  and Europe take microchips, thumb scanners going in for school lunches everywhere, banks, barber shops.
[00:09:49.838 --> 00:09:55.882]  Tanning salons, gyms, churches, libraries, just total control grid.
[00:09:56.343 --> 00:10:00.285]  I'm now seeing the Pentagon and the media and the government call it the grid.
[00:10:04.248 --> 00:10:05.949]  It's all accelerating.
[00:10:06.009 --> 00:10:07.871]  It's all waxing and waxing.
[00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:10.933]  And I'm here to tell you, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:10:11.753 --> 00:10:13.474]  You think things are accelerating now.
[00:10:13.574 --> 00:10:15.516]  You think things are moving faster now.
[00:10:16.289 --> 00:10:20.513]  Just wait, it's going to get faster and faster and faster and faster.
[00:10:22.214 --> 00:10:28.239]  And that's really their tactic right now, is to, instead of trying to sneak things through, they're just turning it loose.
[00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:38.247]  They're just pulling out all the stops, greasing the skids, runaway terrain, and they're sitting there shoveling more coal into that furnace that's so hot it's about to blow the boiler.
[00:10:42.285 --> 00:10:47.067]  And it just, the more criminal they get, the more wild-eyed, the more daring they get.
[00:10:48.387 --> 00:10:56.130]  I mean, the pundits now on CNN, MSNBC, Fox, but Fox especially, it's reached cartoon level.
[00:10:59.511 --> 00:11:06.293]  And by cartoon level, if I was going to make a movie like Brazil by Terry Gilliam of a kind of neo-1984, I would do it in over-the-top
[00:11:11.201 --> 00:11:11.701]  Fashion.
[00:11:12.242 --> 00:11:21.368]  But even that isn't as bad as cartoonish and as over-pronounced as the war propaganda has gotten.
[00:11:21.428 --> 00:11:34.918]  I mean, it has been reduced down to literally where they're going to start putting devil horns and teeth and say that Ahmadinejad drinks the blood of babies and has bad breath.
[00:11:34.978 --> 00:11:39.962]  I mean, it's gone to a point here, and Ron Paul
[00:11:40.842 --> 00:11:47.184]  What, ten people on the stage all cornering him, all attacking him, Tom Tancredo giggling and snickering.
[00:11:47.404 --> 00:11:50.124]  You can tell now he's the minion, he's the fake, he's the shell.
[00:11:51.225 --> 00:11:54.766]  He's right on the borders, but then not right on every other issue.
[00:11:57.446 --> 00:11:58.466]  Attacking Ron Paul.
[00:11:59.527 --> 00:12:03.448]  But before we get to the Ron Paul clips, here is Sean Hannity lying.
[00:12:04.268 --> 00:12:06.448]  This is up on PrisonPlanet.com, but here's the audio.
[00:12:07.029 --> 00:12:08.509]  Lying at the start of Hannity and Comes.
[00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:11.754]  And there's been big debates about this, the last Fox debate.
[00:12:11.834 --> 00:12:17.858]  Everyone out there knows that it's one text message per phone IP.
[00:12:18.018 --> 00:12:23.041]  And when your phone goes through, that number is seen as the address identifier.
[00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:28.725]  They even advertised before the poll that it was one vote per phone.
[00:12:29.266 --> 00:12:30.767]  It's the same thing with the computer votes.
[00:12:31.027 --> 00:12:32.228]  One vote per IP.
[00:12:34.941 --> 00:12:35.882]  Hannity doesn't care.
[00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:47.050]  He knows he's got an audience that literally believes that Shiites are Sunnis, and who believe that Iran has nukes now, and who believe that Iraq would be a cakewalk.
[00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:55.256]  But Ron Paul's one-liner back, because he says, Why do you follow the orders of Al-Qaeda?
[00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:58.739]  And Ron Paul says, No!
[00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:00.621]  I follow the orders of the Constitution.
[00:13:01.401 --> 00:13:02.462]  But that's coming up.
[00:13:03.266 --> 00:13:11.233]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, Sean Hannity, fake conservative, Judas goat, enemy of the Republic, here he is.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.502]  Welcome back to a special post-debate edition of Hannity and Combs.
[00:13:15.063 --> 00:13:18.906]  And before we get to our next guest, let's take a look at the results so far for tonight.
[00:13:19.426 --> 00:13:21.247]  You vote, in first place, with 33%.
[00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:25.511]  Ron Paul, the Paulites, I guess, busy dialing and redialing on the phone.
[00:13:25.531 --> 00:13:25.951]  You know what?
[00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:27.412]  They're redialing by the second.
[00:13:27.432 --> 00:13:27.653]  All right.
[00:13:27.693 --> 00:13:31.836]  David Giuliani came in second with 16% of your votes, and in third, Mike Huckabee, 15%.
[00:13:32.877 --> 00:13:36.139]  And Ellen Combs lies there, and says, redialing too.
[00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:40.363]  Just a shameful, shameful,
[00:13:41.238 --> 00:13:41.858]  Display.
[00:13:41.978 --> 00:13:45.420]  Now, if you think that's bad, get ready for this in case you missed it.
[00:13:47.681 --> 00:13:56.684]  Now, a couple times they would add, at the start of the question, hypothetically, but then two minutes into the question they're saying, the United Nations says they've got nukes.
[00:13:57.065 --> 00:13:59.185]  The United Nations says they're going to hit us.
[00:13:59.766 --> 00:14:02.547]  And again, remember, the UN's always being
[00:14:03.428 --> 00:14:07.410]  In every debate, in every argument, it is prima facie that the U.N.
[00:14:07.471 --> 00:14:08.071]  is the boss.
[00:14:08.191 --> 00:14:08.671]  Notice that!
[00:14:08.691 --> 00:14:18.757]  It doesn't matter which Democratic-controlled debates, Republican debates, MSNBC debates, CNN debate, YouTube debate, Fox debate, it's always the U.N.
[00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:19.438]  says!
[00:14:20.338 --> 00:14:21.919]  And then they debate about, well, the U.N.
[00:14:21.979 --> 00:14:22.760]  doesn't say that.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.800]  Oh, yes, the U.N.
[00:14:24.201 --> 00:14:25.481]  does say that.
[00:14:25.862 --> 00:14:30.745]  See how they falsely give you false choices and set up the parameters of the debate?
[00:14:31.005 --> 00:14:32.966]  See, that's how real propaganda works.
[00:14:36.082 --> 00:14:40.205]  They literally craft the paradigm in which you're supposed to contain your thinking.
[00:14:40.465 --> 00:14:41.566]  Get outside the box, folks.
[00:14:41.606 --> 00:14:42.607]  Start looking for this.
[00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:47.390]  But here it is, and then he just comes right out, this little sniveling Fox reporter.
[00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:54.695]  He makes Bill O'Reilly look tame, and just says, why are you taking orders from Al-Qaeda?
[00:14:55.839 --> 00:14:57.660]  And this is what they basically said in this country.
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:07.226]  If you're against the war, you're against anything they say or do, you're against trillions missing from the Pentagon, you're against gay porn stars in the middle of the night at the White House hundreds of times, you're with Al-Qaeda!
[00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.750]  So let's go ahead and roll this.
[00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:18.393]  President Paul, your position on the war is pretty simple.
[00:15:18.874 --> 00:15:19.194]  Get out.
[00:15:20.558 --> 00:15:27.465]  What about, though, trying to minimize the bloodbath that would certainly occur if we pull out in a hurry?
[00:15:28.206 --> 00:15:33.692]  What about protecting the thousands of Iraqis who have staked their lives in backing the U.S.?
[00:15:34.332 --> 00:15:40.759]  And would you leave troops in the region to take out any al-Qaeda camps that are developed after we leave?
[00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:49.823]  The people who say there will be a bloodbath are the ones who said it would be a cakewalk, it would be a slam dunk, and that it would be paid for by oil.
[00:15:50.203 --> 00:15:51.184]  Why believe them?
[00:15:51.444 --> 00:15:53.346]  They've been wrong on everything they've said.
[00:15:53.806 --> 00:16:01.692]  So why not ask the people... Why not ask the people who advise not to go into the region and into the war?
[00:16:02.053 --> 00:16:04.294]  The war has not gone well one bit.
[00:16:04.374 --> 00:16:05.155]  Yes, I would leave.
[00:16:05.635 --> 00:16:06.696]  I would leave completely.
[00:16:07.037 --> 00:16:08.598]  Why leave the troops in the region?
[00:16:08.658 --> 00:16:11.040]  It was the fact that we had troops in Saudi Arabia,
[00:16:11.761 --> 00:16:15.803]  Was one of the three reasons given for the attack on 9-11.
[00:16:16.743 --> 00:16:18.384]  So why leave them in the region?
[00:16:18.884 --> 00:16:21.765]  They don't want our troops on the Arabian Peninsula.
[00:16:21.925 --> 00:16:26.707]  We have no need for our national security to have troops on the Arabian Peninsula.
[00:16:27.087 --> 00:16:33.270]  And going into Iraq and Afghanistan and threatening Iran is the worst thing we can do for our national security.
[00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.111]  I am less safe, the American people are less safe for this.
[00:16:36.431 --> 00:16:38.252]  It's the policy that is wrong.
[00:16:38.712 --> 00:16:45.778]  Tactical movements and shifting troops around and taking in 30 more and reducing by 5, totally irrelevant!
[00:16:46.159 --> 00:16:53.866]  We need a new foreign policy that said we ought to mind our own business, bring our troops home, defend this country, defend our borders...
[00:17:02.671 --> 00:17:12.954]  So Congressman Paul, and I'd like you to take 30 seconds to answer this, you're basically saying that we should take our marching orders from Al-Qaeda if they want us off the Arabian Peninsula, we should leave?
[00:17:17.416 --> 00:17:22.497]  I'm saying we should take our marching orders from our Constitution.
[00:17:22.797 --> 00:17:24.298]  We should not go to war.
[00:17:25.825 --> 00:17:28.087]  We should not go to war without a declaration.
[00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:30.669]  We should not go to war when it's an aggressive war.
[00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:32.670]  This is an aggressive invasion.
[00:17:32.911 --> 00:17:35.313]  We've committed the invasion of this war.
[00:17:35.693 --> 00:17:37.794]  And it's illegal under international law.
[00:17:37.855 --> 00:17:41.397]  That's where I take my marching orders, not from any enemy.
[00:17:48.573 --> 00:18:01.679]  Well, I've analyzed from the video we can see of the crowd, it's thousands, and when it's just about a hundred hand-picked Fox CIA operatives and supporters and cameramen who are off-duty, they can all boo Ron Paul.
[00:18:01.719 --> 00:18:06.401]  But every time they have a debate with a big crowd of people, about 60% are cheering for him.
[00:18:06.441 --> 00:18:12.684]  About 40% are little neocons that think gun control and open borders and doubling the size of the federal government.
[00:18:12.704 --> 00:18:13.965]  By the way, that was in the first four years.
[00:18:14.045 --> 00:18:15.025]  It's now more than doubled.
[00:18:15.065 --> 00:18:16.666]  It's approaching tripling.
[00:18:17.407 --> 00:18:19.088]  About the time Bush leaves.
[00:18:19.949 --> 00:18:21.830]  As if he runs anything anyway, he's a puppet.
[00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.512]  But I just wrote some notes there.
[00:18:28.334 --> 00:18:36.419]  Notice how the pundit, supposedly asking a question, says, well, there's no doubt, it's a fact, there'll be a... it's a fact.
[00:18:37.639 --> 00:18:39.400]  It's a fact the moon's made of cheese.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:46.645]  It's a fact there'll be a bloodbath if we pull out and we don't want to betray the people that we have been fighting with us.
[00:18:48.701 --> 00:18:53.342]  In major Iraqi polls, 60% three years ago hated us.
[00:18:54.023 --> 00:18:54.863]  Now it's over 90%.
[00:18:57.043 --> 00:18:58.384]  Those elections aren't real.
[00:18:59.244 --> 00:19:01.705]  They had that a few years ago and put in some puppet council.
[00:19:03.445 --> 00:19:04.846]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:19:04.866 --> 00:19:06.526]  We don't have real elections here in most cases.
[00:19:06.686 --> 00:19:09.187]  They got one in Iraq and the evidence was no, that it was a fraud.
[00:19:09.467 --> 00:19:11.808]  But, purple fingers, that fools the American people.
[00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:16.689]  So we hear this talk about bloodbath.
[00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:38.635]  When we get back, I will get into claiming that Ron Paul and everybody else in the country basically takes orders from Al Qaeda, and then we'll talk about how it actually does create real terrorists, and several other points that I've got here.
[00:19:38.655 --> 00:19:46.560]  And we've got the next clip from Brett Hume, where the lying and manipulation and propaganda only
[00:19:47.416 --> 00:19:48.458]  Intensifies.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.165]  Big report up on prisonplanet.com covering this.
[00:19:53.428 --> 00:19:54.089]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:54.530]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.343 --> 00:20:04.364]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:20:04.664 --> 00:20:09.586]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:20:09.846 --> 00:20:14.207]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:20:14.488 --> 00:20:23.411]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:27.232]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:20:27.532 --> 00:20:32.557]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:20:32.837 --> 00:20:39.544]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:20:40.054 --> 00:20:40.695]  What about you?
[00:20:41.355 --> 00:20:46.719]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:47.860]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:49.841]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:12.105]  Ted Anderson reminded September 6, 2007, gold 685 20 ounce gold coins can be purchased for 70706, 34880 per half, and 17440 per quarter.
[00:21:13.086 --> 00:21:14.187]  That's 70706, 34880, and 17440.
[00:21:15.748 --> 00:21:21.693]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:21:21.753 --> 00:21:26.057]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yon revolution.
[00:21:26.377 --> 00:21:34.839]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:21:34.879 --> 00:21:37.500]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.600]  Russia, Switzerland and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:21:41.821 --> 00:21:48.202]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[00:21:48.542 --> 00:21:51.664]  Call for the report today.
[00:21:51.684 --> 00:21:52.084]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.104 --> 00:21:55.285]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in the global game of chess.
[00:21:55.365 --> 00:21:55.626]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:55.646 --> 00:21:55.826]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.204 --> 00:22:03.185]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:22:03.445 --> 00:22:06.486]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:22:06.746 --> 00:22:11.528]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:22:11.848 --> 00:22:14.589]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:22:14.829 --> 00:22:19.491]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[00:22:19.791 --> 00:22:21.692]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:22:22.172 --> 00:22:32.115]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[00:22:32.495 --> 00:22:37.176]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:41.077]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[00:22:41.297 --> 00:22:43.437]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[00:22:43.757 --> 00:22:45.918]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[00:22:46.098 --> 00:22:47.900]  We'll even refund the shipping charge!
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.304]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now!
[00:22:51.524 --> 00:22:52.425]  What are you waiting for?
[00:22:52.605 --> 00:22:53.286]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[00:22:53.466 --> 00:22:53.706]  That's 1-888-873-7371.
[00:22:53.746 --> 00:22:53.907]  Today!
[00:23:02.276 --> 00:23:04.318]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:04.959 --> 00:23:13.887]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:14.348 --> 00:23:21.535]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:22.245 --> 00:23:27.751]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:28.231 --> 00:23:39.062]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:39.823 --> 00:23:41.845]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:23:42.385 --> 00:23:45.167]  For more information call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:23:45.207 --> 00:23:45.547]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:24:18.699 --> 00:24:25.003]  Imagine it as a carny at a carnival.
[00:24:25.404 --> 00:24:26.925]  And you stop by one of their booths.
[00:24:28.766 --> 00:24:30.747]  And the whole game is rigged.
[00:24:32.788 --> 00:24:35.190]  But he tries to keep you focused on the pieces.
[00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:41.034]  Whatever the little shell game he's foisting on you is.
[00:24:43.183 --> 00:24:50.927]  And then one of his buddies, two of you play two or three games and lose your money, one of his buddies will walk up behind you and say, hey, I got a way to fix that.
[00:24:52.648 --> 00:24:55.109]  Listen, I'll tell you how to win this game, just bet a few more times.
[00:24:57.871 --> 00:25:00.332]  And that's basically what they do, and Ron Paul makes this point.
[00:25:00.892 --> 00:25:06.575]  For two years now, remember they said we'd be out by Christmas, we'd be there six months, we were going to go in, pull out,
[00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:15.852]  The actual Pentagon plans, though, said be there for at least 20 years, build six permanent bases, one of them is going to hold 3,000 people, the biggest U.S.
[00:25:16.293 --> 00:25:18.293]  base, biggest, quote, U.S.
[00:25:18.353 --> 00:25:19.454]  embassy in the world.
[00:25:19.474 --> 00:25:24.876]  And they said, oh, we're going to break it in three parts and show sectarian warfare.
[00:25:25.176 --> 00:25:26.997]  That's in the Israeli plan, the Pentagon plan.
[00:25:27.297 --> 00:25:33.500]  And see, I told you before the war even started, years later they would roll it out as a new idea, as a fix.
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.301]  And you've been hearing, now for the last year, break it in three parts.
[00:25:37.782 --> 00:25:38.603]  How did I know that?
[00:25:39.303 --> 00:25:40.584]  Folks, I don't have a crystal ball.
[00:25:41.284 --> 00:25:42.325]  They said it!
[00:25:42.705 --> 00:25:44.346]  That's what's so frustrating.
[00:25:48.509 --> 00:25:53.953]  They have one set of policies they teach and they put out to the think tanks and to the elites and they're not even classified.
[00:25:53.973 --> 00:25:55.594]  Because they know you don't read books.
[00:25:55.934 --> 00:25:59.536]  They know you don't know how many continents there are or where the US is on the globe.
[00:25:59.556 --> 00:26:03.899]  A lot of Americans don't even know basic stuff.
[00:26:04.807 --> 00:26:16.393]  And so, their carnival-barking scam, and there's hundreds of them, with this war, is to just keep having a debate about, okay, well, John Warner, he wants 5,000 troops out, and Bush goes, how dare you?
[00:26:16.953 --> 00:26:21.515]  And they have a debate about, do we pull 5,000 out of 160,000 or not?
[00:26:22.095 --> 00:26:23.596]  And so it's a false debate.
[00:26:24.717 --> 00:26:27.238]  And for the last two-plus years, it's debates about,
[00:26:28.007 --> 00:26:30.648]  Give this latest troop buildup a chance.
[00:26:30.908 --> 00:26:32.148]  That started two plus years ago.
[00:26:32.568 --> 00:26:34.169]  And we'll give this new surge a chance.
[00:26:34.189 --> 00:26:35.229]  It started in January.
[00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:37.089]  Oh, the surge is doing well!
[00:26:37.349 --> 00:26:44.711]  Well, the actual numbers show increased deaths and less water treatment and more cholera and more death.
[00:26:45.291 --> 00:26:45.751]  Shut up!
[00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:49.172]  You're just not wanting America to win.
[00:26:50.833 --> 00:26:52.493]  But this isn't America that's doing this.
[00:26:52.533 --> 00:26:53.573]  America's been hijacked.
[00:26:53.853 --> 00:26:56.814]  The people that are running this war are destroying our Republic.
[00:26:58.138 --> 00:26:59.440]  Ah, shut up, liberal!
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:04.166]  And I'm like, hey, I'm not the one that tripled the size of the BATF!
[00:27:04.726 --> 00:27:05.687]  Shut up, liberal!
[00:27:06.288 --> 00:27:07.870]  Shut up, conspiracy theorist!
[00:27:08.511 --> 00:27:11.915]  Hey, this TxDOT document says they're going to put toll roads on the existing roads.
[00:27:12.235 --> 00:27:13.777]  Shut up, conspiracy theorist!
[00:27:13.797 --> 00:27:16.000]  And the actual documents come out yet again.
[00:27:19.065 --> 00:27:26.831]  I mean, it's... I had said four or five years ago that ten years ago they lied a lot, back before the internet could really challenge them and show how they were lying.
[00:27:27.171 --> 00:27:35.178]  Then they, for a while, they tried to spin the truth, but basically tell the truth, and now the last three years, I mean, now I've never seen such lying.
[00:27:35.258 --> 00:27:39.041]  It's just... That is when it comes out of the White House or out of Congress.
[00:27:40.522 --> 00:27:43.925]  It's because then people are over-simple and they say, well, what do you mean?
[00:27:43.945 --> 00:27:45.446]  And you cover the media all the time.
[00:27:46.209 --> 00:27:48.210]  Well, there's all sorts of local reporters telling the truth.
[00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.891]  There's all sorts of alternative media telling the truth.
[00:27:49.911 --> 00:27:52.653]  But I mean, Pentagon, State Department propaganda.
[00:27:52.693 --> 00:27:53.733]  That's what we're talking about here.
[00:27:53.914 --> 00:27:55.054]  The folks that run the country.
[00:27:55.254 --> 00:28:02.659]  The people that are announcing that Congress isn't involved in continuity of government anymore, and that the executive takes its orders from the UN.
[00:28:02.899 --> 00:28:04.700]  That's who we're talking about being liars.
[00:28:06.181 --> 00:28:10.844]  And, I mean, they've just gone into a new world of lying.
[00:28:10.944 --> 00:28:14.586]  I mean, for someone who's informed, it is so
[00:28:16.374 --> 00:28:17.737]  I keep using the term off the chart.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.023]  Because it is just off the scale.
[00:28:21.244 --> 00:28:25.733]  There is nothing to even... It's hard to describe something this big.
[00:28:26.542 --> 00:28:35.829]  And then it's an insult to those of us that are informed to even argue with you average people out there who love to be ignorant, but who will arrogantly argue with us.
[00:28:35.869 --> 00:28:37.250]  Your face looks so dumb.
[00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.872]  What you're saying sounds so stupid.
[00:28:39.192 --> 00:28:40.433]  I don't want to breathe your breath.
[00:28:40.573 --> 00:28:43.835]  I don't want to argue with you on the street with your little piggy eyes.
[00:28:44.256 --> 00:28:45.377]  I mean, frankly, fine!
[00:28:45.397 --> 00:28:46.878]  You want to destroy America?
[00:28:47.098 --> 00:28:48.479]  You want to end the sovereignty?
[00:28:48.659 --> 00:28:49.980]  You want to destroy the currency?
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.443]  Then just get out of my face, you stinking scumbag yuppie!
[00:28:55.561 --> 00:29:07.151]  Go listen to your Sean Hannity and your Rush Limbaugh, or go be a liberal and support Hillary and go to your stupid environmental meetings that have nothing to do with the environment or bankroll by the oil companies.
[00:29:08.052 --> 00:29:08.692]  Just fine!
[00:29:08.732 --> 00:29:09.953]  Just get out of my way!
[00:29:09.973 --> 00:29:16.979]  I mean, it's incredible!
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.741]  It's just not hard stuff to figure out.
[00:29:20.362 --> 00:29:21.583]  And Han Paul said it best.
[00:29:23.621 --> 00:29:32.706]  We come back, we'll play it again where he says, this stuff about 5,000 troops, 30,000 troops, tactical stuff, it's a distraction, it's a diversion, it means nothing!
[00:29:33.046 --> 00:29:34.206]  We don't want the war!
[00:29:35.727 --> 00:29:43.391]  And so they, and it's unconstitutional, and it's bankrupt the country, so they go, okay, okay, well you don't like those wares, let me show you some more, let me show you some more.
[00:29:43.671 --> 00:29:47.713]  And they start talking fast and putting it in our face, I'm just sick of it!
[00:29:48.093 --> 00:29:49.634]  Brent, you and all that scum!
[00:29:51.818 --> 00:29:54.822]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.744 --> 00:29:58.427]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.855 --> 00:30:03.695]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:09.017]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:30:09.177 --> 00:30:10.517]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:30:10.797 --> 00:30:18.979]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:30:19.179 --> 00:30:24.920]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.862]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:30:26.942 --> 00:30:29.084]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:30:29.124 --> 00:30:33.469]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:35.812]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:30:35.872 --> 00:30:43.160]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:30:45.026 --> 00:30:45.546]  Hey Emily!
[00:30:45.566 --> 00:30:46.327]  Wow, you look great!
[00:31:04.224 --> 00:31:05.024]  I feel great.
[00:31:05.264 --> 00:31:07.165]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[00:31:07.585 --> 00:31:07.905]  Really?
[00:31:08.085 --> 00:31:08.546]  What is it?
[00:31:08.666 --> 00:31:09.126]  How does it work?
[00:31:09.246 --> 00:31:16.208]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[00:31:16.528 --> 00:31:18.789]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:31:19.169 --> 00:31:24.291]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:31:24.791 --> 00:31:25.272]  That's it?
[00:31:25.512 --> 00:31:27.094]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:31:27.414 --> 00:31:28.115]  It is easy.
[00:31:28.415 --> 00:31:35.062]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:31:35.342 --> 00:31:36.684]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:31:36.884 --> 00:31:37.665]  That's amazing!
[00:31:37.985 --> 00:31:43.351]  And, the benzenite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:31:43.591 --> 00:31:43.911]  Wow!
[00:31:44.092 --> 00:31:45.153]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[00:31:45.593 --> 00:31:48.594]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[00:31:48.695 --> 00:31:52.576]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[00:31:52.796 --> 00:31:53.257]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[00:31:53.317 --> 00:31:53.537]  That's 800-317-9547.
[00:32:01.471 --> 00:32:03.012]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.
[00:32:03.292 --> 00:32:08.814]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:32:09.274 --> 00:32:17.197]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[00:32:17.717 --> 00:32:21.358]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs.
[00:32:21.678 --> 00:32:25.300]  Two books that combined are over a thousand pages and other information.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.741]  Order now at our website mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[00:32:28.921 --> 00:32:32.902]  That's mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[00:32:33.162 --> 00:32:37.083]  The last word monastery is spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.
[00:32:37.383 --> 00:32:37.864]  Or call us at 1-800-275-1126.
[00:32:37.884 --> 00:32:38.084]  That's 1-800-275-1126.
[00:32:45.306 --> 00:32:46.306]  We don't need no education
[00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:14.553]  We don't need no thought control.
[00:33:14.633 --> 00:33:18.775]  No dark sarcasm in the classroom.
[00:33:18.835 --> 00:33:22.898]  Teach to leave them kids alone.
[00:33:52.693 --> 00:34:00.896]  Watching all those traitors, all those phony conservatives, all that scum, that ninnying, Mitt Romney, all of them.
[00:34:01.976 --> 00:34:05.177]  Like a bunch of hyenas around a lion attacking Ron Paul.
[00:34:07.738 --> 00:34:10.899]  But it backfired on them and showed what pathetic cowards they are.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:12.980]  Blithium and the rest of them.
[00:34:15.089 --> 00:34:16.790]  You can see fear in their eyes now.
[00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:23.412]  Not even the fear of Ron Paul, but what he represents, what he is a signet of, or a standard of.
[00:34:26.833 --> 00:34:36.037]  A symbol of the rising disgust and anger that the true republic and the people that represent it stand for.
[00:34:36.717 --> 00:34:38.538]  We're on to you, trash.
[00:34:39.278 --> 00:34:42.259]  That's why Rush Limbaugh's ratings have plunged more than half.
[00:34:42.759 --> 00:34:44.160]  His website has plunged.
[00:34:45.189 --> 00:34:51.931]  From being one of the biggest websites out there to literally not even hardly being in the ratings, all of them are falling right now.
[00:34:51.991 --> 00:34:55.072]  Alternative media is exploding and rising.
[00:34:56.413 --> 00:34:57.433]  Because the jig's up.
[00:34:57.573 --> 00:34:59.553]  They now know that Hillary's on your payroll.
[00:34:59.573 --> 00:35:01.654]  They now know Hillary's got Fox News behind her.
[00:35:02.074 --> 00:35:03.395]  It's now all come out.
[00:35:03.855 --> 00:35:05.655]  They all know you vacation together.
[00:35:05.735 --> 00:35:07.436]  They know you're all a bunch of scum.
[00:35:08.675 --> 00:35:11.516]  Those reporters are all intermarried, Republicans, Democrats.
[00:35:11.916 --> 00:35:15.437]  Their children go to the same colleges, are on the same rowing team.
[00:35:15.697 --> 00:35:18.818]  They sit around and talk about us with disdain at the beach together.
[00:35:19.078 --> 00:35:21.498]  That's come out in the news and talk about how they want to put us in camps.
[00:35:21.778 --> 00:35:23.099]  That's come out in mainstream news.
[00:35:23.319 --> 00:35:33.421]  Let me just tell all the little chicken-neck millionaire, you know, reporteresses and reporters and the rest of them who go around talking about how they want to take this country down.
[00:35:33.741 --> 00:35:35.542]  Listen to me, you weak trash!
[00:35:36.042 --> 00:35:38.363]  You're not going to get away with killing this country!
[00:35:38.744 --> 00:35:42.126]  You've come awful close, but that just got this nation roused!
[00:35:43.846 --> 00:35:45.808]  I'm just getting more and more sick of them!
[00:35:46.468 --> 00:35:52.251]  There's nothing more disgusting than a traitor who sits there and poses as a defender!
[00:35:57.234 --> 00:36:00.396]  Dan, Paul, Kevin, Joe, we're going to get to all of you coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:36:00.436 --> 00:36:04.598]  I want to finish these Ron Paul clips and I've got some other important information.
[00:36:08.263 --> 00:36:16.226]  Let's go ahead and just play a clip from that first clip where Ron Paul points out that troop movements mean nothing.
[00:36:16.547 --> 00:36:18.227]  That's just a distraction they put in.
[00:36:18.267 --> 00:36:19.088]  Give it more time.
[00:36:19.368 --> 00:36:22.109]  Let us see what this new 5,000 troop withdrawal did.
[00:36:22.369 --> 00:36:24.570]  Let us see what a 20,000 troop increase did.
[00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:29.792]  We'll look at it next year, and then we'll look at it again next year.
[00:36:30.253 --> 00:36:32.113]  They put it into a process.
[00:36:33.954 --> 00:36:35.615]  These are corporate tactics.
[00:36:38.018 --> 00:36:38.518]  Here it is.
[00:36:39.479 --> 00:36:41.320]  It's the policy that is wrong.
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:48.844]  Tactical movements and shifting troops around and taking in 30 more and reducing by five, totally irrelevant.
[00:36:49.204 --> 00:36:56.928]  We need a new foreign policy that said we ought to mind our own business, bring our troops home, defend this country, defend our borders.
[00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:04.172]  Now, now, let's just, and we got another clip coming up here in a few minutes, but I'll talk to Debbie for a couple minutes before we do that.
[00:37:04.452 --> 00:37:07.334]  But I just want to finish up with the points in this clip first.
[00:37:09.605 --> 00:37:21.968]  Ron Paul, every time he comes on this show, out of the gates, no prompting, no pre-interview, says, I'm really afraid that some provocation's going to be staged, or something's going to happen, to let them do what they did.
[00:37:21.988 --> 00:37:24.488]  9-11, let them do what they did.
[00:37:24.508 --> 00:37:27.069]  And he's saying the 9-11 truth.
[00:37:27.669 --> 00:37:29.289]  Hey, I'm with you.
[00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:32.630]  I mean, you want to get down to brass tacks here,
[00:37:33.593 --> 00:37:37.999]  Just like there with Fox, he knows the general public watching.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:43.326]  He's a very intelligent, very intellectual, very informed and well-lived and street-smart man.
[00:37:43.466 --> 00:37:44.828]  That's what true wisdom is.
[00:37:44.868 --> 00:37:45.649]  He has all those.
[00:37:46.751 --> 00:37:50.656]  They don't understand that that's a staged event, moving troops up and down.
[00:37:52.037 --> 00:37:52.717]  He knows that.
[00:37:53.257 --> 00:37:54.498]  Now, I would have said I don't care.
[00:37:54.698 --> 00:37:56.058]  I just speak to those that can understand.
[00:37:56.199 --> 00:37:59.520]  I'm not even worried about, you know, others that don't care or don't understand.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:05.202]  We're in too big a crisis to try to put the general public through boot camp here now in this fight against the New World Order.
[00:38:05.482 --> 00:38:09.323]  We need those that are informed to take action instead of sitting there sucking your thumbs.
[00:38:10.644 --> 00:38:12.104]  I know a lot of you aren't, but some of you are.
[00:38:12.204 --> 00:38:13.165]  You know who I'm talking about.
[00:38:13.245 --> 00:38:14.205]  You know who you are out there.
[00:38:16.886 --> 00:38:21.828]  So he doesn't say this is all stage and a distraction and a way to drag the war out.
[00:38:22.108 --> 00:38:27.229]  He doesn't say, hey, the Pentagon plan is to have it be a quagmire as an excuse to stay there, which it says.
[00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:31.851]  That's too sophisticated for them in soundbite format.
[00:38:32.551 --> 00:38:34.592]  And so he just says it doesn't matter.
[00:38:34.652 --> 00:38:35.732]  The policy's wrong.
[00:38:37.893 --> 00:38:39.593]  He says it's of no significance.
[00:38:40.814 --> 00:38:44.015]  It is literally rearranging deck chairs or
[00:38:45.225 --> 00:38:52.248]  It's like the band playing as the Titanic goes under, or it's like shining silverware as the Titanic's going under.
[00:38:52.328 --> 00:38:54.509]  I mean, it just is worse than pointless.
[00:38:55.709 --> 00:38:56.950]  That's my beef with sports.
[00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:02.552]  Unless you're playing them, or unless you're watching your son or daughter in the game, there really is no point.
[00:39:02.592 --> 00:39:05.533]  It's a way to waste your life away and get upset about things that don't matter.
[00:39:05.753 --> 00:39:13.776]  You have those instincts to get upset about trans-Texas corridors, and about open borders, and about wars, and about vaccines, brain damage, and all the children.
[00:39:17.757 --> 00:39:20.598]  That's the type of issue we need to be very upset about.
[00:39:20.738 --> 00:39:22.658]  And see, my instincts are fully activated.
[00:39:22.738 --> 00:39:24.059]  I know what I'm supposed to be upset about.
[00:39:24.079 --> 00:39:25.419]  I know why I've got these instincts.
[00:39:27.459 --> 00:39:33.821]  I got instincts to stand up for my family and fight to the death if need be because that's what got me here.
[00:39:34.101 --> 00:39:40.783]  My ancestors wouldn't have survived and wouldn't have passed on their genetic complement if they wouldn't have had the will to get down and dirty.
[00:39:44.704 --> 00:39:46.444]  And all of you have got that history.
[00:39:50.069 --> 00:40:00.495]  And you need to realize who you are and let that power rise up in you instead of being these mindless jellyfish that only care about trinkets and baubles and crud that DOESN'T MATTER!
[00:40:05.098 --> 00:40:10.361]  You're not fulfilled because you are obsessed with the world and all of its junk.
[00:40:11.922 --> 00:40:13.583]  Ideas are what matters.
[00:40:14.704 --> 00:40:17.906]  Friendships and loyalty and fealty
[00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:21.600]  And history, and blood, is what matters.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.581]  Blood is what makes the world go around.
[00:40:25.021 --> 00:40:28.882]  Your family, your history, your people, that's what matters.
[00:40:29.142 --> 00:40:33.523]  Your tribe, and we are all in this together, black, white, hispanic, old, young.
[00:40:33.763 --> 00:40:41.225]  We have the new world order waging war against us, and the sooner we figure that out, the sooner we can turn things around.
[00:40:48.186 --> 00:40:52.547]  I mean, to watch the Pentagon knowingly go in there, and they've executed very well.
[00:40:53.787 --> 00:40:56.488]  And see, that's even part of the execution, is falling on their sword.
[00:40:57.888 --> 00:41:01.608]  See, Bush and Clinton, they take the blame for carrying the ball that far.
[00:41:02.009 --> 00:41:03.189]  All the blame's left on them.
[00:41:03.329 --> 00:41:04.769]  Then the new order agenda moves forward.
[00:41:05.089 --> 00:41:09.810]  Bush leaves, carried the ball further than anybody ever has carried it, because they're in the endgame.
[00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:11.690]  They're behind.
[00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:12.830]  They've got to move down the field.
[00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:15.451]  They've got to get ten points on us.
[00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:18.662]  And they've got about two minutes left.
[00:41:20.183 --> 00:41:22.665]  They've got to make a score, make a field goal, and go back down the field.
[00:41:25.327 --> 00:41:27.928]  So they're going for broke Hail Marys all the way!
[00:41:32.812 --> 00:41:34.653]  And if you take the field, we could win this fight.
[00:41:36.774 --> 00:41:37.875]  And it's the same thing in Iraq.
[00:41:37.935 --> 00:41:43.139]  We go in there, we get demonized, it's quote Quagmire, oh the Pentagon's screwed up, they didn't know what they were doing.
[00:41:43.988 --> 00:41:54.492]  They said, break it in three parts, endless sectarian war, and use the crises that unfold to not just stay in Iraq, but spread the conflict, and turn the entire region, quote, into a cauldron.
[00:41:55.472 --> 00:41:56.752]  A fiery cauldron.
[00:41:58.433 --> 00:41:58.933]  And what is it?
[00:41:58.973 --> 00:42:11.658]  A giant black hole, threatening now the edges of it, going into Russia and China, and Iran, and India, and Pakistan, and Syria, and into Eastern Europe, and Georgia, all over.
[00:42:11.738 --> 00:42:12.678]  War drums are beating.
[00:42:14.339 --> 00:42:19.122]  Many, many times more dangerous than the height of the Cold War, most of which was contrived.
[00:42:19.442 --> 00:42:20.283]  This is real.
[00:42:20.583 --> 00:42:23.305]  A giant whirlpool getting bigger and bigger.
[00:42:24.065 --> 00:42:31.049]  You've got Bush and the neocons in there and Israel just conjuring this abomination right up out of the middle of that pit.
[00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:35.072]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:42:35.112 --> 00:42:37.093]  They have executed beautifully.
[00:42:38.425 --> 00:42:46.087]  But see they executed so beautifully they even pose as screwing up and let's fix it just a little longer.
[00:42:47.307 --> 00:42:51.428]  We'll get the troops home and meanwhile they're singing at the same time they're going to attack Iran.
[00:42:51.868 --> 00:42:54.208]  See how the lie is just on the face of it?
[00:42:57.169 --> 00:43:05.511]  It's very cold-blooded and it's it's it's the diabolical wickedness of it and they say on the Isle of Patmos
[00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:35.647]  John the Revelator was just in absolute awe of the beast system as he was being given this vision of the future, and I can almost imagine when he was seeing or thinking, and of course this is a figurative, I'm being literary here, this is an analogy, I'm not likening what I'm saying to that, but I mean to really be able to grasp the beast system, to really see its operations, it's indescribable how huge and how wicked and how built up over time and how mechanized and how it's got precision in its operations.
[00:43:38.266 --> 00:43:40.747]  Makes you wonder at the beast.
[00:43:40.807 --> 00:43:44.228]  You literally just, oh, your mouth's hanging open.
[00:43:45.169 --> 00:43:52.772]  And then you see these cattle-like people in the streets running around, gibbering, and they can hardly talk now, and you know that's the mind control and television.
[00:43:53.072 --> 00:43:54.852]  I mean, we are being destructoed.
[00:43:55.153 --> 00:43:57.033]  We are being destroyed right now.
[00:43:57.954 --> 00:43:58.794]  For lack of knowledge.
[00:43:59.454 --> 00:44:00.175]  Hmm, where'd I hear that?
[00:44:02.275 --> 00:44:03.876]  We perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:44:06.326 --> 00:44:16.494]  And to see someone with that aggressive little glazed neocon look when they smile at you and stick their little tongue out just about a millimeter between their teeth and it's always the same look.
[00:44:16.514 --> 00:44:17.235]  It's like a spirit.
[00:44:17.255 --> 00:44:19.216]  They'll just go, we know what's best.
[00:44:19.456 --> 00:44:20.357]  Okay, liberal.
[00:44:21.398 --> 00:44:22.439]  I'm like, you scum.
[00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:24.020]  They're getting rid of our borders.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.741]  They're destroying our Second Amendment.
[00:44:25.921 --> 00:44:28.223]  They're blowing out the entire government, Treasury.
[00:44:28.743 --> 00:44:29.804]  That's not conservative.
[00:44:30.185 --> 00:44:32.967]  They're just like, yeah, I'm with the system.
[00:44:33.047 --> 00:44:34.248]  I've got power.
[00:44:38.484 --> 00:44:40.525]  They revel in their enslavement.
[00:44:40.785 --> 00:44:43.007]  They revel in their willful ignorance.
[00:44:43.327 --> 00:44:47.890]  They revel in being cowardly scum who've forgotten the face of their fathers.
[00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:50.251]  And that is an abomination.
[00:44:50.271 --> 00:44:55.414]  All right, I'm going to shut up because I know we've got a bunch of calls, a ton of news I haven't even gotten to, tons of North American unions.
[00:44:55.434 --> 00:44:58.316]  I've got like six stories here today that are all incredible.
[00:44:59.176 --> 00:45:00.817]  Just wall-to-wall information.
[00:45:01.698 --> 00:45:02.118]  It's just...
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.103]  I've got this other Ron Paul clip coming up before we go back to your calls.
[00:45:06.143 --> 00:45:08.065]  But right now, Debbie Morrow, I've been holding for 10 minutes.
[00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:09.426]  Debbie, I'm sorry, I'm on a roll here.
[00:45:10.267 --> 00:45:12.850]  And it's always great to talk to you from New Millennium Concepts.
[00:45:15.793 --> 00:45:16.614]  Do we have Debbie there?
[00:45:18.175 --> 00:45:18.596]  I'm here.
[00:45:19.237 --> 00:45:19.897]  Fantastic.
[00:45:20.518 --> 00:45:20.718]  Hi.
[00:45:21.058 --> 00:45:21.379]  You bet.
[00:45:21.439 --> 00:45:22.940]  Debbie, it's good to have you here with us.
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.183]  Look, I'm here talking about the New World Order.
[00:45:26.135 --> 00:45:27.496]  I'm here talking about their system.
[00:45:27.516 --> 00:45:30.860]  We're here talking about the operations they've launched against humanity.
[00:45:32.021 --> 00:45:33.302]  And you're a great sponsor of the show.
[00:45:33.322 --> 00:45:37.907]  You guys help us get the word out internationally on the global shortwave outreach.
[00:45:38.047 --> 00:45:41.270]  And you guys are the best American-made filters.
[00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:42.491]  You're also the British filters.
[00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:44.273]  You're the national distributor of those.
[00:45:47.196 --> 00:45:51.060]  They get wholesaler prices for buying one unit and a free gift on top of it.
[00:45:52.502 --> 00:45:54.464]  I believe it when I say it and it's the truth.
[00:45:54.824 --> 00:45:56.106]  The water is filled.
[00:45:56.266 --> 00:45:59.930]  Some message board was saying I made it up that water's got poison in it.
[00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:07.058]  If you don't think dead bacteria, chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, MBTE, and now all 50 states including Alaska,
[00:46:08.018 --> 00:46:13.139]  Just thousands of toxins, herbicides, pesticides, motor oil, dioxins.
[00:46:13.199 --> 00:46:19.121]  I mean, folks, once you've been drinking truly filtered water, you can't drink tap water anymore!
[00:46:19.421 --> 00:46:21.101]  It's almost like drinking whiskey!
[00:46:21.661 --> 00:46:25.042]  And what's the point, Debbie, of even trying to get people to buy these?
[00:46:25.442 --> 00:46:27.382]  They're insane if they're letting their children!
[00:46:27.542 --> 00:46:30.283]  If you don't care about yourselves, at least care about your children!
[00:46:30.323 --> 00:46:32.783]  Get out of the habit of slurping the tap water!
[00:46:33.084 --> 00:46:34.424]  Debbie, how do they call you?
[00:46:34.444 --> 00:46:35.184]  What should they get?
[00:46:36.039 --> 00:46:49.284]  Um, they can call me at 1-888-803-4438 and we'll go over the different systems that we have and we certainly want to make sure that we take the fluoride out of the kids' drinking water.
[00:46:50.544 --> 00:46:54.406]  But instead it's just for kids, added fluoride all at the stores.
[00:46:55.066 --> 00:46:55.326]  Yep.
[00:46:56.427 --> 00:46:57.147]  Yep, it does.
[00:46:57.927 --> 00:47:04.270]  And so if they give me a call, we can talk about it and we'll get them set up with a good system that'll meet their needs.
[00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:05.030]  Okay, Alex?
[00:47:06.081 --> 00:47:08.741]  And we'll set him up with the Alex Jones specials.
[00:47:09.668 --> 00:47:13.749]  Debbie, tell folks about some of the free gifts they get, and these aren't gimmicks.
[00:47:13.769 --> 00:47:24.613]  They want you to try some of their other great products, so they give it to you with a larger purchase of $199, which is normally $300 by the way, or you spend $249, normally $350.
[00:47:25.173 --> 00:47:33.816]  You get a $35 value sports bottle that doesn't, it only reduces all the poisons and toxins and cuts out all the bacteria, but makes it a lot better.
[00:47:33.836 --> 00:47:35.596]  $600 plus refills of tap water, $130 of the worst swamp water,
[00:47:38.946 --> 00:47:47.094]  You've got the Sheltering in Place DVDs, Prudent Places DVDs, you've got Potassium Iodate, you've got great LED flashlights.
[00:47:47.454 --> 00:47:49.376]  I mean, bottom line, folks,
[00:47:50.234 --> 00:47:52.377]  Well, I just bought another filter a month ago, didn't I, Debbie?
[00:47:52.817 --> 00:47:54.459]  Yes, you did, as a matter of fact.
[00:47:54.539 --> 00:47:55.420]  How many have I bought?
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:56.121]  How many have I bought?
[00:47:56.141 --> 00:47:57.262]  I know it's more than ten over the years.
[00:47:57.482 --> 00:48:02.688]  Oh, I don't even know, and I understand several people in your office purchased Berkeys last month.
[00:48:03.249 --> 00:48:10.037]  They're finally getting in line in their own homes, and, you know, we want to see those Berkeys everywhere, not just, um,
[00:48:11.656 --> 00:48:12.738]  You know, in my house.
[00:48:12.798 --> 00:48:15.943]  We want to swim in everybody's houses so we can all have good water.
[00:48:16.203 --> 00:48:18.587]  Well, even deep wells have been contaminated.
[00:48:18.607 --> 00:48:20.310]  A lot of them are, but quite a few aren't.
[00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:22.814]  Yes, I was reading just recently...
[00:48:24.033 --> 00:48:31.576]  In the world news, different things that talk about deep wells that have contamination in them.
[00:48:31.596 --> 00:48:39.839]  So it's real important, even if you're on well water, you still want to filter your water before you drink it and cook with it.
[00:48:39.859 --> 00:48:41.100]  Look, it's simple.
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:42.741]  Eugenicists run the planet.
[00:48:42.761 --> 00:48:45.041]  They're putting all sorts of stuff we don't even know about in the water.
[00:48:45.602 --> 00:48:50.183]  And I grew up in Dallas and I remember being a child drinking a big glass of water in the morning and I'd always get a headache.
[00:48:50.243 --> 00:48:51.124]  It wasn't placebo.
[00:48:51.944 --> 00:48:52.364]  I don't know.
[00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:14.274]  I think so.
[00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:39.736]  And in the comments section, tell them Alex Jones sent you to get the big discounts and to get the free gift and tell them which of the four or five different free gifts they have.
[00:49:39.956 --> 00:49:52.908]  You get two free gifts when you get the Berkey Light that has a charger in it and LED lights and it's gravity-fed the filter system itself and it has like a life buoy built into it that can do a lot of things with the solar panels and they got a whole bunch of great products.
[00:49:52.928 --> 00:49:53.969]  888-803-4438 or Berkey Water.
[00:49:56.946 --> 00:49:57.967]  Thank you.
[00:50:27.455 --> 00:50:29.936]  You know, and so I was very glad to be put on hold.
[00:50:29.996 --> 00:50:31.017]  Thank you very much.
[00:50:31.137 --> 00:50:32.117]  Debbie, you're a sweetheart.
[00:50:32.197 --> 00:50:33.378]  Great friend of mine for many years.
[00:50:33.418 --> 00:50:33.818]  Take care.
[00:50:34.078 --> 00:50:34.358]  Thanks.
[00:50:34.498 --> 00:50:35.018]  Bye-bye Alex.
[00:50:35.439 --> 00:50:35.799]  You bet.
[00:50:35.819 --> 00:50:37.379]  Yeah, that's the type of sponsors we bring you.
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:38.240]  I believe in gold.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.101]  I believe in guns.
[00:50:40.621 --> 00:50:41.541]  Don't have a gun sponsor.
[00:50:41.561 --> 00:50:41.902]  We should.
[00:50:42.742 --> 00:50:43.802]  I believe in filtered water.
[00:50:43.902 --> 00:50:44.903]  I believe in storable food.
[00:50:44.923 --> 00:50:46.303]  I mean, this is just basic stuff.
[00:50:47.264 --> 00:50:50.105]  I mean, they've handed over continuity of government to the United Nations, folks.
[00:50:51.226 --> 00:50:51.706]  I mean, we're...
[00:50:52.674 --> 00:50:54.074]  It's just gonna get more insane from here.
[00:50:54.555 --> 00:50:56.115]  Who knows how long we'll even be on the air?
[00:50:56.155 --> 00:50:58.096]  I mean, we can't take anything for granted.
[00:51:04.357 --> 00:51:07.538]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:07.878 --> 00:51:09.819]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.179 --> 00:51:17.801]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.522 --> 00:51:25.565]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.965 --> 00:51:37.390]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:41.211]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.671 --> 00:51:43.632]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.932 --> 00:51:47.774]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:02.907 --> 00:52:07.429]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:52:07.749 --> 00:52:11.851]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:52:12.151 --> 00:52:12.691]  We listened.
[00:52:12.991 --> 00:52:17.994]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:52:18.254 --> 00:52:18.734]  We listened.
[00:52:19.134 --> 00:52:22.155]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:52:22.596 --> 00:52:23.136]  We listened.
[00:52:23.596 --> 00:52:27.618]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:52:28.018 --> 00:52:28.519]  We listened.
[00:52:28.859 --> 00:52:34.105]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:52:34.506 --> 00:52:35.867]  Again, we listened.
[00:52:36.228 --> 00:52:37.810]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:43.557]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.641]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:00.302 --> 00:53:05.787]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:53:06.227 --> 00:53:10.451]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:53:10.892 --> 00:53:17.738]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:53:18.178 --> 00:53:24.884]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:53:25.205 --> 00:53:26.826]  There are no reported side effects.
[00:53:27.127 --> 00:53:30.310]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:33.032]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[00:53:47.283 --> 00:53:49.044]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[00:54:10.373 --> 00:54:12.194]  They railed against the crown.
[00:54:14.095 --> 00:54:17.716]  They laid their bodies down.
[00:54:17.836 --> 00:54:26.080]  You don't truly live until you put your body, your soul on the card table of life.
[00:54:40.998 --> 00:54:42.359]  Let me tell you a little secret.
[00:54:44.219 --> 00:54:45.940]  Your life is already on that table.
[00:54:48.221 --> 00:54:52.123]  And when you put your life on the table, you realize it was already there.
[00:54:53.683 --> 00:54:54.864]  And then you're truly alive.
[00:54:56.905 --> 00:54:58.545]  None of us are going to make it out of this alive.
[00:54:59.446 --> 00:55:00.586]  Death's 100%.
[00:55:01.506 --> 00:55:05.048]  But honor and goodness is 100% as well.
[00:55:05.108 --> 00:55:06.448]  And God is real.
[00:55:06.508 --> 00:55:07.469]  God is alive.
[00:55:07.809 --> 00:55:10.050]  And evil will be punished.
[00:55:10.738 --> 00:55:18.526]  I'm going to go to Dan, Paul, Kevin, Joe, and many others as soon as we start the next hour, but I want to finish up with the Ron Paul attack pieces that were just unprecedented.
[00:55:18.546 --> 00:55:20.387]  They said, why do you take orders from Al Qaeda?
[00:55:21.769 --> 00:55:26.333]  That's the level of brainwashing that has now been created.
[00:55:28.644 --> 00:55:43.797]  And then Brett Hume, the CIA operative, the White House operative, well-known, has come out, starts lying and says that the UN says they've got nuclear weapons, they're about to get them, they're going to hit us, they're going to destroy Israel.
[00:55:44.397 --> 00:55:48.120]  Notice he says hypothetical, but then later he starts stating it as if it's fact.
[00:55:48.481 --> 00:55:49.742]  The UN says they've got it.
[00:55:52.904 --> 00:55:56.928]  And most of the public out there must think, oh my God, they've got nukes now?
[00:55:57.668 --> 00:56:03.576]  Remember, 47% of the public still thinks that Saddam has been lying.
[00:56:06.099 --> 00:56:07.260]  So let's go ahead and go into this clip.
[00:56:17.291 --> 00:56:20.934]  Uh, that any of you as president might well end up facing and concerns Iran.
[00:56:21.374 --> 00:56:22.915]  And these are the circumstances.
[00:56:23.496 --> 00:56:25.617]  It's nuclear program has continued to advance... Let's stop right there.
[00:56:26.017 --> 00:56:27.739]  See, they didn't even say hypothetical.
[00:56:27.779 --> 00:56:30.901]  They just said, we think it's quite plausible, we think it's gonna happen.
[00:56:31.301 --> 00:56:34.464]  The guy earlier said everybody knows if we left it'd be a bloodbath.
[00:56:34.724 --> 00:56:38.787]  All the actual major studies say it would reduce everything and end World War III starting.
[00:56:39.207 --> 00:56:40.648]  The bloodbaths are still going on.
[00:56:40.788 --> 00:56:41.749]  It's just all lies.
[00:56:41.989 --> 00:56:43.250]  But, but, I'm sorry, here it is.
[00:56:44.331 --> 00:56:46.712]  ...that any of you as president might well end up facing.
[00:56:46.772 --> 00:56:49.793]  It concerns Iran, and these are the circumstances.
[00:56:50.393 --> 00:56:52.614]  Its nuclear program has continued to advance.
[00:56:53.514 --> 00:56:53.715]  U.N.
[00:56:53.775 --> 00:57:02.198]  weapons inspectors have now saying that it appears that Iran is on the verge of being able to produce and may even be producing nuclear weapons.
[00:57:02.618 --> 00:57:03.998]  Iran has suspended... Stop him!
[00:57:04.178 --> 00:57:04.598]  Stop him!
[00:57:04.999 --> 00:57:05.599]  Back it up again.
[00:57:05.639 --> 00:57:06.819]  You've got... Folks, listen to this.
[00:57:07.499 --> 00:57:11.441]  He doesn't make it clear it's hypothetical, but he lawyerly, with skill,
[00:57:12.259 --> 00:57:17.463]  You can see him concentrating in his lies while he's doing it and then looking down at his script.
[00:57:18.284 --> 00:57:21.066]  Most people wouldn't understand he was saying that this is hypothetical.
[00:57:21.726 --> 00:57:28.871]  He says this is what we think is going to happen, this is very plausible, and then he says the UN is saying they've got nukes that are going to use them.
[00:57:30.573 --> 00:57:33.955]  Now the way that came off is this is being announced to the world!
[00:57:34.836 --> 00:57:36.377]  See, that's how they do it.
[00:57:37.097 --> 00:57:37.758]  Let's go back to it.
[00:57:38.636 --> 00:57:45.339]  I'm now saying that it appears that Iran is on the verge of being able to produce and may even be producing nuclear weapons.
[00:57:45.779 --> 00:57:54.323]  Iran has suspended its cooperation with the UN Nuclear Agency and asked the inspectors to leave the country.
[00:57:54.423 --> 00:58:03.988]  Cross-border incidents in Iraq involving elements of the Revolutionary Guards have continued to increase and are a continuing problem for US forces there and for the Iraqis as well.
[00:58:04.008 --> 00:58:05.749]  The UN Security Council... Stop right there!
[00:58:06.429 --> 00:58:08.330]  The Iranians are not coming across the border.
[00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:11.750]  They're being attacked by number three Al-Qaeda under CIA command.
[00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:13.111]  Public White House announcement.
[00:58:13.431 --> 00:58:16.292]  But see, he just announced a total lie as if it was news.
[00:58:18.092 --> 00:58:20.893]  I mean, we're going to come back, finish the clip, go to your calls.
[00:58:20.913 --> 00:58:21.413]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:21.433 --> 00:58:22.053]  A lot of calls next hour.
[00:58:22.073 --> 00:58:22.713]  A bunch of NAU news.
[00:58:27.077 --> 00:58:30.639]  Huge stacks in front of me, but this Ron Paul situation isn't just about Ron Paul.
[00:58:31.119 --> 00:58:35.501]  It's about how they stage things, how they lie, how they deceive, all the games they play.
[00:58:36.161 --> 00:58:39.322]  I mean, these are major leaguers when it comes to killing America.
[00:58:41.383 --> 00:58:45.965]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.862 --> 00:59:02.024]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.724 --> 00:59:03.525]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.285 --> 00:59:05.206]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.846 --> 00:59:09.568]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.028 --> 00:59:14.150]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.491 --> 00:59:16.851]  I never got to it yesterday.
[00:59:16.871 --> 00:59:23.955]  I want to get into, in the shower, how McDonald's is getting in on the global warming propaganda.
[00:59:25.572 --> 00:59:29.994]  What's happening with Leonardo DiCaprio's new global warming fear-mongering eleventh hour?
[00:59:30.715 --> 00:59:32.816]  They claim global warming is going to cause more heart attacks.
[00:59:32.856 --> 00:59:34.257]  I mean, they're pulling out all the stops.
[00:59:34.917 --> 00:59:39.200]  I want to go over some new North American Union development, but first I want to take a whole parcel of calls.
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:41.821]  We've been talking about Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:59:42.601 --> 00:59:44.983]  Just start it over, and then we'll come back, comment on it, and go to calls.
[00:59:45.914 --> 01:00:05.768]  This is Brent Hume, who takes more time to ask the question, cuts into Ron Paul, other people are interrupting him, not letting him finish his question, they cheated him on time, they lied, this is all hypothetical they're talking about, they don't make that clear, they imply the UN says they've got nukes and are about to use them, and the Iranians are attacking our troops, I mean, it's just all lies!
[01:00:05.808 --> 01:00:06.288]  Here it is!
[01:00:08.029 --> 01:00:14.874]  This round of questions is going to be based on a scenario which we think is quite plausible,
[01:00:15.864 --> 01:00:19.306]  That any of you as president might well end up facing and concerns Iran.
[01:00:19.787 --> 01:00:21.328]  And these are the circumstances.
[01:00:21.928 --> 01:00:24.149]  Its nuclear program has continued to advance.
[01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:33.735]  UN weapons inspectors have now saying that it appears that Iran is on the verge of being able to produce and may even be producing nuclear weapons.
[01:00:34.175 --> 01:00:39.919]  Iran has suspended its cooperation with the UN nuclear agency.
[01:00:40.579 --> 01:00:42.700]  And ask the inspectors to leave the country.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:50.264]  Cross-border incidents in Iraq involving elements of the Revolutionary Guards have continued to increase and are a continuing problem for U.S.
[01:00:50.304 --> 01:00:52.366]  forces there and for the Iraqis as well.
[01:00:52.386 --> 01:00:52.706]  The U.N.
[01:00:52.726 --> 01:01:00.310]  Security Council has imposed some economic sanctions on Iran but has refused to authorize the use of force against that country.
[01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:06.473]  In addition, the threats by Iran's leader against Israel have become more pronounced and more extreme.
[01:01:07.134 --> 01:01:08.054]  What do you do?
[01:01:08.754 --> 01:01:09.555]  Congressman Paul,
[01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:17.259]  One thing I would remember very clearly is the President doesn't have the authority to go to war.
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:19.341]  He goes to the Congress!
[01:01:19.381 --> 01:01:19.961]  So what do you do?
[01:01:20.041 --> 01:01:23.663]  He goes to the Congress and finds out if there's any threat to our national security.
[01:01:24.343 --> 01:01:38.911]  And, thinking back to the 1960s, when I was in the Air Force for five years, and there was a Cold War going on, and the Soviets had 40,000, and we stood them down, and we didn't have to have a nuclear confrontation, I would say that we should go very cautiously.
[01:01:38.991 --> 01:01:40.252]  We should back off.
[01:01:40.332 --> 01:01:42.353]  We should be talking to Iran right now.
[01:01:42.413 --> 01:01:45.755]  We shouldn't be looking for the opportunity to attack them.
[01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:56.605]  They are at the present time, according to the AEIA, cooperating and by the end of the year they're supposed to be willing to reveal all that they are doing.
[01:01:56.905 --> 01:02:05.654]  So instead of looking for this scenario where it is inevitable that we have to attack, I think we ought to be talking about how do you get along?
[01:02:05.994 --> 01:02:15.282]  With some people that are deadly, like the Soviets and the Chinese and the many others, we don't have to resort to war every single time there's a confrontation.
[01:02:15.622 --> 01:02:17.724]  They are not a threat to Israel.
[01:02:17.864 --> 01:02:22.929]  Israel has 200 or 300 nuclear missiles, and they can take care of themselves.
[01:02:22.969 --> 01:02:30.155]  So you shouldn't assume that we have to jump in and go to war, and we certainly shouldn't do it without the consent of the Congress.
[01:02:34.088 --> 01:02:35.829]  Brett Hume, I mean, just looking at him.
[01:02:35.849 --> 01:02:36.670]  Look at Ron Paul.
[01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:39.491]  You can just see him shining light of goodness.
[01:02:39.551 --> 01:02:41.592]  I mean, don't you have discernment, people?
[01:02:42.453 --> 01:02:43.614]  You can tell he's good.
[01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:45.655]  Look at all the Fox News people.
[01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:47.736]  They're all like Emperor Palpatine or something.
[01:02:47.776 --> 01:02:50.778]  I mean, these guys have Hitler aura coming off of them.
[01:02:51.598 --> 01:02:53.960]  You just look at them, not to mention their fruits.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.281]  They're a bunch of scum.
[01:02:57.364 --> 01:03:01.847]  And I'm just so sick of them posing as conservatives, giving conservatives a bad name.
[01:03:02.387 --> 01:03:08.811]  Just like, there's real environmental problems, a list so long it's getting longer by the minute, it's unending.
[01:03:09.971 --> 01:03:14.834]  Instead, we're just gonna have a global push to have global taxes, nothing to do with all the environmental problems we've got.
[01:03:15.475 --> 01:03:16.335]  NOTHING TO DO WITH IT!
[01:03:18.056 --> 01:03:26.281]  I don't like all the frequency pollution, I don't like all the poison in the water, the dioxin, it's in the air, the mercury in the air, all these coal plants.
[01:03:27.566 --> 01:03:28.426]  They're gonna do nothing!
[01:03:28.446 --> 01:03:30.627]  They're taking the restrictions off of them instead!
[01:03:32.027 --> 01:03:37.509]  But don't worry, there'll be a carbon tax, oh yes, that the plants want.
[01:03:38.529 --> 01:03:40.690]  Oh, God forbid we have more carbon dioxide.
[01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.991]  It's better for people, creates more oxygen.
[01:03:43.671 --> 01:03:45.312]  Come back, take your calls, I promise.
[01:03:45.892 --> 01:03:46.912]  Stay with us!
[01:03:47.252 --> 01:03:48.032]  PrisonPlanet.TV!
[01:03:54.759 --> 01:04:03.828]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:04:04.068 --> 01:04:15.318]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:04:15.638 --> 01:04:20.463]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:04:20.683 --> 01:04:20.843]  I think?
[01:04:39.821 --> 01:04:40.141]  We're good.
[01:04:56.642 --> 01:05:02.090]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:02.491 --> 01:05:10.122]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.805 --> 01:05:17.870]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:29.697]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.997 --> 01:05:33.700]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:35.921]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:36.241 --> 01:05:40.084]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.331 --> 01:05:56.292]  Where do you think one of the most toxic places on earth is?
[01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:57.812]  The answer may surprise you.
[01:05:57.992 --> 01:05:58.973]  It's in your body.
[01:05:59.233 --> 01:06:03.054]  The colon is a natural breeding ground for disease-producing germs.
[01:06:03.314 --> 01:06:07.455]  It may not sound like a very appealing subject, but it should not go ignored.

[01:06:41.185 --> 01:06:41.885]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:41.905 --> 01:06:43.386]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.406 --> 01:07:10.367]  Alright, callers online, get ready.
[01:07:10.427 --> 01:07:11.928]  I'm going to you right now.
[01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:14.170]  Dan in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:14.790]  Welcome.
[01:07:16.231 --> 01:07:18.633]  Hey Mr. Jones, thanks for everything that you do.
[01:07:18.713 --> 01:07:20.374]  God bless you and Dr. Paul.
[01:07:20.634 --> 01:07:27.959]  I just wanted to call and inform your listeners about a huge development in the Infowar on Tuesday night.
[01:07:28.759 --> 01:07:32.582]  Dan Auerbacher, a Republican from California, went off
[01:07:33.377 --> 01:08:01.870]  on the uh... new world order you that are specifically he said this is a war between the globalist and the patriots and uh... he was preferring to what's called hr nineteen oh eight this is a bill which threatens to completely destroyed patent protections in the united states oh yeah and uh... so where was or bacher when he said this on the floor of congress uh... this is the last speech of the night on tuesday night and uh... i've never seen so upset and uh... you know usually he's pretty uh...
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:11.086]  You know, he follows the party line, but he's very obviously woken up, and I think that this is a call for everyone to call their congressman.
[01:08:11.166 --> 01:08:12.887]  Well, that's the thing, and I've seen that bill.
[01:08:13.067 --> 01:08:14.328]  Everything's being gutted now.
[01:08:14.508 --> 01:08:15.409]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:08:15.429 --> 01:08:22.434]  I mean, they've changed the pension laws where they can take all the firemen, police, and nurses' pension funds all over the country quietly.
[01:08:22.754 --> 01:08:24.355]  They're just gutting everything.
[01:08:24.415 --> 01:08:31.000]  I've never... Folks, I mean, you can see them literally looting and even pulling... I mean, let's say America was a mansion.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.940]  They're pulling the wallpaper out.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.101]  They're pulling the sinks out.
[01:08:34.121 --> 01:08:35.341]  They're pulling the fixtures out.
[01:08:35.801 --> 01:08:37.221]  I mean, they're even pulling walls out.
[01:08:37.241 --> 01:08:38.562]  They're gutting staircases.
[01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:40.342]  They're pulling wood ornaments out.
[01:08:40.362 --> 01:08:41.943]  They're getting the door frames out.
[01:08:41.983 --> 01:08:43.523]  I mean, they're taking the doors.
[01:08:43.543 --> 01:08:44.543]  They're taking the windows.
[01:08:44.563 --> 01:08:52.645]  They're taking the... I mean, they are gutting, and they're just wild-eyed doing it, looking at us saying, when you wake up, we got lots of cops with machine guns!
[01:08:52.745 --> 01:08:53.205]  Ha ha ha!
[01:08:53.646 --> 01:08:54.386]  I mean, you know, it's...
[01:08:56.230 --> 01:08:57.811]  I don't want to start ranting about it.
[01:08:57.831 --> 01:08:59.272]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:08:59.372 --> 01:09:01.493]  Well, we've got to all call our congressman.
[01:09:01.513 --> 01:09:03.054]  We've got to come to Rohrabacher's aid.
[01:09:03.554 --> 01:09:04.355]  Clearly, he's woke up.
[01:09:04.375 --> 01:09:10.038]  We need to show other people who feel the same way but aren't voting that way because of, you know, intimidation or money.
[01:09:10.178 --> 01:09:12.939]  We need to show them where the power truly lies, and that's with the people.
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:17.482]  And if we all show Rohrabacher and his colleagues that
[01:09:17.942 --> 01:09:19.763]  We're not going to stand for this bill being passed.
[01:09:19.963 --> 01:09:24.566]  I think that things will start going our way, even more just like with the amnesty bill.
[01:09:24.826 --> 01:09:30.570]  Well, I think it's important to let them know that you fully see the illusion and the fraud, and occasionally they'll back off.
[01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:35.553]  I mean, with the amnesty, 90 plus percent they had to back off, but by fiat they're still doing it.
[01:09:35.873 --> 01:09:38.075]  So we won the battle, but we're losing the overall war.
[01:09:38.095 --> 01:09:41.257]  I appreciate your call, but at least now we know that there's a war on.
[01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:42.678]  That's the problem!
[01:09:44.239 --> 01:09:45.520]  A lot of people don't know how dark
[01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:50.319]  The hour is, how late the hour and how dark the situation is.
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:55.423]  I mean, this is, we're in the thick of the battle for our very lives, people.
[01:09:57.044 --> 01:10:05.091]  The crowd running things runs China, they run Russia, they run Europe, and they've killed hundreds of millions, and they want to do it here so bad they can taste it.
[01:10:05.131 --> 01:10:06.492]  They call it a reorganization.
[01:10:08.253 --> 01:10:11.276]  And they do it by just totally wrecking everything first.
[01:10:12.538 --> 01:10:14.879]  And it may not even go to killing us in mass.
[01:10:14.899 --> 01:10:16.399]  They may not be able to ever get away with that.
[01:10:16.419 --> 01:10:17.400]  They certainly are trying.
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:21.701]  But they're definitely going to try something economically, militarily.
[01:10:25.422 --> 01:10:27.102]  I can't think of a worse scenario.
[01:10:27.162 --> 01:10:32.204]  But in that Murphy's Law, if there were going to be sick criminals running things, that's the norm in history.
[01:10:32.264 --> 01:10:33.144]  And sure enough, there are.
[01:10:33.244 --> 01:10:34.305]  And here we are.
[01:10:34.325 --> 01:10:36.645]  At least we're having a debate about it.
[01:10:36.745 --> 01:10:38.186]  Paul in Nebraska, go ahead.
[01:10:39.386 --> 01:10:40.106]  Yes, Alex.
[01:10:40.126 --> 01:10:41.947]  I have a lot of things I want to...
[01:10:42.645 --> 01:10:46.766]  Discuss with you, but I wanted to comment on Ron Paul.
[01:10:47.606 --> 01:10:59.950]  I watched a replay of the debate after I got off work and I wasn't surprised about the attacks on Ron Paul, but I thought he did very, very well in holding his own.
[01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:11.233]  And even after his segment on Hannity and Combs last night, and I applauded him the way he defended himself and went after
[01:11:12.357 --> 01:11:18.201]  Sean Hannity and the propaganda that he was spilling out like he does all the time.
[01:11:18.221 --> 01:11:19.322]  I didn't see that.
[01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:19.923]  What did he say?
[01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:20.763]  We'll find the clip.
[01:11:21.824 --> 01:11:39.757]  It's talking about how Ronald Reagan defended Americans, stared down the Soviet Union, and how the Soviet Union was chanting the death of America.
[01:11:40.789 --> 01:11:45.493]  And which was true, but a lot of people, a lot of countries are.
[01:11:46.033 --> 01:11:49.276]  But they don't have the ability to defend themselves.
[01:11:49.616 --> 01:11:56.341]  They do not have the ability to withstand direct attacks by our military.
[01:11:56.941 --> 01:12:02.866]  Well that's it, I mean our military still has over 10,000 nuclear warheads and delivery systems.
[01:12:03.973 --> 01:12:05.354]  Israel, Ron Paul's wrong.
[01:12:05.394 --> 01:12:07.315]  He's using some ultra-conservative number.
[01:12:07.335 --> 01:12:10.257]  That's what he always does, so he's totally safe.
[01:12:10.818 --> 01:12:12.619]  When I say 400, that's a low number.
[01:12:12.659 --> 01:12:13.139]  He said 300.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.640]  It's more like 800.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:18.743]  That's the numbers coming out of Jane's Weapons.
[01:12:19.123 --> 01:12:21.044]  They've got race-specific bioweapons.
[01:12:21.564 --> 01:12:24.606]  Israel has weapons right now that will kill every human on Earth.
[01:12:24.927 --> 01:12:27.108]  So does the US, so does England, so does Russia.
[01:12:27.988 --> 01:12:29.730]  It's only a matter of time before they get released.
[01:12:29.770 --> 01:12:31.010]  We're just completely fried.
[01:12:32.799 --> 01:12:36.682]  No flesh would be spared if it wasn't for God, and we've got to put our trust in God.
[01:12:37.082 --> 01:12:43.267]  But instead of going to the... Look, people keep saying, we've got to... See, it's the church, it's the devil, it's the end of the world.
[01:12:44.468 --> 01:12:46.409]  I'm not about to send people into these churches.
[01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:52.634]  Most of these churches around here are saying, worship world government, nuke everyone, make Jesus come back by nuking.
[01:12:52.874 --> 01:12:56.277]  There's freaked out cult members chanting, worship Israel.
[01:12:56.317 --> 01:12:57.798]  I mean, it's some freaked out stuff.
[01:12:58.716 --> 01:13:04.998]  And so I don't even know what to say about what things have turned into, but it is definitely crazy.
[01:13:06.278 --> 01:13:19.002]  That's true, and they talked about National ID and how that was, they were saying it was good for Americans to have, and it's like, no, no, no, don't you understand?
[01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:27.144]  This is part of the New World Order, and because I'm a Christian, and I follow its
[01:13:27.842 --> 01:13:32.803]  As best I can, and study the Bible every day.
[01:13:32.823 --> 01:13:35.024]  And people don't understand.
[01:13:35.044 --> 01:13:41.365]  A lot of people don't understand what the battle is and what's going on, like I said, all before.
[01:13:41.705 --> 01:13:42.706]  No, they don't.
[01:13:42.826 --> 01:13:44.206]  And here's an example.
[01:13:47.567 --> 01:13:49.747]  Well, I was thinking of an example when I was listening to you, and I forgot.
[01:13:49.787 --> 01:13:50.588]  I appreciate your call.
[01:13:51.188 --> 01:13:55.989]  See, I used to interrupt him when I had the idea, because then I would have the idea, and then
[01:13:57.576 --> 01:14:04.239]  I would, if I waited, I would go into a new thought and then forget the last idea.
[01:14:05.159 --> 01:14:09.221]  But see, now I try to be nice and not interrupt, so you don't get the information, folks.
[01:14:09.261 --> 01:14:10.241]  But have it your way.
[01:14:10.742 --> 01:14:11.842]  I'm trying not to interrupt anymore.
[01:14:12.402 --> 01:14:15.704]  And you will not get the information, the spontaneous information, ever again, probably.
[01:14:16.324 --> 01:14:16.964]  But so what?
[01:14:19.385 --> 01:14:23.727]  Now I can hardly even operate because I'm trying to grasp what that thought was.
[01:14:24.947 --> 01:14:26.248]  Oh, on the illegal alien issue.
[01:14:27.449 --> 01:14:42.975]  On the illegal alien issue, people listen to their pastors, most of them on the government payroll now, literally, by FEMA and other groups, and then the federal government, the faith-based system initiative, which has been implemented, by the way, by fiat.
[01:14:43.015 --> 01:14:47.276]  It didn't matter if Congress said no, the court said no, Bush said, hey, I'm buying the churches, end of story.
[01:14:48.216 --> 01:14:49.357]  Doesn't violate the First Amendment.
[01:14:50.537 --> 01:14:52.678]  You know, people won't read the First Amendment and find out he's a liar.
[01:14:53.968 --> 01:14:55.549]  But even that's a distraction.
[01:14:55.589 --> 01:14:58.571]  He's a puppet himself, so me even talking about Bush is a distraction.
[01:14:58.811 --> 01:15:00.353]  I mean, that's how deep this stuff goes.
[01:15:02.194 --> 01:15:06.036]  We've got to totally shift our thinking, myself included, to beat these people.
[01:15:08.558 --> 01:15:17.084]  But when they say we need the Real ID Act and federal standardization of driver's license and IDs, and we've got to have passports to travel around the country inside the U.S.
[01:15:17.124 --> 01:15:18.045]  now, which they've announced.
[01:15:18.425 --> 01:15:19.606]  We told you that years ago.
[01:15:19.626 --> 01:15:20.286]  It was in the bill.
[01:15:21.567 --> 01:15:22.448]  Ron Paul told you.
[01:15:24.773 --> 01:15:28.194]  That it was for American citizens to track and trace and control us.
[01:15:28.934 --> 01:15:36.637]  Remember earlier this year, it came out, would have been going on for at least four years, the Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and 800 plus lending groups.
[01:15:36.657 --> 01:15:39.018]  That was the AP headline in January of this year.
[01:15:42.059 --> 01:15:48.561]  I'd just seen it myself in the bank and then read about it a few places in banking journals, but finally it hit and became an actual issue.
[01:15:48.881 --> 01:15:49.721]  Lou Dobbs covered it.
[01:15:50.373 --> 01:16:01.264]  That illegal aliens did not have to have IDs to get bank accounts, then with that they could get welfare, with that they could then get everything!
[01:16:01.965 --> 01:16:14.377]  Housing loans, car loans, and then Homeland Security, it was a big national issue by February, and Homeland Security looked at it, and they had Homeland Security spokesman on Lou Dobbs on their shows, and they said, no, no, this is allowed.
[01:16:15.947 --> 01:16:21.291]  You, as a citizen, have got to have a national ID card and a passport to travel inside the U.S.
[01:16:21.491 --> 01:16:22.992]  to drive down the street, they're claiming.
[01:16:23.212 --> 01:16:25.654]  They've got federal teams out randomly setting the precedent.
[01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:27.735]  That's what Homeland Security is, is federal police.
[01:16:27.896 --> 01:16:28.616]  It's martial law.
[01:16:29.677 --> 01:16:31.878]  It's the Gestapo, literally right out of the textbook.
[01:16:32.619 --> 01:16:33.760]  I mean, even the name of it.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.321]  And they're doing it out in the open on purpose.
[01:16:36.341 --> 01:16:38.623]  This is part of an arrogant flaunting.
[01:16:40.264 --> 01:16:41.305]  This is rubbing it in.
[01:16:41.385 --> 01:16:42.205]  It's what crooks do.
[01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:42.986]  It's what bullies do.
[01:16:44.488 --> 01:16:45.949]  They're very worldly wicked people.
[01:16:46.209 --> 01:16:47.749]  That's one of their Achilles heels.
[01:16:51.811 --> 01:17:09.057]  So, when they give you some line of bull about you gotta have an ID and register to even pick your child up from school, or you've gotta take all these drug tests to have a job, and you've gotta be surveilled and have this ID, just point out and sue them for discrimination that illegal aliens don't have to.
[01:17:10.438 --> 01:17:11.538]  That'll have some effect.
[01:17:13.434 --> 01:17:17.597]  Alright, I only got two calls that segment because that's all they're bringing up such important issues.
[01:17:17.837 --> 01:17:18.517]  Let's go to one more.
[01:17:18.957 --> 01:17:20.158]  Kevin in New York, you're on the air.
[01:17:20.178 --> 01:17:22.499]  I've got a little history for you if we've got time.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:23.160]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:17:24.501 --> 01:17:31.425]  Back in the War of 1812, 1812, there was a battle here in New York on Lake Champlain.
[01:17:31.865 --> 01:17:35.247]  Yeah, the British came in and shelled the city.
[01:17:35.827 --> 01:17:41.871]  And they had the Navy and stuff and they were beaten back, summing it up.
[01:17:42.526 --> 01:17:43.627]  Yes, there wasn't.
[01:17:43.667 --> 01:17:49.412]  The major British flotilla burned New York to the ground and surrounding areas on 9-11.
[01:17:49.432 --> 01:17:52.034]  Now my memory serves, they also attacked New York.
[01:18:06.528 --> 01:18:09.670]  Now, unless my memory's failing, New York was attacked on 9-11.
[01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:10.450]  Yeah.
[01:18:10.711 --> 01:18:12.252]  By the British, it was shelled.
[01:18:12.492 --> 01:18:12.712]  Yeah.
[01:18:12.952 --> 01:18:14.173]  They burned down the White House.
[01:18:14.813 --> 01:18:17.435]  Remember, the first White House was in, uh... New York.
[01:18:17.675 --> 01:18:17.895]  Yeah.
[01:18:19.856 --> 01:18:21.277]  But I thought that was rather interesting.
[01:18:21.297 --> 01:18:22.778]  It happened all on 9-11.
[01:18:23.739 --> 01:18:24.079]  It did.
[01:18:24.099 --> 01:18:26.260]  I mean, my memory remembers that.
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:26.961]  Yeah, you're correct.
[01:18:27.441 --> 01:18:27.781]  Stay there.
[01:18:27.801 --> 01:18:28.422]  I want to hear more.
[01:18:28.482 --> 01:18:29.582]  You certainly have more to add, right?
[01:18:30.203 --> 01:18:31.203]  I've only got one more thing.
[01:18:31.243 --> 01:18:31.844]  Sure, stay there.
[01:18:31.884 --> 01:18:32.884]  I appreciate you holding, Kevin.
[01:18:33.245 --> 01:18:35.186]  Joe, Robert, and others, you're up next, too.
[01:18:36.235 --> 01:18:44.547]  There's so many of you I want to talk to, but your points are all so important, so... It's a Catch-22, like everything else is, an enigma, a paradox.
[01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:47.651]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:18:47.711 --> 01:18:48.493]  PrisonPlanet.TV!
[01:18:53.971 --> 01:18:59.216]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:18:59.336 --> 01:19:07.443]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:19:07.703 --> 01:19:14.749]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:19:14.889 --> 01:19:15.849]  We're good to go!
[01:19:42.114 --> 01:19:42.455]  We're good.
[01:19:54.019 --> 01:20:03.923]  Ted Anderson from Ida, September 6, 2007, gold 685.20, ounce gold coins can be purchased for 70706, 348.80 per half, and 174.40 per quarter.
[01:20:05.444 --> 01:20:06.544]  That's 70706, 348.80, and 174.40.
[01:20:08.105 --> 01:20:14.067]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[01:20:14.127 --> 01:20:16.748]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions,
[01:20:17.068 --> 01:20:19.190]  China threatens nuclear option of dollar sales.
[01:20:40.988 --> 01:20:42.049]  Call for the report today.
[01:20:42.069 --> 01:20:43.751]  800-686-2237.
[01:20:44.472 --> 01:20:47.655]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in the global game of chess.
[01:20:47.735 --> 01:20:48.015]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:48.035 --> 01:20:48.215]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.647 --> 01:20:56.028]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:20:56.549 --> 01:20:58.029]  After a pedicure they look great.
[01:20:58.370 --> 01:21:02.212]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:21:02.652 --> 01:21:04.833]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:21:05.273 --> 01:21:08.615]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:21:09.016 --> 01:21:11.477]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:21:11.977 --> 01:21:13.018]  What's that name again?
[01:21:13.418 --> 01:21:14.599]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:21:14.979 --> 01:21:16.139]  It's CalX.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.421]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:21:18.741 --> 01:21:20.602]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[01:21:21.371 --> 01:21:29.994]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:21:30.434 --> 01:21:36.137]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:21:36.537 --> 01:21:47.661]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:21:48.321 --> 01:21:49.426]  Hey, here's a drugstore.
[01:21:49.767 --> 01:21:50.430]  I'll be right back.
[01:21:50.551 --> 01:21:52.259]  I'm getting some Calix for my heels.
[01:21:53.385 --> 01:21:57.968]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:21:58.368 --> 01:22:01.289]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:04.171]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:22:04.531 --> 01:22:09.354]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:22:09.754 --> 01:22:15.117]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:22:15.417 --> 01:22:18.379]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[01:22:18.559 --> 01:22:19.139]  We're good to go.
[01:22:41.975 --> 01:22:47.176]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:47.516]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:22:47.536 --> 01:22:48.216]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:49.517]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:26.426 --> 01:23:28.107]  All right, let's go back to Kevin in New York.
[01:23:28.167 --> 01:23:30.307]  Kevin, go ahead, sir.
[01:23:30.347 --> 01:23:32.548]  Just a historical quote that I found.
[01:23:33.128 --> 01:23:33.709]  Sure.
[01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:39.791]  It goes to you and all the researchers and the listeners that are getting the word out on different topics.
[01:23:41.031 --> 01:23:48.254]  What we do for ourselves dies with us, but what we do for others lives for eternity.
[01:23:48.274 --> 01:23:51.435]  I love that quote, and that's really true.
[01:23:51.475 --> 01:23:52.055]  Who said that?
[01:23:52.555 --> 01:23:53.235]  Albert Pike.
[01:23:54.496 --> 01:23:54.896]  Really?
[01:23:55.803 --> 01:23:56.644]  Oh my gosh.
[01:23:56.784 --> 01:23:58.265]  I thought you'd like that.
[01:23:58.285 --> 01:24:00.767]  Well, those evil guys say a lot of things that are true, too.
[01:24:01.487 --> 01:24:03.689]  And even a blind pig can find an acorn.
[01:24:03.929 --> 01:24:06.271]  Broken clocks are right twice a day, but that's true.
[01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:11.835]  I thought that was a pretty good complimenting quote for everybody's endeavors, I think.
[01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:13.836]  Absolutely.
[01:24:13.916 --> 01:24:15.937]  I mean, that is a true quote, though.
[01:24:15.957 --> 01:24:16.458]  Say it again?
[01:24:16.478 --> 01:24:20.701]  What we do for ourselves dies with us.
[01:24:21.567 --> 01:24:24.929]  But what we do for others lives for eternity.
[01:24:25.309 --> 01:24:26.229]  Thank you so much.
[01:24:26.690 --> 01:24:28.491]  Well, you know, that's what's so dangerous about the New World Order.
[01:24:28.551 --> 01:24:29.211]  They know that.
[01:24:30.071 --> 01:24:31.732]  The New World Order will work together.
[01:24:32.713 --> 01:24:43.978]  The New World Order will work for future generations, and then they will sit in the seat of power themselves while they're building that larger structure up.
[01:24:44.019 --> 01:24:46.580]  People ask me all the time, well, why
[01:24:47.944 --> 01:24:52.347]  Does the New World Order, you know, why do they try to build this thing when people a hundred years ago knew they'd never see it?
[01:24:53.508 --> 01:24:55.349]  Well, they're already the ruling class.
[01:24:55.389 --> 01:24:57.471]  They're just expanding the current power they have.
[01:24:57.531 --> 01:25:02.334]  And each degree of greater power they get is greater personal power that accrues to them.
[01:25:02.354 --> 01:25:03.395]  And then it's generational.
[01:25:03.875 --> 01:25:06.917]  They pass the power on to their children, their grandchildren, their cousins.
[01:25:07.257 --> 01:25:08.098]  They're intermarried.
[01:25:08.118 --> 01:25:14.202]  I mean, when you get into the Washington and New York and London and the elite of France, the elite of
[01:25:14.953 --> 01:25:15.393]  Germany?
[01:25:16.014 --> 01:25:17.515]  It's a few thousand families.
[01:25:17.575 --> 01:25:18.936]  I mean, they all run together.
[01:25:21.498 --> 01:25:26.862]  And then generationally, it just gets to, we only marry people that were in the political science department of Harvard.
[01:25:28.583 --> 01:25:29.884]  Or Yale, or Georgetown.
[01:25:31.045 --> 01:25:32.126]  And it's just who you know.
[01:25:32.206 --> 01:25:33.046]  I mean, it's the elite.
[01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:33.787]  They run together.
[01:25:33.807 --> 01:25:34.988]  They even kind of look the same.
[01:25:35.788 --> 01:25:43.153]  I mean, you go up in areas of Connecticut where there's the ten million dollar houses, and it's the old money, and places around Austin, you can get in these rich neighborhoods.
[01:25:43.173 --> 01:25:44.675]  These people look pretty much the same.
[01:25:44.715 --> 01:25:50.799]  I mean, it's a... and there's some people that crawl up through it and break in, but I mean, it's a type.
[01:25:53.861 --> 01:25:56.263]  We're literally fighting a criminal gang.
[01:25:57.144 --> 01:25:58.104]  It's like the Mafia.
[01:25:58.705 --> 01:26:00.566]  When you think of the Mafia, we think of Italian Mafia.
[01:26:00.906 --> 01:26:03.068]  That's another masterstroke of their propaganda.
[01:26:04.321 --> 01:26:14.068]  The Italian Mafia is a very small part of global organized crime, but they got a little too big for their britches in the fifties, and so a bunch of movies got made about them, and they got busted down.
[01:26:14.088 --> 01:26:19.912]  I mean, the real mob, folks, is flying around on Air Force One.
[01:26:20.513 --> 01:26:22.794]  The real mob's sitting there at Buckingham Palace.
[01:26:26.117 --> 01:26:29.799]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Arizona.
[01:26:29.839 --> 01:26:30.460]  Joe, go ahead.
[01:26:31.144 --> 01:26:32.546]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:26:32.566 --> 01:26:41.776]  I just wanted to reiterate a little bit more on what you were saying about the debate last night when, you know, people started cheering for Ron Paul.
[01:26:41.816 --> 01:26:46.301]  All of a sudden it just, you know, it sounded like microphones went out and it just sounded like a
[01:26:47.553 --> 01:26:52.278]  Well, let me stop you, because you brought this up, and Paul probably should have added this, but could have, should have, would have.
[01:26:52.499 --> 01:26:56.183]  In hindsight, you know, Paul has better articles than I would, but Paul might want to do another article.
[01:26:56.203 --> 01:26:58.185]  Remember last year when George Bush Sr.
[01:26:58.205 --> 01:27:06.756]  got booed, and one TV station showed the booing, the other showed, I believe it was ESPN, faded the booing down and put in a laugh track of clapping?
[01:27:07.356 --> 01:27:07.656]  Yeah.
[01:27:07.876 --> 01:27:13.237]  Okay, you could hear that last night, and once you've done editing, once you've worked with video and audio, you learn to see it.
[01:27:13.437 --> 01:27:17.718]  And that's another... Paul did cover that, but I think he should have added some of his evidence to that.
[01:27:17.958 --> 01:27:20.138]  You could hear them fade it down.
[01:27:20.598 --> 01:27:22.959]  You could hear them ride the levels.
[01:27:23.419 --> 01:27:25.539]  And again, this is not America, folks!
[01:27:25.579 --> 01:27:27.760]  That's despicable manipulation!
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.200]  Go ahead.
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:34.041]  Yeah, it was just... I mean, just the production of the guys in the studio
[01:27:34.719 --> 01:27:46.028]  Right in the pot like you were saying up and down adding effects to it where when people were booing it sounded like the booing and hissing it sounded like the entire auditorium but it was like they added a chorus and reverb so it
[01:27:46.522 --> 01:27:47.303]  So it echoed out.
[01:27:47.323 --> 01:27:48.804]  Yeah, we should have an article about that.
[01:27:48.844 --> 01:27:52.106]  To me, that's bigger than Hannity lying and saying Ron Paul's cheating.
[01:27:52.466 --> 01:27:57.690]  I mean, that's the worst sportsmanship you can have, that he wins and they say, oh, he cheated, when it's a lie.
[01:27:58.290 --> 01:27:59.050]  That's criminal.
[01:27:59.070 --> 01:28:01.992]  I wanted to go through the TV at some point, Stern.
[01:28:02.072 --> 01:28:07.816]  It was disgusting, just the manipulation of the audio and visual and just everything.
[01:28:07.836 --> 01:28:10.278]  Sean Hannity will go down in history as a Benedict Arnold.
[01:28:10.859 --> 01:28:11.660]  There is no doubt.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:16.384]  He may even go to prison someday, when it comes out how he was on the payroll and everything he's done.
[01:28:17.145 --> 01:28:19.888]  Yeah, I didn't have a big enough puke bucket next to me last night.
[01:28:19.968 --> 01:28:22.530]  He is an enemy of the Republic, period.
[01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:24.612]  He hates this country.
[01:28:25.353 --> 01:28:26.634]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:28:27.134 --> 01:28:28.556]  No, keep up the good fight, Alex.
[01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:30.838]  God bless you, brother, and thanks for everything you do for us.
[01:28:30.918 --> 01:28:32.439]  Thank you for calling in about the debate.
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:36.203]  I mean, really, there's nothing worse than little fake
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:37.721]  Good boys.
[01:28:37.741 --> 01:28:39.924]  I mean, the guy's literally Eddie Haskell.
[01:28:40.264 --> 01:28:41.967]  He is a piece of filth.
[01:28:43.969 --> 01:28:44.910]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.371 --> 01:28:46.973]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.894 --> 01:28:50.577]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.151 --> 01:28:55.992]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:28:56.132 --> 01:29:01.315]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:29:01.495 --> 01:29:02.836]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:29:03.096 --> 01:29:11.280]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:17.223]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:29:17.383 --> 01:29:19.166]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:29:19.246 --> 01:29:21.389]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:29:21.429 --> 01:29:25.775]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:29:25.975 --> 01:29:28.138]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:29:28.178 --> 01:29:34.647]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardio
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:37.880]  I think so.
[01:29:53.826 --> 01:29:56.767]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:29:56.927 --> 01:30:02.128]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:30:02.448 --> 01:30:07.729]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:30:08.169 --> 01:30:09.290]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:09.650 --> 01:30:18.652]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:30:18.972 --> 01:30:20.574]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.

[01:30:55.204 --> 01:31:00.648]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:31:01.048 --> 01:31:05.792]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:31:06.193 --> 01:31:08.815]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:31:09.315 --> 01:31:12.658]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:31:13.476 --> 01:31:17.799]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:31:18.219 --> 01:31:21.421]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:31:22.021 --> 01:31:24.863]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:27.921]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:31:27.941 --> 01:31:30.582]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:31:30.742 --> 01:31:30.802]  U.S.

[01:31:33.304 --> 01:31:34.044]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:31:34.084 --> 01:31:34.864]  Ask for George.
[01:32:06.372 --> 01:32:06.915]  Welcome back!
[01:32:15.544 --> 01:32:22.108]  Alright, I'm going to get back into your calls and I'm going to really try to move fast now.
[01:32:22.128 --> 01:32:22.428]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:22.448 --> 01:32:26.030]  A, did you see the Ron Paul presidential debate last night?
[01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:38.378]  Did you see just the hundreds of lies, literally, the staging events, the fraud, the defamation of his character saying he's a cheater, we're all cheaters, just made up baloney.
[01:32:40.139 --> 01:32:43.461]  I guess it was staged that more than half the audience was clapping for Ron Paul.
[01:32:43.481 --> 01:32:44.902]  You could hear him fade that down.
[01:32:45.828 --> 01:32:54.071]  As they've been caught piping in cheers for George Bush when he's being booed, both junior and senior, and that's been admitted, by the way.
[01:32:56.112 --> 01:32:57.752]  I mean, that's propaganda right there, folks!
[01:32:57.772 --> 01:33:01.394]  That ought to scare everybody in this country that the media's gotten to that point!
[01:33:03.094 --> 01:33:05.735]  Alright, I'm gonna tell you about some sponsors, and we'll get back to your calls on the news.
[01:33:06.636 --> 01:33:08.456]  Uh, Interfood is just a fabulous sponsor.
[01:33:08.476 --> 01:33:09.717]  These guys have been supporting
[01:33:10.342 --> 01:33:10.542]  I think so.
[01:33:28.007 --> 01:33:36.314]  We can simply go to enerfood.com and they've got the inner food, the best green food out there, bar none, at great prices.

[01:34:02.137 --> 01:34:03.337]  Let me give you their number too.
[01:34:03.377 --> 01:34:05.398]  You can get the discount by calling that as well.

[01:34:09.299 --> 01:34:10.199]  866-762-9238 or enterfood.com.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.040]  And on the subject of endgame,
[01:34:23.599 --> 01:34:25.620]  I'd like to hear from listeners if you can get through.
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:28.760]  We've now had two theaters full of people be able to see it.
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:31.321]  Tonight has now sold out online.
[01:34:31.441 --> 01:34:33.021]  They've got a few tickets at the door left.
[01:34:33.061 --> 01:34:35.802]  They offer the hour before so you can still get in.
[01:34:37.302 --> 01:34:42.704]  Even last night there were one or two seats open because the little dirty secret is sometimes people buy tickets and don't show up.
[01:34:44.173 --> 01:34:44.434]  I think so.
[01:35:01.218 --> 01:35:04.601]  I'll be there tonight again to give a speech and take questions and comments at the end.
[01:35:05.022 --> 01:35:07.584]  But if you saw the film, I want to get your honest take on it.
[01:35:07.825 --> 01:35:11.528]  You can email us at Aaron at InfoWars.com with your reviews.
[01:35:11.548 --> 01:35:14.291]  We're going to be putting those reviews up on a page in the next few weeks.
[01:35:14.771 --> 01:35:16.493]  We're building a website just about in-game.
[01:35:16.893 --> 01:35:18.515]  It doesn't even come out until late October.
[01:35:19.896 --> 01:35:21.938]  And I do want to hear from you on that subject.
[01:35:24.033 --> 01:35:44.423]  When it comes to my films, Terror Storm, Final Cut, or 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, or Martial Law, or The Order of Death, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, two films on one disc, you can get those right here on Austin, Texas at the Patriot Bookstore that has hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of titles and videos.
[01:35:45.103 --> 01:35:47.004]  I mean, they've just got such a huge selection.
[01:35:48.010 --> 01:35:48.690]  It's a great show.
[01:36:16.129 --> 01:36:17.630]  That's another project we should do.
[01:36:17.670 --> 01:36:18.931]  We have the staff to get it done.
[01:36:19.972 --> 01:36:22.734]  But I just wanted to plug those fine folks as well.
[01:36:23.975 --> 01:36:35.444]  PrisonPlanet.tv 15 cents a day, you get all 16 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, you can put it on disk or print it out.
[01:36:35.964 --> 01:36:39.147]  Hundreds of my TV shows, we're starting a TV show back up next month.
[01:36:39.607 --> 01:36:43.190]  My in-studio video interviews, we videotape the Sunday show, we post that.
[01:36:44.036 --> 01:36:54.160]  Dozens and dozens and dozens of other films have been authorized to post, like Galen Ross's Madeline Duncan Brown, you know, JFK, Widow of LBJ, Confession.
[01:36:56.861 --> 01:37:00.582]  You can get, um, I don't know, there's just hundreds of things on there.
[01:37:01.062 --> 01:37:03.383]  Fifteen cents a day, and that just pays for the bandwidth.
[01:37:04.003 --> 01:37:09.305]  By the way, we're upgrading it right now, the servers, to a content distribution network to make it even better for you.
[01:37:10.015 --> 01:37:11.196]  Even faster downloads.
[01:37:11.216 --> 01:37:12.676]  We're trying to improve it all the time.
[01:37:13.016 --> 01:37:17.698]  And I want to thank all the members of PrisonPlanet.TV because without it we would be flat broke.
[01:37:17.798 --> 01:37:26.841]  That is what is putting us over the top where we're able to finance what we're doing and not live on ramen noodle like I did in college.
[01:37:27.802 --> 01:37:29.202]  So thank you so much.
[01:37:29.222 --> 01:37:32.123]  I was able to give my staff small raises.
[01:37:32.163 --> 01:37:33.484]  We're able to buy better equipment.
[01:37:33.844 --> 01:37:36.165]  And really it's PrisonPlanet.TV that's doing that.
[01:37:37.346 --> 01:37:41.669]  The films, frankly, do not make their money back, I'll be honest with everybody.
[01:37:41.950 --> 01:37:43.210]  It's a love affair, I don't care.
[01:37:44.111 --> 01:37:48.534]  Because Terror Storm cost over a hundred grand to make and I don't even want to say how much in-game cost.
[01:37:49.195 --> 01:37:58.802]  Buying the footage and clearing it all and jumping through hoops and music and graphics and flying and paying for people in Istanbul and flying to Canada.
[01:37:59.182 --> 01:38:01.904]  Look, if I got into it, it's so much I can't even believe it.
[01:38:02.544 --> 01:38:04.606]  But the bottom line is I'm glad I did it and
[01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:11.452]  You can support us by getting a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, but that isn't even the main reason to do it.
[01:38:11.592 --> 01:38:12.933]  It is a armory.
[01:38:13.093 --> 01:38:15.454]  It is an arsenal of info war weapons.
[01:38:16.054 --> 01:38:20.856]  You can burn them to discs, burn them to DVD, TV shows, special reports, the books, the videos.
[01:38:21.196 --> 01:38:22.817]  Get in there and go hog wild.
[01:38:22.877 --> 01:38:25.658]  Buy a big stack of blank discs and just go nuts.
[01:38:25.798 --> 01:38:26.639]  Start burning them.
[01:38:27.059 --> 01:38:28.920]  And if you don't know how, it's really simple.
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:29.840]  Your neighbor can show you.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:31.441]  You can find applications online.
[01:38:32.101 --> 01:38:34.422]  You can buy some application for a job.
[01:38:34.482 --> 01:38:36.083]  It's little programs that do it.
[01:38:39.665 --> 01:38:42.486]  For those that have the computer savvy, do it.
[01:38:42.667 --> 01:38:43.887]  I mean, do not stop.
[01:38:44.187 --> 01:38:46.528]  Use PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:38:46.649 --> 01:38:47.549]  Go crazy.
[01:38:47.989 --> 01:39:00.495]  They're trying to censor us on MySpace, Dig, C-Span, everywhere else, Google, because we are giving them one hell of a fight.
[01:39:00.576 --> 01:39:02.396]  We are going at their throat.
[01:39:02.697 --> 01:39:05.278]  And they know we're coming for them, and they know they're criminals.
[01:39:06.465 --> 01:39:07.146]  In the New World Order.
[01:39:07.486 --> 01:39:09.728]  And their little minions are trying to protect the status quo.
[01:39:10.049 --> 01:39:12.151]  The status quo is completely insane and evil.
[01:39:12.551 --> 01:39:13.813]  And it's threatening World War III.
[01:39:13.853 --> 01:39:15.114]  We cannot allow this to happen.
[01:39:16.555 --> 01:39:17.577]  Alright, I'm now ranting.
[01:39:17.617 --> 01:39:20.700]  The point is, PrisonPlanet.tv is a fabulous dealer.
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:26.666]  Buy hard copies of the DVDs and books and high quality, digital quality at InfoWars.com and the secure video
[01:39:27.774 --> 01:39:32.159]  And the bookstore shopping cart or call 888-253-3139.
[01:39:32.179 --> 01:39:35.162]  888-253-3139.
[01:39:36.163 --> 01:39:41.729]  Okay, let us now go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:39:41.769 --> 01:39:42.950]  Who's up next here?
[01:39:44.171 --> 01:39:47.355]  Robert in California, then Chris, Cody, Ryan, Glenn and others.
[01:39:47.395 --> 01:39:47.975]  Go ahead, Robert.
[01:39:48.596 --> 01:39:49.277]  How you doing, sir?
[01:39:49.497 --> 01:39:50.398]  Good, thank you for calling.
[01:39:51.031 --> 01:39:53.812]  Okay, a couple things.
[01:39:54.292 --> 01:40:01.455]  One, you notice that also in that scenario in the debate that he did put in that the Republican Guard was giving U.S.
[01:40:01.515 --> 01:40:07.778]  forces trouble, which means to me that they plan to be there for an awful long time.
[01:40:09.011 --> 01:40:09.991]  It's just made up.
[01:40:10.151 --> 01:40:13.892]  The Iranians are standing down on their western border.
[01:40:14.372 --> 01:40:15.933]  They are admittedly under attack.
[01:40:16.013 --> 01:40:16.793]  Three years ago, U.S.
[01:40:17.093 --> 01:40:19.373]  Special Forces were inserted into their country.
[01:40:19.653 --> 01:40:20.754]  That's been on the news.
[01:40:21.054 --> 01:40:26.135]  They're leading, quote, Mujahideen, we've heard that term before, Wahhabist folks.
[01:40:26.615 --> 01:40:32.696]  They're leading, in the east, they're leading true Taliban groups against the Iranian government.
[01:40:33.016 --> 01:40:35.277]  In the west, they're leading Wahhabists out of
[01:40:37.205 --> 01:40:58.523]  out of Saudi Arabia and Iraq against them and then what three months ago the White House announced that they are funding quote insurgents against them and then you look at the commander of the big five groups and it's the number three listed by the FBI and Al Qaeda I mean it's Al Qaeda publicly working for our dirtbag government these hijackers
[01:40:59.289 --> 01:41:05.675]  And then they've got the nerve to sit up there on Fox News, that piece of trash, that fake... I mean, he is a piece of filth!
[01:41:06.055 --> 01:41:13.302]  He sits up there knowing he's lying, while our government runs Al Qaeda, as usual, against the Iranians, lying about him!
[01:41:13.482 --> 01:41:14.643]  I mean, that is too rich!
[01:41:14.703 --> 01:41:15.644]  Is it not too rich?
[01:41:16.461 --> 01:41:25.265]  Oh, it's very rich, but even when they come up with these scenarios, they show that we're going to be involved in this for a very long time.
[01:41:26.545 --> 01:41:34.889]  The other thing is, you stepped up to the plate, and that's what I notice.
[01:41:34.989 --> 01:41:37.930]  Sometimes I hear when people are calling you a leader, and you are a leader.
[01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:42.072]  You exude that presence.
[01:41:42.824 --> 01:41:43.264]  Well here's the deal.
[01:41:43.284 --> 01:41:44.185]  I mean I understand history a little bit.
[01:41:56.227 --> 01:42:03.694]  And I am an aggressive person and I know who the enemy is, but I'm trying to lead by getting other people to activate and be leaders.
[01:42:03.754 --> 01:42:05.676]  And I try to build up other talk shows.
[01:42:05.736 --> 01:42:07.297]  I try to build up other organizations.
[01:42:07.998 --> 01:42:13.703]  Nine times out of ten, they're so mentally ill and so modern American, they don't even understand allegiance.
[01:42:13.723 --> 01:42:15.164]  They don't understand camaraderie.
[01:42:15.524 --> 01:42:24.447]  They don't understand people working together and so they think, oh I'll just stab Alex in the back and I'll be the big cheese.
[01:42:24.747 --> 01:42:26.548]  They don't know it's a responsibility.
[01:42:26.808 --> 01:42:27.868]  It's a lot of hard work.
[01:42:27.948 --> 01:42:30.589]  It's not fun at the end of the day.
[01:42:31.049 --> 01:42:36.191]  And so I just have to abandon them as I move forward trying to find people who want to be leaders.
[01:42:36.651 --> 01:42:49.470]  In this fight, we need to energize each other and create other leaderless resistance all over the country and lots of little and medium-sized groups that are following a basic manifesto of liberty and freedom.
[01:42:50.203 --> 01:42:58.926]  I mean, sure, I could start some organization and have chapters in every town and try to get people doing something like that, and that might be effective.
[01:42:59.346 --> 01:43:02.788]  But overall, I really think that'd be the last straw if I did that.
[01:43:02.828 --> 01:43:07.189]  They'd probably come after me, because that's a weakness as soon as you do that.
[01:43:07.609 --> 01:43:18.413]  But having thousands of groups just coordinated by their basic understanding of liberty and freedom, but not getting any central order, it's like an organism that has thousands of brains and thousands of hearts.
[01:43:18.754 --> 01:43:19.694]  You cannot kill it.
[01:43:20.374 --> 01:43:22.576]  And it's kind of like the internet.
[01:43:23.117 --> 01:43:25.258]  It has so many nodes and so many connections.
[01:43:25.318 --> 01:43:27.820]  It's designed to be hard to kill.
[01:43:28.781 --> 01:43:33.145]  That's what we need and that's what's actually developed and what's been created.
[01:43:34.986 --> 01:43:36.788]  It is a great responsibility to be a leader.
[01:43:40.471 --> 01:43:42.953]  Look, man, there's a lot of things I want to do.
[01:43:42.993 --> 01:43:46.336]  The problem is there's so many flakes and so many people that don't recognize
[01:43:47.626 --> 01:43:51.148]  Even my basic ideas I have that I know will work for this movement.
[01:43:52.069 --> 01:43:58.953]  And so, if I spent all my time trying to make people do what I said, I wouldn't even have time to even put out my information.
[01:43:59.954 --> 01:44:07.118]  That's true, and a lot of times it takes a little bit of humility to accept somebody else's leadership.
[01:44:07.759 --> 01:44:11.261]  You know, it's the thing, I think you hit the nail on the head.
[01:44:11.281 --> 01:44:13.342]  Too many people are out for their own selves.
[01:44:13.931 --> 01:44:21.617]  Much like, you know, Saul was after David's anointing, but he couldn't get it because it wasn't given to him.
[01:44:22.017 --> 01:44:36.208]  But his son, Jonathan, understood that David had something that was true and rich, and that's why they loved each other as one soul, not in this perverted way, as they might put a spin on it, but as something whole.
[01:44:36.228 --> 01:44:37.949]  Yeah, they were brotherly love.
[01:44:38.539 --> 01:44:55.126]  Right, and you know, there was like one scene where Jonathan gave him his own cloaks and his own thing because he recognized that he was next in line as the secession and so he was given his princely garb as a token of this is what I see coming, forthcoming.
[01:44:56.066 --> 01:45:04.250]  And so a lot of people don't recognize that and other people, and it is, it's sort of the egotistical maniac who also doesn't feel good about himself.
[01:45:04.650 --> 01:45:07.311]  The only way he can feel good about himself is to put somebody else down.
[01:45:08.027 --> 01:45:09.008]  Or steal his ideas.
[01:45:10.008 --> 01:45:10.529]  Absolutely.
[01:45:10.569 --> 01:45:11.569]  I appreciate your call.
[01:45:12.110 --> 01:45:13.170]  And that's the great thing though.
[01:45:13.190 --> 01:45:18.714]  People revel in thinking they've stolen ideas that I've come up with of things I do.
[01:45:18.894 --> 01:45:19.514]  I don't care.
[01:45:20.335 --> 01:45:24.117]  I hope everybody takes everything I do and I hope they duplicate it and make it better.
[01:45:24.617 --> 01:45:27.339]  Because Lord knows I don't have all the answers and I'm not the best at this.
[01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:37.425]  Frankly, I wish that I was a farmer and just had ten children and was out there in the beautiful outdoors all day.
[01:45:38.726 --> 01:45:40.987]  I mean, that's what I like to do.
[01:45:43.907 --> 01:45:45.068]  Or a carpenter.
[01:45:45.748 --> 01:45:47.268]  I mean, I like doing things like that.
[01:45:47.468 --> 01:45:55.150]  I do not like having to stomp around and fight with people and have mindless police come over and tell me I can't videotape in America.
[01:45:55.570 --> 01:45:56.970]  It tears my heart out when they do it.
[01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.851]  I feel sorry for them.
[01:45:57.871 --> 01:46:02.012]  I look in their dim little eyes and realize how destroyed they are.
[01:46:04.252 --> 01:46:06.633]  At the same time, that's the way the world is.
[01:46:06.673 --> 01:46:07.633]  The world's very wicked.
[01:46:09.033 --> 01:46:10.634]  And there's all these people who want to be leaders.
[01:46:10.674 --> 01:46:12.235]  They do anything to be leaders.
[01:46:12.255 --> 01:46:18.238]  They do anything to have newspaper reporters at their office every day and TV crews at their office every week.
[01:46:18.998 --> 01:46:22.440]  And really, once you actually have that happen, you find out it's just a big headache.
[01:46:23.041 --> 01:46:25.562]  And it just makes people hate you more that you're getting attention.
[01:46:25.862 --> 01:46:36.688]  Because in this sick Madison Avenue society, they think that it's somehow fun and wonderful and like another universe.
[01:46:38.019 --> 01:46:47.605]  Oh, if you're in a movie, or you make movies, or you're a rock and roll star, or you're the weatherman, you know, it must be wonderful!
[01:46:47.645 --> 01:46:49.967]  There must be... people know who you are!
[01:46:50.447 --> 01:46:51.868]  It means nothing!
[01:46:55.770 --> 01:47:02.655]  But a lot of people in this movement who want to be leaders, and boy, there's quite a few of them, you can hear them trying so hard,
[01:47:03.673 --> 01:47:18.737]  If they would actually try to do the work in the fight against the New World Order, and if that was their goal, and if that was what actually drove them, then they would have the success in the fight against the New World Order, and then they would have people follow them.
[01:47:19.997 --> 01:47:24.859]  Which is not... Again, for the right type of person, that isn't fun.
[01:47:25.439 --> 01:47:32.881]  For the egomaniacs in government, and the worldly people, like Governor Rick Perry, or George Bush, or Hillary Clinton, they love it.
[01:47:34.386 --> 01:47:40.912]  They revel in yelling the balls at the White House and being called Knight Commander of the Order of the Garter.
[01:47:41.512 --> 01:47:49.019]  And we've got this video of Colin Powell just reveling and announcing his title.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:55.385]  I don't want to put on a black outfit and a bunch of medals and walk around and have people look at me.
[01:47:55.425 --> 01:47:58.587]  I mean, I'm sorry, it just doesn't float my boat.
[01:47:59.548 --> 01:48:00.349]  I want to be left alone.
[01:48:01.863 --> 01:48:08.445]  But we have to realize that there is the people who want to be left alone and live their lives and just have a family and have love.
[01:48:09.685 --> 01:48:14.827]  And sit there and read a book and pet your dog and pet your Boston Terrier and sit in front of a fire.
[01:48:16.427 --> 01:48:20.248]  Or go elk hunting in Colorado and get up at 5am and ride horses up a mountain.
[01:48:20.528 --> 01:48:22.129]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff I want to do.
[01:48:25.271 --> 01:48:30.632]  Or haul out a big telescope, my dad's got it, you know, out into the countryside and look at Jupiter and Saturn.
[01:48:30.912 --> 01:48:32.052]  I mean, that's what I'm into.
[01:48:36.693 --> 01:48:40.274]  And that gets back into Madison Avenue.
[01:48:40.334 --> 01:48:45.435]  They make you feel inadequate, and then they hold up these symbols, and if you had these, you'd be adequate.
[01:48:46.115 --> 01:48:51.896]  If you looked like Jessica Simpson, if you're a woman,
[01:48:52.711 --> 01:48:55.772]  Then you'd be fulfilled, but until you do, you won't be.
[01:48:56.152 --> 01:49:08.816]  And then you just live your short life out and never are even happy because you're so busy being insecure and you're always chasing phantoms that are being offered to you by the media and by the culture.
[01:49:10.117 --> 01:49:13.898]  All there to make you feel inadequate so they can not even sell you something.
[01:49:13.938 --> 01:49:15.099]  That's only a small part of it.
[01:49:15.259 --> 01:49:16.359]  That's the bait on the hook.
[01:49:18.337 --> 01:49:20.758]  The establishment doesn't even care about that.
[01:49:20.818 --> 01:49:25.539]  The point is they just want you diverted and distracted.
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:32.241]  But I tell you, there are billions of good people on this planet.
[01:49:33.621 --> 01:49:34.862]  They're just not activated.
[01:49:35.182 --> 01:49:36.322]  They're not aware of the threat.
[01:49:36.342 --> 01:49:37.203]  They're not focused.
[01:49:37.223 --> 01:49:38.143]  They're not engaged.
[01:49:38.543 --> 01:49:40.684]  And all we have to do is unlock their minds.
[01:49:41.124 --> 01:49:42.104]  Take the blinders off.
[01:49:43.485 --> 01:49:45.867]  Raise them up and turn them loose.
[01:49:46.027 --> 01:49:51.530]  That's what I've always felt my calling is, in my soul, is to activate others.
[01:49:52.491 --> 01:50:02.317]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.677 --> 01:50:10.282]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.013 --> 01:50:18.056]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.456 --> 01:50:29.901]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.181 --> 01:50:33.683]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.143 --> 01:50:36.124]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.424 --> 01:50:40.266]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:54.623 --> 01:52:55.303]  We're good.
[01:53:10.326 --> 01:53:12.607]  I am the man of constant sorrow.
[01:53:12.747 --> 01:53:20.768]  I've seen trouble all my days.
[01:53:20.848 --> 01:53:27.269]  I'm a bit fared well to old Kentucky.
[01:53:35.583 --> 01:53:41.484]  Yeah, it's hard to shut down this song.
[01:53:41.704 --> 01:53:45.705]  It's just good for the soul, isn't it?
[01:54:04.448 --> 01:54:28.993]  Six long years I've been in trouble No pleasure here on earth I find For in this world I'm bound to ramble I have no friends to help me now He has no friends to help him
[01:54:34.315 --> 01:54:34.896]  Welcome back.
[01:54:34.956 --> 01:54:36.076]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:54:36.096 --> 01:54:37.057]  I'm going to keep taking your calls.
[01:54:37.077 --> 01:54:38.198]  Richard Gage is coming up.
[01:54:38.298 --> 01:54:41.460]  New developments up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:42.001 --> 01:54:46.024]  Headline CBS anchors said WTC7 collapsed resembled demolition.
[01:54:47.145 --> 01:54:51.168]  And that's just one more to hundreds, but we'll go into that info.
[01:54:51.248 --> 01:54:55.051]  Right now, let's go to Chris in Florida, then Cody, Ryan, Glenn.
[01:54:55.091 --> 01:54:55.931]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:54:56.992 --> 01:55:03.537]  I got a question for you, but first a few points on how Ron Paul is the frontrunner.
[01:55:04.353 --> 01:55:16.845]  Uh, you check out Alexa, you can see that he's way ahead of all the other campaign websites, um, followed by Mitt Romney, way down, uh, Mitt Romney, Fred Thompson.
[01:55:17.829 --> 01:55:22.854]  Rudy, then McCain, and then San Credo and Huckabee.
[01:55:22.914 --> 01:55:43.272]  They've had, what, 15 different straw polls, I was counting them up this morning, maybe one or two more, or maybe one less, but 15 or so straw polls, he has won all of those but three, and he's come in second and third place in the others, and then fifth and one, and then let me expand on that, he has more MySpace friends than all other
[01:55:44.453 --> 01:55:45.953]  40,000 Republicans combined.
[01:55:46.214 --> 01:55:50.997]  He's won every major poll but a Fox News poll he was winning until they closed the poll.
[01:55:51.037 --> 01:55:53.178]  Then he came in second place.
[01:55:53.298 --> 01:55:58.961]  He has more web traffic than all the Republican candidates' websites together.
[01:55:59.282 --> 01:56:00.402]  And the list goes on and on.
[01:56:00.622 --> 01:56:07.867]  And then at that deal in New Hampshire, the Fox debate, second Fox debate, there are thousands of people in there.
[01:56:07.927 --> 01:56:09.488]  More than half are clapping for him.
[01:56:09.668 --> 01:56:11.509]  There's evidence right there, prima facie.
[01:56:11.829 --> 01:56:12.710]  It just goes on and on.
[01:56:14.042 --> 01:56:22.529]  Absolutely, and he just broke 40,000 members for all his meetup.com groups and all the others together are about 200.
[01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:33.598]  And as you mentioned the straw polls, I'm just looking at all these different indicators, and not just in my community, all the signs that there aren't any signs for Hillary.
[01:56:33.618 --> 01:56:44.527]  Las Vegas has looked at it, and they have to be right because it's betting, and they said, look, if he wants to get the nomination, he can beat Hillary, he's the only one that can beat Hillary, and that's why the Republicans in Fox aren't going to let him.
[01:56:44.787 --> 01:56:48.270]  She's the one, she's going to get the baton, Rupert Murdoch's behind her,
[01:56:48.930 --> 01:56:52.855]  And that's just the end of it, and they're going to cheat and do whatever they have to to make sure he doesn't win.
[01:56:53.155 --> 01:56:56.859]  We have to, though, put in the good fight and at least show everybody how it's a fraud.
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:10.514]  Well, as you pointed out, Rupert Murdoch at the Davos Switzerland World Economic Forum this past January, as you have on your site, where he admitted to trying to push the Bush administration's agenda in the Middle East.
[01:57:11.121 --> 01:57:14.603]  And of course he tries to downplay that by saying he hasn't been very successful.
[01:57:15.064 --> 01:57:20.768]  But anybody who follows that Fox News agenda is following the Bush administration agenda.
[01:57:21.288 --> 01:57:27.252]  So I just need to point that out to people that, you know, these neo-cons or these populists... Stay there!
[01:57:27.272 --> 01:57:29.173]  I want you to finish up, then we'll get to everybody else.
[01:57:29.533 --> 01:57:30.714]  And Richard Gage is coming up.
[01:57:30.734 --> 01:57:31.214]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.396 --> 01:57:38.279]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.517 --> 01:57:50.158]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.819 --> 01:57:51.880]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.601 --> 01:57:53.702]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.363 --> 01:57:55.184]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.925 --> 01:57:56.826]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.846 --> 01:58:01.292]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.693 --> 01:58:05.738]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.879 --> 01:58:11.540]  Alright, I got global warming hoax news stacked up at the rafters.
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:13.021]  I haven't even gotten to in two days.
[01:58:13.101 --> 01:58:15.141]  I'm gonna at least blurb that and cover it some.
[01:58:15.481 --> 01:58:16.402]  Play a clip coming up.
[01:58:16.462 --> 01:58:18.782]  Richard Gage is popping in for about 20 minutes.
[01:58:19.043 --> 01:58:20.783]  Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[01:58:21.103 --> 01:58:22.704]  New developments there, new film out.
[01:58:23.104 --> 01:58:24.684]  We're trying to get to all your calls right now.
[01:58:24.724 --> 01:58:25.364]  Let's go back to it.
[01:58:25.404 --> 01:58:26.825]  Chris in Florida, finish up your point.
[01:58:27.905 --> 01:58:32.667]  Well, also about Ron Paul, that he says that we need to pull out of the Middle East.
[01:58:32.707 --> 01:58:36.868]  I don't hear any other candidates talking about that, and I don't hear any other candidates talking about
[01:58:38.302 --> 01:58:46.806]  Well, that's why it's backfiring on them, is to have all these cowards ganging up, the pundits asking the question, saying, why are you with Al-Qaeda?
[01:58:46.826 --> 01:58:49.667]  I mean, they actually said that.
[01:58:49.767 --> 01:58:51.508]  It shows what trash they are.
[01:58:51.808 --> 01:58:56.111]  Everybody knows when somebody's being ganged up on, and everybody roots for the underdog.
[01:58:56.551 --> 01:58:57.872]  I mean, it's pathetic!
[01:58:58.152 --> 01:59:01.533]  They stack the deck to Kingdom Come, and they still can't win.
[01:59:02.876 --> 01:59:20.387]  And I have a question about, since we pretend to be engaged in diplomacy, and this administration does, with regards to Iran, and the same thing happened in the... You know, unfortunately, your phone's cutting out.
[01:59:20.407 --> 01:59:21.128]  I'm going to let you go.
[01:59:21.208 --> 01:59:22.849]  Call me back tomorrow and you can ask the question.
[01:59:22.869 --> 01:59:24.730]  I'm sorry, your phone's cutting out there, Robert.
[01:59:25.530 --> 01:59:27.692]  Chris in... We just talked to Chris in Florida.
[01:59:27.732 --> 01:59:28.372]  That was Chris.
[01:59:28.732 --> 01:59:30.393]  Well, let's talk to Cody in Texas.
[01:59:30.433 --> 01:59:31.274]  Cody, thanks for holding.
[01:59:32.099 --> 01:59:32.879]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:59:33.159 --> 01:59:33.679]  Thanks for calling.
[01:59:33.699 --> 01:59:34.239]  What's on your mind?
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:36.180]  First of all, I want to say you're a great patron.
[01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:37.040]  I have all your DVDs.
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:39.161]  I've been listening to you for two years now.
[01:59:39.201 --> 01:59:39.801]  You are awesome.
[01:59:40.261 --> 01:59:41.381]  And, uh, you woke me up.
[01:59:41.401 --> 01:59:42.121]  I just want to say that.
[01:59:43.061 --> 01:59:43.902]  Well, I appreciate you.
[01:59:43.942 --> 01:59:48.062]  Look, I'm just, look, a pack of criminals said they were coming to take my freedom, destroy my country.
[01:59:48.402 --> 01:59:49.003]  I'm fighting them.
[01:59:49.063 --> 01:59:51.463]  I don't deserve any, any praise, my friend.
[01:59:51.543 --> 01:59:54.504]  I praise you for being involved and caring.
[01:59:54.564 --> 01:59:54.924]  Thank you.
[01:59:56.124 --> 01:59:56.484]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:56.944 --> 01:59:57.965]  Uh, all right.
[01:59:58.005 --> 02:00:00.065]  July 4th, me and my friends got together and we, uh,
[02:00:00.970 --> 02:00:06.912]  We marched against the New World Order, against Bush, and against them taking away our freedoms.
[02:00:07.172 --> 02:00:09.253]  I live in Van, Texas, up here in East Texas.
[02:00:09.573 --> 02:00:10.633]  And we marched down Highway 69.
[02:00:10.873 --> 02:00:11.814]  I don't know if you know where that is.
[02:00:12.354 --> 02:00:17.336]  But basically we walked down and we stood across from the police station with our signs and everything.
[02:00:17.996 --> 02:00:21.397]  And they stood there and looked at us for about 30 minutes, the cops.
[02:00:21.957 --> 02:00:27.579]  And then one of them came out and walked across the street and basically threatened to throw us in jail and give us a citation.
[02:00:28.277 --> 02:00:30.942]  If we didn't leave, basically, and quit protesting.
[02:00:31.043 --> 02:00:32.205]  Yeah, see, that's America!
[02:00:32.585 --> 02:00:36.813]  In the middle of nowhere, in a country town, did you leave when he told you that America was dead?
[02:00:39.133 --> 02:00:43.175]  We actually marched back to where we were, but we stayed on the street and everything.
[02:00:43.215 --> 02:00:51.680]  But see, right there, he would have been a true American and shown that he wasn't with the New World Order if they'd have come out and maybe waved at you or just left you alone.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.421]  But no, they had to come kill the country.
[02:00:54.621 --> 02:00:59.884]  They had to come stab my beloved republic, your beloved country, directly in the heart, yet again!
[02:00:59.904 --> 02:01:01.445]  I am so sick of it!
[02:01:01.625 --> 02:01:02.806]  And that's what I'm tired of!
[02:01:03.286 --> 02:01:04.387]  I mean, I'm tired of it!
[02:01:04.647 --> 02:01:07.868]  I'm tired of these dimwits thinking that they can just go... Look!
[02:01:08.529 --> 02:01:19.534]  Don't you know that... I know the TV told you that there's no protesting or marching or holding signs aloud anymore and that we're all in the military barracks now and you're back in the Corps giving orders to recruits.
[02:01:19.754 --> 02:01:22.776]  We're not your recruits and we're not your slaves, Bubba.
[02:01:23.836 --> 02:01:25.177]  Well, that's a disgusting story.
[02:01:26.618 --> 02:01:29.399]  I wish you'd add video of it and put that punk up on television.
[02:01:30.346 --> 02:01:45.597]  Well, this Tuesday, September 11th, we're marching down the same highway, doing the same exact thing, and, uh... This time, you be polite, you videotape him and say, it's our First Amendment, we're not blocking any traffic or causing any obstruction, you're being videotaped, it's gonna go on YouTube, you need to comply with the First Amendment.
[02:01:45.657 --> 02:01:49.240]  You may declare that the Bill of Rights is dead, but it's still alive.
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:55.244]  Now, you can go back and be part of America, or you can go ahead and take us to jail, but we're going to sue you.
[02:01:56.067 --> 02:02:06.930]  I mean, my, my, but just, when they try to arrest you, lay down as jellyfish, have one of the people walk off with a camera, because then a lot of cops will go ahead and beat you down, and then charge you with assaulting them.
[02:02:07.710 --> 02:02:10.631]  But that, I mean, that's what the fight for this republic's gonna take!
[02:02:11.211 --> 02:02:11.572]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:12.112 --> 02:02:13.252]  That's what it's gonna take!
[02:02:13.292 --> 02:02:14.592]  You gotta stand up to them!
[02:02:15.193 --> 02:02:16.633]  Yes, sir, and one thing about Ron Paul.
[02:02:17.173 --> 02:02:18.694]  I think we all need to call Bill O'Reilly.
[02:02:18.734 --> 02:02:20.254]  I was listening to his radio show today.
[02:02:20.274 --> 02:02:22.075]  Oh, that pervert's a piece of trash.
[02:02:22.355 --> 02:02:23.415]  He gave Ron Paul
[02:02:24.048 --> 02:02:32.620]  He gave Ron Paul two minutes of air time and I think we all need to call him and ask him why the winner of the debate gets two minutes while he talks about everybody else for 15 to 30 minutes.
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:38.067]  Bill O'Reilly is a compromised blackmailed piece of trash.
[02:02:38.107 --> 02:02:38.808]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.399 --> 02:02:46.159]  Terrorism!
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:47.060]  Terrorism!
[02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:53.244]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:02:53.504 --> 02:02:55.105]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:02:55.345 --> 02:02:57.806]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:02:58.206 --> 02:03:12.775]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:03:12.815 --> 02:03:13.135]  government.
[02:03:13.295 --> 02:03:15.096]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:03:15.476 --> 02:03:21.379]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:03:21.519 --> 02:03:25.981]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[02:03:26.261 --> 02:03:31.883]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:03:31.943 --> 02:03:33.844]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you at 888-803-4438.
[02:03:33.904 --> 02:03:35.685]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:03:47.944 --> 02:03:53.408]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:53.768 --> 02:04:01.433]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.113 --> 02:04:09.157]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.558 --> 02:04:16.402]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:04:16.932 --> 02:04:20.954]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.274 --> 02:04:24.795]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.255 --> 02:04:27.196]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.496 --> 02:04:31.457]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:44.733 --> 02:04:48.817]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[02:04:49.077 --> 02:04:54.162]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[02:04:54.462 --> 02:04:59.106]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[02:04:59.447 --> 02:05:01.408]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[02:05:01.729 --> 02:05:07.574]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:05:07.934 --> 02:05:08.635]  And it works.
[02:05:09.136 --> 02:05:10.597]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[02:05:10.978 --> 02:05:11.979]  Now it's your turn.
[02:05:12.239 --> 02:05:14.601]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[02:05:14.761 --> 02:05:19.025]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:22.428]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[02:05:22.808 --> 02:05:25.010]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[02:05:25.210 --> 02:05:27.572]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[02:05:27.612 --> 02:05:27.872]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[02:05:27.892 --> 02:05:29.734]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:37.701]  Guaranteed.
[02:05:37.942 --> 02:05:38.202]  Call 1-800-894-5152.
[02:05:38.262 --> 02:05:38.483]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[02:05:49.677 --> 02:05:53.859]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:05:54.519 --> 02:05:55.339]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.079 --> 02:05:57.600]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.660 --> 02:06:01.481]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.841 --> 02:06:05.963]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:10.224 --> 02:06:14.766]  You know, when I say Sean Hannity's an enemy of the Republic, a traitor, and a piece of filth, I mean it.
[02:06:16.133 --> 02:06:20.897]  I say Bill O'Reilly is, and Wolf Blitzer is, and Katie Couric and all of them.
[02:06:21.297 --> 02:06:22.078]  They're operatives.
[02:06:22.118 --> 02:06:23.039]  They know what they're doing.
[02:06:23.559 --> 02:06:24.920]  They know they're bringing this country down.
[02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:26.161]  They know they're lying to the public.
[02:06:26.421 --> 02:06:27.842]  They know they're covering up 9-11.
[02:06:28.663 --> 02:06:32.266]  I've heard Sean Hannity say, every child in America needs a microchip.
[02:06:32.326 --> 02:06:33.186]  I have it on video.
[02:06:33.587 --> 02:06:36.189]  I've heard him say, arrest all militia members in the country.
[02:06:36.569 --> 02:06:37.570]  He's for gun control.
[02:06:38.812 --> 02:06:39.592]  And I've just had it.
[02:06:39.973 --> 02:06:40.433]  I'm had it.
[02:06:40.533 --> 02:06:41.793]  I'm done with these people.
[02:06:42.133 --> 02:06:45.355]  I heard Neil Bortz this morning not letting people bring up the Federal Reserve.
[02:06:45.375 --> 02:06:48.716]  They were having a debate about the Fair Tax and a caller called in.
[02:06:49.096 --> 02:06:50.497]  It's a fraud by its very name.
[02:06:51.337 --> 02:06:51.997]  And he called in.
[02:06:52.017 --> 02:06:52.858]  It's just another tax.
[02:06:53.378 --> 02:07:03.822]  And he said, well, you have to understand they can't let you have a fair tax because that would mess up the fractional reserve banking and the Federal Reserve and how they manipulate the currency and how they use that income tax to offset inflation.
[02:07:04.762 --> 02:07:08.244]  Bortz said, I'm not going to talk about you people and those conspiracy theories.
[02:07:09.807 --> 02:07:13.028]  Bill Bortz knows full well it's private, full well it runs everything.
[02:07:14.608 --> 02:07:17.408]  But see, he's gonna pose as a patriot.
[02:07:17.428 --> 02:07:18.789]  I mean, there's nothing worse.
[02:07:19.809 --> 02:07:26.690]  By the way, the problem with the... and I heard him getting real mad about some national column admitting that Scientologists started up the Fair Tax thing.
[02:07:27.670 --> 02:07:29.831]  Twelve years ago, that's who approached me with it.
[02:07:29.871 --> 02:07:33.612]  They were sending me letters and showing up down at the radio station.
[02:07:33.632 --> 02:07:34.812]  I was like, no, thank you.
[02:07:34.932 --> 02:07:35.892]  No, no, no.
[02:07:36.966 --> 02:07:56.676]  Literally, like, you know, swiping my card and getting into the building and closing the door, and then reading the stuff, and then I went and researched it and found out other big consortiums were pushing it, and that, uh, I don't know if they meant well or what, or bad, I don't know, but I found out other groups were pushing it, and that they were going to keep the income tax on top of it, and then use it to track everybody.
[02:07:56.917 --> 02:08:02.339]  You see, the system Bortz is pushing for sounds okay, but that won't be the one that gets implemented.
[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:05.221]  Look, I'm already digressing, it's just
[02:08:07.032 --> 02:08:10.933]  I know we've got Ryan and Glenn and many others that are holding.
[02:08:10.953 --> 02:08:11.793]  We will get to you.
[02:08:11.853 --> 02:08:14.293]  I've got some global warming news I want to cover as well.
[02:08:15.353 --> 02:08:16.394]  But it's a new film.
[02:08:16.534 --> 02:08:17.954]  It's amazingly well done.
[02:08:17.974 --> 02:08:29.176]  He's very professional, very well spoken, very intelligent, and he's one of the best hitters we've got in this fight against the New World Order.
[02:08:29.636 --> 02:08:33.317]  That can be a baseball or that can be a boxing analogy.
[02:08:33.637 --> 02:08:35.277]  I mean, he's one of the best hitters we've got now.
[02:08:35.337 --> 02:08:36.077]  Really effective.
[02:08:36.906 --> 02:08:38.708]  And we appreciate Richard Gage.
[02:08:38.748 --> 02:08:39.808]  He's going all over the country.
[02:08:39.868 --> 02:08:44.732]  He's a very well-known and prominent architect.
[02:08:45.333 --> 02:08:48.375]  And he started Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[02:08:48.415 --> 02:08:51.098]  We have links to that up on InfoWars.com.
[02:08:51.498 --> 02:08:54.260]  And he's been going all over the country now, just in the last few months.
[02:08:54.881 --> 02:09:04.668]  He's got hundreds and hundreds of members of other architects and engineers, very prominent members as well, who see the mathematical evidence, the equations, the laws of physics, and who are experts.
[02:09:04.688 --> 02:09:06.350]  And now we've got all these
[02:09:07.029 --> 02:09:15.511]  Tops architects are starting to come out and top engineers and people in the federal government are saying something's wrong because this is this is mathematics.
[02:09:15.611 --> 02:09:18.092]  I mean, this is this is laws of nature.
[02:09:18.732 --> 02:09:20.653]  These are things that aren't just theories.
[02:09:20.693 --> 02:09:28.255]  These are these are proven facts, you know, at least in the level of energy that we exist in.
[02:09:29.115 --> 02:09:32.056]  And so the new video is 9-11 blueprint for truth.
[02:09:33.247 --> 02:09:40.497]  And I'm telling you, this is what you show a neocon, this is what you show a mainline Hillary Clinton supporting liberal, who, you know, buy whatever the government say.
[02:09:40.517 --> 02:09:43.642]  And you think it's all about Republican, Democrat, and are still caught in that matrix.
[02:09:44.386 --> 02:09:49.772]  This is what you show the school teacher, the engineer, the scientist, the physicist.
[02:09:49.853 --> 02:09:52.776]  This is the video right here.
[02:09:52.796 --> 02:09:54.258]  9-11 Blueprint for Truth.
[02:09:54.598 --> 02:09:56.060]  The Architecture of Destruction.
[02:09:56.540 --> 02:10:01.066]  Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity to see the DVD from Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[02:10:01.086 --> 02:10:01.686]  We have 300 of these.
[02:10:03.488 --> 02:10:07.909]  We're just got in, and they're available for $15 at InfoWars.com.
[02:10:08.129 --> 02:10:12.950]  We're also going to discount it with another one of my videos in the next few days, but you can get it by itself right now.
[02:10:13.410 --> 02:10:32.533]  In this stunning multimedia presentation to the University of Manitoba, Canada, San Francisco Bay Area architect Richard Gage, AIA, depicts in incredible detail to a packed house the evidence which proves the controlled demolition using explosives of all three WTC high-rise collapses.
[02:10:33.263 --> 02:10:37.485]  Folks, you get a free Citizen's Rulebook with it when you get it.
[02:10:37.885 --> 02:10:40.487]  Get it at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:10:40.507 --> 02:10:44.029]  9-11 Blueprint for Truth or call 888-253-3139.
[02:10:44.669 --> 02:10:53.394]  He's going to be speaking several times to several different groups, the We Are Change events, and of course other events coming up in New York City.
[02:10:53.474 --> 02:10:57.736]  I look forward to meeting him in person and interviewing him for an upcoming 9-11 film I'm making.
[02:10:58.316 --> 02:10:59.677]  Mr. Gates, thank you for joining us.
[02:11:01.044 --> 02:11:02.125]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:11:02.225 --> 02:11:04.026]  It's great to be with you again.
[02:11:05.286 --> 02:11:07.127]  Well, your video is just stunning.
[02:11:07.348 --> 02:11:11.270]  I finally got an advance copy before the others came in.
[02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:21.275]  And just in 10 or 15 minutes that I'm going to let you go, and I want you to plug the events coming up in New York, break down what people will see in this video and why it's so important.
[02:11:22.776 --> 02:11:28.819]  Well, what I do is focus on the evidence of controlled demolition in World Trade Center 1 and 2 and 7.
[02:11:30.669 --> 02:11:33.230]  And that's AE 9-11 truth.
[02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:38.371]  That is our bailiwick.
[02:11:38.471 --> 02:11:38.771]  Why?
[02:11:38.852 --> 02:11:47.714]  Because that is the hard, solid evidence that will convince other technical building professionals, which is why our membership is growing.
[02:11:47.754 --> 02:12:00.258]  We now have over 156 AE professionals who are demanding of Congress a new investigation into these collapses, an investigation with subpoena power.
[02:12:01.007 --> 02:12:12.653]  So, what we do is we go through all of the evidence in Building 1 and 2, which I want to share with you this afternoon, and also Building 7.
[02:12:13.694 --> 02:12:17.216]  And we show why the official story does not hold up.
[02:12:17.416 --> 02:12:29.442]  That is to say, 19 hijackers hijacking a plane, bramitting it into the building, and an hour to two hours later, the buildings come tumbling down in a gravitational collapse.
[02:12:30.562 --> 02:12:49.368]  That is a complete fabrication, and anybody who watches the DVD that we're putting out, or the presentation that we're doing in New York this week, in Indiana on 10th, and the Grand Lake Theater in Oakland on the 11th, will readily see, with their own eyes.
[02:12:49.408 --> 02:12:50.808]  This isn't mathematics.
[02:12:50.848 --> 02:12:56.810]  You don't get lost in a glazy-eyed lecture that leaves you.
[02:12:56.830 --> 02:12:59.851]  This is for laypeople as well as architects.
[02:13:00.225 --> 02:13:05.986]  They can readily see that these buildings were demolished and the series of evidence is overwhelming.
[02:13:07.987 --> 02:13:09.367]  Well, it certainly is.
[02:13:09.567 --> 02:13:10.227]  I've studied it.
[02:13:10.247 --> 02:13:12.028]  I've talked to so many other engineers that have seen it.
[02:13:12.388 --> 02:13:13.928]  Let's just focus in on 7.
[02:13:14.108 --> 02:13:17.649]  And I know every few weeks I cover this, folks, because it's got new listeners every minute.
[02:13:17.689 --> 02:13:18.469]  It's so central.
[02:13:18.509 --> 02:13:21.710]  And now this video is available that really cuts to the heart of the matter.
[02:13:22.090 --> 02:13:26.511]  And, you know, basic architecture, basic physics, basic equations and mathematics.
[02:13:26.971 --> 02:13:28.752]  What are the keys to building 7?
[02:13:30.035 --> 02:13:30.436]  Okay.
[02:13:30.936 --> 02:13:39.548]  Well, first of all, most people are completely unaware of this because the media has not shown it, has not talked about it.
[02:13:40.089 --> 02:13:44.194]  And when we show it, to the most part, there's been a couple of
[02:13:46.484 --> 02:13:57.028]  When you see it, you see Building 7 coming down in the exact manner of a controlled demolition, which we all have seen on TV various times.
[02:13:57.928 --> 02:14:00.229]  What do I mean by controlled demolition?
[02:14:01.770 --> 02:14:05.972]  It comes down at virtually free-fall speed.
[02:14:06.392 --> 02:14:13.235]  We're talking about, in six and a half seconds, we're talking about a 47-story skyscraper, which would be the
[02:14:13.823 --> 02:14:16.544]  The highest building in 33 of our states.
[02:14:17.964 --> 02:14:25.627]  And it just plummets down smoothly, vertically, and symmetrically in its own footprint.
[02:14:26.047 --> 02:14:29.508]  An implosion in 6.5 seconds.
[02:14:30.208 --> 02:14:34.630]  And it's a beautiful example, actually, of controlled demolition.
[02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:46.536]  And there are massive explosions at the base, at the inception of this controlled demolition, as witnessed by a couple of different people.
[02:14:46.596 --> 02:14:54.581]  A New York Police Department official, which we have on the DVD, quoting, and also another reporter.
[02:14:55.701 --> 02:14:56.522]  And we have
[02:14:57.589 --> 02:15:22.333]  Explosions on the, in the video you can see on our website, AE911Truth.org, there is seven or eight explosions on the upper right of the building, which are squibs, which we call squibs, they're mistimed explosions, poof, poof, poof, poof, poof, on the 40th through the 47th floor.
[02:15:23.573 --> 02:15:26.354]  It is really quite evident, and
[02:15:27.239 --> 02:15:33.703]  And those were not supposed to go off until those particular floors were down at the bottom.
[02:15:33.763 --> 02:15:34.083]  Why?
[02:15:34.163 --> 02:15:53.595]  Because in order to take down a building like this in controlled demolition, what you have to do is take out the core columns, and then a fraction of a second later, the perimeter columns at the first floor, and then synchronistically timed floor by floor, all the way up the building.
[02:15:54.045 --> 02:16:01.928]  This removes the columns before the next floor comes down so that there's no loss of efficiency.
[02:16:01.988 --> 02:16:05.029]  That's how you get a free fall speed in controlled demolition.
[02:16:05.069 --> 02:16:09.511]  And that's how you keep the piles small and don't even damage buildings 25 feet away like the U.S.
[02:16:09.911 --> 02:16:10.492]  Post Office.
[02:16:10.532 --> 02:16:13.813]  Richard Gage, I look forward to seeing you in New York.
[02:16:13.833 --> 02:16:15.594]  I hope everybody goes to InfoWars.com.
[02:16:16.394 --> 02:16:18.656]  And I hope they get 9-11 Blueprint for Truth.
[02:16:18.996 --> 02:16:26.322]  I look forward to seeing you in New York, specifically for the We Are Change event, because I know I'm interviewing you for my own film Sunday morning.
[02:16:26.342 --> 02:16:27.423]  You've been gracious enough to do that.
[02:16:27.803 --> 02:16:30.065]  What about, when are you specifically speaking in New York?
[02:16:31.647 --> 02:16:42.756]  At the New York 9-11 Truth Ready for Mainstream Conference, I'll be speaking Saturday night at 8 o'clock, and then Sunday afternoon at We Are Change at
[02:16:44.311 --> 02:16:45.612]  Well, it's fantastic.
[02:16:45.632 --> 02:16:50.676]  You're a very, very busy man and we appreciate you running back and forth across the country to spread the truth.
[02:17:04.886 --> 02:17:06.767]  And again, thank you for spending the time with us today.
[02:17:06.807 --> 02:17:12.130]  Incredible film that you've made, 9-11, Blueprint for Truth, available at Infowars.com.
[02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:20.635]  When you get it there, you get a free Citizen's Rulebook, Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights, famous quotes, jury nullification material, right along with it.
[02:17:20.935 --> 02:17:24.457]  Richard Gage, there's so much more in your new film on Tower 1, 2, and 7.
[02:17:24.877 --> 02:17:32.141]  Again, I salute the fabulous job you've done, and I can't wait to see your presentation coming up Sunday, the one I'll be attending.
[02:17:33.262 --> 02:17:38.104]  We'll also be premiering Endgame there right after you speak and that's coming up in New York City.
[02:17:38.324 --> 02:17:39.105]  God bless you, sir.
[02:17:39.965 --> 02:17:40.846]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:17:41.186 --> 02:17:41.586]  You bet.
[02:17:41.947 --> 02:17:43.227]  We'll be right back with your call.
[02:17:43.247 --> 02:17:43.648]  Stay with us.
[02:17:46.986 --> 02:17:58.257]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[02:17:58.457 --> 02:18:04.923]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[02:18:05.163 --> 02:18:06.424]  To below detectable levels.
[02:18:06.724 --> 02:18:10.648]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:18:10.888 --> 02:18:17.414]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:18:17.634 --> 02:18:23.139]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[02:18:23.359 --> 02:18:27.943]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system.
[02:18:28.183 --> 02:18:30.284]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[02:18:30.344 --> 02:18:32.325]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[02:18:32.385 --> 02:18:33.165]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.
[02:18:33.185 --> 02:18:33.386]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:33.426 --> 02:18:35.006]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:18:35.026 --> 02:18:35.967]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:45.684 --> 02:18:55.590]  Ted Anderson reminded September 6, 2007, gold 685.20 ounce gold coins can be purchased for 70706, 348.80 per half, and 174.40 per quarter.
[02:18:57.111 --> 02:18:58.232]  That's 70706, 348.80, and 174.40.
[02:18:59.332 --> 02:19:05.736]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[02:19:05.796 --> 02:19:10.099]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a yuan revolution.
[02:19:10.419 --> 02:19:18.888]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[02:19:18.928 --> 02:19:21.551]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[02:19:21.812 --> 02:19:25.676]  Russia, Switzerland and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[02:19:25.876 --> 02:19:32.263]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[02:19:32.603 --> 02:19:34.244]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[02:19:36.145 --> 02:19:39.328]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[02:19:39.408 --> 02:19:41.909]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:42.009 --> 02:19:44.611]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.131 --> 02:19:47.113]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[02:19:47.353 --> 02:19:50.395]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:19:50.675 --> 02:19:55.418]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:19:55.738 --> 02:19:58.480]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[02:19:58.740 --> 02:20:05.645]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:20:06.085 --> 02:20:15.691]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology, and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free.
[02:20:15.711 --> 02:20:16.011]  Free!
[02:20:16.411 --> 02:20:21.093]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[02:20:21.473 --> 02:20:24.995]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[02:20:25.215 --> 02:20:27.355]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[02:20:27.676 --> 02:20:31.797]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll even refund the shipping charge.
[02:20:32.117 --> 02:20:35.218]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[02:20:35.439 --> 02:20:36.339]  What are you waiting for?
[02:20:36.519 --> 02:20:37.199]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[02:20:37.299 --> 02:20:37.619]  That's 1-888-873-7371.
[02:20:37.659 --> 02:20:37.799]  Today!
[02:20:45.268 --> 02:20:49.532]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:20:49.772 --> 02:20:54.616]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:20:54.877 --> 02:20:56.218]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:20:56.398 --> 02:20:59.741]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[02:21:00.001 --> 02:21:05.166]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[02:21:05.406 --> 02:21:11.191]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[02:21:11.511 --> 02:21:13.933]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[02:21:14.033 --> 02:21:16.354]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[02:21:16.554 --> 02:21:18.696]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[02:21:18.976 --> 02:21:19.956]  No harsh chemicals.
[02:21:20.176 --> 02:21:21.117]  No animal testing.
[02:21:21.377 --> 02:21:22.698]  I use them and love them.
[02:21:22.718 --> 02:21:24.299]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:21:24.579 --> 02:21:25.720]  And I say it big time.
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:27.601]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:21:27.721 --> 02:21:28.061]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[02:21:28.081 --> 02:21:30.583]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[02:21:37.487 --> 02:21:41.149]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:22:06.025 --> 02:22:12.570]  It was great seeing Jimmy Vaughn and his wife Robin Vaughn last night at the Endgame Showing.
[02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:19.354]  I think there's a few tickets left because they hold some back like 20 or so to an hour before, but it's sold out online.
[02:22:20.635 --> 02:22:27.060]  Last showing this week at Endgame and I'm going to show it again on the 17th, that Monday at 7 o'clock at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:29.081]  Hope to see everybody out there tonight.
[02:22:30.976 --> 02:22:34.657]  Alright, coming up, I want to get into global warming fraud and how they're pushing it right now.
[02:22:34.697 --> 02:22:36.238]  And I'm going to continue with your calls.
[02:22:36.258 --> 02:22:39.019]  We're going to get to Ryan, Glenn, Joe, Chris.
[02:22:39.559 --> 02:22:40.659]  That'll probably be it for calls.
[02:22:40.719 --> 02:22:43.340]  I know I can get to those four.
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:49.222]  And this individual right now who disagrees with us, Bertrand in Canada.
[02:22:49.582 --> 02:22:50.562]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:22:51.442 --> 02:22:52.103]  Yes, Alex.
[02:22:52.143 --> 02:22:52.943]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:22:53.203 --> 02:22:54.043]  Loud and clear.
[02:22:54.063 --> 02:22:54.824]  10-4.
[02:22:55.084 --> 02:22:59.265]  Yes, well, it is a pleasure for you to take my call.
[02:23:00.427 --> 02:23:12.464]  And I just like to say that if you're wondering why you have such a large following up here in Canada, it's because we, the militia up here,
[02:23:14.068 --> 02:23:16.029]  We do lots of advertising for you, let's say.
[02:23:16.410 --> 02:23:18.271]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:23:18.631 --> 02:23:24.935]  I think God gets the credit, really, but we're here just reaching out to everyone, and we do have a lot of great Canadians up there.
[02:23:25.196 --> 02:23:27.217]  But with that preface now, give me my lumps.
[02:23:27.237 --> 02:23:28.438]  You've gone to the head of the line.
[02:23:28.738 --> 02:23:29.759]  To disagree, go ahead.
[02:23:30.319 --> 02:23:43.268]  Well, I'm just curious as to why in history, like, we respect your work up here, and you're like our mascot, and we get
[02:23:44.369 --> 02:23:46.190]  Great kick out of all your impressions and stuff.
[02:23:46.511 --> 02:23:51.274]  Not only are you highly intelligent, but you're also very entertaining.
[02:23:52.215 --> 02:24:00.581]  But anyways, we're just curious as to why in history there's certain things that you don't deal with, like the Inquisition.
[02:24:02.602 --> 02:24:13.230]  Certain things in history, you know, you talk about how the crime syndicate is based in London, but you refuse to talk about how their bosses are in Rome.
[02:24:14.446 --> 02:24:18.089]  Well, here's the deal on that, sir.
[02:24:20.831 --> 02:24:23.453]  Put him on hold, and then I'll come back to him before we've got a break.
[02:24:23.493 --> 02:24:25.915]  If not, I'll come back after the break with him.
[02:24:28.036 --> 02:24:30.418]  There's something called factionalization.
[02:24:30.859 --> 02:24:35.822]  There are, what, 20 plus thousand major Christian denominations.
[02:24:37.484 --> 02:24:39.725]  There are hundreds of Jewish factions.
[02:24:39.805 --> 02:24:40.366]  There are
[02:24:41.883 --> 02:24:45.406]  Close to a thousand different sub-sects of Islam now.
[02:24:46.707 --> 02:24:51.671]  And what happens is, it's kind of like in the Patriot Movement, everybody wants to be the head honcho and the leader.
[02:24:53.092 --> 02:24:58.516]  Except me, that's why I don't have some big group you join, or you follow me, or you... Frankly, I don't want it.
[02:24:59.397 --> 02:25:05.702]  I want to lead in the information war, but not be, you know, some little mini pontiff myself.
[02:25:08.130 --> 02:25:12.355]  So years ago, I began researching who ran the New World Order.
[02:25:14.498 --> 02:25:25.932]  And I learned that about 400 years ago, the power of Rome, which was the biggest single global dominant power, even in the first vanguards getting into Japan and China,
[02:25:26.906 --> 02:25:33.630]  And the rudders, because they had the Portuguese who had the navigation charts, they're called rudders.
[02:25:34.190 --> 02:25:37.032]  I was really into naval history, really interesting stuff.
[02:25:37.652 --> 02:25:43.595]  Of course, a big government system, using religion, went around torturing and killing people all over the place.
[02:25:43.675 --> 02:25:44.516]  I mean, that's government!
[02:25:46.104 --> 02:25:53.071]  And so I get these calls almost every day, and it goes, why will you not talk about the Black Pope and this and that?
[02:25:53.091 --> 02:26:02.520]  And I go, okay, they're very corrupt and evil, and the Pope openly calls for a one-world government, and it's working with the New World Order, but I'm not bashing individual Catholics.
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:03.801]  By and large, they're really good people.
[02:26:04.942 --> 02:26:06.804]  And I'm not bashing Jewish people.
[02:26:06.824 --> 02:26:09.467]  I mean, their leadership's very evil, but I'm not bashing Jews.
[02:26:11.413 --> 02:26:13.374]  I get people saying, why do you bash England?
[02:26:13.414 --> 02:26:16.536]  I'm not bashing England, I'm bashing the corrupt leaders there.
[02:26:17.296 --> 02:26:23.420]  And so I have tried to not sit here and do what everybody else has done, and what the New World Order likes.
[02:26:24.621 --> 02:26:26.062]  They like to factionalize it.
[02:26:27.763 --> 02:26:33.267]  The truth is, you cover a Bilderberg group meeting, there are Catholic leaders in there, there are Protestant leaders in there,
[02:26:34.798 --> 02:26:37.500]  There are the banking leaders there, there is the royalty there.
[02:26:38.001 --> 02:26:52.932]  And I mean, I've just read globalist documents that have gotten out, and I mean, I know who started about 400 years ago, supplanted the power of Rome, and that was the Dutch and British royalty, who were German royalty, in both houses.
[02:26:54.513 --> 02:27:03.901]  Orange was founded by the Germans, but 400, well 300 plus years ago, the Germans totally took over, but the point is, side issue,
[02:27:05.167 --> 02:27:09.810]  What I'm getting at here is, start getting into this stuff, it just goes on and on.
[02:27:10.530 --> 02:27:18.715]  Then, I get emails like, I am such and such leader against the Catholics, you will interview me, or you will be proven to be an enemy.
[02:27:19.075 --> 02:27:20.656]  And I'm like, well that sounds like an inquisition.
[02:27:21.616 --> 02:27:27.980]  And then you've got all these people who are Catholics themselves, so they're obsessed with everything being Catholic, and they're just full of baloney.
[02:27:29.230 --> 02:27:34.733]  Let me just explain when we get back, since you're just obsessed on factionalization, as we always do.
[02:27:35.674 --> 02:27:36.574]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.594 --> 02:27:38.696]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.716 --> 02:27:42.378]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:48.421]  Do you know the secret to reading a thousand percent faster?
[02:27:49.022 --> 02:27:54.385]  That's right, the secret that could allow you to read ten books in the time it takes others to read just one.

[02:28:34.452 --> 02:28:34.512]  1-800-990-1878.
[02:28:45.581 --> 02:28:47.522]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[02:28:47.963 --> 02:28:49.704]  Look, up there in the sky.
[02:28:50.124 --> 02:28:51.465]  It's Non-X-Man.
[02:28:51.825 --> 02:28:52.946]  He's in a dive.
[02:28:52.966 --> 02:28:55.268]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[02:28:55.568 --> 02:28:56.348]  Let's go look.
[02:28:58.570 --> 02:29:01.752]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[02:29:02.152 --> 02:29:03.513]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[02:29:03.714 --> 02:29:04.154]  Take them out.
[02:29:04.787 --> 02:29:05.468]  Let's see.
[02:29:05.488 --> 02:29:10.071]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[02:29:10.411 --> 02:29:10.892]  Don't worry.
[02:29:11.332 --> 02:29:12.853]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:29:13.474 --> 02:29:17.897]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[02:29:18.418 --> 02:29:20.479]  Oh, I will, Non-X Man.
[02:29:20.619 --> 02:29:23.321]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[02:29:25.443 --> 02:29:28.086]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[02:29:28.567 --> 02:29:32.050]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[02:29:32.571 --> 02:29:43.702]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[02:29:45.482 --> 02:29:48.023]  Is credit card debt making your life stressful?
[02:29:48.363 --> 02:29:51.685]  Do you avoid answering the phone in fear of another creditor calling?
[02:29:51.965 --> 02:29:55.486]  How would you like to cut your credit card balances by as much as half?

[02:30:37.647 --> 02:30:37.867]  That's 1-800-794-4313.
[02:30:58.839 --> 02:31:03.422]  Okay.
[02:31:03.862 --> 02:31:10.927]  I remember reading, when I was about 15, this thousand-page book, Malachi Martin, The Keys of This Blood.
[02:31:10.947 --> 02:31:22.795]  My dad, when I was like 12, said, you ought to read this, and I wasn't really reading history books then, but a few years later I did read it, and learned a lot, and then later I realized, because somebody that close to it then kind of
[02:31:24.529 --> 02:31:28.232]  It's a tunnel vision where they only see it being Catholic power.
[02:31:29.713 --> 02:31:32.175]  And everybody does this to a certain extent.
[02:31:32.215 --> 02:31:33.996]  I mean, it's whatever group they think it is.
[02:31:34.556 --> 02:31:39.060]  I see the crowd that thinks it's a Jewish conspiracy, who everybody's a Jew.
[02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:40.941]  I'm secretly a Jew.
[02:31:41.922 --> 02:31:43.803]  Everybody in my family's Jews.
[02:31:43.823 --> 02:31:44.223]  They're not.
[02:31:44.243 --> 02:31:46.265]  It wouldn't be bad if they were, though.
[02:31:47.794 --> 02:31:52.175]  I'm getting orders directly, and they even make up names of military officers and things.
[02:31:52.255 --> 02:31:56.736]  If you watch those folks' track record, though, over time they get exposed as being liars.
[02:31:58.496 --> 02:32:07.218]  They're always tied into, you know, there's billions in a bank, we're going to be getting it out, or this famous person, Alan Greenspan, has been arrested.
[02:32:07.238 --> 02:32:10.519]  You know, it's just, they're constantly playing little tricks.
[02:32:12.637 --> 02:32:20.980]  And I think some of them are schizophrenic, some of them are just power-mad nuts, so aggressive that wanting to be dominant in this movement that they just can't help it, they just attack everyone.
[02:32:21.340 --> 02:32:22.461]  We don't do that here.
[02:32:22.601 --> 02:32:27.883]  But I don't screen your calls, and so they come in here, and then we can have these very destructive discussions.
[02:32:28.883 --> 02:32:31.624]  And the reason they're destructive is because it just never ends.
[02:32:32.444 --> 02:32:33.445]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:32:35.265 --> 02:32:36.606]  It is very frustrating to me
[02:32:38.007 --> 02:32:45.634]  That liars, about three years ago, claimed that I work for ABC News, and that Genesis is owned by ABC.
[02:32:46.735 --> 02:32:51.300]  ABC does not own one nickel of Genesis Communications' Midas resources.
[02:32:52.381 --> 02:32:55.043]  Ted Anderson owns it full and completely.
[02:32:56.124 --> 02:33:00.909]  Ted Anderson is a Protestant Swede-slash-German.
[02:33:03.239 --> 02:33:08.202]  There's people saying Ted Anderson is some top Catholic assassin who can throw daggers through oak trees.
[02:33:08.242 --> 02:33:09.383]  I mean, I'm not kidding, folks.
[02:33:10.263 --> 02:33:16.307]  Or he's a devil Jew getting orders from the Knesset.
[02:33:16.367 --> 02:33:17.507]  I mean, it just never ends.
[02:33:17.547 --> 02:33:25.392]  Ted Anderson is a guy who literally cleans the toilets and mops the floors and fixes the computers and tries to break even up there running a very expensive radio network.
[02:33:26.432 --> 02:33:27.073]  Literally, Ted.
[02:33:27.113 --> 02:33:28.313]  I've been up there many times.
[02:33:28.434 --> 02:33:30.795]  The guy goes around with a mop bucket cleaning the toilets.
[02:33:31.698 --> 02:33:34.559]  He's a nice guy, and I have to hear all this stuff about him.
[02:33:34.679 --> 02:33:39.662]  He goes to, dances the tango, goes to tango classes.
[02:33:39.722 --> 02:33:41.562]  I mean, it's just, we're just people.
[02:33:42.663 --> 02:33:51.547]  And you notice when we talk about something, when I say General Tommy Franks is on the CIA payroll, and is out there pushing martial law, it's because it came out he was on the illegal payroll.
[02:33:51.947 --> 02:33:53.007]  I mean, that's something we proved.
[02:33:53.227 --> 02:33:56.149]  Or when I say, our country's gone under U.N.
[02:33:56.189 --> 02:34:01.111]  control during continuity of government, I've got all the evidence and the documents.
[02:34:02.026 --> 02:34:07.048]  Or if I say there's a eugenics plan to exterminate 80% of us, I'll give you 100 pieces of evidence.
[02:34:07.869 --> 02:34:12.971]  These other people who say it's all Jews or say it's all Catholics, a lot of times I've tracked them back.
[02:34:12.991 --> 02:34:14.011]  Let me tell you the camps.
[02:34:15.572 --> 02:34:23.836]  You've got the kind of Israeli propaganda camp who want to demonize people like myself, because we're not huge, you know, all-out supporters of World War III and Israel.
[02:34:24.660 --> 02:34:48.238]  That they've known how to get a more sophisticated attack, use the conspiracy culture against itself, and so I've learned the Israel crowd, while trying to always discredit the Patriot movement with disinfo, and Barbara Olson's been arrested on the border, and Alan Greenspan's been arrested, and there's trillions of dollars about to be released from an ambassador, and you know, there's all these groups, always scuttling around.
[02:34:48.258 --> 02:34:50.500]  I mean, it's so obvious to see what they're doing.
[02:34:52.003 --> 02:34:54.265]  They're all out there, and frankly, they don't have any audience.
[02:34:54.305 --> 02:34:55.465]  Why sit here and talk about them?
[02:34:55.705 --> 02:34:57.947]  I've got all this serious news in front of me.
[02:34:58.027 --> 02:35:00.068]  Big things that are happening.
[02:35:01.108 --> 02:35:01.648]  And the call.
[02:35:01.669 --> 02:35:02.849]  I mean, it can happen five times a week.
[02:35:02.909 --> 02:35:04.650]  You never talk about bull.
[02:35:05.451 --> 02:35:08.112]  I've answered these questions a hundred times, okay?
[02:35:08.832 --> 02:35:10.713]  I've answered these questions a hundred times.
[02:35:11.934 --> 02:35:17.497]  In talk radio, you have to lease a satellite feed.
[02:35:18.547 --> 02:35:18.887]  Okay?
[02:35:18.927 --> 02:35:21.928]  And we used to have, like, Starz Encore, but it was a TV satellite.
[02:35:22.228 --> 02:35:23.729]  Our radio stations couldn't get it.
[02:35:24.569 --> 02:35:26.090]  And then they even stopped offering that.
[02:35:26.170 --> 02:35:35.313]  So we go over and we pay all this money and we get a clear channel feed and they fight with us and don't want to give it to us and we have to threaten them and then they won't unlock the codes for the transmissions to go through.
[02:35:35.513 --> 02:35:36.853]  Station owners are laughing right now.
[02:35:36.873 --> 02:35:37.814]  They know all about this.
[02:35:38.354 --> 02:35:44.516]  They know what an asinine statement it is to go, we're owned by ABC because we lease a feed on a satellite from them.
[02:35:46.416 --> 02:35:48.077]  That's how you get on top radio.
[02:35:49.173 --> 02:35:50.094]  That's where you go.
[02:35:50.114 --> 02:35:54.357]  I mean, it's like I pick up a phone to you and it's AT&T here in Austin.
[02:35:54.537 --> 02:35:58.980]  It doesn't mean I'm under the control of AT&T because I'm talking over an AT&T system.
[02:36:01.081 --> 02:36:08.966]  These disinfo people treat you like children and you act like children and you have no discernment.
[02:36:11.008 --> 02:36:13.329]  So no, I am not and never have been.
[02:36:13.369 --> 02:36:17.212]  It's like McCarthyism or something, but in a bad way.
[02:36:18.214 --> 02:36:27.219]  Again, that's a whole other story, but the point is, it's like the popular notion of McCarthyism to just say, have you ever, are you ever, such and sucher.
[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:29.741]  It is not true.
[02:36:29.981 --> 02:36:31.722]  I have never worked for ABC.
[02:36:32.062 --> 02:36:33.743]  Genesis is not owned by ABC.
[02:36:33.783 --> 02:36:36.065]  We are not an affiliate of ABC.
[02:36:37.386 --> 02:36:46.091]  If you want to be on talk radio, real talk radio, I don't mean playing at it where you've got an internet radio show and you sit around talking about, you know, Vatican killers.
[02:36:47.014 --> 02:36:52.196]  I mean, real radio, you're on Jones, Clear Channel, or ABC.
[02:36:53.496 --> 02:36:57.717]  And the most receivers are ABC because stations in the past carried ABC News.
[02:36:58.618 --> 02:37:01.759]  Fox has now supplanted that, but we're on ABC receivers.
[02:37:02.739 --> 02:37:06.540]  Just call up your local radio station carrying us and say, are they on an ABC receiver?
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:08.961]  Yes, it is an ABC receiver.
[02:37:10.077 --> 02:37:12.180]  And I've explained it 50,000 times.
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:13.141]  People don't do it.
[02:37:13.161 --> 02:37:20.029]  Can you imagine somebody driving along right now listening to 1330 AM and Cameron, Texas and they don't even know what I'm talking about right now.
[02:37:20.289 --> 02:37:21.671]  Total disservice to the public.
[02:37:21.891 --> 02:37:22.933]  Total waste of time.
[02:37:23.593 --> 02:37:25.376]  And in the future I'm not going to address this.
[02:37:25.396 --> 02:37:29.741]  I think I'm going to have like frequently asked questions in like audio files on the website.
[02:37:30.413 --> 02:37:32.474]  I think that's the answer, because it's always the same call.
[02:37:33.115 --> 02:37:34.015]  Different people, same thing.
[02:37:34.295 --> 02:37:35.816]  You know, and their voice is tremulous.
[02:37:36.017 --> 02:37:37.437]  They're going to bring up the big secret.
[02:37:37.457 --> 02:37:39.979]  They're going to give you the incredible grail.
[02:37:40.119 --> 02:37:48.224]  It's, it's, it's, Vatican, Vatican, or Jews, or Reptoids, or David Icke.
[02:37:48.244 --> 02:37:50.325]  You know, it's always the same.
[02:37:51.626 --> 02:37:54.488]  Man, I'm somebody from Texas, here fighting the New World Order.
[02:37:55.373 --> 02:38:04.699]  And we need to fight the... I mean, when you read about COINTELPRO in the 60s, they would go get black groups fighting with each other over who the best leader was.
[02:38:05.499 --> 02:38:10.442]  And they would have some leader having an effect and rallying blacks to stand up for themselves.
[02:38:10.642 --> 02:38:14.284]  And they'd go have people paid off to whisper and say, he's really on the payroll.
[02:38:14.965 --> 02:38:16.726]  He's really, you know, selling us out.
[02:38:18.047 --> 02:38:19.867]  And see everybody fighting with each other.
[02:38:20.087 --> 02:38:25.269]  That's what they do to us, and I watch them go and tell Pro the Patriot Movement over and over again.
[02:38:26.609 --> 02:38:31.610]  I mean, I remember trying to help some poor family in East Texas who called me and asked for help.
[02:38:31.710 --> 02:38:38.531]  And man, then all of a sudden, the local former police chief and a sheriff's deputy told them I was a fed.
[02:38:39.532 --> 02:38:42.292]  So I had to explain to them that I wasn't a fed.
[02:38:42.872 --> 02:38:46.333]  I mean, how dumb did they have to be with the cops telling them that?
[02:38:47.077 --> 02:38:54.260]  I mean, they didn't... I was a big support for them, so they made them make me stop supporting them, and so then they never got me support ever again.
[02:38:57.042 --> 02:39:03.144]  I have to watch people go through this over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[02:39:03.624 --> 02:39:11.828]  There is some, I think he's got to be 60 now, dark-haired guy named Alex Jones, who is the head of Scientology's PR department or something.
[02:39:12.128 --> 02:39:13.509]  Never met him, don't know him,
[02:39:14.817 --> 02:39:17.458]  I frankly did not even want to get anywhere near the Scientologist.
[02:39:19.078 --> 02:39:22.478]  And, uh, doesn't matter.
[02:39:22.558 --> 02:39:23.619]  I'm the head of Scientology.
[02:39:23.639 --> 02:39:26.039]  These people got hundreds of websites saying it, and there's the proof!
[02:39:28.099 --> 02:39:28.759]  There's the proof!
[02:39:31.660 --> 02:39:32.440]  And I get those calls.
[02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:33.880]  Why don't you talk about the S-word?
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:34.440]  What's that?
[02:39:34.540 --> 02:39:35.201]  Scientology.
[02:39:35.241 --> 02:39:37.201]  I'm like, I do talk about it.
[02:39:37.701 --> 02:39:40.061]  I just said they're the ones that first started talking about the Fair Tax.
[02:39:40.281 --> 02:39:41.182]  It's finally in the news.
[02:39:41.462 --> 02:39:42.482]  I don't know why they're doing it.
[02:39:42.502 --> 02:39:43.782]  I don't want to get anywhere near them.
[02:39:45.737 --> 02:39:48.619]  Well, you interviewed somebody once who spoke at one of their events.
[02:39:49.059 --> 02:39:52.321]  I mean, you know, in crazy con... It isn't about that, folks.
[02:39:52.581 --> 02:39:58.765]  And maybe this is good to talk about this and spend a few minutes on it, because maybe it'll get you to then recognize it when you see it.
[02:40:03.268 --> 02:40:07.110]  Now, on the Catholic issue, I'm from Texas.
[02:40:08.571 --> 02:40:10.712]  This has been a predominantly Protestant state.
[02:40:11.132 --> 02:40:13.834]  My family are Protestants as far back as it goes.
[02:40:13.874 --> 02:40:15.335]  They came here on the Mayflower.
[02:40:16.104 --> 02:40:17.104]  I don't think so.
[02:40:34.272 --> 02:40:43.821]  He got real mad because he heard about Christians having to, uh, Protestants having to pledge to Catholicism in Texas to be given land grants by the Spanish and the Mexicans.
[02:40:44.081 --> 02:40:47.564]  So he got on a boat that sold all his land that, by the way, the U.N.
[02:40:47.605 --> 02:40:48.105]  is built on.
[02:40:48.145 --> 02:40:49.026]  My family owned that.
[02:40:49.651 --> 02:40:51.172]  They own that whole swath.
[02:40:51.612 --> 02:41:05.757]  He sold it all, and it was worth a lot of money even back then, bought a shipload of Bibles, King James Version, came in and landed at Galveston, had the Vatican assassins try to kill him, come after him.
[02:41:06.037 --> 02:41:09.398]  He had to go up to Nacogdoches and set things up there.
[02:41:09.458 --> 02:41:14.780]  He was one of the prime people with Andrew Jackson's, you know, folks that helped stir up the revolution here.
[02:41:16.098 --> 02:41:26.942]  And I try to not fight with Catholics, I try to not get into it, because they're just normal people like us, under the control, and the Protestants are totally run by the New World Order now too, saying attack Iran, New World Order, all this baloney.
[02:41:27.482 --> 02:41:36.065]  It's all shot, it's all controlled, and it's so asinine to have David Ayers, you know, raise Colonel Travis's son,
[02:41:37.907 --> 02:41:40.791]  I mean, on my mama's side, it's like every side of the family who came in here.
[02:41:40.851 --> 02:41:41.913]  I mean, it's not just that side.
[02:41:41.933 --> 02:41:42.974]  It's all of them in the war.
[02:41:43.275 --> 02:41:44.336]  My daddy's family.
[02:41:44.556 --> 02:41:46.459]  I mean, just all over the revolution.
[02:41:47.581 --> 02:41:49.864]  All over the first revolution on both sides.
[02:41:51.025 --> 02:41:51.947]  And I'm proud of that.
[02:41:52.888 --> 02:41:53.629]  And, and, and...
[02:41:55.074 --> 02:41:59.896]  I've learned more about Catholics now, because of all the attacks and the people making stuff up about me.
[02:42:00.237 --> 02:42:08.180]  I've gone, and just you look at it, and they're so arrogant, they're so full of themselves, they're so sure, and they're bearing false witness!
[02:42:10.642 --> 02:42:12.022]  But then some of them I know are feds.
[02:42:12.623 --> 02:42:16.805]  But then you get the well-meaning weak minds that then parrot, that's why it's called Mockingbird.
[02:42:18.606 --> 02:42:21.227]  And they're mad, they want me to
[02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:24.150]  joined their group.
[02:42:24.190 --> 02:42:25.650]  A lot of them are Seventh-day Adventists.
[02:42:25.751 --> 02:42:27.591]  And I mean, they get violently angry.
[02:42:27.631 --> 02:42:30.951]  If you won't become a Seventh-day Adventist, you must be a blood-drinking Catholic.
[02:42:32.952 --> 02:42:35.212]  And it's just that's how it works, folks.
[02:42:36.812 --> 02:42:38.813]  And I don't want to be in your sex.
[02:42:38.953 --> 02:42:40.933]  I don't want to be in your little groups.
[02:42:41.053 --> 02:42:43.254]  I don't... I'm just... I just love God.
[02:42:43.354 --> 02:42:46.634]  I love being the good guy.
[02:42:46.734 --> 02:42:49.375]  I love trying to do good things and feel good about myself.
[02:42:49.695 --> 02:42:51.555]  And I'm just covering the news and information.
[02:42:52.623 --> 02:42:53.764]  That's all I've ever done.
[02:42:54.124 --> 02:42:55.585]  That's all I've ever tried to do.
[02:42:55.845 --> 02:42:56.926]  That's who I am.
[02:42:57.907 --> 02:43:01.890]  And I had some guy at the movie last night ask me about that, and I just blew up at him.
[02:43:03.931 --> 02:43:09.936]  Because they always say it with such... They're ringing up the big secret there.
[02:43:10.836 --> 02:43:12.137]  Oh, and that's all they do!
[02:43:12.618 --> 02:43:18.042]  Half the Patriot Movement talks trash about other people in the movement, and never does anything!
[02:43:18.282 --> 02:43:19.683]  That's COINTELPRO!
[02:43:21.613 --> 02:43:24.215]  I got stacks of news about the North American Union today.
[02:43:24.455 --> 02:43:27.417]  I got stacks of news about global taxation in front of me today.
[02:43:27.457 --> 02:43:29.618]  I got Hillary calling for global tax and government.
[02:43:29.899 --> 02:43:34.842]  I got all these clips, all these calls, all this information you'll never talk about.
[02:43:35.262 --> 02:43:36.463]  You'll never discuss.
[02:43:36.583 --> 02:43:38.244]  You'll never get baloney.
[02:43:42.467 --> 02:43:44.849]  You need to address right now that you work for ABC.
[02:43:47.151 --> 02:43:50.834]  You need to address right now that you're with the Reptoids.
[02:43:51.074 --> 02:43:51.894]  There's a lot of those.
[02:43:52.415 --> 02:43:55.997]  You need to address right now that... Let me think of another one.
[02:43:58.499 --> 02:43:59.839]  Oh, there's all sorts of them.
[02:43:59.859 --> 02:44:00.720]  It's all sorts of it.
[02:44:01.761 --> 02:44:05.163]  And it doesn't bother me that I'm being attacked.
[02:44:05.323 --> 02:44:07.044]  In a sick way, I kind of giggle at it.
[02:44:08.585 --> 02:44:12.608]  I guess that's just about... I've got defense mechanisms built into me that I actually like being attacked.
[02:44:12.788 --> 02:44:13.248]  It's sick.
[02:44:13.308 --> 02:44:14.109]  I'm trying to stop it.
[02:44:15.118 --> 02:44:17.039]  And, uh, because it's actually funny.
[02:44:17.159 --> 02:44:20.440]  I mean, it's kind of a source of humor around here, but I realize it's not funny.
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:27.282]  Because, I mean, it is funny for somebody to claim you're some top killer assassin working for some Jesuit general.
[02:44:27.302 --> 02:44:29.282]  I mean, that's funny when it's not true.
[02:44:30.763 --> 02:44:34.624]  But it's not funny because it turns people away from ever doing action.
[02:44:35.024 --> 02:44:36.504]  Going down and fighting land grabs.
[02:44:36.584 --> 02:44:39.285]  I guarantee you, in your county, they're taking some old lady's land this weekend.
[02:44:40.726 --> 02:44:41.767]  You're not going to do anything about it.
[02:44:42.108 --> 02:44:43.809]  You're not going to go help people at a soup kitchen.
[02:44:43.970 --> 02:44:45.071]  You're not going to hug your wife.
[02:44:45.271 --> 02:44:47.573]  You're not going to fight the trans-Texas corridor.
[02:44:47.794 --> 02:44:54.921]  You're just going to sit around on message boards and talk about, he's a this or he's a that.
[02:44:56.963 --> 02:45:02.249]  I'm here to cover news and information and get people thinking and get people taking action.
[02:45:04.997 --> 02:45:13.321]  And I remember years ago getting an email going, you will interview me about this, or you are a co-agitator of some term.
[02:45:13.341 --> 02:45:17.142]  And I'm like, well, I don't interview people when they act like that.
[02:45:19.743 --> 02:45:20.864]  Oh, absolute proof!
[02:45:20.884 --> 02:45:21.284]  You see?
[02:45:21.304 --> 02:45:26.546]  He's under the control of the... And it's a joke.
[02:45:27.847 --> 02:45:29.988]  I mean, don't you know the ADL who's been caught
[02:45:30.626 --> 02:45:38.412]  Creating and running and Southern Poverty Law Center, Nazi groups, terror groups, provocateuring, fake Klan groups.
[02:45:39.593 --> 02:45:40.473]  The Germans do it.
[02:45:40.493 --> 02:45:41.254]  They all do it.
[02:45:41.294 --> 02:45:46.037]  They do that so they can point at them and say, see, we need to take your rights away and your free speech away.
[02:45:46.618 --> 02:45:47.759]  Well, it's the same thing.
[02:45:47.959 --> 02:45:48.839]  I refuse.
[02:45:49.300 --> 02:45:50.301]  Number one, I don't believe it.
[02:45:50.661 --> 02:45:52.522]  Number two, I'm not here to hate on people.
[02:45:52.922 --> 02:45:55.184]  Number three, I mean, the average Catholic's a good person.
[02:45:55.224 --> 02:45:56.625]  The average Jew's a good person.
[02:45:56.925 --> 02:45:58.827]  The average person in England is a good person.
[02:45:59.716 --> 02:46:04.801]  They've got evil leadership, and I've never shrunk away from exposing any of those groups.
[02:46:05.441 --> 02:46:10.006]  We're writing articles criticizing Israel, trying to push us into starting World War III right now.
[02:46:11.607 --> 02:46:14.270]  That's very unpopular with the establishment to do that.
[02:46:14.530 --> 02:46:15.791]  I get attacked for doing that.
[02:46:18.634 --> 02:46:19.275]  But I do it.
[02:46:20.115 --> 02:46:21.837]  But I do it in an even-handed way.
[02:46:24.731 --> 02:46:30.296]  So, on record, I am not going to answer these questions anymore because it isn't pertinent to what I'm doing.
[02:46:30.656 --> 02:46:32.818]  Okay, now there is a long ten minute answer, sir.
[02:46:32.858 --> 02:46:36.120]  You got ten minutes of the show to sit there or more.
[02:46:37.021 --> 02:46:38.522]  My gosh, you got more than ten minutes.
[02:46:38.542 --> 02:46:40.804]  That guy called in at like twenty-six after when I went to him.
[02:46:41.664 --> 02:46:49.651]  I've spent twenty-something minutes talking about this now with you, trying to go over the facts.
[02:46:50.707 --> 02:46:54.248]  Uh, and, uh, there you have it, and I'm sure you're not going to listen.
[02:46:54.508 --> 02:46:56.368]  So, go ahead, Bartrand, you got the floor.
[02:46:57.989 --> 02:47:00.109]  Well, Alex, can you hear me?
[02:47:01.790 --> 02:47:02.670]  Yeah, you're on the air, man.
[02:47:02.830 --> 02:47:03.390]  You're on the air.
[02:47:04.650 --> 02:47:11.812]  Well, it's almost like you're trying to demonize us, because we're asking why you're not talking about these questions.
[02:47:12.332 --> 02:47:13.473]  I am talking about it.
[02:47:13.493 --> 02:47:19.314]  We're not a part of these groups that, uh, you know, talk about aliens and all the rest of it.
[02:47:20.211 --> 02:47:21.611]  I was covering the field, sir.
[02:47:22.412 --> 02:47:22.672]  Okay.
[02:47:23.232 --> 02:47:24.792]  Just let me make one plug.
[02:47:25.273 --> 02:47:34.115]  I want you to, personally, please, as a brother, you call yourself a Christian while I'm a Christian, and I'm one who prays for you and thinks about you all the time.
[02:47:34.135 --> 02:47:35.836]  No, you just said I call myself a Christian.
[02:47:35.916 --> 02:47:38.216]  Are you calling me a liar right now?
[02:47:38.397 --> 02:47:41.017]  No, I'm not calling you a liar.
[02:47:41.137 --> 02:47:42.818]  I believe that you're a God-fearing man.
[02:47:43.118 --> 02:47:47.619]  I don't think you'd be bearing the fruit that you do if you weren't.
[02:47:48.540 --> 02:47:49.720]  But, you know,
[02:47:51.687 --> 02:47:55.109]  The Bible talks about how the devil masquerades as an angel of light.
[02:47:56.529 --> 02:48:07.114]  Well, a hundred years ago, a hundred and fifty years ago, our Christian, Protestant, Protestant forefathers are what made this land free.
[02:48:08.775 --> 02:48:12.937]  You don't talk about the Vatican Connection and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.
[02:48:13.797 --> 02:48:14.958]  Or even John F. Kennedy.
[02:48:15.238 --> 02:48:17.359]  Yeah, listen, listen, sir, I appreciate your call.
[02:48:17.779 --> 02:48:19.800]  John F. Kennedy was a Catholic.
[02:48:20.433 --> 02:48:24.234]  That's what I mean, the people you're listening to are full of bull!
[02:48:25.635 --> 02:48:27.835]  I'm not debating that the Vatican is an evil!
[02:48:28.616 --> 02:48:29.956]  See, debate over with!
[02:48:31.177 --> 02:48:33.177]  But, it's just, you're not going to listen.
[02:48:33.197 --> 02:48:37.859]  You're in your factions, you're going to just, you'll never hurt the New World Order with what you're doing.
[02:48:38.179 --> 02:48:40.600]  You've got to cover some issues that are happening right now.
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:41.720]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:48.448 --> 02:48:53.893]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.273 --> 02:49:01.900]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.597 --> 02:49:09.641]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.061 --> 02:49:21.507]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.787 --> 02:49:25.730]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.750 --> 02:49:27.691]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.011 --> 02:49:31.853]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:48.747 --> 02:49:51.630]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:49:51.870 --> 02:49:58.056]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:50:45.017 --> 02:50:49.061]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:50:49.281 --> 02:50:52.684]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:50:52.864 --> 02:50:56.368]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:50:56.608 --> 02:50:59.931]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:51:00.011 --> 02:51:05.356]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[02:51:05.376 --> 02:51:10.621]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal form it's like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[02:51:10.981 --> 02:51:12.022]  Thank you for your time.
[02:51:28.453 --> 02:51:38.459]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:51:38.839 --> 02:51:40.560]  That toll-free number again?
[02:51:40.580 --> 02:51:41.721]  1-877-928-8822.
[02:51:42.481 --> 02:51:51.087]  The scientific community released a report that proves beyond a doubt that the Earth is getting warmer.
[02:51:52.107 --> 02:51:56.550]  This global warming is caused by things you grown-ups do and by the things you don't.
[02:51:57.952 --> 02:52:02.714]  If drastic measures aren't taken soon, by the time I grow up there won't be any fish left in the sea.
[02:52:03.715 --> 02:52:06.356]  Rainforests and clean air will be a thing of the past.
[02:52:07.777 --> 02:52:09.177]  The polar ice caps will be gone.
[02:52:10.158 --> 02:52:10.978]  Oceans will rise.
[02:52:11.899 --> 02:52:13.399]  Entire countries will disappear.
[02:52:14.620 --> 02:52:17.061]  Life will change in ways you can't even imagine.
[02:52:18.162 --> 02:52:18.942]  There could be famine.
[02:52:19.942 --> 02:52:21.063]  Worldwide epidemics.
[02:52:22.664 --> 02:52:24.144]  Life expectancy will be lower.
[02:52:25.545 --> 02:52:27.166]  And we're not just talking about the future.
[02:52:28.066 --> 02:52:29.888]  We're talking about my future.
[02:52:31.389 --> 02:52:32.510]  But this is no surprise.
[02:52:33.130 --> 02:52:34.832]  You adults have known about this for years.
[02:52:35.392 --> 02:52:37.654]  And though you could have done something about it, you haven't.
[02:52:38.755 --> 02:52:40.416]  You can say, it's not my problem.
[02:52:41.077 --> 02:52:43.539]  You can say, I won't be around in 50 years.
[02:52:44.260 --> 02:52:46.822]  But from now on, you can't say I didn't know.
[02:52:47.958 --> 02:52:50.019]  Starting today, the lines are drawn.
[02:52:50.519 --> 02:52:51.619]  You have to choose sides.
[02:52:51.639 --> 02:53:00.661]  We don't have time to play all this and get into... McDonald's is taking half the money from Big Macs in Japan and places and giving it to global warming groups.
[02:53:00.681 --> 02:53:02.422]  That means groups that are pushing for global tax.
[02:53:03.062 --> 02:53:07.103]  They put out a big UN report saying the Earth's gonna get hotter and make everybody have heart attacks.
[02:53:08.223 --> 02:53:12.265]  DiCaprio's movie's not doing well though, but the cover is a footprint stomping on the Earth.
[02:53:12.285 --> 02:53:13.705]  You know, the image is man is bad.
[02:53:14.511 --> 02:53:20.356]  They now admit what I said months ago, that they're going to push for a global one-child policy through taxes on more than one child.
[02:53:20.376 --> 02:53:25.540]  I've just got a big stack here of wall-to-wall push for global tax.
[02:53:26.881 --> 02:53:30.744]  And whoever runs the New World Order, we can debate that and fight over it all day.
[02:53:31.024 --> 02:53:36.629]  We know the New World Order is there, and we know what they're setting up, and we better educate people about this fraud right now.
[02:53:36.829 --> 02:53:39.411]  Because if the New World Order gets its global tax, it's already got it
[02:53:40.717 --> 02:53:46.081]  From IMF and World Bank funds and a bunch of other areas, but that's all dwarfed by this.
[02:53:46.641 --> 02:53:48.202]  If they get it, we're in deep trouble.
[02:53:48.362 --> 02:53:52.485]  And this is a eugenicist pushing this entire world extermination system.
[02:53:53.186 --> 02:54:00.911]  And again, instead of arguing all day about who runs it, we know all the major power blocks are giving their power into this system.
[02:54:01.631 --> 02:54:02.792]  We need to fight it.
[02:54:03.052 --> 02:54:04.213]  We need to expose it.
[02:54:04.453 --> 02:54:06.094]  We need to get the word out.
[02:54:07.310 --> 02:54:08.431]  Where is that in my stack?
[02:54:08.451 --> 02:54:10.033]  There was a bunch of other news here.
[02:54:10.994 --> 02:54:12.836]  Dealing with the global warming hysteria.
[02:54:13.657 --> 02:54:18.682]  And meanwhile, they're cross-species human chimeras with animals.
[02:54:18.842 --> 02:54:23.727]  I mean, just open-air planting of chimera plants with human genetics in them.
[02:54:23.787 --> 02:54:26.270]  I mean, it's just... Talk about end times.
[02:54:26.310 --> 02:54:29.413]  This stuff is all out of control.
[02:54:30.908 --> 02:54:38.083]  And we need to get out of our ninnying closets, out of our prayer closets, out of our little perseveration groups, because everybody wants to be THE special little group.
[02:54:38.384 --> 02:54:39.707]  You need to just get out and fight evil.
[02:54:40.285 --> 02:54:44.367]  You need to get out and take action and face down corruption.
[02:54:44.388 --> 02:54:45.508]  I don't care where it is.
[02:54:45.868 --> 02:54:48.730]  You need to do it now in every way.
[02:54:48.750 --> 02:54:58.496]  You need to come out to New York and expose that the military industrial complex carried out those attacks to bring in fear and to bring in World War III and to bring in their world government.
[02:54:58.896 --> 02:55:01.078]  And I want to see you in New York at all those events.
[02:55:01.578 --> 02:55:01.958]  Come.
[02:55:02.058 --> 02:55:02.438]  Be there.
[02:55:02.499 --> 02:55:03.219]  This is history.
[02:55:04.125 --> 02:55:06.967]  I want you to come tonight to the Endgame Showing and the one on the 17th.
[02:55:06.987 --> 02:55:15.033]  I want you to go to InfoWars.com and get my documentary films and make copies of them or PrisonPlanet.tv, download them in high quality, burn them to discs.
[02:55:15.333 --> 02:55:16.214]  Give them to people!
[02:55:18.135 --> 02:55:19.496]  The water's pouring in here.
[02:55:19.536 --> 02:55:20.937]  We've got to fix this breach.
[02:55:21.017 --> 02:55:22.879]  We've got to repair what's happened.
[02:55:24.260 --> 02:55:28.523]  We've got to take action against the New World Order and stop fighting with each other in our own movements.
[02:55:29.932 --> 02:55:32.012]  Let's go for smaller government.
[02:55:32.072 --> 02:55:33.493]  It won't matter who's pulling the strings.
[02:55:33.533 --> 02:55:35.873]  They won't have the mechanisms to control us.
[02:55:37.074 --> 02:55:39.654]  I'm trying to actually beat the new old order, not nanny around.
[02:55:41.395 --> 02:55:43.955]  And I ask God to lead, God, and direct us in all of our fights.
[02:55:43.975 --> 02:55:45.595]  I want to thank all of our Aminatham affiliates.
[02:55:45.615 --> 02:55:51.677]  I want to thank the Shorter Affiliates, Internet, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.net, JonesReport.com.
[02:55:52.257 --> 02:55:57.318]  Thank you, the listeners, the sponsors, John Harmon up there running the show, everybody.
[02:55:58.889 --> 02:56:03.771]  And I just want to thank all of you out there for your support and those of you that have stayed focused on issues that matter.
[02:56:04.211 --> 02:56:05.932]  Educating the public about the Federal Reserve.
[02:56:06.332 --> 02:56:08.492]  Educating the public about the North American Union.
[02:56:08.993 --> 02:56:10.793]  I didn't even get to all the North American Union news.
[02:56:11.533 --> 02:56:14.174]  All these other calls, I shouldn't have blown 20-30 minutes on that.
[02:56:14.214 --> 02:56:15.295]  I'm not doing it anymore.
[02:56:15.675 --> 02:56:16.775]  You're a COINTELPRO.
[02:56:16.815 --> 02:56:19.776]  Even if you're a mockingbird and don't mean it, I'm not going to be part of it.
[02:56:19.796 --> 02:56:20.557]  Do you understand?
[02:56:20.917 --> 02:56:21.757]  God bless you all.
