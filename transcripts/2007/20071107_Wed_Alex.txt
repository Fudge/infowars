[00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:06.372]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:08.113]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.773 --> 00:00:09.893]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.353]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.113 --> 00:00:13.034]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.694 --> 00:00:17.315]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:21.976]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.237 --> 00:00:29.317]  Two-time Super Bowl champion.
[00:00:30.057 --> 00:00:31.137]  Dallas Cowboy.
[00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.258]  Five-time Pro Bowler.
[00:00:35.957 --> 00:00:40.522]  Mark Stavnoski will be joining us coming up in the third hour today.
[00:00:42.124 --> 00:00:43.826]  Very honored to be having him come on.
[00:00:43.846 --> 00:00:49.792]  Already familiar with some of his other work in the fight against the phony war on drugs.
[00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:56.539]  A very informed individual, so this Super Bowl champion slash
[00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:11.543]  Pro Bowler will be joining us coming up to talk about 9-11 truth and his serious questions surrounding and concerning the official story that is coming up in two hours from now.
[00:01:12.163 --> 00:01:18.785]  Dr. Michael Kaufman covering how the mainline environmental groups were literally founded by the eugenicists.
[00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:19.625]  I'm going to be clear.
[00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:21.766]  I'm not against having a good environment.
[00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:22.506]  I'm for that.
[00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.747]  None of us want to breathe poison air or drink poison water.
[00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:27.718]  In fact, the contrary.
[00:01:27.758 --> 00:01:36.569]  The big banks and big money that has come in with their PR firms have taken over any of the real environmental groups that form that actually have an effect.
[00:01:38.428 --> 00:01:43.972]  Or they'll just sick of the FBI or police on other groups that are legitimately out doing things.
[00:01:44.613 --> 00:01:46.895]  Right now it's all about global taxation.
[00:01:46.975 --> 00:01:48.336]  It ties into the endgame.
[00:01:48.856 --> 00:02:00.745]  So Dr. Michael Kaufman will be joining us coming up in the second hour and talking about the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment where they openly talk about 80 plus percent population reductions and a lot more.
[00:02:00.865 --> 00:02:05.369]  That is coming up in the second hour today as well.
[00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:08.787]  There is a lot going on.
[00:02:10.468 --> 00:02:16.792]  I got a surprise call last night at about nine o'clock that they wanted me on Coast to Coast AM, so I did that.
[00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:20.053]  And I guess I'm not my old self.
[00:02:20.114 --> 00:02:27.458]  I used to do six, seven, eight, nine hours of radio a day, but I already did four other interviews yesterday, my own show, and then Coast to Coast.
[00:02:27.658 --> 00:02:32.641]  I am getting into my step, though, here, kind of trying to fire up, get the brain working.
[00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:44.093]  But I tell you, we are certainly burning the midnight oil when it comes to the fight against the Global Crime Syndicate.
[00:02:45.453 --> 00:02:49.055]  I'm feeling a lot of anxiety, and I'm not normally someone who has a lot of anxiety.
[00:02:49.115 --> 00:02:50.055]  I'm normally at ease.
[00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:58.638]  But right before 9-11, I had the same feelings I'm having now, and I've had similar feelings only a few other times.
[00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.980]  All of that anxiety is completely dwarfed
[00:03:03.675 --> 00:03:05.076]  That is what I'm feeling in my gut.
[00:03:07.176 --> 00:03:12.798]  All that past anxiety is completely eclipsed, obscured, blotted out.
[00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.680]  A pall hangs over me.
[00:03:17.578 --> 00:03:18.519]  Not of depression.
[00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:21.241]  I'm very happy and love my life and I'm energized.
[00:03:21.842 --> 00:03:26.005]  But just a pall, a black pall, kind of a black cloud.
[00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:27.666]  And everybody feels it.
[00:03:28.127 --> 00:03:30.128]  But intellectually, I don't just go off my gut.
[00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.932]  Intellectually, I know one of the major reasons that I'm so upset.
[00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:37.254]  But there's also something more there.
[00:03:38.335 --> 00:03:42.498]  It's them wanting to start on World War III in Iran.
[00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.761]  It's what's happening with the police state here domestically.
[00:03:47.044 --> 00:03:50.985]  It's that the establishment feels like a cornered rat and is more dangerous now than ever.
[00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:56.186]  The dollar plunged even more today.
[00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:58.087]  It plunged again yesterday.
[00:03:58.107 --> 00:04:10.489]  The things that are happening right now are just unspeakably serious and still the general public does not know what it means to have a devalued dollar.
[00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.810]  Your savings are
[00:04:14.873 --> 00:04:23.215]  Plunging upwards of a cent each week, and by a cent I mean per dollar that you have, it's plunging around a cent.
[00:04:23.255 --> 00:04:31.258]  That means you're losing around 1% of your savings, your purchasing power, every single week with your assets.
[00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:42.021]  I'm going to try to break this down when we get back, as we just chronicle this unfolding and happening.
[00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:47.123]  And I heard some things this morning on talk radio that were very disquieting.
[00:04:48.184 --> 00:04:55.770]  I heard two national hosts reading talking points, and it was a key sign in this whole system.
[00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:57.211]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:03.297]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:04.358 --> 00:05:05.419]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:10.303]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our government.
[00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.052]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.793 --> 00:05:27.176]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.137 --> 00:05:35.099]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:39.060]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.961]  Bill Burgess makes great progress in the New World Order.
[00:05:42.021 --> 00:05:43.161]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:43.901]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.941 --> 00:05:45.021]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:45.982]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.222 --> 00:05:47.362]  That's what they're after, you see.

[00:07:52.402 --> 00:07:54.824]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:24.598]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:32.720]  Welcome Mark Stepnowski, pro bowler, two-time Super Bowl champion, Dallas Cowboy, Houston Oiler.
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.081]  We'll be joining us to talk about 9-11 truth in the third hour.
[00:08:36.101 --> 00:08:37.601]  Dr. Michael Kaufman in the second hour.
[00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:42.822]  For those that just joined us, my sound a bit frazzled today.
[00:08:43.663 --> 00:08:45.463]  It's because I've been rode hard, put away wet.
[00:08:46.169 --> 00:08:47.029]  We're good to go.
[00:09:15.976 --> 00:09:19.819]  Okay, the serious, serious news that we have here in front of us.
[00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:26.003]  Crude oil gold surge amid dollar reserve worry.
[00:09:27.144 --> 00:09:34.149]  And gold is only $2 from breaking the 1980 all-time record.
[00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:42.755]  But for gold to have the same purchasing power it had versus purchasing it with the dollar in that ratio, in that conversion,
[00:09:44.091 --> 00:09:48.993]  It will need to go to $2200 plus an ounce.
[00:09:49.093 --> 00:09:59.837]  So if it is indeed going to make that move and get parity with true dollar devaluation, we will see $2200 an ounce gold.
[00:09:59.897 --> 00:10:01.338]  I do not know if that's going to happen.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:11.463]  But it is $15 up today, and it is literally on the heels of the 1980 record right now.
[00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:13.844]  This certainly is a day long remembered.
[00:10:14.404 --> 00:10:17.945]  Crude oil gold surge amid dollar reserve worry.
[00:10:17.965 --> 00:10:21.266]  You know, they're finally admitting why gold and oil are going up.
[00:10:21.926 --> 00:10:24.547]  Now, usually they'll claim it's some storm in the Gulf or
[00:10:25.595 --> 00:10:41.828]  So, Leprechaun, you know, bit somebody or something ridiculous happened, but in real financial internal publications and policy reports and IMF World Bank documents, they are totally honest about what they're actually doing to us.
[00:10:41.888 --> 00:10:46.232]  And there's one publication I've seen that really does tell the truth, and that's the Financial Times of London.
[00:10:46.532 --> 00:10:55.159]  They put a slight spin on it, but they admit the big central banks are having a large, ravenous blood meal right now on your back.
[00:10:55.976 --> 00:11:04.140]  When I think about my detractors who put up websites, news stories from a year ago, two years ago, saying, Alex Jones is a kook.
[00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:06.242]  He said the dollar would plunge.
[00:11:06.662 --> 00:11:08.283]  He said the economy was in trouble.
[00:11:08.343 --> 00:11:09.003]  Where is it?
[00:11:09.763 --> 00:11:25.452]  Well, if you haven't noticed that we're at all-time private debt, government debt, corporate debt, if you haven't noticed that people are having to work two, three jobs, if you haven't noticed all the real economic indices showing we're in deep trouble, and this is just the beginning, you're just blind.
[00:11:26.283 --> 00:11:28.425]  You're just absolutely completely blind.
[00:11:30.387 --> 00:11:33.911]  Fox News, though, came out yesterday, and we even have the clip of it.
[00:11:33.931 --> 00:11:34.952]  We may have time to play it later.
[00:11:35.473 --> 00:11:36.854]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:11:37.154 --> 00:11:38.956]  And they said, hey, a $1 is good.
[00:11:40.038 --> 00:11:43.801]  It's very good, and we thank the President for the great job he's done.
[00:11:44.402 --> 00:11:46.164]  This is another stroke of genius.
[00:11:46.184 --> 00:11:48.847]  Yes, a stroke of genius.
[00:11:49.634 --> 00:12:00.539]  Thank you, Emperor, for all you do, as if you actually run anything, you're a complete puppet of the big central banks, who own the defense contractor companies, and, of course, the big oil companies.
[00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:04.661]  So, crude oil, gold surge amid dollar reserve worry.
[00:12:05.841 --> 00:12:13.765]  I was up at about 2.30 in the morning doing George Norrie's broadcast last night with Daniel Estill, and it was a great co-interview.
[00:12:13.785 --> 00:12:16.286]  It was great to be interviewed there with Daniel.
[00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:22.212]  By the way, it's in Endgame, and there it was, London Independent.
[00:12:22.532 --> 00:12:32.295]  There was the Chinese head of their central bank saying that they're going to go ahead and start accelerating the dump of the dollar out of their $1.43 trillion in holdings.
[00:12:32.515 --> 00:12:35.716]  I thought it was $1.2 trillion, but I guess that was six months ago.
[00:12:35.736 --> 00:12:43.519]  I guess they hold a couple hundred million more with their balance of trade.
[00:12:44.199 --> 00:12:46.000]  See, the bankers create a fiat system.
[00:12:46.741 --> 00:12:57.266]  And then they get us over-leveraged by design, and now they're busy putting out hundreds of articles a day, literally, saying, we deserve it, we're spoiled, we're bad, Americans did this.
[00:12:58.086 --> 00:13:01.588]  It's the fact of the poor people that went and took loans they couldn't pay.
[00:13:01.968 --> 00:13:04.469]  That has nothing to do with it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:04.489 --> 00:13:14.954]  It was the big banks that issued all this credit, pumped this bubble up, and then three months ago, cut off the conduit of that credit to the people, not to the central banks themselves.
[00:13:15.598 --> 00:13:18.439]  It is a orgy of looting that's going on.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:27.023]  The pound hits $2.10 USD mark as dollar battered by Qing comments.
[00:13:28.464 --> 00:13:29.285]  We'll be going over that.
[00:13:29.805 --> 00:13:32.166]  UK rate cut grows more likely.
[00:13:33.684 --> 00:13:45.775]  As they try to cut their interest rates, to at least slow the slide of the dollar, they want a slow decline so we don't get too restless in the IMF and World Bank's own words.
[00:13:47.296 --> 00:13:51.100]  As their former chief economist Joseph Stiglitz told you here in January,
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.843]  Continuing, 4X pound again hits $2.10 USD market.
[00:13:57.903 --> 00:13:59.464]  Dollar battered by Ching's comments.
[00:13:59.484 --> 00:14:00.385]  We're going to be going over that.
[00:14:00.945 --> 00:14:04.828]  Also from George Washington blog, 9-11 family member Patty
[00:14:06.898 --> 00:14:07.418]  I think so.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.565]  In Ron Paul news, will Ron Paul be excluded from Iowa debates?
[00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:31.307]  It's being openly discussed.
[00:14:31.327 --> 00:14:32.789]  It's up on JonesReport.com.
[00:14:33.209 --> 00:14:38.175]  It's being openly discussed to exclude him from the debate, claiming he's not a first year candidate.
[00:14:38.376 --> 00:14:44.203]  It was okay to have him up there and ignore him and short shift him and only give him a third of the time the other candidates got.
[00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:46.118]  We're good to go.
[00:15:07.646 --> 00:15:12.529]  Also, CBS labels Ron Paul, this is a quote, meaningless fruitcake.
[00:15:12.589 --> 00:15:13.869]  Boy, that's very scientific.
[00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.651]  It's just so ridiculous.
[00:15:17.131 --> 00:15:27.457]  With no chance of winning, Kevin Drumm, Channel South Park's officer, Bar Bradley, nothing to see here folks, move along.
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.544]  Yeah, they're actually saying, nothing to see here folks, move along.
[00:15:32.744 --> 00:15:39.351]  And for Americans who want to still be willfully ignorant about what's happening, I guess that actually works on them.
[00:15:39.992 --> 00:15:41.333]  You tell them, move along, and they do.
[00:15:42.855 --> 00:15:48.821]  Got a story up on TruthandNews.us, Oberman, does Bush want to remake U.S.
[00:15:49.571 --> 00:15:51.572]  into invisible fascist state.
[00:15:51.932 --> 00:16:09.382]  Now, all day they talk about Islamo-fascist, but when you talk about invading countries, incredible corporate corruption, attacks on liberties and freedoms, and then the trappings, the terms, the names, the symbols, the signets, the logos, the verbiage, the vernacular,
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.521]  Nomenclature.
[00:16:13.541 --> 00:16:19.825]  I mean, they follow classical Nazi-style fascism to a T, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:20.665 --> 00:16:23.026]  So we'll be going over that and playing some of the overman statements on it.
[00:16:23.387 --> 00:16:24.067]  Very eloquent.
[00:16:25.528 --> 00:16:27.269]  Also, state of emergency.
[00:16:27.329 --> 00:16:32.833]  Could Bush ever arbitrarily declare martial law like Musharraf has in Pakistan?
[00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:38.356]  And let me just stop right there and make some comments about that.
[00:16:41.698 --> 00:16:48.602]  Here at the studio last night, in between interviews, I guess it was about 11.30 at night.
[00:16:49.322 --> 00:16:50.462]  I wasn't recording it.
[00:16:51.743 --> 00:16:54.725]  I came walking out of the bathroom.
[00:16:54.745 --> 00:17:03.149]  Aaron was in the front writing this article about him wanting to exclude Ron Paul from Iowa, and I had the TV sound down real low on CNN.
[00:17:03.169 --> 00:17:07.151]  We keep a couple TVs on with different news channels in the back room.
[00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:14.161]  I look up, and it shows these people lined up.
[00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:15.822]  Somebody's got to have this on tape.
[00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:18.744]  Anderson Cooper's 360 last night.
[00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:29.411]  And it shows what's happening in Pakistan, and it showed them hurting people on the back of trucks for no reason, just beating them, kicking them in the hind end, hitting them with belly clubs.
[00:17:31.153 --> 00:17:34.615]  And I saw Anderson Cooper smile real wickedly.
[00:17:34.635 --> 00:17:35.976]  You know, he's admittedly CIA.
[00:17:36.036 --> 00:17:37.477]  He was CIA and the one in the media.
[00:17:38.408 --> 00:17:39.588]  And a total propagandist.
[00:17:39.949 --> 00:17:42.389]  Not a very good one at that, by the way, but he's a little darling, I guess.
[00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:44.410]  A little trollop.
[00:17:45.410 --> 00:18:05.437]  And there he was, and I saw him smiling with the audio down, so I turned it up, and I sit down, and I look back up, and they're just talking about, well, they're getting tough over there, and he's doing what he needs to do, but they're actually defending it, and Aaron walks in, and he's talking to me, and I turn and look, and Aaron's not looking, and they've got people lined up by a car.
[00:18:07.934 --> 00:18:11.117]  And their machine guns opened fire.
[00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:18.443]  I'm talking at like 10 feet away and you see the people crumple and fall to the ground like something on a red dom and they've got them lined up and shooting them.
[00:18:18.823 --> 00:18:21.085]  But the audio was real low and I kind of double-checked.
[00:18:21.125 --> 00:18:22.546]  I was like, did I just see that?
[00:18:23.567 --> 00:18:33.375]  Did any of you, in fact, we're not really open phones right now, but if you saw that too, because it was just literally like you can't believe you just saw it.
[00:18:34.216 --> 00:18:35.237]  And I'm hoping that I
[00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:42.112]  No, we didn't catch it on tape, and that was the rebroadcast of the day, so that was it.
[00:19:02.717 --> 00:19:05.798]  I think he's on it like 9 at night or 8 at night and they re-air it a few hours later.
[00:19:05.898 --> 00:19:08.119]  So if you saw that, please let me know.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:17.962]  This morning I was tuning around on talk radio listening to a national host based out of San Antonio that I tuned into Neil Bortz.
[00:19:18.583 --> 00:19:28.646]  And I heard both of them say, two separate national shows, that well if Al Qaeda comes in and bombs one restaurant and kills 50 people, it's going to plunge our economy.
[00:19:28.906 --> 00:19:29.806]  And get ready for it.
[00:19:30.447 --> 00:19:31.387]  And I've always said that
[00:19:32.313 --> 00:19:44.360]  They may stage a small attack here, and then totally plunge the economy, or make the announcement it's plunged, in some type of psychological view that Al-Qaeda did it, because I've seen that pattern before, and I heard two different shows saying that.
[00:19:45.321 --> 00:19:47.102]  That isn't a good sign.
[00:19:48.183 --> 00:19:51.064]  And there's no doubt, listening to Bortz, that he's getting talking points.
[00:19:52.085 --> 00:19:55.167]  That guy is no libertarian, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.
[00:20:02.356 --> 00:20:06.181]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:20:06.221 --> 00:20:07.482]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:20:07.642 --> 00:20:11.226]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:20:11.507 --> 00:20:14.030]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.192]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:20:16.512 --> 00:20:18.815]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:20:19.856 --> 00:20:23.598]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:20:23.638 --> 00:20:25.479]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:20:35.524 --> 00:20:37.425]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:20:37.625 --> 00:20:40.085]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.

[00:21:02.393 --> 00:21:04.816]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:05.477 --> 00:21:13.547]  Did you know that Senate committee investigations in the 1960s called the international communist movement the greatest conspiracy the world has ever witnessed?
[00:21:14.448 --> 00:21:21.777]  They said the communists had infiltrated into high government offices in the State Department and also advisors to presidents.
[00:21:22.623 --> 00:21:30.290]  Did you know that the communist infiltration successfully stopped all FBI investigations into their secret activities?

[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.281]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:23:01.198 --> 00:23:03.020]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:08.344]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:23:08.524 --> 00:23:09.865]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:23:10.125 --> 00:23:18.311]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:18.531 --> 00:23:24.316]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:26.197]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:26.277 --> 00:23:28.399]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:28.539 --> 00:23:32.804]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:32.984 --> 00:23:35.147]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:23:35.207 --> 00:23:42.975]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:23:43.456 --> 00:23:43.776]  We're good.
[00:24:05.077 --> 00:24:13.599]  Alright, uh, Chris is gonna, he key voted, he's gonna rewind it and check it, but he remembered seeing guys kind of in military garb, like cargo pans and things, mercenaries,
[00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.691]  Opening fire and shooting some people.
[00:24:34.711 --> 00:24:37.293]  And they didn't say what it was on CNN.
[00:24:37.874 --> 00:24:38.614]  That was the thing.
[00:24:39.735 --> 00:24:49.923]  Then they had these two guests on who were going, well, Perez Musharraf's a bad guy and he's killing all these people, but he's really our guy and we need him there to fight Al Qaeda.
[00:24:49.943 --> 00:24:52.205]  And thank goodness he's there.
[00:24:53.126 --> 00:24:55.828]  CNN was just defending open martial law.
[00:24:57.169 --> 00:25:00.792]  And dragging people out in business suits and beating them and kicking them.
[00:25:01.838 --> 00:25:03.419]  What looked like shooting him.
[00:25:03.819 --> 00:25:07.900]  And again, I hope I was wrong with what I saw last night, but you're rewinding it now.
[00:25:10.121 --> 00:25:11.021]  Is it Chris, did you say?
[00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:12.421]  Yeah, my name is Chris.
[00:25:12.441 --> 00:25:13.122]  I'm from Boston.
[00:25:13.482 --> 00:25:14.802]  I called a couple weeks ago.
[00:25:14.822 --> 00:25:16.123]  I'm the CGI artist.
[00:25:16.523 --> 00:25:19.024]  I do computer graphics, animation.
[00:25:19.044 --> 00:25:21.784]  Yeah, I was, I have a T-bone watch right now.
[00:25:21.804 --> 00:25:23.445]  It's a quick clip.
[00:25:23.505 --> 00:25:27.666]  It's only like two seconds, almost like they panned over and then they caught it and then they panned back.
[00:25:27.906 --> 00:25:29.587]  So you don't really catch it very well.
[00:25:30.798 --> 00:25:35.600]  Um, but I... From the flash I saw, it looks like paramilitary folks shooting people.
[00:25:36.021 --> 00:25:40.943]  Yes, um, well, it cuts, it catches a muzzle flash, and then it's, you see somebody slump.
[00:25:41.503 --> 00:25:44.705]  And it's about, uh, maybe four seconds before they pan away.
[00:25:44.725 --> 00:25:49.347]  Well, my eye's pretty good, and just in the flash of seeing it, they're shooting people about ten feet away.
[00:25:49.367 --> 00:25:51.648]  They flash, you see them crumple, and that's it.
[00:25:51.708 --> 00:25:54.689]  Now, again, I wasn't recording it, so I can't say that's what I saw.
[00:25:54.749 --> 00:25:55.229]  You got it.
[00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.711]  Yeah, um, I'm under infamous killer, that's my CG name.
[00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:00.484]  I want to put it up on YouTube.
[00:26:00.504 --> 00:26:02.965]  I have my camera here, a TV camera.
[00:26:03.605 --> 00:26:09.946]  I don't know how to hook it up to my computer for good quality, but I can take a picture of it, of my TV, put that on the net for you.
[00:26:10.786 --> 00:26:11.687]  And it may be nothing.
[00:26:11.727 --> 00:26:15.247]  It may be some people on a firefight, but it sure looked like that just in the two, three seconds.
[00:26:15.827 --> 00:26:17.308]  I have a question.
[00:26:17.328 --> 00:26:18.588]  They're doing the same thing with Budo.
[00:26:18.648 --> 00:26:24.409]  Didn't her husband get convicted of all types of war crimes, and now they're saying he's some democracy, wonderful person?
[00:26:24.949 --> 00:26:26.950]  Wasn't she thrown out of the country for war crimes?
[00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.650]  Yes.
[00:26:28.735 --> 00:26:29.055]  You know?
[00:26:29.416 --> 00:26:30.456]  This is just horrible.
[00:26:30.917 --> 00:26:40.124]  And now they have these new laws that if a child, anybody under the age of 17, is convicted of a felony, they get expelled from every school in the United States.
[00:26:40.604 --> 00:26:41.045]  This new law.
[00:26:41.065 --> 00:26:41.885]  I don't know if you knew about it.
[00:26:41.906 --> 00:26:43.187]  Yeah, it's all federalization.
[00:26:43.227 --> 00:26:45.208]  It's total federal control over everything.
[00:26:45.248 --> 00:26:49.912]  And the feds are under United Nations regulation under UNESCO.
[00:26:50.472 --> 00:26:56.037]  And it's a literal war against humanity by the elite, as the elite circle the wagons against the population.
[00:26:57.338 --> 00:26:58.940]  You know, Ron Paul hopefully wins.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.164]  I mean, I don't see much of a chance for this country if he doesn't win.
[00:27:02.804 --> 00:27:09.092]  I'm sorry to say it, but... Well, Chris, Chris, try to isolate exactly what's going on in that video and then call us back, okay?
[00:27:09.132 --> 00:27:11.394]  And then email us the video still of it.
[00:27:11.875 --> 00:27:14.098]  Okay, I'll email you my YouTube upload.
[00:27:14.358 --> 00:27:15.119]  Okay, God bless you.
[00:27:16.872 --> 00:27:34.018]  Okay, as for talking points, Neil Bort, Sean Hannity, it was like ten of them, remember about a year ago they went to the White House, sat around, openly got talking points and were told what to say by Bush and thanked for their fake conservatism and keeping the sheep in the pens by posing as conservatives.
[00:27:34.058 --> 00:27:35.658]  Keep your friends close, your enemies closer.
[00:27:36.199 --> 00:27:43.241]  The neocons' enemies are the conservatives if they woke up in this country, so they keep you under the little watchdog's eyes.
[00:27:43.945 --> 00:27:45.206]  But there was no doubt this morning.
[00:27:45.586 --> 00:27:47.508]  I was listening to Glenn Beck and I was listening to Bortz.
[00:27:47.568 --> 00:27:51.932]  I tuned into some other show and it was all, you wait until the Islamists hit America.
[00:27:51.952 --> 00:27:52.692]  They're about to.
[00:27:53.313 --> 00:27:55.454]  The economy is going to implode.
[00:27:55.575 --> 00:27:56.976]  It is the Islamists!
[00:27:58.077 --> 00:27:59.698]  I mean, if you slip on a banana peel...
[00:28:00.376 --> 00:28:00.496]  Yes, I
[00:28:22.251 --> 00:28:34.459]  They were actually implying that the economy is in trouble because of Muslims, and then saying, and the Muslims, they're going to go in and blow up 50 people in a discotheque here in the U.S.
[00:28:34.499 --> 00:28:35.780]  in a restaurant or something.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.883]  This is multiple shows saying this at the same time, by the way, roughly.
[00:28:40.683 --> 00:28:41.344]  I'm flipping around.
[00:28:41.364 --> 00:28:44.506]  I mean, the scripting is even in unison.
[00:28:46.427 --> 00:28:49.049]  The scripting is even in unison now.
[00:28:50.826 --> 00:28:59.329]  And this caller on Neil Bortz is going, yeah, but I'm a Ron Paul libertarian, you know, this war is making the Muslims hate us, making them fight us more, and Neil Bortz says, that's ridiculous.
[00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:10.092]  Well, the Pentagon's own P2OG public plan said they were going to go into Iraq, tear the place down, divide it in three parts, and fund different groups to kill each other, and export revolution.
[00:29:10.752 --> 00:29:16.234]  Our government went into secular governments in the last 50, 60 years, overthrew them, and put Muslim extremists in.
[00:29:16.634 --> 00:29:19.075]  Iraq was secular, now it's an Islamic state!
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.721]  And they tell us Iran is Al-Qaeda when they're Shiite, the opposite group!
[00:29:24.762 --> 00:29:27.743]  Neil Borich is a smart guy, 30 years on air, and a lawyer.
[00:29:27.803 --> 00:29:28.604]  He knows all that.
[00:29:30.665 --> 00:29:32.085]  And he said, I'm simplifying it.
[00:29:32.425 --> 00:29:33.466]  They want to kill us.
[00:29:34.466 --> 00:29:35.807]  We've got to kill them.
[00:29:36.807 --> 00:29:39.549]  Oh, but your King Bush is letting them in at record numbers.
[00:29:40.429 --> 00:29:42.210]  See, it doesn't work like that, punk.
[00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:43.170]  And you are.
[00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:47.532]  You're an anti-American traitor, an enemy of the Republic boards.
[00:29:47.812 --> 00:29:48.813]  You know you're a liar.
[00:29:51.582 --> 00:29:54.606]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.528 --> 00:29:58.211]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.573 --> 00:30:08.335]  There are many types of storable foods, but how about a superfood that contains every nutrient that the human body needs for survival?
[00:30:08.355 --> 00:30:20.378]  50% protein, 300 milligrams of potassium per ounce, and calcium and magnesium for your heart and bones, with many more nutrients found in this incredible food source that the government does not want you to have.
[00:30:20.638 --> 00:30:25.559]  This product is available in powder, seeds, and oil, and is shipped free to your door in the U.S.
[00:30:25.959 --> 00:30:29.484]  This product is illegal to grow in the U.S., but is legal to import.
[00:30:29.745 --> 00:30:31.988]  Don't waste time thinking about storing food.
[00:30:32.168 --> 00:30:36.955]  Plan ahead and prepare for yourself and your family now, and be in control of your destiny.
[00:30:37.236 --> 00:30:41.382]  You can save and invest your money, but in the end, food will be your greatest asset.
[00:30:41.662 --> 00:30:44.906]  Remember what the Word of God says in Ezekiel 719.
[00:30:45.146 --> 00:30:50.332]  Call 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[00:30:50.632 --> 00:30:52.875]  Remember, food will be your greatest asset.
[00:30:53.075 --> 00:30:53.315]  Call 908-691-2608.
[00:30:53.375 --> 00:30:55.037]  This product does not contain THC.
[00:30:55.077 --> 00:30:55.477]  Call 908-691-2608 today!
[00:31:01.864 --> 00:31:06.447]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:31:06.847 --> 00:31:09.788]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:31:10.108 --> 00:31:12.670]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:17.852]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:31:18.233 --> 00:31:23.595]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:26.877]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:31:27.057 --> 00:31:27.617]  We're good to go.
[00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:57.174]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:31:58.495 --> 00:31:58.975]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:31:59.155 --> 00:32:04.998]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:32:05.158 --> 00:32:10.401]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:32:10.681 --> 00:32:16.024]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:16.384 --> 00:32:17.445]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:17.865 --> 00:32:26.931]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:32:27.191 --> 00:32:28.812]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:32:29.032 --> 00:32:37.878]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[00:32:38.258 --> 00:32:39.919]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:42.840]  Keep it natural.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:51.342]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.

[00:32:55.623 --> 00:32:56.683]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:22.096]  I've had enough of fake, conservative, Judas Goats, Benedict Arnolds, in our midst.
[00:33:38.946 --> 00:33:43.751]  Posing as conservatives, posing as libertarians.
[00:33:44.752 --> 00:33:52.761]  I have had enough of them shilling for the global corporations that are literally ending this nation's sovereignty right now.
[00:33:52.781 --> 00:33:58.107]  We are in the jaws of the military-industrial complex that is now foreign-owned.
[00:33:58.815 --> 00:34:00.096]  We are under attack.
[00:34:00.897 --> 00:34:07.022]  And I'm not mincing any more words or playing any more games.
[00:34:07.863 --> 00:34:10.085]  I am forgetting the maneuvers.
[00:34:10.245 --> 00:34:12.106]  I'm going straight at them.
[00:34:13.568 --> 00:34:14.368]  Straight at them.
[00:34:15.329 --> 00:34:17.511]  Ramming speed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:18.452 --> 00:34:19.052]  Right at them.
[00:34:19.853 --> 00:34:21.975]  We're going to board the enemy in the info war.
[00:34:21.995 --> 00:34:24.397]  And we're going to take the fight to their decks.
[00:34:25.037 --> 00:34:32.022]  We're going to rake their capital ships' decks in the Infowar, and we're going to go in with the initiative, and we're going to defeat the globalists.
[00:34:32.802 --> 00:34:45.631]  And then we're going to open up all the books of all the paid-for media whores, and all the people on the Pentagon payroll, and I'm telling you right now, you're going to cold, hard shells, and cold, hard, busting rocks, you traitors.
[00:34:47.853 --> 00:34:50.975]  And everybody's going to know, I'm telling you, your enemies of the Republic,
[00:34:51.613 --> 00:34:55.678]  I've had enough of you claiming you're defenders of the Republic when you're the opposite!
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.922]  You tell us cyanide was mother's milk.
[00:35:01.205 --> 00:35:06.672]  You try to give us a false choice and act like you're against Hillary when your whole Republican machine is behind her.
[00:35:06.712 --> 00:35:07.914]  It's disgusting.
[00:35:09.713 --> 00:35:12.075]  And I, for one, am not going to play games with it anymore.
[00:35:12.615 --> 00:35:18.580]  Joe, Mark, Robert, Rich, David, and many, many others that are patiently holding, we're going to get to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:30.188]  Program note, I will be at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar this evening, with a speech at the end, and an extended question and answer at the end of the film.
[00:35:30.208 --> 00:35:34.151]  I'll be doing double duty doing the live TV show during the film.
[00:35:35.292 --> 00:35:37.514]  And then I am also
[00:35:38.456 --> 00:35:45.700]  I'm going to be there tomorrow night at the beginning and the end of the film, the last showing, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar, this Thursday.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:50.042]  And I hope to see you there to see Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:35:50.722 --> 00:36:04.669]  If you want to get the premiere film exposing the history of the New World Order, who they are, where the Bilderberg Group meets, what their battle plans are, their own documents that we've had our agents basically get info out, steal it, and of course sources inside.
[00:36:05.908 --> 00:36:08.831]  It's all there, and then their master plan, the eugenicist.
[00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:15.937]  Why they want world government, and once they have it in place, how they plan to forcibly exterminate 80% of the world's population.
[00:36:15.977 --> 00:36:22.022]  Dr. Michael Kaufman will be discussing that with us, coming up in the next hour, and we'll have open phones as well.
[00:36:22.423 --> 00:36:25.005]  I hope you go to PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:36:25.831 --> 00:36:27.312]  I've thrown into the fight 110%.
[00:36:28.012 --> 00:36:29.993]  I passed the point of no return a long time ago.
[00:36:30.373 --> 00:36:44.399]  I committed 110% more than 12 years ago to this fight and I'm completely given over, completely consumed with the fight against these people and all I ask you to do is it's on that same burning spirit of liberty and freedom.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:58.145]  And all I ask you to do is to go to PrisonPlanet.tv and to burn high quality copies of End Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement on the disc or DVD aggressively, dozens a day if you can do it.
[00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:10.389]  And get it out to everybody and savagely growl while you're doing it because that's where the winning the fight begins when you get down in your gut and you get serious and you commit.
[00:37:11.039 --> 00:37:18.280]  That's how we're going to bring these criminals to justice, is committing 110% in defense of this republic.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:23.981]  That's how we're going to defeat these people instead of just submitting to them over and over again.
[00:37:24.181 --> 00:37:26.042]  I'm tired of submitting to their rape.
[00:37:26.502 --> 00:37:31.122]  I'm tired of them murdering millions of Iraqis in our name in the last 17 years.
[00:37:31.183 --> 00:37:39.524]  I'm tired of them putting cancer viruses in our vaccine and arresting teenagers for marijuana and enslaving us and CPS-ing people's children.
[00:37:40.333 --> 00:37:43.654]  I'm not going along with it anymore and I've committed myself to this.
[00:37:45.914 --> 00:37:49.355]  I've put myself out there on the field, however the chips fall.
[00:37:49.915 --> 00:37:51.116]  It doesn't matter, I'm committed.
[00:37:51.996 --> 00:37:58.918]  I'm asking you to go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a 15 cent a day membership and start burning those suckers to disk.
[00:37:59.338 --> 00:38:03.699]  Your membership just pays for the bandwidth on our huge servers we've gotten, super high quality.
[00:38:04.517 --> 00:38:09.201]  Or go to Infowars.com and get Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement on the high quality DVD.
[00:38:09.221 --> 00:38:11.182]  We've got them as low as $10 when you get them in bulk.
[00:38:12.543 --> 00:38:14.544]  You get 10-15 copies of this and you're done.
[00:38:14.565 --> 00:38:15.765]  You've done your Christmas shopping.
[00:38:15.785 --> 00:38:16.946]  You say, hey, here's the truth.
[00:38:16.966 --> 00:38:18.067]  You check it out for yourself.
[00:38:18.407 --> 00:38:19.748]  Or tell me what you think about this.
[00:38:20.209 --> 00:38:23.171]  Or call toll free to get Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:38:23.191 --> 00:38:23.551]  888-253-3139.
[00:38:23.571 --> 00:38:23.611]  888-253-3139.
[00:38:35.843 --> 00:38:44.429]  Or you can write to me, right here deep in the heart of Texas, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:52.315]  A lot of people in the system, a lot of people that work for this corrupt government, know now that we've been telling the truth all along.
[00:38:52.335 --> 00:38:53.136]  They've spoken out.
[00:38:55.769 --> 00:38:58.910]  Individuals in the Pentagon and State Department have exposed the torture.
[00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:00.250]  There's good people.
[00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:02.670]  We're not alone in this fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:09.131]  We need to pray that God give us guidance and put a hedge of protection up around those that are fighting this system.
[00:39:09.371 --> 00:39:11.172]  Let me briefly talk more about the economy.
[00:39:11.452 --> 00:39:15.772]  You know, when I say I'm speechless on this subject, I'm just dumbfounded.
[00:39:15.933 --> 00:39:17.733]  I am flabbergasted.
[00:39:17.953 --> 00:39:20.913]  I am stunned.
[00:39:21.373 --> 00:39:22.974]  I am taken back.
[00:39:23.354 --> 00:39:24.314]  I am staggered.
[00:39:25.667 --> 00:39:28.029]  I am buffeted, shaken.
[00:39:32.012 --> 00:39:33.873]  In fact, I mean, I don't even know what to say.
[00:39:35.154 --> 00:39:48.143]  When it is finally discovered by the average, self-righteous, important, know-it-all, twinkle-eyed yuppie that they have been absolutely robbed.
[00:39:48.163 --> 00:39:52.587]  I mean, it's such a magician's trick that the stock market is at $13,400 or whatever,
[00:39:55.356 --> 00:40:03.360]  And that for it to be at the purchase value of 2,000, it would have to be well above 20,000 points right now.
[00:40:04.521 --> 00:40:16.688]  It would have to be close to 23,000 points right now to just keep the same value that it had in the year 2000.
[00:40:17.268 --> 00:40:24.012]  And you have these people who've made 5-10% a year in the stock market, they cannot believe you
[00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:27.932]  When you explain to them, people play in the market, they're gambling.
[00:40:29.734 --> 00:40:32.476]  Gamblers Anonymous and they don't know it, they should definitely go.
[00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:39.761]  And so they willfully are in willful denial and they just refuse to listen to us.
[00:40:39.901 --> 00:40:49.729]  If we could have, a few years ago, made this a major issue, gotten people concerned, pointed out that it was a political decision made by the private banks that own this country and much of the planet,
[00:40:51.147 --> 00:40:59.953]  From their own documents, we could have politically forced them to not devalue the dollar, and to try to stabilize the economy.
[00:41:00.273 --> 00:41:04.516]  Instead, they went with just telling you it's great, while every real indicator went down the toilet.
[00:41:06.217 --> 00:41:12.201]  And now, this is going to make thirty-nine, this is going to make twenty-nine, this is going to make the late seventies.
[00:41:12.962 --> 00:41:19.086]  Unfortunately, any way you slice it, any way you dice it, any way you cut it,
[00:41:19.824 --> 00:41:20.665]  We're good to go.
[00:41:43.883 --> 00:41:47.926]  You've got to put duty and honor and truth and information and love first, and then you can have things.
[00:41:48.527 --> 00:41:49.608]  But the point is, that's their God.
[00:41:49.628 --> 00:41:53.050]  They're so... Can you imagine them when they find out they're bankrupt?
[00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:55.112]  Can you imagine them when they find out they're going to lose everything?
[00:41:55.132 --> 00:41:56.873]  Can you imagine how they're going to behave?
[00:41:58.575 --> 00:42:06.481]  Well, I said a key point would be, when they plunged the economy, in the week before 9-11, they started plunging the stock market.
[00:42:07.153 --> 00:42:14.419]  And then they carried out the 9-11 attacks and said, oh, see, that made it all fall, and everybody blamed the Muslim extremists for hurting their pocketbooks.
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:24.427]  Well, even if you believe Muslim extremists did it, and don't know the facts, you would still understand that it was already plunging before then.
[00:42:24.968 --> 00:42:29.792]  And I've said a tell-tale size when they start saying Muslim extremists are plunging the economy.
[00:42:30.012 --> 00:42:33.415]  There's no connection, they don't ever give evidence, they don't ever give facts for that.
[00:42:36.161 --> 00:42:41.784]  You know, that's like saying of a water faucet bust in your kitchen that Al-Qaeda did it.
[00:42:42.205 --> 00:42:43.325]  It has as much validity.
[00:42:44.006 --> 00:42:45.466]  But I'm now hearing them say that.
[00:42:45.546 --> 00:42:46.847]  Heaven help us.
[00:42:46.907 --> 00:42:48.368]  I mean, the public is so mindless.
[00:42:48.408 --> 00:42:49.149]  Those that aren't awake.
[00:42:49.689 --> 00:42:52.490]  You've got one crowd waking up more than ever and becoming enlightened.
[00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:58.394]  The other crowd getting even more willfully dumb and slovenly and arrogant in their ignorance.
[00:43:01.055 --> 00:43:01.996]  When they find out
[00:43:02.714 --> 00:43:03.554]  That this has happened.
[00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:06.015]  A lot of them are going to become more police state supportive.
[00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:07.875]  They're going to become more wild-eyed.
[00:43:08.255 --> 00:43:13.797]  They're going to tell the government, you do whatever you want, you just give us our economy back.
[00:43:16.838 --> 00:43:30.161]  And it's all a tool of control, and to see gold pushing its 1980 all-time record, about to break its all-time record, and I think it'll do it today, we've still got two and a half hours
[00:43:33.214 --> 00:43:40.140]  Until, or more than that, until 4 o'clock Eastern when gold closes, and it's gyrating between 833 and 837.
[00:43:41.201 --> 00:43:48.908]  In overseas trading last night, it went above 840, but we're talking about spot gold here in the United States.
[00:43:49.428 --> 00:43:52.711]  Gold futures and gold stocks are already way above that.
[00:43:54.653 --> 00:43:56.554]  Futures on gold are well above 840 right now.
[00:43:59.574 --> 00:44:01.835]  I'm not saying they're betting in the future that it will go above that.
[00:44:01.855 --> 00:44:02.976]  I think that's a safe bet.
[00:44:03.036 --> 00:44:06.157]  Whether it'll be today or tomorrow or next week, next month, I don't know.
[00:44:07.918 --> 00:44:12.640]  But we're now at the point where you could wake up any morning and the banks will have closed their doors.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.921]  It's already happened in Northern Rock.
[00:44:14.981 --> 00:44:17.602]  It's already happening with the biggest bank in France.
[00:44:18.143 --> 00:44:21.024]  It's already happened with Countrywide, the second largest mortgage lender.
[00:44:21.804 --> 00:44:27.707]  Citigroup is gyrating, just toppling, a shaking house of cards and a big gust of wind is on its way.
[00:44:29.085 --> 00:44:30.527]  And you try to talk about P.E.
[00:44:30.587 --> 00:44:38.475]  ratios, you try to talk about derivatives, you talk about leveraged companies like J.P.
[00:44:38.515 --> 00:44:45.082]  Morgan with 80 plus trillion, 30 plus trillion Bank of America, 30 plus trillion Citigroup.
[00:44:46.423 --> 00:44:47.204]  They don't even know.
[00:44:47.484 --> 00:44:50.728]  You might as well be talking Martian or Octarian to them.
[00:44:51.559 --> 00:44:53.902]  You might as well be talking Palladian to these people.
[00:44:54.422 --> 00:44:59.467]  They don't even, they can't even understand us folks when you try to warn them, when you try to talk to them.
[00:44:59.748 --> 00:45:13.262]  That's what George Orwell talked about, where they've destroyed the language and the meaning of words to the point of, they know how to act tough at the steakhouse, they know how to act cool at the golf course, they know how to act cool with their buddies and act like know-it-alls and posture.
[00:45:14.409 --> 00:45:24.113]  And they know how to run around talking about Islamic fascists and sticking NRA stickers all over their cars, not knowing that group literally was the fathers of the first gun control and the new gun control bill.
[00:45:25.094 --> 00:45:31.957]  They just can't believe that the illusion that they were sold was a fraud.
[00:45:32.857 --> 00:45:35.538]  And the people do perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:45:35.858 --> 00:45:38.459]  Knowledge is the key to power.
[00:45:38.619 --> 00:45:42.241]  And by power, the power to live your own life and be left alone and be successful.
[00:45:44.269 --> 00:45:48.256]  There is no doubt that things are worse than I even thought and moving quicker than I thought.
[00:45:48.296 --> 00:45:49.839]  I tried to say it'd be middle of next year.
[00:45:49.899 --> 00:45:54.446]  The next year after that I try to push it off and try to put perfume on a pig.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.981]  But you can dress it up however you want.
[00:45:57.021 --> 00:45:58.682]  We're hurtling towards World War III.
[00:45:59.203 --> 00:46:01.644]  We're hurtling towards total devaluation of the dollar.
[00:46:02.084 --> 00:46:04.126]  We're hurtling towards government-sponsored terror.
[00:46:04.506 --> 00:46:05.747]  The FEMA camps are built.
[00:46:06.127 --> 00:46:07.888]  The wannabe dictators are in power.
[00:46:08.208 --> 00:46:09.569]  Hillary's waiting in the wings.
[00:46:09.849 --> 00:46:11.751]  The talk show hosts are bought and paid for.
[00:46:12.131 --> 00:46:16.193]  And we are plummeting down into absolute despotism.
[00:46:16.554 --> 00:46:21.717]  And I just don't want that for my family and my children, or for anybody else's family for that matter.
[00:46:22.217 --> 00:46:24.678]  Because I've got my head screwed on straight, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:25.059 --> 00:46:30.581]  And I know that if bad things are happening to other people overseas, it's going to come back on me, even if I fought it.
[00:46:31.222 --> 00:46:32.222]  That's the way it works.
[00:46:32.862 --> 00:46:34.963]  And I know we've aborted 50 million babies.
[00:46:35.504 --> 00:46:40.926]  And I know we've killed tens of thousands of children in radiation experiments and troops.
[00:46:41.366 --> 00:46:45.328]  And I know, I say we, we're all part of this sick system over here.
[00:46:45.809 --> 00:46:50.671]  We took the freest, greatest nation in history and turned it into nothing but a burnout cesspit.
[00:46:53.405 --> 00:46:54.065]  And I'm bracing!
[00:46:54.605 --> 00:47:00.527]  It's just like when I was driving down the road from visiting family out in Fredericksburg, and we hit Stonewall, about to go into Johnson City.
[00:47:00.928 --> 00:47:04.909]  It was raining real hard, the wind was blowing real hard, and I slowed down from 60 down to 45.
[00:47:05.449 --> 00:47:10.971]  We were driving down with a 30-foot embankment on each side, and all of a sudden, a tornado came through and shoved us right off the road.
[00:47:11.251 --> 00:47:17.373]  And those three seconds before we slammed into those oak trees, and it crushed half the car in, it just gave us concussions, thank God.
[00:47:17.413 --> 00:47:18.033]  It would have killed us.
[00:47:18.053 --> 00:47:19.314]  It would have hit us on the side.
[00:47:20.316 --> 00:47:29.022]  Those three seconds were like three minutes, and I remember in slow motion hearing myself say, brace for impact.
[00:47:29.883 --> 00:47:35.707]  And the steering wheel bending, we hit so hard, and the seats we were in, breaking from the shock.
[00:47:38.684 --> 00:47:38.945]  I don't know.
[00:47:56.497 --> 00:48:03.519]  It's the exact same thing, but instead of three seconds being three minutes, it's like a couple months, a couple weeks being like years.
[00:48:03.559 --> 00:48:07.320]  I'm just sitting here going, oh no!
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:08.860]  Brace for impact!
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:14.042]  I mean, just multiple torpedo salvos coming in, and I'm just screaming, brace for impact!
[00:48:14.082 --> 00:48:17.322]  And the yuppies are dancing around going, it's limo fascist!
[00:48:17.402 --> 00:48:18.523]  It's limo fascist!
[00:48:19.663 --> 00:48:28.413]  Central bankers have totally gutted the country, totally set us up for collapse, funded all the Islamic extremists, documented history, hijackers train at U.S.
[00:48:28.473 --> 00:48:36.623]  bases, publicly on the payroll, public attack, I'm real Tom Figg, I've gotten, I frankly don't even like it, but I have to just continue to commit to this fight.
[00:48:43.135 --> 00:48:49.340]  Burr Grace for Impact!
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:50.821]  Boom!
[00:48:56.125 --> 00:49:07.854]  But once it hits... I was in another car at one time where the car flipped three times when I was a teenager and we were like acting like idiots racing across the bridge across the lake from Rockwall into Dallas
[00:49:12.478 --> 00:49:13.559]  I shouldn't even tell these stories.
[00:49:13.739 --> 00:49:14.980]  I remember that slow motion.
[00:49:15.661 --> 00:49:24.008]  But the Corvette in front of us that crashed, they didn't have their seatbelts on, and I saw them spinning through the air as the car was flipping end over end.
[00:49:24.128 --> 00:49:26.470]  Out the window, I could see it in slow motion.
[00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.211]  Our brains are incredible, folks.
[00:49:28.611 --> 00:49:34.356]  Well, it's the same thing, but instead it's weeks and months stretched out, and I'm seeing it race for impact, and it's like a hundred years.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.142]  And all I want to do
[00:49:46.067 --> 00:49:50.429]  All I want to do is try to warn people.
[00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:51.730]  All I want to do
[00:50:00.723 --> 00:50:01.584]  Is warn you.
[00:50:01.664 --> 00:50:03.085]  I mean, it's a simple instinct.
[00:50:03.425 --> 00:50:14.312]  It's like, I live up the hill 10 miles, and I see the big dam break, and I got a helicopter, and I jump in it, or I jump on the radio, better analogy, and I tell people down in the valley, hey, listen, the dam broke.
[00:50:14.332 --> 00:50:17.114]  There's 20 feet of water coming at you at 60 miles an hour.
[00:50:17.654 --> 00:50:19.376]  Run for your lives, and they just giggle.
[00:50:21.797 --> 00:50:28.822]  Because it's just... And I know that when they set off attacks and launch wars, those...
[00:50:30.049 --> 00:50:33.510]  A bunch of people will rally around these killers again and they just get away with it.
[00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:36.771]  The good news is people know now.
[00:50:36.811 --> 00:50:41.632]  They're waking up though and at least we're not going to go quietly into the night.
[00:50:41.672 --> 00:50:44.832]  We're not going to completely submit to all of this.
[00:50:45.773 --> 00:50:47.013]  We're going to go down with a fight.
[00:50:48.193 --> 00:50:49.413]  With God's help, maybe even win.
[00:50:50.134 --> 00:50:50.594]  Stay with us.
[00:50:50.634 --> 00:50:53.014]  We'll be right back here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:58.985 --> 00:51:00.386]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:00.406 --> 00:51:02.508]  A new world order.
[00:51:03.228 --> 00:51:07.471]  In the near future, birth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:08.132 --> 00:51:09.873]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[00:51:10.153 --> 00:51:13.195]  Isn't their objective being world domination?
[00:51:13.736 --> 00:51:16.198]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:16.918 --> 00:51:24.264]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:27.253 --> 00:51:32.274]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:32.694 --> 00:51:36.175]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:36.575 --> 00:51:39.096]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:39.136 --> 00:51:40.276]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:40.316 --> 00:51:41.076]  They're not after money.
[00:51:41.096 --> 00:51:42.156]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:42.376 --> 00:51:42.796]  They're after power.
[00:51:42.816 --> 00:51:44.037]  That's what happens.
[00:51:44.497 --> 00:51:52.698]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:52.878 --> 00:51:55.519]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:55.999 --> 00:51:57.241]  You have been warned.
[00:51:58.041 --> 00:51:58.822]  Terrorism.
[00:51:58.962 --> 00:51:59.723]  Terrorism.
[00:51:59.823 --> 00:52:05.890]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:07.732]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:52:07.972 --> 00:52:10.475]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:10.855 --> 00:52:17.142]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Axitarism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne
[00:52:17.162 --> 00:52:18.263]  We're good to go.

[00:52:57.779 --> 00:52:59.720]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach!
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:00.420]  Look!
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:01.900]  Up there in the sky!
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.641]  It's Non-X-Man!
[00:53:04.021 --> 00:53:05.181]  He's in a dive!
[00:53:05.481 --> 00:53:07.482]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach!
[00:53:07.762 --> 00:53:08.522]  Let's go look!
[00:53:10.762 --> 00:53:13.963]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel!
[00:53:14.363 --> 00:53:15.704]  Stop hiding them in the sand!
[00:53:15.904 --> 00:53:16.344]  Take them out!
[00:53:16.972 --> 00:53:17.652]  Let's see.
[00:53:17.672 --> 00:53:22.233]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[00:53:22.613 --> 00:53:23.094]  Don't worry.
[00:53:23.534 --> 00:53:25.034]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:53:25.674 --> 00:53:30.095]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[00:53:30.616 --> 00:53:32.676]  Oh, I will Non-X Man.
[00:53:32.816 --> 00:53:35.517]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[00:53:37.658 --> 00:53:40.300]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.262]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[00:53:44.762 --> 00:53:56.009]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[00:53:58.831 --> 00:54:01.773]  We met other whistleblowers on the side of the road in Maryland.
[00:54:03.018 --> 00:54:04.940]  You know, to hear what they could tell us.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.702]  None of them revealed state secrets to us, by the way.
[00:54:09.864 --> 00:54:22.275]  But they had information and basically the government knew, you know, other than the exact moment, they knew the date and the method of which the attacks were supposed to come.
[00:54:22.835 --> 00:54:25.378]  And none of this made it to mainstream media.
[00:54:25.918 --> 00:54:27.940]  None of it made it into the commission.
[00:54:28.581 --> 00:54:41.151]  And yet, again, all of your representatives on the day that the commission book came out were on their pulpits saying, what a fabulous job this commission has done, a real service to this nation.
[00:54:41.792 --> 00:54:44.414]  And it was anything but a service.
[00:54:44.474 --> 00:54:46.415]  It was a complete fabrication.
[00:54:47.696 --> 00:54:52.700]  Other than the exact, perhaps, time, you know, because planes don't always go off on time.
[00:54:54.241 --> 00:54:54.982]  They knew the date.
[00:54:55.222 --> 00:54:56.103]  They knew the method.
[00:54:56.761 --> 00:54:58.582]  That it's going to be with airplanes?
[00:54:59.543 --> 00:55:04.626]  We're going to be getting her on the show, Jersey Girl, Patty Kazzazza.
[00:55:06.327 --> 00:55:21.077]  Folks, I had a showing of Endgame Monday night at the Delamo Draft House, and these fellows who work for, let's just say the biggest internet technology company out there, had flown in all the way from San Francisco, two fellows and their girlfriends,
[00:55:22.623 --> 00:55:26.825]  And he told me the name of somebody who had rung a bell of a prominent FBI agent.
[00:55:26.865 --> 00:55:28.245]  He said, yeah, we work with this guy.
[00:55:29.186 --> 00:55:30.366]  He got fired from that.
[00:55:30.426 --> 00:55:32.087]  Now he's the head of our IT security.
[00:55:32.647 --> 00:55:35.128]  And he admits that he ran the terrorist cells.
[00:55:35.808 --> 00:55:36.929]  And the guys are real serious.
[00:55:37.089 --> 00:55:38.149]  So I went home and Googled his name.
[00:55:38.169 --> 00:55:39.390]  I'm like, oh, I remember this guy.
[00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:41.371]  Oh, yeah.
[00:55:41.431 --> 00:55:44.932]  Peter Lance wrote all about this, former ABC Nightly News producer.
[00:55:45.592 --> 00:55:46.693]  Wrote the book, Triple Cross.
[00:55:46.753 --> 00:55:47.453]  I got to get him on.
[00:55:49.354 --> 00:55:49.874]  And, uh,
[00:55:51.278 --> 00:55:54.460]  Right there, just there it was, and it was even in the news.
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:56.621]  See, I mean, there's so much, I don't even know it all.
[00:55:57.401 --> 00:55:59.523]  It's just all hidden in plain view, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:00.883 --> 00:56:02.504]  I mean, do we know exactly what happened that day?
[00:56:02.604 --> 00:56:02.884]  No.
[00:56:03.605 --> 00:56:04.605]  Do we know they were all U.S.
[00:56:04.645 --> 00:56:05.286]  government agents?
[00:56:05.326 --> 00:56:07.207]  Have I interviewed the embassy heads who were ordered to let them in?
[00:56:07.227 --> 00:56:08.427]  They were CIA officers?
[00:56:09.588 --> 00:56:10.889]  CIA officers.
[00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.929]  Officers.
[00:56:14.191 --> 00:56:14.651]  Officers.
[00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:16.652]  ATTA and all of them.
[00:56:18.288 --> 00:56:20.969]  Yeah, I was just wondering what I could do to help Ron Paul in Iowa.
[00:56:21.069 --> 00:56:23.389]  Make sure he makes the debates.
[00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:50.711]  We're good to go.
[00:57:02.898 --> 00:57:06.221]  There's no one I can talk to about the debates though?
[00:57:06.301 --> 00:57:09.564]  They're talking about banning him and we have the article up on JonesReport.com.
[00:57:09.885 --> 00:57:19.614]  Call the Republican Party traitors of Iowa and just let those slime bags know that everybody knows he's a first tier candidate and how dare them even discuss it.
[00:57:21.375 --> 00:57:24.598]  Maybe some of them are good on there, I'm not saying they're all bad, but just the discussing is bad.
[00:57:26.846 --> 00:57:27.727]  No number I can call?
[00:57:27.947 --> 00:57:29.508]  You don't have it on you?
[00:57:29.908 --> 00:57:30.969]  Actually, I do have it here.
[00:57:31.669 --> 00:57:32.249]  Let me dig it out.
[00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:34.531]  I'm saying you can just go to JonesReport.com.
[00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:35.491]  Do you have a computer, sir?
[00:57:35.511 --> 00:57:37.433]  No, I'm on it though.
[00:57:38.353 --> 00:57:45.317]  Okay, Republican Party of Iowa, 515-282-808.
[00:57:45.338 --> 00:57:48.219]  I can't.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:49.620]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:52.442]  Let me just give it to you on air, okay?
[00:57:54.627 --> 00:57:56.128]  515.
[00:57:54.787 --> 00:57:56.128]  It's hard to spoon feed here, folks.
[00:57:56.168 --> 00:57:57.468]  I just don't have the time for it.
[00:57:57.488 --> 00:57:57.969]  515-282-8105.
[00:57:58.089 --> 00:58:01.451]  I'm just too tired to put up an act, folks.
[00:58:01.731 --> 00:58:04.513]  I just don't have time to play games anymore.
[00:58:04.533 --> 00:58:04.773]  515-282-8105, okay?
[00:58:04.793 --> 00:58:05.153]  There it is.
[00:58:05.173 --> 00:58:06.014]  There's conflicting reports.
[00:58:17.156 --> 00:58:18.736]  Maybe in the third hour we have time to get into that.
[00:58:18.756 --> 00:58:21.057]  We've got a guy in the mid-90s.
[00:58:21.117 --> 00:58:22.417]  I'm a big football fan.
[00:58:22.477 --> 00:58:26.098]  I just attacked it because it becomes a distraction from serious issues.
[00:58:26.138 --> 00:58:27.298]  But I was a fan.
[00:58:27.318 --> 00:58:28.718]  A bunch of people in my office are.
[00:58:28.738 --> 00:58:30.359]  You know, we're Dallas Cowboy fans around here.
[00:58:31.939 --> 00:58:33.780]  For this fella that's coming up later.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.700]  So stay with us.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:42.541]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:48.376 --> 00:58:48.616]  Hi.
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:54.880]  Big Brother.
[00:58:55.521 --> 00:58:56.621]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:57.302 --> 00:58:58.403]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:59.043 --> 00:58:59.884]  You want answers?
[00:59:00.644 --> 00:59:01.525]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:01.545 --> 00:59:05.847]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:06.388 --> 00:59:10.510]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:11.071 --> 00:59:16.915]  Now into our number two, Dr. Michael Kaufman, coming up here in about 10 minutes or so.
[00:59:18.291 --> 00:59:18.852]  Hello, bro.
[00:59:18.892 --> 00:59:19.612]  You're ever in our prayers.
[00:59:19.632 --> 00:59:22.794]  I understand you're being distraught, as am I. I am heartbroken.
[00:59:48.752 --> 00:59:56.018]  I've heard about the Reese Commission and I've looked online and had a bit of difficulty finding a concise summary.
[00:59:56.699 --> 01:00:04.345]  The former State Director of the John Birch Society told me there were like 4,000 pages of documents regarding this.
[01:00:05.579 --> 01:00:07.980]  And I don't know what it is, just in a nutshell, tell them.
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:20.885]  Well, basically, there was an investigation back in the fifties of the non-profit organizations, primarily the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, that they were like, they're up to something.
[01:00:21.945 --> 01:00:24.546]  And who was the head staffer on that?
[01:00:24.606 --> 01:00:25.646]  He's real famous.
[01:00:25.987 --> 01:00:27.507]  I interviewed him before he died.
[01:00:27.567 --> 01:00:29.628]  There's a two hour... Was that a Dodd?
[01:00:30.048 --> 01:00:30.328]  Yes.
[01:00:30.848 --> 01:00:32.009]  No, that was Senator Dodd.
[01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.369]  No, no, no.
[01:00:32.409 --> 01:00:32.709]  There was a...
[01:00:36.202 --> 01:00:41.690]  Yeah, he was like 90 years old and gave a pretty cogent interview before he died.
[01:00:41.751 --> 01:00:43.293]  It's on Google.
[01:00:43.813 --> 01:00:45.035]  I just can't remember his name.
[01:00:51.641 --> 01:00:53.962]  Hidden in plain sight kind of agenda.
[01:00:53.982 --> 01:01:06.410]  Yeah, the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, as early as the 20s, and the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, see, the billions of dollars, that was billions 80 years ago, 90 years ago, they all went tax free.
[01:01:07.551 --> 01:01:14.615]  And then they used their, their mansions are owned by the foundation, their helicopters, their oil companies, it's all tax free.
[01:01:15.467 --> 01:01:19.970]  Just like the Gates, Bill and Melinda Gates things now tax-free, all 60-something trillion of it.
[01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:21.571]  Well, no, it's more than 60 trillion.
[01:01:21.591 --> 01:01:22.771]  It's 70-plus trillion now.
[01:01:23.332 --> 01:01:23.952]  Keeps growing.
[01:01:24.733 --> 01:01:27.974]  And it's all tax-free, and they publicly say they're going to set up world government.
[01:01:28.395 --> 01:01:29.415]  I have read the documents.
[01:01:29.495 --> 01:01:31.356]  I've interviewed the people that were staffers on it.
[01:01:31.376 --> 01:01:35.239]  They're all dead now, but being around 12, 13 years, I interviewed a few of them before they died.
[01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:38.961]  And yeah, I'd have to go back into all my files on that, but what specifically are you looking for?
[01:01:39.511 --> 01:01:47.473]  Well, yeah, the thing is that they would use the instrumentality of war, which I gather means the opening of the purse strings, the false sense of peace.
[01:01:47.513 --> 01:01:52.934]  Yeah, that's the Carnegie Foundation for Peace saying they would use war to bring in their world government, yeah.
[01:01:53.014 --> 01:01:54.535]  Well, war is peace, of course.
[01:01:54.795 --> 01:01:57.155]  They said war is the great organizing factor.
[01:01:57.595 --> 01:01:57.815]  Right.
[01:01:58.055 --> 01:01:58.255]  Yeah.
[01:01:58.596 --> 01:02:04.657]  Yes, well, my website, I'll be the first to admit, is a wreck if doyoulovejesus.org, letter U,
[01:02:05.337 --> 01:02:26.466]  And I'm preparing a letter, in all fairness to Muslims, because I see this neoconsteady stream of vilification that it's like there's nobody being allowed to present the other side to say, wait a minute, these people, you know, it's the same old tactic of vilify somebody way over there.
[01:02:26.486 --> 01:02:31.869]  It's like, well, we need to deal with the problem here before we have any moral justification.
[01:02:33.476 --> 01:02:37.479]  I understand that Dr. Paul is a seasoned veteran of the political minefield.
[01:02:37.539 --> 01:02:43.483]  There's ammunition he doesn't use because I get the impression that if he did use it, it would
[01:02:44.229 --> 01:02:50.253]  They would distort it and make it sound like, well, he's crazy, like the Reeves Commission and the Grace Commission.
[01:02:51.014 --> 01:02:55.397]  Would you concur with that, that the reason why he doesn't use these certain... Well, he knows.
[01:02:55.437 --> 01:02:58.219]  I mean, he's talked about the tax-free foundations and the New World Order.
[01:02:58.259 --> 01:02:59.080]  He's introduced bills.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:00.441]  He's on TV.
[01:03:00.481 --> 01:03:03.443]  He knows he's talking to people that literally can't tie their shoelaces.
[01:03:03.943 --> 01:03:04.164]  Right.
[01:03:04.424 --> 01:03:05.665]  And so he dumbs it down.
[01:03:06.826 --> 01:03:12.770]  I take it these are... What he says about these things is available in his writings, then, right?
[01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:17.237]  Yes, and all the legislation he's introduced, and all of it.
[01:03:17.858 --> 01:03:18.038]  Yes.
[01:03:18.398 --> 01:03:22.982]  Well, you know that it is written, they refuse to love the truth and so be saved.
[01:03:23.102 --> 01:03:28.425]  And for a lot of people, it's that they don't want to deal with the truth when the truth is painful.
[01:03:28.465 --> 01:03:31.928]  This thing called godly sorrow is vitally important.
[01:03:32.368 --> 01:03:32.628]  I hear you.
[01:03:32.648 --> 01:03:33.329]  We've got to jump.
[01:03:33.389 --> 01:03:33.909]  We've got to go.
[01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:37.692]  But when you're in denial long enough, that leads to ruin.
[01:03:39.136 --> 01:03:41.517]  TruthNews.us is the new website.
[01:03:41.537 --> 01:03:42.338]  Be sure and check it out.
[01:03:42.378 --> 01:03:43.278]  TruthNews.us.
[01:03:43.398 --> 01:03:46.580]  We'll be right back with more of your calls and Dr. Michael Kaufman.
[01:03:50.302 --> 01:03:51.703]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:51.723 --> 01:03:53.824]  A new world order.
[01:03:54.544 --> 01:03:58.846]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful group of governments.
[01:03:59.447 --> 01:04:01.608]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:04:02.268 --> 01:04:04.489]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:07.451]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:15.537]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:18.568 --> 01:04:23.572]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:24.032 --> 01:04:27.494]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:27.895 --> 01:04:30.416]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:30.457 --> 01:04:31.597]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:32.338]  They're not after money.
[01:04:32.378 --> 01:04:33.479]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:33.679 --> 01:04:34.419]  They're after power.
[01:04:34.659 --> 01:04:35.800]  That's what they're after usually.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:40.363]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:04:40.563 --> 01:04:44.006]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:04:57.731 --> 01:05:00.871]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[01:05:49.159 --> 01:05:54.642]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:05:55.082 --> 01:05:59.305]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:05:59.745 --> 01:06:06.589]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:07.049 --> 01:06:13.732]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:14.052 --> 01:06:15.673]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:06:15.973 --> 01:06:19.155]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:06:19.435 --> 01:06:21.876]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:06:22.196 --> 01:06:23.337]  BioSolutions has over 550
[01:06:24.417 --> 01:06:24.917]  We're good to go.
[01:06:49.668 --> 01:06:54.711]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:55.072 --> 01:06:57.393]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:09.841]  Dr. Michael Conlin has a Ph.D.
[01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:11.282]  in Forest Ecology.
[01:07:11.302 --> 01:07:13.944]  He's a biologist and a...
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.301]  He was doing a multi-million dollar study for the U.S.
[01:07:17.341 --> 01:07:20.663]  government on the forest ecology of the entire U.S.
[01:07:20.723 --> 01:07:26.046]  and discovered that it wasn't about helping the earth, it was about taking control of property and controlling populations.
[01:07:26.906 --> 01:07:34.671]  That was back in the 80s and he helped shoot down the big biological diversity treaty that would have totally regulated everything that's happening.
[01:07:34.711 --> 01:07:36.512]  Now they're pushing man-made global warming.
[01:07:37.132 --> 01:07:41.074]  Certainly there's crises in the environment, but the sun is what's heating the earth.
[01:07:41.094 --> 01:07:42.015]  We've gone over that here.
[01:07:42.035 --> 01:07:42.635]  His new film
[01:07:43.985 --> 01:07:46.006]  Global Warming or Global Government.
[01:07:46.866 --> 01:07:48.526]  Available at LetInfoWars.com.
[01:07:48.967 --> 01:07:54.808]  And he's one of the big contributors to the new film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:07:55.469 --> 01:08:06.112]  And I would add to that, that I'm just now announcing this, in about two weeks, or on the 28th of November, we're going to release close to two hours.
[01:08:08.072 --> 01:08:09.293]  Really, you could call it Endgame 1.5.
[01:08:12.199 --> 01:08:21.429]  All of the interviews with Dr. Kaufman, Daniel Estillan, Jim Tucker, stuff at Brook Street, the police harassing us in Canada, things that we couldn't put in the film.
[01:08:21.450 --> 01:08:27.296]  I mean, right now it looks like more than two hours, but we'll see how much we end up, it might be three hours we put up, I'm not sure.
[01:08:27.797 --> 01:08:31.421]  But another reason to have a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, that is coming up the 28th!
[01:08:32.651 --> 01:08:33.032]  Yes, we are.
[01:08:44.938 --> 01:08:45.238]  Yes, we are.
[01:09:04.944 --> 01:09:05.224]  I don't know.
[01:09:23.371 --> 01:09:27.652]  I've been so busy I neglected to even mail him a copy, so we gave him a PrisonPlanet.tv code.
[01:09:28.012 --> 01:09:31.833]  He said he watched about two hours and ten minutes of the two-hour film and ran out of time last night.
[01:09:32.694 --> 01:09:34.594]  But Dr. Kaufman, what did you think of the film?
[01:09:35.354 --> 01:09:36.715]  I thought it was incredible.
[01:09:37.175 --> 01:09:37.815]  I really do.
[01:09:37.835 --> 01:09:46.858]  I think everyone that's listening to this needs to get a copy because it really defines what has been happening, how they're doing it, and what they're expecting to get in the future.
[01:09:47.098 --> 01:09:48.438]  And people need to wake up.
[01:09:49.145 --> 01:09:54.789]  It is one of the most earth-shattering DVDs I have ever seen in a truthful approach.
[01:09:54.829 --> 01:10:09.579]  You know, I have been in this now for almost 20 years, and everything that you're saying in there I know is either solid fact because I've researched it myself or have read enough to realize that there is that emphasis on that particular subject that I may not know as much about.
[01:10:10.259 --> 01:10:12.941]  And it is incredible what you have done with this, Alex.
[01:10:13.181 --> 01:10:15.243]  I just kind of fear for your safety.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:20.922]  Oh, I literally, you ever have that feeling?
[01:10:22.723 --> 01:10:27.565]  I certainly know that I've really crossed a line here, but I'm putting that all in God's hands.
[01:10:28.526 --> 01:10:41.032]  Breaking down the film, because you're a big part of it, walk through what you thought, seeing about 90% of it so far because you just got it yesterday, walk through the parts that you thought were most important, or give us your impromptu review.
[01:10:41.052 --> 01:10:46.635]  Boy, trying to define what's the most important is really tough, because I think it's all important.
[01:10:47.225 --> 01:11:01.231]  If you need to understand, and this may be the most important aspect, what the DVD does, if you can keep an open mind, if you're not really aware of the magnitude of what's going on in the world, it will be so shocking, it will almost make you physically sick.
[01:11:01.871 --> 01:11:09.914]  But at the same time, what it does, is it allows the person to see the magnitude of what they're attempting to do over an entire society.
[01:11:10.474 --> 01:11:16.737]  In all aspects of our society, what we do, the whole feminist movement, you name it,
[01:11:17.156 --> 01:11:31.184]  It's in there in one form or another, and it's all designed to break down the normal society controls and re-establish itself, what they want to do, as the new template for our culture and bringing the nations together as a world government.
[01:11:31.604 --> 01:11:35.046]  There's no question after you see this that this is exactly what they're trying to do.
[01:11:36.407 --> 01:11:40.309]  What I really was impressed with is how you have brought the various segments of this
[01:11:40.916 --> 01:11:46.959]  Using headlines of local papers and so forth to show what they're doing in putting all of this together.
[01:11:46.979 --> 01:11:52.921]  The average person can't see this because all they're seeing is little bits and pieces.
[01:11:53.402 --> 01:11:58.224]  They see this headline and they think, oh that's interesting, but they see it in an isolated context.
[01:11:58.244 --> 01:12:06.447]  What you have done is been able to put that together in a total, in a totality as it were, so that people can really begin to see how it all fits together.
[01:12:06.487 --> 01:12:08.028]  It's the first time I've ever seen that.
[01:12:09.088 --> 01:12:09.948]  Well, that's incredible.
[01:12:09.968 --> 01:12:28.754]  You know, we didn't talk before the show, and I haven't talked to you in a few months since you were last on, but that is exactly, and I never really even said that on air, that's what I was intending to do, was to give people the, you know, start to finish, just a wide view of what their ideology is, who they are, what their plan is, what drives them.
[01:12:29.934 --> 01:12:30.414]  Exactly.
[01:12:30.895 --> 01:12:31.375]  Exactly.
[01:12:31.395 --> 01:12:37.557]  And some of these, you only touch on, for instance, at least at this point, you only touched on global warming to some extent.
[01:12:37.597 --> 01:12:38.277]  My whole DVD
[01:12:39.316 --> 01:13:01.391]  Global warming or global governance really focuses on that one issue by itself and shows clearly how they have abused science and totally denied the opposition any voice in the media and so forth to push this agenda so that they can get those controls that will come with the carbon taxes and caps and so forth that is inevitable.
[01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:04.933]  It's going to happen in the next several years, how those controls will control us.
[01:13:06.254 --> 01:13:08.676]  And you've done that with so many aspects of this
[01:13:09.255 --> 01:13:09.815]  Well, that's it.
[01:13:09.835 --> 01:13:16.698]  I mean, we did spend a lot of time on eugenics and then all the thousands of admissions of where they've killed U.S., British, and other citizens in admitted tests.
[01:13:35.262 --> 01:13:43.145]  I mean, that shows the cold-bloodedness and how it's all done scientifically, though, but as if we have the same value as a white lab rat.
[01:13:44.006 --> 01:13:45.066]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:13:45.126 --> 01:13:46.707]  Now, eugenics isn't my specialty.
[01:13:46.787 --> 01:13:55.691]  I'm not real knowledgeable in that area, but I have read enough material to know that what you're saying is factual, and it's taken me deeper into that area.
[01:13:55.711 --> 01:13:58.512]  It's given me some additional information, and you'll find this.
[01:13:59.091 --> 01:14:03.692]  Individually, you can't possibly understand everything in this global agenda.
[01:14:04.112 --> 01:14:05.492]  No one person really can.
[01:14:05.552 --> 01:14:06.172]  Well, that's right.
[01:14:06.212 --> 01:14:12.653]  I mean, you could study one pine tree, as you know, that's your specialty, for your whole life and never know everything about that pine tree.
[01:14:12.993 --> 01:14:17.654]  We read, more than one guy here in the office, read 20 books by these people.
[01:14:17.714 --> 01:14:18.574]  I read about 10.
[01:14:19.074 --> 01:14:20.435]  We went to libraries.
[01:14:20.615 --> 01:14:27.116]  And exactly, I mean, you're talking about hundreds of thousands of globalists and their minions and their whole lives' works.
[01:14:27.816 --> 01:14:28.656]  I mean, it's just...
[01:14:31.082 --> 01:14:31.823]  It's so big.
[01:14:32.184 --> 01:14:33.346]  That's the point I want to make.
[01:14:34.448 --> 01:14:39.938]  We didn't even... People say, oh, this is really dark, or this is really... You might have exaggerated.
[01:14:39.978 --> 01:14:40.620]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.403]  It's thousands of times worse.
[01:14:43.129 --> 01:14:44.050]  I mean, it really is.
[01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:53.695]  I cannot explain to you what would you say in all your years of research about the globalists and the UN Biological Diversity Assessments where they openly talk about exterminating the majority of us and reducing us.
[01:14:54.275 --> 01:15:03.040]  I mean, as you were discovering that, what was it like for you realizing, my gosh, these people are nuts, they're psychopaths, they believe they're good, and they're in power.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:04.580]  Exactly.
[01:15:05.161 --> 01:15:09.183]  I went from one state of shock to another, and you know, what you have just said is very true.
[01:15:09.775 --> 01:15:26.901]  You start opening up this can of worms, and you think you have a handle on what's going on, and then you find out there's another dimension to it, and another dimension to it, and another dimension to it, and it gets worse, and worse, and worse, and I don't even think you probably plumbed the depths of deprivation that these people are in.
[01:15:27.442 --> 01:15:29.182]  They are evil incarnate.
[01:15:29.222 --> 01:15:30.903]  There's no other way that you can describe them.
[01:15:30.983 --> 01:15:33.964]  And yet, they believe that they are doing the right thing.
[01:15:36.539 --> 01:15:51.810]  Doc, I want to talk about your video that's doing incredibly well because it's so well documented, and I want to go to the basics of global warming is happening, but it's sun-driven and also particle-driven from space, solar winds, but where do you see all this going?
[01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:55.873]  I mean, do you feel the same anxiousness I feel, and everybody else feels, that it's accelerating?
[01:15:56.173 --> 01:15:57.674]  And where do you see this going?
[01:15:58.935 --> 01:16:01.597]  I really see, in the next two years,
[01:16:02.236 --> 01:16:03.938]  Something precipitous is going to happen.
[01:16:03.978 --> 01:16:11.446]  In fact, David Rockefeller and Kissinger and others have actually said that they need a precipitous event to tip us over the edge.
[01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:22.638]  9-11 got us prepared and we got the Patriots Act and so forth put into place because of that and now they need a precipitous event in which they can
[01:16:23.863 --> 01:16:27.787]  Use our fear against us, and will that bring us some sort of an answer?
[01:16:27.927 --> 01:16:30.129]  I think it's going to be an economic crisis of some sort.
[01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:32.831]  I mean, we're running the brink of it right now anyway.
[01:16:33.692 --> 01:16:40.938]  And they have the only solution, and to do that we have to give up even more, and it's going to put us over on the other side of that slope.
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:44.341]  I think it's very close.
[01:16:44.561 --> 01:16:45.142]  Well, I agree.
[01:16:45.162 --> 01:16:49.586]  They see us as a disease, and so that's the perfect rationale for a thug
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:53.661]  Or a group of killers is just to say, oh, well, they're animals anyways.
[01:16:53.701 --> 01:16:54.641]  That's what they always do.
[01:16:55.081 --> 01:16:57.521]  They did that with black slaves out of Africa saying they weren't human.
[01:16:58.022 --> 01:16:59.642]  I mean, you've been to these global meetings.
[01:16:59.662 --> 01:17:00.622]  You've covered these people.
[01:17:01.862 --> 01:17:02.763]  I've been to some of them.
[01:17:03.183 --> 01:17:10.804]  They literally look like cult members, you know, who have that wide-eyed look and are almost pious, very religious.
[01:17:10.884 --> 01:17:14.445]  I mean, they almost act like they're holy or something.
[01:17:15.377 --> 01:17:20.840]  Well, I'm glad you brought that point up because I want to emphasize the one thing that you did not emphasize very much.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.581]  You alluded to it a couple of times.
[01:17:23.522 --> 01:17:25.423]  This whole thing is occult driven.
[01:17:26.043 --> 01:17:29.044]  They are very deeply into the occult.
[01:17:29.105 --> 01:17:37.289]  They believe in theosophy and what Alice Bailey has done with that belief system of reaching godhood and so forth.
[01:17:37.938 --> 01:17:39.019]  They're really into that.
[01:17:39.099 --> 01:17:44.882]  They really do believe that they are gods, and they need to be able to control us, to get rid of most of us.
[01:17:44.922 --> 01:17:47.524]  They believe that the Earth is overpopulated.
[01:17:47.884 --> 01:18:01.112]  They need to eliminate two-thirds to three-quarters, eighty percent of the human population, of the dumber sect and so forth, as you and I. And then they'll be able to manage the world the way gods should be able to manage.
[01:18:01.692 --> 01:18:04.994]  It is really incredible, their mentality.
[01:18:05.526 --> 01:18:06.707]  When you really get down to it.
[01:18:06.767 --> 01:18:14.653]  Now, many of the people at these international meetings, when you enter these international meetings, it is like walking into the Twilight Zone.
[01:18:15.253 --> 01:18:19.236]  Any semblance to reality just slides right out the window at times.
[01:18:19.676 --> 01:18:27.122]  It's not always that way, but many times, it is like they start talking about different things in ways that just are not possible.
[01:18:28.523 --> 01:18:32.706]  Stay there, I want to talk about that on the other side, to understand our enemy, to understand their mindset.
[01:18:33.658 --> 01:18:37.624]  And then to realize how they're conning a lot of well-meaning people who do care about the environment.
[01:18:38.365 --> 01:18:42.371]  And how they're using this to totally control our human environment and put a tax on breathing.
[01:18:42.832 --> 01:18:43.593]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:43.613 --> 01:18:44.134]  Stay with us.
[01:18:49.932 --> 01:18:50.912]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:55.774]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:18:55.934 --> 01:19:03.737]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:19:04.017 --> 01:19:09.379]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:19:09.579 --> 01:19:16.561]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:19:16.861 --> 01:19:22.205]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:27.189]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:35.116]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:19:35.476 --> 01:19:41.721]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:19:42.021 --> 01:19:43.682]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:44.963 --> 01:19:48.166]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[01:20:42.195 --> 01:20:42.695]  Do it today!
[01:20:42.815 --> 01:20:43.196]  Hey Emily!
[01:20:43.356 --> 01:20:44.756]  Wow, you look great!
[01:20:44.776 --> 01:20:45.256]  I feel great!
[01:20:45.336 --> 01:20:46.137]  I've been using
[01:20:52.039 --> 01:20:53.400]  I'm using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:53.980]  Really?
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:54.620]  What is it?
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:55.300]  How does it work?
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:21:02.103]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[01:21:02.243 --> 01:21:04.524]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:21:04.744 --> 01:21:10.127]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:10.867]  That's it?
[01:21:11.167 --> 01:21:12.688]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:21:12.948 --> 01:21:13.648]  It is easy.
[01:21:13.848 --> 01:21:20.491]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:21:20.831 --> 01:21:22.351]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:21:22.652 --> 01:21:23.372]  That's amazing!
[01:21:23.752 --> 01:21:29.193]  And the Benzonite clay in MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:21:29.474 --> 01:21:29.774]  Wow!
[01:21:29.994 --> 01:21:31.094]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?

[01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:42.377]  Call today.
[01:21:48.639 --> 01:21:49.059]  Attention!
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.161]  This is an urgent GCN News Bulletin!
[01:21:51.361 --> 01:21:55.604]  Honeybees are now mysteriously vanishing at an astonishing pace across the entire country.
[01:21:55.784 --> 01:21:58.706]  Why is this urgent message about honeybees so desperately important?
[01:21:58.926 --> 01:21:59.887]  The answer is easy.
[01:22:00.027 --> 01:22:06.211]  You see, honeybees produce a unique compound, fed only to the queen, that makes her live six times longer than other bees in the hive.
[01:22:06.451 --> 01:22:10.494]  Some researchers now believe the compound may have miraculous effects on humans as well.
[01:22:10.694 --> 01:22:16.619]  The compound is called Royal Jelly, and is now available in an all-new, ultra-purified form called Gelosene Gold.
[01:22:16.819 --> 01:22:22.203]  The product has been designed for purity-cautious Americans who are concerned about contaminated Royal Jelly entering the U.S.
[01:22:22.243 --> 01:22:22.723]  from Asia.
[01:22:22.924 --> 01:22:27.267]  Solutions from Science is the only company authorized to sell Gelosene Gold in the U.S.
[01:22:27.507 --> 01:22:31.430]  They believe it to be the purest, most potent, and safest form of Royal Jelly in the world.
[01:22:31.690 --> 01:22:32.150]  I think so.
[01:23:12.128 --> 01:23:12.889]  Welcome back.
[01:23:13.029 --> 01:23:14.289]  Dr. Michael Kaufman is our guest.
[01:23:14.309 --> 01:23:22.634]  We'll be taking your calls on the whole globalist move for global taxation coming up in the next segment of 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:24.335 --> 01:23:32.500]  We've got legendary Dallas Cowboy Mark Sibnoski joining us to talk about 9-11 truth and a lot more in the next hour as well.
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:35.022]  So a lot more information lined up for you.
[01:23:35.817 --> 01:23:48.089]  Doctor, again, the mindset of these people, they think they're doing holy work, but then you also study them, they also think darkness is wonderful and beautiful, as well as light.
[01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:49.551]  They, quote, embrace it all.
[01:23:49.611 --> 01:23:50.011]  Go ahead.
[01:23:50.031 --> 01:23:51.813]  Yes, they do.
[01:23:51.973 --> 01:23:59.280]  In fact, one of the things that is very prominent with the whole concept of theosophy is what is known as the
[01:24:00.633 --> 01:24:02.075]  We're good to go.
[01:24:16.155 --> 01:24:31.702]  And as a consequence, what that does is it always keeps people off their guard, that they have to join the system in order to have these truths revealed to them, which is totally antithetical to a Christian society that we originally established this nation on.
[01:24:31.722 --> 01:24:37.845]  It doesn't exist anymore, but we originally established this nation on, which was open truth.
[01:24:38.365 --> 01:24:41.486]  You have everything that you need to have right available to you.
[01:24:41.506 --> 01:24:43.287]  It's up to you to take it and run with it.
[01:24:44.111 --> 01:24:55.282]  With these secret societies, it's always a situation in which you have to prove yourself to be worthy of going to the next step in order to accept the next level of knowledge.
[01:24:55.622 --> 01:24:56.283]  This Gnosis.
[01:25:01.528 --> 01:25:03.169]  I mean, how do we stop these people?
[01:25:04.511 --> 01:25:06.392]  I think what you're doing is absolutely essential.
[01:25:06.432 --> 01:25:08.014]  You mentioned on the video that
[01:25:08.587 --> 01:25:11.528]  More and more people are becoming aware, and that is very true.
[01:25:11.748 --> 01:25:16.390]  I kind of take a look at what I produced on global warming or global governance.
[01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:24.633]  That's kind of an introductory DVD, as it were, as to the realization that we are having this drive towards global governance.
[01:25:24.673 --> 01:25:31.415]  I don't get into it very deep, because I'm trying to reach those people who believe that you and I are black helicopter nuts and so forth.
[01:25:31.455 --> 01:25:37.357]  Well, here you have really important people saying the same thing that we're saying, but on a much lighter level.
[01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:52.079]  And once they begin to expose, and that's one of the things that has encouraged me about this DVD, is that I'm getting feedback from people that have been seeing it, which they had no understanding of global governance, or if they did, they thought it was some sort of a nutcase conspiracy type of thing.
[01:25:52.679 --> 01:26:00.264]  All of a sudden realizing, because there it is right in front of them, with this global warming agenda, that the whole purpose is to create global governance, and they're angry.
[01:26:00.925 --> 01:26:04.527]  Now, once they're angry, you can take a DVD like Endgame,
[01:26:05.094 --> 01:26:06.475]  And really show them the breadth of it.
[01:26:06.515 --> 01:26:09.737]  Now they're going to go into a state of absolute shock when they see it.
[01:26:09.777 --> 01:26:10.558]  I mean, I did.
[01:26:10.618 --> 01:26:21.325]  I think everybody who has really investigated this could never believe the levels of what they have gone to to create this control over you and I and how long it's taken.
[01:26:21.345 --> 01:26:24.388]  I mean, it's taken multiple, multiple generations of men.
[01:26:24.428 --> 01:26:26.449]  That's why you have to understand it's the occult.
[01:26:26.469 --> 01:26:27.370]  You can't understand why
[01:26:28.431 --> 01:26:41.441]  A man would put so much of their efforts into an agenda which they would never see the fruition unless they realized it was a religious belief that they held that their future generations are going to benefit by what they're doing today.
[01:26:41.461 --> 01:26:46.064]  I agree, but also in the secular it's like a 250 year old university like Harvard or Yale
[01:26:51.821 --> 01:27:08.677]  The chancellors and people that own it and run it want to increase its power and wealth because they sit in the positions of power while they're over it, but then they also have a feeling towards the institution, a lot of times the patronage and nepotism for those beneath them, and so that's also how these institutions grow and maintain their activities.
[01:27:09.197 --> 01:27:16.544]  Absolutely, and it's very interesting as I've attended a lot of these international meetings, the vast majority of those who are attending
[01:27:17.305 --> 01:27:20.828]  I have no concept of what the final agenda is going to be.
[01:27:20.908 --> 01:27:23.169]  Even people who are in positions of power.
[01:27:23.490 --> 01:27:24.731]  You mentioned that in your DVD.
[01:27:24.771 --> 01:27:25.751]  They're compartmentalized.
[01:27:26.272 --> 01:27:27.373]  They're compartmentalized.
[01:27:27.573 --> 01:27:35.258]  They think that they are doing the right thing, because people who are more important than they are, are telling them that they're doing the right things, and they can see the fruits.
[01:27:35.459 --> 01:27:45.486]  You know, socialism, the only reason socialism could survive, is the promise that if you did this, created all men equal and so forth, or treated all men equally, not created all men equally,
[01:27:45.826 --> 01:27:48.748]  Then somehow this is going to bloom into a utopian society.
[01:27:48.788 --> 01:27:54.131]  But for that model, you've got to have command and control and somebody over the individual.
[01:27:54.431 --> 01:27:56.453]  Now you've lost the individual and that's the trick.
[01:27:56.753 --> 01:27:59.855]  Now you've gotten a system where higher-ups can control you.
[01:28:00.735 --> 01:28:01.295]  Absolutely.
[01:28:01.776 --> 01:28:02.256]  Absolutely.
[01:28:02.356 --> 01:28:08.180]  Socialism is the unique way of gaining control over the population because it does exactly what you're saying.
[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:15.204]  And of course the British monarchs literally funded and developed it, Lord Milner and the rest of them, as a way to get people back into serfdom.
[01:28:16.087 --> 01:28:16.327]  Yes.
[01:28:16.987 --> 01:28:18.248]  And people don't realize that.
[01:28:18.268 --> 01:28:20.028]  That's why we're losing our middle class right now.
[01:28:21.649 --> 01:28:22.149]  Absolutely.
[01:28:22.169 --> 01:28:25.771]  Let's come back and talk about the real environmental problems we've got.
[01:28:25.871 --> 01:28:27.531]  What's really causing the earth to heat up?
[01:28:27.591 --> 01:28:28.472]  Is that bad or good?
[01:28:28.852 --> 01:28:32.253]  And then take phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:32.633 --> 01:28:41.416]  Big discounts at InfoWars.com on Dr. Michael Kauffman's new documentary presentation, Global Government or... We're on the march.
[01:28:41.876 --> 01:28:43.397]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:44.406 --> 01:28:47.090]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:50.114 --> 01:28:52.797]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:28:53.097 --> 01:28:55.159]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:28:55.379 --> 01:28:57.921]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:28:58.362 --> 01:29:02.725]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[01:29:02.846 --> 01:29:03.446]  Here's why.
[01:29:03.826 --> 01:29:10.092]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:29:10.372 --> 01:29:16.698]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[01:29:16.978 --> 01:29:20.702]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:25.167]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:29:25.627 --> 01:29:32.795]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:29:33.255 --> 01:29:35.638]  Get control, get relief, get some sleep!
[01:29:35.938 --> 01:29:36.939]  Go to www.outand90.com.
[01:29:36.979 --> 01:29:37.881]  That's www.outand90.com.
[01:29:38.021 --> 01:29:38.481]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:38.721 --> 01:29:38.962]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:29:49.756 --> 01:29:50.236]  Hi, Ken.
[01:29:50.276 --> 01:29:51.056]  It's Judy again.
[01:29:51.076 --> 01:29:55.598]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[01:29:55.738 --> 01:29:58.879]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[01:29:59.119 --> 01:30:00.979]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[01:30:00.999 --> 01:30:03.340]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:09.642]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[01:30:09.822 --> 01:30:15.124]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[01:30:15.384 --> 01:30:18.245]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[01:30:18.365 --> 01:30:19.285]  Go KenSolar!
[01:30:20.589 --> 01:30:22.110]  Get the best of both worlds.
[01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:27.654]  Solar power for your household essentials and a backup generator all in one.
[01:30:27.814 --> 01:30:29.215]  Perfect for hurricane seasons.
[01:30:29.235 --> 01:30:33.037]  No long gas lines, no fumes, and no noise.
[01:30:33.738 --> 01:30:36.420]  Lower your electric bill and be prepared year-round.
[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:39.402]  Complete solar kits for under $1,200.
[01:30:39.642 --> 01:30:43.745]  See the complete solar power generator kit at KenSolar.com.
[01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:47.727]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[01:30:49.455 --> 01:30:51.578]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:30:51.938 --> 01:30:55.002]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:30:55.262 --> 01:30:59.847]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:31:00.208 --> 01:31:02.831]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:31:03.311 --> 01:31:10.059]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:31:10.499 --> 01:31:15.722]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:31:16.182 --> 01:31:17.823]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:31:18.343 --> 01:31:21.625]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:31:22.185 --> 01:31:32.571]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the US was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[01:31:32.931 --> 01:31:38.334]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:31:38.654 --> 01:31:39.695]  Share the oil company's
[01:31:39.735 --> 01:31:40.375]  We're good to go.
[01:32:29.452 --> 01:32:32.914]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:32:32.994 --> 01:32:34.094]  until 2 p.m.
[01:32:34.555 --> 01:32:35.755]  Central Standard Time.
[01:32:35.775 --> 01:32:38.316]  We're here live when the show ends.
[01:32:38.336 --> 01:32:40.517]  If you missed the first hour, you can tune right back in.
[01:32:40.557 --> 01:32:44.839]  We restream it for 21 hours until the next live show at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:47.761]  You can subscribe, of course, to the free podcast.
[01:32:48.974 --> 01:32:50.835]  And Infowars.com.
[01:32:51.315 --> 01:32:56.676]  Again, I want to take time out to thank all of our sponsors, the listeners, the stations that carry us, AM, FM, shortwave, internet, satellite.
[01:32:57.156 --> 01:32:59.337]  And I want to thank people like Dr. Michael Coffin for coming on with us.
[01:32:59.357 --> 01:33:01.038]  We've got loaded phone lines here for you, Doc.
[01:33:01.478 --> 01:33:03.198]  And I want to take some, but I want to make it clear.
[01:33:04.019 --> 01:33:06.859]  Because I've talked to you in the past, and I know we're of the same mind, the same research.
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:08.960]  This is what you have degrees in.
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:09.860]  This is what you study.
[01:33:10.921 --> 01:33:15.522]  And thousands of other prominent scientists and university experts have gone public on this.
[01:33:16.747 --> 01:33:18.828]  We know that there's dioxin from the plastics.
[01:33:18.868 --> 01:33:20.590]  We know there's toxins and stuff in the air.
[01:33:20.650 --> 01:33:22.251]  We know there's bad things in the environment.
[01:33:22.291 --> 01:33:27.154]  Genetic engineering can be dangerous if it's released openly and in chimera-crossed species.
[01:33:27.614 --> 01:33:29.395]  There's a lot of serious things going on.
[01:33:30.856 --> 01:33:43.765]  But the globalists have openly stated they're using conservation and our concern about the Earth to set up world government, to set up total federalization, to have control over people locally, to control markets.
[01:33:44.924 --> 01:33:46.305]  And to control populations.
[01:33:46.945 --> 01:33:53.387]  And that we know that from 9,000 to 6,000 years ago, the earth was on average 10 degrees hotter.
[01:33:53.687 --> 01:33:56.188]  There were vineyards in southern and northern England.
[01:33:56.969 --> 01:33:58.389]  You can't grow grapes there now, folks.
[01:33:59.070 --> 01:34:01.130]  We know that that's when humanity blooms.
[01:34:01.170 --> 01:34:02.611]  We know that's when the plankton blooms.
[01:34:02.791 --> 01:34:07.973]  We know that oxygen with higher carbon dioxide creates more life.
[01:34:08.073 --> 01:34:10.554]  Carbon dioxide is not a toxic waste, as they're trying to list it.
[01:34:11.014 --> 01:34:12.855]  Two weeks ago, they set a coal plant
[01:34:13.829 --> 01:34:15.110]  Couldn't burn clean-burning coal.
[01:34:15.150 --> 01:34:16.571]  They locked that up, as you know.
[01:34:17.412 --> 01:34:18.252]  But they didn't sell them.
[01:34:18.272 --> 01:34:21.535]  They couldn't have a permit because of dirty coal and mercury, which I'm concerned about.
[01:34:21.815 --> 01:34:23.897]  They said, oh, carbon dioxide's a toxic waste.
[01:34:23.957 --> 01:34:24.677]  Permit denied.
[01:34:24.978 --> 01:34:25.998]  So that's a great control.
[01:34:26.058 --> 01:34:35.946]  Now they're talking about can't have a 3,000 square foot house without government regulators, new bureaucrats, taxes on fuel at every level, taxes on consumption, controlling us.
[01:34:37.368 --> 01:34:39.090]  Uh, and again, it sounds reasonable.
[01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:41.513]  Oh, we're consuming too much, but this is about control.
[01:34:41.533 --> 01:34:49.201]  These are very wicked people that want to get control, and as evil as the globalist are with these international bodies that pose as liberal organizations, they're not.
[01:34:50.021 --> 01:34:51.683]  Just as Bush poses as a conservative.
[01:34:52.764 --> 01:34:56.008]  They want global taxation to fully be able to bring in
[01:34:56.864 --> 01:34:59.425]  An even greater mechanism of control.
[01:34:59.766 --> 01:35:25.138]  So can you just explain the scientific facts in a nutshell of, surprise, surprise, that huge burning ball of different gases that we see up in the sky every day, that that's what's driving the prime mover in climate, as any climatologist will tell you, and that, I mean, you know, to claim the carbon dioxide that's been ten times higher in our past, and we've literally had a much higher life load, much healthier,
[01:35:26.118 --> 01:35:28.699]  I mean, it's so simple, and I'm not even a scientist.
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:30.700]  How could it not be clear?
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:31.841]  How could they fool the public?
[01:35:31.861 --> 01:35:34.562]  The answer is, one-fifth of the public can't find the U.S.
[01:35:34.622 --> 01:35:35.022]  on a map.
[01:35:36.023 --> 01:35:43.486]  They've done the test where you can put out on air the scientific name of water, and people will say, ban it.
[01:35:44.524 --> 01:35:46.806]  You can give out the scientific name of salt, they'll say bannet.
[01:35:47.506 --> 01:35:49.387]  And same with carbon dioxide.
[01:35:49.448 --> 01:35:52.129]  The word dioxide, they think it's carbon monoxide.
[01:35:52.970 --> 01:35:54.011]  Break it down for us, Doctor.
[01:35:54.791 --> 01:36:00.875]  Well, first of all, to keep it a simple thing, you've heard from Al Gore that CO2 causes the Earth to warm.
[01:36:01.836 --> 01:36:10.121]  He walks in front of this huge 40-foot screen showing you how there's this correlation between carbon dioxide, when carbon dioxide goes up, temperature goes up.
[01:36:10.142 --> 01:36:12.163]  When carbon dioxide goes down, temperature goes down.
[01:36:12.839 --> 01:36:16.122]  Well, there's a good correlation there alright, but the correlations mean nothing.
[01:36:16.922 --> 01:36:21.266]  100% of us are going to die if we breathe air.
[01:36:21.946 --> 01:36:27.451]  Not because we breathe air, but because there is a relationship there that has nothing to do with cause and effect.
[01:36:28.011 --> 01:36:31.574]  And this is the same thing with carbon dioxide and temperature, the Earth's temperature.
[01:36:32.034 --> 01:36:41.982]  In fact, if you were to actually superimpose the graph that he has separated, what you would find is that the temperature almost always precedes carbon dioxide, either going up or going down.
[01:36:42.646 --> 01:36:47.108]  And if anything, it's the temperature that causes the carbon dioxide levels to change.
[01:36:47.488 --> 01:36:47.788]  Why?
[01:36:47.908 --> 01:36:52.730]  Because there's 40,000 times more carbon dioxide in our oceans than in the air.
[01:36:53.010 --> 01:36:57.251]  And carbon dioxide will go out of solution at warmer temperatures.
[01:36:57.571 --> 01:37:05.434]  When the temperatures of the ocean get warmer, the carbon dioxide evaporates off into the atmosphere and the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide goes up.
[01:37:05.774 --> 01:37:10.676]  And conversely, when the oceans cool down, it absorbs more carbon dioxide and the atmospheric levels go down.
[01:37:11.258 --> 01:37:13.179]  So, it's very easy to explain.
[01:37:13.199 --> 01:37:21.805]  Just like you were saying a moment ago, there's good, hard, physical science behind it as to why temperature is causing carbon dioxide to change, not the reverse.
[01:37:22.346 --> 01:37:39.357]  Now, when you get to the actual information as to why the Earth is warming, a huge amount of research has been done over the last 10 years, and it's just coming to forefront right now, that shows that cosmic radiation from exploding supernovae thousands of light years away, when it finally reaches the Earth,
[01:37:40.077 --> 01:37:48.740]  That acts as what's called hydroscopic nuclei, that water droplets form around, in other words, clouds, specifically at the lower levels.
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:57.682]  Now, if you've ever flown in an airplane and you've flown over low clouds, it's almost impossible to look out at them because of their brilliance.
[01:37:57.742 --> 01:38:02.104]  So much sun is reflecting off the top of those clouds, it almost hurts your eyes to look at them.
[01:38:02.484 --> 01:38:03.664]  Well, this is called albedo.
[01:38:04.064 --> 01:38:08.526]  And albedo is the reflectance of the, direct reflectance of the solar radiation back out into space,
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:11.481]  Never reaches the Earth's surface.
[01:38:11.681 --> 01:38:15.805]  Therefore, lo and behold, and you've seen it every day, that it rains.
[01:38:16.065 --> 01:38:19.968]  It's colder under these clouds than it is when it's sunny outside.
[01:38:20.569 --> 01:38:27.534]  Now, every once in a while, on an 11 or 22 year cycle specifically, the Sun actually becomes more active.
[01:38:27.554 --> 01:38:31.397]  And when it does, it spews out solar winds.
[01:38:31.718 --> 01:38:38.423]  If you've ever seen the magnetic storms in the Aurora Borealis and so forth, that's what happens when you have a very active Sun.
[01:38:39.304 --> 01:38:39.464]  This
[01:38:40.311 --> 01:38:47.836]  See, solar winds have a tendency to push back this cosmic radiation right out of the sun's heliosphere, right out of our solar system.
[01:38:47.976 --> 01:38:56.922]  And as a consequence, when that happens, you have a situation where there is less clouds being formed because there's less cosmic radiation reaching the Earth's surface.
[01:38:57.762 --> 01:39:00.204]  Only 2-3% difference, but that's all it takes.
[01:39:00.604 --> 01:39:03.686]  You can account for all the global warming that we've had by 2-3%
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:14.223]  Reduction in our lower cloud levels over the last 50 to 100 years, and it's been demonstrated that this is almost a 95% correlation.
[01:39:14.243 --> 01:39:30.288]  But also, and in your film and other films document all the top scientists, they claim that 2,000 plus people signed on to that UN letter a few years ago, and it turned out that hundreds of scientists are saying, I wasn't even contacted, or I was contacted to give information, but I don't agree with this.
[01:39:30.668 --> 01:39:34.689]  But also, he claims that heating comes with carbon dioxide,
[01:39:35.289 --> 01:39:38.152]  But in the graphs, it's 200 to 600 years after.
[01:39:38.492 --> 01:39:47.800]  Carbon dioxide always follows heating, because heating causes photoplankton and plant blooms, which then increase carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:58.230]  It's an absolute ice core, and every other sampling, NASA sampling, that carbon dioxide follows warming, because a plant life-forms
[01:39:58.710 --> 01:40:02.873]  Exhaling in their respiration more carbon dioxide.
[01:40:02.893 --> 01:40:14.841]  I mean, it's a 2 plus 2 equals 4, but I can sit here and say to the public, how dare you, Dr. Michael Coffin, wanting to poison our children with hydrogen oxide?
[01:40:14.901 --> 01:40:19.164]  How dare you with deadly hydrogen oxide?
[01:40:19.785 --> 01:40:23.127]  Well, hydrogen oxide, tell them what hydrogen oxide is.
[01:40:23.467 --> 01:40:25.308]  Well, you can't live without hydrogen oxide.
[01:40:25.389 --> 01:40:25.829]  It's water.
[01:40:27.017 --> 01:40:28.939]  Uh, you can't live more than three or four days without it.
[01:40:29.599 --> 01:40:31.861]  And, you know, water will kill you if you drowned in it.
[01:40:32.501 --> 01:40:33.402]  It will kill you if you drink it.
[01:40:33.422 --> 01:40:39.207]  But, you know, they've gone out, different crews, and gone out to environmental, you know, fairs and walked up and said, we've got to ban this, sign our petition.
[01:40:39.447 --> 01:40:41.308]  Hydrogen and Oxide.
[01:40:41.869 --> 01:40:45.371]  And 90 plus percent, oh my gosh, oh, to ban it immediately.
[01:40:45.792 --> 01:40:48.254]  It's the same thing with Carbon Dioxide, folks.
[01:40:51.525 --> 01:40:52.065]  Oxygen.
[01:40:52.105 --> 01:40:52.946]  And two hydrogen.
[01:40:53.386 --> 01:41:00.368]  Yes, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water, H2O, are the three major building blocks.
[01:41:00.388 --> 01:41:07.611]  Then you add to that the energy of the sun, and those are the four total building blocks.
[01:41:07.711 --> 01:41:09.851]  Are those not the most important building blocks?
[01:41:10.452 --> 01:41:10.792]  Absolutely.
[01:41:10.812 --> 01:41:13.092]  I mean, there are many others too, but those are the big three.
[01:41:13.112 --> 01:41:14.193]  There's no question about it.
[01:41:14.893 --> 01:41:16.794]  You can't live without one of those.
[01:41:17.214 --> 01:41:20.415]  If one of those is missing, we would not have life on planet Earth.
[01:41:21.309 --> 01:41:24.571]  But how dare the plants spew this deadly waste?
[01:41:25.432 --> 01:41:30.755]  I mean, they're assaulting our children with deadly carbon dioxide!
[01:41:31.916 --> 01:41:43.503]  Well, you know, that's the other fallacy of this whole thing, is the fact that there's less than 1% of all the greenhouse gases that is made up of man-caused or man-emitted carbon dioxide.
[01:41:43.543 --> 01:41:45.064]  The rest of it is all natural.
[01:41:45.264 --> 01:41:46.285]  Even carbon dioxide.
[01:41:47.225 --> 01:41:47.986]  Carbon dioxide
[01:41:50.296 --> 01:41:54.358]  97% of it is naturally created by trees, plants, and other sundry things.
[01:41:54.438 --> 01:42:01.382]  But I mean, the botanists and experts have found that plants can grow three times faster, live longer, be healthier, they create higher oxygen.
[01:42:01.862 --> 01:42:09.046]  They've done studies and found that they believe that during the Hyborian Maxim 7,000 years ago, that humans were healthier because of higher oxygen.
[01:42:09.086 --> 01:42:10.027]  They've dug up the bones.
[01:42:11.988 --> 01:42:19.631]  A lot of scientists are saying that we're actually in a oxygen-starved, carbon dioxide-starved mode, and that carbon dioxide is mother's milk to life.
[01:42:20.531 --> 01:42:21.072]  Absolutely.
[01:42:21.492 --> 01:42:22.112]  It really is.
[01:42:22.132 --> 01:42:23.393]  It's amazing.
[01:42:23.413 --> 01:42:29.115]  There's been literally thousands of these studies being done to show that food production, for instance, can be doubled.
[01:42:30.184 --> 01:42:34.687]  Increased by 50% with a doubling of carbon dioxide, doubled with a tripling of carbon dioxide.
[01:42:34.727 --> 01:42:42.851]  And the oceans, the plankton do better, then the krill, then the shrimp, then the minnows, then the larger fish up to the bluefin tuna and the great whites.
[01:42:43.151 --> 01:42:45.452]  This would be good for the ocean, but they don't want it!
[01:42:46.373 --> 01:42:48.674]  They do not, well, it's not that they don't want it.
[01:42:48.954 --> 01:42:54.357]  They don't want us to know about it, because if we know about it, we'll know how much of a fool they are and we won't go along with their agenda.
[01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:59.033]  They're using this whole thing as an agenda item in order to enslave us.
[01:42:59.313 --> 01:43:01.835]  As you said in your DVD, there is no question of this.
[01:43:02.115 --> 01:43:10.922]  There is no viable science, and I'll say this in a hard and fast way, there is no direct science that shows that man is causing global warming.
[01:43:11.002 --> 01:43:15.746]  I have looked at literally thousands of research results, and there is none.
[01:43:15.986 --> 01:43:18.748]  There's a lot of circumstantial evidence, but so what?
[01:43:19.304 --> 01:43:30.207]  The hard evidence that we do have suggests that what we're seeing today is part of a natural cycle, and we're recovering from what is called the Little Ice Age, back in the 1700s and 1800s.
[01:43:30.307 --> 01:43:39.090]  It's a natural warming, and thank God, because back in the Little Ice Age, that's when you had the Black Plagues of Europe and mass starvation because crop failures and all the rest.
[01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:44.671]  Huge snowstorms is when the Thames River and London froze over every year.
[01:43:45.292 --> 01:43:46.712]  It was a horrible time.
[01:43:47.139 --> 01:43:48.240]  We're recovering from that.
[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:49.881]  We do not want to go back to that.
[01:43:49.961 --> 01:43:51.542]  Why do you want to hurt our children?
[01:43:51.662 --> 01:43:56.945]  Why do you want to hurt our children, Dr. Kaufman, wanting them to ingest the deadly poison sodium chloride?
[01:43:57.385 --> 01:44:01.968]  Well, that is unfortunately the only tactic they can use to try to discredit us.
[01:44:02.088 --> 01:44:04.089]  But sodium chloride is deadly!
[01:44:04.249 --> 01:44:04.889]  It's in poor people.
[01:44:04.909 --> 01:44:06.250]  Yes, ban sodium chloride.
[01:44:06.510 --> 01:44:07.851]  Tell folks what sodium chloride is.
[01:44:08.551 --> 01:44:08.812]  Salt.
[01:44:09.252 --> 01:44:10.032]  You eat it every day.
[01:44:10.413 --> 01:44:14.535]  Again, the scientific terms scare the buffoonish, dumbed-down public.
[01:44:15.097 --> 01:44:17.539]  I mean, 50 years ago, they would never have gotten away with this.
[01:44:17.559 --> 01:44:18.439]  People knew too much.
[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:19.360]  No.
[01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:20.200]  People knew too much.
[01:44:21.361 --> 01:44:26.364]  It was part of our high school education, if not our elementary education, and all that material has been taken out.
[01:44:26.884 --> 01:44:40.033]  Our history courses have been dumbed down to very mundane types of understanding of history, totally eliminating the concept of what private property rights mean to wealth creation and all the rest.
[01:44:40.633 --> 01:44:43.595]  You and I, when we grew up, well maybe not you, maybe you were too late,
[01:44:44.255 --> 01:44:47.477]  You're a lot younger than I am, but when I grew up, it was part of our curricula.
[01:44:47.537 --> 01:44:52.799]  We understood how important private property rights are, or how important this is, and that's not being taught anymore.
[01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:56.181]  Oh no, we were just taught that world government was good and handing in guns is good.
[01:44:56.421 --> 01:45:01.464]  I want to take some calls, but if folks want global warming or global government, your DVD film, it's available.
[01:45:02.333 --> 01:45:08.694]  At Infowars.com, you can also get it discounted with Endgame together as a combo pack on Infowars.com.
[01:45:08.714 --> 01:45:09.674]  It also makes a great gift.
[01:45:09.714 --> 01:45:10.835]  Let's say you know all about this.
[01:45:10.855 --> 01:45:16.196]  You're a scientist, you're a biologist, you're a researcher, you're a lay scientist, a tinkerer, you know these basics.
[01:45:16.236 --> 01:45:17.276]  Your neighbors don't, folks.
[01:45:17.736 --> 01:45:19.896]  They think sodium chloride is cyanide.
[01:45:21.377 --> 01:45:23.077]  They've done studies where they tell people that and they believe it.
[01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:26.718]  They believe that water, if you give them the scientific term, is poison.
[01:45:27.118 --> 01:45:27.818]  They believe that
[01:45:28.715 --> 01:45:33.776]  Carbon dioxide, literal main engine driver for all life, is plants of the basis.
[01:45:34.537 --> 01:45:36.057]  They're at the bottom of the food chain.
[01:45:36.077 --> 01:45:37.518]  They believe it's a devil gas.
[01:45:38.158 --> 01:45:41.919]  And again, they're treating us like ignorant morons, and it's got to stop.
[01:45:41.959 --> 01:45:49.241]  Please call 888-253-3139 to get in game, or Global Warming or Global Government.
[01:45:49.501 --> 01:45:52.722]  Get them today, 888-253-3139.
[01:45:52.742 --> 01:45:54.002]  Let's jam in some calls here.
[01:45:54.302 --> 01:45:56.643]  Don in Texas, you're on the air with Dr. Michael Kaufman.
[01:45:59.685 --> 01:46:07.454]  I'd like to return to the subject that you brought up, sir, of theosophy, and I'd like to comment on what Alex often says.
[01:46:07.975 --> 01:46:19.288]  It's not actually what we believe that's important, it's important what they believe, because they're actually making the moves off of their beliefs, so whether it's true or not, the fact that they believe that is very
[01:46:20.134 --> 01:46:20.614]  Exactly!
[01:46:20.654 --> 01:46:25.015]  Every time I talk about the globalist being a cultic, atheists send me emails going, I don't believe in that, you kook!
[01:46:25.415 --> 01:46:26.555]  Okay, it doesn't matter!
[01:46:26.795 --> 01:46:29.416]  Hitler wasn't a cultist, it doesn't mean you believe in that.
[01:46:29.616 --> 01:46:31.196]  The point is, that's what's driving him.
[01:46:31.416 --> 01:46:35.397]  You know, the hillside strangler, Mr. Satan, believed he was doing it for the devil.
[01:46:35.697 --> 01:46:40.318]  Even if you don't believe in the devil, he believes in you, and you know, he's Richard Ramirez, or whatever.
[01:46:41.038 --> 01:46:41.578]  Dr. Kaufman?
[01:46:42.538 --> 01:46:43.838]  Absolutely, I would agree with you.
[01:46:43.898 --> 01:46:47.019]  It's not what we believe, it's what they believe when they're in the seat of power.
[01:46:47.881 --> 01:46:52.365]  That they're going to impose on you and I. I mean, that's what a criminologist does, understand our enemies.
[01:46:52.585 --> 01:46:53.946]  We understand what makes them tick.
[01:46:55.148 --> 01:46:56.949]  That's exactly what I was going to say.
[01:46:56.989 --> 01:47:00.973]  You posed the question earlier, Alex, of how do we stop these guys?
[01:47:01.033 --> 01:47:06.838]  And I would contend that we should learn as much about what they believe as possible.
[01:47:07.319 --> 01:47:08.980]  However, that is a slippery slope.
[01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:10.822]  And doctor, I'd like for you to comment on this.
[01:47:11.702 --> 01:47:13.304]  Once you start learning about what
[01:47:13.968 --> 01:47:17.950]  They know there's so much disinformation within what they're learning.
[01:47:18.891 --> 01:47:35.121]  It seems to me that the root of theosophy and all of this occult stuff is a concept called star-seeding, and I'd like you to comment on this, that they actually believe that they are descendants of a cross between alien and the human species, and that is what separates them from the normal man.
[01:47:35.921 --> 01:47:39.223]  Yes, in fact, not all of them believe that necessarily, but I have read that.
[01:47:39.243 --> 01:47:40.404]  But we're hearing this a lot now.
[01:47:40.984 --> 01:47:41.885]  It's really popular.
[01:47:42.737 --> 01:47:42.997]  Yes.
[01:47:43.818 --> 01:47:47.520]  In fact, you have to, you know, the whole thing is set up by the concept of evolution.
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:49.701]  I'm not getting into an evolutionary discussion right now.
[01:47:50.242 --> 01:47:58.306]  But it's set up by evolution, and therefore, they are part of the new gene pool that was brought in from other planets and so forth.
[01:47:58.326 --> 01:48:00.307]  Well, that's even what the BBC is saying now.
[01:48:00.327 --> 01:48:01.588]  We're going to split into two groups.
[01:48:01.648 --> 01:48:03.429]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:05.250]  Robert in California, you're on the air.
[01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.651]  Go ahead.
[01:48:08.452 --> 01:48:09.133]  Good morning, gentlemen.
[01:48:10.541 --> 01:48:11.763]  Yeah, a couple of things.
[01:48:12.423 --> 01:48:18.071]  One is that I was doing some research on the terminology that you keep using, Luciferian.
[01:48:18.171 --> 01:48:22.798]  They believe in an evolutionary process from Homo sapien to Homo divinus.
[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:25.942]  Yeah, and that predates Darwin.
[01:48:26.042 --> 01:48:27.643]  See, Darwin didn't think any of this up.
[01:48:27.803 --> 01:48:29.444]  And we're not getting into... I agree.
[01:48:29.464 --> 01:48:32.066]  We're not having a debate about evolution, folks.
[01:48:32.286 --> 01:48:33.687]  We're telling what they believe.
[01:48:33.707 --> 01:48:34.648]  That's all we're doing.
[01:48:34.928 --> 01:48:36.689]  See, I don't even attack Darwin in this film.
[01:48:36.789 --> 01:48:38.050]  I just state what he believed.
[01:48:38.371 --> 01:48:40.092]  I show the documents, the books he wrote.
[01:48:40.112 --> 01:48:41.653]  Dr. Kaufman?
[01:48:42.914 --> 01:48:43.895]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:48:43.975 --> 01:48:47.257]  It is... Again, you have to understand what they believe.
[01:48:47.317 --> 01:48:49.719]  You know, I wrote the book, Saviors of the Earth, a number of years ago.
[01:48:49.739 --> 01:48:51.080]  It's still available on my website.
[01:48:51.892 --> 01:49:01.394]  I wrote that book trying to help people understand what is motivating the environmental movement and where it's coming from and what they believe in, because unless you understand what they believe in, you will not know where they're going.
[01:49:01.935 --> 01:49:11.277]  It's one of the reasons I was able to stop right an hour before the Senate was to vote on it, the Convention on Biological Diversity, because I knew exactly what they were trying to do.
[01:49:11.337 --> 01:49:12.457]  I explained it to the Senate.
[01:49:12.777 --> 01:49:15.938]  They didn't believe me, and I finally got the evidence, the smoking gun,
[01:49:17.108 --> 01:49:20.249]  The day before that they were supposed to vote on it and send it down to the U.S.
[01:49:20.269 --> 01:49:27.411]  Senate, and it was introduced on the Senate floor an hour before the scheduled vote for ratification of this treaty, and it just literally blew it right out of the water.
[01:49:27.571 --> 01:49:29.152]  You have to know where they're going!
[01:49:29.332 --> 01:49:30.052]  Robert, stay there.
[01:49:30.072 --> 01:49:30.932]  I'm going to let you finish up.
[01:49:30.952 --> 01:49:33.213]  Then Richard and Will, that'll be it for Dr. Michael Kaufman.
[01:49:33.573 --> 01:49:39.195]  Then we've got the two-time Super Bowl champion, five-time pro bowler, speaking out for 9-11 Truth, scheduled.
[01:49:39.435 --> 01:49:40.055]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:50.464 --> 01:49:51.885]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:51.905 --> 01:49:54.006]  A new world order.
[01:49:54.706 --> 01:49:58.948]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:49:59.588 --> 01:50:01.789]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:50:02.169 --> 01:50:04.690]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[01:50:05.230 --> 01:50:07.671]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:08.412 --> 01:50:15.755]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:18.751 --> 01:50:23.814]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:24.215 --> 01:50:27.597]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:47.470 --> 01:50:48.711]  You have been warned.
[01:50:49.731 --> 01:50:54.953]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:55.093 --> 01:51:03.197]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:03.437 --> 01:51:10.500]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:11.961]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:12.041 --> 01:51:17.946]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:18.126 --> 01:51:23.210]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:23.330 --> 01:51:32.198]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:32.478 --> 01:51:35.760]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:17.160]  Dr. Michael Coffman is our guest.
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:18.761]  Is Robert in California still there?
[01:53:18.781 --> 01:53:20.041]  Some answer.
[01:53:21.221 --> 01:53:24.042]  Yeah, they think they're going to be homo-divine.
[01:53:24.082 --> 01:53:24.402]  That's right.
[01:53:24.422 --> 01:53:27.123]  They think they're going to be the new God-man.
[01:53:27.543 --> 01:53:29.684]  That's the whole push since the Greek philosophers.
[01:53:29.724 --> 01:53:30.444]  Any other comments?
[01:53:31.364 --> 01:53:32.924]  Yeah, and also a couple of news points.
[01:53:33.745 --> 01:53:36.165]  One, I don't know if you already covered this or not.
[01:53:36.605 --> 01:53:42.727]  Also, Pat Robertson has just endorsed Willie Giuliani.
[01:53:44.248 --> 01:53:45.929]  Yeah, pro-abortion.
[01:53:46.029 --> 01:53:49.270]  Oh, by the way, I actually heard the radio ad.
[01:53:49.650 --> 01:53:53.031]  Pastor Hagee says Jesus is not the Savior.
[01:53:53.471 --> 01:53:55.171]  And again, this is a new show.
[01:53:55.532 --> 01:54:00.073]  A major supposed evangelical preacher says Jesus is not the Messiah.
[01:54:01.053 --> 01:54:04.295]  Right, and yeah, I'm just reading that right now.
[01:54:04.395 --> 01:54:06.736]  It happened at 11 o'clock a.m.
[01:54:06.796 --> 01:54:07.116]  today.
[01:54:07.956 --> 01:54:12.899]  Also, a little point on what you've been saying, Alex, about them ratcheting up the war machine.
[01:54:13.339 --> 01:54:14.560]  I've been driving around L.A.
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:18.202]  listening to all the talk show radios on the a.m.
[01:54:18.242 --> 01:54:22.804]  dials around here, and they just keep talking about nuclear strike, nuclear strike, nuclear strike.
[01:54:22.864 --> 01:54:27.046]  So I think we should hold on to our socks, as they say.
[01:54:27.606 --> 01:54:28.126]  I agree.
[01:54:28.406 --> 01:54:36.630]  I mean, to hear Hagee, and this is not a religious show, but this is the guy who's all pro-war, knew Kyran all this, and Dr. Kaufman, the network even has the club.
[01:54:36.650 --> 01:54:37.470]  I'll play it tomorrow.
[01:54:39.031 --> 01:54:41.592]  I mean, can you believe he actually is saying that now?
[01:54:41.612 --> 01:54:43.493]  No, I'm stunned.
[01:54:43.533 --> 01:54:46.895]  I'm stunned that Pat Robertson would support Giuliani, too.
[01:54:46.935 --> 01:54:51.457]  I mean, just, that is so far from what they had been preaching for all their lives.
[01:54:51.517 --> 01:54:53.798]  It's just beyond what I can conceive of.
[01:54:55.238 --> 01:54:56.759]  We're seeing it all happen right now.
[01:54:58.641 --> 01:54:59.302]  We're seeing it all.
[01:54:59.382 --> 01:55:03.505]  Imagine 11,000 members of that guy's church down in San Antonio, and they all just sit there loving it.
[01:55:04.065 --> 01:55:05.687]  I mean, they'll buy anything.
[01:55:05.727 --> 01:55:10.991]  See, once you buy into torture and world government and corruption and police state, you buy into it all.
[01:55:11.651 --> 01:55:13.933]  Richard, Texas, you're on the air with Dr. Michael Kaufman.
[01:55:14.433 --> 01:55:14.874]  Hi, guys.
[01:55:14.934 --> 01:55:18.517]  Another quick news item, and then on to something a little bit more pertinent.
[01:55:19.197 --> 01:55:26.623]  I've read on Rents today that we have grounded all of our F-15s on a worldwide basis, including in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:55:27.882 --> 01:55:36.627]  And secondly, I wanted to reinforce the request that you urgently get Jim Phelps from GOE Watch on to your show.
[01:55:36.987 --> 01:55:40.128]  He takes this information to an even deeper hole.
[01:55:40.489 --> 01:55:44.130]  He's a whistleblower that was involved with Oak Ridge.
[01:55:44.891 --> 01:55:48.973]  For his second generation, his father was in it as well and died from contamination there.
[01:55:49.033 --> 01:55:54.275]  And there's just a monstrous amount of information out there that I think you would really enjoy getting into.
[01:55:54.596 --> 01:55:55.096]  Absolutely.
[01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:57.831]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[01:55:57.871 --> 01:55:58.952]  Dr. Cobham, we're out of time.
[01:55:59.012 --> 01:56:00.274]  Fire out your excellent website.
[01:56:01.355 --> 01:56:03.297]  It's discerningtoday.org.
[01:56:03.837 --> 01:56:06.400]  Discerningtoday.org.
[01:56:07.801 --> 01:56:10.264]  And again, mention that book that's still in print.
[01:56:11.121 --> 01:56:12.002]  Saviors of the Earth?
[01:56:12.562 --> 01:56:21.768]  And what I do is I basically define exactly where the environmental movement came from, and more importantly, what they really believe in, in the leadership of the environmental movement.
[01:56:21.788 --> 01:56:26.672]  Where they're taking us into this occult belief that nature is God and we must worship nature.
[01:56:28.596 --> 01:56:32.318]  All I know is, is that everything's being turned upside down right now.
[01:56:32.338 --> 01:56:32.859]  It is.
[01:56:33.379 --> 01:56:42.665]  And the economy is gyrating downwards into the abyss and the neocons are on radio just jabbering about World War III and everything else.
[01:56:43.145 --> 01:56:48.489]  We are definitely in the middle of massive change and it's only going to accelerate.
[01:56:48.769 --> 01:56:51.711]  Dr. Michael Coffman, thank you so much for spending time with us today.
[01:56:52.451 --> 01:56:53.312]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:56:54.426 --> 01:56:59.642]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we're going to get an amazing individual on the line with us.
[01:57:01.167 --> 01:57:25.978]  After this break, Mark Stepnoski, and many of you know who he is if you're football fans, I remember watching him on television myself back when I still had time to watch television and football games back in the mid-1990s, growing up in Dallas, quite a Cowboys fan, and he has eloquently spoken out for 9-11 Truth, and he's scheduled to join us coming up in the next hour with some other big 9-11 breaking news as well.
[01:57:26.138 --> 01:57:27.339]  Stay with us.
[01:57:30.054 --> 01:57:34.899]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:34.939 --> 01:57:35.340]  Big Brother.
[01:57:47.342 --> 01:57:48.423]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:49.103 --> 01:57:50.244]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:50.865 --> 01:57:51.685]  You want answers?
[01:57:52.446 --> 01:57:53.366]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:54.007 --> 01:57:57.669]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:58.190 --> 01:58:02.313]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:03.253 --> 01:58:07.837]  Last week, George Carlin, legendary, top comedian in the country,
[01:58:09.386 --> 01:58:12.307]  Went public and said he doesn't believe the official story and questions it.
[01:58:12.807 --> 01:58:15.409]  Martin Sheen, of course, last week also went public.
[01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:16.449]  You heard it here first.
[01:58:17.029 --> 01:58:20.751]  Charlie Sheen, his son, last year was the first big star to go public.
[01:58:21.531 --> 01:58:24.792]  Now we've had a bunch of other top Hollywood stars and others go public.
[01:58:25.132 --> 01:58:31.095]  And the point is, is this takes a lot of courage for him to do, and more and more people are starting to stand up and speak out.
[01:58:32.435 --> 01:58:35.957]  We had a story a couple days ago, former NFL star, latest to question,
[01:58:36.850 --> 01:58:43.158]  9-11 official story, ex-Dallas Cowboys lineman Stipnoski tells Indiana newspaper of doubts.
[01:58:50.643 --> 01:58:54.905]  Matthew Stepnoski is a former American football offensive lineman in the NFL.
[01:58:54.925 --> 01:59:00.547]  He attended Cathedral Preparatory School in Erie, Pennsylvania and went on to star at the University of Pittsburgh.
[01:59:00.828 --> 01:59:09.191]  Stepnoski's pro career in the NFL was spent with the Dallas Cowboys from 89 to 94 and then back from 99 to 2000 and the Houston Oilers from 95 to 98.
[01:59:09.891 --> 01:59:17.395]  Stepnoski won two Super Bowls while with the Cowboys, remember watching those, and was a five-time pro bowler attending the game from 92 through 96.
[01:59:18.255 --> 01:59:19.956]  Also notable among his achievements
[01:59:20.616 --> 01:59:26.561]  Are the contributions he made to help Emmett Smith become the all-time rushing champion of the NFL?
[01:59:26.821 --> 01:59:27.682]  Absolutely!
[01:59:28.262 --> 01:59:39.651]  And again, in November 2007, Sapnowski expressed support for the 9-11 Truth Movement, and he is also working with Normal, which I don't smoke marijuana, it makes me paranoid, but I think it should be legalized.
[01:59:39.671 --> 01:59:44.455]  George Washington smoked it, and it has thousands, it's a miracle drug, much bigger than aspirin,
[01:59:45.055 --> 01:59:51.796]  And Mattel's throwing you in jail for that, but you can take Ritalin and Prozac all day, or Hillbilly Heroin, or the Oxycontin.
[01:59:52.217 --> 01:59:55.217]  But, sir, I am so honored to have you on with us.
[01:59:55.817 --> 01:59:56.397]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:59:56.457 --> 01:59:57.858]  It's great to be here with you today.
[01:59:58.438 --> 02:00:03.239]  I want to, just out of the gates, when we come back from break, get into 9-11 truth, and talk to you during the break.
[02:00:03.479 --> 02:00:05.539]  You told me when you woke up to it, the day it happened.
[02:00:05.779 --> 02:00:06.199]  Same here.
[02:00:06.219 --> 02:00:10.440]  And then I want to talk about normal, because the whole war on drugs is obviously very important.
[02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:12.801]  But talk about that day, 9-11.
[02:00:14.315 --> 02:00:21.823]  Yeah, that was a Tuesday, which that was my last year playing football in the NFL, and that was our day off.
[02:00:22.683 --> 02:00:25.246]  So I happened to catch a decent amount of it on TV.
[02:00:25.546 --> 02:00:32.753]  And I just remember at the time thinking to myself, you know, is this really a terrorist attack on us by a foreign nation?
[02:00:32.934 --> 02:00:37.038]  Or is this a false flag operation being conducted by our government?
[02:00:37.602 --> 02:00:38.022]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:00:55.586 --> 02:01:11.957]  A lot of the unofficial story about that event, and I noticed there were a lot of parallels between that event and 9-11 as far as bombs being found in the building, scientists coming out and saying that an ammonium nitrate bomb could never cause that much damage.
[02:01:13.198 --> 02:01:19.384]  I read another book about McVeigh's trial called Others Unknown, which was actually written by the gentleman who represented him.
[02:01:19.664 --> 02:01:26.570]  And he was convinced that there were other people involved in that event that never were brought to justice.
[02:01:27.351 --> 02:01:29.613]  So there were just a lot of similarities between the two.
[02:01:31.505 --> 02:01:44.272]  Yeah, once that event occurred, I was skeptical, and then obviously, you know, once you start following it from the get-go, you're exposed constantly to information to reinforce your belief.
[02:01:44.953 --> 02:01:45.413]  Exactly.
[02:01:45.453 --> 02:01:47.294]  I've tried to disprove my own research.
[02:01:47.934 --> 02:01:53.615]  But take Oklahoma City, or the First World Trade Center, where the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the driver, gave them the detonator.
[02:01:53.695 --> 02:01:59.416]  Now lawyers have gone in, gotten the admissions from Terry Nichols that McVeigh was a government agent.
[02:01:59.696 --> 02:02:00.556]  We already knew that.
[02:02:00.636 --> 02:02:07.478]  Now the Southern Poverty Law Center, it's come out in federal documents, was basically running Elohim City, the white supremacist compound.
[02:02:07.798 --> 02:02:08.858]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:02:09.558 --> 02:02:10.678]  Yeah, there's so much.
[02:02:10.958 --> 02:02:15.339]  Again, the two events, there's so much information behind the scenes.
[02:02:16.502 --> 02:02:23.347]  Well, you're a well-known iconoclast, known for being quite intellectual in your own right, and I'm just very impressed just talking to you in a few minutes here.
[02:02:23.367 --> 02:02:27.331]  I'm very excited about the 55 minutes we've got left with you, sir.
[02:02:27.691 --> 02:02:34.296]  We'll be right back with pro bowler, two-time NFL Super Bowl champion, Mark Stepnoski.
[02:02:34.756 --> 02:02:38.099]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:42.202 --> 02:02:43.583]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:43.603 --> 02:02:45.685]  A new world order.
[02:02:46.431 --> 02:02:51.593]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:02:51.653 --> 02:02:53.473]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:02:54.134 --> 02:02:56.394]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:02:56.935 --> 02:02:59.375]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:00.116 --> 02:03:07.478]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:15.433]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:15.914 --> 02:03:19.396]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:19.776 --> 02:03:22.298]  Bill Burdick is making great progress for the world government.
[02:03:22.338 --> 02:03:23.479]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:23.499 --> 02:03:24.279]  They're not after money.
[02:03:24.299 --> 02:03:25.340]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:26.321]  They're after power.
[02:03:26.561 --> 02:03:27.561]  That's what they're after, you see.

[02:04:41.264 --> 02:04:43.086]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:04:43.246 --> 02:04:48.430]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:04:48.590 --> 02:04:49.931]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:04:50.212 --> 02:04:58.379]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:04:58.599 --> 02:05:04.404]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:05:04.524 --> 02:05:06.265]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:05:06.365 --> 02:05:08.467]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:05:08.627 --> 02:05:12.872]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:05:13.052 --> 02:05:15.235]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:05:15.275 --> 02:05:23.063]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:05:23.524 --> 02:05:23.864]  We're good.
[02:05:42.417 --> 02:05:44.600]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:47.964]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:06.170 --> 02:06:10.613]  As usual, we're having great discussions during the breaks.
[02:06:10.733 --> 02:06:12.174]  Mark Stepnowski.
[02:06:13.135 --> 02:06:14.216]  He is our guest.
[02:06:14.356 --> 02:06:27.468]  He is a five-time pro bowler, two-time Super Bowl champion, and he's the guy that opened up those big holes and recredited most of those big holes driving through so that Emmitt Smith could get that all-time record.
[02:06:28.249 --> 02:06:31.953]  And I asked him what he wanted to talk about, and he said, hey, 9-11 is the big issue.
[02:06:31.973 --> 02:06:33.474]  We'll talk some about the war on drugs.
[02:06:33.814 --> 02:06:34.975]  And absolutely, I agree with him.
[02:06:38.038 --> 02:06:38.679]  We're good to go.
[02:07:07.217 --> 02:07:20.610]  Well, I just think that, you know, growing up reading books about the Kennedy assassination, books like High Treason, you know, there's so many books out there and videos.
[02:07:20.650 --> 02:07:25.975]  The Men Who Killed Kennedy, the five-part series that's played on cable television, was really well done.
[02:07:26.724 --> 02:07:41.689]  But that was just a great introduction over the years of, you know, some of the clandestine activities that occur with the military and with the intelligence services, things that you're never going to see in mainstream media.
[02:07:42.789 --> 02:07:51.692]  And then again, you know, just going along that line throughout that time period, studying the Vietnam War, Watergate, all these things that
[02:07:53.138 --> 02:07:55.319]  Signify a cover-up by the government.
[02:07:56.679 --> 02:08:04.502]  As time goes on, you become more and more aware, as a citizen, that secrecy is the rule of the day with our government.
[02:08:05.742 --> 02:08:16.646]  And any time that anything revelatory comes to light regarding the nefarious activities of our government, it's immediately discredited and hushed up.
[02:08:17.186 --> 02:08:29.359]  So, you know, fortunately we live in an era where alternative media provides true sources of information that can't be sanitized by corporations.
[02:08:29.519 --> 02:08:35.366]  If I can just add, speaking of the Kennedy assassination, now over 90% of Americans in major polls believe the government killed him.
[02:08:35.586 --> 02:08:36.246]  Well, they better.
[02:08:36.266 --> 02:08:37.668]  I mean, E. Howard Hunt now
[02:08:37.708 --> 02:08:40.751]  Now, deathbed confession, only Rolling Stone reports on it.
[02:08:41.052 --> 02:08:53.466]  I mean, we now have the CIA section chief, the guy who was photographed at the scene by the Dallas Morning News, Dallas Times Herald, now admitting that he did indeed run the op to kill him, and it's not on the national news!
[02:08:54.452 --> 02:08:58.194]  Absolutely, and we see things like that all the time.
[02:08:59.134 --> 02:09:10.579]  Recently, this past summer, documents were released proving that the CIA often worked hand-in-hand with organized crime figures to implement their plans.
[02:09:11.199 --> 02:09:19.143]  All these things that at the time would have been considered quote-unquote conspiracy theory are now being substantiated as being true.
[02:09:19.938 --> 02:09:30.585]  So again, fortunately we live in a time where information is a little bit more accessible, so it's becoming harder and harder for a corrupt government to cover up their illegal activities.
[02:09:30.605 --> 02:09:35.468]  You know, in the 60s it took years and years before the Zapruder film was even released.
[02:09:36.030 --> 02:09:36.731]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:09:36.751 --> 02:09:45.278]  I thought the movie The Fog of War with Robert McNamara did a great job of just letting people know what that behind the scenes planning consists of, you know?
[02:09:56.688 --> 02:09:58.689]  And there's so many parallels.
[02:09:58.869 --> 02:10:04.331]  You look at that, the false intelligence leading to war, same thing that's going on now.
[02:10:04.371 --> 02:10:06.052]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:10:06.132 --> 02:10:15.676]  But like you said earlier, if people don't read and they're not familiar with history, it's not as apparent to them that these things happen over and over again throughout time.
[02:10:16.482 --> 02:10:18.924]  Well, history's like having the other team's playbook, isn't it?
[02:10:19.524 --> 02:10:20.205]  Yes, it is.
[02:10:21.305 --> 02:10:32.093]  When you see modern events unfold around you, it's a lot easier to interpret them if you have read their mail, so to speak, ahead of time.
[02:10:33.233 --> 02:10:36.916]  Now, what made you decide to take the plunge for 9-11 Truth?
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:43.905]  Well, it just became a question of not really being able to be quiet about it anymore.
[02:10:43.965 --> 02:10:47.989]  I've talked to my friends about it all the time for the last six years.
[02:10:48.029 --> 02:10:51.352]  You know, I will gladly speak with anybody who wants to talk about it.
[02:10:51.492 --> 02:10:57.377]  Initially, you know, people were very reluctant to even entertain the possibility that it was an inside job.
[02:10:58.171 --> 02:11:10.130]  But again, as the years have gone on, as time has gone on, you know, now we're six, seven years out, enough information is out there to where people are willing to consider it more seriously.
[02:11:10.150 --> 02:11:12.274]  You know, you're probably familiar with
[02:11:13.365 --> 02:11:15.107]  Peter Phillips from Project Censored.
[02:11:15.187 --> 02:11:15.928]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:11:16.809 --> 02:11:17.429]  I love that.
[02:11:17.449 --> 02:11:19.051]  His books, read them every year.
[02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:21.694]  He calls it a threshold concept.
[02:11:22.154 --> 02:11:28.241]  You know, people really need to get to the point where they can assimilate enough information to make that leap.
[02:11:28.741 --> 02:11:33.766]  To go, to think, you know, beyond the parameters that they already possess.
[02:11:33.866 --> 02:11:50.320]  It's like, once we finally believe that we can fly, within a few years of thousands of tinkerers trying it, the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk were able to do it, or Copernicus had enough knowledge to finally convince people the world was round and not flat, or Galileo, that the earth orbited the sun, not the sun the earth.
[02:11:51.138 --> 02:12:06.726]  Yeah, people, when you try to hit them with this all at once, if they're totally uninformed and this information is entirely foreign to them, they're really not willing to entertain it, because it's just too much of a paradigm shift for them.
[02:12:07.227 --> 02:12:13.970]  But for people who gradually are exposed to more and more information, it's less and less of a shock to them.
[02:12:13.990 --> 02:12:17.112]  I think we've reached that point now, because honestly,
[02:12:17.802 --> 02:12:33.247]  When you look at the information that's out there and the credibility of the sources, anybody now who still believes the official story of 9-11 is either incredibly naive or exhibiting complete and total denial.
[02:12:34.798 --> 02:12:42.360]  Well, we know denial is certainly a powerful factor, but did you decide to really speak out and go public?
[02:12:42.401 --> 02:12:48.543]  I mean, I'm just asking because you think things are getting more serious or that they may be planning something else.
[02:12:48.583 --> 02:12:53.224]  I mean, I'm just speculating because more people that I've talked to that are going public now say that's their reason.
[02:12:53.324 --> 02:12:55.445]  I mean, does that play any factor here?
[02:12:56.145 --> 02:12:57.485]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:12:57.806 --> 02:12:58.506]  You know, we have
[02:12:59.818 --> 02:13:04.182]  The desire to start a third war since 9-11 in Iran.
[02:13:05.263 --> 02:13:08.686]  You know, there are stories of missing nuclear warheads floating around.
[02:13:08.706 --> 02:13:12.569]  You know, you read the Kennebunkport warning online.
[02:13:12.949 --> 02:13:17.794]  There are many people worried about Cheney staging another false flag attack.
[02:13:17.834 --> 02:13:23.419]  He's already come out and said the next time it happens, it'll be in the form of a nuclear, a mini-nuke somewhere in a U.S.
[02:13:23.459 --> 02:13:23.719]  city.
[02:13:24.486 --> 02:13:37.293]  And anybody who is familiar with all these military exercises that are constantly going on, they realize that not a lot of people are needed to pull off a false flag attack like that.
[02:13:37.594 --> 02:13:38.794]  Well, what about Colonel Butler?
[02:13:38.814 --> 02:13:45.358]  Defense Language School tells the AP in San Jose Mercury News that they train hijackers in secret spy programs at the base.
[02:13:45.718 --> 02:13:47.139]  Mr. Springman, the head of the U.S.
[02:13:47.199 --> 02:13:54.123]  Embassy, ordered to let hijackers back into the country and was told, don't worry, the terror designation is their cover, they're government agents.
[02:13:54.463 --> 02:13:57.945]  I mean, that right there, and those are only a few of thousands of smoking guns.
[02:13:58.305 --> 02:14:05.488]  Drills of the exact same buildings attacked at the exact same time by aircraft, and then Bush says he never heard of a plan to attack buildings with planes?
[02:14:06.449 --> 02:14:07.770]  Yeah, it's really absurd.
[02:14:07.810 --> 02:14:08.170]  I mean, it's...
[02:14:08.826 --> 02:14:19.633]  When you think back to the time prior to 9-11, all the precautions that were taken at the GA Summit in Italy, you know, these are all scenarios that have been discussed by policy makers.
[02:14:19.733 --> 02:14:21.674]  They know what the threats are.
[02:14:21.974 --> 02:14:25.036]  They know the technology that's out there and what's possible.
[02:14:25.476 --> 02:14:27.117]  Now the general public doesn't know.
[02:14:27.537 --> 02:14:30.139]  So then obviously when they see this scenario envelop,
[02:14:30.909 --> 02:14:35.611]  They don't think of it in terms of a drill or an exercise gone live.
[02:14:35.671 --> 02:14:39.452]  They think of it in terms of, you know, a terrorist attack from an outside entity.
[02:14:39.752 --> 02:14:49.295]  But again, when you listen to the transcripts of the air traffic controllers on the day of 9-11, the first words out of their mouth was, is this live or is this an exercise?
[02:14:49.775 --> 02:14:56.457]  And then they said, I've never seen so much real world going on during an exercise.
[02:14:57.397 --> 02:15:08.427]  Yeah, and I think you read a book like Crossing the Rubicon by Mike Rupert or 9-11 Synthetic Terror Made in the USA by Webster Tarpley.
[02:15:09.468 --> 02:15:23.440]  These guys do a great job of highlighting how many military exercises were taking place on that day and how they served to make the event possible and also to confuse people at the time.
[02:15:24.141 --> 02:15:28.065]  Who are in charge of trying to deter things like that from happening.
[02:15:29.226 --> 02:15:38.537]  But again, I sometimes think that people don't realize how much influence the military has on everyday life in the US.
[02:15:39.864 --> 02:15:49.591]  Well, then there was also Tripod 2 going on, where they did a simulation of terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center complex with the Port Authority.
[02:15:49.891 --> 02:15:56.116]  They'd moved the Emergency Management Center the week before out to the end of the pier, out of the big spook complex, Building 7.
[02:15:56.636 --> 02:16:00.299]  Then the head of FEMA in New York says, yeah, we deployed the night of September 10th.
[02:16:00.839 --> 02:16:02.520]  Then he backed off and said I was wrong.
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:08.523]  Then Giuliani said I was told to get out of the building because Tower 1 and 2 were going to fall, and we were running an exercise.
[02:16:08.563 --> 02:16:12.004]  Then he said he didn't say it, but then we have the video and audio of it.
[02:16:12.204 --> 02:16:13.665]  So it's not, I mean, it's incredible!
[02:16:14.364 --> 02:16:19.647]  Yeah, there are just too many lies for people to go back and, you know, cover them up.
[02:16:19.867 --> 02:16:26.671]  It's such a web of lies that, you know, people like Giuliani have already contradicted themselves repeatedly.
[02:16:27.151 --> 02:16:38.518]  But again, you know, when you think about the similarities to the Oklahoma City bombing, you know, that day the alcohol, tobacco, and firearm agents who were employed in that building didn't show up for work.
[02:16:38.758 --> 02:16:43.040]  And then showed up a minute after in full bomb gear and the police said, why are you here?
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:43.981]  And they said, we got a tip.
[02:16:44.711 --> 02:16:45.291]  Exactly.
[02:16:45.331 --> 02:16:51.093]  The same way that John Ashcroft got a tip not to fly commercially before 11.
[02:16:51.153 --> 02:16:54.074]  The same way Willie Brown got a tip not to fly beforehand.
[02:16:55.174 --> 02:17:00.275]  Yeah, I mean, there are too many instances of foreknowledge to be discounted.
[02:17:01.416 --> 02:17:07.858]  Mark Stepnoski, two-time Super Bowl champion, five-time Pro Bowler, Dallas Cowboys, and of course Houston Oilers.
[02:17:07.878 --> 02:17:08.918]  When we come back,
[02:17:09.719 --> 02:17:12.701]  I want to talk to you about their mindset, how they love to brag.
[02:17:12.761 --> 02:17:16.384]  The PNAC documents, Cheney saying we need a terror attack, a big event.
[02:17:16.964 --> 02:17:18.165]  Brzezinski saying it.
[02:17:18.285 --> 02:17:21.027]  Why do you think they've been so arrogant?
[02:17:21.348 --> 02:17:25.511]  Are they operating on the old 50s, 60s paradigm as Cold War dinosaurs?
[02:17:26.111 --> 02:17:28.132]  And where do you think this is all going?
[02:17:28.212 --> 02:17:36.617]  Because the jig is up with 84% in major polls, not believing the official story, as high as 68% believing inside job.
[02:17:36.917 --> 02:17:39.758]  We'll be back with Mark Stepnowski right after this quick break.
[02:17:39.778 --> 02:17:40.539]  Ted Innes for Midas November 7, 2007.
[02:17:40.599 --> 02:17:43.700]  Gold, 837 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $861.90, $424.70 for half, $212.35 per quarter.

[02:18:06.408 --> 02:18:15.053]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[02:18:15.093 --> 02:18:17.735]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[02:18:18.035 --> 02:18:21.978]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[02:18:22.198 --> 02:18:28.763]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[02:21:47.317 --> 02:21:51.120]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:52.361 --> 02:21:52.881]  That's right.
[02:21:52.981 --> 02:21:55.764]  All we challenge you to do is go check out our information.
[02:21:55.904 --> 02:22:00.127]  You know, Popular Mechanics and Yellow Journalism, Fathers Hearst Publishing.
[02:22:00.427 --> 02:22:03.069]  They go out and build straw men to attack.
[02:22:03.089 --> 02:22:03.930]  They don't fight us.
[02:22:04.270 --> 02:22:09.074]  They go make up things we never said or make up things the kooks said and attributed to us.
[02:22:09.094 --> 02:22:09.835]  No, no, no.
[02:22:09.855 --> 02:22:12.216]  We're talking about real information.
[02:22:13.077 --> 02:22:13.878]  Mark Stepnowski.
[02:22:14.594 --> 02:22:18.538]  Two-time Super Bowl champion is our guest.
[02:22:18.818 --> 02:22:26.946]  The question before the break, Mark, you know, the pre-bragging about how terror attacks are coming, we're going to change the way you live, we need these terror attacks.
[02:22:27.207 --> 02:22:30.150]  I mean, the motives right there, the 44,000 U.S.
[02:22:30.170 --> 02:22:34.634]  troops massed around Afghanistan, the carriers ready to attack in the week before.
[02:22:35.015 --> 02:22:36.196]  I mean, how obvious is that?
[02:22:37.032 --> 02:22:44.917]  Yeah, that's the other thing that, you know, people think that 9-11 just came out of clear blue sky and all of a sudden we had this massive mobilization.
[02:22:45.577 --> 02:22:49.259]  But you can't just stage an invasion on that short of notice.
[02:22:49.399 --> 02:23:00.346]  I mean, anybody who goes back and looks can see all the plans that were laid in place prior to the invasion and that obviously 9-11 gave them the pretext to do it.
[02:23:02.944 --> 02:23:03.904]  Now we go to the mindset.
[02:23:04.064 --> 02:23:09.127]  Why are they so arrogant to stage a giant invasion force with 44,000 U.S.
[02:23:09.167 --> 02:23:11.449]  troops, 18,000 British troops?
[02:23:11.729 --> 02:23:16.932]  Bush had the launch orders to attack Afghanistan, CBS News, Newsweek reported two days before.
[02:23:16.952 --> 02:23:20.534]  I mean, why are they so obvious?
[02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:30.203]  I just think that it's their desperate reaction to the situation regarding peak oil.
[02:23:31.064 --> 02:23:33.625]  I very much believe that peak oil is a reality.
[02:23:34.305 --> 02:23:40.488]  That's a theory that was stressed heavily by Mike Rupert on his From the Wilderness website.
[02:23:42.166 --> 02:23:44.908]  I totally agree with his thinking on that.
[02:23:45.008 --> 02:23:53.395]  I mean, all of the evidence points to rapid depletion of fossil fuels coinciding with greatly increased demand.
[02:23:54.580 --> 02:24:04.968]  So when I see the importance placed on the strength of the dollar, how the only thing that gives our dollar any kind of value is the fact that oil is traded in U.S.
[02:24:05.008 --> 02:24:08.230]  dollars, to me it all ties in together.
[02:24:08.391 --> 02:24:12.454]  It's a need to continue fossil fuel supply to the U.S.
[02:24:12.734 --> 02:24:13.474]  Jimmy Carter
[02:24:14.713 --> 02:24:20.721]  You know, 30 years ago I said that Mideast oil was a national security issue for the United States.
[02:24:20.961 --> 02:24:24.866]  And that, if anything, that whole attitude has grown.
[02:24:25.707 --> 02:24:28.190]  That's first and foremost, you know, our military
[02:24:29.056 --> 02:24:37.404]  It's now used as basically an instrument to secure and protect oil supplies because that is the lifeblood of our economy.
[02:24:37.644 --> 02:24:47.794]  Well, either way, we know it is a national security issue, whether peak oil with them creating artificial scarcity, and it is harder to extract now, or whether it's actually happening.
[02:24:47.834 --> 02:24:50.637]  Regardless, they are creating an energy crisis.
[02:24:50.677 --> 02:24:52.499]  Bottom line, it's here, it's now.
[02:24:53.573 --> 02:25:01.077]  Yeah, and again, you know, it's 60% of the recoverable oil in the world is in the Middle East.
[02:25:01.157 --> 02:25:03.619]  It's in a piece of land roughly the size of Texas.
[02:25:04.699 --> 02:25:16.606]  And I believe that's why Dick Cheney, even though he was subpoenaed several times, he would not release the records from his Energy Task Force in 2001, because that's exactly what was discussed in that meeting.
[02:25:16.666 --> 02:25:23.250]  But O'Neill was there, you're right, Treasury Secretary was there, and four days into their, in the White House, they had maps up about what they were going to carve up.
[02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:24.911]  Absolutely.
[02:25:25.271 --> 02:25:30.496]  And there's a Canadian author, her name is Linda McQuaig, and she wrote a book called It's the Crude Dude.
[02:25:30.656 --> 02:25:34.699]  And she was one of, I believe, the first people in Canada to include that information.
[02:25:34.759 --> 02:25:39.744]  It was finally pried out of the White House after about the fourth or fifth subpoena.
[02:25:40.484 --> 02:25:44.328]  So again, that was another perfect example of secrecy on the part of the White House.
[02:25:45.143 --> 02:25:48.566]  goes hand-in-hand with everything that they have done leading up to this point.
[02:25:49.446 --> 02:25:58.734]  People, I think, have a tendency to forget that this is the same group of guys that was involved in the first Bush administration that were responsible for the Ron Contra.
[02:25:59.394 --> 02:26:01.956]  They had a hand in the savings and loan debacle.
[02:26:02.877 --> 02:26:07.861]  These guys have a long history of illegal activity and then covering it up.
[02:26:08.241 --> 02:26:12.624]  Now that they're getting caught and they're cornered, what do you think they're going to do?
[02:26:15.217 --> 02:26:16.278]  It's hard to say.
[02:26:16.938 --> 02:26:19.360]  It's kind of frightening to think about it.
[02:26:20.962 --> 02:26:35.453]  I don't really know sometimes if it even makes a difference at this point, because now, should a Democrat win the White House in the next election, they have already pretty much acquiesced and said that they will continue the war.
[02:26:35.773 --> 02:26:40.717]  Should Hillary Clinton win, she has already agreed to, I think, stay in Iraq at least until 2013.
[02:26:44.711 --> 02:26:50.856]  From what I understand, most Democrats have signed on for an invasion of Iran.
[02:26:51.696 --> 02:26:54.338]  So, I think a lot of people in the U.S.
[02:26:54.419 --> 02:27:02.705]  have a somewhat false hope about an administration change to a different political party is going to result in new policy.
[02:27:03.545 --> 02:27:05.127]  I'm somewhat doubtful about that.
[02:27:05.747 --> 02:27:06.488]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:27:06.508 --> 02:27:11.311]  When we get back, let's get into more of the serious things that make you question the official story on 9-11, and then talk about
[02:27:14.275 --> 02:27:17.576]  The fact that Congress has an 11% approval rating, so that's the good news.
[02:27:17.596 --> 02:27:27.280]  Now both parties have been exposed, and I think some people aren't awake like you said, but a lot of others are waking up to the fact that the establishment owns all the horses in the race.
[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:28.100]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:32.101 --> 02:27:35.103]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:36.023 --> 02:27:38.744]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:42.046 --> 02:27:44.367]  America is the fattest nation on the planet.
[02:27:44.487 --> 02:27:50.991]  The obesity epidemic kills over 300,000 Americans each and every year, and this number continues to rise at an alarming rate.
[02:27:51.131 --> 02:27:54.252]  With fast food chains everywhere, eating right is not an easy task.
[02:27:54.452 --> 02:27:57.614]  It's time to stop eating those unhealthy meals and fattening snacks.
[02:27:57.874 --> 02:28:00.536]  Assured that you and your family do not become a statistic.
[02:28:00.756 --> 02:28:02.997]  Introducing the Excalibur Dehydrator.
[02:28:03.117 --> 02:28:06.018]  The Excalibur Dehydrator brings healthy eating to a whole new level.

[02:29:41.698 --> 02:29:42.358]  It's a fact.
[02:29:42.578 --> 02:29:50.059]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:29:50.180 --> 02:29:59.041]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:29:59.301 --> 02:30:09.843]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:30:10.123 --> 02:30:16.186]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[02:30:16.406 --> 02:30:21.428]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[02:30:21.608 --> 02:30:26.091]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[02:30:26.251 --> 02:30:28.051]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[02:30:28.071 --> 02:30:28.292]  That's 877-943-8600.
[02:30:28.332 --> 02:30:28.792]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[02:30:28.912 --> 02:30:30.773]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[02:30:37.976 --> 02:30:48.800]  They wailed against the crowd With another red tag band Declaring independence They laid their bodies down
[02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:17.314]  Thanks to the Renegades, we are free today.
[02:31:19.275 --> 02:31:27.101]  And Mark Stepnowski is certainly a Renegade when it comes to taking action, speaking out, and having a lot of courage.
[02:31:28.616 --> 02:31:30.578]  In fact, this is out of the Erie paper.
[02:31:31.558 --> 02:31:33.320]  Q&A with Mark Stapnoski.
[02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:42.687]  Since retiring from football six years ago, Mark Stapnoski has changed countries, buying a house in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he now lives with his long-time girlfriend.
[02:31:43.949 --> 02:31:53.657]  He's also changed lifestyles, trading the hectic demands of playing for the NFL for the relatively laid-back retirement that includes travel, reading, and taking in concerts and performing arts.
[02:31:53.877 --> 02:31:57.560]  But Sipnowski, 40, always a bit of an iconoclast, hasn't changed.
[02:31:57.760 --> 02:32:05.127]  He continues to work towards the legalization of marijuana, an effort that began pursuing in the earnest after leaving football.
[02:32:05.908 --> 02:32:14.757]  And he has now added a new interest, speaking out publicly, it's really an old interest we learn now, 9-11 Truth Movements, whose adherents question the mainstream accounts.
[02:32:14.817 --> 02:32:20.362]  And I read it here, he's also a fan of George Carlin, who said he questions the official story last week.
[02:32:21.203 --> 02:32:24.166]  What do you think of George Carlin now saying he questions the official story?
[02:32:25.166 --> 02:32:26.047]  Well, I think it's great.
[02:32:26.547 --> 02:32:30.791]  I think that, you know, if you had to pick one guy who might do that, he would be the guy.
[02:32:30.951 --> 02:32:35.214]  You know, he kind of has a reputation as being an anti-authority figure.
[02:32:35.495 --> 02:32:39.438]  You know, a guy who kind of, you know, cuts through the chase and gets to the point.
[02:32:40.479 --> 02:32:41.840]  Yeah, I was excited to hear that.
[02:32:44.082 --> 02:32:49.286]  Boy, it'd be interesting if we saw the biggest country star out there go public for 9-11 Truth.
[02:32:51.295 --> 02:32:52.176]  I'm not going to even say it.
[02:32:52.616 --> 02:33:18.759]  There are so many people who know what's going on who haven't yet spoken out or gone public, but I just pray that that happens, because as more people go public, it makes it safer for others to do it, and I really think a mass awakening, a renaissance of awakening, could totally expose false flag terror and really inoculate the public against it to where the New World Order basically can't use that tool anymore.
[02:33:19.816 --> 02:33:29.386]  I agree, and I think one of the things that is helping people come to that conclusion is the amount of information that's out there that is sourced from mainstream media.
[02:33:29.406 --> 02:33:40.358]  Now, you're never going to see discussions like we are having today in mainstream media, but at the same time, a lot of people who are skeptical of the things we are talking about
[02:33:40.902 --> 02:33:55.782]  You know, they always tend to believe that these sources that we are reading on the internet or in books or magazines are subversive, unsubstantiated, but that's why I think people should
[02:33:56.556 --> 02:34:03.443]  Should be open to reading things like the Terror Timeline by Paul Thompson, which is entirely sourced from mainstream accounts.
[02:34:03.523 --> 02:34:10.590]  People can look at how this information is put together even when it is gleaned from major media.
[02:34:10.950 --> 02:34:14.354]  So I think, you know, once people expose themselves to that kind of book
[02:34:15.135 --> 02:34:28.068]  Or, if they read something by David Ray Griffin, which debunks some of the theories being put out by mainstream media, then I think they'll be a little bit more willing to accept some of the things that we are talking about today.
[02:34:28.128 --> 02:34:30.511]  Well, here's an example of debunking poplar mechanics.
[02:34:31.167 --> 02:34:38.550]  We'll show some physicist and say, they just say, oh it's not true, with a guy saying expert under him, some 20 year old kid.
[02:34:39.751 --> 02:34:46.374]  Or they would say, oh NORAD never intercepted any plane before 9-11 but Payne Stewart in 2000, the golfer.
[02:34:47.254 --> 02:34:58.759]  And then we went and got the very same spokesman for NORAD who said that to popular mechanics in AP and Reuters, during the Payne Stewart thing, saying they had 167 of them in just the months before that.
[02:34:59.594 --> 02:35:08.342]  I mean, you know, my dad's a pilot and he's been off course before and, you know, they get on the radio and threaten to send an F-16s up when he's flying around a storm in a Cessna over Central Texas.
[02:35:08.722 --> 02:35:10.604]  So, I mean, it's just they build strongmen.
[02:35:10.644 --> 02:35:11.444]  Can you comment on that?
[02:35:12.585 --> 02:35:21.213]  Yes, I think, you know, once people become familiar with the protocol that exists, it's readily apparent that that protocol was broken on that day.
[02:35:21.653 --> 02:35:26.237]  And that, you know, the events that happened that day, the way they transpired,
[02:35:27.022 --> 02:35:28.446]  That is not commonplace.
[02:35:29.048 --> 02:35:31.515]  And it doesn't matter who's...
[02:35:32.884 --> 02:35:36.286]  Who's in charge as far as giving the order to shoot down planes?
[02:35:36.427 --> 02:35:43.471]  There is a protocol that's been established, and like you said, it's been followed repeatedly in the past.
[02:35:44.052 --> 02:35:58.482]  So, to see such a divergence from the normal way that things are supposed to occur, as far as the response of jets and the response of NORAD, it just goes without saying that it's an anomaly.
[02:35:58.522 --> 02:36:01.304]  You know, things were purposely altered that day.
[02:36:02.853 --> 02:36:26.455]  And then we have all these first responders, medical workers, police, scores of them saying they heard the 22nd countdown when they blew up Building 7, and then BBC, 25 minutes before it falls on two different channels, says we've just gotten word Building 7, Salomon Brothers, has fallen from fire, total collapse, and there it is behind them, out the window, and they gave the exact official story that later came out hours later.
[02:36:26.536 --> 02:36:27.857]  I mean, that's smoking gun!
[02:36:28.613 --> 02:36:38.101]  Yeah, in addition to, I'm sure a lot of your listeners are familiar with Larry Silverstein's comments about the building being pulled as if it was being demolished.
[02:36:38.882 --> 02:36:52.934]  I was fortunate enough a couple months ago to go see William Rodriguez speak live in Vancouver, and I was already familiar with his story, but nonetheless, it was really compelling to go see him in person and listen to it firsthand.
[02:36:53.536 --> 02:37:02.081]  Yeah, like you said, the amount of eyewitnesses who were there that day, they're becoming more and more vocal.
[02:37:02.242 --> 02:37:10.447]  I think that people are starting to realize that they're hearing the alternative belief now about what really happened that day.
[02:37:11.505 --> 02:37:14.607]  The difference is they're not hearing it from corporate media.
[02:37:14.627 --> 02:37:16.288]  They're hearing it from eyewitnesses.
[02:37:16.769 --> 02:37:21.672]  Well, speaking of that, up on PrisonPlanet.com, we have the George Washington Blogspot thing here.
[02:37:21.692 --> 02:37:27.296]  9-11 family member, Patty Cazazza, government new exact date and exact targets.
[02:37:27.316 --> 02:37:37.403]  9-11 family member, Jersey girl, Patty Cazazza, has just revealed that the whistleblower told her that before 9-11, the government knew the exact day, the type of attack, and the targets.
[02:37:37.623 --> 02:37:39.064]  And she had to meet the government whistleblower
[02:37:39.484 --> 02:37:40.145]  I don't think so.
[02:37:58.135 --> 02:38:00.877]  I'll be arrested if I tell you what I know under national security.
[02:38:01.238 --> 02:38:04.500]  All I can tell you is the Bush's vacation with the Bin Laden's.
[02:38:04.801 --> 02:38:12.126]  Here is a Jersey girl, Patty Cazaza, talking about one of the inside whistleblowers giving her this information.
[02:38:13.167 --> 02:38:16.050]  I met other whistleblowers on the side of the road in Maryland.
[02:38:17.304 --> 02:38:19.205]  You know, to hear what they could tell us.
[02:38:19.326 --> 02:38:21.968]  None of them revealed state secrets to us, by the way.
[02:38:24.149 --> 02:38:36.559]  But they had information and basically the government knew, you know, other than the exact moment, they knew the date and the method of which the attacks were supposed to come.
[02:38:37.119 --> 02:38:39.641]  And none of this made it to mainstream media.
[02:38:40.201 --> 02:38:42.203]  None of it made it into the commission.
[02:38:42.864 --> 02:38:55.430]  And yet, again, all of your representatives on the day that the commission book came out were on their pulpits saying, what a fabulous job this commission has done, a real service to this nation.
[02:38:56.050 --> 02:38:58.671]  And it was anything but a service.
[02:38:58.751 --> 02:39:00.672]  It was a complete fabrication.
[02:39:00.992 --> 02:39:02.293]  That's Patty Kozaza.
[02:39:03.133 --> 02:39:11.057]  Going back to Mark Stamnoski, two-time Super Bowl winner, five-time Pro Bowler, Dallas Cowboys, and of course the Texas Oilers, now the Tennessee Titans.
[02:39:13.257 --> 02:39:18.801]  I mean, that is another amazing testimony right there, and as these things mount, they can't ignore it, Mark.
[02:39:19.362 --> 02:39:22.564]  I'll tell you, Alex, I'm so glad that you mentioned the Jersey Girls.
[02:39:22.584 --> 02:39:40.218]  I was hoping we could discuss them briefly, because, you know, when people who believe the official story of 9-11 hear skeptics talk about it, they always accuse us of not being sensitive to the victims' families.
[02:39:41.334 --> 02:39:46.017]  And that also goes for the war in Iraq or Afghanistan.
[02:39:46.157 --> 02:40:02.066]  If you question the official story, if you exhibit any kind of skepticism, they automatically equate that as being disrespectful to the families of the 9-11 victims or of the soldiers who have died in war.
[02:40:02.754 --> 02:40:19.399]  And I totally disagree with that, you know, because as you just have shown, the family members of these victims are some of the most outspoken critics of the official story, and they, as much as anyone, are trying to get to the bottom of what really happened on that day.
[02:40:19.979 --> 02:40:31.382]  So I believe it's the total opposite, that by questioning these things, we are doing everything we can to help these families of victims and slain soldiers find out
[02:40:32.358 --> 02:40:36.081]  The whole reason behind why they had to die in the first place.
[02:40:37.703 --> 02:40:38.563]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:40:38.744 --> 02:40:53.056]  Over a year and a half ago now, I interviewed in a semi-film, Terror Storm, Bill Doyle, the head of 7,000 plus victims and family members, survivors of 9-11, lost his son, Joey, on that morning.
[02:40:53.866 --> 02:40:56.687]  He came on the show and he said, I believe it's a total inside job.
[02:40:56.747 --> 02:40:58.248]  The words were total inside job.
[02:40:58.608 --> 02:41:03.791]  And he said that the majority of the victims' family groups and victims believe it's a total inside job.
[02:41:04.091 --> 02:41:06.972]  But then the media always says all the family members hate us.
[02:41:07.352 --> 02:41:13.975]  But there have been family members for five years who've gone out and encircled the White House saying Bush did it, Bush knew.
[02:41:14.496 --> 02:41:16.596]  And I saw one little CNN report on that.
[02:41:16.917 --> 02:41:21.899]  And so exactly how dare them speak for the victims and family members and those that lost loved ones.
[02:41:22.159 --> 02:41:26.462]  When the majority believe it's an inside job, another hoax by the controlled corporate press.
[02:41:27.263 --> 02:41:28.104]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:41:28.164 --> 02:41:32.787]  And I think it goes hand-in-hand with the whole secrecy theme that we discussed earlier.
[02:41:34.108 --> 02:41:47.018]  Whether it's the 9-11 Commission, whether it's Justice Department emails, whether it's extraordinary rendition by the CIA, it could be domestic spying by the NSA, whatever it is,
[02:41:47.887 --> 02:41:52.211]  This administration's policy has been secrecy and denial.
[02:41:52.872 --> 02:41:59.858]  So again, that's a pattern that's been clearly established, you know, since the administration began in 2000.
[02:42:02.621 --> 02:42:11.970]  So again, I don't understand, you know, people are willing to accept that the administration withheld information and all those other related areas.
[02:42:12.923 --> 02:42:22.327]  Yet, for some reason, it's still tough for some people to apply that same thinking to Line 11 and to believe that the administration was keeping secrets about that also.
[02:42:24.168 --> 02:42:27.910]  I want to shift gears and come at you from left field, because I just thought of this.
[02:42:27.930 --> 02:42:33.853]  About a year and a half ago, we talked to Kevin Tillman, Pat Tillman's brother.
[02:42:35.173 --> 02:42:35.873]  We got his number.
[02:42:36.654 --> 02:42:39.955]  And he said, I don't want to go public right now, but we have a lot of questions.
[02:42:40.015 --> 02:42:41.176]  We think he could have been murdered.
[02:42:41.696 --> 02:42:42.036]  No, I don't.
[02:43:01.552 --> 02:43:01.993]  I don't know.
[02:43:16.485 --> 02:43:32.656]  Three times at close range in the head, a triple burst, from closer than 15 yards, not thousand yards or whatever, that they kept shooting him, that he kept begging to not be shot, it kept saying stop, and that they basically killed him.
[02:43:33.036 --> 02:43:35.858]  Then the Army doctors and investigators said it was murder.
[02:43:36.078 --> 02:43:37.258]  They were told to shut up.
[02:43:37.939 --> 02:43:42.562]  We know that they killed some of the people that spoke out about the Private Lynch thing being staged.
[02:43:42.902 --> 02:43:44.583]  Well, I just think that that whole situation is tragic.
[02:43:44.963 --> 02:43:46.744]  It's extremely disappointing to see
[02:44:01.636 --> 02:44:11.782]  His idealism be subverted and to be basically him to be used as an agent of propaganda.
[02:44:12.802 --> 02:44:19.726]  I didn't know Pat, but I paid attention to his story, you know, simply because he's a former NFL player and it got a lot of attention.
[02:44:20.729 --> 02:44:29.816]  And I don't question his motives or his idealism one bit, and I don't fault him in any way for wanting to do what he thought was right.
[02:44:30.057 --> 02:44:30.597]  Absolutely.
[02:44:30.897 --> 02:44:40.545]  But at the same time, I just think it's tragic that when he did join, he and his brother decided to do what they did, he was championed by the media.
[02:44:40.585 --> 02:44:43.507]  He was looked at as a hero, and rightfully so.
[02:44:44.768 --> 02:44:50.533]  His story was used as a way to propagate the drums for war further.
[02:44:51.633 --> 02:45:01.321]  And then when he wound up unfortunately and tragically getting killed, that was also used as a way to further the agenda for war.
[02:45:02.292 --> 02:45:09.118]  Even though, as you just clearly explained, they didn't tell the truth about the circumstances surrounding his death.
[02:45:09.358 --> 02:45:24.270]  So it was so disheartening to see a guy being used throughout the entire process, used as a guy to sell the war, and then after he was killed, that was used as a way to try and drum up patriots.
[02:45:24.350 --> 02:45:31.416]  And they covered up the fact that he'd written letters and was firmly against the war, saying it was an illegal war and a fraud.
[02:45:32.248 --> 02:45:45.421]  Yeah, and I guess, like you said, you know, he was planning to make some connections with famous anti-war speakers, you know, Noam Chomsky, Cindy Sheehan, those were some names that were thrown around.
[02:45:45.641 --> 02:45:52.328]  And again, you know, the whole reason that we're supposed to be over there fighting is for our freedoms, right?
[02:45:52.368 --> 02:45:54.470]  It's supposedly to protect our freedoms.
[02:45:55.111 --> 02:46:02.003]  Yet here is a guy who obviously had his freedoms suppressed in the most drastic way possible, and that was by killing him.
[02:46:03.265 --> 02:46:04.267]  Shifting gears back into 9-11...
[02:46:05.976 --> 02:46:12.139]  With Mark Stepnoski, Super Bowl Champion, two-time, five-time Pro Bowler, joining us for 9-11 Truth here today.
[02:46:12.179 --> 02:46:15.741]  And again, I want to commend you and thank you and I just admire you more than ever.
[02:46:15.761 --> 02:46:23.065]  I never would have thought watching you in the Super Bowl I'd ever be talking to you, much less about such an incredible issue.
[02:46:23.085 --> 02:46:27.307]  But here we are brought together with the audience and people listening all over the world right now.
[02:46:28.583 --> 02:46:30.645]  What would you like to see happen with 9-11 Truth?
[02:46:30.665 --> 02:46:32.166]  Where would you like to see this go?
[02:46:32.227 --> 02:46:33.908]  Because people call for another investigation.
[02:46:34.048 --> 02:46:38.272]  I'm sure that sounds fine, but it'll just be the same whitewash they already tried to have.
[02:46:38.292 --> 02:46:41.614]  Henry Kissinger is the supposed head of it.
[02:46:42.495 --> 02:46:43.396]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[02:46:44.517 --> 02:46:46.959]  How independent could the commission be?
[02:46:48.140 --> 02:46:49.361]  How much power would it have?
[02:46:49.401 --> 02:46:50.262]  How much time?
[02:46:50.282 --> 02:46:51.603]  You know, how much funding?
[02:46:52.402 --> 02:46:56.168]  Uh, we all know how much Bush and Cheney fought the original 9-11 Commission.
[02:46:56.208 --> 02:46:57.510]  They didn't want to appear.
[02:46:57.590 --> 02:46:59.874]  Then they agreed only to appear together.
[02:46:59.894 --> 02:47:01.596]  They wouldn't speak under oath.
[02:47:02.417 --> 02:47:04.360]  Uh, they fought over who was going to head it.
[02:47:04.641 --> 02:47:07.805]  Uh, they wouldn't, uh, allocate any money towards it.
[02:47:08.886 --> 02:47:12.468]  It was just a complete stonewall all the way down the line.
[02:47:12.528 --> 02:47:17.990]  I think that right there should make people skeptical about what the government is saying about 9-11.
[02:47:18.030 --> 02:47:19.851]  Well then, what's the plan?
[02:47:19.871 --> 02:47:23.072]  I mean, what's your idea, just off the top of your head or from your gut, Mark?
[02:47:23.132 --> 02:47:24.473]  I mean, what do you think we should do?
[02:47:24.513 --> 02:47:26.734]  Just continue to educate the court of public opinion?
[02:47:27.674 --> 02:47:29.075]  Oh, I think that never hurts.
[02:47:29.415 --> 02:47:35.658]  I think that, you know, a vital and functioning democracy depends on an informed voting populace.
[02:47:36.339 --> 02:47:46.436]  You know, we don't have a chance of holding our leaders accountable if we don't educate the public on what is going on and what we can possibly try to do to prevent it.
[02:47:47.776 --> 02:47:56.859]  If you're going to expect constitutional government to react in the way that it's supposed to, then impeachment proceedings would be the way to go.
[02:47:56.879 --> 02:47:59.479]  I am not a Democrat.
[02:47:59.699 --> 02:48:04.201]  However, I am excited that Dennis Kucinich is trying to get something done along those lines.
[02:48:05.281 --> 02:48:07.441]  Where that will lead, who knows?
[02:48:08.102 --> 02:48:09.082]  But at the same time,
[02:48:10.131 --> 02:48:15.614]  Everything during this administration has been geared towards increasing executive power.
[02:48:16.134 --> 02:48:19.535]  At least articles of impeachment would be a step in the other direction.
[02:48:20.436 --> 02:48:22.057]  I agree impeachment is key.
[02:48:22.197 --> 02:48:24.518]  Final segment with Mark Stepnowski.
[02:48:24.918 --> 02:48:35.383]  Full hour with the Super Bowl champion and quite a mind when it comes to understanding false flag terror and the geopolitical system in view of history, present and the future.
[02:48:35.703 --> 02:48:37.784]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:48:42.327 --> 02:48:43.728]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:44.789 --> 02:48:45.851]  A new world order.
[02:48:46.571 --> 02:48:50.575]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a power.
[02:48:50.675 --> 02:48:53.218]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:48:53.498 --> 02:48:56.521]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[02:48:57.061 --> 02:48:59.464]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:00.246 --> 02:49:07.610]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:10.591 --> 02:49:15.534]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[02:49:22.459 --> 02:49:23.600]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:23.620 --> 02:49:24.381]  They're not after money.
[02:49:24.401 --> 02:49:25.482]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:25.702 --> 02:49:26.423]  They're after power.
[02:49:26.683 --> 02:49:27.503]  That's what I produce here.

[02:50:41.397 --> 02:50:45.659]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:50:45.919 --> 02:50:50.801]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:50:51.001 --> 02:50:52.342]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[02:51:38.344 --> 02:51:39.104]  Riders on the storm.
[02:51:39.144 --> 02:51:46.727]  Into this house we're born.
[02:51:46.847 --> 02:51:48.648]  Into this world we're thrown.
[02:52:02.473 --> 02:52:02.994]  We're good to go.
[02:52:19.896 --> 02:52:21.016]  Very important information.
[02:52:21.056 --> 02:52:24.677]  We have the screens going, starting over again at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:25.437 --> 02:52:32.399]  And the AM and FM stations across the country re-airing the broadcast, and of course the network re-airing it from 9 to midnight as well.
[02:52:32.759 --> 02:52:39.280]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement, who the global elite are, how they use terrorism, how they use control, what their master plan is.
[02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:49.302]  It's available at InfoWars.com, the DVD, or watch it in super high quality right now at PrisonPlanet.tv as well as TerrorStorm Special Edition, the final cut.
[02:52:49.902 --> 02:52:59.290]  The history of government-sponsored terror, and I take the approach in the same way I woke up, in the same way that Mark woke up, is going through all the declassified admissions of government-sponsored terror.
[02:52:59.950 --> 02:53:02.332]  So I hope folks will get in game at InfoWars.com.
[02:53:02.853 --> 02:53:06.516]  Mark, in closing, I want to ask you about Ron Paul, but we've got about four minutes left.
[02:53:07.036 --> 02:53:15.383]  Real fast, that's another point we didn't get into, all the admitted declassified examples of where criminals in our government have staged terror before.
[02:53:16.525 --> 02:53:31.476]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, as time goes on, as these documents reach the time where they're allowed to be released, I think it'll become more and more apparent to people, you know, how the intelligence agencies work behind the scenes.
[02:53:32.677 --> 02:53:35.960]  I'm excited about Ron Paul, just because, you know,
[02:53:36.949 --> 02:53:40.010]  He is the only Republican candidate who is against the war.
[02:53:40.410 --> 02:53:46.371]  And I think that attitude coincides greatly with the general feeling of the American public.
[02:53:46.472 --> 02:53:50.012]  And he's also, for drug decriminalization, he's a medical doctor.
[02:53:50.052 --> 02:53:52.213]  He knows that it's a scourge.
[02:53:52.953 --> 02:53:53.513]  Absolutely.
[02:53:53.573 --> 02:53:55.154]  Very much a libertarian belief.
[02:53:55.314 --> 02:53:59.695]  Even though he has to run as a Republican, I mean, he is truly a libertarian.
[02:54:00.308 --> 02:54:04.632]  And that belief goes hand-in-hand with libertarian ideology.
[02:54:04.672 --> 02:54:07.454]  What would you call your political view if you had to put a label on it?
[02:54:08.595 --> 02:54:09.816]  Oh boy, it's hard to say.
[02:54:09.896 --> 02:54:15.621]  I mean, it's easy to look at a bunch of different guys and take bits and pieces from what they believe.
[02:54:16.501 --> 02:54:21.385]  I am generally reluctant to just put a label on myself or anybody.
[02:54:21.485 --> 02:54:22.186]  You want freedom?
[02:54:23.006 --> 02:54:23.827]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:54:24.768 --> 02:54:29.292]  You know, back in 1989 when the wall came down and the Soviet Union
[02:54:30.462 --> 02:54:30.942]  Broke up.
[02:54:31.122 --> 02:54:33.303]  We were supposed to realize a peace dividend.
[02:54:33.663 --> 02:54:36.224]  You know, we had been through a Cold War for generations.
[02:54:36.284 --> 02:54:38.765]  You know, we had had, you know, Korea, Vietnam.
[02:54:39.805 --> 02:54:43.347]  We were supposed to experience a peace dividend, and that hasn't happened.
[02:54:44.027 --> 02:54:46.588]  As a matter of fact, the exact opposite has happened.
[02:54:46.608 --> 02:54:50.349]  You know, we have Donald Rumsfeld talking about the long war.
[02:54:50.369 --> 02:54:52.450]  Hundred-year war is a new Britain, man.
[02:54:52.730 --> 02:54:58.352]  Yeah, Richard Cheney saying that, you know, the war that will not end in our lifetimes.
[02:54:58.914 --> 02:55:10.116]  So this is just, our foreign policy is going the exact opposite direction of what I think everybody expected it to go in back decades ago when the Soviet Union dissipated.
[02:55:10.136 --> 02:55:23.239]  So it's just very disappointing for me to continue to see $450 billion spent every year on the defense budget when so many other things in the United States are crying out for funding.
[02:55:24.764 --> 02:55:30.152]  You're absolutely right, but they use it as the organizing force to scare us into submission.
[02:55:30.172 --> 02:55:35.719]  They use that tribal instinct to manipulate us against these manufactured boogeymen.
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:40.386]  Well, you've made a big splash for 9-11 Truth and Mark Statnosky two-time
[02:55:41.347 --> 02:55:47.753]  NFL Super Bowl champion, five-time pro bowler, with the team I grew up cheering, the Dallas Cowboys.
[02:55:47.793 --> 02:55:55.281]  We salute you for your courage and I look forward to having you back on to talk about normal and drug decriminalization in the near future.
[02:55:55.421 --> 02:56:01.066]  I salute you in the true spirit of America and the great tradition of liberty.
[02:56:01.226 --> 02:56:05.070]  Thank you for your bold stance and your eloquent defense of liberty.
[02:56:05.874 --> 02:56:06.454]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:56:06.534 --> 02:56:08.095]  It was a pleasure talking with you today.
[02:56:08.375 --> 02:56:10.036]  Mark, again, thank you, sir.
[02:56:10.576 --> 02:56:13.698]  Ladies and gentlemen, back tonight on the network 9 to midnight.
