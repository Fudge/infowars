[00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.231]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:07.952]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.672 --> 00:00:09.813]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:11.254]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:12.875]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:17.357]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.758 --> 00:00:21.820]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:35.025]  Welcome, my friends, welcome.
[00:00:35.105 --> 00:00:39.208]  It is the 13th day of February 2007.
[00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.672]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:44.832 --> 00:00:51.836]  Greg Pallas, BBC reporter, also was reported for ABC Nightly News and Nightline Programs, best-selling author.
[00:00:51.876 --> 00:00:52.717]  He's an American.
[00:00:53.217 --> 00:01:01.102]  Greg Pallas to talk about the intensified propaganda push to attack Iran.
[00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:27.245]  What's happening domestically with electronic voting fraud, what the Democrats are doing in Congress going along with the overall agenda, and then Jason Burmess will be joining us coming up in the third hour concerning net neutrality, attacks on the Internet, and open calls to restrict free speech on the Internet, quote, because of 9-11 conspiracy videos.
[00:01:28.177 --> 00:01:32.379]  They cannot let us continue to operate the way we've been operating.
[00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.880]  TerrorStorm out now for about five months.
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.242]  Over seven million views on Google Video between all the different versions that are up there.
[00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:45.564]  And no one even knows now.
[00:01:45.844 --> 00:01:52.026]  I mean, it was well over 40, 50 million three or four months ago with loose changes on Google Video alone.
[00:01:53.526 --> 00:01:55.247]  And it's scaring the establishment.
[00:01:55.287 --> 00:01:57.368]  They don't like losing their monopoly of power.
[00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.730]  By the way, I got an email from the BBC News Producer basically letting me know to get ready.
[00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:14.693]  It's going to be a huge hit piece coming up Sunday on BBC 2 and then it'll air throughout the week on that same BBC channel.
[00:02:15.193 --> 00:02:15.533]  What is it?
[00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:18.794]  9 o'clock Greenwich Mean Time next Sunday.
[00:02:18.814 --> 00:02:22.735]  I guess that's like 2 or 3 o'clock depending on where you live in the U.S.
[00:02:22.755 --> 00:02:25.876]  Some satellite systems do carry BBC 1234.
[00:02:29.568 --> 00:02:31.089]  And I know we've got people in the UK.
[00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:31.949]  I hope you tape it.
[00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.794]  Literally in segments and are uploading it to YouTube while it's on because I want to be able... I know we've got the Watsons in London and Sheffield.
[00:02:40.354 --> 00:02:41.915]  They'll be writing an analysis of it.
[00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:45.277]  And yes, they followed me around for a full week.
[00:02:46.838 --> 00:02:52.801]  And yes, at the end of it, they basically told me that it was a hit piece and it was very funny to them.
[00:02:54.422 --> 00:02:55.383]  Very, very funny.
[00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:02.960]  And I am just cringing, cringing to see what's going to happen.
[00:03:05.903 --> 00:03:18.916]  They did stuff like my wife would be waiting to eat dinner with me and maybe she gets to have dinner with me two or three times a week, I get to have dinner with her on a Sunday night after the KLBJ syndicated show.
[00:03:21.798 --> 00:03:27.923]  Two hours later, he's just saying, one more question, one more question, until I blow up and say, that's it, no more interview.
[00:03:28.504 --> 00:03:34.809]  I would imagine, just in my crystal ball if I had one, that that will be billed that I couldn't handle the questions.
[00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.352]  Because one time I got mad and got up and he said, what, you can't handle the questions?
[00:03:38.392 --> 00:03:40.074]  And I'm like, no, I'm two hours late.
[00:03:40.334 --> 00:03:41.835]  You've been interviewing me every day.
[00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:43.557]  You've been following me around.
[00:03:43.817 --> 00:03:44.578]  I've got to go.
[00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:47.300]  I just know how they operate.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.161]  I've seen it before.
[00:03:49.526 --> 00:03:51.848]  And I'm racing for it.
[00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.431]  But it won't matter.
[00:03:55.312 --> 00:04:04.980]  People know the mainstream media spins and builds straw men and plays games, but it's hard to watch yourself and be on your A-game for an entire week.
[00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:11.807]  I just know the ads are running every hour, I'm told, on BBC.
[00:04:12.771 --> 00:04:36.373]  television and it's my voice in the advertisement saying bottom line 9-11 is an inside job and then the producer of the show the director calls me up a few months ago and I don't know we'll see what the piece is like the Watsons will give me a report after they watch it I'll tell them my comments and they'll write an article within hours of it
[00:04:37.153 --> 00:04:39.375]  And then, of course, we'll break it down into little pieces.
[00:04:40.036 --> 00:04:41.017]  I've already digressed.
[00:04:41.077 --> 00:04:41.557]  Big news!
[00:04:41.597 --> 00:04:45.181]  Giuliani swears he'll come after your guns when he's your Republican president.
[00:04:46.102 --> 00:04:50.326]  And, uh, Neocon Radio will line up for gun control, because that's who they are.
[00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:52.007]  And I'll be a liberal because I'm against it.
[00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.889]  Huge news!
[00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:55.190]  There's just so much of it.
[00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:59.815]  It's just... We're gonna cover it all when we get back.
[00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:00.195]  Stay with me.
[00:05:04.335 --> 00:05:09.797]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.158 --> 00:05:17.801]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.504 --> 00:05:25.565]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:37.367]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:41.628]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.648 --> 00:05:43.568]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.908 --> 00:05:47.749]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.098 --> 00:06:01.878]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.018 --> 00:06:02.779]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:08.940]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.801]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:11.041 --> 00:06:13.502]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.902 --> 00:06:28.466]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.506 --> 00:06:28.806]  government.
[00:06:28.986 --> 00:06:30.807]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:31.167 --> 00:06:37.091]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:41.734]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:06.874]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:07.114 --> 00:07:08.875]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:09.135 --> 00:07:15.419]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.844]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:22.084 --> 00:07:23.865]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[00:07:23.865 --> 00:07:24.125]  We're good.
[00:07:38.882 --> 00:07:42.486]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[00:07:42.686 --> 00:07:45.209]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:46.431]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:47.732]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:07:47.892 --> 00:07:50.675]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[00:07:50.695 --> 00:07:51.136]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[00:07:51.156 --> 00:07:51.216]  1-866-885-6625.
[00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:05.995]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.356 --> 00:08:08.639]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:20.813]  Rudolph Giuliani says New York gun control needs to go nationwide.
[00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:23.314]  This out of the Associated Press.
[00:08:24.195 --> 00:08:26.996]  It will be hailed as conservative as I've been predicting.
[00:08:27.356 --> 00:08:30.758]  You will now be a liberal if you're not for total massive gun control.
[00:08:32.158 --> 00:08:37.701]  Also, about three months ago I was driving down the road listening to Genesis Communications
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:45.805]  Over a local affiliate, 100.1, and I almost ran off the road as he read an AAP article in its entirety.
[00:08:46.366 --> 00:08:50.329]  I ran into the office, typed it in, and sure enough it was true.
[00:08:50.349 --> 00:08:58.835]  And the headline reported that hundreds of lenders, as I've been parroting every day since then,
[00:09:00.618 --> 00:09:10.462]  We're not even asking for ID for bank accounts and then housing loans, car loans from illegal aliens, but citizens have to show three forms of ID.
[00:09:10.843 --> 00:09:15.284]  We've now got a national ID card going into place right now, the Real ID Act.
[00:09:16.685 --> 00:09:21.207]  Well, there's a lot of new news on this very same subject and even more today.
[00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:24.629]  Credit card aimed at illegal immigrants.
[00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:27.550]  That is the AP headline.
[00:09:28.547 --> 00:09:30.788]  Similar headline from Reuters.
[00:09:31.909 --> 00:09:37.333]  And then I have another story here out of Los Angeles Times.
[00:09:37.533 --> 00:09:42.115]  Bank of America casts wider net for Hispanics.
[00:09:42.796 --> 00:09:45.818]  But then it goes on to say it's really illegal aliens.
[00:09:46.338 --> 00:09:49.200]  So we'll report on these new developments for you.
[00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:56.152]  Iraq says that it has closed its borders with Syria and Iran.
[00:09:56.652 --> 00:10:00.853]  If that isn't a prelude to a strike on Iran, I don't know what is.
[00:10:01.933 --> 00:10:20.457]  Now, evidence just three days after the false report by the Pentagon that they confirmed that plastic explosives were being transferred inside mortar shells to the Iraqi insurgency, the Shia insurgency, now being completely debunked
[00:10:21.593 --> 00:10:22.794]  And so we'll break that down.
[00:10:23.354 --> 00:10:31.217]  But before I cover that news, we do have Greg Palast in the second hour, Jason Bermas in the third, on a lot of important news and issues.
[00:10:32.918 --> 00:10:38.240]  This is out of the Marine Corps Warfighting School.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.342]  It is the official handbook, number 06-17, released in May of 2006.
[00:10:51.838 --> 00:11:08.388]  And it's got a marine sergeant on the cover twisting someone's arm behind their back with his knee into the center of their back in a police maneuver.
[00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:20.516]  And the caller called in about a month ago, a marine in Virginia, and he said that he had this handbook, and he said that it talked about the American citizens,
[00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:26.553]  Talked about mainstream property rights activists being terrorists.
[00:11:26.893 --> 00:11:29.338]  It's basically a regurgitation.
[00:11:30.191 --> 00:11:35.314]  of ADL propaganda that's been adopted in SLAT training for the federal marshals.
[00:11:35.434 --> 00:11:47.440]  We have the state handbook from Virginia, state handbook from Texas, state handbooks from Nevada, FBI, one-sheet flyers printed, small print front and back.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.442]  I put it in my film Road to Tyranny in 2002.
[00:11:51.482 --> 00:11:58.426]  My new film Terror Storm spends about two minutes on this and shows four or five different manuals.
[00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:00.079]  But this one's different.
[00:12:00.099 --> 00:12:01.440]  This isn't state police.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.521]  This isn't domestic law enforcement.
[00:12:04.561 --> 00:12:07.321]  This is the United States Marine Corps.
[00:12:08.582 --> 00:12:10.182]  And I came into the office this morning.
[00:12:12.683 --> 00:12:13.903]  And sure enough, there it was.
[00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.003]  And we've thumbed through it.
[00:12:15.043 --> 00:12:16.864]  And sure enough, the claims he made are there.
[00:12:16.904 --> 00:12:19.745]  So by tomorrow, we'll have scans of this up.
[00:12:20.785 --> 00:12:22.686]  It is a 75-page booklet.
[00:12:24.898 --> 00:12:30.320]  And Aaron Dykes is going to read it in detail and then highlight it and scan much of it.
[00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:38.104]  And I just did a scan of it and it's not good.
[00:12:38.744 --> 00:12:40.165]  We'll just put it to you that way.
[00:12:41.505 --> 00:12:47.488]  It's basically the same thing we get out of the state manuals written by the Feds and the ADL, but it's the Marine Corps.
[00:12:48.428 --> 00:12:49.689]  This is high treason.
[00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:51.970]  This handbook is
[00:12:54.184 --> 00:12:57.446]  It is terrorist by every real benchmark.
[00:12:58.487 --> 00:13:04.971]  It is treason by every benchmark, by every yardstick.
[00:13:08.373 --> 00:13:11.175]  I have been to the urban warfare drills all over the country.
[00:13:11.215 --> 00:13:23.102]  We have footage from Northern California to Hebron, Maryland to Swansboro, North Carolina to Florida to Brooksville, Florida where our military trains in many cases with foreign troops
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:24.941]  With role players.
[00:13:25.041 --> 00:13:27.142]  Hired actors, no expenses spared.
[00:13:27.162 --> 00:13:28.582]  They're paid 15-20 bucks an hour.
[00:13:29.223 --> 00:13:36.266]  Local actors, local thespians, disgorge the theaters and they go down by the hundreds.
[00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:40.348]  And they scream, I'm an American, please no not the camp.
[00:13:40.388 --> 00:13:42.609]  And they do mock interrogations and they say, where are you from?
[00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:43.590]  I'm from San Francisco.
[00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:44.690]  Where'd you get the helmet?
[00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:45.530]  Where'd you get the weapons?
[00:13:46.051 --> 00:13:48.552]  And they're practicing fighting American insurgency.
[00:13:50.917 --> 00:13:58.860]  And it's now been in the Army Times late last year that yes they will use foreign troops in the battle against the American people.
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:04.663]  I mean pure foreign troops.
[00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:09.365]  Entire foreign contingents from foreign armies.
[00:14:09.845 --> 00:14:16.708]  Not to mention the fact that a large portion and growing of our military are now foreign born illegal aliens.
[00:14:18.584 --> 00:14:22.166]  So, just a prelude to this that we did get it in.
[00:14:22.226 --> 00:14:24.268]  It does indeed say what he said it said.
[00:14:24.288 --> 00:14:26.969]  I didn't doubt him when he was reading it.
[00:14:27.049 --> 00:14:29.251]  I'd heard the exact language scores of times.
[00:14:31.552 --> 00:14:35.374]  Again, our problem here is we have so much evidence we can't even go over all of it.
[00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:41.538]  Every few months I get some new law enforcement manual, some new law enforcement DVD, some new law enforcement
[00:14:42.834 --> 00:14:48.175]  You know, file on a disk, some Acrobat file, PDF.
[00:14:48.836 --> 00:14:50.776]  And we go look at it, it just says the same thing.
[00:14:52.136 --> 00:15:01.299]  And before we moved to this office about a year ago, I literally in the corner of the office had a small box filled with files and videos and documents.
[00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:07.020]  And really we should, I guess, get interns in here who scan all this and upload it.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.821]  But at a certain point, it's kind of like
[00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:19.281]  Again, the cops pull over somebody and they've got photos in the front seat of women they've kidnapped and murdered and killed.
[00:15:20.302 --> 00:15:22.683]  And so the police get the person's driver's license.
[00:15:22.983 --> 00:15:24.084]  It's probable cause.
[00:15:25.805 --> 00:15:27.706]  They don't even have to wait to go to the house.
[00:15:27.766 --> 00:15:28.747]  You don't need a warrant then.
[00:15:30.048 --> 00:15:31.689]  Clear and present danger.
[00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:33.750]  And they go directly to the house.
[00:15:34.711 --> 00:15:44.955]  And they smell the stench right away and they pull up the floorboards in the basement and there are 15 dead bodies and they find four or five in the backyard.
[00:15:45.295 --> 00:15:46.675]  I mean, how many times has that happened?
[00:15:46.695 --> 00:15:47.335]  Hundreds of times.
[00:15:50.857 --> 00:15:58.039]  And so it's kind of like once you pull up the floorboards and there's the stench and you see a bunch of half-rotten bodies and a couple skeletons
[00:15:59.252 --> 00:16:00.913]  We've already dug up a whole bunch of them.
[00:16:00.933 --> 00:16:07.118]  We know they're totally guilty and then basically it's like finding a hundred more bodies buried on the back forty.
[00:16:07.838 --> 00:16:10.500]  I don't even have time to dig them up or put them in bags.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:11.781]  I don't have the staff.
[00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:12.782]  I don't have the people.
[00:16:15.384 --> 00:16:22.749]  And that's why I have somewhere around here, I've got two storage buildings now, a box of this stuff.
[00:16:22.809 --> 00:16:24.991]  Well, this is not going to go in the box.
[00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:28.253]  This is going to go up with the small percentage we have put up.
[00:16:29.204 --> 00:16:34.146]  That has been even reported on by the Washington Times and a few other mainstream publications.
[00:16:35.647 --> 00:16:51.413]  World Net Daily's reported on it, some gun groups, Gunners of America's reported on it, but you would get training manuals out of Arizona or out of Nevada in 1999 put out by the Clinton Justice Department and the FBI, with the FBI's phone numbers on it you could call.
[00:16:53.254 --> 00:16:58.236]  In Arizona they put out over 50,000 of these, not just to the police but to the citizens.
[00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:00.542]  They think this is normal.
[00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:04.763]  And it said gun rights groups, people that make frequent references to the U.S.
[00:17:04.803 --> 00:17:05.543]  Constitution.
[00:17:05.903 --> 00:17:07.344]  It said you're a domestic terrorist.
[00:17:07.404 --> 00:17:16.145]  And now we have the one out of Texas that's even worse that says property rights activist and then that's a newer one from two years ago.
[00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:17.846]  There's another from last year out of Virginia.
[00:17:17.866 --> 00:17:18.866]  It says the exact same thing.
[00:17:19.146 --> 00:17:26.448]  So it's written by the same individuals and it's just put in all the different manuals to give them a local look, I guess.
[00:17:27.808 --> 00:17:28.748]  But this is different.
[00:17:30.186 --> 00:17:31.567]  Because this is the U.S.
[00:17:31.607 --> 00:17:32.268]  Marine Corps.
[00:17:33.089 --> 00:17:35.851]  This is the United States Marine Corps.
[00:17:37.352 --> 00:17:38.433]  And it's the military.
[00:17:39.334 --> 00:17:42.256]  And they can try to claim that the Marines are under posse comitatus.
[00:17:42.296 --> 00:17:43.337]  That's more boulder dash.
[00:17:44.358 --> 00:17:49.142]  And it's just unbelievable.
[00:17:49.743 --> 00:17:55.968]  They have images here of people being rounded up and loaded onto armored vehicles with tags on their backs.
[00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:03.231]  With what their name is and what part of the insurgency they think they're part of.
[00:18:04.112 --> 00:18:05.752]  And it's a manual for Iraq.
[00:18:05.812 --> 00:18:07.432]  It's a manual for Macedonia.
[00:18:07.852 --> 00:18:09.793]  It's a manual for Austin, Texas.
[00:18:10.513 --> 00:18:11.733]  Or Oakland, California.
[00:18:13.294 --> 00:18:14.134]  Or Simi Valley.
[00:18:16.714 --> 00:18:17.354]  It is treason.
[00:18:17.374 --> 00:18:20.955]  It says, AJ, hope this helps you.
[00:18:20.995 --> 00:18:21.835]  Brother James.
[00:18:22.396 --> 00:18:24.456]  And it says, for official use only.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:54.405]  and uh... they go on to say that not supposed to be showing this to anybody well let me tell you something terrorist we're going to show people who the real terrorist are don't you worry this is no longer our military people running our government are bought and paid border by foreign interest period and this goes on to say that uh... this is a handbook used by the army and the marine corps i should uh... add that
[00:18:57.515 --> 00:19:01.358]  So basically, it's predominantly mainly Army material in here.
[00:19:01.378 --> 00:19:08.144]  It says, How the Army conducts detainee operations from the initial capture to internment directly affects the strategy success of U.S.
[00:19:08.164 --> 00:19:09.325]  and coalition forces.
[00:19:10.527 --> 00:19:16.592]  And it just goes into there and it talks about soldiers and leaders in handling and processing detainees.
[00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:23.318]  Instruction includes soldier actions, the point of capture, search techniques, documentation,
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.542]  The transportation and transfer to a military police operated facility.
[00:19:28.562 --> 00:19:36.986]  And it says that much of this is taken directly from the Army's Military Police School Doctrine Development Division.
[00:19:37.006 --> 00:19:39.647]  So that's basically what the Marines have picked up.
[00:19:40.967 --> 00:19:41.368]  Okay.
[00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:46.090]  We'll come back and tell you about Giuliani who wants your guns.
[00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.451]  And I'm a liberal because I'm against it.
[00:19:49.992 --> 00:19:50.552]  I understand.
[00:19:51.687 --> 00:19:56.208]  I understand what neocon listeners are, and I know there's some of you out there listening, and I know I'm bad.
[00:19:57.309 --> 00:19:58.009]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.391]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:05.951]  are located?
[00:20:06.151 --> 00:20:09.532]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:20:09.752 --> 00:20:14.453]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:20:14.754 --> 00:20:19.755]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:20:20.055 --> 00:20:20.395]  I think so.
[00:20:39.428 --> 00:20:41.769]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:08.217 --> 00:21:13.040]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:13.261 --> 00:21:16.003]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:16.043 --> 00:21:17.143]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:18.504 --> 00:21:23.087]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:24.028 --> 00:21:31.293]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:32.294 --> 00:21:35.336]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:37.486 --> 00:21:40.929]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[00:22:01.699 --> 00:22:04.141]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.922 --> 00:22:10.546]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[00:22:10.586 --> 00:22:11.347]  Supreme Court.
[00:22:12.107 --> 00:22:15.490]  Yet on February 29, 2002, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S.
[00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:19.153]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[00:22:20.114 --> 00:22:25.338]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[00:22:26.167 --> 00:22:34.451]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:03.947 --> 00:23:12.851]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:13.311 --> 00:23:20.494]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:21.224 --> 00:23:26.726]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:51.291]  All our times have come

[00:24:23.298 --> 00:24:28.000]  We're good to go.
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.181]  We're good to go.
[00:24:50.075 --> 00:24:51.296]  And worldwide!
[00:24:52.496 --> 00:24:53.917]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:24:54.137 --> 00:24:55.678]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:09.706]  Rudolph Giuliani, this is out of the Associated Press today, says gun control helped reduce New York crime, and he's elected president, he believes in more gun control.
[00:25:09.746 --> 00:25:10.906]  Now let's be clear about that.
[00:25:12.247 --> 00:25:17.510]  It is true that up until the time that Rudolph Giuliani became mayor, well over a decade ago,
[00:25:18.374 --> 00:25:22.157]  That New York had the number one crime rate in the country.
[00:25:23.478 --> 00:25:26.961]  New York is still in the top three every single year.
[00:25:27.241 --> 00:25:33.827]  Detroit, sometimes it's, believe it or not, even Dallas, people like to get pretty violent up there, that's where I grew up.
[00:25:35.308 --> 00:25:41.493]  Los Angeles, they're always in the top four or five, but New York always in the top three.
[00:25:41.933 --> 00:25:45.196]  And it was always, sometimes it's Chicago in the top five.
[00:25:48.522 --> 00:25:51.165]  Giuliani got in and he did start massive arrests.
[00:25:51.185 --> 00:25:52.967]  He did roughly double the number of cops.
[00:25:53.547 --> 00:25:54.729]  He did erase the graffiti.
[00:25:54.769 --> 00:25:56.931]  They did cut back on welfare, which was a magnet.
[00:25:59.894 --> 00:26:06.401]  And they did take their anti-gun, total gun ban policy and extend that
[00:26:07.256 --> 00:26:20.166]  To start randomly searching people all over the place, and it did cause a slight reduction, but to say that New York is some bastion of liberty and bastion of safety is a cruel joke.
[00:26:22.968 --> 00:26:23.988]  Oh, I forgot D.C.
[00:26:24.709 --> 00:26:30.173]  It sometimes is number one in the last few years, taking the crown, but Detroit
[00:26:30.865 --> 00:26:49.031]  D.C., Chicago, L.A., Dallas, they're always, and it depends on how you look at the statistics, overall crime, Chicago, New York, L.A., but out and out killing, sometimes Texas cities, Houston and Dallas have been in the top couple before.
[00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:52.972]  I remember back in the late 80s, Dallas was number one once, I remember that.
[00:26:53.552 --> 00:26:55.133]  I mean, it was just unbelievable.
[00:26:55.173 --> 00:26:59.394]  We're talking like six, seven murders a day, but that was the crack cocaine wars.
[00:27:00.126 --> 00:27:02.528]  That was limited to certain areas of South Dallas.
[00:27:04.829 --> 00:27:10.173]  When the CIA was bringing that stuff in and turning people basically into zombies, you had to have more.
[00:27:11.033 --> 00:27:19.999]  Also, a lot of those numbers were people getting blown away trying to break and enter to steal your stereo, your television set, your computer.
[00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:25.062]  But we have so many Republicans for gun control.
[00:27:25.083 --> 00:27:28.625]  We have the Governor of New York, Pataki, who wants total gun bans.
[00:27:29.508 --> 00:27:30.368]  We have Giuliani.
[00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:42.154]  It's well known in New York City that if you don't pay the police chief or the sheriff who decides you can have a gun, on average over $25,000 in campaign contributions, you don't get one.
[00:27:42.455 --> 00:27:46.997]  And only well-to-do mobsters and others or private security details.
[00:27:47.377 --> 00:27:55.101]  It's come out that Rosie O'Donnell, of course, has up to three bodyguards at any one time who got permits to carry Uzis
[00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.733]  I guess they thought that'd be a good gun, an Uzi.
[00:27:59.753 --> 00:28:04.878]  It'd be a horrible gun in a compact city environment to defend somebody with.
[00:28:06.019 --> 00:28:06.980]  That's just my opinion.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:12.065]  And you've got Giuliani, of course, with all these bodyguards, and Bloomberg, and Pataki.
[00:28:15.068 --> 00:28:19.652]  Of course, it came out that Sarah Brady has bodyguards, and actually
[00:28:20.931 --> 00:28:27.658]  Fended someone off at her San Francisco home with a gun with a permit that is extremely hard to get in San Francisco as well.
[00:28:30.652 --> 00:28:34.895]  And it says, Rudy Giuliani addressed a potentially troublesome issue with conservative voters.
[00:28:35.396 --> 00:28:36.256]  Oh no, they don't care.
[00:28:36.296 --> 00:28:38.558]  As long as she'll nuke Iran, they'll turn their guns in.
[00:28:39.179 --> 00:28:42.722]  As long as America is destroyed, mainline conservatives are happy.
[00:28:43.082 --> 00:28:53.271]  As long as the North American Union happens, as long as the borders are open, as long as they can put plastic flags on their cars and can't find Iraq on a map but just say, kill them all, it's at primitive level.
[00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:58.355]  They'll do whatever they're told, they'll buy whatever lies they're given, and I'm not joking when I say that.
[00:28:59.275 --> 00:28:59.996]  They're just scum.
[00:29:00.016 --> 00:29:03.598]  I'm talking about that 22% that supports the war.
[00:29:04.098 --> 00:29:05.880]  Now, all the liberals I know are out buying guns.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:13.464]  You see, they've seen real conservatism, real constitutionalism with this broadcast, and they now understand.
[00:29:13.844 --> 00:29:17.747]  In the past, they would see phony conservatives up there, and they said, I want nothing to do with conservatism.
[00:29:18.107 --> 00:29:18.647]  No, no, no, no.
[00:29:18.687 --> 00:29:19.668]  Those were frauds.
[00:29:20.208 --> 00:29:22.510]  So, see, now the liberals understand why they need guns.
[00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.111]  Well, you hear them call in all the time.
[00:29:24.631 --> 00:29:25.812]  I meet them on the street, talk to them.
[00:29:26.532 --> 00:29:27.493]  We'll finish up with this.
[00:29:29.754 --> 00:29:37.615]  And then we'll get into NFL refused to run an ad to recruit Border Patrol agents and credit cards aimed at illegal immigrants.
[00:29:39.496 --> 00:29:40.876]  Without an ID, you just get one.
[00:29:41.856 --> 00:29:44.497]  Alright, we'll be right back on the other side.
[00:29:44.577 --> 00:29:46.877]  Take your calls, get into Iran News with Greg Palast.
[00:29:47.157 --> 00:29:49.498]  Then we'll talk about the attack on free speech and the web.
[00:29:50.698 --> 00:29:51.598]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.078 --> 00:29:53.698]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.598 --> 00:29:57.279]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.952 --> 00:30:04.515]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.

[00:31:00.618 --> 00:31:05.564]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[00:31:05.885 --> 00:31:07.767]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:31:07.967 --> 00:31:11.011]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:31:11.191 --> 00:31:14.335]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:31:14.636 --> 00:31:16.478]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[00:31:16.738 --> 00:31:20.443]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:31:20.724 --> 00:31:23.388]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:31:24.008 --> 00:31:28.314]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:31:28.515 --> 00:31:32.761]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:31:33.181 --> 00:31:37.524]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[00:31:37.825 --> 00:31:42.088]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.

[00:32:00.615 --> 00:32:01.716]  How are you feeling today?
[00:32:01.996 --> 00:32:09.041]  I ask because if you have health challenges, then reading our free booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:13.624]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call mangosteen.
[00:32:13.904 --> 00:32:20.048]  It's a centuries-old medicinal fruit whose time has come and it has amassed 40 years of published research.
[00:32:20.268 --> 00:32:25.191]  We have information and testimonials from all over the world about the health potential of this amazing fruit.
[00:32:25.512 --> 00:32:30.135]  This powerful botanical has contributed to the well-being of millions of people the world over
[00:32:30.555 --> 00:32:30.995]  Absolutely!
[00:33:00.661 --> 00:33:00.942]  Yeah.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.802]  I think so.
[00:34:13.274 --> 00:34:14.795]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:17.157 --> 00:34:19.078]  Glad that you joined us today.
[00:34:19.098 --> 00:34:27.124]  We're going to get to Nathaniel, Vincent, Roger, Roman, and many others coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:34:28.826 --> 00:34:29.786]  Listen to this spin.
[00:34:29.846 --> 00:34:38.893]  It's like George Bush saying he's pro-Second Amendment, but then lobbying and fighting behind the scenes and publicly saying he would have signed the assault weapons ban reauthorization.
[00:34:40.703 --> 00:34:43.665]  that has sent literally tens of thousands of innocent gun owners to prison.
[00:34:44.806 --> 00:34:56.534]  Rudy Giuliani addressed a potentially troublesome issue with conservative voters, saying his policies as mayor to get handguns off the street to help reduce crime in New York, in his crime-ridden city to this day.
[00:34:57.335 --> 00:35:02.619]  I use gun control as mayor, he said at a news conference Sunday during a swing through California.
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.782]  But I understand the Second Amendment, I understand the right to bear arms.
[00:35:07.972 --> 00:35:09.173]  Exact same thing Bush did.
[00:35:09.433 --> 00:35:11.155]  I'm for the Second Amendment, just hand them in.
[00:35:12.216 --> 00:35:15.458]  He said what he did as mayor would have no effect on hunting.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.764]  Zero guns that you could buy at a store.
[00:35:23.065 --> 00:35:31.712]  You had to go buy them out of state and then you had to get a special permit through the police chief or the sheriff and folks that were literally just a couple hundred of those issued.
[00:35:33.301 --> 00:35:37.447]  Massive news reports about just the fraud and payoffs involved with that.
[00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:45.158]  Or you've got to hire these privately licensed security guards that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
[00:35:47.722 --> 00:35:49.044]  Oh yeah, they're highly paid.
[00:35:49.921 --> 00:35:53.224]  I've talked to some of these bodyguards that guard the stars and other politicians.
[00:35:53.244 --> 00:35:54.685]  They're making $100,000, $120,000 a year.
[00:35:54.785 --> 00:35:59.008]  In fact, they can go to Baghdad right now as private mercs and make $180,000.
[00:35:59.749 --> 00:36:03.452]  They've got former military and former police officer slash detective.
[00:36:03.632 --> 00:36:04.052]  Oh, maybe $200,000.
[00:36:06.294 --> 00:36:07.034]  But not us!
[00:36:07.094 --> 00:36:08.155]  We can't defend ourselves.
[00:36:08.215 --> 00:36:12.979]  And by the way, it's even started in New York where retired cops are having trouble having guns.
[00:36:15.141 --> 00:36:17.983]  He said what he did as mayor would have no effect on hunting,
[00:36:19.446 --> 00:36:30.696]  And addressing another potential trouble spot with conservatives, Giuliani spoke in favor of the border fence, saying, you have to have secure borders, you have to have a fence, and the fence, I think, has to be a highly technological one.
[00:36:30.756 --> 00:36:36.982]  That means homeland security, a few cameras, a few sensors that don't work, and he's just following what Chertoff has said.
[00:36:38.678 --> 00:36:53.845]  Remember, there were going to be 6,000 troops, and then it turned out that no more than 200 at any one time were ever deployed, and most of those were always in a support capacity at a nearby National Guard armory, in many cases, hundreds of miles away from the border.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:06.686]  And the few that were in little guard stations doing what the Minutemen do, looking over the border, get overrun by Mexican troops firing at them, and our military isn't allowed to have bullets, so they run in fear.
[00:37:07.167 --> 00:37:14.931]  But don't worry, they're training to take our guns, and they did it in New Orleans, and their own training manuals say that they're being trained to take our guns.
[00:37:16.712 --> 00:37:17.712]  But that's okay!
[00:37:18.373 --> 00:37:22.715]  Take the American people's guns, just let those Mexican troops shoot at you.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.642]  He said what he did as mayor had no effect on hunting.
[00:37:28.842 --> 00:37:30.163]  Hunting in Manhattan.
[00:37:31.844 --> 00:37:33.426]  Hunting in New York City.
[00:37:35.887 --> 00:37:39.290]  And I have no doubt in a few months he'll be running for President of Israel.
[00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:40.611]  I'll be in a gun store again.
[00:37:40.811 --> 00:37:41.831]  Somebody will saddle up.
[00:37:42.232 --> 00:37:44.493]  Either a customer or somebody that works there.
[00:37:44.753 --> 00:37:44.994]  Hey!
[00:37:45.634 --> 00:37:47.155]  Heard you say he's against guns.
[00:37:47.195 --> 00:37:48.856]  He said he's for the Second Amendment.
[00:37:51.318 --> 00:37:52.219]  I've had it with Bush.
[00:37:52.259 --> 00:37:52.439]  Hey!
[00:37:53.542 --> 00:37:55.784]  I heard you say Bush is for the assault of his band.
[00:37:55.804 --> 00:37:56.364]  That's a lie!
[00:37:57.385 --> 00:38:00.147]  Then the manager goes, no Ralph, it's true.
[00:38:00.167 --> 00:38:01.788]  Hi Mr. Jones.
[00:38:01.969 --> 00:38:03.049]  Leave Mr. Jones alone.
[00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:09.775]  And there's a couple little red-faced twits behind the counter going... Because see, I'm not stupid like you.
[00:38:09.795 --> 00:38:13.798]  I actually defend the Second Amendment 110%.
[00:38:14.318 --> 00:38:15.799]  I actually know what their tricks are.
[00:38:19.262 --> 00:38:20.223]  It's not hard to do.
[00:38:23.428 --> 00:38:26.089]  So, we've got that there for you.
[00:38:28.289 --> 00:38:30.990]  Newt Gingrich is saying attack the First Amendment along with Hillary.
[00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:36.551]  NFL refuses to run an ad to recruit border agents.
[00:38:39.232 --> 00:38:43.433]  The National Football League refused to include a print ad recruiting U.S.
[00:38:43.473 --> 00:38:44.373]  Border Patrol agents.
[00:38:45.789 --> 00:38:52.793]  in the 2007 Super Bowl program because they were quote, uncomfortable with the sensitive nature of the spot according to a league spokesman.
[00:38:53.313 --> 00:38:58.736]  You can't even have ads to advertise that, hey, we need water patrol agents.
[00:39:00.276 --> 00:39:05.959]  Oh no, that's... Well, I thought the NFL's tough stuff, pro-America!
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.221]  That thing is filled with globalist propaganda.
[00:39:10.902 --> 00:39:11.802]  Again, the Fortune 500... Well, I have
[00:39:14.591 --> 00:39:16.132]  The LA Times here in front of me.
[00:39:17.093 --> 00:39:19.035]  I have Reuters and AP here in front of me.
[00:39:19.495 --> 00:39:28.283]  And this is a lengthy... This is another lengthy story here.
[00:39:29.244 --> 00:39:32.526]  Bank of America cashed wide net for Hispanics.
[00:39:32.567 --> 00:39:33.888]  Very deceptive headline.
[00:39:35.449 --> 00:39:36.250]  It's a puff piece.
[00:39:37.867 --> 00:39:44.633]  Hispanic Americans are the ones that have to show three forms of ID, like white, black, Asian Americans.
[00:39:45.654 --> 00:39:54.062]  It's the illegal aliens, or as you call them, the undocumented migrants, who don't have to show any ID.
[00:39:54.402 --> 00:40:00.368]  And the reason this is important is it shows how the War on Terror is an abject, complete fraud.
[00:40:00.408 --> 00:40:01.469]  They have the Border Patrol,
[00:40:02.908 --> 00:40:05.671]  Sit on the border every 10 miles on average.
[00:40:05.711 --> 00:40:09.674]  We've had border patrol agents, current ones on, sheriffs on, retired ones on.
[00:40:09.694 --> 00:40:11.175]  This has been happening for five years.
[00:40:13.657 --> 00:40:17.401]  Under Ashcroft and now Chertoff and Gonzales.
[00:40:18.502 --> 00:40:20.543]  And they're allowed to look one direction.
[00:40:20.724 --> 00:40:22.485]  North, south, east or west.
[00:40:22.505 --> 00:40:23.866]  Their total which direction to look.
[00:40:24.187 --> 00:40:25.608]  And if they see illegals
[00:40:26.485 --> 00:40:34.011]  On any other of the three areas of the compass, or anywhere between, they are not allowed to pursue or even radio.
[00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:37.274]  Now if you don't believe me, just Google it, it's mainstream news.
[00:40:41.817 --> 00:40:52.226]  And I'm covering that just to illustrate to you what a joke it is when you're driving down an Indiana highway, or a Kansas highway, or a Vermont highway,
[00:40:53.203 --> 00:41:00.346]  We see these in the press every week and there are 20 cop cars in a paddy wagon and they got flashlights in your eyes at 8 p.m.
[00:41:00.626 --> 00:41:03.287]  You're there with the family and they say, hello, license, legislation.
[00:41:03.947 --> 00:41:05.167]  You're lucky if they say please.
[00:41:05.207 --> 00:41:05.887]  You give it to them.
[00:41:05.908 --> 00:41:07.708]  They say, where you going tonight?
[00:41:09.869 --> 00:41:10.989]  Where you going this evening?
[00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.771]  Most Americans, again, they're federally funded.
[00:41:14.791 --> 00:41:16.371]  The cops don't even know why they're doing this.
[00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:18.512]  It's to condition you, it's to train you.
[00:41:19.856 --> 00:41:24.918]  And you go, well, I'm going to see my mother, or we're going to a basketball game, or we're going to a PT, we're going to church.
[00:41:26.799 --> 00:41:29.820]  And, uh, well, uh, you got anything in the car?
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.721]  And there's other cops looking all around in the car.
[00:41:32.001 --> 00:41:33.982]  Are those kids in their safety harnesses all right?
[00:41:34.002 --> 00:41:35.283]  I need to do an inspection of that.
[00:41:35.303 --> 00:41:37.884]  Uh, let me just go ahead and get you out.
[00:41:37.944 --> 00:41:40.125]  Let me, let me, let me run warrants.
[00:41:42.746 --> 00:41:46.107]  And they're up ahead arresting some other guy, you know, had an open beer or whatever.
[00:41:46.127 --> 00:41:47.548]  You know, they've got their excuses for it.
[00:41:48.781 --> 00:41:50.682]  All under federal grants, every time you see it.
[00:41:52.383 --> 00:42:12.292]  And we've got video where people now, one fellow, what was it, in Missouri a few months ago, it was on YouTube, tens of thousands watched it by the time I found it, and posted it on PrisonPlanet.com, and it was a young man, I believe he was 18 years old, very well spoken, and he went to work every night, and he'd been stopped at these checkpoints multiple times.
[00:42:12.932 --> 00:42:13.913]  He says that on the tape.
[00:42:15.296 --> 00:42:16.917]  And so he's got a video camera rolling.
[00:42:16.957 --> 00:42:19.058]  Sure enough, it's a checkpoint like Nazi Germany.
[00:42:19.979 --> 00:42:21.019]  And he pulls into it.
[00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:23.180]  I think we even played audio of that.
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:24.341]  I know I gave it to you, John.
[00:42:24.361 --> 00:42:25.562]  Did we ever end up having time to play that?
[00:42:27.023 --> 00:42:27.723]  We never played it.
[00:42:28.203 --> 00:42:29.364]  It's in the computer, isn't it?
[00:42:29.384 --> 00:42:30.685]  It's like 20 minutes long.
[00:42:30.705 --> 00:42:33.606]  I don't think we can play the whole thing, but see if you can grab it.
[00:42:33.626 --> 00:42:36.188]  See if you can find it right when the cop first tells him, get out of the car.
[00:42:37.828 --> 00:42:39.409]  We'll just play a few minutes of it if you can find it.
[00:42:39.429 --> 00:42:40.850]  I know that was a few months ago I gave it to you.
[00:42:41.711 --> 00:42:44.032]  I send him stuff and half the time we don't have time to play it.
[00:42:46.058 --> 00:42:54.105]  But, um, he very politely just says... Officer takes his license, information, says, where you going?
[00:42:54.125 --> 00:42:57.748]  And he says, I don't really want to talk about my personal life with you.
[00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:00.090]  Alright, get out of the car!
[00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:03.673]  I mean, let me ask you something, cop.
[00:43:03.833 --> 00:43:07.276]  Would you like being pulled over like that and having somebody do that to you?
[00:43:09.438 --> 00:43:09.538]  Hmm?
[00:43:11.727 --> 00:43:12.607]  We're tired of it!
[00:43:12.647 --> 00:43:14.308]  This is the United States!
[00:43:14.668 --> 00:43:19.009]  And don't give me your baloney about it's to stop crime and stop drunks and all the rest of it.
[00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:26.931]  If you want to do that, just go sit outside the bars and look at who stumbles out and pull them over right then.
[00:43:27.791 --> 00:43:29.272]  And actually, Austin does do that.
[00:43:29.932 --> 00:43:32.173]  And it has to be commended, but it's only a few cops.
[00:43:32.213 --> 00:43:33.013]  I see the same guy.
[00:43:33.273 --> 00:43:34.433]  I'll be driving home from work.
[00:43:35.313 --> 00:43:37.454]  I try to not go on that South Lamar Road.
[00:43:38.303 --> 00:43:38.664]  I don't know.
[00:43:51.388 --> 00:43:58.511]  Shooting ducks in a barrel, with like 50 bars right there and they all come out up South Lamar or up 6th Street towards Mopac.
[00:43:58.832 --> 00:43:59.752]  Alright, I'm digressing.
[00:43:59.792 --> 00:44:09.617]  The point is, you pull up, and I've done this, to a huge federally funded checkpoint, and they want you to answer questions, they want you to tell them where you're going, and you don't have to do that.
[00:44:09.697 --> 00:44:10.477]  You shouldn't have to.
[00:44:12.139 --> 00:44:24.422]  Now later he tells the police he's been videotaping it, and they act like vampires who had a bottle of holy water thrown on them, or had a cross shoved up their nose, and they literally just say, get out of here, okay, fine.
[00:44:24.442 --> 00:44:30.584]  Oh, and one of the superiors has tried to claim that, well, you had to say something rude to him, you had to have done something.
[00:44:31.404 --> 00:44:33.524]  He's like, nope, I've got a tape, would you like to come watch it?
[00:44:34.084 --> 00:44:35.645]  Oh, no, no, no, I don't want to come watch it.
[00:44:39.106 --> 00:44:40.346]  And I've already digressed here.
[00:44:43.206 --> 00:44:47.208]  The point is, illegal aliens don't have to show any ID for anything.
[00:44:47.408 --> 00:44:54.431]  They're given preferential treatment on housing, preferential treatment on tuition, on scholarships, on everything.
[00:44:54.511 --> 00:44:55.951]  And it's been announced, it's admitted.
[00:44:56.011 --> 00:44:56.972]  It's all an incentive.
[00:44:58.713 --> 00:45:02.074]  And here is Reuters today, credit card aimed at illegal immigrants.
[00:45:02.794 --> 00:45:05.835]  Now, Kevin Smith told you about this a couple months ago in studio.
[00:45:05.856 --> 00:45:06.896]  He went into Bank of America.
[00:45:07.708 --> 00:45:10.850]  And if you're not an illegal alien, the whole bank is set up for them.
[00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:12.831]  You basically have to wait.
[00:45:13.632 --> 00:45:15.153]  All the lines are in Spanish.
[00:45:15.173 --> 00:45:16.634]  There's one little table if you're not.
[00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:18.475]  This is in downtown Austin.
[00:45:19.556 --> 00:45:21.397]  And there is no English.
[00:45:21.477 --> 00:45:22.377]  It's just Spanish.
[00:45:24.819 --> 00:45:26.580]  In fact, I said we'd go down there with a video camera.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.721]  Maybe we should do that today.
[00:45:28.473 --> 00:45:30.114]  Credit card aimed at illegal immigrants.
[00:45:30.854 --> 00:45:32.575]  And this is the Bank of America Kevin went into.
[00:45:33.095 --> 00:45:39.097]  Bank of America Corporation has begun offering credit cards to customers without social security numbers, typically illegal immigrants.
[00:45:39.437 --> 00:45:41.478]  The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.
[00:45:43.038 --> 00:45:47.860]  I actually had a Bank of America employee call into my Sunday syndicated show and I brought this up and he said, oh yeah, it's true.
[00:45:48.921 --> 00:45:55.503]  They've been told if it's a clear Latin American migrant, just don't ask for anything.
[00:45:57.369 --> 00:46:00.210]  Talk about discrimination, because it's a corporate thing.
[00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.731]  Hey, we're not putting your Border Patrol ad in the Super Bowl program.
[00:46:04.252 --> 00:46:08.293]  Hey, it's racist to want to control our borders.
[00:46:09.253 --> 00:46:11.514]  Because this is the agenda to bring in the North American Union.
[00:46:11.874 --> 00:46:15.415]  They had the North American Union Summit in September last year in Canada.
[00:46:15.455 --> 00:46:20.577]  The first agenda was that it would be secret, but we got the minutes through a foyer, through Judicial Watch.
[00:46:21.638 --> 00:46:25.579]  And the whole thing is about getting corporations by stealth to implement this.
[00:46:26.775 --> 00:46:28.056]  They're doing a darn good job!
[00:46:30.317 --> 00:46:33.260]  While everybody's wanting to go nuke Iran, this is all happening.
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:42.306]  In recent years, banks across the country have begun offering checking accounts and even mortgages to the nation's fastest growing ranks of undocumented immigrants, even illegal aliens.
[00:46:43.006 --> 00:46:48.230]  Most of whom are Hispanic, the paper said, adding these immigrants generally have not been able to get major credit cards.
[00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:51.432]  So, they just admitted bank accounts, mortgages, no ID.
[00:46:53.033 --> 00:46:55.435]  The AP article last year said no ID, period.
[00:46:56.354 --> 00:47:01.277]  The new Bank of America card is open to people who lack both a social security number and a credit history.
[00:47:01.537 --> 00:47:01.957]  That's it.
[00:47:02.098 --> 00:47:03.658]  I'm going in with a hidden camera.
[00:47:05.219 --> 00:47:08.041]  And I'm going... I mean, talk about a lawsuit.
[00:47:08.441 --> 00:47:09.102]  And you watch.
[00:47:10.002 --> 00:47:14.765]  With my dirty blonde hair and my blue eyes, I'm getting nothing.
[00:47:15.065 --> 00:47:16.146]  They're gonna laugh at me.
[00:47:16.606 --> 00:47:18.407]  And there'll be illegal aliens right next to me.
[00:47:19.108 --> 00:47:20.869]  So, getting whatever they want.
[00:47:22.003 --> 00:47:27.925]  These cops want to pull us over and search our cars because of 9-11.
[00:47:27.985 --> 00:47:29.426]  Just shut up!
[00:47:31.007 --> 00:47:33.588]  I mean, I don't know what you're smoking out there, you idiots.
[00:47:33.608 --> 00:47:36.629]  Alright, I'm in a bad mood, I'm sorry.
[00:47:36.669 --> 00:47:46.413]  The new Bank of America card is open to people who lack both social security number and credit history as long as they have held a bank account with the bank for three months without an overdraft, the journal said.
[00:47:46.613 --> 00:47:49.014]  But they give them a bank account without an ID!
[00:47:52.216 --> 00:47:55.657]  Bank of America tested the program last year at five branches in Los Angeles.
[00:47:55.737 --> 00:47:56.317]  Baloney!
[00:47:57.097 --> 00:47:57.697]  Baloney!
[00:47:57.937 --> 00:48:01.058]  I've been in the Bank of America and seen it, and Kevin's been in a separate one.
[00:48:01.918 --> 00:48:14.140]  Bank of America tested the program last year at five branches in Los Angeles, and last week extended it to 51 branches in Los Angeles County, home to the largest concentration of illegal immigrants in the U.S., the Journal said.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:18.480]  The bank hopes to roll the program out nationally later this year, the paper said.
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.561]  A Bank of America spokesman was not immediately available to comment.
[00:48:23.795 --> 00:48:26.416]  And it doesn't threaten them to even sue them, it might illustrate it.
[00:48:26.456 --> 00:48:27.136]  They don't care.
[00:48:27.216 --> 00:48:28.657]  They just print the money out of nothing.
[00:48:28.997 --> 00:48:34.779]  It's the folks that own the Bank of America, the families that are involved with it, are fellow reserve shareholders.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.021]  So, again, it's all just an end to destroy this country.
[00:48:41.322 --> 00:48:48.284]  Anybody who has a bank account with Bank of America, including myself, I still have one, from back when it was another bank of mine they bought.
[00:48:48.304 --> 00:48:51.226]  You know, they buy the bank you've got and then their name's on it.
[00:48:51.246 --> 00:48:52.106]  They're doing it everywhere.
[00:48:53.926 --> 00:48:57.107]  My wife moved an account to another bank and then they bought that.
[00:48:57.688 --> 00:48:59.008]  And they bought my mortgage.
[00:48:59.788 --> 00:49:17.455]  And then tried to cheat me and took the escrow money from the last house I had, this was about seven years ago, and took the escrow money, like $3,000, and then said I was in default and I had to actually have a lawyer start the lawsuit to make them remove it.
[00:49:19.236 --> 00:49:20.197]  That's good business.
[00:49:20.277 --> 00:49:20.997]  Steal money.
[00:49:21.801 --> 00:49:23.102]  Then give somebody bad credit.
[00:49:23.122 --> 00:49:27.044]  You send them letters, the files, the documents to their banking mortgage division.
[00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:28.084]  They just say, we don't care.
[00:49:28.825 --> 00:49:30.145]  Pay us three grand or that.
[00:49:30.706 --> 00:49:33.387]  So I guess they wanted six thousand of my money.
[00:49:34.608 --> 00:49:35.988]  Not if I was a god.
[00:49:36.949 --> 00:49:40.010]  First class citizens in America are cops and illegal aliens.
[00:49:41.491 --> 00:49:42.872]  Everybody else is scum.
[00:49:43.512 --> 00:49:44.733]  Everybody else is trash.
[00:49:45.373 --> 00:49:46.754]  And I've done an analysis of it.
[00:49:47.894 --> 00:49:48.935]  That's how it stands.
[00:49:54.827 --> 00:49:55.928]  Then it goes on and on.
[00:49:58.391 --> 00:50:04.157]  And of course, Vicente Fox, three years ago, you can go to Google Video and just type in Alex Jones confronts Vicente Fox.
[00:50:04.858 --> 00:50:12.587]  He came to town, we finally got it up there for free for you, and I hope you get it out to people, and he came to town to give the police chief an award.
[00:50:14.452 --> 00:50:18.434]  Or his Deputy Police Chief over at the Immigrant Affairs for not following the law.
[00:50:18.554 --> 00:50:23.617]  Openly gave him an award for not stopping or arresting illegal aliens without insurance, IDs.
[00:50:23.857 --> 00:50:25.799]  The police have been told, you leave him alone.
[00:50:26.099 --> 00:50:27.700]  Same thing with Bank of America, all of it.
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:27.940]  See?
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:33.563]  Gave an award in public and gave the legislature an award and gave
[00:50:34.679 --> 00:50:44.468]  Wells Fargo, who was the first to do this three years ago, they've already been doing it, where they issue them a debit card, and then that's used for housing loans, welfare, everything else.
[00:50:45.729 --> 00:50:47.450]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:50:48.331 --> 00:50:49.392]  It's so sick!
[00:50:50.052 --> 00:50:57.419]  But he tried to go out there with Perry and give a speech, and they had to stop the speech 30 seconds in, because I shut them down with the First Amendment!
[00:51:03.752 --> 00:51:09.218]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:09.579 --> 00:51:17.227]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:17.924 --> 00:51:24.967]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.367 --> 00:51:36.792]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.112 --> 00:51:40.674]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.074 --> 00:51:42.995]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.335 --> 00:51:47.177]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:58.656 --> 00:54:08.057]  All right, I'm going to hold Pallas off for a few minutes so we can get to all your calls.
[00:54:08.077 --> 00:54:10.818]  I'm going to get to at least the first people that called in, Nathaniel, Vincent,
[00:54:11.949 --> 00:54:13.131]  Roger, Norman, and others.
[00:54:14.512 --> 00:54:17.316]  But, uh... I promise to play this.
[00:54:17.336 --> 00:54:18.337]  Here's just about a minute of it.
[00:54:18.357 --> 00:54:19.599]  It's like 20-something minutes of it.
[00:54:19.639 --> 00:54:20.680]  It's not the best audio.
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:22.723]  A video camera in the young man's car.
[00:54:22.983 --> 00:54:23.744]  He's at a checkpoint.
[00:54:23.764 --> 00:54:25.366]  There's all these police people getting searched.
[00:54:25.945 --> 00:54:27.025]  They ask where he's going tonight.
[00:54:27.045 --> 00:54:29.486]  He says, I don't want to talk about my personal business with you.
[00:54:29.807 --> 00:54:31.727]  And he says, alright, get up there to the front then.
[00:54:31.747 --> 00:54:33.928]  The guy's probably right back from Baghdad.
[00:54:34.348 --> 00:54:36.229]  Probably thinking, heh, this was Baghdad.
[00:54:36.269 --> 00:54:37.770]  Boy, he'd be going to the torture center.
[00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.550]  Here it is.
[00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:39.810]  How are you tonight, sir?
[00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:39.910]  Fine.
[00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:41.631]  Can you put your window down for me?
[00:54:41.751 --> 00:54:44.312]  Do you have a driver's license or proof of insurance?
[00:54:44.372 --> 00:54:46.053]  What are you hitting tonight?
[00:54:46.513 --> 00:54:49.554]  I wish to discuss my personal life with you, officer.
[00:54:49.854 --> 00:54:51.295]  Alright, come on up here.
[00:54:56.218 --> 00:54:56.638]  Okay.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.221]  Now again, his window's up about an inch.
[00:55:00.261 --> 00:55:01.762]  You hear him go, meh.
[00:55:01.782 --> 00:55:02.763]  Get that down for me there.
[00:55:02.843 --> 00:55:03.883]  Alright, thank you.
[00:55:05.625 --> 00:55:07.726]  That's America, but none of us are illegal aliens.
[00:55:07.746 --> 00:55:16.072]  There have been a bunch of sheriffs on record in Tennessee, you name it, where they arrest illegals and ICE will not come pick them up.
[00:55:16.132 --> 00:55:18.073]  It's like, no, we don't pick illegals up.
[00:55:19.634 --> 00:55:20.295]  They're God.
[00:55:21.397 --> 00:55:24.339]  Because it is designed to bring the country down.
[00:55:24.419 --> 00:55:30.182]  It is an integral part with the corporations, the police, the government working to do this.
[00:55:30.242 --> 00:55:32.283]  This is their way to destroy the U.S., period.
[00:55:33.103 --> 00:55:35.905]  Let's go to Nathaniel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
[00:55:35.945 --> 00:55:36.305]  Welcome.
[00:55:36.705 --> 00:55:37.265]  Hi, Alex.
[00:55:37.566 --> 00:55:39.887]  Hello.
[00:55:39.947 --> 00:55:42.508]  My heart is beating fast just getting an opportunity to talk to you.
[00:55:42.908 --> 00:55:43.649]  Oh, please.
[00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:44.269]  Serious.
[00:55:44.569 --> 00:55:47.811]  I was listening to a show here in Milwaukee this morning, a radio show.
[00:55:47.931 --> 00:55:49.732]  I can't remember the guy's name, Jay Weber.
[00:55:50.416 --> 00:55:53.597]  And right away, I hear this misinformation you constantly talk about.
[00:55:53.617 --> 00:55:55.518]  We hear about 1984 all the time.
[00:55:56.118 --> 00:55:59.679]  And this guy throws out, a majority of Americans support Bush.
[00:56:00.439 --> 00:56:02.880]  A majority of Americans are for the war.
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:05.161]  This is what he's saying on his radio show.
[00:56:05.221 --> 00:56:10.163]  There are hundreds of scientific polls that show between 75 and 82 percent are against the war.
[00:56:10.783 --> 00:56:13.164]  Congress has a 14 percent approval rating.
[00:56:13.564 --> 00:56:14.844]  Cheney has a 12 percent.
[00:56:15.144 --> 00:56:15.524]  Bush has a 29.
[00:56:15.564 --> 00:56:16.225]  It's total baloney.
[00:56:18.618 --> 00:56:21.020]  It's obviously connected to the Obama comments that were made.
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:23.701]  So I got on the show and I said, you're lying.
[00:56:24.102 --> 00:56:24.882]  That's not true.
[00:56:25.042 --> 00:56:26.303]  The polls don't show that.
[00:56:27.143 --> 00:56:28.324]  And he goes, wrong.
[00:56:28.544 --> 00:56:29.084]  I'm a liar.
[00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:34.267]  We're in, and this is exact words, we're in Iraq as a response to 9-11.
[00:56:35.268 --> 00:56:37.049]  And I said, well, that's not what the president says.
[00:56:37.089 --> 00:56:39.330]  The president even said Iraq had nothing to do with 9-11.
[00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:40.591]  And he says, wrong.
[00:56:41.508 --> 00:56:42.569]  And this is the crazy part.
[00:56:42.609 --> 00:56:47.091]  So after I get hung up on it, I made my comments about, you know, his father wouldn't go into Baghdad.
[00:56:47.131 --> 00:56:52.595]  His father, obviously, his advisors told him, hey, don't go into Baghdad.
[00:56:52.615 --> 00:56:53.575]  You're going to start a civil war.
[00:56:53.755 --> 00:56:53.995]  Sure.
[00:56:54.116 --> 00:56:55.336]  Ten years later, this guy goes in.
[00:56:56.577 --> 00:57:00.920]  So the thing that blew me away were the callers after I hung up.
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:04.842]  I'm a limp, like the previous caller, Nathaniel.
[00:57:04.882 --> 00:57:05.502]  He's an idiot.
[00:57:05.522 --> 00:57:08.324]  That's a limp-wristed left winger.
[00:57:09.113 --> 00:57:10.614]  He doesn't care about his country.
[00:57:10.954 --> 00:57:12.875]  It's people like that that hate our country.
[00:57:13.475 --> 00:57:15.276]  And this gets drummed on and on and on.
[00:57:15.316 --> 00:57:17.097]  And what goes into my head is 1984.
[00:57:17.958 --> 00:57:18.418]  Right away.
[00:57:18.938 --> 00:57:24.781]  That literally these outer party members, they don't have any sense of history.
[00:57:24.821 --> 00:57:30.064]  That literally this guy on the radio is rewriting history at that exact moment.
[00:57:30.164 --> 00:57:35.287]  Ignoring one minute before he spoke, and these listeners go along with it.
[00:57:36.229 --> 00:57:36.969]  How do you combat that?
[00:57:36.989 --> 00:57:41.930]  And that's why they're going to lose all their dollar value, it's why they've lost their jobs, it's why they're going to be slaves.
[00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:56.573]  But they still are blaming, they're still stuck in the left-wingers think this, and we think this, and I believe a majority of these people, and this isn't to be racist, are white, and probably do work 40 to 50 hours a week, and maybe don't have time to inform themselves.
[00:57:57.053 --> 00:57:58.253]  Well, no, I mean, that's it.
[00:57:58.293 --> 00:58:04.894]  A lot of white people think they're members of the elite because they're white, and they're part of the power structure, and they couldn't be more wrong.
[00:58:05.865 --> 00:58:09.892]  And another thing, you've got Palace coming on, discussing Iran.
[00:58:09.912 --> 00:58:12.616]  The war drums are clearly beating.
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:16.303]  And now the threat of Iranian weapons of mass destruction are now changing.
[00:58:16.363 --> 00:58:17.564]  What's the threat, I think they said.
[00:58:17.764 --> 00:58:20.466]  Oh yeah, the Financial Times comes out with this headline.
[00:58:20.486 --> 00:58:21.527]  I've got it here in the stack.
[00:58:21.967 --> 00:58:23.368]  Nothing can stop their nukes.
[00:58:23.989 --> 00:58:27.292]  And then you read and it goes, they might be able to in three years now.
[00:58:28.052 --> 00:58:29.594]  Oh, this proves we need war.
[00:58:29.994 --> 00:58:32.196]  And oh my gosh, the deadly mortar shells.
[00:58:32.256 --> 00:58:34.858]  Turns out, by the way, those mortar shells are British.
[00:58:35.218 --> 00:58:35.418]  Ha!
[00:58:35.639 --> 00:58:38.381]  Just like the mobile weapons trucks were British.

[00:58:56.518 --> 00:58:57.159]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.839 --> 00:58:58.899]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.599 --> 00:59:00.719]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.359 --> 00:59:02.180]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:03.840]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:08.421]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.681 --> 00:59:12.802]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.222 --> 00:59:18.103]  Now into hour number two, Greg Palish joining us.
[00:59:18.743 --> 00:59:23.164]  Target Iran to look at what's happening also domestically and with the Libby trial.
[00:59:24.554 --> 00:59:25.515]  Alex, I just want to say I'm a big fan.
[00:59:25.535 --> 00:59:29.037]  I'm calling from Fort Hood right now and I'm right now in the United States Army.
[00:59:52.595 --> 00:59:55.497]  And I've been listening to you for about the last two weeks.
[00:59:56.758 --> 01:00:06.624]  And, uh, just wanted to call and tell you how, uh, well, supportive I am about everything and tell you how this army is.
[01:00:08.846 --> 01:00:10.146]  Who else is there in the background?
[01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:10.827]  One of your friends?
[01:00:11.427 --> 01:00:13.148]  Oh, yeah, I'm in a barracks right now.
[01:00:13.489 --> 01:00:15.810]  Yeah, I'm in a barracks right now.
[01:00:17.191 --> 01:00:20.413]  Yeah, man, this army is full of Freemasons.
[01:00:20.553 --> 01:00:21.634]  I didn't even know what one was.
[01:00:22.304 --> 01:00:23.784]  Until I joined the Army.
[01:00:23.845 --> 01:00:24.625]  I didn't know what it was.
[01:00:25.085 --> 01:00:29.186]  I joined the Army and I started seeing all these, you know, the G sign and everything on everybody's vehicle.
[01:00:29.566 --> 01:00:31.167]  My platoon sergeant, he's one.
[01:00:31.627 --> 01:00:36.829]  And they use their rituals in the way they think.
[01:00:36.869 --> 01:00:38.269]  They try to use it on us.
[01:00:38.329 --> 01:00:43.271]  They force us by making us say creeds almost every week, every day.
[01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:44.551]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:00:44.591 --> 01:00:45.872]  I'm tired of it.
[01:00:47.052 --> 01:00:49.493]  So they've got you doing little brainwashing chants.
[01:00:49.893 --> 01:00:50.053]  Yeah.
[01:00:51.387 --> 01:00:57.032]  And I'm sure in all the military, if you're not one, you're not going to get ahead.
[01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.975]  If you're not one, you're not going to get ahead and go up in ranks.
[01:01:00.896 --> 01:01:04.279]  Well, it's big news in England that there are no judges who aren't Masons.
[01:01:04.359 --> 01:01:06.201]  Most of the barristers, the lawyers are.
[01:01:06.901 --> 01:01:09.424]  And basically, they can't be sent to prison.
[01:01:09.464 --> 01:01:10.565]  It's almost impossible.
[01:01:11.261 --> 01:01:15.483]  And I know that because I had ancestors who were Masons, and one of them told my dad about it.
[01:01:15.523 --> 01:01:22.606]  I've told the story many times about how he had murder charges on him, and he had shot and killed, I think it was two people.
[01:01:23.206 --> 01:01:24.387]  They were trying to rob him.
[01:01:24.407 --> 01:01:25.888]  It was back during Prohibition.
[01:01:25.908 --> 01:01:32.551]  He was running bars in Houston, but he did the Mason in distress, and that judge said, Case Dismissed.
[01:01:33.831 --> 01:01:39.854]  And that's probably not the best system in our free society to have folks be above the law.
[01:01:42.859 --> 01:01:44.280]  Yeah, I've noticed that a lot.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:52.706]  There's been a couple of guys who, when they get in trouble, I don't know, I'm pretty sure most of them are Masons, and they get off easy.
[01:01:52.886 --> 01:02:00.212]  And some other people who do get in trouble or not, they get kicked out of the Army or they get the full set of punishment.
[01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:03.514]  It's a pretty serious problem.
[01:02:03.574 --> 01:02:05.135]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:02:05.716 --> 01:02:11.700]  What's the feeling on base about the Iran war coming up and four years running now with the Iraq invasion?
[01:02:12.318 --> 01:02:16.480]  Well, as of right now, my unit just came back from Iraq.
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.101]  I just spent a year in Baghdad.
[01:02:19.261 --> 01:02:19.781]  How was it?
[01:02:21.382 --> 01:02:22.602]  I don't want to go back there again.
[01:02:23.583 --> 01:02:24.883]  I'm getting out in October.
[01:02:25.003 --> 01:02:27.104]  I'm out of the Army.
[01:02:27.424 --> 01:02:28.064]  It's pretty bad.
[01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:29.565]  I'm not going back there again.
[01:02:30.325 --> 01:02:31.706]  What was the morale?
[01:02:31.846 --> 01:02:34.207]  I mean, on average, how many people think it's great?
[01:02:34.987 --> 01:02:35.267]  Low.
[01:02:35.587 --> 01:02:36.108]  Very low.
[01:02:37.628 --> 01:02:39.109]  Just like everybody else in the country.
[01:02:40.031 --> 01:02:41.412]  They always ask, why are we over here?
[01:02:41.612 --> 01:02:42.292]  Why are we over here?
[01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:45.353]  First, we never found no, uh, chemical weapons.
[01:02:45.373 --> 01:02:47.034]  You know, we never found one.
[01:02:47.154 --> 01:02:55.017]  I, uh, I myself, well, I can't say you got the little man, uh, on air, but, uh, I myself actually seen some bombs while I was over there.
[01:02:57.739 --> 01:02:59.119]  So you were in the green zone?
[01:02:59.879 --> 01:03:00.140]  Yes.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.480]  I can't say exactly where.
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:05.742]  I actually gave you too much, but, uh, I can't say where, but yeah, I was in the green zone.
[01:03:08.715 --> 01:03:15.461]  Well, we appreciate you calling, and sometime when we've got more time, call back in and tell us some of the things you witnessed.
[01:03:15.901 --> 01:03:19.704]  Give us an account of what life in Baghdad was like.
[01:03:20.645 --> 01:03:21.486]  Okay, I will.
[01:03:22.307 --> 01:03:23.568]  Anything else you wanted to add?
[01:03:24.288 --> 01:03:29.593]  I just want to say thanks for putting me on air, and hey, if it's possible, try to come down to Austin.
[01:03:29.713 --> 01:03:31.214]  I mean, I'm at 400.
[01:03:31.414 --> 01:03:34.257]  I can disclose some more stuff in person, but I can't do it on air.
[01:03:35.669 --> 01:03:37.091]  I understand.
[01:03:37.131 --> 01:03:38.874]  Yeah, come to an event sometime we have.
[01:03:38.914 --> 01:03:40.777]  We can talk off the side for a few minutes.
[01:03:41.399 --> 01:03:42.180]  Good to hear from you.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.262]  We support the troops.
[01:03:43.302 --> 01:03:44.945]  We don't support how they're being used.
[01:03:45.346 --> 01:03:46.568]  That's a clear distinction.
[01:03:47.028 --> 01:03:47.770]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:55.325 --> 01:04:00.770]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:08.797]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:09.511 --> 01:04:16.554]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:28.379]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:32.361]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:32.641 --> 01:04:34.582]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:34.922 --> 01:04:38.764]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:56.360]  I can't believe it.
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.601]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car.
[01:05:59.961 --> 01:06:02.482]  And here we are with season tickets on the 50 yard line.
[01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:04.661]  I know what you mean, John.
[01:06:04.681 --> 01:06:08.842]  I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[01:06:09.403 --> 01:06:13.204]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:06:13.304 --> 01:06:14.884]  I was struggling to make ends meet.
[01:06:15.344 --> 01:06:20.206]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.
[01:06:20.526 --> 01:06:21.586]  And I owe it all to you.
[01:06:22.186 --> 01:06:25.489]  Because you told me about DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:06:25.569 --> 01:06:28.612]  Hey John, we all win when the money problems disappear.
[01:06:28.632 --> 01:06:29.973]  I want to tell everybody.
[01:06:30.193 --> 01:06:33.556]  Because the more people we have on the success team, the better it works.
[01:06:33.916 --> 01:06:35.597]  It's hard for the little guy these days.
[01:06:35.878 --> 01:06:38.520]  We pool our resources to level the playing field.
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:44.865]  So the more people that go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com, the more cash for everybody.
[01:06:45.125 --> 01:06:45.966]  What a concept!

[01:07:57.881 --> 01:07:58.701]  You missed something.

[01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:09.544]  It's all free.
[01:08:10.004 --> 01:08:11.785]  Getting the information out there.

[01:08:23.436 --> 01:08:27.017]  Alright, he's with us until the bottom of the hour, and we're honored to have him for that period.
[01:08:27.417 --> 01:08:42.621]  And then we're going to go right back to your calls, Roger and Norman and Jason, and I'm going to do a phone blitz where we take a lot of your calls until the next hour when Jason Berman joins us to talk about attempts at internet censorship and some really scary stuff that's happening around the world.
[01:08:43.401 --> 01:08:48.843]  Greg Pallas joins us to talk about Target Iran, what's happening with the Libby trial, what's happening in Venezuela.
[01:08:50.723 --> 01:09:00.991]  Greg Pallas, the author of the New York Times bestseller, Armed Madhouse, and the film before that in the book was The Best Democracy Money Could Buy.
[01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:02.492]  He's also a documentary filmmaker.
[01:09:02.532 --> 01:09:05.754]  He's done work for ABC News, BBC, London Guardian.
[01:09:06.015 --> 01:09:07.055]  Thanks for coming on, Greg.
[01:09:07.536 --> 01:09:08.997]  Glad to be with you, Alex, again.
[01:09:10.218 --> 01:09:13.080]  There's a lot of stuff I want to cover in the 20 minutes we've got you now.
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:18.364]  Let's first get into Iran and your take on what's really going on behind the scenes there.
[01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:29.983]  Well, I mean, to some extent, obviously they're rattling the sabers, but obviously we can't control, you know, like the supermarkets in Baghdad level take over Tehran.
[01:09:30.504 --> 01:09:39.650]  So, I think it's very important to look at it as, don't look at the Libby trial, let's look at Mad Maqbood in Tehran.
[01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:41.391]  That's the first thing we should be looking at.
[01:09:43.753 --> 01:09:48.836]  You know, obviously they don't want us looking at the Libby trial, because the Libby trial isn't about Libby.
[01:09:49.804 --> 01:09:58.732]  It's about, um, it is a view into an entire disinformation machine.
[01:09:59.733 --> 01:10:07.941]  It's a view into how the administration set out to deliberately, and unfortunately successfully, manipulate news.
[01:10:08.882 --> 01:10:10.203]  And that's the real story there.
[01:10:10.383 --> 01:10:15.608]  And they don't want you talking about that, so they've got, you know, they've got bombs in Iran, and
[01:10:16.115 --> 01:10:22.900]  You know, they're sending aircraft carriers... Will the fellow over at Meet the Press survive the fact that it's now been exposed that he was a willing puppet?
[01:10:23.921 --> 01:10:30.966]  Well, I mean, what was horrible is, look at the... there's been a whole parade of a half-dozen characters, and the worst being Bob Woodward.
[01:10:31.006 --> 01:10:32.487]  You know, it's shameful.
[01:10:33.047 --> 01:10:40.592]  I mean, I think that Bernstein should just prohibit Woodward from attaching his name to the concept of investigative reporting.
[01:10:40.612 --> 01:10:45.776]  He's a gossip monger who basically has been a willing conduit, just like Judith Miller in the New York Times.
[01:10:46.719 --> 01:10:52.720]  The New York Times forced her out, but she wasn't the bad one, she was just following the normal New York Times procedure.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:11:06.964]  Now the same guy who co-wrote with her on the aluminum tubes, he's the one, two days before the Pentagon even broke it, clear conduit, breaking the news about plastic explosives from Iran to Iraq.
[01:11:09.828 --> 01:11:17.751]  Obviously, there's kind of an irony in complaining about Iran sending a few weapons into Iraq.
[01:11:19.172 --> 01:11:24.654]  After all, we're 10,000 miles away and we say that being in Iraq is foreign national security.
[01:11:24.694 --> 01:11:30.476]  This is a nation that's on their border with which they've had a brutal war that killed a half a million people.
[01:11:31.236 --> 01:11:38.619]  They obviously have an interest in Iraq and for very little change they can make a very
[01:11:39.304 --> 01:11:40.565]  You know, big amount of trouble.
[01:11:41.986 --> 01:11:49.851]  These are not sweethearts in Iran, but obviously we're looking for reasons to kick them around a bit.
[01:11:49.891 --> 01:11:56.615]  Put it in layman's terms, I want to get back into Iraq and Iran later before you leave us, but right now the Libby trial, you're an expert on the Bushes.
[01:11:57.376 --> 01:11:59.337]  You've had them come after you unaccessibly before.
[01:11:59.397 --> 01:12:04.200]  Last year they tried to have you arrested for showing a FEMA camp when you were doing an ABC News piece.
[01:12:05.881 --> 01:12:08.483]  Go back through what's really happening with Libby for those that don't know.
[01:12:09.183 --> 01:12:23.754]  Right, well what's happened is that it turns out that this is just part of a long campaign by, orchestrated mainly by the Vice President, by Dick Cheney to, you know, first of all exposing the name of a U.S.
[01:12:23.874 --> 01:12:36.683]  secret agent, you know, endangers the, you know, in a way it's, you know, if someone else did it would be treason for God's sake, but the excuse by the reason, this is very interesting, the reason Dick Cheney has not been charged with a crime
[01:12:37.472 --> 01:12:43.075]  Is that the President, and by extension the Vice President, can make exceptions to the law on national security.
[01:12:43.775 --> 01:12:50.799]  So that is the only reason he hasn't been charged with outing a, uh, a, uh, a, um, a foreign, a U.S.
[01:12:50.839 --> 01:12:51.539]  foreign agent.
[01:12:51.639 --> 01:12:54.600]  So they're invoking the... He's allowed to make his own, uh, exceptions to the rule.
[01:12:54.861 --> 01:12:56.781]  So they're invoking the Fuhrer Principle.
[01:12:57.042 --> 01:12:57.922]  Yeah.
[01:12:57.942 --> 01:12:58.702]  We are the law.
[01:12:59.283 --> 01:12:59.503]  Right?
[01:12:59.543 --> 01:13:00.183]  We are the law.
[01:13:00.223 --> 01:13:03.985]  So if we, if we say, give out the name, then it's okay.
[01:13:04.545 --> 01:13:05.446]  Um, by definition.
[01:13:05.466 --> 01:13:06.006]  So that's why
[01:13:06.781 --> 01:13:12.184]  Libby is only on trial for a process charge, obstruction of justice.
[01:13:13.005 --> 01:13:18.368]  But it is really, he was simply covering up for the Vice President.
[01:13:18.768 --> 01:13:29.474]  But what's interesting is the parade of journalists who admitted that they were handed material and that this is not unusual, this is a process that they go through continually.
[01:13:30.155 --> 01:13:31.916]  So that basically we have
[01:13:32.523 --> 01:13:39.386]  We have something worse than a Zvezda or Pravda, because at least in the Soviet Union, no one believed Zvezda or Pravda.
[01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:54.773]  But when the material was handed to the New York Times or Washington Post, or Bob Woodward, Judith Miller, whatever, and Newsweek was in on this, Meet the Press, the networks, we have the impression that we are getting independent news.
[01:13:55.693 --> 01:14:01.856]  So unlike the former citizens of the Soviet Union, we actually
[01:14:03.208 --> 01:14:05.750]  Pretend that we have a free press that isn't controlled.
[01:14:06.912 --> 01:14:16.901]  But isn't that starting to change because of the $1.6 billion in fake news purchases that came out and the Armstrong-Williams and the Libby trial coming out now?
[01:14:17.462 --> 01:14:25.249]  Alex, if people listen to your program, yeah, but most Americans are still kind of sucking on that single conduit.
[01:14:25.269 --> 01:14:26.070]  It's either Fox or NBC, CBS,
[01:14:29.122 --> 01:14:35.164]  CNN, Washington Post, New York Times, it's still in that blind alley.
[01:14:35.344 --> 01:14:43.267]  How can you call it liberal media when it's been CNN and CBS and NBC and ABC that are some of the worst offenders?
[01:14:43.954 --> 01:14:44.635]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:44.675 --> 01:14:52.340]  That's the other thing is that basically they're taking direct feed from the administration and then still get called, you know, the liberal media.
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:55.382]  That's because, you know, because they are social liberals.
[01:14:55.422 --> 01:14:58.805]  That is, they're pro-abortion or they're pro-affirmative action.
[01:14:58.845 --> 01:15:06.770]  But when it comes to issues of war and class and money and control, there's really no Democratic or Republican.
[01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:11.734]  There's one party that's kind of what I call Hespa Shekel, the party of money, the party of the cash.
[01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:13.535]  It's one little group.
[01:15:14.901 --> 01:15:18.702]  What do you see happening with Bush in his last year and a half in office?
[01:15:18.722 --> 01:15:20.142]  Do you think he'll survive?
[01:15:21.243 --> 01:15:22.343]  I think he'll survive.
[01:15:22.363 --> 01:15:35.246]  The thing is that he's expendable to the Republican Party, which means they're going to load on all the evils, public evils onto him, while still the private evils will continue on, you know, supported by both parties.
[01:15:35.266 --> 01:15:38.307]  And we're looking at major changes in regulation.
[01:15:38.347 --> 01:15:42.328]  I think one of the more dangerous things that's happening is that Bush has ordered
[01:15:43.584 --> 01:15:56.974]  That in every single agency, that there be a political appointee, kind of like a commissar, who will look over what every agency does, whether it's health and safety, environmental, wage and hour law, any of that.
[01:15:56.994 --> 01:16:07.802]  You'll always have, Food and Drug Administration, you'll have a political appointee looking over the shoulders of these agencies which are supposed to be enforcing our protection rules.
[01:16:08.823 --> 01:16:10.204]  So that's the type of thing that's going on.
[01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:22.335]  Shifting gears to Iran, there's major carrier task forces there in place, all these reports now about, oh, Iran may get a nuke in three years now, they can't be stopped.
[01:16:23.916 --> 01:16:32.940]  A lot of experts think they're going to have a sneak attack, or Israel is, maybe even using mini-nukes, bunker-buster nukes, tactical weapons on Iran.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.081]  Do you think there's anything to that?
[01:16:34.713 --> 01:16:36.414]  Well, they're always going to make plans.
[01:16:36.434 --> 01:16:38.616]  I think the main thing is to keep the pot boiling.
[01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:40.458]  You have to have all war all the time.
[01:16:40.518 --> 01:16:42.839]  You can't have a war president unless there's a war boiling.
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:46.462]  And Iraq is losing its charm, at least.
[01:16:47.403 --> 01:16:50.205]  So there has to be always a threat out there.
[01:16:50.445 --> 01:17:00.113]  Because remember, what's happening with Iraq is not only is the war going bad, but no one considers Iraq a threat, except for the poor kids who were sent there, where it's a threat to them.
[01:17:00.834 --> 01:17:04.555]  But no one thinks that Iraq is now is any longer in danger to Los Angeles.
[01:17:04.595 --> 01:17:05.515]  That line won't work.
[01:17:05.895 --> 01:17:08.196]  So how do you maintain the concept of a threat?
[01:17:08.236 --> 01:17:09.716]  How do you maintain Guantanamo?
[01:17:09.736 --> 01:17:20.459]  How do you maintain a state of continuing war and therefore, you know, all the limits on civil rights and all the shenanigans which are going on and basically setting up an internal spying mechanism in the U.S.?
[01:17:20.779 --> 01:17:23.740]  You have to maintain a war threat all the time.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:27.261]  So Iran serves the purpose right now of the new war threat.
[01:17:27.882 --> 01:17:31.083]  They're better as a threat than, in fact, an actuality.
[01:17:31.163 --> 01:17:35.405]  I mean, so that if we had it out with these guys, then you'd lose the threat.
[01:17:35.445 --> 01:17:37.845]  I think that it's very important to keep the pot boiling.
[01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:39.526]  And that works on both sides.
[01:17:39.746 --> 01:17:47.549]  Mad Makhmoud, who's, you know, the president in Tehran, it is to his purpose to keep the pot boiling as well.
[01:17:47.909 --> 01:17:54.071]  He'll be... The mullahs, who really control him from the background, are gonna, you know, are gonna put some limits on him.
[01:17:54.111 --> 01:17:56.612]  But basically, he and, you know, basically,
[01:17:58.084 --> 01:18:03.708]  Ahmadinejad and Bush are a little tag team who are, you know, keeping the game going.
[01:18:03.888 --> 01:18:23.262]  In fact, all the major CIA reports and other groups that have done analysis are reporting that if they were just left alone, and Iran was left alone, that clearly reforms would happen and the system is on the verge of being overthrown, but that by having a posture of military threat against them, it's the only thing keeping the hardliners in power.
[01:18:23.968 --> 01:18:24.348]  Of course.
[01:18:24.509 --> 01:18:27.891]  I mean, just like we have, they're coming to get us.
[01:18:28.092 --> 01:18:29.593]  The crazy guys are coming to get us.
[01:18:29.653 --> 01:18:30.534]  They have the same thing.
[01:18:30.574 --> 01:18:35.758]  Look, the Americans have aircraft carriers off our shores, right?
[01:18:36.158 --> 01:18:39.261]  So they keep the game going as well.
[01:18:39.341 --> 01:18:46.387]  They've got a problem right now with Saudi Arabia squeezing them by pulling down the price of oil to a little over 50 bucks a barrel.
[01:18:46.447 --> 01:18:47.247]  It's still high.
[01:18:47.448 --> 01:18:47.828]  Stay there.
[01:18:47.868 --> 01:18:49.029]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[01:18:49.149 --> 01:18:50.210]  We'll be back with Greg Palast.
[01:18:52.541 --> 01:18:57.506]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[01:20:20.862 --> 01:20:23.904]  1998, gold jumps 2 thirds over the Russian ruble.
[01:20:23.924 --> 01:20:26.666]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[01:20:26.907 --> 01:20:32.131]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[01:20:32.291 --> 01:20:33.592]  Could government let this happen?
[01:20:33.712 --> 01:20:35.694]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[01:20:35.954 --> 01:20:43.060]  Midas has Nick Bereshoff's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:44.861]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[01:20:44.901 --> 01:20:48.564]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[01:20:48.604 --> 01:20:51.246]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:51.686 --> 01:20:58.632]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America while the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[01:20:59.873 --> 01:21:03.936]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[01:21:04.665 --> 01:21:11.690]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[01:21:12.591 --> 01:21:21.358]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[01:22:26.337 --> 01:22:26.617]  I'm good.
[01:22:54.829 --> 01:22:55.790]  Welcome back.
[01:22:55.810 --> 01:22:58.731]  Greg Pallis is our guest.
[01:22:58.791 --> 01:23:00.632]  Final segment with him.
[01:23:00.712 --> 01:23:06.874]  We'll go right to your calls and a ton of other important news items.
[01:23:24.867 --> 01:23:29.311]  Greg, the new book again, of course, is Arm Madhouse and the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:23:29.351 --> 01:23:30.972]  The website is gregpalast.com.
[01:23:31.012 --> 01:23:33.634]  Links to it up on infowars.com right now.
[01:23:33.674 --> 01:23:38.438]  Continuing with what you were saying about the Saudis, why have we seen a lowering?
[01:23:38.498 --> 01:23:43.942]  Certainly, it more than doubled from 2002 through 2006.
[01:23:44.242 --> 01:23:47.505]  Now we've seen it drop by about $20 a barrel on average.
[01:23:47.545 --> 01:23:49.146]  How low will it go and what's behind that?
[01:23:49.767 --> 01:23:57.935]  Well, we were down, in the Clinton administration, we were down around $20 to $25 a barrel, then it went up to $77 a barrel.
[01:23:59.436 --> 01:24:05.341]  The price of oil went up, averaged about 120% above normal so far during the war.
[01:24:06.342 --> 01:24:09.085]  And, yeah, the Saudis were squeezing us.
[01:24:09.165 --> 01:24:10.166]  They've now
[01:24:11.269 --> 01:24:13.650]  You know, they've been keeping oil off the market.
[01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:15.311]  We have a cartel.
[01:24:15.491 --> 01:24:17.011]  It was shot lower.
[01:24:17.331 --> 01:24:19.532]  In part, that was the October surprise.
[01:24:19.592 --> 01:24:25.894]  That is, that was meant to help Bush during the midterms, but I guess the life raft was not big enough.
[01:24:26.475 --> 01:24:33.757]  But even more important, my sources in the industry said the Saudis were much more interested in sticking it to Iran, which is their rival.
[01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:36.518]  The Saudis are Sunnis, Wahhabi Sunnis.
[01:24:37.198 --> 01:24:38.739]  The Iranians are Shia.
[01:24:39.871 --> 01:24:52.393]  And the Iranians want to maintain a stable price of oil, but Saudis like to see it go through the roof, and then smash it down, which destroys any alternatives, whether it's conservation or oil from Venezuela or any other alternative.
[01:24:52.573 --> 01:24:54.054]  It's a monopoly strategy.
[01:24:54.434 --> 01:24:55.514]  Right, it's a monopoly strategy.
[01:24:55.534 --> 01:25:06.276]  You keep all the others out of the market by maintaining a very high price, and then suddenly when others jump in, you smash the price down, you bankrupt everyone, whether it's the oil, the guys who were melting the oil sands in Canada,
[01:25:06.756 --> 01:25:08.637]  We're spending 30 bucks a barrel to do that.
[01:25:08.677 --> 01:25:12.100]  You drop the price to 20 and you've now bankrupted the Canadians.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.540]  You've bankrupted the Venezuelans.
[01:25:13.561 --> 01:25:17.343]  I mean, every time they do this, it kills Texas wildcatters that I know.
[01:25:17.363 --> 01:25:19.144]  These small companies that go out and drill.
[01:25:19.404 --> 01:25:19.825]  That's right.
[01:25:19.845 --> 01:25:26.569]  Every time the price is up to 40, 50 bucks, you've got the wildcatters out there with their stripper wells, whatever they can do.
[01:25:27.369 --> 01:25:29.491]  The price drops to 20 and they go bust.
[01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:32.313]  So, the Saudis know exactly what they're doing.
[01:25:32.373 --> 01:25:34.234]  Now, the other thing that the Saudis know that they're doing
[01:25:34.787 --> 01:25:37.029]  Is making sure we keep our troops there.
[01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:47.820]  Over Thanksgiving, the King of Saudi Arabia, Abdullah, called Dick Cheney in to kiss his throne over Thanksgiving.
[01:25:48.181 --> 01:25:54.327]  I mean, this is a new one, where the King of Saudi Arabia told the Vice President of the United States, you arrive in Riyadh tomorrow.
[01:25:54.928 --> 01:25:55.829]  That's quite amazing.
[01:25:57.976 --> 01:26:02.377]  And what's not amazing, though, unfortunately, is that Cheney did just that.
[01:26:02.397 --> 01:26:16.381]  He went to Riyadh, and he was told by King Abdullah, you will not remove your troops from Iraq, because they're afraid that their two things, that their Sunni brothers will get slaughtered, and there's some truth to that, and the other is that, even worse, that the Iranians
[01:26:17.219 --> 01:26:21.781]  We'll get control of Iraq's oil and therefore be able to challenge the Saudis.
[01:26:21.901 --> 01:26:25.563]  And then Bush said, yes sir boss, I'm going to put even more troops in.
[01:26:25.923 --> 01:26:27.383]  That's right.
[01:26:27.944 --> 01:26:29.664]  I have a very simple solution.
[01:26:30.164 --> 01:26:33.406]  If Abdul thinks we need more troops in Iraq, you know what?
[01:26:33.786 --> 01:26:35.447]  Call them up and send them.
[01:26:36.107 --> 01:26:40.969]  Their army has more goodies and toys than any army on the planet, per soldier.
[01:26:41.349 --> 01:26:43.250]  Let them go and protect their Sunni brothers.
[01:26:44.055 --> 01:26:51.160]  You know, it seems that the marching song for the Saudi Arabian Army is onward, Christian soldiers.
[01:26:51.641 --> 01:27:04.990]  Every time they need an army to clean someone out of Kuwait, to protect the Sunnis in Iraq, somehow their 101st Airborne becomes their mercenary force.
[01:27:05.290 --> 01:27:10.634]  Alright, final question for Greg Pallas, BBC reporter, writes for major news publications.
[01:27:12.421 --> 01:27:13.081]  Democrats.
[01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:15.202]  They were sent there to get us out of the war.
[01:27:15.262 --> 01:27:16.362]  That was the clear mandate.
[01:27:16.662 --> 01:27:20.964]  High 70s of Americans in major polls want the troops back.
[01:27:21.024 --> 01:27:22.564]  Instead, continual escalation.
[01:27:22.824 --> 01:27:26.325]  Hillary saying in AIPAC meetings, yeah, go ahead and nuke Iran.
[01:27:27.126 --> 01:27:30.867]  What's going to happen now that Democrats understand that their party is totally bought and paid for?
[01:27:32.131 --> 01:27:39.554]  Well, I think what happens is that people get discouraged, which is unfortunate, and there's a lot of disillusionment which sets in.
[01:27:39.614 --> 01:27:43.735]  People voted against the war, and the only discussion about it is whether we surge or not.
[01:27:44.375 --> 01:27:45.976]  They've totally done a bait-and-switch.
[01:27:46.156 --> 01:27:49.697]  We're talking about whether to surge and not what are we doing about getting the troops back.
[01:27:49.717 --> 01:27:50.097]  No, I agree.
[01:27:51.998 --> 01:27:54.059]  Unfortunately, it leads to some disillusionment.
[01:27:55.859 --> 01:28:07.203]  But, you know, I just hope that people don't get disillusioned, because I do think that ultimately there's a long history in America of populist uprisings, of populist sentiment taking control of the government.
[01:28:07.743 --> 01:28:12.125]  And I think that the popular will ultimately prevail here.
[01:28:12.445 --> 01:28:13.185]  No, I agree.
[01:28:13.205 --> 01:28:13.806]  I agree.
[01:28:13.826 --> 01:28:14.766]  Everybody's waking up.
[01:28:14.806 --> 01:28:15.566]  People are angry.
[01:28:15.606 --> 01:28:17.627]  The left-right paradigm is being shattered.
[01:28:17.647 --> 01:28:20.288]  Greg, we've got to get you back in studio sometime in the near future.
[01:28:20.328 --> 01:28:22.609]  Get you on for a full hour from a landline.
[01:28:22.869 --> 01:28:25.630]  Thanks for popping in with your view on things.
[01:28:25.650 --> 01:28:26.290]  We appreciate it.
[01:28:26.711 --> 01:28:27.371]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:28:27.930 --> 01:28:28.270]  Take care.
[01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:29.230]  There goes Reg Pallast.
[01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:30.551]  Alright, you've been holding patiently.
[01:28:30.591 --> 01:28:33.491]  We'll get to Roger, Norman, Jason, and many others.
[01:28:33.531 --> 01:28:34.632]  I'm gonna move quickly through your calls.
[01:28:35.192 --> 01:28:37.792]  On the other side, it's the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:38.532 --> 01:28:40.473]  It's often imitated, never duplicated.
[01:28:42.813 --> 01:28:43.714]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.194 --> 01:28:45.814]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.714 --> 01:28:49.415]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.418 --> 01:28:55.100]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.462]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:28:57.702 --> 01:29:00.224]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:29:00.664 --> 01:29:05.027]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[01:29:05.148 --> 01:29:05.728]  Here's why.
[01:29:05.748 --> 01:29:12.393]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:29:12.673 --> 01:29:19.098]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[01:29:19.278 --> 01:29:23.022]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:29:23.242 --> 01:29:27.486]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:35.113]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:29:35.553 --> 01:29:37.956]  Get control, get relief, get some sleep!
[01:29:38.256 --> 01:29:39.257]  Go to www.outand90.com.
[01:29:39.297 --> 01:29:40.198]  That's www.outand90.com.
[01:29:40.319 --> 01:29:40.799]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:41.039 --> 01:29:41.260]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:29:53.214 --> 01:29:54.394]  Hey Jane, how's it going?
[01:29:54.735 --> 01:29:56.675]  Gosh, I'm not doing so well.
[01:29:56.895 --> 01:30:00.836]  Even though I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do, my blood sugar is way out of control.
[01:30:01.397 --> 01:30:03.057]  Oh Jane, I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:30:03.297 --> 01:30:05.398]  I have to monitor my blood sugar again.
[01:30:05.618 --> 01:30:10.739]  If there was only something natural I could take that would help control my blood sugar that really works.
[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:12.360]  Have you tried sucroblast?
[01:30:13.171 --> 01:30:18.253]  For millions of Americans who can't keep their high blood sugar levels off their minds, there's Sucroblast.
[01:30:18.813 --> 01:30:23.174]  Sucroblast is the all-natural way to help keep your high blood sugar levels under control.

[01:30:28.236 --> 01:30:30.637]  Call 1-800-99-HEALTHY.
[01:30:31.017 --> 01:30:33.338]  That's 1-800-99-HEALTHY.
[01:30:33.798 --> 01:30:37.599]  Or visit them on the web at MyBloodSugarBreakthrough.com.
[01:30:37.979 --> 01:30:39.720]  That's MyBloodSugarBreakthrough.com.
[01:30:41.488 --> 01:30:42.669]  So Jane, what do you think?
[01:30:42.909 --> 01:30:46.772]  I'm going to call Sucroblast to set up a free consultation right now!
[01:30:47.092 --> 01:30:47.872]  Excellent, Jane.
[01:30:47.973 --> 01:30:49.173]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:30:49.193 --> 01:30:54.737]  Hello?
[01:30:54.897 --> 01:30:55.918]  Hey, it's me.
[01:30:56.198 --> 01:30:58.100]  I got something, man, I want you to look at.
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:58.840]  What?
[01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:00.061]  What is it now?
[01:31:00.461 --> 01:31:02.403]  It's called OneYearToRetire.net
[01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:06.171]  When you get home, I want you to go to OneYearToRetire.net.
[01:31:06.231 --> 01:31:07.591]  Come on, you gotta be kidding.
[01:31:08.051 --> 01:31:09.132]  One year to retire?
[01:31:09.372 --> 01:31:12.092]  When are you gonna get it through your head that there is no quick fix?
[01:31:12.432 --> 01:31:13.133]  No free lunch?
[01:31:13.673 --> 01:31:13.953]  I know.
[01:31:14.313 --> 01:31:15.073]  I agree with you.
[01:31:15.213 --> 01:31:16.174]  This isn't like that.
[01:31:16.734 --> 01:31:20.355]  It's an ingenious system that's designed to help you retire in one year.
[01:31:20.375 --> 01:31:25.856]  I was skeptical too, but the system is free, and when I looked at it, I was sure it would work.
[01:31:26.476 --> 01:31:27.357]  What have you got to lose?
[01:31:27.397 --> 01:31:27.917]  It's free.
[01:31:28.337 --> 01:31:28.577]  Well?
[01:31:29.173 --> 01:31:33.334]  All you have to do is go to OneYearToRetire.net and get a free system.
[01:31:33.894 --> 01:31:34.895]  It only takes a minute.
[01:31:35.095 --> 01:31:37.255]  You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.
[01:31:37.915 --> 01:31:39.836]  Go to OneYearToRetire.net.
[01:31:40.356 --> 01:31:42.517]  That's OneYearToRetire.net.
[01:31:43.097 --> 01:31:43.557]  Or call 888-200-0265.
[01:31:43.617 --> 01:31:43.797]  That's 888-200-0265.
[01:32:09.395 --> 01:32:10.055]  Welcome back.
[01:32:11.736 --> 01:32:13.717]  Let's go straight to your phone calls, as promised.
[01:32:15.978 --> 01:32:18.198]  Roger in Key West, Florida.
[01:32:18.258 --> 01:32:18.879]  You're on the air.
[01:32:18.939 --> 01:32:19.339]  Go ahead.
[01:32:19.359 --> 01:32:20.659]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:32:20.759 --> 01:32:21.140]  Good, sir.
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:24.521]  I called you about a month and a half ago.
[01:32:24.541 --> 01:32:25.881]  I don't know if you remember me.
[01:32:26.161 --> 01:32:29.503]  I talked to you about Anatoly Fomenko, the history.
[01:32:31.503 --> 01:32:32.424]  Refresh my memory.
[01:32:33.244 --> 01:32:37.466]  It was about this Russian mathematician who
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:44.321]  What a book, discrediting the history that we know.
[01:32:44.341 --> 01:32:48.222]  Oh, I do remember your call, yes.
[01:32:49.923 --> 01:32:51.423]  Anyway, it's not about that today.
[01:32:52.783 --> 01:32:53.804]  Just a couple of things.
[01:32:54.304 --> 01:32:56.824]  You were talking about global warming and the sun.
[01:32:57.024 --> 01:32:58.025]  I have to agree with you.
[01:32:58.085 --> 01:32:59.565]  I'm a bit of an astronomer.
[01:32:59.585 --> 01:33:03.986]  I have a very nice telescope and I read up on it all the time.
[01:33:04.666 --> 01:33:07.667]  And the sun's in the 26 and the solar system.
[01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:12.241]  It's in a 26,000 year orbit around the solar system.
[01:33:13.202 --> 01:33:26.326]  And the way that the Sun and the planets orbit around the Sun, it changes from an elliptical at one point, and that's when we have our cooler periods, to right now it's in a circular motion.
[01:33:26.746 --> 01:33:31.648]  So it doesn't have a chance to get into a cooling area when it gets a further distance away.
[01:33:31.968 --> 01:33:34.909]  Right now we're in a pretty consistent circular orbit.
[01:33:35.758 --> 01:33:40.281]  And that's why we're getting a lot of heat on the earth right now from the sun.
[01:33:41.802 --> 01:33:43.142]  I don't know if you were aware of that.
[01:33:43.162 --> 01:33:44.303]  Well, interesting.
[01:33:44.523 --> 01:33:45.784]  What type of telescope do you have?
[01:33:46.444 --> 01:33:48.705]  I have an ETX-125 Mead.
[01:33:48.746 --> 01:33:50.186]  It's a Ketida optic.
[01:33:50.226 --> 01:33:56.110]  Yeah, my dad's got a 10-inch Mead.
[01:33:56.610 --> 01:33:57.931]  That's a very nice telescope.
[01:33:58.311 --> 01:34:00.932]  Yeah, well, he bought it, I guess, about 15 years ago.
[01:34:00.952 --> 01:34:03.734]  He sent me down to San Antonio.
[01:34:03.814 --> 01:34:05.235]  Back then, they weren't sold in the
[01:34:06.016 --> 01:34:11.080]  He sent me down to some science supply house to buy it for him.
[01:34:11.961 --> 01:34:13.462]  I'm going to let you go.
[01:34:13.482 --> 01:34:15.783]  I appreciate your call because I heard some feedback there.
[01:34:17.825 --> 01:34:21.427]  I could take that thing out to Llano or Fredericksburg when I had family living out there.
[01:34:22.868 --> 01:34:27.032]  You could see the pink and orange and yellow colors of Saturn.
[01:34:27.072 --> 01:34:29.373]  You could see separation in the rings on a clear night.
[01:34:30.154 --> 01:34:33.837]  I couldn't imagine what it would be like to have that thing out in, say, Monument Valley,
[01:34:35.143 --> 01:34:38.406]  I was out there once and it was like the stars were just coming down out of the heavens.
[01:34:38.426 --> 01:34:40.047]  You could see every satellite going over.
[01:34:40.888 --> 01:34:41.989]  It was so beautiful.
[01:34:43.050 --> 01:34:46.693]  But with light pollution, it's fun to just get it out and use it in the city.
[01:34:46.713 --> 01:34:47.534]  It's not that big.
[01:34:48.995 --> 01:34:51.737]  And just like aim it at a house, say, 300 yards away.
[01:34:55.919 --> 01:34:58.500]  And no, I'm not trying to catch a woman undressing.
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:06.362]  What's fun is to look at geckos around a porch light hunting and eating bugs.
[01:35:06.482 --> 01:35:09.383]  And the geckos fill the viewfinder.
[01:35:09.403 --> 01:35:10.664]  They're just huge.
[01:35:11.684 --> 01:35:21.367]  And you can take it out in the woods and see a hawk up in a tree 500 yards away and zoom it in so close that you're looking right at its eye.
[01:35:22.518 --> 01:35:24.298]  I mean, that's how powerful those things are.
[01:35:24.318 --> 01:35:45.222]  And what's great about it is you aim it at a couple different way stars or pole stars that are always in the same position and then the computer calculates and then once you aim it at a nebula or a star cluster or a distant galaxy, if you're in clear enough viewing to do it, then it tracks it along with it.
[01:35:45.762 --> 01:35:51.723]  And that's what I, at the top of stuff I used to do on the weekend if I wasn't going to go fishing or camping or hiking.
[01:35:53.415 --> 01:36:01.637]  Up in the mountains, I would go over and throw my dad's telescope in the back of my truck and drive out.
[01:36:01.697 --> 01:36:03.918]  I also took photos of comets and galaxies.
[01:36:04.438 --> 01:36:10.999]  I could hook my 35mm camera into a coupler and just take unbelievable photos.
[01:36:11.079 --> 01:36:13.340]  I took time-lapse of star movement.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:18.301]  I took time-lapse of galaxies, nebulas, Jupiter, Saturn.
[01:36:19.938 --> 01:36:21.839]  Mercury, Venus, Mars.
[01:36:22.259 --> 01:36:28.323]  I took photos and you can see the canyon on Mars, the ice caps.
[01:36:29.604 --> 01:36:30.784]  That's what I'd like to do.
[01:36:31.244 --> 01:36:33.586]  That's what I'd like to spend my leisure time doing.
[01:36:33.606 --> 01:36:42.010]  I don't have leisure time because criminals that are worse than the Nazis and the Soviets are in control, building giant FEMA camps, and well, I have to fight them.
[01:36:44.072 --> 01:36:46.313]  Don't know why I've already digressed off into that, but sir,
[01:36:47.711 --> 01:36:50.372]  It isn't just the Earth's position to the Sun.
[01:36:50.432 --> 01:37:06.355]  The Sun's radiance itself, the nuclear furnace in its bowels, in the last 12-year cycle, and I simplify, it's right under 12-year cycle, was the highest radiance ever recorded, and they've been recording it for several hundred years accurately.
[01:37:06.896 --> 01:37:08.616]  So this isn't our opinion, this is fact.
[01:37:09.336 --> 01:37:10.956]  And they thought that would be the end of the cycle.
[01:37:11.017 --> 01:37:17.158]  It's now accelerating from that cycle, and at current radiance increase, it will be double
[01:37:18.112 --> 01:37:24.534]  It's not size, but double its emissions and heat in 11 years.
[01:37:26.254 --> 01:37:30.075]  And if that happens, it's not going to be pretty.
[01:37:30.095 --> 01:37:35.256]  And all of the... You could smash up every SUV and turn it into slag.
[01:37:35.797 --> 01:37:38.777]  We could shut down every plant that's coal-fired.
[01:37:39.397 --> 01:37:45.159]  We could somehow cap every volcano and tear up every piece of pavement.
[01:37:46.218 --> 01:37:48.660]  It doesn't affect the Sun.
[01:37:50.701 --> 01:38:08.371]  I guess there might be some Tractogillian calculation of reflection from the Earth back at the Sun, and perhaps some trillionth of a sub-fraction of a degree in some uppermost region of the Sun might have some resonance mirrored effect.
[01:38:09.572 --> 01:38:10.433]  You've got me there.
[01:38:10.593 --> 01:38:12.374]  But for all intents and purposes,
[01:38:14.401 --> 01:38:15.041]  It's the Sun.
[01:38:15.362 --> 01:38:16.963]  The entire solar system.
[01:38:17.403 --> 01:38:24.647]  Mars solar caps, solar caps, Mars ice caps are melting because of increased solar radiation.
[01:38:25.888 --> 01:38:33.693]  In the last 12 years the caps have receded in some areas by up to a hundred miles.
[01:38:34.574 --> 01:38:35.494]  Massive!
[01:38:38.476 --> 01:38:39.837]  That's because they think the caps are
[01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:44.592]  A lot thinner than ours and are more like a frosting around the edges.
[01:38:44.612 --> 01:38:46.634]  But the frosting... So it isn't just me.
[01:38:46.654 --> 01:38:53.778]  They pointed Mount Kilimanjaro in the last 50 years going from ice cap to not even having a cap year-round.
[01:38:54.118 --> 01:38:54.899]  I'm already digressing.
[01:38:54.939 --> 01:38:56.240]  The point is it's all complete fraud.
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:58.461]  I've got a big stack of news on that today.
[01:38:58.481 --> 01:39:02.223]  They're going to give us a global tax out of it.
[01:39:02.243 --> 01:39:03.164]  It has nothing to do with it.
[01:39:04.765 --> 01:39:07.327]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in South Dakota.
[01:39:07.347 --> 01:39:07.747]  Go ahead.
[01:39:10.174 --> 01:39:10.754]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:39:10.794 --> 01:39:11.154]  Welcome.
[01:39:11.454 --> 01:39:11.875]  How's it going?
[01:39:12.395 --> 01:39:12.695]  Good.
[01:39:13.215 --> 01:39:14.736]  I just want to talk to you about a few things.
[01:39:15.556 --> 01:39:19.937]  One thing I totally confirm about the change in the ITT tech industry.
[01:39:20.278 --> 01:39:22.538]  We're totally getting a lot of commercials for sheriffs and security.
[01:39:23.379 --> 01:39:26.400]  And I also had a quick idea about spreading the 9-11 truth.
[01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:28.801]  You know all those e-bayers out there?
[01:39:29.041 --> 01:39:30.721]  They just stick 9-11 truth videos out there?
[01:39:30.741 --> 01:39:32.682]  Stick free DVD or whatever?
[01:39:32.702 --> 01:39:34.523]  I thought that was a pretty good idea.
[01:39:34.903 --> 01:39:38.124]  And also the Simpsons episodes have
[01:39:39.212 --> 01:39:48.435]  I've kind of changed, you know, like I see like one episode was like all about free press and how Montgomery Burns had a control over all the information and stuff like that and they're trying to make a free press.
[01:39:48.995 --> 01:39:51.216]  We've got to not let them read the truth.
[01:39:51.236 --> 01:39:52.897]  Buy all the newspapers.
[01:39:53.277 --> 01:39:58.258]  Yeah, and then there's another one about the Bill of Rights, how it's going down the tubes and like they're all in FEMA camps and stuff like that.
[01:39:58.278 --> 01:39:59.479]  I thought that was pretty funny.
[01:40:01.226 --> 01:40:08.049]  Well, they also have the one where the aliens take over the planet, and then the one comes in and he goes, General, the resistance is getting worse.
[01:40:08.529 --> 01:40:12.271]  You said they'd love us, but they had weapons of mass disintegration.
[01:40:12.291 --> 01:40:20.034]  I don't watch a lot of it, but I do see clips online, and it is Fox, and so they're just giving the people what they demand.
[01:40:22.195 --> 01:40:26.917]  But overall, I think, yeah, The Simpsons is one of the better things that you see there.
[01:40:27.257 --> 01:40:29.018]  I forgot, what was the first point you brought up?
[01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:40.738]  Um, I think it was, um, like how the ITT tech industry, like now all the commercials are shifting toward like a Microsoft Certified, or they were Microsoft Certified, but now it's all like Sheriff, Security, and, you know, it's a total angle.
[01:40:40.758 --> 01:40:46.683]  I can see the same style of commercial, but instead of like the medical and the computer industry, it's more like the Sheriff and Security.
[01:40:46.703 --> 01:40:46.783]  Sure.
[01:40:46.903 --> 01:40:49.005]  Well, I appreciate your call, and those are some really great points.
[01:40:49.025 --> 01:40:50.666]  Let me just briefly elaborate on that.
[01:40:51.767 --> 01:40:55.770]  I tend to get sped up on air trying to cover all the information and don't detail it.
[01:40:58.749 --> 01:41:27.954]  The biggest increase, and you can go pull these numbers up, I've spent some time looking them up, and I've also read other press reports and it's been announced on television, radio, and in print, that the biggest growth in federal and state and even institutional educational funding, grants, where people are having their tuition provided for them by the government or institutions, the biggest growth
[01:41:28.875 --> 01:41:32.819]  In that, he is in Homeland Security Law Enforcement.
[01:41:33.559 --> 01:41:37.743]  And I've had on deans and regional heads of university systems.
[01:41:37.763 --> 01:41:38.904]  I had one on from Tennessee.
[01:41:38.964 --> 01:41:40.366]  He's part of Homeland Security.
[01:41:41.587 --> 01:41:43.689]  He's part of the neighborhood Homeland Security Watch.
[01:41:44.610 --> 01:41:47.032]  And at multiple schools that he's over,
[01:41:48.299 --> 01:41:57.562]  And he was going, yes, we have 14 new classes in one and 20-something in another, and yes, that's the funding we're getting from the government to supplement people's tuition.
[01:41:58.102 --> 01:42:00.242]  So, and for some reason I always have trouble with this word.
[01:42:00.682 --> 01:42:03.863]  What's it called when somebody gets their tuition paid for?
[01:42:05.224 --> 01:42:05.484]  John?
[01:42:06.484 --> 01:42:09.285]  For some reason, every time I try to think of this word, it just sticks.
[01:42:09.305 --> 01:42:12.225]  It's like some brain cell in my brain must be fried.
[01:42:12.945 --> 01:42:14.346]  John, what's it called when you
[01:42:16.053 --> 01:42:17.214]  Not a grant, not a loan.
[01:42:17.774 --> 01:42:18.934]  Those are other words for it.
[01:42:18.954 --> 01:42:21.315]  Not everybody knows what I'm talking about.
[01:42:21.335 --> 01:42:26.637]  About three or four months ago you were running the show and I couldn't remember then and you knew.
[01:42:26.657 --> 01:42:32.940]  I guess that same little cluster of brain cells in you, it doesn't matter.
[01:42:33.981 --> 01:42:34.561]  It doesn't matter.
[01:42:34.581 --> 01:42:37.462]  The whole thing is shifting over to the government funding.
[01:42:37.762 --> 01:42:41.944]  Like they fund the illegal aliens with more tuition, with more grants.
[01:42:44.196 --> 01:42:59.189]  Just like they have the banks giving them bank accounts and housing loans, you see a key corporate-slash-government move, and they even say on the LA Times on this that, oh yes, it's to help stop amnesty, or I mean help to stop blocking amnesty.
[01:42:59.349 --> 01:43:03.333]  We want to make sure that they grow roots here so they can't be kicked out.
[01:43:05.552 --> 01:43:08.794]  They said that in the AP a few months ago, now they're saying it here in the LA Times.
[01:43:08.814 --> 01:43:13.558]  Well, it's the same thing with... The big private banks literally print the money.
[01:43:13.618 --> 01:43:15.759]  They issue the money.
[01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:20.283]  And so they use it to engineer social engineering, social architecture.
[01:43:21.504 --> 01:43:24.606]  And everything is security guards, everything is law enforcement.
[01:43:25.066 --> 01:43:27.428]  They're now going to give security guards police powers.
[01:43:28.377 --> 01:43:32.880]  And in places like Singapore, there's like, what, seven, eight times the number of private police there are.
[01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:34.942]  Government police, they're unaccountable.
[01:43:35.302 --> 01:43:36.903]  The same thing's starting to happen here.
[01:43:37.263 --> 01:43:39.725]  Oh, Blackwater mercenary forces can operate.
[01:43:40.165 --> 01:43:50.652]  And yeah, it's been about a year since I've seen an ITT technical ad for electronics or computer programming or software engineering.
[01:43:51.052 --> 01:43:51.813]  And those are pretty good.
[01:43:51.893 --> 01:43:56.276]  You know, you can go get a two-year degree there and you could get jobs in the past and go make good money if you had skills.
[01:43:57.105 --> 01:44:00.566]  It certainly wasn't an engineering, a four or six or eight year degree.
[01:44:00.606 --> 01:44:07.247]  It wasn't a electrical engineer degree, but they were good jobs.
[01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:12.629]  I mean, a lot of people got jobs at Texas Instruments, Microsoft, at smaller tech companies.
[01:44:13.049 --> 01:44:14.189]  They're gone now, folks.
[01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:25.872]  Over 80% of the high-tech jobs have migrated in the last 20 years, and now that last 20% is migrating, or they're importing record numbers of skilled visa holders to this place, and it's a travesty.
[01:44:27.003 --> 01:44:35.045]  And yes, we joked about how soon you would go to McDonald's and the hamburger would somehow be delivered from China, India, or Mexico.
[01:44:35.105 --> 01:44:37.105]  Well, they've done as much as they can.
[01:44:37.765 --> 01:44:46.207]  Hundreds of McDonald's chains last year got rid of their tellers taking your order.
[01:44:46.507 --> 01:44:53.568]  It is someone in India and they take your order and then they transmit it over computer
[01:44:54.537 --> 01:44:58.740]  To the front window that then takes your money and gives you the food.
[01:45:01.121 --> 01:45:03.322]  And they've decided that it's better to do that.
[01:45:04.383 --> 01:45:07.505]  And it's with a cashless society the same thing is going to happen.
[01:45:08.504 --> 01:45:10.584]  They're going to phase out all service by and large.
[01:45:10.604 --> 01:45:15.085]  We'll just have a few security guards slash managers at Target, Walmart.
[01:45:15.425 --> 01:45:24.027]  You'll all have to self-serve, but it'll just, at first it's going to be in the self, you know, first they put in some self-serve lanes, then they phase out the service lanes, and it's all self-serve lanes.
[01:45:24.307 --> 01:45:29.348]  But the next thing we want to go to is a cart that just scans it as you load it, and then you just leave.
[01:45:29.808 --> 01:45:31.489]  You're like, oh great, that'll cut prices.
[01:45:31.589 --> 01:45:37.390]  Oh great, that'll, just like McDonald's 50 years ago pioneered having the trash can saying, thank you.
[01:45:38.095 --> 01:45:44.397]  And then, no, all you did was let them lower the quality, not have service there for you, and then you throw away your own food.
[01:45:46.257 --> 01:45:47.297]  And your table's dirty.
[01:45:47.517 --> 01:45:53.239]  Same thing with, oh, we're going to offer self-serve, and it'll cut back on gas prices.
[01:45:56.119 --> 01:46:02.701]  Until there's basically no service, and a whole entry-level position in the economy is destroyed, and it centralizes the economy.
[01:46:04.264 --> 01:46:05.625]  It's good to have more service.
[01:46:05.665 --> 01:46:08.487]  I've looked at the economic studies on this, but common sense already told me that.
[01:46:08.507 --> 01:46:12.069]  It's good to have people employed.
[01:46:12.109 --> 01:46:14.211]  It's good for any real organic economy.
[01:46:14.551 --> 01:46:16.252]  But a centralized economy doesn't want that.
[01:46:17.833 --> 01:46:25.198]  Your jobs are being destroyed by design, so you can only have government jobs, only have police jobs, only have prison jobs, or be in those prisons.
[01:46:26.619 --> 01:46:30.141]  Instead of having the great society make work, which was bad enough,
[01:46:32.561 --> 01:46:44.051]  And the make work programs previous to that under Roosevelt, which got you into the system, now it's going to be in the spy squads, in the tattletale squads.
[01:46:44.412 --> 01:46:46.093]  And I've heard people calling to talk radio.
[01:46:48.175 --> 01:46:54.701]  Last year I heard one guy calling to Neil Borch and he goes, yeah, I'm up here getting my master's degree in Homeland Security at Texas A&M.
[01:46:56.082 --> 01:46:57.243]  The word scholarship.
[01:46:57.955 --> 01:47:20.189]  And I've got a full-page scholarship, and I'm getting my master's now, and I crunch data mining and databases, and we look at, like when you rent a car, they're going to make you run a detailed background check, even on credit, and hooked into these governmental databases, and it's really great, and just there he is, snickering and laughing, oh, what a great new job they've made for you.
[01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:22.811]  See, they're shifting the control of the entire paradigm.
[01:47:23.291 --> 01:47:24.932]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[01:47:24.952 --> 01:47:25.733]  You're on the air, Tim.
[01:47:26.664 --> 01:47:27.604]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[01:47:28.045 --> 01:47:28.645]  Good to talk to you.
[01:47:28.665 --> 01:47:29.205]  What's on your mind?
[01:47:29.765 --> 01:47:37.649]  I was going over Article 1 of the Constitution and I came across two things I wanted to ask you about and see what you thought of that.
[01:47:38.189 --> 01:47:46.453]  One sentence states, to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States.
[01:47:46.533 --> 01:47:48.354]  How's the Federal Reserve getting around that one?
[01:47:50.215 --> 01:47:54.977]  The power was transferred to the Federal Reserve to direct
[01:47:55.858 --> 01:48:01.041]  via its private board, the actions of the Governmental Treasury Department.
[01:48:02.122 --> 01:48:05.684]  And then they are allowed, they basically violate the law.
[01:48:05.724 --> 01:48:08.625]  Since when does the Constitution stop these people?
[01:48:09.626 --> 01:48:21.873]  And then even non-shareholder banks or still member banks, then they're allowed to loan up to ten times and sometimes more out for any real reserves that they have accrued.
[01:48:23.171 --> 01:48:29.077]  Another interesting point here, which is more towards the war than money, but it's still indirectly connected.
[01:48:29.817 --> 01:48:40.768]  It says, this is all under Article 1, Section 8, to raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years.
[01:48:41.946 --> 01:48:45.008]  And we're going into the fourth year of the war here next month.
[01:48:45.488 --> 01:49:00.675]  Well that's right, plus it also says later you must have a declaration of war specifically stating the enemy and the goal and how long it is to be prosecuted before the president must return to receive orders from the Congress to then execute as the executive.
[01:49:00.956 --> 01:49:06.018]  He executes, he doesn't make law, he doesn't tell Congress what to do.
[01:49:06.518 --> 01:49:11.421]  The legislative is the strongest, then the judicial, then the executive.
[01:49:11.972 --> 01:49:15.353]  But instead they claim a unitary executive was total power.
[01:49:16.294 --> 01:49:19.034]  Did you hear Dave von Kleist last week or this week?
[01:49:19.054 --> 01:49:24.056]  He was talking about this interview that Shil O'Leilly did with Jim Fetzer.
[01:49:25.277 --> 01:49:26.237]  No, I didn't hear that.
[01:49:26.277 --> 01:49:34.880]  He put a stopwatch to it, and out of a six and a half minute interview, five minutes and one second was O'Leilly talking over him, telling him what a cookie was.
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:37.101]  That's good fox for you.
[01:49:37.141 --> 01:49:37.641]  We distort.
[01:49:38.297 --> 01:49:38.898]  You comply.
[01:49:38.918 --> 01:49:42.080]  I encourage people to read about Operation Mockingbird.
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:44.182]  It's all about the CIA media control.
[01:49:44.202 --> 01:49:45.583]  That's totally admitted.
[01:49:46.623 --> 01:49:48.345]  Alright, we'll be right back with more calls.
[01:49:48.405 --> 01:49:49.025]  Great call.
[01:49:49.225 --> 01:49:49.646]  Stay with us.
[01:49:55.595 --> 01:49:56.096]  It's here!
[01:49:56.296 --> 01:50:01.040]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:09.067]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.784 --> 01:50:16.827]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.227 --> 01:50:28.652]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.952 --> 01:50:32.894]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:32.934 --> 01:50:34.875]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.175 --> 01:50:39.037]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.311 --> 01:50:54.292]  Good morning, honey!
[01:50:54.652 --> 01:50:55.212]  Wow!

[01:51:00.936 --> 01:51:01.536]  Yeah.
[01:51:01.917 --> 01:51:03.337]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:51:03.718 --> 01:51:07.100]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:09.061]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:51:09.521 --> 01:51:11.223]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:51:11.603 --> 01:51:13.364]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:51:13.584 --> 01:51:14.505]  Honey, cheer up!
[01:51:14.845 --> 01:51:17.106]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:51:17.386 --> 01:51:17.687]  What?
[01:51:18.127 --> 01:51:28.593]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:51:28.894 --> 01:51:29.134]  You know?

[01:51:31.276 --> 01:51:32.117]  And, wow!
[01:51:32.317 --> 01:51:33.759]  Have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[01:51:34.059 --> 01:51:35.240]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[01:51:39.545 --> 01:51:40.826]  Travel Berkey not available in Iowa.
[01:51:52.284 --> 01:51:53.685]  Hey lady, you love to shop?
[01:51:53.765 --> 01:51:57.749]  Then visit HerbalHealer.com to browse through their online catalog.

[01:52:29.724 --> 01:52:30.324]  Long day.
[01:53:05.565 --> 01:53:24.939]  On a lonely, lonesome highway in the east of Omaha I listen to the engine moaning out his worn-out song I think about the woman, the girl you knew the night before
[01:53:31.161 --> 01:53:35.985]  But your powers will soon be wandering, the way they always do.
[01:53:36.185 --> 01:53:42.550]  When you're riding 16 hours, there's nothing much to do.
[01:53:42.710 --> 01:53:50.236]  And you don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through.
[01:53:57.650 --> 01:54:03.857]  Here I am, on the road again.
[01:54:03.917 --> 01:54:09.905]  Here I am, upon the trees.
[01:54:10.005 --> 01:54:14.871]  Here I go, being star again.
[01:54:25.762 --> 01:54:26.291]  We what?
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:16.421]  Glad you joined us.
[01:55:17.201 --> 01:55:21.123]  We're going to start the next hour, wide open phones, tons of news.
[01:55:21.143 --> 01:55:24.085]  We're also going to have Jason Burmess riding shotgun with us.
[01:55:25.745 --> 01:55:31.607]  To give us his take on massive attacks from a hundred different angles on the internet.
[01:55:31.647 --> 01:55:38.708]  And even if you don't use the internet, that 35% of the public in the US that don't or Canada, this does affect you and the information you receive.
[01:55:38.728 --> 01:55:39.949]  It's very, very important.
[01:55:40.489 --> 01:55:43.129]  That is coming up amongst a lot of other important news.
[01:55:43.290 --> 01:55:49.211]  Also vaccines and even USA Today admitting that autism has now exploded way past 1 in 168.
[01:55:49.251 --> 01:55:50.231]  They play a little trick though.
[01:55:53.590 --> 01:55:57.294]  They say, oh, more than 1 in 150.
[01:55:57.895 --> 01:56:02.741]  As we told you, preliminary numbers that were coming out last year said now about 1 in 80.
[01:56:03.942 --> 01:56:06.305]  And then they said they weren't sure the numbers would soon come out.
[01:56:06.325 --> 01:56:07.927]  I haven't been able to find the actual numbers.
[01:56:08.067 --> 01:56:10.190]  USA Today says more than 1 in 150.
[01:56:11.531 --> 01:56:12.452]  So that's coming up too.
[01:56:12.492 --> 01:56:13.614]  Before we end this hour,
[01:56:15.111 --> 01:56:25.892]  I do want to take a minute out to tell you that your purchase of the documentary films and books that we carry and that I've made at InfoWars.com is what makes this broadcast possible.
[01:56:27.154 --> 01:56:28.995]  But that's not the main reason you need to get them.
[01:56:29.055 --> 01:56:41.138]  The main reason is they're powerful, it's the best stuff, the best books, the best videos I've seen or read, and my 15 films, from Terror Storm to Loose Change 2nd Edition to America Freedom to Fascism, huge discounts on all of them.
[01:56:41.578 --> 01:56:47.280]  In some cases upwards of 75% off, a lot of them half off, $9.95 for Terror Storm,
[01:56:48.448 --> 01:56:49.829]  It's just there's a lot of great deals.

[01:57:05.279 --> 01:57:06.339]  Attack the enemy!

[01:57:47.978 --> 01:57:48.638]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.298 --> 01:57:50.339]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.059 --> 01:57:52.179]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.819 --> 01:57:53.639]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.399 --> 01:57:55.300]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:59.881]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.141 --> 01:58:04.262]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:04.882 --> 01:58:07.362]  Accelerating to attack speed!
[01:58:08.123 --> 01:58:09.643]  This is the Info War!
[01:58:11.667 --> 01:58:22.079]  The flack's getting darker and more intense in front of us as every major magazine and newspaper attacks the 9-11 Truth Movement and myself in many cases by name.
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:26.445]  Huge BBC attack piece coming out Sunday.
[01:58:26.485 --> 01:58:28.287]  They've declared to me it's an attack piece.
[01:58:28.907 --> 01:58:35.454]  I say good, it means I'm engaging their capital ships, I'm engaging their main fraud centers, their main power plants.
[01:58:35.574 --> 01:58:36.995]  Intensify the attack!
[01:58:37.335 --> 01:58:38.036]  We're winning!
[01:58:38.456 --> 01:58:41.439]  The Republic is rising out of the ashes!
[01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:47.245]  Let's go back to your calls, then Jason Burmess joins us, some loose change fame, and some key issues.
[01:58:47.805 --> 01:58:51.729]  Let's go ahead, I always like it when they call up and say, hey, we want to come on and talk about this.
[01:58:53.590 --> 01:58:55.731]  Place here on the floor anytime you want on.
[01:58:56.592 --> 01:58:58.933]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:59:00.094 --> 01:59:03.756]  Steve in Canada.
[01:59:04.317 --> 01:59:05.297]  The beautiful North.
[01:59:05.337 --> 01:59:05.678]  What's up?
[01:59:06.198 --> 01:59:07.299]  Good to speak with you Alex.
[01:59:07.579 --> 01:59:13.102]  I just had a comment about the release and FOIA request for the North American Forum.
[01:59:13.803 --> 01:59:14.143]  Yes.
[01:59:14.163 --> 01:59:16.104]  In September of last year in Banff, Alberta.
[01:59:16.764 --> 01:59:18.265]  Going through some of the documents that were released.
[01:59:18.325 --> 01:59:22.368]  I think there's about six documents that you can get from the Judicial Watch website.
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:26.321]  Yeah, and I noticed they had more up there, and now some aren't there.
[01:59:26.341 --> 01:59:29.563]  And I need to get Larry Klayman on, too, the former founder.
[01:59:29.583 --> 01:59:33.045]  He's been talking about, quote, the destruction of Judicial Watch, but go ahead.
[01:59:33.405 --> 01:59:43.249]  Well, yeah, there's one document in particular that I just, uh, there's one part that caught my attention, and this is, uh, titled, The Vision of North America, Issues and Proposals for Discussion.
[01:59:43.309 --> 01:59:43.970]  Well, stop there!
[01:59:44.050 --> 01:59:44.410]  Stop there!
[01:59:44.490 --> 01:59:45.870]  I'm, again, I'll give you all the time you need.
[01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:47.491]  We need to preface this.
[01:59:48.792 --> 01:59:51.313]  In September of last year, they had this North American summit,
[01:59:52.060 --> 02:00:05.151]  They had the heads of the governments, all these corporate chiefs, the first agenda is keeping everything secret, how to get a North American Union through, and there was a FOIA request, a lot of it got released, some of it didn't from the Justice Department, now go ahead.
[02:00:05.991 --> 02:00:10.375]  And this one document in particular by our friend Robert Pastor had offered this.
[02:00:10.915 --> 02:00:20.403]  There's a section in here that talks about the development gap, and quoting from this document it says, as long as US and Canadian per capita incomes
[02:00:20.842 --> 02:00:23.364]  are six to ten times larger than Mexico's.
[02:00:24.024 --> 02:00:27.787]  The prospect of having a genuine partnership remains remote.
[02:00:28.548 --> 02:00:34.432]  Narrowing the gap in income may be the single most important issue on the North American agenda.
[02:00:34.612 --> 02:00:36.093]  That means lower our income.
[02:00:36.313 --> 02:00:36.874]  Exactly.
[02:00:37.114 --> 02:00:39.596]  That's what I'm speculating in it.
[02:00:39.836 --> 02:00:40.917]  I think it's pretty reasonable.
[02:00:40.957 --> 02:00:45.260]  Well, that's the shaded bubble's plan is to lower the West's income.
[02:00:45.796 --> 02:00:53.843]  So we got this guy, Robert Pastures, coming into our country and he's talking about how do we lower the incomes of the middle class in North America.
[02:00:54.404 --> 02:00:55.084]  And who's he?
[02:00:55.164 --> 02:00:59.648]  Well, he's a CFR board chairman and he's writing up the policy for our governments.
[02:00:59.768 --> 02:01:01.510]  Well, I don't want this guy around anymore.
[02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:02.831]  This is ridiculous.
[02:01:03.752 --> 02:01:05.033]  Why not let him rule you?
[02:01:05.413 --> 02:01:05.854]  Exactly.
[02:01:05.914 --> 02:01:07.375]  What's wrong with having a ruler?
[02:01:08.676 --> 02:01:09.197]  Unbelievable.
[02:01:09.938 --> 02:01:11.439]  No accountability, that's my issue.
[02:01:11.459 --> 02:01:12.219]  What happened to government?
[02:01:12.519 --> 02:01:16.741]  Did you read the parts in there where they talk about how they've got to keep it secret from the public?
[02:01:16.781 --> 02:01:18.961]  I mean, this is secret conspiring!
[02:01:19.402 --> 02:01:23.183]  And you hear him smirking when Lou Dobbs was interviewing him a couple of days ago?
[02:01:23.983 --> 02:01:25.424]  Lou, don't you go to conferences?
[02:01:26.924 --> 02:01:28.725]  Don't you go to secret conferences?
[02:01:28.885 --> 02:01:31.026]  That burns my backside when I see stuff like that.
[02:01:31.926 --> 02:01:34.147]  Anyway, that's all I wanted to bring up on that issue.
[02:01:34.167 --> 02:01:39.029]  Just quickly, have you noticed the 9-11 Truth Movement appears to be reaching a tipping point?
[02:01:40.741 --> 02:01:51.157]  We have the latest article that came out in the ThisIsLondon.co.uk which was picked up I think by a
[02:01:52.031 --> 02:01:54.351]  A few mainstream sources in the UK?
[02:01:54.832 --> 02:02:04.194]  Oh yeah, no, the Mail on Sunday wrote a lavish article basically saying 9-11 is an inside job, worshipping loose change second edition.
[02:02:04.734 --> 02:02:12.255]  I mean, it's the most positive mainstream article I've ever seen, and I mean, we got 84% of the public thinking they're being lied to.
[02:02:12.475 --> 02:02:14.036]  Look, we've won the hearts and minds.
[02:02:14.496 --> 02:02:20.997]  You've got a few delusional people out there that still don't get it, and no, I agree, we have reached a flashpoint.
[02:02:22.173 --> 02:02:27.618]  We've hit the Fahrenheit point at which the truth movement just explodes.
[02:02:28.479 --> 02:02:32.683]  And they overplayed their hand, my friend.
[02:02:32.723 --> 02:02:33.804]  The globalists went too far.
[02:02:34.245 --> 02:02:35.566]  And it's a beautiful thing to watch.
[02:02:46.619 --> 02:02:52.086]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:52.447 --> 02:03:00.077]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:00.774 --> 02:03:17.147]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were chemicals that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:17.467 --> 02:03:20.930]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:23.352]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:23.692 --> 02:03:27.535]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:40.652 --> 02:03:45.735]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:45.795 --> 02:03:53.098]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:03:53.258 --> 02:04:03.864]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:04:04.084 --> 02:04:08.626]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:08.906 --> 02:04:13.911]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:04:14.112 --> 02:04:17.055]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:17.275 --> 02:04:27.105]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:04:41.507 --> 02:04:44.669]  Imagine, a firefly, simple and innocent.
[02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:47.451]  The ability to light the night sky.
[02:04:47.991 --> 02:04:52.413]  The ozone layer, unseen by the naked eye, life-sustaining.
[02:04:53.134 --> 02:04:56.095]  Our ocean, primordial soup, breathes life.
[02:04:56.756 --> 02:04:58.737]  Bring the wonders of nature home.
[02:04:59.357 --> 02:05:07.322]  Soleil salt lamps, handcrafted from million-year-old crystal salt, will gently ionize and purify your indoor air, helping you breathe easier.
[02:05:08.022 --> 02:05:15.673]  Nourish your mind and body with soothing colors for deep relaxation and neutralize EMF radiation protecting your family's health.
[02:05:16.445 --> 02:05:17.345]  We're good to go.
[02:05:50.572 --> 02:06:10.207]  Strange days have found us Strange days have shut us down They're come to destroy Crashing with joy
[02:06:35.743 --> 02:06:36.503]  Welcome back.
[02:06:37.543 --> 02:06:39.184]  Strange days have found us.
[02:06:39.244 --> 02:06:41.464]  Strange days have tracked us down.
[02:06:44.605 --> 02:06:47.006]  They're going to destroy
[02:06:50.388 --> 02:06:51.069]  Welcome back.
[02:06:51.089 --> 02:06:55.634]  Alright, I know we've got Patrick and many others holding.
[02:06:55.694 --> 02:06:59.437]  I'm told to remember to join us.
[02:06:59.458 --> 02:06:59.738]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:07:01.319 --> 02:07:03.241]  And Jason Burmiss joins us.
[02:07:03.682 --> 02:07:08.186]  I usually have to drag them on the show because they're so busy, but I'm always excited when they want to come on.
[02:07:08.507 --> 02:07:12.511]  Jason Burmiss, Corey Rowe, of course, the one and only, the indomitable Dylan Avery.
[02:07:14.363 --> 02:07:20.825]  Yes, their great construction, their great work of love has caused great problems for the New World Order.
[02:07:21.886 --> 02:07:28.308]  We're not talking about 9-11 inside job right now, though when we go to your calls you can talk about any issue you wish under the sun.
[02:07:28.328 --> 02:07:30.949]  Jason will be with us for the next 50 minutes.
[02:07:31.884 --> 02:07:39.327]  One minute that we have left in transmission time here on this Tuesday edition, the 13th day of February 2007.
[02:07:39.367 --> 02:07:44.909]  The website is LooseChange911.com.
[02:07:44.929 --> 02:07:48.890]  My websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com.
[02:07:50.451 --> 02:07:55.893]  And yes, I did see this story a few days ago and I did mention it on the Sunday radio show and never had time to get to it.
[02:07:55.913 --> 02:07:57.793]  It was syndicated shows 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:07:57.833 --> 02:07:58.894]  Central, now on
[02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:02.522]  on Genesis in association with MS Communications.
[02:08:02.882 --> 02:08:06.805]  They're putting on a lot of their big juggernaut 50,000 watt AM stations.
[02:08:07.786 --> 02:08:14.851]  And sure enough, two weeks ago, I mentioned on air, I said, yes, we've got a new affiliate in Norfolk covering at least four states.
[02:08:15.171 --> 02:08:16.092]  It's 50,000 watts.
[02:08:16.132 --> 02:08:17.493]  It's a clear channel station.
[02:08:19.054 --> 02:08:21.395]  And I got a bunch of emails saying, you traitor!
[02:08:21.435 --> 02:08:22.896]  You're on clear channel!
[02:08:24.037 --> 02:08:26.239]  When I announced that, I was clear.
[02:08:28.067 --> 02:08:31.048]  Clear Channel takes its name, now Carlisle Group owned.
[02:08:32.148 --> 02:08:35.549]  Clear Channel takes its name from Clear Channel Stations.
[02:08:36.349 --> 02:08:48.312]  A Clear Channel is a day and night, full power, highest power, licensed, I know program directors out there are laughing because they all know this, it is the holy grail of AM radio.
[02:08:48.832 --> 02:08:49.893]  It's a Clear Channel.
[02:08:50.213 --> 02:08:54.734]  W-O-A-I, K-F-I, K-O-A, W-A-B-C.
[02:08:55.968 --> 02:08:58.330]  It's 50,000 watts day and night.
[02:08:59.130 --> 02:09:01.591]  And at night, you can hear them on other continents.
[02:09:02.932 --> 02:09:07.735]  But I announced I'm on a Clear Channel AM, owned by Ennis.
[02:09:08.596 --> 02:09:11.237]  And now, absolute proof, I'm on Clear Channel Communications.
[02:09:11.638 --> 02:09:12.018]  No!
[02:09:13.676 --> 02:09:15.777]  And I hate to spend time on this type of issue.
[02:09:16.397 --> 02:09:18.097]  Frankly, I'd love to be on Clear Channel Station.
[02:09:18.117 --> 02:09:21.439]  So they came to me and said, say whatever you want, do whatever you want, we'll put you on Clear Channel.
[02:09:21.539 --> 02:09:21.919]  Fine!
[02:09:22.239 --> 02:09:22.839]  Reach the people.
[02:09:22.879 --> 02:09:24.700]  That hasn't happened, isn't going to happen.
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:27.961]  But the point is, is that, no, I'm digressing.
[02:09:27.981 --> 02:09:29.081]  We're getting a lot of new affiliates.
[02:09:29.141 --> 02:09:30.541]  I don't know how I got off into all that.
[02:09:31.322 --> 02:09:32.322]  But with the new media,
[02:09:33.268 --> 02:09:36.789]  There's a whole cocktail of ways they're trying to shut down and restrict the web.
[02:09:36.809 --> 02:09:39.310]  I'm going to try to calmly go through those with you today.
[02:09:39.650 --> 02:09:42.571]  But I want to get Jason Burmiss' take on this.
[02:09:42.611 --> 02:09:43.311]  Here's a headline.
[02:09:43.331 --> 02:09:44.772]  This is IT News.
[02:09:46.472 --> 02:09:48.473]  Online TV pushing the point.
[02:09:49.993 --> 02:09:59.436]  Self-made movies, YouTube clips, evil 9-11 videos have got the web to its breaking point with more than half the traffic or half the bandwidth used on the web being video.
[02:10:01.031 --> 02:10:04.813]  I told you six years ago what the plan was with this, and it isn't because I have a crystal ball.
[02:10:05.293 --> 02:10:07.314]  Internet 2 announced what the plan was.
[02:10:07.354 --> 02:10:08.135]  This is all staged.
[02:10:08.375 --> 02:10:16.759]  But to give us his take on it is, I can't say I have a favorite, but if I did, he's my favorite of the trio up there, Jason Burmiss.
[02:10:17.239 --> 02:10:27.645]  Jason, always good to have you with us, and he is the main host on the Louder Than Words radio program on Saturday here on the Genesis Communications radio network.
[02:10:28.065 --> 02:10:29.866]  Jason, good to have you on with me today, my friend.
[02:10:30.367 --> 02:10:31.548]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:10:31.728 --> 02:10:42.275]  And when I read this, I caught this yesterday morning, right before Corey and Dylan and I were actually going to the State University of New York in Oneona to speak in front of a Media 100 class about the new media.
[02:10:42.655 --> 02:10:47.618]  And what really upset me is it really attacked all the ways that we've been able to reach the people.
[02:10:47.899 --> 02:10:56.945]  I mean, as soon as Google buys YouTube, the other outlet for people like John Connor, yourself, ourself, to get this information out to people, they're saying, oh, well, the bandwidth is bad.
[02:10:56.965 --> 02:10:59.086]  And then they actually have the nerve to cite our movie.
[02:10:59.753 --> 02:11:04.176]  Saying, oh, they've been connected to 100 million hits, you know, we're never going to be able to create this bandwidth.
[02:11:04.236 --> 02:11:08.558]  And to use Patriot videos in order to restrict the Internet is absolutely ridiculous.
[02:11:08.658 --> 02:11:13.321]  Well, I mean, the ADL and the European Union have openly said 9-11 films.
[02:11:14.162 --> 02:11:25.188]  And in this BBC documentary that I've been able to get snippets of from the producers, they talk about how I'm the evil leader, that's the Air Sunday, and how we are taking over and we're a cancer.
[02:11:25.689 --> 02:11:27.490]  Basically, it's the old order.
[02:11:28.391 --> 02:11:32.753]  Who's claiming they're the New World Order, trying to destroy and attempt to defeat them.
[02:11:32.773 --> 02:11:34.134]  I mean, what do we expect?
[02:11:34.174 --> 02:11:35.434]  But yeah, go over this.
[02:11:36.094 --> 02:11:50.821]  Well, the thing is that we've used these tools like MySpace, YouTube, Google Video, in order to get noticed to have to be, you know, interviewed by Time Magazine, USA Today, to be on CNN, to be on... You hit the cultural zeitgeist square in the middle.
[02:11:51.733 --> 02:11:52.153]  Exactly.
[02:11:52.414 --> 02:11:53.774]  And it forces them to cover us.
[02:11:53.794 --> 02:11:55.616]  So now they want to restrict our means.
[02:11:56.096 --> 02:11:57.857]  And I stated this in front of the class.
[02:11:58.217 --> 02:11:59.518]  Look at the power of the media.
[02:11:59.558 --> 02:12:03.060]  They're covering us now basically because YouTube is such a phenomenon.
[02:12:03.101 --> 02:12:03.781]  They have to.
[02:12:04.321 --> 02:12:04.762]  They have to.
[02:12:04.782 --> 02:12:06.423]  By the way, where does this 100 million view?
[02:12:06.463 --> 02:12:09.565]  Because you guys five months ago were still saying 30 million.
[02:12:09.605 --> 02:12:14.208]  I said, no, it's got to be way more than that because they knocked out all your numbers like they did me repeatedly.
[02:12:14.908 --> 02:12:17.129]  You know, so, Google, I've got 7 million.
[02:12:17.149 --> 02:12:18.149]  I mean, what, you guys, 50, 60?
[02:12:18.269 --> 02:12:19.769]  Is it 100 million?
[02:12:19.949 --> 02:12:21.190]  Who knows?
[02:12:21.250 --> 02:12:27.011]  I mean, we know, though, it's got to be now 50 million on Google.
[02:12:27.111 --> 02:12:29.351]  I would say 100 million is conservative.
[02:12:29.852 --> 02:12:30.572]  It might be.
[02:12:30.612 --> 02:12:31.732]  I mean, we're number 12 today.
[02:12:31.912 --> 02:12:33.032]  No, we were number 12 yesterday.
[02:12:33.052 --> 02:12:34.053]  We're number 16 today.
[02:12:34.373 --> 02:12:40.274]  So, we've been up there for almost a year now, in the top 100 all the time, and in several different versions.
[02:12:40.314 --> 02:12:44.155]  I mean, the French version and the European version, especially with all the Guardian coverage,
[02:12:44.688 --> 02:12:46.210]  As of late, it's huge.
[02:13:01.229 --> 02:13:10.455]  Had to take note on John Connor's work, and his guerrilla tactics are successful because he's able to reach thousands of people a day right after he does something.
[02:13:10.495 --> 02:13:13.297]  And he's well-spoken, and he's six foot four and handsome.
[02:13:14.538 --> 02:13:15.158]  It doesn't hurt.
[02:13:15.178 --> 02:13:16.559]  It doesn't hurt, Alex.
[02:13:16.599 --> 02:13:20.021]  Those women were swooning over Genesis Talk Show host John Connor.
[02:13:20.982 --> 02:13:25.905]  And I love it because it shows that Genesis Communications is really at the forefront.
[02:13:26.426 --> 02:13:28.367]  I feel like we're forming like Voltron, Alex.
[02:13:28.752 --> 02:13:29.093]  We're good to go.
[02:13:41.587 --> 02:13:43.829]  Yeah, I think you are the head, Alex.
[02:13:43.869 --> 02:13:45.831]  You are the pioneer of all this.
[02:13:46.071 --> 02:13:48.473]  The head of Voltron, okay.
[02:13:48.493 --> 02:13:49.434]  Well, you have to be the head.
[02:13:49.454 --> 02:13:55.019]  I mean, before there was YouTube, before there was Google Video, there was Prison Planet and InfoWars.
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:14:00.204]  And you were the first person to start embedding, you know, real player videos and then Windows Media videos.
[02:14:00.504 --> 02:14:06.170]  And now we are able to, you know, reach massive amounts of people, you know, using YouTube and Google Video as a tool.
[02:14:06.670 --> 02:14:10.332]  For them to start saying, well, maybe we have to restrict that, and we're going to have to start charging for that.
[02:14:10.593 --> 02:14:12.174]  I like that Voltron!
[02:14:12.194 --> 02:14:25.482]  Yeah, and people can catch me on, you know, Saturday mornings, 10 to 12, me and Dylan do a weekly wrap-up show where we try to go over, you know, the week's events, you know, as much activism as we do.
[02:14:25.782 --> 02:14:34.908]  We actually were down in Albany this week, where there's a 9-11 truth group that's actually funded by the college, and the assistant dean said that they were the actual example
[02:14:35.448 --> 02:14:38.610]  Well, I don't like being the head of Voltron because the enemy will shoot his laser beams at me.
[02:14:58.206 --> 02:14:58.927]  You're the head!
[02:14:59.007 --> 02:14:59.688]  He's the head!
[02:14:59.808 --> 02:15:00.328]  Get him!
[02:15:00.408 --> 02:15:01.749]  Destroy Voltron!
[02:15:01.970 --> 02:15:08.256]  Well, regardless of what part of the body they knocked off, there's a bunch of us and we can just go our separate ways and do our own things.
[02:15:08.296 --> 02:15:09.717]  And that's, again, why we're successful.
[02:15:09.757 --> 02:15:13.440]  I mean, again, John Connor, not everybody is going to agree with everything he has to say.
[02:15:13.581 --> 02:15:14.141]  I don't, you know.
[02:15:14.181 --> 02:15:15.122]  I'm a good friend of John.
[02:15:15.162 --> 02:15:15.923]  I call him all the time.
[02:15:15.943 --> 02:15:16.303]  We talk.
[02:15:16.503 --> 02:15:19.646]  But it is the lone wolf, wolf pack strategy.
[02:15:19.686 --> 02:15:20.467]  There's too many of us.
[02:15:20.507 --> 02:15:21.168]  They can't stop us.
[02:15:21.768 --> 02:15:22.308]  Exactly.
[02:15:22.348 --> 02:15:34.011]  And then you have, you know, people like Webster Tarpley, who you had on yesterday, that continues to do radio programs, report on these, you know, false flag operations, the war games that are continuing to take place throughout the country.
[02:15:34.051 --> 02:15:35.952]  People should really be hip to that.
[02:15:35.992 --> 02:15:42.114]  I mean, they continue to drill, putting us into camps, they continue to drill bio-terror warfare exercises.
[02:15:42.474 --> 02:15:43.574]  It's all over the TV.
[02:15:43.994 --> 02:15:47.235]  We really need to continue to be aware and we need to expand our audience.
[02:15:47.739 --> 02:15:50.709]  And that's what's great about this is you can give a link to anybody.
[02:15:50.729 --> 02:15:53.017]  You can give a link to Alex's show to anybody.
[02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:56.022]  And they can pick it up, and it's on the internet.
[02:15:56.042 --> 02:15:56.662]  You can listen to it.
[02:15:56.762 --> 02:15:59.064]  You listeners are part of Voltron.
[02:15:59.384 --> 02:15:59.884]  That's right.
[02:16:00.325 --> 02:16:05.208]  Without the listeners and the Info Warriors, we wouldn't have people confronting Jesse Jackson.
[02:16:05.568 --> 02:16:11.272]  Most people, though, haven't watched Japanese TV from 20 years ago, so they think we're totally nuts.
[02:16:11.593 --> 02:16:12.473]  It's a joke, folks.
[02:16:12.553 --> 02:16:13.374]  It's an analogy.
[02:16:13.674 --> 02:16:15.095]  But explain what Voltron is.
[02:16:15.695 --> 02:16:23.341]  Basically, Voltron was this robot which was formed by different members of Voltron that were different parts of the robot, and at the end,
[02:16:23.741 --> 02:16:26.522]  They would form into one mega-robot to defeat evil.
[02:16:27.963 --> 02:16:30.844]  Yeah, and weren't they like lions or something?
[02:16:31.384 --> 02:16:33.405]  It was some kind of a lion thing, but not really.
[02:16:33.425 --> 02:16:35.685]  You know, it's one of those crazy... No, I mean, the sub-parts were.
[02:16:35.745 --> 02:16:36.806]  The sub-parts were, yeah.
[02:16:36.866 --> 02:16:38.286]  Yeah, well, they were animals, I think.
[02:16:38.526 --> 02:16:41.928]  I think so, and then they have that lion head that the robot face comes out of.
[02:16:42.248 --> 02:16:43.948]  Kind of like Transformers, but not really.
[02:16:44.008 --> 02:16:46.589]  I have to admit, 25 years ago I watched Voltron.
[02:16:46.889 --> 02:16:48.270]  I'd forgotten about Voltron.
[02:16:49.624 --> 02:16:50.625]  He had that big sword.
[02:16:50.645 --> 02:16:52.008]  Absolutely.
[02:16:52.088 --> 02:16:52.749]  A huge sword.
[02:16:52.930 --> 02:16:54.573]  He cut those big goblins in half.
[02:16:56.497 --> 02:16:59.598]  He was a good guy, Alex, and we're trying to do good on this.
[02:16:59.818 --> 02:17:01.419]  Hey, let's give folks some info.
[02:17:02.079 --> 02:17:06.560]  Specifically on the article attacking the evil 9-11 Truth movement for taking over the web.
[02:17:06.580 --> 02:17:08.701]  They're now spamming in the name.
[02:17:08.981 --> 02:17:12.662]  Private companies are spamming a 9-11 Truth's name, selling Viagra.
[02:17:12.682 --> 02:17:13.922]  I mean, that's how big it's gotten.
[02:17:14.502 --> 02:17:16.023]  And we'll break it down.
[02:17:16.563 --> 02:17:18.403]  We'll talk about what their basic plan is.
[02:17:18.883 --> 02:17:20.604]  Here's some Jimmy Vaughn, my good friend.
[02:17:20.624 --> 02:17:21.384]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:25.982 --> 02:17:27.126]  We're good to go.
[02:17:40.197 --> 02:17:43.218]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:17:43.518 --> 02:17:48.461]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:17:48.701 --> 02:17:53.062]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:17:53.363 --> 02:18:02.266]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:18:02.486 --> 02:18:06.088]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:18:06.388 --> 02:18:11.412]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:18:11.712 --> 02:18:18.398]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:18:18.931 --> 02:18:19.572]  What about you?
[02:18:20.233 --> 02:18:25.579]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:19:43.641 --> 02:19:52.886]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[02:19:53.807 --> 02:20:00.611]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[02:20:01.511 --> 02:20:02.952]  Is this what Americans want?
[02:20:03.172 --> 02:20:06.234]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?

[02:20:40.161 --> 02:20:46.189]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:20:46.730 --> 02:20:47.551]  Globalists are conservative.
[02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:55.540]  We're good.

[02:21:47.877 --> 02:21:52.260]  We first have to believe in ourselves with God's help, and then put the idea into action.
[02:22:12.848 --> 02:22:18.092]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:18.172 --> 02:22:22.836]  Jason Burmas, part of the trio that produced Loose Change 2nd Edition, joins us.
[02:22:22.876 --> 02:22:26.979]  He is a Genesis host, and we are honored to have him here with us today.
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:29.221]  Just some background.
[02:22:29.741 --> 02:22:33.204]  About five, six years ago, I learned about Internet 2.0.
[02:22:33.264 --> 02:22:41.751]  I was sent an email, and the headline was in, I believe, The Guardian, even back then, and it was in several other tech publications, The Internet is Dead.
[02:22:42.634 --> 02:22:43.734]  And that's a mantra.
[02:22:43.754 --> 02:22:54.577]  You type that in, you'll probably find fifteen, twenty articles that are written at Internet2 meetings here in Austin, London, Chicago, Berlin, Tokyo.
[02:22:55.077 --> 02:22:55.937]  They've had them everywhere.
[02:22:57.437 --> 02:23:03.259]  And they have them every year, and it's now over fifty universities and another fifty major corporations.
[02:23:03.299 --> 02:23:04.939]  And let me just explain it in layman's terms.
[02:23:05.859 --> 02:23:08.400]  There'll only be a hundred or so websites
[02:23:09.275 --> 02:23:10.816]  The old internet will be shut down.
[02:23:10.956 --> 02:23:12.216]  You won't be able to get to anything on it.
[02:23:12.597 --> 02:23:13.697]  You think I'm joking, folks?
[02:23:14.838 --> 02:23:22.561]  And just like when you sign on to MySpace, you sign a contract saying you don't own your own work, they can shut you down whenever they want, they can censor you with keyword data.
[02:23:24.302 --> 02:23:32.666]  They stated that you will have to have a subdomain, say University of Texas slash InfoWars dot org or dot edu.
[02:23:34.742 --> 02:23:38.924]  And they said that, well, the Internet's going to die because there'll be all this video on it.
[02:23:38.944 --> 02:23:40.145]  This is five, six years ago.
[02:23:40.165 --> 02:23:42.025]  This is about six now.
[02:23:42.065 --> 02:23:42.646]  It was in 2000.
[02:23:42.826 --> 02:23:43.506]  It's almost seven.
[02:23:44.186 --> 02:23:46.407]  And they said, and I've been talking about it every month since then.
[02:23:47.008 --> 02:23:49.669]  Most of you know about this, but for new listeners, there's a lot of you every day.
[02:23:52.110 --> 02:23:53.871]  Basically, it's like this.
[02:23:53.891 --> 02:23:56.392]  You've got existing highways, similar to the toll roads.
[02:23:57.341 --> 02:23:57.863]  On the Internet.
[02:23:58.084 --> 02:23:59.669]  And they're not going to upkeep those.
[02:23:59.769 --> 02:24:04.003]  They're not going to upgrade their hubs, 40-something hubs here in the U.S.
[02:24:04.063 --> 02:24:04.344]  alone.
[02:24:05.089 --> 02:24:15.753]  They're going to let that fail, and they're going to let corporations, to speed it up, have peer-to-peer wards, like two years ago, Cogent and Level 3, two big backbone companies in the U.S.
[02:24:15.773 --> 02:24:22.975]  had a fight, and what, over a third of the web, including my website, InfoWars.com, for about three weeks was inaccessible.
[02:24:23.055 --> 02:24:29.237]  It was up, and they were fighting with each other, saying they wouldn't accept each other's traffic over their backbones.
[02:24:30.698 --> 02:24:35.339]  And so the EU, ICANN, all of them have said they're going to just let that degenerate.
[02:24:36.179 --> 02:24:47.222]  Companies, they tried to get a law passed last year, over $150 million, the Associated Press reported, was spent by the telecommunications lobbying to allow them to shut off basically the entire web.
[02:24:48.182 --> 02:24:51.683]  Unless it was a telecommunications giant and you had an agreement
[02:24:52.933 --> 02:24:53.974]  We're good to go.
[02:25:07.868 --> 02:25:31.081]  Jason Bermas will elaborate more later, but before we end this segment, comment on that, because in this huge global article, an online TV pushing the web to breaking point, IT News, which a lot of ITs read, it attacks 9-11 videos and says Loose Change has over 100 million views, been up for a couple of years, Terror Storm already 7 million, we've had Google deleting our numbers to keep us out of the top 100, they admit that,
[02:25:32.042 --> 02:25:33.764]  Well yeah, I think there's a few different parts to this article.
[02:25:33.784 --> 02:25:34.685]  I mean, first of all,
[02:25:57.456 --> 02:26:06.007]  It's the head of TV technology at Google that's calling this out and it's right after their purchase of the only other game in town in the public's mind, YouTube.
[02:26:06.107 --> 02:26:09.391]  Because they're going to be available making the agreements and everybody else won't.
[02:26:10.283 --> 02:26:10.723]  Exactly.
[02:26:10.763 --> 02:26:14.765]  So they're kind of pushing themselves as the only guys around anyway now.
[02:26:14.945 --> 02:26:16.466]  And they have a conflict of interest.
[02:26:16.486 --> 02:26:18.987]  They have a conflict of interest to even be saying that.
[02:26:19.087 --> 02:26:19.547]  Exactly.
[02:26:19.667 --> 02:26:20.368]  Absolutely.
[02:26:20.488 --> 02:26:25.410]  And then they say, well, you know, our viewers are going to need better content, so we're going to have to find a whole new way.
[02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:28.111]  And it's also a way to get people into a new control grid.
[02:26:28.871 --> 02:26:33.833]  If you want to watch online video, you're going to have to have a credit card or a bank account.
[02:26:35.530 --> 02:26:40.874]  And it's going to be immediate, basically, of, you know, you purchasing them, and it gets you into that other grid.
[02:26:40.914 --> 02:26:41.914]  And again... Now, let's be clear.
[02:26:41.934 --> 02:26:46.037]  They're going to make you pay to get access to free videos.
[02:26:46.357 --> 02:26:48.178]  They're saying they want to.
[02:26:48.599 --> 02:26:50.800]  The government is saying this.
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:56.143]  And then they put out this fraud that, well, everybody's streaming their stuff for free.
[02:26:56.203 --> 02:26:57.925]  No, you pay with your internet connection.
[02:26:58.485 --> 02:27:01.147]  Any company that's streaming it is paying for it with advertising.
[02:27:02.447 --> 02:27:04.609]  This has been a boon to telecommunications.
[02:27:05.467 --> 02:27:06.128]  Exactly.
[02:27:06.208 --> 02:27:08.429]  And I just want to point out they're not the only game in town.
[02:27:08.930 --> 02:27:13.533]  DivX has a great site, stage6.divx.com, where you can put up high-quality DVD video for free.
[02:27:15.014 --> 02:27:15.434]  Stay there.
[02:27:15.475 --> 02:27:18.837]  Let's plug alternative places and hit some of the other facets, Jason Burmess.
[02:27:19.137 --> 02:27:21.399]  Give you a chance to run with this and give us your view on it.
[02:27:21.819 --> 02:27:23.500]  But that's only part of the equation.
[02:27:23.841 --> 02:27:25.222]  Then there's the hate crimes laws.
[02:27:25.722 --> 02:27:29.585]  Then there's making bloggers register as lobbyists.
[02:27:30.626 --> 02:27:31.566]  We're on the march.
[02:27:32.007 --> 02:27:33.528]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:34.506 --> 02:27:37.287]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:40.967 --> 02:27:43.308]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:27:43.548 --> 02:27:45.588]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:27:45.728 --> 02:27:52.790]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:27:53.050 --> 02:28:01.652]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:28:01.732 --> 02:28:01.932]  Yes!
[02:28:01.952 --> 02:28:06.636]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:39.022]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:28:40.843 --> 02:28:42.624]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:28:42.704 --> 02:28:43.965]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:28:44.206 --> 02:28:47.008]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:28:47.388 --> 02:28:50.110]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:28:50.663 --> 02:28:57.407]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[02:28:57.968 --> 02:29:06.093]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at LibertyStickers.com.

[02:29:22.084 --> 02:29:24.286]  And express your freedom of speech today.
[02:29:24.306 --> 02:29:24.987]  Call 877-873-9626.
[02:29:25.007 --> 02:29:25.267]  That's 877-873-9626.
[02:29:39.938 --> 02:29:44.001]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:44.201 --> 02:29:47.604]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:47.784 --> 02:29:51.286]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:51.526 --> 02:29:54.729]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:29:55.009 --> 02:30:00.252]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[02:30:00.272 --> 02:30:09.917]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jogs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:30:10.038 --> 02:30:11.398]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:30:11.418 --> 02:30:16.881]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:30:17.342 --> 02:30:21.784]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:21.844 --> 02:30:23.125]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:23.373 --> 02:30:26.835]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:30:26.855 --> 02:30:27.836]  That toll free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[02:30:57.903 --> 02:30:59.544]  It is addictive.
[02:31:01.146 --> 02:31:05.430]  At your most primitive base level to fight corruption and stand up for the weak.
[02:31:06.571 --> 02:31:08.773]  It's better than anything on this planet.
[02:31:09.393 --> 02:31:11.675]  It's better than all the pleasures of the flesh.
[02:31:13.537 --> 02:31:14.638]  Being a good guy is fun.
[02:31:15.991 --> 02:31:16.773]  A lot of hard work.
[02:31:17.214 --> 02:31:19.159]  We're talking to a good guy right now, Jason Burmiss.
[02:31:19.520 --> 02:31:24.972]  Your calls, Patrick, Maggie, Bo, Steve, and many others, coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:31:26.318 --> 02:31:33.302]  Remember, they spent $150 million in the last legislative session of Congress to openly end net neutrality.
[02:31:33.522 --> 02:31:36.724]  And if one backbone of the 40-plus in the U.S.
[02:31:36.764 --> 02:31:41.086]  goes down, it shuts down large portions of the web.
[02:31:41.407 --> 02:31:47.610]  Two backbones fighting in 2005 shut down over a third of the web, over 36%.
[02:31:50.292 --> 02:31:54.454]  Just type in level 3 and cogent fight and it'll come up for you.
[02:31:56.267 --> 02:31:59.410]  And a third plus of our listeners could not find InfoWars.
[02:31:59.870 --> 02:32:02.212]  Hundreds of calls a day, you're down, you're down.
[02:32:02.872 --> 02:32:06.015]  And I said, no, go get another internet provider and see if we're up.
[02:32:06.135 --> 02:32:07.316]  Oh yeah, we're up, we're up.
[02:32:08.597 --> 02:32:17.844]  But on top of that, they want to make anyone who gets more than 500 hits, and a hit isn't a visitor, that'd be maybe a hundred or so visitors a year.
[02:32:18.945 --> 02:32:22.168]  A hit is just basically anything that's downloaded off your site, any images, anything.
[02:32:22.468 --> 02:32:24.409]  So one person going to your site might be 10, 15 hits.
[02:32:26.716 --> 02:32:32.980]  You'd have to register under federal law as a lobbyist and pay all the fines, pay to sign up for it.
[02:32:33.020 --> 02:32:33.960]  People can't afford that.
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:34.641]  They can't do it.
[02:32:35.701 --> 02:32:36.902]  And so they're trying all this.
[02:32:36.942 --> 02:32:50.169]  So the recording industry, everybody else, Google, YouTube, they're getting together trying to frustrate and saying they're going to shut down the old internet, the old conduits, block those off and make you go to internet too.
[02:32:50.510 --> 02:32:52.971]  And that's exactly what Google's coming out and saying.
[02:32:54.420 --> 02:33:01.971]  And they're blaming, they blame, they say all this download of video is going to cause this and it's these 9-11 truthers.
[02:33:03.874 --> 02:33:07.240]  They're the main ones and folks out of all the videos
[02:33:08.733 --> 02:33:12.514]  9-11 truth is a fraction, but they let us know their game.
[02:33:12.554 --> 02:33:13.655]  They say too much.
[02:33:14.355 --> 02:33:19.296]  They protest too much and show us one of the main things that's irritating them.
[02:33:19.736 --> 02:33:25.158]  But I tell you, Jason Bermans, I think it's too late for them because people have a hunger for the alternative now.
[02:33:25.498 --> 02:33:31.600]  They've tasted the truth, and once someone knows the truth's out there and you try to make it forbidden,
[02:33:32.529 --> 02:33:36.195]  I almost invite it, because I think it's going to blow up in their face.
[02:33:36.375 --> 02:33:40.160]  I don't think these old men realize that they've lost their monopoly of power.
[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:40.801]  Jason Burmess?
[02:33:44.992 --> 02:33:47.414]  Once they realize the restrictions placed on them on the Internet.
[02:33:47.774 --> 02:33:55.259]  And I think that's why it's important now to, you know, combat Google and Google Video and YouTube and use alternative sites like ifilm.com.
[02:33:55.279 --> 02:33:56.139]  You can post videos.
[02:33:56.399 --> 02:33:58.821]  And like I said, state6.divx.com.
[02:33:58.841 --> 02:34:00.542]  You can put up DVD quality videos.
[02:34:00.822 --> 02:34:06.526]  So maybe we should just go to them and give them our business because I'm sure they'll take the advertiser's money just like anybody else would.
[02:34:07.286 --> 02:34:13.452]  The key is never to fall into one word of advice or one company or one way of doing things.
[02:34:13.812 --> 02:34:16.534]  And when you submit that, then they can do whatever they want.
[02:34:16.574 --> 02:34:19.657]  They truly have monopolized the situation.
[02:34:20.037 --> 02:34:29.285]  They can try and do this, but as soon as there's bills or they're saying, well, you can only have this much and this much, a lot of people are going to get upset and find a different service.
[02:34:31.591 --> 02:34:33.152]  Everyone should diversify.
[02:34:33.172 --> 02:34:34.472]  That's important.
[02:34:34.892 --> 02:34:36.733]  What other attack patterns do you see?
[02:34:38.074 --> 02:34:39.234]  Ah, what other attack patterns?
[02:34:39.274 --> 02:34:45.437]  Well, I definitely see an increase in the chatter on these online posted mainstream articles.
[02:34:45.537 --> 02:34:54.240]  I mean, before they shut it down, the one calling us a virus, you know, loose change is a conspiracy virus that's hit the world and, you know, it's ruining everything.
[02:34:54.588 --> 02:34:58.410]  There were 476 printable pages in less than six days.
[02:34:58.770 --> 02:35:02.512]  So that means that there was basically a novel written about the subject back and forth.
[02:35:02.892 --> 02:35:05.253]  I think that's great, you know, that that debate is out there.
[02:35:05.634 --> 02:35:13.458]  But, like you said, you know there are those mockingbirds out there, CENTCOM, posting up all this nonsense, you know, this limited left hangout stuff.
[02:35:14.098 --> 02:35:24.163]  So, I mean, you know, when you see people like Chomsky on television saying, you know, it doesn't even matter if it's an inside job, you really have to turn your head and say, how can you even get, how can you even say that?
[02:35:24.540 --> 02:35:30.182]  I mean, our entire foreign and domestic policy is based on the government's version of 9-11, and it continues to be.
[02:35:30.442 --> 02:35:33.243]  And they continue to, you know, produce all this fear.
[02:35:33.283 --> 02:35:44.447]  I mean, I thought it was really funny when Boston had those Aqua Teen Hunger Force ads, and it was all over Fox News and NBC and MSNBC and CNN, and every single one was fear-mongering.
[02:35:44.727 --> 02:35:51.789]  And then as soon as they went to the press conference, and they confronted them on it and said, you know, Turner Networks is trying to apologize and saying that they were ads.
[02:35:52.270 --> 02:35:55.293]  The guy couldn't even own up to it, and he said, well, we're investigating that angle.
[02:35:55.573 --> 02:35:58.395]  And it wasn't until hours later that they really picked up on that story.
[02:36:00.217 --> 02:36:08.264]  They take the land of the free and the home of the brave, and turn police into creatures who are terrified of a glow-light creature.
[02:36:09.745 --> 02:36:17.012]  Absolutely, and you know, a great example of that is, we were down in New York City this weekend, you know, Luke from 9-11 Truth was down there in front of
[02:36:17.762 --> 02:36:19.144]  Ground Zero like he is every week.
[02:36:19.545 --> 02:36:26.294]  And we were watching some of the video of these guys just harassing them for having a sign with cardboard in it.
[02:36:26.334 --> 02:36:28.097]  I mean, Lucas looked into the regulations.
[02:36:28.397 --> 02:36:31.842]  He knows you can't have wood holding up a sign, and I think you can't have metal.
[02:36:32.103 --> 02:36:34.186]  So he hollowed out a couple pieces of cardboard.
[02:36:34.526 --> 02:36:43.950]  And still, you know, an officer in full SWAT team, bomb gear, full Kevlar, semi-automatic machine gun by his side, comes over to him and says he can't have that in there.
[02:36:44.250 --> 02:36:47.112]  If he wants to hold that sign, he's got to take those tubes out.
[02:36:47.352 --> 02:36:48.472]  They could be used as a weapon.
[02:36:48.753 --> 02:36:49.613]  I mean, it's ludicrous.
[02:36:50.974 --> 02:36:56.136]  While the state is standing there with Heckler & Koch 9mm machine guns.
[02:36:57.192 --> 02:37:06.376]  I mean, if you just take a look how militarized New York City has really become, and it's at Wall Street, it's in lower Manhattan at times, it's definitely a ground zero.
[02:37:06.416 --> 02:37:12.779]  Did you see the report of how they went from 900 and something thousand random stops and frisks to over 500,000?
[02:37:13.239 --> 02:37:15.280]  Well, that's what happens when you give people power, Alex.
[02:37:15.340 --> 02:37:25.264]  I mean, if you give people the power to search you, or you're not going to get, you know, on the subway, for instance, as we know they've done in the past, and continue to do, you know, people are going to submit.
[02:37:25.723 --> 02:37:28.385]  And if you give these people that power, they're going to do it.
[02:37:28.465 --> 02:37:29.666]  And you know they'll say.
[02:37:30.226 --> 02:37:30.426]  Sure.
[02:37:30.966 --> 02:37:33.428]  You have power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[02:37:33.448 --> 02:37:39.572]  So the more power these people have, the more, you know, search and seizure, independent of the Fourth Amendment, we're going to say.
[02:37:40.172 --> 02:37:42.874]  We know what's going to happen, and we know what's already happened.
[02:37:42.894 --> 02:37:44.475]  They've attempted to intimidate us.
[02:37:44.915 --> 02:37:46.596]  They've attempted to pull out all the stops.
[02:37:46.916 --> 02:37:47.757]  It's not working.
[02:37:47.857 --> 02:37:49.058]  We know they're the terrorists.
[02:37:49.698 --> 02:37:50.819]  We know who's behind 9-11.
[02:37:51.499 --> 02:37:52.920]  Where do you see this going in the future?
[02:37:53.740 --> 02:37:57.762]  Well, I honestly think that we're going to have to have a big showing at the primaries right now.
[02:37:57.802 --> 02:38:08.028]  That's probably my next main goal, is to have a huge showing of 9-11 Truth at the first primary, whether it be New Hampshire or California, if they're able to pass that, although I don't see them doing it.
[02:38:08.308 --> 02:38:18.654]  And if we can get a few thousand people out to that state in black t-shirts again, and really infiltrate the booths and make sure local and national media see us, I want that out there again.
[02:38:18.714 --> 02:38:22.156]  I want more than just Kucinich being confronted about 9-11 Truth.
[02:38:25.123 --> 02:38:26.443]  Let's go to some phone calls.
[02:38:26.883 --> 02:38:28.424]  Let's talk to Patrick in Florida.
[02:38:28.444 --> 02:38:29.084]  You're on the air.
[02:38:30.304 --> 02:38:31.064]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:38:31.084 --> 02:38:31.665]  Good, sir.
[02:38:32.525 --> 02:38:34.945]  I was calling, you were talking about Bank of America earlier.
[02:38:34.965 --> 02:38:38.506]  Yeah, how the illegal aliens don't have to show ID to get bank accounts.
[02:38:38.926 --> 02:38:42.907]  Back in the mainstream news today, that citizens are treated like slaves.
[02:38:43.487 --> 02:38:45.228]  Yeah, I'm a college student.
[02:38:45.268 --> 02:38:49.569]  I go to USF and I had to file the FAFSA form to get a loan to pay for my school.
[02:38:50.429 --> 02:38:52.309]  My first loan application was messed up.
[02:38:52.429 --> 02:38:53.410]  It said my income was $85,000.
[02:38:55.066 --> 02:38:55.366]  I don't know.
[02:39:16.673 --> 02:39:18.114]  So, you're not allowed to borrow anything else.
[02:39:18.495 --> 02:39:20.857]  It's social engineering.
[02:39:21.297 --> 02:39:24.100]  The illegal aliens are already where the New World Order wants them.
[02:39:24.140 --> 02:39:28.284]  Totally poor, destitute, so they're more than happy to loan to them.
[02:39:28.344 --> 02:39:30.967]  They don't want you getting into the middle class.
[02:39:31.327 --> 02:39:31.607]  Oh yeah.
[02:39:31.888 --> 02:39:33.349]  No, it's almost impossible.
[02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:36.752]  The only way out of middle class is to go through college.
[02:39:37.052 --> 02:39:39.615]  But if you do that, everyone who comes out is in debt.
[02:39:39.895 --> 02:39:41.717]  They all have these crazy interest rates.
[02:39:42.308 --> 02:39:46.516]  And they're just going to become working for the people that we're trying to fight here.
[02:39:47.317 --> 02:39:49.622]  And, like, the superhighway they're going to put in.
[02:39:49.702 --> 02:39:51.325]  Like, that's really going to help immigration.
[02:39:51.345 --> 02:39:52.507]  The border is a joke.
[02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:58.063]  You put a highway in, and you think we're going to stop them from coming in?
[02:39:58.564 --> 02:40:03.668]  Jason Burmas, how legitimate is the war on terror and domestic checkpoints with the U.S.
[02:40:03.828 --> 02:40:09.593]  Army in New York while our borders are wide open and illegal aliens don't have to show ID to get housing loans?
[02:40:09.953 --> 02:40:11.214]  It has zero legitimacy.
[02:40:11.234 --> 02:40:16.398]  The fact that our borders aren't the main issue, you know, if this terror threat was truly real,
[02:40:16.957 --> 02:40:17.738]  Is laughable.
[02:40:17.858 --> 02:40:26.846]  I mean, how easy would it be for, you know, one of these Al-Qaeda or Al-Cieda entities to go to South America, Mexico, and come up through the border?
[02:40:27.247 --> 02:40:27.967]  Very easy.
[02:40:28.448 --> 02:40:32.632]  And, you know, that's just one of the running jokes of, you know, this whole war on terror.
[02:40:32.912 --> 02:40:34.473]  And you really do see the illegals.
[02:40:34.513 --> 02:40:40.118]  I mean, even in upstate New York, where I am now, you know, at a Denny's where college kids used to work, you know, you have illegals.
[02:40:40.339 --> 02:40:41.740]  It's that blatant.
[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:42.661]  They don't even speak English.
[02:40:43.380 --> 02:40:44.641]  And I think that's a real problem.
[02:40:44.741 --> 02:40:46.983]  I mean, they're obviously trying to devastate the middle class.
[02:40:47.303 --> 02:40:52.267]  Lou Dobbs has really stepped up to the plate in the last year or so, and called these guys out on it.
[02:40:52.347 --> 02:40:55.050]  I just hope, you know, more people in the mainstream media follow.
[02:40:56.871 --> 02:40:57.412]  I agree.
[02:40:57.732 --> 02:40:59.113]  Anything else, Patrick?
[02:41:00.434 --> 02:41:01.195]  No, that's about it.
[02:41:01.255 --> 02:41:03.096]  It's just a war on the middle class.
[02:41:03.176 --> 02:41:06.999]  And I mean, my parents, they are so brainwashed.
[02:41:07.019 --> 02:41:11.163]  My mom, her family came here from Cuba to get rid of communism and oppression.
[02:41:11.816 --> 02:41:17.417]  And she sees everything we're doing, all these surveillance cameras on every street corner, being such a great thing to keep us safe.
[02:41:17.997 --> 02:41:19.798]  I want the freedom to get injured.
[02:41:19.838 --> 02:41:20.918]  I want the freedom to get killed.
[02:41:20.938 --> 02:41:22.658]  I don't need a camera looking at me.
[02:41:22.738 --> 02:41:26.059]  I don't need Big Mother making sure I don't scrape my knee on the corner.
[02:41:26.519 --> 02:41:28.360]  Yeah, they think tyranny is freedom.
[02:41:28.380 --> 02:41:29.160]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:32.480]  Maggie in Texas, you're on the air with Jason Burmus.
[02:41:32.500 --> 02:41:32.980]  Go ahead.
[02:41:34.421 --> 02:41:35.721]  Hello Alex and Jason.
[02:41:36.001 --> 02:41:38.982]  I'm a little off the subject, but I have just learned that that
[02:41:40.822 --> 02:41:53.670]  National reality show extreme makeover about the autistic family that's getting a house is going to be aired this coming Sunday over ABC.
[02:41:53.850 --> 02:41:57.073]  That's February 18th at 7 p.m.
[02:41:57.233 --> 02:41:59.854]  So that certainly will take the story national.
[02:42:00.475 --> 02:42:07.039]  Now at the time I called you about a month ago to tell you about this you said to send you some information which I did.
[02:42:07.059 --> 02:42:08.340]  I sent some
[02:42:09.085 --> 02:42:12.968]  Attachments and some web links to Kevin's email address.
[02:42:13.489 --> 02:42:27.160]  But I've found more since, including an article that appeared in 2004, in which the mother of that family actually admits that the two youngest kids were damaged by their vaccinations.
[02:42:27.341 --> 02:42:28.582]  I had never seen that before.
[02:42:28.642 --> 02:42:33.426]  Yeah, what happens is, on average, almost every family I talk to, but it's also in the medical research,
[02:42:34.068 --> 02:42:43.414]  When they get the third round of shots at a year and a half, at 18 months, the child has a convulsion in the hospital, at the clinic, in the car, or that night, and baby's gone.
[02:42:43.854 --> 02:42:45.215]  Baby's not bouncing a ball.
[02:42:45.295 --> 02:42:46.435]  Baby's not having fun.
[02:42:46.475 --> 02:42:48.997]  Baby's not running around underneath the sprinklers in the summer.
[02:42:49.637 --> 02:42:51.498]  Baby is worshipping the New World Order.
[02:42:52.259 --> 02:42:54.660]  And they do that by their brains frying.
[02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:55.941]  That's how you love the government.
[02:42:56.659 --> 02:42:59.780]  And I have it right here out of USA Today over the weekend.
[02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:01.901]  Autism estimates increased sharply.
[02:43:02.341 --> 02:43:04.702]  Findings could fuel debate over causes.
[02:43:05.302 --> 02:43:19.927]  The number of children who have an autism disorder, as many as one in every 150, is significantly higher than previously thought, according to a new federal report being billed as the most complete assessment to date.
[02:43:20.467 --> 02:43:23.508]  I have another one here out of the French news agency AFP.
[02:43:25.743 --> 02:43:30.365]  A flu vaccine went horribly wrong for a public servant who developed a potentially fatal condition.
[02:43:30.746 --> 02:43:34.328]  A Senate Estimates Committee heard today.
[02:43:34.768 --> 02:43:36.229]  And how many troops have I interviewed?
[02:43:36.469 --> 02:43:40.891]  How many fathers and mothers whose son takes the anthrax shot and dies of an autoimmune disease?
[02:43:41.172 --> 02:43:50.477]  The live cancer virus that the Texas governor claims everyone has to take by law is causing accelerated autoimmune death and illnesses, bleeding out, seizures.
[02:43:50.917 --> 02:43:52.098]  Jason Bermas comments.
[02:43:52.788 --> 02:43:58.531]  Well, actually, my brother works in a home with autistic adults and has for quite some time, so I have kind of like an inside view.
[02:43:58.891 --> 02:44:02.333]  And you can just see by, you know, hanging out with these people, they were normal people.
[02:44:02.393 --> 02:44:03.974]  They don't have Down syndrome.
[02:44:04.234 --> 02:44:05.755]  You know, something happened along the way.
[02:44:05.775 --> 02:44:11.258]  Yeah, now we have adult onset of it because of the mercury buildup, and mercury attacks the cerebral cortex.
[02:44:11.718 --> 02:44:17.481]  Absolutely, and these were kids that were normal up until, you know, 4, 5, 7, 8, depending.
[02:44:17.821 --> 02:44:21.483]  And all of a sudden, something goes wrong, and they're just so docile and slow.
[02:44:22.183 --> 02:44:26.084]  And, you know, to say that it's not, you know, the vaccinations... Well, let's be clear.
[02:44:26.444 --> 02:44:28.184]  I'm 33 years old now.
[02:44:29.024 --> 02:44:29.784]  I'm 33.
[02:44:30.285 --> 02:44:33.425]  When I was in school, you might see one autistic person.
[02:44:33.485 --> 02:44:37.266]  Now, they have whole rooms at every school filled with these poor children.
[02:44:37.566 --> 02:44:39.626]  You go on the hike and bike trail, you go to the mall.
[02:44:39.906 --> 02:44:40.726]  They're everywhere!
[02:44:41.086 --> 02:44:43.107]  I mean, it's not over-reporting, folks.
[02:44:43.267 --> 02:44:45.147]  I mean, the extremely autistic children.
[02:44:45.187 --> 02:44:45.487]  Jason?
[02:44:45.927 --> 02:44:47.128]  Yeah, it's not over-reporting.
[02:44:47.148 --> 02:44:49.288]  There's no shortage of homes for my brother to work in.
[02:44:49.833 --> 02:44:52.895]  You know, he works all over the upstate New York area, you know, in homes.
[02:44:53.055 --> 02:44:54.675]  It'll get down to one in three.
[02:44:54.736 --> 02:44:55.676]  That's how they want us.
[02:44:56.396 --> 02:44:58.918]  And they're reporting less than 150.
[02:44:59.258 --> 02:45:04.240]  I mean, how much crazier does it have to get when it was, you know, one in thousands, you know, in the 40s?
[02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:05.521]  In fact, that's it.
[02:45:05.561 --> 02:45:06.662]  I play it every few months.
[02:45:06.682 --> 02:45:08.322]  Get the Mercury's Good for You clip, please.
[02:45:08.342 --> 02:45:10.203]  That's a great clip, isn't it?
[02:45:10.223 --> 02:45:14.165]  They tell you how nutritious it is, and it's going to, you know, up your IQ level.
[02:45:14.205 --> 02:45:15.346]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[02:45:16.013 --> 02:45:17.333]  Buy Marisol's Poison, folks.
[02:45:17.653 --> 02:45:19.974]  No, you're one of them conspiracy theorists.
[02:45:20.134 --> 02:45:20.714]  I must be.
[02:45:22.735 --> 02:45:24.295]  Thank you so much for the call, Maggie.
[02:45:24.315 --> 02:45:29.236]  We'll go to Bo and Steve in a minute, but right now, here is CBS Local, but this wasn't News Feed.
[02:45:29.276 --> 02:45:39.899]  That's where CBS Broadcast Center in Manhattan gives them the images, and every major CBS affiliate in the country then reads the teleprompter to these images to give it a local look and feel.
[02:45:40.219 --> 02:45:42.920]  So this was federally produced at the national level.
[02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:44.740]  Here they are saying it's good for you.
[02:45:45.365 --> 02:45:47.787]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[02:45:48.028 --> 02:45:51.391]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[02:45:51.992 --> 02:45:54.034]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[02:45:54.134 --> 02:45:56.796]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[02:45:56.816 --> 02:46:00.260]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter, Suman Mather.
[02:46:02.862 --> 02:46:08.845]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:46:09.306 --> 02:46:15.749]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[02:46:16.209 --> 02:46:23.173]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:46:23.733 --> 02:46:24.074]  All right.
[02:46:25.154 --> 02:46:26.475]  Now, let's be clear.
[02:46:28.180 --> 02:46:32.101]  There is no law you have to take these shots, but Rick Perry says there is with the new one.
[02:46:32.682 --> 02:46:36.663]  And then I have good friends here in town who have some other good friends.
[02:46:36.723 --> 02:46:37.983]  These are even well-to-do people.
[02:46:38.023 --> 02:46:41.265]  And I always make that point, because imagine how bad it is for the poor who can't defend themselves.
[02:46:41.665 --> 02:46:43.705]  They went to a Seton Clinic to have their baby.
[02:46:44.065 --> 02:46:45.446]  They said, we're going to give you all these shots.
[02:46:45.486 --> 02:46:46.066]  They said no.
[02:46:46.126 --> 02:46:47.687]  The nurse said, I'm calling CPS.
[02:46:48.087 --> 02:46:48.607]  It's the law.
[02:46:48.627 --> 02:46:49.627]  We're going to take your child.
[02:46:50.048 --> 02:46:51.208]  We had to call down there.
[02:46:51.288 --> 02:46:52.788]  We had to tell them the media was coming.
[02:46:52.808 --> 02:46:55.529]  And then they suddenly, CPS came, but said, you're right.
[02:46:55.569 --> 02:46:56.330]  There's no law.
[02:46:56.450 --> 02:46:57.110]  We're leaving.
[02:46:57.702 --> 02:46:59.422]  But basically, we're going to watch you now.
[02:46:59.842 --> 02:47:04.143]  Jason, does that sound like a free society where they terrorize people to inject them with mercury?
[02:47:04.203 --> 02:47:05.484]  Oh, and by the way, they haven't taken it out.
[02:47:05.504 --> 02:47:06.504]  They've increased the mercury.
[02:47:06.584 --> 02:47:06.904]  Jason?
[02:47:07.404 --> 02:47:09.484]  Yeah, it doesn't sound like a free society at all.
[02:47:09.544 --> 02:47:18.926]  It sounds like, you know, a fear-mongering society where it's do-so-or-else and there doesn't have to be any basis in law or fact, you know, to try to pass this thing.
[02:47:18.966 --> 02:47:22.627]  And, you know, with the HPV vaccine that I've heard you talk about, I mean, it's big up here.
[02:47:22.967 --> 02:47:26.708]  I live in a college town, so, you know, they have all these girls scared to death of HPV.
[02:47:28.032 --> 02:47:34.194]  Though it only killed only 9,000 people.
[02:47:34.214 --> 02:47:37.714]  9,710 got it in 2005 and a fraction of it died.
[02:47:38.075 --> 02:47:40.795]  But then they get on the news and say the number one cancer for women.
[02:47:41.155 --> 02:47:42.196]  Total lie!
[02:47:42.256 --> 02:47:43.616]  It's not even on the first 20!
[02:47:44.616 --> 02:47:45.396]  And that's what I hear.
[02:47:45.456 --> 02:47:48.017]  It's like, I don't want ovarian cancer later in my life.
[02:47:48.037 --> 02:47:49.697]  But I just have to snicker for a moment.
[02:47:50.138 --> 02:47:52.698]  I try to give them the information and hopefully they look into it.
[02:47:53.138 --> 02:47:55.719]  But I mean, again, just look at the autism and
[02:47:56.075 --> 02:48:04.985]  You know, the other things they've actually admitted, I mean, Australia admitted to putting SV40, which is simian virus 40, you know, which is a cancer virus, into their vaccinations.
[02:48:05.326 --> 02:48:12.554]  Thimerosal is poison, I mean, you grow up as a kid knowing that if the thermometer breaks, and don't go near the mercury, it's poison, it's bad for you.
[02:48:12.992 --> 02:48:16.255]  I mean, the way that they actually try to pass it off as something that's going to help.
[02:48:16.655 --> 02:48:22.639]  And then, the people don't want fluoride and stop brushing their teeth with it, so now they're going to spread all the crops and meat.
[02:48:23.340 --> 02:48:23.920]  Oh, God.
[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:26.642]  You need your fluoride, Jason Berman.
[02:48:26.983 --> 02:48:30.125]  Then you'll believe Building 7 fell because of small fires.
[02:48:30.826 --> 02:48:33.047]  Then you'll believe they found WMDs.
[02:48:33.087 --> 02:48:35.769]  Then you'll be a brain-damaged servant.
[02:48:36.250 --> 02:48:37.090]  Final segment.
[02:48:37.130 --> 02:48:37.911]  Steve, stay with us.
[02:48:43.340 --> 02:48:48.828]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:49.189 --> 02:48:56.800]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:57.532 --> 02:49:04.595]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.

[02:52:32.889 --> 02:52:34.911]  My guest is Jason Berman's final segment.
[02:52:34.971 --> 02:52:36.252]  Let's go to Steve in Florida.
[02:52:36.292 --> 02:52:37.833]  Steve, you're on the air.
[02:52:37.853 --> 02:52:39.394]  Hi, Alex.
[02:52:39.414 --> 02:52:40.074]  Can you hear me fine?
[02:52:40.294 --> 02:52:40.715]  Yes, sir.
[02:52:41.395 --> 02:52:43.116]  Thank you for having Jason on.
[02:52:43.817 --> 02:52:48.340]  A couple months back, I had a debate over the telephone with Vic Eliason.
[02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:50.982]  He runs a crosstalk radio show out of VCY America.
[02:52:55.694 --> 02:53:04.739]  I sent him, uh, why did the Trade Center's skyscrapers collapse by Dr. Morgan Reynolds, Ph.D., and he refused to believe anything on it.
[02:53:04.999 --> 02:53:09.242]  I talked to him about nine minutes before he hung up on me, went through all the cogent facts.
[02:53:09.342 --> 02:53:12.144]  I was a welder by trade and also in the military.
[02:53:13.264 --> 02:53:19.388]  And, uh, he speaks of many issues that you do, but he refuses to acknowledge the facts of controlled demolitions and
[02:53:20.057 --> 02:53:21.758]  Another fact surrounding 9-1-1.
[02:53:21.798 --> 02:53:27.282]  I wish one of your audience, or more than one, would email him at vick at vcyamerica.org.
[02:53:27.987 --> 02:53:31.349]  And convince them to watch Loose Change, because they won't even take my calls anymore.
[02:53:31.709 --> 02:53:33.910]  I think you should watch Terror Storm, too.
[02:53:34.071 --> 02:53:38.593]  I don't think they can handle, they're so afraid that they won't even look at it.
[02:53:38.933 --> 02:53:45.957]  And people that are like that, I mean, it's good to target somebody who's got a radio show that reaches people, because then that'll reach thousands or millions.
[02:53:46.998 --> 02:53:49.099]  But at a certain point, you've got to move on, my friend.
[02:53:49.179 --> 02:53:50.620]  It's good to hear from you, by the way, Steve.
[02:53:50.860 --> 02:53:51.901]  You haven't called in about a year.
[02:53:51.921 --> 02:53:53.422]  I was a few months back.
[02:53:53.982 --> 02:53:54.903]  I don't want to waste your time.
[02:53:54.943 --> 02:53:56.904]  I usually just call when I've got something important.
[02:53:58.242 --> 02:53:59.083]  It's very frustrating.
[02:53:59.103 --> 02:54:03.024]  The guy's got over a hundred radio stations, and he's not a Limbaugh or a Hannity.
[02:54:03.064 --> 02:54:07.906]  They do discuss a lot of things that you discuss, but it's sad that he refuses to touch this issue.
[02:54:07.946 --> 02:54:15.310]  But perhaps somebody could email him at vic at vcyamerica.org and convince him of the factual nature of loose change.
[02:54:16.350 --> 02:54:20.032]  All right, it's an important filming to get all the films out to everybody.
[02:54:20.112 --> 02:54:21.773]  Let's talk to Allen in Ohio.
[02:54:21.893 --> 02:54:22.653]  Allen, go ahead.
[02:54:23.553 --> 02:54:25.054]  Yes, I was just calling.
[02:54:25.734 --> 02:54:27.315]  I've got a question, real quick.
[02:54:27.708 --> 02:54:33.132]  There were a couple things I came across in doing some research that I thought you guys would be the perfect two people to ask about.
[02:54:34.333 --> 02:54:50.724]  I did find that there was a possible... I ran the name Lemnitzer and Bush together and came across something about the Nixon White House, where Lemnitzer had been brought back in to help clean up the Nixon White House before all the impeachment.
[02:54:51.388 --> 02:54:52.329]  You're talking about L.L.
[02:54:52.389 --> 02:54:55.473]  Lemnitzer, the guy that planned to stage terror attacks?
[02:54:55.513 --> 02:55:03.481]  It's admitted, even on the front line, that Nixon wanted to stage terror attacks at a national convention to get martial law going.
[02:55:03.541 --> 02:55:03.942]  Burmess?
[02:55:04.462 --> 02:55:05.543]  Okay, okay.
[02:55:05.583 --> 02:55:11.530]  Yeah, and for those that don't know, he's the architect of Northwoods, and he introduces loose change to the movie with, you know, carrying out
[02:55:12.399 --> 02:55:16.982]  Uh, terror attacks in the United States, using war games to trick the people into a war with Cuba.
[02:55:17.222 --> 02:55:18.483]  Well, see, that was my thing.
[02:55:18.523 --> 02:55:26.208]  I thought, well, that was a great connection there to the Northwoods thing, was that, I guess, Bush, was he possibly, like, Chief of Staff, or was he working in the Nixon White House?
[02:55:26.268 --> 02:55:26.829]  No, he did.
[02:55:27.329 --> 02:55:28.510]  He did work for Nixon.
[02:55:28.570 --> 02:55:33.193]  He then became, uh, Ambassador to China under Nixon and then CIA Director.
[02:55:33.273 --> 02:55:33.753]  Out of time.
[02:55:34.093 --> 02:55:36.515]  Tim in Michigan, or Missouri, last caller, make it quick.
[02:55:37.307 --> 02:55:45.070]  Yes Alex, I wanted to touch on a quick point real quick about the schools and what goes on with the schools.
[02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.311]  Go ahead.
[02:55:45.331 --> 02:55:47.251]  How these children are just indoctrinated.
[02:55:47.271 --> 02:55:56.475]  You know, I think that we need to do something to combat maybe teaching government in grade school, something like that.
[02:55:57.016 --> 02:56:00.277]  But this is an issue I could discuss with you on a different time.
[02:56:00.317 --> 02:56:02.938]  I know you're... Well, the schools are a lost cause.
[02:56:02.978 --> 02:56:04.299]  Get your children out of them.
[02:56:05.406 --> 02:56:08.009]  Uh, it's just their government training brainwashing centers.
[02:56:08.029 --> 02:56:09.210]  We have their internal documents.
[02:56:09.250 --> 02:56:09.891]  Jason Burmiss?
[02:56:10.392 --> 02:56:12.234]  Yeah, be attentive and inform parents.
[02:56:12.254 --> 02:56:13.315]  That's the best way to combat it.
[02:56:13.835 --> 02:56:14.416]  Absolutely.
[02:56:14.476 --> 02:56:15.437]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:15.477 --> 02:56:16.318]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:16.538 --> 02:56:17.259]  Thank you, Jason.
[02:56:17.980 --> 02:56:18.781]  God bless you all.
