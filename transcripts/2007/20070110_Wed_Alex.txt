[00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:11.557]  ...to be made far enough in advance that the producer will have adequate time to make needed adjustments in their operation.

[00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:41.272]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:41.272 --> 00:00:42.573]  Big Brother.
[00:00:42.573 --> 00:00:44.355]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:46.096]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:47.677]  You want answers?
[00:00:47.677 --> 00:00:49.239]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.442]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:57.506]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:12.178]  Just an interesting side note before we get going here.
[00:01:12.178 --> 00:01:22.427]  The news, and again I don't watch enough local news, I should, is reporting that the cedar pollen is considered high if it's at 500.
[00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.540]  No wonder the entire city, everyone I know, is sick.
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.960]  Everyone I've talked to.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.201]  The radio stations are all reporting that everyone's sick.
[00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:32.061]  18,000!
[00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:46.765]  It was 18,000 late last week into earlier this week, and that's when I thought I had the flu and had the fever and couldn't talk.
[00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:50.486]  So, if I've been a little irritable, people have been asking and sound a little depressed,
[00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:54.723]  It's because I'm not somebody who's accustomed to being sick.
[00:01:54.723 --> 00:01:55.744]  I don't like being sick.
[00:01:55.744 --> 00:01:58.606]  I'm not into being sick.
[00:01:58.606 --> 00:02:00.106]  Most of my employees aren't here.
[00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:03.228]  And they don't even have allergies.
[00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:06.070]  You have to understand, these are people that don't have allergies.
[00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.612]  And they can't go to work.
[00:02:09.612 --> 00:02:11.433]  And there's something going on.
[00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:14.075]  Because my mother has lived here her whole life.
[00:02:14.876 --> 00:02:17.337]  She never had allergies growing up in Austin.
[00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:20.638]  My grandmother has lived here since she got out of college.
[00:02:20.638 --> 00:02:22.839]  She's originally from Dallas.
[00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.580]  She's never had allergies.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.222]  Everybody I know who didn't have allergies has now got them.
[00:02:29.222 --> 00:02:33.023]  And literally, it's like having your brain sucked out of your head.
[00:02:34.412 --> 00:02:35.773]  I mean, that's what it feels like.
[00:02:35.773 --> 00:02:38.455]  It's like stumbling around in a fog.
[00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:42.419]  We're scheduled to have Aaron Russo on in the third hour today.
[00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:49.885]  I know that he was scheduled the last month or two, three separate times, and I'm allowed to tell you now that he still has cancer.
[00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:57.091]  He's in cancer treatment in Houston, Texas, and he's an incredible fighter.
[00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:59.173]  He hasn't really told you the full details.
[00:02:59.173 --> 00:03:03.136]  He's had cancer for four plus years, coming up on five.
[00:03:05.346 --> 00:03:10.389]  And, you know, they told him he'd be a goner a long time ago, and he said, no, I'm not.
[00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.130]  I'm going to fight it.
[00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.611]  And he's been fighting it for four plus years.
[00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:20.674]  And the poor guy has had a bunch of surgeries last year and this year.
[00:03:20.674 --> 00:03:24.296]  And I don't want to say too much.
[00:03:24.296 --> 00:03:26.457]  He'll tell you what he thinks you need to know.
[00:03:26.457 --> 00:03:30.019]  But I mean, we went down there for an interview with him this weekend.
[00:03:30.783 --> 00:03:33.365]  Just to get him on tape.
[00:03:33.365 --> 00:03:40.169]  I'm sure he's going to beat it, but just in case he doesn't, he said, just in case I don't, go ahead and come on down here.
[00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.572]  Because four plus years into this fight, it gets tougher and tougher.
[00:03:44.572 --> 00:03:49.975]  I don't know if he'll tell you the stuff he's been through.
[00:03:49.975 --> 00:03:51.256]  I'm not going to say any more.
[00:03:51.256 --> 00:03:58.060]  He's coming on to talk about solutions and his illness and America's freedom from fascism in the third hour if he feels okay.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.961]  Because he's up and down.
[00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:02.166]  To put it lightly.
[00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:03.387]  But he is doing better right now.
[00:04:03.387 --> 00:04:06.788]  I was interviewing him out in L.A.
[00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:07.649]  when I went out to L.A.
[00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:21.996]  a few weeks ago and he was just too bad off then to be able to do it because his bladder was completely blocked by a tumor and he literally was backing up and swelling up with fluid.
[00:04:21.996 --> 00:04:23.097]  That's just part of it.
[00:04:23.097 --> 00:04:28.460]  But the point is, he's a tough guy and he's an amazing individual and I really like Aaron Russo.
[00:04:29.122 --> 00:04:33.866]  And he's scheduled to join us coming up in the third hour today.
[00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:36.988]  We've got a lady who's an expert on Somalia.
[00:04:36.988 --> 00:04:45.195]  One of these PhDs coming on to talk about... There's a full-scale war going on there right now, and it's just a minor footnote in the news.
[00:04:45.195 --> 00:04:49.839]  That is in the second hour.
[00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:54.683]  I want to analyze propaganda for you.
[00:04:54.683 --> 00:04:54.703]  24.
[00:04:54.703 --> 00:04:57.445]  It's got their new episode coming out.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.405]  And the new season is just all concentration camps, all secret arrests, mass roundups.
[00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:10.909]  And Steve Watson wrote a great article about it, and it actually got 30% criticism.
[00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.711]  I read over some of the comments.
[00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:18.315]  And I want to respond to those people who were criticizing Steve for his article.
[00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:22.938]  New 24 season showcases mass terror, concentration camps.
[00:05:22.938 --> 00:05:25.360]  Bush is set to push for an escalation in troops.
[00:05:26.181 --> 00:05:28.862]  In Iraq, the Democrats are going to go along with it.
[00:05:28.862 --> 00:05:30.403]  We'll break that down as well.
[00:05:30.403 --> 00:05:33.005]  It's just a huge transmission for you today.
[00:05:33.005 --> 00:05:40.028]  Stay with us.
[00:05:40.028 --> 00:05:43.550]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.871]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:53.515]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:54.187 --> 00:06:01.630]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:13.374]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:17.335]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:19.596]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:19.596 --> 00:06:23.437]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:41.682]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:41.682 --> 00:06:49.166]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:06:49.166 --> 00:06:59.972]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:06:59.972 --> 00:07:04.514]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:07:04.814 --> 00:07:10.000]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.163]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:13.163 --> 00:07:22.933]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.
[00:07:22.933 --> 00:07:24.014]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188.

[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.421]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:44.662]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:07:44.662 --> 00:07:47.603]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:07:47.603 --> 00:07:52.805]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:58.466]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:07:58.466 --> 00:08:01.427]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[00:08:01.607 --> 00:08:02.187]  We're good to go.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:30.510]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.930]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:40.613]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:40.613 --> 00:08:43.555]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:43.555 --> 00:09:03.609]  Alright, as I said in the last segment, but for stations joining us, I'll just recap.
[00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:04.330]  Aaron Russo
[00:09:05.151 --> 00:09:06.571]  He doesn't like to talk about himself.
[00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:08.752]  He doesn't want to make a big deal out of it.
[00:09:08.752 --> 00:09:13.694]  But he's been battling cancer for four plus years.
[00:09:13.694 --> 00:09:20.876]  And he got rid of the last tumor in Germany, but then it just came back in different places.
[00:09:20.876 --> 00:09:23.677]  And he is an incredible fighter.
[00:09:23.677 --> 00:09:27.158]  And I didn't know he was a national arm wrestling champion.
[00:09:27.158 --> 00:09:31.219]  I knew he invented thong women's underwear.
[00:09:32.273 --> 00:09:34.414]  And he made, after that, a bunch of big movies.
[00:09:34.414 --> 00:09:36.554]  He brought Led Zeppelin to the U.S.
[00:09:36.554 --> 00:09:43.496]  First club they played at there at the Electric Theater in Chicago.
[00:09:43.496 --> 00:09:45.997]  And so many other things this guy's been involved in.
[00:09:45.997 --> 00:09:53.879]  And then to have Nick Rockefeller come to him and try to get him to sell out to the New World Order.
[00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:59.081]  He went further in a video interview I did in Houston on Saturday of last week.
[00:09:59.924 --> 00:10:06.327]  Then he's ever gone on air and we're putting together the hour and a half plus video we shot.
[00:10:06.327 --> 00:10:13.251]  We're putting together much of that interview for the PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:19.274]  That should be up in the next week because I want to take our time with it and do a good job with it.
[00:10:19.274 --> 00:10:23.496]  But we'll probably by tomorrow play some of those clips here on air.
[00:10:23.496 --> 00:10:27.118]  But we have Aaron Russo himself joining us in the third hour.
[00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:57.052]  uh... he has been in and out of hospital in multiple surgeries in the last few months and uh... he is in houston texas uh... fighting cancer right now at a clinic and so eric russo will be joining us to talk about solutions talk about his own life talk about america freedom to fascism that's why he was scheduled three times in the last month and a half and each time didn't make it because he would try to schedule the interview and then he would feel so bad
[00:10:57.759 --> 00:11:00.901]  That he would be unable to do it.
[00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:05.864]  But he did gut up for us Saturday.
[00:11:05.864 --> 00:11:15.809]  He could tell he just felt absolutely terrible and had trouble coming downstairs into the conference room we were doing the interview in.
[00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:21.873]  But once the cameras turned on, he just lit up like a Christmas tree with that passion for freedom.
[00:11:24.381 --> 00:11:29.024]  I really hope all of you out there go to Infowars.com and get America Freedom to Fascism.
[00:11:29.024 --> 00:11:33.647]  You know, when you get it for $19.95, you can get Terror Storm for $9.95.
[00:11:33.647 --> 00:11:36.669]  That's how important America Freedom to Fascism is.
[00:11:36.669 --> 00:11:51.418]  That's why I'm offering it for such a low price, Terror Storm, to incentivize you getting America Freedom to Fascism, because... I cut my teeth exposing the Federal Reserve,
[00:11:52.538 --> 00:11:56.080]  Fraudulent nature of the Internal Revenue Service.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:02.685]  But you tend to move on from basic foundational staples of understanding our world.
[00:12:02.685 --> 00:12:12.231]  And it's really important that Aaron Russo has gone back and done it in a very professional and entertaining way.
[00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:17.955]  And that's what he's done with America, Freedom to Fascism.
[00:12:17.955 --> 00:12:18.676]  So I commend him.
[00:12:20.736 --> 00:12:24.477]  And as I said, he'll be coming up in the third hour.
[00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:35.899]  We have an expert on the ongoing new war in Somalia, an old score to settle, taking place there right now.
[00:12:35.899 --> 00:12:43.881]  Now, I'm going to get into 24 at the bottom of the hour, and the new season is concerning
[00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:56.296]  Concentration camps, mass terror, mass arrest, and Steve Watson wrote a mild article about 24.
[00:12:56.296 --> 00:13:07.548]  And I went and read some of the comments, and I'd say about 30% disagreed with Steve Watson and the story that he wrote.
[00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:22.687]  So I want to go over his article and then play some of these clips from 24 and then show the people that were criticizing Steve and myself how they're wrong, why they're wrong.
[00:13:22.687 --> 00:13:24.888]  It's a very important article.
[00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:26.668]  Steve writes for Infowars.net.
[00:13:26.668 --> 00:13:28.429]  You can get his stories there.
[00:13:28.429 --> 00:13:29.789]  Paul writes for PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:13:29.789 --> 00:13:31.809]  You can get his stories there.
[00:13:31.809 --> 00:13:35.030]  Aaron Dykes is now writing for JonesReport.com.
[00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.191]  And all of these are original reports
[00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:48.276]  information that we think is important that we're attempting to cover for you, then I would always encourage our listeners to go and visit the sites.
[00:13:48.276 --> 00:13:58.723]  Again, for people that just tuned in, if I sound weird for two weeks straight now, it's because Austin, again, is under massive record pollen counts.
[00:13:58.723 --> 00:13:59.904]  High level for Cedar 500.
[00:13:59.904 --> 00:14:01.845]  It's been 18,000, excuse me, never before recorded.
[00:14:01.845 --> 00:14:02.645]  18,000 in the last week.
[00:14:08.476 --> 00:14:11.757]  And people who've never had allergies are in bed.
[00:14:11.757 --> 00:14:13.157]  The entire city is sick.
[00:14:13.157 --> 00:14:16.038]  I mean, I haven't found anybody who isn't sick.
[00:14:16.038 --> 00:14:17.278]  Everyone is sick.
[00:14:17.278 --> 00:14:27.601]  And so I apologize if I am not as sharp as normal, or if I sound like a bumbling idiot, basically.
[00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:33.142]  It's because I have to truly focus to even think.
[00:14:33.142 --> 00:14:36.623]  Alright, I'll make another announcement probably in the third hour, but that's enough announcements for now.
[00:14:39.722 --> 00:14:50.204]  A whole bunch of birds, as you know, died a couple days ago in downtown Austin, so they shut down downtown and panicked and thought Al-Qaeda might be hitting us.
[00:14:50.204 --> 00:14:59.587]  Cops had panic attacks and psychosomatic mental problems and thought that they were sick.
[00:14:59.587 --> 00:15:02.447]  Or who knows, they were probably just sick from pollen.
[00:15:02.447 --> 00:15:05.568]  And had to go to the hospital, so they shut down downtown.
[00:15:07.353 --> 00:15:11.535]  For about 12 hours, parts of downtown.
[00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:13.336]  And now we have this.
[00:15:13.336 --> 00:15:15.197]  This is from the Australian.
[00:15:15.197 --> 00:15:18.439]  Birds fall from sky in Australia.
[00:15:18.439 --> 00:15:22.181]  Thousands of birds have fallen from the skies.
[00:15:22.181 --> 00:15:23.521]  And no one knows why.
[00:15:23.521 --> 00:15:26.663]  It is an illness, toxins, or natural phenomenon.
[00:15:26.663 --> 00:15:31.025]  A string of autopsies in Perth have shed no light on the mystery.
[00:15:31.025 --> 00:15:35.948]  All the residents of the flood devastated Esperance
[00:15:37.003 --> 00:15:41.885]  No, it is their dawn chorus of singing birds is missing.
[00:15:41.885 --> 00:15:57.390]  The main casualties are waddle birds, yellow-throat minnows, New Holland honey eaters and singing honey eaters, although some dead crows, hawks and pigeons have also been found.
[00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:06.173]  Wildlife officers are baffled by the catastrophic events which the Department of Environment and Conservation said began before last week's freak snow.
[00:16:07.339 --> 00:16:17.866]  On Monday, Esperus, 725 KM southeast of Perth, was declared a natural disaster zone.
[00:16:17.866 --> 00:16:26.192]  District's Nature Conservation Coordinator, Mike Fitzgerald, said the first reports of birds dropping dead in people's yards came in three weeks ago.
[00:16:26.192 --> 00:16:32.857]  More than 500 deaths have since been notified, but the calls stopped suddenly last week, reportedly because no birds were left.
[00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:35.464]  It's very substantial.
[00:16:35.464 --> 00:16:47.409]  We estimate several thousand birds are dead, although we don't have a clear number because of the large areas of the bushland.
[00:16:47.409 --> 00:16:54.871]  The planet is not doing too well, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:54.871 --> 00:16:56.972]  Now, we have no idea what's causing this.
[00:16:56.972 --> 00:16:58.393]  No, no idea.
[00:16:58.393 --> 00:16:58.993]  I have no idea.
[00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:21.480]  We know that over-the-horizon radar, we know that with HAARP systems, we know with energy weapons, these are admitted developed systems, in the 60s, they can kill anything in the air for hundreds of square miles, if not thousands.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.042]  I know talking to different engineers and folks over the years,
[00:17:25.823 --> 00:17:36.767]  That if birds fly through a high-powered microwave relay tower, when it's transmitting, it will kill them.
[00:17:36.767 --> 00:17:44.609]  And a lot of times, just beneath these things, you know, out for several miles away, line of sight, there'll just be dead bird carcasses.
[00:17:44.609 --> 00:17:47.750]  So we know that stuff's going on.
[00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.031]  It knocks birds out of the air.
[00:17:49.031 --> 00:17:52.132]  Very, very nutritious, the stuff we're putting into the air.
[00:17:54.273 --> 00:18:02.080]  Whenever a cell phone goes off here at the office, all the electronic equipment goes crazy, and I go, oh, that's our electronic vitamins and minerals.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.341]  I'm being sarcastic, folks.
[00:18:03.341 --> 00:18:12.269]  I don't really think it's broadcasting vitamins and minerals.
[00:18:12.269 --> 00:18:14.651]  Or did some poison get into the water?
[00:18:14.651 --> 00:18:15.772]  Is it some type of fungus?
[00:18:17.128 --> 00:18:29.994]  We know that because of genetically engineered crops and organisms that this then heightens hyper allergies in every known animal species.
[00:18:29.994 --> 00:18:38.758]  And then it causes other naturally occurring allergens to accelerate the allergenic response.
[00:18:38.758 --> 00:18:41.819]  So maybe the birds are dropping dead from that.
[00:18:43.175 --> 00:18:44.436]  I know this, though.
[00:18:44.436 --> 00:18:53.099]  We buy a lot of children's books, because our children don't really watch television maybe an hour a week.
[00:18:53.099 --> 00:19:00.242]  Half the children's books have got some anti-people, New World Order message.
[00:19:00.242 --> 00:19:11.307]  I was at the Aquarium in Corpus Christi six months ago, and I just grabbed a few books on whales, and I didn't really read what they were about.
[00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:19.914]  Two of them were propaganda, and in one of them there's this little whale, and his parents are all going to kill themselves.
[00:19:19.914 --> 00:19:21.775]  That's a good message for children.
[00:19:21.775 --> 00:19:24.956]  So obviously I haven't given the book to my children.
[00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:32.600]  The whales are all going to beast themselves, to kill themselves in California, because they're depressed that the humans have littered.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:40.343]  There's boats and bicycles and Christmas trees in the bay, and so the whole family is going to commit suicide.
[00:19:41.329 --> 00:19:43.291]  Until the humans figure out their error.
[00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:48.075]  Let me just give everybody a news flash.
[00:19:48.075 --> 00:19:54.600]  They tell you environmentalism is about stopping sunken boats and refrigerators.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:01.646]  If you actually study the aquatic world, which I've just done a layman's study of, they love it.
[00:20:01.646 --> 00:20:02.847]  They need it.
[00:20:02.847 --> 00:20:03.628]  They want it.
[00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:08.501]  They, life clings to just metal.
[00:20:08.501 --> 00:20:10.121]  That's not causing a problem.
[00:20:10.121 --> 00:20:20.065]  But see, in the phony environmental movement, Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club, Save the Ocean People, it's all about stopping litter.
[00:20:20.065 --> 00:20:23.867]  That is nothing compared to genetic engineered organisms.
[00:20:23.867 --> 00:20:26.988]  They're making stuff that can kill the ocean.
[00:20:26.988 --> 00:20:27.648]  Okay?
[00:20:27.648 --> 00:20:31.130]  That's, it's just, it's a joke.
[00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.371]  They're worried about cows, flatulence, but not genetic engineering.
[00:20:36.787 --> 00:20:40.108]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:20:40.108 --> 00:20:45.290]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.951]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:20:49.951 --> 00:20:59.074]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:20:59.074 --> 00:21:02.675]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:21:02.975 --> 00:21:08.303]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:21:08.303 --> 00:21:14.994]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:21:15.518 --> 00:21:16.819]  What about you?
[00:21:16.819 --> 00:21:22.225]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:21:36.443 --> 00:21:38.904]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:38.904 --> 00:21:49.387]  Did you know that President Kennedy signed into law State Department Publication 7277 entitled, The United States Program for Complete and General Disarmament in a Peaceful World?
[00:21:49.387 --> 00:21:55.389]  This would disarm America and turn all of our armed forces over to the United Nations Organization.
[00:21:55.389 --> 00:21:59.850]  Citizens would be required to turn in their guns guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment.
[00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:06.998]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.
[00:22:06.998 --> 00:22:15.309]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:37.279 --> 00:22:39.962]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:39.962 --> 00:22:49.331]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:49.331 --> 00:22:56.538]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:57.245 --> 00:23:03.229]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:03.229 --> 00:23:14.816]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:14.816 --> 00:23:17.378]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:23:26.343 --> 00:23:29.105]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[00:23:29.105 --> 00:23:30.186]  January 10, 2007.
[00:23:30.186 --> 00:23:30.646]  Gold 609.70.
[00:23:30.646 --> 00:23:31.987]  Ounce gold coin 630.05.
[00:23:31.987 --> 00:23:32.848]  317.58 for half.
[00:23:32.848 --> 00:23:34.509]  158.79 for quarter ounce coins at 630.05.
[00:23:34.509 --> 00:23:34.529]  317.58. 158.79.
[00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:52.943]  1971, Nissan closes the gold window.
[00:23:52.943 --> 00:23:57.787]  Fiat currency, 1920s, the German market explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[00:23:57.787 --> 00:24:01.790]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.672]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[00:24:04.672 --> 00:24:08.195]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[00:24:08.195 --> 00:24:11.178]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[00:24:11.178 --> 00:24:16.822]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[00:24:16.822 --> 00:24:18.263]  Could government let this happen?
[00:24:18.263 --> 00:24:20.225]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[00:24:20.505 --> 00:24:27.668]  Midas has Nick Bereshev's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[00:24:27.668 --> 00:24:29.489]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[00:24:29.489 --> 00:24:30.830]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:31.010]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:24:53.504 --> 00:24:57.746]  Yeah, I mean these children's books are just so macabre.
[00:24:57.746 --> 00:25:06.050]  And every children's show on PBS about animals, it's always got some anti-human, pro-death message.
[00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:11.493]  So there's this children's book that I've got, where the whales are all going to commit suicide.
[00:25:13.112 --> 00:25:25.574]  Yeah, because the evil humans have thrown their barbecue pits and their old cars into the ocean, which actually become huge points, nexus points of life, and don't pollute anything.
[00:25:25.574 --> 00:25:34.956]  I mean, certainly you don't want people throwing their garbage in on top coral reefs and big dumps of, say, plastic off of tanker ships, as they do, and landfill dumping.
[00:25:34.956 --> 00:25:37.276]  That's not good, because that does float around.
[00:25:37.276 --> 00:25:42.437]  But I mean, just, you know, the message that metal cars thrown into the ocean
[00:25:43.439 --> 00:25:45.881]  Are going to kill the planet Earth.
[00:25:45.881 --> 00:25:52.245]  No, real conservation groups get all derelict ships, get them cleaned out and take them out and get them sunk.
[00:25:52.245 --> 00:25:59.950]  And it's huge areas of new coral development and life in just a few years.
[00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.131]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:26:02.367 --> 00:26:09.031]  The real environmental threat is genetic engineering, and it's causing problems all over the place.
[00:26:09.031 --> 00:26:13.413]  And these organisms, these genetically modified organisms, have gotten out.
[00:26:13.413 --> 00:26:14.534]  They are mutating.
[00:26:14.534 --> 00:26:19.236]  They are mixing with other species and other creatures.
[00:26:19.236 --> 00:26:24.139]  And the evidence is, it is causing all sorts of problems.
[00:26:24.139 --> 00:26:27.901]  And then you get into the next most dangerous thing, chemicals.
[00:26:27.901 --> 00:26:29.162]  These chemical plants.
[00:26:29.944 --> 00:26:37.567]  And then radiation, from all these radiation-emitting facilities.
[00:26:37.567 --> 00:26:44.389]  The environmentalists will yell and scream about some nuclear power plant, which certainly isn't the cleanest thing in the world.
[00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:46.210]  Now some environmentalists say it is clean.
[00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.431]  No, it's pretty dangerous.
[00:26:48.431 --> 00:26:50.972]  Though I support developing nuclear power.
[00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.613]  People who say it's totally cleaner liars, those who say it's totally dirtier liars.
[00:26:55.613 --> 00:26:59.917]  The big thing is all these nuclear weapons, the stuff they're storing, the use of DU.
[00:26:59.917 --> 00:27:03.179]  I mean, where are the environmental groups on all of this?
[00:27:03.179 --> 00:27:14.128]  They're not, because they're controlled by Dutch Rochelle, and the Nature Conservancy, and the Sierra Club, and the Autobahn Society, and all these big tax-free foundations that are nothing but land grabbers.
[00:27:15.345 --> 00:27:22.855]  You know, they want to grab some farmer's land to build buildings and golf courses on it five years later when everybody's forgotten about it.
[00:27:22.855 --> 00:27:25.078]  That's what Nature Conservancy and Sierra Club do.
[00:27:25.078 --> 00:27:28.382]  They're criminals.
[00:27:28.382 --> 00:27:30.826]  Nature Conservancy is the biggest landowner in the U.S.
[00:27:32.447 --> 00:27:44.916]  And they get control of most of the property where I live here in Austin and they turn around and build five-star hotels and spas and skyscrapers and multi-million dollar ranchettes.
[00:27:44.916 --> 00:27:47.778]  And I know the old farmers and people who have their land taken from them.
[00:27:48.986 --> 00:27:56.830]  Oh, it's going to be a park and all these fruitcake wannabe hippies who went along with it.
[00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:02.313]  Now, back when they were taking all the property, the little hippies were the big stars.
[00:28:02.313 --> 00:28:06.375]  They got on the news, the newspaper, the city council brought them in.
[00:28:06.375 --> 00:28:08.756]  Now, they don't get the time of day.
[00:28:09.463 --> 00:28:11.484]  And now they're all shoved to the side.
[00:28:11.484 --> 00:28:16.947]  See, you were used as the cause celebs, as the useful idiots then.
[00:28:16.947 --> 00:28:22.029]  Now, now that you see the scam, you don't get any air time, do you?
[00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:31.094]  You're not laughing anymore like you were at me at that Smart Growth Conference in 1998, when they got up there, the big bank heads of Bank of America,
[00:28:32.973 --> 00:28:41.938]  And, uh, Michael Dell and former Dallas Cowboys, and they were just bragging about how it was all business, and a big land grab, and laughing at everyone.
[00:28:41.938 --> 00:28:43.979]  I mean, they just laugh in public!
[00:28:43.979 --> 00:28:46.640]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.141]  Oh, it's so funny!
[00:28:48.141 --> 00:28:50.943]  Ha ha ha!
[00:28:50.943 --> 00:28:54.645]  Oh, it's so funny what's going on!
[00:28:54.645 --> 00:29:01.188]  They take all your energy for an environmental movement that is needed and legitimate, and there is a threat to the environment,
[00:29:02.196 --> 00:29:05.419]  It may have already gone too far, folks.
[00:29:05.419 --> 00:29:08.943]  And, oh no, let's not have any real solutions to it.
[00:29:08.943 --> 00:29:19.674]  Let's have a global tax on fossil fuel emissions, which will do absolutely nothing.
[00:29:19.674 --> 00:29:25.540]  I mean, even if you believe the Earth is heating up for the reasons that you've been told, which that's not why it's heating up,
[00:29:26.355 --> 00:29:29.737]  Even if you believe that, do you understand this?
[00:29:29.737 --> 00:29:33.999]  I'm attacking your religious tenant now.
[00:29:33.999 --> 00:29:48.165]  Even if you believe in global warming, then you must understand that their solution is not a solution.
[00:29:48.165 --> 00:29:50.266]  And by the way, humans do heat up the earth.
[00:29:51.733 --> 00:29:54.074]  But it is not the fossil fuels.
[00:29:54.074 --> 00:29:56.735]  I've seen all the big university studies on it.
[00:29:56.735 --> 00:29:58.656]  These are hard numbers.
[00:29:58.656 --> 00:30:02.418]  Even the UN had to admit it last month.
[00:30:02.418 --> 00:30:03.919]  It is not the cars.
[00:30:03.919 --> 00:30:05.840]  It is not the gases.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.921]  It is the concrete.
[00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:11.062]  It is the black topped roads.
[00:30:11.062 --> 00:30:13.223]  It is the impervious cover.
[00:30:13.223 --> 00:30:15.564]  It is the cities.
[00:30:15.564 --> 00:30:17.285]  They're huge heat generators.
[00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.951]  And that is still about 3% of it.
[00:30:22.951 --> 00:30:24.031]  The rest is the sun.
[00:30:24.031 --> 00:30:27.253]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:27.253 --> 00:30:28.633]  We're on the march.
[00:30:28.633 --> 00:30:30.254]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:30.254 --> 00:30:33.855]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:37.466 --> 00:30:41.648]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[00:30:41.648 --> 00:30:45.470]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:49.832]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[00:30:49.832 --> 00:30:51.013]  I was so amazed.
[00:30:51.013 --> 00:30:54.054]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[00:30:54.054 --> 00:30:56.315]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[00:30:56.315 --> 00:31:01.498]  SoliWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[00:31:01.958 --> 00:31:08.161]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[00:31:08.161 --> 00:31:10.122]  I figured it would clean really well.
[00:31:10.122 --> 00:31:13.503]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[00:31:13.503 --> 00:31:17.665]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[00:31:17.665 --> 00:31:19.486]  Plus, the service was great.
[00:31:19.486 --> 00:31:24.649]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit soleilwellness.com.
[00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:25.469]  That's S-O-L-E-I-L.
[00:31:25.649 --> 00:31:26.750]  Pinch me, Bill.
[00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:27.250]  I can't believe it.
[00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.092]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car.
[00:31:30.092 --> 00:31:33.154]  And here we are with season tickets on the 50-yard line.
[00:31:48.672 --> 00:31:49.713]  I know what you mean, John.
[00:31:49.713 --> 00:31:54.436]  I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[00:31:54.436 --> 00:31:58.338]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:31:58.338 --> 00:32:00.379]  I was struggling to make ends meet.
[00:32:00.379 --> 00:32:05.562]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.
[00:32:05.562 --> 00:32:06.623]  And I owe it all to you.
[00:32:07.223 --> 00:32:10.584]  Because you told me about DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:10.584 --> 00:32:13.666]  Hey John, we all win when the money problems disappear.
[00:32:13.666 --> 00:32:15.206]  I want to tell everybody.
[00:32:15.206 --> 00:32:18.947]  Because the more people we have on the success team, the better it works.
[00:32:18.947 --> 00:32:20.888]  It's hard for the little guy these days.
[00:32:20.888 --> 00:32:23.669]  We pool our resources to level the playing field.
[00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:30.152]  So the more people that go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com, the more cash for everybody.
[00:32:30.152 --> 00:32:30.972]  What a concept!
[00:32:36.952 --> 00:32:38.854]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[00:32:38.854 --> 00:32:47.803]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[00:32:47.803 --> 00:32:53.528]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[00:32:54.349 --> 00:33:01.695]  This is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[00:33:01.695 --> 00:33:07.319]  Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag.
[00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:11.583]  Each memorial marker is specifically designed to represent one of 15 wars.
[00:33:11.583 --> 00:33:18.088]  All markers include a three-eighths inch pointed and threaded aluminum rod, painted and highlighted for an appearance that is unforgettable.
[00:33:18.088 --> 00:33:20.830]  What better way to pay homage to our enlisted loved ones?
[00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.891]  We're good to go.
[00:33:49.435 --> 00:34:01.099]  I mean, we have our governments running around using the equivalent of 40,000 Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.
[00:34:01.099 --> 00:34:10.663]  We have thousands of biotech companies just randomly splicing cross-species, cross-family.
[00:34:10.663 --> 00:34:16.805]  I mean, we're talking plant and animal, insect, mammal together, openly planting it in fields.
[00:34:17.938 --> 00:34:31.105]  You know, I've gotten up on air and talked about Protegene here in Texas, who in, what was it, 44 locations from Nebraska to Texas, planted HIV corn.
[00:34:31.105 --> 00:34:33.046]  They grew some of it right out by Bush's Ranch.
[00:34:33.046 --> 00:34:36.328]  I was driven by the facility.
[00:34:36.328 --> 00:34:42.611]  Open-air corn that has live HIV virus contained in its kernels.
[00:34:42.611 --> 00:34:43.572]  And people criticize me.
[00:34:45.264 --> 00:34:46.825]  I've had a newspaper criticize me.
[00:34:46.825 --> 00:34:49.447]  I've had some local kook criticize me.
[00:34:49.447 --> 00:34:52.508]  They don't go look it up that it was in the Associated Press.
[00:34:52.508 --> 00:35:06.636]  They don't go find out it was a big hysteria with the federal government running around eradicating it, because some of the corn jumped into some nearby similar plant species.
[00:35:06.636 --> 00:35:12.359]  Of course, they were trying to get a corn that they would give the Africans, so then they would, quote, be vaccinated against AIDS.
[00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:19.093]  Kind of like they engineer the virus that gives women cervical cancer, and then they've got a vaccine for you.
[00:35:19.093 --> 00:35:28.177]  And if you think that thing is going to really save you from cervical cancer, when their whole business is giving you cancer, we're just completely... I mean, this is just... this is a joke!
[00:35:28.177 --> 00:35:34.480]  Let's just take everybody's farm and ranch, steal private property, have a global tax, that'll save everybody from the global warming.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.561]  The entire solar system is heating up.
[00:35:38.206 --> 00:35:47.148]  Okay, that's what the French, the German, the U.S., the Japanese satellites all show conclusively.
[00:35:47.148 --> 00:35:50.669]  The entire solar system is warming.
[00:35:50.669 --> 00:35:54.549]  Surprise, surprise, the sun controls us.
[00:35:54.549 --> 00:35:59.190]  That's where the life and the death comes from.
[00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:05.792]  You know that yellow dwarf, 93 million miles away, isn't it 93 million?
[00:36:05.792 --> 00:36:06.672]  I'm going from memory here.
[00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:14.314]  Seven and a half minutes for its radiation to get here.
[00:36:14.314 --> 00:36:22.919]  If we didn't have an atmosphere, and the Van Allen radiation belt, its radiation would just shoot through and completely fry us in a matter of minutes.
[00:36:22.919 --> 00:36:25.061]  We'd all be dead.
[00:36:25.061 --> 00:36:32.405]  But there's a huge magnetic field around the Earth, so almost all the radiation shoots around the planet.
[00:36:32.405 --> 00:36:34.607]  I mean, we are creatures that have been developed
[00:36:35.248 --> 00:36:39.129]  And we're designed to live in high radiation environments.
[00:36:39.129 --> 00:36:45.050]  We live in an extreme high radiation environment.
[00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:48.451]  That's what causes our cells to finally mutate one too many times and kills us.
[00:36:48.451 --> 00:36:54.052]  Alright, I'm already digressing.
[00:36:54.052 --> 00:36:58.793]  I had all this news I wanted to cover and I'm just... I'm just digressing here.
[00:37:00.402 --> 00:37:04.324]  By the way, the science I'm talking about is not some area of debated science.
[00:37:04.324 --> 00:37:12.028]  This is science that's been flushed out and confirmed to be laws.
[00:37:12.028 --> 00:37:25.835]  So, hey, I care about the environment, but the fake solutions that Al Gore and George Bush noticed now he's for it, and Arnold Schwarzenegger are all pushing, it has nothing to do with saving this planet.
[00:37:26.599 --> 00:37:29.900]  And I know six and a half billion people are hurting the earth.
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:47.224]  I mean, anybody who argues and says we aren't is lying, but once you industrialize, you get a negative population growth, which is totally sustainable, and with the technologies we've been developing will even be more sustainable and can reverse what's happened to the earth.
[00:37:47.224 --> 00:37:53.586]  But just normal human activity, normal human activity is not
[00:37:54.455 --> 00:38:02.718]  It's negligible compared to the genetic engineering that is being carried out by the elites in their quest for the Holy Grail.
[00:38:02.718 --> 00:38:07.360]  That's their main reason they're pushing, is they want new medical breakthroughs.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.421]  That, of course, are kept for themselves, not for the people.
[00:38:11.421 --> 00:38:20.445]  Alright, if you heard the news today, you know, the passive American or Brit or Canadian or European, oh, the Democrats are challenging Bush's plan!
[00:38:23.846 --> 00:38:38.699]  But when you actually read into the fine print, it says they're talking about a non-binding resolution that's kind of like, today will be beef producer's day.
[00:38:38.699 --> 00:38:39.880]  It means nothing.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.644]  Just a criticism of how Bush has handled the war, and continuing the funding.
[00:38:46.474 --> 00:38:50.195]  Here's CNN's Senate-to-debate resolution opposing Iraq war.
[00:38:50.195 --> 00:38:54.997]  The Democratic-controlled Senate will begin considering a non-binding, did you hear that part?
[00:38:54.997 --> 00:38:59.539]  Non-binding resolution next week opposing President Bush's new Iraq policy.
[00:38:59.539 --> 00:39:03.520]  Senator Harry Reid, Democrat-Nevada, announced Tuesday.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:12.323]  The resolution trumps an effort by Senator Edward Kennedy, Democrat-Mass, to require President Bush to seek specific authorization before increasing troops in Iraq.
[00:39:16.591 --> 00:39:20.454]  So, Kennedy, as normal, comes out, who's wildly unpopular.
[00:39:20.454 --> 00:39:22.055]  They always have him push it.
[00:39:22.055 --> 00:39:27.460]  Then that gets slapped down, and then, okay, we'll just have a resolution criticizing it.
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:30.282]  The big news on what the Democrats are doing is this.
[00:39:30.282 --> 00:39:35.646]  Democrats beef police state with 9-1-1 commission bill.
[00:39:35.646 --> 00:39:46.114]  Remember the 50-plus recommendations, national ID card, internal checkpoints, checkpoints in malls, total control, massive increases in domestic spying?
[00:39:46.824 --> 00:39:50.325]  Well, Bush didn't implement all of them, because he couldn't.
[00:39:50.325 --> 00:39:52.946]  And then, because the Republican Congress wouldn't.
[00:39:52.946 --> 00:39:56.767]  And now, the Democrats are coming out as if, oh, Bush hasn't done a good job!
[00:39:56.767 --> 00:39:57.947]  We're gonna keep you safe!
[00:39:57.947 --> 00:40:04.169]  We're gonna demand all the recommendations of the 9-11 Commission, appointed by Bush!
[00:40:04.169 --> 00:40:06.210]  And then Democrats go, that'll show them!
[00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:09.311]  I mean, you see, this is a great example of how they good cop, bad cop us.
[00:40:12.159 --> 00:40:23.082]  Democrats beef police state with 9-1-1 Commission's bill, political opposition also helping Bush gain traction for Iran military strike.
[00:40:23.082 --> 00:40:30.023]  House Democrats have passed a piece of legislation that was crafted on the back of recommendations made by the 9-11 Commission in 2004 in final report.
[00:40:30.023 --> 00:40:40.986]  The bill is a tonic for big government, increased federalization of America, and mandates expansion of no-fly list, terror watch list, and further government surveillance of American citizens.
[00:40:42.259 --> 00:40:42.940]  While H.R.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:49.864]  1 Bill contains some welcome provisions, including a redress of grievance process for passengers unfairly delayed.
[00:40:49.864 --> 00:40:53.066]  But that's bad too, because it just puts it into a process.
[00:40:53.066 --> 00:40:54.527]  It shouldn't be happening.
[00:40:54.527 --> 00:40:59.570]  Refused boarding for flights and a re-commitment to the Geneva Conventions.
[00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:08.416]  Yeah, you see, again, oh, we're gathering all your private data illegally and putting it in the database, but we'll now let you at least get off the list or complain.
[00:41:08.416 --> 00:41:09.277]  No, that's not good.
[00:41:13.175 --> 00:41:14.635]  And I've read it.
[00:41:14.635 --> 00:41:19.417]  It just gets into, you know, a recommitment, but it's only verbal to the Geneva Conventions.
[00:41:19.417 --> 00:41:28.939]  It's largely a nightmare for opponents of big government in that it vastly increases funding for the scope of Homeland Security, FEMA, and further federalizes law enforcement.
[00:41:28.939 --> 00:41:30.820]  And the article goes on for four pages.
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.800]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:37.402]  I mean, give this to all your Democratic friends that are running around smiling, saying, We're saved!
[00:41:37.402 --> 00:41:38.602]  Nancy Pelosi!
[00:41:45.274 --> 00:41:48.836]  Again, the Democrats come in and they say, we're going to do what the 9-11 Commission says.
[00:41:48.836 --> 00:41:53.458]  We're going to do what the Iraq Study Group says.
[00:41:53.458 --> 00:41:54.839]  Both appointed by Bush.
[00:41:54.839 --> 00:41:58.741]  Both shadow government cronies going back 30 years.
[00:41:58.741 --> 00:42:03.744]  Running, I mean, from Kissinger to James Baker.
[00:42:03.744 --> 00:42:04.804]  We'll get you, Bush.
[00:42:04.804 --> 00:42:07.766]  We'll make the 9-11 Commission's recommendations be put in.
[00:42:07.766 --> 00:42:10.087]  We'll give you even more power.
[00:42:10.087 --> 00:42:13.128]  And we'll criticize how you're handling the war.
[00:42:13.128 --> 00:42:14.049]  You screwed up.
[00:42:14.764 --> 00:42:19.685]  Here, let's increase troops!
[00:42:19.685 --> 00:42:32.928]  I mean, we say we want the troops home, and their answer is, we're going to increase the troops.
[00:42:32.928 --> 00:42:39.810]  You watch, there'll be a Democrat in 08, and we'll be there, we'll be there in 2050.
[00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:43.131]  Mark my words, unless the New World Order starts collapsing.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.723]  Like the Soviet Union.
[00:42:46.723 --> 00:42:49.566]  And most of that was staged.
[00:42:49.566 --> 00:42:50.266]  Okay?
[00:42:50.266 --> 00:42:52.749]  Just, just, just remember my words!
[00:42:52.749 --> 00:42:54.411]  Okay?
[00:42:54.411 --> 00:42:56.473]  Everything they tell you is a lie.
[00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:58.134]  Alright, let me get into 24 here.
[00:42:58.134 --> 00:42:59.756]  We got several clips.
[00:42:59.756 --> 00:43:06.723]  The first one I want to play, just to set the tone here, is Laura Ingram, government operative, who's called for my arrest.
[00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:10.160]  Saying I'm American Al-Qaeda.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.341]  Yeah, I fight LCIA, the lady.
[00:43:12.341 --> 00:43:13.482]  You know it, don't you?
[00:43:13.482 --> 00:43:16.763]  I'm defending the Republic, unlike you, you fake conservative traitor.
[00:43:16.763 --> 00:43:17.504]  Here she is.
[00:43:17.504 --> 00:43:18.804]  Everybody loves Jack Bauer.
[00:43:18.804 --> 00:43:20.785]  Fox News.
[00:43:20.785 --> 00:43:25.088]  The average American out there loves the show 24, okay?
[00:43:25.088 --> 00:43:26.348]  They love Jack Bauer.
[00:43:26.348 --> 00:43:27.449]  They love 24.
[00:43:27.449 --> 00:43:35.293]  In my mind, that's as close to a national referendum that it's okay to use tough tactics against high-level Al-Qaeda operatives as we're gonna get, okay?
[00:43:35.894 --> 00:43:38.955]  Crushing children's genitalia with pliers.
[00:43:38.955 --> 00:43:43.195]  White House Memorandum Command memos.
[00:43:43.195 --> 00:43:45.056]  Sure.
[00:43:45.056 --> 00:43:48.836]  I mean, this lady is just a smiley-faced operative, folks.
[00:43:48.836 --> 00:43:50.596]  They're there to destroy America.
[00:43:50.596 --> 00:43:53.857]  They're there to neutralize conservatives until it's too late to turn it around.
[00:43:53.857 --> 00:43:55.757]  Okay, do you understand that?
[00:43:55.757 --> 00:44:01.278]  Now, everybody's emailing me and posting on the MySpace going, how did you know?
[00:44:01.278 --> 00:44:05.539]  I didn't know that Jack Bauer was a whole cult for neocons.
[00:44:06.408 --> 00:44:19.719]  They have C-SPAN Homeland Security dinners where they have producers from 24 on and thank them saying it's the number one tool in winning the hearts and minds of the American people for the war on terror.
[00:44:19.719 --> 00:44:23.162]  I mean, they give them awards!
[00:44:23.162 --> 00:44:24.763]  I mean, it's a joke!
[00:44:25.715 --> 00:44:36.025]  Everything on Fox TV is men are bad, the family's bad, go to Temptation Island, have sex with whores, break up your family, uh, you know, just total garbage.
[00:44:36.025 --> 00:44:37.427]  Everything.
[00:44:37.427 --> 00:44:40.269]  Everything on there except maybe The Simpsons.
[00:44:40.269 --> 00:44:44.053]  And that's still an anti, you know, family mode, the men are all idiots.
[00:44:44.053 --> 00:44:46.916]  There's a few, you know, of course they gotta mix some good stuff in.
[00:44:49.746 --> 00:45:03.370]  24 conditions you subconsciously that there's a real terror threat with nuclear bombs going off, or about to go off, and buses blowing up, and terrorists are real, and terrorists are everywhere.
[00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:12.032]  And of course they mix in a little realism where shadow groups of the government are behind it, but don't worry, Jack Bauer always tracks them down and stops them too.
[00:45:12.032 --> 00:45:16.473]  But for the mind-numbed masses who just look at things in a suspended disbelief
[00:45:17.225 --> 00:45:18.066]  They're sleepwalking.
[00:45:18.066 --> 00:45:20.148]  They've done the brain scans.
[00:45:20.148 --> 00:45:28.215]  When you're watching TV, on average, for more than about 20 minutes, you shift into... You're like, man, I was daydreaming watching TV.
[00:45:28.215 --> 00:45:31.498]  You literally are in a sleep mode, okay?
[00:45:31.498 --> 00:45:33.019]  They teach that in RTF.
[00:45:33.019 --> 00:45:33.920]  For those that didn't know, it's 101.
[00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:45.414]  So, you're in a sleep mode watching this, so yeah, some of you out there are awake to the New World Order, so you send us emails and post on the message board on Prison Planet.
[00:45:45.414 --> 00:45:47.255]  You know, how dare you talk about About 24?
[00:45:47.255 --> 00:45:48.655]  It's my favorite show!
[00:45:48.655 --> 00:45:50.456]  It exposes corruption!
[00:45:50.456 --> 00:45:51.236]  No it doesn't!
[00:45:51.236 --> 00:45:59.000]  The hero tortures children, tortures people's children and wives, tortures government officials' children.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.162]  You know, you gotta do whatever you have to to save people.
[00:46:03.162 --> 00:46:05.263]  America's just one big crime zone.
[00:46:07.886 --> 00:46:15.052]  And believe me, the government says, thank you, this is really helping us.
[00:46:15.052 --> 00:46:22.397]  The neocon websites... I don't know why my cell phone's going off and I can't find it.
[00:46:22.397 --> 00:46:26.160]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:31.184]  The neocon websites are all over just worshipping Jack Bauer.
[00:46:31.184 --> 00:46:33.986]  You see, the average American
[00:46:34.915 --> 00:46:36.656]  Doesn't interface with anybody.
[00:46:36.656 --> 00:46:37.937]  They don't talk to their neighbors anymore.
[00:46:37.937 --> 00:46:39.298]  You drive through neighborhoods.
[00:46:39.298 --> 00:46:42.420]  The houses are all glowing blue.
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.041]  You know, they're mirrors at night.
[00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:46.563]  They're windows.
[00:46:46.563 --> 00:46:47.984]  And they're not talking to each other.
[00:46:47.984 --> 00:46:49.284]  They're not talking to their children.
[00:46:49.284 --> 00:46:52.907]  They're not interfacing or having a life.
[00:46:52.907 --> 00:46:56.969]  They're living through... Their friends are the show friends.
[00:46:56.969 --> 00:46:59.551]  And their friends are Jerry Seinfeld.
[00:46:59.551 --> 00:47:00.912]  And their friends are Jack Bauer.
[00:47:02.523 --> 00:47:05.566]  And it just adds to this hysteria.
[00:47:05.566 --> 00:47:12.693]  That's why they have drills all over the country to create, and they admit, the perception of terror being real.
[00:47:12.693 --> 00:47:14.855]  The idea that it's real.
[00:47:14.855 --> 00:47:16.277]  So let's go ahead and play this first clip.
[00:47:16.277 --> 00:47:22.203]  Now this is TV's, Fox News Channel on big TV's everywhere outside in these cities.
[00:47:24.449 --> 00:47:25.650]  And so it's product placement.
[00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:31.754]  It's Fox News, and there's terrorists everywhere, and a guy's trying to get on a bus, but he's not really a terrorist.
[00:47:31.754 --> 00:47:38.098]  He's a Muslim, but another Muslim blows the bus up, and they're having debates about how martial law is needed, but no, it's not needed.
[00:47:38.098 --> 00:47:40.639]  And again, it's all conditioning.
[00:47:40.639 --> 00:47:46.002]  Because what you see over and over again, you expect to then happen.
[00:47:46.002 --> 00:47:47.924]  It's now been made palatable.
[00:47:47.924 --> 00:47:51.706]  Even if you don't like the idea of it, it breaks the ice with you.
[00:47:53.058 --> 00:47:56.160]  Let's go ahead and roll that first clip.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.481]  America has been victimized again.
[00:47:58.481 --> 00:48:05.985]  Last night's terrorist attack in San Antonio was now the latest in this series of bombings that began 11 weeks ago in 10 different cities.
[00:48:05.985 --> 00:48:14.630]  Over 900 people have been killed thus far, and while no one is claiming responsibility for this wave of death, evidence points to Islamic militants.
[00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:17.852]  Here in Los Angeles, the mood can only be described as tense and fearful,
[00:48:18.476 --> 00:48:25.419]  As the Department of Homeland Security is urging all citizens to report without delay any suspicious persons or activities.
[00:48:25.419 --> 00:48:33.862]  We spoke with a department spokesperson who says, quote, We don't want to start a witch hunt, but we would rather err on the side of caution than become the next target.
[00:48:33.862 --> 00:48:35.403]  And then it went on to say that the vigilance...
[00:48:36.431 --> 00:48:38.933]  Our country is under siege.
[00:48:38.933 --> 00:48:41.415]  You're the National Security Advisor, Karen.
[00:48:41.415 --> 00:48:43.497]  Frankly, I'm surprised by your resistance.
[00:48:43.497 --> 00:48:47.920]  These places that you keep building, they're nothing more than concentration camps.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.022]  Detention facilities.
[00:48:50.022 --> 00:48:54.365]  And the criteria for determining who should be detained are very reasonable.
[00:48:54.365 --> 00:48:54.886]  Reasonable?
[00:48:55.426 --> 00:49:00.289]  This revised plan of yours justifies locking up every American who prays towards Mecca.
[00:49:00.289 --> 00:49:02.410]  That's a ridiculous exaggeration, you know it.
[00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:05.571]  Right now, the American Muslim community is our greatest asset.
[00:49:05.571 --> 00:49:11.615]  They have provided law enforcement with hundreds of tips, and not a single member of that community has been implicated in these attacks.
[00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:12.095]  So far.
[00:49:13.266 --> 00:49:17.849]  Mr. President, the people are losing faith in our ability to protect them.
[00:49:17.849 --> 00:49:20.671]  We've got to do something about this now.
[00:49:20.671 --> 00:49:23.933]  And locking up more Muslims will not make them safer?
[00:49:23.933 --> 00:49:26.815]  No, Karen, but it will make them feel safer.
[00:49:26.815 --> 00:49:30.337]  What about the cost of the civil unrest that your plan will create?
[00:49:30.337 --> 00:49:34.900]  Security has its price.
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:35.861]  So does freedom, Tom.
[00:49:37.893 --> 00:49:40.034]  Listen, I just don't see how I can sign off on something like this.
[00:49:40.034 --> 00:49:46.037]  I mean, wasn't it just three months ago that I took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution?
[00:49:46.037 --> 00:49:50.439]  And what about preserving, protecting, and defending the American people?
[00:49:50.439 --> 00:49:52.300]  All of these measures are legal.
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:55.562]  Blake has been all over this thing with the Attorney General.
[00:49:57.268 --> 00:49:58.609]  Now listen to the propaganda.
[00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:59.249]  It's riddled.
[00:49:59.249 --> 00:50:01.851]  The Attorney General's the final word, you see.
[00:50:01.851 --> 00:50:02.411]  You just heard.
[00:50:02.411 --> 00:50:04.132]  I'm a presidential appointee.
[00:50:04.132 --> 00:50:05.753]  The Attorney General says it's all legal.
[00:50:05.753 --> 00:50:07.995]  And in real life, they've now passed all these laws.
[00:50:07.995 --> 00:50:12.077]  Secret arrest of citizens, secret torture, secret execution.
[00:50:12.077 --> 00:50:14.899]  All codified in the law.
[00:50:14.899 --> 00:50:18.901]  The President can take over all 50 governors.
[00:50:18.901 --> 00:50:21.503]  That was in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[00:50:21.503 --> 00:50:23.764]  That hadn't happened since the Civil War.
[00:50:23.764 --> 00:50:24.805]  All this is in place.
[00:50:26.189 --> 00:50:29.150]  And then they also tell you, see, it's just the Muslims.
[00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:31.591]  It's just going to be the Muslims in these camps.
[00:50:31.591 --> 00:50:32.512]  Bull!
[00:50:32.512 --> 00:50:39.254]  In the last month, Homeland Security Director Michael Chertoff has said the main focus is domestic terror groups.
[00:50:39.254 --> 00:50:47.458]  Militias, white supremacists, and then they expand that out, you see, into the peace groups and any and everybody else.
[00:50:47.458 --> 00:50:48.898]  Who's the Pentagon spying on?
[00:50:48.898 --> 00:50:53.000]  Peace groups that give out peanut butter and jelly sandwiches outside Halliburton.
[00:50:53.948 --> 00:51:00.809]  This is all about you when you go out and protest because they've taken your pension fund so they can gun you down in the street!
[00:51:00.809 --> 00:51:02.509]  That's what all this is about!
[00:51:02.509 --> 00:51:05.330]  They're bringing in record numbers of Muslims!
[00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:11.091]  And again, I'm not even saying that they're that big of a threat.
[00:51:11.091 --> 00:51:17.972]  I think overflowing us with third world populations too quickly will destroy the fabric of this country.
[00:51:17.972 --> 00:51:20.533]  Hell, I got a story right here out of ABC News.
[00:51:20.533 --> 00:51:22.513]  Kids kicked off bus for speaking English
[00:51:24.207 --> 00:51:25.688]  And there'll be more.
[00:51:25.688 --> 00:51:27.109]  I'll tell you about this later.
[00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:28.870]  But we'll come back with more 24.
[00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:33.292]  So see, just everything they're saying is actually conditioning the public.
[00:51:33.292 --> 00:51:34.873]  Every word is propaganda.
[00:51:34.873 --> 00:51:43.618]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:43.618 --> 00:51:45.939]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:45.939 --> 00:51:53.583]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:54.255 --> 00:52:01.717]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:52:01.717 --> 00:52:13.440]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:17.421]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:52:17.421 --> 00:52:19.662]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:52:19.662 --> 00:52:23.503]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:52:24.103 --> 00:52:36.690]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:41.833]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:52:41.833 --> 00:52:49.297]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:52:49.297 --> 00:52:53.219]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria.
[00:52:53.319 --> 00:52:53.999]  We're good to go!
[00:53:23.097 --> 00:53:28.240]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.601]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:52.172]  Yeah, Jack Bauer is most Americans own personal Jesus.
[00:54:52.172 --> 00:54:54.793]  That's how it works!
[00:55:14.304 --> 00:55:17.626]  Sitting at home, you're all alone.
[00:55:17.626 --> 00:55:20.768]  Turn on Fox Television, they'll brainwash you.
[00:55:20.768 --> 00:55:22.048]  I mean, really.
[00:55:22.048 --> 00:55:27.551]  There are people emailing us, there are people on the message board, I'd say about a third of them, hopping mad.
[00:55:27.551 --> 00:55:30.072]  You don't know, Jack Bauer's a good guy.
[00:55:30.072 --> 00:55:33.034]  Jack Bauer, the government is behind the terror.
[00:55:33.034 --> 00:55:35.655]  No, no, no, it's always subgroups.
[00:55:35.655 --> 00:55:40.378]  And it is subgroups that are behind the terror, but it's subgroups at the top.
[00:55:40.378 --> 00:55:42.519]  Not some little side group at the bottom.
[00:55:43.693 --> 00:55:44.794]  I've watched the show before.
[00:55:44.794 --> 00:55:47.315]  I mainly watch key clips online.
[00:55:47.315 --> 00:56:00.560]  One time I was on an airplane flying to England and the guy right in front of me, Catty Corner, was watching an entire season of them.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.382]  I probably watched eight hours of it.
[00:56:04.382 --> 00:56:06.263]  It was just unbelievable.
[00:56:06.263 --> 00:56:07.523]  Unbelievable propaganda.
[00:56:11.022 --> 00:56:13.023]  Again, even people that think they know about the New World Order.
[00:56:13.023 --> 00:56:16.223]  Oh no, this shows how it's bad to take your freedoms.
[00:56:16.223 --> 00:56:19.164]  No, it introduces you to the idea of camps.
[00:56:19.164 --> 00:56:24.766]  It introduces you that this is normal for the government to be doing.
[00:56:24.766 --> 00:56:26.386]  I mean, get a little more sophisticated.
[00:56:26.386 --> 00:56:30.427]  It's FOX TELEVISION!
[00:56:30.427 --> 00:56:32.868]  Man, I mean, we didn't just fall off a turnip truck here.
[00:56:32.868 --> 00:56:34.148]  This is what we do full time.
[00:56:34.148 --> 00:56:35.288]  We know what we're talking about.
[00:56:35.288 --> 00:56:38.029]  Here's another clip from the new TV show, 24.
[00:56:40.418 --> 00:56:42.079]  I just heard a disturbing rumor.
[00:56:42.079 --> 00:56:44.121]  What rumor is that?
[00:56:44.121 --> 00:56:51.407]  That you're authorizing the National Guard to set up detention facilities at convention centers and sports arenas in Los Angeles, Detroit, and Philadelphia.
[00:56:51.407 --> 00:56:53.969]  That's correct.
[00:56:53.969 --> 00:56:56.091]  That's against the President's order.
[00:56:56.091 --> 00:56:57.292]  I was there when he gave it.
[00:56:57.292 --> 00:56:58.753]  Karen, I know where you were.
[00:56:58.753 --> 00:57:01.955]  I was standing right next to you.
[00:57:01.955 --> 00:57:03.877]  To my knowledge, that order hasn't been rescinded.
[00:57:03.877 --> 00:57:06.619]  All right.
[00:57:06.619 --> 00:57:07.420]  You are confused.
[00:57:07.921 --> 00:57:10.104]  I haven't implemented anything yet.
[00:57:10.104 --> 00:57:11.586]  I'm merely positioning.
[00:57:11.586 --> 00:57:18.015]  If the President changes his mind, as I suspect he will, then we will have wasted less time.
[00:57:18.015 --> 00:57:19.437]  I'm not confused, Tom.
[00:57:19.437 --> 00:57:21.280]  And you can use whatever words you like.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.764]  In plain English, you're second-guessing the President.
[00:57:24.957 --> 00:57:25.697]  Alright.
[00:57:25.697 --> 00:57:25.757]  So...
[00:57:51.189 --> 00:57:55.431]  Here, we're also getting the idea that the President isn't for camps.
[00:57:55.431 --> 00:57:58.312]  Let me tell you, they've been building camps for 60 years.
[00:57:58.312 --> 00:58:00.672]  They got camps everywhere.
[00:58:00.672 --> 00:58:05.814]  Okay, we got 7 plus million Americans in the system from 1 million 10 years ago.
[00:58:05.814 --> 00:58:07.255]  Okay?
[00:58:07.255 --> 00:58:10.696]  I mean, they're arresting children that wet their pants who are retarded.
[00:58:10.696 --> 00:58:14.477]  They're arresting people that hug their teachers.
[00:58:14.477 --> 00:58:15.838]  Those are your camps, people!
[00:58:16.534 --> 00:58:17.235]  Okay?
[00:58:17.235 --> 00:58:25.461]  So they're setting the precedent that if there is an attack, we've got to have camps, and they're legitimizing their use.
[00:58:25.461 --> 00:58:27.683]  And there's so many other points.
[00:58:27.683 --> 00:58:29.604]  The ACLU is our savior.
[00:58:29.604 --> 00:58:31.946]  Folks, the ACLU is loyal opposition.
[00:58:31.946 --> 00:58:35.709]  They're there to create bad taste law, to drop the ball.
[00:58:35.709 --> 00:58:41.413]  Over and over again, they're totally infiltrated, and they also push for a lot of rights that don't exist.
[00:58:42.595 --> 00:58:48.796]  And so they can be marginalized as some far-left group, okay?
[00:58:48.796 --> 00:58:50.697]  It's unbelievable.
[00:58:50.697 --> 00:58:53.617]  Hey, you watch when all the camp stuff comes down.
[00:58:53.617 --> 00:58:57.638]  They're going to set the precedent like they always do with some minority group first.
[00:58:57.638 --> 00:58:58.818]  You'll be out there cheering them.
[00:58:58.818 --> 00:59:03.519]  And then they're going to set the precedent for the new jurisprudence.
[00:59:03.519 --> 00:59:06.860]  No Bill of Rights, no Constitution, and camps everywhere.
[00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:10.621]  By the way, they admit in the Houston Chronicle, these camps are for U.S.
[00:59:10.621 --> 00:59:11.301]  citizens too.
[00:59:11.954 --> 00:59:16.982]  During times of... uprising.

[00:59:29.325 --> 00:59:35.610]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:36.591]  Yeah.
[00:59:36.591 --> 00:59:38.372]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[00:59:38.372 --> 00:59:42.235]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[00:59:42.235 --> 00:59:44.177]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[00:59:44.177 --> 00:59:46.279]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[00:59:46.279 --> 00:59:48.020]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:49.521]  Honey, cheer up!
[00:59:49.521 --> 00:59:52.023]  I brought our Spark Berkey Purifiers!
[00:59:52.023 --> 00:59:52.784]  What?
[00:59:52.784 --> 01:00:00.369]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, so I packed Spark Berkey Purifiers!
[01:00:00.369 --> 01:00:05.213]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?

[01:00:20.878 --> 01:00:26.400]  Travel Berkey not available in Iowa.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.781]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:28.781 --> 01:00:31.522]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:38.106 --> 01:00:39.406]  Big Brother.
[01:00:39.406 --> 01:00:41.187]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:41.187 --> 01:00:42.948]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:42.948 --> 01:00:44.528]  You want answers?
[01:00:44.528 --> 01:00:45.429]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:45.429 --> 01:00:50.251]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:50.251 --> 01:00:55.433]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:55.433 --> 01:00:59.475]  I forgot to cover this part of the thousands of dead birds.
[01:00:59.475 --> 01:01:01.176]  No birds in a large area of Australia.
[01:01:01.176 --> 01:01:01.836]  They're all dead.
[01:01:02.819 --> 01:01:07.001]  They're now reporting that they were seen convulsing and flopping around on the ground.
[01:01:07.001 --> 01:01:10.722]  I'm sure whatever the government did, it was highly nutritious for everyone.
[01:01:10.722 --> 01:01:13.063]  I'm sure the government had nothing to do with this.
[01:01:13.063 --> 01:01:16.465]  And all their atmosphere weapons they've got.
[01:01:16.465 --> 01:01:19.806]  It's unbelievable.
[01:01:19.806 --> 01:01:24.268]  Kids kicked off buzz for speaking English.
[01:01:24.268 --> 01:01:25.489]  And this is in Florida.
[01:01:25.489 --> 01:01:28.030]  It is confirmed that in Texas,
[01:01:29.548 --> 01:01:40.899]  They are telling every major school district that they are going to start a new program with federal grants to make core curricula be taught in Spanish.
[01:01:40.899 --> 01:01:47.905]  Since it's not working too well to have everything taught in two languages, they're just going, no, you're going to speak Spanish!
[01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:50.547]  See?
[01:01:50.547 --> 01:01:53.130]  And by the way, Mexican troops are going to overrun your troops.
[01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:58.249]  And by the way, the average illegal's been arrested six times and never charged.
[01:01:58.249 --> 01:01:59.770]  Nothing's gonna happen.
[01:01:59.770 --> 01:02:06.372]  And by the way, we're gonna give illegal aliens housing loans and bank accounts with no ID.
[01:02:06.372 --> 01:02:08.773]  AP as well.
[01:02:08.773 --> 01:02:18.196]  But, Homeland Security's gonna mine all your data, and federal marshals have been ordered, air marshals, to put innocent people every month on lists just to create the illusion of threats.
[01:02:19.096 --> 01:02:21.397]  For looking out the window, taking photos, whatever.
[01:02:21.397 --> 01:02:22.758]  They've complained, so what?
[01:02:22.758 --> 01:02:23.899]  We're all going to be on list.
[01:02:23.899 --> 01:02:25.160]  We're all going to be surveilled.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.601]  We're going to have internal checkpoints.
[01:02:27.601 --> 01:02:28.742]  Feds are calling for that now.
[01:02:28.742 --> 01:02:31.884]  Just random troops searching you.
[01:02:31.884 --> 01:02:37.887]  And they've got shows like 24 out there conditioning everyone that this is what needs to happen.
[01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:40.449]  Acclimating you.
[01:02:40.449 --> 01:02:42.009]  Titrating the dose.
[01:02:42.009 --> 01:02:42.790]  Building it up.
[01:02:44.139 --> 01:02:45.941]  I mean, folks, I've been conditioned.
[01:02:45.941 --> 01:02:55.868]  Five years ago, if a top scientist or police chief or the head of a corporation said, everyone will have chips to buy and sell, I'd be on there freaking out, hyperventilating.
[01:02:55.868 --> 01:03:10.680]  I've seen probably 25 articles the last two weeks where, you know, the heads of universities, the head scientists, head doctors, top politicians are saying, yes, everyone will soon be forced to take a chip, and I'm not even covering it now.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.422]  You see, there's a science to this.
[01:03:13.863 --> 01:03:15.543]  That's why I said they'd probably leave us on air.
[01:03:15.543 --> 01:03:22.745]  We just sit here and cover all this, and yeah, you're informed, but we tend to emotionally get conditioned to accept it.
[01:03:22.745 --> 01:03:32.507]  I mean, you're not as freaked out now, whenever I get up on air and talk about a chip story.
[01:03:32.507 --> 01:03:39.348]  We ought to write an article about that, how it's just, in the span of five years, in the spate of five years, we've just all been conditioned.
[01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:42.249]  It's just, yeah, it's bad, yeah, but they're pushing for it.
[01:03:42.722 --> 01:03:48.867]  And then they're just going to tell our kids, oh, your old square parents, your old square grandparents, you know, they just don't know what's cool.
[01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:51.029]  Or, well, you've got to have this to work here.
[01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:52.530]  Nobody makes you work here.
[01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:57.915]  But, you know, this is the only jobs that are left now, you know, in the new police state.
[01:03:57.915 --> 01:03:59.676]  Well, you go to the head of the line if you've got the chip.
[01:03:59.676 --> 01:04:00.697]  They're already saying that.
[01:04:00.697 --> 01:04:03.900]  Oh, if you're a trusted traveler, you've got a green rating on your national ID.
[01:04:06.266 --> 01:04:07.747]  They're openly saying this!
[01:04:07.747 --> 01:04:08.408]  Do you understand?
[01:04:08.408 --> 01:04:15.853]  We're living in cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, bonker 1984!
[01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:31.084]  And I'm just some average country boy Texan, folks, from country stock, who just knew how to sit there in college, and here they were setting up a world government to take my freedoms, and then I went out and spoke out about it, and the media said, you're crazy, it doesn't exist, and I went, wait a minute, they're teaching it!
[01:04:31.084 --> 01:04:33.086]  No, no, just shut up and shut up!
[01:04:33.086 --> 01:04:34.687]  And I said, no, I'm not gonna shut up!
[01:04:35.313 --> 01:04:37.255]  I'm gonna fight you people!
[01:04:37.255 --> 01:04:53.168]  And then I found out they were behind Hitler, Stalin, Mao, they were behind cancer, in the vaccines, they were behind eugenics, they were behind all this stuff, and I just, and they write memos about how they can torture children, and they're just pure evil, and they brainwash us, and they laugh at us, and I'm sick of it!
[01:04:53.168 --> 01:05:03.617]  I don't want microchips, I don't want national ID cards, I don't want forced psychological testing, and every time some child breaks a finger at the playground in front of witnesses, CPS still tries to take them.
[01:05:05.211 --> 01:05:08.613]  I mean, this isn't freedom!
[01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:19.039]  Our listener's getting arrested from Kentucky to Washington for handing out Ron Paul videos in my videos, and it's in the paper, and I talk to the judge, and they go, yes, he should go to jail!
[01:05:19.039 --> 01:05:22.000]  I mean, what has our country turned into?
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.962]  We're not land of the free, home of the brave!
[01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:25.863]  We're a bunch of sick freaks!
[01:05:25.863 --> 01:05:26.943]  We're sick freaks!
[01:05:26.943 --> 01:05:27.844]  I'm sick!
[01:05:27.844 --> 01:05:30.105]  I've been conditioned to accept this!
[01:05:30.105 --> 01:05:31.606]  I'm not half as mad as I should be!
[01:05:36.861 --> 01:05:37.522]  It's here.
[01:05:37.522 --> 01:05:42.668]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:42.668 --> 01:05:50.316]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:50.993 --> 01:05:58.456]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:58.456 --> 01:06:10.181]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:06:10.181 --> 01:06:14.163]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:06:14.163 --> 01:06:16.404]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:06:16.404 --> 01:06:20.266]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:08:38.073 --> 01:08:39.374]  Big Brother.
[01:08:39.374 --> 01:08:41.135]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:41.135 --> 01:08:42.895]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:42.895 --> 01:08:43.676]  You want answers?
[01:08:44.486 --> 01:08:45.847]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:45.847 --> 01:08:50.210]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:50.210 --> 01:09:06.582]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:09:06.582 --> 01:09:09.184]  The Democrats are engaged in smoke and mirrors.
[01:09:09.184 --> 01:09:11.245]  They have been lobbied.
[01:09:11.245 --> 01:09:13.827]  Billions of dollars in the last couple years alone.
[01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:21.098]  To go along with the expansion and ongoing war in the Middle East of hegemon and domination?
[01:09:21.098 --> 01:09:22.519]  We'll be getting into that later.
[01:09:22.519 --> 01:09:24.141]  And again, you're seeing the headlines.
[01:09:24.141 --> 01:09:26.103]  Democrats are about to block Bush.
[01:09:26.103 --> 01:09:26.624]  No they're not.
[01:09:26.624 --> 01:09:28.446]  It's a non-binding resolution.
[01:09:28.446 --> 01:09:29.387]  It's smoke and mirrors.
[01:09:29.387 --> 01:09:32.531]  It's disgusting to watch them in action.
[01:09:34.017 --> 01:09:47.863]  And we will also get more into the domestic propaganda, open discussions of putting Americans in concentration camps, both on the news and then mirroring the news, the same unified propaganda on shows like 24.
[01:09:47.863 --> 01:09:56.287]  As you know, ladies and gentlemen, about a day and a half ago there was a huge airstrike all over Somalia, a group of airstrikes, and
[01:09:58.317 --> 01:10:00.599]  Different innocent civilians were killed.
[01:10:00.599 --> 01:10:06.724]  Between 200 and 400 are dead, according to different aid agencies that are neutral on the subject.
[01:10:06.724 --> 01:10:10.407]  Somali Hurs, hit by airstrikes.
[01:10:10.407 --> 01:10:11.828]  They're claiming they killed No.
[01:10:11.828 --> 01:10:12.548]  2 Al-Qaeda chief.
[01:10:12.548 --> 01:10:13.289]  They killed No.
[01:10:13.289 --> 01:10:15.991]  2 Al-Qaeda's no matter where they're bombing.
[01:10:15.991 --> 01:10:20.254]  They killed al-Zaqqari, what, 12 times?
[01:10:20.254 --> 01:10:21.315]  It's just a joke, folks.
[01:10:21.315 --> 01:10:22.556]  You can't believe any of this.
[01:10:22.556 --> 01:10:24.518]  Remember Private Lynch, Pat Tillman?
[01:10:25.445 --> 01:10:27.666]  The fake WMD fines.
[01:10:27.666 --> 01:10:28.167]  All of it!
[01:10:28.167 --> 01:10:31.728]  This is... Bush spent 1.8 billion.
[01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:32.709]  I keep saying 1.6.
[01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:34.010]  I looked it up the other day.
[01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:36.711]  It's 1.8 billion in fake news.
[01:10:36.711 --> 01:10:38.112]  Remember it ruled illegal?
[01:10:38.112 --> 01:10:42.294]  They admit they have sitcom posing as bloggers on the web, okay?
[01:10:42.294 --> 01:10:45.936]  I mean, this is... The military is actively lying to the American people.
[01:10:45.936 --> 01:10:47.877]  Totally illegal!
[01:10:47.877 --> 01:10:50.478]  This is not the United States of America!
[01:10:50.478 --> 01:10:51.699]  We have to recognize this!
[01:10:54.003 --> 01:10:59.124]  And we have Amira Woods, and her bio is extremely lengthy.
[01:10:59.124 --> 01:11:01.984]  We have links to it up on Infowars.com.
[01:11:01.984 --> 01:11:05.725]  She is an expert in the U.S.-Africa relations.
[01:11:05.725 --> 01:11:11.846]  Amira Woods is a co-director of the Foreign Policy and Focus at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C.
[01:11:11.846 --> 01:11:17.807]  Foreign Policy and Focus is an international network of more than 650 policy analysts and advocates seeking to make the U.S.
[01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:20.488]  a more reasonable global leader and a global partner.
[01:11:20.488 --> 01:11:22.248]  This is kind of the liberal arm of the New World Order.
[01:11:22.928 --> 01:11:33.222]  Uh, and it says, a foreign policy and focus is committed to advancing a citizen-based foreign policy agenda, one that is fundamentally rooted in citizen initiative and movements.
[01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:37.667]  And, uh, you know, she's got all the Harvard degrees and the rest of it and all the BBC, CNN.
[01:11:38.886 --> 01:11:52.876]  She has served as Program Manager for the Committee on Development Policy and Practice and Interaction, serving as a principal staff contact for advocacy at the UN, the International Financial Institutions, USAID, and the Treasury Department.
[01:11:52.876 --> 01:11:59.240]  She also previously served as a Program Officer at Oxfam, America's African Program, which involved outreach.
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:03.483]  She's also involved in the Woodrow Wilson School.
[01:12:04.728 --> 01:12:14.831]  At Princeton University, a Master's in Government from Harvard, an ABA in Political Economy and Government at Harvard, and we're honored to have Amira Woods on to tell us what's really going on in Somalia.
[01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:18.892]  A new war just kicked off, and whoever they attack is called Al-Qaeda.
[01:12:18.892 --> 01:12:19.912]  Thank you for coming on.
[01:12:19.912 --> 01:12:21.573]  Well, Alex, it's a pleasure to be with you.
[01:12:21.573 --> 01:12:26.354]  Thank you so much for making space in your show for this critical issue.
[01:12:26.354 --> 01:12:32.756]  You're right, it's a new war, this quote-unquote so-called global war on terror that sees Paris hiding under every rock.
[01:12:34.257 --> 01:12:39.111]  Taking on its latest front off the coast of Africa, East Africa, the Horn of Africa.
[01:12:40.068 --> 01:12:42.369]  Geostrategic location, Somalia.
[01:12:42.369 --> 01:12:58.436]  It is a country that throughout the Cold War was really the proxy war of both the USSR and the US, each pouring in weapons, taking turns pouring in weapons, making the country ungovernable.
[01:12:58.436 --> 01:13:01.577]  And it has been ungovernable, really, for the last 15 years.
[01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:05.119]  Until about six months ago, when some measure of stability
[01:13:05.539 --> 01:13:12.004]  Yeah, they're not going to let the Somali people have billions and billions in oil and natural gas revenue.
[01:13:28.161 --> 01:13:44.055]  Well, the issue really with Somalia, and it has been an issue for decades now, is its positioning right there where, you know, close to the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, all of international shipping flows off these vital shores off the Somali border.
[01:13:44.475 --> 01:13:52.417]  Plus, Somalia does have resources, natural resources, oil, like much of the Horn of Africa, really.
[01:13:52.417 --> 01:13:56.358]  These richly endowed countries are seeing the U.S.
[01:13:56.358 --> 01:13:58.638]  looking with its addiction to oil.
[01:13:58.638 --> 01:14:10.201]  The Bush administration is looking wherever it can to feed that addiction to oil and controlling these vital resources, just as the case with Iraq is exactly what the Bush administration is about.
[01:14:10.761 --> 01:14:15.324]  In Somalia as well.
[01:14:15.324 --> 01:14:27.690]  For those that just joined us, why don't you recap, because there's been scant attention to this, what really happened, how many airstrikes there were, how many from the different groups you've talked to are really dead, you're an expert on Africa, especially the Horn, that's why we have you here.
[01:14:27.690 --> 01:14:34.874]  What's really going on and who they really killed, because obviously whoever they killed, they claim is Al-Qaeda, just like they claim Saddam had WMDs.
[01:14:35.194 --> 01:14:36.055]  Exactly, Alex.
[01:14:36.055 --> 01:14:48.947]  Let's remember, this is the same intelligence unit that told us there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, that told us the Iraqi people would welcome with joyful arms the American people and that America would win hearts and minds so easily in Iraq.
[01:14:48.947 --> 01:14:54.532]  It's the very same intelligence that now is saying that nine years after the fact, okay?
[01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:57.735]  Nine years ago, three people went into hiding in Somalia.
[01:14:58.115 --> 01:15:08.118]  And that they have launched aerial bombardments for three days now to seek and kill those three people who nine years ago may have gone into hiding in Somalia.
[01:15:08.118 --> 01:15:11.419]  This is, once again, flawed intelligence.
[01:15:11.419 --> 01:15:15.280]  It is foreign policy based on lies.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.421]  It is an irresponsible act of war.
[01:15:17.921 --> 01:15:22.686]  Well, let's go back to 89.
[01:15:22.686 --> 01:15:31.754]  They claim that two American students have been kidnapped, and I have the Panama Deception, I have the video, where they go, no one kidnapped us, suddenly U.S.
[01:15:31.754 --> 01:15:40.903]  troops showed up to, quote, protect us, we appreciate the protection, it was totally made up, so they'll claim two women have been kidnapped, three Al Qaeda have gone to the country of millions,
[01:15:41.523 --> 01:15:46.045]  And really, they're just mad that the Somalis beat the U.S.
[01:15:46.045 --> 01:15:47.045]  and the U.N.
[01:15:47.045 --> 01:15:58.250]  when they were in there before, and I certainly don't like images of dead and dying Americans being brought around, but these people have been... No, but essentially they're seeing Islam as like the Red Scare all over again, right?
[01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:00.931]  Well, it's an excuse to go in and blow it back into the Stone Age.
[01:16:00.931 --> 01:16:01.872]  You know what's going on.
[01:16:01.872 --> 01:16:03.332]  Well, this is the problem.
[01:16:03.332 --> 01:16:05.933]  Somalia is a country that is 95% Islamic.
[01:16:07.894 --> 01:16:12.421]  Now, clearly the Union of Islamic States, they brought a measure of security.
[01:16:12.421 --> 01:16:19.572]  If the Somali people want to choose their leaders, it's for them to decide, not for the U.S.
[01:16:19.572 --> 01:16:20.654]  or for the Soviet Union.
[01:16:23.858 --> 01:16:27.639]  A leader group was that had displaced the warlords and was bringing stability.
[01:16:27.639 --> 01:16:29.960]  You can't have that with Slobodan Milosevic.
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.640]  You can't have that with Saddam.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.721]  Anybody who brings stabilization is knocked off.
[01:16:33.721 --> 01:16:40.542]  We understand the strategy of keeping the third world in total slavery through economics, but please go over it for us.
[01:16:40.542 --> 01:16:41.563]  So there were two sides.
[01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:46.464]  There was one side of the warlords who for the last 15 years have created havoc in the country, right?
[01:16:46.824 --> 01:16:47.465]  We're good to go.
[01:17:02.526 --> 01:17:08.511]  That formed a collective body that actually created a national body.
[01:17:08.511 --> 01:17:14.676]  So this is a group actually fighting against the warlords, the people that killed our troops.
[01:17:14.676 --> 01:17:19.440]  So our government comes in and blows up the people that have taken over from the people that were killing our troops.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:26.586]  And essentially what we have now is this transitional government that's been propped into place by the Ethiopian troops and the U.S.
[01:17:26.586 --> 01:17:27.067]  bombers
[01:17:27.547 --> 01:17:35.553]  It is that transitional government that is made up of the remnants of these former warlords, right?
[01:17:35.553 --> 01:17:37.875]  So we have the warlords coming back!
[01:17:37.875 --> 01:17:42.139]  And they've been escorted in, red-carpeted in, by the U.S.
[01:17:42.139 --> 01:17:44.000]  through this aerial bombardment campaign.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.463]  And what we're really worried about is that you have four U.S.
[01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:50.665]  battleships off the coast of Somalia.
[01:17:50.665 --> 01:17:52.346]  You have reports of U.S.
[01:17:52.346 --> 01:17:54.168]  quote-unquote training going on.
[01:17:54.688 --> 01:17:59.191]  Not only in Kenya and Ethiopia, but likely U.S.
[01:17:59.191 --> 01:18:01.972]  ground presence even in Somalia itself.
[01:18:01.972 --> 01:18:09.597]  What we're concerned about is that there will be an ongoing occupation of Somalia, as has happened in Iraq.
[01:18:09.597 --> 01:18:14.040]  We have not, the Bush administration has not learned any lessons from Iraq.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.341]  They have launched yet another preemptive war.
[01:18:16.921 --> 01:18:26.523]  And they have, right now, opened the door to an ongoing occupation, leaving the Somali people in even more crisis than they have been in the last two decades.
[01:18:26.523 --> 01:18:32.025]  How are Somalis reacting to this, from what you've gleaned from your sources and country?
[01:18:32.025 --> 01:18:33.605]  I mean, how are they seeing this?
[01:18:33.605 --> 01:18:37.446]  Well, first of all, the Somalis are seeing their long-time rival, the Ethiopians.
[01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:40.807]  The Ethiopians started the campaign on behalf of the U.S.
[01:18:41.167 --> 01:18:48.431]  So the long-time rivals of Somalia, they share a border, they have fought over the lines of that border for decades now.
[01:18:48.431 --> 01:19:03.318]  So it's the Ethiopian troops that have come in and basically maintained a presence to lay the groundwork for this transitional federal government that was outside of Somalia to actually come into the country.
[01:19:03.318 --> 01:19:07.900]  So it's a government that is seen as getting its credibility because of the existence of
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:08.881]  I think so.
[01:19:23.977 --> 01:19:24.818]  The U.S.
[01:19:24.818 --> 01:19:36.811]  trying to assert itself through this preemptive strike is going to create the very thing it's created in Iraq, which is a haven for more chaos, a haven for more instability, and a haven for more insecurity.
[01:19:36.811 --> 01:19:39.915]  Well, that's the global Balkans that Brzezinski talks about.
[01:19:39.915 --> 01:19:44.300]  They want to destabilize the world and have them locked in ethnic and religious tension.
[01:19:45.097 --> 01:19:54.062]  Well, it seems to be, you know, if you're going to use this mask of, you know, Islamic extremists all around the world attacking America, when actually it is the U.S.
[01:19:54.062 --> 01:20:04.167]  that has launched this preemptive attack and that is now likely to occupy, you know, an Islamic state.
[01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:10.070]  I mean, this is the recipe for disaster, not only for Somalia, but for the region and for the world.
[01:20:10.777 --> 01:20:15.160]  I want to break down for the listeners again exactly who the players are, when this kicked off.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:18.562]  Notice no one was told, it's just a new war.
[01:20:18.562 --> 01:20:21.343]  And the average good ol' boy will say, good, get them Somalis.
[01:20:21.343 --> 01:20:28.327]  No, no, our government is helping the people that killed the troops under Clinton.
[01:20:28.327 --> 01:20:32.570]  You understand folks, they don't want those people getting up on their own feet.
[01:20:33.968 --> 01:20:39.334]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:47.684]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:20:47.684 --> 01:20:54.752]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:20:54.872 --> 01:20:55.832]  We're good to go!

[01:21:37.615 --> 01:21:45.720]  Did you know that Senate committee investigations in the 1960s called the international communist movement the greatest conspiracy the world has ever witnessed?
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:53.745]  They said the communists had infiltrated into high government offices in the State Department and also advisors to presidents.
[01:21:54.750 --> 01:22:02.995]  Did you know that the Communist infiltration successfully stopped all FBI investigations into their secret activities?

[01:22:31.132 --> 01:22:39.978]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:22:39.978 --> 01:22:45.002]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:22:45.002 --> 01:22:47.764]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:22:47.764 --> 01:22:48.865]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:22:50.214 --> 01:22:55.738]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:22:55.738 --> 01:23:04.003]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:23:04.003 --> 01:23:07.305]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:23:07.305 --> 01:23:13.669]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[01:23:27.513 --> 01:23:32.874]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:32.874 --> 01:23:35.354]  Attention, attention everyone!
[01:23:35.354 --> 01:23:37.895]  A brand new invention just released.
[01:23:37.895 --> 01:23:42.576]  It's called Wristease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[01:23:43.254 --> 01:23:50.619]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.

[01:24:03.929 --> 01:24:08.373]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.

[01:24:44.304 --> 01:24:49.030]  Expert on Africa, particularly Somalia.
[01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:51.773]  Advises our own government and many others.
[01:24:53.214 --> 01:25:03.121]  In the last four or five minutes we have left, just recap who the groups are, what the strikes have really been on, and, I mean, all this is doing is destroying the government.
[01:25:03.121 --> 01:25:06.043]  They claim, though, they're going after three Al-Qaeda members.
[01:25:06.043 --> 01:25:07.524]  This is extremely transparent.
[01:25:07.524 --> 01:25:08.865]  Break it down for us.
[01:25:08.865 --> 01:25:10.066]  So the two sides.
[01:25:10.066 --> 01:25:12.868]  On one end is the Union of Islamic Courts.
[01:25:13.789 --> 01:25:18.013]  And they have been in place since about June, bringing stability.
[01:25:18.013 --> 01:25:21.576]  Women could walk in the streets without threat of being raped.
[01:25:21.576 --> 01:25:27.761]  Schools were opened, hospitals, clinics were opened again for the first time in almost 15 years.
[01:25:27.761 --> 01:25:28.962]  That's on one end.
[01:25:28.962 --> 01:25:31.424]  On the other end are these remnant warlords.
[01:25:31.424 --> 01:25:38.390]  They've been around, different versions of them, for the last 15 years, controlling their own clans and subclans.
[01:25:38.997 --> 01:25:43.639]  And they formed a transitional federal government in Nairobi.
[01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:44.840]  They weren't even in Somalia.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:47.381]  They were in Nairobi, formed a government.
[01:25:47.381 --> 01:25:51.603]  That government was not able to even enter Somalia until this very week.
[01:25:52.133 --> 01:26:09.451]  Okay, even though they've been formed now for quite some time, they weren't able to even enter the country until this week because of bombings by the U.S., because of troops from Ethiopia that have chosen sides, have picked one side versus the other.
[01:26:09.451 --> 01:26:12.374]  So what you have is under this mask
[01:26:12.854 --> 01:26:21.018]  Of global war on terror, you have the Bush administration trying to decide for the Somali people who should be their leaders.
[01:26:21.018 --> 01:26:25.339]  This is something that Americans would never stand for.
[01:26:25.339 --> 01:26:32.402]  Americans at the time of the revolution tossed out the king and said, we have to choose our own leaders here in the United States, right?
[01:26:32.402 --> 01:26:36.464]  This is the very right that Somalis and everyone around the world
[01:26:36.924 --> 01:26:37.705]  Well, this is a thing.
[01:26:37.705 --> 01:26:40.769]  The Bush administration wants to make sure that there is a clear path
[01:26:53.983 --> 01:27:01.566]  For companies, for corporations, especially we know the influence of oil companies in this administration.
[01:27:01.566 --> 01:27:19.072]  So when these oil companies are looking increasingly to Africa for a source of oil to feed their oil addiction, they are looking more and more to East Africa, the Horn of Africa, all the regions from Sudan all the way to Somalia that have reports of oil under their soil.
[01:27:19.572 --> 01:27:22.453]  It is an effort to control territory.
[01:27:22.453 --> 01:27:24.733]  It is an effort to control resources.
[01:27:24.733 --> 01:27:28.194]  This is the source of the conflict today.
[01:27:28.194 --> 01:27:34.895]  It is not so-called war on terror, finding three people who nine years ago went into hiding in Somalia.
[01:27:34.895 --> 01:27:36.996]  That is the guide, that is the mask.
[01:27:36.996 --> 01:27:45.158]  We have to unmask it and say the reality is this Bush administration is all about preemptive strike for regime change.
[01:27:45.158 --> 01:27:47.238]  And let's be specific about what they're striking.
[01:27:47.961 --> 01:27:51.264]  They are striking Somali civilians for the most part.
[01:27:51.264 --> 01:27:52.546]  This is what we have heard.
[01:27:52.546 --> 01:27:57.951]  AP has reported 31 people killed, including a four-year-old child.
[01:27:57.951 --> 01:27:58.992]  A four-year-old child.
[01:27:58.992 --> 01:28:01.474]  This is not any kind of operative, right?
[01:28:01.474 --> 01:28:05.218]  These are innocent women and children, innocent Somalis,
[01:28:05.658 --> 01:28:09.200]  Well, the thing is, there are no reports coming out of the Pentagon.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.282]  These are all eyewitness figures and statistics coming out since the Ethiopian started.
[01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:34.397]  You know, so for the last three weeks now, with this launch of the offensive, again, the Ethiopians, the proxies of the Bush administration started this off.
[01:28:34.397 --> 01:28:39.842]  The reports are that at least a thousand Somalis have been killed, right?
[01:28:39.842 --> 01:28:43.445]  But with the actual aerial bombardments, the numbers are unknown.
[01:28:43.445 --> 01:28:50.651]  So let's be clear, they've got the Ethiopians, they've got the original Muslim warlords, who are remnants of the same groups.
[01:28:52.859 --> 01:29:00.186]  You were involved in killing our troops, and now, as usual, the globalists are siding with them to go in against the stable government.
[01:29:00.186 --> 01:29:00.666]  Exactly.
[01:29:00.666 --> 01:29:06.291]  So the government that the people chose themselves, that's the regime that we have to change, right?
[01:29:06.291 --> 01:29:10.795]  And impose... Are there any connections to that government and to Adid and all them?
[01:29:11.599 --> 01:29:15.541]  Are there any connections to that Islamic government?
[01:29:15.541 --> 01:29:33.430]  The transitional governing body, the one that was put in place in Nairobi, in the neighboring country, and just brought into Somalia this week, that one has ties to not only the Aidid faction, but to other warring factions, warlords.
[01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:35.571]  So to be clear, let's be clear, the people
[01:29:39.824 --> 01:29:52.159]  The people who also have terrorized their own people, have terrorized their own citizenry, are the ones being backed by Bush.
[01:29:52.159 --> 01:29:53.721]  But they're going to keep the people down?
[01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:56.264]  They're going to make sure Africans never get any of their wealth?
[01:29:56.264 --> 01:29:59.288]  The gold, the diamonds, the oil, the gas, they never get any of it?
[01:29:59.855 --> 01:30:03.638]  This is the thing, Africa is projected as poor, it is actually very wealthy.
[01:30:03.638 --> 01:30:11.845]  The problem is, the resources need to be used for the benefit of the people, and right now the Bush administration is standing actually against the Somali people.
[01:30:11.845 --> 01:30:15.828]  Are there any websites we can visit that'll give us more info?
[01:30:15.828 --> 01:30:21.873]  Please, fpif, foreign policy in focus, fpif.org is our website.
[01:30:21.873 --> 01:30:24.035]  We got a break, thank you so much.
[01:30:24.035 --> 01:30:26.958]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:27.956 --> 01:30:33.941]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:33.941 --> 01:30:34.722]  It's a fact.
[01:30:34.722 --> 01:30:39.606]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:30:39.606 --> 01:30:45.090]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:48.553]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[01:30:48.553 --> 01:30:55.659]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:30:55.999 --> 01:31:03.621]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:31:03.621 --> 01:31:05.922]  We also do credit restoration.
[01:31:05.922 --> 01:31:12.484]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[01:31:12.484 --> 01:31:16.225]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[01:31:16.605 --> 01:31:19.226]  Call Day of Jubilee, open 9 a.m.
[01:31:19.226 --> 01:31:20.107]  to 5 p.m.
[01:31:20.107 --> 01:31:21.387]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[01:31:21.387 --> 01:31:21.587]  That's 920-293-8024.
[01:31:21.587 --> 01:31:22.288]  And ask for Robert.
[01:31:22.288 --> 01:31:23.908]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:31:23.908 --> 01:31:25.309]  Shelly, you look... Oh, wait.
[01:31:25.309 --> 01:31:26.569]  Why did you turn that down?
[01:31:37.154 --> 01:31:39.855]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[01:31:39.855 --> 01:31:44.517]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[01:31:44.517 --> 01:31:47.198]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[01:31:47.198 --> 01:31:48.418]  I could use something like that.
[01:31:48.418 --> 01:31:53.920]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night, and you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.821]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[01:31:55.821 --> 01:31:58.462]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[01:31:58.462 --> 01:31:59.482]  I guess you're right.
[01:31:59.482 --> 01:32:00.322]  Why don't we try it?
[01:32:00.322 --> 01:32:02.283]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[01:32:02.703 --> 01:32:07.425]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[01:32:07.425 --> 01:32:09.186]  I know where we can get some more information.
[01:32:09.186 --> 01:32:13.768]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.

[01:33:53.516 --> 01:33:59.521]  I can see the day coming when even your whole diaper's gonna be in your arm.
[01:34:13.655 --> 01:34:24.418]  Yeah, we got it in the way.
[01:34:24.418 --> 01:34:34.260]  Democracy don't rule the world, you better get that in your head.
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:39.482]  This world is ruled by violence, but I guess that's better left unread.
[01:34:57.277 --> 01:34:58.878]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:58.878 --> 01:35:00.738]  Glad that you joined us today.
[01:35:00.738 --> 01:35:07.900]  We've got Aaron Russo scheduled in the next hour from Houston, Texas, where he's undergoing ongoing cancer treatment.
[01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:11.901]  It hasn't really been a secret, but he hadn't publicized it.
[01:35:11.901 --> 01:35:14.202]  That's why you haven't heard him on talk radio the last month or so.
[01:35:15.490 --> 01:35:22.992]  He'll be joining us to talk about Solutions, his new film, and his own personal four-plus year battle with cancer.
[01:35:22.992 --> 01:35:27.534]  But I want to make some calls, a few calls in this hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:35:27.534 --> 01:35:27.594]  800-259-9231.
[01:35:27.594 --> 01:35:31.335]  People say that so fast they can't hear it.
[01:35:31.335 --> 01:35:31.435]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:35:31.435 --> 01:35:31.995]  There you go.
[01:35:31.995 --> 01:35:33.676]  Websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:46.095 --> 01:35:50.179]  As well as JonesReport.com and Infowars.net.
[01:35:50.179 --> 01:35:58.205]  I had, since two days ago, when they struck Somalia, I had probably read 20, 30 articles.
[01:35:58.205 --> 01:35:59.567]  I'd done some background checking.
[01:35:59.567 --> 01:36:06.012]  I looked at who had taken control of Somalia.
[01:36:06.012 --> 01:36:07.994]  We contacted some experts.
[01:36:07.994 --> 01:36:13.759]  We got one of the leading experts on Somalia on for you, just in the last segment.
[01:36:15.763 --> 01:36:24.811]  And the interview just confirmed what I had already seen, what was already admitted in, you know, page 3.
[01:36:24.811 --> 01:36:37.121]  You have to read through 10-15 paragraphs to find them, and admit that the same warlords with I.D., the same characters that he led, were waiting outside the country.
[01:36:37.121 --> 01:36:38.562]  They'd been basically driven from the nation.
[01:36:38.562 --> 01:36:42.485]  They'd been defeated by stabilizing Muslim influence.
[01:36:42.485 --> 01:36:43.366]  They're all Muslims, too.
[01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:51.029]  And that they were working with the Ethiopians to come back into the country and take it over.
[01:36:51.029 --> 01:36:53.870]  And then to keep it in warlord squalor.
[01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:56.251]  They want to keep Afghanistan in squalor divided.
[01:36:56.251 --> 01:36:58.272]  They want to keep Iraq in squalor divided.
[01:36:58.272 --> 01:37:01.493]  They want to bust up Iran and keep them in squalor divided.
[01:37:01.493 --> 01:37:06.776]  They don't like shopping malls and space probes and nuclear plants, folks.
[01:37:06.776 --> 01:37:13.779]  These people all have trillions of dollars in resources and they literally run around in caveman-level technology.
[01:37:15.774 --> 01:37:18.855]  And they weren't previously.
[01:37:18.855 --> 01:37:20.175]  They weren't like this previously.
[01:37:20.175 --> 01:37:21.256]  That's the thing.
[01:37:21.256 --> 01:37:24.537]  Somalis weren't backward previously.
[01:37:24.537 --> 01:37:26.557]  The Iranians aren't backward.
[01:37:26.557 --> 01:37:27.798]  The Iraqis weren't backward.
[01:37:27.798 --> 01:37:30.238]  They are now, extremely backward.
[01:37:30.238 --> 01:37:33.339]  And even Afghanistan had built up quite a bit, but not anymore.
[01:37:33.339 --> 01:37:39.241]  It is like Planet of the Apes or something, and after the fall of civilization.
[01:37:39.241 --> 01:37:40.682]  I mean, this is bad.
[01:37:43.981 --> 01:37:48.585]  And yesterday I did, in the car, listen to some Neocon Talk Radio.
[01:37:48.585 --> 01:37:49.806]  There were celebrations.
[01:37:49.806 --> 01:37:51.208]  There was chess beating.
[01:37:51.208 --> 01:37:53.910]  Everyone was feeling very manly.
[01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:56.972]  Most of them cannot find the Horn of Africa.
[01:37:56.972 --> 01:38:00.295]  Most of them know nothing about its history.
[01:38:00.295 --> 01:38:01.977]  And, I mean, literally, they can't find it.
[01:38:01.977 --> 01:38:02.898]  They know nothing about it.
[01:38:02.898 --> 01:38:04.259]  They just know.
[01:38:04.259 --> 01:38:05.340]  And I heard the callers.
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:06.140]  I heard the host.
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:07.682]  And I said, let me guess.
[01:38:07.682 --> 01:38:08.442]  I'll flip around.
[01:38:08.442 --> 01:38:09.163]  This is what I heard.
[01:38:10.015 --> 01:38:16.301]  Actually, yesterday morning, yesterday afternoon, and driving home last night at 11.
[01:38:16.301 --> 01:38:18.042]  And it was about Somalia.
[01:38:18.042 --> 01:38:20.304]  Man, we finally got them back.
[01:38:20.304 --> 01:38:31.614]  These are the Al-Qaeda people, this is what they were saying, that shot down our helicopters back under Bill Clinton in the early 1990s.
[01:38:31.614 --> 01:38:34.256]  Blackhawk down all the rest of it.
[01:38:34.256 --> 01:38:36.298]  Now, I, of course, knew
[01:38:37.908 --> 01:38:59.238]  That, quote, Al-Qaeda, as we've heard of it, had nothing to do with fights between one of the main warlords in Mogadishu and the Army Rangers and the U.N.
[01:38:59.238 --> 01:39:02.539]  forces in some of the ground trips.
[01:39:02.539 --> 01:39:03.540]  Nothing to do with it.
[01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:05.141]  I mean, that's mainstream history.
[01:39:05.141 --> 01:39:06.001]  No one said they did.
[01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:09.012]  Not by the time it hits talk radio.
[01:39:09.012 --> 01:39:13.214]  And I want you to consciously get this beamed into your brain, what I'm talking about right now.
[01:39:13.214 --> 01:39:15.075]  Understand.
[01:39:15.075 --> 01:39:16.016]  And you've heard it.
[01:39:16.016 --> 01:39:17.037]  You're talk radio listeners.
[01:39:17.037 --> 01:39:18.097]  I'm sure you've heard it.
[01:39:18.097 --> 01:39:23.040]  We finally got Al-Qaeda back, who hit us in the early 90's.
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:25.962]  It's not true, but so what?
[01:39:25.962 --> 01:39:29.084]  Now they claim three guys, and now they claim they've captured one.
[01:39:29.084 --> 01:39:29.845]  Of course, they're British.
[01:39:29.845 --> 01:39:30.585]  It's always the same.
[01:39:30.585 --> 01:39:32.727]  MI6 types.
[01:39:35.464 --> 01:39:40.325]  Probably spies the whole time just gathering data under the guise of being Al Qaeda.
[01:39:40.325 --> 01:39:41.885]  Who knows, though, when you get lied to this much.
[01:39:41.885 --> 01:39:53.468]  But what we do know is, our government is working with the people who did shoot down those helicopters, and who did drag dead U.S.
[01:39:53.468 --> 01:39:56.268]  servicemen to the streets.
[01:39:56.268 --> 01:40:00.209]  Period.
[01:40:00.209 --> 01:40:03.910]  As you just heard our guest cover, and that's admitted again in the back of the paper if you know where to read.
[01:40:07.146 --> 01:40:08.988]  But does that stop people right now?
[01:40:08.988 --> 01:40:14.032]  They're probably pulling into the Walmart to buy some more plastic flags right now.
[01:40:14.032 --> 01:40:17.534]  I mean, they're feeling real good right now.
[01:40:17.534 --> 01:40:20.417]  Boy, we finally got them.
[01:40:20.417 --> 01:40:23.979]  Because this is their extended manliness.
[01:40:23.979 --> 01:40:28.423]  They just know there's some black people they're blowing up, and they can't find it.
[01:40:28.423 --> 01:40:29.344]  They don't know where it is.
[01:40:30.399 --> 01:40:33.381]  They just heard Al-Qaeda got blow up yesterday.
[01:40:33.381 --> 01:40:38.344]  It's the same Al-Qaeda that hit our people.
[01:40:38.344 --> 01:40:41.005]  Folks, I can do a good ol' boy's southerner voice.
[01:40:41.005 --> 01:40:42.886]  I have trouble with the Yankee voice.
[01:40:42.886 --> 01:40:45.628]  I was actually listening to Sean Hannity yesterday and it was more like this.
[01:40:45.628 --> 01:40:46.909]  Oh, Sean!
[01:40:46.909 --> 01:40:48.750]  It's great, Sean!
[01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:51.071]  We finally got Al-Qaeda back!
[01:40:51.071 --> 01:40:54.413]  We're taking it to them for what they did to our troops!
[01:40:55.954 --> 01:40:56.294]  I know.
[01:40:56.294 --> 01:40:56.634]  Thank you.
[01:40:56.634 --> 01:40:57.575]  You're a great American.
[01:40:57.575 --> 01:40:57.855]  I know.
[01:40:57.855 --> 01:40:58.956]  Isn't it wonderful?
[01:40:58.956 --> 01:40:59.696]  Oh, man.
[01:40:59.696 --> 01:41:00.697]  You're a great American.
[01:41:00.697 --> 01:41:00.917]  I know.
[01:41:00.917 --> 01:41:01.977]  This is top of leadership.
[01:41:01.977 --> 01:41:03.098]  Top of president we need.
[01:41:03.098 --> 01:41:04.739]  He's not screwing up like Clinton did.
[01:41:04.739 --> 01:41:09.141]  He's really taking it to Al-Qaeda that killed our troops and drug them to the streets.
[01:41:09.141 --> 01:41:11.442]  It's fairytale!
[01:41:11.442 --> 01:41:21.888]  Treacherously, our criminal government is trying to bring the people back in who will keep them in quagmire and will keep them down instead of them getting a legitimate government that brings order.
[01:41:23.473 --> 01:41:24.414]  Period!
[01:41:24.414 --> 01:41:26.935]  I mean, how stupid do you feel?
[01:41:26.935 --> 01:41:28.335]  I know you're listening right now.
[01:41:28.335 --> 01:41:32.217]  Those of you that are neocon followers, you don't care!
[01:41:32.217 --> 01:41:34.579]  You'll just go, whatever, commie!
[01:41:34.579 --> 01:41:36.580]  Please, will you check out the claims we just made?
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:37.100]  They're true.
[01:41:37.100 --> 01:41:48.846]  And then after it's been proven to them, they'll just say, well, that's war, you gotta make deals and people... It's just, I mean, you like being idiots.
[01:41:48.846 --> 01:41:50.407]  You like always being con.
[01:41:50.407 --> 01:41:53.128]  You like always having somebody run game on you.
[01:41:55.043 --> 01:41:56.964]  You like being played!
[01:41:56.964 --> 01:42:01.966]  And I don't understand it!
[01:42:01.966 --> 01:42:07.489]  Running game on the sheeple!
[01:42:07.489 --> 01:42:10.650]  And I'm tired of it!
[01:42:10.650 --> 01:42:11.891]  You're not members of the elite.
[01:42:11.891 --> 01:42:13.112]  You're not in the power structure.
[01:42:13.112 --> 01:42:20.055]  All these good ol' boys, while America's being destroyed, are driving around going, I love W. Oh man, he's good.
[01:42:20.055 --> 01:42:21.736]  What are you talking about?
[01:42:21.736 --> 01:42:24.377]  George Bush is a total puppet butchering the country.
[01:42:26.497 --> 01:42:28.619]  He's better than Hillary!
[01:42:28.619 --> 01:42:31.661]  The Ripper Murdoch's financing the witch!
[01:42:31.661 --> 01:42:33.202]  They've been meeting for years!
[01:42:33.202 --> 01:42:37.706]  It's all staged!
[01:42:37.706 --> 01:42:41.769]  As Roosevelt said, anything that happens in politics is planned to happen that way.
[01:42:41.769 --> 01:42:42.869]  It's too important.
[01:42:42.869 --> 01:42:44.771]  The big moves are all staged, folks.
[01:42:46.679 --> 01:42:49.280]  And, uh, I don't know what... I think I know what this is.
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:50.981]  I mean, that government's been in for a few months.
[01:42:50.981 --> 01:43:02.685]  They've built up this offensive, and they've timed it, knowing that this will get us some kind of bump in war fever, somehow psychologically associating it with what happened, dragging our troops to the streets.
[01:43:02.685 --> 01:43:07.467]  And then they somehow shift that over to Iran, with all these carrier task forces out there.
[01:43:07.467 --> 01:43:12.608]  This is like an hors d'oeuvre or something.
[01:43:12.608 --> 01:43:13.869]  To the main entree.
[01:43:16.934 --> 01:43:19.796]  I don't know.
[01:43:19.796 --> 01:43:21.958]  I don't know.
[01:43:21.958 --> 01:43:23.379]  You're on in the Netherlands.
[01:43:23.379 --> 01:43:24.080]  You're on the air.
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:24.781]  Thanks for holding.
[01:43:24.781 --> 01:43:26.962]  Hi, Alex.
[01:43:26.962 --> 01:43:27.603]  Yes.
[01:43:27.603 --> 01:43:29.985]  Nice to be on your show.
[01:43:29.985 --> 01:43:35.990]  I've got a lot of questions for you, but I'm only going to ask a few.
[01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:39.713]  Let's get back to the Van Allen belt you talked about in the first hour.
[01:43:39.713 --> 01:43:42.115]  Well, I was talking about how
[01:43:42.907 --> 01:43:56.211]  How our magnetic field, how the atmosphere, the 25 or 30 feet of water, if you can mention it all, that's in the atmosphere, blocks us from the rays generated from the sun.
[01:43:56.211 --> 01:43:59.472]  Is it also true that it contains a lot of radiation itself?
[01:43:59.472 --> 01:44:00.533]  Yes.
[01:44:00.533 --> 01:44:08.455]  So, you have a banner on the bottom of your website from Barts Eye Braille?
[01:44:09.366 --> 01:44:11.853]  Do you endorse his product too?
[01:44:11.853 --> 01:44:12.835]  His claims?
[01:44:12.835 --> 01:44:14.399]  You know, here's the deal.
[01:44:14.399 --> 01:44:17.207]  Our advertising is pretty cheap, and I do turn down about 90% of it.
[01:44:18.531 --> 01:44:29.655]  And I don't know, and if you want to get down to brass tacks, I don't know about that subject, and so some advertising goes past me, and then later I remove it.
[01:44:29.655 --> 01:44:37.137]  I'm kind of neutral on it, and I don't know how I feel on that, because it's such a complex issue.
[01:44:37.137 --> 01:44:42.439]  And the whole discussion is, can a spacecraft from limited shielding go through the Van Allen radiation belt?
[01:44:43.279 --> 01:44:53.103]  And most people, experts and engineers I've talked to, have been involved at NASA measuring, and people I know and trust, say that it isn't good for you, but yeah, you can go through it.
[01:44:53.103 --> 01:44:53.923]  Oh, okay.
[01:44:53.923 --> 01:45:10.429]  Because I was figuring out that they're planning our next trip to the moon, and probably the only way, well, if it didn't happen in 69, the only way now to do it is to put a spaceship, piece by piece, with shielding,
[01:45:11.558 --> 01:45:25.220]  Yeah, you build them in space at an assembly or a coupling point like Legos, and then they put them up on five or six big booster pieces up there.
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:31.141]  And they need a large lead shielding or they need about ten feet of water around them to not have damage.
[01:45:31.141 --> 01:45:35.962]  But the astronauts did report, you know, they close their eyes and see white when they went through the belt.
[01:45:35.962 --> 01:45:37.663]  Yeah, space shuttle astronauts, yeah.
[01:45:37.663 --> 01:45:39.263]  Well, they all get radiated routinely, yeah.
[01:45:40.231 --> 01:45:43.301]  Okay, so that's still an open question for you.
[01:45:43.301 --> 01:45:44.665]  It is an open question for me.
[01:45:44.665 --> 01:45:45.808]  You know, it's like, um...
[01:45:47.170 --> 01:45:49.892]  I think we took a sponsor up there, some Ph.D.
[01:45:49.892 --> 01:45:53.494]  who wrote a thing about radiation at the towers and were there nukes?
[01:45:53.494 --> 01:45:55.335]  I don't tend to think there was.
[01:45:55.335 --> 01:45:59.598]  But, you know, at a certain point, I want people to be able to get their info out.
[01:45:59.598 --> 01:46:00.459]  I don't know anymore.
[01:46:00.459 --> 01:46:13.147]  I mean, that's the problem with my job is I have to manage all this stuff and somehow write articles and somehow do radio shows and somehow make films and somehow pay my bills and somehow see my family and somehow get my floss my teeth.
[01:46:13.147 --> 01:46:14.648]  I have to hurry to floss my teeth.
[01:46:14.648 --> 01:46:15.409]  I work so much.
[01:46:16.589 --> 01:46:20.351]  Well, I don't think you... I think you can stay endorsing him.
[01:46:20.351 --> 01:46:23.453]  I don't think he's up to no good or something.
[01:46:23.453 --> 01:46:25.794]  Well, we allow the advertising.
[01:46:25.794 --> 01:46:26.055]  Okay.
[01:46:26.055 --> 01:46:27.996]  It's a paltry sum.
[01:46:27.996 --> 01:46:30.837]  I'll tell you, our advertising is the best deal out there.
[01:46:30.837 --> 01:46:32.278]  Yeah.
[01:46:32.278 --> 01:46:35.440]  Then there's a question about the shipping costs.
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:41.944]  I know you don't like to talk about the technical stuff about shipping and stuff, but I...
[01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:57.828]  I ordered some of your videos and they were, the shipping costs were 60 Euros, 60 dollars, excuse me, 60 dollars and that was more than, that was a lot.
[01:46:57.828 --> 01:47:01.730]  So I think... I'm just curious, how fast did you get it?
[01:47:01.730 --> 01:47:03.871]  Within three, four weeks.
[01:47:03.871 --> 01:47:07.413]  Okay, well let me go back here and explain something.
[01:47:07.413 --> 01:47:09.995]  Since we're going to have this discussion here on air, let's have it.
[01:47:10.934 --> 01:47:11.854]  I'm in hell.
[01:47:11.854 --> 01:47:13.955]  I'm in absolute hell here.
[01:47:13.955 --> 01:47:17.797]  Again, I don't have money to hire the people.
[01:47:17.797 --> 01:47:20.118]  I'm working all the time.
[01:47:20.118 --> 01:47:24.160]  We barely sell enough to operate.
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:26.401]  Let me explain something to you.
[01:47:26.401 --> 01:47:31.163]  Most shipping out of the country now is like a hundred plus dollars.
[01:47:31.163 --> 01:47:34.024]  And so we just put that amount, because that's how much
[01:47:35.572 --> 01:47:39.154]  That's how much it costs to ship one or two videos.
[01:47:39.154 --> 01:47:42.937]  And so I eat the cost of shipping.
[01:47:42.937 --> 01:47:43.737]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:47:43.737 --> 01:47:45.819]  I'm going to answer all this now for you.
[01:47:45.819 --> 01:47:48.140]  Okay?
[01:47:48.140 --> 01:48:02.670]  If we ship USPS, United States Postal Service, out of the country, they rip it open, they steal it, and half the time it doesn't make it there, and we ship it two, three times to get it to you, and they rip it open, they break it, it gets stuck in customs.
[01:48:04.543 --> 01:48:08.424]  So, I go out and I shop DHL, FedEx, UPS.
[01:48:08.424 --> 01:48:11.385]  UPS is the cheapest to Europe.
[01:48:11.385 --> 01:48:12.886]  And that's how much it is now.
[01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:16.507]  Under the new anti-terror laws, it used to be 20-something bucks to ship there.
[01:48:16.507 --> 01:48:17.867]  Now it's 60-something.
[01:48:17.867 --> 01:48:23.129]  We're losing money at 60 bucks to ship to Europe.
[01:48:23.129 --> 01:48:23.409]  Okay?
[01:48:24.156 --> 01:48:35.662]  Now, it's only like 15 or something to Canada, and they still, even with UPS, UPS is, we never say anything like it, they still open them, they tear them up, they send them back, they're a bunch of criminals that run that country up there!
[01:48:35.662 --> 01:48:44.767]  And I have been tempted to cease all international sales, or try to find distributors in each country, and just get one shipment through to them and get it out that way.
[01:48:44.767 --> 01:48:48.069]  But I don't have time to, the people, to manage it, to do it.
[01:48:48.069 --> 01:48:50.971]  I mean, you just, it's just, I literally, folks, I fight as hard as I can.
[01:48:50.971 --> 01:48:52.792]  And, uh,
[01:48:53.726 --> 01:48:57.627]  We've tried to get shipments inside the country to where you get it in six or seven days.
[01:48:57.627 --> 01:48:58.628]  We've gotten better at that.
[01:48:58.628 --> 01:49:01.689]  We still have problems.
[01:49:01.689 --> 01:49:04.670]  And, you know, just see all your purchases as support.
[01:49:04.670 --> 01:49:06.991]  I mean, it all goes to UPS.
[01:49:06.991 --> 01:49:10.512]  If somebody knows a better way, at least with UPS, you get it.
[01:49:10.512 --> 01:49:13.753]  You still get it in three, four weeks outside the country.
[01:49:13.753 --> 01:49:14.813]  Should get there in three days.
[01:49:14.813 --> 01:49:16.474]  It doesn't.
[01:49:16.474 --> 01:49:17.494]  We're in a police state.
[01:49:17.494 --> 01:49:18.315]  Do you understand that?
[01:49:18.315 --> 01:49:20.796]  Do you understand they read the mail, folks?
[01:49:20.796 --> 01:49:21.896]  I mean, this is not a joke.
[01:49:22.631 --> 01:49:25.572]  This is the real deal!
[01:49:25.572 --> 01:49:33.534]  In fact, I never asked for this because I don't want to be associated with the scallywags out there who all they do is beg for money.
[01:49:33.534 --> 01:49:34.854]  They hit up old ladies.
[01:49:34.854 --> 01:49:38.495]  They tell people, you know, give us your inheritance.
[01:49:38.495 --> 01:49:39.255]  I don't do all that.
[01:49:39.255 --> 01:49:40.355]  I don't care about money.
[01:49:40.355 --> 01:49:43.556]  But I think I better start caring about it just so I can pay for this operation.
[01:49:43.556 --> 01:49:46.177]  Hey folks, if you want to make it easy for you, just go ahead and send me a check.
[01:49:46.801 --> 01:49:57.010]  Just go ahead and send me a check and you will be, I guarantee you, 94%, because I've had an accountant look at it, will be spent in this office on fighting the new world order.
[01:49:57.010 --> 01:50:04.316]  I'm going to tell you right now, I take about 6% for myself, so I can live in relative comfort.
[01:50:04.316 --> 01:50:07.678]  As I work 18 hours a day, I'm your slave, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:50:07.678 --> 01:50:09.480]  I am totally committed to this, okay?
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:11.061]  I am pure of heart.
[01:50:11.061 --> 01:50:13.043]  All my problems, I am still a good person.
[01:50:13.698 --> 01:50:16.680]  I try everything I can, I beat my brains out!
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:19.321]  And everybody says, oh, we want to come help you.
[01:50:19.321 --> 01:50:20.502]  It takes time to tell people how to help you.
[01:50:20.502 --> 01:50:21.322]  Then you've got to manage.
[01:50:21.322 --> 01:50:22.223]  Then you've got to watch people.
[01:50:22.223 --> 01:50:23.183]  Then you've got all these problems.
[01:50:23.183 --> 01:50:24.564]  You've got all this stuff going on.
[01:50:24.564 --> 01:50:26.085]  Things you can't even imagine, folks.
[01:50:27.290 --> 01:50:28.091]  So I need your help.
[01:50:28.091 --> 01:50:28.731]  You know what?
[01:50:28.731 --> 01:50:33.996]  I could do better and hire more people and do a better job on the shipping and everything, but I don't sell enough to be able to do that.
[01:50:33.996 --> 01:50:34.556]  So I'll tell you what.
[01:50:34.556 --> 01:50:39.320]  You want to donate to me, folks, you just get out your checkbook and you just write a big, fat check.
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:40.301]  I'm serious!
[01:50:40.301 --> 01:50:41.162]  Okay?
[01:50:41.162 --> 01:50:50.550]  And we will get a bigger office and we'll get more people and I'll even hire somebody just to try to give you phone numbers and people to help you with CPS or... because I'm already doing that!
[01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:51.811]  Hell, I'm already paying for it!
[01:50:52.501 --> 01:50:53.102]  That's the thing!
[01:50:53.102 --> 01:50:55.263]  We're here non-stop trying to help people.
[01:50:55.263 --> 01:51:02.329]  We're here non-stop, 500 phone calls a day, 2,000, 3,000 emails a day, hundreds of faxes, piles of letters, just wallowing in it.
[01:51:02.329 --> 01:51:04.991]  And then I get letters going, you didn't respond to my letter.
[01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:05.932]  I hate you now.
[01:51:05.932 --> 01:51:07.253]  Folks, that's what they say to me.
[01:51:07.253 --> 01:51:10.616]  I can't answer you!
[01:51:10.616 --> 01:51:12.217]  Okay, so send me checks.
[01:51:12.217 --> 01:51:13.418]  Send me money.
[01:51:13.418 --> 01:51:14.079]  I need it.
[01:51:14.079 --> 01:51:15.720]  I'll use it to fight the New World Order.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:17.842]  I'll give you the address when we get back.
[01:51:17.842 --> 01:51:18.102]  Okay?
[01:51:19.574 --> 01:51:22.741]  Better than giving to the scum out there I know are a bunch of trash.
[01:51:22.741 --> 01:51:23.483]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:51:36.784 --> 01:51:42.614]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:51:42.614 --> 01:51:50.247]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:50.942 --> 01:51:58.405]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:58.405 --> 01:52:10.150]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:52:10.150 --> 01:52:14.112]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:52:14.112 --> 01:52:16.373]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:52:16.373 --> 01:52:20.215]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:53:05.841 --> 01:53:09.562]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:53:09.562 --> 01:53:16.924]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[01:54:29.126 --> 01:54:34.449]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:54:34.449 --> 01:54:39.073]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:40.268 --> 01:54:43.809]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:43.809 --> 01:55:05.958]  Alright, if you want to know about the shipping, like postal service to the world would usually cost like twenty-something bucks and then half the time it didn't get there.
[01:55:07.063 --> 01:55:09.864]  And so that's how much UPS costs, okay?
[01:55:09.864 --> 01:55:11.725]  I think it costs a lot more.
[01:55:11.725 --> 01:55:15.146]  I mean, call them up and get international shipping rates.
[01:55:15.146 --> 01:55:18.187]  Because they only do, like, this weird three-day thing, and that's what it costs.
[01:55:18.187 --> 01:55:22.349]  So, you notice, like, you can get some of my DVDs for $5.95 apiece.
[01:55:22.349 --> 01:55:24.430]  You can get, uh, you know, Terror Storm for $9.95.
[01:55:25.993 --> 01:55:32.097]  You know, we try to discount all that, but yeah, the shipping is a complete hassle and a headache out of this country.
[01:55:32.097 --> 01:55:33.958]  And it wasn't like that three, four years ago.
[01:55:33.958 --> 01:55:36.860]  It just gets worse and worse and worse.
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:41.023]  And even with UPS, there's still stuff goes on.
[01:55:42.259 --> 01:55:45.000]  But I hope you will support us, because we want to do more things.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.640]  We want to put up bigger websites.
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:48.381]  We want to reach more people.
[01:55:48.381 --> 01:55:50.081]  We want to get more stories out.
[01:55:50.081 --> 01:55:52.602]  We want to go out and do more reports for you.
[01:55:52.602 --> 01:55:54.082]  But we do need your support.
[01:55:54.082 --> 01:56:05.705]  And so I'm asking you to just go to Infowars.com and order the Everything Special, or order five copies of my films, or order the books and videos that you support other people who make films that we carry in books.
[01:56:05.705 --> 01:56:08.786]  Or if you just want to write us a check, folks, that's fine.
[01:56:08.786 --> 01:56:09.906]  Because I will use it
[01:56:10.623 --> 01:56:23.330]  To do the things we need to do up here, to get better equipment, to give everybody better service, to make better films, to go out and, you know, pay my people to go out and shoot video of other stuff and put it out for free on Google.
[01:56:23.330 --> 01:56:32.436]  You know, all of that, you can simply, you can simply write to me, I'm Alex Jones, at 3001, that's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:56:41.321 --> 01:56:47.485]  That's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:56:47.485 --> 01:56:55.630]  And you can also call, I think you can give a donation by calling, 888-253-3139.
[01:56:55.630 --> 01:57:05.656]  I mean, I'm serious about fighting the New World Order, folks, and I'd like to be able to do all the things I want to do just off video sales.
[01:57:05.656 --> 01:57:09.698]  But frankly, to go to the next level, we need more support.
[01:57:10.692 --> 01:57:13.793]  And, uh, that's what we need to do, and you need to support us.
[01:57:13.793 --> 01:57:15.613]  I'm asking for your support.
[01:57:15.613 --> 01:57:29.856]  So, if you want to donate by writing us a check, or a money order, or by calling that number with your credit card, or by buying a bunch of my videos and books, that's the preferred way for you to do it, and you know you get a material, you know you get something that'll wake people up, I just say buy one copy and make copies.
[01:57:29.856 --> 01:57:30.657]  You know?
[01:57:30.657 --> 01:57:32.577]  I put, I make films, I put them out for free!
[01:57:32.577 --> 01:57:36.558]  I just want to fight the New World Order, I need the tools to do it!
[01:57:38.148 --> 01:57:39.368]  You know, it's like I'm playing football.
[01:57:39.368 --> 01:57:40.729]  I just need the pads, folks.
[01:57:40.729 --> 01:57:42.450]  Just give me the pads and I'll go out there.
[01:57:42.450 --> 01:57:45.431]  Hell, I'm out there right now basically without them.
[01:57:45.431 --> 01:57:53.434]  So, again, write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:57:53.434 --> 01:57:59.977]  Or you can go to InfoWars.com and buy the books and videos and everything off the secure shopping cart.
[01:57:59.977 --> 01:58:03.918]  But, uh, I would ask you to, you know, write to us and get some of the books and videos.
[01:58:03.918 --> 01:58:05.179]  Or give us a donation.
[01:58:05.179 --> 01:58:05.659]  I mean, you know.
[01:58:09.121 --> 01:58:14.128]  I just know there are other people that do it and they don't usually spend the money on the fight and that makes me mad.
[01:58:14.128 --> 01:58:15.470]  I don't want to be associated with that.
[01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:18.915]  At the same time, I know I'm pure of heart on this issue.
[01:58:18.915 --> 01:58:20.297]  I'm pure of heart on some other issues.
[01:58:20.297 --> 01:58:20.897]  I'm not perfect.
[01:58:24.514 --> 01:58:26.174]  You know, I'm a lustful person, things like that.
[01:58:26.174 --> 01:58:28.275]  People tell me, don't be so honest, Alex.
[01:58:28.275 --> 01:58:29.795]  I don't care anymore.
[01:58:29.795 --> 01:58:31.316]  Do you understand that?
[01:58:31.316 --> 01:58:35.176]  I mean, I want everybody to know, too, I'm on the edge of attacking all my enemies.
[01:58:35.176 --> 01:58:37.957]  Not because they've ever hurt me, but because they've hurt this movement.
[01:58:37.957 --> 01:58:39.417]  And they've hurt this country.
[01:58:39.417 --> 01:58:44.098]  See, I've never attacked people who've attacked me, because I don't like to give them attention and give the little weaklings what they want.
[01:58:44.098 --> 01:58:46.519]  What they don't know is that if I attack them, it will destroy them!
[01:58:46.519 --> 01:58:50.160]  Because they're legends in their own little minds!
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:50.880]  And they don't know!
[01:58:53.712 --> 01:58:56.915]  I'm telling the Patriot Movement, the Truth Movement, all of you.
[01:58:56.915 --> 01:59:03.660]  You straighten up right now, or I guarantee you my listeners are going to smash you into the ground.
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:06.622]  This is a war, this is a battle, this isn't a game!
[01:59:06.622 --> 01:59:13.627]  We'll be right back with the third hour!
[01:59:13.627 --> 01:59:18.271]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:59:24.224 --> 01:59:26.185]  Dad, can we stop?
[01:59:26.185 --> 01:59:28.127]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[01:59:28.127 --> 01:59:28.727]  What?
[01:59:28.727 --> 01:59:29.508]  Again?
[01:59:29.508 --> 01:59:31.209]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[01:59:31.209 --> 01:59:35.873]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[01:59:35.873 --> 01:59:37.374]  Why did you do that?
[01:59:37.374 --> 01:59:43.458]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[01:59:43.458 --> 01:59:44.599]  Are we there yet?
[01:59:44.599 --> 01:59:45.920]  for the entire trip.
[01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:48.082]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[01:59:48.582 --> 01:59:49.863]  Great idea!
[01:59:49.863 --> 01:59:52.825]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids!
[01:59:52.825 --> 01:59:54.526]  Bottled water costs around $75.
[01:59:54.526 --> 01:59:57.168]  It costs us less per refill.
[01:59:57.168 --> 01:59:57.488]  Honey!
[01:59:58.314 --> 01:59:59.954]  You're terrific!
[01:59:59.954 --> 02:00:01.555]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[02:00:01.555 --> 02:00:05.236]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[02:00:05.236 --> 02:00:06.516]  Now can we stop?
[02:00:06.516 --> 02:00:07.536]  I need to go, too.

[02:00:41.535 --> 02:00:43.116]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:43.116 --> 02:00:47.279]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:47.279 --> 02:00:51.381]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:08.190 --> 02:01:09.831]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:09.831 --> 02:01:10.471]  Welcome back.
[02:01:10.471 --> 02:01:12.993]  We're now into our number three.
[02:01:14.534 --> 02:01:23.277]  And Aaron Russo is on the line with us from Houston, Texas, and he's going to be talking about American freedom to fascism, April 15th is coming up.
[02:01:23.277 --> 02:01:33.861]  He's also going to be discussing some of the, he went further than he's ever gone in an interview I did with him for video, Saturday in Houston, about what Nick Rockefeller told him and how he tried to recruit him.
[02:01:33.861 --> 02:01:35.182]  And also, out of the gates,
[02:01:36.941 --> 02:01:39.402]  Aaron's going to tell you about how he's doing medically right now.
[02:01:39.402 --> 02:01:42.683]  There's been a lot of questions, a lot of rumors flying around out there.
[02:01:42.683 --> 02:01:44.564]  But first off, Aaron, you were just a great guy.
[02:01:44.564 --> 02:01:51.927]  I felt like I knew you all these years talking to you over the phone, interviewing you, but it was really great meeting you and your wife and your dog, Sockie.
[02:01:51.927 --> 02:01:52.808]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[02:01:52.808 --> 02:01:54.648]  It was a pleasure to see you on Saturday.
[02:01:54.648 --> 02:01:56.629]  I really enjoyed the interview.
[02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:59.110]  It was great you came over to Houston to do it.
[02:01:59.110 --> 02:02:03.472]  And I'm indebted to you, and the whole country's indebted to you for what you're doing.
[02:02:04.119 --> 02:02:07.803]  And it's just a great thing, and I was glad to meet you face-to-face for the first time.
[02:02:07.803 --> 02:02:09.244]  I felt like I've known you for years.
[02:02:09.244 --> 02:02:19.374]  I mean, I've so respected... I mean, I don't mean to, you know, overdo it, but I so respected your work, what you've been doing over all these years, and fighting for the true values of this country and freedom.
[02:02:20.052 --> 02:02:27.561]  And to meet you face to face and to see you really a very kind guy and you have a big heart and you mean well.
[02:02:27.561 --> 02:02:32.287]  It was a terrific interview and I'm glad we met and it was a pleasure to see you.
[02:02:32.287 --> 02:02:32.868]  It really was.
[02:02:37.905 --> 02:02:44.489]  I didn't know you've been fighting cancer for four plus years, and I didn't know that you keep beating it, but then it keeps coming back.
[02:02:44.489 --> 02:02:49.051]  You really have been fighting hard, and you're in Houston right now.
[02:02:49.051 --> 02:02:51.012]  Bring folks up to speed on that.
[02:02:51.012 --> 02:02:51.512]  Oh, sure.
[02:02:51.512 --> 02:03:02.638]  Well, I've been fighting cancer for four years, and what happens is I've had three different surgeries to get rid of tumors, and every time we do it, we think the cancer was gone.
[02:03:03.488 --> 02:03:13.154]  And it would keep coming back, and the tumors were just a symptom of the problem, and the cancer never really left, even though at times I thought it did.
[02:03:13.154 --> 02:03:25.942]  And so, when I came back from Germany, and they removed four tumors from me in Germany, I did a PET scan, and they said I was free of cancer.
[02:03:25.942 --> 02:03:29.044]  But a few months later, I discovered that I was back again.
[02:03:29.716 --> 02:03:36.899]  And so now what I'm doing is we're attacking the source, the root of the cancer, and not just the tumors, not just the symptoms.
[02:03:36.899 --> 02:03:45.683]  And there's a method in dealing with cancer where they actually identify the gene that's causing the cancer.
[02:03:45.683 --> 02:03:51.805]  And if you have a malignant gene that's out of sync with the rest of your body, they can identify it.
[02:03:51.805 --> 02:03:53.926]  And then there's certain medications you can take.
[02:03:54.767 --> 02:04:03.494]  That will starve the cancer cells of blood so the cancer will wither away and die.
[02:04:03.494 --> 02:04:04.935]  And that's what I'm doing now.
[02:04:04.935 --> 02:04:07.777]  And it's really very cutting-edge stuff.
[02:04:07.777 --> 02:04:11.820]  And I'm very, very happy here in Houston doing what I'm doing.
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:14.082]  And I feel great.
[02:04:14.082 --> 02:04:18.225]  I feel very confident that I'm going to beat my cancer.
[02:04:18.225 --> 02:04:19.266]  You know, or the cancer.
[02:04:19.266 --> 02:04:20.687]  I shouldn't call it my cancer.
[02:04:20.687 --> 02:04:21.928]  But that I'm going to beat the cancer.
[02:04:22.572 --> 02:04:28.637]  And that we're going to get rid of this thing and that it'll be fine, be cured once and for all and be over with.
[02:04:28.637 --> 02:04:29.958]  Now, you're a tough guy, Aaron.
[02:04:29.958 --> 02:04:31.038]  I mean, I appreciate you.
[02:04:31.038 --> 02:04:36.262]  Just days, you had another surgery just to, you know, unblock part of your body.
[02:04:36.262 --> 02:04:39.385]  And man, you're tough to still do the interview with me.
[02:04:39.385 --> 02:04:41.867]  I know you were in a lot of pain and I appreciate you doing it.
[02:04:41.867 --> 02:04:46.890]  I mean, I guess one of the tumors now was blocking your bladder and had to go in and put some stents in there.
[02:04:46.890 --> 02:04:48.792]  So you're roughing it, my friend.
[02:04:48.792 --> 02:04:51.113]  Well, what happened was the tumor was
[02:04:52.369 --> 02:04:57.852]  There's a part of your body called the urea, which leads from the kidney into the bladder.
[02:04:57.852 --> 02:05:03.496]  And it's a tube, sort of, that you have to urinate through that goes to the bladder.
[02:05:03.496 --> 02:05:05.897]  The liquid goes to your bladder from the kidney.
[02:05:05.897 --> 02:05:13.502]  And the tumor was blocking it and not letting the water go through.
[02:05:13.502 --> 02:05:17.224]  And so I was swelling up with lots of liquid.
[02:05:17.224 --> 02:05:20.346]  I was, you know, I was getting put on lots of water weight.
[02:05:21.415 --> 02:05:22.676]  Stay there, we've got a break.
[02:05:22.676 --> 02:05:27.899]  Aaron Russo, an amazing individual, the director, the producer of America, Freedom to Fascism.
[02:05:27.899 --> 02:05:33.863]  Stay with us.
[02:05:33.863 --> 02:05:37.365]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:05:37.365 --> 02:05:39.686]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:05:39.686 --> 02:05:47.331]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:48.012 --> 02:05:55.455]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:55.455 --> 02:06:07.199]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:06:07.199 --> 02:06:11.141]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:06:11.141 --> 02:06:13.421]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:13.421 --> 02:06:17.263]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:07:30.159 --> 02:07:34.425]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:07:34.425 --> 02:07:37.989]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:07:37.989 --> 02:07:41.473]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:07:41.713 --> 02:07:44.994]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:07:44.994 --> 02:07:50.497]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[02:07:50.497 --> 02:08:00.261]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:08:00.261 --> 02:08:01.582]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:08:01.582 --> 02:08:07.024]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:08:07.424 --> 02:08:13.588]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems, it'll work on other problems as well.

[02:08:31.886 --> 02:08:38.530]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:38.530 --> 02:08:43.413]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:43.413 --> 02:08:48.577]  You know, I don't want to belabor it all day, but he really is a guy with a lot of moral and physical strength.
[02:08:48.577 --> 02:08:58.423]  Aaron Russo, an amazing individual, Hollywood producer, championship arm wrestler, clothing designer, Bette Midler's manager, made movies with Eddie Murphy.
[02:08:59.415 --> 02:09:02.199]  But his really big accomplishments have been fighting the New World Order.
[02:09:02.199 --> 02:09:06.244]  His TV show, Mad as Hell, founding the Constitution Party, which he founded.
[02:09:06.244 --> 02:09:14.935]  He also got the Libertarian nomination, briefly, and then it got taken away by some people combining their votes together.
[02:09:14.935 --> 02:09:16.737]  So, I mean, he's an incredible fighter.
[02:09:18.068 --> 02:09:21.772]  And he for four years has been fighting cancer.
[02:09:21.772 --> 02:09:22.973]  Thought he'd beat it in Germany.
[02:09:22.973 --> 02:09:29.940]  While he was trying to finish American Freedom to Fascism, he came back, discovered he had cancer, metastasized again.
[02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:33.463]  He's been down in Houston, had surgery on his
[02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:35.070]  I think so.
[02:09:54.018 --> 02:09:57.259]  Well, I'm working with Dr. Stan Brzezinski at the Brzezinski Clinic here in Houston.
[02:10:20.522 --> 02:10:23.344]  And he's a very, very cutting-edge guy.
[02:10:23.344 --> 02:10:32.611]  He's been fighting the FDA for years, and now he's doing clinical trials, and he's working with the Cleveland Clinic.
[02:10:32.611 --> 02:10:46.401]  And what he's doing, as I tried to get into before, is defining ways to stop cancer by identifying certain genes, and then denying blood to the cancer cells, so those cancers will starve and go away.
[02:10:46.401 --> 02:10:49.643]  And it's very, very cutting-edge stuff, and I love this man.
[02:10:50.279 --> 02:11:17.203]  He's a brilliant, brilliant doctor and I'm in the best hands possible and I'm very confident that we're going to win and that I'm going to move on and make more movies or run for office or do the things that I want to do to stop what's going on in this country and to defeat this New World Order and the North American Union because we must defeat it and we have no choice and I'm prepared to do whatever necessary
[02:11:17.645 --> 02:11:27.390]  To do that, and that's why I made America Freedom to Fascism, and that's why I made the original thing Mad As Hell many years ago, which got me started in a way.
[02:11:27.390 --> 02:11:40.656]  And I just feel very strongly that we're in such a state of decline and that people have to get motivated, they have to join together, we have to stop being separate entities and letting everybody's egos get in their way.
[02:11:41.221 --> 02:11:54.760]  And we have to join together all the people who believe in freedom and believe in the Founding Fathers and our Constitution and want individual liberty and not a country run by institutions, for the institutions and by the institutions.
[02:11:55.407 --> 02:12:05.590]  But a country run for the people, by the people, and the people, you know, the citizens who want to do that have to join together and not be in separate groups.
[02:12:05.590 --> 02:12:12.092]  You know, I want to talk about April 15th coming up and what's happening to Wesley Snipes, who you know personally, and who's seen America freedom to fascism.
[02:12:12.792 --> 02:12:13.373]  I think so.
[02:12:32.333 --> 02:12:34.274]  And select clips will be in the film.
[02:12:34.274 --> 02:12:38.837]  I want you to walk through, because I asked you, you know, your life, what woke you up?
[02:12:38.837 --> 02:12:45.761]  And you told some stories I didn't know about, about corrupt police in Chicago, things you witnessed, you know, things that helped you grow up.
[02:12:45.761 --> 02:12:56.066]  I mean, I had similar things happen to me that I saw growing up that let me not be as naive as some of the general public, and then how you lived in Tahiti, and you know, and you came back, and just your life.
[02:12:56.066 --> 02:12:58.868]  Then let's get into April 15th coming up, and then into Nick Rockefeller.
[02:12:59.861 --> 02:13:03.923]  Okay, so you want me to discuss about what happened in Chicago when I was living in Chicago?
[02:13:03.923 --> 02:13:07.004]  Well, I mean, how you grew up, who you were, because that's important.
[02:13:07.004 --> 02:13:07.804]  What makes a leader?
[02:13:07.804 --> 02:13:08.644]  What makes a patriot?
[02:13:08.644 --> 02:13:09.785]  You know, your process.
[02:13:09.785 --> 02:13:12.286]  I want folks to know who Aaron Russo is.
[02:13:12.286 --> 02:13:12.926]  I see.
[02:13:12.926 --> 02:13:19.608]  Well, you know, I'm a guy, I'm a Jewish guy, and I came out, I lived in New York in the late 60s.
[02:13:22.610 --> 02:13:29.892]  There was that whole rock and roll era going on of the hippies and the big Chicago convention where Mayor Daley was in 1968.
[02:13:29.892 --> 02:13:33.974]  And it just so happens I opened a nightclub in Chicago in 1968.
[02:13:33.974 --> 02:13:36.494]  I was a 24 year old kid.
[02:13:36.494 --> 02:13:39.555]  And I opened my first nightclub and it was a big club.
[02:13:39.555 --> 02:13:42.816]  And we had lots of music acts in there.
[02:13:42.816 --> 02:13:47.338]  And at the time we were attracting all the hippies who were coming to the club.
[02:13:47.338 --> 02:13:50.659]  And also that was the year of the Democratic Convention in Chicago.
[02:13:51.346 --> 02:14:04.090]  And so a lot of hippies would come to Chicago to protest the convention, and my club became like a meeting place for a lot of the people who were very politically active.
[02:14:04.090 --> 02:14:07.651]  And we were having a concert there one evening.
[02:14:07.651 --> 02:14:09.271]  The club held like 5,000 people.
[02:14:09.271 --> 02:14:11.192]  It was a big nightclub.
[02:14:11.192 --> 02:14:14.433]  And it held 5,000 people, and I was looking out my office window
[02:14:15.973 --> 02:14:24.478]  Because we have this really lovely concert in there, and I was looking out my office window, and I saw all these police paddy wagons pulling up in front of my nightclub.
[02:14:24.478 --> 02:14:25.738]  And I had no idea why.
[02:14:25.738 --> 02:14:30.721]  And there were like 15 or 20 paddy wagons pulling up with their blue lights flashing.
[02:14:30.721 --> 02:14:33.222]  And I said, oh my God, we're being raided.
[02:14:33.222 --> 02:14:42.707]  And I ran down to the stage, and I got on the stage, and I took the microphone from the band that was playing, and I said, listen, we're being raided by the police.
[02:14:43.494 --> 02:14:48.679]  Uh, everybody sit down on the floor, pull out your whatever identification you have, and cooperate with the police.
[02:14:48.679 --> 02:14:56.085]  As I said that, uh, a cop threw me off the stage into the arms of some other cops, and they dragged me out of the club.
[02:14:56.085 --> 02:15:04.712]  Uh, and as they were dragging me out, I saw the fighter bomber was there, and they were dumping garbage cans all over the floor.
[02:15:04.712 --> 02:15:05.793]  You know, littering the floor.
[02:15:05.793 --> 02:15:07.194]  I thought that was really odd.
[02:15:07.194 --> 02:15:08.435]  I didn't understand what was going on.
[02:15:09.384 --> 02:15:11.426]  And they threw me into the paddy wagon.
[02:15:11.426 --> 02:15:19.571]  As I got into the paddy wagon, one of the policemen grabbed me from the back of my testicles and just squeezed as I got into the paddy wagon.
[02:15:19.571 --> 02:15:22.233]  And it really was very, very painful.
[02:15:22.233 --> 02:15:32.480]  And the person that came in next, as he was entering the paddy wagon without resistance, they just banged him in the head with a billy club and split his skull.
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:34.441]  And he did nothing wrong.
[02:15:34.441 --> 02:15:35.982]  And I started seeing all this stuff.
[02:15:35.982 --> 02:15:37.203]  I couldn't believe what was happening.
[02:15:37.203 --> 02:15:38.304]  I thought I was in a dream world.
[02:15:39.265 --> 02:16:00.332]  And, um, uh, they booked us, they took us to the thing, finally we were let out, and, uh, what happened was, a few days later, I made the headlines in the newspapers, electric theaters short-circuited, and my picture was on the front page, and a few days later, uh, a couple of, uh, officers, policemen came to see me.
[02:16:00.332 --> 02:16:02.052]  One was a captain, one was a sergeant.
[02:16:02.052 --> 02:16:05.033]  I still remember their names, even though I won't put it on the air now.
[02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:10.602]  And, uh, they came to see me and they said, Mr. Russo, we're sorry if you got hurt the other night.
[02:16:10.602 --> 02:16:11.782]  We didn't realize that was you.
[02:16:11.782 --> 02:16:17.464]  You're so young, you know, but, um, you know, we, we control the city.
[02:16:17.464 --> 02:16:27.108]  And, uh, if you want to stay in business, you know, uh, we'll let you stay in business, but there's a certain plan you have to, we have certain plans you have to go by.
[02:16:27.108 --> 02:16:31.489]  We have the A plan, the B plan, the C plan, and the super deluxe plan.
[02:16:31.489 --> 02:16:33.910]  And the super deluxe plan will cost you this much money a month.
[02:16:35.093 --> 02:16:37.095]  And you give us that much money a month.
[02:16:37.095 --> 02:16:39.497]  I think it was $2,000 a month.
[02:16:39.497 --> 02:16:42.359]  And whenever we're going to raise you, we'll let you know.
[02:16:42.359 --> 02:16:44.521]  We won't cause any real problems here.
[02:16:44.521 --> 02:16:46.322]  We'll work with you, you know.
[02:16:46.322 --> 02:16:49.025]  We'll just do things for parents' sake.
[02:16:49.025 --> 02:16:50.726]  And I went along with that.
[02:16:50.726 --> 02:16:51.627]  And I paid them off.
[02:16:51.627 --> 02:16:52.868]  And I gave them $2,000 a month.
[02:16:52.868 --> 02:16:55.350]  They would come every month and collect the money.
[02:16:55.350 --> 02:16:57.191]  And they told me the money was going to Mayor Daley.
[02:16:57.191 --> 02:16:58.312]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[02:16:58.312 --> 02:17:00.454]  I never saw it go to him.
[02:17:00.454 --> 02:17:03.056]  But I used to pay them off.
[02:17:03.056 --> 02:17:03.897]  And that was my first...
[02:17:05.466 --> 02:17:08.435]  Running with police and the police state.
[02:17:09.005 --> 02:17:10.546]  And I thought it was just Chicago.
[02:17:10.546 --> 02:17:16.849]  Well, see, when I grew up in Rockwell, everybody knew the sheriff dealt all the drugs, and any other dealer that tried to cut in on his op got arrested.
[02:17:16.849 --> 02:17:20.532]  Then later, higher-level drug dealers, FBI, came and busted him.
[02:17:20.532 --> 02:17:21.832]  And that's just how life is.
[02:17:21.832 --> 02:17:23.573]  You got the naive idiots driving around.
[02:17:23.573 --> 02:17:26.735]  They have no idea what's all... And, of course, you thought it was just Chicago.
[02:17:26.735 --> 02:17:28.576]  You told me you learned it was the rest of the nation.
[02:17:28.576 --> 02:17:31.758]  Now, you forgot to tell the part about why they were dumping the trash cans out.
[02:17:31.758 --> 02:17:32.678]  Oh, yes.
[02:17:32.678 --> 02:17:33.519]  This is great.
[02:17:33.519 --> 02:17:34.419]  This is great.
[02:17:34.419 --> 02:17:37.061]  So, the next day in the newspaper,
[02:17:37.968 --> 02:17:55.253]  Uh, the cover story that they gave, uh, for the raid was that the fire department came to inspect the nightclub and the nightclub was full of litter and the fire department, uh, the fire department officials who found all this litter in the nightclub were attacked by the hippies.
[02:17:55.253 --> 02:17:59.234]  So they had to call the police to come and protect them.
[02:17:59.234 --> 02:18:02.195]  That was the story that was in the newspaper the next day.
[02:18:02.816 --> 02:18:03.756]  Total fraud.
[02:18:03.756 --> 02:18:04.896]  Total fake.
[02:18:04.896 --> 02:18:06.397]  You know, just total nonsense.
[02:18:06.397 --> 02:18:07.497]  Totally staged.
[02:18:07.497 --> 02:18:08.217]  Totally staged.
[02:18:08.217 --> 02:18:09.137]  Yeah, totally false.
[02:18:09.137 --> 02:18:11.337]  I mean, there wasn't one bit of truth to it.
[02:18:11.337 --> 02:18:12.098]  You know?
[02:18:12.098 --> 02:18:15.258]  And I tell you, it was so clear, I saw him dumping the litter on purpose.
[02:18:15.258 --> 02:18:17.899]  He saw him dumping the litter, and I went, what are they doing that for?
[02:18:17.899 --> 02:18:18.819]  What was that about?
[02:18:18.819 --> 02:18:31.061]  Then you learned, then you learned later, I'm already doing this video interview folks, that's why I'm finishing the sentences for him, but recapping, then you learned that with the retroactive tax law of 89, happened to my dad too,
[02:18:31.881 --> 02:18:38.464]  They just come and say, you owe money now for all your old taxes, we're taxing you for a couple years back.
[02:18:38.464 --> 02:18:47.407]  Yeah, well what happened was, I was a pretty big silver trader, and I took all the legal tax deductions I was entitled to take.
[02:18:47.407 --> 02:18:51.689]  And this was about 85 or 86, 87, I don't remember the exact year.
[02:18:51.689 --> 02:19:01.213]  And what happened was that the, in 89 I believe it was, they passed a law outlawing those deductions.
[02:19:02.182 --> 02:19:02.962]  You're right.
[02:19:02.962 --> 02:19:06.284]  But not only did they do that, they made it retroactive.
[02:19:06.284 --> 02:19:09.566]  So it was legal before, they said it was not legal anymore.
[02:19:09.566 --> 02:19:11.307]  Not only in the present, but in the past.
[02:19:11.307 --> 02:19:14.169]  And they charged penalty and interest on something that was legal.
[02:19:14.169 --> 02:19:14.409]  Right.
[02:19:14.409 --> 02:19:16.370]  And they charged penalties and interest.
[02:19:16.370 --> 02:19:18.151]  And I said, that can't be possible.
[02:19:18.151 --> 02:19:21.493]  They can't go do something retroactive, make a law retroactive.
[02:19:21.493 --> 02:19:22.354]  That's not possible.
[02:19:22.354 --> 02:19:24.095]  Everybody thought the same way I did.
[02:19:24.095 --> 02:19:27.637]  So there was a big class action lawsuit to stop it.
[02:19:27.637 --> 02:19:29.058]  But the court gave that they could do it.
[02:19:29.895 --> 02:19:32.177]  And that's really when I got fed up with everything.
[02:19:32.177 --> 02:19:41.424]  I said, if they're going to do that, if they're going to make laws retroactive, and then charge you penalties and interest and make you pay, then I'm living in a very sick country.
[02:19:41.424 --> 02:19:49.831]  I'm living in a country where there's no justice, there's no law, and that was really my beginning of my understanding about how evil things were here.
[02:19:49.831 --> 02:19:53.093]  How disgusting that they've become in this country.
[02:19:53.093 --> 02:19:58.918]  How corrupt and ugly and a lack of integrity and honor that our government has.
[02:19:59.531 --> 02:20:01.692]  And that we're just dupes for the government.
[02:20:01.692 --> 02:20:03.833]  And that was the beginning of my knowledge.
[02:20:03.833 --> 02:20:04.554]  Absolutely.
[02:20:04.554 --> 02:20:05.834]  Aaron, amazing.
[02:20:05.834 --> 02:20:09.476]  There's a lot more to the story, but let's get into America, Freedom from Fascism.
[02:20:09.476 --> 02:20:10.737]  April's coming up.
[02:20:10.737 --> 02:20:14.959]  We need a national mobilization to get your film out to at least 10 people.
[02:20:14.959 --> 02:20:18.180]  Every one of you out there, by April 15th, it's easy.
[02:20:18.180 --> 02:20:25.904]  I want you to sit down with 10 people or 10 separate groups, 10 separate showings in your neighborhood.
[02:20:25.904 --> 02:20:27.385]  We'll be right back with Aaron Russo.
[02:20:30.965 --> 02:20:31.885]  Terrorism!
[02:20:31.885 --> 02:20:32.726]  Terrorism!
[02:20:32.726 --> 02:20:39.049]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:20:39.049 --> 02:20:40.890]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:20:40.890 --> 02:20:43.751]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:20:43.751 --> 02:20:58.358]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:20:58.358 --> 02:20:58.858]  government.
[02:20:58.858 --> 02:21:00.659]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:21:01.039 --> 02:21:07.081]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:21:07.081 --> 02:21:11.823]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[02:21:33.784 --> 02:21:39.766]  Did you know that the United Nations has always chosen socialist one-worlders for its leadership?
[02:21:39.766 --> 02:21:45.868]  Did you know that the United Nations seeks power to control the environment, population, children, and the whole world?
[02:21:46.588 --> 02:21:50.031]  They want to dissolve our Constitution and Bill of Rights.

[02:22:29.838 --> 02:22:34.901]  Ted Anderson for Midas January 10, 2007 Gold 609.70 Ounce gold coin 630.05 317.58 for half 158.79 for quarter ounce coins at 630.05 317.58 158.79 1971
[02:22:45.168 --> 02:22:46.689]  Nissan closes the gold window.
[02:22:46.689 --> 02:22:48.370]  Fiat currency, 1920s.
[02:22:48.370 --> 02:22:52.532]  The German mark explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[02:22:52.532 --> 02:22:54.833]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[02:22:54.833 --> 02:22:58.414]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[02:22:58.414 --> 02:23:01.936]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[02:23:01.936 --> 02:23:05.158]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[02:23:05.158 --> 02:23:10.540]  2006, the last superpower of the USA's mighty dollar loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[02:23:10.540 --> 02:23:11.981]  Could government let this happen?
[02:23:11.981 --> 02:23:13.962]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[02:23:14.242 --> 02:23:21.432]  Midas has Nick Bereshoff's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[02:23:21.432 --> 02:23:23.235]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.

[02:23:24.577 --> 02:23:24.757]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:32.119 --> 02:23:36.484]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:23:36.484 --> 02:23:38.506]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:23:38.506 --> 02:23:45.093]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:23:45.093 --> 02:23:51.460]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:23:51.460 --> 02:23:53.302]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:23:53.562 --> 02:23:53.922]  I think so.
[02:24:16.056 --> 02:24:17.238]  Eliminate the cause!

[02:24:20.502 --> 02:24:20.562]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:24:33.326 --> 02:24:37.528]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[02:24:37.528 --> 02:24:42.389]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[02:24:42.389 --> 02:24:45.951]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[02:24:45.951 --> 02:24:56.014]  And when you're out there, without care, yeah I was out of touch.
[02:24:56.014 --> 02:24:58.635]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[02:25:02.159 --> 02:25:05.780]  To learn that everything you've been taught about your country is a lie.
[02:25:05.780 --> 02:25:10.442]  To learn that the whole financial system is a fraud.
[02:25:10.442 --> 02:25:16.565]  To learn that they're not true, they're taking everything over.
[02:25:30.916 --> 02:25:32.360]  What would you do if you learned the truth?
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:34.084]  Would you stand tall?
[02:25:34.084 --> 02:25:35.427]  Or would you turn and walk away?
[02:25:35.427 --> 02:25:36.750]  As Paris says...
[02:25:37.569 --> 02:25:40.670]  Aaron Russo, America Freedom to Fascism director.
[02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:43.190]  We have links to his website up on InfoWars.com.
[02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:46.251]  We carry the amazing DVD.
[02:25:46.251 --> 02:25:46.311]  $19.95.
[02:25:46.311 --> 02:25:50.052]  When you get it for $19.95, you can get my new film Terror Storm for $9.95.
[02:25:50.052 --> 02:25:54.753]  I'm discounting my film to encourage you to get America Freedom to Fascism.
[02:25:54.753 --> 02:26:02.014]  Even if you already have America Freedom to Fascism, you need to support filmmakers like Aaron Russo so he can make more in the future.
[02:26:02.014 --> 02:26:03.534]  Very expensive film to make.
[02:26:03.534 --> 02:26:05.995]  Well over a million dollars just in promotion for it.
[02:26:07.464 --> 02:26:09.425]  You need to support films like Terror Storm.
[02:26:09.425 --> 02:26:11.126]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[02:26:11.126 --> 02:26:13.567]  Aggressively buy a bunch of copies of it.
[02:26:13.567 --> 02:26:15.287]  Or go to Aaron's website and get some.
[02:26:15.287 --> 02:26:16.508]  And get them out to people.
[02:26:16.508 --> 02:26:17.168]  Now listen.
[02:26:17.168 --> 02:26:18.109]  This is a call to action.
[02:26:18.109 --> 02:26:20.950]  I just thought of this going into the last break.
[02:26:20.950 --> 02:26:29.213]  Instead of showing it to ten people, use as much energy and say by April you're going to have four parties.
[02:26:29.213 --> 02:26:30.654]  Four parties, that's easy.
[02:26:30.654 --> 02:26:31.514]  That's every two weeks.
[02:26:32.646 --> 02:26:48.536]  At your house, and you're going to invite the block over, then the next invite folks from work, the next, you know, maybe show it at Sunday school, and sit down, get a pizza, make some spaghetti, whatever, and you know, sit around, and then watch the film, and then talk about it.
[02:26:48.536 --> 02:26:49.317]  You'll have a good time!
[02:26:49.961 --> 02:26:52.022]  And that's how you're going to wake people up and create buzz.
[02:26:52.022 --> 02:26:58.385]  I want parties with America Freedom and Fascism, and then, you know, after April you can do it with Terrorist Storm or whatever.
[02:26:58.385 --> 02:27:02.526]  Or if you want to be more aggressive, have a party every week, or a meeting every week.
[02:27:02.526 --> 02:27:04.607]  Invite, I don't care which two people, but come over, or 15.
[02:27:04.607 --> 02:27:06.908]  I mean, this is how we're going to win the war.
[02:27:06.908 --> 02:27:08.829]  Aaron Russo?
[02:27:08.829 --> 02:27:12.310]  I agree with you, and I think April 15th is coming.
[02:27:12.310 --> 02:27:15.772]  The movie describes what taxes are really about, what the truth is.
[02:27:16.699 --> 02:27:30.116]  And although I never recommend people not to pay their income tax, because as I tell people who always ask me, I say, listen, if the mafia came to you and wanted the maximum amount of money every month from you, I could not advise you not to pay it because you'd get hurt.
[02:27:30.982 --> 02:27:31.322]  Right?
[02:27:31.322 --> 02:27:32.642]  And the same thing with the IRS.
[02:27:32.642 --> 02:27:37.884]  I never advise people not to pay the IRS, because you can get hurt, and if you're in jail, you can't fight.
[02:27:37.884 --> 02:27:38.384]  You know?
[02:27:38.384 --> 02:27:40.464]  But the truth is, there is no law.
[02:27:40.464 --> 02:27:43.565]  And what we have to do is wake people up to the truth.
[02:27:43.565 --> 02:27:45.265]  April 15th is coming.
[02:27:45.265 --> 02:27:46.506]  Invite people over.
[02:27:46.506 --> 02:27:56.508]  If you get the movie on public access stations across the country, which we're doing now, and we played it on one the other day in Maine, and there's so many requests to see it again, they're replaying it again.
[02:27:56.508 --> 02:27:57.608]  Get them on public access.
[02:27:57.608 --> 02:27:59.729]  We can... We played it here in Austin, yeah.
[02:28:00.447 --> 02:28:02.868]  You know, but I'm saying, on public access?
[02:28:02.868 --> 02:28:03.628]  Yes, we did.
[02:28:03.628 --> 02:28:04.109]  In Austin.
[02:28:04.109 --> 02:28:05.549]  A couple weeks ago.
[02:28:05.549 --> 02:28:05.889]  Right.
[02:28:05.889 --> 02:28:06.910]  Keep doing that.
[02:28:06.910 --> 02:28:09.851]  You know, of course... I kind of snuck and did it.
[02:28:09.851 --> 02:28:12.812]  And now I'm glad... I'm glad.
[02:28:12.812 --> 02:28:14.433]  I mean, I give my permission to play that game.
[02:28:14.433 --> 02:28:14.833]  No, I know.
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:21.602]  You know, get it on public access, have parties, have people see it, get people to talk about it.
[02:28:21.602 --> 02:28:23.203]  You know, whatever it takes.
[02:28:23.203 --> 02:28:25.664]  We have to wake people up, we have to save this country.
[02:28:25.664 --> 02:28:27.204]  We've got to stop having a loser out of it.
[02:28:27.204 --> 02:28:28.985]  You know what I like about you, Aaron?
[02:28:28.985 --> 02:28:30.186]  Very few people I've met are like this.
[02:28:30.186 --> 02:28:35.208]  You are a go-getter, you've got a strong spirit, and you're a winner, and you're not playing games.
[02:28:35.208 --> 02:28:37.769]  I mean, you're not doing this to lose, are you?
[02:28:37.769 --> 02:28:38.689]  No, there's no way.
[02:28:38.689 --> 02:28:39.769]  What's the point?
[02:28:39.769 --> 02:28:41.490]  I mean, you know, we have our life.
[02:28:42.211 --> 02:28:45.173]  And if we're not free people, what do we have?
[02:28:45.173 --> 02:28:50.456]  I refuse to allow this banking elite, which runs our country, to control my life.
[02:28:50.456 --> 02:28:52.037]  I refuse to let that happen.
[02:28:52.037 --> 02:28:58.141]  And I want to stand up for America and the people of America and let's all stand together and take our country back.
[02:28:58.141 --> 02:28:59.943]  We cannot allow this to happen.
[02:28:59.943 --> 02:29:09.849]  I mean, I was just reading, I just read a story yesterday about Iraq, where what happened now is the public government in Iraq
[02:29:10.293 --> 02:29:17.496]  Just gave the American oil, or the oil companies, they just passed a law that the oil companies cannot control the oil in Iraq.
[02:29:17.496 --> 02:29:18.697]  That's what it was about.
[02:29:18.697 --> 02:29:19.497]  That's why we went there.
[02:29:19.497 --> 02:29:20.598]  That's what this whole thing is about.
[02:29:20.598 --> 02:29:22.058]  I mean, that's huge.
[02:29:22.058 --> 02:29:24.179]  Why is the Iraq government giving it to the oil companies?
[02:29:24.179 --> 02:29:25.580]  Hey, I'll take you one better.
[02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:27.841]  Two days ago, you know, they attacked Somalia.
[02:29:27.841 --> 02:29:36.985]  It's now admitted in the back of the paper that our government's backing the warlords that killed our troops under Clinton, and is overthrowing a legitimate government that's brought stability.
[02:29:37.734 --> 02:29:41.557]  But then the idiots are on talk radio going, we just got them Somalis back!
[02:29:41.557 --> 02:29:42.077]  No!
[02:29:42.077 --> 02:29:45.080]  Can you believe it?
[02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:47.582]  It's also stupid, it's also fake.
[02:29:47.582 --> 02:29:59.231]  And so what has to happen, the people of goodwill, the people who want to be free, the people who don't want the North American Union, you know, the people who don't want world government, the people who want to live in a free country,
[02:29:59.767 --> 02:30:05.412]  Where you have your individual freedoms and individual rights not be run by institutions, have to join together.
[02:30:05.412 --> 02:30:06.573]  We gotta get aggressive!
[02:30:06.573 --> 02:30:08.554]  Aaron Russo, stay there a long time, we're coming up.
[02:30:08.554 --> 02:30:12.398]  We gotta get aggressive, we gotta get angry, we gotta get in their face.
[02:30:12.398 --> 02:30:21.145]  We'll tell you more about American freedom from fascism, tell the Nick Rockefeller story, and take a few calls on the other side with Aaron Russo.
[02:30:21.145 --> 02:30:25.068]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:25.068 --> 02:30:27.751]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:32.188 --> 02:30:34.930]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:30:34.930 --> 02:30:37.371]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:30:37.371 --> 02:30:47.776]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:30:47.776 --> 02:30:50.298]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[02:31:23.883 --> 02:31:33.372]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at www.CalvinPureSoap.com Attention, attention everyone!
[02:31:33.372 --> 02:31:35.994]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:31:35.994 --> 02:31:40.699]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[02:31:41.380 --> 02:31:48.722]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse, or adding machine.
[02:31:48.722 --> 02:32:02.047]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[02:32:02.047 --> 02:32:02.927]  Wristease is perfect
[02:32:02.967 --> 02:32:03.267]  I think so.
[02:32:30.732 --> 02:32:32.572]  What is the secret of the sea?
[02:32:32.572 --> 02:32:38.414]  It's the exciting food from the sea and it can be yours with nature's original superfood from Wachter's.
[02:32:38.414 --> 02:32:45.276]  This excellent exclusive blend of Wachter's sea vegetation is bursting with over 65 trace minerals and vitamins.
[02:32:45.276 --> 02:32:50.497]  Our sea vegetation contains 40 times more nutrients than any land grown vegetation.
[02:32:50.677 --> 02:33:02.352]  You would need almost 20 pounds of alfalfa, 10 pounds of spirulina and 40 pounds of wheat to get the same nutritional value found in only one pound of Wachter's exclusive blend of sea plants.
[02:33:02.352 --> 02:33:07.439]  Over 75 years of experience has made Wachter's the leader in sea vegetation nutrition.
[02:33:07.739 --> 02:33:08.400]  I think so.
[02:33:54.595 --> 02:33:58.417]  I want my great-great-great-grandchildren to know my name.
[02:33:58.417 --> 02:34:01.219]  And it's not something vain.
[02:34:01.219 --> 02:34:04.581]  I want them to use me as an example.
[02:34:04.581 --> 02:34:07.382]  Not that I'm some really special or good person.
[02:34:07.382 --> 02:34:10.844]  But you don't remember the great-great-great-great-grandpa that was some corrupt judge.
[02:34:10.844 --> 02:34:12.465]  You don't remember the great-great-great-great-grandpa
[02:34:13.129 --> 02:34:14.510]  Who was, you know, even a rich guy.
[02:34:14.510 --> 02:34:23.314]  You remember the great-great-great-grandpa who fought against slavery, or the great-grandpa who beat the Redcoats, or the great-great-grandpa, you know, the great-grandmother who did?
[02:34:23.314 --> 02:34:25.576]  I mean, I want to stand up against corruption.
[02:34:25.576 --> 02:34:27.316]  I want to make it better for people.
[02:34:27.316 --> 02:34:29.197]  I mean, you know, they call that naive and stupid.
[02:34:29.197 --> 02:34:29.658]  No!
[02:34:29.658 --> 02:34:30.858]  That's what life is all about.
[02:34:30.858 --> 02:34:32.739]  And Aaron Russo has that same spirit.
[02:34:32.739 --> 02:34:36.341]  I know we got a lot of phone calls for him, but I want to tell this Nick Rockefeller story.
[02:34:36.341 --> 02:34:39.923]  But I'm encouraging all of you not to wait, not to procrastinate,
[02:34:41.095 --> 02:34:51.757]  But to go immediately to Infowars.com and order America Freedom to Fascism, go to PrisonPlanet.com, order America Freedom to Fascism on DVD, is so powerful.
[02:34:51.757 --> 02:34:54.958]  It's an even different cut than what you saw in theaters, even better.
[02:34:54.958 --> 02:35:05.400]  So important and it's very effective because it covers the banking system, the IRS, the North American Union, the whole global system, microchipping, such a powerful film.
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:06.680]  I mean, that has so many people.
[02:35:07.758 --> 02:35:13.259]  You know, doctors and lawyers and people I know who are like, yeah, I believed you before, but this film really brought it home.
[02:35:13.259 --> 02:35:14.700]  It is so effective.
[02:35:14.700 --> 02:35:15.700]  Or call toll free to get it.
[02:35:15.700 --> 02:35:15.980]  888-253-3139.
[02:35:15.980 --> 02:35:16.100]  888-253-3139.
[02:35:16.100 --> 02:35:18.801]  And folks, buy a bunch of copies of it.
[02:35:18.801 --> 02:35:20.881]  Get it out to people for April 15th.
[02:35:20.881 --> 02:35:21.841]  Have those events.
[02:35:21.841 --> 02:35:23.142]  All of you do it.
[02:35:23.142 --> 02:35:23.442]  Set it up.
[02:35:23.442 --> 02:35:24.422]  Do it in your area.
[02:35:34.634 --> 02:35:44.680]  I mean, I've even thought about the film so important, getting the Alamo Draft House here in Austin, and maybe showing it for three or four nights in a row again, because people, it was sold out when it left the theaters after a week.
[02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:54.686]  Aaron Russo, a few more comments on America, Freedom to Fascism, then I want to get into the story, because you haven't on air ever told the whole story of Nick Rockefeller.
[02:35:54.686 --> 02:35:56.367]  This is so chilling.
[02:35:56.367 --> 02:35:59.989]  But first off, any other key comments about America, Freedom to Fascism?
[02:35:59.989 --> 02:36:02.651]  Well, I just want to say, the film has been very, very effective in
[02:36:03.476 --> 02:36:04.117]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:36:14.540 --> 02:36:18.641]  People always say to me they've heard these things, but they never saw the whole picture before.
[02:36:18.641 --> 02:36:24.022]  And what the film does, it allows people to see the whole picture, the corruption, where we've been and where we're going.
[02:36:24.022 --> 02:36:29.204]  And it's a hundred minutes long, which is long, and I'm not knocking other films.
[02:36:29.204 --> 02:36:32.304]  There are great other films, but they're three, four, five hours long.
[02:36:32.304 --> 02:36:34.825]  Folks, that isn't going to work with the general public.
[02:36:34.825 --> 02:36:38.206]  No, but the thing is that this picture really does work.
[02:36:38.206 --> 02:36:42.107]  You know, I've made big movies like Trading Places with Eddie Murphy and The Rose with Bette Midler.
[02:36:42.540 --> 02:36:56.952]  You know, but this movie, to me, is the most important movie I've ever made, and it's the one I'm most proud of in my life, and it's the one that I think can help turn this country around and wake people up.
[02:36:56.952 --> 02:37:08.162]  We've had almost about a million views on Google in two months or two and a half months, you know, and the picture's really spreading, you know, around the country, and it's making a difference.
[02:37:08.162 --> 02:37:10.184]  And I was thinking, Alex, you know what we should do?
[02:37:10.839 --> 02:37:23.309]  You and I should do a tour of the country and go into different halls and stadiums in each big city in the country and put on big events and talk to the people and stage like a concert, almost like a music act.
[02:37:23.309 --> 02:37:24.550]  There's a concert.
[02:37:24.550 --> 02:37:29.234]  You and I should go around the country and do a freedom exhibit.
[02:37:29.234 --> 02:37:30.255]  Restore the Republic.
[02:37:30.925 --> 02:37:31.385]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:37:50.254 --> 02:38:11.005]  This Nick Rockefeller story, you've told a piece on my show before, you did it here first, and a few other places you've told a piece of it, but in the interview we did this last Saturday in Houston, while you were getting cancer treatment, you really laid out more than I've ever heard you talk about on air.
[02:38:11.005 --> 02:38:14.767]  For people that don't know the back side, Nick approached you, he tried to recruit you,
[02:38:15.728 --> 02:38:17.770]  And I've talked to Dr. Dennis Cuddy and others.
[02:38:17.770 --> 02:38:25.158]  You'll be in line when you're a sophomore with top grades at a university and suddenly David Rockefeller's in line with his lunch recruiting you.
[02:38:25.158 --> 02:38:28.041]  They're in control because they work long hours.
[02:38:28.041 --> 02:38:31.665]  They recruit people who they know are intelligent and have that spark.
[02:38:32.205 --> 02:38:34.966]  They've tried to recruit me, but through corporations.
[02:38:34.966 --> 02:38:36.887]  It's just like a meeting with the devil, folks.
[02:38:36.887 --> 02:38:38.208]  Here's the millions of dollars.
[02:38:38.208 --> 02:38:38.948]  Join us.
[02:38:38.948 --> 02:38:40.829]  The new order's real.
[02:38:40.829 --> 02:38:44.631]  But hey, those dumb people, they don't want your help anyway.
[02:38:44.631 --> 02:38:46.012]  And blah, blah, blah.
[02:38:46.012 --> 02:38:47.492]  Same deal.
[02:38:47.492 --> 02:38:51.534]  And so literally, folks, it's like the old parable.
[02:38:51.534 --> 02:38:53.655]  Tell folks that story.
[02:38:53.655 --> 02:38:59.578]  Well, what happened was I had done a video called Aaron Russo's Mad As Hell.
[02:39:02.596 --> 02:39:08.641]  It was the first time I went in front of the camera myself.
[02:39:08.641 --> 02:39:12.163]  It was Aaron Russo ranting about what was happening in government.
[02:39:12.163 --> 02:39:22.050]  And through making that video, people in Nevada saw it and really liked it, and they invited me to come to Nevada to speak.
[02:39:22.050 --> 02:39:26.213]  And I hadn't done that before, and I went there, and they told me there were 25 or 35 people in a room.
[02:39:26.213 --> 02:39:27.674]  When I went there, there were 350 people there.
[02:39:30.498 --> 02:39:34.759]  And they had to open and take the walls in the hotel apart and bring more chairs in.
[02:39:34.759 --> 02:39:37.100]  It was a very big success.
[02:39:37.100 --> 02:39:41.642]  And then I went to Las Vegas and we had over a thousand people come see me speak.
[02:39:41.642 --> 02:39:43.702]  And it was very, very successful.
[02:39:43.702 --> 02:39:47.024]  And out of that, they asked me to run for Governor of Nevada.
[02:39:47.024 --> 02:39:50.465]  And long story short, I decided to do it.
[02:39:50.465 --> 02:39:55.246]  And I got a call one day from an attorney woman I knew.
[02:39:55.246 --> 02:39:59.028]  And she said, would you like to meet one of the Rockefellers?
[02:39:59.028 --> 02:39:59.968]  I said, sure, I'd love to.
[02:40:00.789 --> 02:40:04.710]  And we arranged to have a lunch and the relationship started.
[02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:09.632]  And we became friends and he was a very, very brilliant man.
[02:40:09.632 --> 02:40:11.432]  Very, very smart.
[02:40:11.432 --> 02:40:17.354]  And we used to talk about philosophies and life and what I felt about life and what he felt.
[02:40:17.354 --> 02:40:21.235]  And he began to divulge a lot of things to me.
[02:40:21.235 --> 02:40:26.176]  And it was almost like, I compare it to like two brothers in the Civil War.
[02:40:26.176 --> 02:40:28.037]  One's on the North, one's on the South, you know.
[02:40:28.764 --> 02:40:33.567]  They were brothers but they had different views about life.
[02:40:33.567 --> 02:40:40.710]  I began to understand their point of view and where they were coming from and I made it very clear where I stood and where I was coming from.
[02:40:40.710 --> 02:40:47.794]  They tried to recruit me and asked me if I was interested in joining the Council on Foreign Relations or going into business.
[02:40:47.794 --> 02:40:52.696]  They were opening up a series of nightclubs that I could own and just different things.
[02:40:52.696 --> 02:40:57.459]  He would ask me questions about how I felt about the population of the area.
[02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:00.221]  You know, are there too many people here?
[02:41:00.221 --> 02:41:03.141]  And, you know, we had many conversations.
[02:41:03.141 --> 02:41:09.923]  One of the conversations, um... Well, let's go back to the population, because he said a number they wanted to get it down to.
[02:41:09.923 --> 02:41:16.224]  Well, what he said was, if I recall it exactly, they wanted to cut it down by a third to a half, the population there.
[02:41:16.224 --> 02:41:18.285]  And how did I feel about that?
[02:41:18.285 --> 02:41:20.806]  You know, and I said, well, who can decide who's going to live and die?
[02:41:20.806 --> 02:41:21.246]  You?
[02:41:21.246 --> 02:41:22.306]  Who's going to decide that?
[02:41:23.004 --> 02:41:23.885]  You know, how could you be?
[02:41:23.885 --> 02:41:44.981]  I mean, I think there are a lot of people in the area that, you know, but I don't think you have the right to decide who's going to kill anybody else or to eliminate the population, you know, and so we had that, that was, that really wasn't an in-depth conversation, but what was in-depth, you know, he told me the story about women's liberation, you know, he told me the story, you know, about how,
[02:41:46.721 --> 02:41:49.663]  There was going to be an event.
[02:41:49.663 --> 02:41:52.084]  Well, let's walk through each one.
[02:41:52.084 --> 02:41:59.628]  Let's do the Women's Liberation, and then let's get into the 9-11 issue, because you went further on that as well.
[02:41:59.628 --> 02:42:01.128]  Okay.
[02:42:01.128 --> 02:42:10.073]  Well, the Women's Liberation issue, he was at my house one evening, and we were talking, and he used to tell me, you know, Aaron, when I come to your house, I can have a relax.
[02:42:10.911 --> 02:42:18.054]  You know, and he used to come there and he'd relax, take off his shoes, and we used to laugh and talk and share ideas and thoughts.
[02:42:18.054 --> 02:42:23.297]  And so he said to me one night, he said, what do you think the Women's Liberation Movement was about?
[02:42:23.297 --> 02:42:28.259]  And I said, I thought it was about women having equal rights with men and equal pay.
[02:42:28.259 --> 02:42:33.281]  And, you know, I thought it was, at the time, I thought it was a fairly noble idea.
[02:42:33.281 --> 02:42:34.162]  And he laughed at me.
[02:42:34.162 --> 02:42:35.963]  He says, you know, you're an idiot.
[02:42:35.963 --> 02:42:37.523]  I said, why am I an idiot?
[02:42:37.523 --> 02:42:39.064]  He said, let me tell you what that was really about.
[02:42:40.103 --> 02:42:44.485]  And he said, look, we at the Rockefeller Foundation pretty much financed the Women's Liberation Movement.
[02:42:44.485 --> 02:42:50.668]  We helped get a press and public attention and so on and so forth.
[02:42:50.668 --> 02:42:54.149]  And he said there were two reasons why we did that.
[02:42:54.149 --> 02:42:55.790]  And I said, well, what were the reasons?
[02:42:55.790 --> 02:43:02.233]  And he said, the first reason was we couldn't tax half the population before, which we can now tax.
[02:43:02.233 --> 02:43:07.015]  And the second reason was now we get the kids at an early age in our schools because it breaks up the family.
[02:43:07.015 --> 02:43:08.776]  Now the women's working, the man's working.
[02:43:09.332 --> 02:43:11.194]  The kids have to go to public schools.
[02:43:11.194 --> 02:43:12.154]  We get to educate them.
[02:43:12.154 --> 02:43:14.276]  We get to indoctrinate them how to think.
[02:43:14.276 --> 02:43:14.937]  We raise them.
[02:43:14.937 --> 02:43:17.399]  They look at the state as the parent.
[02:43:17.399 --> 02:43:20.961]  And that's why we really push so hard for women to live.
[02:43:20.961 --> 02:43:25.966]  And it blew my mind because it never occurred to me that that could be the reason behind it, you know?
[02:43:25.966 --> 02:43:31.190]  And it just freaked me out how clever and smart they were to achieve their goals and their aims.
[02:43:31.190 --> 02:43:36.014]  And the way they did it in the back door, and yet it seemed very noble on the surface.
[02:43:36.014 --> 02:43:37.435]  It seemed like a positive thing, you know?
[02:43:39.881 --> 02:43:43.942]  So that really was a mind-opener for me.
[02:43:43.942 --> 02:43:47.582]  But you really went into detail then on the 9-11 thing 11 months before.
[02:43:47.582 --> 02:43:50.763]  I mean, this was really funny to him.
[02:43:50.763 --> 02:43:52.883]  Break that down for us, please.
[02:43:52.883 --> 02:43:56.544]  Well, what happened was that he was talking to me.
[02:43:56.544 --> 02:43:59.685]  He said that there's going to be an event there.
[02:43:59.685 --> 02:44:03.265]  And out of that event, you're going to see we're going to go into Afghanistan.
[02:44:03.265 --> 02:44:05.246]  So we're going to run pipelines from the Caspian Sea.
[02:44:05.246 --> 02:44:06.586]  We're going to go into Iraq.
[02:44:07.267 --> 02:44:23.292]  To take the oil and establish a base in the Middle East, and to push the New World Order, and to create a situation where we control the Middle East, and establish bases there, big bases there, and we're going to go into Venezuela, and try to get rid of Chavez.
[02:44:23.292 --> 02:44:34.376]  And the first two they've accomplished, Chavez they didn't accomplish, and you're going to see guys going to caves looking for people that they're never going to find.
[02:44:35.388 --> 02:44:38.590]  And he was laughing about it.
[02:44:38.590 --> 02:44:41.551]  It was so silly.
[02:44:41.551 --> 02:44:44.792]  He was laughing about the fact that you have this war on terror.
[02:44:44.792 --> 02:44:46.573]  There's no real enemy.
[02:44:46.573 --> 02:44:51.996]  And yet, there's a war going on, and you convince everybody to give up their civil rights and their civil liberties.
[02:44:51.996 --> 02:44:54.117]  And so he's going to be looking through caves for people.
[02:44:55.845 --> 02:44:57.926]  And yet, there's nothing real happening.
[02:44:57.926 --> 02:45:03.587]  Now, did he specifically say, ha ha, there's not a real war, it's all, it's a perfect enemy, never can be defeated?
[02:45:03.587 --> 02:45:04.168]  Exactly.
[02:45:04.168 --> 02:45:11.210]  It's like, it's like, you know, he was just laughing about how silly it was, but then everybody's gonna buy it and buy into it.
[02:45:11.210 --> 02:45:11.630]  You know?
[02:45:11.630 --> 02:45:12.590]  No, they laugh at us.
[02:45:12.590 --> 02:45:15.771]  I mean, it's like jet fuel brought down the towers, ha ha ha.
[02:45:15.771 --> 02:45:19.172]  I mean, you know, it's real funny how stupid everybody is.
[02:45:19.172 --> 02:45:23.853]  And that's the thing, folks, we're here telling you they're laughing at you, and they're cold-blooded people.
[02:45:23.853 --> 02:45:25.554]  Then he went into the microchip, didn't he?
[02:45:27.249 --> 02:45:29.331]  Well, that was another part of the story.
[02:45:29.331 --> 02:45:47.206]  That came a little bit later, but back on the war thing, it was like he was talking about how by having this war on terror, you can never win it, because it's an eternal war, and so you can always keep taking people's liberties away.
[02:45:47.206 --> 02:45:49.608]  And I said, how are you going to convince people that this war is real?
[02:45:49.608 --> 02:45:51.209]  He said, but the media.
[02:45:51.209 --> 02:45:52.851]  The media can convince everybody it's real.
[02:45:53.874 --> 02:46:00.278]  You know, it's just that you keep talking about things, you keep saying it over and over and over again, and eventually people believe it!
[02:46:00.278 --> 02:46:01.678]  And that's what it is!
[02:46:01.678 --> 02:46:04.740]  You know, I mean, the war on terror is a farce!
[02:46:04.740 --> 02:46:22.650]  Now, now... I mean, what really happened is, you know, you created the Federal Reserve in 1913 through lies, you know, you created the Social Security thing through lies, again, so they created Social Security, they said your number will never be used for identification, which was another lie,
[02:46:23.354 --> 02:46:28.595]  You know, you create 9-11, you know, which is another lie.
[02:46:28.595 --> 02:46:34.517]  Do 9-11, then you're fighting a war on terror, and now all of a sudden you go into Iraq, which was another lie.
[02:46:34.517 --> 02:46:38.078]  That wasn't about terror, that was about taking out Iraq.
[02:46:38.078 --> 02:46:38.478]  You know?
[02:46:38.478 --> 02:46:41.979]  And phony things about weapons of mass destruction.
[02:46:41.979 --> 02:46:43.039]  And now they're gonna do Iran.
[02:46:43.826 --> 02:46:47.287]  You know, and it's all one thing leading to another, leading to another, leading to another.
[02:46:47.287 --> 02:46:49.308]  It's all based on lies.
[02:46:49.308 --> 02:46:50.188]  Absolutely.
[02:46:50.188 --> 02:46:54.210]  You also talked to him, and I want to get into the microchip thing lastly, and we'll take some calls.
[02:46:54.210 --> 02:46:58.151]  You also talked about, you know, you said, hey, these are people and we're hurting them.
[02:46:58.151 --> 02:46:59.511]  This will be bad.
[02:46:59.511 --> 02:47:02.392]  And he was basically saying, oh, who cares about them?
[02:47:02.392 --> 02:47:03.453]  Only care about yourself.
[02:47:03.453 --> 02:47:05.033]  Can you relay that?
[02:47:05.033 --> 02:47:08.994]  Well, what it was was, you know, I said, you know, I would say to him, what are you doing this for?
[02:47:08.994 --> 02:47:10.375]  What's the point of this thing?
[02:47:10.375 --> 02:47:12.376]  You have all the money in the world you ever want.
[02:47:12.376 --> 02:47:13.316]  You have all the power.
[02:47:13.846 --> 02:47:17.387]  I said, you know, it's about the... I said, you know, you're hurting people.
[02:47:17.387 --> 02:47:19.887]  It's just not a good thing.
[02:47:19.887 --> 02:47:22.388]  And he would say, what do you care about the people for?
[02:47:22.388 --> 02:47:24.829]  Take care of yourself and take care of your family.
[02:47:24.829 --> 02:47:26.729]  It's about you and your family.
[02:47:26.729 --> 02:47:31.050]  Get on the right side of the situation and take care of yourself and your family.
[02:47:31.050 --> 02:47:34.991]  And, uh, you know, and it was also like, don't try and be logical.
[02:47:34.991 --> 02:47:40.312]  He would say to me, don't be logical, you know, because logic doesn't work.
[02:47:40.312 --> 02:47:43.173]  And, um, you know, it's sort of like war is peace, you know?
[02:47:44.340 --> 02:47:46.281]  Nothing makes any sense.
[02:47:46.281 --> 02:47:51.623]  And then I said, what are the ultimate goals here?
[02:47:51.623 --> 02:48:01.188]  He said, the ultimate goal is to get everybody in this room chipped with an RFID chip and have all money be on those chips and everything on those chips.
[02:48:01.188 --> 02:48:06.710]  And if anybody wants to protest what we do or violate what we want, we just turn off their chip.
[02:48:06.710 --> 02:48:07.791]  And they can't buy anything.
[02:48:07.791 --> 02:48:08.691]  They can't do anything.
[02:48:09.252 --> 02:48:10.133]  And that's what it's about.
[02:48:10.133 --> 02:48:20.401]  A government run by the institutions and the bankers of the world, and everybody in the world being chipped, and they're controlling everything.
[02:48:20.401 --> 02:48:21.662]  They're controlling the game.
[02:48:21.662 --> 02:48:27.826]  Where you can go, where you can travel, whether you go into the country or not.
[02:48:27.826 --> 02:48:31.509]  And he said that if you got pulled over though, the chip will say the cops leave you alone.
[02:48:31.509 --> 02:48:32.190]  Oh, that's funny.
[02:48:32.190 --> 02:48:33.671]  He said, what do you care?
[02:48:33.671 --> 02:48:36.073]  If you have a chip, I don't think a chip will say KMA on it.
[02:48:37.867 --> 02:48:39.908]  And he was sort of laughing when he said that.
[02:48:39.908 --> 02:48:41.569]  And I said, what's KMA?
[02:48:41.569 --> 02:48:43.329]  And he said, kiss my ass.
[02:48:43.329 --> 02:48:46.491]  And so he got pulled over, and it says KMA on it.
[02:48:46.491 --> 02:48:51.833]  And I don't think he really meant KMA, but there would be something in there that would let you know you were one of the special people.
[02:48:51.833 --> 02:49:00.777]  Yeah, now, well, the Homeland Security head in the red when he was in said, our ID cards will have four levels of security, and the green one is leave you alone, or maybe a level even above that.
[02:49:00.777 --> 02:49:04.459]  Now, obviously, anyone who's like this guy, this elite,
[02:49:05.385 --> 02:49:08.207]  I mean, no one could trust an elite like this to be a member of it.
[02:49:08.207 --> 02:49:10.068]  They're all backstabbing each other, too.
[02:49:10.068 --> 02:49:12.489]  I mean, this is nightmarish.
[02:49:12.489 --> 02:49:13.010]  It is.
[02:49:13.010 --> 02:49:20.934]  I mean, I saw that, because I remember he was having problems within his own family, you know, about power struggles that were going on.
[02:49:20.934 --> 02:49:21.775]  Oh, you never told me.
[02:49:21.775 --> 02:49:23.356]  Oh, tell us about that.
[02:49:23.356 --> 02:49:24.556]  I don't know that much about it.
[02:49:24.556 --> 02:49:25.137]  I really don't know.
[02:49:25.137 --> 02:49:25.877]  Well, what did he say?
[02:49:25.877 --> 02:49:28.019]  He just said, I'm having power struggles?
[02:49:28.019 --> 02:49:29.920]  Yeah, power struggles going on within the family.
[02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:30.840]  Who's going to take over?
[02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:32.641]  Who's going to be next in line?
[02:49:32.641 --> 02:49:33.662]  Things like that, you know.
[02:49:35.282 --> 02:49:40.168]  I don't know all the details about it, but I was very close with Nick.
[02:49:40.168 --> 02:49:43.752]  In the end, when I didn't go along with everything, he tried to screw me.
[02:49:51.619 --> 02:49:54.021]  And I just walked away from it, you know?
[02:49:54.021 --> 02:49:56.764]  And I did what I do, and he does what he does.
[02:49:56.764 --> 02:50:01.989]  But I tell you, that's got to make the New World Order really real for you to actually have them try to recruit you.
[02:50:01.989 --> 02:50:16.023]  Similar things have happened to me, and I mean, that's when it really comes home to you when they're there in suits with money, saying, yes, it's real, but we know best, the people don't know how to run their own lives, no more New World Order, come be a fake Rush Limbaugh.
[02:50:16.403 --> 02:50:17.604]  And I told them no.
[02:50:17.604 --> 02:50:18.584]  I mean, they're not playing games.
[02:50:18.584 --> 02:50:19.605]  Folks, this stuff's real.
[02:50:19.605 --> 02:50:20.585]  It is real.
[02:50:20.585 --> 02:50:22.666]  And they do it all with a nod and a wink.
[02:50:22.666 --> 02:50:24.867]  You know, nothing goes in writing.
[02:50:24.867 --> 02:50:26.968]  They do it all with a nod and a wink.
[02:50:26.968 --> 02:50:28.529]  You know, everybody knows what they're doing.
[02:50:28.529 --> 02:50:29.349]  It's all understood.
[02:50:29.349 --> 02:50:32.791]  But very little of it ever goes in writing.
[02:50:32.791 --> 02:50:34.952]  So you can find out.
[02:50:34.952 --> 02:50:39.715]  I mean, imagine all these private bankers controlling the money of this country.
[02:50:39.715 --> 02:50:40.375]  It's a farce.
[02:50:41.013 --> 02:50:41.673]  It's a farce.
[02:50:41.673 --> 02:50:42.594]  It's a joke.
[02:50:42.594 --> 02:50:43.434]  They print the money.
[02:50:43.434 --> 02:50:44.255]  They make the money.
[02:50:44.255 --> 02:50:45.035]  It's a joke.
[02:50:45.035 --> 02:50:45.656]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:50:45.656 --> 02:50:46.676]  They create it out of thin air.
[02:50:46.676 --> 02:50:47.797]  They buy whatever they want to buy.
[02:50:47.797 --> 02:50:49.278]  They buy the politicians.
[02:50:49.278 --> 02:50:52.460]  There's no difference between John McCain and Hillary Clinton.
[02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:52.840]  You know?
[02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:55.422]  Which one's going to become the president?
[02:50:55.422 --> 02:50:56.282]  Rudy Giuliani?
[02:50:56.282 --> 02:50:58.263]  It's all the same crap.
[02:50:58.263 --> 02:50:58.543]  You know?
[02:51:00.120 --> 02:51:01.000]  And that's what it is.
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.982]  And we're stuck with it unless we decide to do something about it.
[02:51:03.982 --> 02:51:06.103]  America, Freedom to Fascism exposes them.

[02:51:12.426 --> 02:51:14.127]  Final segment.
[02:51:14.127 --> 02:51:16.748]  We'll go to Dave, Rick and Jeff quickly.
[02:51:16.748 --> 02:51:21.050]  All three of you who get about a 30-45 second question or comment, then Aaron will comment.
[02:51:21.050 --> 02:51:22.531]  We're going to end this transmission.
[02:51:22.531 --> 02:51:24.212]  Another great interview with Aaron Russo.
[02:51:24.212 --> 02:51:24.612]  Stay with us.
[02:51:33.667 --> 02:51:39.490]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:39.490 --> 02:51:47.133]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:47.819 --> 02:51:55.282]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:55.282 --> 02:52:07.006]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police fortune, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:07.006 --> 02:52:10.967]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:10.967 --> 02:52:13.228]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:13.228 --> 02:52:17.069]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:53:38.566 --> 02:53:42.107]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[02:54:36.941 --> 02:54:38.681]  Final segment.
[02:54:38.681 --> 02:54:40.382]  An hour is not enough with Aaron Russo.
[02:54:40.382 --> 02:54:44.223]  We appreciate him doing the interview Saturday and coming on today.
[02:54:44.223 --> 02:54:46.864]  Now you know the full extent of what he's facing.
[02:54:46.864 --> 02:54:48.344]  Be sure and support him and pray for him.
[02:54:49.267 --> 02:54:56.012]  Aaron, I want to tell you, I always considered you a friend, known you for years via the telephone, but it's been great getting a chance to meet you and your wife.
[02:54:56.012 --> 02:54:57.633]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:54:57.633 --> 02:54:58.293]  I appreciate it.
[02:54:58.293 --> 02:55:00.695]  And vice versa, I feel the same way.
[02:55:00.695 --> 02:55:01.216]  I really do.
[02:55:01.216 --> 02:55:11.543]  You know, there's a bunch of us in this movement who want to change things and we have to give each other the respect and work together and create a synergy amongst the public and make things happen.
[02:55:11.543 --> 02:55:17.187]  That's another reason I like you, is you're not an egomaniac and you're a team player and you're focused on defeating the New World Order.
[02:55:17.187 --> 02:55:18.748]  We need more people like you, Aaron Russo.
[02:55:19.486 --> 02:55:21.527]  Thank you, I appreciate that very much.
[02:55:21.527 --> 02:55:24.689]  Dave in Michigan, you're on the air with Aaron Russo, go ahead.
[02:55:24.689 --> 02:55:32.574]  Hi Aaron, in your movie there's people like John Turner, Joe Bannister, and Sherry Jackson, all former employees of the IRS.
[02:55:32.574 --> 02:55:33.174]  Yes.
[02:55:33.174 --> 02:55:42.400]  At some point in the movie they state that they have not continued to file for their taxes, yet earlier in the program you stated that you wouldn't recommend not filing.
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:43.981]  I'm wondering, how are they going about this?
[02:55:44.514 --> 02:55:46.355]  Well, I didn't file last year.
[02:55:46.355 --> 02:55:47.096]  I mean, let me comment.
[02:55:47.096 --> 02:55:50.378]  They prosecuted Bannister and the jury said not guilty.
[02:55:50.378 --> 02:55:54.842]  The thing is, the danger... I mean, people are now winning in court because the proof's out.
[02:55:54.842 --> 02:55:59.045]  But still, Aaron's saying he's not going to give you advice to do something that's dangerous.
[02:55:59.045 --> 02:56:02.687]  He's saying, here's the film, here's the info, you're a big boy, you make the decision.
[02:56:02.687 --> 02:56:03.768]  Aaron?
[02:56:03.768 --> 02:56:05.850]  Yeah, I mean, what I'm saying is very simple.
[02:56:05.850 --> 02:56:07.831]  That there is no law.
[02:56:07.831 --> 02:56:11.694]  The Supreme Court said that the IRS doesn't have the ability to tax your waiver.
[02:56:12.313 --> 02:56:12.593]  I don't
[02:56:27.493 --> 02:56:29.394]  You know, it's impossible for someone like myself
[02:56:57.032 --> 02:56:59.533]  Tell people not to pay, because people get hurt.
[02:56:59.533 --> 02:57:01.374]  You know, it's a decision everybody makes for themselves.
[02:57:01.374 --> 02:57:02.014]  You don't pay.
[02:57:02.014 --> 02:57:05.496]  You haven't paid since the 80s, right?
[02:57:05.496 --> 02:57:10.338]  You just have to know the information, what the truth is, and you decide for yourself what you want to do.
[02:57:10.338 --> 02:57:14.120]  Aaron, I mean, to be clear though, since they tried to scam you in 89, you haven't paid.
[02:57:14.120 --> 02:57:14.520]  I haven't.
[02:57:14.520 --> 02:57:16.021]  I never said that, Alex.
[02:57:16.021 --> 02:57:17.741]  Well, I'm guessing then.
[02:57:17.741 --> 02:57:18.442]  Don't guess.
[02:57:18.442 --> 02:57:21.923]  I don't want to get into what I do, because I don't want to recommend anything to anybody else.
[02:57:21.923 --> 02:57:22.464]  I understand.
[02:57:22.464 --> 02:57:23.064]  I understand.
[02:57:23.675 --> 02:57:24.856]  Well then, I mean, you never told me what you did.
[02:57:24.856 --> 02:57:29.000]  I'm just guessing that after they tried to scam you, you know, that you... I mean, you did leave the country.
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:30.761]  I guess that's one way to get away from them.
[02:57:30.761 --> 02:57:32.783]  No, I didn't leave the country for that reason.
[02:57:32.783 --> 02:57:36.486]  But now, now they try to follow you outside the country.
[02:57:36.486 --> 02:57:44.834]  Yeah, well, American citizens, and I think Filipinos, and people that no matter where you live, you owe money to that country, even if you don't live it or make it there.
[02:57:44.834 --> 02:57:45.414]  That's sick.
[02:57:45.414 --> 02:57:47.176]  Okay, Dave, thanks for the call.
[02:57:47.176 --> 02:57:48.156]  Rick and Reno, quickly.
[02:57:48.156 --> 02:57:48.657]  Go ahead, Rick.
[02:57:50.006 --> 02:57:54.987]  I'm calling to promise prayer for Mr. Russo and to ask you and your audience to do the same.
[02:57:54.987 --> 02:57:56.527]  Yeah, well, I've already prayed for him.
[02:57:56.527 --> 02:57:57.747]  We should all pray for him to get better.
[02:57:57.747 --> 02:57:58.928]  Yeah, Aaron, we need you.
[02:57:58.928 --> 02:58:00.448]  We know you're going to get better.
[02:58:00.448 --> 02:58:00.808]  Thank you.
[02:58:00.808 --> 02:58:03.408]  I feel very confident that I'm going to beat this thing.
[02:58:03.408 --> 02:58:05.689]  And Rick, thank you very much for your prayers.
[02:58:05.689 --> 02:58:07.509]  I really appreciate that very much.
[02:58:07.509 --> 02:58:08.369]  It means a lot to me.
[02:58:08.369 --> 02:58:10.189]  It really does.
[02:58:10.189 --> 02:58:12.050]  Anything else, Rick?
[02:58:12.050 --> 02:58:13.090]  I guess he's gone.
[02:58:13.090 --> 02:58:13.930]  Jeff in Michigan.
[02:58:13.930 --> 02:58:15.850]  I know you're on another subject, but go ahead quickly.
[02:58:15.850 --> 02:58:19.211]  Yeah, I just wanted to say I'm a cancer survivor also.
[02:58:19.813 --> 02:58:22.915]  And I was told yesterday I might have some more, but I ain't worried about that.
[02:58:22.915 --> 02:58:34.964]  But I did want to say that it was, I think it was December 23rd, when a McClatchy News Service reported the CIA is paying the Somalian warlord that killed our troops money to fight the Muslims there.
[02:58:34.964 --> 02:58:35.604]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:58:35.604 --> 02:58:36.805]  In fact, I saw that article.
[02:58:36.805 --> 02:58:39.206]  I've got to dig that back out and cover it.
[02:58:39.206 --> 02:58:40.407]  Yeah, it's sick!
[02:58:40.407 --> 02:58:45.631]  And Alex, I ran for office, and I was defeated, and IRS was all over me like,
[02:58:48.260 --> 02:58:49.681]  Call me back tomorrow and tell me more.
[02:58:49.681 --> 02:58:55.967]  Aaron, I want to commend you and thank you for all your work in making America free from fascism.
[02:58:55.967 --> 02:58:58.550]  I do think it's the most important work you've done in your life.
[02:58:58.550 --> 02:58:59.590]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:58:59.590 --> 02:59:00.631]  It's a pleasure.
[02:59:00.631 --> 02:59:03.054]  I enjoyed doing your show, talking to you.
[02:59:03.054 --> 02:59:04.235]  We'll figure everything out.
[02:59:04.235 --> 02:59:07.978]  And American people, please, stand up and fight back.
[02:59:07.978 --> 02:59:08.519]  Absolutely.
[02:59:08.519 --> 02:59:08.999]  God bless.
[02:59:08.999 --> 02:59:09.440]  Stay there, Aaron.
[02:59:10.543 --> 02:59:16.827]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[02:59:16.827 --> 02:59:24.851]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:59:24.851 --> 02:59:25.572]  are located?
[02:59:25.572 --> 02:59:29.174]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:59:29.174 --> 02:59:34.177]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:59:34.177 --> 02:59:39.180]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
