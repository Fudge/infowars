[00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:09.755]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:11.236]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:12.937]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.538 --> 00:00:17.340]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:21.824]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:42.100]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.540]  Welcome.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.362]  Thank you so much for joining us on this fourth day already.
[00:00:47.382 --> 00:00:52.265]  Hard to believe that it's already the fourth day.
[00:00:53.328 --> 00:00:59.233]  of December 2007, and we're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:18.788]  In top stories for you, ex-Italian president, intel agencies know 9-1-1, an inside job, man who blew the whistle on Gladio, tells Italy's largest newspaper, attacks were run by CIA Mossad.
[00:01:19.855 --> 00:01:41.332]  Former Italian President and the man who revealed the existence of Operation Gladio, Francisco Casiga, I believe I'm pronouncing that right, has gone public on 9-1-1 telling Italy's most respected newspaper that the attacks were run by the CIA and Mossad and that this was common knowledge amongst global intelligence agencies.
[00:01:42.593 --> 00:01:45.636]  He was also the former head of Italian's secret
[00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:52.432]  Police or intelligence agency, so we'll be breaking that down coming up.
[00:01:53.693 --> 00:01:57.656]  Also a great story by Steve Watson at Infowars.net.
[00:01:58.216 --> 00:02:05.962]  Dear diluted mass media, North American Union agenda exists, and in seven pages it walks through the detailed facts.
[00:02:06.643 --> 00:02:08.584]  Also in Tampa, Florida, U.S.
[00:02:08.664 --> 00:02:13.448]  drug jar John Walters in Tampa, touting local programs aimed at stopping students.
[00:02:13.568 --> 00:02:14.849]  The feds in Florida
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:31.136]  Telling a program stopping students from using and abusing prescription drugs, and it says they're doing random drug testings, federally funded, as if random drug testing or compulsory drug testing violating the Fourth Amendment isn't bad enough.
[00:02:31.377 --> 00:02:34.460]  Now the feds are involved in all of that.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.244]  Another story here, hearing impaired man tasered by police.
[00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:43.730]  Bush keeps up pressure on Tehran as a new U.S.
[00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.130]  government report mirrors a U.N.
[00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.592]  report saying that their nuclear program is peaceful.
[00:02:50.972 --> 00:02:54.714]  And the Iranian president says he welcomes the U.S.
[00:02:54.814 --> 00:02:55.794]  nuclear report.
[00:02:57.034 --> 00:02:59.795]  Anger as fines from speed cameras soar.
[00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:04.777]  And I heard Derry Brownfield this morning here on the Genesis Network
[00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:21.694]  Talking about how wolves are stalking children in New Mexico, coming on school playgrounds, they're having to lock down schools, they're having to, in Albuquerque and surrounding areas, build wolf shelters by the bus stops where the kids have to run in enclosed metal doors so the wolves don't eat them.
[00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:29.156]  And there's this popular conception by a lot of, even informed people, they're sweet and loving and just lick and kiss on you.
[00:03:29.716 --> 00:03:31.037]  So we Google attacks.
[00:03:31.057 --> 00:03:32.297]  We have them attacking people from
[00:03:33.308 --> 00:03:37.771]  Alaska to India, killing dogs of their own yard, coyotes eating your cats and dogs.
[00:03:38.152 --> 00:03:44.336]  You're gonna have to decide whether you like your geese by your pond if you're in the country, or dogs, or your cats, or your children.
[00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:59.788]  Every six months or so, I say a couple a year, cougars, mountain lions, pumas, whatever name you want to give them, from California to Florida to Idaho, grab children and small women.
[00:03:59.908 --> 00:04:01.589]  They don't usually attack males.
[00:04:03.092 --> 00:04:15.817]  And in fact, some forestry workers, even out in California and Oregon, when they're out, especially women, they'll wear a mask on the back of their head because they only sneak up behind you.
[00:04:16.038 --> 00:04:19.939]  These smaller cats, they're huge, but they're not as big as a tiger or a lion.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.001]  And the puma kills people all the time.
[00:04:25.112 --> 00:04:26.932]  And, uh, their numbers are exploding everywhere.
[00:04:26.952 --> 00:04:28.593]  I have seen one out in East Texas.
[00:04:28.713 --> 00:04:31.073]  My dad has seen them on our little family farm.
[00:04:31.593 --> 00:04:33.513]  I've been out in California and other areas.
[00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:38.714]  Every time I'm on a road trip out there, the four or five I've taken, two or three pumas will jump across you at night.
[00:04:39.274 --> 00:04:40.155]  Beautiful cats.
[00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:43.715]  And I just thought I'd illustrate that they are killing us.
[00:04:44.155 --> 00:04:47.676]  And, uh, the wolves are now starting to enjoy themselves as well.
[00:04:48.636 --> 00:04:49.396]  They're not friendly.
[00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:50.056]  They're not nice.
[00:04:50.096 --> 00:04:50.656]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:56.617]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:56.637 --> 00:04:58.738]  A New World Order.
[00:04:59.438 --> 00:05:03.559]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:06.560]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.380]  Isn't their objective being world domination?
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.401]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:20.303]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of extenuating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:23.316 --> 00:05:28.298]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:28.758 --> 00:05:32.259]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:35.140]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.181]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:37.121]  They're not after money.
[00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:38.201]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:39.202]  They're after power.
[00:05:39.402 --> 00:05:40.402]  That's what they're after, you see.

[00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.772]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:06:54.182 --> 00:06:56.024]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:06:56.164 --> 00:07:01.348]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:07:01.508 --> 00:07:02.869]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:11.296]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:07:11.516 --> 00:07:17.261]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:19.203]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:07:19.263 --> 00:07:21.425]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:07:21.565 --> 00:07:25.829]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:07:25.989 --> 00:07:28.111]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:35.978]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:41.372]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:41.392 --> 00:07:44.055]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:07:44.235 --> 00:07:44.515]  Once a month,
[00:08:05.936 --> 00:08:11.919]  syndicated talk show host, and of course, the man who runs whatreallyhappens.com pops in for an hour.
[00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:16.582]  We have Michael Rivero joining us in at the second hour today.
[00:08:16.602 --> 00:08:26.247]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the father of Reaganomics, head of policy, Department of Treasury under Ronald Reagan, father of Reaganomics, former Wall Street Journal editor,
[00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:38.755]  We'll be joining us about some new reports he's got out dealing with the end of America, the end of the Republic, the total police state system being put in place right now.
[00:08:38.995 --> 00:08:46.599]  So we'll be talking to this esteemed economist coming up in about 25 minutes from now.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.701]  I have a compilation from PrisonPlanet.com
[00:08:51.545 --> 00:08:55.811]  Of different Ron Paul statements going back 30 years, 25 years, 10 years, and this year.
[00:08:58.917 --> 00:09:04.678]  That I want to play, so you can see where he's been on the economy all the time, all along.
[00:09:05.558 --> 00:09:11.359]  He was the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow, because it's sensible policies and historical information.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:19.721]  But before we do that, there's a trailer, you can call it a trailer, an ad, up on prisonplanet.com right now.
[00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:24.042]  Fox News won't run pro-Constitution ads.
[00:09:25.143 --> 00:09:33.228]  The Center for Constitutional Rights recently produced an ad called Rescue the Constitution that criticizes the Bush administration for destroying the Constitution.
[00:09:33.849 --> 00:09:35.690]  And of course, Naomi Wolf's involved with that as well.
[00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:49.290]  And it goes on to say, through the use of tactics like renditions, that's kidnapping and torture, Fox News is refusing to air the ad, claiming that it needs documentation that the Constitution is indeed being destroyed.
[00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.792]  And so here is the audio of the censored video.
[00:09:54.152 --> 00:09:58.274]  Anything that's censored, we need to work harder on getting out to the people.
[00:09:59.074 --> 00:10:02.976]  By the way, speaking of censor, for those that don't know, Digg is one of the top websites in the world.
[00:10:03.356 --> 00:10:04.857]  Tens of millions of viewers a day.
[00:10:06.204 --> 00:10:12.926]  For two months, the Berry Brigade over there, but there's been some computer experts that have done analysis and Dig admits it now.
[00:10:13.266 --> 00:10:14.746]  They first banned us in January.
[00:10:14.786 --> 00:10:15.986]  There was a big hue and cry.
[00:10:17.607 --> 00:10:26.069]  They then just started restricting us and using the Berry Brigade to block us nine times out of ten, but we still got millions of views and reads via that system.
[00:10:26.729 --> 00:10:32.891]  Now they have, because we've been able to look at the berries, we can get 1,505 hours.
[00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:34.411]  A hundred usually puts you on the main page.
[00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:38.452]  We can get 1,500, and we're blocked.
[00:10:38.692 --> 00:10:45.393]  Now, what really happened has been outright banned, just like we were 11 months ago.
[00:10:46.614 --> 00:10:55.716]  And so, we need to do a report on that at PrisonPlanet.com or TruthNews, about how we've been buried, about how we've been blocked, and what really happened has as well.
[00:10:56.276 --> 00:10:57.236]  Just another example.
[00:10:57.516 --> 00:11:01.557]  Wikipedia, we've been expunged from, I'd say, 90 plus percent of that.
[00:11:02.057 --> 00:11:04.458]  We've just been completely blasted and blown away there.
[00:11:05.118 --> 00:11:06.599]  We're getting blasted on hundreds of fronts.
[00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:07.419]  I'm only mentioning a few.
[00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:12.061]  Now, if you want to let them win and let them have their way, I guess we can all just crawl back in our holes.
[00:11:12.141 --> 00:11:13.702]  Or we can intensify our efforts.
[00:11:29.978 --> 00:11:30.979]  We can increase.
[00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:33.900]  Go in there and just go all over Digg.
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.561]  All over other stories they're doing.
[00:11:35.721 --> 00:11:37.422]  All over other reports they're doing.
[00:11:37.742 --> 00:11:43.045]  Other stories about video games and topless bars and football.
[00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:47.988]  And just blast them everywhere about their censorship and just in all their message boards.
[00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:50.189]  PrisonPlanet.com, TruthNews.
[00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:51.550]  I haven't called for this.
[00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.131]  Now I am.
[00:11:52.151 --> 00:11:54.852]  Just go in there and just hit them everywhere.
[00:11:54.952 --> 00:11:55.552]  Just blasting.
[00:11:56.773 --> 00:12:04.339]  Because they claim that they're this digital democracy and you can go on there and, you know, the stories get voted up to the main page and everyone will see them.
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.861]  And that's just not the case.
[00:12:06.421 --> 00:12:09.704]  Blast them with WhatReallyHappened.com and they'll censor that word.
[00:12:09.724 --> 00:12:17.290]  You'll have to add, like, a smiley face in between the .com, get around their spy bots and AI systems that, you know, go through and...
[00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:22.574]  There's ways to fool it for now, though they're starting to ban just whole combinations.
[00:12:23.174 --> 00:12:26.116]  Blast MySpace, just literally, it's an info war.
[00:12:26.536 --> 00:12:30.699]  Picture yourself just taking foxholes, throwing info hand grenades on them.
[00:12:30.939 --> 00:12:32.520]  When you move, it's unstoppable.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:38.864]  Go into all the other big Sean Hannity boards and Glenn Beck and just blast, blast, blast, never stop.
[00:12:39.745 --> 00:12:41.546]  Or we can just totally cement to these people.
[00:12:41.566 --> 00:12:51.473]  But see, these are venues where we can reach millions of new minds and wake them up to the threat of the North American Union, the open borders, the gun control, the attack on Iran.
[00:12:51.954 --> 00:12:58.298]  We're winning the info war, by the way, but they're trying to move in with censorship similar to what China did in the last decade with filtering.
[00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:00.200]  They're bringing in Chinese models.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.801]  And I'm not going to put up with it.
[00:13:02.101 --> 00:13:03.322]  I say go completely ape.
[00:13:04.105 --> 00:13:08.126]  And I say go get this video that's on YouTube at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:13:08.206 --> 00:13:10.147]  Fox News won't run pro-Constitution ad.
[00:13:10.507 --> 00:13:12.587]  And just go get this right now and email it to everybody.
[00:13:12.647 --> 00:13:13.328]  Not just us.
[00:13:13.608 --> 00:13:15.328]  Anything else gets censored, go crazy.
[00:13:15.688 --> 00:13:16.829]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:17.549 --> 00:13:23.631]  Some of these individuals are taken to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and have a fairly robust interrogation program without torture.
[00:13:23.731 --> 00:13:28.132]  If the Constitution doesn't say every citizen is a civil rights or any sort of civil rights offender, it doesn't say that.
[00:13:28.212 --> 00:13:29.792]  The United States does not torture.
[00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:31.853]  It's against our laws and it's against our values.
[00:13:34.238 --> 00:13:36.504]  No trials, no additions, no torture.
[00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:39.772]  The Bush Administration is destroying the Constitution.
[00:13:40.213 --> 00:13:41.215]  They can be stopped.
[00:13:41.997 --> 00:13:43.501]  Rescue the Constitution.
[00:13:45.942 --> 00:13:53.349]  And there's a website, Rescue the Constitution, and they say, well, you're not allowed to advertise the name of your organization because the Constitution doesn't need rescuing.
[00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:59.474]  Oh, no, just NSA openly admitting they're spying on non-care related cases domestically without warrants.
[00:13:59.574 --> 00:14:07.301]  Oh, just cameras in school bathrooms and, you know, checkpoints and FEMA camps and everybody getting tasered and just all of the stuff that's happening.
[00:14:07.642 --> 00:14:09.884]  No, no, and it's just everything's fine.
[00:14:10.024 --> 00:14:11.005]  America's just fine.
[00:14:11.525 --> 00:14:12.286]  There's no problem.
[00:14:13.504 --> 00:14:18.566]  We just have the Attorney General, former Attorney General, now testifying before the Senate and the House.
[00:14:18.886 --> 00:14:19.606]  We'll play it again.
[00:14:19.926 --> 00:14:25.148]  It's Gonzales in the middle, talking about how you just don't have any rights.
[00:14:25.188 --> 00:14:25.608]  Listen to him.
[00:14:26.248 --> 00:14:32.490]  Some of these individuals are taken to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and have a fairly robust interrogation program without torture.
[00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.051]  The Constitution doesn't say every citizen should be given a grant to provide torture.
[00:14:36.111 --> 00:14:36.812]  It doesn't say that.
[00:14:36.912 --> 00:14:38.492]  The United States does not torture.
[00:14:38.592 --> 00:14:40.533]  It's against our laws and it's against our values.
[00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:48.473]  When trials, renditions, torture, the Bush administration is destroying the Constitution.
[00:14:48.553 --> 00:14:49.893]  They can be stopped.
[00:14:50.674 --> 00:14:52.235]  Rescue the Constitution.
[00:14:53.356 --> 00:14:54.336]  And that's Danny Glover.
[00:14:54.356 --> 00:14:56.918]  It's a well-producible 30-second ad.
[00:14:57.658 --> 00:15:01.621]  And there's Gonzales saying citizens don't deserve habeas corpus.
[00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:02.781]  I mean, that's Magna Carta, 1215.
[00:15:04.733 --> 00:15:07.735]  That's the very basis of a due process of liberty, of freedom.
[00:15:07.935 --> 00:15:10.556]  That they can't just secretly grab you and drag you off to some nest.
[00:15:10.596 --> 00:15:20.941]  And then, we read the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, and the Military Commissions Act, and Presidential Decision Directive 51, and every major law scholar that looked at it said, this all affects U.S.
[00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:21.462]  citizens!
[00:15:22.022 --> 00:15:25.264]  This is to secretly arrest us, secretly torture us, secretly execute us.
[00:15:25.664 --> 00:15:26.384]  It says it all.
[00:15:26.904 --> 00:15:28.885]  And then the neocons go, it doesn't say that!
[00:15:29.626 --> 00:15:33.708]  But then they question Gonzales about it, and he goes, yeah, you can grab citizens without habeas corpus.
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.562]  We played those clips over and over again here.
[00:15:37.582 --> 00:15:39.883]  I said I'd play this Ron Paul clip.
[00:15:39.903 --> 00:15:42.746]  This is a little compilation of Ron Paul on the economy.
[00:15:42.766 --> 00:15:44.727]  This is leading into Dr. Roberts coming up.
[00:15:44.747 --> 00:15:45.068]  Here it is.
[00:15:45.088 --> 00:15:54.755]  The subject today is whether or not we should have a gold standard or whether we should follow the standard that we are using today and that is the discretionary paper standard.
[00:15:55.556 --> 00:16:03.262]  And obviously I support the idea that it would be wiser to have a gold standard rather than a paper standard.
[00:16:03.991 --> 00:16:09.496]  And I think that unfortunately for those who believe in the paper standard have one little problem.
[00:16:09.876 --> 00:16:11.978]  They have to defend what we have today.
[00:16:12.199 --> 00:16:20.586]  And they have to defend the soundness of the economy, the soundness of the dollars, and they have to explain why the interest rates are high and why the housing market is not doing so well.
[00:16:20.606 --> 00:16:22.308]  So I think they have a terrible job.
[00:16:22.928 --> 00:16:25.510]  When you destroy money, prices go up.
[00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:30.373]  When the government interferes in certain segments of the economy, those prices go up more rapidly.
[00:16:30.773 --> 00:16:39.419]  So when you see the cost of education and the cost of medicine going up faster than anything else, it's not because of the gouging procedure.
[00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:45.803]  It's due to the fact that government injects more money into these areas, but it's a failed system because it doesn't broaden the distribution.
[00:16:45.883 --> 00:16:49.425]  It only raises costs and, of course, the quality goes down.
[00:16:49.825 --> 00:16:52.726]  Well, no, you can't have a government like this without an income tax.
[00:16:52.746 --> 00:16:54.087]  We don't want a government like this.
[00:16:54.147 --> 00:16:57.968]  This is not the kind of government that was designed by our founders of the country.
[00:16:58.008 --> 00:16:59.728]  It's not what was written in the Constitution.
[00:16:59.748 --> 00:17:01.189]  We've only had an income tax since 1913.
[00:17:01.649 --> 00:17:15.674]  But if you want a welfare state, and if you want to police the world and pay for the defense of Japan and Germany, send foreign aid to the Soviet Union, you not only need the income tax, you need the Federal Reserve to print up the money when the deficit is accumulated.
[00:17:15.714 --> 00:17:17.855]  So we think the government should be much smaller.
[00:17:17.935 --> 00:17:18.875]  If government is small,
[00:17:19.856 --> 00:17:21.597]  That's right.
[00:17:21.697 --> 00:17:25.260]  And they want always to have Congress a way of financing.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:31.786]  So if they can't borrow enough money, they are going to go to the Fed and the Fed will monetize it and create the money.
[00:17:32.487 --> 00:17:40.394]  So it probably wasn't an accident, the fact that in 1913, the same year they gave us the Federal Reserve, they gave us an income tax.
[00:17:40.834 --> 00:17:44.915]  I'm more concerned about the way the 16th Amendment was passed, and I don't think it was technically correct.
[00:17:56.959 --> 00:18:01.724]  Hey, Mr. Bannister's correct and technically we shouldn't have to pay the income tax.
[00:18:02.144 --> 00:18:04.366]  It's just that I've chosen a different tactic.
[00:18:04.446 --> 00:18:11.172]  I think that we should change it in a more deliberate fashion and that's why I'm a legislator.
[00:18:12.313 --> 00:18:17.379]  There's a group that get together internationally and they sort of play God with our money.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.483]  That's part of what the George Bush show was the new world order?
[00:18:21.023 --> 00:18:26.429]  They can't have a new world order only with a world police or military.
[00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.352]  I think the financial system
[00:18:28.972 --> 00:18:36.299]  I consider the Federal Reserve Act and the creation of the Federal Reserve Act as being unconstitutional.
[00:18:36.399 --> 00:18:42.023]  It gave the government then the power to create legal tenure out of thin air.
[00:18:42.063 --> 00:18:43.565]  That is, to create paper money.
[00:18:43.645 --> 00:18:47.228]  And although they didn't do that overnight, between 1913 and 1971, that is exactly what happened.
[00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:54.414]  But the notion of a central bank does not fit into the Constitution.
[00:18:54.434 --> 00:19:00.258]  The Congress has the authority to coin money, and only gold and silver should be legal tender.
[00:19:01.534 --> 00:19:04.836]  Transparency and monetary policy is a goal we should all support.
[00:19:04.856 --> 00:19:11.558]  I've often wondered why Congress has so willingly given up this prerogative over monetary policy.
[00:19:11.978 --> 00:19:17.280]  Congress, in essence, has ceded total control of the value of our money to a secretive central bank.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.882]  Congress created the Federal Reserve, yet it had no constitutional authority to do so.
[00:19:22.462 --> 00:19:29.625]  We forget that those powers not explicitly granted to the Congress by the Constitution are inherently denied to the Congress.
[00:19:30.788 --> 00:19:32.449]  And there's more at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:19:32.469 --> 00:19:42.957]  When we get back, former Italian president and former head of their intelligence agency, Francisco Casca, has gone public saying 9-11 is an inside job.

[00:20:08.453 --> 00:20:14.579]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.

[00:20:30.974 --> 00:20:34.935]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:20:35.135 --> 00:20:41.678]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[00:22:54.432 --> 00:22:57.894]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:22:58.114 --> 00:23:00.236]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:23:00.376 --> 00:23:02.857]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:23:03.097 --> 00:23:07.460]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.181]  Here's why.
[00:23:08.581 --> 00:23:14.524]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:23:14.765 --> 00:23:20.768]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[00:23:20.988 --> 00:23:21.869]  But they're not cheating.
[00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:26.131]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:23:26.332 --> 00:23:30.674]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.

[00:23:47.321 --> 00:23:47.501]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.740]  You know what's happening?
[00:24:17.342 --> 00:24:21.724]  The New World Order cover-up is unraveling.
[00:24:22.825 --> 00:24:27.307]  It unraveled a long time ago, but it's really falling apart right now.
[00:24:27.327 --> 00:24:31.609]  And I'll tell you what made me happy.
[00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:37.072]  I was very happy to wake up this morning
[00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:51.256]  And learn that someone that we quote in Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, has gone completely public in a big way.
[00:24:51.276 --> 00:24:55.698]  And by the way, my wife speaks Italian, living six years in Rome.
[00:24:56.519 --> 00:25:06.723]  I am going to try to get her, she used to be my producer, she's a great producer, we've got a better shot getting French and Italian and Spanish guests on.
[00:25:07.971 --> 00:25:10.012]  I'm just saying this on air so I don't forget.
[00:25:10.032 --> 00:25:14.073]  I'm going to have her and everything else she's doing try to get this fellow on.
[00:25:14.113 --> 00:25:15.913]  Maybe she can even come in and interpret.
[00:25:16.313 --> 00:25:19.154]  But I'm told he speaks pretty good English as well.
[00:25:19.734 --> 00:25:23.355]  But yes, we're going to work on getting him on the show.
[00:25:23.895 --> 00:25:25.436]  And it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:25:25.476 --> 00:25:26.136]  It's a big deal.
[00:25:28.157 --> 00:25:29.177]  We have Robert Baird.
[00:25:30.868 --> 00:25:37.450]  Super high-level CIA field operative, very famous, movie Siriana about him, true story, saying that all the evidence points towards an inside job.
[00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:45.771]  Bill Christensen, former CIA section chief, Europe, going public, saying it's total inside job, that there's no doubt all the evidence conclusively points at that.
[00:25:47.272 --> 00:25:55.114]  And now we have hundreds of others, of course, but ex-Italian president, intel agencies know 9-11, an inside job.
[00:25:57.626 --> 00:26:25.767]  Man Who Blew The Whistle On Gladio Tells Italy's Largest Newspaper Attacks Were Run By CIA, Mossad, Former Italian President, And The Man Who Revealed The Existence Of Operation Gladio, Francisco Casca, Has Gone Public On 9-11, Telling Italy's Most Respected Newspaper That The Attacks Were Run By The CIA And Mossad, And That It Was Common Knowledge Amongst Global Intelligence Agencies.
[00:26:26.443 --> 00:26:38.635]  Costco was elected president of the Italian Senate in July 1983 before winning a landslide 1985 election to become president of the country in 1985.
[00:26:39.255 --> 00:26:50.446]  Costco gained respect from opposition parties as one of a rare breed, an honest politician.
[00:26:51.067 --> 00:26:53.508]  And led the country for seven years until April 1992.
[00:26:54.268 --> 00:26:58.069]  He's one of the most respected Italian presidents ever.
[00:26:58.669 --> 00:27:01.210]  I mean, they can have two or three presidents in a year in Italy.
[00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.491]  If you serve a year, that's a long time.
[00:27:03.531 --> 00:27:06.552]  It's a parliamentary system, and it's very volatile.
[00:27:07.172 --> 00:27:11.153]  And he is one of the longest-serving Italian presidents.
[00:27:12.134 --> 00:27:19.456]  In fact, he's the longest-serving since El Duce, or Mussolini.
[00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:33.140]  So a very, very long serving, ladies and gentlemen, from 1985 to 1992, seven years, and before that was the President of the Senate, and it says, uh,
[00:27:35.595 --> 00:27:36.176]  We're good to go!
[00:27:58.696 --> 00:28:01.918]  A rogue intelligence network under NATO, it was actually the U.S.
[00:28:01.938 --> 00:28:24.794]  carrying it out, Italy just stood by, and NATO's auspices carried out bombings across Europe in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, ending with the Bologna bombing in 1980, killing over 140 people, blowing up buses at the Bologna bus terminal, and he finally went public about that at the end of his presidency, and the government just went completely ape and didn't deny it, just said he had disclosed national security secrets.
[00:28:25.586 --> 00:28:40.521]  Man, he just, in fact, I've got the quotes in the news articles translated from Italian that we put in Endgame, and not in Endgame, in Terror Storm, and he just said, look, I can't continue to cover this up.
[00:28:40.581 --> 00:28:41.402]  I can't continue.
[00:28:41.802 --> 00:28:46.427]  This was the CIA in conjunction with the criminal groups they hired that staged this.
[00:28:47.961 --> 00:28:56.347]  Gladio's specialty was to carry out what they coined false flag operations, terror attacks that were blamed on the domestic and geopolitical opposition.
[00:28:57.608 --> 00:29:06.415]  Casca's revelations contributed to an Italian parliamentary investigation of Gladio in 2000, during which Ebrus was unearthed that the attacks were being overseen by U.S.
[00:29:06.435 --> 00:29:07.656]  intelligence apparatus.
[00:29:08.917 --> 00:29:10.318]  Yeah, so Paul, you might change that.
[00:29:10.358 --> 00:29:15.442]  I mean, he did say, I take credit, I'm bad, I knew about it and didn't expose it, but he came in after that.
[00:29:16.133 --> 00:29:29.876]  In March 2001, Gladio agent Vincenzo Vicoguerra stated in sworn testimony, you had to attack civilians, the people, women, children, innocent people, unknown people, far removed from any political game.
[00:29:30.136 --> 00:29:35.838]  The reason was quite simple, to force the public to turn to the state and ask for greater security.
[00:29:36.358 --> 00:29:41.979]  We'll finish up with this incredible article from PrisonPlanet.com and then we'll talk to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:29:45.319 --> 00:29:48.325]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:49.246 --> 00:29:51.951]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:55.386 --> 00:30:58.329]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:03.635]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:31:03.995 --> 00:31:09.280]  Even a fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[00:31:11.182 --> 00:31:20.246]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[00:33:19.046 --> 00:33:28.049]  Why not give them Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror that gets into Gladio and how the former Italian Prime Minister, who was the head of intelligence at the time, admits the U.S.
[00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:32.931]  staged terror attacks there in 1980 to blame it on the Communists?
[00:33:34.652 --> 00:33:39.174]  Why not get Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement that gets into this whole New World Order system?

[00:35:23.784 --> 00:35:25.345]  And we're just always honored.
[00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:27.246]  And he's also written some books.
[00:35:27.266 --> 00:35:29.688]  You can Google Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and check those out.
[00:35:30.408 --> 00:35:33.430]  It is such a great honor that he joins us once a month.
[00:35:34.051 --> 00:35:35.872]  And he's written several new articles.
[00:35:36.713 --> 00:35:38.033]  The Impending Destruction of the U.S.
[00:35:38.073 --> 00:35:38.554]  Economy.
[00:35:38.894 --> 00:35:41.776]  And another one, The Lies at the End of the American Dream.
[00:35:42.036 --> 00:35:44.838]  He's written these just in the last week or so.
[00:35:45.318 --> 00:35:47.359]  And here to help us
[00:35:49.086 --> 00:35:54.427]  Decipher, as a top economist, what's happening right now and his projections into the future.
[00:35:54.467 --> 00:35:55.547]  Dr. Roberts, thanks for coming on.
[00:35:56.208 --> 00:35:56.748]  Hey, Alex.
[00:35:56.828 --> 00:35:57.448]  Glad to be with you.
[00:35:58.568 --> 00:36:00.388]  Sir, you've got the floor.
[00:36:01.189 --> 00:36:05.609]  Can you, in layman's terms, break down what's happening during the break?
[00:36:05.689 --> 00:36:10.150]  I asked you, sir, normally when they cut interest rates or talk about it, that should hurt the dollar.
[00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:14.011]  But now the media, and I'm sure you've seen this, is saying, oh, this is good for the dollar.
[00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:17.352]  It's just everything is getting crazier and crazier.
[00:36:17.392 --> 00:36:17.932]  What's happening?
[00:36:19.647 --> 00:36:23.009]  I suspect just the disinformation and the ignorance.
[00:36:25.151 --> 00:36:42.883]  The problem as I see it right now is that our policy makers have us in an economic policy trap because the subprime mortgage meltdown requires low interest rates in order to contain the crisis.
[00:36:43.924 --> 00:36:45.545]  But the dollar's plight
[00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:47.012]  I think so.
[00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:16.291]  in the value of the dollar and neither do rents or return on equities.
[00:37:17.692 --> 00:37:35.455]  So it's sort of hard to expect people who already have huge dollar denominated portfolios to keep adding to those portfolios while the dollar is losing value.
[00:37:36.556 --> 00:37:40.298]  It was only a few years ago the Euro was worth 85 cents and today it's $1.48.
[00:37:40.499 --> 00:37:51.505]  Now that means an enormous decline in the holdings of foreigners who finance the US budget and trade deficits.
[00:37:52.686 --> 00:37:55.668]  A lot of people want to know how come they kept doing it.
[00:37:55.768 --> 00:38:04.834]  I think it's because they expected that at some point the United States would address the budget and trade deficits and get
[00:38:06.059 --> 00:38:20.012]  And also, I think, it's not a clear alternative as reserve currency to the dollar.
[00:38:21.834 --> 00:38:29.041]  But if you look at the performance rise in the value of the euro relative to the dollar,
[00:38:30.402 --> 00:38:37.245]  It shows you the great weakness of the dollar because the euro is really a currency without a country.
[00:38:38.285 --> 00:38:51.390]  The European Union doesn't really exist as a political entity because the component states have not turned over their national sovereignty.
[00:38:52.091 --> 00:38:58.173]  So France and Germany and Italy and the other members of the EU are still sovereign
[00:38:59.113 --> 00:39:00.154]  political entities.
[00:39:00.394 --> 00:39:04.956]  Britain, which is a member of the EU, still has its own currency.
[00:39:05.016 --> 00:39:07.457]  It's not even part of the euro.
[00:39:07.517 --> 00:39:25.246]  So, for a currency that has that many political vulnerabilities to rise so much against the world reserve currency, the dollar, it shows how desperate people are to diversify their holdings away
[00:39:27.388 --> 00:39:40.295]  Now, Dr. Roberts, there's been an acceleration by China, by Venezuela, by Saudi Arabia, even by Japan, by Europe, out of the dollar.
[00:39:40.475 --> 00:39:44.377]  They're trying to, in an orderly fashion, get out of it.
[00:39:45.417 --> 00:39:48.179]  In layman's terms, what are the breaks?
[00:39:48.259 --> 00:39:49.900]  I mean, what are the different things that could happen?
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.981]  I mean, what's on the good end of this and what's on the bad end of this?
[00:39:53.021 --> 00:39:54.362]  Where do you see this going?
[00:39:55.327 --> 00:40:02.049]  Well, first of all, let me say something about their efforts to accelerate getting out of the dollar.
[00:40:03.569 --> 00:40:12.592]  As far as I can tell, Alex, and I may be wrong, they're not getting out of the dollar, they're continuing to accumulate dollars.
[00:40:13.852 --> 00:40:20.034]  The great decline in the dollar results from them accumulating dollars at a slower rate.
[00:40:21.234 --> 00:40:23.735]  Instead of, say, taking on, for example,
[00:40:24.875 --> 00:40:28.756]  A hundred billion more dollars, they're only taking on 85 billion.
[00:40:30.256 --> 00:40:38.478]  And the fact that they're just reducing the rate at which they accumulate new dollars has caused the enormous decline in the dollar.
[00:40:38.598 --> 00:40:47.040]  If they were to stop altogether accumulating new dollars, I think the decline would be precipitous.
[00:40:48.681 --> 00:40:53.322]  If they were to dump parts of the existing holding,
[00:40:54.895 --> 00:40:56.756]  I mean, the dollar wouldn't be worth anything.
[00:40:56.896 --> 00:41:05.858]  Well, China did signal a month ago that they were going to divest in large portions of their, what, 1.3 trillion, or is that just saber-rattling?
[00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:22.283]  Well, I think what China, if I remember correctly what they did, they reminded the Secretary of the Treasury here that they were our largest banker and he needed to be more polite to them in public, because they do have that power.
[00:41:22.343 --> 00:41:23.924]  But I think what they're trying to do
[00:41:24.773 --> 00:41:33.417]  It's simply to stop, or certainly to cut back further, the rate at which they accumulate new dollars.
[00:41:33.498 --> 00:41:38.060]  Now, it's hard because we push out all these trade deficits.
[00:41:39.401 --> 00:41:53.708]  And if China ends up with, say, $200 billion because of the imports from China that exceed our exports to China, what are they going to do with it?
[00:41:54.287 --> 00:42:09.579]  And what generally they do is use that cash to acquire treasury bonds, American companies such as IBM's personal computer business, or real estate, or something like that.
[00:42:09.659 --> 00:42:16.364]  So the trade deficit basically sort of forces them to accumulate more dollars.
[00:42:16.424 --> 00:42:22.009]  Now if they say, well guys, we got another $200 billion out of them this year, we don't want that.
[00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:25.791]  How much of it can we diversify?
[00:42:25.811 --> 00:42:27.252]  They probably have a hard time.
[00:42:27.612 --> 00:42:29.292]  Where would they find $100 billion?
[00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:50.221]  That's what you talked about, is there's so many dollars, even if they want to dump them, there's nowhere to dump even a fraction of it, and here we are selling out our sovereignty and infrastructure for CD players and video games and baubles and cameras, and meanwhile these foreign countries are getting water supplies, roads, the actual factories.
[00:42:50.721 --> 00:42:51.822]  Here's my question to you, sir.
[00:42:54.895 --> 00:43:00.657]  Long term, I mean by long term I don't mean the next 365 days, the way things are moving that seems long term.
[00:43:02.758 --> 00:43:14.202]  What policy move do you see, or with the different policy statements we're seeing by Europe, by Asia, and then by the US, just bottom line, if you had to have a guesstimation, where do you see all this going?
[00:43:14.222 --> 00:43:15.403]  And expanding on that question,
[00:43:16.667 --> 00:43:21.370]  I'm no financial expert, but I talk to all the big experts and read what they have to say.
[00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:24.612]  And on the good end, they're saying serious sustained recession.
[00:43:24.912 --> 00:43:27.874]  On the bad end, they're saying global financial meltdown.
[00:43:27.954 --> 00:43:39.282]  We have all these different cases where they're talking about not just the housing debt unraveling early next year, being much worse than it is right now, and the subprime crisis.
[00:43:39.722 --> 00:43:40.623]  Well, I think there are a lot of
[00:44:05.635 --> 00:44:30.809]  Potential things that can spin out of control, but it seems to me the most dangerous is the dollar losing more of its role as a reserve currency or even being dropped as a reserve currency because when the dollar is no longer a reserve currency we can no longer finance our trade deficit or our budget deficit.
[00:44:30.869 --> 00:44:33.711]  So the government couldn't finance its operations
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.002]  Because we rely entirely on foreigners to finance these things.
[00:44:38.022 --> 00:44:42.564]  Their saving rate here in the United States is zero.
[00:44:42.624 --> 00:44:43.224]  It's negative.
[00:44:43.804 --> 00:44:44.945]  Negative, practically.
[00:44:45.025 --> 00:45:03.253]  So if the dollar loses more of its reserve currency role, and people are unwilling to continue accumulating them at the current rates, and then
[00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:15.955]  This forces down the dollar's value more, which makes them even less willing to accumulate, and it becomes a vicious cycle down.
[00:45:16.055 --> 00:45:30.522]  And the only thing that can possibly stop that cycle would be a big hike in interest rates to say, look, you can get so much here on treasury bonds that it pays you
[00:45:31.573 --> 00:45:32.754]  We're good to go.
[00:45:51.744 --> 00:45:52.585]  You see what I'm saying?
[00:45:52.645 --> 00:45:58.771]  Well, in my recent article I actually say it's possible we've crossed the point of no return that we can't resolve the crisis because
[00:46:17.695 --> 00:46:23.257]  One requires low interest rates, and the other requires high interest rates, and either one of them can do us in.
[00:46:23.517 --> 00:46:25.538]  And so, I don't know.
[00:46:26.318 --> 00:46:42.804]  I think all that could happen, all that could happen would be for Washington to show that it was taking decisive actions to curtail government spending, to stop the dependence on foreign borrowing to finance the government.
[00:46:42.864 --> 00:46:46.865]  That would mean, of course, ending all the wars, which are so expensive.
[00:46:47.817 --> 00:47:01.426]  And simultaneously acknowledging that the offshoring of American jobs is the main contributor to the trade deficit.
[00:47:01.726 --> 00:47:05.368]  Because every time a company offshores production for U.S.
[00:47:05.428 --> 00:47:12.093]  markets, it turns a gross domestic product into imports.
[00:47:13.013 --> 00:47:17.016]  So you can never stop the trade deficit as long as you permit all this
[00:47:17.891 --> 00:47:18.732]  Uh, offshoring.
[00:47:19.032 --> 00:47:20.954]  Because as you've said, we're not trading.
[00:47:20.994 --> 00:47:22.956]  Those companies have actually just moved there.
[00:47:22.976 --> 00:47:23.677]  No, they're not trading.
[00:47:23.717 --> 00:47:26.680]  They're just moving in order to get cheaper labor.
[00:47:27.441 --> 00:47:38.372]  So, in other words, if you have a plant in Illinois and it's making goods that you're selling to Americans, and then you move that to China, then that
[00:47:39.318 --> 00:47:42.899]  Output disappears from the domestic national income.
[00:47:42.999 --> 00:47:44.320]  We're talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:44.980]  Dr. Roberts.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:47.861]  It becomes an import from China, which raises the trade deficit.
[00:47:48.381 --> 00:47:51.442]  Dr. Roberts, then here's a $65 million question.
[00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:56.003]  What do you see from their statements versus their real actions?
[00:47:56.423 --> 00:48:01.305]  What does it appear the policy is of the people steering our system?
[00:48:03.365 --> 00:48:08.227]  Well, I think that what the policy has been of the people steering the system
[00:48:09.297 --> 00:48:13.501]  is to make the Middle East safe for Israeli territorial expansion.
[00:48:14.461 --> 00:48:18.564]  That's why we have these enormous costly wars.
[00:48:19.885 --> 00:48:33.456]  I see beginning yesterday, I think, that finally the permanent government in Washington is moving to rein in the morons in the Bush administration.
[00:48:34.036 --> 00:48:34.777]  We saw the
[00:48:35.495 --> 00:48:48.641]  The release of the intelligence reports that conclude that Iran ceased all work on nuclear weapons in 2003, I think it was, which was, you know, three or four years ago.
[00:48:49.221 --> 00:48:56.664]  So, that has undercut the neoconservative Israeli push for an attack on Iran.
[00:48:58.385 --> 00:49:03.887]  So, it may well be the permanent government is now going to see if it can
[00:49:04.671 --> 00:49:15.877]  Rain in and impose some sanity on the political administration, the elected political administration in Washington.
[00:49:15.957 --> 00:49:18.238]  And by permanent government, you mean the bureaucracy?
[00:49:18.639 --> 00:49:19.819]  Yeah, the bureaucracy.
[00:49:19.839 --> 00:49:30.525]  The hated bureaucracy, the things that we've always despised and demonized, in the end may be what saves us from the fools we elect.
[00:49:32.045 --> 00:49:45.769]  But anyhow, you have to admit that it's very reassuring to see the intelligence community state unequivocally that all work ceased on Iranian nuclear weapons some years ago.
[00:49:45.909 --> 00:49:47.089]  And even the State Department.
[00:49:47.249 --> 00:49:49.170]  That shows splits inside the White House.
[00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:54.411]  Perhaps.
[00:49:55.651 --> 00:50:01.473]  So, I think much of the dollar's trouble, at least some of it, is
[00:50:02.082 --> 00:50:08.467]  People were expecting, on top of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, there was going to be one in Iran!
[00:50:09.628 --> 00:50:15.293]  And who, you know, demanding ever greater financing of the U.S.
[00:50:15.333 --> 00:50:15.713]  government.
[00:50:17.115 --> 00:50:26.322]  So, I think just that one intelligence report has helped a little bit.
[00:50:26.763 --> 00:50:28.324]  And other things like that
[00:50:28.988 --> 00:50:30.989]  It is a big idea.
[00:50:57.745 --> 00:50:58.785]  A New World Order!
[00:50:59.526 --> 00:51:03.787]  In the near future, birth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:04.427 --> 00:51:06.548]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:07.028 --> 00:51:09.489]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:51:10.029 --> 00:51:12.450]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:20.553]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:28.550]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:29.011 --> 00:51:32.493]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:32.873 --> 00:51:35.395]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[00:51:35.435 --> 00:51:36.596]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:36.616 --> 00:51:37.376]  They're not after money.
[00:51:37.396 --> 00:51:38.457]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:38.677 --> 00:51:39.418]  They're after power.
[00:51:39.658 --> 00:51:40.779]  That's what they're after usually.

[00:51:52.086 --> 00:51:53.527]  You have been warned.
[00:51:54.187 --> 00:51:57.209]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:51:57.529 --> 00:52:02.452]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:02.692 --> 00:52:07.055]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:07.355 --> 00:52:16.260]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:20.082]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:20.362 --> 00:52:25.408]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:25.689 --> 00:52:32.397]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:32.921 --> 00:52:33.562]  What about you?

[00:52:54.318 --> 00:52:57.641]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[00:52:57.981 --> 00:53:04.888]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:53:05.268 --> 00:53:17.759]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.642]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[00:53:20.982 --> 00:53:27.166]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[00:53:27.406 --> 00:53:32.549]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[00:53:32.789 --> 00:53:41.053]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[00:53:41.253 --> 00:53:41.894]  And the best part?
[00:53:42.134 --> 00:53:44.135]  My listeners pay absolutely nothing today.
[00:53:44.375 --> 00:53:46.957]  Simply go to 321release.com or call 815-259-4552 for details.
[00:53:46.977 --> 00:53:50.800]  I have to say that in the 20, 30 interviews we've done out at Roberts over the last few years,
[00:54:13.892 --> 00:54:16.433]  This is one of the first times I've heard him be positive.
[00:54:16.813 --> 00:54:18.474]  And it's always darkest before the dawn.
[00:54:20.815 --> 00:54:25.757]  We were talking during the break, sir, and you were saying America, Israel's name, superpower status is basically finished.
[00:54:26.417 --> 00:54:35.740]  What about the permanent government police state that you know goes back before even this current guy back to Clinton and before that with the military-industrial complex?
[00:54:36.341 --> 00:54:37.741]  I mean, what do you see us being now?
[00:54:37.801 --> 00:54:38.241]  Just a third-rate
[00:54:41.104 --> 00:54:48.365]  Kind of like Russia falling apart, with still corrupt elites and robber barons kind of feeding on us, because I see no sign of that letting up.
[00:54:48.965 --> 00:54:51.866]  Yes, all that will continue for a while.
[00:54:54.026 --> 00:55:04.828]  It's not clear what the Supreme Court is going to do to overthrow the police state that the Bush Nazis have put into place.
[00:55:05.949 --> 00:55:08.509]  It may well be the Supreme Court will overthrow it.
[00:55:09.338 --> 00:55:12.680]  And that we will get rid of it.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:15.742]  That's not an impossibility.
[00:55:15.782 --> 00:55:26.107]  We've seen such resistance in the military itself, among officers, to the military tribunals that they're trying to use in Guantanamo.
[00:55:27.648 --> 00:55:34.152]  So they don't yet have an ideological following to the extent that, say, Hitler had.
[00:55:34.864 --> 00:55:38.467]  So that they can run roughshod over everything.
[00:55:38.527 --> 00:55:45.972]  So the courts might stand and they may overturn this plea state stuff.
[00:55:46.152 --> 00:55:55.139]  So I haven't given up all hope on that because I think Bush and Cheney are so weakened and discredited and despised over the world.
[00:55:56.013 --> 00:55:59.296]  I doubt either one of them will be able to do any foreign travel.
[00:55:59.476 --> 00:56:02.958]  But they show they have incredible chutzpah and aplomb.
[00:56:03.599 --> 00:56:05.560]  What about the ace in the hole, a staged event?
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.362]  All the Republican memos say they need one.
[00:56:08.563 --> 00:56:08.803]  Right.
[00:56:10.184 --> 00:56:13.987]  But you see, who are they going to blame it on this time?
[00:56:14.007 --> 00:56:15.648]  Well, they played that card too much, haven't they?
[00:56:15.688 --> 00:56:16.749]  Yeah.
[00:56:16.989 --> 00:56:25.756]  I think it's difficult now to stage that, particularly because, you know, what we were talking about earlier, they lack the financial power.
[00:56:26.963 --> 00:56:28.424]  I don't know.
[00:56:43.618 --> 00:56:45.959]  I think that we've lost our economy because we've permitted so much
[00:57:11.466 --> 00:57:21.230]  Deindustrialization, so much loss of middle class, upper middle class, professional jobs, you know, information technology, software engineers.
[00:57:21.911 --> 00:57:25.753]  There's so much that's been lost, it's going to be hard to get it back.
[00:57:27.033 --> 00:57:37.198]  And I don't know that the rest of the world will let us get it back because we're no longer a superpower.
[00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:47.264]  We've wasted our position and our resources, and so... Well, two years ago, you talked about we used to be soft power.
[00:57:47.304 --> 00:57:48.825]  Now we hear about gates and others.
[00:57:48.845 --> 00:57:50.445]  They're all... That's the new word.
[00:57:50.725 --> 00:57:52.506]  But once you've already blown it, you don't have it.
[00:57:52.866 --> 00:57:53.306]  That's right.
[00:57:53.426 --> 00:57:53.966]  We've blown it.
[00:57:55.366 --> 00:58:08.130]  If you just look how Putin speaks about us, or Chavez speaks about us, or anybody speaks about us, they don't have the respect and awe
[00:58:09.625 --> 00:58:10.146]  It's gone.
[00:58:11.527 --> 00:58:16.010]  So, they now see us as, you know, an emperor without any clothes.
[00:58:18.352 --> 00:58:21.154]  We can't even occupy Baghdad after five years.
[00:58:21.614 --> 00:58:24.056]  And they know that 9-11's an inside job.
[00:58:24.116 --> 00:58:25.938]  Dr. Roberts, amazing interview.
[00:58:26.258 --> 00:58:28.479]  Thank you so much for your work for this republic.
[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:29.820]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:58:30.181 --> 00:58:30.741]  God bless you.
[00:58:31.061 --> 00:58:32.603]  We'll be right back with Michael Rivera.
[00:58:32.623 --> 00:58:33.403]  You are listening to GPN.
[00:58:39.873 --> 00:58:42.156]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.947 --> 00:58:51.607]  Big Brother.
[00:58:52.248 --> 00:58:53.410]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:55.152]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:55.773 --> 00:58:56.594]  You want answers?
[00:58:57.322 --> 00:58:58.203]  Well, so does he.
[00:58:58.243 --> 00:59:02.746]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:03.086 --> 00:59:07.189]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:10.372]  The New World Order is down, but they're not out.
[00:59:10.412 --> 00:59:15.195]  They, I guarantee you, have got the ace card in their hand thinking about playing it.
[00:59:15.235 --> 00:59:17.117]  It'll be their undoing if they do it, but they're arrogant.
[00:59:17.557 --> 00:59:26.404]  That stage terror attacks to get us into World War III, they think that'll boost the Anglo-American slash Israeli crime arm to the next level.
[00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:29.872]  But there's such disdain globally.
[00:59:29.892 --> 00:59:35.697]  But listen, folks, I read 15 years ago, stuff from 30, 40 years ago, about how they were going to build the U.S.
[00:59:35.858 --> 00:59:45.887]  up, blow out the dollar, demonize us for globalist expansion, while the banks actually get all those holdings, and then we have to fall before the new old order can rise.
[00:59:46.388 --> 00:59:51.753]  And so basically, we were kind of like a war wagon they just ran the gas out of, blew the pistons out of.
[00:59:52.273 --> 00:59:52.713]  We're good to go.
[01:00:13.487 --> 01:00:30.452]  And then when you figure out that we were used as the Ponzi scheme to build up the bubble, and that tsunami of 1,500 trillion addition derivatives that the central banks used, that they're going to blame on us, they use that tsunami of cash to buy up the world!
[01:00:31.272 --> 01:00:56.922]  So now private interest, in this banking hegemony, they are now buying up the last vestiges of free market cutlets that are left on the global risk board, and now they're going in to a Eurocentric, with China and Russia orbiting it, into the future.
[01:00:56.942 --> 01:01:00.624]  It will be an overrun third world country, slave wages,
[01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:03.649]  Just absolutely horrible.
[01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:11.971]  Now, such wealth was secreted here through the bubble itself that that's my only hope.
[01:01:12.512 --> 01:01:18.734]  And there's still some trained individuals and some people that aren't lazy and stupid in this country.
[01:01:18.774 --> 01:01:20.814]  But, I mean, you just heard the father of Reaganomics.
[01:01:21.255 --> 01:01:27.437]  By every major economics firm out there, every big publication, he's in the top ten living economists.
[01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:31.859]  And you just heard him tell you what's going on.
[01:01:32.799 --> 01:01:41.564]  And it just makes me so mad that all these fake Republicans who supported Bush and the neocons thinking it was for America.
[01:01:41.704 --> 01:01:44.945]  Because I hear them calling talk shows and go, yeah, it's about oil and our empire.
[01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:48.147]  Let's just kill all them A-rabbers and get their money.
[01:01:48.507 --> 01:01:49.367]  You idiots!
[01:01:49.868 --> 01:01:55.590]  We were used to go steal it, then it's handed over to the big European banks, and we get left with all the blame!
[01:01:57.071 --> 01:01:59.092]  Now, I gave a speech right before Ron Paul,
[01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:09.372]  What, in 2002, put it in Matrix of Evil, 2002, where I explained all this.
[01:02:09.812 --> 01:02:19.074]  I said, we're going to go into Iraq, we're going to be there, they're going to break it in three parts, they're going to destroy the dollar, they're going to then use the U.S.
[01:02:19.134 --> 01:02:27.476]  to, I gave the analogy of there's a lot of different species of insect that will lay eggs in beetles or other larger insects, and then the babies
[01:02:28.207 --> 01:02:28.588]  No, I don't.
[01:02:34.705 --> 01:02:41.508]  The next phase you'll bust out of the beetle and basically we've just had all our insides eaten out.
[01:02:42.028 --> 01:02:53.474]  While the New World Order projected propaganda into our minds and our culture going, we're the good guys, we're fighting Al-Qaeda, we're good, oh yeah boy, everything's nice, everything's wonderful, we're the good people.
[01:02:53.494 --> 01:02:58.096]  Meanwhile we're being eaten out from the inside by the very people that ran the attacks.
[01:02:59.241 --> 01:03:09.083]  And so just remember, when you're totally broke, totally shot, don't have a pot to you-know-what in, you just remember the New World Order did it to you.
[01:03:09.483 --> 01:03:09.923]  Okay?
[01:03:11.003 --> 01:03:12.044]  You just remember that.
[01:03:12.084 --> 01:03:18.445]  You remember who did it to you, you remember how you suckered along with it, and remember how you laughed at us and everything else you did.
[01:03:20.746 --> 01:03:24.586]  We tried as hard as we could, and we still might be able to save this country.
[01:03:25.126 --> 01:03:27.567]  But, I mean, it's a diminishing chance.
[01:03:28.527 --> 01:03:35.329]  But at least having it fall apart like the Soviet Union is better than World War III and giant death camps.
[01:03:35.409 --> 01:03:37.470]  And that's what they want to set up, and they still may do it.
[01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:44.712]  I mean, when Gary Hart's writing letters to the Iranians saying, you better back off, we staged terror attacks, they're not in the open now.
[01:03:46.873 --> 01:03:48.273]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:48.293 --> 01:03:50.374]  A new world order.
[01:03:51.114 --> 01:03:55.935]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:03:55.995 --> 01:03:58.236]  It's known as the Bilderberg Theory.
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.064]  So their objective be world domination?
[01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:04.048]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:12.161]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:15.122 --> 01:04:20.105]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:20.625 --> 01:04:24.067]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:24.447 --> 01:04:26.968]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:27.008 --> 01:04:28.169]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:28.189 --> 01:04:28.929]  They're not after money.
[01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:30.030]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:31.010]  They're after power.
[01:04:31.231 --> 01:04:32.351]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:05:46.403 --> 01:05:48.825]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:52.647]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:05:53.027 --> 01:05:55.949]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:05:56.249 --> 01:06:02.633]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:06:02.693 --> 01:06:07.116]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:06:07.336 --> 01:06:11.718]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:06:11.859 --> 01:06:14.460]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.241]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:06:17.722 --> 01:06:20.263]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:06:20.303 --> 01:06:24.545]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:06:24.605 --> 01:06:25.446]  Treasury bonds.
[01:06:25.726 --> 01:06:30.368]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.169]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:32.189 --> 01:06:34.590]  That's 1-888-XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:38.973]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:54.671 --> 01:07:04.219]  Michael Rivera is here from whatreallyhappened.com to talk about this new national security assessment put out by the CIA.
[01:07:04.239 --> 01:07:06.461]  The State Department is saying they're not going to war with Iran.
[01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:09.803]  We're going to be discussing that with him.
[01:07:09.883 --> 01:07:17.389]  Also, the former Italian President, the longest serving President since Mussolini, very highly respected.
[01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:20.772]  He's gone public saying 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:07:21.867 --> 01:07:24.449]  So we'll be talking with Michael Rivero about that, also coming up in about 30 minutes.
[01:07:24.489 --> 01:07:26.149]  He's going to be with us in the next hour or two.
[01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:29.651]  We're going to open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:34.574]  We'll talk about the economy, Ron Paul, are they going to go to war with Iran?
[01:07:34.874 --> 01:07:36.455]  Are they going to stage some type of black op?
[01:07:37.016 --> 01:07:40.117]  What will America look like if this whole system starts falling apart?
[01:07:40.137 --> 01:07:42.258]  You know, the new world order doesn't have to be foretold.
[01:07:42.298 --> 01:07:43.199]  It doesn't have to happen.
[01:07:43.974 --> 01:07:46.236]  I know the preachers tell you that, and it may come in the future.
[01:07:46.256 --> 01:07:47.536]  I'm sure it will happen in the future.
[01:07:47.556 --> 01:07:48.777]  There's always bad stuff.
[01:07:49.118 --> 01:07:55.122]  I believe the Bible, but we can get a reprieve like Nineveh is my point, and boy, I'll take it if I can get it.
[01:07:55.142 --> 01:07:57.583]  Now, I'm not trying to be overly positive here.
[01:07:57.603 --> 01:08:07.630]  I am putting perfume on a pig, but a few of the things that are happening right now does show a major shift in a backing off of the more slow New World Order social engineering, but long term, that may be worse for us.
[01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:15.772]  Because, you know, the big ham-fisted, wild-eyed mode they've been in the last decade or so has really woken a lot of people up.
[01:08:17.333 --> 01:08:21.174]  Let me go on back to Michael Rivero, introducing him here in just a moment.
[01:08:22.314 --> 01:08:25.415]  Before I do that, we have really a fabulous sponsor.
[01:08:26.216 --> 01:08:37.399]  And with all of the things that are going on in the country, with all of the uncertainty that is taking place,
[01:08:38.348 --> 01:08:38.648]  I think so.
[01:08:38.688 --> 01:08:39.108]  I think so.
[01:09:05.509 --> 01:09:06.070]  I think so.
[01:09:22.618 --> 01:09:23.938]  Now they've just got so much more.
[01:09:23.958 --> 01:09:26.199]  ENERFOOD.COM or give them a call at 866-762-9238.
[01:09:26.219 --> 01:09:27.019]  ENERFOOD.COM.
[01:09:27.059 --> 01:09:28.499]  And their new Coco Mojo is a great holiday addition.
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:29.400]  Great Coco.
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:30.560]  Alright, going to Michael DeVero.
[01:09:44.273 --> 01:09:54.704]  Mike, let's get in first to the National Intelligence Assessment, then the former Italian President saying 9-11 is an inside job in Italy's biggest newspaper.
[01:09:56.466 --> 01:10:05.576]  Well, obviously the National Intelligence Estimate, you know, is a major, major story and this appears to be the same NIE that was being talked about almost a year ago
[01:10:06.204 --> 01:10:09.786]  Where it was being held up because pressure from Dick Cheney in the White House.
[01:10:10.986 --> 01:10:15.048]  What they were trying to do is say, we can't release these results until everybody agrees on it.
[01:10:15.088 --> 01:10:17.729]  Because there were about 15 different agencies involved in this.
[01:10:18.249 --> 01:10:22.451]  And there were some differences over some of the minor points.
[01:10:22.531 --> 01:10:30.454]  Yeah, they have a Pentagon office that Rumsfeld set up that cooks intelligence, claiming that they had co-equal with the CIA analyst.
[01:10:31.435 --> 01:10:32.495]  Yeah, very much so.
[01:10:32.555 --> 01:10:34.476]  And they were basically stalling the whole thing.
[01:10:35.124 --> 01:10:37.125]  But obviously this is the same N.I.E.
[01:10:37.205 --> 01:10:41.867]  and it was released, I believe, actually in October, but without the conclusions.
[01:10:42.367 --> 01:10:52.771]  So it briefly surfaced then, but apparently now somebody has gone ahead and released it with the conclusions that Iran did in fact stop its weapons program back in 2003.
[01:10:54.031 --> 01:10:59.693]  And what's amazing is looking at the way the media is covering it, because yesterday it was on the U.S.
[01:10:59.773 --> 01:11:04.215]  media, but this morning I got up, I put on BBC, we're able to pick that up off the satellite,
[01:11:04.614 --> 01:11:13.781]  And they're running the story all over the place, and they're showing the videotapes of George Bush and Dick Cheney just from two months ago, screaming that Iran was on the verge of having a bomb.
[01:11:14.501 --> 01:11:26.931]  And, you know, and then showing this report that says that Cheney and Bush knew that Iran had quit their weapons program in 2003, and it's just pounding on the fact that they have lied about this.
[01:11:26.971 --> 01:11:32.675]  So I switched over to CNN, and they're showing Miss Puerto Rico may have lied about the pepper spray attack.
[01:11:33.411 --> 01:11:43.478]  And to me, this basically says the mainstream media, once again, is going to act as Bush's shield and enabler as they try and sweep this under the rug.
[01:11:43.838 --> 01:11:53.244]  But, you know, I used to comment that Iraq was the first war in history in which the lies that started it were exposed while the war was being fought.
[01:11:53.324 --> 01:12:01.089]  Well, that's been superseded because now we have the lie that's being used to start the war in Iran is exposed before the war even starts.
[01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:08.035]  And what is really frightening is that it looks like Bush and the neocons are still going to try and move forward with this war.
[01:12:08.818 --> 01:12:13.903]  Even though their primary reason for it has just exploded in their faces.
[01:12:14.003 --> 01:12:14.463]  That's right.
[01:12:14.524 --> 01:12:18.187]  Bush is back out today saying, hey, it's still on with Iran.
[01:12:18.527 --> 01:12:20.169]  They still got nukes and want to kill us.
[01:12:20.189 --> 01:12:21.170]  They're trying to get nukes.
[01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:22.531]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:12:22.891 --> 01:12:24.733]  And this is something clear here.
[01:12:24.813 --> 01:12:26.855]  You have the soft power UN New World Order.
[01:12:27.315 --> 01:12:30.138]  You have Bush taking the place of the quote right wing New World Order.
[01:12:30.498 --> 01:12:34.302]  As I told you six, seven years ago, they're giving you a false paradigm of false choices.
[01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:37.418]  Either way, Iran is dominated by the globalists.
[01:12:37.438 --> 01:12:44.321]  The UN's in there, they let them inspect everything to a level the IAEA said no one had ever allowed them to that level.
[01:12:44.401 --> 01:12:47.143]  Total red carpet, anywhere they wanted to go, anytime.
[01:12:47.543 --> 01:12:49.624]  Our government doesn't let them do that, and by the way, they shouldn't.
[01:12:50.224 --> 01:12:54.546]  And so, either way, this is bad, because the UN now is the authority.
[01:12:54.886 --> 01:12:56.647]  This is setting them up as the good guy.
[01:12:57.067 --> 01:13:00.909]  And then either way, Iran can't have its own sovereignty, and that sets that precedent.
[01:13:02.176 --> 01:13:03.498]  Well, the problem is that the U.N.
[01:13:03.558 --> 01:13:09.727]  is never going to have credibility unless they're able to go into Israel and examine their nuclear weapons and their weapons program.
[01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:15.155]  Up until then, that hypocrisy is going to undermine any U.N.
[01:13:15.236 --> 01:13:17.799]  pretensions to global order or global policemen.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:27.326]  Uh, you know, they're shooting themselves in their own foot, you know, by their inability to deal with the one real nuclear power in the Middle East, which is, of course, you know, Israel.
[01:13:27.627 --> 01:13:33.631]  And all this talk about Iraq and Iran wanting nuclear weapons, they're not starting an arms race, they're trying to join one that's been going on
[01:13:34.051 --> 01:13:38.735]  Since the 60s, according to those documents that were just released from the Nixon Library.
[01:13:38.775 --> 01:13:40.297]  Hey, let me ask you a question, Mike.
[01:13:40.597 --> 01:13:44.560]  What's your take, shifting gears here, to Central Asia?
[01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:55.369]  Why did Britain, France, and the US, and this is all admitted, knowingly transfer all the nuclear weapons systems and medium range delivery systems to AQ Khan Laboratories in the mid-90s through 2001?
[01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:58.272]  Why did they build up Pakistan?
[01:14:00.916 --> 01:14:13.622]  I think they were building up Pakistan, because at the time, I think they were thinking it would be a replacement for Turkey, because if you remember, we used to have all these missiles, nuclear missiles in Turkey, that we had to pull out following the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:14:13.642 --> 01:14:26.848]  So a base in the belly of Russia, well that's, I agree with that also, to kind of ratchet up the crises between Pakistan and India, who has the nukes, they see that as a set piece or balancing move, but if you really analyze it, and most analysts agree, it was insane to arm them.
[01:14:28.055 --> 01:14:30.017]  It absolutely was, but you know, most U.S.
[01:14:30.057 --> 01:14:38.844]  foreign policy is being handled by people who know they've only got the job for four or six years, and they really don't think about the consequences past that point.
[01:14:39.245 --> 01:14:41.367]  And if you go back through the entire history of U.S.
[01:14:41.407 --> 01:14:52.636]  foreign interventionalism, whether we go into Chile and kick out Allende and put in Pinochet, it solved an immediate need, but nobody was thinking what's going to happen, you know, 10, 20 years down the road.
[01:14:52.696 --> 01:14:54.578]  The same thing when we put the Shah of Iran.
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.881]  into power and propped him up.
[01:14:57.101 --> 01:15:04.443]  Nobody was thinking years down the road when the Iranian people got so angry with America that they put Ayatollah Khomeini in power and start seizing the embassies.
[01:15:04.743 --> 01:15:08.384]  The same thing in the Philippines with Marcos, just over and over again.
[01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:24.368]  Well, it also discredits them whenever... it also discredits them whenever they're talking about, we've got to attack Iran right now, they're eight years from a nuke and we left them alone, but meanwhile Pakistan's completely destabilized with a bunch of nuts running around waving machine guns and they've got nukes.
[01:15:25.486 --> 01:15:32.571]  Which they absolutely do, and the bottom line is that, unfortunately, in the modern era, nuclear weapons have become very easy to come by.
[01:15:33.212 --> 01:15:35.794]  You can go out... I mean, even I know how to build an atomic bomb.
[01:15:36.174 --> 01:15:39.376]  You know, I mean, that's... The knowledge is out there.
[01:15:39.416 --> 01:15:42.579]  This idea that if we leave them alone, they'll figure it out.
[01:15:42.679 --> 01:15:43.459]  They already know.
[01:15:43.679 --> 01:15:45.561]  Everybody already knows how to build a bomb.
[01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:50.745]  If you can get the fissionables, you know, then you can rock and roll on the thing.
[01:15:51.045 --> 01:15:54.007]  Fissionables have become a black... Yeah, it's become a black market.
[01:15:54.830 --> 01:16:04.467]  Again, going back to those Nixon papers that were just released, Israel built their first nuclear bombs with plutonium and uranium they stole from the United States.
[01:16:05.371 --> 01:16:18.516]  And I remember back then, when it was briefly in the news, there was a big material unaccounted for from the Savannah River plant, and then the next day they said, oh, it's probably just caked and plated inside the piping of the system, so we're not going to worry about it.
[01:16:18.536 --> 01:16:20.617]  By the way, do you know who guards all U.S.
[01:16:20.637 --> 01:16:21.357]  military bases?
[01:16:21.417 --> 01:16:24.238]  It's a private Israeli company that guards all the nuke bases.
[01:16:25.179 --> 01:16:29.700]  Yeah, and you know, that makes it very easy for them to basically get this material out.
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:33.042]  You had a private Israeli company doing security on all the 9-11 airports.
[01:16:35.931 --> 01:16:36.571]  Oh, man.
[01:16:37.291 --> 01:16:37.632]  Yeah.
[01:16:37.652 --> 01:16:40.092]  Hey, what do you think makes Israel tick?
[01:16:40.112 --> 01:16:42.693]  I mean, they just really want World War III.
[01:16:44.273 --> 01:16:49.675]  What they want is for everybody else to destroy themselves so that Israel will be in charge of whatever's left.
[01:16:49.735 --> 01:16:57.197]  And I've been saying on my website for a long time that I really think that the ultimate goal that Israel has in mind is for the U.S.
[01:16:57.237 --> 01:17:05.119]  and Russia to seriously weaken each other in a mutually destructive war, which would leave Israel and its nuclear arsenal basically in charge of
[01:17:05.569 --> 01:17:08.470]  What's left of the world's easily reachable oil in the Mideast.
[01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:20.592]  And, you know, we've certainly seen Israel continuing to push and push and push, and, you know, once Russia kicked out the oligarchs, all of a sudden Russia became the bad guy again.
[01:17:20.992 --> 01:17:34.214]  And they're getting a lot of support from the military, who would love to see the Cold War come back, because it was an excuse to soak the American taxpayer for trillions of dollars to build a bunch of silos and subs and rockets and nuclear warheads, none of which ever
[01:17:34.798 --> 01:17:40.439]  Thankfully, we're used, but by the same token, they didn't, you know, we don't even know if they ever would have even worked.
[01:17:40.459 --> 01:17:41.979]  It was just a huge scam.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:50.661]  And, you know, I remember the old duck and cover movies we were shown in school, you know, where... That's just like the anti-terror drills now.
[01:17:50.701 --> 01:17:51.701]  The condition is in the fear.
[01:17:52.702 --> 01:17:53.702]  Yeah, very much so.
[01:17:53.742 --> 01:18:02.264]  You look back at those birth-to-turtle movies and this idea that you could save yourself by pulling a picnic cloth over your head when the flash happened was just utterly absurd.
[01:18:02.384 --> 01:18:04.624]  And these films weren't really about saving lives.
[01:18:05.026 --> 01:18:12.170]  It was just to keep people afraid and convince them that it was okay to be building these nuclear weapons because we could survive a nuclear war.
[01:18:12.690 --> 01:18:15.912]  And it was just absurd stuff, and it's more lies.
[01:18:16.412 --> 01:18:32.781]  And now the American people, because of alternative radios such as your shows, because of websites like ours, PrisonPlanet.com, AlexJones.com, WhatReallyHappened.com, the American people have finally woken up to the fact that we are ruled by a government that lies to us every single day of our lives.
[01:18:33.297 --> 01:18:35.298]  To trick us into going along with their agenda.
[01:18:35.538 --> 01:18:36.558]  Michael Rivero, stay there.
[01:18:36.578 --> 01:18:38.419]  I want to talk about their game plan.
[01:18:38.459 --> 01:18:43.521]  What's the New World are going to do now that their Anglo-American arm is stalling in the mud?
[01:18:43.541 --> 01:18:44.521]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:47.042 --> 01:18:48.763]  Ted Anders from Midas, December 4th, 2007.
[01:18:48.983 --> 01:18:51.944]  Gold 800 ounce gold coins be purchased for 824.16, 406.20 per half, 203.10 per quarter.
[01:18:51.984 --> 01:18:52.244]  That's 824.16, 406.20, 203.10.
[01:19:00.316 --> 01:19:06.422]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[01:19:06.482 --> 01:19:10.886]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan Revolution.
[01:19:11.206 --> 01:19:19.854]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[01:19:19.894 --> 01:19:22.517]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[01:19:22.817 --> 01:19:26.779]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[01:19:26.999 --> 01:19:33.522]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[01:19:33.862 --> 01:19:35.043]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:19:35.243 --> 01:19:40.745]  The value of your hard earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[01:19:40.845 --> 01:19:41.106]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:41.126 --> 01:19:41.306]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:46.708 --> 01:19:47.348]  It's a fact.
[01:19:47.589 --> 01:19:55.053]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:19:55.173 --> 01:20:04.037]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:20:04.317 --> 01:20:14.863]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:20:15.123 --> 01:20:21.187]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:20:21.387 --> 01:20:26.411]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:20:26.611 --> 01:20:31.094]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:20:31.254 --> 01:20:33.055]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:20:33.075 --> 01:20:33.276]  That's 877-943-8600.
[01:20:33.296 --> 01:20:33.656]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:20:33.696 --> 01:20:35.277]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:20:44.503 --> 01:20:48.946]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:20:49.086 --> 01:20:55.790]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:20:56.050 --> 01:21:04.215]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:21:04.435 --> 01:21:10.179]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:21:10.339 --> 01:21:12.120]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:14.341]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:21:14.481 --> 01:21:18.723]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:21:18.903 --> 01:21:21.044]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:21:21.124 --> 01:21:28.868]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:21:28.988 --> 01:21:29.789]  We're good to go.
[01:21:46.787 --> 01:21:50.131]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN Financial Bulletin.
[01:21:50.431 --> 01:21:55.436]  Have you ever wanted to make a lot of extra cash in a way that requires very little money to get started?
[01:21:55.836 --> 01:22:01.002]  If so, and you have a high-speed internet connection, this may well be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:22:01.222 --> 01:22:01.803]  Here's why.
[01:22:02.003 --> 01:22:09.991]  You can now get a free DVD that reveals how to make more money than any sane person can possibly spend, and do it while working part-time at home.
[01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:10.551]  I think so.
[01:22:29.994 --> 01:22:30.335]  I'm good.
[01:23:00.926 --> 01:23:13.654]  Mike Rivero, last hour I had Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on, and he's writing articles like The Lies at the End of the American Dream, The Impending Destruction of the U.S.
[01:23:13.715 --> 01:23:26.643]  Economy, you know, he's the father of Reaganomics, ran the show under Reagan, and he's saying we'll fall apart like the Soviet Union, just as you've always been saying, but there are these larger global financial interests,
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:28.120]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:54.783]  So, obviously, we have these corrupt global interests that are trying to set up this whole global system.
[01:23:55.103 --> 01:23:59.844]  They've been setting the police state up for 50 years, really, in the last 20, a crescendo.
[01:24:00.485 --> 01:24:03.186]  It looks like both parties are accelerating that.
[01:24:04.686 --> 01:24:08.447]  So, yeah, World War III might be lessening, but they could stage an event.
[01:24:08.667 --> 01:24:09.968]  I mean, what are the breaks?
[01:24:10.008 --> 01:24:10.708]  What do you see happening?
[01:24:12.353 --> 01:24:26.639]  Well, I think one of the things to keep in mind is that a lot of what we're seeing is really motivated not by some grand long-term master plan, but by a lot of people just kind of looking out for their own immediate gain.
[01:24:27.079 --> 01:24:28.620]  And I'll give you one small example.
[01:24:29.262 --> 01:24:29.543]  I don't
[01:24:48.064 --> 01:24:49.824]  Serving, greedy, reckless behavior.
[01:24:50.125 --> 01:25:13.130]  So you have American companies going back to this end of the American dream that Paul Craig Roberts was writing about, where you have companies that are going out, they're avoiding hiring Americans, they're getting low-paid foreign visa workers to come on in because it lowers their costs and increases their profits and they get their stock bonuses and everything, and they're not thinking about where are my customers going to come from?
[01:25:13.944 --> 01:25:18.966]  And it's this short-sightedness where everybody's doing the same thing and nobody's really thinking about...
[01:25:19.454 --> 01:25:28.120]  You know, if we're not paying our workers, then our, you know, these are our customers that we're shortchanging, they're going to stop buying stuff when the credit rate is up, which is what we're having.
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:28.760]  Exactly.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:44.351]  Now the subprime is leveraged, now the credit cards are leveraged, there is over a thousand trillion in derivatives, and I mean, every angle you look at this, not just in the U.S., but globally, it just goes from bad to worse, Mike.
[01:25:45.453 --> 01:25:47.074]  Yeah, I mean there's no credit crisis.
[01:25:47.094 --> 01:25:48.454]  There's plenty of credit available.
[01:25:48.515 --> 01:25:50.115]  I'm getting offers in the mail.
[01:25:50.135 --> 01:25:51.756]  Just yesterday I got a couple more here.
[01:25:51.976 --> 01:25:57.379]  What we have is a repayment crisis because we have so turned our back on the product.
[01:26:00.251 --> 01:26:05.754]  on the item being sold and we have been so focused on the deal-making to get it sold.
[01:26:06.475 --> 01:26:08.456]  I work on commercials as part of my day job.
[01:26:08.516 --> 01:26:13.759]  I direct commercials for local TV stations and I've been seeing car commercials on the air.
[01:26:13.779 --> 01:26:15.340]  They don't even talk about the cars anymore.
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:17.681]  The come on is we can arrange the financing.
[01:26:17.921 --> 01:26:19.022]  We can get you the loan.
[01:26:19.222 --> 01:26:20.903]  We can get you the best deal on the interest.
[01:26:21.383 --> 01:26:24.946]  They don't even talk about the cars they're selling anymore, and we're seeing the same thing in the stores.
[01:26:25.307 --> 01:26:28.890]  Come on in, whatever you need, no interest for 12 months on the payments.
[01:26:29.771 --> 01:26:33.895]  Nobody even talks about, this is a good car, this is a good TV, or this is a high-quality product.
[01:26:34.175 --> 01:26:38.739]  We've completely turned our back on the idea of making something people want to buy.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:44.064]  And it's because of this, you know, we've been sucked down this huge debt hole,
[01:26:44.776 --> 01:26:52.081]  And nobody can repay it anymore because everybody was looking out for what was going to do their best profit.
[01:26:52.401 --> 01:26:52.982]  I agree.
[01:26:53.122 --> 01:27:03.669]  But above that, the international financial architecture, the central banks that are privately owned, that set up the conditions, the atmosphere, where this would breed.
[01:27:04.069 --> 01:27:09.393]  It's like if you set out a big tub of water during the summer, you know mosquitoes are going to end up being in it.
[01:27:09.793 --> 01:27:12.235]  They, in their own documents, say they set this up
[01:27:12.896 --> 01:27:34.854]  To create a global financial black hole that physically cannot be paid back, and then they end up buying and owning and controlling through fiat the entire planet, and then they say they'll use a police state to clamp down during the consolidation phase, but then most of the experts that look at it say the implosion, if it happens, is going to be so big that it'll just even destroy the elite!
[01:27:35.859 --> 01:27:40.925]  Yeah, it absolutely will, because it's all resting on this huge hole of debt.
[01:27:41.285 --> 01:27:43.968]  The real wealth to pay it off, as you say, it just isn't there.
[01:27:44.028 --> 01:27:51.597]  When you create a fiat monetary system, on day one, more money is owed than is really in existence, so it can never
[01:27:52.237 --> 01:27:54.920]  I mean, where does that go Mike?
[01:28:11.158 --> 01:28:16.900]  It will implode and it will pull the whole structure down with it, and we're seeing basically the equivalent of the fall of Rome.
[01:28:17.201 --> 01:28:17.561]  Stay there.
[01:28:17.581 --> 01:28:24.863]  I want to hear what you think the fall of Rome is going to look like, because if Europe and England and Asia think they're not going to be sucked in with this, they've got another thing coming.
[01:28:24.883 --> 01:28:32.106]  Yeah, we're the first, you know what, to go down the toilet bowl, but you're going with us, and I just want to see where Mike thinks this is going.
[01:28:32.366 --> 01:28:35.647]  Then we'll talk about how the globalists could try to stage another event and pull themselves out of this.
[01:28:36.808 --> 01:28:37.768]  We're on the march.
[01:28:38.208 --> 01:28:39.709]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:40.721 --> 01:28:43.415]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:46.798 --> 01:28:48.479]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.441]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[01:28:50.621 --> 01:28:54.644]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[01:28:54.864 --> 01:28:57.907]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[01:28:58.067 --> 01:29:01.910]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[01:29:02.050 --> 01:29:04.452]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[01:29:04.572 --> 01:29:10.857]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices, restaurants, retail, warehouses, construction, and more.
[01:29:10.957 --> 01:29:14.900]  TWRadios.com is the Internet's leading two-way radio provider.
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:15.801]  We're good to go.
[01:29:31.971 --> 01:29:33.372]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:29:33.452 --> 01:29:36.074]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:29:36.114 --> 01:29:41.898]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:29:57.408 --> 01:30:00.030]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:30:00.490 --> 01:30:04.893]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run.
[01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:07.295]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:30:07.715 --> 01:30:12.958]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:30:13.338 --> 01:30:15.040]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:18.802]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:30:19.382 --> 01:30:22.763]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[01:30:22.803 --> 01:30:29.786]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[01:30:30.126 --> 01:30:35.528]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:30:35.848 --> 01:30:38.749]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now!
[01:30:39.009 --> 01:30:39.409]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:30:39.429 --> 01:30:39.789]  That's 888-873-7371 today!
[01:30:46.408 --> 01:30:48.069]  You wear a seatbelt in your car.
[01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:49.631]  At home, you lock the doors.
[01:30:49.911 --> 01:30:51.632]  How about when you use your cell phone?
[01:30:51.832 --> 01:30:53.013]  How do you protect yourself?
[01:30:53.293 --> 01:30:58.938]  EMFs, or electromagnetic frequencies, act like an invisible pollution that surrounds us every day.
[01:30:59.158 --> 01:31:05.303]  Studies link EMFs to many ailments, from stress to depression, anxiety, decreased mental performance,
[01:31:08.764 --> 01:31:13.566]  More than ever we are fatigued, sick, emotionally depleted and generally stressed out.
[01:31:13.706 --> 01:31:18.288]  Have you ever thought about the impact on your health from exposure to EMFs using your cell phone?
[01:31:18.448 --> 01:31:25.751]  Studies show that 30 minutes a day on a cell phone over the span of one year is equivalent to sticking your head in a microwave for 30 minutes.
[01:31:25.991 --> 01:31:26.111]  Yes.
[01:31:26.131 --> 01:31:32.374]  Installing the BioPro cell phone chip utilizes patented noise field technology to block harmful EMF pollution.

[01:32:13.407 --> 01:32:17.069]  Everybody knows the fight is fixed.
[01:32:17.589 --> 01:32:21.731]  The poor stay poor, the rich get rich.
[01:32:21.891 --> 01:32:23.872]  That's how it goes.
[01:32:23.952 --> 01:32:25.152]  Everybody knows.
[01:32:29.751 --> 01:32:30.351]  In game!
[01:32:30.371 --> 01:32:38.573]  The blueprint for global enslavement is out.

[01:33:00.296 --> 01:33:03.218]  Some areas of the U.S., in very rural areas, is five days.
[01:33:03.979 --> 01:33:06.021]  We ship it all UPS ground, unless you have a P.O.
[01:33:06.041 --> 01:33:07.102]  box, and it's got to be mail.
[01:33:07.482 --> 01:33:12.567]  But by cutting it off to 16th, you should get it a few days before Christmas, even when we ship it out priority mail.

[01:35:30.895 --> 01:35:36.139]  That's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.

[01:35:46.006 --> 01:35:46.967]  It's so important.

[01:35:50.049 --> 01:35:52.351]  Give the gift of truth this holiday season, this Christmas.
[01:35:53.011 --> 01:35:59.014]  And while you're at it, be sure and give him a WhatReallyHappened.com t-shirt by going to WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:35:59.054 --> 01:36:04.797]  My little present to Mike there, plucking that, with his little present coming on the show with his excellent analysis.
[01:36:04.817 --> 01:36:11.020]  You know, I didn't interrupt Paul Roberts, Paul Craig Roberts very much, but I didn't do that with Mike because he makes me think about so many things.
[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:20.064]  He's so intelligent, just, I mean, he's one of the very few people that gets the full spectrum and is very conservative in his presentation, very accurate.
[01:36:20.765 --> 01:36:21.305]  And I know we've got
[01:36:22.106 --> 01:36:24.708]  George-O, Leo, John, Joe, Jay.
[01:36:24.768 --> 01:36:29.311]  I want to start going to those in the next few minutes, but I want to move real quick right now with Mike.
[01:36:30.092 --> 01:36:30.332]  Mike...
[01:36:31.969 --> 01:36:33.409]  Where do you see this going?
[01:36:33.469 --> 01:36:39.730]  I mean, I don't just see the neocons closing up their tents and shopping, leaving town like a pack of New World War Gypsies.
[01:36:40.991 --> 01:36:45.892]  I mean, when you got Gary Hart writing letters to Iran saying, we staged terror attacks, you better watch it.
[01:36:46.392 --> 01:36:50.052]  We've got Republican memos now confirmed flying around saying they need terror attacks.
[01:36:50.332 --> 01:36:53.913]  You've got Hillary pro-war, the Democratic leadership pro-war.
[01:36:54.353 --> 01:36:55.993]  Where do you see this going?
[01:36:56.874 --> 01:36:59.354]  And then what are the different scenarios as they unravel?
[01:37:00.908 --> 01:37:07.431]  Well, obviously we're seeing a huge faction fight begin to emerge within the upper levels of the federal government itself.
[01:37:07.831 --> 01:37:15.755]  We have a large portion of the government realizes war with Iran would be a mistake because it's inevitably going to lead to war with Russia.
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:18.982]  Which a lot of people prudently wish to avoid.
[01:37:19.623 --> 01:37:23.967]  But you've got the true believers who are out there who still think we need to go into Iran.
[01:37:23.987 --> 01:37:29.051]  They're still trying to follow the original PNAC plan of seven different wars of conquest in the Middle East.
[01:37:30.232 --> 01:37:36.077]  You've got that faction that sees conquering and controlling all of the Middle East oil as the only way to save the U.S.
[01:37:36.117 --> 01:37:36.518]  economy.
[01:37:37.018 --> 01:37:40.901]  From imploding, and you've got all these factions fighting with each other.
[01:37:41.242 --> 01:37:55.633]  I think the reason the NIE got released yesterday is that there's a larger and larger group within the government that says, this has gone on long enough that war with Iran will be the end of the United States, that we could lose it to the point of the destruction of the nation itself.
[01:37:56.493 --> 01:38:01.137]  And I think the factionalization is just going to continue because there isn't any one voice
[01:38:01.618 --> 01:38:09.221]  That is speaking that the rest of the factions are going to listen to and say, okay, maybe there's a common cause because that's really kind of gone away.
[01:38:09.541 --> 01:38:25.567]  Now, as far as the larger picture of globalism, as you know, I'm opposed to globalism because creating a globalist society, to me, is about as prudent as removing fireproof doors from a building or watertight bulkheads from a ship.
[01:38:26.768 --> 01:38:29.789]  Nation states provide natural compartments to contain
[01:38:30.374 --> 01:38:35.714]  Economic and sociological disasters and if you have just one planet government
[01:38:36.152 --> 01:38:43.074]  What happens when a Hitler rises to power in that one planet government, as it inevitably, historically, will?
[01:38:44.234 --> 01:38:51.416]  And, you know, you don't have the other nations around the world that act as a check and a balance on that sort of an individual.
[01:38:52.136 --> 01:39:01.958]  As far as the New World Order itself, I think the people who are working towards it, whether it's George Bush Senior, I think it is merely the attainment of that goal is what drives them.
[01:39:02.298 --> 01:39:05.599]  I don't know that they even really have any clear plan of what they're going to do with it.
[01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:12.916]  Once they've got it, I see it a lot like Alexander the Great, who spent his entire life building a bigger and bigger empire.
[01:39:12.956 --> 01:39:15.558]  In the instant he died, it fragmented and fell apart.
[01:39:16.759 --> 01:39:24.927]  So, I'm sure that a lot of people who see themselves as a future leader of the New World Order, they all have a bunch of different ideas they want to try out.
[01:39:25.207 --> 01:39:29.891]  But again, going back to the model of Rome, I see just the infighting continuing.
[01:39:30.231 --> 01:39:30.752]  There'll be a
[01:39:31.212 --> 01:39:31.432]  Absolutely.
[01:39:31.452 --> 01:39:32.853]  It starts to fragment and fall apart.
[01:39:51.286 --> 01:40:06.938]  And one thing that we know is true in the modern technological age of the Internet, these processes happen much, much faster, because the controlling factor has always been the speed with which the reality of their government spreads out to the people.
[01:40:07.298 --> 01:40:14.444]  And obviously in medieval times, when a lot of people didn't even read and there was no printing, these kind of shenanigans could go on for a very, very long time.
[01:40:14.644 --> 01:40:15.024]  Mike!
[01:40:15.425 --> 01:40:15.645]  Mike!
[01:40:15.685 --> 01:40:15.985]  Go ahead.
[01:40:17.066 --> 01:40:17.667]  No, no, go ahead.
[01:40:18.167 --> 01:40:19.388]  Well, no, no, finish your thought.
[01:40:20.391 --> 01:40:33.635]  I was going to say, you know, even in the 1960s, because TV was controlled and there was no internet, it took, you know, 20, 30 years before people realized that John Kennedy was the victim of a government conspiracy, rather than just Lee Oswald.
[01:40:33.695 --> 01:40:39.877]  And yet here, you know, today with the internet and alternative radio, the lies that got us into Iraq were exposed in mere months.
[01:40:40.137 --> 01:40:45.339]  The lies getting us into Iran have been exposed even before the war starts.
[01:40:45.399 --> 01:40:49.820]  And it's because of the pressure coming from the people who are aware that their government lies.
[01:40:50.894 --> 01:40:53.676]  What about the 25% of the public or so?
[01:40:53.696 --> 01:40:57.399]  40% is still dumbed down, but they know not to trust the government, 20% of them or so.
[01:40:58.079 --> 01:41:08.027]  But of that 40%, and I'm looking at hundreds of different polls and kind of indexing them in my mind here with a dead reckoning, but the neocons have now got talking points.
[01:41:08.067 --> 01:41:10.909]  We got these last year, this is public, now they've got Glenn Beck.
[01:41:11.693 --> 01:41:12.174]  We're good to go.
[01:41:22.388 --> 01:41:23.950]  Uh, we now see this talking point.
[01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:29.035]  Lots of bloggers, lots of well-known Republican operatives saying we're traitors, we're criminals.
[01:41:29.496 --> 01:41:32.559]  The White House saying New York Times writers are traitors.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:38.505]  I mean, we're really seeing a talking point where, I guess, like cockroaches have been sprayed with poison.
[01:41:38.525 --> 01:41:41.529]  They're trying to, you know, gobble and fornicate.
[01:41:42.546 --> 01:41:50.872]  They are really, it seems, intending to just try to go ahead and at least have a domestic police state, and they're like throwing a fit now that people are waking up to them.
[01:41:51.372 --> 01:41:52.713]  How do you see that unfolding?
[01:41:54.615 --> 01:42:03.021]  I see it unfolding pretty much what happened in Romania is the model, where everybody is aware of what's going on, they're still being polite, they're still being quiet.
[01:42:03.861 --> 01:42:11.407]  And, you know, we have a saying that we have overheard, WhatReallyHappened.com, which is the fastest way to bring down a dictator is to force them to act like one where everybody can see it.
[01:42:12.396 --> 01:42:19.382]  And I think we're at that stage right now where, you know, they're just screaming, they're being reactive, they're saying these terrible things.
[01:42:20.102 --> 01:42:31.591]  I don't, you know, I think the instant they try and actually implement this stuff, I think we're approaching the point where the American people are going to react, and it will be over in about two weeks, the same has happened in Romania.
[01:42:32.171 --> 01:42:36.635]  If you go back two weeks before Ceaușescu was machine-gunned on Romanian television,
[01:42:37.082 --> 01:42:44.225]  People looking from the outside said, well, you know, he's got it, it's working, he's got TV cameras in every street corner, but the Romanians seem okay with that.
[01:42:44.625 --> 01:42:50.327]  And then two weeks later, you know, he was dead, and people looked and said, well, I guess the Romanians weren't all that happy with what was going on.
[01:42:50.667 --> 01:42:52.368]  Unbelievable.
[01:42:52.388 --> 01:42:53.388]  How do you see that happening here?
[01:42:54.969 --> 01:43:05.633]  Well, I just, you know, I see people, Mike, and we're going to your calls, who are still totally obsessed with the Cowboys versus the Redskins.
[01:43:06.848 --> 01:43:09.969]  They're still totally obsessed with all these things that don't matter.
[01:43:09.989 --> 01:43:13.630]  And by that, you can still watch football, folks.
[01:43:13.650 --> 01:43:17.471]  You can still have, you know, little dalliances in your life.
[01:43:18.111 --> 01:43:20.331]  But you've got to still know where the U.S.
[01:43:20.391 --> 01:43:21.032]  is on a globe.
[01:43:21.052 --> 01:43:22.812]  You've still got to know who the Vice President is.
[01:43:22.852 --> 01:43:24.933]  You've still got to know what the Fourth Amendment is.
[01:43:25.013 --> 01:43:28.674]  So we have a huge mass that still is kind of just tuned out.
[01:43:29.234 --> 01:43:34.275]  And I mean, I'm literally every day losing sleep, freaked out, constantly talking about it with my friends and family.
[01:43:34.795 --> 01:43:35.315]  We're good to go.
[01:43:54.705 --> 01:43:56.967]  What would you say, Mike, to somebody driving along in their car?
[01:43:57.147 --> 01:44:06.332]  I get their emails and calls just saying we're complete liars, the North American Union doesn't exist, the NAFTA highway doesn't exist when it's all over our local news and they're building it.
[01:44:07.113 --> 01:44:08.754]  I mean, it just seems like there's two worlds.
[01:44:08.794 --> 01:44:12.716]  There's those that are informed and then those that just are literally in la-la land.
[01:44:13.017 --> 01:44:15.258]  What are they going to do as this continues to unravel?
[01:44:16.417 --> 01:44:22.141]  Well, they're in denial, and my advice is don't waste time on them, because there's so few of them, is my experience.
[01:44:22.421 --> 01:44:25.063]  You need to work together with the people who have woken up.
[01:44:25.463 --> 01:44:28.125]  They're aware of what's going on, because you need to be talking with them.
[01:44:28.656 --> 01:44:37.078]  And as you talk out in public, you're going to find those people who are sitting on the fence, so to speak, and they're going to say, yeah, I agree with you, and they're going to come forward and start talking.
[01:44:37.378 --> 01:44:47.901]  The ones who are totally in denial, the ones who are obviously, you know, FBI informants whose job it is to go around the society and scream traitor at people like us, you know, ignore them.
[01:44:47.941 --> 01:44:50.582]  You know, it's a waste of time to talk with them and everything.
[01:44:50.942 --> 01:44:52.523]  And you know, I'll share a story with you.
[01:44:52.643 --> 01:44:53.103]  I have a
[01:44:54.285 --> 01:45:01.170]  I have a brother-in-law that we got together with him two nights ago because his daughter is out here serving on a Navy ship.
[01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:08.255]  The last time I met with him before that, we ended up screaming at each other over Bush and his war in Iraq.
[01:45:08.675 --> 01:45:14.939]  Two nights ago, he was pleasant, he's very obviously changed his mind, he's come on board, he understands what's going on.
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:21.104]  So people are changing, and I don't think it's 20% out there who still think the President is doing a good job.
[01:45:21.849 --> 01:45:28.073]  Those opinion polls are being just as dicked with as anything else coming out of the government.
[01:45:28.434 --> 01:45:29.454]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:45:29.775 --> 01:45:33.577]  I agree with you because the index of polls shows Congress between 11 and 12 points.
[01:45:35.841 --> 01:45:37.923]  And Congress has never been universally hated.
[01:45:38.564 --> 01:45:42.066]  And that's pretty much universal derision when it's at that level.
[01:45:42.507 --> 01:45:44.989]  But again, the establishment isn't stopping.
[01:45:45.029 --> 01:45:49.192]  I think they have that arrogant sickness that heights of power bring.
[01:45:49.993 --> 01:45:51.394]  They're a bunch of megalomaniacs.
[01:45:53.255 --> 01:45:55.337]  Mike, let me tell you, I think it's going to end up bad.
[01:45:55.357 --> 01:45:58.319]  I mean, I know you think it's going to fall apart like Russia, and that's on the good end.
[01:45:58.499 --> 01:46:02.122]  I think this could get... These people are... I mean, they could set off nukes next week!
[01:46:02.162 --> 01:46:03.043]  These people are nuts!
[01:46:04.264 --> 01:46:05.265]  Absolutely they are.
[01:46:05.325 --> 01:46:06.266]  They're sociopaths.
[01:46:06.326 --> 01:46:11.330]  I think the majority of people are so compromised they really can't exercise their own discretion anymore.
[01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:16.254]  And there's no question we're going to see a crisis of some kind.
[01:46:16.858 --> 01:46:21.422]  And what happens on the far side of that crisis, of course, is a matter of speculation.
[01:46:21.882 --> 01:46:23.063]  You could very well be right.
[01:46:23.143 --> 01:46:25.605]  I hope you're wrong with all due respect.
[01:46:25.685 --> 01:46:27.467]  Well, I'm not even saying I'm right.
[01:46:27.547 --> 01:46:30.549]  I'm saying that it's definitely in the cards.
[01:46:30.569 --> 01:46:32.090]  It's possible.
[01:46:32.190 --> 01:46:33.251]  Definitely it's possible.
[01:46:33.271 --> 01:46:34.292]  The potential is there.
[01:46:35.013 --> 01:46:36.774]  But, you know, we are headed to a crisis.
[01:46:36.854 --> 01:46:38.876]  I think we're getting into that end phase right now.
[01:46:39.381 --> 01:46:43.844]  Where the government is starting to factionalize badly and openly in front of the public.
[01:46:44.164 --> 01:46:47.406]  And you know the funny thing about government, in a lot of ways it's like a religion.
[01:46:47.566 --> 01:46:51.889]  It relies on the blind faith and trust of the ruled masses.
[01:46:52.409 --> 01:46:56.692]  And it's just like when the church started having to deal with all these child molestation cases.
[01:46:57.085 --> 01:46:59.127]  And that confidence and trust began to falter.
[01:46:59.467 --> 01:47:01.969]  Now we see the government openly caught lying.
[01:47:02.669 --> 01:47:04.010]  It's fragmenting before us.
[01:47:04.330 --> 01:47:10.815]  That trust and faith in the government as infallible is definitely gone.
[01:47:11.116 --> 01:47:15.559]  And once you reach that stage, you know, the lifespan of that government is definitely short.
[01:47:15.899 --> 01:47:26.996]  By the way, I mean, I hardly watch movies, but every movie I see, I'm kind of a science fiction addict, so I watch Children of Men, Transformers, you know, everything has an anti-government message in it now.
[01:47:28.354 --> 01:47:34.798]  Well, yeah, Hollywood's finally coming on board, and it's really a case of making the movies that the audience wants to see.
[01:47:35.498 --> 01:47:44.763]  As you know, they put out a lot of pro-war, pro-America, go-get-the-terrorist blockbusters last year that just absolutely failed at the box office, because people don't want to see that anymore.
[01:47:45.344 --> 01:47:46.124]  They're tired of it.
[01:47:46.224 --> 01:47:56.530]  And yeah, films with an anti-war message are definitely going to be big box office in the coming years, and if there are any motion picture producers who are listening to this, I am available as a technical consultant.
[01:47:56.932 --> 01:47:59.433]  And you'll get your visual effects supervision thrown in for free.
[01:48:00.473 --> 01:48:04.574]  Hey, Mike, I thought you didn't want to tell folks, you do some of the biggest TV shows out there.
[01:48:05.514 --> 01:48:14.256]  Yeah, I've been working in film and TV visual effects for some 30 odd years now, and you can look me up on the Internet Movie Database.
[01:48:14.276 --> 01:48:18.156]  Well, since you just said that, why not tell folks you do one of the biggest TV shows right now?
[01:48:18.877 --> 01:48:25.218]  Yeah, I do visual effects on Lost, and unfortunately with the writer's strike, we're all on an enforced vacation right now.
[01:48:26.488 --> 01:48:34.972]  But yeah, and it's a good crew, and I have a lot of fun on the show, and hopefully, you know, the writer's strike will be over, and we'll be back to finishing Season 4 very shortly.
[01:48:35.432 --> 01:48:38.654]  But yeah, I produce and direct TV commercials here.
[01:48:39.234 --> 01:48:40.755]  I work on movies and stuff.
[01:48:41.355 --> 01:48:50.379]  And, you know, for the longest time, for a while there, I really was blacklisted out of the industry, but I've managed to start getting my career back, and I'm very grateful for it.
[01:48:50.419 --> 01:48:51.760]  But at the same time,
[01:48:52.358 --> 01:48:57.260]  You know, as you say, these issues that we're dealing with in our society today, they must be dealt with.
[01:48:57.901 --> 01:49:03.843]  And, you know, we have to confront that evil that has taken hold of our government at the highest levels.
[01:49:04.784 --> 01:49:10.046]  And if we don't, if we don't, you know, then think of the world we're going to leave to our children.
[01:49:10.947 --> 01:49:11.747]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:11.827 --> 01:49:12.567]  Okay, I promise.
[01:49:12.627 --> 01:49:17.990]  Giorgio, Leo, Jonathan, Joe, Jay, we're going to get to all of you right now.
[01:49:18.010 --> 01:49:20.451]  Mike's going to be with us for 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:49:21.161 --> 01:49:22.121]  We're going to have a quick break.
[01:49:22.161 --> 01:49:23.722]  Come right back and start taking your calls.
[01:49:23.762 --> 01:49:25.862]  I want to get at least two of them in in this next segment.
[01:49:25.882 --> 01:49:26.863]  Save your questions and comments.
[01:49:26.883 --> 01:49:27.283]  We're ready.
[01:49:28.343 --> 01:49:30.784]  And Mike Rivera again riding shotgun with us.
[01:49:30.844 --> 01:49:32.424]  Don't forget, it's the season.
[01:49:32.925 --> 01:49:33.885]  Give the gift of truth.
[01:49:34.425 --> 01:49:35.525]  Don't fight the crowds.

[01:49:49.770 --> 01:49:50.770]  A new world order.
[01:49:51.517 --> 01:49:56.543]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:49:56.583 --> 01:49:58.164]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:49:59.105 --> 01:50:01.508]  Is that their objective, being world domination?
[01:50:02.029 --> 01:50:04.451]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:05.212 --> 01:50:12.580]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:15.543 --> 01:50:20.546]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:21.007 --> 01:50:24.489]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:24.849 --> 01:50:27.391]  Build a very good space to make progress toward a world government.
[01:50:27.431 --> 01:50:28.572]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:28.592 --> 01:50:29.352]  They're not after money.
[01:50:29.392 --> 01:50:30.453]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:30.653 --> 01:50:31.454]  They're after power.
[01:50:31.634 --> 01:50:32.655]  That's what they're after.
[01:50:32.795 --> 01:50:37.358]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:50:44.302 --> 01:50:45.503]  You have been warned.
[01:50:46.123 --> 01:50:51.426]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.

[01:51:46.407 --> 01:51:56.070]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[01:51:56.130 --> 01:52:01.131]  The whole country's on a bus, a crazy driver, but the passengers can't get hold of the wheel.
[01:52:01.491 --> 01:52:02.792]  We're all gonna go over the cliff.
[01:52:02.812 --> 01:52:06.394]  The government's gonna know where everybody's ass is every minute of the day and night.
[01:52:31.271 --> 01:52:31.531]  We're good.
[01:52:49.202 --> 01:52:50.863]  Your call's in 60 seconds.
[01:52:51.223 --> 01:52:54.585]  First off, we're living in very uncertain times right now.
[01:52:55.125 --> 01:52:59.287]  We have high-quality, grown-in-America, storable foods, freeze-dried.
[01:52:59.307 --> 01:53:00.527]  They store very easily.
[01:53:01.047 --> 01:53:03.629]  Last more than 10 years in a climate-controlled area.
[01:53:03.829 --> 01:53:04.629]  10 years if it's not.
[01:53:05.329 --> 01:53:07.931]  It is the highest quality storable foods for the price out there.
[01:53:07.951 --> 01:53:08.631]  You're going to find
[01:53:09.614 --> 01:53:11.175]  It is the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[01:53:11.195 --> 01:53:13.376]  The website is efoodsdirect.com.
[01:53:13.916 --> 01:53:14.896]  efoodsdirect.com.
[01:53:14.916 --> 01:53:16.837]  There's going to be a food increase next year.
[01:53:16.877 --> 01:53:17.577]  It's still worth it.
[01:53:18.078 --> 01:53:22.540]  But get your orders in by Christmas to be able to get it at the lower prices.
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:25.601]  It's been in the news that food prices have gone up and they make big food buys.
[01:53:25.841 --> 01:53:28.182]  They're about to run out of food at the earlier price.
[01:53:29.039 --> 01:53:37.822]  Give him a call at 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or online at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:53:37.862 --> 01:53:42.484]  At least go to the website, look at all their fine products, or call them and get a free catalog at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:53:43.284 --> 01:53:49.246]  If you missed the website, there's big banners on the top of prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:53:49.546 --> 01:53:52.647]  Giorgio, New York, you've been holding patiently.
[01:53:52.667 --> 01:53:53.747]  You're on the air with Mike Rivera.
[01:53:54.027 --> 01:53:55.328]  Hello, hello Alex.
[01:53:55.508 --> 01:53:55.788]  Hi.
[01:53:56.628 --> 01:53:57.569]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[01:53:57.589 --> 01:53:58.549]  It's indeed an honor.
[01:53:58.885 --> 01:53:59.746]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[01:54:00.406 --> 01:54:00.766]  Thank you.
[01:54:01.146 --> 01:54:03.127]  Just quickly, I've got three points.
[01:54:03.928 --> 01:54:07.850]  One, I'm actually from Australia and I immigrated to New York four years ago.
[01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:12.053]  I'm an acupuncturist and been working in the field for 16 years.
[01:54:12.633 --> 01:54:23.379]  And in Australia, I also wanted to comment, I've watched Endgame and I've ordered five of those and five loose change and I buy Innafood and I support your products and your website as well.
[01:54:23.399 --> 01:54:23.739]  Thank you.
[01:54:23.799 --> 01:54:24.640]  Couldn't do it without you.
[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:25.120]  Couldn't do it.
[01:54:27.105 --> 01:54:47.915]  Talking about eugenics quickly, most people aren't aware, but in the 1920s in Australia, one of the English parliamentarians actually proclaimed in Parliament that they were trying to extinct the Aboriginal race, and he actually declared in Parliament that the Aboriginal race would be extinct by 1980.
[01:54:47.955 --> 01:54:49.536]  I did run into that in my
[01:54:52.387 --> 01:54:54.569]  Research for Endgame, but just didn't have time to add it.
[01:54:54.929 --> 01:54:55.169]  Right.
[01:54:55.689 --> 01:55:06.597]  And what most people don't know is that they used to foster out the families for Aboriginal children for about 80 years and used to split the families up all over Australia.
[01:55:06.757 --> 01:55:19.325]  And I happen to be one of the very few acupuncturists who was actually brought on a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program in a little town in Australia, and I actually worked on these people.
[01:55:19.815 --> 01:55:26.678]  And what most people don't know is the English, about a hundred years ago, just used to pay the Aboriginals with rum.
[01:55:27.219 --> 01:55:30.240]  Never actually let them integrate into society on purpose.
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:34.642]  Well, that's a British policy that the US then picked up.
[01:55:35.123 --> 01:55:36.904]  People said the Indians are a bunch of drunks.
[01:55:36.964 --> 01:55:38.004]  That's how we'd pay them.
[01:55:38.384 --> 01:55:38.865]  That's right.
[01:55:39.085 --> 01:55:40.425]  The whole history...
[01:55:42.034 --> 01:55:44.995]  Their grandfathers, great-grandfathers, they're brought up on that.
[01:55:45.075 --> 01:55:49.616]  You know, I'd love you to send me some info, and maybe have you on as a guest.
[01:55:49.696 --> 01:55:51.377]  Email it to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:51.397 --> 01:55:53.477]  But let me get a comment from Mike Rivera on this.
[01:55:53.538 --> 01:55:53.758]  Mike?
[01:55:54.618 --> 01:55:55.618]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:55:55.698 --> 01:56:03.461]  When you have, you know, one group going in to invade another, yeah, they'll throw alcohol at them and then deride them as being drunk.
[01:56:03.521 --> 01:56:08.122]  We saw that here in the Pacific when the Christian missionaries showed up in Tahiti.
[01:56:09.095 --> 01:56:18.378]  You know, they got the king hooked on alcohol and converted him to Christianity and then incited wars against the neighboring, what are now French Polynesian islands.
[01:56:18.818 --> 01:56:25.300]  And then what they did is they burned down all the breadfruit trees so that the locals would have to go to work on the plantations that the missionaries owned.
[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:27.481]  And you see this time and time again.
[01:56:27.581 --> 01:56:31.882]  And one of the concerns I have about a new world global order is
[01:56:32.395 --> 01:56:40.602]  Which particular group is going to wind up in charge of it, and what will they be thinking of doing to the other ethnic groups now under their rule?
[01:56:40.662 --> 01:56:56.035]  Because, you know, we know that environment and overpopulation is one of the issues that the global New World Order is going to be looking at, and, you know, population's always a problem because sex is so much more fun than dying, and how do they plan on dealing with this?
[01:56:56.747 --> 01:57:04.513]  Yeah, well, the other thing is, you know, I don't want to take too much of your time, but it's so important, this information.
[01:57:04.933 --> 01:57:13.960]  When I worked in the Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Center, they tried to detox these people, but then they would put them on, like, 20 other medications.
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:15.361]  Well, 20's a bit exaggerated.
[01:57:15.441 --> 01:57:16.041]  I'd say 5 or 6.
[01:57:16.302 --> 01:57:22.086]  They'd put them on Valium, they'd put them on antipsychotics, psychotropics, antidepressants.
[01:57:22.186 --> 01:57:22.486]  Stay there.
[01:57:22.506 --> 01:57:24.067]  I'm going to let you finish up and we'll go to the other calls.
[01:57:24.107 --> 01:57:24.628]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:24.668 --> 01:57:25.008]  Third hour.
[01:57:28.456 --> 01:57:30.537]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:31.078 --> 01:57:34.240]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:42.930 --> 01:57:43.571]  Big Brother.
[01:57:44.231 --> 01:57:45.292]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:46.012 --> 01:57:47.093]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:47.774 --> 01:57:48.594]  You want answers?
[01:57:49.335 --> 01:57:50.276]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:50.896 --> 01:57:54.719]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:55.099 --> 01:57:59.222]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:00.143 --> 01:58:03.185]  Into hour number three, and now I want to hurry and get to your calls.
[01:58:03.205 --> 01:58:08.169]  I also want to talk to Mike about the former Italian Prime Minister going public, saying 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:58:08.509 --> 01:58:10.550]  Huge story at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:11.815 --> 01:58:16.857]  I'm talking to Giorgio, formerly from the Land Down Under, now living in New York.
[01:58:17.438 --> 01:58:22.800]  And sir, I was about to say 5, 6, 7, 8, the average Texas foster child is on 7 drugs.
[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:25.741]  That was in WOAI-TV Investigates last year.
[01:58:26.261 --> 01:58:27.622]  That's the same average nationwide.
[01:58:27.642 --> 01:58:29.723]  It's the same thing in New Zealand, Canada.
[01:58:29.783 --> 01:58:30.783]  They even have the same names.
[01:58:30.843 --> 01:58:38.207]  It's Head Start here, Secure Start in England, what's Smart Start in Australia.
[01:58:38.587 --> 01:58:41.088]  I maybe get the names mixed up, but they all have similar names.
[01:58:42.293 --> 01:58:56.385]  And they'll take you off alcohol and say marijuana, and I'm not saying alcohol isn't bad for you folks, and they'll put you on serotonin reuptake inhibitors whose molecules are more dangerous than cocaine and heroin.
[01:58:56.905 --> 01:58:57.986]  Mike Rivero comments.
[01:58:59.082 --> 01:59:10.894]  Well, basically it's just another way of pumping a lot of money into the pharmaceutical industries, and we've got this whole culture of fixing all the problems with a pill or a drug, which are all very expensive.
[01:59:11.395 --> 01:59:18.782]  And we used to go through the same thing in California when they were trying to get the heroin addicts off of heroin by giving them methadone, which is actually more addictive.
[01:59:19.655 --> 01:59:25.917]  And it was somehow okay because they were getting the drugs from the government and not from the criminals.
[01:59:26.077 --> 01:59:27.598]  Well, you know where heroin came from.
[01:59:27.878 --> 01:59:41.282]  They couldn't get the soldiers, the hundreds of thousands of amputees from the Civil War who got addicted to opium, to laudanum, but they learned that something ten times stronger, heroin, a derivative, and it was the cure drug for the opium.
[01:59:43.149 --> 02:00:04.544]  Well, it's really all the same thing, and for a while, opium was legal in this country, and a lot of people don't know this, but the Skull and Bones fraternity at Yale University, which has spawned so many of our presidents, their funding was opium money funding, and it's probably no surprise that during Vietnam, we saw the CIA smuggling a lot of heroin back to the United States through here in Hawaii,
[02:00:05.206 --> 02:00:06.687]  Uh, to the west coast of the U.S.
[02:00:06.748 --> 02:00:10.231]  And the CIA was founded predominantly out of Yale and Skull and Bones.
[02:00:10.511 --> 02:00:12.833]  Thank you, uh, Giorgio, I appreciate your call.
[02:00:12.853 --> 02:00:13.534]  Send me info.
[02:00:13.874 --> 02:00:15.836]  Leo and Matt, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:00:15.856 --> 02:00:18.598]  Uh, Mr. Rivera?
[02:00:18.999 --> 02:00:19.679]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:27.166]  Are you a relative of the Rivera who wrote the book about the, uh, Jesuits' influence in Nazi Germany?
[02:00:29.312 --> 02:00:36.837]  Not that I'm aware of, but you know, I assume at some level we're probably related because we've got the same name, but I'm not aware of a direct connection, no.
[02:00:37.137 --> 02:00:42.921]  Anyway, my problem here is that I feel that we're not communicating properly.
[02:00:43.642 --> 02:00:46.523]  As they say, what we have here is a failure to communicate.
[02:00:47.284 --> 02:00:53.708]  And on the level of the individual to individual, the one-on-one, we have to be the serene ones.
[02:00:53.728 --> 02:00:56.530]  I mean, I love Alex, you know, you jump out
[02:00:56.966 --> 02:01:00.067]  And you scream and you make a big fuss because, hey, that's you.
[02:01:00.867 --> 02:01:14.710]  But in this world of friendly fascism, we have to be the cool, calm, selected ones who just ask a few little pointed questions and let the people who defend 9-11 go up in smoke and go ballistic.
[02:01:14.750 --> 02:01:17.191]  You see, that's the game that's going on here.
[02:01:17.211 --> 02:01:18.651]  If you go ballistic,
[02:01:19.389 --> 02:01:20.190]  You're out of the game.
[02:01:39.094 --> 02:01:44.495]  And I've been pretty darn calm today, and so it isn't about me, sir.
[02:01:44.515 --> 02:01:54.477]  I mean, did you have the huevos to go on air on the day of the event like me and Mike did, and expose it as an inside job?
[02:01:54.497 --> 02:01:58.558]  I mean, I don't mind being criticized, but I think you talk about solutions, Leo.
[02:01:58.818 --> 02:02:01.918]  You're calling in with a solution that we need to be smooth and calm and whatever.
[02:02:02.258 --> 02:02:06.259]  I think it's different strokes for different folks, and different things make the world go around, Mike.
[02:02:07.503 --> 02:02:08.423]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:02:08.884 --> 02:02:09.484]  I'm in agreement.
[02:02:09.504 --> 02:02:21.849]  If you want a polished, smooth, calm performance, then go back to ABC, CNN, NBC, and Fox, and you'll get these very nicely coiffed and made-up talking heads who are very pleasant to look at, who will tell you things that are very pleasant to hear.
[02:02:22.289 --> 02:02:33.114]  But the reality is that the world has become a very dark place, and people like Alex Jones are going to try to get that news out there, and the content is what's important, not the packaging.
[02:02:33.706 --> 02:02:37.428]  We'll be right back with more of your calls on the other side with Mike Rivera, whatreallyhappened.com.
[02:02:39.069 --> 02:02:40.490]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:41.551 --> 02:02:42.591]  A new world order.
[02:02:43.312 --> 02:02:47.754]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[02:02:48.214 --> 02:02:50.976]  It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[02:02:51.036 --> 02:02:53.277]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:02:53.817 --> 02:02:56.219]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:02:56.986 --> 02:03:04.323]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:07.335 --> 02:03:12.338]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:12.799 --> 02:03:16.261]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:16.641 --> 02:03:19.163]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:03:19.223 --> 02:03:20.384]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:20.404 --> 02:03:21.144]  They're not after money.
[02:03:21.164 --> 02:03:22.245]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:22.445 --> 02:03:22.865]  They're after power.
[02:03:22.905 --> 02:03:24.286]  That's what they're after, isn't it?
[02:03:24.587 --> 02:03:29.150]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:04:41.855 --> 02:04:42.375]  are located?
[02:04:42.575 --> 02:04:45.957]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[02:04:58.243 --> 02:04:58.623]  I think so.
[02:05:15.089 --> 02:05:15.590]  I think so.
[02:05:43.183 --> 02:05:47.364]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:05:48.024 --> 02:05:48.845]  You want answers?
[02:05:49.605 --> 02:05:50.605]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:50.985 --> 02:05:55.106]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:55.346 --> 02:05:59.488]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:00.228 --> 02:06:11.211]  Michael will be with us another 15 minutes or so, and then I'm going to get into ex-Italian President, Intel Agencies, no, 9-11 was an inside job, top story on presentplanet.com, a bunch of other news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:06:12.990 --> 02:06:16.714]  We just got another caller into the board of the network going, yes, Alex needs to be calm.
[02:06:17.514 --> 02:06:19.356]  Folks, the economy is imploding.
[02:06:19.376 --> 02:06:20.837]  The New World Order is out of control.
[02:06:20.878 --> 02:06:22.259]  They're trying to start World War III.
[02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:30.727]  I don't come on this show and try to have some angle or have some way I, you know, have a presentation.
[02:06:30.767 --> 02:06:31.648]  Some days I'm very calm.
[02:06:31.668 --> 02:06:32.929]  Some days I start yelling and screaming.
[02:06:34.079 --> 02:06:36.220]  And I want to just ask this quick question to Mike Rivero.
[02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:39.542]  Mike, I know you've written about and talked about the North American Union.
[02:06:39.582 --> 02:06:40.822]  It's in official documents.
[02:06:41.123 --> 02:06:41.923]  They're setting it up.
[02:06:41.963 --> 02:06:43.144]  They're integrating the economies.
[02:06:43.544 --> 02:06:44.905]  They did the Euro the same way.
[02:06:45.365 --> 02:06:51.648]  And I start yelling and screaming when I play CNN clips where they say Ron Paul is insane and making up imaginary groups.
[02:06:51.708 --> 02:06:53.809]  And they say there's no trans-Texas corridor.
[02:06:54.109 --> 02:06:56.550]  When Perry passed the law, the legislature repealed it.
[02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:57.891]  They're still building it.
[02:06:58.311 --> 02:07:00.552]  It's called that at huge press conferences.
[02:07:00.853 --> 02:07:03.534]  I mean, they're now getting to a level of lying
[02:07:04.372 --> 02:07:05.473]  I've never seen any.
[02:07:05.633 --> 02:07:06.793]  I get mad about that, Mike.
[02:07:07.894 --> 02:07:14.676]  Yeah, I think anger and rage are appropriate reactions right now, and I've written before, everyone says, ooh, hate is bad, hate is bad.
[02:07:15.077 --> 02:07:22.520]  Yeah, sometimes hate can be bad, but sometimes hate is the appropriate reaction to those individuals and those institutions who are doing hateful things.
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:27.602]  And, you know, I'm wondering if this caller or these callers who are saying that we should be calm and
[02:07:29.616 --> 02:07:34.080]  I'm wondering if they're calling up Michael Savage to try and get him to tone down his attacks on Muslims?
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:39.585]  Or if they're calling CNN, who are out there calling the bloggers traitors?
[02:07:40.966 --> 02:07:44.929]  Why are we the ones who are supposed to be calm and sedate?
[02:07:45.419 --> 02:07:51.160]  And is it really just a way to try and get us to attract less notice of the mainstream media that's about to be yelling and screaming?
[02:07:51.420 --> 02:08:06.283]  I was about to say that, and I've even seen memos on this from political parties, for 50 years they've taught us to be quiet, be calm, don't fight city hall, don't talk about politics or religion, don't talk to your neighbors, it's not polite and polite company.
[02:08:06.643 --> 02:08:08.884]  America, and any other free Renaissance nation,
[02:08:09.224 --> 02:08:13.407]  Was formed out of people at stumps and arguments and discussions.
[02:08:13.847 --> 02:08:16.929]  And the football was the news and the politics.
[02:08:16.969 --> 02:08:19.371]  That's what people were into.
[02:08:19.411 --> 02:08:21.513]  And they tell people, don't have dirty campaigns.
[02:08:21.553 --> 02:08:23.294]  Don't bring up dirt on the other candidate.
[02:08:23.634 --> 02:08:24.215]  Be nice.
[02:08:24.255 --> 02:08:25.115]  That's how you win.
[02:08:25.395 --> 02:08:31.500]  But when you actually read the internal memos, it's go as nasty as possible while attacking them if they get nasty.
[02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:33.301]  See, so I, yeah, exactly.
[02:08:34.409 --> 02:08:41.554]  Yeah, it's a way of trying to get us out of the discussion at a time when definitely the hysteria in the mainstream media is on the rise.
[02:08:42.075 --> 02:08:44.176]  Yeah, but I don't think those guys were agents or anything.
[02:08:44.196 --> 02:08:46.078]  I think they're just regurgitating what they've heard.
[02:08:46.778 --> 02:08:48.659]  But again, different strokes for different folks.
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:49.640]  It's kind of a distraction.
[02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:51.662]  Jonathan in Denver, you're on the air.
[02:08:51.722 --> 02:08:52.122]  Go ahead.
[02:08:53.683 --> 02:08:54.624]  Alex, how's it going?
[02:08:55.044 --> 02:08:55.424]  Good, sir.
[02:08:56.265 --> 02:08:58.026]  A long-time listener, first-time caller.
[02:08:58.066 --> 02:09:01.649]  I just wanted to say, that guy who just called, he needs to wake up.
[02:09:02.564 --> 02:09:03.485]  I'm out of Denver, Colorado.
[02:09:03.545 --> 02:09:04.926]  I'm with We Are Change Colorado.
[02:09:04.946 --> 02:09:06.307]  You know, we're being nice.
[02:09:06.447 --> 02:09:10.149]  I think these guys should be confronted on a daily basis.
[02:09:10.189 --> 02:09:14.672]  I think they should be confronted 24-7 when they're eating outside of their homes.
[02:09:15.173 --> 02:09:17.254]  You know, the thing is they're spin artists.
[02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:22.461]  I was recently pulled out of Boulder University.
[02:09:22.481 --> 02:09:24.261]  You actually talked about it last Friday.
[02:09:24.581 --> 02:09:29.022]  We confronted John Ashcroft in Boulder, and I stood up.
[02:09:29.162 --> 02:09:30.883]  They said, we have time for one more question.
[02:09:30.923 --> 02:09:36.824]  I stood up and started talking about Sabel Edmonds, and I was immediately hauled out of there, and I was very polite.
[02:09:37.985 --> 02:09:42.306]  In fact, all of our questions were very kind, and this guy basically didn't answer any of the questions.
[02:09:42.766 --> 02:09:43.726]  He spun the issue.
[02:09:43.746 --> 02:09:45.066]  He cracked jokes at us.
[02:09:45.566 --> 02:09:46.607]  He was very reckless.
[02:09:46.647 --> 02:09:47.587]  He was incompetent.
[02:09:48.092 --> 02:09:49.192]  And this is the truth.
[02:09:49.252 --> 02:09:52.593]  We need to wake up to the reality that these guys are crooks.
[02:09:52.873 --> 02:09:56.633]  And by the way, Jonathan, you were like 15 seconds into your question.
[02:09:56.653 --> 02:09:58.514]  They were already dragging you out.
[02:09:58.554 --> 02:10:00.134]  That video is up on Prison Planet.
[02:10:00.934 --> 02:10:02.875]  Right now, we played the audio last week.
[02:10:03.015 --> 02:10:06.575]  And his whole speech, by the way, was... Talk about that.
[02:10:06.595 --> 02:10:08.455]  It was cryptic police state pushing.
[02:10:08.956 --> 02:10:09.516]  Oh, he was nuts.
[02:10:10.096 --> 02:10:10.636]  He was nuts.
[02:10:10.676 --> 02:10:17.477]  He was spinning it so... First of all, he was talking about how Abu Ghraib and torturing prisoners was some kind of act of humanity.
[02:10:18.164 --> 02:10:21.127]  And that if we don't do that, that that's barbaric?
[02:10:21.468 --> 02:10:22.769]  I mean, it was such a spin.
[02:10:23.250 --> 02:10:28.055]  And it was actually, to be honest with you, he was starting to scare the audience.
[02:10:28.235 --> 02:10:32.400]  Most people, and I think even his supporters, Alex, were a little worried.
[02:10:32.799 --> 02:10:35.782]  Because he was freaking everybody out.
[02:10:36.262 --> 02:10:41.426]  Let me stop you, because I watched the speech, and we should have done an article just about that, not just about you confronting him, because that's the news.
[02:10:41.786 --> 02:10:43.728]  I mean, you confronting him was great, too, and good job.
[02:10:44.068 --> 02:10:44.909]  Gold star there.
[02:10:44.949 --> 02:10:50.774]  But I mean, I've heard you call it into another show, and the point you made is true, that the bigger issue is what he was saying.
[02:10:51.154 --> 02:10:53.696]  But it seems, Mike, I'm not just saying this.
[02:10:53.776 --> 02:10:57.960]  I'm usually pessimistic, because I like to err on the bad side, to not be over-optimistic.
[02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:00.521]  But it does seem like they're getting scared.
[02:11:00.541 --> 02:11:03.282]  They're even saying, well, nobody listens to us anymore.
[02:11:03.322 --> 02:11:04.383]  They think we're liars.
[02:11:04.403 --> 02:11:05.183]  They're traitors!
[02:11:05.243 --> 02:11:05.744]  Arrest them!
[02:11:06.004 --> 02:11:06.464]  Torture!
[02:11:06.504 --> 02:11:07.284]  Kill!
[02:11:07.564 --> 02:11:09.625]  I mean, Mike, it does seem like they're going crazy.
[02:11:10.486 --> 02:11:12.127]  Yeah, the panic is palpable.
[02:11:12.387 --> 02:11:14.668]  And, you know, there's a lot of desperation.
[02:11:14.708 --> 02:11:21.011]  And as I've observed about Bush's reaction to the intelligence estimate, he's not following any carefully thought out plan.
[02:11:21.051 --> 02:11:22.291]  He's in knee-jerk mode.
[02:11:22.992 --> 02:11:25.833]  As each new piece of disinformation gets exposed,
[02:11:26.198 --> 02:11:27.959]  You know, it's false.
[02:11:28.159 --> 02:11:29.259]  They're in league with the enemy.
[02:11:29.339 --> 02:11:30.200]  They're doing what they're doing.
[02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:33.341]  They're totally reactive right now, and totally defensive.
[02:11:33.401 --> 02:11:38.723]  And it's a dangerous time, but at the same time, it does show that their power and influence is on the wane.
[02:11:38.803 --> 02:11:44.665]  And every major neocon show, liberal shows, Fox, CNN, they're all saying, arrest these we are changers.
[02:11:45.445 --> 02:11:47.006]  Other people, they're confronting Hillary.
[02:11:47.126 --> 02:11:48.546]  Taser them, beat them to pulps.
[02:11:48.646 --> 02:11:50.067]  They shouldn't be allowed to ask questions.
[02:11:50.107 --> 02:11:50.967]  And that was on Fox.
[02:11:51.408 --> 02:11:54.269]  I mean, they, and then they do, they act scared!
[02:11:54.529 --> 02:11:59.171]  Because they know that Ceausescu thing, but in a peaceful info war, is happening.
[02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:01.452]  We're gilling out of the web now and hitting the streets.
[02:12:02.779 --> 02:12:09.941]  Yeah, it is breaking out of the internet, and we're capturing a lion's share of the viewership for political news right now.
[02:12:10.301 --> 02:12:15.163]  The mainstream media, the corporate networks, have lost the high ground in the war for the minds of America.
[02:12:15.343 --> 02:12:17.343]  And by the way, it's not hard.
[02:12:17.443 --> 02:12:28.067]  I mean, we see the major, biggest Italian newspaper and TV reporting that the former president, highly respected, went public and said, our government staged terror attacks in Italy before, and we staged 9-11.
[02:12:28.607 --> 02:12:29.307]  That's not hard.
[02:12:29.367 --> 02:12:30.127]  That's big news.
[02:12:30.247 --> 02:12:32.548]  I'm just reporting on huge European news.
[02:12:32.628 --> 02:12:34.073]  Of course I'm going to get visitors.
[02:12:34.113 --> 02:12:36.079]  Of course WhatReallyHappened.com is going to get visitors.
[02:12:37.168 --> 02:12:38.049]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:12:38.089 --> 02:12:39.210]  We're carrying this news.
[02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:43.333]  The foreign press has really been telling a lot of things that Americans need to know about.
[02:12:43.633 --> 02:12:49.317]  And again, as I pointed out earlier in the show, BBC is running the story about the new intelligence estimate on Iran.
[02:12:49.578 --> 02:12:58.144]  They're playing it with all these videotapes of Bush and Cheney from two months ago, screaming that Iran was still building nuclear weapons, just underscoring that it's another lie.
[02:12:58.404 --> 02:12:59.925]  Turn over to CNN and what do you see?
[02:13:00.226 --> 02:13:03.208]  Miss Puerto Rico may or may not have been pepper sprayed.
[02:13:03.616 --> 02:13:08.480]  Obviously, the American mainstream news is still trying to keep this stuff from the American people.
[02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:11.283]  But they keep hemorrhaging MarketShare, but they can't help it!
[02:13:12.404 --> 02:13:13.264]  I've got a question for you.
[02:13:13.324 --> 02:13:15.166]  The owners are telling them, just keep selling it.
[02:13:15.186 --> 02:13:16.327]  Do you remember the movie Network?
[02:13:17.368 --> 02:13:18.209]  Yeah, hold on, Jonathan.
[02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:19.009]  Go ahead and finish, Mike.
[02:13:19.029 --> 02:13:21.211]  Yeah, you remember the movie Network?
[02:13:21.291 --> 02:13:21.391]  Yes.
[02:13:21.492 --> 02:13:24.934]  Where the corporation that bought the TV network said, keep pushing this out.
[02:13:25.035 --> 02:13:27.236]  I don't care if you're losing advertising revenues in MarketShare.
[02:13:27.557 --> 02:13:28.337]  Keep pushing it out.
[02:13:28.638 --> 02:13:29.939]  It's the same situation.
[02:13:29.999 --> 02:13:31.240]  The owners of the media are
[02:13:31.738 --> 02:13:38.381]  Using it for propaganda, and they don't care if they're losing market share, and they're just destroying the networks in the process.
[02:13:38.602 --> 02:13:40.322]  And it's just going to continue until they collapse.
[02:13:41.083 --> 02:13:42.023]  Okay, go ahead, Jonathan.
[02:13:43.624 --> 02:13:45.305]  Mike, it's good to hear you speak.
[02:13:45.725 --> 02:13:47.726]  I go to whatreallyhappened.com all the time.
[02:13:48.787 --> 02:13:50.588]  We're working on a film out here in Colorado.
[02:13:50.848 --> 02:13:53.589]  Actually, I was just on the phone with Jason Burmas a couple of weeks ago.
[02:13:54.309 --> 02:13:59.092]  We have Sandra Hicks out here for some interviews and David Rick Griffin, and we're trying to expose
[02:14:00.013 --> 02:14:25.745]  uh... these guys right now and uh... what do you guys think about the nato what do you think about quality i g and employees whistleblowers of some of these uh... these what prepared to be to me shell company cia shell companies these guys no question in my mind these guys are operational hands in nine eleven they're still you know running free these are the perpetrators the criminals behind nine eleven they're running free nobody's called prosecuting them and uh...
[02:14:28.009 --> 02:14:29.610]  Can we start to confront these guys?
[02:14:29.630 --> 02:14:30.930]  Do we have to be worried about anything?
[02:14:38.573 --> 02:14:43.414]  The greater danger is in doing nothing and letting them dominate and feed and rule over us and keep killing us.
[02:14:44.014 --> 02:14:46.195]  Is there a danger, a heroic danger?
[02:14:46.275 --> 02:14:49.076]  Why, who wouldn't want to take that to confronting them?
[02:14:49.216 --> 02:14:52.156]  I guess there's some, but there's a greater danger overall and not.
[02:14:52.616 --> 02:14:53.677]  I want to be alive.
[02:14:53.757 --> 02:14:54.877]  I want to be in the arena.
[02:14:54.977 --> 02:14:56.037]  I'm only alive once.
[02:14:56.317 --> 02:14:58.778]  History only happens, you know, big things every once in a while.
[02:14:58.818 --> 02:15:02.559]  We're living in the middle of this right now, so I say throw caution to the wind, Mike.
[02:15:03.667 --> 02:15:04.547]  I would agree on that.
[02:15:04.627 --> 02:15:09.669]  Yes, there's a risk, but you know, there are so many people out there doing this confrontation and getting in their faces.
[02:15:09.929 --> 02:15:17.551]  They can't arrest us all, and every time they do, every time they harass another person and they make another martyr on the internet, it only makes them look worse.
[02:15:17.931 --> 02:15:24.333]  The fastest way to bring down a dictator is to get him, to force him to act like one where everybody can see it, and that's what's happening right now.
[02:15:24.473 --> 02:15:25.353]  Let's take another call.
[02:15:25.393 --> 02:15:26.234]  Joe in PA.
[02:15:26.294 --> 02:15:26.894]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:15:26.914 --> 02:15:27.374]  You're on the air.
[02:15:29.985 --> 02:15:37.509]  I'm really glad I called in today because going back to the subject of the economy and all that, the Reagan guy you had on there?
[02:15:37.689 --> 02:15:38.649]  Yeah, Paul Gregg Roberts.
[02:15:38.749 --> 02:15:42.511]  Have you ever heard of, he's an ex-Illuminati guy, Leo Zagami?
[02:15:43.174 --> 02:15:46.616]  You know, I stick with one of the top ten economists alive.
[02:15:46.716 --> 02:15:52.219]  I stick to guys with little devil goatees telling me they comb their hair like devil horns.
[02:15:52.519 --> 02:15:57.362]  I'm not knocking that guy, but yeah, I've looked into all that stuff.
[02:15:57.422 --> 02:16:01.965]  There's a dime a dozen people that tell you they were in the Illuminati and they've got the secret handshake.
[02:16:02.005 --> 02:16:04.887]  Regardless, I try to stick to the things I can prove.
[02:16:05.747 --> 02:16:06.788]  But go ahead and make your point.
[02:16:07.208 --> 02:16:12.371]  Well, I was listening to him talk like he was exposing something, and what I found interesting was
[02:16:12.970 --> 02:16:15.912]  That he was talking about how he was the next guy and he got out.
[02:16:15.972 --> 02:16:19.614]  And one of the reasons was, you know that pyramid thing they got the higher up you go?
[02:16:20.175 --> 02:16:25.198]  He said the higher ups are starting to freak out now because America's falling and all this stuff.
[02:16:25.238 --> 02:16:29.561]  And they said they don't know how they're going to handle it because everything's going to crash.
[02:16:30.221 --> 02:16:31.442]  And they don't know what they're doing.
[02:16:31.482 --> 02:16:41.288]  But what caught my eye this morning, I was listening to Fox News and they were talking about the real estate market and how hot it was down in Florida.
[02:16:41.778 --> 02:16:50.242]  Not for the people that live here, but for the foreign investors and the people with the Euros and China and Russia are going to buy up the properties and everything.
[02:16:50.262 --> 02:16:53.964]  And I'm thinking like, you know, our country is being sold.
[02:16:55.405 --> 02:17:01.327]  The powers that be, our country is going down for us here in the United States, but the
[02:17:03.357 --> 02:17:09.882]  One that are going to buy it up, or you know, they're the ones that have the Euros up there, and they're buying it, so... No, no, this was all engineered, and I appreciate your call.
[02:17:09.922 --> 02:17:12.544]  Mike, let me give you one more segment so we can talk to Jay, John, and Paul.
[02:17:13.384 --> 02:17:13.684]  Okay.
[02:17:13.824 --> 02:17:15.366]  Okay, just one more segment with Michael Rivera.
[02:17:15.386 --> 02:17:18.468]  I'll let him comment on what the last caller was saying.
[02:17:19.088 --> 02:17:20.369]  Look, I don't know about rumors.
[02:17:20.589 --> 02:17:21.930]  I know what the news is reporting.
[02:17:22.511 --> 02:17:27.094]  And I know pretty high-powered folks here in Austin who represent people worth billions of dollars.
[02:17:27.614 --> 02:17:28.615]  They've all left the country.
[02:17:29.230 --> 02:17:31.353]  Okay, I mean, I'm not joking.
[02:17:31.874 --> 02:17:34.418]  The money is acting like this country isn't going to be here.
[02:17:34.818 --> 02:17:36.521]  And they're freaked out, so that is accurate.
[02:17:39.483 --> 02:17:41.444]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[02:17:41.685 --> 02:17:44.307]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[02:17:44.627 --> 02:17:52.933]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[02:17:53.233 --> 02:17:56.055]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[02:17:56.896 --> 02:18:00.118]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[02:18:01.439 --> 02:18:03.000]  How much are you willing to lose?
[02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:04.341]  Take action now!
[02:18:04.461 --> 02:18:08.363]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[02:18:09.283 --> 02:18:13.045]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[02:18:13.265 --> 02:18:16.467]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[02:18:16.587 --> 02:18:18.108]  Current Federal Reserve policy
[02:18:18.288 --> 02:18:18.708]  I think so.
[02:18:39.255 --> 02:18:41.598]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:41.618 --> 02:18:48.007]  Did you know that the mother of all secret societies, the Illuminati, worships Lucifer, better known as Satan the Devil?
[02:18:49.017 --> 02:18:56.361]  Did you know that they are the individuals giving rise to the final world social system described in Revelation Chapter 13?
[02:18:57.261 --> 02:19:01.963]  Did you know they were the founders of international communism to be the seen enemy of Christianity?
[02:19:02.484 --> 02:19:07.906]  To be used to destroy America so that we could be merged into an all-powerful one-world government?

[02:21:00.503 --> 02:21:01.104]  I don't think so.

[02:21:47.290 --> 02:21:50.251]  And of course it will continue with your phone calls, Aaron and Adam and Paul.
[02:21:50.671 --> 02:21:59.234]  Folks will not be able to get to you right now with Mike Rivera, but I'm going to get to Jay in Hawaii where Mike's there and maybe even John before we leave with Mike.
[02:21:59.834 --> 02:22:02.035]  But Mike, I wanted to bring up this article to you.
[02:22:03.092 --> 02:22:14.017]  Ex-Italian President, Intel Knows 9-11 Inside Job, Man Who Blew The Whistle On Operation Gladio Tells Italy's Largest Newspaper Attacks Were Run By CIA Mossad.
[02:22:14.037 --> 02:22:15.037]  It's a big, long article.
[02:22:15.077 --> 02:22:16.058]  My wife speaks Italian.
[02:22:16.078 --> 02:22:17.978]  We're trying to translate it all out.
[02:22:18.339 --> 02:22:20.219]  But it's pretty big news over there right now.
[02:22:20.319 --> 02:22:23.881]  Quite a few news articles about the interview he did two days ago.
[02:22:24.581 --> 02:22:30.703]  Saying it's a false flag inside job and then going through how our government staged attacks there in the 70s into 1980.
[02:22:30.863 --> 02:22:33.224]  He was the head of intelligence then later exposed that.
[02:22:33.564 --> 02:22:37.506]  Then of course he was the longest serving president in Italy where they seem to have a new one every month or two.
[02:22:37.526 --> 02:22:39.646]  He was president for seven years.
[02:22:39.806 --> 02:22:41.167]  Longest serving after Mussolini.
[02:22:41.627 --> 02:22:42.887]  That's a pretty big deal, isn't it Mike?
[02:22:43.928 --> 02:22:44.988]  Yeah, it absolutely is.
[02:22:45.088 --> 02:22:53.111]  And you also need to go back and remember that it was the Italian Parliament who investigated those forged documents about the Niger uranium sales
[02:22:53.584 --> 02:22:57.326]  to Iraq and exposed Michael Ledeen as one of the forgers.
[02:22:57.366 --> 02:22:59.568]  So they've really been kind of digging into this stuff.
[02:23:00.148 --> 02:23:06.592]  And again, in the foreign press, that 9-11 was an inside job has really been around for quite some time.
[02:23:07.092 --> 02:23:11.655]  And it's getting hard to find anybody who really still believes the official story about 9-11.
[02:23:12.971 --> 02:23:16.973]  And, you know, I know there's a lot of people who are saying, we've got to get the government to admit that they lied.
[02:23:16.993 --> 02:23:18.773]  You know, I don't need that to happen.
[02:23:19.134 --> 02:23:19.994]  I know what happened.
[02:23:20.054 --> 02:23:20.894]  You know what happened.
[02:23:20.934 --> 02:23:32.499]  If the government wants to continue marginalizing and trivializing itself by sticking to their... I've got to watch my language on this radio... but to their story about what happened on 9-11, go ahead and let them do it.
[02:23:32.519 --> 02:23:33.959]  Their credibility is already shot.
[02:23:34.300 --> 02:23:36.120]  But we know what happened on 9-11.
[02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:39.982]  We don't need the government to confirm what we already know.
[02:23:40.502 --> 02:23:41.543]  They don't matter anymore.
[02:23:41.823 --> 02:23:43.823]  We caught them in yet another lie about Iran.
[02:23:44.604 --> 02:23:47.185]  What they say about 9-11 doesn't matter anymore.
[02:23:47.285 --> 02:23:47.945]  We know the truth.
[02:23:48.145 --> 02:23:57.989]  And the key to exposing false flag terror is it takes that tool out of their arsenal of problem, reaction, solution of false flag, false inflicted, self-inflicted wounds, and it breaks it.
[02:24:00.290 --> 02:24:04.092]  It destroys that tool they've always been able to use in staging terror attacks.
[02:24:05.106 --> 02:24:06.086]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:24:06.166 --> 02:24:14.868]  And the government, it's not just terror attacks, the government is always manufacturing the enemies that we are supposed to give them money and our obedience to solve.
[02:24:14.888 --> 02:24:28.671]  Whether it's the Red Menace in the 1950s, whether it's the War on Terror, the War on Drugs, the War on Poverty, or Global Warming, it is always a case of the government creating the things that we are supposed to be afraid of and rely on the government to save us from.
[02:24:29.451 --> 02:24:30.171]  Absolutely.
[02:24:30.191 --> 02:24:33.912]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jay in Hawaii, here on the air.
[02:24:36.221 --> 02:24:40.924]  Alex, about the 1,500 trillion debt bubble crisis?
[02:24:41.324 --> 02:24:42.245]  Yes.
[02:24:42.325 --> 02:24:49.030]  The New World Order predatory system of selectively enforced regulation, I think that's what's killing America.
[02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:50.851]  Here's one example.
[02:24:51.491 --> 02:25:01.338]  I went to the state offices to try to get a permit to grow the industrial superfood hemp in my large acre backyard, and they laughed in my face every time.
[02:25:02.214 --> 02:25:03.735]  Yeah, there's no THC in it.
[02:25:03.995 --> 02:25:06.856]  It's better than cotton, better for biofuels.
[02:25:07.097 --> 02:25:09.758]  It's a magic, magic crop and we just can't have it.
[02:25:10.638 --> 02:25:14.280]  Yeah, the New World Order has killed our freedom to produce.
[02:25:15.841 --> 02:25:17.502]  I mean, I can't even get a permit to do it.
[02:25:18.212 --> 02:25:19.452]  Here's an example of that.
[02:25:19.472 --> 02:25:21.733]  I want to get Mike's take on this and I'll hold you over if you need to, Jay.
[02:25:22.593 --> 02:25:25.874]  They can't get the animal ID enforced in the Premises Society.
[02:25:25.934 --> 02:25:28.555]  When you voluntarily sign up, you waive all your rights.
[02:25:28.575 --> 02:25:32.857]  You're now under criminal regulatory control and thousands of dollars a year in premises tags.
[02:25:33.637 --> 02:25:37.818]  And they're just telling all the 4-H clubs and other clubs, you've got to have it to show your cows.
[02:25:38.118 --> 02:25:40.559]  And so everybody's signing up when it's not even a law.
[02:25:43.011 --> 02:25:52.924]  Hemp is also a super food source, and we could produce enough of it to reduce the cost of energy and food worldwide, but the New World Order won't let us do it.
[02:25:53.625 --> 02:25:55.147]  Let me get Mike's final comment on that.
[02:25:56.027 --> 02:26:17.360]  Well, basically, there's a great deal of enforcement over what products you will buy, and of course, the goal of any governmental structure is to make you not self-reliant, where you will go out and you will participate in commerce by buying what you need rather than growing what you need, because if you're growing something, if you're making something, if you're cooking something, then you're not paying for it, and there's no tax opportunity there.
[02:26:17.754 --> 02:26:20.395]  And government is so desperate for money.
[02:26:20.635 --> 02:26:28.619]  That's why they created the service economy, so they could charge us taxes while we do each other's laundry for a fee, instead of doing our own laundry and not paying the taxes on it.
[02:26:29.059 --> 02:26:38.944]  So it's not really even about the hemp anymore, it is about enforcing people to have to pay money for everything that they do in life, so that there's an opportunity for taxation occurring.
[02:26:39.684 --> 02:26:42.445]  Mike Rivera, WhatReallyHappened.com, doing a great job.
[02:26:42.485 --> 02:26:46.247]  You do a Saturday morning two-hour transmission right here.
[02:26:47.376 --> 02:26:57.584]  on the network, and we are so honored to have you here, part of the Genesis Network, and just have a good rest of the week, and bon voyage, my friend.
[02:26:58.505 --> 02:27:01.448]  Well, thank you, Alex, and thank you for all your support, and have a happy holiday.
[02:27:01.608 --> 02:27:01.988]  Thank you.
[02:27:02.028 --> 02:27:02.669]  You too, my friend.
[02:27:02.709 --> 02:27:03.649]  We'll talk to you next month.
[02:27:03.729 --> 02:27:04.830]  Michael Vero joins us once a month.
[02:27:05.191 --> 02:27:05.931]  Thank you, Jay.
[02:27:07.132 --> 02:27:07.873]  Anything else, Jay?
[02:27:08.253 --> 02:27:08.753]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27:09.234 --> 02:27:11.315]  The New World Order, that's how they get us.
[02:27:11.436 --> 02:27:15.519]  They've purchased every production company, and then they restrict everything else.
[02:27:16.289 --> 02:27:18.872]  So, because if America still had... Stay there!
[02:27:18.892 --> 02:27:20.513]  Yeah, that's mercantilism.
[02:27:21.074 --> 02:27:22.115]  Neo-mercantile.
[02:27:22.555 --> 02:27:23.236]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:29.361 --> 02:27:30.282]  We're on the march.
[02:27:30.763 --> 02:27:32.364]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:33.285 --> 02:27:35.968]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:39.022 --> 02:27:44.506]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:44.946 --> 02:27:49.169]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:56.455]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:27:56.895 --> 02:28:03.598]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:03.918 --> 02:28:05.539]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:28:05.839 --> 02:28:09.021]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:09.281 --> 02:28:11.742]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[02:28:25.972 --> 02:28:28.194]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[02:28:38.672 --> 02:28:43.614]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:28:43.934 --> 02:28:45.815]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:28:46.015 --> 02:28:49.057]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:28:49.237 --> 02:28:52.358]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:28:52.678 --> 02:28:54.519]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:28:54.799 --> 02:28:55.340]  We're good to go.
[02:29:11.235 --> 02:29:15.578]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.

[02:29:38.937 --> 02:29:43.221]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:29:43.461 --> 02:29:48.325]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:29:48.566 --> 02:29:49.887]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:29:50.067 --> 02:29:53.450]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:51.711]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:30:51.731 --> 02:30:56.294]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:30:56.794 --> 02:30:58.735]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[02:31:00.476 --> 02:31:02.256]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.

[02:33:20.340 --> 02:33:21.100]  Or the weekends, 590.
[02:33:21.720 --> 02:33:22.401]  That's just an example.
[02:33:22.421 --> 02:33:25.642]  Whatever station you have in your area, please.
[02:33:25.782 --> 02:33:27.042]  I just want to reach people.
[02:33:27.422 --> 02:33:28.503]  I just want to warn them.
[02:33:29.267 --> 02:33:30.628]  I want to stop World War III.
[02:33:30.728 --> 02:33:32.309]  I want to stop the destruction of the dollar.
[02:33:32.589 --> 02:33:33.910]  And we're having an effect.
[02:33:34.030 --> 02:33:36.052]  You are having an effect.
[02:33:36.412 --> 02:33:41.375]  Going back to Jay in Hawaii, you were making a great point about how they control the means of production.
[02:33:41.395 --> 02:33:41.735]  Go ahead.
[02:33:42.416 --> 02:33:47.859]  Yeah, the New World Order has created the predatory system of selectively enforced regulation.
[02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:51.882]  They purchase all the production companies and restrict everything else.
[02:33:52.657 --> 02:33:59.660]  And um, like you said Alex, the New World Order has created a system of wealth the size of a football field, and the world is the postage stamp.
[02:34:00.400 --> 02:34:05.342]  And right now, they're looking at the postage stamp with lust and envy, and they're licking their lips.
[02:34:05.402 --> 02:34:11.344]  And now they've already blown out the football field, now they're thinking, just go ahead and blow apart the postage stamp too.
[02:34:12.097 --> 02:34:16.198]  And if... But that's an analogy I've been using the last few days.
[02:34:16.278 --> 02:34:20.740]  It's actually, in the aggregate, bigger than a football field compared 50 by 100 yards.
[02:34:20.820 --> 02:34:21.640]  It's actually bigger than that.
[02:34:21.660 --> 02:34:25.101]  When you've got $1,500 trillion in just derivatives and our whole federal budget's $1.8
[02:34:33.744 --> 02:34:35.125]  Yeah, they created it out of nothing.
[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:02.101]  That's how they get us.
[02:35:02.221 --> 02:35:08.686]  First, they have to kill our internal production before they blow out the economy.
[02:35:08.706 --> 02:35:11.048]  And that's why they do that economically in the West.
[02:35:11.168 --> 02:35:16.452]  But the 60-something rogue nations out of the 180 nations that are on the planet or so...
[02:35:17.262 --> 02:35:18.182]  It's always fluctuating.
[02:35:18.502 --> 02:35:21.203]  New nations fall, new ones rise, you know, things change.
[02:35:21.803 --> 02:35:26.144]  But Serbia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, good, bad, and different.
[02:35:26.164 --> 02:35:27.145]  I'm not defending those governments.
[02:35:27.165 --> 02:35:46.930]  The point is they're sovereign, they have their own factories, their own industries, and the actual globalist reports, the Royal Institute of International Affairs put out reports, the Royal Commission on Population put out by the British government, 44 to 49, says we want to de-industrialize an enslaved nation so they can't challenge our global hegemony.
[02:35:47.771 --> 02:35:54.577]  Yeah, if we still had internal production, it wouldn't matter if they blew out the bubble to the size of the universe.
[02:35:55.217 --> 02:36:02.343]  They've got to kill the ability of local farmers or basically anyone to produce what they want.
[02:36:02.884 --> 02:36:06.647]  And that's what the National Premise Society and Animal ID does.
[02:36:06.947 --> 02:36:11.491]  We've gotten our own documents out of the big industries that want to shut us off.
[02:36:11.511 --> 02:36:13.213]  They say it's to knock out the family farm.
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:21.503]  Yeah, I heard you talking months ago about how you were at a meeting and there was a bunch of farmers with their guns saying, hey, you may be saying this, but I'm ready to fight with my gun.
[02:36:21.983 --> 02:36:28.586]  But, I mean, hopefully they resist if it ever comes to that, but I see all the liberals out there talking about how they hate deforestation.
[02:36:28.626 --> 02:36:31.907]  Well, hemp can also be turned into lumber.
[02:36:32.147 --> 02:36:38.569]  If our freedom to produce was restored, I mean, we could produce enough lumber for the whole world and stop deforestation, but... I hear you.
[02:36:38.609 --> 02:36:39.450]  I gotta jump.
[02:36:39.630 --> 02:36:40.430]  Good points, Jay.
[02:36:40.810 --> 02:36:42.311]  John in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[02:36:45.057 --> 02:36:46.899]  It says LA, or is that Los Angeles?
[02:36:47.499 --> 02:36:48.300]  Okay, go ahead, John.
[02:36:49.701 --> 02:37:02.092]  I wanted to see what your take was on... I mean, I've heard you talk about this plenty of times before, but, you know, the media is still trying to maintain the right-left paradigm.
[02:37:02.132 --> 02:37:08.958]  That's why they don't want Ron Paul to be able to voice his opinion, because they don't want a Republican who's anti-war and anti-Federal Reserve.
[02:37:10.470 --> 02:37:14.891]  And so they try to keep us fighting in the left and right where there's no real difference, yes.
[02:37:15.451 --> 02:37:31.974]  Yeah, so, I mean, when you're watching the debates, you know, Anderson Cooper is going to, of course, ignore, you know, Ron Paul, and they make sure that he gets the least amount of time so he doesn't get his message out.
[02:37:32.194 --> 02:37:33.074]  Every debate, yes.
[02:37:33.615 --> 02:37:34.435]  Every single debate.
[02:37:34.795 --> 02:37:35.995]  How obvious does it have to get?
[02:37:37.074 --> 02:37:38.275]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:37:38.295 --> 02:37:47.321]  I just posted on the prison planet forum an article Joseph Stiglitz.
[02:37:48.021 --> 02:37:49.662]  Yes, former chief economist, World Bank.
[02:37:50.043 --> 02:37:53.265]  Right, he just put out an article in the December issue of Vanity Fair.
[02:37:53.285 --> 02:37:53.845]  Did you see that?
[02:37:54.345 --> 02:37:54.806]  No, I didn't.
[02:37:55.546 --> 02:37:57.728]  So I just posted that up there.
[02:37:58.668 --> 02:38:02.031]  But he kind of blames the Bush administration for
[02:38:04.293 --> 02:38:05.074]  You know, economy.
[02:38:05.434 --> 02:38:06.895]  How long have you been listening to the show?
[02:38:08.216 --> 02:38:10.377]  I've been listening for four years.
[02:38:10.898 --> 02:38:15.040]  Then you've heard me over and over again say that they plan to blame Bush for it all.
[02:38:15.340 --> 02:38:16.201]  Yeah.
[02:38:16.261 --> 02:38:19.082]  And this is the global consolidation, then we would take the blame.
[02:38:19.183 --> 02:38:21.704]  I said before the war, everything was going to happen.
[02:38:22.144 --> 02:38:22.425]  Why?
[02:38:22.525 --> 02:38:24.106]  Because the globalists have stated it all.
[02:38:24.766 --> 02:38:26.227]  I mean, I'm only repeating what they said.
[02:38:26.547 --> 02:38:26.727]  Yeah.
[02:38:26.827 --> 02:38:32.991]  And so our name dies, our currency dies, our country falls apart, and then the globalists just move forward.
[02:38:33.510 --> 02:38:34.031]  Absolutely.
[02:38:34.111 --> 02:38:35.272]  Can I ask you one more question?
[02:38:35.412 --> 02:38:35.652]  Sure.
[02:38:37.995 --> 02:38:38.515]  City group.
[02:38:40.017 --> 02:38:44.181]  Yeah, they have 70 plus trillion in derivatives.
[02:38:45.343 --> 02:38:46.224]  Okay.
[02:38:47.545 --> 02:38:52.871]  Even people in our movement still seem to believe that the Rockefellers have some
[02:38:53.618 --> 02:38:55.860]  You know, monetary interest in that?
[02:38:56.060 --> 02:38:58.382]  They're going to get out clean from that collapsing.
[02:38:58.442 --> 02:38:59.142]  They want it to collapse.
[02:38:59.162 --> 02:39:02.024]  Yeah, I mean, we oversimplify when we say Rothschilds and Rockefellers.
[02:39:02.084 --> 02:39:03.125]  They are the progenitors.
[02:39:03.165 --> 02:39:04.106]  They're the big dogs.
[02:39:04.186 --> 02:39:06.888]  They're the ones that set the game 100 years ago.
[02:39:07.608 --> 02:39:19.337]  They still own large portions of it, but it's so puffed out to the millionth degree, like the last caller said, to the universe, I mean, to infinity, that it's all now just complete la-la land.
[02:39:19.857 --> 02:39:20.538]  Right, exactly.
[02:39:22.512 --> 02:39:24.814]  I would say just one more suggestion for the listeners.
[02:39:26.796 --> 02:39:30.939]  I think a good book to read is America's Great Depression by Murray Rothbard.
[02:39:32.100 --> 02:39:33.662]  I've heard that's a really informative book.
[02:39:34.162 --> 02:39:36.404]  Yeah, so anyways, I love what you do, sir.
[02:39:36.484 --> 02:39:37.145]  I appreciate you.
[02:39:37.445 --> 02:39:38.246]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:39:39.186 --> 02:39:41.668]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Adam in Boston.
[02:39:41.789 --> 02:39:43.370]  Adam, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:39:43.835 --> 02:39:44.816]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:39:44.836 --> 02:39:48.618]  Thanks for taking this call from me here.
[02:39:49.079 --> 02:39:58.125]  I just wanted to talk about some realizations I came upon when I was doing some research for this documentary I'm making called Global Warming and the Imperial Corporatocracy.
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:07.764]  As we all know, since the Major mandating a Mesopotamian area post-World War II, the British had had a serious monopoly of control when it comes to oil concession and the companies that had a stake.
[02:40:08.344 --> 02:40:12.626]  The Americans, however, had a bit of difficulty getting a piece of the action.
[02:40:12.746 --> 02:40:18.128]  Only until roughly late 40s, early 50s did the Americans manage to get a piece of the action.
[02:40:19.115 --> 02:40:32.371]  When Kassim came into power and threw out the British-controlled monarchy and it really messed up everything for the five major oil companies, they no longer had that complete monopoly on the oil concessions.
[02:40:32.791 --> 02:40:36.856]  Enter America and the installment of Hussein and the Baathist Party via America,
[02:40:37.628 --> 02:40:53.555]  British-influenced big companies had to start looking somewhere else for oil concessions, but the Americans realized that if they can keep all the oil bought and sold in the dollar, they can maintain a different kind of monopoly.
[02:40:53.895 --> 02:40:57.876]  A monopoly that British interests didn't have access to because of their currency.
[02:40:57.956 --> 02:40:59.197]  Yeah, but the British and U.S.
[02:40:59.277 --> 02:41:00.157]  interests are inseparable.
[02:41:00.177 --> 02:41:01.398]  It's not the Bretton Woods Agreement.
[02:41:01.818 --> 02:41:02.438]  I know, I know.
[02:41:02.678 --> 02:41:15.901]  Traditionally thinking, we do look at it as inseparable, but at the same time, when you look further on, you can actually see almost like there's a rivalry here as far as who's going to have a majority of the power in the 21st century coming up here.
[02:41:15.961 --> 02:41:17.141]  Yeah, they're joined at the hip.
[02:41:17.201 --> 02:41:17.961]  It's the U.S.
[02:41:18.022 --> 02:41:23.403]  and England elites against the people against the world, and then you've got a few other power blocs, but they're all infiltrated.
[02:41:23.983 --> 02:41:24.803]  What are you reading from?
[02:41:25.373 --> 02:41:26.454]  Uh, what am I reading from?
[02:41:26.494 --> 02:41:31.276]  This is, uh, as far as what am I reading from right now, I, I did a little transcript for this, uh, call.
[02:41:31.296 --> 02:41:31.856]  I got away.
[02:41:31.896 --> 02:41:32.477]  I didn't stumble.
[02:41:32.797 --> 02:41:38.800]  But as far as what the information, the depth, the, uh, the information that I'm getting this from, it's a, it's a, it's a bunch of different.
[02:41:38.820 --> 02:41:40.240]  Well, no, I mean, that's accurate info.
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:40.921]  I'm just, okay.
[02:41:41.161 --> 02:41:41.961]  Let me just go ahead.
[02:41:42.381 --> 02:41:42.702]  Okay.
[02:41:42.742 --> 02:41:51.606]  So essentially, so after America, we installed Hussein and, uh, all the other companies started having to look elsewhere for the oil.
[02:41:52.972 --> 02:41:59.214]  So the British wasn't able to create the monopoly that America has now, via the currency control of the oil.
[02:41:59.734 --> 02:42:11.118]  And this is why America has a big stake in Mesopotamia in modern times, and why in 1990 we went physically into Iraq, because he wanted to switch to the Euro, thus threatening our international dollar hegemony.
[02:42:11.638 --> 02:42:15.659]  A lot of us know this, and a lot of us don't really... You've got that mixed up.
[02:42:15.739 --> 02:42:17.580]  I'm going to let you go.
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:18.420]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:19.861]  I just can't let you read a book on air.
[02:42:21.707 --> 02:42:23.027]  You got that a little bit wrong there.
[02:42:23.047 --> 02:42:25.688]  But it's interesting, and a lot of it's accurate.
[02:42:25.708 --> 02:42:27.669]  None of this is debated.
[02:42:27.709 --> 02:42:28.989]  This is all just public knowledge.
[02:42:29.909 --> 02:42:32.670]  Saddam was talking about switching to the Euro in 2004.
[02:42:33.331 --> 02:42:39.392]  In 2002 and 2003 he was talking about it, as much as the world has been doing.
[02:42:39.892 --> 02:42:43.554]  And so part of the reason to go in was to control and dominate oil interest.
[02:42:43.914 --> 02:42:48.715]  But you have the Anglo-American establishment really joined together in that.
[02:42:48.835 --> 02:42:51.376]  And then it's pretty much inseparable from Europe as well.
[02:42:52.414 --> 02:42:54.977]  So, Saddam Hussein was installed by our government.
[02:42:55.317 --> 02:43:00.903]  He was over-pumping in 1990, according to OPEC, and driving down prices to $0.85, $0.90 a gallon for 87 octane.
[02:43:04.807 --> 02:43:06.749]  And that's why they got upset in the media.
[02:43:07.169 --> 02:43:08.750]  That's why the culture got upset.
[02:43:08.770 --> 02:43:12.653]  That's why the monopoly culture got mad.
[02:43:13.153 --> 02:43:18.638]  Saddam was trying to pay off his international loans that he'd been financed and given to invade Iran, attack Iran.
[02:43:18.898 --> 02:43:21.400]  Over a million-plus people died in that eight-year war.
[02:43:21.420 --> 02:43:24.062]  So you've just got some of your dates mixed up there, Bubba.
[02:43:24.842 --> 02:43:26.804]  Let's go ahead and talk to Aaron in New York.
[02:43:26.824 --> 02:43:27.604]  Aaron, go ahead.
[02:43:29.926 --> 02:43:30.226]  Hello?
[02:43:30.427 --> 02:43:30.907]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:43:31.594 --> 02:43:33.056]  Hi Alex, this is Aaron.
[02:43:44.983 --> 02:43:46.124]  Yes, we're good to go!
[02:44:14.176 --> 02:44:14.717]  It's literally a red pill.
[02:44:14.737 --> 02:44:16.698]  If somebody will just take the red pill, if you'll just look on your own.
[02:44:16.718 --> 02:44:17.579]  Don't believe me.
[02:44:17.599 --> 02:44:18.920]  If you just look into it yourself.
[02:44:18.940 --> 02:44:22.744]  Now the government is trying to put out a background of kooks and nuts and Bigfoot and chupacabras.
[02:44:22.764 --> 02:44:23.584]  We're not doing that.
[02:44:23.604 --> 02:44:24.705]  We're covering real issues.
[02:44:40.515 --> 02:44:41.518]  Yep, exactly.
[02:44:41.538 --> 02:44:47.534]  So that's where, you know, I guess this is going along the lines of trying to, you know, get other people to take the red pill and
[02:44:48.334 --> 02:44:48.854]  I don't think so.
[02:45:12.936 --> 02:45:14.298]  I'm glad you know it's there.
[02:45:29.522 --> 02:45:30.563]  Well, they also misrepresent
[02:45:59.026 --> 02:46:00.146]  They build strong men.
[02:46:00.306 --> 02:46:01.427]  And look, they took the video.
[02:46:01.887 --> 02:46:06.008]  They shot here for days, shot there for days, and then they just put a few minutes of us in.
[02:46:06.288 --> 02:46:10.390]  And they would take the video, blow out the color correction where my skin looked like I have hepatitis.
[02:46:11.250 --> 02:46:12.350]  I don't have hepatitis, folks.
[02:46:12.370 --> 02:46:13.371]  People always mistake what I say.
[02:46:13.431 --> 02:46:14.871]  It looks like I did yellow skin.
[02:46:15.631 --> 02:46:20.793]  They would take the video and stretch it out so that my head looked like 100 pounds heavier.
[02:46:21.153 --> 02:46:23.874]  They did that to Dylan where he looked like some kind of white flounder.
[02:46:24.574 --> 02:46:27.115]  And I mean, they pulled out every trick in the book on that.
[02:46:29.074 --> 02:46:33.457]  Exactly, and I guess I have a couple things I want to try and cover here.
[02:46:33.597 --> 02:46:34.958]  Real fast, we're almost out of time.
[02:46:35.178 --> 02:46:37.119]  Okay, real quick, I'll get to this last one here.
[02:46:37.519 --> 02:46:56.370]  I was just on the Ron Paul website noticing that it looks like any purchases that you make through the store count as contributions, and I know we're trying to do this run-up for the Tea Party that I'm definitely in for, and I don't know if it's a good suggestion for people if those purchases do count as contributions and will work towards that $10 million goal we're trying to get.
[02:46:57.214 --> 02:47:07.142]  Whether it actually makes sense to give people, not just to give cash, but maybe to actually, you know, don't buy Chinese, go and get somebody a book or buy t-shirts or stuff like that for Christmas or any other way.
[02:47:07.162 --> 02:47:07.823]  No, I agree.
[02:47:08.323 --> 02:47:14.669]  Go to the Ron Paul campaign on the 16th coming up on the Money Bomb Day and buy a bunch of t-shirts and bumper stickers and signs.
[02:47:14.709 --> 02:47:15.549]  They sell at cost.
[02:47:16.010 --> 02:47:16.830]  Buy a bunch of them.
[02:47:16.850 --> 02:47:21.814]  That way then you get to double, give money to Ron Paul and spread the word with the t-shirts.
[02:47:22.195 --> 02:47:25.658]  Yeah, because I'm thinking, I guess at a certain point, I mean, how much money can they spend on
[02:47:26.570 --> 02:47:27.453]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:47:32.663 --> 02:47:40.747]  Um, and really spread the word directly, because you know no matter what, even if it gets to 10 million, they're going to cover it for 30 seconds on the news, and that's it, and you're never going to hear about it ever again.
[02:47:41.188 --> 02:47:47.271]  But if you start taking the message on a viral basis, and just go one-on-one, you can really get... Well, I think we should do it all.
[02:47:47.311 --> 02:47:50.473]  We should shoot for the mainstream, but also the viral alternative growing media.
[02:47:50.873 --> 02:47:53.654]  I mean, he was on The View for like 15 minutes this morning, or longer.
[02:47:53.674 --> 02:47:54.515]  I didn't watch it all.
[02:47:54.535 --> 02:47:57.036]  It's going up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:47:57.056 --> 02:47:58.497]  Aaron's just finished uploading it.
[02:47:59.618 --> 02:48:00.799]  All this other stuff's happening.
[02:48:00.819 --> 02:48:02.240]  He was on Jay Leno Show.
[02:48:02.260 --> 02:48:09.827]  The money bomb did make him break out and did make the media force, and his poll numbers doubled, by the way, in Iowa and New Hampshire from that.
[02:48:09.867 --> 02:48:12.429]  So this money bomb on the 16th could double the numbers again.
[02:48:12.449 --> 02:48:13.690]  I appreciate your call.
[02:48:16.192 --> 02:48:18.974]  Several other news items I wanted to hit, but I also want to talk to Chris in Florida.
[02:48:19.014 --> 02:48:22.637]  We'll probably have time for him, but I've got a few news items in the final segment.
[02:48:23.017 --> 02:48:28.381]  Boy, that transmission went by fast, but if you missed the first hour, I get into Ron Paul, some new developments there.
[02:48:28.441 --> 02:48:37.068]  I get into an interview with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts about the economy and where it's going, and that's going to be restarting in about eight minutes at InfoWars.com if you're listening to the streams.
[02:48:39.249 --> 02:48:42.732]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[02:48:43.462 --> 02:48:48.646]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:48.686 --> 02:48:50.528]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:51.168 --> 02:48:53.430]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:48:53.991 --> 02:48:56.413]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:48:57.153 --> 02:49:04.499]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:07.489 --> 02:49:12.512]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:12.973 --> 02:49:16.435]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:16.815 --> 02:49:19.337]  Bill Burdick is making great progress in the New World Order.
[02:49:19.377 --> 02:49:20.538]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:20.558 --> 02:49:21.318]  They're not after money.
[02:49:21.338 --> 02:49:22.399]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:22.599 --> 02:49:23.340]  They're after power.
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:24.621]  That's what they're after.
[02:49:24.741 --> 02:49:29.304]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:49:29.504 --> 02:49:32.926]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:33.486 --> 02:49:35.728]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:49:36.248 --> 02:49:37.429]  You have been warned.
[02:49:39.910 --> 02:49:51.197]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[02:49:51.377 --> 02:49:57.841]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[02:49:58.081 --> 02:49:58.681]  We're good to go!
[02:50:22.637 --> 02:50:24.878]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[02:50:25.018 --> 02:50:25.658]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[02:50:47.950 --> 02:50:52.393]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[02:50:52.733 --> 02:50:54.835]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[02:50:55.195 --> 02:50:56.236]  They keep you down.
[02:50:56.436 --> 02:50:57.356]  They keep you blue.
[02:50:57.636 --> 02:51:00.538]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[02:51:02.560 --> 02:51:04.661]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[02:51:05.021 --> 02:51:10.405]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[02:51:12.285 --> 02:51:16.846]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[02:51:16.866 --> 02:51:20.527]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:51:21.708 --> 02:51:26.589]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[02:51:26.649 --> 02:51:30.890]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:51:31.150 --> 02:51:33.291]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[02:51:33.371 --> 02:51:34.171]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:51:47.432 --> 02:51:49.193]  They laid their bodies down!
[02:51:49.213 --> 02:51:51.134]  In a bloody war!
[02:51:51.194 --> 02:51:51.734]  For liberty!
[02:51:51.814 --> 02:51:51.994]  For us!
[02:51:52.054 --> 02:51:55.656]  And I will not forget that debt I owe.
[02:51:55.736 --> 02:51:57.256]  We've got some freedom today.
[02:52:16.508 --> 02:52:19.229]  Alright, in the news.
[02:52:19.929 --> 02:52:26.171]  Steve Watts sent in an article, Dear Diluted Mass Media, North American Union Agenda Exist.
[02:52:27.051 --> 02:52:33.033]  And it's got the clips of CNN saying there's no trans-Texas corridor, and then the actual official government maps.
[02:52:33.393 --> 02:52:33.894]  They're building it.
[02:52:33.934 --> 02:52:34.794]  It's on our news here.
[02:52:35.074 --> 02:52:37.315]  But they know both people don't live in Texas, so they can just lie.
[02:52:37.895 --> 02:52:39.295]  And it goes through a bunch of other key stuff.
[02:52:39.355 --> 02:52:40.796]  That's up on Infowars.net.
[02:52:40.816 --> 02:52:41.276]  I hope you go.
[02:52:42.102 --> 02:52:42.763]  I meant to get into it.
[02:52:42.783 --> 02:52:45.045]  It's called the Ron Paul Clips, the maps, the documents.
[02:52:45.105 --> 02:52:45.966]  It's really a treatise.
[02:52:46.526 --> 02:52:48.308]  This type of great work needs to be seen.
[02:52:48.388 --> 02:52:49.589]  I know you know it's real.
[02:52:49.669 --> 02:52:51.010]  I know you saw the documents.
[02:52:51.390 --> 02:52:54.313]  I know you've seen Endgame or read the Late Great USA.
[02:52:54.854 --> 02:52:56.335]  But your neighbors haven't, folks.
[02:52:56.375 --> 02:52:57.876]  That's why you need to get Endgame.
[02:52:58.116 --> 02:52:58.977]  You need to get Late Great USA.
[02:52:59.338 --> 02:53:01.159]  You can get them both discounted, by the way.
[02:53:01.179 --> 02:53:02.661]  It's something like $28 in stores.
[02:53:02.681 --> 02:53:05.103]  $19.95 for Late Great USA.
[02:53:05.143 --> 02:53:05.883]  We have it in stock.
[02:53:07.125 --> 02:53:08.546]  You need to go there and get Endgame.
[02:53:09.571 --> 02:53:10.671]  And show it to people.
[02:53:10.811 --> 02:53:12.632]  Give it to them and say, here's the North American Union.
[02:53:12.912 --> 02:53:13.932]  Tell me what you think of this.
[02:53:13.952 --> 02:53:18.414]  You know, don't push it on them as political information because they may not watch it and go, hey, this is a wild movie.
[02:53:18.634 --> 02:53:19.474]  Tell me what you think of it.
[02:53:19.894 --> 02:53:20.814]  Give in-game.
[02:53:20.854 --> 02:53:22.255]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:22.295 --> 02:53:26.756]  Take advantage of the year-end special we do every year.
[02:53:26.776 --> 02:53:28.116]  5.3 months free.
[02:53:28.557 --> 02:53:30.837]  Almost half a year free when you sign up for a year.
[02:53:31.097 --> 02:53:36.839]  You pay for six months, roughly, a little more than six months, less than seven months, and you get
[02:53:39.201 --> 02:53:41.581]  Well, it's just a great deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:42.542 --> 02:53:43.162]  It's a great deal.
[02:53:43.542 --> 02:53:45.642]  So check out details at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:46.122 --> 02:53:49.283]  The other news is, like, a deaf guy, they went to the police and put him in the wrong house.
[02:53:49.303 --> 02:53:50.263]  He was in the bathtub.
[02:53:50.583 --> 02:53:52.303]  He said, I can't hear you, and they tasered him.
[02:53:52.643 --> 02:53:55.504]  I mean, now, if you do anything, they just taser you.
[02:53:56.804 --> 02:54:00.865]  We've got the drug czar, the federal drug czar, saying he wants to drug test kids nationwide.
[02:54:02.245 --> 02:54:04.465]  We've got just all this news.
[02:54:04.565 --> 02:54:07.206]  And, of course, the big news of the day, I never even read the whole article on air,
[02:54:07.975 --> 02:54:15.157]  Former Italian President, one of the most respected, longest serving, intel agencies know 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:54:15.197 --> 02:54:19.998]  Man who blew the whistle on Gladio tells Italy's largest newspaper attacks were run by CIA massacre.
[02:54:20.538 --> 02:54:22.039]  That is scary stuff.
[02:54:22.579 --> 02:54:24.059]  More and more of it is coming out.
[02:54:24.980 --> 02:54:27.220]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Florida.
[02:54:27.260 --> 02:54:28.101]  Chris, thanks for holding.
[02:54:28.121 --> 02:54:29.161]  You're our tail gunner today.
[02:54:29.201 --> 02:54:29.541]  Go ahead.
[02:54:30.345 --> 02:54:34.168]  You say that a lot of the big money is leaving the country and going to other countries.
[02:54:34.428 --> 02:54:37.311]  Do you know what kind of nations they're going to in general?
[02:54:37.651 --> 02:54:38.592]  Now you have to understand.
[02:54:38.852 --> 02:54:39.512]  Yeah, well sure.
[02:54:39.572 --> 02:54:42.134]  I mean, my sister went to a fancy private school.
[02:54:42.194 --> 02:54:43.055]  I went to public school.
[02:54:43.095 --> 02:54:44.496]  But my parents said, well that was a mistake.
[02:54:44.536 --> 02:54:45.517]  Let's send her to private school.
[02:54:45.557 --> 02:54:49.000]  So, I mean, I've been to picnics back when she was little.
[02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:51.062]  She's 15 years younger than George Bush was at.
[02:54:51.602 --> 02:54:53.243]  So, you know, his daughter went to Austin High.
[02:54:53.263 --> 02:54:55.985]  But before that, they went to St.
[02:54:56.066 --> 02:54:56.466]  Andrews.
[02:54:56.526 --> 02:54:57.727]  It's the best school here in Austin.
[02:54:58.453 --> 02:54:58.854]  That's right.
[02:55:17.152 --> 02:55:19.794]  And I don't want to get too much into it.
[02:55:19.814 --> 02:55:20.815]  The point is, it's private.
[02:55:21.375 --> 02:55:25.798]  And they didn't tell me too much, but I'm media, and they didn't buy any attorney-client stuff.
[02:55:25.818 --> 02:55:31.381]  But the point is, and I've also seen in the news they're leaving, they're going to New Zealand.
[02:55:31.441 --> 02:55:32.442]  They're going to Switzerland.
[02:55:32.462 --> 02:55:33.403]  They're going to Spain.
[02:55:34.563 --> 02:55:35.884]  They're just getting out of the U.S.
[02:55:35.904 --> 02:55:37.125]  They're buying private islands.
[02:55:38.326 --> 02:55:42.749]  I haven't seen any going to Ireland, but I've heard that's pretty nice.
[02:55:44.590 --> 02:55:46.071]  But anything else, sir?
[02:55:47.629 --> 02:55:59.675]  Well, on a lighter note, I kind of find it funny every time you mention that when a light shines on the cockroaches that they start to fornicate as if they're being sprayed with pesticide.
[02:56:00.075 --> 02:56:04.617]  I get the image of cockroaches in a brothel in stilettos.
[02:56:05.422 --> 02:56:06.603]  I'm out of here, my brother!
[02:56:06.643 --> 02:56:07.363]  God bless you all!
[02:56:07.423 --> 02:56:09.064]  Transmission restarts right now at InfoWars.com!
