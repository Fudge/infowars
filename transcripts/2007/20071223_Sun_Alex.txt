[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:00.670]  Oh, what?
[00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:09.920]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.820]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:16.161]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:18.942]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:19.022 --> 00:00:22.303]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:26.724]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.606 --> 00:00:37.326]  Welcome, welcome my friends.
[00:00:37.406 --> 00:00:43.948]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday evening, the 25th day of November 2007.
[00:00:44.028 --> 00:00:48.249]  We'll be here live for the next two hours.
[00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:51.130]  We're going to have wide open phones in both hours.
[00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.071]  I'm going to re-air an excerpt of a very important interview I did with Congressman Ron Paul Wednesday.
[00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:07.206]  Coming up in the third hour, the dark horse racing up the poll charts and breaking fundraiser records.
[00:01:08.106 --> 00:01:23.495]  We'll be talking to him about the police state move here in the United States to, we have White House memos and now we can see the talking points being put into operation by CNN, Fox and others, that those that question the war are actually working for Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:24.392 --> 00:01:24.692]  I don't know.
[00:01:37.336 --> 00:01:39.939]  In this first hour, here's just some of the news I have in front of me.
[00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:44.284]  The dollar drops to record lows again against the euro.
[00:01:44.324 --> 00:01:49.710]  Dollar drops a record low against the euro amid speculation of another Federal Reserve rate cut.
[00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:52.894]  Also, cell phone tracking powers on request.
[00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:55.737]  Secret warrants ground up without probable cause.
[00:01:55.757 --> 00:01:56.919]  That's the Washington Post.
[00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:58.460]  End of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:08.148]  The feds are also not just recruiting the police to be little secret federal agents and setting up CIA offices in major cities across the country to fight not just terror, but also crime.
[00:02:08.808 --> 00:02:13.692]  They are also, in the name of fighting crime, of course, keeping us all safe, just like the Fuhrer did.
[00:02:14.073 --> 00:02:16.635]  They're also recruiting firefighters to spy on you.
[00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:20.278]  And I love firefighters, firefighting men and women, and the great job they do.
[00:02:20.298 --> 00:02:22.940]  And it's sad to see them being brought into this system.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.262]  Also, riot police arrest 150, a new anti-Putin demonstration.
[00:02:28.602 --> 00:02:34.405]  Demonstrations aren't allowed in Russia if you're against the government's policies, just like in many areas of the U.S.
[00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:35.285]  they're not allowed now.
[00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:40.127]  So I thought I'd illustrate that police state development over there, and how it mirrors with this nation.
[00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:52.692]  And the Houston Chronicle, as well as Houston television stations, KPRC, reported that they have, quote, secret drones surveilling the city, and the police department got very upset when the population learned
[00:02:53.132 --> 00:02:55.193]  of the secret drone operation.
[00:02:56.034 --> 00:03:10.083]  Vanity Fair has been sued in the US by a German organization, saying that they're not allowed to interview white supremacists, that that violates European laws.
[00:03:10.503 --> 00:03:12.524]  They're trying to bring US laws under it.
[00:03:12.564 --> 00:03:15.446]  Now, the article was against the white supremacists.
[00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:17.630]  I'm against them as well.
[00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.774]  But I have to say that this is a Hitlerian tactic to try to restrict free speech, but this is international law spilling over here.
[00:03:27.214 --> 00:03:30.615]  France is trying to use their laws against the Internet here in the U.S.
[00:03:30.956 --> 00:03:32.336]  and try to restrict the Internet.
[00:03:32.736 --> 00:03:34.457]  Because it is global, that may happen.
[00:03:34.897 --> 00:03:37.518]  This is all very serious attacks on the First Amendment.
[00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:45.542]  You know, toothless Klan members have a right to say whatever they want, as long as they don't hurt anybody, and I have a right to say they're toothless.
[00:03:46.383 --> 00:03:51.210]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, this is all part of restricting free speech.
[00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.138]  It has nothing to do with keeping you safe from all of the evil, wicked extremists that are out there.
[00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:02.323]  Also, the United Nations this week came out and said the ocean is dying.
[00:04:02.483 --> 00:04:04.644]  Only a global government can save you from that.
[00:04:05.004 --> 00:04:09.426]  I thought we'd look at their fear-mongering and integrate it in with another story here.
[00:04:09.586 --> 00:04:10.686]  Desperate measures.
[00:04:11.426 --> 00:04:14.488]  Women getting sterilized to save the earth.
[00:04:14.508 --> 00:04:17.749]  This is all part of the larger global population reduction push.
[00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:18.670]  We're good to go.
[00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:47.189]  And I thought I'd get into this whole mindset, this love of death and destruction that permeates not just Marilyn Manson, but the elite themselves.
[00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:58.614]  So we'll tell you what, women having themselves sterilized, the UN pushing for global government in the name of the earth, and Marilyn Manson with the child skeletons and more, how that all ties in together.
[00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:18.911]  Also, Hillary Clinton's getting a lot of heat, as Democrats learned that Fox News' Roger Ailes has been strategizing for her for five years, and that there have been a string of secretly arranged and publicly arranged huge fundraisers by Rupert Murdoch, who's given two-to-one to Hillary, as well as defense contractors and the Republican elite.
[00:05:19.232 --> 00:05:19.672]  That's right.
[00:05:19.692 --> 00:05:22.074]  They don't intend on any other Republican actually winning.
[00:05:22.674 --> 00:05:24.415]  Hillary is the aide to camp.
[00:05:24.475 --> 00:05:25.676]  She is the aide to come.
[00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:27.737]  She is the one they plan to install.
[00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:40.284]  Bush has been installing top former Clinton officials in the State Department and the Defense Department openly saying they're preparing for a passing of the baton to Herr Hitler.
[00:05:41.565 --> 00:05:42.646]  And I will be called a liberal.
[00:05:42.686 --> 00:05:45.567]  In fact, it's already starting because I'm against Hillary.
[00:05:45.627 --> 00:05:46.548]  I'm against gun control.
[00:05:46.588 --> 00:05:47.188]  I'm now liberal.
[00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:48.589]  I'm against open borders.
[00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:49.350]  I'm now liberal.
[00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.352]  This is the full taking over of the Republican Party
[00:05:53.972 --> 00:06:09.799]  Towards the tripling of government and total socialism and the destruction of our liberties and freedoms with a gaggle of mindless fake conservatives that just want to say they're Republican and festoon their vehicles with Republican bumper stickers but actually don't want to defend this Republic.
[00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:12.840]  So we'll be going over that too.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.462]  But when we start the next segment I really want to talk just straight to you the listeners.
[00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:44.476]  I know we have millions of listeners that tune in on a weekly basis for the six days a week that I do, Monday through Friday and then of course Sundays, with this condensed two-hour transmission on Sundays, that I'm begging you as listeners out there to take a challenge, and I'm giving you a challenge, to not believe the claims I make and to not believe the things I say.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.102]  And to actually go research the claims I make for yourself.
[00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:55.728]  It's quite easy to do with the advent of search engines and, well, even your public library is the kind of old school Google type system.
[00:06:56.069 --> 00:07:01.273]  Or for reporters out there with an even better system, the LexisNexis database out of Dallas.
[00:07:02.967 --> 00:07:09.649]  I know a lot of you have checked out what I have to say over the years, or you didn't check it out, but you saw everything I predicted come to pass, unfortunately.
[00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:10.649]  I wish I wasn't right.
[00:07:11.549 --> 00:07:24.493]  But for those of you, which are a sizable minority, but nonetheless millions, who have heard what I have to say and are out of hand, discounted, out of hand, say, oh, he exaggerates, or he lies, or he makes this stuff up.
[00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:35.731]  When I get up on air and I say that Bayer Pharmaceutical knowingly allowed AIDS virus for over 10 years in their factor VIII for hemophiliacs, knowing it would kill them,
[00:07:36.448 --> 00:07:37.769]  I've been saying that for four years.
[00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:39.250]  It's been in mainstream news, by the way.
[00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.351]  Do you think they wouldn't sue me if it wasn't true?
[00:07:43.232 --> 00:08:02.221]  Or, when I say that Prince Philip wrote a book about how he wants 80% of us to die, or UT professor Eric Pianka talked about how he wants 90% of us to die, or if I talk about the United Nations' own documents saying they want to exterminate 80% of us, and I report on those documents, I mean, I would be discredited.
[00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:03.242]  I would be debunked.
[00:08:03.931 --> 00:08:06.752]  The only thing the system can do to me is build straw men.
[00:08:07.932 --> 00:08:08.953]  They don't attack the man.
[00:08:09.013 --> 00:08:10.353]  They don't attack the ideas.
[00:08:10.693 --> 00:08:22.057]  They simply report things I didn't say, build straw men that are not me, that are not my ideas, or others' ideas, along similar lines, and then they attack those straw men.
[00:08:22.898 --> 00:08:25.578]  And that is the type of rigged game they play.
[00:08:27.099 --> 00:08:29.820]  But I do want you to listen to me very, very carefully.
[00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:44.747]  I cannot even articulate, I cannot in words express just how systemic and deep and deepening and accelerating this fall into hardcore corruption is right now.
[00:08:45.988 --> 00:08:52.991]  I'm begging you to look into it because if you stand up against corruption and get involved, even in small ways, it will reverse.
[00:08:53.031 --> 00:08:55.292]  It will first stop the trend, it attracts
[00:08:55.896 --> 00:09:01.979]  And then it will begin eroding and pushing it back the other way towards more liberty, more transparency, more freedom.
[00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:17.886]  And when we get back, I want to just briefly paint the picture for you of where our country's come from and where it's going and some of the key trends in the development of something far more serious than just the term police state.
[00:09:19.196 --> 00:09:19.757]  My friends.
[00:09:20.257 --> 00:09:22.398]  So we will break that down when we get back.
[00:09:22.418 --> 00:09:23.359]  We'll take phone calls.
[00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:29.623]  Then I will blast through all the news, the extinctionists, the anti-humanists, all of it.
[00:09:30.104 --> 00:09:31.285]  They call themselves the humanists.
[00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:32.505]  They're really the anti-humanists.
[00:09:33.086 --> 00:09:37.008]  It is all coming up in the next hour and 45 minutes.
[00:09:37.028 --> 00:09:44.394]  So whether you're listening to us in Los Angeles or Austin, Texas or Knoxville, Tennessee or upstate New York, they'll be right back.
[00:09:44.414 --> 00:09:44.814]  Stay with us.
[00:09:55.409 --> 00:09:56.789]  It is a big idea.
[00:09:56.809 --> 00:09:59.630]  It is a big idea.
[00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.751]  A new world order.
[00:10:02.471 --> 00:10:06.512]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:10:06.612 --> 00:10:10.153]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:12.433]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:10:12.973 --> 00:10:15.394]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:23.575]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:10:26.497 --> 00:10:31.461]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:35.383]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:10:35.823 --> 00:10:38.324]  Bill of Rights is making great progress in the New World Order.
[00:10:38.384 --> 00:10:39.524]  Most people have no idea.
[00:10:39.544 --> 00:10:40.325]  They're not after money.
[00:10:40.345 --> 00:10:41.405]  They have all the money they need.
[00:10:41.605 --> 00:10:42.346]  They're after power.
[00:10:42.586 --> 00:10:43.726]  That's what they're after, you see.
[00:10:43.746 --> 00:10:51.930]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.871]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:10:55.271 --> 00:10:56.412]  You have been warned.
[00:10:57.046 --> 00:10:58.588]  Ted Anderson for Midas, December 21st, 2007.
[00:10:58.649 --> 00:10:58.869]  Gold 809.90.
[00:10:58.909 --> 00:11:01.412]  Old school coins can be purchased for $834.26, $411.15 for half, $205.58 per quarter.
[00:11:01.432 --> 00:11:01.893]  That's $834.26, $411.15, and $205.58.
[00:11:10.842 --> 00:11:14.123]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[00:11:14.443 --> 00:11:18.645]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[00:11:19.005 --> 00:11:22.986]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[00:11:23.367 --> 00:11:25.187]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[00:11:25.687 --> 00:11:27.388]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[00:11:27.668 --> 00:11:33.653]  The ideas of strong currency ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[00:11:33.933 --> 00:11:40.719]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:44.401]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[00:11:44.962 --> 00:11:45.843]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:11:48.405 --> 00:11:51.487]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[00:11:51.627 --> 00:11:51.948]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:11:52.008 --> 00:11:53.409]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[00:11:58.152 --> 00:11:58.693]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:11:59.033 --> 00:12:04.542]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[00:12:05.163 --> 00:12:10.892]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[00:12:11.642 --> 00:12:14.903]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[00:12:15.543 --> 00:12:18.824]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[00:12:19.444 --> 00:12:22.825]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy, and foolish.
[00:12:23.426 --> 00:12:27.927]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:30.628]  We will still have two regrets.
[00:12:31.288 --> 00:12:34.629]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[00:12:35.289 --> 00:12:38.150]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[00:12:38.945 --> 00:12:45.814]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[00:12:45.834 --> 00:12:46.835]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:12:46.876 --> 00:12:47.977]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:12:47.997 --> 00:12:48.037]  800-409-5633.
[00:12:57.336 --> 00:12:57.977]  It's a fact.
[00:12:58.217 --> 00:13:05.683]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:13:05.803 --> 00:13:14.670]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:25.478]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:31.800]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:37.042]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:13:37.222 --> 00:13:41.703]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:43.664]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:13:43.724 --> 00:13:43.984]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:13:44.004 --> 00:13:44.584]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:13:44.624 --> 00:13:46.345]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:13:53.607 --> 00:13:56.109]  We're back live.
[00:13:56.209 --> 00:14:00.312]  Thank you again for joining us.
[00:14:00.512 --> 00:14:02.713]  I hope you had a great holiday.
[00:14:20.265 --> 00:14:22.547]  Extended weekend with Thanksgiving.
[00:14:22.787 --> 00:14:27.310]  Hope you're driving safely out there across much of the nation.
[00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.571]  And your flights are going well for you.
[00:14:30.111 --> 00:14:36.015]  Thanks to our gracious emperor that opened up a lot of controlled airspace for our aircraft to maneuver through.
[00:14:37.576 --> 00:14:38.437]  All right.
[00:14:38.797 --> 00:14:41.919]  Really, most people have been robbed of history.
[00:14:41.979 --> 00:14:43.580]  It's not really taught in schools anymore.
[00:14:44.432 --> 00:15:01.443]  But throughout history, tyrants and despots and corrupt establishments have come into power and they've had lots of different sales policies and propaganda packages to sell the public on giving up their liberties and freedoms so the elite can expand their power and control.
[00:15:02.843 --> 00:15:11.729]  And can, more often than not, mobilize those captured populations to go out and wage wars across the planet or against their neighbors for them.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:19.023]  And throughout history, when corrupt governments start hiring mercenaries, even in foreign wars, it's bad enough.
[00:15:19.063 --> 00:15:28.867]  But the big no-no, even inside the corrupt Roman Empire, you were not allowed to use the mercenaries inside Rome or inside Italy.
[00:15:30.128 --> 00:15:38.892]  Hitler didn't dare bring in foreign mercenaries or domestic mercenaries against his domestic population, but now in the US we do.
[00:15:39.577 --> 00:15:53.866]  And there's so many thousands of examples of how we're going down this road, how first they claim that they're not going to have warrants to listen to Al-Qaeda, and then, oh by the way, we're going to use it for all crimes against all citizens, no more Fourth Amendment.
[00:15:54.226 --> 00:15:55.887]  You see, who watches the watchers?
[00:15:57.028 --> 00:15:58.389]  You're going to have a free society.
[00:15:58.409 --> 00:15:59.930]  You've got to have a law and order.
[00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.251]  You've got to have due process of law.
[00:16:02.291 --> 00:16:04.593]  You've got to be innocent until proven guilty.
[00:16:05.971 --> 00:16:09.494]  And all of those basic canons are being removed.
[00:16:09.554 --> 00:16:12.237]  They're being dismantled.
[00:16:13.037 --> 00:16:32.655]  But here's one example of literally thousands of just textbook examples of not just our Bill of Rights and Constitution, one of the strongest, if not the strongest, systems of government that was pro-liberty and pro-freedom and pro-individual and pro-justice.
[00:16:34.082 --> 00:16:45.753]  But even in Pinochet's Chile, or Hitler's Germany, or Mao Zedong's China, we did not see these classical expressions of hardcore tyranny.
[00:16:47.355 --> 00:16:48.296]  Let me give you just one.
[00:16:50.649 --> 00:16:59.997]  Pocket Army, Smedley Butler, Brigadier Marine Corps General, in line to be the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and then the Prescott Bush, grandfather of the President, and others.
[00:17:00.017 --> 00:17:04.241]  This was in the McCormick-Dickstein Committee hearings back in the 40s.
[00:17:04.781 --> 00:17:07.984]  They approached them and said, listen, we don't want to go to war with Germany.
[00:17:08.424 --> 00:17:15.551]  We're going to overthrow the government and set up a fascist dictatorship, and we want the Marine Corps to be the front of the spear.
[00:17:15.831 --> 00:17:17.492]  Butler had overthrown more than 15 countries.
[00:17:18.573 --> 00:17:20.774]  For the U.S., Guatemala, and countless others.
[00:17:21.575 --> 00:17:24.256]  And they came to him and said, we want you to overthrow America now.
[00:17:25.057 --> 00:17:28.599]  And the Marine Corps Commandant has now retired.
[00:17:28.639 --> 00:17:29.799]  You're next in line for that.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.200]  On the list.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:41.646]  And we want you to become the Commandant and we're going to have the Marine Corps leading 500,000 veterans that we're going to pay mercenary funds to lead a coup d'etat in the United States.
[00:17:43.903 --> 00:17:48.387]  And then we're going to dominate the world and we're going to work with Adolf Hitler and take over the planet.
[00:17:49.388 --> 00:17:49.929]  With England.
[00:17:49.989 --> 00:17:58.718]  By the way, England then, of course, had the King of England at the time was a pro-Nazi and had to advocate because that happened and that came out.
[00:17:59.038 --> 00:18:00.299]  Edward VIII, King of England.
[00:18:02.801 --> 00:18:06.285]  And that's all in the encyclopedia if you'd like to go look into it.
[00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:13.255]  So, that happened, and Butler said, listen, I might have overthrown all these other countries, but I'm not going to do that here.
[00:18:13.836 --> 00:18:15.978]  I thought I would just bring up again one little example of that.
[00:18:17.356 --> 00:18:24.382]  Now, there are 180,000 contractors in Iraq, but there are over 150,000 subcontractors.
[00:18:24.402 --> 00:18:27.625]  So that's 300 plus thousand mercenaries.
[00:18:28.285 --> 00:18:31.128]  On average paid about $150,000 apiece.
[00:18:31.468 --> 00:18:40.715]  When the average military man or woman over there is getting paid about $30,000 apiece and gets about one month off a year and is forced to serve on average more than three tours.
[00:18:41.096 --> 00:18:46.020]  Halliburton also has some of these forces, but they're mainly just in the technical realm.
[00:18:46.767 --> 00:18:53.452]  They're the largest group of contractors, but the largest group of armed contingent is, of course, Blackwater.
[00:18:54.493 --> 00:18:59.257]  And so you have 320,000 plus contractors over there.
[00:19:00.198 --> 00:19:10.145]  And we had, of course, from the start, warned you about Rand Corporation documents and public statements that they wanted to later, and they did use them in New Orleans, use Blackwater, Halliburton, and others.
[00:19:10.626 --> 00:19:14.309]  Now, by the way, Halliburton is in Basin, Dubai, no longer a U.S.
[00:19:14.329 --> 00:19:15.810]  corporation, but I guess that's okay with people.
[00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:38.217]  to run domestic operations, and they've said now, oh, Blackwater's going to fight the drug war in your cities and on the border, just like they watered down the 1878 law barring the military from domestic operations, the Posse Comitatus Act, which they haven't fully overturned, but in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, they've basically cut it back to near nothing.
[00:19:38.498 --> 00:19:42.579]  So there's a shadow left of it, and on paper they act like it's still there.
[00:19:43.752 --> 00:19:47.895]  So it's bad enough to have the military operating domestically in the country against the people.
[00:19:48.475 --> 00:19:49.536]  Hitler did do that.
[00:19:49.976 --> 00:19:54.439]  But what Hitler didn't do was hire foreigners to come in.
[00:19:54.519 --> 00:20:03.665]  Now 20% plus of the army is war illegal aliens from Czech Republic, Mexico is the biggest group, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua.
[00:20:04.525 --> 00:20:09.709]  They of course have hired former death squad commanders to be part of this in Iraq and now they're coming home.
[00:20:10.289 --> 00:20:24.859]  And of course, I told you this eight years ago, now it's mainstream news, and we told you it wasn't in the news, we had this from good sources, that they were actually hiring aggravated felons, also, who were illegal aliens on top of it, out of the federal and state prisons to join the military.
[00:20:24.899 --> 00:20:33.085]  And Hitler did take prisoners out of the prisons to be his SA and then his SS, so he did do that, but they weren't foreigner felons, they were domestic.
[00:20:35.547 --> 00:20:41.213]  That is, nationals who were from Germany or Austria or what was left of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.
[00:20:42.395 --> 00:20:46.339]  So as long as you'd formally been in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, would it be... But I'm getting a little too technical here.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.123]  The point is, let's see how this process works.
[00:20:49.657 --> 00:21:02.380]  In the 80s, in the name of fighting the drug war, the military starts, illegally, they hadn't overturned the law yet, working with police secretly, running drones, busting into gun dealers, raiding drug dealers.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:10.142]  In my film, Road to Tyranny, I interview a Marine Corps commander who had then gotten out and started a computer company in Austin.
[00:21:10.162 --> 00:21:11.462]  I went to his mansion to interview him.
[00:21:11.662 --> 00:21:15.824]  He showed me all the documents and things, but I'd already seen congressional reports on it, but here he was.
[00:21:16.184 --> 00:21:17.584]  He got stopped and kiled
[00:21:18.044 --> 00:21:21.106]  At an army checkpoint, and he said, my God, this is true what you said.
[00:21:21.506 --> 00:21:23.348]  I was in a secret operation in the late 80s.
[00:21:23.868 --> 00:21:26.530]  We were robbing gun shops and other people.
[00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:30.172]  We would dress in police uniforms and aid them.
[00:21:30.192 --> 00:21:32.334]  And I knew it was illegal then, but I thought it was okay.
[00:21:32.674 --> 00:21:33.594]  Now it's happened to me.
[00:21:33.674 --> 00:21:35.195]  Now I'm older and more successful.
[00:21:35.596 --> 00:21:38.117]  I realize that this is a major problem.
[00:21:38.958 --> 00:21:46.623]  But if that's bad enough to have secret military operations all over the country that they're now announcing more and more of after they've been in place for decades,
[00:21:47.725 --> 00:21:53.009]  Now they're saying Blackwater is going to be involved domestically here in the U.S.
[00:21:53.129 --> 00:22:08.099]  And then even when the Army General says they committed 14 murders in that shootout and should be charged, and when the FBI said they should be charged, the White House and State Department said, no, they have total immunity.
[00:22:08.139 --> 00:22:10.740]  And now they're going to have immunity, a domestic force.
[00:22:11.641 --> 00:22:13.062]  See, they're coming home now, folks.
[00:22:14.864 --> 00:22:20.267]  Here in the United States, Caesar took over Rome with just a few thousand cohorts from the 13th.
[00:22:20.327 --> 00:22:25.409]  Can you imagine with hundreds of thousands of mercs what they'll do here domestically?
[00:22:26.109 --> 00:22:36.594]  So see, you get rid of habeas corpus, you get rid of due process, you get rid of posse commentatus, you get rid of all these things, then they're just incrementally phasing in martial law.
[00:22:37.336 --> 00:22:39.078]  This is all happening right now.
[00:22:39.599 --> 00:22:40.860]  And it's not to target Al-Qaeda.
[00:22:41.301 --> 00:22:42.803]  It's to target you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:43.183 --> 00:22:43.884]  We'll be right back.
[00:22:43.924 --> 00:22:44.284]  Stay with us.
[00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.913]  Now, you can enjoy the more than 700 chemicals that have been found in our drinking water.
[00:23:01.234 --> 00:23:06.157]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:23:06.398 --> 00:23:10.761]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:23:11.061 --> 00:23:19.968]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:23:20.188 --> 00:23:23.791]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:23:24.071 --> 00:23:29.095]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:23:29.395 --> 00:23:36.100]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:23:36.607 --> 00:23:37.288]  What about you?
[00:23:37.928 --> 00:23:43.273]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:23:43.333 --> 00:23:44.494]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:23:44.514 --> 00:23:46.396]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:23:58.334 --> 00:23:58.835]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:23:59.335 --> 00:24:01.316]  The nation is taking a Christmas break.
[00:24:01.777 --> 00:24:07.761]  But will the events attacking our liberty and survival call a holiday truce and stop marching forward while we celebrate?
[00:24:08.401 --> 00:24:12.564]  The ethanol plants will continue to create food shortages by turning our food into fuel.
[00:24:13.124 --> 00:24:19.168]  Huge percentages of our food will continue to be imported from China, Mexico, and other countries shipping us dangerous food.
[00:24:19.888 --> 00:24:23.030]  We can't stop from entering the third year of a worldwide famine.
[00:24:23.591 --> 00:24:26.853]  How long until genetically poisoned food is all that's left?
[00:24:27.848 --> 00:24:41.631]  So if we're foolish enough to procrastinate our preparation, hiding from reality and the feel-good of the holidays, the events threatening our lives will keep relentlessly rolling forward until we're crushed by what we couldn't believe possible in America.
[00:24:42.071 --> 00:24:46.773]  Call the J. Michael Stevens Group to get the food for your future while you still have a choice.
[00:24:46.793 --> 00:24:47.493]  800-409-5633.
[00:24:47.513 --> 00:24:48.553]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:24:48.573 --> 00:24:48.713]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:24:57.913 --> 00:25:01.496]  Want to know the secret to finding a shop that can keep your car running like new?
[00:25:01.696 --> 00:25:05.599]  Find the cleanest shop in town, where cleaning is top priority.
[00:25:05.759 --> 00:25:09.262]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[00:25:09.642 --> 00:25:17.248]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[00:25:17.488 --> 00:25:20.770]  Keep it clean, and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:24.833]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[00:25:25.093 --> 00:25:26.835]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[00:25:27.913 --> 00:25:30.834]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[00:25:30.854 --> 00:25:32.375]  A tornado under your hood!
[00:25:32.475 --> 00:25:38.358]  A tornado is an easy-to-install, maintenance-free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[00:25:38.698 --> 00:25:45.842]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles, and all of them gained MPG with Tornado.
[00:25:45.982 --> 00:25:50.804]  With today's gas prices, it makes sense to cage the gas-saving power of a tornado.
[00:25:50.984 --> 00:25:56.187]  Visit tornadoair.com or go to Pep Boys, Napa, or AutoZone today.
[00:25:58.419 --> 00:26:00.821]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:26:01.341 --> 00:26:04.623]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:26:05.023 --> 00:26:07.945]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:26:08.245 --> 00:26:14.609]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:26:14.689 --> 00:26:19.112]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:26:19.332 --> 00:26:23.714]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:26:23.855 --> 00:26:26.456]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:26:26.476 --> 00:26:29.257]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:26:29.718 --> 00:26:32.259]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:36.541]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:26:36.601 --> 00:26:37.442]  Treasury bonds.
[00:26:37.722 --> 00:26:42.365]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:26:42.525 --> 00:26:44.166]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:46.368]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-8XANADU and ask for George.
[00:26:46.468 --> 00:26:47.368]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:26:47.428 --> 00:26:48.249]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:27:07.628 --> 00:27:09.249]  Dillberg is making great progress.
[00:27:19.055 --> 00:27:19.936]  Welcome back.
[00:27:19.956 --> 00:27:22.857]  Your calls are coming up here in just a moment.
[00:27:22.937 --> 00:27:24.178]  On this 25th day of November 2007.
[00:27:38.547 --> 00:27:41.508]  Hillary Clinton is nothing but a pawn, a puppet, a nobody.
[00:27:42.628 --> 00:27:43.548]  So was the President.
[00:27:46.349 --> 00:28:00.953]  The Fortune 100 are bigger than most countries on Earth, their GDPs, and together they are many times greater than the United States.
[00:28:02.593 --> 00:28:03.613]  Who lobbies for you?
[00:28:03.673 --> 00:28:04.534]  Who speaks for you?
[00:28:05.114 --> 00:28:06.114]  Who stands up for you?
[00:28:07.404 --> 00:28:17.550]  The establishment for at least 100 years has knowingly used psychological warfare programs, this is published, against you.
[00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:21.192]  Over 100 years ago, the American Banking Association said you were too smart.
[00:28:21.552 --> 00:28:22.813]  That Americans were too educated.
[00:28:22.833 --> 00:28:24.554]  The smartest, most educated people in the world.
[00:28:24.574 --> 00:28:27.875]  They said they were going to buy up and control education and change it.
[00:28:28.196 --> 00:28:28.976]  And dumb you down.
[00:28:29.797 --> 00:28:30.457]  Dumb us down.
[00:28:31.596 --> 00:28:36.240]  And they did that all so they could more easily control our population.
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:41.343]  We were the big prize, the big rich nation, 4% of the world with more than half the wealth.
[00:28:43.065 --> 00:28:56.535]  And when your military is already 20% foreigner, and many of them aggravated felons, that's textbook tyranny, when they're now saying mercenaries are going to domestically operate against the American people,
[00:28:57.876 --> 00:29:07.559]  When they openly shipped in more than forty billion dollars in one shipment, there have been many others since, in hundred and thousand dollar bills on pallets.
[00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:18.742]  Remember, three years ago I told you, in fact before the war, four years ago I told you they were going to pay off the troops and train them and prepare them to transfer over into the new mercenary armies.
[00:29:20.542 --> 00:29:23.383]  And I told you that a private, on average,
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:30.285]  One year into the war, it was being given more than $30,000 in cash to corrupt them.
[00:29:30.325 --> 00:29:44.979]  Then they would go to the different green zones, there's not just one, there's one official one in Baghdad, and spend their money on the prostitutes brought in by the big companies, the liquor, the drugs, the gambling, and then that money just goes right back to them.
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:52.506]  And that was meant to corrupt the troops and prepare them to later transfer over and be mercenaries.
[00:29:52.526 --> 00:29:53.247]  And that's what's happening.
[00:29:53.267 --> 00:29:56.591]  They're getting out and they're joining the different mercenary groups.
[00:29:56.991 --> 00:29:58.353]  And there are more than 30 of them.
[00:29:58.553 --> 00:30:02.377]  Blackwater being the biggest armed group, Halliburton having armed subsidiaries.
[00:30:02.397 --> 00:30:05.680]  And that's what they've done.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.663]  They primed the pump and gave them a taste and prepared them
[00:30:10.024 --> 00:30:14.627]  And are now openly saying no more Bill of Rights or Constitution in the U.S.
[00:30:14.687 --> 00:30:19.771]  and going, yeah, we are going to use the Patriot Act against the American people in non-terror related cases.
[00:30:20.011 --> 00:30:25.094]  Yeah, we're going to use no more warrants for wiretaps and spying on you and tracking your cell phones.
[00:30:25.134 --> 00:30:25.915]  I told you that in 96.
[00:30:26.075 --> 00:30:27.096]  I saw the federal plan.
[00:30:27.796 --> 00:30:28.897]  This isn't about Bush.
[00:30:28.917 --> 00:30:29.898]  This isn't about Hillary.
[00:30:29.918 --> 00:30:30.678]  They're just puppets.
[00:30:30.978 --> 00:30:34.401]  This system moves forward against us all.
[00:30:35.141 --> 00:30:37.123]  And it's happening all over the planet.
[00:30:37.403 --> 00:30:38.964]  I mean, I read here today
[00:30:39.947 --> 00:30:42.969]  You can have a protest with 20 people, a protest with 500 people.
[00:30:43.429 --> 00:30:53.414]  They send police out in the same black uniforms, the same black armor, the same billy clubs to beat the demonstrations, and they say no demonstrations allowed.
[00:30:53.855 --> 00:30:58.837]  If you want to have one, you can have one at the edge of town at a soccer field.
[00:30:59.798 --> 00:31:01.419]  It's a free-speak zone.
[00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:02.539]  Same term.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.242]  In fact, here is the Associated Press today.
[00:31:08.878 --> 00:31:14.000]  25th of November, riot police arrest 150, a new anti-Putin demonstration.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:19.741]  Russian riot police Sunday detained opposition leaders and more than 150 other protesters in St.
[00:31:19.781 --> 00:31:25.423]  Petersburg as they broke up a segment demonstration against President Vladimir Putin in the last two days.
[00:31:26.203 --> 00:31:34.645]  It says the demonstrations were protesting against the police state, the destruction of liberties, the fact that Putin's refusing to stand down.
[00:31:35.266 --> 00:31:36.586]  It goes on and on.
[00:31:39.548 --> 00:31:51.755]  And it goes on to say that they had refused, the 40s had refused to authorize a march, giving permission only for a stationary demonstration in a different square on the edge of town.
[00:31:51.775 --> 00:31:57.699]  See, the same thing they do in Russia that's universally decried as total police state, they're now doing here.
[00:31:57.819 --> 00:31:59.740]  Same black uniforms, same outfits.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.743]  This is a global government, global corporations, that are not free market.
[00:32:04.983 --> 00:32:18.111]  Powerful men, dominant men, who get together and say, hey, we're bigger than countries, let's set up a new global system that doesn't have the checks and balances in it, and let's take over the planet, and let's not allow anyone to demonstrate against us.
[00:32:19.872 --> 00:32:23.955]  The British Ministry of Defense 10-year prospectus put out four months ago,
[00:32:25.291 --> 00:32:31.373]  In its entirety, openly talked about how the government's here to suppress and dominate the public for the global corporations.
[00:32:31.813 --> 00:32:38.354]  The head of the Naval War College, Thomas Barnett, gets up on C-SPAN and admits our military works for the big central banks.
[00:32:39.314 --> 00:32:43.195]  I mean, it's out in the open, but normal people don't watch C-SPAN.
[00:32:44.356 --> 00:32:46.516]  You're watching 15 college bowl games.
[00:32:47.796 --> 00:32:49.917]  And yeah, they're fun, they're neat to watch, it's great.
[00:32:50.603 --> 00:32:52.864]  To slurp beer and eat pizza and stumble around.
[00:32:53.144 --> 00:32:55.804]  But you can't do that when this stuff is going on.
[00:32:56.525 --> 00:32:59.446]  You're an expert on male soap operas that are football.
[00:32:59.466 --> 00:33:04.227]  You know, who's getting fired, what coach is getting fired, who's being hired, who's getting drafted.
[00:33:04.247 --> 00:33:05.887]  It's male soap operas.
[00:33:06.387 --> 00:33:08.188]  And I'm not saying I'm not into it.
[00:33:09.848 --> 00:33:15.250]  But the point is, I don't have time to be into that because so many serious things are happening.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.142]  Let's go ahead and take some phone calls.
[00:33:19.202 --> 00:33:21.204]  Let me see who's been holding here the longest.
[00:33:22.325 --> 00:33:27.109]  There's a North American Union article I see, according to Matt in Boston, who's first up.
[00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:28.891]  You're on the air worldwide, sir.
[00:33:28.951 --> 00:33:29.271]  Welcome.
[00:33:30.212 --> 00:33:30.593]  Hey, Alex.
[00:33:30.613 --> 00:33:31.133]  How's it going?
[00:33:31.153 --> 00:33:31.454]  Good, sir.
[00:33:32.334 --> 00:33:36.198]  Yeah, there was just this article in the Boston World Today entitled, The Amaro Conspiracy.
[00:33:37.506 --> 00:33:41.627]  Well, it's basically a hit piece about the people who believe in the North American Union.
[00:33:41.707 --> 00:33:43.348]  It just calls us all conspiracy theorists.
[00:33:43.368 --> 00:33:43.888]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[00:33:43.928 --> 00:34:05.534]  There's been a flotilla, literally hundreds the last couple months, and they always say, we're nuts, it doesn't exist, though Judicial Watch sued and got the North American Union documents from September last year, and then Bush made a bunch public from the meeting two months ago in Ottawa, and it says North American Union, it says carbon taxes, it says merging our militaries, it says it all.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:22.741]  Yeah, well it was an interesting article because it mentioned that there is an SVP, that the Council on Foreign Relations published a report called Building a North American Community, but it says people who actually put the connected dots are conspiracy theorists for some reason.
[00:34:24.245 --> 00:34:27.187]  And they're counting on you to just read headlines.
[00:34:27.627 --> 00:34:31.509]  They're counting on you to just, you know, just basically believe what they're saying.
[00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:32.250]  I'm not.
[00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:36.152]  I'm counting on you to go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:36.172 --> 00:34:38.634]  We have links to the CFR's own prospectus.
[00:34:38.954 --> 00:34:42.616]  We have links to the SPP documents that Judicial Watch had to sue to get.
[00:34:43.196 --> 00:34:45.057]  They're the folks that almost brought Clinton down, by the way.
[00:34:45.077 --> 00:34:46.078]  They're not some liberals.
[00:34:46.678 --> 00:34:48.779]  And it's all there.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.321]  My film, Endgame, shows all these documents.
[00:34:52.862 --> 00:34:56.984]  Well, I just thought it was a pretty interesting article, and I just want to say thank you for all you do, Alex.
[00:34:57.604 --> 00:34:58.404]  Thank you, my friend.
[00:34:58.424 --> 00:35:09.889]  Yeah, I would tell people in 96 that I'd read in industry publications that all cell phones were to be GPS-tracked off a triangulation with the cell towers, and that they were going to do all this because I had official government documents.
[00:35:10.606 --> 00:35:11.967]  And then now it's common news.
[00:35:12.067 --> 00:35:18.171]  Or I told you, hey, they're going to claim there's no Fourth Amendment to track Al-Qaeda, but then they're going to say, by the way, it's for all crime.
[00:35:18.591 --> 00:35:19.992]  That's in the Washington Post today.
[00:35:20.052 --> 00:35:26.756]  It says in just regular cases they're not getting warrants now citing the Patriot Act and other federal rulings.
[00:35:26.836 --> 00:35:27.736]  Just no Fourth Amendment.
[00:35:29.397 --> 00:35:31.118]  Again, we're just going over the facts here.
[00:35:31.999 --> 00:35:37.522]  Now let us go ahead and speak to Jason in Columbus, Ohio.
[00:35:37.582 --> 00:35:38.243]  You're on the air.
[00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:38.603]  Welcome.
[00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:40.831]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:43.774]  Words can't express what an honor it is to actually speak with you.
[00:35:43.834 --> 00:35:44.875]  It's an honor to speak to you, sir.
[00:35:45.376 --> 00:35:45.916]  Thank you, sir.
[00:35:46.537 --> 00:35:50.601]  We went and saw the quote-unquote patriot Glenn Beck last night.
[00:35:51.461 --> 00:35:53.824]  The fake conservative there to neutralize the American people?
[00:35:53.864 --> 00:35:54.064]  Yes.
[00:35:54.364 --> 00:35:58.328]  Who says that Ron Paul supporters are terrorists and that the Army should be used against us on CNN?
[00:35:58.368 --> 00:35:58.829]  What did he say?
[00:35:59.429 --> 00:35:59.889]  Absolutely.
[00:35:59.949 --> 00:36:05.193]  Well, I went up and had a person behind me with a camera ask him why he hadn't had Ron Paul on the show.
[00:36:05.673 --> 00:36:09.235]  He said he would absolutely love to have Ron Paul on the show and extend him the entire hour.
[00:36:09.935 --> 00:36:14.778]  And we caught that on video, him saying that he would give Ron Paul the... Stay there!
[00:36:14.838 --> 00:36:16.219]  I want to hear what else happened, okay?
[00:36:16.239 --> 00:36:16.800]  Don't hang up.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.622]  We're going to come back to you right after this break, Jason in Columbus, Ohio.
[00:36:21.663 --> 00:36:27.046]  Then we'll go to John, Rasheen, Jedi, Martin, and many others.
[00:36:27.786 --> 00:36:32.433]  I'm Alex Jones, dedicated to defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:36:32.793 --> 00:36:39.022]  The websites are TruthNews.us, Infowars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:39.502 --> 00:36:41.185]  We'll be back after these quick messages.
[00:36:41.625 --> 00:36:44.970]  The second hour has got an interview with Ron Paul, I did, and a lot more.
[00:36:55.333 --> 00:36:57.975]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter.
[00:36:58.175 --> 00:37:01.717]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:37:01.777 --> 00:37:02.277]  are located?
[00:37:02.498 --> 00:37:05.880]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:10.803]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:37:11.103 --> 00:37:16.106]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:37:16.346 --> 00:37:16.926]  We're good to go!
[00:37:35.012 --> 00:37:35.633]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:38:00.712 --> 00:38:02.412]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[00:38:02.853 --> 00:38:05.953]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[00:38:06.573 --> 00:38:11.255]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[00:38:11.895 --> 00:38:13.875]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[00:38:14.395 --> 00:38:19.997]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[00:38:20.697 --> 00:38:24.358]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[00:38:25.325 --> 00:38:29.047]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[00:38:29.547 --> 00:38:34.709]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[00:38:35.389 --> 00:38:43.633]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[00:38:44.093 --> 00:38:45.354]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:38:45.394 --> 00:38:45.694]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:58.643]  It's a fact.
[00:38:58.863 --> 00:39:06.328]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:39:06.448 --> 00:39:15.335]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:39:15.595 --> 00:39:26.143]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:39:26.403 --> 00:39:32.466]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:39:32.666 --> 00:39:37.689]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:39:37.869 --> 00:39:42.371]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:39:42.531 --> 00:39:44.332]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:39:44.372 --> 00:39:44.652]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:39:44.672 --> 00:39:45.192]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:39:45.272 --> 00:39:47.053]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:39:56.859 --> 00:40:04.525]  This is George Whitehurst Barry with the Genesis Communications Network.
[00:40:04.986 --> 00:40:07.408]  Welcome to our new program, Crash!
[00:40:07.728 --> 00:40:08.389]  Are you ready?
[00:40:08.709 --> 00:40:14.834]  In the coming weeks, we will focus on alternative economics, as well as alternative health and survival topics.
[00:40:15.194 --> 00:40:18.597]  We are now in the largest debt bubble in U.S.
[00:40:18.657 --> 00:40:19.078]  history.
[00:40:19.458 --> 00:40:22.641]  A subset of the debt bubble is the real estate bubble.
[00:40:23.221 --> 00:40:30.168]  And I believe we are in the beginning stages of what could be the biggest real estate crash in our nation's history.
[00:40:30.468 --> 00:40:35.493]  For crash updates, visit our website at hereinonline.com.
[00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:42.740]  That's H-E-A-R-I-T-O-N-L-I-N-E dot com.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:52.043]  Here at Online.com, that's H-E-A-R-I-T-O-N-L-I-N-E dot com.
[00:40:52.163 --> 00:41:00.126]  You're listening to GPN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:41:10.763 --> 00:41:13.445]  Yeah, next hour we'll be interviewing Ron Paul.
[00:41:13.886 --> 00:41:16.328]  Ask him about Glenn Beck and others.
[00:41:16.408 --> 00:41:18.850]  It's a White House talking point that's now come out in the news.
[00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:26.896]  To say that those that are anti-war, or those that support Ron Paul, who are libertarians, are working with the, quote, Islamic fascists.
[00:41:27.777 --> 00:41:28.738]  Just unbelievable.
[00:41:28.918 --> 00:41:30.219]  We warned you they would do this.
[00:41:30.579 --> 00:41:31.260]  They're now doing it.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.843]  And we were just now talking to Jason
[00:41:36.023 --> 00:41:42.749]  Absolutely.
[00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:48.794]  Two really big important points.
[00:41:48.874 --> 00:41:56.480]  The first one is that we caught him on video inviting Ron Paul on his show at Ron Paul's convenience and said that he would give him the entire hour.
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.342]  He almost made it seem like Ron Paul was dodging him.
[00:42:00.041 --> 00:42:01.282]  Well, we all know that's not the case.
[00:42:02.302 --> 00:42:04.363]  And we were actually able to catch that on video.
[00:42:04.703 --> 00:42:07.365]  I think he said it because he did not know that he was being videotaped.
[00:42:07.745 --> 00:42:08.585]  What else did he say?
[00:42:09.666 --> 00:42:14.228]  That's really about all that he said, as we got ushered out, of course, really quickly.
[00:42:14.888 --> 00:42:22.352]  The other real important point is, is all of the people that look like they were Secret Service all were over the place.
[00:42:23.152 --> 00:42:27.654]  I got there at 8 o'clock in the morning, about 12 hours before the actual book signing.
[00:42:27.714 --> 00:42:29.075]  Black SUV in the parking lot.
[00:42:29.395 --> 00:42:31.195]  Well, it's been admitted that even the show that
[00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:05.274]  They do on HBO that's been attacking patriots, has gotten different mercenary groups to protect them.
[00:43:05.514 --> 00:43:06.774]  And again, this is the new system.
[00:43:06.794 --> 00:43:10.976]  The whole apparatus of anti-terror is for the American people.
[00:43:11.757 --> 00:43:15.098]  We don't want their North American Union, their open borders, their gun control.
[00:43:15.398 --> 00:43:16.879]  The Supreme Court about to hear that.
[00:43:17.559 --> 00:43:18.500]  That's what this is all about.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:21.922]  So I need you, sir, to go ahead and upload that video to YouTube as soon as possible.
[00:43:22.342 --> 00:43:22.822]  It has been up.
[00:43:23.262 --> 00:43:23.602]  I'm sorry.
[00:43:23.622 --> 00:43:24.803]  Okay, what's the name of the video?
[00:43:25.503 --> 00:43:31.646]  The name of the video, it's my actual... I sent it to you late last night to your email address at Prison Plana.
[00:43:31.966 --> 00:43:33.227]  That's fine, but it's up on YouTube.
[00:43:33.247 --> 00:43:34.948]  Just give me the tag.
[00:43:36.148 --> 00:43:40.231]  The tag is... I'm sorry, I'm gonna sound like an idiot.
[00:43:40.411 --> 00:43:41.011]  What's the tag?
[00:43:42.191 --> 00:43:44.593]  Glenn Beck wants Ron Paul for the full hour.
[00:43:44.993 --> 00:43:46.934]  Okay, Glenn Beck wants Ron Paul for the full hour.
[00:43:46.994 --> 00:43:48.094]  Guys, put that in YouTube.
[00:43:48.134 --> 00:43:49.095]  Was it YouTube or Google?
[00:43:49.954 --> 00:43:50.415]  In YouTube.
[00:43:50.435 --> 00:43:51.136]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:43:51.156 --> 00:43:52.577]  My full name is Jason Hick, H-I-C-K.
[00:44:05.479 --> 00:44:09.401]  Okay, we are going to do a story on this then once we see your video.
[00:44:10.061 --> 00:44:11.422]  And that is just amazing.
[00:44:11.502 --> 00:44:15.204]  So they definitely had security there watching out.
[00:44:15.484 --> 00:44:16.184]  Oh no!
[00:44:16.544 --> 00:44:26.049]  Because Glenn Beck, the little precious propagandist, is out on tour and we've got to watch the American people, not the 30 million illegal aliens calling for the end of the U.S.
[00:44:26.089 --> 00:44:26.629]  running around.
[00:44:27.149 --> 00:44:31.710]  Not for the fact that our dollars are plunging by design with the Federal Reserve's policies.
[00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:34.951]  Not the fact that we're hated worldwide because of all these illegal wars.
[00:44:35.271 --> 00:44:37.192]  It's the American people we've got to watch.
[00:44:37.232 --> 00:44:38.252]  What did you say to these guys?
[00:44:39.573 --> 00:44:43.514]  Well, I acted like I didn't know what they were talking about because I didn't want to get thrown out.
[00:44:44.354 --> 00:44:46.555]  So I just really played stupid and acted like I didn't know.
[00:44:46.595 --> 00:44:50.656]  So now they've gotten to the point of having to question everyone at these events.
[00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:51.742]  Yes.
[00:44:52.362 --> 00:44:54.183]  I know that we were not the only people that approached.
[00:44:54.523 --> 00:44:58.405]  One other quick point, Cody Deeds was there with We Are Change Ohio.
[00:44:59.066 --> 00:45:03.127]  He made a great video of him actually confronting Glenn Beckwith.
[00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:03.648]  Oh good!
[00:45:03.808 --> 00:45:04.748]  What's the name of that video?
[00:45:05.268 --> 00:45:07.630]  That is on WeAreChange.org.
[00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:08.750]  Oh good.
[00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:10.911]  The We Are Change guys are doing such a great job.
[00:45:10.991 --> 00:45:12.872]  I can't even keep track of everything they're doing.
[00:45:13.892 --> 00:45:32.279]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, in a clip coming up, you're going to hear Fox News saying, a Code Pink lady stood up last week to Hillary, as well as a Code Pink male member, and said, hey, you said you were against the war, we sent Democrats to Congress, but the war continues, and they drug them out, and Fox News said, you know,
[00:45:32.819 --> 00:45:34.200]  These people can't keep doing this.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.602]  They can't think they can do this without being tasered or beaten to a pulp.
[00:45:37.902 --> 00:45:39.022]  They need to be tasered.
[00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:43.825]  In our new higher security with terrorism, we need to taser them and beat them.
[00:45:44.491 --> 00:45:45.351]  See, just like Russia.
[00:45:46.051 --> 00:45:48.032]  Oh, the American people are getting active.
[00:45:48.372 --> 00:45:50.313]  They're confronting Republicans and Democrats.
[00:45:50.333 --> 00:45:51.953]  They're saying they don't want a new world order.
[00:45:52.353 --> 00:45:54.014]  They're saying they don't want more wars.
[00:45:54.294 --> 00:45:56.334]  They're saying they don't want a North American Union.
[00:45:56.794 --> 00:45:58.215]  Oh, they're bad!
[00:45:58.795 --> 00:46:01.056]  The problem is, 80 plus percent don't want the war.
[00:46:01.076 --> 00:46:03.516]  91 percent in Gallup polls don't want open borders.
[00:46:03.536 --> 00:46:06.097]  70 plus percent are pro-Second Amendment.
[00:46:06.901 --> 00:46:10.522]  So, this whole system is about going after the American people.
[00:46:10.982 --> 00:46:12.243]  Folks, I want to see this video.
[00:46:13.583 --> 00:46:17.245]  To Amanda and to Trey in there, go to wearechange.org right now.
[00:46:17.285 --> 00:46:19.545]  Let's see that video.
[00:46:20.006 --> 00:46:22.506]  Let's track exactly what's happening.
[00:46:22.546 --> 00:46:24.787]  We may even air it, because I'm authorized to air all that stuff.
[00:46:24.807 --> 00:46:25.828]  I'm in affiliation with them.
[00:46:26.148 --> 00:46:27.428]  I don't give them orders from headquarters.
[00:46:27.448 --> 00:46:28.268]  They just do whatever they want.
[00:46:28.308 --> 00:46:29.749]  We're all just out there fighting for freedom.
[00:46:30.229 --> 00:46:30.790]  We're good to go.
[00:46:47.956 --> 00:46:49.277]  I mean, we've done nothing violent.
[00:46:49.317 --> 00:46:50.137]  We've done nothing.
[00:46:50.197 --> 00:46:53.218]  We're just here exposing the New World Order.
[00:46:53.258 --> 00:46:58.940]  But see, now they're using that whole anti-terrorist system they built up because they're losing the debate.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:46:59.900]  They're losing the fight.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:06.403]  In fact, on the Fox News pieces we've seen with O'Reilly and the others and Glenn Beck and others, they keep saying, no one believes us.
[00:47:06.443 --> 00:47:08.523]  Congress only has an 11% approval rating.
[00:47:08.763 --> 00:47:10.124]  The people don't trust us anymore.
[00:47:10.644 --> 00:47:13.528]  And it's these Ron Paul people that are trying to destroy America!
[00:47:14.329 --> 00:47:14.870]  They're trying!
[00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:18.414]  No, no, we're the ones trying to save what's left of it!
[00:47:19.575 --> 00:47:26.384]  We're not the Republican and Democratic parties going after the Second Amendment, going after the borders, going after the dollar, going after everything!
[00:47:27.666 --> 00:47:29.488]  So I'm just absolutely blown away right now.
[00:47:30.168 --> 00:47:32.190]  Let's talk to Rasheem in New York City.
[00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.931]  You're on the air.
[00:47:32.971 --> 00:47:33.672]  Welcome, Rasheem.
[00:47:34.052 --> 00:47:35.433]  Yes, good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[00:47:35.633 --> 00:47:35.893]  Hi.
[00:47:36.234 --> 00:47:38.836]  You know, it's a pleasure meeting you out here back on September 9th.
[00:47:38.896 --> 00:47:40.117]  I got a chance to see Endgame.
[00:47:40.458 --> 00:47:41.058]  Great movie, man.
[00:47:41.298 --> 00:47:41.659]  Thank you.
[00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:44.621]  All right, listen, you know, I have some good news for everybody.
[00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:50.767]  I've been working on it on Wall Street now for the last four years, and people are starting to wake up to the money system.
[00:47:51.427 --> 00:47:53.829]  People, you know, I have a lot of friends that are traders.
[00:47:53.949 --> 00:47:59.274]  Myself, personally, I'm an IT person, so I'll get... Now they know the Federal Reserve is private, devaluing the dollar by design, or what do they know?
[00:47:59.854 --> 00:48:05.719]  They're starting to understand that the Fed is very bad for open markets, which is a start.
[00:48:05.939 --> 00:48:13.045]  I mean, you couldn't convince the average trader that that was the case, but now they're starting to see that inflating the dollar... Well, see, that's the thing.
[00:48:13.085 --> 00:48:16.108]  When they implode America, they know everybody's going to wake up.
[00:48:16.428 --> 00:48:19.971]  That's why they set up the oppressive police state apparatus first.
[00:48:20.431 --> 00:48:20.972]  Absolutely.
[00:48:21.332 --> 00:48:21.772]  Absolutely.
[00:48:21.872 --> 00:48:30.919]  And living here in Police State New York, I can tell you first hand that, you know, this is going to be... Wireless wiretaps, random searches on the streets, nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:31.700]  Absolutely.
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:34.022]  But I just had to say that to start off with.
[00:48:34.102 --> 00:48:34.562]  Second off...
[00:48:35.883 --> 00:48:41.125]  I don't think people understand how much Ron Paul has affected the GEO political spectrum.
[00:48:41.565 --> 00:48:47.867]  No one has talked about monetary policy, running for president... No one has talked about the North American Union.
[00:48:47.927 --> 00:48:50.068]  No one has ever talked about the New World Order.
[00:48:50.228 --> 00:48:52.469]  Finally, and he's hit the zeitgeist, folks.
[00:48:52.489 --> 00:48:53.569]  It's exploding globally.
[00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:54.689]  People are looking.
[00:48:54.709 --> 00:48:55.850]  There's a mass awakening.
[00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:57.010]  What does Glenn Beck do?
[00:48:57.050 --> 00:49:00.051]  He says, we're all terrorists and we're going to do something violent.
[00:49:00.251 --> 00:49:02.192]  Meanwhile, they have goons running around at events.
[00:49:02.572 --> 00:49:03.033]  Absolutely.
[00:49:03.393 --> 00:49:14.465]  And to Jason's defense, I don't think Ron Paul should go on Glenn Beck because it'll just be another O'Reilly type interview where he doesn't get to talk and it'll just be a waste of his time.
[00:49:14.505 --> 00:49:17.048]  Don't give Glenn Beck any type of publicity.
[00:49:17.088 --> 00:49:17.889]  He's a scumbag.
[00:49:17.909 --> 00:49:18.550]  We all know it.
[00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:19.671]  Just move on.
[00:49:19.731 --> 00:49:20.352]  He's nobody.
[00:49:21.443 --> 00:49:26.026]  Well, he'll say he's against the NAU, North American Union, but then promote people that are for it.
[00:49:26.546 --> 00:49:27.727]  And then say we're terrorists.
[00:49:27.767 --> 00:49:28.948]  I mean, how dare them?
[00:49:28.968 --> 00:49:31.329]  We could be attacked by crazies on the streets.
[00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:35.692]  I mean, on Fox they say we ought to start beating people to stand up and ask politicians questions.
[00:49:35.912 --> 00:49:36.753]  We ought to taser them.
[00:49:36.773 --> 00:49:37.634]  This is a threat.
[00:49:37.874 --> 00:49:40.595]  They're afraid of us taking America back peacefully.
[00:49:41.036 --> 00:49:42.156]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:49:42.237 --> 00:49:46.039]  Again, it was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Jones, and keep doing what you're doing, my friend.
[00:49:46.099 --> 00:49:47.280]  God bless you, too, my friend.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.521]  Let's go ahead now and talk.
[00:49:49.401 --> 00:49:51.722]  To Jedi in Bastrop, Texas.
[00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:53.423]  And Jedi, you're on the air.
[00:49:53.483 --> 00:49:53.803]  Welcome.
[00:49:54.303 --> 00:49:55.704]  Alex, great to talk to you again, man.
[00:49:55.964 --> 00:49:56.284]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:56.504 --> 00:49:56.864]  You're on the air.
[00:49:56.884 --> 00:49:57.164]  Go ahead.
[00:49:57.384 --> 00:50:01.766]  I wanted to talk about the drones and the remotely piloted vehicles.
[00:50:01.786 --> 00:50:02.126]  That's right.
[00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:05.487]  The feds are federalizing every major city and they've had drones out for years.
[00:50:05.567 --> 00:50:10.169]  And now Houston tried to keep it secret and set up roadblocks and told the media they weren't supposed to report on it.
[00:50:10.429 --> 00:50:11.910]  The fact that they have drones flying around.
[00:50:12.651 --> 00:50:15.893]  I've been involved with the multi-piloted vehicles for the last three years.
[00:50:16.714 --> 00:50:21.959]  The vehicles that we use are very small, four foot wingspan.
[00:50:21.999 --> 00:50:23.160]  I wish they'd put them on the border.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:28.525]  Well, so do I. But no, we've got to watch those terrorist Americans.
[00:50:29.184 --> 00:50:29.644]  That's right.
[00:50:30.164 --> 00:50:38.406]  But the ones we use are very small, very low end, extremely effective for firefighting, for search and rescue, search and recovery.
[00:50:38.526 --> 00:50:40.747]  But no, the government's got to keep them secret.
[00:50:41.147 --> 00:50:42.467]  No, they have to keep them out of the air.
[00:50:43.067 --> 00:50:50.329]  What we do is, the FAA says that, I'm sorry, the FAA controls the air from one foot off the ground up.
[00:50:51.696 --> 00:51:00.402]  I fly model airplanes, and they're not, the FAA says that's okay, but if I put a camera in... Oh, is that why you're saying that they're keeping it secret in Houston and LA?
[00:51:00.983 --> 00:51:08.228]  I'll get to that in a second, but if you put a camera in an airplane, in a model airplane, then it becomes a commercial airplane and they control it, and they won't let you fly.
[00:51:08.688 --> 00:51:11.190]  You have to get what's called a certificate of authorization.
[00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:12.431]  So what's your main line point?
[00:51:12.651 --> 00:51:22.115]  Well, the main point is what the Houston Police Department did is lie about establishing a temporary flight restriction to keep the news helicopters away from the drone area.
[00:51:22.675 --> 00:51:27.617]  And they used the name of the federal government to keep them away when they had no authority to do so.
[00:51:28.197 --> 00:51:28.958]  That's a good point.
[00:51:28.998 --> 00:51:30.678]  In fact, I know a little bit about that.
[00:51:30.698 --> 00:51:31.619]  Do you want to add more, sir?
[00:51:31.639 --> 00:51:33.880]  Do you want to add more?
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.880]  Okay, he's gone.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:36.941]  We'll put him on hold.
[00:51:36.981 --> 00:51:38.541]  If he's still there when we come back in the next hour, we will.
[00:51:38.802 --> 00:51:39.382]  Tons of news.
[00:51:39.402 --> 00:51:40.382]  The Ron Paul interview.
[00:51:40.622 --> 00:51:41.222]  It's all coming up.
[00:51:41.243 --> 00:51:41.763]  Stay with us.
[00:51:41.783 --> 00:51:42.123]  Next hour.
[00:51:46.835 --> 00:51:48.315]  This is Jack Blood with you.
[00:51:48.375 --> 00:51:50.196]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:51:50.356 --> 00:51:55.537]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:51:55.697 --> 00:51:57.037]  But the symptoms are there.

[00:52:52.326 --> 00:52:54.007]  Take a deep breath.
[00:52:54.047 --> 00:52:56.147]  Let yourself emancipate.
[00:52:56.227 --> 00:52:57.248]  Grab the soul gem.
[00:52:57.288 --> 00:52:57.828]  Hold on.
[00:52:58.923 --> 00:53:01.045]  He stands for truth.
[00:53:01.685 --> 00:53:03.967]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:04.887 --> 00:53:07.289]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:09.691]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:10.251 --> 00:53:13.634]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:53:13.774 --> 00:53:21.279]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:53:26.275 --> 00:53:30.316]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:53:30.336 --> 00:53:40.658]  Getting past the spin, the political fronts, and the things the politicians say, and actually getting into what they do and who pays for their campaigns, who runs this nation.
[00:53:41.739 --> 00:53:44.839]  The Fortune 100, ladies and gentlemen, are bigger than the governments.
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:47.240]  They dwarf any one government.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:51.381]  They are setting up world government to extract your wealth through the governments they control.
[00:53:52.347 --> 00:53:55.371]  They're setting up a global empire, a financial empire.
[00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:57.735]  And Liberty has no say in it.
[00:53:58.236 --> 00:54:06.227]  Congressman Ron Paul has really helped ignite, with the help of the grassroots, a global awakening and global resistance.
[00:54:06.908 --> 00:54:08.190]  It is happening everywhere.
[00:54:09.324 --> 00:54:12.285]  Now, I know we have loaded phone lines here, and we're going to be going to your calls.
[00:54:12.705 --> 00:54:16.765]  TJ, Rob, Tom, Jim, Patriot, many others that are patiently holding up.
[00:54:16.865 --> 00:54:17.385]  One just hung up.
[00:54:17.425 --> 00:54:18.906]  Here's the line, 877-590-5525.
[00:54:19.166 --> 00:54:22.346]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:54:22.486 --> 00:54:30.488]  Also, Estalin, award-winning investigative journalist who's been very accurate in the past, says that elitists are considering assassinating Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:54:31.328 --> 00:54:36.509]  I set him up Friday for the show, best-selling author, national talk show host in Spain.
[00:54:37.369 --> 00:54:41.232]  He's been nothing but accurate in the past and now he has come out with this info.
[00:54:41.272 --> 00:54:42.033]  We couldn't ignore it.
[00:54:42.413 --> 00:54:46.917]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com is the easiest place to find it.
[00:54:46.937 --> 00:54:49.999]  It's right up at the top of the page on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:50.019 --> 00:54:50.800]  That is coming up.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:54.663]  A listener wanted me to, I guess, initiate on air
[00:54:56.124 --> 00:55:03.969]  A cluster of giving during the push to raise at least $6 million in one day and break all previous records for Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:55:04.289 --> 00:55:09.393]  He's raised about $4,300,000 since midnight last night.
[00:55:09.693 --> 00:55:17.578]  Easily online, people give to break that record, but people wanted me to basically lead in with this, so I will.
[00:55:18.019 --> 00:55:21.441]  Pilot to Bombardier, we are approaching the target.
[00:55:22.194 --> 00:55:23.436]  Target sighted.
[00:55:24.297 --> 00:55:25.598]  Target one mile away.
[00:55:25.898 --> 00:55:28.121]  Target one half mile away.
[00:55:28.201 --> 00:55:29.983]  Target one quarter mile away.
[00:55:30.704 --> 00:55:31.585]  Bombardier to power.
[00:55:31.605 --> 00:55:35.389]  Permission to discharge munitions.
[00:55:35.749 --> 00:55:36.630]  Permission granted.
[00:55:37.471 --> 00:55:39.493]  And the bombardier drops the bombs.
[00:55:39.553 --> 00:55:40.534]  The info bombs.
[00:55:40.634 --> 00:55:41.856]  In the info war.
[00:55:42.649 --> 00:55:43.690]  And there you go.
[00:55:44.391 --> 00:55:47.594]  I'm sure hundreds of thousands of people right now are giving.
[00:55:47.934 --> 00:55:55.540]  In a few minutes I'll hit refresh up on PrisonPlanet.com where we have a big link to a live graph that's in real time, and we will see how much is being given.
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.581]  Now by the way, this is all internet.
[00:55:56.822 --> 00:56:02.386]  It's not counting the tens of thousands calling by phone and giving, and then they do that in bunches and then put that in.
[00:56:02.406 --> 00:56:04.108]  That's why you see it surge at times.
[00:56:04.148 --> 00:56:04.969]  It's always moving up.
[00:56:04.989 --> 00:56:07.211]  A couple thousand dollars every minute or so.
[00:56:08.111 --> 00:56:09.112]  But, or sometimes more.
[00:56:09.152 --> 00:56:12.093]  I click it and after 30 seconds and it goes up 10 grand sometimes.
[00:56:12.414 --> 00:56:20.698]  When you click it and it goes up 50 grand, that's when they come in with all the phone calls and the phone number of people that have called and enter all their data for them and then it surges even further.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:24.420]  Target hit!
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.320]  I'll guarantee it.
[00:56:25.701 --> 00:56:26.601]  So a little bit of fun.
[00:56:26.641 --> 00:56:33.505]  Okay, that aside, let me be very very serious about this because frankly when I'm off air I'm much more
[00:56:35.072 --> 00:56:43.114]  Thoughtful, my brain works even in more sharp contrast to what's happening, and I get really reflective at night.
[00:56:43.934 --> 00:56:48.956]  My wife and family and children had gone to sleep last night, and I was done one radio interview.
[00:56:48.996 --> 00:57:02.259]  I was waiting up to go on KCLA, the biggest talk station out in Los Angeles, and I was hungry, so I went to the store to get junk food.
[00:57:03.303 --> 00:57:17.609]  I'm driving to five minutes to the local gas station, and I tune into KLBJ, 590, the station we transmit out of, our flagship affiliate here in Austin, and I listen to Neil Bortz.
[00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:18.890]  He's on.
[00:57:20.115 --> 00:57:22.956]  And, uh, this is turned about as fair play.
[00:57:23.136 --> 00:57:33.701]  My show, I mean, I get attacked by Michael Medved, I get attacked by Michael Reagan, I get attacked by Michael Savage, I get even, five or six times we've gotten it on tape, we've heard about it other times, by Rush Limbaugh.
[00:57:34.501 --> 00:57:38.443]  I've been attacked by people in the federal government.
[00:57:38.983 --> 00:57:46.606]  I have been, I mean, hundreds of hosts have done this, and they have called for my arrest, Michael Medved has done that, my investigation,
[00:57:48.041 --> 00:57:50.763]  They have done all of this.
[00:57:52.103 --> 00:57:56.806]  But I don't... I listen to talk radio and I'm stuck in traffic and I don't listen to a lot of it.
[00:57:56.826 --> 00:57:59.247]  I mean, every day I get calls about Neil Bortz attacking me.
[00:57:59.268 --> 00:58:00.028]  I mean, every day.
[00:58:00.528 --> 00:58:03.830]  And people send me audio clips every few weeks and half the time I don't even click on it and listen to it.
[00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:04.711]  I don't care.
[00:58:05.751 --> 00:58:10.514]  And they tell me, man, this guy's saying you're a traitor, this guy's saying you're evil, this guy's saying you're dangerous, this guy's saying you're a liar.
[00:58:11.434 --> 00:58:12.614]  And this is just one example.
[00:58:13.094 --> 00:58:15.595]  And I'm driving in the car, and first he attacks Ron Paul.
[00:58:15.615 --> 00:58:17.235]  This is the best stuff they run across the country.
[00:58:17.756 --> 00:58:19.156]  This is the things they decide to put back on.
[00:58:19.176 --> 00:58:24.837]  And then next he talks about me, and he says, Alex Jones, he compared me to Timothy McVeigh.
[00:58:25.558 --> 00:58:27.078]  He then, and that's a government op, by the way.
[00:58:27.118 --> 00:58:31.379]  That was done by the government there, and that's been now documented and come out in mainstream news, that they were involved in it.
[00:58:32.219 --> 00:58:34.240]  And he then compared me to Charles Manson.
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:39.381]  And he said that I'm a manipulative moonbat, but
[00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:44.411]  He said something that I've heard probably ten other times.
[00:58:44.431 --> 00:58:46.152]  And again, I'm only listening to a fraction of these people.
[00:58:46.172 --> 00:58:47.672]  YouTube them and send me clips.
[00:58:47.712 --> 00:58:49.233]  And John Gibson said similar things.
[00:58:50.813 --> 00:58:56.555]  Then there was another clip where a caller calls in and plugs me and he says, you know, you shouldn't talk about Alex Jones.
[00:58:58.016 --> 00:58:59.596]  If I was your employer, I'd fire you.
[00:58:59.636 --> 00:59:00.416]  You ought to shut up.
[00:59:00.456 --> 00:59:01.337]  You shouldn't speak out.
[00:59:02.497 --> 00:59:03.557]  And see, the U.S.
[00:59:03.577 --> 00:59:08.279]  government got from the Nazis, this has now been declassified, a ten-step plan for fascism.
[00:59:10.018 --> 00:59:12.260]  And one of the final steps is to intimidate speech.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:22.669]  The Nazis would fire you from your job, make sure you got fired, board up your business, call for your arrest, have thugs beat you up, call for people to beat you up, call for your investigation.
[00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:28.034]  You know, from 1933 to about 38, 39, then Hitler got really serious, started killing people.
[00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:45.721]  And I know that Medved and all those other guys, who's been in the New York Times, went to the White House, openly get talking points, openly have signed up politically to the fake conservative team to suppress the conservative population, the only group that would fight their North American Union, open borders, and gun control.
[00:59:46.202 --> 00:59:47.183]  They're there to neutralize you.
[00:59:49.024 --> 00:59:56.530]  And I realized that the last year, they have been all... I heard Medved say that.
[00:59:57.210 --> 00:59:59.071]  And I've heard Reagan say that.
[00:59:59.131 --> 01:00:01.331]  And I've heard a bunch of these guys say the same thing.
[01:00:01.351 --> 01:00:03.072]  They've been saying it for a year.
[01:00:03.352 --> 01:00:04.372]  Oh, you're going to get fired.
[01:00:04.412 --> 01:00:05.193]  You ought to get arrested.
[01:00:05.213 --> 01:00:06.373]  You shouldn't be allowed to talk like that.
[01:00:06.833 --> 01:00:08.254]  That's to scare the sheeple.
[01:00:08.294 --> 01:00:10.894]  That's for listeners to go, ooh, I think like that.
[01:00:10.914 --> 01:00:12.755]  See, they're in a desperate mode right now to suppress.
[01:00:12.975 --> 01:00:13.995]  Ooh, you ought to get fired.
[01:00:14.796 --> 01:00:15.816]  Ooh, you might get arrested.
[01:00:16.116 --> 01:00:17.257]  Ooh, you might get investigated.
[01:00:17.537 --> 01:00:18.537]  Medved says that every week.
[01:00:19.728 --> 01:00:23.430]  Uh, and I also hear about it from guests who come on the show, congressmen and Amy Wolfe and others.
[01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:25.572]  They say when they go on, he says this to them about me.
[01:00:26.032 --> 01:00:32.956]  I mean, imagine having national talk show hosts and newspapers and magazines call for your arrest.
[01:00:33.136 --> 01:00:35.677]  Imagine them say you're Timothy McVeigh.
[01:00:36.058 --> 01:00:37.378]  Do you know what that's like?
[01:00:38.439 --> 01:00:39.640]  But I'll say what Churchill said.
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:43.642]  We shall go on to the end, whatever the costs may be.
[01:00:45.192 --> 01:00:46.234]  And I'm committed.
[01:00:46.494 --> 01:00:47.295]  I'm not going to turn back.
[01:00:47.315 --> 01:00:53.263]  And understand, they can't demonize, they can't get everybody, they can't investigate everybody, they can't arrest everybody, they can't go after everybody.
[01:00:53.543 --> 01:00:55.125]  They're doing that to intimidate you.
[01:00:55.145 --> 01:00:56.266]  People like me have got to worry.
[01:00:56.627 --> 01:00:58.970]  People like Ron Paul have got to worry.
[01:01:00.471 --> 01:01:03.473]  Because they've said Ron Paul's supporters are terrorists.
[01:01:03.513 --> 01:01:04.114]  Glenn Beck has said it.
[01:01:04.134 --> 01:01:05.475]  We played it, what, two weeks ago here.
[01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:06.515]  He's just out of the blue.
[01:01:06.555 --> 01:01:08.957]  He said the military should be used against domestic enemies.
[01:01:09.297 --> 01:01:12.680]  These Ron Paul supporters are trying to undermine and destroy America.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:18.043]  And then his guest went on to say that we are, quote, in bed with Islamic fascists.
[01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:21.786]  We're the people trying to fight for the borders.
[01:01:21.826 --> 01:01:23.487]  We're the people trying to fight for the Second Amendment.
[01:01:23.507 --> 01:01:27.530]  We're the people fighting the carbon tax, the North American Union, the funding mechanism for this.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.863]  I wish every day that what I was telling you wasn't true.
[01:01:33.104 --> 01:01:35.746]  There's over 200 examples of where our government has staged terror attacks.
[01:01:35.806 --> 01:01:36.767]  Declassified.
[01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:38.288]  They admit it.
[01:01:38.788 --> 01:01:44.192]  Kermit Roosevelt, who ran terror attacks in foreign nations to blame it on groups they wanted to go after, went on NPR and admitted it.
[01:01:44.452 --> 01:01:45.693]  Former CIA Section Chief.
[01:01:46.814 --> 01:01:49.036]  The Italian President just went public and admitted the U.S.
[01:01:49.056 --> 01:01:51.297]  government staged terror attacks there, in the 80s.
[01:01:51.337 --> 01:01:54.220]  He was the head of intelligence at the time, to blame it on their political enemies.
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.961]  And 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:01:57.225 --> 01:02:02.050]  The former head of the German Parliament and former head of intelligence, Andres von Bulow, just went public a few years ago.
[01:02:03.251 --> 01:02:08.396]  Robert Baer, former CIA field commander, has gone public saying all the evidence points towards inside job.
[01:02:08.636 --> 01:02:12.780]  Bill Christensen, former CIA section chief of Europe, has said all evidence shows it's an inside job.
[01:02:13.001 --> 01:02:17.425]  Bill Doyle, the head of the biggest 9-11 victim family group, who lost his son Joey, says it's an inside job.
[01:02:18.124 --> 01:02:20.025]  All I'm doing is telling the truth.
[01:02:20.845 --> 01:02:24.187]  All I'm doing is standing firm and putting my life on the line.
[01:02:24.887 --> 01:02:29.329]  And I am a target of these people, and I get death threats almost every single day.
[01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:32.511]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm doing this for you and your children.
[01:02:32.731 --> 01:02:33.772]  This isn't entertainment.
[01:02:33.952 --> 01:02:34.852]  This isn't a game.
[01:02:35.532 --> 01:02:37.553]  I'm not a sellout whore to the New World Order.
[01:02:38.014 --> 01:02:39.815]  I will defend until the end.
[01:02:40.235 --> 01:02:41.195]  The die is cast.
[01:02:41.455 --> 01:02:42.616]  I'll tell you more when we get back.
[01:02:42.876 --> 01:02:43.716]  Then we'll get into your calls.
[01:02:43.776 --> 01:02:44.797]  And Ron Paul, stay with us.
[01:02:48.843 --> 01:02:50.244]  It is a big idea.
[01:02:50.264 --> 01:02:52.365]  A new world order.
[01:02:53.085 --> 01:02:57.367]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:02:57.987 --> 01:03:00.768]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:03:00.788 --> 01:03:03.050]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:05.971]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:03:06.764 --> 01:03:14.149]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:03:17.111 --> 01:03:22.055]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:03:22.575 --> 01:03:26.036]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:03:26.416 --> 01:03:28.957]  Bill of Rights makes great progress in the New World Order.
[01:03:28.997 --> 01:03:30.117]  Most people have no idea.
[01:03:30.158 --> 01:03:30.918]  They're not after money.
[01:03:30.938 --> 01:03:32.018]  They have all the money they need.
[01:03:32.218 --> 01:03:32.958]  They're after power.
[01:03:33.198 --> 01:03:34.319]  That's what they're after.
[01:03:34.339 --> 01:03:38.900]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:42.541]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:42.661 --> 01:03:45.522]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:03:45.863 --> 01:03:47.003]  You have been warned.
[01:03:47.583 --> 01:03:48.103]  We're good to go.
[01:03:48.123 --> 01:03:48.544]  We're good to go.
[01:03:48.564 --> 01:03:49.064]  We're good to go.
[01:04:01.368 --> 01:04:04.671]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[01:04:04.991 --> 01:04:09.175]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[01:04:09.555 --> 01:04:13.519]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[01:04:13.919 --> 01:04:15.741]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[01:04:16.241 --> 01:04:17.923]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[01:04:18.203 --> 01:04:24.185]  The ideas of strong currency ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[01:04:24.465 --> 01:04:31.248]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[01:04:31.588 --> 01:04:32.469]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[01:04:32.529 --> 01:04:33.309]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:04:33.329 --> 01:04:36.590]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:36.910]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:37.931]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[01:04:48.957 --> 01:04:49.437]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:04:50.018 --> 01:04:51.679]  The world famine is in its third year.
[01:04:52.099 --> 01:04:54.221]  Our harvest is too small to get through the year.
[01:04:54.821 --> 01:05:01.706]  Genetically poisoned food, dangerous food imports, and constantly recalled disease-contaminated foods are mixed in with our safe food.
[01:05:02.506 --> 01:05:05.308]  Farm food production is turned into ethanol fuel.
[01:05:05.949 --> 01:05:06.629]  What should I do?
[01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:09.831]  How long can I afford food or till there's no food?
[01:05:10.432 --> 01:05:11.853]  How long before it's all poisoned?
[01:05:12.466 --> 01:05:14.707]  Will three years worth of food supply be enough?
[01:05:15.187 --> 01:05:18.629]  Or will it only postpone my trip to the population control breadline?
[01:05:19.089 --> 01:05:21.190]  Will it be okay to wait till after the holidays?
[01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:25.612]  I'll use what I didn't spend on Christmas for a something-is-better-than-nothing supply.
[01:05:26.092 --> 01:05:26.972]  I'll get the rest later.
[01:05:26.992 --> 01:05:28.273]  How long do I dare wait?
[01:05:29.116 --> 01:05:32.319]  I know I'll regret not starting sooner and not getting enough food.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:35.082]  I have to decide while I still have a choice.
[01:05:35.562 --> 01:05:36.483]  Tell me what to do.
[01:05:37.144 --> 01:05:39.726]  Now take your own advice and call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:05:39.766 --> 01:05:40.047]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:05:48.684 --> 01:05:49.324]  It's a fact.
[01:05:49.545 --> 01:05:57.029]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:05:57.149 --> 01:06:06.014]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:06:06.294 --> 01:06:16.820]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:23.144]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:06:23.364 --> 01:06:28.387]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:33.070]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:06:33.211 --> 01:06:35.012]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:06:35.072 --> 01:06:35.332]  That's 877-943-8600.
[01:06:35.352 --> 01:06:35.772]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:06:35.872 --> 01:06:37.693]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:06:44.738 --> 01:06:46.099]  Every Sunday, 5 to 7 p.m.
[01:06:46.159 --> 01:06:51.242]  Eastern, 4 to 6 Central, 3 to 5 Mountain, 2 to 4 Pacific, we're here
[01:07:13.883 --> 01:07:15.084]  Live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:16.385 --> 01:07:17.605]  Five days a week isn't enough.
[01:07:20.067 --> 01:07:22.688]  You know, I was a big Republican in college.
[01:07:23.209 --> 01:07:24.509]  I'm a conservative gun owner.
[01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:25.630]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:31.853]  And I discovered, more than a decade ago, the Republican Party was bought and paid for by the same people that own the Democratic Party.
[01:07:31.893 --> 01:07:33.514]  And most Americans now know that.
[01:07:34.335 --> 01:07:34.995]  And understand that.
[01:07:36.216 --> 01:07:43.040]  And to hear these mainline talk show hosts sit up there and say there's no North American Union, say the Federal Reserve isn't private,
[01:07:43.982 --> 01:07:45.082]  And they never give any facts.
[01:07:45.483 --> 01:07:46.303]  We give you facts.
[01:07:46.363 --> 01:07:48.464]  We post the documentation.
[01:07:48.924 --> 01:07:50.484]  We have the facts.
[01:07:50.564 --> 01:07:51.745]  We have the information.
[01:07:52.625 --> 01:07:54.406]  By the way, I just hit refresh after 10 minutes.
[01:07:54.466 --> 01:07:56.266]  Over $150,000 went in.
[01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:57.887]  I guess our listeners just donated $150,000.
[01:07:57.947 --> 01:08:00.528]  It wasn't going up that fast.
[01:08:01.068 --> 01:08:04.649]  And then the caller had the idea to have that focused attack with our listeners.
[01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:06.129]  And who knows?
[01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:07.930]  Maybe it's the Easter Bunny that gave the money.
[01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:09.070]  But over $150,000 just surged in there.
[01:08:11.272 --> 01:08:16.616]  Since the last time I hit refresh at RonPaul2008.com, big link to it, at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.738]  So, put yourself in my shoes.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:27.184]  Imagine having all these heavyweights that literally, publicly, go to the White House and are given marching orders.
[01:08:27.925 --> 01:08:33.289]  And they admit they have White House memos, and these have now been in the news, where they say, we need another 9-11, it really helped us.
[01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:38.293]  Before 9-11, Dick Cheney wrote in PENAC that a big, huge terror attack would help get their agenda through.
[01:08:39.389 --> 01:08:44.010]  Just like Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag in 1933, a few months after being elected, instead of a police state.
[01:08:45.190 --> 01:08:46.591]  And now they're behind Hillary Clinton.
[01:08:46.651 --> 01:08:48.751]  And now, just a few months ago, people couldn't believe me.
[01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.092]  Now that's mainstream talk.
[01:08:51.032 --> 01:08:53.732]  About how, why are the Republicans giving more money to Hillary?
[01:08:53.772 --> 01:08:54.553]  Why are they behind her?
[01:08:54.873 --> 01:08:56.513]  It's establishment power.
[01:08:56.553 --> 01:08:57.713]  They're passing the baton.
[01:08:58.074 --> 01:08:59.794]  Only Ron Paul is a real candidate.
[01:09:01.454 --> 01:09:02.635]  You know, I've never wavered.
[01:09:02.655 --> 01:09:03.975]  I have never, um...
[01:09:06.204 --> 01:09:08.905]  I've always told callers, don't call in and thank me, I'm just doing my job.
[01:09:09.685 --> 01:09:12.226]  I don't cover one one-hundredth of the attacks I'm under.
[01:09:12.707 --> 01:09:14.467]  It isn't about the cult of personality.
[01:09:15.908 --> 01:09:17.929]  And Ron Paul has said that as well with himself.
[01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:28.733]  But I have to tell you that I do need people to rally behind me and to support me and to get my information out even more and to counter these national talk show hosts with tens of millions of listeners apiece because
[01:09:29.793 --> 01:09:33.096]  I'm under attack, and I've had things happen to me I don't talk about on air.
[01:09:33.156 --> 01:09:35.138]  The threats, the death threats.
[01:09:35.598 --> 01:09:36.619]  Trey, you're my producer.
[01:09:36.659 --> 01:09:37.580]  You see just the emails.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.801]  What about the phone calls?
[01:09:38.821 --> 01:09:39.962]  I mean, turn your mic on.
[01:09:40.182 --> 01:09:41.864]  I didn't talk to you about this during break.
[01:09:41.884 --> 01:09:43.465]  He's having to swing his mic around.
[01:09:43.986 --> 01:09:45.607]  But the people calling up threatening to kill us.
[01:09:45.747 --> 01:09:46.508]  I mean, all of it.
[01:09:46.868 --> 01:09:48.029]  Because of what we're doing.
[01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:52.193]  And we're non-violent, peaceful people who just want to save this country.
[01:09:52.754 --> 01:09:52.954]  Trey?
[01:09:54.525 --> 01:09:57.668]  You know, it comes in a lot and it's discouraging.
[01:09:57.828 --> 01:10:00.911]  I think they think we have a lot of alternative motives than what we really do.
[01:10:01.571 --> 01:10:04.494]  But we're really just out there doing what we say we're doing.
[01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:07.176]  I think people think... Most of that's intimidation.
[01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:08.117]  Yeah, you know.
[01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:10.338]  It's just bad people doing it.
[01:10:11.259 --> 01:10:20.807]  But the point is here that regardless if you like Alex Jones or hate Alex Jones or hate Ron Paul or love Ron Paul
[01:10:23.158 --> 01:10:34.503]  The point is, there is a concerted effort to say, arrest people that protest, don't allow demonstrations, because demonstrators are stopping a war that's to beat the terrorists, and therefore if you stop the war, you're with the terrorists.
[01:10:34.963 --> 01:10:35.924]  I mean, that's Democrats.
[01:10:35.944 --> 01:10:37.764]  That was the Deputy Attorney General back in 2003.
[01:10:37.985 --> 01:10:42.166]  He said no protest allowed anywhere in the state of California.
[01:10:42.667 --> 01:10:44.407]  The state was banning demonstrations.
[01:10:44.567 --> 01:10:52.551]  That was in the... He was quoted on television, and it was also in the Oakland Tribune, Oakland Herald.
[01:10:54.395 --> 01:10:59.443]  People being arrested for anti-war shirts on a parade route where Bush is driving, saying, well, that's a demonstration.
[01:11:00.104 --> 01:11:02.608]  You can be here for Bush, but you can't be here against Bush.
[01:11:03.389 --> 01:11:05.813]  Bill Clinton did similar things like that, but it's now accelerated.
[01:11:06.443 --> 01:11:07.503]  This is about freedom.
[01:11:07.583 --> 01:11:08.703]  I'm an American citizen.
[01:11:09.124 --> 01:11:11.844]  I have a right to say I'm against this war.
[01:11:12.324 --> 01:11:14.485]  I have a right to say I don't want to attack Iran.
[01:11:14.845 --> 01:11:16.825]  I have a right to go out and demonstrate.
[01:11:17.225 --> 01:11:19.946]  I have a right to talk about government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:11:20.326 --> 01:11:22.326]  I have a right to talk about how the Federal Reserve is private.
[01:11:22.566 --> 01:11:30.888]  I have a right to read North American Union SPP documents on air, and to read official United Nations calls 30 years ago, and they've now passed it, the U.S.
[01:11:30.908 --> 01:11:33.649]  just signed on Friday, for a global carbon tax.
[01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:35.789]  I'm telling you the truth.
[01:11:36.409 --> 01:11:44.692]  And I beg all the people listening across the nation who are driving along in their cars or tuning around the AM dial or FM dial, hearing me for the first time, I'm telling the truth.
[01:11:44.812 --> 01:11:47.073]  I've done the research and I've put my life on the line.
[01:11:47.653 --> 01:11:50.974]  And I've done this so you can wake up and so we can save this country and this world.
[01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:53.415]  America has been seized by the New World Order.
[01:11:53.975 --> 01:11:54.895]  People go, oh, what's that?
[01:11:55.076 --> 01:11:59.137]  I was on a big LA station last night and a guy said, why do you talk about imaginary New World Order?
[01:11:59.719 --> 01:12:03.421]  Your film Endgame's good, I saw it, but why do you talk about the New World Order?
[01:12:03.481 --> 01:12:05.282]  I go, well, Herbert Walker talked about it.
[01:12:05.562 --> 01:12:06.363]  Hitler talked about it.
[01:12:06.383 --> 01:12:08.044]  All these government documents talk about it.
[01:12:08.264 --> 01:12:09.184]  It's a world government!
[01:12:09.765 --> 01:12:19.010]  I mean, I've got mainstream news, CNN right here, where they say, and they have the quotes by the head of the UN saying, we have finally gotten a world tax.
[01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:25.673]  Just type in, to Google, World Carbon Tax.
[01:12:25.833 --> 01:12:26.674]  World Tax.
[01:12:27.987 --> 01:12:29.569]  World Tax for Greenhouse.
[01:12:29.889 --> 01:12:31.430]  Hundreds of mainstream articles.
[01:12:31.671 --> 01:12:35.334]  You'll be on the UN website reading the text of what they said Friday!
[01:12:35.354 --> 01:12:43.982]  I mean, I got CNN on video last week saying that the North American Union didn't exist, but also that the Trans-Texas Corridor doesn't exist.
[01:12:46.084 --> 01:12:51.589]  I mean, Giuliani is on the law firm that's doing that whole deal, handing over our existing roads.
[01:12:52.478 --> 01:12:55.900]  With a bunch of Mexican and Spanish and German lobbyists.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.961]  Just taking our roads and handing them over.
[01:12:58.441 --> 01:12:59.381]  This is about power.
[01:12:59.741 --> 01:13:04.304]  Big money comes in, they buy off the government, they have the government hand everything over to them.
[01:13:04.364 --> 01:13:06.485]  It's like third world nations being looted.
[01:13:07.085 --> 01:13:10.827]  Joseph Stiklitz, quit the World Bank, chief economist, 2002.
[01:13:11.047 --> 01:13:12.407]  Thousands of pages were released.
[01:13:14.608 --> 01:13:18.390]  Just type World Bank documents consume Argentina into Google, you'll get the actual documents.
[01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:19.911]  And the news articles about it.
[01:13:20.675 --> 01:13:22.496]  And they said they wanted to come into the U.S.
[01:13:22.636 --> 01:13:27.220]  and the third world, but do like what they've done in the third world and the U.S.
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:34.805]  and jack up inflation, destroy the dollar, blow out the economy, get you in debt, so they can come in and buy up the infrastructure.
[01:13:34.965 --> 01:13:46.293]  When they make the dollar as worthless as toilet paper, they can come in here with their foreign currencies that they just print up out of nowhere, too, and buy up all the ports, buy up all the water, buy up all the infrastructure, buy up all the roads.
[01:13:47.222 --> 01:14:05.011]  For pennies on the dollar, the government is engaged in crime handing them over, and I look at these well-oiled, clothed hair guys in suits, these neocon talk show hosts, these liberal talk show hosts, their establishment hacks working both sides like carnival barkers, from both ends, conning you, manipulating you.
[01:14:06.471 --> 01:14:08.212]  I don't think you have any idea what it's like.
[01:14:08.732 --> 01:14:16.236]  And again, I've never said this, I've never come out, I've said pray for me before, but I've always had a good instinct for things.
[01:14:17.188 --> 01:14:18.108]  Pray for Ron Paul.
[01:14:19.028 --> 01:14:20.249]  But even people in our own movement.
[01:14:22.129 --> 01:14:28.031]  Most of them are, not the grassroots, but most people that are, quote, prominent are just driven with insane jealousy of me.
[01:14:28.091 --> 01:14:28.311]  Why?
[01:14:28.371 --> 01:14:30.471]  Because I worked till 2 in the morning last night?
[01:14:30.911 --> 01:14:32.872]  Because I have a passion to fight this tyranny?
[01:14:32.892 --> 01:14:35.612]  No, I deserve support.
[01:14:35.752 --> 01:14:38.453]  I deserve people to support me after everything I've done.
[01:14:38.773 --> 01:14:40.754]  After 13 years of total commitment.
[01:14:41.574 --> 01:14:45.975]  Nine years ago now, walking outside the TV station after I've been told to shut up over and over again.
[01:14:46.977 --> 01:14:58.605]  After guys had pulled up in high and tight haircuts and gotten out of their car and with government plates and said, yeah, we're special forces, yeah, we're with the local martial law crew, when it all comes down, now that's all public, and you better shut your mouth.
[01:14:59.265 --> 01:15:00.706]  I told them, go to you know where.
[01:15:01.107 --> 01:15:07.111]  They got in their car and a few weeks later, four guys with hoods over their heads tried to beat the living hell out of me and I looked like something out of Cape Fear.
[01:15:07.571 --> 01:15:08.772]  I got good old boy guts.
[01:15:08.792 --> 01:15:14.496]  And as soon as they got my blood flying, as soon as they hurt me, I turned it on and I rammed their heads in the concrete.
[01:15:14.736 --> 01:15:16.097]  And I kicked them and I stomped them.
[01:15:17.165 --> 01:15:19.266]  It freaked him out as my blood ran all over him!
[01:15:20.487 --> 01:15:22.188]  I'm committed to the United States!
[01:15:22.488 --> 01:15:24.329]  I'm committed to defending this Republic!
[01:15:24.569 --> 01:15:25.129]  I'm committed 110%!
[01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:28.171]  I do this for the right reasons!
[01:15:28.711 --> 01:15:34.655]  And how dare Neil Gorsh and Rush Limbaugh and Nedved and others like Nedved calling for my arrest!
[01:15:34.975 --> 01:15:36.736]  That's hot treason against the Republic!
[01:15:36.976 --> 01:15:38.417]  He's the one engaged in treason!
[01:15:39.159 --> 01:15:39.999]  How dare them!
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:44.122]  We shall go on to the end, no matter what the cost is!
[01:15:44.242 --> 01:15:46.823]  We shall go on to the end, we shall never surrender!
[01:15:46.943 --> 01:15:47.963]  We'll be back with your car!
[01:15:48.344 --> 01:15:53.646]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:15:53.846 --> 01:15:55.907]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:15:56.148 --> 01:16:03.131]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded, and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:16:03.431 --> 01:16:03.672]  I think?
[01:16:18.148 --> 01:16:18.728]  We're good to go!
[01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:52.438]  In this jungle called life, only the tiger survives.
[01:16:52.918 --> 01:16:57.499]  So says the armchair survivalist Kurt Wilson, owner of Survival Enterprises.
[01:16:57.959 --> 01:17:10.261]  Kurt talks common sense about food storage, health care, firearms and weaponry, security, urban and wilderness survival techniques, and the simple things we can all do to help us and our loved ones survive when bad times hit.
[01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:14.022]  Learn to be one step ahead of the crowd in everyday situations.
[01:17:14.462 --> 01:17:24.308]  The Armchair Survivalist is geared for the rest of us who don't have unlimited funds to buy land, a cabin, build a bunker, or buy all the expensive survival supplies that would come in handy.
[01:17:24.508 --> 01:17:26.870]  He shows you how to work smarter, not harder.
[01:17:27.090 --> 01:17:31.113]  For over 25 years, Kurt has been helping people prepare for hard times.
[01:17:31.393 --> 01:17:40.879]  The Armchair Survivalist is sure to be an informative, entertaining, and educational talk show with Kurt not only sharing his vast level of survival knowledge, but taking your calls as well.
[01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:43.759]  We're good to go.
[01:17:58.058 --> 01:17:58.538]  We're good to go.
[01:18:25.563 --> 01:18:25.863]  I think so.
[01:18:48.032 --> 01:18:49.713]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[01:18:49.994 --> 01:18:51.675]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[01:18:51.875 --> 01:18:55.878]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[01:18:56.079 --> 01:18:59.141]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[01:18:59.321 --> 01:19:03.144]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[01:19:03.284 --> 01:19:05.686]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[01:19:05.806 --> 01:19:09.049]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices.
[01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.449]  That's right.
[01:19:38.479 --> 01:19:39.659]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:19:39.679 --> 01:19:41.500]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:20:04.086 --> 01:20:09.109]  When we last visited with our next guest, Heather Veach, she had started a Christian mission and outreach
[01:20:27.543 --> 01:20:30.044]  To strippers in Southern California.
[01:20:30.104 --> 01:20:31.705]  She had been in that business herself.
[01:20:31.765 --> 01:20:39.669]  She was now touring strip clubs in California, not to dance, but to try to change the lives of some of the people she found there.
[01:20:40.089 --> 01:20:47.292]  Going so far as to buy lap dances, and then instead of having a dance, asking the women if they'd like to talk about faith.
[01:20:47.752 --> 01:20:50.974]  Some saying yes, most saying yes, some saying no.
[01:20:51.274 --> 01:20:55.616]  This is a pretty gutsy enterprise, and Heather Veach, we thank you for joining us again.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.861]  Well, thank you for having me back.
[01:20:58.501 --> 01:21:00.262]  Heather, you're now in Las Vegas.
[01:21:00.462 --> 01:21:03.944]  Is that a more fertile territory for your efforts?
[01:21:04.725 --> 01:21:06.165]  Oh, well, definitely.
[01:21:06.366 --> 01:21:12.229]  In fact, you know, it's so much more out here as well.
[01:21:12.249 --> 01:21:22.434]  You know, I never thought that God would use me more than strippers or porn stars because I reach out to them, but now I'm also dealing on a daily basis with prostitutes.
[01:21:23.355 --> 01:21:24.315]  So it's really...
[01:21:25.785 --> 01:21:29.228]  You know, the sex industry as a whole, the women in the sex industry.
[01:21:30.009 --> 01:21:40.820]  Now, the sex industry, I think when we last talked you were about to go to a convention of the adult video people out there in Las Vegas and you did go and there was a little attention.
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:46.265]  There was nothing, nobody tried to stop you from the industry, right?
[01:21:46.949 --> 01:21:54.691]  No, absolutely not, and you know what's so great is they're actually very welcoming to me now.
[01:21:54.791 --> 01:22:02.733]  You know, I did a booth two years in a row, and this is the year, it's coming up in January, and I won't have a booth.
[01:22:02.853 --> 01:22:11.995]  And it's so cute because they, you know, contact me, am I sure I don't want a booth, and they're just very, very good to me, very welcoming.
[01:22:13.781 --> 01:22:14.862]  Why do you think that is?
[01:22:14.962 --> 01:22:28.432]  Because they themselves understand that there are some people, at least they would concede, some people who shouldn't be in this business, who find themselves in it anyway, and if you're going to talk to them and get them to do something else, that's okay?
[01:22:28.472 --> 01:22:35.417]  I think that's actually it, but you know, I think that people don't realize that everybody on the face of the planet really wants to be loved.
[01:22:36.238 --> 01:22:47.789]  And the fact that someone's willing to come in and love them and show them respect and love even though they're in that place in life and offer them an opportunity to have change if they want change.
[01:22:47.929 --> 01:22:52.393]  But even still, if they don't change, I have made a commitment to love them.
[01:22:53.095 --> 01:23:00.702]  So having someone that comes in that, you know, is on the opposite side of... I would be on the opposite side to them, you know.
[01:23:00.722 --> 01:23:01.143]  Sure.
[01:23:02.184 --> 01:23:10.332]  And that comes in and loves them, shakes their hand, hugs them, looks at them with respect and treats them differently than the rest of the world.
[01:23:11.343 --> 01:23:13.503]  I think to them this is a positive thing.
[01:23:13.543 --> 01:23:13.863]  Sure.
[01:23:14.124 --> 01:23:19.264]  And you still will say to people, you don't have to get out of the business you're in.
[01:23:19.304 --> 01:23:20.405]  You're still welcome.
[01:23:20.565 --> 01:23:21.565]  I'm still going to talk to you.
[01:23:21.585 --> 01:23:22.965]  You're still welcome in a church.
[01:23:24.005 --> 01:23:24.785]  Exactly.
[01:23:24.985 --> 01:23:33.547]  You know, it's one of the biggest things I'm criticized for, but you know, I tell people, for one, I want people to go into church, find out about God.
[01:23:33.987 --> 01:23:37.528]  You know, when I gave my life to God, it was almost like a marriage.
[01:23:37.668 --> 01:23:39.368]  I fully committed my life to God.
[01:23:39.788 --> 01:23:46.399]  So why would someone commit their life, quit their job, do all these things for a God they don't even know?
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:53.470]  So I want to give them the opportunity to at least come in and find out who this God that I'm in love with is.
[01:23:54.845 --> 01:24:10.269]  One of the things that we talked about briefly about a year ago and it came up again as I was discussing what we're going to be doing on this program with some of the women who work in this office building and when they looked at your homepage on MySpace
[01:24:11.730 --> 01:24:18.533]  They still say, wow, you know, that picture or some of the pictures could be viewed as provocative.
[01:24:19.274 --> 01:24:21.135]  They might generate lust.
[01:24:21.455 --> 01:24:27.918]  Jimmy Carter, of course, got in a lot of trouble for admitting that he had a lot of lust in his heart that he didn't do anything with, but have it.
[01:24:28.959 --> 01:24:30.180]  You get friend requests.
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:35.863]  I mean, how do you deal with the fact that you're a very attractive woman who's engaged in this ministry?
[01:24:36.444 --> 01:24:43.862]  But where friends, I use that word advisedly, are going to ask to be your friends on MySpace, I mean, how do you know what their motives are?
[01:24:44.682 --> 01:24:58.055]  Well you know my MySpace is definitely an outreach tool and even so much that I have a disclaimer on it that says this is not for Christians because I do acknowledge that a lot of my top friends can cause lust.
[01:24:58.275 --> 01:25:08.025]  I know that myself I try to make sure it's mostly my face, pictures of my face, and you know a lot of people think you know want to want to think about that being lustful but
[01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:12.263]  I tell people, you know, where are we?
[01:25:12.403 --> 01:25:13.303]  Are we Muslim?
[01:25:13.323 --> 01:25:18.265]  Do I need to cover my face because people find it beautiful or attracted to it?
[01:25:18.425 --> 01:25:18.725]  No!
[01:25:18.865 --> 01:25:27.249]  For one, you know, I think that the devil uses advertising very well and lures people in with all kinds of things.
[01:25:27.529 --> 01:25:31.851]  And in the Bible, beauty has been used for a good purpose.
[01:25:32.492 --> 01:25:41.315]  You know, in the Bible, Esther saved the whole Jewish race, strictly by her beauty, because the king took notice of her.
[01:25:41.995 --> 01:25:49.898]  And for me, to have someone stop and say, well, this girl is beautiful, and then read further into, and she belongs to God,
[01:25:50.718 --> 01:25:53.741]  And she believes in doing something right, something different.
[01:25:53.821 --> 01:25:59.226]  She's not using her beauty for sexual, but she's using it to advertise God.
[01:25:59.946 --> 01:26:05.551]  And you know, I think it's just a fine line of making sure that I'm not advertising something sexual.
[01:26:05.952 --> 01:26:17.442]  Now, the girls on my top list, those are my friends, and 99% of the girls that I have on my front page are girls I'm actually in relationship with.
[01:26:18.150 --> 01:26:18.671]  I think so.
[01:26:42.334 --> 01:26:46.857]  No, I think that's certainly an understatement of the day, if not the year.
[01:26:46.877 --> 01:27:03.406]  I mean, there's plenty of other stuff that people could go to, and as you say, you do have a kind of disclaimer that says, you know, if you're, I don't want to insult anybody, but if you're the traditional church lady who just likes to bake cookies and talk with her friends, this probably isn't the site for her.
[01:27:03.426 --> 01:27:04.906]  Correct.
[01:27:05.207 --> 01:27:09.269]  What do you, how do you count a success?
[01:27:09.749 --> 01:27:11.590]  Some people leave an industry, but
[01:27:12.113 --> 01:27:19.986]  Do you keep close enough connections to them to know what they're doing next?
[01:27:20.687 --> 01:27:22.790]  You know what I count as success?
[01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:26.416]  I count, number one, if they develop a relationship with Christ.
[01:27:27.133 --> 01:27:33.756]  Because to me, a lot of people want me to address what they're wearing, their job, different things like that.
[01:27:34.076 --> 01:27:41.680]  As I see it, there's a sinking ship and there's a lot of furniture on the ship, but the ship is sinking.
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:51.404]  Now I could go around trying to fix the furniture and arrange it, or I can go down and patch the hole causing the ship to sink.
[01:27:52.199 --> 01:28:05.627]  So if I know that the patch is being put in, and that here we're fixing this problem that is causing it, because you know, the actions of people usually are not the problem.
[01:28:06.248 --> 01:28:07.869]  That's a result of a problem.
[01:28:07.889 --> 01:28:09.149]  And that's an excellent point.
[01:28:09.169 --> 01:28:17.755]  So to me, if I could see that they're starting a relationship with Christ, they're in church, they're getting a foundation, people that care about them, things like that, that's a success to me.
[01:28:18.315 --> 01:28:21.057]  And I just pray and hope that they continue on.
[01:28:22.466 --> 01:28:27.008]  You were on Pat Robertson's 700 Club a number of times when we last talked.
[01:28:27.048 --> 01:28:33.251]  You said there are sometimes some of the folks on the so-called religious right don't like what you're doing.
[01:28:33.311 --> 01:28:41.294]  Have they continued though to be friendly with you at least from the 700 Club side of it or have they kind of lost interest in you?
[01:28:42.255 --> 01:28:45.696]  You know it's funny I still have a good Christian base.
[01:28:45.916 --> 01:28:50.058]  I think that a lot of times I definitely shake it up but I
[01:28:51.158 --> 01:28:53.379]  You know, I had to make a decision.
[01:28:53.399 --> 01:29:00.182]  I'm either going to do things to actually reach the people I'm going to reach, or I'm going to do things to reach Christians.
[01:29:01.282 --> 01:29:07.125]  And the truth is, you know, my goal is not to impress Christians.
[01:29:07.685 --> 01:29:09.386]  I'm thankful that they're there for me.
[01:29:09.446 --> 01:29:11.107]  I'm thankful that they pray for me.
[01:29:11.547 --> 01:29:16.569]  But if they all abandon me, but people are still coming to know Christ, I'm okay with that.
[01:29:16.949 --> 01:29:21.792]  Listen, that's a wonderful way to end the conversation.
[01:29:21.952 --> 01:29:36.401]  I do appreciate you coming back with us, catching us up to date, and explaining that you're doing what you're doing out of principle, not because some cause group behind you says do it or don't do it, because this is the way your convictions carry you.
[01:29:36.461 --> 01:29:43.365]  When we come back, I'll look at our last guest, whose principles have made a huge difference in 2007.
[01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:45.706]  We'll be back for more Culture Shots.
[01:29:45.907 --> 01:29:46.567]  I'm Barry Lynn.
[01:29:49.523 --> 01:29:58.588]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:29:58.848 --> 01:30:10.054]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:30:10.394 --> 01:30:16.117]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:30:16.277 --> 01:30:16.677]  I think so.
[01:30:34.155 --> 01:30:34.415]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:30:34.455 --> 01:30:40.098]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[01:30:40.218 --> 01:30:45.600]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[01:31:01.915 --> 01:31:05.156]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[01:31:05.817 --> 01:31:09.098]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[01:31:09.718 --> 01:31:13.100]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy, and foolish.
[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:18.202]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[01:31:18.922 --> 01:31:20.903]  We will still have two regrets.
[01:31:21.543 --> 01:31:24.884]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[01:31:25.565 --> 01:31:28.426]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[01:31:29.221 --> 01:31:36.083]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[01:31:36.103 --> 01:31:37.104]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:37.124 --> 01:31:38.224]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:38.244 --> 01:31:38.284]  800-409-5633.
[01:31:48.698 --> 01:31:49.359]  It's a fact.
[01:31:49.579 --> 01:31:57.064]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:31:57.184 --> 01:32:06.050]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:16.857]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:32:17.097 --> 01:32:17.578]  We're good to go.
[01:32:35.993 --> 01:32:36.514]  I don't know.
[01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:53.775]  Let Sears keep you warm this winter with a new Carrier or Kenmore heating system from a name you can trust.

[01:33:30.589 --> 01:33:32.689]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:33.349]  Well, search no more!
[01:33:33.369 --> 01:33:34.810]  We are the GCN Radio Network!
[01:34:01.334 --> 01:34:12.824]  Well, in five hours, probably midnight, Eastern Standard Time, we'll find out how much the Boston Tea Party, RonPaul2008.com Money Bomb brought in.
[01:34:12.884 --> 01:34:17.848]  We'll have continual reports at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com on all of it.
[01:34:17.868 --> 01:34:18.889]  By the way, when this show ends,
[01:34:21.016 --> 01:34:29.385]  On all my syndicated stations and shortwave internet out there, you'll be able to go to InfoWars.com and here are the two hours re-aired any time you want.
[01:34:29.405 --> 01:34:31.147]  It'll be sent out to you on the podcast.
[01:34:31.187 --> 01:34:33.189]  We cover a lot in the last two hours.
[01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:36.373]  I want to go to your phone calls, but if you just type into Google,
[01:34:37.876 --> 01:34:49.600]  Global Carbon Tax, and click web or click news, hundreds of articles, mainstream, with headlines like, UN considering Global Carbon Tax, calling for Global Carbon Tax.
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:54.121]  They just got the US to sign on to this, and you'll hear what life under this will be like.
[01:34:54.141 --> 01:34:57.883]  You can read the actual quotes and the documents by the United Nations.
[01:34:58.523 --> 01:35:01.844]  From mainstream news and proponents, people supporting it.
[01:35:01.984 --> 01:35:02.964]  Remember, none of this existed.
[01:35:03.184 --> 01:35:04.985]  They deny it exists until they launch it.
[01:35:05.538 --> 01:35:06.278]  Here's CNN.
[01:35:06.298 --> 01:35:07.178]  In a U-turn, the U.S.
[01:35:07.218 --> 01:35:08.659]  agrees to a global warming deal.
[01:35:09.259 --> 01:35:18.660]  In a dramatic reversal Saturday, the United States rejected, then accepted, a compromise to set the stage for intense negotiations in the next two years aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions worldwide.
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.041]  No, they agreed to an agreement to set up the taxes.
[01:35:22.361 --> 01:35:23.341]  This gives me a stomachache.
[01:35:23.361 --> 01:35:24.842]  I actually just got a horrible stomachache.
[01:35:24.882 --> 01:35:27.582]  It makes me sick to see this happening.
[01:35:27.602 --> 01:35:28.402]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[01:35:28.422 --> 01:35:29.282]  You've been holding long enough.
[01:35:29.342 --> 01:35:30.383]  Tom in Florida.
[01:35:30.623 --> 01:35:31.683]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:35:31.703 --> 01:35:32.223]  Go ahead, Tom.
[01:35:33.065 --> 01:35:39.228]  Yeah, I'm calling back to say thanks for having me on your show Wednesday about Victor Bean and the gun shows here.
[01:35:39.469 --> 01:35:41.209]  Yes, but last Sunday we talked about it too.
[01:35:41.229 --> 01:35:44.331]  It was confirmed that they're basically censoring Ron Paul supporters from them.
[01:35:45.292 --> 01:35:49.814]  I just would like, if I can, to give out the contact numbers for Victor Bean so people can call.
[01:35:49.974 --> 01:35:52.836]  Listen, I really think it's a waste of time, brother, and I'm not mad at you.
[01:35:52.856 --> 01:35:53.796]  I just got to move quick.
[01:35:54.116 --> 01:35:56.137]  You know, some gun show, it's a private property.
[01:35:56.578 --> 01:36:00.960]  If he wants to restrict people and keep them from getting tables and doing all that, I'm sorry they did it to you.
[01:36:01.869 --> 01:36:03.051]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:36:03.071 --> 01:36:05.014]  I just want to say you made a great difference in my life.
[01:36:16.434 --> 01:36:22.598]  You know, one thing I was able to tell my family and friends before the war that there wasn't any weapons of mass destruction.
[01:36:22.638 --> 01:36:26.480]  And they weren't going to leave and they were going to break it in three parts because it was all in official Pentagon plans.
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:27.080]  Exactly.
[01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:30.902]  And then when it all came out that there weren't any weapons, they had to finally admit it.
[01:36:30.962 --> 01:36:32.924]  I mean, it just gave me so much credibility.
[01:36:32.964 --> 01:36:34.645]  But I was able... So I want to thank you for that.
[01:36:34.765 --> 01:36:40.568]  I was also calm because there was another caller that was concerned about 9-11 and Ron Paul and his stance.
[01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:45.651]  I mean, he's already said that he is in favor of a new investigation if the American people want it.
[01:36:46.258 --> 01:36:54.203]  And, uh, you know, if we get a new investigation and, you know, it comes out like we believe that 9-11 is an inside job, I mean, heads are going to roll.
[01:36:54.223 --> 01:36:55.704]  People are going to be held accountable.
[01:36:56.165 --> 01:37:00.768]  Well, it's come out that hundreds of other staged attacks, for listeners that don't know, it's available.
[01:37:00.808 --> 01:37:01.288]  It's public.
[01:37:01.328 --> 01:37:03.489]  Thank you so much, sir, for the call.
[01:37:03.850 --> 01:37:05.231]  Let's go ahead and talk to T.J.
[01:37:05.331 --> 01:37:05.911]  in New York.
[01:37:05.951 --> 01:37:07.012]  T.J., you're on the air.
[01:37:07.032 --> 01:37:08.293]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:37:08.353 --> 01:37:08.653]  Good, sir.
[01:37:09.273 --> 01:37:11.255]  As you can recall, I'll give you congratulations on Endgame.
[01:37:11.275 --> 01:37:12.076]  It's an awesome film.
[01:37:12.317 --> 01:37:12.717]  Thank you.
[01:37:13.157 --> 01:37:17.482]  And to also say, every time the elections come up, all I hear from people is that we need change and we have to have change.
[01:37:17.522 --> 01:37:21.847]  And even though it's preaching to the choir on your radio station, Ron Paul is that change that we need.
[01:37:22.447 --> 01:37:23.108]  Well, it is.
[01:37:23.448 --> 01:37:26.992]  And there's hundreds of thousands listening right now who've heard the show for the first time, sir.
[01:37:27.913 --> 01:37:29.194]  So you're not preaching to the choir, A.
[01:37:31.563 --> 01:37:34.505]  All the other candidates, you know, people try to pick candidates on who they think is going to win.
[01:37:34.565 --> 01:37:36.787]  Like, you know, people are fans of a football team when they're winning.
[01:37:37.087 --> 01:37:41.270]  Folks, you need to be fans of people who have the right stance, and who are constitutionalists.
[01:37:42.431 --> 01:37:47.734]  Everybody needs to get behind Ron Paul, not only to support him now, but make sure they get out there, come vote time, and place your vote for Ron Paul.
[01:37:48.074 --> 01:37:48.695]  Absolutely.
[01:37:48.835 --> 01:37:53.078]  Not only are the neocons and fake liberals all attacking Ron Paul, showing you he's the man right now.
[01:37:54.319 --> 01:37:56.280]  They are saying his supporters are terrorists.
[01:37:56.781 --> 01:37:58.963]  Just out of the blue, they're just saying it on CNN and Fox.
[01:37:59.424 --> 01:38:00.505]  Off of talking points.
[01:38:00.545 --> 01:38:01.166]  That's the thing.
[01:38:01.366 --> 01:38:03.048]  They're saying the exact same thing.
[01:38:03.868 --> 01:38:05.410]  You realize how dangerous that is?
[01:38:05.770 --> 01:38:10.295]  When the media teams up with the government and says, arrest people, torture's good, no free speech.
[01:38:11.696 --> 01:38:12.597]  You're gonna have trouble though.
[01:38:12.637 --> 01:38:14.079]  Americans know they've at least got that.
[01:38:14.099 --> 01:38:15.680]  You're not gonna be able to tell them that never existed.
[01:38:16.361 --> 01:38:18.363]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Oregon.
[01:38:18.663 --> 01:38:19.404]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:38:19.424 --> 01:38:20.025]  Thanks for calling.
[01:38:20.729 --> 01:38:30.672]  Yeah, we're on the run rate of about $350,000 an hour on your Ron Paul, and that gives about $6.2 million.
[01:38:30.692 --> 01:38:36.254]  So, we need to ramp it up just a little bit to break the fundraising record.
[01:38:36.854 --> 01:38:43.936]  What would be neat on the Ron Paul site if you could put how much money was raised in the last hour, because that velocity counts for a lot.
[01:38:44.116 --> 01:38:47.317]  Well, I know this, and I'm not saying we did it, but it was moving about
[01:38:47.977 --> 01:38:56.344]  I don't know, you know, 20 grand or so every 10 minutes, and then we did, the caller had the idea to have everybody launch at one point, and it was over 150 grand in 10 minutes.
[01:38:56.384 --> 01:38:57.145]  I wonder what did that?
[01:38:57.445 --> 01:39:04.311]  Yeah, the last one I measured was in 15 minutes, the run rate was $380,000 for the full hour.
[01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:05.052]  Yeah.
[01:39:05.152 --> 01:39:07.974]  If you could raise $1,000,000 in one hour, that would make history.
[01:39:08.014 --> 01:39:11.938]  Yeah, in the first hour last night, he raised $500,000, but then you have the overnight hours.
[01:39:12.538 --> 01:39:19.102]  When Lyman and I brainstormed on-air, when he had first come up with this idea, I was saying two days.
[01:39:19.402 --> 01:39:21.523]  Try to raise $10 million in two days with a big ramp-up.
[01:39:21.923 --> 01:39:23.124]  And the campaign agreed with me.
[01:39:23.184 --> 01:39:31.348]  And on-air, Ron Paul on-air, Jesse Benton, the communications man, agreed that he thought that was better.
[01:39:31.408 --> 01:39:32.889]  But hey, we're not going to tell the grassroots what to do.
[01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.529]  Try it.
[01:39:33.589 --> 01:39:34.450]  Just do it now.
[01:39:35.110 --> 01:39:38.472]  If you've already maxed out, got friends and family believing Ron Paul, they forgot about him, call him.
[01:39:39.769 --> 01:39:44.657]  If you want somebody to articulate this message to them, tell them to go to Infowars.com and listen to the repeat of this show coming up.
[01:39:44.737 --> 01:39:45.759]  I'll explain it all to them.
[01:39:46.903 --> 01:39:48.324]  That's just in a few minutes.
[01:39:48.364 --> 01:39:50.466]  Let us now go ahead and talk to Eric in Michigan.
[01:39:50.486 --> 01:39:51.026]  You're on the air.
[01:39:51.047 --> 01:39:51.787]  Thanks for holding, Eric.
[01:39:52.187 --> 01:39:53.749]  Alex, it's great to be with you.
[01:39:53.949 --> 01:40:02.976]  I've been listening for quite a while, and I've been a Prison Planet TV member for about six months, and it's been odd to be with you fighting on the front line on Tea Party.
[01:40:03.136 --> 01:40:10.923]  So, I just want to say real quick, I'm the webmaster for a new project, which is actually a Ron Paul 2008 calendar, and I wanted to plug that real quick.
[01:40:11.163 --> 01:40:11.423]  Good.
[01:40:11.764 --> 01:40:12.064]  What else?
[01:40:12.604 --> 01:40:14.845]  Uh, yeah, it's called Hotties for Ron Paul.
[01:40:15.005 --> 01:40:20.108]  Hotties for Ron, number four, hottiesforronpaul.com.
[01:40:20.888 --> 01:40:21.809]  Check it out.
[01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:24.070]  If you Google Ron Paul calendar, it's number two.
[01:40:24.090 --> 01:40:31.614]  If you want to see some attractive women supporting Ron Paul, it's a 13-month calendar.
[01:40:31.694 --> 01:40:32.995]  It's $11.99 for plus $80.
[01:40:33.395 --> 01:40:35.336]  It's $11.99 for the calendar.
[01:40:35.816 --> 01:40:36.356]  I hear you, bro.
[01:40:36.396 --> 01:40:37.297]  I appreciate your call.
[01:40:38.538 --> 01:40:40.782]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[01:40:40.802 --> 01:40:42.965]  Let's talk to Keith in Kentucky.
[01:40:43.026 --> 01:40:43.827]  Keith, you're on the air.
[01:40:43.847 --> 01:40:44.227]  Go ahead.
[01:40:44.989 --> 01:40:45.730]  Alex, how you doing?
[01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:50.337]  I'm a first-time caller, but I listen to your show on occasion, and I agree with about 85% of what you say.
[01:40:51.917 --> 01:40:59.842]  By the way, he has said that, but some of the biggest Ron Paul sites out there will not allow it to be discussed and basically say it isn't true.
[01:41:11.495 --> 01:41:21.418]  Well, I'm an in-closet conspiracy theorist, and I guarantee you that if they don't kill him, they will definitely do whatever it takes to end his ability to help to run a strong campaign.
[01:41:21.518 --> 01:41:22.578]  Well, look, I'll say this, sir.
[01:41:23.878 --> 01:41:25.679]  I brought that up three months ago to Ron Paul.
[01:41:25.719 --> 01:41:27.720]  You can go to the story about Daniel Esterlin.
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.900]  Elita's consider assassinating Ron Paul.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:32.041]  TopInfoWorks.com.
[01:41:33.121 --> 01:41:34.461]  And you can go hear Esterlin.
[01:41:34.481 --> 01:41:36.142]  You can also go hear Ron Paul three months ago.
[01:41:36.842 --> 01:41:40.323]  And I brought this up to him, and he said, yeah, they kill people all the time, and yeah, we get big enough, let's try.
[01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:43.836]  But the tree of liberty is water with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[01:41:44.654 --> 01:41:46.736]  And sometimes you just have to do what you have to do.
[01:41:47.236 --> 01:41:56.222]  Now, if we talk about how they could kill him, and if we talk about how we've got intel that they're discussing it, and they're trying to decide, would this hurt them, what would happen if they did, then they won't do it.
[01:41:56.703 --> 01:42:03.888]  But if we say, oh, that's a conspiracy, even though Ron Paul says it's a possibility, and keep ourselves in that box, then we're in deep trouble.
[01:42:04.148 --> 01:42:04.348]  Okay?
[01:42:04.368 --> 01:42:05.169]  It's that simple.
[01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:06.970]  Let's race through calls here.
[01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:11.013]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Ohio.
[01:42:11.233 --> 01:42:12.334]  You're on the air, Dave, go ahead.
[01:42:13.317 --> 01:42:13.957]  Hi, Alex.
[01:42:13.977 --> 01:42:18.479]  Isn't this really about the sovereignty of the United States of America?
[01:42:18.559 --> 01:42:21.680]  I mean, when were we no longer a sovereign nation?
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:24.661]  When did the WTO have more authority over our trade than Congress?
[01:42:24.841 --> 01:42:25.882]  That's global government!
[01:42:26.022 --> 01:42:26.502]  We're in it!
[01:42:26.642 --> 01:42:28.503]  And now the WTO gets the U.S.
[01:42:28.523 --> 01:42:31.284]  to sign on to a global carbon tax, to fund the U.N.
[01:42:31.484 --> 01:42:32.224]  You think the U.N.'
[01:42:32.204 --> 01:42:33.104]  's bad now, folks?
[01:42:33.324 --> 01:42:34.065]  It's getting teeth.
[01:42:34.145 --> 01:42:34.585]  Trillions.
[01:42:36.966 --> 01:42:40.387]  And all the regulatory control, all of it, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:42:40.447 --> 01:42:42.348]  Steve in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:42:42.388 --> 01:42:42.988]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:42:43.761 --> 01:42:44.401]  Yes, Alex.
[01:42:44.562 --> 01:42:50.805]  On November 5th I heard your show and you were talking about how important it was to donate to the Ron Paul campaign.
[01:42:50.825 --> 01:42:53.427]  I've never donated to a presidential campaign.
[01:42:54.888 --> 01:42:57.729]  This is the first campaign I've donated to.
[01:42:57.749 --> 01:42:59.630]  I haven't even voted in five years.
[01:43:00.511 --> 01:43:05.354]  And I donated $100 and this time I've donated the maximum amount.
[01:43:05.374 --> 01:43:10.737]  I gave in $2,000 and now I'm at the maximum.
[01:43:10.877 --> 01:43:12.498]  We'll actually give $200 more, but good job.
[01:43:12.518 --> 01:43:12.798]  Go ahead.
[01:43:14.263 --> 01:43:17.144]  Yeah, I gave $200 on another.
[01:43:17.564 --> 01:43:29.207]  And I gave $2,000 today, and I want to personally thank you for doing it, for encouraging people to donate, because you, you put me over the edge.
[01:43:29.247 --> 01:43:38.810]  I was thinking about it, but it was what you had said that had inspired me to get out and donate.
[01:43:39.110 --> 01:43:39.790]  God bless you, sir.
[01:43:39.810 --> 01:43:41.351]  Call me back tomorrow, and I'm live at 11 to 2.
[01:43:41.391 --> 01:43:42.971]  Let me just say this in the last minute we've got.
[01:43:44.236 --> 01:43:46.837]  Even if Ron Paul doesn't win, he injects real ideas.
[01:43:47.177 --> 01:43:49.978]  He wakes up other people to the freedom movement, the liberty movement.
[01:43:50.038 --> 01:43:50.498]  It's growing.
[01:43:50.518 --> 01:43:52.299]  Who would have ever thought we'd come this far this fast?
[01:43:52.359 --> 01:43:53.200]  We're going to win.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:57.261]  We have to first realize we're going to win, whether it's with Ron Paul or down the road.
[01:43:57.361 --> 01:43:59.782]  The collision of tyranny versus liberty is happening.
[01:43:59.802 --> 01:44:03.423]  That's why they've tried to put the cameras, the face scanners, the police state grid in place.
[01:44:03.644 --> 01:44:04.624]  But most cops are good.
[01:44:04.824 --> 01:44:06.265]  The majority of the military are good.
[01:44:06.485 --> 01:44:07.425]  They're good Americans.
[01:44:07.665 --> 01:44:08.766]  People worldwide are good.
[01:44:08.806 --> 01:44:09.806]  They don't want this tyranny.
[01:44:11.017 --> 01:44:13.838]  And so, it isn't win or lose.
[01:44:13.898 --> 01:44:14.758]  It's do the right thing.
[01:44:14.898 --> 01:44:15.618]  Justice be done.
[01:44:15.658 --> 01:44:16.598]  May the heavens fall.
[01:44:17.519 --> 01:44:18.239]  Duty is ours.
[01:44:18.299 --> 01:44:19.419]  Consequence belongs to God.
[01:44:19.799 --> 01:44:20.700]  Take action now.
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:22.240]  Get involved in history.
[01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:24.661]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, get fired up.
[01:44:24.701 --> 01:44:25.481]  Say you're mad at Seller.
[01:44:25.501 --> 01:44:26.421]  You're not going to take it anymore.

[01:45:14.984 --> 01:45:18.145]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:45:18.805 --> 01:45:25.266]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
