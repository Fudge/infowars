[00:00:04.858 --> 00:00:09.062]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.723 --> 00:00:10.523]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.284 --> 00:00:13.206]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:16.489]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.153]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:26.238]  Remember, remember the 5th of November.
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:42.067]  Well, in the last 12 hours, Eastern Time, over a million and a half dollars has been raised by the Ron Paul 2008 presidential campaign.
[00:00:42.548 --> 00:00:47.451]  That's just donations coming in over the internet that are confirmed by PayPal and credit card.
[00:00:49.236 --> 00:01:02.203]  Of course, that is close to a third of what he raised in the last quarter alone, and this is due to an internet grassroots campaign to raise $5 million by the 5th of November.
[00:01:02.584 --> 00:01:05.846]  What a victory to raise over a million and a half!
[00:01:06.506 --> 00:01:11.729]  And of course, the campaign is usually, with its computers, a few hours behind before they post the new numbers.
[00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:20.943]  So over $1,500,000 raised on this 5th of November, all started by people on the Internet.
[00:01:21.764 --> 00:01:23.864]  I intend to track down exactly who originated that.
[00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:28.185]  I know there's a couple sites, and getting them on, because we're living history here.
[00:01:28.225 --> 00:01:29.866]  We're living people taking action.
[00:01:30.326 --> 00:01:32.967]  The odds makers have slashed him from 100 to 1, 66 to 1.
[00:01:35.682 --> 00:01:57.598]  50 to 1, 12 to 1, 6 to 1, 3 to 1, depending on which bookie now you look at, he's 12, 6, and 3 to 1, depending on which of the big booking houses, and they've been very, very accurate in the past, and he has a trajectory, if it continues to grow, or they can't manufacture some type of slime to spray on him that the public will buy into,
[00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:11.481]  This great man of integrity that Ron Paul is set, barring chicanery with the electoral systems in the Republican primaries coming up, and now just 75 days or so they start.
[00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:17.703]  It's just amazing to see all of this starting to happen.
[00:02:17.743 --> 00:02:23.406]  So, that is some positive news for you on this 5th of November.
[00:02:24.838 --> 00:02:35.884]  I've already given to Ron Paul several times, and my giving has become somewhat of a national issue of great wickedness, supposedly, because I'm not a Chinese general or a cocaine dealer.
[00:02:35.904 --> 00:02:39.766]  If that was the case, it'd be okay, or the Saudi royal family would be okay.
[00:02:40.747 --> 00:02:42.248]  But I'm not, so it's not okay.
[00:02:42.288 --> 00:02:45.249]  I'm a born and bred American Texan, so that's not allowed.
[00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.232]  But I will be giving again today, and I'm going to challenge family.
[00:02:51.221 --> 00:03:03.279]  Uh, in phone calls during breaks, uh, I'm gonna work the telephones to try to raise at least $10,000 from six or seven members of my family for the Ron Paul campaign via PayPal.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.604]  When I get up here and I say I'm making a donation, I mean it.
[00:03:07.464 --> 00:03:08.984]  And it's important to make this point.
[00:03:09.304 --> 00:03:11.325]  A million and a half in one day is big.
[00:03:11.685 --> 00:03:13.946]  But what if this caught wildfire?
[00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:24.108]  What if a word got out on this today, while it's hot, while it's happening, and he's already raised over a million and a half, surging towards his goal of five million.
[00:03:24.128 --> 00:03:26.108]  What if he raises two, three, four, five million?
[00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:32.690]  Imagine what a shockwave that will send of grassroots contributions.
[00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:39.410]  So go to PrisonPlanet.com, big banner at the top, link through to RonPaul2008.com.
[00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:51.580]  Steve Watson's got an article coming out in the next hour or so about this 5th of November, and I hope you get that and blast it out from Infowars.net and PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[00:03:53.368 --> 00:04:00.069]  This is a very very important day and I again I commend the individuals out there that thought this up.
[00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.571]  It's an example of what individuals highly motivated reaching out and networking with other freedom lovers can do.
[00:04:06.591 --> 00:04:11.652]  I heard one talk show host this morning likening it to the Germans didn't put up much defense against Hitler.
[00:04:12.392 --> 00:04:22.294]  We the American people are putting up a major defense against the open wanton tyranny that they're trying to launch against the society and that's true.
[00:04:22.964 --> 00:04:36.768]  We were slow to rouse, but now the sleeping giant has wiped the sleep from its eyes, stuck its head in a cold bucket of ice water, and is now beginning to pump its face up red with wrath.
[00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.010]  So we will get into this and a lot more today.
[00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.511]  Very, very serious news on the world's biggest bank, Citigroup.
[00:04:46.594 --> 00:04:47.975]  Gyrating out of control.
[00:04:48.075 --> 00:04:49.977]  Major dollar plunge is continuing.
[00:04:50.057 --> 00:04:51.678]  Former NFL star.
[00:04:51.738 --> 00:04:54.301]  Latest to question 9-11 official story.
[00:04:54.801 --> 00:04:55.682]  And a lot more.
[00:04:55.742 --> 00:04:59.425]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:02.487]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.548 --> 00:05:04.589]  A new world order.
[00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.955]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by... It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:05:13.036 --> 00:05:15.218]  Both their objective be world domination.
[00:05:15.811 --> 00:05:18.213]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:18.974 --> 00:05:26.321]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:29.326 --> 00:05:34.310]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.253]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:38.633 --> 00:05:41.175]  Bill Burr is making great progress for the world government.
[00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:42.356]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:42.396 --> 00:05:43.136]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:44.237]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:44.437 --> 00:05:45.218]  They're after power.
[00:05:45.418 --> 00:05:46.439]  That's what they're after.

[00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:09.390]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:10.931]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:11.111 --> 00:07:14.594]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with CalVin Pure Soaps?

[00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:39.030]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.

[00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:07.763]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.383 --> 00:08:11.364]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:38.744]  Good evening, the mother.
[00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:43.966]  Allow me first to apologize for this... Your Majesty, shut up!
[00:08:44.026 --> 00:08:52.049]  I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of the everyday routine, the security of the familiar, the tranquility, the repentance.
[00:08:52.069 --> 00:08:53.810]  I enjoy them as much as any bloke.
[00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.491]  But in the spirit of commemoration... Who's that woman?
[00:08:56.511 --> 00:08:58.392]  ...whereby those important events of the past...
[00:08:59.051 --> 00:09:02.933]  Usually associated with someone's death or the end of some awful bloody struggle.
[00:09:02.953 --> 00:09:05.373]  A celebration for the nice holiday.
[00:09:05.393 --> 00:09:08.495]  I thought we could mark this September the 5th.
[00:09:09.075 --> 00:09:11.236]  A day that is sadly no longer remembered.
[00:09:11.716 --> 00:09:15.717]  By taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat.
[00:09:16.358 --> 00:09:19.159]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak.
[00:09:19.419 --> 00:09:19.759]  We think.
[00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:20.299]  Just let us think.
[00:09:20.319 --> 00:09:25.961]  In fact, even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns are supposed to be on their way.
[00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:27.002]  Tell Professor.
[00:09:27.142 --> 00:09:27.362]  Why?
[00:09:28.206 --> 00:09:34.272]  Because while the clansmen may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:09:34.793 --> 00:09:40.458]  Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of a truce.
[00:09:40.598 --> 00:09:44.462]  But the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with them.
[00:09:44.462 --> 00:09:45.083]  We're good to go.
[00:10:07.182 --> 00:10:09.805]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:10:09.825 --> 00:10:11.688]  They will be held accountable.
[00:10:11.708 --> 00:10:17.595]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:10:18.783 --> 00:10:20.264]  I know why you did it.
[00:10:20.764 --> 00:10:21.865]  I know you were afraid.
[00:10:21.885 --> 00:10:23.066]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:10:24.027 --> 00:10:24.087]  War?
[00:10:24.247 --> 00:10:24.787]  Terror?
[00:10:24.887 --> 00:10:25.568]  Disease?
[00:10:26.188 --> 00:10:32.032]  There were a million problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.073]  Fear got the best of you.
[00:10:34.454 --> 00:10:38.416]  And in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:10:38.997 --> 00:10:40.077]  He promised you order.
[00:10:40.117 --> 00:10:41.178]  He promised you peace.
[00:10:41.618 --> 00:10:45.221]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:46.522]  Inspector, you're almost through.
[00:10:46.642 --> 00:10:48.643]  Last night, I sought to end that silence.
[00:10:49.444 --> 00:10:56.454]  Last night, I destroyed the old Bailey to remind this country of what it has forgotten.
[00:10:56.474 --> 00:11:01.942]  More than 400 years ago, a great citizen wished to embed the 5th of November forever in our memory.
[00:11:02.546 --> 00:11:07.471]  His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are mortal words.
[00:11:08.151 --> 00:11:09.533]  They are perspectives.
[00:11:10.374 --> 00:11:19.962]  So if you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you, then I would suggest that you allow the Fifth of November to pass unmarked.
[00:11:20.703 --> 00:11:39.594]  But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a 5th of November that shall never, ever be forgotten.
[00:11:42.143 --> 00:11:43.664]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:43.704 --> 00:11:54.270]  Today is the day, grassroots movement nationwide, started by great patriots, to mark the 5th of November by donating to RonPaul2008.com.
[00:11:54.350 --> 00:12:08.258]  The attacks are intensifying on the congressmen from Texas daily, the enemies of liberty, the enemies of this republic, the people destroying our sovereignty and our currency and our military and our name worldwide.
[00:12:09.136 --> 00:12:09.836]  Never rest!
[00:12:09.936 --> 00:12:11.117]  And we cannot rest!
[00:12:11.177 --> 00:12:12.697]  And they are very upset.
[00:12:13.037 --> 00:12:14.138]  They are now fearful.
[00:12:14.538 --> 00:12:18.499]  They are now admitting Ron Paul for at least a month as a first-tier candidate.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.421]  It is now the 5th of November.
[00:12:23.881 --> 00:12:32.124]  And I want you to go link through at PrisonPlanet.com or go to RonPaul2008.com or call 1-800-RON-PAUL.
[00:12:32.944 --> 00:12:34.145]  And I want you to donate, whether it's $10,
[00:12:35.729 --> 00:12:38.851]  Or $2,300, the maximum an individual can give.
[00:12:39.231 --> 00:12:46.376]  I want you to give it because this man is a great patriot and has a flawless voting record and is an absolute godsend.
[00:12:46.836 --> 00:12:48.017]  He would have stood out in 1776 or 1789.
[00:12:48.077 --> 00:12:50.659]  He would have stood out in 1825 and he stands out today in 2007.
[00:12:59.838 --> 00:13:15.013]  And many of us privately behind the scenes challenged him and demanded and told him that he had a moral responsibility, even if he didn't think he had any chance of winning, to run for president to inject real issues into the debate, which he has already certainly done in spades.
[00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:20.878]  But more than that, that he could capture the imagination, because freedom is popular, and that he could win!
[00:13:22.089 --> 00:13:26.013]  I personally challenged him repeatedly for years.
[00:13:26.433 --> 00:13:30.537]  Thousands of you challenged him on talk radio interviews and in person.
[00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:33.159]  And now I challenge you.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.621]  He has been challenged by us.
[00:13:36.082 --> 00:13:48.713]  He took the call to be a hero for liberty, a champion for freedom, to take the field against the New World Order at great personal danger, both physical, financial, and in his name.
[00:13:50.058 --> 00:14:00.165]  And now he's done it, so he has taken our call and now we must support him 110%, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:00.685 --> 00:14:02.486]  It is our responsibility.
[00:14:02.947 --> 00:14:04.187]  We called him.
[00:14:04.207 --> 00:14:07.630]  He answered the call.
[00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.373]  He is 72 years old and doing on average 10 interviews a day.
[00:14:12.433 --> 00:14:15.335]  I've talked to his media coordinator privately.
[00:14:16.278 --> 00:14:28.342]  He is working until around midnight every evening and not shirking any of his responsibilities in Congress, as most people who run for president do shirk their responsibility.
[00:14:28.382 --> 00:14:30.823]  Even when they're running for Congress, they shirk their responsibility on voting.
[00:14:31.223 --> 00:14:32.063]  Not Ron Paul.
[00:14:32.724 --> 00:14:35.065]  And frankly, I can see the physical weight on him.
[00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:36.245]  He is probably aged.
[00:14:37.177 --> 00:14:43.501]  He looked like he was 55, 60 years old just a year ago, and he looks 72 now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:43.881 --> 00:14:55.749]  But though he is a champion athlete in his own right in the past, and a runner, swimmer, baseball, he's certainly sacrificing a lot of his very essence on the altar of liberty and freedom.
[00:14:55.789 --> 00:15:02.032]  So again, if you don't respond to the call to donate to Ron Paul, 2008.com, you are mad.
[00:15:02.052 --> 00:15:02.673]  You are insane.
[00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:12.345]  Alright, I've said it and I'm done talking about it.
[00:15:12.465 --> 00:15:16.629]  Later, when the story goes up on PrisonPlanet.com, I will discuss it.
[00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:26.277]  Coming up today, Robert Baer, one of the senior members of the Central Intelligence Agency, he's even been a CIA Section Chief, has gone public.
[00:15:26.617 --> 00:15:35.125]  He's gone public several times in the last year, but now he's been clearer than ever, saying that the evidence in 9-11 points towards an inside job.
[00:15:36.011 --> 00:15:37.012]  Very respected.
[00:15:37.032 --> 00:15:40.035]  Of course, the movie Siriana is about his real life.
[00:15:40.055 --> 00:15:42.057]  Academy Award winning film.
[00:15:43.658 --> 00:15:45.500]  And played by George Clooney.
[00:15:47.202 --> 00:15:49.964]  So, we are also working on getting him on the show.
[00:15:50.805 --> 00:15:54.128]  But he has gone publicly playing some audio of that coming up.
[00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:58.132]  Also, we're going to get into this story.
[00:15:58.212 --> 00:16:00.454]  Former NFL star, pro bowler,
[00:16:01.164 --> 00:16:03.466]  Latest to question 9-11 official story.
[00:16:03.826 --> 00:16:08.270]  I had another Pro Bowl football player contact me about a month ago, a month and a half ago.
[00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.371]  I never got back with him.
[00:16:09.391 --> 00:16:10.512]  That's how busy we are.
[00:16:10.532 --> 00:16:15.516]  But we need to dig through our email and get in contact with him.
[00:16:16.957 --> 00:16:28.147]  But former NFL star, latest to question 9-11 official story, ex-Dallas Cowboys lineman, tells Indiana newspaper of doubts
[00:16:29.978 --> 00:16:32.579]  So we'll be telling you who that is and going over a little bit later.
[00:16:32.599 --> 00:16:40.761]  And he went through the lengthy interview, breaking down Building 7 being imploded and the rest of it very eloquently.
[00:16:41.381 --> 00:16:53.384]  So this is extremely exciting because we had Martin Sheen and we had two other big actors, of course, George Carlin, the famous comedian, going public last week.
[00:16:54.376 --> 00:17:01.840]  It's just, it is an exponential landslide, and they can't blackball and demonize and destroy everyone.
[00:17:03.741 --> 00:17:08.144]  If I'm proud of anything in my life, it is that I hit the barbed wire first for 9-11 Truth.
[00:17:09.324 --> 00:17:23.332]  Before it happened, the morning it happened, I saw many other of my colleagues attack me and say I'd gone too far, and later to declare themselves the mantle of first 9-11 stalwarts, I frankly could care less.
[00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:24.957]  Who went first?
[00:17:25.678 --> 00:17:27.400]  A lot of people spoke out and exposed it.
[00:17:27.821 --> 00:17:34.069]  It's about saving lives and saving the republic, but in hindsight that is definitely a treasured jewel.
[00:17:34.989 --> 00:17:43.012]  Kind of a memento, but I treasure it because it is an example of what you can do if you take action.
[00:17:43.492 --> 00:18:02.519]  And if you don't listen to the naysayers that tell you that we can't win, or liberty can't prevail, or that freedom can't grow, that there's no point to even get up in the morning, just slovenly disconnect from reality and stumble around unhappily, unfulfilled, I am just blown away every day by how fulfilled and how rich
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:11.884]  My life is, and how honored I am to be able to associate with men and women of every race, color, and creed on this globe who love liberty.
[00:18:12.684 --> 00:18:25.730]  We don't even all agree with each other on every issue, or many issues, but we desire freedom, and we desire truth and justice, and I am just honored to be associated with all of you.
[00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.411]  And that means you, the listeners.
[00:18:29.637 --> 00:18:33.060]  I realize sometimes the amazing responsibility I have.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.123]  It hits me by the unbelievably prominent icons.
[00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:41.766]  Iconic individuals that listen to the show on a daily basis.
[00:18:41.786 --> 00:18:43.707]  The people I learn that listen to the show.
[00:18:43.727 --> 00:18:45.869]  The people that contact me but don't wish to go public.
[00:18:46.369 --> 00:18:47.510]  The people I speak with.
[00:18:47.931 --> 00:18:53.855]  But that is no different than just a school teacher or an auto mechanic who goes public and speaks out.
[00:18:53.935 --> 00:18:55.896]  You are all heroes.
[00:18:55.936 --> 00:18:57.778]  In fact, the auto mechanic who speaks out is
[00:18:58.766 --> 00:19:03.950]  Much greater person than some prominent individual that knows the truth but doesn't speak out through fear.
[00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:10.535]  But it's becoming more and more acceptable to get past the fear factor and to speak out.
[00:19:10.555 --> 00:19:13.437]  And that's why I admire Charlie Sheen so much.
[00:19:13.457 --> 00:19:14.838]  You can attack him.
[00:19:15.038 --> 00:19:16.179]  All of us have skeletons.
[00:19:16.299 --> 00:19:18.141]  All of us have done things we shouldn't have.
[00:19:18.401 --> 00:19:19.262]  None of us are perfect.
[00:19:19.502 --> 00:19:20.262]  We've all sinned.
[00:19:20.322 --> 00:19:20.823]  We know that.
[00:19:21.503 --> 00:19:26.407]  And come short of the glory of God, our best works are as if dirty rags.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:37.729]  But the point is, is Charlie was the first super-prominent person to go public and in a big way, and he started, I can chart, the cascade of events that led us to where we are today.
[00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:54.422]  Alright, there's so much news, financial that's absolutely horrifying, some positive news, war news, the good, the bad, and the ugly, it's all coming up in the next two hours and forty minutes, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:01.287 --> 00:20:05.131]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:20:05.151 --> 00:20:06.412]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:10.156]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:20:10.436 --> 00:20:12.959]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:20:13.359 --> 00:20:15.121]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:20:15.441 --> 00:20:17.743]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:29.231]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:20:29.511 --> 00:20:33.494]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:20:34.475 --> 00:20:36.356]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:20:36.556 --> 00:20:39.018]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.

[00:20:42.101 --> 00:20:42.781]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:20:42.821 --> 00:20:45.523]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[00:20:45.543 --> 00:20:46.184]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:21:00.763 --> 00:21:03.244]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:03.784 --> 00:21:10.906]  Did you know that Bible prophecy talks about the United States, British Commonwealth, Russia, China, and the Communist world in the last days?
[00:21:11.726 --> 00:21:17.368]  Did you know that it predicts a confrontation between atheistic communism and the Western world of Christianity?
[00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:21.509]  The plans have already been laid and they conform to Bible prophecy.
[00:21:22.209 --> 00:21:31.855]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:00.966 --> 00:22:02.026]  The Digestive Tract.
[00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:05.347]  A natural waste factory built within all of our bodies.
[00:22:05.727 --> 00:22:10.708]  Roughly 25 feet of tunnels designed to absorb nutrition and then dispel the waste.
[00:22:11.128 --> 00:22:13.008]  But what happens when the waste gets clogged up?
[00:22:13.752 --> 00:22:20.757]  More than 4 million Americans have frequent constipation, accounting for 2.5 million physician visits a year.
[00:22:21.217 --> 00:22:26.181]  Now there's AlloCleanse, an all-natural formula based on herbs and safe enzymes.
[00:22:26.481 --> 00:22:31.865]  AlloCleanse gently sweeps the entire digestive tract and supports comfortable, regular bathroom habits.
[00:22:32.025 --> 00:22:34.387]  You'll feel lighter, and you'll feel clean inside.
[00:22:34.487 --> 00:22:38.330]  And when you remove the waste buildup with AlloCleanse, you'll have more energy.
[00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:39.991]  Energy to use on other things.
[00:22:40.572 --> 00:22:42.234]  Besides worrying about constipation.
[00:22:42.714 --> 00:22:47.558]  For a risk-free trial of Allocleanse, call 1-800-890-3525.

[00:22:53.663 --> 00:22:53.943]  That's 1-800-890-3525.
[00:23:00.798 --> 00:23:01.959]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:23:01.979 --> 00:23:04.360]  I'm the nuclear medical report here on Genesis.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.481]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:08.201]  is a real thing.
[00:23:08.281 --> 00:23:15.184]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:23:15.284 --> 00:23:20.546]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:23:20.746 --> 00:23:21.487]  We're good to go!
[00:23:47.566 --> 00:23:50.888]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:23:50.908 --> 00:23:51.489]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[00:23:51.569 --> 00:23:53.870]  The most powerful natural anti-microbial available.
[00:24:25.154 --> 00:24:28.275]  This world is ruled by violence.
[00:24:28.515 --> 00:24:32.656]  You better get that through your head.
[00:25:04.202 --> 00:25:12.345]  From Broadway to the Milky Way.
[00:25:12.385 --> 00:25:16.767]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:18.628 --> 00:25:23.750]  A man's gonna do what he has to do.
[00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:24.190]  That's right.
[00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:28.452]  The New World Order's been coming down on us forever, poisoning our food, our water, our vaccines.
[00:25:29.233 --> 00:25:33.958]  Setting up debtor systems to implode our economy for controlled consolidation and global government.
[00:25:34.598 --> 00:25:36.901]  And a man's going to do what a man's got to do.
[00:25:36.941 --> 00:25:43.387]  We're just fighting back against you murdering criminals and letting everybody know who you are and you're going to lose.
[00:25:44.308 --> 00:25:49.133]  Because the secret to this world is when people finally stand up and get angry and take action.
[00:25:51.335 --> 00:25:53.517]  The evil is going to implode and is going to fall.
[00:25:54.776 --> 00:25:57.537]  All right, I'm looking at the Mukasey situation first.
[00:25:57.557 --> 00:26:04.978]  You've got this operative, this corrupt individual, this individual who was involved in all sorts of scandals.
[00:26:06.458 --> 00:26:08.938]  When the federal marshals hate somebody, you know you've got a problem.
[00:26:10.719 --> 00:26:16.480]  And covering up who really bombed the World Trade Center in 93, even though the New York Times admitted the Feds cooked the bomb, framed the drivers.
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.380]  Involved in fake kangaroo court stuff after 9-11.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.361]  He's a real monster.
[00:26:21.921 --> 00:26:23.441]  Teams up nicely with Chertoff.
[00:26:24.275 --> 00:26:30.939]  By the way, I didn't used to believe when I heard like six, seven years ago when Chertoff was just the deputy of Ashcroft that his name meant the devil.
[00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:40.024]  So I actually looked it up in two online, a few months ago, two online Russian dictionaries and Chertoff really means son of the devil.
[00:26:41.925 --> 00:26:44.306]  I mean, that's like a horrible name in Russian.
[00:26:44.366 --> 00:26:45.787]  No one would have that last name.
[00:26:46.868 --> 00:26:48.849]  Why did his family take the name Chertoff?
[00:26:48.949 --> 00:26:50.970]  It's just, it's so possessive.
[00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:52.551]  You couldn't make this stuff up.
[00:26:53.303 --> 00:26:55.465]  You couldn't make it up!
[00:26:57.126 --> 00:27:04.211]  You couldn't make up that Marcus Wolf, the former head of the SCSI, was hired by this government four years ago to shut up things, and now they've done it.
[00:27:04.251 --> 00:27:05.853]  I mean, it's just, you can't make it up!
[00:27:07.314 --> 00:27:15.560]  Mukasey, there's this national debate over whether waterboarding, and they keep showing on TV, putting a rag in somebody's mouth, clamping their nose shut, and pouring water down their throat.
[00:27:16.281 --> 00:27:18.222]  That's what you do in the field, okay?
[00:27:18.422 --> 00:27:20.464]  Real waterboarding, it's a board for a reason.
[00:27:20.724 --> 00:27:22.005]  They slide the board up,
[00:27:22.828 --> 00:27:27.810]  And they slide your head into a pool of water, a bucket, a bathtub, or a big container.
[00:27:29.091 --> 00:27:30.932]  And you start grounding them.
[00:27:31.592 --> 00:27:33.753]  Now, it's one of the most brutal forms of torture.
[00:27:33.773 --> 00:27:37.455]  People routinely die while under it.
[00:27:38.896 --> 00:27:44.118]  And now, that's what the White House men will say, killing people isn't torture.
[00:27:44.718 --> 00:27:46.259]  And they talk to us like we're little kids.
[00:27:46.319 --> 00:27:50.521]  But I guess with a country where the average American can't find their state on a map or the U.S.
[00:27:50.581 --> 00:27:51.942]  on a map, I mean, I guess it works.
[00:27:53.124 --> 00:27:59.828]  But, uh, by the way, the police have been doing this for a long time in the state and federal prisons, and thousands of cases of it that are known.
[00:27:59.848 --> 00:28:01.910]  And it's routine to torture people.
[00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:06.212]  Another way to waterboard is put a bag over their head and start asphyxiating people.
[00:28:07.313 --> 00:28:09.734]  It's hardcore torture, thousands of years old.
[00:28:10.375 --> 00:28:12.496]  And to have debates now about whether it's torture.
[00:28:12.536 --> 00:28:18.100]  Here is Giuliani on Bloomberg, and they're actually having a debate, like, is it torture?
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:18.520]  Here we go.
[00:28:21.036 --> 00:28:23.336]  Let me try a couple of national security questions.
[00:28:23.396 --> 00:28:29.398]  Waterboarder, you've noted that Congress has not outlawed it, and that you say it's not necessarily torture, it depends on the circumstances.
[00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:35.739]  John McCain says you are wrong, and he says you haven't served in the military and have no experience in the conduct of warfare.
[00:28:36.019 --> 00:28:38.299]  Do you know more about torture than John McCain?
[00:28:38.319 --> 00:28:43.280]  I can't say that I do, but I do know a lot about intensive questioning, intensive questioning techniques.
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.300]  After all, I've had a different experience than John.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.161]  John has never run a city, never run a state,
[00:28:49.608 --> 00:28:50.369]  Never run a government.
[00:28:51.249 --> 00:28:57.013]  He's never been responsible as a mayor for the safety and security of millions of people.
[00:28:57.514 --> 00:28:59.895]  And he's never run a law enforcement agency, which I've done.
[00:29:00.376 --> 00:29:02.297]  Now, intensive questioning works.
[00:29:02.817 --> 00:29:09.582]  If I didn't use intensive questioning, there'd be a lot of mafia guys running around New York right now, and crime would be a lot higher in New York than it is.
[00:29:10.383 --> 00:29:12.124]  Intensive questioning... Stop it right there!
[00:29:12.324 --> 00:29:17.448]  We'll come back and play the rest, but... We are to be told, we are to believe,
[00:29:18.493 --> 00:29:21.054]  He's implying that he tortured people in New York.
[00:29:21.175 --> 00:29:25.237]  Intensive interrogation techniques and waterboarding isn't torture.
[00:29:26.978 --> 00:29:28.378]  Waterboarding isn't torture.
[00:29:28.538 --> 00:29:30.960]  Grounding someone repeatedly over and over again for hours.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.361]  Boy, they'll tell you whatever you want to hear.
[00:29:33.581 --> 00:29:37.603]  It's only good if you want fake intelligence and false confessions.
[00:29:38.464 --> 00:29:47.829]  And yeah, if you want to get Michaui, who they admit they tortured for years, up there to say he's guilty, yeah, it works for fake confessions for chicken-neck people to watch on television.
[00:29:50.774 --> 00:29:53.780]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.702 --> 00:29:57.407]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.729 --> 00:30:01.370]  It's a fact.
[00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:09.076]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:30:09.196 --> 00:30:18.064]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:30:18.344 --> 00:30:28.873]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:30:29.133 --> 00:30:35.196]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:40.439]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:30:40.619 --> 00:30:45.102]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:30:45.262 --> 00:30:47.063]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:30:47.123 --> 00:30:47.303]  That's 877-943-8600.

[00:32:00.598 --> 00:32:02.939]  America is the fattest nation on the planet.
[00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:09.543]  The obesity epidemic kills over 300,000 Americans each and every year, and this number continues to rise at an alarming rate.
[00:32:09.703 --> 00:32:12.805]  With fast food chains everywhere, eating right is not an easy task.
[00:32:13.025 --> 00:32:16.167]  It's time to stop eating those unhealthy meals and fattening snacks.
[00:32:16.427 --> 00:32:19.088]  Assured that you and your family do not become a statistic.
[00:32:19.328 --> 00:32:21.550]  Introducing the Excalibur Dehydrator.
[00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.591]  The Excalibur Dehydrator brings healthy eating to a whole new level.
[00:32:24.671 --> 00:32:29.474]  The Excalibur Dehydrator preserves fruits, vegetables, fish, and beef quickly and easily.
[00:32:29.654 --> 00:32:38.281]  The Excalibur Dehydrator is perfect for vegetarians, vegans, and those who want to cut out the unnecessary salt, fat, and preservatives in most foods found at the grocery store.

[00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:51.411]  That's Drawings123.com.
[00:32:59.557 --> 00:33:00.918]  I think so.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:28.804]  I'm a man of constant sorrow.
[00:33:29.024 --> 00:33:32.787]  I've seen trouble all my days.
[00:33:32.827 --> 00:33:34.148]  I'm a bit bare-witted.
[00:33:39.491 --> 00:33:40.132]  Welcome back!
[00:33:40.172 --> 00:33:48.196]  Thank you so much for joining us on this 5th of November edition
[00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:21.972]  Dr. Boyd E. Graves is going to be joining us.
[00:34:21.992 --> 00:34:29.077]  He's done a lot to document the actual biological weapons documents to develop the AIDS virus in the 1970s.
[00:34:29.438 --> 00:34:33.000]  This fits into a continual series I'm going to be doing in the next few weeks every other day.
[00:34:33.741 --> 00:34:36.203]  We've got Dr. Stan Monteith coming on later in the week.
[00:34:37.111 --> 00:34:42.892]  To talk about the history of biological and chemical and radiological testing on the American people.
[00:34:42.912 --> 00:34:46.673]  The official plans to exterminate 80% of the world's population.
[00:34:46.733 --> 00:34:48.794]  Medical doctors have been exposing this for more than 20 years.
[00:34:49.414 --> 00:34:50.254]  Dr. Stan Monteith.
[00:34:50.794 --> 00:34:56.956]  We've got Dr. Michael Kaufman lined up to talk about the whole environmental angle and the global taxation system and their own documents and statements.
[00:34:57.236 --> 00:35:00.617]  There's so many thousands of documents and statements we have multiple guests on just to cover it all.
[00:35:01.477 --> 00:35:04.518]  And many other guests coming up in the next few weeks along those lines.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:19.024]  I'm also working on getting some of the people writing books and putting out policy papers and government individuals who said this is all good and who openly are pushing it, but they normally find out who we are and refuse to come on, but we're working on that as well.
[00:35:19.064 --> 00:35:35.289]  Speaking of endgame, blueprints for global enslavement that you can watch in super high quality right now at PrisonPlanet.tv and that we encourage you to burn to disk in high quality from that super high quality download at PrisonPlanet.tv to give to others, your friends and family and neighbors.
[00:35:36.209 --> 00:35:38.391]  Only 15 cents a day at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:38.411 --> 00:35:39.472]  That just pays for the bandwidth.
[00:35:40.533 --> 00:35:41.914]  And again, it's almost DVD quality.
[00:35:41.934 --> 00:35:42.615]  It's so amazing.
[00:35:43.636 --> 00:35:45.858]  Just go check out the trailers on the website.
[00:35:45.878 --> 00:35:47.259]  Not the trailers on YouTube or Google.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:54.546]  The trailers on WhatIsTheEndGame.com or PrisonPlanet.tv to see the type of quality you're going to be watching this in.
[00:35:55.347 --> 00:36:01.212]  Tonight, it's getting close to being sold out, but they keep about 20-30 tickets.
[00:36:02.771 --> 00:36:07.752]  Until the hour before and they can put out some folding chairs for those that are stragglers.
[00:36:07.812 --> 00:36:09.153]  But I want to see you there tonight.
[00:36:09.173 --> 00:36:14.214]  I'll be giving a speech at the beginning and a question and answer at the end at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:36:14.274 --> 00:36:15.594]  And then no showing tomorrow night.
[00:36:15.614 --> 00:36:18.615]  And then we have showings on Wednesday and Thursday.
[00:36:18.655 --> 00:36:20.176]  I'll be at both of those too.
[00:36:20.236 --> 00:36:22.836]  This is your chance on the big screen to see Endgame.
[00:36:22.856 --> 00:36:24.957]  I'm not going to show it anymore on the big screen here in Austin.
[00:36:25.697 --> 00:36:26.157]  This is it.
[00:36:26.277 --> 00:36:26.797]  I promise.
[00:36:26.837 --> 00:36:28.818]  If people ask for these extra showings, this is it.
[00:36:29.798 --> 00:36:32.399]  So bring your friends, bring your neighbors, bring the skeptics.
[00:36:33.431 --> 00:36:35.072]  Bring them to see it on the big screen.
[00:36:35.132 --> 00:36:38.614]  It's particularly powerful on the big screen.
[00:36:39.935 --> 00:36:41.036]  So I hope to see you there tonight.
[00:36:41.416 --> 00:36:42.437]  Oh, and by the way, I keep forgetting.
[00:36:42.477 --> 00:36:43.217]  I mentioned this Friday.
[00:36:43.577 --> 00:36:44.918]  Anybody who has a ticket stub.
[00:36:47.159 --> 00:36:49.681]  And that means if you can find your ticket stub from an earlier showing.
[00:36:50.919 --> 00:36:57.741]  Anybody who has a ticket stub to this showing, the next showing, or the showing after that, in person, at the Alamo Draft House, you get in game for $10.
[00:36:57.781 --> 00:37:03.583]  That's half off, so basically, your $8 movie ticket and plus $2 is free.
[00:37:04.503 --> 00:37:19.948]  So, you get to get the film, half price, with your ticket stub, and I'm doing that for tonight's showing, and the next two, and yes, if you went to one of the other showings, and it's not fair, if you just show up tonight, it'll be $10.
[00:37:21.124 --> 00:37:25.468]  But I would ask you to come see the film if you haven't.
[00:37:26.068 --> 00:37:28.610]  But I'll be there tonight, Wednesday night, and Thursday night.
[00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:29.010]  Okay.
[00:37:32.193 --> 00:37:34.455]  What do I have here in front of me?
[00:37:35.055 --> 00:37:35.596]  What's coming up?
[00:37:35.636 --> 00:37:36.616]  More on Giuliani.
[00:37:36.757 --> 00:37:38.978]  I use very aggressive, intensive interrogation techniques.
[00:37:38.998 --> 00:37:39.739]  He says he's done it.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.141]  And I guess it's true.
[00:37:42.201 --> 00:37:48.546]  I mean, in New York, they'll rape somebody, I don't want to get into it, but for two hours with a broken off broom handle.
[00:37:50.911 --> 00:37:51.952]  Remember that famous case?
[00:37:51.992 --> 00:37:57.356]  I mean, this is just... I have the New York police in New York preparing to frame me.
[00:37:57.956 --> 00:38:00.778]  When they arrested me, they were saying, oh yeah, he hit a cop.
[00:38:00.798 --> 00:38:02.039]  And they were getting ready to book me in for that.
[00:38:02.059 --> 00:38:04.261]  And I said, listen, I'm a public figure.
[00:38:04.421 --> 00:38:05.602]  Please don't make me sue you.
[00:38:06.683 --> 00:38:07.964]  I said, please don't frame me.
[00:38:07.984 --> 00:38:08.985]  You know I didn't touch anybody.
[00:38:09.025 --> 00:38:09.985]  It's all on camera.
[00:38:10.265 --> 00:38:15.129]  They had a little discussion and said, okay, well, we're just gonna say you didn't turn the bullhorn off when we told you.
[00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:19.993]  I mean, you should see cops there about to frame me.
[00:38:20.803 --> 00:38:24.325]  I know a lot of police forces aren't like this, and I don't know why I'm getting off into that.
[00:38:24.345 --> 00:38:26.427]  The point is, is that it's scary.
[00:38:26.547 --> 00:38:32.811]  It lets you know just how far this country's fallen, because it's on literally 15, 20, 30 cameras.
[00:38:33.311 --> 00:38:35.952]  There were 300 people, and I'd say every two or three people had a camera.
[00:38:35.973 --> 00:38:37.493]  So I don't know, maybe 100 cameras?
[00:38:37.553 --> 00:38:37.954]  I don't know.
[00:38:38.254 --> 00:38:39.495]  Just cameras everywhere.
[00:38:40.355 --> 00:38:44.498]  In New York, we both warned Geraldo when he was live on television outside
[00:38:45.354 --> 00:38:47.156]  And, uh, you can see video of the arrest.
[00:38:47.176 --> 00:38:47.957]  It's all over YouTube.
[00:38:47.977 --> 00:38:50.220]  It's type Alex Jones arrested in New York and you can see it.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.501]  And they walked over.
[00:38:51.982 --> 00:38:53.063]  I'd already put down the bullhorn.
[00:38:53.083 --> 00:38:54.384]  Didn't even have it in my hand.
[00:38:54.444 --> 00:38:55.606]  They said, come over and talk to us.
[00:38:55.966 --> 00:38:57.087]  I had my hands at my side.
[00:38:57.468 --> 00:38:58.829]  And they said, put your hands behind your back.
[00:38:58.869 --> 00:39:02.914]  And I put my hands behind my back and didn't resist them in any way.
[00:39:04.125 --> 00:39:05.827]  And frankly, there wouldn't have been cameras there.
[00:39:05.927 --> 00:39:08.489]  I would be charged right now with assaulting New York police.
[00:39:09.129 --> 00:39:13.733]  By the way, they attacked Discovery Channel cameraman, knocked him on the ground, attacked my cameraman, broke one of our cameras.
[00:39:14.113 --> 00:39:15.854]  They had a police riot in New York.
[00:39:18.156 --> 00:39:20.058]  And then we're gonna charge me with assault.
[00:39:20.778 --> 00:39:21.299]  An officer.
[00:39:21.479 --> 00:39:22.920]  And that's not right!
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.081]  I'm a human being!
[00:39:24.741 --> 00:39:26.243]  It's not right to ruin my life.
[00:39:26.303 --> 00:39:27.624]  It's not right to frame me.
[00:39:28.304 --> 00:39:29.645]  It's not right to laugh about it.
[00:39:29.685 --> 00:39:30.526]  Maybe they were joking.
[00:39:31.388 --> 00:39:33.109]  You know, laughing about, oh, he hit a cop.
[00:39:33.129 --> 00:39:34.209]  You know, what are you in here for?
[00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:39.472]  Right before they put me into the cell, you know, taking the cuffs off with the jailer, the head jailer standing over me with two cops behind me.
[00:39:39.932 --> 00:39:42.353]  You're not going to hit us, are you, like you did out there?
[00:39:43.854 --> 00:39:44.735]  He's a big guy.
[00:39:44.775 --> 00:39:45.875]  Maybe he's going to take a swing.
[00:39:46.295 --> 00:39:47.076]  What's he in here for?
[00:39:47.756 --> 00:39:48.717]  Oh, he hit an officer.
[00:39:49.757 --> 00:39:50.698]  Oh, you hit an officer.
[00:39:51.578 --> 00:39:54.299]  And I just said, listen, guys, there's cameras.
[00:39:54.499 --> 00:39:55.460]  It was all taped.
[00:39:57.313 --> 00:40:00.496]  The point is, even if it was a joke, you don't joke around.
[00:40:00.596 --> 00:40:01.377]  I've already digressed.
[00:40:02.798 --> 00:40:04.219]  Ron Paul's meteoric rise.
[00:40:04.259 --> 00:40:05.941]  I have his web statistic numbers here.
[00:40:05.961 --> 00:40:07.522]  I want to go over them.
[00:40:08.343 --> 00:40:09.644]  But here's the really serious news.
[00:40:09.684 --> 00:40:11.406]  Here's some positive news on the Ron Paul front.
[00:40:11.806 --> 00:40:15.669]  Reuters, Citigroup may face $11 billion write-off.
[00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:18.512]  Citigroup, the largest bank in the world.
[00:40:20.129 --> 00:40:20.709]  They say that.
[00:40:20.749 --> 00:40:21.310]  It's not really.
[00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:26.792]  It's the largest public bank that you can buy stock in that does business with the public.
[00:40:26.812 --> 00:40:28.733]  The big central banks issue the money, own the gold.
[00:40:28.773 --> 00:40:29.554]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:40:30.254 --> 00:40:30.854]  But they own it.
[00:40:31.955 --> 00:40:35.036]  Former NFL star, latest to question 9-11 official story.
[00:40:35.056 --> 00:40:37.298]  Ex-Dallas Cowboy.
[00:40:40.179 --> 00:40:42.800]  Stepnowski tells Indiana newspaper of doubts.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.621]  Very powerful.
[00:40:44.221 --> 00:40:47.883]  CNN price of war ten times pre-war predictions.
[00:40:48.952 --> 00:40:53.854]  O'Reilly's real target is the 9-11 Truth Movement, not the foundation-funded Loon Left.
[00:40:56.095 --> 00:40:59.496]  So that is some of what is coming up as well today.
[00:41:03.698 --> 00:41:04.638]  There is just so much here.
[00:41:04.658 --> 00:41:12.181]  I want to get into Perez Musharraf and martial law, of course, in Pakistan right now, and what martial law is and what it looks like.
[00:41:12.261 --> 00:41:16.683]  So that is all coming up in just the next few minutes.
[00:41:20.038 --> 00:41:36.981]  Before I do that, I want to tell you about a wonderful event that's coming up that I wish I could attend, but I've just got too much going on in the next two weeks, but I certainly wish I could attend it up in Dallas, because I've talked to folks that have been to these, and they say they're so well done and so informative, and they're diverse.
[00:41:37.001 --> 00:41:39.001]  There's so many different topics that are covered.
[00:41:39.321 --> 00:41:49.143]  That's the Freedom Law School 2007 Texas Justice, Peace, and Freedom Conference, and they're going to have William Rodriguez there, Tommy Cryer, constitutional attorney,
[00:41:50.559 --> 00:42:05.305]  David versus Goliath, victory over the IRS, Larry Becraft, April Gallup, Davon Kleist, Dylan Avery, Jason Bermans, Ted Gunderson, Mark Anderson, Gilbert Griffin, Sherry Jackson, we're not sure if she'll be there now, Robert Lawrence, Joe Bannister.
[00:42:06.846 --> 00:42:08.166]  The list goes on and on and on.
[00:42:08.186 --> 00:42:11.448]  We're talking about 9-11, the income tax, the New World Order.
[00:42:11.528 --> 00:42:14.009]  It's going to be an amazing event, no doubt.
[00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:17.673]  This is even bigger than the one they had in San Diego that was Overflow Crowd.
[00:42:18.253 --> 00:42:22.417]  So get your tickets, folks, at LiveFreeNow.org.
[00:42:22.817 --> 00:42:26.981]  LiveFreeNow.org, a big banner on the right-hand side of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:42:27.282 --> 00:42:29.083]  Or give them a call and get your tickets now.
[00:42:29.243 --> 00:42:31.285]  Last one they had sold out in San Diego.
[00:42:31.305 --> 00:42:31.345]  760-868-4271.
[00:42:31.365 --> 00:42:31.405]  760-868-4271.
[00:42:40.752 --> 00:42:40.872]  One.
[00:42:41.213 --> 00:42:44.696]  Again, that's 760-868-4271.
[00:42:45.297 --> 00:42:56.187]  Freedom Law School's 2007 Texas Justice, Peace and Freedom Conference at the Crown Plaza, North Dallas Hotel, 14315 Midway Road, Addison, Texas, 75001.
[00:42:57.368 --> 00:42:59.691]  But that's just Dallas, but there's all these towns around Dallas.
[00:43:00.131 --> 00:43:02.673]  Really nice area and I hope you check that out.
[00:43:05.532 --> 00:43:08.974]  We're going to go ahead and get into all of this news.
[00:43:09.294 --> 00:43:19.939]  Let me just go ahead and cover what's happening with 9-11 Truth.
[00:43:19.959 --> 00:43:31.524]  This is a compilation that's up on PrisonPilot.com and WeAreChangeLA.org of Bill March saying we're all crazy and then it cuts to Robert Baer who's gone public
[00:43:32.179 --> 00:43:34.641]  Repeatedly now, and really it hasn't ever gotten any media attention.
[00:43:34.661 --> 00:43:42.926]  It's kind of like Martin Sheen's so prominent in so many Academy Award winning films and top television programs that they don't want to attack him now.
[00:43:43.006 --> 00:43:46.688]  Believe me, the neocons know that last Monday it was broken here.
[00:43:47.769 --> 00:43:53.272]  And millions of people read online that Martin Sheen went public for 9-11 Truth and questioned the official fable.
[00:43:54.473 --> 00:43:55.154]  They ignored that.
[00:43:55.814 --> 00:43:58.976]  Will they ignore a big Dallas Cowboy five-time pro bowler?
[00:43:59.702 --> 00:44:02.003]  Will they ignore George Carlin?
[00:44:02.083 --> 00:44:03.444]  Will they ignore other big actors?
[00:44:03.504 --> 00:44:05.885]  Will they ignore Robert Baer?
[00:44:05.925 --> 00:44:10.568]  You can say, oh, Hollywood people, oh, top comedians, oh, Dallas Cowboys, who cares?
[00:44:12.188 --> 00:44:28.457]  But can they ignore Robert Baer, one of the most respected by his colleagues, one of the most successful clandestine actual James Bond field operatives, as high level as it gets in field operatives.
[00:44:29.446 --> 00:44:30.747]  Tortured the whole nine yards.
[00:44:31.287 --> 00:44:32.367]  Had his fingernails ripped out.
[00:44:32.387 --> 00:44:32.808]  You name it.
[00:44:36.669 --> 00:44:37.270]  Robert Bear.
[00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:44.813]  And so the first person you hear is Robert Bear being interviewed after sniveling comments by Bill Maher.
[00:44:44.853 --> 00:44:46.034]  And then it cuts into Martin Sheen.
[00:44:46.074 --> 00:44:46.414]  Here it is.
[00:44:47.254 --> 00:44:57.059]  Crazy people who still think the government brought down the Twin Towers in a controlled explosion have to stop pretending that I'm the one who's being naive.
[00:44:58.121 --> 00:45:01.883]  So, are you just, you know, personally of the opinion?
[00:45:01.923 --> 00:45:11.948]  I mean, obviously you can't speak for the CIA or your previous activities with the agency, but are you of the opinion that there was an aspect of inside jobs in 9-11 within the U.S.
[00:45:11.968 --> 00:45:12.288]  government?
[00:45:13.328 --> 00:45:14.489]  There's that possibility.
[00:45:14.529 --> 00:45:15.749]  The evidence points at it.
[00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:18.431]  And why is it not being investigated?
[00:45:20.272 --> 00:45:23.093]  Why isn't the WMD story being investigated?
[00:45:23.293 --> 00:45:26.555]  Why hasn't anybody been held accountable for 9-11?
[00:45:28.183 --> 00:45:30.924]  Um, and you know, we held people accountable after Pearl Harbor.
[00:45:30.944 --> 00:45:34.765]  I mean, you know, why has there been no change of command?
[00:45:34.845 --> 00:45:37.006]  Why has there been no political repercussions?
[00:45:37.627 --> 00:45:43.749]  Why has there been no, um, any sort of exposure on this?
[00:45:44.209 --> 00:45:45.349]  It really makes you wonder.
[00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:54.753]  Stop asking me to raise this ridiculous topic on the show and start asking your doctor if Paxil is right for you.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:00.924]  I did not want to believe that my government could possibly be involved in such a thing.
[00:46:01.004 --> 00:46:03.626]  Absolutely, I don't think any of us want to believe that.
[00:46:03.706 --> 00:46:05.987]  I certainly live in a country that I thought could do that.
[00:46:06.047 --> 00:46:06.448]  Exactly.
[00:46:06.508 --> 00:46:09.310]  That would be an ultimate betrayal.
[00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:09.930]  Sure.
[00:46:10.291 --> 00:46:14.354]  Then, however, there's been so many revelations that now I have my doubts.
[00:46:17.696 --> 00:46:20.499]  And chief among them is the Building 7.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:28.385]  How did they rig that building so that it came down in the evening of the day?
[00:46:29.206 --> 00:46:33.250]  The Larry Silverstein statement, the pulling, and the way that it all came down.
[00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:34.090]  Absolutely.
[00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.931]  How convenient.
[00:46:34.971 --> 00:46:35.191]  Yes.
[00:46:35.391 --> 00:46:37.173]  When did they rig that building?
[00:46:37.233 --> 00:46:42.958]  That's the most interesting question and I have not received a satisfactory answer.
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:46.841]  And you are a nutcase, building 7.
[00:47:03.188 --> 00:47:06.269]  You don't think Bin Laden knocked down the World Trade Center?
[00:47:06.289 --> 00:47:06.989]  Absolutely not!
[00:47:07.009 --> 00:47:07.730]  Come on!
[00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:08.090]  I don't!
[00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:08.990]  I don't!
[00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:10.110]  And I'm so on your side!
[00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.830]  I am so not along!
[00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:11.730]  That doesn't mean you're right!
[00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:14.531]  At the World Trade Center, three buildings came down like demolition.
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:32.423]  Two of them were hit by a plane, but the third one, they said, do you want us to pull it?
[00:47:32.923 --> 00:47:35.024]  And they pulled it, and it looked just like the other two.
[00:47:36.144 --> 00:47:37.285]  Those things bother me.
[00:47:38.466 --> 00:47:45.549]  But, I mean, a controlled demolition, wouldn't they have had to have planned a lot of demolitions in the building?
[00:47:45.569 --> 00:47:47.330]  Wouldn't have someone seen that?
[00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:49.931]  Listen, the fact that
[00:47:51.224 --> 00:48:04.114]  The fact that the 9-11 investigation went from the moment the planes hit to the moment that the buildings fell and nothing before and nothing after, I think makes that investigation completely illegitimate.
[00:48:04.935 --> 00:48:09.779]  You know, if you're going to do a crime investigation, you have to find motive, you have to find... Right.
[00:48:09.799 --> 00:48:12.261]  You know, there has to be a... We didn't follow that.
[00:48:12.381 --> 00:48:13.221]  Yes, exactly.
[00:48:13.321 --> 00:48:16.044]  It was quickly pushed away, obviously.
[00:48:16.264 --> 00:48:18.245]  The evidence was removed from the crime scene.
[00:48:18.285 --> 00:48:19.126]  There was no evidence.
[00:48:19.166 --> 00:48:20.147]  The biggest crime scene.
[00:48:20.587 --> 00:48:21.848]  Listen to this.
[00:48:22.348 --> 00:48:29.491]  36% of the American people think it is very likely or somewhat likely that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:48:29.911 --> 00:48:37.274]  They're conspiracy theorists who think that the towers may have been brought down by a controlled demolition.
[00:48:37.294 --> 00:48:48.078]  And isn't that strange that no one has seen the planes go into the Twin Towers in New York a thousand times over?
[00:48:48.118 --> 00:48:50.159]  We've never seen the plane hit the Pentagon.
[00:48:50.794 --> 00:49:08.766]  And what I said was, having filmed before at the Pentagon and noticing how the roof of the Pentagon and the parking lot and the grounds of the Pentagon, there must be a hundred video cameras surrounding the Pentagon.
[00:49:09.086 --> 00:49:16.891]  Again, the first clip you heard was Robert Baer, as high level CIA as it gets, actually running field operations for decades.
[00:49:16.971 --> 00:49:19.553]  I mean, super highly decorated, one of the most highly decorated living.
[00:49:20.308 --> 00:49:24.310]  Incredibly respected by the entire intelligence community worldwide.
[00:49:25.791 --> 00:49:27.752]  Just a very daring, very brave person.
[00:49:28.493 --> 00:49:31.334]  And here he is saying, well, the evidence points at it being an inside job.
[00:49:31.374 --> 00:49:31.594]  Yeah.
[00:49:32.995 --> 00:49:37.658]  We have government documents saying they wanted to carry out the exact type of attacks?
[00:49:38.238 --> 00:49:44.942]  The government was running the exact drills at the exact same time with the exact same targets?
[00:49:47.381 --> 00:50:00.607]  The hijackers were trained at every spy base you can imagine, and the embassies were ordered to let him back in, Mohammed Adda and others, and were told, don't worry about the terror database saying they're terrorists, that's their CIA cover!
[00:50:02.208 --> 00:50:02.848]  Cover!
[00:50:02.928 --> 00:50:04.289]  There are men!
[00:50:05.209 --> 00:50:05.689]  Done!
[00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:06.450]  Done!
[00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:07.210]  Convicted!
[00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.970]  Over!
[00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:13.193]  And there's thousands of other points, and they cannot debunk them with popular mechanics.
[00:50:13.889 --> 00:50:14.629]  Or History Channel.
[00:50:14.669 --> 00:50:16.550]  All they do is create straw men.
[00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:18.251]  They don't actually attack what we say.
[00:50:18.731 --> 00:50:21.932]  They make things up we never said, and then try to debunk them.
[00:50:23.493 --> 00:50:25.013]  And it isn't working anymore, folks.
[00:50:25.113 --> 00:50:29.855]  People are looking at the evidence, and they're finding out the truth.
[00:50:31.976 --> 00:50:33.436]  You think I'm happy about this?
[00:50:34.117 --> 00:50:38.558]  You think it's fun to go on air and say our government's completely criminal and murderous?
[00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:42.920]  You think it's fun to know I live in a country like this, in a world like this?
[00:50:43.974 --> 00:50:46.095]  I wish it was all mom and apple pie and everything was fine.
[00:50:46.115 --> 00:50:48.177]  I'd be at ball games three days a week.
[00:50:48.897 --> 00:50:51.458]  I'd be fishing for bass, probably right now.
[00:50:52.599 --> 00:50:53.740]  But I have to get up here.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.720]  I have to do it.
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.101]  These are murderers.
[00:50:56.341 --> 00:50:57.682]  They've got to be brought to justice.
[00:50:58.002 --> 00:50:59.243]  We'll be right back with more news.
[00:51:01.224 --> 00:51:02.645]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.705 --> 00:51:04.746]  A new world order.
[00:51:05.466 --> 00:51:09.849]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by the power of the dark.
[00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:12.072]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[00:51:13.174 --> 00:51:15.416]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:15.957 --> 00:51:18.400]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:19.141 --> 00:51:26.490]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:29.477 --> 00:51:34.461]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:34.942 --> 00:51:38.425]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:38.805 --> 00:51:41.327]  Bill of Rarities makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:41.387 --> 00:51:42.528]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:42.548 --> 00:51:43.309]  They're not after money.
[00:51:43.329 --> 00:51:44.410]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:45.350]  They're after power.
[00:51:45.591 --> 00:51:46.712]  That's what they're after, you see.

[00:54:09.702 --> 00:54:11.803]  Waging war on corruption!
[00:54:13.924 --> 00:54:18.007]  We're not looking for orders from headquarters, we're going to the sound of the guns.
[00:54:19.191 --> 00:54:22.654]  My big guns are the people of this planet standing up against tyranny.
[00:54:23.215 --> 00:54:26.398]  Go to InfoWars.net or PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:54:26.498 --> 00:54:29.761]  Ron Paul on course to raise millions in one day.
[00:54:30.262 --> 00:54:33.985]  November 5th, Money Bomb explodes into action.
[00:54:33.985 --> 00:54:34.566]  We're good to go.
[00:54:58.167 --> 00:55:05.153]  One million for the day, and have continued to rocket towards the two million mark throughout the morning.
[00:55:05.754 --> 00:55:07.455]  And by the way, I said I'd get on the phone.
[00:55:07.535 --> 00:55:13.060]  I get so busy I forgot to tell my wife, because she's planning to give, of course, to remind her that she was going to give today.
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:15.722]  So let me see if she answers the phone.
[00:55:15.742 --> 00:55:21.987]  I'm going to call her and tell her, remind her to give, if she was, and then I'd like her to give some more for me.
[00:55:22.007 --> 00:55:24.249]  And then I've got to call other families.
[00:55:24.269 --> 00:55:25.070]  Phone's ringing right now.
[00:55:26.483 --> 00:55:32.304]  And remind them that this is the 5th of November, that is their choice to give the Ron Paul campaign.
[00:55:32.324 --> 00:55:35.705]  I'm going to be giving more than 100, you can be certainly assured of that.
[00:55:36.145 --> 00:55:44.607]  The neocons will squeal with hatred and flop around that I'm not a Chinese general or a convicted dope dealer or that I'm not for open borders and will call me liberal, of course.
[00:55:45.887 --> 00:55:47.547]  She is not answering the phone.
[00:55:47.587 --> 00:55:51.288]  Let us call her little radiation device, cell phone radiating.
[00:55:54.969 --> 00:55:58.571]  I'm just illustrating this, that this is what we've got to do, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:00.373 --> 00:56:03.274]  Because this is already a million and a half as of this morning.
[00:56:04.655 --> 00:56:08.998]  It's rocketing towards the two million mark right now, at time of posting this just a few minutes ago.
[00:56:09.058 --> 00:56:11.139]  Please go dig it, all the way to the top of dig.
[00:56:11.179 --> 00:56:15.562]  These enemies of the Republic, and they really are that, are on there sitting buried as spam, trying to block it out.
[00:56:16.003 --> 00:56:18.064]  Got fifteen hundred spams the other day and they still blocked it.
[00:56:18.084 --> 00:56:20.105]  But that's fine, we're illustrating their censorship.
[00:56:20.285 --> 00:56:24.128]  It's all part of the process to, as they claim it,
[00:56:25.428 --> 00:56:26.209]  She's not answering.
[00:56:27.709 --> 00:56:28.250]  That doesn't matter.
[00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:29.811]  I can go on the PayPal.
[00:56:29.831 --> 00:56:31.832]  I'll probably mess up again and click the wrong button, though.
[00:56:33.733 --> 00:56:34.873]  Oh, boy.
[00:56:34.933 --> 00:56:48.941]  The other news here in front of me, former NFL star, latest to question 9-11 official story, ex-Dallas Cowboy lineman, Stepnowski, tells Indiana newspaper of doubts.
[00:56:48.981 --> 00:56:52.143]  I remember watching him back when I had time to do such things in the mid-90s.
[00:56:53.303 --> 00:57:09.091]  Former Dallas Cowboys and Houston Oilers lineman Mark Stepnoski has become the latest notable public figure to question the government's official 9-11 story, speaking to an Indiana newspaper about his fascination with the 9-11 truth movement and his doubts about holding 7 inside trading and the alleged hijackers.
[00:57:09.371 --> 00:57:18.396]  Stepnoski was a highly regarded defensive lineman in the 1990s, winning two Super Bowls with the Cowboys and was a five-time Pro Bowler, attending the game from 1992 through 1996.
[00:57:18.776 --> 00:57:22.118]  Since his retirement from the game in 2000, he has become politically active.
[00:57:23.055 --> 00:57:34.519]  In an interview with the Indiana-based Erie Times News published yesterday, I want to get a hold of him and get him on, Semnowski speaks at length about his deep research into the events of 9-11 and why the official explanation seems suspect.
[00:57:34.899 --> 00:57:39.240]  And you can read his eloquent comments by linking through the article or reading some of the clips we have up there.
[00:57:40.171 --> 00:57:45.152]  On the site in the third hour, I'm going to read this in its entirety and get into the huge economic news.
[00:57:45.232 --> 00:57:47.833]  We have Dr. Boyd Graves joining us coming up here.
[00:57:47.853 --> 00:57:49.033]  We'll get him on at the 5 after.
[00:57:50.014 --> 00:57:53.555]  But I'll just cover some of the financial news when we get back in the next segment.
[00:57:53.575 --> 00:57:54.295]  That's so important.
[00:57:54.315 --> 00:57:55.515]  We'll get Boyd Graves on after that.
[00:57:55.535 --> 00:57:59.276]  But I'm going to get into more detail in the third hour on that and the war news.
[00:57:59.596 --> 00:58:01.397]  I haven't even gotten into the martial law news.
[00:58:01.417 --> 00:58:02.817]  You want to know what martial law looks like?
[00:58:02.837 --> 00:58:05.298]  Perez Musharraf has done it in Pakistan.
[00:58:06.818 --> 00:58:11.503]  And tens of thousands of people arrested, activist drug off, list of names.
[00:58:13.184 --> 00:58:16.327]  Oh yes, that's all coming up as well.
[00:58:16.988 --> 00:58:27.098]  When we get back, I'm going to get into what's happening at Citigroupen, the biggest consumer bank in the world, on the face of this green planet.
[00:58:28.072 --> 00:58:30.935]  So we shall cover that when we get back.
[00:58:31.335 --> 00:58:33.457]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:33.617 --> 00:58:35.799]  I'm your Info Warrior, Alex Jones.
[00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:39.643]  Engaging the enemy at point-blank range!

[00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:57.274]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.934 --> 00:58:58.995]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.716 --> 00:59:00.816]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.477 --> 00:59:02.278]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.038 --> 00:59:03.999]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.619 --> 00:59:08.502]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.803 --> 00:59:12.846]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.945 --> 00:59:26.209]  Remember, remember, the 5th of November, when Ron Paul, just in the first 12 hours of this day, has raised upwards of $2 million.
[00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:29.750]  I mean, that's a big day for Hillary.
[00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:31.731]  That's a big day for anybody.
[00:59:31.751 --> 00:59:34.051]  And I've got Ron Paul news here stacking up.
[00:59:34.472 --> 00:59:36.652]  Let me give you some Citigroup information.
[00:59:36.712 --> 00:59:38.193]  Ron Paul's meteoric rise.
[00:59:38.673 --> 00:59:43.995]  Web rankings prove Ron Paul is attracting more and more attention, while every other candidate is flat.
[00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:50.944]  On Alexa ratings alone, Ron Paul is rated at 13,494, an 81% growth rate in the last three months.
[00:59:50.964 --> 00:59:53.005]  Hillary has never gotten to 13,000 on the web.
[00:59:53.025 --> 00:59:53.946]  I'll give you an example.
[00:59:53.966 --> 00:59:54.706]  Prison Planet's like 10,000.
[00:59:54.926 --> 00:59:55.767]  She's never even gotten to 13,000.
[00:59:55.827 --> 00:59:57.107]  She is at 35,143, or 15, no, 20 plus.
[01:00:12.688 --> 01:00:13.248]  We're good to go.
[01:00:36.273 --> 01:00:52.566]  10 places, 110,000 places behind Ron Paul, and Ron Paul today will be outspending him, will be out raising money more than that piece of trash, that gun-grabbing, open borders promoting, abortion loving, Republican darling!
[01:00:52.586 --> 01:00:54.647]  I mean, what else could he be being that scum-filled?
[01:00:55.708 --> 01:00:59.051]  So, war loving, did I add that part?
[01:00:59.391 --> 01:01:04.555]  Martial law pushing, torture loving, just absolute little mob boss son,
[01:01:05.746 --> 01:01:14.148]  I guess it's better than Nazi son like Schwarzenegger, but... Choices like this... We couldn't make this stuff up either.
[01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:20.849]  How many of our government officials are former Commissar's sons or grandsons or... Mob boss sons or SS officer's sons?
[01:01:20.909 --> 01:01:22.749]  I mean... It's just incredible!
[01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:23.909]  It's a pack of scum!
[01:01:24.489 --> 01:01:26.330]  Literally feeding on us, raping us!
[01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:27.710]  I've had enough of it!
[01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:33.671]  This just in, Ron Paul's campaign will be joining us in about an hour and a half.
[01:01:35.279 --> 01:01:36.199]  So there's that news.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.560]  I had to give you that news.
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:41.042]  Big story up on Infowars.net right now.
[01:01:41.142 --> 01:01:44.804]  Ron Paul on course to raise millions in one day.
[01:01:44.824 --> 01:01:47.525]  And I hope you'll all go in there and get this story out to everybody.
[01:01:47.565 --> 01:01:48.265]  This is the day.
[01:01:48.605 --> 01:01:49.586]  This explains it to them.
[01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:50.686]  This explains it simply.
[01:01:51.006 --> 01:01:51.967]  Why it's important.
[01:01:52.247 --> 01:01:53.027]  Where they donate.
[01:01:53.067 --> 01:01:53.868]  How they donate.
[01:01:54.368 --> 01:01:56.389]  Again, don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:59.070]  Get in there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:00.091]  Hit them hard.
[01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:04.533]  Give the New World Order one super fight here.
[01:02:05.495 --> 01:02:06.396]  Alright, coming up.
[01:02:07.636 --> 01:02:09.237]  I'll have to do this if Boyd Graves is on with us.
[01:02:09.738 --> 01:02:13.540]  Citigroup, Citigroup in deep, deep, deep trouble.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:15.962]  World's biggest bank in crisis meeting.
[01:02:16.542 --> 01:02:19.904]  I came in for dinner Friday night with my family at about 6.30.
[01:02:22.046 --> 01:02:26.108]  My wife had National Petroleum Radio on, fake liberal radio on.
[01:02:26.389 --> 01:02:27.930]  We monitor their propaganda.
[01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:31.232]  Everyone with the fake soothing snake voices like
[01:02:32.176 --> 01:02:33.759]  Like Ka in the Jungle Book.
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.262]  Oh, yes.
[01:02:35.863 --> 01:02:37.045]  Oh, it's so silly.
[01:02:37.125 --> 01:02:39.790]  Everyone's dumping their bank stocks of good banks.
[01:02:40.471 --> 01:02:44.939]  Like Chase Manhattan, Citibank, like, uh...
[01:02:45.974 --> 01:02:52.756]  City group, it makes no sense, these are silly people, just are dumb.
[01:02:52.796 --> 01:02:56.217]  The market's wonderful, the economy's great, inflation's less than 2%.
[01:02:57.597 --> 01:02:59.777]  Pigs fly, the moon is made of cheese.
[01:03:00.518 --> 01:03:02.518]  MPR, ooh!
[01:03:02.858 --> 01:03:10.460]  So they were doing all this, and hypnotizing their audience, I mean it certainly is very listenable radio compared to neocon radio.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.901]  And side issue, the point is,
[01:03:15.569 --> 01:03:19.912]  Well, I went in and I said, oh, there's a reason for that, because just in the last few hours, bank stocks have plunged.
[01:03:19.972 --> 01:03:20.812]  I hadn't taken notice.
[01:03:20.852 --> 01:03:21.673]  I was busy doing other stuff.
[01:03:22.013 --> 01:03:25.775]  Sure enough, I go pull up Financial Times of London, London Telegraph.
[01:03:26.276 --> 01:03:26.816]  It's all there.
[01:03:28.537 --> 01:03:34.561]  Citigroup in total crisis, just gyrating out of control, red-level problems.
[01:03:35.863 --> 01:03:38.604]  Meanwhile, everything's fine.
[01:03:39.484 --> 01:03:41.665]  Look closely into my eyes.
[01:03:41.705 --> 01:03:43.846]  You're getting sleepy.
[01:03:43.866 --> 01:03:46.826]  Oh, NPRs.
[01:03:46.947 --> 01:03:47.687]  What evil.
[01:03:52.668 --> 01:03:54.069]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:55.129 --> 01:03:56.209]  A new world order.
[01:03:56.910 --> 01:04:00.391]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by power.
[01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:03.525]  It's known as the Bilderberg Theory.
[01:04:03.545 --> 01:04:06.868]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[01:04:07.408 --> 01:04:09.850]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:17.935]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:20.931 --> 01:04:25.914]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:29.877]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:30.257 --> 01:04:32.779]  Bill of Rights makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:32.819 --> 01:04:33.780]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.700]  They're not after money.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:35.841]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:36.041 --> 01:04:36.782]  They're after power.
[01:04:37.042 --> 01:04:37.702]  That's what happens.

[01:05:53.864 --> 01:05:59.047]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:05:59.207 --> 01:06:00.548]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:06:00.808 --> 01:06:08.993]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:06:09.213 --> 01:06:14.937]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:06:15.117 --> 01:06:16.878]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:06:16.958 --> 01:06:19.160]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:23.503]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:06:23.663 --> 01:06:25.845]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:06:25.905 --> 01:06:33.791]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:06:33.831 --> 01:06:50.939]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305 at 866-295-5305, or order online at hbextract.com, hearth and body extract, 866-295-5305, or hbextract.com.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:57.963]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.047 --> 01:07:02.529]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:03.309]  until 2 p.m.
[01:07:03.369 --> 01:07:05.230]  Central Time at 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:05.691]  Eastern.
[01:07:06.071 --> 01:07:08.072]  We're here live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:08.112 --> 01:07:15.957]  You can also subscribe to the free podcast with a simple click of a mouse at InfoWars.com in the listen section.
[01:07:17.213 --> 01:07:31.756]  And I know a lot of you do subscribe, over 40,000 of you, but why not tell your neighbors, your friends, your office staff, your co-workers, your colleagues, that they can listen how they want, when they want on their MP3 or other type iPod device.
[01:07:32.217 --> 01:07:34.437]  And we restream the show consecutively.
[01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:41.799]  Every day when the show ends at 2 o'clock Central, we restream it, so if you missed any of the first or second hour, you can always tune in and listen to the stream.
[01:07:42.059 --> 01:07:43.479]  So listen how you want, when you want.
[01:07:43.519 --> 01:07:46.240]  It's all about ease of listening in the information war.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:46.600]  Okay.
[01:07:48.766 --> 01:07:55.348]  I should have had the good doctor on years ago, but quite frankly, I wanted to do more research on his claims.
[01:07:55.848 --> 01:08:08.993]  In fact, once I even set him up and then rudely cancelled him, because I said, this is such a serious allegation, about ten years ago, he may remember, probably doesn't, such a serious allegation that he's making that I want to do research.
[01:08:09.053 --> 01:08:11.394]  Well, you get busy, you do a lot of things.
[01:08:12.214 --> 01:08:15.979]  In the last 10 years I have read more than 20-30 books on the subject.
[01:08:16.039 --> 01:08:16.921]  I quit counting.
[01:08:17.381 --> 01:08:21.827]  I've actually gone to state libraries, university libraries.
[01:08:23.329 --> 01:08:29.357]  I have actually interviewed scores of other medical doctors, scientists, epidemiologists, virologists.
[01:08:30.408 --> 01:08:36.850]  And I have seen what Nobel Prize winners have just said in the last year, two separate ones saying age is an inside job.
[01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:49.274]  Of course, then many other scientists and guests out of the blue and news articles would bring up the documents in the 1970s that they independently discovered about the Navy and others developing race-specific bioweapons.
[01:08:49.714 --> 01:08:52.135]  Since then, I've read in its entirety and then the different
[01:08:53.408 --> 01:08:54.188]  I don't know.
[01:09:16.457 --> 01:09:20.479]  And quite frankly, I discovered things even worse than what Dr. Graves is saying.
[01:09:20.519 --> 01:09:22.299]  So I have to tell you, he was right all along.
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:31.663]  It's just there's so many incredible guests, so many incredible researchers, so many incredible things that I just don't have time to vet and prove for myself before I bring them on the show.
[01:09:32.586 --> 01:09:38.850]  I really, I guess, would just put people on the show beforehand and just say, I haven't documented what they've said, instead of waiting 10 years.
[01:09:39.351 --> 01:09:40.311]  Same thing with chemtrails.
[01:09:40.351 --> 01:09:43.694]  We've been doing research on that, and then we just discovered that it's true.
[01:09:43.754 --> 01:09:47.116]  There's whole government declassified areas hidden in plain view.
[01:09:47.236 --> 01:09:49.337]  I'm so busy, I haven't even had time over the weekend.
[01:09:49.377 --> 01:09:51.739]  I try to do research, didn't even do an article on it.
[01:09:52.039 --> 01:09:52.720]  It's the problem.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.041]  There are so many tens of thousands.
[01:09:55.081 --> 01:09:57.963]  First off, before we go to Mr. Graves, and I appreciate him joining us, I'm trying to preface all this.
[01:10:02.128 --> 01:10:10.645]  In Endgame, we literally didn't put one one thousandth, maybe not even one ten thousandth, of all the admitted
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:12.321]  Radiating troops.
[01:10:12.421 --> 01:10:13.982]  Spraying with biological weapons.
[01:10:14.082 --> 01:10:14.582]  Killing them.
[01:10:14.662 --> 01:10:15.943]  Killing foster children.
[01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:17.904]  Killing children the government grabbed.
[01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:21.005]  Killing children that parents brought in to have surgery.
[01:10:21.506 --> 01:10:22.386]  Radiating them.
[01:10:22.466 --> 01:10:23.427]  Hundreds of thousands.
[01:10:23.487 --> 01:10:25.848]  I mean, you... It's so... And that's just the U.S.
[01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:27.889]  and Israel and Russia and England and a few others.
[01:10:28.529 --> 01:10:31.731]  And then, South Africa creating race-specific bioweapons.
[01:10:31.791 --> 01:10:32.972]  And Jane's Weapons Quarterly.
[01:10:33.012 --> 01:10:36.854]  And Dick Cheney writing about how they wanted to use them on people and make it legitimate.
[01:10:36.894 --> 01:10:37.935]  PENAC document, September 2000.
[01:10:39.981 --> 01:10:45.628]  I mean, the point is, is that you literally jump into an ocean of them admitting it, an ocean of them doing it.
[01:10:45.688 --> 01:10:49.753]  They see it as their great work, their charity, their loving thing.
[01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:58.944]  We just posted The Rabbit Hole Part 2, Endgame, The Rabbit Hole Doesn't End Here Part 2 at TruthNews.us this weekend that a great writer put together.
[01:10:59.978 --> 01:11:02.040]  Put together all the research that we'd seen independently.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:06.743]  They did even more with the head of Planned Parenthood being Bill Gates's dad.
[01:11:07.744 --> 01:11:14.909]  Admitting the Rockefeller Foundation runs it all at public speeches, video, audio of it.
[01:11:14.929 --> 01:11:18.852]  $39 billion given just in the last year by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett for all of this.
[01:11:19.392 --> 01:11:21.314]  I mean, this is huge!
[01:11:22.615 --> 01:11:27.018]  And so it's basically like I'm trying to give you the history of the world here in a thumbnail.
[01:11:27.722 --> 01:11:35.966]  But I guess the best way to do it is Dr. Boyd Graves, who's one of the first to discover this, to be speaking out against it and exposing it.
[01:11:37.347 --> 01:11:42.750]  And again, AIDS infests almost every nation in the world.
[01:11:43.690 --> 01:11:47.212]  Some countries in Africa have 40 plus percent rates of it.
[01:11:48.093 --> 01:11:54.496]  You'll see somebody like, you know, you can debate what cures it, what treats it all day, but bottom line, it's a government op.
[01:11:55.399 --> 01:12:00.241]  Remember Magic Johnson said he had it and was going to die, and then suddenly, oh I'm fine, I got the cure, and then they told him to shut up?
[01:12:00.721 --> 01:12:02.242]  Remember Tommy Morris and the boxer?
[01:12:02.662 --> 01:12:04.523]  If you take the drugs, that ends up killing you.
[01:12:05.283 --> 01:12:13.827]  There's people, they've done medical tests, even the BBC admits they've done an age test in Africa on people that have never had sex, never had anything, but they've been given an injection, and that's where they got it.
[01:12:14.167 --> 01:12:19.889]  So I'm going to shut up now and go to Dr. Boyd Graves, who I'll even keep over to the next hour for the time I've taken from him here.
[01:12:20.309 --> 01:12:22.730]  Prefacing all this, all I can beg you to do is
[01:12:24.895 --> 01:12:25.636]  We're good to go.
[01:12:43.436 --> 01:12:49.438]  But they can get away with it in Latin America and Africa and poor areas of Asia better because there's no real media, no reporting.
[01:12:49.458 --> 01:12:51.559]  They own the governments through IMF and World Bank loans.
[01:12:51.799 --> 01:12:53.560]  They say through IMF and World Bank loans.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:59.422]  They'll buy the quietness, the silence of the country's leadership that are doing this.
[01:12:59.862 --> 01:13:01.163]  This is it.
[01:13:01.223 --> 01:13:02.443]  It's going on now.
[01:13:03.644 --> 01:13:07.726]  And please get Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:13:08.706 --> 01:13:11.287]  They admit they've killed hundreds of thousands of us by design.
[01:13:12.399 --> 01:13:13.900]  Why wouldn't they do something like this?
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.101]  Why wouldn't they do a 9-11?
[01:13:15.121 --> 01:13:16.902]  Well, then you find the documents and indeed they are.
[01:13:17.302 --> 01:13:27.408]  So I think the best way to start this is just to tell you that Dr. Boyd Graves, AIDS activist, 11 years ago, Boyd Graves, a lawyer and 1975 graduate of the U.S.
[01:13:27.428 --> 01:13:30.070]  Naval Academy, discovered he had HIV AIDS positive.
[01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:33.452]  Rather than lay down and accept it as a death sentence, he resolved to learn
[01:13:34.523 --> 01:13:36.565]  All he could about the disease in hopes of seeking a cure.
[01:13:36.806 --> 01:13:38.768]  What Graves discovered shocked and enraged him.
[01:13:39.128 --> 01:13:44.193]  Based upon information he discovered in the public domain, and through the Freedom of Information Act, he concluded the U.S.
[01:13:44.213 --> 01:13:50.560]  government was involved in a super-secret special virus cancer program, and now declassified, by the way.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:54.024]  He feels it is the cause of the dreaded disease HIV-AIDS.
[01:13:54.864 --> 01:14:06.391]  99 Graves discovered the secret 71 special virus center flowchart which spells out the incremental development of a laboratory produced virus designed to attack and undermine the immune system of people of African descent.
[01:14:06.891 --> 01:14:09.192]  And again, my dad is an oral surgeon.
[01:14:09.212 --> 01:14:10.793]  He knows a lot of doctors, medical doctors.
[01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:13.455]  I remember him in the 80s talking about this.
[01:14:14.508 --> 01:14:30.215]  Chan, he's seen the numbers from the CDC that white men or white women who have just as many sexual partners, they could even be black partners who have AIDS, are hundreds of times less likely to contract it, but blacks can almost catch it from somebody sneezing on them.
[01:14:30.755 --> 01:14:32.335]  So the point is, it's race-specific.
[01:14:33.216 --> 01:14:34.016]  And there's no doubt.
[01:14:34.216 --> 01:14:34.997]  But I've said enough.
[01:14:35.457 --> 01:14:36.397]  There's so much here.
[01:14:37.237 --> 01:14:39.258]  He's done so much to expose it.
[01:14:39.478 --> 01:14:40.699]  And I salute you, Mr. Graves.
[01:14:42.498 --> 01:14:50.141]  My friend, I do not know if I have ever had a more glorious introduction than that which you just did.
[01:14:50.261 --> 01:14:51.021]  Thank you so much.
[01:14:51.281 --> 01:14:52.121]  Well, thank you for coming on.
[01:14:52.161 --> 01:14:56.623]  In a nutshell, tell us a little bit more about yourself and this horrific saga.
[01:14:57.183 --> 01:15:00.944]  I mean, I've had to come face to face... Well, you know, let's get going here, my friend.
[01:15:01.925 --> 01:15:06.206]  I'm about to celebrate my sixth anniversary on taking the AIDS cure.
[01:15:06.226 --> 01:15:08.267]  Let's start at the beginning.
[01:15:08.607 --> 01:15:09.627]  The AIDS cure is U.S.
[01:15:09.667 --> 01:15:10.248]  patent number 56.
[01:15:12.972 --> 01:15:26.879]  7-6 9-7-7 Anyone who's listening now, and I know that this is the world jury, can go to www.uspto.gov.
[01:15:27.179 --> 01:15:31.081]  That's the patent and trademark office database of the United States of America.
[01:15:31.922 --> 01:15:33.963]  What we are talking about here, Alex, are U.S.
[01:15:34.023 --> 01:15:34.503]  documents.
[01:15:36.684 --> 01:15:38.125]  Dr. Boyd Ed Braves can read.
[01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:42.036]  We're talking about U.S.
[01:15:42.096 --> 01:15:43.417]  documents and nothing more.
[01:15:44.797 --> 01:15:48.779]  Unfortunately, I believed I had a right to life.
[01:15:50.819 --> 01:15:56.421]  The development of HIV preceded my birth as well as yours and that of virtually every other person in this country.
[01:15:58.802 --> 01:16:01.403]  There is something wrong in the henhouse.
[01:16:03.023 --> 01:16:04.444]  There is something wrong in the henhouse.
[01:16:05.344 --> 01:16:08.865]  This plan to develop HIV, a race-specific entity,
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:15.182]  Precedes a number of centuries, apparently, to my understanding.
[01:16:16.982 --> 01:16:21.624]  What we're looking at here is the CCR5 Delta 32 positive gene.
[01:16:22.305 --> 01:16:23.845]  All people of color have the gene.
[01:16:24.605 --> 01:16:25.826]  Many whites do not.
[01:16:26.326 --> 01:16:30.308]  And when I say that, please know that I am not speaking racially.
[01:16:30.528 --> 01:16:33.029]  That you this, or me that, or you this, or me that.
[01:16:33.609 --> 01:16:36.310]  We are speaking about actionable intelligence.
[01:16:38.593 --> 01:16:43.819]  As it relates to solving the greatest mystery in the history of the world.
[01:16:45.721 --> 01:16:47.003]  And it will take all of us.
[01:16:49.165 --> 01:16:57.655]  Anyone who knows me, Alex, knows that we're about equally trying to share the air and the space.
[01:16:58.368 --> 01:16:58.908]  Absolutely.
[01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:00.629]  But listen, you don't have to preface it with my audience.
[01:17:00.669 --> 01:17:03.470]  They understand what the race-specific bio-weapons are all about.
[01:17:03.630 --> 01:17:05.971]  I mean, but let's start back at... How did you wake up to this?
[01:17:06.551 --> 01:17:07.591]  Let's get into the documents.
[01:17:07.631 --> 01:17:08.331]  What you discovered?
[01:17:09.032 --> 01:17:10.152]  Well, here's what we discovered.
[01:17:10.332 --> 01:17:10.632]  The U.S.
[01:17:10.652 --> 01:17:21.116]  Specialized Program from 1962 to 1978 has 15 progress reports detailing every experiment and every contract I can read.
[01:17:21.916 --> 01:17:27.058]  I'm hopeful that the world jury today will want to read these documents also.
[01:17:28.208 --> 01:17:39.610]  Because they specifically and unequivocally show that the research logic flowchart, the blueprint, that's on my website voidgraves.com, over 4 million people have the document already.
[01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:45.091]  This program developed the ESP-1 virus.
[01:17:45.651 --> 01:17:50.132]  We have the 1971 electron microscope of that ESP-1 virus.
[01:17:51.252 --> 01:17:57.033]  Alex, when compared to the 1985 electron microscope of HIV, as is produced by the National Academy of Sciences,
[01:17:57.731 --> 01:17:58.611]  They are identical.
[01:17:59.732 --> 01:18:03.473]  The ESP-1 virus was produced as the U.S.
[01:18:03.513 --> 01:18:11.536]  special virus program in accordance with the prime mandate long directive of reducing the black population.
[01:18:11.756 --> 01:18:22.960]  You've already mentioned a number of the documents of the United States which clearly show the mix of eugenics as if you would racism if you went into the biological programs.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:31.802]  This whole development of infectious disease, including the 1918 influenza, they already knew what they were doing at that point.
[01:18:32.102 --> 01:18:32.822]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:18:32.842 --> 01:18:39.683]  That's what I discovered researching eugenics is a hundred years ago, the Rockefellers started funding all the cancer research as a weapon.
[01:18:40.043 --> 01:18:40.803]  Stay there, sir.
[01:18:41.223 --> 01:18:44.784]  We're going to come right back to you on the other side of this break to get into these documents.
[01:18:45.144 --> 01:18:47.565]  And again, as you say, these are documents that are official.
[01:18:47.945 --> 01:18:48.745]  Anybody can read them.
[01:18:52.563 --> 01:18:53.024]  Gold.
[01:18:53.324 --> 01:18:54.626]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:18:54.886 --> 01:19:00.974]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:19:01.155 --> 01:19:05.000]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:07.223]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:19:07.263 --> 01:19:07.443]  Mint,
[01:19:07.483 --> 01:19:08.424]  We're good to go.
[01:19:30.179 --> 01:19:30.599]  We're good to go.
[01:19:52.248 --> 01:19:55.590]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN Financial Bulletin.
[01:19:55.890 --> 01:20:00.914]  Have you ever wanted to make a lot of extra cash in a way that requires very little money to get started?
[01:20:01.314 --> 01:20:06.457]  If so, and you have a high-speed internet connection, this may well be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:07.278]  Here's why.
[01:20:07.478 --> 01:20:15.483]  You can now get a free DVD that reveals how to make more money than any sane person can possibly spend, and do it while working part-time at home.
[01:20:15.843 --> 01:20:16.184]  I'm good to go.
[01:20:35.469 --> 01:20:36.190]  I think so.
[01:20:52.071 --> 01:20:54.833]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[01:20:55.174 --> 01:21:01.659]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription fill.
[01:21:01.999 --> 01:21:03.661]  That's over 46% savings!
[01:21:04.021 --> 01:21:06.303]  The average savings for generic drugs was over 71%.
[01:21:08.104 --> 01:21:16.589]  RxDrugCard.com is the only major discount prescription drug plan that offers a price lookup page, so you can get an idea of your discounted price before you enroll.

[01:21:44.846 --> 01:21:45.066]  That's 888-216-2461.
[01:21:45.086 --> 01:21:45.747]  Do it today!
[01:21:51.841 --> 01:21:53.962]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:21:54.322 --> 01:21:57.403]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:21:57.643 --> 01:22:02.225]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:05.206]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:22:05.686 --> 01:22:12.428]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:22:12.888 --> 01:22:18.110]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:22:18.571 --> 01:22:20.211]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:22:20.732 --> 01:22:24.013]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:22:24.593 --> 01:22:27.935]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[01:22:27.975 --> 01:22:34.958]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[01:22:35.318 --> 01:22:40.700]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.381]  Share the oil company's secrets
[01:22:42.521 --> 01:22:43.562]  Pienso que un sueño parasito no volverá más.
[01:22:43.622 --> 01:22:45.082]  Que me pintaba las manos y la cara de azul.
[01:22:45.102 --> 01:22:46.523]  Y de provista le vine para ti, dame debo.
[01:23:12.391 --> 01:23:23.499]  Dr. Boyd Graves is our guest.
[01:23:23.679 --> 01:23:26.601]  Website BoydGraves.com.
[01:23:26.641 --> 01:23:29.543]  Big link up on Infowars.com.
[01:23:30.224 --> 01:23:32.325]  And I know a lot of you are racist.
[01:23:32.366 --> 01:23:34.487]  You don't like black people, so you snicker and giggle.
[01:23:34.527 --> 01:23:36.429]  Some of you out there and say, ah, just let them die.
[01:23:36.869 --> 01:23:40.712]  I want you to go look at the photos and the video of those dead and dying children and those people.
[01:23:41.292 --> 01:23:45.754]  And I want you to look at those human beings and think about what you're tacitly giving approval to.
[01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:47.115]  But that's a small minority.
[01:23:47.475 --> 01:23:49.315]  Most of you just don't believe this is going on.
[01:23:49.396 --> 01:23:52.437]  Understand, an elite that will do this will kill anybody and everybody.
[01:23:53.217 --> 01:23:55.458]  And my evidence shows they're doing it to everyone.
[01:23:55.818 --> 01:23:58.639]  They're trying to dumb everyone down so we're more easily controlled.
[01:23:58.659 --> 01:23:59.740]  They're poisoning us all.
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:09.344]  But they lavish this wickedness on blacks first in Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa mainly, and on Asians and Latin Americans.
[01:24:10.325 --> 01:24:17.807]  And then Bayer, knowingly, for 10 years, shipped out Factor VIII with AIDS in every shot, knowing it would kill everyone that came in contact with it.
[01:24:18.087 --> 01:24:20.308]  And their CEO's own minutes and suits came out.
[01:24:20.408 --> 01:24:20.928]  They knew!
[01:24:21.388 --> 01:24:23.069]  They said, oh, they just were cold-hearted and didn't care.
[01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.389]  No!
[01:24:23.849 --> 01:24:25.770]  They do it as a sacrament.
[01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:28.931]  It is their thought system.
[01:24:29.311 --> 01:24:36.353]  Dr. Graves, short segment, but just get into documents, I mean, because you've got the cold, hard facts and the pieces you've put together here.
[01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:38.711]  Well, I appreciate that.
[01:24:38.811 --> 01:24:41.672]  Again, let me just say that these are U.S.
[01:24:41.753 --> 01:24:49.897]  documents and each and every one of us, now that we are a world jury, we want to see the evidence and then weigh it for ourselves.
[01:24:50.657 --> 01:24:53.559]  I believe that anyone Googles U.S.
[01:24:53.639 --> 01:25:04.165]  House Resolution 15090, you will find the kind of common day language that says they were making HIV.
[01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:06.874]  It is page 129 of that U.S.
[01:25:06.914 --> 01:25:07.775]  House Resolution 15090.
[01:25:09.856 --> 01:25:24.745]  The title is Synthetic Biological Agent, where the United States Pentagon spokesperson is seeking $10 million to make a synthetic biological agent for which no natural immunity exists.
[01:25:25.365 --> 01:25:33.150]  It goes on further to say the agent that they were working on would deplete the immune system so as to allow for the onset of infectious disease.
[01:25:34.187 --> 01:25:39.230]  In addition to the 1971 flowchart document, which is the blueprint of the program, this U.S.
[01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:44.333]  House Resolution 15090 is the crux of the evidence of the people.
[01:25:45.414 --> 01:25:51.057]  It is the definitive definition of HIV and AIDS from 1969 and the seek and the want to make it.
[01:25:51.077 --> 01:26:00.042]  The flowchart shows the desire, the purpose, and the intent, and clearly that a virus particle was isolated and mass-produced under the U.S.
[01:26:00.082 --> 01:26:01.003]  Special Virus Program.
[01:26:01.966 --> 01:26:07.688]  There is one government report on this entire operation that came out of the GAO General Accounting Office.
[01:26:08.188 --> 01:26:16.371]  The Congressman James Trafigan, my Congressman from Ohio, I'm from the Youngstown, Ohio area, and I do want to say hello to all my friends and family in the Youngstown, Cleveland area.
[01:26:16.831 --> 01:26:21.713]  But the GAO origin of the AIDS virus report is also available on Google.
[01:26:23.133 --> 01:26:27.815]  And it shows that they sideswiped in every way and whitewashed this U.S.
[01:26:27.835 --> 01:26:31.336]  special virus program to continue to leave it out of the equation.
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:32.361]  Of course!
[01:26:41.707 --> 01:26:43.528]  We'll solve and end HIV and AIDS.
[01:26:43.728 --> 01:26:51.493]  Now let me go back for a minute, and then we'll come back into the future, but you have a flow chart here, and many of these I came across in researching.
[01:26:51.533 --> 01:26:54.835]  Genetics started with the eugenicists 150 years ago.
[01:26:54.875 --> 01:26:56.756]  They founded the Coal Springs Harbor Lab.
[01:26:57.036 --> 01:26:58.597]  They founded the Bioweapons Lab.
[01:26:59.078 --> 01:27:00.338]  In 1902, the U.S.
[01:27:00.438 --> 01:27:06.242]  organized the Station for Experimental Evolution, and they were able to identify diseases of ethnic nature in 1902.
[01:27:06.942 --> 01:27:08.063]  You're reading from my website?
[01:27:08.726 --> 01:27:08.946]  Yes.
[01:27:09.486 --> 01:27:10.667]  Yes, that's the timeline.
[01:27:10.947 --> 01:27:26.093]  So it allows people of the world jury to have a foothold as they venture back in time to grasp the time frame with respect to the continuous development of a contagious cancer that selectively kills.
[01:27:26.373 --> 01:27:27.493]  The want and the need.
[01:27:27.693 --> 01:27:29.994]  They could have gone to Mexico, Alex, to get slaved.
[01:27:30.214 --> 01:27:31.475]  They did not have to go to Africa.
[01:27:31.635 --> 01:27:32.195]  Isn't that correct?
[01:27:32.757 --> 01:27:36.600]  Yes, it says 1904, we use microplasm to cause an epidemic in horses.
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:40.844]  1910, use microplasm to cause an epidemic in fowl and birds.
[01:27:41.664 --> 01:27:45.207]  And then they formed the Federation of the American Society of Experimental Biology.
[01:27:45.868 --> 01:27:48.290]  1918, the influenza virus kills millions of unsuspecting
[01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:49.230]  We're good to go.
[01:28:11.416 --> 01:28:15.699]  1935 they learned they could crystallize the tobacco microplasm and it could remain infectious.
[01:28:16.039 --> 01:28:18.681]  That's when they basically chemicalized it.
[01:28:19.161 --> 01:28:22.303]  1943 officially began the bio warfare program and it just goes on and on.
[01:28:22.383 --> 01:28:24.225]  Go there, read it right now.
[01:28:24.245 --> 01:28:26.226]  The timeline at boydgraves.com.
[01:28:26.506 --> 01:28:29.908]  And again, in my own research, in their own books, their own documents.
[01:28:29.989 --> 01:28:31.309]  See, that's what's incredible.
[01:28:31.390 --> 01:28:33.431]  Now I'm reading this and I've seen 80% of it.
[01:28:33.571 --> 01:28:35.412]  I haven't seen it all because there's so much research.
[01:28:36.393 --> 01:28:37.053]  Stay there doctor.
[01:28:37.073 --> 01:28:39.075]  I want to come back and go through what their big plan is.
[01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:45.622]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.543 --> 01:28:49.225]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.486 --> 01:28:55.947]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:28:56.167 --> 01:28:58.287]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:28:58.447 --> 01:29:00.908]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:29:01.148 --> 01:29:05.508]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[01:29:05.548 --> 01:29:06.229]  Here's why.
[01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:12.570]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:29:12.810 --> 01:29:18.811]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[01:29:19.051 --> 01:29:19.971]  But they're not cheating.
[01:29:20.191 --> 01:29:24.194]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:29:24.395 --> 01:29:28.718]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:29:28.818 --> 01:29:36.344]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:29:36.384 --> 01:29:36.925]  Get control.
[01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:37.766]  Get relief.
[01:29:37.826 --> 01:29:38.526]  Get some sleep.
[01:29:38.647 --> 01:29:41.850]  Go to www.OutIn90.com.
[01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:45.353]  That's www.OutIn90.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:29:45.373 --> 01:29:45.613]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:53.089]  Hi, Ken.
[01:29:53.150 --> 01:29:53.910]  It's Judy again.
[01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:58.454]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[01:29:58.614 --> 01:30:01.756]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[01:30:01.996 --> 01:30:03.858]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[01:30:04.138 --> 01:30:06.220]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:12.504]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[01:30:12.705 --> 01:30:17.989]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[01:30:18.269 --> 01:30:21.131]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[01:30:21.251 --> 01:30:22.172]  Go KenSolar!
[01:30:23.456 --> 01:30:24.977]  Get the best of both worlds.
[01:30:25.397 --> 01:30:30.541]  Solar power for your household essentials and a backup generator all-in-one.
[01:30:30.701 --> 01:30:32.062]  Perfect for hurricane seasons.
[01:30:32.142 --> 01:30:35.904]  No long gas lines, no fumes and no noise.
[01:30:36.605 --> 01:30:39.267]  Lower your electric bill and be prepared year-round.
[01:30:39.927 --> 01:30:42.269]  Complete solar kits for under $1,200.

[01:30:46.772 --> 01:30:50.594]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[01:30:52.469 --> 01:30:57.974]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:30:58.394 --> 01:31:02.638]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:03.059 --> 01:31:09.925]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:10.345 --> 01:31:17.047]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:17.367 --> 01:31:18.987]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:31:19.288 --> 01:31:22.468]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:22.749 --> 01:31:25.209]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:31:25.509 --> 01:31:32.271]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:32.691 --> 01:31:35.372]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:31:35.632 --> 01:31:38.833]  For more information call BioSolutions toll-free at

[01:31:39.453 --> 01:31:41.295]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:31:41.315 --> 01:31:44.777]  In India, a blueprint for global enslavement, we conclusively proved
[01:32:07.228 --> 01:32:07.788]  We're good to go.
[01:32:25.527 --> 01:32:34.270]  And they can then disguise a cocktail of other bioweapons they're now releasing, a lot of top scientists have said, in Africa and Asia and Latin America, and it becomes like a cover.
[01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:43.912]  And then they can basically take control of it as it unfolds under the guise of the bureaucracy they've grown up around helping all the poor people that have it.
[01:32:45.813 --> 01:32:46.433]  Please get
[01:32:47.410 --> 01:32:49.030]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:32:49.050 --> 01:32:51.271]  Go see it at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:32:51.311 --> 01:32:55.172]  Get a 15 cent a day membership and then burn it to disk.
[01:32:55.272 --> 01:32:56.092]  Give it to people.
[01:32:57.052 --> 01:32:57.292]  Okay?
[01:32:57.332 --> 01:32:58.993]  And then point them at Dr. Boyd Graves' site.
[01:32:59.013 --> 01:33:00.073]  Then they understand.
[01:33:00.133 --> 01:33:00.973]  Here's the global elite.
[01:33:01.073 --> 01:33:01.934]  Here's their own statements.
[01:33:01.974 --> 01:33:03.234]  How they want to kill 80% of us.
[01:33:04.774 --> 01:33:12.016]  And they... I know I'm jumping back and forth here, Dr. Graves, but let me just go back here for a moment.
[01:33:12.842 --> 01:33:14.483]  Why particularly from your research?
[01:33:14.503 --> 01:33:16.924]  Like Bertrand Russell talks about how they've got to exterminate the blacks.
[01:33:16.964 --> 01:33:30.212]  I have the letter, there's a bunch of them, but to the Lever family head, Fortune, where she's talking about we've got to hire black doctors as our front people so the blacks don't catch on that we're trying to exterminate them.
[01:33:32.251 --> 01:33:34.032]  I mean, I know they're doing this to everybody.
[01:33:34.112 --> 01:33:42.635]  I know they're running soft kill ops on everyone now from all the evidence I've got, but particularly, why do they want to kill blacks so badly?
[01:33:45.476 --> 01:33:47.176]  Well, you know, I have a legacy.
[01:33:47.216 --> 01:33:55.699]  I guess I'm developing a legacy of being able to be the AIDS shell answer man, and I certainly would like to tackle that question.
[01:33:57.279 --> 01:34:07.304]  It is difficult for people who have, even as young as this country is, to have related to other persons to view them less equally.
[01:34:08.785 --> 01:34:20.971]  When you have evolved from a mentality that views others as lesser than yourself, and in this case as it relates to whites and blacks as five-fifths and three-fifths, it is very difficult for someone who has been
[01:34:22.006 --> 01:34:25.847]  Viewing people lesser than themselves to subsequently then view them equally.
[01:34:26.728 --> 01:34:30.309]  That would take more time than we've been on the planet, and we're still working on that.
[01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:37.751]  My friend, I believe this entire issue of eliminating the black race goes back a long, long ways.
[01:34:39.512 --> 01:34:49.755]  I think it may even go back as far as the first encounters of the first Caucasoids and the Negroids, however that may have occurred.
[01:34:50.447 --> 01:34:56.911]  Whether it be by Vikings sailing down the coast and encountering the first blacks and going back and saying, we've got to do something.
[01:34:58.012 --> 01:35:09.779]  And I was saying last evening, I always said, you know, blacks grew up in an environment, Africans grew up in an environment where they're in a maze and a matrix of a jungle, but yet they can throw and spit and throw straight lines.
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:12.081]  And the white man cannot do that.
[01:35:12.833 --> 01:35:23.536]  So there might have been a mental inferiority thing that brought this all about from the very beginning, that the African was very, very comfortable in the jungle, and the white man is not.
[01:35:26.317 --> 01:35:34.979]  Well, regardless, this stuff's going on, and I want no part of it, and I know that 99% of the whites I know want no part of it, but people have... Well, here's what we can do.
[01:35:36.204 --> 01:35:38.726]  You have one of the best shows in this country.
[01:35:38.926 --> 01:35:41.848]  We can unite to call for the review of the U.S.
[01:35:41.868 --> 01:35:42.809]  Special Virus Program.
[01:35:43.049 --> 01:35:45.191]  Is that something you yourself are willing to commit to?
[01:35:45.211 --> 01:35:46.332]  Review the U.S.
[01:35:46.352 --> 01:35:51.356]  Special Virus Program and begin the clinical trials of the patented cure for AIDS.
[01:35:51.596 --> 01:35:53.878]  So as we say, where do we go from here?
[01:35:54.198 --> 01:35:57.700]  Well, I certainly, Dr. Graves, have reviewed the development of it.
[01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:01.482]  It's in all these different documents, State Department documents.
[01:36:01.582 --> 01:36:04.084]  It's all there that they developed this and are using it.
[01:36:04.604 --> 01:36:07.525]  But, again, huge things get hidden in plain view.
[01:36:07.586 --> 01:36:12.368]  I mean, as for treatments and others, there's quite a few of them out there, and I'm not even here debating all that.
[01:36:12.388 --> 01:36:15.430]  Alex, you are not hidden.
[01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:18.932]  You are one of the most exposed radio talk show hosts in the world.
[01:36:19.432 --> 01:36:29.319]  With your help here today, the people who listen to you and who know that you bring the truth, go to BoydGraves.com, download the flowchart document.
[01:36:29.599 --> 01:36:35.223]  It is our petition calling card for the jury of the world, sir, for review of this U.S.
[01:36:35.243 --> 01:36:42.889]  special program and for the beginning of the immediate clinical trials of the patented tetracell cure
[01:36:43.723 --> 01:36:58.048]  Well, I agree with you, and I'm going to give you time to go over the solution today, sir, and I want to spend some time on that, but for my audience and even myself, continue, I mean, let's start at the beginning, man, and just in a nutshell, if you can, condense it.
[01:37:12.888 --> 01:37:17.649]  Because everywhere I look, I mean, it's the Rockefellers developing viruses that spread them.
[01:37:17.689 --> 01:37:18.449]  Let me address that.
[01:37:19.569 --> 01:37:26.571]  What you are talking about are the underpinnings of why indeed there were secret societies in and of themselves even so long ago.
[01:37:26.891 --> 01:37:36.413]  That underneath this whole whirlwind of what we call spin and a world was this mental ideology, and I call it inferiority, of the Caucasoid race.
[01:37:37.358 --> 01:37:46.042]  To indeed plot, to plan, to figure out the difference between these people and us, as they have done so biologically, and have acted on it.
[01:37:46.423 --> 01:38:01.750]  And it all goes back to this long-standing secret society, them-versus-us mentality that the white man and woman, per se, has engaged in only because of the tilt of the playing field.
[01:38:02.271 --> 01:38:03.972]  Well, let me expand on that.
[01:38:05.362 --> 01:38:10.004]  I mean, the secret societies of the New World Order, all they are is the ancient intelligence agencies to guard knowledge.
[01:38:10.285 --> 01:38:18.309]  They always thought they were better than everybody, even if they were Roman, and it was other Romans, or if it was Germans.
[01:38:18.369 --> 01:38:26.253]  I mean, so I agree that it's all about elitism, and so of course then that will flow out and into people who are other than non-white.
[01:38:26.954 --> 01:38:32.439]  And, but my friend, it extends itself to who has the power and the control, i.e.
[01:38:32.459 --> 01:38:44.148]  the modern intelligent societies are of the highest order, all a mixture of the project paperclip importation of the Nazi science and ideology, nothing more and nothing less.
[01:38:44.688 --> 01:38:47.791]  But as you said, this goes back over a hundred years.
[01:38:47.971 --> 01:38:53.796]  Okay, well let's go back, let's go back to 1843, when we discovered that it is the tobacco plant.
[01:38:54.236 --> 01:38:57.637]  The tobacco mosaic virus, as the grandmother of HIV and AIDS.
[01:38:57.657 --> 01:38:58.137]  Go over it.
[01:38:58.197 --> 01:38:58.617]  Go over it.
[01:38:59.497 --> 01:38:59.697]  Sir?
[01:39:00.178 --> 01:39:01.078]  Yeah, go ahead and go over it.
[01:39:01.658 --> 01:39:05.299]  Well, again, they discovered in 1843 the mycoplasma.
[01:39:05.679 --> 01:39:09.640]  Indeed, we find mycoplasmas have been transferred from plant to animal to human.
[01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:15.022]  The HIV enzyme is a mycoplasma with a sheep sequences from Iceland, my friend.
[01:39:15.302 --> 01:39:19.283]  How does a disease that comes out of Africa have sheep sequences from Iceland?
[01:39:20.783 --> 01:39:21.703]  But this is no virus.
[01:39:21.783 --> 01:39:25.505]  BISNA has 28% of the sequences of HIV and AIDS.
[01:39:25.865 --> 01:39:31.686]  Yet, this government propagates that some African and some monkey, some Haitian and some bloody, somebody and somebody?
[01:39:31.987 --> 01:39:34.287]  No, indeed, all of this has been done in the laboratory, sir.
[01:39:34.487 --> 01:39:38.289]  And that's what that protart document proves, that it was by design and purpose.
[01:39:38.549 --> 01:39:39.789]  We need to address this issue.
[01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:42.130]  But please continue.
[01:39:42.190 --> 01:39:46.071]  I mean, how they developed the whole biological weapons program is just older than most people know.
[01:39:46.846 --> 01:39:53.611]  Well, it's truly that it's older, but what we're saying, so it's just a general principle here, is that it is aimed at people of color.
[01:39:53.991 --> 01:40:05.540]  They're predicting the next AIDS, Alex, by the year 2012, coming through the air like your chemtrails, based on your hair color and your eye color, triggering a faster kind of AIDS-like SARS-like avian disease.
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:14.487]  No, no, I agree, and notice that Dr. Eric Bianca, UT, says he can't wait for the airborne virus that's going to wipe everybody out.
[01:40:15.103 --> 01:40:20.046]  Well, sir, the airborne violence is a result of the aerobiology programs of the United States of America.
[01:40:20.326 --> 01:40:29.311]  If the people review the aerobiology programs of the United States of America, we'll see, indeed, the effing nature of some of the chemtrails that you so highly speak of yourself.
[01:40:29.511 --> 01:40:32.393]  The chemtrails are just a portion of the aerobiology.
[01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:37.996]  Indeed, if they can blow it through the air, it's a whole lot easier than tearing down the skyscrapers, sir.
[01:40:38.236 --> 01:40:38.697]  Sure, sure.
[01:40:38.737 --> 01:40:39.957]  It's airborne.
[01:40:40.478 --> 01:40:40.858]  I hear ya.
[01:40:43.594 --> 01:40:50.043]  Bring me to the point of when you discovered that you supposedly had AIDS, and then you started researching, and you finally started talking about it.
[01:40:50.083 --> 01:40:57.112]  Well, that's fifteen years ago, and I hate digressing to this extent, because we're so forward-thinking in how we're going to approach this.
[01:40:57.192 --> 01:40:59.515]  I understand, but it's important to give folks the background here.
[01:41:00.009 --> 01:41:00.590]  Yeah, sure.
[01:41:00.630 --> 01:41:02.971]  Well, you know, all of that's on the website.
[01:41:03.152 --> 01:41:04.533]  The background is the future, sir.
[01:41:04.813 --> 01:41:06.054]  The cure for AIDS is U.S.
[01:41:06.114 --> 01:41:07.755]  patent number 567-6977.
[01:41:08.736 --> 01:41:12.399]  Personally, Alex, I took it six years ago, November 19, 2001.
[01:41:12.959 --> 01:41:17.963]  This is my sixth anniversary on the one dose of the AIDS cure, patent number 567-6977.
[01:41:18.063 --> 01:41:25.569]  Yeah, but you've already been, you've already, I mean, had it years before that, so, so, that's another issue.
[01:41:26.129 --> 01:41:27.790]  Well, yes, sir, they tried to cover it.
[01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:29.872]  People die so quickly in Africa, but they don't
[01:41:29.872 --> 01:41:30.232]  Hell yeah!
[01:41:30.953 --> 01:41:33.995]  Well, you know, we're not talking about the beginning of the pandemic anymore, sir.
[01:41:34.555 --> 01:41:35.896]  This is my 15th year.
[01:41:36.376 --> 01:41:40.959]  Back when I was diagnosed, whether it was a false positive or not, I'm willing to debate.
[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:46.703]  But when you were given that diagnosis in 1992, sir, you only had a year and a half to live.
[01:41:46.963 --> 01:41:48.044]  It was all by design.
[01:41:48.384 --> 01:41:55.849]  It shows the true, as you say, evil, inherent nature of a false government with a curtain of eight.
[01:41:56.348 --> 01:41:59.951]  But we are now waking up from the poppy fields of HIV and AIDS.
[01:42:00.252 --> 01:42:04.155]  The people are now seeing the evidence and assessing it for themselves.
[01:42:04.536 --> 01:42:06.377]  The whole world is a jury.
[01:42:06.738 --> 01:42:10.041]  The people that were robed, that tried out of our government here in the United States,
[01:42:10.891 --> 01:42:12.192]  They simply cannot win.
[01:42:12.412 --> 01:42:15.474]  The people can read, and the people are reacting and understanding.
[01:42:15.755 --> 01:42:17.256]  We are awakening from the poppy field.
[01:42:17.276 --> 01:42:17.836]  No, I understand.
[01:42:17.896 --> 01:42:19.958]  People are awakening, and I am seeing that.
[01:42:19.978 --> 01:42:23.020]  I mean, most people you talk to on the street, I mean, it's common knowledge.
[01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:25.001]  They can't tell you why they know.
[01:42:25.041 --> 01:42:28.344]  They just heard that age was manufactured in a lab.
[01:42:28.384 --> 01:42:33.688]  I mean, back in the 80s, back in the early 80s, Frank Zappa said it was engineered.
[01:42:34.288 --> 01:42:37.789]  Well, with your help, sir, there was a parallel program that was ongoing at the time.
[01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:44.132]  These science papers reflect that, I'd be happy to... You know, we're... Now, let's go over the documents and then we'll get off the subject.
[01:42:44.152 --> 01:42:47.213]  We'll give the citations and the references.
[01:42:47.333 --> 01:42:51.894]  A 1971 paper called Special Virus Cancer Program prevails of a biological moonshot.
[01:42:51.954 --> 01:42:52.814]  Anyone can Google it.
[01:42:53.095 --> 01:42:58.737]  We'll show that, indeed, viruses were created under this special virus program in their own time frame.
[01:42:59.037 --> 01:43:02.738]  Now, as we review and try to look back, we know what we're looking for.
[01:43:03.198 --> 01:43:10.265]  The ESP-1 virus created by the United States is a synthetic biological agent that was created that is now what we call HIV.
[01:43:10.526 --> 01:43:13.268]  It is the ESP-1 virus that is HIV.
[01:43:15.551 --> 01:43:17.012]  And how do they make this virus?
[01:43:17.292 --> 01:43:18.253]  What's it made up of?
[01:43:18.814 --> 01:43:24.860]  Well, you know, again, it's the MD Anderson report within Progress Report No.
[01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:25.280]  8 of 1971.
[01:43:27.984 --> 01:43:41.858]  How it's made is, I guess, a plural infusion of something, and I'm not a scientist per se, I'm just a person that has read some of the documentation and tried to regard it as if it would, but something called a plural infusion from a five-year-old black child in Texas.
[01:43:45.762 --> 01:43:46.723]  Okay, explain that to me.
[01:43:47.409 --> 01:43:47.789]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:48.609 --> 01:44:02.114]  The virus particle was isolated in a five-year-old black child in Texas, then developed into the HIV enzyme or the HIV virus as we know it by that name, but it was shipped to Pfizer, the vaccine developer Pfizer, and that's in the progress reports too.
[01:44:02.495 --> 01:44:14.399]  What these progress reports show are a narrative, detailed explanation of how every experiment connects and fits with every other experiment in every contract of the development.
[01:44:16.051 --> 01:44:17.838]  Of the ESP-1 virus.
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:19.546]  Any review of this federal program?
[01:44:21.044 --> 01:44:24.385]  Any cursory review will solve an HIV and AIDS epidemic.
[01:44:24.425 --> 01:44:37.508]  No, I've read the 71 document, and I've read the Navy documents, and I've read where Congress funded the development of autoimmune viruses and successfully developed them, and I've seen the purchase orders where they admit that they developed thousands of gallons of it.
[01:44:38.188 --> 01:44:38.348]  Okay.
[01:44:38.868 --> 01:44:41.529]  And, I mean, as you reported, crystallized so they could then deploy it.
[01:44:41.789 --> 01:44:47.050]  I'm trying to, just for the average person driving along, to make it simpler for them.
[01:44:47.410 --> 01:44:49.831]  Here is for the average person driving along.
[01:44:50.612 --> 01:44:58.494]  In the 2003 State of the Union Address by our President, he stated that AIDS was a plague of nature, and he said that the CIA had reviewed his statement.
[01:44:58.914 --> 01:45:07.137]  Well, AIDS, if AIDS is a plague of nature, then where is my government's synthetic biological agent that was funded on June 9, 1969, that depletes the immune system, sir?
[01:45:09.403 --> 01:45:10.584]  So we can't have it both ways.
[01:45:10.844 --> 01:45:20.708]  Either AIDS is a plague of nature, as we're being led to believe in the propaganda stance, whether it's Democrat or Republican, because we've also approached the prior president on this issue as well, to no avail.
[01:45:21.088 --> 01:45:24.490]  Either AIDS is a plague of nature, or it is a plague of this
[01:45:25.376 --> 01:45:25.716]  I don't know.
[01:45:44.324 --> 01:45:44.804]  I don't know.
[01:46:03.223 --> 01:46:04.583]  No, I'm saying what they are saying.
[01:46:04.723 --> 01:46:10.644]  According to the top electron mycoscopist of the United States, and I'm not sure if I pronounced that one right.
[01:46:10.744 --> 01:46:12.545]  It doesn't matter, go ahead.
[01:46:12.585 --> 01:46:18.166]  Dr. Matthew Gondon, Dr. Robert Gallo, and the National Academy of Science, HIV evolved from the Icelandic sheep disease.
[01:46:18.186 --> 01:46:20.266]  It has nothing to do with monkeys or Africans.
[01:46:20.706 --> 01:46:24.947]  How does an Icelandic sheep disease originate in an African monkey disease?
[01:46:25.027 --> 01:46:25.587]  It just doesn't.
[01:46:25.827 --> 01:46:27.727]  The business sequence is in HIV alone.
[01:46:27.967 --> 01:46:30.568]  But here's the mystery and the miracle, and thank you for asking.
[01:46:30.608 --> 01:46:31.308]  This is very important.
[01:46:32.343 --> 01:46:44.796]  In the progress reports, uh, page 39 in 1971, you have the progress report, you say, they say that Vista has not yet, meaning it will be, but Vista has not yet been associated with human disease.
[01:46:45.817 --> 01:46:54.566]  At the 1983 AIDS task force, and you write this down, sir, the United States was informed that AIDS had evolved, the etiological agent of HIV, on July 18, 1983.
[01:46:56.932 --> 01:46:58.873]  What is the sheep disease?
[01:46:59.273 --> 01:47:11.378]  HIV is a lentivirus because it is one of these mycoplasmas that they have triggered for the last hundred years in line with the horse and the goat as was mentioned by the Cold Springs Harbor discoveries in the early 1900s.
[01:47:12.939 --> 01:47:20.762]  So how could HIV be a mystery if indeed it's linked to animal diseases from the early, early 20th century?
[01:47:21.642 --> 01:47:30.707]  No, and we just had Mr. Watson, the head of the Cold Springs Harbor, who was the head of their genetics arm during World War II, and it was still the Eugenics Records Office.
[01:47:31.267 --> 01:47:41.852]  We now have him, you know, getting finally fired or having to resign because he says black people are basically inferior and we should ban who can have children and restrict this and that.
[01:47:41.872 --> 01:47:43.273]  My point is, Mr. Dr. Grace, please.
[01:47:44.313 --> 01:47:45.014]  No, I understand that.
[01:47:45.354 --> 01:47:49.057]  My point was, Dr. Graves, the issue I was trying to flesh out there
[01:48:04.908 --> 01:48:13.273]  Was that this is a eugenics operation, admittedly, and this is where they're producing these weapons, and they run the Human Genome right now.
[01:48:14.073 --> 01:48:16.234]  Human Genome projects run out of Cold Springs Harbor.
[01:48:16.495 --> 01:48:25.379]  They're with National Geographic trying to trace racial lines out of Africa to try to tailor race weapons, and that's clear.
[01:48:25.399 --> 01:48:31.163]  And so my point is, is that the people heading this up today are still eugenicists, and it's hidden in plain view.
[01:48:31.203 --> 01:48:31.763]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:48:32.415 --> 01:48:34.624]  Well, but it's not a good thing for you.
[01:48:35.336 --> 01:48:38.437]  Any of the scientists and medical doctors today are unaware of the U.S.
[01:48:38.457 --> 01:48:42.578]  Special Violence Program that persisted in the United States from 1962 to 1978.
[01:48:42.798 --> 01:48:44.538]  We're saying review this federal program.
[01:48:44.758 --> 01:48:45.679]  Let's bring it into view.
[01:48:45.939 --> 01:48:47.479]  That's why we're asking for your assistance.
[01:48:47.499 --> 01:48:47.879]  Well, good.
[01:48:47.919 --> 01:48:49.000]  We're going to break.
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:50.020]  We're going to break.
[01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:51.500]  When we come back, you've got the floor.
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:49:00.903]  I want you to tell people your solution to try to get this whole bioweapons program reviewed, but then you say reviewed, they'll look like people calling for a new 9-11 investigation.
[01:49:01.263 --> 01:49:02.023]  They will just
[01:49:03.064 --> 01:49:05.046]  Uh, review it themselves and whitewash it.
[01:49:05.447 --> 01:49:09.311]  But I guess a review would draw attention to this and it would at least be a point of debate.
[01:49:09.612 --> 01:49:11.534]  But I say there's no research needed.
[01:49:11.554 --> 01:49:13.356]  I mean, they said they want the bioweapon.
[01:49:13.597 --> 01:49:15.900]  They said they want to get rid of 80% of the population.
[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:18.983]  They said they want to do it and they're doing it and there it is.
[01:49:19.043 --> 01:49:20.025]  I mean, it's obvious.
[01:49:22.992 --> 01:49:26.473]  When we get back, specifically tell me about Solutions, Dr. Boyd Graves.
[01:49:26.833 --> 01:49:36.336]  Amazing information today, and he's been talking about this for 15 years, and so he's just going over it so quickly, and I understand the frustration.
[01:49:36.697 --> 01:49:40.078]  There's so much detail to every little bit of all of this.
[01:49:41.958 --> 01:49:48.160]  There's so many facets to all of it, but regardless, we have a criminally insane elite who are playing with us like we're labyrinths.
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:50.021]  And by the way, that means all of us.
[01:49:52.737 --> 01:49:54.157]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:54.177 --> 01:49:56.238]  A new world order.
[01:49:56.978 --> 01:50:01.240]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:04.060]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:50:04.701 --> 01:50:06.961]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:50:07.501 --> 01:50:09.942]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:10.662 --> 01:50:18.004]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:21.015 --> 01:50:25.998]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:26.478 --> 01:50:29.960]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:32.862]  Builder Barrett is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:32.902 --> 01:50:33.882]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:33.902 --> 01:50:34.803]  They're not after money.
[01:50:34.843 --> 01:50:35.924]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:36.124 --> 01:50:36.884]  They're after power.
[01:50:37.084 --> 01:50:38.125]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:50:46.629 --> 01:50:49.331]  Endgame, prepped for global enslavement.
[01:50:49.771 --> 01:50:50.952]  You have been warned.
[01:50:52.732 --> 01:51:01.796]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:02.056 --> 01:51:13.280]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:19.322]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:51:19.462 --> 01:51:19.902]  I don't know.
[01:51:37.534 --> 01:51:37.814]  Let's do it!
[01:51:51.832 --> 01:51:53.314]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[01:51:53.655 --> 01:51:59.163]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[01:51:59.663 --> 01:52:07.575]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[01:52:07.935 --> 01:52:08.295]  I think so.
[01:52:31.625 --> 01:52:41.170]  That's 1-800-275-1126 or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, NY 14735.
[01:52:41.930 --> 01:52:45.632]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[01:52:45.672 --> 01:52:50.554]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[01:52:53.295 --> 01:52:58.318]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show!
[01:52:59.071 --> 01:53:01.392]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:03.153 --> 01:53:05.253]  He's got a fire hose of information.
[01:53:05.273 --> 01:53:07.494]  We're trying to drink it out of little pixie straws.
[01:53:07.954 --> 01:53:09.635]  Boydgraves.com.
[01:53:09.875 --> 01:53:14.217]  Boyd, B-O-Y-D, Graves, G-R-A-V-E-S dot com.
[01:53:14.237 --> 01:53:15.237]  Go read his timeline.
[01:53:15.337 --> 01:53:16.358]  Go look at it all.
[01:53:16.878 --> 01:53:17.838]  Excellent information.
[01:53:17.858 --> 01:53:21.279]  And then you'll find out it just opens up into a million different avenues.
[01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:24.901]  But bottom line, sir, I want to commend you for the hard work you've done.
[01:53:25.681 --> 01:53:27.222]  Thank you very much.
[01:53:42.481 --> 01:53:44.141]  Yes sir, and I appreciate that.
[01:53:44.481 --> 01:53:52.803]  You know, we've been out here for a very, very, very long time and didn't know if we would even get anywhere near as we're approaching some degree of a finish line.
[01:53:52.883 --> 01:54:01.465]  That finish line being that this information will continue to circulate, you know, around the world until the end of the world.
[01:54:02.065 --> 01:54:03.526]  And for that we're grateful.
[01:54:04.426 --> 01:54:05.046]  We believe that
[01:54:06.095 --> 01:54:15.278]  The clinical trials of the cure, I think, are very, very important as a means of now immediately supplementing the treatment procedures for people with HIV and AIDS.
[01:54:15.778 --> 01:54:25.602]  It's about a 20-minute procedure, and having shared the effects of it for the last six years, I'm sure others would benefit as well.
[01:54:26.298 --> 01:54:30.842]  That tetrachill, the 5-6-7-6-9-7-7 patent speaks for itself.
[01:54:31.302 --> 01:54:33.464]  If you say there's no cure, then here is your cure.
[01:54:33.804 --> 01:54:36.046]  Now we need to act on it as we're going forward.
[01:54:36.386 --> 01:54:52.199]  The review process will certainly be stubborn and take its time over time, but the world jury of people who can read and understand know that we have put our finger on the pulse of the greatest mystery in the history of the world.
[01:54:52.941 --> 01:54:56.143]  It all boils down to, Alex, when did VIPSNA cross species?
[01:54:56.263 --> 01:54:57.064]  V-I-S-N-A.
[01:54:57.804 --> 01:55:01.006]  When did VIPSNA cross species?
[01:55:01.347 --> 01:55:05.329]  Because there's no way an African and a monkey and a Haitian have been up to Iceland.
[01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:09.032]  So we have Icelandic sheep sequences in HIV.
[01:55:09.592 --> 01:55:12.994]  When did the Icelandic sheep sequences cross into the human genome?
[01:55:13.314 --> 01:55:19.378]  They projected that the SIV, the monkey immunodepressant disease, crossed into the human genome.
[01:55:19.679 --> 01:55:19.999]  However,
[01:55:21.147 --> 01:55:22.947]  Did monkeys modify their behavior?
[01:55:22.967 --> 01:55:34.009]  Did they become, and they certainly didn't use condoms, so did female monkeys then spurn the advances of the male because he might possibly give her a sexual transmission?
[01:55:34.329 --> 01:55:36.210]  Otherwise, we would not have monkeys.
[01:55:36.490 --> 01:55:38.750]  So, how did the monkeys modify HIV?
[01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:39.690]  They never had it.
[01:55:40.110 --> 01:55:44.431]  HIV was not, uh, SIV, the monkey SIV was not isolated until 1980.
[01:55:45.211 --> 01:55:48.212]  We began giving monkeys human injections beginning in 1962.
[01:55:50.413 --> 01:55:52.334]  And re-releasing them back into the wild.
[01:55:53.434 --> 01:56:03.317]  In these zoological laboratories, like Plum Island and others, those are admitted bio-weapons labs trying to get zoological diseases to cross into humans.
[01:56:03.917 --> 01:56:19.242]  Yes, so we agree that the transmission of Visma, in particular, since it was developed by Nazi Germany, sir, in the 1930s on the sheep in Iceland, it shows the totality of the mindset that has sought to develop a race-specific
[01:56:20.211 --> 01:56:26.055]  Virus, if you wish, which is a synthetic biological agent, a mycoplasma, a race-specific mycoplasma.
[01:56:26.375 --> 01:56:28.016]  They have achieved their goal.
[01:56:28.357 --> 01:56:30.258]  It is now our time and our turn.
[01:56:31.132 --> 01:56:38.518]  To address this information from a world jury standpoint and together, the good minds of all of us, work together to implement the cure.
[01:56:38.858 --> 01:56:41.040]  They worked on the AIDS vaccine in 1972.
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:42.061]  We have that experiment.
[01:56:42.421 --> 01:56:45.264]  If the people are ready to solve it and HIV and AIDS, we are ready.
[01:56:45.324 --> 01:56:51.749]  Well sure, because anything the government develops, they also try to simultaneously make a cure for it so they can put the genie back in the bottle.
[01:56:52.481 --> 01:56:56.425]  It's called phase 4a of the 1971 flowchart document.
[01:56:56.445 --> 01:57:00.148]  The flowchart is first located at page 61 in that 1971 report.
[01:57:00.449 --> 01:57:06.054]  The preceding pages we will debate around the world, answer every question as to why we have HSPA.
[01:57:06.074 --> 01:57:07.535]  Stay there, I want to do one more segment.
[01:57:07.555 --> 01:57:10.578]  We've got a break for 60-70 seconds or so and then come back.
[01:57:10.598 --> 01:57:11.679]  But all I know is this.
[01:57:13.801 --> 01:57:15.103]  By exposing age,
[01:57:16.053 --> 01:57:31.259]  And by exposing race-specific bioweapons, and that they are being used and being deployed to great horror and great misery, this may back the globalist off to not launch an even larger phase, as you're right in saying, Doctor, they've said they plan to do.
[01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:37.702]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.

[01:57:53.044 --> 01:57:53.865]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.625 --> 01:57:55.526]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.186 --> 01:57:59.909]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.370 --> 01:58:04.473]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:05.234 --> 01:58:12.920]  If you go up to infowars.com, you can link over to boygraves.com, and he's one of the main people out there that's been exposing the fact that age
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:19.561]  HIV, the supposed virus, is an engineered bioweapon.
[01:58:20.202 --> 01:58:28.785]  Sir, from my research, it's clear that they're also using AIDS as kind of an umbrella for other bioweapons that they've been testing around the world.
[01:58:28.805 --> 01:58:29.886]  Do you concur with that statement?
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:42.190]  Well, you know Alex, of course it appears that for the last hundred years we have had an enhanced science ability to engage ourselves in recombinant sciences.
[01:58:42.590 --> 01:58:48.716]  This is a matter of recombinant genetics where, according to the United States Recombinant Identification Program,
[01:58:49.616 --> 01:58:53.058]  They go through and can tell you which viruses have been recombined, i.e.
[01:58:53.438 --> 01:58:55.579]  which ones are man-made and which ones are not.
[01:58:55.919 --> 01:59:01.181]  According to Dr. Robert Strecker, he broke this story back in the 80s, that HIV was a bio-weapon.
[01:59:02.121 --> 01:59:08.704]  They're now, in ICY, they're saying that apparently all virology is man-made.
[01:59:10.327 --> 01:59:12.329]  So, what do they know and when do they know it?
[01:59:12.509 --> 01:59:27.483]  You know, we're getting ready to even go back and look at the bubonic plague area as to how this racial deletion and the gene sequences between black and white had something to do with the bubonic plague where Europeans became negative on that gene site.
[01:59:28.344 --> 01:59:31.287]  And now it is the gene site that adds on the positive side.
[01:59:31.787 --> 01:59:32.868]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:59:53.109 --> 02:00:14.470]  Do you agree though that by exposing the fact that these things exist, that they've been developed, and that the government then also writes documents about how they want to use them and reduce population, I mean, to me it's hidden in plain view, it's right there, that by exposing this, this may keep them from launching more attacks?
[02:00:15.163 --> 02:00:32.209]  Well, I believe that that certainly would be true, but I believe it's even more maybe important to get to the root cause of the problem, and then that may be the events back in 1776, May 1, the Rothschild group got together, and then on July 4, 1776, they formed a corporation.
[02:00:32.569 --> 02:00:38.291]  If I don't have a right to life, I need a space, an area, where I might be able to seek to exhibit that right.
[02:00:38.511 --> 02:00:43.893]  It appears that I do not have a constitutional right to life, and I'm going to try to keep fighting and hope others will join the cause.
[02:00:44.213 --> 02:00:45.934]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[02:00:45.974 --> 02:00:47.075]  Thank you very much Alex.
[02:01:08.446 --> 02:01:12.730]  I ran into all of it, or most of it, in my own research, from their own words.
[02:01:12.770 --> 02:01:24.482]  It's not like we're saying globalists want to kill us, or we're saying they've developed race-specific bioweapons, or we're saying they developed AIDS, because we think so, and we found that idea under a toadstool.
[02:01:26.588 --> 02:01:27.248]  They say it.
[02:01:27.469 --> 02:01:28.029]  They write it.
[02:01:28.209 --> 02:01:28.769]  They do it.
[02:01:28.949 --> 02:01:29.690]  They're into it.
[02:01:29.810 --> 02:01:30.490]  They're pushing it.
[02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:37.673]  And then they come out with this whole new generation of super viruses that are so engineered that, oh, it cures you from using drugs.
[02:01:37.713 --> 02:01:39.294]  It goes into each part of your brain.
[02:01:39.855 --> 02:01:41.055]  That's what it says it does.
[02:01:41.195 --> 02:01:48.519]  Or, oh, we're going to give the girls live cancer virus so they can't get this other cancer, but you'll still get the cancer.
[02:01:48.559 --> 02:01:50.520]  And, oh, by the way, it kills you as part of the time.
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:55.082]  And I mean, we're all being experimented on by a bunch of lunatics.
[02:01:56.383 --> 02:02:02.905]  And certainly they have no qualms about doing it to non-Caucasians.
[02:02:02.945 --> 02:02:05.766]  I mean, it's certainly clear that that's the main target.
[02:02:07.407 --> 02:02:15.429]  But they're also doing it to whites, and experimenting also, and Jews are doing it to Jews in Israel.
[02:02:15.469 --> 02:02:20.331]  I mean, it is just, it's a power trip by a bunch of sick freaks.
[02:02:20.993 --> 02:02:22.133]  I mean, how else do you say it?
[02:02:22.733 --> 02:02:26.134]  They have been obsessed with this all along as the ultimate weapon of warfare and control.
[02:02:26.734 --> 02:02:28.395]  And they're testing on us all right now.
[02:02:28.435 --> 02:02:30.215]  They're doing all sorts of things to us right now.
[02:02:30.235 --> 02:02:35.677]  And because it's so complex, you can't go down to the local cop detective and have him go bust them.
[02:02:36.677 --> 02:02:38.878]  We'll be right back with a lot of key news on the economy.
[02:02:38.978 --> 02:02:40.798]  Ron Paul, the 5th of November, stay with us.
[02:02:44.439 --> 02:02:45.839]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:47.920]  A new world order.
[02:02:48.667 --> 02:02:53.548]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:02:53.568 --> 02:02:55.288]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:02:56.388 --> 02:02:58.629]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:02:59.169 --> 02:03:01.629]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:02.349 --> 02:03:09.711]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:12.691 --> 02:03:17.652]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:18.152 --> 02:03:21.615]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:22.015 --> 02:03:24.537]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:03:24.577 --> 02:03:25.738]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:25.758 --> 02:03:26.498]  They're not after money.
[02:03:26.518 --> 02:03:27.599]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:27.799 --> 02:03:28.239]  They're after power.
[02:03:28.259 --> 02:03:29.801]  That's what they're after usually.
[02:03:29.941 --> 02:03:34.504]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:03:44.031 --> 02:03:45.973]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach!
[02:03:46.414 --> 02:03:46.694]  Look!
[02:03:47.094 --> 02:03:48.155]  Up there in the sky!
[02:03:48.576 --> 02:03:49.897]  It's Non-X-Man!
[02:03:50.277 --> 02:03:51.399]  He's in a dive!
[02:03:51.419 --> 02:03:53.721]  He must have got some ugly toenails on the beach!
[02:03:54.021 --> 02:03:54.782]  Let's go look!
[02:03:57.024 --> 02:04:00.207]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel!
[02:04:00.608 --> 02:04:01.969]  Stop hiding them in the sand!
[02:04:02.169 --> 02:04:02.610]  Take them out!
[02:04:03.237 --> 02:04:03.937]  Let's see.
[02:04:06.378 --> 02:04:08.499]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[02:04:08.860 --> 02:04:09.320]  Don't worry.
[02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:11.281]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:04:11.921 --> 02:04:16.343]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[02:04:16.863 --> 02:04:18.944]  Oh, I will Non-X Man.
[02:04:19.064 --> 02:04:21.765]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[02:04:23.886 --> 02:04:26.548]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[02:04:27.008 --> 02:04:30.509]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[02:04:31.010 --> 02:04:42.135]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.

[02:08:17.694 --> 02:08:23.378]  I want to tell you about a couple sponsors, and then we're going to get into the news on world's biggest bank in crisis.
[02:08:23.819 --> 02:08:25.200]  Ron Paul, 5th of November.

[02:08:39.983 --> 02:08:42.505]  Talk about the 5th of November and where Ron Paul's going from here.
[02:08:42.525 --> 02:08:43.506]  Just a quick interview there.

[02:09:26.407 --> 02:09:27.668]  It's too much to ever go over it all.
[02:09:27.728 --> 02:09:28.869]  It's really amazing stuff.
[02:09:29.630 --> 02:09:33.012]  LiveFreeNow.org LiveFreeNow.org or 760-868-4271.
[02:09:33.032 --> 02:09:33.052]  760-868.
[02:09:46.585 --> 02:09:58.469]  And then we have another wonderful sponsor to tell you about, and that is OutIn90.com.
[02:09:58.589 --> 02:10:00.750]  O-U-T-I-N-90.com.
[02:10:01.210 --> 02:10:04.451]  OutIn90.com, there's a banner up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:10:05.591 --> 02:10:10.113]  This is a book, debtor's secret weapon, and three jam-packed audio CDs.
[02:10:11.693 --> 02:10:14.574]  I was looking at one CD and it had like 60 something hours on it.
[02:10:14.594 --> 02:10:15.355]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:10:15.815 --> 02:10:18.136]  And it's just the basic stuff that really works.
[02:10:18.216 --> 02:10:23.118]  Get harassing creditors to stop badgering you with several proven techniques.

[02:10:43.054 --> 02:10:44.755]  Really important information in here.
[02:10:44.775 --> 02:10:44.815]  877-327-0365.
[02:10:44.835 --> 02:10:45.275]  877-327-0365.
[02:10:45.295 --> 02:10:46.516]  I got the book and the audio CDs.
[02:10:46.536 --> 02:10:47.296]  It's excellent info.
[02:10:47.316 --> 02:10:47.656]  877-327-0365 or out in 90.com.
[02:10:47.716 --> 02:10:50.998]  Now let me go ahead and get into the news here that we haven't gotten into yet.
[02:11:06.411 --> 02:11:16.616]  I told the story, I started getting into this at the beginning of the last hour, and I was listening to NPR Friday night, and they were saying, oh, no one knows why everybody's pulling out of bank stocks.
[02:11:16.656 --> 02:11:19.778]  That's just dumb general public who are uninformed.
[02:11:19.798 --> 02:11:21.199]  That was big money getting out of it.
[02:11:21.759 --> 02:11:23.360]  So I went and did some research that evening.
[02:11:24.349 --> 02:11:27.772]  And sure enough, I can tell by the snake-like tongue of these people, it was a fraud.
[02:11:28.253 --> 02:11:36.360]  And sure enough, what had gone on was all over the British, German, Dutch, Japanese, you name it, television and print news, financial news.
[02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:38.742]  World's biggest bank in crisis meeting.
[02:11:38.762 --> 02:11:39.743]  This is Friday evening.
[02:11:41.039 --> 02:11:54.328]  Here's a more turmoil-hitting Global Stock Markets group last night after it emerged that Citigroup, the world's biggest bank, they want to tell Americans this, had called an emergency board meeting for this weekend amid fears of escalating bad debts.
[02:11:54.729 --> 02:12:05.096]  Citigroup is seen as the bellwether for health on the financial system, but has been rocked in recent days over concerns that its exposure to America's subprime mortgage is a lot bigger than that.
[02:12:05.236 --> 02:12:06.377]  It's the inflation, folks.
[02:12:06.877 --> 02:12:07.818]  The economy's contracting.
[02:12:09.288 --> 02:12:10.789]  It's bigger than previously thought.
[02:12:11.210 --> 02:12:14.132]  News of the broad meeting came after U.S.
[02:12:14.152 --> 02:12:21.097]  stocks closed, so investors could not immediately react.
[02:12:21.217 --> 02:12:23.079]  Meanwhile, gold is at $810.50, an all-time insane high right now.
[02:12:23.099 --> 02:12:25.741]  An all-time bonkers high, racing upward.
[02:12:39.292 --> 02:12:41.713]  $810.50 right now.
[02:12:41.854 --> 02:12:45.795]  Bumping between $808.00 and $811.00 I guess now was the high.
[02:12:45.855 --> 02:12:47.016]  It's actually gone down 50 cents.
[02:12:49.457 --> 02:12:52.339]  And it's set to close in an hour and 45 minutes.
[02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:59.222]  See what it does in foreign trading after that at midnight over in Asia.
[02:13:01.403 --> 02:13:13.208]  The emergency at Citigroup follows the run on the British bank Northern Rock, which fell victim to global credit crunch in September, when the big central banks artificially restricted the issuance of credit and refused to buy corporate paper.
[02:13:13.508 --> 02:13:14.328]  That's your loans.
[02:13:15.248 --> 02:13:18.810]  Just over a week ago, the Bank of England warned that the crunch was far from over.
[02:13:19.190 --> 02:13:29.894]  Everything they can to accentuate, you know, is putting out... See, they put out news to investors and institutional investors, big money, that everything is curtains and absolute emergency.
[02:13:31.428 --> 02:13:35.809]  Then they tell the general public everything's wonderful and hunky-dory to keep you in there.
[02:13:36.910 --> 02:13:39.671]  Just over a week ago, the Bank of England warned that the crunch was far from over.
[02:13:39.971 --> 02:13:46.273]  Citigroup, which globally has more than a billion customers, has operated in the UK since 1902 and employs more than 12,000 people here.
[02:13:46.653 --> 02:13:52.635]  As well as banking in the UK, it also provides a range of commercial investment services to corporate financial investors and public sector clients.
[02:13:55.055 --> 02:13:59.277]  And it goes on to say that the head of Citigroup's leaving and another guy's coming in.
[02:14:01.613 --> 02:14:03.333]  Man, that is just incredible news.
[02:14:03.353 --> 02:14:13.996]  And there's all this other really bad financial news that is coming out all over the world.
[02:14:14.696 --> 02:14:20.217]  And I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this, but if you're talking to friends and family, it's easy to explain to them.
[02:14:23.158 --> 02:14:26.259]  The Federal Reserve says that we have below 2% inflation.
[02:14:29.682 --> 02:14:32.064]  Has milk gone up more than 2% in the last year?
[02:14:33.665 --> 02:14:35.486]  Have car prices gone up more than 2%?
[02:14:36.267 --> 02:14:40.950]  A car that was $30,000 this year, they're already announcing will be $45,000 to $50,000 next year.
[02:14:41.190 --> 02:14:41.691]  Same car.
[02:14:41.711 --> 02:14:45.113]  Oil has gone from 4 years ago
[02:14:48.326 --> 02:14:56.590]  At $40 a barrel, and that was supposedly high, to $96, $98, and they call it dropping back down to $94.
[02:14:56.710 --> 02:14:59.051]  It's just resting before it goes back up.
[02:14:59.791 --> 02:15:05.294]  Is oil going from $40 to $96 inflation?
[02:15:05.474 --> 02:15:06.254]  Just a question.
[02:15:07.155 --> 02:15:08.055]  Does it cost more?
[02:15:08.535 --> 02:15:09.556]  I don't know the answer to that.
[02:15:09.576 --> 02:15:11.637]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:15:14.972 --> 02:15:17.234]  Now, a lot of fools are saying, well, so what?
[02:15:17.254 --> 02:15:19.236]  If there's inflation, we won't feel it here.
[02:15:21.579 --> 02:15:22.179]  That's not true.
[02:15:22.239 --> 02:15:23.681]  You'll feel it here last.
[02:15:23.841 --> 02:15:27.084]  It's many times worse in Europe if you're there with dollars right now.
[02:15:27.585 --> 02:15:35.553]  But it is coming home, and as the people figure this out, there's going to be an even bigger rush to the door, dumping dollars.
[02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:38.801]  I mean, it's now cost Celeb to dump dollars.
[02:15:39.401 --> 02:15:42.201]  And remember, the Vice President dumped all his a year and a half ago.
[02:15:42.781 --> 02:15:46.682]  They've got all these movie stars and people in Europe saying, pay me in anything but dollars.
[02:15:47.122 --> 02:15:50.723]  Israel's demanding their 3 billion in goodies from us in euros.
[02:15:51.103 --> 02:15:52.924]  That's a nice little vote of confidence, Israel.
[02:15:52.944 --> 02:15:53.524]  Thank you.
[02:15:55.404 --> 02:15:56.585]  All of that is happening.
[02:15:57.025 --> 02:16:03.006]  Supermodel Bundichin joins hedge funds dumping dollars.
[02:16:04.176 --> 02:16:04.617]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:14.435 --> 02:16:27.966]  And Bill Goss, the Brazilian supermodel who Forbes Magazine says earns more than anyone in their industry, is at the top of a growing list of rich people who have concluded that the currency can only depreciate because Americans, as led by George W. Bush, are living beyond their means.
[02:16:28.266 --> 02:16:30.187]  There's also this statement that we're living beyond our means.
[02:16:30.548 --> 02:16:43.978]  No, we were the wealthiest country in the world, 4% of the world's population, with half the wealth 50 years ago, because we were the only country that had sound money, and just weights and measures, and hadn't had the central bankers fully take us over.
[02:16:44.258 --> 02:16:45.139]  Now they have!
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:53.023]  And yes, the bankers then got us extended out on all this debt to fully bankrupt us when they pull the rug out.
[02:16:56.205 --> 02:17:01.048]  But, I mean, there is a global push to sink us right now, and you're not going to hear it on your news.
[02:17:01.088 --> 02:17:02.729]  This is, of course, from foreign news.
[02:17:05.031 --> 02:17:06.211]  They're not going to let you know.
[02:17:06.231 --> 02:17:10.694]  They're going to tell you everything's fine.
[02:17:11.334 --> 02:17:19.062]  And I talked to full-grown adults, and I explained to them about the dollar, and they go, well, I'd get out of my stocks if I thought it was going to drop by 50%.
[02:17:20.003 --> 02:17:22.205]  And I'm like, it's dropped by 60-something percent!
[02:17:25.489 --> 02:17:29.473]  They just cannot, it is wanton blindness.
[02:17:29.993 --> 02:17:34.638]  I'm just telling you, my listeners, you better get positioned quickly.
[02:17:35.817 --> 02:17:36.458]  Bottom line.
[02:17:36.478 --> 02:17:40.705]  Alright, a bunch of other news in the next segment, then Jesse Benton from the Ron Paul 2008 dot com campaign.
[02:17:44.225 --> 02:17:48.146]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:17:48.366 --> 02:18:00.629]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:18:01.049 --> 02:18:01.449]  The U.S.
[02:18:01.489 --> 02:18:07.090]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:18:07.470 --> 02:18:09.691]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:18:11.551 --> 02:18:12.612]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:18:12.652 --> 02:18:15.493]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:18:15.613 --> 02:18:21.636]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:18:22.057 --> 02:18:25.418]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[02:18:40.129 --> 02:18:47.136]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:47.776 --> 02:18:57.325]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:18:58.402 --> 02:19:07.948]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:19:08.969 --> 02:19:14.453]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[02:19:51.481 --> 02:19:56.202]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:19:56.602 --> 02:19:59.243]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:19:59.723 --> 02:20:03.144]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:20:03.904 --> 02:20:08.225]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:20:08.665 --> 02:20:11.845]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:20:12.465 --> 02:20:15.286]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:20:16.087 --> 02:20:21.229]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.

[02:20:35.856 --> 02:20:40.277]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:20:40.658 --> 02:20:41.398]  Ask for George.
[02:20:43.914 --> 02:20:46.855]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:20:46.995 --> 02:20:52.176]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:20:52.536 --> 02:20:57.817]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:20:58.257 --> 02:20:59.378]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:59.718 --> 02:21:08.660]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:10.662]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.

[02:22:03.111 --> 02:22:10.035]  The way they've always done before.
[02:22:14.191 --> 02:22:20.518]  Just look at the hate we're breeding.
[02:22:20.578 --> 02:22:23.722]  Look at the fear we're feeding.
[02:22:23.782 --> 02:22:27.766]  Look at the lives we're leading.
[02:22:27.826 --> 02:22:30.970]  The way we've always done before.
[02:22:56.537 --> 02:23:05.899]  Ladies and gentlemen, over $2,100,000 has been raised today for Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:23:07.359 --> 02:23:10.040]  Big story up on Infowars.net.
[02:23:10.100 --> 02:23:12.620]  Ron Paul on course to raise millions in one day.
[02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:17.601]  November 5th, Money Bomb explodes into action.
[02:23:17.621 --> 02:23:19.502]  This is huge news.

[02:23:30.462 --> 02:23:34.965]  Get in there ladies and gentlemen and be part of history.
[02:23:35.305 --> 02:23:41.690]  We want to get out there on the field and give them a fight that they will never forget!
[02:23:45.713 --> 02:23:47.314]  So exciting what's happening right now.
[02:23:47.354 --> 02:23:52.979]  And former NFL star, latest to question, 9-11 official story, ex-Dallas Cowboys lineman,
[02:23:54.119 --> 02:23:57.060]  Stepanovsky tells Indiana Newspaper of doubts.
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:23:59.221]  Incredible information he brought forward.
[02:23:59.601 --> 02:24:02.023]  Paragraph after paragraph about it being an inside job.
[02:24:02.103 --> 02:24:04.644]  I can't wait to try to get him on the show.
[02:24:04.684 --> 02:24:06.865]  We're certainly working on that right now.
[02:24:07.956 --> 02:24:13.862]  CNN says price of Iraq war 10 times pre-war predictions.
[02:24:14.303 --> 02:24:25.854]  When President Bush's emergency supplemental funding request was granted by Congress in the coming weeks, the cost of the Iraq war will reach 10 times its original predicted cost of $60 billion, CNN reports.
[02:24:26.855 --> 02:24:31.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've already spent $1.2 trillion over there in the last four and a half years.
[02:24:32.179 --> 02:24:43.084]  And that doesn't count any of the pensions, or any of the health care, or any of it, or the ongoing, quote, diplomatic operation, the extermination op that's going on, the eugenics op, that's what it is, going on over there.
[02:24:44.965 --> 02:24:51.408]  Remember, the troops will be home by Christmas in six months, and the Pentagon documents said 100 years at least, never leaving!
[02:24:51.448 --> 02:24:58.151]  They said 100 year war, 50 years permanent bases, and they would lie to the public while having their official battle plan of 50 years.
[02:25:00.633 --> 02:25:01.473]  They know what they're doing!
[02:25:02.856 --> 02:25:06.180]  And now the public knows they've been lied to, and they want Ron Paul.
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:09.664]  They don't want that degenerate piece of trash Hillary Clinton.
[02:25:09.704 --> 02:25:11.706]  I mean, how you Democrats can still be for her?
[02:25:12.627 --> 02:25:13.047]  All of them.
[02:25:13.067 --> 02:25:16.591]  I mean, now that Fox News is behind her, and you claim you hate them so much?
[02:25:18.093 --> 02:25:19.514]  Ugh, it's just totally disgusting.
[02:25:19.534 --> 02:25:20.656]  Oh, and all the Democrats.
[02:25:20.696 --> 02:25:21.577]  They make me sick.
[02:25:22.313 --> 02:25:23.975]  Other than like a Gravel or somebody.
[02:25:24.355 --> 02:25:25.636]  And he is in for gun bans.
[02:25:25.656 --> 02:25:31.581]  I mean, Kucinich, people can all worship Kucinich all day, and I like him on a lot of issues, but comes out for handgun bans.
[02:25:31.621 --> 02:25:32.802]  I mean, come on, Kucinich.
[02:25:33.062 --> 02:25:34.544]  You know we have a tyrannical government.
[02:25:34.844 --> 02:25:36.605]  The last thing we need is things like that.
[02:25:39.988 --> 02:25:45.953]  And again, I just go back to Citigroup in big trouble, Merrill Lynch in big trouble, and this is all just the beginning.
[02:25:46.394 --> 02:25:48.035]  People say martial law couldn't happen here.
[02:25:48.055 --> 02:25:48.836]  Look at Pakistan.
[02:25:49.685 --> 02:25:55.126]  Musharraf warned, hold elections and quit as army chief.
[02:25:55.146 --> 02:25:57.967]  An envoy to spell out ultimatum in talks today in Pakistan.
[02:25:58.307 --> 02:26:07.028]  The US and Britain are today expected to demand that Pakistan's President, Presh Musharraf, honor pledges to hold elections in the next two months and step down.
[02:26:07.368 --> 02:26:12.649]  They're the ones that helped him have a coup in 99 and go to power.
[02:26:13.930 --> 02:26:15.070]  And then now the people after
[02:26:16.266 --> 02:26:24.519]  7 plus years and no it's a fraud and it isn't working anymore and so they're saying have a puppet election and Musharraf saying I'm not even going to have that.
[02:26:27.884 --> 02:26:29.126]  Isn't that just special?
[02:26:30.429 --> 02:26:34.350]  And now our governments are claiming that he's snubbing them, and oh, we're not with him.
[02:26:34.430 --> 02:26:35.850]  They're absolutely behind him.
[02:26:36.270 --> 02:26:43.552]  Musharraf snubbed Brown and Rice on emergency rule, that's Gordon Brown and Condoleezza Rice, Condoleezza Rice.
[02:26:44.052 --> 02:26:46.713]  Communications broke off after a pledge to hold election.
[02:26:47.073 --> 02:26:56.575]  President Peres Musharraf gave firm commitment to Gordon Brown and Condoleezza Rice that he would hold elections on schedule by January, just before imposing a state of emergency.
[02:26:57.643 --> 02:27:04.429]  It emerged yesterday, but hours later his government suggested they might renege on that pledge.
[02:27:04.609 --> 02:27:12.476]  And then there's not much discussion about how they've arrested tens of thousands of people, political activists, you name it.
[02:27:12.877 --> 02:27:16.700]  We're going to hear from the Ron Paul campaign about this historic 5th of November.
[02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:20.784]  I salute you all for your giving and just it's great to be
[02:27:21.767 --> 02:27:23.288]  To be with you here on the same team.
[02:27:23.348 --> 02:27:24.629]  All of us comrades in arms.
[02:27:24.669 --> 02:27:26.190]  Every man, woman, and child of us.
[02:27:26.631 --> 02:27:27.371]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:27.411 --> 02:27:28.592]  This is GCN.
[02:27:29.032 --> 02:27:30.613]  GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:34.156 --> 02:27:35.197]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.557 --> 02:27:37.158]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.079 --> 02:27:40.781]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.245 --> 02:27:52.029]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two books set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:27:52.410 --> 02:27:58.814]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:27:59.274 --> 02:28:09.180]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:28:09.681 --> 02:28:13.123]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:28:13.423 --> 02:28:16.105]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[02:28:16.745 --> 02:28:19.426]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.

[02:30:40.259 --> 02:30:42.341]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:30:42.461 --> 02:30:45.243]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:53.579 --> 02:30:57.821]  I've got a lot of other really powerful, important news we haven't gotten to yet.
[02:30:57.921 --> 02:31:04.565]  I'm only going to keep Jesse Benton, the spokesman for the Ron Paul campaign, the head of his media operations for about 10 minutes.
[02:31:04.585 --> 02:31:05.265]  He's very busy.
[02:31:05.285 --> 02:31:12.789]  Two and a half million dollars has been raised in the last 14 hours at ronpaul2008.com.
[02:31:15.211 --> 02:31:26.801]  They have raised as much money as they raised previously in the quarter in 14 hours, and the peak giving time kicks in at about 2 o'clock Eastern and runs until about 10 o'clock at night.
[02:31:26.921 --> 02:31:34.067]  So, we're talking about 8 hours, and until the end of the day we've got 10 hours, but we're talking about 8 hours of prime giving.
[02:31:34.187 --> 02:31:36.409]  Go to InfoWars.net.
[02:31:36.489 --> 02:31:40.332]  Get the article that succinctly explains the money bomb.
[02:31:41.056 --> 02:31:41.437]  OK.
[02:31:42.097 --> 02:31:43.138]  I'm giving again today.
[02:31:43.218 --> 02:31:45.160]  I'm sure the Neocons will attack.
[02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:47.162]  I'm going to get my whole family to give.
[02:31:47.202 --> 02:31:48.223]  They're giving again today.
[02:31:48.263 --> 02:31:49.764]  I've got to check, though, and see how much I've given.
[02:31:49.784 --> 02:31:50.785]  I may have already given my limit.
[02:31:50.865 --> 02:31:56.130]  I think that's... I mean, the point is that everybody needs to get in there and give, give, give, give, give.
[02:31:56.491 --> 02:31:57.752]  And I'm not going to be disparaged from...
[02:31:58.684 --> 02:32:00.024]  We're all Americans.
[02:32:00.044 --> 02:32:04.926]  We have a First Amendment right to give as we see fit.
[02:32:05.226 --> 02:32:06.486]  This is total First Amendment.
[02:32:07.126 --> 02:32:08.526]  And look, we're doing it!
[02:32:08.787 --> 02:32:11.227]  Two and a half million dollars.
[02:32:11.507 --> 02:32:13.268]  We could hit five million.
[02:32:13.308 --> 02:32:15.428]  In fact, fourteen hours have gone by.
[02:32:15.748 --> 02:32:16.929]  We have ten hours left.
[02:32:16.969 --> 02:32:18.329]  This is the peak giving time.
[02:32:18.909 --> 02:32:29.733]  Ladies and gentlemen, email, post on MySpace, tell everybody right now, and I think the article that Steve's done, Ron Paul on course to raise millions in one day, that's the best article to get that low.
[02:32:29.913 --> 02:32:33.735]  We're going to add a sub-headline there saying 2.5 million raised in 14 hours.
[02:32:35.015 --> 02:32:37.296]  Keep pushing, this is so exciting.
[02:32:37.656 --> 02:32:39.377]  Jesse Benton, I mean this is amazing.
[02:32:40.486 --> 02:33:03.139]  Absolutely is amazing, Alex, and you know, you and I have said together on your airwaves before that this campaign is going to be won on the backs of the grassroots supporters across the country, everyday Americans coming together in support of freedom, and this is just one more example of the amazing things that people are doing across the country to support Dr. Paul, support the Constitution, and support freedom.
[02:33:03.539 --> 02:33:10.064]  How are they going to claim that six guys picking their nose and eating Hot Pockets in a basement gave $2.5 million?
[02:33:10.464 --> 02:33:12.265]  Oh, well, there's just no way to refute it.
[02:33:13.466 --> 02:33:16.028]  I mean, there's just no way to refute that this grassroots support is real.
[02:33:16.048 --> 02:33:21.271]  I mean, people out there are putting their money where their mouth is, whether it's $10, $25, $50 at a time.
[02:33:21.291 --> 02:33:31.919]  You know, people across the country are coming together to donate and drive this money to the campaign, and there's absolutely no way that people can make those charges now.
[02:33:32.669 --> 02:33:35.150]  Break down the latest info on the graph.
[02:33:35.430 --> 02:33:40.413]  Give us, as you did off air, give us what you previously raised in the quarter versus the last 14 hours.
[02:33:40.793 --> 02:33:50.237]  Well, as of midnight last night, we had raised $2.77 million in quarter four, which is pretty substantial.
[02:33:50.817 --> 02:33:54.139]  But now we've just seen it just rocket off.
[02:33:55.538 --> 02:34:06.731]  As of right now, I'm looking at the ever-increasing, ever-growing numbers, and the ticker right now is at $5.135 million and growing every minute.
[02:34:07.111 --> 02:34:11.817]  We're raising... I was just on another radio station on XM Radio's POTUS-08, and...
[02:34:13.482 --> 02:34:14.803]  Well, it's also that Ron Paul
[02:34:35.194 --> 02:34:39.017]  When nobody was talking about it, explained the inflation tax, the plunging dollar.
[02:34:39.037 --> 02:34:43.942]  Now that's finally a major issue with Joe Sixpack and Sally Sockermom.
[02:34:44.342 --> 02:34:46.304]  We know they're about to launch the Iran War.
[02:34:46.764 --> 02:34:51.068]  We know that none of the other Republicans are worth a hill of beans compared to the Congressmen.
[02:34:51.088 --> 02:34:54.251]  They're pro-war, pro-open border, a bunch of them are pro-abortion.
[02:34:54.951 --> 02:35:03.381]  We know that Hillary is going to win if we don't get Ron Paul and so now he came in number three with the Evangelicals and Rising.
[02:35:04.282 --> 02:35:10.550]  We know now that with Alexa numbers and stat brain numbers that he is number 13,000 on the web.
[02:35:10.570 --> 02:35:11.090]  You have no idea.
[02:35:11.130 --> 02:35:12.432]  Prison Planet is 10,000 folks.
[02:35:12.472 --> 02:35:13.053]  It's mega huge.
[02:35:14.294 --> 02:35:17.516]  Hillary is 35,000 and dropping.
[02:35:17.556 --> 02:35:19.618]  Giuliani is 121,000.
[02:35:19.978 --> 02:35:24.441]  You can add up all the other Republican candidates and they're not even as big as Ron Paul on the web.
[02:35:24.721 --> 02:35:27.463]  He has hundreds of thousands of people in his meet-up groups.
[02:35:27.544 --> 02:35:28.844]  He is the phenomenon.
[02:35:29.145 --> 02:35:34.989]  But the pollsters only poll people who still got ground lines and who only watch TV.
[02:35:35.249 --> 02:35:36.630]  They are a minority.
[02:35:37.031 --> 02:35:38.332]  They are not the majority.
[02:35:38.432 --> 02:35:40.273]  Ron Paul is the candidate.
[02:35:40.313 --> 02:35:42.495]  The bookmakers are slashing his odds.
[02:35:44.817 --> 02:35:56.191]  Well, I think it's interesting that you bring up these bookmakers, because you're looking at people that run a multi-billion dollar global business based on very, very tight margins and very, very tight
[02:36:00.115 --> 02:36:00.676]  I agree with him.
[02:36:17.954 --> 02:36:19.235]  I agree with that, too.
[02:36:19.616 --> 02:36:21.137]  Look at how this campaign has grown.
[02:36:21.657 --> 02:36:28.923]  Back in the spring, we had a national campaign staff of 10, and we raised about $600,000 in the first quarter.
[02:36:28.943 --> 02:36:31.125]  We were operating out of a 600-square-foot office.
[02:36:31.165 --> 02:36:32.766]  Now we've got offices across the country.
[02:36:32.806 --> 02:36:34.808]  We've got a nationwide staff of 70.
[02:36:35.549 --> 02:36:40.433]  We keep quadrupling the amount of money that we raise.
[02:36:40.453 --> 02:36:42.675]  What's the total number raised right now?
[02:36:42.715 --> 02:36:43.275]  For this quarter?
[02:36:43.595 --> 02:36:45.477]  No, the entirety of the last three quarters.
[02:36:45.877 --> 02:36:47.278]  Ah, boy, over $10 million.
[02:36:47.839 --> 02:36:48.480]  Over $10 million.
[02:36:48.700 --> 02:36:51.782]  And today, it's $2.5 million and rising!
[02:36:51.802 --> 02:36:53.324]  $2.5 million, you're right.
[02:36:53.544 --> 02:36:55.065]  I mean, this is history, Jesse!
[02:36:55.326 --> 02:36:55.826]  It really is.
[02:36:56.226 --> 02:37:01.231]  And also, you know, Alex, you can't put a price tag on this grassroots support that is across the country.
[02:37:01.551 --> 02:37:09.700]  You know, we have 64,000 individuals signed up in Meetup groups that are coming together and spontaneously organizing to support Dr. Paul.
[02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:12.604]  And when I said hundreds of thousands, that's the 60 plus thousand in Meetup.
[02:37:13.024 --> 02:37:15.107]  There's tens of thousands of others in the MySpace.
[02:37:15.187 --> 02:37:16.108]  It's just explosive.
[02:37:16.588 --> 02:37:22.531]  Exactly, and they give the grassroots dynamic support that other campaigns are trying to buy, but they can't.
[02:37:23.231 --> 02:37:25.492]  We don't need $50 million or $70 million.
[02:37:26.832 --> 02:37:28.913]  We can do more with less.
[02:37:28.973 --> 02:37:32.675]  We still need the money, but we can do more with less because of this passion at grassroots.
[02:37:32.895 --> 02:37:38.277]  Well, there's no doubt the attack machine has gone into hyper-warp, so they're now seeing him as a real threat.
[02:37:38.877 --> 02:37:39.518]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:37:39.598 --> 02:37:39.898]  I will.
[02:37:40.318 --> 02:37:41.258]  Not to bring up
[02:37:43.183 --> 02:37:47.427]  On pleasant subjects, but we were being attacked for being associated with you.
[02:37:47.447 --> 02:37:53.011]  Supposedly, you were on our payroll, because you very generously over-contributed to the campaign.
[02:37:53.372 --> 02:37:59.036]  We refunded you some of your money, and you just turned up on our FEC report.
[02:37:59.217 --> 02:38:03.961]  Fox News and some other outlets were gnashing their teeth about Alex Jones on Ron Paul's payroll.
[02:38:04.021 --> 02:38:05.462]  Now, wait, wait, wait, just admit it.
[02:38:05.562 --> 02:38:06.403]  Alex is our friend.
[02:38:07.083 --> 02:38:18.810]  And, you know, you're just all ready to jump all over us because we have, you know, we appear on your program and talk to you like I think we should talk to everybody.
[02:38:19.270 --> 02:38:22.492]  And, you know, they were just all ready to attack us for you being on our payroll.
[02:38:22.512 --> 02:38:26.174]  They didn't even do their homework to see that it was a simple campaign refund.
[02:38:26.975 --> 02:38:28.115]  Actually, you're being kind there.
[02:38:28.156 --> 02:38:32.258]  We did discover that the first group knew it and saw in the filing that it was a refund.
[02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:34.500]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:38:34.900 --> 02:38:36.641]  So, you know, luckily there are still people out there.
[02:38:36.701 --> 02:38:38.201]  And you notice the thousand is right next to the 2300.
[02:38:38.461 --> 02:38:39.942]  That was the accident.
[02:38:40.562 --> 02:38:41.662]  Right.
[02:38:41.722 --> 02:38:45.683]  And people finally discovered they were all lying, but it shows how desperate they are.
[02:38:45.703 --> 02:38:48.944]  And now they're trying to make up all these other things, but it's not working.
[02:38:49.164 --> 02:38:51.005]  The people know who the liars are now.
[02:38:52.366 --> 02:38:58.370]  Well, I think that they just know that Ron Paul is the only truthful candidate out there.
[02:38:58.910 --> 02:39:03.634]  He's a man of just 100% upstanding integrity, and you can't smear him.
[02:39:03.674 --> 02:39:07.016]  So they're going to try to clutch at straws, and it's just not going to work.
[02:39:08.678 --> 02:39:09.918]  How did the Jay Leno thing go?
[02:39:09.958 --> 02:39:12.699]  Obviously, I saw it and it went great, but this is meteoric.
[02:39:13.199 --> 02:39:15.939]  I've got to tell you, Alex, it was really cool.
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:20.900]  It was just a first-class operation from top to bottom.
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:22.441]  Jay Leno is a really gracious guy.
[02:39:22.501 --> 02:39:27.682]  He came into the dressing room and sat down with Ron for about ten minutes and did a pre-interview.
[02:39:27.862 --> 02:39:29.782]  Jay was really interested in what Ron had to say.
[02:39:29.802 --> 02:39:33.943]  Another thing that's really cool, too, is that Tom Cruise came into the dressing room.
[02:39:35.643 --> 02:39:44.545]  He was talking, he knew exactly who Ron was, knew about his legislation and his leadership on these mandatory mental health screening bills.
[02:39:44.785 --> 02:39:50.307]  And I told Ron, go, go, go, thank you so much for what you do, and that was really cool, I gotta tell ya.
[02:39:50.947 --> 02:39:54.008]  This sounds like an exclusive, this is unknown, tell me more!
[02:39:54.728 --> 02:40:00.749]  Well, it's actually reported in Time Magazine, but... Okay, then that just must have just now come out.
[02:40:01.050 --> 02:40:01.570]  Right, it did, yeah.
[02:40:01.590 --> 02:40:02.710]  What else did Tom Cruise say?
[02:40:03.679 --> 02:40:10.043]  Oh, uh, you know, Tom Cruise is, uh, there, you know, he and, uh, he and some of the other, uh, some of the other folks that he, that he deals with.
[02:40:10.063 --> 02:40:13.185]  Yeah, you worry about the forced drugging, which this new Freedom thing would be.
[02:40:13.205 --> 02:40:14.406]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:40:14.486 --> 02:40:18.748]  And, uh, people out there, they, they realize that, uh, that Ron is the, is the leader.
[02:40:18.808 --> 02:40:20.309]  He's the leader on Capitol Hill.
[02:40:20.329 --> 02:40:23.271]  If you were in there, was there anything else said that wasn't in the Time Magazine?
[02:40:23.871 --> 02:40:24.552]  Oh, not particularly.
[02:40:24.592 --> 02:40:29.355]  No, it was just a friendly conversation, but it was just really, it was just really cool to see how people,
[02:40:30.135 --> 02:40:35.499]  I agree Jesse, but go back, because that is interesting.
[02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:42.144]  Specifically, it's in Times, there are reporters there, it isn't a secret, but tell us what happened in the conversation.
[02:40:43.966 --> 02:40:48.089]  You might find this a little humorous.
[02:40:48.149 --> 02:40:55.895]  After Tom had come in, and Ron was aware that he was a big movie star, but he kind of came over to me and put his hand on my shoulder and goes, what movie was he in?
[02:40:58.763 --> 02:40:59.303]  That's just kind of funny.
[02:40:59.323 --> 02:41:01.405]  He's got the biggest movie star on the planet.
[02:41:01.505 --> 02:41:04.947]  Probably somebody with just about universal household name recognition.
[02:41:05.267 --> 02:41:16.956]  He knows who Ron is and, you know, Ron is just so focused on freedom and on studying economics and, you know, leading America that he's not even quite sure who Tom Cruise is.
[02:41:17.036 --> 02:41:21.939]  I think that kind of talks to you about the dedication that Ron Paul has to America and has to freedom.
[02:41:22.020 --> 02:41:22.800]  So what did Tom say?
[02:41:22.820 --> 02:41:26.283]  He said, I really appreciate you fighting the new Freedom Force drugging initiative.
[02:41:27.618 --> 02:41:28.439]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:41:28.620 --> 02:41:31.964]  And that's just such a big issue to so many people.
[02:41:32.044 --> 02:41:33.686]  It's an issue that sneaks under the radar.
[02:41:33.706 --> 02:41:36.149]  Because I would imagine the time would span what Cruz said.
[02:41:36.169 --> 02:41:38.472]  Have you seen the article versus what was actually said?
[02:41:39.341 --> 02:41:42.682]  Yeah, it wasn't spun in any particular way.
[02:41:42.702 --> 02:41:46.544]  They just note that Tom was very gracious, very, very friendly.
[02:41:47.824 --> 02:42:02.730]  It's just really cool to see when someone of Tom Cruise's stature is recognizing Ron as being the leader on Capitol Hill and making sure that we don't have our elementary school kids forcibly doped up on Ritalin and Adderall.
[02:42:02.910 --> 02:42:09.334]  And then a big rock band, the Sex Pistols, said hey to Ron, and then Leonard did a radio interview saying they like Ron Paul.
[02:42:09.514 --> 02:42:14.578]  And the point here is, is that Tom Cruise, the rock and roll band, Jay Leno, they all like him.
[02:42:14.778 --> 02:42:15.538]  He could win!
[02:42:15.698 --> 02:42:17.139]  He could be the next president!
[02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:17.760]  Yeah!
[02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:20.622]  Freedom brings people together, Alex.
[02:42:21.082 --> 02:42:21.602]  Yeah!
[02:42:21.982 --> 02:42:24.204]  Freedom is a popular message, isn't it, my friend?
[02:42:24.224 --> 02:42:24.204]  100%.
[02:42:24.444 --> 02:42:24.864]  You know it.
[02:42:26.627 --> 02:42:30.712]  Well, I know we're going to be able to get the Congressman on this week or next week, and I really appreciate your help with that, Jesse.
[02:42:30.792 --> 02:42:33.655]  How is he holding up to this incredible schedule?
[02:42:33.956 --> 02:42:39.342]  Well, the campaign is really, really bending over backward to make sure that he gets his rest.
[02:42:40.323 --> 02:42:51.634]  He gets a day off every once in a while and then when we have a campaign day that we build a few hours of personal time for him so he can get his exercise, get on a bike, get time to walk, just get a little time away from everybody.
[02:42:51.794 --> 02:42:55.217]  He doesn't need to see my ugly mug 20 hours a day, that's for sure.
[02:42:55.978 --> 02:42:57.559]  But no, he's doing well.
[02:42:57.619 --> 02:43:03.945]  He's an incredibly fit man and he has an incredible amount of energy for anybody at any age, let alone somebody at 72.
[02:43:06.122 --> 02:43:11.064]  We're living history, Jesse, and you're right in the middle of it, like being with George Washington at Trenton.
[02:43:11.525 --> 02:43:20.849]  I mean, first, we have to understand we can beat the New World Order, with God's help, and then, two, we have to put it into action, and I want to salute my listeners.
[02:43:20.929 --> 02:43:27.432]  I remember Ron Paul coming on during the first quarter and saying, hey, it's the majority of the people I see at rallies, it's the majority of the people that are giving to us.
[02:43:27.772 --> 02:43:32.755]  Now, that's been eclipsed now, but literally, my listeners are some of the key seed folks
[02:43:33.275 --> 02:43:36.257]  I have to say, I'm so proud of them, Jesse.
[02:43:37.178 --> 02:43:38.139]  I agree, Alex.
[02:43:38.159 --> 02:43:48.506]  You know, there was a coalition of people across the country, and your listeners were a key part of that coalition, that you were right.
[02:43:48.686 --> 02:43:57.172]  There were seeds across the country, in all 50 states, that had heard of this, that knew this freedom message, and knew how important it was, and how powerful it was.
[02:43:57.672 --> 02:44:00.454]  Yeah, it was absolutely, absolutely key.
[02:44:00.534 --> 02:44:05.638]  This coalition that your listeners played such a key role in, in getting the message out there.
[02:44:05.738 --> 02:44:11.183]  And once the freedom message gets out there, it brings so many people together and really just is just so powerful.
[02:44:11.263 --> 02:44:12.764]  And you can just see how far it's spread.
[02:44:13.104 --> 02:44:22.330]  Well, I'm just incredibly honored that I've known Ron Paul for 15 years, that I've been interviewing him coming up with 13 years, and I'm just glad that we can share him with the world now.
[02:44:22.350 --> 02:44:24.851]  I'm so proud that he hails from right here in Texas.
[02:44:24.932 --> 02:44:26.352]  RonPaul2008.com or 1-800-RonPaul.
[02:44:26.372 --> 02:44:27.253]  I want everybody, even
[02:44:30.435 --> 02:44:34.757]  Even if you donated $50, $100 a month ago or earlier today, do it again.
[02:44:35.097 --> 02:44:35.878]  It's happening.
[02:44:36.058 --> 02:44:38.359]  Everybody, I'm not telling my office to donate.
[02:44:38.559 --> 02:44:40.560]  They're all back there donating right now.
[02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:42.881]  I'm calling family right when the show ends.
[02:44:42.941 --> 02:44:44.002]  I'm calling everybody.
[02:44:44.282 --> 02:44:45.443]  And I'm calling you on the air.
[02:44:45.483 --> 02:44:46.083]  But that's not enough.
[02:44:46.123 --> 02:44:52.086]  I'm making phone calls, telling people I know that I think they ought to give, because this is the 5th of November.
[02:44:52.146 --> 02:44:53.847]  Jesse Benton, God bless you.
[02:44:53.927 --> 02:44:54.687]  We salute you.
[02:44:54.927 --> 02:44:58.289]  And I want to get you back in the next few days on an update in the aftermath of this.
[02:44:58.669 --> 02:44:59.310]  I think of $2.5 million.
[02:45:00.769 --> 02:45:03.750]  And probably another 50,000 as we've been talking the last 15 minutes.
[02:45:04.270 --> 02:45:10.892]  I think that if we've already raised $2.5 million, I bet by the end of the day, what, it's $5 million?
[02:45:10.952 --> 02:45:12.053]  I think we're going to hit $5 million!
[02:45:12.813 --> 02:45:13.613]  That would be incredible.
[02:45:13.733 --> 02:45:19.995]  You know, every single dollar counts here, and what everybody else has to know, too, is there's a cumulative effect here.
[02:45:20.355 --> 02:45:24.737]  Every single additional dollar that we raise, every plateau that we can hit and surpass,
[02:45:25.217 --> 02:45:27.500]  We get that much more in earned media.
[02:45:29.061 --> 02:45:30.723]  We can raise four or five million dollars today.
[02:45:30.743 --> 02:45:35.968]  I'll bet we'll get four or five million dollars in additional earned media out of it because the press won't be able to ignore it.
[02:45:35.989 --> 02:45:37.070]  They're going to have to cover it.
[02:45:37.410 --> 02:45:41.254]  Well, this proves that he's not just grassroots internet, that he's grassroots.
[02:45:41.674 --> 02:45:42.255]  Absolutely.
[02:45:42.996 --> 02:45:46.620]  There are no spam bots out there contributing fifty bucks at a time.
[02:45:48.401 --> 02:45:54.144]  They are, and they're still saying he's got spam bobs and it's all made up, but I see Ron Paul signs from New York to Texas.
[02:45:54.964 --> 02:46:04.168]  They, I mean imagine, I don't, I've got to look at the Federal Election Commission numbers, but I don't think any candidate grassroots has ever raised five million dollars in one day.
[02:46:05.571 --> 02:46:13.557]  No, I believe that John Kerry raised something like that when he was running for the general back when he had the primary all locked up.
[02:46:13.957 --> 02:46:17.659]  But, you know, we've broken the record for a Republican online in one day.
[02:46:17.699 --> 02:46:22.623]  We've raised the most money online in one day for any candidate this cycle.
[02:46:23.083 --> 02:46:30.548]  And we're pushing, if we raise $3.1 million today, we'll raise more than any Republican has raised in one day online or offline.
[02:46:30.788 --> 02:46:31.608]  There's your headline.
[02:46:31.668 --> 02:46:33.709]  Ron Paul breaking every record.
[02:46:33.909 --> 02:46:35.950]  The ultimate dark horse to the rescue.
[02:46:36.310 --> 02:46:37.150]  I salute you.
[02:46:37.530 --> 02:46:38.771]  Thank you so much, Jesse Benton.
[02:46:39.051 --> 02:46:39.551]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:46:40.011 --> 02:46:41.492]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:41.712 --> 02:46:44.233]  The media man for ronpaul2008.com.
[02:46:44.253 --> 02:46:46.554]  A congressman with his monthly visit.
[02:46:46.794 --> 02:46:49.395]  Sometime this week or next week he'll be joining us for a couple segments.
[02:46:50.035 --> 02:46:51.656]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:46:51.756 --> 02:46:54.276]  We are living history here right now.
[02:46:55.757 --> 02:46:58.298]  And you can expose with the same grassroots action
[02:46:59.196 --> 02:47:00.998]  That AIDS is an engineered bioweapon.

[02:47:48.467 --> 02:47:49.387]  That's what I want.
[02:47:49.427 --> 02:47:50.588]  That's what I dream about.
[02:47:50.628 --> 02:47:51.868]  That's what I strive for.
[02:47:51.908 --> 02:47:54.990]  I know that's what burns in your heart out there as well.

[02:48:26.164 --> 02:48:31.147]  Final News Blitz in the final segment on the 5th of November.
[02:48:31.507 --> 02:48:34.709]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host, and retransmission starts in about 8 minutes.
[02:48:35.390 --> 02:48:37.211]  10 minutes right here at InfoWars.com.
[02:48:44.631 --> 02:48:46.031]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:46.051 --> 02:48:48.152]  A New World Order.
[02:48:48.872 --> 02:48:52.894]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:52.914 --> 02:48:55.515]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:48:56.595 --> 02:48:58.836]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[02:48:59.376 --> 02:49:01.837]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:02.557 --> 02:49:09.919]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:12.921 --> 02:49:17.904]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[02:49:24.789 --> 02:49:25.950]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:25.970 --> 02:49:26.710]  They're not after money.
[02:49:26.730 --> 02:49:27.811]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:28.031 --> 02:49:28.652]  They're after power.
[02:49:28.672 --> 02:49:29.852]  That's what they're after, isn't it?
[02:49:30.153 --> 02:49:34.716]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:49:45.304 --> 02:49:46.345]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:49:46.666 --> 02:49:49.449]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:49.729 --> 02:49:53.874]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:54.315 --> 02:49:55.156]  So what do you do?
[02:49:55.456 --> 02:50:00.022]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:50:00.502 --> 02:50:02.643]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:52:06.537 --> 02:52:10.919]  Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talking.
[02:52:11.039 --> 02:52:11.859]  I'll be gone.
[02:52:12.580 --> 02:52:14.301]  I'll be gone, like I said.
[02:52:17.167 --> 02:52:18.467]  I love you!
[02:52:18.587 --> 02:52:19.548]  The 5th of November!
[02:52:19.588 --> 02:52:22.108]  Understand your man, Hillary!
[02:52:22.168 --> 02:52:29.309]  We know you want to run your ops on women, make sure they're slaves, paying all their taxes into you.
[02:52:45.223 --> 02:52:51.751]  By the way, they're saying the Republican nomination is the most open in decades in the Washington Post.
[02:52:52.152 --> 02:52:53.453]  The last 30 years it is.
[02:52:53.534 --> 02:52:55.977]  Normally there's an heir apparent.
[02:52:57.112 --> 02:52:58.794]  And there's really no race at all.
[02:52:58.994 --> 02:53:02.938]  But since Hillary's so dominant, raised twice as much money as all the candidates combined.
[02:53:02.958 --> 02:53:05.161]  20 plus million dollars in one quarter.
[02:53:05.361 --> 02:53:09.826]  But that's all big defense contractor, big Republican money.
[02:53:10.066 --> 02:53:11.628]  The Republican money's going to her.
[02:53:11.848 --> 02:53:15.211]  Because she's made a deal with Fox and the neocons at least five years ago.
[02:53:15.532 --> 02:53:16.953]  Clinton was in business with Bush Sr.
[02:53:16.973 --> 02:53:17.514]  before that.
[02:53:17.554 --> 02:53:18.555]  That's now all come out.
[02:53:19.682 --> 02:53:21.743]  So I'm telling you, Democrats, you want more war?
[02:53:22.083 --> 02:53:27.885]  You want more destroyed economy, debased dollar, but a bunch of socialism they promise you that's just to take control of your lives?
[02:53:28.265 --> 02:53:29.345]  Go with Hillary Clinton.
[02:53:29.705 --> 02:53:30.986]  Only Ron Paul can beat her.
[02:53:31.246 --> 02:53:32.747]  See, he's probably going to raise $5 million.
[02:53:32.787 --> 02:53:37.308]  He's already raised over $2.5 million so far today and racing upwards.
[02:53:37.608 --> 02:53:38.168]  Historic.
[02:53:38.749 --> 02:53:45.351]  Yeah, she can get all the big defense contractors and big Republican money and big power plant owners and mainly people buying protection from her.
[02:53:46.629 --> 02:53:53.972]  Or you can go with the people's candidate, Ron Paul, who is raising the money in $10 and $20 and $100 donations.
[02:53:55.032 --> 02:53:55.792]  It's amazing.
[02:53:55.812 --> 02:53:58.573]  It's a Republican nomination, most open in decades.
[02:53:58.633 --> 02:53:59.374]  Another story here.
[02:53:59.454 --> 02:54:03.915]  Clinton broadly supports states' efforts to license illegals.
[02:54:04.375 --> 02:54:06.536]  CNN, it's got her quotes.
[02:54:06.616 --> 02:54:11.138]  She's for legalizing all the illegals by fiat at the state level.
[02:54:11.238 --> 02:54:13.498]  Total capitulation by the states.
[02:54:13.538 --> 02:54:15.159]  Homeland Security saying they accept it.
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:26.306]  And then in Europe it turned out, and in England they brought in unlimited numbers of illegal aliens, two-drive-down-the-wages, Federal Reserve Chairman saying, Bank of England Chairman saying, that's what they want.
[02:54:27.187 --> 02:54:28.868]  This is treason.
[02:54:29.408 --> 02:54:32.290]  And I'm asking you, Democrats, stop being idiots.
[02:54:33.531 --> 02:54:37.734]  Stop supporting Hillary and Obama, the pro-war New World Order candidates.
[02:54:38.074 --> 02:54:38.594]  Come on!
[02:54:39.575 --> 02:54:41.516]  And Republicans, stop being idiots.
[02:54:42.217 --> 02:54:46.580]  Do not support Giuliani and Mitt Romney and all this trash.
[02:54:48.115 --> 02:54:50.018]  Support Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:54:50.098 --> 02:54:50.859]  Come on!
[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:52.621]  Just look at him.
[02:54:52.641 --> 02:54:53.402]  Just listen to him.
[02:54:53.422 --> 02:54:54.423]  Just look at his record.
[02:54:54.784 --> 02:54:57.467]  He's got integrity, even if you don't agree with him on every issue.
[02:54:58.509 --> 02:54:59.410]  It's the 5th of November.
[02:54:59.470 --> 02:55:01.533]  I'm asking you to donate to RonPaul2008.com right now.
[02:55:03.786 --> 02:55:04.627]  Right now, folks.
[02:55:04.687 --> 02:55:09.571]  Get in there, and even if he doesn't win, even if they cheat with the machines, he's still giving them an incredible run.
[02:55:09.791 --> 02:55:21.661]  He'll have money to put ads on, to be there in the debates, the final debates, coming up the next two months, so they can't ignore him to inject big issues and embarrass the other people in the contest, the other candidates.
[02:55:23.482 --> 02:55:25.043]  Stop being just so mindless.
[02:55:25.104 --> 02:55:27.005]  Stop just going along with everything.
[02:55:27.045 --> 02:55:28.046]  I know my listeners aren't.
[02:55:29.537 --> 02:55:30.619]  I know you're taking action.
[02:55:30.659 --> 02:55:32.361]  Again, I'm just blessed to be associated with you.
[02:55:32.381 --> 02:55:41.374]  In the first hour, I got more into Ron Paul and the economy and this big Dallas Cowboy going public for 9-11 Truth, along with a lot of other key information.
[02:55:41.394 --> 02:55:44.779]  So if you missed any of the first hour, it restarts right now at InfoWars.com.

[02:56:11.288 --> 02:56:12.969]  I beg you to get it out to people.
[02:56:13.249 --> 02:56:15.631]  That is the goal to stop these murderers.
[02:56:15.931 --> 02:56:18.292]  If they get their global government, folks, it's all over.
[02:56:18.673 --> 02:56:20.654]  Nothing but God will be able to stand in their way.
[02:56:20.874 --> 02:56:21.975]  God bless you all!
