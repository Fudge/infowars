[00:00:05.746 --> 00:00:09.949]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.411]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.171 --> 00:00:13.072]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:17.656]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:21.999]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:55.115]  Well, she's starred in quite a few national television programs, TV shows, sitcoms, movies, has the number one show on Broadway, ongoing right now, Christina Ebersold, she's producing that.
[00:00:55.935 --> 00:00:59.916]  She's scheduled to be popping in with us in the third hour today.
[00:01:01.943 --> 00:01:07.406]  Earlier this year, she went public for 9-11 Truth and made international headlines.
[00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:14.669]  And as best I know, this is the first time she has gone public again for 9-11 Truth, coming up in the third hour today.
[00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:29.017]  And she's doing that because she's a speaker and going to be attending some of the events coming up this weekend in the next week for the sixth anniversary of the black-op government-sponsored terror attacks of 9-11.
[00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:33.021]  And that's our only guest today, coming up in two hours from now.
[00:01:36.303 --> 00:01:37.524]  We will have open phones.
[00:01:37.544 --> 00:01:39.005]  I'm going to attempt to control myself.
[00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:40.607]  You know, nine times out of ten I fail.
[00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:43.229]  But we'll try to go to your calls early in this hour.
[00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:45.651]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:48.093]  And first-time callers, go to the head of the line again today.
[00:01:48.113 --> 00:01:48.193]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:48.213 --> 00:01:51.416]  You agree with me, you disagree with me, you have a news item you want to discuss or a question you have, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:51.436 --> 00:01:52.717]  We do not screen the calls.
[00:02:05.874 --> 00:02:07.195]  We'd like to know what your first name is.
[00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:08.396]  You can make that up if you'd like.
[00:02:08.997 --> 00:02:11.138]  And just tell us where you're calling from.
[00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:13.140]  People like to always know that geographically.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.303]  It's interesting to picture it in their mind's eye where you're calling from.
[00:02:16.943 --> 00:02:22.588]  And if you'd like to volunteer that you disagree, go to the head of the line and even trump those that are first-time callers.
[00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:22.688]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:22.748 --> 00:02:28.252]  I premiered Endgame last night and I talked to about, I don't know, 60 or 70 of the 250 people that were there
[00:02:37.027 --> 00:02:41.509]  And they all said it was my best film, but they were very silent, very quiet.
[00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:48.912]  My father was shaken, because he knows I researched it all, and it was documented, and said it was very upsetting.
[00:02:50.473 --> 00:02:51.233]  Very upset.
[00:02:52.454 --> 00:02:53.894]  My mother was upset by it.
[00:02:53.994 --> 00:02:56.475]  My lawyer was there, a family friend.
[00:02:57.456 --> 00:02:58.496]  He was upset by it.
[00:02:58.516 --> 00:03:01.457]  I would like to hear from
[00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:07.664]  Listeners out there, in fact, you today will even trump people that disagree.
[00:03:07.684 --> 00:03:10.845]  Because then they don't have forever to hold.
[00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:13.085]  I want to get your reviews.
[00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:16.846]  When you call in, the phone's busy.
[00:03:16.886 --> 00:03:19.687]  As soon as we take a call, you can call in right when you hear I'm hanging up.
[00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:24.828]  I want to hear people's reviews.
[00:03:24.868 --> 00:03:27.009]  The good, the bad, the ugly of Endgame.
[00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.130]  And now, being able to have a large group of people,
[00:03:32.068 --> 00:03:34.049]  Pretty large group of people will be able to see it.
[00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:40.090]  Now I've got some more feedback and watching it on the big screen in that setting.
[00:03:40.591 --> 00:03:42.791]  I've got some comments about my new film.
[00:03:43.311 --> 00:03:45.472]  It will not be out, by the way, until mid-October.
[00:03:47.893 --> 00:04:01.017]  But that we will be showing tonight at the Alamo Draft House on South Lamar again, and then tomorrow night, and then I'm going to go to New York, and then on the 17th, we're going to show it one more time at the Alamo Draft House on South Lamar.
[00:04:01.764 --> 00:04:05.667]  A little snafu, like five, six days ago I noticed that it said all the tickets were sold out.
[00:04:07.308 --> 00:04:08.548]  I said, that's weird.
[00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.571]  So I called over there and they said, no, the tickets aren't sold out.
[00:04:12.591 --> 00:04:15.353]  And I said, but it says they're sold out online.
[00:04:15.393 --> 00:04:21.697]  They said, oh, we had the computer shopping cart ticketing system where it was only selling half the tickets.
[00:04:22.337 --> 00:04:23.338]  We do that sometimes.
[00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.500]  We'll set it to where you can sell 90% of the tickets.
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.522]  So there are a few tickets left, even this morning.
[00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:31.063]  I think it's like 15 tickets they were saying.
[00:04:32.325 --> 00:04:38.567]  Uh, for tonight's showing, so order them online right now, folks, at InfoWars.com.
[00:04:38.587 --> 00:04:41.328]  You can link through to the exact sub-page of the Alamo Draft House website.
[00:04:42.868 --> 00:04:45.109]  And, uh, there's some tickets left tomorrow night as well.
[00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:52.211]  And then, of course, they hold 25 tickets to the hour before, so you can also show up and do that.
[00:04:52.971 --> 00:04:55.131]  Alright, we're gonna come back into all the news.
[00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:57.232]  Stay with me, and it's a lot of important information.
[00:05:01.653 --> 00:05:02.413]  Terrorism!
[00:05:02.573 --> 00:05:03.314]  Terrorism!
[00:05:03.434 --> 00:05:09.495]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:05:09.735 --> 00:05:11.336]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:05:11.596 --> 00:05:14.057]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:05:14.457 --> 00:05:29.021]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:29.361]  government.
[00:05:29.541 --> 00:05:31.342]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:05:31.722 --> 00:05:37.644]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:05:37.764 --> 00:05:42.266]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.632]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:09.992 --> 00:06:17.637]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.334 --> 00:06:25.377]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.777 --> 00:06:37.222]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:41.004]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:43.445]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.745 --> 00:06:47.587]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:00.876 --> 00:07:03.819]  Where do you think one of the most toxic places on earth is?
[00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:05.361]  The answer may surprise you.
[00:07:05.521 --> 00:07:06.522]  It's in your body.
[00:07:06.762 --> 00:07:10.606]  The colon is a natural breeding ground for disease-producing germs.
[00:07:10.866 --> 00:07:15.010]  It may not sound like a very appealing subject, but it should not go ignored.
[00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:22.377]  For over a decade now, natural health expert Dr. Lauren Ritter has educated people everywhere about the benefits of internal cleansing.
[00:07:22.598 --> 00:07:24.860]  Now these benefits include higher energy levels,
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.362]  More comfortable digestion, high immune support, and healthier looking skin.
[00:07:29.683 --> 00:07:34.305]  Now you can try Dr. Ritter's Colon Cleansing Program from the privacy of your own home.

[00:07:48.473 --> 00:07:48.693]  Call now!
[00:08:05.882 --> 00:08:06.543]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.203 --> 00:08:08.264]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.964 --> 00:08:10.085]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.725 --> 00:08:11.566]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.306 --> 00:08:13.147]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.867 --> 00:08:17.510]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.153]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:44.127]  We are accelerating towards the 6th anniversary of the Black Op military-industrial complex coup against America.
[00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:54.736]  A coup that is failing despite their best efforts because the real patriots that are defending our constitutional republic are rising to the occasion to face the enemy.
[00:08:56.097 --> 00:08:58.939]  Very important story up on PrisonPlanet.com today.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.882]  Cheney Aide threatened terror
[00:09:02.722 --> 00:09:15.032]  To silence DOJ lawyer, Department of Justice lawyer, where one bomb away from getting rid of that obnoxious FISA court, cursed Addington.
[00:09:16.132 --> 00:09:32.385]  Dick Cheney's former legal counsel, David Addington, threatened the consequence of mass terror attacks in order to silence Department of Justice lawyer, Jack Goldsmith, when he questioned the legality of the warrantless wiretapping program, according to Goldsmith's new book.
[00:09:32.916 --> 00:09:45.781]  The Terror Presidency details how Bush administration officials dangled the fear of terror over critics' heads every time a whimper of dissent emerged over attempts to beef up executive power.
[00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:53.084]  David Addington is now Cheney's Chief of Staff and was once described by the U.S.
[00:09:53.124 --> 00:09:56.965]  News & World Report as the most powerful man you've never heard of.
[00:09:57.657 --> 00:10:09.127]  Immediately after 9-11, he published the argument that the NSA should be given carte blanche to wiretap purely domestic telephone calls and emails, a complete violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:10:10.748 --> 00:10:23.759]  When Goldsmith cautioned that the NSA eavesdropping program was a potential violation of the FISA Court shortly before controversy about the issue erupted into the media, Addington snorted
[00:10:25.456 --> 00:10:35.522]  And scorned him with a threat of a new 9-11 screeching, we're one bomb away from getting rid of that obnoxious FISA court.
[00:10:36.623 --> 00:10:39.084]  And the article continues from there.
[00:10:41.466 --> 00:10:53.713]  Likewise, when Goldsmith raised questions about another administration policy, Addington rebuked him with a vitriol stating, if you rule that way, the blood of a hundred thousand people
[00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.592]  Who die the next attack will be on your hands.
[00:10:59.093 --> 00:11:13.842]  Addington, who basically threatened the consequence of terror, if Goldsmith erected any roadblocks to stymie neocom political agenda, using the threat of terror to achieve a political objective, which is the very definition of terrorism.
[00:11:15.228 --> 00:11:19.672]  Well, we have the Republican memo two years ago that was then confirmed to be accurate.
[00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:21.333]  Later, people couldn't believe it.
[00:11:21.393 --> 00:11:43.170]  Now we've got Republican governors, Republican senators, former senators, heads of state parties, public memos, public articles in the newspaper saying 9-11 was wonderful, man, it really helped unify everybody to submit to our agenda of world hegemon, and we need to have an even bigger attack, and that will once and for all shut up all our critics.
[00:11:43.928 --> 00:11:49.293]  That's what I've heard Michael Weiner saying over and over again, Savage, as he poses as a conservative.
[00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:52.276]  He poses better than Moritz or Limbaugh or Hannity.
[00:11:52.496 --> 00:11:53.237]  Gotta hand him that.
[00:11:53.257 --> 00:12:01.084]  I mean, I agree with about 95% of what he says, but then he comes out with, uh, you just wait, you stinking liberal traitors.
[00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:04.187]  You just wait till there's another attack.
[00:12:04.948 --> 00:12:07.010]  And when there is, you're going in camps.
[00:12:07.873 --> 00:12:10.454]  And we're not going to pay for your food in the camps.
[00:12:10.474 --> 00:12:11.314]  You're going to have to work.
[00:12:11.334 --> 00:12:12.835]  There are going to be forced labor camps.
[00:12:12.895 --> 00:12:13.715]  You just watch.
[00:12:14.315 --> 00:12:19.937]  One more attack and it's going to be you that wouldn't let us take your freedoms to keep you safe.
[00:12:20.917 --> 00:12:22.337]  And it's going to be your fault.
[00:12:22.398 --> 00:12:25.518]  And you're with the terrorists when you're against the President.
[00:12:26.499 --> 00:12:28.139]  I mean, I heard him over and over again.
[00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:30.560]  Well, you know, he wrote a book about the case for internment camps.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.501]  So did Michelle Malcolm, the operative.
[00:12:34.701 --> 00:12:35.722]  This is who they are.
[00:12:35.782 --> 00:12:36.962]  This is how they operate.
[00:12:41.724 --> 00:12:43.765]  Just go to PrisonPlanet.com and get the story.
[00:12:44.386 --> 00:12:45.066]  Read the rest of it.
[00:12:45.106 --> 00:12:46.307]  Read all the hyperlinks.
[00:12:46.788 --> 00:12:55.234]  The definition of terrorism, according to Dictionary.com, is the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes.
[00:12:55.714 --> 00:12:58.516]  Another definition is a terroristic method of governing.
[00:12:59.056 --> 00:12:59.937]  Addington's rhetoric
[00:13:00.589 --> 00:13:03.391]  conforms to both these definitions.
[00:13:03.852 --> 00:13:15.380]  The fact that Addington used terroristic threats as a means of intimidating critics leads all the more intrigue to his comments that were made in the immediate aftermath of the 9-11 attack.
[00:13:16.221 --> 00:13:26.729]  Addington's first reaction to the collapse of the Twin Towers was that they must have been charged with explosives according to Dick Cheney's official biographer and biography.
[00:13:29.972 --> 00:13:32.433]  Here's the news I have in front of me today.
[00:13:32.453 --> 00:13:37.174]  APEC Pro Bush Group granted permit.
[00:13:37.474 --> 00:13:49.458]  They're having a big Asian Pacific Union meeting over there in Australia and about half the city's been cordoned off and shut down, the entire business district.
[00:13:53.339 --> 00:13:58.441]  And then on top of that, they are banning any protest anywhere in the city.
[00:13:59.685 --> 00:14:03.506]  We have the video clips, the newscast, where they're announcing it with straight faces.
[00:14:04.786 --> 00:14:13.168]  You can just type APEC protest banned into Google and you'll get a bunch of mainstream news stories or permits to demonstrate refused.
[00:14:13.548 --> 00:14:14.128]  Things like that.
[00:14:14.148 --> 00:14:15.348]  I mean, there's literally hundreds of them.
[00:14:15.368 --> 00:14:17.109]  I probably read 20 or 30 the last day.
[00:14:18.569 --> 00:14:29.331]  But the issue here is that pro-Bush, pro-New World Order, pro-war, pro-open borders, because they're pushing that same agenda in Australia right now,
[00:14:31.443 --> 00:14:35.984]  Groups are allowed and have been issued permits.
[00:14:36.784 --> 00:14:44.866]  Now, if that isn't tyranny, in Russia today and during the Soviet era, almost everything we do in this country now was adopted from them.
[00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.106]  They didn't invent something new.
[00:14:47.146 --> 00:14:52.187]  They had protest zones in Russia 30 years ago.
[00:14:54.088 --> 00:15:00.429]  They had hate speech and hate crimes laws 50 plus years ago developed and employed in Russia.
[00:15:01.596 --> 00:15:07.620]  The term political correctness has been around for seventy-five years in Russia.
[00:15:08.321 --> 00:15:15.405]  During the heart of the Bolshevik purges they were engaging in the term political correctness.
[00:15:15.725 --> 00:15:16.826]  You are not politically correct.
[00:15:16.846 --> 00:15:20.509]  You're sentenced to ten years forced labor in gulags.
[00:15:24.271 --> 00:15:25.112]  In the gulag.
[00:15:26.012 --> 00:15:28.654]  Read Gulag Archipelago by Alexander Shultz and Edson.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.002]  When he first published it, you know, he won the Nobel Prize.
[00:15:32.062 --> 00:15:33.202]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:15:34.663 --> 00:15:39.186]  But then the Soviet documents were all released and it was worse than Solzhenitsyn said.
[00:15:39.206 --> 00:15:43.829]  If you haven't read the Gulag Archipelago, you know, I'm going to carry that.
[00:15:43.849 --> 00:15:44.910]  I'm going to find the publisher.
[00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:46.811]  I've read it like three times over the years.
[00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:52.034]  And I'm going to find a good paperback version of that that we can get inexpensively to put out.
[00:15:52.595 --> 00:15:54.196]  And we're going to carry Gulag Archipelago in 1984.
[00:15:54.836 --> 00:15:56.137]  I don't know why we haven't gotten around to that.
[00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.170]  Because that's the real deal.
[00:16:03.411 --> 00:16:06.232]  I mean, he was a Soviet, folks, and he wrote some stuff.
[00:16:06.252 --> 00:16:06.792]  They didn't like him.
[00:16:06.832 --> 00:16:11.253]  They said, how'd you like to spend ten years in forced labor, Bubba, up at the Arctic Circle?
[00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:16.634]  How's that sound?
[00:16:17.134 --> 00:16:18.574]  But I'm already digressing here.
[00:16:20.475 --> 00:16:26.936]  In Seattle, the federal government staged riots, which admittedly, local news admitted, that the government literally staged.
[00:16:29.099 --> 00:16:37.704]  Then they set the precedent and issued the federal gear and training, not just in the U.S., but in Germany, England, Japan, China adopted the same policies.
[00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:39.225]  It's all under U.N.
[00:16:39.285 --> 00:16:39.885]  regulations.
[00:16:39.945 --> 00:16:41.086]  It's all under the different agendas.
[00:16:41.106 --> 00:16:42.587]  It's all globally codified.
[00:16:43.387 --> 00:16:44.327]  Global standards.
[00:16:45.808 --> 00:16:55.994]  It's just like last week, the International Tribunal of the World Trade Organization, unelected private group, announced we've got to let Mexican trucks in, and they're now on the streets today.
[00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:57.965]  In fact, today was the day.
[00:16:58.485 --> 00:17:01.008]  First they said Saturday, then they said Monday, now today they're rolling.
[00:17:01.028 --> 00:17:01.568]  It's in the news.
[00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:08.654]  And they just said, we don't care what your courts say, we don't care what your state laws say, we don't care.
[00:17:09.274 --> 00:17:10.395]  Look, it's a done deal.
[00:17:13.077 --> 00:17:15.920]  See, that's global government right there, but I'm digressing.
[00:17:19.242 --> 00:17:26.228]  And so over in Australia, they're telling liberal, conservative, libertarian, mainline groups, I mean, APEC is very
[00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:28.317]  Unpopular.
[00:17:28.417 --> 00:17:29.958]  Just like NAFTA and GAD are here.
[00:17:29.998 --> 00:17:31.998]  Just like all these organizations are.
[00:17:33.339 --> 00:17:41.021]  These liberty-robbing, sovereignty-destroying instruments, mechanisms, bodies, conglomerates, combines, whatever you want to call them.
[00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:45.362]  Whatever the case may be, with the different configurations of them, it's the same thing.
[00:17:45.582 --> 00:17:46.163]  Same creature.
[00:17:47.543 --> 00:17:49.944]  Extra-governmental organizations with governmental power.
[00:17:50.804 --> 00:17:54.325]  And the power to levy tax and seize property and asset forfeiture.
[00:18:01.405 --> 00:18:09.107]  And so here I am looking at ABC News out of Australia, just reporting, oh, the pro-Bush group, it gets to demonstrate.
[00:18:12.367 --> 00:18:19.429]  You see, first they say, oh, you can only protest in free speech zones, and then they say, you know what, we're not even issuing those permits.
[00:18:20.209 --> 00:18:22.670]  But we're going to let pro-government people demonstrate.
[00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.710]  I mean, that's how it is in Russia.
[00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:29.251]  There's all these state-sponsored and state-approved demonstrations, Youth League,
[00:18:30.557 --> 00:18:34.878]  Uh, events that go on in Russia every single day in Moscow and in Red Square.
[00:18:36.038 --> 00:18:36.698]  I mean, every day.
[00:18:36.718 --> 00:18:39.839]  It's like the mall in D.C.
[00:18:42.019 --> 00:18:54.162]  But any other group, it could be communists, it could be conservatives, it could be nationalists, you go out there, the cops come right up with German Shepherds and they bite you and they beat you on the head with clubs and they take you to prison.
[00:18:56.782 --> 00:18:59.243]  Well, it's the exact same thing in New York City.
[00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:02.170]  It's the exact same thing in Dallas, Texas.
[00:19:02.811 --> 00:19:05.232]  It's the exact same thing in Los Angeles, California.
[00:19:05.513 --> 00:19:07.894]  I mean the exact same thing.
[00:19:08.995 --> 00:19:11.016]  Now that's not Land of the Free, Home of the Brave.
[00:19:11.657 --> 00:19:15.019]  And how many of these cops know free speech shows come right out of Soviet Russia?
[00:19:15.658 --> 00:19:17.819]  How many of them know the term political correctness comes out of there?
[00:19:18.039 --> 00:19:26.141]  How many of them know that our government hired Prima Copp, the former head of the KGB, five years ago to consult Homeland Security before it even got funding?
[00:19:26.381 --> 00:19:30.802]  How many of them know that four years ago they hired Marcus Wolf, the former head of the East German Stasi?
[00:19:31.082 --> 00:19:32.643]  When I heard that, by the way, I didn't believe it.
[00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:36.004]  I went and did research and found out and found the Congressional Payment Orders.
[00:19:37.984 --> 00:19:39.045]  It's paid over a million dollars.
[00:19:40.845 --> 00:19:42.166]  You know who the Stasi are, folks?
[00:19:42.206 --> 00:19:43.146]  You better learn!
[00:19:44.008 --> 00:19:45.690]  Because they're setting that up here.
[00:19:47.112 --> 00:19:49.014]  And you better think about what Sheldon Eason said.
[00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:51.496]  About, oh how we burned in the camps.
[00:19:52.177 --> 00:19:53.639]  Wishing we'd have done something about it.
[00:19:54.379 --> 00:19:55.621]  They make their move here.
[00:19:56.622 --> 00:19:59.205]  We have a duty-bound right to resist.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:14.532]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:20:14.752 --> 00:20:18.236]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[00:20:18.516 --> 00:20:22.723]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:20:23.003 --> 00:20:26.949]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:33.680]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:39.401]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:20:39.641 --> 00:20:46.562]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system, so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[00:20:46.622 --> 00:20:48.603]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[00:20:48.643 --> 00:20:49.223]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[00:20:49.243 --> 00:20:49.523]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:20:49.543 --> 00:20:51.263]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:20:51.303 --> 00:20:52.243]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:06.063]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:21:06.103 --> 00:21:07.344]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:21:07.525 --> 00:21:11.088]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:21:11.389 --> 00:21:13.911]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:21:14.312 --> 00:21:16.053]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:21:16.374 --> 00:21:18.536]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:21:19.737 --> 00:21:25.440]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.841]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:21:27.921 --> 00:21:29.342]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:47.131]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:22:03.729 --> 00:22:04.489]  Thanks for watching!
[00:22:22.472 --> 00:22:27.956]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:01.972 --> 00:23:04.433]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:05.133 --> 00:23:08.774]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:23:09.414 --> 00:23:13.295]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:23:13.995 --> 00:23:22.558]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:30.729]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:39.772]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:40.872 --> 00:23:43.433]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:49.759 --> 00:23:50.179]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:50.460]  Call now.
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.602]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:23:53.622 --> 00:23:54.503]  Is it getting better?
[00:24:17.743 --> 00:24:22.284]  Or do you feel the same?
[00:24:23.064 --> 00:24:25.465]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[00:24:25.665 --> 00:24:45.249]  You've got someone to blame You said one love, one life When it's one need in the night One love, we get to share it
[00:24:47.095 --> 00:24:51.757]  It leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it.
[00:24:51.998 --> 00:24:59.541]  Did I disappoint you?
[00:24:59.681 --> 00:25:08.746]  Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
[00:25:13.664 --> 00:25:39.970]  You act like you never had love And you want me to go without Well it's too late tonight To drag the past out into the light We're one but we're not the same We get to carry each other
[00:25:41.664 --> 00:25:49.329]  Coming up, United Nations American economy growth will fall behind the rest of the world in 2007.
[00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:52.311]  Their plan going according to plan.
[00:25:53.332 --> 00:25:53.692]  More.
[00:25:53.712 --> 00:26:08.722]  For the first time since 2001, both the EU and Japan are predicted to have higher GDP growth than the USA will be reported this afternoon in the United Nations report.
[00:26:10.089 --> 00:26:12.271]  And that's only the beginning if they have their way.
[00:26:12.311 --> 00:26:21.579]  I've heard them actually brag on NPR three years ago how they were going to destroy the economy and give us a horrible standard of living, but how it was for the Earth!
[00:26:21.979 --> 00:26:23.620]  Oh, it's so good what they're doing.
[00:26:25.242 --> 00:26:31.787]  Yes, some nukes on a B-52 getting flown up to North Dakota where they disposed of them.
[00:26:31.827 --> 00:26:33.288]  They didn't take them off the plane.
[00:26:34.449 --> 00:26:38.833]  And then they flew it back to another state, and there's a bunch of hysteria and freak-outs over this.
[00:26:40.434 --> 00:26:58.189]  Folks, if you're worried about that, you really ought to worry about all the genetic engineering that's going on, how they're accelerating the neutrinos and things in the superconducting supercolliders that the mainline equations show could have cataclysmic chain reaction effects.
[00:26:58.209 --> 00:26:59.750]  You've seen a hydrogen bomb go off?
[00:27:00.491 --> 00:27:06.376]  That's like a BB gun compared to the largest howitzer in scale.
[00:27:09.464 --> 00:27:12.646]  And so I mean I've got all that in front of me too.
[00:27:12.686 --> 00:27:14.326]  I mean we're just wallowing in news here.
[00:27:14.867 --> 00:27:15.907]  We covered this Friday.
[00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:17.168]  We covered this Sunday.
[00:27:17.628 --> 00:27:19.329]  More has come out on it now.
[00:27:19.889 --> 00:27:21.870]  I want to get into this later after we take some calls.
[00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:25.512]  Bush greases skids for UN pandemic power grab.
[00:27:27.993 --> 00:27:32.815]  And I have read the now declassified SPP, North American Plan as it's called.
[00:27:35.073 --> 00:27:38.596]  And it says, Weber, that the Congress doesn't have any authority.
[00:27:38.976 --> 00:27:48.183]  Remember Bush, with PDD 51, said in May 9th, it's on the whitehouse.gov, that Congress isn't involved in continuity of government.
[00:27:49.204 --> 00:27:51.145]  That was high treason right there and unprecedented.
[00:27:51.185 --> 00:28:01.213]  And now he says, not only is Congress not involved, the United Nations will coordinate the North American response, the CDC, NORTHCOM,
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:08.367]  And a whole gaggle of other federal agencies, through Homeland Security, will take direct orders from the United Nations.
[00:28:08.387 --> 00:28:23.162]  See, it all starts with Russian inspectors at our nuke plants, and Russian inspectors on the B-52s and B-1s and B-2s, and then it starts with inspectors at NORAD and UN inspectors, and see, it's all going under international control.
[00:28:24.617 --> 00:28:33.138]  The global corporations have set up a global court, global army, global tax, and all the nations are going under its regulatory control, including ours.
[00:28:33.999 --> 00:28:35.439]  Just like England's going under it.
[00:28:35.899 --> 00:28:40.980]  And the people don't like it, so the media just keeps it simple and says, none of it's happening, go back to sleep.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.641]  They talk to you like you're a five-year-old child.
[00:28:49.081 --> 00:28:53.842]  That's exactly how they talk to people on the news and in the general newspaper.
[00:28:57.774 --> 00:29:06.100]  And the sick part is all these bureaucrats and all the people in the technocracy and the cops and the military and the bureaucrats, you're cutting off your own nose to spite your face.
[00:29:07.021 --> 00:29:15.387]  Enjoy your little power trip today because you are destroying the best country there ever was and where you live!
[00:29:17.388 --> 00:29:20.070]  Soiling your own nest and laughing while you do it.
[00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:28.753]  Really nice police officer came up with his girlfriend or wife last night at the event.
[00:29:28.773 --> 00:29:30.334]  Said, hey, all cops aren't bad, Alex.
[00:29:31.315 --> 00:29:32.636]  Really nice, you know, fella.
[00:29:34.297 --> 00:29:35.158]  San Antonio cop.
[00:29:35.198 --> 00:29:36.899]  And I said, look, I know all police aren't bad.
[00:29:36.939 --> 00:29:38.200]  I'm not saying that.
[00:29:39.121 --> 00:29:40.282]  I just... the system's bad.
[00:29:42.144 --> 00:29:43.965]  I'm gonna tell some stories about Endgame last night.
[00:29:43.985 --> 00:29:44.646]  It was amazing.
[00:29:45.546 --> 00:29:49.149]  And, uh... We're gonna get into this Apex situation.
[00:29:49.169 --> 00:29:50.590]  We'll take your calls, though, when we get back.
[00:29:51.911 --> 00:29:52.792]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.293 --> 00:29:54.794]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.786 --> 00:29:58.567]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.629 --> 00:30:03.590]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.891]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:30:07.171 --> 00:30:11.953]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:30:12.253 --> 00:30:14.995]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:30:15.255 --> 00:30:19.917]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[00:30:20.217 --> 00:30:22.098]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:30:22.578 --> 00:30:32.523]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[00:30:32.903 --> 00:30:37.545]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:30:37.965 --> 00:30:41.488]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[00:30:41.708 --> 00:30:43.870]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:48.294]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll even refund the shipping charge.
[00:30:48.614 --> 00:30:51.736]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[00:30:51.937 --> 00:30:52.837]  What are you waiting for?
[00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:53.698]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[00:30:53.718 --> 00:30:54.098]  That's 1-888-873-7371.
[00:30:54.158 --> 00:30:54.319]  Today!
[00:31:01.886 --> 00:31:03.727]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:31:03.867 --> 00:31:09.048]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:31:09.229 --> 00:31:10.569]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:31:10.829 --> 00:31:18.992]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:31:19.232 --> 00:31:24.954]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:31:25.134 --> 00:31:26.915]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:31:26.976 --> 00:31:29.117]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:31:29.277 --> 00:31:33.541]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:31:33.701 --> 00:31:35.823]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:31:35.903 --> 00:31:43.669]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:45.300]  Attention!
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.941]  This is an urgent GCN News Bulletin!
[00:31:47.061 --> 00:31:50.583]  Honeybees are now mysteriously vanishing at an astonishing pace across the entire country.
[00:31:50.663 --> 00:31:53.164]  Why is this urgent message about honeybees so desperately important?
[00:32:11.613 --> 00:32:12.554]  The answer is easy.
[00:32:12.694 --> 00:32:18.917]  You see, honeybees produce a unique compound, fed only to the queen, that makes her live six times longer than other bees in the hive.
[00:32:19.117 --> 00:32:23.180]  Some researchers now believe the compound may have miraculous effects on humans as well.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:29.323]  The compound is called Royal Jelly, and is now available in an all-new, ultra-purified form called Gelosene Gold.
[00:32:29.483 --> 00:32:34.886]  The product has been designed for purity-conscious Americans who are concerned about contaminated royal jelly entering the U.S.
[00:32:34.926 --> 00:32:35.406]  from Asia.
[00:32:35.587 --> 00:32:39.909]  Solutions from Science is the only company authorized to sell Gelosene Gold in the U.S.
[00:32:40.169 --> 00:32:40.729]  We're good to go.
[00:33:11.886 --> 00:33:15.447]  We're showing Endgame tonight at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:33:15.467 --> 00:33:16.427]  It's almost sold out.
[00:33:16.447 --> 00:33:23.849]  You can still get tickets at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and they hold back some tickets to the hour before.
[00:33:27.409 --> 00:33:28.529]  The show starts at 7.
[00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:32.570]  I'll be giving a speech and taking questions and comments after.
[00:33:34.111 --> 00:33:40.312]  That is coming up tonight, and then one more showing tomorrow night, and then the 17th of this month, one more showing yet again.
[00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:45.911]  Because there's a big demand.
[00:33:48.131 --> 00:33:52.032]  Alright, Samuel, Charles, John, Blake, Roman, we're going to get to you here in just a moment.
[00:33:52.052 --> 00:33:53.772]  Let me just finish the thought on the police state.
[00:33:55.412 --> 00:34:03.334]  So first, the federal government comes out, issues the federal Darth Vader outfits, literal Darth Vader outfits to the police.
[00:34:03.634 --> 00:34:06.194]  They stage riots, that part is documented and admitted.
[00:34:07.455 --> 00:34:09.615]  Then they issue training manuals globally.
[00:34:12.222 --> 00:34:22.251]  It is adopted, and then they just announced the Soviet system of free speech zones, and permitted marches, and then they just stopped issuing the permits!
[00:34:23.171 --> 00:34:35.642]  And in Australia, which just 20 years ago was one of the freest places in the world, great people, it's a lot like Texas, the culture's been, my sociologist likened to,
[00:34:37.064 --> 00:34:38.585]  They've banned almost all guns.
[00:34:38.645 --> 00:34:40.906]  They're overrun with foreigners, illegal aliens.
[00:34:41.287 --> 00:34:42.407]  It's a total police state.
[00:34:42.427 --> 00:34:43.688]  You're arrested for your speech.
[00:34:44.128 --> 00:34:47.150]  They've banned protests now for five years, off and on.
[00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:51.012]  And they say there's no protesting allowed anywhere in the city.
[00:34:51.332 --> 00:34:52.253]  We just say so.
[00:34:52.313 --> 00:34:53.274]  We're not issuing permits.
[00:34:53.294 --> 00:34:55.275]  See, first they say there's a permit, which you really don't need.
[00:34:55.295 --> 00:34:56.656]  Then they say, okay, no permit.
[00:34:56.676 --> 00:34:57.276]  See how that works?
[00:34:57.736 --> 00:34:59.097]  Kind of like New York 30 years ago.
[00:34:59.377 --> 00:35:01.198]  Gotta have a gun permit to own a gun.
[00:35:01.358 --> 00:35:02.639]  Oh, we don't issue permits anymore.
[00:35:03.257 --> 00:35:10.760]  And then literally there was articles where you gotta give like $30,000 to the campaign of the sheriff and only mobsters can carry guns because they got the cash.
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.580]  I mean, this is corruption.
[00:35:16.301 --> 00:35:19.823]  A permit is a license to do something that would be illegal.
[00:35:19.843 --> 00:35:23.524]  Hey, listen, I don't need a license to drive.
[00:35:23.544 --> 00:35:24.764]  I don't need a license to get married.
[00:35:24.784 --> 00:35:28.766]  I don't need a li... I mean, you may think I do because somebody told you so, but you're wrong.
[00:35:28.906 --> 00:35:29.806]  I've actually studied it.
[00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:35.652]  Now that doesn't mean you don't have overwhelming force and can't make me.
[00:35:36.433 --> 00:35:38.154]  But the point is, is that it's a fraud.
[00:35:39.635 --> 00:35:44.458]  And so ABC News over in Australia reports APEC, pro-Bush group, granted permit.
[00:35:45.959 --> 00:36:02.391]  The biggest security operation in Australian history will slip into top gear, and it goes into President Bush touching down in Sydney after being in Iraq, and it goes in to say that a local pro-APEC, pro-war, pro-Bush group, you can go read about it on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:03.743 --> 00:36:04.563]  He's allowed to protest.
[00:36:05.364 --> 00:36:09.426]  Meanwhile, here's the article Paul Watson wrote yesterday, protesting Bush outlawed at APEC.
[00:36:09.866 --> 00:36:18.850]  Authorities turned Sydney into a prison camp and refused permission for main organizations to march, characterizing protest as an unlawful act.
[00:36:19.491 --> 00:36:26.034]  And so the mainline political groups in Australia say they're going to march anyways today, and that's ongoing right now.
[00:36:27.941 --> 00:36:30.263]  So we should know in the next few hours what's going to happen there.
[00:36:30.463 --> 00:36:35.347]  Paul Watson's watching it diligently over at Prison Planet, so is Steve Watson at Infowars.net.
[00:36:36.668 --> 00:36:40.111]  Sydney will descend into chaos as top riot cop.
[00:36:41.292 --> 00:36:50.399]  And we've seen a provocateur in Australia, we've seen a provocateur in Canada, we've seen a provocateur in Germany, we've seen a provocateur in England, Russia, France,
[00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:52.497]  The United States?
[00:36:52.677 --> 00:36:53.618]  I mean on video!
[00:36:53.919 --> 00:37:01.367]  The cops will run right up with a rock and hit another cop in the head and sometimes they'll hit another cop with a bottle and I mean they'll knock teeth out!
[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:09.425]  And you'll see captains come over and tell the cops to stand down, and the cops will throw fits, and they'll talk them over and explain to them, you're gonna get a promotion, listen, take one for the team!
[00:37:09.725 --> 00:37:14.989]  And then they'll just make the cops sit, and the news will show that and go, why won't they do anything?
[00:37:15.029 --> 00:37:21.113]  And the cops in the anarchist outfits recede, and then they'd say, alright men, open fire!
[00:37:21.633 --> 00:37:23.475]  And they just attack the innocent crowds.
[00:37:23.815 --> 00:37:28.438]  See, it's also about manipulating the dumb bell cop down on the ground.
[00:37:29.111 --> 00:37:35.874]  It's about brainwashing him and brainwashing the dumbbell public watching television.
[00:37:36.395 --> 00:37:39.956]  I remember him on the news for a whole day going, why won't the cops do anything in Seattle?
[00:37:41.417 --> 00:37:43.658]  And also going, why won't they do anything up in Canada?
[00:37:43.678 --> 00:37:48.240]  And there they were on the news, rioting and hitting cops and waving their red flags, and they were cops.
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:55.944]  I mean, believe me, folks, in the real world, you walk up to a cop and you hit him with something, you're probably going to get your head blown off.
[00:37:56.614 --> 00:38:00.496]  Only cops and their hired provocateurs are allowed to hit cops in the head with rocks.
[00:38:01.377 --> 00:38:10.102]  But it doesn't matter, they've now admitted they did it in Canada, they've admitted they did it in Seattle, they've admitted they did it in Italy, in Genoa, they've admitted it over and over and over and over again.
[00:38:10.562 --> 00:38:12.143]  What is it people can't figure out?
[00:38:12.343 --> 00:38:16.065]  They've got a 300 year old word for it, and it's agent provocateur!
[00:38:17.364 --> 00:38:19.246]  Just like there's the term espionage.
[00:38:19.306 --> 00:38:25.891]  The French really perfected this in their fights with the British, but then the British adopted a lot of it and did it better than even they could.
[00:38:26.372 --> 00:38:33.558]  If you read the different histories, even from both sides, the French would agree that the British got even more particularly wheels within wheels of duplicity.
[00:38:34.318 --> 00:38:35.920]  But they do all sorts of things.
[00:38:37.606 --> 00:38:40.787]  The French would go into areas of Brittany and commit massacres.
[00:38:40.827 --> 00:38:52.171]  They'd go into seaports of London, seaports of England, Cornwall, and they would kill people at night and then leave letters saying that, you know, the supporters of the King had done it in Britain.
[00:38:52.751 --> 00:38:54.332]  I mean, this is how they operate.
[00:38:54.572 --> 00:38:57.713]  This is, this is espionage.
[00:38:57.773 --> 00:38:58.693]  It's a French word.
[00:38:58.973 --> 00:39:00.094]  Espionage.
[00:39:01.894 --> 00:39:03.415]  Agent provocateur.
[00:39:09.289 --> 00:39:10.912]  And I just want to get you thinking about it.
[00:39:11.172 --> 00:39:12.134]  That's all I'm asking.
[00:39:13.716 --> 00:39:18.324]  So, on the heels of that, we have the Sydney top riot cop, Sydney News.
[00:39:19.386 --> 00:39:20.688]  This is out of the News of Australia.
[00:39:21.491 --> 00:39:23.511]  We'll descend into chaos, just top riot cops.
[00:39:23.551 --> 00:39:26.212]  Yeah, if anybody's allowed to demonstrate, it'll descend into chaos.
[00:39:26.592 --> 00:39:30.073]  And you better believe they're going to have their provocateurs, 10 or 15 of them, leading the pack.
[00:39:30.553 --> 00:39:32.814]  And they'll be shown on the news, no one arresting them.
[00:39:32.834 --> 00:39:33.714]  You'll see it later today.
[00:39:34.054 --> 00:39:35.194]  It should be out right about now.
[00:39:35.454 --> 00:39:36.354]  Just turn your televisions on.
[00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:37.235]  It should be on for you now.
[00:39:37.695 --> 00:39:40.475]  And you'll just see people rioting and waving flags.
[00:39:40.515 --> 00:39:42.396]  And if you look carefully, you'll notice it's acting.
[00:39:42.416 --> 00:39:43.816]  You can tell when somebody's acting.
[00:39:44.816 --> 00:39:48.157]  And then they'll recede back, and then the cops will attack the general public.
[00:39:49.105 --> 00:39:51.329]  Nine times out of ten, that's how it works.
[00:39:52.952 --> 00:39:55.516]  And then see, he gets to then pose and how smart he is.
[00:39:55.596 --> 00:39:59.663]  See, I told you we'd descend into chaos if we ever allowed a demonstration!
[00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:11.374]  George W. Bush's first dinner in Sydney kicked off with warm welcomes from Australia's leading men, a stand-in date for the U.S.
[00:40:11.434 --> 00:40:17.436]  President, and a request by him to see photos of Prime Minister John Howard's grandson.
[00:40:17.476 --> 00:40:19.797]  See, that's written to personalize Bush.
[00:40:19.997 --> 00:40:20.838]  Total propaganda.
[00:40:21.318 --> 00:40:23.739]  See, every line is crafted.
[00:40:25.712 --> 00:40:35.914]  Two new South Wales police helicopters and at least ten police and maritime boats will call into action to escort the leader of the free world.
[00:40:36.635 --> 00:40:38.155]  Oh, with the banned demonstrations.
[00:40:38.235 --> 00:40:38.895]  It's free.
[00:40:39.455 --> 00:40:44.617]  To his evening engagements with Mr. Howard and Governor General Michael Jeffrey.
[00:40:45.377 --> 00:40:51.538]  Greetings and an exchange of pleasantries included a gesture by Mr. Bush to invite U.S.
[00:40:51.578 --> 00:40:55.079]  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to his dinner date.
[00:40:56.937 --> 00:41:04.041]  So a bunch of sophistry and mindless trivia, personalizing.
[00:41:04.981 --> 00:41:07.103]  Maybe they'll tell us what's on Bush's iPod.
[00:41:07.463 --> 00:41:10.224]  That he eats hamburgers and is a regular guy.
[00:41:12.346 --> 00:41:14.527]  When he's not buying 300,000 acres here, triple oil tankers there.
[00:41:20.538 --> 00:41:23.219]  The President's evening at Henry A. started around 5 p.m.
[00:41:23.259 --> 00:41:38.625]  when he boarded a luxury cruiser for a short voyage across Sydney Harbor for a brief gathering with Major General Geoffrey and his wife Marlena at Admiralty House, followed by dinner next door at
[00:41:39.961 --> 00:41:46.465]  Kerbilly House, hosted by Mr. Howard and his wife, Jeanette, who've turned Australia into a police state, I would add.
[00:41:46.905 --> 00:41:57.731]  Mr. Bush's motorcade swept down from his hotel to the Sydney Opera House, where he boarded the White Cruiser, which earlier took him to the lunch at Garden Island Naval Base.
[00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:09.177]  So, see, they cover all the friendly happinesses, and then they get into horrible, dangerous, rabble, threatened to disturb all of this, and they're allowed to demonstrate there'll be endless riots and destruction.
[00:42:13.103 --> 00:42:22.730]  And it goes on and on and on with General Jeffrey saying, glad to have you here in our Sydney residence, and Bush saying, oh gracious General.
[00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:37.920]  And then it says he had lunch with troops, and it goes on for page after page about the lunching with the troops in the lockstep, how Bush is in lockstep with Mr. Howard for their security and keeping them safe.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:46.327]  Oh, and how their nuclear power together and their military deals and weapon sales.
[00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:58.943]  And then it just mentions that they will descend into total destruction if they let everyone protest or demonstrate.
[00:43:03.442 --> 00:43:04.583]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:43:04.643 --> 00:43:07.304]  It's just that then I get into the other stack of police state news.
[00:43:07.324 --> 00:43:08.104]  Here's the next one.
[00:43:08.164 --> 00:43:08.905]  BBC.
[00:43:09.185 --> 00:43:11.666]  All UK must be on DNA database.
[00:43:11.766 --> 00:43:16.228]  And by the way, Homeland Security has called for a national DNA database here of everyone.
[00:43:16.548 --> 00:43:18.229]  See, first it's anyone who's got a felony.
[00:43:18.249 --> 00:43:19.970]  Then it's anybody who's arrested.
[00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:21.470]  Then it's anybody who's stopped.
[00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:22.010]  Some U.S.
[00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:22.511]  cities are doing it.
[00:43:22.531 --> 00:43:23.171]  Everybody's stopped.
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.721]  And then, oh, just everyone.
[00:43:25.761 --> 00:43:27.722]  And, oh, those DNA kits we took for your kids.
[00:43:27.762 --> 00:43:28.882]  Yeah, those are in a database.
[00:43:29.042 --> 00:43:33.805]  Oh, by the way, if you're 34 or younger and born in a hospital, you're in a federal database.
[00:43:33.825 --> 00:43:34.565]  You didn't know that?
[00:43:34.625 --> 00:43:36.146]  I've had congressmen on to talk about it.
[00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:37.967]  See how they do it?
[00:43:38.667 --> 00:43:42.809]  This plan's a lot bigger than Ronald Reagan or George Bush Sr.
[00:43:42.969 --> 00:43:44.910]  or Bill Clinton or Nixon.
[00:43:45.171 --> 00:43:46.371]  This thing goes on for 50, 60, 100 years.
[00:43:50.777 --> 00:43:57.060]  By the way, they just got around last year announcing in Australia that they had the database that started 34 years ago too!
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.080]  Guess what?
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:07.104]  England, the US, New Zealand, Canada, Australia, all adopted 34 years ago the secret DNA database.
[00:44:08.444 --> 00:44:12.886]  Now they're getting around to telling you about it, you see.
[00:44:14.247 --> 00:44:16.888]  All UK must be on DNA database.
[00:44:18.197 --> 00:44:19.918]  The whole population and every U.K.
[00:44:19.958 --> 00:44:21.999]  visitor, ah, every U.K.
[00:44:22.139 --> 00:44:26.982]  visitor should be added to the National DNA Database, a senior judge has said.
[00:44:27.343 --> 00:44:34.567]  That way they've already got industrialized systems where they can create on an assembly line a special bioweapon that kills only you.
[00:44:35.427 --> 00:44:36.028]  Sounds nice.
[00:44:36.068 --> 00:44:37.569]  Then they can drop by and give you that.
[00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:40.571]  You die a few weeks later, no big deal.
[00:44:41.111 --> 00:44:43.873]  Lord Justice, that's just one of the thousands of lovely uses.
[00:44:44.393 --> 00:44:45.113]  Lord Justice.
[00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:48.392]  See, they're called Lords.
[00:44:49.253 --> 00:44:50.934]  Lord Justice.
[00:44:52.396 --> 00:45:07.229]  Seidley told BBC News that the current, shows him wearing this big wig, the current England and Wales database, which holds DNA from crime subjects and scenes, was... Invincible.
[00:45:08.456 --> 00:45:11.878]  He added it would be fairer to include everybody.
[00:45:12.138 --> 00:45:13.338]  Everyone gets a chip.
[00:45:13.838 --> 00:45:16.680]  Everyone gets a heart plug here on Harkonnen.
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.681]  Everyone gets tracked.
[00:45:20.121 --> 00:45:22.002]  We don't profile the blacks.
[00:45:22.062 --> 00:45:23.823]  We watch all of you.
[00:45:23.863 --> 00:45:25.343]  Don't worry, it's not racist.
[00:45:27.173 --> 00:45:32.858]  He added it would be fairer to include everybody, guilty or innocent on it.
[00:45:33.198 --> 00:45:39.223]  The home office said the database of four million profiles, it helps solve criminal cases.
[00:45:39.563 --> 00:45:43.166]  Then of course they can frame you and plant evidence as well, but the government wouldn't do that.
[00:45:43.607 --> 00:45:47.530]  But to expand it would raise logistical and ethical issues.
[00:45:49.392 --> 00:45:51.113]  To show how criminal their government is.
[00:45:51.133 --> 00:45:55.816]  Remember last year, they just announced, oh, we're all going to play James Bond!
[00:45:55.836 --> 00:45:57.457]  It was in the elementary, third grade.
[00:45:59.398 --> 00:46:04.060]  Don't tell mother, and this was all over the papers when it came out, don't, and the papers acted like it was good.
[00:46:04.781 --> 00:46:08.503]  How dare the parents criticize secret DNA databasing of their children.
[00:46:09.183 --> 00:46:12.105]  I guess the blood ampoules they took at birth weren't enough, so they took
[00:46:14.122 --> 00:46:24.386]  The tissue in the inside of your cheek is very loose and very large cells, so that's where they scoop them out, hundreds of them, not thousands, just with a little wooden dowel.
[00:46:25.827 --> 00:46:28.608]  Tongue depressor, they just, ah, we have you now.
[00:46:29.398 --> 00:46:32.719]  And they told him, you're going to be like James Bond.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.800]  This is actually what it said.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.581]  Do not tell your... It was a script they read in the classroom.
[00:46:37.781 --> 00:46:39.162]  Don't tell your mother and father.
[00:46:39.182 --> 00:46:39.982]  It's our secret.
[00:46:40.162 --> 00:46:41.643]  You're now secret agents!
[00:46:42.043 --> 00:46:44.824]  And it gets them used to being secret little Stasi agents, you see.
[00:46:45.284 --> 00:46:46.084]  You see how that works?
[00:46:47.285 --> 00:46:52.667]  So it also does that, but then it gets them into the DNA database, and most of the children didn't tell their parents.
[00:46:52.687 --> 00:46:54.408]  See, because we're trained to take orders.
[00:46:55.148 --> 00:46:57.929]  Fifty years ago, they'd tell a kid to get in a car, they'd run off and wouldn't do it.
[00:46:59.016 --> 00:47:03.500]  They tell kids to get in cars now, they get in the cars because they're trained to follow orders, folks.
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:08.423]  That's why they have Homeland Security drills where they tell the kids to get on buses and go to FEMA camps.
[00:47:09.244 --> 00:47:12.546]  And where they make parents show IDs to get their kids out and go through barbed wire fences.
[00:47:12.907 --> 00:47:14.188]  It's all part of training.
[00:47:15.509 --> 00:47:16.730]  It's so diabolical.
[00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:26.157]  And they all write manuals on it and have big RFID conferences in Chicago and London and brag about how they're making you submit to it and they use those terms.
[00:47:28.288 --> 00:47:32.870]  Are you trying to figure out how diabolical all of this really is?
[00:47:35.971 --> 00:47:39.893]  And so they retina scanned them and took their DNA and fingerprints biometrically.
[00:47:40.173 --> 00:47:46.276]  And when parents complained they said, there was one article where they sent the police to their home and said, why are you complaining?
[00:47:46.576 --> 00:47:48.417]  We want to fill out a report on you.
[00:47:48.437 --> 00:47:53.659]  And anywhere in England now, Wales, Scotland, it doesn't matter.
[00:47:54.555 --> 00:47:54.875]  Ireland.
[00:47:55.336 --> 00:47:58.017]  You have a camera out, you're talking to people, you're interviewing people on the notepad.
[00:47:58.037 --> 00:47:59.358]  The cops walk up and go, what are you doing?
[00:47:59.538 --> 00:48:00.399]  Give me that, please!
[00:48:00.779 --> 00:48:01.820]  ID immediate!
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:02.200]  That, mmm!
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:05.662]  You know, being put on a database for watching.
[00:48:06.042 --> 00:48:10.305]  Again, it's a chilling effect, because they're criminals and they're scared.
[00:48:10.345 --> 00:48:13.967]  And they know that we know they blew up those buses, that bus and those cranes.
[00:48:14.287 --> 00:48:15.648]  We know they carried out 9-11.
[00:48:15.708 --> 00:48:17.409]  We know they sucked the pension funds dry.
[00:48:17.689 --> 00:48:18.530]  We know they're crooks.
[00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:23.793]  And so they're trying to shove us around right now and train us to line up and do what they say and be their slaves.
[00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:26.389]  Bottom line.
[00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:29.630]  And I, for one, am not going to put up with it.
[00:48:31.991 --> 00:48:33.111]  And the articles go on.
[00:48:33.391 --> 00:48:36.512]  I've got another story where somebody paid with a $2 bill and got arrested.
[00:48:37.372 --> 00:48:40.152]  That's how dumbed down the public is, but that's how secret police they are.
[00:48:42.953 --> 00:48:47.454]  I've got another story where somebody went into a circuit city, bought a video game,
[00:48:48.368 --> 00:49:16.165]  was walking out with it in the bag and they wanted to search and they said no thank you so they ran out and stopped them and the cops came and they had the receipt and they said we're just going to go ahead and arrest you anyways you should have submitted no law it actually had the news articles go read it on Infowars.net right now we're trying to get the young man on he was polite he said no no thank you I don't show to be searched same thing happened to Mike Hanson he used to do camera work for me got caught on video
[00:49:17.873 --> 00:49:21.375]  He was walking out of a Hollywood video up at William Cannon and I-35.
[00:49:21.575 --> 00:49:25.598]  I had to be on the radio doing a Saturday night show at the time.
[00:49:25.618 --> 00:49:27.218]  Doing six nights a week then.
[00:49:27.238 --> 00:49:29.820]  This would come full circle.
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.061]  I'm doing that again, but now it's Sunday night.
[00:49:32.061 --> 00:49:38.805]  And, uh, he walks out and this off-duty sheriff's deputy who'd seen us at County Commissioner's Court shutting down one of their programs.
[00:49:39.966 --> 00:49:40.726]  Well, the alarm went off.
[00:49:40.786 --> 00:49:43.108]  And he said, yeah, go ahead, go ahead, yeah.
[00:49:45.057 --> 00:49:46.298]  The guy comes up and says, I want to search you.
[00:49:46.318 --> 00:49:47.259]  And he says, I'm wearing a t-shirt.
[00:49:47.319 --> 00:49:48.880]  This is my nine-year-old daughter.
[00:49:50.361 --> 00:49:51.802]  We just rented a Disney movie.
[00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:52.342]  Here it is.
[00:49:52.702 --> 00:49:53.423]  He said, I want to search you.
[00:49:53.443 --> 00:49:54.583]  And he said, no, you're not going to touch me.
[00:49:54.604 --> 00:49:55.924]  I'm wearing shorts and a shirt.
[00:49:57.145 --> 00:49:58.086]  And he said, I'm going to search you.
[00:49:58.186 --> 00:49:59.667]  And the lady ran out and said, no, no, it's OK.
[00:49:59.707 --> 00:50:00.768]  The manager, it's all right.
[00:50:00.788 --> 00:50:01.888]  It's just been, it's malfunctioning.
[00:50:02.149 --> 00:50:03.389]  And he said, I'm going to search you.
[00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:05.571]  And my, it's all about power.
[00:50:06.323 --> 00:50:08.505]  He also later came out and knew who Mike was and didn't like him.
[00:50:08.525 --> 00:50:09.926]  And Mike said no and went and got in his car.
[00:50:10.386 --> 00:50:10.907]  Rolled up the window.
[00:50:10.927 --> 00:50:11.808]  They knocked the window out.
[00:50:12.088 --> 00:50:12.608]  Beat him up.
[00:50:12.648 --> 00:50:13.289]  Took him to jail.
[00:50:13.569 --> 00:50:14.550]  Then tortured him in jail.
[00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:15.831]  Even got the video of that.
[00:50:16.812 --> 00:50:17.852]  They don't even care, folks.
[00:50:18.933 --> 00:50:20.334]  And, you see, that's the new America.
[00:50:21.195 --> 00:50:21.535]  You see?
[00:50:21.555 --> 00:50:26.179]  The illegal aliens don't have to have an ID card to get a bank account or a car loan or a housing loan.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.502]  But the citizens... Oh!
[00:50:30.623 --> 00:50:34.446]  You didn't let them search you leaving the store.
[00:50:34.906 --> 00:50:35.767]  You got a receipt.
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:38.341]  But I'm going to go ahead and take you in.
[00:50:40.181 --> 00:50:40.702]  I'm going to go ahead.
[00:50:40.762 --> 00:50:41.362]  It's right here.
[00:50:41.822 --> 00:50:43.803]  I'm going to go ahead and just take you in, brother.
[00:50:44.463 --> 00:50:45.884]  You're going to learn to submit to us.
[00:50:45.944 --> 00:50:46.504]  You understand?
[00:50:46.904 --> 00:50:47.865]  You're in the Army now.
[00:50:48.345 --> 00:50:48.785]  That's what it is.
[00:50:48.845 --> 00:50:50.066]  It's martial law.
[00:50:50.586 --> 00:50:52.927]  Martial means under military law.
[00:50:53.427 --> 00:50:54.948]  Admiralty ruling.
[00:50:55.228 --> 00:50:57.149]  Your calls the second we come back.
[00:50:57.469 --> 00:50:57.889]  Stay with me.
[00:51:04.964 --> 00:51:10.411]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.812 --> 00:51:18.422]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.133 --> 00:51:26.177]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.597 --> 00:51:38.023]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.323 --> 00:51:41.825]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.286 --> 00:51:44.207]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.547 --> 00:51:48.329]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:14.523 --> 00:52:29.094]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:29.134 --> 00:52:29.454]  government.
[00:52:29.615 --> 00:52:31.356]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.

[00:54:12.746 --> 00:54:18.327]  First off, I work and also I go to school at Mississippi College here in
[00:54:38.581 --> 00:54:40.602]  Clinton, Mississippi, which is right outside of Jackson.
[00:54:41.443 --> 00:54:45.305]  Well, I work with international students, a lot of foreign students, Chinese mainly.
[00:54:45.806 --> 00:54:51.269]  Well, I had some over for Labor Day and one comes up to me and he says, Samuel, why is the U.S.
[00:54:51.749 --> 00:54:53.270]  military recruiting me for the Army?
[00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:54.611]  And I was like, what are you talking about?
[00:54:54.631 --> 00:54:56.252]  He says, the U.S.
[00:54:56.312 --> 00:55:01.356]  Army has called me twice and talked to me about joining.
[00:55:01.376 --> 00:55:03.357]  And I said, well, can you show me some proof of this?
[00:55:03.857 --> 00:55:07.940]  So he brings me over some pamphlets and documents that they gave him with his name on them.
[00:55:08.715 --> 00:55:33.193]  Yeah, in fact in and I can't go back and fix it now because I was using like three-year-old numbers were the best I could find and I'm gonna hold you over don't worry this is an important subject I say that there's over a hundred and fifty thousand foreigners in our military in the film Endgame now I just got new numbers out
[00:55:33.945 --> 00:55:42.852]  I was in an Associated Press this weekend saying it's 400,000 foreigners, foreign-born, some cases even illegal.
[00:55:43.652 --> 00:55:46.034]  So, I mean, the number is exponential.
[00:55:46.094 --> 00:55:47.915]  Soon it will be the majority.
[00:55:48.256 --> 00:55:49.877]  But, I'm sorry, go ahead and finish your statement.
[00:55:50.512 --> 00:55:52.753]  I mean, this guy has been in the States for eight months.
[00:55:52.793 --> 00:55:54.814]  He barely even speaks English, and they're recruiting him.
[00:55:54.854 --> 00:55:56.595]  So I went to the recruiting office.
[00:55:56.615 --> 00:56:00.778]  It was like, uh, because I thought maybe the Pampas were just generally... I wish you'd have brought a video camera.
[00:56:00.798 --> 00:56:02.659]  That would have been absolute dynamite on the web.
[00:56:02.939 --> 00:56:04.099]  People have to see this, though.
[00:56:04.119 --> 00:56:04.800]  They're hearing you.
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:05.720]  They're not believing you.
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:07.781]  I'm talking about mainline neocons and liberals.
[00:56:08.602 --> 00:56:10.363]  I'm begging you, go back with a video camera.
[00:56:10.643 --> 00:56:12.964]  You know, just chop it together and throw it on YouTube.
[00:56:13.665 --> 00:56:14.165]  I'll shut up.
[00:56:14.205 --> 00:56:14.425]  Go ahead.
[00:56:15.856 --> 00:56:20.197]  I went there and asked him because I thought maybe it was just general information that they sent to random people.
[00:56:20.217 --> 00:56:24.819]  And I showed him the pamphlet without showing him the name of the student or saying he was Chinese.
[00:56:24.839 --> 00:56:26.719]  And I said, well, how did people get these pamphlets?
[00:56:26.739 --> 00:56:29.120]  He's like, oh, we decide who gets those.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:30.741]  We decide who we send those to.
[00:56:31.041 --> 00:56:32.721]  Those are not random handouts.
[00:56:32.781 --> 00:56:34.322]  We give those to who we want to give them to.
[00:56:34.342 --> 00:56:35.602]  We know who we're giving them to.
[00:56:36.082 --> 00:56:38.003]  And I said, well, you're giving them to foreigners.
[00:56:38.043 --> 00:56:41.604]  And he just kind of smiled and smirked and then asked me if I was interested in joining.
[00:56:42.291 --> 00:56:43.759]  He didn't really have anything to say about it.
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:45.228]  Oh, he doesn't want you, brother!
[00:56:46.222 --> 00:56:55.528]  They want Ukrainians, they want Czechoslovakians, they want Bulgarians, they want Hungarians, who are good people, by the way, in their countries.
[00:56:55.548 --> 00:56:58.030]  They're really awake, but they want the military types to come over here.
[00:56:58.811 --> 00:57:00.051]  And it's mainly Latin Americans.
[00:57:00.091 --> 00:57:04.074]  We're going to be ruled, just like in Red Dawn, but it's happening with the doors open.
[00:57:04.094 --> 00:57:07.016]  They're not paratrooping in to Wolverine High School.
[00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:09.138]  And it's here.
[00:57:09.378 --> 00:57:15.662]  I mean, look, you're going to be ruled, America, by Latin Americans and Chinese and Eastern blockers.
[00:57:16.382 --> 00:57:18.084]  And I mean, you can't make this stuff up!
[00:57:18.884 --> 00:57:22.306]  By the way, they're also going after aggravated felons.
[00:57:22.347 --> 00:57:23.467]  That's mainstream news.
[00:57:28.111 --> 00:57:28.771]  What else did he say?
[00:57:28.791 --> 00:57:30.952]  I mean, did you bring up the fact that they're hiring aggravated felons?
[00:57:31.813 --> 00:57:32.614]  No, I didn't bring up that.
[00:57:32.634 --> 00:57:35.276]  I just said, you know, this guy's Chinese.
[00:57:35.296 --> 00:57:36.316]  He barely even speaks English.
[00:57:36.817 --> 00:57:37.937]  Why would you be recruiting him?
[00:57:37.997 --> 00:57:40.079]  He just kind of smiled and smirked and didn't answer.
[00:57:42.615 --> 00:57:43.515]  It's real funny.
[00:57:43.975 --> 00:57:45.416]  Those guys are so disreputable.
[00:57:45.696 --> 00:57:53.860]  Have you heard the audio of them from Houston to Denver where they call up the 16-year-olds and say, you're going to prison if you don't come sign into the military.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.801]  I order you now to come sign in.
[00:57:55.981 --> 00:57:56.982]  Don't tell your parents.
[00:57:58.303 --> 00:57:59.683]  They're totally disreputable.
[00:58:00.664 --> 00:58:03.165]  Let me tell you about this one more thing and I'll be done.
[00:58:04.386 --> 00:58:06.307]  They just brought in a new professor here at the school.
[00:58:07.518 --> 00:58:12.761]  Admittedly, ex-CIA, ex-Marine, he's done all this anti-terrorism, counter-terrorism task force stuff.
[00:58:13.461 --> 00:58:18.443]  Well, he comes in teaching, and I took him for a couple classes purposely, just to get a feel of him.
[00:58:18.744 --> 00:58:19.784]  What the enemy's doing to him?
[00:58:20.284 --> 00:58:23.286]  I'm not kidding you when I say he's standing up there preaching neocon.
[00:58:23.306 --> 00:58:24.426]  We need to be in Iraq.
[00:58:24.466 --> 00:58:25.887]  We need to give up our liberties.
[00:58:25.907 --> 00:58:27.128]  We need to be in Syria.
[00:58:27.488 --> 00:58:28.929]  We're going to attack Iran.
[00:58:28.969 --> 00:58:30.269]  We're going to attack Iran soon.
[00:58:30.329 --> 00:58:30.810]  Well, stay there.
[00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:32.050]  I want to hear more about this.
[00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:35.272]  We'll get to Charles and John and Roman and Thomas and everybody else.
[00:58:36.244 --> 00:58:37.926]  Oh yeah, they're preaching everywhere, folks.
[00:58:37.966 --> 00:58:39.507]  They'll run death camps of order, too.
[00:58:41.549 --> 00:58:46.433]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.506 --> 00:58:58.147]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.827 --> 00:58:59.848]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:01.709]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:03.170]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.931 --> 00:59:04.832]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.852 --> 00:59:09.435]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.676 --> 00:59:14.099]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:18.262]  We can and we must defeat the New World Order.
[00:59:18.422 --> 00:59:25.708]  Big news on the out-of-control push for a global taxation grid under the guise of global warming coming up.
[00:59:26.377 --> 00:59:27.678]  McDonald's gets in on it.
[00:59:27.718 --> 00:59:28.979]  Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:59:29.059 --> 00:59:30.019]  Big developments there.
[00:59:30.079 --> 00:59:32.921]  Also, news on the economic front.
[00:59:32.961 --> 00:59:34.942]  What's happening with the gear up for Iran.
[00:59:34.962 --> 00:59:37.103]  A bunch of police state news.
[00:59:38.444 --> 00:59:40.005]  But we're taking calls right now.
[00:59:40.025 --> 00:59:41.646]  And I'm going to get to everybody that's patiently holding.
[00:59:41.666 --> 00:59:43.607]  We're talking to Samuel, though, in Louisiana.
[00:59:44.067 --> 00:59:45.428]  And he goes to university there.
[00:59:45.448 --> 00:59:48.529]  And I don't need to confirm what Samuel's saying.
[00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:49.610]  No, it's true, because I have.
[00:59:50.746 --> 00:59:52.567]  I knew about this six, seven years ago.
[00:59:52.607 --> 00:59:54.027]  They started recruiting felons.
[00:59:54.447 --> 00:59:56.148]  Then it came out in a few newspapers.
[00:59:56.728 --> 00:59:58.669]  Washington Times, AP reported on them both.
[00:59:59.469 --> 01:00:01.750]  And I remember reading it going, they're hiring aggravated felons.
[01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:03.091]  But see, they keep it real quiet.
[01:00:03.631 --> 01:00:04.531]  And the fact that there are now 400,000.
[01:00:04.891 --> 01:00:08.113]  Now, I just learned this a few days ago.
[01:00:08.133 --> 01:00:09.033]  I thought it was 150,000.
[01:00:09.333 --> 01:00:09.873]  It's grown.
[01:00:09.913 --> 01:00:11.354]  Just in a few years, it's gone up.
[01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:11.914]  Doubled.
[01:00:12.194 --> 01:00:12.754]  More than doubled.
[01:00:14.275 --> 01:00:16.796]  And I mean, we're only talking about a million and something man army here.
[01:00:16.816 --> 01:00:18.716]  400,000 are foreigners.
[01:00:20.777 --> 01:00:22.458]  And a lot of those were illegal aliens legalized.
[01:00:22.478 --> 01:00:22.958]  We're in trouble.
[01:00:23.298 --> 01:00:30.202]  So this young man goes down to the recruiter and he, you know, it's just a big joke to them that they were recruiting a guy from China, been here eight months.
[01:00:31.922 --> 01:00:33.043]  He got into his next story.
[01:00:33.243 --> 01:00:35.244]  What university are you at particularly?
[01:00:35.624 --> 01:00:36.765]  Who is this professor?
[01:00:37.225 --> 01:00:39.386]  And describe him and exactly what he says.
[01:00:40.947 --> 01:00:42.527]  Well, I'm in Mississippi, not Louisiana.
[01:00:42.547 --> 01:00:43.288]  Mississippi College.
[01:00:43.308 --> 01:00:43.788]  Mississippi.
[01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:45.149]  I don't know why I said Louisiana.
[01:00:45.949 --> 01:00:47.410]  I've got Louisiana written here on the board.
[01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.290]  Go ahead.
[01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:49.151]  You're in Mississippi.
[01:00:49.191 --> 01:00:49.831]  Tell us where you're at.
[01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:52.973]  I go to Mississippi College, it's a conservative Christian college.
[01:00:53.934 --> 01:00:57.737]  But the professor, Dr. Clifton Sherrill, like I said, he's admittedly XCIA.
[01:00:57.757 --> 01:01:00.060]  He kind of bragged about it, you know, every class period.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.302]  Well, I took him for a couple classes.
[01:01:02.642 --> 01:01:05.245]  I took him for a terrorism class.
[01:01:05.265 --> 01:01:06.446]  That was the main thing I took him for.
[01:01:06.506 --> 01:01:09.990]  And he comes in and he admittedly says Al Qaeda does not exist.
[01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:11.231]  There's no such thing as Al Qaeda.
[01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:12.472]  The media portrays it falsely.
[01:01:12.492 --> 01:01:13.373]  But then he turns around
[01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:16.465]  With his little double thinking says, oh Al-Qaeda is in Iran.
[01:01:16.505 --> 01:01:18.067]  We need to go in Iran.
[01:01:18.127 --> 01:01:19.107]  You know, I'm for it.
[01:01:19.268 --> 01:01:19.888]  We're going to be there.
[01:01:19.928 --> 01:01:20.288]  Don't worry.
[01:01:20.308 --> 01:01:23.671]  Have you said to him, Iran Shiite and hunt down Al-Qaeda?
[01:01:23.951 --> 01:01:26.433]  And that Bush signed orders three months ago.
[01:01:26.453 --> 01:01:32.058]  It's been going on for three years with public orders to have the number three Al-Qaeda commander launch attacks on Iran?
[01:01:32.078 --> 01:01:34.920]  Well, I would give him news articles.
[01:01:35.001 --> 01:01:37.783]  I would give him books and things and say, hey, watch this, read this.
[01:01:37.803 --> 01:01:39.144]  But he would never get back to me on them.
[01:01:40.021 --> 01:01:41.902]  Well that's because he knows.
[01:01:41.962 --> 01:01:45.223]  I mean, he's there to, you know, fill you kids full of propaganda.
[01:01:45.743 --> 01:01:46.224]  Exactly.
[01:01:46.304 --> 01:01:55.347]  I mean, it's really ridiculous the way he says, you know, Shia and Sunni, they hate each other, but Al-Qaeda, that doesn't exist, is in Iran, and we're going to attack Iran.
[01:01:55.387 --> 01:01:56.007]  Don't you worry.
[01:01:56.107 --> 01:01:56.408]  I know.
[01:01:56.468 --> 01:01:57.488]  I got the inside scoop.
[01:01:57.528 --> 01:01:58.388]  We'll be in Iran.
[01:01:58.809 --> 01:01:59.889]  You know, he says things like this.
[01:02:00.376 --> 01:02:09.001]  And just the whole class is just, uh, yeah, let's go to Iran, let's kill them, you know, and I'm just sitting there just... And they like being lied to and being told Shiite is Al Qaeda.
[01:02:09.121 --> 01:02:10.061]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:02:10.822 --> 01:02:15.504]  And he, uh... But he, he... I got him pretty aggravated there.
[01:02:15.544 --> 01:02:23.909]  He wanted us to do a paper on terrorism, so I decided to do domestic terrorism, and I did, uh, Branch Davidians and how screwed up the ATF was on all that stuff.
[01:02:24.389 --> 01:02:26.490]  And let's just say he didn't grade me very well on that.
[01:02:27.287 --> 01:02:31.490]  Well, that's a real sign of an intellectual coward when they grade you badly because they disagree with you.
[01:02:32.871 --> 01:02:40.217]  Look, this guy was some... Look, their whole system is filled with ninnies and toadies and people like Senator Craig.
[01:02:40.717 --> 01:02:42.118]  It's just time to stand up against them.
[01:02:43.737 --> 01:02:44.718]  Well, I appreciate you taking my call.
[01:02:44.738 --> 01:02:45.959]  I've been listening to you for a while.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:46.981]  I appreciate you waking me up.
[01:02:47.241 --> 01:02:49.263]  I'm locking myself up to the New World Order, man.
[01:02:49.283 --> 01:03:01.376]  Well, I appreciate you, Samuel, but I'd ask you to write up your experiences at that school with the recruiters, your experiences with that professor, and I would ask you to send it to Aaron at InfoWars.com or to Paul Watson over at Prison Planet.
[01:03:01.396 --> 01:03:02.738]  Just click the link that says Webmaster.
[01:03:03.158 --> 01:03:07.880]  Because it's these type of experiences that you have that don't need to just be spewed out in the ether.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.021]  When it's written down, millions over time will see it.
[01:03:11.301 --> 01:03:14.662]  They can check names, they can... The written word is hard to corrupt.
[01:03:15.163 --> 01:03:23.986]  Audio... I mean, I can read... Dr. Corsi just wrote a big article about civilian inmate labor camps with the very same documents that we uncovered in the mid-1990s.
[01:03:24.706 --> 01:03:26.347]  And I'm glad World Hunt Daily's finally on it.
[01:03:26.923 --> 01:03:35.366]  And we wrote articles about it too, but the point is that's why it's getting attention now that the military's open in prison camps is because it's finally been written about in a big publication.
[01:03:36.366 --> 01:03:37.847]  The key is having it written.
[01:03:37.867 --> 01:03:44.509]  Alright, Charles, John, Roman, Thomas, I'm gonna try to accelerate through your calls, but they're all so good.
[01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:49.731]  I mean, look at all that information you just got about Mississippi University.
[01:03:54.904 --> 01:03:55.944]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:03:56.264 --> 01:03:59.065]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:03:59.325 --> 01:04:03.467]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:04:03.907 --> 01:04:04.747]  So what do you do?
[01:04:05.047 --> 01:04:09.609]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:12.231]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:04:12.732 --> 01:04:27.426]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:04:27.466 --> 01:04:34.533]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:04:34.873 --> 01:04:39.276]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[01:04:55.991 --> 01:05:01.475]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:01.835 --> 01:05:09.460]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.157 --> 01:05:17.221]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.621 --> 01:05:29.067]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.367 --> 01:05:32.889]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:35.291]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.591 --> 01:05:39.433]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.523 --> 01:05:57.886]  The Digestive Tract, a natural waste factory built within all of our bodies.
[01:05:58.286 --> 01:06:03.289]  Roughly 25 feet of tunnels designed to absorb nutrition and then dispel the waste.
[01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:05.571]  But what happens when the waste gets clogged up?
[01:06:06.275 --> 01:06:13.298]  More than 4 million Americans have frequent constipation, accounting for 2.5 million physician visits a year.
[01:06:13.759 --> 01:06:18.701]  Now there's AlloCleanse, an all-natural formula based on herbs and safe enzymes.
[01:06:19.021 --> 01:06:24.404]  AlloCleanse gently sweeps the entire digestive tract and supports comfortable regular bathroom habits.
[01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:30.867]  You'll feel lighter, and you'll feel clean inside, and when you remove the waste buildup with AlloCleanse, you'll have more energy.
[01:06:31.147 --> 01:06:34.749]  Energy to use on other things, besides worrying about constipation.
[01:06:35.251 --> 01:06:40.095]  For a risk-free trial of Allocleanse, call 1-800-890-3525.

[01:06:46.139 --> 01:06:46.339]  That's 1-800-890-3525.
[01:06:46.359 --> 01:06:49.121]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:49.241 --> 01:06:50.442]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.372 --> 01:07:07.653]  Every day I look at the news.
[01:07:07.773 --> 01:07:11.914]  Every day I see things that happen that even blow me away.
[01:07:11.934 --> 01:07:19.778]  I mean, it's hard to believe I've made this film in-game that is very well done, very professional.
[01:07:20.498 --> 01:07:22.179]  People are saying it's the best film I've ever made.
[01:07:22.199 --> 01:07:26.341]  You know, it's head to shoulders even above Terror Storm, which is an excellent film.
[01:07:27.361 --> 01:07:30.362]  But still, you watch it and you're like, they really want to kill everybody?
[01:07:30.402 --> 01:07:31.003]  They really?
[01:07:31.583 --> 01:07:33.784]  And then they write it and they say it and they do it.
[01:07:35.177 --> 01:07:37.497]  They really are turning our military into foreign troops.
[01:07:37.557 --> 01:07:41.318]  They're not landing like the old-timers said they would, you know, and paratrooping out of the sky.
[01:07:41.338 --> 01:07:52.581]  They're just taking over that way, and just handing the roads over for international taxation, and banning protests and demonstrations, and talking about forced health care.
[01:07:52.661 --> 01:07:53.981]  I mean, it's just all happening.
[01:07:58.122 --> 01:08:01.542]  It's hard to believe that all of this stuff really is coming true.
[01:08:01.662 --> 01:08:04.703]  I just... It's amazing.
[01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:09.013]  Let's go to Charles, Louisiana, then John Roman, Thomas Cliff, and others.
[01:08:09.273 --> 01:08:09.954]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:08:09.994 --> 01:08:10.834]  Always good to hear from you.
[01:08:11.135 --> 01:08:12.416]  Yes, sir.
[01:08:12.436 --> 01:08:14.838]  I want to talk about the truckers, but I want to say this before.
[01:08:15.198 --> 01:08:18.721]  Boeing is building more tanker spray planes for George Bush in Idaho.
[01:08:19.241 --> 01:08:20.262]  I think it's in Idaho, yeah.
[01:08:20.642 --> 01:08:23.745]  He ordered more tanker planes, so he can spray a lot more now.
[01:08:24.846 --> 01:08:26.847]  But anyway, I want to talk about the truckers.
[01:08:27.488 --> 01:08:30.310]  Mr. Jones, they're not taking over the truck company.
[01:08:31.952 --> 01:08:33.114]  Especially from the teamsters.
[01:08:33.134 --> 01:08:34.156]  We call the teamsters.
[01:08:34.216 --> 01:08:35.799]  I was on this from the first day.
[01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:40.047]  And we started, you know, passing flyers out and all on truck stops.
[01:08:40.529 --> 01:08:42.829]  And the teamsters told us they couldn't get involved in this.
[01:08:42.849 --> 01:08:43.590]  They couldn't, you know.
[01:08:43.730 --> 01:08:46.030]  Oh yeah, the teamsters are total politicians.
[01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:49.291]  They just take the dues and act like they're fighting.
[01:08:49.331 --> 01:08:54.892]  Back when there were real unions, they'd send out Pinkerton men in Chicago and New York and mow down 200 people.
[01:08:54.912 --> 01:08:57.032]  I was a longshoreman.
[01:08:57.332 --> 01:08:58.072]  I was a longshoreman.
[01:08:58.112 --> 01:09:05.514]  So the longshoremen in L.A., that's what I am, by trade, they're going to lose something like over a million jobs because of this.
[01:09:06.329 --> 01:09:07.369]  Over a million jobs.
[01:09:07.589 --> 01:09:08.310]  Do you realize that?
[01:09:08.790 --> 01:09:10.290]  It's well more than a million.
[01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:18.573]  I mean, this thing is almost twice the size the Cardenas port of the Gulf of Houston, the port of Houston, the biggest port in the United States.
[01:09:19.193 --> 01:09:20.914]  Yeah, well, they're saying over a million in unions.
[01:09:20.994 --> 01:09:21.414]  I don't know.
[01:09:22.054 --> 01:09:23.535]  Some of them are non-union, you know.
[01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:25.382]  We're good to go.
[01:09:40.245 --> 01:09:43.306]  We should be blaming the American people for not taking action.
[01:09:43.686 --> 01:09:47.867]  I've been up there, and you've been up there for years, asking these people to get these tapes.
[01:09:47.947 --> 01:09:49.367]  Just get tapes and pass them out.
[01:09:49.787 --> 01:09:56.769]  And about the kids being vaccinated, you've been up there for years, and these stupid people still do nothing.
[01:09:57.289 --> 01:09:59.489]  What is the percentage of the listeners that do nothing?
[01:09:59.669 --> 01:10:01.030]  This is what makes me sick of them.
[01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:06.791]  Well, at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to tell a story about the Endgame premiere last night that deals with vaccines.
[01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:15.735]  In fact, I gave that card with one lady's name, I think I gave that to Aaron, but we're going to get her on as a guest.
[01:10:16.236 --> 01:10:23.561]  We shot video of it, but I want to get her permission to put it on the web, because it'll save lives, people hearing it, but it's quite a story.
[01:10:23.581 --> 01:10:24.402]  I'll tell that later.
[01:10:24.962 --> 01:10:26.544]  Yeah, I mean, you're trying to save lives.
[01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:30.206]  These stupid people act like they can live here forever.
[01:10:30.527 --> 01:10:31.447]  It's at the end.
[01:10:31.788 --> 01:10:32.768]  I think you're right.
[01:10:33.008 --> 01:10:36.251]  This year, something's going to happen, and these people are going to go crazy.
[01:10:36.658 --> 01:10:43.842]  I told you seven years ago, eight years ago when I started this, Mr. Jones, I started passing you tapes out, I said the American people ain't got the guts to stand up for this.
[01:10:43.862 --> 01:10:44.822]  You said they're going to have to.
[01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:51.366]  And I want to know where are the people, where are the people, they got the information, why ain't they giving it out?
[01:10:51.486 --> 01:10:52.726]  Are they that dumb or are they that scared?
[01:10:52.746 --> 01:11:01.591]  Well, to them the world seems like a big, big place and they don't, they don't see themselves as interacting in the world or changing things.
[01:11:01.631 --> 01:11:03.492]  They see themselves as passive.
[01:11:04.085 --> 01:11:05.827]  You know, there's a store, they go shop in it.
[01:11:05.847 --> 01:11:07.248]  There's a highway, they drive down it.
[01:11:07.268 --> 01:11:08.810]  There's a bill comes in the mail, they pay it.
[01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:10.732]  There's a new tax, they submit to it.
[01:11:11.092 --> 01:11:13.434]  A cop says lick their boots, they get down and start licking.
[01:11:15.216 --> 01:11:16.637]  That's just how they operate.
[01:11:16.797 --> 01:11:17.718]  It's all American people.
[01:11:17.939 --> 01:11:19.380]  Let me tell you this one story and I'll hang up.
[01:11:20.044 --> 01:11:22.827]  Uh, my wife's cousin, he was in construction.
[01:11:22.867 --> 01:11:25.150]  Well, they ain't no more construction work for the American Struckers.
[01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:27.452]  It's only illegal aliens, yeah.
[01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:32.478]  Yeah, so he couldn't have no houses, so he went up there to try to get a job with the aliens.
[01:11:32.498 --> 01:11:33.859]  See, they told him they couldn't use them.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.324]  They have enough people, so he's not going to be out of work for six weeks now.
[01:11:39.446 --> 01:11:40.526]  And he's trying to get a job.
[01:11:40.667 --> 01:11:43.308]  He's trying to get a job with the same pay the airlines are getting.
[01:11:43.328 --> 01:11:44.288]  He don't have no work.
[01:11:44.728 --> 01:11:52.591]  For the last three weeks, there's supposed to be some houses coming up, and he went up there and they told him, American contractors say, no I can't use you, I got too many now.
[01:11:53.812 --> 01:11:58.273]  And he tried to get the same pay, seven hours an hour, whatever, he was getting $15 an hour.
[01:11:58.994 --> 01:11:59.854]  And they wouldn't take him.
[01:12:01.355 --> 01:12:02.215]  That's how bad it is.
[01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:07.776]  Well, all over the country, they're saying, hey, if it's not Espanol, you don't got a job here.
[01:12:07.796 --> 01:12:08.977]  Get out.
[01:12:08.997 --> 01:12:11.119]  Well, when they're hungry, maybe they might do something.
[01:12:11.319 --> 01:12:12.621]  I hope they get you new tape.
[01:12:13.081 --> 01:12:17.485]  Maybe this new tape might wake some of these dead heads up and do something.
[01:12:17.785 --> 01:12:19.547]  But they better get out there and try to do it.
[01:12:20.824 --> 01:12:24.766]  I think a lot of them are going to have to go to FEMA camps.
[01:12:25.146 --> 01:12:29.967]  Mr. Jones, it would be the best thing for them to have their wives torn from their arms and their babies.
[01:12:30.288 --> 01:12:37.150]  It would really do them good because I think that's what made me really wake up when I got in prison and got them weapons and went out late at night.
[01:12:38.210 --> 01:12:39.491]  I think that's what will do them good.
[01:12:39.511 --> 01:12:41.552]  Hello?
[01:12:41.632 --> 01:12:44.933]  No, I think in the final equation that's what judgment's all about.
[01:12:45.213 --> 01:12:46.513]  You've been out here for years.
[01:12:47.534 --> 01:12:48.094]  I've seen you.
[01:12:48.902 --> 01:12:54.304]  They just cry, I cried on the radio, waking these stupid people up and they won't even listen.
[01:12:54.324 --> 01:13:09.229]  They'll listen to you and go off and go to a baseball game, a football game, go get pizza, and laugh and joke, and you giving your heart out to them, and they're experimenting on these people, being sprayed, they don't have no respect for their children, I mean, don't these American people have respect for themselves?
[01:13:09.269 --> 01:13:14.051]  They're the dumbest, scatterest people in the world, and they deserve to lose this country, Mr. Jones!
[01:13:14.731 --> 01:13:15.872]  They deserve to lose it!
[01:13:16.072 --> 01:13:19.115]  The problem is, in the fall of the Republic, we're all going to get crushed.
[01:13:19.155 --> 01:13:21.457]  That's why we've got to try to avert what's happening.
[01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:22.498]  I appreciate your call.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.641]  I really do, and I understand your frustration.
[01:13:25.701 --> 01:13:26.582]  John in New York.
[01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:27.383]  You're on the air, John.
[01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.003]  Thanks for holding.
[01:13:29.345 --> 01:13:29.645]  Hey, Al.
[01:13:29.685 --> 01:13:30.025]  How are you?
[01:13:30.326 --> 01:13:30.606]  Hi.
[01:13:30.646 --> 01:13:31.226]  Thanks for calling.
[01:13:31.947 --> 01:13:33.449]  Hey, a couple quick things.
[01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:37.292]  First of all, there's a video game out now.
[01:13:37.312 --> 01:13:40.275]  I know you don't like video games, but I've noticed recently
[01:13:41.159 --> 01:13:44.781]  A lot of the ones I find, it starts to be like the programmers are whistleblowers.
[01:13:45.361 --> 01:13:51.424]  There's this one game out called Black, where you're a top secret CIA killing squad.
[01:13:51.504 --> 01:13:52.564]  Yeah, Black Ops.
[01:13:52.824 --> 01:13:53.545]  I know.
[01:13:53.885 --> 01:13:55.686]  One of the guy's defects goes to Russia.
[01:13:56.126 --> 01:14:04.549]  You get sent in to take him out, and right when you're about to find this guy, you find a document titled W199I.
[01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:07.971]  You find the quote, originals of Pruderfilm.
[01:14:08.618 --> 01:14:11.059]  And you also find a DVD titled The Order of Death.
[01:14:12.199 --> 01:14:13.400]  So I thought I should share that with you.
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:14.400]  I thought that would make you happy.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.021]  What's the name of the video game?
[01:14:16.401 --> 01:14:16.701]  Black.
[01:14:17.081 --> 01:14:17.921]  That's a great name.
[01:14:18.321 --> 01:14:26.784]  Yeah, I probably get a call a week, people wanting me to be in their video game, wanting me to voice their video games.
[01:14:27.644 --> 01:14:30.725]  And I send them emails back and go, look, you can use clips from the show, do whatever you want.
[01:14:30.765 --> 01:14:34.347]  I'm so busy that I'm not whining here.
[01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:35.027]  I just literally
[01:14:36.703 --> 01:14:41.146]  I'm sure I have to brush my teeth fast, because I'm so busy and I don't want to spend any time with my family.
[01:14:41.707 --> 01:14:47.651]  And I know there's a lot of video games now, putting the truth out, and I commend them.
[01:14:47.711 --> 01:14:54.476]  And see, that's why we're going to win this fight, is that there are a lot of people out there, a lot of artists, a lot of creative people, that are awake.
[01:14:54.536 --> 01:14:56.217]  And I have gotten emails about that game.
[01:14:56.237 --> 01:14:58.479]  That's supposedly a pretty popular game, too.
[01:14:58.919 --> 01:15:00.200]  I owned it.
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:04.803]  I mean, it's pretty fun, considering all you do is kill hundreds of Russians the entire time.
[01:15:05.063 --> 01:15:05.864]  But at the same time,
[01:15:06.916 --> 01:15:10.339]  I played the game and I go, oh my god, they mention Alex Jones movies in this game.
[01:15:10.359 --> 01:15:10.820]  That's great!
[01:15:12.121 --> 01:15:13.422]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:15:14.002 --> 01:15:14.663]  I really do.
[01:15:14.863 --> 01:15:18.066]  I think I got contacted by them and they even asked permission if they could.
[01:15:18.426 --> 01:15:23.090]  You don't have to ask permission to plug one of my films in your film or your book.
[01:15:23.591 --> 01:15:26.713]  People send me emails saying, can I link or post one of your stories without permission?
[01:15:26.973 --> 01:15:27.614]  You got it!
[01:15:27.794 --> 01:15:28.755]  You got it, folks!
[01:15:29.616 --> 01:15:31.417]  I'm just trying to survive at this point.
[01:15:32.298 --> 01:15:33.359]  I just want to get the word out.
[01:15:34.102 --> 01:15:37.104]  I mean, I discovered the whole world's run by psychopathic killers.
[01:15:37.524 --> 01:15:38.965]  Much doesn't matter after that.
[01:15:39.846 --> 01:15:44.608]  That's why I watch patriot groups fighting with each other and ninnying and all of it.
[01:15:44.628 --> 01:15:46.890]  I'm just like, man, you guys don't even know what you're into.
[01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:49.311]  I mean, this is not a joke.
[01:15:49.331 --> 01:15:50.132]  This is not a game.
[01:15:50.152 --> 01:15:51.252]  This is the New World Order.
[01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:52.893]  And they're coming down on us.
[01:15:53.394 --> 01:15:55.115]  Roman in California, you're on the air.
[01:15:55.175 --> 01:15:55.795]  Thanks for holding.
[01:15:57.036 --> 01:16:00.378]  Yeah, I'd just like to elaborate on what I said yesterday.
[01:16:00.911 --> 01:16:07.236]  I'd like to know where Disney is getting the towel paper for the domestic sweatshops and the foreign sweatshops.
[01:16:07.356 --> 01:16:10.498]  Okay, let me just stop you, sir, because here's the deal.
[01:16:11.339 --> 01:16:12.379]  I'm not censoring you.
[01:16:12.419 --> 01:16:13.860]  We don't screen your call when you call in.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.041]  You sound like a nice fella.
[01:16:15.702 --> 01:16:26.309]  The problem is that you said, whenever you called the show, I guess it was yesterday, Roman, you said, let me go back to exactly what you said.
[01:16:27.954 --> 01:16:33.297]  Disney is involved in... Did you say child kidnapping?
[01:16:33.317 --> 01:16:34.358]  What was it you said specifically?
[01:16:34.598 --> 01:16:39.121]  I said that Disney may be involved with Dimecore's child kidnapping rings.
[01:16:39.221 --> 01:16:44.064]  And I say that because a lot of Disney's top brass are pedophiles.
[01:16:44.464 --> 01:16:46.425]  And they don't run background checks on hired people.
[01:16:46.445 --> 01:16:47.546]  And how do you know that?
[01:16:47.606 --> 01:16:48.266]  How do you know that?
[01:16:49.007 --> 01:16:50.167]  Because it's on the internet.
[01:16:50.227 --> 01:16:50.828]  I've seen it.
[01:16:51.888 --> 01:16:54.410]  How do you know Disney doesn't run background checks?
[01:16:55.006 --> 01:16:57.808]  Because it's been reported on in the news.
[01:16:58.529 --> 01:17:02.753]  Well, and listen, I asked you yesterday to email me proof or to write it up.
[01:17:03.513 --> 01:17:05.615]  Okay, and listen, I appreciate your call, Roman.
[01:17:05.655 --> 01:17:06.236]  Listen, man.
[01:17:07.217 --> 01:17:08.558]  Okay, I let you on air.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:11.861]  And I let you say that again.
[01:17:12.721 --> 01:17:14.843]  But I'm asking you for some proof, okay?
[01:17:14.943 --> 01:17:17.045]  I mean, I know Disney's a New World Order company.
[01:17:18.026 --> 01:17:19.927]  I know Disney is really bad news.
[01:17:21.088 --> 01:17:22.810]  And we make no bones about that.
[01:17:23.536 --> 01:17:27.460]  But just to say, I saw it on the internet, I want to see the proof.
[01:17:28.682 --> 01:17:41.255]  And you know, it was a couple of weeks ago, I got a caller called in and said, have you heard about this thing with giant put options for late September, by September 20th, and how the economy's going to crash, and how it's record put options, they're calling it Bin Laden trades.
[01:17:41.275 --> 01:17:41.815]  And I said, no.
[01:17:41.855 --> 01:17:42.796]  I said, can you give me a source?
[01:17:43.397 --> 01:17:44.778]  And he said, no, I can't right now.
[01:17:44.798 --> 01:17:45.499]  And I said, well, thank you.
[01:17:45.539 --> 01:17:46.220]  I'll check into that.
[01:17:46.917 --> 01:17:49.419]  And I got criticized for hanging up on him and saying, I'll check into it.
[01:17:49.679 --> 01:17:52.061]  And I did check into it, and it was true.
[01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:55.023]  And we wrote articles about it and covered it.
[01:17:55.043 --> 01:17:58.025]  People said, oh, you scoffed at that caller.
[01:17:59.165 --> 01:18:00.366]  No, I'm not scoffing.
[01:18:00.386 --> 01:18:09.653]  I mean, if somebody calls in and says something about Disney like that, I've got to cut them off, folks, or I'm liable if there's not proof.
[01:18:11.314 --> 01:18:11.654]  You see?
[01:18:12.814 --> 01:18:17.078]  And so, Roman, that's the last time you can call in about that subject until I get some proof.
[01:18:17.758 --> 01:18:21.381]  I mean, I want to hear dates, I want to hear names, I want to hear, you know, the facts.
[01:18:21.441 --> 01:18:35.772]  I mean, frankly, 1.2 million children, last time I saw a United Nations report on it just out of Central Europe, 1.2 million women and children kidnapped, and that was in 2002 alone?
[01:18:35.792 --> 01:18:37.814]  And I'm supposed that it's growing?
[01:18:38.335 --> 01:18:39.856]  That's industrial, that's big!
[01:18:41.263 --> 01:18:43.447]  I have no doubt big institutions are involved.
[01:18:43.507 --> 01:18:44.128]  I know they are.
[01:18:44.188 --> 01:18:46.693]  I don't know about specifically, though, what you said about that.
[01:18:47.194 --> 01:18:48.135]  I know about DynCorp.
[01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:50.480]  Okay, that's all I'm saying.
[01:18:55.365 --> 01:18:59.869]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:19:00.209 --> 01:19:04.313]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:19:04.593 --> 01:19:05.153]  We listened.
[01:19:05.454 --> 01:19:10.438]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:19:10.718 --> 01:19:11.199]  We listened.
[01:19:11.579 --> 01:19:14.621]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:15.582]  We listened.
[01:19:16.043 --> 01:19:19.886]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:19:19.926 --> 01:19:20.606]  We're good.
[01:19:36.474 --> 01:19:39.096]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[01:19:39.297 --> 01:19:39.497]  Only $279.
[01:19:39.557 --> 01:19:40.137]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:40.177 --> 01:19:40.418]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:19:42.159 --> 01:19:43.080]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:52.891 --> 01:19:54.392]  Ten Enters for a light of September 5th, 2007.

[01:19:57.855 --> 01:19:58.236]  That's $702.47, $346.55 and $173.48.
[01:20:07.262 --> 01:20:13.224]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[01:20:13.284 --> 01:20:17.626]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a yon revolution.
[01:20:17.926 --> 01:20:26.389]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[01:20:26.409 --> 01:20:28.990]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[01:20:29.290 --> 01:20:33.152]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[01:20:33.352 --> 01:20:39.775]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[01:20:40.095 --> 01:20:43.597]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:20:43.637 --> 01:20:46.818]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[01:20:46.898 --> 01:20:47.179]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:47.199 --> 01:20:47.379]  That's 800-686-2237.

[01:21:03.296 --> 01:21:10.164]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:21:10.604 --> 01:21:17.288]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:19.230]  There are no reported side effects.

[01:21:41.923 --> 01:21:43.324]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:43.344 --> 01:21:46.665]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:21:59.705 --> 01:22:15.861]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[01:22:16.822 --> 01:22:22.027]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[01:22:22.842 --> 01:22:30.768]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:34.070]  The call is free.
[01:22:34.090 --> 01:22:38.473]  Our operators are standing by to take your order for a year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:53.317 --> 01:22:56.959]  Yee-haw, baby!
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:57.200]  An 1814!
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:03.504]  This song... ...is always dedicated to Paul and Steve Watson.
[01:23:23.277 --> 01:23:23.677]  I'll tell ya.
[01:23:52.408 --> 01:23:58.210]  The United States has such an incredible, illustrious, dynamic, swashbuckling history.
[01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:12.934]  And I'm just sick of ninnying, fake CIA Christians running all the major universities, running around saying it's of the Lord to nuke Iran, and they send them to the straw polls, they send them to the... they're everywhere!
[01:24:13.821 --> 01:24:17.247]  And they all drive big fancy cars and live in big fancy houses.
[01:24:17.267 --> 01:24:18.308]  They're not Christians.
[01:24:18.929 --> 01:24:22.294]  Most of them are, you know, in the men's bathroom, like the Senator.
[01:24:22.314 --> 01:24:27.141]  And it's a weird, sick cult of fake Christian
[01:24:29.076 --> 01:24:32.838]  And, look, I'm not even bashing gay people out there, folks.
[01:24:32.858 --> 01:24:36.959]  I think it's a dangerous lifestyle, destructive lifestyle, but I don't hate you individually.
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:38.980]  I'm not saying you're a bad person.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.121]  We all do bad things.
[01:24:41.221 --> 01:24:44.162]  Every time I bash Larry Craig, I get these emails, what you're being mean to gay people.
[01:24:44.422 --> 01:24:50.185]  No, I'm saying this is a fake, ninnying, fake, conservative, pervert, and disgusting bathroom!
[01:24:52.306 --> 01:24:53.346]  It's disgusting!
[01:24:54.067 --> 01:24:57.208]  If it was a man with a woman in the bathroom, it'd be gross.
[01:24:58.214 --> 01:24:59.935]  I'm not here to hate on people, folks.
[01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:01.976]  I'm just here to say I'm sick of it!
[01:25:04.418 --> 01:25:06.419]  And I didn't look for this information.
[01:25:06.479 --> 01:25:08.280]  I didn't know the global elite wanted to kill us.
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:10.261]  That's the information I keep finding!
[01:25:12.037 --> 01:25:19.742]  I remember hearing 15 years ago, when I first got into this stuff, that it was a bunch of pedophiles that ran things, and sure enough, every time we research, it's true!
[01:25:19.842 --> 01:25:21.143]  I can't believe that either!
[01:25:21.383 --> 01:25:22.844]  I mean, it's out of control!
[01:25:23.284 --> 01:25:28.788]  We got a bunch of wicked devils running things, running around, ninnying, saying they're Christians!
[01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:33.051]  And frankly, I'm tired of them!
[01:25:36.893 --> 01:25:37.914]  I'm tired of them!
[01:25:38.234 --> 01:25:39.155]  I'm sick of them!
[01:25:41.107 --> 01:25:43.389]  I don't know why they claim they're right-wing Christians.
[01:25:43.429 --> 01:25:49.393]  I don't know why almost all of them are homosexual, and then it gets even more serious from that point on.
[01:25:50.173 --> 01:25:51.054]  They're liars.
[01:25:51.094 --> 01:25:52.175]  They're into deception.
[01:25:52.315 --> 01:25:53.395]  I don't understand it.
[01:25:54.836 --> 01:25:57.038]  I don't know why they like to just kill innocent people.
[01:25:57.338 --> 01:26:03.262]  I don't know why Richard Perle walks around at cocktail parties bragging about how he orders the death of people to women to show off.
[01:26:03.322 --> 01:26:05.103]  I mean, these are sick freaks, man!
[01:26:06.264 --> 01:26:07.165]  Look at Richard Perle.
[01:26:07.205 --> 01:26:09.126]  He's a big, fat, soft, weak,
[01:26:09.873 --> 01:26:13.656]  Doughy white skin, big giant white circles around his eyes.
[01:26:14.877 --> 01:26:17.479]  And Lord knows I got black circles and I'm chubby too, but you know what I mean.
[01:26:17.519 --> 01:26:20.101]  He's like a... At least you can tell I used to be strong.
[01:26:20.161 --> 01:26:25.125]  I used to be... I mean, this guy, it's like he's just a big, weak ball of blubber.
[01:26:28.188 --> 01:26:29.969]  There's just something wrong with it, man!
[01:26:29.989 --> 01:26:34.052]  A bunch of ninnying, chicken-necked weaklings rule over us!
[01:26:36.594 --> 01:26:37.515]  I'm really ranting now.
[01:26:37.595 --> 01:26:38.656]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:26:43.519 --> 01:26:47.882]  I know we've got Thomas and Cliff and we're going to get to you.
[01:26:47.942 --> 01:26:57.509]  I give each caller quite a bit of time because they're all bringing up important issues and our guest is going to be on Christina Ebersole right now instead of next hour.
[01:26:57.569 --> 01:27:02.473]  So after she's gone after a segment, we open the phone for us to show and all that news I was mentioning.
[01:27:04.574 --> 01:27:06.976]  Before I end this segment, we've got a new sponsor.
[01:27:07.885 --> 01:27:09.726]  It's the RonPaulDollar.net.
[01:27:09.786 --> 01:27:11.827]  RonPaulDollar.net.
[01:27:12.407 --> 01:27:13.648]  RonPaulDollar.net.
[01:27:13.668 --> 01:27:19.450]  You've seen those beautiful Ron Paul dollars in bronze and silver and in gold.
[01:27:19.691 --> 01:27:20.851]  Talk about collector's item.
[01:27:22.072 --> 01:27:23.872]  I have ordered one for myself.
[01:27:24.353 --> 01:27:25.573]  Just ordered it this weekend.
[01:27:26.334 --> 01:27:27.314]  Eagerly awaiting it.
[01:27:28.755 --> 01:27:30.776]  And it's just amazing stuff.
[01:27:33.137 --> 01:27:35.798]  And you can get a silver or bronze or gold.
[01:27:37.597 --> 01:27:41.298]  Ron Paul Dollar!
[01:27:41.318 --> 01:27:53.180]  888-421-6181 or 888-LIB-DOLLAR, 888-LIB-DOLLAR, 888-421-6181, RonPaulDollar.net.
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:54.980]  Beautiful double stamped coins.
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:28:02.222]  The guy that runs this, he's been running it for many years, is the guy that ran the big mint, big commemorative mint they have in Hawaii.
[01:28:02.942 --> 01:28:03.902]  Really interesting fella.
[01:28:06.747 --> 01:28:08.929]  Talking with the governor over there about starting their own currency.
[01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:10.310]  I mean, it's the real deal.
[01:28:11.171 --> 01:28:15.115]  So just check it all out and all the great products they've got at RonPaulDollar.net.
[01:28:15.435 --> 01:28:20.320]  That's a specific site that takes you right to all the Ron Paul goodies.
[01:28:21.621 --> 01:28:24.523]  RonPaulDollar.net.
[01:28:24.543 --> 01:28:25.384]  888-421-6181.
[01:28:26.065 --> 01:28:30.409]  Alright, we'll be right back with Christina Ebersole via cell phone from Manhattan.
[01:28:31.425 --> 01:28:32.926]  Then your calls and a ton of news.
[01:28:32.946 --> 01:28:34.087]  Stay with me.
[01:28:43.716 --> 01:28:44.617]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.117 --> 01:28:46.718]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.639 --> 01:28:50.342]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.182 --> 01:28:56.104]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[01:28:56.564 --> 01:28:58.306]  Look, up there in the sky.
[01:28:58.726 --> 01:29:00.047]  It's Non-X-Man.
[01:29:00.427 --> 01:29:01.588]  He's in a dive.
[01:29:01.869 --> 01:29:03.870]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[01:29:04.171 --> 01:29:04.951]  Let's go look.
[01:29:07.173 --> 01:29:10.356]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[01:29:10.776 --> 01:29:12.097]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[01:29:12.317 --> 01:29:12.738]  Take them out.
[01:29:13.368 --> 01:29:14.049]  Let's see.
[01:29:14.069 --> 01:29:18.652]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[01:29:19.012 --> 01:29:19.472]  Don't worry.
[01:29:19.933 --> 01:29:21.434]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:29:22.074 --> 01:29:26.478]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[01:29:27.018 --> 01:29:29.079]  Oh, I will, Non-X Man.
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:31.922]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[01:29:34.042 --> 01:29:36.683]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[01:29:37.163 --> 01:29:40.644]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[01:29:41.165 --> 01:29:52.288]  It's in the foot care aisle at Super Setters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[01:29:53.334 --> 01:29:57.916]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:29:58.316 --> 01:30:01.257]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:30:01.577 --> 01:30:04.138]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:30:04.498 --> 01:30:09.320]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:30:09.701 --> 01:30:15.063]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:30:15.363 --> 01:30:18.324]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[01:30:18.524 --> 01:30:19.084]  We're good to go.
[01:30:41.915 --> 01:30:42.176]  Hey, Emily!
[01:30:42.196 --> 01:30:42.717]  Wow, you look great!
[01:30:56.087 --> 01:30:56.887]  I feel great.
[01:30:57.128 --> 01:30:59.008]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:30:59.429 --> 01:30:59.749]  Really?
[01:30:59.849 --> 01:31:00.389]  What is it?
[01:31:00.509 --> 01:31:00.969]  How does it work?
[01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:08.053]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[01:31:08.373 --> 01:31:10.634]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:31:11.014 --> 01:31:16.137]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:31:16.657 --> 01:31:17.118]  That's it?
[01:31:17.358 --> 01:31:18.959]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:31:19.259 --> 01:31:19.960]  It is easy.
[01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:26.905]  Plus, the FDA says Flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:31:27.185 --> 01:31:28.526]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:31:28.726 --> 01:31:29.507]  That's amazing!
[01:31:29.827 --> 01:31:35.191]  And, the Benzonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:31:35.452 --> 01:31:35.752]  Wow!
[01:31:35.932 --> 01:31:37.013]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[01:31:37.453 --> 01:31:40.456]  A one-month supply is available online at menacleans.com.
[01:31:40.556 --> 01:31:44.419]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:45.020]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:45.260]  That's 800-317-9547.
[01:31:56.178 --> 01:31:59.600]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:04.303]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[01:32:05.224 --> 01:32:08.646]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[01:32:09.026 --> 01:32:17.251]  And when you're out there, was out there, yeah I was out of touch.
[01:32:17.512 --> 01:32:21.474]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[01:32:24.446 --> 01:32:26.867]  Welcome back my friends.
[01:32:27.147 --> 01:32:29.788]  You know one of the best parts about my job
[01:32:51.844 --> 01:32:57.227]  Is that I get to meet people who have incredible passion, love of liberty, and courage.
[01:32:57.527 --> 01:32:59.768]  And one of those individuals is Christine Ebersole.
[01:33:00.748 --> 01:33:09.753]  Last year, she went public for 9-11 Truth on John Connor's radio show right here on the GCN Radio Network, and then really hadn't made any other media appearances dealing with 9-11 Truth.
[01:33:09.773 --> 01:33:12.594]  She got some heat, but rebounded from that well.
[01:33:12.614 --> 01:33:15.996]  It got international, and of course national, attention.
[01:33:16.856 --> 01:33:17.877]  She is a two-time
[01:33:18.692 --> 01:33:22.374]  Tony award-winning American actress and singer.
[01:33:23.035 --> 01:33:25.976]  And she's won a bunch of other awards.
[01:33:26.016 --> 01:33:30.839]  She's had some of the top shows on Broadway, TV, movies, it goes on and on.
[01:33:30.859 --> 01:33:39.605]  Of course, she was a frequent guest on The View with Rosie O'Donnell, was the first to start broaching and getting the ball rolling on 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:33:39.625 --> 01:33:42.046]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:33:42.066 --> 01:33:46.569]  And so she joins us until the end of this hour and she's going to be singing
[01:33:47.209 --> 01:33:54.416]  At a benefit for the first responders, firemen and police and their families Sunday at the same event where we're going to be premiering Endgame.
[01:33:54.816 --> 01:33:57.959]  And so I just salute her for her courage.
[01:33:58.479 --> 01:34:09.129]  I mean to be one of the first and she was the first prominent woman in the entertainment community and put a lot on the line to go public and she did it in a bold way coming right out with Inside Job.
[01:34:09.949 --> 01:34:12.051]  Christine Ebersole, I really appreciate you coming on.
[01:34:12.071 --> 01:34:13.753]  Thanks for having me Alex.
[01:34:15.505 --> 01:34:18.226]  Again, I mean that when I say it, the courage.
[01:34:18.446 --> 01:34:20.868]  Why did you finally just decide to go public?
[01:34:20.908 --> 01:34:26.131]  What made you reach out and really kick off that giant controversy on The View?
[01:34:26.151 --> 01:34:32.235]  Well, I think it was sort of a convergence of things, Alex.
[01:34:33.055 --> 01:34:43.622]  I was doing a show on Broadway at the time called Grey Gardens, and I think some of the themes of that show were about oppression,
[01:34:44.970 --> 01:35:04.865]  And patriarchal rule and a sort of a silencing and a very prominent role that women played back in that society was to just pretty much be a prop to capitulate to the status quo and to promote the status quo.
[01:35:06.286 --> 01:35:08.407]  And also, I've
[01:35:09.758 --> 01:35:12.520]  I don't really consider myself a religious person.
[01:35:12.580 --> 01:35:14.822]  I consider myself to be a spiritual person.
[01:35:15.963 --> 01:35:23.588]  And my entire life I've been very much a fan of Martin Luther King and his work.
[01:35:24.809 --> 01:35:26.991]  And the work that he tried to do while he was on Earth.
[01:35:28.071 --> 01:35:34.056]  And pretty much it was those kind of convergence of things where I really truly agonized over it.
[01:35:34.136 --> 01:35:38.199]  Because, you know, you sort of stand on a precipice.
[01:35:39.136 --> 01:35:42.117]  Of silence and action.
[01:35:43.438 --> 01:35:47.940]  And I never really considered myself a star.
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:56.043]  And here, I was just wanting to sort of speak the truth about what I saw.
[01:35:56.883 --> 01:36:05.987]  And really, it was based on the official government story that wasn't supported by the laws of the universe.
[01:36:06.527 --> 01:36:07.928]  And it was really that simple.
[01:36:09.398 --> 01:36:17.100]  And how justice, Martin Luther King tells us that justice, the universe bends towards justice.
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:22.402]  So we have the support of the universe in being able to give us clues about what is truth.
[01:36:23.542 --> 01:36:33.485]  And I felt that the official government story just denied all of the laws of the universe.
[01:36:33.565 --> 01:36:37.246]  It's sort of like out of George Orwell's 1984 where George Orwell says,
[01:36:37.785 --> 01:36:42.567]  Freedom is the freedom to say that 2 plus 2 is 4.
[01:36:44.028 --> 01:37:03.958]  And if you say on national television that steel burns at 15... at 2,500 degrees and fire burns at 1,500 degrees and if they say a building comes down in less than 45 minutes
[01:37:05.746 --> 01:37:16.195]  in 11 seconds on its own footprint with the 47 core columns that it was designed for a 727 to hit it.
[01:37:18.757 --> 01:37:21.239]  And they're telling you that this happened.
[01:37:21.479 --> 01:37:30.366]  I mean, it's like if I said to you, Alex, hey, did you know that I can run from New Jersey where I live to Texas in two hours?
[01:37:31.567 --> 01:37:32.368]  You're going to say to me,
[01:37:33.559 --> 01:37:35.522]  It's not, that's not possible.
[01:37:35.622 --> 01:37:42.811]  Well I've seen Fox News and John Gibson say that steel does burn at 1500 degrees.
[01:37:42.891 --> 01:37:43.913]  Now that's not true.
[01:37:43.933 --> 01:37:46.336]  It doesn't even start melting until...
[01:37:47.281 --> 01:37:47.541]  Uh huh.
[01:37:47.581 --> 01:37:47.661]  Yeah.
[01:38:16.556 --> 01:38:25.178]  And I think that sometimes, really, people become fearful and they don't want to have to think for themselves.
[01:38:26.098 --> 01:38:32.719]  I think because out of fear, out of fear of knowing what the truth is and what that means about yourself.
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:39.581]  What does it mean to know the truth about something and that the government can tell you a story that isn't true
[01:38:40.393 --> 01:38:46.755]  And you have the right, as a human being, to question that, don't you?
[01:38:47.556 --> 01:38:49.937]  See, people, I think, are afraid.
[01:38:50.017 --> 01:38:54.218]  What does it mean if I discover that the government is lying to me?
[01:38:55.579 --> 01:38:57.239]  What do I do with that information?
[01:38:57.519 --> 01:39:04.282]  Now, Christine, going back to four, five, six months ago, when the whole Rosie controversy was going on with The View,
[01:39:05.362 --> 01:39:05.502]  Yeah.
[01:39:05.922 --> 01:39:17.808]  I mean, before I ever talked to you on the phone, before I ever got emails from Rosie and people, before I ever found out what people were really thinking, I did surmise correctly that Rosie knew all about it.
[01:39:18.168 --> 01:39:19.509]  Sure enough, she'd seen Lou Shane.
[01:39:19.529 --> 01:39:21.710]  She'd woken up seeing Terror Storm last September.
[01:39:22.290 --> 01:39:24.151]  People like you and others had given it to her.
[01:39:26.127 --> 01:39:35.030]  I mean, when she imitated John Connor and said, 9-11's an inside job, 9-11's an inside job, I said, that's her way of getting it out there but doing it in somebody else's name.
[01:39:35.731 --> 01:39:46.575]  Am I right in saying that it was you coming out on the show and then Roland and others that triggered that debate and that discussion that then led to Rosie going public?
[01:39:49.842 --> 01:39:56.166]  Again, I think it was kind of like a convergence at that moment, Alex.
[01:39:56.746 --> 01:40:14.479]  I was asked to come on and host the show, and there was this meeting that you have at the very beginning called Hot Topics, and it was an idea that I had because, again, it came out of the show I was in, Grey Gardens.
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:18.302]  Edie Beal, who was the character that I played, was
[01:40:18.945 --> 01:40:22.926]  You know, with a lover of fashion and a lover of politics.
[01:40:22.946 --> 01:40:24.327]  She was mad about politics.
[01:40:25.167 --> 01:40:32.549]  So, in this sense, I was trying to just show how that character influenced me.
[01:40:33.389 --> 01:40:34.490]  And... Well, you can see that.
[01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:40.192]  These aren't women doing what they're supposed to do in the corporate, controlled, Borg world of Madison Avenue.
[01:40:40.492 --> 01:40:42.692]  Ninny around, only be into how you look.
[01:40:42.932 --> 01:40:46.834]  You were saying, no, women should be really informed and dynamic and have courage.
[01:40:47.054 --> 01:40:48.054]  And my gosh, you did that!
[01:40:49.477 --> 01:40:56.362]  Well, I think, to tell you the honest truth, I had innocence and naivete on my side.
[01:40:57.143 --> 01:41:11.332]  Because I think if you... It's a pool of sharks out there, and if you dare to stand up and speak the truth the way you see it, and question authority, you're going to be called crazy.
[01:41:11.432 --> 01:41:13.874]  I mean, Martin Luther King said the very same thing.
[01:41:14.354 --> 01:41:15.615]  They're going to try to take you down.
[01:41:17.603 --> 01:41:20.530]  Because, uh, the truth actually...
[01:41:21.121 --> 01:41:24.443]  is more powerful than any nuclear weapon.
[01:41:24.583 --> 01:41:25.043]  Oh, you're right.
[01:41:25.063 --> 01:41:28.705]  It's the most powerful weapon that a human being can have.
[01:41:28.945 --> 01:41:29.606]  Christine, you're right.
[01:41:29.626 --> 01:41:33.088]  They're scared to death of truth-tellers, and it's like what Gandhi stated.
[01:41:33.608 --> 01:41:37.550]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:47.316]  And we're now up to the attacking point, and the more they attack, and the more disinfo pieces they put out by Hearst Publishing and History Channel, the more the polls show the people are awake.
[01:41:47.396 --> 01:41:49.577]  It isn't working anymore.
[01:41:50.177 --> 01:41:52.699]  The fraud of the war isn't selling anymore?
[01:41:53.039 --> 01:41:55.020]  The fraud of the police state isn't selling anymore?
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:42:07.327]  Where do you see that going in the future now that it seems like there is not just a convergence on the view, but a convergence out here in the real world as more and more people begin to realize they've been lied to?
[01:42:09.648 --> 01:42:15.771]  Well, I think what happens is when people become aware of
[01:42:17.481 --> 01:42:22.862]  of what the truth is, then it means that we have to take responsibility.
[01:42:23.382 --> 01:42:26.283]  There is a responsibility in knowing the truth.
[01:42:26.903 --> 01:42:38.766]  It's very easy not to know it, and to sort of rely on authorities to sort of take care of you, almost like a benevolent father in a sense, you know, so that you don't really have to think for yourself.
[01:42:39.866 --> 01:42:44.227]  But I think it's really a matter of the salvation of the Republic.
[01:42:44.967 --> 01:42:45.908]  If we
[01:42:48.516 --> 01:42:55.979]  No, if there's a collective group of people that know, and it's growing, the numbers are growing by the minute.
[01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:06.163]  I think that that's really our only chance to save our republic, really.
[01:43:07.864 --> 01:43:16.147]  I don't know in what form how it's going to happen, but I think it's really a spiritual call, really.
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:19.941]  To do what is right.
[01:43:20.001 --> 01:43:21.241]  To do the right thing.
[01:43:21.601 --> 01:43:23.602]  And not to be afraid.
[01:43:23.682 --> 01:43:24.763]  That's really what it is.
[01:43:24.903 --> 01:43:27.204]  It's about giving people hope.
[01:43:29.185 --> 01:43:30.806]  That they can know the truth.
[01:43:31.766 --> 01:43:33.808]  And that it's okay.
[01:43:33.828 --> 01:43:42.712]  So that there's not this confusion and depression and this crazy acting out that happens.
[01:43:43.582 --> 01:43:57.852]  Uh, when people are aware of the truth but are afraid to say it, or they're not even, they don't want to really explore it, they don't want to really pursue it, uh, because of what it might, the responsibility that you might have to take, uh, for knowing it.
[01:43:58.493 --> 01:44:01.495]  But I think it's really our only hope.
[01:44:02.637 --> 01:44:12.732]  And so I guess that's really why I feel, you know, what Martin Luther King said, to stand for the truth of God is the most important thing a person can do.
[01:44:12.952 --> 01:44:18.260]  Well, if good people take the field against corruption and evil, it's not going to prevail.
[01:44:19.341 --> 01:44:19.901]  We're good to go.
[01:44:36.508 --> 01:44:40.409]  You were also very helpful to me Alex when you left a message for me on my cell phone.
[01:44:58.676 --> 01:45:02.078]  After that whole thing about the National Enquirer and all that.
[01:45:02.218 --> 01:45:03.338]  I was so scared.
[01:45:03.858 --> 01:45:09.541]  And you were so helpful to me, leaving that message for me on my cell phone.
[01:45:09.561 --> 01:45:11.121]  I don't know if you remember what you said.
[01:45:12.782 --> 01:45:18.205]  I remember I was driving with my family to visit some other family across the state.
[01:45:18.245 --> 01:45:21.986]  And I think I just said that... I don't remember what I said.
[01:45:22.006 --> 01:45:22.446]  What did I say?
[01:45:22.626 --> 01:45:25.568]  Well, you said that you're halfway across the river.
[01:45:26.627 --> 01:45:29.051]  You know, you just need to keep going forward.
[01:45:29.071 --> 01:45:32.277]  There's no retreating, which is true.
[01:45:32.357 --> 01:45:34.160]  I mean, once you, you can't...
[01:45:34.818 --> 01:45:39.500]  Can't go back inside the closet once you're out, in terms of that.
[01:45:40.781 --> 01:45:43.562]  But it just, it made me feel that I wasn't alone.
[01:45:44.563 --> 01:45:51.826]  Well, they've done things like lie on Fox News and say that Charlie doesn't believe in 9-11 truth anymore, and he had to put a statement out saying that's completely made up.
[01:45:51.887 --> 01:45:53.988]  I mean, they want Oscar recant.
[01:45:54.068 --> 01:45:56.609]  They want, I mean, they create false
[01:45:57.049 --> 01:45:57.730]  No, I don't think so.
[01:46:13.456 --> 01:46:21.204]  So that's what John Gibson and Bill O'Reilly do is all the time they try to claim that people have backed off 9-11 truth now.
[01:46:21.444 --> 01:46:22.445]  It's all been defeated.
[01:46:22.786 --> 01:46:29.413]  And I just bring up the Mark Twain quote of rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[01:46:31.355 --> 01:46:45.861]  My point was, they're attacking you now, and if you back off, if you give in to them, then they'll only dance on your grave, but you're with the truth, you've done the right thing, and so feel good about what you've done, because that's what they feed off of, is the fear.
[01:46:46.101 --> 01:46:57.725]  If they think they can get to you, and they also want to make you and others an example to then scare others from going public, not just with 9-11 truth, but the war, and a thousand other issues.
[01:46:58.405 --> 01:46:58.706]  Uh-huh.
[01:46:58.726 --> 01:46:59.646]  Yeah.
[01:47:00.586 --> 01:47:09.252]  And you know, I have a right to question, you know, those that say that 2 plus 2 isn't 4.
[01:47:09.292 --> 01:47:11.334]  Absolutely!
[01:47:11.354 --> 01:47:13.435]  Because I have the support of the universe!
[01:47:13.515 --> 01:47:17.598]  The universe tells me that 2 plus 2 is 4, and I have the freedom to say that!
[01:47:18.899 --> 01:47:21.941]  Well, it's also true that... I'm here to tell you that 2 plus 2 is 4!
[01:47:23.978 --> 01:47:24.979]  Well, you go, Winston.
[01:47:24.999 --> 01:47:25.920]  We're going to win in the end.
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:27.521]  And we are.
[01:47:27.841 --> 01:47:28.982]  Winston's in this fight.
[01:47:29.162 --> 01:47:32.224]  And if it continues, we are going to get into a 1984 situation.
[01:47:32.464 --> 01:47:34.686]  But the good news is we're not just putting a pretty face on this.
[01:47:35.026 --> 01:47:35.566]  It's true.
[01:47:35.586 --> 01:47:38.969]  I'm not just being a, you know, pep rally cheerleader here.
[01:47:39.029 --> 01:47:39.569]  It's true.
[01:47:39.749 --> 01:47:41.651]  We really are gaining ground.
[01:47:41.691 --> 01:47:48.516]  I mean, 80 plus percent of Americans now against the war, 75 percent of the troops, up 5 percent from just last year against the war.
[01:47:48.956 --> 01:47:53.319]  And on every other issue, what the establishment is doing is unpopular, Christine.
[01:47:53.951 --> 01:47:54.492]  I know that.
[01:47:54.732 --> 01:47:55.092]  Yeah.
[01:47:55.673 --> 01:47:56.153]  I know that.
[01:47:56.613 --> 01:47:58.695]  It's really about finding a voice.
[01:47:59.636 --> 01:48:04.621]  Finding a voice and not being afraid to stand up for what is true and what is right.
[01:48:04.921 --> 01:48:10.386]  Well, the trick is, if you don't stand up against evil, and I've experienced this in life and studying history, if you
[01:48:11.207 --> 01:48:11.587]  Well, that's right.
[01:48:11.607 --> 01:48:14.449]  What does it say in the Bible that which I have feared has come upon me?
[01:48:14.469 --> 01:48:15.189]  I think that's
[01:48:40.323 --> 01:48:46.247]  It's easier said than done, but we choose to live by faith or we choose to live by fear.
[01:48:46.847 --> 01:48:56.573]  And, you know, if faith is born in love and how God created all of us, then the perfect love casts out fear.
[01:48:56.913 --> 01:49:01.836]  What was it like when you took the plunge and came out and said 9-11 is an inside job?
[01:49:02.016 --> 01:49:04.578]  What did it feel like when you were getting ready to finally take the plunge?
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:27.613]  Well, I just remember there was, you know, like I said, I had agonized over that because it was either stand still or move forward in my commitment to my faith, my faith in God.
[01:49:28.794 --> 01:49:37.201]  And I guess, you know, I felt good about it.
[01:49:37.221 --> 01:49:38.081]  I mean, I felt
[01:49:39.173 --> 01:49:41.455]  I mean, I don't regret anything I've done.
[01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:49.541]  Yet, at the same time, when it all happened, I was, like I said, I was very scared.
[01:49:49.681 --> 01:49:50.122]  Stay there.
[01:49:50.182 --> 01:49:50.582]  Stay there.
[01:49:50.602 --> 01:49:51.203]  We've got a break.
[01:49:51.243 --> 01:49:52.684]  Final segment with Christine Ebersole.
[01:49:56.781 --> 01:49:57.262]  It's here!
[01:49:57.482 --> 01:50:02.271]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.632 --> 01:50:10.265]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.959 --> 01:50:18.002]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.422 --> 01:50:29.847]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.147 --> 01:50:33.649]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.109 --> 01:50:36.050]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.370 --> 01:50:40.152]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.693 --> 01:50:58.915]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:59.055 --> 01:51:07.157]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.397 --> 01:51:14.459]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.639 --> 01:51:15.919]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:15.999 --> 01:51:21.900]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:27.181]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.281 --> 01:51:36.163]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.423 --> 01:51:39.724]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:51:41.824 --> 01:51:42.165]  We're good.
[01:51:53.143 --> 01:51:57.904]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:51:58.145 --> 01:52:02.126]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:52:02.386 --> 01:52:08.688]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:52:08.928 --> 01:52:13.309]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.

[01:52:57.595 --> 01:53:01.736]  Alright, it's our final segment with Christine Ebersole, the two-time Tony Award winner.
[01:53:01.756 --> 01:53:05.037]  I was just talking to her during the break, and she was talking about the pressure she got.
[01:53:05.057 --> 01:53:09.118]  They were telling her, you'll never get the Tony now, your second Tony, and she did win it.
[01:53:10.732 --> 01:53:18.556]  And she's also going to tell a story about right after she knew the Enquirer was coming out with her on the cover attacking her, a talk she had with somebody.
[01:53:18.716 --> 01:53:24.559]  And I haven't heard this story, so can you briefly, in the time we have left, Christine, tell us both those stories?
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:37.866]  Well, the story that happened after I found out that I was going to be in the National Enquirer, I had decided to take a few days off of work and go up to a spa in Pennsylvania with my husband.
[01:53:39.298 --> 01:53:47.743]  I hired a car to take us up there and I was sort of sitting in a fetal position in the backseat thinking, oh my God, my life's over.
[01:53:48.063 --> 01:53:48.903]  I was so scared.
[01:53:48.923 --> 01:53:55.827]  I was just scared out of my mind because this had never happened to me before and I'd never considered myself to be, you know, a celebrity.
[01:53:55.887 --> 01:53:57.948]  So I was surprised to get that kind of attention.
[01:53:58.688 --> 01:54:03.531]  So I was in the backseat of the car and the driver all of a sudden starts
[01:54:04.429 --> 01:54:12.731]  Talking about 9-11, he said, well the reason why I'm driving this car is I had a business at the World Trade Center and I lost that business on 9-11.
[01:54:12.831 --> 01:54:16.751]  He said, I had an import-export business and it was at the World Trade Center.
[01:54:16.791 --> 01:54:20.772]  I said, where were you on 9-11?
[01:54:20.812 --> 01:54:24.033]  He said, I was in the lobby of the World Trade Center.
[01:54:25.173 --> 01:54:31.654]  He said, I was in the lobby and I heard, this was before the planes hit apparently,
[01:54:32.378 --> 01:54:35.560]  There was a huge explosion below me, he said.
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:39.382]  I felt an explosion above me and I thought there was an earthquake.
[01:54:39.982 --> 01:54:44.625]  So I tried to run out onto Liberty Avenue and the door was locked.
[01:54:45.205 --> 01:54:48.607]  And I said to the security guard, can you get me out of here?
[01:54:48.687 --> 01:54:49.027]  I got it.
[01:54:49.047 --> 01:54:49.907]  There's an explosion.
[01:54:49.947 --> 01:54:50.888]  I think there was an earthquake.
[01:54:50.908 --> 01:54:54.350]  He said, sir, get back in the elevator and get back upstairs to where you were.
[01:54:54.370 --> 01:54:55.770]  He says, I'm not going back upstairs.
[01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:56.691]  There was an explosion.
[01:54:57.091 --> 01:54:58.032]  I got to get on the street.
[01:54:58.052 --> 01:54:58.492]  He said, sir,
[01:54:58.956 --> 01:54:59.776]  These are my orders.
[01:55:00.117 --> 01:55:02.558]  Get back in the elevator and go back upstairs.
[01:55:02.598 --> 01:55:04.098]  He goes, I never was upstairs.
[01:55:04.418 --> 01:55:05.499]  I'm not going upstairs.
[01:55:05.619 --> 01:55:06.659]  Get me out of here, sir.
[01:55:07.139 --> 01:55:08.180]  I'm telling you one more time.
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:10.101]  This is my order.
[01:55:10.481 --> 01:55:11.701]  You must get back in the elevator.
[01:55:11.721 --> 01:55:13.122]  He said, well, there's another guy with me.
[01:55:13.182 --> 01:55:14.603]  We punched out the security guard.
[01:55:14.643 --> 01:55:15.603]  We knocked him to the ground.
[01:55:15.923 --> 01:55:17.804]  We jumped over him and we got out the door.
[01:55:17.824 --> 01:55:22.966]  He said, I called the New York Times repeatedly over and over and over again.
[01:55:23.026 --> 01:55:26.167]  I said there was an explosion before the plane hit.
[01:55:26.267 --> 01:55:27.568]  I believe this was the second
[01:55:27.975 --> 01:55:31.518]  By the way, the firemen, the police, William Rodriguez, they all report that.
[01:55:32.118 --> 01:55:32.298]  Yeah.
[01:55:32.878 --> 01:55:35.460]  And he said, I believe it was the first plane that hit, apparently.
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:39.623]  I'm not sure exactly the order, but in other words, the plane had not hit the building.
[01:55:40.304 --> 01:55:42.405]  So these were these explosions that were going on.
[01:55:42.465 --> 01:55:44.326]  He said, I called the New York Times repeatedly.
[01:55:44.366 --> 01:55:45.207]  I sent them emails.
[01:55:45.247 --> 01:55:46.328]  He said they wouldn't respond.
[01:55:46.348 --> 01:55:48.269]  And he said, finally, they responded.
[01:55:48.309 --> 01:55:49.190]  I said, what did they tell you?
[01:55:49.210 --> 01:55:50.951]  He said, they told me I was delusional.
[01:55:51.291 --> 01:55:52.192]  It never happened.
[01:55:53.894 --> 01:55:55.215]  And I said, well, what did you think?
[01:55:55.336 --> 01:56:04.545]  And, you know, he's driving this car, and he sort of bowed his head in shame, almost, not for what he had to say, but for what he understood to be the situation.
[01:56:04.565 --> 01:56:06.807]  He said, it's a cover-up.
[01:56:08.589 --> 01:56:10.451]  Now, he didn't know who you were, though.
[01:56:10.932 --> 01:56:11.272]  No!
[01:56:11.492 --> 01:56:12.853]  He had no idea who I was!
[01:56:13.174 --> 01:56:15.096]  So I just started crying because I knew.
[01:56:15.879 --> 01:56:16.339]  I knew.
[01:56:16.359 --> 01:56:17.861]  This is what happens to us.
[01:56:18.981 --> 01:56:21.023]  It happens to everybody.
[01:56:21.123 --> 01:56:21.944]  Every human being.
[01:56:21.964 --> 01:56:24.786]  It's just a matter of being aware of it.
[01:56:25.262 --> 01:56:35.250]  God sends you, you know, when you stand on purpose, when you stand on truth, God will send you the person to support.
[01:56:35.590 --> 01:56:39.533]  Listen, I was at a little outdoor cafe with Charlie Sheen last year.
[01:56:39.553 --> 01:56:42.936]  He had the idea to have that symposium out there, and he's like, I don't know if I want to do it now.
[01:56:42.956 --> 01:56:46.119]  And I said, hey, do what you want, that's fine, we're out there eating hamburgers.
[01:56:46.759 --> 01:56:53.804]  And just 30 seconds later, a black guy comes walking along out of nowhere and he goes, Alex Jones, Charlie Sheen, I want to thank you both for what you're doing.
[01:56:54.105 --> 01:56:58.828]  You know, you ought to have some type of big event or some type of, you know, thing and you need to keep doing what you're doing.
[01:56:59.128 --> 01:57:00.329]  I mean, it was like an angel.
[01:57:01.090 --> 01:57:01.690]  That's what it is.
[01:57:02.191 --> 01:57:05.233]  They're angels to let us know that we're doing the right thing.
[01:57:05.253 --> 01:57:12.058]  Because the world's going to tell you that you not to, to be quiet and to shut up and not to speak.
[01:57:13.239 --> 01:57:15.781]  But see, this person who didn't know who I was,
[01:57:17.319 --> 01:57:22.422]  But God sent me somebody who was in the epicenter of what was happening.
[01:57:22.662 --> 01:57:23.943]  It's incredible, Christine.
[01:57:24.103 --> 01:57:30.687]  It was a cover-up, and I just started crying, and I said, oh my God, you know, I can't tell you how... Christine, we've got to break.
[01:57:30.707 --> 01:57:31.227]  Stay right there.
[01:57:31.247 --> 01:57:31.887]  We've got to break.
[01:57:33.708 --> 01:57:38.031]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNLive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.674 --> 01:57:50.315]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.996 --> 01:57:52.057]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.758 --> 01:57:53.859]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.519 --> 01:57:55.360]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.101 --> 01:57:56.982]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.643 --> 01:58:01.447]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.847 --> 01:58:05.912]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.764 --> 01:58:08.346]  You're there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:08.606 --> 01:58:09.367]  You found it.
[01:58:09.467 --> 01:58:10.528]  The tip of the spear.
[01:58:10.868 --> 01:58:13.831]  The very front line in the Info War.
[01:58:14.451 --> 01:58:18.815]  I'm Alex Jones, attempting to defend the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:58:19.296 --> 01:58:21.498]  My now 12-plus year quest
[01:58:22.319 --> 01:58:25.000]  We are deep in the enemy territory, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:26.320]  We are completely surrounded.
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:29.081]  Don't let any of the New World Order scum escape.
[01:58:29.581 --> 01:58:31.082]  Christina Ebersole is our guest.
[01:58:31.102 --> 01:58:35.703]  I've got to let her go because she's got to get into the city and get into work and do a bunch of other important things.
[01:58:35.983 --> 01:58:38.364]  Can't wait to meet her in person coming up this Sunday.
[01:58:38.384 --> 01:58:40.744]  She's going to be at the same event where we're premiering Endgame.
[01:58:40.764 --> 01:58:42.705]  She's going to be singing at about 7.30 at night.
[01:58:43.185 --> 01:58:45.106]  I look forward to meeting her and her husband in person.
[01:58:45.866 --> 01:58:48.166]  Christine, just in closing, finishing up that story.
[01:58:48.186 --> 01:58:50.247]  I mean, I kind of quickly told it.
[01:58:50.982 --> 01:58:56.504]  I've never really told it fully on air, but now we have a few more minutes and then you can finish your story.
[01:58:57.705 --> 01:59:02.587]  Charlie, when he first contacted me months before he came on air, had been researching 9-11 for a couple of years.
[01:59:02.767 --> 01:59:03.607]  He and his brother had.
[01:59:09.967 --> 01:59:13.408]  Yeah, maybe we should have an event, like a film festival, a big symposium.
[01:59:13.428 --> 01:59:14.168]  That was all his idea.
[01:59:14.188 --> 01:59:14.989]  That's why we had it out there.
[01:59:15.009 --> 01:59:17.849]  I was like, hey man, do what you want, because I'm not going to pressure you.
[01:59:18.670 --> 01:59:19.590]  Sounds like a great idea.
[01:59:19.630 --> 01:59:21.711]  You've been saying you want to do it for months, so we might as well do it.
[01:59:22.911 --> 01:59:25.292]  And then a couple minutes later, we're out there.
[01:59:25.332 --> 01:59:25.992]  Nobody's around us.
[01:59:26.012 --> 01:59:26.852]  He wasn't listening to us.
[01:59:26.872 --> 01:59:28.893]  We kind of got off in a corner by some shrubs.
[01:59:29.153 --> 01:59:30.893]  He wanted to be left alone, eat a hamburger.
[01:59:33.366 --> 01:59:37.053]  All of a sudden, a black guy walks up and says, Oh, Alex Jones.
[01:59:37.073 --> 01:59:37.995]  Hey, Charlie Sheen.
[01:59:38.015 --> 01:59:38.776]  Thank you for what you've done.
[01:59:38.816 --> 01:59:39.618]  I appreciate your courage.
[01:59:39.918 --> 01:59:41.802]  You ought to have some big event in Los Angeles.
[01:59:42.964 --> 01:59:48.868]  I mean, he was real calm and real sweet, and I'm not saying he was actually an angel, but, you know, angels working through him, whatever.
[01:59:49.168 --> 01:59:54.492]  Very, you know, this is, I mean, this was, had that feeling, and he walks off and Charlie goes, well, that's a sign.
[01:59:54.952 --> 02:00:03.758]  But, I mean, that stuff happened so much in my life, but you were telling, you're, you know, you're laying in the back seat, depressed, going up to a spa, and the guy in the front starts talking about 9-11 and bombs.
[02:00:04.598 --> 02:00:05.679]  It's just amazing, isn't it?
[02:00:06.445 --> 02:00:20.435]  No, it is, because when you stand on purpose, the universe supports you, because the universe bends towards justice, so we have the support of the universe, and that's what was so comforting to get that.
[02:00:20.875 --> 02:00:31.582]  You know, here I was in this absolute terrified state, and God sent me through this person who had no idea who I was, no idea what was going on inside of my mind, and
[02:00:33.523 --> 02:00:35.144]  Tell me about where he was on 9-11.
[02:00:35.204 --> 02:00:36.285]  I don't know where.
[02:00:36.685 --> 02:00:37.465]  I never asked him.
[02:00:38.866 --> 02:00:41.829]  And so I just, I said, I can't tell you how much that means to me.
[02:00:42.209 --> 02:00:43.390]  And I told him what was happening.
[02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:46.252]  I was going to be in the National Enquirer and I was so scared.
[02:00:46.312 --> 02:00:49.234]  And, you know, people literally, I had reporters say to me,
[02:00:50.050 --> 02:00:53.532]  Uh, you know, all this big lead up to the Tonys, like, aren't you afraid?
[02:00:53.552 --> 02:00:55.934]  I mean, you know, you have people, you're an actress!
[02:00:56.194 --> 02:00:59.296]  You have people that are going to be voting for you for this performance!
[02:00:59.636 --> 02:01:04.299]  Aren't you afraid that you're chasing these 9-11 conspiracy theories?
[02:01:04.639 --> 02:01:06.580]  That this is going to destroy your career?
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:08.582]  And I said, what?
[02:01:08.642 --> 02:01:12.224]  So that you can put on my tombstone, God, she was funny?
[02:01:12.244 --> 02:01:15.286]  You think that's why God put me on Earth?
[02:01:16.587 --> 02:01:19.169]  So I could do some sitcom in California?
[02:01:19.569 --> 02:01:22.051]  I don't think that's why I was put here.
[02:01:22.171 --> 02:01:28.395]  I mean, I, you know, of course, I can give the gift of sharing with the talent that God gave me.
[02:01:28.595 --> 02:01:33.159]  Exactly, but I mean, these are the more serious issues, and I mean, this body is nothing but an earth suit.
[02:01:33.239 --> 02:01:36.621]  We are here to be tested, and that's the one thing I've learned, and I know it in my heart.
[02:01:36.681 --> 02:01:38.462]  We are being tested, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:38.642 --> 02:01:39.623]  Would you agree with that, Christine?
[02:01:40.704 --> 02:01:45.027]  Well, I think it's really about helping
[02:01:45.868 --> 02:01:46.028]  I don't
[02:02:08.493 --> 02:02:11.456]  Absolutely.
[02:02:11.776 --> 02:02:13.078]  Christine, we are out of time.
[02:02:13.158 --> 02:02:15.300]  Thank you for spending so much time with us again.
[02:02:15.340 --> 02:02:16.682]  I look forward to seeing you this Sunday.
[02:02:16.902 --> 02:02:19.845]  And from the bottom of my heart and from all my listeners, I know they feel the same.
[02:02:20.106 --> 02:02:25.392]  We salute your maverick spirit of liberty and freedom, your incredible courage,
[02:02:25.872 --> 02:02:33.894]  And I am honored to consider you one of my friends, and I am honored that I even get a chance to talk to people of so much courage and just filled with so much goodness.
[02:02:34.154 --> 02:02:34.674]  God bless you.
[02:02:34.694 --> 02:02:35.815]  I'll see you in the city.
[02:02:36.475 --> 02:02:37.095]  I can't wait.
[02:02:37.295 --> 02:02:38.235]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:02:38.495 --> 02:02:39.396]  Take care, Christine.
[02:02:39.736 --> 02:02:43.337]  We'll come back with your calls and a ton of news right here on GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:45.874 --> 02:02:50.799]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[02:03:48.128 --> 02:03:53.632]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:53.992 --> 02:04:01.638]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.324 --> 02:04:09.388]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.788 --> 02:04:21.174]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.514 --> 02:04:25.036]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.477 --> 02:04:27.418]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.738 --> 02:04:31.580]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:44.801 --> 02:04:48.904]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[02:04:49.144 --> 02:04:54.227]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[02:04:54.527 --> 02:04:59.150]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[02:04:59.510 --> 02:05:01.471]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[02:05:01.772 --> 02:05:07.635]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:05:07.995 --> 02:05:08.756]  And it works.
[02:05:09.196 --> 02:05:10.657]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[02:05:11.037 --> 02:05:12.058]  Now it's your turn.
[02:05:12.318 --> 02:05:14.679]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[02:05:14.819 --> 02:05:19.101]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[02:05:19.402 --> 02:05:22.503]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[02:05:22.863 --> 02:05:25.085]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[02:05:25.265 --> 02:05:27.626]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[02:05:27.646 --> 02:05:27.866]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[02:05:27.906 --> 02:05:29.787]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:05:38.632 --> 02:05:47.737]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.298 --> 02:05:51.139]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:54.441]  Alright, you guys have been holding long enough.
[02:05:54.461 --> 02:05:55.342]  Let's go to your calls.
[02:05:55.842 --> 02:05:58.544]  Thomas in Kansas and Cliff, Jim, Omar, Mark and others.
[02:05:59.004 --> 02:05:59.945]  Thomas, you're on the air.
[02:06:00.705 --> 02:06:02.146]  Hey Alex, what's going on man?
[02:06:02.978 --> 02:06:04.460]  We are here fighting the New World Order.
[02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:05.081]  What's on your mind?
[02:06:05.462 --> 02:06:06.143]  I hear you, brother.
[02:06:06.163 --> 02:06:08.827]  Hey, I got a couple questions for you here.
[02:06:08.947 --> 02:06:11.791]  I just want to say my wife and I love listening to your show.
[02:06:12.412 --> 02:06:17.320]  She used to think you were crazy, but she finally started listening and she can't get enough of you.
[02:06:19.036 --> 02:06:20.097]  Well, thanks for tuning in.
[02:06:20.117 --> 02:06:21.378]  Listen, I wish I was crazy.
[02:06:21.658 --> 02:06:24.981]  And I am a little bit crazy, actually, but this stuff we're talking about is real.
[02:06:25.481 --> 02:06:32.947]  She used to think I was crazy until she finally started waking up, but anyhow, my question is about, my first, I've got two questions.
[02:06:33.587 --> 02:06:44.776]  My question is about, I'm looking at a Washington Post article on August 6th by Glenn Kessler, and the article, I'm sure you've covered it, it's about the Pentagon losing track of the 190,000
[02:06:46.764 --> 02:06:48.846]  Assault rifles and pistols, the Pentagon.
[02:06:50.047 --> 02:06:50.868]  They lost track of them.
[02:06:50.908 --> 02:06:52.770]  I'm wondering... Yes, I did see that.
[02:06:53.310 --> 02:06:54.652]  Who manufactured those?
[02:06:54.692 --> 02:06:56.794]  Who was the... I mean, were they even made?
[02:06:57.634 --> 02:07:02.018]  You know, what was the... Because they never say who manufactured it.
[02:07:02.038 --> 02:07:02.799]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[02:07:02.839 --> 02:07:03.700]  This is what they do.
[02:07:05.302 --> 02:07:08.765]  They'll report on... Did you hear about the $2 million screws?
[02:07:10.462 --> 02:07:12.024]  Uh, yeah, actually I did.
[02:07:12.184 --> 02:07:13.425]  Now, I'm just throwing that number out.
[02:07:13.465 --> 02:07:20.731]  It was like 90-something million dollars for a bag of screws, but it came out to a couple million per screw.
[02:07:20.751 --> 02:07:22.112]  Uh-huh.
[02:07:22.433 --> 02:07:23.774]  And that was the shipping charge.
[02:07:24.254 --> 02:07:28.718]  The screws cost less than a dollar, but it was... I mean, pull it up on Google.
[02:07:28.738 --> 02:07:34.223]  I forget the exact number, but I think it was... Memory says 90-something million for a couple screws.
[02:07:34.243 --> 02:07:35.364]  Right, right.
[02:07:35.384 --> 02:07:36.145]  A couple bags of screws.
[02:07:37.117 --> 02:07:38.618]  Uh, being mailed to Iraq.
[02:07:39.178 --> 02:07:43.961]  And see, they put that out to make you think that's where the fraud's going on.
[02:07:43.981 --> 02:07:48.524]  That's the old $800 toilet seats and $500 hammers.
[02:07:48.904 --> 02:07:49.204]  Right.
[02:07:50.405 --> 02:07:52.286]  Now that's taxpayer's money, right?
[02:07:52.366 --> 02:07:53.026]  Yes, yes.
[02:07:53.086 --> 02:07:57.269]  But what's really going on is that... I keep saying $4 trillion.
[02:07:57.469 --> 02:07:59.110]  It was a year ago last time I looked it up.
[02:07:59.130 --> 02:08:02.612]  And people pull it up and they go, wait a minute, this says $1.9 trillion.
[02:08:03.072 --> 02:08:04.413]  Yes, the September 5th
[02:08:07.046 --> 02:08:12.329]  Associated Press, 2001, says 1.9 trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[02:08:12.750 --> 02:08:14.230]  Now it's over 4 trillion.
[02:08:14.991 --> 02:08:20.314]  Because I've watched the Congressional Armed Service meetings about it each year.
[02:08:20.714 --> 02:08:23.356]  People grab the clips, put them on the web, and I'm able to see them.
[02:08:23.416 --> 02:08:30.500]  It's kind of like our listeners are almost like collators and they boil it down for me.
[02:08:30.540 --> 02:08:31.681]  I can just see it out there on the web.
[02:08:31.701 --> 02:08:34.623]  We can all interface kind of into the group mind here.
[02:08:35.083 --> 02:08:36.344]  But side issue.
[02:08:37.353 --> 02:08:40.375]  It's watched by people, that's how I'm able to track the numbers.
[02:08:40.935 --> 02:08:47.719]  And it comes up during these hearings, and they just go, 3 trillion missing, 4 trillion missing, and it's just, we're not going to answer, we're not going to say.
[02:08:48.319 --> 02:08:55.603]  And so, they'll bust some army captain who orders 20 computers and sells them out the back of a SUV.
[02:08:55.623 --> 02:09:00.426]  Or they'll bust some colonel who's caught
[02:09:01.204 --> 02:09:04.945]  You know, getting prepaid phone cards and selling them.
[02:09:05.406 --> 02:09:11.948]  And that literally, last time I checked, only came up to $3 billion in 2005 of stolen money that year.
[02:09:12.168 --> 02:09:15.309]  And then hundreds of billions was other big scams.
[02:09:16.429 --> 02:09:17.070]  Here's an example.
[02:09:17.090 --> 02:09:20.511]  You got a couple billion dollars in insider trading right before 9-11.
[02:09:21.311 --> 02:09:26.333]  But they don't bust the head of the CIA, the executive director, and others that were clearly involved in it.
[02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:32.052]  They go bust two New York FBI agents who got word about it and made a million dollars off of it.
[02:09:32.812 --> 02:09:34.032]  See, and they sent them to prison.
[02:09:34.972 --> 02:09:36.093]  So, see, that's what they'll do.
[02:09:36.133 --> 02:09:42.095]  They'll bust the little guy and the little fish to create the illusion that they're doing something.
[02:09:42.135 --> 02:09:44.556]  But, look, a bunch of guns missing, that's nothing.
[02:09:45.156 --> 02:09:48.017]  I mean, those were probably just stolen at a warehouse and sold.
[02:09:48.037 --> 02:09:52.698]  I mean, forgive me for laughing, but it's like almost humorous how stupid they think we are.
[02:09:53.098 --> 02:09:55.079]  I mean, you know, it's just like,
[02:09:55.592 --> 02:09:59.835]  And then they say, you know, 2.3 trillion missing or 1.9 trillion missing September 5th.
[02:09:59.855 --> 02:10:02.037]  It's like, why wasn't that investigated?
[02:10:03.919 --> 02:10:04.859]  That's what I mean!
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:08.262]  Listen, I like illegal aliens.
[02:10:08.282 --> 02:10:09.703]  They're good, hard-working people.
[02:10:10.144 --> 02:10:11.144]  I have nothing against them.
[02:10:11.665 --> 02:10:16.108]  I don't like the fact that they've been taught to hate America, and I can read their writings where they're saying it.
[02:10:16.529 --> 02:10:19.571]  But, I'm not bashing them when I'm mad.
[02:10:21.218 --> 02:10:25.840]  That they don't have to have an ID for a house loan, a car loan, or a bank account.
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:27.141]  That's in the news.
[02:10:27.421 --> 02:10:31.463]  Homeland Security signs off on it when it became a controversy five months ago.
[02:10:32.483 --> 02:10:33.944]  We've been reporting on it for four years.
[02:10:34.324 --> 02:10:36.985]  Finally broke early this year on CNN.
[02:10:37.385 --> 02:10:38.386]  They had a controversy.
[02:10:38.426 --> 02:10:41.887]  Homeland Security said they don't have to have it, but citizens do.
[02:10:42.487 --> 02:10:43.228]  It's wrong.
[02:10:43.328 --> 02:10:44.988]  It shows that it's lawless.
[02:10:45.709 --> 02:10:45.949]  Right.
[02:10:46.551 --> 02:10:49.374]  I mean, a guy comes out of a circuit city and they want to search him.
[02:10:49.414 --> 02:10:50.115]  He says, no.
[02:10:50.695 --> 02:10:52.417]  The cops come, look in his bag.
[02:10:52.537 --> 02:10:53.958]  It's the video game and the receipt.
[02:10:54.559 --> 02:11:00.405]  And they say, okay, you legally bought it, but not letting them search you was disorderly, even though they admit he was polite.
[02:11:00.425 --> 02:11:01.506]  And they go, you're going to jail!
[02:11:02.270 --> 02:11:05.873]  Well, yeah, what gets me is, like, okay, what's the whole Iran deal?
[02:11:06.033 --> 02:11:21.984]  If they said they did manufacture all these arms, and they lost them in Iraq, and now the insurgents have them, or the militias have them, but now they're blaming Iran for funding, you know, not funding, but giving arms to Iraqi insurgents, I mean, isn't that not what the United States government's doing?
[02:11:23.765 --> 02:11:24.486]  Absolutely.
[02:11:24.786 --> 02:11:30.090]  Look, they're using the Sunni brigades to fight with the Shiites,
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:39.124]  And they're using Sunni Brigades, publicly led by the number three in Al-Qaeda, to literally go into the Iran and attack them.
[02:11:39.224 --> 02:11:46.647]  Iran shells back, and then the news claims Iran's just shelling... Al-Qaeda is shelling Iraq, they've said.
[02:11:46.867 --> 02:11:49.108]  And it's literally Al-Qaeda attacking Iran!
[02:11:49.128 --> 02:11:51.189]  It's unbelievable, man.
[02:11:51.429 --> 02:11:52.750]  It's just totally unbelievable.
[02:11:52.770 --> 02:11:55.811]  I mean, it's just... I mean, we're not that stupid.
[02:11:55.971 --> 02:11:59.993]  I mean, you know, it's like Bush gets up and goes to Iraq,
[02:12:00.689 --> 02:12:07.754]  He's got like, you know, 30 or 50 Marines around him that are all just, you know, acting just ignorant.
[02:12:08.795 --> 02:12:10.836]  And I mean, are these like paid off Marines?
[02:12:10.916 --> 02:12:13.298]  Are these like, you know, what is the deal with that?
[02:12:13.318 --> 02:12:14.119]  No, they believe it.
[02:12:14.159 --> 02:12:16.040]  Listen, they're there risking their lives.
[02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:18.642]  I mean, you have to even admire them at a certain level.
[02:12:18.662 --> 02:12:20.783]  They're putting themselves in harm's way.
[02:12:21.004 --> 02:12:22.545]  They believe they're fighting for America.
[02:12:22.565 --> 02:12:23.105]  They're fooled.
[02:12:23.385 --> 02:12:24.366]  I appreciate your call.
[02:12:25.827 --> 02:12:27.828]  And I appreciate you holding, Thomas, to tell us that.
[02:12:29.611 --> 02:12:32.432]  They believe that they were attacked by Iraq on 9-11.
[02:12:32.572 --> 02:12:34.292]  Forty percent of Americans still believe that.
[02:12:35.172 --> 02:12:44.754]  They are there risking their lives, and by God, they're not going to now say it's all for nothing, not when mama and daddy have got a yellow ribbon outside and are real proud of them.
[02:12:45.934 --> 02:12:47.734]  These are salt of the earth people.
[02:12:48.294 --> 02:12:49.494]  But yes, they're ignorant.
[02:12:50.014 --> 02:12:56.716]  Listen, the Germans were very, very patriotic, very moral people.
[02:12:56.776 --> 02:12:58.676]  They had very low crime rates in Germany.
[02:12:59.446 --> 02:13:04.909]  The Germans, on average, would give you the shirt off their back, because I've read the anthropology on them.
[02:13:05.609 --> 02:13:10.052]  I mean, they were some of the most upbeat, nice, friendly, hard-working people in Europe.
[02:13:10.512 --> 02:13:18.096]  And they had a few years of depression, and Hitler came along and could talk slick, and, man, they were ready to kill anybody and anything and do whatever they were told.
[02:13:18.636 --> 02:13:21.338]  Because, by golly, it was for Germany.
[02:13:21.398 --> 02:13:22.298]  It was for Deutschland.
[02:13:23.359 --> 02:13:25.560]  And it's the same thing.
[02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:27.701]  I look at a lot of those young men.
[02:13:28.752 --> 02:13:29.352]  Okay.
[02:13:29.392 --> 02:13:29.652]  Hello.
[02:13:58.388 --> 02:13:59.308]  Yes, Cliff, how you doing?
[02:13:59.649 --> 02:14:00.489]  I'm doing alright.
[02:14:00.689 --> 02:14:02.130]  I wanted to ask you a question.
[02:14:03.190 --> 02:14:06.752]  Do you know if they ever have a vaccine for the bird flu or whatever?
[02:14:07.672 --> 02:14:13.775]  You know, I said I'd get into stories from Endgame last night and people bringing up what happened when they got vaccinated.
[02:14:13.795 --> 02:14:15.136]  I want to tell those stories.
[02:14:15.156 --> 02:14:16.156]  Don't let me forget, folks.
[02:14:16.996 --> 02:14:21.278]  But yes, they claim they've got a vaccine, experimental ones, for the bird flu.
[02:14:21.298 --> 02:14:22.659]  The problem is it's always mutating.
[02:14:23.439 --> 02:14:25.320]  Well, no, they're full of bullshit.
[02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:26.921]  I've got the documents on it and
[02:14:28.424 --> 02:14:30.125]  Listen, sir, I appreciate your call.
[02:14:30.145 --> 02:14:33.447]  This is not a show for you to call in and just talk however you want.
[02:14:33.467 --> 02:14:34.628]  I'm sorry, Cliff, okay?
[02:14:35.108 --> 02:14:38.410]  We have a lot of children listening, and I just have a modicum of respect here.
[02:14:38.710 --> 02:14:42.613]  We don't screen your calls, we don't screen out what you have to say, and just don't call for six months.
[02:14:42.633 --> 02:14:43.113]  How's that sound?
[02:14:43.653 --> 02:14:43.953]  Okay?
[02:14:44.794 --> 02:14:46.395]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Oregon.
[02:14:46.455 --> 02:14:47.235]  Jim, you're on the air.
[02:14:50.998 --> 02:14:51.758]  Jim, you're on the air.
[02:14:51.798 --> 02:14:52.158]  Go ahead.
[02:14:52.739 --> 02:14:53.259]  Hi, Alex.
[02:14:53.799 --> 02:14:54.440]  Love your show.
[02:14:54.540 --> 02:14:54.800]  Thank you.
[02:14:55.887 --> 02:15:00.329]  I just wanted to point out a few things about the 9-11 special that was on the History Channel.
[02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:14.655]  Pretty ludicrous things like the jetliner liquefying before it went into the Pentagon, and another guy they had on as a structural engineer, Matt Levy, who co-wrote the book, Why Buildings Fall Down.
[02:15:15.075 --> 02:15:18.477]  They had him on there saying that it wasn't an implosion,
[02:15:18.959 --> 02:15:25.740]  But earlier on the Discovery Channel, he did another show, after September 11th, in which he says it was a demolition.
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:37.982]  And the only other point I had was, up here in Oregon, we have Senator John Menace, who wrote the bill HR 666, I believe it was called, about terrorism.
[02:15:38.802 --> 02:15:48.264]  And he got voted out of office, but mysteriously, our governor appointed him to the safety coordinator of the Department of Transportation.
[02:15:48.743 --> 02:15:49.883]  In which he is in right now.
[02:15:50.643 --> 02:15:52.464]  And I just wanted your comments on all of that.
[02:15:56.284 --> 02:15:57.745]  666 was a separate bill he did.
[02:15:57.765 --> 02:16:00.785]  I don't remember the exact bill number.
[02:16:02.666 --> 02:16:04.786]  It'll pop in my head in just a minute because that was 2002.
[02:16:06.066 --> 02:16:08.387]  But it had more than 200 subsections.
[02:16:08.407 --> 02:16:09.607]  I ought to pull that back up.
[02:16:11.107 --> 02:16:15.588]  I think the headline of the story we wrote about it was Oregon Long
[02:16:17.213 --> 02:16:19.054]  Creates forced labor camps.
[02:16:19.295 --> 02:16:20.475]  I think that's the headline.
[02:16:22.237 --> 02:16:25.639]  And then just put Senator Menace after it, and it should pop up.
[02:16:25.799 --> 02:16:27.000]  And that's not a pun.
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:28.441]  He really, his name's Menace.
[02:16:28.561 --> 02:16:30.342]  He is literally a menace to freedom.
[02:16:31.763 --> 02:16:36.186]  He was the chairman of the Public Safety Committee.
[02:16:36.246 --> 02:16:37.768]  No, it was the Judicial Committee.
[02:16:39.789 --> 02:16:42.391]  And in the bill it said if you download one song,
[02:16:43.792 --> 02:16:51.534]  Uncivilly, life in prison, unless you agree to forced labor camp, then 25 years in a forest labor camp.
[02:16:52.834 --> 02:16:56.155]  And local news did a report and said they're building forest labor camps.
[02:16:56.395 --> 02:16:57.095]  We aired that here.
[02:16:57.155 --> 02:16:58.496]  That's unbelievable.
[02:16:59.756 --> 02:17:10.619]  And then it said if you have a gun illegally, any violation, that you will be given life in prison or 25 years if you agree to work in a slave camp.
[02:17:11.624 --> 02:17:13.425]  Then they say it's not a slave camp, because you agree.
[02:17:13.445 --> 02:17:15.285]  25 years!
[02:17:16.406 --> 02:17:19.847]  And it just... You cannot make stuff up like this.
[02:17:22.587 --> 02:17:27.169]  Then about a year after that, Rhode Island tried to say, if you criticize government, you'll be arrested.
[02:17:29.730 --> 02:17:34.851]  And they reported that in straight face on Rhode Island TV and in the Journal.
[02:17:36.132 --> 02:17:37.252]  The paper there in Providence.
[02:17:38.162 --> 02:17:39.787]  I mean, it just said word for word.
[02:17:40.209 --> 02:17:41.533]  No criticism of the government.
[02:17:41.935 --> 02:17:43.159]  You'll be put in a camp if you do.
[02:17:45.836 --> 02:17:50.437]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.

[02:20:49.033 --> 02:20:57.640]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number 1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:20:58.621 --> 02:21:03.506]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[02:21:04.605 --> 02:21:06.406]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:21:06.806 --> 02:21:07.626]  There may be more.
[02:21:08.787 --> 02:21:15.589]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?

[02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:58.883]  I haven't even gotten into all the global warming news.
[02:21:59.003 --> 02:22:01.145]  It just goes from crazy to nutty.
[02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:08.321]  Also, I want to tell some stories about what happened last night at the premiere of Endgame.
[02:22:09.841 --> 02:22:11.041]  It'll be showing again tonight.
[02:22:11.061 --> 02:22:12.201]  I think there's still a few tickets left.
[02:22:12.701 --> 02:22:13.482]  And tomorrow night.
[02:22:15.822 --> 02:22:17.802]  Let's go to Omar in Michigan.
[02:22:17.942 --> 02:22:19.283]  Omar, thanks for holding, sir.
[02:22:19.323 --> 02:22:19.643]  Welcome.
[02:22:20.503 --> 02:22:21.523]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:22:21.643 --> 02:22:22.183]  Good, my friend.
[02:22:23.003 --> 02:22:28.364]  Your guest, Christine, she hit the nail right on the head, because I can agree.
[02:22:28.424 --> 02:22:33.165]  Just like she said, whenever I need something, it's like it's sent to me.
[02:22:34.068 --> 02:22:35.649]  I needed a book on masonry.
[02:22:35.709 --> 02:22:37.130]  I got morals and dogma.
[02:22:38.130 --> 02:22:45.214]  So I could just say, you know, like, Hey, she was right on and I commend her courage as well as yours.
[02:22:45.414 --> 02:22:51.197]  And, uh, all the, uh, people that help provide this information for us.
[02:22:52.438 --> 02:22:57.801]  And, uh, I just like to say, everybody needs to get on the same page and get ready to fight.
[02:22:58.683 --> 02:23:00.745]  Because we're in a fight for our lives.
[02:23:00.805 --> 02:23:03.147]  You know, they have threatened to kill us.
[02:23:03.267 --> 02:23:04.768]  We have done nothing to them.
[02:23:05.489 --> 02:23:08.511]  And we have a right to kill anybody that's trying to kill us.
[02:23:09.852 --> 02:23:10.593]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:23:10.613 --> 02:23:12.274]  We do have a right to defend ourselves.
[02:23:13.115 --> 02:23:17.038]  Omar, is my memory wrong, or have you been calling into the show off and on?
[02:23:17.058 --> 02:23:20.501]  Sometimes you might not even call in for a year, then you might call in, you know, every month.
[02:23:21.222 --> 02:23:23.363]  But have you been calling into the show for like ten years?
[02:23:24.064 --> 02:23:24.845]  Yeah, about that.
[02:23:26.044 --> 02:23:30.808]  Well, I mean, what is it like for you to see so much that has happened?
[02:23:31.328 --> 02:23:34.091]  Because I remember you were calling in ten years ago and you were informed.
[02:23:34.111 --> 02:23:37.894]  I mean, what is it like to see it in the fullness of time unfolding?
[02:23:38.094 --> 02:23:38.434]  Go ahead.
[02:23:39.395 --> 02:23:47.581]  Alex, I didn't ever think it would go this far because I thought the American people had too much sense to get played like this.
[02:23:47.681 --> 02:23:50.424]  I was always saying the New World Order had never worked.
[02:23:50.684 --> 02:23:51.905]  I've been studying this since 1985.
[02:23:56.485 --> 02:24:02.087]  You know, I just was like, man, the Constitution, they ain't going to let nothing mess with their Constitution.
[02:24:02.667 --> 02:24:03.448]  You crazy.
[02:24:04.268 --> 02:24:10.691]  And I was just looking at it, you know, basically when I first started doing this, I was as racist as anybody else.
[02:24:11.891 --> 02:24:16.393]  But then I was informed and, you know, I started talking to people.
[02:24:16.413 --> 02:24:19.574]  I was dealing with various militia groups at the time.
[02:24:19.654 --> 02:24:21.515]  There's too scared to say anything now.
[02:24:22.592 --> 02:24:25.973]  And, uh, I studied, you know, I listened to Bill Cooper.
[02:24:25.993 --> 02:24:27.334]  I talked to Bill Cooper.
[02:24:27.414 --> 02:24:39.398]  I talked to Dr. John Coleman and various other people, you know, and like now, you know, it's like, here it is right in front of our faces.
[02:24:40.258 --> 02:24:44.640]  And then the people that's doing this is so corrupt and diabolical.
[02:24:45.460 --> 02:24:46.841]  You know, it just amazes me.
[02:24:46.881 --> 02:24:49.922]  We got people that say, well, we had to forgive them.
[02:24:50.578 --> 02:24:51.098]  Listen to that.
[02:24:51.198 --> 02:24:58.559]  These people, I believe, just like in the Bible would say, these people need to be destroyed, every man, woman, and child of them.
[02:24:59.239 --> 02:25:01.660]  So that this stuff will never reappear again.
[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:11.982]  We keep on making excuses for them and, you know, we want to obey the rules and everything and, you know, hey, we're in a fight for our lives.
[02:25:12.202 --> 02:25:14.822]  You know, like you say, it's a war on for your mind.
[02:25:15.382 --> 02:25:18.223]  Either they got it or we, we got it.
[02:25:19.043 --> 02:25:20.303]  If you're not on our side,
[02:25:21.124 --> 02:25:22.225]  Then go on your way.
[02:25:22.585 --> 02:25:23.645]  And they've said that too!
[02:25:23.705 --> 02:25:24.406]  They've said that.
[02:25:24.606 --> 02:25:25.547]  They say that every day.
[02:25:25.587 --> 02:25:27.468]  They say, you better serve us or you're against us.
[02:25:27.688 --> 02:25:28.528]  Fine, I'm against you.
[02:25:28.548 --> 02:25:29.449]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:25:29.469 --> 02:25:30.169]  Fine, I'm against you.
[02:25:30.369 --> 02:25:30.749]  Exactly.
[02:25:30.789 --> 02:25:31.510]  I'm against you too.
[02:25:31.710 --> 02:25:32.691]  I'm against them too.
[02:25:33.371 --> 02:25:36.973]  And like, I'm saying everybody that's either with us or against us.
[02:25:37.053 --> 02:25:42.416]  It's the will of the people and the spirit of the people is greater than any threat that they could throw up.
[02:25:42.836 --> 02:25:44.717]  That's what Huey P. Newton said.
[02:25:45.058 --> 02:25:49.320]  I remember reading federal documents 10-12 years ago about FEMA camps and their plans and I thought,
[02:25:50.004 --> 02:25:58.808]  Man, they'll never get away with that, but then I realized, wait, they say they're going to use terrorism and fear, and they're going to ratchet it up.
[02:25:58.868 --> 02:26:07.933]  Every time there's an event, they'll tighten the noose tighter, then another event tighter, another event tighter, but people are starting to wake up, but I agree with you, it's gone further than I thought it could.
[02:26:08.433 --> 02:26:14.376]  Right, and see, the thing is, like I'm saying, when it's an act of terror, who does it benefit?
[02:26:14.436 --> 02:26:16.217]  It don't benefit us, because the cowards
[02:26:16.789 --> 02:26:23.431]  They blow up discotheques or shopping malls or something.
[02:26:23.471 --> 02:26:25.031]  They're trying to change our minds.
[02:26:25.051 --> 02:26:28.473]  We got to know that it's them doing this to us.
[02:26:29.073 --> 02:26:30.333]  It's not the terrorists.
[02:26:30.373 --> 02:26:37.715]  How obvious does it get when we have Republican memos and then they go public with them saying they love 9-11 and it gets us to submit to them?
[02:26:37.975 --> 02:26:41.737]  I mean, for all these people out there who call me and email me and say, why would the government do that?
[02:26:41.977 --> 02:26:46.418]  They tell you why, because it makes you get down there and lick their boots and do whatever they say!
[02:26:47.051 --> 02:26:51.293]  Right, and if you're a bootlicker, you're the worst kind of person in the world.
[02:26:52.634 --> 02:26:56.016]  How could you be a bootlicker to something that's scum?
[02:26:57.036 --> 02:26:58.257]  That's what these people are.
[02:26:58.297 --> 02:27:01.698]  They got money, they got power, they got wealth, but they're just scum.
[02:27:02.719 --> 02:27:05.340]  Because even with all that, they're not a human being.
[02:27:06.681 --> 02:27:07.281]  No, you're right.
[02:27:07.321 --> 02:27:13.985]  I mean, anybody who can kill children cold-bloodedly and enjoy it is just the lowest form of crap.
[02:27:14.685 --> 02:27:16.166]  It's always good to hear from you, Omar.
[02:27:16.206 --> 02:27:16.726]  God bless you.
[02:27:18.428 --> 02:27:19.748]  And I mean that when I say it.
[02:27:19.828 --> 02:27:21.149]  I mean, these people, I've studied them.
[02:27:21.409 --> 02:27:24.189]  There's something wrong with them.
[02:27:24.989 --> 02:27:26.330]  There's something wrong with them.
[02:27:27.310 --> 02:27:30.671]  I mean, how do you line little toddlers up and blow their heads off?
[02:27:31.171 --> 02:27:32.131]  Much less enjoy it.
[02:27:35.792 --> 02:27:36.712]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.192 --> 02:27:38.792]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.712 --> 02:27:42.393]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.242 --> 02:27:51.304]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[02:27:52.065 --> 02:27:59.869]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[02:27:59.889 --> 02:28:05.713]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts,
[02:28:06.483 --> 02:28:12.484]  Now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:28:12.584 --> 02:28:19.826]  Central, formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated but never duplicated.
[02:28:20.526 --> 02:28:26.867]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:28:27.407 --> 02:28:32.488]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[02:28:33.228 --> 02:28:35.709]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story.
[02:28:36.425 --> 02:28:38.727]  But the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[02:28:39.107 --> 02:28:40.508]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[02:28:40.588 --> 02:28:42.630]  Central with The Divided Kingdom.
[02:28:46.045 --> 02:28:47.886]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:28:48.026 --> 02:28:53.209]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:28:53.369 --> 02:28:54.730]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:28:54.990 --> 02:29:03.155]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:29:03.375 --> 02:29:09.118]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:29:09.278 --> 02:29:11.060]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:13.282]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:29:13.422 --> 02:29:17.667]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:29:17.847 --> 02:29:19.989]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:29:20.069 --> 02:29:27.437]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:29:27.677 --> 02:29:28.157]  I'm healthy.
[02:29:46.318 --> 02:29:48.860]  Is credit card debt making your life stressful?
[02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:52.502]  Do you avoid answering the phone in fear of another creditor calling?
[02:29:52.782 --> 02:29:56.305]  How would you like to cut your credit card balances by as much as half?
[02:29:56.685 --> 02:29:57.765]  Well, now you can!
[02:29:58.146 --> 02:30:06.331]  Safeguard Debt Management Services will connect you with a debt management specialist who will negotiate with your creditors to reduce your balances by as much as
[02:30:06.431 --> 02:30:07.312]  I think so.
[02:30:22.383 --> 02:30:22.763]  I think so.
[02:30:49.329 --> 02:30:49.709]  Sing Ray!
[02:30:49.770 --> 02:30:50.270]  Sing Ray!
[02:30:50.310 --> 02:30:50.651]  Sing Ray!
[02:30:50.691 --> 02:30:50.911]  Sing Ray!
[02:31:24.984 --> 02:31:26.645]  All right, welcome back my friends.
[02:31:29.286 --> 02:31:30.146]  It's real simple.
[02:31:30.306 --> 02:31:36.028]  I woke up, there was a diabolical group trying to set up one world government with public documents, public statements.
[02:31:36.568 --> 02:31:38.849]  Then I turned CNN on and they'd say it didn't exist.
[02:31:38.869 --> 02:31:39.809]  Crazy people believe it.
[02:31:39.849 --> 02:31:46.832]  And then I found out the very people pushing world population reduction and tyranny were the ones that own CNN.
[02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:50.560]  And I found out they wanted my Second Amendment.
[02:31:51.321 --> 02:31:53.041]  I found out they wanted my liberties and my freedoms.
[02:31:53.061 --> 02:31:53.961]  And I said, you know what?
[02:31:54.461 --> 02:31:55.342]  I'm going to fight you.
[02:31:55.942 --> 02:32:03.924]  I'm going to tell you just really saddening stories, but also booing at the same time, from the endgame premiere last night here in Austin, Texas.
[02:32:03.944 --> 02:32:06.024]  We're going to show it again tonight and tomorrow night.
[02:32:06.104 --> 02:32:08.565]  I think just a handful of tickets left at the door.
[02:32:08.605 --> 02:32:13.246]  They make you, in the hours before, they keep like 25 tickets buying at the door.
[02:32:13.686 --> 02:32:15.326]  So you can show up and get them at the door.
[02:32:15.666 --> 02:32:18.247]  It just, there were like two seats open last night.
[02:32:18.939 --> 02:32:24.441]  Because the Alamo Draft House calls it sold out before then.
[02:32:25.322 --> 02:32:28.303]  And then they call it sold out when there's the two front rows left.
[02:32:29.163 --> 02:32:30.844]  And then you've got to go get those tickets at the door.
[02:32:30.884 --> 02:32:31.284]  It's weird.
[02:32:31.344 --> 02:32:32.685]  You can get in if you want to.
[02:32:33.085 --> 02:32:34.646]  Just show up tonight and buy tickets.
[02:32:34.706 --> 02:32:40.028]  Or if you want to absolutely be sure, buy them online at InfoWars.com right now for tonight or tomorrow.
[02:32:43.188 --> 02:32:51.990]  I'm going to tell you about a few sponsors, I'm going to tell you the story about what happened last night, then we'll finish up with the calls of Mark, Colton, Tim, Dan, and John, and that's going to be it for calls.
[02:32:53.051 --> 02:32:58.412]  I wanted to tell you about the great folks over at eFoods Direct, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:32:58.832 --> 02:33:04.914]  The highest quality storable foods out there, bar none, and with all the uncertainty in the world, now is the time to have storable foods.
[02:33:04.974 --> 02:33:07.735]  And again, they're high quality, they're clean, they taste good.
[02:33:08.673 --> 02:33:12.134]  Uh, the meals are about 50% bigger than most of the other brands that are out there.
[02:33:12.154 --> 02:33:16.256]  Uh, you know, I made a statement a few weeks ago that MRAs make me sick.
[02:33:17.416 --> 02:33:20.158]  And I got all these emails going, I was in the military, they're delicious, they're great.
[02:33:20.278 --> 02:33:21.038]  I'm sure they are.
[02:33:21.178 --> 02:33:21.758]  I don't like them.
[02:33:22.118 --> 02:33:27.200]  Or at least the MRAs I've eaten before just taste all salty and weird and give me a stomachache.
[02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:30.341]  I mean, maybe that's anecdotal evidence, and I'm sure they're delicious.
[02:33:30.361 --> 02:33:32.882]  The point is, this is a lot better than MRAs, okay?
[02:33:33.263 --> 02:33:34.203]  That's the point I'm making.
[02:33:35.237 --> 02:33:39.924]  And they're great folks, and they're patriots.
[02:33:39.944 --> 02:33:40.404]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:33:41.245 --> 02:33:42.427]  They use food as a weapon.
[02:33:42.467 --> 02:33:44.009]  The globalists say they'll use food as a weapon.
[02:33:44.029 --> 02:33:45.091]  They used it in New Orleans.
[02:33:45.591 --> 02:33:50.278]  They've got little two-month supplies for individuals that are very inexpensive that everybody should have that bare minimum.
[02:33:50.558 --> 02:33:52.721]  And I would get a year's supply for each person in your family.
[02:33:53.633 --> 02:33:57.114]  Or get a year's supply, and for a family of three, that'll last you three or four or five months.
[02:33:57.795 --> 02:34:00.335]  Or you can have it in a supplement, whatever food you can get.
[02:34:00.776 --> 02:34:05.537]  This is an insurance policy you can eat, and that's the great part about it, and I believe in it.
[02:34:05.557 --> 02:34:10.259]  That's who I've gotten my storable foods from twice now, 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:34:10.439 --> 02:34:21.583]  E, this is the letter E, foodsdirect.com, or check out the banner on prisonplanet.com at the top of the page, or infowars.com at the top of the page.
[02:34:22.183 --> 02:34:26.647]  And speaking of food, ladies and gentlemen, there is inner food.
[02:34:27.447 --> 02:34:31.270]  And again, most vitamins, you don't absorb all the nutrients that are in them.
[02:34:31.290 --> 02:34:32.431]  Some just pass right through you.
[02:34:32.651 --> 02:34:34.333]  But the good brands, you absorb a lot of it.
[02:34:34.973 --> 02:34:40.838]  With inner food, it's just the ground up 20 plus ingredients of the highest quality.
[02:34:41.953 --> 02:34:42.753]  Yes, we are!
[02:35:00.220 --> 02:35:15.690]  Give them a call 866-762-9238 866-762-9238 or go to PrisonPlanet.com and click on the NutriCafe link there and you get 10% off when you order through the site as well.
[02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:19.753]  So ladies and gentlemen, that's ENERFOOD.COM or 866-762-9238.
[02:35:19.773 --> 02:35:20.373]  Fantastic stuff.
[02:35:20.653 --> 02:35:21.053]  Alright, look.
[02:35:28.311 --> 02:35:29.931]  I went and showed Endgame last night.
[02:35:29.971 --> 02:35:30.792]  It was jam-packed.
[02:35:30.832 --> 02:35:32.192]  About 250 great people.
[02:35:34.992 --> 02:35:36.873]  And I get up and I give my speech.
[02:35:39.313 --> 02:35:44.774]  And I mention a few things in the speech I gave.
[02:35:44.814 --> 02:35:45.814]  You'll see it on YouTube later.
[02:35:45.834 --> 02:35:49.835]  I'll put up a PrisonPlanet.tv members and it'll leak out everywhere, but that's fine.
[02:35:51.496 --> 02:35:53.276]  You'll see it in high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv soon.
[02:35:54.887 --> 02:35:55.928]  I see it there first, too.
[02:35:56.468 --> 02:36:09.058]  But side issue, the point is, is that I said the things I didn't cover in this film are the Bush and the Nazis and just how much they were involved in eugenics and I didn't spend enough time on Native Americans being sterilized and Bush Sr.
[02:36:09.098 --> 02:36:10.479]  running it with Nixon.
[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:19.726]  But I didn't get into how in Africa and Asia and Latin America they added hormones and tetanus shots to sterilize women and it caused autoimmune responses.
[02:36:26.821 --> 02:36:37.344]  And, I may have gotten to that after, because then in the question and answer, a lady brings it up that she'd gotten a tetanus shot, and before she finished I said, let me guess, you had a big autoimmune response.
[02:36:37.364 --> 02:36:38.004]  She said, yes.
[02:36:38.924 --> 02:36:41.124]  You know, almost killed her, and you know, blah, blah, blah.
[02:36:41.144 --> 02:36:54.328]  And then, we were, and then another lady comes up to me after the, when I was shaking hands and stuff, comes up to me and she says, how did you know autoimmune response?
[02:36:54.948 --> 02:36:55.728]  How did you know that?
[02:36:56.348 --> 02:36:57.208]  I mean, are you a doctor?
[02:36:57.248 --> 02:36:58.208]  How did you know that's what happened to me?
[02:36:58.248 --> 02:36:59.589]  And I said, separate lady.
[02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:01.549]  Real nice lady with her husband.
[02:37:01.969 --> 02:37:05.270]  And I said, ma'am, I said, that was in the newspapers.
[02:37:05.330 --> 02:37:08.770]  And it was in mainstream African, Indian, Latin American papers.
[02:37:08.850 --> 02:37:16.392]  Major medical institutions filed complaints, said you've added a hormone that isn't there accidentally.
[02:37:16.452 --> 02:37:18.992]  It's an expensive synthetic hormone you have to add.
[02:37:19.012 --> 02:37:22.513]  A hundred different plus, it was like a hundred and twelve manufacturers all added it.
[02:37:22.553 --> 02:37:23.813]  That was part of the UN purchase.
[02:37:25.490 --> 02:37:28.891]  And they bought it from all these different companies around the world as kind of a payoff to the locals.
[02:37:29.691 --> 02:37:31.812]  And it causes sterilization of the women.
[02:37:33.492 --> 02:37:37.513]  Upon second trimester, that hormone is secreted.
[02:37:37.853 --> 02:37:41.534]  Well, now that hormone has been artificially added to the tetanus pathogen.
[02:37:41.814 --> 02:37:45.275]  It causes an autoimmune response and causes spontaneous abortions.
[02:37:47.395 --> 02:37:49.156]  Spontaneous miscarriages.
[02:37:51.716 --> 02:37:54.378]  I heard women when I said it like going, that happened to me, that happened to me.
[02:37:54.899 --> 02:37:58.342]  And this woman was going, my God, that's what happened to me.
[02:37:59.103 --> 02:38:01.705]  By that she had a really bad autoimmune response and got real sick from it.
[02:38:01.745 --> 02:38:04.527]  She said, and I was like, listen, I'm sorry.
[02:38:04.547 --> 02:38:06.669]  That's just one area of what they're doing.
[02:38:09.031 --> 02:38:16.038]  And then I talked to this other fella and he said, yep, 18 months old, gave my son third round of shots.
[02:38:16.078 --> 02:38:17.419]  He was blowing the candles out of his,
[02:38:18.377 --> 02:38:18.658]  I think so.
[02:38:32.586 --> 02:38:41.013]  I literally have just walked up to people at hotels, movie theaters, when there's lines of autistic kids at the movies, and I'll say, 18 months of this happened?
[02:38:41.033 --> 02:38:41.413]  Mm-hmm.
[02:38:41.433 --> 02:38:41.653]  18 months?
[02:38:41.713 --> 02:38:42.514]  Mm-hmm.
[02:38:42.534 --> 02:38:42.754]  18 months?
[02:38:42.814 --> 02:38:42.974]  Mm-hmm.
[02:38:43.035 --> 02:38:43.255]  Yes.
[02:38:43.315 --> 02:38:43.455]  Mm-hmm.
[02:38:43.915 --> 02:38:45.436]  You're completely normal until 18 months?
[02:38:45.496 --> 02:38:45.717]  Mm-hmm.
[02:38:45.797 --> 02:38:45.917]  Mm-hmm.
[02:38:46.217 --> 02:38:47.578]  I mean, there's your evidence right there!
[02:38:47.618 --> 02:38:50.921]  I mean, that is just... not to mention all the studies and science, but...
[02:38:52.316 --> 02:39:00.542]  Even my listeners, and a lot of these people were brought there by their husbands, or one lady was fully informed and brought her husband, but they're even there to watch Endgame and they didn't know.
[02:39:00.562 --> 02:39:03.864]  And they looked mad, and they looked scared, and they looked upset, and they looked angry all at the same time.
[02:39:05.145 --> 02:39:13.631]  And my dad looked unhappy, and he said, it's a very upsetting film, it's very well done, and he goes, it's very upsetting.
[02:39:14.351 --> 02:39:18.054]  And everybody looked shaken, and everybody looked upset, and that's good.
[02:39:20.197 --> 02:39:21.398]  Because this is a dark film.
[02:39:21.418 --> 02:39:22.479]  This is real.
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:28.264]  This isn't some fake horror movie where there's a bad guy running around who wants to saw your arms and legs off.
[02:39:28.624 --> 02:39:37.792]  These are people in control, running things, who want to kill you and your family, who want to disease you, who want to sterilize you, who want to hurt you.
[02:39:39.613 --> 02:39:42.475]  And I had a really nice police officer, good-looking couple, come over.
[02:39:42.816 --> 02:39:43.877]  He and his girlfriend or wife.
[02:39:43.937 --> 02:39:46.098]  And he's like, hey man, we're not all bad.
[02:39:46.178 --> 02:39:47.059]  I appreciate you.
[02:39:47.099 --> 02:39:47.860]  I'm a San Antonio cop.
[02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:49.001]  I'm like, hey, I appreciate you.
[02:39:50.143 --> 02:39:57.608]  But think about being me, a citizen, and seeing the Bill of Rights go away, and running into bad cops, and knowing history, and that tyranny will come to my door in a uniform.
[02:39:58.448 --> 02:40:02.050]  I begin at a primitive level to get very antagonistic and very angry.
[02:40:02.310 --> 02:40:04.312]  And I probably shoot myself in the foot doing that.
[02:40:04.712 --> 02:40:06.313]  But I wear my heart on my sleeve.
[02:40:06.353 --> 02:40:07.474]  I don't put on axe here.
[02:40:07.514 --> 02:40:09.595]  I don't pre-script what I'm going to do.
[02:40:11.838 --> 02:40:16.461]  And so, I mean, I read about, and I interview the people that turn out to be listeners.
[02:40:16.941 --> 02:40:22.885]  The cop comes up and says, you can't have an upside-down flag on your house, and he knocks the door down and beats them up, and then charges them on top of it.
[02:40:22.905 --> 02:40:24.026]  And I see this all the time.
[02:40:24.506 --> 02:40:26.427]  It's scary to know.
[02:40:27.128 --> 02:40:38.395]  And I only want you, as police officers, to have good husbands and wives, and to have happy children, and to make money, and go on nice vacations, and you know, watercolor, and you know, whatever you do, go fishing.
[02:40:39.432 --> 02:40:40.553]  I mean, I want you to do good.
[02:40:40.633 --> 02:40:41.573]  I'm a nice guy.
[02:40:43.254 --> 02:40:47.337]  I don't want to be your enemy, but you make yourself the enemy of the people when you do this stuff.
[02:40:47.677 --> 02:40:48.877]  And it's incremental.
[02:40:48.957 --> 02:40:51.039]  It's by degrees you're being brought into evil.
[02:40:59.023 --> 02:41:05.747]  And I want everybody to know about Endgame that this is not what I even sought out to make.
[02:41:08.507 --> 02:41:18.491]  I said, we're going to make a film about the Bilderberg Group and the elite and their agenda, and we'll cover the roads for taxation, the regionalization, how they want to have a carbon tax, and how they're into eugenics and want to reduce our numbers.
[02:41:19.091 --> 02:41:21.112]  And half the film became eugenics.
[02:41:21.152 --> 02:41:22.272]  I mean, really, it's three films.
[02:41:22.332 --> 02:41:24.953]  It's such an amazing documentary.
[02:41:25.733 --> 02:41:27.114]  I mean, I wanted your feedback today.
[02:41:27.154 --> 02:41:29.154]  Nobody called in with feedback who saw it last night.
[02:41:29.175 --> 02:41:30.335]  I guess you probably couldn't get through.
[02:41:32.054 --> 02:41:34.417]  Well, the off chance you can is I take these calls real fast.
[02:41:34.437 --> 02:41:34.818]  You can call 1-800-259-9231.
[02:41:34.838 --> 02:41:35.238]  800-259-9231 and get in.
[02:41:35.258 --> 02:41:37.581]  I mean, I want to hear it if you don't think it's good.
[02:41:37.601 --> 02:41:39.984]  I think... Yeah, I know it's my most highly produced, most expensive film I've made.
[02:41:48.072 --> 02:42:03.700]  It covers the history of the global elite, it shows the Bilderberg Group in Canada, then we show the Trans-Texas Corridor and the takeover of the roads and the NAFTA system, then we show the history of mass murder by governments, then eugenics, then transhumanists, and then we go back to Istanbul.
[02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:11.164]  People are like, my gosh, and ten minutes at the end of Jim Tucker just a few months ago in Istanbul, and secret police following him and everything else.
[02:42:12.445 --> 02:42:14.846]  I mean, it's quite an epic, and I really want your feedback.
[02:42:14.926 --> 02:42:16.507]  I want your emails of what you thought of it.
[02:42:17.776 --> 02:42:19.417]  Because I put 15 months into this.
[02:42:19.817 --> 02:42:20.097]  Okay.
[02:42:21.357 --> 02:42:31.599]  It's just to be there with a mass of people and to see them learn that they were the victims of a bioweapon.
[02:42:32.860 --> 02:42:33.340]  Oh yeah!
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:35.680]  And then there was this fellow who I think I've seen at events.
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:39.061]  He knew my wife, too, because our children went to the same school.
[02:42:39.961 --> 02:42:41.002]  A little tutor school.
[02:42:41.122 --> 02:42:42.202]  It was like twice a week.
[02:42:43.642 --> 02:42:46.123]  And he had the gubernatorial cowboy boots and everything.
[02:42:47.129 --> 02:42:49.710]  And he was one of Rick Perry's high-level people.
[02:42:49.770 --> 02:42:52.630]  He said, listen, I've been in there 10 years, blah, blah, blah.
[02:42:52.710 --> 02:42:54.571]  But we like you.
[02:42:54.591 --> 02:42:57.952]  And I know he went to Turkey, and blah, blah, blah.
[02:42:58.312 --> 02:43:08.854]  Because I just want to tell you, back when I was a medic, before I joined, I guess, then Lieutenant Governor and then Governor's staff, I was a medic at Fort Sam Houston.
[02:43:08.874 --> 02:43:13.835]  And they sent us these guys to be given out of Fort Sill, I think he said.
[02:43:13.855 --> 02:43:16.336]  Well, I didn't get his number and name.
[02:43:17.219 --> 02:43:17.759]  And have him on.
[02:43:17.779 --> 02:43:18.620]  I bet he wouldn't come on, though.
[02:43:19.321 --> 02:43:20.822]  And I hear about this all the time.
[02:43:20.842 --> 02:43:22.503]  This is the millionth time I've heard this.
[02:43:22.523 --> 02:43:23.344]  It's an exaggeration.
[02:43:23.364 --> 02:43:23.924]  The 500th time.
[02:43:24.004 --> 02:43:25.365]  I mean, it just never ends.
[02:43:25.765 --> 02:43:26.386]  Figure of speech.
[02:43:28.087 --> 02:43:33.191]  He was just hearing about what vaccines had done for everybody.
[02:43:33.571 --> 02:43:34.472]  He was a medic there.
[02:43:34.832 --> 02:43:36.774]  And these guys were deployed.
[02:43:37.034 --> 02:43:37.514]  Sit down.
[02:43:37.534 --> 02:43:38.275]  There's six of them.
[02:43:38.295 --> 02:43:40.196]  I think he said special ops.
[02:43:40.637 --> 02:43:42.138]  To be given meningitis shots.
[02:43:42.933 --> 02:43:46.454]  They gave all six the shots, and they all died within a couple days.
[02:43:46.734 --> 02:43:52.276]  Then they had them put on masks, scrub the whole place, pull it all out, and all the medics thought it was a bioweapons test.
[02:43:52.376 --> 02:43:54.857]  And I mean, they killed those guys right in front of them.
[02:43:58.318 --> 02:44:03.179]  And see, that's why people on Rick Perry's staff know the truth.
[02:44:03.199 --> 02:44:05.300]  Because they watch people die.
[02:44:10.922 --> 02:44:12.202]  They watch people die, folks.
[02:44:12.222 --> 02:44:13.223]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[02:44:15.103 --> 02:44:18.344]  We just watched a film where they just trot troops in and nerve gas them and kill them.
[02:44:18.444 --> 02:44:19.265]  U.S.-British troops.
[02:44:19.465 --> 02:44:21.225]  They don't care about you police.
[02:44:22.026 --> 02:44:23.566]  They don't care about any of us.
[02:44:24.887 --> 02:44:26.427]  That's the point I'm trying to make to you.
[02:44:26.667 --> 02:44:28.088]  You better be on our side.
[02:44:28.128 --> 02:44:29.328]  You better want to be with us.
[02:44:30.689 --> 02:44:32.229]  The state doesn't care about you.
[02:44:33.509 --> 02:44:35.090]  Alright, I'm going to shut up and go to calls.
[02:44:36.010 --> 02:44:37.171]  Mark in Philly.
[02:44:37.191 --> 02:44:37.731]  Thanks for holding.
[02:44:37.751 --> 02:44:38.051]  Go ahead.
[02:44:39.495 --> 02:45:02.991]  Hi Alex, first I'd like to in remembrance of Aaron Russo, when I would hear him speak on your show I could just hear the love and kindness that the Lord had put in his heart for people and I think we should remember that and to honor that to continue
[02:45:06.656 --> 02:45:12.117]  In his work and what he was doing alongside of your work.
[02:45:14.278 --> 02:45:17.659]  Secondly, I have a question you probably can answer.
[02:45:17.679 --> 02:45:28.281]  I have a friend who's a political activist, but he doesn't believe an inside job happened.
[02:45:28.301 --> 02:45:35.083]  And when I talked to him about the towers coming down at almost free-fall speed and so forth, he says he
[02:45:36.172 --> 02:45:44.876]  Saw the architect of those buildings who said he wished he had built those buildings stronger.
[02:45:45.156 --> 02:45:45.436]  Nope.
[02:45:46.937 --> 02:45:48.097]  The architect died.
[02:45:48.157 --> 02:45:49.718]  He's Nomura Yamasaki.
[02:45:50.018 --> 02:45:52.039]  Was designed to have two large jets in it.
[02:45:52.948 --> 02:45:59.172]  And also they had the building supervising engineer, Italian last name, forget his name, talk about how it could do that.
[02:45:59.732 --> 02:46:03.134]  And, I mean, they can have all sorts of fakes up on TV to convince people.
[02:46:03.394 --> 02:46:05.595]  Why don't you give him Operation Northwest, the official U.S.
[02:46:05.636 --> 02:46:06.996]  government plan to carry out the attack?
[02:46:07.457 --> 02:46:11.619]  Or the declassified documents where they admit that the Gulf of Tonkin was staged?
[02:46:11.899 --> 02:46:13.600]  Or how the USS Liberty was staged?
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.062]  Or how Operation Gladio was staged?
[02:46:16.082 --> 02:46:21.705]  That's how you really see that all these, and I appreciate your call, all these national TV shows, and I appreciate your kind words for Aaron,
[02:46:22.225 --> 02:46:24.986]  All these TV shows I've been on, they never let me talk about that.
[02:46:25.006 --> 02:46:25.747]  That never makes it.
[02:46:27.307 --> 02:46:30.048]  See, the fact that governments do this, why they do it.
[02:46:30.488 --> 02:46:33.009]  See, first you have to understand that, then move on from there.
[02:46:34.110 --> 02:46:35.310]  Building 7, they blew it up.
[02:46:35.370 --> 02:46:36.111]  Everybody saw it.
[02:46:36.191 --> 02:46:37.991]  I mean, they can debate and lie all day.
[02:46:38.011 --> 02:46:42.213]  I mean, they get on television and say cell phones work at 50,000 feet.
[02:46:42.733 --> 02:46:43.974]  They don't work at 2,000 feet.
[02:46:44.674 --> 02:46:47.735]  But they say, now they might say they work on Pluto.
[02:46:47.895 --> 02:46:51.617]  I mean, you know, they may say they work 15 trillion miles away.
[02:46:52.751 --> 02:46:57.916]  They may say leprechauns and Easter bunnies, you know, are at the end of every rainbow with a pot of gold.
[02:46:58.277 --> 02:47:00.679]  Look, it isn't true, okay?
[02:47:00.699 --> 02:47:02.140]  And we've gone through the evidence and shown that.
[02:47:02.341 --> 02:47:03.662]  We're offering a new video, by the way.
[02:47:03.702 --> 02:47:04.403]  We just got it in.
[02:47:04.463 --> 02:47:08.507]  It just came out two days ago.
[02:47:11.890 --> 02:47:14.493]  What an annoying ad we have on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:47:14.513 --> 02:47:15.594]  It's that tribal fusion.
[02:47:16.317 --> 02:47:18.038]  And it's those little funny faces that talk.
[02:47:18.058 --> 02:47:22.260]  It almost looks like they have a heart attack every time I hit refresh on a page and they go, hello!
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:23.760]  And I was like, who's in the room?
[02:47:23.780 --> 02:47:26.802]  I was like, um, what was I talking about just now?
[02:47:28.923 --> 02:47:32.785]  You know, they got those banners that talk to you on the web and then one pops up and you're like, what?
[02:47:33.645 --> 02:47:36.026]  Um, that totally distracted me.
[02:47:36.066 --> 02:47:36.887]  What was I talking about?
[02:47:36.927 --> 02:47:37.887]  It doesn't matter anymore.
[02:47:38.327 --> 02:47:39.388]  Fine, the government's good.
[02:47:39.408 --> 02:47:39.948]  Just trust them.
[02:47:42.492 --> 02:47:47.814]  I mean, when you sit there and talk to your friend, there are people who want any excuse to not believe the truth.
[02:47:49.454 --> 02:47:50.274]  Hitler talked about it.
[02:47:50.315 --> 02:47:52.015]  Goebbels talked about propaganda to be good.
[02:47:52.035 --> 02:47:56.256]  He should be simple and speak to their own innate laziness.
[02:47:58.317 --> 02:48:00.018]  But I would just give him Terror Storm.
[02:48:00.278 --> 02:48:03.399]  I really think Terror Storm is the most effective 9-11 film.
[02:48:03.439 --> 02:48:07.560]  There are some that you could say are more cinematic or more entertaining, a little bit maybe.
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:10.761]  But Terror Storm walks through the admissions.
[02:48:12.492 --> 02:48:15.695]  And Terror Storm shows you how there's a drill every time there's a terror attack.
[02:48:16.255 --> 02:48:18.277]  Of the exact same target at the exact same time.
[02:48:18.777 --> 02:48:20.979]  And how that's one in twenty-something truck to Gillian.
[02:48:24.482 --> 02:48:24.802]  Okay?
[02:48:27.304 --> 02:48:29.466]  Alright, I'm gonna try to get to everybody on the other side.
[02:48:29.906 --> 02:48:36.172]  Colton, Jim, Dan, John, get ready.
[02:48:36.312 --> 02:48:37.733]  I'm going right to you on the other side.
[02:48:37.753 --> 02:48:38.834]  I have your questions or comments.
[02:48:38.914 --> 02:48:39.134]  Ready?
[02:48:39.414 --> 02:48:41.276]  We'll go through you like rapid fire.
[02:48:48.721 --> 02:48:54.170]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.550 --> 02:49:02.142]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:09.913]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.313 --> 02:49:21.738]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.058 --> 02:49:25.580]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.020 --> 02:49:27.981]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.281 --> 02:49:32.063]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:45.345 --> 02:50:49.386]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:50:49.606 --> 02:50:53.007]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:50:53.187 --> 02:50:56.688]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:50:56.928 --> 02:51:00.188]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:51:00.208 --> 02:51:05.670]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:51:05.690 --> 02:51:10.931]  When we do our programs, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[02:51:11.572 --> 02:51:11.973]  Thank you.
[02:51:22.654 --> 02:51:27.178]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:51:27.258 --> 02:51:28.620]  It'll work on other problems as well.

[02:52:09.287 --> 02:52:10.127]  Alright!
[02:52:10.167 --> 02:52:10.708]  We're back!
[02:52:10.728 --> 02:52:12.749]  Colton, in British Columbia.
[02:52:12.849 --> 02:52:14.889]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:52:15.270 --> 02:52:17.290]  Hey Alex, good to hear from you.
[02:52:17.350 --> 02:52:26.074]  I just wanted to mention two individuals that I thought would be really good to have on your show.
[02:52:38.464 --> 02:52:41.326]  One guy's name is Mike Murray.
[02:52:41.427 --> 02:52:45.009]  He created a video that you can find online called Hacking the Mind.
[02:52:45.630 --> 02:52:57.038]  And he's actually a computer programmer slash hacker who's figured out ways how to use hypnosis to actually hack into people's mind to put in program thoughts, like of course the government has been able to do.
[02:52:57.478 --> 02:53:02.442]  And he's actually been able to find examples of exactly how to do it and how it's actually done.
[02:53:03.024 --> 02:53:07.447]  And a lot of politicians and people in the government are actually using that.
[02:53:07.807 --> 02:53:12.250]  Oh yeah, they're definitely pre-programming people to then resist certain ideas when they hear them.
[02:53:12.270 --> 02:53:12.850]  That's admitted.
[02:53:12.870 --> 02:53:14.451]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:53:14.491 --> 02:53:20.014]  But this actually finds out a way, like he describes exactly how to do it and how it's accomplished.
[02:53:20.494 --> 02:53:27.298]  And if you find out how you can accomplish something from a programmer's perspective, because I'm also a programmer, usually you can find a way to undo it.
[02:53:27.699 --> 02:53:28.879]  Yeah, that's finding the key.
[02:53:28.939 --> 02:53:29.880]  That's cracking it.
[02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:31.420]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:53:31.861 --> 02:53:35.342]  And the other individual, his name is Mark Stevens.
[02:53:35.523 --> 02:53:38.384]  He actually wrote a book called Adventures in Legal Land.
[02:53:38.444 --> 02:53:39.264]  We've had Mark on.
[02:53:39.284 --> 02:53:40.525]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:53:40.765 --> 02:53:41.666]  I've got to jump here.
[02:53:42.006 --> 02:53:42.806]  Thank you so much.
[02:53:43.086 --> 02:53:45.067]  We'll probably have both those guys on.
[02:53:45.147 --> 02:53:49.369]  I don't know the first one, but I certainly know Mark, and I was just thinking the other day, I should get Mark back on.
[02:53:49.409 --> 02:53:50.190]  He's quite a character.
[02:53:51.090 --> 02:53:53.652]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:53:54.552 --> 02:53:56.693]  Let's go ahead, and is it Tim or Jim?
[02:53:58.034 --> 02:53:58.834]  Tim in Ohio.
[02:53:58.854 --> 02:53:59.955]  You're on the air, and then Dan.
[02:53:59.975 --> 02:54:00.275]  Go ahead.
[02:54:01.109 --> 02:54:23.480]  Yeah, I just wanted to say that I can, like, completely relate to, uh, Christina Abrasol's experience with the, uh, driver that she had, because I-I-I've just had so much weird stuff that's happened to me in, like, the past couple years that some of them have had to do with 9-11, but I think some of them are just, like, signs from God.
[02:54:23.601 --> 02:54:29.604]  Like, for example, in my bathroom, like, my clock has literally stopped at 9-11.
[02:54:30.976 --> 02:54:39.261]  And I've, um, I've listened to some music, and when I was in that specific music piece, I thought about 9-11.
[02:54:39.602 --> 02:54:43.864]  And then someone goes and makes a music video out of it about the World Trade Centers.
[02:54:44.365 --> 02:54:45.005]  It's amazing.
[02:54:45.085 --> 02:54:46.146]  I gotta, I gotta jump here.
[02:54:46.166 --> 02:54:47.066]  We're almost out of time.
[02:54:47.086 --> 02:54:50.268]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to Dan in British Columbia.
[02:54:50.308 --> 02:54:50.949]  Go ahead, Dan.
[02:54:51.529 --> 02:54:52.950]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:54:53.691 --> 02:54:55.952]  Uh, I had some friends come up to visit me from the U.S.
[02:54:55.972 --> 02:55:00.335]  because I, of course, I used to live in the U.S., but, um, and one, they're flying in.
[02:55:01.099 --> 02:55:04.061]  And one of my friends went to apply for his passport.
[02:55:04.101 --> 02:55:07.283]  This was like back in June or something like that.
[02:55:07.944 --> 02:55:10.786]  And he went to the office there.
[02:55:10.806 --> 02:55:12.267]  I think it was the post office or something.
[02:55:12.847 --> 02:55:16.430]  And he was like, well, you know, this might take too long to get to me.
[02:55:18.271 --> 02:55:19.712]  Maybe I'll just like not get it.
[02:55:19.732 --> 02:55:25.496]  And the lady was like, well, you should go ahead and get it anyway, because you're going to need it to travel.
[02:55:26.969 --> 02:55:28.110]  Um, here in the U.S.
[02:55:28.270 --> 02:55:28.770]  Yeah, no, no.
[02:55:28.810 --> 02:55:33.752]  They have announced that to go, to walk down the street, to be on a park, to be, to go on a plane.
[02:55:33.772 --> 02:55:34.812]  That was mainstream news.
[02:55:34.932 --> 02:55:38.294]  Uh, the head of, the head of Homeland Security said that two weeks ago.
[02:55:38.954 --> 02:55:40.254]  We've been telling everybody this for years.
[02:55:40.655 --> 02:55:42.055]  Ron Paul told us two years ago.
[02:55:42.115 --> 02:55:42.875]  It's in the bill.
[02:55:42.915 --> 02:55:43.516]  They passed it.
[02:55:44.256 --> 02:55:47.237]  Uh, we are now completely federalized under martial law.
[02:55:47.697 --> 02:55:54.100]  Congress has been removed from continuity of government and it's been handed over to United Nations control.
[02:55:55.107 --> 02:55:59.809]  And that was a whole stack of news we didn't even get to today, but we did cover it Monday or Tuesday and Sunday.
[02:56:00.910 --> 02:56:02.831]  It's just, it's all off the charts.
[02:56:02.951 --> 02:56:08.253]  I mean, it's just, now that doesn't mean they fully implemented it now, but they're saying, hey, you can't protest.
[02:56:08.813 --> 02:56:10.054]  Hey, you can't do this.
[02:56:10.134 --> 02:56:12.375]  Hey, we're going to arrest you because you didn't submit to a search.
[02:56:13.415 --> 02:56:15.336]  Hey, you can't have that flag upside down.
[02:56:16.657 --> 02:56:20.198]  We're going to go ahead and arrest you and it's foreign troops in our military now.
[02:56:20.598 --> 02:56:21.579]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:56:21.619 --> 02:56:22.359]  We're out of time.
[02:56:22.379 --> 02:56:23.219]  Sorry to the other callers.
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:24.160]  God bless you all.
