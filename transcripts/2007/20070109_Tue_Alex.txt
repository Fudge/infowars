[00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:01.370]  I'm great.
[00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.883]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:32.923 --> 00:00:36.349]  Big Brother
[00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:42.697]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:43.438 --> 00:00:44.559]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.001]  You want answers?
[00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:47.762]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:48.323 --> 00:00:51.946]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:52.527 --> 00:00:56.611]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.122]  We have a very important guest joining us today.
[00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:18.368]  He's the father of a serviceman who has refused to be redeployed to Iraq because he's stating on the record that he will not follow illegal orders.
[00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.232]  And so we'll be talking to the serviceman's father coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:23.372 --> 00:01:35.200]  In the meantime, I want to play an O'Reilly Factor clip to break down and analyze the low-grade, moron-level propaganda that O'Reilly uses.
[00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:38.364]  But that's why he's so effective.
[00:01:38.404 --> 00:01:48.070]  He's playing to that 40 to 50 percent of the American population who literally are mind-numbed robots.
[00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.395]  They literally just watch television, go to work, and believe whatever the media and the government say.
[00:01:56.934 --> 00:02:03.439]  Because, I mean, I don't watch a lot of television, but I do watch little news clips of key commentators and track the information.
[00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:11.544]  So I watch a few clips of O'Reilly every week, and he's getting more and more mindless, more and more simplistic.
[00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:23.233]  I mean, they could basically have a robot doll that would just sit there and say, you're an idiot, you're a kook, you're a minority, no one agrees with you, you're a kook, you're an idiot, you're a moron.
[00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.810]  You're a very small group.
[00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.271]  The American people hate you.
[00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:28.652]  You're a terrorist.
[00:02:28.672 --> 00:02:29.852]  You support terrorists.
[00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:32.574]  That's all he says.
[00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:35.115]  What's he get paid?
[00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:38.858]  Like ten million dollars a year to just sit there and repeat that?
[00:02:39.838 --> 00:02:40.679]  It's unbelievable.
[00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:42.600]  Then we have another clip.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.661]  Lou Dobbs on fire last night.
[00:02:45.663 --> 00:02:51.285]  Saying they're bringing in one world government, that it's a new world order, and the destruction of the U.S.
[00:02:51.305 --> 00:03:01.088]  Because a new report was issued yesterday by the Globalist saying we're not done with the North American Union, they want to go ahead and merge it now into the Pan American Union.
[00:03:01.908 --> 00:03:14.752]  So, for a year and a half we've been inside the North American Union, now they're already trying to merge it into the Pan American Union, but they've got to kill Hugo Chavez first, which they've been trying to do, so we'll see what happens there.
[00:03:14.792 --> 00:03:15.252]  But I'll tell you,
[00:03:15.936 --> 00:03:31.721]  It feels really good to have major newspapers and people like Lou Dobbs reporting the truth, because it's shocking and amazing mind-numbed robots, the brainwashed type out there, who believe whatever's on TV, just not, anything we talk about isn't true.
[00:03:32.682 --> 00:03:42.385]  Okay, but then as soon as it's on television it must be true, and they're literally having problems computing right now, because the White House admits we're a North American Union,
[00:03:43.107 --> 00:03:45.508]  The documents are there and available.
[00:03:45.988 --> 00:03:47.568]  It is now getting out to the public.
[00:03:48.188 --> 00:03:55.349]  And it is making people out there take a double-take because, wait a minute, he told the truth about the amnesty program.
[00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.030]  He told the truth about the North American Union.
[00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.530]  He told the truth about so many other issues.
[00:04:01.611 --> 00:04:05.251]  And now he's telling the truth about this.
[00:04:05.691 --> 00:04:08.292]  You see, so many people won't check out my claims.
[00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:13.392]  And so for years, they'll just think I'm up here making this stuff up.
[00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:18.435]  Believe me, I wish every day that I was making this up.
[00:04:18.495 --> 00:04:19.056]  We're not.
[00:04:19.796 --> 00:04:21.998]  We don't have words to describe how serious it is.
[00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.100]  The neocons attacked Somalia yesterday.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.582]  Anybody they attack is called Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:37.570]  Also, a really scary report here out of the Austin American-Statesman that I missed, and it was also picked up by UPI, this came out a few weeks ago,
[00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:48.369]  And it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, a headline, mishap in dismantling nuclear warhead, warhead almost detonates in Texas.
[00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:57.232]  Again, none of us can track or follow all the news, but we'll, and you can bet your bottom dollar.
[00:04:58.004 --> 00:05:06.490]  That when there is a mishap at a nuclear plant or at a nuclear weapons facility, it's going to be blamed on shadowy Al-Qaeda groups when it's an accident.
[00:05:06.891 --> 00:05:09.292]  That's a whole other level of tyranny.
[00:05:12.595 --> 00:05:16.058]  The Democrats are not really challenging Bush's expansion war plan.
[00:05:16.418 --> 00:05:17.379]  We'll break that down.
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.883]  It's a very important broadcast that we have lined up for you today.
[00:05:23.023 --> 00:05:24.384]  I really hope you'll stay with us.

[00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:39.775]  It's here.
[00:05:39.915 --> 00:05:44.696]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:45.076 --> 00:05:52.718]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:53.422 --> 00:06:00.464]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:00.865 --> 00:06:12.268]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:16.110]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.511]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:22.672]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:36.138 --> 00:06:41.382]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:06:41.522 --> 00:06:49.608]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:56.493]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:06:56.493 --> 00:06:57.334]  We're good to go!
[00:07:31.382 --> 00:07:40.070]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.853]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:48.137]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[00:07:51.172 --> 00:07:52.493]  I made a perfect nightlight.
[00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:54.555]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[00:07:54.935 --> 00:08:00.180]  SoleilWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:06.525]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[00:08:06.805 --> 00:08:08.527]  I figured it would clean really well.
[00:08:08.767 --> 00:08:11.970]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.073]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[00:08:16.314 --> 00:08:17.775]  Plus, the service was great.
[00:08:18.115 --> 00:08:23.239]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit SoleilWellness.com.
[00:08:23.299 --> 00:08:26.442]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness dot com.
[00:08:26.602 --> 00:08:29.504]  Or call 312-224-2710.
[00:08:29.524 --> 00:08:33.127]  312-224-2710.
[00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:43.475]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:44.096 --> 00:08:47.058]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:50.487 --> 00:08:55.889]  Alright, we've got a big broadcast lined up for you today, now eight minutes into the second segment here.
[00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:06.174]  We have the father of the Hawaiian-American who is refusing to be redeployed to Iraq because he believes it's an illegal war.
[00:09:06.194 --> 00:09:07.794]  I commend his stand.
[00:09:07.815 --> 00:09:08.875]  He's being court-martialed.
[00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:11.656]  His father will be joining us in the second hour.
[00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:15.718]  I also want to play a clip of a Riley grilling
[00:09:16.942 --> 00:09:20.264]  Some poor lady who stands up to him and does an admirable job.
[00:09:20.304 --> 00:09:27.387]  And I wanted to walk through the different propaganda tactics that are used by O'Reilly.
[00:09:28.128 --> 00:09:34.051]  And we have, as I mentioned earlier, an incredible clip coming up at the bottom of the hour from Lou Dobbs on fire.
[00:09:34.451 --> 00:09:36.452]  This tops all the previous reports.
[00:09:37.205 --> 00:09:47.273]  About the North American slash Pan-American Union calling George Bush Senior and Bush Junior out and just point blank saying it's a New World Order plan.
[00:09:48.914 --> 00:09:52.156]  Even playing clips of Bush Senior saying New World Order.
[00:09:53.097 --> 00:09:56.179]  And there's no doubt that Lou Dobbs people watch and listen to the show.
[00:09:56.219 --> 00:10:05.366]  You know I've talked to some of the biggest producers at CNN and they tell me, oh we know it's a New World Order, oh we know what's happening but we're not allowed to
[00:10:06.053 --> 00:10:08.113]  Have you on and we're not allowed to tell the truth?
[00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:09.154]  Oh, we wish we could.
[00:10:09.974 --> 00:10:12.354]  And I've had Fox producers tell me that too.
[00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:23.936]  So understand, you got a lot of sociopaths or egomaniacs who are the news anchors and the people that get on television, who do what they do because they've sold their soul to the New World Order.
[00:10:24.396 --> 00:10:31.097]  But a lot of people behind the scenes are literally just taking a paycheck as mercenaries and hate their jobs.
[00:10:31.477 --> 00:10:34.538]  People ask, why, how come Lou Dobbs is allowed to do what he's doing?
[00:10:35.525 --> 00:10:49.317]  Back in the late 1990s, he was not given control, editorial control, and before he started going public about world government and doing an excellent show, I had already just picked up this factoid trivia.
[00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:59.707]  So I already knew this about Dobbs, that in the late to mid 1990s, it was about 97 or so, he got into a contract negotiation with CNN,
[00:11:01.056 --> 00:11:02.437]  And he wanted editorial control.
[00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:03.918]  Few have that.
[00:11:03.998 --> 00:11:05.659]  O'Reilly has that over his program.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.081]  And they wouldn't give it to him.
[00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:11.103]  Dobbs left and went and ran some internet company.
[00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:23.011]  And then at the end of the dot-com bust, what, in 2001 or 2002, he came back to CNN, but did get a contract where he controls his own show year to year.
[00:11:24.152 --> 00:11:28.875]  And so that's why you see him being able to talk about real issues.
[00:11:30.476 --> 00:11:35.038]  Of course, he now has the highest ratings on CNN, higher than Larry King Live.
[00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:39.440]  Same thing, highest ratings on MSNBC, Keith Olbermann.
[00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:49.805]  Now, I tend to think Dobbs is a better person, just analyzing him, assessing him, than Olbermann.
[00:11:49.885 --> 00:11:59.909]  Olbermann's more of a Democratic operative who I admire and I think has a lot of courage and has done a lot of good, but you notice he's kind of backed off now that Democrats are in power.
[00:12:00.658 --> 00:12:06.362]  He's not illustrating how they're going right along with the expansion and escalation of the war.
[00:12:07.783 --> 00:12:12.786]  And you notice Oberman always acts like it's Bush running things and Bush is doing things.
[00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:18.001]  And to be fair, Dobbs does that to a certain extent in this piece that's coming up.
[00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:23.004]  He talks about, oh no, this is the elite's New World Order.
[00:12:23.024 --> 00:12:28.607]  But then he goes on to elaborate, this is George Bush Senior's New World Order that Junior's carrying out.
[00:12:29.067 --> 00:12:31.308]  Junior's carrying out Daddy's plan.
[00:12:32.789 --> 00:12:37.912]  George Herbert Walker Bush was, in his own words, a Rockefeller Republican.
[00:12:38.952 --> 00:12:43.555]  And that's the agenda that he's carrying out.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:13:00.872]  And if you don't know what the Rockefeller agenda is, the stated agenda is to destroy the middle class, destroy our borders, destroy our sovereignty, disarm the American people, and have a one-child policy, just for starters.
[00:13:01.993 --> 00:13:11.481]  And again, the whole Rockefeller clan has written books, they fund hundreds of foundations and different front groups that push all of this.
[00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:13.182]  It's in triplicate.
[00:13:14.119 --> 00:13:21.220]  They're so arrogant, though, they know the average person doesn't spend their time reading Council on Foreign Relations policy papers.
[00:13:22.921 --> 00:13:26.321]  Or, you know, David Rockefeller's memoirs, 2003.
[00:13:27.901 --> 00:13:28.762]  But we do.
[00:13:29.322 --> 00:13:32.082]  And let me tell you, it is not pretty.
[00:13:33.742 --> 00:13:41.824]  Now, we've evidence, and more and more evidence has come out since we started reporting this about ten years ago, that Bill Clinton and the Bushes
[00:13:43.949 --> 00:14:06.759]  Bill Clinton was recruited in the late sixties in the CIA, just like it's now come out, in major British newspapers, admitted that Tony Blair, from the time he left high school, I mean, he was a freshman in college, and he was already M.I.5.
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.300]  Internal Security.
[00:14:10.561 --> 00:14:11.261]  That's on record.
[00:14:11.281 --> 00:14:12.202]  Just type Tony Blair M.I.5.
[00:14:14.042 --> 00:14:14.982]  Of course he was!
[00:14:15.122 --> 00:14:18.384]  I mean, they get these people out of high school!
[00:14:19.444 --> 00:14:19.844]  Okay?
[00:14:20.224 --> 00:14:21.545]  And that's why George Bush Sr.
[00:14:21.585 --> 00:14:22.905]  met 11 times with Bill Clinton.
[00:14:23.205 --> 00:14:24.006]  That's why Bush Sr.
[00:14:24.026 --> 00:14:25.967]  didn't really campaign in the 1992 election.
[00:14:27.757 --> 00:14:28.897]  That's why Bush Sr.
[00:14:30.778 --> 00:14:35.239]  now vacations with Clinton and all they do is worship each other and talk about how he's a member of the family.
[00:14:35.619 --> 00:14:40.820]  Because that guy has been handled by Bush Sr.
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.740]  and all the evidence, we know Bush Sr.
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:51.362]  was CIA, we know Clinton's CIA, but all the evidence shows he was handling him from the early 1970s on.
[00:14:52.863 --> 00:14:54.863]  And it's perfect for them.
[00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:57.199]  It's absolutely perfect.
[00:14:57.239 --> 00:15:11.904]  I mean, they can't just stay in office forever, have eight years of Bush, because that's really who was president with Ronald Reagan, and mainstream historians, and presidential, you know, even Kitty Kelly's written that.
[00:15:11.984 --> 00:15:16.006]  I mean, this is, that after Reagan got shot, especially, I mean, he didn't run anything.
[00:15:16.486 --> 00:15:23.548]  And then you got four more years of Bush, and then you got eight years of Clinton, and now you've gotten six, seven more years.
[00:15:24.209 --> 00:15:25.029]  How many years is that?
[00:15:25.169 --> 00:15:25.309]  Eight?
[00:15:26.664 --> 00:15:28.367]  And then four is twelve.
[00:15:28.387 --> 00:15:32.855]  And then we get eight more, that's twenty.
[00:15:32.875 --> 00:15:35.619]  And then we get six more.
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.568]  Twenty-six years as president.
[00:15:42.188 --> 00:15:43.488]  George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:15:43.548 --> 00:15:58.331]  I mean, if anybody is running things from 1980 until now, if anybody's got more influence over the puppet power seat, it is George Herbert Walker Bush, who is a total tool of the Rockefeller family.
[00:15:59.671 --> 00:16:00.411]  Brags about it.
[00:16:00.971 --> 00:16:03.112]  Says, I'm a Rockefeller Republican.
[00:16:05.932 --> 00:16:09.493]  And now they've got Jeb on the wings, they've got Hillary totally bought and paid for.
[00:16:10.299 --> 00:16:11.700]  I mean, just look at how they operate.
[00:16:12.081 --> 00:16:16.945]  And of course, remember, four and a half years ago, they set up the 9-11 whitewash commission?
[00:16:16.965 --> 00:16:21.309]  You know, they were announcing they were going to have it the next year, and they said, an independent voice!
[00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:22.270]  Independent!
[00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.752]  It's Henry Kissinger!
[00:16:24.872 --> 00:16:25.733]  Come on down!
[00:16:25.813 --> 00:16:28.295]  People went, wait a minute.
[00:16:31.218 --> 00:16:34.501]  This guy's the real power behind the throne, given the Bush's orders.
[00:16:34.901 --> 00:16:35.762]  Rothschild agent.
[00:16:37.515 --> 00:16:46.579]  Well, wait a minute, he's the big Harvard triple PhD, which he only gave to a few people who then sit in that seat of power as a top-level manager for the globalists.
[00:16:47.679 --> 00:17:03.806]  And it turns out that Bush's entire administration, every week, whether it's the ranch, or whether it's Washington, or if history has to fly to a foreign country, if Bush is there, every week they go into a closed room for upwards of two hours.
[00:17:05.828 --> 00:17:07.089]  That just came out a few months ago.
[00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:09.670]  That they meet every week!
[00:17:13.871 --> 00:17:18.533]  And Henry Kissinger tells him exactly what to do.
[00:17:21.614 --> 00:17:23.535]  And boy, does he do it.
[00:17:27.517 --> 00:17:28.717]  It's amazing.
[00:17:29.177 --> 00:17:31.818]  And then a few months ago, a few weeks ago, was that a month ago?
[00:17:32.099 --> 00:17:35.360]  We play a clip of Dick Cheney at the CFR.
[00:17:37.484 --> 00:17:59.380]  Saying that he was co-chairman in the past, and that he kept it secret from his constituents, ha ha ha, and people email and they post to the message board under the video clip saying it's a fake video, or saying, oh, he was joking, he hates David Rockefeller, he fights the New World Order.
[00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:06.786]  I mean, you guys are delusional to the extreme that believe that, and that's the type of stuff we deal with.
[00:18:07.654 --> 00:18:27.962]  We've got David Rockefeller, Dick Cheney, all these people openly destroying our country before our very eyes, and you tell somebody whose car is festooned with Bush stickers and Condio 8 stickers, that, and they'll probably agree with us on most issues, but they just cannot compute it.
[00:18:28.442 --> 00:18:29.922]  They cannot get it.
[00:18:30.603 --> 00:18:31.763]  They will not get it.
[00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:38.936]  Controlling this government means you control tens of trillions of dollars a year.
[00:18:39.896 --> 00:18:51.961]  Now, do you think major global corporations are going to leave that type of wealth and power in the hands of the people, or are they going to attempt by hook or by crook, with every energy they've got, to get control of government?
[00:18:52.161 --> 00:18:53.202]  That's the biggest business!
[00:18:53.222 --> 00:19:00.605]  It isn't making computers, it isn't pharmaceuticals, it isn't making cars, it isn't making highways, it isn't education,
[00:19:01.463 --> 00:19:11.788]  The biggest industry is lobbying and getting corporate welfare and now getting governmental power signed over to your corporation by the government.
[00:19:13.429 --> 00:19:13.889]  It's simple.
[00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:20.733]  The defense contractors owned by the central banks are simply making themselves our occupiers by law.
[00:19:22.521 --> 00:19:36.029]  And they got 20 TV shows that mimic torture and secret arrest and make the people doing it all heroes and weak-minded America watches it and is having their souls warped right now to accept all of this.
[00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:43.553]  And the minute they think they can greenlight and go with it, they are going to start going around and having gunfights with people and arresting people and rounding them up.
[00:19:43.613 --> 00:19:47.395]  I mean, that is... Look, anywhere they're able to, they do it.
[00:19:47.616 --> 00:19:47.876]  Okay?
[00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:49.997]  Our government funded MAL to do it.
[00:19:50.763 --> 00:19:52.063]  David Rockefeller in 76.
[00:19:52.183 --> 00:19:53.344]  I ought to go pull that quote.
[00:19:53.384 --> 00:19:55.164]  It's in my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:19:55.244 --> 00:19:56.645]  I have the New York Times article.
[00:19:56.665 --> 00:20:00.046]  In fact, I've got to dig that out for the film I'm making.
[00:20:01.806 --> 00:20:02.406]  Just thought of that.
[00:20:02.426 --> 00:20:03.567]  There's so many points.
[00:20:04.327 --> 00:20:05.087]  Rockefeller, Mao.
[00:20:05.187 --> 00:20:06.108]  Let me write that down.
[00:20:09.489 --> 00:20:12.569]  And he says, oh, we love Mao.
[00:20:12.589 --> 00:20:13.710]  We love everything Mao did.
[00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.491]  Mao had killed 60 million people by then.
[00:20:19.225 --> 00:20:22.208]  So, if they can get away with it here, they'll do it.
[00:20:23.709 --> 00:20:24.550]  And you go, why?
[00:20:25.431 --> 00:20:28.754]  Why does Ted Bundy strangle women and bite big chunks out of them?
[00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:31.556]  Why does Jeffrey Dahmer fillet people?
[00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:34.939]  I mean, it's a question you need to answer.
[00:20:39.403 --> 00:20:41.345]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:20:41.846 --> 00:20:44.228]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:53.465]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:20:54.425 --> 00:20:59.327]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:09.949]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:21:10.429 --> 00:21:12.690]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:21:13.524 --> 00:21:14.865]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:21:14.885 --> 00:21:14.925]  702-953-0267.

[00:21:15.985 --> 00:21:17.266]  That's www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:21:17.306 --> 00:21:19.106]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:46.536]  Did you know that one goal of international communism was to get our young people's mind off religion by getting along to sex?
[00:21:47.376 --> 00:21:57.125]  By destroying the morals of the younger generation, America would eventually become ripe for revolution without understanding why communism wanted to make young people soft and easily controlled.
[00:21:58.274 --> 00:22:03.338]  Have we witnessed this transformation of our young people away from God and the Bible to immorality?
[00:22:04.019 --> 00:22:11.905]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:14.167]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:14.187 --> 00:22:14.527]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:22.554 --> 00:22:27.020]  516-8736 to request your subscription.
[00:22:27.681 --> 00:22:28.241]  Call now.
[00:22:28.262 --> 00:22:31.125]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:22:33.937 --> 00:22:35.778]  Dad, can we stop?
[00:22:36.098 --> 00:22:37.638]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[00:22:38.038 --> 00:22:38.298]  What?
[00:22:38.659 --> 00:22:39.019]  Again?
[00:22:39.439 --> 00:22:41.059]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[00:22:41.119 --> 00:22:45.561]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:47.081]  Why did you do that?
[00:22:47.281 --> 00:22:53.083]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[00:22:53.363 --> 00:22:54.404]  Are we there yet?
[00:22:54.504 --> 00:22:55.564]  for the entire trip.
[00:22:55.824 --> 00:22:57.985]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[00:22:58.505 --> 00:22:59.527]  Great idea!
[00:22:59.788 --> 00:23:02.412]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids!
[00:23:02.753 --> 00:23:05.237]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:09.805]  And using our Berkey Sport Bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[00:23:10.105 --> 00:23:10.426]  Honey!
[00:23:11.215 --> 00:23:12.456]  You're terrific!
[00:23:12.856 --> 00:23:14.337]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[00:23:14.457 --> 00:23:17.858]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[00:23:18.138 --> 00:23:18.919]  Now can we stop?
[00:23:19.439 --> 00:23:20.160]  I need to go, too.
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.902]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:23:25.022 --> 00:23:25.322]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:23:25.342 --> 00:23:26.883]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.340]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:36.741 --> 00:23:42.222]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:23:42.802 --> 00:23:43.303]  That's right.
[00:23:43.623 --> 00:23:45.903]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:23:47.304 --> 00:23:53.386]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:23:53.946 --> 00:24:01.634]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:24:02.075 --> 00:24:06.940]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.583]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:24:13.366 --> 00:24:17.488]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:24:17.888 --> 00:24:18.128]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:24:18.148 --> 00:24:19.969]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:24:19.989 --> 00:24:20.249]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:24:20.289 --> 00:24:20.809]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:20.849 --> 00:24:21.850]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.251]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:57.756 --> 00:24:59.317]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:59.357 --> 00:25:11.424]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, that's just in about eight minutes or so, when we come out of break, I'm going to play this incredible, all kudos go to Lou Dobbs.
[00:25:11.504 --> 00:25:18.668]  And I want to analyze that clip and then also want to break down the opposite of Lou Dobbs, a man of courage and integrity.
[00:25:19.628 --> 00:25:23.490]  So you can just look at his eyes and tell he's legitimate, because he's feeling good what he's doing.
[00:25:24.251 --> 00:25:28.233]  Most of these pundits are just, they're not actually New World Order, they're just whores.
[00:25:28.833 --> 00:25:31.675]  And so they're getting off on the power, but they hate what they're doing.
[00:25:32.255 --> 00:25:39.179]  And you can look at the body language of Dobbs and tell, he's a good old boy, he's an establishment business guy, but he loves America!
[00:25:40.499 --> 00:25:42.320]  He doesn't want to kill this country!
[00:25:44.061 --> 00:25:47.183]  Every time I think about what they're doing to this country, I get mad, and I've got to
[00:25:48.052 --> 00:25:51.893]  Lately I've been having a lot of anger problems and for years I've not been able to control it.
[00:25:52.894 --> 00:25:56.835]  But it destroys my thinking process.
[00:25:57.215 --> 00:26:08.980]  I'm getting so mad on air about what's happening in this country that I tend to then lash out at other things and people around me and I'm not even talking about people that work for me.
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.280]  I'm a teddy bear.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.542]  I mean people I can't stand out in the community and just scum suckers and
[00:26:16.802 --> 00:26:19.124]  I just, we're in so much trouble.
[00:26:20.705 --> 00:26:23.947]  I mean, do you know what it means to go into a North American Union?
[00:26:24.307 --> 00:26:26.589]  It isn't just the end of the U.S.
[00:26:26.949 --> 00:26:29.330]  It's the end of your freedoms and your private property!
[00:26:31.532 --> 00:26:34.614]  And being completely overrun by third world populations.
[00:26:37.035 --> 00:26:40.518]  This is the jewel in the crown of the globalist operation.
[00:26:40.538 --> 00:26:41.318]  Let me tell you something.
[00:26:41.338 --> 00:26:42.439]  Overrunning our borders.
[00:26:44.432 --> 00:26:55.819]  And destroying our sovereignty is light years bigger and more important to the New World Order crowd than even invading Iraq was to secure that oil and to use it as a military base.
[00:26:58.161 --> 00:27:02.923]  Deindustrializing this country is something they've done militarily.
[00:27:04.685 --> 00:27:11.469]  Multinational corporations will bring in foodstuffs, fruits,
[00:27:12.782 --> 00:27:24.745]  From outside the country, Mexico, China, you name it, at higher prices to themselves than buying it domestically, just so they can extinct the American farmer.
[00:27:25.565 --> 00:27:27.585]  And they write policy reports about it!
[00:27:28.285 --> 00:27:29.446]  That's the incredible thing!
[00:27:29.486 --> 00:27:30.506]  That stuff's public!
[00:27:32.066 --> 00:27:33.746]  It's just their business strategy!
[00:27:35.047 --> 00:27:36.327]  Put people out of business!
[00:27:37.242 --> 00:27:38.542]  You go, well that's free market.
[00:27:38.983 --> 00:27:41.103]  No it's not when you're using slave goods.
[00:27:41.703 --> 00:27:50.366]  And you've got multinational corporations backed up by the big private central banks that control our central banks that literally issue the credit and literally print the money.
[00:27:50.406 --> 00:27:51.126]  You understand that?
[00:27:51.426 --> 00:27:52.526]  This is not free market.
[00:27:52.686 --> 00:27:57.548]  This is big private banks that paid off our politicians and took over our issuance of money.
[00:27:57.808 --> 00:28:06.370]  They then use the money they can create, unlimited, to go out and fund business operations to simply destroy their competition.
[00:28:07.057 --> 00:28:08.918]  It's like what Clear Channel does in radio.
[00:28:09.238 --> 00:28:11.720]  How they were able to buy, I don't know, 1600 radio stations.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.422]  They'd go into mid-sized towns and cities, and they admitted this.
[00:28:16.063 --> 00:28:29.051]  And they would, for a year, two years, three years, whatever it took, sell locals, local businesses, local dealerships, local restaurants, ads at sometimes $1 a piece.
[00:28:32.483 --> 00:28:38.285]  Now, the other radio station had to charge $20, $25, $30, $40 a piece just to stay open.
[00:28:39.645 --> 00:28:48.488]  Well, after a year or two, they all went under and went dark, turned off, and then Clear Channel didn't even have to buy them out.
[00:28:49.468 --> 00:28:50.308]  And then what do you get?
[00:28:50.548 --> 00:28:52.249]  You lost that local radio station.
[00:28:52.916 --> 00:28:58.518]  And now Clear Channel can charge you a hundred bucks in ad when you weren't paying twenty bucks in ad to that mom and pop.
[00:28:58.959 --> 00:29:07.802]  So you thought you were getting a real good deal up front early on, but you weren't getting a real good deal, were you?
[00:29:09.443 --> 00:29:11.023]  And it's like everything else they do.
[00:29:13.484 --> 00:29:19.387]  I mean, listen, when I go to the grocery store, my wife goes to the grocery store, there may be some pears or some oranges or
[00:29:20.117 --> 00:29:21.918]  Or some kind of squash we want.
[00:29:22.358 --> 00:29:25.999]  But if it doesn't say made in America, we don't get it.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.580]  Grown in America.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:34.122]  Now I buy a lot of foreign batteries and appliances, because you can't find them that are American made.
[00:29:34.342 --> 00:29:35.262]  It's almost impossible.
[00:29:35.762 --> 00:29:47.066]  But when it comes to food, did you know 2006 was the first year, I remember seeing this number last year, that that was going to be the year it flipped over.
[00:29:47.446 --> 00:29:49.527]  Then I was reminded listening to Derry Brownfield this morning.
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:30:00.085]  And I tuned in and they were talking about how this is the first year that we import more food than we export.
[00:30:00.105 --> 00:30:03.606]  It's shameful!
[00:30:04.267 --> 00:30:07.268]  The breadbasket of the world could feed the whole world!
[00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:12.311]  And they did this to us.
[00:30:13.758 --> 00:30:18.381]  Alright, I got a bunch of news, tons of clips, big guests coming up in the second hour.
[00:30:19.081 --> 00:30:21.963]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and I'm honored to be your host.
[00:30:22.343 --> 00:30:23.563]  Thank you for tuning in.
[00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:29.627]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:30.527 --> 00:30:33.229]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:36.181 --> 00:30:38.924]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[00:30:39.265 --> 00:30:45.753]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription filled.
[00:30:45.793 --> 00:30:47.775]  That's over 46% savings!
[00:30:48.135 --> 00:30:50.418]  The average savings for generic drugs was over 71%.
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:31:00.687]  RxDrugCard.com is the only major discount prescription drug plan that offers a price lookup page, so you can get an idea of your discounted price before you enroll.
[00:31:00.907 --> 00:31:04.290]  RxDrugCard.com is for anyone who pays for their own prescriptions.
[00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:09.274]  There are no age restrictions, all prescriptions are covered, and 95% of all pharmacies in the U.S.
[00:31:09.314 --> 00:31:13.377]  participate, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS Pharmacy, and many more.

[00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:20.523]  Membership fees start at only $4.50 per month.
[00:31:21.664 --> 00:31:22.285]  I think so.
[00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.611]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[00:31:37.931 --> 00:31:46.534]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[00:31:46.874 --> 00:31:52.636]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[00:31:53.017 --> 00:32:00.459]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.780]  Davis Products is offering
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:02.220]  We're good to go.

[00:32:32.895 --> 00:32:35.137]  That's Davis-Products.com.
[00:32:35.978 --> 00:32:38.359]  Attention, attention everyone!
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.901]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:32:40.981 --> 00:32:45.685]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[00:32:46.326 --> 00:32:53.151]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[00:32:53.692 --> 00:33:06.561]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[00:33:07.022 --> 00:33:11.004]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[00:33:11.465 --> 00:33:15.448]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and
[00:33:16.008 --> 00:33:21.534]  Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[00:33:21.915 --> 00:33:24.918]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[00:33:25.318 --> 00:33:26.540]  That's Wristease.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:31.926]  W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E Wristease.com.
[00:33:32.086 --> 00:33:34.709]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[00:34:01.596 --> 00:34:02.256]  Welcome back!
[00:34:02.316 --> 00:34:08.080]  Coming up in the next hour, we've got Robert Wattada, father of
[00:34:30.026 --> 00:34:33.568]  Lieutenant Watada, who's being court-martialed for refusing to be part of the criminal war.
[00:34:33.588 --> 00:34:46.497]  You know, for all you good old boys who think it's manly to go over there and kill some Arabs, some Persians, though you have trouble geographically finding a region with your, uh, with your ignorance.
[00:34:47.967 --> 00:34:56.530]  The very people running this war, the very people that have got our boys and now our girls, although they're dying, are the ones dismantling our border.
[00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:58.750]  Can you not compute that?
[00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:03.832]  This is a war for global corporations to seize oil and for weapons sales.
[00:35:05.212 --> 00:35:10.774]  This has nothing to do with our security and sovereignty.
[00:35:10.814 --> 00:35:17.536]  In fact, the Pentagon is quite cavalier about that fact in the P2OG memorandums and funding operation.
[00:35:18.377 --> 00:35:22.540]  It's covered by AP, UPI, Toronto Star, London Guardian.
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:34.947]  They say that the invasion will actually stimulate attacks and increase the number of, quote, terrorists, which is good because then that allows a spreading, widening conflict.
[00:35:37.169 --> 00:35:42.672]  And when this has come out on talk radio, the neocons go, we'll see, we're smoking out the terrorists!
[00:35:43.873 --> 00:35:47.735]  That's like somebody shooting your mother in the head to make you become a terrorist.
[00:35:49.059 --> 00:35:56.323]  It isn't good to go out and hurt people so that they will then come back and fight you, and then you call them terrorists.
[00:35:56.583 --> 00:35:57.083]  No, no, no, no.
[00:35:57.103 --> 00:35:59.344]  This is meant to make a new enemy!
[00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:00.745]  Like the Soviets!
[00:36:00.805 --> 00:36:16.893]  Our government, publicly, along with the British government, funded Lenin and Trotsky and their $25 million dollar train of gold when they were about to collapse right before the October Revolution, when the white Russians were kicking their behinds.
[00:36:18.664 --> 00:36:35.600]  The British funded that thing with New York money to bring down an empire, and then they put those thugs in there as oligarchs to feed on the people the whole time, telling them, oh, we're taking your farms, and we're taking your lands, and we're taking your companies, we're taking everything you've got for the people!
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.521]  Ha ha ha!
[00:36:36.781 --> 00:36:37.882]  Hey, tell them another one!
[00:36:37.962 --> 00:36:38.943]  Ha ha ha!
[00:36:39.103 --> 00:36:41.746]  I mean, you know, this is how they operate!
[00:36:44.913 --> 00:36:51.458]  They will work with anybody, communist, fascist, they don't care, as long as it's centralized.
[00:36:52.578 --> 00:36:55.901]  And the Council on Foreign Relations publication admits that every few months.
[00:36:56.521 --> 00:37:01.965]  Foreign Affairs, David Rockefeller's written this, many others have written this.
[00:37:03.086 --> 00:37:04.066]  Carol Quigley.
[00:37:05.047 --> 00:37:06.088]  I'm not going to lie to you.
[00:37:07.148 --> 00:37:14.790]  It's a, depending on which version of it it is, it's between 990-something pages and 1100-something pages long.
[00:37:15.531 --> 00:37:20.712]  And I probably read 400 pages, some of the key chapters, because I was given a footnoted copy.
[00:37:21.373 --> 00:37:29.115]  I guess that would have been 1996, when it finally went back into print, of Tragedy and Hope by Quigley.
[00:37:29.835 --> 00:37:31.296]  So I didn't read the 1100 pages.
[00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:37.473]  But I did read about half of it.
[00:37:37.854 --> 00:37:40.014]  I remember I read large portions.
[00:37:41.934 --> 00:37:43.895]  And you ought to go read it.
[00:37:43.915 --> 00:37:45.655]  I ought to sell that book.
[00:37:45.675 --> 00:37:46.475]  That's a good idea.
[00:37:47.195 --> 00:37:48.195]  It's expensive, though.
[00:37:49.276 --> 00:37:50.336]  And it's huge.
[00:37:50.896 --> 00:37:51.716]  It's like a Bible.
[00:37:52.396 --> 00:37:55.957]  And man, this guy worked for the New World Order.
[00:37:55.997 --> 00:38:02.058]  He was the head of the political science at Georgetown, one of the most elite universities in the country, for politics.
[00:38:03.613 --> 00:38:13.419]  And he said, I was allowed into the secret records of the New World Order, because I've been a member, but I was allowed to study their long-term strategic 100-plus year plan.
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.323]  And we fund communists and fascists, and we're here to bring in one world government.
[00:38:19.103 --> 00:38:22.065]  And we're here to totally enslave the people, because that's what's best for them.
[00:38:22.926 --> 00:38:25.787]  And we'll just type in Carol Quigley quotes.
[00:38:25.807 --> 00:38:27.649]  You can read his quotes all over the web for free.
[00:38:27.689 --> 00:38:29.630]  But don't believe it when you read it on the web.
[00:38:30.544 --> 00:38:32.185]  Though the quotes I've all seen are accurate.
[00:38:32.606 --> 00:38:34.887]  I want you to trot on down to the library.
[00:38:34.907 --> 00:38:41.012]  And I want you to go in there, and I want you to open up the page numbers it says, and I want you to read him saying it.
[00:38:41.812 --> 00:38:51.039]  Like when I say that, on page 400-something, David Rockefeller, three years ago, wrote that, yeah, he's bringing in world government, destroying America, and so what?
[00:38:51.139 --> 00:38:51.859]  He's proud of it.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.722]  I want you to go actually read the book.
[00:38:58.437 --> 00:39:00.739]  I tell you, I'm chilled to my bones right now.
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.322]  Tomorrow we'll be playing some clips of this.
[00:39:03.342 --> 00:39:17.456]  Aaron Russo, an interview I did with him this weekend, amazing individual, really respect him, went totally further than he's ever gone with his meetings with Nick Rockefeller, who was a close family friend.
[00:39:17.496 --> 00:39:18.917]  He's got photos of himself with him.
[00:39:20.198 --> 00:39:22.641]  Nick Rockefeller approached him
[00:39:25.678 --> 00:39:47.890]  When he was running for governor in Nevada and was getting 30 plus percent in the polls, he did get 30 percent at the polls, and they came to them, and he'd already made a couple big movies with Eddie Murphy and Bette Midler and had a clothing line, and a lawyer got in touch with him and said, Nick Rockefeller, who's also a big lawyer, would like to meet with you.
[00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:49.110]  You've already heard part of this on air.
[00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.851]  He's told the story.
[00:39:51.111 --> 00:39:53.632]  And he got to know Nick for, I don't know, three or four years.
[00:39:53.673 --> 00:39:54.333]  They were friends.
[00:39:55.661 --> 00:40:03.063]  And Nick was openly recruiting him and trying to get him to join the Council on Foreign Relations and saying, who cares about these slaves?
[00:40:03.323 --> 00:40:04.204]  They wouldn't help you.
[00:40:04.264 --> 00:40:05.344]  They're dumb anyways.
[00:40:05.844 --> 00:40:07.325]  And that's exactly how these leaders talk.
[00:40:07.365 --> 00:40:08.145]  I've talked to some of them.
[00:40:08.185 --> 00:40:12.026]  Not as high up as a Rockefeller, but pretty high level.
[00:40:14.147 --> 00:40:17.788]  And, you know, you just need to join us.
[00:40:17.908 --> 00:40:24.090]  And he told him, 11 months before 9-11, this is when he stopped being friends with Nick, when 9-11 happened,
[00:40:25.399 --> 00:40:28.180]  He told him, he said, you're going to see a big attack.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.421]  You're going to see an invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:40:31.801 --> 00:40:32.981]  And it's going to be so funny.
[00:40:33.321 --> 00:40:36.102]  They're going to be looking at all the caves for the imaginary Bin Laden.
[00:40:36.162 --> 00:40:37.082]  It's going to be so funny.
[00:40:37.402 --> 00:40:38.343]  Oh, they're so stupid.
[00:40:39.283 --> 00:40:41.484]  And everything's going to change.
[00:40:41.504 --> 00:40:43.564]  We're going to have a national ID card, police state.
[00:40:44.044 --> 00:40:47.705]  And then we're going to have even more events, and everybody's going to be forced to take a chip.
[00:40:48.966 --> 00:40:53.247]  But he said, don't worry, because our chips are going to say, kiss my hind end.
[00:40:55.149 --> 00:40:57.411]  Basically, on them, say, leave us alone to the police.
[00:40:59.532 --> 00:41:00.453]  And that's what they're already saying.
[00:41:00.533 --> 00:41:07.358]  And of course, a year after 9-11, Governor Ridge of Homeland Security, I saw him on C-SPAN say, your ID card will give you four different levels.
[00:41:07.938 --> 00:41:09.659]  Green, yellow, orange, and red.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.762]  Bad credit gets you a yellow, folks.
[00:41:12.802 --> 00:41:16.805]  And then they claim you don't have any Bill of Rights, any constitutional due processes.
[00:41:17.485 --> 00:41:18.186]  Due processes.
[00:41:19.967 --> 00:41:20.927]  And he went on and on.
[00:41:21.428 --> 00:41:22.849]  I just, it totally blew me away.
[00:41:26.565 --> 00:41:29.446]  Oh, and population reduction, how they're going to get rid of 80% of us?
[00:41:32.007 --> 00:41:38.289]  Of course they write that in the newspaper, it's not like it's a secret, but just to know what slime these people are.
[00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:45.532]  And by the way, they're behind the national vaccine programs, they're behind all the goodies in your vaccines.
[00:41:46.412 --> 00:41:51.094]  I mean, how you could trust a government run by eugenicists, who openly funded Hitler,
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:57.744]  I mean, Bill and Melinda Gates running around because they love the little African children.
[00:41:57.764 --> 00:42:00.186]  They give them all these loving shots.
[00:42:04.369 --> 00:42:09.292]  But meanwhile, they're also involved in funding population reduction organizations and groups.
[00:42:09.592 --> 00:42:11.193]  I mean, can you put two and two together?
[00:42:12.114 --> 00:42:14.256]  Let's say, oh, that's too horrible to believe.
[00:42:14.416 --> 00:42:15.737]  Okay, then fine.
[00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:23.311]  I just cannot believe how bad these people are right out in the open!
[00:42:25.951 --> 00:42:30.533]  And by the way, they didn't call you up, police officer, and tell you not to give your three-year-old a shot, did they?
[00:42:32.173 --> 00:42:37.235]  They didn't tell you, Marine Corps Captain, not to give your child a shot, or for your wife not to take one.
[00:42:38.816 --> 00:42:42.477]  Let's say there's a state rep listening right now and says, Wisconsin or Texas.
[00:42:43.137 --> 00:42:44.377]  You think you're a member of the elite?
[00:42:44.397 --> 00:42:46.378]  Nobody gave you a call and warned you, did they?
[00:42:48.621 --> 00:42:50.902]  You're not getting visits from the Rockefellers, are you?
[00:42:51.482 --> 00:42:53.503]  No, you're not, because you're not an elitist, okay?
[00:42:55.883 --> 00:42:58.784]  And you're not somebody who's threatening them, so you're never going to get a visit from them.
[00:42:59.465 --> 00:43:00.745]  I've had the visits, folks.
[00:43:02.806 --> 00:43:03.606]  I've had the visits.
[00:43:03.646 --> 00:43:04.106]  We're here.
[00:43:04.166 --> 00:43:08.388]  We'll give you a million plus if you come join us and be the new Rush Limbaugh.
[00:43:08.888 --> 00:43:11.609]  But we're going to control what you say and no more New World Order.
[00:43:11.929 --> 00:43:12.649]  And I said, you know what?
[00:43:12.669 --> 00:43:13.649]  You just take a hike.
[00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:18.031]  And I'm not even proud of myself for doing that years ago.
[00:43:19.286 --> 00:43:20.046]  For saying no?
[00:43:20.807 --> 00:43:21.827]  That's what you're supposed to do!
[00:43:21.867 --> 00:43:22.507]  That's normal!
[00:43:23.028 --> 00:43:23.828]  Keep my soul!
[00:43:24.188 --> 00:43:25.529]  I wasn't even tempted!
[00:43:27.569 --> 00:43:28.650]  Not for five minutes!
[00:43:30.791 --> 00:43:32.011]  Not for ten seconds!
[00:43:36.533 --> 00:43:42.356]  And to the average person who just will do anything for worldliness, Oh, that's such a... Oh, that's so honorable!
[00:43:42.396 --> 00:43:43.116]  That's so good!
[00:43:45.487 --> 00:43:49.450]  So you can have some more shekels, some more symbols of rank and power.
[00:43:55.434 --> 00:43:55.994]  Oh, man.
[00:43:57.956 --> 00:44:01.218]  You know, that's one thing all these bootlickers and social climbers don't know, either.
[00:44:01.598 --> 00:44:12.125]  They would sell their mother out for a stick of bubblegum for some rank, but they don't even know that Alan Greenspan was anti-New World Order for 30 years.
[00:44:14.364 --> 00:44:16.225]  And wrote books against the New World Order.
[00:44:17.105 --> 00:44:17.946]  I own some of them.
[00:44:19.807 --> 00:44:24.589]  And that they actually came and paid him off and made him the head of it just to shut up.
[00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:26.890]  That's another thing.
[00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:33.613]  These people who would sell out for a piece of bubble gum, they don't know if you held out, you'd get a lot more down the line.
[00:44:38.955 --> 00:44:42.317]  That's another little interesting point to all of this.
[00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:48.804]  First they offer you money, then they beat you up, and I guess then next they frame you or kill you.
[00:44:49.785 --> 00:44:50.165]  Whatever.
[00:44:51.446 --> 00:44:55.488]  All I know is I'm not going along with these people.
[00:44:56.008 --> 00:45:00.010]  And I'm telling the police and everybody else listening, this stuff is real, okay?
[00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:06.774]  I mean, you actually, when you really fight this stuff, you get approached by the evil!
[00:45:08.375 --> 00:45:13.998]  It's almost like in the old movies where the poof of smoke and the devil's there and he's going, hey, I got a deal for ya!
[00:45:19.142 --> 00:45:20.183]  Alright, let's play Lou Dobbs.
[00:45:20.203 --> 00:45:21.945]  This is absolutely amazing.
[00:45:21.965 --> 00:45:22.725]  Then I've got O'Reilly.
[00:45:22.765 --> 00:45:26.448]  I want to analyze his incredible, not even incredible lines.
[00:45:26.488 --> 00:45:29.971]  It's just so base is what's so effective about it.
[00:45:29.991 --> 00:45:32.734]  It's so easy and just mindless.
[00:45:33.354 --> 00:45:34.695]  But that's what good propaganda is.
[00:45:34.755 --> 00:45:38.419]  It's just real simple and that's what simple minds want.
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.162]  Very effective to his limiting audience.
[00:45:42.222 --> 00:45:45.685]  But here's Lou Dobbs going further than ever talking about
[00:45:46.397 --> 00:45:51.178]  The traitorous activities of our government in the New World Order.
[00:45:51.238 --> 00:45:51.638]  Here it is.
[00:45:52.559 --> 00:45:59.320]  Tonight a proposal for an expanded so-called free trade zone from Alaska to the tip of South America.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:09.543]  It's a plan from the business elites, the political elites, that will cost more American jobs, cost American sovereignty, but it would fulfill the President's father's vision.
[00:46:10.143 --> 00:46:11.044]  Bill Tucker reports.
[00:46:13.334 --> 00:46:14.415]  It's not a new idea.
[00:46:14.495 --> 00:46:16.557]  President Bush talked about it back in 1991.
[00:46:16.677 --> 00:46:18.879]  It is a big idea.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.041]  A new world order.
[00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:26.265]  Where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause.
[00:46:26.845 --> 00:46:32.030]  Now former United States Trade Ambassador Robert Zoellick is talking about it again with renewed vigor.
[00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:37.274]  This time a new world order with business at the helm of trade and economic policy.
[00:46:37.834 --> 00:46:42.058]  Advocating what he calls the Association of American Free Trade Agreements.
[00:46:42.578 --> 00:46:48.122]  A separate non-government entity which would include North, Central, and South America.
[00:46:48.463 --> 00:46:52.085]  What Zoellick is really proposing here is a stealth trade agenda.
[00:46:52.386 --> 00:46:53.807]  It's not a national agenda.
[00:46:53.847 --> 00:47:01.292]  He's proposing to set up what's essentially a private organization to try to achieve what he couldn't get done when he was the U.S.
[00:47:01.332 --> 00:47:02.253]  Trade Representative.
[00:47:02.814 --> 00:47:04.535]  And this is a business agenda.
[00:47:05.096 --> 00:47:17.058]  It's an agenda that goes hand-in-hand with the United States, Mexico, and Canada working quietly and behind the scenes to promote a common market with common deregulation for the benefit of multinational corporations.
[00:47:17.683 --> 00:47:21.448]  It's an agenda that so far has resulted in an increase in U.S.
[00:47:21.488 --> 00:47:28.696]  corporate profits of 45%, while wages of American workers have risen only 3% in the last five years.
[00:47:29.036 --> 00:47:36.065]  The main danger raised by Zelig's proposal is that the future of American international economic policy
[00:47:36.685 --> 00:47:51.953]  Which affects not only our nation's prosperity, but its national security, will be set not by the American people and their elected representatives, but by a small corporate elite that is accountable to no one but itself.
[00:47:52.834 --> 00:47:55.955]  Effectively surrendering the sovereignty of the United States.
[00:47:57.896 --> 00:48:04.800]  And as justification for trusting those who would have the authority, the argument is made that free trade promotes democracy and the welfare of the people.
[00:48:05.632 --> 00:48:09.595]  But Lou, one has to look no further than China to see whether that, in fact, is true.
[00:48:09.995 --> 00:48:14.799]  You know, talking about Zoellick's proposal, it's not Zoellick's proposal, it's Daddy's proposal.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.442]  And people better understand that they mean exactly what they're saying.
[00:48:18.502 --> 00:48:28.170]  It's a new world order they're trying to create, and they're trying to do so not only without approval or consent of the government in this country, but despite
[00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:29.451]  The popular will.
[00:48:30.531 --> 00:48:33.613]  This is a straightforward assault by the elitists in this country.
[00:48:34.033 --> 00:48:35.394]  And I appreciate it, Bill.
[00:48:35.474 --> 00:48:36.354]  Thanks very much, Bill Tucker.
[00:48:37.835 --> 00:48:39.596]  But it's the opposite of free market.
[00:48:39.616 --> 00:48:41.537]  You see, they keep saying it's about business.
[00:48:41.837 --> 00:48:42.977]  No, this isn't business.
[00:48:43.017 --> 00:48:44.038]  This is war.
[00:48:44.918 --> 00:48:55.944]  This is global corporations, bigger than most countries, getting together, coming in and rewriting our trade laws, so that any competition inside the nations is shut down.
[00:48:57.302 --> 00:48:58.342]  It's centrifugal.
[00:48:58.822 --> 00:49:02.903]  It's all there to consolidate wealth by hook or by crook.
[00:49:03.824 --> 00:49:06.984]  Then they say it's not Zelikow's, it's Daddy's.
[00:49:07.484 --> 00:49:08.585]  Daddy Bush is a puppet.
[00:49:08.605 --> 00:49:14.326]  It's not Daddy Bush, it's Daddy Rockefeller who's in partnership with Daddy Rothschild.
[00:49:14.386 --> 00:49:20.928]  And remember how they told you NAFTA and GATT would be so wonderful for the economy?
[00:49:21.028 --> 00:49:22.208]  Is the economy good today?
[00:49:22.268 --> 00:49:22.788]  No, it's not.
[00:49:24.809 --> 00:49:25.889]  We've gone from a nation
[00:49:26.641 --> 00:49:29.102]  The most wealthy nation in the world to a nation of debtors.
[00:49:29.762 --> 00:49:33.043]  A nation that grew its own food to a nation that doesn't grow its own food now.
[00:49:33.483 --> 00:49:34.263]  The majority of it.
[00:49:34.883 --> 00:49:40.605]  A nation that had the highest test scores to a nation that has the lowest test scores in the industrialized world.
[00:49:41.025 --> 00:49:42.566]  And the highest disease levels.
[00:49:43.386 --> 00:49:45.286]  And just the highest crime levels.
[00:49:45.406 --> 00:49:46.047]  And everything!
[00:49:47.127 --> 00:49:53.169]  Folks, they started waging war on the farmer 30-40 years ago, and they've destroyed the family farm.
[00:49:53.189 --> 00:49:54.729]  80 plus percent of them are shut down.
[00:49:55.416 --> 00:49:57.476]  They started waging war on the family.
[00:49:57.857 --> 00:50:00.337]  We had 10% illegitimacy 50 years ago.
[00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:01.337]  It's now over 50%.
[00:50:02.157 --> 00:50:03.318]  What they want, they get.
[00:50:04.258 --> 00:50:05.618]  Education is not a failure.
[00:50:05.678 --> 00:50:07.078]  They wanted to dial everybody down.
[00:50:07.478 --> 00:50:08.859]  They did a good job.
[00:50:10.519 --> 00:50:12.519]  The war on drugs has been a huge success.
[00:50:12.639 --> 00:50:14.040]  More drugs, more people in prison.
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:20.201]  I mean, once you just shift slightly your view on things, you can then, from an angle,
[00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:25.252]  You can then see both sides of it, and it's as clear as day!
[00:50:27.314 --> 00:50:31.236]  And under this new North American Union, you have no property rights.
[00:50:31.276 --> 00:50:37.380]  Why do you think they just have the Supreme Court rule, you don't have any property rights, and by the way, they don't even have to pay you for the land they take?
[00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:51.089]  It says in the ruling that private companies and individuals can, quote, lobby city, county, and state officials to take your land for their project.
[00:50:53.379 --> 00:50:56.862]  Supreme Court rulings saying they can bribe!
[00:50:59.644 --> 00:51:01.745]  Saying they can bribe!
[00:51:06.129 --> 00:51:06.889]  Think about that.
[00:51:08.991 --> 00:51:14.195]  They're building bribery into the law.
[00:51:16.477 --> 00:51:21.881]  And they're training police and military across the country to come forcibly take you off your land when you refuse.
[00:51:23.723 --> 00:51:24.523]  Baby, baby.
[00:51:26.764 --> 00:51:28.565]  I mean, I don't know what to say.
[00:51:29.626 --> 00:51:32.127]  The good news is they can't hide this much longer.
[00:51:32.147 --> 00:51:33.748]  This is so big.
[00:51:33.808 --> 00:51:35.008]  The battle is about to be joined.
[00:51:35.028 --> 00:51:39.770]  It's here.
[00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:44.712]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:45.073 --> 00:51:52.716]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:53.399 --> 00:52:00.462]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:52:00.862 --> 00:52:12.286]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police forgery, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:52:12.586 --> 00:52:16.107]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:52:16.548 --> 00:52:18.508]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:52:18.808 --> 00:52:22.590]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:46.371 --> 00:54:50.114]  If it keeps on raining, love is gonna break.
[00:54:51.075 --> 00:54:55.277]  When the levy breaks, I have no place to stay.
[00:54:57.162 --> 00:54:58.163]  Going down.
[00:54:58.823 --> 00:55:00.084]  Going down now.
[00:55:00.564 --> 00:55:01.585]  Going down.
[00:55:03.906 --> 00:55:05.988]  Down to Chicago.
[00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:10.651]  I'll tell you what's gonna happen.
[00:55:12.972 --> 00:55:15.494]  They're gonna keep running the New World Order right straight in the ground.
[00:55:15.514 --> 00:55:19.076]  Oh man.
[00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:23.179]  I just can't wait to bring these people to justice.
[00:55:25.813 --> 00:55:30.981]  Somebody emailed me yesterday, and they were concerned that I talked about killing a grizzly bear.
[00:55:31.582 --> 00:55:34.607]  It was all an analogy, or analogous.
[00:55:34.787 --> 00:55:36.370]  It was like a stupid parable.
[00:55:37.941 --> 00:55:40.444]  I mean, I overdo it a bit.
[00:55:40.704 --> 00:55:47.069]  I was saying, I have an instinctive... I see the New World Order threatening me at an instinctive level like a grizzly bear.
[00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:51.173]  You know, grizzly bears coming after me, I would try to evade it or kill it.
[00:55:51.653 --> 00:55:54.896]  Just like I want to, quote, kill the New World Order.
[00:55:54.936 --> 00:55:59.360]  And that's not a call for violence against grizzly bears or the New World Order.
[00:55:59.941 --> 00:56:05.025]  I'm saying my instinctive drive is to fight against it.
[00:56:07.509 --> 00:56:08.390]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:09.370]  I mean, we have a group.
[00:56:11.092 --> 00:56:11.812]  I mean, it's simple.
[00:56:12.232 --> 00:56:13.233]  I'm an average person.
[00:56:13.253 --> 00:56:14.174]  I'm not that smart.
[00:56:15.314 --> 00:56:21.639]  Twelve years ago... Well, I guess it's only fourteen years ago I learned of it, but twelve years ago I got involved.
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:24.160]  Well, let's be technical.
[00:56:24.181 --> 00:56:25.982]  I was involved before that, but it doesn't matter.
[00:56:27.683 --> 00:56:30.525]  That there was a plan to destroy my country.
[00:56:31.585 --> 00:56:34.026]  And I didn't hear it from some good old boy.
[00:56:34.086 --> 00:56:37.566]  I mean, I got it directly from the Globalist's own documents.
[00:56:38.067 --> 00:56:39.887]  And I said, gee, I'm not for that.
[00:56:39.967 --> 00:56:40.747]  I'd better fight it.
[00:56:42.448 --> 00:56:44.588]  And then I'd talk about it, and people would call me a kook.
[00:56:44.628 --> 00:56:50.230]  So I said, well, I'll just get into the media, and I'll present my facts, and I'll show them.
[00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:51.150]  And you know what?
[00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:52.730]  We have shown them.
[00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:54.971]  But that isn't what this is all about.
[00:56:55.031 --> 00:57:00.412]  It's about showing them so they can then get involved themselves and try to save the country.
[00:57:03.755 --> 00:57:08.477]  No, you don't save the country by saving its borders, or its sovereignty, or its Bill of Rights.
[00:57:08.797 --> 00:57:14.239]  You save it by invading Iran!
[00:57:14.259 --> 00:57:18.220]  No, you've got it turned around backwards there, my friend.
[00:57:20.281 --> 00:57:22.661]  And you need to figure that out, how you've been scammed.
[00:57:24.602 --> 00:57:33.065]  A few plugs here at the end of this hour, then we've got our guests coming up, then we'll have open phones from the bottom of this hour coming up through the end of the transmission.

[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:18.448]  And also, I want to plug 95.7, a new micro-FM that the great folks at Radio Free Austin put up in Dallas, covering all of Central Dallas.
[00:58:19.769 --> 00:58:20.069]  Yes, 95.7.
[00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:26.054]  If you live in Dallas, please tune it in and tell everybody you know about 95.7.
[00:58:29.176 --> 00:58:33.299]  Micro-FM, such an important part of the fight against the New World Order.
[00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:40.111]  Now, uh, and in closing for this hour, I have made 15 films.
[00:58:40.151 --> 00:58:43.432]  The newest is Terror Storm, the history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:58:43.872 --> 00:58:45.553]  It exposes the murderers that carried out 9-11.
[00:58:45.733 --> 00:58:49.554]  We need to bring them to justice, and I want you to get the video and make copies of it.
[00:58:50.074 --> 00:58:50.634]  Aggressively.
[00:58:52.595 --> 00:58:58.057]  With love for your family and hatred for the globalists, I want you to get it and militarily make copies.
[00:58:58.737 --> 00:58:59.417]  Smash them.
[00:58:59.577 --> 00:59:00.097]  Crush them.
[00:59:00.117 --> 00:59:01.218]  Never stop.
[00:59:01.958 --> 00:59:02.998]  Never stop.
[00:59:03.379 --> 00:59:04.419]  We are never gonna stop.
[00:59:04.972 --> 00:59:06.333]  They can kill us individually.
[00:59:06.513 --> 00:59:09.456]  They cannot kill the idea of liberty and freedom that God gave us.
[00:59:09.696 --> 00:59:12.519]  So get my videos at Infowars.com.
[00:59:12.819 --> 00:59:13.319]  Stay with us.

[00:59:29.646 --> 00:59:32.527]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:59:32.747 --> 00:59:38.949]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:27.450]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:27.931 --> 01:00:30.692]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:37.421 --> 01:00:38.082]  Big Brother.
[01:00:38.743 --> 01:00:39.784]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:40.505 --> 01:00:41.627]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:42.268 --> 01:00:43.069]  You want answers?
[01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:44.751]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:45.412 --> 01:00:49.097]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:49.598 --> 01:00:53.683]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:55.885 --> 01:01:00.646]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[01:01:00.686 --> 01:01:06.568]  The United States has been seized by a global corporate crime cartel called the New World Order.
[01:01:06.588 --> 01:01:09.049]  We just played Lou Dobbs last hour telling you that.
[01:01:09.669 --> 01:01:11.710]  We've been reporting them for over a decade here.
[01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.691]  They lied us premeditatively into war against Iraq.
[01:01:16.251 --> 01:01:19.032]  And like Hitler turning east, they now want to go into Iran.
[01:01:19.855 --> 01:01:22.998]  The torture, the murder, the secret police, all by design.
[01:01:23.038 --> 01:01:26.841]  They meant Iraq to be a quagmire as a pretext to build permanent bases there.
[01:01:26.881 --> 01:01:29.523]  It's all in official, published Pentagon documents.
[01:01:29.583 --> 01:01:30.124]  It's sick!
[01:01:30.744 --> 01:01:33.687]  And they have the nerve to tell our troops, you'll be back in time for Christmas.
[01:01:34.067 --> 01:01:38.070]  We're only going to be there six months when they plan to be there at least 30 years.
[01:01:38.151 --> 01:01:39.732]  And now top generals have been saying that.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.802]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:01:41.822 --> 01:01:44.024]  Your call is coming up in about 20 minutes.
[01:01:44.044 --> 01:01:44.785]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:44.805 --> 01:01:51.874]  Later, I'm going to air this clip of O'Reilly and just illustrate the low-grade lies he puts out.
[01:01:52.816 --> 01:01:54.918]  But we are joined by Robert Wattata.
[01:01:54.958 --> 01:01:58.503]  His son is Lieutenant Aaron Wattata.
[01:01:59.179 --> 01:02:00.620]  And he's being court-martialed.
[01:02:01.241 --> 01:02:05.804]  He's on record why he's refusing to go back to Iraq.
[01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:14.290]  He's on record why the war is illegal, how we've all been lied to, how this is an immoral, improper war.
[01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:21.215]  And his father is very well spoken, and I'm told is somewhat of an anti-corruption crusader in his own right, in Hawaii.
[01:02:21.936 --> 01:02:23.817]  So, Mr. Watada, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:26.319]  Thank you very much for inviting me, Alex.
[01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:28.196]  You bet.
[01:02:28.517 --> 01:02:38.701]  In a nutshell, tell us about yourself, your son, what's happening, how you got to this point, and let's come back, because we're about to break in a few minutes, and then break down what's currently happening.
[01:02:40.042 --> 01:02:54.869]  Okay, just a little bit about myself, Alex, is that in the Vietnam War, I don't know if we can call it a war, it was a slaughter, that the Americans perpetrated on the Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Laotians.
[01:02:55.299 --> 01:03:07.048]  I was just getting out of college at that time and I refused to participate in that war because I just felt it was just completely wrong.
[01:03:07.108 --> 01:03:08.369]  It was completely unjust.
[01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:14.975]  And of course I went to the Peace Corps and I later went on to college to maintain a student deferment.
[01:03:15.735 --> 01:03:17.917]  But on to my son.
[01:03:19.018 --> 01:03:21.420]  My son joined the Army in early 2003.
[01:03:23.531 --> 01:03:34.740]  Uh, based upon the call by the President that there were terrorists all across the country, uh, that people had needed to, uh, you know, join the military to defend our country.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:37.702]  So your son, in a well-meaning way, bought into the propaganda?
[01:03:38.103 --> 01:03:39.564]  He bought into the propaganda.
[01:03:41.265 --> 01:03:47.930]  Um, sorry to say, but I try to convince him otherwise, but, you know, young people are young people, and he made up his own mind.
[01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:49.652]  That's why they target 18-year-olds.
[01:03:50.272 --> 01:03:50.813]  That's right.
[01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:58.029]  They, you know, they don't think and they don't read a whole lot.
[01:03:58.669 --> 01:04:02.250]  But unfortunately, my son did join.
[01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:03.890]  It was for patriotic reasons.
[01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:05.391]  It was to defend our country.
[01:04:06.651 --> 01:04:16.313]  And it was sad, of course, that he did go into the army and he later became an officer and was deployed to Korea for a year.
[01:04:16.373 --> 01:04:21.034]  So he wasn't too familiar with what was going on in Iraq because he was in Korea.
[01:04:22.535 --> 01:04:24.156]  Which is a war zone, by the way.
[01:04:26.057 --> 01:04:38.744]  And then he was brought back to the United States and he went to Fort Lewis, Washington, where he was assigned to a Stryker Brigade in the middle of 2005.
[01:04:40.866 --> 01:04:48.410]  It was at this point that he began studying all about what was happening in Iraq, all the wars, you know, the battles and so forth.
[01:04:49.205 --> 01:04:54.810]  And he was also hearing from people who had been in Iraq, you know, soldiers and coming back.
[01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:57.193]  And sadly, some of those never came back.
[01:04:58.674 --> 01:05:02.357]  And, you know, he had to get a deal with the grief of some of the families.
[01:05:03.378 --> 01:05:13.167]  It was at this point that he began realizing that our president wholesale lied to the country, lied to
[01:05:15.615 --> 01:05:18.457]  You know, the military- Stay there, Mr. Watata.
[01:05:18.477 --> 01:05:23.941]  We'll talk about your son, what's happening to him with the court-martialing on the other side of this quick break.
[01:05:25.261 --> 01:05:27.263]  And they're talking about a national draft, folks.
[01:05:27.283 --> 01:05:28.564]  They're pushing it big time.
[01:05:28.604 --> 01:05:30.505]  When will they come for your sons and daughters?
[01:05:36.127 --> 01:05:39.313]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:05:39.653 --> 01:05:41.596]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:41.957 --> 01:05:49.610]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:50.276 --> 01:05:57.339]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:09.125]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:13.007]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:06:13.447 --> 01:06:15.368]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:06:15.688 --> 01:06:19.530]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:06:33.064 --> 01:06:33.845]  Terrorism.
[01:06:33.985 --> 01:06:34.745]  Terrorism.
[01:06:34.845 --> 01:06:40.909]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:06:41.169 --> 01:06:42.750]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:45.471]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:06:45.871 --> 01:07:00.440]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:00.780]  government.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.761]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:07:03.141 --> 01:07:09.046]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:07:09.186 --> 01:07:13.690]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:34.924]  Attention, attention everyone!
[01:07:34.944 --> 01:07:37.507]  A brand new invention just released.
[01:07:37.567 --> 01:07:42.272]  It's called Wristease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:49.756]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[01:07:50.297 --> 01:08:03.169]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[01:08:03.629 --> 01:08:07.593]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[01:08:08.053 --> 01:08:18.136]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[01:08:18.517 --> 01:08:21.518]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[01:08:21.918 --> 01:08:23.138]  That's Wristease.
[01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:28.520]  W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E Wristease.com.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.281]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[01:08:33.222 --> 01:08:38.864]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:44.926 --> 01:08:46.487]  Her station is just joining us.
[01:08:46.507 --> 01:08:53.369]  We're talking to the father of Lieutenant Aaron Wattadam, Robert Wattadam.
[01:08:55.570 --> 01:08:57.411]  And this young man joined the military.
[01:08:57.431 --> 01:08:58.651]  He was in for a few years.
[01:08:58.691 --> 01:08:59.671]  He heard the call in 2003.
[01:09:02.771 --> 01:09:14.421]  He was in, for stations that just joined us, recapping, he was there in the demilitarized zone, there in South Korea, then he was sent back to the U.S.
[01:09:14.441 --> 01:09:17.123]  for talking to troops that were coming back about how horrible it was.
[01:09:17.463 --> 01:09:19.885]  And I want to add this, I'm right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:09:20.265 --> 01:09:21.726]  There's military bases all around me.
[01:09:21.786 --> 01:09:22.947]  I have family in the military.
[01:09:23.428 --> 01:09:24.809]  I talk to people in the military.
[01:09:25.638 --> 01:09:35.604]  And I'd say about 85% of them hate the war, say it's all lies, know it's a joke, know it's a fraud, know it's all a big Halliburton profit operation.
[01:09:36.745 --> 01:09:37.406]  Okay?
[01:09:37.446 --> 01:09:39.227]  They know that, they understand that.
[01:09:40.688 --> 01:09:49.413]  Now, I do have one person in my family who just has been in the military for 20 years, and if they said jump off a cliff, he'd do it.
[01:09:50.114 --> 01:09:53.876]  And he's a smart guy, but it's willful, you know, cult member behavior.
[01:09:55.007 --> 01:09:57.509]  And this is what happens to people.
[01:09:58.049 --> 01:10:00.790]  But this is not the John Wayne military, okay?
[01:10:00.810 --> 01:10:01.931]  This is not Iwo Jima.
[01:10:02.952 --> 01:10:04.693]  This is not the Sands of Normandy.
[01:10:05.553 --> 01:10:07.994]  This is pure wickedness.
[01:10:09.395 --> 01:10:15.358]  And again, when you read the Israeli plan in 1983 to break the country up into three parts of endless war, they want civil war.
[01:10:15.659 --> 01:10:16.199]  You read the 2002 U.S.
[01:10:16.219 --> 01:10:16.639]  military plan,
[01:10:18.647 --> 01:10:21.969]  There is no doubt that mission has been accomplished.
[01:10:22.249 --> 01:10:25.270]  That's death, destruction, huge profits, endless war.
[01:10:25.530 --> 01:10:30.573]  That's why they disbanded the Iraqi military and security forces when all the experts said it'll make it break down.
[01:10:30.953 --> 01:10:32.854]  They said, of course, we want an excuse to stay there.
[01:10:33.334 --> 01:10:37.476]  You've got to realize how cynical and Machiavellian these people are.
[01:10:38.256 --> 01:10:40.677]  Alright, going back to Robert Watada.
[01:10:40.957 --> 01:10:44.079]  So your son, it's mid-2005, he's back at a U.S.
[01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:46.520]  base inside the U.S.
[01:10:47.527 --> 01:10:49.729]  And he starts to do research, he starts to learn.
[01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:51.671]  I would imagine you said he started to wake up.
[01:10:51.852 --> 01:10:58.938]  Did he see the White House memo where Bush and Blair meet and they talk about how to stage WMD fines and how to lie to the people?
[01:10:59.499 --> 01:11:02.862]  Or did he hear about how they faked the Yellow Cake document from Niger?
[01:11:03.403 --> 01:11:04.464]  Or did he learn about
[01:11:04.884 --> 01:11:05.965]  Yes, that's actually what happened, Alex.
[01:11:29.767 --> 01:11:47.756]  Of course, he's in Fort Lewis, Washington, I'm in Hawaii, and we're talking, and he's telling me all of these, all the things that he's hearing, and he's reading about, um, uh, one document you can look at is the State of the Union message that Bush gave in January 2003, where he details these lies.
[01:11:48.476 --> 01:11:53.479]  And anybody that says that they're not lies, um, doesn't understand English language.
[01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:57.841]  But, you know, it was when I read that document, and then I read other documents, such as,
[01:11:58.362 --> 01:12:05.245]  What Ray McGovern was saying is that all these things about the weapons of mass destruction were fabricated.
[01:12:05.265 --> 01:12:06.725]  They were made up.
[01:12:07.405 --> 01:12:09.266]  There was no truth at all to them.
[01:12:10.286 --> 01:12:14.068]  And yet this is what the Bush administration used to go to war.
[01:12:14.528 --> 01:12:18.569]  They said there was a connection between 9-11 and Saddam Hussein.
[01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:25.092]  None whatsoever, and of course that's been proven to be the truth, there was none whatsoever.
[01:12:25.754 --> 01:12:34.757]  What really broke my son's back is, this is what I'll tell you, is seeing what's happening to the soldiers coming back.
[01:12:37.138 --> 01:12:53.663]  He's not only seeing the soldiers that are not coming back, but he's also, you know, reading about these soldiers that are dying over there, the soldiers that are coming back with serious PTSD, and he's just asking himself, you know, what
[01:12:54.449 --> 01:12:56.537]  Are we doing to our own people?
[01:12:56.557 --> 01:12:59.989]  You know, and for what?
[01:13:01.303 --> 01:13:02.664]  Well, let's be specific there.
[01:13:03.105 --> 01:13:09.210]  In World War II, you only had to fly 22 missions in a B-17, though you had a 50% chance of dying.
[01:13:10.351 --> 01:13:12.312]  In Vietnam, one tour, that's it.
[01:13:12.713 --> 01:13:15.435]  I mean, even in a draft, you only make somebody serve one year.
[01:13:15.655 --> 01:13:18.077]  We've got people starting their fourth and fifth tours.
[01:13:18.598 --> 01:13:22.681]  Every psychologist will tell you that guarantees total breakdown.
[01:13:23.462 --> 01:13:24.623]  And this is serious.
[01:13:25.163 --> 01:13:35.006]  Low intensity, asymmetrical warfare, kicking down doors, house to house, the worst type of warfare for the psyche.
[01:13:35.046 --> 01:13:36.946]  I mean, these people are ruined!
[01:13:38.107 --> 01:13:39.047]  Oh yes, yes.
[01:13:40.127 --> 01:13:46.969]  In fact, several months ago, Alex, there was a story, and it wasn't circulated very much.
[01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:48.890]  It was hushed up very quickly.
[01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:52.571]  But a soldier came back from Iraq,
[01:13:53.487 --> 01:13:56.990]  And the very next day after he came back, he murdered his wife.
[01:13:57.690 --> 01:14:00.613]  Took a butcher knife or something and just butchered her up.
[01:14:01.573 --> 01:14:04.756]  These guys, these guys, you know, we've ruined them.
[01:14:06.717 --> 01:14:20.668]  Well, remember, out of one Delta Force squadron, why they call them squadrons, I don't know, folks, four guys came back, three of them killed their wives and children, one of them just flipped out and the police drove up and he was flopping around in the dirt screaming.
[01:14:23.081 --> 01:14:25.603]  I believe that.
[01:14:25.803 --> 01:14:39.334]  I met a woman who came up to me in one of the speaking engagements that we had and told me, told my wife and I, that her husband had come back from Iraq and he looked perfectly normal.
[01:14:40.154 --> 01:14:42.816]  And two weeks later, he had committed suicide.
[01:14:44.558 --> 01:14:45.618]  What do you do?
[01:14:45.658 --> 01:14:47.520]  This is what we're doing to our people.
[01:14:50.106 --> 01:14:50.626]  For what?
[01:14:50.746 --> 01:14:52.868]  This is what my son kept saying, for what?
[01:14:53.228 --> 01:14:53.728]  For what?
[01:14:54.368 --> 01:14:56.390]  You know, not for our country.
[01:14:57.210 --> 01:15:00.972]  They're not dying, they're not suffering for our country.
[01:15:00.992 --> 01:15:05.955]  They're doing it for Halliburton, they're doing it for Chevron, they're doing it for the Houston Oil Group.
[01:15:06.936 --> 01:15:16.421]  And that's the sad tragedy here, is that the American people have to understand that we've invaded Iraq,
[01:15:17.287 --> 01:15:18.548]  We're occupying Iraq.
[01:15:18.608 --> 01:15:20.669]  We're committing tremendous atrocities.
[01:15:20.769 --> 01:15:25.811]  I mean, you mentioned we've killed over 650,000 innocent Iraqis.
[01:15:27.532 --> 01:15:34.395]  Many, many more are dying because we're not allowing them to have medical facilities that are in operation.
[01:15:37.157 --> 01:15:38.477]  There's no potable water.
[01:15:38.497 --> 01:15:39.578]  There's no electricity.
[01:15:39.618 --> 01:15:42.019]  People are literally starving to death.
[01:15:42.039 --> 01:15:44.680]  Baghdad gets power and they're lucky about two hours a day?
[01:15:45.801 --> 01:15:46.421]  If they're lucky.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.160]  If they're lucky.
[01:15:48.601 --> 01:15:56.426]  And of course, you know, the green zone, the green zone where the... Prostitutes, topless bars, liquor, bowling alleys.
[01:15:57.427 --> 01:15:57.987]  They have them.
[01:15:58.747 --> 01:15:59.328]  Sex slaves.
[01:16:00.168 --> 01:16:00.629]  They have them.
[01:16:02.370 --> 01:16:04.931]  But the green zone has got electricity all the time.
[01:16:05.332 --> 01:16:07.713]  It's got two Olympic sized swimming pools.
[01:16:08.594 --> 01:16:10.595]  This is where our embassy staff is staying.
[01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:13.457]  And this is where the, you know, the public government is staying.
[01:16:14.077 --> 01:16:16.339]  In the five square miles called the green zone.
[01:16:17.953 --> 01:16:18.053]  Yes.
[01:16:37.725 --> 01:16:39.666]  Well, I mean, it's disgusting.
[01:16:40.106 --> 01:16:47.288]  We know Vietnam was about an endless war for profit and control, but at least they only made you serve one tour.
[01:16:47.489 --> 01:16:53.591]  I mean, this, this, how they're using DU, I mean, they knew about DU in the fifties, but they didn't use it because it was so deadly.
[01:16:53.931 --> 01:16:56.172]  Now they just tell the troops, DU's good for you.
[01:16:56.952 --> 01:16:58.492]  We'll make you serve four or five tours.
[01:16:58.532 --> 01:16:59.513]  That's good for you.
[01:16:59.533 --> 01:17:05.455]  I mean, it seems like a go for broke, just wildness now coming out of this elite.
[01:17:07.922 --> 01:17:13.923]  Oh, you know, just for signing up now, they're giving these new recruits $10,000.
[01:17:15.064 --> 01:17:20.865]  And so if you go on an extra tour, they're also saying, you know, okay, if you go on an extra tour, you know, here's another extra $20,000.
[01:17:21.185 --> 01:17:27.227]  And so what basically we have is we have these guys that are mercenaries.
[01:17:27.247 --> 01:17:33.148]  You know, the mercenaries that we have over there, you know that outside of the US Army,
[01:17:33.678 --> 01:17:34.178]  Are you okay?
[01:18:04.492 --> 01:18:05.673]  And they don't like that.
[01:18:06.754 --> 01:18:08.035]  They're offended by that.
[01:18:09.036 --> 01:18:09.756]  That's what they said.
[01:18:09.816 --> 01:18:11.758]  That's what they said in the pre-trial hearing.
[01:18:11.778 --> 01:18:14.420]  Well, the President isn't even our President.
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.001]  He signed on to the North American Union.
[01:18:16.241 --> 01:18:19.644]  He's a sack of traitorous filth.
[01:18:19.844 --> 01:18:20.604]  I agree with you.
[01:18:23.026 --> 01:18:31.993]  People have to understand that here we have a self-proclaimed dictator who is just as tyrannical as Hitler.
[01:18:34.525 --> 01:18:38.207]  I believe that, you know, God is on his side and he's right.
[01:18:38.607 --> 01:18:39.547]  Might makes right.
[01:18:41.348 --> 01:18:45.530]  And Americans have to wake up.
[01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:50.272]  Have to wake up to understand what we're doing to the Iraqi people.
[01:18:50.572 --> 01:18:51.853]  Where is your son right now?
[01:18:52.453 --> 01:18:53.833]  He's in Fort Lewis, Washington.
[01:18:53.893 --> 01:18:55.374]  My son is in Fort Lewis, Washington.
[01:18:55.394 --> 01:18:59.016]  Do they have him in the brigade or do they let him walk around?
[01:18:59.036 --> 01:19:00.396]  Oh, he's walking around.
[01:19:00.656 --> 01:19:04.038]  He lives off base and he goes to base every day.
[01:19:04.611 --> 01:19:10.532]  He's been reassigned to I-Corps, which is an administrative unit, and uh... When are they going to try him?
[01:19:10.572 --> 01:19:12.552]  This is going to be on February 5th.
[01:19:12.732 --> 01:19:14.593]  February 5th is going to be a court-martial.
[01:19:15.053 --> 01:19:17.373]  And so what did he say?
[01:19:17.433 --> 01:19:20.954]  I mean, what did he say, these great evil words that the President's deceptive?
[01:19:21.834 --> 01:19:29.295]  Well, he said them in a press conference, and then he also repeated some of the words in
[01:19:33.075 --> 01:19:39.279]  In the Veterans for Peace conference in August, about August 18th of this year.
[01:19:39.299 --> 01:19:51.486]  And so what they've done is they've taken words that's used and of course the judge pointed out to them that, you know, these words are very subjective and it could mean a lot of different things.
[01:19:52.326 --> 01:19:56.569]  But the prosecution says, well, nevertheless, they're offensive to them.
[01:19:57.763 --> 01:20:04.967]  And just because they're offensive, that he should be spending a year in jail for every offensive word that he used.
[01:20:04.987 --> 01:20:10.009]  This is where we're going in this country.
[01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:17.253]  That even soldiers, if they speak out and use words that somebody finds offensive, you're going to get prosecuted for it.
[01:20:17.513 --> 01:20:20.875]  Well, I mean, they're trying to do that with just the general public.
[01:20:20.915 --> 01:20:26.398]  They said the first... Newt Gingrich has given speeches saying, ban the First Amendment, arrest people, ban websites.
[01:20:27.674 --> 01:20:29.234]  Well, your son's gonna keep his soul.
[01:20:29.274 --> 01:20:29.934]  That's what matters.
[01:20:33.455 --> 01:20:37.016]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:20:37.056 --> 01:20:37.556]  are located?

[01:22:41.627 --> 01:22:44.929]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:22:47.535 --> 01:22:49.417]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[01:22:49.937 --> 01:22:52.319]  A 5% increase.
[01:22:52.859 --> 01:22:58.784]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the Euro.
[01:22:58.904 --> 01:23:02.027]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[01:23:02.876 --> 01:23:08.497]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[01:23:09.098 --> 01:23:12.118]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:36.170]  Why did you turn that down?
[01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:38.771]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[01:23:39.271 --> 01:23:43.773]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[01:23:43.933 --> 01:23:46.374]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[01:23:46.634 --> 01:23:47.815]  I could use something like that.
[01:23:47.935 --> 01:23:50.256]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[01:23:50.396 --> 01:23:53.277]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[01:23:53.357 --> 01:23:55.157]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[01:23:55.257 --> 01:23:57.518]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[01:23:57.898 --> 01:23:58.519]  I guess you're right.
[01:23:58.899 --> 01:23:59.599]  Why don't we try it?
[01:23:59.759 --> 01:24:01.720]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:06.525]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[01:24:06.545 --> 01:24:08.227]  I know where we can get some more information.
[01:24:08.607 --> 01:24:12.972]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.

[01:24:34.131 --> 01:24:39.296]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:39.956 --> 01:24:42.919]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:43.599 --> 01:24:45.661]  Look, the Naval War College head
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:53.484]  Gets up on C-SPAN and says our military works for Wall Street and the World Banks.
[01:24:55.265 --> 01:25:01.568]  DynCorp, our military, and Halliburton were openly in major papers running giant kidnapping rings in Iraq.
[01:25:02.509 --> 01:25:06.151]  I mean, they're involved in every form of trafficking and evil you can imagine.
[01:25:07.552 --> 01:25:13.395]  And I just can't believe anybody would serve over there, that anybody would be involved in this.
[01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:16.657]  And let the military try to persecute and prosecute
[01:25:17.610 --> 01:25:22.694]  People, like Mr. Watada, it's only going to backfire on them.
[01:25:23.074 --> 01:25:25.335]  Now, a lot of troops have spoken out against the war.
[01:25:25.976 --> 01:25:28.578]  Why do you think they have shingled out your son?
[01:25:30.059 --> 01:25:46.870]  They've shingled out my son because, one, he's an officer, and this is a real embarrassment for them that they weren't able to, you know, brainwash my son to the point that he believes that it's okay to kill.
[01:25:49.352 --> 01:25:54.633]  They also do not like the idea that he spoke out.
[01:25:55.954 --> 01:26:04.117]  That he got up at a press conference and said that what is going on in Iraq is wrong.
[01:26:06.517 --> 01:26:07.818]  That the President lied.
[01:26:09.258 --> 01:26:14.100]  Now is that before or after he refused to get deployed to Iraq?
[01:26:15.178 --> 01:26:16.819]  Well, it was at the same time.
[01:26:16.839 --> 01:26:32.903]  It was the same time that his brigade was going to go out, and so he made a public statement that he was not going to go with his brigade to Iraq because of the illegality of the war, the immorality of the war.
[01:26:33.964 --> 01:26:41.606]  And so it was at this point in time that they, of course, they forced an order on him to go, and he refused to go.
[01:26:43.525 --> 01:26:51.028]  Now, what are they going to do when more and more of the troops say no, and more and more of the troops are speaking out saying it's all a lie, what we hear on TV?
[01:26:52.328 --> 01:26:56.569]  Well, I think you're familiar with what happened in Vietnam.
[01:26:57.190 --> 01:27:00.591]  It was when the soldiers quit fighting that the war came to an end.
[01:27:01.731 --> 01:27:05.832]  And I get a feeling that that's what's going to happen in Iraq.
[01:27:06.092 --> 01:27:11.674]  Because as you know, most of the troops over there, the soldiers anyway,
[01:27:12.133 --> 01:27:15.196]  They know what they're doing over there is wrong.
[01:27:15.816 --> 01:27:27.787]  I recently received an email from a soldier and he says that everybody over here knows that what we're doing over here is wrong.
[01:27:30.409 --> 01:27:33.352]  It's just a matter of time before they're going to say enough is enough.
[01:27:35.501 --> 01:27:45.207]  What do you think about the development of them trying to go to Mexico, talk about mercenaries, to open huge recruiting stations to shift our military now over to foreigners?
[01:27:45.267 --> 01:27:47.528]  I mean, that's really getting imperial.
[01:27:48.608 --> 01:27:50.329]  Well, they've been doing this for a while now.
[01:27:50.389 --> 01:27:55.412]  They have been recruiting people in Mexico, in the barrios of Mexico, for some time.
[01:27:55.692 --> 01:27:59.094]  They've gone to the Philippines, they've gone to Puerto Rico.
[01:27:59.815 --> 01:28:03.637]  They go to these places where the poor kids do not understand anything, and they're told,
[01:28:04.156 --> 01:28:07.938]  Oh, you know you're going to get American citizenship if you fight.
[01:28:08.418 --> 01:28:15.842]  Well, I understand that that's sort of a joke also because all they do is they get green cards once they're out of the military.
[01:28:16.222 --> 01:28:17.543]  But they stay in the military.
[01:28:18.243 --> 01:28:21.885]  Now, you talk about four or five tours over there.
[01:28:22.005 --> 01:28:24.747]  These people are not going over there because they want to go over there.
[01:28:25.707 --> 01:28:27.488]  They have something called stop loss.
[01:28:28.732 --> 01:28:30.333]  And they're forced to go over there.
[01:28:30.973 --> 01:28:31.354]  That's right.
[01:28:31.374 --> 01:28:34.295]  We've got people who've already served and they make them stay in.
[01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:35.396]  That's correct.
[01:28:37.017 --> 01:28:42.901]  Uh, they're, you know, they even have reserve officers now, reserve, uh, members of the Army.
[01:28:43.381 --> 01:28:44.281]  They're forced to go back.
[01:28:44.301 --> 01:28:52.206]  But I mean, what's wrong with the elite that they're wearing the military down to nothing and recruiting foreigners and doing, I mean, this is just crazy.
[01:28:54.207 --> 01:28:55.108]  It is insane.
[01:28:55.949 --> 01:28:56.389]  You're right.
[01:28:56.509 --> 01:28:57.209]  It is insane.
[01:29:00.130 --> 01:29:11.239]  Oil and corporate profits are so important for Bush and Cheney and Rice and of course Rumsfeld is still around there.
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.122]  We're also talking about Henry Kissinger.
[01:29:15.883 --> 01:29:17.825]  We're talking about James Baker.
[01:29:17.845 --> 01:29:19.126]  These guys
[01:29:20.337 --> 01:29:23.879]  The corporate profits are so important for them that they'll do anything.
[01:29:24.099 --> 01:29:31.884]  What do you think about the Democrats attempting to increase troops and now they're getting some heat so they're going to have a few hearings and try to just put everybody off?
[01:29:31.924 --> 01:29:35.346]  We have 78% in major polls of the American people.
[01:29:35.366 --> 01:29:39.049]  70% of the troops in polls want to come home, but they're not home!
[01:29:39.429 --> 01:29:40.089]  Where are they?
[01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:42.011]  We've been there three and a half, four years!
[01:29:43.872 --> 01:29:47.374]  You know, on January 15th there's going to be a group called
[01:29:49.257 --> 01:29:57.843]  Appeal for redress, or petition for redress, and they're going to present this to Congress.
[01:29:57.883 --> 01:30:02.066]  They're going to present this request.
[01:30:02.406 --> 01:30:03.227]  Stay there.
[01:30:03.287 --> 01:30:11.593]  Do about five minutes on the other side with me, sir, because I want to talk about solutions and also how we help your son and other soldiers that don't want to fight for the New World Order.
[01:30:12.133 --> 01:30:13.254]  It's not our military.
[01:30:13.314 --> 01:30:14.095]  It's not our country.
[01:30:14.759 --> 01:30:17.803]  And as soon as we get around to realizing that, we can get America back.
[01:30:18.224 --> 01:30:20.407]  But not a minute before we realize it.
[01:30:23.131 --> 01:30:24.032]  We're on the march.
[01:30:24.512 --> 01:30:26.115]  The empire's on the run.
[01:30:27.056 --> 01:30:29.740]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:33.408 --> 01:30:34.289]  It's no secret.
[01:30:34.529 --> 01:30:40.033]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[01:30:40.193 --> 01:30:44.997]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[01:30:45.297 --> 01:30:47.619]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[01:30:47.799 --> 01:30:50.381]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called NoVO.
[01:30:50.641 --> 01:30:58.808]  NoVO eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration, which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[01:30:58.968 --> 01:31:03.211]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in NoVO.
[01:31:03.491 --> 01:31:09.716]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and geranium.
[01:31:09.896 --> 01:31:14.060]  No-BO's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin.
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:18.583]  You can use No-BO under your arms, on tough foot odors, or for athlete's foot.
[01:31:18.743 --> 01:31:22.727]  No-BO is guaranteed 100% or receive a full refund.
[01:31:23.067 --> 01:31:25.609]  Visit No-BO.com to order.
[01:31:25.729 --> 01:31:28.551]  That's No-BO.com or call 850-723-8599.
[01:31:33.271 --> 01:31:33.852]  It's a fact.
[01:31:34.032 --> 01:31:38.476]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:31:38.937 --> 01:31:44.122]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:31:44.422 --> 01:31:47.625]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[01:31:47.886 --> 01:31:54.993]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:31:55.333 --> 01:32:02.535]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:32:02.955 --> 01:32:04.796]  We also do credit restoration.
[01:32:05.256 --> 01:32:11.578]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[01:32:11.798 --> 01:32:15.559]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[01:32:15.939 --> 01:32:18.501]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.
[01:32:18.541 --> 01:32:19.382]  to 5 p.m.
[01:32:19.442 --> 01:32:20.643]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[01:32:20.663 --> 01:32:20.843]  That's 920-293-8024.
[01:32:20.923 --> 01:32:22.064]  And ask for Robert.
[01:32:22.124 --> 01:32:25.447]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:32:35.276 --> 01:32:39.400]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:41.402]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:32:41.662 --> 01:32:47.948]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:32:48.228 --> 01:32:54.354]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:32:54.614 --> 01:32:56.456]  The Biosolutions Frequency Instrument.
[01:32:56.716 --> 01:32:57.076]  I think so.
[01:33:19.125 --> 01:33:20.626]  I really should have built a wall.
[01:33:50.941 --> 01:33:52.722]  Welcome back!
[01:33:52.842 --> 01:34:09.730]  We've got Debbie Morrow coming up for a few minutes.
[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:17.880]  Always great to have her.
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:21.981]  I want to play this clip of O'Reilly.
[01:34:22.061 --> 01:34:24.002]  And again, I'm not giving him attention.
[01:34:24.062 --> 01:34:25.902]  I'm not focusing in on the mainstream media.
[01:34:25.942 --> 01:34:27.122]  I really think that's a diversion.
[01:34:27.682 --> 01:34:38.845]  But it's important to play this just to illustrate for people out there that support him and support the war and support all this, the type of mindlessness and the tactics that are being used against you.
[01:34:40.365 --> 01:34:44.066]  I mean, you need to be aware that you're being targeted with propaganda.
[01:34:46.650 --> 01:34:52.653]  Going back to our guest, Bob Wattata, father of Aaron Wattata, Lt.
[01:34:52.673 --> 01:34:56.095]  Aaron Wattata, who's up for court marshalling on February 5th.
[01:34:56.476 --> 01:34:57.616]  We'll be following that here.
[01:34:57.676 --> 01:35:02.819]  Darja Maul's being called as a prosecution witness because he was at one of the events where he spoke.
[01:35:03.619 --> 01:35:05.280]  A frequent contributor to this broadcast.
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:07.662]  We'll be getting him on to talk about it as well.
[01:35:08.022 --> 01:35:11.904]  Just unbelievably disgusting that they're trying all of this.
[01:35:12.324 --> 01:35:14.225]  We're simply pointing out the President was deceptive.
[01:35:14.746 --> 01:35:15.246]  We know!
[01:35:16.064 --> 01:35:16.865]  That he's deceptive.
[01:35:16.905 --> 01:35:18.066]  We know he's a criminal.
[01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:21.108]  We know they premeditatedly lied about WMDs.
[01:35:21.128 --> 01:35:22.189]  They've lied about everything!
[01:35:23.429 --> 01:35:24.510]  They're always lying!
[01:35:26.051 --> 01:35:30.034]  And, you know, a lot of us are outraged at the traitorous activities of this government.
[01:35:30.915 --> 01:35:34.117]  Mr. Watada, in closing, any websites you want to plug?
[01:35:34.197 --> 01:35:37.500]  Any organizations that are moving forward trying to end this war?
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:39.802]  Any way we can help your son?
[01:35:40.882 --> 01:35:43.284]  Well, certainly we have a website.
[01:35:43.804 --> 01:35:44.305]  Thank you.
[01:35:45.051 --> 01:35:46.312]  Thank you, lt.org.
[01:35:46.792 --> 01:35:48.914]  Thank you, lt.org.
[01:35:49.775 --> 01:36:00.183]  That's the website that we have up there for Aaron to try to let everybody know what is happening and what we would like to see them do to help Aaron.
[01:36:03.345 --> 01:36:04.926]  Give that website out again one more time.
[01:36:05.127 --> 01:36:05.427]  Okay.
[01:36:05.747 --> 01:36:06.488]  Thank you, lt.org.
[01:36:06.528 --> 01:36:07.048]  T-H-A-N-K-Y-O-U-L-T.
[01:36:14.013 --> 01:36:14.473]  Not or.
[01:36:44.493 --> 01:36:45.994]  And so I salute your son.
[01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:47.595]  Well, thank you very much.
[01:36:47.655 --> 01:36:52.237]  We are also very proud of him for taking the stand he has.
[01:36:52.317 --> 01:37:03.003]  We know that he's going to possibly be put into jail for it, but, you know, there's people like Martin Luther King was jailed.
[01:37:04.343 --> 01:37:05.624]  Rosa Parks was jailed.
[01:37:05.664 --> 01:37:08.926]  These people stood up and said, hey, this is wrong.
[01:37:09.226 --> 01:37:10.566]  Jesus Christ was jailed.
[01:37:10.967 --> 01:37:12.127]  Jesus Christ was jailed.
[01:37:12.247 --> 01:37:13.668]  Founding fathers were jailed.
[01:37:14.594 --> 01:37:18.636]  That's correct.
[01:37:18.816 --> 01:37:21.598]  Even George Washington was called a traitor by his own people.
[01:37:21.618 --> 01:37:25.921]  He was called a traitor because he went against the king.
[01:37:27.462 --> 01:37:28.102]  Absolutely.
[01:37:28.142 --> 01:37:31.904]  Well, we appreciate you coming on, sir, and we'll check in with you as this develops.
[01:37:31.964 --> 01:37:36.127]  I know you'll be very busy around the trial, but I'd like to get you on during that, and I appreciate you.
[01:37:37.087 --> 01:37:40.889]  Well, thank you very much, Alex, and just call me.
[01:37:41.129 --> 01:37:43.631]  You have my number, and I would be glad to join you on your show.
[01:37:44.329 --> 01:37:45.070]  Thank you, Robert.
[01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:45.510]  Take care.
[01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:46.330]  Thank you.
[01:37:47.451 --> 01:37:48.032]  Alright.
[01:37:48.992 --> 01:37:50.113]  Just disgusting.
[01:37:51.834 --> 01:37:58.359]  And I understand you can have everybody running around in the military generally shooting their mouth off about the President, but I mean, these are criminals.
[01:37:59.399 --> 01:38:05.764]  And it's in the military code that if you've got a criminal government, you are to resist it, you are to speak out against it.
[01:38:06.844 --> 01:38:08.345]  It's in the Declaration of Independence.
[01:38:08.446 --> 01:38:10.927]  This government is criminal.
[01:38:11.267 --> 01:38:11.868]  Period.
[01:38:13.985 --> 01:38:15.867]  And you can't put perfume on a pig.
[01:38:16.747 --> 01:38:17.868]  It cannot be done!
[01:38:18.569 --> 01:38:20.671]  This war is a shame to America!
[01:38:21.351 --> 01:38:30.099]  And the very people orchestrating this war are the very people implementing the destruction of our borders and the North American Union.
[01:38:30.479 --> 01:38:32.861]  They're the very ones butchering the Bill of Rights!
[01:38:33.121 --> 01:38:34.542]  That's MY Bill of Rights!
[01:38:34.843 --> 01:38:37.165]  Not yours, you sniveling neocons!
[01:38:39.166 --> 01:38:41.088]  That's the heart and soul of the U.S.!
[01:38:41.508 --> 01:38:42.049]  Not you!
[01:38:44.188 --> 01:38:44.928]  Not you!
[01:38:45.449 --> 01:38:50.891]  You don't own, and you don't run this country, and you don't own, and you don't run me!
[01:38:50.911 --> 01:38:58.295]  So stop running around on your moral high horses, Republican listeners out there.
[01:38:59.135 --> 01:39:01.256]  People who aren't conservative, you're Republican.
[01:39:01.816 --> 01:39:05.518]  You like your pervert, homosexual, Republican leaders.
[01:39:08.699 --> 01:39:12.141]  That's what you like, that's what you love, that's what you're into.
[01:39:13.436 --> 01:39:15.336]  And I bring that up because it throws them for a loop.
[01:39:15.777 --> 01:39:18.717]  George Bush is about as conservative as a three dollar bill.
[01:39:21.478 --> 01:39:22.838]  And it's just a joke!
[01:39:23.178 --> 01:39:24.179]  You are a joke!
[01:39:26.119 --> 01:39:27.879]  And you know who you are out there listening.
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:30.580]  You make me sick.
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:33.961]  This country has been completely hijacked.
[01:39:35.201 --> 01:39:38.722]  And I just bring up the whole gay thing because it's just so ridiculous that
[01:39:39.324 --> 01:39:43.267]  Going back to the late 80s, right through to today, there's constantly gay prostitutes in there.
[01:39:43.748 --> 01:39:46.610]  That's what these guys are into at Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones.
[01:39:47.170 --> 01:39:48.551]  And I just, it's just such a joke.
[01:39:48.571 --> 01:39:53.816]  And then I'm tired of liberals blaming Christians, going, oh, look at your Christian leaders!
[01:39:54.756 --> 01:39:57.619]  You know, look at Bush, he believes God told him to do it.
[01:39:57.939 --> 01:40:00.881]  He believes, he just does that to manipulate Christians.
[01:40:01.241 --> 01:40:03.003]  That guy is as Christian as Satan.
[01:40:04.637 --> 01:40:05.137]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:40:05.157 --> 01:40:05.897]  Let's go Debbie Morrow.
[01:40:05.957 --> 01:40:07.038]  I'm going to go to this O'Reilly thing.
[01:40:07.098 --> 01:40:08.338]  I'm going to cover some of the news.
[01:40:08.378 --> 01:40:11.479]  Then the third hour, solid, blitzkrieg of calls.
[01:40:12.919 --> 01:40:14.500]  I will take unending calls.
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:15.140]  Lots of them.
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:19.481]  Debbie Morrow, hadn't had you on in two or three weeks.
[01:40:19.521 --> 01:40:20.441]  Good to have you here with us.
[01:40:21.241 --> 01:40:22.602]  Thank you for having me back.
[01:40:22.642 --> 01:40:31.084]  You know, we were closed for the holidays and we could get all of our bookkeeping done for the new year and now we are ready to go.
[01:40:32.062 --> 01:40:35.987]  Take your orders and get back to selling Berkies!
[01:40:52.126 --> 01:40:54.589]  You also have the national distributors for the British Burkies.
[01:40:55.129 --> 01:40:57.832]  She gets a big discount on those as well.
[01:40:58.232 --> 01:40:59.513]  Call her for prices.
[01:40:59.994 --> 01:41:02.516]  This is the big national manufacturer and distributor.
[01:41:02.776 --> 01:41:05.359]  But they've got Debbie just to handle radio interviews.
[01:41:05.399 --> 01:41:08.302]  Just to give you that personal customer service.
[01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:09.583]  And she's a wonderful lady.
[01:41:09.883 --> 01:41:11.084]  They've got a free brochure.
[01:41:11.104 --> 01:41:14.287]  They've got sports bottles that just make the water safe to drink.
[01:41:14.307 --> 01:41:17.050]  They've got purifiers that totally clean it out.
[01:41:17.731 --> 01:41:19.212]  The water is full of poison.
[01:41:19.232 --> 01:41:22.234]  What do you mean full of poison?
[01:41:22.555 --> 01:41:23.976]  Just go read what the EPA allows.
[01:41:24.016 --> 01:41:24.556]  Herbicide.
[01:41:24.596 --> 01:41:25.237]  Pesticide.
[01:41:25.577 --> 01:41:26.478]  Heavy metals.
[01:41:28.039 --> 01:41:28.799]  Chlorine.
[01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:30.701]  It goes on and on.
[01:41:31.321 --> 01:41:33.763]  And people need to give Debbie Morrow a call.
[01:41:35.004 --> 01:41:37.646]  This is one area of your life you can take control right now.
[01:41:37.926 --> 01:41:41.169]  And that's to stop drinking all of the poison that's in the water.
[01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.469]  Debbie?
[01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:42.790]  That's correct.
[01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:44.511]  You said it all, Alex.
[01:41:45.292 --> 01:41:46.753]  We're here to take your calls.
[01:41:47.406 --> 01:41:56.328]  You know, the Berkey water systems are affordable, and if you're buying bottled water now, you know, it's going to pay for itself in no time.
[01:41:56.348 --> 01:41:59.769]  It's a great, easy-to-use system.
[01:42:00.169 --> 01:42:02.610]  You don't have to call a plumber to get it plumbed in.
[01:42:02.710 --> 01:42:04.690]  It's all standalone product.
[01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:15.133]  Made in America, and it actually purifies the pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and sediment, and the VOCs to a non-detectable level.
[01:42:15.173 --> 01:42:16.433]  It's set a new standard.
[01:42:17.108 --> 01:42:18.729]  In the water filter industry.
[01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:21.751]  And we'd like to get those out to all of your listeners.
[01:42:22.932 --> 01:42:24.593]  Well, you've got a bunch of different units.
[01:42:24.633 --> 01:42:26.574]  Describe what a $198, $195 unit does.
[01:42:26.594 --> 01:42:27.695]  Okay.
[01:42:29.616 --> 01:42:39.863]  Well, we have a Travel Berkey, which is a stainless steel one and a half gallon system that you can use in an apartment, house.
[01:42:39.923 --> 01:42:41.944]  It's good for one or two or three people.
[01:42:41.964 --> 01:42:44.666]  It's great if you want to have it for on the go.
[01:42:45.456 --> 01:42:52.059]  A lot of our customers, a lot of your listeners, save their Berkeys for, God forbid, something really bad happens.
[01:42:52.539 --> 01:42:54.880]  And I always try to encourage you, don't do that.
[01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:55.920]  Use it every day.
[01:42:55.940 --> 01:43:01.443]  It's something that you want to do every day because bad things are happening every day to your water.
[01:43:02.063 --> 01:43:05.084]  It's, you know, there's bad stuff in the water all the time now.
[01:43:05.544 --> 01:43:09.306]  We don't want to wait until there's nuclear fallout because you want to get out the VOCs
[01:43:10.427 --> 01:43:13.708]  The chemicals and you know things like MTBE.
[01:43:13.808 --> 01:43:18.430]  Well every major city they found Ritalin and Prozac and then everything else in it.
[01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:24.972]  The fish can't even reproduce in most major city lakes now because of all the female hormones just from birth control pills alone.
[01:43:25.292 --> 01:43:34.295]  That's right and we want to filter our water the best we can so that we know that we're getting out all of these bad contaminants that are in the water.
[01:43:34.375 --> 01:43:35.375]  No they're nutritious.
[01:43:37.136 --> 01:43:38.176]  Well you know I have a
[01:43:38.971 --> 01:43:39.291]  I think so.
[01:43:56.104 --> 01:43:57.124]  Think about America!
[01:43:57.144 --> 01:44:04.427]  They got 15 million kids on this, and now they passed the Federal New Freedom Initiative to federally fund forcing more kids on it.
[01:44:05.107 --> 01:44:11.829]  This stuff makes their heart expand, their brains shrink, retards growth causes all sorts of heart attacks.
[01:44:12.209 --> 01:44:13.989]  That's mainstream news, man!
[01:44:14.009 --> 01:44:20.991]  Then they'll knock your door down looking for illegal drugs, which the government shipped in to begin with.
[01:44:21.311 --> 01:44:23.392]  I mean, I just cannot deal with it anymore!
[01:44:24.793 --> 01:44:25.593]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:44:25.633 --> 01:44:27.234]  That's a drug pushing trash!
[01:44:27.674 --> 01:44:28.234]  That's it.
[01:44:28.514 --> 01:44:29.395]  That's it, Alex.
[01:44:29.495 --> 01:44:35.297]  And so, we want to get these Berkeys out to as many people as possible, so please give me a call.
[01:44:35.317 --> 01:44:37.358]  Yeah, give them a call.
[01:44:38.661 --> 01:44:47.909]  Give her a call right now, 1-888-803-4438, 808-803-4438, or Berkeywater.com online.
[01:44:47.929 --> 01:44:58.357]  You can order via the Safe, Secure shopping cart, and right there in the comments section, tell them what free gift you want with one of the big Berkeys, potassium iodide, a sports bottle, sheltering-in-place DVD, 888-803-4438, or Berkeywater.com.
[01:44:58.397 --> 01:45:00.019]  Debbie, how was your holiday?
[01:45:04.783 --> 01:45:08.484]  Actually, we had a really, really wonderful holiday.
[01:45:09.404 --> 01:45:10.284]  It was kind of quiet.
[01:45:10.325 --> 01:45:11.865]  Thanksgiving's our big holiday.
[01:45:11.925 --> 01:45:16.066]  Christmas, we stay home and be kind of quiet and got real rested.
[01:45:16.346 --> 01:45:16.826]  That's good.
[01:45:16.846 --> 01:45:18.427]  That's why I wish I could have done that.
[01:45:19.187 --> 01:45:20.007]  Yeah, it was great.
[01:45:20.587 --> 01:45:22.007]  Hey, Debbie, thank you for coming on.
[01:45:22.027 --> 01:45:23.708]  Say hi to your husband and family for me.
[01:45:23.868 --> 01:45:24.248]  I will.
[01:45:24.328 --> 01:45:27.509]  Thank you for having me, and I look forward to hearing from your listeners.
[01:45:27.909 --> 01:45:31.870]  Leave your number twice, so in case I don't hear it correctly the first time, okay?
[01:45:32.432 --> 01:45:33.092]  Debbie, thank you.
[01:45:33.112 --> 01:45:33.853]  Thank you.
[01:45:34.693 --> 01:45:35.074]  God bless.
[01:45:35.114 --> 01:45:36.875]  God bless you.
[01:45:36.895 --> 01:45:40.717]  888-803-4438, or Berkeywater.com, or order via Infowars.com.
[01:45:41.177 --> 01:45:43.639]  Okay, there's so many lies.
[01:45:44.159 --> 01:45:52.464]  I'm going to play it, and we're going to stop the tape, and I'm going to comment as we go through it, or I would never be able to later comment on all of it.
[01:45:52.724 --> 01:46:01.589]  This is O'Reilly with the leader of the group that protested when the Democrats were trying to shill with their pro-war position.
[01:46:02.199 --> 01:46:03.059]  After flip-flopping.
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:13.724]  Okay, and then notice how he tries to say they have no members, they're a little group, they're nobody, they're disrupting, they're bad, they're crazy.
[01:46:13.784 --> 01:46:15.405]  It's all buzzwords.
[01:46:15.625 --> 01:46:16.945]  Here it is.
[01:46:17.005 --> 01:46:20.967]  Even though the Democrats took control of Congress today, some on the far left are not happy.
[01:46:21.327 --> 01:46:25.569]  When Democratic Congressman Rahm Emanuel tried to give a speech yesterday, here's what happened.
[01:46:26.915 --> 01:46:31.579]  At every step of the... At every... We're going to keep going here.
[01:46:31.699 --> 01:46:34.321]  We're going to have a... Thank you.
[01:46:53.655 --> 01:46:55.456]  No, Emanuel could not get his remarks out.
[01:46:55.556 --> 01:47:01.380]  Joining us from Washington, Sunsara Taylor, prominent member of the far-left group, The World Can't Wait.
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:06.083]  Some members of your group were in that mob, that screaming mob.
[01:47:06.563 --> 01:47:08.825]  Why do you do that, and what's the worthiness of that?
[01:47:09.679 --> 01:47:12.841]  Well, Bill, right now what we see is the U.S.
[01:47:12.901 --> 01:47:15.062]  is involved in a criminal war in Iraq.
[01:47:15.542 --> 01:47:16.782]  It was launched illegally.
[01:47:16.823 --> 01:47:18.723]  It's cost hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives.
[01:47:18.783 --> 01:47:19.984]  It's cost thousands of U.S.
[01:47:20.044 --> 01:47:20.684]  soldiers lives.
[01:47:21.045 --> 01:47:26.967]  There's been a whole doctrine of preemptive war that's been codified into place and an institutionalization of torture.
[01:47:27.408 --> 01:47:38.253]  These are war crimes and crimes against humanity and Congress is not speaking about them, so people have an obligation to step up and speak the truth and to demand a stop to these crimes.
[01:47:38.513 --> 01:47:48.376]  Okay, so you're saying that the new Democrat Congress in here now, you're not even going to give them a chance to address the things that you just... Okay, let's stop right there.
[01:47:48.936 --> 01:47:49.817]  Let's stop right there.
[01:47:51.297 --> 01:47:57.799]  They, these Democrat groups, attack people like me when I said you watch the Democrats are going to come in and say increase the troops.
[01:47:58.539 --> 01:48:06.102]  They're going to do whatever that Henry Kissinger, George Shultz slash James Baker group says.
[01:48:07.463 --> 01:48:14.590]  And then now those groups, and I have to commend them, did, after they saw the Democrats were gonna basically go for expansion of the war, they got mad!
[01:48:14.991 --> 01:48:20.316]  And they went in there and tried to shut down press conferences to get media attention that the American people demand!
[01:48:22.098 --> 01:48:25.422]  So, here he is claiming that they're not even giving the Democrats a chance.
[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:27.961]  That's lie number one.
[01:48:28.221 --> 01:48:38.009]  Then he starts trying to talk about how they're a minority view, and that people don't agree with them, and that it's her view that the war was a lie, and that it's her opinion.
[01:48:38.289 --> 01:48:39.830]  No, those are facts, buddy!
[01:48:40.311 --> 01:48:41.071]  Like gravity!
[01:48:41.332 --> 01:48:42.913]  Let's go back to Bill O'Reilly.
[01:48:43.613 --> 01:48:46.896]  ...down, so they can't even address it even if they wanted to.
[01:48:47.016 --> 01:48:47.937]  Is that what you're telling me?
[01:48:48.875 --> 01:48:49.916]  No, that's not what I'm saying.
[01:48:49.936 --> 01:48:55.461]  I'm saying the Democrats have made very abundantly clear that they are not calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
[01:48:55.541 --> 01:48:57.723]  This is the only just solution right now.
[01:48:57.743 --> 01:49:08.413]  Okay, so unless the Democrats or the Republicans or whatever official, whoever official, whoever is elected, immediately withdraw from Iraq, you will not let them speak.
[01:49:08.453 --> 01:49:10.415]  Your group will shout them down.
[01:49:10.475 --> 01:49:12.196]  This is your version of democracy.
[01:49:12.256 --> 01:49:14.939]  You think this is what the country should be.
[01:49:15.442 --> 01:49:16.503]  They speak all the time.
[01:49:16.563 --> 01:49:29.131]  The voices that are not heard are the voices like Cindy Sheehan's, like the protesters who are out today demanding... She gets plenty of publicity and she gets plenty of opportunities... The voices talking about the war crimes that are being committed in our names right now, the fact that because of the U.S.
[01:49:29.191 --> 01:49:39.378]  occupation of Iraq, hundreds of thousands of Iraqi people's lives have been destroyed, people have been killed, torture has been committed and legalized... Okay, but look... These things are not being discussed the way they should.
[01:49:39.418 --> 01:49:39.479]  Ms.
[01:49:39.499 --> 01:49:41.500]  Taylor, that's your opinion, okay?
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:42.601]  Stop right there!
[01:49:43.601 --> 01:49:44.462]  That's your opinion!
[01:49:45.194 --> 01:49:54.163]  White House memos say they can torture people till they die, official, torture children with pliers, it's all there, they've used it, they've done it.
[01:49:54.724 --> 01:49:55.945]  No, no, that's her opinion.
[01:49:57.306 --> 01:50:00.690]  Now again, he's playing to this mindless audience that's got Alzheimer's.
[01:50:01.605 --> 01:50:07.832]  Out there, who literally can't even... They just lack O'Reilly.
[01:50:08.072 --> 01:50:11.656]  They just want to be lied to by this butcher of America.
[01:50:11.696 --> 01:50:12.897]  Here it is.
[01:50:12.937 --> 01:50:13.938]  But those are facts.
[01:50:14.339 --> 01:50:15.360]  No, they're not facts.
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:17.482]  You are a lunatic.
[01:50:17.982 --> 01:50:19.824]  And if you weren't a lunatic... Hit pause again.
[01:50:20.765 --> 01:50:22.027]  She goes, those are facts.
[01:50:22.067 --> 01:50:23.148]  He says that's her opinion.
[01:50:24.506 --> 01:50:29.669]  Okay, about it being an unjust war, a staged war, they lied us into war, torture, being legitimized.
[01:50:30.129 --> 01:50:32.210]  No, no, those aren't facts.
[01:50:33.851 --> 01:50:34.712]  That's your opinion.
[01:50:34.732 --> 01:50:36.052]  She says, no, they are facts.
[01:50:36.392 --> 01:50:38.454]  And he goes, you're a loon.
[01:50:38.774 --> 01:50:40.455]  You're a loon.
[01:50:41.955 --> 01:50:42.836]  She's a loon.
[01:50:44.097 --> 01:50:46.078]  That's all he ever does with people he disagrees with.
[01:50:46.098 --> 01:50:47.739]  He calls them a loon.
[01:50:48.799 --> 01:50:50.120]  Well, you're a pervert, buddy.
[01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:52.041]  You're a perv.
[01:50:52.822 --> 01:50:56.705]  Who sexually harasses, admittedly, women, hardcore, that work for you.
[01:50:58.626 --> 01:50:59.527]  I mean, how do you like that?
[01:50:59.567 --> 01:51:04.511]  I mean, if anybody is a loon at you, Bill O'Reilly, who would get up there and lie about the death of America?
[01:51:04.711 --> 01:51:06.232]  Who would push the North American Union?
[01:51:06.252 --> 01:51:09.755]  Have you ever heard him say, ban SUVs, ban the militia?
[01:51:10.035 --> 01:51:11.156]  You're a piece of trash!
[01:51:11.676 --> 01:51:12.837]  You're not a real conservative.
[01:51:13.137 --> 01:51:14.078]  You're a piece of filth!
[01:51:15.319 --> 01:51:16.440]  You've got to be ashamed of yourself.
[01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:17.500]  You're a big bully!
[01:51:18.061 --> 01:51:18.721]  You're a punk!
[01:51:19.702 --> 01:51:22.044]  Well, come back and play the rest of what this punk has to say.
[01:51:23.647 --> 01:51:24.928]  Stay with us, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:41.374]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:51:41.734 --> 01:51:49.357]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:50.074 --> 01:51:57.118]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:57.518 --> 01:52:08.945]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:52:09.265 --> 01:52:12.787]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:52:13.227 --> 01:52:15.168]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:52:15.489 --> 01:52:19.251]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:33.487 --> 01:52:34.467]  Good morning, honey.
[01:52:34.828 --> 01:52:40.810]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[01:52:41.090 --> 01:52:41.710]  Yeah.
[01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:43.491]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:52:43.851 --> 01:52:47.273]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel Berkey system.
[01:52:47.733 --> 01:52:49.233]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:52:49.673 --> 01:52:51.354]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:52:51.754 --> 01:52:53.515]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:52:53.715 --> 01:52:54.655]  Honey, cheer up!
[01:52:55.015 --> 01:52:57.276]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:52:57.516 --> 01:52:57.856]  What?
[01:52:58.277 --> 01:53:08.760]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:13.882]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[01:53:14.202 --> 01:53:15.384]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:36.011]  Welcome back!
[01:54:55.517 --> 01:54:58.059]  Good old Troy in West Virginia hasn't been on in a few weeks.
[01:54:58.099 --> 01:54:58.900]  He's called in.
[01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:02.623]  And we'll go to Don, Wolf, Joe and many others.
[01:55:02.943 --> 01:55:04.544]  Let me finish up with O'Reilly though.
[01:55:05.625 --> 01:55:08.287]  And this young lady did an excellent job up against him.
[01:55:08.307 --> 01:55:09.108]  And that's how you do it.
[01:55:09.128 --> 01:55:09.949]  Just talk over him.
[01:55:09.989 --> 01:55:10.829]  Stay on your point.
[01:55:12.150 --> 01:55:12.891]  Just ignore him.
[01:55:12.931 --> 01:55:13.992]  He was getting real upset.
[01:55:14.032 --> 01:55:15.113]  His face was turning red.
[01:55:15.959 --> 01:55:32.207]  But it doesn't matter, he still wins because his audience is mindless idiots who want to convince themselves that everything's alright, that America's perfect, that nothing's wrong, that everything's kosher, and as long as he just calls people crazy, then everything must be true, he says!
[01:55:32.707 --> 01:55:33.848]  So, back to the tape.
[01:55:34.577 --> 01:55:35.778]  That's your opinion, okay?
[01:55:35.879 --> 01:55:38.021]  And you're entitled under the Constitution to your opinion.
[01:55:38.041 --> 01:55:38.982]  But those are facts.
[01:55:39.002 --> 01:55:40.003]  No, they're not facts.
[01:55:40.043 --> 01:55:41.084]  You are a lunatic.
[01:55:41.104 --> 01:55:46.249]  Torture is being... And if you weren't a lunatic, 90% of America would agree with you.
[01:55:46.509 --> 01:55:47.310]  You're a lunatic.
[01:55:47.530 --> 01:55:48.972]  You've got maybe 8%... Stop!
[01:55:49.232 --> 01:55:49.432]  Stop!
[01:55:49.492 --> 01:55:51.234]  He says maybe 8% agree with you.
[01:55:52.055 --> 01:55:56.820]  Folks, there have been... There's gotta be 50-something scientific polls the last few months.
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:57.901]  They've been all over television.
[01:55:58.767 --> 01:55:59.828]  Seventy-eight percent.
[01:55:59.888 --> 01:56:00.448]  I say that.
[01:56:00.809 --> 01:56:04.311]  It's between seventy-five and eighty-two percent, depending on what poll you look at.
[01:56:04.331 --> 01:56:07.153]  So I just say seventy-eight, you know, average it.
[01:56:08.034 --> 01:56:08.974]  Go pull it up yourself.
[01:56:09.295 --> 01:56:10.015]  Are against the war.
[01:56:10.435 --> 01:56:11.636]  Seventy percent of the troops.
[01:56:13.357 --> 01:56:19.122]  I mean, everybody knows that it's a wildly unpopular war, even with a bunch of Republican senators and congressmen.
[01:56:20.262 --> 01:56:21.663]  From Hagel to Paul.
[01:56:22.704 --> 01:56:23.845]  No, you're a loon!
[01:56:23.885 --> 01:56:24.806]  It's crazy!
[01:56:25.246 --> 01:56:26.847]  Only eight percent are against it!
[01:56:26.907 --> 01:56:28.128]  Talk about lying!
[01:56:29.170 --> 01:56:31.390]  I mean, just listen to what comes out of his mouth!
[01:56:32.271 --> 01:56:37.312]  But people at home, man, watching Fox News in their rocking chairs, they're like, that's right, everybody loves it!
[01:56:37.632 --> 01:56:38.672]  Everybody likes it!
[01:56:38.992 --> 01:56:39.792]  It's good!
[01:56:40.092 --> 01:56:40.892]  Here, go back to it.
[01:56:41.352 --> 01:56:42.113]  You're a lunatic.
[01:56:42.333 --> 01:56:44.493]  You've got maybe 8% that agree with you.
[01:56:44.513 --> 01:56:48.114]  No, the majority of the country is against this president and against this form.
[01:56:48.154 --> 01:56:49.794]  The majority of the country, Ms.
[01:56:49.814 --> 01:56:52.095]  Taylor, with all due respect, think that you're a loon.
[01:56:52.455 --> 01:56:53.075]  Okay, and wouldn't you?
[01:56:53.135 --> 01:56:53.475]  That's not true.
[01:56:53.495 --> 01:56:53.755]  Yes.
[01:56:54.075 --> 01:56:55.255]  And if they were with you, they would.
[01:56:55.855 --> 01:56:58.816]  See, it's high school popularity mentality.
[01:56:59.722 --> 01:57:02.205]  It's junior high, low-grade moron behavior.
[01:57:02.786 --> 01:57:04.127]  Everybody thinks you're a kook!
[01:57:04.207 --> 01:57:05.329]  Ha ha!
[01:57:05.409 --> 01:57:07.031]  She thinks the world's round!
[01:57:07.051 --> 01:57:08.112]  Ha ha!
[01:57:08.212 --> 01:57:09.433]  She's stupid!
[01:57:09.453 --> 01:57:13.138]  I mean, it's just, it's base!
[01:57:14.499 --> 01:57:17.343]  Base propaganda is effective with a dumbed-down public!
[01:57:17.823 --> 01:57:18.344]  Back to the pervert.
[01:57:19.912 --> 01:57:25.596]  ...to be out with the signs when you demonstrate, instead of you and your paltry little group, which number about 50 or 60.
[01:57:26.316 --> 01:57:27.477]  That is a lie as well.
[01:57:27.517 --> 01:57:28.397]  That is a lie as well.
[01:57:28.437 --> 01:57:29.358]  No, we don't want attention.
[01:57:29.378 --> 01:57:34.001]  We want an end to the crimes being committed in our names, or we're complicit with them.
[01:57:34.701 --> 01:57:35.602]  World can't wait.
[01:57:35.662 --> 01:57:40.085]  Those other groups have had over 5 million people in the streets of America.
[01:57:41.107 --> 01:57:50.510]  I mean, yeah, it's a couple thousand here in Austin, a couple hundred thousand in New York, a couple hundred thousand in D.C., a couple hundred thousand in L.A., a couple hundred thousand in Chicago, a couple hundred thousand in London.
[01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:54.731]  But I've been at demonstrations where it had to be a million in New York.
[01:57:54.751 --> 01:58:06.015]  I mean, I'd be up in the Empire States Building looking down at the RNC, and there'd be people protesting across 20 roads, 20 different blocks, just everywhere, people.
[01:58:06.508 --> 01:58:07.209]  And the news would say 200,000.
[01:58:07.469 --> 01:58:10.353]  Hell, one street was 200,000!
[01:58:12.315 --> 01:58:12.976]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:58:13.036 --> 01:58:14.958]  He says 50 people!
[01:58:15.599 --> 01:58:18.002]  That's how many in America are against the war! 50!
[01:58:20.365 --> 01:58:21.326]  Back to the liar!
[01:58:40.106 --> 01:58:46.068]  Over and over again, he says, what's wrong then with the American people are the majority stupid and the majority are for the war.
[01:58:46.588 --> 01:58:48.848]  Now everyone knows the majority are against the war.
[01:58:49.108 --> 01:58:51.889]  So he lies and says the majority are for the war.
[01:58:53.209 --> 01:58:55.530]  Then he says, oh and you say they're stupid.
[01:58:56.630 --> 01:58:58.371]  See, base psychology.
[01:59:00.551 --> 01:59:01.592]  This is what they do.
[01:59:02.112 --> 01:59:03.492]  But it works on a lot of people.
[01:59:04.132 --> 01:59:06.453]  Alright, we'll come back, finish up the O'Reilly clip, go to
[01:59:07.401 --> 01:59:10.544]  We got a Troy from Florida and others.

[01:59:24.611 --> 01:59:25.652]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:59:25.972 --> 01:59:28.753]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:59:29.033 --> 01:59:33.176]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:59:33.616 --> 01:59:34.436]  So what do you do?
[01:59:34.756 --> 01:59:39.319]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:59:39.819 --> 01:59:41.940]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:43.340]  Sheltering in place.
[01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:47.442]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[01:59:47.762 --> 01:59:56.045]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked with you easy to follow.

[02:00:25.547 --> 02:00:28.428]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:34.851 --> 02:00:35.511]  Big Brother.
[02:00:36.151 --> 02:00:37.252]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:37.932 --> 02:00:39.072]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:39.713 --> 02:00:40.513]  You want answers?
[02:00:41.273 --> 02:00:42.214]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:42.834 --> 02:00:46.495]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:47.016 --> 02:00:51.137]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:52.138 --> 02:00:52.578]  Alright!
[02:00:53.550 --> 02:00:56.851]  Your phone calls are coming up on this live, 5th day of January, 2007.
[02:00:57.151 --> 02:01:00.351]  Already into the third hour.
[02:01:02.612 --> 02:01:08.793]  You know, some immigrants are arrested six times, but the average was actually eight times before anything's done to them.
[02:01:10.273 --> 02:01:13.114]  There's also been a neocon attack on Somalia.
[02:01:13.914 --> 02:01:17.334]  A nuclear weapon almost exploded in Texas.
[02:01:17.374 --> 02:01:20.255]  That's United Press International and the Austin American-Statesman.
[02:01:21.115 --> 02:01:22.436]  We'll tell you about that.
[02:01:22.456 --> 02:01:24.999]  The Democrats aren't really challenging the war.
[02:01:25.059 --> 02:01:26.020]  We'll break that down.
[02:01:26.941 --> 02:01:35.809]  I was finishing up with O'Reilly, but listen to the clip we were playing where he's attacking the World Can't Wait group, and he's saying, you have 50 members, you're nobody.
[02:01:35.849 --> 02:01:38.071]  This group alone has got millions in the streets.
[02:01:39.452 --> 02:01:41.935]  Then he says, the majority of Americans are for the war.
[02:01:41.955 --> 02:01:44.377]  What are the majority of Americans dumb?
[02:01:45.183 --> 02:01:47.967]  So number one, the majority of Americans aren't for the war.
[02:01:48.027 --> 02:01:48.628]  That's admitted.
[02:01:48.648 --> 02:01:49.769]  That's a lie, what he said.
[02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:57.639]  And on top of that, the majority... He's claiming she's saying they're stupid when she didn't say that.
[02:01:58.300 --> 02:01:58.700]  So it just...
[02:01:59.801 --> 02:02:00.562]  There's more of it.
[02:02:00.642 --> 02:02:01.502]  Every trick in the book.
[02:02:02.102 --> 02:02:04.604]  It's mindless, but it works on a mindless public.
[02:02:04.684 --> 02:02:05.084]  Go ahead.
[02:02:05.625 --> 02:02:08.146]  What's wrong with the majority of the American people?
[02:02:08.246 --> 02:02:09.247]  Are we all stupid?
[02:02:09.487 --> 02:02:10.287]  Bill, everybody knows.
[02:02:10.327 --> 02:02:12.749]  No, the majority of the American people oppose George Bush.
[02:02:12.769 --> 02:02:13.890]  I don't think they're stupid.
[02:02:13.970 --> 02:02:14.950]  Everybody knows.
[02:02:15.210 --> 02:02:17.051]  Everybody knows that people went to the president.
[02:02:17.071 --> 02:02:17.572]  Hit pause right there.
[02:02:19.133 --> 02:02:22.355]  The Supreme Court appointed George Bush in 2000, okay?
[02:02:22.395 --> 02:02:23.695]  And I was neutral at that time.
[02:02:24.356 --> 02:02:25.537]  I'm certainly not for Al Gore.
[02:02:25.557 --> 02:02:26.077]  The point is,
[02:02:27.329 --> 02:02:28.011]  That's not true.
[02:02:28.472 --> 02:02:30.739]  And there was clear election fraud that was stolen in 2004.
[02:02:30.799 --> 02:02:31.541]  No doubting that.
[02:02:34.242 --> 02:02:35.443]  Continue with O'Reilly.
[02:02:35.924 --> 02:02:41.969]  People went to the polls in November, largely motivated by their opposition to this illegal war and opposition to George Bush.
[02:02:41.989 --> 02:02:47.053]  And if Congress will not respond to that, then we have an obligation to the people of the world and to the people of this country.
[02:02:47.313 --> 02:02:51.237]  Are we going to be the generation that's remembered as the people who sat back and allowed torture to be legalized?
[02:02:51.257 --> 02:02:52.778]  What exactly is your obligation?
[02:02:52.818 --> 02:02:55.240]  To shout down people like Rahm Emanuel?
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:56.341]  He's a liberal Democrat.
[02:02:56.401 --> 02:02:58.262]  Rahm Emanuel walked out of there.
[02:02:58.463 --> 02:02:59.584]  That was his choice to do.
[02:02:59.624 --> 02:03:01.085]  He has a platform all the time.
[02:03:01.145 --> 02:03:02.446]  That's beside the point.
[02:03:02.486 --> 02:03:05.367]  So you think you have an obligation to shout him down?
[02:03:08.788 --> 02:03:09.668]  Absolutely!
[02:03:09.828 --> 02:03:20.010]  We need to go everywhere these criminals are and expose them on the open borders, the Federal Reserve, the illegal war, anything and everything that's bad for this country and that's unconstitutional.
[02:03:20.531 --> 02:03:21.151]  Absolutely!
[02:03:21.191 --> 02:03:22.431]  Declaration of Independence.
[02:03:22.771 --> 02:03:28.032]  When the government becomes destructive of those aims, it is our right and duty to overthrow it.
[02:03:28.433 --> 02:03:30.193]  Not just go protest it, you twit!
[02:03:31.181 --> 02:03:36.206]  Absolutely, we need guerrilla information war to get around your PSYOPs, you Pentagon employee.
[02:03:36.546 --> 02:03:37.186]  Back to it!
[02:03:37.747 --> 02:03:39.588]  Crimes of this administration to a halt.
[02:03:40.009 --> 02:03:47.315]  Okay, but that's not going to happen because most Americans... It's not going to happen unless people stand up and... No, it's not going to happen ever, because they don't agree with you.
[02:03:47.776 --> 02:03:49.377]  They don't think you're correct.
[02:03:49.978 --> 02:03:52.360]  And if they did, then you would have millions of people.
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:55.203]  A war of aggression by Nuremberg standards.
[02:03:55.223 --> 02:03:59.006]  By Nuremberg standards, there's no legitimate cause of self-defense.
[02:03:59.026 --> 02:03:59.866]  That's a war of aggression.
[02:03:59.906 --> 02:04:01.488]  That's a war crime of the highest order.
[02:04:01.508 --> 02:04:02.609]  That's an objective fact.
[02:04:02.669 --> 02:04:04.330]  Let me just recap.
[02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:10.475]  You believe that your group, as small as it is, has a right to shout down Congress.
[02:04:10.495 --> 02:04:16.561]  You're saying that torture should be allowed to go on just because George Bush and the Congress don't want to challenge it.
[02:04:16.641 --> 02:04:18.102]  I'm saying that's unconscionable, Bill.
[02:04:18.382 --> 02:04:24.925]  You know, if the country were the way that you portray it, you would be in Guantanamo Bay being tortured.
[02:04:24.945 --> 02:04:25.225]  14,000 people.
[02:04:25.365 --> 02:04:26.046]  Okay.
[02:04:26.106 --> 02:04:28.747]  If the country were the way you are portraying it, you'd be hanging up on a hustle.
[02:04:28.767 --> 02:04:35.930]  Bill, your government has proclaimed for himself the right to detain anybody without charges, without a lawyer, without even knowing what charges are against them.
[02:04:35.950 --> 02:04:36.091]  Ms.
[02:04:36.111 --> 02:04:36.331]  Taylor.
[02:04:36.351 --> 02:04:38.152]  This is a cornerstone of the rule of law.
[02:04:38.172 --> 02:04:42.534]  According to you, all of our Congress people, all of our Congress people are corrupt.
[02:04:42.674 --> 02:04:43.534]  They're complicit.
[02:04:43.574 --> 02:04:44.535]  They're all complicit.
[02:04:44.615 --> 02:04:45.375]  They're all corrupt.
[02:04:45.555 --> 02:04:46.535]  Yeah, most of them are.
[02:04:46.855 --> 02:04:48.896]  Notice he said she'd be hanging up on a meat hook.
[02:04:49.416 --> 02:04:53.057]  Like that's how they do things in the third world when our government funds all the big death squads.
[02:04:54.538 --> 02:04:58.219]  And they are arresting people all over this country for their political views and what they say and do.
[02:04:58.659 --> 02:05:00.800]  And they do have the Pentagon spying on peace groups.
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:12.063]  But I mean, just the incredible lie that they've got 15 members and the majority of Americans are pro-war and pro-Bush.
[02:05:15.031 --> 02:05:17.732]  I mean, it's just, it's base.
[02:05:19.153 --> 02:05:19.793]  It's base.
[02:05:20.553 --> 02:05:25.996]  Alright, we'll talk to one of their damaged goods individuals on the other side.
[02:05:26.016 --> 02:05:29.037]  We'll talk to one of their minions.
[02:05:33.596 --> 02:05:38.983]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:05:39.363 --> 02:05:47.013]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:47.702 --> 02:05:54.745]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:55.146 --> 02:06:06.531]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:06:06.891 --> 02:06:10.413]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:06:10.853 --> 02:06:12.794]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:13.114 --> 02:06:16.956]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:07:23.615 --> 02:07:34.244]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:07:34.464 --> 02:07:37.867]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:07:38.047 --> 02:07:41.470]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:07:41.767 --> 02:07:45.029]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:07:45.049 --> 02:07:50.513]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we've seen.
[02:07:50.553 --> 02:08:00.179]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:08:00.319 --> 02:08:01.620]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:07.084]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:08:07.481 --> 02:08:13.464]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems, it'll work on other problems as well.

[02:08:30.402 --> 02:08:35.446]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:35.806 --> 02:08:38.107]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:40.449 --> 02:08:43.131]  Well, a nuclear weapon almost went off in Texas.
[02:08:43.191 --> 02:08:46.633]  If it would have, they would have blamed it on LCI data and taken more of your freedoms.
[02:08:47.614 --> 02:08:50.596]  Main Town makes it illegal to smoke in cars.
[02:08:53.032 --> 02:08:57.453]  When are you going to quit running your mouth and start actually doing something for real, you and your listeners?
[02:08:57.473 --> 02:08:58.533]  All you do is talk, talk, talk.
[02:08:58.713 --> 02:09:01.514]  When are y'all going to start taking some action?
[02:09:19.488 --> 02:09:19.928]  What do you mean?
[02:09:19.988 --> 02:09:21.569]  You think you're going to defeat the likes of me?
[02:09:21.950 --> 02:09:23.210]  You're never going to defeat me.
[02:09:24.371 --> 02:09:25.552]  And what is the likes of you?
[02:09:25.612 --> 02:09:26.492]  Please describe yourself.
[02:09:26.512 --> 02:09:26.953]  Neocons.
[02:09:28.513 --> 02:09:29.394]  You're a neocon?
[02:09:29.954 --> 02:09:31.135]  As far as I'm concerned, yeah.
[02:09:31.715 --> 02:09:32.516]  What do you stand for?
[02:09:32.556 --> 02:09:33.156]  Tell us, Troy.
[02:09:35.037 --> 02:09:38.640]  Whatever I stand against, everything you stand for, basically.
[02:09:40.141 --> 02:09:41.101]  I'm the opposite of you.
[02:09:41.361 --> 02:09:43.382]  So you stand against the Bill of Rights in America?
[02:09:43.402 --> 02:09:44.703]  Yeah, the Bill of Rights.
[02:09:44.803 --> 02:09:47.565]  I don't spend one second of my life worrying about the Bill of Rights.
[02:09:47.972 --> 02:09:49.133]  I'm free to do what I want to do.
[02:09:49.153 --> 02:09:50.054]  I've said it before.
[02:09:50.875 --> 02:09:53.237]  Yes, I am free to do what I want to do.
[02:09:53.257 --> 02:09:54.358]  Nothing's changed since the day I was born.
[02:09:54.378 --> 02:09:56.560]  That's because you're a low-level peon.
[02:09:56.901 --> 02:09:57.481]  No, I'm not.
[02:09:57.802 --> 02:09:59.443]  Your listeners are the low-level peons.
[02:09:59.463 --> 02:10:02.166]  They're the ones that average $10,000 a year income.
[02:10:02.426 --> 02:10:06.089]  When are you people going to start doing something?
[02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:09.533]  So the government doesn't take people's farms and ranches in scams?
[02:10:10.473 --> 02:10:12.814]  And if they do, they deserve it, is what you're saying.
[02:10:13.114 --> 02:10:14.375]  I'm not saying anything of the sort.
[02:10:14.395 --> 02:10:17.837]  I'm just saying, when are you people going to do something instead of running your own mouths?
[02:10:18.717 --> 02:10:20.278]  Well, we do a whole hell of a lot.
[02:10:20.298 --> 02:10:24.160]  Yeah, you make little goofy movies and you have your little symposiums with 80 people.
[02:10:24.661 --> 02:10:25.681]  What do they do?
[02:10:25.821 --> 02:10:33.045]  Well, if you want to really get technical, I had a symposium with 1,200 people and we had to turn away another 2,000 or so.
[02:10:33.465 --> 02:10:35.306]  Yeah, when Jim Fetzer was on the stage.
[02:10:35.346 --> 02:10:36.647]  I bought Terror Storm, actually.
[02:10:36.707 --> 02:10:38.768]  I saw a little symposium at the end of it.
[02:10:39.341 --> 02:10:42.503]  Yeah, Jim Fetzer, he's a real good one to have on your staff there, buddy.
[02:10:42.763 --> 02:10:43.844]  Yeah, he's interesting, isn't he?
[02:10:43.944 --> 02:10:45.044]  Yeah.
[02:10:45.064 --> 02:10:49.427]  Yeah, well, you know... How would you have Morgan Reynolds in your movie?
[02:10:49.467 --> 02:10:51.828]  He doesn't think planes... Hey, let me ask you a question.
[02:10:52.548 --> 02:10:58.132]  You're tuning into the show on a daily basis and calling into most of the other shows.
[02:10:58.612 --> 02:11:00.193]  Well, I'm kind of laid off a bit.
[02:11:00.253 --> 02:11:01.894]  How do you do that when you're at work?
[02:11:03.074 --> 02:11:04.035]  Because I sit at a desk.
[02:11:05.934 --> 02:11:09.377]  You sit at a desk listening to my show and every other show.
[02:11:09.397 --> 02:11:11.239]  No, I listen to you and Jack Wood.
[02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:14.121]  I heard you calling to a bunch of other shows.
[02:11:14.141 --> 02:11:16.483]  I wouldn't have been during the day.
[02:11:16.683 --> 02:11:22.168]  You know, you called into my Sunday show two weeks ago and I said, is there a North American Union?
[02:11:22.208 --> 02:11:23.469]  Is Lou Dobbs a kook?
[02:11:23.849 --> 02:11:26.691]  And you said there's no North American Union and Lou Dobbs is a kook.
[02:11:27.232 --> 02:11:27.912]  This is Lou Dobbs.
[02:11:27.932 --> 02:11:28.853]  I didn't say Lou Dobbs.
[02:11:28.873 --> 02:11:29.253]  Hold on.
[02:11:29.494 --> 02:11:30.074]  Yeah, you did.
[02:11:30.194 --> 02:11:30.755]  Yes, you did.
[02:11:31.175 --> 02:11:32.616]  Well, hold on just a second, Troy.
[02:11:33.197 --> 02:11:34.558]  Is there a North American Union?
[02:11:35.461 --> 02:11:35.721]  No.
[02:11:36.642 --> 02:11:37.402]  Put him on hold.
[02:11:37.482 --> 02:11:38.823]  Here's Lou Dobbs last night.
[02:11:39.464 --> 02:11:46.229]  Tonight a proposal for an expanded so-called free trade zone from Alaska to the tip of South America.
[02:11:46.309 --> 02:11:56.376]  It's a plan from the business elites, the political elites, that will cost more American jobs, cost American sovereignty, but it would fulfill the President's father's mission.
[02:11:57.051 --> 02:11:57.971]  Bill Tucker reports.
[02:12:00.232 --> 02:12:01.313]  It's not a new idea.
[02:12:01.393 --> 02:12:03.474]  President Bush talked about it back in 1991.
[02:12:03.574 --> 02:12:05.775]  It is a big idea.
[02:12:06.875 --> 02:12:07.956]  A new world order.
[02:12:08.856 --> 02:12:13.158]  Where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause.
[02:12:13.738 --> 02:12:18.921]  Now former United States Trade Ambassador Robert Zoellick is talking about it again with renewed vigor.
[02:12:19.441 --> 02:12:24.163]  This time a new world order with business at the helm of trade and economic policy.
[02:12:24.683 --> 02:12:25.064]  Okay.
[02:12:26.551 --> 02:12:31.314]  Now, we're having our laws harmonized, our federal agencies merged, our social security merged.
[02:12:32.494 --> 02:12:42.560]  Our government is working with the Mexican government to give satellite navigation systems to 200,000 illegals to cross.
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:49.664]  I talked to you two weeks ago, Troy, or whatever your name is, and you said that there wasn't a North American Union.
[02:12:49.684 --> 02:12:50.784]  Are you still saying that?
[02:12:50.824 --> 02:12:51.985]  As far as I'm concerned, there ain't.
[02:12:54.327 --> 02:12:57.590]  The thing is, if I never listened to you, I wouldn't even know what the North American Union even meant.
[02:12:58.511 --> 02:13:04.758]  I could probably ask the next 50 people, if I go up to the street and flag down the next 50 cars and ask them, you know what the North American Union is?
[02:13:04.778 --> 02:13:06.280]  They'd have no idea what I mean.
[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:12.988]  Well, I bet if you flagged 100 people, 100 of them wouldn't know what a comprehensive annual financial report is.
[02:13:13.723 --> 02:13:14.283]  Probably not.
[02:13:14.803 --> 02:13:22.145]  I mean, I would doubt that maybe 1 out of 50 know what the theory of basic and the study of quantum mechanics is.
[02:13:22.605 --> 02:13:26.126]  Just because you don't know doesn't mean it's not important.
[02:13:27.486 --> 02:13:38.589]  Like, I bet you think I'm lying when I get up here on air and I say that every county, city, and water, and every government institution runs giant surpluses on a second set of books.
[02:13:40.990 --> 02:13:42.590]  I don't disagree with everything you say.
[02:13:44.279 --> 02:13:49.984]  You could be good at what you do, but you just went off the deep end sometime in your life.
[02:13:50.164 --> 02:13:51.425]  Oh yeah, I went off the deep end.
[02:13:51.526 --> 02:13:55.989]  The whole 9-11 thing, anything you say after that, I can't really believe too much of what you did.
[02:13:56.010 --> 02:13:57.110]  Well, let me ask you this, Troy.
[02:13:58.011 --> 02:14:02.916]  Do you think I'm making it up that DynCorp and Halliburton run child kidnapping rings?
[02:14:04.597 --> 02:14:05.558]  I don't believe that, no.
[02:14:05.578 --> 02:14:10.122]  Okay, how long do you think they would let me do that on air without suing me if it wasn't true?
[02:14:11.135 --> 02:14:15.839]  I mean, I'm on actual, you know, commercial AM and FM stations, a growing list of them.
[02:14:16.219 --> 02:14:21.543]  Okay, they let me get on national talk shows, okay, on 200, 300, 500 stations.
[02:14:21.823 --> 02:14:31.651]  They let me get on national TV, okay, because it's well known that I talk about real things, okay, and I back up what I'm talking about.
[02:14:31.831 --> 02:14:39.157]  And just because you haven't heard about it in your hillbilly circles doesn't mean it doesn't exist, Troy.
[02:14:42.185 --> 02:14:42.445]  Okay.
[02:14:42.465 --> 02:14:42.605]  Nope.
[02:14:42.625 --> 02:14:44.346]  I grew up in Charleston.
[02:14:44.386 --> 02:14:45.166]  I grew up in the city.
[02:14:45.186 --> 02:14:45.867]  I'm far from a hillbilly.
[02:14:45.927 --> 02:14:46.187]  I'm what?
[02:15:06.193 --> 02:15:06.734]  I'm sorry.
[02:15:07.194 --> 02:15:09.916]  Listen, man, I'm just... There's nothing wrong with hill people.
[02:15:09.956 --> 02:15:11.316]  I'm just teasing the old cliche.
[02:15:11.717 --> 02:15:13.558]  I need to play banjo deliverance music.
[02:15:14.158 --> 02:15:20.382]  Hey, man, listen to me.
[02:15:20.422 --> 02:15:21.003]  I'm from Texas.
[02:15:21.043 --> 02:15:21.623]  I'm a hillbilly.
[02:15:22.303 --> 02:15:22.924]  That's fine.
[02:15:23.164 --> 02:15:24.545]  That's fine with you.
[02:15:25.285 --> 02:15:28.407]  I mean, what is it specifically that I'm lying about here, Troy?
[02:15:28.427 --> 02:15:32.590]  I mean, did you just hear O'Reilly sing the world can't wait has 50 members?
[02:15:34.565 --> 02:15:38.347]  I thought he was talking about he had 50 members at that particular... I agree with that.
[02:16:01.357 --> 02:16:02.938]  I didn't catch that.
[02:16:03.439 --> 02:16:06.821]  I think he took the whole conversation out of context.
[02:16:07.001 --> 02:16:08.803]  He talked about the far left loons.
[02:16:09.063 --> 02:16:11.304]  Oh yeah, the far left loons.
[02:16:11.785 --> 02:16:13.746]  Well thank God for them.
[02:16:13.766 --> 02:16:15.087]  I appreciate your call, Troy.
[02:16:15.408 --> 02:16:21.432]  Thank God that they're not like the mainline scumbag Democrats who are just, well, we need to go ahead and continue the war now.
[02:16:21.472 --> 02:16:22.653]  At least we're running it.
[02:16:22.673 --> 02:16:24.274]  I like Hillary.
[02:16:24.314 --> 02:16:25.195]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:16:27.119 --> 02:16:31.740]  Why don't you just get past far-left loon, far-right loon, and just become an American?
[02:16:33.340 --> 02:16:35.640]  And you did say two weeks ago there's no North American Union.
[02:16:35.660 --> 02:16:36.621]  You said it again today.
[02:16:37.261 --> 02:16:39.001]  And you're living in a dream world.
[02:16:42.922 --> 02:16:44.322]  Don in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:16:44.362 --> 02:16:44.782]  Go ahead.
[02:16:44.802 --> 02:16:47.562]  How you doing?
[02:16:47.823 --> 02:16:48.203]  Good, sir.
[02:16:48.283 --> 02:16:48.883]  What's on your mind?
[02:16:49.183 --> 02:16:55.404]  Well, one of the things I was thinking about is that they're constantly being referred to, you know, the
[02:16:57.202 --> 02:16:59.002]  The powerful people as the elite.
[02:16:59.823 --> 02:17:00.843]  They're not elite.
[02:17:00.943 --> 02:17:07.824]  That designation or semantics makes a lot of people feel like, well, they're superior.
[02:17:07.844 --> 02:17:08.364]  Well, no.
[02:17:08.384 --> 02:17:15.966]  I mean, if you say measured the size of detritus in a latrine as the bigger pieces being elite, there would be elite pieces in there.
[02:17:16.306 --> 02:17:19.387]  Well, the Palestinians, for instance, are in, you might say, a
[02:17:21.546 --> 02:17:27.609]  They really are, but they should just learn to accept it and die, because they're evil.
[02:17:27.649 --> 02:17:39.334]  The patriotic Americans are being herded into the idea of being Anglo-Saxon, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, militia people.
[02:17:39.674 --> 02:17:48.819]  It's like they always talk about, they go out there and bomb the militias, the suspected militias and suspected dissidents in the
[02:17:49.755 --> 02:17:53.418]  The American people feel like, well, this is wonderful.
[02:17:53.639 --> 02:17:56.621]  We don't mind murdering peaceful shepherds.
[02:17:56.761 --> 02:17:58.723]  Well, actually, the American people are not for that.
[02:17:58.783 --> 02:18:04.627]  So you buy into O'Reilly saying the majority... I don't mean... He's a disgusting creep.
[02:18:06.129 --> 02:18:07.730]  Okay, well, let me stop you.
[02:18:07.770 --> 02:18:10.272]  What I'm saying is, sir, the majority do not
[02:18:11.016 --> 02:18:13.837]  Okay, the majority don't want toll roads on existing roads.
[02:18:13.857 --> 02:18:15.097]  The majority don't want open borders.
[02:18:15.317 --> 02:18:16.637]  The majority don't want the war.
[02:18:16.917 --> 02:18:19.418]  They set up on TV and say the majority does.
[02:18:19.818 --> 02:18:21.739]  Well, you might tell you how they do that.
[02:18:22.079 --> 02:18:28.160]  Extortion and fear is what makes a lot of people be fearful of even saying anything.
[02:18:28.180 --> 02:18:31.461]  It's like if you're in a big corporation or a big factory, you don't want to
[02:18:32.385 --> 02:18:37.409]  Yeah, that's why companies fire people to talk about 9-11 men and inside jobs.
[02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:38.630]  Universities do.
[02:18:39.250 --> 02:18:41.312]  They want to make an example.
[02:18:41.332 --> 02:18:42.533]  They're intimidating us.
[02:18:42.853 --> 02:18:49.718]  And if people like being serfs on a plantation, being intimidated and being run by a gang boss, then enjoy your slavery.
[02:18:49.758 --> 02:18:54.761]  Just don't say you're free, don't say you're Americans, and don't festoon yourself with American flags.
[02:18:54.982 --> 02:19:00.826]  Well, the idea of the India caste system, or the English, you know,
[02:19:01.266 --> 02:19:01.966]  I think so, yes.
[02:19:27.869 --> 02:19:28.770]  No, no, I agree.
[02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:30.492]  No offensive violence.
[02:19:30.512 --> 02:19:31.713]  We should all defend ourselves.
[02:19:31.773 --> 02:19:32.854]  It's our God-given right.
[02:19:32.934 --> 02:19:37.078]  But that's why they blow up buildings and stage events and try to blame it on patriot groups.
[02:19:37.378 --> 02:19:39.220]  It's because they want to make it a violent game.
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:42.743]  We need to expose them as the violent pieces of trash they are.
[02:19:43.383 --> 02:19:48.626]  We need to just say no to their system and literally put ourselves against the machinery.
[02:19:48.666 --> 02:19:50.047]  Let me tell you something, Don.
[02:19:50.487 --> 02:19:52.488]  I want you to know we're winning, okay?
[02:19:52.728 --> 02:19:54.389]  People are waking up in droves.
[02:19:54.730 --> 02:19:56.391]  The New World Order is in crisis.
[02:19:56.411 --> 02:20:01.013]  That's why they tried to put the Democrats in and now they've got them trying to sell us on staying in the war.
[02:20:01.033 --> 02:20:01.954]  That's not working.
[02:20:03.154 --> 02:20:06.956]  Everybody I know in the left is waking up and not being in the left anymore.
[02:20:07.837 --> 02:20:08.978]  They're out buying guns.
[02:20:08.998 --> 02:20:10.438]  They're out hating the New World Order.
[02:20:10.458 --> 02:20:11.319]  They're out getting it.
[02:20:12.162 --> 02:20:13.683]  I talked to the illegal aliens.
[02:20:13.923 --> 02:20:14.884]  You can even wake them up.
[02:20:15.785 --> 02:20:17.566]  The conservatives are waking up.
[02:20:17.966 --> 02:20:22.750]  There's still a hardcore of them, though, that think gun control and open borders and world government is conservative.
[02:20:23.390 --> 02:20:23.991]  And it's not!
[02:20:24.711 --> 02:20:25.432]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:25.472 --> 02:20:25.832]  Stay with me.
[02:20:30.789 --> 02:20:35.754]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[02:21:29.941 --> 02:21:32.422]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:21:32.522 --> 02:21:39.346]  Did you know that at the 29 Palms Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marine Station there?
[02:21:40.067 --> 02:21:43.349]  It discussed the United States military under UN command.
[02:21:44.079 --> 02:21:45.540]  Would the Marines accept this?
[02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:56.506]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[02:21:56.966 --> 02:21:58.367]  Is this what Americans want?
[02:21:58.507 --> 02:22:00.308]  Forced confiscation of guns?
[02:22:00.828 --> 02:22:08.332]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:22:30.074 --> 02:22:33.976]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:22:34.196 --> 02:22:46.463]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:22:46.903 --> 02:22:47.303]  The U.S.
[02:22:47.343 --> 02:22:52.926]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:22:53.326 --> 02:22:55.527]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:22:57.388 --> 02:22:58.449]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:22:58.489 --> 02:23:01.330]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:23:01.450 --> 02:23:07.473]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:23:07.893 --> 02:23:11.255]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[02:23:11.335 --> 02:23:17.678]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[02:23:18.218 --> 02:23:22.122]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[02:23:22.142 --> 02:23:22.342]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:22.362 --> 02:23:22.623]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:31.495 --> 02:23:32.335]  Come on, Bill.
[02:23:32.536 --> 02:23:37.760]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[02:23:38.121 --> 02:23:39.622]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[02:23:39.702 --> 02:23:41.704]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:23:42.004 --> 02:23:47.549]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:23:47.869 --> 02:23:54.155]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:23:54.495 --> 02:23:56.697]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:23:56.997 --> 02:24:00.461]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[02:24:00.702 --> 02:24:01.082]  Whoa.
[02:24:01.522 --> 02:24:02.684]  What was that website again?
[02:24:02.704 --> 02:24:06.308]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:24:06.628 --> 02:24:07.750]  Now write this down, John.
[02:24:07.890 --> 02:24:12.235]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:24:12.395 --> 02:24:12.956]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:24:13.256 --> 02:24:14.437]  I'm going there right now.
[02:24:14.898 --> 02:24:15.539]  Check, please.
[02:24:17.289 --> 02:24:18.810]  Uh, you got this one, right Bill?
[02:24:19.291 --> 02:24:19.871]  Sure, John.
[02:24:20.091 --> 02:24:24.474]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:24:24.795 --> 02:24:26.536]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:24:26.676 --> 02:24:27.016]  Deal.
[02:24:35.202 --> 02:24:37.103]  Waging war on corruption.

[02:24:41.548 --> 02:24:44.730]  Crashing for the lies and disinformation.
[02:24:45.470 --> 02:24:47.931]  Waging war on the New World Order.
[02:24:50.212 --> 02:24:51.713]  Huge news blitz coming up.
[02:24:51.733 --> 02:24:53.053]  Let's move fast through your calls.
[02:24:53.213 --> 02:24:54.314]  Wolf in Utah.
[02:24:54.794 --> 02:24:55.994]  You're on the air, welcome.
[02:24:56.715 --> 02:24:57.935]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:24:57.975 --> 02:24:58.355]  Good, sir.
[02:24:59.196 --> 02:25:02.697]  Listen, first of all, I wanted to say amen to you and Ms.
[02:25:02.757 --> 02:25:03.158]  Taylor.
[02:25:04.338 --> 02:25:10.841]  And also I wish Lieutenant Wakata's father was still with you so he could hear me say, I hope he's listening,
[02:25:11.573 --> 02:25:19.837]  How proud I am, and millions of Americans are, of his true patriot, true hero son.
[02:25:23.319 --> 02:25:24.339]  Yeah, it was great, wasn't it?
[02:25:24.419 --> 02:25:27.220]  I mean, we're really glad people were standing up against this evil war.
[02:25:28.301 --> 02:25:28.721]  Amen.
[02:25:30.062 --> 02:25:30.802]  You're so right.
[02:25:32.003 --> 02:25:34.124]  And that guy Troy, he makes me crack up.
[02:25:34.804 --> 02:25:35.444]  But you know what?
[02:25:35.504 --> 02:25:36.925]  I think you're starting to wake him up.
[02:25:38.649 --> 02:25:39.750]  Don't you get that impression?
[02:25:40.010 --> 02:25:40.611]  I don't know, man.
[02:25:40.651 --> 02:25:41.851]  I can't get that guy's number.
[02:25:43.793 --> 02:25:46.755]  He's like, I just think you went off the deep end a little too much.
[02:25:46.775 --> 02:25:48.797]  The whole society went off the deep end.
[02:25:49.257 --> 02:25:49.457]  Yep.
[02:25:50.158 --> 02:25:52.119]  I mean, the stuff that's happening is crazy.
[02:25:52.620 --> 02:25:56.963]  I can't blame people not believing it's happening, but when the evidence is there, get out of denial.
[02:25:57.744 --> 02:25:58.084]  Amen.
[02:25:59.385 --> 02:26:00.065]  You're so right.
[02:26:00.306 --> 02:26:01.527]  All right, good to hear from you, Wolf.
[02:26:01.587 --> 02:26:02.487]  I appreciate you holding.
[02:26:02.928 --> 02:26:05.750]  Joe, Joe, where are you calling from today?
[02:26:06.468 --> 02:26:07.128]  Pittsburgh!
[02:26:07.489 --> 02:26:08.069]  Hello!
[02:26:08.429 --> 02:26:09.510]  Wolfpack Leader Jones.
[02:26:09.530 --> 02:26:11.330]  How you doing?
[02:26:12.371 --> 02:26:18.094]  Alright, well, yeah, first of all, Troy, yeah, he's definitely good for a chuckle.
[02:26:18.114 --> 02:26:24.537]  He kind of puts a voice to, you know, the invincible ignorance of the population.
[02:26:24.557 --> 02:26:27.078]  That's a good term, invincible ignorance.
[02:26:27.638 --> 02:26:29.519]  Yeah, I think I've heard you say that or somebody else.
[02:26:29.579 --> 02:26:30.980]  Yeah, no, I've used it.
[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:32.081]  It's a good one.
[02:26:33.641 --> 02:26:41.185]  My question for you today was about Calm Trails.
[02:26:41.465 --> 02:26:43.026]  Everybody knows how the government is.
[02:26:43.406 --> 02:26:49.670]  Well, all I know is until 1996, trails disappeared in seconds, now they stay there for hours sometimes.
[02:26:50.690 --> 02:26:55.233]  The government now in textbooks says it's part of some program to keep us safe, so who knows what it is.
[02:26:56.313 --> 02:26:57.554]  I'm sure it's good for us, though.
[02:26:57.594 --> 02:26:59.715]  Our government would only do good, so I trust them.
[02:27:00.575 --> 02:27:02.296]  I'd like to advance my theory about them.
[02:27:02.456 --> 02:27:03.856]  I think they serve two purposes.
[02:27:04.256 --> 02:27:07.317]  First of all, I think there's a... It's a multivitamin spray.
[02:27:08.197 --> 02:27:09.878]  Yeah, something to that effect.
[02:27:09.898 --> 02:27:23.061]  There's a biological effect to it, because... I believe that there's a biological effect to it, but more than that, do you see any correlation between the higher temperatures that are going on in the country now with that?
[02:27:23.422 --> 02:27:24.102]  Well, I know this.
[02:27:24.262 --> 02:27:27.383]  NASA has reported that the world is 20% darker
[02:27:29.463 --> 02:27:31.304]  Than it was ten years ago.
[02:27:32.104 --> 02:27:39.468]  And now all satellite photos show these trails everywhere, and photos previous to 1995-96 do not.
[02:27:41.268 --> 02:27:44.410]  And it is altering the atmosphere, and it is holding in heat.
[02:27:45.650 --> 02:27:49.872]  And now in government textbooks they say they're giving us a quote, sunscreen.
[02:27:50.412 --> 02:27:51.253]  Screening the Earth.
[02:27:51.733 --> 02:27:55.775]  Something weird's going on, and we've had guests on about the subject, and it's weird.
[02:27:58.174 --> 02:28:01.817]  I mean, it scares me, because I know how the government... Don't be scared.
[02:28:01.897 --> 02:28:04.058]  They helped those black men with syphilis, didn't they?
[02:28:04.099 --> 02:28:06.821]  And they helped all those atomic soldiers and children.
[02:28:07.561 --> 02:28:11.084]  This is a nice government that radiated American children to test radiation on them.
[02:28:11.104 --> 02:28:12.024]  These are good people.
[02:28:12.785 --> 02:28:19.810]  Actually, I go out of my house on most days, at least every other day, and I see lines of these planes go through the air, parallel to each other.
[02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:23.613]  And they're just putting something up there that doesn't disappear.
[02:28:23.633 --> 02:28:25.795]  And I remember when I was a kid, with my mother,
[02:28:26.593 --> 02:28:29.576]  Yeah, looking up at the sky in the summer and seeing those planes.
[02:28:29.636 --> 02:28:33.479]  We used to call them sky riders, because they rode in the sky, but the trail always disappeared.
[02:28:33.499 --> 02:28:43.288]  I remember... Well, listen, a few weeks ago, it was a holiday, so they were taking a break, and I was out at the park with some people at work, and we said, let's go take a break, go to the park for an hour.
[02:28:43.869 --> 02:28:44.990]  So we're out there eating lunch.
[02:28:45.848 --> 02:28:49.130]  And the jets were flying by, and they were leaving a trail that disappeared in 30 seconds.
[02:28:49.730 --> 02:28:51.672]  And I said, oh, that's the old-fashioned type.
[02:28:53.052 --> 02:28:56.314]  Now they're lower than ice crystals can even form.
[02:28:56.354 --> 02:29:00.677]  I mean, they'll have chemtrails at 4,000 feet, these aerosols.
[02:29:01.717 --> 02:29:04.519]  And it's just horrible.
[02:29:05.039 --> 02:29:07.421]  There's all sorts of freakish stuff going on, man.
[02:29:08.021 --> 02:29:09.342]  I mean, that's the point.
[02:29:09.362 --> 02:29:14.485]  You've got a shadow government with almost as much funds as the public government.
[02:29:16.651 --> 02:29:18.051]  Ward knows what they're doing.
[02:29:18.071 --> 02:29:22.293]  I appreciate your call.
[02:29:22.773 --> 02:29:23.133]  I hear you.
[02:29:23.173 --> 02:29:23.693]  It's crazy.
[02:29:24.313 --> 02:29:25.814]  Let's talk to Don in Nebraska.
[02:29:25.854 --> 02:29:26.674]  Don, you're on the air.
[02:29:27.134 --> 02:29:28.354]  Alex, great job.
[02:29:28.774 --> 02:29:30.095]  You are a great American.
[02:29:31.355 --> 02:29:32.916]  Well, I'm just doing my duty, my friend.
[02:29:32.976 --> 02:29:33.456]  That's great.
[02:29:33.616 --> 02:29:34.456]  Somebody's got to do it.
[02:29:34.596 --> 02:29:35.256]  You stepped up.
[02:29:35.316 --> 02:29:35.696]  You did it.
[02:29:36.317 --> 02:29:36.817]  I'm awake.
[02:29:36.997 --> 02:29:37.817]  I took the red pill.
[02:29:37.877 --> 02:29:39.257]  I'm waking up everybody else.
[02:29:39.998 --> 02:29:45.139]  I got for Christmas a DVD burner and the Freedom Fascism and the Terror Storm combo.
[02:29:46.204 --> 02:29:46.904]  And I spread out.
[02:29:47.184 --> 02:29:48.625]  I've woken up three other people already.
[02:29:50.245 --> 02:29:50.645]  Good.
[02:29:50.945 --> 02:29:53.886]  I mean, look, we need to aggressively be getting the word out.
[02:29:54.246 --> 02:29:56.027]  Oh, I've made more copies.
[02:29:56.327 --> 02:29:59.548]  You notice how the operatives, like the poo-poo, is making copies of videos?
[02:29:59.828 --> 02:30:00.068]  Oh, yeah.
[02:30:00.088 --> 02:30:01.328]  They like to say it's ineffective.
[02:30:01.628 --> 02:30:08.951]  You'll see how ineffective it is down there at CENTCOM when we defend America from you terrorists who've been bought up by the private foreign banks.
[02:30:09.351 --> 02:30:09.851]  Stay there, Don.
[02:30:09.871 --> 02:30:11.111]  I'll let you finish up on the other side.
[02:30:11.391 --> 02:30:13.872]  You're going to find out how effective we are, traitors!
[02:30:14.767 --> 02:30:16.628]  We're coming for you, you traitors!
[02:30:20.829 --> 02:30:21.730]  We're on the march.
[02:30:22.230 --> 02:30:23.830]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:24.731 --> 02:30:27.452]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:31.934 --> 02:30:34.515]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:30:34.675 --> 02:30:36.816]  When was the last time you used Pure Soap?
[02:30:37.116 --> 02:30:47.199]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:30:47.499 --> 02:30:49.900]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[02:31:17.799 --> 02:31:20.323]  Call today for a Calvin Soap catalog at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:31:20.343 --> 02:31:22.325]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at CalvinPureSoap.com.
[02:31:30.660 --> 02:31:35.222]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:31:35.622 --> 02:31:38.564]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:31:38.884 --> 02:31:41.445]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:31:41.805 --> 02:31:46.627]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:31:47.007 --> 02:31:52.370]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:31:52.670 --> 02:31:55.631]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:31:55.831 --> 02:31:56.391]  We're good to go.
[02:32:19.019 --> 02:32:19.879]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[02:32:19.919 --> 02:32:26.523]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[02:32:26.543 --> 02:32:32.266]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[02:32:47.914 --> 02:32:55.357]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[02:32:55.677 --> 02:33:01.038]  Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag.
[02:33:01.339 --> 02:33:05.260]  Each memorial marker is specifically designed to represent one of 15 wars.
[02:33:05.560 --> 02:33:11.782]  All markers include a three-eighths inch pointed and threaded aluminum rod, painted and highlighted for an appearance that is unforgettable.
[02:33:12.062 --> 02:33:14.803]  What better way to pay homage to our enlisted loved ones
[02:33:15.103 --> 02:33:15.624]  That's right.
[02:33:51.056 --> 02:33:53.178]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:54.059 --> 02:33:55.440]  Continuing with your phone calls.
[02:33:57.242 --> 02:34:00.625]  When I talk about traitors, this is not our government.
[02:34:00.685 --> 02:34:02.867]  It's been bought and paid for by foreign interests.
[02:34:02.907 --> 02:34:08.152]  They use us for whatever wishes they want, while they dismantle our country's sovereignty.
[02:34:08.272 --> 02:34:09.413]  That is treason.
[02:34:10.054 --> 02:34:13.597]  The North American Union is treason by any yardstick.
[02:34:15.035 --> 02:34:18.456]  Okay, Bush is guilty of high treason.
[02:34:18.836 --> 02:34:19.757]  Period.
[02:34:20.257 --> 02:34:23.578]  For signing the North American Union in March of 2005.
[02:34:25.679 --> 02:34:26.219]  Period.
[02:34:27.279 --> 02:34:28.320]  End of discussion.
[02:34:31.181 --> 02:34:34.182]  And you can't just debate these issues, you know, separately.
[02:34:34.462 --> 02:34:38.823]  Well, I say the war is good, because the Islamofascists all want to kill us.
[02:34:38.863 --> 02:34:40.684]  You saw what happened on 9-11.
[02:34:40.864 --> 02:34:42.785]  Yeah, we saw the feds.
[02:34:46.104 --> 02:34:46.744]  Hey, I just want to
[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:09.662]  Well, his real name is Weiner and he wrote
[02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:28.222]  He wrote love story novels about men lavishing each other.
[02:35:28.482 --> 02:35:30.923]  He's a beatnik ball of scum.
[02:35:31.003 --> 02:35:31.643]  Oh, I know that.
[02:35:31.663 --> 02:35:32.283]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:35:32.423 --> 02:35:34.424]  That's why he's a neocon.
[02:35:34.484 --> 02:35:36.405]  I mean, you've got to be into that to be one, really.
[02:35:36.725 --> 02:35:38.006]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:35:39.366 --> 02:35:48.830]  Oh, lo and behold, what you've been talking about for the past year, cutting up Iraq and dividing up among the oil companies and the barons, he has started spouting off about that now, too.
[02:35:50.664 --> 02:35:51.844]  But is he saying it's a good thing?
[02:35:52.305 --> 02:35:53.385]  No, he's saying it's a bad thing.
[02:35:53.845 --> 02:35:55.846]  See, he's jumping on the Alex Jones bandwagon now.
[02:35:57.526 --> 02:36:02.527]  I wonder if he'll start writing novels again about laying on the beach with other men in Tahiti lavishing.
[02:36:05.008 --> 02:36:09.409]  Maybe not Tahiti, but maybe part of Mexico, Corpus Christi, or you know.
[02:36:10.249 --> 02:36:12.730]  Well, I mean, my whole thing is if that's his business, that's fine.
[02:36:12.790 --> 02:36:15.611]  I just don't get how all these guys act like they're conservative.
[02:36:16.238 --> 02:36:19.079]  And I just don't know if their listeners know who they really are, that's all.
[02:36:19.639 --> 02:36:20.199]  No, they don't.
[02:36:20.339 --> 02:36:24.280]  And I've read all the information about who he really is and what he really stands for.
[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:24.580]  Yeah.
[02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:25.861]  Well, have you looked into him?
[02:36:25.921 --> 02:36:29.202]  I mean, this guy's quite a stinker.
[02:36:29.902 --> 02:36:30.342]  Oh, really?
[02:36:31.382 --> 02:36:36.644]  I haven't really looked into him a whole lot, but... Well, I mean, he's something else, man.
[02:36:37.124 --> 02:36:37.824]  He's something else.
[02:36:37.844 --> 02:36:38.904]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:36:39.585 --> 02:36:44.626]  And... I mean, I haven't listened to Savage probably in about a year.
[02:36:45.603 --> 02:36:46.644]  That's how busy I am.
[02:36:47.705 --> 02:36:49.767]  But he comes on around here in the afternoon.
[02:36:49.788 --> 02:36:51.589]  I ought to tune into it.
[02:36:53.371 --> 02:36:54.192]  And I'm not kidding.
[02:36:54.332 --> 02:36:57.436]  Every time I tune in for a few months straight, I tune in every few days.
[02:36:58.537 --> 02:37:01.360]  When I turn the radio on, he was always saying it.
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:03.001]  So it must be like that's all he says.
[02:37:04.303 --> 02:37:07.246]  Or maybe I was just unlucky enough to always tune in when I had to hear it.
[02:37:08.391 --> 02:37:30.140]  About how we need to put everybody in FEMA camps that disagrees with the government, and everybody needs to go to concentration camps, and there's going to be another terror attack, and we're all going to go to concentration camps, and that we shouldn't have to feed the people in concentration camps, so they should be slave camps where we have to work, and that anyone who disagrees with the war is aiding Al-Qaeda and is a terrorist, and just...
[02:37:32.474 --> 02:37:41.928]  On, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and then Bush is fighting the New World Order by fighting the Muslims?
[02:37:43.070 --> 02:37:45.654]  Bush's daddy announced the New World Order!
[02:37:49.037 --> 02:37:52.680]  I mean, you tune into that stuff and I'll never forget him going, you just watch.
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:55.321]  There's going to be another terror attack.
[02:37:55.742 --> 02:37:58.484]  And when there is, we're arresting all of you.
[02:37:59.985 --> 02:38:00.905]  I mean, they know.
[02:38:00.985 --> 02:38:02.887]  People like him know what the game plan is.
[02:38:03.227 --> 02:38:05.689]  Their bosses will stage another attack and then the other.
[02:38:06.429 --> 02:38:07.730]  They think they're going to get away with it.
[02:38:08.931 --> 02:38:12.894]  I assure them when they end up losing, they're going to have to pay the piper.
[02:38:14.355 --> 02:38:16.256]  He will pay the piper when we win.
[02:38:17.893 --> 02:38:20.634]  We are going to indict the propagandists.
[02:38:20.654 --> 02:38:26.036]  We're going to go in and get the federal records of the hundreds of thousands of media people that have been on the payroll.
[02:38:27.156 --> 02:38:30.798]  And every single one of them is going to go before a jury of their peers.
[02:38:31.518 --> 02:38:35.359]  And quite a few of you that are on government payroll are going to spend a long time in federal prison.
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:37.140]  Okay?
[02:38:37.180 --> 02:38:37.920]  You need to know that.
[02:38:38.220 --> 02:38:46.183]  And if your bosses are able to carry out mass arrests and exterminations, which they're probably going to be able to do until we finally whoop them,
[02:38:48.477 --> 02:38:53.501]  Then you're going to be held accountable for calling for it, and you're going to be in there in the war crimes trials.
[02:38:55.102 --> 02:39:01.086]  And you can beg and you can plead, but when you're found guilty of murder, you're going to go to the gallows.
[02:39:03.167 --> 02:39:06.130]  So, you need to understand that.
[02:39:06.170 --> 02:39:07.410]  You're going to be held accountable.
[02:39:09.552 --> 02:39:13.915]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Guy in California.
[02:39:13.955 --> 02:39:15.016]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:39:17.423 --> 02:39:18.003]  Yes, hello.
[02:39:18.063 --> 02:39:18.743]  Gary, sorry.
[02:39:18.783 --> 02:39:19.404]  Go ahead, Gary.
[02:39:19.584 --> 02:39:20.444]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[02:39:20.944 --> 02:39:21.284]  Hi.
[02:39:22.484 --> 02:39:23.145]  God bless you.
[02:39:23.345 --> 02:39:24.245]  I just want to say that.
[02:39:24.345 --> 02:39:24.785]  Thank you.
[02:39:24.945 --> 02:39:25.685]  God bless you.
[02:39:25.705 --> 02:39:26.325]  What's on your mind?
[02:39:27.086 --> 02:39:27.966]  Several things.
[02:39:28.986 --> 02:39:41.610]  You know, I would say recently, you know, listening to a lot of what you had to say and being kind of a skeptic and a person that sort of wants to connect the dots for myself.
[02:39:42.850 --> 02:39:46.311]  And I have to tell you, my friend, that
[02:39:48.321 --> 02:40:02.051]  You know, it sounds fantastic, but a lot of, in fact, most of everything what you say, I cannot refute as much as I tried to find contrary evidence.
[02:40:02.611 --> 02:40:04.232]  And please, when you find it, let me know.
[02:40:04.252 --> 02:40:06.254]  Because I don't want to work this hard.
[02:40:06.314 --> 02:40:07.154]  I don't want to do this.
[02:40:07.214 --> 02:40:08.295]  I don't want to risk my life.
[02:40:08.355 --> 02:40:14.860]  Let me tell you, what's on the internet, and I think people are not using it for the tool that it really is,
[02:40:16.063 --> 02:40:22.725]  There's another Alex, and I have to say that you're the one that started me on this journey, and I call it the journey down the rabbit hole.
[02:40:22.905 --> 02:40:25.405]  Everything's a lie on the Internet!
[02:40:26.325 --> 02:40:29.026]  All you can believe is Bill O'Reiler!
[02:40:29.926 --> 02:40:41.049]  No, in fact, I realize the only way you can get the true dissemination of the truth is now you have to rely on the Internet, because the media is completely confused.
[02:40:41.069 --> 02:40:42.149]  Well, people get confused.
[02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:45.772]  They have mainstream media all the time telling the truth.
[02:40:45.792 --> 02:40:46.753]  They're not all controlled.
[02:40:47.033 --> 02:40:48.234]  But it's regionalized.
[02:40:48.674 --> 02:40:54.638]  We take the regionalized news and then we nationalize it and globalize it so you're able to see a pattern.
[02:40:54.658 --> 02:40:58.421]  And we go get legislation and we write articles and we make a claim.
[02:40:58.821 --> 02:41:04.345]  And I found alternative researchers, if they're good, are neurotic about every claim we make we point out.
[02:41:04.805 --> 02:41:07.527]  Well, that's what we do, and that's why we've been successful.
[02:41:07.587 --> 02:41:08.548]  Let me say this, Alex.
[02:41:09.369 --> 02:41:12.271]  I know some of the things, like, you know, real legitimate sources.
[02:41:12.351 --> 02:41:21.358]  Carl Bernstein has said that over 400 mainstream media is controlled by the CIA, and he lists names, and it's right on Wikipedia.
[02:41:22.179 --> 02:41:23.480]  So that's quite interesting.
[02:41:23.540 --> 02:41:30.005]  And the other thing is, and you've mentioned this, and it really kind of caused me to think, is the dumbing down of America.
[02:41:31.056 --> 02:41:39.978]  I don't know if it was your show or one like it where they recently asked 70% of high school graduates who the vice president was and they could not answer it correctly.
[02:41:40.978 --> 02:41:43.018]  Now I tested this theory myself the other night.
[02:41:43.058 --> 02:41:49.259]  I drove to a fast food restaurant and a kid about 19 working behind the window and I just said, do you mind if I ask you a question?
[02:41:49.319 --> 02:41:49.899]  And he said, sure.
[02:41:49.959 --> 02:41:51.380]  And I said, who is the vice president?
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:52.660]  And do you know, he could not tell me.
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:55.660]  Now this is pretty scary stuff.
[02:41:56.481 --> 02:41:59.101]  It was done by design every bit of it.
[02:41:59.767 --> 02:42:06.673]  No, I blog quite a bit, and I've been posting because your videos are all available on YouTube.
[02:42:06.993 --> 02:42:09.335]  All of them.
[02:42:09.435 --> 02:42:11.797]  The Bohemian Grove, all of that.
[02:42:12.898 --> 02:42:19.404]  Your great interview with that Nazi guy, Gergen.
[02:42:21.846 --> 02:42:22.607]  That was classic.
[02:42:22.647 --> 02:42:25.769]  Now, I post that stuff and people will refute what they see with their own eyes.
[02:42:25.930 --> 02:42:27.511]  It's amazing how much I get attacked.
[02:42:29.591 --> 02:42:32.013]  Dick Cheney didn't say he was a member of the CFR.
[02:42:32.654 --> 02:42:33.594]  Well, let me tell you.
[02:42:33.614 --> 02:42:45.323]  I don't understand why a guy like Richard Perle, a non-government official, unelected, would have a private office in the Pentagon.
[02:42:45.783 --> 02:42:48.926]  Well, that's because he's a foreign Mossad agent.
[02:42:49.855 --> 02:42:53.037]  So they're first-class citizens here in the U.S.
[02:42:53.357 --> 02:42:54.638]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:42:55.038 --> 02:42:55.998]  Good to hear from you, man.
[02:42:56.018 --> 02:42:56.959]  Glad to have you on board.
[02:42:57.739 --> 02:42:59.800]  Let's go to Skip in California.
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:01.181]  Skip, you're on the air.
[02:43:01.201 --> 02:43:03.883]  Hey, I just have a couple of quick points.
[02:43:04.023 --> 02:43:06.164]  One is a possible show suggestion.
[02:43:06.184 --> 02:43:17.570]  Do you think you'd be willing to do a broadcast just for those people in the government that listen to your show and basically tell them
[02:43:18.570 --> 02:43:23.133]  Hey, don't you realize they're gonna... everything they're gonna do to us, they're gonna do to you?
[02:43:23.593 --> 02:43:30.517]  And then just have a bunch of examples of people like Saddam, who was a CIA operative, and in the end, he got what he deserved?
[02:43:30.537 --> 02:43:32.018]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:43:33.119 --> 02:43:36.220]  Yeah, well, there's not... most people in the government now know the truth.
[02:43:36.260 --> 02:43:37.121]  See, that's the thing.
[02:43:37.701 --> 02:43:40.183]  But there are people out there who are just weak-minded.
[02:43:41.034 --> 02:43:48.958]  And they don't listen to radio, or they listen to Limbaugh, or maybe they watch a little O'Reilly, but for the rest of the time they're out at the country bar getting drunk.
[02:43:49.698 --> 02:43:55.881]  So, I mean, to them, again, they're that group of 70% that don't know who the Vice President is.
[02:43:57.381 --> 02:44:08.466]  And it's scary, but, I mean, really, we have to get to the point where we realize it is a minority that rules us, and a minority of brainwashed idiots that enforce for them.
[02:44:09.381 --> 02:44:12.682]  And so, yeah, I mean, I think it is important to speak to people in government.
[02:44:12.922 --> 02:44:14.543]  But most people in government are awake.
[02:44:14.563 --> 02:44:19.865]  They're just compartmentalized and powerless, like everybody else that is powerless in the system.
[02:44:20.205 --> 02:44:29.168]  We do have power, though, to continue to wake up those that aren't fully awake, to continue to educate those further that are educated, and to aggressively move forward
[02:44:29.648 --> 02:44:31.429]  And people know something's wrong.
[02:44:31.490 --> 02:44:33.491]  They don't know how bad it really is.
[02:44:33.971 --> 02:44:39.456]  I'm here to get people to realize that it's not just good ol' boy corruption, and it's not just George Bush.
[02:44:39.956 --> 02:44:47.321]  It is a predatory system where evil and wickedness and ruthlessness is honored.
[02:44:47.562 --> 02:44:49.463]  They try to one-up each other.
[02:44:49.503 --> 02:44:50.744]  They see it as an attribute.
[02:44:51.645 --> 02:44:52.886]  They are a cancer, folks.
[02:44:52.986 --> 02:44:54.667]  The world has cancer.
[02:44:55.470 --> 02:44:59.613]  And I'm trying to get us just to admit we have it, so we can cut it out.
[02:44:59.653 --> 02:45:00.134]  Anything else?
[02:45:01.295 --> 02:45:04.557]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment on everyone's favorite caller, Troy.
[02:45:04.577 --> 02:45:14.425]  I think there's only one reason that he can debate you and deny what you're saying, because he doesn't do any investigation.
[02:45:15.246 --> 02:45:19.049]  And when he doesn't see for himself or try to do the research,
[02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:23.121]  The information hasn't been presented to him, and that's why he denies it.
[02:45:23.401 --> 02:45:33.245]  But everyone that I've talked to about this that says I'm a conspiracy terrorist, I get them to watch Freedom to Fascism, they don't debate it.
[02:45:34.106 --> 02:45:41.068]  Then I get them to watch TerrorStorm, and I think a lot of people in the end have to agree with what I'm saying.
[02:45:42.169 --> 02:45:47.991]  But if anything, some people just get afraid at that point in time, and they don't want to know anymore, and it's kind of like
[02:45:48.869 --> 02:45:49.769]  That's okay.
[02:45:49.829 --> 02:45:51.910]  Listen, most people have always been cowards.
[02:45:51.990 --> 02:45:53.230]  Jellyfish, furniture.
[02:45:53.610 --> 02:45:55.150]  Most people aren't involved in history.
[02:45:55.470 --> 02:45:57.031]  They live their lives.
[02:45:58.191 --> 02:45:59.611]  They don't affect anything.
[02:45:59.771 --> 02:46:01.332]  They don't ever really live and they die.
[02:46:01.432 --> 02:46:02.392]  No one remembers them.
[02:46:02.712 --> 02:46:03.752]  They never really lived.
[02:46:04.072 --> 02:46:04.812]  Their furniture.
[02:46:05.113 --> 02:46:10.554]  It's 5% on our side and 5% on the evil side that are going to decide the contest.
[02:46:10.794 --> 02:46:11.674]  The Battle Royal.
[02:46:12.538 --> 02:46:17.924]  And we've got our force, and we're growing our force, and we're going to defeat them, and they know it.
[02:46:18.004 --> 02:46:18.945]  I appreciate your call.
[02:46:20.706 --> 02:46:26.032]  They've tried their best to wreck our society and use high-tech weapons on us and poison the water and everything else.
[02:46:26.092 --> 02:46:27.153]  It's just not going to work.
[02:46:28.154 --> 02:46:28.995]  It's not going to work.
[02:46:29.015 --> 02:46:29.635]  They're going to fail.
[02:46:30.816 --> 02:46:32.158]  We are taking this country back.
[02:46:32.198 --> 02:46:33.319]  We are defending the Republic.
[02:46:34.099 --> 02:46:35.379]  We are going to shut down the borders.
[02:46:35.399 --> 02:46:36.880]  We're going to deport the illegal aliens.
[02:46:37.300 --> 02:46:39.641]  We're going to kick out the Federal Reserve.
[02:46:39.961 --> 02:46:41.181]  We're going to arrest the traitors.
[02:46:41.301 --> 02:46:42.661]  We have to start believing that.
[02:46:43.902 --> 02:46:47.543]  Speaking of videos, I've done 2 hours and 46 minutes and haven't plugged them yet.
[02:46:48.383 --> 02:46:50.684]  We have America Freedom to Fascism in stock.
[02:46:51.244 --> 02:46:55.085]  When you get it for $19.95, you can get Terror Storm for $9.95.
[02:46:55.665 --> 02:47:02.127]  Even if you already have one of the films, take advantage of that discount and give one of them as a gift, or show it to your friends and family.
[02:47:02.737 --> 02:47:12.663]  I mean, it comes down to you doing what you just said you were doing, uh, there, Skip, is you're out there and you've woken up a bunch of people and then some you can't wake up.
[02:47:13.263 --> 02:47:14.123]  That's okay!
[02:47:16.245 --> 02:47:18.526]  You know, not everybody is going to fight this thing with us.
[02:47:18.546 --> 02:47:22.248]  Not everybody has it... Most people don't even have the respect for themselves.
[02:47:22.768 --> 02:47:25.590]  They're insecure walking into a building, you know, and people looking at them.
[02:47:26.330 --> 02:47:28.432]  So they sure don't see themselves as a leader.
[02:47:30.376 --> 02:47:32.757]  Standing up against something scary.
[02:47:34.277 --> 02:47:35.778]  You know, most men are cowards.
[02:47:36.758 --> 02:47:39.579]  That's why they take on the facsimiles of bravery.
[02:47:39.899 --> 02:47:46.380]  The sports cap, the sports shirt, the sticking the chest out, the bulging of the eyes, the swaggering.
[02:47:47.721 --> 02:47:49.401]  That's not courage, men.
[02:47:50.382 --> 02:47:52.702]  That is an imitation of it.
[02:47:54.143 --> 02:47:55.523]  And you need to understand that.
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:47:59.002]  And most women don't know what it is to be a woman.
[02:47:59.062 --> 02:48:03.624]  It's to be a provider, a lover, a helper, a creator.
[02:48:04.285 --> 02:48:05.786]  Not someone tarting about.
[02:48:06.706 --> 02:48:11.629]  As much as I like the way women tarting about look, it's still not good for society.
[02:48:12.510 --> 02:48:21.675]  The point is that you can't go into a game not intending to win.
[02:48:21.995 --> 02:48:23.917]  And I'm telling you folks, we can win this.
[02:48:25.228 --> 02:48:28.410]  We're faster, we outweigh the enemy, we're smarter, we're quicker.
[02:48:28.610 --> 02:48:29.611]  You just got to realize it.
[02:48:29.651 --> 02:48:31.091]  I mean, they're scared to death right now.
[02:48:31.151 --> 02:48:36.354]  They realize the sleeping giant is starting to wake up and we're going to take them down.
[02:48:38.376 --> 02:48:42.838]  The alternative is total slavery and dehumanization, a Matrix-like Brave New World.
[02:48:42.898 --> 02:48:43.819]  I'm not going to be part of that.
[02:48:44.179 --> 02:48:50.423]  Speaking of my videos, all of my films in super high bandwidth down to low bandwidth are on PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:49:52.625 --> 02:49:53.125]  Use it again.
[02:49:53.505 --> 02:49:55.367]  It's an incredible activist tool.
[02:49:55.967 --> 02:49:59.989]  All 15 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports.
[02:50:00.029 --> 02:50:04.812]  We put up three reports in the last week, specially produced reports.
[02:50:04.832 --> 02:50:07.314]  We've got two more coming up.
[02:50:07.414 --> 02:50:10.896]  One about occult symbolism in England and in Texas and other areas.
[02:50:11.497 --> 02:50:13.358]  A big black pentagram they've got out at the
[02:50:14.088 --> 02:50:14.948]  Texas Capitol.
[02:50:15.408 --> 02:50:16.248]  We go into that.
[02:50:16.769 --> 02:50:20.609]  Another big report that's coming out.
[02:50:20.649 --> 02:50:25.490]  I mean, just a bunch of amazing stuff on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:50:26.010 --> 02:50:30.091]  And your membership makes what we do possible.
[02:50:30.151 --> 02:50:31.691]  So this is a call for support.
[02:50:32.492 --> 02:50:36.972]  And I'd rather plug it once a day and then have you really support it than just sit here and beat you over the head with it.
[02:50:37.473 --> 02:50:39.493]  If you believe in what we're doing, you need to support us.
[02:50:41.159 --> 02:50:46.143]  And because I don't want to be associated with the scallywags and the shysters and the rest of them.
[02:50:46.544 --> 02:50:48.065]  I don't sit here and ask for donations.
[02:50:49.106 --> 02:50:53.649]  You know, and sit here and plead and scrabble around and do all of that.
[02:50:54.390 --> 02:50:57.072]  We just ask you to support us because we think we're doing good work.
[02:50:57.112 --> 02:50:58.073]  We've made some good films.
[02:50:58.313 --> 02:50:59.874]  We carry other good books and videos.
[02:51:00.114 --> 02:51:01.796]  So you're not just supporting us, you're supporting them.
[02:51:03.301 --> 02:51:04.402]  Uh, we're here.
[02:51:04.882 --> 02:51:05.943]  Support our materials.
[02:51:06.443 --> 02:51:09.745]  You can go up to PrisonPlanet.tv and burn everything we've done to disk.
[02:51:10.346 --> 02:51:12.507]  It is an insanely good activist tool.
[02:51:13.027 --> 02:51:17.310]  It is an armory to arm you to go out and smash the enemy.
[02:51:17.910 --> 02:51:18.711]  They're scared.
[02:51:19.551 --> 02:51:21.092]  They're telling you you don't have power.
[02:51:22.013 --> 02:51:24.294]  Ha ha ha, make copies of videos, ha ha ha.
[02:51:24.334 --> 02:51:25.575]  They're doing that hoping you'll quit.
[02:51:26.055 --> 02:51:28.057]  Aggressively make copies.
[02:51:28.197 --> 02:51:30.238]  Aggressively savage the enemy.
[02:51:33.715 --> 02:51:39.144]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:39.545 --> 02:51:47.198]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:47.856 --> 02:51:54.898]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:55.319 --> 02:52:06.722]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:07.043 --> 02:52:10.584]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:11.024 --> 02:52:12.965]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:13.265 --> 02:52:17.126]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:54:14.645 --> 02:54:19.588]  Government wants excuses to get you in their system to then make you a slave and feed off your labor.
[02:54:19.608 --> 02:54:21.929]  That's why they want to get you in the system.
[02:54:43.789 --> 02:54:50.850]  And AP reports that in Bangor, City Council approved a measure Monday to prohibit people from smoking in vehicles when children are present.
[02:54:51.291 --> 02:54:54.571]  Which sounds all reasonable, but it's a new way to get you in their clutches.
[02:54:55.311 --> 02:54:56.872]  Or I thought I saw you smoking.
[02:54:56.892 --> 02:54:58.532]  It never ends with these people.
[02:55:00.652 --> 02:55:01.393]  A U.S.
[02:55:01.733 --> 02:55:03.853]  sub collides with a Japanese ship.
[02:55:03.873 --> 02:55:05.253]  That's really not that important.
[02:55:05.273 --> 02:55:08.094]  I don't know why I'm even...
[02:55:08.863 --> 02:55:09.683]  Covering that.
[02:55:09.743 --> 02:55:13.044]  It reports that the average illegal alien has been arrested six times.
[02:55:13.544 --> 02:55:15.904]  They just re-released some, but not with citizens.
[02:55:16.444 --> 02:55:22.646]  Again, these are all incentives to get them here and to keep them here.
[02:55:24.146 --> 02:55:33.888]  Continuing here, UPI as well as the Austin American Statesman reported that a watchdog group
[02:55:35.163 --> 02:55:42.328]  Charges a nuclear warhead nearly exploded in Texas when it was being dismantled at the government's Pantex facility near Amarillo.
[02:55:42.808 --> 02:55:55.076]  The project on government oversight says it has been told by knowledgeable experts that the warhead nearly detonated in 2005 because, we just learned about this, of an unsafe amount of pressure was applied while it was being dismantled.
[02:55:55.496 --> 02:55:57.237]  The Austin American Station reports the U.S.
[02:55:57.257 --> 02:56:00.099]  Department of Energy fined the plant's operator $110,000 last month.
[02:56:02.518 --> 02:56:11.049]  An investigator for Project on Government Oversight says the weapon involved was a W56 warhead 100 times the destructive power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
[02:56:11.390 --> 02:56:12.772]  Of course, it was a plant full of these.
[02:56:14.207 --> 02:56:17.328]  Of course, the average people around here don't even know that stuff's everywhere.
[02:56:17.909 --> 02:56:19.889]  Like, there's two nuclear plants in Austin.
[02:56:20.290 --> 02:56:22.631]  You tell the average person, they go, what's a nuclear plant?
[02:56:22.811 --> 02:56:25.852]  But they know who Jack Bauer is, and the torturing children's good.
[02:56:26.512 --> 02:56:33.135]  The Watchdog Group says the problem was caused in part by technicians at the plant being required to work up to 72 hours each week.
[02:56:34.996 --> 02:56:43.199]  And they released an anonymous letter reportedly sent by Pentax employees warning that long hours and efforts to increase output were causing dangerous conditions at the plant.
[02:56:44.324 --> 02:56:46.125]  It's because they made 20,000 of the things.
[02:56:47.605 --> 02:56:48.645]  We're out of time.
[02:56:48.665 --> 02:56:50.166]  I want to take one call here.
[02:56:50.186 --> 02:56:54.287]  I think we have time to go to Flores in Oregon.
[02:56:54.307 --> 02:56:55.047]  You're on the air.
[02:56:55.107 --> 02:56:55.887]  Thank you for holding.
[02:56:55.927 --> 02:56:56.287]  Welcome.
[02:56:56.908 --> 02:56:58.928]  Thank you very much for letting me speak.
[02:56:59.548 --> 02:57:07.631]  I heard one of the most stunning announcements from Captain Joyce Riley, one of the head spokesmen for the Gulf War.
[02:57:07.671 --> 02:57:08.891]  Yeah, I know who she is.
[02:57:09.351 --> 02:57:10.691]  Well, this is stunning.
[02:57:11.632 --> 02:57:12.572]  According to her,
[02:57:13.277 --> 02:57:15.119]  The government and the U.S.
[02:57:15.199 --> 02:57:20.183]  Navy have started using cow's blood for transfusion.
[02:57:20.383 --> 02:57:24.527]  Oh yeah, that was in the news last year that they illegally are doing experiments.
[02:57:24.547 --> 02:57:27.789]  They test every experimental drug, blood, vaccines on them.
[02:57:27.889 --> 02:57:28.990]  They hate their guts.
[02:57:29.130 --> 02:57:30.452]  They want to kill the troops.
[02:57:32.013 --> 02:57:37.818]  They want to give this unannounced to little children and adults up to 70.
[02:57:37.938 --> 02:57:40.260]  Well that's right, they said test it on the American people too.
[02:57:41.061 --> 02:57:41.181]  Yeah.
[02:57:41.221 --> 02:57:43.823]  What's wrong with having them experiment on you?
[02:57:43.843 --> 02:57:44.363]  It's freedom!
[02:57:45.164 --> 02:57:45.484]  Yeah.
[02:57:45.544 --> 02:57:46.945]  You're not with Al-Qaeda, are you?
[02:57:49.106 --> 02:57:49.466]  No, I'm not.
[02:57:49.486 --> 02:57:52.668]  What's wrong with them irradiating our food and D.U.
[02:57:52.728 --> 02:57:57.971]  blowing all in the air and open borders and leprosy spreading everywhere and tuberculosis?
[02:57:58.331 --> 02:57:59.012]  It's nutritious.
[02:57:59.452 --> 02:58:00.193]  Mercury's good for you.
[02:58:00.213 --> 02:58:01.373]  This covers everyone.
[02:58:02.074 --> 02:58:02.414]  Pardon me?
[02:58:02.814 --> 02:58:04.175]  This covers everyone.
[02:58:04.255 --> 02:58:04.715]  Oh, I know.
[02:58:04.775 --> 02:58:05.196]  It's freedom.
[02:58:06.036 --> 02:58:07.377]  But hell, they're reading our mail now.
[02:58:07.964 --> 02:58:10.666]  Oh, I know, but they've been reading my mail for ten years.
[02:58:10.746 --> 02:58:11.127]  Freedom!
[02:58:11.167 --> 02:58:12.147]  And my email.
[02:58:12.228 --> 02:58:12.548]  Freedom!
[02:58:12.588 --> 02:58:14.069]  And they're tapping my phone.
[02:58:14.089 --> 02:58:14.429]  Freedom!
[02:58:15.190 --> 02:58:15.530]  I know.
[02:58:16.251 --> 02:58:23.497]  Well, anyway, you have that horrible announcement, and I know very well if Captain Joyce Riley would say it, she's got it documented.
[02:58:23.897 --> 02:58:26.619]  Well, no, it was in the front page of the newspapers about a month ago.
[02:58:26.639 --> 02:58:28.281]  He wouldn't care.
[02:58:28.681 --> 02:58:30.162]  I, honest to God, I don't know.
[02:58:30.602 --> 02:58:33.585]  Seven million Jews were afraid, and look where it got them.
[02:58:34.806 --> 02:58:37.368]  Yeah, well, we're out of time.
[02:58:38.420 --> 02:58:39.661]  I appreciate your call.
[02:58:39.801 --> 02:58:42.343]  I mean, you know, the government loves you, everybody.
[02:58:42.383 --> 02:58:43.124]  Just trust them.
[02:58:43.825 --> 02:58:44.885]  Don't listen to me.
[02:58:44.985 --> 02:58:46.126]  Everything's alright.
[02:58:46.166 --> 02:58:47.788]  There's gonna be amnesty soon.
[02:58:47.828 --> 02:58:48.949]  That'll fix everything.
[02:58:49.969 --> 02:58:53.172]  They're introducing the legislation again right now, and this time it's gonna pass.
[02:58:53.853 --> 02:58:56.515]  Hate crimes laws, banning free speech, everything.
[02:58:56.555 --> 02:58:57.335]  That's good.
[02:58:57.355 --> 02:58:59.297]  That's what America's about.
[02:59:00.158 --> 02:59:00.958]  That's what it's about.
[02:59:00.998 --> 02:59:04.061]  It's about checkpoints and cops in black masks ordering you around.
[02:59:04.321 --> 02:59:05.822]  That's why George Washington fought.
[02:59:06.403 --> 02:59:07.624]  God bless you all.
