[00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:06.232]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.893 --> 00:00:07.933]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:09.795]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.415 --> 00:00:11.255]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:12.896]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.557 --> 00:00:17.219]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.882]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:23.303]  Music
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.501]  We're good to go.
[00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:39.442]  I think?
[00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:06.425]  I think we're good to go.
[00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:53.532]  We've got new developments concerning the fact that evidence is emerging clearly showing that the two Border Patrol agents who were in prison while they await their appeal were targeted and were not given a fair trial by the U.S.
[00:01:53.592 --> 00:01:58.593]  attorney who wished to use them as political sacrificial lambs.
[00:02:00.894 --> 00:02:03.176]  So we'll be discussing that as well.
[00:02:03.196 --> 00:02:08.160]  We're working on getting Jerome Corsion briefly to update you with the latest developments there.
[00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:19.549]  I have a stack of news here that ties together showing an ongoing escalation with Iran.
[00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:20.169]  Listen to this.
[00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.473]  Troops authorized to kill Iranian operatives in Iraq.
[00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:54.300]  Now, they've always, quote, been authorized to engage anyone who is attacking them or preparing to attack them, and there have been top British generals and special forces colonels and even American officers saying, look, there's no Iranians coming across the eastern Iraqi frontier from western Iran, and that Iran is not trying to escalate a conflict in Iraq.
[00:02:55.214 --> 00:02:56.455]  I'm sure they're doing something.
[00:02:56.535 --> 00:02:57.976]  It would be hard to believe if they weren't.
[00:02:59.297 --> 00:03:06.422]  But now this is Bush's way of trying to transition the Iraq war into a conflict with Iran.
[00:03:06.462 --> 00:03:19.991]  And again, there are a whole stack of separate reports in other areas where the UN, the Congress, British leaders are preparing the ground for a military strike.
[00:03:21.423 --> 00:03:24.804]  Troops authorized to kill Iranian operatives in Iraq.
[00:03:25.244 --> 00:03:28.945]  Administration strategy stirs concern among some officials.
[00:03:32.627 --> 00:03:39.649]  Also, Iran attack again possible, says Cameron.
[00:03:40.578 --> 00:03:52.544]  A preemptive military strike against Iran involving British troops could be launched under a conservative government after David Cameron yesterday refused to rule out the use of force against Iran.
[00:03:52.564 --> 00:03:58.667]  I think I'll just cover this after the break because there's so much news concerning Iran.
[00:03:59.267 --> 00:04:04.730]  Also, I tried to dig it out this morning and for some reason I had a little bit of trouble, but I'm sure we'll find it.
[00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.331]  I've got a few of my people trying to pull it up.
[00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:09.272]  I know it was in the Associated Press article
[00:04:10.035 --> 00:04:12.217]  And several other major publications.
[00:04:12.797 --> 00:04:31.571]  From memory, it was a top Air Force general, what, about six months ago, that said that there's complaints by international bodies and the UN and others about our use of the new ray gun that burns people's skin when it's at a focus beam and just causes pain on a wide beam.
[00:04:32.552 --> 00:04:39.217]  So they said, we're going to go ahead and test it on the American people, and if we can legitimize its use here, then they can't complain over there.
[00:04:40.464 --> 00:04:43.045]  I'm going to find that article because I want to give you the details.
[00:04:43.886 --> 00:04:49.809]  But it's back in the news because they're approving its use, rolling it out, giving it to police departments.
[00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.970]  Here it is.
[00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.230]  U.S.
[00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.211]  military unveils heat ray gun.
[00:04:54.111 --> 00:04:55.372]  Safety fears as U.S.
[00:04:55.412 --> 00:04:59.314]  demonstrates crowd control heat ray weapon.
[00:04:59.454 --> 00:05:00.315]  We'll cover that too.
[00:05:04.392 --> 00:05:07.534]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.895 --> 00:05:09.836]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.196 --> 00:05:17.861]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.542 --> 00:05:25.587]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.987 --> 00:05:28.929]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.631]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:32.071 --> 00:05:32.892]  NSA spies.
[00:05:33.448 --> 00:05:34.728]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:34.788 --> 00:05:36.769]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:01.970]  We're good to go.
[00:06:22.247 --> 00:06:22.807]  We're good to go.
[00:06:22.847 --> 00:06:23.728]  We're good to go.
[00:06:23.788 --> 00:06:24.728]  We're good to go.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.482]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:57.804 --> 00:06:59.325]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:07:00.926 --> 00:07:03.287]  Attention, attention everyone!
[00:07:03.307 --> 00:07:05.868]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:07:05.928 --> 00:07:10.631]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[00:07:11.292 --> 00:07:18.116]  Wrist Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse, or adding machine.
[00:07:18.656 --> 00:07:31.523]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wrist Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[00:07:31.983 --> 00:07:35.965]  Wrist Ease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[00:07:36.426 --> 00:07:40.408]  Wrist Ease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and...
[00:07:40.968 --> 00:07:46.493]  WristEase provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[00:07:46.874 --> 00:07:49.896]  You can order WristEase now at WristEase.com.
[00:07:50.277 --> 00:07:56.903]  That's WristEase, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, WristEase.com.
[00:07:57.063 --> 00:07:59.805]  Once again, WristEase.com.
[00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:07.212]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:26.935]  Dr. Jerome Corsi with the latest developments in his and others' investigation into the case of the two Border Patrol agents who clearly have been framed and set up as part of setting a precedent so that the Border Patrol agents will not be able to do their jobs.
[00:08:27.416 --> 00:08:29.196]  All part of the open border strategy.
[00:08:29.216 --> 00:08:30.396]  We'll be breaking that down.
[00:08:31.036 --> 00:08:39.979]  Then we've got Scott Ritter coming on as well as Darja Mall to break down what's really happening in the Middle East as the storm clouds gather and darken
[00:08:40.792 --> 00:08:47.557]  And begin to get quite violent concerning that upcoming war that we're desperately trying to avert.
[00:08:48.858 --> 00:08:54.403]  Military chief says test weapons on Americans before using them on enemies.
[00:08:56.104 --> 00:08:59.907]  And this was picked up by the Associated Press.
[00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:03.730]  This came out in October of last year.
[00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:09.174]  During the last segment, I was mentioning that I couldn't remember exactly...
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:22.009]  When this had been reported, and I was having trouble finding the article, because the Ray Gun weapon is back in the news, in the BBC, the Associated Press, London Guardian, and Newsweek Magazine.
[00:09:22.049 --> 00:09:24.711]  I have them all here in front of me.
[00:09:25.652 --> 00:09:27.313]  And I was indeed correct.
[00:09:27.353 --> 00:09:29.054]  My memory did serve me.
[00:09:29.515 --> 00:09:32.057]  But it was the Secretary of the Air Force.
[00:09:33.077 --> 00:09:34.999]  And the Secretary of the Air Force...
[00:09:36.308 --> 00:09:56.033]  said, and it's got his quotes here, that we should use this weapon on the American people first and then they could claim under international law that it was simply a law enforcement tool and that it didn't, I mean, because this thing even violates the laws of war.
[00:09:57.854 --> 00:10:00.254]  This violates the Geneva Convention.
[00:10:00.774 --> 00:10:03.595]  This violates, this is designed
[00:10:04.588 --> 00:10:11.911]  Coast to coast, every major city has gotten mobile units with eardrum-busting sound cannons.
[00:10:12.892 --> 00:10:14.992]  We showed you that in New York for the RNC in 2004.
[00:10:15.433 --> 00:10:21.295]  And they put over 2,000 citizens in a FEMA camp run by Bechtel and George Schultz.
[00:10:23.916 --> 00:10:25.417]  Well, forget the sound cannons.
[00:10:25.457 --> 00:10:27.818]  They're nothing compared to these microwave guns.
[00:10:27.878 --> 00:10:30.699]  They can focus them in to where it actually burns your skin.
[00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:32.840]  It's a microwave weapon.
[00:10:33.619 --> 00:10:45.002]  Or they can put it on wide-spectrum burst, and simply it creates the feeling of what's been described as when you touch a light bulb, but that's all over your body.
[00:10:45.482 --> 00:10:46.782]  Just a burning heat.
[00:10:49.643 --> 00:10:51.163]  Here it is from the BBC.
[00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:51.543]  U.S.
[00:10:51.563 --> 00:10:54.204]  military unveils heat ray gun.
[00:10:54.324 --> 00:10:55.284]  They didn't unveil this.
[00:10:55.424 --> 00:11:02.266]  We've been reporting on it for four years since they began deploying these covertly to police departments.
[00:11:02.972 --> 00:11:03.312]  The U.S.
[00:11:03.352 --> 00:11:14.575]  military has given the first public display of what it says is a revolutionary heat-ray weapon to repel enemies or disperse hostile crowds.
[00:11:16.055 --> 00:11:24.797]  Called the Active Denial System, it projects an invisible high-energy beam that proceeds and produces a sudden burning feeling.
[00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:32.952]  Military officials who say the gun is harmless believe it could be used as a non-lethal way of making enemies surrender their weapons.
[00:11:34.853 --> 00:11:37.994]  Because it shoots through and around obstacles.
[00:11:39.214 --> 00:11:40.194]  And it continues.
[00:11:40.695 --> 00:11:45.436]  Officials said there were wide-ranging military interest in the technology.
[00:11:45.876 --> 00:11:49.277]  This is a breakthrough technology that's going to give our forces capability.
[00:11:49.617 --> 00:11:55.019]  They don't now have, defense official Theodore Barana told Reuters news agency.
[00:11:56.059 --> 00:11:57.780]  A blast from an oven.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.300]  The prototype weapon.
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:04.542]  Notice, once we're already in the North American Union officially, they tell you it might be coming.
[00:12:04.742 --> 00:12:06.442]  Okay, the old timers were right.
[00:12:06.762 --> 00:12:09.903]  There is a plan for North American Union, and then we're actually already in it.
[00:12:10.344 --> 00:12:11.784]  But people are just now hearing about it.
[00:12:11.804 --> 00:12:12.644]  It might be coming.
[00:12:13.185 --> 00:12:14.465]  Oh, it's a prototype!
[00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:20.767]  We're talking Detroit, New York, L.A., Dallas.
[00:12:20.807 --> 00:12:22.708]  They've got these things in warehouses.
[00:12:22.728 --> 00:12:23.788]  They've got units trained.
[00:12:24.916 --> 00:12:29.279]  It's the same thing with, well, I mean, there's so many examples of this.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.202]  Oh, you know, Boston Globe headline, they may start recruiting foreigners.
[00:12:34.863 --> 00:12:44.028]  First paragraph, it says, well, they've already been doing it for the last five years, but now they may intensify it and open even more recruiting stations in Manila and Mexico City.
[00:12:45.449 --> 00:12:46.550]  It's always the same M.O.
[00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.351]  It's propaganda.
[00:12:47.391 --> 00:12:48.031]  Propaganda.
[00:12:50.367 --> 00:12:54.690]  The prototype weapon was demonstrated at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia.
[00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.513]  A beam was fired from a large rectangular dish mounted on a Humvee vehicle.
[00:12:59.233 --> 00:13:04.957]  The beam reached up to 500 meters or 550 yards, much farther than existing non-lethal weapons like rubber bullets.
[00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:10.781]  It can penetrate clothes, suddenly heating up the skin of anyone in its path to 50 Celsius.
[00:13:11.601 --> 00:13:13.503]  That fries your skin, boys and girls.
[00:13:14.503 --> 00:13:16.104]  50 Celsius.
[00:13:16.204 --> 00:13:17.825]  That is really hot.
[00:13:17.845 --> 00:13:18.626]  That's stovetop.
[00:13:19.449 --> 00:13:20.210]  We're good to go.
[00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.370]  I think?
[00:13:41.796 --> 00:13:50.062]  A Reuters journalist who volunteered to be shot with a beam described the sensation as similar to a blast from a very hot oven, too painful to bear without diving for cover.
[00:13:50.582 --> 00:13:51.363]  Crowd control.
[00:13:51.903 --> 00:13:53.084]  And it just goes into all that.
[00:13:53.304 --> 00:13:53.844]  Here's another one.
[00:13:53.904 --> 00:13:55.005]  Safety fears as U.S.
[00:13:55.045 --> 00:13:57.487]  demonstrates crowd control heat ray weapon.
[00:13:58.167 --> 00:14:05.352]  And the experts that are criticizing it say that if it hits the eye, it could cause serious, your eye is very delicate, mucous membrane problems.
[00:14:06.464 --> 00:14:07.044]  We're good to go.
[00:14:07.064 --> 00:14:07.264]  I think?
[00:14:36.891 --> 00:14:38.592]  And then I did get one of the articles.
[00:14:38.612 --> 00:14:40.392]  This is an article about the AP article.
[00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:42.293]  We're still trying to find the AP article from October.
[00:14:42.713 --> 00:14:45.993]  Military chief says test weapons on Americans before using them on enemies.
[00:14:47.834 --> 00:14:48.734]  And it goes on.
[00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:51.035]  Let me find his name.
[00:14:51.435 --> 00:15:03.438]  Secretary Wayne told a reporter at the Houston Chronicle in September that a non-lethal weapon, such as high-powered microwave devices, should be used on American citizens in crowd control situations before they are used on a battlefield.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.583]  Just that bit should drive most Americans to put pen to paper writing letters for Wayne's removal.
[00:15:10.864 --> 00:15:11.864]  Hey, let me tell you something.
[00:15:12.104 --> 00:15:13.925]  And I think you should still write letters and make calls.
[00:15:14.225 --> 00:15:22.310]  But when you do, Congress just hires more federal funds for paramilitary forces, more microwave guns, more riot troops, more FEMA camps.
[00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.331]  Oh, they've gotten the message.
[00:15:25.385 --> 00:15:28.586]  They know 97% don't want toll roads on existing roads.
[00:15:28.946 --> 00:15:31.547]  They know 99% don't want a North American union.
[00:15:31.987 --> 00:15:37.388]  They know 95% don't want these electronic no-record voting machines.
[00:15:37.448 --> 00:15:40.629]  They know 91% in Gallup polls don't want open borders.
[00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:48.031]  And they know they work for foreign banks, and so they know you're going to revolt, and so they're deploying the microwave guns.
[00:15:48.491 --> 00:15:54.553]  And the only reason they're now announcing this like it's some brand new thing is because they've got to get you ready for it to accept it
[00:15:55.146 --> 00:16:05.969]  So when they take your pensions and blow out the economy and plunge the dollar down to nothing, so when you are out there freaking out in the streets, they can have their dumbed-down goons come out and microwave gun you in the street.
[00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:14.211]  And by the way, the reports I've got are they've got hand-held microwave guns that will kill you.
[00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:17.792]  And I can't say any more about that because it's classified sources.
[00:16:19.472 --> 00:16:23.193]  Okay, they've got sound guns that will bust your organs right open.
[00:16:23.971 --> 00:16:29.732]  Okay, they've got stuff that you can wave across a crowd that's handheld that will kill you.
[00:16:30.433 --> 00:16:32.673]  They've got handheld microwave guns.
[00:16:32.933 --> 00:16:39.535]  They've got handheld particle beams that will hit you and you will burst open like a tomato thrown against a wall.
[00:16:40.855 --> 00:16:43.196]  Now, Jane's Weapons Quarterly reports on some of this.
[00:16:43.576 --> 00:16:47.377]  I've got Marines on tape and Urban Warrior slipping up and talking about it.
[00:16:49.356 --> 00:16:51.057]  We first reported on it seven years ago.
[00:16:51.097 --> 00:16:54.278]  Now it's even been in a few papers that they do have combat mechs.
[00:16:54.298 --> 00:16:56.218]  It was in the Honolulu Advertiser.
[00:16:56.258 --> 00:16:57.138]  It's been in a few others.
[00:16:58.619 --> 00:17:01.560]  Basically, an Osprey or a helicopter lands.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:10.422]  It drops off a few of these, and it looks like a... It's about the size of a Suburban, but it's got treads, and it's got weapons.
[00:17:10.922 --> 00:17:13.123]  It's got non-lethal gas, lethal gas.
[00:17:13.423 --> 00:17:15.583]  They're made to drive up and ram into your house.
[00:17:15.843 --> 00:17:18.184]  Then they've got big hoses that have got little wheels
[00:17:19.536 --> 00:17:20.378]  360 around the hose.
[00:17:20.398 --> 00:17:21.622]  That way the little wheels...
[00:17:24.031 --> 00:17:27.193]  You know, if it turns over as it comes in, it sends out tentacles, folks.
[00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:35.997]  It just rolls over, and it's got wheels on every side spinning, and that thing just rushes into your house with a camera on it, and that operator in there hits the nerve gas.
[00:17:37.117 --> 00:17:38.458]  Everybody's dead inside.
[00:17:38.518 --> 00:17:40.699]  Okay, that's what they've got ready for us.
[00:17:40.999 --> 00:17:42.820]  This is what the scum has done.
[00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:50.224]  By 2011, half of the Air Force's fighter fleet will be robotic and controlled.
[00:17:50.814 --> 00:17:54.136]  By technicians thousands or hundreds of miles away.
[00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:56.338]  Okay?
[00:17:56.538 --> 00:18:00.821]  And this allows small criminal elites to run more remote control attacks like 9-11.
[00:18:01.601 --> 00:18:04.503]  It allows them to do things that the troops wouldn't follow the orders.
[00:18:04.824 --> 00:18:09.767]  Plus, they're going to have large contingents and already do of our mainline military force that are foreigner.
[00:18:10.027 --> 00:18:15.391]  They will be led by loyal black operators and others that have been trained to accept this.
[00:18:15.851 --> 00:18:16.611]  We're in trouble.
[00:18:16.692 --> 00:18:17.352]  And I'm telling you.
[00:18:18.012 --> 00:18:30.022]  We're going to face remote control tanks, remote control robots, we're going to face remote control microwave guns, we're going to face foreign troops led by traitor U.S.
[00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:30.342]  troops.
[00:18:31.803 --> 00:18:34.125]  Now, everything else we've told you that's coming has come.
[00:18:34.465 --> 00:18:39.910]  And I'm telling you, folks, I'm telling you, they're not playing games.
[00:18:43.433 --> 00:18:45.454]  And I, for one, just don't even know what to say about it anymore.
[00:18:45.494 --> 00:18:51.758]  I mean, look at the Secretary of the Air Force saying we need to use this on the American people.
[00:18:52.198 --> 00:18:55.640]  It was in the Houston Chronicle, AP, a bunch of other places.
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.021]  And you go read his quotes for yourself.
[00:18:57.681 --> 00:18:58.922]  That's how pathetic we are.
[00:19:01.463 --> 00:19:02.584]  I don't even know what to say anymore.
[00:19:03.248 --> 00:19:10.674]  Paul Watson's got a really detailed report proving that Ahmed Dinejad never said wipe Israel off the map and that it's a hoax.
[00:19:11.194 --> 00:19:14.476]  You should go get this story just like babies out of incubators is a hoax.
[00:19:15.937 --> 00:19:17.078]  WMDs are a hoax.
[00:19:17.859 --> 00:19:18.960]  It's all a hoax.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.261]  It's all lies.
[00:19:21.962 --> 00:19:23.663]  Here's another one out of BBC.
[00:19:23.743 --> 00:19:25.184]  Choppers go cheap in U.S.
[00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:25.925]  Army sale.
[00:19:26.625 --> 00:19:27.966]  Now U.S.
[00:19:29.147 --> 00:19:32.390]  sheriffs and police departments are getting attack cobras.
[00:19:33.986 --> 00:19:39.148]  Oh, yeah, it's not enough to have Hueys and armored vehicles and tanks.
[00:19:40.788 --> 00:19:41.408]  Cobras.
[00:19:42.609 --> 00:19:43.849]  Local sheriffs from the U.S.
[00:19:43.869 --> 00:19:49.951]  seeking a few armored fighting vehicles or a couple of attack helicopters are turning to the Army and the military for a bargain.
[00:19:51.792 --> 00:19:53.392]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:53.412 --> 00:19:58.154]  They're gearing up, and the cops, when they do this, are destroying their own country.
[00:19:58.354 --> 00:19:59.174]  Oh, my gosh.
[00:20:01.775 --> 00:20:03.617]  Dad, can we stop?
[00:20:03.937 --> 00:20:05.478]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[00:20:05.878 --> 00:20:06.139]  What?
[00:20:06.499 --> 00:20:06.839]  Again?
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.901]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[00:20:08.961 --> 00:20:13.405]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[00:20:13.625 --> 00:20:14.926]  Why did you do that?
[00:20:15.126 --> 00:20:20.931]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[00:20:21.231 --> 00:20:22.252]  Are we there yet?
[00:20:22.352 --> 00:20:23.433]  for the entire trip.
[00:20:23.673 --> 00:20:25.875]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[00:20:26.356 --> 00:20:27.357]  Great idea.
[00:20:27.377 --> 00:20:30.219]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[00:20:30.586 --> 00:20:37.660]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle, and using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[00:20:37.941 --> 00:20:38.242]  Honey?
[00:20:39.062 --> 00:20:40.303]  You're terrific!
[00:20:40.683 --> 00:20:42.183]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[00:20:42.303 --> 00:20:45.705]  You're the one that bought the family our sport Berkey water bottles.
[00:20:45.985 --> 00:20:46.765]  Now, can we stop?
[00:20:47.286 --> 00:20:48.006]  I need to go, too.
[00:20:48.306 --> 00:20:52.748]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:52.808 --> 00:20:53.108]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:20:54.769 --> 00:20:56.149]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:05.094 --> 00:21:08.736]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:21:09.376 --> 00:21:13.258]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:21:13.938 --> 00:21:22.543]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:21:23.503 --> 00:21:30.667]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[00:21:31.596 --> 00:21:39.719]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:43.320]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.140]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:44.320]  Call now.
[00:21:44.341 --> 00:21:48.202]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:22:03.951 --> 00:22:04.432]  We're good to go.
[00:22:19.734 --> 00:22:33.041]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule in 1645 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:33.541 --> 00:22:38.864]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:22:39.144 --> 00:22:44.967]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:22:45.367 --> 00:22:45.427]  1-800-686-2237
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.481]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:07.141 --> 00:23:16.045]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:16.505 --> 00:23:23.688]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:24.415 --> 00:23:28.278]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with Lace-Med Inc.'
[00:23:28.258 --> 00:23:29.899]  's patented methodology.
[00:23:30.399 --> 00:23:41.227]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:41.988 --> 00:23:44.049]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:45.971]  For more information, call 702-953-0222.
[00:23:49.093 --> 00:23:53.437]  We don't need no education We don't need no thought control
[00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:29.490]  Drum course is coming up.
[00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.011]  I know we've got your calls lined up.
[00:24:31.031 --> 00:24:32.052]  We'll get to you as well.
[00:24:32.072 --> 00:24:37.257]  We want to talk about the case of the two Border Patrol agents framed.
[00:24:37.297 --> 00:24:39.279]  The evidence is now becoming extremely clear.
[00:24:39.299 --> 00:24:43.583]  95% chance we've got to continue to do our research.
[00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:47.522]  And then of course we're going to be covering Iran, target Iran.
[00:24:47.562 --> 00:24:49.563]  They're geared up big time in the second and third hour.
[00:24:49.583 --> 00:24:51.264]  We're going to do a detailed report on this.
[00:24:51.744 --> 00:24:58.307]  I have six mainstream news articles covering different angles as they gear the public up and get the public conditioned to accept this.
[00:24:59.808 --> 00:25:09.152]  Meanwhile, helicopters, attack helicopters, armored vehicles, rocket launchers, they're now transferring these to police departments basically at the cost of shipping.
[00:25:10.553 --> 00:25:12.654]  The BBC reports all over the U.S.
[00:25:12.874 --> 00:25:13.815]  It's been going on for 15 years.
[00:25:16.659 --> 00:25:22.691]  But they won't let the National Guard have bullets for their M16s on the border as they're shot at and overrun.
[00:25:24.182 --> 00:25:39.710]  And if they won't let Border Patrol agents leave their station, and they're only allowed to look left or right, backwards or forwards, if they see illegals on their left and they're supposed to look to their right, this is an official policy for four years, they will be fired if they pursue.
[00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.992]  You're not allowed to see illegals running right past you.
[00:25:42.412 --> 00:25:49.876]  Their main job now is picking up trash in the scrub brush so that they're basically out there with the rattlesnakes not doing their real job.
[00:25:50.616 --> 00:25:51.977]  And now it turns out that the...
[00:26:09.565 --> 00:26:18.368]  Prosecutor in this from Homeland Security didn't allow a bunch of the evidence to come out and basically was acting as the judge sealing everything.
[00:26:18.748 --> 00:26:19.628]  Hey, cops!
[00:26:20.048 --> 00:26:20.988]  Hey, Border Patrol!
[00:26:21.068 --> 00:26:22.129]  Welcome to the club!
[00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.930]  All I've ever asked for is fair trials.
[00:26:27.771 --> 00:26:29.131]  Let people bring out the evidence.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:37.263]  And this is a system we face now where every week I see where they burn good cops across this country.
[00:26:37.743 --> 00:26:41.925]  They burn good police, good peace officers, good law enforcement officers.
[00:26:42.605 --> 00:26:44.106]  And the thugs get promoted.
[00:26:44.886 --> 00:26:47.807]  I've seen thugs here in Austin that beat up men in wheelchairs.
[00:26:48.168 --> 00:26:48.928]  Literally.
[00:26:49.428 --> 00:26:52.249]  People I know get promoted to supervisor.
[00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.090]  And up above that.
[00:26:54.831 --> 00:26:57.832]  And the good cops go absolutely nowhere.
[00:26:58.272 --> 00:27:00.073]  They want aggressive thugs.
[00:27:01.687 --> 00:27:10.774]  I've seen a good Marine Corps officer from Vietnam, good SWAT team commander, Travis County, when they weren't having botched raids, when they weren't having problems, Lieutenant Beck.
[00:27:11.555 --> 00:27:13.737]  And I was friends with him, and he was a good guy.
[00:27:13.777 --> 00:27:23.685]  And when Delta Force tried to come in and recruit him, he thought I was a kook a year before, and he called me in his office and said, here's their card, and I can't tell you all the stuff they said, but I can just tell you you're right, Alex.
[00:27:24.225 --> 00:27:24.626]  Boom.
[00:27:25.606 --> 00:27:26.147]  Fired.
[00:27:26.667 --> 00:27:29.970]  He's a security guy out at the airport now.
[00:27:32.721 --> 00:27:34.762]  You have to witness this in your life.
[00:27:34.822 --> 00:27:36.163]  You have to see this.
[00:27:37.203 --> 00:27:47.009]  You have to witness it happening to really be able to understand how real it is.
[00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:50.231]  There is good news.
[00:27:50.331 --> 00:27:53.313]  Maine is revolting against the digital national ID card.
[00:27:53.373 --> 00:27:54.553]  This is out of AP.
[00:27:55.374 --> 00:27:56.214]  They're shooting it now.
[00:27:56.254 --> 00:27:57.235]  We'll tell you about it later.
[00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.771]  Also, judge!
[00:28:00.192 --> 00:28:02.173]  Davenport red light cameras are illegal.
[00:28:02.233 --> 00:28:10.538]  We've had federal and state judges from San Diego to Indiana come out and say they're completely illegal.
[00:28:10.819 --> 00:28:12.440]  And we can go through why they're illegal.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.621]  It's a civil matter.
[00:28:14.681 --> 00:28:21.666]  You don't have an actual officer who witnessed it writing the ticket with the summons, with the due process.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:35.025]  You have red light cameras run by defense contractors or by their subsidiaries, Lockheed Martin and others, putting in this grid, and they just mail you a ticket, and it doesn't go through the proper constitutional process.
[00:28:35.845 --> 00:28:38.166]  Does that stop Austin, Texas from trying to implement it?
[00:28:38.526 --> 00:28:39.887]  Does that stop Houston, Texas?
[00:28:39.947 --> 00:28:41.007]  I'm just mentioning my state.
[00:28:41.448 --> 00:28:43.008]  Does that stop all these other places?
[00:28:43.108 --> 00:28:43.348]  No!
[00:28:44.369 --> 00:28:44.609]  No!
[00:28:45.809 --> 00:28:47.090]  It's like failure to ID.
[00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:49.991]  There have been hundreds of state cases, dozens of federal cases.
[00:28:50.351 --> 00:28:52.252]  There was a famous one in 86 here in Austin.
[00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:53.571]  We're good to go.
[00:29:05.738 --> 00:29:15.926]  A judge has ruled that Davenport's speed and red light cameras violate state law, a decision the city will likely appeal as plaintiff's attorneys seek repayment of thousands of fines issued by the system.
[00:29:16.286 --> 00:29:28.074]  The ruling was issued Tuesday by District Court Judge Gary McCarrick, who agreed with the plaintiff's argument that the city doesn't have the authority to adopt an ordinance that conflicts with state motor vehicle code.
[00:29:28.495 --> 00:29:34.279]  According to state law, people whose speed or red light must be issued criminal citations...
[00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:41.653]  Instead of a civil citation, the city of Davenport treats citations issued by cameras as civil matters.
[00:29:41.673 --> 00:29:42.813]  So I got that backwards earlier.
[00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:44.074]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:44.834 --> 00:29:46.335]  Jerome Corsi, stay with us.
[00:29:51.578 --> 00:29:52.458]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:54.579]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.261]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.562 --> 00:30:03.263]  Shelley, you're like a... Oh, wait.
[00:30:03.423 --> 00:30:04.444]  Why did you turn that down?
[00:30:04.923 --> 00:30:07.084]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[00:30:07.584 --> 00:30:10.426]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice.
[00:30:10.826 --> 00:30:12.067]  Well, what's the bed fan?
[00:30:12.247 --> 00:30:14.688]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[00:30:14.948 --> 00:30:16.129]  I can do something like that.
[00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:18.570]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.592]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[00:30:21.652 --> 00:30:23.453]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[00:30:23.573 --> 00:30:25.814]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[00:30:26.214 --> 00:30:26.834]  I guess you're right.
[00:30:27.214 --> 00:30:27.915]  Why don't we try it?
[00:30:28.075 --> 00:30:30.036]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[00:30:30.484 --> 00:30:34.876]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[00:30:35.157 --> 00:30:36.501]  I know where we can get some more information.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.262]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.

[00:31:37.265 --> 00:31:37.646]  We're good to go.
[00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:04.851]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:32:05.091 --> 00:32:07.133]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:32:07.293 --> 00:32:14.360]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:23.148]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:32:23.508 --> 00:32:28.190]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:32.372]  That's great news because Calbin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[00:32:32.572 --> 00:32:35.013]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[00:32:35.193 --> 00:32:39.535]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[00:32:42.936 --> 00:32:43.837]  You'll never use anything else.
[00:33:15.408 --> 00:33:19.170]  And he is sending an SOS to the world.
[00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:24.673]  He is Jerome Corsi, Dr. Jerome Corsi, Ph.D.,
[00:33:45.672 --> 00:33:53.863]  And he is absolutely on target on the North American Union, the Security and Prosperity Partnership, the Trans-Texas Corridors, the Napa Super Highways.
[00:33:53.963 --> 00:33:59.851]  He has dug up, he has done FOIA requests, he has been battling tirelessly...
[00:34:00.917 --> 00:34:16.309]  And we disagree a little bit on how to handle the Middle East and Iran, but I tell you, I really respect Dr. Corsi because he's taught me some things, and also he's been open on air and has been very courageous to admit that he now has serious questions about 9-11.
[00:34:18.045 --> 00:34:18.586]  We're good to go.
[00:34:18.606 --> 00:34:19.226]  We're good to go.
[00:34:40.303 --> 00:34:40.984]  We're good to go.
[00:35:03.055 --> 00:35:11.041]  He also writes for World Ent Daily, and he is a true boon to the work that we're doing in the battle for this republic.
[00:35:11.882 --> 00:35:27.635]  Now, I've been following this, and I've been studying this, and I've been watching this, and I've only talked about it a little bit on air because I was still doing research on it, and now it's emerged that what we thought at the beginning was in fact the case, and it follows the same M.O.,
[00:35:28.662 --> 00:35:41.256]  We've had people like Mr. Bach who ran INS, who was a former head of the Ford Foundation, openly saying he wants no borders, punishing Border Patrol agents, trying to have them arrested for doing their jobs.
[00:35:42.517 --> 00:35:44.840]  A big city cop can basically get away with murder
[00:35:45.718 --> 00:35:51.161]  But if you're a Border Patrol agent, you are micromanaged, you're paid almost nothing, you're treated like total garbage.
[00:35:51.681 --> 00:36:00.885]  When they started giving air marshals $24,000 pay increase, if they were Border Patrol agents and would leave, I knew something was going on after 9-11.
[00:36:00.945 --> 00:36:12.791]  When they just did all of these things, when they wouldn't let them, you know, they tell them you can look to the east or look to the west or look to the north or the south at their Border Patrol points.
[00:36:13.631 --> 00:36:21.938]  At these positions in their Broncos, if they see illegals to the east, when they were only allowed to look to the west, they're not allowed to even report seeing them.
[00:36:23.039 --> 00:36:27.422]  All of this is to stop them from doing their jobs.
[00:36:28.283 --> 00:36:41.213]  They're fired at routinely, they've been killed, FBI's been beaten, FBI's been shot, countless sheriff's deputies and others, homes being burned down, rocket attacks, kidnappings, car bombs.
[00:36:41.813 --> 00:36:43.094]  This is going on in Texas.
[00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:44.094]  We've interviewed the sheriffs.
[00:36:44.114 --> 00:36:48.836]  We've had Mexican troops come right up to them with guns three miles over the U.S.
[00:36:48.896 --> 00:36:51.657]  border and steal drugs that had been captured.
[00:36:51.677 --> 00:36:56.839]  And, of course, our troops got overrun a few weeks ago in Arizona.
[00:36:57.139 --> 00:37:05.202]  They ran because they weren't allowed to have bullets because the governor of Utah that had sent them down wouldn't allow them to have bullets.
[00:37:05.822 --> 00:37:07.142]  This is the reality.
[00:37:08.323 --> 00:37:08.463]  And...
[00:37:09.884 --> 00:37:10.925]  I think we're good to go.
[00:37:10.965 --> 00:37:11.806]  I think we're good to go.
[00:37:34.504 --> 00:37:35.044]  We're good to go.
[00:37:35.064 --> 00:37:35.264]  I think?
[00:37:53.318 --> 00:37:55.099]  We have 30 million illegals in this country.
[00:37:55.359 --> 00:37:57.281]  Dr. Corsi, thank you for coming on.
[00:37:57.361 --> 00:38:01.103]  I kind of wanted to build that up and give people a basic look of what's happening.
[00:38:01.123 --> 00:38:02.985]  Would you like to add anything to the big picture?
[00:38:03.245 --> 00:38:08.509]  And then let's get into your investigation of Agent Ramos and others.
[00:38:09.169 --> 00:38:12.992]  Well, first of all, Alex, it's a great pleasure and honor to be back with you, so thank you.
[00:38:14.013 --> 00:38:21.939]  I've been investigating Ramos and Compion, and these are the two Border Patrol agents in El Paso that are now in federal prison.
[00:38:22.964 --> 00:38:37.389]  And the supposed crime they committed, Alex, was that they fired their weapons at a fleeing drug smuggler who'd come across the border in El Paso in a van with 743 pounds of marijuana.
[00:38:37.409 --> 00:38:39.250]  That's a lot of marijuana.
[00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:40.830]  And U.S.
[00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:49.533]  Attorney Johnny Sutton in El Paso prosecuted these two border agents because they fired their weapons at the fleeing drug smuggler.
[00:38:50.194 --> 00:38:54.476]  Smuggler, who Johnny Sutton maintains was unarmed and trying to surrender.
[00:38:55.497 --> 00:38:59.939]  Then Johnny Sutton says they filed false reports and tried to cover up the crime scene.
[00:39:00.879 --> 00:39:10.324]  Well, Johnny Sutton went down to Mexico and got the drug smuggler, not to prosecute him, but to have him be the star witness.
[00:39:10.344 --> 00:39:11.825]  They gave him immunity.
[00:39:13.125 --> 00:39:14.586]  They brought him back across the border.
[00:39:14.606 --> 00:39:18.088]  He did get shot in his buttocks and the
[00:39:18.638 --> 00:39:19.599]  Johnny Sutton and the U.S.
[00:39:19.619 --> 00:39:23.660]  Attorney to the Department of Homeland Security got the bullet removed by a U.S.
[00:39:23.721 --> 00:39:25.521]  doctor and gave him free medical care.
[00:39:26.262 --> 00:39:42.770]  And now the drug dealer is set up to sue the Border Patrol for $5 million, claiming that his civil rights were violated and his major proof is going to be that these two Border Patrol agents who shot at him are in prison for criminally misusing their weapons.
[00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:45.791]  It's a completely remarkable story.
[00:39:45.851 --> 00:39:47.092]  It's totally upside down.
[00:39:47.697 --> 00:40:16.237]  And as I'm digging into it, Alex, I'm finding that Johnny Sutton may have been lying, that the evidence may not be what Johnny Sutton says it is, and there's a lot of increasing number of people here, including some very prominent congressmen that I wrote about yesterday and today on World Net Daily, Congressman Ted Poe of Texas and Congressman Michael McCaul, who are demanding that the DHS turn over to them investigative reports
[00:40:16.846 --> 00:40:22.165]  Which the DHS has been stonewalling for five months and it's a remarkable story
[00:40:23.079 --> 00:40:29.643]  And let's be clear, they've told the Republican caucus down in Texas that they have all these documents.
[00:40:29.943 --> 00:40:36.847]  They've told the media this, but they won't release their proof, and the prosecutor acted like the judge in the case, shielding a bunch of evidence.
[00:40:37.367 --> 00:40:41.569]  So they are definitely kind of like the cat caught with a canary in its mouth.
[00:40:41.789 --> 00:40:52.135]  Well, that's right, Alex, because there was a September 2006 meeting where DHS came on over to the Republican Texas delegation in Congress, and DHS represented...
[00:40:52.714 --> 00:41:01.359]  These two drug agents were doing things... I'm sorry, two Border Patrol agents, Ramos and Campion, were saying things like they wanted to go shoot some Mexicans.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:07.042]  They were fired on the drug smuggler knowing he was unarmed, that he wanted to surrender.
[00:41:07.843 --> 00:41:15.227]  And the congressman listened to that politely, and they said, fine, we'd like to see the investigative documents that prove those charges.
[00:41:16.128 --> 00:41:21.871]  And DHS promised in September 2006 to release the documents to Congress.
[00:41:22.438 --> 00:41:28.845]  Now as of yesterday, DHS was still refusing to turn these documents over.
[00:41:29.813 --> 00:41:31.313]  Now that's completely unacceptable.
[00:41:31.353 --> 00:41:32.894]  And that's because we know what we're going to find.
[00:41:32.914 --> 00:41:42.575]  They've slandered and lied and prejudiced the entire public in the media to demonize these men to ensure they don't get a proper appeal here.
[00:41:42.595 --> 00:41:45.096]  And by the way, they're in solitary confinement.
[00:41:45.596 --> 00:41:46.336]  And in chains.
[00:41:46.516 --> 00:41:49.156]  They're chained when they're brought out to meet with their wives.
[00:41:49.717 --> 00:41:51.917]  They're chained as if they were Charlie Manson.
[00:41:52.157 --> 00:41:54.697]  They're acting like they're supermax criminals.
[00:41:55.178 --> 00:41:57.818]  And I want to go to a couple of the evidentiary points here, Alex.
[00:41:58.447 --> 00:42:00.208]  That, you know, began to get me in this case.
[00:42:00.308 --> 00:42:07.771]  I interviewed Johnny Sutton for 35 minutes, and we printed word for word the interview on WorldNetDaily without any editorial comment.
[00:42:07.792 --> 00:42:09.612]  And I'm going to remind folks who Johnny Sutton is.
[00:42:09.672 --> 00:42:10.593]  Johnny Sutton is a U.S.
[00:42:10.633 --> 00:42:16.476]  attorney in El Paso who prosecuted these two Border Patrol agents, Ramos and Campion.
[00:42:17.296 --> 00:42:23.839]  Now, the first, the major charge here is that the fleeing drug suspect was unarmed.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.320]  Now, Alex...
[00:42:26.212 --> 00:42:30.536]  The drug suspect got across the border, and nobody apprehended him.
[00:42:31.317 --> 00:42:33.138]  Those borders are incredibly dangerous.
[00:42:33.259 --> 00:42:39.304]  I mean, literally 99.9% of the coyotes are armed, especially the drug smugglers.
[00:42:39.684 --> 00:42:43.388]  And then now, how is the evidence good if this guy then fled into Mexico?
[00:42:43.708 --> 00:42:45.790]  We don't even know if they really shot him.
[00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:49.053]  We don't know if this is a staged event, which the drug dealers have done before.
[00:42:49.293 --> 00:42:50.975]  Alex, let's just begin with a point of logic here.
[00:42:50.995 --> 00:42:51.875]  The point of logic is this.
[00:42:51.895 --> 00:42:54.718]  The drug dealer got to Mexico and was not apprehended.
[00:42:54.798 --> 00:42:57.881]  No one will ever know if he had a concealed weapon on him that day.
[00:42:57.961 --> 00:42:58.701]  It'll never be known.
[00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:20.563]  And no matter what Johnny Sutton says about him being unarmed, it can't be proved because he got away.
[00:43:20.723 --> 00:43:25.867]  Well, somebody shipping in that much drugs, it'd be hard to believe they didn't have a gun.
[00:43:26.147 --> 00:43:29.190]  Well, in fact, Agent Compion got in a struggle.
[00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:32.872]  This drug dealer was not just coming across the border.
[00:43:32.932 --> 00:43:42.139]  He drove a van with 743 pounds of marijuana in it across the point on the border that was known to be used by drug smugglers.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.021]  It was picked up by censors.
[00:43:44.645 --> 00:43:48.106]  About five Border Patrol agents in their cars start a pursuit.
[00:43:48.727 --> 00:43:55.629]  When the drug agent realizes he's being pursued, he turns his car around, his van around, and hightails it back to the border.
[00:43:56.269 --> 00:43:58.310]  He gets down on these dirt roads.
[00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:02.672]  The drug smuggler gets out of his van and runs for the Rio Grande.
[00:44:03.552 --> 00:44:10.675]  Now, these agents come up, about five agents on the scene, and Compion's the first to catch up with the drug dealer.
[00:44:10.695 --> 00:44:12.455]  There's this levee in a ditch down there.
[00:44:12.495 --> 00:44:13.776]  They're fighting down in the ditch.
[00:44:14.301 --> 00:44:15.822]  We're good to go.
[00:44:15.962 --> 00:44:17.603]  We're good to go.
[00:44:17.623 --> 00:44:18.164]  We're good to go.
[00:44:38.678 --> 00:44:40.719]  Well, you know, also, they were prosecuted.
[00:44:40.739 --> 00:44:43.560]  Johnny Sutton prosecuted these two border agents under the wrong statute.
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:44.561]  He prosecuted them under 18 U.S.C.
[00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:44.601]  924C.
[00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:07.571]  That particular provision in the U.S.
[00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:08.531]  Code... It's for U.S.
[00:45:08.591 --> 00:45:09.011]  citizens.
[00:45:09.331 --> 00:45:09.872]  No, no.
[00:45:09.992 --> 00:45:12.692]  It's for violent criminals.
[00:45:12.752 --> 00:45:23.456]  It's for drug traffickers and rapists who, in the process of committing their drug crime or their rape, also carry or use or discharge a weapon.
[00:45:24.596 --> 00:45:29.898]  You're not supposed to... So they were implying that they were involved in a crime to begin with.
[00:45:29.938 --> 00:45:31.278]  They're saying they're criminals.
[00:45:31.498 --> 00:45:32.018]  That's right.
[00:45:32.658 --> 00:45:34.379]  And it gave the jury the presumption to...
[00:45:35.018 --> 00:45:39.722]  Use that statute, which carries a 10-year maximum mandatory sentence.
[00:45:39.942 --> 00:45:40.983]  Mandatory 10-year.
[00:45:42.264 --> 00:45:46.768]  So what does Bush and Homeland Security and Michael Chertoff do?
[00:45:47.469 --> 00:45:53.134]  They are defending this and then prejudicing these men in the media, demonizing them.
[00:45:53.574 --> 00:45:58.598]  And the $64 million question is, Dr. Jerome Corsi, why are they doing that?
[00:45:58.658 --> 00:46:01.461]  And I know the answer because I heard you talk about it today when you were co-hosting.
[00:46:02.141 --> 00:46:13.904]  The Derry Brownfield Show, which is carried by the Genesis Network, is clearly to set a precedent to scare the rest of the Border Patrol, and you had a retired senior customs agent call in and say clearly that's what's happening.
[00:46:14.324 --> 00:46:15.325]  Well, that's exactly right.
[00:46:15.365 --> 00:46:22.866]  The message, and Congressman Poe said the same thing to me yesterday when I interviewed him, the message is to drug smugglers, you're not going to be shot at.
[00:46:23.287 --> 00:46:24.987]  The border is wide open, come across.
[00:46:25.707 --> 00:46:28.328]  And then it says to them, if you do get apprehended, run.
[00:46:29.312 --> 00:46:31.655]  Because nobody's going to bother you once you start running.
[00:46:32.036 --> 00:46:42.329]  It's a wide open border message, and every law enforcement officer up and down the line, every Border Patrol agent, ICE agent, deputy sheriffs, sheriffs, you name it,
[00:46:42.782 --> 00:46:46.344]  They all got the message.
[00:46:46.545 --> 00:46:50.727]  Why don't we lobby for a $24,000 base pay increase for the Border Patrol?
[00:46:50.767 --> 00:46:57.092]  Because that is a thousand times more vital to our national security and our sovereignty than more air marshals.
[00:46:57.132 --> 00:47:02.235]  I mean, why did they boost their money to hire away the Border Patrol?
[00:47:02.315 --> 00:47:03.716]  I mean, this is premeditated.
[00:47:03.996 --> 00:47:12.422]  Well, I agree with you, and I think with the Department of Homeland Security and the Attorney General stonewalling this, the next stories I'm going to be writing here
[00:47:13.538 --> 00:47:21.285]  I'm getting a hold of the ballistics evidence and documentation on it, and the ballistics did not check to the weapons these officers had.
[00:47:21.305 --> 00:47:24.208]  So who knows what this bullet was.
[00:47:24.328 --> 00:47:32.054]  Also, by the way, the bullet went into the left buttocks of the side of this drug smuggler, and it was lodged in his right groin.
[00:47:32.074 --> 00:47:37.479]  Now, Johnny Sutton, the prosecutor, is out there saying this drug smuggler was shot in the back.
[00:47:37.967 --> 00:47:38.547]  No, he wasn't.
[00:47:38.708 --> 00:47:42.190]  A, he was shot in the buttocks, and B, it was a lateral wound.
[00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:49.955]  He was shot in the side, which actually fits their after-action report, where they said he was turning in the dark with something towards them.
[00:47:50.175 --> 00:47:51.596]  Well, it was 1 o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:47:51.676 --> 00:47:55.659]  They said he turned toward them, crouched, and they saw something glisten in his hand.
[00:47:55.699 --> 00:47:56.680]  They thought it was a weapon.
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.442]  I thought in the report, though, he was like... They said he was in the shadows.
[00:47:59.782 --> 00:48:01.143]  Well, it might have been, but they saw him.
[00:48:01.303 --> 00:48:07.107]  And what the doctor said, the Army doctor who removed the bullet, said that this was consistent...
[00:48:07.637 --> 00:48:09.158]  And the supervisors knew about the shooting.
[00:48:37.026 --> 00:48:38.966]  All five officers knew about the shooting.
[00:48:39.367 --> 00:48:43.868]  Johnny Sutton said Compion, picking up his shell casings, was trying to cover up the shooting.
[00:48:44.168 --> 00:48:45.128]  That's ridiculous.
[00:48:45.648 --> 00:48:48.689]  You didn't need those shell casings to prove there had been shooting.
[00:48:48.709 --> 00:48:51.789]  You had about five agents down there who'd witnessed it in person.
[00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:52.890]  They all knew there was shooting.
[00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:54.730]  They told that to their supervisors.
[00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:57.451]  So it's a total frame-up right there.
[00:48:57.631 --> 00:48:58.951]  It's a total frame-up.
[00:48:59.251 --> 00:49:01.371]  And I'm holding the manual right here in my hand, U.S.
[00:49:01.691 --> 00:49:03.392]  Customs and Border Protection.
[00:49:03.412 --> 00:49:04.152]  The manual says...
[00:49:04.662 --> 00:49:12.126]  Failure to report the discharge of a firearm or the use of a weapon is required by the applicable firearms policy.
[00:49:12.186 --> 00:49:17.429]  And the penalty is a written reprimand or a maximum of five-day suspension.
[00:49:17.909 --> 00:49:20.471]  Well, that's a lot different than an 11- and 12-year prison sentence.
[00:49:21.511 --> 00:49:26.694]  And right now, solitary confinement brought to visit their wives and children in chains.
[00:49:27.154 --> 00:49:31.837]  And if that doesn't communicate to every single border agent, Border Patrol agent in the United States,
[00:49:32.301 --> 00:49:34.923]  That you're to leave your hands off of drug smugglers.
[00:49:35.563 --> 00:49:36.584]  I don't know what else does.
[00:49:36.624 --> 00:49:38.205]  The message is loud and clear.
[00:49:38.225 --> 00:49:41.026]  Well, now there's a move to get a congressional pardon.
[00:49:41.827 --> 00:49:46.750]  Yes, in fact, Congressman Duncan Hunter, I wrote about this earlier in the week in World Net Daily.
[00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:51.993]  Duncan Hunter, from California, has started a congressional pardon.
[00:49:52.093 --> 00:49:58.457]  Last I heard yesterday, he had 75 Republican congressmen sign as co-sponsors to that.
[00:49:58.957 --> 00:50:00.298]  They're pressing that forward.
[00:50:00.808 --> 00:50:15.711]  At the same time, the Texas Republican delegation, led by Michael McCaul and Congressman Ted Poe, now they've filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Department of Homeland Security to get those investigative reports, which is remarkable.
[00:50:16.231 --> 00:50:24.113]  Because on oversight responsibilities, DHS has no reason or authority to withhold those reports from Congress.
[00:50:24.453 --> 00:50:25.974]  And yet they're doing it, Alex.
[00:50:26.314 --> 00:50:27.434]  They're withholding reports.
[00:50:27.796 --> 00:50:29.377]  The Congress has a right to see.
[00:50:29.837 --> 00:50:33.198]  Congress has to file a Freedom of Information Act request to get them.
[00:50:33.498 --> 00:50:34.759]  I've never heard of that in my life.
[00:50:35.099 --> 00:50:37.680]  Dr. Corsi, I think this is the straw that broke the camel's back.
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:44.463]  This is showing all conservatives, all Republicans, that Bush is actively trying to destroy our border.
[00:50:45.163 --> 00:50:47.304]  I think it's the only conclusion you can come to, Alex.
[00:50:48.985 --> 00:50:49.945]  They know what they're doing.
[00:50:51.068 --> 00:50:51.668]  Unbelievable.
[00:50:51.748 --> 00:50:54.029]  Final segment with Dr. Jerome Corsi on the other side.
[00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:58.631]  I'm going to talk about what these ladies are saying, what these wives are saying of these agents.
[00:50:58.651 --> 00:51:07.815]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.156 --> 00:51:10.096]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.457 --> 00:51:18.080]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.792 --> 00:51:25.837]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.257 --> 00:51:37.664]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.984 --> 00:51:41.487]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.947 --> 00:51:43.848]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.208 --> 00:51:48.051]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:40.194 --> 00:53:40.815]  We're good to go.
[00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:10.591]  We basically don't have a border patrol.
[00:54:11.992 --> 00:54:19.257]  And the government and the media has been doing this dog and pony show where they arrest every two months or so around a thousand people.
[00:54:19.497 --> 00:54:21.238]  Last week it was 760-something.
[00:54:21.278 --> 00:54:23.099]  Before that, a few months ago, it was 1,100.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:31.104]  If you arrested a thousand a day, it'd be 365,000 in a year.
[00:54:32.304 --> 00:54:35.446]  It's about every two months they have one of these busts, so I guess it'd be about 6,000 a year.
[00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:40.091]  You've got 30 million illegals, 3 million more coming in a year.
[00:54:41.392 --> 00:54:43.033]  There is no Border Patrol, basically.
[00:54:43.073 --> 00:54:43.973]  It's all imploded.
[00:54:44.453 --> 00:54:45.954]  They're getting shot at routinely.
[00:54:46.014 --> 00:54:46.975]  It's a complete joke.
[00:54:48.015 --> 00:54:52.637]  And meanwhile, here's a World Net Daily story by Jerome Corsi, Dr. Corsi.
[00:54:52.977 --> 00:54:59.781]  Imprisoned agent's wife, president is a hypocrite, calls State of the Union speech total sellout of the United States of America to Mexico.
[00:55:00.081 --> 00:55:02.542]  You know, Bush says no amnesty, but then his plan is amnesty.
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:05.522]  Monica Ramos, the wife of one of the two U.S.
[00:55:05.542 --> 00:55:16.770]  Border Patrol agents in prison last week for wounding an escaping drug smuggler, attended the State of the Union speech in person last night and was sharply critical of President Bush, calling him a hypocrite and worse.
[00:55:17.291 --> 00:55:24.436]  Ramos' wife of Border Agent Ignacio Ramos attended the event as a guest of Representative Dana Rohrabacher.
[00:55:24.456 --> 00:55:32.462]  Ignacio Ramos and Jose Campion began prison sentences last week of 11 and 12 years respectively.
[00:55:33.095 --> 00:55:34.435]  Well, Alex, I interviewed Monica Ramos for that.
[00:55:34.455 --> 00:55:35.576]  I was talking to her all day.
[00:56:02.694 --> 00:56:08.176]  When they have the State of the Union, she got the ticket from Congressman Rohrabacher.
[00:56:08.236 --> 00:56:10.637]  She met with congressmen and senators all day long.
[00:56:11.457 --> 00:56:20.580]  She went to the State of the Union and watched George Bush basically give the lies about border security and wanted to catch drug smugglers.
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:22.280]  And she was devastated.
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:23.801]  I talked to her at the end of the evening.
[00:56:24.441 --> 00:56:27.702]  I was up until about 1 o'clock talking to her.
[00:56:27.742 --> 00:56:29.382]  She was a complete wreck.
[00:56:29.402 --> 00:56:30.983]  She could barely talk on the phone at all.
[00:56:31.801 --> 00:56:37.622]  Congressman Rohrabacher's office, the legislative aides there were kind of almost begging me not to interview her.
[00:56:37.662 --> 00:56:38.903]  I got the story out of her.
[00:56:39.423 --> 00:56:42.043]  I didn't get to bed myself until 2 o'clock in the morning.
[00:56:42.083 --> 00:56:42.864]  I was such a wreck.
[00:56:42.884 --> 00:57:01.068]  I mean, she was in tears sitting there looking at George Bush in the flesh knowing he was lying to the nation because her husband, who is a Border Patrol agent of a number of years, distinguished record, is in fact now sitting in federal prison because all he did was try to
[00:57:01.653 --> 00:57:12.038]  Stop a fleeing drug smuggler and shot at the smuggler after the smuggler had struggled with his partner and cut him and is running away to get to the border.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:18.461]  Agent Ramos should have been given a medal, not be in federal prison.
[00:57:18.701 --> 00:57:19.321]  Absolutely.
[00:57:19.361 --> 00:57:22.503]  They have got the toughest job in law enforcement.
[00:57:22.843 --> 00:57:24.724]  That's right, and this is completely upside down.
[00:57:25.144 --> 00:57:30.827]  If President Boyce thinks he's going to make any points with the American public by prosecuting and putting him in federal prison...
[00:57:31.297 --> 00:57:34.999]  Border Patrol agents who are trying to stop drug smugglers.
[00:57:35.739 --> 00:57:37.380]  I got some news from President Bush.
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:38.561]  That's not going down.
[00:57:38.981 --> 00:57:40.882]  That's just a lie and it's not going down.
[00:57:41.543 --> 00:57:42.683]  Monica Ramos was right.
[00:57:42.723 --> 00:57:44.164]  Bush is a hypocrite on the issue.
[00:57:45.645 --> 00:57:46.385]  Absolutely.
[00:57:46.666 --> 00:57:53.469]  And again, they thought they could just burn these agents, keep it quiet, let the word spread in the Border Patrol to shut down our security further.
[00:57:53.489 --> 00:57:57.552]  And Alex, lie about what the Border Patrol agents did.
[00:57:57.872 --> 00:58:00.093]  Because as I'm investigating the facts of this case,
[00:58:00.717 --> 00:58:02.679]  We find out he was not shot at the back.
[00:58:02.699 --> 00:58:05.402]  He was shot in the side of the buttocks.
[00:58:05.683 --> 00:58:11.269]  If and when you get those documents and we find out that this prosecutor was framing him, he needs to go to jail.
[00:58:11.309 --> 00:58:17.576]  That's a serious crime, just like the prosecutor in the case with the lacrosse players.
[00:58:17.736 --> 00:58:21.120]  Yeah, well, it's malicious prosecution, and that's what I'm on the trail to see if I can prove.
[00:58:22.119 --> 00:58:22.819]  And have you proved that?
[00:58:22.839 --> 00:58:25.060]  Are you going to call for indictments against this prosecutor?
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:25.060]  100%.
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:27.101]  You can guarantee it.
[00:58:27.141 --> 00:58:31.182]  I'll probably have an article over the weekend on WorldNetDaily or Human Events on that very subject.
[00:58:31.382 --> 00:58:36.624]  If this is the case, and it looks like it is, he's the one that needs to go to a prison in solitary confinement.
[00:58:36.964 --> 00:58:38.424]  Dr. Corsi, thanks for coming on.
[00:58:38.444 --> 00:58:39.745]  Alex, always an honor.
[00:58:39.785 --> 00:58:40.625]  Thank you very much.

[00:58:57.728 --> 00:58:58.368]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.048 --> 00:59:00.089]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.809 --> 00:59:01.969]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:03.390]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:05.031]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.051 --> 00:59:09.452]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.873 --> 00:59:13.994]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.715 --> 00:59:17.656]  We are now into hour number two.
[00:59:17.736 --> 00:59:22.017]  I'm jam-packing so much in, I'm even plugging my videos the last few days.
[00:59:22.238 --> 00:59:25.659]  Remember, we've got an online video on Boat Store at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:27.106 --> 00:59:31.469]  Later in this hour, coming up, is Scott Ritter talking about the build-up for war with Iran.
[00:59:31.529 --> 00:59:32.790]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:34.931]  James in Maryland and Greg and others.
[00:59:35.592 --> 00:59:36.473]  You're on the air, James.
[00:59:36.533 --> 00:59:36.853]  Welcome.
[00:59:39.515 --> 00:59:40.676]  He just dropped, okay?
[00:59:40.716 --> 00:59:41.616]  Greg in Ohio.
[00:59:41.636 --> 00:59:42.257]  You're on the air.
[00:59:42.317 --> 00:59:42.717]  Go ahead.
[00:59:42.737 --> 00:59:43.878]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:59:43.918 --> 00:59:44.278]  Good, sir.
[00:59:44.378 --> 00:59:45.219]  You're a great American.
[00:59:45.719 --> 00:59:47.561]  I try my best.
[00:59:47.661 --> 00:59:48.461]  I listen to you every day.
[00:59:48.481 --> 00:59:49.722]  I buy your videos.
[00:59:50.083 --> 00:59:54.866]  Let you know, I talked to Glenn Beck this morning, and I plugged your Bohemian Grove video.
[00:59:56.377 --> 01:00:00.318]  How you infiltrated that and your website, theinfowars.com.
[01:00:00.418 --> 01:00:02.138]  And he let that come out?
[01:00:02.238 --> 01:00:03.118]  He let it all come out.
[01:00:03.699 --> 01:00:07.039]  I talked about Resistance Manifesto with John Connor and trying to help him out.
[01:00:07.219 --> 01:00:07.919]  What did he say?
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.400]  He just went on about it.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:17.362]  He said that, you know, the grill has been talked about before, that there's a book out, I think it was called Them, he was talking about, and I'd never heard of it.
[01:00:17.822 --> 01:00:24.063]  Total whitewash, total... Listen, that book is written as satire...
[01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:35.411]  And in the book written by John Ronson, who did follow my infiltration for international television, here's an example.
[01:00:35.512 --> 01:00:39.037]  In the book, it has me cowering in fear of werewolves.
[01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:41.284]  Oh, wow.
[01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:01.724]  This place is crazy.
[01:01:01.784 --> 01:01:04.646]  This fog on the ground looks like something out of a werewolf movie.
[01:01:04.666 --> 01:01:05.707]  Remember the old movies?
[01:01:06.507 --> 01:01:10.711]  And that turned into me cowering in fear of werewolves in his book.
[01:01:11.311 --> 01:01:13.032]  So, see, that's how they operate.
[01:01:13.713 --> 01:01:14.473]  And, yeah.
[01:01:15.234 --> 01:01:25.702]  He let me plug in, and I was also going to ask you while I got you on the phone, is how much truth do you think there is to Kathy O'Brien's story, like her Transformation America book and her new one, I think, Access Denied?
[01:01:26.237 --> 01:01:27.538]  Have you ever interviewed her?
[01:01:27.778 --> 01:01:29.620]  I've interviewed them twice years ago.
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.001]  It's been about six, seven years.
[01:01:31.181 --> 01:01:32.222]  And let me just say this.
[01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:34.224]  I stick to what I can prove.
[01:01:34.965 --> 01:01:36.526]  I stick to what I know is real.
[01:01:36.706 --> 01:01:37.547]  And I just don't know.
[01:01:39.288 --> 01:01:40.850]  And so, you know, there you have it.
[01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:43.892]  You know, years ago, I just couldn't bring myself to believe it.
[01:01:43.932 --> 01:01:48.877]  But now with all the stuff that's come out and been admitted, it's just heaven help us.
[01:01:49.697 --> 01:01:50.178]  I know this.
[01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:58.195]  Going back into the 80s, homosexual prostitutes are literally lined up at the White House in every Republican administration.
[01:01:58.736 --> 01:01:59.516]  That's confirmed.
[01:02:00.797 --> 01:02:02.818]  I know that they're into all sorts of weird stuff.
[01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:06.121]  I believe John DeCamp's account, and it dovetails.
[01:02:07.001 --> 01:02:08.642]  I know there's mind control programs.
[01:02:08.823 --> 01:02:10.204]  I just don't know.
[01:02:10.904 --> 01:02:12.165]  I just don't know about their story.
[01:02:12.185 --> 01:02:13.006]  Okay.
[01:02:13.326 --> 01:02:14.847]  I wanted to ask you about that.
[01:02:14.867 --> 01:02:16.628]  Hopefully you have John Connor a little bit more.
[01:02:16.648 --> 01:02:17.809]  I think he's a really good guy.
[01:02:18.529 --> 01:02:20.511]  Hopefully get him going there and
[01:02:20.925 --> 01:02:22.547]  Well, I got him a show on Genesis.
[01:02:22.867 --> 01:02:23.488]  Yeah, I hear that.
[01:02:23.508 --> 01:02:25.090]  He needs to be on a couple more hours, I think.
[01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:26.351]  Well, that's what he requested.
[01:02:26.892 --> 01:02:27.312]  I hope so.
[01:02:27.332 --> 01:02:28.654]  John Connor was offered a Monday.
[01:02:28.834 --> 01:02:30.075]  Just so you know, the backside.
[01:02:30.376 --> 01:02:32.618]  I don't run Genesis, okay?
[01:02:32.779 --> 01:02:36.843]  And I don't, you know, I'm not involved in their advertising or any of their operations.
[01:02:36.903 --> 01:02:39.807]  Ted just knows I've got a good eye for talent and radio.
[01:02:40.687 --> 01:02:43.789]  Here I am trying to bring more competition on against myself because I don't care.
[01:02:44.009 --> 01:02:47.231]  I want to get more people built up and exposing the New World Order.
[01:02:47.552 --> 01:02:49.593]  So I called John up and I said, you want a radio show?
[01:02:49.613 --> 01:02:51.694]  And I said, how about weekdays or weeknights?
[01:02:51.714 --> 01:02:52.755]  He said, no, I'm too busy.
[01:02:52.775 --> 01:02:53.876]  You know, he works a nine to five.
[01:02:54.356 --> 01:02:57.258]  So I put him in touch with Ted and we gave him a radio show on the weekend.
[01:02:57.618 --> 01:03:00.420]  So when you say, well, he needs more time, well, you talk to John Connor.
[01:03:02.321 --> 01:03:02.861]  Anything else, sir?
[01:03:03.141 --> 01:03:04.322]  Hey, you do a great job, Alex.
[01:03:04.382 --> 01:03:05.363]  I keep listening to you.
[01:03:05.443 --> 01:03:06.924]  I hope you get on here in Ohio a bit more.
[01:03:06.944 --> 01:03:08.245]  I have to listen to you actually on the phone.
[01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:08.825]  I'm on hold.
[01:03:09.714 --> 01:03:11.695]  We need to get a computer.
[01:03:11.755 --> 01:03:13.935]  We've got two affiliates in Ohio.
[01:03:14.335 --> 01:03:15.075]  Yeah, I listened to it.
[01:03:15.095 --> 01:03:19.776]  It's like a replay on... I live in Worcester, Ohio, so it's a replay.
[01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:26.858]  I listened to the show from the day before, but... They put me on that station, great station, prime time in the morning.
[01:03:27.338 --> 01:03:27.678]  Okay.
[01:03:28.158 --> 01:03:28.378]  Right?
[01:03:28.418 --> 01:03:29.079]  That's the one?
[01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:32.059]  There's another Ohio station that has us on at night.
[01:03:32.179 --> 01:03:33.100]  I can't keep track of it all.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:33.700]  Thank you.
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:38.841]  Oh, by the way, we just got a 50,000 watt AM in this communications...
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:40.661]  In Norfolk.
[01:03:40.981 --> 01:03:42.562]  I mean, the thing covers like four states.
[01:03:43.263 --> 01:03:45.284]  We just got two affiliates in New York State.
[01:03:45.644 --> 01:03:49.287]  We just got Jacksonville, Florida, and two other stations.
[01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:51.948]  I mean, we're really growing fast now.
[01:03:56.451 --> 01:03:59.633]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:00.013 --> 01:04:01.935]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.315 --> 01:04:09.980]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:17.704]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.105 --> 01:04:21.006]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:21.427 --> 01:04:23.748]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.168 --> 01:04:24.989]  NSA spies.
[01:04:25.541 --> 01:04:26.882]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:26.902 --> 01:04:28.303]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:04:53.263 --> 01:04:54.044]  Terrorism.
[01:04:54.184 --> 01:04:54.944]  Terrorism.
[01:04:55.044 --> 01:04:55.885]  Chemical attacks.
[01:04:55.945 --> 01:04:56.605]  Dirty bombs.
[01:04:56.705 --> 01:04:57.126]  Fallout.
[01:04:57.206 --> 01:04:58.206]  Biological attack.
[01:04:58.386 --> 01:04:58.927]  Anthrax.
[01:04:58.987 --> 01:05:01.108]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:05:01.368 --> 01:05:02.970]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:05.691]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:06.072 --> 01:05:12.756]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne...
[01:05:12.756 --> 01:05:13.016]  I think?
[01:05:34.136 --> 01:05:40.866]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:40.926 --> 01:05:43.570]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:05:52.688 --> 01:05:57.250]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:05:57.650 --> 01:06:00.592]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:06:00.912 --> 01:06:03.473]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:06:03.833 --> 01:06:08.655]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:06:09.035 --> 01:06:14.398]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:06:14.718 --> 01:06:17.679]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[01:06:17.859 --> 01:06:19.580]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:29.523]  Many people believe that this will be the mark of the beast because of the restrictive measures included, which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13, 17.
[01:06:29.863 --> 01:06:36.145]  In Revelations 14, 9, speaking of the mark of the beast, it says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[01:06:36.485 --> 01:06:38.106]  It says, worship the beast.
[01:06:38.386 --> 01:06:40.987]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[01:06:41.267 --> 01:06:47.991]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:06:49.291 --> 01:06:52.033]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:06:53.053 --> 01:07:00.737]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:00.757 --> 01:07:08.341]  A couple of program notes here before we go to Scott Ritter, who needs no introduction, but we'll tell you about his new book.
[01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:21.673]  I am going to, of course, be live two hours in studio tonight, the second two hours, coast to coast on over 600 stations with George Norrie.
[01:07:22.133 --> 01:07:25.274]  He's going to be here in Austin doing his show out of KLBJ 590 AM.
[01:07:25.394 --> 01:07:36.438]  And I'm going to be going over the history of the New World Order and their operations, similar to what I did earlier this week but with more detail, what their master plan is.
[01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:38.210]  We're good to go.
[01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:39.090]  We're good to go.
[01:08:02.213 --> 01:08:05.574]  I also have some of my book, Descent into Tyranny, and some of my other videos there.
[01:08:06.474 --> 01:08:09.895]  If you'd like them, I'm going to give about a 30-45 minute speech.
[01:08:09.915 --> 01:08:11.155]  I always go longer than that.
[01:08:11.916 --> 01:08:18.977]  I'm going to give you a good one, and we're going to be there videotaping it for my television show and for the web at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:08:19.477 --> 01:08:21.278]  And I really haven't plugged this much this week.
[01:08:22.118 --> 01:08:28.980]  I did one other video signing, and they had like 200 people show up over the two hours that we had at Waterloo.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:30.981]  We're good to go.
[01:08:51.005 --> 01:08:55.088]  Organic grocery store, and they've got about 15 restaurants in the country.
[01:08:55.148 --> 01:08:57.009]  It's the mothership, the headquarters of Whole Foods.
[01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:58.910]  That's in the same giant complex.
[01:08:59.230 --> 01:09:05.853]  Plenty of parking there, free parking in the parking garage that's right next door to Book People.
[01:09:06.213 --> 01:09:09.915]  That is this Sunday, 8 to 10 p.m.
[01:09:10.496 --> 01:09:15.858]  So you can go to church and go and maybe take the children to dinner, and then I hope you come on over.
[01:09:16.199 --> 01:09:17.499]  Hope you bring the whole family.
[01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:18.640]  That's coming up.
[01:09:19.642 --> 01:09:22.204]  Black, white, old, young, you're all welcome.
[01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:30.451]  That's this Sunday, 8 to 10 p.m., Book People in downtown Austin on 6th and Lamar.
[01:09:30.491 --> 01:09:34.075]  We have details on the address up on InfoWars.com.
[01:09:34.095 --> 01:09:36.757]  Just remember, Book People this Sunday.
[01:09:38.498 --> 01:09:41.601]  And again, I will be on Coast to Coast AM this evening.
[01:09:42.182 --> 01:09:45.825]  Or I guess tomorrow morning, really, if you talk about Central or Eastern time.
[01:09:47.842 --> 01:09:49.362]  You know, he turned out to be completely right.
[01:09:49.442 --> 01:09:52.243]  He was a U.S., U.N.
[01:09:52.303 --> 01:09:55.804]  weapons inspector, former Marine Corps officer.
[01:09:56.444 --> 01:09:57.664]  He's over there in Iraq.
[01:09:58.244 --> 01:09:59.685]  He knows there's no WMDs.
[01:09:59.705 --> 01:10:01.905]  They'd all been destroyed by 92 in the huge U.N.
[01:10:01.925 --> 01:10:03.085]  destruction operation.
[01:10:04.486 --> 01:10:06.046]  And he went public.
[01:10:06.066 --> 01:10:08.766]  And so they tried to set him up with the normal stuff they do.
[01:10:09.107 --> 01:10:10.247]  We see it continually.
[01:10:10.287 --> 01:10:11.427]  It's always the same M.O.
[01:10:12.687 --> 01:10:13.968]  And that didn't work.
[01:10:14.148 --> 01:10:15.608]  And that all got proven to be a fraud.
[01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:20.232]  And he's written Scott Ritter, The Truth About the White House Plans for Regime Change.
[01:10:20.653 --> 01:10:24.415]  Target Iran is the book, and I just got it a week ago.
[01:10:24.435 --> 01:10:25.216]  I've only read part of it.
[01:10:25.256 --> 01:10:25.836]  It's excellent.
[01:10:26.256 --> 01:10:29.578]  It's everything I already knew from all my research and more I didn't know.
[01:10:30.299 --> 01:10:32.360]  And eight-tenths of this book is sourced.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.863]  I want to play a clip of Scott Ritter on another show before we introduce him.
[01:10:36.103 --> 01:10:36.563]  Here it is.
[01:10:36.903 --> 01:10:37.944]  You got that clip ready, John?
[01:10:38.945 --> 01:10:39.545]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:10:41.789 --> 01:10:52.862]  We're dealing with a Bush administration that has said that because of the total accumulation of power, economic, diplomatic, military power in the hands of the United States, that we can create our own reality.
[01:10:53.123 --> 01:11:00.992]  This makes it very difficult to engage in a logical debate with them because when you put out facts about the reality of Iran, they'll say you're dealing with old reality.
[01:11:01.607 --> 01:11:03.048]  You're not talking about the new reality.
[01:11:03.068 --> 01:11:08.132]  The new reality that we, America, can bring to the table by changing the way the world operates.
[01:11:08.533 --> 01:11:11.575]  Unfortunately, new reality is fanciful fiction.
[01:11:11.956 --> 01:11:15.779]  And it has manifested itself in this ongoing tragedy we call Iraq.
[01:11:16.139 --> 01:11:19.302]  I mean, October was one of the bloodiest months for Americans.
[01:11:19.762 --> 01:11:21.544]  And it's only going to get worse.
[01:11:21.824 --> 01:11:26.808]  Today the New York Times had a diagram that showed Iraq slipping towards chaos.
[01:11:26.848 --> 01:11:29.271]  That's the United States military saying this.
[01:11:29.591 --> 01:11:32.513]  And it's tracking only in one direction, towards chaos.
[01:11:32.714 --> 01:11:33.975]  There's no reversing, of course.
[01:11:34.395 --> 01:11:35.676]  We're getting beat in Iraq.
[01:11:35.716 --> 01:11:36.597]  It's a debacle.
[01:11:36.997 --> 01:11:40.781]  And yet the Bush administration says we can persevere in Iran.
[01:11:41.361 --> 01:11:42.062]  It's lunacy.
[01:11:44.071 --> 01:11:44.371]  It's a strategy.
[01:11:44.391 --> 01:11:45.451]  It's the global Balkans.
[01:11:45.511 --> 01:11:46.612]  It's a strategy of tension.
[01:11:46.672 --> 01:11:47.972]  It's to spread revolution.
[01:11:48.372 --> 01:11:50.673]  It's to spread uncertainty.
[01:11:50.913 --> 01:11:53.313]  And look at Lebanon right now going into civil war.
[01:11:53.354 --> 01:11:54.034]  That was the plan.
[01:11:54.074 --> 01:11:56.734]  It's to destroy all the nations around Israel.
[01:11:57.094 --> 01:11:59.015]  It's to destroy all the nations that have the oil.
[01:11:59.055 --> 01:12:02.556]  To bring them down to basically dirt floor caveman status.
[01:12:03.766 --> 01:12:05.627]  Scott Ritter is also a firefighter.
[01:12:05.647 --> 01:12:09.428]  Scott Ritter, sometimes he has to run away during the shows if he gets called.
[01:12:09.448 --> 01:12:11.589]  Scott Ritter, it's good to have you here with us.
[01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:12.209]  It's a pleasure.
[01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.570]  Thank you.
[01:12:33.298 --> 01:12:59.374]  For those who don't know who you are, just tell us about yourself, and kind of in a thumbnail synopsis or recap, your voyage, your travels, the soap opera you've been through, and then let's get into Iraq and how every military planner says that breaking the troops up into undefended substations will get even more killed, and yeah, we're now seeing record numbers dying, but just tell us about Scott Ritter.
[01:13:00.605 --> 01:13:28.138]  Born in a military family, raised around the world, went to college, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, joined the Marine Corps out of college, commissioned as an officer, became an intelligence officer, served in that role for a number of years, got involved in arms control, went over to the Soviet Union, implemented disarmament treaties there, fought in the first Gulf War, left the Marine Corps, joined the United Nations, became a weapons inspector, did that for seven years, resigned in 1998, spoke out against...
[01:13:30.279 --> 01:13:30.479]  U.S.
[01:13:30.519 --> 01:13:34.383]  policy on Iraq, and here I am today.
[01:13:36.304 --> 01:13:38.706]  And everything you said came true and worse.
[01:13:40.127 --> 01:13:51.237]  We now have the White House memo where they admit they premeditatedly wanted to stage WMD fines, premeditatedly have so-called defectors come out and lie, the yellow cake, all of it in triplicate,
[01:13:51.804 --> 01:13:54.805]  And now the Democrats are in, and they're, yeah, let's keep the war going.
[01:13:55.225 --> 01:13:58.066]  Bush is, you know, oh, we'll increase the troops.
[01:13:58.106 --> 01:14:01.267]  That gives the Democrats an out to then just speak out against the increase.
[01:14:01.547 --> 01:14:03.688]  What's really happening in Iraq right now, Scott Ritter?
[01:14:04.848 --> 01:14:10.870]  Well, I mean, what's really happening in Iraq is it's a chaotic slide towards anarchy and civil war.
[01:14:12.455 --> 01:14:15.437]  You heard of Midas and the golden touch.
[01:14:15.477 --> 01:14:17.257]  Everything he touches turns to gold.
[01:14:17.638 --> 01:14:19.519]  Bush seems to have the opposite effect.
[01:14:19.559 --> 01:14:23.120]  Everything he touches turns into an abject disaster.
[01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:29.344]  Iraq is proof positive that we haven't done anything right in Iraq.
[01:14:29.944 --> 01:14:33.946]  Some people say the initial invasion was conducted properly.
[01:14:34.026 --> 01:14:35.267]  I disagree totally.
[01:14:36.556 --> 01:14:48.328]  I wrote a book in 1998 called Endgame, and in there, one of the last chapters, I talked about how easy it would be to invade and defeat the Iraqi army and kick Saddam out of power.
[01:14:48.668 --> 01:14:49.549]  That's the easy thing.
[01:14:49.609 --> 01:14:53.193]  I predicted the number of troops and how long it would take and the number of casualties.
[01:14:54.675 --> 01:14:57.818]  But once you initiate that, you're in for the long haul.
[01:14:58.408 --> 01:15:00.449]  And I said, if we do this, we'll never get out.
[01:15:00.809 --> 01:15:02.270]  I mean, a lot of people recognize that.
[01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:06.651]  So the decision to invade Iraq in the first place was a bad decision.
[01:15:07.152 --> 01:15:11.914]  I mean, there was nothing done correctly on Iraq.
[01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:17.636]  And now we have a situation where the president is talking about surging troops into Iraq.
[01:15:17.816 --> 01:15:22.818]  I point out repeatedly to people that you cannot separate Iraq from the larger policy objectives
[01:15:23.416 --> 01:15:27.837]  Well, it's about widening it endlessly until there's no sovereign, independent nations over there.
[01:15:52.998 --> 01:15:55.820]  Yeah, it's about regional transformation.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:59.182]  I mean, the Bush administration has been right up front on this.
[01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:03.505]  This is why it surprises me when people scratch their head and say, well, they'd be lunatics to do this.
[01:16:03.545 --> 01:16:05.867]  Well, let's put the lunatic issue aside.
[01:16:06.287 --> 01:16:19.957]  They have stated up front for some time now that their policy objective in the Middle East is regional transformation, to take what we deem to be failed states or rogue states, eliminate them, and replace them
[01:16:20.532 --> 01:16:28.759]  With pro-American, and then I put democracies in quotation, because we really don't want democracies, because democracies represent the will of the people.
[01:16:28.819 --> 01:16:31.802]  Well, plus the 83 Israeli plan, the 2002 U.S.
[01:16:32.362 --> 01:16:39.108]  Pentagon plan, is really to destroy their industry, break them down, and keep them down, so they never rise again and are independent.
[01:16:39.868 --> 01:16:42.010]  Basically, it's just what they've done to Africa.
[01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:43.872]  It's about cutting them off at the legs.
[01:16:44.915 --> 01:16:50.480]  Well, there's no doubt that there's an Israeli element in the policy formulations.
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:17:02.570]  I mean, when you speak to Israelis, when you speak to policy formulators, they always put out the notion that the ideal would be for Israel to live in peaceful coexistence with its Arab and Muslim neighbors.
[01:17:02.670 --> 01:17:04.632]  But it's a military-industrial complex state.
[01:17:04.692 --> 01:17:06.253]  It wants permanent war.
[01:17:06.653 --> 01:17:10.176]  Well, it doesn't want neighbors who are truly sovereign.
[01:17:10.516 --> 01:17:12.138]  The last thing the Israeli...
[01:17:12.825 --> 01:17:13.045]  Lebanon!
[01:17:13.065 --> 01:17:13.205]  Lebanon!
[01:17:40.163 --> 01:17:41.824]  A party such as Hezbollah.
[01:17:42.204 --> 01:17:43.065]  Let's talk about that.
[01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:47.448]  In fact, they're descending into civil war, which is exactly what the Israelis wanted.
[01:17:47.528 --> 01:17:52.712]  I don't know if the Israelis want civil war per se.
[01:17:52.732 --> 01:17:56.355]  I think the Israelis want a situation that nullifies Hezbollah.
[01:17:56.435 --> 01:18:01.219]  And if chaos and civil war achieves that, then that would be...
[01:18:03.209 --> 01:18:05.170]  That obviously is what's happening today.
[01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:09.211]  Well, yeah, destabilization is the way to do it.
[01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:16.092]  When you can't militarily send your tanks in to the capital, well, the next best thing is just to destabilize.
[01:18:16.112 --> 01:18:16.573]  Correct.
[01:18:16.673 --> 01:18:17.793]  It's an alternative policy.
[01:18:17.813 --> 01:18:26.335]  But, I mean, if I had an Israeli policymaker here, they'd say the idea would be to have a strong central Lebanese government that suppressed Hezbollah.
[01:18:26.355 --> 01:18:27.655]  Well, that's not going to happen.
[01:18:27.695 --> 01:18:30.716]  So the alternative, of course, is destabilization operations.
[01:18:31.465 --> 01:18:31.865]  Stay there.
[01:18:31.885 --> 01:18:34.808]  I want to get your take on Iran, all the big developments.
[01:18:35.529 --> 01:18:38.951]  Top British politicians are saying, yeah, we're going to probably strike Iran.
[01:18:39.832 --> 01:18:41.393]  Bush is saying the same thing.
[01:18:42.034 --> 01:18:43.315]  They're really beating the war drums.
[01:18:43.335 --> 01:18:45.077]  Nancy Pelosi's spouting off.
[01:18:45.777 --> 01:18:47.979]  It's all happening, and the ships are lined up.
[01:18:48.019 --> 01:18:49.180]  The cruise missiles are ready.
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:50.241]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.772 --> 01:18:57.313]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:18:57.373 --> 01:18:57.873]  are located?
[01:18:58.093 --> 01:19:01.474]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:19:01.694 --> 01:19:06.416]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:19:06.696 --> 01:19:11.677]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[01:19:11.857 --> 01:19:12.537]  We're good to go.
[01:19:30.626 --> 01:19:37.572]  I hope you zero in on the best places to live, the ideal location for cabins and vacation homes, as well as safe and unsafe areas.

[01:19:53.785 --> 01:19:56.267]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:57.028 --> 01:19:59.650]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:20:00.382 --> 01:20:16.531]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[01:20:17.492 --> 01:20:22.695]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[01:20:23.522 --> 01:20:31.468]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:32.489 --> 01:20:33.010]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.310]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:34.771]  The call is free.
[01:20:34.791 --> 01:20:39.134]  Our operators are standing by to take your order for a year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:54.799 --> 01:20:55.839]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:01.722]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:21:02.302 --> 01:21:02.802]  That's right.
[01:21:03.102 --> 01:21:05.403]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:05.963 --> 01:21:12.866]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:21:13.439 --> 01:21:21.142]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:21.582 --> 01:21:26.364]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:21:27.046 --> 01:21:32.068]  If you'd like to take a look at gold-free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:32.869 --> 01:21:36.990]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:37.631]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:37.651 --> 01:21:39.571]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:21:39.591 --> 01:21:39.932]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:40.252 --> 01:21:40.512]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:55.003 --> 01:21:59.125]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:21:59.345 --> 01:22:01.106]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:22:01.366 --> 01:22:07.650]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:14.073]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:22:14.313 --> 01:22:16.174]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument
[01:22:16.434 --> 01:22:16.735]  I think.
[01:22:31.374 --> 01:22:31.434]  1-866-885-6625
[01:23:11.217 --> 01:23:19.221]  The UN says Iran plans nuclear development.
[01:23:20.542 --> 01:23:25.264]  And so see, now they're getting in line to put out the propaganda that they're going to weaponize it.
[01:23:26.181 --> 01:23:28.122]  Iran attack possible, says Cameron.
[01:23:28.142 --> 01:23:36.686]  A preemptive military strike against Iran involving British troops could be launched under a conservative government after David Cameron yesterday refused to rule out the use of force against the Gulf state.
[01:23:37.266 --> 01:23:38.006]  Bush, U.S.
[01:23:38.026 --> 01:23:40.127]  troops may protect themselves against Iranians.
[01:23:40.527 --> 01:23:42.808]  Of course they can protect themselves because anybody's shooting at them.
[01:23:43.188 --> 01:23:44.469]  But no, this just means going around...
[01:23:45.269 --> 01:23:51.734]  I guess preemptively hitting Iranian delegates, and they already arrested a bunch of their ambassadors, a bunch of their diplomatic corps.
[01:23:52.115 --> 01:23:54.757]  Bush says he's the decision-maker on Iraq.
[01:23:55.557 --> 01:23:58.019]  We've got the Democrats saying, yeah, we may have to hit Iran.
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:00.001]  You've been studying this.
[01:24:00.081 --> 01:24:02.763]  Your new book is out, Target Iran, Scott Ritter.
[01:24:03.363 --> 01:24:04.544]  What do you see happening?
[01:24:04.564 --> 01:24:07.407]  It just came out this week from a State Department former official.
[01:24:07.427 --> 01:24:13.011]  They're planning to hit their Navy, hundreds of military sites, a huge bombardment, maybe even going to the West.
[01:24:14.142 --> 01:24:15.143]  When do you think it will happen?
[01:24:15.223 --> 01:24:15.844]  Will it happen?
[01:24:15.904 --> 01:24:16.624]  How do we stop it?
[01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:21.968]  If they do go in, what do you think the global aftermath is going to be, militarily and economically?
[01:24:23.209 --> 01:24:36.980]  Well, I mean, first of all, I think we need to take seriously the fact that we have a president and administration that has articulated the desire to remove the regime currently in place in Tehran from power.
[01:24:37.361 --> 01:24:41.404]  And they say they will accomplish this task before the end of the president's
[01:24:42.094 --> 01:24:42.414]  Ten years.
[01:24:42.434 --> 01:24:47.558]  So obviously we're dealing with a situation where we're talking about something happening within the next two years.
[01:24:48.759 --> 01:24:51.541]  I happen to believe that time is the enemy of this president.
[01:24:51.801 --> 01:25:06.651]  This man's incompetencies as a leader are gradually being recognized by even a complacent Congress that has punted on almost every one of its obligations to the American people and the Constitution.
[01:25:06.711 --> 01:25:08.092]  Congress is starting to wake up.
[01:25:10.194 --> 01:25:10.554]  And so...
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:16.344]  When you realize that he has to act sooner than later, you say, well, what's the soonest he could act?
[01:25:16.364 --> 01:25:19.107]  And the answer is March.
[01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:31.019]  There are certain things that have to occur before the strike can take place, because I think you're absolutely correct in those people who are talking about the plans that they are cognizant of are right on the money.
[01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:32.660]  This isn't going to be a limited strike.
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:35.283]  This isn't going to be a one- or two-day operation where we go in
[01:25:35.819 --> 01:25:36.659]  We're good to go.
[01:25:57.114 --> 01:25:57.214]  I.E.
[01:25:57.254 --> 01:26:00.798]  internal CIA teams are going to foment riots to come and side with us as they tried three years ago.
[01:26:14.475 --> 01:26:18.000]  I think the CIA has plans in place to do that.
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.802]  Whether or not they'll succeed is another question.
[01:26:19.822 --> 01:26:20.984]  I believe they won't succeed.
[01:26:21.024 --> 01:26:30.056]  I think anybody who believes that the Iranian people are going to rise up in the aftermath of an American-led bombing of Iran, especially the massive bombing that we're talking about,
[01:26:32.256 --> 01:26:47.184]  Well, all of the independent analysts and historians and policy makers have said that this will actually, it's a no-brainer, unify the people that are somewhat against Ahmadinejad, will actually unify them to him.
[01:26:47.945 --> 01:26:56.950]  The irony is, right now, if I were in a policy position in Washington, D.C., I could have Ahmadinejad removed from office within six months.
[01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:59.570]  By making deals, by making concessions.
[01:26:59.730 --> 01:27:05.053]  Perhaps I'd go straight to, first of all, the first thing I'd do is I'd say, we ignore Ahmedinejad.
[01:27:05.073 --> 01:27:06.773]  I don't want to mention his name anymore.
[01:27:07.294 --> 01:27:08.174]  He's not a player.
[01:27:08.494 --> 01:27:10.355]  We're only going to deal with the Supreme Leader.
[01:27:10.755 --> 01:27:18.559]  Then I reach out to the Iranian Parliament, and I say, and I'll deal with you, but you've got to liberate yourselves from that which is weighing you down.
[01:27:18.619 --> 01:27:20.520]  Again, not mentioning the man's name.
[01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:23.652]  And the Iranian Parliament will come up with a vote of no confidence.
[01:27:23.712 --> 01:27:24.872]  They'll call for a new election.
[01:27:24.932 --> 01:27:30.236]  The Supreme Leader and the Guardian Council will support a new slate of... They've been saying they want a deal.
[01:27:30.896 --> 01:27:31.436]  Absolutely.
[01:27:31.797 --> 01:27:38.300]  But the deal requires the Bush administration to recognize the legitimacy of that government, the viability of that government.
[01:27:38.341 --> 01:27:42.463]  And if your policy is to remove that government from power, that's the last thing you're going to do.
[01:27:43.584 --> 01:27:44.824]  But look at the last president.
[01:27:45.005 --> 01:27:47.686]  He was a moderate and tried to play ball, and they snubbed him.
[01:27:48.006 --> 01:27:48.907]  They wanted a radical.
[01:27:49.873 --> 01:27:53.576]  And unfortunately, I have to run right now because the fire alarm just went off.
[01:27:54.276 --> 01:27:55.497]  We've got a structure fire in town.
[01:27:56.098 --> 01:27:56.538]  I hear it.
[01:27:56.698 --> 01:27:57.079]  I know.
[01:27:57.119 --> 01:27:57.859]  It's happened before.
[01:27:57.899 --> 01:27:58.620]  Thank you, Scott.
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.480]  We'll reschedule.
[01:27:59.921 --> 01:28:00.481]  Sorry about that.
[01:28:00.581 --> 01:28:00.841]  Okay.
[01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:01.442]  Take care.
[01:28:01.462 --> 01:28:03.864]  Yeah, I can hear the radio there in the background, folks.
[01:28:03.884 --> 01:28:05.345]  I don't know if you can make that out, but I heard it.
[01:28:06.886 --> 01:28:10.389]  I've had Scott on about six times, and that's the second time that's happened.
[01:28:10.449 --> 01:28:17.314]  He lives in a small town, and it's the fire department, and he's got a house on fire.
[01:28:18.010 --> 01:28:19.151]  Or something, a structure fire.
[01:28:19.631 --> 01:28:20.691]  So there goes Scott Ritter.
[01:28:20.711 --> 01:28:22.312]  Somebody forgot to turn the oven off.
[01:28:22.893 --> 01:28:24.213]  Or the stove top with the grease.
[01:28:24.233 --> 01:28:26.835]  So we don't get to continue the interview.
[01:28:27.015 --> 01:28:29.016]  But we've got loaded phone lines and I've got a bunch of news.
[01:28:29.056 --> 01:28:31.897]  And I'll continue with Iran.
[01:28:31.917 --> 01:28:34.599]  1-800-259-9231 I was wanting to get to your calls anyway.
[01:28:34.619 --> 01:28:38.841]  So this is kind of fortuitous in a way.
[01:28:38.861 --> 01:28:40.702]  1-800-259-9231 We'll come back, go to your calls.
[01:28:40.942 --> 01:28:42.383]  Any issue you want to talk about, stay with me.
[01:28:43.823 --> 01:28:44.704]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.204 --> 01:28:46.705]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.718 --> 01:28:50.407]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.937 --> 01:28:57.899]  I found this company online, and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:28:58.139 --> 01:29:01.661]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:29:01.941 --> 01:29:06.043]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:29:06.323 --> 01:29:07.263]  I was so amazed.
[01:29:07.483 --> 01:29:10.344]  I put it in the baby's room, and it made a perfect nightlight.
[01:29:10.525 --> 01:29:12.425]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:29:12.786 --> 01:29:17.988]  SolelyWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:29:18.448 --> 01:29:24.374]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[01:29:24.654 --> 01:29:26.375]  I figured it would clean really well.
[01:29:26.616 --> 01:29:29.799]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:29:29.999 --> 01:29:33.902]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[01:29:34.163 --> 01:29:35.664]  Plus, the service was great.
[01:29:35.984 --> 01:29:40.649]  If you're interested in natural, homeopathic, time-tested remedies, visit SoleilWellness.com.
[01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:44.917]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness.com or call 312-224-2710.
[01:29:44.937 --> 01:29:44.977]  312-224-2710.
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:55.921]  Come on, Bill.
[01:29:56.141 --> 01:30:01.364]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:30:01.724 --> 01:30:03.205]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:30:03.305 --> 01:30:05.287]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:30:05.587 --> 01:30:11.170]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:17.754]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:30:18.114 --> 01:30:20.336]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:30:20.616 --> 01:30:22.397]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[01:30:24.298 --> 01:30:24.718]  Whoa.
[01:30:25.098 --> 01:30:26.319]  What was that website again?
[01:30:26.419 --> 01:30:29.921]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:30:30.221 --> 01:30:31.342]  Now write this down, John.
[01:30:31.482 --> 01:30:35.844]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:30:35.984 --> 01:30:36.564]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:30:36.844 --> 01:30:38.065]  I'm going there right now.
[01:30:38.485 --> 01:30:39.165]  Check, please.
[01:30:40.946 --> 01:30:42.407]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:30:42.907 --> 01:30:43.487]  Sure, John.
[01:30:43.728 --> 01:30:48.110]  Don't forget, it's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:50.131]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:30:50.291 --> 01:30:50.551]  Deal.
[01:30:52.611 --> 01:30:57.395]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:30:57.615 --> 01:31:01.598]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:31:01.858 --> 01:31:08.162]  As you may have heard by now, Ken Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:31:08.403 --> 01:31:12.786]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.

[01:32:04.791 --> 01:32:16.156]  Our imaginers became, well, a ragtag band to bring a revolution.
[01:32:17.897 --> 01:32:23.940]  Some would make them change, and others couldn't stand for that.
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:29.943]  The cross was a solution, but it rose again.
[01:32:31.813 --> 01:32:33.576]  We're good to go.
[01:32:34.497 --> 01:32:36.279]  We're good to go.
[01:32:37.881 --> 01:32:39.283]  We're good to go.
[01:32:39.303 --> 01:32:41.145]  We're good to go.
[01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:59.356]  They railed against the crowd Another ragtag band
[01:33:21.517 --> 01:33:29.383]  Thanks to the renegades For free today Thanks to the renegades
[01:33:48.709 --> 01:34:18.281]  I'm afraid today Thank God for the renegades And the lives they lead Far ahead of Their time Without the renegades Lord knows where we'd be When it comes to heroes Renegades are mine Heroes Renegades are mine
[01:34:19.341 --> 01:34:19.861]  Welcome back.
[01:34:19.921 --> 01:34:23.602]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:23.962 --> 01:34:27.463]  I'll get more into Iran and more of the other international news here in a moment, but let's get to some calls.
[01:34:28.264 --> 01:34:29.784]  Tim, where are you calling us from today?
[01:34:30.584 --> 01:34:30.865]  Hello?
[01:34:31.185 --> 01:34:31.445]  Yes, sir.
[01:34:31.465 --> 01:34:32.225]  Where are you calling from today?
[01:34:32.285 --> 01:34:33.425]  I'm calling from Montana.
[01:34:33.765 --> 01:34:34.226]  Welcome.
[01:34:34.786 --> 01:34:37.647]  Yeah, I want to say you do a bunch of really good work.
[01:34:37.827 --> 01:34:40.127]  I just have a couple problems.
[01:34:40.487 --> 01:34:45.469]  I've heard you and Mr. Gibson talk about the Vatican and stuff.
[01:34:46.004 --> 01:34:52.649]  And I want to let you know one thing that the Vatican knows and is looking for that's coming up in 2007.
[01:34:53.650 --> 01:34:58.653]  But there were some things that happened in 99 that you guys aren't aware of.
[01:34:59.454 --> 01:35:09.821]  The Pope was told that things were going to... He was expecting someone in 1999, and it was fulfilled on Christmas Eve of 1999.
[01:35:09.861 --> 01:35:12.783]  And then I know more than one person...
[01:35:15.595 --> 01:35:16.456]  We're good to go.
[01:35:39.399 --> 01:35:42.262]  The Antichrist religion, which is what it says in the book.
[01:35:42.302 --> 01:35:43.363]  But we talked about that.
[01:35:43.403 --> 01:35:46.886]  We talked about the pub column for A New World Order and One World Religion.
[01:35:47.566 --> 01:36:03.219]  Yeah, but he doesn't want how it's being portrayed is that Catholicism or the basic tenets of the church after the purification will become the religion.
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.363]  It will only be a Christian world after the purification.
[01:36:08.522 --> 01:36:10.504]  Well, I mean, to be clear, sir, I'm not a Catholic.
[01:36:10.564 --> 01:36:12.005]  In fact, I'm non-denominational.
[01:36:12.606 --> 01:36:12.826]  Right.
[01:36:12.966 --> 01:36:13.506]  I understand.
[01:36:14.327 --> 01:36:18.110]  And I was having Hutton Gibson on because it was interesting and it was informative.
[01:36:18.170 --> 01:36:23.775]  And regardless of whether the church was bad 100 years ago or if it's good now, we know it's bad now.
[01:36:23.815 --> 01:36:25.036]  Well, it's not good now.
[01:36:25.116 --> 01:36:25.977]  Obviously, that's what I'm saying.
[01:36:26.918 --> 01:36:28.459]  Let me just say something real quick.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:33.163]  What I'm saying is, regardless, we know now it's not good.
[01:36:33.803 --> 01:36:35.565]  We know now it's pro-one world government.
[01:36:35.605 --> 01:36:36.746]  It's pushing all these things.
[01:36:38.315 --> 01:36:39.035]  Parts of it are.
[01:36:39.475 --> 01:36:41.616]  But what they're expecting, let me just tell you that.
[01:36:42.316 --> 01:36:46.877]  And what they were told in 1999... Yeah, you've already told us that.
[01:36:47.057 --> 01:36:49.037]  Just say it.
[01:36:49.197 --> 01:36:56.139]  Yeah, in 2007, the first trumpet, and that's what they were told in 1999, is that the period had begun.
[01:36:56.159 --> 01:37:06.461]  And so what's going to happen, what they've been told this year, if you read it, I think it's 8-7 in the Book of Revelations, the first trumpet, all the grass,
[01:37:07.290 --> 01:37:11.613]  Okay, listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:19.337]  I grew up with people saying Jesus was coming in 88, and I grew up with people always saying it's next month, it's next year, it's tomorrow.
[01:37:19.737 --> 01:37:21.579]  I just cover the news and the information.
[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:35.947]  And, you know, callers call in, and they call in almost every show, and they talk about the Vatican and the Jesuits and all the things that are going on, and you come on air and you say it.
[01:37:37.867 --> 01:37:38.327]  We're good to go.
[01:38:08.177 --> 01:38:09.678]  Since I got back from vacation.
[01:38:10.838 --> 01:38:15.799]  I had the guy on that very day, and that night I'm getting an email and a post saying I'm bad.
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:19.941]  So, I mean, my gosh, we try to cover it all.
[01:38:20.001 --> 01:38:29.344]  It's a big world, a lot of stuff happening in it, and I think a lot of that started with, Alex won't talk about the Catholics.
[01:38:30.736 --> 01:38:38.462]  Because one of the main people that pushes the whole idea that the Vatican runs everything instead of the Vatican being just part of the New World Order.
[01:38:38.842 --> 01:38:39.843]  And again, there's no debate there.
[01:38:39.863 --> 01:38:40.723]  It's part of the New World Order.
[01:38:41.204 --> 01:38:42.565]  Okay, it's pushing for a one world government.
[01:38:42.885 --> 01:38:43.986]  Okay, it's doing all this stuff.
[01:38:44.026 --> 01:38:44.686]  Sure, yeah.
[01:38:45.146 --> 01:38:46.067]  Ratzinger says it.
[01:38:47.168 --> 01:38:51.491]  No, but you don't say it right.
[01:38:52.432 --> 01:38:53.152]  There's no debate.
[01:38:53.252 --> 01:38:53.753]  Move on.
[01:38:55.334 --> 01:38:57.215]  Every major institution is controlled by it.
[01:38:58.911 --> 01:39:10.444]  But this stuff started because there's this individual who pushes the whole Vatican thing just constantly and makes up a lot of stuff because I know he makes up about me.
[01:39:12.166 --> 01:39:19.595]  And I get these bullying phone calls and these bullying calls on air and these bullying emails and you better interview me or I'll expose you as a...
[01:39:20.456 --> 01:39:24.720]  As a Vatican bloodsucker, and then Alex works for them.
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:26.941]  And folks, I know that's a total lie.
[01:39:27.382 --> 01:39:33.687]  So when people lie about me, there's no way I'm ever going to be bullied or intimidated into interviewing them.
[01:39:34.147 --> 01:39:40.172]  And so then it just gets worse, and I'm even more of a devil, and she, there's the proof, and why won't you talk to this person?
[01:39:40.833 --> 01:39:45.677]  And then people have no idea I don't talk to them because they're just unbelievably wicked.
[01:39:48.132 --> 01:39:49.492]  I mean, I don't know what else you could say.
[01:39:49.532 --> 01:39:50.573]  I'm pretty easy to approach.
[01:39:50.613 --> 01:39:52.073]  It's pretty easy to get on this show.
[01:39:53.273 --> 01:39:58.415]  I'm just a down-to-earth person, but if people out of the gates are bullying me, I go, hey, man, I don't put up with bullies.
[01:40:00.856 --> 01:40:06.197]  So the false statements are made that, you know, they're just incredibly ridiculous, folks.
[01:40:07.197 --> 01:40:09.898]  And, you know, it's kind of funny, though.
[01:40:09.918 --> 01:40:11.739]  I mean, I've been promoted.
[01:40:11.759 --> 01:40:16.000]  I'm like this big supreme Jesuit commander.
[01:40:16.829 --> 01:40:31.799]  With all this power, and of course, I'm also a 33rd degree mason, and I'm also the head of PR for Scientology, and I'm also a New York Times writer, and I've got an NPR radio show, and I own huge factories in Canada and England.
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.141]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:40:36.302 --> 01:40:42.686]  I'm a 32-year-old, about to be 33-year-old, from Texas, and there's a guy named Alex Jones who's the...
[01:40:44.364 --> 01:40:47.465]  One of the PR people for Scientology is almost, I think he's like 60 years old now.
[01:40:48.225 --> 01:40:48.805]  Black hair.
[01:40:50.066 --> 01:40:51.286]  Weighs about 300 pounds.
[01:40:51.306 --> 01:40:52.807]  I only weigh 240 pounds.
[01:40:53.067 --> 01:40:53.947]  It's not me, man!
[01:40:55.007 --> 01:40:57.128]  And every day I get emails on that stuff.
[01:40:57.148 --> 01:41:00.169]  You need to answer for how you run Scientology!
[01:41:01.569 --> 01:41:04.830]  You need to answer this that you're a Vatican assassin!
[01:41:05.890 --> 01:41:07.931]  You need to answer this that you're a Mason!
[01:41:09.326 --> 01:41:10.549]  You need to answer this.
[01:41:10.649 --> 01:41:11.130]  It's you.
[01:41:11.771 --> 01:41:13.495]  You've got a show on NPR.
[01:41:13.575 --> 01:41:14.317]  No, I don't.
[01:41:14.678 --> 01:41:18.506]  That's a Pulitzer Prize winner, Alex S. Jones, that runs the Shorrentine Center.
[01:41:19.617 --> 01:41:21.377]  And people say, you need to answer this.
[01:41:21.418 --> 01:41:22.498]  You need to answer this.
[01:41:22.798 --> 01:41:23.918]  You need to answer this.
[01:41:23.938 --> 01:41:24.878]  You need to answer this.
[01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:31.280]  Folks, the things you send me saying, I need to answer this right now, I've already answered in 100 emails.
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.901]  And I can't just spend my time going, no, it's not true.
[01:41:34.121 --> 01:41:39.282]  And the few times I do, the weirdo listeners that are into picking at me will take it as like some power thing.
[01:41:39.302 --> 01:41:40.443]  Ooh, I've got you.
[01:41:40.623 --> 01:41:42.243]  Well, see, you really didn't answer it.
[01:41:43.103 --> 01:41:44.544]  It isn't about me, okay?
[01:41:44.564 --> 01:41:45.864]  They devalued your dollar.
[01:41:46.610 --> 01:41:47.770]  They're imploding the border.
[01:41:48.231 --> 01:41:51.192]  They're about to launch World War III against Iran.
[01:41:52.552 --> 01:41:54.173]  You've got all these religious people.
[01:41:54.193 --> 01:41:57.574]  They're not really Christians running around saying the end's next month, so who cares?
[01:41:58.614 --> 01:42:00.055]  You've got all this craziness.
[01:42:00.155 --> 01:42:02.616]  I'm just here trying to warn you, hoping you'll do something.
[01:42:03.036 --> 01:42:08.538]  But instead, people subconsciously have ways to sabotage themselves so they don't have to face the big issues.
[01:42:08.758 --> 01:42:10.859]  They'd rather debate the messenger all day.
[01:42:10.879 --> 01:42:14.900]  All right, I said I'd go to calls, and I'm already getting bogged down here.
[01:42:16.768 --> 01:42:17.569]  Who's up next here?
[01:42:19.489 --> 01:42:20.430]  Jason in Connecticut.
[01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:20.950]  You're on the air.
[01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:21.370]  Go ahead.
[01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:22.491]  Hey, what's going on, man?
[01:42:22.871 --> 01:42:24.791]  Doing a national, international radio show.
[01:42:26.752 --> 01:42:31.014]  Hey, that was an awesome interview you had with David Lynch the other day.
[01:42:31.414 --> 01:42:34.775]  Well, you know, I'm not going to be dishonest with my listeners.
[01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:39.717]  We told him up front two months ago when he first went public, or a month and a half ago, whatever it was,
[01:42:40.956 --> 01:42:46.279]  And we found out they were aware of our work, knew what we were doing, and I found that out again a month ago when I was in L.A.
[01:42:46.339 --> 01:42:47.519]  through some back-channel talk.
[01:42:47.859 --> 01:42:52.802]  And then we had them lined up, and then the day of the interview they said, well, now we don't want to talk about 9-11.
[01:42:54.185 --> 01:42:54.645]  We're good to go.
[01:42:54.665 --> 01:42:55.025]  We're good to go.
[01:43:18.608 --> 01:43:19.729]  But, you know, I just can't help it.
[01:43:19.789 --> 01:43:24.492]  I can't get a host up here and talk about coffee lines and new age books.
[01:43:24.632 --> 01:43:26.953]  I've got to... You know, he talked about 9-11.
[01:43:26.973 --> 01:43:27.833]  I'm a big fan.
[01:43:27.893 --> 01:43:28.914]  He's a great artist.
[01:43:29.474 --> 01:43:32.476]  And it's so important for his fans for them to hear him say more.
[01:43:33.156 --> 01:43:34.357]  But you said you liked the interview.
[01:43:34.377 --> 01:43:34.937]  What did you think of it?
[01:43:35.677 --> 01:43:38.159]  I mean, I'm glad you didn't let him, like, off the hook.
[01:43:38.639 --> 01:43:43.341]  Because I know that's, like, why people want to hear him.
[01:43:43.581 --> 01:43:46.083]  Yeah, one of my colleagues likened it to when...
[01:43:47.461 --> 01:43:55.145]  The Ed Sullivan Show told the singer that he couldn't say certain things in the song, and he just did it anyways.
[01:43:55.625 --> 01:43:58.386]  I mean, I just, you know, I'm always somebody, I'm not treacherous.
[01:43:58.446 --> 01:43:59.347]  I do things up front.
[01:44:00.227 --> 01:44:04.009]  And they said they'd do the interview and talk about it, and then they tried to back out.
[01:44:04.129 --> 01:44:05.810]  And they said, we'll cancel if you're going to do this.
[01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:08.031]  And I said, well, I may not be able to control myself.
[01:44:08.071 --> 01:44:08.671]  They still did it.
[01:44:08.932 --> 01:44:10.232]  So I think David wants to talk.
[01:44:10.472 --> 01:44:11.513]  But, sorry, go ahead.
[01:44:11.953 --> 01:44:15.915]  Hey, look, the real reason I wanted to call is I want to talk about Ron Paul a little bit.
[01:44:17.156 --> 01:44:22.978]  I started a group on MySpace last Saturday, the 13th, and it already has over 800 members.
[01:44:24.178 --> 01:44:26.939]  How long can the media ignore this guy?
[01:44:27.319 --> 01:44:29.520]  He's turning into a 1,000-ton gorilla in the room.
[01:44:32.361 --> 01:44:34.162]  Well, they will try to ignore him.
[01:44:34.922 --> 01:44:38.543]  But if he can win New Hampshire or do well in New Hampshire...
[01:44:39.835 --> 01:44:44.237]  It could cause a pro-type chain reaction.
[01:44:44.757 --> 01:44:46.878]  He's a much better candidate than Tom Tancredo.
[01:44:46.919 --> 01:44:48.059]  I like Tom Tancredo.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:53.622]  He isn't in the same league, the same ballpark, the same universe.
[01:44:55.463 --> 01:44:57.744]  Ron Paul is founding father-type material.
[01:44:58.784 --> 01:45:01.626]  And I totally support him.
[01:45:01.646 --> 01:45:06.128]  And we've been putting banners on the websites and promoting, telling folks to contribute.
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:16.514]  And regardless, even if he isn't going to win, and he has a chance to, even with election fraud, because it's not total, he will educate people in the platform.
[01:45:16.835 --> 01:45:18.477]  He will educate people at debates.
[01:45:18.918 --> 01:45:20.861]  He will educate people on the campaign trail.
[01:45:22.365 --> 01:45:25.247]  And it wouldn't matter if he had no chance of winning.
[01:45:25.328 --> 01:45:27.489]  We have to support the right cause.
[01:45:27.970 --> 01:45:30.311]  See, most people gauge it and go, I want to be with a winner.
[01:45:30.752 --> 01:45:35.956]  But if that winner is bought and paid for by foreign banks, you call it a lesser of two evils, it isn't a lesser.
[01:45:36.276 --> 01:45:39.258]  And if people just follow their conscience, we wouldn't be in this position.
[01:45:39.518 --> 01:45:40.659]  So I'm supporting Ron Paul 110%.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:50.947]  I want to encourage everybody who has a MySpace to go join that group because the more members that there is in the group, the more recognition the group gets.
[01:45:51.368 --> 01:45:55.091]  And it'll go higher up on the political groups.
[01:45:55.511 --> 01:46:05.538]  The only thing that you need to do is just search for Ron Paul for president, and it'll be front and center, or go on to your... Well, are you the person that keeps posting on my InfoWars MySpace account?
[01:46:05.818 --> 01:46:09.080]  That's probably how I've gotten most of the people to join me.
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:12.782]  Yeah, so folks can just go to InfoWars.com.
[01:46:12.922 --> 01:46:17.205]  There's a banner in the middle of the page to my MySpace account, which I never really promote.
[01:46:17.225 --> 01:46:17.666]  I should.
[01:46:17.686 --> 01:46:18.666]  It's got like 21,000 members now.
[01:46:20.454 --> 01:46:23.536]  And you can go through and find the picture of Ron Paul.
[01:46:24.116 --> 01:46:27.778]  I've been posting it.
[01:46:29.279 --> 01:46:30.960]  Hey man, listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:46:32.241 --> 01:46:34.522]  I don't mind you spamming Ron Paul on my webpage.
[01:46:34.602 --> 01:46:37.584]  Just give other people a chance to have their post too.
[01:46:39.365 --> 01:46:43.307]  Sometimes people are patriots on the site, but they'll post their thing ten times in a row.
[01:46:44.045 --> 01:46:44.505]  We're good to go.
[01:46:44.525 --> 01:46:44.745]  I think?
[01:47:03.214 --> 01:47:03.735]  I'm already digressing.
[01:47:32.449 --> 01:47:34.310]  My MySpace account is there.
[01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:43.914]  We accept everybody, as long as you don't post porn and things like that, or as long as you're not calling for killing people.
[01:47:45.695 --> 01:47:46.575]  I never really promote it.
[01:47:46.595 --> 01:47:48.156]  We'd like you to join our MySpace account.
[01:47:48.876 --> 01:47:50.157]  Go join his Ron Paul account.
[01:47:50.917 --> 01:47:52.538]  Let's talk to Paula in Florida.
[01:47:52.578 --> 01:47:53.398]  Paula, welcome.
[01:47:53.979 --> 01:47:54.619]  Hi, Alex.
[01:47:54.759 --> 01:47:56.220]  You're doing a wonderful job.
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:56.800]  Thank you.
[01:47:57.054 --> 01:47:59.396]  And there's something I want to tell the people of this country.
[01:47:59.856 --> 01:48:03.738]  Wake up and realize Alex is God's watchman, and he's there.
[01:48:03.858 --> 01:48:05.019]  God has appointed him.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:07.360]  Well, I don't want to say that.
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:08.721]  I'm just a person doing my duty.
[01:48:09.182 --> 01:48:11.283]  I'm saying it because this is exactly what's happening.
[01:48:11.783 --> 01:48:15.646]  But anyway, I wanted to also say great about Ron Paul.
[01:48:16.066 --> 01:48:18.027]  He's the best thing that happened to us for a long time.
[01:48:18.948 --> 01:48:24.311]  And this thing about our border guards, I just talked to the reps.
[01:48:24.371 --> 01:48:25.952]  I told them what I was going to say on your program.
[01:48:26.627 --> 01:48:31.611]  I want everybody to call the FBI, and I want everybody to bring charges against the President and Gonzalez.
[01:48:33.272 --> 01:48:34.733]  Well, I appreciate your call, Paula.
[01:48:35.133 --> 01:48:35.874]  God bless you, hon.
[01:48:36.134 --> 01:48:36.594]  Take care.
[01:48:37.295 --> 01:48:38.336]  That needs to happen.
[01:48:40.437 --> 01:48:46.482]  But we need state or federal grand juries to begin investigations.
[01:48:47.943 --> 01:48:50.045]  And it's like getting Al Capone on tax evasion.
[01:48:51.045 --> 01:48:53.227]  You get him on the thing you can prove.
[01:48:54.611 --> 01:48:55.191]  Not the St.
[01:48:55.291 --> 01:48:57.673]  Valentine's Day massacre in Chicago.
[01:48:57.893 --> 01:49:00.534]  You get him on what you got him dead to rights on.
[01:49:01.655 --> 01:49:03.136]  That White House memo is high treason.
[01:49:04.477 --> 01:49:06.458]  Planting WMDs in Iraq.
[01:49:06.858 --> 01:49:10.060]  Staging defectors going public saying that they saw them.
[01:49:11.441 --> 01:49:12.181]  And that's what it says.
[01:49:12.261 --> 01:49:13.842]  It is the President's words.
[01:49:14.482 --> 01:49:15.543]  It is a transcript.
[01:49:17.190 --> 01:49:18.611]  And the White House admits it's real.
[01:49:18.711 --> 01:49:19.951]  British intelligence leaked it.
[01:49:20.451 --> 01:49:22.152]  Bush is real mad and says, yeah, it's authentic.
[01:49:22.612 --> 01:49:26.494]  I mean, right there, lying premeditatedly to take us to war.
[01:49:27.794 --> 01:49:28.194]  It's huge.
[01:49:28.955 --> 01:49:30.775]  What about No-Brainer, North American Union?
[01:49:30.815 --> 01:49:33.656]  He signed that in 2005, in March.
[01:49:33.676 --> 01:49:37.358]  They expanded it a few months later in December with another addendum he signed.
[01:49:38.258 --> 01:49:40.579]  A caveat of... And, uh...
[01:49:41.690 --> 01:49:41.970]  Boom!
[01:49:42.010 --> 01:49:48.873]  Getting rid of our sovereignty, merging our trade, our military, our social security, our everything.
[01:49:49.793 --> 01:49:50.734]  Our transportation.
[01:49:53.935 --> 01:49:59.938]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.358 --> 01:50:02.279]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.659 --> 01:50:10.262]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.993 --> 01:50:18.038]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.438 --> 01:50:29.865]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.185 --> 01:50:33.728]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.148 --> 01:50:36.069]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.409 --> 01:50:40.252]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.386 --> 01:50:55.367]  Good morning, honey.
[01:50:55.727 --> 01:51:01.713]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[01:51:02.013 --> 01:51:02.613]  Yeah.

[01:51:08.639 --> 01:51:10.140]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:12.282]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:51:12.682 --> 01:51:14.464]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:51:14.664 --> 01:51:15.505]  Honey, cheer up.
[01:51:15.905 --> 01:51:18.167]  I brought our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[01:51:18.428 --> 01:51:18.748]  What?
[01:51:19.188 --> 01:51:29.678]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[01:51:29.958 --> 01:51:34.803]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?

[01:53:45.377 --> 01:53:47.039]  See, my pussy don't rule the world.
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:50.082]  You better get that in your head.
[01:53:50.102 --> 01:53:56.289]  This world is no found island, but I guess that's better left unsaid.
[01:54:15.916 --> 01:54:17.397]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:54:25.401 --> 01:54:29.303]  The latest is Terror Storm, the history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:54:29.843 --> 01:54:31.504]  A history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:54:32.704 --> 01:54:36.266]  From Hitler and the Reichstag right through the Gulf of Tonkin through 9-11-77.
[01:54:39.233 --> 01:54:41.694]  British Special Forces caught staging terror attacks.
[01:54:42.195 --> 01:54:43.255]  Red-handed in Iraq.
[01:54:43.295 --> 01:54:45.276]  Keep the ball rolling between the Sunnis and the Shia.
[01:54:47.257 --> 01:54:49.099]  It's a film you need to have.
[01:54:49.319 --> 01:54:50.219]  Terror Storm.

[01:55:33.743 --> 01:55:34.903]  It's been crazy lately.

[01:55:36.784 --> 01:55:42.205]  It'll be the third year anniversary of PrisonPlanet.tv in April.

[01:55:58.167 --> 01:56:00.028]  Let's talk to Kim in Texas.
[01:56:00.248 --> 01:56:01.669]  Welcome, my fellow Texan.
[01:56:02.449 --> 01:56:03.070]  Hey, Alex.
[01:56:03.710 --> 01:56:03.930]  Yes, ma'am.
[01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:07.852]  You were talking about the border patrols, teaching them to be cowards.
[01:56:08.452 --> 01:56:17.237]  Well, the Tennessee Reservists in Arizona, they're getting medals because they got down from the guard post and ran from the jerk smugglers.
[01:56:18.306 --> 01:56:18.947]  I saw that.
[01:56:19.027 --> 01:56:22.850]  No, it's just total and complete humiliation.
[01:56:23.630 --> 01:56:39.562]  And then a policeman, I don't know if they knew about this guy, Glenn Levy, he's on the Secretary of Commerce, and they were supposed to talk about SPP, and this guy did not get any definitive answers to anyone.
[01:56:40.083 --> 01:56:44.146]  So the commentator got so embarrassed, he asked, he said, well, are you going to discuss SPP?
[01:56:44.821 --> 01:56:49.366]  Any of the issues that the people are calling in about, because you said you're not answering the questions.
[01:56:49.386 --> 01:56:53.690]  I don't know if it was the setup, but they put the wrong guy on there.
[01:56:53.730 --> 01:56:56.653]  He kept saying the highways, we don't deal with the highways.
[01:56:57.213 --> 01:56:59.356]  Maybe you should go through transportation.
[01:56:59.376 --> 01:57:01.538]  No, no, you're looking at the very agency involved in it.
[01:57:01.738 --> 01:57:02.819]  No, they stonewalled.
[01:57:03.239 --> 01:57:04.300]  It's incredible to watch.
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:07.023]  They're running the thing, and they go, it doesn't exist.
[01:57:07.564 --> 01:57:07.764]  Yeah.
[01:57:09.176 --> 01:57:10.537]  I mean, just the lying.
[01:57:10.577 --> 01:57:11.497]  That's the thing, folks.
[01:57:11.597 --> 01:57:17.159]  Once you're really informed and have the facts, I mean, their own documents, then you see the very person that's involved in it lying.
[01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:20.060]  It's an eye-opener.
[01:57:20.301 --> 01:57:21.701]  It makes the light bulb go off.
[01:57:22.221 --> 01:57:23.082]  And that's the biggest thing.
[01:57:23.142 --> 01:57:24.602]  I hate seeing people get conned.
[01:57:25.143 --> 01:57:27.604]  I just can't believe the lies they get away with.
[01:57:27.844 --> 01:57:29.584]  But they're not getting away with them anymore.
[01:57:29.804 --> 01:57:31.145]  The sleeper is awakening.
[01:57:33.354 --> 01:57:37.978]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.018 --> 01:57:38.498]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.538 --> 01:57:39.459]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.499 --> 01:57:42.601]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:44.943 --> 01:57:48.085]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.090 --> 01:57:56.951]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.971 --> 01:58:01.274]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.835 --> 01:58:05.738]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:05.858 --> 01:58:11.783]  An amazing combat journalist is joining us, Dar Jamal, an American from right here in Texas.
[01:58:13.424 --> 01:58:14.985]  Talk about what's coming up with Iran.
[01:58:15.005 --> 01:58:16.747]  We need to focus on target Iran.
[01:58:17.267 --> 01:58:22.752]  What's happening right now with Lebanon descending into civil war, all by design, destabilization.
[01:58:23.405 --> 01:58:24.585]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:58:24.785 --> 01:58:27.766]  Rick in South Korea will go to you because you're on some IP phone.
[01:58:28.186 --> 01:58:29.206]  Go ahead, Rick.
[01:58:30.867 --> 01:58:31.627]  Hello, you hear me?
[01:58:32.187 --> 01:58:33.027]  Yes, I can hear you.
[01:58:33.087 --> 01:58:33.767]  Roger, Roger.
[01:58:33.787 --> 01:58:37.788]  All right, Alex, I just want to say thanks a lot for what you do.
[01:58:37.848 --> 01:58:39.468]  I've been listening to you for a while now.
[01:58:40.249 --> 01:58:43.209]  I've been telling everybody about your videos and my family and friends.
[01:58:44.309 --> 01:58:46.950]  But one thing I'd like your opinion on is this.
[01:58:48.690 --> 01:58:51.771]  If I own property within the United States, okay,
[01:58:52.628 --> 01:58:56.009]  And then I decided to give up my citizenship.
[01:58:56.649 --> 01:58:57.589]  I'm no longer a U.S.
[01:58:57.649 --> 01:58:58.109]  citizen.
[01:58:58.850 --> 01:59:00.870]  I still have a claim over that property, correct?
[01:59:01.450 --> 01:59:02.870]  Well, I don't want to give you legal advice.
[01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:03.711]  I don't know everything.
[01:59:03.731 --> 01:59:05.651]  I'm not the Carnac, the Magnificent.
[01:59:05.771 --> 01:59:09.992]  But, yes, I know foreigners can own U.S.
[01:59:10.032 --> 01:59:10.532]  property.
[01:59:13.593 --> 01:59:14.953]  You better check into that yourself.
[01:59:16.014 --> 01:59:21.015]  My point with that is that I think the focus on illegal immigration is...
[01:59:22.324 --> 01:59:31.774]  It's misguided because I don't think there is anything, any such thing as... Oh, even illegal aliens are allowed to own houses, but, you know, who knows?
[01:59:33.235 --> 01:59:35.918]  But when you focus on, like, America, the Republic...
[01:59:36.806 --> 01:59:41.390]  Why don't we try to focus now on telling people to give up their U.S.
[01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:44.892]  citizenships and start a new government, and start local government?
[01:59:45.073 --> 01:59:48.135]  But see, it isn't the country that went bad.
[01:59:48.195 --> 01:59:49.356]  It's people hijacked it.
[01:59:49.856 --> 01:59:51.217]  So giving up your U.S.
[01:59:51.297 --> 01:59:52.398]  I mean, do that if you want.
[01:59:52.438 --> 01:59:53.980]  You're a free person.
[01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:56.882]  But I'm not a revolutionary.
[01:59:56.922 --> 01:59:57.923]  I'm a restorationist.
[01:59:58.063 --> 01:59:59.144]  I want our country back.
[01:59:59.204 --> 01:59:59.904]  It's been taken.
[02:00:00.445 --> 02:00:01.786]  I want our Bill of Rights back.
[02:00:01.906 --> 02:00:02.746]  They're trying to take it.
[02:00:03.737 --> 02:00:04.378]  But that's what I mean.
[02:00:04.418 --> 02:00:07.240]  If we just stay as people, we're going to start a new Bill of Rights.
[02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:08.801]  We're going to start new communities.
[02:00:09.001 --> 02:00:14.946]  Well, that's what the Declaration of Independence... And start having local communities hook up and have our own constitution up.
[02:00:15.146 --> 02:00:17.107]  Well, that's what the Declaration of Independence says.
[02:00:19.950 --> 02:00:28.096]  But the thing is, like, the foundation of our government, I mean, there was so much with the slavery and the corporate elitists.
[02:00:28.576 --> 02:00:29.417]  Well, look, the U.S.
[02:00:29.477 --> 02:00:33.060]  isn't perfect, but compared to most nations, it's pretty darn good.
[02:00:34.377 --> 02:00:42.420]  But if we move away from them and start our own local government, wouldn't that be, we could start our own schools and get away from these public education schools?
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:43.920]  Yeah, but they'll send troops in.
[02:00:45.901 --> 02:00:49.182]  So we have to educate the troops, and it's a very complex issue.
[02:00:49.222 --> 02:00:52.083]  I appreciate your call from South Korea, I really do.
[02:00:52.723 --> 02:00:56.604]  Let's go ahead and talk to, who's up next here?
[02:00:57.364 --> 02:00:58.765]  Paul in Ohio, go ahead.
[02:00:58.785 --> 02:01:00.325]  Hello?
[02:01:00.625 --> 02:01:00.926]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:01.726 --> 02:01:02.186]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:06.812]  I hope you're all rested up for the marathon coming ahead here this year.
[02:01:06.832 --> 02:01:10.314]  Yeah, there's going to be a lot happening this year, I think.
[02:01:10.714 --> 02:01:16.057]  Yeah, it's going to be another gauntlet of their neocon psychos and the media shills again.
[02:01:16.077 --> 02:01:17.738]  I agree.
[02:01:18.139 --> 02:01:20.800]  Yeah, the thing I really wanted to bring up was this.
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:29.385]  It looks like this Iran thing, one of the big reasons, is it's going to precipitate this dollar collapse that they've been wanting to do for so long.
[02:01:30.089 --> 02:01:30.910]  I mean, they're right.
[02:01:30.970 --> 02:01:32.551]  They may not even have to attack.
[02:01:32.631 --> 02:01:42.697]  I mean, Lloyd's of London is saying they're going to declare the Gulf a war zone, and then no ships entering or leaving will be able to get insurance, so that means the end of the oil out of there.
[02:01:43.897 --> 02:01:47.559]  And, you know, countries like Japan, you know, they'll be out of oil in a month.
[02:01:47.739 --> 02:01:51.502]  And so, you know, that's what's really going to bring out a crash.
[02:01:51.562 --> 02:01:55.104]  The oil companies are going to absolutely love their profits.
[02:01:55.871 --> 02:01:59.918]  As they've been the last four years, we'll double even the previous records.
[02:02:01.881 --> 02:02:03.444]  The thing that's tipping me off to this...
[02:02:04.642 --> 02:02:07.705]  We're on the brink of a war, maybe a nuclear war.
[02:02:08.085 --> 02:02:12.408]  Why is the stock market going up and the price of oil is going down?
[02:02:12.468 --> 02:02:14.190]  It's totally non-ridiculous.
[02:02:14.210 --> 02:02:19.494]  Well, that's because they're manipulating the oil and they're manipulating the stock market and the dollar's been devalued.
[02:02:19.854 --> 02:02:24.178]  So you have almost three times more dollars chasing stock.
[02:02:24.198 --> 02:02:27.961]  So the stock market's really now below $6,000.
[02:02:28.561 --> 02:02:32.464]  But the Dow Jones Industrial 30 average is showing upwards of $12,000.
[02:02:34.557 --> 02:02:35.578]  It's total fraud, sir.
[02:02:35.598 --> 02:02:36.238]  Good to hear from you.
[02:02:36.258 --> 02:02:36.819]  Good points.
[02:02:37.339 --> 02:02:39.901]  Yeah, I mean, just... We're in the Matrix.
[02:02:42.844 --> 02:02:51.791]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.131 --> 02:02:54.073]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.453 --> 02:03:02.039]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.768 --> 02:03:09.833]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.214 --> 02:03:13.176]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:13.496 --> 02:03:15.878]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:16.298 --> 02:03:17.199]  NSA spying.
[02:03:17.599 --> 02:03:18.700]  Secret police torture.
[02:03:18.991 --> 02:03:21.632]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:03:21.952 --> 02:03:25.432]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.912 --> 02:03:27.793]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.173 --> 02:03:32.114]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:45.981 --> 02:04:50.424]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:04:50.865 --> 02:04:56.049]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[02:04:56.349 --> 02:04:59.552]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[02:04:59.812 --> 02:05:06.958]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[02:05:07.278 --> 02:05:14.464]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[02:05:14.884 --> 02:05:16.725]  We also do credit restoration.

[02:05:32.916 --> 02:05:33.296]  That's 920-293-8024.
[02:05:33.396 --> 02:05:34.357]  And ask for Robert.
[02:05:34.417 --> 02:05:36.939]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[02:05:46.366 --> 02:05:48.548]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.129 --> 02:05:51.971]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.011 --> 02:05:57.497]  We're going to continue with your calls.
[02:05:57.577 --> 02:06:02.202]  Kevin, Rob, Julius, and many others that are patiently holding.
[02:06:02.242 --> 02:06:04.564]  The toll-free number to join us in this final 52 minutes is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:09.378 --> 02:06:12.979]  I want to take some time out right now, because I don't do this often enough.
[02:06:12.999 --> 02:06:19.661]  I think about how thankful I am every 20 minutes, but I seem to not thank everybody enough in my own mind.
[02:06:19.681 --> 02:06:30.264]  I want to first off thank all the activists, all the truth lovers, all the people that have a desire to see justice done.
[02:06:30.985 --> 02:06:40.093]  All the people that I see as kindred spirits, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, European, Middle Eastern, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:40.994 --> 02:06:43.756]  My fellow Texans, my fellow Americans, everybody.
[02:06:45.477 --> 02:06:50.782]  I want to just say that my life has been wonderful.
[02:06:51.302 --> 02:06:54.105]  And I look forward to it being even better in this fight.
[02:06:54.145 --> 02:06:56.647]  And it has been such an incredible, humbling experience.
[02:06:57.555 --> 02:06:58.175]  We're good to go.
[02:06:58.195 --> 02:06:58.876]  We're good to go.
[02:07:22.023 --> 02:07:26.107]  And I'm thankful to our AM and FM affiliates, our shortwave affiliate, our internet affiliates.
[02:07:26.687 --> 02:07:27.888]  I'm thankful for my staff.
[02:07:29.149 --> 02:07:34.634]  I am thankful for all of you who've supported us, for the PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[02:07:35.755 --> 02:07:37.557]  I am thankful to our sponsors.
[02:07:38.698 --> 02:07:45.244]  I mean, heartfelt thank you for all you've done, because we are on the forefront of the fight against dehumanization.
[02:07:45.284 --> 02:07:48.907]  We are on the tip of the spear going in against this system.
[02:07:50.013 --> 02:07:51.614]  And we're making history together.
[02:07:51.834 --> 02:08:01.577]  And I want all of you to let it burn in and sink in just how serious this is and how we're on the edge of World War III that the global crime syndicate intends to push us into.
[02:08:01.977 --> 02:08:04.738]  And out of the chaos it creates, they intend to further consolidate.
[02:08:06.198 --> 02:08:18.182]  But if we're able to expose their true nature to enough of the people and able to expose their frauds and lies and discredit them and expose how they stage terror attacks, which is really their foundation to get us to rally around them when they indeed are the terrorists,
[02:08:18.903 --> 02:08:24.526]  We can really do a lot of good for humanity and this whole planet and future generations.
[02:08:24.626 --> 02:08:25.787]  But forget the future generations.
[02:08:26.287 --> 02:08:29.009]  Us today are children today and tomorrow.
[02:08:30.370 --> 02:08:34.192]  So redouble your efforts and ask God for guidance and commit yourself to this fight.
[02:08:34.672 --> 02:08:42.957]  Dar Jamal, of course, is a Christian Lebanese from Texas, American, and he's traveled to Iraq, Fallujah, during the combat.
[02:08:43.637 --> 02:08:44.558]  He was there before.
[02:08:45.941 --> 02:08:51.366]  In the south and in the central areas and in the north during the bombardments in Lebanon a few months ago.
[02:08:51.386 --> 02:08:54.048]  He is writing a book right now.
[02:08:54.909 --> 02:08:57.190]  He's got more courage than I do.
[02:08:57.210 --> 02:09:01.974]  And by courage, I would be afraid to go over there and get killed and not be able to continue my work.
[02:09:02.094 --> 02:09:04.116]  That's my fear, getting killed and not continuing the work.
[02:09:04.156 --> 02:09:12.903]  I actually, you know, you just have to not worry about your life when you do this stuff because it is somewhat dangerous when you're this prominent as Darja Mahal or myself and thousands of others.
[02:09:13.907 --> 02:09:15.990]  But he put it all on the line.
[02:09:16.030 --> 02:09:16.830]  It's one thing to talk about.
[02:09:16.850 --> 02:09:19.093]  It's another thing to do it to get the truth out.
[02:09:19.633 --> 02:09:23.077]  And Dar, we really appreciate you coming on with us today.
[02:09:23.746 --> 02:09:24.507]  My pleasure, Alex.
[02:09:24.567 --> 02:09:25.567]  Thanks a lot for having me.
[02:09:25.767 --> 02:09:35.734]  Well, I want to say I'm just honored to be able to consider myself your friend and honored to be able to associate with info warriors, real men like yourself.
[02:09:36.174 --> 02:09:50.684]  And we need to single out heroes like yourself, even though you don't want that, because heroes are people like you, Darjamal, who will go into hardcore combat zones peacefully with a notepad and a camera to cover the truth and
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:52.661]  Just amazing courage.
[02:09:52.721 --> 02:09:58.504]  It is not people that can put a basketball through a hoop or, you know, ride a bicycle up mountains.
[02:09:59.404 --> 02:10:01.445]  You, people like you are the heroes.
[02:10:01.485 --> 02:10:04.367]  And one thing the globalists have done is taken our real heroes.
[02:10:04.387 --> 02:10:07.449]  A hundred years ago, our heroes were combat journalists.
[02:10:07.689 --> 02:10:10.030]  Our heroes were inventors.
[02:10:10.150 --> 02:10:14.392]  Our heroes were firemen who went into buildings and got burned saving women and children.
[02:10:14.753 --> 02:10:16.313]  Our heroes were who they should have been.
[02:10:16.353 --> 02:10:18.815]  They were explorers and trailblazers.
[02:10:20.356 --> 02:10:23.138]  They were not Britney Spears.
[02:10:23.198 --> 02:10:27.721]  So, again, I want you to know, Dar, and I want to start singling out the heroes, that you are a hero.
[02:10:28.721 --> 02:10:30.062]  Well, thank you so much, Alex.
[02:10:30.102 --> 02:10:34.345]  You're really too kind, because like you said, we are certainly all in this together.
[02:10:35.822 --> 02:10:37.903]  Well, I think when people realize that it is life and death.
[02:10:37.963 --> 02:10:40.903]  I mean, these people funded Hitler, they funded Stalin, they funded Mao.
[02:10:40.923 --> 02:10:41.983]  They're not playing games.
[02:10:42.024 --> 02:10:42.804]  They're very evil.
[02:10:43.104 --> 02:10:44.004]  They're very cutthroat.
[02:10:44.024 --> 02:10:45.744]  They play everybody off against each other.
[02:10:46.144 --> 02:10:47.785]  It's just imperial divide and conquer.
[02:10:48.325 --> 02:10:49.005]  And so you're right.
[02:10:49.025 --> 02:10:52.226]  At the end of the day, we do what we do because we don't have a choice.
[02:10:52.986 --> 02:10:55.167]  But still, I want to commend you.
[02:10:55.187 --> 02:10:56.347]  Tell folks about your website.
[02:10:56.847 --> 02:11:00.548]  Yes, basically I have compiled the vast majority of all the work I've done about Iraq on a website.
[02:11:00.568 --> 02:11:03.228]  If folks just type in dar.org, they will be taken directly to the site where they can read.
[02:11:24.130 --> 02:11:25.750]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[02:11:43.848 --> 02:11:45.369]  And they're not just lining men up and killing them in ditches.
[02:11:45.549 --> 02:11:46.230]  It's whole families.
[02:11:46.270 --> 02:11:46.891]  It's a killing field.
[02:12:08.661 --> 02:12:15.607]  It is literally, and this is happening as we speak right now, still in cities like Haditha, Ramadi, Fallujah, Samarra.
[02:12:15.727 --> 02:12:19.471]  It is, as the Sunnis in Iraq are calling it, it is a genocide.
[02:12:21.712 --> 02:12:26.777]  Let's break down from your sources and what you've personally witnessed in Iraq and your trips there, what's really going on.
[02:12:28.109 --> 02:12:38.917]  Well, essentially the standard operating procedure, which I've been hearing now for several months now, is when these acts are carried out, basically the U.S.
[02:12:38.957 --> 02:12:42.760]  military has been setting up perimeters around primarily Sunni neighborhoods.
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:50.545]  For example, a neighborhood in Baghdad called Al-Adamiya, which has very fierce resistance there against the occupation.
[02:12:50.925 --> 02:12:51.626]  And so the U.S.
[02:12:51.666 --> 02:12:55.829]  forces have several times now gone in, encircled the entire neighborhood,
[02:12:56.369 --> 02:12:57.110]  We're good to go.
[02:13:18.863 --> 02:13:21.324]  Not just in this one neighborhood in Baghdad.
[02:13:21.344 --> 02:13:22.464]  This is just one example.
[02:13:22.504 --> 02:13:27.505]  But this is a similar tactic that's been used on Haifa Street very recently.
[02:13:27.545 --> 02:13:29.545]  We've seen this going off on the last few days.
[02:13:29.865 --> 02:13:34.866]  There was a video that's all over the Internet that just came out a couple of days ago showing U.S.
[02:13:34.926 --> 02:13:42.888]  soldiers cheering on Shia militia slash army members, all of the Iraqi security forces, roughly 85% of them,
[02:13:44.244 --> 02:13:50.627]  It is similar to what the Nazis did in the Balkans going in and hiring majority groups to persecute minority groups.
[02:14:07.978 --> 02:14:10.564]  Right, and that is exactly what's happened.
[02:14:11.045 --> 02:14:17.881]  You know, in the past, the U.S., as it was convenient to them, they supported Saddam Hussein and, of course,
[02:14:18.843 --> 02:14:28.906]  Him being a Sunni from Tikrit, it simply flaked out that his tribe, and being primarily Sunni, did get the majority support.
[02:14:28.946 --> 02:14:42.129]  Of course, they were the minority group at the time, but once Saddam Hussein started disobeying some of his orders from Washington, he was of course replaced with a Shia majority who was willing to play ball with America, at least for the time being.
[02:14:42.529 --> 02:14:58.597]  And so that's what's happening, and it is a replication of what you just said, where the majority group is being empowered back, given carte blanche much of the time by the United States and their military in Iraq, and we're seeing as a result of this one atrocity after another.
[02:14:59.707 --> 02:15:03.990]  But when you read our newspaper, it's Bush is real mad at the Shia leader.
[02:15:04.010 --> 02:15:10.053]  He's, boy, they're causing problems, those bad, evil Shia.
[02:15:10.454 --> 02:15:12.935]  Meanwhile, they're being given a red carpet.
[02:15:13.816 --> 02:15:22.221]  Right, and it's really propaganda, and I know that you're acutely aware of this and have been for a long time, but it really is just simply...
[02:15:22.882 --> 02:15:33.170]  propaganda that's been very effective in keeping the majority of people in the United States in the dark, as if the Iraqi government really has any kind of autonomy on its own.
[02:15:33.230 --> 02:15:40.736]  But basically what we have going on in Iraq, it's been described as an Islamic revolution with Pepsi.
[02:15:41.144 --> 02:15:53.146]  Where the Shia, who have come into power, have basically traded Iraq's... being willing to privatize Iraq's oil and trade huge chunks of Iraq's economy for political power.
[02:15:53.166 --> 02:15:54.767]  Just to be able to carry out vendettas.
[02:15:55.427 --> 02:15:57.867]  Exactly, and that's exactly what we're witnessing today.
[02:15:58.667 --> 02:16:02.788]  And the sociologists, they looked at it, the war planners, they knew exactly what would happen.
[02:16:02.828 --> 02:16:04.368]  It's the strategy of the global Balkans.
[02:16:05.109 --> 02:16:07.109]  And now we see things flaring up in Lebanon.
[02:16:08.618 --> 02:16:09.199]  That's right.
[02:16:09.539 --> 02:16:24.351]  Lebanon is kind of a wild card right now where Hezbollah, I think it is only a matter of time before they do successfully manage to topple this U.S.-backed, pro-Western government that's not representative of the vast majority of the people of that country.
[02:16:24.711 --> 02:16:32.134]  But why did Israel then invade, knowing that that would probably drive everybody to Hezbollah and cause their puppet government to fall?
[02:16:45.237 --> 02:17:06.036]  My opinion on that is that I think it's kind of this imperial hubris that has affected the US so much in Iraq, thinking that simply because they have the technology, they have carte blanche from the US, they have unlimited US backing and weapons and money and political support, that they could go in and basically do whatever they want.
[02:17:06.096 --> 02:17:10.460]  I think they legitimately believed a lot of their rhetoric, that they were going to be able to go in
[02:17:11.008 --> 02:17:13.271]  And now they think the same thing will happen in Iran.
[02:17:30.726 --> 02:17:31.527]  And of course it won't.
[02:17:31.627 --> 02:17:32.428]  Stay there, Darjamal.
[02:17:32.448 --> 02:17:34.530]  Let's talk about target Iran when we get back.
[02:17:34.851 --> 02:17:39.576]  Then we'll take your calls right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:39.976 --> 02:17:42.599]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[02:18:01.276 --> 02:18:04.278]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:18:04.598 --> 02:18:08.020]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.

[02:18:48.852 --> 02:18:51.753]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts No.
[02:18:52.013 --> 02:18:57.394]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:18:58.419 --> 02:19:03.321]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment?
[02:19:04.421 --> 02:19:06.222]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:19:06.622 --> 02:19:07.442]  There may be more.

[02:19:46.811 --> 02:19:49.695]  Ounce gold coins are 667.89, 335.58 for half, and 168.25 for quarter ounce.
[02:19:49.715 --> 02:19:50.296]  That's 667.89, 335.58, and 168.25.
[02:20:00.549 --> 02:20:02.391]  1971, Nixon closes the gold window.
[02:20:02.471 --> 02:20:03.291]  Fiat currency.
[02:20:04.072 --> 02:20:07.194]  1920s, the German mark explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[02:20:07.214 --> 02:20:10.056]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[02:20:10.796 --> 02:20:14.619]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[02:20:14.779 --> 02:20:16.760]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[02:20:17.641 --> 02:20:20.343]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[02:20:20.583 --> 02:20:25.727]  2006, the last superpower of the USA's mighty dollar loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[02:20:25.867 --> 02:20:27.148]  Could government let this happen?
[02:20:27.288 --> 02:20:29.229]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[02:20:29.469 --> 02:20:36.476]  Midas has Nick Bereshoff's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[02:20:36.516 --> 02:20:38.238]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[02:20:38.298 --> 02:20:39.559]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[02:20:39.599 --> 02:20:39.779]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:20:44.984 --> 02:20:46.105]  How are you feeling today?

[02:21:27.330 --> 02:21:30.771]  Find out why Mangosteen is known as the queen of all fruits
[02:21:31.031 --> 02:21:33.333]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:33.353 --> 02:21:34.594]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:55.985 --> 02:21:57.867]  We'll go straight to your phones in the next segment.
[02:21:57.947 --> 02:22:03.013]  Kevin, Rob, Julius, and others that are holding the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:03.033 --> 02:22:15.226]  Darja Mall, an American who's traveled the Middle East many times and covered it in combat situations from Fallujah to all over the country in what happened there in Lebanon last year.
[02:22:16.127 --> 02:22:16.628]  Iran.
[02:22:16.948 --> 02:22:21.392]  I mean, we've got the big head of the conservatives in Britain saying they may go ahead and attack.
[02:22:21.752 --> 02:22:23.014]  We've got the neocons saying it.
[02:22:23.034 --> 02:22:27.538]  We've got two task force there with another two carrier task force on top of it.
[02:22:27.558 --> 02:22:30.260]  So four task force total.
[02:22:30.341 --> 02:22:34.244]  Bush needs a new Ponzi scheme to kind of make us forget about the failure in Iraq.
[02:22:34.584 --> 02:22:35.986]  What do you see happening with Iran?
[02:22:37.668 --> 02:22:44.714]  I'm going to be very, very surprised if we don't see bombs start falling on Iran and not an invasion.
[02:22:44.774 --> 02:22:45.855]  I want to be clear about that.
[02:22:45.895 --> 02:22:49.818]  I think they are deluded enough to try to do it without troops.
[02:22:49.918 --> 02:23:00.386]  They're having the Pawnee Air Force generals telling them the same things that they did during Vietnam, that, no, we can just handle this with a large bombing campaign.
[02:23:00.446 --> 02:23:02.868]  No troops will be required, which is, of course, wrong.
[02:23:03.348 --> 02:23:06.391]  But I think if it does not start by the end of April...
[02:23:07.307 --> 02:23:07.987]  This April.
[02:23:08.167 --> 02:23:09.648]  I will be very, very surprised.
[02:23:10.828 --> 02:23:11.608]  And why is that?
[02:23:12.428 --> 02:23:21.110]  That's all of the chatter coming out of the Bush administration based on a lot of the reporting from Seymour Hersh and some of my sources as well.
[02:23:21.190 --> 02:23:24.871]  That's what I'm hearing from inside the administration.
[02:23:24.911 --> 02:23:30.492]  And then simply, and I think just as importantly, looking at what's coming out of Israel, I'd
[02:23:31.068 --> 02:23:37.054]  I imagine you've probably already reported on this, but very recently there was a conference over in an Israeli city.
[02:23:37.415 --> 02:23:44.482]  People like John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, John Edwards, various 2008 potential presidential candidates,
[02:23:47.020 --> 02:23:47.880]  Being vetted.
[02:23:48.280 --> 02:23:51.841]  Drumming up support for the war and preparing the people of Israel for what's coming.
[02:23:52.021 --> 02:24:03.564]  Meanwhile, we have Newt Gingrich saying ban free speech, saying that we're going to have a dictatorship, and these are quotes, folks, a dictatorial system, after nukes go off, saying Al-Qaeda, Al-Ciada will hit us.
[02:24:04.104 --> 02:24:08.005]  I really see the only way they'll get away with this is by staging some more terror attacks.
[02:24:08.065 --> 02:24:12.166]  Ray McGovern said that our government's clearly staging attacks in Iraq and other places.
[02:24:12.526 --> 02:24:16.307]  We know they've done it before in Iran, in Vietnam, and here in the U.S.,
[02:24:17.127 --> 02:24:18.508]  What about government-sponsored terror?
[02:24:18.568 --> 02:24:21.590]  Isn't that really the neocon's ace in the hole?
[02:24:21.610 --> 02:24:31.776]  Well, without a doubt, we have black ops being carried out in Iraq on a very regular basis, and have since the very, very beginning, during the invasion, actually.
[02:24:31.816 --> 02:24:34.118]  They had already started, if not even before.
[02:24:35.098 --> 02:24:39.021]  So I think it's certainly not out of the realm of possibility when we look at...
[02:24:40.089 --> 02:24:43.093]  Previously declassified documents from the CIA.
[02:24:43.153 --> 02:24:45.896]  This is what the CIA does.
[02:24:45.936 --> 02:24:47.639]  This is a big part of their program.
[02:24:47.659 --> 02:24:51.043]  This is why 40% of all Pentagon fundings
[02:24:51.616 --> 02:24:52.097]  And let's be clear.
[02:24:52.117 --> 02:24:52.637]  Oh, sorry, go ahead.
[02:24:52.657 --> 02:24:54.400]  There's going to have to be some...
[02:25:11.556 --> 02:25:17.018]  Well, they are with 78% of Americans, between 75% and 80%, depending on which poll, being totally against the current war and totally against expansion.
[02:25:36.265 --> 02:25:50.391]  Really, Dar, we're in a race to expose government-sponsored terror and expose who staged these wars so that they're so discredited their social engineers will trowel a balloon and test the water and tell them, look, you can't get away with it.
[02:25:50.811 --> 02:26:03.136]  But the policy makers take their orders from the big corporations and a lot of times they ignore what their tacticians and statisticians and sociologists and war planners and war mappers are telling them.
[02:26:03.556 --> 02:26:16.038]  So I think even if their experts tell them don't stage another terror attack or don't blow up a ship or don't have some provocation, that they're probably just going to go ahead and do it, unless we just have an incredible awakening.
[02:26:16.818 --> 02:26:24.900]  Well, I agree, and that's why I feel, unfortunately, feel quite confident that it is going to happen in just a matter of the next few months.
[02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:26.300]  It's not about logic.
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:27.540]  It's not about morals.
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:29.381]  It's not about doing the right thing, of course.
[02:26:29.401 --> 02:26:32.261]  It's certainly not about national security and all the other things
[02:26:32.586 --> 02:26:34.567]  A bogus propaganda they're spewing out.
[02:26:34.728 --> 02:26:40.231]  And again, I always caution people when I give talks about Iraq is don't use logic.
[02:26:40.491 --> 02:26:42.092]  Don't apply logic to these people.
[02:26:42.152 --> 02:26:43.373]  They are out of control.
[02:26:43.413 --> 02:26:45.955]  They're clearly not operating in reality.
[02:26:46.355 --> 02:26:47.016]  Well, hold on.
[02:26:47.456 --> 02:26:52.800]  And I agree with you, but to a certain point, don't apply regular decent person logic.
[02:26:52.900 --> 02:26:54.100]  Oh, we're trying to help the Iraqis.
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:54.941]  This doesn't make sense.
[02:26:55.401 --> 02:27:02.406]  If it's order out of chaos logic, create a big tar baby, which we're all forced to then escalate, then it makes perfect sense.
[02:27:03.186 --> 02:27:03.426]  Right.
[02:27:03.487 --> 02:27:04.327]  You're exactly right.
[02:27:04.427 --> 02:27:09.570]  I definitely agree with that, because it is part of their agenda to operate exactly in that fashion.
[02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:10.890]  Well, they say it is.
[02:27:10.970 --> 02:27:15.052]  It's not like you and I are looking into, gazing into crystal balls here.
[02:27:15.072 --> 02:27:16.953]  I mean, they say what they're going to do.
[02:27:16.973 --> 02:27:18.414]  That's correct.
[02:27:18.474 --> 02:27:20.095]  Yes, it's there for everyone to read.
[02:27:21.435 --> 02:27:27.659]  But they say one thing in a policy report, another thing on the State of the Union, so the people believe the State of the Union.
[02:27:27.919 --> 02:27:29.019]  That's the arrogance, folks.
[02:27:29.059 --> 02:27:30.500]  They openly have two sets of books.
[02:27:31.118 --> 02:27:32.959]  We're just reading the one they actually read off of.
[02:27:33.379 --> 02:27:35.039]  We'll be right back with Darjeel Mall, your calls.
[02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:36.920]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:39.021]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.941 --> 02:27:42.682]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.723 --> 02:27:48.104]  Attention, attention everyone.
[02:27:48.204 --> 02:27:50.664]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:27:50.724 --> 02:27:55.406]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.

[02:28:03.450 --> 02:28:16.314]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wrist Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[02:28:16.774 --> 02:28:20.756]  Wrist Ease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.

[02:28:25.017 --> 02:28:31.280]  And WristEase provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.

[02:28:35.062 --> 02:28:41.664]  That's WristEase, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, WristEase.com.
[02:28:41.845 --> 02:28:44.566]  Once again, WristEase.com.
[02:28:45.526 --> 02:28:51.549]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:28:51.569 --> 02:28:54.030]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big businesses
[02:28:59.309 --> 02:29:01.590]  The poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:32:04.951 --> 02:32:06.991]  You really think?
[02:32:07.011 --> 02:32:08.051]  Welcome back.
[02:32:08.151 --> 02:32:13.533]  Let's play the last part of this song.
[02:32:14.593 --> 02:32:15.233]  Never done that.
[02:32:17.434 --> 02:32:22.595]  My heroes have always lived their lives out on a limb.
[02:32:25.656 --> 02:32:28.096]  And I grew up thinking, I want to be like them.
[02:32:28.116 --> 02:32:29.737]  And when I die...
[02:32:38.467 --> 02:32:38.927]  Powerful words.
[02:32:38.947 --> 02:32:39.968]  Welcome back.
[02:32:39.988 --> 02:32:42.469]  We're going straight to your calls right now.
[02:33:09.298 --> 02:33:18.803]  InfoWars is proud to announce that I will be speaking at Austin's finest independent bookseller and Texas' biggest bookstore, Book People, on Sunday, January 28th from 8 to 10 p.m.
[02:33:18.823 --> 02:33:21.124]  That is this coming Sunday.
[02:33:21.144 --> 02:33:23.085]  It's the first day of next week.
[02:33:24.043 --> 02:33:27.785]  8 to 10 p.m., a special one-night free talk.
[02:33:28.185 --> 02:33:30.746]  I'll talk for like an hour and take questions for that hour.
[02:33:31.166 --> 02:33:33.847]  And then I'll sign DVDs of Terror Storm.
[02:33:33.887 --> 02:33:37.068]  You can bring your Terror Storm or you can get it signed there.
[02:33:37.088 --> 02:33:38.789]  I'll have some of my books and other things available.
[02:33:39.289 --> 02:33:44.151]  Be sure to get there early and grab an extra copy of the newest and most powerful film to date, Terror Storm.
[02:33:44.171 --> 02:33:49.553]  And I really look forward to seeing all of you out there.
[02:33:51.227 --> 02:34:04.103]  I hope that all of you will come out this Sunday at the corner of Lamar and 6th Street, right next to the biggest organic grocery store and restaurant in the U.S., the mothership, the headquarters of Whole Foods.
[02:34:04.664 --> 02:34:10.531]  So you can go eat dinner, you know, 7 to 8, and come on over, 6 to 8, lavish yourself, take time out.
[02:34:11.098 --> 02:34:15.060]  And then just come over and I'll give a speech, take questions, and sign Terror Storm.
[02:34:15.380 --> 02:34:16.540]  That is this Sunday night.
[02:34:16.560 --> 02:34:22.763]  I'll be on with George Norrie for two hours tonight in studio with him, coast-to-coast AM from News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[02:34:23.103 --> 02:34:25.684]  We'll also do a Sunday evening show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:34:25.724 --> 02:34:28.065]  Be sure and join us for that.
[02:34:29.385 --> 02:34:31.086]  All right, going back to Dar, Jamal.
[02:34:31.186 --> 02:34:33.867]  Dar, anything else you want to add on Iran before I start going to these calls?
[02:34:35.648 --> 02:34:36.931]  I think really we've covered it.
[02:34:36.992 --> 02:34:41.504]  I just want to underscore the urgency of the situation as you do a really good job of doing
[02:34:41.943 --> 02:34:43.744]  Oh, they're saying they're going to use nukes.
[02:34:43.764 --> 02:34:44.025]  Right, right.
[02:35:08.636 --> 02:35:13.100]  Yeah, I know I should eliminate the word potential because they've already outlined the plans.
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:14.642]  I mean, think about this, though.
[02:35:14.702 --> 02:35:21.127]  Cy Hersh a year and a half ago, now the White House has admitted they're considering, the Israelis are considering using a bunch of nukes on them.
[02:35:21.688 --> 02:35:22.529]  I mean, think about that.
[02:35:22.649 --> 02:35:29.775]  Nuking a country who's done nothing to us because they're nine years away and they were given all the materials they needed to accrue to A-bomb.
[02:35:30.716 --> 02:35:32.878]  I mean, when Israel's got 400 to 600 nukes and delivery systems...
[02:35:36.878 --> 02:35:39.000]  It's insane!
[02:35:40.381 --> 02:35:40.661]  It is.
[02:35:40.801 --> 02:35:56.752]  It's complete lunacy, and that's what people need to understand, that short of a wholesale enlightening and people getting activated very, very quickly to make some serious changes here at home to prevent this from happening, this is what's at stake.
[02:35:57.792 --> 02:35:58.173]  It is.
[02:35:58.373 --> 02:35:59.273]  It's what's at stake.
[02:36:00.700 --> 02:36:01.181]  I tell you.
[02:36:01.601 --> 02:36:03.604]  Let's go ahead and... We should also be praying, too.
[02:36:03.664 --> 02:36:05.947]  But even if they do attack Iran, more people are awake.
[02:36:06.348 --> 02:36:07.530]  More people will wake up to that.
[02:36:07.910 --> 02:36:09.753]  They're definitely going to try some domestic stuff.
[02:36:09.793 --> 02:36:15.781]  Newt Gingrich and Michael Savage and Limbaugh and Hannity have all been saying people need to be arrested who criticize the government.
[02:36:15.801 --> 02:36:17.203]  They're going to put us in camps.
[02:36:17.893 --> 02:36:25.617]  And at that point, there's going to be an insurgency against their insurgency, because they're the ones overthrowing America against their system.
[02:36:25.917 --> 02:36:28.259]  I mean, they may go for complete and total broke.
[02:36:28.279 --> 02:36:31.781]  They're announcing they're going to use microwave guns on the American people now.
[02:36:31.801 --> 02:36:32.821]  I'm sure you saw that, Dar.
[02:36:33.562 --> 02:36:34.702]  I have been following that.
[02:36:36.503 --> 02:36:37.564]  Folks, I'm not just saying that.
[02:36:37.604 --> 02:36:43.187]  They're openly talking about, well, I mean, Gingrich again said we're going to go into a dictatorship if there's another attack.
[02:36:45.197 --> 02:36:53.441]  That's what Tommy Franks, we now learn, when he was on the payroll for the two years after he left, remember he was running around giving those speeches, turned out he was on Pentagon payroll still to say that?
[02:36:53.841 --> 02:37:02.245]  Why does the Pentagon want you to hear, it's real sad to say, but it's what needs to happen, and the people are wanting it, there'll be martial law after another attack.
[02:37:02.705 --> 02:37:04.006]  I mean, how chilling is that, Dar?
[02:37:04.949 --> 02:37:08.010]  Well, all these weapons are already ready.
[02:37:08.070 --> 02:37:10.710]  Some have already been deployed and tested in Iraq.
[02:37:10.770 --> 02:37:16.091]  I've been following that story and trying to collect more information to do a news piece on it shortly as well.
[02:37:16.191 --> 02:37:18.832]  And this is just shade of things to come here.
[02:37:18.912 --> 02:37:25.493]  It's without a doubt they are testing out these weapons, have been using them in Iraq, and of course they will be used domestically.
[02:37:26.413 --> 02:37:29.854]  Oh, the head of the Air Force, the Air Force Secretary, said it to the Houston Chronicle.
[02:37:30.794 --> 02:37:35.535]  He said, we need to use this first in the American people, because then the world will accept us using it on foreign enemies.
[02:37:37.716 --> 02:37:40.576]  Do you ever feel like you're living in a Twilight Zone episode, Dar Jamal?
[02:37:41.097 --> 02:37:42.677]  Without a doubt.
[02:37:43.217 --> 02:37:45.478]  Without a doubt, living inside of the Matrix.
[02:37:46.338 --> 02:37:46.658]  Yeah.
[02:37:47.138 --> 02:37:47.978]  Let's take some calls.
[02:37:48.018 --> 02:37:49.159]  Give out your website one more time.
[02:37:50.059 --> 02:37:54.900]  It's simply dar.org, D-A-H-R, my first name, dot org.
[02:37:56.471 --> 02:38:01.655]  I used to have a longer one, but I guess... Well, that will take you to the longer one.
[02:38:01.695 --> 02:38:03.756]  We're just trying to... No, that makes sense.
[02:38:04.677 --> 02:38:04.897]  Yeah.
[02:38:04.937 --> 02:38:05.798]  Dar.com is excellent.
[02:38:06.738 --> 02:38:08.520]  Let's... We've got so many calls here.
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:09.360]  Who's up first here?
[02:38:11.482 --> 02:38:12.562]  Kevin in Boston.
[02:38:12.602 --> 02:38:13.383]  You're on the air.
[02:38:13.443 --> 02:38:13.803]  Welcome.
[02:38:14.464 --> 02:38:14.844]  Thank you.
[02:38:15.064 --> 02:38:22.369]  It's an honor to be on the show with the last of a dying breed, yourself and Dar Jamal, and true independent journalists.
[02:38:22.790 --> 02:38:26.052]  I agree with your caller that was on about the MySpace earlier.
[02:38:26.873 --> 02:38:27.834]  About Ron Paul.
[02:38:27.874 --> 02:38:35.242]  You know, Patriot people are people that are passionate about all issues and especially anything to do with their rights.
[02:38:35.322 --> 02:38:39.306]  But the one thing that unites people is Ron Paul.
[02:38:39.346 --> 02:38:46.293]  His integrity has me switching from being a registered Democrat to the Republican Party so I can vote for him in the primaries.
[02:38:46.393 --> 02:38:46.653]  Great.
[02:38:49.512 --> 02:39:07.406]  I'm a Catholic and I thought looking back at having Hutton Gibson on as a great guest the other day and what he had to say about the church was very insightful for myself and I thought it was great to answer those critics that are trying to say that you're afraid to touch any issue.
[02:39:08.107 --> 02:39:08.567]  You're not.
[02:39:10.048 --> 02:39:10.869]  All the negativity.
[02:39:11.109 --> 02:39:13.231]  I had called in right before you went on vacation and
[02:39:13.641 --> 02:39:21.324]  And you would give me a clue to, you know, looking for disinfo, just look for the people who have nothing positive to offer but are attacking other patriots everywhere.
[02:39:21.364 --> 02:39:28.608]  And I feel like in that movie where they get the glasses where you can see, it really, that was a very insightful comment that you made.
[02:39:29.108 --> 02:39:38.532]  And I was wondering, when I listened to you right before you went on vacation, I didn't know exactly, you know, I knew the type of people you were talking about, but I didn't know what was going on.
[02:39:38.552 --> 02:39:42.334]  And I was wondering if you could tell me where I can look to see
[02:39:43.257 --> 02:39:47.919]  You were addressing some specific individuals without naming them.
[02:39:47.999 --> 02:39:50.941]  I appreciate your call.
[02:39:50.961 --> 02:40:01.746]  A horrible individual that moved down to the central Texas area to set up his own counterfeit or whatever you want of patriot movement.
[02:40:02.871 --> 02:40:04.892]  I guess you could call it patriot movement, whatever.
[02:40:04.913 --> 02:40:15.379]  It just said just an incredible lie about me that had to be responded to, but I only wanted to say it for those that knew who I was talking about instead of giving the person listeners, and I appreciate your call.
[02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:19.482]  And it was just unbelievably despicable, and I am going to do something about it.
[02:40:19.542 --> 02:40:20.923]  I am doing something about it right now.
[02:40:21.963 --> 02:40:26.807]  Let's go ahead and go to Julius in Arizona.
[02:40:26.827 --> 02:40:27.407]  Thank you for holding.
[02:40:27.447 --> 02:40:27.947]  You're a trooper.
[02:40:27.967 --> 02:40:29.088]  You're on the air with Darjamal.
[02:40:29.748 --> 02:40:30.889]  You got that right, Alex.
[02:40:30.989 --> 02:40:31.510]  How are you?
[02:40:31.730 --> 02:40:32.030]  Good, sir.
[02:40:32.857 --> 02:40:35.278]  I honor you both for the hard work that you do.
[02:40:35.738 --> 02:40:38.499]  And I am a supporter of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:40:39.540 --> 02:40:48.283]  I find it very useful to be able to download something and then put it on the micro here in southern Arizona or to share it with people by CD.
[02:40:48.603 --> 02:40:50.344]  Oh, great, with your micro FM station.
[02:40:51.404 --> 02:40:53.225]  Yeah, a pretty small one, but yeah.
[02:40:53.245 --> 02:40:54.185]  Very effective.
[02:40:54.225 --> 02:40:57.206]  I mean, people put little one-waters in their houses and they go a mile.
[02:40:57.266 --> 02:40:59.047]  You put a 10-water in, they go 5 miles.
[02:40:59.067 --> 02:41:00.908]  You put a 100-water in, it goes 30 miles.
[02:41:00.988 --> 02:41:01.968]  It's just so effective.
[02:41:02.645 --> 02:41:02.865]  Sure.
[02:41:03.345 --> 02:41:10.788]  And I have an activist page for people who want to explore building their own antenna and getting started in low-power FM.
[02:41:10.868 --> 02:41:12.728]  It's simmeringfrogs.net.
[02:41:12.988 --> 02:41:15.249]  Oh, yeah, you've called about that, simmeringfrogs.net.
[02:41:15.989 --> 02:41:21.791]  Yeah, and I've got other stuff on .com, but the LPFM self-help page is simmeringfrogs.net.
[02:41:22.131 --> 02:41:22.831]  Fantastic.
[02:41:23.892 --> 02:41:27.653]  One little word of correction from the other day, if I may offer some insight.
[02:41:28.588 --> 02:41:31.090]  There used to be a book written by Tom Redden.
[02:41:31.330 --> 02:41:32.550]  I think that was his first name.
[02:41:32.590 --> 02:41:34.932]  He used to be chief of police of the LAPD.
[02:41:36.212 --> 02:41:41.835]  And he had an aspiring young buck pushing hard to get up to the top of the food chain by the name of Gates.
[02:41:42.776 --> 02:41:44.977]  Yeah, it was Darryl Gates that set up the SWAT teams.
[02:41:44.997 --> 02:41:46.538]  They were special weapons attack teams.
[02:41:47.378 --> 02:41:48.679]  Well, he was chief of police.
[02:41:48.739 --> 02:41:54.102]  Darryl Gates was chief of police of the LAPD one or two terms after Tom Redden left.
[02:41:54.202 --> 02:41:54.802]  No, I understand.
[02:41:54.822 --> 02:41:57.784]  Yeah, and he was not a general.
[02:41:59.771 --> 02:42:01.793]  At the time, he proposed this concept.
[02:42:01.813 --> 02:42:03.294]  You must have misunderstood me, sir.
[02:42:03.374 --> 02:42:06.117]  I said that the military came in and advised them.
[02:42:06.977 --> 02:42:07.338]  Oh, no.
[02:42:08.138 --> 02:42:08.979]  Don't get me wrong here.
[02:42:09.019 --> 02:42:12.402]  I got family that was there at the time in the organization.
[02:42:14.224 --> 02:42:24.593]  What he suggested to, it was either Redden or possibly Chief Parker who preceded Redden, the concept name was Special Weapons and Terrorism.
[02:42:25.973 --> 02:42:32.755]  That was the original concept that was floated by this young buck that was, you know, young and dumb and full of too much hormones, as we say.
[02:42:33.035 --> 02:42:34.315]  Well, let me break that down.
[02:42:34.355 --> 02:42:38.156]  The reason I say special weapons attack teams, I saw him in a PBS special.
[02:42:38.597 --> 02:42:48.819]  It was Laird Neusauer about militarization of police in like 1987, 1997, excuse me, saying we wanted to call it special weapons attack teams, but they said that was too mean.
[02:42:49.180 --> 02:42:50.100]  So that's where I get that.
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:52.140]  He tried to soften reality.
[02:42:52.180 --> 02:42:54.001]  If you read Tom Redden's paperback,
[02:42:54.557 --> 02:43:00.420]  The original goofball name of this insane concept was Special Weapons and Terrorism.
[02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:11.145]  And anybody with half a brain could see through it that, especially in the 70s, that wasn't something that was going to fly with the American people or the average person living in Los Angeles.
[02:43:11.826 --> 02:43:14.909]  You'd have to be on LSD to even consider such a concept.
[02:43:15.149 --> 02:43:15.789]  Awesome call.
[02:43:15.849 --> 02:43:16.170]  Thank you.
[02:43:16.210 --> 02:43:16.890]  Let me bring that up.
[02:43:16.930 --> 02:43:20.593]  BBC's reporting they're not just getting helicopters and armored vehicles and tanks.
[02:43:20.633 --> 02:43:24.016]  Now they're getting rocket launchers, attack helicopters.
[02:43:24.456 --> 02:43:30.321]  They've federalized our police and the same type of management system and checkpoints they're setting up in Iraq.
[02:43:30.341 --> 02:43:32.142]  I saw this in MIT Magazine last year.
[02:43:32.162 --> 02:43:37.066]  This whole camera grid is a Pentagon-designed model from MIT.
[02:43:37.086 --> 02:43:37.727]  Did you know that, Dar?
[02:43:38.476 --> 02:43:49.139]  Well, that, coupled with all of the information sharing between all the Pentagon, the police force, all of it is deeply, deeply disturbing.
[02:43:49.339 --> 02:43:50.720]  The national ID card?
[02:43:50.740 --> 02:43:50.940]  Yeah.
[02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:53.160]  Yeah, again, it's not serious.
[02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:54.441]  It's exactly happening.
[02:43:54.501 --> 02:43:57.362]  It's already well, well underway, actually, in fact.
[02:43:57.462 --> 02:44:01.023]  And next time, you know, something like this, something like a 9-11 happens,
[02:44:02.716 --> 02:44:07.159]  In the U.S., without a doubt, we're going to see firsthand what they've been up to for the last six years.
[02:44:07.599 --> 02:44:11.961]  Oh, and before that, they have been since the 80s with Rex 84 laying the groundwork.
[02:44:12.001 --> 02:44:15.363]  I mean, they've been working like busy bees, and they're not doing it for nothing.
[02:44:15.923 --> 02:44:19.765]  This is the military, controlled by the big banks and corporations, deciding to take over the country.
[02:44:19.785 --> 02:44:21.226]  That's what always happened in other nations.
[02:44:21.726 --> 02:44:27.389]  It's just they know America's big and bad, so they've been very crafty, very... It's so sick.
[02:44:27.989 --> 02:44:30.330]  Just slowly, it's like a slow-motion coup.
[02:44:30.390 --> 02:44:31.251]  Is that a good term, Darke?
[02:44:32.177 --> 02:44:33.159]  I think it really is.
[02:44:33.179 --> 02:44:43.454]  It really is kind of a slow burn method of how they're doing it, of how they're preparing the economy for total collapse, of how the country is bankrupt.
[02:44:43.474 --> 02:44:44.916]  There's no question about that.
[02:44:44.996 --> 02:44:46.939]  It's only a matter of time before the bottom...
[02:44:47.415 --> 02:44:48.695]  It's quite effective.
[02:45:07.623 --> 02:45:08.063]  It is.
[02:45:08.263 --> 02:45:13.587]  And then after they're done, because we're owned by the big European banks predominantly, they'll use us to take over countries, dominate.
[02:45:13.607 --> 02:45:15.688]  Then we get blamed like the old Soviet Union.
[02:45:16.108 --> 02:45:18.029]  Then we kind of fall into third world-dom.
[02:45:18.290 --> 02:45:20.871]  And then meanwhile, the big corporations have had the U.S.
[02:45:20.891 --> 02:45:22.132]  hand them all the assets.
[02:45:23.213 --> 02:45:23.753]  It's sick.
[02:45:23.893 --> 02:45:24.693]  It's so sick.
[02:45:25.414 --> 02:45:26.595]  And all these flag wavers.
[02:45:26.635 --> 02:45:29.116]  If you really love America, you need to wake up.
[02:45:29.196 --> 02:45:32.558]  Waving a Chinese desecrated American flag made by slaves is not it.
[02:45:33.279 --> 02:45:34.940]  Let's talk to Greg.
[02:45:36.160 --> 02:45:37.141]  Greg's up next, right?
[02:45:38.442 --> 02:45:39.323]  Okay, Gary's next.
[02:45:39.423 --> 02:45:40.244]  Gary in Maine.
[02:45:40.264 --> 02:45:40.925]  Go ahead, Gary.
[02:45:41.225 --> 02:45:41.705]  Hi, Alex.
[02:45:42.066 --> 02:45:45.209]  I'd like to say something about we have a little victory.
[02:45:45.349 --> 02:45:46.850]  Maine rejects Real ID Act.
[02:45:47.050 --> 02:45:47.831]  Yes, I have that.
[02:45:47.911 --> 02:45:49.193]  Maine is kicking it out.
[02:45:49.213 --> 02:45:50.774]  A couple other states are doing it.
[02:45:50.814 --> 02:45:51.595]  I have it in the AP.
[02:45:51.955 --> 02:46:00.824]  Maine lawmakers on Thursday became the first in the nation to demand repeal of a federal law tightening identification requirements for driver's license and post-September 11 security measure.
[02:46:01.144 --> 02:46:02.365]  That's the national ID card.
[02:46:02.906 --> 02:46:03.006]  Yeah.
[02:46:04.463 --> 02:46:04.823]  Okay.
[02:46:05.043 --> 02:46:06.764]  That's all I need to tell you.
[02:46:07.104 --> 02:46:07.465]  Thank you.
[02:46:07.545 --> 02:46:08.585]  I mentioned it in the first hour.
[02:46:08.625 --> 02:46:09.766]  I should have spent more time on it.
[02:46:10.406 --> 02:46:12.067]  There are exciting things happening, Dar.
[02:46:12.107 --> 02:46:13.167]  People really are waking up.
[02:46:13.207 --> 02:46:13.888]  That's what I'm seeing.
[02:46:13.928 --> 02:46:14.528]  Are you seeing that?
[02:46:15.148 --> 02:46:16.349]  I am, without a doubt.
[02:46:16.609 --> 02:46:23.512]  When I give presentations about Iraq, it's such horribly depressing information, and people inevitably ask, what can we do?
[02:46:23.532 --> 02:46:25.053]  This is so horrible.
[02:46:25.073 --> 02:46:25.974]  We've already lost.
[02:46:26.034 --> 02:46:26.774]  And I say, no.
[02:46:27.174 --> 02:46:32.657]  Despite the billions of dollars this government and corporations are pouring into keeping people safe,
[02:46:33.437 --> 02:46:34.078]  I think so.
[02:46:54.884 --> 02:47:03.867]  So I think there is hope, and I think more people than ever understand what is happening today, and on that level, we're winning.
[02:47:04.567 --> 02:47:06.067]  And people can feel the evil.
[02:47:06.127 --> 02:47:07.748]  I mean, people know something's wrong.
[02:47:07.768 --> 02:47:09.448]  The media tries to go, oh, it's terrorism.
[02:47:09.749 --> 02:47:12.169]  No, no, no, that deep-down feeling is you know what's in the government.
[02:47:12.489 --> 02:47:14.050]  Travis in Texas, thanks for holding.
[02:47:14.070 --> 02:47:14.650]  You're on the air.
[02:47:14.910 --> 02:47:19.451]  Hey, Alex, I want to give you a compliment, first of all, and what you're doing.
[02:47:20.112 --> 02:47:24.453]  First of all, you can't change the world, but you can change the minds of people.
[02:47:24.946 --> 02:47:26.046]  And that's what you're trying to do.
[02:47:26.066 --> 02:47:27.307]  It's like the matrix.
[02:47:27.567 --> 02:47:29.268]  And by doing that, you do change the world.
[02:47:29.348 --> 02:47:29.828]  Exactly.
[02:47:30.148 --> 02:47:32.629]  And just like the matrix, there is no spoon.
[02:47:32.689 --> 02:47:34.049]  You can't bend the spoon.
[02:47:34.109 --> 02:47:35.430]  You can only change yourself.
[02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:37.170]  Now, I want to read something.
[02:47:37.190 --> 02:47:40.111]  This is about tax, tax laws and income tax.
[02:47:41.412 --> 02:47:45.793]  I've got something here that says, Labor of human being is not a commodity for an article of commerce.
[02:47:46.393 --> 02:47:46.694]  Okay?
[02:47:47.134 --> 02:47:48.254]  That's the commerce and trade.
[02:47:48.294 --> 02:47:50.875]  That's basically saying human beings' labor cannot be taxed.
[02:47:51.658 --> 02:47:52.579]  Okay, now it goes on.
[02:47:52.879 --> 02:47:54.600]  I go on with other definitions.
[02:47:54.900 --> 02:47:55.761]  Citizen defined.
[02:47:56.241 --> 02:48:01.905]  It's a person or a person having an interest which is or may be adversely effective.
[02:48:02.065 --> 02:48:02.705]  I keep going.
[02:48:03.185 --> 02:48:09.049]  Person, human being, child, and individual as including born alive infant.
[02:48:10.030 --> 02:48:13.552]  Again, the term individual means a citizen of the United States.
[02:48:14.204 --> 02:48:16.885]  Or an alien lawfully admitted or permitted resident.
[02:48:17.105 --> 02:48:18.986]  Well, boil it down for us, the nomenclature.
[02:48:19.006 --> 02:48:19.486]  What are you saying?
[02:48:20.026 --> 02:48:20.726]  Here's what's going on.
[02:48:21.146 --> 02:48:22.907]  The United States means a federal corporation.
[02:48:24.087 --> 02:48:27.328]  We are all have interest in the federal corporation.
[02:48:27.368 --> 02:48:27.549]  No, I know.
[02:48:27.569 --> 02:48:34.831]  The Federal Reserve System in the 1933 Marshall Law bankruptcy put us into a false system.
[02:48:34.871 --> 02:48:35.611]  It is the Matrix.
[02:48:35.691 --> 02:48:37.312]  Briefly, you can finish up on the other side.
[02:48:37.632 --> 02:48:39.913]  And I want to give Dar a few moments to have closing comments.
[02:48:40.693 --> 02:48:42.874]  The final segment straight ahead.
[02:48:43.034 --> 02:48:43.514]  Stay with us.
[02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:52.121]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.461 --> 02:48:54.401]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.761 --> 02:49:02.443]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.103 --> 02:49:10.164]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.565 --> 02:49:13.505]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:49:13.845 --> 02:49:16.206]  The White House probed to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:16.626 --> 02:49:17.446]  NSA spies.
[02:49:17.938 --> 02:49:21.981]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.281 --> 02:49:25.844]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.264 --> 02:49:28.145]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.505 --> 02:49:32.448]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:03.136 --> 02:52:04.478]  All our times have come.
[02:52:08.086 --> 02:52:09.148]  Forever gone.
[02:52:11.574 --> 02:52:12.876]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:14.708 --> 02:52:17.909]  I'll be at Book People, downtown Austin, 6th and Lamar.
[02:52:17.969 --> 02:52:20.209]  Plenty of free parking there at the downtown parking garage.
[02:52:20.789 --> 02:52:23.570]  Right next door there at Whole Foods, all part of the same complex.
[02:52:23.950 --> 02:52:24.950]  I'll be speaking 8 to 10.
[02:52:25.370 --> 02:52:28.971]  I'll speak for an hour, take questions, and sign Terror Storm DVDs.
[02:52:29.751 --> 02:52:30.291]  Come all.
[02:52:30.391 --> 02:52:32.392]  Come young, come old, come black, come white.
[02:52:33.052 --> 02:52:35.152]  I hope to meet you and shake your hand.
[02:52:35.192 --> 02:52:38.193]  That's this Sunday night, and that's 8 to 10 p.m.
[02:52:40.032 --> 02:52:44.576]  In downtown Austin, details at infowars.com, the address and all the rest of it.
[02:52:45.616 --> 02:52:56.345]  Real fast, because, Travis, I know it's a private corporation, I know it's a fraud, I know it's a parallel shadow government, and I know there's all these sciences for recusing yourself out of it.
[02:52:57.245 --> 02:52:57.906]  They don't care.
[02:52:58.026 --> 02:53:04.231]  It's just thuggism and criminality, and in my experience, which has been long and lengthy and deep,
[02:53:05.130 --> 02:53:07.871]  At the end of the day, it's just armored thuggism.
[02:53:08.191 --> 02:53:09.232]  It's law of the jungle.
[02:53:09.292 --> 02:53:10.892]  But go ahead and finish up what you were saying.
[02:53:11.332 --> 02:53:18.015]  Well, basically what I was getting at is how they taxed us is what they've done is created this federal corporation that's a limited liability corporation.
[02:53:18.175 --> 02:53:20.676]  And what they did was put liability on all their citizens.
[02:53:21.603 --> 02:53:27.147]  Yeah, they say we owe the national debt and all this when they own the banks that issue the debt and it's all a fraud.
[02:53:27.347 --> 02:53:28.388]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:53:28.408 --> 02:53:35.793]  And I just wanted to bring that up, and that's basically how they've said, okay, you owe us taxes because you're part of this limited liability corporation.
[02:53:36.013 --> 02:53:38.574]  Yeah, before governments tax goods coming in or other key things.
[02:53:38.594 --> 02:53:39.195]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:39.635 --> 02:53:42.297]  Darja Mall, in closing, any other key comments you'd like to make, sir?
[02:53:43.404 --> 02:53:48.226]  I would just, at the risk of being redundant, underscore the urgency of this situation.
[02:53:48.466 --> 02:53:58.369]  If anyone is thinking about getting more involved or taking some greater risks and trying to affect some positive change here, we can try to take back control of this country.
[02:53:58.750 --> 02:53:59.630]  Now is the time.
[02:53:59.690 --> 02:54:03.951]  There is absolutely no justification for waiting any longer than right now.
[02:54:05.752 --> 02:54:07.153]  And we'll be watching your reports.
[02:54:07.213 --> 02:54:07.813]  Is it DAR.com?
[02:54:09.227 --> 02:54:10.089]  DAR.org.
[02:54:10.189 --> 02:54:11.572]  DAR.org.
[02:54:12.032 --> 02:54:14.197]  I've got the old site, so I'll keep having that in my mind.
[02:54:15.074 --> 02:54:21.416]  Well, listen, dar.org, I know we have a link to it up on infowars.com, and as this develops, I hope to have you back on.
[02:54:21.456 --> 02:54:22.696]  How's your book coming, your writing?
[02:54:23.457 --> 02:54:25.997]  Finishing it up now, doing final edits.
[02:54:26.097 --> 02:54:28.398]  It will be coming out later on this summer.
[02:54:28.578 --> 02:54:38.441]  Well, I'd like to launch it on my show, you know, amongst other shows, and I'd like to get an advanced copy and carry it in our online video and bookstore at infowars.com, Dar.
[02:54:39.022 --> 02:54:41.182]  I will definitely be in touch with you about that, Alex.
[02:54:41.322 --> 02:54:42.423]  God bless you and take care.
[02:54:42.863 --> 02:54:43.603]  Thanks, likewise.
[02:54:44.321 --> 02:54:47.764]  There goes Dar Jamal, Christian Lebanese American from Houston, Texas.
[02:54:47.804 --> 02:54:50.347]  Went over to Lebanon, been over to Iraq, Fallujah many times.
[02:54:50.407 --> 02:54:51.067]  A lot of bravery.
[02:54:51.107 --> 02:54:51.888]  We commend him.
[02:54:51.928 --> 02:54:53.229]  I'm sorry to Eric and others.
[02:54:53.249 --> 02:54:54.431]  We don't have time to get to your calls.
[02:54:54.811 --> 02:54:59.976]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, on the network and the satellites and on many other stations that tape the latest.
[02:55:00.656 --> 02:55:03.460]  And you can always listen on the internet at Infowars.com.

[02:55:58.307 --> 02:56:07.391]  And I kind of want to steal today what Jack McClam always says here weeknights on Genesis at 7 o'clock Central.
[02:56:07.952 --> 02:56:11.973]  Don't forget, this old cop truly loves you, America.
[02:56:12.274 --> 02:56:13.034]  I truly do.
[02:56:13.094 --> 02:56:19.357]  Well, don't forget, this young crazy Texan surely does love you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:56:20.103 --> 02:56:20.924]  I truly do.
[02:56:21.285 --> 02:56:21.705]  Take care.
