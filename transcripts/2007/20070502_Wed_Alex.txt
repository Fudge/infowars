[00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:06.374]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.034 --> 00:00:08.074]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.795 --> 00:00:09.935]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:11.376]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:13.096]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:17.358]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:21.959]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:36.639]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:37.119]  Welcome.
[00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:44.187]  It is Wednesday, the fifth month of this year, already busted wide open, the second day of May 2007.
[00:00:44.287 --> 00:00:48.311]  And we'll be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.198 --> 00:00:52.700]  We'll be welcoming St.
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:08.560]  John Hunt, the son of former CIA agent Black Ops Commander and Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt to discuss his father's recent deathbed confession of his involvement in the JFK assassination operation.
[00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:11.430]  That's in the third hour.
[00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:22.675]  In the second hour, we're going to be joined by former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Reagan, and former Associate Editor of the Wall Street Journal, Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:36.282]  Dr. Roberts, the former... He'll be discussing the former CIA Director George Tenet, and other neocon rats who are now rapidly leaving the sinking ship.
[00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:49.400]  And Rupert Murdoch's $5 billion rebuff, but that doesn't mean it's over, bid to buy Dow Jones, the owner of the Wall Street Journal and of course the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.562]  The Pentagon really wants full control of that.
[00:01:53.003 --> 00:02:00.509]  Now, the Pentagon manipulates it through its private shareholders in the defense contractors Big Oil and Central Banking.
[00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.092]  But to actually have a CIA company
[00:02:04.756 --> 00:02:05.957]  Physically holding it.
[00:02:06.777 --> 00:02:08.258]  That's what News Corp is, of course.
[00:02:08.518 --> 00:02:09.379]  I see CIA.
[00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.559]  It's really British intel.
[00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:16.663]  A lot of evidence shows Rupert Murdoch, like everybody else, Tony Blair, Bill Clinton, was brought into British intelligence.
[00:02:16.723 --> 00:02:20.605]  And then that's the same thing as the CIA when he was there at Oxford.
[00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:22.987]  And then it went on from there.
[00:02:23.687 --> 00:02:25.808]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:31.411]  We'll be going over all of this coming up with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:02:31.532 --> 00:02:32.052]  A real
[00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:35.626]  Conservative in the next hour.
[00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:41.691]  He'll just be with us for 30 minutes and then we'll be taking your calls in the second half of that hour.
[00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:42.972]  We'll also have open phones.
[00:02:43.012 --> 00:02:45.774]  I want to do it again today because I meant to take a lot of calls yesterday.
[00:02:45.794 --> 00:02:48.777]  I did take 10 or 15 but not as many as I wanted to because I was so busy covering news.
[00:02:49.157 --> 00:03:01.407]  I do want to have first-time calls on geopolitical news, the ongoing slide of the dollar that's really gone little noticed, the BBC reporting that three days ago they had the gigantic
[00:03:03.153 --> 00:03:07.175]  Summit, European, EU, American Union Summit in D.C.
[00:03:07.215 --> 00:03:11.157]  and agreed to fully integrate the nation's huge news.
[00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:17.060]  We should have a report out on that in the next few days at PrisonPlanet.com and at FourWars.com.
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.021]  I'd love to hear from you on that subject.
[00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:24.183]  The Kennedy assassination now admitted to be a government operation.
[00:03:24.764 --> 00:03:26.284]  The toll-free number to join us, 1-800
[00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.010]  259-9231-1800.
[00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.050]  259-9231.
[00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:39.498]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[00:03:42.261 --> 00:03:54.432]  Before I end this segment and come back and plunge into the news, I would like to remind all the listeners that we have a free podcast every day of the full three hours that serves out between two and three o'clock.
[00:03:55.191 --> 00:03:57.393]  Central time, the hour after the show ends.
[00:03:57.473 --> 00:04:01.497]  It serves out to, I don't know, hundreds of thousands of people have subscribed.
[00:04:02.578 --> 00:04:04.840]  I don't know, it's 50-something thousand at any one time.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.403]  We guesstimate from all the terabytes being used every few days.
[00:04:09.424 --> 00:04:14.889]  But the point is, you can sign up for free at InfoWars.com.
[00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.511]  There's a podcast link there at the top.
[00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:24.258]  And you can sign up to your MP3 or iPod and get the three hours when you want, how you want, listen to it where you want, when you want.
[00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.219]  So that's InfoWars.com and that's free.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.901]  Not free for us to do it, but free for you.
[00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:32.202]  We hope you'll share the information.
[00:04:32.642 --> 00:04:34.323]  We hope you'll spread the information.
[00:04:34.343 --> 00:04:46.709]  We want to thank those that have been spreading the information valiantly, diligently, aggressively prosecuting the war against the New World Order in the wolf pack operations against the globalists.
[00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:53.102]  And then of course, there's also PrisonPlanet.tv, all my films and much more.
[00:04:53.122 --> 00:04:57.249]  $0.15 a day, $5.95 a month.
[00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.651]  Get your membership today.
[00:04:58.691 --> 00:04:59.393]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.608 --> 00:05:10.052]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.452 --> 00:05:18.077]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:25.842]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:37.669]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:41.432]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.912 --> 00:05:43.853]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.193 --> 00:05:47.976]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:05:48.636 --> 00:05:55.960]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:04.713]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.753 --> 00:06:08.795]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.915 --> 00:06:11.497]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.557 --> 00:06:13.878]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.058 --> 00:06:22.503]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:23.884]  The brookie light is different.
[00:06:24.024 --> 00:06:28.046]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:28.046 --> 00:06:28.546]  We're good to go!
[00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:51.501]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.
[00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:53.402]  888-03-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:06:53.422 --> 00:06:54.102]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.071]  Do you know that you can go solar for under 1200 bucks now?
[00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:05.732]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[00:07:05.932 --> 00:07:10.094]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:07:10.674 --> 00:07:15.576]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[00:07:16.076 --> 00:07:22.499]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:25.944]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[00:07:26.104 --> 00:07:36.069]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:40.051]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[00:07:40.091 --> 00:07:46.594]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[00:07:46.774 --> 00:07:47.815]  Are you ready to go solar?
[00:07:48.015 --> 00:07:48.975]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[00:07:52.877 --> 00:07:56.940]  Or order them on the website at a 10% discount on KenSolar.com.
[00:07:57.181 --> 00:07:59.462]  That's KenSolar.com.
[00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:06.662]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.302 --> 00:08:08.383]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.083 --> 00:08:10.223]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.863 --> 00:08:11.684]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.404 --> 00:08:14.324]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.344 --> 00:08:17.905]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:22.286]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.567 --> 00:08:27.187]  Well, it wasn't a surprise to anyone.
[00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:32.689]  President Bush and that smoke and mirrors carnival scam
[00:08:33.852 --> 00:08:41.943]  That he runs with the shysters in Congress, vetoed the troop hold-down.
[00:08:43.986 --> 00:08:46.750]  The troops are never going to leave Iraq.
[00:08:47.051 --> 00:08:47.331]  Ever.
[00:08:47.712 --> 00:08:50.756]  We're talking 200 years probably, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:51.644 --> 00:09:08.252]  The official Pentagon and Israeli plans were troops for at least 30 years, permanent bases, de-industrialization, and then the armored bases will just protect the pipelines pumping out the oil while they play the different sectarian groups off against each other.
[00:09:08.732 --> 00:09:12.494]  It's cold-blooded, it's wicked, but it's pure genius.
[00:09:13.354 --> 00:09:19.277]  It's the order-out-of-chaos paradigm that our enemies operate on, and the general public believes they're propaganda.
[00:09:20.598 --> 00:09:25.381]  The war has been executed beautifully by President Bush's controllers.
[00:09:25.761 --> 00:09:27.022]  That's why they're in power.
[00:09:27.062 --> 00:09:28.463]  That's why they're carrying the ball.
[00:09:29.784 --> 00:09:38.950]  Those that tell you they've dropped the ball, that they're a bunch of buffoons, Bush was chosen for his bumbling so that they can have that convenient illusion.
[00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:45.014]  It's been carried out with the same scientific precision that can shoot a cruise missile down your chimney.
[00:09:45.594 --> 00:09:48.796]  With the same precision that brings you an IRS audit.
[00:09:49.412 --> 00:09:53.335]  With the same precision of that red light camera that gives you a ticket.
[00:09:54.035 --> 00:09:55.336]  It's done with focus.
[00:09:55.436 --> 00:10:02.921]  Yes, government is bumbling and like jello and tar to get through at the low level with red tape.
[00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:07.524]  That's designed to immobilize you and burn up your extra energies.
[00:10:09.065 --> 00:10:27.069]  At the top of the pyramid, it is a white, bright light, burning through humanity, completely and totally focused, with precision, as they play out these thespian, theatrical events for the general public, who buys it hook, line, and sinker.
[00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.410]  Though more and more, that's starting to change.
[00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.631]  So, embattled Bush vetoes Iraq withdrawal plan.
[00:10:35.672 --> 00:10:37.072]  We'll be going over that.
[00:10:38.496 --> 00:10:40.979]  Also, key U.S.
[00:10:41.319 --> 00:10:43.601]  Army ranks begin to thin.
[00:10:43.641 --> 00:10:44.822]  That's all part of the plan.
[00:10:45.263 --> 00:10:49.888]  They will accelerate the level of illegal alien felons, aggravated felons, that make up the ranks.
[00:10:50.929 --> 00:10:55.173]  If you just almost ran off the road and you're laughing at me, you're not aware.
[00:10:56.081 --> 00:11:00.462]  Twenty percent plus of the ground force is illegally and legalized in Iraq in the army.
[00:11:00.482 --> 00:11:02.163]  Twenty percent of the army force.
[00:11:02.703 --> 00:11:03.443]  That was a year ago.
[00:11:03.483 --> 00:11:04.184]  That was in the paper.
[00:11:04.524 --> 00:11:07.965]  Many of them are aggravated felons and this is all part of the plan.
[00:11:08.005 --> 00:11:11.566]  They have opened giant, well they've expanded giant recruiting stations in Mexico City.
[00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:28.147]  Uh, in Manila in the Philippines, uh, in, uh, the former Eastern Bloc, uh, from, uh, Poland, uh, in to, uh, many other areas of Georgia, and I'm not talking about Georgia peaches, I mean up against the former Soviet Union, now the Soviet Republic, the Russian Republic.
[00:11:30.188 --> 00:11:32.508]  Man, I'm having a, uh, connoisseur rice slip up there.
[00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:36.569]  CFR warns of false flag terror.
[00:11:38.195 --> 00:11:40.857]  attack to ignite Iran war.
[00:11:41.077 --> 00:11:42.378]  Yes, you just heard me right.
[00:11:42.418 --> 00:11:47.021]  Council on Foreign Relations warns of false flag attack to ignite war.
[00:11:47.601 --> 00:11:54.065]  Paul Watson has this bombshell report for you at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:11:55.887 --> 00:12:02.351]  Echoing Brzezinski's veiled threat, but absurdly pins potential blame on Al-Syedah,
[00:12:03.983 --> 00:12:14.954]  Also, fertilizer terrorists fingered intelligence agencies, ISI implicated, 7-7 links exposed, terror network controlled by intel beyond doubt.
[00:12:15.606 --> 00:12:18.708]  And that's from the cautious Steve Watson, so you can put it in the bank.
[00:12:19.168 --> 00:12:21.770]  That's up on InfoWars.net right now, headline.
[00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:22.971]  We'll be going over that.
[00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.432]  And again, we have St.
[00:12:25.492 --> 00:12:33.637]  John Hunt, the son of the Black Op commander, E. Howard Hunt, with the deathbed confession of the assassination of JFK.
[00:12:36.994 --> 00:13:01.526]  43 years ago, joining us, on air, in the third hour, with new powerful revelations, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, on the attempted buyout of the Dow Jones and Wall Street Journal, the Dow Jones Company, which holdings is the Wall Street Journal, the second biggest paper in the country, many other publications and internet systems and technology indexes, as well as the Dow Jones Industrial
[00:13:02.612 --> 00:13:20.168]  system itself, that entire scale, exactly what Rupert wants as a British intel officer, working for the Pentagon publicly, but, and of course they're behind Hillary, Roger Ailes and Rupert are behind Hillary, and conservatives are just now learning this to their absolute horror.
[00:13:21.609 --> 00:13:24.152]  You think Fox News is conservative?
[00:13:26.994 --> 00:13:27.735]  Oh my goodness.
[00:13:28.716 --> 00:13:30.398]  Oh, sometimes it just gets too rich.
[00:13:30.919 --> 00:13:34.824]  Now, JFK Murder Plot Deathbed Confession aired on National Radio.
[00:13:34.864 --> 00:13:38.067]  We'll be going over that and the Murdoch situation.
[00:13:38.088 --> 00:13:38.428]  But you know what?
[00:13:38.448 --> 00:13:44.976]  I always say I'll go to calls in the second segment from 8 minutes in to 21 after in that long segment I never do.
[00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:48.320]  Let's just keep a promise this time and actually go to him.
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.420]  Gary in Ohio.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.681]  First time caller.
[00:13:50.701 --> 00:13:51.401]  You're on the air.
[00:13:51.421 --> 00:13:53.702]  Hey Alex, this is Gary in Columbus, Ohio.
[00:13:53.722 --> 00:13:54.602]  First time caller.
[00:13:54.642 --> 00:13:54.962]  Welcome.
[00:13:55.242 --> 00:13:55.882]  I'm doing okay.
[00:13:55.902 --> 00:13:56.482]  What's on your mind?
[00:13:56.822 --> 00:14:05.605]  Hey, I just wanted to encourage your listeners to start using Digg.com more because I think we're getting some real... It's actually starting to work.
[00:14:05.785 --> 00:14:07.546]  Well, let's be clear for those that don't know.
[00:14:08.786 --> 00:14:10.747]  Digg is a user
[00:14:11.847 --> 00:14:22.936]  Content-based synergy with news or alternative mainstream news, video clips, you name it, get posted as news or as posts and people comment on it and vote it up or down to the main page.
[00:14:23.556 --> 00:14:29.821]  It's hundreds of times bigger than the Drudge Report that's 550-something and digs like 50-something last time I checked.
[00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:30.922]  Ultra-massive.
[00:14:31.462 --> 00:14:32.823]  Tens of millions of visitors.
[00:14:33.204 --> 00:14:35.365]  Really, I haven't looked at the index lately.
[00:14:35.665 --> 00:14:38.948]  They're on Alexa, but I would imagine tens of millions an hour, not tens of millions a day.
[00:14:38.968 --> 00:14:41.430]  And it's, you know, hundreds of times bigger than Drudge.
[00:14:42.339 --> 00:14:45.341]  And we have been banned on there officially by Digg.
[00:14:45.381 --> 00:14:49.263]  They even put out a release five months ago, but then we countered that.
[00:14:49.283 --> 00:14:50.884]  They unbanned the Prison Planet.
[00:14:51.244 --> 00:14:53.545]  They first had claimed we were fake news like the Onion.
[00:14:53.645 --> 00:14:54.686]  No, we're the real news.
[00:14:54.966 --> 00:14:55.767]  We make the news.
[00:14:56.387 --> 00:14:57.788]  We are in there ferreting it out.
[00:14:58.388 --> 00:15:24.541]  And we're news makers, and then they saw our popularity, they thought that was fake, and so they have the Dig Brigade, a lot of them who work for Dig, who purposely bury us, but as the experience rate of our diggers, our patriot diggers, our truth diggers, our info warriors, goes up, our voting power increases, that's how it works, it has a precedent, and we are exploding, and now finally defeating the censors, and they're screaming and howling, and we have Dig revolts!
[00:15:25.021 --> 00:15:29.904]  Going on as we take over Digg, and again it's not just this site doing it, it's all of us together.
[00:15:30.104 --> 00:15:31.164]  Now go ahead, I'll shut up.
[00:15:31.605 --> 00:15:38.048]  Okay, well I just wanted to say we actually got a couple of Jones Report sites on front page.
[00:15:38.088 --> 00:15:44.732]  We've made them popular like the Nine Channels thing that was covered and Luke Building 7 with the police.
[00:15:45.652 --> 00:15:54.277]  And I just wanted to tell people that are using Digg to use the add friend feature when you see someone that's spreading 9-11 truth to add them as a friend and then what you can see
[00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:58.909]  When they're digging other stories, because it's hard to spot all the truth stories that come out.
[00:15:59.069 --> 00:16:04.360]  That way we can vector in and swarm in on enemy capital ships and with combined firepower, sink them.
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.544]  Exactly, and one other thing I just want to add.
[00:16:07.223 --> 00:16:09.404]  There was a big victory for hackers yesterday.
[00:16:09.744 --> 00:16:14.747]  They were trying to ban this one story, but they just got so many people.
[00:16:15.227 --> 00:16:16.648]  They got it up on Prison Planet.
[00:16:16.688 --> 00:16:19.249]  It was a key code hack for HD.
[00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.890]  I'm all about getting the info out.
[00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:21.391]  It's great.
[00:16:21.431 --> 00:16:22.431]  That's total freedom.
[00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:24.272]  It's what we need against these enemies.
[00:16:25.313 --> 00:16:26.193]  Tell folks what happened.
[00:16:26.894 --> 00:16:29.115]  Well, it's on the BBC now, actually.
[00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:35.298]  They might be even sued over this, because some big interest group doesn't want that code to come out.
[00:16:35.819 --> 00:16:41.680]  But they officially decided, because of mass opinion, to allow it on the site, and I think the same thing can happen.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.900]  Well, they tried to ban it.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.701]  I just read this last night, but they tried to ban it, and then they got swarmed.
[00:16:48.721 --> 00:16:52.822]  It was dubbed a Dig Revolt, and then Dig just basically capitulated.
[00:16:53.242 --> 00:16:59.383]  Yeah, every single story on the front page was that DVD key thing.
[00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:01.924]  And that's because... I just wanted to share that.
[00:17:02.604 --> 00:17:03.704]  Alex, you're doing a great job.
[00:17:04.104 --> 00:17:04.484]  Keep it up.
[00:17:05.026 --> 00:17:06.086]  Hey, I appreciate you.
[00:17:06.106 --> 00:17:10.828]  And listen, folks, I put myself right out on the edge.
[00:17:10.888 --> 00:17:12.769]  I put myself right out there as a target.
[00:17:13.409 --> 00:17:15.490]  I literally am on the front lines of this fight.
[00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.451]  And it's a Catch-22.
[00:17:17.531 --> 00:17:20.292]  I know the more popular, the bigger I get, the more danger I'm in.
[00:17:20.552 --> 00:17:22.593]  But then if I don't do that, I'm also in danger.
[00:17:23.193 --> 00:17:27.474]  Because having that notoriety gives you some level of protection.
[00:17:28.015 --> 00:17:30.095]  But believe me, it isn't about Alex Jones.
[00:17:30.256 --> 00:17:31.316]  We need your help.
[00:17:32.592 --> 00:17:38.736]  To get our censored stories on the main page of Digg, where they can then go supernova and infect the rest of the internet.
[00:17:39.056 --> 00:17:40.457]  It is a viral port.
[00:17:41.017 --> 00:17:47.762]  It is a main zone for us to breach the wall, which we routinely do, but I mean breach it in a big way.
[00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.964]  And yes, it infuriated people.
[00:17:51.004 --> 00:17:55.727]  In fact, I've told Steve Watson, I've told Paul Watson, I want a story about this Digg breach.
[00:17:56.431 --> 00:17:58.933]  Now, we should have done that last night, but I don't have enough writers.
[00:17:58.953 --> 00:17:59.934]  I don't have enough personnel.
[00:18:00.314 --> 00:18:08.361]  You, the listeners, when you see this, write an article, and then we'll scan it if it's good material, which most of the stuff you send us is better than what we write.
[00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:10.002]  We have a lot of genius listeners.
[00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:14.045]  You know, I'm a blithering idiot compared to many of you, and believe me, I read the stuff you write.
[00:18:14.826 --> 00:18:16.427]  And then you give it to us.
[00:18:16.527 --> 00:18:19.549]  We'll magnify it and jump it to the next level.
[00:18:19.589 --> 00:18:20.150]  You understand?
[00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:29.557]  I mean, we can take the smallest thing that 10 people read on your MySpace, and if it's well written and has documentation, then hundreds of thousands conservatively will see it.
[00:18:29.978 --> 00:18:38.046]  That will then basically jump it, hyper-warp it to the next level, and then we can blast through the enemy defenses.
[00:18:38.726 --> 00:18:41.129]  And folks, when I talk like that, I really mean it, okay?
[00:18:41.389 --> 00:18:43.011]  I picture it all as a battlefield.
[00:18:43.855 --> 00:18:46.236]  And, uh, we are literally fighting for our lives here.
[00:18:46.657 --> 00:18:58.383]  And I'm telling you, we have to blow out their defenses, take their machine gun nest, move on to the higher ground, and exploit that high ground to take the next hill, so that we can engage them from high ground.
[00:18:58.803 --> 00:18:59.664]  And that's what we're doing!
[00:19:00.144 --> 00:19:00.364]  Okay?
[00:19:00.404 --> 00:19:12.891]  I literally climbed on my belly, up out of the slimy swamps, all the way up to a mountain, and now I'm firing howitzers at the next highest mountain, but believe me, we're under bombardment, we are under attack!
[00:19:13.431 --> 00:19:21.534]  If you will simply join us in the fight, we will take the next mountain and move on for the main citadel of the New World Order!
[00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:23.054]  This is not a joke!
[00:19:23.274 --> 00:19:24.515]  This is not a game!
[00:19:24.735 --> 00:19:25.955]  This is life and death!
[00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:28.716]  And they know it!
[00:19:30.037 --> 00:19:32.238]  They're debating pulling the plug on the whole web.
[00:19:32.258 --> 00:19:36.359]  They're trying to figure out how to do it right now with Internet 2 because of what we're doing to them.
[00:19:37.478 --> 00:19:40.199]  USA Today has some, you know, the big ten benchmarks of the web.
[00:19:40.379 --> 00:19:45.802]  They don't mention the people getting their own voice and exposing and overthrowing the oligarchs.
[00:19:46.222 --> 00:19:49.023]  We are on the edge of a Ceausescu type victory.
[00:19:50.444 --> 00:19:53.525]  We are on the edge of a Romanian type overthrow of these people.
[00:19:54.045 --> 00:19:54.626]  They know it!
[00:19:55.006 --> 00:19:57.647]  You need to realize it and then we can take victory!
[00:20:02.697 --> 00:20:04.758]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.378 --> 00:20:14.302]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.742 --> 00:20:21.945]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.674 --> 00:20:28.155]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.655 --> 00:20:39.497]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.237 --> 00:20:42.318]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.798 --> 00:20:44.218]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:52.924 --> 00:21:07.270]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:13.252]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:13.452 --> 00:21:16.193]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:17.334]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:18.678 --> 00:21:23.281]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:31.485]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:32.486 --> 00:21:35.548]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:36.448 --> 00:21:41.151]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:21:42.132 --> 00:21:43.412]  Call for your copy today.
[00:21:43.432 --> 00:21:43.632]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.898 --> 00:21:52.745]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:53.506]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.526 --> 00:21:53.827]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.198 --> 00:22:06.279]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:22:06.339 --> 00:22:13.662]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:22:13.802 --> 00:22:24.445]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:22:24.625 --> 00:22:29.166]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:22:29.466 --> 00:22:34.449]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.612]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:37.832 --> 00:22:47.698]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.
[00:22:47.718 --> 00:22:52.622]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:52.662 --> 00:22:54.703]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:23:01.507 --> 00:23:07.990]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:12.252]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[00:23:12.492 --> 00:23:14.653]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[00:23:15.013 --> 00:23:21.976]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[00:23:22.356 --> 00:23:24.958]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[00:23:25.218 --> 00:23:28.740]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:36.884]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:23:37.284 --> 00:23:38.785]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:23:39.045 --> 00:23:50.952]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[00:23:51.432 --> 00:23:52.173]  We're good to go.
[00:24:15.445 --> 00:24:29.433]  I'd like to see your submissions, and we take about 90% of them, on Digg's censorship, on their history, how they've now been crushed, and how this can be used as a precedent to continue to crush their censorship and their conniving behavior.
[00:24:30.254 --> 00:24:40.099]  Because it's one thing to block people posting codes or ways to crack an HD system with encoding and encryption.
[00:24:40.936 --> 00:24:50.599]  It's another thing entirely just to say no 9-11 stuff is allowed on the main page or no real criticism of say Dime Corps and child kidnapping ranks.
[00:24:50.659 --> 00:24:55.560]  They won't let you post the Chicago Tribune articles or others that came out about kidnapping children.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.501]  I guess the people that run it think hostile type, you know, behavior.
[00:24:59.561 --> 00:25:00.842]  Hostiles are real folks.
[00:25:00.862 --> 00:25:01.882]  That's not just a movie.
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.661]  I guess they think that's no big deal.
[00:25:05.121 --> 00:25:21.487]  You see, we need to, if somebody's going to advertise themselves as a free speech zone, and you get to vote, and what you want goes to the main page, and then they engage in fraud, and lie, and stuff the ballot box, and block out, and elect what they want, and cheat.
[00:25:21.868 --> 00:25:25.329]  Who wants to see a boxing match where it's rigged?
[00:25:26.238 --> 00:25:29.259]  Who wants to go to the Derby to see a rigged horse race?
[00:25:29.639 --> 00:25:31.879]  Who wants to go to a football game that's rigged?
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.440]  Or a baseball game that's rigged?
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.960]  Or a hockey game that's rigged?
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.621]  Well, Dig is rigged, okay?
[00:25:37.981 --> 00:25:38.541]  Period.
[00:25:39.441 --> 00:25:46.423]  And we need to write a bunch of articles about this, post them on Prison Planet, post them on InfoWars, really take the best one out there.
[00:25:46.463 --> 00:25:49.464]  You guys and gals can collectively choose which one you think is the best.
[00:25:49.684 --> 00:25:50.464]  We'll post them all.
[00:25:51.244 --> 00:25:53.165]  And you can dig it.
[00:25:53.985 --> 00:25:57.646]  To really get the full story of Digg and what they do.
[00:25:57.666 --> 00:26:00.686]  Alright, I don't want to spend all day on Digg.
[00:26:00.806 --> 00:26:06.568]  If you want to send stories to us, send them to Aaron at InfoWars.com and Watson at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:26:07.928 --> 00:26:09.648]  Or Ryan at InfoWars.com.
[00:26:09.668 --> 00:26:10.488]  Send them to all three.
[00:26:10.548 --> 00:26:12.189]  Make sure one of them gets it posted.
[00:26:13.689 --> 00:26:17.750]  I mean, we have cracks in the facade.
[00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:18.330]  Big ones.
[00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:23.651]  Big holes to exploit and send our running backs through.
[00:26:24.295 --> 00:26:25.656]  We've had victory after victory.
[00:26:25.716 --> 00:26:27.197]  Believe me, we're just getting started.
[00:26:28.357 --> 00:26:31.399]  And again, I want you right beside me and in front of me and behind me.
[00:26:31.899 --> 00:26:42.885]  I am just one gunboat commander in a little bitty gunboat with a crew of maybe 10 people, you know, firing torpedoes, firing depth charges, firing a 50-cal machine gun.
[00:26:42.905 --> 00:26:46.787]  I mean, I'm right up there, ladies and gentlemen, on deck just firing that 50-cal.
[00:26:47.107 --> 00:26:49.128]  And there's thousands of us swarming
[00:26:49.688 --> 00:26:55.993]  Each one of their capital ships, each one of their missile cruisers, each one of their battleships, they cannot stop us all.
[00:26:56.353 --> 00:27:14.186]  And if we just stop whining, and stop talking about how big the battleship is, and stop talking about how there's no way to defeat it, and stop talking about how bad they are, and how they're going to get us, if we just open fire, and target the enemy, and put the truth out, and do not stop, never stop,
[00:27:15.754 --> 00:27:17.575]  You're going to start seeing those ships explode.
[00:27:17.996 --> 00:27:19.757]  You're going to see their magazines erupt.
[00:27:20.558 --> 00:27:20.838]  Okay?
[00:27:20.878 --> 00:27:21.799]  And we've already seen that.
[00:27:22.399 --> 00:27:25.321]  We have seen their lie about the Iraq War, blown wide open.
[00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:27.543]  Their lie about 9-11, blown wide open.
[00:27:27.723 --> 00:27:30.445]  Their lie about CPS being good guys, blown wide open.
[00:27:31.766 --> 00:27:34.288]  Their lies about depleted uranium, blown wide open.
[00:27:35.249 --> 00:27:38.931]  I mean, think about JFK, completely and totally blown wide open.
[00:27:39.191 --> 00:27:41.033]  But it doesn't take 40 years anymore.
[00:27:41.093 --> 00:27:42.454]  It takes a few months now.
[00:27:43.197 --> 00:27:54.219]  They're totally losing credibility, so they're racing out of the soft power paradigm of oppressing us through different veils and different propaganda arms and velvet gloves.
[00:27:54.239 --> 00:27:58.000]  They've taken the velvet off the fist, and now the iron fist is coming down on us.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.160]  And I say, good!
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.280]  It's just like a fight in the real world, just like a fist fight when you were a teenager.
[00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:05.361]  You're scared until the person hits you.
[00:28:05.801 --> 00:28:11.782]  And as soon as they make a swing, or as soon as they knock you upside the head, you just energize.
[00:28:12.572 --> 00:28:15.814]  And I say let them act like tyrants and let them bring it on.
[00:28:15.834 --> 00:28:18.896]  You know, George Bush wants to shoot his mouth off about bringing it on.
[00:28:19.176 --> 00:28:22.058]  Listen to me, you little blue blood British intel piece of trash.
[00:28:22.578 --> 00:28:27.901]  You think this country belongs to you and the scumbags that run you out of Europe and Israel and the rest of it.
[00:28:28.361 --> 00:28:29.962]  You do not run this country.
[00:28:30.803 --> 00:28:32.584]  You do not run the American people.
[00:28:32.704 --> 00:28:36.586]  And you have tried and you have tried to go too far and that whore Hillary Clinton.
[00:28:36.986 --> 00:28:41.709]  You know, there are some of us who aren't afraid of you and Rupert Murdoch and your whole gaggle of crooks.
[00:28:42.455 --> 00:28:52.593]  And you've pushed too far and you've tried to kill this country, you've tried to accelerate the illegal aliens pouring in, trying to sink us as fast as you can, and I'm telling you it's a race you've lost.
[00:28:54.167 --> 00:28:58.691]  We've got to start believing in ourselves and believing in the power of God to stand up against evil.
[00:28:58.791 --> 00:29:17.386]  I'm telling you, the number one problem is these churches that tell you, sit there in your church, don't ever get involved in any politics, don't get involved in anything, don't get involved fighting abortion or any of the issues, just feel good and the worst things get, that means Jesus is that much closer to coming and pulling you out of it.
[00:29:18.211 --> 00:29:19.553]  Well, let me tell you something, folks.
[00:29:19.733 --> 00:29:20.555]  Duty is ours.
[00:29:20.615 --> 00:29:21.817]  Consequence belongs to God.
[00:29:22.117 --> 00:29:23.740]  Let's say God's coming next week.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.182]  Which isn't the case, by the way.
[00:29:26.825 --> 00:29:27.666]  You'll see next week.
[00:29:28.547 --> 00:29:30.009]  Let's just say that's the case.
[00:29:31.042 --> 00:29:33.904]  Is it okay for you to sit there and let evil go on all around you?
[00:29:33.925 --> 00:29:43.212]  You see, that's why we've been pacified when the government, 75 years ago, through the World Council of Churches, started taking over our churches.
[00:29:43.753 --> 00:29:46.375]  And now they're a bunch of feel-good social clubs.
[00:29:46.595 --> 00:29:48.196]  They're a bunch of whorehouses!
[00:29:52.019 --> 00:29:53.040]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.022]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.042 --> 00:29:58.605]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.281 --> 00:30:05.022]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[00:30:05.402 --> 00:30:08.402]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[00:30:08.683 --> 00:30:10.763]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?
[00:30:11.063 --> 00:30:15.364]  Now there's SFR Green, performance technologies for a clean planet.
[00:30:15.704 --> 00:30:21.546]  SFR Green's Protector reduces emissions and improves fuel economy, meeting automakers' new standards.
[00:30:21.786 --> 00:30:23.086]  So do something green.

[00:30:32.805 --> 00:30:35.287]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:30:35.747 --> 00:30:37.649]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.532]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:30:42.193 --> 00:30:48.678]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:30:49.439 --> 00:30:51.660]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:30:52.041 --> 00:30:52.261]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:30:52.281 --> 00:30:52.761]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:31:01.986 --> 00:31:06.568]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:31:06.968 --> 00:31:09.909]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:31:10.229 --> 00:31:12.790]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:17.972]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:31:18.353 --> 00:31:23.715]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:26.996]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:31:27.176 --> 00:31:28.717]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[00:31:29.837 --> 00:31:34.539]  Many people believe that this will be the mark of the beast because of the restrictive measures included.
[00:31:34.739 --> 00:31:38.860]  Which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:45.462]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the mark of the beast, it says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[00:31:45.802 --> 00:31:47.423]  It says, worship the beast.
[00:31:47.703 --> 00:31:50.304]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[00:31:50.584 --> 00:31:56.030]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:56.491]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:32:02.794 --> 00:32:13.780]  JLS Research, the makers of all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.503]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[00:32:20.683 --> 00:32:28.327]  By using organics and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[00:32:28.568 --> 00:32:29.268]  As it responds,
[00:32:29.528 --> 00:32:31.549]  Body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[00:32:31.829 --> 00:32:35.330]  First Responder is the first of its kind, comprised of only four organics.
[00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:38.910]  Grape seed skins, grape seeds, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[00:32:39.291 --> 00:32:43.752]  It's so effective, you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[00:32:44.052 --> 00:32:46.592]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[00:32:46.872 --> 00:32:50.353]  Go online and order First Responder at no-bo.com.
[00:32:50.553 --> 00:32:53.914]  Visit no-bo.com or call JLS Research at 850-723-8599.
[00:32:56.815 --> 00:32:57.195]  That's 850-723-8599.
[00:32:57.235 --> 00:32:59.517]  Pienso que un sueño parecido no volverá más.
[00:32:59.537 --> 00:33:04.920]  En él pintaba las manos y la cara de azul.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.342]  Y de proviso en el viento la vida me dio.
[00:33:21.773 --> 00:33:23.756]  We're good to go.
[00:33:23.816 --> 00:33:24.257]  I think?
[00:33:24.317 --> 00:33:26.620]  I think?
[00:33:37.794 --> 00:33:42.617]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:00.382 --> 00:34:12.876]  The son of former CIA agent and Watergate conspirator, E. Howard Hunt, to discuss his father's recent deathbed confession of his involvement in the JFK black operation.
[00:34:13.757 --> 00:34:18.122]  Also the former head of the Treasury, he was the Chief Economist of the Treasury.
[00:34:19.106 --> 00:34:36.212]  Editor of the Wall Street Journal to join us talking about the neocons leaving the sinking ship, but that's only the globalists putting all the bad they've done, the whole agenda that they've taken major steps in, on the group they're now replacing so they can put in fresh ones to fool the public yet again and move forward.
[00:34:37.713 --> 00:34:46.236]  And we'll talk about Rupert Murdoch's attempt to buy the Wall Street Journal from the former editor of the Wall Street Journal, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:34:48.087 --> 00:34:49.867]  So that's coming up in 30 minutes in the next hour.
[00:34:49.887 --> 00:34:52.948]  Alright, I want to get into all the new terrorism news.
[00:34:52.968 --> 00:34:54.028]  Some really important stuff.
[00:34:55.068 --> 00:35:05.630]  Plus, the LAPD was extremely restrained against a bunch of illegal aliens and their supporters running around in Los Angeles.
[00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:06.691]  Now, let me be clear.
[00:35:07.591 --> 00:35:09.651]  I don't like how the LAPD treated them.
[00:35:10.451 --> 00:35:14.032]  The LAPD violated their rights and acted like a bunch of thugs.
[00:35:15.052 --> 00:35:24.914]  But compared to what the LAPD does to other protests and other demonstrations, it's about 10% of the regular response.
[00:35:26.075 --> 00:35:30.516]  Because the news is trying to spin all this, but we did find actual videos of what was going on.
[00:35:30.536 --> 00:35:32.956]  We wish we had the stats of an article on this, too.
[00:35:33.296 --> 00:35:34.977]  Maybe you can go look it up yourself and do one.
[00:35:36.457 --> 00:35:43.799]  But the illegal aliens started throwing rocks and signs and screaming at the police about a quarter mile away from the main demonstration.
[00:35:45.809 --> 00:35:47.991]  Uh, kind of the Mexican Mafia type folks did.
[00:35:48.251 --> 00:35:57.197]  And the cops in their Darth Vader outfits didn't like it, so they opened fire on those guys and chased them into the main mass and then started attacking the news reporters and everybody else.
[00:35:57.237 --> 00:36:03.761]  And by attacking, they would just scream at them and shove them down on the ground and aim a shotgun at their face with a rubber bullet that would kill you at that range.
[00:36:05.083 --> 00:36:12.567]  Whereas normally, if it had been any other group, liberal, conservative, pro-sovereignty group, second amendment group, the police, the people would have died.
[00:36:12.587 --> 00:36:15.589]  I mean, people would have had their heads beat in.
[00:36:16.169 --> 00:36:24.954]  I mean, hell, a young girl walking out of a Red Sox game bar at 2am, no criminal record, cop just walks right up and blows her head off.
[00:36:24.994 --> 00:36:30.577]  I mean, you know, if you're in Boston, I mean, I've seen it, I've experienced it.
[00:36:31.057 --> 00:36:32.838]  You talk back, they open fire.
[00:36:33.855 --> 00:36:36.136]  And I remember last year when Rob Allen and Co.
[00:36:36.196 --> 00:36:37.497]  under... I said I'd get to this later, didn't I?
[00:36:37.517 --> 00:36:41.199]  The point is the President and Vicente Fox and Rob Allen and Co.
[00:36:41.219 --> 00:36:46.081]  that ran both their campaigns staged at, you know, tens of millions protesting over a month.
[00:36:47.442 --> 00:36:52.064]  What backfired was is they had trucks there with RNC funding handing out American flags.
[00:36:52.864 --> 00:36:55.005]  They didn't want those, they waved Mexican.
[00:36:55.045 --> 00:36:58.227]  So that kind of backfired, but this latest staged event
[00:36:59.738 --> 00:37:06.883]  In L.A., folks started throwing rocks this time, and by the way, that happened last time, and the cops just aren't going to put up with it.
[00:37:07.644 --> 00:37:13.408]  So they finally didn't follow orders to stand down and did take action.
[00:37:13.428 --> 00:37:22.414]  Remember in Seattle, we have footage of this in the Police State 2, the takeover, now available on DVD, I would add, in the Trilogy DVD that just came out, never really plugged that.
[00:37:23.315 --> 00:37:26.957]  All three are on three DVDs in one box set, 45% off, hope you get them.
[00:37:28.906 --> 00:37:31.129]  But why not just cover this now?
[00:37:31.169 --> 00:37:34.273]  I just have all these audio clips and a whole bunch I want to say.
[00:37:34.293 --> 00:37:44.926]  Yeah, in Seattle you had 60,000 peaceful demonstrators and so for a day the government had hired anarchists that they housed in a government building that were trained by the Ford Foundation in Oregon, Boston.
[00:37:46.312 --> 00:37:46.813]  I don't know.
[00:38:01.347 --> 00:38:02.229]  He's just pathetic.
[00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:10.640]  While the government agents hit him in the head, the provocateurs, so the news could show that and say, look, the police aren't doing anything, Delta Force was commanding it all.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:15.847]  That was in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Seattle Weekly, and Seattle Times, all three papers reported it.
[00:38:16.227 --> 00:38:17.289]  Again, it's all in the takeover.
[00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:18.731]  We have video of it and police admitting it.
[00:38:19.528 --> 00:38:23.531]  Because they had to set the national precedent to then attack demonstrators for no reason.
[00:38:23.791 --> 00:38:30.135]  They issued the federal Darth Vader outfits that you see police wearing everywhere now, and that was a sea change catalyzing event.
[00:38:30.655 --> 00:38:32.076]  That was a huge blackout.
[00:38:34.278 --> 00:38:43.404]  But you see, when they're told still they stand down, when they're being hit with rocks and custard, I don't recommend any other group but the illegal aliens try that.
[00:38:43.934 --> 00:38:54.557]  And of course, they didn't follow orders in L.A., and they went ahead and opened fire on you with rubber bullets, and then they did run down a bunch of innocent people and families, and welcome to our world here.
[00:38:54.697 --> 00:38:56.057]  Now, let's get honest.
[00:38:56.477 --> 00:39:05.460]  In southern Mexico, when people resisted six months ago, they opened fire on them with real machine guns and killed some Americans and press and others, and it wasn't even really in our news.
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:13.222]  So, but we'll be living like that soon enough here, if the Ceausescu-type people that run our government have their way.
[00:39:14.412 --> 00:39:15.193]  All right, I'm blitzing.
[00:39:15.253 --> 00:39:20.855]  I've got to go through your calls quickly, because I've got all this news, and then Dr. Roberts joining us, and then St.
[00:39:20.916 --> 00:39:21.616]  John Hunt.
[00:39:22.056 --> 00:39:25.498]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Los Angeles.
[00:39:25.518 --> 00:39:26.098]  Go ahead, Chris.
[00:39:27.159 --> 00:39:27.539]  Hey, Alex.
[00:39:27.579 --> 00:39:28.019]  How's it going?
[00:39:28.219 --> 00:39:28.539]  Good, sir.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:34.583]  I was going to comment on the events in Los Angeles yesterday, but you pretty much covered it off.
[00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:36.844]  Come on, I want to get your take.
[00:39:36.864 --> 00:39:37.284]  Go ahead.
[00:39:39.605 --> 00:39:42.807]  It did start with a few people throwing rocks and bottles and that kind of stuff.
[00:39:44.231 --> 00:39:45.792]  Which the media wouldn't show.
[00:39:45.832 --> 00:39:51.156]  By the way, I've got the Lori Conquista reporter, and you see her really trying to start fights with the cops.
[00:39:51.476 --> 00:39:55.600]  She's got a lot of hoots, as they say.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:03.526]  I mean, I understand she's mad, but normally that would result in her being killed with rubber bullets at point-blank range in the face.
[00:40:04.287 --> 00:40:11.733]  I mean, lesser things result in death routinely at the hands of the ringwraith Darth Vader forces, federally issued uniforms.
[00:40:13.014 --> 00:40:13.514]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:40:14.895 --> 00:40:18.718]  I must admit, I was surprised to see the amount of news coverage it got last night.
[00:40:18.738 --> 00:40:25.864]  They even showed a clip... Well, that was because it was a preferred, protected group that's being used as a battering ram to destroy the Republic.
[00:40:26.424 --> 00:40:26.905]  Absolutely.
[00:40:26.925 --> 00:40:32.269]  But they even showed, like, one of the clips of, like, a 15, 16-year-old boy being attacked by the police.
[00:40:32.289 --> 00:40:35.211]  There's one, they're really laying into him with their batons and stuff like that.
[00:40:37.513 --> 00:40:38.894]  The other thing I wanted to talk about,
[00:40:40.273 --> 00:40:46.209]  Well, I've noticed a lot of references both in 24 and the new movie Next about a nuclear bomb attack in Los Angeles.
[00:40:46.229 --> 00:40:48.414]  Do you think that this is some kind of pre...
[00:40:50.357 --> 00:40:53.178]  Pre-warning like they used in the Lone Gunman episode?
[00:40:53.258 --> 00:41:02.902]  Well, I mean, they had Mayor Ray Nagin in the FX oil storm program five months before Katrina actually really hit and did the exact thing.
[00:41:04.743 --> 00:41:14.607]  They, on Lone Gunman, had the government hijacking a jet by remote control to blame it on the Afghans as a pretext for weapon sales using government drills to smoke screen it for the rest of the government.
[00:41:14.987 --> 00:41:18.108]  And we know the CIA did approach the X-Files with many of the plots.
[00:41:18.448 --> 00:41:23.969]  I've had X-Files star, Lone Gunman star, Dean Haglin in studio and at my home in two different video interviews.
[00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:26.030]  So that's on record, yes.
[00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:33.492]  The Globalists have said LA, Denver, Dallas and Cleveland will be nuked.
[00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:41.638]  Now, the CFR normally keeps their promises, and so don't think that they've done computer models.
[00:41:41.658 --> 00:41:42.859]  They know we're going to resist them.
[00:41:43.179 --> 00:41:58.632]  They know we're going to resist going into the North American Union, merger with the EU, and they are fully prepared and ready to set off atomic or thermonuclear hydrogen weapons in the United States to blame it on Al-Qaeda, and of course the real target will be the American people.
[00:41:59.304 --> 00:41:59.925]  Yeah.
[00:41:59.945 --> 00:42:08.331]  The other thing I noticed is they've been running a lot of training exercises up at Universal City recently as well, which seems to be preparing for some kind of event in Los Angeles.
[00:42:10.432 --> 00:42:11.113]  Well, don't worry.
[00:42:11.153 --> 00:42:12.173]  They'll take good care of you.
[00:42:12.213 --> 00:42:12.834]  They care about us.
[00:42:12.934 --> 00:42:13.654]  I'm sure they will.
[00:42:14.115 --> 00:42:14.315]  Yeah.
[00:42:15.276 --> 00:42:15.896]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:42:15.916 --> 00:42:16.777]  Keep up the good work, mate.
[00:42:17.477 --> 00:42:17.838]  Thank you.
[00:42:17.878 --> 00:42:18.878]  I appreciate your call.
[00:42:19.639 --> 00:42:20.720]  We had two choices here.
[00:42:21.571 --> 00:42:32.777]  It was let them have it their way, let them be on a faster timetable, stage devastating terror attacks and win, or fight them tooth and nail and they'll still carry out attacks, but at least it'll be on our terms.
[00:42:33.578 --> 00:42:34.698]  We've chosen the latter.
[00:42:35.139 --> 00:42:36.059]  We're engaging them.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.941]  A lot of us are going to be killed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:40.482 --> 00:42:46.645]  I mean, I frankly... It'll be a miracle if I make it through this.
[00:42:47.325 --> 00:42:48.506]  But miracles do happen.
[00:42:49.583 --> 00:42:50.904]  And I am committed.
[00:42:51.164 --> 00:42:52.165]  This is not a drill.
[00:42:52.225 --> 00:42:53.186]  This is not a game.
[00:42:53.426 --> 00:42:54.326]  This is not a joke.
[00:42:54.547 --> 00:42:56.608]  These people don't play games.
[00:42:57.108 --> 00:42:58.689]  But we don't play games either.
[00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:12.459]  You see, we're on the radio, and we've got AM and FM affiliates all over the place, and we've got one of the biggest internet shows, frankly, the biggest internet show, for just three streams, out there, and we're putting the word out, and our listeners are taking action as leaders, and we don't care.
[00:43:13.968 --> 00:43:20.055]  Real simple, it's when you get committed, and you're in the fight, and that's the spirit that's going to win this fight against the New World Order.
[00:43:20.315 --> 00:43:22.818]  You've got to gut up, and you've got to commit, America.
[00:43:23.198 --> 00:43:24.439]  The world's got to commit.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:29.745]  Are we going to let them have their way with us in the ditch on our knees, or are we going to go down swinging?
[00:43:31.147 --> 00:43:34.931]  And I'm telling you, you just start swinging, folks, and you stop worrying.
[00:43:35.732 --> 00:43:36.112]  Okay?
[00:43:36.432 --> 00:43:39.093]  And you stop thinking, you're going to win this fight.
[00:43:39.273 --> 00:43:39.673]  Okay?
[00:43:39.713 --> 00:43:42.734]  And by thinking, I mean, you start thinking about how it's going to hurt to get hit.
[00:43:43.074 --> 00:43:44.574]  You start thinking about how it's scary.
[00:43:44.594 --> 00:43:46.014]  You start thinking about, oh, what will they do?
[00:43:46.374 --> 00:43:46.595]  No!
[00:43:47.435 --> 00:43:51.656]  You just ignore what they're throwing and what they're doing, and you just use that to only make you matter.
[00:43:52.156 --> 00:43:53.896]  And you just, you just get the job done.
[00:43:54.136 --> 00:43:59.538]  And in about five seconds flat, in the scheme of human history, the enemy's going to be on the ground with their heads split open.
[00:44:00.558 --> 00:44:00.878]  Okay?
[00:44:01.118 --> 00:44:01.578]  Period!
[00:44:02.481 --> 00:44:04.142]  And when they hit the ground, don't stop then.
[00:44:04.342 --> 00:44:05.783]  Give them a couple stomps to the neck.
[00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:07.944]  In the info war.
[00:44:09.525 --> 00:44:10.826]  That's what it's going to take here.
[00:44:11.086 --> 00:44:12.007]  This isn't a joke.
[00:44:12.207 --> 00:44:13.307]  We didn't attack them.
[00:44:13.327 --> 00:44:14.768]  They drew first blood.
[00:44:14.928 --> 00:44:17.170]  They've done a bunch of bad stuff.
[00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.190]  50 million abortions.
[00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:20.431]  Tens of millions autistic from the mercury.
[00:44:20.872 --> 00:44:23.974]  Millions of children and women kidnapped for sex slaverings, folks.
[00:44:24.494 --> 00:44:25.034]  Millions.
[00:44:26.555 --> 00:44:27.796]  These people are evil.
[00:44:27.856 --> 00:44:29.237]  They must be resisted.
[00:44:29.457 --> 00:44:29.957]  Period.
[00:44:30.637 --> 00:44:31.438]  Tell your preachers.
[00:44:32.208 --> 00:44:36.009]  Just stop going to these scumbag churches where they tell you how to have a limp wrist and lay around.
[00:44:36.269 --> 00:44:42.031]  Stop going to your liberal tea parties and your little hangouts where you sit around and braid each other's hair and feel good.
[00:44:42.271 --> 00:44:43.272]  TAKE ACTION!
[00:44:47.973 --> 00:44:49.834]  Jim in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:44:50.374 --> 00:44:52.195]  Hi Alex, I am a first time caller.
[00:44:53.135 --> 00:45:01.498]  It would probably come to no surprise that your Chinese astrological sign is a tiger because you have been an absolute tiger in this fight.
[00:45:02.202 --> 00:45:03.323]  And keep it up.
[00:45:03.764 --> 00:45:04.945]  We're all behind you.
[00:45:05.065 --> 00:45:06.126]  I know it's frustrating.
[00:45:06.166 --> 00:45:10.331]  The news gets a little negative and stuff, but you're doing an awesome job.
[00:45:10.491 --> 00:45:12.093]  Well, listen, we're in the good time right now.
[00:45:12.133 --> 00:45:13.394]  This isn't a hot war yet.
[00:45:13.674 --> 00:45:18.299]  We're trying to avert that and stall the New World Order so we can just kind of slowly dismantle it.
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:23.685]  Like Mike Rivera says, like the Soviet Union, we don't want this thing to go red hot.
[00:45:24.285 --> 00:45:24.565]  Right.
[00:45:24.745 --> 00:45:29.408]  And a couple, I'm just going to make a couple quick points and move on and let you get some other callers in.
[00:45:29.448 --> 00:45:31.589]  Sean David Morton was on Coast to Coast.
[00:45:31.669 --> 00:45:33.109]  He said some good things about you.
[00:45:33.389 --> 00:45:35.430]  He may make a good guest on your program.
[00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:36.431]  I need to get him on, yeah.
[00:45:36.711 --> 00:45:42.394]  Yeah, he knows a lot about the Forex, what's really going on with the dollar, and he sees the big picture like you.
[00:45:42.414 --> 00:45:44.715]  And I have two quotes from Einstein.
[00:45:45.495 --> 00:45:49.737]  The first one is, the world is a dangerous place to live, not because
[00:45:50.535 --> 00:45:54.058]  of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.
[00:45:54.919 --> 00:46:01.744]  And in the second quote, he mentioned something about when the honeybees all disappear, mankind has got about four or five years left.
[00:46:01.804 --> 00:46:05.507]  So we're we're that that is definitely going on now.
[00:46:05.667 --> 00:46:15.335]  And another one other point I saw Dana Rowe-Rubbacher, 45th District on C-SPAN last night, talked about an hour, gave the whole
[00:46:16.138 --> 00:46:20.222]  Story about Kofi Ann and Ramos and how the borders are wide open.
[00:46:20.282 --> 00:46:22.824]  He just exposed the whole thing.
[00:46:22.844 --> 00:46:24.365]  Wait a minute, he admitted it was a UN op?
[00:46:26.446 --> 00:46:29.107]  Uh, Kofi, he got into details.
[00:46:29.267 --> 00:46:37.008]  He got into how the District Attorney was... He was like Lou Dobbs on steroids.
[00:46:37.108 --> 00:46:39.109]  I mean, he was exposing the whole thing.
[00:46:39.649 --> 00:46:40.289]  Where was he?
[00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:42.610]  He was on C-SPAN last night.
[00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:43.810]  I watched about 10.30 Eastern Time last night.
[00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:44.950]  He talked about for an hour.
[00:46:50.861 --> 00:46:55.683]  Yeah, I didn't make a copy of it or anything, but I'm sure you could find it on the archives or something.
[00:46:55.703 --> 00:46:58.643]  Dana Rowe, I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name right.
[00:47:00.884 --> 00:47:01.924]  What else do I have to say?
[00:47:01.944 --> 00:47:03.905]  I think that's it.
[00:47:04.745 --> 00:47:07.006]  Yeah, try to watch that if you can.
[00:47:07.026 --> 00:47:15.328]  Oh, and at the end, it was funny, the house speaker said, after it was all done and everything, the house speaker said, oh, by the way,
[00:47:15.956 --> 00:47:18.297]  You're not allowed to criticize the President, or something.
[00:47:18.317 --> 00:47:20.638]  He made a comment, like, after he said all that.
[00:47:20.739 --> 00:47:22.459]  So, at least he let him finish.
[00:47:22.519 --> 00:47:29.403]  But, you know, he was definitely... he gave a great... By the way, all they did was criticize the President 200 years ago.
[00:47:29.443 --> 00:47:37.707]  They just passed some rule by... I mean, again, what you have is those committee chairmen as dictators, frustrating the will of the people and the Republic.
[00:47:37.747 --> 00:47:38.668]  I appreciate your call.
[00:47:39.208 --> 00:47:40.009]  Good to hear from you.
[00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:44.251]  Okay, well, I need to get that C-SPAN, then, Dana Rohrabacher.
[00:47:45.841 --> 00:47:47.442]  Let's go ahead and make another call here.
[00:47:47.502 --> 00:47:48.803]  Let's talk to Alan.
[00:47:49.603 --> 00:47:51.545]  And Alan's calling from Cleveland, Ohio.
[00:47:51.585 --> 00:47:52.225]  Thanks for holding.
[00:47:52.605 --> 00:47:53.946]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[00:47:53.966 --> 00:47:56.888]  You made my day about the nuclear hit maybe on Cleveland.
[00:47:57.088 --> 00:47:58.970]  I really enjoyed that.
[00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:00.471]  But I don't doubt it.
[00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:02.652]  Well, that's the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:48:02.672 --> 00:48:03.813]  And they like to brag.
[00:48:03.833 --> 00:48:05.775]  They like to publicly call it and then do it.
[00:48:06.175 --> 00:48:06.675]  I know that.
[00:48:07.296 --> 00:48:11.979]  But there's a couple of things I want to comment on because you're almost like reading my mind on the phone.
[00:48:12.939 --> 00:48:16.180]  One of them is, you talk about being in a gunboat.
[00:48:17.001 --> 00:48:18.841]  I was on a gunboat in Vietnam.
[00:48:19.101 --> 00:48:20.382]  Five guys, it wasn't ten.
[00:48:21.222 --> 00:48:22.422]  I understand it well.
[00:48:22.743 --> 00:48:25.103]  And again, I smell ambushes when they're coming.
[00:48:25.183 --> 00:48:26.424]  It's a sixth sense you get.
[00:48:26.444 --> 00:48:29.365]  And that's not related to the nuclear issue.
[00:48:30.005 --> 00:48:34.947]  But my, my, you know, suggestion is
[00:48:35.948 --> 00:48:43.511]  That, you know, as you're talking about all these issues, for instance, about even the Kennedy assassination, let's get to Jim Garrison there.
[00:48:44.031 --> 00:48:48.692]  One of the things he was concerned about, and he was warned about, is his life.
[00:48:49.253 --> 00:48:50.913]  For getting the news out there.
[00:48:51.533 --> 00:48:58.736]  For being somebody, like you, that puts it out there, and was worried about himself, and was worried about his family.
[00:48:59.665 --> 00:49:24.265]  Now, I don't know who exactly told him, but it's been a long time ago, but I remember the advice he got was, get on your pedestal, and rattle the cage, and make as much noise as you can, because that way, if you so much as slip on a bar of soap, and like accidentally commit suicide by shooting yourself in the head five times,
[00:49:25.788 --> 00:49:26.729]  Well, that's in the movie.
[00:49:26.769 --> 00:49:29.610]  He says he's got to stay as loud, and that's a true story.
[00:49:30.311 --> 00:49:31.871]  He had to stay as loud as possible.
[00:49:32.051 --> 00:49:32.332]  No, no, no.
[00:49:32.412 --> 00:49:33.772]  Light gives us all safety.
[00:49:34.152 --> 00:49:36.093]  The government goes after the widow.
[00:49:36.674 --> 00:49:39.235]  He goes after the single parent mom with three kids.
[00:49:39.475 --> 00:49:41.876]  The CPS grabs them and the neighbors won't help her.
[00:49:42.697 --> 00:49:45.418]  I mean, they go after the little fish.
[00:49:46.138 --> 00:49:46.378]  I was
[00:50:01.863 --> 00:50:18.053]  There was a call right after what I call Operation VTEC on the 17th to you, talking to you about, first of all, Kathy O'Brien, and then about a base, if you remember that.
[00:50:18.574 --> 00:50:20.595]  That was outside Blacksburg.
[00:50:21.035 --> 00:50:25.638]  And then a few days later, good ol' Alex comes up with a name and a place.
[00:50:25.658 --> 00:50:26.679]  He gets validated.
[00:50:27.439 --> 00:50:28.560]  That very night,
[00:50:29.295 --> 00:50:38.722]  On Sea to Sea on Coast to Coast with George Nuri, the very first two callers, one was a woman who asked about Nuri, if he knew anything about Kathy Bryan.
[00:50:38.742 --> 00:50:39.723]  He says no, he didn't.
[00:50:39.763 --> 00:50:49.711]  The second caller was a male who asked about that bass in Blacksburg, Virginia, which showed me that both quoted your show.
[00:50:50.392 --> 00:50:54.675]  And what we have here is we're starting to get a bleeding of listeners.
[00:50:57.468 --> 00:50:58.869]  Absolutely, it's called Synergy.
[00:50:58.909 --> 00:50:59.789]  Good to hear from you.
[00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:01.250]  More calls straight ahead.
[00:51:04.852 --> 00:51:05.372]  It's here.
[00:51:05.552 --> 00:51:10.335]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.715 --> 00:51:18.319]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.051 --> 00:51:26.094]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.494 --> 00:51:37.919]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.219 --> 00:51:41.700]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:44.141]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.461 --> 00:51:48.303]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.925 --> 00:52:05.466]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:05.526 --> 00:52:06.027]  are located?

[00:53:03.568 --> 00:53:07.291]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:07.611 --> 00:53:09.813]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:53:10.333 --> 00:53:16.537]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.698 --> 00:53:21.561]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.801 --> 00:53:30.806]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:54:10.399 --> 00:54:22.450]  His son of E. Howard Hunt has now released a tape of his father talking about Kaplan Kennedy or being one of the head guys.
[00:54:24.672 --> 00:54:26.173]  He'll be joining us in the third hour.
[00:54:26.954 --> 00:54:29.336]  The bottom of the next I'm going to re-air that five minute tape.
[00:54:29.416 --> 00:54:31.638]  He's got 20 minutes but this is what he's released.
[00:54:32.199 --> 00:54:34.221]  Talking about the planning with LBJ.
[00:54:35.882 --> 00:54:38.503]  Coming up in about 6-7 minutes we're going to get Paul Craig Roberts on.
[00:54:38.523 --> 00:54:43.245]  We'll continue with your calls, Roger, Al, Susan, many others that are patiently holding.
[00:54:43.285 --> 00:54:50.228]  Now let me just stop right now for a moment and encourage all of you to go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:54:50.288 --> 00:55:00.532]  Not only is it a news site updated multiple times daily, a lot of times with exclusive news, to PrisonPlanet.tv, it is also the major funding mechanism for what we do.
[00:55:01.512 --> 00:55:02.573]  One of the major mechanisms.
[00:55:03.866 --> 00:55:04.647]  And it's a great deal.
[00:55:04.667 --> 00:55:07.190]  15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:09.313]  Get a yearly membership instead of a monthly trial.
[00:55:09.913 --> 00:55:13.317]  And you get three months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:20.326]  I've made 15 films and they're all up there in a lot higher quality than you'll find them floating around on the web.
[00:55:21.518 --> 00:55:25.682]  In fact, Terror Storm is in quality so good, it looks almost as good as DVD.
[00:55:26.302 --> 00:55:32.107]  Go in there, get a 15-cent-a-day membership, download it, start burning it to disc and to DVDs.
[00:55:32.468 --> 00:55:33.589]  It's very inexpensive.
[00:55:33.749 --> 00:55:34.970]  Give those to people.
[00:55:35.751 --> 00:55:37.152]  This is life and death.
[00:55:37.632 --> 00:55:44.038]  If we don't expose who carried out 7-7 and 9-11 and how they want to get us into the Iran War, it's all covered in the film.
[00:55:45.146 --> 00:55:46.007]  Then we're in deep trouble.
[00:55:46.147 --> 00:55:49.491]  Or, really support us and buy the DVD, Terror Storm.
[00:55:49.511 --> 00:55:50.212]  You can get it as low as $9.95.
[00:55:50.652 --> 00:55:52.775]  You can get America, Freedom to Fascism.
[00:55:54.196 --> 00:55:58.682]  You can get all the other great films we carry like Mind Control by Dr. Nick Begich.
[00:55:59.842 --> 00:56:08.505]  Loose Change 2nd Edition, Iraq for Sale, Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C., Part 2, and American Mysteries.
[00:56:08.545 --> 00:56:10.846]  We've got big discounts on that.
[00:56:10.926 --> 00:56:17.289]  Look, there is a big video and bookstore with all the best stuff I've seen or read up on InfoWars.com.
[00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:24.312]  You not only support us, you support the filmmakers, the people that wrote the books, the people that have put out this important information.
[00:56:25.652 --> 00:56:27.533]  And your purchase of the books and videos
[00:56:29.247 --> 00:56:32.929]  Makes this show possible, but it's important to have this knowledge in your library.
[00:56:33.009 --> 00:56:36.972]  It's important to have this to show to your friends and neighbors and family.
[00:56:37.012 --> 00:56:46.797]  This is so important to give to your professor, or to your school teacher, or to your student group, or to your retiree group, or to your bridge club, or to your bingo club.
[00:56:46.837 --> 00:56:47.838]  I mean, I don't care.
[00:56:48.618 --> 00:56:51.140]  You better give this to your bass fishing buddies.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.721]  You better give it to your bowling buddies.
[00:56:53.303 --> 00:56:55.103]  You better start getting involved in things.
[00:56:55.143 --> 00:56:59.324]  I know a lot of you listen and you're informed, but you've never seen yourselves as active.
[00:57:00.644 --> 00:57:12.066]  You support us and you get powerful materials by going to InfoWars.com and ordering hard copies of the books and videos at really good discounts at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:57:12.086 --> 00:57:14.367]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:57:22.449 --> 00:57:40.549]  Now, see my weekly TV reports, all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, which is now out of print, all these other special reports, all these other films we've been authorized to post, 15 cents a day, PrisonPlanet.tv, three years plus running, thousands of pieces of media, all my best audio interviews, PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:57:57.436 --> 00:57:58.936]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:57:58.957 --> 00:57:59.697]  Or you can also write to me.
[00:57:59.757 --> 00:58:00.177]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:00.277 --> 00:58:00.777]  And the address is 3001
[00:58:12.871 --> 00:58:16.194]  South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:58:18.596 --> 00:58:20.178]  By the way, that's just a drop box, folks.
[00:58:20.198 --> 00:58:21.199]  That's not my office.
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:27.944]  But again, 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:58:28.125 --> 00:58:32.308]  We've got too many people coming by this office as it is.
[00:58:33.429 --> 00:58:35.111]  And we're too busy, folks.
[00:58:35.131 --> 00:58:36.732]  That's why we don't have an open office to the public.
[00:58:37.333 --> 00:58:39.635]  Alright, we'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:41.846 --> 00:58:46.935]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:58:58.660]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.341 --> 00:59:00.401]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.102 --> 00:59:02.223]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.863 --> 00:59:03.684]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.425 --> 00:59:05.325]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.345 --> 00:59:09.629]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.189 --> 00:59:14.292]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.553 --> 00:59:22.399]  Coming up, in the next hour, we have the son of E. Howard Haunt, the Black Op commander,
[00:59:24.511 --> 00:59:28.474]  When he thought he was going to die three years ago, he did die a few months ago.
[00:59:28.854 --> 00:59:32.556]  He recorded a tape admitting the hit on Kennedy.
[00:59:32.596 --> 00:59:43.524]  By the way, we have Mr. Hunt photographed with other top CIA operators, these are high-level commanders, there by the Dallas Times Herald and Dallas Morning News.
[00:59:43.664 --> 00:59:46.606]  I've already talked to LBJ's lawyer, his mistress,
[00:59:48.183 --> 00:59:52.325]  By the way, right when Hunt died, Harrelson died in prison, one of the shooters.
[00:59:52.365 --> 00:59:54.266]  He was photographed and picked up by police.
[00:59:54.866 --> 01:00:02.710]  He's already in prison for killing a federal judge at 400 yards with a .243 little white Texas deer rifle.
[01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:06.191]  Side issue, that's coming up in the next hour.
[01:00:06.211 --> 01:00:14.535]  For the next 30 minutes, I am joined by the former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Reagan and former Associate Editor of the Wall Street Journal,
[01:00:15.327 --> 01:00:31.795]  Paul Craig Roberts, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, about former CIA Director George Tenet and other neocon rats who are now rapidly leaving the sinking ship, and Rupert Murdoch's $5 billion now failed, but it's not the end of the story, offered to buy Dow Jones Company, that also owns the Wall Street Journal.
[01:00:32.255 --> 01:00:35.636]  We'll talk about Tenet speaking out, and we'll talk about why all this is happening.
[01:00:35.976 --> 01:00:37.797]  Dr. Roberts, thank you for coming on, sir.
[01:00:38.698 --> 01:00:39.158]  You're welcome.
[01:00:40.871 --> 01:00:42.092]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:00:42.152 --> 01:00:42.972]  So much has happened.
[01:00:42.992 --> 01:00:45.113]  Your columns are always riveting and informative.
[01:00:45.133 --> 01:00:47.854]  What do you think is most important right now, other than what I mentioned?
[01:00:48.414 --> 01:00:51.195]  Well, it's your show, Alex, so I'll let you call the tune.
[01:00:51.755 --> 01:00:54.636]  Well, what's going on with Tenet?
[01:00:54.696 --> 01:00:58.137]  I mean, obviously it's pretty pathetic now, because he did say slam dunk.
[01:00:58.157 --> 01:01:01.578]  He did cheerlead and help frame the intelligence back to Cheney's office.
[01:01:02.059 --> 01:01:03.939]  Why do you think now you see Tenet doing this?
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:09.061]  Well, I couldn't
[01:01:09.818 --> 01:01:37.538]  Say for sure, but I think in part we have to give him the benefit of the doubt because I don't think ever before we had a situation in the government in which the President and the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense were creating a separate intelligence
[01:01:38.414 --> 01:02:01.023]  operation independent of the CIA and I don't think we've ever before had a situation in which the decision had already been made to attack Iraq and it was made independently of any CIA assessments or intelligent input.
[01:02:02.384 --> 01:02:04.204]  So, Tenet was probably
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.901]  He was trapped in a situation that no one had ever before experienced.
[01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:27.045]  I doubt that he was able to comprehend that they were creating a new form of operating that no one had ever before experienced.
[01:02:27.665 --> 01:02:30.646]  I think that left him at a loss.
[01:02:35.836 --> 01:02:42.519]  The CIA did actually participate in the orchestration.
[01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:45.781]  I think they were doing their best they could to fight it.
[01:02:46.121 --> 01:02:58.728]  Tenet himself may not have been doing much to fight it, but as I say, I think he was just kind of... Well, we know that Cheney went over there, what, like 14 times ordering them to fix the intelligence, and they finally got something.
[01:02:59.088 --> 01:02:59.628]  That's right.
[01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:04.691]  It wasn't... I think Tenet just did not ever
[01:03:05.616 --> 01:03:11.119]  No CIA director would ever have experienced that type of behavior from an administration.
[01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:24.826]  And another reason I think that the CIA is not really responsible for the war is this new attack on them by the State Department.
[01:03:25.446 --> 01:03:33.170]  The neocon, Laurie Millery, you know, the AEI, the American Enterprise Institute woman, she's just now
[01:03:34.292 --> 01:03:41.458]  It's sad that the CIA was trying to stop the war on terror.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:43.961]  Stay there.
[01:03:43.981 --> 01:03:46.963]  We're talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, syndicated columnist.
[01:03:47.003 --> 01:03:48.184]  Just type his name into Google.
[01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:49.085]  He is prolific.
[01:03:49.446 --> 01:03:50.266]  We're honored to have him.
[01:03:50.286 --> 01:03:50.867]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:56.707 --> 01:04:02.157]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.518 --> 01:04:10.091]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.859 --> 01:04:17.901]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.302 --> 01:04:29.725]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.025 --> 01:04:33.987]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.007 --> 01:04:35.907]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.268 --> 01:04:40.109]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:06:24.235 --> 01:06:26.737]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:06:27.197 --> 01:06:29.099]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:32.982]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:06:33.643 --> 01:06:40.108]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[01:06:54.759 --> 01:07:00.784]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.405 --> 01:07:04.447]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:12.874]  We see the State Department, we see the different neocon organs calling Tenet a traitor.
[01:07:13.614 --> 01:07:16.677]  The CIA wanted us to lose the war.
[01:07:17.998 --> 01:07:20.160]  We now see President Bush vetoing a
[01:07:21.005 --> 01:07:27.074]  Democratic plan that would slowly bring back some of the tribes and basically just stall it off into the election.
[01:07:27.134 --> 01:07:27.935]  More smoke and mirrors.
[01:07:27.955 --> 01:07:34.265]  A bunch of the Democrats are, as pro-war, more than Bush, Hillary and Schumer and Lieberman and all the rest of these people.
[01:07:35.779 --> 01:07:37.400]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us.
[01:07:38.041 --> 01:07:43.444]  What do you see happening as more people go public against the neocons?
[01:07:43.824 --> 01:07:52.129]  Do you see them just running the clock out and putting a Hillary in and then the whole thing starts over and suddenly Democrats will be for the war because it's just about partisan politics?
[01:07:52.349 --> 01:07:57.132]  Or do you see the Gonzales situation or something else that's clearly criminal
[01:07:57.792 --> 01:07:58.873]  Yeah, I couldn't predict, Alex.
[01:07:58.893 --> 01:08:02.655]  What I think is happening is information is coming out, starting to reach the public more.
[01:08:02.675 --> 01:08:04.916]  The public is already fed up with the war and with Bush.
[01:08:27.429 --> 01:08:27.849]  Cheney.
[01:08:28.089 --> 01:08:29.930]  They have very low approval ratings.
[01:08:30.730 --> 01:08:32.691]  But information is coming out.
[01:08:32.831 --> 01:08:47.757]  Tenet has done a positive thing because he's brought out more information that the powerful CIA director is essentially helpless given the way the current criminals are running the government.
[01:08:48.758 --> 01:08:55.060]  I don't think that the CIA was part of the problem.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.501]  Maybe they should have all resigned.
[01:08:57.561 --> 01:09:14.650]  But when you look at the attacks on the agency coming from neocons like Laurie Miller's new book, it's called Bush vs. the Beltway, and the subtitle is How the CIA and the State Department Tried to Stop the War on Terror.
[01:09:15.493 --> 01:09:31.263]  And among her crazy kinds of accusations, she says the CIA covered up evidence that Saddam Hussein orchestrated the 9-11 attacks and that Al Qaeda is a front for Iraqi intelligence.
[01:09:31.743 --> 01:09:34.825]  I mean, this is mindless stuff to be coming out at this point.
[01:09:35.445 --> 01:09:42.330]  So I think that when they attack the CIA, they're attacking it for not being part of their
[01:09:44.123 --> 01:09:49.305]  plot to deceive the people and launch the war.
[01:09:49.325 --> 01:09:50.306]  Well let's break that down.
[01:09:50.346 --> 01:09:58.549]  We know the most powerful lobby, and there's a lot of them vying for control of course, but currently the most powerful lobby is the Israeli lobby.
[01:09:58.569 --> 01:10:03.991]  I mean there's really no debating that they run this administration more than any other special interest group.
[01:10:04.011 --> 01:10:06.352]  They've got the tentacles, they know where the bodies are buried.
[01:10:06.392 --> 01:10:06.852]  That's right.
[01:10:06.912 --> 01:10:07.893]  This was their war
[01:10:08.893 --> 01:10:17.316]  And clearly, at the expense of America's name, our treasure, and actually destabilizing the planet, A, why did Israel want this war?
[01:10:18.076 --> 01:10:32.341]  And then, B, why didn't people inside the CIA resign when they did see a bunch of rural citizen, well-known foreign Shin Bet and Mossad assets literally running the nuclear codes, everything?
[01:10:33.101 --> 01:10:35.622]  Well, you know, a lot of the CIA people did resign.
[01:10:35.642 --> 01:10:37.043]  A lot of the analysts.
[01:10:39.541 --> 01:10:42.151]  I don't think it's correct to say that Israel wanted the war.
[01:10:44.897 --> 01:10:48.360]  minority in Israel, which controls that government, wanted the war.
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:52.803]  And they wanted the war because they don't have any diplomacy.
[01:10:53.043 --> 01:10:55.845]  They rely on coercion and force.
[01:10:55.865 --> 01:11:11.338]  Diplomacy is not... But again, sir, even terms like right-wing, and obviously I don't mean everybody in Israel, over half are against the war, I mean that particular virulent Likudnik, whatever you want to call it, is like a weird merger with the
[01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:16.440]  Straussian Bizarro Bushites, like a marriage made in hell.
[01:11:17.061 --> 01:11:17.921]  I mean, that's my point.
[01:11:18.201 --> 01:11:20.882]  The connection is the American neoconservatives.
[01:11:21.182 --> 01:11:21.583]  That's right.
[01:11:22.803 --> 01:11:24.844]  That's the connection between the two.
[01:11:26.905 --> 01:11:37.050]  They were well connected to the war government in Israel, and of course they staffed the Bush administration, and essentially still do.
[01:11:41.468 --> 01:11:43.269]  I think that's the story.
[01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:46.692]  They simply bypassed the State Department.
[01:11:46.712 --> 01:11:48.793]  They bypassed the CIA.
[01:11:49.494 --> 01:11:52.757]  Now, when I was in the government, the State Department was extremely powerful.
[01:11:52.797 --> 01:11:57.460]  The Treasury couldn't do anything hardly without the State Department agreeing.
[01:11:58.541 --> 01:12:03.945]  And the notion of bypassing the CIA would have been unheard of.
[01:12:03.965 --> 01:12:06.227]  So, there have been huge changes.
[01:12:06.607 --> 01:12:08.949]  And this particular administration
[01:12:09.894 --> 01:12:12.878]  Uh, you know, Colin Powell said it was a separate government.
[01:12:12.898 --> 01:12:14.300]  They created a separate government.
[01:12:15.621 --> 01:12:19.766]  So in that sense, it has been totally unaccountable.
[01:12:19.866 --> 01:12:28.457]  And so I don't, you know, don't know that Tenet really ever had any power because they made the decision to go to war.
[01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:49.439]  Well, we know that there's a global power structure where we have these interlocking interests and that there is a lot of collusion at the highest levels of finance with the overall globalist program, but over the last five years and the build-up to the war, we saw the reports in the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal of a split
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:13:11.079]  Between these elites, and now I think it's clear that split really was real, and now widening, and it seems like a lot more people in policy-making positions in the Western world and globally are now defecting to, I guess, more of the soft power Fabian type elites.
[01:13:11.459 --> 01:13:12.560]  I mean, your take on that?
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:14.302]  Is Bush becoming totally isolated?
[01:13:16.105 --> 01:13:18.727]  Yes, I think he is isolated.
[01:13:18.747 --> 01:13:25.032]  He's isolated among the public and among foreign leaders.
[01:13:26.293 --> 01:13:30.797]  We really don't have any allies to speak of, though we still buy people.
[01:13:30.837 --> 01:13:36.161]  We purchase corporations with vast sums of taxpayer money.
[01:13:36.201 --> 01:13:39.544]  That's how we basically still wield influence.
[01:13:40.862 --> 01:13:42.003]  But yes, he's isolated.
[01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:51.087]  You know, these worldwide polls have shown that the United States and Israel are tied as the second greatest threat to stability in the world.
[01:13:52.828 --> 01:14:01.032]  And they don't consider Russia or China or North Korea or any of these places to be the same threat as the United States and Israel.
[01:14:01.633 --> 01:14:05.735]  Dr. Roberts, what's your analysis of your take on Hillary and Schumer
[01:14:06.457 --> 01:14:07.878]  Well, I think that
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:42.286]  Given the power of AIPAC, it's very difficult for any politician to go against the Israel lobby.
[01:14:42.726 --> 01:14:44.288]  That's for sure.
[01:14:46.689 --> 01:14:55.416]  I don't know that the Democrats are as infiltrated with the neocons at this time as the Bush people.
[01:14:56.177 --> 01:14:58.839]  And I think their agenda is somewhat different.
[01:15:01.973 --> 01:15:11.117]  But we are faced with the fact that America today is ruled by very powerful organized interest groups.
[01:15:11.217 --> 01:15:13.398]  It's not just the Israel lobby.
[01:15:13.498 --> 01:15:15.419]  It's the military security complex.
[01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:17.320]  It's oil.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:26.103]  It's the transnational corporations that want to offshore all the American jobs.
[01:15:26.703 --> 01:15:27.744]  And these are very powerful.
[01:15:28.763 --> 01:15:33.685]  Interest groups because they have vast sums of money to allocate to politics.
[01:15:33.765 --> 01:15:34.886]  And they're not going to stop.
[01:15:35.466 --> 01:15:37.226]  And they're not going to stop.
[01:15:37.307 --> 01:15:50.852]  But when the consequences of Bush's policy prove to be detrimental for America's standing and influence and so on, then that is not in their interest.
[01:15:50.912 --> 01:15:55.014]  It's not in their interest to be isolated and despised.
[01:15:57.584 --> 01:16:00.185]  That can all turn, too, you see, Alex.
[01:16:02.045 --> 01:16:06.447]  I think the whole thing, had it not been for 9-11, none of this could have happened.
[01:16:06.947 --> 01:16:17.732]  And that's why, you know, that's probably the reason you think and argue that 9-11 was an inside job, because that set the whole thing in motion.
[01:16:17.752 --> 01:16:19.112]  That's always been the excuse.
[01:16:19.752 --> 01:16:25.275]  And it's made opposition difficult, because if you opposed it, it meant that somehow you
[01:16:26.576 --> 01:16:32.220]  I'm willing to take the attack from the terrorists and not do anything about it.
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:36.544]  So that's played into their hands totally.
[01:16:36.584 --> 01:16:39.846]  Whether or not they could do that again, I don't know.
[01:16:41.527 --> 01:16:47.492]  You know probably better than I do that Bush has set up things for martial law.
[01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:52.496]  They've got these concentration camps being built by Halleck and Burton.
[01:16:55.831 --> 01:17:04.518]  Herman knows what he might try to do, but I don't know if you can really do that in America yet without support.
[01:17:04.658 --> 01:17:17.808]  I think if he would have followed 9-11 up with an even bigger attack a few months later, they could have done it, but they didn't have their apparatchik in place yet, and I think they're so discredited now, and false flag is now in the consciousness
[01:17:18.668 --> 01:17:20.569]  I think what really is hurting him now is
[01:17:48.072 --> 01:17:52.693]  is this unwillingness to end the war because everybody can see it's pointless and going nowhere.
[01:17:53.894 --> 01:18:00.155]  And that the reasons given for it were all wrong, false.
[01:18:01.196 --> 01:18:09.578]  So the determination to persist on a course that's generally recognized as a failure
[01:18:10.566 --> 01:18:13.928]  I think it's really undermining the administration.
[01:18:14.068 --> 01:18:15.549]  Well, there aren't even enough troops.
[01:18:15.589 --> 01:18:20.172]  I mean, there's massive... Well, even if there were enough, it's not going to do the job.
[01:18:20.212 --> 01:18:24.535]  You just simply can't occupy a country that resists like that.
[01:18:25.876 --> 01:18:27.337]  And that really is the moral of the story.
[01:18:27.377 --> 01:18:30.819]  You cannot occupy people that are willing to resist to the end.
[01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:31.800]  It didn't work in 1776 or 1812.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:32.561]  It didn't work in Vietnam.
[01:18:36.961 --> 01:18:41.384]  And it didn't go too well for the Nazis in Russia, or in France, or in North Africa.
[01:18:41.824 --> 01:18:50.289]  We'll be right back with a final segment with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, syndicated columnist, former editor at the Wall Street Journal, and we'll be right back to talk about Rupert Murdoch.
[01:18:54.725 --> 01:19:03.788]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:19:04.048 --> 01:19:15.272]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:19:15.612 --> 01:19:20.674]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[01:19:20.674 --> 01:19:20.874]  I think so.
[01:19:39.534 --> 01:19:41.296]  Let's get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:19:41.356 --> 01:19:42.197]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:19:42.217 --> 01:19:42.558]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:19:42.618 --> 01:19:43.999]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:19:53.562 --> 01:19:59.784]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:00.244 --> 01:20:08.007]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:20:08.347 --> 01:20:16.229]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:20:16.509 --> 01:20:21.271]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:20:21.611 --> 01:20:26.317]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:20:26.838 --> 01:20:30.683]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:20:31.183 --> 01:20:32.205]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:20:46.438 --> 01:20:46.678]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.263 --> 01:20:54.244]  How are you doing today?

[01:21:45.073 --> 01:21:45.753]  Call 800-658-0597.
[01:21:45.773 --> 01:21:51.518]  Again that's 800-658-0597.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:53.760]  Attention gardeners!
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:56.182]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:21:56.422 --> 01:22:00.746]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[01:22:00.946 --> 01:22:08.813]  It's called Proto Grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:22:09.133 --> 01:22:11.954]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:22:12.235 --> 01:22:19.778]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:22:19.878 --> 01:22:25.481]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:22:25.701 --> 01:22:31.264]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:22:31.544 --> 01:22:34.845]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:22:35.085 --> 01:22:38.427]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:22:38.667 --> 01:22:43.710]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dirt Chief Superfood should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:22:43.730 --> 01:22:50.153]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:22:50.173 --> 01:22:51.974]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:22:54.936 --> 01:23:00.099]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.759 --> 01:23:03.160]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:05.982]  The Wall Street Journal
[01:23:07.677 --> 01:23:11.260]  It is the most respected publication in this country.
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:12.280]  There's no debating that.
[01:23:12.761 --> 01:23:15.643]  Just like the Financial Times of London is highly respected.
[01:23:15.663 --> 01:23:20.546]  And it's certainly been doing some more politicizing in the last few years and losing some of that credibility.
[01:23:21.187 --> 01:23:33.155]  But compared to Fox News and Viet Dinh on the board of directors and all the spook connections of News Corp and Rupert Murdoch, it is night and day.
[01:23:34.773 --> 01:23:54.246]  And of course, he was one of the editors over there, associate editor at the Wall Street Journal, and so he could give us a little bit of insight into how the Wall Street Journal operated, not really this new deal, which looks like it's failing as of now, but see, Murdoch can also start a bidding war over this, and he's not out of the game yet.
[01:23:54.286 --> 01:24:00.190]  He's got over $80 billion in assets right now with his TV and movie and news holdings and newspaper holdings.
[01:24:00.848 --> 01:24:12.773]  He's starting a new financial channel, and he obviously wants the credibility of it being the Wall Street Journal business news channel, and that would really be sad if that happened to the Wall Street Journal that still has some credibility.
[01:24:13.394 --> 01:24:16.675]  But again, joining us is Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, who was once an editor over there.
[01:24:17.175 --> 01:24:29.641]  Dr. Roberts, can you give us, A, your take on Fox and the neocons and Roger Ailes and Murdoch, now we learn, being a little bit behind Hillary, and then, B, what you think of this attempt by Murdoch to buy the Wall Street Journal and why that fell through?
[01:24:31.287 --> 01:24:36.051]  Well, I don't think that Murdoch is a journalist.
[01:24:36.431 --> 01:24:41.155]  He's some sort of a political power player.
[01:24:42.076 --> 01:24:47.119]  I don't think his empire is a journalistic empire.
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:51.343]  Fox News obviously is not a media outlet.
[01:24:53.244 --> 01:25:00.910]  I think he failed to buy the Journal despite the extraordinarily high price he offered
[01:25:01.656 --> 01:25:05.619]  Because Dow Jones is still owned by the Bancroft family.
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:11.243]  And they own two-thirds of the voting stock.
[01:25:11.623 --> 01:25:23.771]  So there's no way he can force a sale because other shareholders don't have the ability to vote the sale.
[01:25:24.091 --> 01:25:28.074]  He sure just made the Bancrofts a lot of money with his stock up 40-something percent.
[01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:32.813]  Yeah, but they may or may not need it.
[01:25:34.495 --> 01:25:40.741]  And I think the reason they rejected the offer is they don't regard Murdoch as a journalist.
[01:25:42.003 --> 01:25:46.187]  You see, it used to be in the United States, newspapers were owned by families.
[01:25:46.548 --> 01:25:47.449]  They had commitments.
[01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:50.392]  And they were run by journalists.
[01:25:51.434 --> 01:25:54.555]  Families may own them, but they had real journalists run them.
[01:25:54.635 --> 01:25:58.516]  And the families' names were tied into them, so they wanted them to be credible and prominent.
[01:25:58.716 --> 01:25:59.196]  That's right.
[01:25:59.236 --> 01:26:12.219]  They wanted them to be... They weren't run by advertising executives, and their value didn't consist in government broadcast licenses that could be taken away from them if they said too much against the government.
[01:26:12.279 --> 01:26:18.400]  All that changed in the 90s with the media concentration, but the Wall Street Journal is still independently owned.
[01:26:19.571 --> 01:26:27.575]  And I don't think they regard Murdoch as a person of journalistic integrity, and so they don't want to sell to him.
[01:26:28.576 --> 01:26:33.418]  Also, Murdoch was talking about gutting it and merging it with the New York Post.
[01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:34.279]  Can you imagine that?
[01:26:38.801 --> 01:26:44.524]  You know, I don't know whether the inheritance tax will eventually force the Bancrofts to sell this thing or not.
[01:26:46.221 --> 01:26:49.783]  If so, they would probably want to sell it to another family on paper.
[01:26:51.044 --> 01:26:52.825]  And there are not many left.
[01:26:55.026 --> 01:26:57.647]  And certainly not big enough to buy it.
[01:26:57.767 --> 01:27:00.468]  You were trying to say something, though, and I interrupted.
[01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:06.972]  Well, I forget what I was trying to say.
[01:27:07.932 --> 01:27:13.515]  The Bancrofts are not yet prepared to sell their soul for more money.
[01:27:15.951 --> 01:27:20.514]  I don't know of any reason that it would be forcing them to sell.
[01:27:22.054 --> 01:27:34.101]  And unless, in the later time, it has something to do with inheritance tax or, you know, being able to keep control of a company because of death duties, it might eventually force them to turn loose of it.
[01:27:34.261 --> 01:27:40.084]  Can't they do what Murdoch's done and he's put his 30% shares in News Corp into a family trust?
[01:27:41.544 --> 01:27:42.485]  Well, they probably could.
[01:27:44.429 --> 01:27:48.790]  I just don't think they're going to give it to Murdoch because they don't respect him.
[01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:59.132]  The paper has two parts, the editorial page and the news site, and they've never been on the same song sheet.
[01:28:00.632 --> 01:28:10.014]  When I was there they weren't on the same song sheet, and today even less so because the editorial page has been completely taken over by the neocons.
[01:28:13.422 --> 01:28:17.024]  And in that sense, we'd be a perfect fit for Fox News.
[01:28:17.044 --> 01:28:20.846]  There's not really much difference between the editorial page of the Journal of the Day and Fox News.
[01:28:22.707 --> 01:28:29.790]  But the paper itself is more than an editorial page, and I don't think the family will sell it to Murdoch.
[01:28:30.351 --> 01:28:33.172]  Well, thank you for your insights, joining us every few months.
[01:28:33.212 --> 01:28:37.955]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, your great columns are all over the web, and we thank you for joining us.
[01:28:38.235 --> 01:28:39.375]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:28:39.395 --> 01:28:40.696]  It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:28:41.036 --> 01:28:41.757]  Always a pleasure.
[01:28:41.777 --> 01:28:42.377]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.892 --> 01:28:46.901]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.803 --> 01:28:50.490]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.973 --> 01:29:00.117]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:29:00.337 --> 01:29:02.099]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:29:02.359 --> 01:29:08.645]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:08.945 --> 01:29:15.071]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:15.311 --> 01:29:17.173]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:29:17.293 --> 01:29:17.493]  I think?
[01:29:33.843 --> 01:29:35.704]  Using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:29:35.904 --> 01:29:38.446]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:29:38.566 --> 01:29:39.647]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:39.927 --> 01:29:40.948]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:29:41.108 --> 01:29:43.449]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:43.469 --> 01:29:43.670]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:43.690 --> 01:29:43.750]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:53.676 --> 01:29:58.202]  Summer is once again just around the corner, and as usual, so are higher gas prices.
[01:29:58.642 --> 01:30:01.786]  This year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back.
[01:30:02.266 --> 01:30:09.995]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[01:30:11.256 --> 01:30:17.860]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised, Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem, unburned fuel.
[01:30:18.281 --> 01:30:22.023]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[01:30:22.483 --> 01:30:27.326]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[01:30:27.727 --> 01:30:34.311]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[01:30:34.951 --> 01:30:36.453]  And, it's so easy to use.
[01:30:36.993 --> 01:30:42.978]  Simply pour a couple of ounces into your tank at every fill up, and you're on your way to saving money and the environment.

[01:30:54.187 --> 01:30:58.029]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[01:30:58.289 --> 01:31:02.152]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[01:31:02.532 --> 01:31:07.535]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[01:31:07.815 --> 01:31:19.021]  Electrolyzed plus water will alkalize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[01:31:19.341 --> 01:31:23.682]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and environmentally safe for humans and animals.
[01:31:23.922 --> 01:31:33.244]  Alkaline water is available as a concentrate to be mixed with good, filtered, purified RO water but not tap water, microstructured alkaline antioxidant water for consumption.
[01:31:33.404 --> 01:31:43.046]  Call for your Electrolyzed Plus Alkalinizing Miracle Rejuvenating Water Concentrate or other remarkable RPA Biotech products like Ultimate Fuel Sport Performance Drink at 888-212-8871
[01:31:45.827 --> 01:31:49.609]  That's 888-212-8871 or go to Nutramedical.com.
[01:31:49.789 --> 01:31:52.130]  That's N-U-T-R-I with an I, medical.com.
[01:31:52.190 --> 01:31:54.450]  I was a highwayman.
[01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:55.771]  Along the coach roads I did ride.
[01:31:55.811 --> 01:31:57.231]  With sword and pistol by my side.
[01:31:57.251 --> 01:31:59.472]  Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade.
[01:32:16.954 --> 01:32:20.257]  Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.
[01:32:21.379 --> 01:32:29.987]  The bastards hung me in the spring of .85, but I am still alive.
[01:32:30.007 --> 01:32:35.493]  I was a sailor, I was born upon the
[01:32:46.392 --> 01:32:52.555]  I sailed a schooner around the Horn of Mexico.
[01:32:52.675 --> 01:32:57.458]  I went along off the Pearl of the Main Salina Float.
[01:32:58.318 --> 01:33:02.200]  And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed.
[01:33:03.801 --> 01:33:10.304]  But I am living still.
[01:33:10.444 --> 01:33:15.047]  I was a dam building across a river deep and wide.
[01:33:22.428 --> 01:33:24.749]  And now Johnny Cash!
[01:33:58.263 --> 01:34:00.904]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:00.924 --> 01:34:11.488]  The spirit of adventure, the spirit of exploration lives on in the human spirit forever.
[01:34:27.777 --> 01:34:36.624]  No, we only live once, but our progeny, our children, go forward, and it's all about making the world a better place for them.
[01:34:37.104 --> 01:34:45.851]  That's the spirit that builds civilizations, and that's the spirit that will make you truly happy as a human being, because you're designed to care about others.
[01:34:45.891 --> 01:34:47.853]  You're designed to care about your people.
[01:34:48.493 --> 01:34:51.415]  Always remember who your people are.
[01:34:53.157 --> 01:34:57.300]  All right, let's go ahead, because all the tea and shine, all the gold in the hills,
[01:34:58.746 --> 01:35:04.849]  means nothing compared to family and that's your people and that's why they waged war against your family.
[01:35:04.929 --> 01:35:06.130]  That's what has value.
[01:35:06.250 --> 01:35:07.531]  That's what means something.
[01:35:08.111 --> 01:35:15.235]  Don't ever forget that and don't ever let them take that away from you and don't you ever forget what comes first.
[01:35:15.475 --> 01:35:16.316]  That's your family.
[01:35:16.336 --> 01:35:17.736]  You never rat out your family.
[01:35:18.096 --> 01:35:20.198]  You never turn your back on your family.
[01:35:20.238 --> 01:35:22.539]  If you've got to handle something, you handle it in your family
[01:35:23.763 --> 01:35:31.786]  Because this government doesn't care about you and it works for a couple of families that know that families are where the power comes from and they're waging war on our families.
[01:35:32.487 --> 01:35:33.727]  And I'm sick of it!
[01:35:35.188 --> 01:35:41.090]  So it's time for all of us as a human community and as a family to get together against the House of the New World Order.
[01:35:42.871 --> 01:35:43.291]  Alright.
[01:35:47.053 --> 01:35:49.254]  I'm not going to have time to play this once he's on with us.
[01:35:51.121 --> 01:35:54.143]  So I'm going to play it now and then maybe we'll play some clips later once he is on.
[01:35:54.163 --> 01:35:55.805]  This is E. Howard Hunt.
[01:35:55.825 --> 01:35:56.906]  I played this a few days ago.
[01:35:56.946 --> 01:35:57.666]  This is huge.
[01:35:58.347 --> 01:35:59.027]  Played it on Monday.
[01:35:59.447 --> 01:36:01.089]  This has just been aired the last couple days.
[01:36:01.129 --> 01:36:02.009]  This is brand new.
[01:36:02.029 --> 01:36:03.090]  There's 20 plus minutes.
[01:36:03.411 --> 01:36:04.852]  He's busy uploading it today.
[01:36:04.872 --> 01:36:06.213]  We'll probably have it for you tomorrow.
[01:36:07.073 --> 01:36:07.994]  The other 15 minutes.
[01:36:08.795 --> 01:36:16.821]  This is when he thought he was going to die three years ago on his deathbed in really bad shape with cancer and he made this recording.
[01:36:17.361 --> 01:36:19.483]  And then he lived another three years and then he told St.
[01:36:19.523 --> 01:36:20.804]  James he could release it when he died.
[01:36:22.759 --> 01:36:24.341]  Now, again, we don't need St.
[01:36:24.381 --> 01:36:28.625]  James Hunt, who, by the way, is a great guy, and I turned out knows about the New World Order and the rest of it.
[01:36:28.645 --> 01:36:29.625]  We had a chance to talk to him.
[01:36:31.187 --> 01:36:31.727]  I believe him.
[01:36:31.767 --> 01:36:32.528]  I believe his father.
[01:36:33.489 --> 01:36:34.910]  But I don't need to believe him or his father.
[01:36:35.331 --> 01:36:40.696]  E. Howard Hunt was clearly photographed there with Frank Sturgis, another high-level CIA, well-known operative.
[01:36:40.956 --> 01:36:43.378]  These weren't just mid-level or low-level hitmen.
[01:36:44.019 --> 01:36:48.443]  These were guys who'd run huge black ops, overthrowing whole countries.
[01:36:49.611 --> 01:36:52.573]  And Bay of Pigs that they failed in.
[01:36:52.593 --> 01:36:54.354]  I mean, these are the admitted guys.
[01:36:58.016 --> 01:37:00.757]  And, you know, they like to call them bumbling plumbers.
[01:37:01.097 --> 01:37:03.259]  They've done hundreds of ops and never been caught.
[01:37:03.279 --> 01:37:04.419]  And they finally got caught in the U.S.
[01:37:04.439 --> 01:37:05.580]  because they got sloppy.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:06.881]  Because that's what happens.
[01:37:07.261 --> 01:37:10.022]  Because they were depending on some local boobies.
[01:37:12.063 --> 01:37:14.585]  Please don't send me an email saying I'm using profanity.
[01:37:14.625 --> 01:37:16.746]  That's the name of a Southeast Asian pirate.
[01:37:17.691 --> 01:37:21.474]  Since the term boobies, and it has a connotation of bumbling idiocy.
[01:37:22.214 --> 01:37:24.236]  But the people running there certainly weren't boobies.
[01:37:24.276 --> 01:37:26.717]  Look at the headshots they pulled off in Dealey Plaza.
[01:37:27.138 --> 01:37:30.880]  But Hunt, of course, wasn't the person there pulling the trigger.
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:32.642]  He was involved in the command and control.
[01:37:33.162 --> 01:37:40.187]  He tries to protect his family because they were made aware of this by just saying he was a bench warmer, and by that he was a manager.
[01:37:41.231 --> 01:37:46.476]  But here is that five-minute tape, then we'll cover some other news, take your calls, and then we'll get St.
[01:37:46.516 --> 01:37:47.657]  John's on for a full hour.
[01:37:47.977 --> 01:37:49.218]  We appreciate him coming on.
[01:37:49.719 --> 01:37:50.079]  Here it is.
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:55.844]  We're going to sort through this a couple of times, so let's just go ahead and roll it now so that people can hear it.
[01:37:55.964 --> 01:37:56.785]  And thank you, St.
[01:37:56.805 --> 01:37:58.807]  John Hunt, for all of that background so far.
[01:37:58.987 --> 01:37:59.487]  Sure.
[01:37:59.608 --> 01:38:06.674]  Here you go, the first airing, the first national airing of the testimony of E. Howard Hunt from January of 2004.
[01:38:10.296 --> 01:38:12.978]  Assassination on Coast to Coast Live.
[01:38:13.739 --> 01:38:21.364]  I heard from Frank that LBJ had designated Cord Meier Jr.
[01:38:22.125 --> 01:38:28.249]  to undertake a larger organization while keeping it totally secret.
[01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:38.317]  Cord Meier himself was a rather favored member of the Eastern aristocracy.
[01:38:38.337 --> 01:38:38.377]  He
[01:38:40.342 --> 01:38:50.889]  was a graduate of Yale University and had joined the Marine Corps during the war and lost an eye in the Pacific fighting.
[01:38:52.110 --> 01:39:09.302]  I think that LBJ settled on Meyer as an opportunist parent like himself a parent and a man who had very little left to him in life ever since
[01:39:10.231 --> 01:39:17.078]  JFK had taken Kord's wife as one of his mistresses.
[01:39:17.098 --> 01:39:29.109]  I would suggest that Kord Meier welcomed the approach from LBJ, who was, after all, only the Vice President at that time.
[01:39:29.847 --> 01:39:36.890]  Of course, could not number Cord Meier among JFK's admirers.
[01:39:37.371 --> 01:39:38.651]  Quite the contrary.
[01:39:39.411 --> 01:39:44.094]  As for Dave Phillips, I knew him pretty well at one time.
[01:39:44.114 --> 01:39:49.716]  He worked for me during the Guatemala Project.
[01:39:50.016 --> 01:39:58.000]  He had made himself useful to the agency in Santiago, Chile, where he was an American businessman.
[01:39:58.559 --> 01:40:25.627]  In any case, his actions, whatever they were, came to the attention of the Santiago Station Chief, and when his resume became known to people in the Western Hemisphere Division, he was brought in to work on Guatemalan operations.
[01:40:26.892 --> 01:40:40.239]  Bruce and Morales and people of that yoke stayed in apartment houses during preparations for the big event.
[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:47.543]  Their addresses were very subject to change so that
[01:40:48.743 --> 01:40:57.470]  Where a fellow like Wallace had been one day, you're not necessarily associated with that same address the following day.
[01:40:58.391 --> 01:41:01.914]  In short, it was a very mobile experience.
[01:41:03.115 --> 01:41:18.227]  Let me point out at this point that if I had wanted to fictionalize what went on in Miami and elsewhere during the run-up for the big event, I would have done so.
[01:41:19.221 --> 01:41:29.851]  But I don't want any unreality to tinge at this particular story or the information I should say.
[01:41:30.952 --> 01:41:36.637]  I was a bench warmer on it and I had a reputation for honesty.
[01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:44.244]  I think it's essential to refocus on what this information that I've been providing you
[01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:48.791]  And you alone, by the way, consists of.
[01:41:49.271 --> 01:42:08.819]  What is important in the story is that we backtracked the chain of command up through Kordmeier and laying the doings at the doorstep of LBJ.
[01:42:09.599 --> 01:42:13.861]  He, in my opinion, had an almost maniacal
[01:42:16.089 --> 01:42:17.390]  to become president.
[01:42:17.450 --> 01:42:25.435]  He regarded JFK as he was in fact an obstacle to achieving that.
[01:42:26.676 --> 01:42:33.420]  He could have waited for JFK to finish out his term and then undoubtedly a second term.
[01:42:34.021 --> 01:42:43.107]  So that would have put LBJ at the head of a long list of people who were waiting for some change in the executive branch.
[01:42:46.036 --> 01:42:55.212]  Now I learned of this tape a few weeks ago, but by then I heard he was going to go on Ian Punnin and George Norris, so I just held off because I don't want to scoop those guys.
[01:42:55.253 --> 01:42:58.398]  They had him scheduled first, but we appreciate
[01:43:00.859 --> 01:43:04.201]  Mr. Hunt letting us play that clip that you just heard.
[01:43:04.241 --> 01:43:17.187]  And again, he said in the next few days, maybe even today, up on his website that we have links to up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the guest section today, he will be releasing the other 15 minutes of the tape.
[01:43:19.468 --> 01:43:28.193]  But understand, we have the photos of E. Howard Hunt there, side by side with other known top FBI, excuse me, CIA operatives.
[01:43:28.962 --> 01:43:32.383]  We're also a bunch of top FBI guys running around, and then they've been photographed.
[01:43:32.643 --> 01:43:33.723]  I mean, spitting images.
[01:43:34.583 --> 01:43:39.204]  We then have the mistress of LBJ, LBJ's lawyer, and all the other evidence.
[01:43:40.144 --> 01:43:56.467]  But this isn't where you can't get three shots off with a type of rifle through a tree, or hundreds of witnesses saw plumes of smoke and tramps back there shooting guns, or, you know, the guy in the railway saw this and they killed him, or on and on and on.
[01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:02.091]  It's the actual lawyer of LBJ.
[01:44:02.431 --> 01:44:14.555]  It's the mistress of LBJ, the admitted lawyer, the admitted mistress, the admitted high-level CIA operative who ran the operation with Ardennes in Guatemala and that overthrow and many other overthrows.
[01:44:14.936 --> 01:44:18.517]  I mean, this was a CIA black-op commander, folks.
[01:44:19.742 --> 01:44:30.686]  He was picked up by the police behind the railway station, but then the higher-ups, of course, were in on it with Jack Ruby and others and said, wink, wink, release him.
[01:44:31.446 --> 01:44:32.646]  It's just off the charts.
[01:44:34.367 --> 01:44:37.948]  Absolutely off the charts to have this.
[01:44:38.328 --> 01:44:39.768]  And does it get media attention?
[01:44:40.209 --> 01:44:40.429]  No.
[01:44:40.909 --> 01:44:44.570]  It's the cover of the Rolling Stone, yes, but still, a few million people might read that.
[01:44:45.217 --> 01:44:49.922]  It gets picked up on Coast to Coast AM which is mainstream but really alternative in its format.
[01:44:50.603 --> 01:44:51.584]  It's on this show.
[01:44:51.724 --> 01:44:56.049]  We write an article about it and it gets 500 digs on Dig.
[01:44:56.109 --> 01:45:02.036]  Millions will have seen it but they didn't because they have the censor brigade admitting anything we put out is censored.
[01:45:02.056 --> 01:45:05.200]  I mean we had New York police
[01:45:06.342 --> 01:45:11.265]  Walking up and saying, we know you don't have bombs, but we're going to put you in a hole saying you do unless you stop your free speech.
[01:45:11.785 --> 01:45:17.708]  Huge news, but it got up on the main page and then people got on there and digged it down and laughed and said, we're censoring you.
[01:45:18.208 --> 01:45:21.410]  They're celebrating that they get to censor all our stories.
[01:45:24.011 --> 01:45:32.616]  And again, the problem is, Dig, which is hundreds of times bigger than Drudge, advertises that it's free speech and that what people want gets put on the main page.
[01:45:32.696 --> 01:45:33.176]  It's not true.
[01:45:33.763 --> 01:45:42.485]  They have an internal Dig Brigade who have higher experience rates and precedent than anybody else, and one of them can dig down a thousand digs, basically.
[01:45:43.325 --> 01:45:46.545]  It's shameful, it's disgusting, and it's false advertising by Dig.
[01:45:47.445 --> 01:45:53.346]  And I suggest everybody get mad about this and get up there and ram down their doors and take our stories and dig them right to the top.
[01:45:54.447 --> 01:45:55.567]  That way the truth gets out.
[01:45:56.647 --> 01:45:59.908]  I mean, why did Dig dig down the JFK story we posted?
[01:46:00.828 --> 01:46:02.208]  No one else had done an article since
[01:46:03.437 --> 01:46:05.278]  No one had done an article about the new Hunt Tape.
[01:46:05.699 --> 01:46:16.005]  There's been a story in the Rolling Stone about the previous stuff a month ago, but we wrote an article Sunday, it was out Monday, it went up on Dig, and it was blocked within minutes.
[01:46:16.705 --> 01:46:19.687]  Blocked within minutes, never to be seen by the people on there.
[01:46:20.568 --> 01:46:22.549]  And it's the same thing with all these other big websites.
[01:46:23.209 --> 01:46:26.031]  And they advertise that it's free speech.
[01:46:26.211 --> 01:46:27.172]  It is not!
[01:46:28.371 --> 01:46:31.193]  So let's go in there and let's take over and let's stop them.
[01:46:31.233 --> 01:46:32.294]  Go get the JFK story.
[01:46:32.314 --> 01:46:35.656]  It's on the right hand side of PrisonPlanet.com and the news in focus.
[01:46:36.536 --> 01:46:38.017]  Go get the other articles we put out.
[01:46:38.057 --> 01:46:39.618]  I mean, look at these articles we've got today.
[01:46:39.638 --> 01:46:45.262]  I mean, listen to this article, okay?
[01:46:47.223 --> 01:46:48.604]  Everybody needs to see this.
[01:46:48.684 --> 01:46:52.927]  We wrote an article about Zbigniew Brzezinski by February 6th.
[01:46:53.427 --> 01:46:54.147]  It was February 1st.
[01:46:55.615 --> 01:47:09.683]  Armed Services Committee, Zbigniew Brzezinski, former National Security Advisor, founder of our Lateral Commission, the guy that wrote up the plans that were put into PENAC, saying that the government may stage a terror attack to be blamed on Iran to start a war.
[01:47:10.624 --> 01:47:11.464]  I mean, he said that!
[01:47:13.105 --> 01:47:16.607]  And it goes up on Digg, and it gets blocked and censored, and no one sees it.
[01:47:18.628 --> 01:47:19.169]  Almost no one.
[01:47:20.726 --> 01:47:21.727]  Just like this one won't.
[01:47:21.947 --> 01:47:26.932]  We have an avenue where if their advertising was true, the people would see this, but it won't be.
[01:47:26.972 --> 01:47:28.253]  Today, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:47:28.633 --> 01:47:29.474]  Are you going to go get it?
[01:47:29.574 --> 01:47:31.236]  Are you going to go aggressively take action?
[01:47:31.556 --> 01:47:37.081]  Are you guys and gals going to join each other and add each other to your friends list so you can all see who you're swarming?
[01:47:37.922 --> 01:47:41.645]  Will you put the energy in to take action to get this news out and stop a terror attack?
[01:47:42.166 --> 01:47:46.430]  CFR warns of false flag attack to ignite Iran war.
[01:47:47.871 --> 01:48:04.254]  Echoing Brzezinski's veiled threat, but absurdly pins potential blame on Al-Qaeda, the CFR has echoed the warning of Zbigniew Brzezinski in claiming that a possible false flag terror attack blamed on Iran could be used to ignite a war, but absurdly pins the potential blame on Al-Qaeda, and not
[01:48:05.382 --> 01:48:09.964]  The most likely perpetrator is the military-industrial complex that owns and controls the United States government.
[01:48:10.364 --> 01:48:22.589]  The CFR, along with the Trilateral Commission, told the real strings of power in the United States, an act on policy directed upon by the Big Brother, Multinational, Semi-Secret Steering Societies, the Bilderberg Group, and others.
[01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:25.150]  The commissions.
[01:48:26.670 --> 01:48:30.232]  In an article for the May-June issue of Council on Foreign Relations, Foreign Affairs,
[01:48:31.112 --> 01:48:33.194]  Periodical entitled, Al-Qaeda Strikes Back.
[01:48:33.554 --> 01:48:37.858]  CFR member, 29 page CIA operative, Bruce Riddell writes.
[01:48:37.878 --> 01:48:40.620]  29 year CIA operative, Bruce Riddell writes.
[01:48:41.021 --> 01:48:42.582]  You better be afraid, very afraid, folks.
[01:48:42.602 --> 01:48:43.843]  Last time they did this, we got hit.
[01:48:44.804 --> 01:48:49.488]  The biggest danger is that Al-Qaeda will deliberately provoke a war with a false flag operation.
[01:48:49.868 --> 01:48:51.290]  That's, I mean, come on.
[01:48:51.890 --> 01:48:53.752]  That's the CFR using that term.
[01:48:54.172 --> 01:48:55.033]  Shut up, punks.
[01:48:55.945 --> 01:49:06.694]  The biggest danger is that the Al-Qaeda will deliberately provoke a war with false flag operation, say a terrorist attack carried out in a way that would make it appear as though it were Iran doing it.
[01:49:07.075 --> 01:49:14.481]  The United States would be extremely wary of such a deception in the event of an attack accurately assisting in assigning blame
[01:49:16.756 --> 01:49:19.259]  ...will require very careful intelligence work.
[01:49:19.319 --> 01:49:26.586]  It may require months or even years of patient investigating to identify the plotters behind well-placed and well-executed operations.
[01:49:27.578 --> 01:49:28.358]  So, there you go.
[01:49:28.398 --> 01:49:31.840]  The CFR says Al-Qaeda is going to stage attacks to go into Iran.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:33.401]  Which, in a way, is true.
[01:49:33.561 --> 01:49:35.982]  Our government, Zbigniew Brzezinski, founded Al-Qaeda.
[01:49:36.282 --> 01:49:37.742]  Al-Qaeda is CIA.
[01:49:38.243 --> 01:49:42.044]  It is their envelope, envelope group, their cloaking device.
[01:49:42.064 --> 01:49:43.285]  And so, in a way, that's true.
[01:49:43.585 --> 01:49:45.646]  Al-Qaeda did attack us because they hate our freedoms.
[01:49:46.206 --> 01:49:49.247]  Just Al-Qaeda is not Muslims, like you were told, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:49.728 --> 01:49:51.148]  Oh, it's some Muslim front people.
[01:49:51.668 --> 01:49:52.269]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:56.881 --> 01:50:02.348]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:10.299]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.047 --> 01:50:18.109]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.490 --> 01:50:29.933]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.233 --> 01:50:33.795]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.195 --> 01:50:36.135]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.456 --> 01:50:40.297]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.503 --> 01:51:03.569]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:03.810 --> 01:51:15.057]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:15.378 --> 01:51:20.201]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,

[01:51:53.539 --> 01:51:55.260]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:59.181]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.501 --> 01:52:01.722]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:52:02.223 --> 01:52:08.445]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.585 --> 01:52:13.467]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.687 --> 01:52:22.712]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[01:52:23.052 --> 01:52:29.015]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.
[01:52:29.735 --> 01:52:30.556]  Well, you were sleeping
[01:52:59.745 --> 01:53:12.492]  Yeah, a huge report like this, the Council on Foreign Relations, that said there'll be big terror attacks soon and we'll take all your rights.
[01:53:20.863 --> 01:53:23.465]  And the attack comes and they go, see we fooled you!
[01:53:23.485 --> 01:53:28.189]  Well they're saying Al-Qaeda could stage a black ops so we attack Iran.
[01:53:29.650 --> 01:53:29.790]  Awww!
[01:53:30.191 --> 01:53:31.532]  Which is actually true in a way!
[01:53:33.193 --> 01:53:48.045]  Pretty big news up on PrisonPlanet.com I want to get to all your calls here but we've got this guest coming up as well and at the same time the biggest most successful thing we do in the fight against the New World Order is my films.
[01:53:50.237 --> 01:54:02.446]  And then it's not just Terror Storm or Road to Tyranny or Marshall Law or Police State 2000 or all the films that I've made that are available at InfoWars.com on the SecureSafe video and bookstore shopping cart.
[01:54:03.026 --> 01:54:13.113]  It's also all the other videos like 9-11 Press for Truth, Mind Control by Nick Begich, America Freedom to Fascism by Aaron Russo, Iraq for Sale,
[01:54:15.524 --> 01:54:18.406]  Riddles and Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C.
[01:54:18.486 --> 01:54:21.669]  I mean, the newest, most important, most informative.
[01:54:21.689 --> 01:54:23.570]  I mean, I get sent a lot of baloney, and we don't carry it.
[01:54:24.071 --> 01:54:25.252]  We only carry the best stuff.
[01:54:25.292 --> 01:54:30.796]  By the way, going up in the next few hours in the shopping cart, we just got a man debunking the 9-11 debunkers by David and Ray Griffin.
[01:54:31.216 --> 01:54:36.240]  We're going to have that discounted with the video documentary film about him that we also carry.
[01:54:37.581 --> 01:54:44.206]  The point is, there's a lot of good stuff at Infowars.com, and when you purchase it from us, you make what we do here possible.
[01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:51.312]  And frankly, I've got a lot of big projects I want to do that I know will be very effective against the New World Order.
[01:54:52.393 --> 01:55:02.959]  And we need your support, so if you want to be in the front lines with us, a great way to do it is financially, and that means having a PrisonPlanet.tv 15-cent-a-day membership, doesn't sound like a lot, it is, together.
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:09.903]  Or buying Terror Storm, or America Freedom to Fascism, or debunking the 9-11 debunkers.
[01:55:11.804 --> 01:55:13.526]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:14.930 --> 01:55:15.190]  Hello Alex.
[01:55:15.210 --> 01:55:15.891]  I'm a first time caller.
[01:55:44.441 --> 01:55:47.122]  I'm a disabled Marine from the Vietnam era.
[01:55:47.882 --> 01:55:48.342]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:48.362 --> 01:55:50.763]  And also an ex-police officer.
[01:55:51.483 --> 01:56:00.466]  And I would like to congratulate you for everything you have done and let you know we're winning.
[01:56:02.266 --> 01:56:06.508]  I've been woke up since 9-11.
[01:56:06.848 --> 01:56:12.530]  Since the day of 9-11 when Building 7 fell, I knew something was up.
[01:56:12.570 --> 01:56:13.970]  And all the people that
[01:56:14.736 --> 01:56:26.786]  I've been ostracized from VFW and Marine Corps League for speaking my mind and I'd like to challenge all veterans out there to speak up.
[01:56:29.208 --> 01:56:32.611]  The people that used to argue with me now just put their head down and walk off.
[01:56:33.492 --> 01:56:34.593]  So we are winning.
[01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:38.021]  And I'd like to thank you for that.
[01:56:38.261 --> 01:56:39.422]  Well, I'd like to thank you, sir.
[01:56:39.442 --> 01:56:40.842]  I'd like to thank you for our service.
[01:56:40.862 --> 01:56:47.887]  I mean, there's so many good people like you that think they're serving the country and end up getting used, but it's painful to admit you've been conned.
[01:56:47.907 --> 01:56:49.428]  But I've been conned and used before.
[01:56:49.468 --> 01:56:53.530]  It's better, though, to be man enough or woman enough to admit to it.
[01:56:53.590 --> 01:56:55.831]  I don't dislike any of our military or our police.
[01:56:55.912 --> 01:56:57.492]  I know they're salt-of-the-earth people.
[01:56:57.913 --> 01:57:00.094]  They've just been brainwashed, just like the public.
[01:57:00.774 --> 01:57:02.796]  And look at the people launching this new war.
[01:57:03.336 --> 01:57:05.657]  And they're the ones getting rid of our country.
[01:57:05.677 --> 01:57:06.618]  I mean, it's really simple.
[01:57:07.666 --> 01:57:13.089]  Yes it is and the police have just went completely nuts.
[01:57:13.909 --> 01:57:20.432]  I've been harassed because I did a lot of writing to the editor.
[01:57:21.078 --> 01:57:23.799]  I live in the middle of Rush Limbaugh country.
[01:57:23.939 --> 01:57:24.699]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:57:24.719 --> 01:57:26.580]  I'm going to let you finish up and then let's get St.
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:28.861]  John on at about the three after.
[01:57:28.921 --> 01:57:33.383]  Go ahead and get him on the line in the next few minutes and then we're going to, but I want our caller to finish up.
[01:57:33.663 --> 01:57:38.245]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.824 --> 01:57:54.027]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.688 --> 01:57:55.488]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.249 --> 01:57:57.169]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.810 --> 01:58:01.472]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.993 --> 01:58:06.116]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.297 --> 01:58:10.819]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to have St.
[01:58:10.879 --> 01:58:17.304]  John Hunt, the son of the CIA Black Hawk commander, E. Howard Hunt, about the assassination of JFK.
[01:58:19.625 --> 01:58:22.209]  Forty-something years later, you want an eyewitness?
[01:58:22.229 --> 01:58:24.131]  You want somebody commanding the trigger op?
[01:58:24.973 --> 01:58:26.034]  You're gonna get it.
[01:58:26.274 --> 01:58:28.097]  I mean, this is just off the charts.
[01:58:28.858 --> 01:58:29.739]  We've already proven it.
[01:58:29.799 --> 01:58:34.606]  Ninety-plus percent of the public now know, but the mainstream media still calls us grassy and old nuts.
[01:58:35.914 --> 01:58:44.960]  Okay, I guess we're nuts because the world's round and we say water's wet and birds fly, but the facts are the facts, New World Order, and your black ops been exposed.
[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:45.720]  We appreciate St.
[01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:46.360]  John joining us.
[01:58:46.761 --> 01:58:47.321]  He's coming up.
[01:58:47.981 --> 01:58:59.749]  Roger in Missouri is a former Marine Corps veteran, well, is a Marine Corps veteran, a former police officer, and he was saying that he had written letters to the editor about what's happening in our society and that he got harassed.
[01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:01.169]  Tell us about that, Roger.
[01:59:04.418 --> 01:59:13.882]  I live in a small community close to where Rush Limbaugh is from, and the local newspaper is owned by friends of the Limbaughs.
[01:59:15.162 --> 01:59:20.244]  Actually, the editor in my local newspaper, I think, left because he was printing my articles.
[01:59:21.724 --> 01:59:23.065]  They will not print them anymore.
[01:59:23.125 --> 01:59:26.846]  I've sent in probably ten, and they just throw them away.
[01:59:26.886 --> 01:59:31.048]  But I've had about four or five brushes with the law.
[01:59:31.889 --> 01:59:39.133]  And since I was a former police officer, I know the law, and anybody that didn't know the law would have probably went to jail, but I didn't.
[01:59:39.374 --> 01:59:42.956]  So, they're on now, and they started on my youngest son.
[01:59:42.976 --> 01:59:44.397]  What was happening to you?
[01:59:44.437 --> 01:59:48.319]  I mean, when they pull you over, like, how would they get in your business?
[01:59:48.879 --> 02:00:01.387]  Yeah, for instance, my wife, I bought my wife a new car, and they put some temporary tags on the windshield, back windshield, and we just came into town, and they pulled my wife over,
[02:00:02.222 --> 02:00:03.883]  And said that they couldn't see this.
[02:00:04.444 --> 02:00:07.106]  And of course, they checked everything out and everything was just fine.
[02:00:07.166 --> 02:00:09.828]  And he was talking to my wife for a while.
[02:00:09.848 --> 02:00:13.610]  She was back and he looked over at me and he said, uh, sir, do you have an ID?
[02:00:14.191 --> 02:00:15.231]  And I said, yes.
[02:00:15.331 --> 02:00:16.332]  And he said, could I see it?
[02:00:16.492 --> 02:00:21.236]  And I went through the thing about probable cause and was I acting suspicious and all that.
[02:00:21.796 --> 02:00:24.718]  And before I knew it, there was four, four police cars there.
[02:00:25.459 --> 02:00:27.320]  And I wasn't acting intimidated or anything.
[02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:30.142]  I just told them I knew my rights, that I hadn't done anything.
[02:00:30.999 --> 02:00:34.921]  And when I said, I will tell you my name, but I'm not going to show you anything.
[02:00:34.981 --> 02:00:37.182]  I don't have to carry papers yet in this country.
[02:00:37.922 --> 02:00:42.244]  And he said, oh yeah, you're the one who writes all those articles to the newspaper.
[02:00:42.284 --> 02:00:43.344]  He said, you're a troublemaker.
[02:00:44.165 --> 02:00:46.006]  I said, well, you know, whatever.
[02:00:46.066 --> 02:00:47.186]  And they let us go.
[02:00:47.206 --> 02:00:56.170]  And two or three different times they pulled me over just supposedly to check my insurance or my driver's license or whatever.
[02:00:56.230 --> 02:00:57.771]  And they know perfectly well who I am.
[02:00:57.791 --> 02:00:58.811]  I went to school with them.
[02:00:59.352 --> 02:01:01.513]  The Chief of Police, and I know the Sheriff real well.
[02:01:01.753 --> 02:01:03.874]  And aren't these guys ashamed of themselves?
[02:01:03.894 --> 02:01:06.935]  I mean, this is how pathetic, this is not how America operates.
[02:01:07.295 --> 02:01:07.736]  Correct.
[02:01:08.416 --> 02:01:18.920]  And I've noticed that I have your bumper stickers on all my vehicles since 9-11 was inside Job and I've had four people say, ain't you afraid of getting shot?
[02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:20.181]  Drive around with that on there.
[02:01:21.361 --> 02:01:25.463]  And I can't believe that people are as afraid
[02:01:26.167 --> 02:01:26.767]  As they are now.
[02:01:26.807 --> 02:01:28.228]  They're actually afraid.
[02:01:28.288 --> 02:01:32.971]  I've talked to a lot of people, and they agree with everything I say, but they are afraid to speak up.
[02:01:33.772 --> 02:01:35.193]  You know, I don't understand it.
[02:01:35.693 --> 02:01:38.555]  Whenever something scares me, I fight it, and then I get over the fear.
[02:01:38.675 --> 02:01:40.196]  I couldn't imagine giving into fear.
[02:01:41.557 --> 02:01:42.277]  That's me.
[02:01:43.358 --> 02:01:55.006]  I've sort of been a rebel all my life, and I was involved with the Nixon White House a little bit when I was in the Marine Corps.
[02:01:56.255 --> 02:01:58.396]  I was there when the POWs came home.
[02:01:58.496 --> 02:02:00.037]  I seen McCain get off the plane.
[02:02:01.638 --> 02:02:10.444]  I hauled Nixon's secretary and such, because Mr. Nixon's Western White House was right out the back gate of Camp Pendleton.
[02:02:10.464 --> 02:02:12.585]  And I seen quite a few things going on.
[02:02:12.645 --> 02:02:13.786]  I talked to a lot of POWs.
[02:02:13.886 --> 02:02:21.651]  I hauled them and their families around and knew things that wasn't kosher with Senator McCain.
[02:02:22.288 --> 02:02:23.989]  You know, I'd like to have you on as a guest.
[02:02:24.409 --> 02:02:26.830]  Is it alright if I get your name and number, maybe have you on as a guest?
[02:02:26.850 --> 02:02:31.513]  You can send us, you know what, you can send us those letters to the editor, and we'll post them, my friend.
[02:02:31.953 --> 02:02:32.153]  Okay?
[02:02:32.173 --> 02:02:34.094]  I'm gonna put you on hold, get your name and number.
[02:02:34.674 --> 02:02:35.655]  Very interesting fella.
[02:02:36.155 --> 02:02:37.636]  And we'll be right back with St.
[02:02:37.676 --> 02:02:39.697]  John Hunt, who we're honored to have as a guest.
[02:02:40.057 --> 02:02:40.497]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.879 --> 02:02:48.762]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:02:49.122 --> 02:02:51.985]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:02:52.225 --> 02:02:58.410]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:03:54.195 --> 02:04:01.797]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.532 --> 02:04:09.598]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.978 --> 02:04:21.407]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.

[02:04:49.744 --> 02:04:54.567]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[02:05:45.655 --> 02:05:51.200]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.568 --> 02:06:01.828]  St.
[02:06:01.888 --> 02:06:22.641]  John Hunt is the eldest son of super-spy E. Howard Hunt, a 27-year career CIA covert agent and foreign station chief, most well-known as the leader-director of the White House Plumbers black-bag team, whose botched burglary and arrest led to the impeachment and resignation of the President Richard Milhouse Nixon.
[02:06:23.576 --> 02:06:47.274]  And E. Howard Hunt, who passed away in January at the age of 88, was also involved in many of the CIA's most nefarious operations in Cuba and throughout Central and South America, including, but not limited to, the assassination of Che Guevara, assassination, and it just goes on and on, of people in Chile, the coup in Guatemala, the orchestration of the Bay of Pigs, and the plots to assassinate Fidel Castro.
[02:06:47.314 --> 02:06:50.977]  So he was a black ops master, would be my term,
[02:06:52.382 --> 02:06:54.783]  And I just had a chance to talk to Mr. Hunt.
[02:06:54.843 --> 02:06:55.003]  St.
[02:06:55.023 --> 02:06:56.404]  James Hunt is all the sun during the break.
[02:06:56.444 --> 02:07:02.426]  I'm flattered to learn that he is a listener and a reader of the website and we're honored to have him.
[02:07:02.546 --> 02:07:04.547]  Last hour we aired that five minutes.
[02:07:05.007 --> 02:07:07.468]  Fifteen more minutes is going to be going up on the site very, very soon.
[02:07:07.488 --> 02:07:08.788]  He's authorized us to play that.
[02:07:09.128 --> 02:07:10.629]  I'll have him back up when we do that.
[02:07:11.029 --> 02:07:12.610]  But it's happening in our lifetime.
[02:07:12.710 --> 02:07:15.531]  Forty-three years and some change later.
[02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:22.142]  You want somebody who was there, somebody who was quote, on the bench as a commander.
[02:07:22.762 --> 02:07:24.002]  That's E. Howard Hunt.
[02:07:25.303 --> 02:07:28.444]  And that's the info we've gotten from Jim Mars and other experts.
[02:07:28.484 --> 02:07:30.464]  That's the info we've gotten from photographs.
[02:07:30.504 --> 02:07:36.386]  That's the info I got from the mistress, Madeline Duncan Brown, and the lawyer, Barr McClellan.
[02:07:36.446 --> 02:07:38.426]  I mean, we have it now in triplicate.
[02:07:38.747 --> 02:07:40.127]  We have a commander of the op,
[02:07:40.934 --> 02:07:47.885]  One of the commanders of the op, they always have multiple commanders, these things are always overlaid for redundancy and safety to make sure the op's carried out.
[02:07:48.827 --> 02:07:53.094]  We have the mistress, we have the lawyer, then we have all the circumstantial and physical evidence and the motive.
[02:07:53.857 --> 02:07:56.238]  It's absolutely off the charts, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:56.558 --> 02:08:00.759]  And so, without further ado, I wanted to welcome to the airwaves St.
[02:08:00.819 --> 02:08:01.480]  John Hunt.
[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:04.921]  The website is stjohnhunt.com.
[02:08:05.181 --> 02:08:09.302]  We have links up on infowars.com to his website right now.
[02:08:09.742 --> 02:08:10.743]  And we are honored to have him.
[02:08:10.763 --> 02:08:11.603]  Thank you for coming on, sir.
[02:08:12.003 --> 02:08:13.124]  Well, thank you, Alex, for having me.
[02:08:13.164 --> 02:08:14.044]  I'm looking forward to this.
[02:08:15.752 --> 02:08:26.125]  I certainly hope you get a publisher for the book you've written, because let me tell you, this is already dynamite and incendiary material, but isn't it surprising that you haven't found one quite yet?
[02:08:27.041 --> 02:08:31.846]  Well, you know, I don't know if it's surprising or not.
[02:08:32.606 --> 02:08:38.352]  The media is still probably reeling from the backlash as a result of the Oliver Stone JFK movie.
[02:08:38.932 --> 02:08:43.356]  I think that stung and certainly opened up a lot of people's eyes.
[02:08:45.798 --> 02:08:52.241]  The pendulum swings both ways, and so I think we're still probably in the very tail end of a backlash against that.
[02:08:52.281 --> 02:09:06.707]  And of course, all of the great researchers, the people who have devoted their lives to researching this terrible tragedy, this national tragedy, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, have been blackballed.
[02:09:06.727 --> 02:09:09.948]  They've been labeled as kooks, as nuts, as psychos.
[02:09:10.580 --> 02:09:18.313]  you know by the right wing media and uh... you know i think our day is is common i think this is close to a smoking gun is where we're going to get
[02:09:19.273 --> 02:09:19.813]  I agree.
[02:09:19.853 --> 02:09:20.714]  Again, we're talking to St.
[02:09:20.754 --> 02:09:26.355]  John Hunt, the eldest son of E. Howard Hunt, with what he believed was a deathbed confession.
[02:09:26.435 --> 02:09:33.538]  He thought he was going to die three years ago and then gave this tape to his son, but then did die in January at the ripe old age of 88.
[02:09:33.778 --> 02:09:37.239]  He obviously believed he was a patriot for this country.
[02:09:37.279 --> 02:09:38.379]  There's so much to talk about.
[02:09:38.659 --> 02:09:42.681]  Your mother's there demanding more money from Nixon so you guys can defend yourselves.
[02:09:42.941 --> 02:09:43.981]  Her plane blows up.
[02:09:44.281 --> 02:09:46.802]  Well, it started for me when I was 16 years old.
[02:09:46.822 --> 02:09:48.383]  My mother and my father sat me down.
[02:10:02.601 --> 02:10:20.375]  And very calmly told me that my father, in fact, was not a State Department employee, that the certificates of commendation that he carried on his office wall at our home were, in fact, forgeries supplied to him by his true employer, which was the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:10:20.875 --> 02:10:23.658]  And for me, that's when it really all began.
[02:10:24.925 --> 02:10:33.747]  Prior to that, I was just a very confused child, living a gypsy-like existence, being dragged from one country to another.
[02:10:33.827 --> 02:10:38.808]  By the time I was nine or ten, I had already lived in Tokyo, Japan.
[02:10:38.868 --> 02:10:45.029]  I spoke rudimentary Japanese, then I moved to Latin America, to Monterrey, Uruguay, for four years.
[02:10:45.509 --> 02:10:50.810]  I attended a French school down there, so I was pretty confused by the time I was sixteen.
[02:10:50.890 --> 02:10:54.211]  I lived in Mexico City, Madrid, Spain, Paris, France.
[02:10:54.611 --> 02:11:02.917]  And finally, in this country, so I was kind of the oddball at school, you know, never had any friends, never integrated into a social pattern.
[02:11:03.938 --> 02:11:11.783]  So when they told me, well, this is why your life is like this, it was with some, you know, some shock.
[02:11:12.163 --> 02:11:21.650]  I didn't really understand what the CIA was at the time, and it wasn't until 1972 when my father came home on the night of the DNC break-in, when the four-man Cuban
[02:11:23.092 --> 02:11:23.812]  Absolutely.
[02:11:23.973 --> 02:11:28.098]  You began talking to your father years ago about the Kennedy situation.
[02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:42.100]  Thank you.
[02:11:55.154 --> 02:12:15.329]  Well, my first inclination about any speculation or any allegation that my father was involved in the John F. Kennedy assassination came after, well, it was when my father was in prison for Watergate and I was
[02:12:17.945 --> 02:12:44.266]  uh... making a phone call from a phone booth and lo and behold on a telephone pole right next to the phone booth was a large black-and-white poster saying CIA killed JFK and right below that bold lettering were three photos two of my father and one of a uh... someone that looked very much like my father although he had a crumpled hat on and was somewhat dirty in the face and this was one of these uh... three tramps that have been photographed in Dallas November 22, 1963
[02:12:46.327 --> 02:12:51.171]  I tore that poster off and I just stared at it in a state of shock and stunned disbelief.
[02:12:51.191 --> 02:12:55.094]  So that was really the beginning of my quest for the truth about that.
[02:12:55.834 --> 02:13:04.141]  Of course, my father was released from prison, moved to Guadalajara, Mexico, where he was out of this country.
[02:13:05.131 --> 02:13:07.152]  Out of reach for me.
[02:13:07.252 --> 02:13:16.074]  Anyways, I did visit him several times over the years, but we never really got down to the nitty-gritty until he summoned me down.
[02:13:16.834 --> 02:13:18.415]  He had been in the hospital for 19 months.
[02:13:18.455 --> 02:13:19.855]  He'd had two leg amputations.
[02:13:19.895 --> 02:13:21.076]  He'd had cancer of the jaw.
[02:13:21.136 --> 02:13:22.276]  He had prostate cancer.
[02:13:22.336 --> 02:13:27.517]  He had lupus and pleurisy, pneumonia.
[02:13:27.537 --> 02:13:28.498]  I mean, the list went on and on.
[02:13:28.538 --> 02:13:29.518]  He was very, very sick.
[02:13:29.918 --> 02:13:31.979]  We're talking Darth Vader level here.
[02:13:32.039 --> 02:13:33.260]  He's had quite a bit of work.
[02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:35.081]  Yeah, quite a bit of work.
[02:13:36.942 --> 02:13:53.112]  He summoned me down and for all intents and purposes it was my last visit to him and he told me that he had information that was very important to him to give to me and that I should do with it as I see fit.
[02:13:54.052 --> 02:13:58.415]  Once he was moved from the hospital bed at the hospital to his home in Miami,
[02:13:59.356 --> 02:14:19.734]  We had a number of occasions when there was no one else in the house where he hand wrote out four or five pages of extensive memos detailing the characters, the people that were involved in that plot to assassinate John F. Kennedy, and he told me there was probably a lot of, you know, there was talk in a lot of circles
[02:14:20.194 --> 02:14:33.398]  The backrooms of Miami and elsewhere where there was people trying to organize a coup against President Kennedy as he was thought to have been selling this country down and soft on communism.
[02:14:33.478 --> 02:14:35.938]  So he gave me those memos.
[02:14:36.018 --> 02:14:38.039]  I returned back home to California.
[02:14:38.719 --> 02:14:49.786]  And about a month later, in January 2004, I go to my mailbox to pick up my mail and there's an overnight postal packet in it from my father and I opened it up.
[02:14:49.846 --> 02:14:58.291]  It was a single cassette where he was discussing the information about the John F. Kennedy assassination.
[02:14:59.272 --> 02:15:06.239]  And then pretty much supporting everything he had written down in the handwritten memos that he had supplied to me earlier in the year.
[02:15:13.980 --> 02:15:14.661]  We're good to go.
[02:15:32.083 --> 02:15:35.204]  By the way, I know you've got copies everywhere because you're in danger, buddy.
[02:15:35.224 --> 02:15:36.965]  Oh yeah, they're incriminated everywhere.
[02:15:37.045 --> 02:15:37.685]  That's smart.
[02:15:38.266 --> 02:15:41.747]  And I'm glad you're starting to dole this stuff out and get it out.
[02:15:41.767 --> 02:15:44.468]  That's a smart way to get as much attention as possible for your safety.
[02:15:44.488 --> 02:15:45.549]  This is key, what you're doing.
[02:15:45.889 --> 02:15:47.970]  Obviously, you know that better than I.
[02:15:48.910 --> 02:15:53.073]  And for people to understand how big this is, Kevin Costner offered millions for this.
[02:15:53.493 --> 02:16:00.478]  Kevin Costner, who you've spoken with, physically visited your father in Florida and tried to get this information from him.
[02:16:00.538 --> 02:16:02.799]  Can you briefly tell folks that story?
[02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:06.301]  Well, that's kind of a very interesting story.
[02:16:10.243 --> 02:16:15.245]  My father and Kevin Costner have a mutual friend, although Costner and my father had never spoken and never met.
[02:16:15.625 --> 02:16:18.586]  But this gentleman was a close friend of Kevin Costner's.
[02:16:18.626 --> 02:16:22.728]  I won't mention his name on the air in case he doesn't want to be linked to this.
[02:16:22.868 --> 02:16:25.589]  But anyways, he brought Kevin Costner down.
[02:16:25.889 --> 02:16:27.050]  There was some deceit going on.
[02:16:29.911 --> 02:16:31.372]  Deceit on Kevin Costner's part.
[02:16:31.572 --> 02:16:39.857]  Kevin Costner wanted to very much offer my dad a lot of money to come out with any information he might have known about JFK.
[02:16:40.557 --> 02:16:44.959]  At the time, nobody really knew what my dad knew because he hadn't told anybody yet.
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:54.685]  But anyways, Kevin Costner flies down and is introduced to my father by this mutual friend and Kevin just blurts out, so who killed JFK?
[02:16:55.705 --> 02:17:03.969]  My father was in his, you know, just his jaw dropped and he turned around and looked at his wife and said, what did he say?
[02:17:04.169 --> 02:17:10.191]  Yeah, that was, I mean, Kevin probably would have got it if he stayed in Miami two weeks and got to know him, but yeah, you can't just blurt it out.
[02:17:10.392 --> 02:17:19.115]  Yeah, and my father was under the impression at the time, very innocently, that Kevin Costner was coming down to talk about doing a movie script about my father's life.
[02:17:19.335 --> 02:17:20.416]  So the two,
[02:17:21.096 --> 02:17:26.118]  You know, what my father's impression of Kevin Costner was didn't match what Kevin Costner was down there for.
[02:17:26.218 --> 02:17:31.180]  So the whole thing just kind of blew up in its face and that was the end of that.
[02:17:31.461 --> 02:17:36.243]  Although we did contact Mr. Costner on the phone and we did try to negotiate some kind of arrangement.
[02:17:36.263 --> 02:17:36.963]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:17:37.023 --> 02:17:38.363]  Let's talk about that when we get back.
[02:17:38.403 --> 02:17:39.804]  Maybe you'll still do the movie now.
[02:17:40.144 --> 02:17:41.245]  This is so exciting.
[02:17:41.265 --> 02:17:41.865]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.740 --> 02:17:46.520]  Terrorism!
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:47.420]  Terrorism!
[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:53.582]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:17:53.842 --> 02:17:55.442]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:17:55.682 --> 02:17:58.163]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:17:58.543 --> 02:18:13.106]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:18:13.146 --> 02:18:13.466]  government.
[02:18:13.646 --> 02:18:15.366]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:18:15.826 --> 02:18:21.730]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:18:21.870 --> 02:18:26.353]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[02:19:04.182 --> 02:19:09.927]  There has been talk coming from the Council of Foreign Relations of forming an American Union combining Canada, Mexico and the U.S.
[02:19:10.027 --> 02:19:11.429]  and erasing economic borders.
[02:19:11.649 --> 02:19:18.415]  Bush met with Vincent Fox, President of Mexico, Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, discussing a security and prosperity partnership.
[02:19:18.615 --> 02:19:22.158]  The formation of a North American Union will have a great impact on the U.S.
[02:19:22.219 --> 02:19:22.719]  economy.
[02:19:22.959 --> 02:19:27.703]  Jerome R. Corsi published the document, The Plan to Replace the Dollar with the Emerald.
[02:19:27.924 --> 02:19:29.345]  The sovereignty of the U.S.
[02:19:29.605 --> 02:19:30.326]  is under attack.
[02:19:30.766 --> 02:19:34.147]  And Corsi uncovers the secrets and lies that surround the deceit.

[02:19:49.786 --> 02:19:52.607]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:19:52.967 --> 02:19:55.728]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?

[02:20:52.605 --> 02:20:54.706]  I certainly know what it takes to succeed.
[02:20:54.946 --> 02:21:00.387]  I also know without proper tools, your chance for significant income in the network marketing field can quickly fade.
[02:21:00.607 --> 02:21:06.568]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing will never spend the time nor money to develop the skills they need.

[02:21:52.047 --> 02:21:54.469]  John Hunt dot com.
[02:21:54.749 --> 02:21:55.710]  Excellent website.
[02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:58.092]  Filled with important information.
[02:21:58.112 --> 02:21:59.052]  This is a short segment.
[02:21:59.453 --> 02:22:01.154]  Long segment coming up and then one more.
[02:22:01.655 --> 02:22:04.597]  Plenty of time to talk about this important story with our guest.
[02:22:04.617 --> 02:22:06.959]  But I want to have him back up for another hour of the races.
[02:22:08.011 --> 02:22:12.896]  To discuss the longer tape he's going to be releasing and to maybe even take some of your phone calls.
[02:22:13.376 --> 02:22:13.617]  St.
[02:22:13.657 --> 02:22:14.898]  John Hunt continuing.
[02:22:15.398 --> 02:22:20.723]  You said you were talking to Kevin Costner over the phone later, still trying to work something out with him.
[02:22:21.304 --> 02:22:21.884]  Absolutely.
[02:22:21.904 --> 02:22:23.166]  Talk about being vindicated.
[02:22:23.466 --> 02:22:25.248]  Kevin Costner, what, making a documentary?
[02:22:25.268 --> 02:22:25.828]  A movie?
[02:22:26.128 --> 02:22:27.770]  I mean, what was he wanting to do at the time?
[02:22:27.810 --> 02:22:28.651]  What was he looking for?
[02:22:29.031 --> 02:22:41.402]  Well, what he was looking for, he wanted to, you know, he had gotten, he's kind of, in his own personal life, after he did the JFK movie for Oliver Stone, I guess he became somewhat of a conspiracy enthusiast.
[02:22:42.223 --> 02:22:46.847]  And so, when he was approached by the mutual friend,
[02:22:47.948 --> 02:22:50.431]  Yeah, I know E. Howard Hunt.
[02:22:50.531 --> 02:22:52.273]  Maybe he has some information.
[02:22:52.353 --> 02:22:55.497]  It's long been speculated that he may have done this or done that.
[02:22:55.598 --> 02:22:59.523]  So let's try to see if we can get him to disclose some information.
[02:22:59.583 --> 02:23:01.545]  Kevin was very enthusiastic about it.
[02:23:01.565 --> 02:23:03.688]  What he wanted to do was he wanted to film a documentary.
[02:23:04.531 --> 02:23:08.394]  He wanted to, uh, to have my father disclose, uh, whatever information.
[02:23:08.414 --> 02:23:11.196]  Well, first he wanted to find out if my father had any information.
[02:23:11.776 --> 02:23:16.260]  So, um, what we, what my father devised was a, uh, code key.
[02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:26.607]  A code and a key to, to, um, uh, to, uh, uh, to, to give Mr. Costner the relevant information, uh, without naming the names.
[02:23:26.867 --> 02:23:32.832]  So, uh, my father being a pretty smart and intellectually, uh, um, um, uh,
[02:23:33.676 --> 02:23:42.122]  Man, he developed this code that talked about the big event, which was the Kennedy assassination.
[02:23:42.342 --> 02:23:46.565]  That was what it was referred to during the planning stages of it in Miami, he told me.
[02:23:47.225 --> 02:23:58.113]  But he listed out a chain of command and a timeline series of events and things that took place along with all the most important players in the plot.
[02:23:58.573 --> 02:24:02.457]  Well, we provided this information to Kevin Costner and he said, well, this is dynamite stuff.
[02:24:02.517 --> 02:24:03.959]  We have to go with this.
[02:24:04.579 --> 02:24:08.003]  But you have to understand at the same time that as my father was recovering...
[02:24:09.304 --> 02:24:16.430]  From his illnesses, he's handled by what I call his own sort of Miami Mafia.
[02:24:16.890 --> 02:24:28.560]  And these are family members and attorneys whose job, at least they feel, is to, what they would, in their opinion, is protect my father.
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:32.563]  But from my point of view, it's to repress and suppress my father.
[02:24:32.583 --> 02:24:37.888]  Of course, my father still is under a secrecy agreement with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:24:38.408 --> 02:24:49.076]  And so now that his book has come out, American Spy, you know, that had to go through all kinds of scrutiny levels within the agency in order to be published.
[02:24:49.137 --> 02:24:57.223]  So by the time it was realized by my father's second family, by his wife and by the attorneys,
[02:24:57.743 --> 02:25:03.585]  You know, I hate to bring up your mother, but you talk about it in the Rolling Stone interview, and if you could elaborate, that would be very informative.
[02:25:17.738 --> 02:25:27.201]  Because the way it's described in the article is, you know, you guys needed money to live, you've been hung out to dry, she's going back to get more money from Nixon, and on her way back, the plane mysteriously has a problem.
[02:25:27.221 --> 02:25:28.022]  Can you tell us about that?
[02:25:28.782 --> 02:25:29.542]  Yeah, I can.
[02:25:30.062 --> 02:25:45.067]  From what I know, well, it's documented that my father was in jail at the time, and, you know, my mother had just returned from a summer vacation in Europe with the other children.
[02:25:47.646 --> 02:25:56.509]  She was in a position, and of her own free will I might add, she was the sort of quote-unquote bag lady for the Watergate.
[02:25:56.549 --> 02:26:05.652]  Now her responsibility was to make demands of the Nixon White House, to press for more funds for the Cuban families.
[02:26:05.672 --> 02:26:10.194]  There were the families of the four Cubans, the McCord family, and the Liddy family, and our family.
[02:26:10.214 --> 02:26:15.296]  So there was a lot of mouths to feed, there was a lot of attorney bills to pay, and she also
[02:26:16.076 --> 02:26:17.437]  What's going on?
[02:26:34.725 --> 02:26:48.096]  Uh, picking up, uh, you know, keys that, uh, that, uh, were placed underneath, uh, park benches and then going to Greyhound bus depots in the middle of the night, uh, dark parking lots, parked cars, uh, you know, picking up, uh,
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:27:05.727]  Um, money, undeclared slush fund money from the community re-elected president and traveling around and paying people off for their silence as well as the attorneys to continue the defending of all the Cubans and the other members who have been arrested.
[02:27:07.478 --> 02:27:11.600]  So she got on a plane to take some money to Chicago.
[02:27:11.620 --> 02:27:17.104]  There's several theories about what she was doing with that money.
[02:27:17.304 --> 02:27:17.884]  Tell you what, St.
[02:27:17.924 --> 02:27:18.524]  John, stay there.
[02:27:18.544 --> 02:27:28.550]  Let's come back and talk about that and talk about the book you're working on and what your father told you and maybe some elaboration on the tape that has been released.
[02:27:28.590 --> 02:27:29.851]  We really appreciate your time.
[02:27:30.331 --> 02:27:33.693]  Ladies and gentlemen, this incredible interview will continue.
[02:27:35.698 --> 02:27:38.699]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.719 --> 02:27:42.401]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.482 --> 02:27:49.044]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:27:49.524 --> 02:27:54.166]  Did you know there's a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[02:27:54.546 --> 02:28:00.828]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[02:28:00.848 --> 02:28:04.430]  38% higher than Bill Clinton's highest budget.
[02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:14.415]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:28:51.166 --> 02:28:58.432]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[02:28:58.452 --> 02:29:09.902]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:29:09.962 --> 02:29:10.422]  Central.
[02:29:10.782 --> 02:29:16.367]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[02:29:16.707 --> 02:29:22.589]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:29:23.089 --> 02:29:27.831]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[02:29:28.211 --> 02:29:33.013]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[02:29:33.453 --> 02:29:34.754]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[02:29:34.814 --> 02:29:35.234]  Central.
[02:29:35.814 --> 02:29:43.237]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:50.031]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:50.251 --> 02:29:53.652]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:53.812 --> 02:29:57.333]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:57.553 --> 02:30:00.874]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:30:00.974 --> 02:30:06.295]  This basic tenant of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[02:30:06.335 --> 02:30:11.557]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[02:30:11.937 --> 02:30:12.297]  Thank you!
[02:30:29.426 --> 02:30:32.869]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:30:32.909 --> 02:30:33.890]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:31:18.354 --> 02:31:28.522]  We really are making history here today, and I know he's going further than he has in some previous interviews, and I want to get into the central area of the assassination here in a moment, but St.
[02:31:28.562 --> 02:31:30.943]  John Hunt is our guest.
[02:31:30.963 --> 02:31:32.745]  We're going to have him back up again in the near future.
[02:31:32.765 --> 02:31:35.967]  We just can't do this in an hour with 44 minutes of air time.
[02:31:36.588 --> 02:31:36.748]  St.
[02:31:36.768 --> 02:31:41.191]  John, please continue where we left off with your mother flying to Chicago and what happened.
[02:31:41.684 --> 02:31:51.950]  Well, okay, she was on a flight to Chicago from Washington, D.C., and she was carrying a substantial amount of cash, between $10,000 and $100,000.
[02:31:51.990 --> 02:31:54.712]  It's never been accurately determined.
[02:31:56.253 --> 02:32:11.262]  Also, she was carrying with her information that would cause the Nixon White House to be pressured into continuing paying what they considered was the hush money.
[02:32:11.642 --> 02:32:22.630]  And that information was canceled checks from a Mexican bank in the account of Bernard Barker that came directly from the committee to re-elect the president, or what's been called CREEP.
[02:32:23.491 --> 02:32:31.496]  Anyways, this information was to serve to blow the Nixon White House out of the water if they didn't continue paying off the hush money.
[02:32:32.617 --> 02:32:39.482]  So the plane flies into Chicago, is rerouted and diverted to a different airport,
[02:32:40.098 --> 02:32:55.505]  And within moments of the crash, there was 50 FBI and DIA agents on the ground courting the crash off, telling the police and fire department to stand down until they were finished sorting through the wreckage.
[02:32:55.545 --> 02:32:59.747]  They were probably looking for that suitcase, or at least making sure it had been destroyed.
[02:33:01.047 --> 02:33:01.708]  The FBI
[02:33:03.281 --> 02:33:14.415]  Illegally came into the tower control room and confiscated all the tapes that had been recorded between that airplane and the tower.
[02:33:15.456 --> 02:33:22.744]  The very next day, December 9th, 1972, Nixon's top White House aide, Eagle Bud Crow Jr.,
[02:33:23.858 --> 02:33:36.017]  Um, was appointed Undersecretary of Transportation, which supervises the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration, the two agencies that investigate the plane crash.
[02:33:37.180 --> 02:33:44.884]  On December 19th, a White House Deputy Assistant to Nixon and Undersecretary to the Cabinet, Alexander Butterfield, was appointed as the new head of the FAA.
[02:33:45.965 --> 02:33:52.588]  Later on, Dwight L. Chapin was appointed top executive of United Airlines.
[02:33:52.628 --> 02:33:53.128]  So there was a huge
[02:33:54.469 --> 02:34:00.996]  Scrambling to get this plane crash, you know, sealed up and... Now I've seen the sums.
[02:34:01.096 --> 02:34:05.400]  I've seen the sums that are being paid to the dutiful servants of Nixon.
[02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:06.881]  They weren't that big.
[02:34:06.921 --> 02:34:11.245]  People needed this for attorneys and to live and the men were going to prison and keeping their mouths shut.
[02:34:11.686 --> 02:34:14.809]  Why didn't those bastards take care of their people?
[02:34:15.353 --> 02:34:23.841]  No, because, you know, those bastards were of a very thin makeup.
[02:34:23.861 --> 02:34:25.022]  They didn't want to follow through.
[02:34:25.283 --> 02:34:35.493]  My father told me that in the covert ops world, if you're taken prisoner, if you die in the service of your country, your family is well taken care of.
[02:34:35.533 --> 02:34:39.837]  That's just an unwritten rule that everybody understands, and he just assumed
[02:34:40.997 --> 02:34:46.719]  Naively, I guess, that these people would follow the same line of reasoning.
[02:34:47.159 --> 02:34:49.100]  But Nixon was really willing to pay.
[02:34:50.660 --> 02:34:54.961]  You can hear him on the transcript saying, you know, what is it going to take to keep Hunt quiet?
[02:34:54.981 --> 02:34:55.621]  A million dollars?
[02:34:55.661 --> 02:34:56.962]  We could come up with that, he says.
[02:34:57.342 --> 02:34:58.682]  You know, we can get that kind of money.
[02:34:58.702 --> 02:34:59.802]  We can get more, yeah.
[02:34:59.883 --> 02:35:00.643]  We can get more, yeah.
[02:35:00.843 --> 02:35:02.403]  I mean, he had a huge war chest.
[02:35:02.443 --> 02:35:04.424]  Yeah, he had Texas oil money.
[02:35:04.624 --> 02:35:06.884]  Oh, yeah.
[02:35:06.984 --> 02:35:08.485]  But, you know, he was advised by
[02:35:09.150 --> 02:35:12.111]  You know, by his staff, that we've got to cut loose of this.
[02:35:12.131 --> 02:35:13.591]  You know, we can't just keep paying these people.
[02:35:13.611 --> 02:35:17.592]  Which a lot of evidence now shows that Kissinger, the whole time, was really setting Nixon up.
[02:35:18.292 --> 02:35:19.312]  It seems that way, doesn't it?
[02:35:19.972 --> 02:35:23.473]  Yeah, let's just blow her out of the air and let's just not... I mean, unbelievable.
[02:35:23.773 --> 02:35:24.633]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:24.753 --> 02:35:26.934]  He would have never gone down if that had just taken care of everybody.
[02:35:26.954 --> 02:35:33.415]  Right, well, that's... yeah, I can't speculate on what would have happened, but we certainly know what did happen.
[02:35:34.307 --> 02:35:35.688]  Unbelievable treachery.
[02:35:36.348 --> 02:35:38.770]  Now, there's so many facets to this.
[02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:41.952]  Can you just recap, basically, what's on the tape?
[02:35:42.292 --> 02:35:43.513]  You have 15 minutes more.
[02:35:43.573 --> 02:35:45.214]  Maybe give us a hint of what's on that.
[02:35:46.255 --> 02:35:49.497]  And then, any other areas that are safe for you to talk about?
[02:35:49.557 --> 02:35:50.858]  Anything that hasn't been revealed?
[02:35:51.238 --> 02:35:55.799]  Well, there's a lot of information on those pages, and there's additional information on the rest of the tape, but what we have up on my website,
[02:36:16.641 --> 02:36:17.041]  Thank you.
[02:36:34.034 --> 02:36:37.597]  With the recorder controls, but he made that tape... You know what, though?
[02:36:37.617 --> 02:36:40.660]  I think it'll be ten times more powerful if you put it out unedited.
[02:36:40.900 --> 02:36:45.485]  I understand why you edited it, but I think people hearing the rattling and the rest of it's important.
[02:36:45.845 --> 02:36:50.669]  Yeah, he's got that death rattle in his voice, and he's, you know, fumbling with the record button.
[02:36:51.630 --> 02:37:00.158]  But, yeah, the tape is interesting in its entirety, and we're going to try to get that up as soon as we can.
[02:37:01.170 --> 02:37:06.776]  The memos that have never been seen before that he wrote me outline
[02:37:07.611 --> 02:37:34.020]  The chain of command, starting with LBJ, he drew a box around LBJ's name and then linked that to Cord Meyer, and then to the right he linked that to David Phillips, and then below Phillips was a line going to William Harvey, and then from Harvey there was a spidering out to Antonio Vecchiana, Frank Sturgis, David Morales, and Lucien Sarti.
[02:37:35.215 --> 02:37:50.309]  Uh, the second page of the handwritten memos is a, is a full document, you know, handwritten all the way from the top to the bottom, uh, outlining information about each of those individuals, uh, and he wrote, uh, over the period of a week, he wrote about four pages.
[02:37:50.909 --> 02:37:51.890]  I'm glad you're here.
[02:38:14.444 --> 02:38:20.628]  Absolutely, and then the media was balking at your memos, but on top of that you've got the tape, which is clearly E. Howard Hunt.
[02:38:21.029 --> 02:38:22.650]  Yes, oh absolutely, there's no doubt.
[02:38:23.330 --> 02:38:33.137]  Now, expanding on this, it's not just that there's the Dallas Morning News and Dallas Time Herald photos of all these tramps being picked up, being released from the police station, all of this.
[02:38:33.577 --> 02:38:38.721]  There's also the fact that you do have Frank Scourges right next to what's clearly your father.
[02:38:38.741 --> 02:38:40.022]  There's three different photos.
[02:38:40.722 --> 02:38:42.664]  Uh, and then another known CIA guy.
[02:38:42.724 --> 02:38:48.951]  I mean, when you've got them lined up together, and you do side-by-sides, I mean, the Scourges thing, this is a dead ringer.
[02:38:50.072 --> 02:38:51.413]  I mean, there's no debating.
[02:38:51.794 --> 02:38:54.616]  And then that's what the police and others said, and eyewitnesses said.
[02:38:55.297 --> 02:38:55.557]  Yeah.
[02:38:55.758 --> 02:38:56.658]  No, I agree.
[02:38:56.919 --> 02:39:04.046]  You know, as my father's son, I just, every time I look at that comparison photo between the tramps and my father, it's just, he just looks...
[02:39:05.476 --> 02:39:06.697]  It looks like my father to me.
[02:39:06.737 --> 02:39:10.020]  Now, I can't, of course, I can't say definitively if it is him or not.
[02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:13.162]  But then you add that with Sturgis, who's closer in the photos.
[02:39:13.202 --> 02:39:13.983]  I mean, it's Sturgis.
[02:39:14.343 --> 02:39:14.824]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:14.844 --> 02:39:17.746]  I mean, he's a pretty handsome, swashbuckling-looking guy.
[02:39:17.766 --> 02:39:19.428]  It's Frank Sturgis.
[02:39:19.768 --> 02:39:24.492]  He looks like somebody out of a movie, you know, of the 50s and what a CIA commando would look like.
[02:39:24.752 --> 02:39:25.433]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:39:25.473 --> 02:39:27.174]  Yeah, that certainly does look like Frank.
[02:39:27.755 --> 02:39:28.736]  I've met Frank before.
[02:39:29.808 --> 02:39:35.971]  And, you know, I can say that in my gut feeling that that certainly looks like Frank too.
[02:39:37.592 --> 02:39:49.298]  Of course, you know, in more modern, more recent times, people have come forward to say that they were the tramps, but I think we have at least two people for every tramp now that are claiming to be the tramps.
[02:39:49.318 --> 02:39:54.601]  You've got a lot of, I mean, any time there's a murder, you're going to have four or five people show up saying they did it, they're complete moonbags.
[02:39:55.901 --> 02:40:22.846]  But expanding on that line, now, what I've always gotten from all the experts and people I've interviewed living here in Texas and talking to people who've even been out at the shooting ranges and things and mistresses and all the rest of it, and his lawyer, and some things that haven't even been on air by the way, folks, that I'm not allowed to talk about, I don't even like to say, but the point is, this is all dangerous stuff, the point is, is that the info I got is your dad was not pulling triggers, he was there kind of in a command function,
[02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:25.021]  Yeah, I would agree with that.
[02:40:25.462 --> 02:40:34.391]  If he was directly involved like that, he was definitely not one of the shooters because that's just not the kind of job that they would have given to a man like my father.
[02:40:34.431 --> 02:40:41.998]  My father had one foot in the front lines and he had the other foot firmly in place in the
[02:40:43.159 --> 02:40:44.240]  In the suit-and-tie world.
[02:40:44.300 --> 02:40:51.862]  So he would have, you know, they would have brought in someone like a Corsican gunman, a Cuban gunman or something like that.
[02:40:51.942 --> 02:40:56.604]  And of course my father did always believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was firing from the rear.
[02:40:59.785 --> 02:41:02.626]  Now Oswald, we've now got his CIA control number.
[02:41:02.686 --> 02:41:04.167]  We know he was in black ops.
[02:41:04.467 --> 02:41:07.668]  Do you think they just hung him out to dry as the Patsy as they do so many times?
[02:41:08.408 --> 02:41:09.549]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:41:09.589 --> 02:41:10.269]  I think Oswald's
[02:41:10.865 --> 02:41:12.026]  Was a very tragic figure.
[02:41:12.086 --> 02:41:28.877]  I think he was being sheep-dipped by many intelligence, you know, by all kinds of people for, you know, for their own personal reasons and for their, you know, as someone, I mean, that can be used as a Patsy and I think that's exactly what happened.
[02:41:28.897 --> 02:41:38.364]  I don't think he was really aware of what was happening and if he did fire, you know, that's... They also did that with McVeigh.
[02:41:39.182 --> 02:41:55.799]  Now of course it's come out in a sealed affidavits that I've seen because I saw before it was sealed and with other eyewitnesses and we have the names it fits with everything else we knew that they took him out of special ops he did not wash out folks and then they had him and they set him up big time too.
[02:41:55.819 --> 02:42:02.366]  Yeah well I think that's that's that's probably correct yeah yeah I don't know much about that story though.
[02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:06.965]  Well, I mean, it's the classic thing of the general sacrificing the tribes to lure in the enemy.
[02:42:07.025 --> 02:42:09.468]  I mean, this is 101 military operations.
[02:42:09.909 --> 02:42:10.870]  Yeah, it is.
[02:42:11.010 --> 02:42:14.454]  And as far as my dad's history with the agency goes, I think
[02:42:15.637 --> 02:42:24.544]  You know, he was sadly hung out to dry by the agency and by the government that he so dutifully served and loved so dearly.
[02:42:24.664 --> 02:42:28.867]  Now, did he tell you why he went along with the killing of JFK?
[02:42:28.887 --> 02:42:30.729]  I mean, did you ever ask Dad why?
[02:42:30.809 --> 02:42:34.031]  I mean, did he say, oh, because we thought he was a communist, or what did he say?
[02:42:34.511 --> 02:42:40.336]  Well, he told me that within the intelligence circles,
[02:42:42.557 --> 02:42:59.744]  It was felt that it was an imperative situation that President Kennedy not be allowed to serve in that office for any longer because there was a lot of crucial things coming down.
[02:42:59.784 --> 02:43:00.844]  There was the Vietnam War.
[02:43:01.961 --> 02:43:27.270]  uh... was probably one of the main reasons uh... you know there was also the anger and the threats that kennedy had made to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces uh... my father was prior to to kennedy's administration was really looking to become uh... eventually the uh... the directorate of the central intelligence agency had been a twenty seven year career person uh... he had to have been in the original OSS uh... which was the predecessor to the CIA
[02:43:28.311 --> 02:43:40.191]  And because of Kennedy's lack of testicular fortitude, he withheld the air cover at the Bay of Pigs and that whole thing just brought...
[02:43:41.779 --> 02:43:51.270]  Sure, we have the control documents declassified with George H. W. Bush being in the CIA.
[02:43:51.610 --> 02:43:57.417]  We know he went into the CIA before he became the director in the mid-70s, claiming that was his first time ever being there.
[02:43:58.158 --> 02:44:01.842]  We know that there are very clear, two different photographs that are clearly
[02:44:02.362 --> 02:44:10.426]  I mean, if they're not, it's his twin brother, George Herbert Walker Bush, in Dallas, outside the Books Depository building.
[02:44:11.127 --> 02:44:13.048]  You know, we have all that right there.
[02:44:14.689 --> 02:44:17.330]  Did your father ever say anything about George H.W.
[02:44:17.370 --> 02:44:17.710]  Bush?
[02:44:18.231 --> 02:44:20.312]  No, he never discussed George H.W.
[02:44:20.352 --> 02:44:20.772]  Bush to me.
[02:44:21.292 --> 02:44:28.136]  I mean, you know about his support in the Bay of Pigs, with the oil company and the drilling rigs, and it named after his wife?
[02:44:28.983 --> 02:44:31.684]  No, I'm not aware of those things.
[02:44:32.184 --> 02:44:32.865]  I don't know about that.
[02:44:33.965 --> 02:44:34.645]  It's interesting, though.
[02:44:34.665 --> 02:44:35.446]  I'd like to look into it.
[02:44:36.586 --> 02:44:52.553]  Well, in the article we wrote that's up on InfoWars.com today, in the guest section, it was written on Monday, you can go in there and look at all... I'm sure you've seen the famous photos of what looks like your father with some of the other operatives, but then, yeah, we've got the photos there of George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:44:53.300 --> 02:44:54.341]  No, I'm not aware of that.
[02:44:54.361 --> 02:44:54.981]  That's interesting.
[02:44:55.101 --> 02:44:56.843]  Who are these individuals?
[02:45:11.425 --> 02:45:18.988]  Well, that has come out with Madeline Duncan Brown and with Jim Mars and many others, but Madeline Duncan Brown, of course, was his mistress.
[02:45:19.308 --> 02:45:19.568]  Yeah.
[02:45:20.069 --> 02:45:21.609]  Yeah, I heard that she has a book out.
[02:45:21.629 --> 02:45:25.351]  I haven't read it yet, but she supports the Lyndon Baines Johnson theory of
[02:45:26.232 --> 02:45:46.486]  of uh... who's responsible and so does his lawyer uh... bar mcclellan yes she she died a few years ago but i interviewed her on the radio several times then we also uh... uh... former NSA uh... operative uh... Robert Galen Ross interviewed her a few years ago on video we have that up on PrisonPlanet.tv I'll send you a free membership so you can watch it no thank you thank you so much sir
[02:45:47.006 --> 02:45:48.147]  Yeah, I'll definitely look into it.
[02:45:49.008 --> 02:45:53.591]  Any other facets, any other areas, tidbits, pieces of information you think we should know?
[02:45:53.611 --> 02:46:00.677]  Again, we're talking about the son, the firstborn son of E. Howard Hunt, the legendary black op commander for the CIA.
[02:46:02.559 --> 02:46:12.707]  Boy, it's such a huge story, but I think, you know, overall, my father left a lot of
[02:46:16.124 --> 02:46:17.745]  Unanswered questions with me.
[02:46:30.208 --> 02:46:35.671]  He had to submit to the wishes of those people that were immediately around him.
[02:46:36.212 --> 02:46:38.353]  He was, you know, very worried and concerned.
[02:46:38.673 --> 02:46:47.879]  He knew that his disclosures in Watergate and his infamy had led to the splintering of his first family, the death of his wife.
[02:46:49.500 --> 02:46:58.946]  And so he was also very concerned that any new revelations that would come out, since he was still going to be alive for a few more years,
[02:46:59.743 --> 02:47:04.586]  Would have had a dramatic negative effect on his second family, which he did not want to put them through.
[02:47:04.927 --> 02:47:08.409]  Did he get angry when your mother was killed, when your mother died?
[02:47:08.809 --> 02:47:09.409]  Was he angry?
[02:47:09.429 --> 02:47:13.172]  I mean, did he instantly know who was behind it?
[02:47:14.092 --> 02:47:16.974]  Well, you know, he was in prison at the time.
[02:47:17.394 --> 02:47:21.437]  And so, you know, he was let out to go and identify the body.
[02:47:21.457 --> 02:47:25.219]  Or he was in jail, actually, before he was sentenced.
[02:47:26.873 --> 02:47:29.175]  He had never discussed it with me.
[02:47:30.876 --> 02:47:35.878]  The only time he said anything to me about it was that he thought it was just pilot error.
[02:47:36.759 --> 02:47:41.402]  Of course, later on in his life, at one of these bedside confessions, I was talking to him
[02:47:47.389 --> 02:47:54.090]  You know, bring my sisters into the fold again and have them forgive my father because they held a lot of things against him.
[02:47:54.130 --> 02:47:55.991]  They blamed him for the death of our mother.
[02:47:56.011 --> 02:48:01.391]  And I said, you know, I've been talking to my sisters and trying to get them to come down and see you.
[02:48:01.852 --> 02:48:08.113]  And the tears started welling up in his eyes and he said, you know, Saint, I was so worried.
[02:48:08.273 --> 02:48:15.514]  I was so deeply concerned that what happened to your mother, that what they did to your mother, they could have done to you children.
[02:48:16.460 --> 02:48:19.001]  And that caused the hair on my neck to stand up.
[02:48:19.621 --> 02:48:27.264]  That was the first disclosure from my father that he thought there was something else going on besides just the sheer pilot error.
[02:48:28.945 --> 02:48:29.665]  Unbelievable.
[02:48:29.765 --> 02:48:32.486]  Serve the Dark Lords and they strike down your wife.
[02:48:32.926 --> 02:48:35.688]  We'll be back with a final segment with St.
[02:48:35.728 --> 02:48:36.488]  John Hunt.
[02:48:37.468 --> 02:48:38.409]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:48:38.469 --> 02:48:41.890]  This is the GCN Radio Network as we make history.
[02:48:48.826 --> 02:48:54.293]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.654 --> 02:49:02.224]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.992 --> 02:49:10.034]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.434 --> 02:49:21.877]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.177 --> 02:49:25.638]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.138 --> 02:49:28.079]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.399 --> 02:49:32.180]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:02.313 --> 02:50:04.435]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:50:04.935 --> 02:50:05.816]  Sheltering in Place.
[02:50:06.216 --> 02:50:09.940]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.

[02:52:08.015 --> 02:52:08.235]  St.
[02:52:08.275 --> 02:52:10.736]  John Hunt, stjohnhunt.com is the website.
[02:52:10.796 --> 02:52:14.698]  I'm going to have him back up next week for a full hour to take your calls.
[02:52:15.058 --> 02:52:17.399]  You cannot do this in one hour interview.
[02:52:17.419 --> 02:52:18.839]  Maybe we'll even have him up for an hour and a half.
[02:52:20.100 --> 02:52:22.600]  But again, I appreciate your courage, sir.
[02:52:22.680 --> 02:52:30.803]  Everything you've said meshes with the information I've gotten over a decade plus of research and interviewing others who've researched it for 30, 40 years.
[02:52:34.694 --> 02:52:48.849]  I think your father reprieves himself by going public at the end and people who always want some type of deathbed confession or for one of the actual people involved to go public, here it is.
[02:52:50.150 --> 02:52:55.915]  With everything else, this has got to really discredit the mainstream media and the official line in the Warren Commission.
[02:52:55.935 --> 02:52:56.716]  Can you comment on that?
[02:52:57.317 --> 02:53:02.962]  Well, I think it really does, and I just think my father was very brave for
[02:53:04.395 --> 02:53:14.479]  You know, for coming out with this, I think he felt an obligation, even though it went against his grain to implicate his own government.
[02:53:14.599 --> 02:53:21.922]  I think he felt the greater need to disclose the truth, and I'm happy that he disclosed that truth to me.
[02:53:21.942 --> 02:53:26.244]  Well, that was the question I was going to ask you.
[02:53:26.284 --> 02:53:28.085]  Why do you think they never tried to take him out?
[02:53:28.125 --> 02:53:29.465]  They thought they had him under their control?
[02:53:30.106 --> 02:53:33.047]  Well, I think they did, and he sat quietly.
[02:53:33.755 --> 02:53:40.298]  You know he did his time in prison and then the rest of his life he became just kind of a regular guy.
[02:53:40.678 --> 02:53:47.902]  He wrote his novels one or two a year and lived quietly, raised a new family and basically just
[02:53:48.860 --> 02:53:50.401]  You know, stay out of the limelight.
[02:53:50.421 --> 02:53:58.186]  The last thing he wanted was to, you know, create a huge storm of controversy around his new life.
[02:53:58.246 --> 02:54:07.992]  I think he'd been shown quite severely what the government is willing to do to control aspects.
[02:54:08.292 --> 02:54:14.956]  And so, you know, his wife had been killed and his family had been splintered to the far ends of the country.
[02:54:16.179 --> 02:54:44.186]  uh... and he just uh... he he knew you know he's this is this is a hardball game situation and i think he just was uh... you know very intimidated by that but i think the fact that he did finally go public with the inch does show a lot of courage it does show a lot of courage and i think i mean i think a novel just about how they i hate to say this to his son but how they took your father i think genuinely was a pro-american person and to watch how they twisted him yeah well he was he was definitely handled and manipulated by people of uh...
[02:54:45.466 --> 02:54:48.748]  of self-serving interests, Nixon and his cronies.
[02:54:48.768 --> 02:54:58.994]  You know, this was a man that they knew was operating on a patriotic stand and they just took that and they just, you know, manipulated my father.
[02:54:59.094 --> 02:55:05.438]  And in your research, there's no doubt that, I mean, I know there's no doubt here, that clearly Nixon and LBJ, it's two birds of a feather.
[02:55:05.658 --> 02:55:07.800]  They're just two operatives for even bigger powers.
[02:55:08.505 --> 02:55:14.570]  Yes, I would assume so, because the President is kind of like an empty office.
[02:55:14.830 --> 02:55:20.995]  You also told me during the break, and we're about to enter, that's why I'm hurrying, that 60 Minutes was going to do this, but passed.
[02:55:21.515 --> 02:55:24.678]  It took four weeks longer for the LA Times to do a whitewash on this.
[02:55:24.918 --> 02:55:26.119]  I mean, they're still scared, aren't they?
[02:55:26.499 --> 02:55:27.460]  Yeah, I think they are.
[02:55:27.660 --> 02:55:28.221]  I think they are.
[02:55:28.281 --> 02:55:34.626]  So I'm really thankful for your show, sir, to allow me to bring this information out, and thank God for the Internet as well.
[02:55:35.346 --> 02:55:37.789]  Well, I'm thankful for you, and we talked during the break.
[02:55:37.829 --> 02:55:39.971]  You said that you have said more here than you've said anywhere else.
[02:55:40.011 --> 02:55:45.817]  I'm honored that that happened, and I'm also honored to find out that you were aware of my work, and I look forward to talking to you next week.
[02:55:45.857 --> 02:55:50.142]  And as soon as that book comes out, we want to carry it, and we want to support the work you're doing.
[02:55:50.182 --> 02:55:52.364]  And again, we appreciate your courage.
[02:55:52.684 --> 02:55:55.127]  stjohnhunt.com is the website.
[02:55:55.167 --> 02:55:55.347]  St.
[02:55:55.387 --> 02:55:56.328]  John, God bless you.
[02:55:56.568 --> 02:55:57.469]  We'll be praying for you.
[02:55:57.749 --> 02:55:58.250]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:55:58.988 --> 02:56:08.735]  Folks, don't forget we have the online video and bookstore at InfoWars.com if you want to support the work we're doing here as we try to stop this country from turning into a fascist dictatorship.
[02:56:08.755 --> 02:56:14.819]  Because if you think LBJ and Nixon were bad, the people running things now make them look like choir boys.
[02:56:15.259 --> 02:56:21.443]  So InfoWars.com, be sure to visit the site or get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for all that JFK coverage.
[02:56:21.743 --> 02:56:22.604]  God bless you all!
