[00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.793]  And thanks to Inventech, no one's gonna cash in but me.
[00:00:04.793 --> 00:00:08.897]  They're going to help me get my invention off the drawing board and into the marketplace.
[00:00:08.897 --> 00:00:10.578]  I really need Inventech.
[00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:11.639]  What's that number again?
[00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.160]  1-800-313-6868.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.800]  One more time?
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:12.981]  Call 1-800-313-6868.
[00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:13.281]  That's 1-800-313-6868.
[00:00:29.498 --> 00:00:39.803]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:39.803 --> 00:00:41.104]  Big Brother.
[00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:42.885]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:42.885 --> 00:00:44.646]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:46.227]  You want answers?
[00:00:46.227 --> 00:00:47.767]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:51.970]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.072]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:16.003]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:18.125]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:20.366]  I tell you, I feel like myself again.
[00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:24.839]  For the last, I don't know, what is it?
[00:01:24.839 --> 00:01:28.642]  Almost two weeks, I have had the worst allergies of my lifetime.
[00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:32.125]  And I know I've been starting a lot of the programs discussing that.
[00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:36.428]  I don't normally talk about, you know, how I feel or what my health is like.
[00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:47.136]  It's just so amazing to live in a city where everyone I know has horrible sinus headaches and something that mimics a chest cold.
[00:01:47.136 --> 00:01:50.579]  And you talk to everybody and it wasn't like this in the past.
[00:01:51.357 --> 00:01:53.498]  You've got to ask yourself, what has changed?
[00:01:53.498 --> 00:01:55.999]  Why are allergies all over the country?
[00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:04.061]  But especially in Austin, Texas, known as the national capital, the worst place in America, in the U.S., for allergies.
[00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:07.683]  Why has it gotten so bad?
[00:02:07.683 --> 00:02:17.586]  So in the last week and a half or so, if I've sounded like a toad or been a bit grumpy, it's because of a strange effect that the allergies have
[00:02:19.398 --> 00:02:22.599]  I guess when you feel bad and you make yourself go to work, you're a bit curmudgeonly.
[00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.300]  But I am honored to be your host and honored to be here.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.463]  And I am blessed that I'm going on a short vacation for part of next week to visit family.
[00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:44.567]  Maybe I can fully escape the allergies then, but I'm going to have Jack Blood and Bob Dacey for the days I'm out sitting in next week, so you definitely do not want to miss that.
[00:02:44.567 --> 00:02:46.128]  It is Thursday.
[00:02:47.296 --> 00:02:52.998]  And it is the 11th day of January 2007.
[00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:55.399]  Still getting used to that.
[00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:57.920]  And obviously I want to have open phones today.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.902]  I want to give you a chance to respond to Bush's lengthy speech that he gave last night.
[00:03:03.902 --> 00:03:05.803]  I watched a lot of it.
[00:03:05.803 --> 00:03:08.884]  I was also working on a film while we had it on in the background.
[00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:19.505]  And we already basically heard all of this propaganda spewed by his different surrogates and his different handlers and his different front people, but I've had a chance to read the transcript.
[00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:28.591]  I've got several audio clips of it I want to play, but I want to give you a chance on air, all of you, to respond to what George Bush has said.
[00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:36.796]  We've got one of the head spokespeople from World Can't Wait, a lady who basically destroyed Bill O'Reilly a few days ago.
[00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:43.953]  We've got one of the ladies who led the shutdown of the Democrats, a little press conference.
[00:03:43.953 --> 00:03:47.275]  She's going to be joining us for about 30 minutes in the next hour.
[00:03:47.275 --> 00:03:52.837]  Other than that, we're going to have wide open phones today.
[00:03:52.837 --> 00:03:58.259]  And we can talk about any issue, any news story, anything you wish to discuss.
[00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:59.800]  You are welcome to call in at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:05.655 --> 00:04:06.156]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:06.156 --> 00:04:12.162]  But as I said, I will go over Bush's speech.
[00:04:12.162 --> 00:04:16.827]  Also, some news that's really sensational.
[00:04:16.827 --> 00:04:20.190]  It's so important and no one seems to be pointing it out.
[00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.834]  Well, it's in a few British papers, but it's a footnote.
[00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:27.038]  And that is that
[00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:38.017]  Our government, our illegitimate criminal government, is openly funding, in a takeover of Somalia, the very warlords that killed our troops in 1993.
[00:04:38.017 --> 00:04:47.404]  The real agenda of the global elite in Somalia, neocons are backing the same warlords that slaughtered U.S.
[00:04:47.404 --> 00:04:48.045]  troops in 1993.
[00:04:48.045 --> 00:04:57.192]  That's a story by Steve Watson up on InfoWars.net, another one by Paul Watson, that added the information that we got yesterday with our
[00:04:58.119 --> 00:05:00.622]  Our expert on Somalia we had on.
[00:05:00.622 --> 00:05:04.927]  Bush administration empowers Somali warlords who killed U.S.
[00:05:04.927 --> 00:05:06.649]  troops.
[00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:15.058]  Bombing clears path for re-emergence of Black Hawk Down savages to cost of Somali people.
[00:05:19.477 --> 00:05:20.839]  We'll break this down.
[00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:22.981]  Bush's speech, what it really means.
[00:05:22.981 --> 00:05:25.223]  We kind of had an epiphany this morning.
[00:05:25.223 --> 00:05:26.325]  And a lot more today.
[00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:27.766]  You don't want to miss this broadcast.
[00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:44.382]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:44.382 --> 00:05:52.045]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:52.737 --> 00:06:00.181]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:11.907]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police fortune, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:11.907 --> 00:06:15.890]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.151]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:18.151 --> 00:06:21.993]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:36.841 --> 00:06:38.202]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:38.202 --> 00:06:41.263]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:41.263 --> 00:06:43.785]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared.
[00:06:43.785 --> 00:06:45.826]  It can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:45.826 --> 00:06:46.986]  So what do you do?
[00:06:46.986 --> 00:06:51.529]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:54.631]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:54.631 --> 00:07:09.382]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:35.942]  Attention!
[00:07:35.942 --> 00:07:37.383]  Attention everyone!
[00:07:37.383 --> 00:07:40.025]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:44.709]  It's called Wristease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[00:07:45.373 --> 00:07:52.715]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[00:07:52.715 --> 00:08:06.038]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[00:08:06.038 --> 00:08:10.499]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:14.360]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:20.944]  And, Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[00:08:20.944 --> 00:08:24.346]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[00:08:24.346 --> 00:08:31.110]  That's Wristease, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, Wristease.com.
[00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.693]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[00:08:35.693 --> 00:08:41.236]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:50.928 --> 00:09:00.817]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:00.817 --> 00:09:06.923]  Now to the second segment of this live Thursday edition, the 11th, now, of January 2007.
[00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:13.586]  So Bush gave his big speech, and I'm going to walk through some of that.
[00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:15.506]  We're going to play some clips of it later.
[00:09:15.506 --> 00:09:18.287]  We're going to have open phones.
[00:09:18.287 --> 00:09:21.928]  We've also got a BBC report about uranium killing troops.
[00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:24.608]  That's the headline.
[00:09:24.608 --> 00:09:29.450]  Just unbelievable how much of this stuff that they've used.
[00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.170]  But there is a report here
[00:09:32.771 --> 00:09:42.178]  Where the New York Times has got the headline, Democrats plan to fight expansion of troops.
[00:09:42.178 --> 00:09:45.120]  Democrats plan to fight expansion of troops.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.902]  Now notice that.
[00:09:47.902 --> 00:09:51.985]  They're going to fight the expansion.
[00:09:51.985 --> 00:09:56.828]  It doesn't matter whether there's 144,000 or 165,000 that they're talking about beefing it up to.
[00:10:02.067 --> 00:10:03.868]  22,000 plus.
[00:10:03.868 --> 00:10:05.169]  It doesn't matter.
[00:10:05.169 --> 00:10:06.849]  The troops are there.
[00:10:06.849 --> 00:10:08.590]  The war is ongoing.
[00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:19.155]  So everybody was asking, why when the American people, 78% in major polls, and the polls are out again today, showing similar numbers, why are they saying they're going to increase them?
[00:10:19.155 --> 00:10:20.656]  And why is McCain saying that?
[00:10:20.656 --> 00:10:27.759]  And why is the Iraq Study Group saying that's one of their five recommendations?
[00:10:27.759 --> 00:10:29.260]  And then Bush is criticizing it.
[00:10:31.084 --> 00:10:35.546]  And then Bush suddenly flip-flops and says, OK, I'm for it, I agree, I screwed up.
[00:10:35.546 --> 00:10:51.574]  Well, number one, it puts it all into a political process now that de-partisanizes, if you could invent the word, takes the partisanship out of it, at least for a lot of Americans who are just partisans.
[00:10:51.574 --> 00:10:55.256]  They don't care if we're attacking countries as long as it's the Democrats and Bill Clinton doing it.
[00:10:57.151 --> 00:10:59.072]  And so it's power sharing.
[00:10:59.072 --> 00:11:02.074]  Hey, we're sharing the power with the New Democrats.
[00:11:02.074 --> 00:11:20.804]  But really what this is all about is that by escalating the troops, it gives the Democrats something in a dog and pony show, in a good cop, bad cop stage, thespian, theatrical event, it gives them some type of fight they can engage in.
[00:11:20.804 --> 00:11:23.065]  Because if Bush would have just left the troops at the same level,
[00:11:24.381 --> 00:11:28.605]  This gets into the whole Machiavellian, you know, Byzantine workings of this.
[00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:36.892]  If they would have just left the troops at the same level, the Democrats would have, you know, had to demand that the war end and the troops be brought home.
[00:11:36.892 --> 00:11:38.113]  That's what the people are wanting.
[00:11:38.113 --> 00:11:46.881]  But by Bush surging, and that is not a surge, that's a drop in the bucket for what they would, quote, really need to pacify.
[00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:51.244]  Basically, once resistance gets a hold, you just, five million U.S.
[00:11:51.244 --> 00:11:51.925]  troops couldn't do it.
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.521]  In fact, that would make more targets.
[00:11:56.521 --> 00:12:00.762]  Actually, an escalation helps the insurgency.
[00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:07.845]  But again, that gets all off into military theories and schools.
[00:12:07.845 --> 00:12:10.085]  But that's what the real experts across the border are saying.
[00:12:10.085 --> 00:12:11.286]  This is worse.
[00:12:11.286 --> 00:12:15.947]  Even Oliver North is saying more targets is not the right idea.
[00:12:15.947 --> 00:12:17.388]  So, they're going to put
[00:12:18.923 --> 00:12:30.968]  More troops in, and the Democrats can then fight about that, and then Bush can pull them out in six months and make Eaton claim he stabilized something and just cut back on the amount of suicide bombings our government's staging over there.
[00:12:30.968 --> 00:12:35.870]  And it'll just drift off forever into this process.
[00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.611]  Look, they've said they're going to be there 30 years from now.
[00:12:38.611 --> 00:12:44.073]  They're building six giant permanent bases and 30-plus smaller bases.
[00:12:44.073 --> 00:12:48.335]  And I mean, these green zone bases they're building have 50-foot walls
[00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:54.667]  They're ringed with artillery, and they're luxury compounds on the inside.
[00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:59.029]  I mean, that one embassy is for 4,000 people.
[00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:02.130]  Embassy staff, not just troops.
[00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.331]  And they got their bars, their whiskey bars, their whores.
[00:13:05.331 --> 00:13:06.652]  They got everything behind there.
[00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:11.133]  Their bowling alleys, their swimming pools, their gyms, their discotheques.
[00:13:11.133 --> 00:13:12.334]  It's a sick joke.
[00:13:13.903 --> 00:13:28.667]  Meanwhile, the stated goal to dismantle Iraq, to de-industrialize them, to knock them back in the Stone Age, to exterminate their population, to engage in genocide, three million of them dead, is ongoing.
[00:13:28.667 --> 00:13:32.968]  Is ongoing.
[00:13:32.968 --> 00:13:37.189]  And so, that's why Bush is doing this surge.
[00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:42.170]  The surge, more than anything, is so the Democrats have something to fight against.
[00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.450]  You see,
[00:13:43.462 --> 00:13:45.024]  We want to push him a step back.
[00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:47.106]  Bush, he takes two steps forward.
[00:13:47.106 --> 00:13:53.392]  No one will push him back a step, and he'll be right back where he wanted to be in the beginning.
[00:13:53.392 --> 00:13:58.076]  When I say Bush, I mean the people he fronts for.
[00:13:58.076 --> 00:14:03.661]  So you read all these headlines about Democrats getting tough, Democrats to, you know, they're going to decide the course of the war.
[00:14:03.661 --> 00:14:04.702]  They're going to teach Bush.
[00:14:04.702 --> 00:14:06.244]  They're in control now.
[00:14:06.244 --> 00:14:07.685]  And what is it?
[00:14:07.685 --> 00:14:08.626]  De-escalate.
[00:14:10.462 --> 00:14:20.266]  By standing up and resisting the 22,000 extra troops, and really it's not a de-escalate, it's leaving it right where it was.
[00:14:20.266 --> 00:14:33.312]  The new Democratic leaders of Congress on Wednesday accused President Bush of ignoring strong American sentiment against the war in Iraq, and said they would build a bipartisan campaign against his proposed military expansion.
[00:14:33.312 --> 00:14:36.313]  See, they're against the military expansion!
[00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:38.230]  But they're not really.
[00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.751]  Hillary, Schumer, Lieberman, all of them.
[00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:42.172]  Oh, we need to go ahead and hit Iran.
[00:14:42.172 --> 00:14:43.953]  We need to go ahead and go into Syria.
[00:14:43.953 --> 00:14:49.276]  Democrats continue to debate how assertively to confront Mr. Bush over his plan.
[00:14:49.276 --> 00:15:01.123]  House Democrats said they would seek to attach conditions to the spending request Mr. Bush will send to Congress soon, and that those conditions, if not met, could lead Congress to limit or halt money for wider military operations.
[00:15:01.123 --> 00:15:05.366]  So that's just, again, a whole process that just confuses the public, means nothing.
[00:15:05.979 --> 00:15:15.383]  We're going to fund the troops that are there, said Brenda Daly, an aide representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Speaker.
[00:15:15.383 --> 00:15:18.044]  Any escalation of troops will be subject to scrutiny.
[00:15:18.044 --> 00:15:20.005]  Oh, they're getting so tough!
[00:15:20.005 --> 00:15:25.248]  We will have hearings and we will set benchmarks that the President must meet to obtain his money.
[00:15:25.248 --> 00:15:32.991]  So they'll have big theatrical displays, you know, kind of like the whole Clarence Thomas and Ida Hill thing, and Democrats pointing fingers and acting tough.
[00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:39.964]  And the general Democratic population will be sucked in and brainwashed by it, and the war will just roll on forever.
[00:15:39.964 --> 00:15:49.127]  Then there'll be some new terror attack right when Hillary or Mitt Romney or... It's a joke with his name.
[00:15:49.127 --> 00:15:54.890]  You know, Take Power or Edwards or whoever, whatever Bilderberg group member it is.
[00:15:54.890 --> 00:16:02.313]  And then, oh see, the war was... I mean, the Democrats are saying, implement President Bush's
[00:16:06.135 --> 00:16:08.956]  9-11 Commission Report.
[00:16:08.956 --> 00:16:10.577]  All the recommendations.
[00:16:10.577 --> 00:16:12.978]  Total police state on steroids.
[00:16:12.978 --> 00:16:15.099]  And then they act like, we're getting Bush back!
[00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:16.760]  He didn't implement all of this!
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.841]  We'll show him!
[00:16:18.841 --> 00:16:20.822]  Total federalization of police.
[00:16:20.822 --> 00:16:22.783]  Total checkpoints.
[00:16:22.783 --> 00:16:25.584]  Total domestic CIA.
[00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:29.526]  And it's the Democrats bringing forward draft legislation?
[00:16:29.526 --> 00:16:31.487]  It's all a big dog and pony show.
[00:16:34.342 --> 00:16:35.343]  Very, very serious.
[00:16:35.343 --> 00:16:38.947]  The good news is, a lot of Democrats, a lot of Conservatives, a lot of Americans aren't buying it.
[00:16:38.947 --> 00:16:47.695]  Meanwhile, I tuned in to talk radio this morning, at the House, and then driving over to the office, and I heard the same thing on two different shows.
[00:16:47.695 --> 00:16:48.816]  Exact same script.
[00:16:49.418 --> 00:16:51.939]  I'll tell you what, we've got to stay over there.
[00:16:51.939 --> 00:16:58.103]  If we don't stay over there, Al-Qaeda will get all of our military equipment, we leave, and use it to attack us!
[00:16:58.103 --> 00:17:01.545]  And they'll get all those nuclear scientists in Iraq again!
[00:17:01.545 --> 00:17:03.426]  And they'll nuke us!
[00:17:03.426 --> 00:17:05.727]  And we've got to stay over there!
[00:17:05.727 --> 00:17:11.130]  Or, if we pull out once Al-Qaeda takes over Iraq, then we won't be able to re-invade.
[00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.310]  That's word for word.
[00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:17.093]  Two different hosts, exact same, they've got to have talking point scripts they're being given.
[00:17:18.323 --> 00:17:19.805]  I mean, I was freaking out.
[00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:20.847]  I heard one thing at my house.
[00:17:20.847 --> 00:17:25.934]  I get in the car, turn to another guy, another national talk show host.
[00:17:25.934 --> 00:17:29.219]  He's the guy that sells the national sales tax as a fair tax.
[00:17:29.219 --> 00:17:32.743]  Really, they're going to keep both and bill you through your national ID card.
[00:17:32.743 --> 00:17:33.304]  Just watch.
[00:17:36.705 --> 00:17:40.528]  I mean, I'm listening to this and it has no connection to reality.
[00:17:40.528 --> 00:17:42.410]  That place is stone age.
[00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.232]  They barely have running water.
[00:17:44.232 --> 00:17:47.855]  They have power in a few cities a few hours a day.
[00:17:47.855 --> 00:17:49.576]  They're literally starving to death.
[00:17:49.576 --> 00:17:50.717]  Hundreds of thousands a year.
[00:17:50.717 --> 00:17:52.919]  It is hell on earth.
[00:17:52.919 --> 00:17:55.321]  The most dangerous country in the world now.
[00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:56.122]  All by design.
[00:17:56.122 --> 00:17:59.124]  That was the plan before they went in.
[00:17:59.124 --> 00:18:04.088]  And the strategy of tension, balkanization.
[00:18:04.088 --> 00:18:04.729]  Breaking them up.
[00:18:05.535 --> 00:18:07.717]  Bringing them down.
[00:18:07.717 --> 00:18:16.162]  And, oh no, we've got to stay now, because see, Al-Qaeda, everybody fighting our troops is Al-Qaeda, didn't you know?
[00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:21.666]  Oh yeah, everybody over there who lost their mother, or their sister, or their brother, or their children.
[00:18:21.666 --> 00:18:24.288]  Everybody over there who lost their family members.
[00:18:24.288 --> 00:18:28.871]  Anybody who, I mean, there's like five different factions, three big ones.
[00:18:28.871 --> 00:18:29.311]  Anybody.
[00:18:30.313 --> 00:18:49.243]  Who takes a pot shot at the troops, anybody who fights back, anybody who doesn't like their country being invaded and being in literal hell on earth, and people being carpet bombed and just the whole city's being leveled, ongoing, anybody who does that's Al Qaeda.
[00:18:49.243 --> 00:18:49.883]  Just amazing.
[00:18:52.214 --> 00:19:07.338]  And these guys call into these talk shows, and you hear the listeners, the callers, they go, we've got to fight them and Lazo fascisms, and they're over there with them, and Al-Qaeda, and we've got to kill them all.
[00:19:07.338 --> 00:19:11.259]  They don't even know who the groups are, what's going on, the area's history.
[00:19:11.259 --> 00:19:17.361]  They can just barely say, Islamo-fascist.
[00:19:17.361 --> 00:19:20.582]  And you can read to them on air, here's the 83 Israeli plan.
[00:19:21.187 --> 00:19:22.948]  Here's the 2002 U.S.
[00:19:22.948 --> 00:19:39.957]  plan to break it up in three parts and to stimulate sectarian violence and to destroy the region and then to spread revolution system-wide to break down and weaken that entire area.
[00:19:39.957 --> 00:19:41.498]  I mean, I hear the very same people
[00:19:42.722 --> 00:19:47.466]  Call in going, man, we sure taught them Somalis that I did.
[00:19:47.466 --> 00:19:50.128]  We sure, I mean, you've heard them.
[00:19:50.128 --> 00:19:51.429]  We just hit them hard.
[00:19:51.429 --> 00:19:53.531]  I tell you, I love Bush.
[00:19:53.531 --> 00:20:04.980]  After what they did to our men in 93 under that traitor Clinton, I tell you what, I'm feeling real good right now.
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.442]  I mean, how foolish.
[00:20:07.442 --> 00:20:11.005]  Our criminal government funds the very warlords
[00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:16.344]  That shot down those helicopters and that drug our trips to the streets.
[00:20:16.344 --> 00:20:25.231]  The very people to go back in and make sure that country doesn't get on its hind legs, doesn't have a government.
[00:20:25.231 --> 00:20:31.055]  And by the time they're done with it, we blew away them people who hurt our trips.
[00:20:31.055 --> 00:20:32.757]  No, our government hired them.

[00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:39.171]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:39.171 --> 00:21:49.256]  Did you know that those seeking to destroy America and merge us into an all-powerful one-world government said that they support every movement to centralize all authority in Washington, D.C.
[00:21:49.256 --> 00:21:51.437]  and therefore bypass the state governments?
[00:21:52.345 --> 00:21:56.867]  That way they would have only one battle to win, Washington, D.C.
[00:21:56.867 --> 00:22:03.049]  Have we witnessed the accumulation of power in Washington and bypassing the states over the last 50 years?
[00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:11.232]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:45.829 --> 00:22:52.937]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?

[00:23:34.344 --> 00:23:35.806]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:35.806 --> 00:23:41.854]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:23:41.854 --> 00:23:42.675]  That's right.
[00:23:42.675 --> 00:23:46.359]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:23:46.359 --> 00:23:52.447]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:23:52.987 --> 00:24:01.131]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:06.613]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:24:06.613 --> 00:24:09.615]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:24:12.416 --> 00:24:16.919]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:24:16.919 --> 00:24:17.199]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:24:17.199 --> 00:24:19.181]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:24:19.181 --> 00:24:19.801]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:24:19.801 --> 00:24:20.061]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:43.366 --> 00:24:50.450]  We'll be talking about Bush's speech coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.991]  We'll also take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:52.991 --> 00:25:00.475]  The BBC and the Associated Press are reporting no Al-Qaeda was killed in the airstrikes.
[00:25:00.475 --> 00:25:06.538]  They're also reporting that the Al-Qaeda that they claim went into the country went in there nine years ago.
[00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:08.779]  This is all admitted.
[00:25:09.793 --> 00:25:15.856]  There is no Al-Qaeda, ladies and gentlemen, outside the CIA, Mossad, and MI6, okay?
[00:25:15.856 --> 00:25:17.236]  It doesn't exist.
[00:25:17.236 --> 00:25:26.201]  It's the name of a computer file from the early 1980s for the name for Muslim extremist groups controlled and funded by our criminal government.
[00:25:26.201 --> 00:25:28.001]  By the criminals that have hijacked our government.
[00:25:28.001 --> 00:25:31.083]  Now that's mainstream, scholarly information.
[00:25:31.083 --> 00:25:32.383]  You can go find it.
[00:25:32.383 --> 00:25:33.024]  It's admitted.
[00:25:33.024 --> 00:25:34.644]  The government doesn't debate it.
[00:25:34.644 --> 00:25:38.046]  But they know the general public, again, has no connection to reality.
[00:25:39.025 --> 00:25:40.545]  Criminals operate like this.
[00:25:40.545 --> 00:25:43.806]  They know you're not paying attention to detail.
[00:25:43.806 --> 00:25:54.709]  They know that they can basically just put out simplistic terms and archetypal images, and that it works.
[00:25:54.709 --> 00:25:57.650]  It's just like Panama.
[00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:57.810]  1989.
[00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:02.651]  Remember you heard, oh, the huge military invasion that had taken months to set up, by the way.
[00:26:02.651 --> 00:26:05.972]  A huge attack, concerted, which they later admitted had been planned for months.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.042]  Planned for months because that day they invaded.
[00:26:10.042 --> 00:26:15.286]  That day they invaded, two women at a women's school college were kidnapped.
[00:26:15.286 --> 00:26:17.527]  Well, I have the video of the women going, no, U.S.
[00:26:17.527 --> 00:26:23.252]  troops arrived here right before the attack started, and so they were there to protect us.
[00:26:23.252 --> 00:26:24.933]  We appreciate the protection.
[00:26:24.933 --> 00:26:27.194]  Of course, they were totally ignorant.
[00:26:27.194 --> 00:26:29.176]  Those women were not kidnapped.
[00:26:29.176 --> 00:26:32.218]  It was all made up, because Manuel Noriega
[00:26:32.876 --> 00:26:37.037]  The History Channel admits he was CIA drug dealer and dealt drugs with the U.S.
[00:26:37.037 --> 00:26:37.718]  government.
[00:26:37.718 --> 00:26:47.561]  He started buying palaces, you know, $50 million dollar palaces in Switzerland, and wasn't paying his cut, and openly was threatening the Bushes to expose their drug dealing.
[00:26:47.561 --> 00:26:53.363]  And man, they set up the troops, they went in there and blew that place to kingdom come, Panama City.
[00:26:53.363 --> 00:26:56.144]  Killed tens of thousands.
[00:26:56.144 --> 00:26:59.285]  Of course, none of that was on your news, but we have all the footage of the Panama deception.
[00:27:00.106 --> 00:27:02.807]  And just dead bodies everywhere.
[00:27:02.807 --> 00:27:04.748]  Just jeeps just melted to the ground.
[00:27:04.748 --> 00:27:06.688]  People melted holding on the steering wheels.
[00:27:06.688 --> 00:27:09.289]  Lord knows what did it.
[00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:11.730]  And that was it.
[00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.570]  I mean, that's how they operate.
[00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:15.131]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[00:27:15.131 --> 00:27:18.332]  You've got a government that has developed stability.
[00:27:18.332 --> 00:27:19.612]  Women can walk on the streets.
[00:27:19.612 --> 00:27:21.793]  Industry was starting to build up.
[00:27:21.793 --> 00:27:24.894]  And the warlords have been kicked out, so they ran to a nearby country.
[00:27:25.794 --> 00:27:27.656]  Had a big meeting in Ethiopia.
[00:27:27.656 --> 00:27:30.998]  The Ethiopians, U.S.-backed, with the very same warlords.
[00:27:30.998 --> 00:27:32.400]  The very same!
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.142]  We had a guest on covering the Shestria, but it's in the news today.
[00:27:35.142 --> 00:27:41.307]  That, well, these are the same warlord groups, but, you know, they're fighting Al-Qaeda now, so they're good!
[00:27:41.307 --> 00:27:42.148]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:27:42.148 --> 00:27:46.851]  And then you read, oh, nine years since these supposed Al-Qaeda guys traveled there.
[00:27:46.851 --> 00:27:49.754]  And, oh, they're really British, and people are saying they're really British agents.
[00:27:50.586 --> 00:27:54.127]  Just like the head of the 7-7 bombings, Rashida Swat.
[00:27:54.127 --> 00:27:54.447]  Remember?
[00:27:54.447 --> 00:27:55.787]  And he's MI6 admitted.
[00:27:55.787 --> 00:28:03.229]  We've had the former FBI Justice Department's head anti-terror expert on to tell you that.
[00:28:03.229 --> 00:28:05.009]  I mean, this is how they operate.
[00:28:05.009 --> 00:28:07.570]  They can just say, I mean, what's next?
[00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.030]  France has Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.390]  Attack!
[00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.891]  There were three Al-Qaeda there.
[00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:13.711]  It's like Fallujah.
[00:28:14.992 --> 00:28:18.555]  Less than a dozen people hang and kill four contractors.
[00:28:18.555 --> 00:28:22.919]  And so they literally level the entire city.
[00:28:22.919 --> 00:28:26.403]  So next time there's a murder in, say, New York, you know, what do you do?
[00:28:26.403 --> 00:28:28.765]  Just level the whole city?
[00:28:28.765 --> 00:28:30.306]  But again, they've been dehumanized.
[00:28:30.306 --> 00:28:34.010]  They're the Islamo-fascists that want to kill us.
[00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:40.696]  No, they're people living at caveman level with their children with swollen bellies, starving to death, with no medical care.
[00:28:41.733 --> 00:28:46.656]  Walking around out in fields with unexploded cluster bomb bomblets blowing their legs off.
[00:28:46.656 --> 00:28:49.797]  Blowing their little feet off.
[00:28:49.797 --> 00:28:59.542]  And most of them still dream of America as some mythical, incredible, enchanted land and run around going USA with little American flags, you scumbag neocon followers.
[00:28:59.542 --> 00:29:04.025]  You don't care about our troops that got killed in Somalia.
[00:29:04.025 --> 00:29:06.486]  You're just a scum.
[00:29:08.078 --> 00:29:09.319]  I mean, I think about it.
[00:29:09.319 --> 00:29:12.341]  These are admittedly the people that did this.
[00:29:12.341 --> 00:29:24.008]  But by the time it gets on Sean Hannity, the national story is that it was three Al Qaeda operatives just went into the country and were hiding there so we had to blow it up.
[00:29:24.008 --> 00:29:26.309]  Attack three cities.
[00:29:26.309 --> 00:29:26.910]  Kill hundreds.
[00:29:30.373 --> 00:29:31.934]  But that isn't enough.
[00:29:31.934 --> 00:29:33.255]  That lie isn't enough.
[00:29:33.255 --> 00:29:47.382]  Then, for propaganda purposes, they get on Limbaugh and Hannity and Beck and all the shows, Bortz, and they get on there and they say, man, we just paid them back for what they did in 1993.
[00:29:50.211 --> 00:29:54.654]  And again, these people calling in, going, I'm glad we're killing them Islamos.
[00:29:54.654 --> 00:29:55.875]  Hit them before they hit us.
[00:29:55.875 --> 00:29:58.096]  They can't find the Horn of Africa.
[00:29:58.096 --> 00:30:00.558]  They don't even know what that is.
[00:30:00.558 --> 00:30:04.520]  Bush thinks Nigeria is a continent.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.402]  You know?
[00:30:07.402 --> 00:30:13.446]  No, it's 248 million people, the most populous African nation on the West Coast.
[00:30:13.446 --> 00:30:15.928]  And I'm not even some geography expert.
[00:30:15.928 --> 00:30:17.289]  I mean, there's just...
[00:30:18.126 --> 00:30:19.067]  You're idiots!
[00:30:19.067 --> 00:30:21.630]  And you think you're gonna be free being that ignorant?
[00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:25.876]  Ha!
[00:30:25.876 --> 00:30:27.277]  We're on the march.
[00:30:27.277 --> 00:30:29.800]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.504]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:35.498 --> 00:30:36.539]  Dead Anderson for Midas.
[00:30:36.539 --> 00:30:36.940]  January 11, 2007.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.120]  Gold 61180.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.642]  Ounce gold coins 33220, 31865 for half, 15932 per quarter ounce.
[00:30:38.642 --> 00:30:38.823]  That's 63220, 31865, 15932.
[00:30:50.418 --> 00:30:51.779]  Tyson closes the gold window.
[00:30:51.779 --> 00:30:53.440]  Fiat currency.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:53.521]  1920s.
[00:30:53.521 --> 00:30:56.723]  The German mark explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[00:30:56.723 --> 00:30:57.804]  1995.
[00:30:57.804 --> 00:31:00.426]  Gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[00:31:00.426 --> 00:31:00.907]  1997.
[00:31:00.907 --> 00:31:03.709]  Gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[00:31:03.709 --> 00:31:04.490]  1998.
[00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.272]  Gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[00:31:07.272 --> 00:31:07.532]  2002.
[00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:10.314]  The Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[00:31:10.314 --> 00:31:10.414]  2006.
[00:31:10.414 --> 00:31:16.059]  The last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[00:31:16.059 --> 00:31:17.520]  Could government let this happen?
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.542]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[00:31:19.802 --> 00:31:27.087]  Midas has Nick Bereshef's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[00:31:27.087 --> 00:31:28.928]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[00:31:28.928 --> 00:31:30.289]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:30.469]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:31:36.112 --> 00:31:38.013]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[00:31:38.013 --> 00:31:46.978]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[00:31:46.978 --> 00:31:53.121]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[00:31:53.121 --> 00:32:00.485]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[00:32:00.865 --> 00:32:06.528]  Davis Products is offering high quality solid cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag.

[00:33:39.924 --> 00:33:41.826]  I can't help myself.
[00:33:41.826 --> 00:33:44.027]  I'm going to roll part of this.
[00:33:44.027 --> 00:33:47.269]  We'll play a bush clip and we'll go to your calls.
[00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.551]  Got a big guest coming up as well.
[00:34:07.551 --> 00:34:08.832]  Stay with us.
[00:34:08.832 --> 00:34:10.133]  I got a message for the government.
[00:34:34.346 --> 00:34:35.787]  You can die or lose commission.
[00:34:35.787 --> 00:34:38.429]  It's all a part of fightin' Devil's Save Mind Control.
[00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:40.992]  And all about the battle for your body, mind, and soul.
[00:34:40.992 --> 00:34:43.754]  And now I'm hopin' you don't close your mind so they shape ya.
[00:34:43.754 --> 00:34:46.276]  Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us aids, and raped us.
[00:34:46.276 --> 00:34:48.958]  Another push season mean another war for profit.
[00:34:48.958 --> 00:34:51.340]  All in secret so the public never get to stop it.
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.143]  The Illuminati, Triple Six, all connected.
[00:34:54.143 --> 00:34:56.805]  So the folks, they control the race and take elections.
[00:34:56.805 --> 00:34:59.367]  It's the Skull and Bones Remakes and Kill Committee.
[00:34:59.367 --> 00:35:01.649]  See the dragon gettin' deep in every city.
[00:35:01.949 --> 00:35:07.174]  What would you do if you knew all the things we never knew?
[00:35:07.174 --> 00:35:09.896]  Would you stand up for truth?
[00:35:09.896 --> 00:35:12.518]  Or would you turn away truth?
[00:35:12.518 --> 00:35:17.622]  And then what if we told all of the things that's wrong?
[00:35:17.622 --> 00:35:19.664]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[00:35:20.699 --> 00:35:25.140]  Now ask yourself, who's the one with the most to gain?
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.881]  For 9-11, most people couldn't stand his name.
[00:35:27.881 --> 00:35:30.722]  Now even now, he's waving flags like they lost their mind.
[00:35:30.722 --> 00:35:33.263]  Everybody got opinions, but don't know the time.
[00:35:33.263 --> 00:35:35.724]  Cause America's been took, it's plain to see.
[00:35:35.724 --> 00:35:40.585]  The oldest trick in the book is make your enemy a phony evil so the government can do its dirt.
[00:35:40.985 --> 00:35:43.448]  And take over your freedom, lock and load, beat and search.
[00:35:43.448 --> 00:35:46.151]  Ain't nothing changed, but more colored people locked in prison.
[00:35:46.151 --> 00:35:48.793]  These pigs still beat us, but it seems we forgetting.
[00:35:48.793 --> 00:35:51.816]  But I remember 4 September, how these devils do it.
[00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:53.999]  Giuliani, ask Diallo how he doing.
[00:35:53.999 --> 00:35:56.721]  We in the streets, holler, jail to the thief, follow.
[00:35:56.721 --> 00:35:59.144]  Waving flags, bring these dragons to their knees.
[00:35:59.144 --> 00:36:01.486]  Oil, blood, money, make these killers ride cold.
[00:36:01.486 --> 00:36:03.909]  Suspicious suicide, people dying, never told.
[00:36:04.609 --> 00:36:08.792]  Again, glad that you joined us on this live Thursday edition.
[00:36:08.792 --> 00:36:10.473]  Here's the Associated Press article.
[00:36:10.473 --> 00:36:11.573]  I dug it out of the stack.
[00:36:24.825 --> 00:36:25.426]  U.S.
[00:36:25.426 --> 00:36:26.466]  official!
[00:36:26.466 --> 00:36:29.968]  No Al-Qaeda suspects killed in Somalia airstrikes.
[00:36:29.968 --> 00:36:37.993]  I have another AP article that says Al-Qaeda, three Al-Qaeda members entered the country nine years ago.
[00:36:37.993 --> 00:36:49.720]  So, nine years later, they're going to randomly attack the government compounds of the new Islamic councils there that are not affiliated with the CIA, and they openly... I went and pulled it up.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.520]  I knew what I'd find.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.182]  Of course, they'd been speaking out, saying 9-11's an inside job, of course.
[00:36:53.962 --> 00:37:15.497]  And they've gone into the legitimate government, and you have the Ethiopian-backed, U.S.-led, this is incredible, very same warlord groups, the very one led by Adid, coming in and attacking right as the airstrikes take place in a concerted effort to do as a coup.
[00:37:17.061 --> 00:37:23.662]  Because our government wants a bunch of scumbag warlords in there, who are in control, and who'll just keep, again, balkanization.
[00:37:23.662 --> 00:37:27.283]  Of course they want three different groups of warlords fighting with each other.
[00:37:27.283 --> 00:37:33.084]  And if one warlord starts getting too strong, they'll go in and blow them up to pieces.
[00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:35.724]  It's to keep that country down.
[00:37:35.724 --> 00:37:36.744]  Period.
[00:37:36.744 --> 00:37:38.725]  It's not a country, it's squalor.
[00:37:38.725 --> 00:37:43.306]  It's a bunch of blown out cities for 30 years, a bunch of people killing each other.
[00:37:43.306 --> 00:37:45.206]  And the West making sure it continues.
[00:37:46.209 --> 00:38:02.744]  Man, and then they tell the idiot public, oh, number two Al-Qaeda killed, number two Al-Qaeda killed, and always, three days later, four days later, a day later, oh, quietly though, again, small retraction, nobody reads the retractions, oh, no, there was no Al-Qaeda.
[00:38:02.744 --> 00:38:09.089]  Just like, oh, those girls in Panama weren't kidnapped, but we had a huge invasion force ready.
[00:38:09.089 --> 00:38:10.491]  Do you like being lied to?
[00:38:12.347 --> 00:38:15.109]  And they think of you as the Somalis, too.
[00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:19.752]  Your forefathers fought and died and were mean and aggressive and owned guns.
[00:38:19.752 --> 00:38:21.053]  And weren't cowards.
[00:38:21.053 --> 00:38:22.914]  And so you were able to get a little bit.
[00:38:22.914 --> 00:38:26.176]  You were able to be left alone, have a business, make some money.
[00:38:26.176 --> 00:38:27.817]  And so we developed a big middle class.
[00:38:27.817 --> 00:38:30.659]  We were never perfect, but we were as free as the world's ever seen.
[00:38:30.659 --> 00:38:33.241]  And so 4% of the population had half the wealth.
[00:38:33.241 --> 00:38:34.522]  We were rolling in wealth.
[00:38:34.522 --> 00:38:37.724]  And so the global criminals came in, bought up our politicians, took over.
[00:38:38.914 --> 00:38:50.782]  And now they're debasing all that, now we're the biggest debtor nation, the dumbest people in the industrialized world, and they've ruined this and now we're just a husk, but they know that when it finally implodes, we're going to throw fits.
[00:38:50.782 --> 00:38:59.707]  So they've got a huge police state in place, and they're trying to build it and build it and build it, legitimize torture, secret arrest, everything else, so when they implode it, they can keep control.
[00:38:59.707 --> 00:39:02.349]  And they write that in the Times of London, the Financial Times.
[00:39:02.689 --> 00:39:12.258]  They say the global elite is imploding things to consolidate, but this implosion will be so big it may even destroy many of the higher-level servant elites.
[00:39:12.258 --> 00:39:15.842]  And by that we're talking about billionaires and people.
[00:39:15.842 --> 00:39:17.564]  They're high-level servant elites.
[00:39:17.564 --> 00:39:20.647]  They're not even in the elite.
[00:39:20.647 --> 00:39:20.867]  Okay?
[00:39:22.034 --> 00:39:26.218]  They don't own half of Canada and large portions of the U.S.
[00:39:26.218 --> 00:39:27.079]  and Australia.
[00:39:27.079 --> 00:39:29.140]  They don't own whole oil companies.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:34.846]  They don't literally endow all the major universities and own the roads like they do in England and Australia.
[00:39:34.846 --> 00:39:36.067]  The Queen owns it!
[00:39:36.067 --> 00:39:41.031]  Every week she'll just shut down major roads to let everybody know she owns them!
[00:39:41.031 --> 00:39:43.033]  Every day you're in London, she shuts down different roads.
[00:39:43.033 --> 00:39:45.255]  Well, the Queen says you can't use her roads today!
[00:39:46.833 --> 00:39:54.097]  Oh, the whole river is shut down because the Queen says she's just exercising authority!
[00:39:54.097 --> 00:39:55.758]  No, no, she doesn't have any power.
[00:39:55.758 --> 00:39:57.278]  The tabloids say so.
[00:39:57.278 --> 00:40:01.440]  They own the major tabloids in England.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.562]  What the youngest prince does under Queen Elizabeth.
[00:40:04.562 --> 00:40:08.104]  And they make money off putting themselves down.
[00:40:08.104 --> 00:40:10.585]  They're slick, folks.
[00:40:10.585 --> 00:40:12.146]  That's why they're in control, okay?
[00:40:13.237 --> 00:40:18.801]  It's why they wear big red capes and big jeweled crowns and you bow to them!
[00:40:18.801 --> 00:40:23.784]  They know what they're doing!
[00:40:23.784 --> 00:40:26.966]  I got this George Carlin clip and I keep promising to play it.
[00:40:26.966 --> 00:40:27.727]  I had it yesterday.
[00:40:27.727 --> 00:40:29.208]  We had to cut out all the profanity.
[00:40:29.208 --> 00:40:31.269]  But I mean, this is somebody telling it like it is.
[00:40:31.269 --> 00:40:33.611]  I'm going to play that Carlin and then we'll go to the calls.
[00:40:33.611 --> 00:40:37.273]  Do you have that Carlin?
[00:40:37.273 --> 00:40:37.914]  He's pulling it up.
[00:40:37.914 --> 00:40:39.875]  I just suddenly want to play it.
[00:40:39.875 --> 00:40:42.377]  But this is George Carlin just about a year ago.
[00:40:44.059 --> 00:40:45.180]  Telling it like it is.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.903]  I don't agree with everything George Carlin says.
[00:40:48.903 --> 00:40:53.366]  But one of my employees, one of my staff, actually knows George Carlin.
[00:40:53.366 --> 00:40:56.148]  He was from Fort Worth, I guess, and they know him.
[00:40:56.148 --> 00:40:58.530]  Side issue, here's George Carlin.
[00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.111]  This is exactly how the world works.
[00:41:00.111 --> 00:41:01.652]  This is absolutely true.
[00:41:01.652 --> 00:41:02.553]  Every word of it, here it is.
[00:41:03.404 --> 00:41:05.625]  National compulsive consumers.
[00:41:05.625 --> 00:41:09.266]  They think of that as their national pride.
[00:41:09.266 --> 00:41:10.706]  It's their civic duty.
[00:41:10.706 --> 00:41:11.627]  Consumption.
[00:41:11.627 --> 00:41:13.087]  This is the new national pastime.
[00:41:13.087 --> 00:41:14.568]  It's consumption.
[00:41:14.568 --> 00:41:19.869]  The only true lasting American value that's left, buying things.
[00:41:19.869 --> 00:41:20.770]  Buying things.
[00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.590]  People spending money they don't have on things they don't need.
[00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.731]  Money they don't have on things they don't need.
[00:41:25.731 --> 00:41:30.313]  So they can max out their credit cards and spend the rest of their lives paying 18% interest on something that costs $12.50.
[00:41:32.077 --> 00:41:34.539]  And they didn't like it when they got it home anyway.
[00:41:34.539 --> 00:41:35.539]  Not too bright, folks.
[00:41:35.539 --> 00:41:44.745]  But if you talk to one of them about this, if you isolate one of them, you sit him down rationally and you talk to him about the low IQs and the dumb behavior and the bad decisions, right away they start talking about education.
[00:41:44.745 --> 00:41:46.086]  That's the big answer to everything.
[00:41:46.086 --> 00:41:46.946]  Education.
[00:41:46.946 --> 00:41:48.647]  They say, we need more money for education.
[00:41:48.647 --> 00:41:51.929]  We need more books, more teachers, more classrooms, more schools.
[00:41:51.929 --> 00:41:53.831]  We need more testing for the kids.
[00:41:53.831 --> 00:41:58.213]  You say to them, well, you know, we've tried all of that and the kids still can't pass the test.
[00:41:58.213 --> 00:41:59.394]  You say, oh, don't you worry about that.
[00:41:59.394 --> 00:42:00.835]  We're going to lower the passing grades.
[00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:05.571]  That's what they do in a lot of these schools now, they lower the passing grades so more kids can pass.
[00:42:05.571 --> 00:42:12.980]  More kids pass, the school looks good, everybody's happy, the IQ of the country slips another two or three points, and pretty soon all you'll need to get into college is a pencil!
[00:42:14.432 --> 00:42:18.775]  And everyone wonders why 17 other countries graduate more scientists than we do.
[00:42:18.775 --> 00:42:20.116]  Education!
[00:42:20.116 --> 00:42:21.277]  Politicians know that word.
[00:42:21.277 --> 00:42:22.417]  They use it on you.
[00:42:22.417 --> 00:42:25.620]  Politicians have traditionally hidden behind three things.
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.221]  The flag, the Bible, and children.
[00:42:28.221 --> 00:42:29.702]  No child left behind.
[00:42:29.702 --> 00:42:30.963]  No child left behind.
[00:42:30.963 --> 00:42:32.004]  Oh, really?
[00:42:32.004 --> 00:42:34.906]  Well, it wasn't long ago you were talking about giving kids a head start.
[00:42:34.906 --> 00:42:35.566]  Head start?
[00:42:35.566 --> 00:42:36.507]  Left behind?
[00:42:36.507 --> 00:42:37.948]  Someone's losing ground here.
[00:42:39.838 --> 00:42:40.679]  But there's a reason.
[00:42:40.679 --> 00:42:41.579]  There's a reason.
[00:42:41.579 --> 00:42:42.880]  There's a reason for this.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:48.863]  There's a reason education sucks, and it's the same reason that it will never, ever, ever be fixed.
[00:42:48.863 --> 00:42:50.364]  It's never going to get any better.
[00:42:50.364 --> 00:42:51.525]  Don't look for it.
[00:42:51.525 --> 00:42:53.126]  Be happy with what you got.
[00:42:53.126 --> 00:42:56.748]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[00:42:56.748 --> 00:42:58.709]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:00.650]  The big, the wealthy,
[00:43:02.593 --> 00:43:08.640]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.981]  Forget the politicians.
[00:43:09.981 --> 00:43:11.763]  They're irrelevant.
[00:43:11.763 --> 00:43:15.687]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[00:43:15.687 --> 00:43:16.108]  You don't.
[00:43:16.903 --> 00:43:18.264]  You have no choice.
[00:43:18.264 --> 00:43:19.505]  You have owners.
[00:43:19.505 --> 00:43:21.046]  They own you.
[00:43:21.046 --> 00:43:22.587]  They own everything.
[00:43:22.587 --> 00:43:24.588]  They own all the important land.
[00:43:24.588 --> 00:43:26.370]  They own and control the corporations.
[00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:29.872]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[00:43:29.872 --> 00:43:31.773]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[00:43:31.773 --> 00:43:38.758]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all the news and information you get to hear.
[00:43:38.758 --> 00:43:40.920]  They got you by the balls!
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:45.023]  They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying,
[00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:48.066]  To get what they want.
[00:43:48.066 --> 00:43:49.607]  Well, we know what they want.
[00:43:49.607 --> 00:43:52.390]  They want more for themselves and less for everybody else.
[00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:54.252]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[00:43:54.252 --> 00:43:57.756]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[00:43:57.756 --> 00:44:01.740]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:02.941]  They're not interested in that.
[00:44:02.941 --> 00:44:04.262]  That doesn't help them.
[00:44:04.262 --> 00:44:06.144]  That's against their interest.
[00:44:06.144 --> 00:44:07.145]  That's right.
[00:44:07.145 --> 00:44:07.786]  You know something?
[00:44:09.028 --> 00:44:15.250]  They don't want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table to figure out how badly they're getting to play a system that threw them overboard 30 years ago.
[00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:16.230]  They don't want that.
[00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.070]  You know what they want?
[00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:19.611]  They want obedient workers.
[00:44:19.611 --> 00:44:21.432]  Obedient workers.
[00:44:21.432 --> 00:44:32.695]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly easier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime,
[00:44:33.035 --> 00:44:35.797]  And the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[00:44:35.797 --> 00:44:39.339]  And now they're coming for your social security money.
[00:44:39.339 --> 00:44:40.980]  They want your retirement money.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.581]  They want it back.
[00:44:42.581 --> 00:44:45.522]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[00:44:45.522 --> 00:44:46.203]  And you know something?
[00:44:46.203 --> 00:44:46.883]  They'll get it.
[00:44:46.883 --> 00:44:48.804]  They'll get it all from you sooner or later.
[00:44:48.804 --> 00:44:50.385]  Because they own this place.
[00:44:50.385 --> 00:44:52.266]  It's a big club.
[00:44:52.266 --> 00:44:54.587]  And you ain't in it!
[00:44:54.587 --> 00:44:57.249]  You and I are not in the big club.
[00:44:57.947 --> 00:45:02.716]  By the way, it's the same big club they used to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe.
[00:45:02.716 --> 00:45:07.024]  All day long, beating you over the head in their media, telling you what to believe, what to think, and what to buy.
[00:45:07.024 --> 00:45:09.027]  The table is tilted, folks.
[00:45:09.027 --> 00:45:09.929]  The game is rigged.
[00:45:10.552 --> 00:45:12.534]  And nobody seems to notice.
[00:45:12.534 --> 00:45:14.456]  Nobody seems to care.
[00:45:14.456 --> 00:45:15.957]  Good, honest, hard-working people.
[00:45:15.957 --> 00:45:18.900]  White-collar, blue-collar, doesn't matter what color shirt you have on.
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:21.222]  Good, honest, hard-working people continue.
[00:45:21.222 --> 00:45:22.883]  These are people of modest beings.
[00:45:22.883 --> 00:45:26.246]  Continue to elect these rich people who don't give a f**k about them.
[00:45:26.246 --> 00:45:27.788]  They don't give a f**k about you.
[00:45:27.788 --> 00:45:29.289]  They don't give a f**k about you.
[00:45:29.289 --> 00:45:31.111]  They don't care about you.
[00:45:31.111 --> 00:45:32.092]  At all.
[00:45:32.092 --> 00:45:33.073]  At all.
[00:45:33.073 --> 00:45:33.553]  At all.
[00:45:33.553 --> 00:45:34.975]  Yeah.
[00:45:34.975 --> 00:45:36.336]  You know?
[00:45:38.641 --> 00:45:41.503]  And nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care.
[00:45:41.503 --> 00:45:42.804]  That's what the owners count on.
[00:45:42.804 --> 00:45:49.348]  The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant, because the owners of this country know the truth.
[00:45:49.348 --> 00:45:53.090]  It's called the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:58.073]  It's called the American Dream, you've got to be asleep to believe it.
[00:45:58.073 --> 00:46:03.756]  Carlin's so talented, I don't know why he has to pepper in all the profanity, but I wanted you to hear that.
[00:46:03.756 --> 00:46:04.837]  And that's why I get angry.
[00:46:04.837 --> 00:46:06.398]  You can hear how cynical he is.
[00:46:07.975 --> 00:46:09.135]  But it isn't just the elite.
[00:46:09.135 --> 00:46:09.816]  You know, it's us.
[00:46:09.816 --> 00:46:11.596]  We've gotten spoiled.
[00:46:11.596 --> 00:46:14.417]  We've gotten bad.
[00:46:14.417 --> 00:46:17.418]  That's what I started to allude to yesterday.
[00:46:17.418 --> 00:46:27.461]  That, you know, just because the media is lying and twisting and spinning and the government's corrupt, doesn't necessarily mean that everybody in the alternative movement is good.
[00:46:27.461 --> 00:46:34.903]  Doesn't necessarily mean that everybody out there in the alternative is telling the truth.
[00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:46.077]  Or that every quack product they've got, you know, some special beam that's going to heal your cancer, or some magical cream that's going to heal you.
[00:46:46.077 --> 00:46:50.359]  You know, I don't like being associated with that, and I've said that on the record.
[00:46:50.359 --> 00:46:53.662]  And I don't like being associated with other things.
[00:46:53.662 --> 00:47:03.908]  And even though my show completely dwarfs, just on the internet alone, with listeners on the internet, ten times the biggest any other show out there.
[00:47:03.908 --> 00:47:04.629]  Ten times!
[00:47:05.569 --> 00:47:06.830]  Ten times!
[00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:07.691]  That's conservative.
[00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:09.232]  That's just when my show's on.
[00:47:09.232 --> 00:47:11.114]  It re-airs 24 hours a day now.
[00:47:11.114 --> 00:47:14.276]  I actually count, it was like over a hundred times.
[00:47:14.276 --> 00:47:16.918]  If you count all that.
[00:47:16.918 --> 00:47:17.779]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:47:17.779 --> 00:47:23.704]  It's like, you know, I want to expose it.
[00:47:23.704 --> 00:47:32.871]  And then I sit here and I think, yeah, but, you know, in the end that probably won't even do any good because we're scum.
[00:47:32.871 --> 00:47:34.653]  I mean, you know, the public's dumbed down.
[00:47:36.907 --> 00:47:55.644]  I mean, you know, the Patriot Movement is, I guess, made of people a step above in many respects, but a lot of them are mentally ill and just like fighting and garbage and being scammed.
[00:47:55.644 --> 00:48:00.108]  I mean, really, I'm just at the end of my rope with all of it.
[00:48:00.108 --> 00:48:01.970]  I don't want anybody out there to think they're so special.
[00:48:02.828 --> 00:48:04.769]  That it's, you know, just intended for them.
[00:48:04.769 --> 00:48:09.330]  Oh no, it's a whole bunch of people.
[00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:10.670]  I said I'd take your calls.
[00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:11.851]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:48:11.851 --> 00:48:14.872]  I, uh... I mean, we're in deep trouble.
[00:48:14.872 --> 00:48:18.112]  This elite is really corrupt and bad.
[00:48:18.112 --> 00:48:20.613]  And is really doing bad things.
[00:48:20.613 --> 00:48:28.716]  And, uh... We need to get focused on fighting the New World Order and focused on taking action against it.
[00:48:28.716 --> 00:48:29.996]  Joe, where you calling from today?
[00:48:31.528 --> 00:48:32.669]  I'm up in Pittsburgh.
[00:48:32.669 --> 00:48:35.110]  What's on your mind, Joe?
[00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:39.153]  Well, I wanted to get into the whole allergy thing that you're talking about.
[00:48:39.153 --> 00:48:42.295]  You say it's going on down there in Austin.
[00:48:42.295 --> 00:48:43.756]  Yeah, it just gets worse and worse.
[00:48:43.756 --> 00:48:45.917]  I mean, you know, ten years ago, hardly anybody had it.
[00:48:45.917 --> 00:48:47.498]  Now everybody's got it.
[00:48:47.498 --> 00:48:48.959]  I mean, everybody!
[00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:53.262]  And to me, it gets worse and worse during the Cedar Fever thing.
[00:48:53.262 --> 00:48:54.703]  Well, I don't know what's going on with me.
[00:48:54.703 --> 00:48:59.106]  I had allergies when I was younger, and I went for two years when I was probably about seven and eight.
[00:48:59.594 --> 00:49:08.380]  Once every two weeks to get allergy shots, which I don't know if that was... I don't know what they were giving me, but... Did it work?
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:12.463]  Yeah, I mean, I was allergic to dust, cats, everything, and... I'm gonna have to go get those.
[00:49:12.463 --> 00:49:18.567]  I don't have allergies anymore, but the past two days, I... See, I just don't go to doctors, so it's so alien.
[00:49:18.567 --> 00:49:20.688]  My wife keeps going, go to the doctor, go to the doctor.
[00:49:20.688 --> 00:49:22.469]  I go, huh, doctor?
[00:49:22.469 --> 00:49:23.190]  But I'm gonna have to.
[00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:25.351]  This is just unbelievable.
[00:49:25.351 --> 00:49:28.133]  Yeah, there's a lot of people up here, like my sister and
[00:49:28.846 --> 00:49:32.049]  My brother-in-law and their brand new daughter.
[00:49:32.049 --> 00:49:34.511]  Everybody's got something going around here.
[00:49:34.511 --> 00:49:36.493]  My own mother, my girlfriend.
[00:49:36.493 --> 00:49:45.101]  I thought maybe it was just some kind of flu or cold or something, but it doesn't feel like anything for myself.
[00:49:45.101 --> 00:49:47.764]  It doesn't feel like anything that I've really experienced.
[00:49:47.764 --> 00:49:48.945]  I'm just clogged up here.
[00:49:50.416 --> 00:49:52.298]  He's constantly sneezing and tingling.
[00:49:52.298 --> 00:49:53.859]  That's exactly what I feel like.
[00:49:53.859 --> 00:49:56.401]  At about 11 o'clock each night, I can't breathe.
[00:49:56.401 --> 00:49:57.642]  I just start hacking them.
[00:49:57.642 --> 00:50:00.204]  It's like the time a bunch of bees chased me.
[00:50:00.204 --> 00:50:02.866]  I was digging in the backyard for my parents.
[00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:07.430]  And the bees, like in a movie or in a cartoon, suddenly like, you know, hundreds of them were attacking me.
[00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:08.030]  And I ran.
[00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:09.652]  I had all these stingers in my head.
[00:50:09.652 --> 00:50:11.994]  I've never been allergic to bees before or since.
[00:50:11.994 --> 00:50:13.475]  It was that one time.
[00:50:13.475 --> 00:50:15.997]  And I started swelling up red and I couldn't breathe.
[00:50:15.997 --> 00:50:18.279]  Man, that's what it feels like every night now.
[00:50:19.102 --> 00:50:19.802]  Every night.
[00:50:19.802 --> 00:50:24.545]  And the reason I'm talking about it, folks, is I'm wanting to cure something here.
[00:50:24.545 --> 00:50:26.686]  And, uh, it's just unbelievable.
[00:50:26.686 --> 00:50:29.668]  I mean, this is everybody, though.
[00:50:29.668 --> 00:50:35.911]  I mean, you know, everybody I know here in Austin, everybody is sick.
[00:50:35.911 --> 00:50:37.472]  Wonderful world we live in.
[00:50:37.472 --> 00:50:38.672]  Something's going on, man.
[00:50:38.672 --> 00:50:41.814]  My grandmother lived here from the time she was like 18.
[00:50:41.814 --> 00:50:44.635]  My mother was born here.
[00:50:44.635 --> 00:50:47.497]  And, uh, you know, lived here most of her life.
[00:50:48.536 --> 00:50:52.238]  They never had allergies and now they've got allergies?
[00:50:52.238 --> 00:50:56.200]  I mean, what's going on here?
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:00.983]  Has it popped in your head that there might be a correlation between all the chemtrails going around?
[00:51:00.983 --> 00:51:02.824]  And all the dead birds?
[00:51:02.824 --> 00:51:03.685]  And I don't know.
[00:51:03.685 --> 00:51:04.465]  Man, I don't know.
[00:51:04.465 --> 00:51:06.986]  But let me tell you, this doesn't feel like anything I've ever felt.
[00:51:06.986 --> 00:51:08.407]  And it makes me irritable, too.
[00:51:08.407 --> 00:51:14.271]  Like, I mean, I get... Like, usually I get allergies, I feel bad for a few days, go take a nap, feel okay, just kind of have a headache.
[00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:16.652]  This is like... Makes me mad!
[00:51:17.333 --> 00:51:18.274]  I appreciate your call.
[00:51:18.274 --> 00:51:24.941]  I mean, I'm just... I don't know.
[00:51:24.941 --> 00:51:25.682]  Alright, we'll come back.
[00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:32.129]  Obviously, nobody wants to talk about Bush and his ridiculous speech last night, but we'll continue with your phone calls.
[00:51:32.129 --> 00:51:32.510]  Stay with us.
[00:51:38.653 --> 00:51:42.155]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:42.155 --> 00:51:44.457]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:44.457 --> 00:51:52.102]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:52.785 --> 00:52:00.247]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:52:00.247 --> 00:52:11.970]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:15.950]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:18.211]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:52:18.211 --> 00:52:22.032]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:38.316 --> 00:52:41.377]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:52:41.377 --> 00:52:45.938]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:52:45.938 --> 00:52:47.099]  So what do you do?

[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.761]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:54:46.048 --> 00:54:46.608]  Welcome back.
[00:54:46.608 --> 00:54:47.468]  Let's go to your calls.
[00:54:47.468 --> 00:54:47.948]  Lonnie.
[00:54:47.948 --> 00:54:50.389]  Lonnie, where are you calling from today?
[00:54:51.397 --> 00:54:51.977]  Well, I'm sorry.
[00:54:51.977 --> 00:54:53.238]  Go ahead there, Alex.
[00:54:53.238 --> 00:54:53.518]  No, no.
[00:54:53.518 --> 00:54:54.919]  Where are you calling from today?
[00:54:54.919 --> 00:54:59.101]  I'm calling from the cold country of Northern Michigan out here by Mackinac Island.
[00:54:59.101 --> 00:55:00.201]  What's on your mind?
[00:55:00.201 --> 00:55:02.262]  Well, I'll tell you, there's a whole lot, buddy.
[00:55:02.262 --> 00:55:05.784]  First of all, I just want to tell you that I did order a lot of your tapes.
[00:55:05.784 --> 00:55:09.146]  Jerry Storm, the last one, and I got a bunch of them from you and Tex Meyers.
[00:55:09.146 --> 00:55:10.647]  So, very informative.
[00:55:10.647 --> 00:55:12.228]  Thank you, sir, for your support.
[00:55:12.228 --> 00:55:13.088]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:13.088 --> 00:55:20.031]  I just want to say, for the record, we shouldn't be too hard on Mr. Bush up by the burning bush, our neighbor from Washington, because, you know, I don't think he could handle that.
[00:55:20.031 --> 00:55:20.572]  You know what I mean?
[00:55:21.363 --> 00:55:29.926]  But anyways, where are they right now as far as the FEMA camp up there in Tyler, Texas when Kevin was doing the taping with the children?
[00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:32.526]  Well, we put that report out for free.
[00:55:32.526 --> 00:55:34.447]  We went and shot it and edited it and put it out.
[00:55:34.447 --> 00:55:35.907]  It's on JonesReport.com.
[00:55:35.907 --> 00:55:37.828]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:55:37.828 --> 00:55:46.130]  Just type in Taylor Camp into Google Video and you can watch the report for free.
[00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:47.871]  And they've got, other than Mexican
[00:55:49.418 --> 00:55:52.340]  Immigration violators they claim there, but they're taking their U.S.
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:55.581]  born children and giving them the CPS.
[00:55:55.581 --> 00:55:58.022]  They're not giving them due process, but here's the thing.
[00:55:58.022 --> 00:56:03.945]  They admit in the Houston Chronicle that the camps will be used as dual use for U.S.
[00:56:03.945 --> 00:56:07.507]  families during insurrection or during uprisings.
[00:56:07.507 --> 00:56:12.350]  So the point is the government's building these and has them for dual use for the first time in modern U.S.
[00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:13.410]  history.
[00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:16.812]  Just like the CPS up here, they find foster homes for the kids.
[00:56:16.812 --> 00:56:18.953]  Same thing as in Terminus as far as I'm concerned.
[00:56:19.827 --> 00:56:23.149]  You know, maybe not as bad as for the word-wise, you know what I mean?
[00:56:23.149 --> 00:56:28.691]  But yeah, they steal your kids and then they come up with all kinds of accusations to keep the good, you know?
[00:56:28.691 --> 00:56:35.894]  And then they train them, or you know, they brainwash them, then turn them back into society to go against the natural parents, and it never ends.
[00:56:35.894 --> 00:56:37.355]  It's the same nightmare all the time.
[00:56:37.355 --> 00:56:41.597]  In fact, a lot of the CPS workers are kids that were snatched and then brainwashed into cult members.
[00:56:41.597 --> 00:56:42.718]  I appreciate your call.
[00:56:42.718 --> 00:56:44.578]  Good to hear from you.
[00:56:44.578 --> 00:56:47.080]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ben in Delaware.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:47.840]  Ben, how you doing?
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.961]  I always say, Alex, man, it's a great honor to talk to you, man.
[00:56:50.961 --> 00:56:53.581]  I just want to thank you for waking me up a couple months ago there.
[00:56:53.581 --> 00:56:54.821]  I've been a big fan of your show.
[00:56:54.821 --> 00:56:56.922]  I'm just out here trying to spread the word to everybody.
[00:56:56.922 --> 00:57:05.884]  You know, I know, you know, police officials and anybody I know that I come in contact with, trying to, you know, let them know about your show and just, you know, I got terror stormed, letting everybody see that.
[00:57:05.884 --> 00:57:17.366]  But, you know, the real reason I wanted to call you was, I never really planned on calling, but when you described your allergy symptoms this morning, it just struck me because those are the exact same symptoms that I had last summer.
[00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:27.755]  And I'm somebody who's never, ever, ever in their entire life had an allergy problem, and I had about four months of solid, insane, just, you know, incurable...
[00:57:28.468 --> 00:57:30.150]  Allergy, you know, sinus symptoms.
[00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:34.113]  And what my man there from Pittsburgh, Joe, just called and said... Well, something's going on.
[00:57:34.113 --> 00:57:35.574]  Nobody used to have them now.
[00:57:35.574 --> 00:57:39.217]  I mean, this town, it's got to be... I've met no one who isn't sick.
[00:57:39.217 --> 00:57:40.158]  I'm sure people aren't.
[00:57:40.158 --> 00:57:41.859]  So let's say 90%.
[00:57:41.859 --> 00:57:43.821]  I mean, and I've asked 50 people.
[00:57:43.821 --> 00:57:45.622]  I mean, they've all or more.
[00:57:45.622 --> 00:57:47.804]  I mean, it's just everybody feels like crap.
[00:57:47.804 --> 00:57:49.165]  And what is going on?
[00:57:49.165 --> 00:57:51.067]  You know, that's exactly it.
[00:57:51.067 --> 00:57:51.887]  And it was really funny.
[00:57:51.887 --> 00:57:53.249]  It was almost like a sick joke.
[00:57:53.249 --> 00:57:54.129]  I got sick.
[00:57:54.129 --> 00:57:55.290]  And I started going to the doctor.
[00:57:55.290 --> 00:57:57.152]  He starts giving me all these antibiotics and stuff.
[00:57:57.805 --> 00:58:07.397]  It really wasn't affecting me, but everybody I knew was getting the same symptoms and it didn't seem to be like there was really any sort of like, it wasn't like a cold, it's just these allergies that won't go away.
[00:58:08.822 --> 00:58:15.465]  Look, we know that genetically engineered foods then trigger real allergies from other things in the natural environment.
[00:58:15.465 --> 00:58:20.969]  And we know there's thousands and thousands of admitted biological, chemical, and radiological tests over U.S.
[00:58:20.969 --> 00:58:21.789]  cities.
[00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:23.450]  So who knows what they're doing to us?
[00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:26.392]  Who knows what these psychopathic criminals are doing?
[00:58:26.392 --> 00:58:30.554]  Well, all I've got to say is that what's worked for me is to stay away from whatever you've got.
[00:58:30.554 --> 00:58:32.375]  Antibiotics, I would highly not recommend those.
[00:58:34.488 --> 00:58:36.029]  Take a garlic supplement every day.
[00:58:36.029 --> 00:58:36.570]  It cured me.
[00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:37.991]  I eat a lot of garlic.
[00:58:37.991 --> 00:58:42.355]  Only thing I ingest, I don't even dip or smoke off and on.
[00:58:42.355 --> 00:58:43.596]  I've chewed tobacco.
[00:58:43.596 --> 00:58:46.799]  I don't even do that.
[00:58:46.799 --> 00:58:47.760]  I don't even really drink.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:48.681]  I mean, nothing.
[00:58:51.107 --> 00:58:51.627]  I don't know.
[00:58:51.627 --> 00:58:53.228]  I mean, I haven't been to the doctor either.
[00:58:53.228 --> 00:58:55.190]  I might go to an allergen.
[00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:58.712]  The reason I bring it up is, why does the whole city have it?
[00:58:58.712 --> 00:58:59.693]  I appreciate your call.
[00:58:59.693 --> 00:59:00.293]  Good to hear from you.
[00:59:00.293 --> 00:59:03.175]  We're going to come back and go to Eric, Mike, Don, and others.
[00:59:03.175 --> 00:59:04.836]  We've got a big guest coming on.
[00:59:04.836 --> 00:59:07.097]  She's the lady that went up against O'Reilly toe-to-toe.
[00:59:07.097 --> 00:59:09.999]  Remember, I played that clip and analyzed all his lies.
[00:59:09.999 --> 00:59:12.061]  She'll be talking about Bush's speech last night.
[00:59:12.061 --> 00:59:12.501]  Stay with us.

[01:00:25.508 --> 01:00:27.910]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:30.692]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:37.373 --> 01:00:38.674]  Big Brother.
[01:00:38.674 --> 01:00:40.454]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:40.454 --> 01:00:42.215]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:42.215 --> 01:00:43.776]  You want answers?
[01:00:43.776 --> 01:00:45.357]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:45.357 --> 01:00:49.519]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:49.519 --> 01:00:59.444]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:59.444 --> 01:01:03.546]  We've got Samsara Taylor joining us in the next segment.
[01:01:04.321 --> 01:01:08.363]  She went toe-to-toe with O'Reilly and literally cooked his goose.
[01:01:08.363 --> 01:01:13.365]  But O'Reilly stuck to his guns of just name-calling.
[01:01:13.365 --> 01:01:18.867]  They're the folks that shut down the Democrats when they were giving that press conference last week.
[01:01:18.867 --> 01:01:24.069]  And we're going to get her take on Bush's speech and the Democrats last night.
[01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:25.690]  Right now, let's go to Eric in Texas.
[01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:26.570]  Eric, you're on the air.
[01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:26.910]  Welcome.
[01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:28.831]  Thanks for holding.
[01:01:28.831 --> 01:01:29.351]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:01:29.351 --> 01:01:31.732]  This is Eric from Austin.
[01:01:31.732 --> 01:01:33.193]  I'm sorry, Eric from Whitney.
[01:01:33.784 --> 01:01:35.445]  And I'm a long-time listener.
[01:01:35.445 --> 01:01:36.466]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:01:36.466 --> 01:01:37.787]  Good to have you on board, my friend.
[01:01:37.787 --> 01:01:40.268]  What's on your mind?
[01:01:40.268 --> 01:01:40.609]  Great.
[01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:43.450]  I just wanted to tell you that I'm President Obama.
[01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:44.291]  I thought you'd remember.
[01:01:44.291 --> 01:01:46.292]  I've got two questions for you.
[01:01:46.292 --> 01:01:49.254]  They're statements you've made previously online.
[01:01:49.254 --> 01:01:55.398]  You mentioned one time about a law prohibiting the use of any body of water.
[01:01:55.398 --> 01:01:59.521]  Did I misunderstand, or is it such a law?
[01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:03.688]  Well, there's a whole bunch of laws concerning the use of water.
[01:02:03.688 --> 01:02:06.748]  Specifically, narrow it down, what was I talking about?
[01:02:06.748 --> 01:02:13.210]  It was something like they were prohibiting no use whatsoever of... Okay, let me be clear.
[01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:21.092]  The exact same laws, exact same names, or similar, are passed in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, England, U.S.
[01:02:21.092 --> 01:02:26.193]  Okay, so all over the world they're saying you're not allowed to drill a well now.
[01:02:27.472 --> 01:02:31.594]  Without paying a huge fee and without getting a license.
[01:02:31.594 --> 01:02:34.515]  And now they're putting meters on wells in the U.S.
[01:02:34.515 --> 01:02:36.935]  They just announced you've got to do it.
[01:02:36.935 --> 01:02:42.297]  They've also got taxes for rainwater in a bunch of different counties in the country.
[01:02:42.297 --> 01:02:46.739]  And what happens is the big corporations and the think tanks and the lobbying groups, they write
[01:02:47.782 --> 01:03:03.713]  Okay, they write the laws and then they go lobby them to the National Association of Counties, National Association of Cities, National Association of Chiefs of Police, National Association of Governors, and then that's why you have the exact same law all over the world.
[01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:05.795]  And so yes, they're moving to block
[01:03:06.375 --> 01:03:16.121]  And they also have laws where if you've got a puddle on your land anytime in the year, then you can't build on it, then they force you to sell, then they later develop it when people have forgotten about it.
[01:03:16.121 --> 01:03:17.542]  I mean, it's just mafia tactics.
[01:03:17.542 --> 01:03:21.084]  But they found they can't just pull up with guns and say, give us your property.
[01:03:21.084 --> 01:03:25.587]  They've got lots of little excuses and little hoops you've got to jump through.
[01:03:25.587 --> 01:03:28.989]  And then if you stumble, psychologically you think because
[01:03:29.804 --> 01:03:34.465]  You know, that they gave us somewhat of an excuse that somehow it's okay.
[01:03:34.465 --> 01:03:47.869]  So they put their criminality into a projection, you know, a smoke and mirrors program to give it some air of legitimacy.
[01:03:47.869 --> 01:03:50.550]  You know, they put it into a process.
[01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:51.870]  Yeah, color of law.
[01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:53.210]  Color of law.
[01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:55.171]  One other question.
[01:03:55.171 --> 01:03:59.032]  So a couple of years ago you were mentioning an author on the air.
[01:03:59.705 --> 01:04:04.589]  That German people have resisted, you know, after dinner doors.
[01:04:04.589 --> 01:04:06.631]  I've done research and I can't find it.
[01:04:06.631 --> 01:04:08.873]  Can you give me the author's name?
[01:04:08.873 --> 01:04:09.673]  It was a pastor.
[01:04:09.673 --> 01:04:19.581]  You're talking about the one when he said, first they came for... No, I think you're talking about Alexander Sholzhenitsyn talking about the Russians.
[01:04:19.581 --> 01:04:21.463]  Okay, okay, that's what I mean, yes.
[01:04:21.463 --> 01:04:23.625]  Alexander... See, I'm pretty good.
[01:04:23.625 --> 01:04:24.325]  I'm like guessing.
[01:04:24.325 --> 01:04:26.927]  Yeah, Alexander Sholzhenitsyn.
[01:04:26.927 --> 01:04:29.069]  Sholzhenitsyn, I think is how you pronounce it correctly.
[01:04:29.645 --> 01:04:31.386]  I'm not good at these things.
[01:04:31.386 --> 01:04:33.826]  Alexander Shiltson-Eatson, Gulag Archipelago.
[01:04:33.826 --> 01:04:36.147]  Gulag?
[01:04:36.147 --> 01:04:39.568]  Gulag Archipelago.
[01:04:39.568 --> 01:04:40.308]  Okay.
[01:04:40.308 --> 01:04:40.988]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:04:40.988 --> 01:04:42.329]  I appreciate it, and keep up the good work.
[01:04:42.329 --> 01:04:42.769]  Thank you.
[01:04:42.769 --> 01:04:44.869]  Yeah, that's a great quote.
[01:04:44.869 --> 01:04:51.811]  For a few years, we had it at the top of prisonplanet.com, but we tried to make the page simpler to load faster so it's not on there.
[01:04:51.811 --> 01:04:58.293]  Yeah, and I mean, basically, he said, what would happen if... He was talking about... I think he was talking about Leningrad.
[01:04:59.802 --> 01:05:05.746]  What would happen if, when they were coming during the purges, I mean they grabbed like a half million people just in a few months.
[01:05:05.746 --> 01:05:07.146]  Different people every night.
[01:05:07.146 --> 01:05:14.431]  What would happen if we waited on the stairs, in the shadows, in the dark, with our picks, our axes, and you know, fought them?
[01:05:14.431 --> 01:05:17.533]  The secret police would quit going out very quickly.
[01:05:17.533 --> 01:05:22.736]  But no, we sit here like chicken necks, being bullied, and rationalizing, and making excuses.
[01:05:22.736 --> 01:05:25.938]  And we do it on the local level, we do it on the national level.
[01:05:25.938 --> 01:05:26.378]  Stay with us.
[01:05:36.084 --> 01:05:41.892]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:41.892 --> 01:05:49.542]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:50.225 --> 01:05:57.688]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:57.688 --> 01:06:09.413]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:06:09.413 --> 01:06:13.395]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:06:13.395 --> 01:06:15.636]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:06:15.636 --> 01:06:19.478]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:07:32.466 --> 01:07:37.448]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:07:37.448 --> 01:07:40.690]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:43.631]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:48.813]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:07:48.813 --> 01:07:54.496]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:07:54.496 --> 01:07:57.457]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[01:07:57.637 --> 01:07:58.218]  We're good to go.
[01:08:21.039 --> 01:08:29.087]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.

[01:08:30.228 --> 01:08:37.915]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:37.915 --> 01:08:40.198]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:47.447]  Even though the Democrats took control of Congress today, some on the far left are not happy.
[01:08:47.447 --> 01:08:51.715]  When Democratic Congressman Rahm Emanuel tried to give a speech yesterday, here's what happened.
[01:08:53.041 --> 01:08:59.566]  At every step of the... At every... We're going to keep going here.
[01:08:59.566 --> 01:09:03.629]  We're going to have a... Thank you.
[01:09:19.781 --> 01:09:21.682]  Bill Emanuel could not get his remarks out.
[01:09:21.682 --> 01:09:27.183]  Joining us from Washington, Sunsara Taylor, prominent member of the far-left group, The World Can't Wait.
[01:09:27.183 --> 01:09:30.944]  Why some members of your group were in that mob?
[01:09:30.944 --> 01:09:32.385]  We're going to play a little bit of this later.
[01:09:32.385 --> 01:09:34.425]  A few days ago, I played it and broke down all the lies.
[01:09:34.425 --> 01:09:36.506]  But first, he says the group has 50 members.
[01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:37.126]  That's not true.
[01:09:37.126 --> 01:09:39.047]  It's one of the biggest groups in the country.
[01:09:39.047 --> 01:09:42.988]  Now, they've got millions of people with the help of other groups out on the streets.
[01:09:42.988 --> 01:09:46.469]  This group's organized rallies here in Austin with thousands and thousands.
[01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:56.626]  And so O'Reilly says they're a minority, they're far left, she's crazy, she's a kook, that the majority of Americans are pro-war.
[01:09:56.626 --> 01:10:00.169]  I've got polls as high as 82% against the war.
[01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:02.471]  Most of them are in the high 70s.
[01:10:02.471 --> 01:10:04.052]  Most conservatives are against it.
[01:10:04.052 --> 01:10:05.173]  All libertarians are against it.
[01:10:05.173 --> 01:10:08.536]  Almost every democrat I know, unless it's Hillary Clinton or Chuckie Schumer.
[01:10:08.536 --> 01:10:13.700]  All democrats are against it, unless you're talking about the Democratic Party, who run things.
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:14.601]  It's unbelievable!
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:23.410]  And I played that little seven minute interview a few days ago, I guess back on Monday, because it illustrated how these people operate.
[01:10:24.307 --> 01:10:27.650]  It illustrated... I mean, O'Reilly has no information.
[01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:35.558]  He just says, you're a minority, you're acute, you're marginalized, you're a liar, it's your opinion that torture's going on.
[01:10:35.558 --> 01:10:36.479]  It's unbelievable.
[01:10:36.479 --> 01:10:37.560]  But I don't just have her here.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.083]  I think she did the best job I've ever seen with O'Reilly.
[01:10:40.083 --> 01:10:42.405]  I don't just have her here to talk about the O'Reilly thing.
[01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:45.548]  Because that was mainly like a classroom example of their lies and propaganda.
[01:10:46.312 --> 01:10:59.148]  I have her on because I want to talk about how they shut down the Democrats, how they're trying to force the Democrats to try to end this war, which all the CIA analysts have said our troops there make it worse for everybody, including our troops.
[01:10:59.148 --> 01:11:05.275]  I want to get her take on how they got into the meeting, how they shut down the Democrats, and what she thinks and her group thinks of the
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:11.901]  The horrible speech last night of the Neocon President-in-Chief.
[01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:14.982]  And her name is Sunsara Taylor.
[01:11:14.982 --> 01:11:15.842]  Sunsara Taylor.
[01:11:15.842 --> 01:11:18.002]  And I really appreciate her coming on.
[01:11:18.002 --> 01:11:19.062]  And she's got a long bio.
[01:11:19.062 --> 01:11:21.443]  We've got a link to it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:23.423]  Sunsara, thanks for coming on.
[01:11:23.423 --> 01:11:23.803]  Hi.
[01:11:23.803 --> 01:11:24.804]  Great to be with you, Alex.
[01:11:24.804 --> 01:11:25.864]  Thanks for having me.
[01:11:25.864 --> 01:11:26.824]  You bet.
[01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:28.084]  You know, you're such a fit.
[01:11:28.084 --> 01:11:29.745]  There's only 50 in your group.
[01:11:29.745 --> 01:11:31.925]  I mean, you're just pathetic, aren't you?
[01:11:33.021 --> 01:11:37.144]  Well, that's what, obviously, you're quoting Bill O'Reilly.
[01:11:37.144 --> 01:11:43.648]  Yeah, we had... World Can't Wait, the full name is World Can't Wait, Drive Out the Bush Regime.
[01:11:43.648 --> 01:11:52.633]  And we represent the sentiments of literally millions of people in this country and millions around the world.
[01:11:52.633 --> 01:11:56.976]  But part of the thing that we're trying to speak to and deal with is the fact that people in government are
[01:11:58.251 --> 01:12:01.093]  Everybody is going along with what the Bush regime is doing.
[01:12:01.093 --> 01:12:16.220]  The Democratic Party, it's toeing the line, it makes a few petty amendments and some symbolic protests here and there, but it's always in the terms and the logic that the Bush administration has set, and it always folds at the end when it matters most.
[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:20.583]  This is how we saw the Military Commissions Act legalize torture and rip up habeas corpus.
[01:12:20.583 --> 01:12:23.484]  This is how we saw the Patriot Act 1 and 2 get passed.
[01:12:23.484 --> 01:12:26.666]  This is how we saw the Supreme Court's Roberts and Alito get
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:43.530]  We just over and over and over again, the Bush administration gets caught spying, the illegal, wantless wiretapping, the NSA spying, they get caught spying, you hear a little bit of protest from the Democrats, and then they get quote, reasonable, and then they go along.
[01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:46.872]  And over and over again, we've seen this play out, and the world can't wait.
[01:12:46.872 --> 01:12:50.494]  Our mission is to say, okay look, we are the majority, there are millions of us.
[01:12:50.494 --> 01:12:55.858]  History is not going to judge us based on what the Democratic Party did or failed to do.
[01:12:56.514 --> 01:13:11.241]  Or on whether Bush listened to us or failed to listen to us, they're going to judge us by whether or not we went along with war crimes, what objectively are war crimes and crimes against humanity being committed in the war on Iraq, and a whole fascistic remaking of U.S.
[01:13:11.241 --> 01:13:18.865]  society, and that there are enough of us that if we dare to act on our own, independent political actions,
[01:13:19.415 --> 01:13:22.138]  Out protesting the streets, being heard by the people of the world.
[01:13:22.138 --> 01:13:24.420]  If we dare to do that, we can change history.
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:30.405]  But if we're passive, then we're going to be judged very sharply, because there is a point at which it becomes too late.
[01:13:30.405 --> 01:13:42.356]  Well, I mean, you're not just using those as flowerly verbiage that fascistic society... I mean, the most popular TV show, they torture children almost every episode.
[01:13:42.356 --> 01:13:43.957]  In real life, the
[01:13:45.029 --> 01:13:50.232]  You know, one of the top lawyers in the White House writes memos saying they can crush children's body parts.
[01:13:50.232 --> 01:13:52.593]  Yeah, that's John Yoo you're talking about.
[01:13:52.593 --> 01:13:53.493]  That's very important.
[01:13:53.493 --> 01:13:55.694]  I want to actually... These people are sick!
[01:13:55.694 --> 01:13:58.096]  I mean, this isn't a game.
[01:13:58.096 --> 01:14:02.578]  Halliburton and Dyncor are in major newspapers running giant slave rings.
[01:14:02.578 --> 01:14:04.639]  I mean, you cannot make this type of stuff up, folks.
[01:14:04.639 --> 01:14:11.722]  This is so crazy that I have trouble believing it, even when it's admitted, and it just gets worse and worse and worse.
[01:14:11.722 --> 01:14:13.043]  But let's go back.
[01:14:14.029 --> 01:14:16.519]  To the Democrats, just briefly here.
[01:14:16.519 --> 01:14:18.829]  Democrats plan to fight expansion of troops.
[01:14:19.818 --> 01:14:22.559]  Well, now notice, see, that's why Bush said more troops.
[01:14:22.559 --> 01:14:31.003]  That way the Democrats get to act like they're fighting something, but they don't want to reduce troops, so he increases troops, and now they fight him on an increase.
[01:14:31.003 --> 01:14:41.687]  That is total smoke and mirrors, and now they're going to have a symbolic vote, saying they don't like how he's handled the war, but we're going to support the troops, the Democrats say, by keeping them there.
[01:14:41.687 --> 01:14:46.049]  I mean, if a child's in a house burning, you don't support the child by leaving him in the burning house.
[01:14:46.049 --> 01:14:48.230]  I mean, the Democrats were sent to Congress
[01:14:49.429 --> 01:14:52.910]  Overwhelmingly, because the people want this war to end.
[01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:54.871]  That's number one!
[01:14:54.871 --> 01:15:03.853]  And number two, because they don't like the Patriot Act, they don't like the Military Commissions Act, they don't like the Defense Authorization Act that makes Bush a dictator over the governors.
[01:15:03.853 --> 01:15:04.654]  And what do they do?
[01:15:04.654 --> 01:15:08.355]  They come in with the 9-11 Commission recommendations for an even bigger police state.
[01:15:08.355 --> 01:15:14.897]  They come in and they, uh, I mean, how mad are Democrats you're talking to?
[01:15:14.897 --> 01:15:15.497]  How mad?
[01:15:16.403 --> 01:15:19.725]  I mean, are Democrats on the ground, constituents, are they seeing through this?
[01:15:19.725 --> 01:15:20.946]  Oh, I get what you're saying.
[01:15:20.946 --> 01:15:22.126]  The little d-Democrats.
[01:15:22.126 --> 01:15:23.927]  People are fed up.
[01:15:23.927 --> 01:15:27.409]  I think people are really fed up, but here's the challenge.
[01:15:27.409 --> 01:15:34.933]  I think that, you know, in a situation as dire as this is, there are two things operating with people, I'm saying now.
[01:15:34.933 --> 01:15:42.878]  Broadly, millions of people, there is a desire to deny how bad it is, and the mass media will help them with that every day, you know?
[01:15:43.894 --> 01:15:47.056]  And there's a question of whether or not they can really affect things.
[01:15:47.056 --> 01:15:49.558]  And the two interpenetrate because they do see.
[01:15:49.558 --> 01:15:52.560]  They say, oh, we voted and it hasn't made any difference.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:56.503]  And they watch this war now escalate in the face of that.
[01:15:56.503 --> 01:16:05.810]  And I think the challenge is to really speak to those people, people in your audience, and them going out and speaking to others and saying, look, this is on us.
[01:16:06.622 --> 01:16:07.542]  No more waiting.
[01:16:07.542 --> 01:16:09.963]  And this is what WorldCan'tWait.org is about.
[01:16:09.963 --> 01:16:10.763]  People are going there.
[01:16:10.763 --> 01:16:13.784]  We're going to be out in the streets all across the country today protesting this.
[01:16:13.784 --> 01:16:16.824]  You get tens of millions of visitors.
[01:16:16.824 --> 01:16:17.765]  Not tens of millions.
[01:16:17.765 --> 01:16:19.465]  We need tens of millions of visitors.
[01:16:19.465 --> 01:16:22.486]  We get... I don't know how many visitors we get actually.
[01:16:22.486 --> 01:16:24.046]  I don't think you've looked into that.
[01:16:24.046 --> 01:16:25.367]  I've seen the ratings of the site.
[01:16:25.367 --> 01:16:26.527]  It's quite high.
[01:16:26.527 --> 01:16:28.067]  And it's duplicated all over the web.
[01:16:28.067 --> 01:16:31.148]  I constantly get WorldCan'tWait bulletins every five minutes.
[01:16:31.934 --> 01:16:34.196]  Oh, that's great, but people should go out in the streets today.
[01:16:34.196 --> 01:16:50.630]  There are protests at military recruiting installations all over the country, in cities all over the country, and if there's not one where you are... Oh yeah, our listeners tell us that then recruiters come out and threaten them and try to start fights with them, but they put video cameras on the cockroaches and they scurry away.
[01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:56.896]  Yeah, but I think here's a... One of the things in the Iraq Study Group, and you're right about the smoke and mirrors about the Democrats,
[01:16:57.731 --> 01:17:02.636]  We're in a situation where the only just solution is an immediate withdrawal.
[01:17:02.636 --> 01:17:04.357]  This war was based on lies.
[01:17:04.357 --> 01:17:07.761]  It's an unjust, immoral, illegitimate war.
[01:17:07.761 --> 01:17:09.642]  They meant to get us into a quagmire.
[01:17:09.642 --> 01:17:10.443]  That's the excuse.
[01:17:10.443 --> 01:17:14.327]  That's why they want a civil war, as an excuse to stay and build the bases.
[01:17:14.327 --> 01:17:18.811]  Well, they're going to be there, and now they're positioning for a war against Iran for an escalation.
[01:17:23.334 --> 01:17:25.234]  The whole premise of this is rotten.
[01:17:25.234 --> 01:17:31.776]  The whole premise of a war on terror, which, you know, was planned long before 9-11, and... And they lie!
[01:17:31.776 --> 01:17:44.739]  They lie to the conservatives in this country and tell them, oh, we were in there to turn the lights on and get Saddam out, when the whole time they were going to build permanent bases and use it to attack Iran in their own policy reports, and these neoconalists are still by the lie!
[01:17:44.739 --> 01:17:47.279]  I don't know why they're so stupid!
[01:17:47.279 --> 01:17:51.660]  Well, you're right about that, and this is a logic that you cannot
[01:17:52.313 --> 01:17:53.154]  I don't know.
[01:18:06.991 --> 01:18:13.634]  One of the things the world can't wait has a call that launched this movement and it walks through the crimes of this administration and confronts people with it.
[01:18:13.634 --> 01:18:21.398]  It says your government on the basis of outrageous lies is waging an utterly illegitimate and murderous war in Iraq with other countries in its sights.
[01:18:21.398 --> 01:18:23.119]  And then it goes on, your government is torturing,
[01:18:23.319 --> 01:18:23.579]  I think?
[01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:49.436]  The elections, and believe they're on a mission from God, will not go without a fight, and there's not going to be a savior from the Democratic Party.
[01:18:49.436 --> 01:18:54.882]  But Sansara, you've got to know that Bush uses that to manipulate Christians.
[01:18:54.882 --> 01:18:57.145]  I mean, it's a total joke.
[01:18:57.145 --> 01:19:01.870]  There's constant gay prostitutes in the White House, bohemian groves, skull and bones, it's a big...
[01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:04.071]  I think if you look back at the Nixon experience, that
[01:19:27.381 --> 01:19:33.066]  Everybody, I mean, any honest assessment of history says that that is not just about a Watergate break-in.
[01:19:33.066 --> 01:19:35.668]  That was about a whole situation in society.
[01:19:35.668 --> 01:19:43.195]  And I think, um, you look back at what was happening there, it was the U.S., their army was being defeated and disintegrating in Vietnam.
[01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:44.956]  The troops were in political rebellion.
[01:19:44.956 --> 01:19:48.619]  People were, you know, fed up with the war and consciously opposing it.
[01:19:48.619 --> 01:19:51.922]  There was, you know, when Nixon said he was going to escalate, he was going to
[01:19:52.336 --> 01:19:56.257]  End the war in Vietnam by escalating into Cambodia?
[01:19:56.257 --> 01:19:59.638]  You saw the hugest student protests and strikes in the history of this country.
[01:19:59.638 --> 01:20:00.878]  Campuses shut down.
[01:20:00.878 --> 01:20:04.199]  People turned out in the tens of thousands in the streets.
[01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:17.103]  And without that, then, you know, it's a combination of international problems that they run into, fighting within the ranks of the Democrats and the Republicans and even within the Bush camp, but then people acting in that mix.
[01:20:17.103 --> 01:20:20.944]  If the people do not act, then they will muddle through and it will be horrific.
[01:20:21.921 --> 01:20:27.609]  And right now, they seem to be having trouble, but they will consolidate again if people do not get out there and make a lot of trouble.
[01:20:27.609 --> 01:20:27.909]  Stay there.
[01:20:27.909 --> 01:20:32.195]  Let's talk about how they're having trouble and how we drive a wedge in there with Sincera Taylor.
[01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:38.013]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:20:38.013 --> 01:20:45.478]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:20:45.478 --> 01:20:56.305]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:20:56.305 --> 01:21:00.828]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:21:01.128 --> 01:21:06.333]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:21:06.333 --> 01:21:09.495]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:21:09.495 --> 01:21:19.404]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:21:24.667 --> 01:21:28.048]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[01:21:28.048 --> 01:21:28.608]  Supreme Court.
[01:21:28.608 --> 01:21:30.289]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S.
[01:21:30.289 --> 01:21:33.569]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[01:21:52.592 --> 01:21:58.637]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[01:21:58.637 --> 01:22:08.506]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:32.509 --> 01:22:33.549]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[01:22:33.549 --> 01:22:33.949]  January 11, 2007.
[01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:34.149]  Gold 61180.
[01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:35.650]  Ounce gold coins 33220, 31865 for half, 15932 for quarter ounce.
[01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:35.850]  That's 63220, 31865, 15932. 1971.
[01:22:47.432 --> 01:22:48.792]  Nixon closes the gold window.
[01:22:48.792 --> 01:22:50.533]  Fiat currency, 1920s.
[01:22:50.533 --> 01:22:54.754]  The German mark explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[01:22:54.754 --> 01:22:57.795]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[01:22:57.795 --> 01:23:00.716]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[01:23:00.716 --> 01:23:04.297]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[01:23:04.297 --> 01:23:07.318]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[01:23:07.318 --> 01:23:13.060]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.520]  Could government let this happen?
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.521]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[01:23:16.821 --> 01:23:24.086]  Midas has Nick Bereshov's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[01:23:24.086 --> 01:23:25.947]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[01:23:25.947 --> 01:23:27.308]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[01:23:27.308 --> 01:23:27.488]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:32.911 --> 01:23:33.692]  It's a fact.
[01:23:33.692 --> 01:23:38.577]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:23:38.577 --> 01:23:44.063]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:23:44.063 --> 01:23:47.527]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[01:23:47.527 --> 01:23:54.635]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:23:54.995 --> 01:24:02.619]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:24:02.619 --> 01:24:04.920]  We also do credit restoration.
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:13.304]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt instead of living each day in fear.
[01:24:13.684 --> 01:24:15.585]  It's time to turn your life around.
[01:24:15.585 --> 01:24:18.207]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.

[01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:22.050]  That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert.
[01:24:22.050 --> 01:24:25.092]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:24:42.214 --> 01:24:43.275]  Welcome back!
[01:25:07.627 --> 01:25:18.331]  So Sara Taylor, one of the spokespeople for WorldCampWeight.org, who really did the best job I've ever seen with O'Reilly, just stating the facts.
[01:25:18.331 --> 01:25:21.132]  But you know, O'Reilly is talking to a mindless population.
[01:25:21.132 --> 01:25:26.974]  People that watch Fox News, by and large, either watch it for entertainment, and I have before, just rolling around laughing.
[01:25:26.974 --> 01:25:28.335]  I mean, it's literally like a cartoon.
[01:25:29.312 --> 01:25:31.856]  You know, you're crazy, you're a kook, you're a minority.
[01:25:31.856 --> 01:25:34.239]  The majority of the people want the war.
[01:25:34.239 --> 01:25:38.865]  And of course, it's all total lies!
[01:25:38.865 --> 01:25:40.007]  He certainly seemed frustrated.
[01:25:40.007 --> 01:25:42.070]  I want to talk a little bit about that, but getting back...
[01:25:42.868 --> 01:25:48.690]  You think they're floundering right now, and it does seem like that because now they know the Democrats didn't get a honeymoon.
[01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:57.292]  It totally freaked them out whenever you guys shut them down day one when they were trying to, you know, go quietly into the night with Bush.
[01:25:57.292 --> 01:26:01.633]  And the American people, as you said, are now seeing through the fraud.
[01:26:01.633 --> 01:26:07.155]  Both political parties are unpopular right now in major polls because they're seen as the establishment parties.
[01:26:07.155 --> 01:26:08.875]  Samsara, where is this going?
[01:26:08.875 --> 01:26:11.956]  How do we accentuate the wake-up that's happening?
[01:26:12.782 --> 01:26:23.530]  Well, I think the most critical thing and the reason we were in Congress's face on their first day was not so much to let Congress know, oh, we want an end to the war.
[01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:24.951]  Everybody, they know that.
[01:26:24.951 --> 01:26:29.815]  But to really send a signal to the people in this country that you need to be in the streets.
[01:26:29.815 --> 01:26:30.996]  This is the place to be.
[01:26:30.996 --> 01:26:34.098]  History is being shaped by what we do or fail to do right now.
[01:26:34.819 --> 01:26:46.928]  And we wanted people around the country and people around the world to see that there are people stepping out into the streets, raising our voices, protesting, and to signal to others that if you want to be heard, this is where you have to be.
[01:26:46.928 --> 01:26:50.911]  If you want to be heard, not by Pelosi.
[01:26:50.911 --> 01:26:55.234]  Oh, I realize now there's people who don't like this horse.
[01:26:55.234 --> 01:26:56.335]  She knows that.
[01:26:56.335 --> 01:27:03.620]  But to actually raise such upheaval, political upheaval, from below in this society where, like I was saying before with Nixon, where
[01:27:05.126 --> 01:27:31.000]  When Nixon was impeached, it wasn't because the Democrats listened to the people, or because whatever, but they got into such trouble in the war with public opinion, with the population in danger of losing faith and losing their allegiance to the whole way that the system works, that you had people in Nixon's own cabinet, Republicans, refusing to lie for him.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.642]  He ordered the special prosecutor of Watergate to be fired.
[01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:37.773]  And two people of his subordinates refused to carry that out.
[01:27:37.773 --> 01:27:46.481]  You had a situation where people said, I'm not associating with this anymore, and if we don't get rid of him and the policies that he's pushing, things are going to come undone.
[01:27:46.481 --> 01:27:50.004]  But there were people out in the streets in political upheaval.
[01:27:50.004 --> 01:27:51.045]  That's the difference.
[01:27:51.045 --> 01:27:57.070]  Sure, the mafia around Bush, though, is much more cold-blooded and much more consolidated than Nixon.
[01:27:57.070 --> 01:27:58.972]  Nixon is literally a choir boy.
[01:27:59.593 --> 01:28:02.318]  Uh, you know, childlike in his corruption.
[01:28:02.318 --> 01:28:07.988]  You know, this is like stealing out of a cookie jar, uh, compared to the things that Bush has been doing.
[01:28:07.988 --> 01:28:11.936]  But I'm saying, if you had, if you, what's missing now is people acting
[01:28:12.475 --> 01:28:16.018]  Really in a cohesive, determined, relentless political struggle.
[01:28:16.018 --> 01:28:16.598]  Oh, I agree.
[01:28:16.598 --> 01:28:25.866]  Everywhere a Democrat... And if you had that, then you'd have, you know, then Pelosi, I think, would be forced to change her tune, not because she was persuaded, but because she was compelled.
[01:28:25.866 --> 01:28:27.407]  And I think that's... Well, what do you do then?
[01:28:27.407 --> 01:28:27.847]  What do you do?
[01:28:27.847 --> 01:28:30.409]  Tell the Democrats that we don't care.
[01:28:30.409 --> 01:28:35.273]  If you don't vote out this war, we will put money behind candidates against you.
[01:28:35.273 --> 01:28:36.194]  We will remove you?
[01:28:37.088 --> 01:28:40.631]  No, I'm not talking about 08 and voting them out.
[01:28:40.631 --> 01:28:42.813]  I don't think we have that much time, to be honest.
[01:28:42.813 --> 01:28:48.579]  Yeah, they'll launch a war with Iran and start the mass arrest in FEMA camps, you know.
[01:28:48.579 --> 01:28:58.848]  Well, I do think if people are out in the streets, it makes it much more difficult for them to project the strength they want to around the world, and it makes it much harder for them to have
[01:28:59.672 --> 01:29:04.036]  Troop morale wanting to fight a losing, senseless war?
[01:29:04.036 --> 01:29:05.518]  There's another fraud.
[01:29:05.518 --> 01:29:08.961]  Major polls show 70 plus percent of the troops want to come home.
[01:29:08.961 --> 01:29:10.503]  I talked to people at bases.
[01:29:10.503 --> 01:29:11.884]  Almost all of them hate it.
[01:29:11.884 --> 01:29:17.349]  There's a few brainwashed people who think they're really fighting Al-Qaeda over there.
[01:29:17.349 --> 01:29:20.932]  So, I mean, it seems like... Look, the people are awake.
[01:29:20.932 --> 01:29:23.295]  Folks don't want the war, but the war just goes on.
[01:29:23.917 --> 01:29:25.578]  But it doesn't have to keep going on.
[01:29:25.578 --> 01:29:27.578]  People are awake, but people need to be in motion.
[01:29:27.578 --> 01:29:35.880]  And I want to make the distinction between those things, because the people in Iraq do not see all the bumper stickers that are against the war.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:43.723]  They don't hear people cursing out their television set when George Bush comes on and gives the kind of, you know, horrific speech he gave last night.
[01:29:43.723 --> 01:29:45.743]  People in Guantanamo don't hear that.
[01:29:45.743 --> 01:29:48.804]  But we actually have to not just have public opinion.
[01:29:48.804 --> 01:29:51.245]  I mean, we don't look back at Nazi Germany and say, wow, you know,
[01:29:52.398 --> 01:29:55.559]  Sure, it's a good thing that a lot of German people didn't like Hitler.
[01:29:55.559 --> 01:30:01.620]  No, we look back at it and say, you know, they didn't actually act soon enough, act massively enough, and they let it happen.
[01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:02.580]  Okay, we got a break again.
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:06.081]  We'll talk a few minutes on the other side, then I'll go to your phone calls, folks, at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:30:06.081 --> 01:30:12.422]  Tons of world news, more on Somalia, more on the Iran buildup.
[01:30:12.422 --> 01:30:15.563]  But we'll get solutions from our guest from World Can't Wait.
[01:30:15.563 --> 01:30:18.583]  On the other side, she's Samsara Taylor.
[01:30:18.583 --> 01:30:20.904]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:30:23.391 --> 01:30:27.294]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:30:27.294 --> 01:30:33.079]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:33.079 --> 01:30:36.161]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?

[01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:35.069]  Do it today!
[01:31:35.069 --> 01:31:36.049]  Pinch me, Bill.
[01:31:36.049 --> 01:31:37.430]  I can't believe it.
[01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:40.632]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car.
[01:31:40.632 --> 01:31:43.094]  And here we are with season tickets on the 50-yard line.
[01:31:44.315 --> 01:31:45.356]  I know what you mean, John.
[01:31:45.356 --> 01:31:50.080]  I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:53.963]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:53.963 --> 01:31:56.005]  I was struggling to make ends meet.
[01:31:56.005 --> 01:32:01.210]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.
[01:32:01.210 --> 01:32:02.271]  And I owe it all to you.
[01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:06.232]  Because you told me about DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:32:06.232 --> 01:32:09.313]  Hey John, we all win when the money problems disappear.
[01:32:09.313 --> 01:32:10.833]  I want to tell everybody.
[01:32:10.833 --> 01:32:14.574]  Because the more people we have on the success team, the better it works.
[01:32:14.574 --> 01:32:16.514]  It's hard for the little guy these days.
[01:32:16.514 --> 01:32:19.295]  We pool our resources to level the playing field.
[01:32:19.295 --> 01:32:25.777]  So the more people that go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com, the more cash for everybody.
[01:32:25.777 --> 01:32:26.597]  What a concept!
[01:32:32.839 --> 01:32:37.322]  Have you ever wondered about what the Mark of the Beast is in Chapter 13 of Revelation?
[01:32:37.322 --> 01:32:39.803]  What does 666 really mean?
[01:32:39.803 --> 01:32:42.525]  Or about the harlot church of Revelation 17?
[01:32:42.525 --> 01:32:44.606]  Or about the Beast of Daniel in Revelation?
[01:32:44.606 --> 01:32:48.568]  Speculation abounds about these ancient prophecies and what they might mean today.
[01:32:48.568 --> 01:32:56.873]  Now, one of the foremost scholars on geopolitics and popular talk show guest, Dr. Michael Kaufman, has just released a DVD called, World Events and Prophecy.
[01:32:57.393 --> 01:33:09.276]  Dr. Michael Kaufman is recognized for his penetrating analyses of global events and has used his information to almost single-handedly stop the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity from being ratified by the U.S.
[01:33:09.276 --> 01:33:12.877]  Senate one hour before the Senate was to vote to ratify it.
[01:33:12.877 --> 01:33:18.458]  Order World Events and Prophecy now and see why those who have seen it say it is one of the best DVDs on the subject.
[01:33:18.938 --> 01:33:22.780]  Order now at discerningtoday.org or call toll free 877-271-7639.
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.140]  That's 877-271-7639.
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:24.001]  Don't be caught off guard.
[01:33:40.177 --> 01:33:41.498]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:41.498 --> 01:33:42.979]  We're here Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[01:33:42.979 --> 01:33:44.519]  until 2 p.m.
[01:33:44.519 --> 01:33:47.041]  back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:33:47.041 --> 01:34:04.871]  You can subscribe for free at InfoWars.com just by clicking on subscribe for your iTunes or other system and get the full three-hour show daily delivered free to your iPod or mp3 player or you can just listen to the streams live when we're on the air number one on ShotKast
[01:34:05.941 --> 01:34:09.004]  Or you can simply listen to the show re-aired every three hours.
[01:34:09.004 --> 01:34:10.284]  It's just 24 hours a day.
[01:34:10.284 --> 01:34:14.688]  We stream it out at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:14.688 --> 01:34:18.210]  And it's up to you to continue to grow the show and reach the American people.
[01:34:18.210 --> 01:34:19.211]  It's not about left and right.
[01:34:19.211 --> 01:34:20.312]  It's about right and wrong.
[01:34:20.312 --> 01:34:21.613]  The cliche is true.
[01:34:21.613 --> 01:34:23.634]  We want constitutional republic.
[01:34:23.634 --> 01:34:24.575]  We want dignity.
[01:34:24.575 --> 01:34:25.255]  We want honor.
[01:34:25.255 --> 01:34:26.416]  We don't want corruption.
[01:34:26.416 --> 01:34:29.738]  We don't want to be warmongers for global corporate elites.
[01:34:29.738 --> 01:34:32.780]  We want to keep our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:33.361]  And I tell you,
[01:34:34.806 --> 01:34:37.147]  Sunsara Taylor did a great job with Bill O'Reilly.
[01:34:37.147 --> 01:34:38.507]  We don't have time to play it today.
[01:34:38.507 --> 01:34:40.548]  We played it a few days ago.
[01:34:40.548 --> 01:34:41.749]  He's so despicable.
[01:34:41.749 --> 01:34:43.729]  But it's the mindlessness.
[01:34:43.729 --> 01:34:49.251]  It was like a third grade argument, but only on his side.
[01:34:49.251 --> 01:34:50.251]  Just spewing lies.
[01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:50.952]  And he knows that.
[01:34:50.952 --> 01:34:53.973]  He's talking down to you like you're stupid.
[01:34:53.973 --> 01:34:59.855]  And even if you're for this war and you like to warmonger, you've got to know you've been lied to every step of the way premeditatedly.
[01:34:59.855 --> 01:35:00.975]  Lying isn't good.
[01:35:01.881 --> 01:35:04.344]  And we're going to go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:35:04.344 --> 01:35:09.588]  I just hope that everybody will get involved when you hear about anti-war rallies.
[01:35:09.588 --> 01:35:16.495]  I hope, but more importantly, that you'll go when your congressman or woman is going to be speaking in your district and you go, hey, we want this war over!
[01:35:16.495 --> 01:35:18.076]  The majority of us want it over.
[01:35:18.076 --> 01:35:19.237]  They lied to get us into it.
[01:35:19.237 --> 01:35:20.499]  They're escalating it.
[01:35:20.499 --> 01:35:20.719]  End it!
[01:35:21.497 --> 01:35:24.799]  And you need to get aggressive about this.
[01:35:24.799 --> 01:35:31.903]  You need to find out what corporations are donating to these people and let them know you're going to boycott them if they support war.
[01:35:31.903 --> 01:35:34.165]  What are other ideas we can do?
[01:35:34.165 --> 01:35:36.906]  So, Sara Taylor.
[01:35:36.906 --> 01:35:39.128]  I think that the ones that you named are very important.
[01:35:39.128 --> 01:35:41.549]  Go out to the protests.
[01:35:41.549 --> 01:35:44.991]  There are protests all across the country today against the troop surge.
[01:35:44.991 --> 01:35:47.633]  Also on January 27th in Washington, D.C.
[01:35:47.633 --> 01:35:49.194]  Very important protest against the war.
[01:35:49.730 --> 01:35:58.961]  Also, if you go to worldcantwait.org, there are chapters of World Can't Wait in dozens of cities all across the country, or you can start your own.
[01:35:58.961 --> 01:36:03.586]  And there's the call that I was referencing before, the call to drive out the Bush regime.
[01:36:03.586 --> 01:36:08.472]  We're launching a movement to distribute, hand-to-hand, a million copies of these, because
[01:36:08.968 --> 01:36:10.469]  Like you're saying, O'Reilly does lie.
[01:36:10.469 --> 01:36:12.711]  The major media does lie.
[01:36:12.711 --> 01:36:21.016]  And this is going to be, from the ground up, an effort to reach people with the truth and reach people with a mechanism and an organization and a vehicle for us to act together.
[01:36:21.016 --> 01:36:21.617]  But here's the deal.
[01:36:21.617 --> 01:36:30.843]  How dumb does he think people are saying it is a minority view of the American people that are against the war?
[01:36:30.843 --> 01:36:32.865]  Everyone knows that's a lie.
[01:36:32.865 --> 01:36:35.266]  Well, it was a conspicuous lie, what O'Reilly said.
[01:36:35.266 --> 01:36:37.308]  But here's the thing about O'Reilly I wanted to also note.
[01:36:38.132 --> 01:36:43.280]  Anytime that you cite a fact, and this happened when I was on his show, he says, oh, well, that's your opinion.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.922]  And he's training people how to think.
[01:36:44.922 --> 01:36:50.631]  He's not just lying to them and helping promote a reactionary criminal war of aggression.
[01:36:51.595 --> 01:36:55.918]  He's also training people that opinion and fact are interchangeable.
[01:36:55.918 --> 01:36:58.620]  If you don't like the fact... It's a double thing!
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:02.202]  You can dismiss it because you can say, oh those are your facts.
[01:37:02.202 --> 01:37:03.242]  Exactly!
[01:37:03.242 --> 01:37:05.043]  Exactly!
[01:37:05.043 --> 01:37:08.626]  Reality exists and if something is true, it's true for you, it's true for me.
[01:37:08.626 --> 01:37:12.448]  We may not like it, we may come to different conclusions about it.
[01:37:12.901 --> 01:37:14.883]  But this is actually a really dangerous thing.
[01:37:14.883 --> 01:37:18.365]  This is how you get a whole section of people to go along with George Bush's life.
[01:37:18.365 --> 01:37:19.246]  No, they're being brainwashed!
[01:37:19.246 --> 01:37:20.347]  They're being brainwashed!
[01:37:20.347 --> 01:37:22.768]  Yeah, you get trained not to distinguish.
[01:37:22.768 --> 01:37:32.556]  And literally, there's millions of people who are being trained not to be able to distinguish between fact and political opinion and the opinion of George Bush.
[01:37:32.556 --> 01:37:34.037]  Well, I'll tell you, that's a key point you made.
[01:37:34.037 --> 01:37:35.358]  Let me elaborate on that briefly.
[01:37:36.417 --> 01:37:38.079]  That is exactly what I've witnessed.
[01:37:38.079 --> 01:37:41.042]  Listen, in Somalia, they strike Somalia.
[01:37:41.042 --> 01:37:44.625]  It turns out no Al-Qaeda killed, no Al-Qaeda there.
[01:37:44.625 --> 01:37:48.869]  They were upset because a stable government had formed and kicked out the warlords.
[01:37:48.869 --> 01:37:59.579]  So our government goes in and meets in the last few months with the warlords, goes into Ethiopia, has a U.S.-backed attempted coup, working with the warlords that killed our troops in 1993.
[01:37:59.579 --> 01:38:01.441]  By the way, folks, this is admitted!
[01:38:01.981 --> 01:38:08.467]  This is admitted, but by the time it hits talk radio, they're going, George Bush is striking them back for Somalia.
[01:38:08.467 --> 01:38:12.271]  No, George Bush hired the very people that did that.
[01:38:12.271 --> 01:38:14.493]  I mean, how dumb are these people?
[01:38:14.493 --> 01:38:17.416]  What is wrong with neocon radio listeners?
[01:38:17.416 --> 01:38:21.720]  They are the scum of the earth, and I'm mad about this.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:22.600]  I'm sorry, you want to comment?
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:23.181]  You are mad.
[01:38:23.181 --> 01:38:23.801]  You are mad.
[01:38:23.801 --> 01:38:24.782]  I don't blame you.
[01:38:24.782 --> 01:38:25.343]  I don't blame you.
[01:38:26.403 --> 01:38:29.384]  There's no end to the abominations!
[01:38:29.384 --> 01:38:31.705]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are?
[01:38:31.705 --> 01:38:49.292]  By the time it hits Rush Limbaugh, we're teaching Somalia a lesson, and in truth, they don't want them to have a stable government so the oil companies can control it, so we're hiring the people that shot down our helicopters and drug our troops to the streets, but by the time the idiot listener hears it, who just wants to feel good... I mean, these guys feel manly.
[01:38:49.292 --> 01:38:50.833]  Son Sara, I hope you know that.
[01:38:50.833 --> 01:38:53.514]  This is their manhood, is watching TV.
[01:38:53.514 --> 01:38:54.194]  They love it!
[01:38:56.079 --> 01:39:01.709]  This is again where I would call on people to go and print out the call for the World Can't Wait to hand it out to other people.
[01:39:01.709 --> 01:39:05.656]  This is something that from the bottom up, the information that you cannot get anywhere else.
[01:39:06.466 --> 01:39:12.470]  Um, that you can get on our website that some of the stuff that you're talking about, by the way, we should never have done the invasion of Somalia.
[01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:14.071]  I mean, these are things, the U.S.
[01:39:14.071 --> 01:39:16.873]  feels that it has the right to go into any country at any time.
[01:39:16.873 --> 01:39:19.694]  Now they've codified it with their new doctrine of preemptive war.
[01:39:19.694 --> 01:39:21.355]  Well, I agree, that was a U.N.
[01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:22.016]  That was a U.N.
[01:39:22.016 --> 01:39:30.181]  disaster, but I mean, aside from that, the point is, they're on air saying we're fighting the guys that killed our people when in truth, our dirty government went and hired them.
[01:39:30.661 --> 01:39:32.562]  And here's another thing that people should know.
[01:39:32.562 --> 01:39:46.510]  Boykin, General Jerry Boykin, who is one of the leading commanders of the Mogadishu battle, he is one of these people who said, and I'll quote him, he said he won that because, quote, my God is bigger than their God.
[01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:54.355]  And then he stood in a megachurch out in Colorado and preached that George Bush was put in the White House by God.
[01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:59.118]  And I quote him, he said... And wasn't that the same church where, I've seen the photos, with the gay preacher?
[01:39:59.835 --> 01:40:00.676]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:00.676 --> 01:40:01.738]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[01:40:01.738 --> 01:40:02.779]  It's a big joke.
[01:40:16.064 --> 01:40:21.426]  And whether it be George Bush's truth, or some human being's interpretation... No, no, they are a cult!
[01:40:21.426 --> 01:40:30.470]  Listen, they've taken the CIA brainwashing and merged it with paid-off Christian churches, mega-churches, who are in the employ of Israel, and yeah, no, it's a giant cult!
[01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:32.010]  No, I agree, they're cult members!
[01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:34.231]  I just don't blame Christians for these people.
[01:40:34.231 --> 01:40:45.516]  Well, I don't blame all Christians for them, and I don't think that all Christians ascribe to this, but I do think that there's a method to it, that, you know, that the truth exists in reality, it does not come from
[01:40:46.115 --> 01:40:49.676]  Any human authority's mouth, including the human authorities that wrote the Bible.
[01:40:49.676 --> 01:41:01.619]  And that's something, I mean, we may differ on that, you and I. Well, I'm a Christian, I believe in God, and I want people to know George Bush is no Christian, just like the, you know, bathhouse preacher hanging out with the general saying Bush is God.
[01:41:01.619 --> 01:41:04.660]  I mean, who knows where they went after the meeting?
[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:10.782]  I stood in a stadium event of young people called Battle Cry.
[01:41:10.782 --> 01:41:11.642]  It was about 16,000 youth with
[01:41:14.642 --> 01:41:18.765]  Franklin Graham came and preached a holy war about Iraq.
[01:41:18.765 --> 01:41:21.547]  George Bush sent a blessing to this event.
[01:41:21.547 --> 01:41:24.369]  And they all go shine up for the war after that.
[01:41:24.369 --> 01:41:29.932]  Navy SEALs come in and preach to 13-12 year olds about joining God's army.
[01:41:29.932 --> 01:41:33.835]  They're gun-toting Navy SEALs, very macho like you're saying.
[01:41:34.435 --> 01:41:46.307]  And this is actually being, these battle cry events, they go around the country, they have the name of George Bush, but they are raising people who are trained not to think, and trained to obey, and trained to fight for this.
[01:41:46.307 --> 01:41:48.449]  And I think this is very dangerous.
[01:41:48.449 --> 01:41:55.776]  But this is again, well, we need to go out and challenge people to think, and really engage them with substance and facts, and counter them about
[01:41:56.098 --> 01:41:58.040]  No, this war is not what you thought it was about.
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:41:59.161]  There were no WMDs.
[01:41:59.161 --> 01:42:00.682]  There were no links to Al Qaeda.
[01:42:00.682 --> 01:42:02.544]  It was never about Saddam.
[01:42:02.544 --> 01:42:04.485]  They only say that now in the after effect.
[01:42:04.485 --> 01:42:08.268]  You have pictures of Donald Rumsfeld shaking hands with Saddam in 83.
[01:42:08.268 --> 01:42:11.171]  These people were, you know, they worked together for a time, you know.
[01:42:11.171 --> 01:42:13.553]  So these things, they need to be told.
[01:42:13.553 --> 01:42:21.580]  And that when people actually have to be confronted relentlessly over and over and over again by facts and substance that counter what they're being trained to think.
[01:42:22.139 --> 01:42:24.261]  And then people need to be out in the streets acting on that.
[01:42:24.261 --> 01:42:32.089]  Sunsara Taylor, I totally agree with you, but let me elaborate on that and then we're going to let you go with a plug for the website.
[01:42:32.089 --> 01:42:38.876]  I was out riding around with a friend a few months ago and he goes, yeah, you know, they've admitted they haven't found weapons of mass destruction.
[01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:43.171]  It was actually Charlie Sheen.
[01:42:43.171 --> 01:42:51.078]  And I'm out riding around with Charlie Sheen, and I'm going, no, Charlie, the neocons still believe that they found WMDs.
[01:42:51.078 --> 01:42:52.459]  They tell their listeners that.
[01:42:52.459 --> 01:42:59.065]  But then Charlie goes, yeah, but wait a minute, Bush admits they never had them.
[01:42:59.065 --> 01:43:04.850]  And we have the White House memo saying that he planted it, he made it up.
[01:43:04.850 --> 01:43:06.572]  And I go, turn the radio on.
[01:43:07.472 --> 01:43:11.976]  And he turned it on to talk radio, and they were talking about something, and I said, flip the channel.
[01:43:11.976 --> 01:43:19.642]  And it flipped, and there they were on the radio saying they found the WMDs.
[01:43:19.642 --> 01:43:31.652]  And again, they say it so much, that I could say randomly, turn your radio on, and the second channel, but that shows how they're cult members.
[01:43:33.107 --> 01:43:41.429]  And they were saying the mobile weapons trucks were the anthrax trucks when they had the serial numbers British made the minute they found them.
[01:43:41.429 --> 01:43:45.631]  They knew they were for pumping up hydrogen balloons for surveillance because the U.S.
[01:43:45.631 --> 01:43:47.071]  has the very same trucks.
[01:43:47.071 --> 01:43:48.191]  They knew!
[01:43:48.191 --> 01:43:52.512]  But they're still saying those were anthrax trucks!
[01:43:52.512 --> 01:43:52.993]  Yeah.
[01:43:52.993 --> 01:43:57.314]  They are without shame and without any regard for the truth and they will do that.
[01:43:57.314 --> 01:43:57.974]  And this is, again,
[01:43:58.447 --> 01:43:59.467]  People need to be out there.
[01:43:59.467 --> 01:44:01.428]  This is not going to go away.
[01:44:01.428 --> 01:44:10.892]  It's only going to get worse if people do not take action, political action from below, independent of the major parties and independent of the political official process.
[01:44:10.892 --> 01:44:12.873]  But actually saying, look, we are the majority.
[01:44:12.873 --> 01:44:19.515]  I know we need to get going, but I'll tell you, we have one of the members of World Can't Wait.
[01:44:19.515 --> 01:44:22.817]  His son was killed in Afghanistan in the war there.
[01:44:22.817 --> 01:44:24.177]  And he's from Argentina.
[01:44:24.177 --> 01:44:28.219]  And he said that when we first started this movement, World Can't Wait, drive out the Bush regime.
[01:44:28.601 --> 01:44:33.628]  People said, OK, I don't like Bush, I get this, but what do you mean drive out a regime?
[01:44:33.628 --> 01:44:34.469]  How do you do that?
[01:44:34.469 --> 01:44:36.952]  And there was a lot of pondering this all over the country.
[01:44:36.952 --> 01:44:37.873]  People encountered us.
[01:44:37.873 --> 01:44:40.577]  They liked the idea, but they wanted to know, what do you mean by that?
[01:44:40.577 --> 01:44:43.440]  And finally, he said, look, it's not that complicated.
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:44.982]  In my country, we do it all the time.
[01:44:44.982 --> 01:44:46.785]  A fascist regime comes to power.
[01:44:47.461 --> 01:44:51.382]  People go out in the streets and you don't go home until the regime is driven out.
[01:44:51.382 --> 01:44:54.183]  And I think that this is really what time it is right now.
[01:44:54.183 --> 01:44:55.423]  And the clock is ticking.
[01:44:55.423 --> 01:44:57.564]  The war is being escalated.
[01:44:57.564 --> 01:44:58.644]  Iran is in their sights.
[01:44:58.644 --> 01:44:59.404]  They go after Iran.
[01:44:59.404 --> 01:45:05.326]  You're going to inflame a whole different dynamic in the globe and in that region, even worse than there is right now.
[01:45:05.326 --> 01:45:06.546]  And you're going to have all the...
[01:45:08.894 --> 01:45:14.699]  Police state repression that goes along with that kind of escalation, suppressing dissent and the protests that will grow.
[01:45:14.699 --> 01:45:19.343]  So we need to get ahead of that.
[01:45:19.343 --> 01:45:23.567]  Every day they're saying I and others like me need to be arrested.
[01:45:23.567 --> 01:45:27.010]  This is why right now, before it gets any later,
[01:45:27.370 --> 01:45:33.454]  Before it gets any later, because there is still time, but there is not a lot of time, and this is why there needs to be a political resistance.
[01:45:33.454 --> 01:45:35.415]  Go to worldcantwait.org.
[01:45:35.415 --> 01:45:37.776]  We are all stripes of the political spectrum.
[01:45:37.776 --> 01:45:45.401]  We don't agree on everything, but we do agree that no future that any of us would like to live in is going to be possible with this regime.
[01:45:45.401 --> 01:45:48.623]  I hear you, and Sunsara, I want to thank you for joining us.
[01:45:48.623 --> 01:45:53.386]  In closing, I would just add this to you and the listeners, and obviously you know this,
[01:45:54.216 --> 01:45:56.697]  But that's what Bush and the Cruz say they want.
[01:45:56.697 --> 01:46:06.682]  They want to get us into a huge war that we're fighting for our survival in, and they know that Americans will then buck up and say, all right, we've got to win it, and it'll be full scale.
[01:46:06.682 --> 01:46:09.463]  I mean, Iraq is just luring us in.
[01:46:09.463 --> 01:46:12.145]  But it's our government luring us into a trap.
[01:46:12.145 --> 01:46:14.026]  It is just so sadistic.
[01:46:14.026 --> 01:46:14.886]  Do you agree with that statement?
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:20.264]  I think they have a plan to remake the world, and this is just the beginning.
[01:46:20.264 --> 01:46:21.486]  They've said it from the very beginning.
[01:46:21.486 --> 01:46:22.406]  Iraq was the beginning.
[01:46:22.406 --> 01:46:23.507]  It was a weakened country.
[01:46:23.507 --> 01:46:27.211]  They had already waged one war on it, sanctioned it for ten years.
[01:46:27.211 --> 01:46:32.015]  They thought it would be an easy object lesson and intimidate the region, and they would barrel forward from there.
[01:46:32.015 --> 01:46:34.518]  Didn't go the way they wanted it to, but they have a plan.
[01:46:35.111 --> 01:46:41.835]  It's basically escape forward, escalate, escalate, because their whole strategic vision of a global empire is on the line there.
[01:46:41.835 --> 01:46:42.876]  It's a Ponzi scheme.
[01:46:42.876 --> 01:46:44.197]  Listen, I appreciate you joining us.
[01:46:44.197 --> 01:46:45.037]  Take care.
[01:46:45.037 --> 01:46:46.558]  And I appreciate your hard work.
[01:46:46.558 --> 01:46:47.639]  Okay, thanks so much, Alex.
[01:46:47.639 --> 01:46:48.179]  Take care.
[01:46:48.179 --> 01:46:48.820]  You bet.
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:52.282]  And Pugs, we're going to go to your calls now and then a bunch of news in the next hour.
[01:46:52.282 --> 01:46:56.725]  It's just... I mean, is this not an illustration of tyranny?
[01:46:56.725 --> 01:47:00.768]  Is this not an illustration of tyranny?
[01:47:00.768 --> 01:47:01.048]  That...
[01:47:03.465 --> 01:47:10.207]  97% don't want toll roads on existing roads, and that's with the public not even knowing how bad they are, or that they're foreign owned.
[01:47:10.207 --> 01:47:15.109]  90% want the borders shut and illegals deported.
[01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:20.111]  90 plus percent don't want national ID cards and all the rest, I mean, none of us want this.
[01:47:20.111 --> 01:47:28.053]  Almost 80% don't want the war, but it just, it continues, because this is not our government!
[01:47:28.053 --> 01:47:30.274]  And I just tell the phony conservatives out there, I mean,
[01:47:31.252 --> 01:47:32.613]  You guys are cult members.
[01:47:32.613 --> 01:47:49.728]  I mean, listen, you repeat the same stuff so many times that I was in a car one day and I was arguing with somebody nicely, you know, just bantering, and I said, watch this, turn your radio on, and the second thing we flipped to was they found WMDs.
[01:47:49.728 --> 01:47:54.071]  I mean, folks, that's because I know, plus at that time, too, there was like a talking points.
[01:47:54.071 --> 01:47:56.013]  They were really pushing it.
[01:47:56.013 --> 01:47:59.416]  I guess that was back in April of last year.
[01:48:02.190 --> 01:48:03.151]  I mean, that's all they do.
[01:48:03.151 --> 01:48:05.973]  It's just all lies.
[01:48:05.973 --> 01:48:07.074]  They're Judas goats.
[01:48:07.074 --> 01:48:15.242]  Folks, Neil Bortz knows that the National Sales Tax is going to be used through the National ID Card at the point of sale for total control.
[01:48:15.242 --> 01:48:17.123]  They're going to keep an income tax on top of it.
[01:48:17.123 --> 01:48:20.667]  I've been saying for 10 years it's a setup because I've read their documents.
[01:48:20.667 --> 01:48:24.050]  It's available.
[01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:26.472]  I mean, these people are wicked.
[01:48:27.202 --> 01:48:30.244]  They know what they're doing.
[01:48:30.244 --> 01:48:33.747]  They're not conservatives.
[01:48:33.747 --> 01:48:37.010]  And at least the lefties will go fight the war.
[01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:39.892]  At least they'll go bullhorn Democrats.
[01:48:39.892 --> 01:48:43.014]  At least they'll do something.
[01:48:43.014 --> 01:48:51.361]  And frankly, if you just act reasonable with the liberals, the grassroots ones, and talk to them, by the time you're done with them, they're out buying guns.
[01:48:53.014 --> 01:49:00.320]  I mean, I found you can really wake up a liberal, because I found that they are at least trying to find the truth a lot of times.
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:03.803]  They're just been indoctrinated like everybody else.
[01:49:03.803 --> 01:49:12.349]  Conservatives are awake in this country, but there's this hard core that do not listen to facts.
[01:49:12.349 --> 01:49:16.192]  Will not and do not listen to facts.
[01:49:16.192 --> 01:49:20.636]  I mean, I have family who will take microchips and have in the military.
[01:49:21.636 --> 01:49:25.998]  I have family that will literally jump off a cliff if they told them to.
[01:49:25.998 --> 01:49:28.579]  That is not how Americans behave.
[01:49:28.579 --> 01:49:30.640]  That is not how Americans act.
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:36.022]  It is not manly to brainwash yourself.
[01:49:36.022 --> 01:49:47.047]  Listen, if some real enemy attacked us, there was some dictator on the news announcing stuff and he was rolling into other countries and he was saying he was going to declare war on my country, I'd go suit up right now.
[01:49:48.556 --> 01:49:50.037]  I mean, I'm not afraid to fight.
[01:49:50.037 --> 01:49:51.178]  I mean, I'd love to.
[01:49:51.178 --> 01:49:52.299]  It's an instinct.
[01:49:52.299 --> 01:49:54.500]  I like fighting.
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:59.124]  But I am an adult, and we have to be wise.
[01:49:59.124 --> 01:50:02.026]  And it is not cute.
[01:50:02.026 --> 01:50:03.067]  It is not studly.
[01:50:03.067 --> 01:50:05.788]  It is not any of this to be lied into a war.
[01:50:05.788 --> 01:50:08.691]  I mean, take the Somalia thing.
[01:50:08.691 --> 01:50:10.792]  It is despicable.
[01:50:10.792 --> 01:50:16.696]  It literally makes me nauseous.
[01:50:16.696 --> 01:50:17.237]  Nauseous.
[01:50:19.753 --> 01:50:31.757]  I got nauseous yesterday and the day before hearing him, yeah, Bush is tough, man, he's the leader we need, he's getting hard on them.
[01:50:31.757 --> 01:50:37.639]  He is hitting those Somalis that killed our troops.
[01:50:37.639 --> 01:50:39.780]  That's what the hosts were announcing.
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:48.483]  When our military has been hijacked and is being used to back up bringing in the warlords to break the country back down again.
[01:50:49.269 --> 01:50:53.292]  Because they have a strategy of keeping countries down.
[01:50:53.292 --> 01:51:06.880]  And man, you can tell one of these good ol' boys, and they'll just, even when it comes out in the news later, which it has, but when it's widely known, they'll just go, well, you gotta work with people.
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:09.321]  That's just how it is.
[01:51:09.321 --> 01:51:12.543]  Yeah, I know Saddam worked for us.
[01:51:12.543 --> 01:51:14.204]  USA, man.
[01:51:14.204 --> 01:51:16.005]  I'm for the troops.
[01:51:16.005 --> 01:51:16.706]  I support them.
[01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:24.215]  I mean, if Gorbachev was our president, would you support the troops when he was given the orders?
[01:51:24.215 --> 01:51:25.957]  I mean, if Hitler was?
[01:51:25.957 --> 01:51:29.361]  I mean, it's just no connection to reality!
[01:51:36.090 --> 01:51:41.915]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:51:41.915 --> 01:51:49.562]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:50.242 --> 01:51:57.705]  TerrorStorm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:57.705 --> 01:52:09.430]  TerrorStorm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:13.392]  TerrorStorm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:52:13.392 --> 01:52:15.653]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:52:15.653 --> 01:52:19.495]  TerrorStorm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:32.688 --> 01:52:36.010]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:52:36.010 --> 01:52:41.192]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:52:41.192 --> 01:52:45.854]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:52:45.854 --> 01:52:54.958]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[01:54:33.573 --> 01:54:40.598]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[01:54:40.598 --> 01:54:44.681]  Some men you just can't reach.
[01:54:44.681 --> 01:54:47.263]  So you get what we had here last week.
[01:54:47.263 --> 01:54:49.885]  Rich is the way he wants.
[01:54:49.885 --> 01:54:50.946]  Well, he is.
[01:54:54.248 --> 01:55:02.797]  I don't like you anymore.
[01:55:02.797 --> 01:55:08.022]  Look at your young men fighting.
[01:55:08.022 --> 01:55:11.125]  Look at your women crying.
[01:55:11.125 --> 01:55:13.608]  Look at your young men dying.
[01:55:15.686 --> 01:55:22.171]  The way they've always done before.
[01:55:22.171 --> 01:55:35.360]  Look at the hate we're breeding.
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:38.862]  Look at the fear we're feeding.
[01:55:40.228 --> 01:55:44.269]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Washington State.
[01:55:44.269 --> 01:55:49.150]  Thanks for holding Mike here on the air worldwide.
[01:56:02.682 --> 01:56:03.843]  Hello Alex, how are you doing?
[01:56:03.843 --> 01:56:04.763]  Good, sir.
[01:56:04.763 --> 01:56:07.805]  Hey, listen, I was on the bus with the Iraqi vets the other night.
[01:56:07.805 --> 01:56:09.707]  I sent you guys that letter.
[01:56:09.707 --> 01:56:13.849]  It was... Oh yeah, was that you and the troops came up and were starting fights?
[01:56:13.849 --> 01:56:14.190]  Yeah.
[01:56:14.190 --> 01:56:15.691]  I just mentioned you to her earlier.
[01:56:15.691 --> 01:56:16.892]  I heard that.
[01:56:16.892 --> 01:56:17.332]  I heard that.
[01:56:17.332 --> 01:56:18.613]  Thanks a lot.
[01:56:18.613 --> 01:56:19.553]  Now tell folks the story.
[01:56:19.553 --> 01:56:23.116]  I know you probably called about something else, but tell that story and then we'll hold you over if we need to.
[01:56:23.116 --> 01:56:29.260]  Okay, well yeah, I was just on the bus with the Iraqi vets supporting Lieutenant Watana there at Fort Lewis.
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:32.162]  And it was about 9 o'clock at night and then all of a sudden there was a couple of
[01:56:33.351 --> 01:56:44.775]  Soldiers at the front of the bus that had snuck up on us, and Purple Heart winner Daryl Anderson went out and started talking to them, and they were accusing Dennis Kind of flipping off the guy's wife.
[01:56:44.775 --> 01:56:48.157]  And Dennis jumps off the bus and says, I didn't flip anybody off!
[01:56:48.157 --> 01:56:51.698]  And then they got all this heated argument, and he wanted to take a walk with him and have a fight.
[01:56:51.698 --> 01:56:57.340]  And it was just, it was really interesting to me, because I could just see him provocateuring the whole thing to make the cause look bad.
[01:56:58.536 --> 01:57:03.678]  And, uh, I don't know if the guy was... Well, I mean, these recruiters are the lowest form of scum.
[01:57:03.678 --> 01:57:10.822]  Coast to coast, they're on tape calling up young people and saying, you'll be arrested if you don't come in and sign your papers.
[01:57:10.822 --> 01:57:11.122]  Yeah.
[01:57:11.122 --> 01:57:13.043]  And then the guys that do that get promoted.
[01:57:13.043 --> 01:57:19.426]  This is a criminal... Again, even if you're for your sickening war, folks, it's being implemented and carried out in a criminal fashion.
[01:57:19.426 --> 01:57:21.847]  The Pentagon's engaging in domestic propaganda.
[01:57:21.847 --> 01:57:23.127]  That's illegal!
[01:57:23.127 --> 01:57:25.669]  This is America, you Nazi pigs!
[01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:26.429]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:57:27.051 --> 01:57:34.554]  Well, then I was on the bus, and I remembered what I learned from listening to you guys, and I had my camera with me, and I figured, oh yeah, I got my camera, I'll get rid of them.
[01:57:34.554 --> 01:57:37.195]  So I went out and took at least a couple of flats.
[01:57:37.195 --> 01:57:38.936]  That made the cockroaches run off, didn't it?
[01:57:38.936 --> 01:57:39.936]  Yeah, yeah, they ran.
[01:57:39.936 --> 01:57:41.017]  They ran from the light.
[01:57:41.017 --> 01:57:41.457]  It was great.
[01:57:41.457 --> 01:57:44.798]  I was just getting ready to start taking their pictures, and they said, well, we're out of here.
[01:57:44.798 --> 01:57:45.599]  You guys have a good one.
[01:57:45.599 --> 01:57:46.679]  Take care.
[01:57:46.679 --> 01:57:49.020]  And then the next day, the landowner made them move the bus.
[01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:49.880]  So they got their way.
[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:53.642]  Well, that's what they're all about, frustrating free speech.
[01:57:54.409 --> 01:57:54.949]  Yep.
[01:57:54.949 --> 01:58:00.531]  But didn't somebody, because you've got real Iraq vets there, and there's these big fat recruiters who can weigh 800 pounds now?
[01:58:00.531 --> 01:58:07.753]  Yeah, yeah, Dennis Kine, he says, he was in the first Gulf War, and he looks at the guy and he says, go meet the high weight standard.
[01:58:07.753 --> 01:58:19.436]  I thought he was, you know, saying he's too small for them to fight him or something, but I guess the guy was like way out of shape to even be a soldier, let alone, you know, make it in the, he's just there trying to cause problems.
[01:58:19.436 --> 01:58:20.516]  They're cowardly, Phil.
[01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:28.426]  They lie to the young people, they do whatever they can to get them in that meat grinder so they can dose them with DU and deadly experimental shots.
[01:58:28.426 --> 01:58:30.448]  This is not our military, okay?
[01:58:30.448 --> 01:58:31.228]  Period.
[01:58:31.228 --> 01:58:34.291]  Hell, it's gonna be half-foreigner by the end of this decade.
[01:58:34.291 --> 01:58:40.916]  They'll make us get out and have parades for the foreign military we're gonna have.
[01:58:40.916 --> 01:58:43.018]  It's so sick.
[01:58:43.018 --> 01:58:45.400]  Alex, I've got a cartoon you might be interested in for your new movie.
[01:58:46.461 --> 01:58:53.147]  It's a banned Disney cartoon called Education for Death, The Making of a Nazi.
[01:58:53.147 --> 01:58:53.947]  Oh really?
[01:58:53.947 --> 01:58:55.128]  Tell me about it on the other side.
[01:58:55.128 --> 01:58:59.011]  I've got one where they talk about Adolf Hitler hailing New World Order.
[01:58:59.011 --> 01:59:01.233]  Adolf Hitler's New World Order!
[01:59:01.233 --> 01:59:01.734]  Stay there.
[01:59:01.734 --> 01:59:02.935]  I want to hear about it.
[01:59:02.935 --> 01:59:04.136]  I think I've seen it.
[01:59:04.136 --> 01:59:06.858]  I think I've seen it.
[01:59:06.858 --> 01:59:08.279]  Very artsy.
[01:59:08.279 --> 01:59:10.761]  We'll be right back with the third hour of transmission.

[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:24.322]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:24.322 --> 02:00:33.627]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:33.627 --> 02:00:34.948]  Big Brother.
[02:00:34.948 --> 02:00:36.709]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:37.890]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:37.890 --> 02:00:40.071]  You want answers?
[02:00:40.071 --> 02:00:41.632]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:41.632 --> 02:00:45.795]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:45.795 --> 02:00:49.858]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:51.038 --> 02:01:16.070]  On a side, many a young maid lost her bottles to my train.
[02:01:18.763 --> 02:01:28.409]  Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.
[02:01:28.409 --> 02:01:31.251]  The masters hung me in the spring of 1941.
[02:01:31.251 --> 02:01:35.533]  Mike in Washington State, which is bringing up a banned Disney cartoon.
[02:01:35.533 --> 02:01:36.514]  Tell us more about it, Mike.
[02:01:36.514 --> 02:01:46.140]  It just starts out, it's called The Making of a Nazi, and it just goes into saying that it starts as soon as they're a child, and it talks about eugenics and
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:52.085]  And Goebbels and Geriger in it.
[02:01:52.085 --> 02:01:53.225]  It's an interesting cartoon.
[02:01:53.225 --> 02:02:02.513]  I was just curious if you had seen it, and if not, I was going to send it to you.
[02:02:02.513 --> 02:02:12.282]  They said I got killed, but I'm living still.
[02:02:12.282 --> 02:02:13.563]  I was a damn building,
[02:02:14.494 --> 02:02:42.529]  Across the river deep and wide Where steel and water did collide A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound But I'm still around
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:48.525]  I'll always be around and around and around and around and around.
[02:02:59.198 --> 02:03:26.151]  I'll fly a starship across the universe divide And when I reach the other side I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can Perhaps I may become a highwayman again Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
[02:03:28.348 --> 02:03:37.866]  But I will remain I'll be back again and again and again and again and again
[02:04:05.979 --> 02:04:10.541]  Look out your window, babe, and have a scene you'd like to catch.
[02:04:10.541 --> 02:04:12.681]  Man, he's playing Dixie.
[02:04:12.681 --> 02:04:15.702]  Man, got his hand out stressed.
[02:04:15.702 --> 02:04:18.103]  Could be the viola.
[02:04:18.103 --> 02:04:22.945]  Could be the low-carb breeze.
[02:04:22.945 --> 02:04:28.387]  Well, there's sometimes, sometimes, you know, we come out
[02:04:34.131 --> 02:04:36.532]  We got sweet kids to get.
[02:04:36.532 --> 02:04:39.053]  We got harmonious time.
[02:04:39.053 --> 02:04:43.854]  So every song of love that ever has been sung.
[02:04:43.854 --> 02:04:46.815]  Pretty intentions can be evil.
[02:04:46.815 --> 02:04:48.796]  Both hands can be full of grief.
[02:04:48.796 --> 02:04:54.538]  Don't let sunshine stay dry.
[02:04:54.538 --> 02:04:55.458]  Don't let
[02:05:03.343 --> 02:05:08.825]  Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front.
[02:05:08.825 --> 02:05:12.827]  Both eyes are looking like they're on a rabbit hunt.
[02:05:12.827 --> 02:05:18.470]  Nobody's listening to him, not even the chief of police.
[02:05:32.182 --> 02:05:38.011]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:05:38.011 --> 02:05:45.662]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:46.337 --> 02:05:53.780]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:53.780 --> 02:06:05.524]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:06:05.524 --> 02:06:09.486]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:06:09.486 --> 02:06:11.746]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:11.746 --> 02:06:15.588]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:06:29.801 --> 02:06:31.122]  Good morning, honey.

[02:06:37.385 --> 02:06:38.386]  Yeah.

[02:06:40.147 --> 02:06:44.029]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[02:06:44.029 --> 02:06:45.970]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:06:45.970 --> 02:06:48.051]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:06:48.051 --> 02:06:49.812]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:06:50.012 --> 02:06:51.292]  Honey, cheer up!
[02:06:51.292 --> 02:06:53.813]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[02:06:53.813 --> 02:06:54.574]  What?
[02:06:54.574 --> 02:07:05.337]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[02:07:05.337 --> 02:07:07.738]  You know, this is a terrific cabin!
[02:07:07.738 --> 02:07:10.179]  And wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[02:07:10.499 --> 02:07:11.780]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[02:07:28.626 --> 02:07:29.547]  Attention!
[02:07:29.547 --> 02:07:31.087]  Attention everyone!
[02:07:31.087 --> 02:07:33.628]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:07:33.628 --> 02:07:35.369]  It's called Wrist Ease.
[02:07:35.369 --> 02:07:38.330]  The new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[02:07:38.988 --> 02:07:46.353]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[02:07:46.353 --> 02:07:59.681]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[02:07:59.681 --> 02:08:04.124]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[02:08:04.124 --> 02:08:08.087]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and
[02:08:08.667 --> 02:08:14.568]  Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.

[02:08:30.171 --> 02:08:32.831]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:32.831 --> 02:08:35.672]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:45.988]  We are sailing right along here by sound a bit different because our ISDN line connection to Minnesota here from Austin, Texas went down.
[02:08:45.988 --> 02:08:48.671]  And we're trying to reestablish that.
[02:08:48.671 --> 02:08:51.654]  Of course, it's the network's end.
[02:08:51.654 --> 02:08:54.637]  But let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[02:08:54.637 --> 02:08:57.539]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don in New York.
[02:08:57.539 --> 02:08:58.480]  Thanks for holding, Don.
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:08:58.941]  You're on the air.
[02:08:59.893 --> 02:09:00.994]  Oh, hi Alex.
[02:09:00.994 --> 02:09:03.815]  I was getting numb here, sitting here.
[02:09:03.815 --> 02:09:04.696]  Well, you're on the air now.
[02:09:04.696 --> 02:09:05.376]  You want to talk?
[02:09:05.376 --> 02:09:06.537]  Yeah.
[02:09:06.537 --> 02:09:15.723]  I wanted to encourage you first that God's got the heel on power and that's why you need to, on air, believe that He could do it.
[02:09:15.723 --> 02:09:18.624]  And then they're a witness for God.
[02:09:18.624 --> 02:09:21.826]  I understand all that, sir, and I have faith in God.
[02:09:21.826 --> 02:09:22.647]  I was just earlier
[02:09:23.300 --> 02:09:25.541]  I was just trying to encourage you, that's all.
[02:09:25.541 --> 02:09:26.341]  No, I understand, Don.
[02:09:26.341 --> 02:09:27.421]  That's very nice of you.
[02:09:27.421 --> 02:09:42.567]  But what I was saying earlier was that everybody's got really bad allergies, and I was mainly talking about it on air to ask the question to the people, why are allergies so prevalent now when they weren't just a few decades ago?
[02:09:42.567 --> 02:09:44.687]  I wasn't really talking about myself.
[02:09:44.687 --> 02:09:48.709]  No, I was just saying that I wanted to stay on subject of what you were talking about
[02:09:52.657 --> 02:09:53.417]  I don't think so.
[02:10:23.096 --> 02:10:25.918]  It was just our great leader making a pronouncement to us.
[02:10:25.918 --> 02:10:27.579]  I know, it was very bizarre.
[02:10:27.579 --> 02:10:40.365]  And again, he talks about surging troops, 22,000 additional, but that just allows the Democrats to then fight the surge, not fight being in Iraq overall.
[02:10:40.365 --> 02:10:46.408]  So the question is, if the Democrats were sent to Congress to get us out of the war, why are they keeping us in the war?
[02:10:46.408 --> 02:10:49.109]  And the answer is, because the people don't run this country.
[02:10:49.620 --> 02:10:53.902]  And as soon as we start admitting how bad things have really gotten, we can then turn it around.
[02:10:53.902 --> 02:10:57.243]  But what did you think of the speech overall, Don?
[02:10:57.243 --> 02:10:59.905]  I see it as just propaganda since the 70s.
[02:10:59.905 --> 02:11:12.010]  I was always worried about this happening, that if the media is ever to be completely controlled, that we'd only hear propaganda and no indoctrination, basically, is what it is.
[02:11:12.010 --> 02:11:13.270]  It's all indoctrination.
[02:11:13.270 --> 02:11:13.851]  There is no...
[02:11:15.046 --> 02:11:18.848]  Every time you say anything that's truth, it's your opinion, your opinion.
[02:11:18.848 --> 02:11:35.357]  I keep hearing this crap for... And then I saw patterns with our clothing of all the... For 15, 20 years, people act like I'm nuts, telling them, why are we paying full price for clothing like it's made in the Union in America?
[02:11:35.357 --> 02:11:37.758]  And so I saw these signs a long time ago.
[02:11:38.784 --> 02:11:40.685]  No, you can't try and close me in America.
[02:11:40.685 --> 02:11:44.466]  Thank you so much, Don, and thank you for saying that God is the answer.
[02:11:44.466 --> 02:11:46.147]  I totally agree with you.
[02:11:46.147 --> 02:12:00.213]  It's just that you getting healed on error and believing that God is the one, and that is Jesus Christ, the God, not just any God, because God is now any God that you, you know, in God we trust the money.
[02:12:00.213 --> 02:12:06.836]  No, we talk about Jesus here on the air, but if you want to get right down to the names,
[02:12:08.055 --> 02:12:13.477]  The name Jesus isn't the name, so I understand, but we all know who we're talking about here.
[02:12:13.477 --> 02:12:19.279]  I really appreciate you coming on the show.
[02:12:19.279 --> 02:12:29.242]  Look, bottom line here, the reason I talk about my allergies on air is because I sounded like a giant toad, and I just haven't sounded like myself for almost two weeks.
[02:12:29.938 --> 02:12:35.683]  So, if I'm a bit irritable or a bit stuffy sounding, I'm just letting people know why.
[02:12:35.683 --> 02:12:40.447]  And then I was kind of marveling on, my gosh, these allergies have really gotten bad for the general public.
[02:12:40.447 --> 02:12:46.272]  I am not big on the faith healers and not big on, you know, that whole kind of evangelical thing.
[02:12:46.272 --> 02:12:48.895]  I know that God can heal people and who God does.
[02:12:48.895 --> 02:12:50.356]  I know Jesus did.
[02:12:50.356 --> 02:12:51.737]  Galway.
[02:12:51.737 --> 02:12:53.559]  I understand all that, sir.
[02:12:53.559 --> 02:12:54.900]  But this is a news show.
[02:12:55.740 --> 02:13:01.943]  And so, uh, that's what I've, you know, just been discussing and talking about here on Air Don, but thank you.
[02:13:01.943 --> 02:13:03.704]  Uh, Jay, where are you calling us from today?
[02:13:08.141 --> 02:13:08.661]  Okay.
[02:13:08.661 --> 02:13:09.841]  Are you speaking to me, Alex?
[02:13:09.841 --> 02:13:10.722]  Yeah, whatever your name is.
[02:13:10.722 --> 02:13:11.322]  Go ahead, go on.
[02:13:11.322 --> 02:13:12.102]  It's Jerry.
[02:13:12.102 --> 02:13:12.442]  Okay.
[02:13:12.442 --> 02:13:14.423]  Yeah, I spoke to you last week on the 3rd.
[02:13:14.423 --> 02:13:17.263]  I'm sorry, I was sitting here and I thought you said John.
[02:13:17.263 --> 02:13:17.884]  It doesn't matter.
[02:13:17.884 --> 02:13:18.604]  We're a disaster.
[02:13:18.604 --> 02:13:19.664]  It doesn't really matter, but go ahead.
[02:13:19.664 --> 02:13:20.124]  That's alright.
[02:13:20.124 --> 02:13:21.664]  Well, forgive me.
[02:13:21.664 --> 02:13:26.866]  You know, there's a couple of things I want to talk about and you remember Shirley Anderson last week on the 3rd?
[02:13:26.866 --> 02:13:28.146]  She was on your show.
[02:13:28.146 --> 02:13:28.966]  Yes.
[02:13:28.966 --> 02:13:30.927]  She was pummeled by the cops.
[02:13:30.927 --> 02:13:31.147]  Yes.
[02:13:31.147 --> 02:13:33.527]  I just wanted to give you kind of an update.
[02:13:33.527 --> 02:13:35.448]  I'm basically her advocate now.
[02:13:36.862 --> 02:13:41.165]  Well, let's give people some background because we're going to have a private discussion right now.
[02:13:41.165 --> 02:13:42.006]  I'm sorry.
[02:13:42.006 --> 02:13:43.187]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:13:43.187 --> 02:13:46.410]  So there's nothing for you to be sorry about, but please quit saying you're sorry.
[02:13:46.410 --> 02:13:48.072]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[02:13:48.072 --> 02:13:51.414]  No one has to grovel to me because I'm a radio talk show host, okay?
[02:13:51.414 --> 02:13:52.395]  Got you that.
[02:13:52.395 --> 02:13:54.858]  All right.
[02:13:54.858 --> 02:13:57.660]  So, so just, just, let's just stop right there.
[02:13:57.660 --> 02:13:59.381]  Let's just stop right there.
[02:13:59.381 --> 02:14:00.863]  Okay?
[02:14:00.863 --> 02:14:02.064]  Now, this is a lady.
[02:14:02.623 --> 02:14:08.487]  Last week, who we had on, who got beat up by the police for handing out my videos and other videos and writing a letter to the editor.
[02:14:08.487 --> 02:14:10.389]  Okay, go ahead now.
[02:14:10.389 --> 02:14:22.878]  Well, it looks like instead of the court taking place in this small town that it wouldn't be a good place to have it, especially when they were giving her, what do you call it when they give you your own lawyer?
[02:14:22.878 --> 02:14:23.378]  Court appointed.
[02:14:23.925 --> 02:14:24.966]  Yeah.
[02:14:24.966 --> 02:14:26.727]  Well, I found her an attorney, of course.
[02:14:26.727 --> 02:14:28.189]  I told you that last week.
[02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:29.189]  Yeah, thank you for doing that.
[02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:30.010]  You're very nice.
[02:14:30.010 --> 02:14:31.251]  Hey, not a problem.
[02:14:31.251 --> 02:14:33.113]  Glad to do it.
[02:14:33.113 --> 02:14:37.416]  It looks like it's going to go to federal court instead.
[02:14:37.416 --> 02:14:37.657]  Really?
[02:14:37.657 --> 02:14:44.202]  Yeah, it looks like it's going to go straight to federal court because this attorney is going full bore on this one.
[02:14:44.202 --> 02:14:47.705]  I want to just leave it at that, if you know what I mean.
[02:14:47.705 --> 02:14:48.826]  I don't want to give out too much.
[02:14:48.826 --> 02:14:50.707]  Hopefully there's not the wrong people listening.
[02:14:52.467 --> 02:15:01.852]  I mean, again, they clearly violated her God-given rights or civil rights, whatever they want to call it, and so you found them a lawyer to go on the offensive.
[02:15:01.852 --> 02:15:02.572]  Correct.
[02:15:02.572 --> 02:15:03.592]  Well, good job, man.
[02:15:03.592 --> 02:15:06.474]  I mean, that's what we try to do is have these occasional guests on.
[02:15:06.474 --> 02:15:11.276]  We had two on that day being harassed by the authorities, the officials.
[02:15:11.276 --> 02:15:15.058]  Another thing, you're talking about allergies in your town or your city.
[02:15:16.067 --> 02:15:20.609]  If you guys had a bunch of chemtrail activity in the last month or something, is it possible?
[02:15:20.609 --> 02:15:22.249]  Massive, total, complete chemtrails.
[02:15:22.249 --> 02:15:25.090]  But see, this is the difference.
[02:15:25.090 --> 02:15:33.394]  A chemical trail normally sprayed at 10,000 to 30,000 feet isn't dispersed directly below where it's being released.
[02:15:33.394 --> 02:15:42.417]  Now, in the tens of thousands of declassified admissions of chemical, biological, and radiological releases, they've used small, fixed-wing like Cessna or Pyverse.
[02:15:43.354 --> 02:15:45.395]  Or they've used helicopters to deploy it.
[02:15:45.395 --> 02:15:49.596]  You can find hundreds of mainstream news articles and seminaries about it.
[02:15:49.596 --> 02:16:00.360]  Everyone seems to think the biological and chemical spraying of the American people is taking place from large jet aircraft up in the jet stream.
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:09.923]  And that is more the evidence that points towards a larger weather modification and over-the-horizon radar program.
[02:16:10.861 --> 02:16:17.267]  But there's all these books written, all these people that talk, but nothing I've ever seen, other than what I've seen in the papers and from research.
[02:16:17.267 --> 02:16:25.473]  No one ever wants to talk about all the admissions of chemical, biological, radiological testing on the American people.
[02:16:25.473 --> 02:16:32.079]  So I have no doubt that there couldn't be problems associated with that.
[02:16:32.079 --> 02:16:33.820]  I'm thinking the same thing.
[02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:36.623]  One more thing and I'll let you go.
[02:16:36.623 --> 02:16:39.425]  This morning, I caught George Bush.
[02:16:40.106 --> 02:16:50.890]  Well, I mean, I've got a video of him getting off a helicopter a few months ago at the Crawford movie set where he acts like a cowboy to fool everybody, though he's scared of horses.
[02:17:10.071 --> 02:17:15.493]  The Cowardly, Kenny Runport, Chicken Neck, and the Carpetbagger.
[02:17:15.493 --> 02:17:24.717]  Not against Yankees folks, but if I was up in the North posing as a Northerner, it'd be a joke if I came in and put on their dress and started talking like them.
[02:17:24.717 --> 02:17:29.759]  He just gives Texas a bad name and I'm sick of it, the Cowardly Piece of Filth.
[02:17:29.759 --> 02:17:31.919]  I'm tired of Carpetbaggers, period.
[02:17:31.919 --> 02:17:32.420]  I'm with you.
[02:17:37.212 --> 02:17:39.713]  Uh, I mean, I've got video of him stumbling off a helicopter.
[02:17:39.713 --> 02:17:41.834]  Him and Laura are completely drunk.
[02:17:41.834 --> 02:17:42.374]  Oh, boy.
[02:17:42.374 --> 02:17:43.754]  And, I mean, you know, it's a free country.
[02:17:43.754 --> 02:17:45.515]  Bush is allowed to get drunk.
[02:17:45.515 --> 02:17:46.715]  And people get drunk.
[02:17:46.715 --> 02:17:49.276]  I've been drunk before myself, though I don't really drink anymore.
[02:17:49.276 --> 02:17:50.917]  I might have a drink here or there.
[02:17:50.917 --> 02:17:51.757]  I shouldn't even do that.
[02:17:51.757 --> 02:17:56.058]  Uh, but, uh, you know, the point is it's the lying about it.
[02:17:56.058 --> 02:18:01.560]  You know, it's the, uh, and alcohol is destructive when you, you know, get into it heavily.
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:03.921]  And, uh, I mean, we know he's a coke head.
[02:18:04.972 --> 02:18:08.055]  I mean, everybody in Texas knows that from his college days.
[02:18:08.055 --> 02:18:12.919]  And we know he got a DWI, and we know that people that write about it get killed.
[02:18:12.919 --> 02:18:15.142]  So, you know, that's just your president.
[02:18:15.142 --> 02:18:15.902]  Right.
[02:18:15.902 --> 02:18:17.103]  And we'll leave it at that.
[02:18:17.103 --> 02:18:17.764]  All right.
[02:18:17.764 --> 02:18:19.546]  Listen, I really appreciate you, sir.
[02:18:19.546 --> 02:18:20.967]  And I'm sorry I got your name wrong, Jerry.
[02:18:20.967 --> 02:18:23.990]  I had it written down here as Jay.
[02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:27.073]  So I really do appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:18:27.073 --> 02:18:30.155]  Let's talk to Kevin in Boston, if I can get names straight.
[02:18:30.155 --> 02:18:30.636]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:18:31.115 --> 02:18:32.216]  Hi, thanks Alex.
[02:18:32.216 --> 02:18:35.339]  Your show may be a disaster, but it's only a disaster for the New World Order.
[02:18:35.339 --> 02:18:39.442]  No, no, that was a disaster because both ISDN lines have a backup.
[02:18:39.442 --> 02:18:44.246]  Both of them went down and then, you know, it's just everything.
[02:18:44.246 --> 02:18:51.773]  Well, you've got a good show going and I'm one of those former liberals that you woke up and now I'm a blogger on AWRM.org, World Regulated Militia.
[02:18:51.773 --> 02:18:52.734]  You were right on
[02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:56.871]  You know, the callers were calling in about that Leo Wanta story.
[02:18:56.871 --> 02:18:57.552]  Terrible.
[02:18:57.552 --> 02:19:10.922]  And lo and behold, a day later, The Cloak's own website puts up, there were only two posts for the other day, two stories, kind of semi-retractions, one by Greg Simansky and one by V.K.
[02:19:10.922 --> 02:19:17.547]  Durham, kind of questioning now Leo Wanta's credibility when they've been pumping this story up and raising some hopes.
[02:19:17.547 --> 02:19:18.067]  Oh, please.
[02:19:18.067 --> 02:19:18.828]  Just give me a break.
[02:19:19.349 --> 02:19:22.632]  Nukes are going to blow up Houston one day, then it's something the next.
[02:19:22.632 --> 02:19:26.495]  You know, my predictions, unfortunately, have come true.
[02:19:26.495 --> 02:19:30.399]  And things I've talked about are real, because I really try to give people the facts.
[02:19:30.399 --> 02:19:32.120]  I really research this stuff.
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:37.445]  And, you know, I've got a decent brain on my shoulders.
[02:19:37.445 --> 02:19:39.146]  And I'm not even trying to attack people.
[02:19:39.146 --> 02:19:43.130]  It's just that this stuff is destroying our movement.
[02:19:43.130 --> 02:19:44.171]  And I've had enough of it.
[02:19:44.171 --> 02:19:45.372]  I've had enough of space beams.
[02:19:46.144 --> 02:19:50.466]  I've had enough of, uh, you know, magical trillions that somebody's got.
[02:19:50.466 --> 02:19:53.908]  That's one step up above from the emails you get.
[02:19:53.908 --> 02:19:55.308]  I'm a Nigerian prince!
[02:19:55.308 --> 02:19:59.450]  Send me, you know, send me four thousand, I'll send you ten million!
[02:19:59.450 --> 02:20:08.215]  Well, you explain how, you know, New World Order techniques, Order of Kale works, but, uh, you know, just like you said, I wanted to keep things positive.
[02:20:08.215 --> 02:20:15.198]  They have some of the same guests that you have on, and they do put out some good stuff occasionally, but I wanted to ask you, how do you, um,
[02:20:15.674 --> 02:20:17.657]  I'll comment on that when we get back.
[02:20:17.657 --> 02:20:18.359]  It's a perfect segue.
[02:20:29.321 --> 02:20:34.823]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:20:34.823 --> 02:20:37.143]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:20:37.143 --> 02:20:44.386]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:20:44.386 --> 02:20:55.909]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[02:20:56.289 --> 02:21:03.955]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible sorts of auxiliary backup power.
[02:21:03.955 --> 02:21:09.079]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[02:21:09.079 --> 02:21:14.384]  Disconnect your application, and the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[02:21:14.384 --> 02:21:19.788]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:21:19.788 --> 02:21:20.789]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:21:20.789 --> 02:21:21.309]  That's toll-free,
[02:21:29.215 --> 02:21:37.419]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America by the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[02:21:37.419 --> 02:21:42.202]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[02:21:42.202 --> 02:21:49.226]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[02:21:50.111 --> 02:21:59.559]  You need to know as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America why these things are happening and what you can do about it.
[02:21:59.559 --> 02:22:05.144]  We'd like to offer you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:22:05.144 --> 02:22:05.645]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[02:22:05.645 --> 02:22:05.945]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:22:14.347 --> 02:22:17.469]  516-8736.
[02:22:17.469 --> 02:22:18.409]  Just call today.
[02:22:18.409 --> 02:22:21.631]  Our operators are standing by to take your subscription.
[02:22:21.631 --> 02:22:30.676]  It's absolutely free.
[02:22:30.676 --> 02:22:33.918]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:22:36.405 --> 02:22:41.449]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:22:41.449 --> 02:22:44.232]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:22:44.232 --> 02:22:46.674]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:22:46.674 --> 02:22:52.198]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:22:52.198 --> 02:23:00.465]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:23:00.465 --> 02:23:03.548]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:23:05.658 --> 02:23:10.099]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:23:10.099 --> 02:23:11.619]  Call for your copy today.
[02:23:11.619 --> 02:23:14.880]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:21.422]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:23:21.422 --> 02:23:21.882]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:21.882 --> 02:23:22.082]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:29.776 --> 02:23:30.897]  It's no secret.
[02:23:30.897 --> 02:23:36.559]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[02:23:36.559 --> 02:23:41.661]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[02:23:41.661 --> 02:23:44.162]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[02:23:44.162 --> 02:23:47.003]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called Novo.
[02:23:47.003 --> 02:23:55.326]  Novo eliminates the bacterial growth, which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration, which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[02:23:55.326 --> 02:23:59.508]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in Novo.
[02:23:59.548 --> 02:23:59.968]  I think so.
[02:24:30.009 --> 02:24:32.931]  Alright.
[02:24:32.931 --> 02:24:36.813]  People ask me,
[02:25:00.683 --> 02:25:06.087]  How I recognize this information.
[02:25:06.087 --> 02:25:09.149]  And really it's been in this game this long.
[02:25:09.149 --> 02:25:17.055]  It's known who the players are, watching people, studying different organizations, different groups, and really watching MO.
[02:25:17.055 --> 02:25:24.900]  But the biggest thing is, you go to most of these Patriot sites, all they do is attack other people.
[02:25:24.900 --> 02:25:26.802]  That's all they do.
[02:25:26.802 --> 02:25:28.643]  Now most of them do it because of ego.
[02:25:29.958 --> 02:25:31.479]  They're crazy.
[02:25:31.479 --> 02:25:32.800]  They're egomaniacs.
[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:37.263]  They're fighting the New World Order because they want to be aristocrats themselves.
[02:25:37.263 --> 02:25:38.945]  You know, that's what the elite thinks we all want.
[02:25:38.945 --> 02:25:44.288]  The elite thinks anyone who's fighting them is really just some rogue group who would like to supplant them.
[02:25:44.288 --> 02:25:46.350]  And to a certain extent, that's true.
[02:25:46.350 --> 02:25:58.759]  I mean, just because the elite are fallen... Just because the elite are fallen doesn't mean
[02:26:33.493 --> 02:27:00.781]  Stand me up at the gates of hell But I won't back down No, I'll stand my ground Won't be turned around And I'll keep this world from dragging me down Gonna stand my ground And I won't back down
[02:27:04.213 --> 02:27:26.183]  Hey, baby There ain't no easy way out Hey, yeah You stand to my ground And I won't back down Well, I know what's right
[02:27:34.226 --> 02:27:41.809]  You're pushing me around, but I'll stand my ground, and I won't back down.
[02:27:41.809 --> 02:27:42.530]  Hey, baby!
[02:27:42.530 --> 02:27:45.791]  There ain't no easy way out.
[02:27:45.791 --> 02:27:47.392]  Hey, yeah!
[02:27:47.392 --> 02:27:50.633]  I'll stand my ground, and I won't back down.
[02:28:31.494 --> 02:28:36.058]  There ain't no easy way out.
[02:28:36.058 --> 02:28:37.659]  Hey, yeah.
[02:28:37.659 --> 02:28:40.242]  Walk back down.
[02:28:40.242 --> 02:28:41.483]  Hey, baby.
[02:28:41.483 --> 02:28:44.545]  There ain't no easy way out.
[02:28:44.545 --> 02:28:45.406]  Hey, yeah.
[02:28:45.406 --> 02:28:48.569]  Stand on my ground.
[02:29:13.206 --> 02:29:26.577]  Oh my goodness what a lot of fun today boy I can tell you what this is uh this has really been really been a lot of fun we are back got our ISDN line stuff
[02:29:28.506 --> 02:29:30.778]  Somewhat straightened up, hopefully.
[02:30:19.550 --> 02:30:23.474]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:23.474 --> 02:30:26.176]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:31.454 --> 02:30:35.818]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:30:35.818 --> 02:30:37.840]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:30:37.840 --> 02:30:44.426]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:30:44.426 --> 02:30:50.792]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:30:50.792 --> 02:30:52.634]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:30:52.894 --> 02:30:53.314]  I think so.
[02:31:16.559 --> 02:31:19.062]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[02:31:19.062 --> 02:31:19.482]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[02:31:19.482 --> 02:31:19.542]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:31:29.534 --> 02:31:33.697]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[02:31:33.697 --> 02:31:37.520]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[02:31:37.520 --> 02:31:41.903]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[02:31:41.903 --> 02:31:43.064]  I was so amazed.
[02:31:43.064 --> 02:31:46.106]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[02:31:46.106 --> 02:31:47.968]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[02:31:48.348 --> 02:31:54.030]  SoleilWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[02:31:54.030 --> 02:32:00.211]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[02:32:00.211 --> 02:32:02.192]  I figured it would clean really well.
[02:32:02.192 --> 02:32:05.573]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[02:32:05.573 --> 02:32:09.714]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[02:32:09.714 --> 02:32:11.194]  Plus, the service was great.
[02:32:11.534 --> 02:32:16.722]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit Soleilwellness.com.
[02:32:16.722 --> 02:32:20.046]  That's S-O-L-A-Y wellness dot com.
[02:32:20.046 --> 02:32:20.527]  Or call 312-224-2710.
[02:32:20.527 --> 02:32:20.567]  312-224-2710.
[02:32:29.105 --> 02:32:30.926]  Shelly, you look exu... Oh, wait!
[02:32:30.926 --> 02:32:32.027]  Why did you turn that down?
[02:32:32.027 --> 02:32:35.128]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[02:32:35.128 --> 02:32:39.790]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[02:32:39.790 --> 02:32:42.492]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[02:32:42.492 --> 02:32:43.672]  I could use something like that.
[02:32:43.672 --> 02:32:46.233]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[02:32:46.233 --> 02:32:49.195]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[02:32:49.195 --> 02:32:51.096]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[02:32:51.096 --> 02:32:53.737]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[02:32:53.737 --> 02:32:54.758]  I guess you're right.
[02:32:54.758 --> 02:32:55.618]  Why don't we try it?
[02:32:55.618 --> 02:32:57.559]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[02:32:57.979 --> 02:33:02.701]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[02:33:02.701 --> 02:33:04.482]  I know where we can get some more information.
[02:33:04.482 --> 02:33:09.043]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[02:33:09.043 --> 02:33:12.585]  The BedFan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.

[02:33:17.206 --> 02:33:18.647]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[02:33:18.647 --> 02:33:20.208]  The BedFan is the answer.
[02:33:20.208 --> 02:33:23.829]  Visit us today at www.bedfan.com.
[02:33:23.829 --> 02:33:26.490]  That's www.bedfan.com.
[02:33:26.690 --> 02:33:27.691]  That's bad.
[02:33:27.691 --> 02:33:30.513]  F-A-N-Dot.
[02:33:30.513 --> 02:33:41.321]  They railed against the crown.
[02:33:41.321 --> 02:33:44.844]  Another ragtag band.
[02:33:44.844 --> 02:33:47.827]  Declaring independence.
[02:33:51.144 --> 02:33:52.805]  Impulsive consumers.
[02:33:52.805 --> 02:33:56.587]  They think of that as their national pride.
[02:33:56.587 --> 02:33:58.087]  It's their civic duty.
[02:33:58.087 --> 02:33:58.788]  Consumption.
[02:33:58.788 --> 02:34:00.388]  It's the new national pastime.
[02:34:00.388 --> 02:34:01.889]  It's consumption.
[02:34:01.889 --> 02:34:05.651]  The only true lasting American value that's left.
[02:34:05.651 --> 02:34:07.192]  Buying things.
[02:34:07.192 --> 02:34:08.072]  Buying things.
[02:34:08.072 --> 02:34:10.913]  People spending money they don't have on things they don't need.
[02:34:10.913 --> 02:34:13.054]  Money they don't have on things they don't need.
[02:34:13.054 --> 02:34:17.636]  So they can max out their credit cards and spend the rest of their lives paying 18% interest on something that costs $12.50.
[02:34:19.401 --> 02:34:21.843]  And they didn't like it when they got it home anyway.
[02:34:21.843 --> 02:34:22.863]  Not too bright, folks.
[02:34:22.863 --> 02:34:32.069]  But if you talk to one of them about this, if you isolate one of them, you sit them down rationally, and you talk to them about the low IQs and the dumb behavior and the bad decisions, right away they start talking about education.
[02:34:32.069 --> 02:34:33.410]  That's the big answer to everything.
[02:34:33.410 --> 02:34:34.270]  Education.
[02:34:34.270 --> 02:34:35.971]  They say, we need more money for education.
[02:34:35.971 --> 02:34:39.233]  We need more books, more teachers, more classrooms, more schools.
[02:34:39.233 --> 02:34:41.135]  We need more testing for the kids.
[02:34:41.135 --> 02:34:45.537]  You say to them, well, you know, we've tried all of that, and the kids still can't pass the test.
[02:34:45.537 --> 02:34:46.718]  They say, ah, don't you worry about that.
[02:34:46.718 --> 02:34:48.139]  We're going to lower the passing grades.
[02:34:49.210 --> 02:34:52.874]  That's what they do in a lot of these schools now, they lower the passing grades so more kids can pass.
[02:34:52.874 --> 02:35:00.283]  More kids pass, the school looks good, everybody's happy, the IQ of the country slips another two or three points, and pretty soon all you'll need to get into college is a pencil!
[02:35:01.753 --> 02:35:06.097]  And everyone wonders why 17 other countries graduate more scientists than we do.
[02:35:06.097 --> 02:35:07.418]  Education!
[02:35:07.418 --> 02:35:08.599]  Politicians know that word.
[02:35:08.599 --> 02:35:09.739]  They use it on you.
[02:35:09.739 --> 02:35:12.942]  Politicians have traditionally hidden behind three things.
[02:35:12.942 --> 02:35:15.524]  The flag, the Bible, and children.
[02:35:15.524 --> 02:35:17.005]  No child left behind.
[02:35:17.005 --> 02:35:18.306]  No child left behind.
[02:35:18.306 --> 02:35:19.307]  Oh, really?
[02:35:19.307 --> 02:35:22.229]  Well, it wasn't long ago you were talking about giving kids a head start.
[02:35:22.229 --> 02:35:22.890]  Head start?
[02:35:22.890 --> 02:35:23.811]  Left behind?
[02:35:23.811 --> 02:35:25.252]  Someone's losing ground here.
[02:35:27.159 --> 02:35:27.980]  But there's a reason.
[02:35:27.980 --> 02:35:28.901]  There's a reason.
[02:35:28.901 --> 02:35:30.202]  There's a reason for this.
[02:35:30.202 --> 02:35:32.163]  There's a reason education sucks.
[02:35:32.163 --> 02:35:36.167]  And it's the same reason that it will never, ever, ever be fixed.
[02:35:36.167 --> 02:35:37.688]  It's never going to get any better.
[02:35:37.688 --> 02:35:38.829]  Don't look for it.
[02:35:38.829 --> 02:35:40.430]  Be happy with what you got.
[02:35:40.430 --> 02:35:44.053]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[02:35:44.053 --> 02:35:46.035]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[02:35:46.035 --> 02:35:47.957]  The big, the wealthy.
[02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:55.960]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:57.302]  Forget the politicians.
[02:35:57.302 --> 02:35:59.085]  They're irrelevant.
[02:35:59.085 --> 02:36:03.011]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[02:36:03.011 --> 02:36:03.412]  You don't.
[02:36:04.221 --> 02:36:05.582]  You have no choice.
[02:36:05.582 --> 02:36:06.822]  You have owners.
[02:36:06.822 --> 02:36:08.363]  They own you.
[02:36:08.363 --> 02:36:09.883]  They own everything.
[02:36:09.883 --> 02:36:11.904]  They own all the important land.
[02:36:11.904 --> 02:36:13.685]  They own and control the corporations.
[02:36:13.685 --> 02:36:17.187]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[02:36:17.187 --> 02:36:19.187]  They've got the judges in their back pockets.
[02:36:19.187 --> 02:36:20.988]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:20.988 --> 02:36:26.831]  A couple times a year this happens, where we have a problem with the connection to the network up in Minnesota.
[02:36:26.831 --> 02:36:29.752]  But on here, I know we've got loaded phones and a few of the news stories I want to
[02:36:30.256 --> 02:36:30.636]  Get on.
[02:36:30.636 --> 02:36:34.578]  This has got to be a day before I leave for a couple days on vacation.
[02:36:34.578 --> 02:36:36.038]  Visit family.
[02:36:36.038 --> 02:36:41.241]  Always have a fun show right before I leave town, so I apologize to everybody out there.
[02:36:41.241 --> 02:36:58.888]  But a caller, before I get interrupted by the lines continuing to crud out, the caller was asking me, you know, how you tell disinformation.
[02:37:01.365 --> 02:37:03.266]  And it's really pretty easy to do.
[02:37:03.266 --> 02:37:09.267]  I mean, when you, for years, have websites and groups that all they do is attack everyone else.
[02:37:09.267 --> 02:37:11.608]  And they'll always talk about how they're persecuted, though.
[02:37:11.608 --> 02:37:16.350]  That's always an important part of them.
[02:37:16.350 --> 02:37:22.912]  They will attack and lie and just make stuff up or take half-truths and then expand on it and build on it and twist it.
[02:37:22.912 --> 02:37:25.873]  And they do it and they do it and they do it and they do it.
[02:37:25.873 --> 02:37:27.133]  And you've got those types.
[02:37:27.133 --> 02:37:30.574]  But very few of those are actually COINTELPRO government operations, even though there's
[02:37:31.121 --> 02:37:36.886]  Over a billion and a half bucks just, you know, in a two-year period spent, admittedly, on domestic propaganda.
[02:37:36.886 --> 02:37:48.196]  Now they admit the Pentagon and all these other corporations and government together are buying all these bloggers and doing all this stuff out there to put out background chatter and noise and disinfo.
[02:37:48.196 --> 02:37:58.845]  And then you got other people who get on the web and the internet and radio and they find that they just come up with cockamamie stories, shocking things, that they'll get attention.
[02:37:59.881 --> 02:38:12.564]  And then, of course, they get attention a couple times, but they cry wolf, and people figure out that they're... Doesn't matter if they're a government agent, or they're disinfo, or they're just publicity whores, or whatever they are, people know they're a fraud.
[02:38:12.564 --> 02:38:19.366]  So you've got, uh... You've got those types out there.
[02:38:19.366 --> 02:38:23.307]  And, you know, I don't know who all these people are.
[02:38:23.307 --> 02:38:24.827]  I don't know for sure who they are.
[02:38:24.827 --> 02:38:26.888]  Some of them we've found out, some of them we've discovered.
[02:38:29.097 --> 02:38:35.921]  I mean, you know, uh, there have been people I've had on this show over and over again.
[02:38:35.921 --> 02:38:50.069]  You know, one of them, a big peak oil pusher, and then he said, oh, forget about 9-11, it's a dead issue, and then, oh, we need to reduce the world population, and pretty much I didn't have to attack that person, even though I knew they were a total shill, because I knew they'd self-destruct on their own.
[02:38:50.069 --> 02:38:52.371]  People have gotten a discernment for this.
[02:38:53.968 --> 02:39:04.597]  And so folks want me to sit up here and debunk everybody, and be the good shepherd, and tell everybody what's good, and tell everybody what's bad, and I don't do that.
[02:39:04.597 --> 02:39:14.866]  The reason for all my problems, and my delivery and everything, and I make mistakes too, that I have ten times the listeners.
[02:39:14.866 --> 02:39:17.528]  On the internet alone, just on the internet, listener-wise.
[02:39:18.087 --> 02:39:21.489]  Of any other patriot or truth talk show in the country.
[02:39:21.489 --> 02:39:27.333]  As George Norley said without prompting, I have the biggest unrated, unmainstreamed show in the country.
[02:39:27.333 --> 02:39:28.313]  He knows that.
[02:39:28.313 --> 02:39:30.154]  And we do have stations that are getting ratings.
[02:39:30.154 --> 02:39:32.796]  Ted Anderson actually gets the Arbitron book.
[02:39:32.796 --> 02:39:42.382]  But it's like a paltry 280,000 every 15 minutes or something, and that's just from a few stations that we have that actually get the Arbitron.
[02:39:42.382 --> 02:39:45.083]  But you go over three hours, it's over two million people.
[02:39:45.083 --> 02:39:45.964]  That's rated.
[02:39:46.408 --> 02:39:50.171]  Just on AM and FM stations.
[02:39:50.171 --> 02:39:59.399]  But on the Internet, we have over 5,000 simultaneous listeners at any one time.
[02:39:59.399 --> 02:40:09.168]  The biggest other so-called Patriot show, even on this network, and those shows dwarf the other networks, are 500, 600.
[02:40:12.199 --> 02:40:13.720]  You know why people listen to this show?
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:15.742]  Because they know I'm pure of heart.
[02:40:15.742 --> 02:40:18.724]  Man, I'm the real thing.
[02:40:18.724 --> 02:40:20.525]  I mean, I get up here and talk bad about myself.
[02:40:20.525 --> 02:40:23.207]  I get up here and talk about things I don't like.
[02:40:23.207 --> 02:40:24.348]  I mean, that's the way I am.
[02:40:24.348 --> 02:40:25.689]  That's who I am.
[02:40:25.689 --> 02:40:29.912]  I mean, I get up here on air and go, man, I don't like some of the sponsors that are on here with me.
[02:40:29.912 --> 02:40:34.655]  I never really liked Dr. Dean O'Dell, but my respect for him went way up to the day when I heard him attack his own sponsor.
[02:40:35.382 --> 02:40:36.882]  This is embarrassing to him.
[02:40:36.882 --> 02:40:42.883]  He doesn't believe in some of the get well quick magic cure stuff and he doesn't like it.
[02:40:42.883 --> 02:40:46.464]  Now, I tend to disagree with him that vitamins aren't good and they're in real stuff out there.
[02:40:46.464 --> 02:40:47.404]  Don't get me wrong.
[02:40:47.404 --> 02:40:48.564]  But I mean, I respect it.
[02:40:48.564 --> 02:40:53.865]  First time I ever heard somebody other than myself go, man, I don't like that advertising.
[02:40:53.865 --> 02:40:58.886]  You know, that's because, I mean, I have to feel good about myself.
[02:40:58.886 --> 02:41:00.787]  I mean, I am a good guy.
[02:41:00.787 --> 02:41:01.967]  I try to be a good person.
[02:41:01.967 --> 02:41:02.767]  I have a conscience.
[02:41:06.423 --> 02:41:08.545]  And that's why I do what I do!
[02:41:08.545 --> 02:41:10.187]  That's why I stay and make copies of my videos.
[02:41:10.187 --> 02:41:14.551]  That's why I make a $100,000 film and spend most of the money I got making Terror Storm.
[02:41:14.551 --> 02:41:17.433]  And then I put it out for free on Google Video and just ask you to give it to people.
[02:41:17.433 --> 02:41:19.335]  I just want to fight the corruption.
[02:41:19.335 --> 02:41:20.556]  I just want to bring them to justice.
[02:41:20.556 --> 02:41:22.238]  That's what I'm into.
[02:41:22.238 --> 02:41:23.179]  That's what floats my boat.
[02:41:27.014 --> 02:41:29.956]  But I get embarrassed by this movement.
[02:41:29.956 --> 02:41:31.296]  Not by you, the listeners.
[02:41:31.296 --> 02:41:34.938]  Wonderful, fabulous, caring, compassionate.
[02:41:34.938 --> 02:41:40.241]  That's why I don't want you calling up, thanking me, and telling me how great I am, because I think you're great.
[02:41:40.241 --> 02:41:41.262]  I'm just doing my job.
[02:41:41.262 --> 02:41:43.003]  I feel like I don't do a good enough job.
[02:41:43.003 --> 02:41:45.124]  And I don't deliver the information good enough.
[02:41:45.124 --> 02:41:49.386]  And I don't do enough research, even though I try.
[02:41:49.386 --> 02:41:50.267]  You know, that's the thing.
[02:41:51.716 --> 02:41:57.398]  Growing up, I'd always share my jelly beans or, you know, I'd always, you know, give my jacket to another little kid.
[02:41:57.398 --> 02:41:59.379]  I mean, I am a sharing good person.
[02:41:59.379 --> 02:42:03.580]  Everybody who knows me knows that.
[02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:14.404]  And, uh, you know, I grew up in Dallas, in an upper middle class neighborhood where up the hill where the really big houses were, there were a bunch of rich preachers.
[02:42:16.232 --> 02:42:25.260]  And growing up, I knew their children, you know, they were all in rock bands, they did drugs, you know, I was a straight arrow compared to them.
[02:42:25.260 --> 02:42:30.024]  They would laugh about how they were scamming people, it was all a big joke.
[02:42:30.024 --> 02:42:34.848]  And, I mean, I grew up around these people.
[02:42:34.848 --> 02:42:37.030]  Famous preachers, folks.
[02:42:37.030 --> 02:42:39.332]  Famous people.
[02:42:39.332 --> 02:42:41.254]  Dallas, Rockwall, the main nest of them.
[02:42:42.406 --> 02:42:47.728]  And so growing up, then I got into the Patriot Movement, and there's a lot of good people in this movement.
[02:42:47.728 --> 02:43:03.896]  But you've never heard me until about a month ago, and I said, well, hell, if there's going to be all these people who I know are shysters, constantly squeezing people, I might as well tell you, listeners, hey, if you give me donations, I will spend it.
[02:43:03.896 --> 02:43:07.598]  I will use it to fight the new world order.
[02:43:07.598 --> 02:43:10.759]  I can't believe the type of stuff I've seen go on.
[02:43:13.266 --> 02:43:15.426]  I can't believe it.
[02:43:15.426 --> 02:43:18.227]  Genesis doesn't do that, folks.
[02:43:18.227 --> 02:43:24.548]  And I see it go on in other quarters, and it's embarrassing.
[02:43:24.548 --> 02:43:27.309]  I mean, it's embarrassing me.
[02:43:27.309 --> 02:43:29.549]  I don't like it.
[02:43:29.549 --> 02:43:34.170]  It doesn't make me feel good when I lay my head down at night.
[02:43:34.170 --> 02:43:37.031]  But then I have to balance all of this.
[02:43:37.031 --> 02:43:37.991]  You know, so I say to myself,
[02:43:40.925 --> 02:43:43.467]  I say to myself, I mean, that's how I got off into that yesterday.
[02:43:43.467 --> 02:43:45.909]  I was talking about several issues.
[02:43:45.909 --> 02:43:51.053]  Several different people, several different groups, several different things I've witnessed.
[02:43:51.053 --> 02:43:54.095]  You ought to see them, they all call, kicking and screaming, thinking I'm talking about them.
[02:43:54.095 --> 02:43:59.339]  I'm talking about the whole thing.
[02:43:59.339 --> 02:44:07.666]  And... So all I've ever told you listeners is, yes, the government, the media, it's corrupt, it's full of good, the bad, and the ugly.
[02:44:07.666 --> 02:44:10.748]  And the same thing with the Truth Movement, or the Patriot Movement,
[02:44:11.112 --> 02:44:13.673]  Whatever you want to call it.
[02:44:13.673 --> 02:44:26.177]  Just because you're looking for something different, and just because you're out there looking for the alternative, doesn't mean that everything that claims it's an alternative is necessarily good.
[02:44:26.177 --> 02:44:32.579]  That's why I say never believe what I say, don't see me as your leader, go check this out for yourself.
[02:44:32.579 --> 02:44:33.119]  And you do.
[02:44:33.119 --> 02:44:37.500]  Many of you go check out what I say and you find out many times it's worse than what I've actually said.
[02:44:37.500 --> 02:44:39.041]  Because you find stuff I didn't know about.
[02:44:39.628 --> 02:44:41.989]  You find what I said, then you find more.
[02:44:41.989 --> 02:44:43.330]  And then that's who we listen to.
[02:44:43.330 --> 02:44:46.052]  Your emails, your letters, your calls, the guests we bring on.
[02:44:46.052 --> 02:44:47.333]  We're all, this is a college.
[02:44:47.333 --> 02:44:49.194]  We're like always in school.
[02:44:49.194 --> 02:44:54.417]  I'm trying to learn more every day.
[02:44:54.417 --> 02:44:56.238]  And, I weigh this.
[02:44:56.238 --> 02:44:59.040]  You know, people want me to, well, what about this person?
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:00.160]  Well, what about that person?
[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:01.081]  Well, is this person good?
[02:45:01.081 --> 02:45:02.242]  Is that person good?
[02:45:02.242 --> 02:45:03.482]  And a lot of times we don't know.
[02:45:03.482 --> 02:45:08.886]  You know, I have some former big Bush administration official on.
[02:45:08.886 --> 02:45:09.046]  And,
[02:45:10.359 --> 02:45:15.403]  They act normal and put out good info, and then a year later they just totally start saying kooky stuff?
[02:45:15.403 --> 02:45:18.105]  I mean, it's pretty clear what that is.
[02:45:18.105 --> 02:45:25.792]  You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that that's thoroughbred disinfo.
[02:45:25.792 --> 02:45:29.174]  And that's directly from the source.
[02:45:29.174 --> 02:45:30.716]  But then most of it's just ego.
[02:45:30.716 --> 02:45:35.239]  That's what really depresses me, is that most of these people aren't agents or whatever, they're just grifters.
[02:45:39.461 --> 02:45:46.723]  And I was trying, the last time I was thinking about going on air and exposing all this and I thought, my God, I'm going to have to like write a book.
[02:45:46.723 --> 02:45:49.103]  I mean, I'll have to write hundreds of pages.
[02:45:49.103 --> 02:45:56.345]  I mean, so many witnesses and employees and, and in just all of it, so many things.
[02:45:56.345 --> 02:45:59.185]  If I was going to do this, I'd have to do it right.
[02:45:59.185 --> 02:46:01.226]  It's kind of like when I say, well, I'm going to talk about 9-11.
[02:46:01.226 --> 02:46:03.366]  I want to spend a couple hours on it and really go through some evidence.
[02:46:08.891 --> 02:46:17.898]  Which is kind of good I got sick and felt bad and was irritable, because I've been needing to expose this, but because I didn't want to get involved in all of it, I didn't.
[02:46:17.898 --> 02:46:21.742]  But then, when you get threatened repeatedly, you have to.
[02:46:21.742 --> 02:46:27.186]  It's just a matter of course to do it.
[02:46:27.186 --> 02:46:33.011]  You know, that's how I've lived my life, standing up to bullets.
[02:46:33.011 --> 02:46:37.154]  And, it is depressing.
[02:46:37.154 --> 02:46:37.775]  Yesterday,
[02:46:39.306 --> 02:46:43.588]  I was on air and then somebody called in, and you know I was just saying, you know what, you ought to just support us.
[02:46:43.588 --> 02:46:51.232]  You ought to buy a bunch of our videos and books, which I haven't plugged yet today, to support this outreach, what we're doing, just to help us get the word out.
[02:46:51.232 --> 02:46:52.973]  You need to.
[02:46:52.973 --> 02:46:57.375]  And then I went off into, you know, my gosh, because there's these old ladies that get ripped off.
[02:46:57.375 --> 02:47:04.078]  I mean, I know these old ladies here locally, who quote, loaned the money and are told it's gone.
[02:47:04.078 --> 02:47:07.460]  You know, I mean, this is, you know, I mean, I know what's going on here locally.
[02:47:09.641 --> 02:47:17.284]  I mean, I've heard it on the radio, talk show hosts saying, you know, give me your inheritance, give me your money when you die.
[02:47:17.284 --> 02:47:18.825]  I mean, that's embarrassing.
[02:47:18.825 --> 02:47:22.506]  And I mean, I have people every week come up to me and think that I'm on that other network.
[02:47:22.506 --> 02:47:25.347]  That's the torture part.
[02:47:25.347 --> 02:47:29.309]  And the individual knows full well that people can't differentiate.
[02:47:29.309 --> 02:47:37.232]  The individual knows full well that, you know, that collections are made on my back, on my name, on who I am, when I'm not even asking for donations.
[02:47:38.010 --> 02:47:42.273]  And people can't tell the difference what's on these local stations, these local micro-FMs.
[02:47:42.273 --> 02:47:42.993]  They can't tell!
[02:47:42.993 --> 02:47:43.594]  They don't know!
[02:47:43.594 --> 02:47:49.157]  And it's intentionally made where it's not clear.
[02:47:49.157 --> 02:47:52.039]  And so not in my name!
[02:47:52.039 --> 02:47:56.022]  Not in my name!
[02:47:56.022 --> 02:48:06.149]  And then you just, you know, out of disgust, you make a slight comment that only that individual would know about.
[02:48:06.149 --> 02:48:06.629]  And they
[02:48:07.398 --> 02:48:18.926]  Concoct a lie that is so laughable that literally had people rolling in my office and I said, that's not funny.
[02:48:18.926 --> 02:48:26.992]  You know, and then add some credibility to it, you know, some mindless salve of, oh, I've had an investigator.
[02:48:26.992 --> 02:48:30.595]  I mean, totally made up.
[02:48:30.595 --> 02:48:32.036]  There's no investigator.
[02:48:32.036 --> 02:48:33.537]  There's no finding.
[02:48:33.537 --> 02:48:34.037]  Show it.
[02:48:34.037 --> 02:48:34.698]  Bring it out now.
[02:48:35.509 --> 02:48:43.651]  By the way, I need listeners that heard that and what their interpretation was to send me, go write up your letter, have it notarized, and send it to me.
[02:48:43.651 --> 02:48:50.313]  That's important, important evidence.
[02:48:50.313 --> 02:48:52.514]  And I mean, so, that's the type of stuff!
[02:48:52.514 --> 02:48:56.835]  And then what made me even sicker, I was gonna ignore it, even after the threats and the rest of it.
[02:48:56.835 --> 02:49:04.337]  I was gonna ignore it until other locals, one in particular, well, you know, Alex, he, uh,
[02:49:05.083 --> 02:49:10.005]  You know, Alex needs to just not start stuff.
[02:49:10.005 --> 02:49:13.866]  You know, I never talked about it until I found out it happened to a bunch of other people, because it was so weird.
[02:49:13.866 --> 02:49:20.368]  One time I was at this person's house, and this person, just out of the blue, was pointing a gun at me.
[02:49:20.368 --> 02:49:23.329]  And then, and I got up and said, don't ever do that again.
[02:49:23.329 --> 02:49:26.330]  And then I really never came around them again.
[02:49:26.330 --> 02:49:29.731]  And then I find out they're attacking me all the time, on air, off air.
[02:49:29.731 --> 02:49:31.472]  And I go, hey, you better quit that or I'm gonna expose you.
[02:49:31.472 --> 02:49:32.312]  Okay, we'll have a truce.
[02:49:32.731 --> 02:49:34.793]  Constantly lying behind the scenes.
[02:49:34.793 --> 02:49:35.393]  Constantly.
[02:49:35.393 --> 02:49:40.376]  And then I found out at meetings at his office, he pulls the gun out and puts it on the table, just in the middle of nowhere.
[02:49:40.376 --> 02:49:44.419]  And then I found out about people that use drugs with him.
[02:49:44.419 --> 02:49:46.881]  And then delivery of hardcore stuff was made.
[02:49:46.881 --> 02:49:49.603]  I mean, folks, I've been on air.
[02:49:49.603 --> 02:49:53.786]  I told you I haven't smoked pot since I was like 17 years old, and I never liked it.
[02:49:53.786 --> 02:49:58.509]  I'm straight as it goes, but I'll drink a Budweiser occasionally.
[02:49:58.509 --> 02:50:00.611]  And I mean, to have someone get on air
[02:50:01.391 --> 02:50:04.573]  And say things about me that they themselves are doing.
[02:50:04.573 --> 02:50:05.754]  I mean, I have eyewitnesses.
[02:50:05.754 --> 02:50:07.095]  I have employees.
[02:50:07.095 --> 02:50:08.296]  I have all the people.
[02:50:08.296 --> 02:50:12.058]  People's wives with big black shiners.
[02:50:12.058 --> 02:50:15.000]  Calling Jack Blood's son a bastard.
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:16.261]  A little baby.
[02:50:16.261 --> 02:50:20.324]  When he's not, he lives with his child with his wife.
[02:50:20.324 --> 02:50:22.425]  I mean, just every evil you can imagine.
[02:50:22.425 --> 02:50:28.449]  And then the weird people who are in this movement around here think all that's normal.
[02:50:29.534 --> 02:50:33.337]  They think all that's good!
[02:50:33.337 --> 02:50:38.681]  So, somebody has called me before and threatened me and they've done it on air and all their stuff, that's it.
[02:50:38.681 --> 02:50:55.433]  I was already going on vacation for a few days, and while I'm on vacation I'm going to write a big article, you can be absolutely assured, and just anyone in Austin, Texas who supports the carpetbagger that moved down here to attach himself to me, and it's immoral.
[02:50:55.433 --> 02:50:57.855]  I don't like to wake people up.
[02:50:58.815 --> 02:51:03.297]  And then know that I'm not here trying to get volunteers or money or asking for anything.
[02:51:03.297 --> 02:51:06.098]  And to know that they all go towards that light.
[02:51:06.098 --> 02:51:09.900]  That bug zapper in the sky.
[02:51:09.900 --> 02:51:11.381]  And so, that's it.
[02:51:11.381 --> 02:51:12.682]  I am going to litigate.
[02:51:12.682 --> 02:51:14.102]  Guaranteed.
[02:51:14.102 --> 02:51:14.943]  Promised.
[02:51:14.943 --> 02:51:16.804]  And I'm going to expose.
[02:51:16.804 --> 02:51:21.346]  You slandered and libeled the wrong person, buddy.
[02:51:21.346 --> 02:51:22.766]  You're going down for what you've done.
[02:51:22.766 --> 02:51:23.947]  I'm going to expose every bit of it.
[02:51:28.372 --> 02:51:33.253]  It's here.
[02:51:33.253 --> 02:51:38.395]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:38.395 --> 02:51:46.038]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:46.730 --> 02:51:54.173]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:54.173 --> 02:52:05.917]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:05.917 --> 02:52:09.878]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:09.878 --> 02:52:12.139]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:12.139 --> 02:52:15.920]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:54:43.503 --> 02:55:11.558]  Yeah, when I'm back next week, I am going to need listeners who heard that stuff here locally on that talk station to actually come into my lawyer's office here at TAV and do sworn depositions.
[02:55:11.558 --> 02:55:12.659]  It'll be even more effective.
[02:55:13.337 --> 02:55:16.099]  I was just going to give out his address.
[02:55:16.099 --> 02:55:19.562]  And I may use Gibbons too.
[02:55:19.562 --> 02:55:23.105]  And I'm going to have to, it's going to be something instant, man, in court.
[02:55:23.105 --> 02:55:26.508]  Okay, you said you had, you hired a PI, boom, didn't.
[02:55:26.508 --> 02:55:28.990]  You say he does this, show it.
[02:55:28.990 --> 02:55:31.212]  It's like saying I flew to the moon, folks.
[02:55:31.212 --> 02:55:33.234]  Totally made up.
[02:55:33.234 --> 02:55:36.156]  Totally, just out of the blue, just making up lies.
[02:55:36.156 --> 02:55:40.420]  When I literally, it's like a, it's like a mausoleum.
[02:55:41.013 --> 02:55:44.454]  The size of a shopping mall full of skeletons.
[02:55:44.454 --> 02:55:47.635]  I mean, you talk about throwing rocks in glass houses.
[02:55:47.635 --> 02:55:51.396]  I live in a... brick outhouse, folks.
[02:55:51.396 --> 02:55:53.157]  I mean, just no windows.
[02:55:53.157 --> 02:55:56.978]  No glass.
[02:55:56.978 --> 02:55:58.858]  Over the years, I don't throw stones at anybody.
[02:55:58.858 --> 02:56:04.420]  And I sit here, and I take the on-air stuff, the sneaking around, the back-stepping the line.
[02:56:04.420 --> 02:56:08.361]  Hell, this person's the one that put out the lie seven years ago.
[02:56:08.928 --> 02:56:12.189]  He gets on air and says, we're even digging out that tape.
[02:56:12.189 --> 02:56:17.390]  Yeah, I talked to 2020 and they're sending me a copy of the check he got to betray these people.
[02:56:17.390 --> 02:56:18.670]  Totally made up.
[02:56:18.670 --> 02:56:22.571]  Total lie.
[02:56:22.571 --> 02:56:23.432]  And I'm a schmuck.
[02:56:23.432 --> 02:56:26.412]  I put up with that and went along with that.
[02:56:26.412 --> 02:56:29.553]  And I'm not taking abuse anymore.
[02:56:29.553 --> 02:56:30.993]  No more.
[02:56:30.993 --> 02:56:33.374]  You're not ruining my vacation either.
[02:56:33.374 --> 02:56:33.654]  Almost.
[02:56:34.831 --> 02:56:36.153]  Because it's hard with lawyers.
[02:56:36.153 --> 02:56:40.219]  Man, I gotta spend money, I gotta go do depositions.
[02:56:40.219 --> 02:56:48.532]  I've actually hired PIs on John Villarreal in the city, and baby, when I see somebody stealing money, John Villarreal is in the state pen right now in Huntsville, Texas.
[02:56:49.372 --> 02:56:50.993]  Remember when I said all that a year ago?
[02:56:50.993 --> 02:56:54.455]  And he got in my face, he threatened me too.
[02:56:54.455 --> 02:56:56.036]  He said, he said, you're going to get it for this.
[02:56:56.036 --> 02:57:00.259]  And I said, listen to me, you little Mexican gangster, you're the one that's going to get it.
[02:57:00.259 --> 02:57:01.760]  And he's in prison right now.
[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:04.822]  He made the mistake of threatening me, and we're going to get the rest of them too.
[02:57:04.822 --> 02:57:06.323]  They're very close to being indicted.
[02:57:06.323 --> 02:57:11.446]  I had this big old guy with a board member get in my face and tell me I was going down.
[02:57:11.446 --> 02:57:14.388]  And I poked him right back in the chest and I said, you're going down.
[02:57:15.990 --> 02:57:16.971]  So that's it!
[02:57:16.971 --> 02:57:19.192]  Ball is kicked off, baby!
[02:57:19.192 --> 02:57:21.734]  And I'm going full bore.
[02:57:21.734 --> 02:57:22.974]  Period.
[02:57:22.974 --> 02:57:27.097]  And I'm gonna get depositions from everybody who's seen them using drugs.
[02:57:27.097 --> 02:57:32.921]  Imagine that in court with that jury, accusing me of something I've never done since I was in high school.
[02:57:32.921 --> 02:57:37.804]  I'm as straight arrow as it gets.
[02:57:37.804 --> 02:57:39.605]  Getting on air and saying that about me,
[02:57:42.290 --> 02:57:48.573]  See, we got all these people on record who heard it, not just the tape, but them calling me, asking me if it was true.
[02:57:48.573 --> 02:57:51.234]  That is deliberate malice of forethought.
[02:57:51.234 --> 02:57:57.217]  And the whole institution, the people that run it, they're the ones I'm going to sue.
[02:57:57.217 --> 02:57:58.697]  And any outlets I'm going to sue.
[02:57:58.697 --> 02:58:00.358]  Just watch!
[02:58:00.358 --> 02:58:01.138]  Just watch.
[02:58:01.138 --> 02:58:02.839]  Guaranteed.
[02:58:02.839 --> 02:58:04.480]  You can guarantee it.
[02:58:04.480 --> 02:58:05.560]  I promise you.
[02:58:05.560 --> 02:58:06.881]  That's it.
[02:58:06.881 --> 02:58:09.422]  And I'm going to do more.
[02:58:09.422 --> 02:58:11.223]  I'm going to expose
[02:58:11.741 --> 02:58:13.802]  Everything.
[02:58:13.802 --> 02:58:15.483]  Everything.
[02:58:15.483 --> 02:58:17.324]  People that had guns pointed at them.
[02:58:17.324 --> 02:58:21.646]  Like, psychopathically, you just look up, the person's pointing a gun, trying to menace you, getting off on it.
[02:58:21.646 --> 02:58:23.027]  Pure evil, folks.
[02:58:23.027 --> 02:58:26.008]  Deserved to be exposed before, will be exposed.
[02:58:26.008 --> 02:58:32.292]  I'm talking about the carpetbagger that came down here to Austin, that tries to act like he runs everything, confuses people.
[02:58:32.292 --> 02:58:34.193]  You don't ever threaten me.
[02:58:34.193 --> 02:58:36.654]  I told you once, and now you're gonna find out.
[02:58:37.651 --> 02:58:39.632]  How dare you, you liar!
[02:58:39.632 --> 02:58:43.954]  And all the pumps that think your lie is okay!
[02:58:43.954 --> 02:58:46.115]  I'm going after you too.
[02:58:46.115 --> 02:58:48.376]  So you just get ready.
[02:58:48.376 --> 02:58:50.557]  And I need my listeners to help me with this.
[02:58:50.557 --> 02:58:51.597]  This is going to be serious.
[02:58:51.597 --> 02:58:53.818]  I'm trying to make a North American Union film.
[02:58:53.818 --> 02:58:55.039]  I'm trying to do all these interviews.
[02:58:55.039 --> 02:58:56.219]  I'm trying to fight the New World Order.
[02:58:56.219 --> 02:58:56.819]  But you know what?
[02:58:56.819 --> 02:58:58.680]  You've got to do the right thing.
[02:58:58.680 --> 02:59:01.081]  And I'm going to clean out a nest of maggots.
[02:59:01.081 --> 02:59:02.762]  You go ahead and make your excuses.
[02:59:02.762 --> 02:59:04.022]  You'll see who wins.
[02:59:04.022 --> 02:59:05.323]  I've got God on my side.
[02:59:09.108 --> 02:59:13.777]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[02:59:19.662 --> 02:59:25.025]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:59:25.025 --> 02:59:33.371]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:59:33.371 --> 02:59:40.435]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:59:40.555 --> 02:59:40.976]  We're good.
