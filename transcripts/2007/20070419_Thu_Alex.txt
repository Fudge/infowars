[00:00:04.374 --> 00:00:05.014]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:06.716]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.437 --> 00:00:08.538]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:10.020]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:11.702]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:16.027]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:20.592]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:25.070]  And... Aloha, America!
[00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.111]  This is not Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:28.211]  This is Mike Rivera.
[00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:29.071]  I'm guest hosting.
[00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:34.793]  Alex is out doing what Alex does all too well, which is tracking down the crimes and corruptions of the New World Order.
[00:00:35.594 --> 00:00:38.575]  And he's asked me to step in and fill in just a little bit today.
[00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:39.935]  So, welcome to the show.
[00:00:41.256 --> 00:00:43.156]  Today is April 19th.
[00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.757]  April 19th, a very portentous date.
[00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:47.378]  It's Patriots Day!
[00:00:47.398 --> 00:00:50.639]  This is the anniversary of the Battle of Lexington and Concord.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.180]  Triggered when the British attempted to disarm the Colonials in 1775.
[00:00:54.921 --> 00:01:02.802]  This resulted in a running gun battle and the shot heard around the world and the start of the American War for Independence.
[00:01:03.222 --> 00:01:09.503]  And to put this in its historical context in line with some of the other things we're going to be talking about later in the show.
[00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:17.604]  In 1775, this country had a government that was engaged in foreign wars that were costing a lot of money.
[00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:20.665]  They were taxing the people of America
[00:01:21.536 --> 00:01:24.777]  With very heavy taxes to go fight these wars.
[00:01:25.297 --> 00:01:28.257]  The American people were saying no, the government was not listening.
[00:01:28.918 --> 00:01:39.060]  So the government got it into their heads that if they took away the arms of the American Colonials, that the Americans would not have the ability to say no anymore to these taxes.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.841]  So the British went out, tried to grab the guns, a battle broke out and the war was underway.
[00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:53.411]  April 19th is also the anniversary of the end of the siege at Waco, Texas in the Branch Davidian compound, essentially a church.
[00:01:54.632 --> 00:02:12.047]  That siege started when the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, desperate for favorable publicity following some severe embarrassments like kicking down the wrong doors and shooting innocent homeowners during no-knock raids, wanted to go in and grab the guns from the Branch Davidians.
[00:02:12.492 --> 00:02:18.693]  Who were basically buying old guns, repairing them, and selling them at gun shows in order to raise money for their religious activities.
[00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:26.355]  The siege got completely out of control and ended on this date in 1993 when the compound burned down.
[00:02:26.395 --> 00:02:31.697]  There's still a lot of controversy over exactly how that all came about.
[00:02:32.537 --> 00:02:36.258]  And of course, it's also the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:02:36.278 --> 00:02:39.398]  A lot of controversy surrounding that one.
[00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:41.959]  Certainly with regard to the second Ryder truck
[00:02:42.492 --> 00:02:47.776]  And the numerous persistent reports of additional explosives inside the building itself.
[00:02:48.017 --> 00:03:00.086]  How very convenient for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms that all of their paperwork from the Waco disaster were in that building when it came down, which brought to an end the looming congressional hearings into that disaster.
[00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:09.314]  And of course, finally, and most germane to the events of this last week, today is the anniversary of the shooting at Columbine, and
[00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:14.171]  Again, it seems to be the hallmark of these mass shootings.
[00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:17.133]  A lot of confusion about how many shooters there were.
[00:03:17.153 --> 00:03:21.635]  A lot of documents sealed away from public scrutiny.
[00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:33.381]  A lot of questions about why this shooting happened just when Colorado was on the verge of passing a concealed carry law for their citizens.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.023]  This event happened exactly when the gun grabbers needed a media event to stop the rush towards concealed carry laws.
[00:03:41.024 --> 00:03:54.972]  So, we're going to be talking today, obviously, about what happened at Virginia Tech and the very shameless, shameless way that we're seeing the gun grabbers exploit this tragedy for their own political ends.
[00:03:56.192 --> 00:04:01.055]  There are a lot of conspiracy theories floating around about what happened at Virginia Tech.
[00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:16.815]  And I think it is a sign of the deterioration of trust in this country by the people in their government, that people are more ready to listen to these conspiracy theories, give them some credence, at least consider them.
[00:04:17.055 --> 00:04:23.577]  But for the purposes of today's discussion, we're going to basically look at the events that happened exactly as they're reported.
[00:04:24.298 --> 00:04:31.200]  This Korean student walks into a dormitory, shoots two people, goes away for a couple of hours while the police run around chasing their tails.
[00:04:31.527 --> 00:04:35.112]  It comes back and shoots a lot more people, and that's all there is to it.
[00:04:35.152 --> 00:04:38.316]  We're going to be looking at that as we come back after this break.
[00:04:38.657 --> 00:04:41.460]  This is Mike Rivero, Substitute Hosting for Alex Jones.
[00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:42.542]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:03.405 --> 00:05:08.809]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:16.834]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:17.532 --> 00:05:24.598]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:24.978 --> 00:05:36.387]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.728 --> 00:05:40.291]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:42.612]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:42.953 --> 00:05:46.796]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:03.412 --> 00:07:06.254]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:07:06.614 --> 00:07:09.336]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:07:09.881 --> 00:07:16.624]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:07:46.657 --> 00:07:50.819]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:52.579]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.635 --> 00:08:18.697]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:18.777 --> 00:08:26.604]  My name is Mike Rivero, and for those of you who haven't caught me in some of the earlier broadcasts, I'm the webmaster of WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:08:26.824 --> 00:08:29.586]  Alex and I have been sharing information for a very, very long time.
[00:08:31.708 --> 00:08:35.731]  Obviously, the top story of this week is the terrible tragedy at Virginia Tech.
[00:08:37.012 --> 00:08:44.098]  And for the purposes of this show, we're not going to go into any of the conspiracy theories that are floating around regarding MKUltra,
[00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:47.794]  Or various other extreme.
[00:08:47.814 --> 00:08:50.677]  We're going to take this incident at face value.
[00:08:50.737 --> 00:08:57.765]  We're going to basically look at this exactly as the mainstream media is presenting it, and then we're going to analyze it for what this really means.
[00:08:57.905 --> 00:09:02.810]  First of all, let's look at the police presence on the campus.
[00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:07.414]  I know one of the constant themes we hear the gun grabbers always saying is the police are here to protect you.
[00:09:07.654 --> 00:09:08.974]  You don't need guns in your home.
[00:09:09.235 --> 00:09:10.595]  The police will take care of you.
[00:09:10.836 --> 00:09:25.924]  Well, we got a good object lesson about that earlier this week when we saw the police on the Virginia Tech campus in their Kevlar armor and carrying their automatic weapons and with their radios and and their helmets and all the fancy toys that the police love to have and stand in front of news cameras for.
[00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:30.207]  But the bottom line is that our shooter went into a dormitory
[00:09:30.652 --> 00:09:40.818]  Killed two people and then walked off to go mail a package apparently to NBC with videotapes and declarations of what he was doing.
[00:09:41.078 --> 00:09:42.979]  Went to buy stamps, wrap a package.
[00:09:43.339 --> 00:09:44.279]  Who knows what all else?
[00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:45.080]  He's not hiding.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.260]  He's just walking around.
[00:09:46.581 --> 00:09:48.802]  The cops could not find him.
[00:09:49.082 --> 00:09:50.223]  Could not track him down.
[00:09:50.983 --> 00:09:52.984]  Didn't bother warning anybody in the campus.
[00:09:53.044 --> 00:09:58.727]  Didn't warn anybody to maybe get out of there and go home where they might be safe.
[00:09:59.328 --> 00:09:59.868]  So our
[00:10:00.498 --> 00:10:07.528]  Perpetrator, Cho Seung-hui, I believe that's how it's pronounced, comes back and starts killing more people.
[00:10:08.129 --> 00:10:12.475]  And the cops don't even confront him at that point.
[00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:15.119]  According to the official report,
[00:10:16.201 --> 00:10:19.663]  The police got to him just as he was committing suicide.
[00:10:20.384 --> 00:10:25.587]  In other words, the presence of the police had zero impact on the events of that day.
[00:10:25.908 --> 00:10:30.591]  So this idea that the police are going to protect you, we can set that one aside right now.
[00:10:32.054 --> 00:10:36.116]  There is no question that the shooter had some serious mental issues.
[00:10:36.456 --> 00:10:38.677]  He had red lights going off all over him.
[00:10:39.257 --> 00:10:52.022]  He was taking antidepressants, and we know that there's been a long history of antidepressants triggering suicidal and violent behavior in certain individuals, and yet we're not seeing anybody screaming to take those antidepressants off the market.
[00:10:53.023 --> 00:11:00.306]  Lots and lots of young people have committed suicide linked to these mind-altering chemicals that are being forced on them by the schools.
[00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:06.708]  Now, the gun grabbers are loving to say that a gun ban would save lives.
[00:11:06.768 --> 00:11:09.989]  This is one of the ones that they're always waving about.
[00:11:10.089 --> 00:11:11.329]  Gun bans will save lives.
[00:11:11.489 --> 00:11:15.450]  But the fact is, there was a gun ban on the campus of Virginia Tech.
[00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:25.232]  Virginia Tech had lobbied against a law that would have allowed teachers and students to carry legally owned firearms on campus for personal protection.
[00:11:25.312 --> 00:11:29.012]  And they did so with the promise that it would make the campus safer.
[00:11:30.033 --> 00:11:31.933]  Obviously, this was a promise that was not
[00:11:34.083 --> 00:11:41.826]  And in light of this, I would like to direct your attention back to another school shooting in 2002 at another Virginia college, the Appalachian Law School.
[00:11:43.147 --> 00:11:51.531]  In this case, the shooter killed three victims before students, using their own legally owned personal firearms, subdued the shooter.
[00:11:52.431 --> 00:11:53.932]  So here's the object lesson.
[00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:56.873]  Gun ban on campus, 33 dead.
[00:11:57.433 --> 00:12:00.935]  Allowing students to carry guns for their own protection, three dead.
[00:12:01.758 --> 00:12:05.480]  Which system is working better to keep the campus safe?
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.623]  33 dead, 3 dead.
[00:12:10.083 --> 00:12:11.804]  Which system works best?
[00:12:12.505 --> 00:12:29.475]  Now how come when a bad person commits a crime that happens to include a gun, the gun grabber's response is not to punish the bad people, or to look at the reasons why they're doing bad things, but to punish the good people by attacking our constitutional right to weapons for self-defense?
[00:12:31.553 --> 00:12:45.700]  Now, I tried to get some guests to come on the show today from gun advocacy groups and all of them basically said they felt it was really way too soon to comment on Virginia Tech.
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:54.664]  They felt it would be basically tasteless and impolite to try and use Virginia Tech for political campaigning.
[00:12:55.638 --> 00:12:59.079]  Unfortunately, the gun grabbers have no sense of decorum.
[00:12:59.099 --> 00:13:08.441]  They're already basically standing, tap-dancing, if you will, on the coffins and waving around the bloody shirts for their political aims and attacking the Second Amendment.
[00:13:10.001 --> 00:13:19.104]  And these people are really being shameless in the way they're exploiting the grief of the families to push their political agenda.
[00:13:20.144 --> 00:13:25.085]  So, it's really shameless to watch here.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:32.584]  Now, there are a couple of, shall we say, swindles going on regarding the gun-grabbing agenda.
[00:13:33.405 --> 00:13:36.567]  The gun-grabbers like to say, if guns are banned, there will be fewer gun crimes.
[00:13:37.367 --> 00:13:39.288]  Well, in a way, this is true.
[00:13:39.449 --> 00:13:40.689]  There will be fewer gun crimes.
[00:13:40.709 --> 00:13:44.912]  There will still be gun crimes, and even the gun-grabbers admit, there will still be some gun crimes.
[00:13:45.352 --> 00:13:52.337]  But what they don't say is that people who are going to commit bad acts simply pick something else.
[00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.392]  They don't have a gun, they'll use a knife.
[00:13:54.412 --> 00:13:55.953]  If they don't have a knife, they'll use a broken bottle.
[00:13:55.973 --> 00:13:58.576]  If they don't have a broken bottle, they'll use a stick.
[00:13:59.137 --> 00:14:03.421]  More people are killed in the United States with baseball bats than with assault rifles.
[00:14:03.781 --> 00:14:07.926]  And yet, you don't see anybody standing up and saying, we must ban all baseball bats.
[00:14:08.546 --> 00:14:15.474]  End to Little League and softball, because they're using a deadly weapon in an otherwise legitimate, benign purpose.
[00:14:17.546 --> 00:14:31.234]  The real hidden issue behind gun control, that the gun grabbers will never mention, is that when citizens are allowed to have guns, crime overall will go down.
[00:14:31.754 --> 00:14:44.581]  If you ban guns, connected crime may go down, but all the other crimes go up, including crimes with knives, broken bottles, baseball bats, so forth and so on.
[00:14:45.002 --> 00:14:47.163]  There has never been a gun ban
[00:14:47.902 --> 00:14:51.805]  Anywhere that lowered overall crime in its wake.
[00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:55.607]  Every one of them, the crimes went up.
[00:14:56.728 --> 00:15:00.590]  Some years ago, Jamaica decided to revitalize their tourism industry.
[00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:04.433]  They had a campaign with these really cool commercials, you know, come back to Jamaica, blah, blah, blah.
[00:15:04.813 --> 00:15:12.518]  And as part of wanting to revamp their image as a tourism friendly destination, they enacted a very strict gun ban.
[00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:16.641]  And as a result, crime, especially crime against tourists,
[00:15:17.253 --> 00:15:19.354]  Exploded through the roof.
[00:15:19.394 --> 00:15:29.196]  There were muggings, there were rapes, there were assaults, burglaries, because the criminals knew they were dealing with a population that could not defend themselves.
[00:15:29.256 --> 00:15:35.398]  They didn't have to wonder, boy, if I try and rob that person, is that person going to pull out a gun and shoot me?
[00:15:35.798 --> 00:15:38.019]  Once that fear is gone, where's the deterrent?
[00:15:38.079 --> 00:15:40.760]  We already know the police aren't going to be there to block the crime.
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.220]  The police show up after the crime is over.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.981]  They'll clean up the mess, they'll look good for the news cameras,
[00:15:46.414 --> 00:15:48.715]  But they're never there when the crime happens.
[00:15:48.795 --> 00:15:51.017]  When the crime happens, there are two people present.
[00:15:51.377 --> 00:15:52.998]  The criminal and the victim.
[00:15:53.358 --> 00:15:55.019]  The criminal is not going to stop the crime.
[00:15:55.359 --> 00:15:58.221]  That leaves only one person, the victim, to stop the crime.
[00:15:58.321 --> 00:16:01.323]  And that is a major, major issue.
[00:16:02.383 --> 00:16:04.585]  Great Britain enacted a gun ban.
[00:16:04.745 --> 00:16:05.745]  Crime there went up.
[00:16:05.926 --> 00:16:08.047]  Home invasions are now very, very common.
[00:16:08.507 --> 00:16:11.609]  The same thing happened in Australia following the Port Arthur massacre.
[00:16:12.065 --> 00:16:17.068]  Which occurred just when the Australian government wanted to impose a gun ban on that country.
[00:16:17.568 --> 00:16:22.271]  And again, crime in the aftermath of that gun ban went up.
[00:16:22.812 --> 00:16:26.994]  More robberies, more rapes, more home invasions, more carjackings.
[00:16:27.775 --> 00:16:40.963]  The University of Chicago conducted a study and found that allowing concealed carry laws lowered crime in every state where concealed carry had been passed and did not increase the murder rate.
[00:16:42.358 --> 00:16:44.679]  And that is really an important fact to keep in mind.
[00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:54.642]  Crime was lowered by concealed carry and there was no corresponding increase in the rate of murder which the gun grabbers kept insisting was going to happen with concealed carry laws.
[00:16:55.882 --> 00:16:56.982]  Ever been to a gun store?
[00:16:57.543 --> 00:17:09.026]  You're not going to meet a more polite, respectful group of people because they all know that nobody can be allowed to get out of control and make a mistake because the consequences
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.842]  are really too dreadful to think about, and that's what deterrence is all about.
[00:17:14.402 --> 00:17:17.744]  We have an American government that believes in the principle of deterrence.
[00:17:17.784 --> 00:17:25.888]  They have nuclear warheads all over the place, but when it comes to the private citizens having deterrence, nope, can't have that at all.
[00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:35.053]  Survey of San Diego police showed most police officers do not view guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens as the problem.
[00:17:35.751 --> 00:17:38.693]  They see guns in the hands of criminals as the problem.
[00:17:38.913 --> 00:17:40.534]  Obviously, we all agree with that.
[00:17:41.255 --> 00:17:46.278]  The guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens did not exaggerate the crime problem.
[00:17:47.559 --> 00:17:49.921]  Now, before we go to break here, one final comment.
[00:17:50.541 --> 00:17:55.545]  Everyone's waving around the death toll about Virginia Tech, but in point of fact there was another school
[00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:59.776]  that had a mass death episode with a larger number.
[00:17:59.836 --> 00:18:05.737]  The highest death toll in a school-related incident was 45 killed in the Bath School Massacre.
[00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:07.597]  And here's one for a shock.
[00:18:07.637 --> 00:18:08.737]  The guy didn't use a gun.
[00:18:08.817 --> 00:18:10.218]  He used explosives.
[00:18:10.718 --> 00:18:14.418]  So when bad people are going to do bad things, it isn't the guns that do it.
[00:18:14.538 --> 00:18:21.420]  It's whatever is available at hand that is going to be used by the bad people doing bad things.
[00:18:26.013 --> 00:18:29.155]  A gun ban... everyone says we can ban all guns.
[00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:30.096]  Of course we can.
[00:18:30.596 --> 00:18:31.597]  There's a ban on heroin.
[00:18:31.617 --> 00:18:32.838]  There's a ban on cocaine.
[00:18:33.319 --> 00:18:37.462]  There's a ban on all kinds of things and yet you can go out onto the streets and still find them.
[00:18:38.262 --> 00:18:44.427]  All a gun ban is going to do is disarm the law-abiding citizens and the law-abiding citizens aren't the problem.
[00:18:46.188 --> 00:18:47.809]  It's the criminals who are the problem.
[00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.711]  And the criminals are always going to have guns.
[00:18:49.731 --> 00:18:52.633]  Can you imagine a cocaine smuggler down in South America
[00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:59.873]  Loading up his airplane with all the cocaine and he's holding a newsie and he says to himself, Boy, I better leave this at home or I could really get into trouble.
[00:19:00.474 --> 00:19:01.494]  It's not going to happen.
[00:19:01.574 --> 00:19:07.477]  He's going to take that gun because with a gun ban, the value of a gun being sold on the streets of America goes up.
[00:19:07.857 --> 00:19:09.718]  It becomes another profit.
[00:19:11.479 --> 00:19:15.240]  Another profit making venture that will make the smuggler even more money.
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.561]  It's another item to smuggle.
[00:19:16.581 --> 00:19:20.523]  It's another item on the black market to be sold for huge amounts of money.
[00:19:24.528 --> 00:19:29.992]  So, a gun ban, even if it was desirable, is not practical.
[00:19:30.472 --> 00:19:33.374]  It's going to disarm the law-abiding citizens only.
[00:19:33.694 --> 00:19:35.155]  We're going to break for a few commercials.
[00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:35.976]  We'll be coming back.
[00:19:36.016 --> 00:19:38.897]  We will take some phone calls in the next segment.
[00:19:39.698 --> 00:19:42.380]  This is Mike Rivera, guest hosting for the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.040]  We'll be right back.

[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:20.721]  We're good to go!

[00:20:49.963 --> 00:20:50.904]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.698 --> 00:21:02.859]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:03.259 --> 00:21:08.741]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:09.302 --> 00:21:09.822]  That's right.
[00:21:10.122 --> 00:21:12.403]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:12.743 --> 00:21:19.907]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:20.453 --> 00:21:28.159]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:28.599 --> 00:21:33.403]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:34.062 --> 00:21:39.086]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:39.887 --> 00:21:44.030]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.671]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:44.711 --> 00:21:46.592]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:46.672 --> 00:21:46.973]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.273 --> 00:21:47.553]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.976 --> 00:22:03.017]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:03.657 --> 00:22:12.581]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:13.021 --> 00:22:20.204]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:20.934 --> 00:22:26.437]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:22:38.504 --> 00:22:40.605]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:22:48.224 --> 00:22:49.266]  We're good.
[00:23:00.001 --> 00:23:03.604]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:23:03.865 --> 00:23:04.725]  Look no further!
[00:23:05.006 --> 00:23:07.588]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:23:08.028 --> 00:23:16.536]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.

[00:23:18.678 --> 00:23:19.279]  We're good to go.
[00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:34.669]  I don't know.
[00:24:00.228 --> 00:24:01.229]  I didn't have to do this.
[00:24:01.969 --> 00:24:03.670]  I could have left.
[00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.752]  I could have fled.
[00:24:05.792 --> 00:24:06.072]  But no.
[00:24:06.092 --> 00:24:08.273]  I will no longer run.
[00:24:08.293 --> 00:24:09.734]  It's not for me.
[00:24:09.754 --> 00:24:11.976]  It's for my children.
[00:24:11.996 --> 00:24:15.218]  For my brothers and sisters that you f***.
[00:24:16.739 --> 00:24:17.479]  I did it for them.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.843]  You had a hundred billion chances and ways to have avoided today, but you decided to spill my blood.
[00:24:24.033 --> 00:24:27.014]  You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option.
[00:24:27.515 --> 00:24:28.615]  The decision was yours.
[00:24:29.355 --> 00:24:31.777]  Now you have blood on your hands that will never wash off.
[00:24:32.057 --> 00:24:33.197]  You sadistic scum.
[00:24:33.677 --> 00:24:39.560]  I may be nothing but a piece of s**t. You have vandalized my heart, raped my soul, and torched my conscience.
[00:24:40.561 --> 00:24:43.042]  You thought it was one pathetic boy's life you were extinguishing.
[00:24:43.062 --> 00:24:49.845]  Thanks to you, I die, like Jesus Christ, to inspire generations of the weak and the defenseless people.
[00:24:50.819 --> 00:24:54.680]  Do you know what it feels like to be spit on your face and have trash shoved down your throat?
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.621]  Do you know what it feels like to dig your own grave?
[00:24:58.381 --> 00:25:01.081]  Do you know what it feels like to have your throat smashed from ear to ear?
[00:25:01.101 --> 00:25:03.902]  Do you know what it feels like to be torched alive?
[00:25:05.022 --> 00:25:11.184]  Do you know what it feels like to be humiliated and be impaled upon on a cross and left to bleed to death for your amusement?
[00:25:12.124 --> 00:25:14.705]  Do you have never felt a single ounce of pain your whole life?
[00:25:15.425 --> 00:25:20.306]  Did you want to inject as much misery in your life as you can just because you can?
[00:25:21.471 --> 00:25:22.611]  You had everything you wanted.
[00:25:23.452 --> 00:25:25.112]  Your Mercedes wasn't enough, you brats.
[00:25:25.693 --> 00:25:27.633]  Your golden necklaces weren't enough, you snobs.
[00:25:28.614 --> 00:25:29.774]  Your trust fund wasn't enough.
[00:25:30.455 --> 00:25:31.995]  Your vodka and cognac weren't enough.
[00:25:32.515 --> 00:25:33.776]  All your devotees weren't enough.
[00:25:33.796 --> 00:25:36.757]  Those weren't enough to fulfill your hedonistic needs.
[00:25:37.737 --> 00:25:38.618]  You had everything.
[00:25:39.158 --> 00:25:40.599]  You just loved crucifying me.
[00:25:41.099 --> 00:25:45.801]  You loved inducing cancer in my head, terrorizing my heart, and ripping my soul all this time.
[00:25:46.101 --> 00:25:47.861]  When the time came, I did it.
[00:25:48.742 --> 00:25:49.082]  I had to.
[00:25:52.498 --> 00:25:59.979]  Okay, well those are the words of Cho Seung-Hui, our perpetrator at Virginia Tech.
[00:26:00.019 --> 00:26:01.840]  We're seeing them all over the air, of course.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:08.681]  And I want to go back real quick to the manner in which the mainstream media is covering this story, which is total saturation.
[00:26:08.701 --> 00:26:12.222]  It's still on the air as I'm watching the TV here in the studio.
[00:26:13.142 --> 00:26:18.143]  And contrast that with the 2002 shooting at the Appalachian School of Law.
[00:26:19.199 --> 00:26:27.721]  Which, by the time it reached the mainstream media, the fact that the shooter was thwarted by fellow students with legally owned firearms had vanished.
[00:26:27.801 --> 00:26:35.443]  And in a lot of places, it was reported the students tackled him, which is still a better performance than the police did at Virginia Tech.
[00:26:36.203 --> 00:26:44.965]  But you really have to search on the internet to find news stories about people who use legally owned firearms to protect themselves from crime.
[00:26:44.985 --> 00:26:48.006]  So I'm just going to read a few of the headlines I found with a Google search.
[00:26:48.699 --> 00:27:16.836]  uh... this morning man shot while trying to break into house police say uh... uh... drive-thru shooting leaves would-be robber dead mobile home intruder met by gunfire robbery victim shoots attacker uh... uh... jeweler gets best of robbers in gunfight gunman shot by store clerks during a campbell robbery uh... man kills burglar police say and so forth and so on and on and on and on the reality is that
[00:27:18.377 --> 00:27:26.364]  More crimes, far more crimes, are halted and stopped by private citizens with legally owned firearms than by the police.
[00:27:27.105 --> 00:27:28.166]  Common sense tells you that.
[00:27:28.406 --> 00:27:31.188]  The police are never there when the crime actually occurs.
[00:27:31.749 --> 00:27:38.875]  They show up afterwards to clean up the mess and say, oh yes, it's a bad thing and we promise we'll get that person who did this to you.
[00:27:39.315 --> 00:27:44.860]  But in terms of actually stopping a crime before it really gets out of hand, that is always being done
[00:27:45.541 --> 00:27:49.022]  Mostly being done by private citizens using legally owned firearms.
[00:27:49.082 --> 00:27:50.603]  It happened on the Appalachian School.
[00:27:51.043 --> 00:27:52.723]  Okay, we've got just a quick minute.
[00:27:52.743 --> 00:27:54.904]  We're going to try and take one phone call before the break.
[00:27:54.944 --> 00:27:55.824]  Red in Colorado.
[00:27:55.864 --> 00:27:56.364]  Red, are you there?
[00:27:57.244 --> 00:27:57.905]  Yeah, hi.
[00:27:58.145 --> 00:28:01.326]  I just got some information that people should understand.
[00:28:01.706 --> 00:28:07.707]  Victims of crime, I think they cause the crime and they're yelled at when they report it.
[00:28:07.728 --> 00:28:08.988]  That's what we're finding out.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.341]  Uh, yeah, I went through that too.
[00:28:12.381 --> 00:28:15.663]  I had to escort a burglar from my home with a legally owned firearm.
[00:28:15.683 --> 00:28:19.926]  And in my case, the police never even bothered to show up to take a report after I phoned it in.
[00:28:20.507 --> 00:28:23.489]  So, uh, a lot of times these things don't get reported.
[00:28:23.809 --> 00:28:24.590]  Thank you for the call.
[00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:26.051]  Let's jump, whoop, yes?
[00:28:27.371 --> 00:28:34.276]  We turned over the evidence to the Department of Defense, the total evidence, and they said it's a crime.
[00:28:34.636 --> 00:28:36.978]  And they said that the FBI is obstructing.
[00:28:37.018 --> 00:28:37.618]  How's that?
[00:28:38.459 --> 00:28:39.720]  This taped evidence we got.
[00:28:41.989 --> 00:28:59.559]  Okay, well, we're just here at the bottom of the break, so we're going to have to break for some commercials, but thank you for calling, and when we get back from the break, we'll get into John and Tony, and then we're going to talk about, you know, what is the real effect of a gun ban?
[00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:07.844]  Certainly in Virginia Tech, all the gun ban did was make sure that nobody was going to be in a position to stop the tragedy that happened earlier this week.
[00:29:08.674 --> 00:29:29.587]  Basically, the gun ban that was supposed to make the campus safe did little more than turn it into a shooting gallery, and I hate to be blunt like that, and I have a tremendous amount of sympathy for the victims, but they were made victims by a misguided policy that assumes that when you take guns away from the law-abiding, that you're going to magically disarm the crazy people and the criminals.
[00:29:29.867 --> 00:29:31.849]  We'll be right back after these words from our sponsor.
[00:29:50.459 --> 00:29:53.464]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.386 --> 00:29:57.070]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.911 --> 00:30:03.633]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[00:30:04.013 --> 00:30:07.015]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[00:30:07.295 --> 00:30:09.356]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?
[00:30:09.677 --> 00:30:14.019]  Now there's SFR Green, performance technologies for a clean planet.
[00:30:14.319 --> 00:30:20.583]  SFR Green's Protector reduces emissions and improves fuel economy, meeting automakers' new standards.
[00:30:20.603 --> 00:30:21.704]  So do something green.
[00:30:21.904 --> 00:30:26.007]  For a special offer with free shipping, go to GreenGasAdditive.com.
[00:30:26.307 --> 00:30:29.429]  Or to locate a retailer, go to GreenGasAdditive.com.
[00:30:31.405 --> 00:30:33.885]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:30:34.346 --> 00:30:36.266]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:30:36.966 --> 00:30:40.167]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:30:40.807 --> 00:30:47.268]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:30:48.048 --> 00:30:50.248]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:30:50.629 --> 00:30:51.069]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:52.549]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:31:01.491 --> 00:31:05.252]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[00:31:05.632 --> 00:31:12.954]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[00:31:13.394 --> 00:31:24.356]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[00:31:24.416 --> 00:31:24.877]  Central.
[00:31:25.237 --> 00:31:30.818]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[00:31:31.178 --> 00:31:37.063]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[00:31:37.563 --> 00:31:42.307]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[00:31:42.687 --> 00:31:47.491]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[00:31:47.931 --> 00:31:49.232]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[00:31:49.292 --> 00:31:49.713]  Central.
[00:31:50.293 --> 00:31:57.719]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[00:32:00.427 --> 00:32:01.268]  Attention gardeners!
[00:32:01.328 --> 00:32:03.690]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:08.253]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[00:32:08.453 --> 00:32:16.339]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:32:16.659 --> 00:32:19.480]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:27.302]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:32:27.382 --> 00:32:33.003]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:32:33.224 --> 00:32:38.785]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:32:39.045 --> 00:32:42.366]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:32:42.606 --> 00:32:45.947]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:32:46.187 --> 00:32:51.229]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:32:51.249 --> 00:32:54.131]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:32:54.151 --> 00:32:54.371]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:33:08.176 --> 00:33:15.561]  Okay, welcome back.
[00:33:15.641 --> 00:33:20.684]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:33:23.847 --> 00:33:26.148]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[00:33:26.709 --> 00:33:28.230]  Someone who cares.
[00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:31.372]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:33:39.535 --> 00:33:47.980]  Okay, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.621]  I'm your guest host, Mike Rivera.
[00:33:49.661 --> 00:33:52.163]  I'm the webmaster of WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:33:53.404 --> 00:33:55.665]  And before we get to the phone calls, I know you're all waiting.
[00:33:55.685 --> 00:33:56.946]  We're going to get to you real quick here.
[00:33:56.966 --> 00:34:00.308]  I just have a couple more comments here about gun bans.
[00:34:00.528 --> 00:34:02.849]  Who benefits from gun bans?
[00:34:02.889 --> 00:34:03.450]  Who likes them?
[00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.390]  Who profits from them?
[00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:05.651]  Well, certainly criminals do.
[00:34:06.178 --> 00:34:08.179]  Criminals love gun bans.
[00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:09.640]  It makes their work safer.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.662]  That is why criminals move to the places that have gun bans.
[00:34:13.702 --> 00:34:17.804]  They move out of the places where citizens are allowed to conceal carry.
[00:34:18.204 --> 00:34:27.889]  And that is why you have studies like the Chicago University study which show that places with concealed carry have a much lower overall crime rate than places that don't.
[00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:33.432]  You have a handgun ban in Washington DC and one of the highest per capita murder rates in the entire country.
[00:34:33.769 --> 00:34:40.432]  You have concealed carry in Vermont and a very low overall crime rate there in Vermont.
[00:34:40.992 --> 00:34:44.153]  So criminals love the gun bans.
[00:34:44.573 --> 00:34:55.237]  And from this we can create this link that if somebody is being anti-gun, whether intentionally or not, they are pro-crime because you cannot delink the two.
[00:34:55.717 --> 00:34:58.438]  Anti-gun equals pro-crime.
[00:34:59.499 --> 00:34:59.799]  So
[00:35:01.522 --> 00:35:17.861]  I'd like to basically take you back in history to the 1920s during prohibition, when alcohol was banned the way heroin is banned, the way cocaine is banned, the way the gun grabbers would like to ban guns, and of course all of them were failure.
[00:35:18.587 --> 00:35:27.574]  And all that Prohibition did was take alcohol and turn it into such an expensive commodity that it literally reshaped the American political system before it was all over.
[00:35:27.914 --> 00:35:31.597]  If it hadn't been for Prohibition, there would have been no Kennedy dynasty.
[00:35:31.977 --> 00:35:34.499]  That's just one example of how powerful that was.
[00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:45.167]  But during the height of Prohibition, it was discovered that the gangsters who were making tons of money off of alcohol were covertly, secretly, through cutouts,
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.241]  They weren't funding the temperance movement.
[00:35:47.581 --> 00:35:51.822]  They were financially supporting the pro-prohibition people.
[00:35:52.162 --> 00:35:58.244]  Because they knew that as long as alcohol was banned, they could make more money.
[00:35:59.165 --> 00:36:10.188]  Well now you have a circumstance where as long as guns are banned, it's easier for criminals in the street to steal money to feed their drug habits, which makes the drug smugglers very very happy.
[00:36:10.468 --> 00:36:15.210]  So you have to wonder if there might not be, given this anti-gun equals pro-crime link,
[00:36:15.828 --> 00:36:22.233]  If we might not be seeing drug criminals covertly funding some of the gun grabber movement.
[00:36:22.573 --> 00:36:24.235]  It certainly makes fiscal sense.
[00:36:25.135 --> 00:36:31.701]  Any employer, which organized crime is, they want their employees to be as safe as possible to do their work.
[00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:33.842]  He said tongue firmly in cheek.
[00:36:35.023 --> 00:36:38.286]  Now 33 people died on the Virginia Tech campus earlier this week.
[00:36:39.046 --> 00:36:42.189]  100 times that many young Americans have died in a war in Iraq
[00:36:42.711 --> 00:36:47.876]  That was based totally on lies and by virtue of that is clearly an illegal war.
[00:36:48.556 --> 00:36:55.503]  That same war has killed 650,000 Iraqis, most of them as innocent as the Virginia Tech students.
[00:36:57.224 --> 00:36:59.846]  Most of them dead by American-made weapons.
[00:36:59.967 --> 00:37:01.368]  Are those weapons the problem?
[00:37:02.129 --> 00:37:06.893]  No, the problem is a president who every single day is setting the example
[00:37:07.699 --> 00:37:13.222]  That shooting innocent people is perfectly acceptable behavior to get what you want.
[00:37:16.264 --> 00:37:23.549]  Now, President Bush rushed out to get his photo-ops with the Virginia Tech victims' families, and don't we wish he could have moved as quickly to get to the Katrina victims.
[00:37:24.669 --> 00:37:30.413]  But Bush has far more blood on his hands, by proxy, than Cho Hsiu-Ing Hui.
[00:37:31.894 --> 00:37:34.115]  Now, President Bush likes to joke about being a dictator.
[00:37:34.577 --> 00:37:37.358]  Dictators do not like their people to be armed.
[00:37:37.618 --> 00:37:38.958]  It keeps them awake at night.
[00:37:39.458 --> 00:37:50.360]  I'm sure President Bush, as he continues to destroy our Constitution, is remembering the fate of Nikolai Ceausescu or Benito Mussolini, who died at the hands of their own well-armed people.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.782]  So certainly President Bush has a reason to, by any means, by hook and crook, disarm the American people.
[00:37:58.682 --> 00:38:02.843]  Now go back and looking through the history, every single genocide of the 20th century
[00:38:03.908 --> 00:38:07.590]  was preceded by a gun ban on the targeted population.
[00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:13.692]  Ottoman Turkey imposed a gun ban on their people and then set about exterminating the Armenians.
[00:38:14.172 --> 00:38:23.977]  The Soviet Union had a gun ban and then in the years of 1929 to 1953 exterminated 20 million political dissidents.
[00:38:24.557 --> 00:38:27.138]  We all know about Nazi Germany's gun ban.
[00:38:27.645 --> 00:38:35.133]  Hitler had one of the strictest gun bans in history, which, by the way, did not affect the German criminal elements, only the law-abiding citizens.
[00:38:35.914 --> 00:38:50.929]  And, of course, nobody was able to stand up to him when he started putting various minority groups, the Jews, the gypsies, mentally defective gays, into those slave labor camps that were a center part of his war materiel effort.
[00:38:52.238 --> 00:38:59.001]  China had a gun ban and started rounding up anti-communists from 1948 to 1952 and it goes on and on and on.
[00:38:59.021 --> 00:38:59.981]  There's a very long list.
[00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:02.122]  It's available on the net if you want to look at it.
[00:39:02.702 --> 00:39:20.309]  So, gun bans are always a harbinger for genocides on a targeted population and certainly we are seeing within our own country an ongoing attempt to victimize and scapegoat a particular ethnic and religious group as the fall guy for all of what's going on wrong with the country.
[00:39:22.433 --> 00:39:28.297]  Now, I've had a lot of people writing me emails talking about the Wild Wild West.
[00:39:28.738 --> 00:39:32.621]  Do we want to go back living as it was in the Wild West where everybody had a gun?
[00:39:33.542 --> 00:39:34.783]  Well, I have a news flash for you.
[00:39:34.843 --> 00:39:39.867]  The Wild Wild West was very very tame compared to modern America.
[00:39:41.188 --> 00:39:43.210]  We've all heard about the gunfight at the OK Corral.
[00:39:44.187 --> 00:39:45.268]  Why have we heard about it?
[00:39:45.568 --> 00:39:46.609]  It's in the history books!
[00:39:47.169 --> 00:39:48.650]  Why is it in the history books?
[00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.932]  Because it was unusual for that time.
[00:39:54.814 --> 00:40:04.240]  The Earps and the Clantons and the McClowys shooting it out with each other on a city street made the history books because at the time it happened it was shocking and unusual.
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.341]  It was not a common occurrence.
[00:40:07.748 --> 00:40:15.630]  Now, if you have a couple of drug people fighting over a turf war in Los Angeles, shooting each other down, it hardly even makes the news anymore, let alone the history books.
[00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:33.353]  Much of the image of the Wild Wild West, where everybody walked around armed, was actually crafted propaganda by Eastern industrialists, who were seeing their workers desert the factories and foundries to head out West to get their own free land, a homestead, a place where they could own their own property,
[00:40:33.706 --> 00:40:34.667]  And build their own house.
[00:40:35.007 --> 00:40:36.728]  And these workers were leaving the factories.
[00:40:37.048 --> 00:40:44.954]  So the industrialists who owned the factories hired writers at newspapers to write stories about what a terrible place the Wild West was.
[00:40:45.314 --> 00:40:47.356]  Oh, you don't want to take your family and go there.
[00:40:47.756 --> 00:40:49.117]  Bad things will happen to you.
[00:40:49.857 --> 00:40:53.540]  There's wild men all over that will just shoot you dead at the drop of a hat.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.282]  Oh, you better stay here and work in my factory where you're going to be safe.
[00:40:57.216 --> 00:41:09.285]  Hollywood, of course, picked up on the dime novels and the newspaper articles about the Wild West because it was good storytelling and it didn't hurt that Wyatt Earp became a consultant in Hollywood for Western movies after the OK Corral incident.
[00:41:09.945 --> 00:41:14.768]  And they blew up this image of the Wild Wild West that entertains us all today.
[00:41:15.149 --> 00:41:16.710]  But it's not real.
[00:41:18.011 --> 00:41:26.837]  It's a made-up myth of adventure and good storytelling, but the reality is that out in the Wild Wild West, acts of violence were far less common
[00:41:27.386 --> 00:41:33.950]  than in the eastern cities and certainly in today America, especially in cities where there are gun bans and gun control.
[00:41:34.431 --> 00:41:37.433]  Compared to modern-day America, the Wild West was rather tame.
[00:41:37.533 --> 00:41:38.653]  Okay, I've yacked enough.
[00:41:38.693 --> 00:41:42.076]  I know you're tired of listening to me, so let's go on and get a few more phone calls.
[00:41:42.116 --> 00:41:43.156]  John down in Texas.
[00:41:43.196 --> 00:41:44.057]  John, are you on the phone?
[00:41:44.917 --> 00:41:45.578]  Yes, I am.
[00:41:46.318 --> 00:41:47.319]  Well, thank you for waiting.
[00:41:47.339 --> 00:41:48.460]  What would you like to talk about?
[00:41:49.961 --> 00:41:53.403]  Um, first I just wanted to say thank you for, uh,
[00:41:53.854 --> 00:42:05.185]  Your sacrifice and standing up when a lot of people won't, uh, you know, considering the force that like you and Alex and other guys are going up against, you know, that takes a lot of manhood.
[00:42:06.266 --> 00:42:15.875]  And, uh, I honestly like to agree with you on the, uh, this seems like it would be like the next step in like a military takeover for like, uh,
[00:42:17.133 --> 00:42:19.614]  Well, there's a lot of denial going on.
[00:42:19.654 --> 00:42:28.098]  We're raised with all this history about these terrible things that happen in other countries like Nazi Germany, but at the same time our state-sponsored schools are telling us
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:50.288]  These things could never happen here, because we're the good guys, and we don't do things like that, and we stand for truth and justice in the American way, whatever the heck that happens to me this week.
[00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:57.513]  So, there's a lot of denial, but it's breaking through, and you talk about Alex and my having a great deal of courage.
[00:42:57.533 --> 00:42:58.154]  Well, so do you.
[00:42:58.714 --> 00:43:01.757]  So does everybody who calls this show, and so does everybody who
[00:43:04.362 --> 00:43:23.458]  Uh, has the courage to speak out publicly because one of the illusions the government likes to create is that we're all alone out here, that we're the only ones who are concerned about these things, that we're the only ones who think these thoughts, and so you have this room full of people standing around and they all know what's going on, but they won't speak out because they think they're the only one that's there.
[00:43:23.938 --> 00:43:26.240]  So when you have the courage to speak out publicly,
[00:43:26.755 --> 00:43:30.538]  You're going to give courage to all those other people and they're going to say, I've been thinking the same thing.
[00:43:30.598 --> 00:43:31.919]  I thought I was the only one.
[00:43:32.539 --> 00:43:39.324]  So, here's a pat on the back for everybody out there who speaks out publicly because you're doing more good than you could ever possibly imagine.
[00:43:39.804 --> 00:43:41.746]  John, if you don't have anything else, I need to move along.
[00:43:41.766 --> 00:43:43.487]  The pitch board has really let up.
[00:43:43.567 --> 00:43:44.848]  Yeah, I just want to say one thing.
[00:43:46.549 --> 00:43:50.232]  I've been a... I know I'm taking this the wrong way, but I've been a...
[00:43:51.089 --> 00:44:09.675]  I've been a pagan priest for 16 years and I have it from a very high contact who is an ex-member of the Temple of the Lord of the Golden Dawn that this new world leader is just ready and waiting to take over next year that they do intend to make Bush the last president.
[00:44:09.735 --> 00:44:20.858]  So if anyone thinks it's going to be a regular election, there's going to be a fight against it because they're going to do everything they can to make sure that this thing hitches off
[00:44:21.628 --> 00:44:31.557]  Okay, well thank you for sharing that with us, and thanks for the call.
[00:44:31.597 --> 00:44:32.657]  We're going to move along here.
[00:44:32.918 --> 00:44:34.559]  We've got Tony, also in Texas.
[00:44:34.679 --> 00:44:35.980]  Got a lot of calls from Texas today.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.721]  Tony, are you there?
[00:44:38.202 --> 00:44:38.462]  Hello?
[00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:39.103]  Hello, Tony.
[00:44:39.463 --> 00:44:40.064]  Hello, Tony?
[00:44:40.324 --> 00:44:40.644]  Yes, sir.
[00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:41.965]  You're on the air.
[00:44:42.005 --> 00:44:42.746]  What can I do for you?
[00:44:42.986 --> 00:44:44.768]  Well, first of all, a couple of points.
[00:44:44.908 --> 00:44:48.691]  As far as a gun ban on a publicly funded institution,
[00:44:49.269 --> 00:44:53.413]  United States Constitution gives us the right to keep and bear arms.
[00:44:54.513 --> 00:44:59.898]  And the gun grabbers would like to say that it says we should have a well-regulated militia.
[00:45:00.318 --> 00:45:05.743]  Well, that doesn't mean that everyone should be regulated to death with laws.
[00:45:05.783 --> 00:45:11.908]  What that meant, regulated at that time meant being able to drill with your weapon, keep it clean, and be able to shoot it straight.
[00:45:13.504 --> 00:45:18.768]  Yes, at the time that the Second Amendment was written, regulated was a mechanical, not a legal term.
[00:45:18.908 --> 00:45:19.628]  Exactly.
[00:45:20.148 --> 00:45:26.653]  Yeah, the regulation on a steam engine was its governor, and the regulation on a gun was the sights.
[00:45:26.793 --> 00:45:27.413]  That's right.
[00:45:27.493 --> 00:45:36.359]  So, what the Second Amendment was, is that the citizen's militia should have the best quality firearms they could make, which makes perfect sense.
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:41.343]  You know, if you're talking about a militia, you want them to have the best, most capable weapons possible.
[00:45:41.443 --> 00:45:43.304]  And being able to shoot them straight, yes sir.
[00:45:44.499 --> 00:45:45.060]  Absolutely.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:52.144]  My other point is, I've heard one person talking about missing White House emails since this shooting, since Don Imus really.
[00:45:52.365 --> 00:45:55.126]  Don Imus was the first distraction, this seems to be the second.
[00:45:55.807 --> 00:45:57.528]  This young gentleman had 50 rounds.
[00:45:57.648 --> 00:45:59.629]  He killed 31 people including himself.
[00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.711]  That leaves 19 rounds that missed.
[00:46:03.532 --> 00:46:05.053]  That's pretty good shooting if you ask me.
[00:46:06.914 --> 00:46:09.294]  Well, from a certain point of view, yes.
[00:46:09.474 --> 00:46:16.416]  Actually, I think he was a very bad human being, even though he was a good shot, but he was a very bad human being, and let's focus on that.
[00:46:17.176 --> 00:46:22.437]  That's true, but what I'm saying is you don't get to be a good shot with 9mm pistols like that without a little practice.
[00:46:24.177 --> 00:46:26.497]  Well, definitely, I would agree with that.
[00:46:26.937 --> 00:46:29.218]  There's more to this gentleman's background than we've been told so far.
[00:46:29.578 --> 00:46:30.858]  Tony, we have to move along.
[00:46:30.878 --> 00:46:32.698]  We've got a lot of calls and very little time.
[00:46:33.138 --> 00:46:34.639]  Larry in Indiana, are you there?
[00:46:37.228 --> 00:46:38.368]  Larry, what can I do for you?
[00:46:38.708 --> 00:46:44.910]  Well, the problem is people don't understand the depths that those that are behind this will sink to.
[00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:52.931]  I didn't until I read a book by a guy that was set up and imprisoned, Fritz Springmeier, who Alex had some material on.
[00:46:53.812 --> 00:46:58.332]  He had written extensively on the Illuminati and what they call MK-Ultra mind control.
[00:46:58.873 --> 00:47:05.534]  You just can't imagine how CIA's head, Bush Sr., what MK-Ultra involves, which includes
[00:47:06.246 --> 00:47:10.648]  The torture and rape of children, sometimes as young as 18 months old.
[00:47:10.668 --> 00:47:16.251]  You know, the documented pedophile incidences of Dick Cheney and Bush Sr.
[00:47:16.792 --> 00:47:21.214]  are in books by Kathy O'Brien called Transformation of America.
[00:47:22.209 --> 00:47:25.292]  Daddy Bush was having dinner with Hinckley Jr.'
[00:47:25.272 --> 00:47:32.017]  's brother the night before Reagan was assassinated by Hinckley Jr., which was another Manchurian candidate.
[00:47:33.038 --> 00:47:35.860]  You've got to research these mind control programs.
[00:47:36.421 --> 00:47:40.844]  MK-ALTRA, MK-SEARCH, MK-DELTA, PROJECT ARCHIVE, PROJECT NAOMI.
[00:47:40.924 --> 00:47:42.486]  All this stuff is on the Internet.
[00:47:43.666 --> 00:47:46.709]  You've got to bypass the media and find out what's going on here.
[00:47:47.208 --> 00:47:48.528]  Hollywood knows about this.
[00:47:48.568 --> 00:47:57.250]  We've got two versions of the Manchurian Candidate movie, Minefield, Conspiracy Theory, all these deal with mind control assassins.
[00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:59.791]  People have to do their own research.
[00:48:00.291 --> 00:48:14.514]  You know, I thank you for your information on 9-11, at WhatReallyHappened.com, as well as, I believe, what's on RealNews247.com, as far as what happened to 9-11.
[00:48:14.534 --> 00:48:16.774]  You're never going to hear this in the controlled media.
[00:48:17.492 --> 00:48:25.776]  But what we're looking at with 9-11 is another form of what they call satanic ritual abuse, or trauma-based mind control.
[00:48:26.296 --> 00:48:34.320]  You kill people, you create a trauma, in order to get people to do something they wouldn't ordinarily do, also called the Hegelian dialectic.
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:43.144]  You've got to understand how the enemy works, because if you disarm, you are doing exactly what the real murderers want you to do, and you're next.
[00:48:44.445 --> 00:48:45.005]  Absolutely.
[00:48:45.065 --> 00:48:46.366]  Larry, we have to move along.
[00:48:46.426 --> 00:48:47.186]  Thank you very much.
[00:48:47.926 --> 00:48:49.409]  Let's get one more call before the break.
[00:48:49.469 --> 00:48:50.853]  Richard in Texas, are you there?
[00:48:51.655 --> 00:48:52.196]  Yes, I am.
[00:48:52.955 --> 00:49:16.251]  Just wanted to mention a couple of things real quickly, and one is that, you know, talking about this mind control and mental illness stuff, there's going to be a big push, I think, to make sure that kids are properly medicated and that sort of thing, rather than focusing on the fact that the antidepressants could well have been a factor in his psychosis and or mind control.
[00:49:17.311 --> 00:49:22.755]  You know, and I think that's another agenda that's going to be unfortunately promoted by this unfortunate tragedy.
[00:49:23.916 --> 00:49:28.559]  Yeah, but in this case the mental health system broke down because they had the guy.
[00:49:28.599 --> 00:49:34.743]  They were watching him, they had him under medication, he was in counseling, and they still let him back out again.
[00:49:34.803 --> 00:49:39.806]  So I think along with discrediting the effectiveness of the police in situations like this,
[00:49:40.157 --> 00:49:45.202]  I think Virginia Tech has discredited the effectiveness of all this forced mental screening and medication.
[00:49:45.643 --> 00:49:53.751]  As you say, there is a long history of these antidepressants being linked to young people's suicide and irrational acts of behavior.
[00:49:54.411 --> 00:49:58.255]  And you need to really consider, an antidepressant doesn't make the depression go away.
[00:49:58.616 --> 00:50:00.778]  It just sort of walls it off to one side.
[00:50:01.286 --> 00:50:10.629]  Until whatever is causing the depression builds up to such a pressure that it just explodes right through, and that's when things really, really get out of control.
[00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:13.870]  Richard, thanks an awful lot.
[00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:16.691]  We're going to try and squeeze one more call in here before we go to break.
[00:50:16.832 --> 00:50:18.632]  Jared in New York, are you there?
[00:50:19.332 --> 00:50:19.973]  Yes, hello?
[00:50:20.713 --> 00:50:21.653]  Hi, what can I do for you?
[00:50:24.434 --> 00:50:28.976]  With the shooting, I don't know if you guys heard, but I heard earlier today on Can-Can
[00:50:30.256 --> 00:50:36.521]  Because earlier I heard Alex say that to watch... Okay, Jared, Jared, we're going to have to hold you across the break.
[00:50:36.582 --> 00:50:37.542]  Please stay on the line.
[00:50:37.562 --> 00:50:39.924]  We'll be right back after a few more commercials here.
[00:50:39.964 --> 00:50:41.266]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:41.646 --> 00:50:45.349]  I'm your guest host, Mike Rivero, webmaster of whatreallyhappened.com.
[00:50:45.429 --> 00:50:49.052]  Cheap plug, plug, plug, plug, and we'll be right back after a few words from our sponsors.
[00:51:03.573 --> 00:51:06.735]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:07.075 --> 00:51:09.017]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:09.377 --> 00:51:17.002]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:17.717 --> 00:51:24.781]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.161 --> 00:51:36.627]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.907 --> 00:51:40.409]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:40.869 --> 00:51:42.830]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:46.912]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.874 --> 00:52:02.915]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:52:03.235 --> 00:52:06.015]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:52:06.295 --> 00:52:10.436]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:52:10.876 --> 00:52:11.716]  So what do you do?
[00:52:12.016 --> 00:52:16.577]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:52:17.077 --> 00:52:19.199]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:34.394]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:34.434 --> 00:52:41.501]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:01.861]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:02.081 --> 00:53:05.783]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:06.103 --> 00:53:15.027]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:15.187 --> 00:53:20.090]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:29.254]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[00:53:29.634 --> 00:53:35.638]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[00:54:09.174 --> 00:54:11.436]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:11.456 --> 00:54:12.537]  This is our last segment.
[00:54:12.577 --> 00:54:13.537]  We're running out of time.
[00:54:13.577 --> 00:54:15.319]  We got a lot of calls and a lot to say.
[00:54:15.339 --> 00:54:16.900]  Let's get back to Jared in New York.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.081]  Jared, what can we do for you?
[00:54:18.721 --> 00:54:21.563]  Yes, I don't know if you guys took to the Alex earlier.
[00:54:21.783 --> 00:54:30.530]  I think day before yesterday, he said that look for a copycat like incidents like related to the Virginia shooting.
[00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:36.174]  And this morning I heard on 10th and Williams that there was there was North Carolina, North Carolina, there was a shooting.
[00:54:36.987 --> 00:54:40.850]  So I guess that was a black operation.
[00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:48.435]  Well, like I said at the top of the show, we're just treating it as if it's exactly as reported and we're not going to get into the more extreme things.
[00:54:48.575 --> 00:54:53.058]  But again, it shows that gun bans don't work because there was a gun ban on the campus.
[00:54:53.118 --> 00:54:57.180]  It proves the police are not going to get in there and protect you.
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:58.521]  And as a matter of fact, the U.S.
[00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:04.305]  Supreme Court ruled in Castle Rock v. Gonzalez that you have no constitutional right to police protection.
[00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:09.672]  It's purely discretionary on their part, and if they don't save you from a crime, you cannot sue them.
[00:55:10.312 --> 00:55:13.553]  So that tells you something about the degree of protection that you have here.
[00:55:13.993 --> 00:55:15.133]  Okay, we're going to have to move along.
[00:55:15.153 --> 00:55:17.514]  I have a couple of comments, and then we're going to grab a couple more phone calls.
[00:55:17.554 --> 00:55:22.556]  And before we get out of here, I want to thank John for totaling the dials and keeping things organized during this hour.
[00:55:23.149 --> 00:55:26.231]  And we'll be back the same time tomorrow for one more go at this thing.
[00:55:27.011 --> 00:55:31.834]  Now, the Second Amendment of the Constitution was not put in there to protect sport shooting.
[00:55:31.934 --> 00:55:33.895]  It was not put in there to guarantee hunting.
[00:55:34.275 --> 00:55:39.658]  It was there to give the people the right to say no to the government.
[00:55:40.438 --> 00:55:41.819]  And I want you to consider this.
[00:55:41.899 --> 00:55:45.321]  There is no freedom without the freedom to say no.
[00:55:45.821 --> 00:55:46.721]  No to lies.
[00:55:46.902 --> 00:55:48.002]  No to an illegal war.
[00:55:48.382 --> 00:55:49.963]  No to ever higher taxes.
[00:55:50.423 --> 00:55:51.424]  No to a draft.
[00:55:52.037 --> 00:55:55.320]  If you don't have the freedom to say no, then you are not free.
[00:55:55.781 --> 00:56:00.285]  And the Second Amendment is about preserving your freedom to say no to the government.
[00:56:00.466 --> 00:56:01.767]  Let's grab Jeff in Missouri.
[00:56:01.807 --> 00:56:02.428]  Jeff, are you there?
[00:56:02.768 --> 00:56:03.248]  Yes, I am.
[00:56:03.288 --> 00:56:04.349]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:06.712]  What can we do for you real quick?
[00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:15.535]  First, I'm glad you and Alex Jones aren't trying to turn this into a political issue right off the bat and just reporting the news as it's being reported.
[00:56:15.756 --> 00:56:18.477]  There's plenty of time to go into all that later on.
[00:56:19.018 --> 00:56:26.383]  Let the people bury their children, let them mourn, and then we can deal with the underlining issues as they develop.
[00:56:27.864 --> 00:56:29.184]  Okay, well thank you very much.
[00:56:30.185 --> 00:56:33.387]  Okay, let's go on to Lucas in Texas.
[00:56:33.627 --> 00:56:34.408]  Last call for the day.
[00:56:36.144 --> 00:56:37.085]  Hey, what's up, brother?
[00:56:37.105 --> 00:56:37.785]  Good to talk to you.
[00:56:38.726 --> 00:56:43.730]  Hey, I just wanted to read a quick excerpt out of page 2 of the Manifesto by Cho.
[00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:48.293]  Real quickly, it says, Are you happy now that you've destroyed my life?
[00:56:48.673 --> 00:56:51.135]  Now that you have stolen everything you could from me?
[00:56:51.515 --> 00:56:55.799]  Now that you have gone on a 9-11 on my life like blank Osama?
[00:56:56.219 --> 00:56:59.842]  Now that you have blank your own people like blank Kim Jong II?
[00:57:00.622 --> 00:57:04.505]  Now that you have gone on a Hummer Safari on my life like blank Bush?
[00:57:04.685 --> 00:57:05.446]  Are you happy now?
[00:57:06.451 --> 00:57:07.771]  I thought that was pretty interesting.
[00:57:07.811 --> 00:57:10.892]  That was on page two of his manifesto on MSNBC.com.
[00:57:12.652 --> 00:57:18.133]  Well, you know, I think it's very obvious that this gentleman had some major, major issues.
[00:57:18.213 --> 00:57:21.814]  And again, it's a failure of our taxpayer-funded mental health system.
[00:57:22.174 --> 00:57:23.554]  They knew the guy had problems.
[00:57:23.574 --> 00:57:24.434]  They had him in counseling.
[00:57:24.474 --> 00:57:25.334]  They were watching him.
[00:57:25.895 --> 00:57:28.835]  And still, they let him back out to do what he was going to do.
[00:57:29.515 --> 00:57:31.096]  Thank you very much for your call, Lucas.
[00:57:31.196 --> 00:57:33.176]  We're coming down here to the end of the show.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.641]  And I want to leave it with this closing thought.
[00:57:36.861 --> 00:57:46.386]  Every year in the United States, between a half million and two million crimes are thwarted by private citizens using legally owned firearms.
[00:57:46.686 --> 00:57:49.627]  That's the little secret the gun grabbers don't want you to know about.
[00:57:49.988 --> 00:57:52.329]  The police do not thwart crimes.
[00:57:52.529 --> 00:57:54.470]  They show up after the crimes are all over.
[00:57:54.949 --> 00:58:01.671]  They will promise to solve the crime and arrest the perpetrator, but they don't thwart, they don't stop, they don't prevent.
[00:58:01.951 --> 00:58:05.992]  When a crime happens, there are only two people present, the criminal and the victim.
[00:58:06.572 --> 00:58:13.573]  And the only way to stop the crime in progress is for the victim to be able to do it for themselves, and that's really what this all comes down to.
[00:58:14.274 --> 00:58:16.474]  This is Mike Rivera, guest hosting for Alex Jones.
[00:58:16.514 --> 00:58:20.295]  I want to thank Alex for giving me the opportunity to sit at the microphone on his time.
[00:58:20.894 --> 00:58:30.422]  Tomorrow we'll be talking about the situation in Iraq with Mideast reporter Trish Hsu and what's going on over there as the puppet government of Iraq struggles to hold itself together.
[00:58:31.063 --> 00:58:31.803]  Talk to you tomorrow.
[00:58:32.424 --> 00:58:33.045]  Have a good day.
[00:58:34.186 --> 00:58:38.069]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:56.039 --> 00:58:56.699]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.359 --> 00:58:58.419]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:00.240]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:01.700]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.461 --> 00:59:03.361]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.021 --> 00:59:07.962]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.203 --> 00:59:12.324]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.925 --> 00:59:18.286]  The show must go on!
[00:59:19.984 --> 00:59:24.569]  Welcome to the second hour of the Alex Jones Show this 19th day of April 2007.
[00:59:25.169 --> 00:59:30.795]  I'm Jack Blood, your radio gun filling in for Alex Jones this next two hours.
[00:59:30.955 --> 00:59:35.039]  Alex is scheduled to join us, pop in with us here in about 30 minutes.
[00:59:35.599 --> 00:59:40.680]  for breaking news and to further discuss recent developments in the Virginia Tech shooting.
[00:59:41.341 --> 00:59:44.521]  We will be discussing that throughout the program today.
[00:59:44.561 --> 00:59:45.822]  We've got a lot of new information.
[00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:49.062]  Some of it I reported on my program yesterday on this very network.
[00:59:49.102 --> 00:59:50.843]  We'll go over some of that with you.
[00:59:50.863 --> 00:59:54.344]  We'll give you some examples of prescription drugs and shootings.
[00:59:54.804 --> 00:59:57.565]  They seem to have a direct connection to one another.
[00:59:58.085 --> 00:59:58.645]  We will out
[00:59:59.725 --> 01:00:09.536]  The Cho family, I mean we've got to put the news on the record for you folks and we will talk about some of the spurious relationships of Cho's family.
[01:00:09.696 --> 01:00:13.300]  Both of them, one of them currently working as a contractor for Condoleezza Rice.
[01:00:13.881 --> 01:00:15.923]  The other one formerly worked for the State Department.
[01:00:17.004 --> 01:00:27.390]  We'll try to, again, make sense of this story for you and report the news on the Genesis Communications Radio Network that you are not going to hear on MSNBC, Fox News, Cable News and Network News.
[01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:29.151]  So I'm so glad you could join us today.
[01:00:29.191 --> 01:00:31.733]  Today is a very interesting day in history.
[01:00:32.453 --> 01:00:44.498]  As most of you know, today is the anniversary for both the Oklahoma City bombing and the end of the Waco siege where 21 children were burned alive at the BATF on either my program today or on Alex's show.
[01:00:44.518 --> 01:00:46.959]  I've got a great clip from Bill Hicks regarding that.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:54.903]  But also on this day in history, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced that the United States will be abandoning the gold standard.
[01:00:55.323 --> 01:01:05.630]  On this day in history, 1943 in Poland, German troops enter the Warsaw Ghetto to round up the remaining Jews and begin the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.
[01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:08.472]  1961, the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba ends in failure.
[01:01:09.173 --> 01:01:12.915]  1976, Executive Order 9066 is rescinded.
[01:01:12.955 --> 01:01:18.139]  Executive Order 9066 was a presidential order to send ethnic groups to internment camps.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:25.586]  1993, the 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian building outside Waco, Texas, USA, ends when fire breaks out.
[01:01:26.426 --> 01:01:27.207]  81 people die.
[01:01:27.227 --> 01:01:30.290]  21 children were sacrificed.
[01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:31.891]  1995, the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:40.039]  Alfred P. Murrow Felder building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA, is bombed, killing 168, including children who were sacrificed.
[01:01:40.891 --> 01:01:51.017]  And 2005, Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger elected Pope Benedict XVI on the second day of the papal conclave.
[01:01:51.177 --> 01:01:56.181]  Very interesting day in history, and this is shaping up to be a heck of a week in history.
[01:01:56.281 --> 01:02:02.224]  I believe when this time comes around next year, I will be on vacation in my bunker somewhere.
[01:02:02.284 --> 01:02:02.945]  We have added
[01:02:03.745 --> 01:02:07.868]  To all of these things and of course the anniversary for the Columbine shooting tomorrow.
[01:02:08.668 --> 01:02:14.252]  This deadly deadly attack for which we all mourn at Virginia Tech University.
[01:02:14.352 --> 01:02:16.734]  So I don't know what it is about this week.
[01:02:17.654 --> 01:02:20.616]  I have my suspicions.
[01:02:20.696 --> 01:02:27.020]  We have talked to a lot of people, done a lot of research about this particular momentous time in our calendar.
[01:02:27.821 --> 01:02:31.643]  But this is the question I think that should be asked and needs to be asked.
[01:02:31.663 --> 01:02:32.644]  We're going to cover all of that
[01:02:34.021 --> 01:02:36.543]  On the program today, also some breaking news.
[01:02:36.783 --> 01:02:40.145]  Accidental shooting stirs the Secret Service.
[01:02:40.185 --> 01:02:42.868]  Maybe we need to take away the Secret Service's guns.
[01:02:43.728 --> 01:02:47.992]  Two Secret Service officers were injured in an accidental shooting Tuesday at the White House.
[01:02:48.772 --> 01:02:52.275]  The incident occurred in a security booth in the Southwest Gate.
[01:02:53.493 --> 01:02:59.956]  Secret Service spokesperson, Kim Bruce, said one officer was injured in the leg and another received shrapnel wound in his face.
[01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:06.920]  She said the injuries appeared to be non-life-threatening and that both officers were taken to nearby George Washington University Hospital.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.361]  The gun involved was a service-issued weapon, she said.
[01:03:10.842 --> 01:03:14.703]  She said the Secret Service Office of Inspection would conduct a review.
[01:03:15.364 --> 01:03:19.766]  In a separate incident at Lafayette Park along Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House,
[01:03:20.406 --> 01:03:26.528]  Uh, was closed because of a suspicious package, the Secret Service said, when they weren't busy accidentally shooting each other.
[01:03:27.728 --> 01:03:35.050]  There was a security clampdown at the White House because of both simultaneous incidents that just happened an hour or so ago.
[01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:37.310]  Uh, this morning, according to my information.
[01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:38.111]  We'll take a quick break.
[01:03:38.131 --> 01:03:38.691]  We'll come back.
[01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:39.871]  More of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:03:39.931 --> 01:03:41.431]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:03:41.772 --> 01:03:43.112]  Alex should appear momentarily.
[01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:43.472]  Stay tuned.
[01:03:54.682 --> 01:03:57.846]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:58.166 --> 01:04:00.088]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:00.488 --> 01:04:08.137]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:08.815 --> 01:04:15.861]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:16.261 --> 01:04:27.730]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.011 --> 01:04:31.593]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:31.974 --> 01:04:33.895]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:34.236 --> 01:04:38.079]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:54.308 --> 01:04:57.089]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:57.369 --> 01:05:01.532]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:01.932 --> 01:05:02.772]  So what do you do?
[01:05:03.092 --> 01:05:07.655]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:08.135 --> 01:05:10.257]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:10.757 --> 01:05:11.638]  Sheltering in Place!
[01:05:12.038 --> 01:05:25.448]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:32.553]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:32.893 --> 01:05:37.296]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:05:37.736 --> 01:05:39.518]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:39.538 --> 01:05:39.758]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:39.838 --> 01:05:41.319]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:55.666]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[01:05:55.926 --> 01:05:59.789]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:05.174]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[01:06:05.454 --> 01:06:16.643]  Electrolyzed Plus Water will alkalinize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[01:06:16.963 --> 01:06:21.305]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and environmentally safe for humans and animals.
[01:06:21.565 --> 01:06:30.888]  Alkaline water is available as a concentrate to be mixed with good, filtered, purified RO water but not tap water, microstructured alkaline antioxidant water for consumption.
[01:06:31.048 --> 01:06:40.671]  Call for your Electrolyzed Plus Alkalinizing Miracle Rejuvenating Water Concentrate or other remarkable RPA Biotech products like Ultimate Fuel, Sport Performance Drink, at 888-212-8871
[01:06:43.452 --> 01:06:47.254]  That's 888-212-8871, or go to NutraMedical.com.
[01:06:47.414 --> 01:06:50.275]  That's a new TRI, with an I, Medical.com.
[01:06:51.855 --> 01:06:57.497]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.919 --> 01:07:03.800]  Jack Blood, your radio gun, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:09.382]  Alex will be joining us here in just about 20 minutes with some breaking news, so please stay tuned for that.
[01:07:11.571 --> 01:07:16.815]  We have been covering this story almost non-stop for the last several days.
[01:07:16.855 --> 01:07:18.676]  That is the Virginia Tech mass murder.
[01:07:19.777 --> 01:07:20.737]  And we have to do this.
[01:07:20.797 --> 01:07:28.663]  I know that's why people listen to this network, to the Genesis Network, because they want to hear the news they're not getting on network TV.
[01:07:28.783 --> 01:07:36.868]  And with every new bit of information, that information needs to be clarified, it needs to be decoded, it needs to be debunked.
[01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:39.231]  And that's what we do here on this program.
[01:07:39.291 --> 01:07:42.234]  So, of course, we need to put this disclaimer on our program.
[01:07:42.755 --> 01:07:45.298]  We mean absolutely no disrespect to the victims.
[01:07:45.358 --> 01:07:50.324]  In fact, we feel for them in a way that I'm not sure the mainstream media or the gun grabbers do.
[01:07:50.424 --> 01:07:52.327]  And I'm sure all of you are with me on that.
[01:07:52.367 --> 01:07:56.492]  All of you are sending your meditations, your prayers to the people that have been injured in this
[01:07:57.325 --> 01:08:01.048]  Uh, just deadly, deadly, terrible shooting, terrible incident.
[01:08:01.548 --> 01:08:13.456]  Uh, but that does not mean that we need to go into a moratorium here and not cover the important news, the important facts that surround this event, uh, which I know Alex Jones is indicating very much, uh, very well could be a psyop.
[01:08:13.536 --> 01:08:24.464]  I think, really, with the NBC video, which, by the way, was sent to Rockefeller Center, another calling card, like the 33 dead in this particular instance, uh,
[01:08:25.297 --> 01:08:30.844]  I personally, my, I know Alex is going to come on and talk about this, but personally, I mean this kind of completes the PSYOP.
[01:08:30.904 --> 01:08:41.756]  You have now, on the record, for all the world to see the manifesto of this lone nut, this madman, who we need to protect ourselves against.
[01:08:41.796 --> 01:08:42.717]  Well, that's the truth.
[01:08:42.938 --> 01:08:44.800]  We need to protect ourselves against this madman.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:56.663]  Of course, the government will tell you they need to protect you from madmen like this, and this links directly into mental health screening, the behavioral police, or the thought police.
[01:08:57.184 --> 01:09:05.346]  At any point, if you look somewhat suspicious, now you would think with all the school shootings in the past that something like this might have already been put into place, but like
[01:09:05.766 --> 01:09:07.548]  The 93 World Trade Center bombing.
[01:09:07.588 --> 01:09:10.771]  Like today's anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:09:10.852 --> 01:09:14.395]  It wasn't enough to get the job done for a giant psyops.
[01:09:14.435 --> 01:09:16.457]  They needed 9-11 to complete the work.
[01:09:16.517 --> 01:09:19.741]  And this is kind of the 9-11 of school shootings in my mind.
[01:09:19.761 --> 01:09:21.463]  But it makes Joe famous.
[01:09:22.063 --> 01:09:29.949]  And I gotta tell you, that is a direct message to anyone else out there who might want to be a copycat to be as famous as Cho.
[01:09:29.969 --> 01:09:31.891]  And I wonder who's going to be playing him in the movie.
[01:09:31.911 --> 01:09:36.315]  And again, I don't mean to make light of this, but these are all points that I think need to be made.
[01:09:36.355 --> 01:09:49.165]  Now yesterday, on my program, which follows Alex's show Monday through Friday here on this very network, we talked about some information that I think is important to put on the record regarding the connections and some of the
[01:09:50.431 --> 01:09:56.617]  I think coincidence is linking this shooting to the Columbine shooting, the anniversary of which is tomorrow.
[01:09:56.737 --> 01:09:59.380]  I call this Bowling for Blacksburg.
[01:10:00.641 --> 01:10:05.286]  Now, many of you saw Bowling for Columbine by Shil Michael Boer.
[01:10:06.352 --> 01:10:13.195]  And one of the interesting notes in that documentary was the influence that Lockheed Martin had over Columbine.
[01:10:13.255 --> 01:10:16.017]  Literally, as Michael Morris says, owning the town.
[01:10:16.077 --> 01:10:25.581]  Most of the parents at Columbine worked for the military-industrial complex and Lockheed Martin was the prime funder of that particular town.
[01:10:25.601 --> 01:10:29.603]  Well, let me tell you this happy coincidence, or horrible coincidence, sorry.
[01:10:30.404 --> 01:10:36.195]  That I think also reflects some very similar coincidences with Columbine.
[01:10:36.856 --> 01:10:41.004]  And this was printed, by the way, in I believe the Chicago Tribune.
[01:10:41.973 --> 01:11:00.156]  uh... on the seventeenth of april fairfax county virginia police investigators said today the virginia tech gunman joseph lee was a two thousand three graduate of the same high school attended by an eighteen-year-old who went on a shooting rampage last year at a virginia police station killing two officers that's right folks
[01:11:00.596 --> 01:11:03.638]  Joe went to the same high school as another mass shooter.
[01:11:03.879 --> 01:11:05.079]  His name was Michael Kennedy.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.420]  He was armed with an AK-47.
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:18.329]  He fired more than 70 rounds in the parking lot of a Sully District Police Station on May 8th, killing Detective Vicki Armel and Master Police Officer Michael Garbarino.
[01:11:18.749 --> 01:11:22.752]  Kennedy was shot to death by police and wasn't available for comment.
[01:11:23.408 --> 01:11:33.351]  Cho and Kennedy lived in Centerville and graduated from Westfield High School, an officer said, Courtney Thibault of Fairfax County Police Department.
[01:11:33.651 --> 01:11:36.032]  She said Cho graduated four years ahead of Kennedy.
[01:11:36.432 --> 01:11:47.775]  Once Cho's identity was released by police in Blacksburg, Virginia, home of Virginia Tech, Thibault and the Fairfax County Police launched an investigation to determine if there was any connection between the two shooters.
[01:11:48.315 --> 01:11:51.399]  She said they found nothing tying the two men together.
[01:11:51.539 --> 01:11:54.042]  Nothing, except they both became mass murderers.
[01:11:55.922 --> 01:11:58.063]  It's just a horrible coincidence, she said.
[01:11:58.103 --> 01:11:58.924]  It's hard to believe.
[01:11:59.444 --> 01:12:06.828]  Kennedy's father, Brian Kennedy, was also charged earlier this month with helping his son to obtain the AK-47 used in the rampage.
[01:12:07.128 --> 01:12:15.613]  Federal prosecutors claim he was illegally in possession of a small arsenal of weapons, including rifles, shotguns, handguns, and more than 2,500 rounds of ammunition.
[01:12:15.653 --> 01:12:21.256]  Now, here's an interesting post-script for Westfield High School.
[01:12:21.886 --> 01:12:35.684]  Westfield, the high school that Cho went to and that Michael Kennedy went to, shares a business partnership with Northrop Grumman's Intelligence Group that entails the sharing of buildings as well as financial donations and gifts from supply.
[01:12:35.704 --> 01:12:36.686]  So there you have it, folks.
[01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:52.825]  A very, very interesting coincidence, and most of you who have done research on 9-11 or false flag terrorism understand these myriad of coincidences and how the law of averages are millions to one, that these particular coincidences could take place.
[01:12:53.025 --> 01:12:53.805]  Here we have two.
[01:12:54.406 --> 01:13:03.592]  One, two shooters, two shooters going on a rampage from the same school, there at the same time, sharing a complex with Northrop Grumman's intelligence group.
[01:13:04.751 --> 01:13:22.010]  And the second coincidence, that is of course with Columbine, Lockheed Martin and another high beneficiary from the War on Terror, high beneficiary of the military-industrial complex, also the Columbine High School beneficiary or benefactor.
[01:13:23.913 --> 01:13:27.655]  I mean, these are hard coincidences to ignore, I have to say.
[01:13:27.675 --> 01:13:32.477]  And of course, we found many other coincidences, as we say.
[01:13:32.717 --> 01:13:38.100]  Many people now talking about the DARPA secret underground facility in Blacksburg.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:42.182]  Of course, we need to do more checking and to try to get some more information.
[01:13:42.262 --> 01:13:44.343]  But it is, of course, a secret location.
[01:13:45.343 --> 01:13:51.469]  At least only one eyewitness has talked about it, but of course we can, I'm sure, find more information on that.
[01:13:52.190 --> 01:14:05.502]  Also, NASA connections with Virginia Tech and one of the victims of the shooting, and just a myriad of other potential triggers that could be involved in this.
[01:14:05.562 --> 01:14:09.366]  Now, one of the things we also know about Mr. Cho,
[01:14:11.278 --> 01:14:13.219]  Is that he was physically abused.
[01:14:13.239 --> 01:14:14.939]  This is what his parents talk about.
[01:14:14.959 --> 01:14:16.619]  That he was quiet as a child.
[01:14:16.659 --> 01:14:17.780]  Wouldn't talk as a child.
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:23.581]  This is what all the eyewitnesses say when they are putting together the profile of this lone nut gunman.
[01:14:24.302 --> 01:14:25.402]  Is that he would never talk.
[01:14:25.982 --> 01:14:29.083]  And he wrote a very interesting play.
[01:14:29.483 --> 01:14:31.503]  I have the name for it somewhere here.
[01:14:35.905 --> 01:14:37.826]  Yeah, it's a funky name.
[01:14:38.167 --> 01:14:55.638]  I can add that to the discussion later, but apparently he had written a play about his stepfather molesting him and of course we know that this is all part of the compartmentalization, the fear that's used to drive somebody to multiple personalities so that they can be mind controlled.
[01:14:55.678 --> 01:15:00.681]  This is something that is persistent in every single mind control case.
[01:15:01.042 --> 01:15:04.244]  As I mentioned on our program yesterday, Secret Weapons, another book
[01:15:05.231 --> 01:15:12.537]  Where the military industrial complex and the CIA had used children to train them to be the ultimate warriors.
[01:15:12.937 --> 01:15:16.600]  Two case examples in a book called Secret Weapons.
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:22.204]  And then these are people who later on went on to describe things they should have never known about.
[01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:27.248]  Exact details and maps of government installations they had no business being in.
[01:15:27.348 --> 01:15:29.390]  And it's very very glaring in that case.
[01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:34.334]  But this is just one of the many consistencies that we see in mind control victims.
[01:15:34.794 --> 01:15:40.195]  Also, I know this is up at Infowars.com, CIA recruiting at Virginia Tech.
[01:15:41.135 --> 01:15:44.456]  The single shooter was unusually effective at killing.
[01:15:44.476 --> 01:15:50.117]  In fact, all the eyewitnesses saying that he looked trained, almost as if he'd been trained to do so.
[01:15:50.538 --> 01:15:56.859]  Again, for the second time this year, the Central Intelligence Agency will be coming to Virginia Tech to recruit students.
[01:15:57.742 --> 01:16:04.826]  And for the second time this year that we've met with protests from students who view the CIA as an immoral organization that engages in torture and murder.
[01:16:05.367 --> 01:16:09.069]  Nicholas Kiersey organized the protest last spring when the CIA came to campus.
[01:16:09.089 --> 01:16:15.593]  He released the following statement this Monday about the CIA's trip to Torgeston, 3100 Thursday at 7 p.m.
[01:16:15.653 --> 01:16:22.437]  Blacksburg, Virginia, November 13, 2005, Coalition of Concerned Graduate Students and Campus Organizers at Virginia Tech
[01:16:23.477 --> 01:16:28.420]  are staging a teach-in to protest the skull-and-bones CIA recruitment on campus.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.302]  So, of course, the CIA making their presence known.
[01:16:31.362 --> 01:16:34.564]  And then here is something else that's just very, very odd.
[01:16:35.264 --> 01:16:42.368]  The gunman's sister and a brother, both Princeton grads, a brother worked for the State Department.
[01:16:42.649 --> 01:16:50.173]  His sister, currently also a Princeton grad, works on an Iraqi aid team for the State House and directly under Condoleezza Rice.
[01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:54.532]  The sister of the gunman responsible for the deadliest shooting rampage in U.S.
[01:16:54.552 --> 01:17:01.776]  history works as a contractor for a State Department office that oversees billions of dollars in American aid for Iraq.
[01:17:02.557 --> 01:17:09.620]  Sun Kyung Cho is employed by the Iraqi Reconstruction Management Office according to U.S.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:15.784]  officials in a State Department staff directory that says she works from an annex near the department's headquarters in Washington.
[01:17:16.477 --> 01:17:22.985]  Messages left on her office voicemail, in which she identifies herself as Son Cho, were not immediately returned on Wednesday.
[01:17:23.025 --> 01:17:26.069]  The Virginia Tech gunman was her brother, Cho Swing He.
[01:17:26.089 --> 01:17:34.419]  33 people died in the rampage Monday, including a 23-year-old student who committed suicide, being Cho himself.
[01:17:35.299 --> 01:17:43.486]  Spokesman Sean McCormick declined to discuss Sancho's status, but told reporters this person is not a direct hire employee of the State Department.
[01:17:43.506 --> 01:17:55.936]  Again, meaning that she is a contractor for the State Department, working in one of the more nefarious parts of the Iraqi war, and that is the reconstruction of Iraq.
[01:17:55.956 --> 01:17:58.398]  And we've done just a ton of shows on that.
[01:17:59.702 --> 01:18:09.852]  The office was set up by President Bush to coordinate the reconstruction program in Iraq and offers jobs to highly skilled and motivated United States citizens to work at the U.S.
[01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:12.375]  Embassy in Baghdad, according to State Department documents.
[01:18:12.415 --> 01:18:19.682]  The office also has several Washington-based positions, so in a way, you could say that Cho's sister works
[01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:34.151]  In the office, directly set up by President Bush, monitored by Condoleezza Rice and John Negroponte, though she is a contractor, and we're getting more information exactly who she might be working for.
[01:18:34.191 --> 01:18:42.416]  But again, doesn't damn the situation, does not prove anything per se, but another very interesting piece of this puzzle.
[01:18:42.696 --> 01:18:44.217]  We'll take a quick break, we'll come right back.
[01:18:44.337 --> 01:18:47.879]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, I'm Jack Flood, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:18:47.899 --> 01:18:48.239]  Stay tuned.
[01:18:53.763 --> 01:18:58.265]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:18:58.605 --> 01:19:02.686]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:19:02.987 --> 01:19:03.527]  We listened.
[01:19:03.847 --> 01:19:08.829]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:19:09.109 --> 01:19:09.589]  We listened.
[01:19:09.969 --> 01:19:13.010]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.971]  We listened.
[01:19:14.431 --> 01:19:17.292]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[01:19:17.432 --> 01:19:18.113]  We're good to go.
[01:19:34.853 --> 01:19:37.494]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[01:19:37.694 --> 01:19:37.874]  Only $279.

[01:19:40.516 --> 01:19:41.476]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:52.483 --> 01:19:54.324]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:19:54.364 --> 01:19:54.565]  April 19, 2007.
[01:19:54.625 --> 01:19:55.225]  Gold is at $6.83.

[01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:13.451]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[01:20:13.531 --> 01:20:16.532]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[01:20:16.612 --> 01:20:25.694]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[01:20:26.014 --> 01:20:31.296]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[01:20:31.776 --> 01:20:34.058]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[01:20:34.118 --> 01:20:36.539]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[01:20:36.939 --> 01:20:40.221]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:20:40.301 --> 01:20:43.964]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[01:20:44.024 --> 01:20:44.304]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:44.324 --> 01:20:44.504]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:56.993]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:20:57.233 --> 01:20:58.994]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:20:59.254 --> 01:21:05.538]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:21:05.839 --> 01:21:11.943]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:21:12.203 --> 01:21:18.227]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:21:18.507 --> 01:21:24.911]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.

[01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:44.833]  Day after day
[01:23:02.176 --> 01:23:07.799]  Thank you for tuning into the Alex Jones Show today, folks.
[01:23:07.859 --> 01:23:10.340]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:22.546]  Alex will be joining us with a breaking news story here in just about 6, 7, 8 minutes, so stay tuned for that.
[01:23:33.139 --> 01:23:36.165]  I know we've gone through the show here almost 90 minutes.
[01:23:36.486 --> 01:23:37.848]  No promotion for the film.
[01:23:37.868 --> 01:23:39.752]  That really makes this car go.
[01:23:39.772 --> 01:23:40.334]  That's what...
[01:23:41.374 --> 01:23:45.597]  Keeps Alex, uh, his war chest full so that he can get out and do more and more.
[01:23:46.237 --> 01:23:48.879]  And, uh, I've watched him do this repeatedly over the years.
[01:23:49.259 --> 01:23:52.161]  Uh, there is a great special that you should know about.
[01:23:52.441 --> 01:23:55.923]  Two of the scariest films this year aren't slasher flicks.
[01:23:55.983 --> 01:24:00.166]  It's the true story about the terrifying police state being constructed all around us.
[01:24:00.206 --> 01:24:04.268]  So, uh, those two movies are Freedom to Fascism, Aaron Russo's great film.
[01:24:04.288 --> 01:24:06.850]  If you haven't seen that, if you don't have it, that is a must-have.
[01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:09.192]  And that really gets people thinking.
[01:24:09.232 --> 01:24:09.652]  If you've got
[01:24:10.072 --> 01:24:19.757]  People out there, your loved ones, family, co-workers, people in the street, your neighbors, and maybe they can't open their minds up to something as big as false flag terrorism or 9-11.
[01:24:19.777 --> 01:24:23.119]  Get them started with From Freedom to Fascism by Aaron Russo.
[01:24:23.139 --> 01:24:30.063]  But when you buy From Freedom to Fascism, you get Alex Jones' incredible movie Terror Storm, the DVD, for only $10.
[01:24:30.203 --> 01:24:34.865]  These are info weapons in this DVD combo pack.
[01:24:34.925 --> 01:24:35.846]  It's regularly about $40 now.
[01:24:36.906 --> 01:24:42.189]  It only costs $30, and the money goes back into fighting the InfoWars and defeating the New World Order.
[01:24:42.509 --> 01:24:49.633]  You can go to InfoWars.com, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com to find out how to get these, or you can call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:24:49.653 --> 01:24:49.693]  888-253-3139.
[01:24:54.876 --> 01:25:02.703]  253-3139, for my money, Terror Storm, one of the best films made about the history of false flag terror.
[01:25:02.743 --> 01:25:14.953]  So, if you have a hard time remembering all the facts, you have a hard time getting a grasp on the historical facts, the proof, the evidence, the documentation that there have been false flag terror events throughout our history,
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.203]  Get the movie Terror Storm, and that explains it all for you.
[01:25:19.223 --> 01:25:26.028]  Have sit-down parties, have screenings, show your people this film, and I guarantee you it will have an impact on them.
[01:25:26.048 --> 01:25:29.831]  Maybe not right away, but the seeds will certainly be planted.
[01:25:29.851 --> 01:25:31.652]  Those two films right now on special.
[01:25:31.692 --> 01:25:35.075]  Again, the toll-free number 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or go to Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com for more details.
[01:25:43.381 --> 01:25:49.066]  Quickly, I'd like to go over a list because pharmaceuticals seem to be involved in this.
[01:25:49.106 --> 01:25:55.691]  I saw a report today talking about how pharmaceutical companies are doing better than ever, making more profit than ever before.
[01:25:56.231 --> 01:25:58.353]  We covered a story about a month or two ago.
[01:25:58.393 --> 01:26:01.916]  The Carlyle Group, most of you are aware who they are, if not Google them.
[01:26:03.574 --> 01:26:25.688]  Which includes the members of the Bush family, members of the Windsor family, members of the Bin Laden family, investors from all over, Tony Blair said to be going to work for the Carlyle Group, George Tenet who's coming out with some kind of explosive book here very soon, probably not too explosive, also works for the Carlyle Group, but the Carlyle Group currently in negotiations to buy Merck's, what do you call it, the
[01:26:27.992 --> 01:26:28.793]  Pseudopill.
[01:26:28.833 --> 01:26:29.893]  What is the term for it?
[01:26:29.933 --> 01:26:31.334]  John, somebody help me out here.
[01:26:31.434 --> 01:26:32.374]  The Generics.
[01:26:32.755 --> 01:26:35.996]  That is the biggest generic drug company in the world.
[01:26:36.316 --> 01:26:39.538]  Wouldn't it be nice for the Carlisle Group to have their hands on that?
[01:26:40.437 --> 01:26:47.782]  That being said, here are just some of the instances of shootings and of deadly occurrences that involve prescription drugs and antidepressants.
[01:26:48.122 --> 01:26:51.124]  September 28, 2006, Bailey, Colorado.
[01:26:51.384 --> 01:26:58.028]  Dwayne Morrison, 53, entered Platte Canyon High School and shot and killed one girl and sexually assaulted six others.
[01:26:58.408 --> 01:27:00.229]  Antidepressants were found in his vehicle.
[01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:04.931]  March 21st, 2005, Red Lake Indian Reservation, Minnesota.
[01:27:04.951 --> 01:27:13.014]  16-year-old Native American Jeff Weiss was under the influence of the antidepressant Prozac when he shot and killed nine people, wounding five before committing suicide.
[01:27:13.294 --> 01:27:17.276]  April 10th, 2001, Wahluke, Washington.
[01:27:17.296 --> 01:27:29.501]  16-year-old Corey Blagsgard took a rifle to his high school, held 23 classmates and the teachers hostage while on a high dose of the antidepressant Effexor.
[01:27:30.763 --> 01:27:47.070]  March 22nd, that's 3-2-2, 2001, El Cajon, California, 18-year-old Jason Hoffman was on two antidepressants, that is again Effexor and Calexa, when he opened fire at his California high school, wounding five.
[01:27:47.370 --> 01:27:52.552]  March 7th, 2000, Williamsburg, Pennsylvania, 14-year-old Elizabeth Bush
[01:27:53.172 --> 01:28:00.194]  ...was on antidepressants Prozac when she blasted away at fellow students in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, wounding one.
[01:28:00.274 --> 01:28:05.155]  May 20th, 1999, Conyers, Georgia, 15-year-old T.J.
[01:28:05.235 --> 01:28:10.356]  Solomon was being treated with a mix of antidepressants when he opened fire and wounded six of his classmates.
[01:28:10.836 --> 01:28:17.698]  April 20th, 1999, Columbine, Colorado, 18-year-old Eric Harris was on the antidepressant Luvox.
[01:28:18.351 --> 01:28:23.674]  When he and his partner, Dylan Klebold, killed 12 classmates and a teacher, wounding 23 others before taking their own lives.
[01:28:23.694 --> 01:28:26.977]  It ended up until now, the bloodiest school massacre to date.
[01:28:27.637 --> 01:28:28.297]  April 16th, 1999.
[01:28:29.218 --> 01:28:30.819]  Novus, Idaho.
[01:28:30.839 --> 01:28:31.920]  15-year-old Sean Cooper.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.161]  Two shotgun rounds into his school.
[01:28:34.221 --> 01:28:34.962]  Missing students.
[01:28:35.382 --> 01:28:36.382]  A mix of antidepressants.
[01:28:36.402 --> 01:28:37.463]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:28:37.523 --> 01:28:38.104]  Folks, stay tuned.
[01:28:38.124 --> 01:28:39.364]  Alex Jones coming up right after this.
[01:28:41.866 --> 01:28:42.807]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.267 --> 01:28:44.788]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.769 --> 01:28:48.550]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.011 --> 01:28:54.952]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:28:55.112 --> 01:29:00.274]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:29:00.634 --> 01:29:05.936]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:29:06.317 --> 01:29:07.417]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:29:07.817 --> 01:29:16.903]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:29:17.143 --> 01:29:18.764]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:29:18.984 --> 01:29:27.830]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[01:29:32.032 --> 01:29:32.832]  Keep it natural.
[01:29:33.112 --> 01:29:41.295]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:29:41.536 --> 01:29:45.697]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:29:45.717 --> 01:29:46.637]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:29:51.698 --> 01:29:56.259]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:59.601]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:29:59.921 --> 01:30:02.481]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:30:02.842 --> 01:30:07.663]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:30:08.043 --> 01:30:13.425]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:30:13.725 --> 01:30:16.686]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[01:30:16.866 --> 01:30:18.407]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[01:30:19.527 --> 01:30:24.249]  Many people believe that this will be the Mark of the Beast because of the restrictive measures included.
[01:30:24.449 --> 01:30:28.570]  Which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:35.152]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the Mark of the Beast, it says, If any man worship the Beast, take notice.
[01:30:35.492 --> 01:30:37.113]  It says, Worship the Beast.
[01:30:37.393 --> 01:30:40.014]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[01:30:40.274 --> 01:30:45.742]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:30:45.762 --> 01:30:46.202]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:30:52.071 --> 01:30:52.591]  Hey, Emily!
[01:30:52.891 --> 01:30:53.791]  Wow, you look great!
[01:30:54.132 --> 01:30:54.932]  I feel great!
[01:30:55.172 --> 01:30:57.112]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:30:57.472 --> 01:30:57.772]  Really?
[01:30:58.012 --> 01:30:58.433]  What is it?
[01:30:58.573 --> 01:30:59.033]  How does it work?
[01:30:59.153 --> 01:31:05.614]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[01:31:05.714 --> 01:31:07.995]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:31:08.155 --> 01:31:13.276]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:31:13.596 --> 01:31:14.077]  That's it?
[01:31:14.317 --> 01:31:15.898]  Well it sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:31:16.098 --> 01:31:16.819]  It is easy.
[01:31:17.019 --> 01:31:23.664]  Plus the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:31:23.925 --> 01:31:25.266]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:31:25.466 --> 01:31:26.267]  That's amazing!
[01:31:26.587 --> 01:31:31.951]  And the benzenite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:31:32.192 --> 01:31:32.512]  Wow!
[01:31:32.692 --> 01:31:33.753]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[01:31:34.193 --> 01:31:37.215]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[01:31:37.295 --> 01:31:41.558]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[01:31:41.939 --> 01:31:44.641]  For only $26.90, MediCleanse is shipped directly to you.
[01:31:44.761 --> 01:31:45.141]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[01:31:45.161 --> 01:31:45.381]  That's 800-317-9547.
[01:32:05.007 --> 01:32:16.759]  On a lonely, lonesome highway, on the east of Omaha, I listen to the engine moanin' out his one old song.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:24.286]  I think about the woman, the girl you knew the night before.
[01:32:27.435 --> 01:32:28.316]  Thanks for tuning in.
[01:32:28.356 --> 01:32:30.257]  Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:32:30.337 --> 01:32:32.358]  I'm Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[01:32:32.398 --> 01:32:33.719]  We've got a lot of news to report.
[01:32:33.759 --> 01:32:36.921]  We're going to be taking your calls as well at 800-259-9231.
[01:32:37.001 --> 01:32:42.684]  Third hour coming up just after this, but I do have Alex on the line.
[01:32:42.984 --> 01:32:45.286]  Alex at an undisclosed location.
[01:32:45.566 --> 01:32:48.608]  The host of this very program, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:32:48.748 --> 01:32:50.389]  Alex, thank you for joining us on the show today.
[01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:52.770]  Jack, you make it sound all mysterious.
[01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:56.573]  I'm just taking a few days off every couple months down here at the Texas coast.
[01:32:56.653 --> 01:32:57.073]  We love it.
[01:32:57.501 --> 01:32:58.541]  But I am here working.
[01:32:58.641 --> 01:33:00.282]  I am here working with Paul Watson.
[01:33:00.782 --> 01:33:02.062]  We did write an article today.
[01:33:02.082 --> 01:33:03.882]  Paul did, of course, the lion's share of the work.
[01:33:04.562 --> 01:33:18.965]  Frankly, Paul, on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we were having big arguments about whether he could be a mind control slave, but then Paul did even more research, literally like eight hours of solid research yesterday, and now he's convinced that the guy basically is mind control.
[01:33:19.605 --> 01:33:20.926]  And, of course, I'm convinced.
[01:33:21.066 --> 01:33:22.926]  There are so many factors to this.
[01:33:23.775 --> 01:33:24.435]  I don't know.
[01:33:43.226 --> 01:33:59.951]  Deadly accuracy, disturbing revelations suggest outside involvement in Virginia Massacre, cocktail of brainwashing from Prozac, video games contributed to carnage, and notice that on Monday I said watch, he'll be on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, which is the Prozac family.
[01:34:00.931 --> 01:34:10.534]  He will be obsessed with shoot-em-up games, and he would have just gotten out of a psychiatric facility, and also we have confirmed
[01:34:11.292 --> 01:34:22.238]  Uh, that people who've written about mind control, not just, uh, Kathy O'Brien, but also we've talked to the wife of Spritz, Spritz Springmeier, who was set up, they were so upset at him.
[01:34:22.698 --> 01:34:24.239]  They've written about it and talked about it.
[01:34:24.299 --> 01:34:26.981]  Blacksburg is a key operation area.
[01:34:28.253 --> 01:34:40.517]  Also, I said on Monday, if NASA has a connection, if the Defense Department has a connection, that's another... Alex, I don't know if you heard this, because I read this on your program earlier.
[01:34:40.557 --> 01:34:42.377]  This is out of the mainstream media.
[01:34:42.457 --> 01:34:47.779]  Apparently, the same high school that Show went to, they had another shooter, Michael Kennedy, who went nuts with an AK-47.
[01:34:49.079 --> 01:34:59.062]  And according to the information we have, Westfield High School shares a complex with Northrop Grumman's Intelligence Group.
[01:34:59.783 --> 01:35:08.405]  And we noticed in Columbine, of course, remember the film Bowling for Columbine, we saw that Lockheed Martin pretty much had owned the town that Columbine High School was in.
[01:35:08.426 --> 01:35:09.166]  It's the same thing here.
[01:35:10.703 --> 01:35:11.583]  See, this is the problem.
[01:35:12.044 --> 01:35:13.124]  It's an orgy of evidence.
[01:35:13.324 --> 01:35:21.528]  We have hundreds of nexus points that I said Monday, okay, could be a nut, but if it fits A through Z, we know it's inside job.
[01:35:21.848 --> 01:35:22.608]  It's a pattern.
[01:35:23.449 --> 01:35:24.129]  It's an action.
[01:35:24.169 --> 01:35:28.331]  It's like somebody who's watched a football coach for 20 years knows what he's going to call.
[01:35:28.351 --> 01:35:38.096]  You know, if you eat, breathe, and sleep this, you know when they line up a certain way and the coach has got a certain look on his face and gives a certain hand signal, you know what they're doing.
[01:35:38.276 --> 01:35:38.936]  So listen, folks.
[01:35:39.813 --> 01:35:41.795]  Bottom line, it's cultural mind control.
[01:35:41.815 --> 01:35:44.418]  The government was running all these drills.
[01:35:44.478 --> 01:35:45.900]  They've had a shooting there before.
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:53.228]  Yesterday we confirmed from Matt Kazee, who lost one of his friends, another was wounded, that
[01:35:55.965 --> 01:36:02.809]  And he's now talked to him that the guy was going around mechanically, like a literal robot, pumping three shots.
[01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:06.731]  After he got you on the ground, he'd walk right up, shoot you in the back of the head.
[01:36:07.151 --> 01:36:15.676]  His friend lived because, even though he shot him in near point-blank range, it still deflected because a 9mm is not a hyper-velocity.
[01:36:15.876 --> 01:36:21.739]  That's why with a rifle round, it doesn't matter if he hits somebody at an angle, it's 95% of the time going to go into the skull.
[01:36:22.619 --> 01:36:27.282]  But that's not the case with these low power, and the 9mm, folks, is pretty much low power.
[01:36:27.682 --> 01:36:30.004]  It's a large round, but it doesn't have a lot of power behind it.
[01:36:30.044 --> 01:36:32.225]  But that's a side issue.
[01:36:32.245 --> 01:36:33.105]  Here's the problem.
[01:36:33.526 --> 01:36:41.230]  I mean, literally, as I was thinking about going on air beforehand, I didn't know where to start, but you just brought up that key point.
[01:36:41.370 --> 01:36:49.575]  Also, we learned two days ago that there were all these special NASA funding programs, and secret grants, and Defense Department grants,
[01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:57.784]  And that people were doing internships full-time at Laney at the CIA that is right down the road.
[01:36:59.001 --> 01:37:06.266]  Also, we know there are other secret NASA facilities and other secret... But then the schools started pulling permanent links.
[01:37:06.727 --> 01:37:13.232]  As we were already looking at this, they started, as we were looking at them, pulling and killing links and expunging.
[01:37:13.552 --> 01:37:22.939]  Now, and folks, this is... When they start expunging records of CIA and NASA... But people say, well, there's always going to be NASA and CIA colleges.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:23.980]  Uh-uh, folks.
[01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:26.302]  We have NASA connections at Columbine.
[01:37:26.702 --> 01:37:27.623]  It's the same story.
[01:37:27.643 --> 01:37:28.544]  They bring 120 plus bombs in.
[01:37:28.564 --> 01:37:29.685]  No one stops them.
[01:37:29.745 --> 01:37:31.166]  The school's over half empty.
[01:37:47.709 --> 01:37:49.891]  I mean, just to get into Columbine would take hours.
[01:37:50.011 --> 01:37:51.172]  Total blackout there.
[01:37:51.412 --> 01:37:54.434]  Students reporting other men in black masks running around.
[01:37:54.735 --> 01:37:57.177]  The SWAT team holds back four hours and 15 minutes.
[01:37:57.477 --> 01:38:05.243]  The feds are always in control, ordering people not to go in when it's a blackout because the local cops obviously are not part of it or in on it.
[01:38:05.643 --> 01:38:13.469]  Because of the previous shooting and federal drills with the Marine Corps, with the ROTC, with the Army, they were under federal control.
[01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:17.132]  Because when you get in trouble with one shooting, the feds come in and take control.
[01:38:17.753 --> 01:38:21.736]  We have confirmed now that it was from three separate people at the school.
[01:38:21.816 --> 01:38:24.919]  I talked to one of them yesterday on air, but I made phone calls again.
[01:38:25.599 --> 01:38:32.504]  Yesterday on this, that they were told to stand down, that they knew at 7.15 the shots had been made.
[01:38:32.764 --> 01:38:41.850]  Then this guy goes, makes videotapes, mails them to NBC, mails letters to the police to make sure that the feds have their official story out.
[01:38:42.210 --> 01:38:44.512]  This whole thing is off the charts.
[01:38:44.532 --> 01:38:54.078]  But even if you don't believe it's mind control, that is, you know, a manchurian candidate strapped down on a chair for six months, you know, at Laneling, which this is obviously, I mean, I bet my bottom dollar that's what this is.
[01:38:55.405 --> 01:39:00.568]  Well, look, I mean, here's something I also wanted to put on the record, and we talked about this a little bit.
[01:39:00.588 --> 01:39:04.451]  It's very, very interesting that he says he was molested by his stepfather.
[01:39:05.211 --> 01:39:09.294]  By the way, his real father made his fortune in Saudi Arabia.
[01:39:09.354 --> 01:39:14.737]  We're trying to figure out exactly if that might mean anything, but both his sister and his brother work for the State Department.
[01:39:14.777 --> 01:39:20.140]  He says he wrote this play called Richard McBeef, where he talks about being molested as a child.
[01:39:20.501 --> 01:39:22.602]  And we know they always do that in mind control.
[01:39:22.842 --> 01:39:31.624]  All of this seems to fit a pattern that he might have been, you know, mind-controlled, molested, coordinated, triggered very, very early on.
[01:39:31.644 --> 01:39:36.905]  And then you've got one other point here I want to mention because he lined up the people and told them that they wouldn't be hurt.
[01:39:36.945 --> 01:39:39.186]  He lined them up, of course, fearing for their lives.
[01:39:39.206 --> 01:39:42.087]  They did what they were told and they were picked off one by one.
[01:39:42.107 --> 01:39:44.967]  This is the exact same thing that happened in that Amish shooting.
[01:39:45.167 --> 01:39:47.308]  It's almost as if they're following the same playbook, Alex.
[01:39:47.688 --> 01:39:48.468]  Well, no, it is.
[01:39:48.768 --> 01:39:54.490]  And, again, for those that don't know, we're going to be posting up on PrisonPlanet.com another article later today.
[01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:57.831]  JonesReport.com has got massive coverage on this.
[01:39:57.851 --> 01:39:59.071]  Aaron's done a great job there.
[01:40:00.051 --> 01:40:10.654]  But, bottom line, even if you don't think he was strapped down in a facility and trained from the age of five, which, yes, every indicator, every point has been checked off,
[01:40:11.457 --> 01:40:13.639]  The government admits they've done this in the past.
[01:40:13.679 --> 01:40:15.840]  They have this perfected by the mid-60s.
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:19.783]  The Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski, L.A.
[01:40:19.883 --> 01:40:27.628]  Times admitted that he was for four years in a CIA mind-control program at Yale.
[01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:29.610]  I mean, look, pull that up.
[01:40:29.730 --> 01:40:31.891]  Folks, you cannot make this type of stuff up.
[01:40:31.931 --> 01:40:35.674]  We know McVeigh was in the same program.
[01:40:35.714 --> 01:40:36.775]  That's now been confirmed.
[01:40:37.275 --> 01:40:38.276]  So, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:40:39.190 --> 01:40:40.790]  Let's just say that's not the case, though.
[01:40:41.271 --> 01:40:43.631]  The cultural... We're all under mind control.
[01:40:43.651 --> 01:40:44.771]  The television, the culture.
[01:40:45.012 --> 01:40:51.633]  These shoot-em-up games put you into a lower level than natural brainwaves ever even function.
[01:40:51.673 --> 01:40:53.774]  It's below low-oxygen sleep.
[01:40:54.174 --> 01:40:55.814]  These are major scientific studies.
[01:40:56.114 --> 01:40:57.435]  They hook electrodes to people.
[01:40:57.655 --> 01:40:58.955]  It's because of the concentration.
[01:40:59.455 --> 01:41:00.596]  Four long periods of time.
[01:41:00.636 --> 01:41:01.916]  It gets into very complex reasons.
[01:41:02.276 --> 01:41:04.297]  That is literal mind control.
[01:41:04.538 --> 01:41:06.459]  That's what they do with real mind control.
[01:41:06.779 --> 01:41:09.781]  Classical, hardcore is what the drugs bring you down to that low level.
[01:41:10.041 --> 01:41:11.702]  And they put audio recordings into your head.
[01:41:12.163 --> 01:41:13.404]  This is visual.
[01:41:14.044 --> 01:41:15.765]  And I'm going to do shows on this when I get back.
[01:41:16.426 --> 01:41:18.227]  I'll do more research and get it all lined up.
[01:41:18.247 --> 01:41:19.107]  Maybe call in tomorrow.
[01:41:19.127 --> 01:41:20.008]  I'll certainly call in tomorrow.
[01:41:20.028 --> 01:41:22.550]  But on that, he's playing these violent games.
[01:41:22.890 --> 01:41:25.972]  He's on the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, Prozac class of drugs.
[01:41:26.502 --> 01:41:41.106]  Then, normally these people have been pre-trained, but they kind of get a tune-up, or a double-check, when they pull them into a government facility, they always pull them in, and then they're released, and then the carnage begins.
[01:41:41.446 --> 01:41:42.586]  And I said that on Monday.
[01:41:42.886 --> 01:41:44.166]  How did I know all this would happen?
[01:41:44.206 --> 01:41:51.088]  I said, if it's a black-off, you will see A to Z. We have now seen A to Z, and then some,
[01:41:52.003 --> 01:41:56.104]  With this situation, what you just mentioned earlier is absolutely key, Jack.
[01:41:56.144 --> 01:41:56.805]  This is so big.
[01:41:56.825 --> 01:41:59.425]  I mean, I don't even know how I'm going to stay out of town.
[01:41:59.725 --> 01:42:00.906]  I appreciate you doing the show.
[01:42:00.926 --> 01:42:02.126]  I'm definitely going to call in tomorrow.
[01:42:02.506 --> 01:42:03.847]  And I really appreciate you doing it.
[01:42:03.927 --> 01:42:05.507]  And I know everybody's doing a great job.
[01:42:05.907 --> 01:42:09.449]  It's just, this is so unbelievably obvious.
[01:42:09.529 --> 01:42:12.429]  So, bottom line, the culture brainwashed this guy.
[01:42:12.690 --> 01:42:15.490]  The government blocked the people from protecting themselves.
[01:42:17.571 --> 01:42:18.872]  And, think about this.
[01:42:19.012 --> 01:42:20.132]  New Freedom Initiative.
[01:42:21.068 --> 01:42:43.082]  The New Freedom Initiative ragged that 15% of kids are on these drugs now, that within five years of having New Freedom in, and remember this got leaked in Pennsylvania and Ohio by people involved with it who didn't like it, that New Freedom was written up by the drug companies to put half the kids in the next phase
[01:42:43.482 --> 01:42:43.802]  I don't know.
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:07.940]  Re-uptake inhibitors.
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:11.781]  I just read a list of school shootings and otherwise public shootings.
[01:43:11.841 --> 01:43:18.763]  I think we ended up with about 10 or 11 of them before we went to break all of them on these psychotropic antidepressants.
[01:43:19.703 --> 01:43:20.463]  You're absolutely right.
[01:43:20.663 --> 01:43:21.964]  They are classified.
[01:43:22.284 --> 01:43:25.224]  Okay, you can just type in Prozac, Zoloft.
[01:43:25.925 --> 01:43:29.826]  Type in... it's... it's... I forget the term.
[01:43:31.146 --> 01:43:31.606]  You know, type...
[01:43:32.782 --> 01:43:49.767]  Type in for its adverse reactions sheet, and they have to admit in there that, and it shows the molecule on that sheet that comes with it, it says now, it increases suicide, but it's classed as a psychotropic hallucinogen psychoactive.
[01:43:49.847 --> 01:43:57.550]  It puts you into a dream state, then you play these violent games, you might as well be at Langley, scrapped up, doing this.
[01:43:58.041 --> 01:44:00.022]  You literally, I mean, I've talked to cops.
[01:44:00.042 --> 01:44:05.264]  You pull up and there's a woman who's a realtor, makes a million bucks a year, dancing around naked with butcher knives.
[01:44:05.684 --> 01:44:10.186]  You know, this is like 10 years ago in Austin, cutting herself on Prozac.
[01:44:10.266 --> 01:44:11.426]  And the cops always know.
[01:44:11.966 --> 01:44:13.107]  This wasn't seen.
[01:44:13.587 --> 01:44:15.728]  This is LSD, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:15.928 --> 01:44:19.929]  But LSD goes across, brain-wide, in all of your senses.
[01:44:20.730 --> 01:44:23.851]  It's not even stronger, it just is harder for you to operate.
[01:44:24.272 --> 01:44:27.636]  When you're on the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, of course you're happy.
[01:44:27.656 --> 01:44:33.021]  You're on a hallucinogen 24 hours a day in a dream state.
[01:44:33.341 --> 01:44:39.227]  These drugs were actually developed by the CIA in the 60s and 70s and then passed on to private industry.
[01:44:39.728 --> 01:44:47.516]  Their history is in mind control and we've got almost 15% of the population now on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[01:44:47.997 --> 01:44:49.961]  A woman's got menstrual problems, go on it.
[01:44:50.482 --> 01:44:52.686]  Somebody wrecks their car, got a hurt neck, go on it.
[01:44:52.947 --> 01:44:55.011]  Probes got post-traumatic stress, go on it.
[01:44:55.332 --> 01:44:56.535]  We're going to see more and more.
[01:44:56.555 --> 01:44:57.497]  So what I'm saying is...
[01:44:58.439 --> 01:45:07.943]  It's possible with these drugs, just through programming and subliminals on television and these video games where you simulate tens of thousands of murders a week when they play these things four or five hours a day.
[01:45:08.283 --> 01:45:16.686]  Some people die at the video games after two, three days, you know, twenty year olds, because they're so locked in, it literally takes control of them.
[01:45:16.906 --> 01:45:18.707]  So they're mass drugging, mass programming.
[01:45:18.727 --> 01:45:20.608]  But with him, it is clear.
[01:45:21.403 --> 01:45:27.104]  We have military experts going public, top shooting experts going public, saying this is commando precision.
[01:45:27.244 --> 01:45:28.845]  Even the games couldn't do that.
[01:45:28.905 --> 01:45:30.645]  You mentioned the State Department parents.
[01:45:31.265 --> 01:45:33.706]  There's all this weird NASA funding at the school.
[01:45:33.946 --> 01:45:37.707]  They had Marines running around doing drills yesterday at the school again.
[01:45:38.467 --> 01:45:46.788]  Matt Kazee, who needs to call into the show if he's listening, he went up and asked the cops, and the cops said, oh, they're just having some fun.
[01:45:47.169 --> 01:45:47.869]  What was his word?
[01:45:50.588 --> 01:45:51.909]  Horseplaying or something like that.
[01:45:52.189 --> 01:45:57.770]  So, so, so, you know, that's the type of... The first email says it's an unfortunate accident.
[01:45:57.790 --> 01:46:00.471]  I mean, it reminds me of the North Tower, Tower 1 and 9-11.
[01:46:00.811 --> 01:46:11.575]  They had prior knowledge of this because of the bombing threats, which, coincidentally enough, were the threats directly on where the main shootings took place, so they should have been running over there and had that secure in the first place.
[01:46:11.995 --> 01:46:15.139]  There was a stand-down order as I recorded off the TV, Alex.
[01:46:15.419 --> 01:46:24.470]  Here's the spokesman for the police saying that someone, some unidentified source, told them the building was secure and that the shooter had been apprehended.
[01:46:24.490 --> 01:46:27.593]  This, of course, stopped the police from doing further action.
[01:46:28.254 --> 01:46:31.375]  Police who would jump in and rescue these children.
[01:46:31.435 --> 01:46:38.198]  I mean it seems like, and then of course you have the people jumping out the windows, reminiscent again of 9-11, to trigger that fear-based mind-controlling people.
[01:46:38.398 --> 01:46:45.620]  With cost-benefit analysis, we've got the 9-11 references, we've got all of the prior knowledge, the stand-downs, everything involved in 9-11.
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:52.963]  We've got of course gun control, even McCain and Kucinich on both sides of the aisle, coming out and saying we must have gun control, as we just talked about.
[01:46:53.263 --> 01:46:58.167]  Anyone displaying mental problems or antisocial behavior will be put through the ringer.
[01:46:58.428 --> 01:47:03.872]  Teenscreen parents will be shown this video of Cho from NBC.
[01:47:04.473 --> 01:47:06.795]  What happens to kids who don't get all this medication?
[01:47:06.835 --> 01:47:08.336]  So, cost-benefit analysis.
[01:47:08.656 --> 01:47:09.077]  Exactly.
[01:47:09.157 --> 01:47:17.504]  This has, just like they said 9-11 was for a new beginning, a new foundation, to launch the endless war on terror, they use key events
[01:47:18.424 --> 01:47:35.348]  They use the provocateur riots in Seattle to then have free speech zones, issue federally funded Darth Vader outfits literally to all the police to set up this new attack on free speech and to set the president to attack any peaceful demonstrations in 1999.
[01:47:35.488 --> 01:47:36.748]  I saw that before it happened.
[01:47:37.149 --> 01:47:38.449]  This is a black op.
[01:47:38.489 --> 01:47:39.029]  Here's the deal.
[01:47:39.764 --> 01:47:41.084]  They're pulling NASA links.
[01:47:41.304 --> 01:47:43.105]  They're pulling Lanley CIA links.
[01:47:43.225 --> 01:47:44.065]  They're pulling them.
[01:47:44.465 --> 01:47:51.988]  They have pulled photos of this guy, of the shooter, in his Marine Corps uniform with other ROTC Marines.
[01:47:52.348 --> 01:47:54.949]  He is, as you said, State Department parent.
[01:47:55.049 --> 01:47:56.089]  Folks, it's over.
[01:47:56.349 --> 01:47:58.250]  This is total black-off.
[01:47:58.490 --> 01:48:01.190]  And now they've got the same Marines running around.
[01:48:01.210 --> 01:48:02.831]  I would imagine the
[01:48:03.391 --> 01:48:05.993]  That there may be more shootings from these people.
[01:48:06.233 --> 01:48:08.574]  It'll probably come out of that Marine ROTC.
[01:48:08.854 --> 01:48:10.796]  And when it happens, it won't even be on the news.
[01:48:10.856 --> 01:48:12.216]  It's ROTC Marines!
[01:48:12.997 --> 01:48:17.500]  And of course, we have one other front here where the establishment is trying to benefit.
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:24.484]  And we have the desperate neocons trying to use Ismail Axe to refer that he could have been potentially Muslim or linked to terrorism.
[01:48:24.764 --> 01:48:25.224]  Absolutely.
[01:48:25.264 --> 01:48:27.846]  And Jack, we have the photo that Wikipedia pulled
[01:48:28.426 --> 01:48:33.429]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com, everybody's got to go get this headline story, get it out to everyone.
[01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:37.391]  The headline, the shooter, ladies and gentlemen, is a mind control slave.
[01:48:37.831 --> 01:48:45.175]  Either way you cut it, the whole culture is coming under mind control, but this guy is a hardcore mind control slave.
[01:48:45.536 --> 01:48:46.716]  He fits everything.
[01:48:46.836 --> 01:48:47.997]  This is a royal flush.
[01:48:48.971 --> 01:48:53.017]  And by that, a full house would prove he was a mind-control slave.
[01:48:53.238 --> 01:49:00.588]  This is a royal flush, you know, one out of fifty-something thousand for every indicator, every piece of the puzzle.
[01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:01.750]  It's always the same.
[01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:04.214]  The parents are always in high-level secret government ops.
[01:49:04.594 --> 01:49:06.615]  There's always weird NASA connections.
[01:49:06.915 --> 01:49:08.695]  There's always weird training.
[01:49:08.915 --> 01:49:10.156]  There's always thrills.
[01:49:10.376 --> 01:49:12.576]  The police always stand down for hours.
[01:49:12.936 --> 01:49:14.917]  This is a black off.
[01:49:14.977 --> 01:49:19.278]  Everybody's got to go to PrisonPlanet.com because we've got to get this out to the people.
[01:49:19.318 --> 01:49:20.819]  The proof that it's mind control.
[01:49:20.879 --> 01:49:24.500]  If it goes viral, we can do this and try to back off their gun control.
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:31.221]  But I knew Monday and Tuesday when I saw Fox News calling for gun control that we are in for the fight of our lives on the Second Amendment.
[01:49:31.241 --> 01:49:33.222]  And if they get the guns, folks, they're going to go ahead.
[01:49:33.682 --> 01:49:41.989]  Well, Alex, and there's one more element to this as well, yet one more element, and you feature this in your movie, Order of Death, the human sacrifice, child human sacrifice.
[01:49:42.209 --> 01:49:48.294]  We know that that's what the elite like to do, and in a situation like this, they've got to be, well, quite proud of themselves.
[01:49:49.275 --> 01:49:50.256]  Alex, stay with us if you can.
[01:49:50.296 --> 01:49:50.977]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:50:00.565]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:00.965 --> 01:50:08.592]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.289 --> 01:50:16.351]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:16.752 --> 01:50:28.175]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.475 --> 01:50:31.937]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:32.437 --> 01:50:34.377]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:34.718 --> 01:50:38.479]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:51.716 --> 01:50:54.738]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:55.038 --> 01:50:59.981]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:00.221 --> 01:51:04.583]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:04.884 --> 01:51:13.789]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:13.989 --> 01:51:17.611]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:17.891 --> 01:51:22.941]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:23.241 --> 01:51:29.934]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:30.453 --> 01:51:31.094]  What about you?
[01:51:31.734 --> 01:51:37.098]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:51:51.678 --> 01:51:53.399]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:53.619 --> 01:51:57.321]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:57.642 --> 01:51:59.863]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:52:00.363 --> 01:52:06.567]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:06.727 --> 01:52:11.590]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:20.861]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[01:52:21.181 --> 01:52:27.208]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[01:52:54.282 --> 01:52:55.884]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:52:56.004 --> 01:52:57.465]  It's an honor for me to do so.
[01:53:18.673 --> 01:53:22.634]  I told Alex the other day, this show's his baby, it's my baby too.
[01:53:22.674 --> 01:53:25.135]  I've been listening to it for many, many years, like so many of you have.
[01:53:25.575 --> 01:53:26.775]  Alex is still on the line with us.
[01:53:26.875 --> 01:53:31.676]  Alex, you wanted to touch on the NBC getting this video as we talked off air.
[01:53:31.696 --> 01:53:41.398]  I mean, GE, they're the biggest military-industrial-complex TV network out there, GE owning NBC, and of course, the military-industrial-complex's fingerprints all over this thing.
[01:53:41.638 --> 01:53:43.779]  I don't know if that's just another one of these coincidences, Alex.
[01:53:44.398 --> 01:53:50.101]  Well, I mean, they know and it's an absolute fact that, again, this is an example of mass mind control.
[01:53:50.582 --> 01:53:53.183]  You've got the mass mind control, which is very effective.
[01:53:53.543 --> 01:53:58.026]  Suggestion, like a magician or like someone hypnotizing you.
[01:53:58.306 --> 01:54:04.070]  You've got all these millions of young teenagers that literally play over, the average is over six hours.
[01:54:04.330 --> 01:54:06.031]  Their favorites are these shoot-em-up games.
[01:54:06.531 --> 01:54:12.774]  His favorite game was a black ops game where you're the US government going in and murdering and killing people.
[01:54:13.175 --> 01:54:15.896]  Again, some of these games are put out by the Defense Department.
[01:54:15.936 --> 01:54:25.621]  These games were developed to create instinctive shooting and unconscious firing up close because of inhibitions to fire on soldiers when you can see the whites of their eyes.
[01:54:26.461 --> 01:54:28.322]  You know, back in World War II, only half would fire.
[01:54:28.622 --> 01:54:34.926]  Vietnam was about only 30% wouldn't fire, and now they've got over 95%, and they train them on kill simulators.
[01:54:35.266 --> 01:54:37.607]  Just like they have flight simulators, they have kill simulators.
[01:54:37.987 --> 01:54:42.410]  Now NBC knows this, so they take these videos, which that's why there had to be the space.
[01:54:42.450 --> 01:54:50.554]  He had to be able to go to the killing, then make his videos, go send them in, NBC puts them on, and all these youth are going to see this, and I predict,
[01:54:50.925 --> 01:54:55.010]  You're going to have in the next two weeks, it'll take a while for these kids to become activated and do it.
[01:54:55.851 --> 01:55:07.684]  They'll probably hit daycares, they're probably going to hit, because they really know, images of dead toddlers will really get, you know like Operation Northwood says that by killing young people it'll cause a helpful wave of national indignation.
[01:55:08.414 --> 01:55:08.735]  I think?
[01:55:26.337 --> 01:55:38.276]  We know that the beltway sniper, and that would take hours because of the evidence, we know that was an inside job, we know that that was, again, this army guy, been in weird psychiatric care, then he gets some runaway kid.
[01:55:38.783 --> 01:55:50.697]  I mean, those guys at the Thousand Yard Stare, it's folks, this is a huge Pentagon operation with these tortured, brainwashed people, and in some cases it takes two years to make the perfect mind control slave.
[01:55:50.977 --> 01:55:55.863]  These people have been through living hell, and they march in there and they're told the pain goes away.
[01:55:55.883 --> 01:55:59.347]  They could make these people go into agony pain with a word.
[01:56:00.083 --> 01:56:08.165]  After over a year of drugging and torture, I mean the stuff that's come out of what they do, the electronics, and this is 50s and 60s technology.
[01:56:08.445 --> 01:56:10.565]  God only knows what they've got now.
[01:56:11.465 --> 01:56:17.487]  But the key here is... Well, they'll be getting some Carlisle Group cameras put up in all the schools here pretty soon.
[01:56:17.527 --> 01:56:28.929]  And let's not forget, there's yet another point and level to all of this, because gun control, of course, one of the key debates now, is probably one of the more like abortion, and we've seen there's news of abortion in the Supreme Court,
[01:56:29.529 --> 01:56:31.110]  Uh, canceling out late-term abortions.
[01:56:31.130 --> 01:56:36.914]  I mean, these are the two of the most, uh, distracting, uh, dividing issues in the country today.
[01:56:36.954 --> 01:56:39.696]  And that keeps everybody arguing against each other.
[01:56:39.716 --> 01:56:42.418]  And I'm not saying that I'm certainly not for gun control.
[01:56:42.458 --> 01:56:43.899]  I'm certainly not for abortion.
[01:56:43.919 --> 01:56:45.319]  That's my own personal opinion.
[01:56:45.359 --> 01:56:47.721]  Now I'll get letters and calls about that, Alex.
[01:56:47.761 --> 01:56:49.822]  I mean, this is a very divisive issue.
[01:56:50.083 --> 01:56:53.745]  They know if they put this on the plate for the American people, they'll lap it up.
[01:56:54.301 --> 01:56:57.563]  Yeah, and then we'll have to defend it and the gun grabbers will come after us.
[01:56:57.623 --> 01:57:02.127]  So, they're going to call to make all the colleges little prisons like the public schools.
[01:57:02.907 --> 01:57:05.009]  They're going to put cameras up in them.
[01:57:05.029 --> 01:57:06.590]  They're going to make everybody have ID cards.
[01:57:07.290 --> 01:57:10.853]  The FBI said they want checkpoints to go in shopping malls.
[01:57:11.273 --> 01:57:15.116]  This is the new, but the border will stay wide open and the illegals get bank accounts without IDs.
[01:57:15.936 --> 01:57:24.038]  Alex, why don't you stay for the five quick segment we have coming up in just about 70 seconds after this top-of-the-hour break, and then we'll let you go enjoy yourself.
[01:57:24.078 --> 01:57:25.238]  We'll take calls from your listeners.
[01:57:25.258 --> 01:57:25.738]  Can you do that?
[01:57:26.118 --> 01:57:26.318]  Sure.
[01:57:26.538 --> 01:57:26.758]  All right.
[01:57:26.778 --> 01:57:27.539]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:57:27.579 --> 01:57:29.099]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:29.119 --> 01:57:29.519]  Stay tuned.
[01:57:31.619 --> 01:57:36.500]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:48.330 --> 01:57:48.971]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.631 --> 01:57:50.692]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.392 --> 01:57:52.513]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.174 --> 01:57:53.974]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.735 --> 01:57:55.656]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.316 --> 01:57:59.959]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.479 --> 01:58:04.543]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.131 --> 01:58:10.835]  Well, I am live from Austin, Texas, deep behind enemy lines.
[01:58:10.895 --> 01:58:13.097]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.178 --> 01:58:19.484]  This is the Alex Jones Show, the Genesis Communications Radio Network, your first source for alternative news.
[01:58:19.604 --> 01:58:20.946]  Alex Jones joins us here
[01:58:22.034 --> 01:58:30.600]  On the program, we are breaking down more yet more information, more levels to this Virginia Tech school shooting and we'll come back after this next break.
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:34.683]  Go right to your calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:58:35.023 --> 01:58:38.906]  Alex, what a crazy week this is, adding in the Columbine anniversary.
[01:58:38.986 --> 01:58:41.528]  Now this Virginia Tech anniversary, of course, we've got
[01:58:42.743 --> 01:58:45.824]  The Oklahoma City bombing and Waco anniversaries are today.
[01:58:45.884 --> 01:58:48.445]  Normally that's what we would be talking about on our program.
[01:58:48.465 --> 01:58:53.847]  And then you've got the gold standard in 1933 was removed on this day.
[01:58:54.147 --> 01:58:57.988]  Pope Ratzinger was approved on this day just a year or two ago.
[01:58:58.048 --> 01:59:01.949]  And of course the Revolutionary War in 1775 started on this day.
[01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:03.310]  And it's Patriots Day.
[01:59:03.390 --> 01:59:04.550]  Let's not forget that today.
[01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.351]  That's right.
[01:59:05.371 --> 01:59:07.292]  They came to the guns in Leicester and Concord.
[01:59:07.693 --> 01:59:09.354]  But just recapping the key here.
[01:59:09.555 --> 01:59:11.276]  No doubt he's a mind control assassin.
[01:59:11.376 --> 01:59:13.478]  I don't mean brainwashed by the culture.
[01:59:14.119 --> 01:59:15.300]  I mean we have the evidence.
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:17.602]  Paul's going to be adding to the story all day.
[01:59:17.943 --> 01:59:19.484]  There is too much evidence of this.
[01:59:19.584 --> 01:59:24.429]  We know, we already heard this from local students, that he was involved in that ROTC.
[01:59:24.689 --> 01:59:26.211]  That he was involved with the military.
[01:59:26.431 --> 01:59:29.434]  We know that school has big programs with internships.
[01:59:29.898 --> 01:59:31.601]  All over the CIA and NASA.
[01:59:31.961 --> 01:59:35.327]  NASA is really over Space Command and the whole shadow government.
[01:59:35.707 --> 01:59:38.331]  Space Command, ladies and gentlemen, runs the entire military.
[01:59:38.371 --> 01:59:39.774]  The average American doesn't even know that.
[01:59:40.074 --> 01:59:41.596]  Doesn't even know what the uniforms look like.
[01:59:41.616 --> 01:59:42.598]  Doesn't even know any of that.
[01:59:43.159 --> 01:59:43.840]  Look into it.
[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:45.162]  It's always in these towns.
[01:59:45.795 --> 01:59:50.398]  Uh, it's, uh, Lockheed Martin, all these people are taking over the red light cameras, the surveillance.
[01:59:50.959 --> 01:59:57.944]  MIT Magazine admits that the cameras and the national ID cards and all this is a Pentagon-MIT designed, quote, control grid.
[01:59:58.384 --> 02:00:02.247]  That's why I use that term to map everything we do with the RFID.
[02:00:02.567 --> 02:00:06.850]  They're going to use this now for a reign of terror, searching everyone, metal detectors.
[02:00:07.410 --> 02:00:08.791]  Everything's going to be like a prison.
[02:00:08.811 --> 02:00:17.455]  Now they're going to have the Viper teams on the subways, on the trains, on the buses, on the highways, but again, the cops are on my way down to the beach.
[02:00:18.676 --> 02:00:21.277]  I saw 21 state police just on 37.
[02:00:21.857 --> 02:00:24.238]  Okay, I've been coming down here since I was a little kid.
[02:00:24.398 --> 02:00:26.179]  Every time I drive, it's more police cars.
[02:00:26.579 --> 02:00:30.802]  Now they pull you over if you're going three miles over the speed limit, but our borders are wide open.
[02:00:30.862 --> 02:00:32.262]  Trillions are missing from the Pentagon.
[02:00:32.502 --> 02:00:33.603]  Let me read to people what
[02:00:34.392 --> 02:00:40.182]  Folks said about our article saying that Mr. Chao was a mind control assassin up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:40.243 --> 02:00:40.964]  Please get it, folks.
[02:00:41.903 --> 02:00:46.524]  No doubt, the timing, the coincidence, the inconsistencies, the obvious facts, government black ops as usual.
[02:00:46.944 --> 02:00:56.167]  And it says it's the picture of him in the marine uniform that makes me wonder, along with the fact that only he had the guns for a month, but used them and acted like an accomplished assassin.
[02:00:56.627 --> 02:01:08.870]  The sheeple believe that burning jet fuel pulverized concrete, so I'm sure this won't blanket the MS Media story, or some untrained college student just buying a gun last month and shooting and reloading with
[02:01:09.310 --> 02:01:09.890]  Accuracy.
[02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:15.893]  It goes on with people saying that, you know, police officers, you know, can't even shoot this good after years of training.
[02:01:16.253 --> 02:01:18.374]  Also, the timing people, always April.
[02:01:18.654 --> 02:01:21.035]  Humanity never needed a video game to do horrible things.
[02:01:21.615 --> 02:01:23.936]  One guy's mad that we're saying that this happened.
[02:01:24.396 --> 02:01:24.716]  Sorry.
[02:01:25.156 --> 02:01:29.538]  All the studies show that it disassociates it and enable people to do this, folks.
[02:01:29.578 --> 02:01:31.499]  I'm not saying that you ban them.
[02:01:31.519 --> 02:01:32.479]  I'm just saying be aware of it.
[02:01:33.524 --> 02:01:40.212]  It goes on to say it's a documented fact that certain groups from the CIA, the DOD, and other government agencies have experimented on unknown citizens.
[02:01:40.252 --> 02:01:44.837]  This article includes LSD, atomic bomb, radiation, poison, etc.
[02:01:45.178 --> 02:01:48.942]  This very real possibility that he was some type of man-sharing candidate exists.
[02:01:49.306 --> 02:01:51.849]  Of course, the government won't admit a thing.
[02:01:51.869 --> 02:01:52.830]  100% accuracy, also.
[02:01:53.130 --> 02:01:59.556]  If you're watching the mainstream media coverage, or if you see the same pattern of 9-11, consistent parroting of the same story.
[02:01:59.757 --> 02:02:00.077]  That's it.
[02:02:00.117 --> 02:02:07.084]  They were already on script, day one, with the graphics, unified, all these leaders coming on and saying, we've got to do something.
[02:02:07.916 --> 02:02:10.478]  It goes on to say, no way, you only have the guns for a month.
[02:02:10.538 --> 02:02:16.741]  If Americans weren't so afraid of guns, they'd know that you don't just pick up a gun and shoot and reload with accuracy unless you've been trained.
[02:02:16.761 --> 02:02:19.623]  Most police officers can't even shoot with this type of precision.
[02:02:20.223 --> 02:02:23.705]  And we've got gun experts up there showing that, and people that train police.
[02:02:24.586 --> 02:02:28.028]  We're running out of time, Alex.
[02:02:28.128 --> 02:02:29.569]  You want to hang over for one more segment?
[02:02:29.609 --> 02:02:31.510]  Just a minute or two, because I want you to be able to get to the calls.
[02:02:32.537 --> 02:02:33.798]  This is the Alex Jones Show, folks.
[02:02:33.938 --> 02:02:38.139]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com with all these new articles on this breaking news story.
[02:02:38.179 --> 02:02:38.860]  Go there now.
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:40.120]  Send this out to your list.
[02:02:40.140 --> 02:02:41.261]  We'll be right back after this, folks.
[02:02:41.281 --> 02:02:43.382]  Stay tuned.
[02:02:44.102 --> 02:02:47.543]  It's here.
[02:02:47.724 --> 02:02:52.506]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:52.866 --> 02:03:00.469]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:01.198 --> 02:03:08.242]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:08.643 --> 02:03:20.130]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:23.972]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:24.332 --> 02:03:26.253]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:26.613 --> 02:03:30.476]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:49.261 --> 02:03:54.705]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:03:54.725 --> 02:03:59.029]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:03:59.369 --> 02:04:02.391]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:04:02.691 --> 02:04:06.134]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:04:06.454 --> 02:04:15.798]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:04:16.058 --> 02:04:19.559]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:04:19.799 --> 02:04:26.922]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:04:44.830 --> 02:04:50.253]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:04:50.694 --> 02:04:55.436]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:04:55.816 --> 02:04:58.458]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:04:58.938 --> 02:05:02.280]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:05:03.098 --> 02:05:07.440]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:05:07.861 --> 02:05:11.042]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:05:11.662 --> 02:05:14.504]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:05:15.265 --> 02:05:17.426]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:17.466 --> 02:05:19.566]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:05:19.586 --> 02:05:19.926]  U.S.
[02:05:19.986 --> 02:05:21.647]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[02:05:21.667 --> 02:05:21.967]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:05:21.987 --> 02:05:22.847]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:05:22.867 --> 02:05:23.407]  Ask for George.
[02:05:43.743 --> 02:05:51.468]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:51.488 --> 02:05:56.911]  That's exactly right, folks.
[02:05:57.011 --> 02:05:58.411]  It is a war for your mind.
[02:05:58.492 --> 02:06:00.092]  You can protect yourself.
[02:06:00.653 --> 02:06:02.334]  The information can empower you.
[02:06:02.394 --> 02:06:05.656]  And as I like to say, we can set the truth free.
[02:06:06.116 --> 02:06:07.657]  That's why you listen to this radio network.
[02:06:07.677 --> 02:06:09.958]  Of course, this is the Genesis Communications Network.
[02:06:10.018 --> 02:06:12.760]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones, who's on the line with us now.
[02:06:14.111 --> 02:06:27.913]  Alex, boy, I'll tell you, there are so many, there's so much information to this, so many levels to this, I would think you could probably do about two documentary films on this very subject, including talking about Operation Bluebird or Artichoke, whatever they call it now.
[02:06:27.953 --> 02:06:32.634]  I mean, there is just so many levels to this, and I think that we've got to call a spade a spade here.
[02:06:33.094 --> 02:06:38.255]  Well, I do plan to make a film after the next one on black ops, Kennedy through mass shootings.
[02:06:38.295 --> 02:06:43.176]  That was actually one of the films that I had on the back burner, and I've been collating, creating files, documents,
[02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:48.769]  Getting ready for an endgame is completed, but I'm now taking on some other projects too, so I don't know when that will get done.
[02:06:49.130 --> 02:06:50.653]  Or if the country will even be here then.
[02:06:51.054 --> 02:06:52.296]  But let me just recap things.
[02:06:52.316 --> 02:06:53.658]  I'm going to get out of here so you can take calls.
[02:06:53.759 --> 02:06:56.323]  I'm going to listen to you on the radio.
[02:06:57.233 --> 02:06:58.214]  I'm listening over shortwave.
[02:06:58.534 --> 02:07:00.275]  Here with my shortwave radio down at the Texas beach.
[02:07:00.295 --> 02:07:01.116]  I got to leave town.
[02:07:01.136 --> 02:07:01.997]  I never spent time with my family.
[02:07:02.017 --> 02:07:02.958]  Are you using a Kato?
[02:07:02.978 --> 02:07:04.519]  Those Kato radios are amazing.
[02:07:04.539 --> 02:07:06.480]  Do you still offer those at your website?
[02:07:06.661 --> 02:07:07.121]  Yes, we do.
[02:07:07.341 --> 02:07:08.182]  I love those.
[02:07:08.262 --> 02:07:08.782]  And you know what?
[02:07:08.802 --> 02:07:13.106]  You can get multiple micro radio stations on those as well, as well as shortwave.
[02:07:13.146 --> 02:07:14.227]  I recommend those to everybody.
[02:07:14.247 --> 02:07:14.707]  Go ahead, Alex.
[02:07:15.428 --> 02:07:19.831]  No, it's a fantastic radio, but I'm going to go back on the beach in a minute and listen to you.
[02:07:19.851 --> 02:07:21.853]  But to make a long story short here,
[02:07:23.465 --> 02:07:25.686]  They know these big catalyzing events.
[02:07:25.866 --> 02:07:28.307]  Picture society as rigid steel.
[02:07:29.167 --> 02:07:42.551]  But when they have a 9-11 or they have a mass shooting like this, they blow it way out of proportion, they make everybody feel like they're threatened, they put us in threat mode, and they heat the steel up to a liquid so they can change it and reform it like they want.
[02:07:43.505 --> 02:07:50.754]  And then it'll take us ten years to change people's minds and reprogram them, whereas in just a few weeks, they'll put out the official story.
[02:07:50.834 --> 02:07:51.695]  Now is the fight.
[02:07:52.156 --> 02:07:53.277]  I'm seeing signs.
[02:07:53.497 --> 02:07:56.060]  I don't think we're winning, but at least we're in the fight.
[02:07:56.100 --> 02:08:00.025]  In the past, they could just put out whatever official story and that was the facts.
[02:08:01.172 --> 02:08:02.974]  I'm seeing here that we're having an effect.
[02:08:03.054 --> 02:08:05.495]  Lots of talk about how the victims were disarmed.
[02:08:05.876 --> 02:08:08.318]  Lots of talk about how the police can't protect you.
[02:08:09.238 --> 02:08:12.861]  Lots of talk, because that's the problem with the black ops, to let him finish his work.
[02:08:13.221 --> 02:08:21.348]  The feds, it's now admitted, were coming down there and admitted everybody, told everybody to stand down for almost two hours before they got there.
[02:08:21.888 --> 02:08:24.550]  And then they still stood around for about an hour and a half.
[02:08:24.570 --> 02:08:26.552]  So we're talking about over three hours here.
[02:08:28.012 --> 02:08:29.894]  So the people now know that they can't be protected.
[02:08:29.914 --> 02:08:36.721]  We've got to get those emails out, got to get the stories that have been written by gun owners and all the other groups out to everybody.
[02:08:37.442 --> 02:08:46.791]  But most importantly, it is the big military psychiatric complex that has set up a plan to have psychiatrists and psychologists at all schools
[02:08:47.628 --> 02:09:07.239]  By federal law, forcing children, all children, four years of age to 18, Illinois, now pregnant women, even if you're homeschooled, are going to send CPS to your house, looking the whole time how to grab your kids, to do a psychological study, and of course they'd recommend Prozac or they'd take your kids if you don't put them on that or something else.
[02:09:07.519 --> 02:09:13.122]  Their internal documents on New Freedom Initiative say they want to put 50% in the next phase.
[02:09:13.382 --> 02:09:16.384]  They've already got close to 15, it's like 14 or 15 depending on which
[02:09:16.804 --> 02:09:17.124]  I think?
[02:09:25.518 --> 02:09:29.261]  But their answer to all this is going to be put more kids on.
[02:09:29.641 --> 02:09:39.248]  Then when you've got 50% on, you'll have four or five times the number of shootings and mass brainwashing that this allows through the television, the video games, and the culture.
[02:09:39.648 --> 02:09:42.510]  And then they'll put 100% on the drugs.
[02:09:42.930 --> 02:09:45.652]  See, it's all problem, reaction, solution.
[02:09:45.692 --> 02:09:47.854]  The more you talk about it, the more drugs come in.
[02:09:48.334 --> 02:09:49.956]  Sounds like a brave new world to me, Alex.
[02:09:49.996 --> 02:09:53.759]  I mean, this is exactly what Huxley was talking about decades and decades ago.
[02:09:53.820 --> 02:09:54.460]  He should have known.
[02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:55.922]  His brother, head of UNESCO.
[02:09:56.502 --> 02:09:59.145]  The head of the UN program and the head of eugenics program.
[02:09:59.805 --> 02:10:02.087]  So understand, folks, problem, reaction, solution.
[02:10:02.248 --> 02:10:02.788]  Ask yourself.
[02:10:02.948 --> 02:10:04.109]  Write articles yourselves.
[02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.870]  Email it out.
[02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:06.572]  We're going to write one.
[02:10:06.592 --> 02:10:09.575]  I know we've got psychologists listening, experts.
[02:10:09.595 --> 02:10:12.798]  We've got people who are more well-spoken than I, that know the truth of what I'm saying.
[02:10:13.258 --> 02:10:17.819]  Write articles, send them to www.AaronAndInfoWars.com, send them to www.WatsonAtPrisonPlanet.com.
[02:10:17.839 --> 02:10:19.239]  We're posting what you're writing.
[02:10:19.599 --> 02:10:31.762]  It's getting out there to people and understand that they're trying to put out a false story and say more drugs, more metal detectors, more pot-bellied police in Darth Vader outfits to keep you safe.
[02:10:32.242 --> 02:10:38.383]  Meanwhile, the borders are wide open, record numbers of illegals and legals are pouring in, and the reason I bring that up is
[02:10:38.903 --> 02:10:40.164]  They're not going to protect you.
[02:10:40.204 --> 02:10:42.806]  They're searching one out of a thousand containers.
[02:10:43.206 --> 02:10:44.827]  Plus, it's a joke.
[02:10:44.967 --> 02:10:46.529]  It's about controlling you.
[02:10:46.969 --> 02:10:48.470]  None of this is about security.
[02:10:48.710 --> 02:10:50.291]  The government cannot protect you.
[02:10:50.311 --> 02:10:51.512]  They will not protect you.
[02:10:52.313 --> 02:10:53.013]  Take Katrina.
[02:10:53.053 --> 02:10:54.574]  They screwed up there by design.
[02:10:54.594 --> 02:10:57.757]  They're going to get double the funding now and more powers and more control.
[02:10:57.817 --> 02:10:58.057]  See?
[02:10:58.717 --> 02:10:59.798]  They screwed up here.
[02:10:59.938 --> 02:11:01.499]  Oh, the answer is we need more of this.
[02:11:01.539 --> 02:11:03.701]  So, he is buying control.
[02:11:04.121 --> 02:11:06.603]  We have got to get this out and counter their propaganda.
[02:11:07.402 --> 02:11:11.884]  It is at the top of PrisonPlanet.com, and I'm begging you listeners, this is so important.
[02:11:12.284 --> 02:11:15.605]  Go get the story that the shooter was a mind control assassin.
[02:11:15.825 --> 02:11:18.847]  They're trying to bury it on Digg, drive it up to the top.
[02:11:19.407 --> 02:11:24.429]  I just saw some weird Digg reset that brought us from 130-something down to zero, and now it's building back up.
[02:11:24.849 --> 02:11:26.189]  They're banning the photos.
[02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:27.710]  They're banning the links to NASA.
[02:11:28.317 --> 02:11:31.359]  And Jack, please, I know I'm running off the mouth.
[02:11:32.019 --> 02:11:34.340]  Please recap for the Lizards before I go.
[02:11:35.101 --> 02:11:36.741]  Just so I can soak this in.
[02:11:37.182 --> 02:11:39.123]  Recap the State Department connections.
[02:11:39.223 --> 02:11:40.744]  Recap who's funding this school.
[02:11:41.024 --> 02:11:43.405]  Recap what you said when I first came on 30 minutes ago.
[02:11:43.905 --> 02:11:48.808]  Well, yeah, as we mentioned, both Joe's brother and sister were involved in the State Department.
[02:11:48.848 --> 02:11:49.968]  Both went to Princeton.
[02:11:51.627 --> 02:11:58.030]  The father received most of his gains, probably ill-gotten gains, I hate to just assume that, from Saudi Arabia.
[02:11:58.070 --> 02:12:01.872]  This is direct testimony from the grandfather, who was interviewed today.
[02:12:02.332 --> 02:12:12.117]  And then we have, of course, Northrop Grumman, involved in the very high school that Show went to, which coincidentally enough, just a few months ago, had another mass shooting, a student created a mass shooting.
[02:12:12.418 --> 02:12:12.678]  Unbelievable.
[02:12:12.698 --> 02:12:18.961]  And then you've got Columbine, and of course, Lockheed Martin's ownership of that town, where Columbine High School sat.
[02:12:20.306 --> 02:12:23.328]  And... Bowling for Blacksburg, I call it, Alex.
[02:12:23.368 --> 02:12:26.571]  Maybe we should start a ban for box cutters and jet airliners.
[02:12:27.912 --> 02:12:38.499]  Well, I mean, they just... I was talking to a security guard on the beach and he said that over spring break, you know, they had six stabbings in one weekend.
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:39.760]  Are we going to ban knives?
[02:12:39.820 --> 02:12:41.201]  Well, England's talking about this.
[02:12:41.262 --> 02:12:44.464]  Bottom line, folks, we've started kicking the New World Order's hind end.
[02:12:45.660 --> 02:12:48.221]  They're moving on us in a big way right now.
[02:12:48.641 --> 02:12:53.723]  You've got the tools on the internet, on the message boards, with your congressmen and women.
[02:12:53.763 --> 02:12:54.763]  You need to fight now.
[02:12:54.803 --> 02:12:56.344]  They have staged a new 9-11.
[02:12:56.684 --> 02:12:57.824]  There is no debating.
[02:12:57.864 --> 02:13:01.405]  When you look at all the evidence, this is a pure black op.
[02:13:01.826 --> 02:13:05.727]  And NBC knows by showing this tape and putting it out on every network,
[02:13:06.227 --> 02:13:16.210]  It's going to cause organic copycats who are in a dream state, who already play six plus hours a day, where they do thousands of simulated murders of human beings a day.
[02:13:16.530 --> 02:13:20.631]  You're going to see more mass shootings, and it's going to be NBC and Fox's fault.
[02:13:20.831 --> 02:13:25.152]  But see, they know nobody's going to think about that, so get articles out about copycatting.
[02:13:25.392 --> 02:13:26.573]  Get them all over the web.
[02:13:26.873 --> 02:13:32.654]  Explain that when there's another shooting, it's going to be greatly to the media's fault for doing this.
[02:13:32.734 --> 02:13:34.455]  We've got to do this right now.
[02:13:35.407 --> 02:13:38.737]  We've got to tell young people because they're trying to make this a trend and a fad.
[02:13:38.777 --> 02:13:39.921]  They're trying to make it cool.
[02:13:39.941 --> 02:13:41.084]  See, that's the second phase.
[02:13:41.165 --> 02:13:42.168]  It's just like in Iraq.
[02:13:42.609 --> 02:13:43.111]  Our government...
[02:13:43.829 --> 02:13:50.133]  The Israelis and the British staged terror attacks against Shia, against Sunni, Sunni against Shia, against Kurd.
[02:13:50.573 --> 02:14:00.020]  Then, once they start blowing up mosques, it just chain re- I think I heard a general on going, Al-Qaeda did bomb in the Green Zone to get the fighting going on.
[02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:03.362]  That's what Al-Qaeda does, and that's absolutely true.
[02:14:03.382 --> 02:14:06.244]  And we hope he knocked through those cartoons as well, Alex.
[02:14:06.344 --> 02:14:07.464]  Al-Qaeda's our government.
[02:14:07.665 --> 02:14:09.286]  Of course Al-Qaeda wants to get them fighting.
[02:14:09.326 --> 02:14:09.746]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:14:10.276 --> 02:14:14.021]  No, we can hook The Project for the New American Century to those inflammatory cartoons.
[02:14:14.181 --> 02:14:15.863]  There was plenty of copy about that.
[02:14:16.124 --> 02:14:18.967]  We also know, you know, with P-2-O-G and those moss bombings.
[02:14:19.007 --> 02:14:26.497]  And this is one of the elements of stories that gets lost with a big story like this and this massive distraction, because it is in many ways a distraction.
[02:14:26.517 --> 02:14:28.219]  Yeah, this mass shooting is only the primer.
[02:14:28.359 --> 02:14:45.010]  There were mass bombings in Iraq yesterday and today, and of course this kind of shooting, this kind of deranged behavior goes on every day in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we can of course equivocate that to more incidents here in this country, again reminding people today is the anniversary for both Oklahoma City and Waco.
[02:14:45.290 --> 02:14:52.195]  Notice how everything escalated this week, because on the satanic calendar, and this is a fact folks, the police will tell you
[02:14:52.675 --> 02:14:56.300]  More children get kidnapped, more people are murdered, more dead animals are found.
[02:14:56.380 --> 02:15:00.226]  It's all kept real quiet because there's Satanists running most major police departments.
[02:15:00.606 --> 02:15:01.788]  I'm sorry you can't handle this.
[02:15:02.168 --> 02:15:03.070]  They find these...
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:15.885]  The second biggest date is Shaolin right around Halloween, but the biggest date is the 15th through the 20th, and most of the kids are going to be killed tonight at midnight.
[02:15:15.905 --> 02:15:17.506]  They've kidnapped kids all over the country.
[02:15:17.726 --> 02:15:18.626]  They're going to be gutting them.
[02:15:18.646 --> 02:15:20.987]  They're going to be eating their hearts tonight at midnight.
[02:15:21.287 --> 02:15:24.729]  Ladies and gentlemen, tonight is the high holy time.
[02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:28.412]  This evening at midnight, there'll be children dying across America.
[02:15:28.613 --> 02:15:32.997]  And anyone who's skeptical about what you're saying, I just implore them to see your great film, Order of Death.
[02:15:33.057 --> 02:15:37.682]  You really put all that together in that film and show, you know, the type of people we're dealing with here.
[02:15:37.722 --> 02:15:38.943]  This isn't just for money.
[02:15:38.983 --> 02:15:42.947]  This isn't just for profit or even just for control or consolidation.
[02:15:43.187 --> 02:15:45.089]  They actually love doing this thing.
[02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:48.733]  That's why I look at this and I say, well, this is a mass sacrifice.
[02:15:49.193 --> 02:15:59.361]  It is, Jack, and we need the good people need to stand up and go out on the bridge and block the New World Order bowel rug that is trying to come across the bridge, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:59.682 --> 02:16:01.943]  We have to defeat the New World Order with God's help.
[02:16:02.244 --> 02:16:05.306]  We have to take action and call them what they are and be bold.
[02:16:05.626 --> 02:16:12.692]  And just like 80 plus percent of Americans don't believe the official story on 9-11, most Americans, and I remember interviewing Aaron Zellman and people,
[02:16:13.112 --> 02:16:18.315]  You know, at the last shootings, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago, they didn't say inside job.
[02:16:18.635 --> 02:16:19.355]  Now they do.
[02:16:19.656 --> 02:16:21.737]  It's mainstream, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:21.897 --> 02:16:22.917]  Look, Jack, I'm out of here.
[02:16:23.118 --> 02:16:24.718]  I'll pop in for only 30 minutes tomorrow.
[02:16:24.738 --> 02:16:26.699]  I want to thank you for sitting in and doing a great job.
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:29.781]  Please, listeners, go get the story on Prison Planet.
[02:16:30.201 --> 02:16:31.222]  Get it to the four winds.
[02:16:31.282 --> 02:16:32.883]  He is a mind control assassin.
[02:16:33.083 --> 02:16:35.204]  We're going to add all the data that Jack just brought up.
[02:16:35.584 --> 02:16:37.165]  Stay with us and get it out to everybody.
[02:16:37.665 --> 02:16:42.328]  Thank you for the input, Alex, and thank you for letting me sit behind the microphone today.
[02:16:43.568 --> 02:16:51.032]  I'm not even going to make a comment, well I guess I am, that KSM isn't behind this and that I'm sure is a shock to some of you.
[02:16:51.732 --> 02:16:54.154]  John, we have about a minute left in this segment, is that right?
[02:16:55.755 --> 02:16:57.275]  Okay, I want to go ahead and do this now.
[02:16:57.315 --> 02:17:04.919]  I want to have a moment of silence for all of the dead this week at Columbine, at Virginia Tech, Waco in particular, and Oklahoma City.
[02:17:04.939 --> 02:17:07.621]  If we can just all meditate, pray, what we do, sense some good
[02:17:08.463 --> 02:17:11.324]  Stuff out there to the families who have been involved in this.
[02:17:11.384 --> 02:17:12.404]  Let's go ahead and do that now.
[02:17:12.424 --> 02:17:14.225]  Just a moment of silence for the dead this week.
[02:17:44.180 --> 02:17:48.801]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[02:17:49.001 --> 02:17:53.442]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[02:17:53.622 --> 02:18:07.625]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey Light Water Purifier, an LED Base, two Berkey Sport Filtration Bottles, the Berkey Battery Adapter, the Berkey MP Solar Charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:18:07.865 --> 02:18:27.072]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.
[02:18:27.272 --> 02:18:30.894]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[02:18:31.054 --> 02:18:32.294]  The Berkey Security Pack.
[02:18:32.454 --> 02:18:33.715]  A retail value of $518 for only $399.
[02:18:36.556 --> 02:18:38.020]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:38.060 --> 02:18:39.323]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:44.531 --> 02:18:46.492]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[02:18:46.752 --> 02:18:49.374]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[02:18:49.694 --> 02:18:57.999]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[02:18:58.299 --> 02:19:01.141]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[02:19:01.961 --> 02:19:05.183]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[02:19:06.504 --> 02:19:08.085]  How much are you willing to lose?
[02:19:08.485 --> 02:19:09.406]  Take action now!
[02:19:09.526 --> 02:19:13.428]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[02:19:14.348 --> 02:19:18.110]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[02:19:18.330 --> 02:19:21.552]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[02:19:21.652 --> 02:19:23.273]  Current Federal Reserve policy and
[02:19:23.373 --> 02:19:28.515]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:19:28.535 --> 02:19:29.615]  Globalists are concerned
[02:20:00.237 --> 02:20:00.757]  We're good to go.
[02:20:21.323 --> 02:20:21.503]  Thank you.
[02:20:43.897 --> 02:20:50.378]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:20:50.619 --> 02:20:54.639]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:20:54.899 --> 02:20:57.040]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:20:57.400 --> 02:21:04.442]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[02:21:04.762 --> 02:21:07.362]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[02:21:07.622 --> 02:21:11.103]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[02:21:11.403 --> 02:21:19.307]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:21:19.667 --> 02:21:21.168]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:21:21.448 --> 02:21:33.355]  You'll find Nonex Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, Wayne Reed, and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[02:21:33.835 --> 02:21:36.118]  Or online at www.drugstore.com.
[02:21:36.538 --> 02:21:41.924]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:22:00.942 --> 02:22:03.283]  Thank you all for observing that moment of silence.
[02:22:04.583 --> 02:22:05.123]  What a week.
[02:22:07.004 --> 02:22:15.525]  Normally what we do on our program, I do it every year, this date, April 19th, is we go into Waco and Oklahoma City information.
[02:22:15.545 --> 02:22:23.627]  I'll be doing some of that on my program today, which again follows the Alex Jones Show on this Network Stream 1, Monday through Friday.
[02:22:23.767 --> 02:22:25.007]  So we'll do that.
[02:22:25.027 --> 02:22:26.728]  We also have a clip from Obama
[02:22:29.397 --> 02:22:32.784]  Where he's on David Letterman talking about the world order that he wants.
[02:22:33.225 --> 02:22:37.674]  I have a Bill Hicks clip talking about Waco and we have some information about the Chinese now.
[02:22:37.754 --> 02:22:40.359]  It's documented they're making artificial snow.
[02:22:41.041 --> 02:22:41.841]  Hi Jack, it's great to talk to you.
[02:23:12.269 --> 02:23:17.932]  I want to go ahead and start off by making some comments on the Virginia Tech incident.
[02:23:18.132 --> 02:23:21.394]  Okay.
[02:23:21.835 --> 02:23:33.782]  I'm running into people that are, you know, thinking that, you know, we're trying to make this an issue and say the government, you know, it's an inside job and that everything's an inside job, you know, because 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:23:34.483 --> 02:23:40.927]  And for those people, I just want people that are on that level, that are thinking like that, to just realize that
[02:23:41.841 --> 02:23:42.512]  Who benefits?
[02:23:43.208 --> 02:23:46.469]  When something like this happens, when there's a crime... Yeah, Cui Bono, for sure.
[02:23:46.489 --> 02:23:46.649]  Right.
[02:23:47.109 --> 02:23:50.109]  Well, yeah, but that's our job, you know, it doesn't hurt anything.
[02:23:50.129 --> 02:23:57.031]  I don't think we hurt anyone by exploring the possibilities here and laying out the coincidences.
[02:23:57.071 --> 02:24:01.052]  This is a film I'm working on, you know, is it coincidence or design?
[02:24:01.072 --> 02:24:06.613]  When we have so many of these coincidences, so much incompetence and malfeasance, I mean, what are we supposed to think?
[02:24:06.913 --> 02:24:11.594]  So somebody's got to say this stuff, and obviously it isn't going to be Fox News or MSNBC.
[02:24:12.566 --> 02:24:19.808]  Right, when you talk about who benefits, you know, whenever there's a crime, when somebody robs a bank, the bank robber benefits by getting money.
[02:24:20.248 --> 02:24:27.029]  When somebody, when there's a rape, the crazy individual doing that benefits by the pleasure of doing that particular act.
[02:24:27.589 --> 02:24:34.311]  Alright, when this guy involved in the Virginia Tech shooting did this, you gotta think about this logically.
[02:24:34.764 --> 02:24:40.605]  If someone like this was able to plan all this out, we know, I mean I knew this was an inside job when I first heard about it.
[02:24:40.785 --> 02:24:41.966]  I was upset immediately.
[02:24:42.026 --> 02:24:44.986]  I knew it's another, you know, just like Columbine.
[02:24:45.146 --> 02:24:48.167]  But, you know, and I knew that, I knew all the facts were going to trickle out.
[02:24:48.287 --> 02:24:51.508]  And they're trying to cover up Columbine and burying the documents.
[02:24:51.588 --> 02:24:57.089]  The parents aren't allowed to read the depositions which they tried to buy for thousands of dollars.
[02:24:57.129 --> 02:24:58.529]  These have been sealed and buried.
[02:24:58.809 --> 02:25:02.770]  So if they've got nothing to hide, why do they perpetually cover these things up?
[02:25:03.456 --> 02:25:09.143]  Exactly, and this guy, committing suicide in the end, he didn't benefit by doing that.
[02:25:10.224 --> 02:25:21.438]  The only one who could have benefited from this is the government, because they further instill the need to eventually take away our guns, and they want to disarm us all, because that's what they need to do before they can, you know,
[02:25:22.237 --> 02:25:26.361]  Danny, just to respond to the first part of your question, because we're all getting this now.
[02:25:26.421 --> 02:25:28.563]  Yes, we just think everything is a conspiracy.
[02:25:28.623 --> 02:25:29.304]  No, we don't.
[02:25:29.624 --> 02:25:41.935]  There have been multiple school shootings over the last year and we haven't given any of them this particular treatment because they didn't have such obvious, glaring inconsistencies that, again, it's our job to point out.
[02:25:41.995 --> 02:25:45.178]  But, look, I want to implore you people out there.
[02:25:45.578 --> 02:25:47.300]  Tell people how this went down.
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:49.303]  Don't tell them you know it's an inside job.
[02:25:49.703 --> 02:25:50.905]  Ask them questions.
[02:25:51.085 --> 02:25:54.589]  Use the Socratean method of asking them questions.
[02:25:55.050 --> 02:25:56.171]  The campus is so big.
[02:25:56.191 --> 02:25:58.354]  This is what the mainstream media tells us, okay?
[02:25:58.574 --> 02:26:02.198]  Danny, that the campus is so big they could never have known where he would be.
[02:26:02.719 --> 02:26:07.760]  He just happened to have done the shooting where the bomb threats were made a week earlier that they called a hoax.
[02:26:07.820 --> 02:26:10.720]  Apparently, this same individual had made the bomb threats.
[02:26:10.780 --> 02:26:18.262]  If they would have gone right where the bomb threats were and secured that building first with prior knowledge, knowing that that was a target, then they could have prevented this.
[02:26:18.282 --> 02:26:20.582]  Exactly.
[02:26:21.042 --> 02:26:23.483]  So you ask people, well why is that?
[02:26:24.583 --> 02:26:25.483]  How can that be?
[02:26:25.583 --> 02:26:32.064]  And let them answer the question and I think they'll be pointing the finger at them, calling them conspiracy theorists when the job is done.
[02:26:33.112 --> 02:26:33.553]  Exactly.
[02:26:33.853 --> 02:26:35.494]  That's the way it works.
[02:26:35.715 --> 02:26:38.297]  You have to be gentle approaching some people.
[02:26:38.738 --> 02:26:43.002]  And number one, remember this, is that none of us are disrespecting those victims.
[02:26:43.362 --> 02:26:44.444]  We are broken hearted.
[02:26:44.824 --> 02:26:46.886]  I mean, it hurts every time people are murdered.
[02:26:46.906 --> 02:26:47.847]  3,000 people were murdered on 9-11.
[02:26:47.867 --> 02:26:48.768]  655,000 plus Iraqi people have been murdered.
[02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:55.121]  Over 3,000 troops and now 33 more lives?
[02:26:55.141 --> 02:26:55.401]  Exactly.
[02:26:55.421 --> 02:26:57.483]  That right there, that's the bottom line.
[02:26:57.503 --> 02:26:59.144]  We need to avenge these people's deaths.
[02:27:10.478 --> 02:27:12.019]  We have to stop this from happening.
[02:27:12.039 --> 02:27:21.263]  We got, you know, these criminals, the New World Order that's behind this, we're not scared of you, and we're all... and there's people that are awake, and you guys out there, you New World Order criminals need to know that.
[02:27:21.443 --> 02:27:22.344]  Thanks for the call, Danny.
[02:27:22.364 --> 02:27:22.804]  We'll come back.
[02:27:22.844 --> 02:27:24.685]  We'll go to Scott, Lynn, David, and Paul.
[02:27:24.825 --> 02:27:25.145]  Hang on.
[02:27:25.185 --> 02:27:26.406]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:26.446 --> 02:27:27.606]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:27:34.429 --> 02:27:35.390]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:37.331]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.332 --> 02:27:41.026]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.224 --> 02:27:48.727]  Summer is once again just around the corner, and as usual, so are higher gas prices.
[02:27:49.167 --> 02:27:52.349]  This year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back.
[02:27:52.809 --> 02:28:00.875]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[02:28:01.815 --> 02:28:08.399]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised, Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem, unburned fuel.
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:12.542]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[02:28:13.022 --> 02:28:17.846]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[02:28:18.266 --> 02:28:24.871]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[02:28:25.491 --> 02:28:27.092]  And it's so easy to use.
[02:28:27.553 --> 02:28:33.477]  Simply pour a couple of ounces into your tank at every fill-up and you're on your way to saving money and the environment.
[02:28:33.917 --> 02:28:40.301]  So, do yourself and the environment a favor and visit ctsavegas.com to get your bottle today.
[02:28:40.581 --> 02:28:43.123]  That's ctsavegas.com.
[02:28:43.968 --> 02:28:51.075]  Craig Walcott, chartered financial consultant and host of the Dead Doctors Don't Lie radio program and million-dollar earner in the network marketing field since 1989.
[02:28:51.436 --> 02:28:53.218]  I certainly know what it takes to succeed.
[02:28:53.478 --> 02:28:58.903]  I also know without proper tools, your chance for significant income in the network marketing field can quickly fade.
[02:28:59.124 --> 02:29:05.050]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing will never spend the time nor money to develop the skills they need.
[02:29:05.290 --> 02:29:07.731]  That's where MLM Incorporated steps in.
[02:29:07.911 --> 02:29:14.733]  No matter what network marketing venture you're involved in, MLM Incorporated can provide you the successful tools you need to truly succeed.
[02:29:15.013 --> 02:29:24.616]  A subscription to MLM Incorporated will provide you access to the three-hour industrial revolution of network marketing seminar where you will learn to perform at a level you never thought possible.
[02:29:24.796 --> 02:29:28.157]  Radio, TV, Internet, direct mail will all be at your fingertips.
[02:29:28.217 --> 02:29:28.598]  I think so.
[02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:47.783]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:48.003 --> 02:29:51.405]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:51.565 --> 02:29:55.067]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:55.307 --> 02:29:58.529]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:29:58.549 --> 02:30:04.073]  This basic tenet of yeast and the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[02:30:04.093 --> 02:30:09.316]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill,
[02:30:09.636 --> 02:30:10.056]  Thank you!
[02:30:27.176 --> 02:30:31.061]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[02:30:50.926 --> 02:31:04.251]  Look at your young men fighting Look at your women crying Look at your young men dying The way they've always done before
[02:31:15.094 --> 02:31:16.174]  Welcome back to the show.
[02:31:16.214 --> 02:31:18.335]  We're going to go right back to your calls again.
[02:31:18.615 --> 02:31:22.857]  Alex is out today and tomorrow and I think Monday I am sitting in for Alex today.
[02:31:22.897 --> 02:31:25.318]  My name is Jack Blood of Deadline Live.
[02:31:25.518 --> 02:31:26.678]  We're on this very network.
[02:31:27.479 --> 02:31:35.061]  My website for daily news is uncoverthenews.com and my personal website, you can find out where I'm appearing and what we're up to, that's jackblood.com.
[02:31:35.302 --> 02:31:37.542]  Let me just quickly, before we go back to calls, throw this out.
[02:31:38.543 --> 02:31:39.043]  Today
[02:31:40.049 --> 02:31:45.216]  Up in Waco, well they'll be up in Oklahoma City at the Murrow building, there'll be a
[02:31:47.205 --> 02:31:48.925]  I don't know what to call it, a truth action.
[02:31:49.125 --> 02:31:55.227]  There will also be people up there memorializing the victims of Oklahoma City, so you can head up there.
[02:31:55.767 --> 02:31:58.687]  And also in Waco, there's going to be, I believe at about 6 p.m.
[02:31:58.747 --> 02:32:04.088]  tonight, there is going to be a memorial for the people that died in Waco, run by some of the survivors.
[02:32:04.108 --> 02:32:11.850]  For both of these events, John Lennon's piano that he wrote Imagine on is going to be shipped in, carted down, and Imagine will be played.
[02:32:12.450 --> 02:32:13.450]  at both of these events.
[02:32:13.490 --> 02:32:23.153]  So just to let you know, there are things going on up there that you can attend and this is really a good place for you to be today on this just fateful, fateful day, April 19, 2007.
[02:32:24.034 --> 02:32:26.214]  We'll go back to the phones 1-800-259-9231.
[02:32:26.234 --> 02:32:29.655]  Scott in Ohio.
[02:32:29.695 --> 02:32:30.375]  Thank you for holding.
[02:32:30.415 --> 02:32:31.516]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:31.956 --> 02:32:32.416]  Hi, Jack.
[02:32:32.696 --> 02:32:34.457]  Scott calling from the north coast of Ohio.
[02:32:34.477 --> 02:32:38.318]  I'm a first-time caller, big fan of both your show and Alex's show.
[02:32:38.338 --> 02:32:38.998]  Welcome aboard.
[02:32:39.458 --> 02:32:39.698]  Thanks.
[02:32:39.778 --> 02:32:42.361]  Great interview, by the way, this week with Greg Pallas.
[02:32:42.621 --> 02:32:42.981]  Thank you.
[02:32:43.001 --> 02:32:43.982]  I really enjoyed that one.
[02:32:44.282 --> 02:32:47.225]  I'd like to make a couple comments on the Virginia Tech shootings.
[02:32:47.465 --> 02:32:51.108]  I have a little bit of personal experience with Blacksburg.
[02:32:51.529 --> 02:32:57.474]  Growing up here in the north coast of Ohio, I have a good best friend from way back when I was seven years old.
[02:32:58.120 --> 02:32:58.900]  We're good to go.
[02:33:13.781 --> 02:33:26.974]  And I don't want that point to be lost on the listeners because many coming from a big city like myself will think even a city like Austin might be a town compared to a big burned out industrial Rust Belt city.
[02:33:27.474 --> 02:33:30.177]  But the important point to make is Austin's a huge city.
[02:33:30.497 --> 02:33:32.018]  Blacksburg is a tiny town.
[02:33:32.759 --> 02:33:37.283]  Any ban on guns in the city of Blacksburg or in
[02:33:38.314 --> 02:33:45.804]  Rather, at Virginia Tech, it's tantamount to a ban on guns in the city of Blacksburg because of the way the university is integrated into the city.
[02:33:47.046 --> 02:33:52.994]  The second point I'd like to make, and this is something I don't... That is traditionally, though, a pretty conservative part of the country, isn't it?
[02:33:53.074 --> 02:33:54.937]  Isn't Virginia what you would call a red state?
[02:33:56.114 --> 02:33:56.775]  I believe it is.
[02:33:57.196 --> 02:34:08.288]  I don't imagine these citizens will be rolling over or handing in their guns anytime soon, especially in light of what happened, which I think in many ways will backfire with their agenda to take our guns.
[02:34:08.348 --> 02:34:08.628]  Go ahead.
[02:34:08.949 --> 02:34:14.755]  I certainly think that's the case, but I'd like to bring up a point that I think hasn't really been raised much yet.
[02:34:16.098 --> 02:34:19.139]  Part of the point I want to make is brought up by watching.
[02:34:19.199 --> 02:34:22.020]  I finally turned on the mainstream media last night.
[02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:27.001]  I just avoided it because I knew there would be so much bio coming out in the mainstream media.
[02:34:27.301 --> 02:34:35.404]  But I finally turned it on and within a couple minutes on both the O'Reilly Show and I believe it was either CNN or MSNBC, they both picked apart the point that
[02:34:36.351 --> 02:34:36.731]  I don't
[02:34:53.504 --> 02:35:07.936]  So what I think we're going to start to see is not so much a push for gun control per se, but what I'll call soft gun control, where they're going to, you know, begin to introduce legislation that requires anyone that wants to obtain a firearm to go through a psychological test.
[02:35:07.956 --> 02:35:15.001]  Okay, well that's exactly what Carolyn McCarthy, the queen of gun grabbings, Bill 297, goes over at length.
[02:35:15.021 --> 02:35:16.543]  This would include, by the way,
[02:35:17.123 --> 02:35:30.234]  Anybody who could be coming back from Iraq or Iran, unfortunately, Afghanistan to these foreign wars, coming back and not being able to pass a mental competency test because maybe they're having flashbacks or or what have you.
[02:35:30.935 --> 02:35:38.141]  So this is a major part of existing gun legislation and I should also say McCarthy has a number of other bills including 1312, HR 1312,
[02:35:41.103 --> 02:35:42.904]  She doesn't even know her own bill.
[02:35:43.144 --> 02:35:45.185]  This was on the Tucker Carlson Show last night.
[02:35:45.245 --> 02:35:49.447]  He asked her what a barrel shroud was and she had absolutely no idea.
[02:35:49.747 --> 02:35:50.768]  Even though it's in her bill.
[02:35:50.808 --> 02:35:55.690]  Now I would go ahead and hedge to bet that 99.9% of this audience knows what a barrel shroud is.
[02:35:56.391 --> 02:35:58.233]  But here it is in her own bill and she doesn't know.
[02:35:58.393 --> 02:36:00.115]  You hit the point exactly on the head.
[02:36:00.696 --> 02:36:04.481]  Registration, tougher stances on IDing.
[02:36:04.641 --> 02:36:06.864]  Here in Texas we have pretty much an open door.
[02:36:06.944 --> 02:36:07.745]  You can buy a gun.
[02:36:07.785 --> 02:36:10.168]  You can get a concealed carry permit.
[02:36:10.188 --> 02:36:13.312]  You can even shoot to defend yourself on the street.
[02:36:13.672 --> 02:36:14.854]  That law just gone through.
[02:36:15.474 --> 02:36:24.797]  The 297 takes guns out of the hands of anybody who could have any kind of mental deficiency or mental black mark on their permanent record.
[02:36:24.837 --> 02:36:30.419]  And this could include, by the way, just having an argument with your spouse and being arrested for
[02:36:31.580 --> 02:36:48.293]  domestic violence and this of course again could be on your permanent record you'll not be allowed to have a gun so you call that soft gun legislation it's going to end up being rather hard I gotta tell you I gotta keep moving here because we have a lot of callers but that was a great job for a first call Scott I hope you call back again.
[02:36:48.313 --> 02:36:49.414]  I certainly will thanks Jack.
[02:36:49.434 --> 02:36:51.956]  Thank you so much gotta go to Lynn in Toronto Lynn
[02:36:52.668 --> 02:36:53.409]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:36:53.429 --> 02:36:54.529]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:55.110 --> 02:36:55.450]  Thank you.
[02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:57.432]  And this is my first call to you too, you know.
[02:36:57.612 --> 02:37:00.073]  Welcome aboard.
[02:37:00.314 --> 02:37:05.457]  First thing I heard was this list of school shootings and the link to Prozac.
[02:37:05.537 --> 02:37:06.698]  That was the first point.
[02:37:06.778 --> 02:37:15.645]  And the second is, so I'm interested in any document on that and any document on depopulation and the link to government documents.
[02:37:16.702 --> 02:37:19.604]  Well, we have quite a bit of information on all of that.
[02:37:21.065 --> 02:37:24.648]  I would want to direct you to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:37:25.188 --> 02:37:29.551]  We have a myriad of documents such as these at JackBloodForum.com.
[02:37:29.772 --> 02:37:39.098]  And if you want information about mental health, if you want to get up to speed on the drugging of America, among other things, you can Google CCHR.
[02:37:39.899 --> 02:37:45.343]  They are the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, who are a mental health watchdog group.
[02:37:45.643 --> 02:37:52.784]  And all of the information I went over with you on earlier in the program today is all documented within the confines of their organization.
[02:37:52.804 --> 02:37:54.945]  That is, again, the Citizens Commission on Human Rights.
[02:37:55.585 --> 02:38:01.686]  They are between us and the psychiatric dictatorship, or scientific dictatorship, and it's an important component of this.
[02:38:01.726 --> 02:38:12.368]  In fact, we know, Alex mentioned it on his show, before we had it documented, before we knew that this particular gentleman had been using psychotropic drugs, I mean, this is exactly, we knew that this would happen.
[02:38:12.408 --> 02:38:13.928]  It's a foregone conclusion
[02:38:14.608 --> 02:38:19.314]  Lynn, when we see these types of incidents that we know that this person has been put in psychotropic drugs.
[02:38:19.834 --> 02:38:20.575]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:38:20.776 --> 02:38:24.380]  And what's interesting to me from the standpoint of being a forensic handwriting examiner
[02:38:24.741 --> 02:38:33.664]  I'm very interested in looking at that guy's writing because that's going to monitor because those drugs affect the neurotransmitters which affect the nervous system and the hand is not steady.
[02:38:33.684 --> 02:38:36.805]  So when you try to write in that kind of a state it looks like something from hell.
[02:38:36.825 --> 02:38:38.525]  I can tell you that's an excellent point.
[02:38:38.785 --> 02:38:47.948]  That also would have to, we'd have to bring that down to a steady trigger finger and a most accurate shooting probably ever seen anywhere on the face of the earth.
[02:38:48.708 --> 02:38:59.956]  Again, many people, many witnesses saying that this gentleman was trained, but as you mentioned, if he was taking these meds, he might have a shaky trigger finger as well as shaky handwriting, all of which we need to look at.
[02:38:59.996 --> 02:39:03.779]  But one of the odd things about this, Lynn, and talking to the audience today,
[02:39:04.947 --> 02:39:07.889]  Yes, witnesses saw him taking prescription drugs.
[02:39:07.949 --> 02:39:18.298]  Most people now believe that he was taking these prescription drugs, but I have, at least I believe this is the information coming in, there is no record of him getting prescriptions for drugs.
[02:39:18.338 --> 02:39:25.764]  So he either got them on the black market, or somebody, and most people now assuming that he disappeared for hours and hours and hours at a time,
[02:39:26.064 --> 02:39:31.496]  That he was going to get some kind of special psychiatric help and these were given to him without a record.
[02:39:31.516 --> 02:39:34.121]  I assume that they didn't want this to come back and...
[02:39:35.217 --> 02:39:38.620]  And be talked about at a later date after the event itself.
[02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:44.885]  So there still are more questions than answers, but I think we can pretty much read into this what we are concluding today.
[02:39:45.185 --> 02:39:46.446]  Lynn, I appreciate the call.
[02:39:46.466 --> 02:39:47.907]  You did a great job on the show today.
[02:39:47.947 --> 02:39:48.648]  Please call back.
[02:39:49.008 --> 02:39:50.690]  Got to go to David in Atlanta.
[02:39:50.730 --> 02:39:54.893]  Atlanta will be my new hometown here starting this summer, so I'm glad to get calls from Atlanta.
[02:39:55.193 --> 02:39:56.234]  David, thank you for calling in.
[02:39:56.254 --> 02:39:57.255]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:39:57.921 --> 02:39:58.461]  Hey, thanks.
[02:39:58.521 --> 02:40:01.542]  It looks like you got three first-time callers back-to-back.
[02:40:01.702 --> 02:40:04.443]  Alright, well we're bringing them out of the woodwork today then, David.
[02:40:04.463 --> 02:40:05.343]  Good to have you on the show.
[02:40:05.923 --> 02:40:06.843]  Yeah, thanks.
[02:40:06.903 --> 02:40:09.524]  First of all, I wanted to thank Alex, because I know he's listening.
[02:40:09.584 --> 02:40:14.986]  He woke me up about two years ago, right after the election, and I haven't looked back since.
[02:40:15.086 --> 02:40:23.788]  I've seen a lot of these things that go down and, you know, with Project for a New American Century and all that, you can tell most of the stuff is
[02:40:24.972 --> 02:40:28.674]  It's an inside job and it just, it breaks my heart to see all this.
[02:40:29.214 --> 02:40:36.898]  I'm only 25 and I'm not even getting a chance to be able to really live in the real America.
[02:40:36.918 --> 02:40:41.381]  I'm living in this fake America.
[02:40:41.401 --> 02:40:47.124]  It's certainly not the America that we love, that our ancestors fought and died for.
[02:40:47.764 --> 02:40:48.424]  That's for sure.
[02:40:49.005 --> 02:40:51.766]  There's something we can do about that though and that's what we're trying to do, David.
[02:40:51.786 --> 02:40:53.347]  I know you want to help any way you can.
[02:40:54.119 --> 02:40:59.301]  Yeah, and in fact, I've actually got a MySpace page where I stream my own radio station.
[02:40:59.341 --> 02:41:05.903]  I'll stream Alex Jones' show, your show, and Revere Radio Network.
[02:41:05.983 --> 02:41:06.823]  I'll stream all those.
[02:41:06.863 --> 02:41:10.004]  I've got all my friends listening to that, and I'm trying to get the word out on that.
[02:41:10.044 --> 02:41:13.865]  I'll put a comment up on Alex's page later on today.
[02:41:13.885 --> 02:41:15.746]  Alright, anything else you wanted to add on this?
[02:41:16.346 --> 02:41:17.646]  Well, actually, yeah.
[02:41:17.866 --> 02:41:22.568]  I actually wanted to call in, because I tried to call in last week,
[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:26.841]  I heard Glenn Beck make a threat to Keith Olbermann.
[02:41:27.362 --> 02:41:35.204]  It was basically about how Glenn Beck said that, you know, Keith, there's going to be another attack coming.
[02:41:35.364 --> 02:41:35.965]  It's coming.
[02:41:36.045 --> 02:41:36.945]  We know it's coming.
[02:41:37.005 --> 02:41:41.146]  And if you keep on saying the things that you're saying, you're going to be out of a job.
[02:41:41.667 --> 02:41:48.769]  That's basically how he was trying to say, you know, you better wise up and get on our side or else we're just going to ruin your career.
[02:41:49.809 --> 02:41:51.450]  And that was Glenn Beck to Keith Olbermann.
[02:41:52.125 --> 02:41:53.827]  Oh yeah, it was on his radio show.
[02:41:53.867 --> 02:41:56.169]  It was at about 10 o'clock in the morning.
[02:41:56.190 --> 02:42:00.714]  And, you know, they freaked me out because I heard about that.
[02:42:00.734 --> 02:42:06.781]  Well, Glenn Beck's career isn't long for this world unless he changes his attitude, so I guess we can shoot that back at him.
[02:42:06.801 --> 02:42:14.269]  But isn't it interesting how people like Glenn Beck, people like Bill O'Reilly can make these public bodily threats.
[02:42:14.864 --> 02:42:15.364]  Yeah, it is.
[02:42:15.384 --> 02:42:18.526]  It always seems to happen to Oberlin, too, ever since he started coming out with
[02:42:39.376 --> 02:42:41.097]  Well, we need to ride over men as well.
[02:42:41.137 --> 02:42:46.519]  We need to call in or ride over men and say that mass murderers love unarmed peasants.
[02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:55.663]  This is the key word we need to tell the people that think that the guns are just for hunting and that we don't need barrel shrouds or we don't need automatic weapons.
[02:42:55.924 --> 02:42:57.264]  We don't need those to kill deer.
[02:42:57.304 --> 02:43:06.108]  We need those to defend ourselves and that couldn't be clearer in the Hurricane Katrina disaster or in this recent case in Blacksburg, Virginia.
[02:43:06.448 --> 02:43:07.689]  Appreciate the call, David.
[02:43:07.709 --> 02:43:12.071]  I hope you join our Atlanta 9-11 Truth Group down there, and I'll be looking forward to meeting you very soon.
[02:43:12.392 --> 02:43:14.033]  Paul, calling from Nevada.
[02:43:14.093 --> 02:43:15.393]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:15.433 --> 02:43:16.094]  Thank you for calling.
[02:43:16.614 --> 02:43:18.235]  Jack, honored to speak with you.
[02:43:18.255 --> 02:43:19.216]  You're doing phenomenal.
[02:43:19.356 --> 02:43:19.696]  Thank you.
[02:43:19.916 --> 02:43:25.199]  I just wanted to add a couple quick comments on why I believe this occurred at the time that it did.
[02:43:27.401 --> 02:43:29.442]  Not only for all the reasons that you've mentioned,
[02:43:29.935 --> 02:43:30.535]  I don't think so.
[02:43:42.962 --> 02:43:50.928]  On the 9-11 trade, if Rosie had gotten Steven Jones onto her show, onto The View, to an audience of 20 or 30 people... Which they're still working on, by the way.
[02:43:50.988 --> 02:43:51.628]  Right, I understand.
[02:43:51.668 --> 02:43:56.291]  We need to pray, and I would advise everybody, please go to SupportRosie and get in the petition.
[02:43:56.351 --> 02:44:04.837]  But also, I've been twice a day, having family members or more, at least, and I'm doing it myself, twice a day, email ABC and tell them how much you support her.
[02:44:05.237 --> 02:44:09.821]  And her views, because when they get 10 to 1 email supporting her, you've got to do that.
[02:44:10.642 --> 02:44:13.964]  But my point is, all of that was getting ready to go supernova.
[02:44:14.225 --> 02:44:17.988]  There's evidence Imus and others were going to start pecking at this.
[02:44:18.708 --> 02:44:22.592]  Well, the Imus information about 9-11 was a hoax.
[02:44:23.032 --> 02:44:23.492]  Oh, was it?
[02:44:23.552 --> 02:44:24.573]  Okay, alright.
[02:44:24.673 --> 02:44:27.276]  I really never believed from the beginning that he was anyway.
[02:44:27.776 --> 02:44:32.400]  I think he was an example to all of everyone, whether it be Jack Bloods, Alex Jones,
[02:44:32.660 --> 02:44:43.549]  Whoever, because even Sean Hannity came out, and we know what a neocon shill he is, but even on Fox News, he came out and said, uh, this is very, very dangerous to free speech, what's happening to Don Imus.
[02:44:43.949 --> 02:44:45.010]  You know what's interesting, Paul?
[02:44:45.030 --> 02:44:46.251]  Can I interrupt you for a second?
[02:44:46.271 --> 02:44:46.592]  Absolutely.
[02:44:46.612 --> 02:44:50.515]  Because you just brought up a very interesting point, and I don't know why I didn't think of this before.
[02:44:50.955 --> 02:44:52.536]  They got rid of Imus last week.
[02:44:52.556 --> 02:44:53.978]  They had this shooting this week.
[02:44:53.998 --> 02:45:00.203]  You know, one of Imus' pet peeves, something that he did talk about regarding the truth, is the, uh,
[02:45:00.823 --> 02:45:04.807]  The prescription drug industry and how they're drugging our children.
[02:45:05.228 --> 02:45:13.697]  He's also talked quite a bit about vaccines and how we are on this constant treadmill to get well by making us sick.
[02:45:13.997 --> 02:45:17.781]  This makes us persistent and consistent and perpetual patients.
[02:45:18.321 --> 02:45:31.131]  for the medical industry and for the pharmaceutical cartels and that is something he was very outspoken about and I imagine if he was on the air this week, Paul, he would be taking this Blacksburg shooting and railing against the pharmaceutical cartels.
[02:45:31.511 --> 02:45:32.171]  Very good point.
[02:45:32.572 --> 02:45:33.732]  I was not aware of that.
[02:45:34.073 --> 02:45:39.236]  And the second thing, the reason I believe it happened on the very date that it did occur, I think they wanted it for the 19th.
[02:45:39.296 --> 02:45:44.700]  If you study the occult and you study the history of that date, as you guys have covered so well, I really believe they wanted it that.
[02:45:45.001 --> 02:45:46.902]  But Attorney General Gonzalez's hearings
[02:45:47.481 --> 02:46:01.990]  Uh, we're scheduled the day after the shooting and they had to get it before and jump start that and knock that story to the back page and his testimony now becomes just it will never be able to be the spark that it could have been that lit into a fire.
[02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:05.352]  I believe because if you study how far back he goes with Bush,
[02:46:05.871 --> 02:46:08.633]  And that he is in with the whole occult system and everything else.
[02:46:08.693 --> 02:46:09.814]  They had to protect their own.
[02:46:09.834 --> 02:46:15.118]  And I believe they had this plan for the 19th, moved it to the 16th to protect him.
[02:46:16.058 --> 02:46:18.960]  And there's a multiple number of reasons they're doing this.
[02:46:19.020 --> 02:46:24.064]  And the other one is the hate crime legislation, which is mixed with the House, Senate, Ted Pike, all over this.
[02:46:24.104 --> 02:46:25.385]  You guys ought to go to truetellers.org.
[02:46:26.109 --> 02:46:30.194]  You've got to write in or email or call your congressman and senator.
[02:46:30.214 --> 02:46:33.018]  Yeah, I had Ted on my show yesterday just talking about that very thing.
[02:46:33.058 --> 02:46:36.603]  We're in an emergency situation right now with the hate crimes legislation.
[02:46:36.663 --> 02:46:38.966]  I mean, look, Webster Tarpley was talking about this.
[02:46:38.986 --> 02:46:44.333]  We had a big conference here at the University of Texas over the weekend thanks to the good people at Project for a New American Citizen.
[02:46:44.993 --> 02:46:46.835]  Here in Austin, Texas, Alex spoke there as well.
[02:46:46.875 --> 02:47:07.995]  Webster Tarpley was making this point that when you see these mass distractions, Britney Spears, Anna Nicole Smith, Imus, and now this is a shooting, though this is news more than a distraction, you know that they're cooking something up, that they're trying to have you not look at using misdirection in order to do that, and this of course has to be a pending attack on Iran, you know,
[02:47:08.155 --> 02:47:10.297]  future expansion into the Middle East.
[02:47:10.577 --> 02:47:11.398]  There are so many things.
[02:47:11.458 --> 02:47:13.179]  Of course, the hate crimes bill, which you mentioned.
[02:47:13.419 --> 02:47:16.041]  We have a checkpoint bill here in Texas.
[02:47:16.522 --> 02:47:21.665]  So many little things are trying to slip in on us, including the new Freedom Initiative and No Child Left Behind.
[02:47:21.946 --> 02:47:27.090]  So we've got to stay focused on these things, even as we try to decode this news story.
[02:47:27.730 --> 02:47:28.791]  Good call, Paul.
[02:47:28.811 --> 02:47:30.152]  I really appreciate you calling in today.
[02:47:30.192 --> 02:47:31.613]  Let's go to Rich in New Jersey.
[02:47:31.713 --> 02:47:32.754]  Rich, thank you for joining us.
[02:47:32.794 --> 02:47:34.035]  You're on the Alex Jones Show today.
[02:47:34.575 --> 02:47:35.056]  Hey, Jack.
[02:47:35.116 --> 02:47:35.536]  How are you?
[02:47:35.596 --> 02:47:36.397]  Rich from New Jersey.
[02:47:37.199 --> 02:47:37.999]  I wanted to thank you.
[02:47:38.019 --> 02:47:42.041]  You played my song called Patriot Radio a bunch of times back in 2005.
[02:47:42.161 --> 02:47:43.001]  Oh, that's your song?
[02:47:43.021 --> 02:47:45.082]  I really appreciated hearing that.
[02:47:45.342 --> 02:47:46.322]  Yeah, that's a great song.
[02:47:46.362 --> 02:47:47.102]  Thank you for writing it.
[02:47:47.663 --> 02:47:48.223]  Yeah, man.
[02:47:48.403 --> 02:47:50.524]  And, well, it kind of gets me to my point today.
[02:47:50.864 --> 02:47:53.845]  There's a follow-up to that song, and it's called Patriot's Day.
[02:47:53.865 --> 02:47:56.506]  And I've been listening to Alex and yourself.
[02:47:56.606 --> 02:48:03.068]  And, you know, today, I think we need to keep in mind that, you know, today is a good day for the Patriots movement.
[02:48:04.185 --> 02:48:05.327]  It's April 19th.
[02:48:05.667 --> 02:48:07.289]  It is Patriots Day for a reason.
[02:48:07.369 --> 02:48:18.964]  It was the day that the Revolutionary War began, where the first people who were standing up against tyranny acted and were really successful.
[02:48:20.354 --> 02:48:20.955]  That's true.
[02:48:20.995 --> 02:48:24.716]  Actually, Rich, if I can just hold you over because we've mentioned this on the program.
[02:48:24.736 --> 02:48:27.898]  I know Mike Rivero mentioned this earlier, that it is Patriots today.
[02:48:27.938 --> 02:48:34.381]  Of course, that gets lost in all of these diabolical killings that we have to memorialize throughout the week as well.
[02:48:34.401 --> 02:48:36.182]  So, Rich, I'll hold you over for a minute on the other side.
[02:48:36.503 --> 02:48:37.523]  And then we have Ishmael.
[02:48:37.863 --> 02:48:38.724]  Is that Ishmael Axe?
[02:48:39.104 --> 02:48:41.805]  Calling in from Philadelphia on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:41.825 --> 02:48:42.946]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:47.268 --> 02:48:52.716]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:53.077 --> 02:49:00.708]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:01.423 --> 02:49:08.467]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:08.868 --> 02:49:20.335]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.615 --> 02:49:24.297]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:24.577 --> 02:49:26.498]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:26.838 --> 02:49:30.681]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:59.109 --> 02:51:04.030]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.

[02:52:13.047 --> 02:52:17.111]  I just don't want you to know I can see through your masks.
[02:52:17.491 --> 02:52:21.534]  Alright, we're going to do our best to take as many polls as we can here in a few minutes.
[02:52:21.594 --> 02:52:22.775]  Somewhat rapid fire.
[02:52:23.376 --> 02:52:31.763]  Also, anybody that wants to hold over from this show, my show begins just about six minutes after we go to the top of the hour propaganda news break, and then Deadline Live will begin.
[02:52:31.783 --> 02:52:36.267]  If you want to hold over, you're more than welcome to, or you can call into our show if you didn't have time.
[02:52:36.807 --> 02:52:38.229]  Couldn't get all your comments in.
[02:52:38.469 --> 02:52:47.922]  I should say, one of our producers just came on the air and said the first new gun legislation has been put forward after the Blacksburg incident is HR 1859 by who else?
[02:52:51.503 --> 02:52:54.784]  Anti-gun representative Carolyn McCarthy.
[02:52:55.065 --> 02:52:59.146]  She has now four pending bills, as far as I can see.
[02:52:59.166 --> 02:53:04.348]  297, 1312, I forgot the one, and now this new one that is 1859.
[02:53:04.648 --> 02:53:07.370]  This will ban high cap mags.
[02:53:07.390 --> 02:53:14.312]  That means that, you know, multiple loading magazines that would have more than, I would guess, a few shots.
[02:53:14.533 --> 02:53:18.014]  They're giving you six shooters now, I guess folks, so that is something else.
[02:53:18.254 --> 02:53:23.016]  Well, I just think between the 18th and the 19th, the Patriot movement itself has a couple days that they can use to really galvanize for the truth.
[02:53:23.036 --> 02:53:26.018]  The 18th was the day of Paul Revere's midnight ride, the 19th was followed on
[02:53:42.728 --> 02:53:53.219]  By the first shot to the Civil War, we have the gold standard going off in 1933, and we also have the uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto which fought against tyranny.
[02:53:53.259 --> 02:53:54.340]  So if we could focus on
[02:53:54.830 --> 02:54:02.172]  Those aspects of the day, instead of the way the day's been undermined and twisted, we still have something that could be used.
[02:54:02.272 --> 02:54:24.157]  I understand that, but you agree that somebody's got to get out there and decode all of this, and of course Genesis is the place that does that, so we have a responsibility to decode this new story, tell you about new gun legislation, and that's the thing that's terrible here, is that we could be memorializing and decoding what happened at Waco or Oklahoma City, showing those for what they really were, police actions and false flag terrorism,
[02:54:24.897 --> 02:54:35.425]  We could be talking about Patriots Day, and you're right, it is somewhat of a distraction, but people look to us, as you understand, Rich, to decode this, and we have an obligation to do it and follow breaking news stories on the program.
[02:54:35.465 --> 02:54:37.867]  But let's not let any of this get lost today.
[02:54:38.087 --> 02:54:39.328]  Thank you for bringing it up, Rich.
[02:54:39.368 --> 02:54:40.008]  I appreciate it.
[02:54:40.209 --> 02:54:42.390]  Let's go to Ishmael in Philadelphia.
[02:54:42.450 --> 02:54:45.913]  You have a very interesting name these days.
[02:54:45.933 --> 02:54:48.935]  I don't know if anybody's been saying anything to you about it, but you're on the air.
[02:54:49.215 --> 02:54:51.116]  Well, yeah, it's great to be on your show.
[02:54:52.270 --> 02:55:07.030]  My name is Ishmael and when I heard about the Ishmael Axe on the guy's arm it instantly intrigued me and I did some research and I would like to tell you that I really think I
[02:55:08.221 --> 02:55:13.526]  I believe I've proven... Well, we're almost out of time, so you're going to have to give us your best point here.
[02:55:13.807 --> 02:55:15.028]  It's an activation trigger.
[02:55:15.588 --> 02:55:18.271]  He was a mind-controlled slave, and I've written up an article.
[02:55:18.311 --> 02:55:30.423]  I'd like to send it to you guys, and it has to do with Springmeier's Illuminati formula to create an undetectable mind-controlled slave, and this was an activation trigger, and I can prove it, and it links with
[02:55:31.002 --> 02:55:39.530]  Well, please, if you could, you can even call back on my program here, which is coming up in just a couple of minutes on this network, and I'd love to hear what you have to say.
[02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:42.112]  Please send me a copy at jackblood at hotmail.com.
[02:55:42.393 --> 02:55:50.280]  Send to Aaron at Infowars.com, and send this as a news item to Infowars or to Paul as well, and let them put this in the mix.
[02:55:51.350 --> 02:55:52.851]  We've done some homework on this ourselves.
[02:55:52.891 --> 02:55:54.512]  I'm sorry to everybody holding.
[02:55:54.532 --> 02:55:56.132]  You are more than welcome to hold over.
[02:55:56.172 --> 02:55:58.713]  We'll try to put you right into Deadline Live coming up next.
[02:55:58.753 --> 02:56:01.194]  Folks, thank you for letting me sit in for Alex Jones today.
[02:56:01.215 --> 02:56:02.475]  I'll be back tomorrow as well.
