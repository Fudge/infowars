[00:00:05.751 --> 00:00:06.392]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.052 --> 00:00:08.112]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:09.952]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.572 --> 00:00:11.413]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.153 --> 00:00:13.053]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.693 --> 00:00:17.674]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:21.995]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:38.854]  Welcome my friends, welcome.
[00:00:39.654 --> 00:00:47.581]  It is the 26th day of March 2007 and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:58.571]  We don't have any guests today because I have a ton of vital news information to chronicle and dissect and cover and backtrack and basically go through.
[00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:09.520]  As we reverse engineer the criminal activities of the New World Order and basically lay out what their current operations and future operations are, so we can then move to stop them.
[00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:12.823]  Tons of news.
[00:01:12.863 --> 00:01:15.084]  We'll also have wide open phones at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:15.104 --> 00:01:16.345]  There's so many issues here.
[00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:21.649]  I mean, I could spend all day covering the fact that we've known for a long time they're using
[00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:39.731]  The bones and body parts in the aggregates taken out of the World Trade Center wound to fill potholes for asphalt and concrete production.
[00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:40.971]  We've known that.
[00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:48.034]  I saw websites probably a year ago with the families complaining about it, and we've written articles about it in the last six, seven months.
[00:01:48.054 --> 00:01:49.675]  We're going to do another piece on that.
[00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:52.488]  The Reuters and AP picked up on it.
[00:01:53.068 --> 00:02:02.931]  Just, you know, taking the body parts and using them for building roads in New York and New Jersey and Rhode Island and surrounding areas up and down the coast.
[00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:11.433]  They've been barging out the aggregates that are being recycled into the surrounding area.
[00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:19.322]  And you know, it sounds compared to looming World War III, with Iran that we'll be getting into, and with what's happening with the economy.
[00:02:19.362 --> 00:02:26.688]  It seems to pale in significance, but it just shows the attitude of these people, because that's what they see us as, as a whole, anyways.
[00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.392]  We're seen, literally, as just human resources.
[00:02:31.432 --> 00:02:32.673]  That's why they use that term.
[00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:34.515]  It's all hidden in plain view.
[00:02:35.732 --> 00:02:37.694]  Here's some of the news we'll be covering today.
[00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:44.039]  Senator Hagel, there are ways to deal with a president who says, I don't care about the Congress.
[00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.461]  Stocks fall on housing data.
[00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:51.905]  Oil prices hit 2007 highs on Iran tensions.
[00:02:51.925 --> 00:02:54.307]  They're busy going right back up because the election's over.
[00:02:56.388 --> 00:02:59.691]  IMF to urge further depreciation in the dollar.
[00:03:01.383 --> 00:03:07.145]  I guess that means my British employees will be homeless because they can barely make a living right now with what I pay them.
[00:03:08.025 --> 00:03:12.166]  Which would be a princely sum here in the U.S., but it'll be like Mexican pesos soon.
[00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:14.947]  Don't tell a slack-jawed yuppie that, though.
[00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:15.887]  They'll call you a traitor.
[00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:18.548]  Don't tell them the open borders are hurting us either.
[00:03:18.568 --> 00:03:19.428]  They'll call you a traitor.
[00:03:19.468 --> 00:03:20.088]  It's what they do.
[00:03:20.148 --> 00:03:20.909]  They're un-American.
[00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:23.289]  Drones could defend airports.
[00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.169]  That's chilling.
[00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.730]  I'll tell you what's really behind that.
[00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:28.236]  That's USA Today.
[00:03:28.736 --> 00:03:31.838]  Blair says Iran must free naval prisoners in days.
[00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:35.840]  Now you have your Tonkinian provocation there.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.663]  Look what Israel did over two captured Israeli soldiers that were admittedly sent over the border repeatedly to be captured.
[00:03:43.604 --> 00:03:47.486]  Seizure unjustified, Iran warned.
[00:03:47.506 --> 00:03:51.968]  And Iran admits to interrogating captured Marines as fears grow of show trial.
[00:03:52.907 --> 00:03:55.888]  Well, they could publicly torture them and it'd be admissible in court.
[00:03:55.908 --> 00:03:57.008]  It is now in this country.
[00:03:57.648 --> 00:04:03.430]  So, what's good for the goose is good for the gander, as they say.
[00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.632]  American raid and arrest set scene for capture of Marines.
[00:04:10.452 --> 00:04:13.713]  Iran denies UK access to the sailors.
[00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:16.329]  We'll go through all those developments.
[00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.412]  Roadside bombings killed five G.I.s over the weekend.
[00:04:21.032 --> 00:04:24.394]  Attack on Deputy Prime Minister in Iraq considered an inside job.
[00:04:24.414 --> 00:04:28.297]  That's not our headline, that's the A.P.'s.
[00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:29.818]  U.S.
[00:04:29.938 --> 00:04:34.240]  Iraqi court courts some insurgents.
[00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:41.165]  Trilateral globalists call for gas tax hike for North American Union.
[00:04:43.173 --> 00:04:46.978]  It's all coming up, including amazing cloning news.
[00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:49.080]  Very frightening cloning news.
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.842]  It's a giant news day.
[00:04:51.383 --> 00:04:52.484]  I'm going to blitz through it.
[00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:55.808]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:56.268]  Stay with me.
[00:04:56.288 --> 00:04:58.771]  PrisonPlanet.com is the website.
[00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:02.606]  Terrorism!
[00:05:02.787 --> 00:05:03.527]  Terrorism!
[00:05:03.647 --> 00:05:09.710]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.551]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:14.272]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:05:14.672 --> 00:05:29.240]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.580]  government.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.581]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:05:31.941 --> 00:05:37.843]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:05:37.983 --> 00:05:42.484]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.
[00:05:42.724 --> 00:05:48.346]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:05:48.366 --> 00:05:50.186]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:05:50.206 --> 00:05:50.586]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:05:50.627 --> 00:05:52.387]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:06:04.443 --> 00:06:09.886]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:17.890]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.587 --> 00:06:25.652]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:37.480]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.781 --> 00:06:41.263]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.723 --> 00:06:43.665]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:44.025 --> 00:06:47.868]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:02.363 --> 00:07:04.805]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:07:05.246 --> 00:07:12.091]  Did you know that one of the 45 objectives of international communism was to have America become involved in free trade?
[00:07:12.671 --> 00:07:22.579]  Without tariffs on cheaply produced foreign goods, our manufacturing base, which would not be able to compete, would be forced to move their manufacturing plants overseas or to Mexico.
[00:07:23.299 --> 00:07:29.464]  This would throw millions of workers out of work and completely destroy the middle class that has made America great.
[00:07:30.184 --> 00:07:37.850]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:40.372]  Just call our toll-free number at 1-800-516-8736.

[00:07:41.833 --> 00:07:42.614]  Call now.

[00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:03.750]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.331 --> 00:08:07.095]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:10.913]  This will be a day long remembered.
[00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:13.755]  We are going to take a lot of phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:13.795 --> 00:08:21.221]  But if we're going to go to a lot of your calls, you need to get to them quickly, and you need to have your point or question ready.
[00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:23.042]  And I need to not be long-winded.
[00:08:23.523 --> 00:08:24.323]  A real problem.
[00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:26.725]  And so we can move on to the next person.
[00:08:26.745 --> 00:08:31.209]  But I'm going to cover this first, before I get into Iran, the economy, all of it.
[00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.672]  And I'm going to do this in blitzkrieg fashion as best I can.
[00:08:35.365 --> 00:08:36.445]  This came out last week.
[00:08:36.565 --> 00:08:39.827]  I mentioned it, but I never detailed it because, to me, it was old news.
[00:08:40.507 --> 00:08:57.013]  Wired Magazine, I guess about four and a half, five years ago, had a story on the, at the time, I think 87-year-old head futurist at the Pentagon who'd been there since it was the Department of War, back when we didn't have as much doublespeak in this country.
[00:08:57.593 --> 00:08:59.914]  And they just called it what it was, the Department of War.
[00:09:00.658 --> 00:09:02.599]  Going around and kicking everybody's hind ends in.
[00:09:03.239 --> 00:09:07.200]  America has just been an empire for 50 years or so and there was no lie about it.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.361]  No ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[00:09:10.521 --> 00:09:17.503]  But he talked about how in the future it won't be the weapons we have but what drugs our soldiers are on.
[00:09:18.363 --> 00:09:28.386]  And if you think the speed, the pharmacological or pharma grade speed is bad, they said that they were testing in Afghanistan
[00:09:30.413 --> 00:09:55.474]  So I guess this was right during the war, this was about four and a half years ago, right while it was raging over in Afghanistan, were on aggression drugs and that they were testing aggression drugs and stamina type drugs, Hitler did this too, in fact they invented what you know as modern anabolic steroids, on the troops and then they were giving them pleasure drugs afterwards and amnesia drugs afterwards.
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.761]  The Globalist Plan, and I have mainstream history department documents from the government.
[00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:08.802]  I have mainstream government-sponsored studies from the 60s and 70s.
[00:10:08.862 --> 00:10:15.483]  It's going to be in the new film, when I had Dr. David Kaufman down here, Dr. Michael Kaufman down here, to cover all of this.
[00:10:16.343 --> 00:10:27.306]  And they talk about how they're going to use entertainment, they're going to use drugs, they're going to make them freely available, that is the prescription drugs, to basically sedate the population so they don't resist the tyranny.
[00:10:28.006 --> 00:10:29.026]  And that the high-tech
[00:10:29.776 --> 00:10:40.461]  Designer drugs are going to be so addictive that people aren't going to be able to control themselves, and if you ever take it, you're going to be addicted, and that's going to be the end of it, and the government's going to control the issuance of those.
[00:10:40.761 --> 00:10:50.305]  Then, conversely, they also control the narcotics that are coming into the country, like that big bust of tons and tons, the biggest maritime bust at sea of cocaine ever.
[00:10:51.145 --> 00:10:56.908]  I mean, that's not even a day's supply of what gets snorted and smoked and everything else in this country.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.921]  And, uh, guaranteed that's some drug cartel that didn't pay their cut.
[00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:05.043]  And everybody was saying, look how brazen they are, you know, just a big ship full of cocaine.
[00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:06.803]  That's how they operate!
[00:11:07.484 --> 00:11:15.787]  And if you're a cartel that's fallen out of favor, or a cartel that hasn't, you know, been paying all their laundering fees, that could be upwards of 30%, it's over!
[00:11:16.487 --> 00:11:19.648]  That's, and then, they have the nerve, well, I'm, I'm already digressing.
[00:11:21.068 --> 00:11:21.929]  I'm already digressing.
[00:11:22.669 --> 00:11:25.110]  So when I saw this last week, I didn't get into it.
[00:11:27.407 --> 00:11:36.010]  Erasing the pain of the past, scientists are developing drugs that could eliminate traumatic events from our memories.
[00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.310]  ABC News.
[00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:51.194]  I'd take it in a second, said Sergeant Michael Walcott, an Iraq war veteran, referring to an experimental drug with the potential to target and erase traumatic memories.
[00:11:52.135 --> 00:11:56.876]  Walcott, who served in the Ballad-Based Transportation Unit,
[00:11:57.725 --> 00:11:58.245]  That's right.
[00:12:18.692 --> 00:12:19.613]  That you've changed.
[00:12:20.133 --> 00:12:22.014]  There are many others like Wolcott.
[00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:25.956]  The Army estimates that one in eight soldiers... So, that was Vietnam.
[00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:30.199]  It's going to be four out of eight at least because you're keeping them in two, three, four tours.
[00:12:30.219 --> 00:12:33.301]  Okay, they never kept them in more than one year before.
[00:12:33.741 --> 00:12:38.524]  The Army estimates that one in eight soldiers returning home from Iraq suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:12:38.904 --> 00:12:47.129]  Symptoms of the disorder, once known as shell shock, include flashbacks, nightmares, feelings of detachment, irritability, trouble concentrating and sleeplessness.
[00:12:49.406 --> 00:12:56.789]  And it goes on, uh, much about why painful memories come back to haunt soldiers and those who live through traumatic experiences remains unknown.
[00:12:56.809 --> 00:13:00.610]  Scientists say it's because little is known about how the brain stores and recalls memories.
[00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:10.013]  And then it goes on to say that they've got a new wonderful drug, uh, that they're testing it on human subjects at Massachusetts General Hospital.
[00:13:10.828 --> 00:13:14.750]  And it alters memories in the immediate aftermath of specific trauma.
[00:13:15.371 --> 00:13:21.255]  Automobile accidents, and it goes on to say they arrive at the hospital and they're given the drugs immediately.
[00:13:21.275 --> 00:13:26.758]  And it just goes through the ethical firestorm, a genie in a bottle.
[00:13:27.058 --> 00:13:31.581]  But the idea of improving or weakening people's memories gives many medical ethicists pause.
[00:13:32.101 --> 00:13:32.842]  And it goes on.
[00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:36.404]  Let me just say this.
[00:13:38.278 --> 00:13:42.722]  If you kill somebody in self-defense of your family, I'm going to tell you right now you're going to feel good about it.
[00:13:44.244 --> 00:13:51.510]  If a bully is sitting there pounding on you and you go ahead and break their jaw, knock them to the ground, you're going to feel good about it.
[00:13:54.213 --> 00:14:03.301]  If you catch somebody breaking into your garage and they're running out with some of your stuff and you grab them by the hair and punch them
[00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.971]  And, you know, face a couple times and call the police, you're going to feel good about it.
[00:14:09.251 --> 00:14:21.193]  But, if you shoot a bunch of women and children, and there's little dead children with their guts all over the ground, sitting there, and you smell the stink, your brain is designed to not like that.
[00:14:22.474 --> 00:14:23.014]  Okay?
[00:14:23.074 --> 00:14:25.494]  Men are designed to kill other men.
[00:14:25.514 --> 00:14:33.956]  And we are designed, if it's done in a proper way, and the brain recognizes that, that you're not going to feel bad about it.
[00:14:36.099 --> 00:14:48.108]  But, when you are the bad guy, and when your brain, and believe me, you may consciously lie to yourself, but the subconscious knows, your soul knows, when you go out and you kill innocent people, you're going to feel bad about it, and it's going to ruin your life.
[00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:51.411]  And no amount of Prozac, and no amount of amnesiacs is going to help you.
[00:14:52.271 --> 00:14:54.653]  Now, there have been lots of amnesiacs out there.
[00:14:55.234 --> 00:15:01.558]  You know, you can go have sedation dentistry done, and they'll give you a big dose of Halcyon, and you're not going to remember that you just had your wisdom teeth ripped out.
[00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:03.660]  You're going to be fully conscious during the procedure.
[00:15:05.433 --> 00:15:10.580]  And they've been testing Halcyon and other drugs and more advanced drugs on the trips after they do things.
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:24.317]  And so this turns the trips into robots where they come back and they're going to be depressed, they're going to feel bad about it, and they give them an amnesiac, which by the way really over time causes serious brain damage, these really high-powered ones, and it wipes out your memory.
[00:15:25.582 --> 00:15:26.863]  These are mind control drugs.
[00:15:27.204 --> 00:15:39.254]  The drugs they're using in association with this were used in the 50s and 60s and 70s with MK Alter, MK, Naomi and other declassified CIA mind control programs.
[00:15:40.291 --> 00:15:42.532]  Amnesics are a big part of that.
[00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:44.712]  They're also used in hypnotizing them.
[00:15:44.932 --> 00:15:54.395]  And they go on to say the military is also, while they're on them, putting them in with headphones on, telling them how good they are, and they've done a good job, and they're a good person, and they should feel good.
[00:15:55.035 --> 00:15:56.095]  That stuff's not going to work.
[00:15:56.295 --> 00:15:58.236]  Later, it's going to come bubbling out of them.
[00:16:00.077 --> 00:16:15.288]  You know, they've had people in Delta Force units that are at these torture facilities in Afghanistan, overseeing security, and they've seen people being tortured, and people being killed, and thousands being killed in outdoor containers, and they flip out later and come home and kill their whole families.
[00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:22.152]  Because they hate themselves, and they want to hurt themselves, so they kill their children.
[00:16:22.212 --> 00:16:23.954]  Boy, you've got to really hate yourself to do that.
[00:16:24.814 --> 00:16:25.915]  To kill your wife and children.
[00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.271]  So it isn't going to work, okay?
[00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:29.512]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:16:29.852 --> 00:16:32.834]  There's a very small percentage of the population that is psychopathic.
[00:16:33.014 --> 00:16:33.974]  They're born that way.
[00:16:34.314 --> 00:16:34.935]  It's genetic.
[00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:38.637]  You can also program some of those traits into people.
[00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:42.939]  But generally, they'll have some sick system, psychologically, that allows them to do this.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.820]  And it just isn't going to work, okay?
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.581]  You can't do it.
[00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:46.321]  It isn't going to work.
[00:16:48.743 --> 00:16:50.784]  You're going to totally fry these people even more.
[00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:55.061]  But it reminds me of the first Matrix.
[00:16:55.101 --> 00:16:59.643]  The second and third Matrix, I don't like too much, but the first Matrix is a masterpiece.
[00:17:00.223 --> 00:17:04.145]  You've got the guy who's betraying the people in the real world who are outside the Matrix.
[00:17:04.866 --> 00:17:12.910]  And when he plugs into the Matrix, he goes and visits with the agents of the computer, of the architect, Lucifer, that you learn in the third episode.
[00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:15.851]  And it was the machine, basically the devil.
[00:17:17.552 --> 00:17:18.773]  That's the archetypes they use.
[00:17:20.888 --> 00:17:21.748]  Pretty blasphemous.
[00:17:21.788 --> 00:17:27.949]  Jesus is Neo, and Neo is Jesus, and God, and all this other business.
[00:17:29.169 --> 00:17:32.730]  But the first one's good.
[00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:38.171]  And he's meeting at a restaurant in the imaginary world of his mind, but perception is reality, they teach us.
[00:17:39.111 --> 00:17:48.353]  And he goes in, and he's sitting there eating his steak and drinking his red wine, and he's telling the agent, I don't remember anything after I betray, you know, this
[00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:55.098]  Hovercraft that cruises around, you know, plugging into the Matrix, hacking into the Matrix.
[00:17:55.638 --> 00:18:03.644]  After I betray my friends and betray the underground base where the 100,000 humans are left, since the machines took over, who aren't plugged into the Matrix.
[00:18:04.804 --> 00:18:05.825]  I don't want to remember anything.
[00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:07.026]  I want it totally erased.
[00:18:07.046 --> 00:18:09.528]  I want to be a movie star, and I don't want to remember anything.
[00:18:11.109 --> 00:18:12.810]  And I want to be totally erased.
[00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.231]  I want my memory of this erased.
[00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:17.573]  And that's exactly what people are trying to do.
[00:18:18.576 --> 00:18:33.625]  I mean no wonder you're 50 years old and you stuck your grandmother in a nursing home, you stuck your mother in a nursing home and she died of bed sores and you know you got her $500,000 but you went and bought a new Cadillac and you bought a bigger house but you're totally unhappy.
[00:18:34.606 --> 00:18:43.151]  You would be happy if you were down there with all the drug addicts in a soup line making them hot food and smelling the vomit all over them.
[00:18:44.452 --> 00:18:44.632]  Why?
[00:18:44.672 --> 00:18:45.773]  Because you're meant to nurture.
[00:18:45.793 --> 00:18:46.674]  You're meant to help people.
[00:18:46.914 --> 00:18:47.875]  It's how you're designed.
[00:18:48.115 --> 00:18:51.457]  You're not going to be happy, you know, running around.
[00:18:51.477 --> 00:18:59.983]  So you're 50 years old, and you put your mama in a nursing home, and you know deep down that they didn't take care of her, and you didn't see her enough, and she died.
[00:19:00.324 --> 00:19:05.027]  And when you used to go see her, she begged you to come see her more, and she'd cry and throw fits.
[00:19:05.067 --> 00:19:13.153]  So they said that she was mentally ill, so they put her on drugs that killed her quicker, instead of hitting your knees and asking God to forgive you and admitting the evil you've done.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.241]  And Lord knows we've all done evil stuff, folks.
[00:19:17.101 --> 00:19:24.024]  Instead of admitting the evil you've done, you are using the natural denial you've got to stick that deep in your heart.
[00:19:24.064 --> 00:19:24.545]  But you know what?
[00:19:24.585 --> 00:19:25.945]  You're going to self-destruct yourself.
[00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:27.466]  Your body doesn't like you.
[00:19:27.526 --> 00:19:28.446]  Your brain doesn't like you.
[00:19:28.506 --> 00:19:30.307]  It's going to tell you to get cancer.
[00:19:31.028 --> 00:19:32.468]  By the way, all the major studies show this.
[00:19:32.488 --> 00:19:33.169]  This is science.
[00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:35.290]  You're going to kill yourself.
[00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.451]  And I don't mean by slitting your wrist or throwing a bunch of Prozac down your throat.
[00:19:38.711 --> 00:19:40.332]  Your brain is going to self-destruct you.
[00:19:40.962 --> 00:19:42.063]  Because you're bad for the tribe.
[00:19:42.323 --> 00:19:44.405]  You're bad for humanity and you need to get the hell out of the way.
[00:19:44.425 --> 00:19:45.106]  Excuse my French.
[00:19:45.606 --> 00:19:47.688]  Or you can repent and come back to humanity.
[00:19:48.108 --> 00:19:49.509]  So that's what these drugs are all about.
[00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:50.831]  And it's not going to work.
[00:20:02.046 --> 00:20:05.628]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:20:05.648 --> 00:20:06.169]  are located?
[00:20:06.369 --> 00:20:09.771]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:14.694]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:20:14.974 --> 00:20:19.977]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:20:20.277 --> 00:20:20.597]  I think so.
[00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:39.150]  We're good to go.
[00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:03.820]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:09.242]  Today is March 26, 2007 and gold is at $667.50 and 1 oz gold coins can be purchased for $699.21, $344.51 for 1 oz and $172.25 for 1 oz coins at $699.21, $344.51 and $172.25.
[00:21:20.307 --> 00:21:23.931]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[00:21:23.991 --> 00:21:27.014]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[00:21:27.094 --> 00:21:36.282]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[00:21:36.603 --> 00:21:41.928]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[00:21:42.388 --> 00:21:44.689]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[00:21:44.749 --> 00:21:47.210]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.251]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:21:49.311 --> 00:21:51.191]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[00:21:51.271 --> 00:21:51.572]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.032 --> 00:21:52.572]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.471 --> 00:22:06.253]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[00:22:06.473 --> 00:22:10.455]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[00:22:10.715 --> 00:22:17.017]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:22:17.257 --> 00:22:21.639]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.

[00:22:27.381 --> 00:22:32.885]  Getting yourself onto solar power is one of the most liberating things you can do for yourself and your family.
[00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:40.811]  The solar-powered generator will run your lights, fan, electric blanket, your refrigerator, and a whole slew of household items.

[00:23:02.467 --> 00:23:04.549]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:05.169 --> 00:23:14.095]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:14.535 --> 00:23:21.740]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:22.455 --> 00:23:27.938]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:48.568 --> 00:23:51.050]  Or, visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:51.931]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:23:52.271 --> 00:23:55.073]  Steve Austin, astronaut.
[00:23:55.093 --> 00:23:56.695]  A man barely alive.
[00:24:14.115 --> 00:24:16.836]  Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.
[00:24:16.856 --> 00:24:19.716]  We have the technology.
[00:24:19.776 --> 00:24:25.797]  We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man.
[00:24:27.718 --> 00:24:30.258]  Steve Austin will be that man.
[00:24:30.298 --> 00:24:33.299]  Better than he was before.
[00:24:33.519 --> 00:24:35.479]  Better.
[00:24:36.619 --> 00:24:38.240]  Stronger.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:38.760]  Faster.
[00:24:44.347 --> 00:24:46.248]  Drugging the death forces up!
[00:24:46.889 --> 00:24:56.014]  When they come back after murdering entire villages of men, women, and children as the army bragged in the Ithaca Journal, they did in Afghanistan.
[00:24:56.034 --> 00:24:59.716]  The army came out and clarified and said, yes, we do kill everyone in the entire village.
[00:25:00.456 --> 00:25:03.258]  And these big, bad, tough men go kill toddlers.
[00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:05.399]  And then they come back and they shut down.
[00:25:06.039 --> 00:25:07.320]  And life's over for them.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.141]  No amount of drugs is going to help them.
[00:25:09.818 --> 00:25:11.259]  So they try to come up with this stuff.
[00:25:12.339 --> 00:25:14.260]  By the way, I'm not going to continue with the news the next time.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.261]  We're going right to your calls.
[00:25:15.961 --> 00:25:18.982]  For everybody, John, Gail, Chris, James, Bob, others that are holding.
[00:25:20.143 --> 00:25:30.368]  They can come out with, for the general public, when you stick your parents in the nursing home and you can't live with yourself, and they're going to come up with drugs for the CPS workers when they snatch kids every day from crying families.
[00:25:30.668 --> 00:25:31.948]  Just pop one of these babies.
[00:25:31.968 --> 00:25:33.309]  You won't remember what you did yesterday.
[00:25:33.929 --> 00:25:35.050]  It's not going to help you.
[00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:37.631]  Start being moral again.
[00:25:37.731 --> 00:25:39.251]  Start caring about people again.
[00:25:39.551 --> 00:25:40.912]  Start having courage again.
[00:25:42.312 --> 00:25:43.433]  Fight the New World Order.
[00:25:43.493 --> 00:25:47.074]  Believe me, you'll sleep real good at night and you won't feel bad about yourself.
[00:25:47.394 --> 00:25:54.717]  I'm telling you, bottom line, when I was a teenager and even in college and still pretty much only cared about myself, I was not a happy camper, folks.
[00:25:54.817 --> 00:25:55.817]  I am extremely happy.
[00:25:56.297 --> 00:25:58.078]  I am just literally bouncing off of walls.
[00:25:58.478 --> 00:25:59.879]  I'm so energized in this fight.
[00:26:00.499 --> 00:26:01.339]  And I feel good.
[00:26:01.379 --> 00:26:03.440]  There's no post-traumatic stress disorder here.
[00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.331]  There's no wanting to forget what I've done here.
[00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:18.539]  The only regret is that I don't do enough, that I'm not good enough, that I'm not fighting hard enough, because when you're in a good war, when you're in a just war, there's no lying to yourself about it.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:27.625]  Okay, after we take calls, because I'll get to this first gamut of calls, and then we'll run that gauntlet and get back into the news.
[00:26:30.066 --> 00:26:31.968]  Big talk about impeachment of Bush right now.
[00:26:32.048 --> 00:26:32.428]  That really
[00:26:33.398 --> 00:26:35.759]  As much as I want that, he's still just a puppet.
[00:26:35.779 --> 00:26:36.639]  We have to remember that.
[00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:39.561]  We have to remember that Hillary and all the big frontrunners are pro-war.
[00:26:41.221 --> 00:26:43.422]  Also, the stocks fall on housing data.
[00:26:43.922 --> 00:26:46.644]  That ties in with oil prices hit 2007.
[00:26:47.284 --> 00:26:48.704]  Highs on Iran tensions.
[00:26:49.185 --> 00:26:51.105]  IMF to urge depreciation of dollar.
[00:26:51.505 --> 00:26:52.886]  That is the most important article.
[00:26:52.926 --> 00:26:53.806]  We'll cover that one.
[00:26:54.427 --> 00:26:57.268]  Really scary report about drones could defend airports.
[00:26:59.272 --> 00:27:00.433]  Talk about bionic man.
[00:27:00.994 --> 00:27:14.085]  The Air Force by 2011, they said this back in 2002, I don't know if they're going to reach this goal, but they're making strides towards it, want to have half of the Air Force fleet be drone operated, no humans on board.
[00:27:15.386 --> 00:27:26.916]  Or even if you have C-130s out flying around, they want those to be remote controlled and autopiloted with just a crew on board, basically like biological robots just to unload payloads and kind of babysit stuff.
[00:27:28.836 --> 00:27:34.618]  This allows tiny elites to do a lot of really bad things and gives them control.
[00:27:34.678 --> 00:27:35.918]  Well, we'll break it down later.
[00:27:35.938 --> 00:27:36.639]  It's very important.
[00:27:37.879 --> 00:27:40.920]  Massive hype on the situation with Iran.
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.881]  That really is the most important news we've got.
[00:27:43.901 --> 00:27:44.881]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:27:47.982 --> 00:27:51.464]  And then we get into the really serious reports here.
[00:27:51.964 --> 00:27:55.565]  The Trilateral Commission and others are calling for the North American Union
[00:27:57.029 --> 00:28:12.974]  Carbon tax, gas tax of course, and that is what we got from last September with the four year documents that got released out of the Security and Prosperity Partnership North American Union meeting, and the first agenda was keep it secret, second agenda was get the tax.
[00:28:13.394 --> 00:28:15.375]  That's why you see Al Gore doing all this right now.
[00:28:17.395 --> 00:28:25.258]  Also, government misconduct, not truthers, most insulting, the 9-11 heroes, victims,
[00:28:26.889 --> 00:28:31.210]  Toxic air, abusive recovery process, and pothole scandal is the real disgrace.
[00:28:32.371 --> 00:28:35.011]  And I hope you get the score from PrisonPlanet.com and get it out to everybody.
[00:28:35.891 --> 00:28:44.594]  This is a popular tactic used to shut down debate on behalf of debunkers, is to claim that asking questions about the official 9-11 story is insulting to the victims.
[00:28:44.634 --> 00:28:44.934]  And yet,
[00:28:46.022 --> 00:28:55.572]  It is the presenters of the myth, the government itself, that through the post 9-11 actions has inflicted the most misery and suffering upon ground zero heroes and victims.
[00:28:55.992 --> 00:28:57.414]  Very important report we'll go over.
[00:28:57.754 --> 00:29:01.098]  And then the most frightening science news of the day.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.982]  Now scientists create a sheet
[00:29:05.589 --> 00:29:10.532]  That's 15% human, and that's the male that dovetails with new scientists.
[00:29:10.952 --> 00:29:15.895]  Pig human chimeras, that's clones, contain cell surprise.
[00:29:16.355 --> 00:29:19.757]  It's a very naughty, naughty surprise.
[00:29:20.177 --> 00:29:25.520]  And then 9-11 remains possibly used on roads by the government, court papers, Reuters.
[00:29:26.021 --> 00:29:27.281]  More on Pat Tillman as well.
[00:29:28.082 --> 00:29:30.423]  JonesReport.com, InfoWars.net.
[00:29:32.184 --> 00:29:33.845]  Other websites, we'll be right back.
[00:29:50.854 --> 00:29:53.857]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.778 --> 00:29:57.461]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.468 --> 00:30:03.189]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:30:03.349 --> 00:30:04.590]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.672]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:30:08.032 --> 00:30:10.794]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:30:11.335 --> 00:30:18.079]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:31:00.487 --> 00:31:05.049]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:31:05.449 --> 00:31:08.391]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:31:08.711 --> 00:31:11.272]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:31:11.632 --> 00:31:16.454]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:31:16.834 --> 00:31:22.197]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:31:22.497 --> 00:31:25.478]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:31:25.658 --> 00:31:26.218]  We're good to go.
[00:31:49.068 --> 00:31:56.912]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:31:57.093 --> 00:31:59.834]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:32:01.155 --> 00:32:01.575]  Attention!
[00:32:01.695 --> 00:32:04.517]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[00:32:04.817 --> 00:32:09.119]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:09.419 --> 00:32:10.120]  Listen closely.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:16.163]  Seventy-seven GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product considered to be the single most
[00:32:16.403 --> 00:32:16.863]  We're good to go.
[00:32:33.377 --> 00:32:42.841]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:48.663]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[00:32:48.863 --> 00:32:52.444]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[00:32:52.665 --> 00:32:55.986]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:33:17.296 --> 00:33:23.900]  And to be clear, what I was saying 15 minutes ago, 10 minutes ago, men are designed to fight other men when they need to.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.062]  To defend your family, defend your tribe, and the extension is your country.
[00:33:28.102 --> 00:33:31.624]  I mean, you're being overrun by foreign troops trying to kill your family.
[00:33:31.905 --> 00:33:38.728]  You're going to be able to fight like a superhuman, and you're going to... I mean, people are always defending, always have the initiative.
[00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:40.950]  That's basic warfare science.
[00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:41.810]  We'll tell you that.
[00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:42.791]  The people attacking
[00:33:43.713 --> 00:33:48.176]  I never really have as much initiative, unless it's a video game culture, where they disconnect.
[00:33:48.196 --> 00:34:00.925]  You know, back in the 40's, well, back in World War I, a very small percentage, maybe 10% of people, would actually fire at long distance on men and kill them in the trenches.
[00:34:01.146 --> 00:34:02.827]  People just didn't like doing it.
[00:34:03.347 --> 00:34:11.393]  The French would look across at the Germans, the Germans would look across at the French, they'd have somebody in their sights, and it was hard to pull the trigger and kill somebody who had a family.
[00:34:12.145 --> 00:34:20.994]  Now, history shows when people were up close fighting with swords or axes or pikes, there was no problem killing somebody.
[00:34:21.014 --> 00:34:26.940]  When they're right up there trying to kill you, it's not hard to do because you're fighting for your life.
[00:34:28.972 --> 00:34:32.553]  Fighter bombers dropping bombs on buildings where they knew there were children.
[00:34:32.973 --> 00:34:38.495]  Bombers, bombardiers had a tendency with the first bombings of World War I and then World War II.
[00:34:39.695 --> 00:34:43.296]  The Germans when they were attacking London, this happened.
[00:34:45.497 --> 00:34:50.258]  Because it's hard to do that, but over time they found seasoned pilots would get to the point where they could.
[00:34:51.212 --> 00:34:56.316]  Or they were, say, Stuka bombers attacking formations of Russian tanks, invading Germany.
[00:34:56.336 --> 00:34:58.458]  By then, they didn't have a problem dropping them right on the tanks.
[00:34:59.499 --> 00:35:02.741]  And then along came Korea, and the number got up to 20-30%.
[00:35:02.781 --> 00:35:04.382]  And then Vietnam, 50-60% throughout that conflict it grew.
[00:35:08.243 --> 00:35:14.448]  Until now, troops fire at their enemy to kill them at close to 95% of the time.
[00:35:14.508 --> 00:35:16.430]  And they've hooked electrodes up, they've done the test.
[00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.850]  And why?
[00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:21.014]  Because you've got a generation that grew up with these shoot-em-up video games.
[00:35:21.134 --> 00:35:21.574]  I played them.
[00:35:22.475 --> 00:35:31.322]  Which are basically, that's what they sort of, you know, in the 50s, showing cops the pop-up targets, silhouettes of people popping up, because it creates instinctive firing.
[00:35:32.122 --> 00:35:38.244]  Well, we all played the video games where you're shooting aliens and shooting troops, and now they're so real it looks like it's really happening.
[00:35:38.644 --> 00:35:44.586]  And some kids do that ten hours a day, on average two or three hours a day, and they shoot them up in the military.
[00:35:44.626 --> 00:35:45.126]  Man, it's over.
[00:35:45.166 --> 00:35:51.648]  They'll shoot people all day long, ladies and gentlemen, but they still gotta walk up and see the dead babies, the dead women.
[00:35:52.268 --> 00:35:54.849]  And then it doesn't work because it's not a video game.
[00:35:57.483 --> 00:36:05.492]  But it doesn't matter, now they've got video games where you do kill women and children, and you rape women and get bonus cash, and you watch TV shows where Jack Bauer tortures people.
[00:36:05.812 --> 00:36:08.755]  And that's helping a little bit twist us over to the dark side, but not enough.
[00:36:09.036 --> 00:36:14.502]  Alright, let's get to your calls, then we'll get to all the news that I was just mentioning earlier.
[00:36:15.563 --> 00:36:17.505]  Let's talk to John in New York.
[00:36:17.605 --> 00:36:18.526]  John, thanks for holding.
[00:36:19.401 --> 00:36:22.202]  Alex, I can't believe I got through and that I'm speaking to you.
[00:36:22.242 --> 00:36:22.922]  I'm so honored.
[00:36:23.402 --> 00:36:25.123]  Well, I'm honored to talk to you, sir.
[00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:26.743]  I mean, please don't be honored to talk to me.
[00:36:26.763 --> 00:36:27.204]  Go ahead.
[00:36:27.624 --> 00:36:35.006]  I've been 9-1-1 aware for about going on a year now, and I can't believe how it's changed my life and how it's affected me.
[00:36:35.566 --> 00:36:38.507]  Again, I can't believe I've been so stupid and blind to what has happened.
[00:36:38.647 --> 00:36:40.368]  The truth will set you free, my friend.
[00:36:41.028 --> 00:36:41.748]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:36:41.788 --> 00:36:46.330]  And I just wanted to know if you were coming to New York at any time soon.
[00:36:47.395 --> 00:36:52.198]  I'll probably be up there for the sixth anniversary, but that'll probably be the soonest I'll be there.
[00:36:53.119 --> 00:36:55.220]  I want to give you a big brotherly hug, man.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.881]  I just thank you so much for all you've done.
[00:36:57.041 --> 00:36:57.881]  Well, thank you, my friend.
[00:36:57.901 --> 00:36:58.502]  What's on your mind?
[00:36:59.222 --> 00:37:13.691]  Well, as I go around in my daily life and as I talk to people in the supermarket or along the street, or I was just recently at my neighbor's daughter was at a play in her local high school and I was there and I was seeing people in the community and stuff.
[00:37:14.645 --> 00:37:17.526]  And of course, this whole tragedy is in the forefront of my mind.
[00:37:18.047 --> 00:37:26.171]  And I noticed that in talking to people, I think I wanted to encourage you and the listeners to prepare.
[00:37:26.851 --> 00:37:32.974]  I've been working myself on preparing sentences that are clear and exact and to the point.
[00:37:33.614 --> 00:37:42.578]  You know, and I noticed that some of the John Connors videos and the way he approaches people, like when we go, are you aware that 9-1-1 was an inside job?
[00:37:42.598 --> 00:37:43.819]  9-1-1 was an inside job.
[00:37:44.204 --> 00:37:46.586]  It's a little too abstract for them.
[00:37:46.606 --> 00:37:47.887]  It like overwhelms them.
[00:37:47.907 --> 00:37:48.327]  What do you mean?
[00:37:48.387 --> 00:37:49.628]  Inside job, blah blah blah.
[00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:58.716]  Rather, I find it really more successful to address the people directly about just the buildings crumbling in the way they did.
[00:37:59.476 --> 00:38:00.877]  You mean like ask them a question?
[00:38:00.917 --> 00:38:01.918]  Hey, do you remember on 9-11?
[00:38:01.998 --> 00:38:03.099]  I got a question for you.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.381]  How those buildings came down?
[00:38:05.401 --> 00:38:05.961]  Remember building 7?
[00:38:06.021 --> 00:38:07.002]  The big 47 story one?
[00:38:07.022 --> 00:38:07.503]  Why did it fall?
[00:38:09.588 --> 00:38:15.493]  Yeah, right, well I'd like to run a couple, one right, I would like to try one right on you right now.
[00:38:15.813 --> 00:38:17.534]  First I say to them, let's keep it like this.
[00:38:18.035 --> 00:38:20.417]  First I say to them, are you 9-1-1 aware?
[00:38:20.437 --> 00:38:22.358]  Ooh, that's a good term.
[00:38:22.859 --> 00:38:24.099]  Yeah, are you 9-1-1 aware?
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.562]  And then they look at, usually the response always is, what do you mean?
[00:38:27.682 --> 00:38:29.744]  That's like saying, are you environmentally conscious?
[00:38:31.365 --> 00:38:35.508]  And then usually I would, nine times out of ten the response is always, what do you mean?
[00:38:35.969 --> 00:38:38.671]  And then I say, like this, very succinct, I say,
[00:38:39.167 --> 00:38:53.839]  Are you aware of the fact that it was impossible for the planes to make the buildings crumble straight down into their own footprint at uninhibited gravitational free-fall speed?
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.742]  I've never thought this stuff through.
[00:38:56.782 --> 00:38:58.924]  I've never really thought about what I'm going to say here.
[00:38:58.964 --> 00:39:00.445]  That's one of the reasons why I called.
[00:39:00.485 --> 00:39:07.391]  I wanted to encourage everybody out there to prepare succinct, clear, lucid points
[00:39:08.021 --> 00:39:14.925]  That don't get into a wishy-washy, you know, conspiracy, because I hate when that term conspiracy comes up.
[00:39:14.945 --> 00:39:15.966]  You just state the facts.
[00:39:16.006 --> 00:39:17.586]  Did you know the hijackers were referring to U.S.
[00:39:17.626 --> 00:39:18.787]  military bases and were U.S.
[00:39:18.807 --> 00:39:19.467]  government agents?
[00:39:20.288 --> 00:39:21.028]  Right, exactly.
[00:39:21.569 --> 00:39:21.749]  Right.
[00:39:22.269 --> 00:39:31.935]  But the one about the way, the manner in which the buildings sell is so important because I've noticed it's the most successful way for people to really start thinking about it.
[00:39:32.475 --> 00:39:36.197]  Because everybody's got that subconscious memory of it not being right.
[00:39:36.883 --> 00:39:38.684]  That's right, that's right, that's really good.
[00:39:38.964 --> 00:39:40.585]  So let me try it again, let me show you how I said it.
[00:39:40.605 --> 00:39:49.688]  I said, it was impossible for the planes to make the buildings crumble straight down into their own footprint at uninhibited gravitational free fall speed.
[00:39:49.788 --> 00:39:51.569]  And then what do they normally say back to you?
[00:39:51.929 --> 00:39:53.270]  Hold on, I'll go one more further.
[00:39:53.310 --> 00:40:03.534]  I say, and that pre-placed controlled demolition explosives were laced throughout the entire structure, making it fall the way it did.
[00:40:04.167 --> 00:40:10.030]  Now, you practiced it a couple times, and there's a lot of key words that really light up the mind there.
[00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:10.750]  Crumble.
[00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:12.030]  Straight down.
[00:40:12.431 --> 00:40:13.071]  Footprint.
[00:40:13.831 --> 00:40:17.213]  Uninhibited gravitational free fall speed.
[00:40:17.673 --> 00:40:20.514]  It's a little bit long and cumbersome, but it registers in their mind.
[00:40:20.594 --> 00:40:21.154]  It's amazing.
[00:40:21.414 --> 00:40:23.255]  And then they really start thinking about it.
[00:40:23.875 --> 00:40:25.856]  How could it fall so quickly like that?
[00:40:26.717 --> 00:40:27.897]  And then they really get going.
[00:40:27.957 --> 00:40:31.959]  And then you send them to loose change and 911 mysteries, and off they are.
[00:40:32.466 --> 00:40:33.206]  It's amazing.
[00:40:33.426 --> 00:40:34.247]  It just really works.
[00:40:35.147 --> 00:40:36.227]  You keep it up, John.
[00:40:37.147 --> 00:40:39.988]  How did you wake up to 9-11?
[00:40:40.188 --> 00:40:42.049]  Internet.
[00:40:42.089 --> 00:40:50.211]  Somebody, a friend of mine at my church said to me, he said, and that's another line I get to hear, I said, I thought he was out of his mind.
[00:40:50.251 --> 00:40:51.311]  I said, what are you, crazy?
[00:40:52.051 --> 00:40:57.913]  And then, sure enough, I found it on the internet, and I watched Loose Change, and I saw 911 Mysteries,
[00:40:59.514 --> 00:41:10.717]  And when I got, I saw 9-1-1 mysteries first, and when I was three quarters of the way through that, when I saw the steel beam cut on that 45 degree angle, you hearing?
[00:41:10.897 --> 00:41:11.497]  Yeah, I'm listening.
[00:41:12.257 --> 00:41:27.061]  Uh, when I saw that, those beam, vertical beams cut on that 45 degree angle, I was pound, literally pounding my fists in front of my computer, livid and raging in anger.
[00:41:28.007 --> 00:41:29.529]  Yeah, it's pretty serious business.
[00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:30.590]  I appreciate your call.
[00:41:31.011 --> 00:41:38.419]  When you find out this stuff's real, my friends, when you find out that the government's behind the terror, when you find out they killed those people, A, you get angry.
[00:41:38.459 --> 00:41:40.482]  B, you realize, man, we're not safe.
[00:41:40.602 --> 00:41:43.065]  I mean, we got hardcore killers running things.
[00:41:44.019 --> 00:41:45.580]  And if they're doing this, what else are they doing?
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.602]  Well, they're destroying your country's sovereignty.
[00:41:47.842 --> 00:41:49.003]  They're erasing our borders.
[00:41:49.243 --> 00:41:52.786]  They're putting poisons in your air, water, and food, in your vaccines and medicines.
[00:41:53.627 --> 00:41:54.828]  They're going after your children.
[00:41:54.848 --> 00:41:55.989]  They're breaking up the family.
[00:41:56.329 --> 00:42:00.093]  Everything they're doing is to make you feel inadequate and break up your communities.
[00:42:00.593 --> 00:42:01.894]  And these are cold-blooded people.
[00:42:01.914 --> 00:42:02.795]  That's why they're in control.
[00:42:03.473 --> 00:42:04.635]  All right, now we've got to move quicker here.
[00:42:04.675 --> 00:42:07.821]  That was a great call, but we just spent six minutes with him.
[00:42:07.861 --> 00:42:09.804]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gail in Texas.
[00:42:09.824 --> 00:42:10.485]  Gail, go ahead.
[00:42:11.246 --> 00:42:17.477]  Alex, I just wanted to bring to your attention today there's an article by Jerome Carsey out linking the Attorney General
[00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:18.915]  I don't think so.
[00:42:34.657 --> 00:42:38.319]  Or, you know what, that's so big, we'll get Jerome Corsi, Dr. Corsi on.
[00:42:38.819 --> 00:42:41.601]  Specifically, how does it connect?
[00:42:41.661 --> 00:42:43.042]  Because I want to know now.
[00:42:43.262 --> 00:42:54.308]  It just states that they've had all this information through 2005, including our local government, and didn't want to prosecute the matter.
[00:42:54.984 --> 00:42:55.984]  Well, of course they don't.
[00:42:56.025 --> 00:42:56.885]  This is what they do.
[00:42:56.905 --> 00:42:57.905]  This is how they operate.
[00:42:57.925 --> 00:43:02.887]  I knew it would become a federal matter, but he's saying now that Gonzales covered this up?
[00:43:04.288 --> 00:43:05.989]  Slightly, yes.
[00:43:06.689 --> 00:43:09.670]  I'd appreciate it if you would get Mr. Corzine on.
[00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:13.912]  I've already called my representatives because this is very disgusting.
[00:43:14.492 --> 00:43:15.813]  Most of them are probably in on it.
[00:43:16.073 --> 00:43:16.833]  Thank you for the call.
[00:43:16.873 --> 00:43:17.554]  I appreciate it.
[00:43:18.794 --> 00:43:20.695]  Folks, I don't get up here on air.
[00:43:21.693 --> 00:43:25.634]  And say that the government runs giant child kidnapping rings for fun.
[00:43:25.654 --> 00:43:31.796]  You know, I don't get up here and list Dimecore and Halliburton as running giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:43:32.477 --> 00:43:35.438]  Because I pulled it out of a, you know, out of a gopher's hole.
[00:43:36.898 --> 00:43:44.981]  That's because it's come up in the BBC, the Associated Press, Reuters, the Chicago Tribune, and it scares the living daylights out of me.
[00:43:45.281 --> 00:43:46.861]  And again, I don't run, I fight.
[00:43:46.941 --> 00:43:47.682]  It's fight and flight.
[00:43:47.722 --> 00:43:48.782]  I found running doesn't work.
[00:43:50.194 --> 00:43:52.336]  And by scared, I mean it agitates me.
[00:43:53.036 --> 00:43:54.777]  It gets me hopping up and down, folks.
[00:43:55.558 --> 00:43:57.299]  I mean, I'm just like a gorilla here.
[00:43:57.339 --> 00:44:00.220]  I mean, I see people threatening little gorillas, I get mad.
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.322]  I mean, I'm like, what is your major malfunction?
[00:44:03.042 --> 00:44:09.026]  Okay, I want to see these people with their necks inside nooses, and I'll pull the lever, folks, and I'll go to sleep real good.
[00:44:09.286 --> 00:44:11.327]  I won't need any amnesia drugs to forget about it.
[00:44:12.408 --> 00:44:14.769]  I'll sit there and pull the lever all day long, and all night long.
[00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:15.930]  You understand?
[00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:17.471]  I'll pull the trigger!
[00:44:19.887 --> 00:44:25.930]  This scum has been breeding and breeding and breeding and breeding and breeding and breeding and breeding and growing.
[00:44:27.671 --> 00:44:41.358]  When we get up here and we say CPS kidnapped 3,000 plus missing children in Florida and they found a bunch of them overseas and a bunch of other ones dead, that came out in the Florida papers in 2002, 2003, and you've never heard about it since.
[00:44:42.658 --> 00:44:43.739]  It tears my guts out.
[00:44:46.554 --> 00:44:57.458]  And one of my staff even knows, one of the former guards at one of these places, who said, yeah, they had to get out of it because they weren't just raping the children in these places, they were selling them into prostitution.
[00:44:59.179 --> 00:45:00.599]  Let me explain something to you folks.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.000]  We've got a judge named Judge Jean Meir.
[00:45:04.021 --> 00:45:06.322]  Okay, and I'm not saying she's connected to any of this.
[00:45:07.342 --> 00:45:09.003]  Excuse me, I was coughing there.
[00:45:09.363 --> 00:45:10.763]  Let me get a drink of this tea here.
[00:45:12.868 --> 00:45:13.868]  A little bit of allergy there.
[00:45:14.929 --> 00:45:17.269]  The big family court judge.
[00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:35.415]  And Judge Jean Muir got appointed, got elected, what, ten years ago or whatever, and she, five years ago, she already had a giant juvenile justice center built, a sprawling complex they're always building onto, and probably end up being 500 stories tall and the size of the Atlantic Ocean by the time they're done.
[00:45:35.435 --> 00:45:37.895]  It's just sick.
[00:45:37.955 --> 00:45:39.016]  It's a gigantic facility.
[00:45:39.036 --> 00:45:39.996]  They're building more everywhere.
[00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:42.150]  And it has her name on it!
[00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:46.091]  I mean, imagine, you're in office a couple years and they build a gigantic facility with your name on it.
[00:45:47.871 --> 00:46:06.075]  And they go in and build courtrooms onto all the major schools, and she's got judges in all of them, and the kid is late to class three times, there's no law, they're not truant, she calls them in, screams at parents, or other judges do, it's been on the news, they sign forms, sign their kids over to probation, now when the kid does something else, they go to jail.
[00:46:07.536 --> 00:46:09.376]  They don't care about your children!
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.401]  It's a big business, folks.
[00:46:11.421 --> 00:46:12.242]  This is big money.
[00:46:12.842 --> 00:46:18.427]  And then they're going into the system, they end up getting on heroin, cocaine, they end up getting raped, end up getting AIDS, hepatitis.
[00:46:18.487 --> 00:46:19.307]  I mean, it's a hellhole.
[00:46:19.327 --> 00:46:22.130]  And it's the same all over the country.
[00:46:24.311 --> 00:46:24.632]  Alright?
[00:46:24.852 --> 00:46:31.197]  And they take kids every day into this town whose parents don't vaccinate them because they're poor, or don't know the law, or don't know how to fight for themselves.
[00:46:33.558 --> 00:46:35.179]  I mean, I live in the Soviet Union.
[00:46:35.199 --> 00:46:35.980]  They don't go after me.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.862]  I'm like the big mean bear that lives in the cave down the road and they kind of avoid me.
[00:46:39.922 --> 00:46:46.586]  They're out there like wolves and eating rats and mice and squirrels.
[00:46:47.286 --> 00:46:49.388]  By the way, did you know that's a real analogy?
[00:46:49.688 --> 00:46:51.569]  Wolves and coyotes mainly eat rodents.
[00:46:51.649 --> 00:46:52.369]  They don't usually.
[00:46:52.389 --> 00:46:54.231]  It's in the winter they go after the bigger game.
[00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:56.992]  So I don't want the funny colony going after wolves.
[00:46:57.012 --> 00:46:57.893]  Here's the analogy.
[00:46:57.933 --> 00:47:01.595]  The point is, the wolves are out there going after what's weak, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:02.443 --> 00:47:06.024]  And they do it all day and all night long and they get away with it with impunity.
[00:47:06.965 --> 00:47:12.327]  And they're going to get away with blowing your dollar out, taking your pension funds, everything you've got, putting you into forced work brigades.
[00:47:12.787 --> 00:47:13.568]  Unless we stop them.
[00:47:14.188 --> 00:47:17.709]  And then they will go hunt down the bears one by one in their caves, okay?
[00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:20.270]  I won't be here forever if they win.
[00:47:21.891 --> 00:47:23.332]  And they operate with impunity.
[00:47:24.792 --> 00:47:25.152]  Alright?
[00:47:25.212 --> 00:47:25.993]  I'm sick of it!
[00:47:28.534 --> 00:47:31.075]  Now, this came out years ago.
[00:47:32.245 --> 00:47:37.966]  There have been three prisons outside Austin, just in my memory, in the last five years that got shut down.
[00:47:38.246 --> 00:47:50.809]  They had a Wackenhut prison just right outside Austin and it was in the paper that they were videotaping raping the women and they were beating them and doing all this stuff and dealing drugs in the prison so they lost the contract.
[00:47:51.289 --> 00:47:57.410]  And then there was another prison north of Austin where the male guards were raping the male inmates.
[00:47:58.806 --> 00:48:01.990]  And they thought it was normal, so they videotaped it and didn't even hide it.
[00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:03.372]  I mean, that's how crazy they are.
[00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:04.574]  They now think it's normal.
[00:48:06.918 --> 00:48:10.383]  And stuff I don't even want to get into, but here's the Statesman Saturday.
[00:48:11.424 --> 00:48:13.748]  Juvenile's terms under scrutiny.
[00:48:14.585 --> 00:48:20.329]  Investigators say state should make sure no sentences were unfairly extended to announce terminations and arrest.
[00:48:20.889 --> 00:48:26.813]  So they're going after people, not on the raping, not on the child prostitution, not on all that stuff.
[00:48:27.073 --> 00:48:33.517]  They're going after them for extending their sentences, because again, they wanted to keep the beds filled to keep building more, to get bigger contracts.
[00:48:33.818 --> 00:48:37.380]  But they're going after them for that, instead of the really serious stuff.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:53.444]  Thousands of cases at the troubled Texas Youth Commission should be reviewed to determine whether inmates should be released immediately because their sentences were improperly extended by agency staff or cannot be justified.
[00:48:53.484 --> 00:48:56.585]  Governor Rick Perry's special master recommended Friday.
[00:48:56.625 --> 00:48:57.806]  Yeah, Governor Rick Perry.
[00:48:59.046 --> 00:49:00.807]  He's really going to do something about this.
[00:49:02.987 --> 00:49:04.068]  I mean, come on, folks.
[00:49:04.108 --> 00:49:06.268]  If you know anything about people in Austin, they know.
[00:49:06.308 --> 00:49:09.329]  It's like... I mean, these people, man.
[00:49:09.369 --> 00:49:09.809]  These people.
[00:49:10.629 --> 00:49:18.612]  Jay Kimbrough, who has been assigned to investigate allegations that agency employees molested teenage inmates.
[00:49:19.212 --> 00:49:19.872]  Allegations?
[00:49:19.932 --> 00:49:20.792]  It's been admitted!
[00:49:21.172 --> 00:49:22.893]  But see, this is how they whitewash stuff.
[00:49:24.776 --> 00:49:34.082]  Assigned to investigate allegations that agency employees molested teenage inmates and covered it up, said 93% of all inmate sentences were extended and should be reviewed for fairness.
[00:49:34.102 --> 00:49:35.904]  There are about 4,700 inmates.
[00:49:36.344 --> 00:49:40.827]  He also disclosed that 111 agency employees had felony arrest.
[00:49:41.347 --> 00:49:45.010]  It's like CPS and Florida, the top three, were child rapists.
[00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:50.133]  These aren't just, you know, people who are 18 who had a 17-year-old girlfriend, folks.
[00:49:50.614 --> 00:49:53.656]  I mean, these are hardcore people who should be executed.
[00:49:54.486 --> 00:49:57.767]  Okay, but no, no, no, no.
[00:49:57.807 --> 00:49:58.868]  They run things.
[00:49:59.208 --> 00:50:00.268]  Don't you understand?
[00:50:01.228 --> 00:50:07.911]  It's been in the news for five years that the Army's hiring hardcore, aggravated felons, rapists, and arsonists.
[00:50:08.351 --> 00:50:09.912]  This is who's going to run our lives.
[00:50:09.932 --> 00:50:10.572]  Do you understand?
[00:50:10.812 --> 00:50:12.172]  A lot of cops are felons.
[00:50:13.393 --> 00:50:20.415]  He also disclosed that 111 agency employees have felony arrest or convictions involving offenses that range from homicide.
[00:50:20.435 --> 00:50:21.956]  You hear that?
[00:50:23.098 --> 00:50:24.039]  Homicide.
[00:50:24.059 --> 00:50:29.803]  To theft, to writing bad checks, in addition to 437 had misdemeanor arrest or charges.
[00:50:30.123 --> 00:50:32.685]  The agency has about 4,600 employees.
[00:50:33.165 --> 00:50:41.050]  In a wide-ranging briefing to reporters, Kimbrough said that two agency officials, a lawyer and a former chief inspector, were terminated.
[00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:46.174]  And it goes on here, see, it doesn't call it rape with these children, it's called sex.
[00:50:47.775 --> 00:50:51.117]  Like the Army report says that they had forced sex with children.
[00:50:52.088 --> 00:50:53.589]  Well, that's called rape.
[00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:57.211]  But that's who runs things, folks, and they're just getting started!
[00:50:57.231 --> 00:51:07.197]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:07.537 --> 00:51:09.498]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:09.859 --> 00:51:17.483]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.197 --> 00:51:25.240]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:37.085]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.365 --> 00:51:41.047]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.347 --> 00:51:43.288]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.608 --> 00:51:47.450]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:57.496 --> 00:53:59.277]  Working with the power of nature.
[00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:07.402]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.062 --> 00:54:10.384]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:14.272 --> 00:54:19.354]  Okay, last Friday I saw an article where they're going to use the driver's license for debit cards.
[00:54:19.414 --> 00:54:20.375]  Now, I always told you.
[00:54:20.395 --> 00:54:21.755]  I don't know how many times I've told you.
[00:54:22.055 --> 00:54:31.339]  I saw federal plans and over a decade ago that they were going to use the driver's license as the national ID card.
[00:54:31.359 --> 00:54:32.179]  That's now the case.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:34.160]  It's already law.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.681]  They say it goes into effect next year.
[00:54:35.721 --> 00:54:36.421]  That's not the case.
[00:54:36.461 --> 00:54:38.522]  It's been in law with executive orders since the mid-90s.
[00:54:39.437 --> 00:54:44.665]  Want to get Technical 93, but wasn't put into place in most states until about 96, and now all states have adopted.
[00:54:45.347 --> 00:54:46.949]  Now, have they added the tracker chip yet?
[00:54:47.129 --> 00:54:48.512]  No, that's what they claim is new.
[00:54:49.489 --> 00:54:55.431]  And you're going to have a national sales tax, and this is the fair tax that the idiot mainline conservatives are pushing.
[00:54:55.451 --> 00:54:56.691]  They have no idea what they're doing.
[00:54:57.031 --> 00:55:03.994]  They're going to keep an income tax along with it, just change the name, and reduce it for now, and then give you the new 20 to 25 percent tax.
[00:55:04.294 --> 00:55:16.918]  It's going to be graduated, though, so if you're quote, poor, you're not going to have to pay, but then there's going to be people cheating, getting people who are poor to buy big ticket items for them with no sales tax, so that's all got to be monitored, and then you've got to have federal control over every terminal and every purchase.
[00:55:17.518 --> 00:55:21.061]  Total federalization, and that goes into an international tax.
[00:55:21.141 --> 00:55:24.644]  Kevin just saw the ad for local TV, and they were saying just that.
[00:55:25.004 --> 00:55:26.325]  Texas driver's license.
[00:55:26.805 --> 00:55:28.006]  Now they've already been getting you ready for this.
[00:55:28.026 --> 00:55:31.629]  I'll tell you about 75 year old ladies having to swipe their cards to buy cigarettes or beer.
[00:55:31.649 --> 00:55:33.130]  I mean, I've seen this.
[00:55:33.871 --> 00:55:36.152]  And this is already in the database.
[00:55:36.313 --> 00:55:37.033]  It's already there.
[00:55:37.413 --> 00:55:38.414]  And just like Finland.
[00:55:38.474 --> 00:55:40.516]  Finland was doing this six, seven years ago.
[00:55:41.295 --> 00:55:41.815]  I learned of it 6-7.
[00:55:41.916 --> 00:55:43.176]  They've been doing it for 10 years.
[00:55:43.597 --> 00:55:50.101]  Finland, you've got to use your driver's license to buy everything, or your ID card, and your bank account is a government account.
[00:55:50.882 --> 00:55:51.882]  Okay, that's how it works.
[00:55:52.142 --> 00:55:54.024]  Kevin, you saw the piece.
[00:55:54.044 --> 00:55:54.924]  You were waving your arms.
[00:55:54.944 --> 00:55:55.465]  Tell us about it.
[00:55:56.085 --> 00:55:57.306]  Do you ever get tired of being right?
[00:55:58.237 --> 00:56:02.579]  I mean, just on every single thing, five years, six years ahead of the time.
[00:56:02.599 --> 00:56:04.280]  Well, I mean, I just read what they said they're going to do.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:04.840]  Exactly.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:08.462]  And there's going to be a piece on tonight on local Fox News.
[00:56:09.642 --> 00:56:14.564]  I'd imagine that it'll probably be on other Fox affiliates around the country at exactly the same time.
[00:56:14.584 --> 00:56:15.845]  That's the way Fox usually does it.
[00:56:16.605 --> 00:56:22.408]  They had this dingbat lady with goggle eyes standing out in front of the gas pump going, oh, this is incredibly convenient.
[00:56:22.428 --> 00:56:24.209]  I can't believe how easy this is going to be.
[00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:27.912]  I can actually use my driver's license now as a debit card.
[00:56:27.972 --> 00:56:31.173]  And of course that ties into data banks and your bank accounts with the government.
[00:56:31.454 --> 00:56:35.356]  Now they've got the new points system where you get three tickets in three years and you pay thousands.
[00:56:35.696 --> 00:56:37.377]  I mean, you just get ready, fools.
[00:56:38.249 --> 00:56:39.250]  Absolute idiot morons!
[00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.770]  What was that?
[00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:43.771]  A year or two ago we had one of our moles working at TxDOT.
[00:56:44.332 --> 00:56:50.534]  That was already four years ago and I want to find the video of that because I showed it on TV and I can't find it.
[00:56:52.135 --> 00:56:58.058]  I know it's in a weekly TV report but I was looking around and I couldn't find which one it was and it's somewhere around the office but he was a mole.
[00:56:59.138 --> 00:57:03.560]  The original is somewhere around here and this was four years ago and he shot video of the internal TxDOT
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:04.461]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:57:27.891 --> 00:57:30.935]  Employee information, people that were applying for jobs at TxDOT.
[00:57:31.035 --> 00:57:32.637]  Yeah, but that's the same thing they got at DPS.
[00:57:32.697 --> 00:57:34.058]  And that is exactly that.
[00:57:34.159 --> 00:57:38.083]  So here we go, whether it be taxation, points, ticketing.
[00:57:38.263 --> 00:57:39.985]  You've got another state doing it too right there.
[00:57:40.586 --> 00:57:42.689]  It's Washington, another pilot program.
[00:57:43.667 --> 00:57:55.257]  It's just, here it is, Washington State to test enhanced license you can buy with, and of course, this is the new North American ID card, and go ahead and say it's convenient, stick your yuppie thumb in your fat mouth and just enjoy it.
[00:57:55.618 --> 00:58:05.947]  And like I said, they've devalued your dollar, they're going to take everything you've got, and you could have woken up and saved this country, but you wanted to listen to Neil Bortz and Sean Hannity and Hillary Clinton, and so you're going to get it.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:11.964]  Well, I saw the other day, apparently we haven't depreciated the dollar enough yet.
[00:58:12.204 --> 00:58:13.905]  IMF, I'm going to cover that in the next hour.
[00:58:13.925 --> 00:58:14.446]  Thanks, Kevin.
[00:58:14.466 --> 00:58:15.226]  You bet, you bet.
[00:58:15.246 --> 00:58:15.787]  Appreciate it, man.
[00:58:15.807 --> 00:58:21.090]  Everybody around the country, keep your eyes open for this same story in your locality, alright?
[00:58:21.351 --> 00:58:27.255]  And we do have Dr. Corsi joining us on Gonzalez covering up the child rape rings.
[00:58:28.103 --> 00:58:29.224]  I mean, I have the article here.
[00:58:29.264 --> 00:58:31.545]  It's just, you know, what do you get with these people?
[00:58:31.846 --> 00:58:32.426]  Who rules us?
[00:58:32.846 --> 00:58:34.267]  They carry out terror attacks, folks.
[00:58:34.287 --> 00:58:35.148]  They're not nice people.
[00:58:35.728 --> 00:58:36.869]  We'll come back right after your call.
[00:58:36.889 --> 00:58:39.931]  Stay with me.
[00:58:41.112 --> 00:58:45.335]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:56.992 --> 00:59:01.195]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:01.835 --> 00:59:02.656]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.416 --> 00:59:04.277]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.297 --> 00:59:08.599]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:13.282]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.023 --> 00:59:17.965]  Well, Iran is looking worse and worse by the minute.
[00:59:18.005 --> 00:59:21.848]  We have a huge stack of news in that area that we'll be covering in great detail.
[00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:26.772]  In the third hour, I wasn't going to have guests on today, but a caller mentioned it, so we checked into it.
[00:59:27.272 --> 00:59:30.534]  Embattled Attorney General now accused in sex scandal cover-up.
[00:59:30.554 --> 00:59:34.936]  Attorney General Gonzalez among officials who allegedly ignored abuse of minor boys.
[00:59:36.097 --> 00:59:38.398]  This just keeps coming up with the White House, doesn't it?
[00:59:38.978 --> 00:59:41.400]  Back into the 80s, and it'll never stop.
[00:59:43.301 --> 00:59:45.061]  Until these people are brought to justice.
[00:59:46.162 --> 00:59:51.485]  But don't expect old Rick Perry to be involved in fighting this.
[00:59:52.774 --> 00:59:54.595]  He just tows the line as well.
[00:59:55.516 --> 00:59:58.157]  And I just covered a bunch of news about that in the last hour.
[00:59:58.177 --> 01:00:03.060]  This is how these people operate.
[01:00:04.141 --> 01:00:04.921]  It's what they do.
[01:00:05.221 --> 01:00:06.842]  Protecting the predators.
[01:00:06.982 --> 01:00:09.204]  Wonder why they protect the predators.
[01:00:11.245 --> 01:00:13.266]  Well, we know they're predators against our Republic.
[01:00:14.006 --> 01:00:15.127]  Busy dismantling it.
[01:00:16.118 --> 01:00:27.501]  And I did just confirm Fox News tonight is going to be reporting about how your driver's license will be used as your debit IDs and you'll be making your purchases with your government ID card and in the future they'll put little creds on it.
[01:00:28.141 --> 01:00:31.362]  You'll have to serve the government to get the proper amount of money to live.
[01:00:31.382 --> 01:00:37.624]  God, I get real cynical and smart mouth about it all, but it's really depressing, man.
[01:00:37.664 --> 01:00:38.384]  I'm freaked out.
[01:00:39.116 --> 01:00:40.937]  I mean, I don't like being right about this stuff.
[01:00:40.977 --> 01:00:42.459]  I don't like knowing their plan.
[01:00:42.479 --> 01:00:43.760]  I just, I can't believe it.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:50.424]  I can't believe there are this many bad people, but there's all these weak little chicken necks who want power and will do whatever it takes to get it.
[01:00:50.445 --> 01:00:56.009]  And then there's all these sickos who love just unmitigated power and to have their way and to hurt innocents.
[01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:59.852]  And they just need to, they need to be thrown right in the pit of hell.
[01:01:01.052 --> 01:01:04.355]  I mean, I guarantee you folks, you let me pull the lever, I would.
[01:01:04.375 --> 01:01:05.896]  There was a trap door under every one of these people.
[01:01:05.916 --> 01:01:07.978]  I could just pull the lever and they'd all drop right into hot lava.
[01:01:08.058 --> 01:01:08.458]  I'd do it.
[01:01:09.321 --> 01:01:10.161]  I've had enough of it.
[01:01:10.961 --> 01:01:17.943]  Somebody's got to stand up for the weak and the innocent, and somebody's got to have... I mean, I'm honored to be on the front line.
[01:01:19.123 --> 01:01:26.684]  The New World Order can just crush me as flat as a pancake, and though I want to live my life and see things in the world, enjoy the good things in life, I'm just fine.
[01:01:27.044 --> 01:01:28.684]  I'm honored to be on the front lines.
[01:01:28.704 --> 01:01:32.325]  Whatever happens to me, it's in God's hands, because these people have to be brought to justice.
[01:01:34.805 --> 01:01:36.346]  I mean, I have to control myself right now.
[01:01:36.386 --> 01:01:37.666]  I just physically feel
[01:01:39.323 --> 01:01:41.405]  Just like a hurricane of anger.
[01:01:42.226 --> 01:01:44.707]  You know, where you just want to start punching holes in the walls.
[01:01:44.788 --> 01:01:48.710]  You want to just pick up huge desks and just throw them up against the wall.
[01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:50.612]  You want to just take on ten people.
[01:01:50.632 --> 01:01:55.596]  You ever had that feeling where you just want to take on ten people and you just know you can clean the clocks of ten people?
[01:01:56.877 --> 01:01:59.058]  I guess I am a macho person.
[01:01:59.118 --> 01:02:01.680]  I'm not into physical prowess.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.423]  It's just the way I feel and I want to express it.
[01:02:07.121 --> 01:02:10.082]  I'm one of those people who's had the feeling I could take on 10 people, and I have.
[01:02:10.262 --> 01:02:11.803]  I've taken on 15 people before.
[01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:16.784]  And I tell you this, it's that idea, it's that spirit that we all need.
[01:02:16.804 --> 01:02:23.726]  Because I couldn't clean the clock of one person who weighed 180 pounds if I wasn't in the right.
[01:02:24.547 --> 01:02:29.728]  But the time I had, a whole bunch of people think they could intimidate me and a bunch of people come up against me.
[01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:31.049]  I just went ahead and let them all have it.
[01:02:31.089 --> 01:02:32.009]  Let me tell you something, folks.
[01:02:32.169 --> 01:02:34.550]  There was nothing I couldn't do when I was fighting
[01:02:35.794 --> 01:02:36.334]  Well, I say 15.
[01:02:36.454 --> 01:02:39.456]  It was more than 15, but only 5 or 6 would get at me at one time.
[01:02:39.816 --> 01:02:44.778]  And when you've got that, when you've got people coming at you like that, it's just unlimited.
[01:02:44.898 --> 01:02:46.539]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:02:47.219 --> 01:02:50.500]  It's that same thing where a little woman can pick a Cadillac up, folks.
[01:02:50.961 --> 01:02:54.302]  And we've got to learn how to tie into that in our minds in the InfoWard.
[01:02:55.037 --> 01:03:02.102]  We've got to learn how to tie into that, that survival mode in this fight against the New World Order in the Info War.
[01:03:02.202 --> 01:03:17.233]  I mean aggressively email people, aggressively spam the web, aggressively get the info out, aggressively, aggressively get out there and just start savaging this scum in the Info War before we can get them physically.
[01:03:17.253 --> 01:03:20.335]  And believe me, there's nothing more I wouldn't like to do.
[01:03:21.377 --> 01:03:25.178]  Before we do that, we gotta wake the cattle up and show them who the real enemy is.
[01:03:25.738 --> 01:03:33.041]  We gotta take the mask off the enemy and let people see what they are, so we can then get about the real business.
[01:03:33.981 --> 01:03:36.482]  And you know what that real business is gonna be!
[01:03:37.662 --> 01:03:38.963]  Don't you, New World Order?
[01:03:40.763 --> 01:03:41.764]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:03:42.844 --> 01:03:48.286]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones, waging war on corruption.
[01:03:55.712 --> 01:04:01.159]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:01.519 --> 01:04:09.169]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:16.914]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.314 --> 01:04:28.720]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:32.501]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:34.943]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.263 --> 01:04:39.105]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.129 --> 01:05:55.550]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:59.352]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:05:59.752 --> 01:06:02.694]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:06:02.974 --> 01:06:09.357]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:06:09.417 --> 01:06:13.819]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:06:14.039 --> 01:06:18.422]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:06:18.582 --> 01:06:21.184]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:06:21.204 --> 01:06:23.966]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:06:24.426 --> 01:06:26.988]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:06:27.028 --> 01:06:31.271]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:06:31.331 --> 01:06:32.172]  Treasury bonds.
[01:06:32.452 --> 01:06:37.076]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:06:37.256 --> 01:06:42.060]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:50.707]  That's 1-888-XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:57.573]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:57.913 --> 01:07:00.195]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:11.281 --> 01:07:12.982]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:13.002 --> 01:07:14.042]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:07:14.182 --> 01:07:19.725]  I'm going to skip to the end because Nick in Vegas was saying he had a chance to confront Hillary Whorehouse Clinton.
[01:07:20.345 --> 01:07:21.045]  Nick, go ahead.
[01:07:21.065 --> 01:07:21.705]  You're on the air.
[01:07:22.386 --> 01:07:29.208]  Hey, before I get to that, I just want to let you know, if you haven't heard, the WTC blueprints have been released on the LeaseChange blog.
[01:07:29.228 --> 01:07:31.509]  I didn't know if you'd heard of that.
[01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.850]  Well, no.
[01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:37.632]  It was a building within a building and built, overbuilt, to sustain massive attacks.
[01:07:38.601 --> 01:07:40.422]  Yeah, it's like a 500 MB TOR file.
[01:07:40.442 --> 01:07:42.523]  If you go to the Leash Change blog, it has it up there.
[01:07:42.843 --> 01:07:46.524]  Okay, we'll snatch it up and magnify its transmission.
[01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:58.289]  Anyway, yeah, there's a healthcare forum here in Vegas on Saturday with Obama, Hillary, Edwards, Richardson, and it was supposed to be an open forum where you could ask questions.
[01:07:58.670 --> 01:08:01.151]  But of course, that's for public consumption on the TV.
[01:08:01.231 --> 01:08:01.871]  It's not really.
[01:08:02.551 --> 01:08:03.011]  Exactly.
[01:08:03.051 --> 01:08:03.912]  Totally staged.
[01:08:03.992 --> 01:08:05.673]  All the questions were submitted beforehand.
[01:08:05.733 --> 01:08:06.533]  Totally monitored.
[01:08:07.236 --> 01:08:15.403]  So, um, before Hillary went on stage, I got a chance to try to give her a quick handshake, and I asked her right to her face, why were you at Bilderberg?
[01:08:16.063 --> 01:08:18.085]  And she was completely shocked.
[01:08:18.105 --> 01:08:27.353]  The look on her face was priceless, and she, she paused for about two seconds, and it was just like, she freaked out, and was like, oh, it's nice to meet you, and she walked on stage.
[01:08:27.373 --> 01:08:30.435]  She's like, I got one that can see!
[01:08:30.735 --> 01:08:34.939]  And she like, pulled her shirt up, you know, to her wrist, and goes, I got one of them right here.
[01:08:35.726 --> 01:08:47.053]  Yeah, it was pretty funny, but after we got a chance to confront her again when she was leaving the complex, we bullhorned her real quick, but when she was leaving, you know, Secret Service, police everywhere.
[01:08:47.073 --> 01:08:53.797]  But basically, you know, just shout it out, you know, Build-A-Burger's going to be exposed, New Order's going to be exposed, you know, your lives are coming out.
[01:08:54.318 --> 01:09:01.522]  And there's a video of this up on youarenotfree.com, the letter U, the letter R. You are not free dot com.
[01:09:01.582 --> 01:09:02.943]  I tell you what, how long's the clip?
[01:09:03.843 --> 01:09:05.625]  It's about three minutes.
[01:09:06.285 --> 01:09:07.226]  Go snatch it up.
[01:09:07.586 --> 01:09:13.771]  We'll play some of it if the audio is audible, if it's good audio, if it's intelligible.
[01:09:14.272 --> 01:09:15.653]  It's youarenotfree.com?
[01:09:16.153 --> 01:09:19.616]  Yeah, the letter U, letter R, notfree.com.
[01:09:19.956 --> 01:09:20.396]  All right.
[01:09:20.937 --> 01:09:22.418]  We appreciate you, my friend.
[01:09:22.478 --> 01:09:22.938]  Take care.
[01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:28.443]  Yeah, everywhere these cockroaches go, literally everywhere now, they're being bullhorned and shouted down.
[01:09:29.187 --> 01:09:31.348]  And their free speech zones have been overturned in court.
[01:09:31.408 --> 01:09:32.609]  The people aren't shutting up.
[01:09:33.029 --> 01:09:34.050]  And we're not going to stop.
[01:09:34.150 --> 01:09:35.291]  And this is just the end of it.
[01:09:38.052 --> 01:09:38.793]  It's over for you.
[01:09:39.013 --> 01:09:39.813]  And it's going to come out.
[01:09:39.994 --> 01:09:41.394]  All your crimes are going to come out.
[01:09:41.935 --> 01:09:46.377]  Again, 80 plus percent of the American people hate you.
[01:09:46.998 --> 01:09:47.558]  Both parties.
[01:09:47.618 --> 01:09:48.659]  I know you're criminals now.
[01:09:48.679 --> 01:09:52.361]  We're going to get the other 16 percent.
[01:09:53.242 --> 01:09:54.082]  And we're not going to stop.
[01:09:54.642 --> 01:09:55.883]  We're going to expose you.
[01:09:55.923 --> 01:09:56.363]  Period.
[01:09:56.964 --> 01:09:58.385]  Chris in Georgia, you're on the air.
[01:09:58.425 --> 01:09:58.725]  Welcome.
[01:09:59.332 --> 01:10:03.555]  Hey, um, I just wanted to ask, I'm fairly new to, like, Infowars and Resistance Manifesto and all that.
[01:10:04.135 --> 01:10:06.616]  I'm pretty new to all this stuff, so if you want to answer this question, forgive me.
[01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:23.807]  Um, but I was recently watching the, uh, 9-11 rise of the police state, and I noticed that whenever you were talking about, uh, bin Laden's family being evacuated, you zoomed up on the southeastern part of the U.S., and you had, like, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and, like, number 2 was over the same part of Georgia that the, uh, Georgia Guidestones are located.
[01:10:23.827 --> 01:10:27.289]  And I just wondered, because, like, you didn't really say a lot about that, and I was wondering if there was any significance to that.
[01:10:27.808 --> 01:10:32.069]  Well, I mean, I believe you're talking about... We showed a map where they were flown out of.
[01:10:32.089 --> 01:10:33.489]  I mean, that's right outside Atlanta.
[01:10:34.050 --> 01:10:36.990]  Almost 7 million people now there in that metro area.
[01:10:37.050 --> 01:10:37.850]  Yeah, I live in a suburb.
[01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:39.911]  You're going to have a lot of flights out of that area.
[01:10:40.391 --> 01:10:45.332]  Yeah, well, I mean, this part that was actually over Ebertson, Georgia, which is about 90 miles east of Atlanta.
[01:10:45.872 --> 01:10:47.473]  Yeah, I really don't know what I can say.
[01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:49.753]  I mean, we just know they flew the Bin Ladens out of the country.
[01:10:50.293 --> 01:10:50.554]  Oh, okay.
[01:10:50.574 --> 01:10:50.774]  All right.
[01:10:50.794 --> 01:10:51.074]  Thank you.
[01:10:51.374 --> 01:10:51.714]  Thank you.
[01:10:51.754 --> 01:10:52.674]  I appreciate your call.
[01:10:53.054 --> 01:10:55.135]  And, you know, that's a great example of media spin.
[01:10:55.395 --> 01:10:56.115]  Let me break that down.
[01:10:58.158 --> 01:11:00.500]  It came out that the Bin Ladens were flown out of the country.
[01:11:01.361 --> 01:11:26.620]  And it was one of the few decent things that Michael Moore, three years after the fact, after it had been in Miami Papers and on Miami and other television stations, mainly in Florida, and then, you know, we covered it within a week of 9-11, it was in the news, 168, or is it 9, members of the Bin Laden family were flown out in the three days after 9-11 on multiple flights.
[01:11:28.866 --> 01:11:32.667]  And they flew out of Georgia, they flew out of New York, they flew out of Miami and surrounding areas.
[01:11:33.907 --> 01:11:41.748]  Now, they had Bandar Bush, that's his nickname, Prince Bandar, of the Royal Saudi family, who was the ambassador to the U.S.
[01:11:41.768 --> 01:11:46.269]  at the time, big buddies with the Bushes, vacations, hangs out with them, they call him Bandar Bush, that's his nickname.
[01:11:47.649 --> 01:11:55.271]  He went on Larry King Live and said, it's all lies, this is totally made up, I'll never forget the tape of it.
[01:11:55.751 --> 01:11:57.491]  I'll have to dig that out and play it, I've got it somewhere.
[01:11:58.616 --> 01:12:02.879]  And, uh, you know, we were flown out two weeks, they were flown out two weeks after.
[01:12:03.239 --> 01:12:04.520]  And then he showed a news article.
[01:12:05.201 --> 01:12:11.125]  Well, yeah, two weeks after there was another flight of some bin Laden connected people.
[01:12:11.785 --> 01:12:13.767]  So, see, they do bait and switches, folks.
[01:12:13.807 --> 01:12:14.668]  They do straw men.
[01:12:14.928 --> 01:12:16.709]  And they go, see, Michael Moore was wrong.
[01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:19.931]  These people flew out two weeks later.
[01:12:19.971 --> 01:12:24.514]  Well, you could go pull the Miami Herald article from the 13th.
[01:12:25.455 --> 01:12:26.316]  You could go pull them all.
[01:12:26.336 --> 01:12:27.837]  There was video of them getting on the planes.
[01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:36.517]  But see, they know you've got a willing Fox News slash CNN audience that doesn't want to believe that.
[01:12:36.597 --> 01:12:38.459]  So it doesn't even have to be good propaganda.
[01:12:38.679 --> 01:12:47.287]  It's just some excuse for these armchair quarterbacks out there, as America goes under the waves, to just, oh, everything's fine.
[01:12:47.347 --> 01:12:49.329]  See, that's that commie Michael Moore.
[01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:50.991]  See, that's not true.
[01:12:55.342 --> 01:12:59.483]  And they do that over and over and over and over and over again.
[01:13:00.323 --> 01:13:03.204]  And they do these bait and switches all the time.
[01:13:05.525 --> 01:13:08.305]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Texas.
[01:13:08.365 --> 01:13:09.306]  James, you're on the air.
[01:13:09.346 --> 01:13:09.686]  Welcome.
[01:13:10.426 --> 01:13:11.066]  Hello, Alex.
[01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:12.247]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:13:12.487 --> 01:13:13.107]  Thanks for calling.
[01:13:13.727 --> 01:13:15.067]  Keep up the good fight, man.
[01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:17.688]  You're like one of our only hopes.
[01:13:18.008 --> 01:13:20.449]  Well, we need you out there to take action or there is no hope.
[01:13:21.089 --> 01:13:21.429]  I do.
[01:13:21.489 --> 01:13:23.109]  I hit the message boards all the time.
[01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.650]  Good job.
[01:13:23.690 --> 01:13:24.090]  Keep it up.
[01:13:24.170 --> 01:13:25.130]  That's where I'm heading.
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:51.985]  What I want to say, I work in the medical field, and this drug that they're talking about, this memory suppressing drug, it's called Propranolol, and most of it's been used, it's also got a name called Enderol, and it's been around since the 1950s, and what they're doing is, it's not a very good beta blocker, and they're trying to bring it out as a new drug that it can do this, like they did with Welbutrin, and labeled it as Zyban,
[01:13:52.563 --> 01:13:57.884]  It's so well-butered to 95 bucks a prescription that people want to quit smoking when they could have bought the generic for $16.
[01:13:58.324 --> 01:14:01.545]  Now, how does Halcyon play in this?
[01:14:01.565 --> 01:14:03.385]  It's part of the amnesic family, right?
[01:14:03.425 --> 01:14:04.446]  Well, it has been.
[01:14:04.586 --> 01:14:12.507]  It can be used like that, but the main drug that they're using in these studies, supposedly using in these studies is Enderol, and it's been around since the 1950s.
[01:14:12.887 --> 01:14:15.408]  What is the Pentagon talking about secret drugs?
[01:14:16.095 --> 01:14:17.656]  Well, I don't know.
[01:14:17.716 --> 01:14:29.803]  I don't know what kind of stuff that is, but I do know that they're trying to market propranolol as this memory-suppressing drug to give it to people after some kind of traumatic... So are you a doctor, a nurse, or a pharmacist?
[01:14:30.663 --> 01:14:32.164]  I'm in the medical field.
[01:14:32.304 --> 01:14:33.485]  I'm like nursing.
[01:14:33.585 --> 01:14:34.085]  Yeah, nursing.
[01:14:34.965 --> 01:14:44.891]  But the other thing I wanted to talk about was... I'd been listening not too long ago back, and they had talked about Iran was going to go to the dollar.
[01:14:46.219 --> 01:14:50.483]  And I can't find anything about that right now.
[01:14:50.503 --> 01:14:53.165]  I know it's supposed to happen on the 21st, supposedly.
[01:14:53.225 --> 01:15:00.991]  Look, Iran's been trying for five years to set up an oil borist and demand trading in its petro sales.
[01:15:01.251 --> 01:15:02.872]  That is, you can't buy oil from Iran in the dollar.
[01:15:05.174 --> 01:15:10.855]  But all they do is pipeline it to another consortium, who then takes it in dollars.
[01:15:10.895 --> 01:15:13.576]  See, the dollar is still the world reserve currency.
[01:15:13.916 --> 01:15:17.897]  That's why the bankers have been able to print it like it's going out of style and run it up.
[01:15:17.937 --> 01:15:19.798]  But now the chickens are coming home to roost.
[01:15:20.158 --> 01:15:24.279]  Now everybody's heading for the door, quietly dumping dollars, and we're in bad shape.
[01:15:24.299 --> 01:15:28.160]  I mean, do you think, did they outlaw it?
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:30.040]  Did they finally get it done in their country?
[01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:32.761]  Because there was some talk about it.
[01:15:33.186 --> 01:15:39.449]  I found some information on a German website and some on a British website, but there's nothing in there.
[01:15:39.569 --> 01:15:44.392]  I haven't confirmed that, but I know that they've moved off of it for the sale of oil.
[01:15:44.892 --> 01:15:45.313]  Of oil.
[01:15:45.473 --> 01:15:45.753]  Okay.
[01:15:46.293 --> 01:15:47.614]  Well, listen, I appreciate it, man.
[01:15:47.654 --> 01:15:48.914]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:15:49.055 --> 01:15:50.095]  I appreciate your call.
[01:15:50.415 --> 01:16:00.341]  Yeah, they took the most wealthy country with the biggest amount of savings and the largest middle class, and they sold us on globalization 40 years ago, and we've gone from the greatest
[01:16:02.711 --> 01:16:09.013]  Creditor nation is the greatest debtor nation, and now they took our last thing we had, our fiat currency, and they've devalued it by half.
[01:16:09.373 --> 01:16:12.194]  It's now over 50% to the pound.
[01:16:13.174 --> 01:16:15.235]  And they're going to fully trash it out more.
[01:16:15.655 --> 01:16:19.136]  And they've announced it, the bankers, the IMF.
[01:16:21.136 --> 01:16:26.398]  Again, I don't love money, but I do need money to fund what I do and to fight the new world order.
[01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:33.409]  And it's upsetting to know the little bit of money I've got in the bank account has been turned into toilet paper.
[01:16:34.049 --> 01:16:36.790]  And you talk to these yuppies out here, they just don't care.
[01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:37.491]  They don't know.
[01:16:38.271 --> 01:16:50.637]  And I guarantee you, when they totally pull the rug out from under us and finally tell them, these same slack-jawed people are going to be running around giving us advice and telling us and thanking whoever the fake saviors are on television.
[01:16:51.657 --> 01:16:52.838]  There's never an end to it.
[01:16:54.002 --> 01:16:56.264]  And I really want to slap these people upside the head.
[01:16:56.344 --> 01:16:57.905]  I mean, I don't want to talk to you anymore.
[01:16:58.126 --> 01:16:59.927]  I don't want to hear you, you ignorant fools.
[01:17:00.167 --> 01:17:00.428]  Okay?
[01:17:00.568 --> 01:17:02.990]  I know what's going on, because I've done the homework.
[01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:03.370]  Okay?
[01:17:03.650 --> 01:17:05.052]  And it isn't hard to do, by the way.
[01:17:05.232 --> 01:17:06.473]  That's what makes me mad about this.
[01:17:07.213 --> 01:17:09.936]  So, before you argue with me, you better have some facts.
[01:17:11.477 --> 01:17:12.818]  Life is not going to be good.
[01:17:12.838 --> 01:17:13.479]  Do you understand?
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.243]  Life is run... This country is run by some very bad people.
[01:17:19.724 --> 01:17:20.605]  Very bad people.
[01:17:24.679 --> 01:17:26.180]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Iowa.
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:27.000]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:28.981]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:17:29.781 --> 01:17:42.386]  You know, it's funny, I was on your website and I was, and it's not funny as comedy, this is ironic, that did you know that there's four or five countries that still do not have a central bank?
[01:17:42.886 --> 01:17:45.547]  They're Libya, Iran, Cuba, and North Korea.
[01:17:45.587 --> 01:17:46.808]  Yeah, it's all the rogue nations.
[01:17:47.261 --> 01:17:57.827]  Right now you don't hear about North Korea so much because they're kowtowing to, you know, we give them a little money and then they're going to, you know, take apart whatever, you know, weapons program they supposedly have that we gave them anyway.
[01:17:58.528 --> 01:17:59.008]  That's right.
[01:17:59.849 --> 01:18:01.089]  And same thing with Libya.
[01:18:01.129 --> 01:18:02.530]  Now we don't hear too much about them.
[01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:10.515]  Obviously they must have Gaddafi in a cave or maybe, maybe he's in the same cave with 750,000 that they pull out, you know, Saddam.
[01:18:10.995 --> 01:18:11.576]  Exactly.
[01:18:12.276 --> 01:18:15.198]  You know, if I look at Cuba now, Cuba 90 miles away.
[01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:22.591]  They still don't have a central bank, but obviously, we hear bits and pieces from time to time, but not so much.
[01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:24.872]  But the really one I want to concentrate on is Iran.
[01:18:24.892 --> 01:18:26.592]  Stay there, you're making great points, okay?
[01:18:27.132 --> 01:18:32.674]  And again, we're not saying that just because somebody is outside the New World Order that they're good.
[01:18:32.754 --> 01:18:34.614]  See, that's the trick the New World Order has.
[01:18:34.654 --> 01:18:38.115]  They're able to go, well look, Iran does some corrupt things, well look, North Korea's bad.
[01:18:38.615 --> 01:18:40.636]  Yes, show me government that isn't.
[01:18:41.136 --> 01:18:43.557]  You see, that's how they make themselves look good.
[01:18:44.361 --> 01:18:48.975]  No, you're just a more sophisticated model of what North Korea is, New World Order.
[01:18:49.397 --> 01:18:50.059]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.212 --> 01:18:58.175]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[01:19:52.971 --> 01:19:55.113]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.

[01:20:11.608 --> 01:20:15.231]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[01:20:15.291 --> 01:20:18.313]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[01:20:18.393 --> 01:20:27.580]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:33.224]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[01:20:33.684 --> 01:20:35.985]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[01:20:36.045 --> 01:20:38.506]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.

[01:21:27.244 --> 01:21:27.584]  I don't know.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:59.947]  I love the new sandal style, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:22:00.167 --> 01:22:04.191]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:22:04.451 --> 01:22:06.614]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[01:22:06.974 --> 01:22:08.916]  All Natural Non-X clears out the soil
[01:22:08.936 --> 01:22:09.156]  I think?

[01:23:31.209 --> 01:23:32.589]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:35.231]  We're talking to Bob in Iowa.
[01:23:36.431 --> 01:23:39.013]  Then we'll go to Todd, Lucas, Lynn, Michael, many others.
[01:23:39.593 --> 01:23:45.536]  In the next segment, I'm going to spend a few minutes, though, just going through the Iran news, the news on the economy, a lot more.
[01:23:45.556 --> 01:23:48.038]  But we're going to continue with open phones.
[01:23:48.078 --> 01:23:54.241]  Into the next hour, I'm going to get on for about 20-30 minutes, Dr. Jerome Corsi, on the breaking news with Gonzales involved in the
[01:23:55.706 --> 01:24:05.729]  sex ring prostitution cover-up here in Texas the Texas Youth Commission but right now let's go back to Bob.
[01:24:05.769 --> 01:24:06.349]  Bob go ahead.
[01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:08.030]  Thank you Alex.
[01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:11.051]  All I was basically saying is that we have Iran here.
[01:24:11.651 --> 01:24:24.615]  We know that we basically I see the government wanting to move with an excuse to overtake Iran and it's on several fronts and then basically just have the Middle East at our disposal so we're on China's doorstep.
[01:24:25.197 --> 01:24:31.180]  I don't think a lot of people, maybe your listeners are understanding this, but China has two and a half trillion dollars that they want to get rid of.
[01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:41.265]  In fact, it was just in the news, I think a week or two ago, that they're actually thinking of opening up an investment house because they were attaching Howard Dollars to their Wang, or whatever you call it, Yang, or whatever.
[01:24:41.285 --> 01:24:42.285]  They've already done that.
[01:24:42.405 --> 01:24:43.546]  No, no, that's official.
[01:24:44.026 --> 01:24:44.947]  Oh, that is official.
[01:24:44.987 --> 01:24:49.749]  Two weeks ago, they announced that they're going to dump at least a trillion
[01:24:50.573 --> 01:24:51.814]  In U.S.
[01:24:51.894 --> 01:24:54.055]  bonds, and in U.S.
[01:24:54.075 --> 01:25:07.820]  T-bills, and in debt they own, and part of that money is going to go for, you know, they've gotten all the, they didn't steal what was given to them by Boeing, their own airline fleets, everything, they're just going to stop pretty much investing in the dollar.
[01:25:09.321 --> 01:25:14.723]  But again, we have to be imploded to bring in the North American Union, and then all the crises they're going to set up,
[01:25:15.453 --> 01:25:17.535]  Oh, it's your fault for not having open borders.
[01:25:17.675 --> 01:25:18.516]  Oh, it's your fault.
[01:25:18.816 --> 01:25:20.457]  You need more New World Order.
[01:25:21.718 --> 01:25:28.623]  It's like if somebody beats you in the head with a sledgehammer and you're about to die and they say, Oh, it's because you weren't hitting the head with a sledgehammer enough.
[01:25:29.064 --> 01:25:29.884]  You need more.
[01:25:32.206 --> 01:25:32.807]  It's amazing.
[01:25:32.887 --> 01:25:40.773]  And it's just that, you know, through your videos that you've found definitely enlightened me on a lot of the things like, for example, I just watched Terror Storm.
[01:25:41.836 --> 01:25:48.800]  And one of the things that I saw on the website as well is that, um, you know, there was, um, I'm sure you remember, um, Abby Newman.
[01:25:49.341 --> 01:25:49.761]  Oh, yes.
[01:25:50.021 --> 01:25:52.102]  When she gets pulled over and everything like this.
[01:25:52.222 --> 01:25:56.605]  And the state police in Virginia think that the Bill of Rights is Al Qaeda.
[01:25:57.426 --> 01:26:05.971]  And what was interesting was, in reference to that, you know, the New York City is defined in the federal regulations as the United Nations.
[01:26:06.031 --> 01:26:11.094]  Rudy Giuliani stated on C-SPAN some time ago that New York City was the capital
[01:26:11.698 --> 01:26:12.278]  of the world.
[01:26:12.318 --> 01:26:13.198]  What do you think about that?
[01:26:13.398 --> 01:26:16.759]  Well, see, that's not a plus for the U.S.
[01:26:16.819 --> 01:26:18.819]  It means that we're being overtaken by them.
[01:26:18.839 --> 01:26:21.000]  Well, already have, don't you think?
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:22.760]  To a great extent.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.980]  And, by the way, New York is not the capital of the world.
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.061]  There's no debating that it's London.
[01:26:27.621 --> 01:26:28.201]  Right.
[01:26:28.301 --> 01:26:28.801]  Okay.
[01:26:28.821 --> 01:26:30.581]  Yeah, I would have to agree with you there.
[01:26:30.621 --> 01:26:33.082]  I'm going to have to come out with a real power.
[01:26:33.422 --> 01:26:39.323]  And the power sits, of course, in places like Tokyo and Paris and other places.
[01:26:39.383 --> 01:26:40.263]  But, I mean, for
[01:26:41.744 --> 01:26:46.569]  The biggest shareholders in the New World Order crime syndicate, and they literally own stock,
[01:26:47.616 --> 01:26:49.898]  It is the British slash Rothschild axis.
[01:26:50.379 --> 01:26:56.004]  Right, and that's what I was going to say earlier when you were mentioning about our dollar and about a lot of the things that have been eroding in the United States.
[01:26:56.344 --> 01:27:01.169]  It long ago was beginning with Rothschild and the European bankers and money changers.
[01:27:01.589 --> 01:27:03.831]  This has been something that's been going on for several hundred years.
[01:27:05.092 --> 01:27:08.655]  But don't worry, when they bankrupt us, they'll be the saviors and we'll worship them properly.
[01:27:08.916 --> 01:27:09.656]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:10.237 --> 01:27:13.079]  Let's go ahead and talk to Todd in Virginia, I believe.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:13.460]  Go ahead.
[01:27:14.432 --> 01:27:15.293]  Good day, Alex.
[01:27:15.333 --> 01:27:17.835]  I'm a little upset today on two subjects.
[01:27:18.276 --> 01:27:18.596]  Okay.
[01:27:19.277 --> 01:27:31.608]  First one, upset at myself, because the other day I was at work on the weekend and it was the first time I'd actually heard a group of people, about six of them in a circle, talking about the World Trade Center attacks.
[01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:39.476]  And actually for the first time I heard people in public at work discussing the theories and having an open discussion and they were getting a lot of the facts wrong.
[01:27:40.183 --> 01:27:45.046]  I just didn't have the courage to open my mouth and set them straight on a few things.
[01:27:45.126 --> 01:27:54.733]  And, you know, I think that's going to be something that we're all going to be facing a lot more of in the near future as these old Rosie O'Donnell and Charlie Sheen things make it more polite to talk about it at work.
[01:27:55.353 --> 01:27:58.796]  And I'm just a little disappointed in myself because I really could have talked to those people.
[01:27:58.816 --> 01:27:59.716]  They're getting a lot of facts wrong.
[01:27:59.736 --> 01:28:00.357]  Why didn't you though?
[01:28:00.397 --> 01:28:04.580]  Because you value your privacy and I know it's a hard thing to get out of that shell, but you better.
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:06.661]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:09.203]  I mean, I'm doing it on the message board, but it's just not enough anymore.
[01:28:10.126 --> 01:28:11.807]  I remember the first time I was about 20.
[01:28:13.188 --> 01:28:18.872]  The first time I went to a county commissioner meeting and got up in front of a room of about 150 people and gave a speech.
[01:28:20.032 --> 01:28:22.654]  And it's hard to do, but you've got to do it.
[01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:26.096]  And after you've been doing it long enough, it'll be like riding a bicycle, my friend.
[01:28:26.156 --> 01:28:27.317]  As easy as kiss my hand.
[01:28:27.817 --> 01:28:28.758]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:28:29.298 --> 01:28:30.379]  Yeah, real quick.
[01:28:30.459 --> 01:28:31.220]  Well, stay there.
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.021]  We'll come back to you and I'm going to get into the news.
[01:28:33.581 --> 01:28:34.402]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:34.502 --> 01:28:36.063]  It's the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:36.423 --> 01:28:39.445]  Infowars.net and presentplanet.tv are the websites.
[01:28:42.947 --> 01:28:45.909]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.929 --> 01:28:49.532]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.003 --> 01:28:59.144]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:28:59.364 --> 01:29:01.125]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:29:01.385 --> 01:29:07.667]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:07.967 --> 01:29:14.088]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.328 --> 01:29:16.169]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:29:16.449 --> 01:29:16.730]  I think?
[01:29:31.206 --> 01:29:34.747]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:29:34.927 --> 01:29:37.468]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:29:37.608 --> 01:29:38.688]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:38.948 --> 01:29:39.968]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:29:40.129 --> 01:29:42.809]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:42.829 --> 01:29:43.069]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:43.089 --> 01:29:43.169]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:47.571]  Thus says Yahweh, if you will not keep my commandments by violating my covenant, I will bring upon you sudden terror.
[01:30:03.186 --> 01:30:06.370]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:10.274]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[01:30:10.554 --> 01:30:18.503]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.
[01:30:18.883 --> 01:30:21.646]  Get to Witness Ministries' next shocking revelation.
[01:30:21.906 --> 01:30:25.130]  The Rider of the White Horse, George W. Bush in Prophecy.
[01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:28.272]  Visit the website, twowitnessministries.com.
[01:30:28.552 --> 01:30:32.956]  King George II beats the war drums for his next invasion, Iran and Syria.
[01:30:33.296 --> 01:30:36.358]  More nations are to follow, including the draft of your children.
[01:30:36.638 --> 01:30:45.545]  With a $25 love offering to Two Witness Ministries, get the book, The Rider of the White Horse, at Box 2453, Abilene, Texas, 79604.
[01:30:46.666 --> 01:30:50.649]  Unless she repents, America will not survive the Red Horse of World War III.
[01:30:52.563 --> 01:30:56.624]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:56.824 --> 01:31:00.246]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:31:00.406 --> 01:31:03.927]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:31:04.147 --> 01:31:07.348]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:07.368 --> 01:31:12.830]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[01:31:13.530 --> 01:31:14.170]  Yes, I think so.
[01:31:36.032 --> 01:31:40.494]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:31:40.574 --> 01:31:41.975]  That toll free number again?
[01:31:41.995 --> 01:31:42.055]  1-877-928-8822.
[01:31:42.075 --> 01:31:46.017]  Come you masters of war, here to build the big guns.
[01:32:04.421 --> 01:32:06.763]  Is it built of airplanes?
[01:32:08.745 --> 01:32:10.646]  Is it built of bombs?
[01:32:13.149 --> 01:32:15.531]  Is it hide behind walls?
[01:32:17.472 --> 01:32:19.294]  Is it hide behind desks?
[01:32:21.616 --> 01:32:25.799]  I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:34.524]  You that never done nothing but build to destroy.
[01:32:36.925 --> 01:32:43.109]  You play with my world like it's your little toy.
[01:32:45.371 --> 01:32:50.674]  You put a gun in my hand and you hide from
[01:32:54.239 --> 01:33:15.860]  You turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly Like Judas of old You lie and deceive A world war can be won You want me to believe
[01:33:22.404 --> 01:33:47.879]  And I see through your brain Like I see through the water that runs down my drain You fasten all the triggers For the others to fire And then you set back and watch
[01:33:49.904 --> 01:34:15.994]  When the death count gets higher You hide in your mansion While the young people's blood Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud He's thrown the worst fear That can ever be hurled
[01:34:18.662 --> 01:34:41.317]  Fair to bring children Into the world Oh, threatening my baby Unborn and unnamed You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins Welcome back!
[01:34:43.998 --> 01:34:45.980]  How much do I know
[01:34:47.159 --> 01:34:59.426]  This goes out to all the chicken hunks out there, all the people that love war, never been in it, and who think it's manly to go bomb a bunch of innocent people living in mud huts.
[01:35:00.726 --> 01:35:06.690]  Meanwhile, the very people running the war are the ones destroying the country.
[01:35:06.730 --> 01:35:06.990]  Literally.
[01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.270]  Alright.
[01:35:15.496 --> 01:35:20.538]  Before I get back into the news and then your calls, we're carrying a new film.
[01:35:20.618 --> 01:35:21.978]  It's Riddles in Stone.
[01:35:22.499 --> 01:35:24.959]  The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C.
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:28.201]  is the second volume in the Secret Mysteries series.
[01:35:28.841 --> 01:35:33.603]  Part two explores the highly controversial subject of the America's capital.
[01:35:34.783 --> 01:35:39.905]  Was the city built to reflect the majesty of American freedom or the hidden agenda of secret societies?
[01:35:40.962 --> 01:35:45.988]  With every major cornerstone laid by Freemasons was the city built in a Masonic pattern.
[01:35:46.348 --> 01:35:52.576]  Embark upon this incredible journey as Riddles interviews experts on both sides of the heated debate.
[01:35:53.957 --> 01:35:58.383]  Watch as Freemason apologists defend some of their most direct and hard-hitting questions
[01:36:00.959 --> 01:36:05.925]  Concerning the influence of masonry in America and its symbolism in Washington DC.
[01:36:05.985 --> 01:36:13.094]  Alongside them are leading researchers who maintain that a cult architecture permeates the city and conceals a secret agenda.
[01:36:15.597 --> 01:36:17.960]  It really is an extremely well done film.
[01:36:19.558 --> 01:36:25.000]  And it is $29.95, that's how much it retails for, that's how much they offer it for.
[01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:34.283]  You can get it for $24.95 or you can get it for even lower when you get it with my other films that cover similar genre, similar topics.
[01:36:35.404 --> 01:36:43.847]  But Riddles in Stone is very professionally produced, has a high budget, and is very well done and will really wake up a lot of people to all the bizarre, occult,
[01:36:44.517 --> 01:36:47.839]  Numerology and coding and symbols that are around us.
[01:36:48.759 --> 01:36:55.863]  It is, again, Part 2 of the Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings.
[01:36:56.663 --> 01:36:59.524]  And it is an absolute must-see.
[01:36:59.564 --> 01:37:01.605]  It is available at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:01.625 --> 01:37:03.326]  You can go there and watch the trailer.
[01:37:04.187 --> 01:37:08.969]  There's also a free DVD, but it's four films for one low price.
[01:37:10.956 --> 01:37:21.660]  For a limited time, you'll save 20% on the regular price when you purchase these powerful films together in this special DVD bundle.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:35.565]  You get The Order of Death, Dark Secrets, Inside Bohemian Grove DVD, my two classic films which expose the elites of cult practices and the secret cult of death which connects groups like the Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones.
[01:37:36.556 --> 01:37:44.999]  And that's the new film I made with the new footage inside Bohemian Grove, shot by an employee in 2005, with the first footage ever shot when I snuck in in 2000 with Mike Hanson.
[01:37:45.839 --> 01:37:52.781]  There's both those films, one's an hour and a half, one's about 46 minutes long, on one DVD.
[01:37:53.261 --> 01:38:01.704]  Then Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 1, and Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Riddles in Stone, Secret Architecture, Washington, D.C.
[01:38:05.467 --> 01:38:23.983]  comes together so you're getting four films for $59.95 and that's extremely discounted get them all together and get a big discount or get Riddles in Stone by itself again at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 888-253-3139 or just write to me I'm Alex Jones at 3001

[01:39:01.299 --> 01:39:02.781]  High quality copies of my films.
[01:39:02.841 --> 01:39:03.521]  Burn them to disk.
[01:39:03.541 --> 01:39:04.202]  Give them to people.
[01:39:04.602 --> 01:39:05.303]  Get the word out.
[01:39:05.323 --> 01:39:06.204]  15 cents a day.
[01:39:06.224 --> 01:39:10.287]  I want to thank all the members at PrisonPlanet.tv for your membership there.
[01:39:10.667 --> 01:39:12.088]  That makes so much of what we do possible.
[01:39:12.189 --> 01:39:16.932]  If you aren't a member, or you've let your membership elapse, a lot of new stuff up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:17.513 --> 01:39:21.336]  It'll be the 3 year anniversary just in about 8 days.
[01:39:23.698 --> 01:39:24.078]  Let me see.
[01:39:24.098 --> 01:39:26.320]  It was about April 4th.
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.302]  Yeah, so it's about 8 days when we launched that.
[01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:38.292]  So it will be about eight days, or maybe less, since we launched PrisonPlanet.tv three years ago.
[01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:41.134]  Thousands of pieces of media, great deal.
[01:39:41.194 --> 01:39:42.434]  We're making it better all the time.
[01:39:42.554 --> 01:39:45.736]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[01:39:46.576 --> 01:39:48.157]  We give so much out for free, folks.
[01:39:49.357 --> 01:39:51.418]  The message is where the passion is.
[01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:53.619]  The fight is where our souls are.
[01:39:53.879 --> 01:39:54.880]  It's where our centers are.
[01:39:55.806 --> 01:40:09.197]  And when you support us, when you get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, or you purchase my films, and you make copies of them, you support us to make more films, and to run our operations, and have the news sites, and the original stories, and everything we do.
[01:40:09.998 --> 01:40:23.509]  But also, you've got a film that you're authorized and encouraged to make copies of, or air on AXS TV, or show at the library, or the VFW Hall, you have something that's well produced, that has the truth, that can wake others up.
[01:40:23.982 --> 01:40:28.204]  And if you can't afford to buy the films, most of them are up on Google Video.
[01:40:28.364 --> 01:40:30.825]  They're in higher quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, obviously.
[01:40:30.865 --> 01:40:33.706]  Better for download and distribution in the info war.
[01:40:34.526 --> 01:40:35.626]  But you can just watch it there.
[01:40:35.726 --> 01:40:36.467]  Share that link.
[01:40:36.527 --> 01:40:36.987]  It's free.
[01:40:37.907 --> 01:40:39.328]  Share that link on Message Board.
[01:40:39.448 --> 01:40:40.748]  Share that link on MySpace.
[01:40:40.808 --> 01:40:43.509]  Share that link anywhere and everywhere you can.
[01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:49.672]  Create a dummy account with a proxy server if you don't want to send it to your friends and family in your email list.
[01:40:49.692 --> 01:40:50.432]  Send it to them that way.
[01:40:51.292 --> 01:40:53.074]  We cannot wait, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:53.294 --> 01:40:56.156]  You have to see yourself in the leadership capacity.
[01:40:56.536 --> 01:40:58.478]  You have to see yourself as the info warrior.
[01:40:58.818 --> 01:41:06.925]  You have to literally see yourself engaging the infrastructure, understanding the infrastructure first of the New World Order, and then taking it down.
[01:41:07.865 --> 01:41:10.828]  When you realize the infrastructure is in the mind, it's a lie.
[01:41:10.888 --> 01:41:11.488]  It's a fraud.
[01:41:11.528 --> 01:41:12.149]  It's a hoax.
[01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:15.191]  And you must engage each and every one of their lies.
[01:41:15.251 --> 01:41:16.633]  You must engage them now.
[01:41:17.273 --> 01:41:18.314]  This is so important.
[01:41:19.935 --> 01:41:20.296]  Okay.
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:30.141]  Let me just as quickly as I can run through the news, and then we'll go to your calls.
[01:41:34.182 --> 01:41:36.382]  Alright, Senator Hagel is running for President.
[01:41:36.983 --> 01:41:39.723]  He represents the branch of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:41:39.743 --> 01:41:46.625]  He's a frequent attendee that thinks the war is endangering their entire apple cart, and wants things to be more gradual.
[01:41:46.665 --> 01:41:47.485]  They're globalists.
[01:41:48.105 --> 01:41:51.526]  They're just not as aggressive, which really makes them more dangerous.
[01:41:53.058 --> 01:41:58.281]  So before you think he's some hero, hinting at impeachment the last few months, he's done this every few weeks.
[01:41:59.442 --> 01:42:03.924]  There are ways to deal with a president who says, I don't care about Congress, is what he said.
[01:42:03.944 --> 01:42:09.347]  But again, that's just one different faction of the power structure.
[01:42:11.008 --> 01:42:15.711]  I think Bush is one of the best things ever happened to this country.
[01:42:17.172 --> 01:42:19.533]  Now, I don't mean overall he's good, he's terrible.
[01:42:21.088 --> 01:42:26.289]  But he has shattered the left-right paradigm and woken up a lot of conservatives and liberals to that.
[01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:39.793]  And he has been so arrogant and so over-the-top and so stupid and just such a blithering idiot that he is... Because this thing's hereditary.
[01:42:40.273 --> 01:42:44.354]  They have really powerful think-tank experts and people who can craft the policies.
[01:42:45.094 --> 01:42:47.555]  But then they're flummoxed.
[01:42:47.615 --> 01:42:48.415]  They're screwed up.
[01:42:49.065 --> 01:42:56.673]  They're drugged to the mud by the idiot princelings that people this hierarchical apparatchik.
[01:42:57.974 --> 01:42:59.376]  So I'm done talking about Hegel.
[01:43:00.637 --> 01:43:03.340]  Stocks fall on housing data.
[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:04.621]  I'm not saying this is going to happen.
[01:43:04.902 --> 01:43:08.486]  They may keep pumping the bubble up for another 5-10 years for all I know.
[01:43:08.946 --> 01:43:10.568]  I just know when this bubble pops,
[01:43:12.032 --> 01:43:13.293]  It is going to be monumental.
[01:43:13.914 --> 01:43:31.347]  And the Financial Times of London, all the big globalist publications, IMF, World Bank documents that have come out, their own statements say, for like four years, we've been warning you, they want a gradual implosion of the dollar, a gradual drop in housing prices, a gradual slump, so that you don't panic and riot in the streets.
[01:43:33.726 --> 01:43:50.163]  Now, in third world countries where they can contain it, they want to have it all at once to have a riot, because then that drives the stocks and everything down even further, and the IMF World Bank private shareholders can come in and buy everything up cheap, and that's official IMF World Bank documents leaked over a thousand pages in 2002.
[01:43:52.085 --> 01:43:55.449]  So, sometimes they like that, but they're not ready for that yet here.
[01:43:56.084 --> 01:43:58.126]  We got 160 million gun owners.
[01:43:58.786 --> 01:44:00.267]  They know we're totally spoiled.
[01:44:00.808 --> 01:44:06.492]  They know that we're not like we were in 29 when they bankrupted us and told us to sit down and shut up and behave ourselves.
[01:44:06.532 --> 01:44:06.893]  We did.
[01:44:07.173 --> 01:44:09.134]  In a way, the decadence will backfire on them.
[01:44:09.174 --> 01:44:11.036]  I mean, it'll just be screaming and rioting.
[01:44:11.496 --> 01:44:13.098]  Women won't have their makeup or food.
[01:44:13.118 --> 01:44:14.939]  They'll just be running around, flipping out.
[01:44:15.359 --> 01:44:22.305]  Spoiled, pot-bellied, good old boys who know how to hang a lariat in the back of their truck but don't know how to actually ride a horse.
[01:44:22.745 --> 01:44:24.586]  They'll just be running around screaming.
[01:44:25.467 --> 01:44:29.949]  They'll be losing their Texas accents and shifting into their New London, Connecticut accents.
[01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:34.672]  I mean, it's going to be hell on earth, folks, if that does happen.
[01:44:35.032 --> 01:44:36.093]  And the New Order says that.
[01:44:36.133 --> 01:44:39.175]  They say we could just have a total global depression that could even endanger the elite.
[01:44:39.695 --> 01:44:41.336]  I mean, they say that in major newspapers.
[01:44:44.037 --> 01:44:45.058]  Like the Financial Times.
[01:44:46.018 --> 01:44:50.201]  I mean, you think you get them telling the truth there in the Wall Street Journal, you ought to read the Times.
[01:44:52.809 --> 01:45:03.399]  Continuing here, so my big thing is, if everybody knows who did this and people don't buy into all their solutions, then this can backfire on them.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:12.547]  And they're doing tests, they're doing marketing tests and questions and NSA spying, not to spy on you and see what you're going to do, but to spy on you and see what your mindset is.
[01:45:12.567 --> 01:45:13.088]  You understand?
[01:45:13.108 --> 01:45:16.751]  This is all how to manage you and what you're into.
[01:45:17.944 --> 01:45:19.545]  No one could look at the individual data.
[01:45:19.565 --> 01:45:36.138]  I mean, people like me get their individual data pulled and looked at by people, but anthropologists, sociologists, psychiatrists, you know, link men as they're called, idea men, but I'm digressing.
[01:45:36.198 --> 01:45:38.199]  Most people, you're just in graphs, folks.
[01:45:38.239 --> 01:45:43.883]  You're all aggregated into graphs, and they know what you want more than you want it.
[01:45:44.444 --> 01:45:46.205]  Sally Sockermom and Joe Sixpack.
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.261]  I mean, I don't want to get into it.
[01:45:49.401 --> 01:45:50.521]  It's just so feeble.
[01:45:51.641 --> 01:45:53.242]  Just look at these feebleness.
[01:45:53.442 --> 01:45:54.702]  Wanton feebleness.
[01:45:54.882 --> 01:45:55.882]  I just don't understand it.
[01:45:56.783 --> 01:46:00.924]  Oil prices hit 2007 highs on Iran tensions.
[01:46:03.605 --> 01:46:05.265]  And that's entirely speculative.
[01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:10.927]  They went into Iraq to use it as a beachhead to project power into the entire region, link up.
[01:46:11.647 --> 01:46:13.190]  We're good to go.
[01:46:25.078 --> 01:46:31.502]  World oil prices struck the highest point so far in 2007, nearing $64 a barrel.
[01:46:31.942 --> 01:46:39.128]  In London on Monday, as the market fretted over rising tensions in major crude producer Iran, traders said.
[01:46:39.548 --> 01:46:45.072]  In London, the price of Brent North Sea Crude May delivery rose $0.52 to $63.70 a barrel in economic details.
[01:46:50.347 --> 01:46:54.791]  It had earlier struck a $63.97, the highest point since December 6.
[01:46:54.851 --> 01:46:57.373]  So it's definitely trending back up now.
[01:46:58.854 --> 01:47:12.985]  The Iranian situation is adding a geopolitical risk premium to crude prices, with many market participants concerned that the nuclear situation could escalate, potentially leading to Iran using oil as a bargaining tool.
[01:47:13.909 --> 01:47:16.110]  Or blocking up the Persian Gulf, that's the main issue.
[01:47:16.570 --> 01:47:28.854]  And if that happens, if you average mainstream analysts, let's not go off the alternative analysts, who are probably more accurate, we're looking at $200 to $300 a barrel for Brent Crude.
[01:47:31.354 --> 01:47:38.397]  Now, folks, if that happens, you're going to be paying $8 to $10 a gallon.
[01:47:39.137 --> 01:47:42.778]  And if that happens, the economy will tank directly.
[01:47:43.371 --> 01:47:44.955]  And the dollar will tank directly.
[01:47:46.899 --> 01:47:48.522]  Further, I don't know how much more you can tank.
[01:47:49.062 --> 01:47:51.825]  I mean, folks, whoever thought it could go this far?
[01:47:52.165 --> 01:47:55.108]  But I guess the invincible ignorance of the public is actually helping us.
[01:47:55.168 --> 01:47:56.890]  I'm kind of, in a sick way, glad.
[01:47:56.930 --> 01:48:14.046]  I mean, literally, you look at these smiley-faced yuppies running around, posing, and again, they're not really, you see them, you know, it's just all a big act, and they all act real powerful and manly, and the women all, you know, act like they know everything, and they swoosh around, and you know what I'm talking about.
[01:48:16.387 --> 01:48:42.416]  And the reason I'm disgusted by it is it's like knowing a dam broke upstream five miles away, and then in a few minutes, you're going to be under 30 feet of water, and you're like running around telling people, hey man, this is serious, and by the way, this is who blew the dam, and they just look at you and go, sure, dams have never broken before, and then you go, okay, run in here, it's on the news, and they go, I'm not going to watch it, and you're just like,
[01:48:44.105 --> 01:48:47.326]  Because I am literally tied to you idiots.
[01:48:47.966 --> 01:48:48.806]  I don't mean my listeners.
[01:48:48.846 --> 01:48:49.967]  I mean the general public.
[01:48:49.987 --> 01:48:50.867]  You know who I'm talking about.
[01:48:51.167 --> 01:48:52.587]  We're all tied to these lemmings.
[01:48:52.827 --> 01:48:55.788]  We can't just step out of the way and let them run off the end of the cliff.
[01:48:56.829 --> 01:48:58.369]  Which I don't want to see anyways.
[01:48:58.809 --> 01:48:59.689]  And see the enemy win.
[01:49:00.009 --> 01:49:01.090]  We are tied to them.
[01:49:01.110 --> 01:49:03.010]  We are literally being drugged by them.
[01:49:03.570 --> 01:49:05.971]  Or a better analogy is like a stampede of buffalo.
[01:49:06.831 --> 01:49:09.172]  Or a stampede of elephants right off the end of a cliff.
[01:49:10.243 --> 01:49:12.766]  And we can avert this, folks.
[01:49:13.006 --> 01:49:14.788]  They're going to have national ID cards.
[01:49:14.828 --> 01:49:17.590]  You're going to have a national sales tax on top of income taxes.
[01:49:18.411 --> 01:49:19.873]  You're going to have your whole life run.
[01:49:19.893 --> 01:49:25.318]  You're going to monthly, just to kick this off, going to have CPS in your house interrogating all of you.
[01:49:25.958 --> 01:49:27.840]  You're going to live in a hellish system.
[01:49:29.762 --> 01:49:31.043]  And, of course, that's not going to work.
[01:49:31.083 --> 01:49:32.144]  They know it's going to get violent.
[01:49:32.164 --> 01:49:33.486]  They know it's going to turn into a shooting war.
[01:49:34.674 --> 01:49:37.758]  I don't want a bunch of dumb cops and military to be dead all over the streets.
[01:49:37.798 --> 01:49:39.259]  They know we're going to win the first wave.
[01:49:39.499 --> 01:49:40.961]  Then they're going to bring in foreign troops.
[01:49:42.282 --> 01:49:43.764]  And folks, it's going to happen.
[01:49:43.804 --> 01:49:44.925]  Do you understand that?
[01:49:44.945 --> 01:49:47.849]  Do you understand this is going to happen unless we turn it around?
[01:49:48.349 --> 01:49:49.610]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:49:50.291 --> 01:49:50.792]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:55.991 --> 01:49:56.472]  It's here!
[01:49:56.692 --> 01:50:01.437]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.837 --> 01:50:09.445]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:17.222]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.622 --> 01:50:29.044]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.345 --> 01:50:33.025]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.285 --> 01:50:35.246]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.566 --> 01:50:39.427]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:52.924 --> 01:50:53.705]  Terrorism!
[01:50:53.845 --> 01:50:54.605]  Terrorism!
[01:50:54.705 --> 01:51:00.769]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:51:01.029 --> 01:51:02.630]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:05.332]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:51:05.732 --> 01:51:20.301]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:51:20.341 --> 01:51:20.641]  government.
[01:51:20.841 --> 01:51:22.642]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:51:23.002 --> 01:51:28.927]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:51:29.047 --> 01:51:33.531]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[01:52:48.529 --> 01:52:51.171]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:52:57.643 --> 01:52:59.525]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:00.005 --> 01:53:02.828]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:03.829 --> 01:53:05.370]  That's right, that's what we're doing.
[01:53:05.410 --> 01:53:13.577]  Jerome Corsi joining us to expose the pedophile scandal raging in Texas with the Republican Party, as usual, running everything.
[01:53:13.597 --> 01:53:16.119]  It's unbelievable.
[01:53:16.139 --> 01:53:18.541]  And the Democrats are bad, involving a lot of bad stuff.
[01:53:18.561 --> 01:53:21.244]  But mainly it's, you know, full-grown female hookers.
[01:53:23.201 --> 01:53:24.082]  Which is bad enough.
[01:53:24.122 --> 01:53:26.963]  This is just... It never ends with these people.
[01:53:27.043 --> 01:53:27.723]  This is sick.
[01:53:32.685 --> 01:53:34.986]  Stocks fall on housing data.
[01:53:36.187 --> 01:53:46.612]  I mentioned that they fell sharply Monday after a surprise drop in new home sales for February triggered further concern that economic growth is slowing more than expected.
[01:53:46.632 --> 01:53:51.734]  The Dow Jones Industrials at times showed losses of more than a hundred points
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:54:15.709]  You already know oil prices have gone way up, and then IMF to urge depreciation of dollar, and the IMF has put out their report saying that they want an extraordinarily aggressive devaluation, and they want a stronger Chinese denomination and Japanese denomination.
[01:54:15.729 --> 01:54:23.492]  You can go read all the details of this on presentplanet.com and infowork.com if you want, but it says a stronger yin and yang.
[01:54:24.918 --> 01:54:28.442]  And stronger European currency, of course.
[01:54:29.163 --> 01:54:35.309]  They get us strung out, they get us doped up on their New World Order system, and then they just pull the rug right out from under us.
[01:54:36.130 --> 01:54:38.592]  You better believe these flag-waving people, man.
[01:54:38.612 --> 01:54:40.955]  They're going to appraise the people destroying the country.
[01:54:42.156 --> 01:54:43.958]  It's too much to have to watch it!
[01:54:45.525 --> 01:54:47.247]  I just keep getting mad at the public.
[01:54:47.307 --> 01:54:48.589]  I know the New World Order is evil.
[01:54:48.649 --> 01:54:49.530]  I know they're bad.
[01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:51.351]  I know they're out of control.
[01:54:51.392 --> 01:54:54.395]  But the population, how can you be so kind?
[01:54:54.955 --> 01:54:58.219]  They won't do it if they think you won't put up with it.
[01:54:58.639 --> 01:54:59.900]  If they know they're going to get the blame.
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:01.162]  You need to be calling the White House.
[01:55:02.617 --> 01:55:03.377]  Why haven't I done this?
[01:55:03.397 --> 01:55:08.858]  We need to be calling Congress, the White House, everybody, and calling your neighbors and letting them know, and just going, look, stupid!
[01:55:09.279 --> 01:55:12.859]  It's not what you hear on Sean Hannity and on the liberals in conservative shows.
[01:55:13.119 --> 01:55:14.980]  That's all fake, diversion news.
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:15.880]  Ninety percent of it.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:21.161]  The fact is, there's a world government that's destroying our sovereignty and our economy, and it's taking over.
[01:55:21.241 --> 01:55:22.081]  Please wake up!
[01:55:22.982 --> 01:55:25.662]  And call the White House and say, you stop blowing our dollar!
[01:55:26.042 --> 01:55:28.023]  And you stop setting up your New World Order.
[01:55:31.132 --> 01:55:32.655]  I just can't believe they're doing this to us.
[01:55:33.937 --> 01:55:35.719]  I'm actually grieving right now.
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:37.142]  I'm having trouble talking.
[01:55:38.384 --> 01:55:43.011]  I'm having trouble getting into actual news and information because I'm just so mad.
[01:55:45.795 --> 01:55:51.377]  The thing that I'm a softy, or I'm old-fashioned, or I'm dumb, you know, I love America and I love the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:55:51.717 --> 01:55:52.797]  Man, that's all I got!
[01:55:53.277 --> 01:55:54.318]  This is where we live!
[01:55:54.658 --> 01:55:56.938]  I mean, if you don't love the country, at least do it for your children!
[01:55:57.238 --> 01:55:58.139]  Where do you think they're gonna grow up?
[01:55:58.159 --> 01:55:59.319]  Where do you think they're gonna live?
[01:55:59.799 --> 01:56:01.880]  I look at my kids every day and I almost start crying!
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:03.920]  That's how bad it is!
[01:56:04.161 --> 01:56:05.261]  Do you understand me?
[01:56:06.141 --> 01:56:06.781]  It's bad!
[01:56:07.021 --> 01:56:07.502]  Okay?
[01:56:07.722 --> 01:56:08.562]  It's real bad!
[01:56:10.002 --> 01:56:12.223]  And it's getting worse and worse by the day!
[01:56:13.886 --> 01:56:20.951]  Oh man, people are watching MTV and running around drunk and on, I mean, I don't know, it's just incredible.
[01:56:21.752 --> 01:56:25.755]  But they couldn't have done it to us unless they got us completely mesmerized.
[01:56:27.636 --> 01:56:29.017]  And then I got stories like this.
[01:56:29.077 --> 01:56:34.401]  I mean, I could talk for hours about this and make all the connections and show you all the evidence and go through the facts.
[01:56:36.582 --> 01:56:38.524]  Drones could defend airports.
[01:56:38.724 --> 01:56:39.845]  Oh great, protect me.
[01:56:40.535 --> 01:56:59.845]  But then you realize that when these global criminals have almost the entire Air Force and the fleets under remote control, it allows very small groups of globalists to attack our own populations, to start wars, because then, you know, it doesn't matter if a soldier won't commit a crime, it won't matter if the cops won't do it, they'll just have their own robotic forces to do it!
[01:57:00.165 --> 01:57:03.246]  And believe me, most of this development is in robotic ground forces!
[01:57:03.566 --> 01:57:05.187]  And yeah, it's 2007, folks!
[01:57:05.227 --> 01:57:07.048]  We're in the future now, okay?
[01:57:07.568 --> 01:57:08.389]  USA Today!
[01:57:09.691 --> 01:57:19.502]  Homeland Security Department and the military this summer will test whether drones flying at 65,000 feet above the nation's busiest airports could be used to protect planes from being shot down.
[01:57:19.522 --> 01:57:23.466]  They're going to be used to spy on people, folks, by terrorists with shoulder-fire missiles.
[01:57:24.867 --> 01:57:28.051]  Dubbed Project Shoal, and it just goes into it.
[01:57:28.952 --> 01:57:29.913]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:32.802 --> 01:57:37.824]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.039 --> 01:57:53.261]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:53.882 --> 01:57:54.722]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.443 --> 01:57:56.343]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.363 --> 01:58:00.645]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.206 --> 01:58:05.328]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.989 --> 01:58:12.952]  Well, I live in the capital city of the great state of Texas, Austin, literally in the geographic center of the state.
[01:58:13.812 --> 01:58:15.873]  I am deep in the heart of Tejas,
[01:58:17.472 --> 01:58:19.153]  I'm a Texian, I guess you could call me.
[01:58:20.754 --> 01:58:25.277]  And, uh, this scandal has been raging for a year.
[01:58:26.798 --> 01:58:37.924]  The fact that a youth commission, all over the state, raping children, uh, selling them out for prostitution, it's much worse than what you hear on the national news, and I even know stuff that's on the inside.
[01:58:39.105 --> 01:58:40.186]  I mean, it's hell on earth.
[01:58:40.386 --> 01:58:41.326]  It's hell on earth here.
[01:58:41.746 --> 01:58:45.889]  And it's in the paper yesterday, excuse me, two days ago, on the front page of the Statesman,
[01:58:47.029 --> 01:58:53.793]  Where also 94% of the terms were extended or 93% they never let the young people out of juvenile.
[01:58:54.993 --> 01:59:00.756]  But it's also the CPS system with the small children, torturing them, raping them, abusing them.
[01:59:01.056 --> 01:59:02.297]  No investigations are done.
[01:59:02.357 --> 01:59:03.458]  No one is held accountable.
[01:59:04.758 --> 01:59:09.661]  Federal numbers, CPS workers are five times more likely to abuse children than any other group.
[01:59:10.794 --> 01:59:13.596]  I mean, it's well known that's where the smart pedophiles go.
[01:59:13.656 --> 01:59:19.561]  They go to be truancy officers, school teachers, school principals, but nowhere do you see higher numbers than in truancy officers.
[01:59:20.341 --> 01:59:22.703]  And this is basic criminology, by the way, folks.
[01:59:22.743 --> 01:59:25.686]  Go buy a few textbooks on it to know your enemy.
[01:59:26.166 --> 01:59:27.607]  And so they can get away with all this.
[01:59:27.647 --> 01:59:35.233]  Now, in the past, this wouldn't spread because, you know, higher up, at least the criminals running things knew to keep control of this or it would blow up into a scandal.
[01:59:36.084 --> 01:59:44.116]  Well, they can't really do that because, you know, you got Mark Foley up there running things and that pervert running the missing and exploited children operation.
[01:59:44.456 --> 01:59:48.042]  Well, we've had two different Deputy Directors of Homeland Security involved in pedophilia.
[01:59:48.683 --> 01:59:51.447]  Basically, this is how you join the club with these folks.
[01:59:52.365 --> 01:59:55.047]  And if they're not in on it, they're busy covering it up.
[01:59:55.388 --> 01:59:58.690]  Headline from WorldNetDaily also writes for Human Events.
[01:59:59.191 --> 02:00:00.592]  He's Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[02:00:00.652 --> 02:00:03.914]  He's an expert on the North American Union Security Prosperity Partnership.
[02:00:03.934 --> 02:00:08.138]  We're always honored that he contributes on short notice to this transmission.
[02:00:08.538 --> 02:00:11.821]  Embattled Attorney General now accused in sex scandal cover-up.
[02:00:12.581 --> 02:00:17.025]  Attorney General Gonzalez among officials who allegedly ignored abuse of minor boys.
[02:00:17.585 --> 02:00:20.087]  So he's getting in trouble over this petty stuff with U.S.
[02:00:20.147 --> 02:00:20.608]  Attorneys.
[02:00:22.195 --> 02:00:26.940]  The Democrats won't touch this stuff, as Barney Frank's involved in it too, the Congressman.
[02:00:28.142 --> 02:00:33.167]  He doesn't get in trouble for trying to set up Border Patrol agents to stop enforcement.
[02:00:33.287 --> 02:00:39.153]  He gets in trouble for all these things that don't matter, but this stuff does.
[02:00:39.173 --> 02:00:43.938]  It says, Attorney General Gonzales among officials who allegedly ignored abuse of minor boys.
[02:00:44.697 --> 02:00:49.479]  And joining us with a great seven-page article, a lot of research, is Jerome Corsi.
[02:00:49.699 --> 02:00:54.340]  Jerome, we've got about two minutes until we break, but in a nutshell, how did you nationally get onto this story?
[02:00:55.021 --> 02:00:56.921]  Well, Alex, pleasure to be with you.
[02:00:57.442 --> 02:00:58.262]  Thank you.
[02:00:58.322 --> 02:01:12.647]  I've been following, as you know, Johnny Sutton and the Attorney General Gonzalez and their prosecution of Ramos and Campeon, two Border Patrol agents that are in federal prison for having fired their weapons after a fleeing drug smuggler.
[02:01:13.573 --> 02:01:17.077]  And as I get deeper and deeper into it, more cases develop.
[02:01:17.157 --> 02:01:24.564]  I mean, the Gil Hernandez case, the deputy sheriff that fired after a van and speeding illegal aliens and tried to run him over.
[02:01:25.225 --> 02:01:33.873]  So, now we're clear that what's going on is a pattern of political prosecutions coming out of the Attorney General's office through the U.S.
[02:01:33.934 --> 02:01:35.315]  Attorneys, and the most recent
[02:01:35.951 --> 02:01:45.839]  Is this Texas Youth Commission case, all the statewide abuse of boys going on by the personnel who run the TCY facility.
[02:01:45.919 --> 02:01:46.619]  And it's a club!
[02:01:46.679 --> 02:01:48.361]  It's not just a few people, it's a club!
[02:01:48.601 --> 02:01:51.463]  Oh, it's a systematic club, there's no question about it.
[02:01:51.903 --> 02:01:57.448]  They hired people with felony records, they were recruited into the system, I'm convinced of it.
[02:01:58.348 --> 02:02:04.433]  This was a free-for-all sex party that was being run by the pedophiles who were running the Texas Youth Commission.
[02:02:05.043 --> 02:02:08.006]  And it was knowledgeably being done and covered up.
[02:02:08.546 --> 02:02:13.851]  So that when it got to Johnny Sutton's office and Attorney General Gonzalez, they both declined prosecution.
[02:02:14.031 --> 02:02:16.754]  Yeah, they're too busy prosecuting valiant Border Patrol agents.
[02:02:17.174 --> 02:02:17.695]  Exactly.
[02:02:18.195 --> 02:02:24.141]  They can't be bothered with a massive pedophile scheme throughout the Texas correctional institutional system.
[02:02:25.570 --> 02:02:26.251]  Unbelievable.
[02:02:26.291 --> 02:02:28.632]  He writes for World Net Daily and Human Events.
[02:02:28.652 --> 02:02:31.214]  We've got links to those sites up on Infowars.com.
[02:02:31.234 --> 02:02:32.535]  He's Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[02:02:33.135 --> 02:02:34.636]  He's also a best-selling author.
[02:02:34.716 --> 02:02:38.699]  We'll be right back with his inside scoop on this nightmare.
[02:02:47.799 --> 02:02:53.284]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:53.644 --> 02:03:01.271]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:01.986 --> 02:03:09.049]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:09.449 --> 02:03:20.894]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.174 --> 02:03:24.735]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.135 --> 02:03:27.056]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:27.396 --> 02:03:31.238]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:44.372 --> 02:03:49.474]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:49.534 --> 02:03:56.836]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:03:56.996 --> 02:04:07.599]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:12.361]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:12.641 --> 02:04:17.644]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[02:04:17.845 --> 02:04:20.786]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.007 --> 02:04:30.833]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:37.502]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:44.139 --> 02:04:46.740]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:53.022]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[02:04:53.162 --> 02:05:02.306]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.
[02:05:02.546 --> 02:05:03.766]  It's called SlenderFX.
[02:05:04.006 --> 02:05:11.749]  SlenderFX opens the door for a healthy metabolism, permanent weight loss, reduction of low thyroid symptoms, and considerably increased energy by helping
[02:05:11.749 --> 02:05:11.909]  I think.
[02:05:31.587 --> 02:05:35.589]  That's how it works a lot of times is you're doing one investigation on the prosecutor Johnny Sutton
[02:06:00.538 --> 02:06:17.967]  Going after innocent war patrol agents and you find yourself in a whole other galaxy of evil and systematic with the CPS and young children right up to teenagers running the info I have prostitution out of these facilities.
[02:06:18.847 --> 02:06:28.392]  He's written a detailed report embattled AG now accused in sex scandal cover-up Attorney General Gonzalez among officials who allegedly ignored abuse of minor boys.
[02:06:29.469 --> 02:06:33.070]  And this is big news in Texas, but they're doing their best job they can to whitewash it.
[02:06:33.490 --> 02:06:35.831]  Dr. Corsi, writing for Roland Daily and Human Events.
[02:06:36.391 --> 02:06:39.612]  Again, we have links up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com to this story.
[02:06:40.172 --> 02:06:46.234]  Break down for us exactly how, you know, in your research, exactly how bad this is.
[02:06:46.294 --> 02:06:52.056]  You said a pedophile club, you know, have to be a felon basically to even join the club.
[02:06:52.637 --> 02:06:54.857]  And it's the same thing in Florida, by the way, folks.
[02:06:56.058 --> 02:06:56.918]  Break this down for us.
[02:06:57.458 --> 02:07:01.320]  Well Alex, let's make sure everybody listening understands exactly what we're talking about.
[02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:12.505]  We're talking about, first started in a Texas Youth Commission Correctional Facility in Paiote, West Texas.
[02:07:12.565 --> 02:07:14.766]  It's way out in West Texas by Odessa.
[02:07:15.767 --> 02:07:24.891]  And this facility, the two top people at it were both known felons or criminals or had sexual
[02:07:25.515 --> 02:07:27.055]  misconduct in their backgrounds.
[02:07:27.176 --> 02:07:34.298]  One of the two of them even used to like to look at nude pictures of men and women on his state computer at the facility.
[02:07:35.258 --> 02:07:46.001]  They organized to rouse the children out of their beds, and the inmates in this facility are boys aged 10 to 19, and have all-night sex parties with them.
[02:07:47.021 --> 02:07:50.122]  And then what they would do is, of course, threaten the boys.
[02:07:50.142 --> 02:07:52.783]  They extend the terms of the boys.
[02:07:53.408 --> 02:07:58.190]  Either to punish them for not participating, or maybe because they liked them and wanted to keep them around.
[02:07:58.210 --> 02:08:04.473]  Well, the front of the Statesman on Saturday reported 93% had their sentences extended.
[02:08:04.493 --> 02:08:08.935]  Now let's be clear, in Texas under this web of evil, because they built all these prisons everywhere,
[02:08:09.755 --> 02:08:13.939]  They have judges who have huge facilities with their name on it when they're still in office.
[02:08:13.959 --> 02:08:15.420]  They're like gods around here.
[02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:19.884]  Literal demigods ruling and worshipped by the people that feed this system.
[02:08:20.585 --> 02:08:27.290]  And what they do is, you get sent to juvie now in this state for the most petty of offenses.
[02:08:27.330 --> 02:08:27.951]  Please continue.
[02:08:28.551 --> 02:08:37.479]  Well, and so, these two people, these two administrators were running this facility and running basically a sex club out of it to their own benefit.
[02:08:38.457 --> 02:08:46.982]  And anyone they would hire, and it went throughout the system it turns out, because this is just not located at one facility in Pio, Texas.
[02:08:47.022 --> 02:08:59.650]  But I'm being told by the governor's office today and by the spokesperson brought into the Texas Youth Commission in order to help communicate how they're trying to solve this problem, which is going to be horrendous.
[02:09:00.291 --> 02:09:02.692]  That's called Special Master.
[02:09:03.292 --> 02:09:04.172]  Special Master.
[02:09:04.953 --> 02:09:06.373]  Oh, the Special Master.
[02:09:06.613 --> 02:09:06.893]  It is.
[02:09:06.953 --> 02:09:08.414]  It's a good, odd term, isn't it, Alex?
[02:09:08.734 --> 02:09:12.395]  Well, at any rate, this is an entire system-wide problem.
[02:09:12.415 --> 02:09:21.178]  There's over, right now, after they started investigating, and they really only started investigating this at the end of February, so they're less than a month into the investigation.
[02:09:21.198 --> 02:09:22.518]  Thousands of cases.
[02:09:22.798 --> 02:09:23.678]  Thousands of cases.
[02:09:23.698 --> 02:09:26.299]  They've got 1,200 files that have been opened.
[02:09:26.819 --> 02:09:28.460]  They've already made three arrests.
[02:09:28.988 --> 02:09:36.254]  There are dozens statewide of the correctional facility administrators, guards, and other personnel.
[02:09:36.274 --> 02:09:42.159]  I'm going to tell you right now, folks, as bad as this sounds, it's far worse with the CPFs and those holding facilities.
[02:09:42.619 --> 02:09:47.063]  Well, and they're saying that the staff involved is at the highest to the lowest levels.
[02:09:47.583 --> 02:09:52.647]  Basically sounds like you wouldn't get hired in one of these facilities unless you were a pedophile.
[02:09:52.887 --> 02:09:55.369]  Jerome, Dr. Corsi... Keep quiet about it.
[02:09:55.389 --> 02:09:57.071]  Dr. Corsi, sorry to interrupt, but I have to add this.
[02:09:57.231 --> 02:10:01.774]  Remember the scandal three or four years ago in Florida with the 3,000 missing kids grabbed by CPS?
[02:10:01.794 --> 02:10:02.815]  Yes, I do remember that.
[02:10:02.835 --> 02:10:05.157]  And the top three guys were child rapists running it?
[02:10:05.577 --> 02:10:07.058]  Yes, I remember that very well.
[02:10:07.078 --> 02:10:08.479]  Now I'm going to shut up and go back.
[02:10:08.499 --> 02:10:09.480]  Please restate what you said.
[02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:15.545]  Well, what I'm saying here is that you've got a culture of pedophilia that is at the core
[02:10:16.181 --> 02:10:17.622]  The Texas Youth Commission.
[02:10:18.263 --> 02:10:31.334]  And what that means is you won't get hired or you won't stay as an employee of the Texas Youth Commission unless you're willing to participate in the boy rape that's going on or keep quiet about it.
[02:10:32.175 --> 02:10:33.316]  And that's the whole deal.
[02:10:33.376 --> 02:10:41.043]  It becomes a culture in which all the inmates know, all the employees know, that it's the whole purpose of this
[02:10:41.733 --> 02:10:49.055]  of these facilities functioning is for sodomy and other sexual abuse of the minor boys who are the inmates.
[02:10:49.215 --> 02:10:58.517]  Now have you come across the intel, because I have somebody working in this office who knows a guard who quit, and this was years ago, because they were prostituting the children out.
[02:10:58.917 --> 02:11:03.358]  Well you know, Alex, if you could get to me any concrete information on that,
[02:11:03.889 --> 02:11:05.110]  I'm now in touch as of today.
[02:11:05.130 --> 02:11:06.832]  Yeah, but these people are all scared, Kev.
[02:11:06.872 --> 02:11:09.034]  Well, just get me anything they can go on.
[02:11:09.114 --> 02:11:10.034]  Get me an email.
[02:11:10.074 --> 02:11:15.039]  Okay, well, I'll... You point me in the right direction, I'll get the investigators pointed at it.
[02:11:15.419 --> 02:11:19.022]  Because I've been talking to them all day long since I wrote this article yesterday.
[02:11:19.082 --> 02:11:24.667]  I've been interviewing all the spokesmen for the Texas Youth Commission and the Governor's Office.
[02:11:25.296 --> 02:11:26.996]  I've got, you know, now several hours.
[02:11:27.056 --> 02:11:36.098]  I mean, it's just well known in Texas that a large portion of your state workers that work at these places and the CPS are a giant pedophile ring.
[02:11:36.358 --> 02:11:37.938]  I mean, that's always been known.
[02:11:37.958 --> 02:11:39.819]  And Alex, when you think about it, think about it.
[02:11:39.939 --> 02:11:44.800]  Here you get a boy who's put into one of these facilities, so they're incarcerated.
[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:46.700]  They call it a school, but you're in prison.
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:50.721]  And they learn that a bunch of buckets of maggot pus run things.
[02:11:52.605 --> 02:12:07.935]  You're either going to participate, you know, if you talk about it, one of these kids, 10 years old, that's the first age they're put in these facilities, up to 19, if you talk about it, if you tell your parents or you tell authorities, you're not going to be believed, you're going to be punished.
[02:12:08.755 --> 02:12:11.657]  It's the kind of thing you can't speak about, and you can't escape.
[02:12:12.282 --> 02:12:23.484]  Now, remember two years ago, tens of thousands of names of pedophiles the police got, but then it turned out that the large portion of them was police and judges, so it got shut down.
[02:12:23.504 --> 02:12:23.964]  Remember that?
[02:12:24.204 --> 02:12:24.844]  Yes, I do.
[02:12:24.944 --> 02:12:27.065]  Folks, we're dead meat.
[02:12:27.085 --> 02:12:27.885]  The country's gone.
[02:12:27.905 --> 02:12:30.205]  Jerome, I don't even know why we're even talking about it now.
[02:12:30.225 --> 02:12:31.546]  I mean, Satan runs things.
[02:12:31.966 --> 02:12:33.846]  We're now living in fruitcake land.
[02:12:34.246 --> 02:12:38.967]  Well, you know, you've got a Texas Ranger in this thing, a guy named Brian Brzezinski.
[02:12:39.711 --> 02:12:47.437]  And he is out there in West Texas and somebody comes into his office or calls him and complains about the sexual abuse going on.
[02:12:47.977 --> 02:12:49.058]  And he investigates it.
[02:12:49.598 --> 02:12:50.679]  He creates a file.
[02:12:50.719 --> 02:12:54.181]  He opens his file on February 23rd, I think it is, 2005.
[02:12:54.742 --> 02:13:01.807]  And he then undertakes a campaign to get anybody to listen to him to try to prosecute this.
[02:13:02.327 --> 02:13:06.970]  He goes to the Ward County DA, a guy named Randall Reynolds.
[02:13:08.567 --> 02:13:09.427]  He doesn't want to do it.
[02:13:09.467 --> 02:13:11.328]  He says there's nothing involved here.
[02:13:12.188 --> 02:13:21.511]  Over a two-year period of time, Brzezinski, this Texas Ranger, takes the case to Greg Abbott, the Attorney General of the state of Texas.
[02:13:21.551 --> 02:13:23.031]  Greg Abbott doesn't do anything.
[02:13:23.631 --> 02:13:25.812]  He takes it to Johnny Sutton, the U.S.
[02:13:25.872 --> 02:13:28.673]  Attorney in El Paso.
[02:13:28.693 --> 02:13:30.433]  Johnny Sutton doesn't do anything.
[02:13:30.973 --> 02:13:33.654]  Johnny Sutton's office writes a stupid letter
[02:13:34.221 --> 02:13:40.103]  It says that there's no civil rights violation unless the boy feels pain, basically.
[02:13:40.423 --> 02:13:42.864]  Oh, so it doesn't even deny the raping's going on?
[02:13:42.884 --> 02:13:44.344]  No, it does not deny that it's going on.
[02:13:44.404 --> 02:13:46.385]  Hell, they might as well just institutionalize it.
[02:13:46.405 --> 02:13:47.945]  It just says, I don't have enough here.
[02:13:47.965 --> 02:13:50.326]  It says not enough evidence to do anything.
[02:13:50.366 --> 02:13:52.427]  I can't prove that these boys felt pain.
[02:13:52.987 --> 02:13:56.668]  So I will just have maybe a one-year sentence that I can go after.
[02:13:57.008 --> 02:13:57.669]  I decline.
[02:13:58.289 --> 02:14:00.429]  And then it goes to Attorney General Gonzalez.
[02:14:00.449 --> 02:14:02.090]  It goes to the Civil Rights Division.
[02:14:02.896 --> 02:14:03.436]  Of the U.S.
[02:14:03.476 --> 02:14:06.018]  Justice Department, and they declined prosecution.
[02:14:06.078 --> 02:14:09.560]  And notice, this is a guy that writes memos saying children can be tortured.
[02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:11.221]  That's right.
[02:14:11.242 --> 02:14:28.813]  Well, this is... Now, here you've got this Texas Ranger Brzezinski running this campaign, and finally, I'm convinced he finally just leaked the report to the Dallas newspapers, and a few of the newspapers in Texas covered this in February, and it started blowing up.
[02:14:29.677 --> 02:14:30.518]  I got a hold of it.
[02:14:30.558 --> 02:14:32.939]  I got a hold of it last Thursday and Friday.
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:37.102]  And of course we put it up now as the lead article on World Med Daily.
[02:14:37.582 --> 02:14:38.883]  So it's up nationwide.
[02:14:39.444 --> 02:14:42.506]  And this lid has been blown on this case totally as a result.
[02:14:43.186 --> 02:14:53.313]  I watched the videotape of a Texas Senate hearing in which Brzezinski detailed how for two years no prosecutor in Texas would listen to him.
[02:14:53.753 --> 02:14:54.914]  They didn't want to touch the case.
[02:14:55.942 --> 02:14:59.609]  And that shows that they know it's systemic throughout the system.
[02:14:59.809 --> 02:15:06.441]  Yes, and also, even if you look at Sutton's letter, or the criminal justice letter, they all acknowledge it's going on.
[02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:08.391]  They all say it's going on.
[02:15:08.411 --> 02:15:09.992]  They say, we don't want to prosecute.
[02:15:10.372 --> 02:15:12.113]  But they do not say that... Well, you know what?
[02:15:12.253 --> 02:15:13.474]  I don't even want to cover it.
[02:15:13.514 --> 02:15:14.275]  It's disgusting.
[02:15:14.315 --> 02:15:15.415]  It makes your stomach turn.
[02:15:15.455 --> 02:15:17.557]  But you've got to, or this is going to continue.
[02:15:17.577 --> 02:15:18.757]  You've got to cover it.
[02:15:18.818 --> 02:15:19.638]  You've got to cover it.
[02:15:19.658 --> 02:15:20.579]  We've got to cover it.
[02:15:20.619 --> 02:15:33.287]  And then, you know, what this says is, you put this to Johnny Sutton's office, an attorney, General Gonzalez, and it puts a new light and dimension on the fact that political prosecutions are what are coming out of the Justice Department right now.
[02:15:34.068 --> 02:15:47.716]  Because Johnny Sutton is the same guy who, when the Mexican consulate writes a letter, goes and prosecutes Ramos and Campeon, two border patrol agents, for violating the civil rights of a fleeing drug smuggler.
[02:15:47.736 --> 02:15:56.342]  Well, don't forget, Gonzales is a former Enron lawyer and on one of the big state courts, so he's a big boy here in Texas.
[02:15:56.382 --> 02:15:57.262]  He knows all about it.
[02:15:57.862 --> 02:16:00.164]  Well, and also then they go prosecute
[02:16:00.700 --> 02:16:10.024]  You know, Gil Hernandez at Rock Springs, Texas, the deputy sheriff, he fired after a van of fleeing illegal aliens who were trying to run him over.
[02:16:10.044 --> 02:16:24.970]  Now, Gonzales is in federal prison, and of course, the illegal alien who was in that van, one of the women who got shot in the cheek from a ricocheting bullet or a fragment, she now has an attorney and she's going to sue
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:35.706]  You know, when a citizen runs and the police shoot at him, it's no big deal, but then when it's a precious illegal alien, it's like a three alarm fire.
[02:16:40.404 --> 02:16:47.169]  He can and does take on himself to file a civil rights violation case against law enforcement authorities.
[02:16:47.189 --> 02:16:53.234]  But we've got 10 year old boys getting raped by demons and they just say, well, maybe they like it, you know.
[02:16:53.814 --> 02:17:02.141]  In fact, Johnny Sutton's letter basically said, maybe the kids here have consented and we can't prove that they were really hurt.
[02:17:02.441 --> 02:17:05.463]  Oh yeah, when you're a prisoner, maybe they're consenting.
[02:17:05.643 --> 02:17:07.044]  Maybe it'll just be the new thing.
[02:17:07.324 --> 02:17:09.166]  When you go to prison, listen folks,
[02:17:10.271 --> 02:17:12.272]  I've been in juvenile, okay?
[02:17:12.792 --> 02:17:21.376]  One time I was sent to Terrell when I got in a fist fight and the guy went to the hospital and I had to go to court because when somebody goes to the hospital in a coma, you go to jail.
[02:17:22.096 --> 02:17:32.041]  And I was in juvenile one time and had the jail guards tell me he wanted to have sex with me and I told him, I said, my dad will kill you.
[02:17:32.341 --> 02:17:33.121]  You are dead.
[02:17:33.682 --> 02:17:36.283]  And he just closed the door and went on down the hall to rape somebody else.
[02:17:36.763 --> 02:17:37.463]  And he knew it, too.
[02:17:37.823 --> 02:17:38.884]  I told him, you will die.
[02:17:39.726 --> 02:17:41.593]  Alright, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:41.894 --> 02:17:42.356]  Stay with us.
[02:17:44.597 --> 02:17:52.860]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:57.461]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:17:57.762 --> 02:18:06.685]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[02:18:06.885 --> 02:18:10.506]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[02:18:10.806 --> 02:18:15.831]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:18:16.132 --> 02:18:22.858]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:18:23.339 --> 02:18:23.880]  What about you?
[02:18:24.642 --> 02:18:29.985]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:18:30.045 --> 02:18:31.065]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:18:31.205 --> 02:18:33.186]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:18:33.206 --> 02:18:35.727]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[02:18:35.747 --> 02:18:36.708]  The real money folks.
[02:18:52.944 --> 02:18:54.865]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[02:18:55.365 --> 02:18:56.346]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:18:56.426 --> 02:18:57.626]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[02:18:57.847 --> 02:18:58.287]  A 5% increase.
[02:18:58.887 --> 02:19:00.568]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the Euro.
[02:19:00.588 --> 02:19:02.990]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[02:19:03.010 --> 02:19:04.331]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[02:19:04.371 --> 02:19:05.231]  A 16% increase in real money.
[02:19:20.444 --> 02:19:23.466]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[02:19:24.027 --> 02:19:31.013]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:31.753 --> 02:19:34.395]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[02:19:35.096 --> 02:19:38.018]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[02:19:38.479 --> 02:19:39.880]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:46.881]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:47.421 --> 02:19:57.104]  Did you know that in 1975, 32 senators and 92 representatives signed the Declaration of Interdependence, which stated that we must bring about a new world order?
[02:19:57.404 --> 02:20:01.766]  It called for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.
[02:20:01.846 --> 02:20:07.168]  It called for the redistribution of the wealth from America to third and fourth world countries.
[02:20:07.989 --> 02:20:16.547]  This is the same New World Order call for by former President George Herbert Walter Bush 210 times at the start of the Iraqi War 1990-1991.
[02:20:19.202 --> 02:20:26.947]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:20:27.227 --> 02:20:29.048]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:29.068 --> 02:20:29.429]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:29.449 --> 02:20:29.909]  Call now.
[02:20:29.929 --> 02:20:32.571]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:44.478 --> 02:20:50.443]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:20:59.206 --> 02:20:59.746]  We're good.
[02:21:17.059 --> 02:21:18.080]  We're good to go.
[02:21:47.543 --> 02:21:51.546]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:51.606 --> 02:21:57.771]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is our guest.
[02:21:57.851 --> 02:21:59.512]  Look at this!
[02:22:14.272 --> 02:22:15.332]  This is a letter here.
[02:22:15.512 --> 02:22:22.014]  I would speculate that the political powers in Texas and Washington and the Republican Party were not interested in the sex scandal coming to light.
[02:22:22.074 --> 02:22:31.516]  Sutton and Gonzales let their political responsibilities outstrip their legal responsibilities and as a result you had children who were in danger of sexual abuse and were left in that danger.
[02:22:31.956 --> 02:22:43.159]  Well, it's like Dinecore and Halliburton was in the Chicago Tribune, two different reports, running giant child and female kidnapping rings and slave camps
[02:22:43.809 --> 02:22:51.577]  Where they also use them just, it was from sex slavery right down to sweatshops, I mean actual slaves folks, out of Europe and the Middle East.
[02:22:52.444 --> 02:22:53.385]  And nothing's going to be done.
[02:22:54.505 --> 02:23:00.169]  This really is the ruling elite's modus operandi, the tie that binds.
[02:23:01.690 --> 02:23:05.132]  Dr. Corsi burrowing into this nest of these people.
[02:23:05.452 --> 02:23:07.634]  Do you think it's just going to keep unraveling and coming out?
[02:23:07.654 --> 02:23:10.996]  Because frankly, I don't see Rick Perry from his past activities.
[02:23:11.396 --> 02:23:12.737]  I see him whitewashing this.
[02:23:12.797 --> 02:23:16.119]  I mean, they're already going after these jail guards and people.
[02:23:17.319 --> 02:23:24.303]  For things like criminally extending sentences and hiring felons, they're not going after him for the really hardcore stuff.
[02:23:25.023 --> 02:23:30.706]  Well, I think with us bringing national attention to it, Alex, it's going to be a lot harder to bury this in Texas.
[02:23:31.427 --> 02:23:36.129]  And with the whole scandal over the firing of eight U.S.
[02:23:36.189 --> 02:23:39.831]  attorneys by Gonzales and the congressional investigation that's ongoing,
[02:23:40.541 --> 02:23:44.264]  And also the investigation that's ongoing into Johnny Sutton's role, the U.S.
[02:23:44.324 --> 02:23:52.690]  prosecutor in El Paso, in prosecuting the Border Patrol agents Ramos and Campeon for shooting after a fleeing Mexican drug smuggler.
[02:23:53.231 --> 02:23:56.933]  There's plenty of investigations into which this story fits as context.
[02:23:57.514 --> 02:23:59.035]  And I think it'll have to be pursued.
[02:23:59.055 --> 02:24:07.041]  I mean, if you've got guards and, you know, every level of staff involved in a pedophile scheme,
[02:24:07.699 --> 02:24:12.101]  Within the Texas Youth Commission facilities throughout the state.
[02:24:12.842 --> 02:24:17.024]  And it's going to involve dozens of criminal complaints and cases.
[02:24:17.044 --> 02:24:18.805]  They should all be released right now!
[02:24:18.865 --> 02:24:24.488]  Whatever crimes they're... I mean, if they're non-violent, these kids should be out of there now, because we know the crime's ongoing.
[02:24:24.908 --> 02:24:34.433]  Well, and the cases that ought to come out of this... You know, you've got two years of time in which Brzezinski, this Texas Ranger, was pressing.
[02:24:34.473 --> 02:24:35.554]  He had the investigation.
[02:24:36.075 --> 02:24:37.676]  Pressing somebody to get prosecuted.
[02:24:37.696 --> 02:24:43.599]  Now that's two years of abuse in these facilities throughout the state of Texas.
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:46.381]  The children suffered, but they didn't have to suffer.
[02:24:47.125 --> 02:24:49.647]  And I would think that that would lead to some excellent lawsuits.
[02:24:49.667 --> 02:25:02.579]  That makes, criminally not just civilly, I mean that clearly meets the standard of being complicit after the fact and really fostering all this happening.
[02:25:02.599 --> 02:25:07.343]  Alberto Gonzalez and Johnny Sutton, they need to be indicted for covering this up.
[02:25:07.563 --> 02:25:10.966]  Well that's right because you see it's not just the instance now where we can prove
[02:25:11.644 --> 02:25:23.595]  That there was instances of child abuse going on at these facilities, but there was a conspiracy to commit sodomy and other sexual acts with minor children in these facilities.
[02:25:24.115 --> 02:25:38.668]  Now, if that information came to Johnny Sutton and to Alberto Gonzalez, and we know it did, because we have the letters in which both the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice and Johnny Sutton's office, Bill Ballman, the same
[02:25:39.514 --> 02:25:40.375]  Assistant U.S.
[02:25:40.655 --> 02:25:48.684]  Attorney who prosecuted the Gil Hernandez case, they wrote a declined prosecution which made it clear they knew that there was an investigation that was conducted.
[02:25:49.204 --> 02:25:58.494]  Now that investigation turns out to have been that they should have known it was a conspiracy to commit these acts and yet they didn't prosecute or investigate.
[02:25:59.134 --> 02:26:00.616]  I think the burden of proof on
[02:26:01.374 --> 02:26:08.159]  Sutton and Gonzalez is going to increase dramatically as to why they were negligent in their duties.
[02:26:08.199 --> 02:26:13.602]  Were they criminally negligent in their duties to investigate when they had information these offenses were occurring?
[02:26:13.783 --> 02:26:20.427]  Well, they're also criminally negligent with all these Mexican troop incursions and shooting and killing Border Patrol and Sheriff's deputies.
[02:26:21.148 --> 02:26:23.990]  I mean, these guys are just absolute crooks.
[02:26:24.330 --> 02:26:28.693]  Right, well, and the way I think that they're going to take a fall on this, Alex, is
[02:26:29.284 --> 02:26:52.383]  You know, the kind of ways I've been taught, and I've always done investigations, I remember back in the McClellan Committee days, when the proof that the Teamsters were being penetrated by gangsters got down to their hotel bills, and, you know, the room, you know, looking to see their laundry was being paid for through the rooms they were holding in the hotels, not by the union, but by the mobsters.
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:57.262]  You could say to this guy, if you're a union official, why does this mobster over here pay your hotel bill?
[02:26:57.282 --> 02:26:58.342]  Well, here's another example.
[02:26:58.422 --> 02:27:01.784]  I talked to somebody who I know very well, a very truthful person.
[02:27:02.284 --> 02:27:14.530]  They mentioned to me, back in the late 80's, being at a huge Mexican Mafia meeting, where La Raza met you, and Gonzalez was one of the key people there, in his suit, the whole nine yards.
[02:27:15.522 --> 02:27:18.164]  I mean, you know, this guy is just something else.
[02:27:18.184 --> 02:27:22.246]  Well, here's the hard evidence you've got here that's like the hotel bill.
[02:27:22.286 --> 02:27:22.846]  Well, stay there.
[02:27:23.206 --> 02:27:23.727]  We're going to break.
[02:27:23.747 --> 02:27:29.570]  Let's do five more minutes on the other side, sir, and I'll let you get back to your important work, and I'm going to cover international news and take more calls.
[02:27:29.950 --> 02:27:31.331]  Dr. Jerome Coors, he's our guest.
[02:27:31.391 --> 02:27:32.192]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:27:34.893 --> 02:27:35.834]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.274 --> 02:27:37.875]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.895 --> 02:27:41.477]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.583 --> 02:27:47.925]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:27:48.165 --> 02:27:50.207]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:27:50.347 --> 02:27:57.453]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:27:57.673 --> 02:28:06.200]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[02:28:47.304 --> 02:28:49.405]  Does this sound bring on a sudden onset of fear?
[02:28:49.865 --> 02:28:51.765]  A fear of not knowing who's on the other end?
[02:28:52.065 --> 02:28:56.526]  Do you avoid picking up the phone knowing it's just going to be another harassing phone call from a debt collector?
[02:28:56.666 --> 02:29:01.128]  Do you resent your daily trips to the mailbox knowing it will be flooded with notices from creditors?
[02:29:01.448 --> 02:29:04.388]  Over 1 million credit card holders will declare bankruptcy this year.
[02:29:04.628 --> 02:29:06.989]  Learn how to legally eliminate your credit card debt.
[02:29:07.149 --> 02:29:07.729]  Want to know more?

[02:29:08.349 --> 02:29:08.629]  That's 920-293-8024.
[02:29:16.027 --> 02:29:18.508]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:29:18.988 --> 02:29:20.888]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:29:21.609 --> 02:29:24.790]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:29:25.430 --> 02:29:31.892]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[02:29:32.672 --> 02:29:34.873]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[02:29:35.253 --> 02:29:35.693]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:29:35.773 --> 02:29:37.173]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:29:46.138 --> 02:29:49.921]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[02:29:50.301 --> 02:29:57.625]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[02:29:58.066 --> 02:30:09.013]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:30:09.093 --> 02:30:09.533]  Central.
[02:30:09.893 --> 02:30:15.497]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[02:30:15.837 --> 02:30:21.739]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:30:22.219 --> 02:30:26.961]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[02:30:27.341 --> 02:30:32.143]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[02:30:32.583 --> 02:30:33.884]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[02:30:33.944 --> 02:30:34.364]  Central.
[02:30:34.944 --> 02:30:42.347]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[02:30:53.806 --> 02:30:56.608]  It's scary to admit that criminals are running the government.
[02:30:56.628 --> 02:30:57.348]  Both parties.
[02:30:57.908 --> 02:30:59.749]  Most states are completely criminal run.
[02:31:00.630 --> 02:31:04.492]  They're involved in weapons dealing, drug dealing, child porn.
[02:31:05.432 --> 02:31:06.273]  Because they're evil.
[02:31:06.333 --> 02:31:07.333]  They don't have a conscience.
[02:31:07.373 --> 02:31:08.834]  They enjoy all the things they do.
[02:31:09.314 --> 02:31:10.575]  And they hire their own people.
[02:31:10.595 --> 02:31:11.575]  And that's what tyranny is.
[02:31:12.136 --> 02:31:14.277]  Once you get corrupt people in government, it just accelerates.
[02:31:15.417 --> 02:31:17.018]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is our guest.
[02:31:17.078 --> 02:31:18.039]  I know we have loaded phone lines.
[02:31:18.059 --> 02:31:18.739]  I'm going to get to you.
[02:31:19.649 --> 02:31:22.271]  Dr. Boylang and Dan, you were talking about smoking gun evidence.
[02:31:22.291 --> 02:31:26.253]  Yeah, your seven-page report of the World Lent Daily is absolutely amazing.
[02:31:26.293 --> 02:31:31.136]  We're linked to it up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for folks who want to go link through there.
[02:31:31.917 --> 02:31:37.921]  Please, just any other key areas in your investigation that need to be hit on and give us any other
[02:31:39.355 --> 02:31:42.998]  Kind of a heads up on what new revelations may be coming out next.
[02:31:43.698 --> 02:31:48.461]  I think, Alex, the next things are going to be to track this report that the Texas Ranger did.
[02:31:48.481 --> 02:32:05.013]  He developed this report in February 2005, and to track the timeline through which he was rejected prosecution by the district attorney in the county where it occurred, by the state, Greg Abbott, by the federal
[02:32:05.663 --> 02:32:05.923]  U.S.
[02:32:05.963 --> 02:32:18.573]  Attorney Johnny Sutton and Alberto Gonzalez in the Criminal Civil Rights Investigation Division within the Department of Justice.
[02:32:19.113 --> 02:32:24.417]  For two years, he tried to get these specific allegations investigated and prosecuted.
[02:32:24.477 --> 02:32:25.298]  No one would touch it.
[02:32:26.075 --> 02:32:27.995]  Now it's blown up as a huge scandal.
[02:32:28.015 --> 02:32:33.177]  We see it's a sex scandal throughout the Texas Youth Commission.
[02:32:33.257 --> 02:32:33.997]  And let's be clear.
[02:32:34.437 --> 02:32:35.077]  Let's be clear.
[02:32:35.417 --> 02:32:43.379]  The federal prosecutor, the state prosecutors, the locals admit in letters that this is going on, but they say maybe they like it.
[02:32:43.759 --> 02:32:45.979]  They said outrageous things in the letters.
[02:32:45.999 --> 02:32:46.359]  The U.S.
[02:32:46.419 --> 02:32:52.041]  Attorney's Office letter, Johnny Simon's letter, written by Bill Bauman, the assistant U.S.
[02:32:52.061 --> 02:32:53.941]  attorney who prosecuted Gil Hernandez,
[02:32:54.560 --> 02:33:00.106]  There's outrageous things, like maybe there was no physical pain suffered by these children.
[02:33:00.687 --> 02:33:02.609]  Maybe it was consensual.
[02:33:02.649 --> 02:33:03.550]  Now let's be clear here.
[02:33:03.570 --> 02:33:04.651]  Maybe it was consensual.
[02:33:04.671 --> 02:33:11.939]  I mean, first of all, we're talking about criminal sodomy against minors, and the issue of consent is irrelevant.
[02:33:12.774 --> 02:33:13.935]  Well, let's flesh that out.
[02:33:29.508 --> 02:33:34.370]  For the most, you know, petty of stuff where somebody goes to the wrong site and it's 16-year-old girls.
[02:33:34.890 --> 02:33:46.396]  Now, you get into this case, this is people who are at a prison, in control, and they're doing this in an organized fashion, and they're hiring felons who have the same sick taste for this.
[02:33:46.436 --> 02:33:47.656]  This is a conspiracy.
[02:33:47.936 --> 02:33:49.137]  This is racketeering.
[02:33:49.397 --> 02:33:50.457]  And then you've got the U.S.
[02:33:50.517 --> 02:33:54.339]  Attorney and others saying, well, you know, maybe they like it.
[02:33:54.399 --> 02:33:55.059]  Maybe it didn't hurt.
[02:33:56.500 --> 02:34:02.824]  Consensual, it's illegal, it's statutory rape, and anytime someone is under your control, it's rape.
[02:34:02.864 --> 02:34:03.724]  This is incredible!
[02:34:03.905 --> 02:34:07.267]  Because this is the key here, Dr. Courts, and obviously you know this, you've written about it.
[02:34:07.887 --> 02:34:10.509]  It shows the mind warp that these U.S.
[02:34:10.569 --> 02:34:19.694]  attorneys and prosecutors and state prosecutors have gotten so into this culture of denial and evil that they would write letters legitimizing it!
[02:34:19.714 --> 02:34:22.976]  I mean, do they have any idea how incriminating that is for themselves?
[02:34:23.156 --> 02:34:25.878]  That letter is incredibly incriminating, and so is the one from the
[02:34:26.505 --> 02:34:40.702]  Uh, Criminal Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, because Alex, it's not only that there are instances of sodomy and other sexual abuse with minors going on in these institutions, but it's a conspiracy to commit these acts.
[02:34:41.539 --> 02:34:57.374]  Because to be hired, the people who were hired into the Texas Youth Commission system, they knew they had felony records, they knew they had sexual misconduct records, they knew they were looking at pornography on state computers on work time, and that was all okay.
[02:34:57.415 --> 02:34:59.777]  In fact, it was probably a prerequisite to get a job.
[02:35:01.605 --> 02:35:05.887]  And again, this also keeps good men and women from having jobs.
[02:35:06.168 --> 02:35:12.771]  Right, but a conspiracy to commit a crime is far more serious an offense than just the commission of the crime.
[02:35:12.831 --> 02:35:17.474]  And it also, again, these criminal networks can't have good cops, good jail guards in their system.
[02:35:18.034 --> 02:35:18.394]  That's right.
[02:35:18.475 --> 02:35:21.756]  Everybody has to be part of the deal, otherwise it can't go on.
[02:35:22.217 --> 02:35:25.238]  And this evidently went on in the Texas Youth Commission for years.
[02:35:26.906 --> 02:35:31.007]  It was at least, you know, Brzezinski has been trying to blow the whistle on it for two years.
[02:35:31.027 --> 02:35:42.671]  Well, I know parents for a long time have tried to go public, too, but usually they just send a SWAT team by the house and claim they're drug dealers or, you know, go raid their house and claim they're doing stuff and that's how these these rings work.
[02:35:42.991 --> 02:35:49.533]  Well, I'm publishing it, you know, chapter and verse on World Meth Daily right now and interviewing the people involved and we're going to get
[02:35:50.206 --> 02:35:51.227]  In front of the nation.
[02:35:51.547 --> 02:35:59.513]  So you really think the governor's office, I mean they claim they're going after all these people, but you know Rick Perry, I mean you're routinely up here criticizing him.
[02:35:59.533 --> 02:36:01.954]  Do you have any faith he'll have a real investigation now?
[02:36:02.375 --> 02:36:06.798]  I think they're going to have to do something with the light of day shown on it.
[02:36:06.858 --> 02:36:11.381]  I think they are going to, the entire board of this Texas Youth Commission has resigned.
[02:36:12.003 --> 02:36:15.184]  They don't have anybody left there running it who was running it before the scandal broke.
[02:36:15.204 --> 02:36:19.645]  Yeah, but they all, I mean, listen, these people, these prosecutors, all of them, need to be arrested now.
[02:36:20.286 --> 02:36:26.868]  I mean, there's a lot of people who need to be arrested right now, and this thing, I think, is going to take a huge, crashing fall.
[02:36:27.048 --> 02:36:29.368]  And I think some of them need to be executed, too.
[02:36:29.728 --> 02:36:32.889]  Because I think a conspiracy against children is one of the worst crimes there are.
[02:36:33.109 --> 02:36:34.590]  We need to teach these people a lesson.
[02:36:35.197 --> 02:36:41.721]  There's clearly, you know, the seriousness of these offenses, and people are saying, well, why isn't it just handled on a state level?
[02:36:42.061 --> 02:36:47.044]  When you get this kind of a criminal conspiracy operating within a statewide system,
[02:36:47.483 --> 02:36:51.286]  You know, you've got an offense here that's a federal level violation of the law.
[02:36:51.346 --> 02:36:53.247]  And it's being carried out by the bureaucracy.
[02:36:53.268 --> 02:37:00.393]  It's being carried out by the bureaucracy of the state, and the state attorney general evidently also declined to take this up and prosecute it.
[02:37:00.413 --> 02:37:02.815]  Now, you've got to know as bad as Texas is, Florida's worse.
[02:37:03.515 --> 02:37:04.036]  Well, I'm sure.
[02:37:04.076 --> 02:37:05.637]  And there's going to be a lot of finger-pointing.
[02:37:05.657 --> 02:37:10.641]  They're going to be saying, no, no, it's all, you know, Randall's fault.
[02:37:10.701 --> 02:37:15.625]  Randall Raymond over here in Ward County, because he wouldn't ask Abbott to come and do it.
[02:37:16.506 --> 02:37:18.127]  Who is the Attorney General in Texas?
[02:37:18.567 --> 02:37:21.408]  We have to wait until he's asked before Abbott can get involved.
[02:37:21.828 --> 02:37:39.954]  Well, that's just not the case because you've got the Texas Ranger showing that report to everybody at every level of government and saying, at your level, at the level of the Attorney General, you don't need the permission of the county to go into this because it's a statewide offense committed across counties.
[02:37:40.700 --> 02:37:43.702]  So you don't need to wait until some county asks you to come in.
[02:37:43.802 --> 02:37:44.982]  Oh, that's ridiculous.
[02:37:45.042 --> 02:37:46.843]  Yeah, I mean, absolutely.
[02:37:46.863 --> 02:37:48.104]  I mean, just the excuses.
[02:37:48.544 --> 02:37:54.707]  Why do you think that these different high-level officials would write letters trying to legitimize this back to investigators?
[02:37:54.747 --> 02:37:56.889]  I mean, that is just off the charts.
[02:37:57.149 --> 02:38:00.691]  Yeah, I think they just lost all contacts with reality.
[02:38:01.011 --> 02:38:08.855]  They forget they're writing about sodomy and saying that you have to have physical pain or that consent makes a difference when you're talking about children.
[02:38:09.676 --> 02:38:12.923]  We were innocent children, most of them in there for no reason.
[02:38:13.324 --> 02:38:19.217]  Right, or, you know, they're in there, supposedly, wards of the state, not in there to be made into a sex camp.
[02:38:20.817 --> 02:38:30.581]  Now, I don't want to go into too many of the details, but closing, because all I have is in the papers, what we've heard from law enforcement sources, about the, I mean, any other details about the full nature?
[02:38:30.601 --> 02:38:31.922]  Because you said sex parties.
[02:38:32.702 --> 02:38:39.025]  Some of the more egregious statements that are coming out is evidently the boys were raped, you know, they were roused from their sleep at night.
[02:38:39.525 --> 02:38:45.628]  They were made to participate in group sex parties with the guards and other supervisors at these institutions.
[02:38:46.409 --> 02:38:48.870]  I'm sure there was a whole range of offenses going on.
[02:38:48.910 --> 02:38:50.550]  Sounds like just a nightmare.
[02:38:51.110 --> 02:39:01.873]  It was a nightmare, and I'm sure any boy who was in that knew within the first hour they were in the facility what the whole game of the whole joint was, and either you played or you got badly abused in other ways.
[02:39:02.193 --> 02:39:03.613]  But it looks like if 93% of their
[02:39:07.052 --> 02:39:17.316]  It's an institutionalized form of pedophilia aimed at sexual abuse of boys who were underage by people who were hired by the state of Texas to be their supervisors and administrators.
[02:39:31.152 --> 02:39:55.153]  If the state of Texas is putting, in a position of authority, pedophiles to prey on a captive group of minor youth who have no alternative but to stay locked up in the facility and be abused... You know, when some dirtbag pedophile grabs a ten-year-old off the street and rapes him, people call it the death penalty, and this is being whitewashed in our media, and then you read a letter from a state official saying, well, maybe it didn't hurt, maybe they wanted it.
[02:39:55.353 --> 02:39:55.914]  I mean, this is...
[02:39:58.636 --> 02:39:59.916]  What is going on here?
[02:40:00.436 --> 02:40:03.497]  And if you have Attorney General Gonzalez and U.S.
[02:40:03.517 --> 02:40:06.418]  Attorney Johnny Sutton saying, no, but you know, it's okay.
[02:40:06.518 --> 02:40:24.402]  When Mexico asks, we'll go prosecute a law enforcement officer who violated the civil rights of an illegal alien who was in here smuggling drugs or participating in a conspiracy to smuggle human beings in here and driving in a van or riding in a van that's trying to run over the police officer.
[02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:28.061]  I mean, their civil rights have to be protected by Johnny Sutton.
[02:40:28.441 --> 02:40:37.305]  What about the civil rights of these incriminated, you know, these boys who are incarcerated here and are being pounded on by the guards who are hired to be their supervisors?
[02:40:38.986 --> 02:40:42.567]  Well, it's just going to get... It's ugly and it's going to get uglier.
[02:40:42.927 --> 02:40:49.530]  Well, I'm just mad that they're arresting people for knowingly hiring thousands of felons at thousands.
[02:40:49.870 --> 02:40:52.351]  You had to be a felon, but... I'm asking the questions, Alex.
[02:40:52.992 --> 02:40:54.473]  Why did it take two years?
[02:40:54.533 --> 02:40:57.134]  What were you guys doing when you had this information?
[02:40:57.594 --> 02:40:58.655]  Why did you sit on it?
[02:40:59.215 --> 02:41:00.015]  What were you thinking?
[02:41:00.235 --> 02:41:01.616]  Maybe they should ask Jeff Gannon.
[02:41:01.976 --> 02:41:02.957]  Did they participate?
[02:41:03.017 --> 02:41:03.717]  Maybe they should.
[02:41:04.097 --> 02:41:07.639]  Were you participating in allowing this culture to exist?
[02:41:08.279 --> 02:41:09.399]  Are you going to be culpable?
[02:41:09.620 --> 02:41:12.681]  Well, look, this isn't your first rodeo, Dr. Corsi.
[02:41:12.701 --> 02:41:13.961]  Dr. Corsi, you've done research.
[02:41:13.981 --> 02:41:14.622]  You've been around.
[02:41:15.302 --> 02:41:17.023]  This just keeps popping up with Republicans.
[02:41:18.681 --> 02:41:19.142]  It does.
[02:41:19.162 --> 02:41:22.588]  And I think the American people are going to get sick and tired of it.
[02:41:22.868 --> 02:41:24.331]  And the problem is...
[02:41:25.356 --> 02:41:28.598]  You know, a lot of these issues are bipartisan issues.
[02:41:28.718 --> 02:41:34.022]  I mean, the reason the Democrats won't look into it is the Democrats don't want to offend...
[02:41:55.776 --> 02:41:56.517]  Deep, deep, deep.
[02:41:57.438 --> 02:41:58.939]  And it's got to be exposed.
[02:41:58.999 --> 02:42:01.061]  The people have got to be aware of it.
[02:42:01.141 --> 02:42:04.804]  Republican or Democrat, this behavior is absolutely unacceptable.
[02:42:05.324 --> 02:42:07.766]  It's not only criminal, it's shocking and horrifying.
[02:42:08.527 --> 02:42:11.970]  To think that we would allow this to go on in the United States of America is horrifying.
[02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:15.732]  Any inkling on what's coming up next?
[02:42:15.772 --> 02:42:19.716]  You're talking to the governor's office and they're... I'm digging into it.
[02:42:20.957 --> 02:42:23.219]  These cases take a while to dig into.
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:24.941]  More facts will come to light.
[02:42:25.421 --> 02:42:28.144]  But tomorrow I'll have another major article on World Net Daily.
[02:42:28.684 --> 02:42:34.550]  And I'll report tomorrow that the sexual abuse scandal is now known to be widespread.
[02:42:35.322 --> 02:42:42.323]  All the offices of the Texas Youth Commission throughout the state involved, and employees from the top to the bottom, all involved.
[02:42:42.843 --> 02:42:49.864]  Thousands of cases are likely to be, should be, hundreds of investigations and arrests and prosecutions.
[02:42:50.425 --> 02:42:52.365]  And if there aren't, we'll want to know why there aren't.
[02:42:53.345 --> 02:42:58.306]  Well, because they'll tell the judge, you bring me in here, I'm going to burn you.
[02:42:58.966 --> 02:43:02.067]  Well, they'll tell them the boys didn't suffer any pain and they consented to it.
[02:43:02.507 --> 02:43:04.067]  That's what the letters from the U.S.
[02:43:04.107 --> 02:43:04.527]  Attorney
[02:43:05.091 --> 02:43:10.075]  And the Criminal Division of the Justice Department say, the Civil Rights Division.
[02:43:10.095 --> 02:43:13.897]  Look, I linked to the letters today in the article I wrote in WorldNetDaily.
[02:43:14.017 --> 02:43:15.158]  Read the actual letters.
[02:43:15.198 --> 02:43:17.900]  Now you were telling my producers that some of the government sites are now down?
[02:43:19.001 --> 02:43:22.343]  I told, SPP.gov has been down all day.
[02:43:22.363 --> 02:43:26.626]  They say the path worked, the path name to it is not valid.
[02:43:27.153 --> 02:43:36.128]  I've been trying to get into the SPP, the Security and Prosperity Partnership, the North America primary website of the Department of Commerce all day long, and it no longer exists.
[02:43:36.148 --> 02:43:39.554]  Uh-oh, they may have decided to pull that.
[02:43:40.055 --> 02:43:40.516]  I don't know.
[02:43:41.716 --> 02:43:43.877]  First assumption is going to be it's a technical glitch.
[02:43:43.937 --> 02:43:45.558]  Let's see how long it stays down.
[02:43:45.698 --> 02:43:48.320]  Well, I hope that's not the case, because we need that for research purposes.
[02:43:48.660 --> 02:43:50.101]  Dr. Corsi, thanks for all the time.
[02:43:50.821 --> 02:43:51.502]  Alex, anytime.
[02:43:51.522 --> 02:43:52.662]  Always a pleasure to be with you.
[02:43:52.702 --> 02:43:53.143]  Thank you.
[02:43:53.303 --> 02:43:55.044]  And I know it's tough to cover these stories.
[02:43:55.104 --> 02:43:59.246]  It takes bravery, too, because this is a national, international network, but good job.
[02:43:59.866 --> 02:44:00.767]  It's got to be covered.
[02:44:00.807 --> 02:44:01.327]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:44:01.607 --> 02:44:02.588]  Yeah.
[02:44:02.628 --> 02:44:07.411]  The group doing this, folks, is International in Scope, and they're the folks that carried out 9-11.
[02:44:08.860 --> 02:44:12.502]  They're the people killing our country, they're the people getting rid of our borders, they're the people doing it all.
[02:44:12.522 --> 02:44:13.103]  Do you understand?
[02:44:13.143 --> 02:44:13.843]  They're evil!
[02:44:13.963 --> 02:44:14.203]  Evil!
[02:44:14.223 --> 02:44:18.426]  You've got 4,700 employees, 4,600 employees, and over half of them are felons.
[02:44:18.486 --> 02:44:19.066]  You understand?
[02:44:19.086 --> 02:44:19.827]  They need felons.
[02:44:32.754 --> 02:44:35.255]  And I'm telling you, I'm telling you, they're crooks.
[02:44:36.236 --> 02:44:39.358]  Most people in these key positions in government are crooks.
[02:44:40.038 --> 02:44:54.225]  And if you see a CPS worker, folks, I don't mean the type that are involved in adoption or the ones that are involved, you know, with autistic children, but I mean the hardcore Storm Trooper, go grab the baby CPS worker.
[02:44:54.846 --> 02:45:00.949]  Conservatively, half the time, they like to rape children, small children.
[02:45:01.667 --> 02:45:04.529]  The worst, I mean, and just to have to look at these people.
[02:45:05.029 --> 02:45:09.071]  And I've been to court, I've covered these folks, I've seen them when they're grabbing kids at the hospital.
[02:45:09.611 --> 02:45:11.152]  You talk about tearing your heart out, folks.
[02:45:11.192 --> 02:45:15.334]  I'd rather charge, you know, a machine gun nest than have to watch the things I've seen.
[02:45:16.135 --> 02:45:23.059]  I've seen cops, you know, you open the door and they're choking a woman, telling her to sign her baby away, and the cop stands up and yells, get out of here, with his hand still on her neck.
[02:45:23.119 --> 02:45:24.820]  I mean, I've seen hell, folks.
[02:45:24.940 --> 02:45:25.500]  I've seen hell.
[02:45:26.551 --> 02:45:27.972]  And I know they're all over the place.
[02:45:28.032 --> 02:45:29.772]  I mean, literally, real live monsters.
[02:45:30.332 --> 02:45:33.113]  They don't have green tentacles and slime coming out of their mouths.
[02:45:33.133 --> 02:45:33.934]  They're human beings.
[02:45:34.954 --> 02:45:37.715]  You know, they're not, you know, they're not boogeymen under the bed, folks.
[02:45:37.735 --> 02:45:38.415]  They're real.
[02:45:38.455 --> 02:45:39.256]  They got guns.
[02:45:39.296 --> 02:45:40.196]  They got badges.
[02:45:41.836 --> 02:45:43.237]  And they're going to carry out more terror.
[02:45:43.777 --> 02:45:48.759]  Again, their bosses carry out the terror so they can bring in the police state to stop us from stopping them.
[02:45:49.659 --> 02:45:51.020]  Don't you understand that, America?
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:54.521]  We have become so evil.
[02:45:55.666 --> 02:45:58.328]  These people are all over the place.
[02:45:58.348 --> 02:45:59.490]  They're everywhere.
[02:46:00.711 --> 02:46:04.974]  And, you know, some of them just do it for money, others do it for power, others do it for prestige.
[02:46:05.255 --> 02:46:09.018]  You know, a lot of it's just financial corruption, boss hog type stuff.
[02:46:09.058 --> 02:46:14.783]  But then see, then they can't tattle on the pedophile because then they'll get in trouble for their bid rigging.
[02:46:14.823 --> 02:46:21.810]  And then they can't tattle on the... And then you get to the top of it, it's a bunch of eugenics.
[02:46:23.010 --> 02:46:24.833]  We've got to get an article out on this.
[02:46:39.392 --> 02:46:40.772]  And he just broke all that here.
[02:46:41.273 --> 02:46:44.814]  We need to get this out immediately on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[02:46:44.854 --> 02:46:45.774]  I'm going to twist some arms.
[02:46:46.134 --> 02:46:47.694]  But I twist the arms of my writers every day.
[02:46:47.994 --> 02:46:51.795]  Hey, listeners out there, you should go write articles about this just off the facts Corsi laid out.
[02:46:52.236 --> 02:46:58.717]  You should email him to Kevin at InfoWars.com and Aaron at InfoWars.com and Ryan at InfoWars.com.
[02:46:58.737 --> 02:46:59.258]  We'll post them.
[02:46:59.278 --> 02:47:00.058]  We can't do it all.
[02:47:01.258 --> 02:47:05.759]  I mean, just take what Corsi said, take the other stuff out of the WorldNet Daily article, integrate it with the other articles.
[02:47:05.779 --> 02:47:07.960]  There's hundreds of articles in the state of Texas now about this.
[02:47:09.975 --> 02:47:13.939]  I mean all those years I told you that they were going to make you use your driver's license to buy and sell.
[02:47:13.979 --> 02:47:15.881]  It's going to be on Fox TV locally tonight here.
[02:47:16.822 --> 02:47:22.107]  All those years I told you they were doing this in the juvenile halls in Texas.
[02:47:23.068 --> 02:47:23.969]  That it was a guild.
[02:47:24.858 --> 02:47:25.599]  That it was a group?
[02:47:25.659 --> 02:47:26.659]  I mean, now it's in the news.
[02:47:26.719 --> 02:47:28.400]  I mean, folks, we know what we're talking about.
[02:47:28.420 --> 02:47:31.062]  Believe me, I wish this wasn't true.
[02:47:31.262 --> 02:47:32.383]  They carried out 9-11.
[02:47:32.403 --> 02:47:36.206]  And they're saying, get ready for nukes and bio-weapons?
[02:47:36.866 --> 02:47:40.949]  I mean, I don't want to be there when my babies are dying because these killers released a bunch of bird flu.
[02:47:41.369 --> 02:47:43.050]  Because they want to reorganize society.
[02:47:43.571 --> 02:47:44.571]  They enjoy it!
[02:47:45.312 --> 02:47:47.313]  You understand this is life and death.
[02:47:49.374 --> 02:47:50.675]  Help us get the word out.
[02:47:51.516 --> 02:47:52.597]  Go to Infowars.com.
[02:47:53.749 --> 02:47:55.270]  Get America Freedom to Fascism.
[02:47:55.311 --> 02:47:56.932]  Get the new film, Riddles in Stone.
[02:47:56.992 --> 02:47:59.354]  America's Secret Beginnings, we just started carrying, just came out.
[02:47:59.935 --> 02:48:00.835]  Get Terror Storm.
[02:48:00.875 --> 02:48:01.376]  Make copies.
[02:48:01.396 --> 02:48:02.157]  Get them out to people.
[02:48:02.657 --> 02:48:03.658]  Go to the message boards.
[02:48:03.698 --> 02:48:04.639]  Go to your email list.
[02:48:04.679 --> 02:48:05.780]  Go to your MySpace account.
[02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:07.161]  Call into Talk Radio.
[02:48:07.201 --> 02:48:08.823]  Tell them about InfoWars.com.
[02:48:09.423 --> 02:48:10.684]  All I want to do is reach people.
[02:48:10.744 --> 02:48:11.885]  I almost don't want to get bigger.
[02:48:11.905 --> 02:48:15.489]  It makes me more of a target for these people, but then that's only 10% of my psyche.
[02:48:15.509 --> 02:48:17.931]  The other 90% says, no, I want to get as big as possible.
[02:48:18.571 --> 02:48:20.091]  And I want to force them to move against us.
[02:48:20.151 --> 02:48:23.492]  I want to just fight them and fight them and fight them until we're at the gates of hell.
[02:48:24.432 --> 02:48:24.732]  You know?
[02:48:24.852 --> 02:48:26.733]  I mean, I just want to reach people.
[02:48:26.813 --> 02:48:29.633]  I want to save these people in these torture camps all over the world.
[02:48:30.094 --> 02:48:32.074]  I want to help the people being killed in Iraq.
[02:48:32.134 --> 02:48:33.414]  I want to help our Americans.
[02:48:34.154 --> 02:48:35.255]  I want to beat these people.
[02:48:35.715 --> 02:48:38.415]  I want to help the Mexicans in the colonies down in Mexico.
[02:48:38.755 --> 02:48:39.796]  I want to help everybody.
[02:48:40.176 --> 02:48:41.396]  Help us get the word out.
[02:48:48.087 --> 02:48:53.554]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:53.914 --> 02:49:01.544]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.245 --> 02:49:09.287]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.687 --> 02:49:21.151]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.431 --> 02:49:25.012]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.372 --> 02:49:27.333]  It's an anthology of government crimes.

[02:49:45.032 --> 02:49:50.276]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:50.416 --> 02:49:58.502]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:58.762 --> 02:50:05.807]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:05.987 --> 02:50:07.268]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:50:07.348 --> 02:50:13.233]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:13.433 --> 02:50:18.517]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:18.637 --> 02:50:27.525]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:27.785 --> 02:50:31.087]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:50:33.169 --> 02:50:33.509]  We're good.

[02:51:59.641 --> 02:52:07.269]  Find out that our government's run by devil worshippers, and then you'll understand why they do what they do.
[02:52:08.030 --> 02:52:08.450]  You see?
[02:52:09.031 --> 02:52:11.473]  You need to get The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C.
[02:52:13.066 --> 02:52:13.346]  Hi there.
[02:52:13.366 --> 02:52:19.612]  It's so nice to talk to you and this is one of the most powerful shows I've heard you do since I've been listening to you, which is on Coast to Coast, The Last Visit.
[02:52:35.518 --> 02:52:43.505]  Now, I've been listening to you every single day, and today I'm listening to you, and all of a sudden, I lost the stream.
[02:52:44.326 --> 02:52:47.829]  And it makes me... Dr. Corsi said he was having problems online.
[02:52:48.970 --> 02:52:50.152]  I wasn't offline.
[02:52:50.732 --> 02:52:53.034]  So, I tried to get you back up.
[02:52:53.094 --> 02:52:57.458]  I couldn't get you back up, no matter how hard I tried.
[02:52:57.558 --> 02:52:59.120]  Well, the problem is, we do have
[02:52:59.878 --> 02:53:03.459]  A lot of people tuning into the streams and I think we were having a few glitches today.
[02:53:03.479 --> 02:53:05.140]  Were you listening via the network?
[02:53:05.160 --> 02:53:08.661]  Were you listening via the Genesis streams off their site or my streams?
[02:53:09.081 --> 02:53:09.522]  iTunes.
[02:53:09.782 --> 02:53:11.262]  I was listening to you on iTunes.
[02:53:11.342 --> 02:53:12.543]  I've been listening every day.
[02:53:12.563 --> 02:53:15.704]  No, no, but are you listening to the Genesis provided stream or the stream I provide?
[02:53:15.924 --> 02:53:17.064]  Yes, Genesis.
[02:53:17.625 --> 02:53:19.085]  Well, we'll have to get them to work on that.
[02:53:19.125 --> 02:53:20.045]  I appreciate your call.
[02:53:20.065 --> 02:53:20.546]  We're out of time.
[02:53:20.586 --> 02:53:22.066]  Call me back tomorrow and we can talk more.
[02:53:22.446 --> 02:53:23.147]  Mike in Florida.
[02:53:23.167 --> 02:53:23.707]  You're on the air.
[02:53:23.747 --> 02:53:24.147]  Go ahead.
[02:53:24.907 --> 02:53:25.647]  Yes, hi Alex.
[02:53:25.667 --> 02:53:26.068]  How are you?
[02:53:26.328 --> 02:53:26.628]  Good, sir.
[02:53:26.648 --> 02:53:26.948]  Go ahead.
[02:53:27.726 --> 02:53:33.887]  I just wanted to let you know that Dylan Avery put up... Yeah, the Building 7 Blueprint Diagrams.
[02:53:33.907 --> 02:53:35.227]  We're going to get them up on Prison Planet.
[02:53:35.787 --> 02:53:36.288]  Okay, great.
[02:53:36.388 --> 02:53:36.868]  Anything else?
[02:53:37.648 --> 02:53:43.589]  I just want to know, last week you were saying how none of the Truth Movement sites were covering the Rosie O'Donnell case.
[02:53:43.609 --> 02:53:45.089]  Did that run a site, Truth or Lies?
[02:53:45.109 --> 02:53:46.389]  Well, they did after it broke.
[02:53:46.569 --> 02:53:47.550]  Just at first, they weren't.
[02:53:48.130 --> 02:53:49.250]  Well, I was covering it.
[02:53:49.390 --> 02:53:50.650]  I always cover your stories.
[02:53:50.710 --> 02:53:52.230]  I put your stories all over my site.
[02:53:52.330 --> 02:53:55.551]  I have your films all over my site, so... What's your website?
[02:53:56.391 --> 02:53:58.714]  It's TruthOrLies.org.
[02:53:58.834 --> 02:53:59.554]  Oh yeah, I've seen it.
[02:53:59.594 --> 02:54:00.095]  Great site.
[02:54:00.115 --> 02:54:00.956]  Good to hear from you, Mike.
[02:54:00.996 --> 02:54:01.857]  Sorry to hear it again.
[02:54:02.177 --> 02:54:02.497]  You bet.
[02:54:02.577 --> 02:54:03.959]  Lucas in Texas, go ahead.
[02:54:05.921 --> 02:54:06.802]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:54:06.862 --> 02:54:11.487]  I'm sorry, I didn't want to call in today, but I got some very time-sensitive, important information to give you.
[02:54:12.027 --> 02:54:15.531]  I didn't know if you knew about the Mark Cuban Halifax connection.
[02:54:15.973 --> 02:54:24.699]  But Halifaxon was the biggest 9-11 truther on YouTube, and Magnolia Pictures singled him out and deleted all his YouTube videos off.
[02:54:25.220 --> 02:54:27.622]  Okay, now this was done by Mark Cuban.
[02:54:27.802 --> 02:54:30.063]  What videos did this guy have up?
[02:54:30.404 --> 02:54:36.508]  He had almost 200 9-11 videos with about almost a million websites linked to his different videos.
[02:54:37.089 --> 02:54:39.831]  Okay, I remember hearing that name and seeing some of those videos.
[02:54:39.891 --> 02:54:41.572]  What did Magnolia Pictures do?
[02:54:42.310 --> 02:54:49.977]  Uh, they basically subpoenaed Google, YouTube, and iFilms to find out who he was, and had all his accounts and all his 9-11 videos deleted.
[02:54:50.017 --> 02:54:50.218]  Why?
[02:54:50.258 --> 02:54:51.399]  Because he had their stuff up?
[02:54:51.899 --> 02:54:56.884]  He had a small clip of Enron, of the smartest guys in the room, in his account.
[02:54:57.224 --> 02:55:00.347]  But that's the thing, they didn't ask him to take it down, they deleted all his 9-11 videos.
[02:55:01.681 --> 02:55:03.383]  Okay, this is huge.
[02:55:03.483 --> 02:55:08.749]  How can somebody that's going to promote loose change, on the other hand, single out a 9-11 truther?
[02:55:10.290 --> 02:55:12.693]  How many Magnolia videos are on YouTube?
[02:55:12.713 --> 02:55:14.615]  You need to do an article about it.
[02:55:14.635 --> 02:55:15.316]  We're out of time.
[02:55:15.836 --> 02:55:17.117]  Get a story together with the facts.
[02:55:17.998 --> 02:55:20.401]  Let's go ahead and talk to Morgan in Washington.
[02:55:20.801 --> 02:55:21.222]  Go ahead.
[02:55:22.129 --> 02:55:24.650]  Yeah, Alex, I just want to tell you something real quick.
[02:55:24.730 --> 02:55:25.931]  It's interesting up here.
[02:55:25.951 --> 02:55:31.813]  I live up close to the Canadian border, and you know, soon they're going to have to use the chipped passports that cost about $95.
[02:55:32.293 --> 02:55:37.316]  But they're saying now they're going to accept specially enabled state driver's licenses that are really North American Union IDs.
[02:55:37.816 --> 02:55:40.437]  They absolutely had Michael Chertoff here.
[02:55:40.908 --> 02:55:54.915]  With our illustrious Governor Gregoire, and they graciously consented to let these people who live on the border, they go back and forth all the time, have a driver's license with a chip in it for only 45 extra dollars.
[02:55:55.956 --> 02:55:58.377]  That's the full North American Union idea, absolutely.
[02:55:58.437 --> 02:55:59.597]  Well said, it's documented.
[02:56:00.078 --> 02:56:02.459]  Andrew in Missouri, last caller, hit us.
[02:56:05.430 --> 02:56:06.070]  Yeah, he's gone.
[02:56:06.291 --> 02:56:06.671]  Alright.
[02:56:07.131 --> 02:56:07.932]  Sorry, no more calls.
[02:56:08.032 --> 02:56:08.532]  Out of time.
[02:56:09.012 --> 02:56:11.034]  Seriously, if you believe in what we're doing, support us.

[02:56:15.817 --> 02:56:16.317]  Get them out.
[02:56:16.618 --> 02:56:19.099]  Expose the terrorists before they make their next move.
[02:56:19.159 --> 02:56:20.240]  We can stop them.
[02:56:20.540 --> 02:56:22.401]  God bless you all!
