[00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:05.755]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.415 --> 00:00:07.475]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.316]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.956 --> 00:00:10.776]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.516 --> 00:00:12.396]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.077 --> 00:00:16.738]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:21.339]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.613 --> 00:00:38.553]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:38.593 --> 00:00:48.198]  We've got a big broadcast lined up for you today on this live Wednesday edition, the 14th day of March, 2007.
[00:00:48.238 --> 00:00:55.262]  Asian and European stocks have plunged today.
[00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:57.843]  They're, of course, many hours ahead of us.
[00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:07.979]  Asia as many as 18 hours ahead, Europe 8 to 6 hours ahead, depending on which region.
[00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:21.924]  Asian stocks plunged and European shares opened sharply lower after Wall Street shocked its second biggest point drop in four years and rattled already nervous markets worldwide.
[00:01:22.564 --> 00:01:27.086]  Currently, the Dow Jones Industrials has lost quite a few points and is gyrating up and down.
[00:01:28.786 --> 00:01:40.109]  The trouble came just as international markets were recovering in recent days from sharp declines in early March amid concerns about overvalued stock prices and slower U.S.
[00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.029]  economic growth.
[00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:46.091]  Really, last week they were trying to pump you up, to sucker you in even deeper.
[00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:51.592]  Remember all those articles I read where they were saying it was the best ever, milk and honey?
[00:01:53.453 --> 00:01:57.176]  Your government media didn't twist anything they care about.
[00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:58.517]  Alright, I'm not going to get cynical.
[00:01:58.978 --> 00:01:59.418]  Not yet.
[00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:04.382]  But those worries resurfaced as troubles at U.S.
[00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:17.513]  subprime lenders, now it's lenders, and lackluster retail sales pushed the Dow Jones Industrials down nearly 2% Tuesday, sparking sell-offs across Asia.
[00:02:18.943 --> 00:02:29.105]  Stocks in Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and India and Australia all fell more than 2%, while shares in Singapore and the Philippines tumbled at least 3%.
[00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:38.287]  In Europe, London's FTSE 100 dropped 1.7% shortly after the open, while Germany's DAX lost 1.8%.
[00:02:38.327 --> 00:02:39.068]  France's CAC 40 was also 1.7% lower.
[00:02:46.957 --> 00:02:55.200]  On the Tokyo Exchange, Asia's biggest bourse, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index sank 5,0195 points or 2.92% to finish at 16,676.89 points.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.142]  Foreign investors who bought up stocks
[00:03:09.927 --> 00:03:19.272]  During the recent rally, Lead the Selling Traders said Hong Kong's Xing Index fell 2.6%, Indian stocks dropped 3.1%, and Philippine stocks plunged 3.4%.
[00:03:19.412 --> 00:03:22.133]  Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 242.66 points, or 1.97, to
[00:03:34.805 --> 00:03:37.826]  75.96% amid concerns about problems at U.S.
[00:03:38.027 --> 00:03:41.868]  subprime lenders who provide mortgages to people with poor credit.
[00:03:42.448 --> 00:03:42.868]  The U.S.
[00:03:42.908 --> 00:03:53.832]  Commerce Department also said sales at retails for retailers rose less than expected at 0.1% in February, suggesting consumer spending might be waning.
[00:03:56.433 --> 00:03:57.794]  So that's the news there.
[00:04:02.017 --> 00:04:05.380]  Meanwhile, late mortgage payments reach all-time high.
[00:04:06.321 --> 00:04:12.326]  It is a record for non-payment of mortgages across the country.
[00:04:13.707 --> 00:04:29.421]  And these mortgage companies are so leveraged, are so incredibly leveraged right now, that even just a payment a month or two late can cause domino devastation to the markets.
[00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:34.212]  We'll go over that when we get back.
[00:04:34.272 --> 00:04:42.039]  If you want good news, they're talking about American Idol and Britney Spears on other channels.
[00:04:44.461 --> 00:04:49.305]  The neocons are talking about Hillary wanting Gonzales to resign and how she's a hypocrite.
[00:04:50.146 --> 00:04:51.447]  Tell us something we don't know.
[00:04:51.467 --> 00:04:52.548]  Alright.
[00:04:52.628 --> 00:04:53.809]  Masses of news straight ahead.
[00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:55.010]  It's a huge transmission.
[00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.231]  Tell you about the guesthood.
[00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:05.616]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:06.017 --> 00:05:13.626]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:14.338 --> 00:05:21.402]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:21.782 --> 00:05:33.228]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:33.528 --> 00:05:37.130]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.431]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:43.613]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:05:57.222 --> 00:06:02.425]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:06:02.585 --> 00:06:10.670]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.974]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:06:18.154 --> 00:06:19.434]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:06:19.514 --> 00:06:25.415]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:06:25.615 --> 00:06:30.676]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:06:30.796 --> 00:06:39.678]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:06:39.938 --> 00:06:43.239]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:45.479]  I think?
[00:06:56.787 --> 00:06:59.489]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:01.830]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.592]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:07:05.032 --> 00:07:09.415]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[00:07:09.515 --> 00:07:10.096]  Here's why.
[00:07:10.116 --> 00:07:16.720]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:23.502]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[00:07:23.662 --> 00:07:27.383]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:07:27.604 --> 00:07:31.825]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:07:32.305 --> 00:07:39.512]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:07:39.932 --> 00:07:40.633]  Get control.
[00:07:40.773 --> 00:07:41.373]  Get relief.
[00:07:41.573 --> 00:07:42.334]  Get some sleep.
[00:07:42.634 --> 00:07:43.635]  Go to www.outand90.com.
[00:07:43.675 --> 00:07:44.576]  That's www.outand90.com.
[00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:45.177]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:07:45.417 --> 00:07:45.637]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:07:56.801 --> 00:08:01.825]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:02.225 --> 00:08:04.466]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:28.338]  There is no way to air it all in one show.
[00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:36.280]  It's a 53-minute speech on two separate occasions.
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:44.682]  Listeners mailed it to us, and then I can't find it in my office or any of my storage buildings.
[00:08:46.543 --> 00:08:48.963]  Every time I ever tried to... I just don't have the staff.
[00:08:49.083 --> 00:08:50.544]  You know, I get sent hundreds of videos.
[00:08:51.383 --> 00:08:54.785]  And then we just don't have the staff or the time or the energy to go through it all.
[00:08:55.505 --> 00:09:02.869]  But I don't want to tell you not to send us videos because we do look at a lot of it and we do find a lot of it because of you.
[00:09:04.249 --> 00:09:19.357]  But if you do have the Ron Paul neocon speech that he gave, what, almost four years ago on VHS, send it to us this time and we'll put it in a glass case and hang it from the ceiling so nobody can lose it.
[00:09:21.298 --> 00:09:27.320]  But we did find a YouTube site that has basically every speech Ron Paul has given in the last few years.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.501]  And it does have the Neocon speech, which I think is one of his most powerful, up there in total.
[00:09:35.222 --> 00:09:36.822]  And it really upset the White House.
[00:09:37.002 --> 00:09:37.922]  And we've got it.
[00:09:37.982 --> 00:09:38.883]  We're grabbing it.
[00:09:39.303 --> 00:09:40.983]  The network's grabbing the audio.
[00:09:41.023 --> 00:09:43.784]  We're grabbing the video here, though it's not that good a quality.
[00:09:45.183 --> 00:09:59.686]  And during the show today, I'll air at least 10-15 minutes of it, and then tomorrow I'll try to air 10-15 minutes of it, and then we'll try to air the rest of it on Friday, even if we have to cancel some guests we've got coming up in the next few days.
[00:10:00.306 --> 00:10:11.948]  I've always wanted to air this Neocon speech, which I had a chance to read, and then one time I did watch a few minutes of it on one of the magically hiding tapes around here.
[00:10:13.064 --> 00:10:15.945]  Literally, folks, we have just mountains of tapes to the ceiling.
[00:10:17.345 --> 00:10:25.827]  That's why it really helps when you tape stuff off television for us and then you mark it and say what's where on the tape or on the DVD.
[00:10:26.628 --> 00:10:28.708]  Quite a way to start a radio show.
[00:10:28.848 --> 00:10:33.189]  I'm Alex Jones and I'm really trying my best to fight the tyranny.
[00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.171]  I'm really trying my best to wake people up and get them involved in the fight against the tyranny.
[00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:42.872]  I'm really trying to save this country because I live here.
[00:10:42.932 --> 00:10:43.772]  I love this nation.
[00:10:44.492 --> 00:10:45.532]  My family lives here.
[00:10:45.592 --> 00:10:49.754]  We have long, deep roots into the soil of this nation.
[00:10:50.774 --> 00:10:53.014]  And it's not just that I want to save the United States.
[00:10:54.235 --> 00:11:00.336]  I mean, if the country was changing into something that was better, and it was really better, I'd probably be all for it.
[00:11:00.796 --> 00:11:02.097]  I'm not adverse to change.
[00:11:03.837 --> 00:11:04.577]  If it's good change.
[00:11:05.558 --> 00:11:06.318]  In fact, I like change.
[00:11:07.783 --> 00:11:08.823]  But what the U.S.
[00:11:08.883 --> 00:11:19.446]  is being replaced with is total and complete oppression, degradation, a dumbed-down, just really disgusting public.
[00:11:21.326 --> 00:11:23.406]  I can't even hardly listen.
[00:11:23.426 --> 00:11:27.807]  And growing up, I didn't understand what it meant to be sardonic.
[00:11:28.107 --> 00:11:28.787]  Now I do.
[00:11:30.128 --> 00:11:33.668]  And I guess you become sardonic because you don't have a high view of yourself.
[00:11:34.489 --> 00:11:35.869]  I don't have a high view of myself.
[00:11:37.924 --> 00:11:57.895]  Half the time I look like a overweight, you know, hunchbacked, disheveled individual these days because I'm such a sequestered, you know, like some type of old tinkerer who just constantly works over the stove, but over the foundry.
[00:11:59.976 --> 00:12:01.177]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:12:02.918 --> 00:12:05.760]  I just listen to the public and I look at them.
[00:12:06.553 --> 00:12:18.177]  And I look at their dull eyes, and I listen to their even duller statements, and I don't have some good feeling of being smarter than them, or better informed than them.
[00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:21.978]  It's a feeling of horror and disgust.
[00:12:24.278 --> 00:12:35.562]  And I was driving into the office this morning, and I flipped over and listened to the neocon in nonpartisan clothing, Glenn Beck,
[00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:43.057]  Going into how horrible the pedophiles are and how once you're convicted of it, you should never be let out of prison again.
[00:12:43.077 --> 00:12:45.980]  And just how terrible it is.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.003]  On and on and on.
[00:12:52.387 --> 00:12:55.871]  But he'll never talk about DynCorp running child kidnapping rings.
[00:12:57.099 --> 00:12:59.560]  He'll never talk about Halliburton doing it.
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.821]  He'll never talk about Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove.
[00:13:03.301 --> 00:13:07.323]  He'll never talk about the 3,000 plus missing children in Florida grabbed by CPS.
[00:13:07.663 --> 00:13:08.483]  I mean, they're just gone.
[00:13:08.884 --> 00:13:11.665]  They found a lot of them dead in other states or other countries.
[00:13:13.405 --> 00:13:19.347]  Some are sold if they're, you know, past the age of 10, right into sweatshops overseas.
[00:13:19.387 --> 00:13:20.548]  Yeah, I mean, that's America.
[00:13:21.781 --> 00:13:23.803]  There's no due process, no control.
[00:13:24.784 --> 00:13:32.852]  He even comes out in a few places in the mainstream newspapers and maybe a few times on CNN, but you're not going to stop them without force.
[00:13:32.952 --> 00:13:34.533]  They're going to keep doing it right out in the open.
[00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:43.602]  No, he's going to sit up there and say, any sex crime, you never need to be let out of prison again.
[00:13:46.377 --> 00:13:48.358]  I can hear him getting all excited talking about it.
[00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:50.140]  He's really something, folks.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.320]  I know how to assess these people.
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.801]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:13:56.183 --> 00:14:06.210]  Did you know that in every state, every week, because I scan the news wires, I see the stories where you pull over on the side of the highway because there isn't a
[00:14:09.127 --> 00:14:10.028]  We're good to go.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.961]  Now, I remember growing up, and you know, you saw cars stopped all over.
[00:14:39.021 --> 00:14:45.544]  No, people know you don't pull over, you don't run behind the tree, or you become a sex offender.
[00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:55.768]  It's absolutely amazing what this country's turned into, and they charge people every day of the week.
[00:14:57.748 --> 00:15:01.430]  Or you're, and there are literally thousands of cases a year of the 18-year-old
[00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:10.852]  Who was 17 and he was dating a 16 year old girlfriend but now he's 18 and they don't care if she's even turned 17.
[00:15:10.892 --> 00:15:14.755]  They find out, they find out, well wait you just turned 17 but you're pregnant.
[00:15:15.195 --> 00:15:26.563]  That means, oh, two months before you turned 17 you got pregnant with your boyfriend who you've been dating for two years and so he's going to go to jail and he's going to have a sex offender listing.
[00:15:27.923 --> 00:15:29.605]  So see that's how it works folks.
[00:15:29.645 --> 00:15:31.666]  You're going to get a sex offender registry.
[00:15:33.931 --> 00:15:37.952]  Your son, your daughters are for things that almost every one of us did.
[00:15:39.312 --> 00:15:44.854]  I mean, I had girlfriends that were out of high school when I was in high school, and I had girlfriends that were a year younger than me.
[00:15:47.654 --> 00:15:51.255]  And you do what everybody, or almost everybody, was involved in.
[00:15:51.275 --> 00:15:54.596]  I'm not saying it's a good thing to be promiscuous.
[00:15:54.616 --> 00:15:56.236]  You get in a lot of trouble and a lot of problems.
[00:15:58.437 --> 00:15:59.617]  And your life's over.
[00:16:00.734 --> 00:16:05.779]  And there's cops and judges all day long who, when they were 18, did the same thing, and they don't care.
[00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:07.480]  They'll lock you up and feel good about it.
[00:16:08.461 --> 00:16:08.862]  Alright?
[00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:17.690]  And they catch you behind that tree, relieving your bladder, you're going to jail, and you're going to be a sex offender.
[00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:26.278]  Now, you want to load Russian children up, three-year-olds, to be taken to be raped by Saudi Arabians,
[00:16:28.792 --> 00:16:32.554]  And to be used up and killed in many cases, there's nothing going to happen to you.
[00:16:34.015 --> 00:16:42.820]  And pieces of trash, like Glenn Black, are going to get up on the air and shoot their mouths off all high and mighty about how we need to lock everybody up.
[00:16:44.581 --> 00:16:45.642]  That's how this works!
[00:16:47.182 --> 00:16:55.027]  And Congressman Foley is going to call for any type of sex crime, life in prison, no parole, while he runs the missing and exploited children,
[00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.892]  Because he's a dirtbag pervert!
[00:17:01.834 --> 00:17:03.395]  And it's Justice Department's own numbers.
[00:17:03.475 --> 00:17:04.696]  I don't like to publicize them.
[00:17:05.337 --> 00:17:10.260]  But the biggest, most dangerous group where you're going to find pedophiles is in two areas.
[00:17:10.941 --> 00:17:13.202]  Truancy officers and CPS workers.
[00:17:13.923 --> 00:17:14.563]  And it's a fact.
[00:17:14.603 --> 00:17:15.664]  Go take criminology.
[00:17:15.964 --> 00:17:17.666]  Go buy a criminology textbook.
[00:17:18.206 --> 00:17:19.107]  It's actually admitted.
[00:17:20.208 --> 00:17:23.210]  I can't believe they admit this stuff, but they know most people don't read this stuff.
[00:17:24.391 --> 00:17:25.912]  And that's who protects our kids.
[00:17:26.966 --> 00:17:35.313]  You see, the totally out-of-their-gourd nutcase-on-drugs pervert goes out and tries to grab your kid out of your front yard.
[00:17:36.154 --> 00:17:44.400]  The smart ones go to school, they get badges and guns, they load children on jets, and they fly them out, folks.
[00:17:44.921 --> 00:17:46.442]  And they have their way with them right here.
[00:17:47.323 --> 00:17:49.905]  And they dig up the little dead bodies with their heads cut off.
[00:17:50.981 --> 00:17:59.904]  That one little case that finally got on CNN with a black girl, CPS, and it turns out the head of CPS, the top three people in Florida, are all convicted child rapists.
[00:18:01.585 --> 00:18:02.925]  And it's just swept under the rug.
[00:18:03.626 --> 00:18:05.386]  Now that's who runs our society.
[00:18:05.406 --> 00:18:10.748]  And if you don't think these people will carry out 9-11, you've got another thing coming.
[00:18:12.869 --> 00:18:18.711]  So I flip over to the next channel, and I listen to Neil Bortz, who calls for me to be put in a FEMA camp.
[00:18:21.408 --> 00:18:33.331]  And he's on there with his idiot collar, all emotional and feeling good, talking about how good George Bush is, and what a big hypocrite Hillary is, and how they only fired seven U.S.
[00:18:33.391 --> 00:18:41.212]  attorneys, and why Hillary fired them all, and the travel office, and everything they did, and how good Gonzales is.
[00:18:41.372 --> 00:18:44.413]  As if it makes what Gonzales is doing okay!
[00:18:46.562 --> 00:18:48.583]  Because Hillary did something far worse.
[00:18:49.143 --> 00:18:51.344]  No, that doesn't make it okay.
[00:18:51.424 --> 00:18:54.285]  It shows you that both sides are on the same side.
[00:18:54.946 --> 00:19:01.409]  And by the way, Hillary and Clinton, Hillary and Bill did the more corrupt but more clean thing.
[00:19:01.589 --> 00:19:03.209]  They just fired everybody right up front.
[00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.430]  They're right.
[00:19:06.093 --> 00:19:06.473]  No.
[00:19:07.234 --> 00:19:21.181]  They're making a distraction with the fact that Hillary did that, instead of looking, and of course she's a hypocrite calling for Gonzalez to resign, and then he can rightfully say, well she's a hypocrite, I'm not going to.
[00:19:22.782 --> 00:19:27.504]  The real meat and potatoes are hidden deeper in the articles, in that U.S.
[00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:34.248]  attorneys were told to prosecute Democrats that were going to win races, and set Democrats up.
[00:19:34.955 --> 00:19:37.779]  To frustrate the electoral process.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.861]  That's the issue.
[00:19:40.482 --> 00:19:44.608]  Instead, we're running around talking about, do they have a right to fire U.S.
[00:19:44.688 --> 00:19:45.188]  attorneys?
[00:19:46.069 --> 00:19:47.051]  They fired U.S.
[00:19:47.131 --> 00:19:49.754]  attorneys that wouldn't engage in crimes.
[00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:51.937]  That's the issue here.
[00:19:52.598 --> 00:19:53.299]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:57.159 --> 00:20:00.042]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:20:00.402 --> 00:20:03.285]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:20:03.505 --> 00:20:09.710]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:20:10.071 --> 00:20:17.397]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.

[00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:57.019]  Gold.
[00:20:57.339 --> 00:20:58.640]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:04.983]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:05.163 --> 00:21:08.985]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:09.325 --> 00:21:11.226]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:11.266 --> 00:21:13.587]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:13.708 --> 00:21:20.391]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and

[00:21:45.314 --> 00:21:46.956]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:46.976 --> 00:21:51.020]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:51.380]  Supreme Court.
[00:22:06.974 --> 00:22:11.257]  Yet on February 29th, 1892, in an I-Nothing decision of the U.S.
[00:22:11.317 --> 00:22:14.919]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:21.202]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[00:22:21.963 --> 00:22:30.267]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:36.271]  Call now.

[00:22:57.091 --> 00:22:59.133]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:59.733 --> 00:23:08.680]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:16.366]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:17.047 --> 00:23:18.848]  But now, it's cancer's turn.
[00:23:20.472 --> 00:23:20.932]  I think so.
[00:23:46.863 --> 00:24:05.550]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:09.091]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:14.073 --> 00:24:26.403]  I mean, I listen to these self-righteous people call into these neocon talk shows, and they talk about how conservative they are, and how good they are, and how good President Bush is.
[00:24:27.123 --> 00:24:39.653]  President Bush admittedly, premeditatedly, has lied to the American people over and over again, and most of the neocon followers deny that, but some of them go, of course he lied, that's how you get things done!
[00:24:42.242 --> 00:24:44.025]  Understand something and understand it good.
[00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:00.730]  Trying to go after the Second Amendment.
[00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:05.251]  Democrats would just get all giddy, and, oh, he's my daddy.
[00:25:05.271 --> 00:25:06.792]  I mean, I heard him on talk shows.
[00:25:06.832 --> 00:25:08.852]  He's like the nation's father.
[00:25:09.672 --> 00:25:11.513]  Oh, I see him as a father figure.
[00:25:11.553 --> 00:25:14.273]  I mean, it's so pathetic, okay?
[00:25:16.034 --> 00:25:16.894]  Do you understand that?
[00:25:16.954 --> 00:25:18.274]  You mean nothing to the elite.
[00:25:18.694 --> 00:25:21.315]  Everything they do is about getting control of you.
[00:25:21.675 --> 00:25:26.956]  Everything they do is about getting you on welfare, in the criminal justice system, or in debt.
[00:25:28.229 --> 00:25:28.589]  Okay?
[00:25:29.089 --> 00:25:34.431]  Everything is about extracting your labor, and that's only in the consolidation phase, which is almost completed.
[00:25:35.011 --> 00:25:42.834]  When the elite's done consolidating all the wealth, that's only a means to an end for mass extermination.
[00:25:44.355 --> 00:25:48.556]  And I know the Austin Chronicle a few weeks ago, I wasn't aware of it, but somebody emailed it to me.
[00:25:48.616 --> 00:25:49.376]  I saw it last night.
[00:25:49.656 --> 00:25:50.977]  Made a big joke about how
[00:25:51.866 --> 00:26:03.653]  How all my cult followers in Austin believe the government wants to kill us and that we're... You know, I'm real sorry, scum, that you don't go to eugenics.org and read the master plan.
[00:26:04.293 --> 00:26:06.775]  I'm real sorry that you're not informed, okay?
[00:26:08.416 --> 00:26:14.759]  I'm real... but, but, government killed over 200 million people in the last century and it was done by design.
[00:26:14.779 --> 00:26:15.460]  200 mil... million...
[00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:24.542]  How many sports stadiums of 100,000 people is that?
[00:26:25.562 --> 00:26:28.444]  How many... In fact, I don't have a calculator in front of me.
[00:26:28.484 --> 00:26:29.525]  John, do you have one up there?
[00:26:31.526 --> 00:26:34.729]  How many times... Let me write it out here, but I have to be silent to do it.
[00:26:34.749 --> 00:26:35.509]  I'm not very good at math.
[00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:39.912]  How many times does 100,000 go into 200 million?
[00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:40.973]  Now, we're rounding it down.
[00:26:41.033 --> 00:26:41.914]  It's conservatively 200 mil.
[00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.753]  Just counting five big mass murder governments.
[00:26:46.133 --> 00:26:49.496]  If you count some of the others, it's around 220 or so, with some more change.
[00:26:49.516 --> 00:26:50.697]  But 200 million divided by 100,000.
[00:26:50.737 --> 00:26:52.799]  How many sports stadiums of 100,000 is that?
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:53.360]  How many?
[00:27:04.722 --> 00:27:06.863]  2,000, yeah, that's what I thought.
[00:27:07.443 --> 00:27:08.003]  Okay.
[00:27:08.023 --> 00:27:13.625]  2,000 sports stadiums of 100,000 people.
[00:27:16.626 --> 00:27:21.727]  I know, pretty soon you're going to say, Stalin and Hitler and Mao didn't do that, but then the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot. 2,000
[00:27:30.002 --> 00:27:37.616]  100,000 capacity football stadiums, overflowing, jammed with men, women, and children.
[00:27:39.204 --> 00:27:52.675]  And the very crew, the grandchildren and the sons and daughters of the people that did that are running China, Germany, Russia, England, the United States, Africa, Latin America.
[00:27:53.196 --> 00:27:59.541]  They run it all and they're saying this time they're going to get at least half of us.
[00:28:01.242 --> 00:28:04.105]  And top professors get up in front of 2,000 person crowds
[00:28:06.418 --> 00:28:17.181]  1,800 person crowds and they get standing 95% standing ovations when they say we need a quote Chinese style police state to implement this.
[00:28:21.242 --> 00:28:30.724]  And Dinecore and Halliburton are in the Chicago Tribune admittedly running giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:28:33.424 --> 00:28:35.665]  Well if that's the case then why are you still alive?
[00:28:36.457 --> 00:28:37.838]  Well, it's a miracle, isn't it?
[00:28:38.018 --> 00:28:41.959]  And it's because they know there's millions of us fighting them and they know it draws attention to things.
[00:28:42.599 --> 00:28:46.461]  But that doesn't mean one day they won't have one of their programmed individuals do something.
[00:28:46.481 --> 00:28:47.961]  It doesn't mean I haven't been physically attacked.
[00:28:48.201 --> 00:28:50.942]  It doesn't mean I haven't been through a lot of stuff you don't even know about, folks.
[00:28:52.463 --> 00:28:58.405]  But it's almost like they don't want to, and it isn't what I want, but they think it's what I want.
[00:28:58.885 --> 00:29:00.206]  I know that's in their assessment.
[00:29:00.486 --> 00:29:01.667]  It's just that I don't care.
[00:29:02.067 --> 00:29:02.767]  I'm committed.
[00:29:06.949 --> 00:29:07.969]  It isn't about me.
[00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:11.390]  It isn't about Alex Jones.
[00:29:13.251 --> 00:29:16.652]  And I have lost a lot not having as big an ego as I once did.
[00:29:16.672 --> 00:29:23.214]  You know, the drive to be dominant, the drive to be number one, the drive to be the really fighting the globalists because I'm tough.
[00:29:24.375 --> 00:29:27.256]  That's all faded away and now it's just single-mindedness.
[00:29:29.336 --> 00:29:31.297]  Now it's just single-minded mission.
[00:29:32.897 --> 00:29:34.678]  I mean, these people are the scum of the earth.
[00:29:35.828 --> 00:29:37.329]  And they need to be brought down to size.
[00:29:37.369 --> 00:29:38.369]  They need to be defeated.
[00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:40.170]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:41.270]  I'll get into all the news.
[00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:43.011]  I'll try to cut the rant off.
[00:29:43.051 --> 00:29:43.771]  Go to your calls.
[00:29:43.791 --> 00:29:44.651]  Got a big guest coming up.
[00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:48.293]  We're on the march.
[00:29:48.753 --> 00:29:50.334]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:50.354 --> 00:29:53.955]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.301 --> 00:30:01.401]  Does this sound bring on a sudden onset of fear?
[00:30:01.842 --> 00:30:03.762]  A fear of not knowing who's on the other end?
[00:30:04.062 --> 00:30:08.503]  Do you avoid picking up the phone knowing it's just going to be another harassing phone call from a debt collector?
[00:30:08.663 --> 00:30:13.124]  Do you resent your daily trips to the mailbox knowing it will be flooded with notices from creditors?
[00:30:13.424 --> 00:30:16.385]  Over 1 million credit card holders will declare bankruptcy this year.
[00:30:16.625 --> 00:30:18.985]  Learn how to legally eliminate your credit card debt.
[00:30:19.145 --> 00:30:19.726]  Want to know more?
[00:30:19.946 --> 00:30:20.166]  Call 920-293-8024.
[00:30:20.206 --> 00:30:20.626]  That's 920-293-8024.
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.501]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:30:30.961 --> 00:30:32.882]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:36.784]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:30:37.404 --> 00:30:43.887]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:31:31.544 --> 00:31:31.804]  I think so.
[00:31:57.003 --> 00:31:57.504]  Hey, Emily.
[00:31:57.844 --> 00:31:58.624]  Wow, you look great.
[00:31:58.925 --> 00:31:59.665]  I feel great.
[00:32:00.126 --> 00:32:01.747]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[00:32:02.308 --> 00:32:02.588]  Really?
[00:32:02.848 --> 00:32:03.288]  What is it?
[00:32:03.469 --> 00:32:03.889]  How does it work?
[00:32:04.169 --> 00:32:10.454]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[00:32:10.775 --> 00:32:12.836]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:32:13.237 --> 00:32:18.701]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:32:18.941 --> 00:32:19.322]  That's it?
[00:32:19.702 --> 00:32:21.223]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:32:21.563 --> 00:32:22.224]  It is easy.
[00:32:22.664 --> 00:32:28.968]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:32:29.208 --> 00:32:30.569]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:32:30.989 --> 00:32:31.650]  That's amazing!
[00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:36.833]  And, the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:32:37.293 --> 00:32:37.573]  Wow!
[00:32:37.854 --> 00:32:38.854]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[00:32:39.094 --> 00:32:41.856]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.

[00:32:48.141 --> 00:32:48.341]  That's 800-317-9547.
[00:33:10.441 --> 00:33:11.022]  Welcome back.
[00:33:38.946 --> 00:33:40.567]  Now, I mean, I have been changing.
[00:33:40.587 --> 00:33:42.148]  You can probably tune in and tell that.
[00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:46.631]  And I've just gotten to the point where I just don't care anymore.
[00:33:48.272 --> 00:33:51.795]  And it's fully hit me just how evil our enemies are.
[00:33:51.875 --> 00:33:54.717]  It's so unbelievable.
[00:33:55.797 --> 00:33:59.900]  The things they do, the things they're involved in, the things they do to innocents.
[00:34:01.061 --> 00:34:07.665]  And then just the unfathomless ignorance of the general public and their willingness
[00:34:08.931 --> 00:34:09.732]  To be conned.
[00:34:10.592 --> 00:34:13.954]  Their willingness to be lied to.
[00:34:14.014 --> 00:34:17.576]  Their willingness to be abused.
[00:34:17.656 --> 00:34:20.818]  They're unbelievable cowardice.
[00:34:22.479 --> 00:34:24.080]  Now I've got all this news in front of me.
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:32.085]  I know we've got Joe and Louis and Joe and Richard and Vincent and many others holding and I'll go to some of your calls.
[00:34:32.185 --> 00:34:34.667]  But we've got Asian markets falling.
[00:34:36.208 --> 00:34:37.789]  We've got the stock market falling.
[00:34:39.534 --> 00:34:47.136]  Here in the United States, every major index, and I don't know if we're going to go into a huge recession right now.
[00:34:47.196 --> 00:34:49.876]  We've never left one for the last, really, 20 years.
[00:34:50.617 --> 00:34:52.417]  They just keep telling you the economy's great.
[00:34:53.417 --> 00:34:54.537]  And let me explain that.
[00:34:54.577 --> 00:34:56.878]  I'm not an economist, but I've interviewed many economists.
[00:34:58.098 --> 00:35:02.619]  George Humphrey's a degreed economist right here in Austin, Texas, but I've interviewed just scores of them.
[00:35:03.139 --> 00:35:05.980]  Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize winner, you heard him a few months ago.
[00:35:07.402 --> 00:35:11.143]  And they said that if things aren't reversed, we're going to have a total global depression.
[00:35:12.484 --> 00:35:15.305]  And then I say, well, are the globalists reversing the policies?
[00:35:15.825 --> 00:35:17.846]  Oh no, they're intensifying them.
[00:35:17.866 --> 00:35:19.186]  They're greasing the skids.
[00:35:19.987 --> 00:35:25.929]  So, I'm not saying what's going to happen, but I don't need to talk to George Humphreys or Joseph Stiglitz.
[00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:36.833]  I don't need to talk to them to be able to go, gee, we've got the highest debt ratio we've had since the Great Depression.
[00:35:37.648 --> 00:35:41.550]  They're mailing credit cards every other day to people that are broke and don't have jobs.
[00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.752]  But they don't send it to you if you've got good credit and pay your debts.
[00:35:47.233 --> 00:35:52.275]  And people are being encouraged that it's normal to have three mortgages on your house.
[00:35:53.576 --> 00:36:07.163]  And almost everybody I knew ten years ago that had jobs as engineers at Dell or Advanced Micro Devices or Motorola has now run lawn companies and their wife works at HEB at the grocery store.
[00:36:09.609 --> 00:36:19.413]  And there's illegal aliens everywhere driving down the wages, and the government's openly talking about total blanket amnesty and unlimited welfare for all these people.
[00:36:20.994 --> 00:36:31.278]  I know that almost every dollar of tax money that you pay never touches any services and goes directly into private banks and private corporations' hands.
[00:36:32.218 --> 00:36:33.679]  Just everything is a lie!
[00:36:33.759 --> 00:36:34.939]  It's all a fraud!
[00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:36.800]  I mean, it's unbelievable!
[00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:52.875]  And I guess what's happened over the years is I tend to get conditioned myself and acclimated to where I see incredible news reports and it doesn't even shock me anymore.
[00:36:55.196 --> 00:37:02.038]  Like the Israeli ambassador found tied up in a courtyard with a red ball in his mouth, naked with a bunch of sex toys around him.
[00:37:02.459 --> 00:37:03.719]  I don't even cover that.
[00:37:04.412 --> 00:37:12.717]  Because that's nothing compared to cancer viruses being put in the vaccines.
[00:37:14.078 --> 00:37:15.099]  It just doesn't even rate.
[00:37:15.899 --> 00:37:23.163]  Or I read where, oh, they're going to make diabetes patients take microchips if they want care at government-funded hospitals.
[00:37:25.265 --> 00:37:28.887]  Or the Mexican Attorney General is going to make all his employees take chips.
[00:37:31.964 --> 00:37:36.947]  Or a hospital's making all the new babies have a chip put in their umbilical cord at birth.
[00:37:37.888 --> 00:37:39.049]  I don't even cover it now!
[00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:47.514]  And I guess it's just kind of, I've been re-unacclimated.
[00:37:48.755 --> 00:37:53.679]  It's just, things are really coming clearly to me, and I just am seeing it for what it is.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:56.941]  And it's amazing!
[00:37:58.061 --> 00:38:00.223]  A caller called yesterday and talked about how
[00:38:03.888 --> 00:38:26.247]  He was talking to his friend's sister in Arizona, and how she got there for 45 minutes, none of the kids were coming out, parents aren't allowed to go into schools, there's barbed wire fences around them, armed guards, you know, the parents are being taught who the boss is, the schools say the kids belong to them when they've got them, the state's letting you know it's the boss, just bullying, and if you buy into it, that's the way it is.
[00:38:27.949 --> 00:38:30.831]  The child comes out and says, free to speak,
[00:38:33.143 --> 00:38:33.783]  Freely, sir.
[00:38:34.663 --> 00:38:35.504]  May I speak freely?
[00:38:36.064 --> 00:38:39.065]  And they're not allowed to talk any part of the day at their lunch.
[00:38:39.605 --> 00:38:44.006]  And I go, oh yeah, I remember seeing a bunch of articles about that, and I didn't even think to cover those.
[00:38:46.607 --> 00:38:48.127]  How they're training them how to be prisoners.
[00:38:50.548 --> 00:38:55.689]  And then knowing that'll sell most of the public on, well, you know, they're out of control, we need discipline.
[00:38:55.909 --> 00:39:00.170]  They did that by design to get things out of control, then they come in with the extreme.
[00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.611]  It's called problem, reaction, solution.
[00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:18.671]  And every day I see the cases here in Austin, around the country, where a neighbor sees some four and five-year-olds playing in a fenced-in backyard.
[00:39:20.531 --> 00:39:22.332]  They're homeschoolers.
[00:39:22.712 --> 00:39:30.433]  They decide that it's illegal for kids to not be in school because they watch the sitcoms and the dramas and the fiction, which then sets the parameters for reality.
[00:39:31.053 --> 00:39:33.774]  And they call the CPS and the parent still doesn't know at the door.
[00:39:34.214 --> 00:39:35.894]  And the CPS says, mind if I come in?
[00:39:36.627 --> 00:39:46.455]  And they see a furball on the ground or dirty dishes, then they come with police, grab your children, and then if you're blessed and fight them for a year, you might get them back.
[00:39:49.757 --> 00:39:51.839]  I mean, I've seen the crimes, folks.
[00:39:52.019 --> 00:39:54.140]  I've witnessed it personally.
[00:39:55.421 --> 00:40:05.249]  I've been in the dirt, down in the trash, as they say, and I just, it's just so alien to me.
[00:40:06.104 --> 00:40:14.051]  It's so alien, and I hear all these simpering fake liberals who just spew whole false paradigms.
[00:40:14.432 --> 00:40:27.804]  They just spew an entire litany of truths and half-truths and zero-truths, and it's just all mixed together, and they run around feeling good about themselves as the all-powerful state grows and grows.
[00:40:27.824 --> 00:40:30.206]  And then I watch the conservatives.
[00:40:30.226 --> 00:40:31.307]  They're not conservatives.
[00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:34.550]  They're just members of a team.
[00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:36.010]  It's like their football team.
[00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:38.011]  No matter what it does, it's okay.
[00:40:46.014 --> 00:40:46.354]  Alright.
[00:40:46.374 --> 00:40:52.397]  I mean, I just get to the point where I spend hours and hours reading the news.
[00:40:53.467 --> 00:40:56.609]  And then I get up here on air, and I just can't even cover it.
[00:40:56.669 --> 00:40:59.310]  I don't even want to look at it after I've already read it two or three times.
[00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.892]  I don't even want to have to analyze how bad it is.
[00:41:01.932 --> 00:41:02.892]  I'm disgusted!
[00:41:03.453 --> 00:41:06.294]  What is the point of even proving how bad it is anymore?
[00:41:07.135 --> 00:41:09.436]  There's almost four trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[00:41:09.756 --> 00:41:12.898]  The Pentagon gets up in front of Congress and says, we're not going to tell you where it is.
[00:41:12.918 --> 00:41:14.078]  It's none of your business.
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:20.002]  The people running the White House are all former Trotskyites.
[00:41:20.082 --> 00:41:22.203]  I mean, you can't make this type of stuff up.
[00:41:23.996 --> 00:41:26.037]  They're openly building FEMA camps everywhere.
[00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:33.460]  National talk show hosts are on the radio every day reading off talking points saying we should all be put in them if we don't agree with the government.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.141]  I'm living in a twilight zone!
[00:41:37.001 --> 00:41:40.223]  How could you not see how crazy it is?
[00:41:43.704 --> 00:41:45.545]  And they've got us so overextended.
[00:41:45.585 --> 00:41:48.926]  They have doubled the money supply in the last six years.
[00:41:48.986 --> 00:41:51.247]  A year ago they announced they're going to double it again in the next two.
[00:41:51.507 --> 00:41:52.968]  Then they made the money supply secret.
[00:41:53.755 --> 00:42:08.598]  Folks, if they don't continue now to expand the money supply, then it will start contracting, and that's what they want, and they're going to contract the money supply, where you won't even be able to get your money out of the bank to pay things, even if you have savings.
[00:42:09.358 --> 00:42:13.119]  Much less if you're in debt, there won't be physical currency to pay it!
[00:42:14.139 --> 00:42:22.101]  I mean, they are setting us up so bad, I just... It's like watching a car on the railroad tracks.
[00:42:23.251 --> 00:42:29.453]  And there's a huge locomotive coming, a speed train, a bullet train, at 150 miles an hour.
[00:42:30.854 --> 00:42:43.339]  And you see the car on the tracks, and you walk over to the people, and they're giggling and laughing, like they're on PCP or something, and you tell them, listen, you need to get out of the car, or you need to start the car, what's wrong with your car, does it not work?
[00:42:43.739 --> 00:42:46.060]  And they just start giggling at you, saying, what car?
[00:42:46.713 --> 00:42:53.978]  And you say, you're in a car, you're on railroad tracks, there's a train three miles away, it's going to be here in a minute and a half, listen to me.
[00:42:55.059 --> 00:43:08.968]  You need to get your car started and you look in the car and it's not just that, you know, it's a gibbering idiot at the wheel who thinks they know everything and they're laughing at you, but you look in the car and there's four children in the car and they don't deserve what's going to happen to them.
[00:43:08.988 --> 00:43:11.370]  Look, these yuppies and liberals and conservatives and
[00:43:11.994 --> 00:43:18.617]  And, and, and, and, and, you know, lawyer, Harley-driving 50-year-olds who think they own the planet and think they're part of the elite.
[00:43:19.118 --> 00:43:21.539]  I'm not saying you're bad if you own a Harley, but you know who I'm talking about.
[00:43:21.559 --> 00:43:27.141]  The know-it-all types who think they're part of the elite are nothing, total trash, weaklings, chicken necks.
[00:43:31.163 --> 00:43:34.265]  They need to be pounded upside the head, basically, you know the type I'm talking about.
[00:43:34.285 --> 00:43:38.267]  And, uh, they, uh,
[00:43:40.965 --> 00:43:41.845]  They're laughing at you.
[00:43:43.005 --> 00:43:44.686]  And here comes the train, man.
[00:43:44.706 --> 00:43:45.527]  You just step back.
[00:43:45.567 --> 00:43:56.031]  How many times have I had to warn people and talk about something and lay it out, and then you just step back and watch the train just smash the car into a million pieces and there's little bodies flying up in the air?
[00:43:57.172 --> 00:43:58.753]  I mean, we told you they'd go in Iraq.
[00:43:58.773 --> 00:44:00.233]  We told you they'd break it in three parts.
[00:44:00.533 --> 00:44:04.115]  We told you they'd fund sectarian violence because that was the official Pentagon plan.
[00:44:10.433 --> 00:44:14.476]  We told you they're going to pump up the mortgages by design and then implode them.
[00:44:15.357 --> 00:44:15.878]  They're doing it.
[00:44:17.859 --> 00:44:21.662]  We told you they'd come out with a new phase of live virus vaccines.
[00:44:22.143 --> 00:44:25.906]  They already had the stuff in the vaccines to begin with, but now they were going to announce it.
[00:44:26.886 --> 00:44:30.810]  It attacks the brain, it does... Folks, that's why most the public can't think.
[00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:34.553]  They took vaccines that had viruses designed to attack the brain.
[00:44:34.573 --> 00:44:37.275]  And it doesn't matter if I've got mainstream news articles about it.
[00:44:38.726 --> 00:44:41.668]  People just hear this show and think I'm talking like a space alien.
[00:44:42.088 --> 00:44:45.691]  We're living in a totally insane world.
[00:44:49.053 --> 00:44:51.134]  You know, I say I'm going to get to the news and I just can't do it.
[00:44:51.494 --> 00:44:52.935]  I've just gotten to the point where I can't do it.
[00:44:54.416 --> 00:44:57.498]  Like, I'm totally torn right now about an article Paul Watson wrote.
[00:45:02.442 --> 00:45:07.525]  And I've been wanting to attack these people, I've been wanting to expose them, I know exactly what they are.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.221]  There's no debating it.
[00:45:10.061 --> 00:45:12.323]  It's as obvious as a bump on a log.
[00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:15.945]  It's just a... There's a nose on your face.
[00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:24.351]  I mean, these people running around saying no planes at Tower 1 or 2.
[00:45:24.692 --> 00:45:26.513]  These people saying space lasers did it.
[00:45:27.153 --> 00:45:31.877]  These people who come out, get cred for about a year, and then they show themselves.
[00:45:32.497 --> 00:45:35.459]  It's pretty obvious, you know, where some of these people worked and where they came from.
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.781]  But then just to have it confirmed,
[00:45:38.514 --> 00:45:50.784]  One of the screw loose change top debunkers has gone public and said that they were told to go to conferences to try to get people to talk about anti-semitism, to try to tie it to holocaust denial.
[00:45:51.865 --> 00:45:53.226]  We know that's a government program.
[00:45:54.587 --> 00:45:59.691]  To try to promote and push certain individuals we know are disinfo operatives.
[00:46:00.812 --> 00:46:02.574]  And now one of them's gone public with it.
[00:46:02.894 --> 00:46:03.915]  I mean, I already knew it.
[00:46:04.435 --> 00:46:06.737]  And I could read this and tell you this is the real deal.
[00:46:08.191 --> 00:46:12.233]  This is one of their own people going, look, you know, I can't be part of this.
[00:46:15.455 --> 00:46:19.897]  Again, it's like folks saying, well, if 9-11 was an inside job, people would go public.
[00:46:20.537 --> 00:46:25.359]  It usually takes 10 years, folks, for people, and then a lot of times they get whacked.
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:32.983]  But this individual says he's going to go public with more, and he said it got scary at the end, and he hopes he's going to be safe and okay.
[00:46:33.971 --> 00:46:38.955]  See, one of these little camp followers found out this is a lot more serious than you thought, wasn't it?
[00:46:39.996 --> 00:46:41.777]  This stuff's real, okay?
[00:46:42.458 --> 00:46:46.581]  I've been in the smoking rooms where they've offered me money to sell out to them.
[00:46:46.841 --> 00:46:48.843]  Folks, this stuff's real, okay?
[00:46:49.163 --> 00:46:49.684]  It's real!
[00:46:49.844 --> 00:46:51.025]  They killed those people!
[00:46:52.066 --> 00:46:53.367]  They'll probably kill me!
[00:46:53.387 --> 00:47:00.372]  I put my family in danger because I love this country and I've got to stand up for other people.
[00:47:01.073 --> 00:47:02.374]  And I pray God protect me.
[00:47:03.928 --> 00:47:08.595]  But this stuff's real, and I want it to burn into your brains just how real it is.
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.882]  Just how serious it is.
[00:47:18.389 --> 00:47:19.671]  Just how scary it is.
[00:47:21.559 --> 00:47:25.522]  Because the people running the world enjoy hurting innocents.
[00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:26.282]  Do you understand that?
[00:47:26.563 --> 00:47:30.485]  They like it that children are getting their arms and legs blown off at landmines.
[00:47:30.866 --> 00:47:34.068]  They like what Saudi Arabia and Israel do in the sex trade.
[00:47:34.428 --> 00:47:36.690]  They like what Malaysia does.
[00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:37.951]  They like it.
[00:47:38.411 --> 00:47:40.913]  They like poisoning you.
[00:47:41.253 --> 00:47:43.515]  They enjoy hurting you.
[00:47:43.535 --> 00:47:46.737]  You know, I learned something.
[00:47:46.757 --> 00:47:47.658]  You learn something every day.
[00:47:49.043 --> 00:47:52.806]  I didn't know that there was a book written called Biometrica.
[00:47:54.447 --> 00:48:00.591]  I didn't know that Biometrics is a school of eugenics.
[00:48:02.192 --> 00:48:13.480]  I didn't know they had all these kooky calculations they made, and that they openly said that people who they didn't want to be part of the elite, that they were going to poison through injections and other things.
[00:48:15.169 --> 00:48:16.610]  Oh, God, I've learned so much.
[00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:18.872]  Just the more I learn, it's horrible.
[00:48:19.753 --> 00:48:22.254]  It's absolutely horrible!
[00:48:23.535 --> 00:48:29.580]  To police, military, anybody listening, I'm begging you, man, find out what I'm saying is true.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:33.063]  I mean, they wrote a book in the 20s called Biometrica.
[00:48:35.144 --> 00:48:37.025]  Oh, man, they've had this planned a while.
[00:48:39.107 --> 00:48:44.191]  And, uh, I just don't know how somebody
[00:48:49.257 --> 00:48:50.097]  We've got to beat them.
[00:48:50.478 --> 00:48:54.281]  They've got a lot of power, a lot of technology, a lot of brainwashed people serving them.
[00:48:55.081 --> 00:48:59.385]  Most of their servants, though, are just scared, and so they deny what we're saying.
[00:48:59.425 --> 00:49:02.727]  They decide to rationalize what their bosses are doing.
[00:49:04.148 --> 00:49:05.850]  But I just can't see this standing.
[00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:07.611]  I can't see them getting away with this.
[00:49:08.191 --> 00:49:11.574]  And for all the evil they've done, it's all just the beginning.
[00:49:11.654 --> 00:49:12.875]  It's just setting the table.
[00:49:15.785 --> 00:49:18.666]  For the last hundred years, they've been setting the table.
[00:49:20.406 --> 00:49:33.729]  And they got the water out, they got the ice tea pitcher, they got the butter and the pepper and the salt and the plates and the knives and the forks and the napkins and the bouquet arrangement.
[00:49:34.009 --> 00:49:39.690]  And now they're starting to bring out the roast and the side dishes.
[00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:41.050]  And it's steaming.
[00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:44.171]  And folks, they're getting their knives and forks in their hands.
[00:49:45.945 --> 00:49:47.585]  That's how close it is, okay?
[00:49:48.706 --> 00:49:56.948]  The 200 million they killed, 2,000, 100,000 person sports stadiums.
[00:49:56.988 --> 00:49:57.708]  Think about that.
[00:49:57.888 --> 00:49:59.089]  Image that in your mind.
[00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:05.410]  2,000 sports stadiums with 100,000 people in each one.
[00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:10.732]  Men, women, children with lives, with people they love, with family histories.
[00:50:11.863 --> 00:50:25.633]  With land they owned, and ideas, and little songs they told their children, little stories that have been passed down from great-grandma, recipes, culture, all destroyed, all to destroy cultures.
[00:50:26.534 --> 00:50:30.697]  The globalists always go into strong, happy areas and they kill everybody.
[00:50:31.417 --> 00:50:39.904]  Well, I want you to know, and I want your servants to know, we're not going to roll over here, and we're not going to go along with you, and we're going to fight you,
[00:50:40.894 --> 00:50:42.016]  And we're going to beat you.
[00:50:43.137 --> 00:50:45.961]  And we're going to try you.
[00:50:46.181 --> 00:50:47.203]  And you're going to pay.
[00:50:47.643 --> 00:50:48.525]  And you're going to pay.
[00:50:48.545 --> 00:50:51.669]  And this time it isn't going to be your puppet Hitler or your puppet Stalin.
[00:50:52.009 --> 00:50:55.875]  It's going to be you, David Rockefeller, and the Rothschilds and all of you.
[00:51:00.254 --> 00:51:05.721]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:06.082 --> 00:51:13.712]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:14.406 --> 00:51:21.471]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:21.851 --> 00:51:33.298]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:33.598 --> 00:51:37.521]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:39.482]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:39.842 --> 00:51:43.685]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:51:56.781 --> 00:52:01.863]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:52:01.923 --> 00:52:09.245]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:52:09.385 --> 00:52:20.008]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:52:20.229 --> 00:52:24.750]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:30.031]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:52:30.251 --> 00:52:33.192]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:33.412 --> 00:52:43.274]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.

[00:52:54.557 --> 00:52:54.797]  Thank you.

[00:53:22.925 --> 00:53:35.218]  Did you know that Herbal Healer offers not only natural medicine, but also tension-relieving herbal teas, cookbooks, aromatherapy, products for pampering, and more great products to help you soothe and relax after a long day.
[00:53:35.678 --> 00:53:36.279]  We're good to go.
[00:54:15.499 --> 00:54:20.840]  All right, let's just go ahead and jam in a bunch of your calls.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:26.721]  We've got a documentary filmmaker who made the big film about bubble warming being a swindle.
[00:54:28.161 --> 00:54:31.122]  Joining us for about 30 minutes, and we're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:54:31.162 --> 00:54:35.503]  Going to play some of those Ron Paul clips from famous speech he gave Neocon that's now resurfaced.
[00:54:36.223 --> 00:54:37.623]  Joe, where are you calling from today?
[00:54:37.963 --> 00:54:38.383]  Wisconsin.
[00:54:38.803 --> 00:54:39.123]  Hello.
[00:54:39.783 --> 00:54:42.144]  And just in case it wasn't covered,
[00:54:44.071 --> 00:54:50.973]  There is no safety in shadows, but the Sanhedrin is going to reinstitute Passover sacrifices.
[00:54:51.033 --> 00:54:52.293]  I got that out of Heratz.
[00:54:52.953 --> 00:55:01.775]  Now, I can go into detail about what that exactly means, but I would use it as a talking point to go to your neighbors and talk to them.
[00:55:02.475 --> 00:55:04.576]  Talk to your neighbors.
[00:55:05.296 --> 00:55:09.797]  Don't talk to your neighbors about how the Federal Reserve is private or any of that.
[00:55:09.817 --> 00:55:11.197]  Talk to them about the Sanhedrin.
[00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:14.151]  Well, no, it's about the Passover sacrifices.
[00:55:15.131 --> 00:55:30.098]  Basically what it means is that God, when he said, I'm going to stop the Israelites from making their annual ritual sacrifice, it was meant more as a symbology for Jesus himself.
[00:55:30.738 --> 00:55:35.500]  And once he made his sacrifice, once Jesus was sacrificed,
[00:55:36.058 --> 00:55:38.020]  That was the perfect atonement.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:41.963]  And now the Israelites are trying to go back to that system.
[00:55:42.024 --> 00:55:49.971]  They're trying to say, no, this meant nothing, and God will see that as the ultimate abomination.
[00:55:50.932 --> 00:55:54.234]  They haven't been having it because they haven't had their temple.
[00:55:54.634 --> 00:55:55.334]  Right.
[00:55:55.714 --> 00:55:58.376]  So they're not doing it from a Christian perspective.
[00:55:58.836 --> 00:55:58.976]  No.
[00:55:59.216 --> 00:56:01.617]  But I understand what you're saying.
[00:56:01.897 --> 00:56:04.919]  They have gotten a hold of the Ark of the Covenant.
[00:56:05.059 --> 00:56:08.020]  They have found a red heifer.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.681]  They've gotten the ashes of the old sacrifice.
[00:56:11.522 --> 00:56:13.263]  And they're going to re-institute this.
[00:56:13.863 --> 00:56:16.584]  Now, politely, talk to your neighbors.
[00:56:16.744 --> 00:56:20.166]  I've spoken to people... Go tell your neighbors about red heifers?
[00:56:21.158 --> 00:56:26.121]  I mean, look, I know all about this stuff, and I understand the New Temple, end of the world type stuff.
[00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:27.202]  I understand all that.
[00:56:27.682 --> 00:56:29.483]  But I would approach your neighbors, frankly.
[00:56:29.503 --> 00:56:31.224]  I mean, they're not going to know.
[00:56:31.684 --> 00:56:36.227]  Maybe in the fourth or fifth conversation you have with them, I'd get into Sanhedrin and red heifers.
[00:56:36.687 --> 00:56:39.829]  Well, just say that Jesus is the perfect sacrifice.
[00:56:40.509 --> 00:56:41.870]  Just start from that point.
[00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:48.414]  But I've talked to... But there's no debate that religious, orthodox Jews aren't Christians.
[00:56:49.201 --> 00:56:56.124]  Well, obvious, but you can talk to them about why are you sacrificing, and most of them will say, well, we just have to.
[00:56:56.224 --> 00:56:58.225]  And it's like, no, what's the purpose behind it?
[00:56:58.445 --> 00:56:59.145]  I understand.
[00:56:59.545 --> 00:57:00.966]  Listen, I really appreciate your call.
[00:57:02.867 --> 00:57:04.327]  I really do.
[00:57:05.968 --> 00:57:07.168]  I just wonder, what do you say?
[00:57:07.188 --> 00:57:13.711]  I mean, what do you say about spotless heifers?
[00:57:16.012 --> 00:57:17.153]  I mean, it's illegal to
[00:57:18.934 --> 00:57:24.078]  Talk about Jesus to say the name Jesus on the streets of Jerusalem or anywhere in Israel.
[00:57:24.839 --> 00:57:26.720]  You're not allowed to hand out tracts.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:28.242]  You're not allowed to have churches.
[00:57:28.722 --> 00:57:29.142]  Nothing!
[00:57:30.563 --> 00:57:37.709]  And so Pastor Hagee gets up on TV and says that Jews in Israel don't have to come to Christ and they're better than anybody.
[00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:41.913]  He said that at the AIPAC meeting.
[00:57:42.233 --> 00:57:43.194]  What do you expect?
[00:57:45.355 --> 00:57:47.437]  What do you expect from this devil government?
[00:57:48.171 --> 00:57:50.132]  That's exactly what the Bible says will happen!
[00:57:52.834 --> 00:57:54.995]  I mean, it's UNBELIEVABLE!
[00:57:56.596 --> 00:58:02.600]  I mean, you want to approach somebody to talk to them about Israel, talk to them about that!
[00:58:04.181 --> 00:58:08.283]  Are laws in Israel against a Jew marrying anybody but a Jew?
[00:58:08.863 --> 00:58:13.006]  They're the only country in the world that has race marriage laws!
[00:58:15.227 --> 00:58:16.228]  Why is that okay?
[00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:18.271]  Why is that good?
[00:58:20.933 --> 00:58:27.278]  Why is that acceptable with these pulpit prostitutes like Pastor Hagee?
[00:58:27.298 --> 00:58:31.021]  I mean, it's just disgusting!
[00:58:31.682 --> 00:58:33.984]  Don't worry, you're going to get your leader soon enough.
[00:58:34.024 --> 00:58:35.986]  He'll rise and they're going to worship him.
[00:58:37.527 --> 00:58:41.750]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7644.
[00:58:53.406 --> 00:58:54.047]  Big Brother.
[00:58:54.707 --> 00:58:55.768]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:56.489 --> 00:58:57.589]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:59.051]  You want answers?
[00:58:59.831 --> 00:59:00.812]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:01.392 --> 00:59:05.035]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:05.576 --> 00:59:09.639]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:29.471 --> 00:59:40.339]  Alright, we're scheduled coming up in the next segment to get the producer, television director on, Martin Durkin, who made this great film about the fraud of global warming.
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:42.361]  That is man-made global warming.
[00:59:43.182 --> 00:59:44.283]  Hope you'll stay with us for that.
[00:59:44.343 --> 00:59:47.145]  Right now, let's go to more callers.
[00:59:47.365 --> 00:59:48.466]  Who's up next here in line?
[00:59:50.183 --> 00:59:51.163]  Lewis in New Jersey.
[00:59:51.183 --> 00:59:51.703]  You're on the air.
[00:59:51.763 --> 00:59:52.144]  Go ahead.
[00:59:53.024 --> 00:59:53.824]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:59:54.784 --> 00:59:55.505]  Thanks for having me.
[00:59:55.565 --> 00:59:56.425]  Yes, thanks for calling.
[00:59:56.445 --> 00:59:57.065]  What's on your mind?
[00:59:57.725 --> 00:59:58.185]  Two things.
[00:59:58.866 --> 01:00:05.948]  I wanted to get your take on an individual I met who claims he's an Irish-American, claims his sovereignty, pays no taxes.
[01:00:05.968 --> 01:00:07.328]  I wanted to get your take on that.
[01:00:08.248 --> 01:00:15.090]  And also, I recently discovered the law of attraction by watching a movie called The Secret.
[01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:17.991]  And I wanted to just
[01:00:18.587 --> 01:00:19.868]  You know, get your take on that as well.
[01:00:20.788 --> 01:00:24.110]  Basically, it says that... That's that stuff Oprah Winfrey pushes, right?
[01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:27.611]  Well, I believe it was on her show at one time, yes.
[01:00:28.371 --> 01:00:31.313]  But I came to it through a different channel.
[01:00:31.393 --> 01:00:34.074]  I understand, where you visualize something and it happens?
[01:00:34.834 --> 01:00:42.638]  Well, it talks about more so the being focused on what it is you want to bring into your life or into
[01:00:43.523 --> 01:01:09.990]  uh... this world and i feel that uh... that ties into what's going on in that there are people who are aware of that law will surely let me comment on that in a minute but about what was your first question the first was about uh... you know it dot people who uh... when they like really it's specific to uh... those who might because african-american who uh... claim sovereignty based on connection to tribes et cetera
[01:01:11.931 --> 01:01:23.696]  Well, you have Native Americans who are able to do that, but the government just gets them under greater control and puts corrupt tribal leaders over them has been the strategy.
[01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:28.854]  But I mean, there's lots of groups that claim sovereignty and claim they're outside the scope of the state.
[01:01:29.234 --> 01:01:41.490]  The problem is the state is totally rogue, so whether those arguments are legitimate or not doesn't matter, because they'll just send armed goons out who just like to kill people to enforce it.
[01:01:42.176 --> 01:01:45.279]  Okay, well my more important point was the Law of Attraction.
[01:01:45.319 --> 01:01:47.141]  I really did want to get your feedback on that.
[01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:47.661]  Sure, sure.
[01:01:47.721 --> 01:01:48.562]  Law of Attraction.
[01:01:48.582 --> 01:01:49.883]  You know, I haven't read that.
[01:01:49.903 --> 01:01:50.724]  I haven't seen that.
[01:01:50.784 --> 01:01:53.727]  I mean, I've certainly heard the same idea.
[01:01:53.747 --> 01:01:58.031]  I mean, the extreme form of it would just be magical thinking.
[01:01:58.962 --> 01:01:59.482]  I think so.
[01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:25.222]  And it's about training themselves to stay in that heightened state of combat action, really survival mode longer.
[01:02:26.202 --> 01:02:33.146]  Then with the mind, now certainly if you're confident in believing something, and you're not too confident, you may come off like a nut if you're not.
[01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:35.347]  Yeah, you're going to have better luck with women.
[01:02:35.367 --> 01:02:37.369]  You're going to have better luck in business.
[01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:39.210]  It's called confidence.
[01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:45.173]  But at the same time, you just get a bunch of cult-like, you know, you can go to the extreme of that.
[01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:56.401]  But the globalists are masters of just telling you resistance is futile, you can't fight City Hall, there's nothing you can do, they're invincible, there's nothing we can do.
[01:02:57.422 --> 01:03:06.231]  Certainly, it is a big part of the equation that if you believe something, it's going to basically control what ends up happening.
[01:03:06.731 --> 01:03:07.331]  And so, no.
[01:03:07.391 --> 01:03:08.252]  We're going to win.
[01:03:08.312 --> 01:03:09.192]  We don't have a choice.
[01:03:09.492 --> 01:03:10.813]  We're going to beat the New World Order.
[01:03:10.933 --> 01:03:12.833]  We do have to see that in our mind's eye.
[01:03:13.213 --> 01:03:14.374]  We do have to believe that.
[01:03:14.614 --> 01:03:16.154]  But then put it into action.
[01:03:16.695 --> 01:03:17.075]  You see?
[01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:19.576]  Because you have to believe something and want something.
[01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:21.516]  And then you've got to put it into action.
[01:03:21.556 --> 01:03:23.057]  And then that's the other half of the equation.
[01:03:26.209 --> 01:03:27.310]  Do you see what I'm saying, sir?
[01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:28.510]  Yes, I do.
[01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:30.231]  I really appreciate your feedback on that.
[01:03:30.251 --> 01:03:32.292]  I've been applying it for about a week so far.
[01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:33.493]  It's really been working for me.
[01:03:33.773 --> 01:03:36.054]  And I would encourage everyone to check it out.
[01:03:36.074 --> 01:03:41.457]  I don't know if you'd let me plug the site that the movie's on, but if not, at least just do a search on the web.
[01:03:41.477 --> 01:03:41.957]  Yeah, you plug it.
[01:03:41.977 --> 01:03:42.277]  You've got time.
[01:03:42.297 --> 01:03:43.158]  You've got five seconds.
[01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:44.478]  TheSecret.tv.
[01:03:44.818 --> 01:03:45.739]  And go check it out.
[01:03:45.839 --> 01:03:46.999]  It's gotten massive hype.
[01:03:47.019 --> 01:03:47.840]  Everybody knows about it.
[01:03:52.248 --> 01:03:55.433]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:55.753 --> 01:03:57.696]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:58.057 --> 01:04:05.708]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:06.388 --> 01:04:13.431]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:13.831 --> 01:04:25.256]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:25.576 --> 01:04:29.518]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:29.538 --> 01:04:31.459]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:31.799 --> 01:04:35.661]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.823]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:04:52.863 --> 01:04:53.384]  are located?
[01:04:53.584 --> 01:04:56.967]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:04:57.187 --> 01:05:01.911]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:05:02.191 --> 01:05:07.195]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[01:05:07.315 --> 01:05:08.035]  We're good to go.
[01:05:26.747 --> 01:05:27.027]  I think so.
[01:05:48.553 --> 01:05:53.334]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:05:53.554 --> 01:05:57.535]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:05:57.796 --> 01:06:04.097]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:06:04.337 --> 01:06:08.718]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.

[01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:55.431]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.634 --> 01:07:16.739]  We're scheduled, this happens half the time when it's overseas, to have Martin Durkin on.
[01:07:16.779 --> 01:07:24.384]  I was all hot to get him on last week after I saw his documentary, The Global Warming, The Great Swindle, but he's not answering.
[01:07:24.424 --> 01:07:28.567]  That's fine, I don't even... Frankly, I wanted to move on from that subject and get into a bunch of other news.
[01:07:29.168 --> 01:07:30.649]  I know we got a bunch of callers holding.
[01:07:30.669 --> 01:07:34.992]  Let's go to your calls and I'm going to get into the news here in just a few minutes because there's a bunch of stuff I want to get to.
[01:07:36.593 --> 01:07:37.894]  Joe in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:40.024]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[01:07:40.184 --> 01:07:42.306]  I'm a long-time listener and first-time caller.
[01:07:42.446 --> 01:07:44.308]  Oh my God, thanks for putting up with me.
[01:07:44.828 --> 01:07:45.869]  Hey, no problem, man.
[01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:54.396]  I wanted to call and let you know about this kind of a smoking gun that I found regarding the Catholic Church's sex abuse cover-up.
[01:07:55.898 --> 01:08:05.106]  It's a document called Criminalis Solicitationis, and it was written in 1962 and sent out to every bishop in the world
[01:08:05.811 --> 01:08:14.577]  It's basically a policy paper on what exactly the bishops and priests are supposed to do if one of their priests gets accused of molesting a child.
[01:08:14.637 --> 01:08:20.041]  I mean, it says specifically that they are not allowed to go to the police.
[01:08:20.161 --> 01:08:22.003]  They are to do an internal investigation.
[01:08:22.943 --> 01:08:27.186]  It provides that they should create a secret archive file and seal them forever.
[01:08:28.007 --> 01:08:35.312]  And the capper is that if any priest breaks the secret, they are automatically by their admitting
[01:08:35.717 --> 01:08:44.081]  That this document exists, or that this other priest they know of molested a child, then they're automatically excommunicated.
[01:08:44.622 --> 01:08:49.664]  And for anybody who is not Catholic, excommunication in the eyes of the Church means damnation.
[01:08:49.844 --> 01:08:52.866]  Now, do they admit the authenticity of this document?
[01:08:54.206 --> 01:08:55.827]  I have found it online.
[01:08:56.027 --> 01:08:58.969]  The Guardian Unlimited wrote a story about it.
[01:08:59.489 --> 01:09:00.289]  The byline is August 17, 2003.
[01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.510]  Wow!
[01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:01.090]  What's the headline?
[01:09:06.464 --> 01:09:09.588]  Vatican told bishops to cover up for sex abuse.
[01:09:12.111 --> 01:09:12.672]  To cover up?
[01:09:13.730 --> 01:09:16.752]  They provide a PDF document.
[01:09:16.792 --> 01:09:17.633]  It's a 39-page document.
[01:09:17.693 --> 01:09:18.694]  That's unbelievable.
[01:09:18.794 --> 01:09:19.814]  Well, that just shows it.
[01:09:19.994 --> 01:09:23.297]  I mean, listen, that's who runs the planet, not just the Catholic Church.
[01:09:23.957 --> 01:09:31.722]  And when you find that out, it's like, what happened to our species that a pervert guild runs everything?
[01:09:31.742 --> 01:09:37.526]  I mean, look at Bush and Jeff Gannon and all the stuff with Bush Sr.
[01:09:37.566 --> 01:09:39.248]  and it just keeps coming up in the news.
[01:09:43.574 --> 01:09:45.736]  The way the Vatican works, the Vatican is very famous.
[01:09:45.756 --> 01:10:00.828]  I was raised Catholic and I was actually abused by a couple of priests when I was growing up and I just recently, you know, in the course of my, I recently came to a settlement against the church and in the course of the investigation, that's where I came across that document.
[01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:06.272]  But, you know, I know that the Vatican works incredibly slowly.
[01:10:06.593 --> 01:10:10.716]  They take 40, sometimes 50 years to come to a decision
[01:10:11.383 --> 01:10:12.644]  To write something like that.
[01:10:12.764 --> 01:10:20.089]  So, I mean, if that thing was written in 1962, that means that they were getting reports at the turn of the century, at least.
[01:10:20.489 --> 01:10:25.853]  And it is my personal belief that they had been molesting children for at least a thousand years.
[01:10:27.554 --> 01:10:28.154]  No kidding.
[01:10:28.174 --> 01:10:29.155]  I mean, come on.
[01:10:29.175 --> 01:10:31.336]  I mean, what do you expect?
[01:10:31.356 --> 01:10:32.497]  You get a course.
[01:10:33.037 --> 01:10:36.860]  Yeah, they were, you know, priests were not always celibates.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.141]  They were forced into celibacy in about 1100 A.D.
[01:10:40.734 --> 01:10:41.356]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:10:50.276 --> 01:11:02.526]  I guess I called because it was sort of in response to when you had Hutton Gibson on saying that, you know, it was like all the priests who are pedophiles or they're all homosexuals and this has been only going on since 1969 or something like that.
[01:11:03.007 --> 01:11:11.774]  There's a lot of people, conservative Catholics, who try to pin the sex abuse on the licentious 60s and the 70s and the whole sexual revolution.
[01:11:11.874 --> 01:11:14.737]  Well, I think there's no doubt that it's only gotten worse.
[01:11:15.347 --> 01:11:16.088]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:11:16.228 --> 01:11:20.471]  I mean, in fact, I do agree with Hutton when he says there's an evil sickness afflicting the church.
[01:11:20.531 --> 01:11:23.433]  I mean, it's like, wow, I don't like him, but I agree with that.
[01:11:23.513 --> 01:11:23.874]  My God.
[01:11:24.594 --> 01:11:27.216]  But I think he's got a lot of his facts wrong.
[01:11:27.396 --> 01:11:27.657]  Okay.
[01:11:27.997 --> 01:11:29.298]  Well, you're on air right now, sir.
[01:11:30.118 --> 01:11:30.439]  Thank you.
[01:11:31.419 --> 01:11:32.460]  I appreciate your call.
[01:11:33.381 --> 01:11:36.964]  Let me... The problem is, callers bring up so many issues.
[01:11:36.984 --> 01:11:43.569]  There's like ten things I want to comment on, and by the time I end the call, or they end the call, and I forget the points I wanted to make,
[01:11:44.895 --> 01:11:49.537]  But, oh yeah, it's here in my stack.
[01:11:51.818 --> 01:11:52.659]  You know in the U.S.
[01:11:52.699 --> 01:11:55.560]  they want children as young as six, and they have done this.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.181]  They just don't care what the parents want.
[01:11:58.962 --> 01:12:03.824]  Heather has two mommies, and Adam and Steve, and all this stuff.
[01:12:05.104 --> 01:12:10.827]  And then they set it up where you're just backwards, you're just a homophobe, you don't want this taught.
[01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:17.974]  Children that are six years old don't need to be taught anything about sex, period.
[01:12:20.575 --> 01:12:23.197]  I mean, there's your pervertedness right there.
[01:12:23.957 --> 01:12:27.760]  And it's true that these people don't breed, so they recruit.
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:36.685]  And I've got it out of what the London Guardian yesterday, there have been several articles in England, where they want it by law to be taught to four-year-olds
[01:12:37.808 --> 01:12:45.354]  And it's the fairy tales about the two kings, the two queens, about three bisexual penguins that adopt a baby.
[01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:47.435]  Yeah, you mean the CPS a baby.
[01:12:49.417 --> 01:12:50.738]  So they don't want to talk about that, too.
[01:12:50.778 --> 01:13:00.966]  They have their sex crime guild, the CPS, grab the healthy baby, and then a few hundred thousand paid by the wealthy
[01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:18.779]  You don't want to talk about the crimes you commit against heterosexuals, or how you're predatory, or how you have the lowest life expectancy, even with AIDS taken out of the equation, of anybody in this society.
[01:13:19.537 --> 01:13:21.038]  I don't hate homosexuals.
[01:13:21.158 --> 01:13:22.838]  I don't hate the gay community.
[01:13:23.218 --> 01:13:24.679]  I'm not against those people.
[01:13:24.739 --> 01:13:29.740]  I'm just telling you that there's bad stuff in your whole movement.
[01:13:30.181 --> 01:13:31.501]  You don't live very long.
[01:13:32.421 --> 01:13:36.282]  And it just goes from bad to worse the deeper you get into this stuff.
[01:13:37.023 --> 01:13:40.064]  And a bunch of your leaders are pedophiles.
[01:13:41.324 --> 01:13:42.324]  Now, that's evil.
[01:13:43.105 --> 01:13:43.825]  And that's wrong.
[01:13:45.525 --> 01:13:49.828]  And there's no denying it's going on, there's no denying it's happening, and I'm sick of it!
[01:13:53.770 --> 01:14:00.414]  I mean, nobody better in school, and of course my children get private tutors by that.
[01:14:00.454 --> 01:14:04.456]  They go to a swim lesson, they go to a music lesson, they go to an English lesson.
[01:14:04.476 --> 01:14:11.540]  That's basically how they're homeschooled, but they're also sent out into group settings for learning.
[01:14:12.933 --> 01:14:21.895]  But, I'm gonna sue you, and I'm gonna bullhorn your house, and I'm going to come after you if anybody talks to my small children about sex.
[01:14:23.855 --> 01:14:25.236]  Number one, they're too young.
[01:14:25.256 --> 01:14:27.996]  Number two, that's not your business, you perverts!
[01:14:30.217 --> 01:14:32.917]  I don't care if you're pushing heterosexual or homosexual stuff.
[01:14:33.857 --> 01:14:35.798]  By the way, you'll be lucky if I just sue you.
[01:14:37.798 --> 01:14:38.478]  You'll be lucky.
[01:14:39.958 --> 01:14:42.439]  I've gotten to the point where I can't control myself.
[01:14:43.041 --> 01:14:44.442]  Frankly, I'll come break your neck.
[01:14:45.743 --> 01:14:46.804]  You really want to know the truth.
[01:14:46.824 --> 01:14:48.766]  I mean, I've gotten to that point.
[01:14:48.786 --> 01:14:51.868]  I used to have control of myself.
[01:14:51.948 --> 01:14:58.594]  I would not even imagine that I would let myself, because I know what I'm capable of.
[01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:01.356]  But just at this point, I have just had enough.
[01:15:01.376 --> 01:15:02.117]  Do you understand?
[01:15:02.377 --> 01:15:05.600]  I've had enough of all this evil, all of this garbage!
[01:15:08.202 --> 01:15:09.223]  I'm sick of it!
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:36.237]  I remember about six, seven years ago I read Associated Press articles out of Massachusetts and other places where they took the 10, 11, 12 year olds to quote a field trip at the college and didn't tell the parents what it was and they taught the children how to do things I can't even mention on air and then the government defended it and said that's sex curriculum.
[01:15:41.321 --> 01:15:42.442]  I mean that's the incredible thing.
[01:15:43.426 --> 01:15:49.948]  You pull over on the highway and run behind a tree to relieve your bladder, you're going to get a sex crime charge and on your record.
[01:15:50.428 --> 01:15:56.569]  But they can have teachers sit there and teach 11-year-olds.
[01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:07.212]  They took them to a dormitory and they had them in beds, teaching them how to put someone's arm somewhere.
[01:16:07.612 --> 01:16:08.593]  That was one of the things.
[01:16:08.693 --> 01:16:10.033]  I can't mention the other stuff.
[01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:14.197]  And nobody gets arrested, nobody gets in trouble.
[01:16:14.997 --> 01:16:21.099]  Because you have to understand, it's the people in the system that are the hardcore abusers.
[01:16:25.901 --> 01:16:31.963]  And then they're just busy out there grabbing 18 year olds that have got 16 or 17 year old girlfriends.
[01:16:34.964 --> 01:16:38.825]  Or they're even going after 18 year old girls that got 16 year old, 17 year old boyfriends.
[01:16:39.926 --> 01:16:40.446]  Or people that
[01:16:43.271 --> 01:16:53.779]  urinated behind a tree, or somebody who was surfing the internet and downloaded something that the government says might be somebody who's 16.
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:17:01.044]  But you want to load jets up full of children, some of which are going to have their heads blown off after they're raped!
[01:17:03.546 --> 01:17:10.591]  And your Italian national television, you run a story about how the Russian and Israeli mob in the US are involved in it, you get fired!
[01:17:13.678 --> 01:17:15.719]  I mean, that's who we're talking about here, folks.
[01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:20.541]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[01:17:21.022 --> 01:17:29.746]  People that see you like a box of Wheaties, or a stick of bubblegum, or a stack of baloney.
[01:17:31.967 --> 01:17:33.267]  You mean nothing to them.
[01:17:33.307 --> 01:17:34.368]  You are nothing to them.
[01:17:38.035 --> 01:17:45.800]  I remember learning that it was Boys Town that they reportedly took children out of to rape and kill in Northern California and other areas and then now it's all come out.
[01:17:47.301 --> 01:17:49.103]  Later it's been confirmed that was going on there.
[01:17:50.844 --> 01:17:51.384]  The raping.
[01:17:53.886 --> 01:17:55.127]  The flying them all over.
[01:17:56.007 --> 01:17:57.569]  I mean, that's who runs things, folks!
[01:17:58.089 --> 01:18:03.072]  You gotta have dirt on people of that caliber to have them be involved in carrying out 9-11 attacks.
[01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:06.680]  To have them involved in doing all this stuff.
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.201]  These are people that get off.
[01:18:08.421 --> 01:18:23.304]  They're so wicked and so degenerate and so fallen that to get a thrill, they've got to walk around in white lab coats, you know, in big projects and have deadly, deadly pathogens put into your shots.
[01:18:23.964 --> 01:18:24.864]  And they enjoy it.
[01:18:24.904 --> 01:18:26.724]  They go home at night and rub their hands together.
[01:18:27.885 --> 01:18:29.385]  You understand how evil they are?
[01:18:33.306 --> 01:18:33.966]  God help us.
[01:18:34.046 --> 01:18:34.686]  I mean, it's just...
[01:18:36.798 --> 01:18:48.221]  When you realize how serious this is, I just... Richard, Vincent and others, your calls are coming up and I will cover a bunch of news.
[01:18:50.642 --> 01:18:51.682]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:18:52.002 --> 01:18:54.783]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:59.204]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:18:59.644 --> 01:19:00.465]  So what do you do?
[01:19:00.785 --> 01:19:05.346]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:19:05.846 --> 01:19:07.968]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:19:08.448 --> 01:19:23.160]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:30.266]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:19:38.530 --> 01:19:40.131]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:19:55.709 --> 01:20:00.532]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:00.733 --> 01:20:03.474]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:03.515 --> 01:20:04.635]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:05.976 --> 01:20:10.579]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:18.765]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:20:19.766 --> 01:20:22.828]  Midas Resources is offering the red buck and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[01:20:24.958 --> 01:20:28.441]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[01:20:34.186 --> 01:20:40.031]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:20:40.612 --> 01:20:40.792]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:40.812 --> 01:20:41.112]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:49.201 --> 01:20:51.543]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:20:51.783 --> 01:20:53.805]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:20:53.965 --> 01:21:01.112]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:21:01.292 --> 01:21:09.920]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:14.804]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:21:14.804 --> 01:21:15.004]  Absolutely!
[01:21:15.024 --> 01:21:21.673]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients, is earth-friendly, and completely environmentally safe.
[01:21:21.873 --> 01:21:26.218]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[01:21:26.238 --> 01:21:26.839]  Save up to

[01:21:33.347 --> 01:21:36.171]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:21:49.389 --> 01:21:51.811]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:21:52.311 --> 01:21:55.634]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:21:56.014 --> 01:21:58.956]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:21:59.237 --> 01:22:05.622]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:22:05.682 --> 01:22:10.085]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:22:10.305 --> 01:22:14.687]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:22:14.828 --> 01:22:17.449]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:22:17.469 --> 01:22:20.230]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:22:20.711 --> 01:22:23.232]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:22:23.292 --> 01:22:27.534]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:22:27.594 --> 01:22:28.435]  Treasury bonds.
[01:22:28.715 --> 01:22:33.338]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:22:33.518 --> 01:22:35.160]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:37.161]  That's 1-8888-XANADU or 1-8888-XANADU and ask for George.
[01:22:55.149 --> 01:23:04.814]  Later, I'm going to read part of an email, if I can dig it out of this huge stack, where an individual is like, how dare you say that we're not hurting the earth?
[01:23:04.874 --> 01:23:06.835]  How dare you say humans have no impact?
[01:23:07.475 --> 01:23:09.576]  How dare you say there's no global warming?
[01:23:11.137 --> 01:23:14.699]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not saying genetic engineering isn't causing major problems.
[01:23:14.739 --> 01:23:18.681]  I'm not saying dumping toxic waste in rivers and lakes isn't killing fish.
[01:23:18.801 --> 01:23:20.882]  I'm not saying dioxins aren't
[01:23:22.162 --> 01:23:26.903]  Sterilizing our male population and causing increases in breast cancer.
[01:23:27.603 --> 01:23:30.203]  I'm not saying there isn't a million problems, okay?
[01:23:30.223 --> 01:23:32.264]  I'm not saying there isn't climate change.
[01:23:32.764 --> 01:23:38.865]  I've just interviewed the climatologist and the Nobel Prize winners and the experts, and it is not unanimous like you hear.
[01:23:40.065 --> 01:23:45.146]  Every major institution I've talked to, all the top experts say it's a complete fraud.
[01:23:45.426 --> 01:23:46.666]  The earth is heating up.
[01:23:47.346 --> 01:23:50.167]  It's because the sun is heating up and because of different types of
[01:23:51.045 --> 01:24:13.645]  Particles out of space causing clouds, the biomass of all the bacteria and plankton and the dirt and the oceans, creates many, many times, depending on which calculation you look at, more, quote, greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, than all human activity does, volcanoes, it goes on and on.
[01:24:14.463 --> 01:24:16.624]  Plants absorb more carbon dioxide.
[01:24:16.664 --> 01:24:18.185]  They like more carbon dioxide.
[01:24:18.425 --> 01:24:19.886]  They then create more oxygen.
[01:24:19.906 --> 01:24:23.427]  You get a more oxygen-rich environment that's good for all animal life.
[01:24:24.068 --> 01:24:25.148]  I'm just going to shut up, though.
[01:24:25.188 --> 01:24:26.069]  We've got our guest.
[01:24:26.349 --> 01:24:33.873]  For some reason, the GCN Network could not dial out on any European number or English number, and so we've got our guest.
[01:24:33.933 --> 01:24:38.515]  He's Martin Durkin, television director, with quite a bio.
[01:24:38.575 --> 01:24:42.937]  I've got a link to it up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:44.605 --> 01:25:02.473]  And we're going to get into a lot of other things he's done here today, but I really, just in the interest of time, we'll just skip ahead and talk about the new film he's made that's sent shockwaves across the world, The Great Global Warming Swindle.
[01:25:02.934 --> 01:25:06.615]  And I've seen it on Google Video, and we've played a few little short clips of it here.
[01:25:07.036 --> 01:25:08.256]  Thank you for joining us today.
[01:25:08.276 --> 01:25:09.757]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:25:10.930 --> 01:25:22.411]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and why you decided to make this film, and then let's just run through the catalog of lies and half-truths and this swindle that is man-made global warming.
[01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:31.797]  Well, I've been making science documentaries for an awful long time, for about 20 years or so, and various other documentaries too.
[01:25:32.118 --> 01:25:40.585]  But there's a sort of little kind of science producer community, the World Congress of Science Producers, and we all sort of gather together there once a year and discuss what's what.
[01:25:41.566 --> 01:25:47.611]  And the topic came up really, why no proper science documentary had been done about global warming.
[01:25:47.631 --> 01:25:49.933]  The sort of news and current affairs people had covered it and so on.
[01:25:50.453 --> 01:25:57.498]  But apart from a documentary about 11 years ago that came out and said that it was all a rot, nothing had been done.
[01:25:58.578 --> 01:26:02.641]  And so Channel 4 decided to make a film on this subject and asked me to do it.
[01:26:03.461 --> 01:26:04.322]  So that's how it came about.
[01:26:07.302 --> 01:26:11.906]  Run through the 90 minute film, I mean some of the basic tenets of the film.
[01:26:13.928 --> 01:26:16.731]  The basic story is really quite simple.
[01:26:17.652 --> 01:26:25.459]  We ask why it is that we suppose that carbon dioxide is making all this, is warming the earth.
[01:26:26.099 --> 01:26:43.657]  Um, and so we look back into the Earth's temperature record, um, and that's where Mr. Gore's film, uh, uh, uh, features a little bit, because Mr. Gore says that the sort of central plank to his argument is that there are ice core surveys, and that's where they drill deep into, um, um, um, ice in the poles.
[01:26:43.997 --> 01:26:57.801]  To look back into Earth's climate history, what they do is they can tell from the core, they release the gases that's trapped in the ice, and so they can tell how much carbon dioxide there is, and then by sort of measuring other aspects of the ice, they can tell what the temperature was.
[01:26:58.302 --> 01:27:02.063]  So you can do a temperature and carbon dioxide comparison.
[01:27:03.003 --> 01:27:08.845]  And Al Gore says, there you go, there's a big correlation between temperature and CO2 levels.
[01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:34.368]  But what he didn't say, and obviously the implication was that CO2 has been causing temperature change all along, but what he didn't say was that in all the ice core surveys, and there have been now a number of them, the temperature rises and then a few hundred years later the CO2 levels rise, and then temperatures fall, and then a few hundred years later, between 500 and 1,000 years... Then you interviewed the top experts who study the Antarctic,
[01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:38.175]  You interviewed the top experts who study the North Pole.
[01:27:38.615 --> 01:27:44.861]  You interviewed people from totally different fields, and their data is all meshing together.
[01:27:45.822 --> 01:27:56.131]  But we know it's the sun, and we know it's space that is the main engine of heating and cooling on this planet, and you just can't seem to be able to explain that to the
[01:27:56.912 --> 01:28:01.116]  This new religion, and it is a religion, of man-made global warming.
[01:28:01.516 --> 01:28:03.478]  The CO2 story just doesn't stack up.
[01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:05.340]  I mean, it just doesn't stack up.
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:11.025]  The CO2 has never driven the climate in the past, and there's no evidence to suppose that it's driving climate now.
[01:28:11.845 --> 01:28:17.130]  The correlations between the temperature in the 20th century and CO2 just don't exist.
[01:28:17.290 --> 01:28:21.114]  They do briefly for a couple of decades, but otherwise it doesn't make sense.
[01:28:21.614 --> 01:28:34.299]  And the postwar economic boom, which I don't know how old you are, Alex, whether you remember that, but, you know, when, you know, America especially started producing all the fridges and cars and, you know, modern industrial... Things actually cool, which is... Sure, stay there.
[01:28:34.319 --> 01:28:34.799]  We got a break.
[01:28:34.819 --> 01:28:36.940]  Let's talk about it on the other side.
[01:28:39.401 --> 01:28:40.321]  We're on the march.
[01:28:40.781 --> 01:28:42.402]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:43.302 --> 01:28:45.983]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:49.901 --> 01:28:51.702]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:28:51.782 --> 01:28:53.023]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:28:53.263 --> 01:28:56.085]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:28:56.445 --> 01:28:59.207]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:28:59.747 --> 01:29:06.472]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:29:48.826 --> 01:29:53.792]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:29:54.092 --> 01:29:55.994]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[01:29:56.174 --> 01:29:59.218]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:29:59.398 --> 01:30:02.541]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:30:02.842 --> 01:30:04.704]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:30:04.964 --> 01:30:08.665]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:30:08.945 --> 01:30:11.606]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[01:30:12.226 --> 01:30:16.508]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[01:30:16.728 --> 01:30:20.969]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:30:21.409 --> 01:30:25.752]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[01:30:26.052 --> 01:30:30.314]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[01:30:30.634 --> 01:30:36.518]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[01:30:36.818 --> 01:30:39.259]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[01:30:39.459 --> 01:30:40.280]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:41.640]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[01:30:49.679 --> 01:30:56.843]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two book set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[01:30:57.223 --> 01:31:03.606]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[01:31:04.086 --> 01:31:13.990]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:17.932]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[01:31:18.232 --> 01:31:20.914]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[01:31:21.554 --> 01:31:24.236]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[01:31:24.797 --> 01:31:26.738]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.
[01:31:26.758 --> 01:31:27.458]  Box 969 Soquel, S-O-Q-U-E-L, California 95073.
[01:31:27.759 --> 01:31:31.501]  $32 to Radio Liberty Box 969 Soquel, California 95073 or call 1-800-544-8927.
[01:31:31.521 --> 01:31:31.581]  1-800-544-8927.
[01:32:03.916 --> 01:32:04.717]  Welcome back!
[01:32:05.597 --> 01:32:08.680]  We will get to your calls at the end of this hour, end of the third hour.
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:18.868]  I'm going to play clips of Ron Paul's speech, Congressman, now officially announced for President, on the neocons, a speech we've talked about so much in the past that we now actually have.
[01:32:19.689 --> 01:32:28.756]  Also, science is threatened for climate denial, this out of the Sunny Telegraph, and major newspapers like the Boston Herald have said
[01:32:29.970 --> 01:32:37.113]  That it's like Holocaust denial, there's talk in Europe of passing laws that you're not allowed.
[01:32:37.133 --> 01:32:39.154]  I mean, that's like locking Galileo up.
[01:32:40.615 --> 01:32:42.036]  Here's the bottom line, folks.
[01:32:43.456 --> 01:32:49.779]  Even if you believe in man-made global warming, and the UN's own report that came out a few months ago says humans account for 6%, okay?
[01:32:52.785 --> 01:32:55.748]  But the sun and volcanoes and everything else is the rest of it.
[01:32:56.449 --> 01:33:12.566]  Even if you believe that, their solution of a global tax to be handed over to these international bureaucrats, and then it's being lobbied for, by the way, by big corporations who want that corporate welfare, contrary to mainline propaganda, it's big money pushing for this.
[01:33:13.027 --> 01:33:14.669]  Big foundations pushing for this.
[01:33:15.963 --> 01:33:20.586]  It's just mind-blowing, and now, scientists threatened for climate denial.
[01:33:21.147 --> 01:33:27.511]  Scientists question mankind's impact on climate change, have received death threats, and claim to have been shunned by the scientific community.
[01:33:28.771 --> 01:33:40.559]  They say the debate on global warming has been hijacked by a powerful alliance of politicians, scientists, and environmentalists who have stifled all questioning about the true environmental impact of carbon dioxide emissions.
[01:33:42.817 --> 01:33:49.989]  I've got friends who I've talked to who are smart people and they just go, are you denying that our cars are bad?
[01:33:50.009 --> 01:33:52.853]  Are you denying that it's destroying the earth?
[01:33:53.535 --> 01:33:56.660]  And I'll listen to them about fluoride being used to crack the
[01:33:57.438 --> 01:34:00.279]  Molecules, and that's toxic waste.
[01:34:00.359 --> 01:34:23.385]  I'm not arguing in the dirty industry, but to say that it's causing global warming is... and then the outright childlike frauds of showing polar bears floating on pieces of ice in August, when I'm not an aficionado or a buff, but I've probably read ten different books to my children on polar bears,
[01:34:24.827 --> 01:34:25.608]  From the library.
[01:34:25.648 --> 01:34:26.168]  They love them.
[01:34:26.248 --> 01:34:28.570]  I've probably watched five, six shows over the years.
[01:34:29.011 --> 01:34:31.633]  And they talk about how a polar bear may swim 300 miles.
[01:34:31.913 --> 01:34:33.735]  They routinely swim 100 miles a day.
[01:34:33.995 --> 01:34:38.599]  They get on ice floats to hunt seal and beluga and even walrus.
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:43.904]  But they just... and it admitted that the numbers of polar bears are up.
[01:34:44.564 --> 01:34:47.087]  Polar bears don't get stranded and can't swim.
[01:34:47.427 --> 01:34:50.410]  But it's a simple image of a polar bear
[01:34:51.369 --> 01:35:02.396]  Al Gore shows the ice cliffs falling and says, oh my God, well, why is there an airplane in Greenland that's from World War II 44 feet under ice?
[01:35:03.277 --> 01:35:11.782]  Because there's just billions of tons of new precipitation every year and the glaciers push out to the edge and they're getting thicker!
[01:35:12.691 --> 01:35:17.355]  Glaciers have always been cracking and falling off into the ocean.
[01:35:18.416 --> 01:35:19.137]  I've got him on.
[01:35:19.177 --> 01:35:19.958]  He's the expert.
[01:35:19.998 --> 01:35:24.222]  It's just so frustrating to deal with this.
[01:35:24.262 --> 01:35:29.086]  Director Martin Durkin, the great global warming swindle.
[01:35:29.106 --> 01:35:30.968]  We have a link up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:31.981 --> 01:35:32.982]  It's on Google Video.
[01:35:33.002 --> 01:35:34.483]  I haven't really asked him if that's okay.
[01:35:34.523 --> 01:35:35.224]  We didn't post it.
[01:35:35.244 --> 01:35:38.586]  We're just linked to where it is posted and people are going crazy over it.
[01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:42.028]  But again, I'm going to shut up, sir.
[01:35:42.048 --> 01:35:49.634]  Can you run through just where Al Gore lies, where he misrepresents, and just go over that for folks?
[01:35:50.595 --> 01:35:59.422]  Well, I think that one big image in Al Gore's film is saying that there's a big connection between CO2 and temperature in Earth's temperature history.
[01:36:00.583 --> 01:36:03.626]  But what he doesn't say is that the link is the wrong way around.
[01:36:03.966 --> 01:36:09.931]  The temperature rises and then much later, CO2 rises, and then the temperature falls, and then much later the CO2 level falls.
[01:36:09.971 --> 01:36:10.792]  And that's because
[01:36:11.594 --> 01:36:12.235]  I don't
[01:36:27.336 --> 01:36:30.157]  Uh, memory, is what scientists call it, of temperature changes.
[01:36:30.557 --> 01:36:36.720]  And so when temperature changes, for some other reason, slowly the oceans warm up, and then you get more atmospheric CO2.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.803]  But he doesn't mention that, and so the implication is, from his film, that CO2 has always been a climate driver, and that's patently not true.
[01:36:43.823 --> 01:36:48.705]  And it's simple, you've got all this plankton, all this plant life... And they like it when it's warm.
[01:36:49.856 --> 01:36:50.176]  Pardon me?
[01:36:50.497 --> 01:36:51.558]  And they like it when it's warm.
[01:36:51.698 --> 01:36:56.482]  They like it when it's warm, and you get more life across the board, more animal life.
[01:36:56.802 --> 01:37:03.328]  So the fish, the whales, the animal plankton, they all put out more carbon dioxide.
[01:37:03.768 --> 01:37:05.370]  It's just, it's simple.
[01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:06.110]  How can they not?
[01:37:06.591 --> 01:37:07.792]  How does this fraud work?
[01:37:09.079 --> 01:37:14.564]  I mean, it is quite extraordinary, but it's not the only problem in Mr. Gore's film.
[01:37:14.644 --> 01:37:20.930]  He also talks about malaria and all sorts of other issues in a very dodgy way, and no one seems to have criticized it.
[01:37:20.970 --> 01:37:25.635]  I mean, he said that Nairobi was founded where it was because it was malaria-free.
[01:37:25.995 --> 01:37:27.957]  Nairobi was a malaria pit.
[01:37:28.557 --> 01:37:29.178]  I don't know.
[01:37:44.648 --> 01:37:48.471]  Well, there was a hurricane in, what, 1900 that hit Galveston and killed 14,000 people?
[01:38:09.045 --> 01:38:14.969]  I mean, we went to interview your magnificent hurricane people down in Florida.
[01:38:15.010 --> 01:38:24.798]  In fact, we couldn't fit it into the program, but it was quite clear from what they're saying that it's simply not true that there's any correlation between global temperatures and hurricane activity.
[01:38:25.098 --> 01:38:30.122]  In fact, according to another very good climatologist, an American climatologist,
[01:38:31.763 --> 01:38:43.793]  Dick Linden, as he describes in the program, in theory, if the Earth warms, you ought to get less of that, because the main thing that causes storms is the difference between the temperature in the tropics and the temperature at the poles.
[01:38:43.854 --> 01:38:45.675]  It's the hot and cold, yeah.
[01:38:46.836 --> 01:38:52.461]  So it's full of scientific inaccuracies, Mr. Goresfilm, but everyone's critical faculty seems to have been suspended.
[01:38:52.481 --> 01:38:53.041]  I don't know why.
[01:38:53.261 --> 01:38:57.465]  Well, I mean, they have hurricanes, they call them typhoons in the Pacific,
[01:38:58.132 --> 01:39:18.060]  that get up to two hundred and seventy five miles an hour and so they say it's a new more powerful hurricane uh... the you know that gets up to a hundred and seventy that's not true there were there were ships i happen to have read quite a few naval history books that we're getting two hundred mile an hour readings a hundred and fifty years ago in the caribbean
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:19.541]  And this has been going on for ages.
[01:39:19.581 --> 01:39:27.670]  We had a very good, entertaining BBC documentary, a big documentary in 1974 that we repeated, which was saying, you know, look at all these strange weather events.
[01:39:28.291 --> 01:39:29.172]  There must be something wrong.
[01:39:29.192 --> 01:39:30.533]  We're going to enter another ice age.
[01:39:30.653 --> 01:39:33.016]  There was a big global cooling scare in the 70s.
[01:39:34.827 --> 01:39:37.548]  Now, what about the people who are really behind this?
[01:39:37.588 --> 01:39:41.290]  I mean, we know that the Communists want Communism.
[01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:43.751]  They believe that's good, so they pose as environmentalists.
[01:39:43.771 --> 01:39:44.591]  They're watermelons.
[01:39:44.951 --> 01:39:46.552]  Green on the outside, red on the inside.
[01:39:46.592 --> 01:39:48.273]  Go to any real environmentalist meeting.
[01:39:49.537 --> 01:39:52.938]  I mean, they'll openly tell you, though, they're going to take your farm and ranch and they're going to move on to it.
[01:39:52.978 --> 01:39:54.559]  I've actually seen it in Austin.
[01:39:54.579 --> 01:39:55.219]  They're pigs.
[01:39:56.179 --> 01:40:05.122]  Now, they've got a lot of well-meaning people that follow them and really think they're trying to save the earth, but the Nature Conservancy and Sierra Club are the biggest landowners in this country.
[01:40:05.623 --> 01:40:11.845]  They grab the land, get restrictions on it, then grab it, then they build hotels on it five years later when you forget.
[01:40:12.425 --> 01:40:16.626]  What about the push for this global tax and why the UN and others want this?
[01:40:16.686 --> 01:40:18.227]  I mean, did you hear my point that
[01:40:19.042 --> 01:40:32.225]  Let's say global warming is caused by humans, which of course we know it isn't, then what does their solution do, making India and China and 160 other third world nations exempt from the global carbon tax?
[01:40:33.725 --> 01:40:37.466]  No, I mean, it's kind of getting to the point of madness now, I think.
[01:40:37.566 --> 01:40:48.289]  I mean, I think the basic power of it comes because a large section of kind of middle class intelligence here that's a bit soft left, a bit soft green, you know, they've got this
[01:40:48.829 --> 01:40:50.050]  We're good to go.
[01:41:06.039 --> 01:41:22.061]  Um, so I think that's why, and people wear it as a political badge, I've noticed that arguing with people, you'd have thought in a reasonable world, if you said to people, look, the science is back up, we're not in trouble, you'd simply pat you on the back and say, oh, thanks a lot, that's such a relief, but they're really annoyed.
[01:41:22.614 --> 01:41:29.597]  Because it's rather like... I mean, Europeans, obviously, they hate Bush, the Europeans.
[01:41:29.737 --> 01:41:32.538]  It's the dumb thing in polite society to hate Bush, for some reason.
[01:41:33.298 --> 01:41:34.599]  And global warming is the same.
[01:41:35.339 --> 01:41:42.462]  To fit in with the kind of new social etiquette that they've got, you've got to hate Bush, and you've got to believe in man-made global warming.
[01:41:43.024 --> 01:41:48.866]  What about Mr. Brown, a conservative, saying we need a new world order, global government?
[01:41:48.886 --> 01:41:50.047]  This should be the organizing
[01:42:03.232 --> 01:42:09.216]  Once they've got the disaster scenario on their side, they can use it to do anything really, because once you say the world's going to end otherwise,
[01:42:31.268 --> 01:42:34.510]  It's a really useful way to deny people ordinary liberties.
[01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:36.011]  And it's getting horrid over here.
[01:42:36.451 --> 01:42:46.977]  Where I live, the local council now has the right to go through your rubbish, and if you've thrown out a bit of cardboard, because you've got to separate out everything now, they can fine you £1,000.
[01:42:47.017 --> 01:42:47.137]  That's $2,000.
[01:42:49.518 --> 01:42:52.880]  Just for putting a bottle in the black bag instead of cardboard or whatever.
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:43:04.567]  What about the fella on the coastline there in England who had a little garden and some sand blew on it so he shoveled it back onto the beach and they're talking about a £50,000 fine and six months in prison.
[01:43:05.048 --> 01:43:15.494]  There was a marvellous cartoon on the front of one of the newspapers this morning in Britain had a couple of prisoners dangling from the ankles in some dank prison and one of them is saying to the other, I left my TV on standby.
[01:43:17.899 --> 01:43:33.032]  Well, I mean, I've got a new article that's here in the stack being reported that they're going to do home inspections now in England to make sure you've got the new light bulbs, but then there's a big report out that the light bulbs have to be left on and that the light bulbs are much more toxic.
[01:43:33.953 --> 01:43:36.035]  I mean, it is ridiculous.
[01:43:36.155 --> 01:43:38.717]  It is getting absolutely ridiculous.
[01:43:39.008 --> 01:43:39.349]  I don't think so.
[01:43:56.664 --> 01:43:59.125]  But see, it's ritualized.
[01:43:59.485 --> 01:44:03.766]  They train you to do it over and over again, and then it habitualizes it.
[01:44:04.106 --> 01:44:11.388]  Everything social engineers do is to habitualize, and then that way you're trained in the values of it.
[01:44:12.248 --> 01:44:19.310]  And the difficulty is, as well, politicians, a lot of politicians, you know, think this is just rubbish, but no one dares
[01:44:19.992 --> 01:44:20.432]  I think so.
[01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:33.691]  I'm very influential in the media.
[01:44:33.812 --> 01:44:35.513]  I mean, they're more or less the people who run the media.
[01:44:35.553 --> 01:44:38.816]  But it's not just the useful idiot liberals who want this.
[01:44:39.617 --> 01:44:47.865]  There's a lot of big institutions that want this tax to be served up to the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the United Nations.
[01:44:47.885 --> 01:44:49.687]  Look, here's two articles today about it.
[01:44:49.707 --> 01:44:50.608]  I want your take on these.
[01:44:51.788 --> 01:44:56.674]  The British government makes climate change laws that can never be changed or rescinded.
[01:44:57.114 --> 01:45:07.305]  Environmental groups will be able to take future governments to court if they fail to live up to one promise to cut Britain's carbon emissions under a climate bill published today.
[01:45:07.325 --> 01:45:09.347]  Here's another one, the one I mentioned.
[01:45:09.707 --> 01:45:10.929]  This is UK Daily Mail.
[01:45:11.249 --> 01:45:13.872]  Government eco-snoopers to inspect homes.
[01:45:14.412 --> 01:45:22.885]  Homeowners who refuse to make their properties energy efficient will face financial penalties under drastic government plans to transform Britain into the world's first green economy.
[01:45:22.905 --> 01:45:24.787]  It's just neo-feudalism.
[01:45:24.807 --> 01:45:26.169]  Of course, Prince Philip's for it.
[01:45:27.291 --> 01:45:30.656]  Can you comment on what they're pushing here and on Prince Philip?
[01:45:31.898 --> 01:45:35.161]  Well, I mean, it's kind of bordering on fascism, all of this.
[01:45:36.021 --> 01:45:45.269]  And I think it's no accident that the Nazis actually, too, happen to be terribly into kind of environmental stuff, because there's a sort of
[01:45:45.851 --> 01:45:46.091]  Well, it's
[01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:14.206]  I mean, one chum of his is a guy called Laurence van der Post, who, you know, was very keen on preserving what they describe as, you know, a traditional tribal life in Africa.
[01:46:14.446 --> 01:46:19.109]  One big thing is that we're imposing industry and change on Africa.
[01:46:19.229 --> 01:46:23.091]  I mean, if you go to Africa, they, you know, they're desperate to modernize.
[01:46:23.111 --> 01:46:32.217]  The idea that they just love living in the dirt or something is an awful idea, but that's part of this kind of philosophy that somehow tribal life is more glorious and noble
[01:46:32.899 --> 01:46:33.160]  Thank you.
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:46.063]  Like, gobbling around in the dirt and surviving without electricity.
[01:46:46.083 --> 01:46:51.528]  They're happy to wax lyrical about non-industrial society, but they didn't go for it themselves.
[01:46:51.548 --> 01:46:52.729]  It's the good old days for them.
[01:47:04.139 --> 01:47:05.980]  So you agree this is a neo-feudalism?
[01:47:06.381 --> 01:47:07.041]  Oh, completely.
[01:47:07.061 --> 01:47:15.407]  I mean, Prince Charles has created a little old-fashioned village out in the countryside in England, saying this is a model village, this is how it should be.
[01:47:15.447 --> 01:47:25.455]  I mean, you can see why he pines for a world gone by, because in the olden days kings had genuine power here, and so no wonder he looks at the past with those coloured spectacles.
[01:47:25.855 --> 01:47:30.679]  But personally speaking, my ancestors were, you know, boggy peasants in Ireland.
[01:47:30.719 --> 01:47:32.340]  I have a different view of the past.
[01:47:33.744 --> 01:47:34.465]  Absolutely.
[01:47:34.525 --> 01:47:36.927]  It's a control freak's dream, isn't it?
[01:47:38.948 --> 01:47:41.370]  I honestly think it's frightening.
[01:47:41.450 --> 01:47:52.960]  And when the articles that you mentioned, you know, trying to even transcend democratic powers to overturn laws, you know, they would have it beyond our powers to change.
[01:47:53.696 --> 01:48:04.445]  Well, this allows a select few to set all the governing principles of society and have it unchallenged where they are the grand arbiters of the entire environment.
[01:48:04.505 --> 01:48:05.426]  It is feudalism!
[01:48:06.144 --> 01:48:23.812]  I mean, even if the whole stuff were true, even if man-made global warming by CO2 were true, and I can recommend you look at the, well, you suspect the theory anyway, but I mean, the thing is tosh, but even if it weren't, that is not the way to go about running a society.
[01:48:25.733 --> 01:48:32.476]  Well, I agree, but I mean, even the UN's own report, like I said, that came out a few weeks ago, says humans are 6% of it,
[01:48:34.498 --> 01:48:37.039]  I mean, even their real documents admit we're not doing it.
[01:48:37.079 --> 01:48:44.642]  They just take data that shows it isn't true and just say, look, it shows it, knowing the public's not going to go read scientific papers.
[01:48:45.402 --> 01:48:51.324]  I mean, a lot of the IPCC stuff is just, you know, extraordinarily dodgy.
[01:48:51.364 --> 01:49:01.708]  And as we point out in the program, actually, there's an excellent letter to the Wall Street Journal by a former head of the American Association of Sciences, I think Professor Frederick Seitz,
[01:49:02.308 --> 01:49:13.831]  Noting that in their summary, in their big summary, the IPCC, which they reveal to the press and the politicians, they delete lots of awkward comments that they don't really like too much from their reports.
[01:49:14.031 --> 01:49:19.293]  You know, it's not just what the scientists say, and they always claim that their reports are what all these scientists think.
[01:49:19.513 --> 01:49:24.094]  The scientists are not asked to agree at all, there's no vote taken.
[01:49:24.254 --> 01:49:26.975]  So they kind of claim a consensus which doesn't exist.
[01:49:27.215 --> 01:49:29.996]  That's right, listen, you're the director, you made the film,
[01:49:30.968 --> 01:49:38.870]  Martin Durkin, the great global warming swindle, and hopefully it'll be available soon on DVD in the U.S., and when it is available, I want to have you back on.
[01:49:39.190 --> 01:49:40.511]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[01:49:40.851 --> 01:49:41.451]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:49:42.051 --> 01:49:43.071]  God bless and take care.
[01:49:43.732 --> 01:49:48.093]  All right, I'm going to come back, tell you some of the news that's coming up, then we'll take your calls, then we'll get into the news.
[01:49:52.452 --> 01:49:57.942]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:49:58.303 --> 01:50:05.896]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:06.644 --> 01:50:13.688]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:14.088 --> 01:50:25.534]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:25.814 --> 01:50:29.757]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:29.777 --> 01:50:31.718]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:32.058 --> 01:50:35.900]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:53:06.397 --> 01:53:09.178]  Just pure corporate hype all at once.
[01:53:09.698 --> 01:53:11.378]  The whole society is shifting over.
[01:53:11.398 --> 01:53:13.379]  The government is going to inspect your houses.
[01:53:13.439 --> 01:53:14.639]  It's going to regulate you.
[01:53:14.939 --> 01:53:16.800]  You're going to go to prison for petty things.
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:18.280]  Here's Business Week.
[01:53:18.701 --> 01:53:27.443]  The talk of TED, the California Conference of Entrepreneurs, Scientists, Celebrities, and Politicians highlights the environment, Rwanda, and war photos, among other topics.
[01:53:27.903 --> 01:53:30.924]  Going green is the largest economic opportunity of the 21st century.
[01:53:32.569 --> 01:53:34.050]  And it goes into all the money they're going to make.
[01:53:34.090 --> 01:53:39.414]  Well yeah, all the sweetheart corporations that are involved in... Let me tell you what the environmental movement is.
[01:53:39.454 --> 01:53:52.723]  It's a crying ranching family who's had property for 150 years crying as police come and force them off of it and they give them two cents on the dollar and then five years later they take all the restrictions off and build luxury hotels.
[01:53:53.143 --> 01:53:53.823]  I've seen it!
[01:53:54.264 --> 01:53:56.405]  I don't have to travel outside Austin to see it.
[01:53:57.146 --> 01:53:58.807]  I've had the crying
[01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:04.172]  Good old boys in their cowboy hats in here with their wife out in the hall crying.
[01:54:05.533 --> 01:54:07.814]  They're taking my land in two days, help me Alex.
[01:54:08.215 --> 01:54:08.955]  I can't help them.
[01:54:09.196 --> 01:54:11.878]  There's all these pot-bellied little liberals who love it.
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:18.142]  I'm just, I just get madder and madder and madder and madder.
[01:54:18.162 --> 01:54:20.504]  I'm tired of people being abused and shoved around.
[01:54:20.864 --> 01:54:27.890]  It has absolutely nothing to do, nothing to do with global warming.
[01:54:27.970 --> 01:54:29.391]  Yes, there's global warming.
[01:54:31.738 --> 01:54:35.900]  Thank God there's global warming or we'd be going into another ice age right now.
[01:54:37.861 --> 01:54:39.242]  And that's what the ice cores show.
[01:54:42.564 --> 01:54:47.086]  So thank God for global warming.
[01:54:48.067 --> 01:54:49.948]  I don't even feel like going over the evidence anymore.
[01:54:52.023 --> 01:54:55.684]  We just need to get aggressive, and we need to get aggressive about 9-11.
[01:54:55.784 --> 01:54:59.004]  We need to get aggressive about the electronic voting machines and the fraud.
[01:54:59.024 --> 01:55:01.545]  We need to get aggressive about getting out of this war.
[01:55:06.246 --> 01:55:08.526]  Got a new film, American Blackout, we're carrying.
[01:55:08.586 --> 01:55:09.526]  It's an excellent film.
[01:55:10.487 --> 01:55:13.867]  Hollywood Reporter called it a powerful explanation of voting rights in America.
[01:55:14.287 --> 01:55:16.048]  We're carrying 9-11 Press for Truth.
[01:55:17.348 --> 01:55:18.028]  Excellent film.
[01:55:19.181 --> 01:55:21.642]  It's with the Jersey Girls' Widows.
[01:55:21.722 --> 01:55:22.402]  Very important.
[01:55:22.442 --> 01:55:23.082]  Very well done.
[01:55:23.622 --> 01:55:24.383]  Aftermath.
[01:55:24.843 --> 01:55:27.324]  Unanswered Questions from 9-11 by Guerrilla News Network.
[01:55:27.984 --> 01:55:29.044]  Excellent documentary.
[01:55:30.645 --> 01:55:31.645]  Iraq for Sale.
[01:55:31.685 --> 01:55:32.925]  The War Profiteers.
[01:55:32.986 --> 01:55:34.166]  I think it's the best of these.
[01:55:34.846 --> 01:55:36.887]  Who's Getting Killed and Who's Making a Killing.
[01:55:36.907 --> 01:55:39.228]  It's by Robert Greenwald that put out Outfox.
[01:55:39.848 --> 01:55:41.868]  You can get all these for $18 smackers.
[01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:43.509]  Or you can get them for
[01:55:44.648 --> 01:55:47.391]  What is it, as low as like twelve bucks a piece when you get them together?
[01:55:47.431 --> 01:55:49.453]  We got a bunch of different deals up there on the site.
[01:55:50.113 --> 01:55:53.376]  I know you can get like thirty-something percent off on these when you get them together.
[01:55:54.978 --> 01:56:00.843]  So I hope that you'll visit InfoWars.com, the secure online video and bookstore shopping cart.
[01:56:02.005 --> 01:56:07.610]  My new film, Terror Storm, is the best government-sponsored terror film out there, bar none.
[01:56:08.872 --> 01:56:11.034]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:56:11.134 --> 01:56:14.497]  It carries 7-7 in London, Madrid, in Spain, 9-11.
[01:56:14.917 --> 01:56:15.597]  It covers it all.
[01:56:17.439 --> 01:56:20.581]  And then it gets into war propaganda and how they're heating up for Iran.
[01:56:20.621 --> 01:56:22.183]  And it's got 68 minutes of extras.
[01:56:22.243 --> 01:56:24.184]  It's over three hours on one DVD.
[01:56:24.785 --> 01:56:29.328]  You can get it as low as $9.95 when you get it with American Freedom from Fascism.
[01:56:29.368 --> 01:56:30.469]  We got a bunch of specials.
[01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:34.993]  American Dictators showing how the elections are staged, a film I made.
[01:56:35.493 --> 01:56:37.775]  You can get it for $5.95 as part of package deals.
[01:56:39.139 --> 01:56:40.660]  And yes, this is how you support us.
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:45.423]  And yes, we can do a lot more and have a much greater effect if you will support us.
[01:56:45.463 --> 01:56:46.403]  And we don't have a choice.
[01:56:46.463 --> 01:56:49.105]  Things don't look good and things are bad, but at least we're fighting.

[01:57:04.774 --> 01:57:05.474]  Resell them.
[01:57:05.574 --> 01:57:06.155]  I don't care.
[01:57:06.575 --> 01:57:07.635]  Get the material out.
[01:57:07.695 --> 01:57:08.395]  Get my film.
[01:57:08.736 --> 01:57:09.576]  Make copies of it.

[01:57:35.204 --> 01:57:36.085]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:36.105 --> 01:57:38.487]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:40.689 --> 01:57:42.350]  You want answers?
[01:57:42.570 --> 01:57:45.532]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:57.043]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:57.563 --> 01:58:01.686]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:03.187 --> 01:58:05.869]  Already into hour number three of transmission.
[01:58:05.889 --> 01:58:07.390]  We'll get to your calls now.
[01:58:07.490 --> 01:58:08.671]  Always enjoy your calls.
[01:58:08.691 --> 01:58:14.055]  Now I'm going to play a few clips of Ron Paul's famous neocon speech that we've uncovered.
[01:58:14.915 --> 01:58:18.197]  We read the text of this on air almost four years ago, but now we have it.
[01:58:19.078 --> 01:58:21.680]  I can't air the whole thing today, but we'll air part two tomorrow.
[01:58:23.744 --> 01:58:28.186]  And I have covered quite a bit of the news, but I've got a big gamut of other important news I want to run through.
[01:58:28.666 --> 01:58:30.927]  Right now, let's talk to Richard in Texas.
[01:58:30.967 --> 01:58:31.988]  You're on the air, Richard.
[01:58:32.588 --> 01:58:33.248]  Hello, Alex.
[01:58:33.968 --> 01:58:35.569]  Just a couple of quick comments.
[01:58:35.949 --> 01:58:49.395]  One, with regard to global warming and the issues with the sun and all of that, there's a guy who I'm sure you've seen on Jeff Rents' site, and he's got this website, Thunderbolts of the Gods, I think it's called, and he talks about a complete
[01:58:50.155 --> 01:58:53.458]  There's a lot of people saying a lot of things.
[01:58:53.478 --> 01:58:55.459]  I don't listen to all the info the scientists bring forward.
[01:58:55.479 --> 01:58:57.501]  I don't listen to all the other alternative stuff.
[01:59:16.366 --> 01:59:34.433]  I just stick with the things that we can prove out, and we know that human activity is causing a maximum of 6% of the heat up, and most of that is impervious cover, which acts as a heat sink, not even our emissions.
[01:59:35.268 --> 01:59:47.957]  And the main engine is the sun, and again, even if you believe in man-made global warming, their solution, a global tax, and having people inspect your house, is just a control freak's dream to get involved in our lives.
[01:59:48.277 --> 01:59:54.581]  First they brainwash everybody about the environment to worship it, now they come in with the police state, like we always told everybody.
[01:59:55.182 --> 01:59:57.743]  Here it is, government eco-snoops to inspect homes.
[01:59:58.344 --> 02:00:00.045]  They're trying that here in the US and England.
[02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:02.432]  You know, I've got all these articles.
[02:00:02.513 --> 02:00:05.137]  Scientists threatened with being fired if they don't go along.
[02:00:05.538 --> 02:00:09.806]  British government to make climate change laws that can never be challenged or rescinded.
[02:00:09.826 --> 02:00:11.850]  I mean, this is serious business.
[02:00:12.771 --> 02:00:37.331]  I also wanted to ask you Alex, there was an interview with a lady that has been in Iraq a lot on NPR last week and she talked about, I believe it was when the insurgency kind of first erupted and there were soldiers that went in to try to rescue other soldiers who had gotten trapped by these surprising insurgents and that when these second wave of rescuers came in they were basically holed up
[02:00:37.811 --> 02:00:39.312]  And where did you hear this?
[02:00:39.372 --> 02:00:41.474]  I was reading an article and you weren't clear.
[02:00:41.534 --> 02:00:42.034]  Where is this?
[02:01:06.998 --> 02:01:15.506]  This would have been, I believe, in Basra in the days when the insurgency was really just gearing up after we invaded Iraq.
[02:01:16.767 --> 02:01:17.488]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:17.668 --> 02:01:18.589]  I appreciate the call.
[02:01:20.051 --> 02:01:22.032]  You can't believe anything the government says.
[02:01:22.052 --> 02:01:23.113]  I mean, you can't.
[02:01:23.214 --> 02:01:25.015]  They plant WMD stories.
[02:01:25.816 --> 02:01:30.921]  They go in and blow up mosques in front of witnesses and say the Islamists did it to get everybody fighting with each other.
[02:01:31.733 --> 02:01:33.033]  They lie about everything.
[02:01:33.094 --> 02:01:39.476]  They've spent billions every year in fake newscasts and paid-off reporters and CIA spooks.
[02:01:41.256 --> 02:01:42.317]  And that's the problem.
[02:01:42.557 --> 02:01:43.977]  You can't go off what they're saying.
[02:01:43.997 --> 02:01:46.018]  You have to go off their battle plans.
[02:01:46.858 --> 02:01:48.939]  And the battle plans are generally available.
[02:01:49.019 --> 02:01:50.459]  They're just not publicized.
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:54.541]  I have no doubt that insurgents don't use human shields.
[02:01:55.061 --> 02:01:57.522]  I have no doubt that humankind is evil.
[02:01:58.470 --> 02:01:59.771]  The Iranians are evil.
[02:01:59.971 --> 02:02:00.912]  Our government's evil.
[02:02:01.032 --> 02:02:01.792]  Everything's evil.
[02:02:02.032 --> 02:02:02.433]  Okay?
[02:02:03.113 --> 02:02:04.614]  I tried to explain this last week.
[02:02:05.214 --> 02:02:07.896]  Hitler was fighting evil when he fought the Soviets.
[02:02:08.276 --> 02:02:09.857]  But that doesn't mean he was good.
[02:02:11.318 --> 02:02:13.380]  And see, he could say to the Germans, hey, I'm fighting evil.
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:15.761]  They knew the Bolsheviks had already killed 30 mil.
[02:02:17.182 --> 02:02:20.064]  And so they were like, the Bolsheviks are going to get you if you don't go with Hitler.
[02:02:20.664 --> 02:02:22.325]  And so they went with Hitler, and look what happened.
[02:02:24.106 --> 02:02:26.928]  Now, in this case, the Muslims haven't killed 30 mil.
[02:02:26.948 --> 02:02:27.809]  They haven't killed a mil.
[02:02:29.384 --> 02:02:31.265]  And so, it's just all boogeyman.
[02:02:31.805 --> 02:02:33.386]  Global warming's gonna get you.
[02:02:33.406 --> 02:02:35.006]  The Islamist is gonna get you.
[02:02:35.427 --> 02:02:37.828]  The Islamists are so bad, kick them out of the country!
[02:02:37.848 --> 02:02:47.412]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:47.772 --> 02:02:49.713]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:50.073 --> 02:02:57.716]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:58.402 --> 02:03:05.463]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:05.863 --> 02:03:17.285]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:17.585 --> 02:03:21.046]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:21.526 --> 02:03:23.486]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:23.806 --> 02:03:27.667]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:03.670 --> 02:04:13.034]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:04:13.274 --> 02:04:16.776]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:04:42.580 --> 02:04:46.723]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:04:46.943 --> 02:04:48.704]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:04:48.965 --> 02:04:55.249]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:04:55.549 --> 02:05:01.674]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:05:01.914 --> 02:05:03.695]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:05:03.935 --> 02:05:04.736]  We're good to go.

[02:05:30.081 --> 02:05:30.601]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[02:05:30.621 --> 02:05:30.681]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:05:45.732 --> 02:05:46.392]  Big Brother.
[02:05:47.053 --> 02:05:48.133]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:48.813 --> 02:05:49.934]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:50.594 --> 02:05:51.394]  You want answers?
[02:05:52.155 --> 02:05:53.015]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:53.035 --> 02:05:57.717]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.897 --> 02:06:02.019]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:02.499 --> 02:06:04.300]  We are taking your calls.
[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:06.841]  Part of the Ron Paul neocon speech is coming up.
[02:06:07.481 --> 02:06:14.084]  But let's go to Jesse and Roger and Mike and many others that are patiently holding.
[02:06:14.838 --> 02:06:17.439]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jesse in Canada.
[02:06:17.479 --> 02:06:18.259]  Jesse, go ahead.
[02:06:18.799 --> 02:06:20.180]  Wow, I'm actually on.
[02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:20.860]  This is amazing.
[02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:32.824]  Yeah, you're on the air with a nobody who, you know, just blow away like every other human being, and none of these possessions mean anything, and so it's no big deal to be on my show, sir.
[02:06:32.844 --> 02:06:35.304]  Oh, well, actually, I'm not a sir, Alex.
[02:06:35.324 --> 02:06:40.386]  That's a little complicated, but I'm the one and only Tranny Truther, and this is no game.
[02:06:41.336 --> 02:06:46.419]  I'm calling because I want to talk to you about the whole gay issue and that whole thing.
[02:06:46.479 --> 02:06:50.201]  First of all, I want to say that we're really allies, okay?
[02:06:50.221 --> 02:06:57.425]  I battle the NWO, I push your videos, I give pamphlets to all kinds of people.
[02:06:57.785 --> 02:07:06.450]  At my college, on the 23rd of this month, we're going to have a screening of Loose Change in a theater that holds like 50 people or more.
[02:07:07.026 --> 02:07:29.352]  So, um, I just want it known to your listeners that there are good, gay, decent people who are in the truth movement, who are battling these guys, and, you know, I just, you know, when you attack some of these people, you give the impression that all gay people are bad, that we're all card-carrying members of the NWO or something, and that simply isn't so, you know?
[02:07:29.472 --> 02:07:31.853]  So, pretty much that's why I wanted to call in.
[02:07:31.873 --> 02:07:32.813]  Hi!
[02:07:33.573 --> 02:07:33.933]  Sorry!
[02:07:35.874 --> 02:07:36.214]  Are you there?
[02:07:36.747 --> 02:07:37.728]  Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
[02:07:37.828 --> 02:07:38.348]  My sister.
[02:07:38.949 --> 02:07:39.469]  It's okay.
[02:07:39.489 --> 02:07:41.210]  Now, let me just go back here for a minute.
[02:07:43.152 --> 02:07:47.254]  I said in the last hour, I don't care if it's heterosexual or homosexual.
[02:07:48.375 --> 02:07:51.097]  No, you just weren't faggot on the air about a week ago.
[02:07:51.417 --> 02:07:54.299]  When you were talking about something Ann Coulter said.
[02:07:54.319 --> 02:07:54.840]  That's right.
[02:07:54.860 --> 02:07:55.440]  I knew it.
[02:07:56.875 --> 02:07:58.016]  Give me a break, man!
[02:07:58.296 --> 02:08:02.118]  Don't you understand this is all conditioning about what words you can and can't use?
[02:08:02.138 --> 02:08:02.958]  I know all about this stuff.
[02:08:03.198 --> 02:08:04.359]  It's mind control!
[02:08:04.719 --> 02:08:05.980]  It's mind control!
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.761]  I've learned so much stuff in the last year.
[02:08:07.801 --> 02:08:08.721]  It's mind control!
[02:08:08.741 --> 02:08:09.442]  It's mind blowing.
[02:08:09.762 --> 02:08:11.843]  I should... Hold on, put him on hold for a minute.
[02:08:13.084 --> 02:08:14.144]  Or her, or whatever.
[02:08:15.305 --> 02:08:17.326]  Okay, let me just go back here for a minute.
[02:08:20.288 --> 02:08:20.648]  Alright?
[02:08:23.790 --> 02:08:26.091]  Now, I just tried to bring up an issue
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:33.967]  No, I was talking about earlier that obviously spurred this person to call in, which is fine.
[02:08:34.907 --> 02:08:48.360]  And that is that they want to, by law, have curriculum teaching children about three penguins who are bisexual adopting another penguin, or two kings or two queens.
[02:08:51.886 --> 02:08:57.410]  Do not need to be messed with when they're four years old, or they're six years old, or they're ten years old.
[02:08:58.011 --> 02:08:58.451]  Okay?
[02:08:58.892 --> 02:09:18.227]  They need to be learning about reading, writing, and arithmetic, but the social engineers who don't procreate, they recruit, want to go into the schools, the heterosexual perverts and the homosexual perverts, and they want to get a hold of our children.
[02:09:18.903 --> 02:09:21.084]  And anyone who denies that is lying.
[02:09:21.344 --> 02:09:36.392]  I'm not saying that every person who is gay is doing this, but I'm telling you that it's wrong and we need to hear people across the political spectrum decry this.
[02:09:36.432 --> 02:09:38.313]  But no, it's backward.
[02:09:39.014 --> 02:09:42.675]  You don't want a four-year-old being taught this stuff.
[02:09:43.036 --> 02:09:44.236]  Absolutely I don't.
[02:09:46.548 --> 02:09:58.971]  There is no debating the fact, no debating the fact, that the Republican leadership, I would say it's over half of them, are homosexual.
[02:10:00.012 --> 02:10:03.113]  And this is how they blackmail each other, this is how they control each other.
[02:10:03.893 --> 02:10:06.714]  And then a large portion of them are into pedophilia.
[02:10:07.054 --> 02:10:13.575]  Now that's come out in the news over and over again, it's true, it's bigger than the Catholic priest scandal, and you watch, it's going to come out.
[02:10:14.035 --> 02:10:15.836]  It's already come out, but it's going to come out big time.
[02:10:17.179 --> 02:10:19.060]  I can see it all happening right now.
[02:10:21.041 --> 02:10:40.492]  So, people can sit there and they can, and in these words, you know, I play a hip-hop song by Parris, who's a black man, and he says in there that, you know, even the N-words have lost their minds.
[02:10:41.693 --> 02:10:43.674]  They're waving flags like they lost their minds.
[02:10:44.355 --> 02:10:49.619]  And I got emails, oh how dare you have a black man, or how dare you have someone say the n-word.
[02:10:49.759 --> 02:10:50.519]  So what?
[02:10:51.340 --> 02:10:54.102]  That's how you get rid of the power of it.
[02:10:55.103 --> 02:10:55.523]  Okay?
[02:10:56.924 --> 02:10:58.465]  It's not some holy word.
[02:11:00.046 --> 02:11:02.708]  I mean, you know, we're going to arrest you if you don't have the right light bulbs.
[02:11:02.728 --> 02:11:03.969]  We're going to inspect your house.
[02:11:04.569 --> 02:11:08.372]  We're going to make it illegal to deny global man-made warming.
[02:11:09.372 --> 02:11:12.735]  We're going to arrest you if you draw a picture of a gun in school.
[02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:14.771]  It's all mind control.
[02:11:16.552 --> 02:11:23.415]  Now, I was criticizing Ann Coulter for being a hypocrite last week.
[02:11:23.435 --> 02:11:27.657]  Why didn't she talk about Bush and all of the gay madams and people in there?
[02:11:28.238 --> 02:11:37.542]  And so, you know, a word, it's meant to take my speech, it's meant to make me think about what I'm going to say before I say it, and I'm not going to live like that.
[02:11:38.083 --> 02:11:39.503]  I'm not going to be a part of that.
[02:11:39.944 --> 02:11:42.465]  I'm going to say what I want when I want to say it.
[02:11:43.556 --> 02:11:46.797]  And if they try to send a SWAT team to stop me, they're going to have a problem!
[02:11:47.398 --> 02:11:49.139]  And let me add something else to this.
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:52.660]  Let me add something else to this.
[02:11:56.062 --> 02:12:03.645]  Robin Page, who had a non-political show, One Man and His Dog, a rural affairs show on BBC for many years, one of their top-rated shows,
[02:12:04.765 --> 02:12:11.308]  Every week he was in another little town seeing their inns and pubs and bridges and architecture.
[02:12:11.568 --> 02:12:20.233]  He'd walk with his dog, with the film crew, town to town, from Wales to Northern Scotland to Ireland.
[02:12:21.573 --> 02:12:25.875]  And he went to a rural affairs meeting in 2002 and he gave a speech and he said,
[02:12:28.030 --> 02:12:31.552]  Rural communities deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals.
[02:12:31.953 --> 02:12:34.274]  They arrested him for saying homosexual.
[02:12:34.754 --> 02:12:37.216]  That word, they decided, isn't authorized.
[02:12:37.616 --> 02:12:42.319]  Now, scientific terms aren't authorized.
[02:12:42.699 --> 02:12:44.921]  And they're trying to pass laws like that here.
[02:12:47.082 --> 02:12:49.864]  And again, it shows ignorance in the public.
[02:12:51.305 --> 02:12:53.366]  I have said the word Negro on the air.
[02:12:55.362 --> 02:12:57.043]  Well, that's the scientific name.
[02:12:57.283 --> 02:13:02.887]  Anglo, Negro, uh, I mean, these are terms the public just doesn't know.
[02:13:02.907 --> 02:13:06.809]  And of course, it's white listeners sending me emails saying, oh, that's a racial slur.
[02:13:07.049 --> 02:13:08.090]  No, it isn't, you idiot!
[02:13:11.912 --> 02:13:13.553]  It's a scientific term.
[02:13:13.894 --> 02:13:19.157]  It's the name of the variety of homo sapien sapien.
[02:13:20.718 --> 02:13:24.000]  And homosexual is the name
[02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:38.595]  That's what they call it when two male frogs get confused by hormones and are... This is unbelievable.
[02:13:38.655 --> 02:13:40.896]  Look, we just live in the Soviet... It's all over, folks.
[02:13:41.376 --> 02:13:41.696]  Okay?
[02:13:41.716 --> 02:13:51.140]  I mean, we live in a country where they'll freak out if you use the word, you know, the N-word or something, but meanwhile you can grab black kids and give them pesticide till they die.
[02:13:51.881 --> 02:13:55.142]  So great, let's freak out about the N-word and let's just murder black children.
[02:13:55.868 --> 02:13:56.188]  Okay.
[02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:58.189]  Now, you go ahead and finish up your point, Jesse.
[02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.930]  Oh, can you hear me?
[02:14:00.311 --> 02:14:00.931]  Yes, I can.
[02:14:01.151 --> 02:14:01.631]  Okay, good.
[02:14:01.691 --> 02:14:05.394]  Listen, I didn't want the whole focus being on that you said the F word, okay?
[02:14:05.414 --> 02:14:06.274]  That wasn't it at all.
[02:14:06.614 --> 02:14:12.918]  What I'm trying to get forth to your listeners and to other people is that there are gay truthers, okay?
[02:14:13.398 --> 02:14:17.661]  And this type of... The way you talk sometimes, it feels like you're alienating us.
[02:14:18.385 --> 02:14:18.965]  Well, you know what?
[02:14:19.205 --> 02:14:24.007]  I don't appreciate the fact that people say it's okay to try to recruit four-year-olds.
[02:14:24.027 --> 02:14:25.347]  No, I don't agree with that either!
[02:14:25.367 --> 02:14:25.447]  Good!
[02:14:25.487 --> 02:14:27.428]  Children should be left alone.
[02:14:27.468 --> 02:14:28.628]  I'm not supporting that.
[02:14:28.668 --> 02:14:29.608]  Well, I wasn't talking about you.
[02:14:29.628 --> 02:14:34.710]  I mean, the main reason, like I said, I called in is because, one, I'm usually in school and I can't call you.
[02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:36.350]  I listen to your show every day.
[02:14:36.831 --> 02:14:44.493]  I have defended you to countless people who call you an agent or a Zionist or a friggin' whatever else is going on at the time.
[02:14:45.093 --> 02:14:49.216]  I push your videos, I do all this stuff, and yet I feel like I'm not getting no love, Alex.
[02:14:49.556 --> 02:14:49.857]  You know?
[02:14:50.157 --> 02:14:52.899]  It's just like, oh, they're just that, you know?
[02:14:53.259 --> 02:14:55.901]  Well, it's not going to be the Christians that save us, Alex.
[02:14:56.241 --> 02:14:57.902]  It's going to be all of us together.
[02:14:58.202 --> 02:15:00.464]  The blacks, the whites, the straights, the gays.
[02:15:00.904 --> 02:15:02.445]  All of us together, okay?
[02:15:02.886 --> 02:15:06.288]  And I just think that there's this, like I said, this division going on.
[02:15:06.924 --> 02:15:09.966]  You see it with the Christian truthers or the non-Christians.
[02:15:10.046 --> 02:15:11.047]  Let me just say this to you.
[02:15:11.187 --> 02:15:17.290]  I do love you and I do care about you and I believe there are a lot of folks who are gay who are great, good people.
[02:15:17.871 --> 02:15:18.311]  Okay?
[02:15:18.891 --> 02:15:22.514]  But I'm telling you, statistically, it is not a healthy lifestyle.
[02:15:22.554 --> 02:15:23.994]  Yeah, there's a lot of freaks out there, Alex.
[02:15:24.095 --> 02:15:24.435]  I know.
[02:15:24.475 --> 02:15:25.215]  Well, let me just go back.
[02:15:25.235 --> 02:15:25.856]  Let me just go back.
[02:15:26.356 --> 02:15:31.179]  I'm telling you, it's not a healthy lifestyle for you and that isn't a crime.
[02:15:31.199 --> 02:15:32.920]  I mean, do you know the statistics?
[02:15:34.304 --> 02:15:39.288]  I know lots of statistics, but like we show on this show, statistics can be manipulated, Alex.
[02:15:39.988 --> 02:15:40.509]  Come on.
[02:15:40.649 --> 02:15:43.171]  Not the life expectancy statistics.
[02:15:43.511 --> 02:15:44.231]  Those are higher.
[02:15:44.272 --> 02:15:47.554]  I don't really fall into that category, so it's not my thing, okay?
[02:15:47.614 --> 02:15:50.156]  Like, it's hard for a lot of people to understand that, okay?
[02:15:50.536 --> 02:15:52.838]  But I'm just saying that
[02:15:53.505 --> 02:15:55.907]  Well, there's a lot of people who are gay who don't even have sex, Alex.
[02:15:56.007 --> 02:15:56.508]  You know what I mean?
[02:15:56.528 --> 02:15:58.509]  Everybody has this thing in their mind.
[02:15:58.529 --> 02:15:59.470]  No, I understand that.
[02:16:00.131 --> 02:16:00.671]  I understand that.
[02:16:00.691 --> 02:16:01.952]  Listen... Anyway, I won't keep you.
[02:16:01.992 --> 02:16:02.853]  You've got callers.
[02:16:02.893 --> 02:16:03.914]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:16:03.954 --> 02:16:07.477]  Thank you for acknowledging the gay truthers out there and that we have worth.
[02:16:08.538 --> 02:16:11.220]  Well, I mean, you don't need me to... Let's make one thing clear.
[02:16:12.301 --> 02:16:14.663]  You shouldn't have to have anybody acknowledge you.
[02:16:16.124 --> 02:16:16.504]  Okay?
[02:16:19.687 --> 02:16:20.508]  It's just incredible.
[02:16:22.262 --> 02:16:45.179]  There's this black TV show that's been on for like 20 something years in Austin and these guys are so ignorant that they've had prank callers that call them for years yelling the n-word at them and the person will say this is Alex Jones and then n-word and about five years ago I'm sitting there with my wife on one of the rare occasions she's pregnant
[02:16:45.822 --> 02:16:53.907]  We're watching TV, eating dinner in front of the television set, and I'm watching AXS TV, and these guys are calling in saying the N-word, and saying they're Alex Jones.
[02:16:55.008 --> 02:17:01.252]  So I call in, and I tell them, no, no, this is Alex Jones, that's not me.
[02:17:02.953 --> 02:17:06.955]  And then later I found out they'd already thought that I was doing it and complained about me.
[02:17:09.517 --> 02:17:12.439]  And so I go down to AXS TV, I happen to see them down there one time,
[02:17:15.143 --> 02:17:19.827]  And I walk up to them, and I say, you know, that's not me.
[02:17:20.928 --> 02:17:23.470]  I'm not racist.
[02:17:23.530 --> 02:17:24.591]  I'm not saying that about you.
[02:17:24.611 --> 02:17:25.632]  They're like, sure.
[02:17:26.273 --> 02:17:28.335]  You know, we forgive you, whatever you've done.
[02:17:28.355 --> 02:17:30.997]  And of course, these guys are real racist and are always talking bad about whites.
[02:17:31.858 --> 02:17:34.240]  You know, I don't owe you anything.
[02:17:34.460 --> 02:17:35.821]  I haven't done anything to you.
[02:17:37.082 --> 02:17:37.883]  You understand that?

[02:18:33.717 --> 02:18:34.377]  We're good to go.
[02:18:53.345 --> 02:18:54.025]  We're good to go.
[02:19:11.491 --> 02:19:11.931]  I think so.
[02:19:41.104 --> 02:19:48.048]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[02:19:49.308 --> 02:19:53.370]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[02:19:54.091 --> 02:20:01.134]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[02:20:02.035 --> 02:20:10.779]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[02:20:41.881 --> 02:20:48.389]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:20:48.609 --> 02:20:52.654]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:20:52.894 --> 02:20:55.037]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:20:55.417 --> 02:20:57.039]  All Natural Non-X clears out the

[02:21:50.396 --> 02:21:55.782]  Alright, I gotta play this Neocon speech and see I end up going to one caller and spending 15 minutes with them, but that's okay, whatever.
[02:21:56.883 --> 02:22:00.907]  Let's go ahead and talk to Roger in Ohio and Christopher, John and others.
[02:22:01.248 --> 02:22:01.948]  Go ahead, Roger.
[02:22:03.310 --> 02:22:11.779]  First off, didn't you hear anything about New Mexico doing that vaccine now for girls?
[02:22:13.169 --> 02:22:43.009]  Yeah, I know a little bit about the HPV virus, live cancer virus injection that doesn't protect you from 126 plus strains of it and is also causing massive autoimmune responses and convulsions and costs $900 plus dollars on average to administer the three-round shot and now the piece of filth governor, Bill Richardson, Bilderberg, Bohemian Grove member is lying in a giant criminal hoax because the government is completely rogue and is saying it's the law, you have to take it.
[02:22:44.651 --> 02:22:48.454]  Isn't there like 300 million citizens in the United States?
[02:22:48.474 --> 02:22:53.639]  The way I see it, there's 300 million of us and a couple hundred thousands of them.
[02:23:01.154 --> 02:23:13.903]  But they're arrogant and hateful and know how to exercise power and know what truth from lies are, but they've decided to be evil, and so they're waging war on us, but you can't get the nation of cattle to wake up to evil around them.
[02:23:13.923 --> 02:23:16.325]  Thanks for the call.
[02:23:16.645 --> 02:23:23.790]  I've really been in a shimmering dark mood the last few days, and I apologize about it, but I'm really just seeing things clearly.
[02:23:24.951 --> 02:23:26.913]  And we need to all think about how pathetic we are.
[02:23:26.953 --> 02:23:27.673]  I'm pathetic.
[02:23:27.693 --> 02:23:28.594]  We're just pathetic.
[02:23:30.026 --> 02:23:35.949]  We need to just get down and realize how pathetic we are before we can set about being better again.
[02:23:38.510 --> 02:23:40.331]  Christopher in Pennsylvania, here on the air.
[02:23:40.351 --> 02:23:44.873]  Hi sir, first time caller, love your show, love your latest movie.
[02:23:45.173 --> 02:23:49.676]  I'm actually calling for about one of your articles up on the... Sure, what is it?
[02:23:49.696 --> 02:23:51.717]  ...thing about the Screw Loose Change exposed.
[02:23:51.797 --> 02:23:58.540]  It does seem to be that it's a hoax and Pat's still blogging over it, Screw Loose Change.
[02:23:59.895 --> 02:24:02.716]  So I believe, I'm pretty sure it is a hoax.
[02:24:02.796 --> 02:24:07.598]  I'm a 9-1-1 truther by myself, so just to make things clear.
[02:24:07.699 --> 02:24:09.920]  I commented over there.
[02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:13.481]  I mean, I think, you must have not understood what I said in the first hour.
[02:24:13.501 --> 02:24:18.403]  I didn't listen to your show except since I called in.
[02:24:19.004 --> 02:24:22.065]  So, I was about to tell you, I didn't hear what I first said.
[02:24:22.529 --> 02:24:23.470]  I'll tell you that.
[02:24:23.810 --> 02:24:29.193]  And two, I wouldn't assure you that I... Well, you've got to realize 90% of listeners don't even know what we're talking about, but hell, let's just do it.
[02:24:29.233 --> 02:24:29.593]  Go ahead.
[02:24:29.913 --> 02:24:33.055]  ...tuned in is why I didn't know what you said.
[02:24:33.135 --> 02:24:38.598]  I'm referring to what your website is saying, not what your radio said earlier, sir.
[02:24:38.959 --> 02:24:45.142]  And just to assure you, I'm human online, and I made a couple comments over there, and they're busy deleting them.
[02:24:45.763 --> 02:24:47.283]  But... Oh, that's what they're doing over there.
[02:24:47.303 --> 02:24:51.666]  I made a couple comments over at Screw Loose Change, I should say, not Screw Loose Change Exposed.
[02:24:52.613 --> 02:24:55.155]  Let me just try to say something real quick, here if I can.
[02:24:55.876 --> 02:24:59.018]  Okay?
[02:24:59.238 --> 02:25:06.224]  Again, that shows how they're into free discussion over there, is that they won't let anybody post on their site that isn't an officer of the government.
[02:25:07.385 --> 02:25:08.045]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:25:08.926 --> 02:25:15.471]  Okay, well anyways, so it does seem that the screw loose change seems to be
[02:25:16.061 --> 02:25:19.964]  Yeah, it wouldn't be a hoax, it would be a lie, another deception.
[02:25:19.984 --> 02:25:21.685]  Unfortunately, unfortunately, and I appreciate your call.
[02:25:41.079 --> 02:25:54.389]  Unfortunately, unless we were to describe what's going on first, 90 plus percent of people will have no idea what we're even discussing right now.
[02:25:55.130 --> 02:25:55.890]  No one knows.
[02:25:56.931 --> 02:25:57.972]  It has no effect.
[02:25:58.692 --> 02:26:01.074]  It's like we're having a private discussion on the radio.
[02:26:03.596 --> 02:26:04.997]  And hell, maybe that's what we're meant to do.
[02:26:08.379 --> 02:26:08.540]  Okay?
[02:26:11.912 --> 02:26:13.813]  Since you brought it up, let me give people some background.
[02:26:16.634 --> 02:26:30.278]  Prominent 9-11 truth debunker admits smear tactics, confessions to Holocaust denial, attack invented, states there is no honesty to debunking 9-11 truth.
[02:26:31.414 --> 02:26:42.960]  And when I saw this, I did think, well, this could be their way of just getting desperate attention from 9-11 Truth, because nobody's really visiting these debunking sites, and they've been thoroughly debunked.
[02:26:45.741 --> 02:26:49.963]  But then I read deeper into it, and regardless, they may not know.
[02:26:50.123 --> 02:26:56.086]  Either way, this gives us a window into how they operate.
[02:26:57.907 --> 02:26:58.287]  Alright?
[02:26:59.522 --> 02:27:01.383]  And I've met the head guy that runs it, man.
[02:27:01.603 --> 02:27:04.785]  I mean, you talk about... You talk about creepy.
[02:27:04.805 --> 02:27:06.126]  You talk about bad news.
[02:27:07.407 --> 02:27:08.688]  Off the chart, man.
[02:27:09.708 --> 02:27:12.090]  And these guys know full well what they're doing.
[02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:15.552]  They know full well what they're doing on 9-11.
[02:27:16.492 --> 02:27:17.293]  They're not stupid.
[02:27:17.333 --> 02:27:17.553]  Look.
[02:27:18.654 --> 02:27:19.995]  It doesn't matter, folks.
[02:27:20.095 --> 02:27:22.336]  We've won the fight on 9-11, okay?
[02:27:22.896 --> 02:27:25.318]  But we're in so much trouble on a thousand other fronts.
[02:27:26.791 --> 02:27:29.733]  Who knows if it even matters, but I'll talk about this when we get back.
[02:27:31.494 --> 02:27:32.415]  We're on the march.
[02:27:32.875 --> 02:27:34.476]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:34.496 --> 02:27:38.179]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:41.401 --> 02:27:47.425]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:27:48.006 --> 02:27:48.746]  Globalists are conservative.
[02:27:56.058 --> 02:27:56.559]  We're good.
[02:28:13.780 --> 02:28:14.981]  We're good to go.
[02:28:36.138 --> 02:28:36.518]  We're good to go.
[02:28:51.477 --> 02:28:54.638]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[02:28:54.879 --> 02:28:58.560]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:06.784]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.

[02:29:34.962 --> 02:29:38.945]  Unless she repents, America will not survive the Red Horse of World War III.
[02:29:40.692 --> 02:29:43.294]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[02:29:43.454 --> 02:29:49.598]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[02:29:49.738 --> 02:29:58.885]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.
[02:29:59.105 --> 02:29:59.866]  It's called Slender FX.

[02:30:51.383 --> 02:30:53.404]  Alright, let me just break this down.
[02:30:54.765 --> 02:30:57.286]  I never wanted to go to the Arizona conference.
[02:30:58.846 --> 02:30:59.507]  Never wanted to.
[02:30:59.527 --> 02:31:03.448]  And people begged and said, oh, please come.
[02:31:03.468 --> 02:31:05.249]  So for a week or so I said, yeah, I'll go.
[02:31:05.849 --> 02:31:16.554]  And I was already going to cancel and not go, because I went to the Chicago conference, and they were supposed to pay for my plane ticket.
[02:31:16.954 --> 02:31:18.515]  They didn't pay for it.
[02:31:19.776 --> 02:31:20.757]  And I'm just tired of that.
[02:31:20.797 --> 02:31:24.780]  You know, everybody I said I'd pay for their tickets and flying them out there in their hotel, I did pay for it.
[02:31:25.641 --> 02:31:26.301]  Which is fine.
[02:31:26.341 --> 02:31:28.203]  That's just how people are in the world, period.
[02:31:29.704 --> 02:31:30.905]  And, you know, you fill the place.
[02:31:30.965 --> 02:31:33.387]  Half the people there were there from the show.
[02:31:33.407 --> 02:31:34.268]  They didn't care.
[02:31:34.288 --> 02:31:35.529]  Just, you're not getting paid, man.
[02:31:36.069 --> 02:31:37.110]  Which is fine, you know.
[02:31:38.291 --> 02:31:41.614]  By the way, my staff bought non-refundable tickets for some reason.
[02:31:43.175 --> 02:31:46.177]  And so I'd already bought tickets to this Arizona thing.
[02:31:46.217 --> 02:31:48.079]  So that cost me money, too.
[02:31:48.934 --> 02:31:58.580]  Then I got it from good sources that there was going to be operatives there and media there trying to bring up Holocaust denial, which you can debate either or all day long.
[02:31:58.600 --> 02:32:02.042]  The point is, that's not what 9-11 Truth is about, to inject it.
[02:32:02.582 --> 02:32:07.525]  And I knew that had been a government tactic, so I knew that had to be feds doing that, or globalists, or their minions.
[02:32:10.146 --> 02:32:13.128]  And I was already not going to go, so I was like, eh, I'm not going to that.
[02:32:13.428 --> 02:32:14.789]  No, there's no, I'm not going to that.
[02:32:15.987 --> 02:32:19.368]  There was lots of squealing and flopping around asking why I didn't.
[02:32:22.409 --> 02:32:30.192]  And so then we get the screw loose change people who nobody visits their site.
[02:32:30.232 --> 02:32:38.334]  Literally they have absolutely no ratings on the web rating systems out there because big shows won't talk about them and give them what they want.
[02:32:38.674 --> 02:32:40.895]  And so I guess they did cook up an elaborate
[02:32:41.578 --> 02:32:45.001]  Because right now they're trying to act like, okay, now we're hoaxing you.
[02:32:45.381 --> 02:32:46.122]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:32:46.182 --> 02:32:48.163]  It shows you how they are a hoax.
[02:32:48.804 --> 02:32:49.765]  They are a fraud.
[02:32:50.205 --> 02:32:58.812]  And you go to their other auxiliary sites, there's no New World Order, there's no world government, there's no North American Union, there's no government corruption.
[02:32:59.273 --> 02:33:00.574]  None of it's real, folks.
[02:33:00.714 --> 02:33:01.975]  Everything's fine.
[02:33:03.036 --> 02:33:05.037]  Everything's wonderful.
[02:33:07.179 --> 02:33:07.660]  And then, uh,
[02:33:09.002 --> 02:33:19.634]  These guys, even if this is a hoax, which is what I said earlier, regardless they've gone public, you know, because they can't stand being around this, or it shows you the operation they're running, either way they're exposed.
[02:33:21.997 --> 02:33:28.364]  And this individual who works over at our post for that quote 9-11 debunking site,
[02:33:29.921 --> 02:33:32.942]  Which builds strongmen or attack kooks arguments.
[02:33:32.962 --> 02:33:36.584]  You know they have operatives and their minions that go out and say ridiculous things.
[02:33:36.644 --> 02:33:38.225]  Laser beams hit the towers.
[02:33:38.605 --> 02:33:41.886]  No planes hit them.
[02:33:41.966 --> 02:33:46.668]  So we can be discredited because the national media and the government can't discredit our facts.
[02:33:46.908 --> 02:33:51.910]  They've got to go out and have their own people bring up kooky stuff to then give it attention and discredit it.
[02:33:52.210 --> 02:33:53.491]  Now there's a snowball effect.
[02:33:53.511 --> 02:33:57.973]  There's some people who really believe this stuff and some people who think green lizards did it and you know that's
[02:33:58.733 --> 02:34:00.514]  So there's some genuine nuts out there.
[02:34:03.016 --> 02:34:06.959]  But O'Reilly doesn't want to have Kevin Ryan of Underwriting Laboratories on to talk about Building 7.
[02:34:07.259 --> 02:34:09.040]  No, no, no, no.
[02:34:09.060 --> 02:34:10.381]  They want to talk about space beams.
[02:34:11.322 --> 02:34:12.403]  This is how they operate.
[02:34:14.504 --> 02:34:24.191]  And then this individual puts out a report saying that he was told to be nice to one of the biggest dis-info conduits, whether it's conscious or unconscious.
[02:34:25.786 --> 02:34:38.660]  And how he was told to basically mix in anti-Semitism into the meeting regardless, and the way it's implied, like push it, bring it up, to get the report.
[02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:41.863]  Well, that's what the media and the government does anyways.
[02:34:42.702 --> 02:35:01.813]  I mean, hell, they got a bunch of sites we know that are run by Feds, where they beat everybody in the 9-11 Truth Movement's head in, try to bully you either into space beams, no planes or both, or the Jews did it, and then if you won't say Jews did it, and Jews are the source of all evil, then you're a devil Jew yourself.
[02:35:04.395 --> 02:35:09.738]  And that's because they can't stop this movement, and so they want to try to get us to self-destruct ourselves.
[02:35:09.838 --> 02:35:11.279]  Let me just give you the news flash, folks.
[02:35:12.373 --> 02:35:14.616]  Nothing can put your story back together again.
[02:35:15.036 --> 02:35:21.443]  You cannot reverse what's happening, and you cannot reverse what your masters are doing, and nothing can stop this, okay?
[02:35:23.044 --> 02:35:23.905]  You can't stop it.
[02:35:24.245 --> 02:35:25.527]  Nothing can turn it around now.
[02:35:25.787 --> 02:35:27.929]  Let me just give you that little news flash, okay?
[02:35:28.710 --> 02:35:30.312]  And I don't take any pleasure in this, too.
[02:35:30.352 --> 02:35:32.514]  I'm extremely upset about everything that's happening.
[02:35:33.630 --> 02:35:36.151]  And I wish to God what we talked about wasn't true.
[02:35:36.672 --> 02:35:38.653]  Believe me, I wish the government wasn't corrupt.
[02:35:38.933 --> 02:35:41.695]  Believe me, I wish they wouldn't have flown those planes into those buildings.
[02:35:42.215 --> 02:35:45.136]  Believe me, I wish the hijackers wouldn't have been trained at military bases.
[02:35:45.537 --> 02:35:54.081]  Believe me, I wish that Oklahoma City wasn't bombed by the government and that Danny Colson hadn't gone public saying there's a cover-up, needs to be a new investigation.
[02:35:55.122 --> 02:35:55.462]  Okay?
[02:35:56.483 --> 02:35:58.384]  Believe me, I wish none of that was true.
[02:35:58.444 --> 02:35:59.504]  But it is, okay?
[02:35:59.845 --> 02:36:00.845]  It really is true.
[02:36:01.145 --> 02:36:02.286]  Bad things are happening.
[02:36:02.808 --> 02:36:05.110]  They really did lie to us about WMDs.
[02:36:05.370 --> 02:36:07.151]  They're about to lie us into another war.
[02:36:08.833 --> 02:36:10.074]  They really did lie to the troops.
[02:36:10.114 --> 02:36:11.555]  They've been there four years now.
[02:36:12.015 --> 02:36:13.376]  They're going to be there four years later.
[02:36:14.277 --> 02:36:16.399]  And the electronic voting machines are a fraud.
[02:36:16.419 --> 02:36:19.041]  And they are building prisons everywhere.
[02:36:19.801 --> 02:36:21.422]  And it's just, we're in trouble.
[02:36:22.163 --> 02:36:25.446]  So I hope all of you debunkers are happy with yourselves.
[02:36:25.846 --> 02:36:27.347]  And I just hope everybody's happy.
[02:36:27.627 --> 02:36:29.228]  Because we're not in a good position here.
[02:36:29.489 --> 02:36:29.709]  Okay?
[02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:38.302]  The CIA now admits they put Mao Zedong into power.
[02:36:38.963 --> 02:36:41.064]  Now, we've always known that, now it's admitted.
[02:36:41.764 --> 02:36:43.665]  The guy killed 60 million people.
[02:36:44.586 --> 02:36:48.528]  That's the Chinese government's own number.
[02:36:48.548 --> 02:36:49.289]  60 million!
[02:36:52.150 --> 02:36:54.211]  David Rockefeller wrote the eulogy for him.
[02:36:56.633 --> 02:37:00.175]  They believe in organized systems, organized control populations.
[02:37:01.408 --> 02:37:03.549]  Hitler did kill millions, tens of millions.
[02:37:03.889 --> 02:37:05.530]  Stalin killed 50 plus million.
[02:37:06.010 --> 02:37:15.135]  And the people that funded those individuals, and you cannot debate that the big money men did, funded them just to tear stuff up, just to dominate populations.
[02:37:16.656 --> 02:37:20.998]  And to build up a response to it here domestically to destroy our way of life.
[02:37:21.869 --> 02:37:34.139]  And if you can't look at the news and read the newspaper and look at legislation, and if you don't know that our country's in trouble, and if you don't know our society isn't falling apart, there is something fundamentally wrong with you.
[02:37:37.962 --> 02:37:39.464]  Let's go to John in Ohio.
[02:37:39.484 --> 02:37:41.625]  I'm going to play a Ron Paul clip, and then we'll go to more of your calls.
[02:37:41.645 --> 02:37:42.186]  Go ahead, John.
[02:37:43.283 --> 02:37:53.665]  Yes, Alex, I called in just originally to say that you should take reception reports and tell your screener, but then listening to some of the things that were brought up, I wanted to go beyond that.
[02:37:53.885 --> 02:37:58.727]  I like that other person who said he was gay.
[02:37:59.767 --> 02:38:03.428]  You know, I believe in much of what you're doing.
[02:38:03.588 --> 02:38:09.109]  I've advertised your terrorist storm on major talk shows and the rest of it.
[02:38:09.912 --> 02:38:17.353]  But listening to some of these things about the disinformation that we all know goes on.
[02:38:17.433 --> 02:38:24.695]  You know, you mentioned, somebody called in and talked about the supposed insurgents doing this kind of atrocity.
[02:38:24.735 --> 02:38:27.075]  We know about the incubator babies atrocities.
[02:38:27.135 --> 02:38:35.316]  We know about the overthrow of Mossadegh, where the communists and Mossadegh were blamed by false flags, CIA terrorism.
[02:38:36.096 --> 02:38:39.357]  This kind of terrorism, this kind of disinformation goes on.
[02:38:39.867 --> 02:38:58.551]  And I believe that, in a way, I've listened to so much Nazi retail propaganda through the CIA, through the John Birch Society, that has just taken as good coin, down through the years, that was retailed by the Nazis who were brought into the CIA after the Second World War, who had ties to the Birch Society.
[02:38:59.291 --> 02:39:03.272]  J. Edgar Hoover penned a lot of this stuff, I hear it repeated back to me on this.
[02:39:03.352 --> 02:39:08.313]  David J. Smith dribbled constantly this kindergarten propaganda about the
[02:39:08.737 --> 02:39:12.919]  Communists wanted to corrupt our youth and get them involved in sex.
[02:39:13.379 --> 02:39:16.000]  This is the kind of stuff that Joseph Goebbels invented.
[02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:26.444]  So I'm on the left, and I believe that Stalin was a criminal, and the Soviet Union wasn't a genuine socialist country.
[02:39:26.624 --> 02:39:37.548]  I believe that we've been subjected to a massive disinformation, laundered through our own government, through the Birch Society, and many satellites down through the years to get us involved in these wars.
[02:39:38.521 --> 02:39:40.807]  I recall... Let me ask you a question.
[02:39:41.609 --> 02:39:41.970]  Go ahead.
[02:39:43.734 --> 02:39:45.819]  Do you believe in man-made global warming?
[02:39:45.839 --> 02:39:47.423]  Do you think a global tax would save us?
[02:39:48.195 --> 02:39:49.335]  Absolutely not.
[02:39:49.595 --> 02:39:50.356]  Absolutely not.
[02:39:50.376 --> 02:39:55.897]  But to blame communists, this was actually when you said that they're green on the outside, red on the inside.
[02:39:56.217 --> 02:40:02.219]  This is a variation of what Hitler said about his own brown shirts before he slaughtered them, when he could no longer control them.
[02:40:02.599 --> 02:40:04.120]  Because he thought they were... What did he say?
[02:40:04.140 --> 02:40:06.320]  Brown on the outside, red on the inside?
[02:40:06.540 --> 02:40:07.521]  Yes, exactly.
[02:40:07.841 --> 02:40:11.982]  So what I'm saying is much of this stuff that we supposedly know about the Soviet Union
[02:40:12.452 --> 02:40:36.899]  and uh... and uh... so-called communism was just what was concocted by nazis originally and then retailed by the the british society the uh... uh... jigger hoover and the cia after the second world war much of what we claim now is coming for a while and there's no doubt that they use right wingers to carry out hits and stuff because they believe it but the climate john birch society is floating around on top of things is pretty ridiculous
[02:40:37.279 --> 02:40:50.168]  Well, I've seen the connections to the Nazis who were brought into this after the Second World War and the John Birch Society on various sites, and they do have connections to those Nazis and peddling much of that kind of bloated propaganda.
[02:40:50.628 --> 02:41:04.317]  All I'm saying is that I absolutely agree with you that there's much infiltration of some of the very useful sites like Common Dreams and ZMAG.org by some of these anti-
[02:41:05.164 --> 02:41:06.565]  9-11 debunkers.
[02:41:06.865 --> 02:41:09.285]  I believe that they do infiltrate them.
[02:41:09.325 --> 02:41:11.166]  They've infiltrated the Nation magazine.
[02:41:11.566 --> 02:41:13.106]  And I get absolutely disgusted.
[02:41:13.126 --> 02:41:14.107]  I can find no hope.
[02:41:14.207 --> 02:41:15.447]  I agree with what you're saying.
[02:41:15.487 --> 02:41:17.428]  I wish you would have better reception.
[02:41:17.488 --> 02:41:18.668]  I can't pick you up anymore.
[02:41:18.688 --> 02:41:21.269]  What do you listen on, shortwave?
[02:41:21.649 --> 02:41:22.669]  I listen on shortwave.
[02:41:23.289 --> 02:41:26.670]  Yes, but all I'm saying is... What frequency do you listen to during the day?
[02:41:26.690 --> 02:41:26.670]  9.9, 9.985.
[02:41:30.095 --> 02:41:32.197]  And I think you ought to take reception reports.
[02:41:32.438 --> 02:41:34.360]  Fine, I'll do that.
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:36.582]  And I've been asking for days.
[02:41:36.902 --> 02:41:38.264]  They change frequencies at night.
[02:41:38.484 --> 02:41:39.305]  What are we on at night?
[02:41:39.325 --> 02:41:41.427]  Have we never discovered that network?
[02:41:43.429 --> 02:41:45.351]  I'm not sure, but I'd like to know.
[02:41:45.771 --> 02:41:53.239]  But mainly what I called in to say is that I think since we know they lie about getting us involved in Iraq and to Iran,
[02:41:53.703 --> 02:41:59.105]  They've lied about atrocities around the world during the Reagan administration.
[02:41:59.145 --> 02:42:06.908]  They blamed the crimes of Somoza and pictures of Somoza's atrocities on the left and the Sandinistas.
[02:42:07.688 --> 02:42:10.569]  During the Vietnam War, they blamed... I gotta go, man.
[02:42:10.589 --> 02:42:11.829]  I understand.
[02:42:11.869 --> 02:42:13.510]  The commies are gonna save us, John.
[02:42:15.571 --> 02:42:16.831]  I mean, anything else, John?
[02:42:17.771 --> 02:42:26.513]  Yeah, well, I'm saying that kind of categorical statement is what's going to turn a lot of progressive people off from your program.
[02:42:26.533 --> 02:42:27.253]  I just don't care.
[02:42:27.293 --> 02:42:28.513]  Have you figured that out, John?
[02:42:28.773 --> 02:42:32.994]  No, I'm saying anyone who's thinking... I may not even keep doing this show, if you really want to know the truth.
[02:42:33.174 --> 02:42:36.775]  You're doing great work, but... No, everything's going to hell in a handbasket.
[02:42:37.235 --> 02:42:41.536]  They're going to put us in camps, they're going to have their way with us, because we're a bunch of idiots.
[02:42:41.596 --> 02:42:42.436]  I appreciate your call.
[02:42:43.116 --> 02:42:45.077]  That's just the way it is.
[02:42:45.097 --> 02:42:46.137]  That's the way it is!
[02:42:46.983 --> 02:42:47.623]  You're slaves?
[02:42:47.643 --> 02:42:48.464]  You're going to be slaves?
[02:42:48.504 --> 02:42:49.644]  It's going to get worse, okay?
[02:42:50.004 --> 02:42:53.425]  You want to know what I mean?
[02:42:55.066 --> 02:42:56.406]  I'm just so sick of the ignorance.
[02:42:57.167 --> 02:43:00.088]  And people get so wedded to an idea.
[02:43:01.708 --> 02:43:04.069]  Everywhere the communists go, it doesn't work.
[02:43:04.229 --> 02:43:06.250]  Everywhere they go, they kill a bunch of people.
[02:43:06.590 --> 02:43:07.390]  It's government.
[02:43:07.470 --> 02:43:09.551]  It's people, people, people, people.
[02:43:10.031 --> 02:43:11.312]  It's power structures.
[02:43:11.892 --> 02:43:14.253]  Every time you get a power structure, it becomes abusive.
[02:43:15.911 --> 02:43:19.292]  You can do is try to reduce the size of power structures.
[02:43:21.952 --> 02:43:23.673]  Let's go ahead and play this Ron Paul clip.
[02:43:23.693 --> 02:43:25.953]  Here it is.
[02:43:25.993 --> 02:43:30.334]  Dr. Paul is recognized for 60 minutes as a Deputy Majority Leader.
[02:43:31.815 --> 02:43:35.435]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks.
[02:43:35.455 --> 02:43:36.235]  Without objection.
[02:43:37.096 --> 02:43:43.057]  Mr. Speaker, the modern day limited government movement has been co-opted.
[02:43:43.948 --> 02:43:48.411]  The conservatives have failed in their efforts to shrink the size of government.
[02:43:49.092 --> 02:43:53.715]  There has not been, nor will there soon be, a conservative revolution in Washington.
[02:43:54.396 --> 02:44:01.821]  Party control of the federal government has changed, but the inexorable growth in the size and scope of government has continued unabated.
[02:44:03.002 --> 02:44:11.729]  The liberal arguments for limited government in personal affairs and foreign military adventurism were never seriously considered as part of this revolution.
[02:44:12.682 --> 02:44:18.466]  Since the change of the political party in charge has not made a difference, who's really in charge?
[02:44:19.207 --> 02:44:36.219]  If the particular party in power makes little difference, whose policy is it that permits expanded government programs, increase ending, huge deficits, nation building, and the pervasive invasion of our privacy with fewer Fourth Amendment protections than ever before?
[02:44:38.163 --> 02:44:50.929]  Someone is responsible, and it's important for those of us who love liberty and resent big brother government identify the philosophic supporters who have the most to say about the direction our country is going.
[02:44:51.870 --> 02:44:59.914]  If they're wrong, and I believe they are, we need to show it, alert the American people, and offer a more positive approach to government.
[02:45:00.859 --> 02:45:13.511]  However, this depends on whether the American people desire to live in a free society and reject the dangerous notion that we need a strong central government to take care of us from cradle to grave.
[02:45:14.331 --> 02:45:21.398]  Do the American people really believe it's the government's responsibility to make us morally better and economically equal?
[02:45:22.344 --> 02:45:32.051]  Do we have a responsibility to police the world while imposing our vision of good government on everyone else in the world with some form of utopian nation-building?
[02:45:33.012 --> 02:45:51.885]  If not, and the contemporary enemies of liberty are exposed and rejected, then it behooves us to present an alternative philosophy that is morally superior and economically sound and provides a guide to world affairs to enhance peace and commerce.
[02:45:53.411 --> 02:45:54.371]  One thing is certain.
[02:45:54.732 --> 02:45:59.974]  Conservatives who worked and voted for less government in the Reagan years, over of the U.S.
[02:46:00.014 --> 02:46:05.255]  Congress and the presidency in the 1990s and early 2000s, were deceived.
[02:46:05.736 --> 02:46:12.178]  Soon they will realize that the goal of limited government has been dashed, and that their views no longer matter.
[02:46:13.298 --> 02:46:22.502]  The so-called conservative revolution of the past two decades has given us massive growth in government size, spending, and regulations.
[02:46:23.467 --> 02:46:29.890]  Deficits are exploding and the national debt is now rising at a greater than a half trillion dollars per year.
[02:46:30.731 --> 02:46:34.593]  Taxes do not go down, even if we vote to lower them.
[02:46:35.333 --> 02:46:42.317]  They can't, as long as spending is increased, since all spending must be paid for one way or another.
[02:46:43.058 --> 02:46:47.220]  Both Presidents Reagan and the elder George Bush raised taxes directly.
[02:46:47.740 --> 02:46:53.043]  With this administration so far, direct taxes have been reduced, and they certainly should have been.
[02:46:53.860 --> 02:46:57.961]  But it means little if spending increases and deficits rise.
[02:46:59.021 --> 02:47:06.963]  When taxes are not raised to accommodate higher spending, the bills must be paid for by either borrowing or printing new money.
[02:47:07.823 --> 02:47:14.305]  This is one reason why we conveniently have a generous Federal Reserve Chairman who is willing to accommodate the Congress.
[02:47:15.057 --> 02:47:24.360]  With borrowing and inflating, the tax is delayed and distributed in a way that makes it difficult for those paying the tax to identify it.
[02:47:25.500 --> 02:47:39.064]  Like future generations, those on fixed incomes who suffer from rising prices, and those who lose jobs, they certainly feel the consequence of economic dislocation that this process causes.
[02:47:40.242 --> 02:47:48.206]  Government spending is always a tax burden on the American people and is never equally or fairly distributed.
[02:47:49.107 --> 02:47:56.650]  The poor and low-middle-income workers always suffer the most from the deceitful tax of inflation and borrowing.
[02:47:57.871 --> 02:48:09.257]  Many present-day conservatives who generally argue for less government and supported the Reagan, Gingrich, Bush takeover of the federal government are now justifiably disillusioned.
[02:48:09.992 --> 02:48:15.134]  Although not a monolithic group, they wanted to shrink the size of government.
[02:48:16.495 --> 02:48:23.718]  Early in our history, the advocates of limited constitutional government recognized... This thing's like 40 minutes long.
[02:48:23.778 --> 02:48:26.980]  Maybe I should take a whole hour out tomorrow and just play it in its entirety.
[02:48:27.980 --> 02:48:32.642]  We'll come back and play some more, but he gets into how the Bush administration is a bunch of bloodthirsty killers.
[02:48:33.743 --> 02:48:36.264]  And he shows how they're all controlled by Trotskyites.
[02:48:37.082 --> 02:48:40.105]  And we're not saying they're communists, the point is they're control freaks.
[02:48:41.187 --> 02:48:49.716]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:50.097 --> 02:48:57.705]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:58.419 --> 02:49:05.462]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:05.862 --> 02:49:17.286]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:17.606 --> 02:49:21.528]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:21.568 --> 02:49:23.508]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:23.828 --> 02:49:27.670]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:00.792 --> 02:52:02.834]  It's not even depression.
[02:52:03.134 --> 02:52:04.616]  I'm very happy in my life.
[02:52:06.357 --> 02:52:08.119]  I'm just sick of the New World Order, man.
[02:52:08.219 --> 02:52:10.982]  I just... I don't even hate them anymore.
[02:52:11.002 --> 02:52:12.403]  I'm just disgusted by them.
[02:52:13.384 --> 02:52:14.465]  I'm just disgusted.
[02:52:14.525 --> 02:52:15.767]  I mean, and it's stupid!
[02:52:16.360 --> 02:52:18.641]  How could anybody not see what's going on?
[02:52:19.021 --> 02:52:24.143]  They're openly setting up a world government, a world taxation system, total micromanagement.
[02:52:24.623 --> 02:52:25.724]  It's horrible!
[02:52:26.844 --> 02:52:28.865]  It's absolutely horrible!
[02:52:30.586 --> 02:52:32.266]  Let's just roll out to the end of the show.
[02:52:32.406 --> 02:52:32.867]  You know what?
[02:52:32.987 --> 02:52:33.827]  It doesn't make sense.
[02:52:33.847 --> 02:52:36.068]  I've got to look at my schedule.
[02:52:37.008 --> 02:52:40.290]  But I promise you, we will air the entire Ron Paul speech tomorrow.
[02:52:40.310 --> 02:52:44.932]  Because I got the speech this morning, and I thought, oh, we'll play part of it, and then I started listening to it.
[02:52:44.952 --> 02:52:45.892]  It's not going to make sense.
[02:52:46.667 --> 02:52:55.031]  Because it really heats up and gets good by the end where Ron Paul goes over everything.
[02:52:55.051 --> 02:52:56.852]  He's officially announced for President now.
[02:52:56.872 --> 02:53:04.075]  Now he can take contributions and do promotions and send you yard signs.
[02:53:04.095 --> 02:53:08.357]  We're going to be getting him on for a full hour here real soon to take your questions.
[02:53:10.098 --> 02:53:14.760]  We've got a lot of other big guests lined up for you this week and throughout the next few weeks.
[02:53:18.837 --> 02:53:24.499]  I don't know.
[02:53:26.119 --> 02:53:28.380]  I've been going to the gym, too, the last week.
[02:53:28.660 --> 02:53:30.201]  It's been making me really aggressive.
[02:53:30.221 --> 02:53:40.544]  I don't want to sit here and talk about myself, but I felt like attacking the microphone a couple times today when people are just frustrating me.
[02:53:40.564 --> 02:53:45.525]  Because I know, including myself, I frustrate myself more than anybody frustrates me.
[02:53:46.144 --> 02:53:50.347]  Because I hear people talking most of the time, and I know the listeners don't know what they're talking about.
[02:53:52.268 --> 02:53:53.849]  Because they're not given specifics.
[02:53:53.929 --> 02:53:55.090]  And it's just frustrating.
[02:53:55.110 --> 02:54:11.760]  And then somebody says something, and I want to go off into 10 different points on that, and then they say something else I want to talk about, and I want to go off into 10 different points on that, and I just don't even know what to get into next, and there's just too much evidence, and there's a giant stack of news here in front of me.
[02:54:12.840 --> 02:54:15.142]  We got to quite a bit of it, but not that much of it.
[02:54:18.337 --> 02:54:26.624]  I mean the Mexican President saying we need to do more for Mexico and saying we need total amnesty and griping about that fence.
[02:54:26.704 --> 02:54:27.565]  That's all theater.
[02:54:27.585 --> 02:54:28.946]  They know that fence isn't to be built.
[02:54:28.966 --> 02:54:30.327]  They're building a few miles of it.
[02:54:30.708 --> 02:54:31.808]  It's a complete joke.
[02:54:34.831 --> 02:54:35.852]  It's just incredible.
[02:54:37.879 --> 02:54:41.421]  And Alberto Gonzales fired these U.S.
[02:54:41.461 --> 02:54:44.322]  Attorneys because they wouldn't shut up Democratic candidates.
[02:54:44.742 --> 02:54:50.785]  That's the issue, not that, oh, well Hillary fired everybody, isn't she a hypocrite?
[02:54:51.045 --> 02:54:52.105]  Yeah, she's a crook.
[02:54:53.226 --> 02:54:54.787]  What's wrong with you conservatives?
[02:54:55.127 --> 02:55:01.870]  Just because she's a crook, it makes it okay for Alberto Metrola Raza Gonzales to be a crook?
[02:55:07.535 --> 02:55:13.200]  I mean, really, it's almost an insult to everybody's intelligence to have to go over evidence of this stuff.
[02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:16.863]  I'm just getting to the point of, like, why should we even keep proving anything?
[02:55:17.163 --> 02:55:17.484]  Why?
[02:55:17.744 --> 02:55:18.605]  What is the point?
[02:55:21.587 --> 02:55:22.608]  What is the point?
[02:55:23.769 --> 02:55:27.292]  And I guess I get depressed just by how fallen mankind is.
[02:55:29.034 --> 02:55:35.099]  No matter what government, what group, I guess it all does come down to God, and we just gotta ask God to change us on the inside.
[02:55:38.297 --> 02:55:39.098]  It's unbelievable.
[02:55:39.918 --> 02:55:43.501]  Alright, I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, on the network, GCN.
[02:55:43.881 --> 02:55:45.882]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, live.
[02:55:45.942 --> 02:55:47.804]  I will air the entire Ron Paul speech.
[02:55:48.384 --> 02:55:49.525]  I know I've got some guests tomorrow.
[02:55:49.565 --> 02:55:50.606]  I'll just cancel them.
[02:55:51.866 --> 02:55:55.149]  And, uh, a lot more.
[02:55:55.649 --> 02:55:57.050]  Man, I don't have time to plug the films.
[02:55:57.490 --> 02:55:58.311]  That's how you support us.
[02:55:58.331 --> 02:55:59.512]  That's how we do what we do here.
[02:55:59.832 --> 02:56:00.873]  Plus, they're great videos.
[02:56:00.893 --> 02:56:01.713]  We carry a lot of them.
[02:56:02.254 --> 02:56:03.895]  They're available at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:03.935 --> 02:56:05.456]  Or you can just give up and let them win.
[02:56:06.494 --> 02:56:15.398]  Just take the vaccines and decide they're healthy, and enjoy your child dying of leukemia at 10, and just drink the mercury, and just love government, love the devil, and love everything else.
[02:56:15.418 --> 02:56:16.798]  All right, take care.
[02:56:16.858 --> 02:56:17.258]  Bye-bye.
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:25.822]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNLive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[02:56:25.842 --> 02:56:25.942]  What?
