[00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.406]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.067 --> 00:00:08.148]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:09.949]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:11.409]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.091]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:17.353]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:21.976]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.827]  Every day, the broadcasts get more and more important.
[00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:33.750]  The news becomes more and more frequent in its vital import as well.
[00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:50.096]  We have a guest coming on, a doctor, to discuss the attack on vitamin supplements, freedom, basic vitamins, the Codex Alimentarius, European-style eradication of health foods, now in the U.S.
[00:00:50.336 --> 00:00:50.696]  Senate.
[00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:58.966]  That guest will be almost about 15 minutes, a mini guest, in the third hour.
[00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:19.910]  In the second hour, I've got two young Christian ministers, pastors, lay pastors, whatever you want to call them, who are walking across the United States, and literally every couple miles, the police stop them and ask for their papers and IDs.
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.241]  Because they have signs that say real Christians don't seek war.
[00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:31.243]  And here in America, you're not supposed to do that.
[00:01:31.683 --> 00:01:34.144]  So they're also shattering the illusion of freedom.
[00:01:34.584 --> 00:01:38.245]  You see, to get the freedom back, we have to admit what we've lost.
[00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:45.407]  Kind of like if you've got a compound fracture, you're not going to walk again until you go in and get that mended and get that fixed.
[00:01:45.427 --> 00:01:50.028]  You keep trying to walk on it, you'll get gangrene and it'll just rot off and you'll die.
[00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:55.395]  And the country's got two compound fractures and both our arms cut off.
[00:01:56.296 --> 00:02:04.364]  And the New World Order is busy slitting our throat right now and I think we need to go ahead and admit up to that so we can get things fixed before it's too late.
[00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:10.730]  Alright, let me just tell you about some of the news I've got here in the stack in front of me.
[00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:15.147]  I'm getting more and more frustrated because I do cover some of the news but not all of it.
[00:02:15.807 --> 00:02:23.854]  Because I want to detail each report and I look up and one story is taking 30 minutes to cover and to make all the connections and to connect the dots as they say.
[00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:29.038]  Gasoline prices could hit records this month, AAA says.
[00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:36.404]  They're talking about going well above $3 for a national average and well above $4 in many areas of the nation.
[00:02:38.406 --> 00:02:41.128]  We have a top British general
[00:02:42.285 --> 00:02:46.548]  saying the insurgents have a right to take on U.S.
[00:02:46.648 --> 00:02:47.989]  forces and fight back.
[00:02:50.891 --> 00:02:54.894]  Also, a House fails to overturn war spending veto.
[00:02:54.954 --> 00:02:57.336]  I'm going to cover a lot of news on the war when we get back.
[00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:01.179]  It's really a war on America's name and our treasury.
[00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:05.061]  That's right, the war is not really about Iraq.
[00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:07.223]  That's a very small caveat or
[00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.011]  We're good to go.
[00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:37.134]  ABC's Paul Harvey compares women and children killed in Afghanistan to 9-11 hijackers.
[00:03:37.174 --> 00:03:38.234]  We have the actual clip.
[00:03:38.915 --> 00:03:52.581]  What was he, he did a few years ago, he said we had to stop being like a bunch of candy, candy asses, I think he said, and go ahead and just start nuking and killing everyone because we weren't made out of sugar candy.
[00:03:55.988 --> 00:03:56.848]  Also, U.S.
[00:03:56.888 --> 00:04:02.371]  may be keeping tactical nukes at airbase outside Iran for the attack.
[00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:04.792]  I'm sure that will pleasure a lot of people out there.
[00:04:04.812 --> 00:04:08.553]  That's a psychological pleasuring ground for you to feel manly.
[00:04:09.654 --> 00:04:15.436]  Of course, you can't find Iran or Persia on a map, but it does sound powerful, doesn't it, to impotent people?
[00:04:15.456 --> 00:04:23.500]  Of course, those seething with manhood don't like to go around abusing weak people, but those who don't have manhood do.
[00:04:24.652 --> 00:04:30.116]  Um, continuing, Army squeezes soldier blogs, maybe to death.
[00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:40.524]  Um, RFK immediately thought Brother's assassination was a conspiracy of government black-op.
[00:04:40.884 --> 00:04:42.846]  This out of Salon Magazine.
[00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:47.129]  Huge report, son of JFK conspirator dropped a new bombshell, revelations.
[00:04:48.624 --> 00:04:54.768]  We'll tell you about a brave soul that fought to the death against two pet bulls who were menacing children.
[00:04:54.788 --> 00:04:56.188]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:08.355]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:08.736 --> 00:05:16.340]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:17.054 --> 00:05:24.116]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:24.496 --> 00:05:35.938]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:39.759]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.120]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.321]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:03.493]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:04.053]  are located?
[00:06:04.254 --> 00:06:07.638]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:06:07.858 --> 00:06:12.563]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:06:12.864 --> 00:06:19.792]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas, brewing environmental catastrophes,
[00:06:20.032 --> 00:06:24.134]  The safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.
[00:06:24.415 --> 00:06:37.722]  Complete with three gigabytes of detailed information on each of 3,000 plus counties in the US, including 550 high-resolution full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis to help you zero in on
[00:06:37.722 --> 00:06:38.203]  We're good to go.
[00:06:59.802 --> 00:07:06.305]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:10.547]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[00:07:10.807 --> 00:07:12.948]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[00:07:13.328 --> 00:07:15.429]  All Natural Non-X clears out the source of
[00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.849]  I think so.
[00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:49.286]  In the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[00:07:49.746 --> 00:07:52.047]  Or online at drugstore.com.
[00:07:52.468 --> 00:07:57.851]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:04.254]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:04.635 --> 00:08:06.896]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:12.077 --> 00:08:16.242]  Just two program notes here.
[00:08:16.322 --> 00:08:17.704]  My program notes.
[00:08:17.824 --> 00:08:18.825]  It's important that
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:46.190]  We consciously take notice of this because it really is an effective part of the resistance against the world organized crime syndicate operating planet-wide against the remnants of free humanity.
[00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:58.198]  We have a free podcast of this radio show served out at the end of the live broadcast every day at two o'clock central to your MP3 or iPod device.
[00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.461]  You go to InfoWars.com if you're online

[00:09:26.284 --> 00:09:27.804]  I just know how to subscribe to it.
[00:09:30.484 --> 00:09:33.105]  So that is available and I know a lot of you are using it.

[00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:56.516]  They have a lot of car stereo systems now that have mp3 players on them and that have data banks so you can load it onto there and listen in your car or your 18-wheeler.
[00:10:00.396 --> 00:10:17.644]  Let's say you're a truck driver, you can, when you get back in a week from hauling your load from, say, Texas to New York, you can just plug your iPod in and download the whole last week, and then listen again how you want, when you want, where you want.

[00:10:23.127 --> 00:10:26.689]  And then, of course, we have free streams when the live show ends at 2 o'clock Central.
[00:10:27.483 --> 00:10:34.229]  The other 21 hours out of the day, we restream the three hours consecutively, back to back, over and over again.
[00:10:34.249 --> 00:10:42.816]  So you can listen at 8 o'clock in the morning, or at 1 o'clock in the morning, or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, 7 o'clock at night.
[00:10:42.836 --> 00:10:44.918]  Whenever you wish, you can tune in.
[00:10:45.178 --> 00:10:49.462]  It's all about getting the information out there, because we know it's a busy world.
[00:10:49.962 --> 00:10:55.167]  Alright, that said, let me get into two little news items that I never commented on.
[00:10:56.673 --> 00:11:24.578]  I was out in California when Boris Yeltsin died, or to be technical, I had just flown back, and I was distracted with all sorts of local ninnying when I returned, and so I'm always digging through stacks in the last week or two of news, and oh my gosh, I didn't cover that, oh my gosh, I didn't cover this, so a lot of times we'll get to news I didn't cover here at the start of the show, you know, in another show.
[00:11:25.788 --> 00:11:27.228]  And here we are on that other show.
[00:11:28.809 --> 00:11:42.552]  Number one, Boris Yeltsin, there was certainly a lot of stage-managed activities going on with that, but I believe Boris Yeltsin himself was legitimately trying to bring in reforms.
[00:11:43.492 --> 00:11:52.234]  It's even in the mainstream histories now that George Bush Senior tried to actually help the
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:12:00.622]  Former leader of that nation, a so-called reformer, Mikhail Gorbachev, stay in power.
[00:12:01.022 --> 00:12:03.103]  The Russian system was falling apart.
[00:12:03.563 --> 00:12:07.124]  The people, the police, the military, were not going along with the Soviet system.
[00:12:08.304 --> 00:12:17.747]  So they were trying to come in with a form of Soviet light, because that entire nation was always on by the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, and that's now come out
[00:12:19.474 --> 00:12:37.962]  Then the Financial Times of London and other publications, every time Putin arrests some oligarch, we learn that the stock secretly reverts to one of the Rothschild family members in two of the main ones in England.
[00:12:38.802 --> 00:12:45.605]  There's Baron Rothschild, there's Lord Rothschild, then of course there's the French Rothschild family.
[00:12:48.021 --> 00:12:49.582]  And it reverts right back to them.
[00:12:51.524 --> 00:13:01.071]  And so they were having trouble with some of the old line Soviets, and they were having trouble with some of the new rising officer classes in the military.
[00:13:02.132 --> 00:13:07.776]  And so they basically wanted to kind of phase it out for a merger into the European Union later.
[00:13:07.796 --> 00:13:10.178]  And it wasn't going too well.
[00:13:11.019 --> 00:13:17.624]  But Yeltsin popped up at the right time, and of course you know about the fact that he got up on top of the tank, and the military was coming.
[00:13:18.869 --> 00:13:36.184]  But then the military refused to fire on him and the people saw his courage and it resonated with the Russian population and then in shorthand he handed everything over to the six oligarchs right back to the original owners of who'd always owned the Soviet Union to begin with.
[00:13:39.927 --> 00:13:45.892]  And then in 1993 they tried to overthrow him but couldn't get the votes but the Duma still tried it
[00:13:47.245 --> 00:13:50.026]  He still had the remnants of the Soviet structure in place.
[00:13:50.627 --> 00:13:56.989]  That didn't work, and so he had to shell the Parliament and the Russian White House.
[00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:04.153]  Remember those visual images of tanks at 300 yards firing their main guns into the structure?
[00:14:04.693 --> 00:14:05.693]  Very spectacular.
[00:14:10.255 --> 00:14:15.518]  And then Yeltsin, who had always been admittedly a heavy drinker,
[00:14:16.653 --> 00:14:23.419]  Retreated into lethargy and public spectacles of dementia.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.624]  Now, it may have been like Reagan, where you have Putin sneaking around and drugging him, and there was a lot of evidence to that.
[00:14:28.664 --> 00:14:32.507]  And then, of course, they launched an operation in breakaway Republic of Chechnya.
[00:14:32.527 --> 00:14:39.133]  Then Putin staged terror attacks in 99, when he was vice president, to then become president.
[00:14:40.214 --> 00:14:41.936]  He was unpopular and was going to lose.
[00:14:43.644 --> 00:14:53.491]  Had around 30% approval ratings, but after the Chechens blew up three buildings, of course, Moscow, a suburb of Moscow, police caught FSB planting bombs.
[00:14:55.152 --> 00:15:08.202]  But after the bombs, everyone rallied around Putin to save them from the Muslim extremists, who didn't exist, that is, behind the bombings, and Putin came in on a wave of public support.
[00:15:09.483 --> 00:15:10.804]  And he's been there ever since.
[00:15:12.941 --> 00:15:37.817]  for the last seven plus years but uh... the reason I wanted to raise the point about Boris Yeltsin was regardless of what really happened there it's that image of the lone leader standing up with the people at first just a few thousand against tens of thousands of troops massed against them and saying go ahead and open fire on us
[00:15:38.809 --> 00:15:46.698]  And the Supreme Soviet blinking because they knew it would blow up in their face in open, shitty, burning rebellion.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.404]  Because they knew that the government itself wasn't going to go along with it.
[00:15:51.824 --> 00:15:57.331]  And it was the same thing with Ceausescu a few years before that in Romania.
[00:15:58.251 --> 00:16:09.999]  I mean, this guy had cameras on every street corner, spies everywhere, secret police arresting people in the middle of the night, gulags, torture, trainloads of people going to Siberia and the forced labor camps.
[00:16:13.342 --> 00:16:24.570]  And just suddenly one day, the police beat up the wrong person in the street, the people started fighting back against the police, other police didn't join in to help because they were sick of it and living like dogs themselves.
[00:16:25.835 --> 00:16:28.336]  You know, the power trip had burned out a long time ago.
[00:16:28.356 --> 00:16:31.416]  They'd found out how hollow that petty power trip was.
[00:16:31.776 --> 00:16:33.097]  Our police haven't yet discovered it.
[00:16:34.277 --> 00:16:47.960]  And then just suddenly, in the time period of less than two days, Ceausescu was hanging dead in the streets, along with his disgusting New World Order wife.
[00:16:51.547 --> 00:16:52.608]  And that's how it happens.
[00:16:52.648 --> 00:16:54.109]  It happens real quick.
[00:16:54.489 --> 00:16:59.333]  That's why smart elites learned how to have invisible empires behind the throne.
[00:16:59.353 --> 00:17:02.656]  The British learned to take down their flag over a hundred years ago.
[00:17:02.976 --> 00:17:04.177]  They learned to put puppets in.
[00:17:04.197 --> 00:17:07.400]  They learned to give the illusion of freedom, the illusion of choice.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.801]  And that's what we now have here today.
[00:17:09.101 --> 00:17:21.011]  But for some reason, the elites decided to get really greedy and go for everything and try to snatch everyone's children and build prisons everywhere and put the cops in black Nazi outfits and cameras everywhere.
[00:17:22.299 --> 00:17:28.183]  Because they decided they're going to go ahead and pop the bubble, consolidate everything, and they think they can handle it when you riot.
[00:17:28.603 --> 00:17:30.405]  They think they can handle it when you fight back.
[00:17:32.986 --> 00:17:51.739]  And so I'm here trying to wake up as many people as I can, so they understand the real paradigm, so that the globalists will test the water, or check the wind direction, basically, and decide, test the winds of fortune, and decide that, hey, we better not go ahead with this.
[00:17:52.768 --> 00:18:04.812]  Then we've got them in a stalemate where it's just slow tyranny and we can more effectively maneuver and defeat them and remove them and back them down and teach the people that they do have power and that they can resist.
[00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:14.936]  So we're trying to do a holding action, ladies and gentlemen, a holding action to weaken and sap the enemy forces while we build our forces.
[00:18:15.953 --> 00:18:18.113]  It's kind of like the Alamo, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:18.454 --> 00:18:28.576]  We're here, 180-something, those of us that are actually involved, which it's millions of us, but comparatively it is like 180, against the huge forces of the New World Order.
[00:18:29.056 --> 00:18:38.338]  We know, and the New World Order knows, that if they take us and publicly rip us to pieces in front of everyone, they will look like those pit bulls that killed that
[00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:45.983]  Jack Russell in New Zealand, and they will then be put down like those pit bulls were today.
[00:18:47.564 --> 00:18:48.665]  You see, they understand that.
[00:18:49.305 --> 00:18:58.250]  And so here we are, the 160, 186, saying, come on, bring it on, run over the top of us.
[00:18:59.391 --> 00:19:02.553]  Literally, that's what it takes to win wars, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:02.973 --> 00:19:07.256]  That's the spirit that you have to have and the focus.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.381]  That you have to have to beat these people.
[00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:13.682]  You have to first know history and understand they can be defeated.
[00:19:14.042 --> 00:19:16.183]  No one is invincible and we've got God on our side.
[00:19:16.664 --> 00:19:19.205]  You've got to then know it's your duty regardless to fight them.
[00:19:19.405 --> 00:19:26.127]  You've got to understand that even if we lose, it's better than laying on our bellies licking their boots.
[00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:34.211]  And so, take that image of Boris Yeltsin up on top of that tank.
[00:19:36.332 --> 00:19:37.072]  And understand,
[00:19:38.556 --> 00:19:52.625]  That every time they crushed us, every time they whacked Mahatma Gandhi upside the head with a big old stick, he only got stronger and the people only got stronger.
[00:19:53.245 --> 00:19:54.866]  It's the same lesson here.
[00:19:55.467 --> 00:19:57.548]  We'll be back to tell you about the Jack Russell Terrier.
[00:20:01.627 --> 00:20:02.668]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:02.988 --> 00:20:05.770]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:10.192]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:10.632 --> 00:20:11.453]  So what do you do?
[00:20:11.773 --> 00:20:16.336]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:16.836 --> 00:20:18.958]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:20:51.037 --> 00:20:54.078]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:06.753 --> 00:21:11.576]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:11.777 --> 00:21:14.519]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:15.679]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:21.623]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:22.544 --> 00:21:29.809]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.852]  Midas Resources is offering the red buck and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:35.999 --> 00:21:39.462]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:21:40.442 --> 00:21:41.723]  Call for your copy today.
[00:21:41.964 --> 00:21:44.165]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.226 --> 00:21:51.070]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:21:51.771 --> 00:21:52.171]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.231 --> 00:21:52.431]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.774 --> 00:22:02.836]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:03.457 --> 00:22:12.385]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:12.826 --> 00:22:20.033]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:20.746 --> 00:22:26.252]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:22:26.732 --> 00:22:37.583]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.

[00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:49.250]  We're good.
[00:23:00.436 --> 00:23:11.444]  JLS Research, the makers of all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[00:23:11.644 --> 00:23:18.149]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[00:23:18.329 --> 00:23:25.975]  By using organics and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[00:23:26.215 --> 00:23:26.916]  As it responds,
[00:23:27.176 --> 00:23:29.198]  Body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[00:23:29.478 --> 00:23:32.981]  First Responder is the first of its kind, comprised of only four organics.
[00:23:33.301 --> 00:23:36.564]  Grape seed skins, grape seed, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[00:23:36.925 --> 00:23:41.429]  It's so effective you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[00:23:41.729 --> 00:23:44.231]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[00:23:44.531 --> 00:23:48.014]  Go online and order First Responder at No-BO.com.
[00:23:48.235 --> 00:23:51.578]  Visit No-BO.com or call JLS Research at 850-723-8599.
[00:23:55.081 --> 00:23:57.022]  That's 850-723-8599.
[00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:06.710]  And the hundred and eighty were challenged by Travis to die.
[00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:14.696]  By the line that he drew with his sword when the battle was nigh.
[00:24:15.337 --> 00:24:21.742]  Any man that would fight to the death cross over, but him that would live better fly.
[00:24:23.067 --> 00:24:27.588]  And over the line, what a hundred and seventy-nine.
[00:24:27.608 --> 00:24:34.970]  Hey, Santa Ana, we're killing your soldiers below.
[00:24:35.831 --> 00:24:41.792]  That man, wherever they go, will remember the Alamo.
[00:24:48.816 --> 00:24:53.180]  Bowie lay dying, but his powder was ready and dry.
[00:24:55.922 --> 00:25:00.486]  The lad on his back, Bowie killed him a few in reply.
[00:25:03.088 --> 00:25:09.753]  And young David Crockett was singing and laughing with gallantry fierce in his eye.
[00:25:10.674 --> 00:25:15.638]  For God and for freedom, a man more than willing to die.
[00:25:18.516 --> 00:25:22.757]  Hey, Santa Ana, we're killing your soldiers below.
[00:25:23.737 --> 00:25:29.959]  That men, wherever they go, will remember the Alamo.
[00:25:31.239 --> 00:25:31.819]  Welcome back.
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.660]  Interesting little story.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.780]  And then they sent a young scout.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.061]  And I mentioned it earlier.
[00:25:39.101 --> 00:25:45.042]  Boris Yeltsin standing up against the tanks, or what happened with Ceausescu, just saying no.
[00:25:46.548 --> 00:25:49.150]  Pointing out the insanity of the system.
[00:25:50.491 --> 00:25:53.393]  And he'll be remembered for standing up on top of that tank.
[00:25:53.433 --> 00:26:00.137]  He won't be remembered for having strokes and being in la-la land.
[00:26:01.798 --> 00:26:05.881]  Pit bulls to be put down today after killing heroic Jack Russell.
[00:26:07.062 --> 00:26:08.403]  Two pit bulls will be put down.
[00:26:09.375 --> 00:26:15.017]  In the township after they mauled to death a Jack Russell that had jumped to the rescue of a group of children.
[00:26:15.077 --> 00:26:22.180]  The pet terrier called George had to be put down after he was so badly injured by the dogs on Sunday.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.140]  We just now learned about this last night.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.442]  It's just now making news here in the United States and England.
[00:26:28.942 --> 00:26:36.105]  And the children were... I guess it's a different world in New Zealand where children can still walk to the candy shop from ages 4 to 11.
[00:26:38.092 --> 00:26:42.174]  We're walking to the candy shop and here come the two pit bulls rushing them.
[00:26:43.094 --> 00:26:47.256]  And I mean every week it seems like I read about a pit bull killing or mauling some child.
[00:26:48.276 --> 00:26:53.358]  Let me just tell you, ladies and gentlemen, if your pit bull ever does anything to my children, you're not going to have to wait for the police to come.
[00:26:55.999 --> 00:26:58.300]  Let me just give you that little news flash.
[00:27:00.701 --> 00:27:02.042]  I'm going to comment on that in a moment.
[00:27:03.357 --> 00:27:25.116]  And the pet terrier called George had to be put down and it goes on to say that they savagely ripped open his neck and back and but he continued to fight them and the dog did rush in of course to attack the dogs the smallest four-year-old they like to eat small children do it routinely and I don't want to hear your bull about their nice dogs okay they're bred to fight and bred to attack people
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:53.614]  and I was just walking along down the street a week ago and I'm not afraid of dogs and you know normally you're not even consciously afraid of dogs they ignore you and you just I don't really pay attention I like dogs I wave at them and this pit bull took a snap at my hand and the person started laughing about it I didn't say anything I wanted to say hey I'll break your dog's neck and then I'll knock your teeth out you know I am tired of these people who think their dog is their extension
[00:27:54.415 --> 00:27:55.195]  of their manhood.
[00:27:55.235 --> 00:28:08.218]  You know, you try to go down the hike and bike trail and there'll be these white trash people or you know other scum out there with their pit bull with the spike collar and they're walking around with it dragging them and they're looking at you like you're scared.
[00:28:08.478 --> 00:28:09.458]  No, I'm not scared.
[00:28:09.758 --> 00:28:11.959]  When someone menaces me I want to attack you.
[00:28:12.219 --> 00:28:13.039]  Do you understand?
[00:28:13.059 --> 00:28:17.880]  I don't like, I want to go look at the trees and fish jumping in the river.
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:22.241]  I don't want to think about what I'm going to do to your dog if it comes over and bites me.
[00:28:23.248 --> 00:28:24.489]  And how the police are going to come.
[00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:28.893]  Because you're going to jump on me when I'm stomping your dog and then I'm going to punch you in the neck.
[00:28:29.994 --> 00:28:31.375]  And then you're going to go to the hospital.
[00:28:33.557 --> 00:28:35.158]  I don't like having to be violent.
[00:28:35.418 --> 00:28:39.762]  I don't like violent scum everywhere with their dogs running around killing kids.
[00:28:41.643 --> 00:28:45.626]  And it's such a fad to have a pit bull and so much fun to have them.
[00:28:45.867 --> 00:28:49.530]  Well I got small children and I know they like to go after kids and I'm just telling you.
[00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.152]  Keep your dog on a leash and keep it in your house.
[00:28:53.627 --> 00:29:01.251]  Because I'm getting sick and tired of every week hearing about your dogs mauling or killing children or attacking joggers and attacking women.
[00:29:01.571 --> 00:29:03.052]  You're white trash scum!
[00:29:05.633 --> 00:29:12.636]  This dog is bred, just like a dachshund's bred to go down a hole and kill badgers, but it likes its owners and it's a sweet dog?
[00:29:12.656 --> 00:29:16.358]  Or just like a greyhound is bred to run and race?
[00:29:18.165 --> 00:29:21.688]  These types of dogs are trained to attack people.
[00:29:22.029 --> 00:29:23.870]  They're trained to attack other dogs.
[00:29:24.791 --> 00:29:25.151]  Okay?
[00:29:25.572 --> 00:29:28.054]  And again, a lot of us aren't impotent like you.
[00:29:28.494 --> 00:29:30.596]  We have to hold back our aggression.
[00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:32.117]  We try to be civilized.
[00:29:32.598 --> 00:29:38.002]  And we don't like chicken necks like you with your dogs menacing us.
[00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:41.265]  You need to have your teeth knocked out is what needs to happen.
[00:29:49.714 --> 00:29:52.716]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.616 --> 00:29:56.398]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.739 --> 00:30:04.682]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[00:30:05.002 --> 00:30:06.903]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:30:07.083 --> 00:30:10.145]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:30:10.305 --> 00:30:13.447]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:30:13.747 --> 00:30:15.608]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[00:30:15.868 --> 00:30:19.570]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.511]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible!
[00:30:23.131 --> 00:30:27.393]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:30:27.633 --> 00:30:31.915]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:30:32.315 --> 00:30:36.657]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, the unholy alliance.

[00:30:47.722 --> 00:30:50.143]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[00:30:50.363 --> 00:30:50.844]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:30:50.864 --> 00:30:51.384]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:30:51.404 --> 00:30:51.964]  And ask for Packet B.
[00:30:59.798 --> 00:31:06.900]  Craig Walcott, chartered financial consultant and host of the Dead Doctors Don't Lie radio program and million-dollar earner in the network marketing field since 1989.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.061]  I certainly know what it takes to succeed.
[00:31:09.301 --> 00:31:14.742]  I also know without proper tools, your chance for significant income in the network marketing field can quickly fade.
[00:31:14.942 --> 00:31:20.864]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing will never spend the time nor money to develop the skills they need.
[00:31:21.124 --> 00:31:23.565]  That's where MLM Incorporated steps in.
[00:31:23.766 --> 00:31:30.589]  No matter what network marketing venture you're involved in, MLM Incorporated can provide you the successful tools you need to truly succeed.

[00:31:59.548 --> 00:32:00.148]  It's a fact.
[00:32:00.328 --> 00:32:04.771]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:32:05.111 --> 00:32:10.314]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[00:32:10.574 --> 00:32:13.795]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[00:32:14.035 --> 00:32:21.179]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:28.683]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[00:32:28.943 --> 00:32:31.045]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[00:32:31.445 --> 00:32:37.769]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[00:32:38.009 --> 00:32:41.812]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[00:32:42.132 --> 00:32:44.714]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.
[00:32:44.754 --> 00:32:45.594]  to 5 p.m.
[00:32:45.634 --> 00:32:47.135]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[00:32:47.195 --> 00:32:47.556]  That's 920-293-8024.
[00:32:47.676 --> 00:32:48.636]  And ask for Robert.
[00:32:48.676 --> 00:32:51.658]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[00:33:04.645 --> 00:33:06.625]  Well, there's calls to fire LUDOFs.
[00:33:06.665 --> 00:33:07.485]  We'll tell you about that.
[00:33:07.545 --> 00:33:08.326]  The war news.
[00:33:08.366 --> 00:33:11.106]  Go through all the latest JFK developments and they're big.
[00:33:11.987 --> 00:33:13.287]  Coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:13.327 --> 00:33:15.128]  Just finishing up with this little Jack Russell.
[00:33:15.608 --> 00:33:27.411]  You can go read the story up on PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or just type into a search engine Jack Russell and literally, I think I saw like 270 something articles on this yesterday when I did a search.
[00:33:29.469 --> 00:33:36.330]  But it charged the children trying to attack the four-year-old, and they always go after, I guess, the smallest prey.
[00:33:37.131 --> 00:33:42.572]  And little Jack Russell ran in, biting them, snapping them, fighting back, and they would bite it and throw it, and it would charge back in.
[00:33:42.612 --> 00:33:44.472]  They had to put the little dog down.
[00:33:44.512 --> 00:33:52.934]  Those are great little dogs, very protective of their family, smart little dogs, not mindless killing machines like pit bulls.
[00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.691]  And look, I don't want to hear that they're nice pit bulls.
[00:33:56.831 --> 00:33:58.432]  I understand they're nice pit bulls.
[00:33:58.492 --> 00:34:01.334]  I understand that you think it's how you raise them.
[00:34:01.774 --> 00:34:11.158]  But there's a lot of people who get them, who think they're nice, and then leave them with their three-year-old to go outside and pick up a package or water the yard.
[00:34:11.178 --> 00:34:17.581]  And they come back in and the kid's dead or dying, especially if there's two of the dogs.
[00:34:18.042 --> 00:34:22.644]  Your two little sweet babies will kill your child or kill the neighbor's children.
[00:34:23.835 --> 00:34:41.561]  And I don't believe in government controlling or regulating or stopping people from having them, but if your dog maims or kills somebody and you didn't have them properly attended to, and I don't mean just snapping at somebody, I mean with specific known breeds of this, that you need to be charged with manslaughter.
[00:34:42.321 --> 00:34:45.222]  And you need to spend some prison time for what you do with these dogs.
[00:34:47.023 --> 00:34:48.043]  But everybody's seen it.
[00:34:49.344 --> 00:34:56.906]  I guess in some areas of the country you don't have people walking around with their pitbulls thinking that it scares everyone.
[00:34:56.926 --> 00:35:01.988]  I mean, it's literally you're menacing people.
[00:35:02.448 --> 00:35:07.390]  It would be like if I was walking around the street with a rifle just randomly pointing it at people.
[00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:12.811]  Don't point your weapon at me and don't sit there and think you're tough.
[00:35:13.631 --> 00:35:15.432]  It's disgusting and you're scum.
[00:35:16.874 --> 00:35:18.415]  You're absolute scum!
[00:35:18.995 --> 00:35:27.701]  You've got a dog that's genetic breeding, has it extremely predisposed to attack children.
[00:35:29.142 --> 00:35:33.845]  And they kill and maim a lot of children, and I am sick of it, and I am tired of it.
[00:35:37.047 --> 00:35:41.970]  I said I'd get into this article, but again, you can just go read it up on the website.
[00:35:44.651 --> 00:35:45.472]  If you want to read about it.
[00:35:47.469 --> 00:35:51.431]  I mean, how many people have to get killed by these dogs, and it is the fault of the owner?
[00:35:51.871 --> 00:35:55.812]  Hey, if you want your fighting dog, keep it in your backyard.
[00:35:55.992 --> 00:35:57.133]  Don't let it dig out.
[00:35:57.453 --> 00:36:00.354]  But see, it's always scum that has these dogs.
[00:36:00.914 --> 00:36:05.496]  The people that are nice, who have Labrador Retrievers, or who have German Shepherds.
[00:36:05.996 --> 00:36:07.457]  You can even have an aggressive animal.
[00:36:08.172 --> 00:36:12.297]  You don't see German Shepherds running around just randomly trying to kill children.
[00:36:12.558 --> 00:36:14.400]  No, if you come in the backyard they'll kill you.
[00:36:14.821 --> 00:36:15.742]  Or they'll try to kill you.
[00:36:16.403 --> 00:36:18.165]  They're trained to guard.
[00:36:18.745 --> 00:36:20.888]  They're trained to attack on orders.
[00:36:21.269 --> 00:36:24.433]  They're not mindless idiot animals.
[00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:27.910]  And again, bottom line, you want to have a wolf?
[00:36:28.491 --> 00:36:30.251]  Keep your wolf on a leash.
[00:36:30.511 --> 00:36:31.651]  Don't let it out.
[00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:38.372]  Don't laugh at your wolf as it runs around attacking other dogs at the green belt as I've witnessed people with their wolves.
[00:36:40.953 --> 00:36:52.715]  I mean, if you want to be tough and be manly, go get into kickboxing or jujitsu or go join a local boxing club in your inner city and we'll see how tough you are when those people go in there and ring your bell.
[00:36:53.769 --> 00:36:56.631]  Don't go around menacing us with your dogs!
[00:36:56.651 --> 00:37:14.142]  You know, I've never talked about that, but it just, it literally makes my blood boil when you see somebody walking with one of these pit bulls, and it's dragging them, and they're bugging their eyes out, looking at everyone on a power trip.
[00:37:14.763 --> 00:37:16.664]  I mean, it's also just embarrassing.
[00:37:16.964 --> 00:37:18.185]  I'm embarrassed for you.
[00:37:22.233 --> 00:37:23.753]  I mean, I really am embarrassed for you.
[00:37:25.894 --> 00:37:30.054]  Little children being chewed up by wild animals gets my instincts going.
[00:37:31.415 --> 00:37:39.536]  I mean, that is the total defense instinct in me, is the archetypal image of something with big teeth biting the young.
[00:37:40.536 --> 00:37:43.897]  And so I see you as a potential threat, and I want to physically attack you.
[00:37:44.217 --> 00:37:45.417]  I mean, frankly, I'll just be honest.
[00:37:45.477 --> 00:37:49.578]  I see people like that on the streets, and I really just hope your dog will do something.
[00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.291]  Again, I'm not like that normally.
[00:37:53.391 --> 00:37:54.971]  I'm not looking for trouble.
[00:37:55.351 --> 00:37:56.232]  Do you understand that?
[00:37:56.572 --> 00:37:57.472]  Just like with the government.
[00:37:57.632 --> 00:37:59.773]  We're not looking for trouble from you, scum!
[00:38:01.053 --> 00:38:04.014]  You pack of baboons, as I heard one talk show host call you.
[00:38:04.634 --> 00:38:05.955]  Just leave us alone!
[00:38:06.275 --> 00:38:07.095]  Leave us alone!
[00:38:07.135 --> 00:38:08.255]  Let us live our lives!
[00:38:08.275 --> 00:38:12.957]  Alright, I got a bunch of news and I'm already digressing for 20 minutes on dogs, but...
[00:38:16.784 --> 00:38:24.549]  By the way, they're now going to put out an adult warning on serotonin reuptake inhibitors of how it increases suicide and violent tendencies.
[00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:27.151]  We don't need your warning.
[00:38:27.171 --> 00:38:29.653]  You know, FinFin causes a few heart attacks.
[00:38:32.155 --> 00:38:45.164]  Other drugs cause a few heart problems and they ban them, but every time a woman does something horrible, grounds her children, cuts their arms off, every time there's a mass shooter, they're on this stuff, it admittedly is a hallucinogen and puts you into a state.
[00:38:46.403 --> 00:38:48.486]  Where when you have a bad trip, bad things happen.
[00:38:48.787 --> 00:38:50.149]  People jump out of windows.
[00:38:50.189 --> 00:38:51.250]  They commit suicide.
[00:38:51.591 --> 00:38:52.552]  They kill their children.
[00:38:52.572 --> 00:38:55.196]  And it's always these drugs.
[00:38:55.236 --> 00:38:56.899]  They should be banned last week.
[00:38:57.452 --> 00:38:58.352]  But that's not going to happen.
[00:38:58.712 --> 00:39:13.576]  New Freedom Initiative, we have the documents, came out of Ohio three years ago, right before it got approved, when even some of their own board members went public that the drug company said, we've got 15 percent, we have the documents, we're going to get half the kids on these drugs now, and it's already begun.
[00:39:13.636 --> 00:39:20.297]  So they use the shootings that the drugs certainly contribute to massively.
[00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:23.118]  I would say a prime contributing figure.
[00:39:26.988 --> 00:39:28.970]  We're good to go.
[00:39:49.958 --> 00:39:51.479]  That is the guiding core.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:53.981]  That is the universe for the New World Order.
[00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:58.625]  They are habitual, just like all other criminals and psychopaths and scum are.
[00:39:59.085 --> 00:40:02.628]  They are totally obsessive-compulsive.
[00:40:03.649 --> 00:40:05.750]  Completely obsessive-compulsive.
[00:40:06.271 --> 00:40:10.614]  And they habitualize... In fact, it's deep in my stack, but I mentioned it.
[00:40:10.634 --> 00:40:11.475]  I'll cover that now.
[00:40:11.535 --> 00:40:12.516]  It's really important.
[00:40:15.218 --> 00:40:16.339]  Where is it here in my stack?
[00:40:16.859 --> 00:40:18.921]  I don't want to just mention that it was in Reuters.
[00:40:19.716 --> 00:40:23.918]  Because Neocon listeners deny everything I say, and they'll just say I made that up, too.
[00:40:23.978 --> 00:40:25.779]  Let me... Where is it?
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.521]  Oh, that's all the war news.
[00:40:30.201 --> 00:40:30.962]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[00:40:31.002 --> 00:40:31.602]  It's in Reuters.
[00:40:31.622 --> 00:40:34.623]  You can just type it into Google and find it.
[00:40:35.204 --> 00:40:36.124]  I'll come across it later.
[00:40:36.144 --> 00:40:39.766]  I don't have time to dig through literally 60-something stories to find it.
[00:40:41.019 --> 00:40:42.319]  Okay, let's run through the news here.
[00:40:42.459 --> 00:40:53.841]  I remember Sunday night into Monday morning, a tractor trailer full of gasoline blew up underneath an overpass, which was shoddily built, and it collapsed.
[00:40:54.321 --> 00:41:09.404]  And I talked about how every month, or more frequently, these overpasses collapse, or these extensions collapse, without even any fire or explosion or collision happening, just the trucks driving across it and it collapses.
[00:41:10.552 --> 00:41:11.972]  Well, here's CBS News.
[00:41:13.113 --> 00:41:19.775]  Of course, they tried to compare it to Building 7 and Tower 1 and 2 and claim, see, fire makes steel buildings collapse.
[00:41:20.975 --> 00:41:26.097]  As our guest said, or as a caller said, it's like comparing apples to dump trucks.
[00:41:27.857 --> 00:41:29.378]  Bigger difference than apples and oranges.
[00:41:29.678 --> 00:41:30.778]  Here's CBS News.
[00:41:30.838 --> 00:41:32.379]  I wonder if fire did this.
[00:41:32.619 --> 00:41:33.579]  No, fire didn't.
[00:41:34.244 --> 00:41:37.445]  CBS News, train carrying NASA boosters derails.
[00:41:37.905 --> 00:41:46.389]  A freight train carrying segments of the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters derailed Wednesday after a bridge collapsed, authorities said.
[00:41:46.789 --> 00:41:49.610]  Six people aboard the train were reported injured.
[00:41:51.591 --> 00:41:58.613]  One of the cars carrying one fully fueled rocket section overturned, reports CBS News corresponded.
[00:41:58.833 --> 00:42:01.574]  But there was no fire, no explosion, and NASA says no danger.
[00:42:02.455 --> 00:42:03.395]  So an entire
[00:42:04.654 --> 00:42:12.760]  Trestle Bridge, uh, collapsed, uh, and, uh, just from the weight, and where's the fire?
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:14.521]  Where's the, uh, jets hitting it?
[00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:29.891]  You know, oh, uh, again, these things are constantly, I just had a month, I, I, I, I, before I said that, I did a Google search for, for bridge collapse, road collapses, and it was like, you know, just hundreds of articles.
[00:42:30.071 --> 00:42:31.792]  I, it's probably every two days.
[00:42:31.872 --> 00:42:32.613]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:42:32.633 --> 00:42:34.234]  It doesn't get a lot of attention.
[00:42:35.444 --> 00:42:44.266]  I mean, every couple weeks I hear about a bridge or something collapsing in Texas, or an overpass, so it must be going on all over the place.
[00:42:45.567 --> 00:42:46.587]  But there it is.
[00:42:47.207 --> 00:42:53.629]  No fire, but it collapsed, because these bridges and these extensions are totally different than skyscrapers.
[00:42:54.209 --> 00:42:55.209]  It's like comparing
[00:42:56.837 --> 00:43:00.882]  A fruit fly to a human being.
[00:43:01.002 --> 00:43:08.053]  There's such scales of separation that it boggles the mind to even have to explain this.
[00:43:10.055 --> 00:43:10.376]  Okay.
[00:43:11.518 --> 00:43:12.960]  That is covered.
[00:43:14.401 --> 00:43:14.881]  Oh, here it is.
[00:43:14.921 --> 00:43:15.222]  I found it.
[00:43:15.242 --> 00:43:15.782]  It was right underneath.
[00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:17.183]  It was second in the stack.
[00:43:17.783 --> 00:43:20.325]  FDA urges young adult warning on antidepressants.
[00:43:20.505 --> 00:43:20.925]  Reuters.
[00:43:21.466 --> 00:43:28.491]  Warnings of antidepressant drugs should be expanded to save the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.
[00:43:28.511 --> 00:43:31.252]  Extend to adults ages 18 to 24.
[00:43:31.372 --> 00:43:31.412]  U.S.
[00:43:31.452 --> 00:43:32.693]  health officials said on Wednesday.
[00:43:33.094 --> 00:43:39.518]  If you actually go read what they said, it was that it also can cause violent outbursts and murderous behavior.
[00:43:41.613 --> 00:43:43.194]  It says the danger decreases.
[00:43:43.274 --> 00:43:47.435]  Oh, it decreases, however, for adults 65 and older when they take the medicines.
[00:43:47.455 --> 00:43:58.759]  Well, that's because they're not hopped up on their first big flood of testosterone and estrogen, and they're not, you know, energized with youth and already having all those psychological and physical changes.
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:05.282]  You throw a hallucinogen, that's what it's classified as, it puts you into a literal zombie dream state.
[00:44:05.842 --> 00:44:08.043]  Into young people, you're going to get fireworks.
[00:44:09.204 --> 00:44:14.150]  The cops will raid your house in 10 seconds if they think you've got hallucinogens that are illegal.
[00:44:14.511 --> 00:44:16.393]  But they take this legal stuff and push it.
[00:44:16.533 --> 00:44:17.514]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:44:18.676 --> 00:44:26.887]  The drugs already come with strong warnings that taking them may increase the chances of suicidal thoughts or actions in children and teenagers.
[00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:35.951]  Many psychiatrists have criticized the warning, saying they scare people away from the effective treatment and may be contributing to an increase in suicide in recent years.
[00:44:36.231 --> 00:44:37.171]  Oh, you got a lot of it.
[00:44:37.191 --> 00:44:47.753]  This stuff gets popular the last 15 years, suicide explodes, and then they say, oh, because people haven't been, um, have been criticizing it the last few, that's causing the skyrocketing.
[00:44:50.674 --> 00:44:56.435]  No, uh, you have a higher increase in suicide on people who take illegal hallucinogens.
[00:44:57.125 --> 00:45:04.967]  I mean, you might have ten good trips before you have that bad one, but when you have that bad one, so I've heard from those that have taken it, it's not pretty.
[00:45:05.747 --> 00:45:15.589]  You know, when you see a demon, you know, in your room, or the tree looks like a hobgoblin, or you think you can fly and jump out the window, or you think you've got bugs crawling on your skin.
[00:45:15.629 --> 00:45:18.430]  I mean, you know, we've all read about the things that have happened to people.
[00:45:19.614 --> 00:45:27.099]  But you put them on this stuff, everybody knows LSD causes people to, PCP, start chopping their own fingers off.
[00:45:28.581 --> 00:45:40.629]  Oh, but let's just take something even more sophisticated that puts it all right into the surface and let's put 15%, and that number's a couple years old, I know it's growing, let's increase it.
[00:45:40.649 --> 00:45:45.373]  Alright, talking about problem, reaction, solution.
[00:45:45.933 --> 00:45:48.455]  Oh, by the way, of course the psychiatrists don't want it to stop.
[00:45:49.051 --> 00:45:51.092]  They have the highest suicide rate in the country.
[00:45:51.572 --> 00:45:52.933]  That's a federal statistic.
[00:45:53.753 --> 00:45:55.273]  Let me tell you who has the highest suicide rates.
[00:45:55.774 --> 00:46:00.555]  Psychiatrists, gay men, then lesbian women.
[00:46:01.116 --> 00:46:01.956]  These are just facts.
[00:46:02.316 --> 00:46:03.577]  I'm not attacking these groups.
[00:46:04.057 --> 00:46:05.277]  I'm just giving you the facts.
[00:46:05.877 --> 00:46:10.699]  Because your body, your design, for some reason it's not healthy for you.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.340]  Psychiatrists.
[00:46:13.445 --> 00:46:22.611]  Gay men, lesbian women, then after that, psychologists, and then after that, for some reason, Asian men in this country.
[00:46:22.631 --> 00:46:29.296]  Now that was a few years ago, those numbers fluctuate back and forth, but it's generally, you know, those groups in the top, it's always psychiatrists.
[00:46:29.796 --> 00:46:32.498]  I mean, hell, they taught that in psychology when I was going to college.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.961]  Because they're a bunch of drug addicts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:37.722 --> 00:46:41.985]  Most of these psychiatrists, it's like a lot of your anesthesiologists.
[00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:50.138]  That's the highest rate in the country of opiate abuse because most of them got into it because they're on the stuff.
[00:46:50.899 --> 00:46:59.849]  I remember one time when I had a surgery for a broken leg when I was 16 and the guy was putting the IV in me and he was so stoned out of his gourd.
[00:47:00.149 --> 00:47:02.232]  I had surgery up in Rollette, Texas.
[00:47:03.231 --> 00:47:06.352]  This guy was so, so high, he could hardly keep his eyes open.
[00:47:06.372 --> 00:47:07.833]  He had big black circles around him.
[00:47:08.253 --> 00:47:09.533]  He looked totally stoned.
[00:47:09.933 --> 00:47:12.354]  He was getting off when he put the needle in.
[00:47:12.674 --> 00:47:14.475]  I saw him enjoying himself.
[00:47:14.895 --> 00:47:16.576]  I saw, I was pretty smart even then.
[00:47:16.596 --> 00:47:18.696]  I'm not saying I'm smart.
[00:47:18.716 --> 00:47:19.116]  You know what I mean?
[00:47:19.136 --> 00:47:20.297]  I've always picked up on stuff.
[00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:22.097]  And I actually had this feeling.
[00:47:22.157 --> 00:47:24.498]  I said, my God, this person doesn't know what they're doing.
[00:47:24.818 --> 00:47:26.879]  This person is completely drugged out of their head.
[00:47:27.099 --> 00:47:30.200]  And then they had problems and complications with the anesthesia.
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.000]  That's all I'm going to say.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:31.721]  It was not pretty.
[00:47:32.401 --> 00:47:32.661]  Okay?
[00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:35.672]  Uh, but let's just say I'm lucky to be alive.
[00:47:36.072 --> 00:47:46.101]  And then that same freak put my IV in and the nurse came in the middle of the night I had blood all over me because the IV came out of my hand because it was taped wrong.
[00:47:46.121 --> 00:47:49.404]  It wasn't cross-taped and then taped around.
[00:47:49.424 --> 00:47:53.568]  It was one piece of tape because the guy was so... Oh, I forgot that fun part.
[00:47:53.628 --> 00:47:54.709]  Waking up with blood on me.
[00:47:54.729 --> 00:47:57.812]  Uh, and I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:47:59.882 --> 00:48:00.582]  Oh, these people.
[00:48:00.722 --> 00:48:02.523]  I mean, it's just... Oh, I've already digressed.
[00:48:02.563 --> 00:48:03.023]  I'm sorry.
[00:48:03.443 --> 00:48:04.564]  See, everything's interconnected.
[00:48:06.184 --> 00:48:08.946]  Big report out of the Associated Press on the honeybee die-off.
[00:48:09.266 --> 00:48:10.926]  Now top scientists are freaking out.
[00:48:11.306 --> 00:48:18.229]  I'm glad you're freaking out over something real and not some UN hype about man-made global warming for a global carbon tax.
[00:48:18.909 --> 00:48:25.852]  By the way, I had read these documents and scanned over them, but I spent three hours last night
[00:48:26.909 --> 00:48:33.234]  Before I went and then watched another hour of the video of the guest we're about to have on, but I'll talk about that later.
[00:48:33.254 --> 00:48:35.116]  There's just too much info!
[00:48:35.136 --> 00:48:35.876]  I lose sleep!
[00:48:35.936 --> 00:48:36.297]  How do you?
[00:48:36.337 --> 00:48:38.158]  I mean, just the world is so much is happening.
[00:48:39.859 --> 00:48:43.002]  And I went and, what story was I telling?
[00:48:43.062 --> 00:48:46.825]  Oh yeah, I was on the Judicial Watch, which literally has thousands of pages of documents.
[00:48:47.415 --> 00:48:54.761]  I was on there for three hours, speed reading, and I found stuff far worse than even Jerome Corsi has found in the documents.
[00:48:55.221 --> 00:49:02.186]  And he found them talking about keeping it secret from the public, the North American Union at the September 23rd meeting, secret meeting in Canada.
[00:49:03.067 --> 00:49:07.630]  He found the part about, and I did find that by the way, underlined and everything.
[00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:10.192]  It says unclassified at the top.
[00:49:11.133 --> 00:49:12.334]  And it was official government.
[00:49:12.414 --> 00:49:13.695]  I mean, they had the heads of all the
[00:49:14.995 --> 00:49:21.720]  Canadian, US, and Mexican agencies there with corporate heads and George Shultz telling them what to do.
[00:49:22.741 --> 00:49:35.871]  I mean, this is government operating, and it was all how to use a carbon tax, how to use the fad of global warming as a way to get a carbon tax in North America, and how to sneak it in.
[00:49:36.492 --> 00:49:40.755]  And there was a bunch of other... Well, I got a big folder here in front of me.
[00:49:43.937 --> 00:49:44.538]  It was just
[00:49:45.842 --> 00:49:49.545]  It would make your head spin to go read this stuff.
[00:49:49.605 --> 00:49:50.605]  It's on Judicial Watch.
[00:49:51.246 --> 00:49:53.968]  Type Judicial Watch SPP into a search engine.
[00:49:54.308 --> 00:49:59.011]  Click, and that'll take you right to the subpages of Judicial Watch.
[00:49:59.512 --> 00:50:00.552]  And just spend three hours.
[00:50:00.933 --> 00:50:01.413]  Go ahead.
[00:50:02.273 --> 00:50:02.734]  Go read it.
[00:50:02.754 --> 00:50:03.855]  I mean, don't believe me.
[00:50:04.435 --> 00:50:06.076]  Go read this stuff for yourself.
[00:50:06.476 --> 00:50:07.717]  It's not my opinion.
[00:50:07.777 --> 00:50:08.398]  It's a fraud.
[00:50:08.698 --> 00:50:10.199]  They admit it's a fraud.
[00:50:10.925 --> 00:50:15.547]  Just like Dutch Rochelle created the peak oil fraud, because they're the oil companies.
[00:50:15.567 --> 00:50:20.469]  They want you to think it's artificially scarce, so you'll be a schmuck and pay $3 a gallon for it.
[00:50:21.869 --> 00:50:24.390]  I'm gonna talk about the war when we get back, and then we'll get our guest on.
[00:50:26.811 --> 00:50:29.772]  And, um... Oh, there is so much here.
[00:50:32.353 --> 00:50:33.754]  I'm gonna get to the war when we get back.
[00:50:34.894 --> 00:50:36.195]  The whole... What's happening in Iraq?
[00:50:36.215 --> 00:50:37.275]  What's happening with Iran?
[00:50:37.875 --> 00:50:39.356]  Are they getting nukes in position?
[00:50:40.453 --> 00:50:57.342]  I mean, we're talking really earth-shattering, world-shaking type events taking place right in front of our eyeballs and just amazing exhibitions of propaganda on display, on parade.
[00:51:03.186 --> 00:51:08.631]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:09.011 --> 00:51:16.658]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:17.344 --> 00:51:24.407]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:24.807 --> 00:51:36.252]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.532 --> 00:51:40.014]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:40.494 --> 00:51:42.435]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:42.755 --> 00:51:46.597]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:51:59.767 --> 00:52:08.033]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:08.293 --> 00:52:12.636]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:12.936 --> 00:52:21.842]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:22.062 --> 00:52:25.665]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:25.965 --> 00:52:30.989]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:31.289 --> 00:52:37.974]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:38.504 --> 00:52:39.145]  What about you?
[00:52:39.805 --> 00:52:45.150]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:52:59.733 --> 00:53:01.453]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:01.674 --> 00:53:05.374]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:05.695 --> 00:53:07.915]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:53:08.435 --> 00:53:14.637]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:14.777 --> 00:53:19.678]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:19.898 --> 00:53:28.905]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:53:58.784 --> 00:54:07.709]  Well, the union's a big business, man, and they're going out like a dinosaur.
[00:54:11.068 --> 00:54:11.508]  All right.
[00:54:41.135 --> 00:54:43.437]  We've got huge JFK news coming up.
[00:54:43.477 --> 00:54:44.498]  We've got guests on.
[00:54:44.518 --> 00:54:48.721]  I don't know how to do this, because I've got a bunch of news I want to cover, but I want to have our guests on as well.
[00:54:51.263 --> 00:54:54.546]  John, you got that full hour of a video I sent you, didn't you, last night?
[00:54:56.628 --> 00:55:04.755]  On that, it's these two young lay pastors walking from Denver to D.C., and they've just gotten over a couple states.
[00:55:04.975 --> 00:55:07.497]  And literally, every town they come to, they're just walking down the street.
[00:55:08.334 --> 00:55:10.055]  The police pull up, interrogate him.
[00:55:10.095 --> 00:55:11.356]  Some are nice, some are mean.
[00:55:12.337 --> 00:55:23.004]  One guy's brandishing his gun, threatening him, turn your camera off, you're violating my privacy, it's the law, but he wants to cram cameras down their throats and got cameras on them.
[00:55:23.024 --> 00:55:27.467]  I mean, it's really amazing video.
[00:55:28.568 --> 00:55:34.732]  When they run into old-timers out in the middle of nowhere at these weird junk shops and stuff that know all about the New World Order and
[00:55:35.527 --> 00:55:36.268]  It's pretty interesting.
[00:55:36.308 --> 00:55:37.709]  It makes me want to do a walkabout.
[00:55:37.729 --> 00:55:41.753]  I mean, I would love to put a backpack on my back and walk across this country.
[00:55:42.214 --> 00:55:47.559]  But I got married, and I had children, and I decided to fight the New World Order, so I'll never get to do that, probably, folks.
[00:55:47.579 --> 00:55:50.402]  It's called, uh, responsibilities.
[00:55:51.183 --> 00:55:52.704]  Believe me, that's what I like to do.
[00:55:53.825 --> 00:55:59.251]  I'd love to just, uh, literally have a little pup camp and just walk across the country.
[00:56:00.385 --> 00:56:01.105]  Sounds like heaven.
[00:56:01.405 --> 00:56:06.506]  I mean, I've walked a couple hundred miles before back when I was in college, but I've taken off a couple weeks and done that.
[00:56:07.787 --> 00:56:09.807]  But it's certainly not walking across the whole country.
[00:56:09.827 --> 00:56:11.047]  But I guess you can't do that anymore.
[00:56:11.087 --> 00:56:12.488]  My God, the level of harassment.
[00:56:13.128 --> 00:56:16.788]  Unless you're a pack of illegal aliens, then you're absolutely above the law.
[00:56:17.289 --> 00:56:19.209]  The cops just leave them alone because they've been told.
[00:56:19.429 --> 00:56:19.969]  Hands off.
[00:56:20.469 --> 00:56:22.430]  That's part of the death of America right there.
[00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:24.030]  That's the sword into the heart.
[00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:25.010]  You leave that alone.
[00:56:26.571 --> 00:56:27.471]  We've got an hour and a video.
[00:56:30.217 --> 00:56:35.360]  And, uh, from, uh, from, uh, it's up on Google Video, it's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:40.963]  But we'll try to play some of it before we even get these gentlemen on with us as they walk down the highway.
[00:56:42.764 --> 00:56:43.724]  But they're doing it smart.
[00:56:43.744 --> 00:56:44.925]  They're really illustrating things.
[00:56:44.945 --> 00:56:48.267]  They have friends following them that meet up with them every few days in an RV.
[00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:54.293]  It's about ministering to people and saying that Jesus wouldn't be for the war and the rest of it.
[00:56:54.753 --> 00:57:09.385]  I was listening to that neocon, fake conservative, very deceptive, un-American piece of filth, Neil Bortz, today, driving into the office, and I heard just the same lie, the same memo, the same thing they literally repeat like a Hare Krishna mantra.
[00:57:10.271 --> 00:57:14.615]  They just parrot it over and over and over and over again.
[00:57:14.635 --> 00:57:30.628]  And that is, Al-Qaeda is over there, and Iran is behind Al-Qaeda, and they are going to take over Iraq and use it as a base to cut off all the oil and to create terrorist training camps to kill all the American people.
[00:57:31.952 --> 00:57:34.815]  Well, A, Iran is not with Al-Qaeda.
[00:57:35.075 --> 00:57:41.181]  If you believe Al-Qaeda really springs out of the Middle East, it's Sunni, and it comes out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:57:41.561 --> 00:57:45.665]  The Iranians are Shia, the exact opposite, and mortal enemies.
[00:57:45.705 --> 00:57:48.067]  They hate each other more than they dislike the West.
[00:57:48.147 --> 00:57:48.468]  Okay?
[00:57:48.728 --> 00:57:51.110]  That's just an absolute fact, but you've got a general public.
[00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:52.692]  You've got members of Congress on committees.
[00:57:53.252 --> 00:58:02.699]  That don't know the difference between a Shia and a Sunni, so... This propaganda works, because you're... And he sits up there with these lawyer tricks, arguing with people, bringing up false points.
[00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:04.620]  He knows what he's doing, that's why I hate him.
[00:58:05.061 --> 00:58:08.543]  I mean, just imagine being actively evil, wanting to destroy the country.
[00:58:08.643 --> 00:58:09.484]  I mean, it's incredible!
[00:58:13.027 --> 00:58:15.268]  And so, we get back.
[00:58:15.288 --> 00:58:17.089]  We'll get our guest on in five minutes.
[00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:18.430]  When we get back, I'm going to talk about the war.
[00:58:19.311 --> 00:58:20.432]  Because I want to go through some of this.
[00:58:20.982 --> 00:58:25.204]  I want to just go through basic 101 lies that are absolute facts.
[00:58:26.104 --> 00:58:29.006]  I mean, this can be verified in 30 seconds.
[00:58:29.506 --> 00:58:31.066]  Please, don't believe me, check it out.
[00:58:31.387 --> 00:58:32.607]  Find out they're lying to you.
[00:58:33.007 --> 00:58:38.870]  Okay, so we're going to explain what's really going on when we get back.

[00:58:57.599 --> 00:58:58.660]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:00.461]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.122 --> 00:59:01.942]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.703 --> 00:59:03.583]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.603 --> 00:59:08.227]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.447 --> 00:59:12.570]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.232 --> 00:59:21.296]  For well over four years, we've been told we've got to fight them over there so we don't have to fight them over here.
[00:59:23.067 --> 00:59:25.828]  And that Iraq's the front line in the fight against Al-Qaeda.
[00:59:26.508 --> 00:59:33.591]  Then you find out that even when the NCs admitted that our government founded Al-Qaeda in 79, funded them up into the late 1990s.
[00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:44.716]  Al-Qaeda is just the name they give to any Muslim or any Middle Easterner or any Asian, even some of them Christians who fight back, is called Al-Qaeda.
[00:59:44.736 --> 00:59:50.798]  And the roots of the radical Wahhabist sect of the Sunni
[00:59:51.778 --> 00:59:55.342]  Uh, is right out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:59:56.823 --> 01:00:05.691]  But I hear Neil Borch, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, all the fake conservatives, all the Judas Crows, all the... They're just camouflaged enemy attack vessels.
[01:00:05.731 --> 01:00:06.372]  I mean, that's what they are.
[01:00:06.392 --> 01:00:11.717]  They're there to camouflage, so you don't know they're a stealth enemy until they're up on top of you.
[01:00:12.344 --> 01:00:19.349]  You know, keep your friends close, your enemies close, your conservatives are the enemy of the New World Order, so they put out a bunch of phonies and they've got you sucked in and it works like a charm.
[01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:21.091]  So the country's on its knees right now.
[01:00:21.571 --> 01:00:23.773]  You could wake up, maybe save the country, but you probably won't.
[01:00:24.633 --> 01:00:32.279]  So, Neil Borch, the lawyer, gets up there and it's so deceptive and it's so rudimentary that I remember that his audience is low-grade morons, by and large.
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:33.440]  I mean, literally.
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:35.582]  That's what the general public's been turned into by design.
[01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:43.984]  And he says that Iran's behind Al-Qaeda and that Iran wants to take over and set up Al-Qaeda bases in Iraq.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.461]  Iran hates Al Qaeda.
[01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:48.323]  Iran always fought to keep it out.
[01:00:48.423 --> 01:00:53.707]  Our government actually used Al Qaeda to try to overthrow Iran several separate times.
[01:00:54.128 --> 01:00:56.830]  That's in the mainstream history books, and the CIA has admitted that.
[01:00:57.490 --> 01:01:01.614]  Saddam was anti-Al Qaeda, constantly arresting him, constantly killing him.
[01:01:01.634 --> 01:01:04.136]  That's most of the, quote, killings and torturing he did.
[01:01:04.156 --> 01:01:04.937]  And I'm not defending it.
[01:01:05.257 --> 01:01:11.282]  As a CIA-installed dictator, he was pretty brutal, but not compared to the rest of the region, but compared to our standards.
[01:01:12.717 --> 01:01:16.218]  But he was an earlier US policy that was frankly a lot better.
[01:01:17.399 --> 01:01:20.180]  But still had evil behind it to export attacks on Iran.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.201]  So they claim that Al-Qaeda is involved with Iran.
[01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:26.562]  The Iranians want to mine the Persian Gulf.
[01:01:26.602 --> 01:01:29.183]  They want to take over Iraq and set up Al-Qaeda training bases.
[01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:32.044]  Number one, Iran is not Al-Qaeda.
[01:01:32.084 --> 01:01:34.484]  Even if you believe Al-Qaeda exists, it's the wrong group.
[01:01:34.544 --> 01:01:40.226]  It's like saying the Dallas Cowboys are the Tennessee Titans.
[01:01:40.306 --> 01:01:41.967]  Or the Dallas Cowboys are the Redskins.
[01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:44.185]  No, it's the complete opposite.
[01:01:44.245 --> 01:01:45.166]  Do you understand?
[01:01:45.586 --> 01:01:47.306]  But again, they know that you don't know that.
[01:01:47.526 --> 01:01:49.347]  And I don't mean my audience, but the general public.
[01:01:50.167 --> 01:01:53.407]  And then Bort says, we went over there to fight Al-Qaeda so they wouldn't come over here.
[01:01:53.928 --> 01:01:54.428]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:01:54.448 --> 01:01:57.788]  I thought we went over there to get Saddam out because he had rape rooms and torture rooms.
[01:01:58.109 --> 01:01:59.969]  Of course, we find out that's really what our government set up.
[01:02:01.389 --> 01:02:05.590]  And I guess, you know, we went over there to get democracy and pull out in six months, they promised the troops.
[01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:07.471]  It was all lies.
[01:02:08.211 --> 01:02:08.551]  But see,
[01:02:09.953 --> 01:02:22.062]  It's just like the psychiatrist saying, well, we don't care if suicide skyrocketed, because there's more suicide, because kids are on these drugs that cause it, we need to drug more kids now and have more psychological testing.
[01:02:22.943 --> 01:02:23.583]  It's the same thing.
[01:02:23.623 --> 01:02:29.107]  Well, we're in Iraq now, and so Al-Qaeda's there, so we've got to stay so they don't take over.
[01:02:29.647 --> 01:02:34.451]  There wouldn't be an insurgency, there wouldn't be this resistance, if Saddam Hussein had been left in power.
[01:02:36.181 --> 01:02:50.190]  See that was part of a different policy 30 years ago when they helped position Saddam Hussein as the head of the Baathist security force to get in there was to have a stabilizing effect and to have him as a puppet to then fight Iran.
[01:02:50.830 --> 01:03:01.217]  They removed that and the CIA, the MI6 analysts, all the major think tanks said it will break into three parts, it'll be total battle and death, and the new order said excellent.
[01:03:02.618 --> 01:03:05.360]  Here's the analogy, it's like Bush and company are bank robbers.
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:11.222]  And if they can stall the police coming, they've got more time to offload the gold out of the vault.
[01:03:12.263 --> 01:03:15.764]  And so every week, every day, every month, every year they stay there.
[01:03:16.064 --> 01:03:18.546]  It's hundreds of billions in no-bid weapons contracts.
[01:03:19.226 --> 01:03:24.708]  It's hundreds of billions in oil sales, because it jacks oil prices up, because the oil isn't flowing.
[01:03:25.008 --> 01:03:29.130]  What they got mad at Saddam for in 1990, pumping too much.
[01:03:29.951 --> 01:03:31.171]  Go pull the newspapers, we did.
[01:03:32.332 --> 01:03:32.592]  You see?
[01:03:33.519 --> 01:03:35.880]  So they're literally just, they're stalling you every day.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.620]  That's what Limbaugh and them do, is stall.
[01:03:37.921 --> 01:03:40.381]  Hey, well you know, and don't let the boys down.
[01:03:40.441 --> 01:03:41.342]  They want to win.
[01:03:41.662 --> 01:03:42.782]  They really want to stay.
[01:03:43.282 --> 01:03:47.524]  Yeah, about 25% of them are dumber than dirt and dew, but 75% are smart.
[01:03:47.544 --> 01:03:50.165]  A lot smarter than the general public, and they want out.
[01:03:50.225 --> 01:03:51.125]  They know it's a fraud.
[01:03:54.933 --> 01:04:00.420]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:00.781 --> 01:04:08.370]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:16.184]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:16.565 --> 01:04:27.993]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.314 --> 01:04:32.237]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:32.257 --> 01:04:34.238]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:37.621]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone fully informed must see.

[01:05:52.802 --> 01:05:56.923]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:05:57.163 --> 01:05:58.924]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:05:59.184 --> 01:06:05.466]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:06:05.766 --> 01:06:11.887]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:06:12.127 --> 01:06:13.968]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:06:14.248 --> 01:06:14.529]  I think?

[01:06:40.434 --> 01:06:40.815]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:06:40.835 --> 01:06:40.895]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:06:40.915 --> 01:06:41.815]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:41.835 --> 01:06:42.896]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:02.574]  We pause now to look at the state of the First Amendment in this country.
[01:07:03.214 --> 01:07:07.458]  Raymond Schaub and Elliot Nish will tell you a little bit about themselves.
[01:07:08.599 --> 01:07:11.562]  My producer, who's my wife, has talked to him, but I never talked to him.
[01:07:11.582 --> 01:07:20.429]  I sat up late last night watching the entire video that he's put up on Google that we linked to on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:25.394]  I think... I can't wait to see, after all their travels,
[01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:28.125]  They ought to put it together in a documentary film.
[01:07:28.145 --> 01:07:29.405]  That's obviously their idea.
[01:07:29.425 --> 01:07:32.926]  Maybe we'll carry it, because it looks really informative, what they've done there.
[01:07:34.687 --> 01:07:37.128]  But it dovetails with the New York Police.
[01:07:37.148 --> 01:07:51.353]  A few weeks ago, we aired this last week here on air, coming up to our reporter, Luke Radowski, and saying, oh, look, he's got a bomb.
[01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:57.049]  I know you're not a terrorist, but I'm going to say you are to put you in jail for 30 days under the Terrorist Act.
[01:07:58.410 --> 01:07:59.690]  Guess who's going to jail?
[01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:00.570]  Guess who's going to jail?
[01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:02.050]  Ha ha ha!
[01:08:02.090 --> 01:08:03.291]  We've played that several times here.
[01:08:03.331 --> 01:08:04.591]  It's up on the website if you want.
[01:08:05.851 --> 01:08:08.012]  Up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:08.232 --> 01:08:14.053]  The easiest place to find it is JonesReport.com because that's where the big article that Aaron Dykes put together is with the video.
[01:08:15.934 --> 01:08:18.174]  And I mean, it's frightening to me.
[01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:20.755]  And not like frightening and then I get scared, but just
[01:08:21.758 --> 01:08:24.580]  Frightening in that... I don't know if that's the right word.
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:25.521]  It's alarming.
[01:08:26.441 --> 01:08:30.524]  It just lets me know how really real this is to see more and more of this.
[01:08:34.306 --> 01:08:41.011]  And, uh... Let's go ahead and play about six minutes of this hour-long video.
[01:08:41.031 --> 01:08:42.712]  This is kind of a compilation at the first.
[01:08:43.972 --> 01:08:46.134]  And it starts with an image of a burning building.
[01:08:46.795 --> 01:08:49.957]  I guess shades of Iraq and he says this is what America is going to look like.
[01:08:50.257 --> 01:08:51.398]  Then they go into the police.
[01:08:51.758 --> 01:08:53.459]  This is just in the first few weeks of their trip.
[01:08:53.499 --> 01:08:54.320]  They just started this.
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:55.781]  They've only gone through a couple states.
[01:08:56.501 --> 01:08:59.663]  From Colorado into Kansas and maybe out of Kansas now.
[01:08:59.783 --> 01:09:04.466]  And I mean it's just sometimes they get stopped multiple times out in the country per county.
[01:09:05.247 --> 01:09:07.508]  And guys run out and freak out and run up on them.
[01:09:07.528 --> 01:09:11.651]  They just got signs saying Jesus is against war.
[01:09:11.671 --> 01:09:12.812]  Real Christians don't seek war.
[01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:21.854]  So let's go ahead and play that, and then coming up, big developments on JFK, huge ones.
[01:09:22.314 --> 01:09:27.019]  This from Salon Magazine, on the heels of our interview with St.
[01:09:27.079 --> 01:09:28.581]  John Hunt yesterday.
[01:09:28.601 --> 01:09:31.944]  I said I'd finish up with the Iraq War news.
[01:09:33.526 --> 01:09:38.051]  I haven't even done that yet, but we'll do that as well.
[01:09:39.105 --> 01:09:42.868]  In fact, I just canceled the guest in the third hour because I don't have time to go over the news and take calls.
[01:09:43.288 --> 01:09:48.911]  But let's go ahead and play the first six minutes of this hour-long video they put together while on the road.
[01:09:49.472 --> 01:09:51.373]  And I guess uploaded from a library or something.
[01:09:52.294 --> 01:09:54.555]  Editing and shooting video living on the street.
[01:09:54.595 --> 01:09:54.995]  Here it is.
[01:09:56.656 --> 01:10:00.739]  This is what's going to happen to America unless you seek God's face.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:06.763]  All your works that are not done in the name of Jesus Christ are going to burn up.
[01:10:08.007 --> 01:10:10.748]  Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.
[01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:24.453]  Actually, I think this is an interesting spot, right?
[01:10:25.313 --> 01:10:26.615]  Do we have to show you our ID?
[01:10:26.775 --> 01:10:27.376]  Yes, you do.
[01:10:27.776 --> 01:10:30.159]  I'm not going to write you guys a ticket or anything like that.
[01:10:30.199 --> 01:10:31.721]  I just need to see some ID, please.
[01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:32.983]  Who's got your ID on you?
[01:10:33.023 --> 01:10:34.104]  Let me see your ID.
[01:10:34.124 --> 01:10:35.806]  Do you have any ID on you?
[01:10:35.826 --> 01:10:36.027]  Yes.
[01:10:36.087 --> 01:10:36.908]  What's your date of birth?
[01:10:37.268 --> 01:10:38.249]  March 8th, 1985.
[01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:42.995]  We can't walk around in America anymore without getting stopped by an officer.
[01:10:51.988 --> 01:10:52.168]  What?
[01:10:52.589 --> 01:10:53.390]  I'm taking the camera off.
[01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:54.171]  You're public.
[01:10:54.191 --> 01:10:54.251]  Huh?
[01:10:54.492 --> 01:10:56.936]  You're going to turn that off right now.
[01:10:56.996 --> 01:10:57.296]  Why?
[01:10:57.316 --> 01:10:58.278]  Turn that off right now.
[01:10:59.099 --> 01:10:59.841]  Turn that off, me.
[01:11:00.121 --> 01:11:00.682]  You're public.
[01:11:00.722 --> 01:11:00.942]  Why?
[01:11:01.443 --> 01:11:02.465]  No, I'm not.
[01:11:02.485 --> 01:11:03.006]  Turn it off.
[01:11:03.466 --> 01:11:04.308]  You'll pay taxes.
[01:11:04.328 --> 01:11:05.009]  I don't care.
[01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:06.211]  What did I tell you?
[01:11:21.878 --> 01:11:36.081]  We'll be closer in the name of democracy!
[01:11:36.941 --> 01:11:37.382]  Shalom.
[01:11:38.522 --> 01:11:39.902]  This is Boyz from the Wilderness.
[01:11:40.222 --> 01:11:41.262]  The Denver to D.C.
[01:11:41.342 --> 01:11:43.643]  Walk for Truth video update.
[01:11:44.856 --> 01:11:46.977]  And I'm Brother Elliot and I'm Brother Ray.
[01:11:47.198 --> 01:11:51.900]  We are chronicling our trip from Denver to D.C.
[01:11:53.241 --> 01:11:59.285]  and recently the Lord has been putting new issues on our heart to speak about.
[01:11:59.965 --> 01:12:10.931]  Obviously our walk is three-fold to warn the world to prepare a path for the Lord Jesus Christ and His second coming and to
[01:12:12.864 --> 01:12:21.746]  Call the Evangelical Churches to repentance and to demand an investigation into the 9-11 attacks.
[01:12:23.007 --> 01:12:41.732]  And with this past week, it's been put on our heart to chronicle the erosion of our civil liberties and the police state, which is beginning to emerge, which is just the beginning of the New World Order, One World Government,
[01:12:42.389 --> 01:12:50.652]  Which will usher in the Antichrist that we read about in Revelation and the Mark of the Beast.
[01:12:51.353 --> 01:12:59.856]  We're also going to chronicle the power of prayer in these video updates and show that God is living and powerful.
[01:12:59.916 --> 01:13:02.437]  But first, it's the news.
[01:13:04.318 --> 01:13:06.399]  Each week we're going to pick some relevant items.
[01:13:06.439 --> 01:13:09.240]  I have a million things I'd like to talk about this week.
[01:13:09.824 --> 01:13:13.107]  But, for the sake of time, I want to keep it short.
[01:13:13.567 --> 01:13:19.272]  Some articles we found is, number one, Evangelicals state that the U.S.
[01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:20.994]  has crossed a moral line.
[01:13:21.014 --> 01:13:36.306]  The National Association of Evangelicals, under their new president, after their former president has resigned, has come out publicly and stated that torture is crossing boundaries of what is legally and morally permissible.
[01:13:36.567 --> 01:13:38.028]  And I praise the Lord, it's a step
[01:13:38.817 --> 01:13:40.498]  But we're calling the church to repentance.
[01:13:41.338 --> 01:13:44.279]  This whole war is immoral and unpermissible.
[01:13:44.299 --> 01:13:46.160]  This whole war is unconstitutional.
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.721]  What we've done to Iraq is genocide.
[01:13:49.541 --> 01:13:54.203]  What we're continuing to do to those people is full of deception and wickedness.
[01:13:55.184 --> 01:13:56.584]  CIA secret prisons?
[01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:58.485]  They're not talking about those things.
[01:13:59.065 --> 01:14:00.046]  Depleted uranium?
[01:14:00.286 --> 01:14:01.747]  They're not talking about those things.
[01:14:01.767 --> 01:14:04.468]  9-11 being an inside job?
[01:14:04.988 --> 01:14:06.529]  They're not talking about those things.
[01:14:08.519 --> 01:14:13.823]  It's a step forward, but National Association of Evangelicals, please listen to me.
[01:14:14.243 --> 01:14:18.426]  You need to repent and admit, you guys put an evil man in the office.
[01:14:18.826 --> 01:14:24.230]  And if he is a born again Christian, he's fallen so far to the wayside, he's just a bare branch.
[01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:35.858]  Because even this week, when he was caught, having Alberto Gonzalez abuse the Patriot Act again, and fire a bunch of U.S.
[01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:37.659]  attorneys to put in their own cronies,
[01:14:38.103 --> 01:14:39.863]  They want Karl Rove and Harriet Meier.
[01:14:40.303 --> 01:14:41.204]  So that gives you an idea.
[01:14:41.244 --> 01:14:43.844]  They come in with kind of a synopsis of what's happened to them.
[01:14:43.884 --> 01:14:46.484]  There's like four or five minutes of them showing some news articles.
[01:14:47.025 --> 01:14:52.725]  And then they go back out on the street and then they talk to people out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:14:52.946 --> 01:14:54.486]  I mean, on country roads.
[01:14:54.806 --> 01:14:56.826]  And you see an anti-New World Order sign.
[01:14:56.846 --> 01:14:59.527]  And then they find some old guy and they say, what's that?
[01:14:59.547 --> 01:15:00.867]  And he goes, oh, that was a family.
[01:15:01.167 --> 01:15:01.867]  Put those up.
[01:15:01.907 --> 01:15:07.328]  But they burned down his place and burned down the signs and tried to kill him and ran him off.
[01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:16.057]  Yeah, we've been trying to warn folks about the New World Order for a while, and you just find out how sick it is in these small towns, just like it is in the big city.
[01:15:16.858 --> 01:15:18.559]  And then people are scared everywhere.
[01:15:18.599 --> 01:15:21.062]  The police come up and say, the people are scared.
[01:15:21.082 --> 01:15:24.325]  You've got to stop preaching here on the street corner.
[01:15:24.385 --> 01:15:25.646]  It's scaring everyone.
[01:15:25.686 --> 01:15:26.807]  You need to move along.
[01:15:28.569 --> 01:15:29.449]  Well, is this illegal?
[01:15:29.609 --> 01:15:31.271]  No, but you just need to move along.
[01:15:31.331 --> 01:15:32.452]  It's scaring the people.
[01:15:33.033 --> 01:15:34.354]  And that's what America's turned into.
[01:15:35.012 --> 01:15:42.517]  A hundred years ago, fifty years ago, that was the entertainment was the stump down at the city center, at the town center, at the town square.
[01:15:42.858 --> 01:15:51.524]  People went and argued and debated and that was, no, now we watch television, we get scared by all the sick, evil stuff that's on there and then we just, it's unbelievable.
[01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:55.531]  They've got a ministry, and really I don't know you guys.
[01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:56.611]  I mean, I feel like I do.
[01:15:56.651 --> 01:15:58.892]  I watched an hour-long video and read about some of your ministry.
[01:15:59.592 --> 01:16:03.053]  But going back to Raymond Schwab and Elliot Nash.
[01:16:03.853 --> 01:16:13.995]  Raymond, Elliot, first, Raymond, announce yourself and kind of just boil it down, who you are, why you did this, and what you're doing, and then let's get a little bit into some more of the clips.
[01:16:16.116 --> 01:16:16.376]  Sure.
[01:16:16.436 --> 01:16:18.456]  Thanks, Alex, for having us on.
[01:16:18.677 --> 01:16:19.757]  My name is Raymond Schwab.
[01:16:21.127 --> 01:16:27.490]  We left Colorado March 1st and I was an evangelical Christian college student.
[01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:38.814]  Saw all of this deception in my school and my church concerning the war in Iraq, the support of the president, the illegal things we were doing that people wouldn't talk about 9-11.
[01:16:38.874 --> 01:16:45.417]  We would hand out your videos and other people's videos and decided that we needed to get more visible.
[01:16:45.457 --> 01:16:49.158]  We had many leaders tell us that we didn't have a platform to speak these things.
[01:16:49.922 --> 01:17:11.669]  We didn't even realize, you know, I've seen your police state videos, but had never really experienced it to the level that we have since we've taken off, but it actually culminated in me and Elliot did an anti-war protest in 9-11, a visibility movement, outside of my school on a public sidewalk, and they suspended me, and so
[01:17:12.765 --> 01:17:18.393]  We realize, you know, like you said, even in the small towns, the whole head is sick, the whole body is sick right now.
[01:17:18.714 --> 01:17:21.277]  How old are you Raymond Schwab?
[01:17:22.139 --> 01:17:22.279]  I'm 31.
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:26.225]  Okay, and what school suspended you?
[01:17:27.188 --> 01:17:28.629]  Colorado Christian University.
[01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:29.991]  I'm actually still on sanction.
[01:17:30.011 --> 01:17:34.555]  They said if I behave myself I can come back, but I'm obviously not behaving myself.
[01:17:34.595 --> 01:17:41.921]  Wow, so the school, in America, a Christian school, don't protest on the sidewalk, don't have an opinion, or you'll get kicked out.
[01:17:42.622 --> 01:17:44.764]  Now we're about to break, but I want to introduce Elliot Nash.
[01:17:45.264 --> 01:17:46.365]  Elliot, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:17:47.286 --> 01:17:48.007]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:17:48.607 --> 01:17:49.608]  This is Elliot.
[01:17:49.668 --> 01:17:53.352]  I'm 22 years old, and like Raymond, I
[01:17:53.905 --> 01:17:54.345]  We're good to go.
[01:18:25.517 --> 01:18:26.838]  Amen, I've seen that as well.
[01:18:27.178 --> 01:18:40.507]  It's contrary to the gospel of Jesus Christ and peace and it's, you know, support any action of this government as long as it supports the evangelical Christian president that's a deceiver and it's very disheartening.
[01:18:40.707 --> 01:18:47.252]  Well, if you can't look at George Bush and see that that guy has got a legion of demons in him, you're completely blind.
[01:18:47.272 --> 01:18:47.832]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:52.611]  How are you doing today?

[01:19:48.521 --> 01:19:54.685]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:55.046 --> 01:19:57.047]  Here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:19:58.248 --> 01:20:03.092]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:03.292 --> 01:20:06.014]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:06.054 --> 01:20:07.175]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:08.507 --> 01:20:13.091]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:14.031 --> 01:20:21.297]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:20:22.298 --> 01:20:25.360]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.

[01:20:43.335 --> 01:20:43.635]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:51.641]  Attention gardeners!
[01:21:51.701 --> 01:21:54.062]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:21:54.302 --> 01:21:58.644]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:21:58.845 --> 01:22:06.709]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:22:07.029 --> 01:22:09.871]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:22:10.151 --> 01:22:17.695]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:22:17.775 --> 01:22:23.378]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:22:23.618 --> 01:22:29.161]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:22:29.441 --> 01:22:32.763]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:22:33.003 --> 01:22:36.345]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:22:36.585 --> 01:22:41.628]  GCN listeners who want to grow Derv's Chief Superfood should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:22:41.648 --> 01:22:44.509]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:22:44.569 --> 01:22:44.810]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:22:44.850 --> 01:22:46.470]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[01:23:05.502 --> 01:23:09.765]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:09.845 --> 01:23:17.691]  Look, I make this point, but because I don't hear it being made anywhere else.
[01:23:34.907 --> 01:23:36.207]  We need to get this out to the public.
[01:23:36.748 --> 01:23:54.212]  The people launching the war are doing it to make incredible profits, consolidate power, build permanent bases to dominate that region and bring it into the new world order, while we pay for it and while the very same people destroy our borders and our sovereignty and our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:23:54.612 --> 01:24:00.294]  The people killing the Iraqi people's freedom and sovereignty are the same ones killing our freedom and sovereignty.
[01:24:00.894 --> 01:24:01.714]  It's very simple.
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:04.260]  We've got a bunch of clips here.
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:16.725]  I'm trying to find the one in the hour long video where they are just out in the middle of nowhere and there's a Impeach Bill Clinton battle the New World Order, an old fated sign, and a local shows up who knows all about the New World Order.
[01:24:16.745 --> 01:24:17.506]  We're going to find that.
[01:24:18.106 --> 01:24:18.886]  We're going to play that.
[01:24:19.867 --> 01:24:21.988]  And that is coming up.
[01:24:22.408 --> 01:24:30.451]  But going back to our guests who are with us, Raymond Schwab and Elliot Nash, where are you gentlemen right now?
[01:24:33.157 --> 01:24:46.160]  We're currently in Lawrence, Kansas on our way to Kansas City to do a 9-11 visibility action on May 11th.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.560]  How many days have you been walking?
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:54.401]  We started March 1st at Denver, Colorado.
[01:24:55.021 --> 01:24:57.402]  How many times have the police stopped you?
[01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:01.851]  Oh, we don't even have it all on video, Alex.
[01:25:01.911 --> 01:25:07.113]  We could stop literally... Actually, I think now they're starting to call ahead because we filed two complaints.
[01:25:07.633 --> 01:25:19.378]  The last complaint we had on video, even better, and the sheriff just kept turning redder and redder as he watched it, as he watched his officer harass Elliot, eating a sandwich in a park and demanding that Elliot leave town.
[01:25:19.978 --> 01:25:24.480]  And I think there's... Because now, as we walk, police just kind of wave and drive by.
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:29.062]  And I noticed we were getting hits from Kansas Highway Patrol and other Kansas agencies.
[01:25:29.813 --> 01:25:37.679]  Um, prior to Dickinson County, Kansas, we were getting stopped every day, every county, every town, and we'd just time it.
[01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:52.871]  Once we started holding our signs on a street corner, we would have a camera in our hand at all times, behind the sign, and, uh, we'd be like, any minute now they're gonna show up, and sure enough, within two to three minutes, sometimes five minutes... Which shows that the American people see two young men
[01:25:53.843 --> 01:26:00.366]  Sitting there, you know, dressed in a clean-cut fashion with signs saying, Christians are against war.
[01:26:01.187 --> 01:26:02.487]  Tell the folks what your signs say.
[01:26:03.928 --> 01:26:06.729]  We have signs that say, Real Christians don't choose war.
[01:26:07.049 --> 01:26:08.630]  Jesus, the only way.
[01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:12.612]  We have a few 9-11 signs that say, Demand a 9-11 truth.
[01:26:12.652 --> 01:26:14.953]  Stop the 9-11 cover-up.
[01:26:15.353 --> 01:26:16.234]  But I've seen the video.
[01:26:16.314 --> 01:26:19.055]  It's usually the Jesus signs that really get these people upset.
[01:26:19.935 --> 01:26:20.096]  Right.
[01:26:20.136 --> 01:26:23.057]  We were walking through one town and the sheriff came.
[01:26:23.712 --> 01:26:26.394]  And he said, you can't walk through town with those signs like that.
[01:26:26.454 --> 01:26:27.594]  I need to see some ID.
[01:26:27.914 --> 01:26:33.498]  And immediately we pulled out the camera and started videotaping, and then he completely changed his composure.
[01:26:35.119 --> 01:26:37.520]  Yeah, they really need to move to Russia.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:38.280]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:44.124]  I was just going to say, and it's funny, it's like, you know, Jesus talked about a lamp on a lamp stand.
[01:26:44.184 --> 01:26:46.585]  As soon as that light comes out, they just kind of cower.
[01:26:46.625 --> 01:26:50.948]  And, you know, I challenged him about the things they say off camera, and they deny it.
[01:26:51.008 --> 01:26:52.889]  That one officer that told that to him, I said, you know,
[01:26:53.571 --> 01:26:56.275]  What did you tell us about not walking through town with these signs?
[01:26:56.455 --> 01:26:57.396]  Here's what you gotta do.
[01:26:57.437 --> 01:26:58.999]  I know you guys don't have a lot of money.
[01:26:59.019 --> 01:27:00.020]  You barely have money to eat.
[01:27:00.681 --> 01:27:02.123]  But really...
[01:27:03.477 --> 01:27:26.715]  You know what, I need to just send you, they have these little bitty cameras that are button sized now, they didn't have these a few years ago, and they're not that expensive, that go into a, you know, like 5 gig recording stick, that's very easy to hide, because the stuff you've got on tape is bad enough, and I know we've just seen part one, not the new stuff with Don't Eat That Sandwich, we know you're with Al-Qaeda, but you need to get the stuff when they don't know that they're on camera.
[01:27:27.856 --> 01:27:30.418]  Oh, that would be awesome, Alex, and I tell you what,
[01:27:32.173 --> 01:27:33.834]  It's just, it's just been incredible.
[01:27:33.894 --> 01:27:37.116]  And at first, as you watch the videos, you guys know you need to be careful.
[01:27:37.176 --> 01:27:41.899]  It might, it could end up being like, uh, you know, born to be wild or whatever.
[01:27:41.939 --> 01:27:45.721]  What's the, what's the classic movie where they're out riding the motorcycles and the guys blast them?
[01:27:47.242 --> 01:27:47.903]  Easy Rider.
[01:27:47.923 --> 01:27:48.583]  Easy Rider.
[01:27:48.623 --> 01:27:49.564]  That stuff's real.
[01:27:49.584 --> 01:27:56.868]  We joke about that sometimes when we walk into these cities, but, uh, we've actually decided here in Kansas this next time,
[01:27:57.618 --> 01:27:59.199]  We're going to let them arrest one of us.
[01:27:59.399 --> 01:28:02.579]  We called the Attorney General and found out that what they were doing was illegal.
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:06.440]  This time we're going to make them actually act upon it to where they're liable.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:19.104]  Now imagine, you're walking along on the side of a farm road by cornfields, and a guy jumps out with a gun stuck in his belt, runs up out of uniform going, Turn the camera off right now!
[01:28:19.224 --> 01:28:21.464]  It's the law!
[01:28:21.884 --> 01:28:22.905]  And you say, what law?
[01:28:22.925 --> 01:28:23.665]  And they don't even know.
[01:28:24.514 --> 01:28:27.355]  And they don't know they're like a spike right through America's heart, man.
[01:28:28.375 --> 01:28:29.956]  These guys are just something else.
[01:28:30.256 --> 01:28:30.716]  Stay there.
[01:28:31.116 --> 01:28:32.237]  Final segment with our guests.
[01:28:32.257 --> 01:28:33.357]  We're going to play a few more clips.
[01:28:33.857 --> 01:28:34.998]  Tell you how you can support them.
[01:28:35.798 --> 01:28:37.799]  I just mailed Luke Radowski two video cameras.
[01:28:37.819 --> 01:28:39.779]  I don't have the money to mail these guys a small camera.
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:41.560]  We're on the march.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:43.641]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:44.581 --> 01:28:47.242]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:50.512 --> 01:28:54.553]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:28:54.773 --> 01:28:58.174]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:28:58.354 --> 01:29:01.835]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:29:02.095 --> 01:29:05.296]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:29:05.316 --> 01:29:10.837]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we've seen.
[01:29:10.877 --> 01:29:16.019]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal form it's like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[01:29:16.479 --> 01:29:17.199]  We're good to go!

[01:29:50.819 --> 01:29:52.581]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:29:52.701 --> 01:29:53.962]  Wake up and smell the fascism!
[01:29:54.182 --> 01:29:57.024]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:29:57.385 --> 01:30:00.107]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:30:00.666 --> 01:30:07.414]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:30:50.782 --> 01:30:54.646]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[01:30:54.906 --> 01:30:58.770]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[01:30:59.151 --> 01:31:04.156]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[01:31:04.436 --> 01:31:11.584]  Electrolyzed plus water will alkalize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens.
[01:31:11.824 --> 01:31:15.626]  Become allergic or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[01:31:15.947 --> 01:31:20.289]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and environmentally safe for humans and animals.
[01:31:20.529 --> 01:31:29.815]  Alkaline water is available as a concentrate to be mixed with good, filtered, purified RO water but not tap water, microstructured alkaline antioxidant water for consumption.

[01:31:41.368 --> 01:31:43.010]  That's N-U-T-R-I with an I, Medical.com.
[01:32:06.036 --> 01:32:07.396]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:07.416 --> 01:32:09.577]  We're talking to Raymond Schwab and Elliot Nash.
[01:32:09.697 --> 01:32:16.959]  They are two young men out there doing what preachers and pastors and Christians should be doing is just out walking and talking to people.
[01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:25.562]  Not in big multi-million dollar churches wearing little pimp suits and pinky rings and you know constantly eating breath mints and little twinkle eyes.
[01:32:27.044 --> 01:32:31.568]  Gentlemen, also on this video, it's really a great video you guys put together on the road.
[01:32:32.089 --> 01:32:36.252]  You go into a church, you're talking to a preacher, and he's like, no, there's no sacrifice to be a Christian.
[01:32:36.632 --> 01:32:39.475]  No, it's not a blessing to stand up against evil and be persecuted.
[01:32:40.596 --> 01:32:42.217]  No, it's all about blessings.
[01:32:42.257 --> 01:32:44.639]  God doesn't ever do anything bad to anybody of their evil.
[01:32:44.879 --> 01:32:45.880]  There's no judgments.
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:47.461]  Well, my gosh, cause and effect!
[01:32:48.122 --> 01:32:49.963]  Even Christians know that's real.
[01:32:50.724 --> 01:32:52.906]  I mean, it's the laws of the world that God set up.
[01:32:53.817 --> 01:32:56.659]  I mean, but that's your mainline preacher.
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:59.641]  He's got his hair quaffed just perfectly.
[01:32:59.661 --> 01:33:01.702]  You can tell he put mousse in it for like three hours.
[01:33:02.222 --> 01:33:04.064]  And he's got the little suit on just right.
[01:33:04.104 --> 01:33:06.225]  It's just all about feeling good.
[01:33:06.265 --> 01:33:08.166]  These churches are mortuaries.
[01:33:08.767 --> 01:33:10.808]  And meanwhile, they won't decry the war.
[01:33:10.868 --> 01:33:11.989]  They won't decry lies.
[01:33:12.029 --> 01:33:14.190]  They won't get out and protest abortion.
[01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:15.391]  They do nothing, do they?
[01:33:16.431 --> 01:33:16.992]  No, they don't.
[01:33:17.915 --> 01:33:22.038]  We've seen that there's a famine of God's Word as we've traveled across the country.
[01:33:22.779 --> 01:33:28.264]  Psalm 917 says, the wicked shall be turned into hell, and the nations that forget God.
[01:33:28.924 --> 01:33:34.729]  And we've just seen that there is a famine of God's Word, and people aren't speaking the truth.
[01:33:34.869 --> 01:33:40.454]  Even the Bible says that you are blessed if you're beheaded for the testimony of Christ, for instance.
[01:33:42.055 --> 01:33:44.337]  And you've got preachers denying that.
[01:33:44.377 --> 01:33:46.139]  I mean, that is a staple of the Gospel.
[01:33:47.035 --> 01:33:50.896]  And of course, you know, he saw there with him those that have been beheaded.
[01:33:51.576 --> 01:33:53.217]  And that preacher just says, no, that's not true.
[01:33:53.237 --> 01:33:53.917]  It doesn't exist.
[01:33:55.437 --> 01:33:55.798]  Sure.
[01:33:55.998 --> 01:33:58.258]  And actually, we didn't put the clip of his wife.
[01:33:58.338 --> 01:34:00.279]  I caught his wife outside and interviewed her.
[01:34:00.879 --> 01:34:05.400]  And, um, you know, she just, you know, I said, what do you think about the war in Iraq?
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.701]  She said, I support my president a hundred percent.
[01:34:08.081 --> 01:34:09.081]  I said, what about the lives?
[01:34:09.121 --> 01:34:10.302]  What about the people dying?
[01:34:10.322 --> 01:34:13.183]  She said, you know, we just got to trust in God and pray for them.
[01:34:13.243 --> 01:34:14.683]  And it's like, but what can you do?
[01:34:15.424 --> 01:34:18.765]  You know, it's all these carbon copy, risk-free answers.
[01:34:20.685 --> 01:34:27.527]  Look, Nero and Caligula would have had no problem with modern day Christians.
[01:34:28.728 --> 01:34:30.228]  Absolutely not, and that's what I ask.
[01:34:30.248 --> 01:34:37.770]  What if you're living under Adolf Hitler, would you turn in Jews and put Jews in camps, or would you resist these things like people like Bonhoeffer and other
[01:34:38.514 --> 01:34:41.737]  People that stood against the evil and paid, you know, with their life.
[01:34:41.817 --> 01:34:45.481]  And she was just like, I pray God this doesn't put me in that situation.
[01:34:46.001 --> 01:34:46.942]  It was very disheartening.
[01:34:47.062 --> 01:34:53.028]  I know, to see our fellow Americans turn into the ultimate chicken necks is just unbelievable.
[01:34:54.784 --> 01:34:59.046]  It is sad, and I just hope that people start waking up, and that's part of what we're trying to do.
[01:34:59.066 --> 01:35:04.688]  Well, what people don't know, what people don't know is when you are a weakling coward, the wolves come.
[01:35:05.228 --> 01:35:11.030]  They think they're safe being little cowards, little feel-good ninnies, and that's not how the world works.
[01:35:14.231 --> 01:35:22.434]  No, and Jesus, Jesus was a strong man, you know, Jesus paid with his life for our sins as well as for the truth.
[01:35:23.035 --> 01:35:30.116]  And those that were of the religious institutions that were just making their buck, they hated them, and they persecuted them, and they scorned them.
[01:35:30.676 --> 01:35:34.217]  And, you know, we're just challenging Christians out there to get out there in their churches.
[01:35:34.617 --> 01:35:35.837]  You know, get some of these videos.
[01:35:35.857 --> 01:35:38.758]  We've also made a documentary on 9-11 and the war in Iraq.
[01:35:38.818 --> 01:35:40.458]  Yeah, give your website out.
[01:35:41.038 --> 01:35:44.679]  Yeah, our website is baitshalomministries.org.
[01:35:44.699 --> 01:35:46.619]  I think you have a link on InfoWars.
[01:35:46.859 --> 01:35:48.479]  Yeah, what does that mean in Hebrew?
[01:35:48.559 --> 01:35:49.100]  I'm ignorant.
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:51.640]  Just House of Peace, House of Wholeness.
[01:35:53.638 --> 01:35:54.399]  Well, that's good.
[01:35:54.519 --> 01:35:56.642]  Well, listen, I commend what both of you are doing.
[01:35:56.662 --> 01:35:58.724]  I want to play another clip here for just a moment.
[01:35:58.744 --> 01:36:01.067]  And again, go to their website at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:01.647 --> 01:36:02.448]  We do have a link to it.
[01:36:02.468 --> 01:36:03.229]  I was on it last night.
[01:36:03.269 --> 01:36:04.010]  It's a good site.
[01:36:04.551 --> 01:36:06.573]  Again, that's InfoWars.com.
[01:36:06.593 --> 01:36:08.716]  You can link over to Beit Shalom.
[01:36:09.791 --> 01:36:11.492]  But let's go ahead and play a clip.
[01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:14.573]  Now set this up for us, either Raymond or Elliot.
[01:36:14.813 --> 01:36:28.498]  You're just out in the middle of nowhere and there's a sign that says, you know, impeach Bill Clinton, stop the New World Order, and then just some older gentleman just shows up and starts basically laying down the wisdom.
[01:36:28.998 --> 01:36:30.619]  Tell us about where this was and what happened.
[01:36:31.759 --> 01:36:33.520]  Yeah, that was Bernie Smith.
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:38.702]  I believe we were in Colorado still, and he said his
[01:36:39.446 --> 01:36:41.066]  You can look at his face and tell us the truth.
[01:36:41.086 --> 01:36:43.307]  I've seen so many things like this happen in the past.
[01:36:43.327 --> 01:36:45.047]  I mean, it's been in the newspaper.
[01:36:45.087 --> 01:36:46.808]  They arrest our listeners for having Ron Paul videos?
[01:37:05.684 --> 01:37:09.846]  They arrest people for having signs in their yard that say our judicial system's a joke?
[01:37:11.447 --> 01:37:19.791]  And he was a genuine individual, Alex, and it just shows that people think all the corruption is in the big towns, but like I said, the whole body is sick right now.
[01:37:19.811 --> 01:37:23.332]  And the small towns are following the same police state tactics.
[01:37:23.752 --> 01:37:25.873]  You know, they're getting their marching orders from somewhere.
[01:37:25.913 --> 01:37:26.974]  They're not just creating this.
[01:37:26.994 --> 01:37:28.995]  I mean, it's like carbon copies these experiences.
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:33.683]  In any city, in any state that we've been to so far, and it's good to meet men like him.
[01:37:33.723 --> 01:37:38.887]  They refresh us to know there's other people out there, that even in the smallest area, they're waking people up to the truth.
[01:37:40.768 --> 01:37:47.193]  And you guys, I mean, while you go through this persecution, you talk about how it's a blessing, and I can see how it's refreshing you.
[01:37:47.473 --> 01:37:51.096]  I don't think some of the listeners understand, it's good to stand up against evil.
[01:37:51.136 --> 01:37:52.237]  We're designed to do it.
[01:37:53.678 --> 01:37:53.938]  Right.
[01:37:54.078 --> 01:37:55.199]  I agree.
[01:37:55.399 --> 01:37:56.200]  Law in our hearts.
[01:37:57.355 --> 01:38:02.256]  God is love, and the only way to overcome evil is with good and with love.
[01:38:02.356 --> 01:38:05.957]  And Jesus said, blessed are you when you are persecuted for righteousness' sake.
[01:38:06.217 --> 01:38:08.938]  And you've got to have the willingness to put yourself in front of the enemy.
[01:38:10.879 --> 01:38:14.120]  But that's the greatest love, Alex, is to lay down our life for our friends.
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:22.622]  That's what Jesus said, is to lay down our life to stand in between the evil and others and do what's right, even if it costs us everything.
[01:38:22.642 --> 01:38:24.823]  And that's what we're trying to do.
[01:38:24.863 --> 01:38:26.103]  We're not shooting our hornets.
[01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:32.596]  We just figure someone has to be out there, and we don't feel the leaders in our churches are doing it, so we hit the streets to do it.
[01:38:32.616 --> 01:38:34.337]  Well, I want to be clear about this.
[01:38:34.477 --> 01:38:38.761]  Well, God bless you for that, and everybody should pray for you, because it is dangerous now to do this.
[01:38:38.861 --> 01:38:41.624]  And nothing against the hard-working illegal aliens.
[01:38:41.704 --> 01:38:44.987]  Most of them are good people, and I actually, you know, like them in a lot of respects.
[01:38:45.407 --> 01:38:50.288]  But my point is, they're being used as a tool to break down the sovereignty for this New World Order.
[01:38:50.688 --> 01:38:55.830]  And I'm sorry, the illegal aliens can walk around anywhere they want in the country, and they're totally left alone.
[01:38:56.350 --> 01:38:59.291]  And it's citizens who are harassed.
[01:38:59.431 --> 01:39:02.032]  And by that I mean black, white, Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[01:39:02.312 --> 01:39:03.432]  Do you want to comment on that?
[01:39:07.313 --> 01:39:08.293]  I agree with you, Alex.
[01:39:08.393 --> 01:39:14.655]  And, you know, we challenge them on these issues, and I don't know really what the policy
[01:39:15.519 --> 01:39:40.157]  is with these police departments where they're getting their their orders from but you know you don't even need as much ID to get an ID in this country as you do if you're an illegal immigrant you know you have to have mountains of evidence to prove your citizenship you know and they seem to be just skirting by all these things but we're talking about this war on terror but it seems to be a war on the American people our borders are open
[01:39:41.553 --> 01:39:48.058]  You know, we come from a heavy immigration area, and it just seems that people don't have the struggle in these issues as we do.
[01:39:48.938 --> 01:39:59.305]  But I do know this, that for the people that come out and help us, I've had help from people that I don't think, you know, that were migrant workers and things like that, that give us thumbs up and they understand what's going on.
[01:39:59.706 --> 01:40:00.967]  Oh, no, I know.
[01:40:00.987 --> 01:40:07.191]  I mean, this is kind of the... I don't want to say dichotomy.
[01:40:07.431 --> 01:40:08.512]  It's almost like a paradox.
[01:40:09.834 --> 01:40:14.316]  I personally have nothing against the illegal aliens.
[01:40:14.496 --> 01:40:29.363]  You know, they're family people, they're hard-working, they know about the New World Order, but then at the same time, the New World Order is going to use them to drive down the wages and break down the country, and then brainwash their children to be anti-gun and pro-New World Order.
[01:40:29.983 --> 01:40:37.346]  Sure, you can't check a... You know, there's laws in Colorado where we're from where you can't ask a person's immigration status, but
[01:40:37.762 --> 01:40:50.288]  You know, you saw in Colby, Colorado, when we refused to give our last name, they surround us, the guy turns on his taser, they get out cameras, what's your last name, and we're just like, or Colby, Kansas, and we're just like, you know, what is all this?
[01:40:50.348 --> 01:40:54.210]  We don't have roles, we're doing it, you know, they say you're suspicious.
[01:40:54.390 --> 01:41:01.393]  By the way, we've got video of a girl on the ground, and she's refusing to let them carry her off, so they use pain submission,
[01:41:02.242 --> 01:41:02.962]  So, what's the history
[01:41:31.522 --> 01:41:35.504]  Okay, the sign we found out here in the middle of Kansas says Impeach Clinton.
[01:41:35.524 --> 01:41:36.405]  Colorado.
[01:41:36.505 --> 01:41:40.527]  Yeah, we're at the most eastern part of Colorado.
[01:41:40.607 --> 01:41:41.448]  Impeach Clinton.
[01:41:42.529 --> 01:41:44.129]  Stop New World Order.
[01:41:44.230 --> 01:41:45.190]  Keep our Republic.
[01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:46.271]  Liberty and Freedom.
[01:41:46.731 --> 01:41:52.514]  We met this gentleman who gave us a generous donation and has some history about that sign.
[01:41:52.554 --> 01:41:54.195]  You want to share the history and give us your name?
[01:41:54.295 --> 01:41:56.737]  Okay, Bernie Smith is my name.
[01:41:57.097 --> 01:41:58.138]  I moved out here around 1962 and
[01:42:01.047 --> 01:42:04.268]  My father-in-law now was the chapter leader for the Birch Society.
[01:42:05.128 --> 01:42:13.411]  I was even shocked to see people out here burning the signs down, terrorizing the family out on the farm.
[01:42:14.311 --> 01:42:16.452]  It was quite an ordeal.
[01:42:17.112 --> 01:42:18.473]  I thought they were crazy out here.
[01:42:20.393 --> 01:42:28.736]  Anyhow, the signs were either burnt or cut down or paint threw on them like that.
[01:42:29.671 --> 01:42:30.812]  You say they tried to hang him?
[01:42:31.112 --> 01:42:34.935]  At one time they tried to lynch him.
[01:42:36.677 --> 01:42:42.922]  The people, they thought he was a communist, you know, these outfits, you know.
[01:42:43.882 --> 01:42:50.628]  Now again, he's anti-communist, John Bircher, anti-Bill Clinton, and the locals wanted to hang him as a communist.
[01:42:50.668 --> 01:42:52.529]  See, they're totally brainwashed.
[01:42:52.869 --> 01:42:53.730]  Let's go back to the clip.
[01:42:54.651 --> 01:42:55.812]  It was an anti-job.
[01:42:56.864 --> 01:42:57.705]  Oh yeah, well back that up.
[01:42:57.725 --> 01:42:58.525]  I want people to hear that.
[01:42:58.985 --> 01:43:00.886]  You know, they say, hey, do you know 9-11 is an inside job?
[01:43:00.906 --> 01:43:01.367]  Do you know about 9-11?
[01:43:01.387 --> 01:43:02.307]  This is what he says.
[01:43:02.347 --> 01:43:02.667]  Here it is.
[01:43:04.308 --> 01:43:04.908]  That's wisdom.
[01:43:04.928 --> 01:43:08.230]  It's that wisdom out in the Middle East in Colorado, huh brother?
[01:43:08.570 --> 01:43:08.771]  Amen.
[01:43:09.751 --> 01:43:11.772]  And there's not too many of us that really pay attention.
[01:43:11.792 --> 01:43:12.192]  No, no, no, no.
[01:43:12.232 --> 01:43:12.693]  Back it up.
[01:43:12.733 --> 01:43:16.455]  We need to rewind that because I hit pause and it's still been rolling.
[01:43:16.515 --> 01:43:17.835]  Back it up about 30 seconds or so.
[01:43:17.875 --> 01:43:20.937]  I want them to hear him ask the question about 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:43:21.657 --> 01:43:22.818]  Whenever you're ready, go ahead and roll it.
[01:43:25.046 --> 01:43:27.067]  So that one time they tried to try to lynch you.
[01:43:27.287 --> 01:43:29.167]  So you believe 9-11 was an inside job?
[01:43:29.187 --> 01:43:31.328]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:43:32.329 --> 01:43:33.469]  And so was Oklahoma City.
[01:43:34.329 --> 01:43:34.689]  Wisdom.
[01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.910]  That's wisdom.
[01:43:36.730 --> 01:43:39.191]  Is that wisdom out in the middle of eastern Colorado, huh brother?
[01:43:39.211 --> 01:43:39.831]  Amen.
[01:43:40.691 --> 01:43:45.733]  And there's not too many of us are really paying attention to it, you know, like Waco.
[01:43:46.173 --> 01:43:48.014]  They murdered those people, our government did, you know.
[01:43:51.878 --> 01:43:52.058]  What?
[01:43:52.439 --> 01:43:53.319]  Take the camera off.
[01:43:53.499 --> 01:43:54.160]  You're public.
[01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:54.680]  Yeah.
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:57.822]  Where are you guys going?
[01:43:59.363 --> 01:43:59.624]  D.C.
[01:44:00.064 --> 01:44:00.184]  D.C.
[01:44:00.204 --> 01:44:00.664]  Okay.
[01:44:01.945 --> 01:44:02.245]  Okay.
[01:44:02.886 --> 01:44:04.227]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:44:04.387 --> 01:44:05.327]  And now let's be clear.
[01:44:05.348 --> 01:44:09.651]  You guys are in parks trying to eat sandwiches and you're told to get out of town.
[01:44:13.293 --> 01:44:14.254]  Correct, Raymond and Elliot?
[01:44:15.094 --> 01:44:15.455]  What's that?
[01:44:16.255 --> 01:44:20.278]  You guys have also been out, like you said, in the middle of a park eating a sandwich and you've been told to get out of town.
[01:44:20.945 --> 01:44:30.790]  Right, I walked into the town of Solomon, sat down at a public park, and before I even took a bite of my apple, a cop drove up and he said, you need to get out of town.
[01:44:30.810 --> 01:44:32.351]  I said, am I breaking any law?
[01:44:32.471 --> 01:44:33.672]  And he said, you're loitering.
[01:44:34.532 --> 01:44:36.753]  And I said, no, I'm going to sit here.
[01:44:36.813 --> 01:44:38.474]  And he said, I need to see some ID.
[01:44:38.594 --> 01:44:39.395]  And I refused.
[01:44:40.155 --> 01:44:41.156]  And he got pretty angry.
[01:44:43.237 --> 01:44:45.318]  And now you're planning to let them arrest you, you said?
[01:44:46.044 --> 01:44:52.565]  Yeah, we talked to the Attorney General in Kansas and there is not a law that they can request our papers.
[01:44:53.065 --> 01:44:56.166]  So we're going to let them arrest us, detain us next time if need be.
[01:44:57.506 --> 01:45:00.487]  Yeah, and you know, I just encourage people out.
[01:45:00.567 --> 01:45:02.087]  We make sure we know the laws.
[01:45:02.147 --> 01:45:03.468]  We're trying to be humble.
[01:45:03.508 --> 01:45:08.269]  We're trying to be submissive within the boundaries of the Constitution and the laws of this land.
[01:45:08.849 --> 01:45:15.190]  And when they give us an unlawful order, like turn off the camera, we refuse because it's not a lawful order and we try to get them
[01:45:16.388 --> 01:45:22.811]  We're trying to help them recognize there's a higher law than their authority, which is the Constitution and the rule of law in this country.
[01:45:22.951 --> 01:45:29.533]  Well, I'll tell you, a lot of these cops are getting all red and puffing up to you, but as soon as you go, we're not allowed to walk down the street in America?
[01:45:29.613 --> 01:45:30.373]  Is this Russia?
[01:45:30.814 --> 01:45:35.335]  You can see quite a few of them really seem guilty when they go and get back in their cars.
[01:45:35.355 --> 01:45:37.996]  In fact, a few of them, I see a tear in their eye.
[01:45:38.296 --> 01:45:42.238]  Now, am I just seeing that on the video, or did a few of them look like they were about to choke up?
[01:45:43.135 --> 01:45:45.317]  No, they tremble when we have the camera.
[01:45:45.337 --> 01:45:53.564]  They don't really know what to do, and like you were talking about earlier, that one contact, this guy jumped out of a civilian minivan, not in uniform.
[01:45:53.604 --> 01:45:59.989]  He wouldn't show us his ID, identify himself as an officer, and he had a, I think a 9mm stuffed in his pants.
[01:46:02.411 --> 01:46:09.897]  And then he just continued to reach for his weapon the whole time, Alex, which is why we eventually shut the camera off that time, because I thought, this guy's going to end up shooting somebody.
[01:46:10.302 --> 01:46:10.642]  Oh yeah!
[01:46:10.682 --> 01:46:14.024]  We had a documentary crew with us and they were really nervous.
[01:46:14.484 --> 01:46:17.665]  After, after, you know, I walked up to them and I said, did you see him reaching for a gun?
[01:46:17.685 --> 01:46:19.986]  She was, the girl was just, she was half terrified.
[01:46:20.006 --> 01:46:21.647]  She was like, yeah, I can't believe that.
[01:46:21.667 --> 01:46:25.748]  Yeah, he's sitting there, but he starts grabbing his gun saying, I told you to turn the camera off!
[01:46:26.068 --> 01:46:27.249]  It's my privacy!
[01:46:27.549 --> 01:46:29.870]  I'm gonna cram a camera down your throat, boy!
[01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:32.651]  I'm gonna see your ID, but you ain't gonna look at me!
[01:46:34.332 --> 01:46:38.136]  And when we took it to the Sheriff, the Sheriff said, that's just how we do things around here.
[01:46:38.156 --> 01:46:41.619]  And I said, Sheriff, this is America and I don't care how you do things around here.
[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:42.740]  What he did was wrong.
[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:48.105]  I told the Sheriff, I said, if I had a concealed carry permit, we had $3,000 worth of equipment at that day.
[01:46:48.125 --> 01:46:50.988]  Cause that documentary crew, I said, that man would have grabbed for a gun.
[01:46:51.008 --> 01:46:53.070]  I could have drew on him and been lawful.
[01:46:53.130 --> 01:46:54.071]  I said, that's dangerous.
[01:46:54.091 --> 01:46:55.753]  He put us in a dangerous situation.
[01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:59.150]  You know, he didn't even have a badge on, just a guy in a marine hat.
[01:46:59.170 --> 01:47:00.051]  He could have been anybody.
[01:47:00.411 --> 01:47:05.533]  No, I mean, he's a guy in a wife-beater shirt with his belly hanging out, running around waving guns around.
[01:47:05.553 --> 01:47:06.653]  He's just, they're nuts, man.
[01:47:07.173 --> 01:47:12.535]  It was a very dangerous situation, but the Lord preserves us through these things, and, you know, we bless the man.
[01:47:12.555 --> 01:47:18.218]  We tell him we hope that he changes what he's doing, because it's wrong, and I hope people, you know, watch these videos.
[01:47:18.378 --> 01:47:21.879]  You guys were very humble to him, and when he left, you could tell he felt pathetic.
[01:47:23.925 --> 01:47:26.185]  Yeah, he was pretty, he was pretty humbled at the end.
[01:47:26.405 --> 01:47:28.806]  But, uh, cause we just kept talking calmly to him.
[01:47:29.406 --> 01:47:42.648]  And, and usually as long as we stay calm, uh, the situation normally diffuses except the one in Stockton where the guy just was so angry we wouldn't separate from the camera, put his hat on our camera, then the white man shows up, starts taking pictures of us.
[01:47:43.008 --> 01:47:44.509]  He harassed us till we left the town.
[01:47:45.829 --> 01:47:46.489]  He's the only one.
[01:47:47.049 --> 01:47:47.809]  What was he doing?
[01:47:49.730 --> 01:47:50.810]  He told us to leave town.
[01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:51.950]  He just came up, uh,
[01:47:52.612 --> 01:47:54.653]  Asked us for ID.
[01:47:54.713 --> 01:47:55.474]  We said no.
[01:47:55.554 --> 01:47:56.294]  There's no reason.
[01:47:56.314 --> 01:47:57.615]  We're just standing there with signs.
[01:47:57.695 --> 01:47:59.576]  He told us to shut off the camera.
[01:47:59.616 --> 01:48:00.037]  We said no.
[01:48:00.077 --> 01:48:01.177]  He put his hand on the camera.
[01:48:01.217 --> 01:48:01.978]  We moved the camera.
[01:48:01.998 --> 01:48:02.898]  Put his hat on the camera.
[01:48:02.918 --> 01:48:03.659]  We moved it again.
[01:48:04.059 --> 01:48:04.660]  Put his hand down.
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:06.501]  I told him, please don't touch our camera.
[01:48:07.101 --> 01:48:08.202]  Then he tried to separate us.
[01:48:08.222 --> 01:48:09.703]  He told me, he said, you come over here.
[01:48:09.723 --> 01:48:10.343]  I said no.
[01:48:10.423 --> 01:48:11.464]  I said, I haven't broken any laws.
[01:48:11.504 --> 01:48:12.945]  I don't feel comfortable being alone with you.
[01:48:12.985 --> 01:48:15.466]  If you're going to talk to me, you're going to talk to me in front of the camera.
[01:48:15.786 --> 01:48:18.748]  And he just, you watch, and he just paces back and forth like, what do I do?
[01:48:18.788 --> 01:48:19.689]  They're not listening to me.
[01:48:20.237 --> 01:48:20.558]  I think so.
[01:48:34.181 --> 01:48:42.664]  We're out of time gentlemen.
[01:48:42.724 --> 01:48:45.205]  We've got links to your website up on InfoWars.com.
[01:48:45.585 --> 01:48:48.486]  I'd like to get maybe a 30 minute weekly report.
[01:48:48.846 --> 01:48:55.428]  If you guys could just send me concisely, I know you're busy on the road editing this, just a few minutes each week I'd play it.
[01:48:56.068 --> 01:48:58.430]  And we'd like to give you guys as much support as we can.
[01:48:58.470 --> 01:49:04.916]  And I just sent two video cameras and batteries and bags and everything to Luke Radowski, who's going through even worse stuff.
[01:49:04.936 --> 01:49:08.058]  And they just pull up and say, I'm going to frame you for bombs on video.
[01:49:08.078 --> 01:49:11.181]  They'd be like a cop going, lookie what we got here!
[01:49:11.561 --> 01:49:15.344]  And pulling, you know, cocaine out of his pocket on camera and planting it on him.
[01:49:15.805 --> 01:49:17.406]  I mean, it's just that bad now.
[01:49:17.706 --> 01:49:19.748]  I just sent him a bunch of equipment because he has no money.
[01:49:19.868 --> 01:49:21.049]  I don't have that much capital.
[01:49:21.509 --> 01:49:22.670]  But who knows?
[01:49:22.710 --> 01:49:24.432]  Maybe I'll work on trying to get you guys
[01:49:25.112 --> 01:49:26.372]  See, they have a chip camera.
[01:49:26.392 --> 01:49:28.313]  It's just a chip with a camera wire.
[01:49:29.093 --> 01:49:31.674]  They will not see them, and it records like an hour on it.
[01:49:32.014 --> 01:49:34.335]  Pure gold to get these people.
[01:49:34.395 --> 01:49:36.215]  We haven't even bought one yet for ourselves.
[01:49:38.676 --> 01:49:42.777]  Gentlemen, I want to thank you both for coming on with us, and we'll all pray for you, okay?
[01:49:43.517 --> 01:49:43.857]  Thank you.
[01:49:43.877 --> 01:49:44.998]  Keep fighting the good fight, Alex.
[01:49:45.018 --> 01:49:45.958]  The Lord bless you.
[01:49:46.338 --> 01:49:47.899]  Thank you, Raymond and Elliot.
[01:49:47.919 --> 01:49:48.739]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:48.779 --> 01:49:49.259]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.138 --> 01:49:58.566]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:49:58.967 --> 01:50:06.578]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:14.354]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:14.754 --> 01:50:26.180]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:30.082]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:30.443 --> 01:50:32.384]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:32.724 --> 01:50:36.566]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:49.952 --> 01:51:51.693]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:51.893 --> 01:51:55.594]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:55.914 --> 01:51:58.135]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:51:58.655 --> 01:52:04.858]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:05.018 --> 01:52:09.919]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:19.063]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:52:55.743 --> 01:53:01.728]  John Harmon that runs the show was just asking me if I'd heard about the Loose Change being played on Virgin Atlantic aircraft.
[01:53:02.448 --> 01:53:06.631]  Yeah, I learned about that a couple weeks ago, but I was on at liberty to discuss it.
[01:53:06.931 --> 01:53:11.115]  And I have to tell you, when I heard it, I believed the Loose Change guys who I was meeting with.
[01:53:12.155 --> 01:53:16.799]  But it just sounded so crazy, I thought, huh, there it is on the Virgin Atlantic website.
[01:53:17.299 --> 01:53:19.341]  They are playing it in the in-flight movies.
[01:53:21.875 --> 01:53:25.220]  That's because everybody knows 9-11 is an inside job, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:26.482]  It's hit the mainstream.
[01:53:28.085 --> 01:53:31.330]  And we do have an article about that up on PrisonPlanet.com on the right hand side.
[01:53:32.199 --> 01:53:32.980]  Okay, here's the deal.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.642]  We're going to have wide open phones in the third hour.
[01:53:36.842 --> 01:53:37.983]  Wow, this show's gone by quick.
[01:53:38.003 --> 01:53:39.964]  That is coming up in just a few minutes.
[01:53:40.444 --> 01:53:51.732]  The toll-free number to join us, any caller, long-time caller, first-time callers, just have your points and questions ready because I'm going to attempt, but callers always bring up such important subjects, I then babble about it with them.
[01:53:51.752 --> 01:53:52.152]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:52.172 --> 01:53:52.272]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:52.412 --> 01:53:52.512]  Okay.
[01:54:03.661 --> 01:54:24.965]  I am going to go over more of the war news here in a moment, and then I'm going to cover the honeybee die-off, huge JFK developments, school district is now going to handguff students for minor offenses, ABC News, just a lot of important stuff that we will jam in in the third hour that's coming up.
[01:54:25.305 --> 01:54:29.686]  Before we do that, we are an hour and 55 minutes into this transmission against tyranny worldwide.
[01:54:31.133 --> 01:54:37.477]  I would really be missing the boat here if I didn't tell you we have powerful tools in the information war.
[01:54:37.537 --> 01:54:46.343]  We're now carrying on the online video and bookstore at infowars.com, debunking the 9-11 debunkers by G. Edward Griffin.
[01:54:46.423 --> 01:54:47.264]  G. Edward Griffin.
[01:54:47.284 --> 01:54:48.144]  David Ray Griffin.
[01:54:48.725 --> 01:54:49.365]  G. Edward Griffin.
[01:54:49.385 --> 01:54:52.287]  I was setting him up for a guest the other day, so I had that in my head.
[01:54:55.805 --> 01:54:56.185]  We're good to go.
[01:55:15.709 --> 01:55:27.052]  So we have a combo with his new film and his new book together where you can get them both together as a discount or just get the book or the film by themselves at the regular price at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:27.673 --> 01:55:35.875]  And your purchase of the books and videos doesn't just support us, it also supports the people that wrote the books and made the videos that we also carry.
[01:55:36.739 --> 01:55:39.861]  We don't sit here and bootleg them and then sell them to you like everybody else does.
[01:55:41.122 --> 01:55:49.787]  It's great to make copies of videos and get them out for free, but there's a lot of bootlegging that goes on and selling, and that really is counterproductive to the fight against the New World Order.
[01:55:50.667 --> 01:55:53.449]  People try to call in all the day and say, I'm selling your bootlegs!
[01:55:53.749 --> 01:55:55.010]  I'm going to plug it on your show!
[01:55:55.916 --> 01:55:59.577]  As much as I'd like to let you do that, I won't be here much longer if that continues.
[01:56:00.597 --> 01:56:03.337]  But to make a long story short, we need your support.
[01:56:03.837 --> 01:56:07.358]  We've got great books and videos that we carry and the 15 films I've made.
[01:56:07.398 --> 01:56:10.399]  The latest, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:56:10.779 --> 01:56:15.779]  We've got America, Freedom to Fascism for $9.95 when you get it with Terror Storm.
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:17.480]  We've got American Dictators for $5.95.
[01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:21.881]  We've got t-shirts, inside job t-shirts for $9.95.
[01:56:22.281 --> 01:56:23.841]  Ball caps for as low as, what, $7?
[01:56:25.729 --> 01:56:32.032]  There's a bunch of insane deals there, and it's all about the info war, and your purchase makes this show possible.
[01:56:32.472 --> 01:56:38.055]  So see it as a donation, as a contribution, when you go to the website and you get the books and videos.
[01:56:38.175 --> 01:56:39.276]  That does support us.
[01:56:39.376 --> 01:56:40.716]  So don't wait.
[01:56:41.977 --> 01:56:47.240]  If you've bought books and videos from us before, or different items, I want to thank you.
[01:56:47.260 --> 01:56:49.681]  We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, and I would ask you to think about
[01:56:50.759 --> 01:56:56.524]  Purchasing some of the books and videos yet again at InfoWars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:56:56.544 --> 01:57:01.987]  You can call, they can answer your questions, tell you about the different specials.
[01:57:02.027 --> 01:57:06.511]  Give them a call today 888-253-3139 or you can also, if you just want to send us a donation folks, we will spend it on the fight
[01:57:17.117 --> 01:57:22.098]  It's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:57:24.199 --> 01:57:27.640]  Again, if it means we'll get our projects done, go ahead and donate to us.
[01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:28.240]  Makes it easy.
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:34.321]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:34.661 --> 01:57:35.521]  Or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:46.738 --> 01:57:51.000]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:51.601 --> 01:57:52.421]  You want answers?
[01:57:53.161 --> 01:57:54.122]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:54.742 --> 01:57:58.364]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:58.904 --> 01:58:03.026]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:03.787 --> 01:58:08.569]  We're now into our number three, Dan Richard, Samantha, Tom, Rob.
[01:58:08.589 --> 01:58:10.810]  We're going to go to all of your calls in rapid succession.
[01:58:13.593 --> 01:58:14.554]  Suddenly I can't talk.
[01:58:15.314 --> 01:58:17.736]  And we've got a bunch of news coming up.
[01:58:17.836 --> 01:58:22.440]  Huge JFK developments on the heel of yesterday's developments.
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:23.541]  A lot of war news.
[01:58:23.601 --> 01:58:24.582]  It's all very important.
[01:58:24.982 --> 01:58:26.123]  Major honeybee news.
[01:58:26.583 --> 01:58:28.325]  Stay with us, but let's get through some calls first.
[01:58:28.905 --> 01:58:32.388]  Dan is calling us from New York.
[01:58:32.468 --> 01:58:33.549]  You're on the air, Dan.
[01:58:33.569 --> 01:58:37.152]  I'm told you're a friend of Luke Rudowsky, who's a reporter for this transmission.
[01:58:38.153 --> 01:58:38.513]  I am.
[01:58:38.593 --> 01:58:39.934]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:58:40.034 --> 01:58:40.875]  Yeah, what's on your mind today?
[01:58:41.821 --> 01:58:42.281]  Uh, nothing.
[01:58:42.341 --> 01:58:46.384]  I just wanted to call and share the experience of what took place on the 11th.
[01:58:46.904 --> 01:59:00.953]  Okay, for those who don't know, recap, you're down there in front of Silverstein Properties, the new Building 7, by Ground Zero, the police come up and start saying, he's got a bomb, he's got a bomb, I know you don't have a bomb, but we're going to say that and put you in jail.
[01:59:01.434 --> 01:59:03.415]  Now the police frame people on video, go ahead.
[01:59:04.474 --> 01:59:05.114]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:59:05.134 --> 01:59:06.976]  I mean, it was a very scary situation.
[01:59:06.996 --> 01:59:13.380]  You know, Luke had me hanging back, videotaping him from a distance just to make sure everything was okay.
[01:59:14.660 --> 01:59:21.685]  The shots that you see of Luke being, you know, when they took his camera and they took his cell phone, I was taking those shots.
[01:59:22.565 --> 01:59:29.550]  And, you know, it's just, the reason why I'm really calling is just to tell everyone it's so important to get out there and to do these street actions.
[01:59:30.194 --> 01:59:39.320]  And in that video, you can see, after we were at the Brooklyn Bridge, uh, we're walking down the street, heading up to Times Square, and you hear a bunch of kids going, hey, look at that sign.
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:42.662]  Um, we were just talking about how 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:59:43.183 --> 01:59:49.006]  And they stopped, and I started talking to them, and they were a bunch of, like, 18-, 19-year-old kids from Pennsylvania.
[01:59:49.026 --> 01:59:52.549]  They were in New York, just, uh, touring around, checking the city out.
[01:59:53.149 --> 01:59:58.753]  And I stopped and talked to them for a little, and I gave them about 20 copies of Terror Storm, 20 copies of Martial Law.
[01:59:59.728 --> 02:00:02.450]  And just started to tell them that they need to educate themselves.
[02:00:03.190 --> 02:00:09.234]  And it was an interesting day, because almost 98% of that day, we were doing street action for probably about four to five hours.
[02:00:09.794 --> 02:00:11.555]  And I would say it was almost all negative.
[02:00:11.615 --> 02:00:15.738]  The response people were giving us, you guys are crazy, get out of here, you hate this country.
[02:00:16.358 --> 02:00:20.300]  And I was actually not even wanting, excuse me, to go up to Times Square.
[02:00:20.921 --> 02:00:24.903]  And thank God Luke and my boys, you know, they were like, we got to do this, we got to go up there.
[02:00:25.655 --> 02:00:36.578]  And they're so dedicated to what they do and you know it just shows that even if your whole day could be negative, it's just that one positive seed that you could plant.
[02:00:36.799 --> 02:00:51.743]  I mean it was that group of kids that changed my whole day because I got to speak to them and I know they're going to go back and talk to their friends and they're going to make them watch Terror Storm, make them watch Martial Law and get informed and that's where it really starts.
[02:00:51.823 --> 02:00:53.764]  It starts with the youth and it starts
[02:00:55.206 --> 02:00:57.030]  That's the thing about a day, too.
[02:00:57.110 --> 02:01:03.562]  I might go out doing something like that and 80% of the people hate me and then I go out another week and then everybody's agreeing.
[02:01:03.602 --> 02:01:05.446]  You never know what crowds you're going to run into.
[02:01:06.269 --> 02:01:07.050]  Not exactly.
[02:01:07.650 --> 02:01:12.575]  I just wanted to say thank you, Alex, for the donation and helping us out with the cameras.
[02:01:12.676 --> 02:01:14.377]  It's really going to help.
[02:01:14.517 --> 02:01:25.168]  And to everybody out there, from the bottom of our hearts, we've actually been getting donations since you've been helping us out from Germany, from Ireland, from Hawaii, including all over the country.
[02:01:26.189 --> 02:01:34.216]  Yeah, I just want to tell everyone, we promise, every single cent will be going towards getting flyers made, getting the DVDs made.
[02:01:34.316 --> 02:01:36.998]  I've personally made thousands of copies of your videos.
[02:01:38.039 --> 02:01:41.422]  But on the same hand, I try and help you out and try and support you.
[02:01:41.442 --> 02:01:44.564]  I own probably 80% of the info or shop at this point.
[02:01:45.044 --> 02:01:46.566]  It's such valuable information.
[02:01:47.266 --> 02:01:58.456]  And, um, you know, it's just so important for everybody to support Alex Jones and support what he's doing because without Alex, we wouldn't have the ammo to go out there with these Infowar bombs and the truth bullets.
[02:01:58.537 --> 02:01:59.978]  So, um, I just wanted to say thank you.
[02:01:59.998 --> 02:02:01.519]  Well, listen, we're all on the same team.
[02:02:01.539 --> 02:02:11.348]  We're right beside each other in this fight, my friend, and it's all symbiotic, and that's what I'm here to do, is to try to bring support and energize different activist groups around the country.
[02:02:11.388 --> 02:02:13.290]  That's why it hurts my feelings so bad.
[02:02:14.059 --> 02:02:20.184]  When even people in my local community attack me and then try to say things about me that are the opposite of who I am.
[02:02:20.685 --> 02:02:27.010]  It's like they're really trying to even steal my very essence and, you know, take what I try to do and tarnish that.
[02:02:27.070 --> 02:02:28.191]  That's what makes me so sick.
[02:02:28.531 --> 02:02:29.051]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:02:29.091 --> 02:02:30.913]  We have to ignore those people and move forward.
[02:02:31.353 --> 02:02:32.554]  Good to hear from you, Dan.
[02:02:32.574 --> 02:02:33.395]  Hope to meet you soon.
[02:02:33.435 --> 02:02:35.337]  See you again soon in New York.
[02:02:35.717 --> 02:02:37.498]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[02:02:37.538 --> 02:02:37.959]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.766 --> 02:02:51.233]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:51.594 --> 02:02:59.224]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:59.938 --> 02:03:07.003]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:07.384 --> 02:03:18.832]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:19.132 --> 02:03:22.615]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:23.095 --> 02:03:25.017]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:25.357 --> 02:03:29.200]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:42.674 --> 02:03:45.857]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:45.897 --> 02:03:49.920]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:50.060 --> 02:03:52.622]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:52.682 --> 02:03:55.024]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:55.204 --> 02:04:03.651]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:03.711 --> 02:04:05.032]  The Brooklyn Light is different.
[02:04:05.172 --> 02:04:09.155]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:09.155 --> 02:04:09.676]  We're good to go!

[02:04:34.284 --> 02:04:35.245]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:42.438 --> 02:04:46.701]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:04:46.961 --> 02:04:51.845]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:04:52.065 --> 02:04:53.406]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:53.566 --> 02:04:56.908]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:05:17.339 --> 02:05:18.279]  No animal testing.
[02:05:18.539 --> 02:05:19.860]  I use them and love them.
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:21.481]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:05:21.761 --> 02:05:22.881]  And I save big time.

[02:05:46.850 --> 02:05:47.530]  Big Brother.
[02:05:48.150 --> 02:05:49.211]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:49.911 --> 02:05:51.031]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:51.692 --> 02:05:52.532]  You want answers?
[02:05:53.252 --> 02:05:54.172]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:54.813 --> 02:05:58.754]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.994 --> 02:06:03.056]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:04.501 --> 02:06:06.263]  I was talking to Dan during the break.
[02:06:06.303 --> 02:06:08.746]  I said I was going to go quickly to calls, but it's so important.
[02:06:08.926 --> 02:06:10.748]  I think I've met Dan.
[02:06:10.908 --> 02:06:12.750]  Last year's remembrance there in New York.
[02:06:13.490 --> 02:06:16.694]  But Dan said that after they came on the show, after Luke did a
[02:06:17.472 --> 02:06:18.853]  Last week, huge response.
[02:06:19.414 --> 02:06:23.738]  Said a Gulf War vet with his family came up from Miami, gave him an $1,100 spy camera.
[02:06:24.278 --> 02:06:25.460]  Gee, I don't have one of those yet.
[02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:30.604]  And that's great because they really are the heart and soul of 9-11 Truth in New York.
[02:06:30.644 --> 02:06:34.728]  They're the activists, they're having the effect and it always happens in every major group.
[02:06:35.068 --> 02:06:39.833]  You know, there have been splits and things because some folks locally don't like them getting into the anti-New World Order thing.
[02:06:40.313 --> 02:06:43.056]  And so Luke and them went off on their own and absolutely had nothing.
[02:06:43.696 --> 02:06:45.757]  And so I guess, see, we all just plant that seed.
[02:06:45.797 --> 02:06:48.618]  I just mailed them two brand new Sony cameras.
[02:06:49.399 --> 02:06:53.221]  And I just went to Best Buy the other night and bought them and shipped them to them yesterday.
[02:06:53.741 --> 02:06:55.482]  And somebody else has already come in and helping them.
[02:06:55.502 --> 02:06:58.983]  So they've got what they need to get this information out to people.
[02:06:59.503 --> 02:07:08.187]  But finishing up, tell the story about, without giving his name, he may not want it to be public, about the vet who came up with his family to New York and how you guys went out to ground zero.
[02:07:08.528 --> 02:07:09.288]  Tell folks about that.
[02:07:10.273 --> 02:07:21.438]  Yeah, he heard Luke on the show the other week, last week, and was actually planning on coming up to New York anyway with his family, and just wanted to come down and help, and it really was amazing.
[02:07:21.478 --> 02:07:25.939]  He came down to Ground Zero from 1 to 4 every week.
[02:07:26.019 --> 02:07:29.661]  Luke and the boys were all down there at Ground Zero outside handing information out.
[02:07:30.374 --> 02:07:50.929]  Uh, he came up to us and just introduced himself, said he was a Gulf War 1 Desert Storm vet, um, and knew all about, you know, New World Order, big listener of you, Alex, and, um, just wanted to help us out and help support us, because, you know, he'd heard of all the stuff we were going through, and that we had lost everything, and that we were doing everything out of pocket.
[02:07:51.810 --> 02:07:54.555]  Um, and just really was an amazing individual.
[02:07:54.595 --> 02:07:55.516]  A beautiful soul.
[02:07:55.536 --> 02:07:57.540]  Uh, was there with his wife and kid.
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:07:58.661]  We didn't get to meet them.
[02:07:58.721 --> 02:08:00.244]  They were out touring the city, but um...
[02:08:00.984 --> 02:08:03.905]  You know, I just, if you're listening, I just wanted to say thank you.
[02:08:04.226 --> 02:08:11.829]  And like I said before, thank you to everybody, because without your support, you know, we just wouldn't have the ability.
[02:08:12.290 --> 02:08:16.772]  It's one thing to go out there and to talk to people, but it's another thing to be able to give them information.
[02:08:16.792 --> 02:08:18.093]  You know, we put a flyer together.
[02:08:18.113 --> 02:08:22.275]  Anybody can go to wearechange.org and download the flyer.
[02:08:22.635 --> 02:08:26.697]  It's an 8x14 trifold PDF, you know, and just print them out.
[02:08:27.217 --> 02:08:27.798]  Hand them out.
[02:08:28.158 --> 02:08:28.838]  That's what we do.
[02:08:28.918 --> 02:08:30.159]  We print our DVDs.
[02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:36.863]  That's the most important thing, just to keep distributing the information and planting the seeds.
[02:08:37.343 --> 02:08:44.468]  Even if people don't believe you right away, sooner or later they will see something that is like, hey, maybe that guy was right.
[02:08:44.708 --> 02:08:46.289]  Maybe I should start to look into this.
[02:08:46.669 --> 02:08:47.290]  Absolutely.
[02:08:47.770 --> 02:08:49.671]  Dan, I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:08:49.711 --> 02:08:51.232]  I hope to see you again in person soon.
[02:08:51.272 --> 02:08:51.752]  God bless.
[02:08:52.573 --> 02:08:53.193]  You too, Alex.
[02:08:53.233 --> 02:08:53.774]  God bless you.
[02:08:53.934 --> 02:08:54.274]  Take care.
[02:08:54.844 --> 02:08:56.926]  That is the fringe benefit of all this.
[02:08:56.986 --> 02:08:57.766]  I mean, it's tough.
[02:08:57.866 --> 02:08:59.127]  You get a lot of problems.
[02:09:00.228 --> 02:09:15.158]  There's adversity at times, but to meet the beautiful souls out there, to run into the like-minded people who love liberty and love freedom and love God and love their country, and who have the courage to cut to the propaganda, and who have the courage to sit there on a busy street.
[02:09:15.178 --> 02:09:22.843]  I mean, I remember five years ago coming out and saying that 9-11 was an inside job, and four years ago and three years ago having rallies.
[02:09:23.767 --> 02:09:25.609]  And, uh, you know, getting the heat.
[02:09:26.490 --> 02:09:29.173]  Uh, but it doesn't matter when you know you're doing the right thing.
[02:09:29.233 --> 02:09:31.155]  It means nothing when people spit at you.
[02:09:31.695 --> 02:09:32.896]  You just feel sorry for them.
[02:09:32.917 --> 02:09:34.198]  You understand they're brainwashed.
[02:09:35.459 --> 02:09:36.280]  So that is exciting.
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:37.261]  Alright, now let's move quick.
[02:09:37.341 --> 02:09:39.143]  Richard in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:09:40.061 --> 02:09:41.342]  Alex, a couple of things today.
[02:09:42.143 --> 02:09:52.971]  Night before last, Joe Scarborough just tore into Bush, calling now an extremely isolated man to his pronouncements years ago of the mission accomplished.
[02:09:52.991 --> 02:09:54.111]  Yeah, that's rats leaving.
[02:09:54.131 --> 02:09:57.454]  That's an embarrassing thing on a very badly going war.
[02:09:57.914 --> 02:10:06.941]  And it just seems like a lot of the old allies that he's got are increasingly jumping ship, and he's got to really be feeling like a cornered rat.
[02:10:07.581 --> 02:10:12.564]  And that in some ways is good, but in some ways pretty scary as far as what his reaction may be.
[02:10:12.864 --> 02:10:15.825]  Well, you're right, Richard, but they always do this.
[02:10:15.885 --> 02:10:34.234]  It's like Bill Clinton before he left office, and then you watch Hillary will pardon everybody in his administration, and she'll block the Democratic Congress, or Barack Obama, Edwards, it doesn't matter, will block the Congress just like George W. Bush did with Clinton for pardon, gate, and the rest of it.
[02:10:34.835 --> 02:10:36.357]  Uh, they will protect them.
[02:10:36.377 --> 02:10:38.822]  This is what they've always done.
[02:10:39.143 --> 02:10:40.726]  And so it's like birdcage liner.
[02:10:40.886 --> 02:10:44.613]  They're about to remove the final birdcage liner.
[02:10:44.893 --> 02:10:46.557]  And so before they put a new one in...
[02:10:47.452 --> 02:11:14.948]  They want to make sure that all of the bird detritus is left down there on the bottom, and so they're putting everything on Bush, and it's his fault we invaded Iraq, and it's his fault there's a new world order, and it's his fault we have the Patriot Act, but then none of it's repealed, none of it's removed, and then in the world's eyes, okay, America's okay now, and then they can move the next phase forward, and then blame it on Hillary, and then it's tag-team wrestling.
[02:11:15.368 --> 02:11:22.851]  Okay, the whole match is fake, and then they just have two different actors, two different teams tag-teaming, and I know you know that.
[02:11:23.451 --> 02:11:33.415]  I know you know it's a thespian adventure, a theatrical peacock display, but still, the general public doesn't know when Neil Bortz and Rush Limbaugh get up and say,
[02:11:34.705 --> 02:11:40.590]  Iran is behind Al-Qaeda, and we have to stay in Iraq, or Al-Qaeda will take over with Iran.
[02:11:41.050 --> 02:11:45.073]  They don't know that Iran and Al-Qaeda are immortal enemies, and that that's a complete fraud.
[02:11:45.834 --> 02:11:59.064]  And that it's those two religious groups, subgroups, Shiite and Sunni, fighting each other tooth and nail, there right now, or that special ops helped trigger all of that, or that they want there to be a quagmire as a pretext to stay there longer.
[02:11:59.345 --> 02:12:00.946]  The basic common sense
[02:12:01.486 --> 02:12:03.047]  of problem reaction solution.
[02:12:03.327 --> 02:12:06.908]  The whole world system is unknown to the general public.
[02:12:07.208 --> 02:12:22.352]  The actual laws of government and the laws and the main drive that pushes and directs everything that the New World Order's dark forces and their dark generals and their servants operate in is totally unknown to the public.
[02:12:22.672 --> 02:12:23.872]  We have to change that.
[02:12:24.232 --> 02:12:25.433]  Then everything makes sense.
[02:12:25.493 --> 02:12:26.893]  The drug war, the open borders,
[02:12:27.814 --> 02:12:32.278]  You know, put more kids on Prozac, more shootings, put more kids on Prozac to stop the shootings.
[02:12:32.579 --> 02:12:34.441]  It's all problem, reaction, solution.
[02:12:34.461 --> 02:12:34.801]  Go ahead.
[02:12:35.402 --> 02:12:37.144]  All interconnected, as you mentioned earlier.
[02:12:37.404 --> 02:12:48.896]  Alex, just quickly on the local scene, I think I noticed the day before yesterday as well that you're no longer on the RBN local broadcast 96.3, and I'd also be interested to hear what happened to Kevin Smith.
[02:12:49.981 --> 02:12:51.482]  Okay, I appreciate your call.
[02:12:51.742 --> 02:12:57.965]  Number one, I'm on KLBJ 590 Sundays here in Austin, Texas.
[02:12:58.525 --> 02:13:01.827]  I've been on KJFK 98.9, changed formats, went Spanish.
[02:13:02.307 --> 02:13:06.730]  I was on News Talk 1260 for a couple of years and then it changed to sports.
[02:13:08.150 --> 02:13:15.494]  They offered me five days a week on KLBJ, one of the biggest stations in Texas, a very successful number one station here locally.
[02:13:16.229 --> 02:13:17.630]  But they wanted me to do a live show.
[02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:19.610]  I can't do two shows a day anymore.
[02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:20.170]  Live.
[02:13:20.231 --> 02:13:21.891]  I'm a filmmaker.
[02:13:21.931 --> 02:13:22.992]  I'm doing ten other things.
[02:13:23.492 --> 02:13:26.013]  I do the work of five people myself.
[02:13:26.773 --> 02:13:30.214]  And so I'm only on locally Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:13:30.234 --> 02:13:34.136]  It's a syndicated show, but you can hear it on NewsRadio 590K LBJ.
[02:13:34.716 --> 02:13:37.777]  People always think that I run those micros.
[02:13:39.153 --> 02:13:43.598]  Uh, or that those, and I, then I say pirate and that makes the micros mad.
[02:13:43.939 --> 02:13:47.163]  I have to use, like I'm speaking to Greeks, I have to use the Greek word.
[02:13:47.583 --> 02:13:48.584]  They know it as pirates.
[02:13:48.644 --> 02:13:49.786]  And then I introduce them.
[02:13:50.046 --> 02:13:53.951]  First I show them a semantical symbol that they understand.
[02:13:54.111 --> 02:13:56.114]  I'm explaining this because I get attacked whenever I do this.
[02:13:56.892 --> 02:14:00.413]  The symbol they know, verbally, is pirate radio.
[02:14:00.814 --> 02:14:06.896]  Then I introduce them to the proper term, micro or community FM, and then now I can move forward.
[02:14:06.916 --> 02:14:12.178]  I'm actually, it doesn't matter, every time I call it pirate I get vicious emails and stuff.
[02:14:12.878 --> 02:14:14.319]  That's how I communicate with people.
[02:14:15.347 --> 02:14:28.036]  But I don't run that, I'm not affiliated with that, I'm not affiliated with other radio networks, and I don't even pay attention to that anymore because of some of the stuff going on here locally.
[02:14:28.076 --> 02:14:32.640]  I've just disengaged from all of it and just moved forward against the New World Order.
[02:14:33.580 --> 02:14:37.263]  As for people that have worked here, Kevin worked here for 14 months, he doesn't work here anymore.
[02:14:38.064 --> 02:14:40.085]  And that's all I'm going to say about it.
[02:14:40.565 --> 02:14:40.865]  Okay?
[02:14:41.385 --> 02:14:42.385]  All right.
[02:14:42.445 --> 02:14:46.446]  Let's go ahead and go to Samantha in Kansas.
[02:14:46.746 --> 02:14:47.866]  You're on the air, Samantha.
[02:14:47.906 --> 02:14:48.226]  Welcome.
[02:14:49.627 --> 02:14:49.967]  Hi.
[02:14:50.887 --> 02:14:53.908]  I've listened to your broadcast for quite some time now.
[02:14:54.688 --> 02:14:56.128]  And I live in western Kansas.
[02:14:57.068 --> 02:15:03.290]  And I was listening earlier with the gentleman walking and going across western Kansas.
[02:15:04.702 --> 02:15:15.724]  And what they were talking about is only the tip of the iceberg to what happens from Nebraska, Eastern Colorado, Western Kansas, Oklahoma panhandle and into the Texas panhandle.
[02:15:16.844 --> 02:15:25.406]  We are overwhelmed with illegals and the police department has their hands tied.
[02:15:25.626 --> 02:15:27.987]  You call them, they can't do anything.
[02:15:32.617 --> 02:15:34.400]  It's just a backward mentality here.
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:37.445]  I moved here from a large town and I was in culture shock.
[02:15:38.250 --> 02:15:40.112]  And still, I'm in culture shock.
[02:15:40.472 --> 02:15:44.175]  But they'll harass the locals, they'll write you tickets because you're the right whale.
[02:15:44.215 --> 02:15:47.358]  You're the sweet little whale that comes up to the boat and takes the harpoon.
[02:15:47.378 --> 02:15:50.840]  You're not, you know, a sperm whale that'll fight.
[02:15:51.281 --> 02:15:57.465]  And then the illegals, they've been told, and they're allowed to have bank accounts, they're given bank accounts, the police are told don't arrest them.
[02:15:57.485 --> 02:15:58.486]  This is on record now.
[02:15:58.786 --> 02:16:02.770]  They can have cocaine, rape, whatever, and it just shows it's not about keeping you safe.
[02:16:03.730 --> 02:16:06.913]  The police departments are parasitic, not in every place, but
[02:16:07.493 --> 02:16:09.834]  More and more are just parasitic organizations.
[02:16:11.035 --> 02:16:11.535]  Exactly.
[02:16:11.876 --> 02:16:16.278]  A small crack in my windshield that had happened the day before.
[02:16:16.298 --> 02:16:17.419]  I get pulled over.
[02:16:17.439 --> 02:16:18.819]  I know.
[02:16:18.899 --> 02:16:19.300]  I know.
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:24.342]  And the illegal aliens can smoke moto right there on the side of the street in a cobblestone ceiling.
[02:16:25.123 --> 02:16:25.823]  Oh yeah.
[02:16:26.403 --> 02:16:27.784]  I have two neighbors.
[02:16:28.344 --> 02:16:29.185]  They're illegal.
[02:16:29.405 --> 02:16:30.465]  I know that they're illegal.
[02:16:31.026 --> 02:16:32.086]  They've said that they're illegal.
[02:16:34.068 --> 02:16:37.090]  Have children that were born here not too long ago.
[02:16:38.752 --> 02:16:42.395]  And if you don't pay the property tax to put them through school, they'll come take your house.
[02:16:43.415 --> 02:16:45.837]  Oh yes, well the problem is they're illegal.
[02:16:45.937 --> 02:16:47.218]  They've admitted that they're illegal.
[02:16:47.779 --> 02:16:49.480]  They go down to the welfare office.
[02:16:49.921 --> 02:16:52.923]  They get public assistance.
[02:16:54.567 --> 02:16:58.289]  You're subsidizing the meat packing plant and the farms they work on.
[02:16:58.530 --> 02:17:06.055]  So the corporations wrote the laws where we, the dumb public, are here to be exsanguinated, to suck dry, to fund all this.
[02:17:06.075 --> 02:17:08.357]  Look, it's a simple problem-reaction solution.
[02:17:09.418 --> 02:17:09.818]  Exactly.
[02:17:10.138 --> 02:17:11.559]  And then they get fake IDs.
[02:17:11.819 --> 02:17:19.285]  The old saying out here is if your ID gets lost or stolen, it's going to be used within just a couple of hours by someone.
[02:17:19.952 --> 02:17:25.137]  They use a fake ID and go work in all these meatpacking plants out here while they're collecting welfare.
[02:17:26.037 --> 02:17:28.600]  Yeah, but see, it's all gonna fall apart.
[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:34.605]  And for all those corrupt cops, most of them dealing drugs on the side, you know, that's just the way it is.
[02:17:35.386 --> 02:17:36.246]  It's the end of America.
[02:17:36.286 --> 02:17:36.987]  Good job, men.
[02:17:37.287 --> 02:17:37.848]  You've killed us.
[02:17:42.625 --> 02:17:47.709]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:17:47.769 --> 02:17:55.094]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:17:55.234 --> 02:18:05.862]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:18:06.083 --> 02:18:10.606]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:18:10.886 --> 02:18:15.893]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:18:16.093 --> 02:18:19.036]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:18:19.257 --> 02:18:29.089]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[02:18:29.229 --> 02:18:31.371]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:31.391 --> 02:18:36.094]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:36.154 --> 02:18:38.115]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:38.135 --> 02:18:39.576]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:18:59.702 --> 02:19:04.305]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:05.225 --> 02:19:12.489]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:19:13.490 --> 02:19:16.552]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.

[02:19:44.167 --> 02:19:46.509]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:53.037]  Did you know that the United Nations' basic philosophy is both anti-American and pro-dictatorship?
[02:19:53.697 --> 02:20:03.008]  Did you know that the United Nations was founded by Communist and Marxist members of the Council on Foreign Relations, whose goal is a socialistic one-world government?

[02:21:51.667 --> 02:21:54.049]  Like, 15 massive news stories to cover.
[02:21:55.330 --> 02:21:58.712]  Including what Bobby Kennedy really thought about the JFK assassination.
[02:21:59.593 --> 02:22:01.654]  I mean, we got a Debra Rice that's an inside job.
[02:22:01.674 --> 02:22:04.156]  Now, we got the Attorney General who thought it was an inside job.
[02:22:04.716 --> 02:22:07.838]  But why he kept his mouth shut, he knew the dumbed-down public couldn't understand that.
[02:22:08.298 --> 02:22:10.520]  But now the public may be able to on 9-11.
[02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:15.623]  Uh, we're gonna go to Tom and Alex and, uh, John and a couple others.
[02:22:15.704 --> 02:22:17.225]  John in Michigan, I'm told, disagrees.
[02:22:17.625 --> 02:22:19.146]  Go ahead, John, you're at the front of the line.
[02:22:19.682 --> 02:22:23.144]  Yes, about Boris Yeltsin and the World Can't Wait organization.
[02:22:24.105 --> 02:22:33.752]  First about Boris Yeltsin, he was a good man at some point, especially later on in his life, but in the 1970s he was implicit in the Anthrax cover-up of the release by
[02:22:34.639 --> 02:22:36.620]  They're major anthrax producers.
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:37.580]  Sure, sure, I've read that.
[02:22:38.121 --> 02:22:43.243]  And he, in fact, used that as an opportunity to go after his enemies and the enemies of the Communist Party.
[02:22:43.283 --> 02:22:46.345]  Yeah, they had an anthrax weapons production facility.
[02:22:46.365 --> 02:22:48.086]  Some got out, killed like 40-something people.
[02:22:48.686 --> 02:22:52.768]  Yeah, in fact, a book by a guy named Ken Alback, who ran the Soviet program.
[02:22:52.808 --> 02:22:53.868]  Yeah, bioweapons, yeah.
[02:22:53.889 --> 02:22:58.571]  Yeah, so I wrote about that saying that this man, you know, is about as dirty as they come.
[02:22:59.535 --> 02:23:04.218]  His connections with the Communist Party... Let's just go back here for a moment, because you don't disagree with me.
[02:23:04.818 --> 02:23:13.083]  What I said was, is I talked about one guy on top of a tank, and the people resonating with that courage, just like Ceausescu fell in Romania.
[02:23:13.443 --> 02:23:19.266]  That's all I was talking about, and I said Yeltsin was involved in all sorts of corruption, and I made that clear.
[02:23:19.547 --> 02:23:22.468]  And the bigger one, though, is the World Can't Wait organization.
[02:23:22.488 --> 02:23:28.932]  I find them more about... I can't believe how much a stinks of New World Order control
[02:23:29.676 --> 02:23:33.737]  Because of the fact that they are openly pro-abortion and pro-gay rights.
[02:23:34.237 --> 02:23:37.138]  I mean, you know, marriage and the destruction of the family.
[02:23:37.318 --> 02:23:37.938]  What are you saying?
[02:23:37.978 --> 02:23:39.639]  I did my role, can't wait.
[02:23:39.679 --> 02:23:43.920]  You're supportive of their activist that went on Bill O'Reilly's show.
[02:23:43.940 --> 02:23:45.340]  Sure, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:23:45.581 --> 02:23:47.601]  I'm not going to get caught up in this left-right stuff.
[02:23:48.241 --> 02:23:50.622]  I'm on air saying abortion's wrong last hour.
[02:23:51.613 --> 02:23:58.299]  Okay, and this is not some inquisition where I sit up here and then I'm judged by everyone and vetted.
[02:23:58.599 --> 02:23:59.801]  I don't care what you think about me.
[02:23:59.821 --> 02:24:00.601]  Let's get that straight.
[02:24:01.102 --> 02:24:03.764]  Okay, and I'm just here putting information out.
[02:24:05.686 --> 02:24:11.171]  Obviously, I don't agree with World Can't Wait and Ed Asner on gun control and issues like that and abortion.
[02:24:11.804 --> 02:24:15.827]  I'm saying Bill O'Reilly lied on the show and was deceptive about the war.
[02:24:15.907 --> 02:24:18.930]  We were debating the war, and I talked about that.
[02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:22.953]  But see, a lot of people still support O'Reilly because he'll bash on some liberal groups.
[02:24:23.694 --> 02:24:30.319]  You know, I just had the New York 9-11 Truth guys on who were kind of ostracized by the liberal 9-11 Truth because they wanted to go after Brzezinski.
[02:24:30.559 --> 02:24:31.900]  They wanted to go after Rockefeller.
[02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:33.501]  They wanted to go after globalization.
[02:24:34.122 --> 02:24:35.763]  They wanted to go after George Soros.
[02:24:36.584 --> 02:24:38.285]  We are going after all those people.
[02:24:38.546 --> 02:24:40.247]  We're shattering the left-right paradigm.
[02:24:40.862 --> 02:25:00.997]  But because we sit here and show how O'Reilly is deceptive about the war when we're debating in a compartmentalized fashion the war with that issue, to say that I had somebody on from World Can't Wait who's protesting against the war and to decipher O'Reilly's lies is just pointless.
[02:25:01.337 --> 02:25:03.279]  Let's stop taking all our time up
[02:25:04.725 --> 02:25:10.568]  Worrying if somebody fighting the New World Order, you know, is exactly to our liking.
[02:25:10.889 --> 02:25:13.910]  Instead of worrying about them, why don't you go out and protest?
[02:25:14.270 --> 02:25:15.371]  You go out and demonstrate.
[02:25:15.411 --> 02:25:16.572]  You go start a website.
[02:25:17.632 --> 02:25:19.373]  And go out there and lead us.
[02:25:19.593 --> 02:25:21.455]  I mean, believe me, sir, I'm here to work with you.
[02:25:22.655 --> 02:25:27.178]  You know, I mean, all the time, 9-11 truthers in different parts of the country, well, Alex doesn't come to our meetings.
[02:25:27.218 --> 02:25:28.619]  Well, Alex doesn't come to our rallies.
[02:25:28.659 --> 02:25:30.279]  Well, Alex wouldn't come to our events.
[02:25:30.420 --> 02:25:32.461]  Because I don't have the time, you jokers!
[02:25:33.334 --> 02:25:34.715]  Alex didn't respond to my email!
[02:25:34.775 --> 02:25:35.735]  My feelings are hurt!
[02:25:36.315 --> 02:25:46.899]  You know, I literally race to comb my hair, race to brush my teeth, try to take a few hours out of the day that's treasured with my family, and the rest of it, I just beat my head up against a wall working!
[02:25:47.439 --> 02:25:52.141]  And so frankly, it's not that I don't mind being criticized, but it's those type of criticisms.
[02:25:52.901 --> 02:25:57.043]  I mean, I love being criticized by, you know, popular mechanics and the CIA.
[02:25:58.573 --> 02:26:02.334]  I love being criticized by the New World Order, because that means I'm hurting them.
[02:26:02.374 --> 02:26:08.115]  But it's people like you who I know mean well, who criticize me when you don't know who I am.
[02:26:09.915 --> 02:26:12.556]  And it just, but it isn't about me.
[02:26:13.156 --> 02:26:14.816]  Tom in Ohio, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:26:14.836 --> 02:26:22.397]  And when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him.
[02:26:23.717 --> 02:26:25.058]  Yeah, that's a good verse.
[02:26:25.098 --> 02:26:25.898]  Where is that in the Bible?
[02:26:27.541 --> 02:26:29.102]  I haven't talked to you in years, Alex.
[02:26:29.122 --> 02:26:31.143]  You used to have that on your web page.
[02:26:33.164 --> 02:26:35.164]  Well, I think we do somewhere, but what's on your mind, sir?
[02:26:35.184 --> 02:26:36.085]  Your phone's a little low.
[02:26:37.125 --> 02:26:40.086]  I wanted to know how to get a copy of that New Orleans.
[02:26:40.267 --> 02:26:43.548]  Those two kids went through that mess down there and filmed a lot of it.
[02:26:45.689 --> 02:26:49.110]  I don't remember their names or the name of the film.
[02:26:49.130 --> 02:26:52.892]  I'll try to look it up during the break.
[02:26:54.233 --> 02:26:54.433]  But...
[02:26:56.914 --> 02:27:10.059]  Well they were on a few months ago and they were on about a year ago before that and it's oh man I just again I can't remember but do you remember their first names?
[02:27:10.859 --> 02:27:12.300]  No I don't I don't.
[02:27:13.580 --> 02:27:15.801]  Now that was some really powerful footage they got in there.
[02:27:16.682 --> 02:27:25.085]  I know we had them on twice and promoted their DVD you know sold a bunch for them but I don't got it out there to people but then I just don't remember I try to help everybody and move forward.
[02:27:33.084 --> 02:27:34.004]  We're on the march.
[02:27:34.465 --> 02:27:36.085]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:36.105 --> 02:27:39.767]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:40.122 --> 02:28:45.125]  This is Elizabeth Border.
[02:28:45.685 --> 02:28:46.326]  News Alert!

[02:28:53.350 --> 02:28:56.332]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[02:28:56.352 --> 02:28:57.813]  War in Iran?
[02:28:57.833 --> 02:28:59.995]  A coming One World Church?
[02:29:00.755 --> 02:29:06.059]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[02:29:42.657 --> 02:29:47.159]  Summer is once again just around the corner, and as usual, so are higher gas prices.
[02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:50.761]  This year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back!
[02:29:51.242 --> 02:29:59.306]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[02:30:00.246 --> 02:30:05.369]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised, Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem.
[02:30:05.869 --> 02:30:06.810]  Unburned fuel.
[02:30:07.251 --> 02:30:10.995]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[02:30:11.456 --> 02:30:16.302]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[02:30:16.702 --> 02:30:23.270]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:25.511]  And it's so easy to use.

[02:31:13.038 --> 02:31:16.179]  Private Gruckheimer in Ithaca, New York came back to town.
[02:31:16.219 --> 02:31:20.421]  He said, yeah, we go into whole villages and kill everyone, men, women, and children.
[02:31:20.461 --> 02:31:21.221]  It's really great.
[02:31:21.741 --> 02:31:23.582]  It was in the Ithaca Journal, a big newspaper.
[02:31:24.322 --> 02:31:26.343]  And then Fox News and the Pentagon clarified.
[02:31:26.363 --> 02:31:30.384]  And they said, well, yes, in certain areas we do kill everyone because there may be hostiles.
[02:31:30.424 --> 02:31:31.625]  That was their clarification.
[02:31:32.705 --> 02:31:36.767]  Kind of like when Pat Robertson said, well, China's doing what it has to do with forced abortion.
[02:31:37.547 --> 02:31:38.607]  And he clarified.
[02:31:38.627 --> 02:31:40.628]  He said, well, yeah, they are overpopulated.
[02:31:41.371 --> 02:31:41.751]  I mean, okay!
[02:31:41.791 --> 02:31:45.454]  It's just absolutely incredible how sick conservatives are in this country.
[02:31:45.474 --> 02:31:48.655]  Oh, by the way, we keep getting phone calls and craziness and wildness.
[02:32:01.855 --> 02:32:03.677]  Eight o'clock tonight, Ron Paul's office.
[02:32:03.737 --> 02:32:04.939]  Ron Paul is in the debate.
[02:32:04.999 --> 02:32:06.440]  Ron Paul is going to be on the debate.
[02:32:06.921 --> 02:32:12.567]  Now, it happened to Keyes and a few others in years past, where they show up and then they say, you are barred.
[02:32:12.928 --> 02:32:16.431]  And then the police will put you in a car and drive you around and throw you out in the middle of nowhere.
[02:32:16.752 --> 02:32:17.553]  That's happened twice.
[02:32:18.454 --> 02:32:21.816]  Uh, in debates, but, uh, we'll see if that happens to the Congressman.
[02:32:21.836 --> 02:32:22.256]  But no!
[02:32:22.696 --> 02:32:33.881]  He's scheduled, he's there, it's a rumor, he's on the list, he's on the MSNBC list, and he's been scheduled for months, and it's gonna... I think each person will have, like, two words to say.
[02:32:33.901 --> 02:32:34.941]  There's gonna be so many of them.
[02:32:35.401 --> 02:32:39.383]  But, uh, I mean, he is a serious presidential candidate, and that's coming up tonight.
[02:32:39.403 --> 02:32:44.225]  We'll certainly tape it, and then play his comments for you tomorrow here on air.
[02:32:46.107 --> 02:32:52.071]  But getting back to war, that's our Republican presidential debate at 8 o'clock Eastern tonight.
[02:32:53.072 --> 02:32:55.814]  Details are up on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:32:56.795 --> 02:33:00.437]  But getting back to the war, here's Paul Harvey.
[02:33:00.497 --> 02:33:07.362]  Now a few years ago he said, just nuke them, kill them all, we didn't used to be made out of sugar candy and we just need to kill all the Muslims.
[02:33:08.803 --> 02:33:12.165]  Well that's what Hitler said, I mean let's just kill all this group, kill all that group.
[02:33:12.285 --> 02:33:12.986]  Once you do that,
[02:33:13.627 --> 02:33:19.270]  By the way, and then again, as Americans, people think, like at some tribal level, we're wiping out some neighboring tribe.
[02:33:19.891 --> 02:33:20.911]  That's not what's happening.
[02:33:20.951 --> 02:33:24.453]  The people are using us to wipe out others, while we're being wiped out.
[02:33:24.674 --> 02:33:25.994]  Do you comprehend that?
[02:33:26.835 --> 02:33:29.376]  Now, it did turn out that that wasn't the original Paul Harvey.
[02:33:29.396 --> 02:33:31.278]  The original Paul Harvey barely does the show.
[02:33:31.578 --> 02:33:32.858]  They're very secretive about it.
[02:33:33.139 --> 02:33:35.460]  His son imitates his voice exactly.
[02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:38.622]  And then again, his name is Paul Harvey, too.
[02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:40.790]  Totally freakish.
[02:33:40.870 --> 02:33:42.071]  It's all fake, folks.
[02:33:42.811 --> 02:33:47.652]  And, uh, but here he is, uh, twisting it, saying, you know, they're, they're all enemies.
[02:33:47.712 --> 02:33:48.992]  Civilians are all enemies.
[02:33:49.052 --> 02:33:49.992]  Just kill them all.
[02:33:50.253 --> 02:33:50.733]  Here it is.
[02:33:51.573 --> 02:33:52.833]  And hear this, please.
[02:33:55.074 --> 02:34:05.996]  In Western Afghanistan, where NATO forces are involved in some of the deadliest fighting since January, among the 136 dead this morning, suspect Taliban.
[02:34:07.737 --> 02:34:08.577]  But there are others.
[02:34:09.901 --> 02:34:11.882]  51 villagers, mostly women and children.
[02:34:13.162 --> 02:34:20.424]  Might not the news media put a stop to such pulled punches wars as this?
[02:34:21.884 --> 02:34:35.787]  If we would just desist from categorizing civilians, it was civilians for goodness sake who decapitated New York City since the invention of the aerial bomb five wars ago.
[02:34:37.248 --> 02:34:38.028]  There have been no
[02:34:39.033 --> 02:34:39.693]  Civilians.
[02:34:43.114 --> 02:34:50.877]  Now, of course, that's circular logic, because they would say that Al-Qaeda's evil, if you believe the official fairytale, attacked civilians.
[02:34:51.057 --> 02:34:53.197]  But there are no civilians, sir.
[02:34:53.838 --> 02:34:56.919]  So that wasn't an attack, the decapitation of New York.
[02:34:56.959 --> 02:34:59.359]  Yeah, New York was just wiped off the map completely.
[02:34:59.719 --> 02:35:01.180]  No, the government blew up three buildings.
[02:35:02.266 --> 02:35:04.068]  Uh, after flying airplanes into them.
[02:35:04.088 --> 02:35:06.029]  Then they go, what, you say airplanes didn't fly in?
[02:35:06.069 --> 02:35:08.111]  No, they flew those in for the theatrical effect.
[02:35:08.431 --> 02:35:21.501]  Then the second act was the towers blowing up, and the third, of course, the Pentagon, and then an added little bonus encore, uh, with, uh, the, uh, the Bravo there, uh, with, uh, Building 7, of course.
[02:35:23.083 --> 02:35:27.326]  And then kind of like a little after-theater goodie of the anthrax attack,
[02:35:28.792 --> 02:35:31.353]  So, they're evil, let's just kill the men, women, and children.
[02:35:31.373 --> 02:35:33.694]  Well, that's what Gruckheimer said, and they said, yeah.
[02:35:33.714 --> 02:35:37.456]  They go into villages, and they walk right up to five-year-olds, and they blow their heads off.
[02:35:39.677 --> 02:35:51.063]  And that's what they do, and Tom Brokaw, one of his last newscasts, when they were going into Fallujah, after they kicked everybody out of the city, they said, you take an ID card with a biometric, and if you're found without it, you're shot on sight.
[02:35:51.770 --> 02:35:52.450]  That's the freedom!
[02:35:53.170 --> 02:36:00.852]  You're caught without your ID, they walk you up against a wall and spray you with machine gun bullets, and you fall down on the ground dead, and they just walk off laughing and gang member talk.
[02:36:00.872 --> 02:36:03.173]  I mean, that's what our military is.
[02:36:03.193 --> 02:36:05.273]  It's illegal aliens and gang members predominantly.
[02:36:05.914 --> 02:36:08.314]  They're all gonna be scum police reeling over us here soon.
[02:36:09.074 --> 02:36:11.455]  You think they work for America?
[02:36:11.915 --> 02:36:13.796]  I mean, you know, you got another thing coming.
[02:36:14.056 --> 02:36:17.677]  And any troops that have got souls wake up and come back and agree with us.
[02:36:18.317 --> 02:36:18.697]  That's 70% of them.
[02:36:20.194 --> 02:36:25.237]  But more and more they're getting rid of the good troops and it's all going to be gang member and illegal alien and an aggravated felon.
[02:36:27.318 --> 02:36:34.622]  You mean to play the clips of them just for fun sitting off the side of a highway just shooting cars full of families laughing and making jokes about it?
[02:36:36.943 --> 02:36:40.265]  I mean it comes out in the news all the time where some sergeant will go, I want to go kill some people.
[02:36:40.285 --> 02:36:45.528]  And they go, alright, they'll drink some tequila and go stumbling out of the green zone, just walk up, rape, kill, do whatever they want.
[02:36:47.302 --> 02:36:49.003]  Then you rape and kill somebody's sister.
[02:36:49.164 --> 02:36:50.525]  They let her go kill a G.I.
[02:36:51.706 --> 02:36:53.647]  And then it's on the news that a terrorist killed a G.I.
[02:36:53.847 --> 02:36:54.768]  It wasn't a terrorist.
[02:36:55.188 --> 02:36:56.129]  You raped his sister.
[02:36:57.450 --> 02:36:58.751]  What do you think he's going to do to you?
[02:37:00.672 --> 02:37:01.793]  You don't like being occupied?
[02:37:01.833 --> 02:37:02.814]  You're called a terrorist.
[02:37:05.376 --> 02:37:06.657]  We're the bad guys, folks.
[02:37:07.338 --> 02:37:08.599]  Have you figured that out yet here?
[02:37:09.519 --> 02:37:14.143]  And I don't like it being appropriated to my family name and to my children's name and to me.
[02:37:15.097 --> 02:37:17.159]  I'm not involved in this dirtbag behavior.
[02:37:17.979 --> 02:37:19.321]  You want to put troops on the borders.
[02:37:19.581 --> 02:37:20.602]  You want people to enlist.
[02:37:20.622 --> 02:37:24.865]  We got Mexican troops shooting at us, kidnapping US citizens, taking over the Southwest.
[02:37:25.446 --> 02:37:27.027]  If Mexico wants a war, let's give them one.
[02:37:27.047 --> 02:37:28.248]  That's what a real war is about.
[02:37:28.448 --> 02:37:29.269]  It's for your country.
[02:37:29.489 --> 02:37:31.811]  It's on your borders against somebody that attacks you.
[02:37:32.311 --> 02:37:33.993]  What do you think 9-11 is?
[02:37:34.253 --> 02:37:36.555]  You still haven't got it through your head yet, have you?
[02:37:37.515 --> 02:37:39.397]  It's a self-inflicted Reichstag event.
[02:37:41.428 --> 02:37:41.928]  I'm going to get him on.
[02:38:03.659 --> 02:38:06.081]  Also told the BBC's Newsnight program that the U.S.
[02:38:06.141 --> 02:38:06.782]  and U.K.
[02:38:06.822 --> 02:38:10.364]  must admit defeat and stop fighting a hopeless war in Iraq.
[02:38:10.965 --> 02:38:13.467]  They're not defeated, General, and I'm sure you know that.
[02:38:14.307 --> 02:38:16.069]  There's been no... This is a great victory!
[02:38:16.549 --> 02:38:26.697]  The actual strategic goal to turn the country into a third world cesspool, reduce the population, and build permanent bases to project power into the region has been carried off with extreme precision.
[02:38:27.822 --> 02:38:29.684]  Millions of dead Iraqis was the plan?
[02:38:29.704 --> 02:38:31.827]  Do you think they care about 3,000 dead U.S.
[02:38:31.847 --> 02:38:32.648]  troops they admit to?
[02:38:32.968 --> 02:38:33.308]  Well over 12,000?
[02:38:33.849 --> 02:38:34.209]  No!
[02:38:34.970 --> 02:38:37.113]  So start admitting that it's a success.
[02:38:37.513 --> 02:38:40.016]  It's just a very disgusting, evil success, okay?
[02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:46.664]  See, everything's about turning your perspective to the enemy's view, and then it all becomes clear.
[02:38:46.704 --> 02:38:48.105]  You're looking at it from down low, folks.
[02:38:48.145 --> 02:38:50.007]  You get up on top of the mountain of doom and look down.
[02:38:50.287 --> 02:38:54.490]  You can see exactly what the enemy's doing in a Machiavellian, very cold-blooded fashion.
[02:38:55.111 --> 02:38:57.152]  I mean, you don't just see what they're doing.
[02:38:57.193 --> 02:38:58.494]  You can see it and know what they're doing.
[02:38:58.974 --> 02:39:00.155]  I don't even need to read their documents.
[02:39:00.175 --> 02:39:04.819]  Before I read a CFR document, I already know what's in it and exactly what I knew was in there, because they never change.
[02:39:04.859 --> 02:39:05.799]  It's all habitual.
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:07.061]  But I never trust it.
[02:39:07.201 --> 02:39:08.622]  Every once in a while, they throw a curveball.
[02:39:09.622 --> 02:39:10.723]  I never trust that I know.
[02:39:10.743 --> 02:39:16.586]  I know their general vector attack pattern, and then I can go check into it, and it generally is sometimes with a curveball.
[02:39:17.946 --> 02:39:20.748]  Iraq insurgents would not give in, he said.
[02:39:20.768 --> 02:39:22.088]  That's even better.
[02:39:22.128 --> 02:39:22.949]  It goes on forever.
[02:39:23.069 --> 02:39:23.729]  What do you mean?
[02:39:24.389 --> 02:39:26.130]  Iraq insurgents would not give in, he said.
[02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:30.312]  I don't excuse them for some of the terrible things they do, but I do understand why they are resisting.
[02:39:30.853 --> 02:39:33.794]  The total number of UK troops killed in operations in Iraq stands at 147.
[02:39:33.834 --> 02:39:34.114]  Admit defeat.
[02:39:37.159 --> 02:39:43.583]  Sir Michael has written a book drawing similarities between the tactics of the insurgents and George Washington's men in America's War of Independence.
[02:39:43.943 --> 02:39:45.464]  And I will say this for the British commanders.
[02:39:45.684 --> 02:39:48.946]  They've been running an empire longer, and they know when they're getting their butt kicked.
[02:39:49.827 --> 02:39:57.331]  And the British, some of the British oligarchs know they gotta pull out now just to have any play in the country's future, and any play in the goodies.
[02:39:59.212 --> 02:40:04.435]  But, uh, you think some little spoiled frat boy cokehead is gonna listen?
[02:40:04.636 --> 02:40:05.136]  Ha ha!
[02:40:06.157 --> 02:40:06.777]  Are you kidding?
[02:40:09.131 --> 02:40:09.511]  Okay.
[02:40:10.892 --> 02:40:15.054]  A guy who's obsessed with poo-poo and constantly talks about it 24 hours a day?
[02:40:18.656 --> 02:40:20.717]  Oh yeah, even his mainline biographers admit that.
[02:40:21.678 --> 02:40:24.679]  Of course, he doesn't run anything, but that just gives you a mindset into these people.
[02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:31.643]  I would say his degeneracy is, his degenerate behavior is nothing compared to many of those around him.
[02:40:33.254 --> 02:40:37.517]  Gasoline prices could hit record this month, says AAA.
[02:40:38.798 --> 02:40:43.260]  The neocons say, we went over there to stop Saddam because he was going to attack us with Al-Qaeda.
[02:40:44.181 --> 02:40:48.323]  And then Saddam's out, so now Al-Qaeda's come in, so we have to stay there because Al-Qaeda's there.
[02:40:48.804 --> 02:40:51.986]  And then they say Iran is Al-Qaeda again when they're our enemies.
[02:40:53.747 --> 02:40:57.949]  Even if you believe Al-Qaeda's real, according to the official story.
[02:40:59.030 --> 02:41:01.612]  And they're saying gas could go well over $3 a gallon
[02:41:03.061 --> 02:41:04.222]  Previous succeeded $3 per gallon.
[02:41:04.242 --> 02:41:09.124]  They're saying, AAA is saying it may break the record of over $3 a gallon nationally on average.
[02:41:09.404 --> 02:41:14.347]  That could mean as high as $4.50 in some areas of California, New York.
[02:41:15.888 --> 02:41:16.448]  Unbelievable.
[02:41:16.708 --> 02:41:19.169]  And there's a couple reasons for this.
[02:41:19.289 --> 02:41:21.530]  Artificial scarcity by locking down Iraqi oil.
[02:41:21.590 --> 02:41:22.071]  It goes up.
[02:41:22.351 --> 02:41:23.832]  Oil companies post record profits.
[02:41:23.992 --> 02:41:25.733]  Neocons are always there to tell you that's not the case.
[02:41:26.053 --> 02:41:26.373]  Lying.
[02:41:27.695 --> 02:41:34.681]  And their own oil company memos say that, the Republic Associated Press, directly from them saying it, that they're staging all this.
[02:41:35.161 --> 02:41:38.484]  And then, of course, the dollar has been devalued, so it's going to cost more to there.
[02:41:39.545 --> 02:41:44.269]  Heard a John Stossel report a couple years ago where he talked about that, and he was actually telling you the truth.
[02:41:44.810 --> 02:41:46.191]  He just called it inflation, though.
[02:41:46.211 --> 02:41:49.214]  He didn't tell you it was the dollar being tanked by design.
[02:41:50.698 --> 02:41:55.501]  Of course, if we politically blame the government for doing this, they would not allow it and would probably reverse it.
[02:41:55.621 --> 02:41:57.181]  But they're doing trawl balloons.
[02:41:57.361 --> 02:42:02.044]  The public is not aware of what currency even means, on average, and they're not concerned.
[02:42:02.104 --> 02:42:05.906]  Those that do read the business pages have been told it's good for manufacturing, which it hasn't helped at all.
[02:42:06.246 --> 02:42:10.428]  Growth rate now at 1.6, and that's actually a negative with inflation, at over 10% right now.
[02:42:10.728 --> 02:42:15.431]  I know the mainline inflation is at 4-something percent, but that's a false number and the index is cross-referenced.
[02:42:15.851 --> 02:42:20.093]  But, um... The point is, we're in a lot of trouble.
[02:42:21.039 --> 02:42:29.806]  And if you would recognize who the enemy was, we could end the war, control the borders, get the Second Amendment back, get sovereignty back, and start having tariffs again.
[02:42:30.087 --> 02:42:38.914]  But see, you watch, right before the big sign they're going to plunge the economy, is they're going to erect some tariffs that are never enforced, and then claim that's the crash of the economy.
[02:42:38.934 --> 02:42:39.635]  They always do that.
[02:42:40.095 --> 02:42:40.916]  You just watch them do it.
[02:42:40.936 --> 02:42:46.821]  Or they may precipitate it two days after a terror attack and blame it on Al, Easter Bunny, CIA.
[02:42:48.815 --> 02:42:50.977]  So House fails to overturn a war spending veto.
[02:42:50.997 --> 02:42:51.617]  Of course they did.
[02:42:51.657 --> 02:42:52.698]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[02:42:53.239 --> 02:43:00.104]  Even their so-called pullout was thaved in and by the time it happened we'd have Hillary in and then she could accelerate the war.
[02:43:04.427 --> 02:43:06.929]  But I already talked about Paul Harvey and the bloodthirstiness.
[02:43:08.330 --> 02:43:08.611]  U.S.
[02:43:08.651 --> 02:43:12.574]  may be keeping tactical nukes at, I have trouble pronouncing this,
[02:43:14.984 --> 02:43:16.965]  K-Y-R-G-Y-Z.
[02:43:17.205 --> 02:43:19.987]  Earlier today I could pronounce it, now I'm looking at it under pressure and I can't.
[02:43:20.887 --> 02:43:21.747]  Kirogz.
[02:43:22.588 --> 02:43:23.328]  Kirogz.
[02:43:24.329 --> 02:43:28.010]  Airbase to attack, says their expert.
[02:43:28.070 --> 02:43:29.631]  This is Interfax Russian News.
[02:43:29.651 --> 02:43:30.031]  The U.S.
[02:43:30.091 --> 02:43:36.975]  might be keeping low-yield nuclear weapons at its airbase in Kairagistan's Manas.
[02:43:38.032 --> 02:43:39.373]  There's about 50 of those stands.
[02:43:39.674 --> 02:43:46.541]  For possible use against Iran's nuclear facilities, the CAIRES special service report to learn facts on condition and anonymity.
[02:43:46.902 --> 02:43:53.909]  No one can rule out the possibility that such nuclear weapons may be there because the custom services do not control cargo delivered to the airbase.
[02:43:54.470 --> 02:44:00.076]  If nuclear arms were delivered to MANAS, among other cargo, the custom services would not know anything about it.
[02:44:03.023 --> 02:44:05.385]  Let's go ahead and read this little story out of AP.
[02:44:05.426 --> 02:44:08.929]  We're going to be having some of these guests on the show the next week.
[02:44:08.969 --> 02:44:09.749]  We're working on that.
[02:44:10.190 --> 02:44:13.532]  This just came out today, Thursday, May 3rd.
[02:44:14.353 --> 02:44:16.555]  Honeybee die-off threatens food supply.
[02:44:16.575 --> 02:44:18.737]  They're finally getting around to reporting on this.
[02:44:19.538 --> 02:44:23.301]  Wonder if they'll have some global tax to save them instead of just stopping the BT corn.
[02:44:24.453 --> 02:44:33.636]  Well, you know, the corn grows the pesticide in it that kills the bugs, and the bees don't know it and eat it and die, but we feed it to humans because the EPA says it's safe, and so are cell phones, and so is mercury.
[02:44:34.196 --> 02:44:35.597]  In fact, people don't believe me.
[02:44:35.637 --> 02:44:37.037]  Dig Up Mercury is good for you.
[02:44:37.497 --> 02:44:38.418]  This aired nationally.
[02:44:38.458 --> 02:44:39.638]  This was the local version of it.
[02:44:39.998 --> 02:44:41.999]  I play this every month because you don't believe me when I say it.
[02:44:42.299 --> 02:44:48.341]  A few times I've said that the news has announced that mercury is good for your brain, and I get emails saying, I'm a liar, so just cue it up, please.
[02:44:49.598 --> 02:44:52.379]  Go ahead, and this is local CBS, but this was aired nationally.
[02:44:52.419 --> 02:44:54.380]  Again, they produce them canned at the federal level.
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:57.761]  They're sent down from the CBS Broadcast Center to the three major networks.
[02:44:58.041 --> 02:44:59.281]  CBS actually runs everything.
[02:45:00.302 --> 02:45:03.003]  And then, well, let's go back to it.
[02:45:03.223 --> 02:45:03.583]  Here it is.
[02:45:04.003 --> 02:45:06.424]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[02:45:06.664 --> 02:45:09.705]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[02:45:10.618 --> 02:45:12.682]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[02:45:12.762 --> 02:45:15.426]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[02:45:15.446 --> 02:45:18.731]  This tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporters from the map.
[02:45:21.503 --> 02:45:27.485]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:45:27.945 --> 02:45:34.388]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[02:45:34.848 --> 02:45:41.810]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:47.272]  And one study was put out by a big pharma company, the other federally funded at a university.
[02:45:48.374 --> 02:45:55.466]  And they had narrowly defined guidelines of people that had been inoculated with mercury vaccines claiming they were just better students and sat better.
[02:45:56.913 --> 02:45:58.414]  That's actually why they do give it to you.
[02:45:58.454 --> 02:46:01.495]  So in a weird, sick way, they're telling you, hey, you're brain damaged.
[02:46:01.836 --> 02:46:02.556]  Just a little bit.
[02:46:02.576 --> 02:46:08.979]  Don't worry, you won't ever have those great struggles with higher level thinking and complex philosophy and reasoning.
[02:46:09.359 --> 02:46:16.322]  You'll never have those incredible, you know, two hour long, you know, sitting on the front porch complex thoughts.
[02:46:16.442 --> 02:46:17.863]  It's just going to be easy for you now.
[02:46:17.883 --> 02:46:21.404]  Oh, yes.
[02:46:21.824 --> 02:46:23.265]  Honeybees die off.
[02:46:23.845 --> 02:46:25.206]  Threatens food supply.
[02:46:26.864 --> 02:46:28.705]  Again, this is nutritious for you.
[02:46:29.446 --> 02:46:41.152]  Unless someone or something stops it soon, the mysterious killer that is wiping out many of the nation's honeybees could have a devastating effect on America's dinner plate, perhaps even reducing us to a glorified bread and water diet.
[02:46:41.492 --> 02:46:52.999]  Honeybees don't just make honey, they pollinate more than 90 of the tastiest flowering crops we have, among them apples, nuts, avocados, soybeans, asparagus, broccoli, celery, squash, cucumbers,
[02:46:53.985 --> 02:47:05.450]  Again, corn, it goes on and on, and lots of really sweet and tart stuff, too, including citrus, fruits, peaches, kiwis, cherries, blueberries, cranberries, strawberries, cantaloupe, and other melons.
[02:47:06.050 --> 02:47:06.851]  And it goes on.
[02:47:07.271 --> 02:47:17.335]  In fact, about one-third of the human diet comes from the insect-pollinated plants, and the honeybee is responsible for 80% of the pollinization, according to the U.S.
[02:47:17.375 --> 02:47:18.736]  Department of Agriculture.
[02:47:19.860 --> 02:47:22.822]  Even cattle, which feed on alfalfa, depend on bees.
[02:47:23.142 --> 02:47:32.368]  So if the collapse worsens, we could end up being stuck with grains and water, said Kevin Hackett, the National Program Leader at the USDA's Bee and Pollen Program.
[02:47:32.628 --> 02:47:35.430]  This is the biggest general threat to our food supply, Hackett said.
[02:47:35.450 --> 02:47:37.732]  And it goes on.
[02:47:37.752 --> 02:47:40.273]  This is the biggest bee collapse ever recorded.
[02:47:40.713 --> 02:47:43.655]  And that's not just in domesticated bees.
[02:47:44.776 --> 02:47:45.957]  It's in the wild bees,
[02:47:47.085 --> 02:47:48.886]  Thank you for your time.
[02:48:06.332 --> 02:48:06.732]  Okay?
[02:48:07.673 --> 02:48:08.914]  With the studies we've got.
[02:48:09.254 --> 02:48:10.014]  And it makes sense.
[02:48:10.114 --> 02:48:13.056]  It's a pesticide growing corn.
[02:48:13.156 --> 02:48:14.577]  When bugs eat it, they die.
[02:48:14.617 --> 02:48:17.639]  But bees, for some reason, aren't aware of it.
[02:48:18.299 --> 02:48:19.440]  They eat it and they die.
[02:48:19.700 --> 02:48:20.201]  Wow!
[02:48:20.261 --> 02:48:22.902]  That's really hard to figure out.
[02:48:23.543 --> 02:48:24.323]  Are they going to stop?
[02:48:24.824 --> 02:48:25.724]  Absolutely not.
[02:48:27.365 --> 02:48:28.186]  Absolutely not.
[02:48:28.226 --> 02:48:29.046]  They're not going to stop.
[02:48:29.066 --> 02:48:32.848]  They're even trying to pass laws restricting free speech against criticizing GMO.
[02:48:33.149 --> 02:48:33.909]  You think I'm joking?
[02:48:33.949 --> 02:48:35.170]  I have news articles in front of me.
[02:48:35.791 --> 02:48:38.914]  We'll come back to give you the big JFK news and wrap it up.
[02:48:38.934 --> 02:48:40.135]  Sorry, no more time for calls.
[02:48:43.198 --> 02:48:46.141]  It's here.
[02:48:46.321 --> 02:48:51.106]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:51.486 --> 02:48:59.033]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:59.818 --> 02:49:06.881]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:07.261 --> 02:49:18.686]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:19.006 --> 02:49:22.508]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:22.948 --> 02:49:24.889]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:25.229 --> 02:49:29.071]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:55.527 --> 02:49:59.009]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria
[02:49:59.289 --> 02:50:03.491]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:03.771 --> 02:50:07.713]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:50:07.933 --> 02:50:14.457]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:50:14.677 --> 02:50:20.180]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:20.420 --> 02:50:25.002]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system.
[02:50:25.242 --> 02:50:27.324]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[02:50:42.327 --> 02:50:44.027]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:44.247 --> 02:50:47.968]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:48.288 --> 02:50:57.210]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:50:57.370 --> 02:51:04.292]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked every time you walk away from your computer.
[02:51:04.512 --> 02:51:05.153]  We're good to go.
[02:51:21.252 --> 02:51:24.373]  There's no software to load, and it's so easy to install.

[02:52:02.492 --> 02:52:09.356]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:09.376 --> 02:52:19.661]  Final segment, retransmitted on stations all over the nation from 9 to midnight tonight.
[02:52:26.781 --> 02:52:29.142]  Free podcast daily at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:29.543 --> 02:52:32.264]  Show restreamed 24 hours a day at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:35.306 --> 02:52:39.388]  RFK immediately thought Brother's assassination was a conspiracy.
[02:52:39.408 --> 02:52:55.798]  David Talbott, Salon Magazine and Online Journal, the very main line, and of course we'd already heard this and knew this from the family and other JFK researchers, that they knew it was a killing, but he couldn't go public and say that because the public was completely gullible back then.
[02:52:57.526 --> 02:53:00.247]  And of course they gunned him down at the Ambassador Hotel a few years later.
[02:53:00.687 --> 02:53:09.911]  One of the most intriguing mysteries about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the darkest of American labyrinths, is why his brother, Robert F. Kennedy, apparently did nothing to investigate the crime.
[02:53:10.551 --> 02:53:21.336]  Bobby Kennedy was, after all, not just the Attorney General of the United States at the time of the assassination, but was his brother's devoted partner, the man who took on the administration's most grueling assignments.
[02:53:22.344 --> 02:53:39.753]  And it goes on, but after the burst of gunfire in downtown Dallas on November 22nd, 1963 ended the unique partnership, Bobby seemed lost in a fog of grief, refusing to discuss the assassination with the Warren Commission and telling friends he had no heart for an aggressive investigation.
[02:53:39.813 --> 02:53:40.694]  What difference does it make?
[02:53:40.734 --> 02:53:42.655]  He would say it won't bring him back.
[02:53:44.179 --> 02:53:53.422]  It's a long report, but these articles make you read the whole thing, but it just goes into it with him telling friends, family, and others that he knew the government had killed him.
[02:53:54.702 --> 02:54:01.564]  But Bobby Kennedy was a complex man in his years in Washington who taught him to keep his own counsel and proceed in a subterranean fashion.
[02:54:02.104 --> 02:54:04.685]  What he said in the public about Dallas was not the full story.
[02:54:04.985 --> 02:54:11.267]  Privately, RFK, who had made his name in the 1950s as a relentless investigator of the underside of American power,
[02:54:12.131 --> 02:54:12.672]  We're good to go.
[02:54:31.608 --> 02:54:37.130]  Who killed his brother continued to haunt Kennedy until the day he was gunned down in June 5th, 1968.
[02:54:38.551 --> 02:54:41.652]  And then it goes on with him saying he believed it was a conspiracy.
[02:54:42.192 --> 02:54:43.352]  And the quotes are all in there.
[02:54:43.372 --> 02:54:44.153]  It's a long article.
[02:54:44.173 --> 02:54:45.613]  We're going to write one about this article.
[02:54:45.993 --> 02:54:48.274]  And then mesh it with the big breaking news.
[02:54:50.815 --> 02:54:51.015]  St.
[02:54:51.075 --> 02:54:54.377]  John Hunt went more public here with more details than he has anywhere else.
[02:54:55.817 --> 02:54:57.118]  Imagine what's happened here!
[02:54:57.158 --> 02:54:58.038]  Hidden in plain view.
[02:54:58.058 --> 02:54:59.879]  We're not even appreciating the magnitude of this.
[02:54:59.939 --> 02:55:00.699]  I don't think I am.
[02:55:01.574 --> 02:55:09.159]  A tape of E. Howard Hunt, who we already knew was the commander, and we already knew was at the meeting at Clinton Murchison's house in Dallas.
[02:55:10.779 --> 02:55:12.621]  That needs to be added, by the way, to this article.
[02:55:13.601 --> 02:55:16.783]  Now a tape of him saying, yeah, they ran the black op, Mikhail Kennedy.
[02:55:16.943 --> 02:55:17.583]  There you are!
[02:55:17.743 --> 02:55:24.387]  One of the people photographed there, the guy that ran overthrows of presidents and prime ministers worldwide, the Bay of Pigs.
[02:55:24.968 --> 02:55:27.189]  We already fingered E. Howard Hunt for 40 years.
[02:55:27.649 --> 02:55:28.810]  E. Howard Hunt admits it.
[02:55:28.830 --> 02:55:30.531]  Do you realize the magnitude?
[02:55:31.983 --> 02:55:33.724]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.

[02:55:37.185 --> 02:55:38.806]  Son of JFK Conspiracy.
[02:55:39.366 --> 02:55:41.567]  A conspirator drops new bombshell revelations.
[02:55:42.107 --> 02:55:46.289]  Costner was set to make documentary on Hunt's confession before Miami Mafia stepped in.
[02:55:46.709 --> 02:55:50.711]  E. Howard believed government had sabotaged his wife's plane.
[02:55:51.111 --> 02:55:52.491]  And it goes into more details.
[02:55:52.972 --> 02:55:53.312]  Get it.
[02:55:53.352 --> 02:55:54.372]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:55:54.612 --> 02:55:56.213]  It's part two of our investigation.
