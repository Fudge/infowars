[00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:09.880]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.340]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.001]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:17.482]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.843 --> 00:00:21.944]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.518 --> 00:00:33.720]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.461]  Welcome.
[00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:37.104]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:37.124 --> 00:00:39.026]  It is the 29th day of August 2007 as we race towards
[00:00:51.895 --> 00:01:05.440]  The sixth anniversary of the Black Op military industrial complex sponsored inside job attacks that they intended to form the foundation of the next phase of their tyrannical world government.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.163]  It is actually backfiring on them and 9-11 truth is one of just a few keys.
[00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:16.689]  They can unlock the door and bring down the New World Order.
[00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.193]  They can open the gates against the enemy and bring down their highest and most powerful strongholds.
[00:01:24.755 --> 00:01:28.278]  They overreached, they gambled, and they are in deep trouble.
[00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:33.002]  Top story today up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:01:33.462 --> 00:01:40.548]  Congressman Stockman will eventually collapse and there's a lot of other top experts like the former Federal Reserve Chairman
[00:01:41.272 --> 00:01:43.993]  Paul Volcker saying similar things.
[00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:50.476]  We've got Summers, the former head of the Treasury, saying major corrections, serious recession.
[00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:56.138]  We need to discuss this today, and I'm going to open the phones up in the first hour to talk about the economy.
[00:01:56.538 --> 00:02:06.242]  Dr. Michael Kaufman, who joined us for about 20 minutes last week, will join us for a full hour to talk about how globalists are pushing a world carbon tax and how that hype has reached all-time hysteria.
[00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:22.274]  And we're scheduled to have Aaron Russo's wife, Heidi, the mother of his children, on with us today to talk about a memorial that's being set up and just about his life coming up in the third hour.
[00:02:22.595 --> 00:02:26.537]  Would have had her on yesterday, but she contacted me a few days ago and I hadn't missed her email.
[00:02:26.837 --> 00:02:30.940]  Talked to her yesterday, what a sweetheart she is, and she's really taking it as well as she can.
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.162]  We all need to be praying for that family.
[00:02:34.182 --> 00:02:41.731]  I also talked to his son Max yesterday who sounded pretty depressed as one can imagine losing his father.
[00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:43.813]  So continuing to eulogize
[00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:46.156]  Aaron Russo this week.
[00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:51.260]  We are also going to play the last 10 minutes of the last video interview that he did.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.001]  He did it with us.
[00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:55.123]  We aired that in the first two parts of the last two days.
[00:02:55.143 --> 00:03:04.551]  We'll be airing the third and final part of that today and throughout the week I'm going to continue to air some clips from some of the last radio shows he did with us here as well.
[00:03:04.911 --> 00:03:08.755]  Music manager, film producer, dead at 64 last Friday.
[00:03:09.395 --> 00:03:12.918]  And we're going to continue to eulogize again Aaron Russo, a champion of liberty,
[00:03:13.198 --> 00:03:16.640]  A true maverick in every sense here on the broadcast.
[00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:21.102]  Everybody wants me to talk about it.
[00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:26.824]  I didn't talk about it yesterday, not once, and so we'll come back in the first segment and get into it.
[00:03:26.844 --> 00:03:27.825]  Then I'm getting into the economy.
[00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:31.346]  And that is Larry Craig.
[00:03:32.687 --> 00:03:34.408]  Now, I could look at that Nelly.
[00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:38.550]  You don't need gaydar, as they call it, to be able to tell.
[00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.111]  I mean, if it's a Republican Senator, nine times out of ten,
[00:03:42.273 --> 00:03:43.274]  They're not just gay.
[00:03:46.278 --> 00:03:51.705]  Barney Frank went on, politically incorrect, and acted all high and mighty about Craig.
[00:03:52.325 --> 00:04:01.657]  Craig wasn't caught with 15-year-olds and 14-year-olds in an underage brothel in his three-story Maryland townhouse, Mr. Frank.
[00:04:02.463 --> 00:04:08.248]  Now, Barney Frank went on television and said at the press conference, this is going to end now or I'm going to start naming names.
[00:04:08.568 --> 00:04:13.473]  And the cops and the FBI who had been called in literally stood down and just said, investigation over.
[00:04:14.494 --> 00:04:15.014]  That's right.
[00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.576]  Barney Frank said, you keep your mouth shut.
[00:04:18.097 --> 00:04:18.837]  He came right out.
[00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:19.798]  We ought to find that clip.
[00:04:19.818 --> 00:04:22.240]  I remember seeing it on television back when it happened.
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.381]  It was like 10 years ago.
[00:04:24.282 --> 00:04:27.365]  I remember when that was on TV and it was just there for a day or so and it was gone.
[00:04:28.086 --> 00:04:29.547]  He said, I'm going to start naming names.
[00:04:30.495 --> 00:04:35.219]  Now, if he'd have kept his mouth shut, he'd have died in a bathtub or died in a few days, you know, quote, Arkansas-ed.
[00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:36.800]  But Frank knew what to do.
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.201]  He just went right out and said, look, I'm gonna name names.
[00:04:39.882 --> 00:04:42.524]  And the cops said, they literally said, yes, sir.
[00:04:42.744 --> 00:04:44.605]  Investigation over.
[00:04:46.247 --> 00:04:49.869]  So that bucket of slime, these guys are just something else.
[00:04:49.929 --> 00:04:54.153]  We're going to talk about the real story behind all this when we get back.
[00:04:54.173 --> 00:04:54.573]  Stay with me.
[00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:57.330]  Yeah.
[00:05:01.252 --> 00:05:02.033]  Terrorism!
[00:05:02.173 --> 00:05:02.933]  Terrorism!
[00:05:03.033 --> 00:05:09.097]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallouts, biological attacks, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:05:09.357 --> 00:05:10.959]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.660]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:28.630]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.991]  government.
[00:05:29.151 --> 00:05:30.952]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:05:31.332 --> 00:05:37.233]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:05:37.373 --> 00:05:41.874]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:06:03.752 --> 00:06:09.201]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:17.255]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:17.924 --> 00:06:25.006]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.387 --> 00:06:36.790]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.612]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.092 --> 00:06:43.012]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:47.114]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:00.498 --> 00:07:03.439]  Where do you think one of the most toxic places on earth is?
[00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:04.980]  The answer may surprise you.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.140]  It's in your body.
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.222]  The colon is a natural breeding ground for disease-producing germs.
[00:07:10.482 --> 00:07:14.623]  It may not sound like a very appealing subject, but it should not go ignored.
[00:07:14.763 --> 00:07:21.966]  For over a decade now, natural health expert Dr. Lauren Ritter has educated people everywhere about the benefits of internal cleansing.
[00:07:22.206 --> 00:07:24.467]  Now these benefits include higher energy levels,
[00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:29.011]  More comfortable digestion, high immune support, and healthier looking skin.
[00:07:29.312 --> 00:07:33.936]  Now you can try Dr. Ritter's Colon Cleansing Program from the privacy of your own home.
[00:07:34.317 --> 00:07:38.621]  It's safe and natural, and it gently cleanses the entire digestive tract.
[00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:41.444]  Don't let your body be the most toxic place on earth.
[00:07:41.784 --> 00:07:44.686]  Take care of your health by cleansing your colon and body.
[00:07:44.926 --> 00:07:45.366]  Dial 1-800-890-2014.

[00:07:49.328 --> 00:07:49.708]  Call now.
[00:07:49.748 --> 00:07:53.370]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.211]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:13.658 --> 00:08:19.004]  Here's an example of what we do on this show, this broadcast, six days a week.
[00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:23.529]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, and back on Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:23.549 --> 00:08:23.909]  Central.
[00:08:26.832 --> 00:08:31.057]  We have the background, we have the research, we understand how the Monopoly men operate.
[00:08:31.097 --> 00:08:35.702]  We continually study and interview the top experts in every field.
[00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:39.767]  We're constantly in the game on a wide range of subjects.
[00:08:39.827 --> 00:08:57.340]  So, driving into the office this morning, I heard Neil Bortz on the local station I'm on as well, NewsRadio 590 KLBJ, and I heard him talking about the evil, liberal, environmental activists that are causing problems across the U.S.
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:05.086]  and how they have stopped drilling in Anwar, and how you laid out an area rug in your house
[00:09:06.434 --> 00:09:12.335]  That the area that ANWR covers in Alaska is the size of a quarter, which is pretty much an accurate analogy.
[00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:13.115]  It's a tiny area.
[00:09:13.415 --> 00:09:18.256]  And how it's just frozen tundra, and how the caribou like to sleep underneath the pipelines.
[00:09:18.296 --> 00:09:19.076]  I mean, it was all true.
[00:09:20.297 --> 00:09:20.877]  It was all true.
[00:09:22.797 --> 00:09:26.918]  But then he said the environmentalists keep that from being drilled on.
[00:09:28.578 --> 00:09:33.639]  And how wonderful the oil companies are, and how they want to save us from Al-Qaeda and drill oil here.
[00:09:34.267 --> 00:09:35.408]  That is a complete fraud.
[00:09:35.428 --> 00:09:38.569]  Now, I don't know if Neal Bortz is ignorant, but I tend to think he's not.
[00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.691]  And it is well known and educated in informed circles on energy subjects.
[00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:49.295]  I mean, people that work at refinery plants, wildcatters, oil executives, petroleum geologists.
[00:09:49.895 --> 00:09:50.515]  I live in Texas.
[00:09:50.535 --> 00:09:58.600]  I've got a lot of family from wildcatting to petroleum geologists to you name it, lease hounds, well owners, you name it.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.202]  And so I've always grown up knowing about this.
[00:10:04.409 --> 00:10:08.390]  But we don't have to just talk shop and say, I know people that prove this.
[00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:13.051]  Or I've interviewed all these experts who worked in the oil companies on air and all the proof we've given.
[00:10:14.692 --> 00:10:20.293]  From oil company executives to international bankers to the chaplain for Atlantic Ridgefield.
[00:10:20.313 --> 00:10:21.174]  I mean, we've interviewed them all.
[00:10:21.534 --> 00:10:22.234]  From every angle.
[00:10:22.674 --> 00:10:25.215]  We have the documents in a lawsuit in 2000.
[00:10:27.152 --> 00:10:28.915]  AP reported it in 2001.
[00:10:28.955 --> 00:10:30.517]  We reported on it again last year.
[00:10:30.537 --> 00:10:32.260]  Headline, Peak Oil is a Fraud.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.523]  And you read hundreds of pages of documents.
[00:10:34.543 --> 00:10:34.984]  Go read them!
[00:10:35.004 --> 00:10:35.645]  We link to them!
[00:10:36.334 --> 00:10:38.055]  Well, it says there's too much oil.
[00:10:38.255 --> 00:10:39.555]  We're finding it everywhere.
[00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:42.916]  We've got to buy up the 200 and something refineries in the U.S.
[00:10:43.236 --> 00:10:46.638]  that are independently held between the Big Ten oil companies.
[00:10:46.978 --> 00:10:50.219]  And we need to buy those up and shut them down to create an artificial bottleneck.
[00:10:50.419 --> 00:10:59.342]  And we've got to continue to make sure we don't set up new fields in Alaska because there's more oil up there than in all of Saudi Arabia and Venezuela combined.
[00:11:00.583 --> 00:11:07.887]  One field in Prudhoe Bay, not just Anwar, has more discovered oil than Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:28.557]  I mean, it comes out under such pressure that it takes special pipes and special gauges and special, what's the proper term, gates, to just deal with the pressure.
[00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:33.746]  And I've talked to the people that were there when they were drilling these wells in Capitol.
[00:11:34.106 --> 00:11:34.947]  Oh yeah, that's the other part.
[00:11:34.987 --> 00:11:36.027]  They're all there waiting.
[00:11:37.727 --> 00:11:43.649]  If they built four more pipelines, see they'd have to have four more pipelines, giant pipelines though, just to bring that oil to us.
[00:11:43.689 --> 00:11:49.791]  By the way, over 80% of that oil, and this has even come out in the news, goes to Japan and goes to
[00:11:51.033 --> 00:11:58.197]  China, who then make the slave goods, especially from China, not from Japan, that then come into this nation and de-industrializes.
[00:11:58.658 --> 00:12:01.860]  The oil companies don't want it to flow.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:18.350]  And so they love having some ragamuffins and some well-meaning environmentalists run around, and the TV always gives them attention, and oh, this 50 environmentalists that go out there and tie themselves up to the pipelines, they're the reason there's not drilling up there.
[00:12:19.122 --> 00:12:21.664]  I mean, if you believe that, I got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:12:21.944 --> 00:12:24.566]  When the government wants some rancher's land, they just come take it.
[00:12:25.547 --> 00:12:36.735]  And if the government wants to dump 63 million gallons of nerve gas a few years ago, right off the North Carolina coast, 10 miles off coast, they do it and all the fish die and there's no fishing for years.
[00:12:37.115 --> 00:12:38.416]  And it comes out in the local news.
[00:12:38.596 --> 00:12:41.298]  They want to dump 3 million gallons of nerve gas on the Delaware River?
[00:12:41.718 --> 00:12:43.159]  Just type it into Google, they do it.
[00:12:43.439 --> 00:12:44.120]  Mainline news.
[00:12:45.814 --> 00:12:51.018]  I mean, they'll get on the news and tell you lead and mercury is good for your children and poison and food is good.
[00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:52.479]  I mean, they'll do whatever they want!
[00:12:56.563 --> 00:13:02.868]  And the BBC has even reported, Greg Powell has even reported, that the peak oil scam 12 years ago was cooked up by Dutch Roll Show.
[00:13:03.528 --> 00:13:04.709]  Got the documents on that.
[00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:08.452]  I mean, they basically underwrite National Geographic TV and Magazine.
[00:13:08.652 --> 00:13:09.333]  Have you watched it?
[00:13:09.373 --> 00:13:10.454]  That and Prozac ads.
[00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:14.153]  It's totally fake, okay?
[00:13:14.353 --> 00:13:15.655]  Let's just get that straight.
[00:13:15.956 --> 00:13:17.878]  They're gonna dump nerve gas in the ocean.
[00:13:18.078 --> 00:13:20.822]  They're gonna burn down and cut down the Amazon rainforest.
[00:13:21.162 --> 00:13:27.511]  They're gonna release chimera cross-species organisms everywhere that will totally screw up the planet and
[00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:32.175]  Thousands and thousands of species a year, and the environmentalists aren't going to say a word about it!
[00:13:32.335 --> 00:13:43.963]  They're going to run around in Austin, Texas, and they're going to run around in upstate New York, stealing farmers and ranchers' land, and families are going to cry, and they'll send in SWAT teams and gun down the whole family if they don't come off the land!
[00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:45.244]  It happens all the time!
[00:13:48.487 --> 00:13:50.288]  And it'll be real quiet in the local news!
[00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:53.891]  They do whatever they want, whenever they want!
[00:13:54.091 --> 00:13:56.373]  And that's why I'm sick of meal boards and people like that.
[00:13:58.303 --> 00:14:00.826]  Now, I know they're lying when they say there's no North American Union.
[00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:07.412]  I know they're lying when they say the amnesty and the namnesty, which Bortz doesn't do, but Medved and others, the total slime do do.
[00:14:07.532 --> 00:14:09.074]  Some of them are better than others.
[00:14:10.435 --> 00:14:17.282]  Some are 2% cyanide in the rat poison, in the rat feed, and others like Medved are 80% cyanide.
[00:14:17.302 --> 00:14:17.942]  It doesn't matter.
[00:14:17.962 --> 00:14:19.904]  2%, 5%, 80%, it's going to kill you.
[00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.766]  It's going to kill the country.
[00:14:23.331 --> 00:14:26.212]  And I said I'd get into this Craig guy, but we've already covered all this before.
[00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:27.112]  You know what they are.
[00:14:27.212 --> 00:14:27.992]  It's a guild.
[00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:31.393]  You have to be basically a pedophile to be in the Senate now.
[00:14:32.994 --> 00:14:33.894]  But look, look, look.
[00:14:34.354 --> 00:14:38.576]  All that aside, that's an example of what they do.
[00:14:38.656 --> 00:14:40.176]  See, they go on the air every day.
[00:14:41.116 --> 00:14:42.957]  And they deceive people.
[00:14:44.335 --> 00:14:52.920]  On genetic engineering they say George Washington Carver crossed potatoes and peanuts and lemons and every other plant you can imagine.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.681]  Why crossing things?
[00:14:54.821 --> 00:14:56.242]  That's just hybridization.
[00:14:56.282 --> 00:14:58.002]  What do you think a dog breed is?
[00:14:58.603 --> 00:15:02.405]  But that's taking the existing genetic code of the species
[00:15:02.945 --> 00:15:05.947]  And manipulating it through natural processes.
[00:15:06.188 --> 00:15:16.996]  That's not taking jellyfish genes and putting it in a rhesus monkey so people can buy it for $300 at any Hong Kong major shop so it's a glow-in-the-dark monkey!
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.041]  That's not normal!
[00:15:20.281 --> 00:15:21.382]  That's not natural!
[00:15:21.622 --> 00:15:26.425]  And top Nobel Prize winners and scientists have said, it's given rise to super-viruses.
[00:15:26.745 --> 00:15:29.427]  It's given rise to super-hybrid bacteria.
[00:15:29.727 --> 00:15:31.148]  It's dangerous!
[00:15:31.248 --> 00:15:33.650]  It's literal Russian roulette!
[00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:40.614]  And I want to see you little pig-eyed environmentalists to stop being conned by the oil companies that own you and run you.
[00:15:41.295 --> 00:15:47.619]  And I want to see you get involved in real issues that are hurting the Earth and Homo sapiens sapiens.
[00:15:50.151 --> 00:15:50.951]  I want to see it!
[00:15:51.511 --> 00:15:53.972]  Because I'm concerned about my family and my future!
[00:15:54.132 --> 00:15:56.353]  You bet I'm upset about what's happening to the Earth!
[00:15:56.573 --> 00:15:57.914]  The Earth is in trouble!
[00:15:58.794 --> 00:16:00.815]  You won't get any denials from me on that!
[00:16:06.056 --> 00:16:07.337]  You won't get that, oh no!
[00:16:07.957 --> 00:16:15.179]  But see, they take all of your concern, all your instinctive concern about the planet, and they go, oh yeah, we'll have a global carbon tax!
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.320]  That will be the answer!
[00:16:18.837 --> 00:16:21.358]  And then none of the real environmental problems are dealt with.
[00:16:21.798 --> 00:16:23.579]  Overfishing, the list goes on and on.
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.181]  Thousands of serious problems, because I've researched each area.
[00:16:28.401 --> 00:16:29.402]  I've talked to the experts.
[00:16:29.442 --> 00:16:30.582]  I've looked at the data.
[00:16:33.304 --> 00:16:40.107]  But all they do is put quack government scientists, making millions a year in some cases in research, on TV to put out their propaganda.
[00:16:42.148 --> 00:16:43.908]  So that's an example of how they spend.
[00:16:43.928 --> 00:16:45.329]  The boards will tell you the truth.
[00:16:46.445 --> 00:16:48.547]  about what's happening at ANWR.
[00:16:48.927 --> 00:16:56.792]  But he will not tell you how the oil companies are the ones suppressing it and then blaming the rent-a-mob phony environmentalists.
[00:16:57.473 --> 00:17:09.521]  Just like the media will make jokes about Senator Larry Craig trying to have sex in a bathroom stall.
[00:17:11.603 --> 00:17:14.745]  I didn't even know about this, that this stuff went on, and then I was
[00:17:18.632 --> 00:17:23.215]  When I was single, it was a park down the street from my house and I lived in an apartment so I'd take the dog over there.
[00:17:23.915 --> 00:17:34.422]  I started noticing guys coming in and out of the bathrooms and those park bathrooms and once I was approached in the bathroom and then I was pretty naive I guess when I was 20 years old.
[00:17:34.462 --> 00:17:35.583]  Now I know all about it.
[00:17:35.603 --> 00:17:37.785]  It's been in the news so much and I've done research on it.
[00:17:38.285 --> 00:17:39.886]  But that's the excitement for these guys.
[00:17:39.906 --> 00:17:43.228]  People are saying, why in a bathroom?
[00:17:43.989 --> 00:17:45.690]  Much less one at an airport.
[00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.551]  I mean you can barely get a stall at an airport.
[00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:51.549]  When you need to actually relieve yourself.
[00:17:52.870 --> 00:18:04.459]  In the Minneapolis Airport, this Senator, with his little twinkly eyes, I remember seeing Craig on TV and around the office going, ah, there's one of them!
[00:18:04.739 --> 00:18:16.247]  That guy's a, that guy's a, I might want to call him a flamer and be mean to those folks, he's not even a, I guarantee folks, well, here's a 1980, we're on a break, here's a 1982 report.
[00:18:18.112 --> 00:18:22.476]  Well, they're making the pages have sex with them for their jobs and drugs and the rest of it.
[00:18:24.157 --> 00:18:28.121]  I mean, these guys, folks, most of these phony conservatives, it's a big joke to them.
[00:18:28.821 --> 00:18:31.524]  I mean, they got male mistresses, they're into everything you can imagine.
[00:18:31.884 --> 00:18:37.749]  Most of them, because that's how you join the club, and that's what goes on at Skull and Bones, they introduce you to all that.
[00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.270]  It's pedophilia.
[00:18:42.151 --> 00:18:56.033]  And the 1980s headlines, mainline news about underage callboys, scandal, midnight tours at the White House, then it comes back up, Jeff Gannon, the mailman-um, bringing in the male prostitutes hundreds of times at midnight.
[00:18:56.694 --> 00:18:58.734]  That's what goes on at the White House at midnight, folks.
[00:18:59.674 --> 00:19:04.295]  Now when Bill Clinton's there, it's hooker after hooker after, you know, high dollar, hot blonde.
[00:19:05.335 --> 00:19:10.616]  But with Republicans, predominantly, you've got Frank's a pedophile, Barney Frank, and he's been caught.
[00:19:11.454 --> 00:19:12.875]  Underage male prostitutes.
[00:19:12.895 --> 00:19:17.978]  You know, they weren't 5 years old, like most of the Republicans are into.
[00:19:17.998 --> 00:19:18.699]  They were 14 and 15.
[00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:19.960]  It's still horrible.
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:20.720]  It's very bad.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.383]  And you're not going to see a Dateline NBC investigation over there, are you?
[00:19:25.443 --> 00:19:34.649]  See, they'll tell you about some little edge of the problem, and then misconstrue it, and then tell you the very government that's behind it and running it is you're going to be your savior.
[00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:40.133]  See, just like Neil Bortz only gives you 10% of the info, it's the same thing with them.
[00:19:41.241 --> 00:19:47.568]  It's all just a big joke about a Republican trying to get his kicks in a restroom.
[00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:57.859]  I mean, it's gross, it's disgusting, but it's not as important as how they kidnap children and shoot them in the head with .45s.
[00:20:02.919 --> 00:20:14.191]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:20:14.411 --> 00:20:17.895]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[00:20:18.155 --> 00:20:22.378]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:20:22.658 --> 00:20:26.600]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:33.344]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:20:33.584 --> 00:20:39.067]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[00:20:39.307 --> 00:20:45.531]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light
[00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:48.273]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[00:20:48.333 --> 00:20:48.874]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.

[00:21:01.869 --> 00:21:04.230]  Ted Anderson for Midas August 29, 2007.
[00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:04.890]  Gold 687.
[00:21:05.871 --> 00:21:12.593]  Onscore coins can be purchased for 688.50, 339.70 for half, 169.85 for quarter.
[00:21:12.633 --> 00:21:13.553]  That's 688.50, 339.70, and 169.85.
[00:21:13.994 --> 00:21:17.535]  The dollar has fallen to 65% of the euro.
[00:21:17.655 --> 00:21:18.675]  Erosion accelerates.
[00:21:18.775 --> 00:21:26.118]  Mainline talk show hosts are trying to hold on to their support of the conservative movement, keeping focus on the Republican agenda and playing into the hand of the globalists.
[00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:26.699]  We're good to go.
[00:21:48.843 --> 00:21:50.484]  800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.985 --> 00:21:54.269]  The value of your hard earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.

[00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:04.180]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:13.722]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not directly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.162 --> 00:22:21.364]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.094 --> 00:22:27.600]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:00.948 --> 00:23:03.309]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:13.873]  Did you know that President Kennedy signed into law State Department Publication 7277 entitled, The United States Program for Complete and General Disarmament in a Peaceful World?
[00:23:13.953 --> 00:23:19.156]  This would disarm America and turn all of our armed forces over to the United Nations Organization.
[00:23:19.876 --> 00:23:24.338]  Citizens would be required to turn in their guns guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment.
[00:23:25.032 --> 00:23:30.737]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.
[00:23:31.497 --> 00:23:39.504]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.703]  Folks, up on PrisonPlanet.com, you need to go dig the top story.
[00:24:11.724 --> 00:24:14.306]  Congressman, stock market will eventually collapse.
[00:24:15.787 --> 00:24:20.711]  The Barry Brigade is on there right now trying to hammer it down to make sure that our story doesn't get dug.
[00:24:21.051 --> 00:24:26.616]  They brag that literally hundreds of people on there just watch the site trying to block us, and they celebrate when they're able to.
[00:24:27.056 --> 00:24:38.665]  They shoot us down about, I'd say, 19 out of 20 times, but we're still making it through and reaching millions of people through that crack in the enemy's Berlin Wall of info.
[00:24:39.406 --> 00:24:40.467]  So, we're going to
[00:24:41.604 --> 00:24:42.504]  We're going to break through there.
[00:24:42.725 --> 00:24:43.685]  All right, back to Craig.
[00:24:43.705 --> 00:24:44.725]  I'm not going to spend all day on this.
[00:24:44.745 --> 00:24:47.327]  I've got economy news, environment, world tax news.
[00:24:47.747 --> 00:24:50.288]  Got Aaron Russo's widow coming on today.
[00:24:50.788 --> 00:24:51.328]  Great lady.
[00:24:52.989 --> 00:24:53.989]  This is from 1982.
[00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:58.471]  This is ABC News report.
[00:24:58.892 --> 00:25:01.153]  And just this dealt with Senator Craig.
[00:25:01.173 --> 00:25:03.854]  And this has come up over and over and over again.
[00:25:03.874 --> 00:25:04.174]  Here it is.
[00:25:05.023 --> 00:25:14.888]  An FBI spokesman said today that so far the Bureau has not been able to corroborate charges that congressional pages have been pressured into sexual activity with members of Congress.
[00:25:15.388 --> 00:25:18.950]  And the spokesman said it's not a widespread, organized problem.
[00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:24.633]  Still, it is a scandal, but as Carol Simpson reports now, it cannot be considered surprising.
[00:25:27.333 --> 00:25:33.219]  ABC News talked with a 20-year-old former page who was interviewed by the FBI for two hours yesterday.
[00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:41.987]  He gave investigators the names of members of Congress and congressional staffers he said shared sex and drugs with teenage pages three years ago.
[00:25:42.964 --> 00:25:53.609]  On at least one occasion, a certain official in the house invited several pages out to his house where cocaine and hashish and wine were freely available to the pages.
[00:25:54.249 --> 00:26:04.755]  If you could put a number on the number of congressional employees that you may have direct knowledge of involvement in illicit activity, how many would that be?
[00:26:05.275 --> 00:26:06.876]  Direct knowledge, 15 to 20.
[00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:12.389]  The names of congressmen alleged to be involved in the scandal have remained secret.
[00:26:12.749 --> 00:26:19.232]  But Idaho Republican Congressman Larry Craig, concerned that his name had been implicated, issued a public denial.
[00:26:19.652 --> 00:26:29.317]  Persons who are unmarried, as I am, by choice or by circumstance, have always been the subject of innuendos, gossip, and false accusations.
[00:26:29.637 --> 00:26:31.238]  I think this is despicable.
[00:26:31.818 --> 00:26:37.540]  The charges of wrongdoing by congressmen with pages has been described in a book written by a former page.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:44.742]  In it he states, I knew of at least two homosexual congressmen as did most everyone else at Capitol Page School.
[00:26:45.343 --> 00:26:52.345]  One of these congressmen actively sought out and apparently still seeks out homosexual relationships with minor male pages.
[00:26:53.337 --> 00:26:58.538]  Because he couldn't find a publisher, Stephen Valentine had the book published himself five years ago.
[00:26:59.178 --> 00:27:05.420]  It has been copyrighted by the Library of Congress and can be found on the shelves of the Senate Library in the Capitol.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.421]  Carol Simpson, ABC News, on Capitol Hill.
[00:27:09.441 --> 00:27:18.783]  Alright, we've got a bunch of other clips from over the last 20 plus years, I guess 25 years, where this guy's reign of terror up there.
[00:27:19.284 --> 00:27:20.884]  And he's certainly an unsavory character.
[00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.132]  Now, after he got a lot of heat, he went out and got a beard.
[00:27:24.413 --> 00:27:28.716]  And that's, I guess, the term they developed in Hollywood back in the 50s and 60s for, like, Rock Hudson and others.
[00:27:28.736 --> 00:27:33.921]  They would go have a fake wife, have a woman who they weren't really, you know, having relations with.
[00:27:33.961 --> 00:27:36.804]  They wouldn't normally have children or they'd adopt children.
[00:27:36.844 --> 00:27:43.430]  Sometimes they would just go ahead and have sex to produce offspring to make the staged event more believable.
[00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.932]  And there's no doubt that Larry Craig has a beard.
[00:27:46.634 --> 00:27:56.145]  Uh, his, uh, he's not, uh, his children are not his biological children, and, uh, the lady's a beard for him, is what it really comes down to, because I don't have time to go through it all.
[00:27:56.185 --> 00:27:57.427]  It goes on and on with this guy.
[00:27:57.747 --> 00:28:07.298]  He's caught, this happened a few years ago again, like last year he was in trouble again, and, uh, these guys get addicted to the thrill of doing something naughty and getting caught.
[00:28:08.292 --> 00:28:14.416]  And, uh, so he was basically in an airport stall, pled guilty to it, thinking he could keep it quiet.
[00:28:15.116 --> 00:28:16.637]  And, uh, where there's smoke, there's fire.
[00:28:17.457 --> 00:28:19.458]  This guy is a habitual pervert.
[00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:22.180]  And, uh, it's the tip of the iceberg.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:27.163]  I mean, you've got Foley with the underage people, and you've got... How many Deputy Homeland Security Directors?
[00:28:27.183 --> 00:28:28.023]  There's been two of them?
[00:28:28.744 --> 00:28:30.985]  Caught trying to pick up children?
[00:28:31.005 --> 00:28:32.506]  I mean, children!
[00:28:32.526 --> 00:28:34.227]  We're talking, in one case, under 10 years of age?
[00:28:35.197 --> 00:28:38.880]  That's because you don't get in unless you do this.
[00:28:38.961 --> 00:28:42.864]  And at the higher levels, folks, we've got the reports.
[00:28:42.984 --> 00:28:50.391]  I mean, we're talking about blowing three-year-olds' heads off in the Redwoods in Northern California.
[00:28:50.551 --> 00:28:55.696]  And people that investigate it, their planes get blown up, they get shot, they get run over.
[00:28:57.066 --> 00:29:04.530]  And the FBI raids people's offices just to get the videos and to cover it up, and that's all come out with a Franklin cover-up.
[00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.131]  And let me tell you, 10-15 years ago, I had trouble believing it.
[00:29:07.191 --> 00:29:10.953]  But it just gets verified, verified, verified, verified, verified, verified.
[00:29:11.233 --> 00:29:17.317]  A Virginia TV station said that Senator DeCamp, the top Republican in the state, hired to whitewash it.
[00:29:17.337 --> 00:29:19.178]  He found out it was true, and they killed his investigator.
[00:29:20.578 --> 00:29:22.519]  He sued him and won, what, $1.3 million.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:23.680]  Judgment!
[00:29:24.773 --> 00:29:26.935]  When they said it wasn't true, he said, OK, I'm going to sue you.
[00:29:27.135 --> 00:29:28.136]  Went into court and won.
[00:29:28.477 --> 00:29:29.838]  It's hard to win, folks.
[00:29:31.039 --> 00:29:32.260]  Because this stuff's going on.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.121]  I mean, that's what I say.
[00:29:33.181 --> 00:29:37.085]  These people are hardcore killers.
[00:29:37.905 --> 00:29:39.267]  And they like to hurt children.
[00:29:39.967 --> 00:29:41.589]  And I just want to bring them to justice.
[00:29:41.629 --> 00:29:44.972]  That's all I want to do is bring them to justice.
[00:29:45.433 --> 00:29:46.694]  I want to bring them to justice.
[00:29:51.579 --> 00:29:52.499]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.979 --> 00:29:54.580]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.261]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.562 --> 00:30:05.163]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?

[00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:05.590]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[00:32:05.771 --> 00:32:09.894]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:32:10.501 --> 00:32:15.385]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[00:32:15.906 --> 00:32:22.331]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more!
[00:32:23.087 --> 00:32:25.789]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[00:32:25.949 --> 00:32:35.915]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[00:32:36.176 --> 00:32:39.898]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[00:32:39.938 --> 00:32:42.380]  You know, power companies, government.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.442]  Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[00:32:46.622 --> 00:32:47.663]  Are you ready to go solar?
[00:32:47.863 --> 00:32:48.804]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[00:32:52.727 --> 00:32:56.775]  Or order them on the website at a 10% discount on KenSolar.com.
[00:32:57.015 --> 00:32:59.300]  That's KenSolar.com.
[00:33:16.647 --> 00:33:19.669]  We are number one in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:21.530]  And that ain't saying much, folks.
[00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.591]  We need to grow our numbers and grow them fast.
[00:33:24.631 --> 00:33:37.718]  But this broadcast is number one when it comes to the Truth Movement, the Info Warb, number one when it comes to the Patriot Movement, number one at waking people up.
[00:33:39.474 --> 00:33:43.137]  And that means you, the listeners of this show, are number one.
[00:33:43.758 --> 00:33:49.443]  You are the most active, most aggressive, most informed, most dynamic.
[00:33:50.363 --> 00:33:55.888]  And I am so honored, so honored, to have you as listeners and as fellow activists.
[00:33:56.168 --> 00:33:59.191]  And I don't want you to behind me, I want you right beside me.
[00:34:01.753 --> 00:34:04.636]  That's because we have never tried to sit here and be your leader.
[00:34:05.136 --> 00:34:07.038]  I've always said you're the leaders.
[00:34:08.641 --> 00:34:09.982]  It's about taking action!
[00:34:10.002 --> 00:34:12.362]  It's about getting fired up!
[00:34:14.943 --> 00:34:15.344]  Alright.
[00:34:17.504 --> 00:34:23.267]  I'm going to get back into the economy and then I'm going to get into more on the pervert scandal.
[00:34:23.287 --> 00:34:24.547]  I'm not going to spend too much time on it.
[00:34:24.587 --> 00:34:25.067]  You know it.
[00:34:25.348 --> 00:34:26.148]  You know who they are.
[00:34:26.208 --> 00:34:28.529]  It's a whitewash to just talk about how the guy's a pervert.
[00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:31.570]  That whole crew up there, I mean I'm talking the majority of them.
[00:34:32.246 --> 00:34:38.490]  I mean, they're all totally compromised or they wouldn't even be up there right now.
[00:34:39.171 --> 00:34:50.318]  And the rite of passage for most of them, especially Republicans, don't ask me how this developed, but this is how it is now, they recruit their own people, they bring their own people in, and it's just a guild of them.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:59.044]  But every time, and it's happened like four times now in North Carolina, it's really bad up there,
[00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:01.111]  And it's happened in South Carolina.
[00:35:01.171 --> 00:35:01.951]  It's happened in Georgia.
[00:35:01.971 --> 00:35:02.812]  It's happened in Tennessee.
[00:35:02.852 --> 00:35:03.753]  It's happened in Texas.
[00:35:04.093 --> 00:35:05.334]  It's happened a lot in New York.
[00:35:05.374 --> 00:35:07.075]  For some reason, those places keep popping up.
[00:35:07.975 --> 00:35:08.696]  New York a lot.
[00:35:09.396 --> 00:35:10.337]  Texas, shamefully.
[00:35:10.837 --> 00:35:22.385]  People will have Peace on Earth shirts, and the police think that that's an anti-war shirt, and they say, you can't have that at the mall, and they arrest the city attorney, not knowing who he was, like idiots.
[00:35:25.114 --> 00:35:28.116]  They're on a city street wearing a 9-11's and inside job shirt.
[00:35:28.536 --> 00:35:29.997]  It could be in Dallas, Texas.
[00:35:30.177 --> 00:35:34.380]  It could be in the Netherlands in one of their major cities or even a small town.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.382]  They just say, no, you're not allowed to have 9-11's and inside job shirt.
[00:35:37.442 --> 00:35:38.643]  Not allowed to have 9-11 truth.
[00:35:40.124 --> 00:35:50.270]  And the last five or six times, let me count them up, maybe it's more than that, about seven now, that I hear about somebody with a sign on the side of the road saying impeach Bush.
[00:35:50.771 --> 00:35:51.611]  We contact them.
[00:35:52.031 --> 00:35:52.772]  They've been arrested.
[00:35:52.932 --> 00:35:53.632]  They've been fined.
[00:35:53.893 --> 00:35:54.513]  It's our listener.
[00:35:55.513 --> 00:35:59.476]  Or they've got Ron Paul signs in their yard and upside down flags saying America's in distress.
[00:35:59.776 --> 00:36:02.818]  The cops come, knock on the door, beat them up, take them to jail.
[00:36:03.298 --> 00:36:04.639]  It's admitted in the news.
[00:36:05.039 --> 00:36:07.000]  It's our listeners.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.402]  Last week, two more people in North Carolina
[00:36:10.191 --> 00:36:13.372]  Got arrested for having impeached Bush.
[00:36:13.692 --> 00:36:15.033]  One had a sign, one had a sticker.
[00:36:15.253 --> 00:36:17.694]  I mean, the cops just say, I just came back from Iraq.
[00:36:17.914 --> 00:36:18.995]  That's traitorism.
[00:36:19.175 --> 00:36:20.115]  You're arrested.
[00:36:20.635 --> 00:36:22.416]  They don't know what free speech is, folks.
[00:36:22.456 --> 00:36:23.676]  They think you're an Iraqi.
[00:36:23.956 --> 00:36:25.617]  And over there, they arrest people for their speech.
[00:36:25.657 --> 00:36:28.358]  So they've got an Al-Sarter sticker or something.
[00:36:28.398 --> 00:36:29.859]  They think this is Iraq.
[00:36:30.679 --> 00:36:32.940]  And they're totally, they don't know what America's all about.
[00:36:34.173 --> 00:36:38.515]  Well, sure enough, I hadn't even told my producer yet to get this guy on.
[00:36:38.555 --> 00:36:40.456]  I thought, you know, there's too many of these people being violated.
[00:36:40.476 --> 00:36:43.257]  I can't have them all on.
[00:36:43.277 --> 00:36:55.602]  But it just illustrates how you can have a rally in Memphis, and there's a coffee shop owner, and the Secret Service comes in two days before and says, you're not allowed to have any anti-Bush signs in your window.
[00:36:55.622 --> 00:36:57.603]  And the guy goes, well, I've been a Bush supporter.
[00:37:00.419 --> 00:37:02.960]  I'm a Vietnam vet and I have the right to free speech.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.700]  I'm going to put an anti-Bush sign up now.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.101]  And it turned out they called and threatened everybody.
[00:37:07.181 --> 00:37:08.681]  And then came in and were threatening people.
[00:37:08.961 --> 00:37:10.462]  I mean, this is happening.
[00:37:11.502 --> 00:37:14.643]  I had New York film crews here for the last two days, three days.
[00:37:14.663 --> 00:37:17.744]  I guess Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.
[00:37:17.764 --> 00:37:18.324]  Yeah, three days.
[00:37:18.344 --> 00:37:20.544]  And these are mainline people.
[00:37:21.965 --> 00:37:26.066]  And they've been arrested for just having a camera in New York years ago.
[00:37:28.107 --> 00:37:30.248]  Discovery Channel is going to be following me around in New York.
[00:37:30.429 --> 00:37:34.492]  They have basically been having the cops tell them, we may not even let you film.
[00:37:35.053 --> 00:37:36.794]  I mean, it's just God-like now.
[00:37:36.854 --> 00:37:37.855]  Just, we're God.
[00:37:37.875 --> 00:37:38.816]  End of it.
[00:37:39.016 --> 00:37:39.837]  Learn to worship.
[00:37:40.809 --> 00:37:47.656]  And, sure enough, with this new fella, let me just, we're about to go to Brian Orr, I appreciate holding, but he's a listener and he knows I babble on.
[00:37:47.676 --> 00:37:48.616]  I like to give you all the details.
[00:37:48.957 --> 00:37:50.618]  Here's the local newscast in Florida.
[00:37:51.079 --> 00:37:55.323]  Now, this isn't some homeowner's association with a bunch of control freaks where he moved in.
[00:37:55.583 --> 00:37:59.166]  This is just middle class, regular neighborhood, little bitty Ron Paul sign.
[00:37:59.807 --> 00:38:01.328]  And they started this in Austin, too.
[00:38:01.448 --> 00:38:04.691]  See, this is regulations are where the real tyranny comes in.
[00:38:04.731 --> 00:38:05.392]  It's not even a law.
[00:38:07.131 --> 00:38:19.440]  If you want to put signs up as the official campaign, cities ask you, and it's all selectively enforced, we've seen this with good candidates around here, they get harassed, mainline candidates, scumbag establishment types like Will Wynn, the mayor, he can do whatever he wants.
[00:38:19.921 --> 00:38:22.202]  He can put them, you know, wherever he wants, nothing happens.
[00:38:24.084 --> 00:38:33.711]  It's all selectively enforced, but if you want to put up a sign, they come to you and they say, you've got to sign a form saying if anybody else puts up signs, you're liable for them.
[00:38:34.711 --> 00:38:39.759]  And then you've got to guarantee that all signs will be taken up within five days of the end of the election.
[00:38:42.143 --> 00:38:45.909]  And most people go, okay, I'll comply with your new edict.
[00:38:46.954 --> 00:38:48.015]  And then that sets a precedent.
[00:38:48.295 --> 00:38:52.777]  Doesn't really make it a law, but the idiot with a machine gun and a black mask, I mean, they don't know.
[00:38:53.077 --> 00:38:54.078]  They're like the general public.
[00:38:54.118 --> 00:38:55.558]  They don't know where the country is on a map.
[00:38:55.839 --> 00:38:57.659]  They don't, they know nothing.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.161]  They just know, I got a weapon, you're gonna bow down to the government.
[00:39:01.181 --> 00:39:01.641]  You understand?
[00:39:01.661 --> 00:39:02.882]  That's what America's all about.
[00:39:03.182 --> 00:39:04.583]  Land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[00:39:04.963 --> 00:39:06.104]  And that's the attitude, period.
[00:39:06.284 --> 00:39:06.724]  End of story.
[00:39:07.104 --> 00:39:16.629]  There's still a lot of good cops, a lot of good military left, but more and more, man, I mean, it's, I've had them all over from Texas to New York, California, march up and say, you can't have a video camera walking down the street.
[00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.811]  And they'll just say, look, I'm about to take you to jail.
[00:39:19.851 --> 00:39:20.572]  You understand me, boy?
[00:39:20.592 --> 00:39:25.155]  I mean, it's just bottom line that, hey, they might as well say, the country's dead, scum!
[00:39:25.335 --> 00:39:26.115]  You hear me, slave?
[00:39:26.315 --> 00:39:27.416]  Now, lick my boots!
[00:39:28.377 --> 00:39:29.658]  That's what it's all about now.
[00:39:30.038 --> 00:39:32.580]  And the feds are the ones advising and getting the policies written up.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:45.628]  Well, now they say, and this is in Austin, too, they say, you want to put a little sign in your yard, you've got to sign a form and pay a fee, and then indemnify with insurance for signs citywide.
[00:39:46.152 --> 00:39:50.877]  See, that's a martial law rule where if one person does something wrong, you all get punished.
[00:39:51.738 --> 00:39:52.579]  See how that works?
[00:39:53.961 --> 00:39:58.466]  And you got these guys who were 18, went in the military, they got ADIQs, they're midline retarded.
[00:39:59.273 --> 00:40:03.735]  Uh, they come back here, they got police uniforms, they don't, they'll do whatever they're told.
[00:40:04.155 --> 00:40:06.236]  So let's go ahead and play this newscast and we'll go to him.
[00:40:06.616 --> 00:40:07.156]  Uh, here it is.
[00:40:07.776 --> 00:40:11.037]  A small sign causing a big stir in one central Florida community.
[00:40:11.337 --> 00:40:19.580]  A homeowner put the political sign in his own front yard, but the city gave him until today to get rid of it, or cough up the cash for a fine.
[00:40:19.961 --> 00:40:23.622]  First on Fox, Alexis Brito tells you why the city said that sign has got to go.
[00:40:25.316 --> 00:40:30.137]  Keith, this is the small sign that is causing such a big commotion here in the city of Claremont.
[00:40:30.257 --> 00:40:36.199]  Now, the owner of the sign and the property says that the municipality is actually violating his constitutional rights.
[00:40:36.519 --> 00:40:43.201]  City code enforcement has come by and said that I need to either remove it or I need to pay a $50 fee or deposit, depending on which form you're reading.
[00:40:43.821 --> 00:40:48.364]  Brian Orr was shocked when he was told his political sign was violating a city ordinance.
[00:40:48.384 --> 00:40:51.767]  He says he made sure the size and placement were up to par with the city of Claremont standards.
[00:41:01.073 --> 00:41:07.258]  But he was under the impression that $50 deposit didn't apply to homeowners posting signs on their property.
[00:41:07.278 --> 00:41:08.679]  The politician didn't give me this sign.
[00:41:08.739 --> 00:41:10.360]  I paid for it myself, and it's my sign.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.962]  And I'm solely responsible for this sign.
[00:41:13.022 --> 00:41:15.844]  According to the City of Claremont Ordinance No.
[00:41:16.364 --> 00:41:27.832]  10218, titled Temporary Political Sign, under Section 3, it states, the candidate, or someone designated by the candidate, whose sign is erected or placed on any premises, shall make that deposit.
[00:41:27.972 --> 00:41:30.054]  The concern is that the document lists its
[00:41:31.115 --> 00:41:39.500]  Or says his presidential candidate didn't ask him to place the sign in his front yard.
[00:41:39.781 --> 00:41:41.182]  He did it on his own free will.
[00:41:41.462 --> 00:41:44.744]  Or believes this ordinance refers to local political campaigns.
[00:41:45.124 --> 00:41:47.606]  He says he's confused, and in fact, so are we.
[00:41:47.906 --> 00:41:50.228]  We wanted someone from the city to clarify Ordinance 10218.
[00:41:51.989 --> 00:42:00.353]  We tried numerous attempts to contact James Hitt, Planning and Zoning Director for the City of Claremont on Friday and called City Manager Wayne Saunders at his home Saturday.
[00:42:00.714 --> 00:42:02.495]  We were unsuccessful in reaching them.
[00:42:02.835 --> 00:42:06.177]  Orr says he too has been unable to contact any city leader.
[00:42:06.557 --> 00:42:15.101]  The only response he got was in form of this letter stating he'd be fined $250 if the sign was not removed by 1130 this morning.
[00:42:15.281 --> 00:42:20.124]  The Constitution clearly protects free speech and even though this isn't actually speech
[00:42:20.744 --> 00:42:28.009]  I'm about to go to the actual guest, the man you hear there.
[00:42:28.029 --> 00:42:28.889]  Let me explain something.
[00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.990]  It does protect it.
[00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:30.751]  In fact, where is it?
[00:42:30.791 --> 00:42:34.233]  I'll just read the... I have my pocket Constitution here in front of me.
[00:42:34.273 --> 00:42:36.114]  Well, I can just quote it pretty much verbatim.
[00:42:36.972 --> 00:42:48.897]  Congress shall make no law restricting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or the right of the press, or the right to peaceably assemble for a redress of grievances.
[00:42:48.937 --> 00:42:50.197]  I think I'm leaving one thing out.
[00:42:50.237 --> 00:42:51.758]  My brain is so shot these days.
[00:42:52.258 --> 00:42:53.279]  I'll find my First Amendment.
[00:42:53.339 --> 00:42:54.459]  I can just type it into Google here.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.140]  But let's just go ahead and go to our guest.
[00:42:58.121 --> 00:42:59.141]  That's Brian Orr.
[00:42:59.541 --> 00:43:00.802]  Brian, thank you for joining us.
[00:43:01.662 --> 00:43:02.002]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:02.022 --> 00:43:02.843]  It's great to speak to you.
[00:43:02.923 --> 00:43:03.463]  It's a real honor.
[00:43:04.068 --> 00:43:13.695]  It was great to get your email because I was thinking about already having you on, and then my producer said, hey, this guy with the Ron Paul sign as a listener, it's good to have you on board here.
[00:43:14.176 --> 00:43:15.296]  So what happened with the sign?
[00:43:15.316 --> 00:43:16.177]  Where are we at now?
[00:43:16.217 --> 00:43:17.298]  Have you been fined?
[00:43:17.338 --> 00:43:19.299]  And then, by the way, if you don't pay that, they'll then arrest you.
[00:43:19.319 --> 00:43:21.881]  Go ahead and tell us the story.
[00:43:22.622 --> 00:43:29.167]  Here's basically the way I've decided to handle this, because I've been very fortunate to have a very
[00:43:30.494 --> 00:43:33.316]  Uh, a very, uh, compassionate media, if you will.
[00:43:33.356 --> 00:43:34.457]  You know, that's the way they look at it.
[00:43:34.497 --> 00:43:36.859]  They look like, they look at it like they're helping me out.
[00:43:37.559 --> 00:43:41.582]  Um, and essentially I've had a lot of, uh, a lot of news stations pick this up locally.
[00:43:41.602 --> 00:43:44.764]  Uh, a lot of, uh, local radio stations, things of that nature.
[00:43:44.804 --> 00:43:49.968]  So I've kind of played it from the angle of, uh, I, I've complied with their, with their rule.
[00:43:50.638 --> 00:43:52.380]  They gave me until Saturday to take it down.
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:57.463]  I took it down right at the moment that they said I had to take it down by Fox News was there to view it.
[00:43:57.604 --> 00:43:58.925]  That's essentially what you saw there.
[00:43:59.285 --> 00:44:03.488]  So I'm being very careful because one thing I'm trying to do here is I'm trying to dumb this down.
[00:44:03.828 --> 00:44:13.876]  As you heard there in that last clip, obviously I understand that it's a federal constitutional issue and the sign is as much free speech as any other type of spoken speech.
[00:44:14.256 --> 00:44:20.241]  But what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to dumb this down for the average Claremont citizen, Orlando citizen, who's going to say something
[00:44:20.632 --> 00:44:23.475]  Silly, like, well, it's not speech, it's design, you know, that sort of thing.
[00:44:24.156 --> 00:44:31.163]  And so I've complied for now, I've taken it down, but the ACLU has decided to go ahead and send Claremont a letter.
[00:44:31.658 --> 00:44:35.679]  Saying that they either rewrite the ordinance or H.O.U.
[00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:36.739]  is going to sue them.
[00:44:36.959 --> 00:44:41.120]  But see, when it really triggers though is when they go ahead and violate you.
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:47.762]  I would go ahead and get the ticket and then you're going to have the real leverage and then I'd even let it develop.
[00:44:47.802 --> 00:44:50.323]  When the goons arrest you, you're going to end those cops.
[00:44:50.423 --> 00:44:56.604]  If you want to sue them for false arrest and false imprisonment, you'll own their jet ski and their bimbo wife's house.
[00:44:57.464 --> 00:45:00.165]  And you'll also... And look, I don't like people trying to kill my country.
[00:45:00.445 --> 00:45:01.665]  So don't tell me to lick your boots.
[00:45:01.705 --> 00:45:02.626]  I'm tired of your crime.
[00:45:03.026 --> 00:45:08.787]  It is a crime to try to take this man's sign in his yard, and I don't care what your dirtbag city says.
[00:45:08.828 --> 00:45:10.048]  They're a bunch of scum, too.
[00:45:10.448 --> 00:45:12.369]  I'm sorry, Brian.
[00:45:12.389 --> 00:45:14.049]  I'm just getting sick and tired of it.
[00:45:14.989 --> 00:45:16.070]  Oh, yeah.
[00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:18.890]  I'm glad you're so passionate about it.
[00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:19.391]  I am, too.
[00:45:19.591 --> 00:45:21.251]  My way of looking at it is, yeah.
[00:45:21.371 --> 00:45:23.972]  But another thing that I'm trying to do here is I want to get that sign.
[00:45:24.514 --> 00:45:30.821]  on the media as much as possible, and Fox did a good job with it, ABC, local ABC affiliate did a good job with it.
[00:45:30.881 --> 00:45:35.466]  I didn't like the way that they represented the story, but they did a good job of keep showing that sign, keep showing that sign.
[00:45:35.486 --> 00:45:44.697]  Now, how did they communicate to you that they were going to give you the fine if you didn't submit and take down your sign here in the land of the free, home of the brave?
[00:45:45.966 --> 00:45:56.969]  They sent me a letter, and it was just the most absurd thing, because they had the wrong number on the ordinance, they used the wrong wording, it was just... But they got guys with ADIQs with machine guns!
[00:45:57.529 --> 00:45:57.969]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:45:57.989 --> 00:45:59.449]  What are you going to do about that, huh?
[00:46:00.009 --> 00:46:00.670]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:09.532]  So my plan is that either later today or early tomorrow, once I get word from the ACLU that Claremont has indeed received the letter, I'm going to put it back up in my yard.
[00:46:10.618 --> 00:46:20.870]  I hope that they come back, because then at that point, then we can call Fox News back, we can call everyone back and say, hey, hang out here because someone's going to show up and try to arrest me and I'll see what happens.
[00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:22.773]  Alright, let me give you the full First Amendment.
[00:46:22.793 --> 00:46:24.074]  Let me give you the full First Amendment.
[00:46:24.415 --> 00:46:29.621]  Article 1 of the Bill of Rights, the unanimous declaration here by the states.
[00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:35.556]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:46:35.596 --> 00:46:39.080]  They regulate, totally run the churches now, secretly pay them and tell them what to preach.
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.181]  That's now mainline news.
[00:46:40.341 --> 00:46:41.823]  They totally violate that, totally gone.
[00:46:42.223 --> 00:46:49.871]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech
[00:46:50.812 --> 00:46:56.814]  Or of the press, or of the right of the people to peaceably assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
[00:46:57.034 --> 00:47:03.616]  There are actually cases where the British would try to make political signs be taken down, and that was actually debated.
[00:47:03.656 --> 00:47:08.878]  I've read the Federalist Papers, and so you specifically have Federalist Papers on signage.
[00:47:12.156 --> 00:47:19.765]  I mean, look, remember what happened in Tennessee a few years ago where they arrested the guy for having a sign saying our judicial system is a joke on a country road?
[00:47:19.825 --> 00:47:21.447]  Turned out he was one of the richest guys in the town.
[00:47:21.787 --> 00:47:24.591]  Mainline, old family, no criminal record.
[00:47:24.611 --> 00:47:27.154]  It wasn't even in the right county.
[00:47:27.494 --> 00:47:30.698]  He owned the big lumber yard and hardware store and everything else in town.
[00:47:31.218 --> 00:47:32.698]  And he didn't like a corrupt court release.
[00:47:32.718 --> 00:47:33.939]  He said, our courts are a joke.
[00:47:34.279 --> 00:47:35.299]  And they came and arrested him.
[00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:39.560]  And the judge said, you're not allowed to talk bad of the judicial system and show disrespect.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.821]  Now that judge, by the way, got kicked off the bench later.
[00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:43.601]  But see, they're delusional.
[00:47:44.062 --> 00:47:45.502]  They think they're God.
[00:47:45.702 --> 00:47:47.042]  And I got news for you.
[00:47:47.182 --> 00:47:48.403]  You're not my God.
[00:47:48.583 --> 00:47:50.223]  And I'm glad you're doing this, Brian.
[00:47:50.603 --> 00:47:52.604]  God bless you for standing up to this trash.
[00:47:53.351 --> 00:47:59.673]  Well, I really appreciate it, yeah, and essentially what I'm trying to do is, because this isn't about me, this is about the integrity of the U.S.
[00:47:59.713 --> 00:48:12.018]  Constitution, this is about the integrity of our country, and I'm trying to take our country back in my little silly yard sign way, if you want to look at it that way, as a lot of people do, but I've been amazed how many people have called me, looked me up,
[00:48:12.518 --> 00:48:17.180]  They've just told me, hey listen, this is great, and a lot of them aren't people who are in the movement that we're in.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.101]  We're plugged into this stuff every day.
[00:48:19.141 --> 00:48:25.223]  But I've seen people, just because of this yard sign, who probably haven't thought about this in years, who are coming to me and saying, you know what?
[00:48:25.283 --> 00:48:27.464]  Our government is screwed up, and this needs to change.
[00:48:27.504 --> 00:48:28.464]  And that's what I want to see.
[00:48:28.484 --> 00:48:31.805]  I want to see people who aren't plugged in come, you know, get plugged into this movement.
[00:48:31.825 --> 00:48:32.826]  Well, I agree with you, Brian.
[00:48:33.126 --> 00:48:40.669]  And they can put all the spin, and they can dress this up as much as they want, but it's just like taking a big fat hog out of a slop pit.
[00:48:41.249 --> 00:48:41.810]  We're good to go.
[00:48:57.077 --> 00:48:57.617]  You know what?
[00:48:58.237 --> 00:49:09.040]  And everybody knows instinctively that you not being able to have a yard sign in... I mean, even homeowners associations, you know, don't have prohibitions, most of them against political signs, because that's understood.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.321]  And you contract and agree to that!
[00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:14.982]  No, this is the city saying you can't near a yard, and it's bull!
[00:49:16.169 --> 00:49:17.770]  Oh yeah, I mean, this property has been here.
[00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.811]  This is one of the oldest houses in Claremont.
[00:49:19.831 --> 00:49:21.311]  This property has been here forever.
[00:49:21.771 --> 00:49:28.574]  And the point is, is that there's no, you know, these city council people think they can just sit there, agree on something, write a law, and that everyone has to obey them.
[00:49:28.914 --> 00:49:33.536]  And that's the, you know, that's what's so absurd about this, is they're taking the position, they will not even talk to me.
[00:49:33.576 --> 00:49:35.657]  They will not talk to the media, they will not talk to anyone.
[00:49:35.957 --> 00:49:38.619]  And their only argument is, well, this law's been on the books since 1980.
[00:49:40.089 --> 00:49:40.810]  Well, it's simple.
[00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:41.430]  It's simple.
[00:49:42.951 --> 00:49:46.614]  You know, they used to argue, well, blacks have been slaves for 300 years.
[00:49:46.654 --> 00:49:47.415]  They're not human.
[00:49:47.915 --> 00:49:52.079]  Just because they're getting up and even saying they want to be free, you know, they're not humans.
[00:49:52.139 --> 00:49:53.220]  And the blacks said, you know what?
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:53.860]  I am a human.
[00:49:54.981 --> 00:50:00.465]  And next time you slap me upside the head with that axe handle, I'm going to break it over your head.
[00:50:01.086 --> 00:50:07.471]  And let me tell you, when the axe handle started breaking over heads, and cities later started burning, all that bull started stopping.
[00:50:08.749 --> 00:50:09.950]  And that's what I'm talking about!
[00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:11.850]  Yep, yep, yep.
[00:50:12.211 --> 00:50:12.611]  I'm with you 100%.
[00:50:12.711 --> 00:50:19.234]  And essentially the only reason I'm not, the only reason I don't have a Ron Paul banner is it's covering my entire front yard.
[00:50:19.716 --> 00:50:29.942]  It's because, you know, unfortunately I am, you know, I, I, maybe you tell me if I'm wrong, but the way I'm, I'm trying to play into the media's hands a little bit, because I want them to keep, I want them to keep coming out.
[00:50:30.042 --> 00:50:37.727]  I want them to keep... No, no, no, you're being very, uh, you know, you're just standing up for your rights in a very calm, professional way, and, uh, you're just showing everybody who we're dealing with here.
[00:50:37.747 --> 00:50:44.551]  Uh, as this develops, Brian, keep us abreast of things, and call in any time there's a development, we'll put you right to the head of the line and get you on.
[00:50:44.571 --> 00:50:46.953]  Uh, I want to thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:50:47.683 --> 00:50:48.244]  Oh, thank you, sir.
[00:50:48.264 --> 00:50:48.725]  I appreciate it.
[00:50:48.925 --> 00:50:50.246]  Any websites or anything you want to plug?
[00:50:50.967 --> 00:50:51.388]  Uh, no.
[00:50:51.448 --> 00:50:56.674]  The only thing I would say, if anyone wants to get a hold of me, they can contact me at IntegrityParty at Yahoo.com.
[00:50:57.155 --> 00:50:57.475]  Awesome!
[00:50:57.696 --> 00:50:58.517]  Brian, keep it up!
[00:51:04.179 --> 00:51:09.647]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.008 --> 00:51:17.599]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.351 --> 00:51:25.395]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.795 --> 00:51:37.221]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.541 --> 00:51:41.103]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.504 --> 00:51:43.425]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.765 --> 00:51:47.607]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:00.928 --> 00:52:01.708]  Terrorism.
[00:52:01.848 --> 00:52:02.609]  Terrorism.
[00:52:02.709 --> 00:52:08.752]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:52:09.032 --> 00:52:10.633]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:52:10.873 --> 00:52:13.334]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:13.734 --> 00:52:28.301]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:28.341 --> 00:52:28.661]  government.
[00:52:28.821 --> 00:52:30.642]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:52:31.002 --> 00:52:36.905]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:52:37.065 --> 00:52:41.548]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[00:52:41.808 --> 00:52:47.471]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:49.432]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:49.452 --> 00:52:51.213]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:04.911]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:53:05.332 --> 00:53:08.253]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:53:08.573 --> 00:53:11.133]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:53:11.514 --> 00:53:16.335]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:53:16.715 --> 00:53:22.077]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:53:22.377 --> 00:53:25.338]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:53:25.538 --> 00:53:26.098]  We're good to go.
[00:53:48.929 --> 00:53:54.150]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:54.490]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:54.970]  Federal agents!
[00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:55.631]  We are armed!
[00:54:12.686 --> 00:54:14.407]  We're good to go.
[00:54:45.171 --> 00:54:47.913]  I see a message from the government like every day.
[00:54:48.194 --> 00:54:50.756]  I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[00:54:51.056 --> 00:54:53.117]  They wanted me about Osama or whatever.
[00:54:53.358 --> 00:54:55.019]  Picture me buying this scam.
[00:54:55.079 --> 00:54:55.880]  I said never.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.941]  You in tune to a hard truth.
[00:54:58.001 --> 00:54:58.762]  Soldiers spitting.
[00:54:58.922 --> 00:54:59.643]  I stay committed.
[00:54:59.663 --> 00:55:01.364]  Give up because I lose commission.
[00:55:01.584 --> 00:55:04.086]  It's all a part of fighting devil's state mind control.
[00:55:04.206 --> 00:55:06.388]  And all about the battle for your body, mind and soul.
[00:55:06.408 --> 00:55:06.968]  We're good to go.
[00:55:28.055 --> 00:55:29.376]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:29.396 --> 00:55:39.184]  We're about to start the second hour with Dr. Michael Coffman to really get into the global tax, what's really happening with oil supplies, where this is all going, the master plan.
[00:55:39.224 --> 00:55:45.429]  He's a big part of Endgame, by the way, that is going to be in theaters right here in Austin.
[00:55:45.449 --> 00:55:45.890]  That's it.
[00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:46.790]  Sneak peek.
[00:55:47.071 --> 00:55:48.232]  Won't be out until October.
[00:55:50.473 --> 00:55:50.613]  It's
[00:55:51.431 --> 00:55:53.992]  It's going to be on the 4th, 5th, and 6th.
[00:55:54.292 --> 00:56:01.154]  So that's going to be on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:56:01.174 --> 00:56:04.214]  Then it's going to be shown on Sunday the 9th in New York.
[00:56:04.234 --> 00:56:06.095]  Details at WeAreChange.org on that showing.
[00:56:06.355 --> 00:56:10.796]  But go to InfoWars.com for the 4th, 5th, and 6th showing next week.
[00:56:10.856 --> 00:56:11.997]  And they always sell out.
[00:56:12.057 --> 00:56:13.357]  Get your tickets online now.
[00:56:13.697 --> 00:56:16.698]  And then about an hour before showtime, they sell like 20 tickets at the door.
[00:56:17.298 --> 00:56:20.719]  So if you miss out, that's another way to try to line up and get them there.
[00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:24.292]  But the first showing is getting close to selling out.
[00:56:25.252 --> 00:56:26.553]  And the second showing is getting close.
[00:56:26.573 --> 00:56:28.735]  The third is still got a lot left for that Thursday.
[00:56:29.155 --> 00:56:30.696]  I'll be there giving a speech at each event.
[00:56:30.716 --> 00:56:33.158]  And when I come back on the 17th, I'm going to New York.
[00:56:34.359 --> 00:56:38.802]  On the 17th of this month, we'll also be showing it there at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:56:40.223 --> 00:56:44.066]  Then later in November and December, it's going to be shown at select theaters around the country here and there.
[00:56:44.106 --> 00:56:45.827]  And so we can tell you about that later, but that's being set up.
[00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:53.173]  Right now, we're finishing up the trailer for the film this week, and that'll be out by next Tuesday after the holiday.
[00:56:53.193 --> 00:56:57.475]  We're also building a website that'll be up next week as well.
[00:56:58.835 --> 00:57:01.637]  For Endgame, I've seen 14 months.
[00:57:02.197 --> 00:57:04.638]  I started back in April of 2006.
[00:57:04.878 --> 00:57:11.541]  That's like 16 months working on this sucker, or longer.
[00:57:13.922 --> 00:57:16.583]  Alright, we're going to start the second hour here in just a moment.
[00:57:16.603 --> 00:57:17.644]  I want to tell you about bed fan.
[00:57:17.664 --> 00:57:22.946]  You know, this way you don't have to have your air conditioner down at 65 to keep it at 80 under the covers.
[00:57:22.986 --> 00:57:24.266]  You know how you get the room real cold?
[00:57:24.326 --> 00:57:25.647]  Most of us like to sleep in a cold room.
[00:57:25.667 --> 00:57:26.167]  I know I do.
[00:57:26.387 --> 00:57:27.568]  It's very crisp and refreshing.
[00:57:28.088 --> 00:57:31.489]  But then, it still gets hot under the covers.
[00:57:31.529 --> 00:57:32.530]  Well, this is a little fan.
[00:57:33.408 --> 00:57:34.649]  You've got to go to the website and check it out.
[00:57:34.669 --> 00:57:35.269]  It's so cool.
[00:57:35.329 --> 00:57:36.009]  I mean, they invented it.
[00:57:36.029 --> 00:57:36.549]  It's an inventor.
[00:57:36.629 --> 00:57:40.011]  It's very well designed, very nice, and very inexpensive.
[00:57:40.331 --> 00:57:47.374]  And it just slides up in between the bed, at the base of the bed, or at the top of the bed, and it just puts a little bit of air underneath the covers.
[00:57:47.474 --> 00:57:48.655]  It's a great way to sleep.
[00:57:49.155 --> 00:57:57.018]  Bedfan.com, B-E-D-F-A-N.com, or there's banners up on Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Bedfan.com.
[00:57:57.278 --> 00:58:00.980]  From Tompkins Research and their supporters of the show, their listeners of the show,
[00:58:01.895 --> 00:58:02.595]  Great Patriots.
[00:58:03.095 --> 00:58:04.396]  Check them out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:04.676 --> 00:58:08.437]  Click on the banner on InfoWars to purchase Hot Sleepers Cooler.
[00:58:08.797 --> 00:58:11.838]  Lower your electric bill by more than 25% on monthly savings.
[00:58:12.239 --> 00:58:15.460]  Pays for itself by saving on the electric bill.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.140]  Works instantly.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.460]  No tools or assembly required.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.241]  Gives you a deep, restful sleep.
[00:58:19.981 --> 00:58:22.362]  And see, I always run the fan real fast.
[00:58:23.062 --> 00:58:23.642]  Ceiling fan.
[00:58:23.682 --> 00:58:24.763]  It gives you even more than that.
[00:58:25.803 --> 00:58:26.903]  No more tossing and turning.
[00:58:26.944 --> 00:58:28.204]  Say goodbye to sleepless nights.
[00:58:29.708 --> 00:58:33.052]  Ladies and gentlemen, give them a call, 1-800-738-0477, 1-800-738-0477, or bedfan.com, second hour, straight ahead.
[00:58:33.172 --> 00:58:37.517]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com, or call 877-300-7777.
[00:58:57.555 --> 00:58:58.215]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.875 --> 00:58:59.936]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.636 --> 00:59:01.816]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.396 --> 00:59:03.236]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.977 --> 00:59:04.897]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.537 --> 00:59:09.218]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.718 --> 00:59:13.819]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:32.128 --> 00:59:42.273]  By the way, there is a radio station owner, great guy, I keep playing phone tag with him for weeks, I talked to him years ago, who put me on in Southern California going into San Diego and several other cities.
[00:59:42.913 --> 00:59:50.057]  He's a Texan, and he just got a new radio station, 1330 AM, out of Cameron, Texas.
[00:59:50.297 --> 00:59:52.258]  And I just thought, hey, I'll tune into that today.
[00:59:53.095 --> 00:59:54.436]  Driving into work, and guess who I heard?
[00:59:54.496 --> 00:59:58.457]  I heard Derry Brownfield coming in pretty good in South Austin in my car.
[00:59:59.037 --> 00:59:59.737]  It's in Cameron.
[00:59:59.757 --> 01:00:00.918]  It covers quite a few towns.
[01:00:01.278 --> 01:00:04.839]  Cameron's way outside Austin, but it covers large portions of Austin very good.
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:10.661]  It starts to cut down a little bit in South Austin, but it's nice to be on there in the week in Austin again.
[01:00:10.681 --> 01:00:20.185]  I'm doing a Sunday show in Kelby J. They wanted me to do a weeknight show and syndicate it out of there, and I just said, look, I can't do another show five days a week.
[01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:23.259]  So let's do a syndicated show on Sunday, and that's been very successful.
[01:00:23.719 --> 01:00:25.941]  Very thankful to all our affiliates out there that are picking that up.
[01:00:26.742 --> 01:00:29.764]  But very excited to have KMIL.
[01:00:29.944 --> 01:00:30.905]  I believe that's the right call.
[01:00:30.925 --> 01:00:31.665]  I'm going from memory.
[01:00:36.127 --> 01:00:41.448]  I ought to get that station owner on, because that's really important to be able to be heard in Austin.
[01:00:41.508 --> 01:00:50.430]  Pretty good in your car, not too good inside your office, but hey, it is better than nothing, and it's a great station with a great lineup, and it's carrying a lot of Genesis broadcast.
[01:00:50.890 --> 01:00:55.891]  So we are very excited about that, and I want to get the station owner on the show as a guest.
[01:00:55.911 --> 01:00:57.012]  He wants me to cut some liners.
[01:00:57.492 --> 01:00:58.332]  I was looking for them in my email.
[01:00:58.352 --> 01:01:03.753]  I don't know if Ted sent me those yet, but I want to have him on the show, because we've got a lot of great affiliates out there.
[01:01:04.233 --> 01:01:07.918]  Some of them are very near and dear to me, like the Sunshine Network in upstate New York.
[01:01:08.178 --> 01:01:09.340]  We've been on like 8 years.
[01:01:10.181 --> 01:01:12.283]  KCXL, we've been on about 8 years.
[01:01:13.104 --> 01:01:15.907]  Stations like WBCR, we've been on 8 years.
[01:01:16.688 --> 01:01:19.171]  And a few others, we've been on 5, 6, 7 years, a lot of others.
[01:01:19.672 --> 01:01:21.414]  But just to have one in Austin.
[01:01:21.915 --> 01:01:23.417]  Because this goes back to LBJ.
[01:01:24.845 --> 01:01:27.227]  Speak of the devil.
[01:01:27.247 --> 01:01:39.175]  He, when he became a congressman, made sure that about half the licenses for radio that should be given out for Austin were given out, and this is part of the mainline history books, and he made sure that only one TV station was given out.
[01:01:39.515 --> 01:01:46.120]  Until the mid-seventies, there was one TV station in Austin, and that was, it's now the Fox Affiliate.
[01:01:47.581 --> 01:01:49.583]  And then that monopoly got broken up.
[01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:52.486]  My mother, growing up here, only had one TV station.
[01:01:52.766 --> 01:01:57.170]  They'd go visit family in Dallas and see five, six stations and thought they'd gone to Valhalla.
[01:01:57.650 --> 01:01:58.631]  Can you imagine having
[01:01:59.768 --> 01:02:02.470]  Uh, but my mom said it was weird because they'd air like the news back-to-back.
[01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:05.553]  You get ABC, CBS, and NBC News back-to-back.
[01:02:05.593 --> 01:02:07.474]  Some nights of the Johnsons felt like it.
[01:02:07.714 --> 01:02:13.118]  Sometimes if he was out at the ranch and wanted to see something, he'd call the TV station up and say, play that newscast again!
[01:02:13.138 --> 01:02:15.720]  I mean, it was like his own little private tinker toy.
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:18.622]  And he owned KLBJ, not owned by him anymore.
[01:02:18.662 --> 01:02:19.543]  You wouldn't hear me on there.
[01:02:19.563 --> 01:02:23.226]  Well, I bet Lady Bird was flopping around in her last days hearing me on there.
[01:02:23.966 --> 01:02:28.890]  Uh, but, uh, because you said one word about the Johnsons, you were fired in two seconds.
[01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:31.703]  But I'm already digressing.
[01:02:31.983 --> 01:02:33.724]  So there's not as many talk stations.
[01:02:33.744 --> 01:02:34.964]  There's really only two in Austin.
[01:02:35.784 --> 01:02:37.265]  And KLBJ is big all over the state.
[01:02:37.285 --> 01:02:39.905]  It's one of the tops in the top five stations in the state, listener-wise.
[01:02:41.105 --> 01:02:43.266]  You can hear it in Dallas, Antonio, Houston, everywhere.
[01:02:43.546 --> 01:02:47.167]  It's got a great broadcast thing.
[01:02:47.207 --> 01:02:52.568]  But to be on 1330 is just so amazingly exciting.
[01:02:53.108 --> 01:02:54.908]  Because you can hear your car pretty darn good.
[01:02:54.928 --> 01:02:57.169]  A lot of areas in Austin, it comes in crisp and clear.
[01:02:57.839 --> 01:03:02.742]  But see, I hadn't tested it when I was listening to Genesis programming to hear Genesis shows on blasting in.
[01:03:03.762 --> 01:03:05.003]  But like I said, it's exciting.
[01:03:05.043 --> 01:03:07.764]  So 1330, I am done salivating over that.
[01:03:08.124 --> 01:03:12.126]  Dr. Michael Coffman will be our guest when we get back on the other side.
[01:03:13.067 --> 01:03:22.172]  But that is just so thrilling to end this town where we've woken up so many people and where so many people watch the TV show and tune in on the internet or the local micros on 90.1.
[01:03:23.172 --> 01:03:24.633]  Doing a great job there in the league.
[01:03:26.133 --> 01:03:32.559]  But to, at 100.1, but to be on the AM, that is exciting.
[01:03:33.199 --> 01:03:36.422]  To get past the Johnson blockade in every way!
[01:03:36.442 --> 01:03:42.827]  I mean, I'm on KLBJ, getting past their blockade, and I'm on another station coming into Austin, getting around the blockade.
[01:03:43.248 --> 01:03:43.948]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:43.968 --> 01:03:44.369]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.921 --> 01:03:55.961]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:03:56.281 --> 01:03:59.062]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:03:59.342 --> 01:04:03.484]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:04.744]  So what do you do?
[01:04:05.064 --> 01:04:09.646]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:04:10.126 --> 01:04:12.248]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:04:12.749 --> 01:04:13.630]  Sheltering in place.
[01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:17.774]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[01:04:18.074 --> 01:04:27.443]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:04:27.483 --> 01:04:34.550]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:39.293]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[01:04:56.073 --> 01:05:01.519]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:09.528]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.208 --> 01:05:17.271]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.671 --> 01:05:29.096]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.396 --> 01:05:32.938]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.358 --> 01:05:35.299]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.619 --> 01:05:39.401]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:52.887 --> 01:05:55.828]  Where do you think one of the most toxic places on earth is?
[01:05:56.108 --> 01:05:57.368]  The answer may surprise you.
[01:05:57.548 --> 01:05:58.528]  It's in your body.
[01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:02.629]  The colon is a natural breeding ground for disease-producing germs.
[01:06:02.869 --> 01:06:07.011]  It may not sound like a very appealing subject, but it should not go ignored.
[01:06:07.171 --> 01:06:14.372]  For over a decade now, natural health expert Dr. Lauren Ritter has educated people everywhere about the benefits of internal cleansing.
[01:06:14.612 --> 01:06:16.853]  Now these benefits include higher energy levels,
[01:06:17.113 --> 01:06:21.394]  More comfortable digestion, high immune support, and healthier looking skin.
[01:06:21.714 --> 01:06:26.316]  Now you can try Dr. Ritter's Colon Cleansing Program from the privacy of your own home.
[01:06:26.696 --> 01:06:30.997]  It's safe and natural, and it gently cleanses the entire digestive tract.
[01:06:31.177 --> 01:06:33.858]  Don't let your body be the most toxic place on earth.
[01:06:34.178 --> 01:06:37.019]  Take care of your health by cleansing your colon and body.
[01:06:37.319 --> 01:06:37.479]  Dial 1-800-890-2014.
[01:06:37.499 --> 01:06:37.699]  That's 1-800-890-2014.
[01:06:37.719 --> 01:06:40.100]  Call now to find out how you can get the colon and body cleanse risk-free for 30 days.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:40.461]  Dial 1-800-890-2014.
[01:06:40.481 --> 01:06:40.721]  Call now.
[01:06:40.741 --> 01:06:41.501]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:41.521 --> 01:06:42.942]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.051 --> 01:07:11.432]  Well, he's got a new documentary film out.
[01:07:12.572 --> 01:07:15.012]  It's Global Warming or Global Governance.
[01:07:16.113 --> 01:07:21.174]  And we had him on for about 20 minutes last week, but I wanted to have him up for a full hour today.
[01:07:21.734 --> 01:07:29.375]  Then we're scheduled to have Aaron Russo's widow, Heidi Gregg, on to talk about him for about 30 minutes in the next hour.
[01:07:31.576 --> 01:07:33.436]  So that's coming up as well.
[01:07:33.536 --> 01:07:36.077]  And in the last 30 minutes, I'm going to talk about economic issues.
[01:07:37.134 --> 01:07:44.017]  And what is happening right now with the stock market, with the dollar, with the inflationary bubble.
[01:07:44.377 --> 01:07:47.718]  Big article up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[01:07:47.738 --> 01:07:49.358]  Stock market will eventually collapse.
[01:07:49.939 --> 01:07:53.280]  Also a big story going up on Jones Report in the next hour or two.
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:08:03.783]  JonesReport.com with a big rundown of the events and what's going to be happening in association with We Are Change and others in New York on the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th.
[01:08:05.624 --> 01:08:07.606]  And I'll be there the 8th through the 11th.
[01:08:07.646 --> 01:08:13.510]  I'll depart on the 12th and we're going to be premiering Endgame up there in New York.
[01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:15.492]  And all proceeds go to firefighters and police.
[01:08:15.532 --> 01:08:16.452]  I'm not even handling that.
[01:08:16.472 --> 01:08:19.155]  It's just going to them there with the ticket proceeds.
[01:08:19.875 --> 01:08:22.777]  So I get not a zip, not a nickel.
[01:08:22.817 --> 01:08:23.738]  I want to make that clear.
[01:08:23.778 --> 01:08:24.859]  I'm not saying, oh, we're good.
[01:08:24.879 --> 01:08:25.619]  We're giving them money.
[01:08:25.659 --> 01:08:28.181]  But I just want to make that clear so you know that it goes to them.
[01:08:30.163 --> 01:08:33.886]  Continuing here, this is so important because
[01:08:36.391 --> 01:08:40.694]  I talked about Neil Bortz in the last hour, a big national talk show host that attacks us almost every day.
[01:08:41.055 --> 01:08:47.639]  He gets up there and he says, oh my gosh, ANWR is the size of a quarter up in Alaska compared to a big area rug in your living room.
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:51.402]  And it won't hurt the environment to drill, but the environmentalists are stopping us from drilling.
[01:08:51.923 --> 01:08:58.067]  But then we have the oil company documents where there's so much oil that they created the fraud of Peak Oil 12 years ago.
[01:08:58.147 --> 01:09:01.069]  Dutch Rochelle financed it through Russian and British and U.S.
[01:09:01.089 --> 01:09:01.490]  scientists.
[01:09:01.530 --> 01:09:02.130]  That's public.
[01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:03.011]  They've been caught.
[01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:03.951]  No debate!
[01:09:04.011 --> 01:09:04.612]  I mean, caught!
[01:09:05.132 --> 01:09:05.692]  It's staged!
[01:09:05.752 --> 01:09:06.533]  There's too much oil!
[01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:14.456]  And they also finance the major environmental groups to actually go shut off other areas of, say, clean-burning coal in Idaho.
[01:09:15.177 --> 01:09:16.577]  They could run the country for hundreds of years.
[01:09:16.617 --> 01:09:18.378]  That was a big thing that Clinton did.
[01:09:19.338 --> 01:09:20.899]  Idaho went into several states below it.
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:24.401]  They run all sorts of scams, and they only
[01:09:25.209 --> 01:09:27.070]  We're not saying the environment doesn't have problems.
[01:09:44.992 --> 01:09:56.235]  What we're saying is that the modern mainline environmental movement was founded by the Rockefellers, is all pushed by eugenicists, it's neo-feudalism, and they say this in UN documents.
[01:09:56.875 --> 01:10:06.337]  And the man that we interviewed for like three days when he was here, for Endgame, and who you see throughout the film on multiple issues, because it's all tied together, is Dr.
[01:10:07.443 --> 01:10:08.884]  I am always happy to come along with you, Alex.
[01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:09.424]  It's always a good show.
[01:10:33.421 --> 01:10:53.537]  I know most of our audience are experts on this, because they've heard you and many other people who've been on the inside of this studying it throughout the years, but for the general public tuning in for the first time, can you break down what the globalists, who they are, what their agenda is, and how they're using environmentalism, and what the global tax is and what it's going to mean?
[01:10:54.738 --> 01:10:56.180]  Over the last 100 years, almost 150 years, there have been
[01:10:58.399 --> 01:11:21.825]  The royalty of Europe and the international industrialists and the financiers, primarily the banking financiers, that have created a monopoly, basically, on a lot of different areas of trade, international trade and so forth, and they've become extremely powerful, and they are looking towards actually controlling everything.
[01:11:21.865 --> 01:11:23.486]  Just as you were describing about big oil,
[01:11:24.096 --> 01:11:30.441]  They're looking to control almost every aspect of our society, how you and I can behave, what we can do, what we cannot do.
[01:11:30.461 --> 01:11:32.783]  It's called the global cartel.
[01:11:34.324 --> 01:11:44.513]  Carol Quigley wrote about them back in the 1960s, that basically defines the fact that they are a globalist effort that bring all power unto themselves.
[01:11:44.573 --> 01:11:47.215]  They're using the United Nations as an affront.
[01:11:47.815 --> 01:11:50.858]  If the United Nations doesn't work, they'll discard it and create something else.
[01:11:51.463 --> 01:12:08.116]  In order to maintain this control over us, and they're using a variety of different international treaties to establish the international law and the bureaucracy that is not accountable to the American people or to anybody else in the world, that will define what we can and cannot do.
[01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:14.854]  Much of this is actually outlined in what's called Agenda 21 that came out of the 1992 Earth Summit.
[01:12:14.994 --> 01:12:28.344]  Our listeners are always wanting to know more about that, and since I covered it ten years ago, and you've been covering it forever, later in the show, make sure you set some time aside, Doctor, to kind of focus in on exactly what Agenda 21 is.
[01:12:28.424 --> 01:12:30.265]  In fact, you can get into that now if you'd like.
[01:12:31.246 --> 01:12:32.667]  Well, Agenda 21, I think, is a 42 or 40 or 42 chapter document.
[01:12:35.888 --> 01:12:40.912]  That basically defines everything about what we can and cannot do in the world.
[01:12:41.233 --> 01:12:41.673]  Literally.
[01:12:42.194 --> 01:12:43.835]  It defines our social morals.
[01:12:44.275 --> 01:12:49.700]  It defines exactly what we can do, what kind of activities we can have, what kind of property rights we can have.
[01:12:50.521 --> 01:12:51.982]  It defines almost everything.
[01:12:52.102 --> 01:12:53.003]  It's a soft law.
[01:12:53.023 --> 01:12:54.845]  In other words, it doesn't have teeth to back it up.
[01:12:55.565 --> 01:13:02.932]  But it was attempted to actually implement it by creating and bringing in what is called the Earth Charter, which is a religious document
[01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:05.345]  That defines based on religious purposes.
[01:13:05.365 --> 01:13:08.366]  Would you call it a game plan or manifesto or blueprint?
[01:13:08.967 --> 01:13:09.747]  It's a blueprint.
[01:13:09.807 --> 01:13:10.707]  It's really what it is.
[01:13:10.888 --> 01:13:15.270]  And it literally, if you read it, it is incredible reading.
[01:13:15.490 --> 01:13:26.495]  Well, I mean, reading biological diversity treatises and other things that I got directly from the library, what's the particular one, I've got it in Road to Tyranny, where they say we need to reinstitute human sacrifice on a mass scale?
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:27.360]  Yes.
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:29.061]  In fact, the documents that we gave the U.S.
[01:13:29.081 --> 01:13:40.584]  Senate back in 1994 to stop the ratification of the Biodiversity Treaty actually talked about the fact that there were human sacrifices as a way of maintaining... By the way, we're not joking!
[01:13:40.644 --> 01:13:41.725]  These are official U.N.
[01:13:41.765 --> 01:13:47.206]  documents that say we can stage wars, old societies and human sacrifice, that's a good idea.
[01:13:47.226 --> 01:13:48.387]  I mean, these are nuts!
[01:13:49.227 --> 01:13:49.887]  They really are.
[01:13:50.387 --> 01:13:51.888]  And they actually have a plan
[01:13:52.406 --> 01:13:57.790]  To reduce the world population from the six and a half, seven billion people now down to one to two billion people.
[01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:58.810]  They say it has to be done.
[01:14:00.419 --> 01:14:05.080]  Those of you who are net consumers and so forth are going to be the ones that go.
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:24.284]  It was very interesting, Alex, when this first came back out in the 1990s, and I was just getting started and I wasn't very well known, I had a chance to talk with the mid-level environmental leadership and so forth at dinners and so on, and I've asked them, why is it that you want this to do, want this to happen, and you don't volunteer yourself up for this on the altar of sacrifice?
[01:14:25.104 --> 01:14:28.765]  And they, to the very person, it was five or six people that I did this to,
[01:14:29.401 --> 01:14:36.383]  And every single one of them looked at me with shock and basically said this, that we need to be around to make sure it gets done right.
[01:14:37.903 --> 01:14:49.526]  Exactly, they're going to have all the resources, they're special, they're going to... These are the sickest filth, and they are so arrogant and waddle around, and I just want to knock their teeth out.
[01:14:49.786 --> 01:14:52.127]  Because, I mean, these are aggressive wannabe killers.
[01:14:52.407 --> 01:14:53.667]  These are wannabe Nazis.
[01:14:53.707 --> 01:14:55.528]  The Nazis were big into environmentalism.
[01:14:56.078 --> 01:14:57.619]  Well, very big into environmentalism.
[01:14:57.659 --> 01:14:59.720]  In fact, they were very much into the occult.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:09.985]  Most people don't realize that because you won't find it in your history books, but if you dig down into some of the original documentation behind Hitler and many of the Nazi leaders, they were very deeply involved in the occult.
[01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:11.566]  Yeah, that's even on mainline TV now.
[01:15:11.606 --> 01:15:19.109]  Going back, particularly the names of those UN documents and charters where they call for the human sacrifice, because I want to... I mean, my memory fell on me.
[01:15:19.129 --> 01:15:20.230]  What's the specific document?
[01:15:21.159 --> 01:15:22.721]  The one that I gave to the U.S.
[01:15:22.741 --> 01:15:26.966]  Senate to stop the ratification of the treaty was called the United Nations Global Adversity Assessment.
[01:15:27.047 --> 01:15:28.008]  That's the one I've got, yeah.
[01:15:28.562 --> 01:15:28.802]  Right.
[01:15:29.282 --> 01:15:30.563]  And I can't remember what page it's in.
[01:15:30.583 --> 01:15:31.663]  I could probably find it again.
[01:15:31.763 --> 01:15:33.744]  It's in Road to Tyranny.
[01:15:33.984 --> 01:15:35.565]  Official UN public stuff.
[01:15:35.585 --> 01:15:36.525]  You can go get it at the library.
[01:15:36.785 --> 01:15:37.626]  I went to the library.
[01:15:37.826 --> 01:15:39.146]  Somebody mailed it to me.
[01:15:39.166 --> 01:15:40.147]  I didn't want to believe it.
[01:15:40.387 --> 01:15:41.107]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:15:41.127 --> 01:15:42.728]  So I went to the little UT library.
[01:15:42.968 --> 01:15:44.208]  And it took like three hours.
[01:15:44.408 --> 01:15:46.189]  And they went back in the stacks and brought it out.
[01:15:46.409 --> 01:15:48.390]  Official UN seals.
[01:15:48.930 --> 01:15:49.210]  Yes.
[01:15:49.611 --> 01:15:50.111]  Absolutely.
[01:15:50.151 --> 01:15:54.032]  And we need to recognize that these people are very serious about what they're doing.
[01:15:54.092 --> 01:15:58.054]  And they think that the only way that they can survive is with them being in control.
[01:15:58.502 --> 01:16:11.815]  And this is what they, there's no intention of the leadership and the climate leadership and so forth for them to take the draconian actions to cut back on their use of carbon and so forth as they're demanding that you and I do.
[01:16:11.955 --> 01:16:15.499]  And that's right in this DVD that we're going to be talking about here in the next 45 minutes.
[01:16:16.039 --> 01:16:21.264]  That these people have no intention of ever doing any of the things they're demanding us to do.
[01:16:22.105 --> 01:16:22.846]  They already lead us.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.101]  Let's just get into it right now.
[01:16:26.121 --> 01:16:27.983]  We covered this last week, but it's so important.
[01:16:28.003 --> 01:16:30.525]  People hear, oh my gosh, greenhouse gases, they're going to kill us.
[01:16:30.905 --> 01:16:37.532]  But it's the ultimate joke, because carbon dioxide is one of the two keys to all life on this planet.
[01:16:37.552 --> 01:16:38.312]  Can you break that down?
[01:16:38.933 --> 01:16:39.533]  Absolutely.
[01:16:39.593 --> 01:16:42.376]  In fact, it's really a miracle gas when you get down to it.
[01:16:42.416 --> 01:16:45.779]  The more carbon dioxide that we have, the better plants grow.
[01:16:45.879 --> 01:16:49.763]  Trees, shrubs, flowers, and food crops.
[01:16:50.473 --> 01:16:52.533]  It's been a proven fact now.
[01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:53.734]  They'll try to deny it.
[01:16:53.754 --> 01:17:00.335]  They'll try to throw out research that denies it and so forth, but it's always... Also, photoplankton, that's the key to the entire food chain in the ocean.
[01:17:00.835 --> 01:17:01.415]  That's correct.
[01:17:01.716 --> 01:17:02.256]  Absolutely.
[01:17:03.156 --> 01:17:13.358]  And the carbon dioxide, if you double the carbon dioxide, as they're predicting to happen in the next 90 years or so, you will actually increase food production by 20 to 50 percent.
[01:17:14.278 --> 01:17:16.899]  It is a major, major benefit
[01:17:17.645 --> 01:17:17.945]  Thank you.
[01:17:33.303 --> 01:17:36.244]  In order to increase food product, but they don't want that.
[01:17:36.665 --> 01:17:37.925]  They want people to starve.
[01:17:38.265 --> 01:17:56.794]  And this is, it is ironic that in this particular global biodiversity assessment, this United Nations document, it actually says that we have, we have to reduce the amount of fertilization, we have to reduce the amount of biogenetics materials and so forth, because it hurts planet Earth.
[01:17:57.358 --> 01:18:03.753]  And therefore, and they admit right in their document that if they did that it would reduce the food production by at least one half.
[01:18:05.613 --> 01:18:08.815]  That's an incredible statement there.
[01:18:08.875 --> 01:18:10.636]  Let's come back and get more of that after break.
[01:18:10.656 --> 01:18:15.258]  And also, some of the studies I've seen about gas loss into space.
[01:18:15.479 --> 01:18:29.546]  We know that the gravity pull holds much of the atmosphere in, but we know that, as with Mars, it lost its atmosphere, and that the Earth does lose atmosphere every minute, and that actually it is life forms here regenerating,
[01:18:30.186 --> 01:18:34.408]  Greenhouse gases that continue to bolster our atmosphere.
[01:18:34.729 --> 01:18:41.712]  And so I want to understand this tax on life and a literal tax on the planet's life force.
[01:18:42.253 --> 01:18:47.555]  That living sheet, that living ribbon of life that's on the surface and in the atmosphere.
[01:18:47.835 --> 01:18:50.517]  We'll be right back with Dr. Michael Kaufman on the other side.
[01:18:55.214 --> 01:18:59.719]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:19:00.039 --> 01:19:04.143]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:19:04.423 --> 01:19:04.984]  We listened.
[01:19:05.284 --> 01:19:10.269]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:19:10.549 --> 01:19:11.050]  We listened.
[01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:14.473]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:14.894 --> 01:19:15.434]  We listened.
[01:19:15.895 --> 01:19:19.238]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:19:19.278 --> 01:19:19.838]  We're good to go.
[01:19:36.304 --> 01:19:38.945]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.
[01:19:39.145 --> 01:19:39.325]  Only $279.

[01:20:08.963 --> 01:20:10.005]  Erosion accelerates.
[01:20:10.085 --> 01:20:17.474]  Mainline talk show hosts are trying to hold on to their support of the conservative movement, keeping focus on the Republican agenda and playing into the hand of the globalists.
[01:20:17.614 --> 01:20:21.018]  Dr. Corsi interviewed Robert Pastor of the American University.
[01:20:21.179 --> 01:20:27.747]  With the slight of hand and incremental implementation, Pastor admits to the North American Union as being forced upon us.
[01:20:28.187 --> 01:20:32.850]  Corsi uncovers the CFR's plan to build a North American community similar to the EU.
[01:20:33.191 --> 01:20:38.374]  In his report, the North American Union isn't going away, Corsi exposes the deception and trickery.

[01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:55.770]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.431 --> 01:21:04.497]  Did you know that Senate committee investigations in the 1960s called the international communist movement the greatest conspiracy the world has ever witnessed?
[01:21:05.398 --> 01:21:12.724]  They said the communists had infiltrated into high government offices in the State Department and also advisors to presidents.
[01:21:13.576 --> 01:21:21.703]  Did you know that the Communist infiltration successfully stopped all FBI investigations into their secret activities?
[01:21:21.803 --> 01:21:29.830]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[01:21:51.738 --> 01:21:53.700]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:57.003]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:21:57.283 --> 01:22:02.068]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:22:02.368 --> 01:22:05.111]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:22:05.371 --> 01:22:10.036]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[01:22:10.316 --> 01:22:12.238]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:22:12.698 --> 01:22:22.645]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[01:22:23.025 --> 01:22:27.708]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:22:28.088 --> 01:22:31.610]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:22:31.831 --> 01:22:33.992]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[01:22:34.292 --> 01:22:38.415]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll even refund the shipping charge.
[01:22:38.735 --> 01:22:40.276]  Share the oil company's secret.
[01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:41.839]  And get SFR now!
[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:42.962]  What are you waiting for?
[01:22:43.122 --> 01:22:43.824]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[01:22:44.044 --> 01:22:44.245]  That's 1-888-873-7371.
[01:22:44.265 --> 01:22:44.425]  Today!
[01:23:19.954 --> 01:23:21.495]  Dr. Michael Kaufman is our guest.
[01:23:21.535 --> 01:23:28.140]  The film Global Warming or Global Governance available at InfoWars.com right now by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:33.245]  It is powerful and it's very simple the way he lays it out.
[01:23:33.945 --> 01:23:36.407]  Lay it out for us, but before you do that let's get into
[01:23:37.882 --> 01:23:40.183]  Well, we're talking about cutting food production by half.
[01:23:40.283 --> 01:23:43.524]  That is going to get rid of at least 20-30% of the population.
[01:23:43.845 --> 01:23:48.306]  We already have millions starving to death a year, conservatively, Dr. Kaufman.
[01:23:48.366 --> 01:23:58.531]  And then on top of that, the scientists say we need the life forms, plants and animals producing more gas, because aren't we losing and leaching gas into space?
[01:23:59.191 --> 01:23:59.711]  Yes, we are.
[01:24:00.231 --> 01:24:06.174]  On a very constant basis, as you indicated before the break, Mars has basically lost its atmosphere.
[01:24:06.966 --> 01:24:07.706]  For two reasons.
[01:24:07.766 --> 01:24:09.967]  First of all, it doesn't have the gravitational pull.
[01:24:10.427 --> 01:24:15.388]  But secondly, it did not have any life forms on it to replenish that gas and to keep it going.
[01:24:16.088 --> 01:24:23.631]  And as a consequence, it has lost its atmosphere, while the Earth still has an atmosphere, a lot of oceans, a lot of water.
[01:24:23.711 --> 01:24:29.012]  Water vapor makes the atmosphere heavier, and it helps keep things down, as it were.
[01:24:29.608 --> 01:24:35.253]  But otherwise, we would start losing a lot of these gases and it would become more and more difficult for life here on Earth.
[01:24:35.453 --> 01:24:45.201]  But the big studies I've seen show that compared to 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago, that we're actually in an oxygen and carbon dioxide starved level.
[01:24:45.321 --> 01:24:45.541]  Yes.
[01:24:45.801 --> 01:24:49.404]  Why would the elite want to block the blooming of key gases?
[01:24:50.065 --> 01:24:55.489]  You know, I make that very point in the DVD, is that carbon dioxide is almost a miracle gas.
[01:24:55.976 --> 01:25:06.721]  We can go up to five or six times the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, and it would only provide better health to our environment, and better health to our plants, and better crops, and so forth.
[01:25:07.081 --> 01:25:07.922]  More food production.
[01:25:07.982 --> 01:25:10.063]  Everything else is... It's a positive.
[01:25:10.083 --> 01:25:11.363]  There are almost no negatives.
[01:25:11.403 --> 01:25:14.245]  Instead, we've had a tiny fractional increase.
[01:25:14.265 --> 01:25:14.545]  This is...
[01:25:16.119 --> 01:25:22.461]  A fractional increase and it's meaningless, but yet they have spent over 50 billion dollars.
[01:25:23.361 --> 01:25:33.144]  50 billion dollars since 1989 trying to make this link between mankind and carbon dioxide and so forth and global warming.
[01:25:33.304 --> 01:25:34.584]  They have not been successful.
[01:25:34.984 --> 01:25:41.606]  You look at most scientists, they will basically say that the link is between man-made carbon dioxide and so forth and
[01:25:42.316 --> 01:25:44.178]  Global warming is very tenuous at best.
[01:25:44.658 --> 01:25:59.131]  Less than half of the scientists, contrary to what you hear by Al Gore and everybody else, less than half of the scientists that have any knowledge about what's going on at all will tell you that we do not know enough about global warming to be creating policy.
[01:25:59.631 --> 01:26:08.699]  Most of those people that are on the other side of the fence believe it's a natural cycle, and this is what's irritating to those people who have really looked at the science hard.
[01:26:09.446 --> 01:26:19.912]  is that if you go back 450 to 600,000 years, just like Al Gore did in his big 30-foot screen in his Inconvenient Truth, you will see carbon dioxide and temperature.
[01:26:20.252 --> 01:26:28.697]  You will not see them superimposed, but you will see them one under the other, basically making the claim that there is a high correlation.
[01:26:29.097 --> 01:26:33.539]  Well, there is a high correlation, but that does not necessarily mean cause and effect.
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:35.500]  I can tell you right now with 100% certainty
[01:26:37.139 --> 01:26:40.862]  That there's a 100% correlation that every person who breathes air is going to die.
[01:26:41.943 --> 01:26:42.143]  Right?
[01:26:42.464 --> 01:26:42.704]  Yes.
[01:26:42.744 --> 01:26:43.765]  Think about it for a second.
[01:26:44.385 --> 01:26:46.027]  Every person that breathes air is going to die.
[01:26:46.247 --> 01:26:48.929]  Eventually, in 60 or 70 or 80 years, we're going to die.
[01:26:49.530 --> 01:26:50.250]  And we breathe air.
[01:26:50.650 --> 01:26:52.192]  That's a 100% correlation.
[01:26:52.752 --> 01:26:54.774]  However, that doesn't mean there's a cause and effect.
[01:26:54.994 --> 01:27:00.599]  Because you all know, as well as I do, that if we didn't breathe air for more than 10 minutes, we would be dead right away.
[01:27:01.112 --> 01:27:02.954]  So, there is no cause and effect.
[01:27:02.974 --> 01:27:05.658]  Just because there is a correlation doesn't mean there's a cause and effect.
[01:27:05.678 --> 01:27:06.359]  Well, let's be clear.
[01:27:06.479 --> 01:27:19.675]  I mean, they just had the big global warming swindle documentary, and many others with top climatologist scientists, top ice scientists, top planetary scientists, sun scientists, you know, all the experts out there who study these things.
[01:27:19.975 --> 01:27:24.338]  And all the disciplines agree, which is very rare, that there is a cause and effect.
[01:27:24.458 --> 01:27:31.642]  Things heat up, there's a life bloom, and within 600 years, you see an increase in carbon dioxide output.
[01:27:31.662 --> 01:27:32.203]  Exactly.
[01:27:32.343 --> 01:27:35.585]  And so that's the correlation, is that heat causes more life.
[01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:37.338]  That's exactly right.
[01:27:37.398 --> 01:27:45.703]  And what we see when you do this analysis and actually superimpose these two graphs, the United Nations doesn't superimpose them, Al Gore doesn't superimpose them.
[01:27:46.143 --> 01:27:46.423]  Why?
[01:27:46.523 --> 01:27:53.528]  Because if you superimpose them, you would immediately see that carbon dioxide changes occur after the temperature changes.
[01:27:54.028 --> 01:27:56.429]  And it's for primarily two different reasons.
[01:27:56.449 --> 01:28:03.494]  One of them, as you just described, you have more growth, we'll have more plants and so forth, and you're emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
[01:28:04.014 --> 01:28:06.996]  But as much as anything is, that the ocean begins to warm.
[01:28:07.396 --> 01:28:09.998]  And the ocean is a huge carbon dioxide sink.
[01:28:10.338 --> 01:28:14.060]  And the warmer it becomes, the less carbon dioxide it can hold.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.823]  And it actually causes a release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as it warms up.
[01:28:19.023 --> 01:28:26.708]  Which then accelerates the photoblankton, it accelerates the entire chain, and you have a huge lifebloom.
[01:28:27.028 --> 01:28:28.369]  Oh my gosh, isn't that horrible?
[01:28:29.205 --> 01:28:30.967]  It's the summertime for the planet, folks.
[01:28:31.027 --> 01:28:32.048]  It's good.
[01:28:32.728 --> 01:28:35.150]  But no, we need a global tax to counter that.
[01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:36.591]  Stay with us, Dr. Kaufman.
[01:28:37.012 --> 01:28:42.356]  By the way, folks, you can comment right now on the message board for questions of Dr. Kaufman, and I'll ask him the questions on air.

[01:29:58.155 --> 01:30:02.118]  Providing for our own food, water and power are a good start.

[01:30:53.331 --> 01:30:53.852]  Hey Emily!
[01:30:54.152 --> 01:30:54.994]  Wow, you look great!
[01:30:55.672 --> 01:30:56.473]  I feel great.
[01:30:56.713 --> 01:30:58.614]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:30:59.035 --> 01:30:59.335]  Really?
[01:30:59.535 --> 01:30:59.975]  What is it?
[01:31:00.115 --> 01:31:00.576]  How does it work?
[01:31:00.696 --> 01:31:07.661]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[01:31:07.961 --> 01:31:10.223]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:31:10.623 --> 01:31:15.727]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:31:16.247 --> 01:31:16.728]  That's it?
[01:31:17.028 --> 01:31:18.549]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:31:18.849 --> 01:31:19.570]  It is easy.
[01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:26.515]  Plus, the FDA says Flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:31:26.775 --> 01:31:28.116]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:29.097]  That's amazing!
[01:31:29.437 --> 01:31:34.781]  And, the Benzonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:31:35.042 --> 01:31:35.342]  Wow!
[01:31:35.522 --> 01:31:36.603]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[01:31:37.043 --> 01:31:40.045]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[01:31:40.146 --> 01:31:44.029]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[01:31:44.249 --> 01:31:44.709]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[01:31:44.769 --> 01:31:44.989]  That's 800-317-9547.
[01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.650]  Yeah.
[01:32:37.131 --> 01:32:38.632]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:39.453 --> 01:32:40.713]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:32:40.834 --> 01:32:45.156]  Dr. Michael Kaufman is our guest for the new film, Global Warming or Global Governance.
[01:32:49.459 --> 01:32:51.781]  I'm looking here at the message board, comments, questions.
[01:32:51.801 --> 01:32:55.183]  It says, Alex, take it easy on me and other soldiers.
[01:32:56.004 --> 01:33:02.408]  When I talk about soldiers with ADIQs that will confiscate guns and do things, I'm talking about the bad ones.
[01:33:03.482 --> 01:33:07.524]  That they've lowered standards and they're admittedly recruiting people with criminal records, gang members.
[01:33:07.924 --> 01:33:08.985]  I should be clear on that.
[01:33:09.905 --> 01:33:13.047]  But no, we support good constitutional military.
[01:33:13.707 --> 01:33:20.611]  And we support not feeding the troops into meat grinders over there by design that are only meant to demonize the United States and bring in the one world government.
[01:33:20.791 --> 01:33:22.072]  It's all part of a larger plan.
[01:33:22.572 --> 01:33:25.754]  We'll be taking questions for Dr. Michael Kaufman there on the message board.
[01:33:26.254 --> 01:33:32.337]  If you go to forum.prisonplanet.com it says live questions for Alex Jones, live show forum.
[01:33:33.052 --> 01:33:35.994]  And later, in the last 30 minutes of the show today, I'm going to go through some of the other questions.
[01:33:36.014 --> 01:33:36.914]  There's hundreds a day there.
[01:33:36.934 --> 01:33:37.835]  I can only cover a few of them.
[01:33:38.095 --> 01:33:43.898]  But the good thing is, when you ask those questions there on the site, then there's a lot of really smart people listening to this show.
[01:33:44.439 --> 01:33:45.960]  And you get all sorts of interesting answers.
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:48.181]  Some of them are right, some of them are wrong, some of them are part right.
[01:33:48.621 --> 01:33:52.343]  There's big discussions there, and I really like all the activity going on.
[01:33:52.363 --> 01:33:56.786]  I think there's like 15-something thousand posts now in the forum.
[01:33:57.506 --> 01:34:01.967]  And we're really excited about that and glad that people are using it there.
[01:34:02.467 --> 01:34:05.908]  Dr. Michael Coffman, please continue with the line that you were going over there.
[01:34:06.668 --> 01:34:13.230]  Well, we were talking about carbon dioxide and temperatures and the fact that carbon dioxide always follows temperatures by a few hundred years.
[01:34:13.810 --> 01:34:17.671]  In almost every case, if you go back to 450 to 600,000 years and Al Gore goes back, the United Nations goes back,
[01:34:20.451 --> 01:34:23.014]  And if you superimpose this, you will see this very literally.
[01:34:23.034 --> 01:34:25.195]  And I talk about this in the actual video.
[01:34:25.716 --> 01:34:32.822]  And the realization that carbon dioxide has never driven temperature, the Earth's temperature, has always been the reverse.
[01:34:33.523 --> 01:34:37.106]  But you don't hear about that in your evening news or in the newspapers.
[01:34:37.266 --> 01:34:43.932]  Always this hysteria that carbon dioxide is causing global warming and we must do something about it.
[01:34:44.426 --> 01:34:53.870]  Well folks, the way they want to do something about it is to impose a supranational organization over the top of us that will basically control all carbon emissions.
[01:34:53.950 --> 01:35:01.654]  And as we've talked about, and you have mentioned a couple times, that carbon dioxide is the lifeblood of this planet.
[01:35:01.794 --> 01:35:04.055]  And if they control that, they control everything.
[01:35:04.255 --> 01:35:04.675]  Literally.
[01:35:04.835 --> 01:35:06.316]  Our economy, everything else.
[01:35:07.136 --> 01:35:08.617]  And that's why they're so desperate.
[01:35:09.167 --> 01:35:15.070]  They are so desperate in trying to convince you that unless we control this carbon dioxide, we're all going to die.
[01:35:16.770 --> 01:35:21.212]  And then they can literally, in fact even Mainline, the New York Times called it a tax on breathing.
[01:35:21.472 --> 01:35:22.873]  This is literally what it is!
[01:35:23.613 --> 01:35:24.374]  It really is.
[01:35:24.954 --> 01:35:36.899]  And you know, you can take this to the extreme, and I doubt that this is going to happen because it would really start stirring people up, is that by your life, by your living and so forth, you are a pollutant causer.
[01:35:37.543 --> 01:35:42.948]  And as a consequence, you could be taxed, you could be held in the... Well, actually, that's what they're saying.
[01:35:42.988 --> 01:35:49.214]  They have said that first we're going to get taxes on carbon emitters like cars, lawnmowers, airplanes.
[01:35:49.815 --> 01:35:53.799]  But they've now announced in US and British papers, Fox News endorsed it.
[01:35:53.859 --> 01:35:59.665]  Fox News said children are bad, having more than one or two is bad, and there should be a tax on having children.
[01:36:00.545 --> 01:36:12.173]  In 1975, the one-child policy started as a tax on more than one child, and then in 1981, it became, under IMF and World Bank agreements, George Bush, Sr., by the way, as ambassador to China, pioneered this.
[01:36:12.593 --> 01:36:21.799]  It's in State Department Memorandum 200, 2000, excuse me, where they come in with this whole plan, and that's what the Chinese model is.
[01:36:22.019 --> 01:36:24.640]  So at first, they just call it a tax on more than one child.
[01:36:24.881 --> 01:36:26.221]  This is the one-child policy.
[01:36:26.402 --> 01:36:27.002]  They're doing it!
[01:36:28.163 --> 01:36:28.944]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:36:29.384 --> 01:36:37.509]  But what I'm really concerned about is if they don't like you, I mean, it could eventually come to this, I doubt that it will, but if they don't like you, they can hold you for criminal activities because you breathe.
[01:36:38.029 --> 01:36:38.410]  Literally.
[01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:43.233]  Because they're very close to declaring carbon dioxide a pollutant.
[01:36:43.733 --> 01:36:46.595]  If they declare the polar bear endangered,
[01:36:47.389 --> 01:36:52.331]  Well, they have a Penn & Teller piece, and Penn & Teller can lie about 9-11 and a few other issues, but they tell the truth.
[01:37:06.937 --> 01:37:09.139]  Let's play a minute or two of that if you can find it, John.
[01:37:18.554 --> 01:37:23.676]  They go out and they give the scientific term for water, and they say, shouldn't we ban that?
[01:37:24.056 --> 01:37:25.437]  And everybody says, ban it.
[01:37:25.457 --> 01:37:26.798]  Yeah, ban it right now.
[01:37:27.218 --> 01:37:29.559]  I mean, that shows the ignorance of the public.
[01:37:29.939 --> 01:37:37.302]  I'm sure you heard about Miss Teen USA from South Carolina being asked, why can't one-fifth of Americans find the U.S.
[01:37:37.342 --> 01:37:38.862]  on a map, and she couldn't even talk.
[01:37:38.882 --> 01:37:39.723]  She just babbled.
[01:37:39.923 --> 01:37:42.644]  I mean, they have really dumbed people down by design.
[01:37:43.354 --> 01:38:01.322]  Yes, they have, and of course that goes right back to their educational policy back in the 1920s, even the 1910s, to our deliberate attempt to begin to dumb down our educational system so that we have nothing but people who they can pour information into, have nothing to do with education, and have everything to do with indoctrination.
[01:38:03.524 --> 01:38:07.830]  Dr. Kaufman, there's a question here, and I never brought this up to you.
[01:38:07.870 --> 01:38:09.512]  They say, what about chemtrails?
[01:38:09.552 --> 01:38:14.399]  Now, we know that some people think every condensation trail is some secret chemical trail.
[01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:21.615]  But clearly there have been thousands of declassified admissions of high-altitude, low-altitude spraying, weather modification.
[01:38:21.635 --> 01:38:32.523]  I've had the father of weather weapons, a meteorologist, Ben Livingston on, who got Stanford Research Labs in 1966 to certify that they can control hurricanes, create them, or kill them, or weaken them.
[01:38:33.284 --> 01:38:37.547]  We know there have been newscasts where the government has admitted, okay, we're doing a secret program.
[01:38:37.888 --> 01:38:43.252]  Textbooks are now saying there's a secret program to, quote, spray the sky as a sunscreen to keep us safe.
[01:38:43.652 --> 01:38:44.613]  I mean, have you looked into that?
[01:38:45.738 --> 01:38:47.819]  Yeah, I've only basically looked into it.
[01:38:48.039 --> 01:38:49.159]  I really have not studied it.
[01:38:49.479 --> 01:38:51.780]  I really don't have the qualifications to address that issue.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:59.123]  I am very concerned about it, but there's unfortunately only a limited amount that one person could do at a time, so I'm not the right person to ask.
[01:39:01.014 --> 01:39:01.594]  Absolutely.
[01:39:01.655 --> 01:39:03.676]  I mean, these things were all so specific.
[01:39:03.996 --> 01:39:10.940]  All I know is, in 1996 and before, a jet trail would normally form in the winter or fall.
[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:12.801]  It would form above 20,000 feet.
[01:39:12.861 --> 01:39:14.142]  It would disappear in a minute or so.
[01:39:14.622 --> 01:39:23.308]  Now, I can sit out in the backyard in the middle of a summer day and watch trails at 5,000 feet, and I just don't know why they stay there for five hours.
[01:39:24.148 --> 01:39:25.489]  Right, it's a long time.
[01:39:25.970 --> 01:39:28.292]  I think it's something that needs to be investigated.
[01:39:28.372 --> 01:39:31.495]  I'm very concerned about it, but I just don't have the knowledge to be able to address it.
[01:39:31.655 --> 01:39:32.896]  Well, I mean, nobody really knows.
[01:39:34.257 --> 01:39:39.662]  It's really a mystery wrapped in an enigma, so we do need to investigate that.
[01:39:42.145 --> 01:39:51.889]  Think about what they're also going to do with all this global taxation power, with the trillions of dollars, and they say it would be trillions a year, that they would raise with this.
[01:39:52.229 --> 01:39:55.650]  What is the United Nations saying from your research that they're going to do with all this money?
[01:39:56.230 --> 01:40:02.913]  Well, basically, they would be able to tighten down and be able to administer their treaties that they're called upon to do.
[01:40:03.513 --> 01:40:07.094]  And to do it, they need to set up a huge international bureaucracy.
[01:40:07.134 --> 01:40:08.555]  In fact, the European Union
[01:40:09.051 --> 01:40:15.194]  is attempting to get a environmental protection group together at the international level.
[01:40:15.554 --> 01:40:29.361]  It's been discussed since the mid-1990s to put in the United Nations and that would then be like the EPA, except it would be over the entire world and you and I would be responsible to it, but we would have no input whatsoever into its activities.
[01:40:29.742 --> 01:40:35.484]  In other words, whatever the globalists decide to do, that's what you and I have to do and we have nothing to say about it.
[01:40:35.564 --> 01:40:35.945]  We can't.
[01:40:36.045 --> 01:40:37.245]  There's no way of redress.
[01:40:37.946 --> 01:40:38.486]  Nothing else.
[01:40:39.019 --> 01:40:56.390]  And this is what they want these trillions of dollars for, is to have this huge international environmental bureaucracy, social bureaucracy, financial bureaucracy, you name it, it's across every single segment of our society, and they want to have control over it with this international bureaucracy.
[01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:57.431]  It is horrendous.
[01:40:58.529 --> 01:41:09.475]  One thing, and I don't support him on a lot of things, but one thing I do support President Bush on is he refused the global tax back in 2002 at the Monterey Conference.
[01:41:09.715 --> 01:41:14.277]  But that's because he had to because of conservative and libertarian and scientific pressure here.
[01:41:15.678 --> 01:41:22.220]  A week before he announced it, Jim Tucker got info out of Bilderberg, 2007, that Bush was about to reverse himself.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:31.603]  He announced on this show he would reverse himself and say he was for a global carbon tax, and now Bush has announced it just on time, and now they're pushing forward.
[01:41:32.283 --> 01:41:32.844]  Yeah, I know.
[01:41:32.864 --> 01:41:40.646]  What we're seeing here is that if it doesn't work this year, they're going to try it, they'll put it in a different language or something like that, try it next year or the year after.
[01:41:41.486 --> 01:41:43.227]  These people have literally
[01:41:43.746 --> 01:41:48.168]  Hundreds of billions of dollars to spend on implementing their agenda.
[01:41:48.608 --> 01:41:50.549]  Most of it's taxpayer money, believe it or not.
[01:41:51.009 --> 01:41:52.270]  Most of it, you're supporting.
[01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:54.811]  You're supporting your own demise through your tax dollars.
[01:41:55.591 --> 01:41:59.473]  And what they're doing is, if it doesn't work this year, they're going to try it next year.
[01:42:01.234 --> 01:42:05.275]  It will keep coming back and keep coming back and keep coming back until they get what they want.
[01:42:05.816 --> 01:42:13.319]  They will, in the meantime, try to create this, like they're doing with this global warming thing, some sort of catastrophe to convince you that you have to do it.
[01:42:13.911 --> 01:42:22.395]  This Hegelian dialectic concept that they will then use to be able to move you off of where you are right now into where they want you to be.
[01:42:25.417 --> 01:42:26.337]  How do we stop them?
[01:42:26.777 --> 01:42:28.518]  I mean, what's your take?
[01:42:29.859 --> 01:42:33.241]  From studying this, what have you seen that's effective to expose these people?
[01:42:33.561 --> 01:42:35.082]  How do you see this fight playing out?
[01:42:35.882 --> 01:42:42.005]  Well, you know, there's a number of directions, and I want to hit just on this global warming one for an example.
[01:42:42.799 --> 01:42:46.800]  One of the reasons I did this global warming one, and it is a very powerful DVD.
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:48.640]  I'm not in it very much.
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:57.442]  Most of it are scientists and politicians and experts and so forth that I have interviewed or had somebody else interview that gave me the footage.
[01:42:58.102 --> 01:43:06.544]  And in that, it describes exactly what is causing this warming and what is not causing this warming and is not man that's causing this warming.
[01:43:07.345 --> 01:43:07.685]  I think so.
[01:43:19.833 --> 01:43:22.214]  That goes into determining what your climate is.
[01:43:22.234 --> 01:43:42.926]  Well, just last week, the computer models were, they had like 15 different ones at the NOAA website and the Hurricane Center, and out of 15 models, most of them had it hitting northern Mexico or south Texas, and only one model had it, well actually, one of the models got kind of close to where it actually went through Yucatan and then into southern Mexico.
[01:43:43.186 --> 01:43:46.888]  So even, I mean, 15 computer models, one of them was halfway right.
[01:43:47.549 --> 01:43:48.009]  That's right.
[01:43:48.129 --> 01:43:50.770]  And if you take that as an example, you know about their accuracy.
[01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:51.730]  I'm glad we have them.
[01:43:52.651 --> 01:43:54.371]  You know, I do think that they have value.
[01:43:54.471 --> 01:44:00.573]  Oh yeah, they're a lot better than a hundred years ago, not knowing a hurricane was coming in and it kills 20,000 people in Galveston.
[01:44:01.033 --> 01:44:01.994]  That's exactly right.
[01:44:02.054 --> 01:44:03.454]  I mean, they do have their advantages.
[01:44:03.514 --> 01:44:06.195]  However, they cannot be used for policy formulation.
[01:44:06.235 --> 01:44:09.676]  And by the way, nine times out of ten, those models are way off.
[01:44:10.036 --> 01:44:15.198]  And that's just dealing with one issue like a hurricane, not to mention the global interactions.
[01:44:16.274 --> 01:44:24.801]  And speaking of hurricanes, there's all this clamor going on with hurricanes, that carbon dioxide in global warming is causing hurricanes.
[01:44:25.101 --> 01:44:25.862]  That's bull.
[01:44:26.262 --> 01:44:28.223]  I can say that straight out.
[01:44:28.684 --> 01:44:32.767]  I mean, I want you to be able to talk about that, but I mean, just piggybacking on that now before I forget.
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:42.388]  I mean, now, if there's a puddle, they act like... I mean, now the people calling me in Austin are saying, are we all dead if Noah's Ark been built because we had a bunch of rainfall?
[01:44:42.468 --> 01:44:42.809]  No!
[01:44:43.469 --> 01:44:46.792]  I mean, they act like everything's the end of the world, every tornado's the end of the world.
[01:44:47.233 --> 01:44:48.474]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:44:49.415 --> 01:44:55.821]  You're absolutely right, and if you go back in history, you're going to find these kinds of events, droughts, floods, and so forth, all scattered throughout U.S.
[01:44:55.841 --> 01:44:57.262]  history for the last 200 years.
[01:44:57.282 --> 01:44:57.963]  There's nothing new.
[01:44:58.838 --> 01:45:00.839]  These things do happen on a periodic basis.
[01:45:00.859 --> 01:45:08.623]  Well, 80 years ago, the Mississippi killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed, you know, from the top to bottom, all the cities around it.
[01:45:09.223 --> 01:45:09.464]  Yes.
[01:45:09.924 --> 01:45:10.184]  Yes.
[01:45:10.864 --> 01:45:19.529]  But to continue on with hurricanes, what we're seeing here is really a recurrence of what happened back in the 1930s, 40s, and early 50s.
[01:45:20.009 --> 01:45:24.951]  There were a lot more hurricanes in those three decades than there were in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and early 90s.
[01:45:27.004 --> 01:45:31.185]  We have been going through a very dormant period of hurricanes, and now we're coming back to normal.
[01:45:31.486 --> 01:45:32.946]  So what's all the excitement about?
[01:45:32.966 --> 01:45:45.310]  In addition, all your hurricane scientists, I think every single one of them, will tell you that global warming cannot, cannot, cannot cause an increase in hurricanes.
[01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:46.990]  And there's a very simple reason for this.
[01:45:47.470 --> 01:45:52.192]  Yes, your ocean temperature is warm, and that's a very key factor in hurricane formation and strength.
[01:45:52.774 --> 01:46:07.780]  However, according to the carbon dioxide theory, and I described this very clearly in the DVD, according to the carbon dioxide theory, at the mid-levels of the troposphere, that's where carbon dioxide is supposed to be accumulating and causing the heat trapping.
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:14.223]  So the upper, the mid-part of the troposphere is supposed to warm faster than the surface of the Earth.
[01:46:14.801 --> 01:46:22.212]  Well, you have to have a strong temperature gradient between the surface or the ocean and the upper atmosphere in order to cause a hurricane.
[01:46:22.612 --> 01:46:26.538]  And what you're seeing here, according to the theory of carbon dioxide global warming,
[01:46:27.071 --> 01:46:28.552]  That's right, and according to global warming models,
[01:46:48.035 --> 01:46:50.701]  All of these temperature gradients are diminished.
[01:46:50.741 --> 01:46:51.703]  They're not increased.
[01:46:51.763 --> 01:46:56.773]  And so you're going to have fewer storms and fewer hurricanes and so forth and so on.
[01:46:56.853 --> 01:46:57.394]  Not more.
[01:46:57.595 --> 01:46:59.278]  We've actually been having milder winters.
[01:47:00.111 --> 01:47:00.692]  Yes, we have.
[01:47:00.792 --> 01:47:01.352]  Isn't that nice?
[01:47:01.733 --> 01:47:02.613]  And milder summers.
[01:47:02.633 --> 01:47:05.316]  And I go back and look at the numbers, they'll lie and call it the biggest drought ever.
[01:47:05.336 --> 01:47:09.860]  And you go back and look and it was a 10 year one in the 50s or in the 1830s it was even worse.
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:15.626]  I mean, it's just endless lying and endless twisting and just unbelievable propaganda.
[01:47:15.646 --> 01:47:17.007]  I have a question for you.
[01:47:17.728 --> 01:47:22.412]  Have you ever seen the 1989 film, Global Warming film, After the Warming?
[01:47:23.673 --> 01:47:24.334]  No, I have not.
[01:47:25.291 --> 01:47:29.852]  I know I've seen films that were made back in the 70s where they claimed we were going to be in an ice age by now.
[01:47:29.992 --> 01:47:30.192]  Right.
[01:47:30.952 --> 01:47:31.393]  That's right.
[01:47:32.273 --> 01:47:33.913]  And that's of course in the DVD as well.
[01:47:33.933 --> 01:47:38.734]  I've talked about all the propaganda and so forth trying to tell us that we were having a mixed ice age.
[01:47:39.314 --> 01:47:45.816]  And it's the same group of people, the very same group of people back in the 1990s that were saying that we're going to have global warming.
[01:47:46.323 --> 01:47:48.464]  It's an agenda, folks.
[01:47:48.705 --> 01:47:51.046]  We're having global warming, but it's all natural.
[01:47:51.206 --> 01:47:55.289]  It has nothing to do with man or man's activities.
[01:47:55.529 --> 01:47:56.350]  Here's another question.
[01:47:56.890 --> 01:47:59.932]  Was the IPCC conference scientific or political?
[01:48:00.552 --> 01:48:01.653]  It was totally political.
[01:48:01.673 --> 01:48:02.013]  100% political.
[01:48:03.672 --> 01:48:10.820]  The scientists that were writing those, and this of course is explained in the DVD I think very well, the scientists really didn't have any choice in the matter.
[01:48:11.141 --> 01:48:17.267]  The actual summary for policy makers that you read in your newspapers and the evening news and so forth were written by politicians.
[01:48:17.288 --> 01:48:18.549]  They were written by bureaucrats.
[01:48:19.128 --> 01:48:25.310]  And they were actually telling the scientists what they had to say in order to support their summary for policymakers.
[01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:32.712]  Now, for those out there listening, say, on 1330 AM that just turned us on in Central Texas, and they're going, what are you talking about?
[01:48:32.732 --> 01:48:41.114]  They claim that 2,000-plus global scientists have signed onto a paper saying global warming is man-made, it's going to kill us all if we don't have a world tax.
[01:48:41.754 --> 01:48:47.597]  Now, hundreds of those scientists have said, I wasn't even addressed, I wasn't even called, my name was just added.
[01:48:47.957 --> 01:48:52.499]  Others who were there said, I didn't agree, I just went to a meeting, and it turns out the U.N.
[01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:54.439]  just wrote that up and the whole thing's a fraud.
[01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:56.120]  Yeah, the whole thing's a fraud.
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:09.325]  In fact, the United Nations, for the very first time, and I don't know if it was political pressure or what, just this last week released all of the comments on this last set of comments, commentary and so forth, that just came out this past year.
[01:49:11.087 --> 01:49:15.352]  More than half of the comments were negative against what the United Nations was saying.
[01:49:16.012 --> 01:49:27.625]  And, of course, Al Gore says there was 100% unanimity that all these scientists were proclaiming that man is causing global warming, when over half were saying that these statements were not correct.
[01:49:28.906 --> 01:49:32.951]  Stay there with us in this next segment, and maybe one more, then we're going to get
[01:49:33.675 --> 01:49:42.741]  Heidi Ahn, the wife and mother of Aaron's children, his widow, joining us coming up in the next hour.
[01:49:42.761 --> 01:49:44.602]  Then key financial news in the last 30 minutes.
[01:49:44.923 --> 01:49:45.323]  Stay with us.
[01:49:56.286 --> 01:50:01.771]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.131 --> 01:50:09.778]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.464 --> 01:50:17.528]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.928 --> 01:50:29.354]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.654 --> 01:50:33.176]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.617 --> 01:50:35.578]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.878 --> 01:50:39.660]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.192 --> 01:50:58.415]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.575 --> 01:51:06.660]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:13.964]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.144 --> 01:51:15.444]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:15.504 --> 01:51:21.405]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.585 --> 01:51:26.686]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.786 --> 01:51:35.668]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:35.928 --> 01:51:39.229]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:51:52.758 --> 01:51:53.178]  Attention!
[01:51:53.319 --> 01:51:55.260]  This is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:59.724]  Honeybees are now mysteriously vanishing at an astonishing pace across the entire country.
[01:51:59.884 --> 01:52:02.826]  Why is this urgent message about honeybees so desperately important?
[01:52:03.046 --> 01:52:04.007]  The answer is easy.
[01:52:04.147 --> 01:52:10.332]  You see, honeybees produce a unique compound, fed only to the queen, that makes her live six times longer than other bees in the hive.
[01:52:10.552 --> 01:52:14.594]  Some researchers now believe the compound may have miraculous effects on humans as well.
[01:52:14.794 --> 01:52:20.737]  The compound is called Royal Jelly, and is now available in an all-new, ultra-purified form called Jealousine Gold.
[01:52:20.917 --> 01:52:26.320]  The product has been designed for purity-conscious Americans who are concerned about contaminated royal jelly entering the U.S.
[01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:26.821]  from Asia.
[01:52:27.021 --> 01:52:31.363]  Solutions from Science is the only company authorized to sell Jealousine Gold in the U.S.
[01:52:31.603 --> 01:52:35.265]  They believe it to be the purest, most potent, and safest form of royal jelly in the world.
[01:52:35.325 --> 01:52:35.965]  I think so.
[01:53:04.409 --> 01:53:08.032]  You just heard the ad here on the network and they are an important sponsor of the broadcast.
[01:53:08.172 --> 01:53:13.316]  It is produced, grown, developed by the bees, secreted by the bees when you get down to it.
[01:53:13.756 --> 01:53:14.396]  Royal Jelly.
[01:53:14.757 --> 01:53:21.221]  Everybody knows the nutritive effects of bee pollen when they secrete just the pollen before they eat it.
[01:53:21.802 --> 01:53:22.742]  And the Royal Jelly.
[01:53:22.822 --> 01:53:25.364]  And this is high quality made in America at good prices. $8.77.
[01:53:28.641 --> 01:53:30.262]  3-2-7-0-3-6-5 or saferjelly.com.
[01:53:30.282 --> 01:53:32.843]  You should buy it made in the USA anyways.
[01:53:33.403 --> 01:53:38.986]  Everything you see in the store is from China and I remember years ago hearing about bad royal jelly from China.
[01:53:39.526 --> 01:53:45.609]  Long before all the lead paint and the garbage and the rest of it and how the Chinese, when you see Chinese...
[01:53:47.865 --> 01:53:50.827]  Honey, but really a lot of it's corn syrup mixed in.
[01:53:50.868 --> 01:53:52.949]  It's just, they run scams folks.
[01:53:52.989 --> 01:53:53.970]  It's pretty much well known now.
[01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:55.811]  Well, go to saferjelly.com.
[01:53:55.831 --> 01:53:58.474]  There's also the bee shortage, you know, tied into all this.
[01:53:58.514 --> 01:54:00.555]  Just get safe American Well Jelly.

[01:54:13.646 --> 01:54:15.047]  They got a two-month supply for
[01:54:15.885 --> 01:54:18.289]  An individual, which is something everybody should have.
[01:54:18.329 --> 01:54:19.471]  You should have that bare minimum.
[01:54:20.799 --> 01:54:24.060]  And they've got the highest quality right here.
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:25.040]  Grown in America.
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:25.720]  The bananas aren't.
[01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:27.101]  That's the only thing that isn't.
[01:54:27.121 --> 01:54:27.901]  It's American.
[01:54:28.781 --> 01:54:30.722]  It's clean, high quality food.
[01:54:31.302 --> 01:54:33.942]  And this is who I've chosen to buy my affordable foods through.
[01:54:35.043 --> 01:54:37.983]  Give them a call.
[01:54:38.003 --> 01:54:38.664]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:54:38.684 --> 01:54:39.724]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:54:40.104 --> 01:54:41.624]  Or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:54:41.844 --> 01:54:46.926]  And you can't miss the big, huge banners on infowars.com and presentplanet.com.
[01:54:46.986 --> 01:54:47.626]  Wonderful folks.
[01:54:47.686 --> 01:54:48.366]  Give Steve Schenck
[01:54:48.846 --> 01:54:51.568]  And he could direct a call today, the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[01:54:52.329 --> 01:55:13.186]  Going back to Dr. Michael Kaufman and global warming or global governance, in the three or four minutes we've got left here and the five minutes we've got in the next segment, break down any other key points about the film or about this monumental... As a scientist, and I'm not even a scientist, but I've interviewed a lot of other scientists, it's so simple that this is a scam, but for you it must be even crazier.
[01:55:13.206 --> 01:55:17.770]  I mean, what is it like for scientists like yourself and other scientists you talk to to see this fraud going on?
[01:55:18.368 --> 01:55:39.161]  Well, you know, it was back in the 1990s, I was actually leading a multi-million dollar research effort in the effects of global warming on our nation's ecosystems, and I rubbed shoulders with many of these scientists that we talk about today, as well as the government bureaucracies and the environmentalists, and it became very obvious to me very quickly, that's actually why I left my research position, is this was a fraud.
[01:55:39.201 --> 01:55:40.122]  There was no question about it.
[01:55:40.162 --> 01:55:47.827]  This is why I left my job, is to start trying to tell the American people that this thing is part of a huge agenda to create world government
[01:55:48.365 --> 01:55:57.049]  That will be on your back telling you exactly what you can and cannot do, because it was very obvious to me at that time that it was based on nothing but fraud.
[01:55:57.449 --> 01:55:58.390]  And there's nothing changed.
[01:55:58.410 --> 01:56:04.593]  In fact, the science has really gotten much stronger now to actually refute man-caused global warming.
[01:56:05.033 --> 01:56:06.734]  And they still ignore it.
[01:56:06.774 --> 01:56:12.097]  In fact, they just increase the shrill level, because they know their time before the American people really wake up.
[01:56:12.477 --> 01:56:13.857]  And that's why I did this DVD.
[01:56:13.897 --> 01:56:16.959]  I started on this a moment ago, or during the last segment.
[01:56:17.458 --> 01:56:21.942]  That's why I did this DVD, to show you from a scientific standpoint, using real scientists.
[01:56:22.262 --> 01:56:26.445]  These are the same scientists that were on the Global Warming Swindle, Channel 4 of England.
[01:56:28.041 --> 01:56:39.466]  I can tell you, walk you right through the real science of what's going on, and yet on the end of this, I actually go into the global governance side of it, and I put it in a way that is not conspiratorial.
[01:56:40.187 --> 01:56:42.267]  You use their own documents, their own video clips.
[01:56:42.287 --> 01:56:44.148]  I use those documents and so forth.
[01:56:44.208 --> 01:56:45.569]  This is why your film is so important.
[01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:49.811]  You don't just expose that global warming man-made is a fraud, or that it isn't a bad thing anyways.
[01:56:50.031 --> 01:56:52.212]  You also go a step further and show the agenda behind it.
[01:56:52.794 --> 01:56:59.459]  I show the agenda behind it in a way that the average person, and this is key, that the average person can start believing.
[01:57:00.099 --> 01:57:04.382]  If we come across too strong, they're just going to say we're back helicopter nuts and so forth.
[01:57:04.782 --> 01:57:16.130]  But if we do it this way, and this is reports I'm getting back, people who used to believe in man-caused global warming are now converts, they're skeptics, and they're furious that the government is trying to do this on them.
[01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:17.551]  And that's what we want to have.
[01:57:17.891 --> 01:57:20.133]  Stay there five more minutes with our guests and we're going to get
[01:57:20.911 --> 01:57:22.272]  Aaron Russo's widow on.
[01:57:22.292 --> 01:57:23.872]  He, of course, passed last Friday.
[01:57:24.153 --> 01:57:24.713]  Passed over.
[01:57:25.433 --> 01:57:26.414]  In a better place now.
[01:57:26.614 --> 01:57:28.134]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:28.194 --> 01:57:29.715]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:57:33.497 --> 01:57:37.399]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.739 --> 01:57:38.539]  Or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.722 --> 01:57:53.924]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.565 --> 01:57:55.385]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.145 --> 01:57:57.026]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.706 --> 01:58:01.668]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.888 --> 01:58:06.030]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.592 --> 01:58:18.597]  Aaron Russo's wife will be joining us coming up in the next segment.
[01:58:19.426 --> 01:58:29.011]  Heidi Gregg, great lady, talked about Aaron for a couple of segments, and so we remember this important man and his work and his family that lives on.
[01:58:29.031 --> 01:58:44.340]  In this final segment, will Dr. Michael Kaufman continue, for the skeptics out there who still believe the official story, going over a few of the other holes, Dr. Kaufman, that are there for them to investigate?
[01:58:45.254 --> 01:58:50.677]  Well, one of the things that we really need to understand is the fact that there's not going to increase the storm activity.
[01:58:50.797 --> 01:58:52.798]  Carbon dioxide is not driving the temperature.
[01:58:53.418 --> 01:58:57.040]  We're actually seeing that carbon dioxide is a benefit.
[01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:58.741]  We talked about that this last hour.
[01:58:59.381 --> 01:59:11.507]  And one of the things that we really can capitalize on is the fact that this DVD is actually out there and being used to convince your friends and neighbors that this man-caused
[01:59:12.031 --> 01:59:14.573]  Global warming, scare story, it's just that.
[01:59:15.033 --> 01:59:16.594]  There's no substance to it whatsoever.
[01:59:16.674 --> 01:59:19.977]  I have yet to get a call back from people who have bought this and you have it.
[01:59:20.077 --> 01:59:22.038]  You're selling it there on Infowars.com.
[01:59:22.359 --> 01:59:25.361]  You even have a trailer on it if you want to see part of the DVD.
[01:59:26.382 --> 01:59:35.008]  Alex has on Infowars.com a trailer that shows you part of exactly what I do in the DVD and it is so convincing.
[01:59:35.618 --> 01:59:39.282]  That people are literally changing their minds 180 degrees.
[01:59:39.322 --> 01:59:48.531]  But what's important, Alex, is that because I am able to show that this is nothing but a political agenda, people are getting furious.
[01:59:48.651 --> 01:59:51.094]  And these are people that were never on our side before.
[01:59:51.654 --> 01:59:54.457]  These are people that were skeptical of all the things that we're saying.
[01:59:54.857 --> 01:59:57.240]  And now they're beginning to realize there is
[01:59:59.614 --> 02:00:15.985]  Well, a lot of well-meaning liberals are going, wait a minute, when every corporation and the Super Bowl and the NFL and even mainline conservatives are saying global warming is real, we've got to have a global tax, they're saying, wait a minute, that's suspicious.
[02:00:16.005 --> 02:00:20.348]  And they're going, wait a minute, these scientists say they didn't really sign on to this, but the UN says they did.
[02:00:20.368 --> 02:00:23.030]  I mean, it really seems to be imploding right now.
[02:00:23.684 --> 02:00:24.085]  It does.
[02:00:24.785 --> 02:00:27.407]  I'm hoping that this DVD helps it along.
[02:00:27.788 --> 02:00:37.276]  But more than that, I'm hoping that it really helps people to realize that there is an agenda out there and begins to open their minds to the realization that this is happening across the board.
[02:00:38.257 --> 02:00:39.759]  Because it's just not global warming.
[02:00:40.832 --> 02:00:45.555]  It's biology, it's education, it's our court systems, it's almost everything.
[02:00:46.115 --> 02:00:49.276]  And I don't want listeners to think we've won the fight either.
[02:00:49.677 --> 02:00:52.658]  We're now just in the fight.
[02:00:52.698 --> 02:00:55.520]  They're not stopping, they're pushing harder than they ever have before.
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:58.781]  They are, because they know their time is very short.
[02:00:58.821 --> 02:01:06.745]  And we've always realized this, when they really get close to actually closing the jaws on this trap, they're going to have to take some actions that are going to be highly suspicious.
[02:01:06.805 --> 02:01:07.986]  And we're in that period now.
[02:01:08.442 --> 02:01:13.828]  And we need to get this information out to people who are really on the fence and don't understand what's going on.
[02:01:14.169 --> 02:01:20.796]  This DVD will really help them understand and open their minds up to what else is going on outside of the global warming issue.
[02:01:23.199 --> 02:01:28.605]  What type of response are you getting from former global warming adherents?
[02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:36.105]  I am, I'm basically hearing back from people that have bought it that it's shown, the DVD, the global warming adherence.
[02:01:36.486 --> 02:01:41.990]  And they say that in every single case, they walk away shaking their head and say, I cannot believe how we've been deceived.
[02:01:42.471 --> 02:01:43.612]  And they're really angry.
[02:01:45.556 --> 02:01:51.462]  You've got the religious fanatics out there that's going to believe that man is destroying the planet no matter what you say and what proof you have.
[02:01:51.922 --> 02:01:54.184]  You don't even try to reach those people.
[02:01:54.325 --> 02:01:55.265]  And it is a religion!
[02:01:55.306 --> 02:02:02.572]  Whenever I watch Live Earth, they admitted it was a religion and kept calling it a religion and had some weird service at the Vatican.
[02:02:03.673 --> 02:02:04.334]  Did you see that?
[02:02:04.915 --> 02:02:08.418]  No, I haven't seen it, but I've heard about it and I've heard about many other things like that.
[02:02:09.031 --> 02:02:21.316]  And I've actually seen, you know, the whole issue with the Earth Charter that's been going on for 10 years that we stopped in 2002 in Johannesburg in South Africa from being accepted by the United Nations.
[02:02:21.436 --> 02:02:22.616]  It's a religious agenda.
[02:02:22.736 --> 02:02:25.297]  Dr. Michael Kaufman, we're going to get you back up again in the near future.
[02:02:25.337 --> 02:02:27.358]  This story's too big to cover in just two shows.
[02:02:27.678 --> 02:02:28.338]  God bless you.
[02:02:28.438 --> 02:02:29.239]  Great film.
[02:02:29.559 --> 02:02:31.219]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[02:02:31.239 --> 02:02:32.580]  Global warming or global governance?
[02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:33.500]  Take care, Doc.
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:34.500]  Thank you.
[02:02:35.061 --> 02:02:35.861]  We'll be right back.

[02:03:53.845 --> 02:04:01.507]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.188 --> 02:04:09.252]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.652 --> 02:04:21.078]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.378 --> 02:04:24.920]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:27.301]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.601 --> 02:04:31.383]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:05:49.930 --> 02:05:54.133]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:05:54.774 --> 02:05:55.594]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.355 --> 02:05:57.176]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.896 --> 02:06:01.579]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.079 --> 02:06:06.202]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:21.556 --> 02:06:27.403]  You know, I had interviewed Aaron countless times over really the last decade.
[02:06:27.423 --> 02:06:30.646]  I remember interviewing him when he ran for Libertarian President.
[02:06:30.706 --> 02:06:31.728]  I remember interviewing him
[02:06:32.970 --> 02:06:34.952]  Back when he made mad as hell.
[02:06:35.752 --> 02:06:38.654]  And I probably interviewed Aaron probably 50 times.
[02:06:39.215 --> 02:06:41.436]  So I felt like I knew him personally really well.
[02:06:41.456 --> 02:06:42.937]  I spent a lot of hours talking to him.
[02:06:43.338 --> 02:06:45.299]  And then a lot of phone calls off air as well.
[02:06:45.319 --> 02:06:48.902]  But I finally got a chance to meet him in January of this year.
[02:06:48.922 --> 02:06:52.204]  And that video is up on YouTube and Google.
[02:06:52.664 --> 02:06:54.446]  It's about an hour and ten minutes long.
[02:06:54.506 --> 02:06:56.287]  And we're going to air that final ten minutes of it.
[02:06:56.307 --> 02:06:59.970]  We've been airing it in installments this week at the end of the show today.
[02:07:01.628 --> 02:07:06.932]  And Aaron really just had a dynamic attitude.
[02:07:07.893 --> 02:07:12.557]  He was a really bubbly, happy, cheerful guy.
[02:07:12.617 --> 02:07:13.358]  Really smart.
[02:07:13.898 --> 02:07:16.360]  And he was somebody that you just like talking to.
[02:07:16.420 --> 02:07:17.441]  A real genuine person.
[02:07:17.801 --> 02:07:18.422]  A maverick.
[02:07:18.442 --> 02:07:20.904]  We've talked about that this week.
[02:07:21.404 --> 02:07:28.130]  But every time I have a friend or somebody I admire or family die, it sets in.
[02:07:28.650 --> 02:07:30.812]  Like with grandfathers and my grandmother that died.
[02:07:31.511 --> 02:07:33.573]  I've still got a grandmother who's alive, God bless her.
[02:07:33.893 --> 02:07:34.693]  She's a real treasure.
[02:07:34.734 --> 02:07:36.815]  I can't imagine, you know, when she leaves us.
[02:07:37.976 --> 02:07:39.917]  But it seems to set in.
[02:07:40.298 --> 02:07:44.801]  Like when my grandmother a few years ago died, it was really upsetting, but I didn't cry for a couple weeks.
[02:07:45.302 --> 02:07:46.703]  And then now I think about her every day.
[02:07:46.723 --> 02:07:48.664]  I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes thinking about her.
[02:07:50.145 --> 02:07:51.386]  It's strange how that happens.
[02:07:51.446 --> 02:07:52.287]  And now it's been, what?
[02:07:54.489 --> 02:08:07.680]  One, two, three, four, five, six days since Aaron left us, and it's really starting to set in, because he was such a leader in this movement, and he was so articulate in the fight, and just really a strong spirit for liberty.
[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:16.507]  But he lives on in our actions against tyranny, in his film, America, Freedom to Fascism, Mad as Hell, all the interviews he did.
[02:08:16.987 --> 02:08:20.871]  And so we're so honored today to have his girlfriend of 20 years.
[02:08:21.831 --> 02:08:23.613]  They had, of course, children together.
[02:08:24.313 --> 02:08:31.175]  And she just calls him her sweetheart, and that's Heidi Gregg on with us.
[02:08:31.895 --> 02:08:33.576]  Heidi, thank you for spending time with us today.
[02:08:34.036 --> 02:08:34.516]  Hi there.
[02:08:36.057 --> 02:08:43.179]  I'd really just like to give you the floor to talk about Aaron or anything you'd like people to know about his life.
[02:08:43.199 --> 02:08:43.999]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:08:44.379 --> 02:08:51.082]  No, Aaron, he was my sweetheart for 27 years, you know, and he tried to change the world, and he had his beliefs.
[02:08:51.542 --> 02:08:52.462]  He was pure of heart.
[02:08:52.987 --> 02:08:55.968]  And his passions were pure, and he was a very passionate man.
[02:08:56.448 --> 02:08:56.828]  You know?
[02:08:57.188 --> 02:08:59.808]  But not everybody agreed with him, but everybody loved him.
[02:09:00.828 --> 02:09:03.429]  And he was really a good guy, and he was a visionary, you know?
[02:09:04.029 --> 02:09:05.829]  And, uh, his visions were way ahead.
[02:09:06.569 --> 02:09:12.210]  Whether he was making a film, putting on a show, or in the political movement, you know?
[02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:13.310]  He was a great leader.
[02:09:13.891 --> 02:09:16.411]  And, uh, he was truly a passionate man.
[02:09:16.431 --> 02:09:20.352]  So, uh, I don't know.
[02:09:20.412 --> 02:09:22.092]  We were just together for so long,
[02:09:23.070 --> 02:09:28.771]  It was truly one of the most wonderful relationships that we had together.
[02:09:30.892 --> 02:09:37.593]  It doesn't come along in everybody's life, but to have it is really something special.
[02:09:38.613 --> 02:09:39.913]  He was quite a fighter.
[02:09:40.394 --> 02:09:46.715]  The press puts out different reports that he had a five-year or a six-year battle with cancer, but I know it was a long one.
[02:09:46.735 --> 02:09:48.515]  No, it was almost six years.
[02:09:49.555 --> 02:09:51.976]  Almost six years, and he won a lot of hands with it.
[02:09:52.495 --> 02:09:55.996]  But, uh, he lost the last handicard to the cancer.
[02:09:57.537 --> 02:09:59.578]  And, uh, but he fought it.
[02:09:59.638 --> 02:10:00.778]  He fought it really hard.
[02:10:01.379 --> 02:10:03.119]  He fought it alternatively.
[02:10:03.159 --> 02:10:04.880]  He believed in alternative medicine.
[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:07.721]  Um, he tried to do conventional medicine.
[02:10:07.761 --> 02:10:09.062]  That alone almost killed him.
[02:10:09.082 --> 02:10:13.503]  You know, the chemotherapy and... That alone will do you in.
[02:10:13.543 --> 02:10:14.424]  Not the disease.
[02:10:14.544 --> 02:10:17.405]  Just, uh, modern medicine's cures will go for you.
[02:10:17.505 --> 02:10:19.826]  In fact, uh, he finally won about
[02:10:20.632 --> 02:10:22.693]  Eight, nine months ago, I remember I was coming out to L.A.
[02:10:23.453 --> 02:10:25.594]  to interview him, and he was too sick to do the interviews.
[02:10:25.634 --> 02:10:30.776]  We did it in Houston a few months later, but he just tried a few regiments of that chemo.
[02:10:30.836 --> 02:10:33.516]  I know that chemo sure killed my grandfather quickly.
[02:10:34.197 --> 02:10:35.097]  Oh, I remember.
[02:10:35.177 --> 02:10:45.901]  Okay, a year ago, it was on my birthday, and he had his first chemo, and within 24 hours, you could see, like, all the muscles in the body just stop being muscles.
[02:10:46.881 --> 02:10:48.362]  I mean, Aaron was an arm wrestler.
[02:10:48.482 --> 02:10:49.422]  That's how he made his
[02:10:49.875 --> 02:10:52.317]  Living through school with arm wrestling.
[02:10:52.777 --> 02:10:54.238]  And he had these big forearms.
[02:10:54.498 --> 02:10:55.299]  And they were gone.
[02:10:56.579 --> 02:10:57.760]  So people, watch out.
[02:10:59.321 --> 02:11:00.142]  Watch that chemo.
[02:11:00.382 --> 02:11:01.402]  Well, it's pesticide.
[02:11:01.663 --> 02:11:09.147]  They take, in fact, I've seen the molecular makeup of most of the chemo formulas, and it's literally like a can of Raid, but they charge you $5,000 per... Right.
[02:11:09.748 --> 02:11:10.388]  Rat poison.
[02:11:10.588 --> 02:11:11.669]  It's rat poison.
[02:11:12.590 --> 02:11:13.210]  It's awful.
[02:11:14.122 --> 02:11:18.745]  You know, and you see what it does to people, and some people do okay with it.
[02:11:18.785 --> 02:11:20.026]  Some people survive it.
[02:11:20.626 --> 02:11:23.689]  But somehow I relate to cancer like an ingrown hair.
[02:11:23.749 --> 02:11:26.130]  Unless you get the root, it keeps coming back.
[02:11:27.371 --> 02:11:29.412]  Well, I've got questions here on the message board.
[02:11:32.603 --> 02:11:38.386]  You know, privately said to me that he was suspicious that right after he refused the New World Order's approaches that he got cancer.
[02:11:38.807 --> 02:11:41.468]  And I know they have patented ways of giving you cancer.
[02:11:41.488 --> 02:11:43.909]  Did Aaron ever say anything near the end there?
[02:11:44.050 --> 02:11:46.951]  Oh no, come on.
[02:11:47.331 --> 02:11:47.872]  No.
[02:11:47.892 --> 02:11:49.793]  I don't think so.
[02:11:49.813 --> 02:11:52.875]  I don't think you do that to somebody.
[02:11:53.115 --> 02:11:54.095]  What gives you cancer?
[02:11:54.115 --> 02:11:56.857]  White flour, white sugar, stress.
[02:12:02.210 --> 02:12:05.652]  Not taking time to smell the roses, take a swim in a lagoon.
[02:12:08.354 --> 02:12:09.254]  He was passionate.
[02:12:10.255 --> 02:12:12.416]  And he gave everything to this movement.
[02:12:13.877 --> 02:12:17.279]  And that, along with white flour, white sugar.
[02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:21.881]  So that's what you think got him?
[02:12:22.021 --> 02:12:24.843]  Yes, that's what sugar and flour feed cancer.
[02:12:24.983 --> 02:12:26.244]  Cancer loves to eat sugar.
[02:12:27.164 --> 02:12:28.105]  Aaron loves to eat sugar.
[02:12:28.125 --> 02:12:28.645]  Come on.
[02:12:30.925 --> 02:12:35.248]  Well, I've certainly seen the studies on that and I agree with you, that's certainly a big... That's right.
[02:12:35.848 --> 02:12:41.131]  And he was a mental person, not a physical person.
[02:12:41.171 --> 02:12:47.234]  Heidi... You know, there's a little combination of everything to one's longevity and to one's health care.
[02:12:48.755 --> 02:12:51.617]  And he put everything into what he did.
[02:12:52.757 --> 02:12:54.338]  And not taking care of himself.
[02:12:54.438 --> 02:12:59.842]  I want to go back in time, when Aaron first woke up to the new order and first got mad.
[02:13:00.723 --> 02:13:01.684]  You were there at that time.
[02:13:01.704 --> 02:13:03.185]  Can you describe that?
[02:13:03.205 --> 02:13:05.947]  Oh my God, we had just come back into this country.
[02:13:06.047 --> 02:13:07.829]  We were living abroad.
[02:13:09.050 --> 02:13:11.531]  And he wrote a very passionate letter.
[02:13:11.551 --> 02:13:13.613]  Oh my gosh, which I do have.
[02:13:15.174 --> 02:13:16.956]  How he felt about the government.
[02:13:16.996 --> 02:13:19.598]  And I remember he was going to publish it.
[02:13:19.638 --> 02:13:21.299]  He wanted to put it in the New York Times.
[02:13:22.601 --> 02:13:28.465]  And I don't know why we didn't at one point, but that's when he started the Constitution Party.
[02:13:30.306 --> 02:13:35.249]  And I don't remember what year that was, but probably if I look on the wall, there's a frame something from it.
[02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:38.531]  But, um, and that's when all that started.
[02:13:39.092 --> 02:13:40.713]  When we came back to this country.
[02:13:42.694 --> 02:13:49.919]  So, uh, yes, the, uh, and then it just steamrolled into Matt as hell.
[02:13:51.365 --> 02:14:02.715]  the video that he did and uh... which will be coming back out people so many people have sent me emails asking if Matt as hell would come back out and it will be re-released soon in dvd format.
[02:14:02.895 --> 02:14:05.497]  That's great, we'll carry it because it's an excellent presentation.
[02:14:05.557 --> 02:14:10.441]  It's a great piece, it's a great thing to bring out of the archives, you know?
[02:14:11.522 --> 02:14:19.849]  and uh... now and then he made Matt as Hell and then it parlayed into him going to Nevada
[02:14:20.757 --> 02:14:22.077]  And running for governor there.
[02:14:23.938 --> 02:14:26.919]  And then it parlayed into running for president.
[02:14:27.579 --> 02:14:35.441]  Heidi, what were some of the things that, if you would share this with the audience, I'd appreciate it if you don't feel like it was too painful, I understand.
[02:14:35.501 --> 02:14:48.585]  Well, the audience and a lot of others would like to know some of the last things Aaron said or anything he wanted to impart to the world, you know, there at the end, or did he know, going into late last week, that he was at the end of the road?
[02:14:49.815 --> 02:14:52.696]  He would just like people to keep on fighting a good fight.
[02:14:53.836 --> 02:14:56.516]  And to fight for their rights and what they believe in.
[02:14:56.536 --> 02:15:07.739]  And to just carry his message and platform and hopefully elect a president where we will have some change in this country.
[02:15:07.759 --> 02:15:11.599]  Do you specifically remember his last words on the Freedom Movement?
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:16.360]  There weren't last words on the Freedom Movement.
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:19.041]  The Freedom Movement had gotten quiet for him.
[02:15:19.608 --> 02:15:24.729]  He had to stop doing the Freedom Movement for a while for his own health at the end.
[02:15:24.909 --> 02:15:26.990]  I remember just a few, about a month and a half ago.
[02:15:27.710 --> 02:15:27.950]  Yes.
[02:15:28.330 --> 02:15:30.331]  It was time he had to just stop with that.
[02:15:31.871 --> 02:15:32.512]  He had to stop.
[02:15:32.532 --> 02:15:40.454]  Yeah, I don't think people realize, and I didn't really want to broadcast at the time, but he was in tough shape when I saw him in January and he was still doing interviews and trying to go places.
[02:15:40.594 --> 02:15:42.474]  He was doing everything until the very end.
[02:15:45.235 --> 02:15:48.356]  Because he was a mental person and he had a vision.
[02:15:49.938 --> 02:15:52.079]  And when you have a vision, you live that vision.
[02:15:52.719 --> 02:15:54.800]  You don't deal always in reality.
[02:15:56.740 --> 02:15:58.681]  You see your vision and you want to complete it.
[02:15:58.841 --> 02:16:01.262]  And it needs to be completed before you move on.
[02:16:02.662 --> 02:16:06.003]  And he worked very hard to get this movement going.
[02:16:06.343 --> 02:16:11.265]  How sick was Aaron when he, he told me he was very sick whenever he made America Freedom from Fascism, but he kept that quiet.
[02:16:11.285 --> 02:16:12.325]  He was very sick then.
[02:16:12.985 --> 02:16:13.906]  He was very sick.
[02:16:14.526 --> 02:16:17.707]  But his vision and his passion carried him through
[02:16:18.686 --> 02:16:20.747]  The making of the film, the editing of the film.
[02:16:20.788 --> 02:16:21.948]  He did everything himself.
[02:16:22.008 --> 02:16:22.749]  He had helpers.
[02:16:23.429 --> 02:16:26.712]  But really, he's, you know, he's a hands-on guy and he does it himself.
[02:16:28.093 --> 02:16:28.413]  You know?
[02:16:29.414 --> 02:16:32.896]  So, that was his message, that was his film, and that is who he is.
[02:16:33.436 --> 02:16:37.659]  Heidi, is it, is it... I mean, how are you handling things just a few days into this?
[02:16:37.699 --> 02:16:42.363]  Is it starting to... I mean, are you missing Aaron?
[02:16:43.083 --> 02:16:43.844]  Oh, of course!
[02:16:44.544 --> 02:16:46.185]  Oh, I miss him dearly.
[02:16:46.766 --> 02:16:48.187]  It's very quiet around here.
[02:16:48.703 --> 02:16:56.367]  He was a big man, and there was always noise around him, and everybody who comes over goes, this is really weird in here, let's go out.
[02:16:56.827 --> 02:16:58.568]  Because it's so quiet.
[02:16:59.148 --> 02:17:01.129]  I think people feel that his spirit has moved on.
[02:17:01.830 --> 02:17:03.851]  Oh, of course his spirit has moved on.
[02:17:04.971 --> 02:17:07.633]  We're all, our spirits move on, we are energy.
[02:17:08.033 --> 02:17:09.013]  And we live forever.
[02:17:10.694 --> 02:17:13.636]  And Aaron will live forever, in all these people's hearts and minds.
[02:17:13.656 --> 02:17:18.318]  Through everything he's done.
[02:17:18.996 --> 02:17:24.018]  Either it's his Hollywood films or his political movement.
[02:17:25.659 --> 02:17:27.460]  You know, it doesn't die.
[02:17:28.100 --> 02:17:29.440]  There's a record of it all.
[02:17:30.721 --> 02:17:31.741]  Heidi Gregg, stay there.
[02:17:31.761 --> 02:17:42.826]  We're going to come right back and talk more about your sweetheart, your boyfriend of 27 years, who you had children with, just a great man, Aaron Russo.

[02:17:50.558 --> 02:17:55.022]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.

[02:18:09.435 --> 02:18:28.650]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.

[02:18:32.613 --> 02:18:35.295]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[02:18:38.337 --> 02:18:50.102]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us up the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:18:50.142 --> 02:18:51.402]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:18:51.542 --> 02:18:55.124]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:18:55.424 --> 02:18:57.925]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[02:18:58.325 --> 02:19:00.086]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:19:00.406 --> 02:19:02.707]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:19:03.767 --> 02:19:07.509]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:19:07.549 --> 02:19:09.390]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.

[02:19:48.361 --> 02:19:52.623]  Did you know that the United Nations has never fulfilled its sole goal for existing?
[02:19:53.143 --> 02:19:54.384]  Maintaining world peace?
[02:19:54.964 --> 02:19:55.844]  Do you know why?
[02:19:56.045 --> 02:19:58.386]  Everywhere they've been involved, it becomes worse.

[02:20:18.125 --> 02:20:24.350]  Did you know the rogue nations and terrorist organizations have been purchasing suitcase nuclear bombs on the black market?
[02:20:25.130 --> 02:20:26.511]  Will they use them on America?

[02:20:45.458 --> 02:20:47.320]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:20:47.460 --> 02:20:52.644]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:20:52.804 --> 02:20:54.145]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:20:54.425 --> 02:21:02.592]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:21:02.812 --> 02:21:08.557]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:21:08.717 --> 02:21:10.498]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:21:10.559 --> 02:21:12.700]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:21:12.740 --> 02:21:17.104]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:21:17.284 --> 02:21:19.446]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:21:19.506 --> 02:21:25.811]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their heart healthy.
[02:21:29.045 --> 02:21:29.506]  I think so.
[02:22:05.288 --> 02:22:12.849]  Aaron Russo's passing over, his moving on, only reminds us how fleeting life is, how precious, how fragile.
[02:22:13.596 --> 02:22:23.564]  How dear and how we should live each moment each day as if it's our last and stop being into petty baubles and trinkets but to be into ideas and building things and loving those that are around us.
[02:22:24.144 --> 02:22:28.968]  We all strive to do that and I've got a chance to meet Heidi Gregg in person.
[02:22:29.008 --> 02:22:32.531]  She is a really dear, sweet, intelligent person.
[02:22:32.731 --> 02:22:37.655]  A good mate for Aaron Russo and of course he was great for her.
[02:22:38.276 --> 02:22:41.378]  Just a wonderful pair who again lived 27 years together.
[02:22:43.991 --> 02:22:49.114]  We should all pray for her and of course her son and daughter, Aaron's son and daughter.
[02:22:49.134 --> 02:22:52.575]  Heidi, there's so much to talk about here.
[02:22:54.736 --> 02:22:55.716]  You've got the floor.
[02:22:56.177 --> 02:23:04.180]  What should we know about Aaron Russo or what would you like to add about this expansive, just so important life?
[02:23:05.305 --> 02:23:06.545]  First of all, he has two boys.
[02:23:06.565 --> 02:23:07.485]  He doesn't have a daughter.
[02:23:07.505 --> 02:23:07.845]  That's right.
[02:23:07.865 --> 02:23:08.266]  Two boys.
[02:23:08.286 --> 02:23:08.686]  That's right.
[02:23:08.706 --> 02:23:10.446]  If he had a daughter, it would be his little dog here.
[02:23:11.306 --> 02:23:12.086]  That's Socky!
[02:23:12.126 --> 02:23:12.566]  That's right.
[02:23:12.726 --> 02:23:13.326]  That's right.
[02:23:13.407 --> 02:23:14.507]  Socky is his daughter.
[02:23:14.527 --> 02:23:16.067]  At least I got the dog's name right now.
[02:23:16.327 --> 02:23:16.987]  That's a good one.
[02:23:17.007 --> 02:23:17.707]  There you go.
[02:23:17.747 --> 02:23:19.388]  Now his boys, Max and Sam.
[02:23:20.168 --> 02:23:20.548]  Yeah.
[02:23:20.908 --> 02:23:22.288]  My son and his son.
[02:23:23.048 --> 02:23:24.409]  They will miss him dearly.
[02:23:25.049 --> 02:23:27.109]  He was a fabulous father for them.
[02:23:27.489 --> 02:23:28.689]  And many of their friends.
[02:23:28.989 --> 02:23:29.810]  I'll tell you something.
[02:23:29.870 --> 02:23:32.030]  I lose a lot of kids coming over here going,
[02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:38.027]  Oh my God, they're in shock because he was a father to them all and he taught them about the world.
[02:23:38.808 --> 02:23:42.773]  About the truth in politics and finance and in life.
[02:23:43.694 --> 02:23:44.976]  And these kids are heartbroken.
[02:23:44.996 --> 02:23:46.177]  It's really sad for them.
[02:23:47.218 --> 02:23:49.962]  You know, it's very sweet that they feel that way about him.
[02:23:51.434 --> 02:23:51.894]  Where were we?
[02:23:52.355 --> 02:24:02.283]  Well, the difference is that, you know, when another Hollywood producer dies, even notable ones, it's a minor footnote, or when some rich banker dies, nobody really cares.
[02:24:02.343 --> 02:24:09.989]  But when somebody like your husband, it's another example of the bumper sticker that says the one with the most toys, you know, when they die wins, that's really a fraud.
[02:24:10.029 --> 02:24:14.272]  It's the person that really was a champion and a hero for liberty.
[02:24:14.292 --> 02:24:18.736]  I mean, people are going to remember Aaron Russo 100 years from now, and they're not going to remember Alberto Gonzalez.
[02:24:19.318 --> 02:24:20.238]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:24:20.298 --> 02:24:20.798]  Are you kidding?
[02:24:20.838 --> 02:24:34.502]  I mean, it's amazing the amount of people who are calling and those who are almost like, as they say, coming out of the woodwork who I haven't seen in a million and one years and just the stories that they tell of their experiences with Aaron.
[02:24:35.423 --> 02:24:38.544]  Before the 27 years with me, there's a lot of story.
[02:24:38.704 --> 02:24:46.726]  I mean, he made Bette Midler her career and Bette came and spent a few moments with Aaron before he passed on.
[02:24:47.259 --> 02:24:55.142]  And this was a very, I thought, when I spoke to her and asked her to come, that it was a very important thing for their relationship as closure.
[02:24:55.162 --> 02:24:58.443]  I mean, he, again, he's a great visionary.
[02:24:58.463 --> 02:24:59.764]  Look at the shows he put on.
[02:25:00.364 --> 02:25:03.305]  You know, that tells you what's in a man's mind.
[02:25:03.545 --> 02:25:05.006]  And he really discovered that, didn't he?
[02:25:05.646 --> 02:25:06.206]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:06.406 --> 02:25:10.008]  Well, he found her and she was working in the bathhouses.
[02:25:11.308 --> 02:25:16.310]  And he saw her on Johnny Carson one night and connected up with her and made her
[02:25:17.310 --> 02:25:18.091]  A great star.
[02:25:19.912 --> 02:25:28.458]  And she's a brilliant performer and actually at the beginning of the year she'll be playing in Vegas at Caesar.
[02:25:29.399 --> 02:25:30.880]  Did she come see him last week?
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:34.482]  Oh yeah, she saw him the night before he passed away.
[02:25:34.562 --> 02:25:40.847]  So you guys knew because there was a few close calls and I talked to Aaron a few months ago and he said, I gotta quit this stuff, I almost died last week.
[02:25:41.557 --> 02:25:45.779]  Then he quit because I said, the party's over here, you guys.
[02:25:45.819 --> 02:25:47.060]  You can't do this anymore.
[02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:50.681]  I mean, I would feel guilty because Aaron would call me wanting to come on.
[02:25:50.701 --> 02:25:52.722]  I'm like, Aaron, no, no, you're sick.
[02:25:52.742 --> 02:25:53.503]  You need to get better.
[02:25:53.523 --> 02:25:58.025]  He's like, no, I need to... But that too keeps him alive, you see.
[02:25:58.245 --> 02:25:58.925]  The passion.
[02:25:59.245 --> 02:26:00.566]  That all keeps your heart going.
[02:26:00.946 --> 02:26:02.027]  It keeps you alive.
[02:26:02.107 --> 02:26:02.707]  The fire.
[02:26:03.127 --> 02:26:05.328]  Because that's who he was to the very end.
[02:26:06.108 --> 02:26:07.169]  He had to be himself.
[02:26:08.436 --> 02:26:17.503]  Well, I know that he said he talked to a lot of doctors, and of course I've had experience with cancer seeing it in family, that Aaron went, I mean, most people would be dead in six months with the kind of cancers he had.
[02:26:17.983 --> 02:26:25.089]  Of course, I'll tell you, you know, there was a lot of doctors who I would run into who he had seen or used in the past, and they were like, really?
[02:26:25.289 --> 02:26:25.970]  He's still alive?
[02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:36.238]  And they were in shock, because they thought, they told him to go home ages ago, get your life in order, and call the hospice, and he, that's not who he is.
[02:26:37.113 --> 02:26:37.914]  He's a fighter.
[02:26:38.234 --> 02:26:40.175]  It was like when we were in different clinics.
[02:26:40.195 --> 02:26:45.178]  When we were in Germany, I mean, everybody at the clinics was so happy to have him around because he had the best attitude.
[02:26:45.198 --> 02:26:48.520]  He didn't let the cancer get him down.
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:55.224]  You know, he was still joking and laughing and, you know, he wasn't going to go there in his mind.
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:26:58.021]  I mean, that's half the defeat.
[02:26:58.281 --> 02:27:04.384]  Think of what he did in the six years, or nearly six years, you know, all the speaking and the film.
[02:27:04.464 --> 02:27:10.127]  I mean, thank God he didn't give up, because I think he produced his most important work there in those final years.
[02:27:10.627 --> 02:27:11.368]  He may have.
[02:27:11.728 --> 02:27:12.448]  He may have.
[02:27:13.009 --> 02:27:13.789]  You never know.
[02:27:13.809 --> 02:27:16.290]  It could be, you never know.
[02:27:17.351 --> 02:27:20.413]  But that was his most passionate piece of work.
[02:27:20.693 --> 02:27:21.033]  Absolutely.
[02:27:21.053 --> 02:27:22.934]  That was where his heart lied.
[02:27:23.493 --> 02:27:28.679]  I mean, yes, he made great movies, Trading Places, The Rose, and that was all in his passion.
[02:27:28.699 --> 02:27:29.400]  Stay there, Heidi.
[02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:30.081]  We gotta break.
[02:27:30.101 --> 02:27:32.404]  We'll be right back with Heidi on the other side.
[02:27:35.828 --> 02:27:36.729]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.209 --> 02:27:38.831]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.752 --> 02:27:42.436]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.931 --> 02:27:50.212]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:27:50.472 --> 02:27:55.293]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:27:55.573 --> 02:27:56.894]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:27:57.074 --> 02:28:00.654]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:30:39.322 --> 02:30:40.682]  And it's going down like that dinosaur.
[02:31:11.170 --> 02:31:11.613]  Yeah.
[02:31:40.961 --> 02:31:44.983]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:45.083 --> 02:31:45.883]  Welcome back.
[02:31:45.903 --> 02:31:46.624]  Heidi Gregg.
[02:32:05.569 --> 02:32:16.255]  Aaron Russo's girlfriend of 27 years, the mother of their children, a great lady who Aaron's passion, of course, lives on.
[02:32:16.516 --> 02:32:20.718]  Through her, she has the same passion, and with her two sons, Max and Sam.
[02:32:21.999 --> 02:32:35.147]  Heidi, in closing, and I appreciate you coming on, I want to give you a chance to make any other comments or statements on the record for all of Aaron's supporters and admirers and people who have just really appreciated the work of your
[02:32:35.962 --> 02:32:59.245]  of your wonderful man Aaron Russo but I wanted to bring up a subject that you know I know I broached to you but it's important because I know how much films cost to make and to have distributed like he did I know that he put it up on Google Video for free and I know that Aaron has only made back a fraction of the money he bought ads on Fox TV folks and they so
[02:33:01.009 --> 02:33:22.686]  That you guys have lost quite a bit of money making America Freedom to Fascism, so I hope they'll go to Infowars.com, because we buy them from you, or go to AmericaFreedomtoFascism.com, or go to your sites directly, or sites that actually get them directly from you, because there's a lot of bootlegs out there, and we'll buy a copy or two of America Freedom to Fascism from your site, or my site, or a few of the other sites that have actual copies from you.
[02:33:23.467 --> 02:33:25.288]  And more than that, when the
[02:33:26.750 --> 02:33:37.697]  Mattis Hell Video comes back out again to remember you in a few months, to go to the site, to purchase it then, to support you, because it is so important that people do that.
[02:33:37.757 --> 02:33:52.306]  Give out some of the websites and tell folks how they can frankly support you so that Aaron's sacrifice of making that film doesn't hurt the family too much more than it already has cost you.
[02:33:53.087 --> 02:33:57.249]  It's already cost us, because Aaron believes when you want to do something, you do it yourself.
[02:33:57.329 --> 02:33:59.210]  So he paid for the film himself.
[02:33:59.851 --> 02:34:01.471]  This is an out-of-pocket film.
[02:34:02.492 --> 02:34:13.998]  So everybody, go to our website, freedomtofascism.com, please buy DVDs, please support and help replenish what was spent on making a film that he gave to the people.
[02:34:14.718 --> 02:34:21.262]  And through his heart is why he put it on Google for free, so that everybody and anybody who didn't have any money
[02:34:21.733 --> 02:34:26.214]  Or people who would see it and say, hey, I want a copy of that for myself, would go and buy it.
[02:34:27.215 --> 02:34:32.116]  And especially with Matt is Hell coming back out, there are so many requests to see this.
[02:34:32.136 --> 02:34:34.337]  I've been getting demands!
[02:34:34.677 --> 02:34:37.278]  I've been getting demands too, that's very funny.
[02:34:37.318 --> 02:34:41.159]  People have been writing letters and sending emails, please bring it back out.
[02:34:42.040 --> 02:34:45.521]  So this coming week I will start working on it.
[02:34:45.561 --> 02:34:49.302]  Well not this week, actually after Aaron's memorial I will
[02:34:50.069 --> 02:34:53.231]  Start working, getting mad as hell back out, and it should be a few weeks.
[02:34:53.531 --> 02:34:58.894]  And Heidi, you don't want a three ring circus at that, but people should just watch freedomtofascism.com.
[02:34:58.954 --> 02:34:59.294]  Oh, yes.
[02:34:59.514 --> 02:35:00.795]  I'm going to do a live feed.
[02:35:00.855 --> 02:35:01.695]  I'm working on it.
[02:35:02.056 --> 02:35:02.816]  I'm working on it.
[02:35:03.476 --> 02:35:10.220]  And hopefully there will be a live feed on September 7th at 11 in the morning on the website.
[02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:17.564]  I would like to show everybody, because I know everybody can't come, and it would be crazy if everybody did, because then I'd need the Hollywood Bowl.
[02:35:18.184 --> 02:35:19.345]  And I can't do that.
[02:35:20.094 --> 02:35:23.637]  Well, I'll tell you this... What's happening for Aaron's Memorial.
[02:35:24.217 --> 02:35:25.618]  Now, now... I think it's a good thing.
[02:35:25.898 --> 02:35:27.780]  Sure, and it's very important.
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:32.083]  And I am going to video it, and I will put up videos if people would like to see.
[02:35:33.744 --> 02:35:38.027]  And I just want everybody to be able to see what's going on, knowing everybody can't be there.
[02:35:39.048 --> 02:35:47.333]  Well, we'll also attempt, if it's okay with you, on this show Friday, regardless if I'm there or not, to carry the audio here on Genesis.
[02:35:47.454 --> 02:35:47.934]  Is that good?
[02:35:48.977 --> 02:35:49.718]  That's fine.
[02:35:49.898 --> 02:35:52.399]  I mean, I don't know how to do any of that, but we'll figure it out.
[02:35:52.439 --> 02:35:54.100]  Well, we would just tap into your feed.
[02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:55.161]  Okay.
[02:35:55.801 --> 02:35:58.083]  I have no problem with that.
[02:35:58.263 --> 02:36:00.624]  You'll probably have thousands, though, wanting to hit it.
[02:36:01.004 --> 02:36:02.725]  Well, that's all a logistical situation.
[02:36:02.765 --> 02:36:07.968]  I would do several feeds, but I know you're so busy, Heidi, and there you are fighting, wanting to get the word out.
[02:36:08.669 --> 02:36:09.769]  I want to get the word out.
[02:36:09.889 --> 02:36:17.334]  I want to keep working and keep busy here, because Aaron had other projects going besides his
[02:36:17.887 --> 02:36:18.948]  Political movement.
[02:36:19.689 --> 02:36:28.460]  You know, he's still a film producer, or he was still a film producer, and we still have projects, and I'm still trying to work and keep things going here, because I have a family!
[02:36:29.068 --> 02:36:31.389]  Well, I want to put the call out to everybody.
[02:36:32.009 --> 02:36:38.772]  I tried to support Aaron as best I could, promoting FreedomToFascism.com for people to get it there or at Infowars.com.
[02:36:39.332 --> 02:36:43.773]  Either way, I think right now it's best for you to get it at FreedomToFascism.com.
[02:36:43.813 --> 02:36:46.274]  That way you know the full amount goes to support them.
[02:36:46.654 --> 02:36:49.075]  I know he bought ads on Fox TV.
[02:36:49.616 --> 02:36:50.796]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:36:51.096 --> 02:36:53.377]  He paid a distributor to try to put it in theaters.
[02:36:53.857 --> 02:37:00.580]  That's right, and we took it to the Cannes Film Festival, and we did so many things with that movie.
[02:37:00.881 --> 02:37:14.667]  Well, I mean, it's a powerful film, and you deserve, you need to be able to at least make some of the money back that you put into that, so that's why I'm just honored to be able to support Aaron and your work, because Heidi, you are, of course, there in support of the whole thing as well.
[02:37:14.767 --> 02:37:20.170]  In closing, I just want you to know that I mean it when I say it, and people know that, but the point is,
[02:37:20.410 --> 02:37:24.272]  Aaron was a dynamic person, a wonderful personality, a great spirit.
[02:37:24.292 --> 02:37:25.493]  He's a visionary.
[02:37:25.933 --> 02:37:27.514]  A visionary, a maverick.
[02:37:28.515 --> 02:37:30.336]  Definitely a maverick, a rebel.
[02:37:30.396 --> 02:37:31.617]  He was a freedom fighter.
[02:37:32.397 --> 02:37:39.561]  And I'll tell you something, I've had so many calls from people, Hollywood people, who have gone, oh my God, who am I going to argue with now?
[02:37:40.562 --> 02:37:44.024]  Yeah, I know.
[02:37:45.085 --> 02:37:47.346]  They had so much fun having conversations.
[02:37:48.024 --> 02:37:51.786]  And it's spirited conversation, not one-sided, you know?
[02:37:51.806 --> 02:37:53.627]  He gave you a run for your money.
[02:37:53.947 --> 02:38:02.190]  Well, I know that I watched American Freedom from Fascism with Charlie at his house last year out in Hollywood, and I was going to meet with Aaron, but he was too sick.
[02:38:02.210 --> 02:38:04.852]  He had to go to Houston, and then I met with him there later, as you know.
[02:38:06.192 --> 02:38:07.933]  But Charlie said it was just all over Hollywood.
[02:38:07.973 --> 02:38:09.294]  It was really waking a lot of people up.
[02:38:09.934 --> 02:38:10.614]  I hope so.
[02:38:10.994 --> 02:38:16.697]  I hope so, and I hope everybody just tells everybody and keep passing it around.
[02:38:17.267 --> 02:38:19.449]  That's what it's all about, is getting it out there.
[02:38:19.469 --> 02:38:23.452]  I know after Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt saw it, she ran off and joined the CFR.
[02:38:23.592 --> 02:38:26.094]  She might be, I guess, spying on them from within or something.
[02:38:26.274 --> 02:38:27.295]  Oh, I doubt that.
[02:38:27.375 --> 02:38:29.697]  I doubt she even really knows what she joined.
[02:38:30.798 --> 02:38:34.280]  There's so many multi-levels to every organization, aren't there?
[02:38:34.620 --> 02:38:36.542]  I just know she wants to help African children, yeah.
[02:38:36.922 --> 02:38:38.383]  Well, and that's a good thing.
[02:38:39.104 --> 02:38:41.086]  That's fabulous to go help children.
[02:38:41.786 --> 02:38:44.008]  You know, children all over the world need help.
[02:38:44.028 --> 02:38:45.489]  We have children here who need help.
[02:38:45.985 --> 02:38:47.585]  Everywhere in the world they need help.
[02:38:48.186 --> 02:38:48.846]  Look at the world.
[02:38:48.926 --> 02:38:50.566]  Look at the situation this world's in.
[02:38:50.606 --> 02:38:52.827]  It's a pretty sad situation.
[02:38:53.727 --> 02:38:56.868]  So anyone who offers help to others, I think it's wonderful.
[02:38:58.008 --> 02:39:03.070]  Well, I know that Aaron's spirit lives on in his work and in... Absolutely.
[02:39:03.230 --> 02:39:06.231]  And in everybody out there who continues the fight against tyranny.
[02:39:06.751 --> 02:39:09.071]  And it is a life well led.
[02:39:09.111 --> 02:39:12.412]  I mean, at the end of it... Well, he had a full, wonderful life.
[02:39:12.472 --> 02:39:14.513]  He's done so many things in his life.
[02:39:15.307 --> 02:39:20.088]  He's a very lucky man to have been able to do what he did in his life.
[02:39:20.588 --> 02:39:22.509]  He had huge rock and roll clubs.
[02:39:23.089 --> 02:39:25.749]  Led Zeppelin first played in his club in Chicago.
[02:39:25.809 --> 02:39:27.189]  Come on, how many people can say that?
[02:39:27.390 --> 02:39:27.510]  One.
[02:39:28.330 --> 02:39:28.650]  You know?
[02:39:29.470 --> 02:39:31.170]  He's done so many things in his life.
[02:39:31.210 --> 02:39:33.151]  He's done Broadway shows.
[02:39:33.171 --> 02:39:39.692]  Well, I just hope at the end of my life I could have lived an honorable and full life.
[02:39:39.712 --> 02:39:40.512]  Honorable, yes.
[02:39:41.512 --> 02:39:42.973]  Yes, because he was.
[02:39:43.013 --> 02:39:43.793]  He was pure of heart.
[02:39:44.306 --> 02:39:47.008]  And he was pure in passion.
[02:39:47.028 --> 02:39:49.069]  And that's what's most important, you know?
[02:39:49.089 --> 02:39:52.591]  He just, he was full of heart and soul.
[02:39:53.471 --> 02:39:54.432]  And to all.
[02:39:54.832 --> 02:39:57.013]  He really, he loved people and he loved life.
[02:39:58.094 --> 02:39:59.995]  And the man had a big heart.
[02:40:00.615 --> 02:40:01.475]  A really big heart.
[02:40:03.256 --> 02:40:12.922]  Heidi, after the memorial and when there's video clips up on freedomtofascism.com, I certainly want to play some clips of those and have you back up for a segment or two next week just to talk about
[02:40:14.349 --> 02:40:15.010]  Give me a call.
[02:40:15.310 --> 02:40:15.631]  Okay.
[02:40:15.691 --> 02:40:16.672]  I'm around here working.
[02:40:16.992 --> 02:40:18.954]  Okay, Heidi, we're praying for you and the family.
[02:40:18.974 --> 02:40:20.056]  Thank you so much.
[02:40:20.636 --> 02:40:22.358]  And everybody, please go to the website.
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:24.481]  All right?
[02:40:24.881 --> 02:40:25.422]  Absolutely.
[02:40:25.442 --> 02:40:29.527]  Heidi Gregg, thank you for spending time with us.
[02:40:29.967 --> 02:40:30.448]  You got it.
[02:40:30.488 --> 02:40:32.330]  Thank you, Alex, and bye everybody.
[02:40:32.530 --> 02:40:32.931]  God bless.
[02:40:33.877 --> 02:40:40.118]  Well, what a really sweet and intelligent lady, and going through a lot, and keeping herself busy memorializing Aaron.
[02:40:40.158 --> 02:40:42.619]  That's the best thing, and really a strong woman.
[02:40:42.659 --> 02:40:52.760]  So that was a very important interview, and I'm glad that we got in touch with her, and that she wanted to come on the show, and that we could also try to help them defer the cost of that film.
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:41:01.882]  I mean, I think, talking to Aaron, I think promotion and the rollout, and he tried to do the mainline rollout in the theaters, and then noticed the prints had problems, and all the rest of it.
[02:41:03.762 --> 02:41:08.485]  That it put him quite a bit in the hole on that end, so that's why I'm certainly hoping that you support him.
[02:41:09.626 --> 02:41:20.994]  And that's why you need to support this radio show, ladies and gentlemen, because I bring up the activists, I bring up the leaders, I bring up the small guys, I bring them all up.
[02:41:21.694 --> 02:41:27.278]  I have an open hand, open embrace to anybody in the Patriot or Truth movement.
[02:41:27.913 --> 02:41:30.215]  Now once I get bit a couple times, I never work with you again.
[02:41:30.395 --> 02:41:31.275]  Used to, I put up with it.
[02:41:31.315 --> 02:41:32.596]  I do not put up with any of it now.
[02:41:33.057 --> 02:41:36.919]  I'm nothing but nice, nothing but square dealing, nothing but helpful to everybody.
[02:41:37.179 --> 02:41:39.901]  You cross me one time, you're out of my life forever.
[02:41:40.442 --> 02:41:43.384]  And then a lot of people out there squealing and crying because they're not in my life anymore.
[02:41:43.404 --> 02:41:49.368]  It's because I'm just old enough now where I don't feel bad about throwing somebody off my back when they get on my back.
[02:41:51.241 --> 02:41:58.867]  But Aaron Russo is somebody who was nothing but good to me and just a good genuine real person and I'm really happy to be able to be here and support him and I'm glad that you're supporting him.
[02:42:00.021 --> 02:42:05.622]  Now that he's died, and his family, and we'll ensure that his work continues to go forward and move forward.
[02:42:06.202 --> 02:42:10.763]  I also want to thank all of our A&M Affiliates, our shortwave affiliate, internet affiliate, satellite affiliates.
[02:42:11.024 --> 02:42:12.924]  I want to thank John Harmon who runs the show up at The Network.
[02:42:12.944 --> 02:42:15.905]  I want to thank my producer who produces the show, Trey Kincaid.
[02:42:15.925 --> 02:42:22.526]  I want to thank Rob Jacobson doing a great job editing the films, Aaron Dykes, Mike Nelson, of course, Weldon Henson.
[02:42:23.386 --> 02:42:26.427]  There's Tim here in the office doing an unbelievably good job.
[02:42:27.562 --> 02:42:32.406]  Of course, there's all the sponsors, you, the listeners, God, number one, just everybody.
[02:42:33.346 --> 02:42:46.856]  It is just so good to be in this community with you, so good to have all the support and to see your feedback and your intellect and the ideas you give me and to interface and to collaborate with all of you in liberty and freedom.
[02:42:47.376 --> 02:42:48.737]  My life is so enriched.
[02:42:49.097 --> 02:42:50.599]  I'm really a big sweet teddy bear, folks.
[02:42:50.619 --> 02:42:56.803]  That's why I get angry, I growl my teeth, you know, I get really just, because I feel so threatened by the New World Order.
[02:42:57.483 --> 02:43:00.105]  You know, they'll tell you the meanest people around are the guys that are sweethearts.
[02:43:00.365 --> 02:43:01.846]  You know, you have that dual side.
[02:43:02.827 --> 02:43:04.008]  That's just how mammals are.
[02:43:04.028 --> 02:43:07.030]  I mean, we're real sweet and love our pack, but we don't like people that attack us.
[02:43:07.811 --> 02:43:09.352]  And you are my pack.
[02:43:09.392 --> 02:43:10.253]  You are my tribe.
[02:43:10.313 --> 02:43:16.417]  Black, white, old, young, Hispanic, Asian, North, South, East, West, Chinese, Mexican, it doesn't matter.
[02:43:16.677 --> 02:43:19.720]  If you love liberty and hate tyranny, I am your brother.
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:24.163]  We are all, you know, in this together, fighting together against tyranny.
[02:43:25.736 --> 02:43:28.359]  And that's why, again, the sponsors make it possible.
[02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:35.325]  It's very expensive to do what I do, and to have 12 employees, and all the bandwidth, and we're having more and more expenses now because we're victims of our own success.
[02:43:36.226 --> 02:43:40.791]  And that's why we have the great sponsors that we do have, and they're so key to all of this.
[02:43:41.191 --> 02:43:44.734]  And stations like 1330 now, out of Cameron, Texas, picking up the show.
[02:43:45.055 --> 02:43:46.076]  We're so thankful to them.
[02:43:46.176 --> 02:43:50.520]  Everybody listening to that station, or anybody who can tune into it in the Central Texas area, tell everybody about it.
[02:43:51.255 --> 02:43:52.696]  Just help us reach more people.
[02:43:52.756 --> 02:43:53.877]  Together we can.
[02:43:54.457 --> 02:43:59.040]  Now, speaking of together moving forward, I just bought a little more gold last week.
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:00.581]  And every few months I buy a few coins.
[02:44:01.221 --> 02:44:02.482]  And these are the kind of coins I get.
[02:44:03.883 --> 02:44:07.144]  And I told you about gold that was $3.20 an ounce five, six years ago.
[02:44:07.245 --> 02:44:09.906]  Now, you know, it's gone over $700, back down to $660, $670.
[02:44:10.466 --> 02:44:11.907]  That's a great time to buy.
[02:44:12.087 --> 02:44:13.067]  I'm buying gold right now.
[02:44:13.107 --> 02:44:14.308]  A few coins here, a few coins there.
[02:44:14.708 --> 02:44:18.349]  Put some in the deposit box, bury some out in the farmyard, wherever.
[02:44:18.449 --> 02:44:21.851]  Just the dollars being devalued, we're in very uncertain times.
[02:44:22.251 --> 02:44:23.252]  You cannot go wrong.
[02:44:23.292 --> 02:44:24.672]  I mean, let's say gold goes down by 20%.
[02:44:25.212 --> 02:44:27.854]  It's going to go back up in a year, but we all know it isn't going to go down.
[02:44:28.234 --> 02:44:30.895]  It's just going up and up and up on the graph, more than doubled.
[02:44:32.058 --> 02:44:34.827]  Did the stock market do that for you?
[02:44:34.927 --> 02:44:35.489]  No, it didn't.
[02:44:36.772 --> 02:44:41.354]  And Ted Anderson, waiting in the wings up at the network, I said, come on the show today.
[02:44:41.374 --> 02:44:42.235]  I had you on last week.
[02:44:42.295 --> 02:44:43.515]  Usually you're on every four months.
[02:44:43.876 --> 02:44:48.058]  Come back on because Ron Paul is talking about the stock market will collapse.
[02:44:48.078 --> 02:44:48.998]  The question is when.
[02:44:49.018 --> 02:44:51.299]  And I said, Ted, give them a really great deal again.
[02:44:51.339 --> 02:44:53.280]  And I said, what are the deals you've got for me?
[02:44:53.320 --> 02:44:54.601]  I might buy a corn or two again.
[02:44:55.141 --> 02:44:56.081]  And you've got francs.
[02:44:56.201 --> 02:44:57.182]  You've got French francs.
[02:44:57.662 --> 02:44:59.403]  You've got Swiss francs.
[02:44:59.423 --> 02:45:00.383]  You've got German francs.
[02:45:00.403 --> 02:45:00.844]  These are from the 1900s.
[02:45:00.864 --> 02:45:01.584]  You're getting these near melt
[02:45:04.285 --> 02:45:08.986]  With substantive numismatic collector value, basically for free.
[02:45:09.546 --> 02:45:12.067]  You're getting them very close to melt, very close to spot.
[02:45:12.967 --> 02:45:16.928]  You know, I mean, we're talking, what is it, like five, ten dollars you make on a coin?
[02:45:17.008 --> 02:45:19.108]  I mean, these are giveaway deals, Tim.
[02:45:19.508 --> 02:45:27.410]  You know, Alex, we've been talking about the gold coins, and it's very important to have close to melt value gold coins when the stock market's collapsing and the world is
[02:45:28.191 --> 02:45:28.611]  I think?
[02:45:44.654 --> 02:45:45.175]  I think so.
[02:46:07.837 --> 02:46:16.403]  Buy into oil, guns, I mean cooking oil, buy into paying off debts, buy into having real tangible things, bullets, whatever.
[02:46:16.503 --> 02:46:22.047]  I'm telling you folks, the dollar is going in the toilet and you're nuts if you don't move into precious metals.
[02:46:22.982 --> 02:46:25.663]  I can't see any reason why anybody wouldn't nowadays.
[02:46:25.703 --> 02:46:27.103]  There's just no argument left.
[02:46:27.163 --> 02:46:32.625]  I've always heard it from people, oh, the stock market's better than gold in the paper, and I haven't seen gold do a thing.
[02:46:32.665 --> 02:46:35.265]  Well, gold has more than doubled in the last five years.
[02:46:35.905 --> 02:46:38.746]  And that's with public admission of them trying to suppress it.
[02:46:38.806 --> 02:46:49.749]  The only reason it went down last week, which was a buying opportunity, and I'm glad people are taking advantage of it, is because all these traders are having to dump their gold portfolios on trades that went bad.
[02:46:50.369 --> 02:46:55.914]  Exactly, and that's why I think the Swiss franc and the German franc and the French franc, it's a good way to get in.
[02:46:55.974 --> 02:46:57.295]  It's an older coin.
[02:46:57.615 --> 02:47:00.377]  Like you say, it has some numismatic value to it as well.
[02:47:01.258 --> 02:47:04.020]  And we're selling them for $143 a coin.
[02:47:05.061 --> 02:47:08.303]  And that's just a great way to be getting involved in the gold.
[02:47:08.363 --> 02:47:09.564]  It's a small piece of gold.
[02:47:09.604 --> 02:47:11.486]  We did the British Sovereign last time.
[02:47:12.066 --> 02:47:17.313]  You know, we sold so many darn coins right now that I couldn't even dare touch that coin.
[02:47:17.353 --> 02:47:19.976]  Now, the franc is, of course, the French franc.
[02:47:20.036 --> 02:47:22.639]  Yeah, you sold out of the coins that you had, so now you're out.
[02:47:22.759 --> 02:47:28.626]  But folks, some of the gold shops in Austin, I've got employees that try to go down when they get their check to buy a coin or something, and they're out.
[02:47:28.966 --> 02:47:31.689]  I mean, people are grabbing gold up with both hands right now.
[02:47:31.949 --> 02:47:34.271]  You better call Midas Resources.
[02:47:34.491 --> 02:47:35.132]  Tell them about the deal.
[02:47:35.152 --> 02:47:36.033]  Give them the number, Ted.
[02:47:36.053 --> 02:47:37.154]  Yeah, the frank, it's 143.
[02:47:38.115 --> 02:47:38.996]  You can call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:47:39.016 --> 02:47:40.297]  I'm going to say it a little slower.
[02:47:40.317 --> 02:47:40.377]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:47:40.477 --> 02:47:41.418]  Man, batten down the hatches.
[02:47:41.458 --> 02:47:42.379]  Get some financial insurance.
[02:47:50.456 --> 02:47:51.637]  The flood is coming.
[02:47:51.678 --> 02:47:53.279]  The fire is at your doorstep.
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:54.721]  You need it now.
[02:47:54.901 --> 02:47:55.702]  It's not later.
[02:47:55.862 --> 02:47:58.005]  It's now.
[02:47:58.205 --> 02:48:03.391]  $143 a coin is a great value and you can call us at 800-686-2237.
[02:48:03.691 --> 02:48:06.814]  We'll be happy to handle your orders whether if it's one or you want a hundred.
[02:48:06.834 --> 02:48:07.295]  It doesn't matter.
[02:48:07.715 --> 02:48:07.955]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:08.056 --> 02:48:13.839]  And folks, even if you can only afford two or three coins every few months, that's what I do.
[02:48:13.879 --> 02:48:14.900]  Over time, that builds up.
[02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:16.841]  And the point is, it's a nest egg.
[02:48:16.902 --> 02:48:18.343]  I mean, I got a year's supply of food.
[02:48:18.643 --> 02:48:20.104]  I got a little bag of gold.
[02:48:20.424 --> 02:48:21.725]  I got guns to defend it.
[02:48:22.065 --> 02:48:23.926]  And it doesn't mean I believe all that's going to happen.
[02:48:23.966 --> 02:48:27.088]  It means if there's a good chance of it happening, you bet I'm going to be prepared.
[02:48:27.409 --> 02:48:32.092]  And if there is a really good chance of it happening, or even any chance, you've got to be prepared.
[02:48:32.532 --> 02:48:33.153]  I'm telling you.
[02:48:33.193 --> 02:48:36.236]  Plus, it's an investment that is accruing value, not losing it.
[02:48:36.517 --> 02:48:37.758]  It's a win-win-win-win-win.
[02:48:37.798 --> 02:48:38.779]  That's what I bring my listeners.
[02:48:39.140 --> 02:48:43.625]  Not miracle cures and baloney like that, but real issues.
[02:48:49.022 --> 02:48:54.508]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.869 --> 02:49:02.517]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.194 --> 02:49:10.257]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.657 --> 02:49:22.102]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.382 --> 02:49:25.864]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.364 --> 02:49:28.285]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.625 --> 02:49:32.467]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:45.931 --> 02:50:48.293]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[02:50:48.833 --> 02:50:50.314]  After a pedicure, they look great.
[02:50:50.654 --> 02:50:54.497]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[02:50:54.937 --> 02:50:57.118]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[02:50:57.559 --> 02:51:00.901]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:51:01.281 --> 02:51:03.763]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:51:04.263 --> 02:51:05.304]  What's that name again?
[02:51:05.704 --> 02:51:06.885]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:51:07.265 --> 02:51:08.426]  It's CalX.
[02:51:08.846 --> 02:51:10.687]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[02:51:11.028 --> 02:51:12.889]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[02:51:13.661 --> 02:51:22.263]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:51:22.703 --> 02:51:28.425]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[02:51:28.805 --> 02:51:39.908]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:51:40.606 --> 02:51:41.706]  Hey, here's a drugstore.
[02:51:42.026 --> 02:51:42.706]  I'll be right back.
[02:51:42.806 --> 02:51:44.567]  I'm getting some callux for my heels.
[02:51:50.388 --> 02:52:03.371]  Tell me folks, come on, make the way to fly.
[02:52:07.600 --> 02:52:11.521]  I don't know about you folks, but with the little bit of money I got in the bank, I am transferring it out.
[02:52:13.382 --> 02:52:16.363]  And I'm seeing these comments on our message board, that'll cause a run.
[02:52:16.383 --> 02:52:18.464]  That'll cause what you're saying happening.
[02:52:18.504 --> 02:52:19.304]  It's your fault!
[02:52:19.665 --> 02:52:20.925]  No, I'm not the Federal Reserve.
[02:52:20.965 --> 02:52:22.606]  I didn't pump up the currency like this.
[02:52:23.166 --> 02:52:24.526]  I didn't take over this nation.
[02:52:24.586 --> 02:52:25.787]  I didn't set up these scams.
[02:52:26.107 --> 02:52:27.768]  I didn't set up fractional reserve banking.
[02:52:28.008 --> 02:52:31.509]  I didn't take lawful money out of circulation and then cause inflation.
[02:52:32.526 --> 02:52:33.587]  I love you yuppies, man.
[02:52:33.627 --> 02:52:36.068]  You'll worship your New World Order masters right down to the end.
[02:52:36.608 --> 02:52:38.229]  By the way, they plan to blow up the economy.
[02:52:38.249 --> 02:52:39.730]  They're just meant to have it gradual.
[02:52:39.750 --> 02:52:41.711]  The Financial Times of London calls the shots.
[02:52:42.271 --> 02:52:43.972]  They basically trumpet what's going to happen.
[02:52:44.352 --> 02:52:57.018]  And a year and a half ago, I read on air, I spent weeks on that story, where they said, well, the elite, the financial elite, have decided to bring America down to third world status slowly over the next five years, but many experts worry at the IMF and World Bank and Ex-Im Bank,
[02:52:57.538 --> 02:53:01.999]  And Bank of International Settlements, that it's going to crash, and that there'll be that rush to the door.
[02:53:02.380 --> 02:53:06.001]  The challenge is the gradual de-evolution of the U.S.
[02:53:06.041 --> 02:53:11.622]  currency, and then what will Americans do when they realize they're now a third world nation?
[02:53:14.623 --> 02:53:18.424]  But in a sick way, all these yuppies and people kind of deserve it, don't they?
[02:53:19.505 --> 02:53:22.105]  Don't they kind of deserve it, knowing that we're all going to get hurt by it?
[02:53:22.485 --> 02:53:23.046]  It's sick!
[02:53:23.526 --> 02:53:24.086]  It's sick!
[02:53:25.024 --> 02:53:28.065]  And Ted Anderson, I didn't mean to make you whole and keep you over and all this.
[02:53:28.426 --> 02:53:29.846]  Point is, you've got some really good Franks.
[02:53:30.026 --> 02:53:30.947]  It's a great deal.
[02:53:31.747 --> 02:53:35.909]  Give them the number for people to call and get these coins that you have that you can ship out to them.
[02:53:36.189 --> 02:53:36.909]  It's simple.
[02:53:36.929 --> 02:53:37.130]  800-686-2237.
[02:53:37.150 --> 02:53:37.650]  Again, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:53:37.670 --> 02:53:39.931]  Just ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[02:53:39.951 --> 02:53:40.531]  It's the Frank coin.
[02:53:40.611 --> 02:53:43.873]  It's a coin that was manufactured either in France, Switzerland,
[02:53:53.417 --> 02:53:56.079]  Yeah.
[02:53:56.320 --> 02:53:59.962]  And the thing is that right now you need to be moving out of paper into gold.
[02:54:00.183 --> 02:54:01.123]  And you're exactly right.
[02:54:01.464 --> 02:54:06.788]  People are going to be blaming the people who are selling gold for the reason why the market is falling.
[02:54:06.808 --> 02:54:08.089]  Oh yeah, they always do.
[02:54:08.149 --> 02:54:08.769]  That's what they did.
[02:54:08.889 --> 02:54:12.552]  That's like blaming a firefighter in a burning house trying to save a child from the fire.
[02:54:12.792 --> 02:54:13.513]  Right, exactly.
[02:54:14.374 --> 02:54:16.916]  Franklin Delano Roosevelt did it in 1933.
[02:54:16.976 --> 02:54:21.299]  The banks were saying if it wasn't for the people trying to drive their money out of the bank, we wouldn't have a problem right now.
[02:54:21.679 --> 02:54:24.421]  And that's why Franklin Delano Roosevelt confiscated gold in 1933.
[02:54:25.401 --> 02:54:31.564]  And it turned out, of course, that it had been the bankers that designed it themselves and restricted money supply.
[02:54:31.704 --> 02:54:32.525]  It was the Fed.
[02:54:32.565 --> 02:54:36.387]  The Fed created the roaring 20s and the crash in the 1930s.
[02:54:36.447 --> 02:54:38.708]  They caused the problem.
[02:54:38.748 --> 02:54:40.109]  They create the situation.
[02:54:40.129 --> 02:54:42.030]  And then they are going to parade around and blame us.
[02:54:42.370 --> 02:54:42.950]  Ted Anderson, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:42.970 --> 02:54:43.050]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:43.070 --> 02:54:45.472]  Thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:54:50.014 --> 02:54:55.218]  Hey, thanks a lot for having me up, Alex, and I just want to say also it's a big loss that we lost Aaron Russo.
[02:54:55.258 --> 02:54:58.881]  We will have that link if she's going to put on the memorial.
[02:54:58.901 --> 02:55:00.282]  We'll have it up on GCN Live.
[02:55:00.322 --> 02:55:01.683]  I'm sure you'll have it on InfoWars.
[02:55:01.783 --> 02:55:02.023]  Good.
[02:55:02.083 --> 02:55:02.684]  Thank you, Ted.
[02:55:02.704 --> 02:55:04.385]  All right, thanks for having me up.
[02:55:04.445 --> 02:55:05.726]  I appreciate it.
[02:55:05.746 --> 02:55:06.066]  You bet.
[02:55:06.086 --> 02:55:07.467]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:55:07.908 --> 02:55:08.848]  I'm out of time for today.
[02:55:08.908 --> 02:55:10.350]  I want to take more of your calls tomorrow.
[02:55:10.390 --> 02:55:11.430]  We didn't get the calls today.
[02:55:11.450 --> 02:55:14.773]  We have a lot of other big guests coming up in the two days we've got left this week.
[02:55:18.047 --> 02:55:23.808]  I mean, I try to bring you things that I think are important and things that I think you need and things that I do.
[02:55:24.468 --> 02:55:26.789]  Not that I'm a genius, but it's just basic stuff.
[02:55:27.409 --> 02:55:29.149]  I try not to eat processed foods.
[02:55:29.830 --> 02:55:31.210]  I try to drink filtered water.
[02:55:31.810 --> 02:55:33.030]  I try to have some gold.
[02:55:33.830 --> 02:55:37.231]  I try to get the Bill of Rights back so we don't live in a police state.
[02:55:38.451 --> 02:55:40.072]  And it's really that simple.
[02:55:40.112 --> 02:55:40.912]  I hope you give them a call.
[02:55:41.514 --> 02:55:43.796]  And I hope you give Big Berkey a call, too.
[02:55:43.816 --> 02:55:47.139]  If you've been procrastinating on water filters, folks, the poison's in the water now.
[02:55:47.199 --> 02:55:48.120]  You need to clean it out.
[02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:51.623]  888-803-4438 on those filters.
[02:55:51.643 --> 02:55:52.604]  888-803-4438.
[02:55:53.465 --> 02:55:57.048]  Or at Infowars.com, you get the filters right there as well.
[02:55:57.949 --> 02:55:59.991]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[02:56:00.071 --> 02:56:03.654]  Now is the time to get ready in every way, in case something bad happens.
[02:56:04.366 --> 02:56:12.150]  I know everything's wonderful right now, like the media says, but it actually isn't, so... And then, hope for the best, prepare for the worst, as they say.
[02:56:12.730 --> 02:56:17.693]  Alright, if you missed the first or second hour of the show, it's about to restart again at mfowards.com.
[02:56:17.733 --> 02:56:21.975]  You can listen on the web, or if not, we'll see you back at the same station, same time tomorrow.
[02:56:22.235 --> 02:56:22.716]  God bless.
[02:56:25.577 --> 02:56:30.160]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[02:56:36.137 --> 02:56:36.200]  Yes.
