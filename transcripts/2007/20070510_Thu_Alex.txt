[00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.406]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.146]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.847 --> 00:00:09.967]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.607 --> 00:00:11.408]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.168 --> 00:00:13.128]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:17.550]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.991]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.731]  Welcome, welcome, welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:32.453]  It is already the 10th day of May, 2007.
[00:00:33.713 --> 00:00:37.015]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:40.357]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:40.437 --> 00:00:48.202]  Coming up, we're going to have a little five-minute update from Reverend Ted Pike on the state of the First Amendment killing
[00:00:49.093 --> 00:00:52.134]  hate bill that's in the House and the Senate right now.
[00:00:52.834 --> 00:01:03.096]  Then we're going to be joined by Jim Mars, who is one of the preeminent experts on the JFK government-sponsored assassination 43 and a half years ago.
[00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:10.637]  He'll be joining us to go over all the latest developments with E. Howard Hunt, who he's always fingered as being involved.
[00:01:11.217 --> 00:01:14.038]  Now his son going public with the written pages and the tape
[00:01:14.538 --> 00:01:15.379]  We're good to go.
[00:01:35.057 --> 00:01:35.517]  Yes, we are.
[00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.532]  I got on Hannity and Combs last night.
[00:01:56.552 --> 00:02:16.805]  I've never seen Combs acting more as Newshounds called it properly, brutish, really under the fox heat, calling us all sorts of names and trying to spin what was really said by Kerry a few weeks ago here in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:18.436 --> 00:02:19.818]  So that is coming up.
[00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:23.003]  We'll be playing that in this hour.
[00:02:23.484 --> 00:02:26.509]  We have several other important audio clips as well for you.
[00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:31.206]  Giuliani set to fully embrace abortion.
[00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:34.247]  He will definitely get a lot of Republican support with that move.
[00:02:34.307 --> 00:02:35.487]  Anything anti-America.
[00:02:35.927 --> 00:02:37.327]  He's fake conservative, support it.
[00:02:37.387 --> 00:02:39.068]  Open borders, gun control, abortion.
[00:02:39.488 --> 00:02:40.208]  It's the new way.
[00:02:40.248 --> 00:02:41.788]  Of course, I'm being somewhat sarcastic.
[00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.849]  That leads me to the article written by Paul Watson that I commissioned yesterday.
[00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:46.590]  It's excellent.
[00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.090]  I hope you get it to the four wins.
[00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.411]  Only Ron Paul can defeat Hillary Clinton.
[00:02:53.763 --> 00:03:02.812]  The Republican camp is completely discredited and hated by conservatives in the country, and libertarians, and of course, mainline progressives and liberals.
[00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:07.408]  But everybody across the political spectrum respects Ron Paul.
[00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:09.209]  He is a constitutionalist.
[00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:10.651]  I don't have to tell you, the listeners, that.
[00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:20.380]  But still a lot of mainline conservatives haven't woken up to this fact completely, that everybody else is a dead duck, which is exactly what the RNC wants.
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.721]  They just share power.
[00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:24.744]  It's time to pass the baton to the trusted Clintons.
[00:03:25.344 --> 00:03:27.726]  Only Ron Paul can defeat Hillary Clinton.
[00:03:28.227 --> 00:03:29.228]  We have News Corp.
[00:03:30.257 --> 00:03:33.398]  Firmly promoting and doing fundraisers behind Hillary.
[00:03:33.478 --> 00:03:35.980]  I've seen them with horror the last year.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.220]  Softened towards her.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.282]  Rupert Murdoch just went public saying he believes in man-made global warming.
[00:03:41.582 --> 00:03:42.722]  He's for a global tax.
[00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:44.223]  I have that in the stack today.
[00:03:44.703 --> 00:03:55.688]  We are in a deadly crisis with Fox News on one side, the Clintons on the other, in a vicious, treacherous, pincer attack against the American people.
[00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:57.887]  And against the people of the world.
[00:03:57.927 --> 00:03:59.168]  We've got to get the word out.
[00:03:59.568 --> 00:04:03.310]  Fox News is behind the Clintons.
[00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:22.940]  Now, it'll be too late, probably, but by the time conservatives can actually believe this, by the time they finally figure out they've been betrayed, and that they've been manipulated and played, and it happens to the best of us, by the time you wake up to this incredibly complex treachery, it may just be too late, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:32.195]  I don't like being played, and I was played, you know, 15 years ago as being a little Republican, but I woke up to that 12, 13 years ago.
[00:04:33.016 --> 00:04:34.397]  And it's time for you to wake up.
[00:04:34.537 --> 00:04:37.019]  The Clintons and the Bushes, narcotics traffic together.
[00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.840]  They've been CIA going way back to Clinton.
[00:04:40.461 --> 00:04:41.621]  Went right out of high school.
[00:04:42.002 --> 00:04:43.403]  This is completely staged.
[00:04:43.943 --> 00:04:45.544]  Fox News is a black op.
[00:04:45.964 --> 00:04:47.885]  We'll go over all of it when we get back.
[00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:51.267]  And the greening of Fox News and much more.
[00:04:51.348 --> 00:04:51.788]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.542 --> 00:05:05.082]  It's here!
[00:05:05.242 --> 00:05:10.025]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.405 --> 00:05:18.009]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.726 --> 00:05:25.788]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:37.612]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.912 --> 00:05:41.394]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.854 --> 00:05:43.814]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:47.916]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.615 --> 00:06:05.176]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:06:05.236 --> 00:06:05.736]  are located?

[00:07:01.224 --> 00:07:05.508]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:07:05.748 --> 00:07:10.592]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:10.853 --> 00:07:12.214]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:12.374 --> 00:07:15.717]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.091]  No animal testing.
[00:07:37.351 --> 00:07:38.651]  I use them and love them.
[00:07:38.671 --> 00:07:40.272]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.

[00:08:16.067 --> 00:08:20.736]  So many tears we have lost once before.
[00:08:21.116 --> 00:08:27.208]  Now we'll settle the score when our cannons will roar.
[00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:28.430]  Revolution!
[00:08:48.747 --> 00:08:49.809]  We're good to go.
[00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:29.594]  There is so much news to cover here again ladies and gentlemen for those that just joined us
[00:09:49.737 --> 00:10:00.125]  I am going to be having, well coming up in the second hour we're going to have Jim Meyers spawn talking about all the big new developments concerning the JFK assassination.
[00:10:00.606 --> 00:10:13.896]  Remember last week and the week before that the news came out, in fact it was just a week ago, about a week and a half ago and we've already pretty much forgotten and glazed over it, that the son of E. Howard Hunt
[00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:20.329]  released the audio tape and the handwritten pages and did a valiant interview.
[00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:21.650]  He'll be joining us on Monday.
[00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:22.510]  St.
[00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.091]  John Hunt.
[00:10:26.832 --> 00:10:27.152]  St.
[00:10:27.352 --> 00:10:28.353]  John Hunt.
[00:10:29.433 --> 00:10:42.398]  The son of E. Howard Hunt, the CIA Section Chief Black Op Commander who overthrew multiple nations from Guatemala to the failed Bay of Pigs to what happened with the Watergate burglars.
[00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:43.699]  He was the head honcho on that.
[00:10:45.274 --> 00:10:56.841]  One of the head honchos on the Kennedy assassination, and there it is, publicly admitted, fits in with all of our decades of research, and we've kind of just glazed over it now.
[00:10:56.921 --> 00:10:59.082]  The mainstream media wouldn't touch it.
[00:11:00.603 --> 00:11:13.130]  The cover of the Rolling Stone a month ago did mention the written pages and kind of obliquely covered it from a side angle, but still poo-pooed certain areas.
[00:11:13.937 --> 00:11:19.740]  Kind of attempted in a half-hearted, uh, anemic way to discredit it, but they couldn't.
[00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:33.667]  But nothing on 60 Minutes, nothing on CNN, nothing on History Channel, nothing anywhere, ladies and gentlemen, only small pockets of alternative talk radio and the growing Internet.
[00:11:34.007 --> 00:11:34.807]  That's the good news.
[00:11:34.867 --> 00:11:39.309]  Ten, twenty years ago, they had the monopoly.
[00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.731]  They had it all.
[00:11:42.893 --> 00:11:45.776]  And now they don't have that monopoly anymore.
[00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:49.640]  So that is coming up.
[00:11:51.101 --> 00:12:03.594]  And then David Ray Griffin in the third hour will have a brief update coming up here in about 20 minutes from Ted Pike on where the free speech attacking, destroying, annihilating, decimating,
[00:12:04.995 --> 00:12:12.436]  Legislation is on the hate crimes, and I know every few months we talk about this, sometimes even every few weeks, because they're constantly assaulting us.
[00:12:12.456 --> 00:12:14.877]  They count on us to finally just give up.
[00:12:16.497 --> 00:12:27.039]  On the microchipping, on the open borders, on the gun control, on the Ritalin and Prozacing of our population, we have to say, no, we're not going to give up.
[00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:30.639]  In fact, we're only going to intensify, and we're never going to stop.
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.000]  It's like a tennis game.
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.220]  We've just got to get into it,
[00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:35.916]  Get your adrenaline up.
[00:12:35.936 --> 00:12:37.276]  Know you're going to win.
[00:12:37.376 --> 00:12:38.237]  Quit hesitating.
[00:12:38.277 --> 00:12:39.937]  Quit thinking about it and just take action.
[00:12:42.239 --> 00:12:43.939]  And then we're going to win this game.
[00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:44.920]  We're going to win this fight.
[00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:50.422]  But it's really just that simple.
[00:12:54.404 --> 00:12:56.145]  Let me go ahead and get into this Ron Paul news.
[00:12:56.185 --> 00:12:58.967]  I know we've been leading the broadcast almost every day now with Ron Paul.
[00:13:00.927 --> 00:13:01.668]  And that's because
[00:13:05.337 --> 00:13:07.998]  In 1993, it was a staged event.
[00:13:08.518 --> 00:13:20.342]  Really, what you had was Ross Perot, who'd made billions off of government contracts, who I don't trust two inches, and that's a whole area of discussion.
[00:13:21.642 --> 00:13:25.724]  I mean, in 1992-93, I supported Ross Perot.
[00:13:27.664 --> 00:13:31.266]  I supported Ross Perot right as I was getting out of high school into college.
[00:13:31.306 --> 00:13:32.186]  That's how young I am.
[00:13:34.409 --> 00:13:46.994]  And I supported him, and then later I found out that he'd been in business with the Clintons, and I found out that all he was doing was attacking George Bush Sr., and that at a larger level, George Bush Sr.
[00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:53.796]  was well aware of the whole thing, and it was nothing but a dog-and-pony show to ensure that he sucked enough conservative votes
[00:13:54.586 --> 00:13:58.330]  Uh, that Bill Clinton got into office, not because it even mattered.
[00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:58.951]  Bush Sr.
[00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:06.780]  and Clinton worked overtly in business together, and CIA operatives together, but that it was important theater for the country.
[00:14:07.705 --> 00:14:13.748]  And that they wanted Clinton in because he could carry the ball because he was fresh in the game.
[00:14:14.489 --> 00:14:16.109]  They're on the same team, folks.
[00:14:16.149 --> 00:14:17.390]  They just put in a new player.
[00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:36.840]  When they pull one quarterback or one running back or one linebacker or one nose guard out of the game or one tackle, when they pull them out of the game and they send in somebody fresh, when they send in a fresh player, that's not a new team, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:37.612 --> 00:14:38.012]  Okay?
[00:14:38.492 --> 00:14:40.173]  That is the exact same people.
[00:14:40.293 --> 00:14:45.255]  And as soon as the public realizes this, we can set about saving this country.
[00:14:46.615 --> 00:14:57.560]  Now, the public has picked up on this to a certain degree now, and they know that they basically ran a corpse, Bob Dole, against Bill Clinton in 96, and he never really ran.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.600]  That was a staged event.
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:06.223]  Because Clinton was a weak figure, and they couldn't run anybody strong against him, so that was another staged event.
[00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:10.351]  And the same thing happened in 2000.
[00:15:10.391 --> 00:15:22.955]  They ran Mr. New World Order, Mr. Global Tax, Mr. Man May Global Warming against Mr. Skull and Bones from Kenny Budport, Maine.
[00:15:23.915 --> 00:15:30.097]  And, of course, the people didn't vote the way they wanted them to in handing the baton.
[00:15:30.577 --> 00:15:32.698]  And so Al Gore properly conceded
[00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:39.735]  And then in 2004, they had another show election with John F. Kerry.
[00:15:40.636 --> 00:15:45.360]  And again, you can't just steal elections in Ohio and New Mexico and many other areas.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.302]  You have to also have the boxer take a dive.
[00:15:49.143 --> 00:15:55.328]  And again, most of you now know that Don King sponsored boxing has a good chance of being staged.
[00:15:56.369 --> 00:15:59.191]  And most of you know that there's a lot of chicanery.
[00:15:59.893 --> 00:16:02.974]  and skullduggery going on in horse racing.
[00:16:03.294 --> 00:16:12.036]  A lot of drugging and a lot of people holding horses back and a lot of, you know, fifty million dollar a piece bets riding with Arab sheiks and royalty there.
[00:16:13.156 --> 00:16:18.018]  All betting, in some cases again, it's been reported some bets have been over fifty mil.
[00:16:20.098 --> 00:16:23.359]  And when something's that big, you can bet there's going to be chicanery involved.
[00:16:24.548 --> 00:16:28.613]  And it's come out with the rigging of baseball and manipulation of football.
[00:16:29.013 --> 00:16:32.818]  Only in key plays on key games, ladies and gentlemen, with key players.
[00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:40.767]  Well, I assure you that all the rigging in the world has nothing on politics.
[00:16:41.761 --> 00:16:46.702]  Remember in Taiwan when the leader was about to get kicked out so he staged a shooting of himself?
[00:16:47.143 --> 00:16:47.943]  Then that came out.
[00:16:47.963 --> 00:16:51.404]  It was headline news but didn't become a big part of the news cycle.
[00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:55.845]  I mean, they do all sorts of stuff, is the point I'm trying to make here.
[00:16:56.445 --> 00:17:06.928]  And we can forensically track what they're doing and learn what they're doing and understand how they're stealing elections, how they're manipulating the public mind.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.141]  And there's no doubt that Ron Paul is the real deal.
[00:17:12.641 --> 00:17:17.863]  There's no doubt that in my lifetime, nothing this real has come along.
[00:17:17.923 --> 00:17:30.546]  I mean, you could say that Ronald Reagan was an actor, and he was controlled by globalists, but he was his own man, and he really did want to cut taxes, and he was certainly handled.
[00:17:30.606 --> 00:17:32.667]  I wouldn't say he himself was evil.
[00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:38.694]  And we know that he said horrible things, which were true, about George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:17:38.754 --> 00:17:48.963]  It's been in the news, but we've had big heavyweight Republicans on here who heard it said, who saw the speeches, and saw what happened at the 1980 convention, where Bush Sr., in 76, and then again
[00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:55.685]  We're good to go.
[00:18:20.592 --> 00:18:26.855]  And Reagan went around and then they told Reagan, you're not going to get this nomination unless you put as VP, H.W.
[00:18:26.895 --> 00:18:27.215]  Bush.
[00:18:28.635 --> 00:18:29.015]  Okay?
[00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:31.877]  George Herbert Walker, Mr. former CIA.
[00:18:34.078 --> 00:18:39.420]  And sure enough, Reagan got in there and within a year, the Secret Service didn't protect him, did they?
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:45.462]  No, they were sure that he got put in that car and got a bullet put in him.
[00:18:45.782 --> 00:18:47.343]  And Reagan was never the same after that.
[00:18:48.906 --> 00:18:50.989]  Ron Paul has borne the fruits.
[00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:57.216]  He has made the right votes, done the right things, given the right speeches, never deviated from that.
[00:18:57.617 --> 00:18:58.778]  The proof is in the pudding.
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:08.230]  He did a great job in the debate and stood on his principles, and he won the debate in every major scientific and unscientific poll.
[00:19:09.286 --> 00:19:16.069]  He has the highest web traffic numbers indexed by Alexa and other sites of anybody in the field.
[00:19:16.769 --> 00:19:18.770]  He is now preeminent.
[00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.031]  He is preeminent.
[00:19:21.131 --> 00:19:22.832]  He is the Republican candidate.
[00:19:23.152 --> 00:19:27.293]  He should be the nominee, and he would beat Hillary Clinton.
[00:19:28.134 --> 00:19:33.296]  We are seeing something phenomenal happen here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:33.979 --> 00:19:36.960]  And that's why I get mad at people who have bad attitudes and say this can't happen.
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.661]  I know they've got election fraud in place.
[00:19:39.322 --> 00:19:43.704]  I know that there is... It's very hard for him to win, but you know what?
[00:19:43.744 --> 00:19:46.585]  People do win in sudden death over time.
[00:19:47.125 --> 00:19:49.586]  And believe me, folks, we need a Hail Mary right now.
[00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:53.648]  I think this is God giving us a chance for a reprieve.
[00:19:54.229 --> 00:20:00.912]  Ron Paul... Well, we'll detail it for one more segment on the other side, then get into all the other news and play some clips.
[00:20:02.856 --> 00:20:04.918]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:14.487]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.908 --> 00:20:22.115]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.828 --> 00:20:26.693]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMed Inc.'
[00:20:26.673 --> 00:20:28.334]  's patented methodology.

[00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:04.580]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.681]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:22:07.961 --> 00:22:12.104]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:22:12.544 --> 00:22:13.364]  So what do you do?
[00:22:13.684 --> 00:22:18.247]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:22:18.747 --> 00:22:20.869]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:23:02.297 --> 00:23:03.458]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:23:03.578 --> 00:23:05.859]  of the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:23:05.979 --> 00:23:08.960]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:09.700]  is a real thing.
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:16.643]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:23:16.783 --> 00:23:22.045]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:22.985]  We're good to go!
[00:23:49.051 --> 00:23:53.454]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:23:53.514 --> 00:23:57.836]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[00:23:57.856 --> 00:24:00.798]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:24:10.024 --> 00:24:13.426]  Lookin' at y'all window there, does it seem you out to catch?
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:21.046]  Oh, sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.
[00:24:40.714 --> 00:24:42.154]  Welcome back.
[00:24:42.234 --> 00:24:44.295]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:24:44.435 --> 00:24:49.316]  Only Ron Paul can defeat Hillary Clinton.
[00:25:12.535 --> 00:25:20.181]  Which is why the corporate elite that have already selected the New York Senator are doing their best to blackball the Texas Congressman.
[00:25:20.762 --> 00:25:23.964]  I'm so proud of my state, folks.
[00:25:24.004 --> 00:25:34.292]  Including Yahoo, who lied by claiming Paul had not filed papers to officially run and omitted him from their website coverage.
[00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:39.937]  You notice how so much evil comes from Texas, but also so much good is coming from Texas to resist it?
[00:25:41.428 --> 00:25:46.791]  And you notice the New World Order's main push for the North American Union on multiple fronts is centering in Texas?
[00:25:48.232 --> 00:25:53.595]  And I literally was born and live, and I am right in the middle of the front line, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:53.735 --> 00:25:54.196]  I'm blessed.
[00:25:54.236 --> 00:25:56.137]  I'm right where God wants me to be, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:57.538 --> 00:26:04.302]  Ron Paul is the only Republican candidate to carry a message that resonates with the American people.
[00:26:05.002 --> 00:26:08.224]  His thoroughbred anti-war and anti-big government stance
[00:26:09.457 --> 00:26:21.870]  But the establishment press have done their level best to keep Paul in the shadows while lying and claiming that every participant featured in this week's debate was pro-war.
[00:26:22.586 --> 00:26:27.230]  Ron Paul is the only Republican candidate to have voted against the Iraq War.
[00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:40.961]  Ron Paul is the only Republican candidate who will not seek to lead the United States into a military confrontation with Iran, something also that Democrats Obama, Clinton, and Edwards have all vowed to keep on the table.
[00:26:41.301 --> 00:26:48.927]  That's right, if it gets out to the Democrats that there's a Republican who's actually anti-war and who's always voted against it,
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:56.815]  It's over, folks, because there's masses of on-the-fence conservatives and Reagan Republicans who are totally against this war.
[00:26:56.915 --> 00:27:00.201]  Over 70% of the country in Gallup poll is now against it, and growing.
[00:27:00.582 --> 00:27:01.464]  I mean, it's growing.
[00:27:03.484 --> 00:27:06.286]  We're talking upwards of 75% in the last polls I saw.
[00:27:06.326 --> 00:27:12.271]  I mean, this is unbelievable defection from the warmonger camp to the pro-freedom camp.
[00:27:12.792 --> 00:27:14.473]  So they're in a desperate situation.
[00:27:14.533 --> 00:27:23.060]  They can't let the word get out that there is a pro-gun, pro-border, pro-America, anti-corruption, anti-war candidate.
[00:27:24.521 --> 00:27:28.965]  I mean, if it gets out, which it is getting out, there's no way they can stop him.
[00:27:29.005 --> 00:27:30.806]  He's going to get millions in contributions.
[00:27:31.206 --> 00:27:33.008]  He was on three or four weeks ago with us.
[00:27:33.698 --> 00:27:37.520]  And he said on air the majority of the support he's gotten from this show.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.040]  Frankly, that's shameful.
[00:27:39.521 --> 00:27:42.402]  I talked to him off air and he said, yeah, most of the money they've gotten is from this show.
[00:27:43.342 --> 00:27:54.067]  And whereas on one side of me I'm proud of that, on the other side I'm upset because six hundred and something thousand is chicken feed for a presidential campaign.
[00:27:54.407 --> 00:27:58.569]  But even with only that much money, which is still good for no national coverage,
[00:27:59.278 --> 00:28:03.660]  And I would imagine now with the debates in the last three or four weeks, I need to get back in touch with the Congressman.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:12.105]  We're working on, he's got all new staff, on jumping through all those hoops and getting the Congressman on.
[00:28:13.105 --> 00:28:19.969]  But it is, it is, and again, I'm so busy making films and things, I can't dress up in a tuxedo.
[00:28:20.009 --> 00:28:23.570]  I'm not even going to go to that fundraiser they're having here in Austin in a few weeks.
[00:28:27.629 --> 00:28:32.631]  It is just so important that we support the congressman.
[00:28:34.211 --> 00:28:46.095]  Continuing, Ron Paul is the only Republican candidate who is not compromised, while the likes of Giuliani and Romney have more skeletons in their closets than a fancy dress boutique.
[00:28:46.695 --> 00:28:54.538]  He holds true conservative values, unlike the vehemently pro-abortion Giuliani and Romney.
[00:28:55.774 --> 00:29:08.017]  Ron Paul is the only candidate, period, who has promised to abolish the IRS and end the fraudulent fiat-based money system that is crippling America's economy while lining the pockets of the ultra-rich.
[00:29:08.637 --> 00:29:17.559]  Every other Republican candidate besides Ron Paul stands no chance of coming out on top if they go up against Hillary Clinton for the 2008 presidency.
[00:29:17.939 --> 00:29:24.081]  This is a message particularly directed at people who consider themselves conservatives despite voting for George W. Bush
[00:29:25.001 --> 00:29:31.586]  On two occasions, get behind Ron Paul or Hillary Clinton is guaranteed to be the next President of the United States.
[00:29:32.087 --> 00:29:44.217]  For all the reasons mentioned above, we are witnessing a clear agenda to marginalize and discredit Ron Paul on behalf of the corporate media, while burying the fact that he won last Thursday's debate hands down.
[00:29:44.557 --> 00:29:46.258]  The article goes on to detail all that.
[00:29:46.659 --> 00:29:48.460]  Get it out to everybody, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.662]  Get it to the mainline Dumbo conservatives.
[00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:54.945]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.845 --> 00:29:58.627]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.548 --> 00:30:07.532]  So you take care of your car, you change the oil, tune it up on a regular basis, and always make sure that it's running at its best.
[00:30:07.752 --> 00:30:10.053]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[00:30:10.353 --> 00:30:13.615]  That's why you need SFR's Protecta Synthetic Oil Treatments.
[00:30:13.835 --> 00:30:18.558]  Protecta Engine Treatment, Protecta Transmission Treatment, and Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment.
[00:30:18.838 --> 00:30:26.585]  Protecta meets the demands you put on your vehicle by providing more horsepower, improving gas mileage, decreasing emissions, and promotes longer engine life.
[00:30:26.905 --> 00:30:33.791]  Only Protecta contains a new technology, Nano-B, which is not found in any competitive additive products at your local auto parts store.
[00:30:34.052 --> 00:30:36.313]  At Protecta, we do not compromise quality.
[00:30:36.454 --> 00:30:41.198]  Because you expect the very best, we provide products that work right the first time, every time.
[00:30:41.458 --> 00:30:43.740]  So get more when you treat it right with Protecta.
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:44.181]  I think so.
[00:31:02.568 --> 00:31:04.970]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:12.273]  Did you know that one of the 45 objectives of international communism was to have America become involved in free trade?
[00:31:12.874 --> 00:31:22.759]  Without tariffs on cheaply produced foreign goods, our manufacturing base, which would not be able to compete, would be forced to move their manufacturing plants overseas or to Mexico.
[00:31:23.439 --> 00:31:29.663]  This would throw millions of workers out of work and completely destroy the middle class that has made America great.
[00:31:30.383 --> 00:31:38.028]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:32:00.598 --> 00:32:01.820]  This is Elizabeth Border.

[00:32:08.209 --> 00:32:08.770]  Concise?
[00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.691]  Hard-hitting?
[00:32:10.052 --> 00:32:12.996]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[00:32:13.337 --> 00:32:14.518]  War in Iran?

[00:33:19.378 --> 00:33:20.218]  We're here live.
[00:33:20.258 --> 00:33:22.519]  Don't forget the new free podcast.

[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.121]  But the information is always new.
[00:33:39.481 --> 00:33:52.251]  Be sure and tell everybody you know about the free subscription and get it out to them because that's how we're going to fight and win this war against the New World Order there at Infowars.com.

[00:33:57.812 --> 00:34:00.694]  Or people at your synagogue, or whatever.
[00:34:01.414 --> 00:34:05.056]  People at your VFW, your friends in college.
[00:34:05.116 --> 00:34:11.739]  Tell them, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com.
[00:34:12.019 --> 00:34:14.341]  We're about to get a quick little update from Pastor Ted Pico.
[00:34:14.401 --> 00:34:15.581]  I appreciate popping in with us.
[00:34:15.861 --> 00:34:18.102]  Before we do that, I haven't really plugged this yet on air.
[00:34:18.142 --> 00:34:22.625]  I mentioned that we were going to do a contest last week, and I thought it was Wednesday!
[00:34:22.645 --> 00:34:27.107]  I don't even have a weekend anymore, so it just all runs together.
[00:34:28.508 --> 00:34:33.551]  I was going, yeah, tomorrow's Thursday, and they go, no, no, Alex, it's Thursday now.
[00:34:34.652 --> 00:34:44.018]  You go to JonesReport.com, or go to PrisonPlanet.com, there's a link to it up on the top of the main page, but it actually resides on the JonesReport.com server.
[00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:48.393]  Push the Truth 9-1-1 Inside Job Jam.
[00:34:48.413 --> 00:34:50.035]  It's a truth jam.
[00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:59.764]  And we did this a year and a half ago with Schwarzenegger, got some great ads made that we put out there against him running for president.
[00:35:00.224 --> 00:35:01.826]  We have an example of that on the site.
[00:35:03.007 --> 00:35:09.914]  And of course you saw what Mr. Dice just did with his truth jam, John Connor.
[00:35:10.966 --> 00:35:14.428]  You can go to JonesReport.com.
[00:35:14.488 --> 00:35:20.011]  It's Push the Truth, 9-1-1 Inside Job Jam Video Action Contest.
[00:35:20.591 --> 00:35:22.592]  And we want you to post it to YouTube.
[00:35:22.612 --> 00:35:27.714]  It needs to be sent to us by no later than noon on June 12th.
[00:35:27.754 --> 00:35:29.115]  So that gives you over a month.
[00:35:29.947 --> 00:35:32.129]  And it needs to be one minute to five minutes long.
[00:35:32.669 --> 00:35:34.111]  And the rules are there.
[00:35:34.151 --> 00:35:40.596]  And it basically just needs to bring forward the fact that 9-11 is an inside job in a compelling faction.
[00:35:41.416 --> 00:35:44.219]  And of course, original video is always better.
[00:35:44.899 --> 00:35:46.020]  But it can be compilations.
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.281]  It can be whatever you want.
[00:35:47.321 --> 00:35:52.385]  It can be a combo of video that's out there combined with video you've shot.
[00:35:53.626 --> 00:35:56.729]  It can run the gamut of whatever you'd like.
[00:35:58.579 --> 00:36:01.342]  So again, as long as it gets the information out.
[00:36:01.362 --> 00:36:04.104]  Who will judge it?
[00:36:05.325 --> 00:36:06.847]  I say it closes June 12th.
[00:36:08.128 --> 00:36:11.030]  Really, I'm the judge of it, but we will be posting.
[00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:14.814]  If stuff comes in tomorrow, we'll post it on the site right through the 12th.
[00:36:14.854 --> 00:36:19.037]  It will take a few days to get your emails and comments on which one you think is the best.
[00:36:20.362 --> 00:36:25.888]  You know, the folks that work here, my colleagues, my crew, is really the proper term.
[00:36:25.928 --> 00:36:26.609]  They are a crew.
[00:36:26.629 --> 00:36:28.291]  We are a motley ship.
[00:36:29.192 --> 00:36:31.714]  And we will basically all vote on it together.
[00:36:31.734 --> 00:36:34.137]  But I'll have the, I guess, last say, the veto.
[00:36:34.497 --> 00:36:35.659]  But I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:36:35.679 --> 00:36:37.821]  No, we're generally on the same page.
[00:36:38.519 --> 00:36:45.006]  We can even have blind ballots here in the office of who thinks what's the best, and your emails will be considered on that as well.
[00:36:45.846 --> 00:36:52.913]  So again, JonesReport.com, PushTheTruth, 911InsideJob, JAM, Video Action Contest.
[00:36:53.314 --> 00:36:55.756]  You post it to YouTube or to Google.
[00:36:55.796 --> 00:37:01.182]  Those two, because they're insured platforms where we know it won't get jerked down or get too much traffic and crash.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:08.081]  And we will then post those all on the Jones Report, PrisonPlanet, and InfoWars.com.
[00:37:08.502 --> 00:37:10.782]  And then you can all give us your feedback on it.
[00:37:11.082 --> 00:37:16.203]  And we'll let you know, we'll announce by June 15th who the winners are.
[00:37:16.744 --> 00:37:31.287]  And who gets the $1,000 and 20 Terror Storms, 10 America Freedom to Fascisms, 5 Loose Change 2nd Editions, and a few other goodies for you to have for yourself and to give or sell or whatever to others.
[00:37:32.148 --> 00:37:39.579]  So we're going to up the ante on the prize money there and add in some truth ammunition into the mix.
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.703]  Alright, thank you for holding while I introduce that.
[00:37:42.364 --> 00:37:44.487]  Truthtellers.org is the website.
[00:37:44.748 --> 00:37:46.791]  He's the Reverend Ted Pike.
[00:37:47.291 --> 00:37:48.452]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[00:38:05.991 --> 00:38:08.713]  Just in a nutshell, tell us what the legislation is and what it will do.
[00:38:09.074 --> 00:38:17.600]  Some people are reading some of the flowery language in it and not reading the key hooks that are in it, and they're claiming that, oh, it isn't as bad as Ted Pike says.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:22.684]  Oh, no, the bill is actually worse than I have been saying over the past few months.
[00:38:22.744 --> 00:38:27.607]  I've been researching especially the original law that was passed in 1969.
[00:38:28.048 --> 00:38:33.412]  You see, the present federal hate bill that's now before the Senate is actually a series of amendments
[00:38:33.908 --> 00:38:34.268]  We're good to go.
[00:38:58.092 --> 00:38:58.352]  I don't
[00:39:21.167 --> 00:39:21.648]  I'm good.
[00:39:34.662 --> 00:39:40.345]  To verbally intimidate, quote-unquote intimidate, and nobody knows exactly what that means.
[00:39:40.365 --> 00:39:41.446]  Now let's be clear here.
[00:39:41.666 --> 00:39:52.232]  This was designed for an Alabama or Georgia or Oklahoma or wherever, with the Klan coming up and saying to black folks, you know, we're going to kill you if you vote.
[00:39:52.612 --> 00:40:02.718]  That's totally different than Christians kneeling and praying on a street corner saying that this is biblically wrong what you're doing, dancing around naked in the streets at an outfest.
[00:40:03.163 --> 00:40:03.823]  Well, that's right.
[00:40:03.963 --> 00:40:20.409]  Not only that, but the original civil rights law in 1969 says it's also a hate crime, a federal hate crime, to aid and abet anyone who wants to or attempts to verbally intimidate these members of the federal republic.
[00:40:20.429 --> 00:40:22.289]  And they pass the same stuff in England.
[00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:26.331]  In England, BBC headline, hundreds arrested in overnight hate raid.
[00:40:26.751 --> 00:40:28.191]  And I thought, oh boy, were they killing people?
[00:40:28.251 --> 00:40:32.613]  And I read into the article a few years ago and it said they were heard on street corners.
[00:40:33.013 --> 00:40:39.035]  Or they were in restaurants, and they pay them to sit there eating in lavish restaurants, police listening to what you say.
[00:40:39.295 --> 00:40:44.697]  Folks, this is the Soviet Union, and now they're saying, oh, we're going to arrest you if you don't say global warming's real.
[00:40:44.997 --> 00:40:47.538]  We're going to arrest you if you say the UN's bad.
[00:40:47.658 --> 00:40:50.759]  Oh, we fired and fined a minister.
[00:40:50.999 --> 00:40:52.780]  He said the EU was Nazi.
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:55.841]  You're not allowed to use that term in any connotation
[00:40:56.521 --> 00:41:06.327]  But for Jews in World War II, now they want Lou Dobbs fired, because he said the open border crowd lies like Nazi propaganda.
[00:41:06.607 --> 00:41:07.988]  And now he needs to be fired.
[00:41:08.048 --> 00:41:09.449]  See how this expands, folks?
[00:41:09.469 --> 00:41:10.669]  Yeah, you bet.
[00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:17.373]  And what this legislation does is it really puts a chill on free speech, especially for two categories of people.
[00:41:17.393 --> 00:41:21.736]  That's talk show hosts and pastors or ministers from a pulpit.
[00:41:21.776 --> 00:41:23.437]  Because, you see, if they
[00:41:24.573 --> 00:41:45.266]  Let's say you put me on and I intimidate homosexuals from thinking, well, you know, maybe since I have AIDS or I have hepatitis, I'm talking about the homosexuals, maybe that intimidates me from feeling that I as a homosexual can be hired as a counselor at a summer camp, or a P.E.
[00:41:45.386 --> 00:41:50.449]  coach, or a food handler, or even a pastor in a congregation.
[00:41:51.768 --> 00:42:06.916]  If I'm a homosexual and I hear Ted Pike saying that on the radio, and Alex Jones aids and abets me by putting me on the radio, according to this hate bill which is now before the Senate, both of us would be standing in the docket indicted for a hate crime.
[00:42:08.044 --> 00:42:09.024]  Now let's be clear.
[00:42:09.645 --> 00:42:13.706]  Three years ago in Philadelphia, they arrested people and charged them with 47 years.
[00:42:13.786 --> 00:42:14.947]  It's all on your website.
[00:42:15.347 --> 00:42:19.909]  It's all over the web with the video for kneeling and praying.
[00:42:20.449 --> 00:42:22.050]  And they said that is hateful.
[00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:35.495]  And folks, even if you disagree with Ted Pike's views or you disagree with people's views on homosexuality, the point is you better support free speech because this is aimed at everyone's free speech in this country.
[00:42:36.773 --> 00:42:41.336]  It's on so many fronts that they want to restrict free speech.
[00:42:41.536 --> 00:42:56.204]  They desperately need to do this, and going back to the Fairness Doctrine that they didn't get rid of until 87, there was no real talk radio in this country because you had to give equal time, you couldn't criticize a group, you look at the
[00:42:57.507 --> 00:42:57.908]  I don't
[00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.350]  Yes, it is.
[00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.492]  Now, this legislation, as I said, is ready to go if it is passed into law.
[00:43:36.972 --> 00:43:43.594]  In a very dramatic vote last Thursday, the House of Representatives did overwhelmingly pass this legislation.
[00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:49.875]  Now, I'm getting emails saying that it doesn't exist and that it didn't pass and that everything's okay.
[00:43:50.255 --> 00:43:50.835]  Did you hear?
[00:43:50.855 --> 00:43:52.596]  It has passed the House.
[00:43:52.656 --> 00:43:53.776]  It's now in the Senate.
[00:43:54.236 --> 00:43:54.776]  That's right.
[00:43:54.836 --> 00:44:02.178]  Now, fortunately, the President, as a result of a massive amount of pressure from the New Right and Far Right and so on,
[00:44:02.618 --> 00:44:04.861]  I did intervene last Thursday.
[00:44:04.901 --> 00:44:14.352]  He sent a message to Congress that if they did pass the hate bill in both the House and Senate, his top advisors are advising him to veto it.
[00:44:14.713 --> 00:44:15.494]  But meanwhile...
[00:44:16.242 --> 00:44:18.943]  In the Senate, it's moving forward very rapidly.
[00:44:19.243 --> 00:44:25.444]  In fact, in a very high-handed way, the Senate Judiciary Committee is moving it out.
[00:44:26.105 --> 00:44:32.266]  It's actually in judiciary, but they're planning next Monday or so to move it out with absolutely no hearing.
[00:44:32.346 --> 00:44:35.087]  Where do you think they're going to attach it as a pork barrel item?
[00:44:35.647 --> 00:44:42.529]  Well, it's been stand-alone legislation in the House, and they were planning on doing that in the Senate.
[00:44:42.629 --> 00:44:43.049]  Oh really?
[00:44:43.409 --> 00:44:46.430]  Haven't they in the past mainly attached it as a rider?
[00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:54.713]  They have, but they've been so bold and so confident this year with the Democrats in control that they thought they could do it stand-alone in the Senate as well.
[00:44:55.033 --> 00:45:04.736]  But in a call yesterday I made to Kennedy's office, they told me that they are now considering trying to kind of disguise it as on the underbelly of some
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:18.584]  You know, pork legislation, whatever, but it was announced, in fact, last Tuesday to be up for a possible vote on the floor of the Senate today or tomorrow, this week.
[00:45:18.644 --> 00:45:26.307]  However, I have made some more calls back there, and this big drug prescription legislation is preoccupying the Senate right now.
[00:45:26.707 --> 00:45:35.852]  But it's definitely being pushed back until next week, and this is really a golden opportunity for everybody to take these extra few days... Yeah, all we need is four or five senators.
[00:45:35.892 --> 00:45:37.553]  Who do we target?
[00:45:37.593 --> 00:45:38.433]  Who's on the fence?
[00:45:39.194 --> 00:45:45.897]  Well, actually, there are 14 Republican senators who voted for the hate bill in 2004.
[00:45:47.463 --> 00:45:53.806]  And at our website, truthtellers.org, we have those very conspicuously displayed.
[00:45:54.126 --> 00:45:58.088]  And also there's 17 who have not declared themselves.
[00:45:58.128 --> 00:45:59.649]  We also have that list.
[00:46:00.009 --> 00:46:06.172]  And also we have 10 Democrats who have not co-signed on this legislation.
[00:46:06.192 --> 00:46:10.534]  Now this is very interesting because the House bill passed
[00:46:11.287 --> 00:46:16.350]  With 14 Democrats refusing to vote for the hate bill.
[00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:18.551]  This is absolutely unprecedented.
[00:46:18.571 --> 00:46:23.034]  14 ducked the Democratic majority and went against the hate bill.
[00:46:23.254 --> 00:46:27.717]  This is an indication we might pick up a Democrat or two in the Senate.
[00:46:27.977 --> 00:46:38.483]  And if we could even get only five Republicans to come back to the Republican fold and vote against the hate bill, along with a couple Democrats, we could smash the hate bill in the Senate next week.
[00:46:39.273 --> 00:46:54.639]  Absolutely, and you notice they're more skittish about gun control now because they had so many political defeats in the 90s, and over 80% on average of those that voted for anti-gun bills were removed through the voting process of the people.
[00:46:55.139 --> 00:46:57.880]  And so we need to continue to drive a stake through the heart.
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:03.022]  I know people get fatigued having to battle this every session, but if you don't
[00:47:03.942 --> 00:47:15.070]  Literally, folks, they're going to start arresting talk show hosts and pastors, like they do in Canada and Germany and England, and you're not going to hear true, candid discussions, and the darkness is going to increase.
[00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:17.091]  Reverend Ted Pike, thank you for the update.
[00:47:17.312 --> 00:47:18.312]  We'll talk to you next week.
[00:47:18.673 --> 00:47:19.273]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:47:19.713 --> 00:47:20.074]  You bet.
[00:47:20.094 --> 00:47:20.514]  Thank you.
[00:47:21.595 --> 00:47:25.337]  Alright, getting back to only Ron Paul can defeat Hillary Clinton.
[00:47:26.218 --> 00:47:27.499]  I mean that when I say it.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.841]  I mean what I said, and I said what I meant.
[00:47:31.915 --> 00:47:40.802]  And when we get back, I'm going to get a little bit into 9-11 with Webster Tarpley being viciously attacked as they try to spin things in overdrive on Fox News last night.
[00:47:40.842 --> 00:47:46.547]  Before I end this segment, I want to encourage all of you out there who are listening.
[00:47:48.337 --> 00:47:49.458]  To support Ron Paul.
[00:47:49.498 --> 00:47:52.161]  To fight the thought crime bills.
[00:47:52.762 --> 00:47:54.683]  And to also support this radio show.
[00:47:54.824 --> 00:47:56.265]  Spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:47:56.585 --> 00:47:57.827]  That's how we reach more people.
[00:47:57.867 --> 00:47:58.687]  That's our goal.
[00:47:59.228 --> 00:48:00.870]  And also get the documentary films.
[00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:02.051]  I've made 15 of them.
[00:48:02.631 --> 00:48:06.455]  My police state films are now on DVD in a 3 DVD box set.
[00:48:06.475 --> 00:48:06.896]  45% off.
[00:48:06.936 --> 00:48:07.116]  It's $34.95.
[00:48:11.377 --> 00:48:12.359]  Normally it would be $60.
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:18.410]  That's my three films in a box set for $34.95 and your purchase literally makes this broadcast possible.
[00:48:19.211 --> 00:48:21.655]  Get Aaron Russo.
[00:48:21.776 --> 00:48:24.661]  In fact I keep meaning, I keep forgetting, I've been so busy I haven't called him.
[00:48:25.817 --> 00:48:27.679]  Tell my producer right now, call and see how Aaron's doing.
[00:48:27.699 --> 00:48:29.520]  I know he's really battling cancer right now.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.923]  We all need to pray for him, and we need to get his work out to everybody.
[00:48:34.644 --> 00:48:44.952]  That is Aaron Russo's America, Freedom to Fascism, available at InfoWars.com, the actual high-quality DVD produced by Aaron Russo.
[00:48:45.993 --> 00:48:48.135]  Please get it at InfoWars.com as well.
[00:48:49.998 --> 00:48:58.704]  It's $9.95 a piece, loose-chain second edition from the boys, from the young men that made the film, actually supporting them there.
[00:48:59.325 --> 00:49:03.408]  And there's a lot of bootlegs out there, folks, but we sell the originals.
[00:49:04.088 --> 00:49:10.653]  Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C., Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 2.
[00:49:11.494 --> 00:49:15.377]  Riddles in Stone is such an important film, and it just came out a few months ago.
[00:49:15.397 --> 00:49:16.017]  I hope you get that.
[00:49:16.097 --> 00:49:16.918]  I racked for sale
[00:49:17.498 --> 00:49:18.719]  And so many other great films.
[00:49:18.779 --> 00:49:20.700]  We're adding new materials all the time.
[00:49:21.181 --> 00:49:30.507]  We have David Ray Griffin's new book, Debunking the 9-11 Debunkers.
[00:49:30.527 --> 00:49:35.951]  Give that to your family that's brainwashed by the CIA, Hearst Publishing, lies, and popular mechanics.
[00:49:36.051 --> 00:49:37.512]  Get Debunking the 9-11 Debunkers.
[00:49:37.772 --> 00:49:42.856]  And we have a film about the work and about the information that David Ray Griffin puts forward.
[00:49:42.876 --> 00:49:45.758]  A presentation that's discounted with the book, if you wish.
[00:49:46.258 --> 00:49:47.859]  At Infowars.com.
[00:49:48.259 --> 00:49:55.621]  It's all available at Infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:49:55.741 --> 00:50:06.864]  That number again ladies and gentlemen to call to ask about the specials to order via the telephone 888-253-3139 or you can simply write to me I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100 Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:50:16.457 --> 00:50:20.799]  And I do want to just take some time out here to thank all of you that write me letters, all of you that email us.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.961]  I never can respond, but I do read it, or my staff reads it.
[00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:26.942]  I spend at least an hour every day just trying to read it all.
[00:50:27.763 --> 00:50:30.284]  And just scanning over it, and a lot of it brings tears to my eyes.
[00:50:30.324 --> 00:50:32.225]  And the photos, and all the things you send us.
[00:50:33.166 --> 00:50:39.649]  And for those that support us, that go one step further, that buy the books, that buy the videos, that get prisonplanted.tv memberships.
[00:50:41.067 --> 00:50:50.694]  Thank you, because we couldn't be here and we couldn't be what we're doing every day if it wasn't for you that stand right beside us in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:50:51.254 --> 00:50:58.599]  I pledge my soul, my sacred honor, my name and my treasure to beating these people and I appreciate you supporting us.
[00:50:58.619 --> 00:50:59.200]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:04.554 --> 00:51:07.759]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.139 --> 00:51:10.062]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.443 --> 00:51:18.094]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:25.823]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.223 --> 00:51:37.668]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.948 --> 00:51:41.450]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:43.851]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.171 --> 00:51:47.953]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:51:48.613 --> 00:51:56.067]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:52:01.184 --> 00:52:09.448]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.708 --> 00:52:14.049]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:23.273]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:27.075]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.375 --> 00:52:32.419]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.699 --> 00:52:39.405]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.921 --> 00:52:40.602]  What about you?
[00:52:41.222 --> 00:52:46.586]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:01.149 --> 00:53:02.870]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.091 --> 00:53:06.794]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:07.114 --> 00:53:16.041]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.201 --> 00:53:20.845]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:20.845 --> 00:53:21.325]  We're good to go.
[00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:39.970]  One simple switch.
[00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:43.192]  There's no software to load, and it's so easy to install.
[00:53:43.532 --> 00:53:48.614]  Right now, you can order your Net7 security switch from Net7 Technologies for only $39.95.

[00:53:55.076 --> 00:54:00.138]  That's Net, the number 7, Tech.com, and start protecting yourself today!
[00:54:09.014 --> 00:54:14.465]  I'm gonna have to play the second half of this when David Ray Griffin's on with us in the third hour.
[00:54:14.925 --> 00:54:16.048]  Here's the second half.
[00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:19.911]  This is where Hannity comes in and starts saying, OK, who blew it up then?
[00:54:19.971 --> 00:54:20.672]  Tell me, tell me.
[00:54:21.052 --> 00:54:23.113]  Well, the government's never convicted anybody on 9-11.
[00:54:23.453 --> 00:54:25.934]  The government's never proven how those buildings fell.
[00:54:25.974 --> 00:54:28.475]  The government can't say how the bombs got in there.
[00:54:28.535 --> 00:54:31.196]  We just know that Al-Qaeda is CIA controlled.
[00:54:31.437 --> 00:54:32.897]  We know this whole thing was supported.
[00:54:33.137 --> 00:54:39.320]  We know there's controlled demolitions from the witnesses in Building 7, and the police, and Larry Silverstein, and all of it.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:43.682]  Let's see, they try this tactic of, oh, then who put the bombs in there?
[00:54:45.442 --> 00:54:53.294]  It's absolutely pathetic as Tarpley is being, what they did was pathetic as they tag team Webster Tarpley on Fox News.
[00:54:53.314 --> 00:54:58.522]  You know this folks, they never have me on Fox News because I will clean their clocks.
[00:54:58.563 --> 00:54:59.925]  Tarpley did a pretty good job though, here it is.
[00:55:00.569 --> 00:55:02.070]  ...thing collapsed in the middle first.
[00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:06.172]  It's classic controlled demolition, just in the same way that the Twin Towers were.
[00:55:06.212 --> 00:55:08.133]  What would be the motivation, Mr. Tarpley?
[00:55:08.233 --> 00:55:09.593]  Why would the government do it?
[00:55:09.673 --> 00:55:11.114]  What would be behind their thinking?
[00:55:11.154 --> 00:55:13.015]  Give me a reason, give me a motivation here.
[00:55:13.035 --> 00:55:14.896]  It amounts to a rogue network.
[00:55:14.956 --> 00:55:19.538]  It's the people who brought you the Kennedy assassination, the Gulf of Tonkin, the bombing of Serbia.
[00:55:19.978 --> 00:55:23.660]  Their goal is the war of civilizations, and that's what you see.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.480]  Using this as a premise,
[00:55:26.421 --> 00:55:29.184]  They have attacked Afghanistan, attacked Iran.
[00:55:29.224 --> 00:55:31.887]  They're preparing to attack Iran.
[00:55:31.907 --> 00:55:33.268]  They've attacked Iran.
[00:55:33.288 --> 00:55:34.750]  Let's go to the videotape.
[00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:45.020]  So you're saying that after the planes hit the Trade Center, that the government, in a controlled fashion, went in and then bombed the... No, that's exactly what I'm not arguing.
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:45.420]  What are you doing?
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:45.821]  What are you doing?
[00:55:45.841 --> 00:55:48.863]  This is a controlled demolition, and this is the shallowness of Kerry.
[00:55:49.263 --> 00:55:54.867]  If you want to have a controlled demolition, it takes at least several days of very careful... And you think that happened?
[00:55:54.927 --> 00:55:56.148]  And do you believe that happened, sir?
[00:55:56.188 --> 00:55:58.650]  Yes, that's obviously what happened.
[00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:02.673]  Dan, let's show the video so we can remind everybody exactly what we're talking about.
[00:56:02.713 --> 00:56:03.313]  That's building 7.
[00:56:03.353 --> 00:56:04.314]  They don't talk about this.
[00:56:04.554 --> 00:56:11.800]  So you're saying because it looks like a controlled demolition, do you have any evidence who loaded up that building with some...
[00:56:14.221 --> 00:56:14.661]  Explosives.
[00:56:14.701 --> 00:56:21.523]  This is exactly what the Kane-Hamilton Commission did not do.
[00:56:21.603 --> 00:56:23.263]  Who loaded up the building with explosives?
[00:56:23.283 --> 00:56:27.344]  Someone who has very capable, controlled demolition expertise.
[00:56:27.844 --> 00:56:33.645]  Not Bin Laden, not Al-Qaeda, not some group of psychotic patsies in a cave of iron.
[00:56:33.685 --> 00:56:35.505]  But somebody who actually can do these things.
[00:56:35.585 --> 00:56:38.486]  The physical, technical ability to create, to absorb
[00:56:38.686 --> 00:56:43.009]  You throw out all these allegations, but you have no proof, and you have a conspiracy theory.
[00:56:43.029 --> 00:56:43.730]  Here's my question.
[00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:46.091]  I commend my book to people's attention.
[00:56:46.251 --> 00:56:46.612]  500 pages.
[00:56:46.712 --> 00:56:49.534]  We saw the pictures of the planes hitting the building.
[00:56:49.954 --> 00:56:52.075]  Bin Laden himself was taking... But not this building!
[00:56:52.176 --> 00:56:52.396]  Excuse me.
[00:56:52.416 --> 00:56:57.099]  The question we were asked in Austin was about World Trade Center 7.
[00:56:57.139 --> 00:56:57.779]  No plane!
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:01.142]  Webster, if you take a deep breath, I'm going to help educate you here.
[00:57:01.762 --> 00:57:06.023]  If you watch the buildings get hit by the planes and Bin Laden takes credit for it.
[00:57:06.043 --> 00:57:07.424]  Now, there was an investigation.
[00:57:07.444 --> 00:57:08.364]  Which Bin Laden?
[00:57:08.404 --> 00:57:09.144]  That Bin Laden?
[00:57:09.164 --> 00:57:10.345]  That would be Osama Bin Laden.
[00:57:10.805 --> 00:57:14.046]  The Bin Laden who says he did it, there's a Bin Laden who says he didn't do it.
[00:57:14.066 --> 00:57:14.546]  We're going to play more.
[00:57:14.566 --> 00:57:16.527]  I mean, he did a great job of them talking over him.
[00:57:17.887 --> 00:57:19.648]  All I would have brought forward is Northwoods.
[00:57:19.828 --> 00:57:20.328]  The U.S.
[00:57:20.368 --> 00:57:22.329]  government has staged terror attacks before.
[00:57:22.869 --> 00:57:24.229]  It's now declassified.
[00:57:24.629 --> 00:57:25.930]  But he basically tried to do that.
[00:57:27.472 --> 00:57:31.153]  Now, a lot of times they just cut your mic off, too, and you could see they were starting to fade it down.
[00:57:31.173 --> 00:57:32.353]  We're going to play more of it later.
[00:57:33.073 --> 00:57:34.734]  It's just so frustrating to watch this.
[00:57:34.754 --> 00:57:37.475]  They have both of them double-teaming him.
[00:57:37.735 --> 00:57:39.735]  By the way, we have 9-11 Synthetic Terror.
[00:57:40.095 --> 00:57:41.856]  We carry it at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:41.876 --> 00:57:42.776]  It's one of the books we carry.
[00:57:43.216 --> 00:57:51.118]  And I think it is one of the best books just on how these rogue networks work, how they operate, how these overall programs are carried out.
[00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:58.333]  9-11 Synthetic Terror is excellent and it's available at InfoWars.com and it deserves to be seen.
[00:57:58.353 --> 00:58:03.996]  We're going to be posting some new Tarp Lease pictures as well up on PrisonPlanet.tv very, very soon.
[00:58:04.016 --> 00:58:11.680]  I mean, the bottom line motive is just like Hitler and the Reichstag.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.361]  You stage a terror attack to get this done.
[00:58:14.346 --> 00:58:21.992]  And when they start talking about planes hitting the buildings, you just bring up the fact that, oh, you mean the people standing in the wounds of the buildings that weren't on fire but the columns all shattered?
[00:58:22.433 --> 00:58:24.775]  The firemen and police reported that bombs were going off?
[00:58:25.155 --> 00:58:27.337]  The owner says that they gave the order to pull the building?
[00:58:28.538 --> 00:58:29.299]  Bam, bam, bam!
[00:58:30.419 --> 00:58:31.160]  It's irrefutable.
[00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:36.985]  Alright, we're gonna come back and we're gonna get into the JFK assassination and all the big developments there.
[00:58:41.317 --> 00:58:46.204]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.998 --> 00:59:02.183]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.824 --> 00:59:03.645]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.406 --> 00:59:05.307]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.967 --> 00:59:09.712]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.152 --> 00:59:14.217]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.021 --> 00:59:30.073]  We're going to be having Jim Mars with us coming up in the next segment for the rest of the hour to discuss all the huge JFK assassination developments with E. Howard Hunt tape being released and so much more.
[00:59:31.223 --> 00:59:33.445]  We're going to get his expert analysis.
[00:59:33.505 --> 00:59:35.027]  He's even taught college courses.
[00:59:36.408 --> 00:59:37.229]  Taught the first course.
[00:59:37.289 --> 00:59:39.611]  Now they're quite popular on JFK Assassination.
[00:59:40.232 --> 00:59:50.682]  And he was a newsman there in Fort Worth and reported on it, of course, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
[00:59:51.853 --> 00:59:53.073]  So, that is coming up.
[00:59:53.473 --> 00:59:56.974]  By the way, Ron Paul will be participating in May and June debates.
[00:59:56.994 --> 01:00:03.376]  This is an InfoWars.net article written by Russell Gentile, who we appreciate writing for us.
[01:00:03.396 --> 01:00:10.737]  He says he spoke with Ron Paul's campaign office today, inquiring as the Fox debate on May 15th, and the official word is Ron Paul will be participating.
[01:00:11.097 --> 01:00:16.518]  Now, folks, this has been going on since Monday, and their office can barely conduct business.
[01:00:16.958 --> 01:00:19.479]  We told you on Monday.
[01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:22.592]  That he is participating.
[01:00:22.692 --> 01:00:23.913]  It is a rumor.
[01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:40.147]  If you want to help Ron Paul's office, you need to tell everybody this is a rumor and get everybody focused on stopping Yahoo and stopping Fox, which controls MySpace, in censoring his bulletins, blocking his face off the main page.
[01:00:40.547 --> 01:00:46.212]  Yahoo now says that they have not posted him on their site talking about the debate because he isn't a candidate.
[01:00:46.292 --> 01:00:46.993]  Total lie!
[01:00:48.073 --> 01:00:50.074]  Uh, that's the serious issues.
[01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:56.538]  And I'm getting emails saying, how dare I not, you know, stand up and get him in the debates.
[01:00:56.858 --> 01:00:57.979]  Okay, fine.
[01:00:58.059 --> 01:01:00.700]  Okay, I just can't, I can't make everybody happy.
[01:01:01.621 --> 01:01:04.723]  And there's, there's a lot of just, and I'm glad to see this type of frothing energy.
[01:01:04.743 --> 01:01:05.283]  That's good.
[01:01:05.723 --> 01:01:07.744]  But let's direct it into something that matters.
[01:01:09.626 --> 01:01:13.228]  Uh, he will be in the June 5th debate in New Hampshire, televised on CNN.
[01:01:14.489 --> 01:01:22.614]  Also, since the last debate, Ron Paul's office has seen a 4X increase in donations, and web traffic and interest has increased dramatically.
[01:01:23.015 --> 01:01:28.178]  The campaign, in their words, is going well, even though you wouldn't know it by the major media.
[01:01:28.498 --> 01:01:30.680]  Ron Paul needs us to spread the word for him.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:35.843]  However we see fit, please talk to your friends, neighbors, spread the word, and if you can, make donations.
[01:01:38.285 --> 01:01:38.845]  Absolutely.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.762]  And again, the internet is the key place to get this word out.
[01:01:42.802 --> 01:01:45.684]  Go get the article that we wrote up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:46.104 --> 01:01:48.386]  Only Ron Paul can defeat Hillary Clinton.
[01:01:48.686 --> 01:01:51.388]  The dig censors are in there trying to dig this down.
[01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:54.570]  Let's just run over the top of them and dig it up to the main page.
[01:01:54.851 --> 01:01:56.732]  This site is hundreds of times bigger.
[01:01:57.438 --> 01:01:57.938]  In ranking.
[01:01:58.359 --> 01:02:01.780]  It's like 40-something now, and Drudge is 500-something.
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.821]  To give you an idea of how big Dig is, okay?
[01:02:04.181 --> 01:02:05.522]  One of the biggest secrets on the web.
[01:02:05.782 --> 01:02:07.563]  People don't seem to know how important this is.
[01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:10.104]  Rampage it right over the top of them.
[01:02:10.524 --> 01:02:11.785]  Lately we've been having victories.
[01:02:11.805 --> 01:02:19.289]  You've been pushing Dig stories that we put over the top, on the main page, and we're getting millions of readers from it.
[01:02:19.749 --> 01:02:21.590]  So let's just run over them!
[01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:23.811]  Take the hill, run over them!
[01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:27.710]  They've been caught censoring, and that's blown up in their face.
[01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:30.610]  It's now been proven that Digg is rigged.
[01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:31.530]  But you know what?
[01:02:32.131 --> 01:02:36.071]  Even when they rig something, folks, if you just gut up, you can usually run over the top of them.
[01:02:37.072 --> 01:02:40.112]  And then you make them steal it in front of everybody.
[01:02:40.773 --> 01:02:41.953]  Just because they steal elections.
[01:02:42.453 --> 01:02:45.474]  You let all the polls show Ron Paul's gonna win.
[01:02:45.694 --> 01:02:47.054]  You let them steal it in front of everybody.
[01:02:47.634 --> 01:02:51.495]  You see, you make them show everybody who and what they are.
[01:02:53.772 --> 01:02:57.393]  Alright, I'm done ranting about that, but it is extremely important.
[01:02:58.834 --> 01:03:00.994]  I told you how Fox News is now behind Hillary.
[01:03:01.034 --> 01:03:02.295]  We have all the proof of that posted.
[01:03:02.695 --> 01:03:04.495]  They're really running her campaign and advising her.
[01:03:04.515 --> 01:03:06.876]  I've seen them softening for her on television.
[01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:10.097]  Now it comes out Murdoch sets emissions goal.
[01:03:10.998 --> 01:03:12.398]  This out of the News of Australia.
[01:03:12.418 --> 01:03:21.521]  The Herald Sun, the world's top media company, news corporation, will slash its global carbon footprint to zero under a bold plan revealed by its chairman, Rupert Murdoch.
[01:03:23.536 --> 01:03:31.999]  Saying the Global Empire produced 641,150 tons of greenhouse gas last year, the news chairman and CEO last night pledged to go green.
[01:03:32.939 --> 01:03:38.601]  He says he believes in global warming, and of course he wants the global tax that the big bankers that finance him are pushing.
[01:03:39.981 --> 01:03:47.283]  If there was ever a doubt that man-made global warming is a fraud, and their solution of global tax is a fraud, there it is, you dumb mainline liberals!
[01:03:47.763 --> 01:03:50.224]  You're now in bed with Rupert Murdoch and Hillary Clinton.
[01:03:54.088 --> 01:04:02.434]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.

[01:04:42.501 --> 01:05:02.126]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:02.506 --> 01:05:10.108]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.822 --> 01:05:17.885]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:18.285 --> 01:05:29.710]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:33.712]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:35.913]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:36.233 --> 01:05:40.095]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:55.382 --> 01:05:57.343]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[01:05:57.823 --> 01:06:00.464]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[01:06:01.264 --> 01:06:02.384]  For a while, anyway.
[01:06:02.885 --> 01:06:06.066]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[01:06:06.686 --> 01:06:09.007]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:06:09.327 --> 01:06:12.808]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:06:13.168 --> 01:06:15.449]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:06:15.989 --> 01:06:16.689]  What's the name again?
[01:06:16.709 --> 01:06:18.070]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:19.270]  It's CalX.
[01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:19.790]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:06:22.142 --> 01:06:23.823]  What makes Cal-X ointment so different?
[01:06:24.043 --> 01:06:32.347]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:06:33.388 --> 01:06:37.950]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:47.275]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:06:47.975 --> 01:06:49.096]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[01:06:49.136 --> 01:06:49.796]  I'll be right back.
[01:06:50.056 --> 01:06:50.997]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:56.482]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.502 --> 01:06:59.903]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.544 --> 01:07:07.726]  Well, Jim Mars has taught college courses on the JFK assassination.
[01:07:07.746 --> 01:07:12.467]  He started out working for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram as a crime reporter.
[01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:22.511]  Driving around covering the police, and what a great position to cover the JFK assassination, right there in the DFW area, Dallas-Fort Worth area.
[01:07:24.369 --> 01:07:28.953]  For the next 51 minutes that we've got left in this hour, he is our guest today.
[01:07:29.033 --> 01:07:35.798]  By the way, we carry his book on the 9-11 operations at Infowars.com.
[01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:38.520]  We'll be telling you about that a little bit later.
[01:07:39.401 --> 01:07:43.865]  Jim Mars, of course we have links to his website too up on Infowars.com.
[01:07:44.705 --> 01:07:46.787]  Jim, it is great to have you with us, my friend.
[01:07:47.207 --> 01:07:49.789]  Well, it's always good to be with you, Alex.
[01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:51.771]  You're out there leading the charge.
[01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:55.631]  Jim, so much has happened.
[01:07:55.991 --> 01:07:58.893]  Just for those that don't know who you are, you might have been hiding under a rock somewhere.
[01:07:59.173 --> 01:08:03.255]  In a nutshell, tell us about Jim Mars and then let's get into what really happened.
[01:08:03.275 --> 01:08:08.278]  This new E. Howard Hunt stuff coming out just confirms on top of the mountains
[01:08:08.938 --> 01:08:12.880]  I mean, who Jim Mars is and what this E. Howard Hunt material means?
[01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:36.852]  Well, okay, first off, who I am.
[01:08:37.192 --> 01:08:39.674]  Basically, I'm just an old print news reporter.
[01:08:41.916 --> 01:08:43.277]  I have a degree in journalism.
[01:08:43.377 --> 01:08:46.739]  I dedicated myself to journalism many, many, many years ago.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.161]  I'm also the last of a dying breed.
[01:08:49.221 --> 01:08:50.082]  I'm a generalist.
[01:08:50.582 --> 01:08:52.824]  I know a little bit about a lot of things, okay?
[01:08:53.445 --> 01:08:59.870]  And that's getting to be kind of hard to find in this day of specialization and compartmentalization.
[01:09:02.031 --> 01:09:05.153]  Basically what happened to me was I didn't leave journalism.
[01:09:05.333 --> 01:09:06.614]  Journalism left me.
[01:09:07.675 --> 01:09:14.279]  Today, particularly in the electronic media, you don't have people who are trained and educated in journalism.
[01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:20.963]  You just have air personalities and they're at the whims of the programming directors
[01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:23.951]  Uh, who are looking for numbers.
[01:09:24.491 --> 01:09:34.734]  And so you get fluff stories and puss stories and government propaganda and no, but there doesn't seem to be any, uh, real hardcore investigative journalism.
[01:09:35.194 --> 01:09:37.595]  This is why things like 9-11 could happen.
[01:09:38.235 --> 01:09:45.257]  And, uh, it's taken us 40 years to finally come around and realize that the official conspiracy theory is just full of holes.
[01:09:46.018 --> 01:09:49.979]  Now, as far as the Kennedy assassination goes, it's really pretty simple.
[01:09:51.061 --> 01:09:56.902]  The one thing everyone can agree on about the Kennedy assassination is that it's controversial.
[01:09:57.522 --> 01:09:59.323]  But I'm here to tell you, it's not.
[01:10:00.143 --> 01:10:00.503]  Okay?
[01:10:00.843 --> 01:10:15.246]  It only appears controversial because of the wide gulf between those who have just blindly accepted the government's official pronouncements, backed by little or nothing, as opposed to those who have actually studied the case.
[01:10:17.137 --> 01:10:29.929]  And if you study the case, what you find is that if Oswald acted alone, and that's a very big if, he didn't act alone.
[01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:32.551]  I mean, he did not act alone.
[01:10:32.672 --> 01:10:40.479]  There are gunmen on the knoll, there was all kinds of people with Secret Service identification running around in Daly Plaza when none were supposed to be there.
[01:10:41.107 --> 01:10:51.215]  There was an army intelligence agent who got trapped in the school book depository, had to show his ID to get out, and was taking photographs of the Texas school book depository prior to the shooting.
[01:10:52.076 --> 01:10:53.317]  I mean, I could go on and on.
[01:10:53.817 --> 01:10:56.199]  So obviously, he did not act alone.
[01:10:56.819 --> 01:11:01.043]  And if he did not act alone, then by dictionary definition, there was a conspiracy.
[01:11:01.563 --> 01:11:10.708]  And if there was a conspiracy, then it's obvious that that's been covered up officially to this very day, which means that could only have taken place.
[01:11:11.148 --> 01:11:13.049]  Khrushchev could not have covered it up.
[01:11:13.389 --> 01:11:15.230]  Castro could not have covered it up.
[01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:17.731]  A few mobsters could not have covered it up.
[01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:21.433]  It was covered up at the highest levels of federal government in the United States.
[01:11:21.813 --> 01:11:32.383]  The Kennedy assassination was a coup d'etat, and that was when the government of the United States changed due to a violent act, which is the definition of a coup d'etat.
[01:11:32.524 --> 01:11:34.165]  And it's the same thing on 9-11.
[01:11:34.185 --> 01:11:41.272]  9-11, they've been covering it up, and they have the motive, and then surprise, surprise, surprise, they're involved and ended up with their eyeballs.
[01:11:41.652 --> 01:11:42.193]  Exactly.
[01:11:42.253 --> 01:11:43.274]  Now, 43 years later,
[01:11:44.535 --> 01:11:56.183]  Almost the polls show that virtually everyone in the country realizes that Kennedy was killed as a result of a conspiracy, but it's like so much time's gone by, it's kind of like, oh well, so what?
[01:11:56.623 --> 01:12:10.152]  Alright, now, when you talk about 9-11, the evidence and the facts would show that 9-11 was an inside job, that at very best, high officials knew it was going to happen and allowed it to happen.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:18.364]  Now, the evidence for that is so plain, so in your face, that it makes the Kennedy assassination look like a deep, dark mystery.
[01:12:20.425 --> 01:12:27.189]  Well, I agree with you, but let's go back here, because I want to get into 9-11 some today, but let's get into JFK first.
[01:12:27.689 --> 01:12:32.612]  I know someone as immersed as yourself, probably the preeminent living expert, Jim,
[01:12:34.125 --> 01:12:36.487]  That it's a no-brainer and you're kind of like, hey, it's old news.
[01:12:37.068 --> 01:12:54.363]  But it isn't old news in that if Bruce Willis finally says there was a coup d'etat, the government's been overthrown since 1963, the people that killed Kennedy are in power right now, he's clearly saying the Bushes, and we know George Herbert Walker was involved, the evidence is overwhelming there.
[01:12:54.383 --> 01:12:58.006]  I mean, if even their poster boy, who bought all their propaganda,
[01:12:59.202 --> 01:12:59.342]  Yes.
[01:13:24.045 --> 01:13:24.646]  We're good to go.
[01:13:36.677 --> 01:13:40.380]  How big is it to have E. Howard Hunt release this tape?
[01:13:40.641 --> 01:13:42.782]  A. B. Why do you think he released it?
[01:13:43.363 --> 01:13:50.909]  And clearly C. He's holding back on, you know, obviously a few things, calling it the big event and claiming that Kordmeier was in command.
[01:13:51.129 --> 01:13:55.173]  From your research, exactly how involved was E. Howard Hunt?
[01:13:55.997 --> 01:14:00.739]  Well, let me just start with the note to Oswald.
[01:14:01.639 --> 01:14:08.222]  Back in the 70s, someone sent researcher Penn Jones a letter from Mexico City.
[01:14:08.302 --> 01:14:12.383]  It was all in Spanish, and basically just said, I think you need to know about this.
[01:14:12.423 --> 01:14:16.265]  And enclosed was a copy of a letter that said, Dear Mr. Hunt,
[01:14:17.268 --> 01:14:24.914]  Uh, before anything is done by me or anybody else, I think I should, I would want to, uh, establish exactly what my position is.
[01:14:25.315 --> 01:14:26.276]  And it's something like that.
[01:14:26.376 --> 01:14:28.077]  And it's signed Lee Harvey Oswald.
[01:14:28.818 --> 01:14:34.722]  Now, since, uh, then when Penn Jones made that public, it was coming out of Texas and out of Dallas.
[01:14:35.303 --> 01:14:38.526]  And a lot of people thought that that might refer to H.L.
[01:14:38.586 --> 01:14:40.187]  Hunt, the old Texas oil man.
[01:14:40.802 --> 01:14:53.492]  But since it came out of Mexico City, me and other researchers feel like that that note was probably to E. Howard Hunt, who had been acting station chief in Mexico City about that time.
[01:14:54.132 --> 01:14:59.797]  So that place is Hunt, right in the center of the plot to kill Kennedy.
[01:15:00.425 --> 01:15:07.532]  Now, in his deathbed so-called confessions, I think that he, number one, was trying to clear his conscience.
[01:15:08.053 --> 01:15:11.276]  Number two, he was trying to kind of set the record straight.
[01:15:11.356 --> 01:15:18.023]  Keep in mind that he had maintained for years he had nothing to do with it and was home with his family the weekend of the assassination.
[01:15:18.403 --> 01:15:29.152]  I already knew that was false because I at one point met a woman who had been friends with his daughter and his daughter said privately, no he wasn't there, we all wondered where he was.
[01:15:29.212 --> 01:15:29.713]  Well St.
[01:15:29.773 --> 01:15:34.637]  John says he remembers being in school and being scared when his dad was out of town.
[01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:35.638]  Exactly.
[01:15:36.218 --> 01:15:37.259]  So he lied about that.
[01:15:40.234 --> 01:15:49.439]  Major CIA officer, so he's trained, conditioned, and lived a life of lies, so we can't just put 100% truth on that.
[01:15:49.539 --> 01:16:04.888]  I think the importance of his deathbed confession is that he did, without any equivocation, blatantly state that the assassination of President Kennedy was a domestic plot, which it was.
[01:16:05.718 --> 01:16:08.279]  I think he's trying to downplay his role in the whole thing.
[01:16:23.863 --> 01:16:32.752]  Well, that's because if it comes out, even his son, that had to keep it quiet for three years, could then be implicated, you know, an accessory after the fact for conspiracy covering up.
[01:16:33.072 --> 01:16:33.993]  Right, exactly.
[01:16:34.453 --> 01:16:41.120]  And none of us should ever forget that there is no statute of limitations on murder.
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:48.562]  Okay, and if someone can be proven to have been involved in the assassination of President Kennedy, forget your federal panels.
[01:16:49.002 --> 01:16:53.524]  They should be brought before a grand jury, and there should be murder indictments issued.
[01:16:53.584 --> 01:16:58.925]  In fact, in 1963, there were no federal statutes about killing the President.
[01:16:58.965 --> 01:17:02.106]  The assassination of President John F. Kennedy occurred in Dallas, Texas.
[01:17:02.446 --> 01:17:04.207]  Therefore, it was a Texas homicide.
[01:17:04.707 --> 01:17:06.248]  In fact, this is something interesting.
[01:17:08.718 --> 01:17:14.305]  The coroner in Dallas tried to prevent the removal of Kennedy's body from Parkland Hospital.
[01:17:14.325 --> 01:17:15.627]  He said, this is a local crime.
[01:17:15.647 --> 01:17:16.588]  I have to make a ruling.
[01:17:16.608 --> 01:17:18.030]  I have to do some investigation.
[01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:22.555]  And they actually pulled guns on him and threatened him and said, this is the President of the United States.
[01:17:22.575 --> 01:17:23.176]  Get out of the way.
[01:17:23.216 --> 01:17:25.579]  And they just physically pressed past him.
[01:17:26.289 --> 01:17:26.769]  I don't
[01:17:41.727 --> 01:17:43.709]  Point you in the direction of the guilty parties.
[01:17:43.729 --> 01:17:44.190]  That I do not know.
[01:17:44.210 --> 01:17:47.533]  I've also heard reports that George Herbert Walker Bush was there and that I cannot prove either.
[01:18:00.027 --> 01:18:19.367]  But what seems to be fairly substantiated, and again this goes back to work that was done by Penn Jones and others, plus my discussions with Madeleine Brown, is that present at that meeting on Thursday night was J. Edgar Hoover, Richard Nixon, the Texas oil men, and Lyndon Johnson showed up late.
[01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:32.524]  And she said that Johnson went into the other room, they left the women alone, as was the custom, they went in there and conferred, and then when they came out, Johnson whispered to her fiercely, he said, those G.D.
[01:18:32.624 --> 01:18:35.246]  Kennedys will never bother me again after tomorrow.
[01:18:36.101 --> 01:18:38.703]  And this was on Thursday night prior to the assassination.
[01:18:38.723 --> 01:18:43.686]  I also have information, though, that George Herbert Walker Bush was in Dallas at that time.
[01:18:44.246 --> 01:18:46.268]  But you have to... Hold on, we got a break.
[01:18:46.328 --> 01:18:47.608]  We know he was CIA.
[01:18:47.869 --> 01:18:49.209]  We know he was involved in Bay of Pigs.
[01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:51.911]  We know there's a photograph that is a spitting image of him.
[01:18:51.931 --> 01:18:52.572]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:55.894 --> 01:18:58.435]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:19:00.726 --> 01:19:05.549]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:19:05.769 --> 01:19:08.491]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:19:08.551 --> 01:19:09.651]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:19:10.992 --> 01:19:15.595]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:19:16.515 --> 01:19:23.780]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[01:22:57.489 --> 01:23:01.472]  Jim Mars is our guest author, reporter, journalist.
[01:23:04.251 --> 01:23:06.793]  Jim, I tell you, people can hear the off-air conversations.
[01:23:07.113 --> 01:23:08.174]  That's the real radio.
[01:23:08.854 --> 01:23:15.998]  Let's try to repeat and recap what you were talking about running through evidence of George Herbert Walker, Nixon, there at the meeting.
[01:23:16.018 --> 01:23:16.919]  That's confirmed.
[01:23:17.619 --> 01:23:24.984]  And what this means now to the general public to have E. Howard Hunt, who was clearly photographed there with Frank Sturgis and others, as the
[01:23:26.283 --> 01:23:31.345]  Well, wouldn't it have been something that when Lyndon Johnson landed in Air Force One at Washington
[01:23:49.744 --> 01:23:53.646]  That there had been a phalanx of federal marshals there to place him under arrest.
[01:23:54.007 --> 01:24:07.435]  Of course, that would have been a huge shock and a huge upset for the country, and that's what caused a lot of people who really played no part in it to cave in and go along because, you know, the one rule of the game is don't give away the game.
[01:24:08.155 --> 01:24:12.738]  But here's an important point that everybody has to understand about the Kennedy assassination.
[01:24:13.739 --> 01:24:36.845]  uh... in nineteen sixty two there were no republicans in texas texas was part of what was called the solid south and ever since the war between the states uh... they've been the south had nothing but democrats okay and it was only nineteen sixty two and here's what happened there's an interesting story uh... in nineteen sixty when johnson
[01:24:37.501 --> 01:24:43.763]  Got on the Democratic ticket and was running as a somewhat liberal Democrat along with John Kennedy.
[01:24:44.783 --> 01:25:02.629]  He came to Texas and ran through the Texas legislature some legislation that is now known as the Johnson Law, which allowed him to run as a somewhat liberal Democrat on the national ticket and still run for his Senate seat as a conservative Democrat from Texas.
[01:25:03.129 --> 01:25:06.370]  But as we all know, by a very, very thin margin,
[01:25:06.949 --> 01:25:07.692]  I don't know.
[01:25:14.525 --> 01:25:15.906]  People filed for that seat.
[01:25:15.986 --> 01:25:17.567]  Seventy-one of them were Democrats.
[01:25:18.067 --> 01:25:21.409]  One of them was a school teacher from Waco named John Tower.
[01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:27.253]  And because it so split up the ticket, John Tower, as a Republican, actually won.
[01:25:27.273 --> 01:25:30.515]  And that was quite a shock to the people in Texas.
[01:25:31.035 --> 01:25:34.377]  So, Texas had only had Republican representatives.
[01:25:34.457 --> 01:25:36.678]  And of course, they later blew up Tower's airplane.
[01:25:37.079 --> 01:25:37.579]  That's true.
[01:25:37.659 --> 01:25:42.322]  Tower, who had paid his dues and was all set to become Secretary of Defense,
[01:25:42.802 --> 01:25:43.283]  We're good to go.
[01:26:02.196 --> 01:26:15.020]  But you have to understand, that's why Bush does not figure prominently in the public scenes at that time, because he was a Republican in Texas that was still dominated by the Democrats.
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:21.582]  But we do have Nixon there at the final go-ahead meeting at the Oilman's house in Dallas.
[01:26:23.542 --> 01:26:26.823]  The fact that we do know Bush was in the CIA, that's clear.
[01:26:26.843 --> 01:26:32.265]  They didn't just make him director a few years later out of nowhere, and then go through the stories you got about him in the hotel with Nixon.
[01:26:32.805 --> 01:26:34.846]  Okay, but first let me explain.
[01:26:34.886 --> 01:26:39.748]  It was his father, Prescott Bush, a very powerful Republican Senator from Connecticut.
[01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:41.789]  See, the Bushes are not true Texans.
[01:26:41.989 --> 01:26:43.689]  They're just Yankee carpetbaggers.
[01:26:44.290 --> 01:26:48.111]  And they came down here, they've looted the state, now they're looting the National Treasury.
[01:26:48.927 --> 01:27:00.915]  Um, his father, though, helped create the CIA, so the family, and we all know the CIA has been a good old boy network, and so he's been close, he was closely connected to the CIA all along.
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:16.790]  I am still in touch with a Black Ops military pilot who flew arms and ammunition for the Bay of Pigs invasion, and he said that they were using the pot of drilling of Midland Odessa as a front, as a cover, for flying arms and ammunition for the anti-Castro Cuba.
[01:27:16.810 --> 01:27:21.493]  Well, we have letters with CIA Ops mentioning George W. Bush.
[01:27:21.933 --> 01:27:22.593]  Exactly.
[01:27:22.994 --> 01:27:33.878]  So, and of course that explains why in 75 our unelected President Gerald Ford suddenly just reaches down, pulls out this Texas oil man, George Herbert Walker Bush, and makes him head of the CIA.
[01:27:33.938 --> 01:27:39.221]  It made no sense at the time unless you knew this deep family background connection to the CIA.
[01:27:40.001 --> 01:27:56.828]  We also have an FBI document the very next day, November the 23rd, 1963, that was reporting on the reaction of the anti-Castro-Cuban community to the assassination, and it says this information was provided verbally by Mr. George Bush, the CIA.
[01:27:57.808 --> 01:27:58.088]  I don't know.
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:23.182]  And then a spitting image of him taken in the same group of photos of E. Howard Hunt now, basically admitted to be E. Howard Hunt.
[01:28:23.622 --> 01:28:27.764]  When we get back, let's talk about why the media has been completely silent on these new huge E. Howard Hunt revelations.
[01:28:44.091 --> 01:28:47.080]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:50.691]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.634 --> 01:29:05.644]  JLS Research, the makers of all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[01:29:05.844 --> 01:29:12.349]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:20.176]  By using organics and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[01:29:20.416 --> 01:29:21.117]  As it responds,
[01:29:21.377 --> 01:29:23.399]  Body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[01:29:23.679 --> 01:29:25.520]  First Responder is the first of its kind.
[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:27.182]  Comprised of only four organics.
[01:29:27.502 --> 01:29:30.764]  Grape seed, skim, grape seed, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[01:29:31.145 --> 01:29:35.628]  It's so effective you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.

[01:30:21.319 --> 01:30:30.363]  Many people believe that this will be the Mark of the Beast because of the restrictive measures included, which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[01:30:30.663 --> 01:30:36.946]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the Mark of the Beast, it says, If any man worship the Beast, take notice.
[01:30:37.286 --> 01:30:38.907]  It says, Worship the Beast.
[01:30:39.187 --> 01:30:41.788]  This issue is about worship, not economics.

[01:30:53.385 --> 01:30:55.806]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:30:56.346 --> 01:31:05.969]  Did you know that in 1975, 32 senators and 92 representatives signed a Declaration of Interdependence, which stated that we must bring about a new world order?
[01:31:06.009 --> 01:31:10.691]  It called for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.
[01:31:11.211 --> 01:31:16.093]  It called for the redistribution of the wealth from America to third and fourth world countries.
[01:31:16.913 --> 01:31:27.163]  This is the same New World Order call for by former President George Herbert Walter Bush 210 times at the start of the Iraqi War 1990-1991.

[01:31:58.282 --> 01:32:06.067]  I think it's really important that we all pause and think about the fact that
[01:32:22.541 --> 01:32:30.704]  Over 90% of the American people in every major poll now believe that the government was involved in killing Kennedy, that there was more than one shooter.
[01:32:32.045 --> 01:32:38.747]  And those are numbers from like a year ago, six, eight months ago at the last anniversary.
[01:32:41.168 --> 01:32:42.929]  It's just going to get bigger and bigger.
[01:32:43.469 --> 01:32:45.110]  And when you have Bruce Willis, but see,
[01:32:46.588 --> 01:32:48.250]  I'm not even bad-mouthing Bruce Willis.
[01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:56.361]  His dad was in the army, his mother was German, he grew up on a military base until he was five years old over in Germany.
[01:32:56.561 --> 01:33:02.229]  He loves America, he thinks patriotism, he's just doing whatever the government says and being conservative.
[01:33:03.718 --> 01:33:16.066]  So for somebody like him to go, yeah, the criminal elements killed him, there was a coup d'etat, they usurped and took over the government, and they're still in power today, they may kill me, but I don't care.
[01:33:17.988 --> 01:33:28.515]  And by the way, we told you behind the scenes that he saw my films, he woke up, Rick Linklater just brought that up out of nowhere, and the reason I bring that up is it shows how a film can change things.
[01:33:28.615 --> 01:33:31.477]  It shows how an action can change things.
[01:33:32.526 --> 01:33:42.649]  And he really is a poster child or an archetypal example, a canary in the coal mine for the New World Order because Bruce Willis just shouldn't go
[01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:45.291]  Okay, maybe you're right about a little bit.
[01:33:45.531 --> 01:33:48.752]  Once you make the decision to look at the evidence, which you did do, by the way.
[01:33:48.772 --> 01:33:49.553]  You did research on it.
[01:33:50.053 --> 01:33:59.817]  Once you make the decision to actually go look at it, and then you find out you've been lied to, then you see everything else makes sense, and now you're not mindlessly trusting anymore.
[01:34:00.177 --> 01:34:01.598]  Now you're looking under rocks.
[01:34:02.078 --> 01:34:04.059]  Now you're doing a more thorough investigation.
[01:34:04.279 --> 01:34:08.861]  And see, what happened to Bruce Willis is happening to the whole country right now.
[01:34:09.541 --> 01:34:16.406]  And we were talking during a break, Jim, and you were talking about the fact that you're getting all these emails and calls going, hey, did you know Kennedy really was killed by the government?
[01:34:16.666 --> 01:34:18.267]  Hey, did you know Building 7 fell?
[01:34:18.727 --> 01:34:24.411]  Hey, did you know that there was insider trading and Bush was massing troops outside Afghanistan in the month before?
[01:34:24.431 --> 01:34:25.632]  I mean, now...
[01:34:26.583 --> 01:34:30.887]  And I keep saying every six months, every year, that we're at a new plateau, a new level.
[01:34:31.188 --> 01:34:32.109]  And it's exponential.
[01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:34.711]  Well, now we just went light years ahead of that.
[01:34:35.152 --> 01:34:39.236]  And I'm telling you, one or two more big jumps, it's over, folks.
[01:34:40.657 --> 01:34:41.558]  It's over for them.
[01:34:42.242 --> 01:34:45.604]  And so they're busy telling you you can't win, there's no hope, nobody cares.
[01:34:45.944 --> 01:34:47.204]  They're trying to act arrogant.
[01:34:47.244 --> 01:34:48.105]  No, they're scared now.
[01:34:48.505 --> 01:34:52.907]  Jim, would you agree that we're seeing an actual flashpoint catalyst here?
[01:34:53.507 --> 01:34:54.328]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:34:54.368 --> 01:35:06.754]  In fact, what I look on as quite a hopeful sign is that, I mean, I was there six years after the Kennedy assassination, and it was not considered socially acceptable to even discuss it in public.
[01:35:07.294 --> 01:35:15.158]  And if you said anything other than Oswald did it all by himself, you were basically ostracized and looked on as unpatriotic.
[01:35:15.478 --> 01:35:32.327]  Today, we're six years out from 9-11, and as you say, and it's true, the polls show 50, 60, maybe 70% of the population is no longer buying that official conspiracy theory, which is backed by little or nothing.
[01:35:32.687 --> 01:35:34.268]  So yeah, I find this quite hopeful.
[01:35:35.854 --> 01:35:43.080]  And it's life and death, because if we didn't expose 9-11, they would continue to carry out even bigger attacks and poses as our saviors.
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:45.201]  See, that's the key.
[01:35:45.221 --> 01:35:48.884]  That's why you've got to shoot your mouth off at the grocery store line.
[01:35:49.505 --> 01:35:53.528]  A few nights ago, it was 2 a.m., my wife had asked me to get milk at like 11 when she went to sleep.
[01:35:53.948 --> 01:35:59.652]  I drove home from the office, I went into Randall's, and I walked in, and there were people behind the counter.
[01:35:59.672 --> 01:36:01.814]  I just started talking about 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:36:02.546 --> 01:36:03.987]  Well, hey, here's an experience I had.
[01:36:04.088 --> 01:36:06.870]  I was going through airport security with the TSA guys all over me, okay?
[01:36:06.990 --> 01:36:11.094]  And they're giving me the third degree, wanding me all over the whole thing, and I said, hey guys, I said,
[01:36:27.029 --> 01:36:32.350]  Well, I said, well, why don't you use this kind of stringent security and secure our borders?
[01:36:32.770 --> 01:36:38.492]  If we're supposed to be so fearful of terrorists slipping in the country, how come they're not doing anything to defend the borders?
[01:36:38.872 --> 01:36:42.233]  And I was waiting for these guys to jump all over me instead.
[01:36:42.253 --> 01:36:46.814]  Man, these are big TSA guys, and they're going, yeah, I wondered about that, too.
[01:36:47.294 --> 01:36:47.634]  You know?
[01:36:47.834 --> 01:36:51.435]  So, hey, yeah, people are beginning to kind of snap to it.
[01:36:53.135 --> 01:36:53.736]  Absolutely.
[01:36:53.796 --> 01:36:54.816]  I mean, Bruce Willis,
[01:36:55.689 --> 01:36:56.030]  I think so.
[01:37:10.797 --> 01:37:11.458]  Absolutely.
[01:37:11.498 --> 01:37:15.140]  All you have to do is look at the non-coverage of Texas Congressman Ron Paul, who by all
[01:37:40.719 --> 01:37:41.120]  Exactly!
[01:38:04.762 --> 01:38:08.525]  And yes, yes, they will put stories out about abortion.
[01:38:08.545 --> 01:38:10.527]  They'll put stories out about gay marriage.
[01:38:10.567 --> 01:38:12.869]  Which is all football issues against all fighting.
[01:38:13.329 --> 01:38:14.049]  Exactly.
[01:38:14.610 --> 01:38:19.634]  But you never hear them really get to the heart of things like 9-11 or corporate malfeasance.
[01:38:21.195 --> 01:38:30.042]  And so it's up to us, the individual citizen, to start educating ourselves as to what's really going on and then pass that word along.
[01:38:32.034 --> 01:38:33.736]  Back to the Kennedy assassination.
[01:38:34.076 --> 01:38:42.504]  Some years ago, the secretary of Clint Murchison, the big Texas, powerful Texas oil man, published a small little book that got very little notice.
[01:38:42.944 --> 01:38:46.447]  But in there, she published a lot of the correspondence from Clint Murchison.
[01:38:46.888 --> 01:38:55.556]  And the one that caught my eye was when she said that Clint Murchison was almost in daily contact with Lyndon Johnson and basically telling him what to do.
[01:38:56.136 --> 01:38:56.617]  I don't think so.
[01:39:13.143 --> 01:39:14.484]  With the coup of 1963.
[01:39:14.944 --> 01:39:18.527]  That was not a Republican, Democrat, Conservative, Liberal thing.
[01:39:18.967 --> 01:39:24.171]  That was a controller versus the people action.
[01:39:24.271 --> 01:39:25.432]  And they took over.
[01:39:25.632 --> 01:39:42.684]  Well, Murchison and of course Hunt, not E. Howard Hunt, but the oilman Hunt, and others, it's in mainline history books on Lyndon's rise from Stonewall, Johnson City, right outside Austin, on the way to Fredericksburg, that he literally was groomed and handled
[01:39:43.564 --> 01:39:49.948]  From day one, because he had a family in the legislature, and they were told, boy, we're sending you to Washington, you're going to be president!
[01:39:50.248 --> 01:40:09.358]  That's right, they sent him up there to rescue Brown and Root, that had $12 million sunk into that hydroelectric dam project down in South Texas, and the senator that had rammed it through died, inconveniently, and they were afraid they might lose that, so they picked Johnson to go up there and salvage the project, which he did.
[01:40:10.058 --> 01:40:18.207]  And then a year or two later, he managed to get the big naval base at Corpus Christi, and boy, after that, he was their fair-haired boy.
[01:40:19.617 --> 01:40:21.419]  You're absolutely right about that.
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:32.289]  Let me tell you, everybody wants what we've been taught is the best evidence, which would be the smoking gun, the fingerprints, whatever.
[01:40:33.551 --> 01:40:40.918]  And we've basically been taught that circumstantial evidence may not really be that good, but I want to turn that completely around.
[01:40:41.378 --> 01:40:44.339]  Fingerprints, the smoking gun, all that can be planted.
[01:40:44.419 --> 01:40:45.760]  All that can be fabricated.
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:47.521]  All that can be hidden away.
[01:40:48.321 --> 01:40:50.882]  But the circumstances are the circumstances.
[01:40:50.942 --> 01:40:51.842]  You can't change them.
[01:40:52.423 --> 01:40:54.524]  And so, as a result... Well, it's called motive.
[01:40:54.604 --> 01:40:55.244]  It's called motive.
[01:40:55.444 --> 01:40:55.804]  Motive.
[01:40:56.024 --> 01:40:58.945]  Well, let me tell you a quick story that I think pretty well tells it all.
[01:40:59.726 --> 01:41:10.170]  Some years ago, I was in contact with a fellow whose parents were big in the Democratic Party back in 1963 and had contributed heavily to the party and to Lyndon Johnson's campaign.
[01:41:11.016 --> 01:41:21.008]  And as a result, they were invited to come to a big Johnson cookout at the Johnson Ranch that was scheduled for that Friday night, November 22, 1963.
[01:41:21.549 --> 01:41:25.573]  The presidential party, once they left Dallas, was to go down to the Johnson Ranch.
[01:41:25.934 --> 01:41:28.597]  That was the end of their Texas visit.
[01:41:29.037 --> 01:41:33.019]  And they were going to have a big barbecue at the Texas Ranch of Lyndon Johnson.
[01:41:33.079 --> 01:41:38.521]  Now, I've spoken to many people who've been to those Johnson barbecues, and they were real wing-dings.
[01:41:38.601 --> 01:41:41.282]  I mean, they'd have a whole side of a cow over a spit.
[01:41:41.663 --> 01:41:43.823]  They'd have bands.
[01:41:44.364 --> 01:41:45.764]  They put on a real party.
[01:41:46.184 --> 01:41:51.407]  Okay, so these folks decided on that Friday that they didn't have anything to do.
[01:41:51.447 --> 01:41:52.647]  I believe they lived in Houston.
[01:41:53.107 --> 01:41:56.609]  And they decided they were just going to go ahead and drive over to the Johnson Ranch
[01:41:57.390 --> 01:41:57.830]  I don't know.
[01:42:14.668 --> 01:42:15.769]  And they thought, what the heck?
[01:42:15.809 --> 01:42:17.351]  Did we get the date wrong or something?
[01:42:17.371 --> 01:42:19.213]  So they said, well, this is dumb.
[01:42:19.233 --> 01:42:24.237]  Let's just go back home and we'll wait and then come on back later if it turns out that this is right.
[01:42:24.778 --> 01:42:29.362]  And on the way back to Houston, they heard over the radio that Kennedy had been assassinated in Dallas.
[01:42:30.003 --> 01:42:31.845]  The circumstances do not lie.
[01:42:32.425 --> 01:42:35.909]  Obviously, somebody knew there was not going to be a party that night.
[01:42:38.383 --> 01:42:40.086]  And it just goes on and on from there.
[01:42:40.106 --> 01:42:48.138]  Then we have the newspapers planted before they even knew who Oswald was over on the other side of the globe in New Zealand and other areas.
[01:42:48.639 --> 01:42:48.939]  Right.
[01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:53.426]  And again, to draw parallels, as I'm sure you've well reported,
[01:42:54.066 --> 01:43:03.691]  We now know that CNN and BBC was reporting the collapse of Building 7, World Trade Center Building 7, at least 20 minutes before it fell down.
[01:43:03.971 --> 01:43:04.971]  Well, that's right.
[01:43:05.051 --> 01:43:08.493]  And then the BBC admitted and said, oh, it's just a mistake.
[01:43:09.013 --> 01:43:16.757]  But they were all on two different BBC channels and CNN reporting the exact same thing, clearly reading off teleprompters.
[01:43:17.217 --> 01:43:17.757]  Exactly.
[01:43:17.817 --> 01:43:24.020]  I mean, somebody, that was a slip up, or do you think somebody didn't like what was happening, maybe in black ops and leaked that, or?
[01:43:24.561 --> 01:43:40.748]  Well, it could be either way, but the point is, is that obviously that means somebody had foreknowledge that that building was coming down, and as a result, see if there was a real investigation, we should find out who it was that passed that information that they put on the teleprompter.
[01:43:41.408 --> 01:43:42.268]  And how did they know?
[01:43:42.668 --> 01:43:54.251]  And while we're on that, if you'll recall, Mayor Giuliani had this big, hardened command center in Building 7, but he didn't go there, he went to a temporary command center.
[01:43:54.291 --> 01:44:06.594]  Because they'd already moved out the night before, and the head of FEMA in New York had said that, then he'd retracted it, but then Giuliani later admitted in testimony, yeah, we were running tripod 2 terror attack drill, so we'd moved out the day before.
[01:44:07.134 --> 01:44:14.657]  That's right, and I even saw the head of the FEMA team who was interviewed that day, and he said, yeah, we arrived last night.
[01:44:15.037 --> 01:44:18.898]  So, you know, they were already there, but they didn't go to this command center in Building 7.
[01:44:19.718 --> 01:44:27.621]  They went to a temporary command center on Barclay Street, and while they were there, according to Giuliani, that very afternoon when he's covered with dust and debris,
[01:44:28.081 --> 01:44:32.944]  He said, while we were in there, somebody ran in and said, you've got to evacuate, the Twin Towers are coming down.
[01:44:33.425 --> 01:44:40.009]  And he said they were in the process of evacuating when the towers fell, and they were, of course, caught in all the dust and debris and everything.
[01:44:40.309 --> 01:44:41.350]  Well, here's what's happening.
[01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:44.532]  Well, the question is, who told him they were going to come down?
[01:44:44.872 --> 01:44:45.512]  Exactly.
[01:44:45.612 --> 01:44:48.054]  And how did they know, and why didn't they tell the firemen?
[01:44:48.534 --> 01:44:49.074]  Exactly!
[01:44:50.235 --> 01:44:52.135]  Now, this is hidden in plain view.
[01:44:52.195 --> 01:44:56.317]  It's like last Monday, they officially merged the EU and American Union.
[01:44:56.597 --> 01:44:57.818]  They said they were merging them.
[01:44:57.858 --> 01:44:58.858]  I've read the agreement.
[01:44:59.658 --> 01:45:07.121]  It's a FIAT treaty, Bush signed with Merkel of Germany and Barrusso of the European Commission head president.
[01:45:07.761 --> 01:45:08.862]  And it's not even news!
[01:45:10.143 --> 01:45:15.307]  They got in trouble hiding SPP secretly, the North American merger.
[01:45:15.527 --> 01:45:17.248]  So with this one, it's just out in the open.
[01:45:17.588 --> 01:45:18.729]  It's like FEMA.
[01:45:18.749 --> 01:45:22.552]  Yeah, we were having a terror drill, so we'd moved out the night before.
[01:45:23.032 --> 01:45:25.194]  And yeah, we were told the towers were going to come down.
[01:45:25.254 --> 01:45:27.956]  I mean, we've got them right there, like you said, Jim.
[01:45:28.476 --> 01:45:29.176]  Exactly.
[01:45:29.397 --> 01:45:36.922]  And by the way, the SPP, the Security Prosperity Partnership, and then the thing they just signed, any way you look at it,
[01:45:37.382 --> 01:45:39.945]  These are treaties with foreign countries.
[01:45:40.485 --> 01:45:43.348]  And it's absolutely unconstitutional and treasonous.
[01:45:43.508 --> 01:45:50.375]  Because the Constitution states the President cannot conclude treaties with another country without a two-thirds vote of the Senate.
[01:45:50.475 --> 01:45:52.797]  And he has not gotten that on either one of these deals.
[01:45:53.458 --> 01:45:58.623]  Our country's being sold away, given away, and we're just sitting around on our thumbs.
[01:45:59.156 --> 01:46:00.698]  Not even understanding what's happening.
[01:46:00.718 --> 01:46:01.119]  That's true.
[01:46:01.139 --> 01:46:03.361]  And as they nail down the economics,
[01:46:19.082 --> 01:46:29.320]  The euro, which is backed at least to some extent by gold, is going to get stronger and stronger, and the dollar, which is backed by nothing but nuclear threat, is going to get weaker and weaker.
[01:46:30.066 --> 01:46:32.228]  I just can't believe how bad of shape we're in.
[01:46:32.268 --> 01:46:36.232]  And meanwhile they're talking about Paris Hilton and jail time.
[01:46:36.312 --> 01:46:37.733]  Was she wearing underpants?
[01:46:37.854 --> 01:46:38.474]  I mean, you know.
[01:46:39.075 --> 01:46:41.217]  Yeah, as if that impacts anybody.
[01:46:41.237 --> 01:46:53.008]  And meanwhile, even while we're still dealing with that, the Senate just passed a bill that's handing over our health care to the big pharmaceutical combine.
[01:46:54.012 --> 01:46:56.494]  Yeah, socialized health care for the elites.
[01:46:56.895 --> 01:46:57.175]  Yes.
[01:46:57.335 --> 01:47:01.118]  Where they socialize our wealth for themselves and gobble it out of a big trough.
[01:47:01.559 --> 01:47:02.239]  That's true.
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.362]  And it's just amazing what's going on.
[01:47:05.382 --> 01:47:06.723]  But again, this is what happens
[01:47:07.304 --> 01:47:10.025]  When a public is ignorant, okay?
[01:47:10.125 --> 01:47:11.165]  Now, I didn't say stupid.
[01:47:11.325 --> 01:47:12.146]  I said ignorant.
[01:47:12.186 --> 01:47:12.586]  No, you're right.
[01:47:12.606 --> 01:47:23.249]  We're just like a third world country now, and we've decided that corruption is just the way it is, and well, they all lie, and it's cute, and we're being strip-mined like a third world country, boys and girls.
[01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:25.910]  That's true, and here's the bottom line.
[01:47:26.611 --> 01:47:36.014]  The United States of America, as a sovereign nation, is the biggest stumbling block to the New World Order, a global socialist program, okay?
[01:47:36.074 --> 01:47:36.674]  Because
[01:47:37.356 --> 01:47:40.880]  We have a tradition and history of individual freedom and liberty.
[01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:46.826]  We have a legal basis for that in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and we have guns.
[01:47:47.387 --> 01:47:54.394]  So they've had to kind of play it cozy up until recently, but now with this open-ended war on terror, with wars of aggression around the world,
[01:47:54.918 --> 01:48:00.507]  Yeah, people say the war is about oil, it's about weapons sales, it's about opium, it's about all that, but number one, preeminent
[01:48:09.688 --> 01:48:15.350]  Is the foreign war so they can get the excuse for police states here domestically.
[01:48:16.050 --> 01:48:18.711]  Everything is about policing the people, not the borders.
[01:48:19.091 --> 01:48:20.251]  It's totally transparent.
[01:48:20.291 --> 01:48:21.591]  They're building FEMA camps.
[01:48:22.071 --> 01:48:24.472]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what treason looks like.
[01:48:24.752 --> 01:48:25.793]  We are wide open.
[01:48:26.113 --> 01:48:27.353]  They own both parties.
[01:48:28.613 --> 01:48:33.335]  Going back to those 60s documents where it was Republicans and Democrats, power players splitting it up.
[01:48:33.835 --> 01:48:34.535]  Jim, what do we do?
[01:48:35.622 --> 01:48:39.164]  Well, number one, each individual has to educate themselves.
[01:48:39.204 --> 01:48:40.825]  We all have to be Bruce Willis's.
[01:48:41.245 --> 01:48:44.787]  We have to wake up, snap out of it, and start studying the evidence.
[01:48:44.847 --> 01:48:50.571]  And then once you know the truth, and once you have the facts, then you need to start spreading that around.
[01:48:50.991 --> 01:48:53.092]  Hold book study groups in your home.
[01:48:53.592 --> 01:48:56.354]  If you can afford to hire a hall, hire a hall.
[01:48:56.454 --> 01:48:57.034]  Hold a meeting.
[01:48:57.415 --> 01:48:58.635]  Tell people what's going on.
[01:48:58.735 --> 01:48:59.776]  Bring in other people.
[01:48:59.836 --> 01:49:04.959]  We've got to build a grassroots movement here because it should be painfully obvious
[01:49:05.459 --> 01:49:12.340]  That the time has passed when we can look to anybody in the bought-off Congress to try to stand up and do anything right.
[01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:15.361]  Well, I tell you, the economy is already slowing, I can feel it.
[01:49:16.181 --> 01:49:21.582]  And people need to understand, we expose the governments behind terror, they have to back off.
[01:49:22.082 --> 01:49:25.503]  We expose that they're behind imploding the economy, they may back off.
[01:49:25.563 --> 01:49:28.923]  They want to criminally consolidate it to consolidate your wealth.
[01:49:29.523 --> 01:49:32.324]  It's so important to expose who's behind the economics as well.
[01:49:32.384 --> 01:49:32.964]  Jim, do you agree?
[01:49:33.384 --> 01:49:33.824]  Absolutely.
[01:49:34.523 --> 01:49:36.405]  Absolutely, and that comes back to truth.
[01:49:37.086 --> 01:49:43.913]  Which, you know, whether you're a Democrat, Republican, Liberal, Conservative, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, doesn't matter.
[01:49:44.173 --> 01:49:46.596]  Truth is truth and we should all be working for truth.
[01:49:46.976 --> 01:49:48.538]  Exactly, Veritas is Veritas.
[01:49:48.918 --> 01:49:50.280]  Final segment with Jim, straight ahead.
[01:49:56.807 --> 01:50:02.249]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.630 --> 01:50:10.213]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.962 --> 01:50:18.005]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.405 --> 01:50:29.830]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.150 --> 01:50:33.632]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.112 --> 01:50:35.993]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.373 --> 01:50:40.235]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:55.611 --> 01:51:59.294]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.615 --> 01:52:01.837]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:52:02.357 --> 01:52:08.563]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.723 --> 01:52:13.507]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.807 --> 01:52:22.830]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:53:00.021 --> 01:53:02.782]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:03.182 --> 01:53:06.663]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:53:06.683 --> 01:53:11.244]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:53:11.744 --> 01:53:13.665]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:53:17.828 --> 01:53:19.429]  Final segment with Jim Mars.
[01:53:19.509 --> 01:53:20.750]  It's always great to have him up with us.
[01:53:20.810 --> 01:53:21.831]  We appreciate his time.
[01:53:22.332 --> 01:53:26.375]  The website, ladies and gentlemen, is jimmars.com.
[01:53:26.435 --> 01:53:29.658]  That's jimmars.com with two R's in it.
[01:53:30.058 --> 01:53:31.079]  We carry his book.
[01:53:31.099 --> 01:53:33.300]  We've been carrying it now for about eight, nine months since it came out.
[01:53:33.681 --> 01:53:38.324]  The Terror Conspiracy, Deception, 9-11, and the Loss of Liberty.
[01:53:38.885 --> 01:53:41.247]  And it's full of documents, full of information.
[01:53:42.485 --> 01:53:44.246]  It is an amazing book.
[01:53:44.366 --> 01:53:45.827]  It is, let me see how many pages this is.
[01:53:45.847 --> 01:53:46.067]  500, is it 500?
[01:53:47.207 --> 01:53:47.687]  It's 479 pages.
[01:53:47.707 --> 01:53:48.508]  No, no, 482 pages long.
[01:53:48.528 --> 01:53:49.248]  And it is jam-packed.
[01:53:49.268 --> 01:53:50.909]  Deception, 9-11, and the Loss of Liberty.
[01:54:01.411 --> 01:54:06.877]  Investigative journalist Jim Mars and the Bush Administration both see the attacks of 9-11 as an obvious conspiracy.
[01:54:07.297 --> 01:54:10.080]  The only question is, whose conspiracy was it?
[01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:11.641]  And he covers it all.
[01:54:11.681 --> 01:54:13.743]  It is one of the best books, just like Tarpley's books.
[01:54:13.803 --> 01:54:19.009]  I would put those up there together as two of the best books on the overall operation of 9-11.
[01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:24.274]  And you need to get The Terror Conspiracy at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:25.899 --> 01:54:28.660]  Or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:34.343]  We're carrying a lot of great books and videos on the website, so be sure and check it out.
[01:54:35.223 --> 01:54:49.609]  Jim, what do you see happening in the next month, the next year, the next couple of years, with this... The more people go public, the more documents come out, the more... Now we have one of the operatives involved in the killing of JFK going public.
[01:54:50.549 --> 01:54:53.310]  I mean, I already see it snowballing.
[01:54:53.771 --> 01:54:55.111]  How big will this snowball get?
[01:54:55.551 --> 01:54:59.453]  Well, the danger is that the snowball will backlash, okay?
[01:54:59.533 --> 01:55:00.753]  And here's what I'm talking about.
[01:55:01.614 --> 01:55:11.518]  What I see happening over the next year and a half or so is that more and more information, more and more whistleblowers will come forward until even the most dead-asleep neocon
[01:55:11.938 --> 01:55:16.199]  Is going to wake up and go, holy cow, we've been had by the Bush administration.
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:19.240]  Okay, well that's the good side.
[01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:24.922]  The bad side is that everybody's going to turn around and rush and say, well, I guess we need to vote for a Democrat.
[01:55:25.202 --> 01:55:27.363]  And who's waiting in the wings but Hillary Clinton?
[01:55:27.883 --> 01:55:32.324]  And first I want to make very clear that I'm not opposed to a woman president.
[01:55:32.384 --> 01:55:33.625]  I think it's probably overdue.
[01:55:33.985 --> 01:55:35.205]  But not Hillary Clinton.
[01:55:35.385 --> 01:55:35.686]  Why?
[01:55:35.746 --> 01:55:40.107]  Because in 1992 I reported that she was the first American first lady
[01:55:40.627 --> 01:55:42.829]  To attend those secretive Bilderberg meetings.
[01:55:43.349 --> 01:55:52.036]  Now she didn't just attend the meeting, she was at the front door greeting people when they came in, which is a time-honored way of introducing their protégés to the membership.
[01:55:52.476 --> 01:56:07.548]  So she is lock, stock, and barrel, one of the New World Order, and so they're looking now to swing the pendulum the other way, put Democrats, Clinton, John Edwards, people like that, into power, and yet, if you'll stop and think about it,
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:16.410]  Homeland Security is there, Patriot Act's there, Military Commissions Act is still there, and then you'll have these New World Order people in.
[01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:17.011]  Exactly!
[01:56:17.051 --> 01:56:23.698]  They take all the revolutionary fervor against the tyranny and they just hand the baton over in a tag team to Hillary.
[01:56:23.738 --> 01:56:28.204]  That's why only Ron Paul can win because the other Republicans are totally discredited.
[01:56:28.864 --> 01:56:33.689]  She's going to be the next president, unless we get behind Ron Paul, who won the debates.
[01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:36.512]  Now we've got to force the media to cover this.
[01:56:36.833 --> 01:56:40.977]  Get the article we wrote, Only Ron Paul Can Defeat Hillary Clinton, on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:56:40.997 --> 01:56:44.340]  You just heard Jim Mars say the exact same analysis, because it's the truth.
[01:56:44.721 --> 01:56:47.043]  Jim, I absolutely wholeheartedly agree with you.
[01:56:47.604 --> 01:56:48.825]  Tell folks about your website.
[01:56:49.425 --> 01:56:51.486]  Well, my website is jimmars.com.
[01:56:51.506 --> 01:57:00.168]  You'll find just a whole general array of all kinds of news and information that you probably will not get from the corporate-controlled mass media.
[01:57:00.608 --> 01:57:02.269]  And that's one of the key things.
[01:57:02.289 --> 01:57:05.109]  You asked me a while ago, Alex, about what people can do.
[01:57:05.630 --> 01:57:13.032]  We have got to break the stranglehold of about these four multinational corporations that control everything we see and hear.
[01:57:13.052 --> 01:57:18.133]  They weave an electronic matrix around us, and you've got to break out of that.
[01:57:18.753 --> 01:57:22.416]  And the one way to start is by working on your local media.
[01:57:22.756 --> 01:57:29.460]  Go to your local newspaper, your local radio station, your local TV station, and demand that they start covering the real news.
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:30.341]  I hear ya, Jim.
[01:57:30.381 --> 01:57:31.081]  God bless ya.
[01:57:33.983 --> 01:57:38.206]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7000.
[01:57:49.791 --> 01:57:50.431]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.092 --> 01:57:52.132]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.852 --> 01:57:53.973]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.633 --> 01:57:55.434]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.194 --> 01:57:57.094]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.755 --> 01:58:01.677]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.937 --> 01:58:06.039]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:12.427 --> 01:58:19.889]  David Ray Griffin is a professor emeritus at the Claremont School of Theology, where he taught for over 30 years, retiring in 2004.
[01:58:19.929 --> 01:58:32.192]  He has authored or edited over two dozen books, including God and Religion in the Postmodern World, Religion and Scientific Naturalism, and The New Pearl Harbor, disturbing questions about the Bush administration in 9-11,
[01:58:33.761 --> 01:58:39.265]  And he's written several books, now three books, and been involved with several others on 9-11.
[01:58:39.345 --> 01:58:44.149]  His latest book is Debunking 9-11 Debunking.
[01:58:44.289 --> 01:58:55.358]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, we are carrying the book Debunking 9-11 Debunking, An Answer to Popular Mechanics and the Other Defenders of the Official Conspiracy Theory by David Ray Griffin.
[01:58:55.678 --> 01:58:58.100]  He is with us now for the next 59 minutes.
[01:58:58.740 --> 01:59:00.562]  David, it's great to have you on with us.
[01:59:01.682 --> 01:59:03.543]  Hi Alex, good to be back with you.
[01:59:04.023 --> 01:59:05.204]  It's been a long time.
[01:59:05.224 --> 01:59:07.025]  I really appreciate you spending time with us.
[01:59:08.466 --> 01:59:09.746]  There's just so much to talk about.
[01:59:09.826 --> 01:59:10.987]  So much has come out.
[01:59:11.887 --> 01:59:27.956]  Let's spend a few minutes now, if it's okay with you, getting into what I see as the exponential snowballing or exploding to supernova new levels every few months of 9-11 Truth to now where even Bruce Willis is starting to wake up.
[01:59:27.996 --> 01:59:29.777]  Can you give me your overall view on that?
[01:59:31.217 --> 01:59:56.660]  Well, the last few months have really been remarkable, and I would say the last year as a whole, what has happened is the movement has gone from having a lot of people like me, who are not people with technical expertise, only a few people, you know, physicists, engineers and the such,
[01:59:57.721 --> 02:00:00.664]  And now we have all these new organizations.
[02:00:00.724 --> 02:00:03.086]  So we have veterans for 9-11 Truth.
[02:00:03.146 --> 02:00:08.792]  We have many former military officers who are saying that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:00:09.352 --> 02:00:11.574]  We have pilots for 9-11 Truth.
[02:00:11.654 --> 02:00:16.259]  A growing number of pilots who are saying it just couldn't have happened that way.
[02:00:16.899 --> 02:00:20.703]  We have a new organization called Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[02:00:24.043 --> 02:00:24.764]  Uh, so on.
[02:00:24.884 --> 02:00:34.753]  And so, uh, whereas, uh, NIST and Popular Mechanics like to claim the mantle of expertise and say, all the experts on our side.
[02:00:35.374 --> 02:00:38.076]  That has changed drastically over the last year.
[02:00:39.978 --> 02:00:44.182]  Well, anytime someone says, all the experts agree with us, it should be suspect.
[02:00:44.222 --> 02:00:44.903]  But in truth,
[02:00:45.849 --> 02:00:55.637]  It's like 10 or 15 experts that they've got total in all the government reports that are all in bed with the very regime that was clearly involved in the attacks.
[02:00:55.697 --> 02:01:07.807]  Meanwhile, I can't keep track, David, Ray Griffin, with all the people, the prominent scientists, fighter pilots, commercial pilots, businesses, engineers, that are going public on a daily basis.
[02:01:07.847 --> 02:01:09.329]  I mean, I can't even keep track of it.
[02:01:10.029 --> 02:01:10.810]  Well, that's right.
[02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:14.513]  There are so many more now that have come out for
[02:01:15.069 --> 02:01:23.435]  The 9-11 truth movement, than you have, who have come out explicitly as supporting the official story.
[02:01:24.336 --> 02:01:42.409]  So, it's a completely new situation, and yet, as I show in the introduction and conclusion of my book, the journalists still are pretending that we've got these neutral scientific
[02:01:43.502 --> 02:01:59.610]  Documents that support the official story, ignoring the fact that NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is an agency of the Commerce Department and therefore an agency of the Bush-Cheney administration.
[02:02:00.291 --> 02:02:08.537]  And it's just absurd to think that they, even though they have scientists, could have come out with any report that would contradict the official story.
[02:02:08.637 --> 02:02:13.641]  Well, they continue, and we're going to break and come back and talk about this, to call the 9-11 Commission independent.
[02:02:14.161 --> 02:02:19.805]  I mean, that would be like Al Capone appointing his main capo to be the judge in his trial.
[02:02:20.145 --> 02:02:23.848]  Bush appointed the chairman of that committee, who then appointed their own people.
[02:02:24.511 --> 02:02:28.074]  I mean, that's as independent as Herman Goering is from Hitler.
[02:02:28.414 --> 02:02:38.723]  We'll be right back with David Ray Griffin, debunking 9-11, debunking an amazing new book that we just got in and it's in the shopping cart and store right now.
[02:02:39.124 --> 02:02:42.747]  Get your copy today and a video we carry with David Ray Griffin.
[02:02:45.811 --> 02:02:48.993]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:02:49.013 --> 02:02:53.056]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:02:53.196 --> 02:02:55.758]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:02:55.818 --> 02:02:58.139]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:02:58.340 --> 02:03:06.785]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:03:06.845 --> 02:03:08.166]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:03:08.286 --> 02:03:12.329]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:03:12.349 --> 02:03:12.809]  We're good to go!
[02:03:34.363 --> 02:03:53.851]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:54.211 --> 02:04:01.814]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.549 --> 02:04:09.595]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:10.015 --> 02:04:21.424]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.745 --> 02:04:25.267]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.708 --> 02:04:27.649]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.970 --> 02:04:31.813]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:47.085 --> 02:04:51.227]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:04:51.447 --> 02:04:53.208]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:04:53.468 --> 02:04:59.750]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:05:00.051 --> 02:05:06.173]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:05:06.413 --> 02:05:08.234]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:05:08.234 --> 02:05:08.674]  We're good.
[02:05:24.969 --> 02:05:26.830]  Using pictures are easy to follow.
[02:05:27.010 --> 02:05:29.552]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:05:29.692 --> 02:05:30.772]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:05:31.032 --> 02:05:32.073]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:05:32.213 --> 02:05:34.554]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[02:05:34.574 --> 02:05:34.795]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[02:05:34.815 --> 02:05:34.875]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:05:49.869 --> 02:05:50.509]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.170 --> 02:05:52.250]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:54.071]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.711 --> 02:05:55.532]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.292 --> 02:05:57.153]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.173 --> 02:06:01.755]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.035 --> 02:06:06.157]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.918 --> 02:06:08.739]  Richard Falk?
[02:06:09.973 --> 02:06:26.223]  An extremely prominent professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University said, David Ray Griffin has established himself along Seymour Hersh as America's number one bearer of unpleasant yet necessary public truths.
[02:06:27.043 --> 02:06:29.885]  And you need to get debunking 9-11 debunking.
[02:06:30.645 --> 02:06:34.288]  Because obviously Fox and CNN and everybody else are going to try to ignore it.
[02:06:34.308 --> 02:06:34.968]  We've got to push it.
[02:06:35.786 --> 02:06:36.947]  Over-the-edge demand.
[02:06:36.987 --> 02:06:47.034]  Hey, you've had popular mechanics owned by Hearst Publishing, literally in the encyclopedia, when you look up yellow journalism, next to it is Hearst Publishing.
[02:06:47.914 --> 02:06:52.357]  They were Fox News before Rupert Murdoch was even born.
[02:06:52.497 --> 02:06:56.079]  They were Fox News when Rupert Murdoch's father was a baby.
[02:06:57.677 --> 02:07:02.721]  Okay, I mean, they wrote the book on colluding with the intelligence agencies and government lies.
[02:07:03.122 --> 02:07:05.584]  They built half-truths, straw men, frauds.
[02:07:05.884 --> 02:07:10.928]  Well, he's written a lengthy treatise, and it's a great read, and all of us need this.
[02:07:11.108 --> 02:07:12.089]  I am now reading the book.
[02:07:12.109 --> 02:07:15.312]  I've only read the first few chapters, and I'm learning a lot of things I didn't know.
[02:07:16.193 --> 02:07:21.157]  And because this is such a big field, none of us know everything, and I've learned a lot from David Ray Griffin.
[02:07:21.904 --> 02:07:27.467]  And I'm telling you, you need debunking 9-11 debunking, and it's available at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:27.507 --> 02:07:30.549]  We also have it with a big discount on both the items.
[02:07:31.289 --> 02:07:44.076]  If you get it with the video, 9-11, the myth and the reality, that's a compilation of four and five and six camera shoots with different presentations that David Ray Griffin has put together.
[02:07:44.316 --> 02:07:48.458]  Absolutely amazing piece of video.
[02:07:48.638 --> 02:07:50.379]  Everyone needs to have both of these.
[02:07:51.059 --> 02:07:56.164]  And it's for the general public, but it's also very effective with scholarly individuals.
[02:07:56.605 --> 02:08:06.254]  He is a very measured, I wouldn't call it cautious, but I mean he's just sticking to the facts, and it's extremely scary.
[02:08:06.534 --> 02:08:08.176]  I can now talk about this as well,
[02:08:09.253 --> 02:08:17.898]  I'm not going to talk about myself in involvement with it because I choose to keep that somewhat private at this time because we've got a lot of delicate things going on.
[02:08:18.479 --> 02:08:23.342]  But David Ray Griffin did vet the script for a loose change final cut.
[02:08:23.682 --> 02:08:25.203]  Charlie Sheen is involved.
[02:08:26.563 --> 02:08:31.844]  You know, that's all been in the news that Charlie's involved, but it really hasn't that David Ray Griffin's involved.
[02:08:32.404 --> 02:08:39.466]  And the script is just absolutely amazing, and that film is a rough cut right now, and I've seen large parts of it.
[02:08:39.526 --> 02:08:44.086]  It's an absolutely incredible film, and it's going to be the coup de grace when it comes to 9-11 films.
[02:08:44.526 --> 02:08:52.808]  But going back to Professor David Ray Griffin, please continue, sir, with the implosion of the myth, and then let's get into their
[02:08:53.610 --> 02:08:56.771]  Well, it's just amazing the number of people who should know better.
[02:09:18.314 --> 02:09:21.775]  Who cite Popular Mechanics as some sort of authority.
[02:09:21.795 --> 02:09:25.156]  I mean, they got into this issue very late.
[02:09:26.457 --> 02:09:31.158]  They're not the crew that people had grown to trust over the previous decades.
[02:09:32.358 --> 02:09:46.603]  Kathleen Black, the head of Hearst Corporation, Hearst Publishing, who is married to a former CIA and Department of Defense official,
[02:09:48.075 --> 02:10:13.915]  fired the old editor and much of his staff brought on a brand new editor, James Meggs, and it was this new crew that puts together the article in the Public Mechanics magazine in 2005, which then turned into a little slightly larger book in 2006 called Debunking 9-11 Myths.
[02:10:18.812 --> 02:10:21.273]  So, this was a rushed job.
[02:10:21.353 --> 02:10:40.046]  They threw this stuff together, and they claimed that in that fairly brief period of time, they learned all the essential facts about why the World Trade Center buildings came down, why the planes weren't intercepted, what really happened at the Pentagon, and so on.
[02:10:40.626 --> 02:10:46.450]  And yet, when it comes to young Benjamin Chertoff, who had described himself as the senior
[02:10:47.102 --> 02:10:51.144]  researcher for the magazine version.
[02:10:52.645 --> 02:11:05.831]  They, you know, were in response to the claim that he's the cousin of Michael Chertoff, the then new head of Homeland Security.
[02:11:07.091 --> 02:11:13.054]  And this had been shown by Christopher Bolin, who had called up Ben Chertoff's mother and said,
[02:11:13.815 --> 02:11:16.598]  Um, is he related to Michael Chertoff?
[02:11:16.658 --> 02:11:18.819]  And she says, well, of course he's his cousin.
[02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:26.906]  They try to deny this and say, she said, well, it's possible that he's a distant cousin.
[02:11:27.767 --> 02:11:34.593]  And, uh, you know, they could do all this, but they were not able to discover where their guy on their own staff.
[02:11:35.202 --> 02:11:42.749]  Well, David, I was there as that was all happening, following it closely, as you are, too, but this is exactly what happened.
[02:11:43.390 --> 02:11:49.275]  They called me up, and I've done hundreds of magazine interviews and newspapers, more than hundreds.
[02:11:49.315 --> 02:11:53.579]  I mean, even by then, I'd probably, in the ten years previous, this was two years ago, done a thousand.
[02:11:54.039 --> 02:11:56.321]  I mean, I do them literally three or four times a week or more.
[02:11:56.902 --> 02:11:58.964]  This is the first time I thought it was fake.
[02:11:59.484 --> 02:12:02.126]  They were so unprofessional, stumbling, stuttering.
[02:12:02.426 --> 02:12:04.027]  They sounded like 14-year-olds.
[02:12:04.087 --> 02:12:06.869]  And when I say that, I literally thought it was some prank.
[02:12:06.929 --> 02:12:15.575]  I thought it was like, you know, 9th grade, 10th grade jokers doing some weird literary piece, posing as reporters.
[02:12:15.976 --> 02:12:19.598]  So I called, and Chertoff called me up, and he said, no, no, it's real.
[02:12:19.638 --> 02:12:22.140]  But he sounded, you know, like a frat boy.
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:23.901]  And I might be mean to frat, but you know what I mean.
[02:12:23.941 --> 02:12:26.463]  He sounded pretty, pretty juvenile.
[02:12:27.003 --> 02:12:30.586]  And so I talked to the editor above them, and they said, we swear to you it's not a hit piece.
[02:12:30.606 --> 02:12:31.546]  We give you our word.
[02:12:31.847 --> 02:12:34.228]  It's a balanced piece looking at what you have to say.
[02:12:34.809 --> 02:12:39.532]  Then they said, but we are concerned that you claim that you interviewed this person, and they never said they talked to you.
[02:12:39.872 --> 02:12:42.674]  And I went and looked at the article, and I said, that's somebody else's website that interviewed him.
[02:12:42.694 --> 02:12:43.895]  Did you ask if they talked to him?
[02:12:44.235 --> 02:12:44.956]  And they said, no.
[02:12:44.996 --> 02:12:46.217]  And I said, you better watch it.
[02:12:46.597 --> 02:12:47.658]  I know this is a hit piece.
[02:12:48.451 --> 02:12:52.473]  And then Chertoff went on the Art Bell Show.
[02:12:52.793 --> 02:12:54.995]  People called in and said, are you related to Chertoff?
[02:12:55.015 --> 02:12:56.455]  This is like the day it came out.
[02:12:56.755 --> 02:13:00.057]  He said, no, don't know him, never met him, no relation.
[02:13:00.557 --> 02:13:05.860]  So he's caught lying there because then later they've had to admit, okay, yeah, he's a cousin.
[02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:12.824]  But sorry, I just wanted to add some background personally, David, to just the deceptiveness of these people.
[02:13:13.795 --> 02:13:24.665]  Yeah, and as you can see, if you've gotten to my critique, on almost every point they resort to deception in order to make their point.
[02:13:26.427 --> 02:13:31.252]  Well, I mean, I've never had media... I mean, usually they'll be vague if it's going to be a hit piece and that's fine.
[02:13:31.632 --> 02:13:33.213]  They flat out lied to me, David.
[02:13:33.254 --> 02:13:36.697]  They said, we swear to you that this is not a hit piece.
[02:13:38.772 --> 02:13:46.693]  Yeah, and so this is the piece of the four that I've dealt with in there.
[02:13:47.354 --> 02:13:50.934]  It's the one that by far has gotten the most readership.
[02:13:51.674 --> 02:13:58.396]  And if you look on Amazon and look at their reviews, you see they have fooled lots of people.
[02:13:58.956 --> 02:14:05.437]  But my suspicion is now that now that my book is out, the reviews on
[02:14:06.664 --> 02:14:09.765]  on their book are going to start going down as people see.
[02:14:10.325 --> 02:14:11.586]  Oh, they said this.
[02:14:11.966 --> 02:14:14.207]  This sounded convincing, but now we see.
[02:14:14.247 --> 02:14:24.590]  For example, they claim that we don't even anymore keep fighter jets on alert.
[02:14:24.610 --> 02:14:25.971]  The military doesn't do that.
[02:14:26.791 --> 02:14:34.414]  And they made this point by quoting a former senator, Republican Senator Warren Rudman,
[02:14:35.083 --> 02:14:40.745]  Who said something like, well, we just don't keep armed fighters on alert anymore.
[02:14:40.765 --> 02:14:42.165]  It's just not realistic.
[02:14:42.185 --> 02:14:48.167]  Who, by the way, wrote up the CFR strategy for Homeland Security and was on the Hart-Rudman Commission.
[02:14:48.507 --> 02:14:53.609]  Yeah, but the article then that this was taken from in the Boston Globe
[02:14:54.232 --> 02:15:13.967]  The journalist then went on to say, after quoting Rudman, that, but, you know, at Otis Air Force Base, we have something very close to this, and then described that these planes are on alert 24 hours a day, and they're armed.
[02:15:14.694 --> 02:15:17.155]  And, you know, ready to take off in a few minutes.
[02:15:17.215 --> 02:15:34.619]  They also claim in the same section and on the air constantly that the major, the spokesman for NORAD, said they'd only intercepted one plane in the years before, that being Payne Stewart, the golfer, but then the very same guy was in Reuters saying 160-something times in the year before.
[02:15:34.779 --> 02:15:36.560]  I mean, this is just incredible lying.
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:38.260]  It is really.
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:40.981]  Either they're terribly ignorant,
[02:15:41.767 --> 02:15:54.610]  And just have no sense of journalistic carefulness, or else they are deliberately manipulating the evidence.
[02:15:55.750 --> 02:16:08.953]  And there are many places where one must say, although you hate to accuse people of deliberately trying to deceive people, it certainly looks like that's what they do, because they end that section on interceptions.
[02:16:09.477 --> 02:16:09.777]  I don't know.
[02:16:20.532 --> 02:16:24.473]  There are armed fighters on alert, 24-7.
[02:16:24.713 --> 02:16:29.755]  Well, you know, same with the Kennedy assassination that now everybody knows is an inside job.
[02:16:30.575 --> 02:16:31.655]  It's the same thing here.
[02:16:32.175 --> 02:16:49.800]  The Warren Commission became a blueprint to debunk them, just as the 9-11 Commission did, and it looks like this new Bible they created and put so much faith into with the public, or tried to, is now going to blow up in their face to kingdom come, because the thing is even more shoddy than the 9-11 Commission.
[02:16:51.112 --> 02:16:58.574]  Yeah, let me give another example of something they, with all their money and resources, could have easily checked out.
[02:17:00.135 --> 02:17:14.299]  Key Dudeny, who is a well-known Canadian scientist, a mathematician and computer scientist, who used to write a regular column for Scientific American, so he's well-known, well-respected.
[02:17:14.959 --> 02:17:18.520]  He decided, let's do some experiments with cell phones.
[02:17:19.204 --> 02:17:24.067]  And see if it's conceivable that all those alleged cell phone calls could have occurred.
[02:17:26.148 --> 02:17:27.788]  Tell us what he discovered, David.
[02:17:27.808 --> 02:17:29.229]  Tell us what he discovered on the other side.
[02:17:29.269 --> 02:17:31.570]  I'd like to speak to you in the break here in just a moment, sir.
[02:17:31.831 --> 02:17:33.431]  We'll be right back with David Ray Griffin.
[02:17:33.792 --> 02:17:35.853]  The new book is Debunking 9-11 Debunkers.
[02:17:35.913 --> 02:17:38.154]  Available at Infowars.com.
[02:17:38.194 --> 02:17:41.535]  We also have the video, 9-11, the myth and the reality.
[02:17:41.836 --> 02:17:42.236]  Stay with us.
[02:17:46.010 --> 02:17:46.991]  How are you doing today?
[02:17:47.211 --> 02:17:47.671]  Why ask?
[02:17:47.711 --> 02:17:53.794]  Because if you have health challenges, then reading our free e-booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[02:17:54.034 --> 02:17:58.437]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call Mangosteen.
[02:17:58.737 --> 02:18:04.300]  It's a century-old medicinal fruit whose time has come, and it has amassed 40 years of published research.
[02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:09.601]  We have information and testimonials from all over the world about the health potential of this amazing fruit.
[02:18:09.821 --> 02:18:16.243]  The powerful botanical has contributed to the well-being of millions of people the world over with health concerns just like yours.

[02:18:24.165 --> 02:18:26.326]  Could this fruit help you in your quest for total health?
[02:18:26.586 --> 02:18:34.188]  Find out why Mangosteen is known as the Queen of All Fruits and why it's fast becoming the best-selling wellness product ever brought to the market.
[02:18:34.588 --> 02:18:36.029]  Your health is in your hands.
[02:18:36.329 --> 02:18:37.529]  Do something about it today.
[02:18:37.810 --> 02:18:38.490]  Call 800-658-0597.
[02:18:38.510 --> 02:18:42.672]  Again, that's 800-658-0597.
[02:18:42.852 --> 02:18:49.075]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:49.435 --> 02:18:51.476]  Here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:52.637 --> 02:18:57.479]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:57.679 --> 02:19:00.400]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:01.541]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:19:02.893 --> 02:19:07.494]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:08.414 --> 02:19:15.675]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:19:16.676 --> 02:19:19.736]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:19:19.976 --> 02:19:25.357]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:19:26.337 --> 02:19:27.597]  Call for your copy today.
[02:19:27.657 --> 02:19:27.818]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:31.110 --> 02:19:36.960]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:19:37.541 --> 02:19:37.721]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:37.741 --> 02:19:38.042]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.464 --> 02:19:50.546]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:19:50.606 --> 02:19:57.928]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:19:58.068 --> 02:20:08.691]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:20:08.892 --> 02:20:13.453]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:20:13.733 --> 02:20:18.719]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[02:20:18.939 --> 02:20:21.882]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:22.102 --> 02:20:31.933]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black burkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[02:20:32.433 --> 02:20:46.257]  Attention gardeners!
[02:20:46.317 --> 02:20:48.678]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[02:20:48.918 --> 02:20:53.239]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:21:01.322]  It's called Proto Grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[02:21:01.642 --> 02:21:04.463]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[02:21:04.743 --> 02:21:12.287]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[02:21:12.387 --> 02:21:17.989]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[02:21:18.209 --> 02:21:23.772]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[02:21:24.052 --> 02:21:27.353]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[02:21:27.593 --> 02:21:30.935]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[02:21:31.175 --> 02:21:36.219]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dervsheet Superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:39.122]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:21:39.162 --> 02:21:39.342]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:21:39.362 --> 02:21:41.604]  David Ray Griffin, author of Debunking 9-11 Debunking, is our guest.
[02:21:41.784 --> 02:21:42.425]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:21:55.374 --> 02:22:01.581]  Understand, we have to fight back against popular mechanics for their lies, their deception, and I'll say it, they are a pack of liars.
[02:22:01.961 --> 02:22:02.922]  They're yellow journalists.
[02:22:02.962 --> 02:22:07.968]  That thing has every earmark and signature and wavelength and footprint.
[02:22:09.067 --> 02:22:13.788]  And smell of a black op, of a gaggle of disinfo artists.
[02:22:13.808 --> 02:22:17.829]  We know Bush has spent tens of billions in fake news.
[02:22:17.849 --> 02:22:19.830]  $1.8 billion just on one fake ad package.
[02:22:20.370 --> 02:22:25.571]  And we know that a lot of people we see on the news are paid by the CIA, Department of Justice, and other groups.
[02:22:26.112 --> 02:22:31.273]  Regardless, Hearst Publishing, you heard about the lady that runs it, her husband, a big black op operator.
[02:22:32.213 --> 02:22:33.574]  I mean, that's how the thing was written.
[02:22:33.674 --> 02:22:35.375]  I've never experienced anything like this.
[02:22:35.896 --> 02:22:38.617]  David Ray Griffin, there's so many things you debunk in your book.
[02:22:39.057 --> 02:22:47.843]  People gotta get it, though, because they have to have the knowledge, not just of what happened on 9-11 now, but of how to counter the debunkers.
[02:22:48.363 --> 02:22:52.404]  Well, it's just a matter of getting empirical, because all the facts are on our side.
[02:23:13.260 --> 02:23:14.620]  They try to claim that.
[02:23:15.701 --> 02:23:27.404]  At the introduction, they've got John McCain giving the foreword to their book, saying that these guys do science, they don't engage in speculation, they just go for the facts, and so on.
[02:23:27.424 --> 02:23:29.724]  And we're not political, we don't have a dog in the park!
[02:23:31.025 --> 02:23:33.805]  Right, but let's take this example of the cell phone.
[02:23:33.885 --> 02:23:39.507]  So Dudney went up with his single-engine plane, and then a double-engine plane.
[02:23:40.054 --> 02:23:48.176]  And found that using the kind of cell phones they had in 2001, you couldn't get a signal above 7 or 8,000 feet.
[02:23:48.996 --> 02:24:00.578]  In a big airliner, with all that shielding, all the anecdotal evidence suggests you can't get one much above 1,000 or 1,500, certainly not above 2,000 feet.
[02:24:00.698 --> 02:24:01.198]  And yet all these
[02:24:05.652 --> 02:24:10.336]  calls were allegedly made at 30,000 to 40,000 feet.
[02:24:10.956 --> 02:24:15.360]  So he said those, you know, from his experiments were flat out impossible.
[02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:17.021]  So what popular mechanics do?
[02:24:17.562 --> 02:24:19.704]  Did they go perform some experiments?
[02:24:20.164 --> 02:24:30.753]  No, they found two what they called experts in 2006, who would say, on record, well, those calls were possible.
[02:24:31.252 --> 02:24:31.912]  And that's it.
[02:24:31.972 --> 02:24:36.814]  That's how they refute all of his experiments and all the anecdotal evidence.
[02:24:36.834 --> 02:24:44.938]  Well, everybody I know, and I've done it probably 20 times, I'm not exaggerating, in the last five and a half years, every time I take off,
[02:24:46.597 --> 02:25:00.387]  I have sat there and dialed, I know you're not supposed to, and at about 1,500 feet, and I know because I can tell how tall the radio towers are, I've asked at the airport, at about 1,500 feet the phone cuts out, if you can even get a signal.
[02:25:00.827 --> 02:25:07.812]  At a lot of airports, because of the shielding and other waves, I'm not sure why, a lot of times they won't even work in the planes.
[02:25:09.654 --> 02:25:14.377]  Yeah, and so the, you know, what that means is that
[02:25:15.449 --> 02:25:32.437]  One of the central pillars of the official story, the idea that passengers called their relatives and reported that they were being hijacked and there were these hijackers in the plane, it means that there is no empirical evidence for that.
[02:25:32.537 --> 02:25:36.799]  That was the evidence that there were hijackers on the plane.
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:41.762]  And once you realize those cell phone calls could not have occurred, then
[02:25:42.881 --> 02:25:44.562]  That just completely undercuts that.
[02:25:44.622 --> 02:25:51.086]  Now you might say, well some of the phone calls were allegedly made on feedback phones, and certainly those were possible.
[02:25:51.806 --> 02:25:58.570]  But when you see that the content of those calls were, that they were essentially the same as the cell phone calls.
[02:25:58.650 --> 02:26:03.953]  If the cell phone calls were faked, we can conclude the feedback calls were faked.
[02:26:04.013 --> 02:26:06.595]  And particularly when you look at the content of them,
[02:26:07.170 --> 02:26:09.812]  They do not sound like authentic calls.
[02:26:09.872 --> 02:26:11.613]  Hey, Mom, this is blah blah.
[02:26:12.394 --> 02:26:13.695]  You believe me, don't you?
[02:26:13.715 --> 02:26:16.777]  And the people said it was all like one way.
[02:26:16.797 --> 02:26:17.757]  It was talking at them.
[02:26:19.198 --> 02:26:19.799]  Yeah.
[02:26:19.999 --> 02:26:30.526]  And another example besides that, that famous one, Tom Burnett allegedly called his wife Dina four times and from Flight 93.
[02:26:30.646 --> 02:26:32.027]  And on the last one,
[02:26:33.621 --> 02:26:46.486]  He was telling her, well, you know, it looks like they're going to take this in and crash it, so a bunch of us are going to get together and crash the plane over the rural area.
[02:26:47.206 --> 02:26:55.449]  And so here he knew he was going to die, and he's talking to his wife, and then she says, well, the kids are right here, they want to talk to you.
[02:26:55.469 --> 02:26:59.251]  And he says, oh, no, tell them I'll talk to them later.
[02:27:00.051 --> 02:27:06.712]  Can you imagine anybody who was in his last moments would turn down a chance to talk to his kids?
[02:27:07.032 --> 02:27:07.452]  Exactly.
[02:27:07.993 --> 02:27:11.233]  I'll be crashing in the rural area, talk to you later.
[02:27:11.253 --> 02:27:16.854]  Oh my gosh.
[02:27:17.254 --> 02:27:18.254]  Hey mom, it's me.
[02:27:18.835 --> 02:27:19.435]  You believe me?
[02:27:19.455 --> 02:27:20.855]  You believe it's your son, don't you?
[02:27:22.335 --> 02:27:23.916]  Yeah, using your last name.
[02:27:25.156 --> 02:27:26.196]  I mean, this is just...
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:33.288]  And again, folks, they have off-the-shelf software that can mimic voices to a tee right now.
[02:27:35.892 --> 02:27:36.813]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.294 --> 02:27:38.896]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.817 --> 02:27:42.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.885 --> 02:27:49.469]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:27:49.730 --> 02:27:50.591]  Look no further!
[02:27:50.891 --> 02:27:53.454]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:27:53.895 --> 02:28:02.404]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:28:02.565 --> 02:28:03.746]  You can order everything you need
[02:28:03.826 --> 02:28:04.286]  I think so.
[02:28:20.171 --> 02:28:21.012]  We're good to go.
[02:28:45.652 --> 02:28:49.694]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:28:49.914 --> 02:28:53.316]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:28:53.497 --> 02:28:57.019]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:28:57.239 --> 02:29:00.541]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:29:00.641 --> 02:29:05.984]  This basic tenant of yeast and the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:29:06.004 --> 02:29:11.227]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[02:29:11.667 --> 02:29:12.247]  I think so.
[02:29:29.099 --> 02:29:39.101]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[02:29:40.681 --> 02:29:42.341]  1-877-928-8822.
[02:29:46.242 --> 02:29:48.742]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:29:49.423 --> 02:29:53.043]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[02:29:53.683 --> 02:29:57.484]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[02:29:58.251 --> 02:30:06.857]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[02:30:07.798 --> 02:30:15.003]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[02:30:15.923 --> 02:30:24.009]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:30:25.146 --> 02:30:28.389]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:30:28.449 --> 02:30:28.689]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:30:28.729 --> 02:30:29.870]  Call now.
[02:30:29.930 --> 02:30:32.612]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:30:51.704 --> 02:30:54.266]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[02:30:54.306 --> 02:30:56.647]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[02:30:56.707 --> 02:30:59.669]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[02:30:59.749 --> 02:31:03.432]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lift to Big John.
[02:31:05.133 --> 02:31:06.854]  Big John.
[02:31:07.895 --> 02:31:10.196]  Big John.
[02:31:10.717 --> 02:31:12.358]  Big Bad John.
[02:31:13.299 --> 02:31:14.499]  Monday through Friday 11 to 2 Central.
[02:31:16.861 --> 02:31:18.365]  We're here live.
[02:31:18.625 --> 02:31:24.038]  Don't forget, we re-stream the show to the internet 24 hours a day at InfoWars.com.
[02:31:24.058 --> 02:31:26.965]  The three-hour live show ends, 21 hours consecutively.
[02:31:27.834 --> 02:31:32.476]  It streams out to literally hundreds of thousands a week that listen over the web.
[02:31:33.036 --> 02:31:34.477]  Hundreds of thousands total a day.
[02:31:34.797 --> 02:31:37.758]  Hundreds of thousands have subscribed off and on to the podcast.
[02:31:38.098 --> 02:31:39.118]  Don't forget, it's free.
[02:31:39.158 --> 02:31:43.800]  The three hours serves out every day at the end of the show to your MP3 or iPod device.
[02:31:44.160 --> 02:31:48.202]  Just go hit subscribe at InfoWars.com in the listen section.
[02:31:49.005 --> 02:32:05.469]  We not only carry in the online video and bookstore shopping cart debunking 9-11 debunkers by our guest David Ray Griffin, Professor David Ray Griffin Emeritus, we also carry a great video and it's 9-11 the myth and the reality.
[02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:21.798]  And it is a compilation of the speeches and information of David Ray Griffin, composed of two powerful speeches given by the masterful philosopher and theologian, Dr. David Ray Griffin, at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco and the Grand Lake Theater in Oakland.
[02:32:22.719 --> 02:32:29.562]  On 9-11, the myth and reality exposes the official story of 9-11 for what it truly is, a sacred myth.
[02:32:29.622 --> 02:32:30.363]  And they know this.
[02:32:30.723 --> 02:32:34.385]  They introduced it as a sacred myth, with all of the trappings.
[02:32:34.865 --> 02:32:39.867]  They understand the power of archetypal myths, and it is an extremely powerful video.
[02:32:39.967 --> 02:32:41.647]  You need to have it.
[02:32:42.087 --> 02:32:43.868]  And then, of course, the book.
[02:32:43.928 --> 02:32:45.088]  It's a great one to punch.
[02:32:45.569 --> 02:32:47.929]  And that is Debunking 9-11 Debunking.
[02:32:48.189 --> 02:32:50.010]  If you get the two together, you get a big discount.
[02:32:50.370 --> 02:32:52.871]  Again, at mfowards.com or by calling toll-free.
[02:32:54.199 --> 02:32:57.900]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:32:58.601 --> 02:33:06.484]  And while you're at it, get Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C., 9-11, Press for Truth, my new film, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:33:08.104 --> 02:33:09.005]  It is my newest video.
[02:33:09.065 --> 02:33:15.227]  It came out last July, and this next July, in just two months, it won't be available anymore.
[02:33:16.218 --> 02:33:21.959]  There is about 900 of Terror Storm left here at my office and less than a thousand at Amazon.com.
[02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:32.002]  It's gone as high as number eight on the total Amazon list, number one in documentaries for a full week, beating Inconvenient Truth by Al Gorb, and it's going back up the charts again.
[02:33:32.062 --> 02:33:33.982]  It's going to be gone very, very soon.
[02:33:34.022 --> 02:33:43.665]  If you want the first edition of Terror Storm, the second cut, Terror Storm cut number two, with 17 minutes of extra video, updated, new music,
[02:33:44.265 --> 02:33:45.105]  It's really incredible.
[02:33:45.145 --> 02:33:53.808]  It's coming out in late July, but if you want the original Terror Storm, it's available at InfoWars.com or at Amazon.com or by calling that same toll-free number.
[02:33:54.128 --> 02:34:10.134]  If you'd like to talk to our guest, David Ray Griffin, the toll-free number specifically on 9-11 or false flag terror for our guest or the Popular Mechanics Hearst Publishing CIA hit piece, the toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231 and Richard in Texas and others will go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[02:34:13.936 --> 02:34:17.945]  There's so many other examples that we're going to try to cover here and hopefully encourage you to get the book.
[02:34:18.927 --> 02:34:22.836]  Mr. Griffin, looking out into the future,
[02:34:24.389 --> 02:34:29.334]  And speaking about the myth and how they install that myth, but first, what do you see on the tea leaves?
[02:34:29.354 --> 02:34:33.657]  I mean, I know you just follow the facts and the information, but you're a smart guy.
[02:34:33.677 --> 02:34:37.681]  You've lived a long life, and you've been, you know, in some high circles and talked to a lot of people.
[02:34:38.081 --> 02:34:44.527]  What do you see this current elite doing that is trying to hurdle us towards World War III, and could they stage another attack?
[02:34:44.567 --> 02:34:45.688]  What are your biggest fears?
[02:34:45.728 --> 02:34:49.892]  And then, what also buoys your soul, you know, in the middle of the night?
[02:34:50.392 --> 02:34:51.373]  Where do you see things going?
[02:34:53.457 --> 02:35:00.342]  Well, kind of like Yogi Berra, I don't make predictions, especially about the future, as he put it.
[02:35:02.323 --> 02:35:04.104]  So I really don't know.
[02:35:05.145 --> 02:35:06.766]  I have my hopes, of course.
[02:35:07.547 --> 02:35:08.928]  I have my hopes.
[02:35:09.708 --> 02:35:22.957]  You know, that event that occurred yesterday with mainstream Republican Congress people going in to talk to Bush and say, look, things are getting really bad here.
[02:35:23.479 --> 02:35:27.962]  We're going to go down to defeat, unless you change your ways in Iraq.
[02:35:28.923 --> 02:35:46.277]  I think something like this may occur on a grander scale with regard to 9-11, like it did with Nixon and Watergate, where the elite of the country decided, this is really destroying America.
[02:35:46.337 --> 02:35:47.858]  We're losing our reputation.
[02:35:47.878 --> 02:35:49.039]  He has to go.
[02:35:49.099 --> 02:35:49.499]  It may be.
[02:35:55.937 --> 02:36:10.461]  That they will realize the only way to recover America's reputation is to expose 9-11, give at least the appearance of weeding out the corruption and the problem.
[02:36:12.202 --> 02:36:12.802]  I don't know.
[02:36:12.822 --> 02:36:15.823]  I mean, I certainly wouldn't predict that would happen.
[02:36:15.923 --> 02:36:18.284]  I think there's a possibility that it would happen.
[02:36:20.467 --> 02:36:30.554]  If 9-11 continues to exponentially grow, which by every yardstick it's exploding, when do you think a probable time for that flashpoint to occur?
[02:36:30.634 --> 02:36:36.578]  Or will they try to coast out and just let Bush leave and then install the equally warmongering Hillary Clinton?
[02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:44.664]  Well, again, I don't know and I don't spend much time thinking about that sort of thing.
[02:36:45.445 --> 02:36:47.206]  I just think all we can do
[02:36:47.947 --> 02:36:50.309]  Is keep doing what we've been doing.
[02:36:50.429 --> 02:36:52.911]  Let justice be done, though the heavens may fall.
[02:36:53.511 --> 02:36:59.936]  Yeah, because, you know, as you say, we have been amazingly successful.
[02:37:00.777 --> 02:37:15.288]  I would guess that now, if a new Zogby poll were taken, we would be up in the 40s in terms of those who would say it was deliberately allowed or orchestrated by the Bush administration.
[02:37:15.328 --> 02:37:16.389]  We already know that
[02:37:17.304 --> 02:37:23.928]  Forty-two percent believe they have been lied to, to some degree, by the 9-11 Commission.
[02:37:24.388 --> 02:37:35.114]  But that 37 percent we had for last year, of those who believed it was an inside job, at least partially, I suspect that's up in the 40s now.
[02:37:36.315 --> 02:37:43.459]  Now, that's people who, when they got a Scripps Howard News Service call, do you believe the government was behind it, or were elements?
[02:37:44.595 --> 02:37:54.980]  I mean, with polling sciences, normally people will, and even with their quote, viewing habits and with the rating services, they found that people are embarrassed and won't answer truthfully.
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:58.001]  They'll answer in the more conservative vein.
[02:37:58.362 --> 02:38:02.624]  And so I would imagine that if you really got honest poll numbers, it'd be much higher than that.
[02:38:03.924 --> 02:38:04.765]  It might well be.
[02:38:04.785 --> 02:38:11.808]  So in any case, given the polls and given the fact that we have now drawn so many
[02:38:12.509 --> 02:38:19.110]  People with professional expertise relevant to 9-11 into the movement.
[02:38:19.871 --> 02:38:23.131]  It's so much stronger than it was a year ago.
[02:38:23.211 --> 02:38:28.413]  Let me give another example of this and of Popular Mechanics.
[02:38:29.513 --> 02:38:39.535]  They deal with the most difficult question with regard to the strike on the Pentagon was how in the world could Honey Honjour
[02:38:40.168 --> 02:38:58.426]  Who could barely fly a little Piper Cub, have gotten into this giant airplane, he had never been in one before, fly it all the way back to Washington, and then go through this amazing trajectory to come in at ground level and strike the Pentagon.
[02:39:00.027 --> 02:39:03.771]  Here's what Paul B. Mechanics says, well no problem, you know,
[02:39:04.617 --> 02:39:14.065]  He wasn't great, but really all he had to do was use the GPS system, punch in the numbers, and let the plane fly itself back to Washington.
[02:39:14.465 --> 02:39:18.288]  And really, he only did it manually the last eight minutes.
[02:39:18.969 --> 02:39:30.298]  What they don't mention to their readers is during that last eight minutes, Honey Honjour reportedly did the impossible with that airplane.
[02:39:30.768 --> 02:39:46.095]  So now we have pilots in the movement, and I quote a couple of them in the book, who say, and there's 757 qualified pilots who've got, one of them, 35 years of experience, who say, I don't think I could have flown that trajectory.
[02:39:46.516 --> 02:39:49.617]  The idea that Honey Honjour could have is absolutely ridiculous.
[02:39:49.637 --> 02:39:55.780]  Well, it's also come out that they've tried to do this in simulators, and nine times out of ten, the instructors can't do it.
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:39:59.462]  That's right, and so here you have another example
[02:39:59.955 --> 02:40:02.696]  Or the whole story crashes.
[02:40:03.296 --> 02:40:09.818]  You know, if you have to say, okay, we lied when we said Honey Honjour.
[02:40:10.518 --> 02:40:14.479]  If they have to say that, then the whole story about the Pentagon goes.
[02:40:15.420 --> 02:40:21.762]  If people know they were lying about the Pentagon, then they're going to say, well, were you lying about the World Trade Center too?
[02:40:21.982 --> 02:40:23.082]  And on and on and on.
[02:40:23.802 --> 02:40:26.663]  And so, the cell phones, Honey Honjour.
[02:40:27.083 --> 02:40:29.524]  Likewise, if you go to the World Trade Center,
[02:40:30.382 --> 02:40:33.063]  Uh, what do they do with the empirical evidence?
[02:40:34.164 --> 02:40:48.891]  Uh, from, you know, we have over about 150 people, at least, who testified to hearing, uh, explosives in the building going off, either before or during the, uh, the disintegration of the powers.
[02:40:49.912 --> 02:40:54.694]  And yet, NIST and Popular Mechanics simply ignores these.
[02:40:55.255 --> 02:40:57.436]  That's what they do with empirical evidence.
[02:40:58.216 --> 02:40:59.817]  Likewise with the molten metal.
[02:41:00.430 --> 02:41:09.473]  They know there's no way to account for a molten metal because steel does not begin to melt until 2800 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:41:10.434 --> 02:41:14.475]  And the fire could not have come within 1000 degrees of that.
[02:41:15.336 --> 02:41:18.557]  And so NIST for the most part simply tries to deny
[02:41:19.116 --> 02:41:21.059]  That there was any molten metal found underneath.
[02:41:36.252 --> 02:41:38.634]  Well, it is crazy, and it's got so many completely vulnerable spots.
[02:42:02.455 --> 02:42:13.337]  But I think that's right, that, you know, looking back at the JFK assassination, that was obviously absurd, too, for anybody who would look at the evidence.
[02:42:13.957 --> 02:42:18.838]  And yet, because they did control the media, they could get away with it.
[02:42:18.878 --> 02:42:20.959]  I mean, the media are still controlled on this.
[02:42:22.079 --> 02:42:28.040]  If you say anything suggesting that it wasn't Lee Harvey Oswald operating alone, or virtually alone,
[02:42:29.115 --> 02:42:34.902]  You're called part of the grassy knoll crowd on the mainstream, even though 80% of the people think it.
[02:42:34.942 --> 02:42:38.446]  So yeah, I think so, and thus far they've turned out to be right.
[02:42:38.506 --> 02:42:44.853]  That is, thus far, it has not become part of the public discussion in America.
[02:42:45.454 --> 02:42:48.097]  If it does not become part of the public discussion,
[02:42:48.721 --> 02:42:52.324]  Even if 50% of the people know it, nothing happens.
[02:42:52.464 --> 02:42:53.565]  Nothing is done about it.
[02:42:53.746 --> 02:42:58.830]  You're a philosopher as well as a theologian, and I think this is a good question for you.
[02:42:58.910 --> 02:43:01.352]  I've certainly pondered it, but I know the answer.
[02:43:01.833 --> 02:43:08.799]  Generals throughout history will put a thousand, ten thousand troops in a gully to use them as bait, like I'd use a worm on a fish hook.
[02:43:09.199 --> 02:43:12.720]  To draw in the enemy to catch the larger force in a trap and kill them.
[02:43:13.140 --> 02:43:29.945]  So if generals make decisions to kill thousands as just due course and then walk off and have lunch at the staff bunker, then why wouldn't the very same mindset say, well, we're doing this for the greater American century and millions will die if we don't and all the excuses.
[02:43:30.405 --> 02:43:34.127]  I mean, isn't that really how they could have the nerve to kill 2,800 and something people?
[02:43:36.237 --> 02:43:36.757]  Oh, sure.
[02:43:36.797 --> 02:43:43.240]  There's no question about their capacity to do that, and I raised that in my introductory chapter.
[02:43:43.260 --> 02:43:50.102]  I begin by saying the evidence is overwhelming that it was an inside job.
[02:43:50.142 --> 02:43:53.043]  The only task is to get people to look at the evidence.
[02:43:53.663 --> 02:44:01.666]  So I go through a bunch of a priori reasons people will give for saying, well, we don't need to look at the evidence because we know it couldn't have happened.
[02:44:01.746 --> 02:44:05.227]  And one of those is, well, we know the Bush administration wouldn't have done this.
[02:44:05.953 --> 02:44:17.615]  But if you look at what they did after 9-11, at Ground Zero, they deliberately told the APA to lie to the public.
[02:44:17.655 --> 02:44:22.776]  The EPA was going to put out a fairly honest report and say the air was dangerous.
[02:44:22.796 --> 02:44:25.616]  There was an enormous amount of asbestos in the air.
[02:44:26.517 --> 02:44:32.078]  And yet the White House ordered them to tone it down and actually tell people the air was safe.
[02:44:32.178 --> 02:44:34.658]  Now, more people are going to die
[02:44:35.367 --> 02:44:40.833]  From the workers at Ground Zero, the 40,000 of them, then died on 9-11 itself.
[02:44:41.593 --> 02:44:43.075]  This was cold-blooded murder.
[02:44:44.056 --> 02:44:47.239]  And they just do it and go play another game of golf.
[02:44:47.399 --> 02:44:49.381]  It's just cold-bloodedly done.
[02:44:50.863 --> 02:44:54.246]  I'm afraid that's the way of the world, including the United States.
[02:44:54.306 --> 02:44:57.129]  We are not an exceptional nation in that respect.
[02:44:57.575 --> 02:45:02.516]  But the paradox here, the quandary, that generally the general public isn't like that.
[02:45:02.556 --> 02:45:05.357]  People I know, the average person wouldn't consciously do that.
[02:45:05.797 --> 02:45:08.578]  It seems like it's a leadership trait to be cold-blooded.
[02:45:09.158 --> 02:45:17.401]  I mean, and it's not a leadership trait in the positive, it just seems more often than not we get tyrants, and I just don't know how we deal with that larger question.
[02:45:18.981 --> 02:45:20.342]  These are large questions.
[02:45:21.162 --> 02:45:25.343]  Certainly there is a tendency for a certain type of person
[02:45:26.041 --> 02:45:33.486]  to gravitate to leadership positions, and they learn along the way that you have to be tough.
[02:45:33.766 --> 02:45:38.328]  And if you don't have a reputation of being tough, you won't be advanced.
[02:45:38.429 --> 02:45:47.294]  And so you may do things that, at least at first, greatly disturb your conscience, but people tend to get over that.
[02:45:47.374 --> 02:45:48.154]  Harden their hearts.
[02:45:50.328 --> 02:45:57.011]  Absolutely, and those callouses get so thick where you can be like Joe Stalin or Hitler and you don't even notice millions you're killing.
[02:45:57.912 --> 02:46:12.079]  And likewise, we do have testimonies from Vietnam, from all sorts of places, where people really did feel terrible about what they were doing, but they said, I'm in the army, I'm in the government, I have to obey orders.
[02:46:12.999 --> 02:46:18.242]  And that has become a very powerful force.
[02:46:18.746 --> 02:46:22.928]  leading people to do things that in their private lives they would never think of doing.
[02:46:23.009 --> 02:46:27.371]  Oh yeah, it's almost like a mantle or a cloak they put on of invisibility to themselves.
[02:46:27.851 --> 02:46:32.574]  And I mean, I've seen cops arresting protesters for no reason, doing bad things, and they go, well, it's my job.
[02:46:32.894 --> 02:46:36.336]  No, your job is to uphold the Constitution and Bill of Rights you swore to.
[02:46:36.696 --> 02:46:39.718]  Richard and then Clint and then Kyles, all we got time for.
[02:46:41.019 --> 02:46:42.600]  Let's go ahead and talk to Richard in Texas.
[02:46:42.880 --> 02:46:44.161]  You're on the air with David Ray Griffin.
[02:46:44.181 --> 02:46:44.501]  Go ahead.
[02:46:45.074 --> 02:46:46.515]  Hey guys, pleasure to talk to you.
[02:46:46.855 --> 02:46:53.378]  Along those same lines in terms of how people get caught up in this stuff, I don't know if either of you have seen the film The Good Shepherd.
[02:46:53.438 --> 02:46:57.160]  It's a Matt Damon film and recently came out in the rental stores.
[02:46:57.780 --> 02:47:00.062]  It's about the founding of the CIA.
[02:47:00.902 --> 02:47:01.382]  I don't
[02:47:19.048 --> 02:47:20.770]  Do you have a question or comment for the guest?
[02:47:32.209 --> 02:47:36.512]  Well, one thing I'd like to find out about is your feeling about the polls that are going on.
[02:47:36.532 --> 02:47:53.002]  You know, I think the situation, whether it's 9-11 or Ron Paul, you know, there's a lot of Internet activists and it's a wonderful sign to see us doing this great job of spreading the word and voting for these things, but to me it's skewed somewhat by the fact that the activists are so good at getting the word around.
[02:47:53.022 --> 02:47:55.643]  I don't find that to be the case.
[02:47:55.703 --> 02:47:56.124]  I've done
[02:47:57.046 --> 02:48:04.673]  Over 4,000 interviews on radio and liberal conservative Christian stations, and I found it's even much better than what the polls show.
[02:48:04.693 --> 02:48:05.453]  David?
[02:48:06.254 --> 02:48:10.157]  Let me make a comment about the CIA, because that's another example.
[02:48:10.217 --> 02:48:19.686]  We now have a growing number of former intelligence officers, including CIA, who are coming out for 9-11 Truth.
[02:48:20.626 --> 02:48:23.689]  Well, we've got Bill Christensen, who is a section chief.
[02:48:24.089 --> 02:48:24.610]  That's right.
[02:48:25.948 --> 02:48:27.749]  I mean, he was the head of Europe, folks.
[02:48:28.189 --> 02:48:38.154]  That's the most important, especially in that time, CIA position as a field chief.
[02:48:38.274 --> 02:48:41.095]  It's just a total inside job.
[02:48:41.115 --> 02:48:43.176]  We'll be right back with two final calls for David Ray Griffin.
[02:48:48.704 --> 02:48:54.168]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.548 --> 02:49:02.173]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.890 --> 02:49:09.955]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.335 --> 02:49:21.762]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.062 --> 02:49:25.765]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.025 --> 02:49:27.966]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.306 --> 02:49:32.149]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:58.610 --> 02:50:02.093]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria
[02:50:02.353 --> 02:50:06.555]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:06.835 --> 02:50:10.776]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:50:10.996 --> 02:50:17.519]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:50:17.739 --> 02:50:23.241]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:23.481 --> 02:50:28.063]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system.
[02:50:28.303 --> 02:50:30.404]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[02:50:35.146 --> 02:50:36.086]  Now yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:45.365 --> 02:50:47.067]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:47.307 --> 02:50:50.990]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:51.331 --> 02:50:53.533]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[02:50:54.053 --> 02:51:00.259]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:51:00.419 --> 02:51:05.324]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:05.524 --> 02:51:14.535]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[02:51:14.875 --> 02:51:20.882]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.
[02:51:21.142 --> 02:51:21.783]  Turn your internet
[02:51:22.083 --> 02:51:24.624]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my
[02:51:53.473 --> 02:51:55.074]  There was something so pleasant.
[02:51:56.394 --> 02:51:58.175]  Even my emotions had an echo.
[02:51:58.656 --> 02:52:03.158]  And it wasn't that I knew too much, folks.
[02:52:06.119 --> 02:52:07.500]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:10.621]  I'm glad that you have joined us.
[02:52:10.681 --> 02:52:12.162]  David, Greg Griffin is our guest.
[02:52:12.662 --> 02:52:14.743]  Final segment, let's gotta jam two more calls in.
[02:52:15.143 --> 02:52:18.885]  Clint in Vegas and one more caller in Iowa.
[02:52:19.165 --> 02:52:20.386]  Go ahead, Clint, you're on the air.
[02:52:21.408 --> 02:52:24.450]  Alex, I just wanted to say I appreciate the work you and David do.
[02:52:25.370 --> 02:52:48.761]  I was watching the interview last night on Webster Tarpley, and it just seems like there's a blackout on the fact that Marvin Bush was very involved in the security at the World Trade Center and the admission that Silverstein made on TV, and it just seemed like it really would have turned the tide on that interview, and I was jumping up and down and, say it, say it, say it, but he never said it.
[02:52:48.841 --> 02:52:50.522]  Is there a blackout about that subject?
[02:52:51.731 --> 02:52:52.631]  I don't think so.
[02:52:52.711 --> 02:53:00.973]  I think just that there are so many things to talk about that in those shows you get very little opportunity to say very much.
[02:53:01.013 --> 02:53:02.813]  Yeah, I mean, we could second-guess Tarpley.
[02:53:02.893 --> 02:53:04.594]  I give him an A+.
[02:53:05.094 --> 02:53:11.835]  Because when they're jumping on you and both interrupting you, I mean... I thought Jones really showed himself for what he really is.
[02:53:11.855 --> 02:53:14.276]  Oh yeah, it was disgusting.
[02:53:14.316 --> 02:53:15.016]  Well, he's scared.
[02:53:15.076 --> 02:53:16.196]  I've talked to Allen privately.
[02:53:17.133 --> 02:53:21.377]  Well, you know, they're not the same in a lot of respects, but on certain vital issues, you won't find the left.
[02:53:38.854 --> 02:53:39.595]  Speaking out.
[02:53:39.615 --> 02:53:42.876]  That's what I meant on warmongering and elitism, yeah.
[02:53:43.196 --> 02:53:56.302]  Yeah, and certainly on 9-11, I deal with a number of journalists in my book, and most of them are from the left, and they've been worse than mainstream journalists on this issue.
[02:53:56.462 --> 02:53:57.182]  Who's up next?
[02:53:57.202 --> 02:53:58.523]  Because I've only got time for one more call.
[02:53:59.743 --> 02:54:01.624]  Kyle in Iowa, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:54:01.644 --> 02:54:03.665]  Hi, how's it going?
[02:54:03.705 --> 02:54:05.026]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:54:06.792 --> 02:54:30.302]  The question I have is, I've been on internet forums arguing back and forth with people about 9-11 truth and the plausibility of the buildings falling due to jet fires and all that, or jet fuel fires and all that, and one of the arguments I haven't been able to rebuttal as effectively as I would like to is, some people are like, well you don't know... Just go ahead and put it out, go ahead and put it out.
[02:54:30.823 --> 02:54:30.983]  Right.
[02:54:32.697 --> 02:54:45.246]  People are like, well, you don't know what else is in the building, what could have been contributing to those fires, and I know personally that the buildings had a certain fire code, but I just don't know how to... Okay, this is how you counter, and we'll get Devin Ray Griffin's comment.
[02:54:45.826 --> 02:54:50.149]  So, yeah, maybe there was, you know, dragons in there.
[02:54:50.910 --> 02:54:52.511]  Maybe there were reptoid aliens.
[02:54:52.551 --> 02:54:57.094]  Maybe the Easter Bunny had big long teeth of carbide steel buzz saws.
[02:54:57.555 --> 02:54:57.775]  Look,
[02:54:59.236 --> 02:55:00.156]  There is code.
[02:55:00.417 --> 02:55:05.420]  There's nothing that could do that except for chemical type explosives and thermite or thermate.
[02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:06.841]  There's nothing that could do that.
[02:55:06.881 --> 02:55:08.382]  A fuel oil tank couldn't do that.
[02:55:08.662 --> 02:55:10.303]  It's never fallen from that before.
[02:55:10.563 --> 02:55:14.726]  We have scientific temperature ratios and we know with seven.
[02:55:14.746 --> 02:55:24.833]  Then on tower one and two, you have the big columns and you have people leaning out right where columns are suddenly severed whose skin isn't burning but giant steel beams are.
[02:55:24.873 --> 02:55:26.014]  David Ray Griffin, last word.
[02:55:26.474 --> 02:55:27.815]  Well, the other thing you can say
[02:55:28.255 --> 02:55:43.006]  Because even if these scenarios were true, that these were towering infernals, and even if they were 1800 degrees Fahrenheit, as hot as they could possibly get, the building still would not have come down.
[02:55:43.086 --> 02:55:46.849]  And particularly building, you know, the South Tower collapses in 56 seconds, 56 minutes.
[02:55:50.857 --> 02:55:52.599]  Look, no modern steel building's ever done it.
[02:55:52.619 --> 02:56:05.532]  I mean, they can always make excuses about how the magic bullet changed directions four times and wasn't damaged and shot through metal and bone and, you know, then flew to Pluto and back and then, you know, resurrected, uh, you know, Timbuktu.
[02:56:05.552 --> 02:56:07.535]  Uh, listen, I appreciate your question.
[02:56:07.575 --> 02:56:08.215]  Good to hear from you.
[02:56:09.344 --> 02:56:11.505]  Professor David Ray Griffin, we love your new book.
[02:56:11.545 --> 02:56:12.906]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:56:13.166 --> 02:56:14.326]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[02:56:15.106 --> 02:56:16.207]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[02:56:16.587 --> 02:56:17.587]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:56:18.248 --> 02:56:20.569]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:20.609 --> 02:56:21.649]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:22.209 --> 02:56:23.250]  God bless you all.

[02:56:30.713 --> 02:56:30.933]  More than
