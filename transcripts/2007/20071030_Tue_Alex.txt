[00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:09.932]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:11.393]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:13.034]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:17.678]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:22.001]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.511]  Yeah.
[00:00:41.044 --> 00:00:50.032]  In the 21st century, the architects of the New World Order are using cheap slave goods and oceans of third world migrants to overrun the United States.
[00:00:50.592 --> 00:01:05.004]  The irony is staggering when you realize that the same oligarchs that have wrecked the third world are now framing the United States for their crimes and using the rightfully enraged mob as a weapon of conquest.
[00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:11.185]  You know, this used to be Mexico, you know what I mean?
[00:01:11.626 --> 00:01:15.209]  And the people that were here before, they're just not gonna get up and leave.
[00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.870]  Hey Kiko!
[00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:16.851]  Hey Kiko!
[00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:17.272]  Hey Kiko!
[00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:18.072]  Hey Kiko!
[00:01:18.092 --> 00:01:19.134]  I need my money!
[00:01:23.268 --> 00:01:27.749]  The globalists are using a divide-and-conquer strategy to balkanize the United States.
[00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.271]  You know, they cause all this exploitation across the globe, and they wonder why people come to America.
[00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:34.111]  You know?
[00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:40.553]  So is your argument that napkins out there are designed to increase illegal immigration?
[00:01:40.673 --> 00:01:41.793]  It's not designed...
[00:01:42.543 --> 00:01:44.624]  Well, you know what?
[00:01:44.644 --> 00:01:45.585]  You might have a point there.
[00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:59.532]  The federal government, tax-free foundations, and the Fortune 500 have pumped more than $800 billion into a long-term strategic plan to export Latin American revolution into the United States.
[00:02:00.572 --> 00:02:07.476]  Legal aliens don't have to have a valid form of identification to set up a bank account or get a car loan, while citizens do.
[00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:13.186]  The government also subsidizes the illegals via welfare, a taxpayer expense.
[00:02:13.626 --> 00:02:21.394]  This is not done to help the illegals, but to subsidize the large corporations that employ them in an ongoing war against the middle class.
[00:02:22.015 --> 00:02:24.737]  Mexican President Vicente Fox is now in Austin.
[00:02:24.838 --> 00:02:31.624]  We are here because we want to strengthen our relationship.
[00:02:34.052 --> 00:02:38.134]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:39.055]  We are live.
[00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:41.256]  It is October 30th, 2007.
[00:02:41.356 --> 00:02:45.318]  We're going to be here for the next three hours live.
[00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:53.682]  At the bottom of this hour, I will air about three or four minutes more of some of the extras from Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:02:54.182 --> 00:03:00.845]  Later today, the extras, 40 minutes of them, will be posted for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:03:00.885 --> 00:03:02.286]  That has not yet been released.
[00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:07.429]  And by the way, your DVDs have been shipped out to you, those of you that ordered in the last few weeks.
[00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.533]  Shipping started yesterday and all orders that come in this week are shipping out this week as well.
[00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:20.115]  Thanks to the great work of my shipping crew here in the InfoWars bunker.
[00:03:22.297 --> 00:03:26.038]  We have got Jim Tucker, who of course is in the Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:03:26.078 --> 00:03:28.079]  He just got his copy of Endgame yesterday.
[00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.160]  I'd forgotten to send him one.
[00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:33.028]  And he sat down last night and watched an hour and a half of it.
[00:03:33.048 --> 00:03:38.753]  He's going to watch the other hour or 50 minutes of it today and talking to him on the phone.
[00:03:38.773 --> 00:03:39.633]  He said it was amazing.
[00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:41.014]  We're going to get his take on that.
[00:03:41.034 --> 00:03:44.757]  The Bilderberg Group and a lot more coming up in the second hour.
[00:03:44.817 --> 00:03:50.942]  Jim Tucker, really the grandfather of exposing the Bilderberg Group, will be joining us for a full hour.
[00:03:51.342 --> 00:03:54.945]  Coming up in the second hour today, he'll also take your phone calls.
[00:03:56.357 --> 00:03:58.898]  In the meantime, terrorists enrolled in U.S.
[00:03:59.058 --> 00:04:00.038]  security corps.
[00:04:00.158 --> 00:04:04.339]  Three active Jihadist in America training classes underway.
[00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.779]  That's from World End Daily, also from World End Daily.
[00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:11.140]  Bush stonewalls on Mexican military aid.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.201]  White House State Department refused to answer WMD questions by Dr. Corsi.
[00:04:18.141 --> 00:04:20.522]  Gotta get him to pop in in the third hour on these issues.
[00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:22.382]  Also,
[00:04:24.938 --> 00:04:29.162]  We are going to get more into what's happening with the dollar and its continual slide.
[00:04:29.363 --> 00:04:32.766]  Record low against British Sterling and other major currencies.
[00:04:33.086 --> 00:04:35.008]  Oil at $93 a barrel.
[00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:45.699]  And I thought I would just break down globalism today very simply for people that have just become listeners and are wondering who we're fighting, who pulls the strings, who we're up against.
[00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:47.245]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:47.285 --> 00:04:49.426]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:50.926]  We're here live every day.
[00:04:51.507 --> 00:04:52.567]  11 to 2 central weekdays.
[00:04:53.027 --> 00:04:54.267]  And Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:54.708]  Central.
[00:04:55.068 --> 00:04:56.408]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.310]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.411]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:10.672]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our government.
[00:05:11.012 --> 00:05:12.793]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:05:13.853 --> 00:05:16.014]  Both their objective being world domination.
[00:05:16.627 --> 00:05:19.069]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:27.174]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.156 --> 00:05:35.119]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:39.061]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:41.983]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:42.023 --> 00:05:43.183]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.203 --> 00:05:43.944]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.964 --> 00:05:45.044]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:46.025]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:47.026]  That's what they're after.
[00:05:47.406 --> 00:05:51.948]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:05:52.148 --> 00:05:55.570]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.591]  Endgame.
[00:05:56.911 --> 00:05:58.552]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:05:58.912 --> 00:06:00.033]  You have been warned.
[00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:08.849]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:12.432]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[00:06:12.852 --> 00:06:15.914]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.

[00:07:01.488 --> 00:07:02.529]  What did I just subtract?
[00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:05.851]  A natural waste factory built within all of our bodies.
[00:07:06.252 --> 00:07:11.235]  Roughly 25 feet of tunnels designed to absorb nutrition and then dispel the waste.
[00:07:11.656 --> 00:07:13.537]  But what happens when the waste gets clogged up?
[00:07:14.264 --> 00:07:21.290]  More than 4 million Americans have frequent constipation, accounting for 2.5 million physician visits a year.
[00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.694]  Now there's AlloCleanse, an all-natural formula based on herbs and safe enzymes.
[00:07:26.995 --> 00:07:32.379]  AlloCleanse gently sweeps the entire digestive tract and supports comfortable regular bathroom habits.
[00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:34.901]  You'll feel lighter and you'll feel clean inside.
[00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:38.865]  And when you remove the waste buildup with AlloCleanse, you'll have more energy.
[00:07:39.145 --> 00:07:40.506]  Energy to use on other things.
[00:07:41.101 --> 00:07:42.742]  Besides worrying about constipation.
[00:07:43.223 --> 00:07:48.067]  For a risk-free trial of Allocleanse, call 1-800-890-3525.

[00:07:54.172 --> 00:07:54.392]  That's 1-800-890-3525.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.804]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:30.800]  All right, thank you for joining us today, friends, all across the world, out here in the United States, and all the ships at sea.
[00:08:33.258 --> 00:08:35.440]  It is Tuesday, the 30th day of October 2007.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.284]  We'll be here for the next two hours, 51 minutes, and a few seconds.
[00:08:43.225 --> 00:08:46.867]  I have a huge stack of important news here in front of me today.
[00:08:46.887 --> 00:08:51.370]  And I thought I would just start with this first.
[00:08:51.751 --> 00:08:54.532]  Not Turkey bombing areas of Iraq.
[00:08:55.453 --> 00:08:57.675]  Not a huge invasion force ready to pour in.
[00:08:59.676 --> 00:09:02.578]  Not the dollar gyrating up and down yesterday, but falling
[00:09:03.672 --> 00:09:09.716]  At the end, all the great Ron Paul news that's coming out.
[00:09:09.756 --> 00:09:12.979]  I mean, he has huge support in San Francisco, the LA Times reports.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:28.970]  There's also a video that was caught, we've got a link to it up on PrisonPlanet.com, where during one of the last debates, Fox News cameramen are there, and there's a Fox News director saying, now don't show Ron Paul, and be sure to not show any of his supporters.
[00:09:32.292 --> 00:09:33.373]  This is how they operate.
[00:09:34.272 --> 00:09:47.942]  Just a great illustration of what's happening behind the scenes, because he's 100% pro-Second Amendment, he's pro-sovereignty, anti-open borders, he is for lower taxes, he's against the Federal Reserve, everything conservatives have always claimed they want.
[00:09:48.282 --> 00:09:54.086]  I mean, look at the Republican Party platform of Texas, he follows it to a T. One of the most conservative in the nation.
[00:09:54.506 --> 00:10:00.010]  But the trolls, the neocons, the followers, most of them paid, and that's come out in the news, could care less.
[00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.131]  All they want is their paycheck.
[00:10:03.473 --> 00:10:10.737]  And so they go around and do the things they did at Digg yesterday, over 1,500 digs, within just 5-6 hours.
[00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:13.579]  It's got to be a record, without it being on the main page.
[00:10:14.199 --> 00:10:15.720]  And they never put it on the main page.
[00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:30.969]  Digg, one of the biggest websites out there, news sites, in censorship news, banned us in January, but because of a big demonstration and protest over it, they quote, unbanned us publicly,
[00:10:32.839 --> 00:10:36.522]  But really have almost completely banned us, but we're not going to stop for all the trolls.
[00:10:37.242 --> 00:10:41.745]  We're illustrating to everybody that it is, that Digg is rigged.
[00:10:41.905 --> 00:10:48.410]  We're going to continue to illustrate with thousands of Diggs, you're the great job listeners, to show how it's rigged.
[00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:56.796]  We're going to continue to then get other people involved with their own sites to post to where there's thousands of sites and you won't be able to block them all.
[00:10:56.816 --> 00:11:00.178]  Of course, most universities, most
[00:11:01.152 --> 00:11:24.899]  Government buildings, most major corporations, Fortune 500, libraries, buy software that, quote, filters out gambling, hacking, porn, and there's one other thing I'm forgetting, gambling, hacking, porn, and, oh, hate, as they're called, and InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com,
[00:11:25.598 --> 00:11:26.818]  They're in those databases.
[00:11:26.858 --> 00:11:30.099]  Jones Report wasn't in it in a while, but it got big, so they put it in there.
[00:11:30.119 --> 00:11:32.580]  I'm sure Truth News will be in there soon, truthnews.us.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:38.322]  That's why it's even more important for you, the listeners, to spread the word about our news websites and what we do.
[00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:39.762]  I mean, we're hurting them.
[00:11:41.643 --> 00:11:54.427]  I mean, we have Larry Pratt on from gunowners.org to expose the mainline history and to put out the public documents where the NRA has been the biggest gun control group since the 1930s.
[00:11:55.922 --> 00:11:56.222]  We're good.
[00:12:07.165 --> 00:12:16.167]  The Gun Control Act, the Brady Bill, the expansion in 2000, the NICS program, and now they're supporting one that will ban millions of veterans and others from owning guns.
[00:12:16.207 --> 00:12:17.548]  That's mainstream news.
[00:12:18.028 --> 00:12:26.170]  Even the armed services and big veteran groups, hundreds of them, it's just... GunOwners.org has a list of the hundreds of groups that have said this is horrible.
[00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.490]  A lot of cops won't be able to have guns anymore.
[00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.191]  They're going to lose their peace officer licenses.
[00:12:30.931 --> 00:12:31.811]  NRA supports this!
[00:12:31.831 --> 00:12:35.272]  Alright, I'm already digressing.
[00:12:36.149 --> 00:12:41.232]  Just go to GunOwners.org and read all those legislative alerts, and join that organization.
[00:12:41.292 --> 00:12:45.334]  Join real gun organizations, Second Amendment groups, and defend it.
[00:12:45.474 --> 00:12:54.579]  It is hanging by a thread right now, and mainline conservatives can't figure that out because they think the NRA is pro-gun.
[00:12:54.599 --> 00:12:55.740]  They're anti-gun.
[00:12:57.421 --> 00:12:58.941]  Not you, the members, the leadership.
[00:12:59.061 --> 00:13:00.322]  It is a fact.
[00:13:00.922 --> 00:13:04.224]  What do you love more, the NRA and your illusions, or the Second Amendment?
[00:13:04.424 --> 00:13:05.585]  I'm going to ask you right now.
[00:13:06.621 --> 00:13:07.621]  Alright, I'm already digressing.
[00:13:09.082 --> 00:13:18.444]  I was on a Pensacola radio station this morning doing an interview, and he was asking what the most important smoking guns of 9-11 are, the fact that it's an inside job.
[00:13:21.144 --> 00:13:36.128]  And I was thinking about them, and I just want to restate for the record before I get into this new news story from WorldLentDaily, that you could try to ignore the Pensacola News Journal, funny it was Pensacola this morning I brought this up, you could ignore Newsweek, you could ignore
[00:13:38.433 --> 00:13:47.203]  The Associated Press and a bunch of other publications that officers at the base of the Pensacola Naval Air Station said, look, we trained the guys that are on TV with those pictures.
[00:13:47.543 --> 00:13:48.144]  Same names.
[00:13:48.684 --> 00:13:53.790]  They were here in a Saudi secret exchange program and that came out in the news.
[00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.352]  At least four of them had been trained there.
[00:13:56.761 --> 00:14:01.203]  Plain view, but again, a population that doesn't know who the Vice President is or where the U.S.
[00:14:01.263 --> 00:14:02.703]  is on a map, on a globe.
[00:14:02.723 --> 00:14:06.184]  I start talking about naval air stations, they don't even know what those are.
[00:14:06.204 --> 00:14:07.825]  They don't even know what Saudis are.
[00:14:07.885 --> 00:14:12.687]  I mean, they just know that handing their guns in and having open borders is good and conservative.
[00:14:16.048 --> 00:14:17.088]  I'm not kidding when I say that.
[00:14:17.108 --> 00:14:18.449]  I mean, these are mindless people.
[00:14:20.313 --> 00:14:27.455]  I have to commend the left, at least a lot of them now hate Hillary and know she's evil and in bed with Bush, and they found out Fox News is funding her and having fundraisers for her.
[00:14:27.896 --> 00:14:32.997]  I mean, the left, at least, they wouldn't listen back under Clinton eight years ago, but they'll listen now!
[00:14:34.258 --> 00:14:40.800]  And a lot of conservatives and libertarians are listening, but a lot of the main sites that are attacking Ron Paul are fake libertarian sites, fake Republican sites.
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.180]  I mean, I've just had it up to here with you!
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.021]  You people are treasonous traitors, and you're liars, and you're scum!
[00:14:48.211 --> 00:14:50.332]  I know most of you are admittedly on White House payroll.
[00:14:50.372 --> 00:14:54.113]  I mean, that's been in the news, but still the general public isn't aware of that.
[00:14:54.153 --> 00:14:55.714]  We need to make people aware of that.
[00:14:59.435 --> 00:15:06.238]  Now, I went over the fact that you have mainstream news admitting that the hijackers were trained at that base.
[00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:13.941]  Then I added that Colonel Butler, the head of the Defense Language School, the dean of the Defense Language School, Fulberg Colonel,
[00:15:15.521 --> 00:15:25.965]  Went public and told the AP and San Jose Mercury News, a few weeks after 9-11, he said the headline was, you know, government behind 9-11, another headline was Bush let 9-11 happen, but that was a spin on what he said.
[00:15:25.985 --> 00:15:29.946]  You read the quotes, it was, we train these guys at our bases.
[00:15:30.087 --> 00:15:32.087]  I saw them personally in my classes.
[00:15:34.108 --> 00:15:37.649]  They started court-martialing him and then he agreed to shut up and they left him alone.
[00:15:37.929 --> 00:15:40.130]  I talked to him on the phone, they were threatening him and everything else.
[00:15:41.131 --> 00:15:41.791]  Wouldn't come on air.
[00:15:43.084 --> 00:15:52.172]  And you could maybe even say that wasn't true, or maybe, you know, you can just watch your Saturday morning cartoons and claim that's the news, or whatever you want to do.
[00:15:52.212 --> 00:15:54.534]  I mean, maybe you can just be a neoconscum and ignore it.
[00:15:54.935 --> 00:15:55.655]  Neoscum.
[00:15:56.276 --> 00:15:56.817]  Neoscum.
[00:15:56.837 --> 00:15:57.697]  Neoconscum.
[00:15:57.978 --> 00:15:58.378]  Followers.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.722]  But then we had the head of the Ottawa U.S.
[00:16:02.782 --> 00:16:08.167]  Embassy, the head of the Riyadh Embassy, two different heads of the embassies, in British, German, and Canadian papers,
[00:16:10.034 --> 00:16:11.295]  With the headlines that U.S.
[00:16:11.435 --> 00:16:13.217]  ordered hijackers back in the U.S.
[00:16:13.617 --> 00:16:15.678]  Ordered embassies to let hijackers back in the U.S.
[00:16:15.819 --> 00:16:17.200]  Similar headlines to that.
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.062]  Toronto Star, BBC, you name it.
[00:16:21.906 --> 00:16:26.288]  I know most of you already know this, but the public still doesn't even know this is the big smoking gun.
[00:16:26.628 --> 00:16:34.051]  They got COINTELPRO ops out there trying to take over the non-law-of-attribute movement and get us focused into space beams and Pluto reptoids and everything.
[00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:38.153]  They used to be kooks, and of course Fox has them on by design.
[00:16:38.173 --> 00:16:41.214]  They're definitely on the payroll to try to discredit us, but that isn't working either.
[00:16:41.915 --> 00:16:44.056]  The people are going to find out about these real issues.
[00:16:49.238 --> 00:16:49.418]  So,
[00:16:51.351 --> 00:16:57.835]  We had two different embassy heads, I interviewed them both here on air, Mr. Springman and the other fellow's name slips my mind, you can go look it up.
[00:16:58.696 --> 00:17:11.824]  One of them before 2001 even ended, and they had gone out to a Malaysian summit, so-called Al-Qaeda summit, in the year before 9-11, and they were coming back into the U.S.
[00:17:12.304 --> 00:17:16.507]  through Saudi Arabia and Canada, and the embassies flagged them in the terror databases as Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:18.416 --> 00:17:19.517]  Of course, they're in the databases.
[00:17:19.537 --> 00:17:21.458]  The CIA created Al-Qaeda in 1979.
[00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:24.480]  That's the name of the computer program file is Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.321]  That's mainstream news.
[00:17:25.561 --> 00:17:26.682]  That term comes from the CIA.
[00:17:26.722 --> 00:17:27.422]  It means base.
[00:17:27.863 --> 00:17:32.846]  Or the base camp from which they were going to build Muslim fundamentalism to be the new threat down the road.
[00:17:33.006 --> 00:17:33.907]  Very sophisticated.
[00:17:34.687 --> 00:17:35.728]  How they run these ops.
[00:17:35.808 --> 00:17:38.170]  Because they knew the Soviet system was going to collapse by design.
[00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.410]  They were going to bring that in.
[00:17:40.551 --> 00:17:41.932]  So they were already building their new threat.
[00:17:42.332 --> 00:17:43.493]  The base is Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:43.793 --> 00:17:45.855]  The base of this Islamofascism.
[00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:55.957]  The Wahhabis out of Saudi Arabia are government funds and controls and protects and is using to attack Iran right now by telling the moronic public that Iran is Al-Qaeda when they're Shiite, the complete opposite group.
[00:17:55.977 --> 00:17:58.979]  It's like sheep versus wolves.
[00:18:01.281 --> 00:18:04.023]  But they're trying to claim now sheep are wolves and wolves are sheep.
[00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:04.963]  It's amazing.
[00:18:06.124 --> 00:18:12.749]  And I talked to Mr. Springman and others and it came up on their computers they were terrorists and they were actually detaining them in Saudi Arabia and Canada when they came in.
[00:18:13.914 --> 00:18:22.482]  The State Department calls and says release him, and then Springman demanded higher-ups above him authorize that, and the Deputy Secretary of State calls and says this is a CIA clearance.
[00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.564]  Those terror designations are CIA covers.
[00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:28.647]  They're part of anti-terror operations.
[00:18:28.667 --> 00:18:29.168]  They're U.S.
[00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:30.129]  government assets.
[00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:31.850]  Let them in.
[00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.111]  That's a direct order.
[00:18:34.272 --> 00:18:38.296]  Then FBI tries to stop them, FBI tries to bust them, and Phoenix and
[00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:39.931]  In Minneapolis, St.
[00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:48.834]  Paul, in Chicago, in Dallas, in Norman, Oklahoma, in San Diego, California, in New York City, in Miami, and every time.
[00:18:49.134 --> 00:18:54.676]  I mean, head anti-terror officers in the FBI over entire districts are told, NO!
[00:18:56.097 --> 00:19:03.159]  Then they get up on the National Press Club and break down crying, saying, here's a letter, I'll be arrested if I tell you what I know.
[00:19:03.179 --> 00:19:06.660]  The FBI agent, Robert Wright,
[00:19:07.802 --> 00:19:11.104]  But all I can tell you is the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[00:19:11.144 --> 00:19:12.085]  That's an exact quote.
[00:19:12.765 --> 00:19:15.307]  The Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:28.336]  And in a way, even getting into how the towers collapsed and bombs and BBC reporting Building 7 had fallen the exact way that it later did fall with the exact official story of why it fell 25 minutes before it fell.
[00:19:31.618 --> 00:19:32.579]  Messing up the scripting.
[00:19:34.511 --> 00:19:37.673]  I mean, all of that is side issues compared to the hijackers, U.S.
[00:19:37.693 --> 00:19:38.314]  government agents.
[00:19:39.094 --> 00:19:43.257]  Regardless of if they really hijacked them, the people we're told that did the hijacking were this.
[00:19:44.658 --> 00:19:47.680]  And then we read an article like this, terrorists enrolled in U.S.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.863]  security corps, three active jihadists in American training classes underway.
[00:19:53.644 --> 00:19:58.648]  So we're going to come back and go over that, and of course, I mean, where do you think these people come from?
[00:20:01.525 --> 00:20:03.806]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[00:20:04.186 --> 00:20:14.171]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[00:20:14.652 --> 00:20:20.194]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[00:20:20.234 --> 00:20:26.918]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July, with falls of $32 billion in the last two weeks alone.
[00:20:27.438 --> 00:20:29.439]  Could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[00:20:30.382 --> 00:20:37.487]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency, and the quality of the dollar is poor, because the quantity is so high.
[00:20:37.867 --> 00:20:43.651]  Printing money out of thin air has disastrous results, victimizing middle-class citizens and discouraging savings.
[00:20:44.211 --> 00:20:48.714]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[00:20:49.115 --> 00:20:51.696]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[00:20:52.157 --> 00:20:53.778]  Call me, Tom Andrew, at 1-800-606-1294.
[00:20:53.858 --> 00:20:54.058]  That's 1-800-606-1294.
[00:21:00.402 --> 00:21:04.664]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:21:05.285 --> 00:21:14.229]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:21:14.669 --> 00:21:21.853]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:21:22.578 --> 00:21:28.082]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:22:01.718 --> 00:22:06.002]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:11.127]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:22:11.347 --> 00:22:12.668]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:22:12.848 --> 00:22:16.211]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:23:03.125 --> 00:23:08.548]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:23:08.988 --> 00:23:13.710]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:23:14.111 --> 00:23:16.732]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:23:17.232 --> 00:23:20.594]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:23:21.391 --> 00:23:25.734]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:23:26.174 --> 00:23:29.356]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:23:29.956 --> 00:23:32.798]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:35.720]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.861]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:23:37.881 --> 00:23:38.221]  U.S.

[00:23:39.942 --> 00:23:40.322]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:23:40.702 --> 00:23:41.162]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:23:41.182 --> 00:23:41.843]  Ask for George.
[00:24:02.062 --> 00:24:07.166]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.887 --> 00:24:10.189]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.172]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:24:30.053 --> 00:24:31.394]  This is World Net Daily today.
[00:24:31.414 --> 00:24:33.775]  Terrorists enrolled in U.S.
[00:24:34.195 --> 00:24:39.137]  security course, three active jihadists in America training class, underway.
[00:24:40.157 --> 00:24:47.520]  At least three active terrorists are taking part in a U.S.-run military training course currently underway in the Middle East, according to the author of a new book.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:53.682]  World Net Daily's Jerusalem Bureau Chief, Aaron Klein, author of the recently released, Schmoozing with Terrorists.
[00:24:54.282 --> 00:24:55.443]  See how they even spin that?
[00:24:56.024 --> 00:24:58.846]  He said yesterday he discovered the terrorists are enrolled at U.S.
[00:24:58.906 --> 00:25:03.668]  Corps in the West Bank city of Jericho that is training 300 members of the Palestinian Authority.
[00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:08.231]  And it goes on to say in August the State Department announced the U.S.
[00:25:08.251 --> 00:25:20.398]  will begin new training courses for FATA militias in an effort to bolster Abbas against Hamas which took over the Gaza Strip in June when the terror group easily defeated American-backed FATA forces in the territory.
[00:25:22.916 --> 00:25:27.158]  And it goes into 86.5 million grant approved by Congress to train them.
[00:25:27.938 --> 00:25:30.339]  And that they're tied into Wahhabist groups.
[00:25:30.499 --> 00:25:34.941]  Okay, let's just stop right there.
[00:25:35.321 --> 00:25:49.607]  The Jerusalem Post, Haratz, and every other major paper I've seen in Israel has reported that in the 1960s, late 1960s, Israel founded Hamas as a, quote, counterbalance to Hezbollah.
[00:25:50.231 --> 00:25:52.072]  So they play different groups off against each other.
[00:25:52.273 --> 00:25:53.994]  Now that's from Israel, that's not me!
[00:25:55.195 --> 00:25:59.678]  See, that's the problem here, I just keep reporting what they're saying.
[00:25:59.718 --> 00:26:16.910]  Then in 2001, 2002, 2003, AP, UPI, Reuters, Jerusalem Post, all of them, a bunch of the news wires and all the big Israeli papers reported, Israel was caught, one security force caught the other security force, creating
[00:26:17.712 --> 00:26:21.634]  I mean, it's so corrupt, it's all these groups even fighting with each other.
[00:26:22.954 --> 00:26:25.735]  Caught, and if you believe that, it means they knew it was already coming out, so they just staged it.
[00:26:26.295 --> 00:26:27.116]  Whatever, we don't know.
[00:26:28.136 --> 00:26:35.119]  That Chinbet caught Mossad, quote, creating fake Al-Qaeda groups, but they weren't fake, they were carrying out bombings.
[00:26:37.199 --> 00:26:41.961]  Again, to keep things radicalized every time there was about to be a peace process, or to keep things stirred up.
[00:26:42.001 --> 00:26:43.882]  Now, for all the neocons and all the
[00:26:46.624 --> 00:26:48.585]  World War III worshippers is what I'd call them.
[00:26:49.006 --> 00:26:57.091]  I mean, don't just sit there driving along in your car right now and just clutch your Pastor Hagee sermon to your heart and say I'm a liar.
[00:26:57.471 --> 00:26:58.432]  Go look that up.
[00:26:59.132 --> 00:27:04.916]  I mean, go look up that Israel in the late 60's staged the Idi Amin.
[00:27:06.658 --> 00:27:08.239]  And the British have reported on that.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.780]  And they put him into power.
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:10.781]  That's mainstream news.
[00:27:11.081 --> 00:27:15.664]  And they staged that whole hostage situation, hostage rescue situation.
[00:27:15.944 --> 00:27:19.847]  But it was real in the fact that they sent in Israeli commandos to die.
[00:27:19.907 --> 00:27:21.408]  I mean, that's how real this stuff is.
[00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:31.614]  And then it's admitted that they have these terror groups, Marxist-Leninist groups,
[00:27:33.348 --> 00:27:54.863]  Three different groups up in the Kurdish-held areas of Iraq that our government's armed and backed, who in one week, a week ago, killed 20-plus military and police across the border, the Turks, and have been killing the police and military that are there with the elected governments in northern Iraq.
[00:27:55.583 --> 00:27:59.806]  And then our media says, oh, how dare you, Turkey, defend yourself?
[00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:02.089]  It just never ends.
[00:28:02.129 --> 00:28:13.091]  And then they have five different Sunni Wahhabist groups, with the admitted number three of real Al Qaeda, under U.S.
[00:28:13.151 --> 00:28:30.355]  funding, being given tens of millions of dollars in weapons, and Bush announced four months ago that they had publicly authorized them to attack Iran, and they've got groups all over Iran killing police, killing civilians, constant bombings and shootings going on, and Iran just sits there and takes it wisely.
[00:28:31.095 --> 00:28:32.176]  They're not jumping at it.
[00:28:33.596 --> 00:28:40.220]  They're just sitting there taking it, just like Syria took getting bombed a few weeks ago and admitted that there was no uranium or plutonium, it was all just made up.
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:54.848]  These are all just provocations or goading that are happening right now, and you have Wahhabists, and that's the sect that was in with Hitler, but before that the British came in and radicalized them,
[00:28:55.783 --> 00:29:10.909]  About 90 years ago, because they didn't want mainline suits and ties Arabs who wanted movie theaters and who wanted music on the radio and who wanted shopping malls.
[00:29:11.309 --> 00:29:18.012]  They were very Western, especially in Iran, which is the Persians, and of course Iraq, and even into Saudi Arabia.
[00:29:18.612 --> 00:29:22.354]  So they came in and armed the Bedouin tribe to just take over and set up the House Assad
[00:29:23.408 --> 00:29:26.989]  Here, have 100,000 hand grenades and 10,000 machine guns.
[00:29:27.009 --> 00:29:28.169]  Now go kill all these people.
[00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:32.150]  And that was public policy then.
[00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.231]  And now they're using them again.
[00:29:34.531 --> 00:29:41.892]  It's like they used the Wahhabis to attack the Serbs, the Serbs fight back, and then they're evil and we gotta go save the wonderful Kosovo people.
[00:29:42.653 --> 00:29:44.853]  I mean, there's no end to how they play this chess game.
[00:29:45.893 --> 00:29:48.634]  And then Bush gets up there and says, Iran is Al-Qaeda.
[00:29:51.582 --> 00:29:52.582]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.982 --> 00:29:54.603]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.503 --> 00:29:58.344]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.724 --> 00:30:02.484]  Job stress.
[00:30:02.645 --> 00:30:03.745]  Painful relationships.
[00:30:03.965 --> 00:30:05.225]  Unbearable money pressures.
[00:30:05.325 --> 00:30:06.885]  Deteriorating health conditions.
[00:30:07.106 --> 00:30:13.407]  Are political uncertainties and a world spinning out of control keeping you from getting the restful sleep your body desperately needs?
[00:30:13.747 --> 00:30:14.207]  It's true.
[00:30:14.447 --> 00:30:18.208]  Researchers now know that insufficient sleep can lead to dangerous health problems.
[00:30:18.268 --> 00:30:18.608]  I think so.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:46.125]  Interact with the human brain in such a way that it almost forces quick, safe, and non-addictive sleep.
[00:30:46.345 --> 00:30:47.366]  It's just that simple.
[00:30:47.486 --> 00:30:53.052]  Created in a special sound lab in Lima, Peru, it seems to generate restful sleep when nothing else will.
[00:30:53.212 --> 00:30:58.758]  So if you're really having trouble falling asleep, go to www.highspeedsleep.com.
[00:30:58.898 --> 00:31:00.180]  That's highspeedsleep.com.
[00:31:01.472 --> 00:31:03.333]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:31:03.473 --> 00:31:08.657]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:31:08.817 --> 00:31:10.158]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:31:10.438 --> 00:31:18.603]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:31:18.823 --> 00:31:24.606]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:31:24.626 --> 00:31:26.488]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:31:26.568 --> 00:31:28.669]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:31:28.849 --> 00:31:33.094]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:31:33.274 --> 00:31:35.417]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:31:35.497 --> 00:31:43.285]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:31:43.746 --> 00:31:44.086]  We're good.
[00:32:00.914 --> 00:32:01.554]  It's a fact.
[00:32:01.774 --> 00:32:09.256]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:32:09.376 --> 00:32:18.238]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:32:18.518 --> 00:32:29.041]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:32:29.321 --> 00:32:35.384]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:32:35.604 --> 00:32:40.606]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:32:40.806 --> 00:32:45.289]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:32:45.449 --> 00:32:47.249]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:32:47.309 --> 00:32:47.570]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.990]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:49.971]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:32:56.974 --> 00:33:12.557]  Look at your young men fighting Look at your women crying Look at your young men dying The way they've always done before
[00:33:22.984 --> 00:33:45.871]  Millions of dollars are being given to Mexico for military aid to pull American citizens out of their cars if they're dumb enough to drive into northern Mexico, to literally be raped on the side of the road, to have all your goods stolen, to have your family be sucked dry of hundreds of thousands of dollars after the Mexican troops run credit checks on your family.
[00:33:45.911 --> 00:33:51.853]  By the way, I know 50, 60, 70, more than that in my lifetime, but this has happened to you in Texas.
[00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.430]  Okay.
[00:33:54.571 --> 00:33:56.693]  I mean, Mexico is one of the most corrupt nations on Earth.
[00:33:56.733 --> 00:33:57.773]  They hate this country.
[00:33:58.094 --> 00:33:59.955]  They lost two wars with America.
[00:34:01.236 --> 00:34:02.417]  They attacked us again.
[00:34:02.437 --> 00:34:04.458]  The Marines had to... They went all the way to Oklahoma.
[00:34:04.978 --> 00:34:06.860]  And the Marines had to go down to Mexico City.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:16.807]  From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we will fight our country's battles.
[00:34:17.007 --> 00:34:18.027]  You know what that's all about?
[00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:21.350]  Spain, Mexico,
[00:34:22.518 --> 00:34:27.503]  Russia, it's really more flags we talk about the Southwest than just six flags.
[00:34:28.083 --> 00:34:39.174]  The British all had claims, but all of the illegal aliens know is they're told in school, financed by our own government, Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation and others, that the US belongs to them.
[00:34:41.209 --> 00:34:48.053]  And then the government's there to give them more welfare than citizens, cheaper tuition than citizens, no IDs, no insurance, nothing needed.
[00:34:48.513 --> 00:34:56.938]  Again, because it's key to the New World Order, it's in the SPP documents for the North American Union, that they have to end any immigration controls.
[00:34:57.438 --> 00:34:58.219]  And I mean, the U.S.
[00:34:58.239 --> 00:34:59.720]  is just going to fill up from worldwide.
[00:35:02.181 --> 00:35:05.983]  Then they can play off the domestic groups against the population and have us submit to it.
[00:35:06.023 --> 00:35:08.745]  So later I'm going to get into bush stonewalls on Mexican military aid,
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.801]  The White House State Department refused to answer WMD questions.
[00:35:14.002 --> 00:35:14.942]  We are in crisis.
[00:35:14.962 --> 00:35:16.003]  They're destroying our dollar.
[00:35:16.023 --> 00:35:16.983]  They're destroying our borders.
[00:35:17.003 --> 00:35:18.023]  They're destroying our sovereignty.
[00:35:18.044 --> 00:35:19.064]  They're destroying the middle class.
[00:35:19.524 --> 00:35:20.805]  It's all happening right now.
[00:35:21.265 --> 00:35:27.807]  Here is just five minutes from the 18-minute extra that is in Endgame, Blueprint from Global Enslavement.
[00:35:27.827 --> 00:35:29.108]  This is just one of the three extras.
[00:35:30.088 --> 00:35:31.369]  It's about 40 minutes of extras.
[00:35:31.949 --> 00:35:34.490]  But Battle for the Republic is really just a section of the film.
[00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:35.231]  The film is too long.
[00:35:35.251 --> 00:35:36.231]  We just made it an extra.
[00:35:36.957 --> 00:35:38.821]  And here's just five minutes from that.
[00:35:39.442 --> 00:35:42.528]  By the way, for PrisonPlanet.tv members, in the next few hours...
[00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:50.614]  We're going to post, and again, it's super high quality, up on PrisonPlanet.tv, the extras from Endgame.
[00:35:51.055 --> 00:36:02.962]  So if you don't have your membership at Endgame, ladies and gentlemen, for Endgame, go to PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, get it right now, or call and get the high quality DVDs, they're shipping right now, 888-253-3139, or order via InfoWars.com.
[00:36:03.102 --> 00:36:04.123]  Here is an excerpt from Endgame.
[00:36:10.922 --> 00:36:19.533]  Now these are excerpts that are put together from, it's not congruent, it's not linear, from the minifilm Battle for the Republic, here it is.
[00:36:22.825 --> 00:36:31.491]  In the 21st century, the architects of the New World Order are using cheap slave goods and oceans of third world migrants to overrun the United States.
[00:36:32.051 --> 00:36:46.601]  The irony is staggering when you realize that the same oligarchs that have wrecked the third world are now framing the United States for their crimes and using the rightfully enraged mob as a weapon of conquest.
[00:36:48.869 --> 00:36:52.632]  You know, this used to be Mexico, you know what I mean?
[00:36:53.073 --> 00:36:56.656]  And the people that were here before, they were just not going to get up and leave.
[00:36:56.776 --> 00:36:57.637]  Hey Chico!
[00:36:57.957 --> 00:36:58.717]  Hey Chico!
[00:36:58.898 --> 00:36:59.858]  Hey Chico!
[00:37:00.179 --> 00:37:00.799]  Hey Chico!
[00:37:04.736 --> 00:37:09.421]  The globalists are using a divide-and-conquer strategy to balkanize the United States.
[00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:14.726]  You know, they cause all this exploitation across the globe, and they wonder why people come to America.
[00:37:15.226 --> 00:37:15.546]  You know?
[00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:22.032]  So is your argument that napkins out there are designed to increase legal immigration?
[00:37:22.133 --> 00:37:26.076]  It's not designed... Well... You know what?
[00:37:26.116 --> 00:37:27.037]  You might have a point there.
[00:37:27.157 --> 00:37:28.819]  The federal government.
[00:37:29.298 --> 00:37:40.983]  Tax-free foundations and the Fortune 500 have pumped more than 800 billion dollars into a long-term strategic plan to export Latin American revolution into the United States.
[00:37:41.943 --> 00:37:48.906]  Illegal aliens don't have to have a valid form of identification to set up a bank account or get a car loan, while citizens do.
[00:37:50.111 --> 00:37:54.634]  The government also subsidizes the illegals via welfare at taxpayer expense.
[00:37:55.074 --> 00:38:02.838]  This is not done to help the illegals, but to subsidize the large corporations that employ them in an ongoing war against the middle class.
[00:38:03.459 --> 00:38:06.180]  Mexican President Vicente Fox is now in Austin.
[00:38:06.301 --> 00:38:13.064]  We are here because we want to strengthen our relationship.
[00:38:14.545 --> 00:38:23.810]  Governor Perry and Fox were forced to cut their conference short after only two minutes because of protesters.
[00:38:38.928 --> 00:38:47.571]  The Guest Worker Amnesty Plan being pushed is nothing more than a North American Union standardized ID card that erases all three nation's sovereignties.
[00:38:48.731 --> 00:38:54.453]  Spanish speaking TV, radio and print is literally on fire with talk of revolution.
[00:38:55.484 --> 00:39:00.128]  With many stations bearing the name La Infusora, or The Invader.
[00:39:00.709 --> 00:39:05.913]  More than 600 billboards were purchased in Los Angeles alone, proclaiming that L.A.
[00:39:05.973 --> 00:39:07.314]  is now part of Mexico.
[00:39:07.975 --> 00:39:10.317]  If you really think about it, it's perfect for the elite.
[00:39:11.058 --> 00:39:18.084]  Americans who don't speak Spanish are unaware of what's going on, so the corporate control revolution can build in semi-secrecy.
[00:39:19.079 --> 00:39:34.046]  Most of the media outlets spewing the slogan, Viva La Raza, which translated means, Long Live the Race, are owned by New York and London-based companies that are cold-bloodedly pushing the break-up of the United States.
[00:39:35.486 --> 00:39:43.290]  Of course, in Mexico, most demonstrations are broken up by the parasitic police force firing machine guns into crowds killing people.
[00:39:43.797 --> 00:39:51.141]  But that didn't stop them from demanding the police physically stop an American citizen from engaging in his own silent protest.
[00:39:53.082 --> 00:40:04.848]  A plainclothes police officer then gave uniformed police the order to arrest the citizen, who had since complied with the officer's directive to suppress his First Amendment rights.
[00:40:05.268 --> 00:40:11.652]  The police did not arrest the protester who assaulted the driver through his sunroof as the crowd cheered.
[00:40:14.924 --> 00:40:24.849]  The man is clearly not resisting, but the Seattle Police are determined to teach him that free speech is only reserved for servants and dukes of the new world.
[00:40:24.869 --> 00:40:27.871]  The elite are rolling out the red carpet to the third world.
[00:40:42.199 --> 00:40:47.951]  Because the United States must be divided before it can be absorbed into the North American Union.
[00:40:48.652 --> 00:40:52.400]  Itself to form the first piece of the Pan American Union.
[00:40:53.306 --> 00:40:58.448]  We have record immigration, illegal immigration in the history of the world!
[00:40:58.928 --> 00:41:01.189]  In the history of the world!
[00:41:01.289 --> 00:41:03.710]  We cannot assimilate this many people!
[00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:09.313]  And the government is teaching them to be Balkanized with their commercial material in Mexico!
[00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:10.153]  To control us!
[00:41:10.173 --> 00:41:11.914]  To divide and conquer!
[00:41:12.194 --> 00:41:14.515]  And it finally destroyed the Roman Empire!
[00:41:14.535 --> 00:41:16.816]  And we're following that same path now!
[00:41:19.077 --> 00:41:21.438]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:29.986]  If you want a crash course, or if you want to have a crash course for anybody in your family, your neighbors, your pastors, it covers it all.
[00:41:30.827 --> 00:41:39.713]  The history of the global elite, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, how they took control of the U.S., the Federal Reserve, the CFR, that's the first 20 minutes.
[00:41:40.174 --> 00:41:42.756]  Then we go to Bilderberg in Ottawa for another 30 minutes.
[00:41:43.617 --> 00:41:47.880]  Then we spend another 20 minutes in the North American Union, another 20 minutes on the Napa Superhighways.
[00:41:49.156 --> 00:41:54.881]  Then we get into the history of eugenics and how they plan to set up a world government and exterminate the majority of the population.
[00:41:54.921 --> 00:41:56.243]  Their own documents, their own statements.
[00:41:56.563 --> 00:41:57.264]  It's irrefutable.
[00:41:57.424 --> 00:42:07.093]  All the admitted testing of chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals, killing tens of thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands admitted declassified worldwide, and it's still going on right now.
[00:42:08.374 --> 00:42:13.859]  And then, of course, we go to Istanbul, Turkey and show you what happened there this year with Bilderberg, and then you have 40 minutes of extras.
[00:42:15.092 --> 00:42:24.242]  18 of which is the mini-film, Battle for the Republic, the best expose, short and sweet, power-packed, to show people, and that's the tip of the iceberg you just heard.
[00:42:24.262 --> 00:42:25.784]  That's 5 minutes of 18 minutes.
[00:42:26.345 --> 00:42:30.570]  I mean, it goes through it all, ladies and gentlemen, and this is stuff that literally no one knows.
[00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:32.072]  The plan of San Diego?
[00:42:33.297 --> 00:42:42.904]  When Mexico, under the control of Germany, attacked the U.S., killed 23 Americans in Texas in one night when they attacked during World War I. I mean, Mexico just keeps attacking us!
[00:42:42.944 --> 00:42:44.285]  They absolutely hate us!
[00:42:44.746 --> 00:42:49.449]  And I will not sit here anymore and play games to be politically correct and not talk about it!
[00:42:51.851 --> 00:43:02.459]  I had some idiot call my Sunday show and go, whoa, you people, he was a white guy of course, you people who are against the open borders, you just don't like Mexicans and this used to be their country anyways.
[00:43:04.295 --> 00:43:04.755]  Oh, is that why 71%?
[00:43:04.996 --> 00:43:08.038]  It could be 67, 71, depending on the poll.
[00:43:09.459 --> 00:43:10.781]  Hispanics don't want open borders?
[00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:11.521]  They're not stupid.
[00:43:13.142 --> 00:43:13.883]  91% of Americans?
[00:43:13.903 --> 00:43:14.864]  I guess we're just all evil?
[00:43:15.204 --> 00:43:18.467]  If you average all the groups and races together in Gallup polls?
[00:43:20.188 --> 00:43:21.249]  And it's only going to get worse!
[00:43:21.569 --> 00:43:21.870]  Okay.
[00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:26.193]  I hope you'll go to InfoWars.com right now and order the DVD.
[00:43:26.373 --> 00:43:27.514]  You just heard part of the extras.
[00:43:27.995 --> 00:43:29.876]  Later this afternoon, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:43:29.936 --> 00:43:30.517]  It's going to be up.
[00:43:32.049 --> 00:43:38.931]  And that trailer that you just heard there for the extras is up right now on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:43:40.051 --> 00:43:43.912]  Alright, I'm only going to spend five minutes on this because I want to get into just the basic globalist plan.
[00:43:43.932 --> 00:43:46.993]  I keep saying I will, but I want to crystallize it and make it very simple.
[00:43:49.073 --> 00:43:51.934]  Because I always instead just go into little sections of it in great detail.
[00:43:52.154 --> 00:43:56.555]  I want to try to just at the 54 after just spend five minutes on before Jim Tucker joins us.
[00:43:56.575 --> 00:44:01.376]  We're going to have open phones later in the third hour today and when Jim's with us in the second hour.
[00:44:04.362 --> 00:44:07.124]  I'm not going to sit here and belabor it.
[00:44:07.904 --> 00:44:11.226]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you the dollars going down.
[00:44:11.246 --> 00:44:11.887]  You already know that.
[00:44:11.907 --> 00:44:15.449]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you that we're in a lot of financial trouble.
[00:44:15.769 --> 00:44:17.150]  I'm totally freaked out and upset.
[00:44:20.872 --> 00:44:25.075]  Silver hasn't moved yet in relation to the dollar being devalued.
[00:44:25.135 --> 00:44:25.755]  It's a great buy.
[00:44:25.775 --> 00:44:26.996]  We've been offering that to you.
[00:44:28.379 --> 00:44:30.681]  I know Ted still has in stock some silver dollars.
[00:44:30.721 --> 00:44:31.922]  I just bought some two weeks ago.
[00:44:31.982 --> 00:44:34.784]  Just got delivery of them Monday.
[00:44:38.287 --> 00:44:41.009]  Gold, Ted has gold at last week's prices.
[00:44:41.129 --> 00:44:42.410]  It's only gone up again.
[00:44:43.791 --> 00:44:48.415]  And I just wanted to, I called Ted this morning and I said come on for a few minutes for our listeners.
[00:44:49.165 --> 00:44:54.649]  Literally, what Ted's selling these to you, I think he makes like $10 a coin, which barely even pays the brokers that take the order.
[00:44:54.669 --> 00:44:58.112]  But he does this to get you introduced to gold, introductory offer.
[00:44:58.992 --> 00:45:04.777]  This is the same deals I get when I get gold from Ted, and you're not going to find it cheaper out there.
[00:45:04.857 --> 00:45:05.818]  And this is introductory.
[00:45:07.399 --> 00:45:11.362]  Frankly, I sometimes think he ought to charge more in these deals just so he can make money to run the network.
[00:45:12.322 --> 00:45:15.505]  But I've said it before, you're insane.
[00:45:16.401 --> 00:45:16.842]  If you don't
[00:45:32.271 --> 00:45:34.054]  One of the specials you've got for folks today.
[00:45:34.295 --> 00:45:38.862]  Well, one of the things I wanted to bring out, we talked about the silver dollars here, what was it, two weeks ago at $3.60?
[00:45:38.902 --> 00:45:40.644]  Actually, it was a week ago.
[00:45:40.985 --> 00:45:43.289]  Silver's up an entire dollar since then.
[00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:47.315]  I guess that was about a week and a half ago I got that, so I guess it wasn't two weeks ago.
[00:45:47.495 --> 00:45:48.977]  Yeah, it was right in that time period.
[00:45:48.997 --> 00:45:54.022]  Anyways, $360 a coin, or per roll, $20 or $18 per coin.
[00:45:54.102 --> 00:45:56.884]  That is the same price as it was back two weeks ago.
[00:45:57.065 --> 00:45:59.287]  Silver's up an entire dollar since then.
[00:46:00.008 --> 00:46:03.051]  I still have the same silver dollars at $360 per roll.
[00:46:03.611 --> 00:46:05.633]  That is such a sleeper, it is crazy.
[00:46:05.693 --> 00:46:07.795]  I mean, that coin is going to go through the roof.
[00:46:07.955 --> 00:46:10.358]  Let's explain this, because I know a lot of people may not understand.
[00:46:11.167 --> 00:46:15.270]  Gold has moved via the devaluation of the dollar.
[00:46:15.531 --> 00:46:17.152]  Oil has corrected.
[00:46:17.432 --> 00:46:21.115]  You know, if the dollar is worth 60 plus percent less, oil is going to go up to $93.00, $100.00.
[00:46:21.415 --> 00:46:22.916]  They're talking about $200.00.
[00:46:23.197 --> 00:46:26.880]  The CFR put out a report saying $200.00 a barrel in the next year.
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.020]  I don't know if that's true.
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.482]  They said a year ago it would be $100.00.
[00:46:29.722 --> 00:46:31.503]  By the end of this year, it looks like they're going to be right.
[00:46:31.823 --> 00:46:32.284]  I don't know.
[00:46:32.684 --> 00:46:35.086]  The point is that oil didn't go up.
[00:46:35.146 --> 00:46:37.308]  The dollar was devalued, okay?
[00:46:38.488 --> 00:46:41.569]  It's still the same it was, pound-wise, in England.
[00:46:42.009 --> 00:46:43.270]  It's the same thing with silver.
[00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:45.271]  Silver has not corrected yet.
[00:46:45.691 --> 00:46:49.432]  Silver is still near the prices it was before the dollar was devalued.
[00:46:49.692 --> 00:46:50.892]  And so that's why it's such a buy.
[00:46:50.952 --> 00:46:51.493]  Go ahead.
[00:46:51.533 --> 00:46:51.893]  Oh, it is.
[00:46:51.953 --> 00:46:53.253]  It's a great bargain at this time.
[00:46:53.273 --> 00:46:54.554]  There's no question about it, Alex.
[00:46:54.614 --> 00:46:56.714]  I mean, the dollar's dropped, what?
[00:46:56.734 --> 00:47:01.036]  Yeah, I mean, I can't afford gold, even the few coins I buy every month now, so I'm going into silver.
[00:47:01.256 --> 00:47:01.996]  Plus, it's the buy.
[00:47:02.396 --> 00:47:04.118]  Yeah, and then you've got gold right now.
[00:47:04.138 --> 00:47:05.139]  Gold is sitting there.
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.302]  It's just touching $800 an ounce.
[00:47:07.722 --> 00:47:12.468]  And I've got to tell you, $840 is the magic number because that's where it was when Jimmy Carter was around back in 1980.
[00:47:12.728 --> 00:47:14.790]  That's when I started in this business.
[00:47:16.619 --> 00:47:17.120]  Absolutely, Ted.
[00:47:44.202 --> 00:47:48.203]  I think the audience is aware of that, but we seem to procrastinate.
[00:47:49.284 --> 00:47:50.364]  I even procrastinate.
[00:47:50.524 --> 00:47:52.104]  Please tell them the silver and the gold you've got.
[00:47:52.124 --> 00:47:53.405]  Okay, let's just go right with that.
[00:47:53.445 --> 00:47:54.905]  Right now I've got the British Sovereigns.
[00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:57.006]  It's still a very fabulous coin.
[00:47:57.046 --> 00:47:58.046]  Quarter ounce gold coin.
[00:47:58.086 --> 00:47:59.267]  It's at $209.
[00:47:59.327 --> 00:48:00.667]  You can't beat that price.
[00:48:01.167 --> 00:48:01.768]  We're good to go!
[00:48:19.583 --> 00:48:20.464]  A week and a half ago.
[00:48:20.544 --> 00:48:24.086]  So now definitely Alex this is the time to get in.
[00:48:24.146 --> 00:48:26.128]  Gold is just going through the rough.
[00:48:26.528 --> 00:48:29.650]  It's going to continue to rise because the dollar is going to continue to fall.
[00:48:29.971 --> 00:48:33.353]  Economically things are tough out there and it's not going to get better.
[00:48:33.933 --> 00:48:41.839]  The dollar is going to fall because there's going to be a forced push for liquidity and eventually we're going to see the Amaro and God knows what's going to happen to us then.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.621]  Anyways I didn't give the 800 number out.
[00:48:44.941 --> 00:48:46.482]  To get in contact with us it's 800
[00:48:48.881 --> 00:48:50.102]  686-2237.
[00:48:50.222 --> 00:48:52.202]  Ask for any one of these three specials.
[00:48:52.623 --> 00:48:56.804]  Definitely the money, the proceeds that come into this go to support the Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:57.224 --> 00:49:01.405]  Hands down, we're going to be there to make sure that this message gets carried forward.
[00:49:01.846 --> 00:49:05.707]  And I would suggest you pick up that endgame because that's going to show you what's going on for sure.
[00:49:06.087 --> 00:49:09.210]  And again, Ted got a lot of this gold and silver weeks and months ago.
[00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:11.131]  That's how he's able to give it to you at these prices.
[00:49:11.211 --> 00:49:17.197]  I personally think the best deal of those three is the British Sovereigns and of course the silver, the Olympics grade as well.
[00:49:17.217 --> 00:49:17.917]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:49:17.937 --> 00:49:18.077]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:49:18.097 --> 00:49:30.448]  You're not going to get that price because it's this week's price unless you tell them it's the Alex Jones special, the special Ted's mentioning.
[00:49:31.209 --> 00:49:32.090]  Give them a call if you want.
[00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:36.197]  Brokers will be there until about 10 o'clock tonight for rebroadcast for people that are listening later.
[00:49:36.217 --> 00:49:36.317]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:49:36.337 --> 00:49:36.397]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:49:42.012 --> 00:49:42.893]  We're good to go.
[00:50:01.062 --> 00:50:07.006]  Or, I can't see it not doubling, so we'd be talking about, what's 2 times 18?
[00:50:07.506 --> 00:50:10.588]  We'd be talking about $36 an ounce silver?
[00:50:10.688 --> 00:50:13.950]  The last time silver peaked out it was $50 per ounce.
[00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:15.551]  Platinum has gone over its peak.
[00:50:15.591 --> 00:50:17.012]  Palladium's gone over its peak.
[00:50:17.052 --> 00:50:18.532]  Now gold is pushing its peak.
[00:50:18.572 --> 00:50:20.794]  There's no reason why silver won't push its peak either.
[00:50:21.034 --> 00:50:21.494]  That's $50 an ounce.
[00:50:23.235 --> 00:50:24.616]  That's what I'm looking for.
[00:50:24.636 --> 00:50:29.738]  Well, again, folks, I've shopped around and this is where I bought my silver a couple rolls last week.
[00:50:30.418 --> 00:50:39.762]  And it's private, it's portable, 1-800-686-2237 or MidasResources.com or GCMLive.com.
[00:50:39.922 --> 00:50:41.903]  If you're missing those numbers, you can link through.
[00:50:41.963 --> 00:50:45.084]  There's also banners on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:45.104 --> 00:50:45.564]  Over to Ted.
[00:50:45.865 --> 00:50:48.546]  Ted, thanks for the economic update and thanks for that great deal.
[00:50:48.726 --> 00:50:49.426]  Yeah, no problem.
[00:50:49.466 --> 00:50:50.086]  I'm glad to be up.
[00:50:50.326 --> 00:50:50.967]  Take care, folks.
[00:50:50.987 --> 00:50:51.487]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.975 --> 00:51:03.357]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.377 --> 00:51:05.478]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.219 --> 00:51:11.003]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:11.123 --> 00:51:13.324]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:13.925 --> 00:51:16.187]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:16.727 --> 00:51:19.129]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:19.901 --> 00:51:27.267]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.249 --> 00:51:35.213]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.713 --> 00:51:39.177]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.557 --> 00:51:42.079]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:42.119 --> 00:51:43.280]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:44.021]  They're not after money.
[00:51:44.061 --> 00:51:45.162]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.322 --> 00:51:46.103]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.343 --> 00:51:47.364]  That's what they're after, you see.
[00:51:47.484 --> 00:51:55.692]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:55.812 --> 00:51:56.693]  Endgame.
[00:51:56.953 --> 00:51:58.815]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:59.015 --> 00:52:00.136]  You have been warned.
[00:52:00.862 --> 00:52:03.883]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:04.203 --> 00:52:09.125]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.385 --> 00:52:13.726]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.027 --> 00:52:22.930]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:26.771]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.051 --> 00:52:32.077]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.377 --> 00:52:39.124]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.605 --> 00:52:40.146]  What about you?
[00:52:40.885 --> 00:52:46.252]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:51.670 --> 00:54:00.159]  That's 877-817-9829 and get your Sony GT-160S AM FM shortwave radio and CD player from the Power Hour.
[00:54:01.521 --> 00:54:07.428]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:24.474 --> 00:54:26.095]  Basically, what is the New World Order?
[00:54:27.076 --> 00:54:36.401]  Throughout history, there have been ruthless elites that want to dominate and set up empires and set up dictatorships so they can rob even the middle class and the elites beneath them, the wealthy.
[00:54:38.644 --> 00:54:50.348]  And we have a society today about short-term profits for the general public and even the Fortune 500, but the big banks above them control the entire political spectrum and the economic spectrum because they control the issuance of currency.
[00:54:52.469 --> 00:54:59.452]  The few rogue nations you hear about are nations that don't have those private central banks issuing and controlling the issuance of their currency and credit.
[00:55:01.693 --> 00:55:07.435]  And you just have a country of people who don't know basic geography, don't know the basic
[00:55:08.462 --> 00:55:33.336]  system of government or jurisprudence and they're like lambs to the slaughter with a highly organized global fortune 100 backed up by the big central banks and the military-industrial complex and big pharma all owned by the same individuals coming in wanting to set up a North American Union, an Asian Union, a European Union right now Sarkozy's proposing a Caribbean Union not a Caribbean, a Mediterranean Union
[00:55:35.675 --> 00:55:38.538]  Because when they set up a new system, they get to abolish the old.
[00:55:38.758 --> 00:55:40.320]  That's another larger key.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:48.347]  They remove the control you have in your own nation, your own sovereignty, but they also get to write the rules and set up the new systems.
[00:55:49.409 --> 00:55:57.957]  And each treaty might be 14,000 pages long in some cases, all intricately written where these big corporations can do whatever they want, but medium and small can't.
[00:55:58.746 --> 00:56:01.087]  It's all about monopolies, rigging the game.
[00:56:01.167 --> 00:56:10.092]  It's like a casino with 90 to 10 odds, where you've got a 10% chance of winning.
[00:56:10.412 --> 00:56:12.833]  Most casinos are 55, 45, 60, 40.
[00:56:13.994 --> 00:56:15.575]  This is a totally rigged system.
[00:56:17.136 --> 00:56:21.898]  And there was so much wealth and so much free market and so much manufacturing capacity, there's still a lot of wealth.
[00:56:23.219 --> 00:56:27.041]  But the point is, they're coming in with the global carbon tax, there's a tax on humans,
[00:56:27.961 --> 00:56:29.042]  It's all Malthusian.
[00:56:29.082 --> 00:56:30.382]  It's about controlling our lives.
[00:56:30.402 --> 00:56:32.624]  They're engaged in eugenics operations against us.
[00:56:33.804 --> 00:56:35.325]  They literally just hate our guts.
[00:56:35.365 --> 00:56:41.369]  And then you have an intelligentsia who are making millions of bucks a year who kind of man this whole system.
[00:56:41.409 --> 00:56:44.711]  And they're all working as specialists in their own little sub-area.
[00:56:44.731 --> 00:56:48.713]  I mean, I talk to people who are very wealthy, very successful middle-class people.
[00:56:50.302 --> 00:57:07.135]  I consider real middle class worth tens of millions, and they're experts in their little field, nanotech, bioengineering, writing, music, film, finance, whatever it is, but you ask them about, what's the subcontinent?
[00:57:07.175 --> 00:57:08.136]  They won't even know it's India.
[00:57:09.057 --> 00:57:12.719]  Or, what's the tallest peak in the Himalayan range?
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:14.141]  They don't even know it's Everest.
[00:57:14.181 --> 00:57:17.183]  And I've done this with people at parties and things, the few I go to.
[00:57:18.084 --> 00:57:22.267]  And it's because it's not that they're dumb or stupid, it's that they are specialists.
[00:57:22.387 --> 00:57:29.232]  And they go try to make as much money as they can on their specialty, and then they go back to their mansions at night and they just feel good and hang out and do whatever.
[00:57:29.612 --> 00:57:32.994]  Meanwhile, they're not even conscious that their dollar's been devalued.
[00:57:33.014 --> 00:57:36.357]  They're just now starting to wake up to that, and that's why the slide's accelerating.
[00:57:37.277 --> 00:57:42.641]  And they feel like, because they're worth, you know, ten million dollars or whatever, that they're members of the elite.
[00:57:42.761 --> 00:57:43.362]  And you're not.
[00:57:45.463 --> 00:57:46.564]  You're not members of the elite.
[00:57:47.885 --> 00:57:53.766]  And you need to understand, you're still within the controlled sub-basement of the economic world system.
[00:57:53.806 --> 00:57:56.407]  You're playing with... It's kind of like playing Monopoly.
[00:57:57.327 --> 00:57:58.427]  The bank always wins.
[00:57:58.767 --> 00:58:00.708]  The bank's got truckloads of the funny money.
[00:58:01.428 --> 00:58:03.729]  And you're sitting there going, look, I've got the boardwalk.
[00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:05.689]  Look, I've got hotels.
[00:58:05.729 --> 00:58:06.929]  Look, I'm winning the game.
[00:58:08.049 --> 00:58:10.410]  But you've still got little pieces they created, they made.
[00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:12.010]  You've still got little funny money.
[00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:14.891]  And you're literally just playing a controlled game they run.
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:19.142]  And the globalists are openly saying they don't like you having money and power.
[00:58:19.462 --> 00:58:23.806]  They only... See, they didn't fully control the economic system before.
[00:58:23.886 --> 00:58:27.228]  Now they're getting to the point where they control 80 plus percent of it.
[00:58:28.249 --> 00:58:32.813]  And so they don't need you and the 20 percent out there who think you're the elite.
[00:58:32.853 --> 00:58:36.315]  They want to get your money and power away from you.
[00:58:36.916 --> 00:58:39.538]  But you think you're members of the elite, so you're blind as bats to it.

[00:58:57.401 --> 00:58:58.062]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.702 --> 00:58:59.803]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.484 --> 00:59:01.585]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.246 --> 00:59:03.067]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.807 --> 00:59:04.728]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.389 --> 00:59:09.032]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.573 --> 00:59:13.617]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.198 --> 00:59:21.382]  We're now into the second hour of this October 30th, 2007 edition.
[00:59:21.402 --> 00:59:24.044]  The big news, Endgame is released, is shipping.
[00:59:24.064 --> 00:59:39.515]  If you haven't gotten your DVD of this historical film that gives you the master plan A to Z, from the North American Union to the EU to Eugenics to the La Reconquista, the Conquest of Auslan, it's all covered in the new film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:59:39.555 --> 00:59:43.318]  Watch it right now and download it at superhighqualityofprisonplanning.tv.
[00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:49.674]  Speaking of in-game, we haven't had Jim Tucker on since he got back three or four months ago.
[00:59:49.694 --> 00:59:56.019]  I guess it was June, five or six months ago, from the Vilderberg Group in Turkey.
[00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:58.181]  I want to debrief him now in hindsight.
[00:59:58.241 --> 01:00:02.344]  I know he was exhausted when he was over there because it was like nine hours different and he hadn't had any sleep.
[01:00:03.385 --> 01:00:07.809]  I've watched all the raw footage shot over there with him, the film crew we had out there shooting stuff for us.
[01:00:08.784 --> 01:00:17.632]  And he was exhausted, but now he'll be back and he's a big part of Endgame and I just want to get his take on a lot of geopolitical issues and take calls.
[01:00:18.913 --> 01:00:19.693]  So that is coming up.
[01:00:19.713 --> 01:00:26.439]  You want to talk to Tucker or talk about the Bilderberg Group or talk about the Endgame, which is a whole host of issues, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.982]  Now don't screen your calls.
[01:00:30.002 --> 01:00:33.165]  If you want to tell us your first name or where you're calling from, that's fine.
[01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:36.768]  It's gotten a little plug-heavy where the same people are trying to call in every day.
[01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:43.217]  And just plug, and that's real boring, just out of the gate, so let me plug something, thank you very much, goodbye.
[01:00:44.358 --> 01:00:54.465]  So I just have a little respect for our guest and the issues we're covering, because I'll let you call in about whatever you want, but if it just, if it just turns into half the callers being, just plugging, that is the death of a radio show.
[01:00:55.426 --> 01:01:04.672]  And I just, it's all about the information, it's about what's happening economically, spiritually, psychologically.
[01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:08.963]  To this nation, to the world, and what the globalists are up to and what they're doing.
[01:01:08.983 --> 01:01:10.383]  I'd love to hear from first-time callers.
[01:01:10.443 --> 01:01:11.804]  I'll just institute this again.
[01:01:12.304 --> 01:01:15.365]  First-time callers are put to the very front of the line at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:15.385 --> 01:01:20.486]  Because I get a lot of complaints that people can't ever get through, and I do take calls.
[01:01:20.506 --> 01:01:21.366]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:24.007]  And it'd be nice if you had a question about the Treaty of the Sea.
[01:01:28.965 --> 01:01:29.926]  The Law of the Sea Treaty.
[01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:32.908]  It'd be nice if you had a question about the formation of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:01:32.928 --> 01:01:36.091]  Or if you had a question about open borders and how that ties in.
[01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:38.092]  Or if you had a comment for Jim Tucker.
[01:01:38.232 --> 01:01:42.936]  I mean, there's such a wide area when we say New World Order and what they're doing.
[01:01:42.996 --> 01:01:44.577]  It's basically anything you want to talk about.
[01:01:45.878 --> 01:01:57.487]  But sometimes I've got a guest on and the callers want to chastise me on some other issue or tell me how I need to do my job better or what I need to do or how I need to do this or that.
[01:01:57.507 --> 01:01:58.768]  I just really don't have time for it.
[01:01:59.691 --> 01:02:14.158]  Or how we are changing to shoot better video, or we need to... I mean, again, the minority of you do it, but frankly, I just can't suffer it, because I'm just... I'm getting old and crotchety or something.
[01:02:14.258 --> 01:02:17.380]  I just do this too much to play games anymore.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.521]  This is too life and death.
[01:02:19.181 --> 01:02:20.181]  This is too serious.
[01:02:21.222 --> 01:02:25.244]  And this broadcast every day is the Super Bowl or the fight against the New World Order.
[01:02:27.624 --> 01:02:31.848]  I have a great responsibility, and that doesn't mean I live up to it every day either, or even every hour.
[01:02:32.208 --> 01:02:49.084]  I'm trying here to do the best radio broadcast I can, to be as accurate as I can for you, to really not mince words, not pull punches, to go all the way, to really say what I think, and may the chips fall where they may.
[01:02:52.037 --> 01:02:54.059]  So when we get back, we'll be talking to Jim Tucker.
[01:02:54.099 --> 01:02:55.580]  There's a lot of other financial news.
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:03:01.505]  There's a lot of other world news, military news, Turkey news, with the situation over there in Iraq.
[01:03:02.065 --> 01:03:04.247]  It's going to be coming up today as well.
[01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:07.269]  Ron Paul being openly censored by Fox News.
[01:03:07.329 --> 01:03:09.952]  Fox caught on tape saying censor Ron Paul.
[01:03:11.893 --> 01:03:16.277]  Also, a human rights expert says close Gitmo.
[01:03:16.597 --> 01:03:17.698]  That's like Satan.
[01:03:19.981 --> 01:03:22.185]  Saying, close the third circle of hell.
[01:03:22.405 --> 01:03:26.191]  Or, or, or, or... That's like Satan saying, stop Satan worship.
[01:03:28.034 --> 01:03:29.356]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[01:03:30.726 --> 01:03:32.547]  Or it's like Satan reporting on Lucifer.
[01:03:32.827 --> 01:03:33.627]  It's one and the same.
[01:03:33.647 --> 01:03:40.509]  It's all part of that jockeying as they create false choices and then kind of like a house of mirrors for everyone.
[01:03:41.209 --> 01:03:43.269]  Big story up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:03:43.389 --> 01:03:45.590]  Actor Ruffalo baffled at collapse of Twin Towers.
[01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:49.871]  That's a big story as well on the heels of the big Martin Sheen story yesterday.
[01:03:53.532 --> 01:03:54.932]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:56.013 --> 01:03:57.013]  A new world order.
[01:03:57.762 --> 01:04:02.785]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:04:02.825 --> 01:04:05.447]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.708]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:04:08.268 --> 01:04:10.710]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:18.775]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:21.784 --> 01:04:26.787]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:27.267 --> 01:04:30.729]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:33.630]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:34.831]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:34.851 --> 01:04:35.611]  They're not after money.
[01:04:35.631 --> 01:04:36.692]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:36.892 --> 01:04:37.652]  They're after power.
[01:04:37.852 --> 01:04:39.013]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:07:19.594 --> 01:07:22.176]  We are now eight minutes into this second hour.
[01:07:22.196 --> 01:07:25.418]  For the rest of the hour, we're going to have Jim Tucker from American Free Press.
[01:07:26.058 --> 01:07:30.761]  And he is there in his office, as he describes it, like a beehive of folks.
[01:07:30.801 --> 01:07:34.123]  He just got in game yesterday and was watching it at the office.
[01:07:34.143 --> 01:07:39.587]  I mean, he has a DVD player at home, and so he got to watch about half of it and did like it, but I wanted to put that in his own words.
[01:07:39.987 --> 01:07:42.729]  But he did tell me that the American Free Press folks were blown away by it.
[01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:52.480]  He's not here really to talk about in-game today, though he's one of the big contributors to in-game, along with Daniel Iselin, Dr. Michael Kaufman, and others.
[01:07:53.001 --> 01:07:59.689]  He's here, in hindsight, months after, well, five, six months after the Bilderberg Group meeting, about five months after
[01:08:01.201 --> 01:08:09.786]  To in retrospect recap what he witnessed there, what he saw in Istanbul with the global elite, what fragments of info they got out from their moles of what was on the agenda.
[01:08:10.206 --> 01:08:13.908]  I remember what he said was on the agenda, that Bush would soon announce that he was for Kyoto.
[01:08:14.328 --> 01:08:16.850]  He announced that within one week of Jim saying that here on air.
[01:08:17.530 --> 01:08:18.251]  Hadn't been in the news.
[01:08:18.991 --> 01:08:27.176]  He announced that Turkey had lied and said that they weren't going to go into northern Iraq, but I guess so they lied there, but he said that that was coming soon.
[01:08:27.256 --> 01:08:29.317]  No one had heard about any rumblings of that at that time.
[01:08:30.257 --> 01:08:30.538]  I don't know.
[01:08:47.188 --> 01:09:04.893]  During this mass culling and shearing that's happening, so much of what Jim talked about has come true, so I wanted to vet any other little segments or areas that he didn't get to cover from his reports from high atop his hotel late, late in the evening when he would join us here during the day in the States.
[01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:09.274]  So, Jim Tucker, the grandfather of exposing Bilderberg Group,
[01:09:10.184 --> 01:09:14.467]  He would say the great-grandfather would be Westbrook Pegler, who is immortalized in Endgame.
[01:09:14.848 --> 01:09:16.429]  But, Jim, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:09:16.889 --> 01:09:17.530]  It's always fun.
[01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:35.823]  Jim, let's recap, basically, running down the gamut of what happened in Turkey, what the importance was, some of the attendees, and then what you got out of there, what their agenda was, any splits, and how what you heard was going to happen five months ago, how that meshes with what has happened.
[01:09:36.683 --> 01:09:38.345]  Well, I'm holding my little fist left.
[01:09:39.568 --> 01:09:40.229]  We're good to go.
[01:10:06.694 --> 01:10:12.318]  Clinton was all for it, but he failed to try to submit it to Congress when he failed on a testament of about 90 to nothing.
[01:10:12.338 --> 01:10:25.306]  President Ronald Reagan opposed it strongly, refused to submit it to Congress, said it reduces America's national sovereignty.
[01:10:27.048 --> 01:10:40.638]  But we did report out at Bilderberg that President Bush would have made the promise, then pressured Bilderberg with all those officials, the official Washington attending, to support the Law of the Sea Treaty, and he would.
[01:10:41.039 --> 01:10:45.022]  We also pointed out that it would not be in anybody else's newspaper for months.
[01:10:45.702 --> 01:10:47.564]  And to this day, it's not been in the Washington Post.
[01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:52.948]  You can imagine, well, the Washington Post, as you know, is Representative Bilderberg's.
[01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:53.928]  Bilderberg controlled.
[01:10:54.689 --> 01:10:55.770]  So a big issue like that.
[01:10:56.562 --> 01:10:58.303]  And it looks like we're winning.
[01:10:58.884 --> 01:11:02.966]  I'm not being over-optimistic, but the Republican leadership is all opposed to it.
[01:11:03.307 --> 01:11:14.514]  They're saying that the Senate cannot get enough votes to sustain the policy treaty as a treaty.
[01:11:15.055 --> 01:11:15.635]  It takes two-thirds.
[01:11:17.934 --> 01:11:22.920]  Most of the Republican candidates have been forcing their dialogue, too.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.202]  Most strongly, of course, is Ron Paul.
[01:11:25.663 --> 01:11:31.569]  But all the others, except, I think, Juliana, are on record as opposing the Law of the Sea Treaty.
[01:11:32.378 --> 01:11:32.778]  We're good to go.
[01:11:54.507 --> 01:12:22.986]  Well I noticed they've sent out droves of fake conservative neocons to do the talk radio circuit claiming it's anti-UN legislation and will secure our waterways when in truth it clearly says the UN will control all the major salt water up to about 10 miles out and then we'll control the regulations that those countries have over their own waterways and we'll put a global tax and global UN fleets that are funded by it out there literally engaging in letter of mark harassment
[01:12:24.187 --> 01:12:26.290]  Well, actually, it goes beyond the waterways owned to dry land.
[01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:27.371]  That is some... Buffer zones, yes.
[01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:51.737]  Jackass from some tin hat country could complain that something we're doing offshore is polluting the waters, or doing something terrible to the waters.
[01:12:51.817 --> 01:13:01.542]  And it puts that power into the UN treaty, and already with Russia, the UN is going to decide next year who gets the North Pole.
[01:13:01.642 --> 01:13:06.225]  I mean, again, the UN in control, global government, and this is just another attempt to grab even more power.
[01:13:07.098 --> 01:13:08.560]  Absolutely, it would be.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.800]  Three different U.N.
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:15.785]  tribunals would have some degree of jurisdiction.
[01:13:15.985 --> 01:13:18.007]  Well, we already have tribunals over our trade.
[01:13:18.027 --> 01:13:28.355]  And, of course, President Bush, going along with this nonsense of having the International Criminal Court tell
[01:13:29.248 --> 01:13:40.079]  The United States, those 40 Mexican murderers on death row throughout the country should have new trials because we didn't volunteer to them that you can call your consulate.
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.361]  I mean, we have no obligations.
[01:13:42.542 --> 01:13:45.985]  And they're appealing to the United Nations and Bush is saying, oh yes, the U.N.
[01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:46.706]  has the authority.
[01:13:46.786 --> 01:13:52.832]  And from his own state, he's saying that a criminal, a killer,
[01:13:53.743 --> 01:14:02.806]  Illegally on death row in his own state should have a new trial because he was not told that he could get help from his employees.
[01:14:05.346 --> 01:14:11.848]  Well, I see nothing in the law that says criminals have to be given free counseling.
[01:14:11.868 --> 01:14:15.989]  It's his job to know that he can get such counseling, not our job to tell him.
[01:14:16.529 --> 01:14:22.491]  But part of the merits of the case, certainly you in court should not
[01:14:23.478 --> 01:14:26.961]  Well, plus they're illegally here to begin with.
[01:14:27.021 --> 01:14:29.082]  Yes, they're criminals from across the border.
[01:14:29.102 --> 01:14:32.345]  It's misdemeanor, which should be made a felony.
[01:14:33.346 --> 01:14:36.088]  And after they come across the border, they murder people.
[01:14:36.748 --> 01:14:43.793]  And certainly, we should never yield any jurisdiction to a foreign court.
[01:14:43.973 --> 01:14:50.318]  The Supreme Court should be the highest court any American can go to, or would vote to go to.
[01:14:51.397 --> 01:14:56.678]  Jim, Law of the City, very, very important, and they keep trying to ram it through, but as you said, for now, it's in deep trouble, thank God.
[01:14:57.398 --> 01:15:04.160]  But expanding out on what else was on the agenda at Bilderberg this year.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.780]  I have to reach back a long ways now.
[01:15:10.241 --> 01:15:13.402]  Well, you talked about how, again, Bush was going to try to sign on to Kyoto.
[01:15:13.782 --> 01:15:15.642]  Now we're seeing a raft of initiatives
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.762]  And it's in the SDP documents to get carbon tax here in the U.S.
[01:15:20.762 --> 01:15:23.524]  Yes, and of course the obvious efforts.
[01:15:25.985 --> 01:15:36.871]  Bush has long been committed to the long-time Billiberg program of converting the Western Hemisphere into the American Union.
[01:15:37.872 --> 01:15:40.173]  They had hoped to accomplish that by the year 2000.
[01:15:40.213 --> 01:15:44.695]  It goes back to the late 80s or early 90s when they first started promoting it.
[01:15:45.236 --> 01:15:45.616]  That's when
[01:15:46.662 --> 01:15:48.863]  This is Kenneth Clark, Member of Parliament from Britain.
[01:15:49.503 --> 01:15:55.985]  I said so directly in an eyeball-to-eyeball interview on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations.
[01:15:56.825 --> 01:16:01.206]  And they definitely thought it would be accomplished by the year 2000.
[01:16:01.246 --> 01:16:02.706]  Now it's seven years later.
[01:16:05.624 --> 01:16:07.605]  And they're in deep trouble.
[01:16:07.625 --> 01:16:08.465]  We're winning some of those.
[01:16:08.525 --> 01:16:09.266]  I mean, we're winning.
[01:16:09.766 --> 01:16:16.209]  When Americans wake up like they do in the Lost Treaty, when Americans become educated and informed, they express outrage.
[01:16:16.869 --> 01:16:21.532]  And that's exactly why it's in trouble in the Senate now and probably will not be ratified this year.
[01:16:28.536 --> 01:16:33.859]  The backup position, the North American pre-trade area, Mexico, United States, Canada.
[01:16:34.099 --> 01:16:49.766]  Well, for citizens out there listening with the mainstream media saying NAU doesn't exist, SPP doesn't exist, we've been to the meetings, we have the documents, we've had the congressman on, we've gone over it, this is all real, and the fact that they're denying it to the public shows just how that much more nefarious
[01:16:50.555 --> 01:16:51.335]  Yes, because the
[01:17:10.262 --> 01:17:18.588]  You can believe that these senators were astounded to get calls from their constituents, and astounded they even knew there was such a thing as the Lost Trees.
[01:17:19.028 --> 01:17:21.049]  Nothing in the newspapers, nothing on the networks.
[01:17:22.650 --> 01:17:34.499]  The Washington Times has had a good bit on it, but the Washington Times has never been invited to a Bilderberg meeting, they're known as a strong nationalist newspaper, and they have
[01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:56.105]  The Washington Post, New York Times, the network's radio silence lost, and virtually on the North American Union, too, as they were silent on the original efforts to extend NAFTA throughout the Western Hemisphere and let it evolve into the American Union.
[01:17:56.125 --> 01:18:01.669]  And they thought that would happen, and as I said, seven years ago, they thought that would happen.
[01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:05.271]  It's good news that their whole program is in trouble.
[01:18:05.291 --> 01:18:11.435]  Do you see signs that David Rockefeller and others in the twilight of their lives are upset that their great dream is in trouble?
[01:18:13.556 --> 01:18:17.178]  Rockefeller used to have more of a gleam in his face than he has in recent days.
[01:18:17.258 --> 01:18:28.245]  It could be partly because he's 90-some years old and frail and all that, but he's got to be depressed over not living to see his dream come true in his lifetime.
[01:18:31.025 --> 01:18:32.787]  I'd say he's deep into his nineties.
[01:18:33.268 --> 01:18:34.649]  Little brothers are all dead.
[01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:40.636]  Yeah, I think they're quite depressed over it.
[01:18:40.656 --> 01:18:44.881]  And Henry Kissinger does have an ounce in his low hunkers than he used to have.
[01:18:46.002 --> 01:18:49.506]  Jim Tucker, veteran investigative news journalist and author.
[01:18:50.127 --> 01:18:50.727]  Will be with us.
[01:18:50.807 --> 01:18:51.308]  Stay with us.

[01:19:29.506 --> 01:19:33.447]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[01:19:33.667 --> 01:19:40.269]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[01:20:59.549 --> 01:20:59.809]  Hemp.
[01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:02.971]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[01:21:03.331 --> 01:21:03.611]  Hemp.
[01:21:03.951 --> 01:21:10.434]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[01:21:10.774 --> 01:21:14.015]  Our Founding Fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.

[01:21:53.318 --> 01:21:55.159]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:21:55.299 --> 01:22:00.462]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:22:00.642 --> 01:22:01.983]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:22:02.263 --> 01:22:10.447]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:22:10.647 --> 01:22:16.370]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:18.312]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:20.554]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:22:20.694 --> 01:22:24.958]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:22:25.118 --> 01:22:27.260]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:35.207]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:22:35.287 --> 01:22:35.667]  We're good.
[01:23:04.708 --> 01:23:09.289]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[01:23:10.730 --> 01:23:13.131]  I won't even turn my head.
[01:23:15.611 --> 01:23:21.613]  Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talking.
[01:23:21.653 --> 01:23:23.414]  I'll be gone like I said.
[01:23:26.054 --> 01:23:30.958]  You'd say the same old thing that you've been saying all along.
[01:23:30.998 --> 01:23:35.342]  Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[01:23:35.722 --> 01:23:41.227]  Don't give me that old familiar cryin' cussin' moan.
[01:23:42.088 --> 01:23:44.390]  Understand your man.
[01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:46.452]  I'm tired of your bad mouthin'.
[01:23:47.232 --> 01:23:48.273]  Understand your man.
[01:23:52.085 --> 01:23:54.327]  Allison, Mark, Mike, James, Randy.
[01:23:54.847 --> 01:23:58.789]  We're going to your calls right after this short segment and the long segment coming up.
[01:23:58.809 --> 01:23:59.449]  So stay there.
[01:23:59.469 --> 01:24:00.250]  We want to hear from you.
[01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:01.951]  I want to talk to Jim Tucker.
[01:24:02.071 --> 01:24:03.351]  Pick his brain.
[01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:05.092]  30 plus years covering Golda Berga.
[01:24:05.112 --> 01:24:08.594]  He's been to almost 30 conferences in Istanbul, Turkey this year.
[01:24:09.215 --> 01:24:15.278]  You know, all that aside, and I want to talk about the Turkey-slash-Kurd situation in northern Iraq with you, because you were bringing that up.
[01:24:17.159 --> 01:24:17.600]  I don't know.
[01:24:29.642 --> 01:24:31.564]  I mean, I'd be tired at my age.
[01:24:31.584 --> 01:24:33.345]  You're running around all over being followed.
[01:24:33.385 --> 01:24:34.426]  We have all the video now.
[01:24:34.466 --> 01:24:35.908]  You talked at the time about being followed.
[01:24:36.388 --> 01:24:41.673]  We got video of guys covering their mouths while they talk, looking at you, police out front your hotel.
[01:24:42.033 --> 01:24:49.059]  We've got them following you and it looks like a spy movie with the with the bazaars and the shops like Indiana Jones or something.
[01:24:49.099 --> 01:24:51.962]  I mean, but this is real and by the way, it's an endgame.
[01:24:52.782 --> 01:24:54.483]  So a lot of fun to tease the turkey skulls.
[01:24:54.503 --> 01:24:55.203]  They're supposed to be
[01:25:19.493 --> 01:25:24.357]  Uh, very straight faced and sometimes you can make them giggle a little bit.
[01:25:24.417 --> 01:25:27.559]  I'll say to one guy, okay, I'm going to walk down here for a while.
[01:25:27.579 --> 01:25:28.500]  Do you want to come with me?
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.941]  I'll be right back if you're tired.
[01:25:31.442 --> 01:25:31.983]  But you're right.
[01:25:32.003 --> 01:25:35.005]  It was a type of help we're getting.
[01:25:35.045 --> 01:25:42.831]  I believe it's because the internet in the last several years, uh, come from people I believe to be
[01:25:44.333 --> 01:25:50.874]  Well, maybe I'm being chaste, but people who are aware through the internet of Bilderberg.
[01:25:51.234 --> 01:26:12.258]  Now, I'd get a call saying, uh, meet you at such and such, uh, bar, and the, uh, I found the bar, there's a big glass wall to the street, and the guy at the bar, and people at the tables could be observed, and the drill would be for me to sit down at the bar,
[01:26:15.733 --> 01:26:23.501]  This guy would look up and down the street, determined that nobody he knows sees him, and wander and sit down at a table and order a drink, and I'm at the bar.
[01:26:24.201 --> 01:26:30.167]  Then he'll walk over to the bar to pick up his drink and spit out some information.
[01:26:30.973 --> 01:26:31.333]  We're good to go.
[01:26:50.775 --> 01:26:52.055]  Uh, for giving me information.
[01:26:52.116 --> 01:26:53.736]  And this is literal cloak and dagger.
[01:26:53.776 --> 01:27:03.739]  This is Bilderberg people that work for him, intelligence people, this is waiters, this is Major D's, this is people, uh, I'm just giving out random there, feds, and we're not actually saying who.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:18.224]  Uh, and, uh, I mean, imagine, we've got footage out the hotel windows of three cops in plainclothes walking around waiting for Tucker, covering their mouths up when they talk on their cell phones, their police cars, uh, uh, following you,
[01:27:20.707 --> 01:27:24.612]  I mean, this is right out of a movie, but it's not a movie.
[01:27:25.353 --> 01:27:28.097]  And the good news is that you're getting more and more support.
[01:27:28.157 --> 01:27:29.218]  I mean, what type of tidbits?
[01:27:29.238 --> 01:27:33.464]  I know you had sheet after sheet of notes, and how much of it turned out to be accurate?
[01:27:33.504 --> 01:27:34.645]  Was any of it disinfo?
[01:27:36.367 --> 01:27:43.472]  No, I think I have an instinct about, well, first of all, they won't give you, Bilderberg would not give you disinfo or anything at all.
[01:27:44.413 --> 01:27:56.581]  So, what sources tell you they truly believe, and now we have a track record of three decades of being right in projecting the Bilderberg goals.
[01:27:57.061 --> 01:28:05.707]  They either emerge in public, not by the name Bilderberg, but trying to as in Law of the Sea Treaty, or in other
[01:28:06.739 --> 01:28:09.781]  I mean, you're being followed by all these people.
[01:28:09.801 --> 01:28:10.962]  You get all this information.
[01:28:11.002 --> 01:28:12.923]  They talked about Bush, quote, has given up.
[01:28:13.003 --> 01:28:14.664]  Or Bush, quote, has surrendered.
[01:28:14.704 --> 01:28:17.866]  And then he announces a week later that we're going to submit to global taxation through the carbon tax.
[01:28:34.389 --> 01:28:37.772]  I mean, it's just... They run the world, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:43.398 --> 01:28:44.338]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.799 --> 01:28:46.400]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.321 --> 01:28:50.044]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.863 --> 01:28:55.024]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[01:28:55.044 --> 01:28:57.426]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.

[01:29:00.588 --> 01:29:01.268]  is a real thing.

[01:29:08.353 --> 01:29:13.617]  Allison molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,

[01:29:44.648 --> 01:29:47.513]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[01:29:53.072 --> 01:29:55.193]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:29:55.553 --> 01:29:58.614]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:29:58.874 --> 01:30:03.436]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:30:03.816 --> 01:30:06.437]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:30:06.917 --> 01:30:13.640]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:19.343]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.

[01:30:21.904 --> 01:30:25.245]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:30:25.745 --> 01:30:29.147]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[01:30:29.187 --> 01:30:36.190]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.

[01:30:52.922 --> 01:30:55.865]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:30:56.025 --> 01:31:01.250]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:06.855]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:31:07.255 --> 01:31:08.356]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:08.736 --> 01:31:17.804]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:31:18.064 --> 01:31:19.665]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:34.869]  On a lonely, lonesome highway in the east of Omaha I listen to the engine moaning and this one old song And I think about the woman, the girl you knew the night before But you'd probably soon be wondering
[01:32:45.982 --> 01:32:55.346]  I'll tell you one of the great things about my job.
[01:32:57.687 --> 01:33:03.110]  I get to associate with real iconic reporters and
[01:33:03.982 --> 01:33:14.027]  People who love liberty and the truth, like Jim Tucker, I get to associate with men and women, the listeners, the activists, who care about freedom, who are informed.
[01:33:15.688 --> 01:33:22.372]  I'm honored to be in a world of corrupt, evil, decadent slobs, to be associated with the cream of the crop of good people.
[01:33:22.972 --> 01:33:25.113]  And I am honored, and I salute all of you.
[01:33:44.764 --> 01:33:48.346]  We're going to go right back to Jim in your calls in just a moment and ask him the big question.
[01:33:49.387 --> 01:33:51.648]  Why do these people always bring him data?
[01:33:51.728 --> 01:33:52.848]  Why do they give him the leaks?
[01:33:52.949 --> 01:33:54.089]  Why do they give him the minutes?
[01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:57.251]  He's got a lot of their internal documents out for his sources.
[01:33:58.872 --> 01:34:02.114]  We'll answer that question and go to Allison, Mike, James, Randy, John, everybody.
[01:34:02.534 --> 01:34:05.696]  Maybe even twist his arm five minutes or so into the next hour so we have plenty of time with him.
[01:34:06.896 --> 01:34:09.978]  Before I do that, we have a great sponsor.
[01:34:10.098 --> 01:34:11.018]  It's eFoods Direct.
[01:34:11.078 --> 01:34:11.819]  That's the website.
[01:34:12.407 --> 01:34:18.171]  eFoodsDirect.com, the J. Michael Stevens Group, the oldest, longest, continual operating storable foods company in the nation.
[01:34:19.732 --> 01:34:21.173]  I've gotten storable foods from them twice.
[01:34:21.353 --> 01:34:21.734]  I love them.
[01:34:21.774 --> 01:34:23.515]  It's the best quality out there for the price.
[01:34:24.316 --> 01:34:27.278]  They're great patriots, and they give you great prices.
[01:34:28.098 --> 01:34:39.166]  And all I can say is, in these troubled times we're already in, and times that are no doubt going to get even more trying, it's a very secure feeling in your attic or in your garage to have a year's supply of food for yourself and your family.
[01:34:40.057 --> 01:34:45.486]  And even if you get a year's supply for one person with a family of four or five, that's three or four months apiece, or can supplement other food.
[01:34:45.906 --> 01:34:47.729]  They got two months supplies for individuals.
[01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:50.233]  I'd get a year's supply for every member of your family.
[01:34:50.293 --> 01:34:51.134]  Very easy to store.
[01:34:51.174 --> 01:34:52.016]  Lasts for ten years.
[01:34:54.890 --> 01:34:55.850]  Really high quality.

[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:24.387]  I've tried a lot of other green foods going back 5, 10 years ago because I knew they were really good for you, but they'd have too many herbs in them and give you a stomach ache or make you feel weird.
[01:35:24.867 --> 01:35:25.488]  Not interfood.
[01:35:25.528 --> 01:35:35.036]  It's 20 power packed ingredients and you take just two scoops in the morning with your juice or with your apple juice and it tastes good with that.
[01:35:35.096 --> 01:35:36.177]  It tastes okay without it.
[01:35:36.557 --> 01:35:38.039]  Other stuff, it tastes horrible with juice.
[01:35:38.949 --> 01:35:53.017]  And it's got dulse, kelp, barley grass, wheat grass, chlorella, spirulina, over 20 power-packed ingredients, balanced energy all day long, improved liver function, reduced food cravings, on and on and on, greater mental clarity, enerfood.com.

[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:13.121]  And by the way, coming up in about an hour, Paul Watson said he's going to post it.
[01:36:13.581 --> 01:36:15.702]  The extras from Endgame are unreleased yet.
[01:36:15.802 --> 01:36:20.664]  Some of you will be getting your DVDs today, because in five states, when we ship out of Texas, five states get it the day after.
[01:36:21.164 --> 01:36:23.164]  You'll be getting your mailbox at your front door today.
[01:36:23.184 --> 01:36:25.725]  We don't do mailboxes.
[01:36:26.546 --> 01:36:27.326]  It'll be at your door.
[01:36:28.466 --> 01:36:29.407]  But you'll be able to see them.
[01:36:29.427 --> 01:36:31.287]  But for the internet, it is released today.
[01:36:31.347 --> 01:36:32.788]  The extras in the next hour.
[01:36:34.028 --> 01:37:00.758]  and the trailer and the rest of it up there and uh... ten minutes about eleven minutes actually from istanbul uh... extra that's not in the film of Jim being followed by the spies and secret police uh... and a lot of other incredible things and that's just ten minutes of the forty minutes of extras that are coming out today uh... Jim just answering that question um... why do you think that so many people refuse at first to give you help in the past but then
[01:37:01.745 --> 01:37:14.012]  Yes, it's because of basic decency of a lot of good people.
[01:37:14.032 --> 01:37:18.474]  Initially, they just know there's going to be a big, important meeting.
[01:37:19.395 --> 01:37:25.298]  Now, understand that when Bilderberg does this, they can go completely over a big, snobbish resort
[01:37:25.899 --> 01:37:26.860]  We're good to go.
[01:37:54.011 --> 01:38:06.616]  And you start talking to them on say Monday before they start sealing place down at noon on Wednesday, just low-key, expressing your interest in the fact that something big must be going on here.
[01:38:06.636 --> 01:38:10.538]  Then the conversation goes on a little bit longer as they relax a bit.
[01:38:11.378 --> 01:38:16.420]  Then they realize that something evil is taking place and they want to help.
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:20.802]  I mean it started out in Canada way back early in the 80s.
[01:38:22.883 --> 01:38:23.283]  I remember
[01:38:24.469 --> 01:38:40.124]  Finding the little joint, wherever it was in Canada, across a gravel road from a huge resort, is where the staff went for their cheap beers and total sandwiches when they got off duty.
[01:38:41.205 --> 01:38:47.191]  So, the first evening I'm there, I tell them about my mission.
[01:38:49.574 --> 01:38:50.554]  And ask for their help.
[01:38:50.574 --> 01:38:51.895]  Tell them, please don't tell me your name.
[01:38:51.915 --> 01:38:54.536]  That way, if they put me on the rack, I can identify you by name.
[01:38:55.176 --> 01:38:57.256]  But don't take a chance on your job.
[01:38:57.276 --> 01:39:03.058]  If it's something that could go in the trash can, just put it in your pocket and give it to me in the evening.
[01:39:03.978 --> 01:39:12.981]  And the guy speaking only French said, through the barmaid who was the interpreter, no, they'd all be tired.
[01:39:13.001 --> 01:39:14.422]  They can't help at all.
[01:39:14.442 --> 01:39:15.542]  He's a ringleader.
[01:39:16.627 --> 01:39:30.935]  So I was feeling kind of down about that, but the following evening I came in, and he came in speaking perfect English, and he was carrying a lot of documents, and he said, they're trying to bleep my country and yours too.
[01:39:30.955 --> 01:39:32.656]  They'll help you all we can.
[01:39:33.297 --> 01:39:37.679]  So we met every evening and brought them around a beer.
[01:39:39.438 --> 01:39:44.983]  Well, that's the point here for the Newell Order, and they know it.
[01:39:45.444 --> 01:39:46.545]  We're going to get the truth out.
[01:39:46.625 --> 01:39:51.949]  We're the good guys, and most people are good, and that's why they cannot defeat the resistance.
[01:39:51.969 --> 01:39:52.730]  Do you agree, Jim?
[01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:53.130]  Yes.
[01:39:54.051 --> 01:39:57.655]  In fact, the goodness reaches up to the higher ranks, as I mentioned earlier.
[01:40:02.130 --> 01:40:02.710]  We're good to go.
[01:40:31.997 --> 01:40:36.959]  Evil is taking place and they want to help shed the spotlight on evil.
[01:40:37.039 --> 01:40:44.361]  And now it's got to the point where you're trailed everywhere and have to literally jump out of cars and go into alleys and go through shops and that's something else.
[01:40:44.381 --> 01:40:47.102]  Yes, they've got many foul photos of me.
[01:40:47.723 --> 01:40:59.587]  Years ago in Scotland, I'd grown a beard a couple times for those kids and the cop addressed me by name said, I know who you are Mr. Tucker.
[01:41:00.728 --> 01:41:08.352]  The cops at the entrance to the resort, where they saw horses up and spread out.
[01:41:09.233 --> 01:41:15.556]  So I knew then that there's no way I can be there without, be present without them knowing it's me.
[01:41:16.396 --> 01:41:20.978]  On the other hand, this is generated, it's heavily published in the European press.
[01:41:21.039 --> 01:41:23.720]  It's unlike the United States where the blackout is still 100%.
[01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:52.442]  Newspapers and broadcasters, that is the network broadcasters, those were owned by Bill O'Byrne, but in Europe there's a tremendous, well like in Canada, which you observed when we were up there, tremendous turnout by the, not just the local media, we've had guys come in from Britain and France to the Turkey meeting, and one guy came from a
[01:41:53.217 --> 01:41:54.158]  We're good to go.
[01:42:08.522 --> 01:42:18.968]  Well, I think it's going to educate a lot of Americans, and it's quite dramatic, and quite thorough, and certainly accurate, and I think it'll put it in perspective for a lot of people.
[01:42:19.608 --> 01:42:20.849]  Well, thank you for those words, Jim.
[01:42:20.869 --> 01:42:22.750]  Let's take a call from Allison in Florida.
[01:42:23.010 --> 01:42:24.011]  Thanks for holding, Allison.
[01:42:24.051 --> 01:42:28.073]  You're on the air with a true legend in investigative journalism, Jim Tucker.
[01:42:28.093 --> 01:42:31.895]  Hello?
[01:42:32.115 --> 01:42:32.715]  Yes, Allison.
[01:42:33.616 --> 01:42:34.196]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:42:34.236 --> 01:42:34.937]  The phone's out.
[01:42:35.077 --> 01:42:35.517]  That's okay.
[01:42:35.537 --> 01:42:35.797]  Go ahead.
[01:42:37.942 --> 01:42:48.250]  I bought the recent Rolling Stones with Bruce Springsteen on it, and there's an article on James Lovelock.
[01:42:49.911 --> 01:43:03.321]  The title is called The Prophet, and he is basically saying global warming is irreversible, and that 6 billion people will perish by the end of the century.
[01:43:04.312 --> 01:43:05.173]  Who is saying this?
[01:43:06.114 --> 01:43:07.474]  James Lovelock.
[01:43:07.815 --> 01:43:10.616]  He's um... And that's in Rolling Stone?
[01:43:11.437 --> 01:43:13.458]  It's in, yes, the latest Rolling Stones.
[01:43:13.858 --> 01:43:15.379]  I know a few months ago they wrote a similar one.
[01:43:15.419 --> 01:43:16.120]  I guess this is new.
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:17.301]  Well, that's another thing.
[01:43:17.361 --> 01:43:23.845]  They're going to engineer the plagues and the rest of it, and then they're going to blame it on sun-made global warming.
[01:43:24.645 --> 01:43:27.387]  And again, population is a huge part of their agenda.
[01:43:27.427 --> 01:43:32.050]  Jim, how big of the agenda in your research is world population production?
[01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:37.713]  Well, I've never heard them directly say we want to kill people.
[01:43:37.733 --> 01:43:47.281]  I've heard them worry about the world population, how it would suffer if it exceeded, I think, five or six billion, some such figure.
[01:43:48.142 --> 01:43:52.846]  But they did invent global warming long before it was an issue in this country.
[01:43:53.066 --> 01:43:58.931]  In fact, they made it an issue because they make such profits out of
[01:44:00.883 --> 01:44:02.564]  All these environmental things.
[01:44:02.744 --> 01:44:18.968]  On the other hand, there's a large number of climatologists, scientists with letters in the field who say it's just part of the old global warming that Al Gore also knows chicken little because he says the sky is falling all the time.
[01:44:18.988 --> 01:44:26.250]  It's just the normal cyclical earth patterns and weather.
[01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:27.570]  Absolutely.
[01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:29.331]  Anything else Allison?
[01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:40.317]  Um, they also have a small little part of the article where they say, how to save the human race, and they have five pointers.
[01:44:40.978 --> 01:44:42.059]  One is, grow nuclear.
[01:44:42.079 --> 01:44:44.281]  Two is, drink the oceans.
[01:44:44.641 --> 01:44:46.623]  Three is, grow synthetic foods.
[01:44:47.203 --> 01:44:49.005]  Four is, prepare for chaos.
[01:44:49.105 --> 01:44:51.187]  And five is, engineer the climate.
[01:44:51.767 --> 01:44:55.030]  And if I could elaborate on the fifth one, he says,
[01:44:56.506 --> 01:45:02.248]  Thousands of pipes in the ocean to increase plankton blooms and suck up vast qualities of CO2.
[01:45:03.549 --> 01:45:07.390]  Well, it's the plankton that need CO2.
[01:45:07.450 --> 01:45:09.351]  It's the earth that needs CO2.
[01:45:09.371 --> 01:45:10.992]  The earth breathes CO2.
[01:45:11.012 --> 01:45:11.572]  The plants.
[01:45:12.572 --> 01:45:17.774]  If they know, the public is so dumb that they're just going to say something that ridiculous and the people are going to buy into it.
[01:45:18.694 --> 01:45:22.476]  Yeah, and you know, there's people out there who truly
[01:45:23.588 --> 01:45:24.369]  Environmentalist.
[01:45:24.409 --> 01:45:25.810]  They want to take out mercury.
[01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:27.311]  They want to take out lead.
[01:45:27.332 --> 01:45:30.074]  They want to, you know, better the earth.
[01:45:30.094 --> 01:45:34.097]  Yeah, but this isn't true environmentalism.
[01:45:34.137 --> 01:45:35.218]  What's the title of the article?
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:37.680]  The Prophet.
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:46.528]  They basically have an illustration next to the article of basically a picture of the earth, but it looks like the moon.
[01:45:46.648 --> 01:45:51.532]  And then they have a man with no face cloaked in a dark red
[01:45:52.333 --> 01:45:55.975]  Alex, hey, great to talk to you, a big fan, and a big fan of Jim Tucker as well.
[01:46:15.011 --> 01:46:20.557]  It's a shame that you guys got stopped at the border in 2006 in Ottawa for the Bilderberg.
[01:46:20.917 --> 01:46:23.680]  I did, Jim did in that time, but he's been stopped many times.
[01:46:24.381 --> 01:46:31.828]  Right, and we're very impressed with the perseverance and dedication that you guys go about your business.
[01:46:31.908 --> 01:46:32.369]  Well, thank you.
[01:46:32.389 --> 01:46:33.570]  Do you have any questions or comments?
[01:46:34.211 --> 01:46:37.594]  Well, actually, I have a couple bullet points I'd like to make.
[01:46:39.082 --> 01:46:46.624]  Number one, thank you for having Connie Fogle on, the Canadian Action Party leader, which is the closest thing we have to Ron Paul.
[01:46:46.824 --> 01:46:47.084]  Yes.
[01:46:47.844 --> 01:46:51.805]  We are hugely in opposition to the North American Union.
[01:46:52.565 --> 01:46:58.247]  Any informed person knows American foreign policy is hurting us all.
[01:47:02.088 --> 01:47:04.949]  With all the election stuff going on with Ron Paul,
[01:47:07.998 --> 01:47:12.419]  I think it would be important if we knew if we could donate out of country.
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:17.421]  I know you guys have your $2,300 limit.
[01:47:18.241 --> 01:47:21.382]  You can help Ron Paul by going on the internet and U.S.
[01:47:21.422 --> 01:47:23.243]  sites and spreading the word about him.
[01:47:23.263 --> 01:47:23.983]  I gotta jump, Mike.
[01:47:24.003 --> 01:47:24.623]  Good to hear from you.
[01:47:24.663 --> 01:47:25.704]  Thanks for the kind words.
[01:47:26.084 --> 01:47:26.864]  James in Florida.
[01:47:26.884 --> 01:47:28.465]  Any questions for Jim Tucker?
[01:47:34.006 --> 01:47:34.907]  Okay, he's not there.
[01:47:34.927 --> 01:47:35.487]  Randy.
[01:47:37.196 --> 01:47:38.497]  Randy, where are you calling from?
[01:47:38.517 --> 01:47:39.537]  You're on the air with Jim Tucker.
[01:47:40.457 --> 01:47:41.218]  Randy or Randall?
[01:47:41.698 --> 01:47:42.238]  Whatever, sir.
[01:47:42.278 --> 01:47:42.558]  Go ahead.
[01:47:42.578 --> 01:47:43.818]  Do you have any questions or comments?
[01:47:45.319 --> 01:47:52.322]  I watched Endgame and you had in there a part about China, but it didn't really specify what it was.
[01:47:52.342 --> 01:47:53.782]  It was called the Great Leap Forward?
[01:47:54.742 --> 01:47:56.123]  Yes, and the Cultural Revolution.
[01:47:56.503 --> 01:47:56.783]  Right.
[01:47:57.403 --> 01:48:04.086]  And I just can't help but think how that reminds me of the NAFTA Superhighway and the way we had just-in-time shipping.
[01:48:05.575 --> 01:48:09.358]  For the stores, the food will be off the shelves within a couple of days.
[01:48:09.939 --> 01:48:15.143]  You're right, it brings total control and it's all about making us interdependent on them.
[01:48:17.786 --> 01:48:21.529]  Those were just systems that MAL tried to put in and they killed tens of millions of people.
[01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:23.691]  Is it Randy or Randall?
[01:48:24.171 --> 01:48:24.451]  Randall.
[01:48:24.892 --> 01:48:26.233]  Randall, what did you think of Endgame?
[01:48:26.953 --> 01:48:27.574]  I really liked it.
[01:48:27.954 --> 01:48:30.436]  I think you put it in perspective.
[01:48:32.682 --> 01:48:43.024]  You know, a linear fashion so that it would go from one base to support the other, the next topic, and so forth.
[01:48:43.064 --> 01:48:45.125]  Do you have any questions or comments for Jim Tucker?
[01:48:45.465 --> 01:48:57.647]  Yeah, I was wondering if the Bilderbergs came out with anything about the NAFTA or if there was anything they came out of the Bilderberg session about, like what's happening here in the U.S.
[01:48:57.887 --> 01:48:58.807]  That's a good question.
[01:48:58.927 --> 01:49:01.308]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[01:49:01.348 --> 01:49:01.948]  American Union.
[01:49:03.087 --> 01:49:08.191]  Yes, they're strongly fired, obviously, as they were the more ambitious plan of NAFTA.
[01:49:08.691 --> 01:49:16.617]  But one thing we have to remember also, you mentioned in an earlier segment about the UN tax.
[01:49:17.338 --> 01:49:28.887]  We always have to be on guard for the fact that there's at least three global tax bills pending before the UN that are in danger of being flipped through some easy.
[01:49:28.927 --> 01:49:30.408]  Their favorite is the tax on
[01:49:31.244 --> 01:49:32.025]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:32.045 --> 01:49:32.565]  A new world order.
[01:49:57.970 --> 01:50:02.172]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:50:02.873 --> 01:50:07.935]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group, with their objective being world domination.
[01:50:08.476 --> 01:50:10.917]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:11.657 --> 01:50:19.021]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:22.003 --> 01:50:26.986]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:27.447 --> 01:50:30.949]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.309 --> 01:50:33.831]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:33.891 --> 01:50:35.032]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.052 --> 01:50:35.812]  They're not after money.
[01:50:35.832 --> 01:50:36.913]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.113 --> 01:50:37.874]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.114 --> 01:50:38.774]  That's what happens.
[01:50:39.255 --> 01:50:43.798]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:50:43.998 --> 01:50:47.440]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:51:58.737 --> 01:52:02.960]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:10.246]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:52:10.666 --> 01:52:17.393]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:52:17.714 --> 01:52:19.316]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:52:19.616 --> 01:52:22.799]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:25.542]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:52:25.843 --> 01:52:32.570]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[01:52:42.014 --> 01:52:42.694]  This is the end.
[01:53:02.271 --> 01:53:17.595]  Alright, final segment with Jim Tucker.
[01:53:18.055 --> 01:53:21.436]  I'll continue with your calls into the next hour on any subject you wish to discuss at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:21.456 --> 01:53:21.516]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:29.378 --> 01:53:33.661]  Jim Tucker, a couple years ago, wrote the Bilderberg Diary full of photos on almost every page.
[01:53:33.681 --> 01:53:35.103]  He has 30 years covering them.
[01:53:35.903 --> 01:53:38.065]  And, by the way, we have that available at InfoWars.com.
[01:53:38.145 --> 01:53:41.728]  You can get it with Endgame, if you like, or get it from American Free Press.
[01:53:42.088 --> 01:53:44.130]  AmericanFreePress.net is the website.
[01:53:44.430 --> 01:53:46.472]  And, Jim, I know I'm throwing this out at you last minute.
[01:53:46.532 --> 01:53:47.212]  I don't have it in front of me.
[01:53:47.512 --> 01:53:49.234]  Do you know the toll-free number to American Free Press?
[01:53:51.743 --> 01:53:52.283]  No, I don't.
[01:53:52.323 --> 01:53:52.663]  I'm sorry.
[01:53:52.683 --> 01:53:53.984]  I never use it.
[01:53:54.504 --> 01:53:55.084]  No, I understand.
[01:53:55.324 --> 01:53:58.906]  I'll be checking in here while we talk to a caller.
[01:53:58.926 --> 01:54:03.048]  I just want to thank you for your service to this country and the world and to Liberty, my friend.
[01:54:03.629 --> 01:54:04.469]  Let's take a call.
[01:54:05.370 --> 01:54:07.531]  Let's go ahead now and go to James in Florida.
[01:54:07.591 --> 01:54:08.331]  James in Florida.
[01:54:08.351 --> 01:54:09.372]  You're on the air with Jim Tucker.
[01:54:10.332 --> 01:54:10.692]  Hey, Alex.
[01:54:10.712 --> 01:54:11.133]  How's it going?
[01:54:11.353 --> 01:54:11.553]  Good.
[01:54:11.593 --> 01:54:11.833]  Go ahead.
[01:54:12.747 --> 01:54:13.968]  Jim, I want to thank you.
[01:54:13.988 --> 01:54:24.311]  I've been following both you and Alex for a couple of years now and seen a lot of stuff and I've been watching this very closely, probably hundreds and hundreds of hours I've invested in my time into watching this.
[01:54:25.271 --> 01:54:37.655]  Are the Bilderbergs and the corporations and the people that are really working behind the scenes, are they backpedaling at all from the amount of work that you guys have done and been putting out there with publicity, the internet?
[01:54:38.813 --> 01:54:43.634]  I know I've spread the word like wildfire throughout all the network of my friends and my business.
[01:54:44.815 --> 01:54:49.796]  There must be some sort of counteracting going on here from their end.
[01:54:49.856 --> 01:54:50.696]  That's a great question.
[01:54:50.736 --> 01:54:53.037]  Let's get Jim, because he's got to leave in just a few minutes.
[01:54:53.077 --> 01:54:54.037]  It's a great question.
[01:54:54.417 --> 01:54:55.018]  Great caller.
[01:54:55.038 --> 01:54:56.018]  I appreciate it, James.
[01:54:57.158 --> 01:55:01.259]  Clearly, Jim, they are backpedaling, but they've got the wealth, so the agenda continues.
[01:55:01.579 --> 01:55:06.421]  They're just trying to go more stealth, and it's badly coordinated, but it is still moving forward, correct?
[01:55:07.978 --> 01:55:25.851]  Yes, but not at the pace that they had hoped for, and they're taking more precautions, trying very hard to avoid leaks by, for example, telling the Secretary of Defense and the other high officials, all participants, set aside these dates.
[01:55:26.792 --> 01:55:35.278]  More information follows, so there's less chance for a file clerk or a secretary to accidentally leak the location and time, because she doesn't have the letter on file that long.
[01:55:36.383 --> 01:55:44.828]  So, uh, they're taking every step imaginable trying to keep their meeting secret, and so far, unfortunately, they've failed miserably.
[01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:52.133]  And they were able to sneak attack with all the illegal aliens, but they were trying to do the coup de grace and totally decapitate the nation, and that's failed.
[01:55:52.533 --> 01:55:54.254]  So, again, we're in the fight of our lives.
[01:55:54.374 --> 01:55:55.715]  We do have a chance of winning.
[01:55:56.175 --> 01:55:57.796]  We just need all of you to take action.
[01:55:57.836 --> 01:56:00.218]  And, James, that was a great question that you asked.
[01:56:00.298 --> 01:56:01.819]  I did find the number to get, uh,
[01:56:02.578 --> 01:56:03.018]  I think so.
[01:56:25.844 --> 01:56:26.104]  699 News.
[01:56:26.145 --> 01:56:29.467]  Jim, you've got about 60 seconds in closing.
[01:56:29.907 --> 01:56:33.630]  I'll just say, bon voyage to you for now, and I love your work.
[01:56:33.670 --> 01:56:34.470]  Anything you want to add?
[01:56:35.551 --> 01:56:36.712]  No, I think it's quite complete.
[01:56:38.433 --> 01:56:41.135]  Well, good job, and say hi to everybody there at the paper for me.
[01:56:41.395 --> 01:56:44.937]  I sure will, and thanks for entertaining me.
[01:56:45.238 --> 01:56:46.959]  Thank you for being an endgame, my friend.
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:48.560]  Take care.
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:49.661]  There goes Jim Tucker.
[01:56:49.741 --> 01:56:51.242]  What a classic, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:51.282 --> 01:56:52.963]  Okay, I mean it when I say it.
[01:56:54.585 --> 01:56:54.925]  I mean it.
[01:56:54.965 --> 01:56:55.626]  You just watch.
[01:56:56.267 --> 01:56:57.327]  We're going to take a lot of your calls.
[01:56:58.008 --> 01:57:00.290]  I'm talking to John, I'm talking to Jim, and I'm talking to Jim.
[01:57:01.111 --> 01:57:04.454]  Those three calls in the five-minute segment, that means about a minute and a half apiece.
[01:57:05.835 --> 01:57:07.636]  When we come out of this break, I'm taking three calls.
[01:57:08.077 --> 01:57:10.739]  And when I go into the next 15-minute segment, I'm going to take ten calls.
[01:57:10.759 --> 01:57:11.059]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:11.079 --> 01:57:12.140]  Any issue you want, we're going
[01:57:16.141 --> 01:57:20.603]  Phone call, graffiti, whatever you want to talk about, but just have it quick, have it ready.
[01:57:20.643 --> 01:57:31.246]  I don't even care how good your question is, because my problem is I'll belabor on it for 20 minutes, and we're going to take a ton of your calls, cover a ton of news, in the third hour that is only 70 seconds away!
[01:57:33.327 --> 01:57:38.429]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.759 --> 01:57:53.941]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.601 --> 01:57:55.401]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.161 --> 01:57:57.082]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.722 --> 01:58:01.663]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.903 --> 01:58:05.985]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.234 --> 01:58:09.836]  We are now already into hour number 3.
[01:58:09.876 --> 01:58:14.018]  On this 30th day of October 2007.
[01:58:14.779 --> 01:58:16.280]  Wide open phones in this hour.
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:18.061]  A ton of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:58:18.601 --> 01:58:19.762]  Be sure and stay with us.
[01:58:20.042 --> 01:58:22.283]  New developments of the Martin Sheen.
[01:58:22.303 --> 01:58:23.304]  Going public on 9-11 Truth.
[01:58:23.384 --> 01:58:24.064]  All of it coming up.
[01:58:24.725 --> 01:58:27.747]  Right now, let's go to John in Amsterdam.
[01:58:27.767 --> 01:58:29.127]  I forgot you were calling from Amsterdam.
[01:58:29.147 --> 01:58:30.688]  I should have put you ahead of the line to talk to Jim.
[01:58:30.748 --> 01:58:32.069]  So you've got to talk to me.
[01:58:32.129 --> 01:58:33.210]  But John, good to hear from you.
[01:58:33.894 --> 01:58:35.175]  Yes, no worries, no worries.
[01:58:35.415 --> 01:58:36.815]  I've seen your Endgame show.
[01:58:36.935 --> 01:58:38.716]  Wonderful, excellent job, Alex.
[01:58:39.157 --> 01:58:39.457]  Thank you.
[01:58:39.477 --> 01:58:43.699]  I have deep respect for Jim Tucker and also deep respect for Daniel Eskelen.
[01:58:44.199 --> 01:58:46.120]  You know, to fight our cause.
[01:58:46.940 --> 01:58:47.841]  I have some good news.
[01:58:48.221 --> 01:58:58.046]  Alert, Sandy and me, we almost finished subtitling Endgame in Dutch subtitles and we're going to give some DVDs with cameras to the House of Parliament in the Netherlands.
[01:58:59.466 --> 01:59:02.988]  Oh, so you're going to give copies of my new film on DVD, subtitled?
[01:59:03.746 --> 01:59:05.127]  Well, they all know about the Bilderberg Group.
[01:59:05.147 --> 01:59:06.668]  They all know about the New World Order.
[01:59:06.728 --> 01:59:09.149]  They're trying to take down your country as you know right now.
[01:59:26.671 --> 01:59:31.473]  Yes, I want to apologize for all Dutch people allowing this propaganda of the Bilderbergers.
[01:59:31.513 --> 01:59:34.254]  Not everyone in Holland is happy about it.
[01:59:34.294 --> 01:59:40.156]  That we are, in 1954, that our so-called prince, who is a German by the way, he's not from Holland,
[01:59:40.816 --> 01:59:45.439]  But yes, we are not that happy about this, this Bilderbergers, this is a shame for the Netherlands.
[01:59:45.459 --> 01:59:55.007]  Well let me be clear, I mean, just because evil comes out of England or America or the Netherlands or anywhere, it doesn't mean that it's the, whenever I'm bashing those people that I'm bashing those countries.
[01:59:55.387 --> 01:59:58.189]  Like when I'm bashing China, I'm not bashing the Chinese people.
[01:59:58.569 --> 02:00:00.030]  And so I fully hear what you're saying.
[02:00:00.090 --> 02:00:02.112]  Call me back once it's out there.
[02:00:02.132 --> 02:00:02.612]  Anything else?
[02:00:02.932 --> 02:00:04.894]  There's one thing, there's one thing I want to say.
[02:00:04.994 --> 02:00:07.436]  On the website, the defense of the Netherlands,
[02:00:08.036 --> 02:00:18.299]  One guy has accomplished that they took off the page on Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda, claiming that they did 9-11, and guess what?
[02:00:18.339 --> 02:00:18.739]  They did it!
[02:00:18.799 --> 02:00:20.039]  They took off the page!
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:23.220]  One guy toning them up and saying, what is this?
[02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:24.101]  There's no evidence.
[02:00:24.361 --> 02:00:29.362]  Even the FBI is looking for evidence that the connection between Al-Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, and 9-11.
[02:00:29.902 --> 02:00:30.602]  And they took it off!
[02:00:30.842 --> 02:00:32.523]  The Department of Defense.
[02:00:32.543 --> 02:00:33.443]  We have all the evidence.
[02:00:33.963 --> 02:00:34.824]  Wow!
[02:00:34.944 --> 02:00:35.924]  Where is that posted?
[02:00:38.036 --> 02:00:53.221]  Not yet posted, but we are bringing it on soon with the translation in English that the Dutch defense base has been approached by one guy, one 9-1-1 shooter, and he, Wouter is his name, and he asked for questions, where's the evidence?
[02:00:53.341 --> 02:00:54.581]  And then they took it off the page.
[02:00:54.661 --> 02:01:00.183]  So we have a victory here in the Netherlands on this propaganda on 9-11.
[02:01:00.303 --> 02:01:00.863]  Thank you.
[02:01:01.224 --> 02:01:01.904]  God bless you.
[02:01:02.044 --> 02:01:02.564]  Keep it up.
[02:01:03.124 --> 02:01:04.365]  Let's talk to Jim in Oregon.
[02:01:04.425 --> 02:01:05.525]  Go ahead, Jim, you're on the air.
[02:01:08.089 --> 02:01:08.609]  Hi Alex.
[02:01:08.829 --> 02:01:09.329]  Hello Jim.
[02:01:09.349 --> 02:01:12.390]  Hi, I loved your movie, Endgame.
[02:01:12.430 --> 02:01:13.490]  I watched it last night.
[02:01:13.530 --> 02:01:14.611]  It was very powerful.
[02:01:14.631 --> 02:01:15.711]  I thought it was great.
[02:01:15.851 --> 02:01:16.271]  Thank you.
[02:01:16.951 --> 02:01:26.474]  My question is about Bilderberg and I'm wondering if there's a connection at all that you know of between Bilderberg and the Freemasons.
[02:01:27.474 --> 02:01:34.356]  Well, I mean Freemasons infest every major government and it's been all over the British and German and everything else news.
[02:01:35.826 --> 02:01:37.247]  Working together like a mafia.
[02:01:37.267 --> 02:01:42.989]  The lower level masons are porch masons, or profane masons, as the inner masons call them, and aren't involved in that.
[02:01:43.009 --> 02:01:49.271]  So we have to be careful talking about it so we don't bash innocent people who know they're innocent and they think we're lying about all the masons.
[02:01:49.311 --> 02:01:54.033]  But, yeah, I mean, there's masons in the Catholic Church, there's masons in the Protestant Church.
[02:01:54.073 --> 02:01:55.013]  We're basically running it.
[02:01:55.474 --> 02:01:57.994]  There's masons in all the major governments of the world.
[02:01:58.014 --> 02:01:59.395]  It's a secret society.
[02:01:59.875 --> 02:02:01.976]  And great power has been amassed there.
[02:02:03.610 --> 02:02:03.810]  Right.
[02:02:03.850 --> 02:02:06.734]  What about Bohemian Grove and Freemasonry?
[02:02:07.995 --> 02:02:09.617]  It basically is Freemasonic.
[02:02:09.637 --> 02:02:13.822]  You know, all the major trappings and they bring in the trappings of other Buddhist religions.
[02:02:13.862 --> 02:02:16.024]  They brought in the Native American ceremonies.
[02:02:16.525 --> 02:02:18.547]  They've done weird Catholic ceremonies.
[02:02:18.587 --> 02:02:19.067]  They've done...
[02:02:20.655 --> 02:02:23.597]  Just Shinto, the Japanese Buddhist sect.
[02:02:23.677 --> 02:02:24.657]  I mean, it's weird.
[02:02:25.418 --> 02:02:28.359]  They've got all sorts of shrines all over the 2,700 acres.
[02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:34.543]  I was only able to, you know, be in a couple hundred acres of it because there were agents and police everywhere.
[02:02:34.963 --> 02:02:38.085]  But the Grove has released all of those photos and materials.
[02:02:38.405 --> 02:02:40.086]  All right, we got two calls in that segment.
[02:02:40.346 --> 02:02:42.047]  We'll be right back to take a whole bunch more.
[02:02:45.889 --> 02:02:47.290]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:48.370 --> 02:02:49.371]  A new world order.
[02:02:50.117 --> 02:02:55.141]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:02:55.181 --> 02:02:56.742]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:02:56.762 --> 02:03:00.084]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[02:03:00.625 --> 02:03:03.067]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:03.807 --> 02:03:11.132]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:14.136 --> 02:03:19.139]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:23.102]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:23.462 --> 02:03:25.984]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[02:03:26.024 --> 02:03:27.185]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:27.205 --> 02:03:27.965]  They're not after money.
[02:03:27.985 --> 02:03:29.046]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:29.266 --> 02:03:29.666]  They're after power.
[02:03:29.706 --> 02:03:30.947]  That's what they're after, you see.
[02:03:31.408 --> 02:03:35.931]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:04:49.864 --> 02:04:51.726]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:04:51.927 --> 02:04:54.991]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:04:55.151 --> 02:04:58.295]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:04:58.615 --> 02:05:00.458]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:05:00.718 --> 02:05:04.420]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:05:04.701 --> 02:05:07.362]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:05:07.983 --> 02:05:12.285]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:05:12.485 --> 02:05:16.728]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:05:17.168 --> 02:05:21.489]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[02:05:21.809 --> 02:05:26.050]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:32.252]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[02:05:32.572 --> 02:05:35.013]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:05:35.213 --> 02:05:35.693]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:05:35.713 --> 02:05:36.813]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[02:05:46.703 --> 02:05:52.726]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.347 --> 02:05:56.328]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.967 --> 02:06:05.288]  9231.
[02:06:02.987 --> 02:06:05.288]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:05.868 --> 02:06:10.949]  The website is sirjonesreport.com, infowarriors.net, and now truthnews.us.
[02:06:10.969 --> 02:06:13.710]  I want to thank you for spreading the word on that new site.
[02:06:13.730 --> 02:06:14.950]  You've really done a great job, listeners.
[02:06:15.770 --> 02:06:21.511]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Jim in New York, and then Amy and others.
[02:06:21.551 --> 02:06:22.111]  Go ahead, Jim.
[02:06:22.792 --> 02:06:23.372]  Hello, Alex.
[02:06:23.752 --> 02:06:23.932]  Hi.
[02:06:24.292 --> 02:06:25.512]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:06:25.612 --> 02:06:26.872]  It was interesting.
[02:06:27.012 --> 02:06:29.453]  I caught part of the show with you and Jim.
[02:06:30.086 --> 02:06:31.827]  I hate to meet the two of you in a dark alley.
[02:06:32.728 --> 02:06:33.649]  Why's that?
[02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:35.950]  Because you know, you guys are good.
[02:06:36.491 --> 02:06:38.012]  And I say that as a compliment.
[02:06:38.512 --> 02:06:53.904]  But what I wanted to ask you was that I got to talking with a tenant of mine, and he's a security guard, and he said to me yesterday, we started talking about different things, and listen, any money you got, I would not keep all of it.
[02:06:53.924 --> 02:06:58.347]  You know, what to do financially, you know, buy metals, you know, and so forth.
[02:06:59.076 --> 02:07:17.229]  What I believe is going to happen, and we got it to the RFID chips, and he told me that after the holiday, he's in a mall on Long Island, and they're going to put the RFID chips in the badge.
[02:07:18.190 --> 02:07:22.213]  Now Mike, a question, are they going to do it with the money, eventually, and so forth?
[02:07:22.753 --> 02:07:23.594]  How about ammunition?
[02:07:25.328 --> 02:07:36.220]  It is now the law in California that the boxes have to be tagged and every gun sold there has to put your serial number tagged back to you to a database on the gun.
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:38.543]  That'll just bankrupt even more of the gun makers.
[02:07:38.883 --> 02:07:41.306]  That's like 20%, 30% of their market in the U.S.
[02:07:41.566 --> 02:07:42.527]  That'll cause U.S.
[02:07:42.567 --> 02:07:43.028]  adoption.
[02:07:43.048 --> 02:07:44.169]  What's adopted in New York
[02:07:44.807 --> 02:07:46.888]  Texas, Florida, but mainly California.
[02:07:46.908 --> 02:07:48.548]  But all those states are, as you know, key.
[02:07:48.969 --> 02:07:55.771]  But what is adopted in California isn't standardized with cars, washing machines, heating systems.
[02:07:55.911 --> 02:07:57.952]  All the standards are set to California.
[02:07:58.352 --> 02:08:06.195]  So it was a major, major, grievous stab wound directly to the heart by Schwarzenegger, the enemy of this country.
[02:08:06.835 --> 02:08:08.156]  That just passed two weeks ago.
[02:08:09.504 --> 02:08:11.085]  Absolute red-level crisis.
[02:08:11.865 --> 02:08:21.327]  In 2000, the Army said that by 2004, all products that it buys for manufacturers, from food to COTS, have to have RFID embedded.
[02:08:21.447 --> 02:08:28.389]  Walmart announced, and they, by the way, in 86, got the universal product code universally adopted, the barcode, with the Defense Department.
[02:08:28.489 --> 02:08:31.190]  See, this is how they get system-wide compliance.
[02:08:31.810 --> 02:08:34.571]  Already, a large percentage of products
[02:08:35.410 --> 02:08:38.316]  Uh, already have RFID in them.
[02:08:39.759 --> 02:08:41.502]  And now they're trying to forge universal.
[02:08:41.542 --> 02:08:45.169]  They're a few years behind, but yes, they're trying by 2008 to have everything in it.
[02:08:45.871 --> 02:08:46.933]  Every individual round.
[02:08:48.283 --> 02:08:49.804]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:08:49.884 --> 02:08:51.244]  The box itself?
[02:08:51.485 --> 02:09:10.634]  Well, the box is going to have RFID in California, and Europe's done this too, but they're going to make the gun, when the hammer falls, when the pin goes in, that it stamps your microscopic ID number tied to the store and tied to an electronic database for the gun.
[02:09:10.674 --> 02:09:12.015]  So it's the same thing.
[02:09:12.035 --> 02:09:16.737]  So I meant ultimately that if, God forbid, it ever comes to what's so
[02:09:17.273 --> 02:09:27.316]  So Zisten had said should have been done only without ax handles, that by that time you're not going to worry that it's going to be stamped to a, you know what I mean?
[02:09:27.396 --> 02:09:28.736]  I don't want to see that happen either.
[02:09:29.116 --> 02:09:35.498]  Well the stamp is the same thing as an RFID because all the RFID is a number, but it ties to a database.
[02:09:36.038 --> 02:09:38.038]  You see, and that's where the true tracking happens.
[02:09:38.398 --> 02:09:44.200]  Yeah, I understand, but if they were riding by, in other words, if you had ammo, okay, and they tracked
[02:09:45.098 --> 02:09:47.341]  Uh, you know, whatever it means, they use it as a device.
[02:09:47.361 --> 02:09:52.145]  They're going to track houses, and they're going to know this house here has ammo in it.
[02:09:52.546 --> 02:09:53.406]  Yes, yes, yes.
[02:09:53.527 --> 02:10:02.515]  And for 15 years, they've already had RFID, large strips, and all the money, $5 bills and up, and they can read and track that, and that's been admitted.
[02:10:02.555 --> 02:10:04.537]  You tell people that, and they just snicker and giggle at you.
[02:10:04.837 --> 02:10:05.778]  I appreciate your call.
[02:10:05.858 --> 02:10:06.519]  Great call.
[02:10:06.899 --> 02:10:08.381]  But we're moving quick, so I can take a lot of them.
[02:10:09.096 --> 02:10:12.419]  I'm trying to keep calls down to a minute and a half, two minutes, but they're all too good to do that.
[02:10:12.479 --> 02:10:13.159]  I'm trying, though.
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:16.622]  Amy in Hollywood, California, out there in the inferno.
[02:10:16.642 --> 02:10:17.282]  How you doing, Amy?
[02:10:17.542 --> 02:10:18.403]  Hey, Alex.
[02:10:18.523 --> 02:10:19.424]  I'm doing good.
[02:10:19.444 --> 02:10:28.550]  I'm a little nervous, but I just want to let you know that I went to your 9-11 convention on the 24th and 25th.
[02:10:29.671 --> 02:10:30.411]  Oh, last year.
[02:10:30.492 --> 02:10:30.732]  Great.
[02:10:30.752 --> 02:10:31.292]  Last year.
[02:10:31.312 --> 02:10:33.734]  So I've been following you all this time.
[02:10:33.754 --> 02:10:35.175]  I just got married.
[02:10:35.195 --> 02:10:37.937]  My husband and I watched Endgame last night, and we loved it.
[02:10:39.393 --> 02:10:46.777]  And my point is, I wanted to ask you, this New World Order thing is something that my father has been talking about since I was a kid.
[02:10:46.797 --> 02:10:50.158]  And basically, my family lives in Utah.
[02:10:50.918 --> 02:10:55.500]  They've been preparing for this time for a long time.
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:11:02.203]  And everything that you talk about, you know, they're not, they don't listen to you, but they get word.
[02:11:02.223 --> 02:11:03.404]  We've given them all your tapes.
[02:11:04.389 --> 02:11:12.311]  Your movies, and they've spread the word there in Little Southern Utah, and basically the word's come back that you are right on the money.
[02:11:13.251 --> 02:11:15.071]  And we got a lot of people praying for you.
[02:11:16.672 --> 02:11:23.233]  But my question is, this New World Order is so big and so massive, isn't it already, it's set in motion, it's already been written.
[02:11:23.753 --> 02:11:25.154]  This stuff is going to go down.
[02:11:26.114 --> 02:11:30.695]  And what can we do as, you know, as American people?
[02:11:30.755 --> 02:11:31.475]  I mean, other than
[02:11:32.068 --> 02:11:34.430]  Prepare for it, because it's already going to happen.
[02:11:36.571 --> 02:11:42.216]  Well, look, people thought that Hitler was the Antichrist, and so they laid down to him in Europe.
[02:11:42.636 --> 02:11:43.777]  A lot of good people did.
[02:11:43.797 --> 02:11:46.859]  And there's no doubt that the major crisis is coming now.
[02:11:46.919 --> 02:11:49.761]  Hitler, all that was just a foreshadowing, was just a prototype.
[02:11:50.141 --> 02:11:52.904]  Stalin, Mao, all of it.
[02:11:53.984 --> 02:11:55.426]  But we don't have a place to run.
[02:11:55.446 --> 02:12:01.051]  If there was a new world or someplace I could go and be left alone, believe me, I would do it.
[02:12:01.131 --> 02:12:02.572]  It's a very sick, wicked culture.
[02:12:02.732 --> 02:12:03.913]  Evil is spreading everywhere.
[02:12:04.033 --> 02:12:04.994]  It's not just the government.
[02:12:05.054 --> 02:12:06.135]  It's us, too.
[02:12:06.575 --> 02:12:07.656]  We're bathed in evil.
[02:12:07.796 --> 02:12:11.600]  I struggle not to be wicked myself, and it's literally a daily struggle.
[02:12:12.453 --> 02:12:13.475]  I don't think so.
[02:12:27.857 --> 02:12:31.319]  All I know is fighting bullies is always better, going head up against them.
[02:12:31.339 --> 02:12:32.719]  They would have already had their New World War.
[02:12:32.759 --> 02:12:34.840]  They would have already had the population extermination.
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:37.281]  They've already done a lot of that, but a lot much larger.
[02:12:37.301 --> 02:12:39.982]  They would have already done all the other parts of their agenda.
[02:12:40.022 --> 02:12:44.004]  Instead, they're like a giant juggernaut that ran into a huge field of mud.
[02:12:44.064 --> 02:12:56.009]  We're that field of mud, and it's still kind of moving forward, but it's engines overheating, it's blowing gaskets, it's like five feet down in the mud, and it's still got some momentum, but it's slowing, slowing, slowing.
[02:12:56.730 --> 02:12:57.651]  That's what the Bible says.
[02:12:57.711 --> 02:13:07.836]  It's going to basically just slow down, and right as it stops, it'll have world government, and then right as they get world government, everything starts exploding and falling apart, and that's what I see happening.
[02:13:07.856 --> 02:13:21.643]  And not just because it's in the Bible, that's what I see geopolitically, is that with the genetic engineering and the weapons and all of it and the population explosion and everybody fighting with each other, there's no doubt we're going into very interesting times.
[02:13:22.785 --> 02:13:25.367]  And so all I know is I'm trying to warn everybody I can.
[02:13:25.387 --> 02:13:28.210]  I'm trying to tell them, hey, acting cool and being a yuppie isn't important.
[02:13:28.691 --> 02:13:33.136]  Being prepared, having friends that love you, having people you can count on is what's important.
[02:13:33.835 --> 02:13:35.436]  And you better get geared up for it now.
[02:13:35.836 --> 02:13:38.177]  I don't know, again, it's the government saying gear up for it.
[02:13:38.197 --> 02:13:43.699]  It's like you heard earlier, Rolling Stone saying, you know, six billion dead, new world order, but it's all good.
[02:13:43.719 --> 02:13:55.002]  I mean, it's just, they're creating global crises, and they accentuate every problem we already have, and then they always offer a solution out of a crisis they created or that they made even worse, exacerbated.
[02:13:55.023 --> 02:13:58.204]  It seems like there's going to be some sort of revolution that's going to take place.
[02:13:58.264 --> 02:14:01.825]  It seems like, right now, there are so many people that are, like, coming out and
[02:14:02.285 --> 02:14:06.048]  And I feel that you have a big part to do with that.
[02:14:06.788 --> 02:14:08.410]  Well, look, I mean, it's not me.
[02:14:08.430 --> 02:14:25.642]  It's troops are seeing the torture and the pallets of $100 bills in Iraq and the drug dealing, and the FBI agents are seeing them being ordered to stand down with Al-Qaeda, and they're seeing the trillions missing from the Pentagon, and the FBI agents in the White House are seeing the gay prostitutes.
[02:14:25.722 --> 02:14:26.843]  I mean, they're just seeing it all.
[02:14:27.163 --> 02:14:29.285]  I mean, people who are out there in the world are seeing it.
[02:14:29.825 --> 02:14:32.045]  And then they hear me talk about it, they already know it.
[02:14:32.366 --> 02:14:33.766]  You see, it's the people in the system.
[02:14:33.786 --> 02:14:34.646]  Look, it's a crisis.
[02:14:34.706 --> 02:14:40.967]  It's good and evil coming like two freight trains going 100 miles an hour a piece, head on towards each other.
[02:14:41.447 --> 02:14:44.308]  And I just put my faith in God and try to take action and do the right thing.
[02:14:44.568 --> 02:14:45.528]  Good to hear from you, Amy.
[02:14:45.568 --> 02:14:46.548]  I really appreciate your call.
[02:14:46.568 --> 02:14:47.468]  Let's get one more in.
[02:14:48.088 --> 02:14:48.969]  Juan in Texas.
[02:14:48.989 --> 02:14:49.869]  You're on the air, Juan.
[02:14:50.969 --> 02:14:51.769]  Hi, Alex.
[02:14:52.249 --> 02:14:53.149]  I'm a new listener.
[02:14:54.389 --> 02:14:56.910]  You said a couple of times your eyes are opening.
[02:14:57.979 --> 02:15:00.080]  I think I'm one of those guys that you're talking about.
[02:15:00.901 --> 02:15:01.661]  Well, my question is this.
[02:15:02.682 --> 02:15:11.927]  The Japanese, I know, are making, like, they have an embassy in Peru, and I think they had a Japanese president in Peru.
[02:15:12.047 --> 02:15:14.048]  Who carried out massive eugenics operations.
[02:15:14.849 --> 02:15:17.550]  Yeah, so, are the Asians in?
[02:15:17.570 --> 02:15:25.155]  The Japanese leadership are probably the biggest worshippers of eugenics out there, after the British and the Germans.
[02:15:26.138 --> 02:15:26.538]  They are.
[02:15:26.578 --> 02:15:29.180]  They just love it like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[02:15:30.021 --> 02:15:41.428]  And, uh, yeah, that president who had to flee with all those felonies and hundreds of millions missing, carried out, he took all the IMF World Bank money and they sterilized half their women and it was just a night, a reign of terror, uh, under him.
[02:15:42.509 --> 02:15:43.370]  His name escapes me.
[02:15:43.410 --> 02:15:44.370]  I didn't even put him in the film.
[02:15:44.430 --> 02:15:45.011]  I meant to.
[02:15:45.031 --> 02:15:46.472]  It's just, that's what I mean.
[02:15:46.592 --> 02:15:47.592]  People, you have no idea.
[02:15:47.612 --> 02:15:49.514]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[02:15:49.534 --> 02:15:51.415]  They ran giant eugenics ops.
[02:15:52.836 --> 02:15:55.758]  It was mainly against the native, the native populations.
[02:15:58.206 --> 02:15:59.687]  Are they also part of it?
[02:16:00.988 --> 02:16:04.272]  They are absolute New World Order like you cannot even imagine.
[02:16:05.673 --> 02:16:06.554]  Highest levels.
[02:16:07.094 --> 02:16:07.395]  Thank you.
[02:16:07.715 --> 02:16:08.796]  Yeah, thank you so much.
[02:16:08.956 --> 02:16:17.144]  I mean, it's just, it's... I mean, the God Emperor over there, Perahito, was worshipped as God.
[02:16:17.185 --> 02:16:19.527]  They believe the elite has royal, God-like bloodlines.
[02:16:20.356 --> 02:16:22.857]  Eugenics was really a science tailored for royals.
[02:16:22.917 --> 02:16:24.478]  It was a science tailored for them.
[02:16:24.778 --> 02:16:26.339]  We're going to extend your life, Majesty.
[02:16:26.359 --> 02:16:27.940]  We're going to get you the perfect mate, Majesty.
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:29.901]  We're going to make your children the best, Majesty.
[02:16:29.921 --> 02:16:33.123]  We're going to kill and cull the herd, Your Majesty.
[02:16:33.943 --> 02:16:38.986]  And they took thousands of American and British GIs, Australian GIs,
[02:16:39.907 --> 02:16:46.130]  And they tortured them in bio-weapons experiments that are just unbelievable, and they were all given pardons, all brought over here to the U.S.
[02:16:46.550 --> 02:16:51.492]  They all handed over their material and worked with the Nazi scientists to develop what we now have ruling over us today.
[02:16:52.752 --> 02:16:53.532]  And that's my point.
[02:16:53.873 --> 02:16:58.935]  Look, Endgame has thousands of things that isn't in it.
[02:17:00.395 --> 02:17:04.817]  Great article written last week that we, um, I forget the exact site, uh, it's Old Thinker News, I think?
[02:17:05.738 --> 02:17:11.282]  Uh, doesn't matter, we posted it on Prison Planet and TruthNews.us saying, Endgame, the rabbit hole doesn't stop here.
[02:17:11.903 --> 02:17:20.729]  Yeah, it's a two hour, twenty minute film, and for twenty minutes in rapid succession, I just list declassified examples of the government kills our men, women, and children.
[02:17:21.350 --> 02:17:24.432]  In cold blood with biochemical, radiological tests, knowing it'll kill them.
[02:17:25.433 --> 02:17:29.356]  That's not just about testing what kills us, it's about creating cadres that'll follow orders.
[02:17:30.216 --> 02:17:30.817]  Cadres.
[02:17:31.637 --> 02:17:32.178]  And they've got
[02:17:33.055 --> 02:17:35.722]  Hundreds of thousands of cold-blooded scientists and killers.
[02:17:36.263 --> 02:17:37.446]  They will do whatever they're told.
[02:17:38.228 --> 02:17:39.050]  That's who we face.
[02:17:39.611 --> 02:17:40.453]  The facts are in.
[02:17:40.473 --> 02:17:42.037]  Endgame is out.
[02:17:45.635 --> 02:17:46.095]  Gold.
[02:17:46.415 --> 02:17:47.676]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:17:47.956 --> 02:17:54.038]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:17:54.238 --> 02:17:58.040]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:00.300]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:00.340 --> 02:18:02.621]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:18:02.781 --> 02:18:09.664]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker as
[02:18:09.864 --> 02:18:11.025]  We're good to go.
[02:18:24.821 --> 02:18:26.042]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:26.062 --> 02:18:30.204]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[02:18:55.288 --> 02:19:02.173]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[02:19:03.234 --> 02:19:11.820]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[02:19:12.921 --> 02:19:20.907]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:19:24.231 --> 02:19:24.611]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:24.651 --> 02:19:25.032]  Call now.

[02:19:45.330 --> 02:19:47.690]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[02:19:48.231 --> 02:19:49.711]  After a pedicure they look great.
[02:19:50.051 --> 02:19:53.872]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[02:19:54.312 --> 02:19:56.512]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[02:19:56.932 --> 02:20:00.273]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:20:00.673 --> 02:20:03.133]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:20:03.653 --> 02:20:04.694]  What's that name again?
[02:20:05.094 --> 02:20:06.274]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:20:06.654 --> 02:20:07.834]  It's CalX.
[02:20:08.214 --> 02:20:10.075]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[02:20:10.415 --> 02:20:12.255]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[02:20:13.044 --> 02:20:21.666]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:20:22.086 --> 02:20:27.808]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing CalX ointment.
[02:20:28.208 --> 02:20:39.331]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, HEV grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:20:39.989 --> 02:20:41.089]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:42.089]  I'll be right back.
[02:20:42.210 --> 02:20:43.970]  I'm getting some callux for my heels.
[02:20:46.130 --> 02:20:47.371]  This is Elizabeth Border.
[02:20:47.911 --> 02:20:48.611]  News alert.
[02:20:49.091 --> 02:20:53.312]  Twice a month you can now get the Divided Kingdom's brand new newsletter.
[02:20:53.752 --> 02:20:58.573]  Concise, hard-hitting, the first issue discusses two vital questions.
[02:20:58.593 --> 02:21:00.053]  War in Iran?
[02:21:00.073 --> 02:21:02.254]  A coming One World Church?
[02:21:03.014 --> 02:21:08.319]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.
[02:21:08.819 --> 02:21:16.266]  For a free sample copy of the Divided Kingdom dossier, write to Post Office Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland, 21609.
[02:21:18.588 --> 02:21:24.834]  A yearly subscription is only $50 for a newsletter that comes not once, but twice every month.
[02:21:25.374 --> 02:21:30.940]  Get the spiritual support you need right now for your free sample copy to P.O.
[02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:34.323]  Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland, 21609.
[02:21:34.783 --> 02:21:40.369]  Once again, for your free copy of the Divided Kingdom Dossier newsletter, write to P.O.
[02:21:40.389 --> 02:21:42.090]  Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland, 21609.
[02:22:10.725 --> 02:22:22.972]  Yeah, you got that Forbes writer saying the Chinese Mafia and the Japanese Mafia are mad about eugenics and the World Extermination Plan.
[02:22:24.393 --> 02:22:25.174]  And maybe that's true.
[02:22:25.214 --> 02:22:27.315]  I mean, I believe that Benjamin Fulford believes it.
[02:22:28.115 --> 02:22:31.838]  The problem is that the Japanese at every step have been carrying out eugenics.
[02:22:32.238 --> 02:22:34.200]  They've been carrying it out in countries they get control of.
[02:22:34.220 --> 02:22:36.242]  They were doing it in the 30s in South Korea.
[02:22:36.762 --> 02:22:38.223]  They were doing it in Southern China in the 30s.
[02:22:38.364 --> 02:22:41.826]  I mean, they are like, they were on this day one.
[02:22:41.987 --> 02:22:42.907]  They love it.
[02:22:43.708 --> 02:22:45.149]  That is their leadership, not their people.
[02:22:45.950 --> 02:22:49.413]  But their people have been trained under imperial conditioning to be subservient.
[02:22:49.593 --> 02:22:50.814]  Very intelligent, great people.
[02:22:51.154 --> 02:22:52.095]  They've been trained to be, you know,
[02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.750]  Very repressed.
[02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:54.451]  Very controlled.
[02:22:54.471 --> 02:22:55.331]  Imperial condition.
[02:22:55.351 --> 02:22:56.212]  Look how the British act.
[02:22:56.252 --> 02:22:57.552]  Used to be a bunch of wild barbarians.
[02:22:57.592 --> 02:23:00.754]  Now they're... Oh, yes, they're... You know, a lot of them.
[02:23:00.774 --> 02:23:04.895]  Now, a lot of them aren't like that now, but... You know, bowing and stooping and groveling.
[02:23:05.816 --> 02:23:07.717]  And so they can just carry out their enjoyment with us.
[02:23:07.777 --> 02:23:08.457]  Their feudalism.
[02:23:08.477 --> 02:23:09.037]  Their serfdom.
[02:23:09.057 --> 02:23:09.638]  Their control.
[02:23:10.498 --> 02:23:13.219]  Where you got caught taking a rabbit off your own land.
[02:23:13.239 --> 02:23:14.260]  You know, a little plot you could have.
[02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:14.820]  They'd kill you.
[02:23:16.401 --> 02:23:18.322]  Boy, they were a foot and a half taller than the slaves.
[02:23:19.242 --> 02:23:20.343]  That's what feudalism is.
[02:23:20.703 --> 02:23:20.883]  And, um...
[02:23:22.228 --> 02:23:24.670]  So all I see is the Asians just on board with this.
[02:23:25.751 --> 02:23:26.512]  That's all I see.
[02:23:26.532 --> 02:23:29.434]  I mean, China intruded the one-child policy.
[02:23:29.454 --> 02:23:38.181]  They were the first to do it in 1981 under UN funding, under treaties signed six years before with Bush when he was ambassador.
[02:23:38.542 --> 02:23:39.442]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[02:23:42.245 --> 02:23:44.967]  Let's talk to Michael in Maine.
[02:23:45.007 --> 02:23:45.527]  You're on the air.
[02:23:45.547 --> 02:23:45.908]  Go ahead.
[02:23:46.488 --> 02:23:47.329]  Well, hello Alex.
[02:23:47.689 --> 02:23:51.072]  It seems as though you intuited the subject I was going to talk about.
[02:23:51.647 --> 02:23:52.907]  I can ask you about personally.
[02:23:53.487 --> 02:23:56.608]  I've spent a lot of time recently researching the book The Union Jack.
[02:23:56.628 --> 02:23:57.488]  Are you familiar with that?
[02:23:58.308 --> 02:23:59.428]  No, but I can guess.
[02:23:59.488 --> 02:24:00.949]  Is it about Anglo-American power?
[02:24:01.389 --> 02:24:02.229]  It is, actually.
[02:24:02.349 --> 02:24:10.010]  And it was written in 71, which makes it even more interesting because it doesn't place the criticism of the body politic in our time frame.
[02:24:10.711 --> 02:24:14.591]  And yet almost everything it says about it rings true to things that have already happened.
[02:24:15.251 --> 02:24:18.192]  And it's on Ken Adachi's website, educate-yourself.org.
[02:24:19.133 --> 02:24:21.054]  Well, I'm not familiar with that.
[02:24:21.194 --> 02:24:22.555]  I know, I think I've seen that site.
[02:24:23.075 --> 02:24:25.237]  I just found it, you know, just through luck.
[02:24:25.737 --> 02:24:35.783]  But I took the PDF I've been reading the book, and basically what it propounds is that the British have been planning to indoctrinate us in Bible prophecy.
[02:24:36.984 --> 02:24:38.325]  Yeah.
[02:24:38.745 --> 02:24:40.186]  Royal Israelism.
[02:24:40.806 --> 02:24:42.087]  Right, British Israelism.
[02:24:42.888 --> 02:24:44.769]  Which is originally royal.
[02:24:45.766 --> 02:24:55.479]  Israelism, for 300 years plus, all of the kings and queens are coronated on what they believe is Jacob's stone, and they believe they are the true Israelites.
[02:24:55.519 --> 02:24:57.161]  It isn't just indoctrinating, they believe it.
[02:24:57.922 --> 02:25:01.166]  Right, and this thing, okay, they believe it precisely.
[02:25:01.226 --> 02:25:02.047]  Now here's another thing.
[02:25:02.487 --> 02:25:03.549]  The kingdom message
[02:25:04.241 --> 02:25:05.241]  I see it on your website.
[02:25:05.501 --> 02:25:07.502]  Of course, it's a free speech thing.
[02:25:07.542 --> 02:25:08.622]  I'm not oppressed by it.
[02:25:08.903 --> 02:25:11.343]  What are you talking about?
[02:25:11.743 --> 02:25:16.185]  Revealing his kingdom, his joys and sorrows, isn't that a banner that runs on your website occasionally?
[02:25:16.205 --> 02:25:17.705]  Yeah, we got Google Ads.
[02:25:17.945 --> 02:25:22.807]  I'm not bashing that sponsor because I don't know them, but we're constantly, we probably ban hundreds
[02:25:24.462 --> 02:25:25.162]  I don't agree with.
[02:25:25.182 --> 02:25:28.145]  The problem is either we can operate or we can not operate.
[02:25:29.606 --> 02:25:39.412]  I'm constantly banning Rife bubble machines and alien junk and Jew-bashing stuff.
[02:25:39.692 --> 02:25:40.473]  We're trying, okay?
[02:25:41.013 --> 02:25:41.674]  Okay, well thank you.
[02:25:43.055 --> 02:25:47.698]  The book pointed out that the British Empire goes under the moniker of the Kingdom of God.
[02:25:48.143 --> 02:25:50.264]  So, wherever the King... You got that?
[02:25:50.744 --> 02:25:51.244]  Are you with that?
[02:25:51.424 --> 02:25:52.064]  Yeah.
[02:25:52.085 --> 02:25:52.925]  Not books about it.
[02:25:52.965 --> 02:25:55.306]  I've read books written by the British about it.
[02:25:55.946 --> 02:25:56.146]  Right.
[02:25:56.806 --> 02:26:04.889]  And do you see that, potentially, that the financial power of London is behind the world fundamentalist Christian and perhaps fundamentalist Islamic ministry?
[02:26:06.270 --> 02:26:08.611]  Well, I know that the... See, here's the problem.
[02:26:08.651 --> 02:26:09.671]  I said I'm taking a lot of calls.
[02:26:09.691 --> 02:26:11.792]  This is an extremely complex issue.
[02:26:12.332 --> 02:26:13.633]  Extremely complex.
[02:26:13.673 --> 02:26:14.613]  Well, can I make it simple?
[02:26:15.376 --> 02:26:17.557]  British fighter jets flew over here a couple days ago.
[02:26:17.577 --> 02:26:18.117]  This is Maine.
[02:26:18.757 --> 02:26:21.758]  British fighter jets are flying over and they're stationed up in Bangor.
[02:26:22.198 --> 02:26:22.438]  Okay?
[02:26:23.278 --> 02:26:27.379]  And you know this treaty they just signed, this anti-terrorism, homegrown terrorism?
[02:26:27.619 --> 02:26:28.400]  You heard about this?
[02:26:28.860 --> 02:26:29.780]  Yes, we've been covering it.
[02:26:30.140 --> 02:26:30.400]  Okay.
[02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:39.703]  Line 9 in the italicized section says, we're going to seek the United Kingdom to advise us on how to deal with our homegrown terrorists.
[02:26:39.863 --> 02:26:40.163]  Yes.
[02:26:40.363 --> 02:26:44.044]  So what this basically says to me is, we, your traitorous Congress,
[02:26:44.457 --> 02:26:47.379]  are going to side with the British against you, the American people.
[02:26:47.460 --> 02:26:49.641]  Well, I mean, who did we have two wars with?
[02:26:50.002 --> 02:26:50.922]  Who's our real enemy?
[02:26:52.344 --> 02:27:13.321]  But the thing that I want to warn your readers and listeners and subscribers about is that the spiritual deception is to the point of a big game of good cop, bad cop, where they used World War III to break us down with psychological trauma and loss to the point where when the Messiah steps forward, the good cop comes forward, that we genuinely open our hearts
[02:27:15.108 --> 02:27:18.890]  Well, that's what the Bible says is gonna happen, and I appreciate your call.
[02:27:20.210 --> 02:27:23.231]  The sun never set on the British Empire, and it never did set.
[02:27:24.152 --> 02:27:25.772]  They learned how to take their flag down.
[02:27:26.433 --> 02:27:27.893]  But again, it isn't even the British people.
[02:27:27.933 --> 02:27:29.374]  They're some of the most enslaved out there.
[02:27:29.994 --> 02:27:31.795]  It's that evil that sits in London.
[02:27:31.815 --> 02:27:32.515]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.076 --> 02:27:37.017]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.477 --> 02:27:39.077]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.998 --> 02:27:42.719]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.078 --> 02:27:47.479]  It is a big idea.
[02:27:47.499 --> 02:27:49.620]  A new world order.
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:54.562]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:27:55.222 --> 02:27:56.963]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:27:58.023 --> 02:28:00.264]  Both their objective be world domination.
[02:28:00.825 --> 02:28:03.286]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:28:04.006 --> 02:28:11.369]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:28:14.358 --> 02:28:19.341]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:28:19.822 --> 02:28:23.284]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:28:23.664 --> 02:28:26.186]  Bill Barrett is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:28:26.226 --> 02:28:27.227]  Most people have no idea.
[02:28:27.247 --> 02:28:28.167]  They're not after money.
[02:28:28.187 --> 02:28:29.248]  They have all the money they need.
[02:28:29.468 --> 02:28:29.888]  They're after power.
[02:28:29.908 --> 02:28:31.229]  That's what they're after, isn't it?
[02:28:31.610 --> 02:28:39.795]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:28:39.955 --> 02:28:42.877]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:28:43.117 --> 02:28:44.158]  You have been warned.
[02:28:45.058 --> 02:28:50.442]  If you own a business, you may know that incorporating can be a smart way to protect yourself and your assets.
[02:28:50.642 --> 02:28:54.004]  So the question is, why haven't you incorporated your business yet?
[02:28:54.164 --> 02:28:54.684]  My business?
[02:28:55.104 --> 02:28:56.125]  It's too small.
[02:28:56.205 --> 02:29:01.308]  The simple truth is, no matter how small your business, you run the risk of losing your personal assets.
[02:29:01.528 --> 02:29:03.029]  Your car, your home, even your house.
[02:29:05.959 --> 02:29:08.061]  Incorporating is very complicated.
[02:29:08.641 --> 02:29:11.182]  Actually, incorporating is easy and fast.
[02:29:11.403 --> 02:29:12.863]  You can do it in just 10 minutes.
[02:29:13.064 --> 02:29:15.785]  Call now for your free guide from the Company Corporation.
[02:29:15.805 --> 02:29:16.265]  1-800-331-1461.
[02:29:16.466 --> 02:29:20.588]  I need a lawyer to incorporate.
[02:29:20.628 --> 02:29:22.149]  That's really expensive.
[02:29:22.689 --> 02:29:24.290]  You don't need a lawyer to incorporate.
[02:29:24.530 --> 02:29:25.911]  Use the Company Corporation.
[02:29:26.011 --> 02:29:27.712]  They don't offer legal or financial advice.
[02:29:27.772 --> 02:29:29.353]  They just make incorporating simple.
[02:29:29.513 --> 02:29:32.415]  Their only mission is to help people like you incorporate safely
[02:29:35.895 --> 02:29:36.095]  That's 1-800-331-1461.
[02:29:46.385 --> 02:29:48.186]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[02:29:48.466 --> 02:29:51.308]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[02:29:51.808 --> 02:29:54.009]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[02:29:54.650 --> 02:30:02.954]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[02:30:03.415 --> 02:30:03.975]  An example?
[02:30:04.495 --> 02:30:07.357]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[02:30:08.217 --> 02:30:10.999]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[02:30:11.359 --> 02:30:14.641]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[02:30:15.396 --> 02:30:20.578]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[02:30:21.219 --> 02:30:22.699]  Money is not the problem.
[02:30:22.919 --> 02:30:23.920]  Availability is.
[02:30:24.440 --> 02:30:26.301]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[02:30:26.541 --> 02:30:30.223]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[02:30:30.843 --> 02:30:32.924]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[02:30:32.944 --> 02:30:34.005]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:30:34.025 --> 02:30:34.065]  800-409-5633.
[02:30:49.198 --> 02:30:50.666]  Day after day, alone
[02:30:55.965 --> 02:31:02.351]  We've got to just briefly talk about what's happening over in England.
[02:31:24.049 --> 02:31:27.952]  The Romans ran all beyond, that was it's old name, the Britannia.
[02:31:29.673 --> 02:31:35.157]  Then by about 300 A.D.
[02:31:35.277 --> 02:31:39.159]  the Romans started pulling out very quickly and they had imploded by 400 A.D.
[02:31:39.619 --> 02:31:40.080]  completely.
[02:31:41.861 --> 02:31:46.064]  But there was some technology, some statecraft, some systems of control still left there.
[02:31:47.104 --> 02:31:50.867]  And English itself is the world dominant language, and officially the world language.
[02:31:51.565 --> 02:32:02.029]  Because it is an amalgamation of three or four Germanic tongues, French, Latin, Greek, and then it adopts anything it comes in contact with.
[02:32:02.069 --> 02:32:04.170]  It just grows and grows, like the Borg.
[02:32:04.190 --> 02:32:06.231]  I think it's a great language, too.
[02:32:06.611 --> 02:32:14.555]  I mean, people, you know, top linguists and others that I've talked to say it's one of the hardest languages to learn the subtleties of, or even to learn.
[02:32:16.355 --> 02:32:18.076]  Because it's a whole bunch of languages.
[02:32:18.156 --> 02:32:19.797]  It's not an original root language.
[02:32:20.865 --> 02:32:31.247]  It is, it has all these roots in it to basically, and you look at the Finns, they've even got Asian roots in their language, and there's even some of that in there.
[02:32:31.847 --> 02:32:35.128]  There's a couple of the Scandinavian countries that actually have Asian roots to their language.
[02:32:35.148 --> 02:32:38.389]  It's just absolutely documented, but that all gets off into that whole area.
[02:32:38.409 --> 02:32:39.089]  It's very interesting.
[02:32:40.509 --> 02:32:49.231]  So the British were a naval power, and they'd already dominated much of the world by 1815, and then they got all the Rothschild power behind them, and it was just over.
[02:32:51.172 --> 02:32:57.534]  And they're experts at controlling and dominating through front groups every other major institution and organization.
[02:32:58.834 --> 02:33:05.257]  But to just say that it's British ruling the world, no, it's British allied with the Dutch and the Germans and the Italians.
[02:33:05.777 --> 02:33:07.377]  I mean, Napoleon was Italian.
[02:33:08.758 --> 02:33:12.779]  So many other people think Christopher Columbus was Spanish or Portuguese.
[02:33:12.819 --> 02:33:13.619]  No, he was Italian.
[02:33:14.079 --> 02:33:18.861]  Italians had really, in the Western world, developed the art of statecraft first.
[02:33:19.571 --> 02:33:21.593]  And really brought it to a high science.
[02:33:22.293 --> 02:33:26.957]  And so it was just kind of like, it was a huge war game for a thousand years with all these groups fighting with each other.
[02:33:27.898 --> 02:33:32.321]  And it's geopolitical systems.
[02:33:33.462 --> 02:33:39.888]  And absolutely, I mean, religion is a powerful tool of control.
[02:33:40.848 --> 02:33:42.610]  So you're going to get corrupt, powerful people.
[02:33:43.430 --> 02:33:55.540]  We're going to want to infiltrate and control or steer Catholicism, Protestantism, all of the major Christian faiths to just a massive degree.
[02:33:57.201 --> 02:34:10.912]  And there is British Royal Israelism or British Israelism, and that's where then the Christian identity folks in this country didn't think they just made this up or found this in the Bible a few days ago.
[02:34:13.105 --> 02:34:28.711]  Actually, the British have been saying this for a thousand years, and it's been codified in their rituals of ascension to coronation in royalty for more than 300, I said 300, it's more like 500.
[02:34:30.872 --> 02:34:34.394]  Every British monarch's been sworn in for over 300 years on that stone.
[02:34:38.015 --> 02:34:42.337]  And so yes, I have researched this, I have looked at it, and in a weird way there's even truth to it.
[02:34:44.458 --> 02:34:51.703]  Because they thought that, well, like Jones, the name is from the son of Jonas.
[02:34:53.404 --> 02:35:00.089]  And they thought that that had been adopted when William the Conqueror came in 800 years ago, a Norman.
[02:35:00.949 --> 02:35:10.636]  But then they found on stones all over Europe and all over Wales and all over England and Scotland and Ireland, ancient Hebrew.
[02:35:12.020 --> 02:35:17.164]  And then what the anthropologists have now discovered is that the Vikings weren't here in 1200.
[02:35:18.104 --> 02:35:22.107]  The Vikings were in the New World 5,000 years ago.
[02:35:23.308 --> 02:35:24.208]  And they've dug them up.
[02:35:25.409 --> 02:35:27.250]  And it's in mainstream universities.
[02:35:27.430 --> 02:35:28.851]  But again, it's not on the nightly news.
[02:35:29.652 --> 02:35:36.757]  And that there are Arab accounts, you know, 1,800 years old with Vikings in the Mediterranean.
[02:35:36.777 --> 02:35:40.219]  But they call them, you know, the Northmen, the Norse, trading with them.
[02:35:41.568 --> 02:35:49.395]  Uh, so the truth is that they have found Chinese characters, Chinese symbols, and I've been there in Tulum and Chichen Itza.
[02:35:49.775 --> 02:35:52.037]  They have found jade that they can test that's 100% from Central Asia.
[02:35:54.453 --> 02:35:56.275]  We're good to go.
[02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:37.888]  In the 1490s, under the Queen of Spain, Isabella, funding it, Christopher Columbus, or Colombo, in the Italian, he popularized and showed that it was profitable in tobacco, slaves, and gold.
[02:36:37.948 --> 02:36:41.250]  But it was known that it was there.
[02:36:45.052 --> 02:36:52.096]  But to then extrapolate out and say that the British are behind Christian fundamentalists, England has almost extincted Christianity.
[02:36:53.433 --> 02:36:58.254]  I mean, you go to a Baptist church on Sunday, there's almost no one there.
[02:36:58.654 --> 02:37:01.095]  Over 90% of Britons say they're non-religious now.
[02:37:01.535 --> 02:37:03.395]  You go to the Catholic churches, nobody's there.
[02:37:04.735 --> 02:37:08.296]  So, do governments manipulate Christian fundamentalists?
[02:37:08.336 --> 02:37:08.876]  Have they been?
[02:37:08.916 --> 02:37:13.177]  Well, we've got documents that have come out on that, and major televangelists being paid millions of dollars by Israel.
[02:37:14.537 --> 02:37:17.078]  But they're also busy out trying to fund other groups, too.
[02:37:18.044 --> 02:37:21.066]  So I said I'd take calls, and I'm already digressing for five, six minutes on this.
[02:37:21.207 --> 02:37:22.688]  It's just, I've studied that history.
[02:37:23.348 --> 02:37:26.010]  It is absolutely incredible and very interesting.
[02:37:28.112 --> 02:37:41.903]  I was, this weekend, I didn't have much time, but I did read about 50 pages of a, um... That one was only about a thousand year old Arab manuscript translated into English about 200 years ago.
[02:37:41.923 --> 02:37:45.946]  And I was reading that about travels to Britannia,
[02:37:46.986 --> 02:37:53.390]  Travels to, trading, going into Turkey, meeting up, it's just amazing.
[02:37:55.111 --> 02:37:56.972]  Absolute, going up to the steps of Russia.
[02:37:59.293 --> 02:38:01.314]  The Dark Ages destroyed a lot of that.
[02:38:02.775 --> 02:38:05.977]  And now we're just now learning about all these things that happened.
[02:38:08.058 --> 02:38:12.920]  And, I mean, like the term Aryan, well that's what Iranian means.
[02:38:13.201 --> 02:38:15.582]  Iran means that in Persian.
[02:38:16.232 --> 02:38:17.353]  I mean, that's an encyclopedia.
[02:38:17.493 --> 02:38:18.313]  That's the fact.
[02:38:18.414 --> 02:38:19.955]  I'm not telling you something that's speculative.
[02:38:23.357 --> 02:38:28.260]  Because before they got conquered by the folks that are in Iraq today, they were blonde-haired, blue-eyed.
[02:38:29.761 --> 02:38:44.451]  And then you had major migrations out of North Africa, major migrations also out of India and the East, conquering many times the populations of Central Asia into the Middle East, into Europe.
[02:38:45.327 --> 02:38:52.370]  But you also had other influxes of Anglo, and they dug their graves up everywhere.
[02:38:52.390 --> 02:38:56.511]  I mean, they dig mummies up that have got, you know, blonde hair, into China.
[02:38:57.192 --> 02:39:02.194]  So there's just all this continual... That's the government's problem with race-specific bioweapons.
[02:39:02.214 --> 02:39:09.717]  They've tried to make race-specific bioweapons that will kill Asians, but almost all whites have Asian in them.
[02:39:10.597 --> 02:39:11.858]  Native Americans are Asian.
[02:39:12.038 --> 02:39:12.818]  Most of them don't even know it.
[02:39:15.971 --> 02:39:23.873]  But they've done blood tests, and they've dug up dead Native Americans from their bone marrow and DNA, and they have found Norse bloodlines in those Indians.
[02:39:24.453 --> 02:39:30.375]  Because those Indians came across the Bering Strait out of, uh, what is Siberia, and they ran in and intermarried.
[02:39:30.395 --> 02:39:31.795]  A lot of times they were killing each other.
[02:39:32.595 --> 02:39:34.536]  But Scandinavian tribes.
[02:39:34.936 --> 02:39:38.937]  That's why the Finns have a Asian language.
[02:39:40.678 --> 02:39:41.778]  It's Asian in its root.
[02:39:42.858 --> 02:39:44.339]  I mean, go look into it.
[02:39:44.379 --> 02:39:45.639]  Two other Norse groups have that.
[02:39:46.864 --> 02:39:50.726]  And that's why a lot of your Finns and a lot of your Russians have slant eyes.
[02:39:51.766 --> 02:39:55.088]  I have slant eyes if you really look at me.
[02:39:56.248 --> 02:40:01.590]  Because I've got Comanche and Cherokee a little bit in me.
[02:40:02.551 --> 02:40:12.675]  But you can go to England and find people who have supposedly no history of intermarrying with Native Americans and they're going to find slant eyes in people with blonde hair and blue eyes.
[02:40:13.669 --> 02:40:15.169]  You're going to find slant eyes, folks.
[02:40:15.189 --> 02:40:18.650]  That's a Mongolian feature.
[02:40:19.890 --> 02:40:21.831]  The Mongol hordes went all over Europe.
[02:40:24.671 --> 02:40:26.472]  Alright, now I'm really getting into history lessons here.
[02:40:26.512 --> 02:40:29.693]  It's all unbelievably captivating and interesting.
[02:40:29.733 --> 02:40:31.633]  I suggest you look into it to know your roots.
[02:40:34.934 --> 02:40:35.354]  Okay.
[02:40:37.294 --> 02:40:38.214]  Let's just blitz through these.
[02:40:38.254 --> 02:40:39.315]  I said I'd do it in the morning.
[02:40:39.655 --> 02:40:40.355]  Who's up next year?
[02:40:42.884 --> 02:40:43.705]  Peter's in New York.
[02:40:43.725 --> 02:40:44.126]  You're on the air.
[02:40:44.146 --> 02:40:44.446]  Go ahead.
[02:40:45.647 --> 02:40:46.108]  Hi Alex.
[02:40:46.348 --> 02:40:47.750]  I have two statements and a question.
[02:40:47.770 --> 02:40:49.131]  Firstly being about Endgame.
[02:40:49.632 --> 02:40:51.354]  What a fantastic documentary.
[02:40:51.674 --> 02:40:54.578]  It's just the best I've ever seen and by far your best work yet.
[02:40:55.875 --> 02:40:58.978]  Number two, people, we need to get this out now.
[02:40:59.238 --> 02:41:04.983]  Go to Google, type in Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement Stage 6.
[02:41:05.664 --> 02:41:06.264]  Download it.
[02:41:06.545 --> 02:41:07.405]  Download Nero.
[02:41:07.806 --> 02:41:08.586]  Burn it to CD.
[02:41:08.726 --> 02:41:12.390]  That should take you 25 minutes to an hour if you have a fast computer.
[02:41:12.750 --> 02:41:13.611]  Depends on the speed.
[02:41:14.331 --> 02:41:16.593]  Then after that's done, get Clone DVD.
[02:41:16.934 --> 02:41:18.655]  That should take you five minutes of DVD.
[02:41:18.935 --> 02:41:19.936]  Get this out to people.
[02:41:20.256 --> 02:41:21.137]  Now for my question.
[02:41:21.197 --> 02:41:22.038]  It's about Ron Paul.
[02:41:23.775 --> 02:41:33.418]  He says that if he wins he's going to abolish the Federal Reserve, and he's against the North American Union, so he's against the Amaro, and I guess against the Federal Reserve note.
[02:41:33.698 --> 02:41:35.639]  If he wins, what will then be our currency?
[02:41:35.839 --> 02:41:37.319]  I'll take the answer off the air.
[02:41:37.359 --> 02:41:37.699]  Thank you.
[02:41:38.120 --> 02:41:51.004]  Well, again, Ron Paul has put out his legislation, he's put out his plan, a lot of top economists have looked at it, and it's to phase out the Federal Reserve and phase us on to a gold-backed currency and U.S.
[02:41:51.044 --> 02:41:52.024]  greenbacks issued.
[02:41:53.935 --> 02:41:55.716]  And that's a very long subject.
[02:41:55.816 --> 02:41:58.776]  As for Endgame being on Google Video, look, it's up there.
[02:41:58.836 --> 02:42:00.117]  I haven't told anybody to take it down.
[02:42:00.877 --> 02:42:03.818]  But if I don't sell enough Endgames, I won't be able to make films in the future.
[02:42:03.878 --> 02:42:05.458]  Plus, it looks horrible on.
[02:42:05.698 --> 02:42:06.919]  And it's such an important work.
[02:42:07.759 --> 02:42:09.519]  It was like number 7 on Google yesterday.
[02:42:09.539 --> 02:42:10.580]  Number 1 all over the world.
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:12.000]  For some reason, 7 in the U.S.
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:13.601]  And they wouldn't let me click on it last night.
[02:42:14.101 --> 02:42:15.681]  And yeah, you can watch it at Google Video.
[02:42:15.701 --> 02:42:16.461]  You can watch Endgame.
[02:42:17.822 --> 02:42:21.643]  The bigger issue here is, do you want me to be able to make films?
[02:42:22.811 --> 02:42:31.158]  And, B, if you're going to go rip copies of Endgame, I've designed it so you can do it at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:42:32.819 --> 02:42:38.664]  And you go there, and you can download it in quality that is almost as good as DVD.
[02:42:38.704 --> 02:42:41.986]  I mean, I just marvel at the high-res versions up there.
[02:42:42.006 --> 02:42:46.370]  If you focus real close and look real close, you might see a little grain here or there.
[02:42:46.890 --> 02:42:50.993]  I mean, it looks like broadcast color television, you know, when you've got a really clean signal.
[02:42:51.013 --> 02:42:51.814]  I mean, it is clear.
[02:42:53.304 --> 02:42:53.845]  15 cents a day, $5.95.
[02:42:55.526 --> 02:42:58.668]  Go in there, download it to your computer, and it's easy to burn on disk.
[02:43:00.529 --> 02:43:01.249]  And do whatever you have to.
[02:43:01.269 --> 02:43:02.350]  Find a neighbor that knows how to do it.
[02:43:02.370 --> 02:43:04.712]  It's real easy, but if you don't know how, find out, do it.
[02:43:05.192 --> 02:43:06.453]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:43:06.493 --> 02:43:08.234]  We didn't make it where you can't get it.
[02:43:09.235 --> 02:43:12.196]  We didn't make it where you couldn't make copies from it.
[02:43:15.378 --> 02:43:20.041]  So, I mean, if you're going to make copies, make it from the quality of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:43:22.541 --> 02:43:50.204]  Or make it even better from the DVD itself, the DVD-9, in the highest quality, double-layer disc, what we're shipping out of here, the best there is, InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139, order right now, 888-253-3139, or go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a monthly trial membership, and TerrorStorm Special Edition, I mean, it's all up there, hundreds and hundreds of my TV reports, special reports,
[02:43:51.318 --> 02:43:52.838]  Extras that I never put in films.
[02:43:52.999 --> 02:43:54.239]  Thousands of pieces of media.
[02:43:54.619 --> 02:43:55.779]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:43:55.799 --> 02:43:59.400]  And by the way, it's not on Google Video right now.
[02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:01.121]  It's only going to be right now.
[02:44:01.141 --> 02:44:04.122]  It just went up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:44:04.282 --> 02:44:06.322]  And PrisonPlanet.tv is the main source.
[02:44:07.123 --> 02:44:15.085]  The 40 minutes of extras with the Battle for the Republic piece that I put in the film.
[02:44:17.535 --> 02:44:20.076]  That's in the extras about the illegal immigration and all that.
[02:44:20.116 --> 02:44:24.478]  A great 18-minute mini-film that will wake people up all day long and all night.
[02:44:24.578 --> 02:44:25.419]  It's so important.
[02:44:25.939 --> 02:44:36.524]  So go to PrisonPlanet.tv right now and get your membership if you haven't or members that are there and download the extras right now and make copies and get them out to people or get the DVD and it has the extras on it as well.
[02:44:36.804 --> 02:44:37.805]  Now I've got to really move fast.
[02:44:38.665 --> 02:44:39.906]  Charlie in Texas, go ahead.
[02:44:39.926 --> 02:44:40.866]  Hello.
[02:44:41.226 --> 02:44:41.406]  Hi.
[02:44:43.604 --> 02:44:44.784]  Very interesting stuff.
[02:44:44.804 --> 02:44:47.825]  A couple of days ago, my daughter called me all upset.
[02:44:47.845 --> 02:44:49.406]  She was driving north on 183.
[02:44:50.066 --> 02:44:51.907]  All of a sudden, she was on a toll road.
[02:44:52.447 --> 02:44:54.928]  I was on North Mopac a couple of days ago.
[02:44:54.988 --> 02:44:57.148]  Got off at an exit just north of Palmer.
[02:44:57.648 --> 02:45:02.650]  There was a sign added to the exit sign that said, Last Free Exit.
[02:45:03.633 --> 02:45:05.454]  We can't stop these people.
[02:45:06.274 --> 02:45:13.177]  I recall... And remember, one year ago, they said, we're all conspiracy theorists, no plans to put tolls there.
[02:45:13.517 --> 02:45:17.179]  And then two weeks ago, as they were putting the toll booths in, they said, you know what?
[02:45:17.599 --> 02:45:18.499]  We're putting them in.
[02:45:19.300 --> 02:45:20.060]  I mean, I know.
[02:45:20.140 --> 02:45:21.500]  It's like there's no NAU.
[02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:23.461]  There's no way to stop them.
[02:45:23.601 --> 02:45:32.485]  A few weeks ago, you were talking on your program, I think, about a large sum of money, maybe tens of billions, put into a bank account.
[02:45:33.007 --> 02:45:35.409]  Taken from the taxpayers, just sitting there.
[02:45:35.589 --> 02:45:35.849]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:35.889 --> 02:45:37.009]  Where is this thing?
[02:45:37.070 --> 02:45:38.190]  Who administers it?
[02:45:38.230 --> 02:45:38.991]  What's the number?
[02:45:39.051 --> 02:45:42.053]  I mean, are we not sovereign citizens?
[02:45:42.113 --> 02:45:43.273]  No, we were taken over.
[02:45:43.293 --> 02:45:45.375]  Let's go make a citizen's arrest!
[02:45:46.235 --> 02:45:53.099]  Let's pop the evidence down, get some honest peace officers to help us, and let's charge them with a crime!
[02:45:53.139 --> 02:45:57.142]  Well, we've got to first convince those officers this is going on, and they need to check it out for themselves.
[02:45:57.182 --> 02:45:59.083]  I appreciate your call, and I understand your passion.
[02:45:59.823 --> 02:46:02.405]  They're called Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports.
[02:46:03.442 --> 02:46:04.543]  And lawyers are slick.
[02:46:05.563 --> 02:46:19.089]  And at the end of World War II, they got the National Association of Counties, National Association of Cities, National Association of Governors to all these dozens and dozens of big lavish dinners in the Caribbean and New York at five-star hotels and steak dinners three times a day.
[02:46:19.129 --> 02:46:19.849]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[02:46:20.189 --> 02:46:20.810]  All paid for.
[02:46:21.370 --> 02:46:23.391]  And they said, listen, we're going to pay you a cut of this.
[02:46:24.371 --> 02:46:29.473]  And they had the Federal Reserve's backing and governors and people there saying this is all legit.
[02:46:29.534 --> 02:46:30.534]  We're going to take
[02:46:31.152 --> 02:46:36.639]  The majority of the tax money and invest it in private funds that the city managers and governors and others will control.
[02:46:37.240 --> 02:46:45.170]  After you're in office 5-10 years, you rotate in to the corporations you made investments in and you're paid hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases, usually just millions.
[02:46:46.583 --> 02:46:51.225]  And, uh, water districts, small water districts on average have 10, 20, 30 million.
[02:46:51.285 --> 02:46:53.686]  Small school districts, hundreds of millions apiece.
[02:46:54.206 --> 02:46:57.308]  There are hundreds of thousands of governmental institutions.
[02:46:57.848 --> 02:46:59.688]  They've been taking all the money since 1950.
[02:46:59.849 --> 02:47:01.709]  It went nationwide in 53.
[02:47:02.490 --> 02:47:08.512]  Started with the Chicago 1313 model, and just the mafia took over with lawyers, and they took all the money and invested it.
[02:47:08.572 --> 02:47:12.974]  Now, almost 80% of all the money is invested.
[02:47:14.315 --> 02:47:21.478]  All the tax money, not for pensions, not for... No, this is off-record, off-budget, and it's called the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports.
[02:47:21.538 --> 02:47:22.459]  It's totally public.
[02:47:23.839 --> 02:47:26.841]  It's like that the hijackers were trained at U.S.
[02:47:26.861 --> 02:47:32.123]  bases is public, mainstream news, but no one seems to care and notice, because one-fifth of the country can't find the U.S.
[02:47:32.183 --> 02:47:32.563]  on a map.
[02:47:33.183 --> 02:47:35.525]  Eighty percent plus can't tell you who the Vice President is.
[02:47:36.285 --> 02:47:43.048]  Sir, when the public becomes absolute mindless idiots by design to the educational system, plus the milk and honey of a successful society, we got lazy.
[02:47:44.289 --> 02:47:44.889]  Jigs up!
[02:47:45.990 --> 02:47:49.651]  Jigs up at that point, and now they don't even need it.
[02:47:49.671 --> 02:47:52.852]  The 20% of the wealth is left in our hands, and they're just busy taking that right now.
[02:47:54.292 --> 02:47:56.032]  See, they didn't have full control before.
[02:47:56.052 --> 02:47:57.113]  Now they're getting it.
[02:47:57.173 --> 02:47:58.393]  People say, well, why didn't they do this before?
[02:47:58.673 --> 02:48:00.034]  They're getting the control.
[02:48:01.354 --> 02:48:08.096]  And let me tell you, any finance guy, any person living in one of these $10 million houses, they know all about the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports.
[02:48:09.378 --> 02:48:15.461]  And I've had city managers in here, even quote, good guys, you bring that up to them, they turn red and start smiling and start blushing.
[02:48:16.521 --> 02:48:18.202]  It's the big enchilada.
[02:48:19.383 --> 02:48:24.565]  And I made a film, Walter Berrien, titled, Annual Comprehensive Financial Reports Exposed.
[02:48:24.585 --> 02:48:29.688]  You can get it at nfoawards.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:48:29.728 --> 02:48:31.288]  Understander, you can watch it on Google Video.
[02:48:32.369 --> 02:48:35.971]  So, we'll be right back, and I may have time to jam in a couple more calls.
[02:48:35.991 --> 02:48:36.731]  We'll see, stay with us.
[02:48:45.839 --> 02:48:47.240]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:47.260 --> 02:48:49.362]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.083 --> 02:48:54.326]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:54.967 --> 02:48:56.729]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:48:57.549 --> 02:49:00.052]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[02:49:00.592 --> 02:49:03.054]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:03.775 --> 02:49:11.141]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.105 --> 02:49:19.108]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:19.588 --> 02:49:23.090]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:23.431 --> 02:49:25.932]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[02:49:25.992 --> 02:49:27.133]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.173 --> 02:49:27.933]  They're not after money.
[02:49:27.953 --> 02:49:29.014]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.234 --> 02:49:29.654]  They're after power.
[02:49:29.674 --> 02:49:30.895]  That's what they're after, you see.
[02:49:31.375 --> 02:49:35.898]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:52:07.274 --> 02:52:08.355]  I thought he had it up 10 minutes ago.
[02:52:08.415 --> 02:52:09.356]  It's going up right now.
[02:52:10.220 --> 02:52:18.931]  With the trailer from YouTube of it and of course for members of PrisonPlanet.TV the whole thing that's going on right now at PrisonPlanet.com.

[02:53:09.134 --> 02:53:13.015]  Sixty-something hours of audio, a big, thick book, all these e-books.
[02:53:13.055 --> 02:53:14.035]  It's just a great package.
[02:53:14.075 --> 02:53:14.996]  I couldn't even go through it all.
[02:53:15.016 --> 02:53:15.996]  It's just great material.
[02:53:16.016 --> 02:53:16.936]  877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, or out in 90.com.
[02:53:16.956 --> 02:53:18.517]  We have banners up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:53:27.859 --> 02:53:28.339]  As well.
[02:53:28.459 --> 02:53:31.820]  Again, in-game extras, which are just as powerful as the film.
[02:53:31.840 --> 02:53:35.522]  These are sections of the film that we just couldn't put in because we couldn't have the film be three hours long.
[02:53:36.022 --> 02:53:39.643]  Go on up on the website right now and help us get the story polls written about it out.
[02:53:39.863 --> 02:53:40.703]  Powerful info.
[02:53:41.224 --> 02:53:43.444]  And get that YouTube clip out, the five minutes of it.
[02:53:43.584 --> 02:53:44.865]  Even if you're not a member, you can watch that.
[02:53:45.725 --> 02:53:49.366]  Let's talk to Derek in Canada.
[02:53:49.386 --> 02:53:49.946]  Thanks for holding.
[02:53:49.986 --> 02:53:51.127]  I think you may be our tail gunner.
[02:53:51.167 --> 02:53:51.447]  Go ahead.
[02:53:52.366 --> 02:53:53.066]  Thank you very much.
[02:53:53.626 --> 02:54:07.611]  I used to work for a rather large communications company here in Canada, and I was fired for saying that man-generated CO2 does not cause global warming, as was another of my co-workers for reiterating it.
[02:54:08.311 --> 02:54:13.253]  And this was in regards to Al Gore's propaganda film, An Inconvenient Truth.
[02:54:13.313 --> 02:54:15.534]  And your country's adopting that and they're now telling U.S.
[02:54:15.574 --> 02:54:20.756]  power plants they have to shut down or can't build because CO2's a deadly poison when it's what plants breathe.
[02:54:20.836 --> 02:54:21.836]  It's a total fraud.
[02:54:23.101 --> 02:54:23.622]  Completely.
[02:54:23.682 --> 02:54:24.542]  I agree with you 110%.
[02:54:24.862 --> 02:54:25.863]  It's a life tax.
[02:54:25.923 --> 02:54:26.503]  They know that.
[02:54:26.904 --> 02:54:28.805]  It's what animals exhale.
[02:54:28.825 --> 02:54:30.506]  Go ahead.
[02:54:30.646 --> 02:54:45.356]  Anyway, I just want to let your listeners know, if they see all gore of any of the supporters, to point out how much of a hypocrite he is, the guy flies around the world in a private jet, owns like five SUVs and lives in a monstrosity of a man.
[02:54:45.396 --> 02:54:46.017]  What is that?
[02:54:46.077 --> 02:54:47.718]  I think it's a 10,000 square foot house.
[02:54:49.167 --> 02:54:51.448]  Yeah, and this guy thinks he has the right to dictate to me.
[02:54:51.509 --> 02:54:53.070]  Look, it's about a global tax.
[02:54:53.130 --> 02:54:55.951]  He's a total criminal New World Order scum liar.
[02:54:56.712 --> 02:55:00.734]  And again, toxic waste, genetic engineering, burn down the rainforest, that's fine.
[02:55:01.035 --> 02:55:03.676]  But let's put taxes on all CO2 emissions.
[02:55:03.756 --> 02:55:04.917]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:55:05.537 --> 02:55:07.619]  Yeah, he's a blue-blood little weasel.
[02:55:07.779 --> 02:55:08.579]  I despise him.
[02:55:08.599 --> 02:55:10.761]  Well, you ought to write an article about where you got fired from.
[02:55:10.781 --> 02:55:11.601]  Where'd you get fired from?
[02:55:12.042 --> 02:55:13.202]  Rogers Communications.
[02:55:14.043 --> 02:55:14.683]  Why did they fire you?
[02:55:14.703 --> 02:55:15.804]  You said that was a thought-crimer.
[02:55:16.934 --> 02:55:21.459]  No, it was in relation to an inquiry made by a customer.
[02:55:21.539 --> 02:55:24.262]  You know, why are you sending out all this junk mail when...
[02:55:25.253 --> 02:55:26.394]  We already have your services.
[02:55:26.414 --> 02:55:29.394]  And I just politely stated that, you know, thanks for the feedback.
[02:55:29.414 --> 02:55:32.215]  I'll forward it to the corresponding department for review.
[02:55:33.036 --> 02:55:37.417]  But just bear in mind that we can't base marketing initiatives off of what Al Gores says in the movie.
[02:55:38.137 --> 02:55:40.158]  And somebody blogged it or something.
[02:55:40.178 --> 02:55:42.599]  A bunch of pseudo-environmentalist types.
[02:55:43.099 --> 02:55:45.760]  And rather than... Yeah, they want to control the mode of production.
[02:55:45.780 --> 02:55:47.140]  They want to make us their slaves.
[02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:49.661]  This is about government controlling what industry's left.
[02:55:50.268 --> 02:55:53.190]  Well, the big industry finances it to shut down their competition.
[02:55:53.270 --> 02:55:54.211]  Red-level crisis.
[02:55:54.511 --> 02:55:55.712]  It's all covered in Endgame.
[02:55:55.972 --> 02:55:57.133]  Blue Pen for Global Enslaved.
[02:55:57.193 --> 02:55:57.954]  And I salute you.
[02:55:58.234 --> 02:55:59.155]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:55:59.535 --> 02:56:01.717]  Folks, Endgame extras are now out.
[02:56:01.757 --> 02:56:03.378]  They're now on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:03.898 --> 02:56:04.659]  I just refreshed.
[02:56:04.679 --> 02:56:05.279]  They're up there.
[02:56:05.620 --> 02:56:06.040]  Go there.
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:06.460]  See it.
[02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:07.001]  Check it out.
[02:56:07.481 --> 02:56:16.189]  If you missed any of the first hour, I got into really key info on new Al-Qaeda developments right when the show started, so you can go to InfoWars.com and listen to the restreams there.
[02:56:16.229 --> 02:56:21.033]  We repeat the show 24 hours a day right here on my website, InfoWars.com.
[02:56:21.353 --> 02:56:22.214]  God bless you all.
[02:56:22.234 --> 02:56:24.236]  See you back live tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central.
[02:56:25.537 --> 02:56:30.181]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
