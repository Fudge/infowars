[00:00:01.136 --> 00:00:06.718]  Prepare your time machine for a talk radio that can carry you to sleep like no other.
[00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:09.059]  You can strap this all in.
[00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:09.739]  Hold on.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.060]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:15.041]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:15.142 --> 00:00:18.243]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:19.143 --> 00:00:21.464]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:24.325]  Call Alex now, toll free.
[00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:29.659]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.591]  We're here every Sunday live from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:48.472]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:48.492 --> 00:01:00.698]  I want to thank all of our affiliates on the AM and FM dial, our satellite listeners, our listeners at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and the WWCR Global Satellite listeners as well for tuning in.
[00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:03.160]  We are here again every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.181]  on the live radio six days a week, Monday through Friday.
[00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:07.002]  We take off Saturday
[00:01:08.064 --> 00:01:11.207]  And then we're here back in the saddle on Sundays.
[00:01:11.227 --> 00:01:13.629]  We'll have open phones today, no guests today.
[00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.432]  We have a lot of important news and information to cover.
[00:01:17.713 --> 00:01:22.357]  President Bush and his handlers are preparing to remove the last obstacle.
[00:01:23.328 --> 00:01:23.588]  I think?
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.700]  We're good to go.
[00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:02.847]  Very, very serious news.
[00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:10.351]  Headline, London Telegraph today, Terror label paves way for airstrikes Sunday, August 26, 2007.
[00:02:11.892 --> 00:02:16.855]  Later in the broadcast, I'm going to spend at least 10 minutes eulogizing a good friend of mine.
[00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:24.520]  I felt like I knew him well personally from countless radio interviews, but I didn't even get a chance to meet him in person.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.481]  Both of us lead very busy lives.
[00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:27.182]  I don't know.
[00:02:45.638 --> 00:03:04.253]  Uh... film producer, patriot, gubernatorial and presidential candidate, good friend of mine, Aaron Russo died in the pre-dawn hours at about four in the morning out in California at the hospital and it was picked up by several California newspapers.
[00:03:04.313 --> 00:03:07.136]  You can simply Google the name Aaron Russo and find out the details.
[00:03:07.456 --> 00:03:14.562]  We have eulogized him on prisonplanet.com with several little articles that we put out that I wrote up and we also
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.481]  I've got some things to say and some
[00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:42.785]  We're good to go.
[00:04:12.548 --> 00:04:12.828]  Later.
[00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:23.615]  Also in the stacks, I'm sure that listeners are going to want to talk about the History Channel hit piece that has aired now three times in the last week.
[00:04:23.635 --> 00:04:32.800]  It's going to be airing again tonight, and generally these type of special programs, we've done a look at it, I've talked to the producer of it.
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.503]  It'll probably air 15 times by the end of the year, another 15 times next year.
[00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:53.347]  A two-hour hit piece, a carpet, a woven structure of lies so monumental, so massive, that it really even boggles the mind to try to even address it.
[00:04:54.748 --> 00:04:57.029]  I am the central devil in the production.
[00:04:57.049 --> 00:05:06.233]  It begins with my great evil and ends with me as this abomination who's hurting the families.
[00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:31.633]  Of course they don't tell you that we've interviewed literally hundreds of victims and hundreds of family members, hundreds, I've done hundreds and hundreds of interviews, sometimes five, six or more of the victims, people who were actually firemen, police, survivors, or widows, or widowers, daughters, sons, grandmothers, brothers, sisters, girlfriends, on my radio show.
[00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:36.396]  And I've done many sit-down interviews in New York and other areas of the country.
[00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:40.473]  And we tried to supply these individuals to the show.
[00:05:40.493 --> 00:05:42.134]  They didn't want to talk to them.
[00:05:42.514 --> 00:05:48.115]  We tried to supply them to the BBC hit piece that was very similar, but failed in comparison to the scope.
[00:05:48.156 --> 00:05:50.456]  I guess when you've got two hours, it can be far worse.
[00:05:50.896 --> 00:05:53.777]  About an hour and a half broadcast time, transmission time.
[00:05:54.618 --> 00:06:01.740]  And then, of course, they ignored Bill Doyle, the head of the Biggest Victims Family Group.
[00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:02.921]  I don't know.
[00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:28.120]  The majority believe it's a total inside job that is carried out by criminal elements of the government.
[00:06:28.781 --> 00:06:37.284]  History Channel basically says all of the victims and all of their families believe what Bush said and what the government said and that basically I am Satan.
[00:06:38.104 --> 00:06:41.266]  Two hour special airing over and over and over again.
[00:06:45.007 --> 00:06:47.428]  Frankly, I wish that I was the bad guy in all of this.
[00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:57.834]  I wish that this stuff wasn't true, and frankly, I wish I wasn't being demonized on national television.
[00:06:58.315 --> 00:07:05.339]  When I got started in this stuff 12 or 13 years ago, it was fun to have local TV interview me, and it was fun to have somebody say hi to me on the street.
[00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:12.383]  That novelty wore off a long time ago, and basically, I'm at the point of return.
[00:07:12.904 --> 00:07:14.985]  I just can't turn back in the work I've done.
[00:07:15.982 --> 00:07:19.224]  And this is what I do.
[00:07:19.724 --> 00:07:21.405]  The evidence is conclusive.
[00:07:21.505 --> 00:07:23.186]  I wish to God every day it wasn't.
[00:07:24.146 --> 00:07:30.790]  And it is freakish to know that the general public has absolutely no idea.
[00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.332]  In fact, I have an AP article here that just came out a few days ago.
[00:07:35.352 --> 00:07:40.135]  And it's, excuse me, this is an agency, French Press.
[00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:44.520]  And it says, but AP also covered the survey, two-thirds of U.S.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:50.721]  adults admit to being in the dark about political issues outside of the United States, and only a third are well-versed in U.S.
[00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.982]  politics, the result of a poll published shows.
[00:07:53.022 --> 00:08:08.526]  And it goes on to say that only 14% of men say that they are knowledgeable on world politics, with only 3% of women saying they're knowledgeable, and saying they just don't care, or they just don't know.
[00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:18.569]  And believe me, when both the House and Senate heads of the Armed Services Committees on television, they've asked them, what's a Sunni, what's a Shiite?
[00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:22.211]  And they go, well, the Shiite's Al-Qaeda, and the Sunni fights them.
[00:08:24.532 --> 00:08:28.414]  Now, again, folks, Shiites are different.
[00:08:28.894 --> 00:08:29.755]  They're the opposite.
[00:08:30.753 --> 00:08:38.318]  Of the sect of Islam that the supposed Al Qaeda comes from, even if you believe that bogeyman made up fraud.
[00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:40.660]  And I know I talk about this all the time, it's just one example.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.464]  I mean, we're trying to talk to a general public who literally has no idea about how anything works now.
[00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:55.170]  And to know that we've gone from the most informed, most educated, and most successful population in world history,
[00:08:56.078 --> 00:09:00.582]  Four percent of the world's population, half the wealth, 90 plus percent of all the patents.
[00:09:02.104 --> 00:09:04.606]  I mean, the Founding Fathers on average could speak four languages.
[00:09:05.187 --> 00:09:09.851]  They could, you know, Latin, Greek, it didn't matter, French.
[00:09:11.653 --> 00:09:19.000]  Now, again, I'm not even that smart, that's what blows me away, is that you can't even have serious discussions with people.
[00:09:21.463 --> 00:09:23.767]  And let me tell you what happens in history when you become dumbed down.
[00:09:24.148 --> 00:09:25.010]  You become enslaved.
[00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.713]  This was all engineered by design.
[00:09:27.574 --> 00:09:32.343]  And now, um, the bottom has fallen out a long time ago.
[00:09:33.525 --> 00:09:34.006]  And, uh...
[00:09:34.927 --> 00:09:36.488]  You're gonna get to enjoy tyranny, folks.
[00:09:36.508 --> 00:09:37.528]  You're gonna get to experience it.
[00:09:38.249 --> 00:09:49.173]  I'm here planting seeds, hoping that as we get deeper into this, you'll finally wake up and decide to get informed about liberty and freedom, as you are about Harley Davidsons and how to act cool and how to strut around, okay?
[00:09:49.494 --> 00:09:50.594]  And how to have big biceps.
[00:09:51.014 --> 00:09:52.155]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:52.615]  Stay with us.
[00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.772]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:10:07.112 --> 00:10:09.053]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:10:09.434 --> 00:10:17.118]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:17.778 --> 00:10:24.843]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:25.243 --> 00:10:28.145]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.886]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:10:31.306 --> 00:10:32.147]  NSA spying.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.762]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:10:36.942 --> 00:10:40.463]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:10:40.923 --> 00:10:42.844]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:47.106]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:13:01.684 --> 00:13:03.464]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:13:03.765 --> 00:13:06.605]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[00:13:07.105 --> 00:13:09.306]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[00:13:09.926 --> 00:13:18.208]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[00:13:18.688 --> 00:13:19.248]  An example?
[00:13:19.788 --> 00:13:22.609]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:26.270]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.911]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[00:13:30.686 --> 00:13:35.870]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.992]  Money is not the problem.
[00:13:38.212 --> 00:13:39.213]  Availability is.
[00:13:39.733 --> 00:13:41.594]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[00:13:41.835 --> 00:13:45.497]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[00:13:46.138 --> 00:13:48.219]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:49.280]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:49.340]  800-409-5633.
[00:14:03.015 --> 00:14:05.656]  You're listening to GCN.
[00:14:05.676 --> 00:14:10.118]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:15.020]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[00:14:15.801 --> 00:14:18.182]  You're locked in to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:19.042 --> 00:14:26.645]  Alright folks, I see we have loaded phone lines here.
[00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:27.546]  Your calls will be
[00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:31.136]  There's also a message board up on prisonplanet.com
[00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:51.349]  Yes, we're good to go.
[00:15:14.915 --> 00:15:22.562]  Also, there's some very interesting economic news on what's happening on the housing front and with the dollar right now and with interest rates being lowered last week.
[00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:34.014]  We'll be covering that as well, but really the top story today is something that developed last week and then into Monday and Tuesday of last week.
[00:15:35.649 --> 00:15:42.851]  Up in Montebello, right outside Ottawa, in the capital of Canada, they had the third annual Security and Prosperity Partnership meeting.
[00:15:43.391 --> 00:15:58.615]  Now this was set up in 2005, just north of me at the Crawford Ranch, between then President Vicente Fox of Mexico, and of course the Prime Minister of Canada, Mr. Howard, and our current President George Bush.
[00:15:59.015 --> 00:16:00.756]  And that agreement is still secret.
[00:16:02.677 --> 00:16:10.446]  But we were able by a FOIA request and lawsuits filed by Judicial Watch at the second annual secret meeting.
[00:16:10.466 --> 00:16:11.888]  Now, no one even knew the meeting was happening.
[00:16:12.634 --> 00:16:20.578]  And then local press up in Banff, beautiful area, out in the middle of nowhere at this big resort, said, why are there all these helicopters and troops and armed guards?
[00:16:21.158 --> 00:16:27.542]  Well, it was the leadership of all three countries met in secret, and then the lawsuits were filed, and we got the minutes.
[00:16:27.702 --> 00:16:31.204]  And it says, we're going to keep it secret, carbon tax, North American Union.
[00:16:31.484 --> 00:16:33.505]  I mean, it's all there in the document.
[00:16:34.686 --> 00:16:38.367]  And I'd just been there a few months before with the Bilderberg Group 2006 meeting that they had in Ottawa.
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:47.324]  So now they've got to be more public about it, so they have the third annual public summit, but public meaning there were a few press conferences.
[00:16:47.624 --> 00:17:00.210]  They had it on this private area, Montebello, surrounded there in this parkland, surrounded by the lake and the river, and people couldn't get in, and they had all these stormtroopers dressed
[00:17:01.148 --> 00:17:25.153]  uh... police uh... they spent uh... they reported uh... eight million dollars uh... on the police to or was it eighty million i forget it was in the i'll actually google that and pull that up and it was the customary black ski mask it was the customary darth vader outfits and the same thing that always happens since nineteen ninety nine in seattle where all this started
[00:17:25.948 --> 00:17:31.633]  The gear was issued all over North America, and now every time there was an event, the planes land.
[00:17:31.733 --> 00:17:34.636]  Off the planes get the black block anarchists.
[00:17:34.736 --> 00:17:37.158]  I've personally witnessed them do this.
[00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:40.501]  And they will go up, led by Special Forces U.S.
[00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:43.384]  troops, led by Delta Force in some cases.
[00:17:43.424 --> 00:17:46.046]  By the way, this has been in the Seattle newspapers, what you're hearing right now.
[00:17:46.306 --> 00:17:48.088]  It's in my film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:17:49.359 --> 00:18:04.424]  I mean you'll have six foot five guys who have like one percent body fat in anarchist outfits and they'll just be shoving people to the ground and throwing bottles at cops and the cops are ordered by their captains to stand down.
[00:18:05.493 --> 00:18:07.476]  And you learn that they're police.
[00:18:07.556 --> 00:18:10.120]  So before I tell you what happened, because this time they got caught.
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.384]  Now, we've always caught them, but the media has never admitted it.
[00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:15.167]  This is a CBC television.
[00:18:15.207 --> 00:18:19.613]  Quebec police admit they went undercover at Montebello protests.
[00:18:20.302 --> 00:18:24.846]  And it shows screenshots of the YouTube video that was shot of this.
[00:18:24.966 --> 00:18:29.851]  I have a Toronto Star where three days ago they were investigating provocateurs.
[00:18:29.971 --> 00:18:35.896]  Now the police have admitted that they were in there and we knew there were cops.
[00:18:36.257 --> 00:18:41.882]  I mean, one of these guys is like 6'6", giant arms, exactly what I saw in Austin at the Fortune 599.
[00:18:44.284 --> 00:18:45.726]  No one had resisted them.
[00:18:45.806 --> 00:18:46.686]  No one had done anything.
[00:18:46.727 --> 00:18:48.148]  So let me go back and tell you the story.
[00:18:48.368 --> 00:18:49.970]  We've aired this on my local cable show.
[00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.013]  I've literally got thousands of tapes, but we're digging it out.
[00:18:53.353 --> 00:18:56.616]  And we're going to put this on the web and show you because it's the same thing.
[00:18:57.057 --> 00:18:59.359]  And I show up to cover the demonstration.
[00:18:59.779 --> 00:18:59.879]  It's 99.
[00:19:01.938 --> 00:19:18.723]  They've got, it's right after Seattle, they've got hundreds and hundreds of police, had to be more than 500, lined up in Darth Vader outfits, black masks, black shields, over their faces, tear gas, clubs, shotguns, loaded with pepper spray.
[00:19:19.544 --> 00:19:20.444]  All of these weapons.
[00:19:21.084 --> 00:19:29.547]  And we show up, we're going to march from the Capitol, it's only about 300 protesters, 400 or so, and we're going to march down to the Four Seasons on the river,
[00:19:30.513 --> 00:19:58.147]  uh... where they are now ladybird johnson lake it's really a river but that shows they tell the yuppies it's a lake they believe it and that's what I mean realities out the window here just even basic terms but uh... not being mean just call it ladybird river or something but but again don't tell the yuppies that and so they want to believe or whatever let them drink the kool-aid uh... so all of a sudden I'm standing there with a video camera and I got Mike Hanson out there with me and and all of a sudden I see these huge guys
[00:19:59.631 --> 00:20:02.774]  One of them about 6'4", the other about 6'5", 6'6", I don't know, huge.
[00:20:03.315 --> 00:20:05.697]  And they're shoving people going, come on, let's fight!
[00:20:06.117 --> 00:20:12.023]  And I notice there's about 15 black block anarchists and they're like smiling at them and pulling their little masks down and winking.
[00:20:12.043 --> 00:20:14.725]  And I go, we got cops over here trying to start a riot.
[00:20:14.965 --> 00:20:16.006]  Cops, cops, cops.
[00:20:16.026 --> 00:20:23.313]  And all of a sudden the little anarchists saying, these are local anarchists who we know aren't cops, showing they all work together, walk up and start shoving me.
[00:20:23.593 --> 00:20:26.217]  And I'm like, see officers, see what your little minions are doing?
[00:20:26.237 --> 00:20:29.502]  There's people up on top of the bank buildings with video cameras.
[00:20:29.522 --> 00:20:30.964]  They've got binoculars watching us.
[00:20:31.184 --> 00:20:33.668]  And I say to this little red-haired anarchist, I say,
[00:20:34.881 --> 00:20:36.662]  Oh, that's your boss, who's up there in the building.
[00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:39.943]  And he goes... Now, understand, Mike's wandered off with the video camera.
[00:20:39.963 --> 00:20:41.323]  He's off videotaping, so I don't have this on tape.
[00:20:41.563 --> 00:20:46.945]  And he shoves me right in the chest, and he goes, Listen, we are taking over, and when we do, we're going to kill you!
[00:20:46.965 --> 00:20:47.865]  Do you understand?
[00:20:47.905 --> 00:20:48.525]  You're dead!
[00:20:49.146 --> 00:20:50.026]  Listen to me, Jones.
[00:20:50.326 --> 00:20:51.426]  Of course they're with us!
[00:20:51.906 --> 00:20:53.147]  And, I mean, this guy was scary.
[00:20:53.727 --> 00:21:01.033]  I mean, because he was like 30-something years old, he was leading the anarchists, and I mean, this was an undercover fed, and he was, that's right!
[00:21:01.313 --> 00:21:02.254]  And we're taking over!
[00:21:02.274 --> 00:21:03.695]  Right in the chest!
[00:21:03.735 --> 00:21:04.936]  Now you gonna do something, boy?
[00:21:05.776 --> 00:21:06.177]  Yeah!
[00:21:06.337 --> 00:21:07.678]  And I was like, whoa!
[00:21:07.998 --> 00:21:10.920]  Not only were these cops over, and then all of a sudden I run over and I go, that's it!
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.402]  There are cops instigating, I want them arrested!
[00:21:13.662 --> 00:21:16.204]  Twenty cops run across the street and go, back off, Jones, back off!
[00:21:16.445 --> 00:21:23.330]  And they go, we're gonna talk to these men, and they drag them off like they're gonna arrest them, and you see them, and then they insert two more cops, dressed the same.
[00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:27.777]  In black and bandanas and all this stuff, and I'm going, whoa!
[00:21:28.337 --> 00:21:37.781]  Okay, so not only have we just seen that in Seattle, we then saw it here in Austin, Texas when the Fortune 500 came to town.
[00:21:38.921 --> 00:21:40.902]  And we witnessed it and we videotaped it.
[00:21:40.962 --> 00:21:44.803]  Now, it doesn't matter if it is Genoa, Italy.
[00:21:44.863 --> 00:21:51.846]  It doesn't matter if it's Glen Eagles in Scotland in the G8 meeting back in 2005.
[00:21:54.486 --> 00:21:55.569]  It's the same group.
[00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:57.654]  Sometimes it's even the same people.
[00:21:57.714 --> 00:21:59.799]  I recognize them when they take their mask off.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.189]  And in the case of Seattle, they housed them.
[00:22:05.982 --> 00:22:18.744]  See, you had 60,000 peaceful people out there against globalization, against Republicans and Democrats, breaking the left-right paradigm, waking the people up, saying, we don't want globalization, we don't want Congress to hand over its authority to the unelected, unaccountable World Trade Organization.
[00:22:19.224 --> 00:22:25.445]  And all of a sudden, 50 anarchists throw bottles, hit cops, burn crash cans, and we got cops being ordered, stand down, stand down!
[00:22:25.465 --> 00:22:27.126]  The cops are going, ah, bleeding!
[00:22:27.806 --> 00:22:29.366]  When we get back, I'll tell you the rest of the story.
[00:22:29.546 --> 00:22:31.706]  It was all hired, all run by the U.S.
[00:22:31.806 --> 00:22:32.046]  Army.
[00:22:32.607 --> 00:22:33.247]  Well, guess what?
[00:22:33.287 --> 00:22:35.187]  They caught them in Canada.
[00:22:35.999 --> 00:22:47.203]  So they could show you, look at the protesters, they're bad, see the Montebello thing is reasonable, the SPP is reasonable, and the cops have now been caught with rocks, assaulting other police.
[00:22:47.544 --> 00:22:49.264]  It was all staged.
[00:22:49.624 --> 00:22:51.785]  It is so criminal, it blows my mind.
[00:22:52.045 --> 00:22:52.506]  Stay with us.
[00:23:00.732 --> 00:23:03.614]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:23:03.954 --> 00:23:06.837]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:23:07.057 --> 00:23:13.261]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisory, and major transportation routes?

[00:24:05.002 --> 00:24:08.844]  Maybe an antidepressant to help control your anxiety and depression.
[00:24:09.064 --> 00:24:11.845]  Maybe a nerve pill here and there just to help you cope.
[00:24:12.045 --> 00:24:14.206]  Maybe a drink at night just to take the edge off.
[00:24:14.466 --> 00:24:15.327]  And that second drink?
[00:24:15.527 --> 00:24:16.547]  Well, who's counting?
[00:24:16.747 --> 00:24:18.548]  But nobody knows how much you worry.
[00:24:18.808 --> 00:24:19.889]  How stressed out you are.
[00:24:21.476 --> 00:24:26.458]  Well, nobody understands the fear you have, the lack of satisfaction in your life, the loneliness.
[00:24:26.778 --> 00:24:27.699]  Well, I understand.
[00:24:27.719 --> 00:24:30.340]  I'm Lucinda Bassett, founder of the Midwest Center.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:34.302]  I suffered for over 20 years with anxiety, depression, panic, and stress.
[00:24:34.762 --> 00:24:37.423]  Maybe you don't have to depend on medication and alcohol.

[00:24:56.457 --> 00:24:56.937]  1-800-422-0488.
[00:24:57.077 --> 00:25:06.145]  Do you suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, unbalanced cholesterol, or clogged arteries?
[00:25:06.365 --> 00:25:10.449]  Do you want to live free of sickness, pain, and fear with increased vitality?

[00:25:18.792 --> 00:25:22.334]  It's called Heart and Body Extract, and it's going to change your life.
[00:25:22.594 --> 00:25:28.116]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, was astonished by how quickly the product worked for her.
[00:25:28.316 --> 00:25:32.518]  Within two weeks of using the formula, my blood pressure went from 160 over 110 to 120 over 70.
[00:25:32.558 --> 00:25:34.659]  Typically, a person will notice a difference within the first bottle.
[00:25:39.821 --> 00:25:42.664]  So, exactly how does Heart and Body Extract work?
[00:25:42.804 --> 00:25:52.735]  What happens with a formula, Heart and Body Extract, is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[00:25:52.935 --> 00:25:56.840]  Here are just a few of the benefits associated with Heart and Body Extract.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.022]  Angina is gone in just a few days.
[00:25:59.042 --> 00:25:59.763]  Blood pressure,
[00:25:59.943 --> 00:26:03.304]  Move back to normal and irregular heartbeat returns to normal.
[00:26:03.544 --> 00:26:07.205]  Heart and body extract works by making sure your body is in balance.
[00:26:07.485 --> 00:26:12.027]  Doctors who've tried heart and body extract with their patients are thrilled with the results.
[00:26:12.347 --> 00:26:15.348]  Dr. Mark Goodman talks about his experience with the product.
[00:26:15.368 --> 00:26:17.089]  My experience has been tremendous.
[00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:24.811]  Using something that is natural, that is absorbed into the body, particularly because it's in a liquid form, I think it's the best way to go.
[00:26:24.831 --> 00:26:27.692]  Dr. Sharif also witnessed the positive effects with his patients.
[00:26:27.992 --> 00:26:32.653]  This is the most courageous development that I think that I have seen in a long while.
[00:26:32.773 --> 00:26:36.214]  It deals with these patients who are so ill.
[00:26:36.234 --> 00:26:37.335]  I am just amazed.
[00:26:37.615 --> 00:26:40.116]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[00:26:59.402 --> 00:27:05.524]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:27:05.584 --> 00:27:06.065]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:27:25.194 --> 00:27:27.437]  This is a big story we're talking about here.
[00:27:28.718 --> 00:27:42.975]  Remember, what happened just four or five days ago in Eastern Canada, in Montebello, they're having this SPP, Security and Prosperity Partnership meeting.
[00:27:43.335 --> 00:27:45.858]  They've tried to keep the last two meetings secret.
[00:27:46.613 --> 00:27:48.373]  People have sued them to get the documents.
[00:27:48.393 --> 00:27:49.254]  You get the documents.
[00:27:49.274 --> 00:27:50.694]  They're engaging in high treason.
[00:27:51.134 --> 00:27:52.414]  Selling out our infrastructure.
[00:27:52.454 --> 00:27:54.695]  Selling out our roads, our waterways.
[00:27:54.755 --> 00:27:58.535]  Handing them over to multi-nationals and so-called privatization deals.
[00:28:00.456 --> 00:28:02.956]  Merging our bureaucracies the whole nine yards.
[00:28:06.377 --> 00:28:11.958]  And then we find out... Well, first off, people watching television, all they saw
[00:28:12.728 --> 00:28:16.852]  Was it the thousands of peaceful protesters that showed up at Parliament?
[00:28:17.833 --> 00:28:22.137]  You know, the middle-aged families with their children, the major unions.
[00:28:22.438 --> 00:28:23.599]  There were nine U.S.
[00:28:23.759 --> 00:28:29.965]  unions, a bunch of Canadian unions up there, conservatives, liberals, well-spoken people, press conferences.
[00:28:30.506 --> 00:28:34.610]  You didn't see that on the news, and we monitored it, and our listeners monitored it.
[00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:35.671]  You didn't see that.
[00:28:36.292 --> 00:28:46.261]  What you saw on CNN and FOX was about a 30 second clip of President Bush saying, oh, you're a bunch of conspiracy theorists and nuts, think we're setting up a North American Union at this.
[00:28:46.481 --> 00:28:53.307]  And then it cuts to 15 anarchists going, ahhhhhhh, like that, fighting with each other.
[00:28:54.748 --> 00:28:56.009]  Well, guess what happened?
[00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:58.892]  Citizens of Canada and the U.S.
[00:28:58.912 --> 00:29:02.235]  with their own video cameras from every conceivable angle shot what happened.
[00:29:03.544 --> 00:29:15.208]  And it turns out that the anarchists would just march up to police, they would give little hand signals with the police, the cops would walk over, cops in anarchist outfits, would walk over and give a cue to the cops, and then they would have this little fake fight.
[00:29:15.448 --> 00:29:24.531]  And if you watch police riot training videos, there's a bunch of these on the web, just type in, uh, police riot training, or martial law training, and you'll see it from North Carolina to Texas.
[00:29:24.832 --> 00:29:31.714]  It'll be people dressed up like anarchists fighting, crashing into the cops, they throw rocks, bottles at each other, there's cops on horseback, it's rough!
[00:29:32.583 --> 00:29:33.924]  Well, see, they do the same thing.
[00:29:33.964 --> 00:29:43.629]  They do simulated fights for the news cameras, and then they put it on television, and they'll even have 10 or 15 or something big like Seattle, 50 hired thugs.
[00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:46.871]  And in Seattle, it's all in my film, Police State to the Takeover.
[00:29:47.271 --> 00:29:51.514]  We have clips of the newscast, and the cops, and the citizens, and interviews we did on top of it.
[00:29:52.794 --> 00:29:54.035]  It shows the unbelievable.
[00:29:54.824 --> 00:30:01.469]  They took 50 of these hardcore communists who were for big government and for the World Trade Organization and the rest of it.
[00:30:01.689 --> 00:30:06.013]  They sent them to Oregon to a training camp to train them to be anarchists.
[00:30:06.093 --> 00:30:07.074]  Notice they have red flags.
[00:30:07.194 --> 00:30:10.777]  Anarchists who were for no government, but that have the flag of total government communism.
[00:30:11.577 --> 00:30:14.940]  And they showed up in Seattle, tore everything up, burned everything for a day.
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.502]  The media showed it and said, look, the cops aren't doing anything.
[00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:20.570]  And it turns out they're being led by Delta Force.
[00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.131]  This was in the Seattle Times.
[00:30:22.411 --> 00:30:23.592]  Seattle Intelligencer.
[00:30:23.832 --> 00:30:25.012]  Seattle Post Intelligencer.
[00:30:25.232 --> 00:30:27.473]  It was in Seattle Weekly.
[00:30:27.713 --> 00:30:30.235]  It was in the three major papers of Seattle.
[00:30:30.255 --> 00:30:31.095]  It's all in my film.
[00:30:31.335 --> 00:30:33.536]  Just type Police State 2 The Takeover into Google.
[00:30:33.576 --> 00:30:34.657]  You can go watch the two-hour film.
[00:30:34.957 --> 00:30:36.117]  Go watch Cops Admitting It.
[00:30:36.437 --> 00:30:38.498]  We were ordered to stand down the government run of these people.
[00:30:38.718 --> 00:30:44.101]  Then they went and housed the 50 anarchists for a week while they attacked the peaceful people.
[00:30:44.685 --> 00:30:47.267]  The cops weren't allowed to attack the hired thugs.
[00:30:47.527 --> 00:30:51.271]  We have them then being released, like a pit bull on a chain is being beaten.
[00:30:51.531 --> 00:30:55.894]  The kid that's beating the pit bull is then told to go indoors, and they put an old lady down in front of the pit bull.
[00:30:56.315 --> 00:31:12.008]  We have cops running up to old ladies who are out front their houses, savagely hitting them with billy clubs so hard they're breaking bones, and then young women on the ground with cops, with pleasure, stomping the women in the head and grunting with hatred and exertion as they do it.
[00:31:13.129 --> 00:31:14.609]  We have the City Council admitting it.
[00:31:14.849 --> 00:31:17.070]  We have it all on tape and police stay to the takeover.
[00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:21.270]  My point here is, is that I've had to see this over and over again.
[00:31:21.491 --> 00:31:23.711]  So a few months after that, they have the Fortune 500.
[00:31:24.071 --> 00:31:32.152]  A few months after that night on, they have the Fortune 500, and they've issued the same Darth Vader outfit, the same black, you know, uniforms and armor.
[00:31:33.273 --> 00:31:36.113]  And I'm out there going, these are cops shoving people and starting stuff!
[00:31:36.173 --> 00:31:40.554]  I'm like, and all of a sudden, a little anarchist run over and like, yeah Jones, and we're gonna kill you!
[00:31:41.317 --> 00:31:42.437]  We're gonna kill you someday!
[00:31:42.477 --> 00:31:44.038]  And it was like, and you can tell us what he means it.
[00:31:44.058 --> 00:31:46.298]  And I was like, oh my God, you guys are for real!
[00:31:46.558 --> 00:31:49.118]  And I look up and I go, so you work for those guys up on the building.
[00:31:49.318 --> 00:31:50.139]  And he goes, that's right!
[00:31:50.819 --> 00:31:52.259]  And you're dead when we take over!
[00:31:53.179 --> 00:31:54.840]  And then went back over with his buddy cops.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:55.880]  Okay?
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:01.241]  Now, there I start screaming so the cops run over and act like they arrest the two Austin PD.
[00:32:01.261 --> 00:32:04.181]  And there were PD, Austin PD there that day are listening right now.
[00:32:04.421 --> 00:32:08.182]  And I want you to consciously ask yourselves, how have you gotten so evil?
[00:32:09.159 --> 00:32:18.849]  That you go out with people trying to engage in their First Amendment, and you engage in crimes trying to get riots started, so you can beat the hell out of people like me!
[00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:21.792]  What has happened to our country?
[00:32:21.952 --> 00:32:23.193]  What's happened to the West?
[00:32:23.393 --> 00:32:24.594]  What's happened to the world?
[00:32:27.617 --> 00:32:28.898]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:32:28.958 --> 00:32:29.699]  And what happened here?
[00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:31.601]  You can watch the YouTube video of it, plain as day.
[00:32:31.621 --> 00:32:32.362]  You got the cops.
[00:32:33.286 --> 00:32:34.487]  With rocks in their hands.
[00:32:34.587 --> 00:32:37.669]  Big, old, huge... I mean, I'm talking a rock you can barely get in your hand.
[00:32:37.969 --> 00:32:39.270]  A rock you can kill somebody with.
[00:32:39.751 --> 00:32:41.872]  Running around, shoving people, trying to hit people.
[00:32:41.912 --> 00:32:43.553]  And you've got older demonstrators.
[00:32:43.573 --> 00:32:45.615]  One of them's the head of a major union.
[00:32:45.975 --> 00:32:46.415]  A doctor.
[00:32:46.715 --> 00:32:47.896]  And others, they're going, stop it!
[00:32:47.916 --> 00:32:48.837]  I can't wait to interview them next week.
[00:32:48.857 --> 00:32:49.677]  We're going to get in touch with them.
[00:32:50.878 --> 00:32:51.679]  They're going, stop it!
[00:32:51.699 --> 00:32:52.319]  These are cops!
[00:32:52.359 --> 00:32:52.960]  These are cops!
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:53.600]  These are cops!
[00:32:54.141 --> 00:32:54.601]  Look at them!
[00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:55.361]  Look at their boots!
[00:32:55.442 --> 00:32:59.825]  The cops were so dumb, they're wearing the same boots as the cops in the riot gear.
[00:33:00.585 --> 00:33:01.666]  These are huge guys.
[00:33:04.122 --> 00:33:08.149]  I mean, you know, your regular anarchist is a little dope-spoken, you know, chicken-neck person.
[00:33:08.189 --> 00:33:10.073]  I mean, these are big, bull cops.
[00:33:10.825 --> 00:33:13.247]  And then all of a sudden the cops get their masks jerked off.
[00:33:13.267 --> 00:33:15.388]  You can see it's cops that look really upset and embarrassed.
[00:33:15.588 --> 00:33:16.989]  We got screenshots of them up there.
[00:33:17.289 --> 00:33:20.051]  And so they run over and whisper to the cops, okay, we're going to stage something.
[00:33:20.071 --> 00:33:21.512]  And then they act like they're attacking the cops.
[00:33:21.692 --> 00:33:23.354]  And the cops grab them, throw them down on the ground.
[00:33:23.554 --> 00:33:24.514]  They zoom in on the boots.
[00:33:24.935 --> 00:33:26.636]  Same decal, same name boot.
[00:33:26.896 --> 00:33:31.559]  The neocons on the web said we were liars and conspiracy theorists and making up that it was cops.
[00:33:31.759 --> 00:33:33.100]  We know cops when we've seen them.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.581]  We've seen it over and over again.
[00:33:35.081 --> 00:33:37.243]  Now they've admitted, okay, those are our cops.
[00:33:37.643 --> 00:33:41.404]  First they tried to say it was a conspiracy, but then they counted the number of protesters arrested.
[00:33:41.684 --> 00:33:45.685]  The four that were arrested that were real protesters, everybody knew and they had their names.
[00:33:46.005 --> 00:33:55.588]  And then, it went on local TV, people recognized who the cops were, they were local federal police, they were local, um, Mounties.
[00:33:55.748 --> 00:33:56.228]  Shameful!
[00:33:56.288 --> 00:34:04.830]  So imagine, the police in the US, they do it in Mexico too, the police in Mexico, the police in Canada, the police in Germany, the police in England.
[00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:06.831]  Oh my God, Putin does this all the time in Russia.
[00:34:07.612 --> 00:34:20.084]  They dress their own cops up like anarchists, they go into the big foundations, big government-funded foundations, Ford Foundation-funded and others, anarchists, who then mill around with them under their command.
[00:34:21.205 --> 00:34:23.367]  In some cases, actual U.S.
[00:34:23.767 --> 00:34:30.073]  cream-of-the-crop special forces commands them on the ground to carry this out.
[00:34:31.562 --> 00:34:33.463]  I mean, I'm asking police out there.
[00:34:34.003 --> 00:34:36.284]  How do you do this to your countries?
[00:34:36.724 --> 00:34:49.329]  You go out and commit crimes, and attack other officers, in some cases unknowing officers, and then you blame it on the First Amendment, and then they set up for Seattle.
[00:34:49.689 --> 00:34:52.490]  Oh, we've got to ban protests in many areas.
[00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.311]  Well, we're banning them in the city.
[00:34:54.751 --> 00:34:56.812]  And then, oh, we've got to have free speech zones.
[00:34:57.975 --> 00:35:13.321]  We can have a spontaneous Hillary Clinton, or a spontaneous George Bush, as long as they're establishment rally, but if anybody shows up at a downtown park wearing a shirt that says, no blood for oil, or down with Bush, or down for Hillary, it's both parties doing it, you are arrested.
[00:35:13.541 --> 00:35:15.242]  And I have stacks of these articles.
[00:35:15.682 --> 00:35:25.306]  Just this week, you know, I took a few days off, but I couldn't stay off the computer, and I was reading all the mainline articles out of North Carolina, and Georgia, and Tennessee, and Texas, and Oregon.
[00:35:26.346 --> 00:35:27.567]  There were all these articles.
[00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:36.192]  Where people would just go to a public event and be arrested and then be charged with felonies!
[00:35:38.012 --> 00:35:44.233]  And then articles where people would have signs out on the street corner saying impeach Bush and cops pull up and arrest them!
[00:35:46.234 --> 00:35:52.955]  Or people have an upside down flag on their house and a Ron Paul sign saying America's in distress and a cop comes and beats them up and arrests them!
[00:35:52.995 --> 00:35:54.296]  I mean that was on national news!
[00:35:54.676 --> 00:35:56.396]  And they go, you're just not allowed to do that!
[00:35:57.105 --> 00:35:58.446]  Look, here it is today.
[00:35:59.086 --> 00:36:04.608]  It says, wrongly arrested Bush protester won $80,000 government settlement.
[00:36:04.949 --> 00:36:11.232]  On July 4th, Jeffrey and Nicole Rank attended a public Independence Day event in Charleston, West Virginia, where President Bush was speaking.
[00:36:11.552 --> 00:36:17.855]  Despite the fact that the event was open to the public and was held on public land, the Ranks were arrested for wearing anti-Bush t-shirts.
[00:36:19.595 --> 00:36:25.278]  So the good news is, some lawsuits are being won over all this, but I'm asking you, the listeners, I'm asking police out there,
[00:36:25.968 --> 00:36:30.232]  I mean, how has it gotten to this point where these were staged terror attacks?
[00:36:30.592 --> 00:36:35.417]  Staging attacking someone with a rock to stage a riot is terror.
[00:36:36.217 --> 00:36:37.098]  Under your own U.S.
[00:36:37.118 --> 00:36:37.458]  Code.
[00:36:37.959 --> 00:36:41.262]  I mean, that's an example of government-sponsored terror.
[00:36:41.542 --> 00:36:43.504]  Government-sponsored hysteria and fear.
[00:36:44.084 --> 00:36:45.285]  And I'm tired of it, man.
[00:36:45.386 --> 00:36:47.347]  And I'm glad you're getting caught.
[00:36:47.628 --> 00:36:48.408]  We'll be right back.
[00:36:48.428 --> 00:36:48.889]  Stay with us.
[00:37:00.831 --> 00:37:06.052]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:37:06.212 --> 00:37:14.295]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:37:14.555 --> 00:37:23.097]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[00:37:23.157 --> 00:37:23.637]  Potassium
[00:37:23.697 --> 00:37:29.039]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:37:29.239 --> 00:37:34.322]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:37:34.442 --> 00:37:43.325]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:37:43.565 --> 00:37:48.348]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium
[00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:53.671]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:37:53.831 --> 00:37:56.934]  Sure, you've got a mortgage and credit cards.
[00:37:56.974 --> 00:38:01.238]  Your debt creation is probably the smartest thing you've ever done.
[00:38:01.278 --> 00:38:04.281]  How would it be to find $75, $150, $200,000 or more you never knew you had?
[00:38:17.043 --> 00:38:21.486]  Now the task force has strategies to make these debts into virtual savings accounts.
[00:38:22.026 --> 00:38:24.368]  Ben Franklin said, a penny saved is a penny earned.
[00:38:24.988 --> 00:38:33.454]  By doing nothing more than you're doing right now, because you've used your credit, the right strategies can make the debt part of your financial life the smartest thing you've ever done.
[00:38:33.994 --> 00:38:36.696]  Oh, by the way, your strategies cost you nothing out of pocket.
[00:38:37.337 --> 00:38:40.139]  Go ahead and check out the debt elimination scams if you'd like to.

[00:40:18.543 --> 00:40:18.944]  It is not.

[00:41:24.258 --> 00:41:26.279]  Welcome back, we're live my friends.
[00:41:26.299 --> 00:41:27.600]  It is the 26th day of August 2007.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:34.365]  I promise we'll eat George, Paula, Rick, Michael and many others at 877-595-25 here in just a minute or so.
[00:41:34.405 --> 00:41:38.148]  But I want to restate it again for the record.
[00:41:39.512 --> 00:42:01.976]  It is a big deal when the federal governments of Canada, the U.S., and most of the other western governments, we've seen them do the same thing, openly send in feds and local police to stage burning trash cans, attacking cops, four video cameras, to then fire with rubber bullets, and to physically attack, and I mean in Seattle, they went into neighborhoods.
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:10.645]  And I mean, we got them beating old women down, pulling cars over randomly, and spraying pepper spray in people's faces, just a frothing, it's like mind control!
[00:42:10.905 --> 00:42:24.413]  A police riot, it's like, release the Cybertar, or release the, uh, something out of, something out of Lord of the Rings or something, you know, when they release all the, uh, all the minions of Sauron or something.
[00:42:24.433 --> 00:42:25.474]  I mean, I don't understand it!
[00:42:26.172 --> 00:42:40.817]  I mean, to go with all these peaceful, mainly middle-aged people, standing around going, no to globalization, no to the New World Order, no to NAFTA, no to expansion of GATT, no to the SPP, and there's cops running around with rocks, hitting other cops, staging it!
[00:42:40.917 --> 00:42:42.618]  I mean, that is so criminal!
[00:42:43.238 --> 00:42:47.061]  And they were about to beat the living daylights out of those people, folks.
[00:42:47.641 --> 00:42:49.503]  I mean, do they have people die at these things?
[00:42:49.803 --> 00:42:53.345]  Where they shoot rubber bullets up close and it goes through the eye and into the brain?
[00:42:53.365 --> 00:42:54.786]  I mean, I'm tired of it, man!
[00:42:55.367 --> 00:42:56.848]  I mean, why do you do this?
[00:42:57.288 --> 00:43:00.290]  Well, you work for the globalists and they want to be able to ban protests.
[00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:04.834]  And they're restricting them, and they're coordinating them off, and they're claiming free speech zones.
[00:43:05.934 --> 00:43:07.015]  I had Austin cops.
[00:43:08.436 --> 00:43:10.898]  We were protesting Perry downtown a few months ago.
[00:43:11.852 --> 00:43:13.913]  And I had also conscripts here and I'm allowed to without a permit.
[00:43:13.933 --> 00:43:17.295]  And I said, listen, you can tell some people that and you can fool them, but not me.
[00:43:17.836 --> 00:43:19.237]  And I said, we're not blocking these streets.
[00:43:19.257 --> 00:43:22.519]  This is not a permit to take over Congress and march down the street.
[00:43:22.839 --> 00:43:23.760]  That you need a permit for.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:28.222]  I'm here and I'm not blocking the sidewalk and you can go ahead and arrest me and I'm going to sue you.
[00:43:28.462 --> 00:43:29.983]  You can beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.
[00:43:30.003 --> 00:43:30.924]  And he said, I'm going to arrest you.
[00:43:32.029 --> 00:43:32.770]  And I said, go ahead.
[00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:39.093]  And then he went and told the media that he hadn't done it, but I'd caught him on video and then later got it out there and people saw the lie.
[00:43:39.493 --> 00:43:42.355]  But again, threatening to arrest me for my First Amendment.
[00:43:42.535 --> 00:43:43.916]  And I'm not supposed to get mad at you?
[00:43:44.416 --> 00:43:45.777]  I mean, I try hard to like you.
[00:43:46.217 --> 00:43:49.179]  But you work for an evil government that has you doing evil things.
[00:43:49.419 --> 00:43:50.580]  And now I gotta thank you?
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.181]  Well, listen, let me just tell the cops something.
[00:43:52.661 --> 00:43:54.982]  You get hired to go out and provocateur events.
[00:43:55.423 --> 00:44:01.966]  Well, higher up in black ops, they carry out things like 9-11 and blame it on foggy boogeymen.
[00:44:01.986 --> 00:44:02.806]  Do you understand that?
[00:44:03.446 --> 00:44:06.148]  You see, this is government-sponsored terror what you did in Austin.
[00:44:06.428 --> 00:44:08.289]  It's government-sponsored terror in Montebello.
[00:44:08.529 --> 00:44:10.330]  It's government-sponsored terror in Genoa.
[00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:12.331]  It's government-sponsored terror in Glen Eagles.
[00:44:13.237 --> 00:44:15.439]  It's government-sponsored terror in Seattle.
[00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:16.500]  And you've been caught.
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:23.165]  It's now in major newspapers, and there's millions of views on this on the web, and now people are finally getting it.
[00:44:25.887 --> 00:44:27.409]  Now they're finally understanding.
[00:44:28.249 --> 00:44:35.675]  Because listen, back in, you know, back in 99, 2000, when stuff was going on in Austin around the country, I didn't know that all the anarchists themselves worked for them.
[00:44:36.476 --> 00:44:38.798]  And I guess there may be some young 15-year-olds who don't know.
[00:44:39.238 --> 00:44:40.339]  But I mean, these are like 35, 40-year-old people.
[00:44:43.084 --> 00:44:43.504]  They know!
[00:44:43.524 --> 00:44:46.686]  They're on the payroll, folks, and they're being commanded by cops!
[00:44:47.227 --> 00:44:48.287]  And by feds!
[00:44:48.828 --> 00:44:49.968]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:52.330]  Coming up, I'll get into Aaron Russo's death.
[00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:53.571]  It was a great tragedy.
[00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:57.013]  He died in the early morning hours of Friday, just a couple days ago.
[00:44:57.673 --> 00:45:00.855]  And we've got some comments up on PrisonPlanet.com about that.
[00:45:00.915 --> 00:45:04.778]  Again, coming up during the week, I'm going to be doing some interviews, and Aaron's going to be doing some interviews.
[00:45:05.194 --> 00:45:06.215]  I'm dealing with Aaron Russo.
[00:45:25.984 --> 00:45:27.105]  They wanted to keep that secret.
[00:45:27.125 --> 00:45:32.907]  They're very upset that that came out because it is a big infomercial for their propaganda, the fathers of yellow journalism.
[00:45:33.387 --> 00:45:35.287]  Let's talk to George in Florida.
[00:45:35.307 --> 00:45:36.128]  You're on the air, George.
[00:45:36.168 --> 00:45:36.728]  Thanks for holding.
[00:45:37.628 --> 00:45:38.528]  I want to say one thing.
[00:45:38.548 --> 00:45:42.930]  When I heard out when Aaron Russo passed away, my heart was heavy.
[00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:44.610]  And believe me, I felt a little vacuum.
[00:45:44.651 --> 00:45:52.953]  But then something inside me said, well, by honoring Aaron Russo, we just keep doing what we're doing and keep winning the Infowar.
[00:45:52.973 --> 00:45:53.974]  I agree.
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.481]  You know, I only take a vacation once or twice a year.
[00:45:57.501 --> 00:46:00.002]  I took off three days, went to the Texas coast.
[00:46:00.322 --> 00:46:01.203]  People were like, the hurricane!
[00:46:01.243 --> 00:46:02.383]  No, the hurricane hit Mexico, folks.
[00:46:02.423 --> 00:46:03.303]  Texas coast was fine.
[00:46:04.044 --> 00:46:05.384]  And it was nice sunny weather.
[00:46:05.925 --> 00:46:07.545]  And I walked in about five o'clock.
[00:46:07.585 --> 00:46:09.906]  The phone had been ringing off the hook there at the motel.
[00:46:10.487 --> 00:46:12.748]  And that was my office center, and Russo died this morning.
[00:46:12.828 --> 00:46:18.971]  And I just, it was like a... It was like somebody took the wind out of my sails.
[00:46:19.011 --> 00:46:19.831]  It was really depressing.
[00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:20.830]  I don't think so.
[00:46:43.658 --> 00:46:43.978]  No, I know.
[00:46:43.998 --> 00:46:44.999]  Listen, my friend.
[00:46:45.019 --> 00:46:47.521]  Again, maybe it's where I grew up, but I grew up in Rockwall, Texas.
[00:46:47.621 --> 00:46:50.383]  The richest county in Texas, also the smallest county in Texas.
[00:46:50.423 --> 00:46:52.765]  So my dad, a dentist, was like a sharecropper in that town.
[00:46:52.785 --> 00:46:55.407]  You know, we lived in the 4 bedroom house, not the 20 bedroom house.
[00:47:11.581 --> 00:47:13.622]  I mean, he was on the low end of the scale.
[00:47:13.662 --> 00:47:21.628]  So I grew up, and some of my friends, and some of the other neighborhoods that I was in, and people I knew, they were billionaires.
[00:47:22.488 --> 00:47:24.690]  And so I got a chance to see how people really live.
[00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:26.331]  And let me tell you something.
[00:47:26.371 --> 00:47:31.374]  The sheriff, and he later went to prison for this, was a cocaine, heroin, and marijuana dealer.
[00:47:32.015 --> 00:47:33.776]  The police were almost all dealing it.
[00:47:34.607 --> 00:47:35.949]  And, uh, everybody knew it.
[00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:38.454]  And, see, I didn't use drugs, but most everybody else did.
[00:47:38.474 --> 00:47:44.086]  And it was just like, yeah, I went to the cops and, and, and, so, you know, I went to the cops and bought some cocaine.
[00:47:44.126 --> 00:47:45.429]  I went to the cops and bought the marijuana.
[00:47:46.135 --> 00:47:53.181]  And then I'd see cops bust my friends for marijuana or for beer, and I'd go up and shoot my mouth off and say, you know, you guys sell that.
[00:47:53.201 --> 00:47:55.202]  And they'd say, we're going to kill you if you don't shut up.
[00:47:55.222 --> 00:47:58.305]  And they called my dad up and they said, look, move out of the town or we're going to kill you.
[00:47:58.745 --> 00:48:02.809]  I didn't know why my dad suddenly, when I was 16, said we're moving to Austin and sold his dental practice.
[00:48:03.169 --> 00:48:07.913]  But I mean, the cops dealt the drugs and ruled, and later the sheriff went to prison for it.
[00:48:10.195 --> 00:48:13.097]  But a prominent retired FBI agent
[00:48:14.503 --> 00:48:18.365]  Right before he retired, he raided like a five bedroom house in our neighborhood.
[00:48:18.385 --> 00:48:21.246]  He lived right down the hill from us because we lived on a golf course.
[00:48:21.786 --> 00:48:24.787]  And it was right over the hole that we lived, you know, right above.
[00:48:24.807 --> 00:48:27.448]  He lived about two houses down on the next street.
[00:48:28.109 --> 00:48:31.630]  And I knew because people rode around on golf carts and you'd talk to people and find out who they were.
[00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:35.912]  And he was an FBI guy who had raided the house and then moved into it.
[00:48:36.432 --> 00:48:38.313]  And it was like a house an FBI agent couldn't afford.
[00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:47.121]  And then I moved down to Austin, and I had friends whose dads were in the FBI, and I'd be up on Cat Mountain, or I'd be, you know, up in Rob Roy, and back then it was a $2,000,000 house.
[00:48:47.181 --> 00:48:49.722]  And you're like, how are you living in a $2,000,000 house?
[00:48:49.762 --> 00:48:55.984]  You know, I mean, it's just, it's, folks, it's so corrupt, you can't even imagine it.
[00:48:57.164 --> 00:49:00.785]  And I'm just more and more freaked out every day.
[00:49:00.805 --> 00:49:04.906]  I realize that we're completely screwed.
[00:49:04.946 --> 00:49:08.407]  I mean, I don't know how else to say it, or how else to put it out there to you.
[00:49:10.903 --> 00:49:24.226]  And you've got an army of yuppies who will serve the corporate agenda, they'll produce whatever film the corporates want, they'll write whatever article the corporates want, they'll do whatever they say just to have that quote, success in this evil system.
[00:49:24.506 --> 00:49:34.029]  And now you see the dollar plunging, the housing market in trouble, the test scores falling even more, just every form of disease skyrocketing in the U.S.
[00:49:34.769 --> 00:49:35.149]  We see
[00:49:36.244 --> 00:49:40.425]  Just, just, we're falling apart because we've become so corrupt.
[00:49:42.426 --> 00:49:43.687]  And I just want to turn it around.
[00:49:44.487 --> 00:49:47.728]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rick in Belton.
[00:49:48.148 --> 00:49:49.209]  Rick, you're on the air.
[00:49:49.389 --> 00:49:49.789]  Welcome.
[00:49:49.929 --> 00:49:50.629]  Belton, Texas.
[00:49:50.689 --> 00:49:51.089]  Go ahead.
[00:49:51.869 --> 00:49:52.470]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:53.030]  I'm honored.
[00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:56.491]  Real briefly, I'm going to try to make this as brief as I can.
[00:49:56.651 --> 00:49:58.772]  On August 17th and on August 20th,
[00:49:59.708 --> 00:50:00.628]  Michael Medved.
[00:50:01.108 --> 00:50:16.893]  First, he had the Secretary of Commerce of the Bush Administration on on the 17th and basically told his audience, as limited as it is, I think he's on the lower rungs of the talk show hosts, but he told everybody that the Texas Corridor doesn't exist and the North American Union doesn't exist.
[00:50:16.953 --> 00:50:17.893]  And then next he attacked me.
[00:50:18.654 --> 00:50:26.316]  And then on the 20th, yes, he attacked Ron Paul by using you and he played you at your angriest.
[00:50:27.228 --> 00:50:39.994]  And I was actually a little worried about you, because maybe you were talking about this new documentary on the History Channel when you were so angry, but you said they ruined your life and you were all scum, you know how you get sometimes?
[00:50:40.675 --> 00:50:45.897]  And people who've listened to you for years, like I have, were really saddened by that broadcast.
[00:50:45.937 --> 00:50:49.399]  No, I understand, and listen, all Medford's doing is blowing his feet off.
[00:50:50.159 --> 00:50:55.602]  Look, the people, listen, last week, I had Limbaugh, I had Neil Bortz,
[00:50:56.355 --> 00:50:58.576]  I had Sean Hannity, and I'm not even looking for these clips.
[00:50:58.596 --> 00:50:59.357]  He's a clip sent to me.
[00:50:59.917 --> 00:51:04.840]  I had John Gibson, like three times, twice or three times, no, three times.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.342]  And I know Medved, because I got a bunch of calls, and I also sent the audio files.
[00:51:08.582 --> 00:51:11.183]  And frankly, I heard ten seconds of it, and I don't have time to even listen to it.
[00:51:12.604 --> 00:51:14.665]  All attack me with the same clips and the same things.
[00:51:14.765 --> 00:51:15.726]  It's talking points.
[00:51:16.966 --> 00:51:18.287]  And that's what depresses me.
[00:51:18.997 --> 00:51:23.364]  Is that in England, the BBC aired their hit piece against me again.
[00:51:24.285 --> 00:51:26.268]  Channel 4 aired a hit piece against me again.
[00:51:27.249 --> 00:51:29.553]  Here domestically, History Channel hit me last week.
[00:51:30.073 --> 00:51:31.055]  They're hitting me again tonight.
[00:51:32.517 --> 00:51:35.261]  And it just lets me know how evil they are.
[00:51:36.153 --> 00:51:42.501]  And Medved and all of them are there to neutralize conservatives so you don't wake up, so that it's too late when you finally wake up.
[00:51:43.082 --> 00:51:44.764]  Alright, we'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:51:44.804 --> 00:51:45.885]  We'll start up with your calls.
[00:51:46.185 --> 00:51:47.247]  Then get into the History Channel.
[00:51:47.287 --> 00:51:48.388]  Hit Peace and Aaron Russo.
[00:51:48.628 --> 00:51:49.069]  Stay with us.
[00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:51.630]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:58.793]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[00:51:59.053 --> 00:52:01.954]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[00:52:02.154 --> 00:52:07.796]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[00:52:08.056 --> 00:52:10.557]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[00:52:12.497 --> 00:52:16.959]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:23.121]  Looking for profits?
[00:52:23.201 --> 00:52:24.582]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:52:24.842 --> 00:52:28.125]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:52:28.165 --> 00:52:35.751]  This low-mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[00:52:35.811 --> 00:52:39.534]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.

[00:52:50.843 --> 00:52:51.063]  Bye!
[00:52:51.803 --> 00:52:52.164]  Icon.

[00:53:05.795 --> 00:53:07.637]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:09.018 --> 00:53:10.599]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:13.802]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:14.262 --> 00:53:17.585]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-
[00:53:19.399 --> 00:53:35.048]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:35.108 --> 00:53:36.889]  Now into the second hour.
[00:53:36.909 --> 00:53:37.850]  We're here every Sunday.
[00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:41.632]  You know I got a documentary crew here.
[00:53:43.773 --> 00:53:45.534]  Seems like every other week we've got one here now.
[00:53:46.753 --> 00:53:50.594]  But I was just telling them during the break, they were asking, what does it mean to have Rush Limbaugh attacking you?
[00:53:50.935 --> 00:53:52.175]  And Neil Bortz attacking you?
[00:53:52.455 --> 00:53:53.916]  And Michael Medved attacking you?
[00:53:54.436 --> 00:53:56.637]  And John Gibson on his radio show attacking you?
[00:53:56.777 --> 00:53:57.317]  And Sean Hannity?
[00:53:57.857 --> 00:53:59.758]  All in the same week, and that's what we know of.
[00:54:00.058 --> 00:54:02.479]  That's people in my office going, hey look, there's another audio file.
[00:54:02.699 --> 00:54:05.180]  Hey, here's another email from a listener, because they grabbed these and sent them to us.
[00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.460]  And I'm like, I don't want to hear it anymore.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.341]  I don't want to see it.
[00:54:10.461 --> 00:54:12.022]  Whitewood History Channel is attacking.
[00:54:12.737 --> 00:54:25.581]  They were attacking me the week before it came out, right when... And then meanwhile, I got guys that work for me over in England, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, they're attacking me on BBC, and they're attacking me on Channel 4, two different systems, the same days.
[00:54:27.021 --> 00:54:28.382]  I mean, I'm getting attacked everywhere!
[00:54:29.442 --> 00:54:31.222]  And it means we're effective, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:31.282 --> 00:54:33.023]  It means we've had an effect on these people.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:46.204]  Because they can have some communist, liberal, anti-gun, anti-America, anti-sovereignty personnel, bad-mouthing them all day, going, oh, those evil Republicans, oh, they're evil.
[00:54:46.584 --> 00:54:49.585]  There ain't no conservatives out in America see that and go, oh, Bush must be great!
[00:54:49.605 --> 00:54:58.048]  It's the same thing when Hitler, when, I almost said Hitler, when Hillary, or Hillary Clinton gets into power, as she probably will, you know, the anointed one,
[00:54:59.465 --> 00:55:00.286]  It'll be the same thing.
[00:55:00.326 --> 00:55:03.210]  Suddenly all these liberals that can see the police state, they'll suddenly love it.
[00:55:03.451 --> 00:55:05.253]  Because it's their police state.
[00:55:05.293 --> 00:55:07.176]  It's like when Clinton attacked Serbia.
[00:55:07.196 --> 00:55:07.937]  They all loved it.
[00:55:08.838 --> 00:55:09.519]  I mean, they love it!
[00:55:10.962 --> 00:55:13.523]  Well, see, I'll be attacking Hillary when she's doing that.
[00:55:13.624 --> 00:55:14.804]  I'll be exposing her.
[00:55:15.304 --> 00:55:17.225]  Because I'm a constitutionalist.
[00:55:17.285 --> 00:55:18.706]  It isn't about what party they're with.
[00:55:19.247 --> 00:55:20.927]  And so the neocons can't stand it.
[00:55:21.228 --> 00:55:23.049]  We will talk about the North American Union.
[00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.789]  We have the documents.
[00:55:24.029 --> 00:55:26.190]  We will talk about the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:36.336]  We will talk about... I remember the Chronicle last year here in Austin, local paper, said that the editor's notes said it was a lie that Central was owned by the Spanish.
[00:55:36.796 --> 00:55:37.136]  Company.
[00:55:37.517 --> 00:55:38.477]  It was a Spanish company.
[00:55:38.497 --> 00:55:41.179]  I mean, that's like saying, the sun didn't come up this morning.
[00:55:41.659 --> 00:55:45.141]  The level of lying... We're not lying to you.
[00:55:45.201 --> 00:55:46.241]  We're telling the truth.
[00:55:46.441 --> 00:55:47.602]  They're lying to you.
[00:55:48.122 --> 00:55:51.644]  Fake liberals like Louis Black at the Chronicle is a liar.
[00:55:52.225 --> 00:55:52.605]  Okay?
[00:55:53.065 --> 00:55:54.786]  He's an establishment hack, period.
[00:55:54.966 --> 00:55:59.268]  The establishment wants the roads handed over to foreign interests, and by God, he's going to tell you it's good.
[00:55:59.949 --> 00:56:01.110]  He'll tell you it isn't.
[00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:03.671]  I mean, he could sell snow to the Eskimos, folks.
[00:56:04.793 --> 00:56:06.955]  Okay, and that's a local level issue.
[00:56:06.975 --> 00:56:07.936]  Take it nationally.
[00:56:09.257 --> 00:56:10.338]  They're gonna lie to you.
[00:56:12.299 --> 00:56:14.781]  And, frankly, I like fighting them.
[00:56:14.861 --> 00:56:16.042]  I like standing up against them.
[00:56:16.302 --> 00:56:18.084]  You know, on one side, I hate their corruption.
[00:56:18.144 --> 00:56:18.905]  I hate their tyranny.
[00:56:18.965 --> 00:56:19.605]  I'm sick of them.
[00:56:20.746 --> 00:56:22.988]  But the other side of me, I'm like, you know what?
[00:56:23.028 --> 00:56:23.969]  I'm a little selfish.
[00:56:24.029 --> 00:56:26.591]  Man, sometimes I wish I never would have gotten involved in all this.
[00:56:27.353 --> 00:56:32.876]  Sometimes I wish I'd have gone and sold cars, or I wish I'd have gone and done fishing trips at the coast.
[00:56:33.936 --> 00:56:38.759]  Sometimes I wish I'd have gone and pumped gas out in the country and subsidized living on the farm.
[00:56:38.799 --> 00:56:42.100]  Everybody knows you can't really run a farm nowadays and be a small farm.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:46.242]  You've got to work at the gas station or the lumber yard and come back and pull double duty at your farm.
[00:56:46.442 --> 00:56:49.484]  The point is I'd be happy literally shoveling horse manure.
[00:56:49.964 --> 00:56:50.224]  Okay?
[00:56:50.504 --> 00:56:51.925]  I don't like crowds of people.
[00:56:51.945 --> 00:56:53.486]  I don't like having to deal with people.
[00:56:53.846 --> 00:56:55.427]  I don't like having to do this.
[00:56:55.847 --> 00:57:02.990]  I found out there was a plan for a one world government because they put out hundreds of books and documents and legislation and congressional record.
[00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:04.831]  I found out 15 years ago.
[00:57:04.911 --> 00:57:06.792]  I got on air almost 13 years ago.
[00:57:07.192 --> 00:57:08.432]  And then I was called a kook.
[00:57:08.633 --> 00:57:14.015]  I remember the New York Times saying I was a kook, that the Dillenberg Group didn't exist.
[00:57:14.625 --> 00:57:16.627]  I mean, just, you know, they lie to you!
[00:57:16.687 --> 00:57:18.308]  They lie to you and they lie to you!
[00:57:18.548 --> 00:57:21.791]  And I tell you, now it's in the Dallas Morning News, the Bilderberg Group exists.
[00:57:22.191 --> 00:57:24.713]  And now it's in the Houston Chronicle, the Bilderberg Group exists.
[00:57:25.054 --> 00:57:27.536]  And now it's in the New York Times, the Bilderberg Group exists.
[00:57:27.696 --> 00:57:37.824]  They just tell you it's a good secret meeting of the world's banking chiefs and royalty that dispatch, you know, and summon our governor up there, Rick Perry.
[00:57:42.378 --> 00:57:45.640]  I mean, all I know is they are taking our liberties and our freedoms.
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.281]  They are staging terror attacks.
[00:57:47.301 --> 00:57:48.402]  They are staging riots.
[00:57:48.702 --> 00:57:50.103]  They are trying to stage riots.
[00:57:50.463 --> 00:57:53.885]  They are putting mercury in your vaccines to brain damage you by design.
[00:57:54.085 --> 00:57:56.787]  And I found the documents from the 20s when they planned it.
[00:57:56.987 --> 00:57:57.908]  It's called eugenics.
[00:57:59.105 --> 00:58:00.727]  Eugenics, by the way, isn't what you've been told.
[00:58:00.747 --> 00:58:01.649]  That's only one part of it.
[00:58:01.889 --> 00:58:04.132]  About making the race better by culling people.
[00:58:04.312 --> 00:58:04.973]  And that's bad.
[00:58:05.473 --> 00:58:05.834]  No, no, no.
[00:58:05.914 --> 00:58:12.382]  It's actually dumbing and exterminating the mass of people so the elite can flourish and control what's left of us.
[00:58:12.703 --> 00:58:14.224]  It's so diabolical.
[00:58:14.445 --> 00:58:16.788]  And the elite's scared of me because of Endgame, folks.
[00:58:17.569 --> 00:58:24.134]  And I told people when I made Endgame that it's the film that may get me sent to the who's scout, it's the film that may get a cap in my butt.
[00:58:24.154 --> 00:58:37.845]  But there's copies of it already distributed everywhere, they can't stop it from coming out, it will be put on YouTube, it will be put on Google if anything happens to me, and this film proves with their own documents and their own statements that they want a one world government set up so they can kill 80% of us.
[00:58:38.086 --> 00:58:38.466]  Believe me!
[00:58:38.786 --> 00:58:46.991]  I'm not being attacked as the main devil by the History Channel and by Rush Limbaugh and the whole pack of New World Order people because of me exposing 9-11.
[00:58:47.191 --> 00:58:49.652]  Because they can't stop all the other 9-11 researchers.
[00:58:49.912 --> 00:58:55.576]  They're attacking me right now, coast to coast, all over the planet, because of Endgame, folks.
[00:58:55.596 --> 00:58:58.057]  They're afraid of this film.
[00:58:58.257 --> 00:58:59.598]  Do you read me?
[00:59:00.218 --> 00:59:01.279]  Do you understand that?
[00:59:01.972 --> 00:59:08.918]  Because if you take this film and you pay attention to it, and you research it, you're going to find out the big secret, what you're not supposed to know.
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:16.885]  That's the only reason they haven't killed me, folks, is because they don't want to kill me and then have you pay attention to it.
[00:59:18.507 --> 00:59:21.029]  I don't want to have to get up here and talk about them killing me either.
[00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:23.211]  But let me tell you, I can feel it.
[00:59:24.412 --> 00:59:25.133]  You know what I mean?
[00:59:25.893 --> 00:59:28.796]  I can feel the eye looking right at me in the New World Order.
[00:59:30.763 --> 00:59:32.104]  And I'm sick and tired of it.
[00:59:33.684 --> 00:59:35.905]  I mean, I have to stand up and fight these people.
[00:59:37.406 --> 00:59:39.227]  I mean, let me tell you folks, it'll freak you out.
[00:59:39.627 --> 00:59:55.073]  I don't just get up here on air and say that the major Chicago papers, the Chicago Tribune among them, reported last year that Halliburton and Dinecourt run giant child kidnapping rinks.
[00:59:56.014 --> 00:59:58.135]  I had the makers of
[00:59:59.418 --> 01:00:04.760]  Brothers Keeper and a bunch of other big documentaries on Metallica and you know just award-winning.
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.241]  I mean they're as big as Michael Moore.
[01:00:06.621 --> 01:00:11.143]  They were here following me around for a week and they're gonna be back in New York when we're up there.
[01:00:11.163 --> 01:00:12.083]  This is cruising together too.
[01:00:12.103 --> 01:00:24.668]  It's been quite a string and during an interview I said you know the Chicago Tribune and Halliburton Dine Corps running child kidnapping rings and the guy said excuse me excuse me I believe a lot of what you said I'm pretty well informed and you know I'm but I don't buy that.
[01:00:24.889 --> 01:00:28.390]  I took him right over to Chicago Tribune and he basically almost crapped himself.
[01:00:29.241 --> 01:00:30.621]  And I just started pulling off articles.
[01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:33.142]  Here, they kidnapped 1.2 million.
[01:00:33.222 --> 01:00:35.603]  I mean, these people are killers!
[01:00:35.623 --> 01:00:36.683]  Do you understand me?
[01:00:36.703 --> 01:00:38.143]  This isn't a game!
[01:00:38.563 --> 01:00:45.705]  They got cops out in the open trying to stage riots so they can start shotgunning with rubber bullets an innocent crowd of men, women, and children!
[01:00:47.025 --> 01:00:48.306]  They don't play games!
[01:00:48.326 --> 01:00:49.266]  Do you understand that?
[01:00:49.446 --> 01:00:51.827]  They're killing this country right now!
[01:00:52.827 --> 01:00:54.047]  They're ending the Republic.
[01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:55.587]  They're ending the fiat currency.
[01:00:55.768 --> 01:00:57.388]  They're ending it all right now!
[01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:04.643]  Oh God.
[01:01:06.486 --> 01:01:12.996]  And what is even the point of trying to cover a two-hour History Channel attack piece that is a lie from pillar to post?
[01:01:13.657 --> 01:01:16.201]  It is a lie from the very first word to the end.
[01:01:16.321 --> 01:01:18.184]  I mean, an abominational lie
[01:01:19.812 --> 01:01:21.313]  Layer after layer of lies.
[01:01:21.333 --> 01:01:33.076]  They did stuff like shoot me talking to 500 people when there was standing room only at UT and then cut into a shot during intermission when there's a hundred in the crowd and say that's who was there to watch me.
[01:01:33.517 --> 01:01:38.178]  I mean they did stuff like blow the video up and blow the colors out so I look uglier than I usually do.
[01:01:38.198 --> 01:01:41.439]  I mean that's just the aesthetic tricks they played.
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:47.221]  That's just at one level the lies that these people engage in.
[01:01:48.234 --> 01:01:54.477]  And it's Hearst Publishing that put out the popular mechanics piece about 9-11, which has been proven to be a lie, from Pillar of the Post.
[01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:58.800]  But the general public reads that, but doesn't know how many continents there are?
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:01.481]  Who doesn't know what a sea is versus an ocean?
[01:02:01.661 --> 01:02:03.542]  Who can't name ten state capitals?
[01:02:03.862 --> 01:02:05.623]  Who doesn't know the three branches of government?
[01:02:05.803 --> 01:02:08.685]  Who don't know what the sixth or seventh or fourth amendment is?
[01:02:10.347 --> 01:02:12.988]  Hell, they just hear it's been debunked, they believe it.
[01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:14.889]  And the killers get to roll on!
[01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:19.511]  Let me tell all the people that are involved in these productions and these hit pieces, because I've seen them.
[01:02:19.551 --> 01:02:21.991]  I know very well that you know you're lying.
[01:02:22.392 --> 01:02:25.753]  You have now become accessories after the fact, and I hope you realize that.
[01:02:26.579 --> 01:02:27.941]  This is serious business!
[01:02:28.221 --> 01:02:32.226]  Those 2,800 and something people that died were human beings!
[01:02:32.266 --> 01:02:33.167]  They had families!
[01:02:33.347 --> 01:02:34.188]  They had wives!
[01:02:34.368 --> 01:02:35.269]  They had children!
[01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:38.854]  And they're dead now because your bosses murdered them!
[01:02:51.344 --> 01:03:00.347]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:00.747 --> 01:03:08.370]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:03:09.065 --> 01:03:16.129]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:03:16.529 --> 01:03:27.955]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:03:28.255 --> 01:03:31.797]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.

[01:04:06.459 --> 01:04:11.945]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[01:04:12.025 --> 01:04:16.349]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a yon revolution.
[01:04:16.649 --> 01:04:25.118]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[01:04:25.138 --> 01:04:27.721]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[01:04:27.981 --> 01:04:31.885]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[01:04:32.085 --> 01:04:38.492]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[01:04:52.566 --> 01:04:55.189]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:04:55.590 --> 01:05:00.576]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:00.917 --> 01:05:02.679]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:05:02.979 --> 01:05:07.585]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:07.625 --> 01:05:08.046]  I don't know.
[01:05:25.708 --> 01:05:26.749]  We have a good food supply.
[01:05:27.129 --> 01:05:30.633]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:05:30.953 --> 01:05:31.954]  How much will you need?
[01:05:32.174 --> 01:05:32.815]  We don't know.
[01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:34.016]  How much do you want?
[01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:34.936]  All you can get.
[01:05:35.117 --> 01:05:35.977]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:36.218 --> 01:05:38.980]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.262]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:05:41.282 --> 01:05:41.963]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:05:51.707 --> 01:05:52.127]  Attention!
[01:05:52.268 --> 01:05:54.229]  This is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:05:54.429 --> 01:05:58.672]  Honeybees are now mysteriously vanishing at an astonishing pace across the entire country.
[01:05:58.852 --> 01:06:01.754]  Why is this urgent message about honeybees so desperately important?
[01:06:01.995 --> 01:06:02.955]  The answer is easy.
[01:06:03.095 --> 01:06:09.260]  You see, honeybees produce a unique compound, fed only to the queen, that makes her live six times longer than other bees in the hive.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:13.583]  Some researchers now believe the compound may have miraculous effects on humans as well.
[01:06:13.743 --> 01:06:19.688]  The compound is called Royal Jelly, and is now available in an all-new, ultra-purified form called Gelosine Gold.
[01:06:19.868 --> 01:06:25.272]  The product has been designed for purity-conscious Americans who are concerned about contaminated Royal Jelly entering the U.S.
[01:06:25.312 --> 01:06:25.772]  from Asia.
[01:06:25.972 --> 01:06:30.336]  Solutions from Science is the only company authorized to sell Gelosine Gold in the U.S.
[01:06:30.576 --> 01:06:34.479]  They believe it to be the purest, most potent, and safest form of Royal Jelly in the world.
[01:06:34.679 --> 01:06:40.141]  GCN listeners can now purchase this product wholesale on the Solutions website without paying anything today.

[01:06:45.664 --> 01:06:48.165]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:04.857]  Raging for the truth.
[01:07:05.417 --> 01:07:07.197]  Exposing corruption.
[01:07:07.457 --> 01:07:10.638]  Dismantling the false left-right paradigm.
[01:07:11.119 --> 01:07:12.559]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:07:12.619 --> 01:07:15.340]  Alright, let's blast into your calls right now.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.981]  Rodney from Austin, Texas.
[01:07:17.081 --> 01:07:18.401]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:07:18.921 --> 01:07:20.762]  Hey Alex, thank you and welcome back.
[01:07:20.822 --> 01:07:21.262]  Thank you.
[01:07:22.542 --> 01:07:27.363]  I wanted to real briefly give you two stories I'd like to get your analysis on.
[01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:39.627]  I just read a story from UPI talking about this soldier that was about to be convicted of murdering the Iraqi citizens but sad to say his witnesses
[01:07:41.351 --> 01:07:44.214]  Well, that could be a coincidence, but I'll tell you what's not.
[01:07:44.234 --> 01:07:46.517]  The Colonel the Army sent over to investigate the torture shot himself.
[01:07:57.209 --> 01:08:00.211]  Uh, and then the captain investigating some murders was killed.
[01:08:00.411 --> 01:08:02.672]  So of course they're fragging people left and right.
[01:08:03.032 --> 01:08:05.453]  And we know that the order came from on high.
[01:08:05.713 --> 01:08:06.834]  We know they lied.
[01:08:07.094 --> 01:08:08.254]  We know they did fragging.
[01:08:08.615 --> 01:08:14.537]  And the evidence all indicates from on high, and Wesley Clark has now said it, that Pat Tillman was ordered to be murdered.
[01:08:15.338 --> 01:08:16.118]  Without a doubt.
[01:08:16.918 --> 01:08:19.360]  And finally, two real, real quick stories.
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:20.460]  I mean, killing's the business.
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.501]  Business is good.
[01:08:21.541 --> 01:08:22.121]  This is what they do.
[01:08:23.266 --> 01:08:31.771]  But this soldier that won't be convicted, you know they'll turn him into a police officer and put him out on the street.
[01:08:31.871 --> 01:08:32.651]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:08:33.752 --> 01:08:39.415]  And so that's what we have to look forward to as a civilian community.
[01:08:40.155 --> 01:08:41.576]  But nevertheless... That's right.
[01:08:41.636 --> 01:08:42.416]  Notice that, folks.
[01:08:42.476 --> 01:08:44.557]  The government is now authorities, officials.
[01:08:44.637 --> 01:08:47.699]  We are civilians under the Emergency War Powers Act.
[01:08:47.899 --> 01:08:49.620]  We've been under martial law for a long time.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:51.441]  Now they're just getting around to telling you.
[01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:52.414]  Right.
[01:08:54.856 --> 01:09:06.827]  UPI is also today reporting that once again, heroin out of Afghanistan is... It just keeps breaking records.
[01:09:06.987 --> 01:09:10.370]  One year after the liberation of the drugs, it doubled.
[01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:11.391]  Then it quadrupled.
[01:09:11.691 --> 01:09:12.632]  And now levels of
[01:09:13.452 --> 01:09:19.337]  Once again, that proves that this war on the so-called terrorism is nothing but a hoax.
[01:09:19.357 --> 01:09:25.281]  But my final thing that I'd like to get your analysis on, last week or day after the Montebello Summit wrapped up,
[01:09:39.601 --> 01:09:55.592]  They ran a story in which they mentioned some of the events, but what they did is they mentioned that there were 30 Fortune 500 businesses that attended, but they never mentioned the names of those Fortune 500 businesses.
[01:09:55.632 --> 01:09:56.553]  Absolutely, Rodney.
[01:09:56.573 --> 01:10:03.298]  We got the SPP documents from last year via FOIA request and such, because they did not have the first request.
[01:10:03.318 --> 01:10:04.498]  Judicial Watch did.
[01:10:04.859 --> 01:10:06.740]  Conservative group folks getting these.
[01:10:07.572 --> 01:10:10.134]  And my point is, they were evil when they were attacking Clinton.
[01:10:10.154 --> 01:10:13.556]  Now they're going after Bush, so their conservatives get up on air and say they're bad.
[01:10:14.496 --> 01:10:19.800]  But we were able to find out that it was basically being led by NORFCOM, the new martial law command.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:25.403]  And under that was James Woolsey, the phony conservative trying to get rid of our borders.
[01:10:25.823 --> 01:10:29.686]  And then they had all the Fortune 500 there, literally telling the government ministers what to do.
[01:10:30.359 --> 01:10:36.144]  They were like, this is how you do it, you hand that over, making deals, you give me this, I'll give you that, and it's just, it's for sale!
[01:10:36.164 --> 01:10:37.264]  We're like a third world country!
[01:10:37.585 --> 01:10:39.426]  That's what happens in Africa or Latin America.
[01:10:40.567 --> 01:10:44.470]  The people have gotten mad a lot of those countries, so now it's not as easy for the globalists, they just do it here now.
[01:10:45.411 --> 01:10:51.376]  And they just fly in, land on the private jets, go in, have big meetings, pay off politicians, and they just hand the whole infrastructure over.
[01:10:51.796 --> 01:10:54.798]  It's the same third world deal, they're just doing it right now.
[01:10:55.259 --> 01:10:56.680]  Okay, let's get to another call here.
[01:10:57.875 --> 01:11:00.116]  Uh, let's uh, see who's been holding the longest here.
[01:11:00.216 --> 01:11:02.117]  Michael in Temple.
[01:11:02.598 --> 01:11:03.418]  You're on the air.
[01:11:03.458 --> 01:11:04.539]  Temple, Texas, I believe.
[01:11:04.559 --> 01:11:05.059]  Go ahead.
[01:11:05.719 --> 01:11:06.700]  Hello, uh, Alex.
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:07.500]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:19.626]  Uh, what I wanted to ask you was, uh, the, um, since you have all this information, can you, is there any way that you can, uh, print these names out of these skull and bones people and give them to the public?
[01:11:20.486 --> 01:11:21.387]  Their names and address.
[01:11:22.037 --> 01:11:25.179]  Well, there have been several Skull and Bones lists that have gotten out over the years.
[01:11:25.779 --> 01:11:27.400]  Even Peter Jennings has covered it.
[01:11:28.541 --> 01:11:35.005]  And it's not completely secret who the members are, but they only have 15 members each year.
[01:11:36.016 --> 01:11:42.182]  And so there's only generally a few hundred of them that are living.
[01:11:42.723 --> 01:11:48.028]  But four presidents, most are CIA directors, most are corporate Fortune 500 heads.
[01:11:48.048 --> 01:11:51.771]  I mean, there have been best-selling books written about skull and bones.
[01:11:51.831 --> 01:11:55.234]  I made a film, Order of Death, that is about Bohemian Grove and skull and bones.
[01:11:55.595 --> 01:11:57.456]  And it's only one death cult chapter.
[01:11:57.476 --> 01:11:58.858]  But let me break down what happened.
[01:12:00.099 --> 01:12:00.159]  In 1832,
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:05.803]  The British came in with their opium money, back to heroin.
[01:12:05.903 --> 01:12:10.526]  Of course, heroin wasn't invented until after the Civil War, but my point is, heroin is a derivative of opium.
[01:12:10.546 --> 01:12:14.949]  The point is, opium was legal, and it was making more money in many areas of the U.S.
[01:12:14.969 --> 01:12:15.490]  than alcohol.
[01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:22.715]  But it was a monopoly of the British East India Company, which was consolidated with the Dutch East India at that time.
[01:12:23.328 --> 01:12:26.909]  And so they came in and set up a secret intelligence agency society.
[01:12:27.109 --> 01:12:35.192]  That's why when the OSS at the World War II became the CIA, you heard like the entire leadership, and they've made a movie about it, The Good Shepherd, which is very accurate.
[01:12:35.712 --> 01:12:39.833]  The entire leadership, and it shows them doing a satanic ritual in the movie, because they do that too.
[01:12:40.666 --> 01:12:43.647]  Just to test the little Christian boys and see if they'll do this.
[01:12:43.927 --> 01:12:45.328]  Then they've got to go out and murder people.
[01:12:45.568 --> 01:12:46.769]  It's really a mafia.
[01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:52.631]  You know, just like a local Vato gang's got to go out and bust a cap on some innocent person to become a made man in MS-13.
[01:12:52.891 --> 01:12:55.612]  Well, this is the real wasp mob, boys and girls.
[01:12:56.112 --> 01:13:00.074]  And they get down on their knees to Lucifer, and they beg Lucifer to enter their body.
[01:13:00.134 --> 01:13:02.155]  And whether you believe it or not, this is what they do.
[01:13:02.175 --> 01:13:02.855]  And it's come out.
[01:13:02.915 --> 01:13:07.397]  And Robert De Niro just made a movie about it, you know, with Matt Damon.
[01:13:07.987 --> 01:13:14.989]  And so, I mean, this is the real deal, and this is what they do, and they bring the smack in, they bring the coke in, they run it all!
[01:13:15.549 --> 01:13:16.769]  And that's just the way it is!
[01:13:16.789 --> 01:13:20.510]  When are you going to get more pictures, names, and addresses out to the American people?
[01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:26.851]  Well, listen, I do everything I can, and I'm frankly exhausted from making Endgame and everything else I do.
[01:13:27.271 --> 01:13:32.552]  You can find entire lists in news publications of Skull & Bones members.
[01:13:33.433 --> 01:13:35.033]  Thousands of the names are known.
[01:13:35.832 --> 01:13:39.416]  And George Bush, George Bush Sr., his father Prescott Bush, the Senator.
[01:13:40.117 --> 01:13:42.660]  Now, of course, the Walkers were skull and bones.
[01:13:43.561 --> 01:13:46.304]  I've interviewed Charlotte Isserby, whose dad was skull and bones.
[01:13:46.904 --> 01:13:54.012]  On his deathbed, dying of cancer, he repented and admitted it was satanic, folks.
[01:13:54.551 --> 01:13:56.172]  And said he was ashamed of the things he'd done.
[01:13:56.672 --> 01:14:00.834]  I mean, this is... This is... How do you get young men ready to go out and kill people?
[01:14:01.154 --> 01:14:08.398]  You know, Daddy knows to not come to his 15-year-old and say, By the way, we're drug-dealing Satanists, and we run white slavery out of North Africa.
[01:14:08.618 --> 01:14:10.899]  I mean, this is 200 years ago they were doing this.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.840]  Listen, don't tell Mama.
[01:14:13.701 --> 01:14:18.603]  No, they just bring you and give you to your peers when you're a junior in college.
[01:14:19.278 --> 01:14:24.199]  And they take you in, and they induct you, and they say, we don't worship Jesus, boy, we worship Lucifer!
[01:14:24.499 --> 01:14:31.620]  And then they have older members of Skull and Bones come out, dressed in the black robes, with crowns on their heads, real crowns.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.221]  And they come out, and they're inducted into the Order of Death.
[01:14:35.641 --> 01:14:38.941]  Hitler was a member of the German branch of the Society.
[01:14:39.582 --> 01:14:46.043]  And that's all on the Discovery Channel, on the History Channel, but they won't tell you about what's going on here in the United States.
[01:14:48.875 --> 01:14:50.016]  It's just a test they do.
[01:14:50.916 --> 01:14:54.578]  But those lists are available and are there for you, sir.
[01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:56.379]  Do I have time to go to another call here?
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.040]  Maybe?
[01:14:58.581 --> 01:15:00.122]  Let's go ahead and jam one more in.
[01:15:00.922 --> 01:15:06.165]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brandon, and he's calling from California.
[01:15:06.185 --> 01:15:07.006]  You're on the air, Brandon.
[01:15:07.026 --> 01:15:07.366]  Go ahead.
[01:15:07.386 --> 01:15:09.527]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:15:10.247 --> 01:15:10.428]  Good.
[01:15:10.448 --> 01:15:10.988]  You're on the air.
[01:15:11.068 --> 01:15:11.328]  Hit me.
[01:15:11.748 --> 01:15:14.170]  Yeah, I'm in the Navy here.
[01:15:14.190 --> 01:15:15.891]  I'm out in Lemoore, California.
[01:15:16.741 --> 01:15:18.221]  I've been a long time listener.
[01:15:18.401 --> 01:15:22.662]  I found out about what was going on about a year after I joined the Navy.
[01:15:23.643 --> 01:15:29.084]  I've seen the hit piece on you on the History Channel.
[01:15:29.124 --> 01:15:29.804]  Stay there.
[01:15:29.844 --> 01:15:30.284]  I've got a break.
[01:15:30.304 --> 01:15:31.665]  We're going to come right back to you Brandon.
[01:15:31.685 --> 01:15:32.225]  Don't hang up.
[01:15:32.745 --> 01:15:33.325]  Quick break.
[01:15:33.445 --> 01:15:34.345]  Come back in the next segment.
[01:15:34.365 --> 01:15:35.526]  Get into the History Channel piece.
[01:15:35.846 --> 01:15:36.886]  Talk to Brandon and others.
[01:15:51.195 --> 01:15:59.843]  Did you know that terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:16:00.103 --> 01:16:01.704]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:16:01.945 --> 01:16:04.427]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:16:04.807 --> 01:16:11.493]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne
[01:16:11.613 --> 01:16:12.534]  We're good to go.
[01:16:32.873 --> 01:16:38.499]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:16:38.539 --> 01:16:42.302]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you at 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:16:52.064 --> 01:16:54.045]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:16:54.325 --> 01:16:57.366]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:16:57.646 --> 01:17:02.488]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:17:02.788 --> 01:17:05.569]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:17:05.809 --> 01:17:10.531]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[01:17:10.811 --> 01:17:12.752]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:17:13.212 --> 01:17:23.114]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[01:17:23.474 --> 01:17:28.215]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:17:28.475 --> 01:17:32.036]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:17:32.276 --> 01:17:34.456]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[01:17:34.757 --> 01:17:36.937]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[01:17:37.117 --> 01:17:38.918]  We'll even refund the shipping charge!
[01:17:39.239 --> 01:17:42.381]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now!
[01:17:42.601 --> 01:17:43.521]  What are you waiting for?

[01:18:07.197 --> 01:18:14.884]  The fact is the liver performs over 500 vital functions in the body from aiding digestion to removing toxins and maintaining good health.

[01:18:41.631 --> 01:18:43.072]  Call toll free 1-800-973-1482 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:18:51.807 --> 01:18:53.188]  This is a special bulletin.
[01:18:53.388 --> 01:18:55.570]  The Holy Tea Club is about ready to launch.
[01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:58.272]  A few founding member positions are still available.
[01:18:58.472 --> 01:19:02.534]  If self-employment income is important to you, go to holyteaclub.com.
[01:19:02.815 --> 01:19:12.201]  Formulated by Dr. Bill Miller, Holy Tea is a unique herbal blend of safe, all-natural ingredients designed to gently cleanse the digestive tract and detoxify the body.
[01:19:12.421 --> 01:19:16.564]  Dr. Miller's Holy Tea may also be used as an element in any weight loss program,
[01:19:16.784 --> 01:19:19.167]  It is much more effective than Chinese green tea.
[01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:33.163]  Also with continued use of holy tea, one may experience clear, healthier and younger looking skin, increased energy, increased mental clarity and focus, a better memory, more resistance to diseases, better overall health, more comfort with the body.
[01:19:33.323 --> 01:19:34.183]  We're good to go.
[01:20:02.794 --> 01:20:05.856]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[01:20:06.637 --> 01:20:08.998]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:12.321 --> 01:20:21.527]  Alright, I want to continue with your phone calls, but I want to spend some time eulogizing my friend, Aaron Ruscha, who died Friday morning in the early morning hours.
[01:20:22.308 --> 01:20:24.109]  Let's go ahead and blast through the rest of your calls.
[01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:27.031]  Going back to Brandon in California.
[01:20:27.852 --> 01:20:31.194]  He said he got in the Navy, and then about a year and a half after, found out about
[01:20:31.969 --> 01:20:33.249]  What's happening with the New World Order?
[01:20:33.289 --> 01:20:39.211]  He said he saw the History Channel hit piece against myself and others that they just air over and over again for the last week, airing again tonight.
[01:20:40.111 --> 01:20:40.691]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:20:41.952 --> 01:20:53.595]  Yeah, I realized they didn't really have a lot of facts against, you know, it was mostly just a lot of, like, playing with your emotions, saying, like,
[01:20:54.810 --> 01:20:58.334]  You know, you're crazy if you believe any of these ideas and stuff.
[01:20:58.654 --> 01:21:10.425]  Well, they would also show a physicist saying it's an inside job and showing how there was thermate, a demolition thermite, and then they would call him a novice.
[01:21:10.465 --> 01:21:18.253]  They'd cut to James Maggs, who is the editor of Popular Mechanics, before that edited a video rental magazine.
[01:21:19.139 --> 01:21:23.681]  And they cut to some guy who has no expert credentials and they go, expert!
[01:21:24.321 --> 01:21:25.842]  I mean, it was unbelievable!
[01:21:27.663 --> 01:21:29.024]  Yeah, it made me sick.
[01:21:29.424 --> 01:21:31.185]  I've been speaking out a lot.
[01:21:31.325 --> 01:21:35.167]  I'm in the Navy, I'm stationed on this base.
[01:21:35.767 --> 01:21:37.228]  I've told a lot of people about it.
[01:21:40.009 --> 01:21:46.192]  I've got a few people to understand, but most of the
[01:21:47.290 --> 01:21:49.712]  People, you know, try to say I'm crazy or something.
[01:21:49.812 --> 01:21:50.792]  Well, that's good for them.
[01:21:50.892 --> 01:21:53.174]  Just let them take the mercury and the vaccines.
[01:21:53.714 --> 01:21:55.395]  Let them believe the dollar's still strong.
[01:21:55.475 --> 01:21:57.276]  Let them believe getting into debt's good.
[01:21:57.296 --> 01:21:58.697]  Tell them to get some more credit cards.
[01:21:59.298 --> 01:22:02.200]  And tell them it's great that they don't know anything about our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.941]  Look, that's the general public.
[01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:07.583]  The general public literally knows absolutely nothing.
[01:22:08.183 --> 01:22:11.546]  Now, I have to tell you, though, that in the military I find folks that are awake.
[01:22:11.986 --> 01:22:16.569]  Maybe not in the Navy, because they haven't been actually there in Iraq and Afghanistan seeing the lives.
[01:22:17.170 --> 01:22:24.653]  But almost everybody I talk to who gets back, and they show this in polls, we're talking 80% now, was just 70% a year ago, were against the war, and they know it's a lie.
[01:22:24.853 --> 01:22:26.834]  Because they've been there, they've seen the propaganda.
[01:22:28.575 --> 01:22:32.616]  But you're going to find people who don't want to believe you, or don't want to hear from you.
[01:22:32.636 --> 01:22:34.317]  You know, especially if you're young.
[01:22:35.397 --> 01:22:37.258]  It's also, a lot of it is your delivery.
[01:22:39.379 --> 01:22:42.680]  Because if you try to explain all this to people in a soundbite, it's not going to work.
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:43.360]  Even if I try.
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:44.681]  I'm not that articulate, but you know what I mean.
[01:22:45.322 --> 01:22:47.183]  I'm more articulate than some on these issues.
[01:22:47.704 --> 01:22:49.645]  It's better to point them to TerrorStorm.
[01:22:49.745 --> 01:22:54.909]  Say, hey, Google TerrorStorm and watch the video and tell me what you think.
[01:22:55.369 --> 01:22:56.350]  It's really interesting.
[01:22:57.130 --> 01:22:58.191]  Give me your opinion.
[01:22:58.371 --> 01:23:00.112]  They want to tell you their opinion.
[01:23:00.132 --> 01:23:01.113]  They want to feel important.
[01:23:02.254 --> 01:23:03.815]  Basic psychology.
[01:23:04.756 --> 01:23:05.977]  Basic sales technique.
[01:23:05.997 --> 01:23:06.717]  You'll knock, knock.
[01:23:06.777 --> 01:23:07.778]  I have this vacuum cleaner.
[01:23:07.798 --> 01:23:10.740]  Will you let me cut a demonstration?
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.161]  Will you show me what you think of it?
[01:23:13.523 --> 01:23:18.407]  I mean, I won't go knock on doors to sell vacuum cleaners to do that, but I will to bring terrorists to justice.
[01:23:19.048 --> 01:23:22.090]  And I will, on an individual basis, say, what's your opinion of this?
[01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:23.852]  I mean, do you believe this story?
[01:23:24.252 --> 01:23:25.753]  Or did you know there was a U.S.
[01:23:25.793 --> 01:23:27.234]  government plan to carry out 9-11?
[01:23:27.615 --> 01:23:28.415]  Operation Northwoods?
[01:23:28.615 --> 01:23:29.756]  Yeah, why don't you Google it?
[01:23:30.016 --> 01:23:33.279]  It's ABC News, Baltimore Sun, and it came out before 9-11.
[01:23:33.299 --> 01:23:35.661]  Why don't you check it out?
[01:23:36.522 --> 01:23:38.123]  Operation Northwoods, Google it.
[01:23:39.208 --> 01:23:47.053]  And, uh, sometimes I'll be at some demonstration in New York or somewhere else and I'll have like a hundred cops in front of me and I'll just say, Operation Northwoods, Google it, Google it, you're gonna Google it tonight.
[01:23:47.453 --> 01:23:48.934]  I guarantee you they're Googling it tonight.
[01:23:49.414 --> 01:23:50.134]  And they're gonna find it.
[01:23:50.174 --> 01:23:56.778]  They're gonna read how our government said we're gonna hijack jets and bomb DC and commit terror attacks and blame it on foreign imaginary groups and launch World War III!
[01:23:57.939 --> 01:23:58.219]  Okay?
[01:23:58.239 --> 01:23:58.879]  It's real simple.
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:23:59.980]  Real simple.
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:02.501]  Uh, let's go ahead here and take another call.
[01:24:03.342 --> 01:24:07.164]  Uh, let's, uh, go ahead and talk to Mike in New York.
[01:24:07.544 --> 01:24:08.165]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:24:08.245 --> 01:24:08.765]  Thanks for holding.
[01:24:09.409 --> 01:24:10.190]  Alex, how you doing?
[01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.630]  Good.
[01:24:11.691 --> 01:24:13.493]  Uh, I'm actually getting pretty mad now.
[01:24:13.553 --> 01:24:20.578]  Have you heard about this article that's out, that billions in put options are being purchased, that the S&P 500 is going to drop by 922?
[01:24:23.141 --> 01:24:27.104]  No, I have, again, I'm embarrassed to say I've taken four or five days off.
[01:24:28.202 --> 01:24:29.603]  And so I'm out of the loop.
[01:24:29.623 --> 01:24:30.923]  Was that in the mainstream news?
[01:24:31.383 --> 01:24:35.384]  This is a super secret article that's being passed around.
[01:24:35.865 --> 01:24:36.905]  I'll send you the link.
[01:24:36.985 --> 01:24:39.386]  I don't know where to send it to you.
[01:24:39.406 --> 01:24:42.627]  Send it to Aaron because he'll be in the Bright and Early tomorrow reading the email.
[01:24:43.007 --> 01:24:45.007]  Aaron with two A's at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:45.428 --> 01:24:46.748]  But let me just say this.
[01:24:47.308 --> 01:24:51.372]  You have a lot of these speculators who want to drive something down.
[01:24:51.792 --> 01:24:56.856]  They will put the word out on the street because they put the puts on there and they want that to happen.
[01:24:57.136 --> 01:24:58.478]  That type of stuff is really dangerous.
[01:24:58.518 --> 01:24:59.158]  I'll tell you this.
[01:24:59.659 --> 01:25:02.601]  I've never gotten text messages and emails.
[01:25:02.981 --> 01:25:06.124]  I've gotten a few, but I've never gotten them every few hours like I'm getting them now.
[01:25:06.825 --> 01:25:11.288]  There is just propaganda being flooded, saying the market's going up, the market's going down.
[01:25:11.308 --> 01:25:13.170]  There's so much speculation going on right now.
[01:25:14.262 --> 01:25:15.423]  I just know this.
[01:25:15.463 --> 01:25:16.843]  Get out of the market first.
[01:25:16.883 --> 01:25:19.584]  ...by a lot of people that, real quick, let me just give you that.
[01:25:19.604 --> 01:25:21.725]  S&P 500's at, I don't know, $1,200.
[01:25:22.105 --> 01:25:24.786]  But they have an option to buy at $7.
[01:25:25.606 --> 01:25:30.628]  And these are like $5 billion options for it to collapse and then for them to buy at $700.
[01:25:30.688 --> 01:25:32.709]  Yeah, but I mean, who's circulating them?
[01:25:33.129 --> 01:25:33.769]  What's the name of the group?
[01:25:33.789 --> 01:25:39.431]  No, but what I'm saying is, if it don't happen, the premium on their options, they're going to lose over a billion dollars.
[01:25:39.651 --> 01:25:40.932]  So no one in their right mind
[01:25:41.787 --> 01:25:43.928]  It's gonna lose that much money if it don't happen.
[01:25:43.948 --> 01:25:47.770]  No, no, listen, I hear you, sir, but I was, I kept asking you, who's putting it out?
[01:25:47.850 --> 01:25:51.191]  If someone won't put their name on it, it is more than suspect.
[01:25:51.271 --> 01:25:52.332]  It's super suspect.
[01:25:52.812 --> 01:25:53.152]  Okay?
[01:25:54.293 --> 01:25:57.574]  You see, this is the world of manipulation and rumors.
[01:25:57.814 --> 01:26:01.476]  When you start getting into somebody claims in a secret email, this is gonna happen.
[01:26:02.987 --> 01:26:05.208]  Or somebody claims San Diego is going to be attacked.
[01:26:05.268 --> 01:26:07.809]  Or somebody claims New Orleans is going to be attacked.
[01:26:07.849 --> 01:26:09.750]  Or somebody claims San Francisco is going to be attacked.
[01:26:10.151 --> 01:26:14.053]  On this date, that is really suspect when you see that.
[01:26:14.773 --> 01:26:17.134]  When you see that type of thing go on, that type of thing happen.
[01:26:20.955 --> 01:26:26.140]  That's all I can really say on that issue, so I'm not going to spread that type of information here on this show.
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:33.126]  What I do know is there were put options against American and United Airlines at record levels.
[01:26:33.487 --> 01:26:35.048]  They had never been placed at this level.
[01:26:35.809 --> 01:26:44.817]  When the airlines were riding high and had good news coming up, these were dumb, dumb conventional put options betting the stock was going to go down.
[01:26:46.585 --> 01:26:51.168]  And they were placed for September 11th and 12th in the four days running up to it.
[01:26:52.469 --> 01:26:56.831]  Now, by the way, FBI agents went to jail for this, but these were billions in put options.
[01:26:57.211 --> 01:27:02.094]  They went and busted two local New York guys to try to claim that they had done it all.
[01:27:02.715 --> 01:27:06.037]  And then it was kept very quiet, but it was in one or two New York newspapers.
[01:27:06.057 --> 01:27:08.398]  It was in one news wire and one newspaper, if memory serves.
[01:27:09.499 --> 01:27:15.923]  But the real put options went back to Buzzy Krongaard, Executive Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:27:16.183 --> 01:27:19.025]  And that came out in major newspapers in Germany.
[01:27:20.666 --> 01:27:26.269]  Major newspapers in Germany, major newspapers, mentioned it here in the United States.
[01:27:28.451 --> 01:27:29.952]  So were there put options?
[01:27:30.192 --> 01:27:31.453]  Absolutely, right before 9-11.
[01:27:33.533 --> 01:27:34.073]  Absolutely.
[01:27:34.093 --> 01:27:35.513]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:27:35.973 --> 01:27:40.174]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Cliff in Idaho.
[01:27:40.214 --> 01:27:41.254]  Cliff, you're on the air.
[01:27:41.334 --> 01:27:41.915]  Thanks for holding.
[01:27:42.375 --> 01:27:42.995]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:27:43.015 --> 01:27:43.215]  Good, sir.
[01:27:43.255 --> 01:27:45.475]  Thanks for the good work that you're doing.
[01:27:45.855 --> 01:27:47.616]  I've got three real important things to tell you.
[01:27:47.676 --> 01:27:51.416]  I'm the one that got Joanne Wood from the Department of Transportation in Boise.
[01:27:51.436 --> 01:27:53.377]  She's our state representative.
[01:27:53.437 --> 01:27:56.077]  I got her on the Probing America 1260 AM.
[01:27:56.857 --> 01:28:00.678]  Now, I've been conversing with her and sending her information, you know, on the SPP.
[01:28:01.935 --> 01:28:06.319]  Is there any way I can get the copy of the minutes that they had up there?
[01:28:07.159 --> 01:28:08.460]  You say you have a computer?
[01:28:09.501 --> 01:28:09.882]  Oh yes!
[01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:16.107]  Okay, let me answer your question on how to get the minutes from the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[01:28:17.027 --> 01:28:19.629]  If you go to judicialwatch.org
[01:28:21.758 --> 01:28:30.763]  You can click on their filings, and you can spend maybe two or three minutes there, and you will find the minutes from the SPP.
[01:28:31.143 --> 01:28:38.908]  They're also in Dr. Korsey's The Late Great USA, now New York Times Bestseller, which we by the way have at InfoWars.com for you, if you'd like to order it there.
[01:28:40.208 --> 01:28:42.289]  And he has copies of some of the key documents in there.
[01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:50.454]  But, I mean it just takes some, in fact if you type in SPP BAMF,
[01:28:51.451 --> 01:28:52.091]  Documents.
[01:28:53.112 --> 01:28:55.693]  SPP BAMF Documents.
[01:28:55.733 --> 01:28:57.533]  Or SPP Documents.
[01:28:58.914 --> 01:29:00.774]  SPP Minutes.
[01:29:01.114 --> 01:29:02.275]  Let me just do it right now.
[01:29:02.355 --> 01:29:04.816]  Let me just illustrate this to everybody.
[01:29:05.496 --> 01:29:06.036]  Right here.
[01:29:07.597 --> 01:29:08.057]  Right now.
[01:29:08.157 --> 01:29:08.637]  Here on air.
[01:29:08.717 --> 01:29:09.537]  I'm going to go to break.
[01:29:09.997 --> 01:29:14.379]  And I'm going to come back and I'm going to find the actual URL for this for everybody.
[01:29:14.579 --> 01:29:17.160]  Because I probably get five emails a day saying, give me the documents.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:17.940]  Give me the documents.
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:20.101]  The documents are right there and available.
[01:29:23.217 --> 01:29:30.219]  We're going to talk to Eric when we get back, maybe one or two others, and then we'll talk about Aaron Russo in the closing minutes of this broadcast.
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:31.620]  Stay with us.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:39.362]  The final segment is straight ahead, and I've got an interesting program note as well on the other side, so stay with us.
[01:29:52.395 --> 01:30:00.738]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.

[01:30:11.441 --> 01:30:17.286]  Zero in on man-made disaster zones, environmental areas of concern, and natural disaster zones.
[01:30:17.507 --> 01:30:21.950]  Find out everything from where to get water in an emergency to geographic income levels.
[01:30:22.171 --> 01:30:28.256]  Housing crisis, complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on the 3,000 plus counties in the U.S.
[01:30:28.416 --> 01:30:29.477]  Full color photographs.
[01:30:29.677 --> 01:30:29.957]  Hi neighbor.
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:55.562]  But you don't know can hurt you.
[01:30:55.882 --> 01:30:58.084]  What if your home value crashed below what you owe?
[01:30:58.184 --> 01:31:02.628]  Do you know that you can be made to pay off the entire balance to keep your home even if you're paid ahead?
[01:31:03.288 --> 01:31:09.013]  What if your crazy Uncle Fred who drives you nuts screaming, there's gonna be no food, was right?
[01:31:09.774 --> 01:31:10.795]  Do you know he already is?
[01:31:11.816 --> 01:31:16.740]  What if bankruptcy laws change student to non-collateral loans to permanent unforgivable debts?
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.441]  Do you know they already have?
[01:31:19.102 --> 01:31:20.363]  You either pay or go to prison.
[01:31:21.317 --> 01:31:21.937]  Good news.
[01:31:22.017 --> 01:31:25.078]  It's now safe for you to discover the problems you didn't know about.
[01:31:25.999 --> 01:31:26.899]  Fearless Radio.
[01:31:27.439 --> 01:31:28.840]  You are no longer a victim.
[01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:32.701]  This Sunday, an interview that you'll never forget.
[01:31:33.581 --> 01:31:37.643]  It's just after Alex on GCN at 6 p.m.
[01:31:37.743 --> 01:31:38.443]  Central Time.
[01:31:39.123 --> 01:31:39.563]  Be there.
[01:31:39.884 --> 01:31:40.744]  Who am I?
[01:31:41.404 --> 01:31:41.824]  Nobody.
[01:31:42.404 --> 01:31:43.545]  Just Steve Shank.
[01:31:43.625 --> 01:31:44.665]  Someone who cares.
[01:31:45.205 --> 01:31:45.766]  Don't forget.
[01:31:45.786 --> 01:31:46.186]  6 p.m.
[01:31:51.795 --> 01:31:53.676]  Bill, this is a special bulletin.
[01:31:53.856 --> 01:31:56.036]  The Holy Tea Club is about ready to launch.
[01:31:56.236 --> 01:31:58.757]  A few founding member positions are still available.
[01:31:58.937 --> 01:32:03.018]  If self-employment income is important to you, go to holyteaclub.com.
[01:32:03.278 --> 01:32:12.661]  Formulated by Dr. Bill Miller, Holy Tea is a unique herbal blend of safe, all-natural ingredients designed to gently cleanse the digestive tract and detoxify the body.
[01:32:12.881 --> 01:32:17.022]  Dr. Miller's Holy Tea may also be used as an element in any weight loss program,
[01:32:17.262 --> 01:32:19.644]  It is much more effective than Chinese green tea.
[01:32:19.864 --> 01:32:33.652]  Also with continued use of holy tea, one may experience clear, healthier, and younger looking skin, increased energy, increased mental clarity and focus, a better memory, more resistance to diseases, better overall health, more comfort with the body.
[01:32:33.852 --> 01:32:37.714]  Did you know that we ingest toxins and harsh chemicals every day from the foods and alcohol we consume?
[01:32:56.581 --> 01:33:00.223]  The water we drink and the OTCs and prescription medications we take.
[01:33:00.503 --> 01:33:06.726]  Thankfully, our liver neutralizes the effects of these toxins and eliminates them from our bodies before they can do too much damage.
[01:33:06.986 --> 01:33:14.670]  The fact is, the liver performs over 500 vital functions in the body, from aiding digestion to removing toxins and maintaining good health.
[01:33:14.951 --> 01:33:16.932]  So why not give your liver the help it needs?
[01:33:17.152 --> 01:33:22.675]  With LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula, prescribed by more than 200,000 doctors
[01:33:23.855 --> 01:33:23.995]  Right.
[01:33:57.352 --> 01:33:58.974]  Alright, final segment.
[01:33:58.994 --> 01:34:03.518]  It literally took me 15 seconds.
[01:34:17.492 --> 01:34:19.493]  To find the Judicial Watch documents.
[01:34:19.533 --> 01:34:23.875]  Now, I knew we'd save them and put them on PleasantPlanet.com and Infowars.com as well.
[01:34:24.475 --> 01:34:30.478]  But I wanted to give you the group that had actually done the work and filed the FOIA request, and we didn't get them, the law search.
[01:34:31.699 --> 01:34:35.540]  I typed into Google, Judicial Watch.
[01:34:36.681 --> 01:34:38.182]  One word or two, it works either way.
[01:34:40.002 --> 01:34:43.424]  And the letters SPP together.
[01:34:44.261 --> 01:34:47.303]  Judicial Watch Space SPP.
[01:34:47.844 --> 01:34:48.484]  Top link.
[01:34:49.145 --> 01:34:49.885]  Pops up.
[01:34:50.946 --> 01:34:54.709]  Judicial Watch releases details on Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:56.050]  Now you click on that.
[01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:57.071]  They got the official U.S.
[01:34:57.091 --> 01:34:58.132]  government maps on it.
[01:34:58.452 --> 01:35:02.035]  On the map of superhighways that the fake neocons on air say don't exist.
[01:35:02.355 --> 01:35:03.596]  Again, they're there to neutralize you.
[01:35:03.636 --> 01:35:05.037]  Make sure you don't wake up and fight them.
[01:35:05.377 --> 01:35:06.278]  Make sure it's too late.
[01:35:06.318 --> 01:35:07.779]  Make sure the globalists get the takeover.
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:09.461]  They get their talking points.
[01:35:09.481 --> 01:35:10.361]  Get their marching orders.
[01:35:10.401 --> 01:35:11.182]  Just like the liberals do.
[01:35:11.222 --> 01:35:12.343]  It's totally controlled.
[01:35:13.311 --> 01:35:16.273]  Roger Ailes, Fox News is behind Hillary, it's all staged.
[01:35:17.054 --> 01:35:19.996]  And you just go ahead and scroll down and it just says the whole history.
[01:35:20.036 --> 01:35:26.942]  Judicial Watch Files Lawsuit, Sheik's Access to Security and Prosperity Partnership, Advisory Groups, Meetings and Records, August 10th.
[01:35:27.422 --> 01:35:32.386]  Judicial Watch, Sheik's Access, North American Competitiveness Council Meetings, under Federal Open Meetings Law.
[01:35:33.387 --> 01:35:35.789]  All the filings right down to all the documents they've gotten.
[01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:38.311]  And oh, looks like they've gotten some new stuff here.
[01:35:38.431 --> 01:35:38.651]  Hmm.
[01:35:39.571 --> 01:35:42.333]  So, uh, you can go read thousands of pages if you'd like.
[01:35:42.754 --> 01:35:45.756]  The key ones, though, are the BAMP Canada meetings.
[01:35:45.776 --> 01:35:47.057]  There's only a couple hundred of those.
[01:35:47.357 --> 01:35:47.817]  Go read them.
[01:35:48.078 --> 01:35:48.958]  Makes for interesting reading.
[01:35:48.978 --> 01:35:50.259]  Okay, there it is.
[01:35:50.559 --> 01:35:52.141]  Judicial Watch SPP.
[01:35:52.421 --> 01:35:56.624]  Then you can call Medved or Hannity or any of these traders and go, Hey, scumbag!
[01:35:56.924 --> 01:35:58.826]  I have the official certified U.S.
[01:35:58.866 --> 01:36:04.770]  government documents, stamped Homeland Security on them, saying that they're taking over the U.S.
[01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:06.071]  and don't let the people know.
[01:36:06.392 --> 01:36:08.253]  They actually say in here, keep it secret.
[01:36:09.278 --> 01:36:09.778]  Okay?
[01:36:10.038 --> 01:36:11.759]  Shut up, you fake neocons!
[01:36:11.959 --> 01:36:13.279]  I've had it with you, you traitors!
[01:36:14.899 --> 01:36:16.780]  Real fast, Eric, last caller.
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:19.220]  I don't even know where Eric's calling from.
[01:36:19.261 --> 01:36:20.501]  He might as well be calling from the moon.
[01:36:20.521 --> 01:36:21.041]  You're on the air, Eric.
[01:36:21.061 --> 01:36:21.921]  Where are you calling from?
[01:36:22.441 --> 01:36:25.122]  Hey, Alex, I'm calling from southbound I-35.
[01:36:25.462 --> 01:36:28.563]  I got two questions, if you'll let me get them out.
[01:36:28.603 --> 01:36:29.103]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:36:30.276 --> 01:36:34.679]  Number one, I want to ask you sequentially, so please don't interrupt me.
[01:36:34.859 --> 01:36:35.800]  Okay, I'm letting you go.
[01:36:36.281 --> 01:36:36.881]  How do you like that?
[01:36:36.901 --> 01:36:37.822]  How do you like that?
[01:36:37.842 --> 01:36:38.202]  You're off.
[01:36:38.742 --> 01:36:52.533]  I got ten minutes, I got a dead friend I want to talk about, and you little neocons that call in and push up a shnivel and tell me the rules, and you're the teacher, and you have all the answers, and you're gonna tell me how the world works.
[01:36:52.913 --> 01:36:53.153]  No!
[01:36:53.473 --> 01:36:56.996]  I put you on air, we need to screen your call like you're neocon masters.
[01:36:57.589 --> 01:36:59.389]  Okay, and you had to be the boss first.
[01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:00.890]  So you're off the air.
[01:37:00.930 --> 01:37:02.250]  That's just the end of it, sir.
[01:37:02.290 --> 01:37:03.070]  We're not going to talk to you.
[01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:07.971]  You can call back next week, earlier in the show if you want, when we have time, and I'll get you on air if you'd like then.
[01:37:08.452 --> 01:37:12.333]  Okay, but I'm not going to sit there still while you tell me to shut up for ten hours.
[01:37:12.693 --> 01:37:13.013]  Okay?
[01:37:13.953 --> 01:37:16.734]  You can call into other shows and say SPP doesn't exist.
[01:37:17.114 --> 01:37:19.434]  You can call in and say there's no North American Union.
[01:37:19.634 --> 01:37:24.015]  You can call in other shows and say there's no Goldberg and say I wear a tinfoil hat and giggle and snicker.
[01:37:24.355 --> 01:37:24.655]  Okay?
[01:37:26.056 --> 01:37:26.456]  Alright.
[01:37:27.918 --> 01:37:32.702]  You want to read a blow-by-blow breakdown of the lies of the History Channel.
[01:37:32.722 --> 01:37:33.723]  We've only covered some of them.
[01:37:33.783 --> 01:37:36.585]  It's taken about five articles, but some of them are very lengthy.
[01:37:36.645 --> 01:37:39.908]  But we document each lie, and then more pieces are coming out.
[01:37:41.269 --> 01:37:45.192]  History Channel hit piece, Dirty Tricks, Malicious Lies, and Journalistic Fraud.
[01:37:45.212 --> 01:37:46.012]  You can go read that.
[01:37:46.373 --> 01:37:50.496]  The real story behind Brad Davis, NBC, Popular Mechanics, and the History Channel.
[01:37:50.836 --> 01:37:56.601]  Media whore excuses who engage in deliberate deception, manipulation, and chicanery to please their corporate
[01:37:57.333 --> 01:37:57.813]  Bosses.
[01:37:57.833 --> 01:37:58.494]  That's one article.
[01:37:58.514 --> 01:37:58.874]  Another one.
[01:37:59.114 --> 01:38:01.435]  History Channel expert spins conspiracy yarn.
[01:38:02.136 --> 01:38:02.816]  Here's another one.
[01:38:03.216 --> 01:38:08.579]  History Channel fraudsters pass off joke website as representative of 9-11 truth.
[01:38:08.599 --> 01:38:12.502]  So those are just some of the articles you can go read there up on the site.
[01:38:13.662 --> 01:38:14.122]  Alright!
[01:38:14.743 --> 01:38:15.843]  One more program note.
[01:38:15.903 --> 01:38:20.326]  I'm going to be showing Endgame, which will not be out on DVD until mid-October.
[01:38:21.269 --> 01:38:23.431]  This film is now being mastered.
[01:38:24.332 --> 01:38:26.955]  The DVD is being pressed and coded right now.
[01:38:26.995 --> 01:38:28.116]  It won't be out until October.
[01:38:28.797 --> 01:38:33.262]  You can see it at four limited engagements in Texas before then.
[01:38:33.542 --> 01:38:39.769]  The 4th, 5th, 6th, and then I come back from New York, the 17th at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[01:38:41.016 --> 01:38:43.317]  You can go to InfoWars.com and link through and get tickets.
[01:38:44.138 --> 01:38:50.060]  Or you can watch it in New York on the night and go to WeAreChange.org and find out the details about that.
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:55.643]  I'm giving all the proceeds to the firemen and police through WeAreChange and the Feel Good Foundation.
[01:38:56.043 --> 01:38:57.224]  So, that's there.
[01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:58.404]  You can also see it in New York.
[01:38:58.424 --> 01:38:59.965]  I don't know the details, so just go find out.
[01:39:00.484 --> 01:39:15.349]  But again, if you want to see this film, the film that is the most powerful, most out of control, most unbelievable I've ever made, who runs the New World Order, who the globalists are, how they operate, their plan to exterminate 80% of the population, totally documented, literal nightmare, folks.
[01:39:15.409 --> 01:39:16.890]  It's freaking me out right now, okay?
[01:39:18.010 --> 01:39:18.691]  Just, I hate it.
[01:39:18.851 --> 01:39:19.811]  I hate what's happening.
[01:39:19.851 --> 01:39:20.631]  I can't stand it.
[01:39:20.751 --> 01:39:23.212]  I wish it wasn't reality, okay?
[01:39:23.792 --> 01:39:25.113]  Reality's bad, okay?
[01:39:26.306 --> 01:39:28.787]  The people that created Hitler are running things right now.
[01:39:28.987 --> 01:39:30.108]  They created the Bolsheviks.
[01:39:30.328 --> 01:39:31.768]  They don't play games, alright?
[01:39:32.309 --> 01:39:33.369]  They love killing people.
[01:39:36.130 --> 01:39:38.951]  Alright, my good friend.
[01:39:40.172 --> 01:39:41.932]  I've interviewed him so many times over the years.
[01:39:42.473 --> 01:39:48.475]  Going back when he ran for Libertarian, for President, even back when he ran for Governor of Nevada, and came very close to winning.
[01:39:50.116 --> 01:39:52.777]  And so I feel like I knew him, but I never met him until
[01:39:53.783 --> 01:39:56.244]  What was it, January of this year?
[01:39:56.264 --> 01:39:58.785]  I talked to him on the phone.
[01:39:58.825 --> 01:40:03.646]  He said there was a good chance that he was going to die, but he was fighting cancer almost five years into it then.
[01:40:05.907 --> 01:40:07.427]  He'd had all these surgeries and the rest of it.
[01:40:07.447 --> 01:40:08.928]  A really tough guy, a normal person.
[01:40:09.348 --> 01:40:11.488]  Aaron Russo was an arm wrestling champion.
[01:40:12.069 --> 01:40:14.409]  He brought some of the biggest rock bands in U.S.
[01:40:14.429 --> 01:40:19.871]  history like Led Zeppelin, The Hood of the U.S., The Doors when they were unknown.
[01:40:21.644 --> 01:40:22.565]  I don't know.
[01:40:37.166 --> 01:40:40.368]  Uh, and about 15 years ago started fighting them valiantly.
[01:40:40.388 --> 01:40:46.491]  And he made America Freedom to Fascism, didn't tell anybody that he was three years into battling cancer when he started making it.
[01:40:47.031 --> 01:40:51.554]  I mean, this guy was in all sorts of therapy, surgeries, uh, could hardly get out of bed.
[01:40:51.574 --> 01:40:54.375]  He would make himself go into the interviews and fly all over the country.
[01:40:54.875 --> 01:41:02.439]  He made America Freedom to Fascism, a great documentary about the private Federal Reserve and the whole New World Order system, and the North American Union.
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:05.141]  And, uh, Aaron, uh, died.
[01:41:06.159 --> 01:41:16.182]  Out in Los Angeles at the hospital, he died at about four in the morning of complications from his ongoing battle with cancer.
[01:41:16.922 --> 01:41:19.463]  And he almost died a few months ago and told me on the phone.
[01:41:20.223 --> 01:41:24.404]  And there were all these other people with the organizations, a few of the groups he set up.
[01:41:27.005 --> 01:41:29.626]  I remember telling him, I was like, look, man, he's not long for this world.
[01:41:29.666 --> 01:41:30.466]  He hadn't told you that?
[01:41:31.086 --> 01:41:33.187]  And they were like, no, he hadn't told us that.
[01:41:33.207 --> 01:41:34.527]  And I was like, yeah, this is serious.
[01:41:35.722 --> 01:41:39.466]  But I'm really surprised he lasted as long as he did.
[01:41:40.006 --> 01:41:41.087]  We wrote a little eulogy.
[01:41:41.107 --> 01:41:42.728]  We actually wrote a little bit of it.
[01:41:42.768 --> 01:41:46.432]  We grabbed what we had changed and put out and added it to our eulogy.
[01:41:47.573 --> 01:41:51.696]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now if you want to read it.
[01:41:51.756 --> 01:41:54.178]  Patriot hero Aaron Russo passes away.
[01:41:54.198 --> 01:42:01.905]  We were saddened to hear that the passing of activist, filmmaker, freedom fighter, and all around maverick Aaron Russo today, who died
[01:42:03.857 --> 01:42:16.481]  After a long battle with cancer at the age of 64, Aaron will be remembered finally for all of his achievements, not least of which the excellent America from Freedom to Fascism, his final movie which exposed the fraudulent basis of the IRS and the Federal Reserve.
[01:42:16.861 --> 01:42:20.742]  Aaron was a real patriot who loved his country and risked his whole career to stand for truth.
[01:42:21.002 --> 01:42:22.263]  He was an example to all of us.
[01:42:22.283 --> 01:42:25.203]  Aaron Russo was the Samuel Adams of our day.
[01:42:27.481 --> 01:42:30.123]  I think that's accurate, and that's my line I put in there.
[01:42:30.543 --> 01:42:41.709]  A stalwart defender of liberty, his passion is greatly mourned, but his fiery spirit lives on in all of his great work, and in his wife, his children, and his film, America, Freedom, and Fascism.
[01:42:42.029 --> 01:42:46.172]  Our deep condolences go out to Aaron's family and friends at this difficult time.
[01:42:47.132 --> 01:42:54.777]  Below is a video interview that I conducted with Aaron after we were finally able to meet for the first time in January.
[01:42:55.467 --> 01:42:56.408]  of this year.
[01:42:57.588 --> 01:42:58.809]  Happy 12th, my friend.
[01:42:59.630 --> 01:43:03.632]  Aaron has made the jump into hyperspace.
[01:43:03.893 --> 01:43:08.135]  I do believe that there is life after death, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:08.896 --> 01:43:11.537]  I believe that Aaron is in a better place.
[01:43:12.918 --> 01:43:14.699]  He was just an amazing person.
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:16.160]  A lovely person.
[01:43:16.581 --> 01:43:17.401]  Had a big heart.
[01:43:17.521 --> 01:43:19.743]  He was a fighter.
[01:43:19.803 --> 01:43:24.746]  Not many people can make a good film, much less make a film while you're fighting for your life against cancer.
[01:43:26.056 --> 01:43:29.759]  I mean, he almost died a few times while he was making America Freedom to Fascism, he told me.
[01:43:30.259 --> 01:43:31.760]  He didn't want anybody to know that on record.
[01:43:32.081 --> 01:43:34.622]  He didn't like to whine about his very serious illness.
[01:43:35.143 --> 01:43:45.250]  I'm not going to get into, when I saw him in January, how bad off he was, folks, but he was... I mean, I saw death in his eyes then, as I saw in both my grandfathers right before they died.
[01:43:45.971 --> 01:43:48.452]  And, uh, you know, he was fighting as hard as he could.
[01:43:48.472 --> 01:43:49.533]  Just an amazing individual.
[01:43:50.174 --> 01:43:53.116]  He had cancer all throughout his chest and stomach and
[01:43:53.795 --> 01:43:54.375]  I don't think so.
[01:44:23.084 --> 01:44:28.931]  Take his great example, standing up and fighting for freedom, and standing up for liberty, and standing up against tyranny.
[01:44:29.291 --> 01:44:31.073]  We're going to always remember you, Aaron Reeso.
[01:44:31.534 --> 01:44:38.702]  So, my friend, again, we salute you, and we know now that you are in Valhalla, so God bless you.

[01:45:18.431 --> 01:45:21.592]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
