[00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.130]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:07.871]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.572 --> 00:00:09.693]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.154]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:12.775]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:17.078]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.658 --> 00:00:21.741]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.144 --> 00:00:39.326]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th day of May 2007.
[00:00:40.447 --> 00:00:42.849]  We'll be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:44.910]  We have Jim Tucker.
[00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:53.356]  Jim Tucker of American Free Paris joining us for our customary early to mid-May interview.
[00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:59.780]  As he tries to give us any intelligence he's gleaned on when the upcoming Bilderberg Group meeting may be held.
[00:01:00.743 --> 00:01:09.691]  It is generally held in late May or early June, more often in the first 10 days of June, but occasionally in late May.
[00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:17.978]  And we've got several rumored locations from Istanbul, Turkey to Evian, France.
[00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.501]  We will be discussing it all.
[00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:27.767]  The world leaders and the royalties, representatives as well as royalty, meeting to set the year's agenda.
[00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.254]  So that's coming up in the second hour with Jim Tucker.
[00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:42.886]  He's been covering Bilderberg for more than 30 years and has been to, what, 27 of the meetings physically and even been shot at!
[00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:46.322]  I feel like I know Jim even better than I do.
[00:01:46.363 --> 00:01:58.270]  I've been interviewing him for 12 years and I've gone to Bilderberg with him and attended it and covered it with him, but for the last 6-8 months I've been editing video of him in high definition on a big screen.
[00:02:00.952 --> 00:02:03.314]  So I know every crick and cranny of Jim's face.
[00:02:03.774 --> 00:02:06.496]  What a character, what an icon, what a patriot.
[00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:10.279]  Just a Virginia cotton farmer.
[00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:11.379]  That's where he came from.
[00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:11.900]  Good person.
[00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:17.842]  Well, I've got a lot of important news here.
[00:02:17.862 --> 00:02:19.682]  Interesting little tidbits like this.
[00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:31.925]  You know, I don't even cover it now when major scientific reports come out on a daily basis that cell phone towers and cell phones are causing massive brain tumors and are extremely dangerous.
[00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.245]  I still use mine.
[00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:35.005]  I got in the habit of using it.
[00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:38.506]  The globalists know how to control us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:39.227 --> 00:02:40.527]  And so I'm not putting you down.
[00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:41.908]  We're all dying together.
[00:02:41.968 --> 00:02:43.068]  We're all scum together.
[00:02:43.108 --> 00:02:44.168]  We're all foolish together.
[00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:53.391]  But one thing that I do not allow is more than one hour of television a week with my children, though the major studies are showing that's bad.
[00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:57.432]  TV toddlers become aggressive.
[00:02:57.472 --> 00:03:00.033]  London Telegraph will be going over that.
[00:03:00.093 --> 00:03:07.495]  Speaking of television, with shades of The Running Man, Chinese TV programming replaced with anti-regime slogans
[00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:14.687]  We'll be going over this as the rebellion against dehumanization and tyranny intensifies in China.
[00:03:16.568 --> 00:03:21.769]  Those people, I'm beginning to really admire the people resisting over in Asia.
[00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:24.890]  They know tyranny over there and they're willing to fight.
[00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.831]  And I just wish we had more of that spirit over here in the land of the free and home of the brave.
[00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:34.194]  Also, Troop Squad questions John Edwards about WTC7.
[00:03:34.594 --> 00:03:35.475]  That's coming up later.
[00:03:35.995 --> 00:03:38.757]  And another congresswoman was confronted about it.
[00:03:39.137 --> 00:03:40.498]  And a congressman.
[00:03:40.518 --> 00:03:41.759]  So, three different clips.
[00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.220]  If we have time, we'll be playing those.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.801]  We'll play at least the Edwards clip.
[00:03:45.982 --> 00:03:47.363]  We'll play the Grill Halva clip, too.
[00:03:47.423 --> 00:03:47.964]  It's pretty bad.
[00:03:52.094 --> 00:04:03.841]  Again, I cannot stress enough how big it is that Bruce Willis has gone public, not just on JFK being an inside job, but very close to going public on 9-11.
[00:04:04.862 --> 00:04:06.863]  And we told you this eight, nine months ago.
[00:04:06.903 --> 00:04:07.844]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:04:08.644 --> 00:04:10.245]  Now it is mainstream news.
[00:04:10.405 --> 00:04:11.426]  New developments there.
[00:04:11.926 --> 00:04:21.572]  We'll be going over a detailed report up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com titled, From Unlikely Quarters, Bruce Willis Ends the JFK Debate.
[00:04:23.957 --> 00:04:27.438]  And World Bank panel finds Wolfowitz at fault in aid.
[00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:31.479]  And a major aide resigns there.
[00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:33.120]  We'll tell you what's going on behind the scenes.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.802]  But first, I'm going to try to control myself and not have a convulsion on air.
[00:04:39.482 --> 00:04:53.306]  The Queen openly treats the President like a rhesus monkey in her lap on the world scene as our presidency is drug through the mud by that by that inbred
[00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.033]  Dumb down, sloth of a woman, looks like an old man in drag, whore Elizabeth!
[00:05:00.293 --> 00:05:00.913]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.594 --> 00:05:09.698]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.058 --> 00:05:17.702]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:25.448]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.848 --> 00:05:37.253]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.593 --> 00:05:41.095]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.535 --> 00:05:43.476]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.816 --> 00:05:47.658]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:04.568 --> 00:06:07.429]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:13.853]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[00:07:00.908 --> 00:07:03.849]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:09.170]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.831]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:16.352]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:16.712 --> 00:07:25.714]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:07:26.034 --> 00:07:27.636]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.
[00:07:27.876 --> 00:07:32.041]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:07:56.197 --> 00:08:01.279]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.640]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.001]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.057 --> 00:08:28.483]  Up until just about 30 seconds ago, I'd only had a chance to read about the exchange.
[00:08:29.924 --> 00:08:40.793]  We have now found the video online, and I also just had a chance to see the exchange happen on CNN during the break as I was triple-tasking.
[00:08:42.334 --> 00:08:43.355]  What am I speaking of?
[00:08:44.406 --> 00:08:57.872]  Well, I want an article written about this, and it needs to be written by our British counterparts, our English counterparts, Paul Watson or Steve Watson, because they have a unique perspective on this, and I know they detest Her Majesty even more than I do.
[00:09:01.454 --> 00:09:13.440]  In fact, the monarchy had become extremely unpopular in the last 200 years in England, and even more so in the last 50 years, but now they've been trying to rehabilitate themselves in part of a larger
[00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:17.009]  A very sophisticated package of propaganda.
[00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:28.555]  But as much as I detest Bush, who is, of course, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth on both sides of his family.
[00:09:28.595 --> 00:09:30.636]  It's all royal breeding bloodlines.
[00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:32.838]  Again, that's been covered by MSNBC.
[00:09:33.438 --> 00:09:35.019]  Then, of course, Kerry and Bush are cousins.
[00:09:35.079 --> 00:09:40.542]  It's all a blue-blood, filthy nest that basically runs things.
[00:09:42.904 --> 00:09:48.626]  There was this big hubbub about, would Bush curtsy properly to Her Majesty?
[00:09:48.666 --> 00:09:51.827]  Would he wait for her to extend her hand?
[00:09:52.007 --> 00:10:10.232]  Would he be a well-trained dog and take her mitt and properly subjugate himself and prostrate himself before her hereditary wickedness?
[00:10:12.703 --> 00:10:19.307]  And, uh, Bush, of course, is so into the fake Texas act that he adopted as a young man.
[00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:26.532]  Uh, favorite movie, High Noon, did run around until he was a teenager in the cowboy hat and fake guns at his side.
[00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:27.733]  Very juvenile.
[00:10:27.753 --> 00:10:33.457]  Um, that he just couldn't control himself and winked at her and joked with her and made jokes.
[00:10:34.257 --> 00:10:41.202]  Which, as much as I dislike Bush, you've gotta... I don't know, I mean, his stock went up about one micron with me.
[00:10:42.126 --> 00:10:51.894]  Because at least he didn't sit there and make himself a pathetic spectacle before this nothing individual.
[00:10:55.337 --> 00:10:57.218]  Ronald Reagan didn't do it either.
[00:10:57.398 --> 00:11:02.162]  And of course, Eisenhower didn't do it when he met with her.
[00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:04.544]  And others didn't do it.
[00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:07.187]  But see, now things have changed.
[00:11:07.227 --> 00:11:14.290]  So it was posed in our press, and in the British and Commonwealth press, people that are property of her lordship completely.
[00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:20.913]  In Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, you know, would Bush properly grovel to her?
[00:11:22.714 --> 00:11:26.515]  And he didn't do that, and so this is the headlines that we have today.
[00:11:27.015 --> 00:11:30.557]  If looks could kill, Mr. Bush, you'd be a goner.
[00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:32.678]  That's out of the Scotsman.
[00:11:34.031 --> 00:11:35.192]  Here's the UK Daily Mail.
[00:11:35.573 --> 00:11:39.156]  Blundering Bush makes another gaffe as he winks at the Queen.
[00:11:41.238 --> 00:11:50.747]  And then I read the comments by New Zealanders, by the Kiwis, by the folks in Australia, and the people in Canada, and about half of them
[00:11:52.339 --> 00:12:04.983]  Are laughing at Americans, talking about how we're scum, and then Americans counter back and say, well, we saved you in World War II, and the Canadians say, no, we fought more in World War I and World War II, we're better than you, our Queen is wonderful.
[00:12:05.543 --> 00:12:07.663]  Let's all just take a deep breath here for just a moment.
[00:12:09.844 --> 00:12:20.747]  We all properly look down on the rich kid, the trust fund kid, who never went and built anything on their own and lives in a million dollar house,
[00:12:21.739 --> 00:12:23.640]  Uh, and is involved in local charities.
[00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:26.882]  We all look down on that because that's disgusting.
[00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:30.025]  That's everything that's wrong with hereditary power.
[00:12:30.425 --> 00:12:35.628]  That's everything that's wrong with hereditary inbreeding and elites and bluebloods and the aristocracy.
[00:12:36.028 --> 00:12:44.794]  Much less the penultimate, uh, you know, the center of the scrofulous abscess, the British monarchy.
[00:12:45.655 --> 00:12:47.055]  The head of world monarchy.
[00:12:48.556 --> 00:12:50.878]  I mean, this is a disgusting joke.
[00:12:51.832 --> 00:13:00.861]  You're talking about 40 plus generations of inbreeding between William the Conqueror's
[00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:10.887]  Bloodlines, Germanic bloodlines, mixed in with Greek and a couple other bloodlines.
[00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:12.248]  They're all intermarried.
[00:13:12.448 --> 00:13:17.950]  The Dutch Queen is closely related to the Tsarists who are now extinct.
[00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.152]  We're talking first and second cousins to the British monarchy.
[00:13:22.192 --> 00:13:23.673]  It's one club of people.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:48.133]  They have been involved in so much evil and so much dehumanization, and when you go to Europe, they will, and when you go to England and you go to the Netherlands, they will shut down on a daily basis whole streets, whole rivers, whole waterways, and announce, they announce it from the buses, announce it from loudspeakers, that the Queen is not allowing traffic
[00:13:48.846 --> 00:13:50.127]  on her roads today.
[00:13:50.207 --> 00:13:52.488]  It's an exercise of power.
[00:13:52.588 --> 00:14:00.732]  You, the common peasants, can go around and spend hours getting around in huge traffic jams because she's exercising power over you.
[00:14:02.072 --> 00:14:13.398]  And she stomps around looking like an old man in drag at 81 just with her face pinched, her eyes crazed on a anal retentive power trip
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:22.632]  And our president still curtsied to a certain extent, still bowed to a certain extent, and then joked about it because he's on such an out-of-control power trip.
[00:14:23.393 --> 00:14:27.760]  And he said, oh, that's the kind of look I get, you know, that a mother would give a son.
[00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:33.163]  When he didn't properly grovel to her, she openly dissed the presidency.
[00:14:33.183 --> 00:14:39.329]  And it doesn't matter that she dissed her cousin, and that she dissed her little, you know, retarded servant.
[00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:41.310]  The point is, she was dissing us.
[00:14:41.691 --> 00:14:44.353]  Get out of my country, you scum!
[00:14:44.873 --> 00:14:49.478]  Get out of the United States, you ancestral enemy of freedom!
[00:14:49.998 --> 00:14:53.741]  George Washington and Andrew Jackson kicked your ass!
[00:14:54.882 --> 00:14:59.226]  Now get the hell out of my country, scum!
[00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:11.576]  Get out of my country, you inbred degenerate fat on the souls of the dead in Africa and worldwide that your oil companies have gone in and exterminated people.
[00:15:11.996 --> 00:15:16.060]  Get out of the United States, ancestral enemy!
[00:15:20.023 --> 00:15:21.484]  This is how far we've slipped.
[00:15:22.037 --> 00:15:32.399]  With her giving dirty looks and Bush making awkward moment jokes about the open glaring of this inbred scum!
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.380]  This inbred scum!
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:47.443]  You know, you've got Edward VIII, who was the king, just 60 years ago, having to abdicate because he was a Nazi.
[00:15:47.863 --> 00:15:49.804]  These people are trash!
[00:15:50.244 --> 00:15:51.464]  And I'm sick of them!
[00:15:52.302 --> 00:15:53.822]  Royalty is scum!
[00:15:54.123 --> 00:15:56.063]  The Japanese royalty is scum!
[00:15:56.363 --> 00:15:57.864]  The British royalty is scum!
[00:15:58.224 --> 00:15:59.724]  The Dutch royalty is scum!
[00:16:00.024 --> 00:16:01.124]  They're scum!
[00:16:02.265 --> 00:16:11.927]  And they show up in this new, modern, corrupt New World Order age, and now our leaders fall all over themselves, and are publicly humiliated by them!
[00:16:12.267 --> 00:16:14.368]  This is disgusting!
[00:16:14.688 --> 00:16:16.288]  I cannot... You know what?
[00:16:16.368 --> 00:16:21.990]  I said, years ago, that we would start seeing royalty openly in view again, and openly being worshipped.
[00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:35.120]  I mean, Prince Charles in Brasilia, their capital, has some giant gold statue where he's an angel and the world is groveling at his feet and he's basically suckling them with goodies.
[00:16:36.141 --> 00:16:40.626]  And then it's got some human population culling symbolism as well in it.
[00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:44.710]  I mean, give me a break, man!
[00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:46.612]  You look like some
[00:16:47.606 --> 00:16:55.172]  Inbred Whippet, a dog I see running around, running into itself on the hike and bike trail, to show Inbred you're completely disgusting.
[00:16:55.953 --> 00:16:58.475]  You're completely and totally disgusting.
[00:16:59.648 --> 00:17:23.087]  And we've had enough of you and your kind and all the scum and the patronage and the baronages and all the huge swarm, the huge locust swarm of sycophants and servants and curtsying, painted up women with big hats and horse races just feeding at the drop of the reflected glow of your wickedness.
[00:17:23.687 --> 00:17:34.535]  This huge, huge swarm of pilot fish that follow you around as the pieces of detritus leak from your swollen vistage of degeneracy!
[00:17:37.937 --> 00:17:39.078]  Oh my God!
[00:17:39.178 --> 00:17:42.060]  I can't, excuse me earlier, getting a little bit French on you there.
[00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:45.322]  I mean, I just, I just am letting it all hang out here.
[00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:46.203]  I cannot.
[00:17:47.143 --> 00:17:49.185]  I actually just watched the video.
[00:17:51.397 --> 00:17:52.778]  Is there no humiliation?
[00:17:52.878 --> 00:17:55.459]  Our borders are being dissolved into a North American Union.
[00:17:56.099 --> 00:18:01.301]  Spain taking over all the major roads in Texas for the King of Spain's company.
[00:18:04.082 --> 00:18:05.503]  Our nation being drug to the mud.
[00:18:05.783 --> 00:18:13.526]  This is all about dragging the presidency in our name and our sovereignty to the mud while George Bush dismantles the country and fools
[00:18:14.446 --> 00:18:25.011]  Confused Americans who are patriotic and thinking attacking some innocent country's good when that's all designed by the globalists to demonize our name worldwide and remove us as being prominent.
[00:18:26.291 --> 00:18:28.132]  They're destroying America's name.
[00:18:28.152 --> 00:18:30.313]  They're destroying the United States' goodwill.
[00:18:30.774 --> 00:18:38.697]  They're destroying our very borders and our sovereignty right now and seizing our infrastructure by buying off our elected leaders.
[00:18:41.058 --> 00:18:42.559]  And as if that isn't enough,
[00:18:43.323 --> 00:18:50.688]  And the big radio stations and TV stations are all announcing that this is Mexico and it's all a big globalist finance joke.
[00:18:51.569 --> 00:19:03.196]  And they've got hordes of third worlders who don't know any better running around with glee crazed in the streets as the elite uses the underclass to destroy the middle class as they've always done in classical class warfare directed from the top.
[00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:05.538]  And I have to watch.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.982]  Just the ultimate expression of evil.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:22.446]  Dressed up in that monkey suit, sitting up there, dishing our president in front of the entire world.
[00:19:22.906 --> 00:19:24.387]  And again, it isn't George Bush.
[00:19:24.427 --> 00:19:26.568]  I could care less about George Bush.
[00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:36.395]  The point is that he is the symbol of this country, and he has been designed to drag us through the mud, and now this is just... It's only going to get worse.
[00:19:36.435 --> 00:19:41.318]  Our humiliation is only going to get worse at the hands of these scoundrels.
[00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:45.435]  We'll talk more about it when we get back.
[00:19:45.455 --> 00:19:50.101]  Then we'll get into all the important news and the dollar, what's happening with the dollar.
[00:19:50.942 --> 00:19:51.743]  And a lot more.
[00:19:51.823 --> 00:19:55.247]  It's just... This is just off the charts.
[00:19:55.587 --> 00:19:57.510]  And the way the foreigners are getting off on it.
[00:20:02.466 --> 00:20:04.528]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.148 --> 00:20:14.076]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.517 --> 00:20:21.723]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.435 --> 00:20:27.938]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.419 --> 00:20:39.265]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.006 --> 00:20:42.067]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.567 --> 00:20:43.988]  For more information, call 702-953-0111.
[00:20:49.123 --> 00:21:07.287]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:08.407 --> 00:21:13.208]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:13.428 --> 00:21:16.169]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:16.209 --> 00:21:17.289]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:18.661 --> 00:21:23.264]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:24.184 --> 00:21:31.448]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:32.449 --> 00:21:35.511]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:35.751 --> 00:21:41.134]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:21:42.115 --> 00:21:43.375]  Call for your copy today.
[00:21:43.395 --> 00:21:43.595]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.878 --> 00:21:52.704]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:21:53.344 --> 00:21:53.485]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.505 --> 00:21:53.805]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.388 --> 00:22:02.149]  Terrorism!
[00:22:02.309 --> 00:22:03.049]  Terrorism!
[00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:09.234]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:22:09.474 --> 00:22:11.075]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:22:11.315 --> 00:22:13.797]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:22:14.177 --> 00:22:28.767]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:22:28.787 --> 00:22:29.108]  government.
[00:22:29.288 --> 00:22:31.089]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:22:31.449 --> 00:22:37.370]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:41.991]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:22:47.873 --> 00:22:49.673]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:22:49.693 --> 00:22:49.873]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:49.893 --> 00:22:51.673]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:23:00.954 --> 00:23:01.794]  Attention gardeners!
[00:23:01.855 --> 00:23:04.216]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:23:04.456 --> 00:23:08.798]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[00:23:08.998 --> 00:23:16.862]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:23:17.182 --> 00:23:20.004]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:23:20.304 --> 00:23:27.849]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:23:27.929 --> 00:23:33.533]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:23:33.753 --> 00:23:39.316]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:23:39.597 --> 00:23:42.919]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:23:43.159 --> 00:23:46.481]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:23:46.721 --> 00:23:51.769]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dervsheep Superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:23:51.809 --> 00:23:54.674]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:23:54.694 --> 00:23:54.894]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:24:08.565 --> 00:24:15.668]  Every move you make, you inbred piece of trash with millions of dead under your belt and your, your brethren's belt.
[00:24:16.248 --> 00:24:27.613]  Every criminal act you commit, every fake environmental operation you launch to bring us back into feudalism, we'll be there watching you and exposing you and calling you out, you murderous whore.
[00:24:35.894 --> 00:24:37.615]  And every arrogant thing you say.
[00:24:37.635 --> 00:24:55.360]  You're noticing that I'm deliberately... I never call people whores.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.641]  I rarely call even very evil women.
[00:24:58.681 --> 00:25:01.842]  I've never really called Janet Reno names like that.
[00:25:01.902 --> 00:25:03.082]  She's a pathetic demon.
[00:25:04.335 --> 00:25:05.736]  Ran the mass murder at Wake Up.
[00:25:05.816 --> 00:25:06.876]  I don't call her a whore.
[00:25:07.476 --> 00:25:09.017]  They need to be called whores.
[00:25:09.217 --> 00:25:11.778]  Because she is all about everyone must respect her.
[00:25:11.838 --> 00:25:13.659]  Everyone must grovel to her.
[00:25:13.779 --> 00:25:15.700]  Everyone must kneel to her.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.200]  Everyone must treat her.
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:21.742]  There's a certain etiquette when you come into contact with her.
[00:25:23.823 --> 00:25:28.505]  Everyone must present themselves like trained monkeys or trained dogs to her.
[00:25:28.765 --> 00:25:29.466]  Who are you?
[00:25:29.506 --> 00:25:30.426]  You're nobody!
[00:25:31.767 --> 00:25:34.248]  You own over half the land in the United Kingdom.
[00:25:34.628 --> 00:25:39.849]  You own the natural resources of Canada and, what, over 15 other Commonwealth nations.
[00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:46.431]  Your forces have been involved in mass murder worldwide, but your propaganda corps is so good it's kept quiet.
[00:25:48.012 --> 00:25:53.334]  You've been involved, and the people you represent have been involved in so many crimes, it's unspeakable.
[00:25:54.314 --> 00:26:00.576]  The MI6 that you command, and that swears fealty to you, carried out the attacks of 7-7.
[00:26:02.088 --> 00:26:04.689]  You clearly were involved coordinating the 9-11 attacks.
[00:26:04.709 --> 00:26:06.309]  That is, the people that work for you were.
[00:26:06.329 --> 00:26:10.130]  And I'm not going to put up with it anymore.
[00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.151]  I'm not going to go along with it anymore.
[00:26:14.771 --> 00:26:21.933]  And you come over here, and President Bush does his customary bumbling, and you freak out and bug your eyes out.
[00:26:23.999 --> 00:26:38.628]  Now, it could be that Bush is so arrogant and so into exercising power himself that he was dissing her, saying, I remember when you came here in 1776, he meant for the celebration of another event, and then she got really upset.
[00:26:38.888 --> 00:26:42.770]  But she was already upset when he was winking at her, bulging her eyes out.
[00:26:43.691 --> 00:26:44.211]  Listen to this.
[00:26:44.571 --> 00:26:46.933]  If looks could kill, Mr. Bush, you'd be a goner.
[00:26:47.506 --> 00:26:51.492]  A cloudless blue sky, a military marching band, an immaculate red carpet.
[00:26:51.792 --> 00:26:57.079]  The White House managed to put everything in order yesterday for the Queen's first visit to the United States in 16 years.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.602]  Oh, we managed for you!
[00:26:59.622 --> 00:27:02.106]  We managed to just, you know...
[00:27:02.746 --> 00:27:23.280]  We managed to do it right for your hereditary ruler who closes the roads and tax you and feeds on you and has a big degenerate family of scum that flounces around and has big monuments put up for them and are involved in land grabbing worldwide and are involved in eugenics programs and are involved in pushing sterilization programs.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:28.703]  Oh, we managed to grovel properly to our ancestral enemies who in 1812
[00:27:31.005 --> 00:27:37.974]  Brought in their battleships and destroyed the White House and burned it to the ground and shelled New York and Virginia.
[00:27:38.935 --> 00:27:40.116]  It was real funny.
[00:27:40.917 --> 00:27:41.838]  It was real funny.
[00:27:47.565 --> 00:27:50.449]  It was real funny when you attacked the White House and blew it up.
[00:27:52.944 --> 00:27:59.548]  I mean, the point is, they came in with the Royal Institute of International Affairs and set up the CFR in 1921.
[00:27:59.809 --> 00:28:08.414]  The CFR brags about this, to hire the best and brightest in government and out of government to take over the government and merge us back in with the British Empire.
[00:28:08.614 --> 00:28:10.756]  That's the new world order, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:15.532]  And for any arrogant British listening who think you're part of it, you're nothing!
[00:28:15.772 --> 00:28:18.493]  You've been sucked dry to fund the whole thing, you fool!
[00:28:18.734 --> 00:28:25.277]  And your country's been overrun with foreigners, and you've been taught to sit down and shut up and take it, while they bring you down as well!
[00:28:28.478 --> 00:28:30.299]  Because they are usurpers.
[00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:32.300]  They're not even English.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.101]  They're not even from your country.
[00:28:38.483 --> 00:28:39.664]  It's a ruling family.
[00:28:40.467 --> 00:28:44.529]  They're Italian, they're French, they're German, they're Greek, they're Russian.
[00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.470]  They're all intermarried.
[00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.531]  It's one breed of scum.
[00:28:50.812 --> 00:28:55.294]  They all look alike, they all talk the same, and they all have no compulsion.
[00:28:55.414 --> 00:28:59.196]  It is bred into them to be cold-blooded killers.
[00:29:01.704 --> 00:29:10.486]  On a cloudless blue sky, a military marching band, an immaculate red carpet, the White House managed to put everything in order yesterday for the Queen's first visit to the United States in 16 years.
[00:29:10.606 --> 00:29:12.747]  Everything, that is, except for George Bush.
[00:29:14.327 --> 00:29:21.029]  In his opening remarks, the President managed to undo weeks of preparation in a single phrase at the welcoming ceremony in Washington, D.C.
[00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:29.911]  Mr. Bush had been talking about one of the Queen's previous visits in 1976, which coincided with the 200th anniversary of the American independence.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.181]  Now, she was coming back over here to brag and say, we're in control.
[00:29:33.801 --> 00:29:37.482]  In front of more than 7,000 politicians, diplomats, and White House staff and their families.
[00:29:37.983 --> 00:29:41.384]  We'll tell you what Mr. Bush said when we get back, then get into all the other news.
[00:29:42.104 --> 00:29:44.265]  Get out of the United States, enemy!
[00:29:44.585 --> 00:29:45.465]  You're an enemy!
[00:29:45.785 --> 00:29:47.666]  Get out of here, you scum!
[00:29:51.528 --> 00:29:52.508]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.908 --> 00:29:54.549]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.569 --> 00:29:58.110]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:06.012]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[00:30:06.273 --> 00:30:10.135]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[00:30:10.495 --> 00:30:15.518]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[00:30:15.798 --> 00:30:26.985]  Electrolyzed plus water will alkalize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.

[00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:24.332]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:57.710]  Box 8 Bethlehem, MD 21609.
[00:33:09.253 --> 00:33:14.496]  You got a woman never worked a day in her life, but the propaganda always phrases it.
[00:33:14.516 --> 00:33:20.359]  At 81, she still has time for her duties and works hard, visiting with her subjects.
[00:33:21.459 --> 00:33:25.021]  The Queen then dropped by a charity event for African children.
[00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:30.824]  The Queen then went and visited a new destroyer being launched, named after her mother.
[00:33:31.265 --> 00:33:32.565]  The Queen did this.
[00:33:32.585 --> 00:33:35.047]  The Queen, oh, what would we do without her?
[00:33:35.587 --> 00:33:37.388]  Oh, she's so wonderful.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:48.344]  And then one of her twit sons owns the big company that controls most of the footage of the Royals that they then dole and shell to the world's media.
[00:33:48.364 --> 00:33:49.885]  You know they profit from all that junk?
[00:33:50.285 --> 00:33:59.249]  And it's always about how they don't have money, and they don't have power, and they're just a remnant, and they don't... See, that's what real power does, it tells you it doesn't have power.
[00:33:59.947 --> 00:34:02.009]  She owns a controlling interest in British Petroleum.
[00:34:02.049 --> 00:34:03.310]  She owns diamond mines.
[00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:06.933]  That woman owns most of the infrastructure of Canada.
[00:34:07.253 --> 00:34:08.654]  Her likeness is on the money!
[00:34:09.875 --> 00:34:11.957]  These people's wealth is uncalculable!
[00:34:12.497 --> 00:34:20.604]  Her cousin, the next richest royalty, the Dutch, House of Orange, which again is from the same Germanic bloodline, didn't take over until the 1840s.
[00:34:20.844 --> 00:34:23.786]  They just came in, took over, and said, Queen of the Netherlands!
[00:34:23.866 --> 00:34:24.467]  Oh, okay!
[00:34:24.847 --> 00:34:25.628]  King of the Netherlands!
[00:34:28.789 --> 00:34:41.079]  I have no doubt if the Bushes continue to get their grandkids and the rest of it will be, you know, King George the Ninth, Galactic Ruler, and his cousin, Duke Edward of Mars, and everyone will have to kneel to our great leaders.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.822]  And Viscount Rockefeller dropped by.
[00:34:44.842 --> 00:34:49.385]  I mean, this is what we're going back to, and I don't like it.
[00:34:51.447 --> 00:34:52.988]  Let me put it in another perspective here.
[00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:56.191]  Why are they like rock stars?
[00:34:57.856 --> 00:35:08.438]  I mean, just a few decades ago they were detested and hated, but the media used the spectacle of Diana and Prince Charles' wedding, I guess, like a soap opera, to get all the mindless women out there swooning.
[00:35:08.458 --> 00:35:22.240]  Oh my gosh, to be around royalty, oh it's so... I mean, I guess for those that sup and totally get off on being around, quote, power, that it's an aphrodisiac.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.861]  I mean, let me just tell you, I was giddy this morning.
[00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:26.681]  Let me tell you what I'm into.
[00:35:30.479 --> 00:35:56.456]  I mentioned a few weeks ago that I bought a little meteorite at a store, and then I kind of got excited about it and bought a couple off eBay, and to hold something from deep space, something that's so ancient and out of this world, or this morning the chihuahua was barking in the backyard, and we run out of it, and it was harassing a little box turtle, a juvenile box turtle, it was probably only about
[00:35:57.293 --> 00:36:14.970]  You know, three inches around, and it was too young to even be afraid like a normal box turtle, so it was out, and its little orange eyes, beautiful orange eyes, beautiful orange markings on its lower jaw, lower beak, and little orange spots on the fronts of his arms, his little green tail.
[00:36:15.731 --> 00:36:22.317]  And I literally barely made it to work because the children got back from a music lesson,
[00:36:24.156 --> 00:36:30.441]  And it was like 10 in the morning, and I was supposed to have been getting ready for the show, but I heard the dog barking, so I went back in the back and found the turtle.
[00:36:30.481 --> 00:36:34.344]  It itself was raiding strawberries in the garden.
[00:36:34.844 --> 00:36:36.985]  My dad had said, look, a turtle's eating those.
[00:36:37.005 --> 00:36:43.170]  He was over a few weeks ago, and I said, no, dad, that's bugs, because there were some doodle bugs eating ones that were on the ground.
[00:36:44.804 --> 00:36:46.125]  He said, no, that's a turtle.
[00:36:46.565 --> 00:36:48.685]  Um, yeah, yeah, sure, it's a turtle, Dad.
[00:36:48.725 --> 00:36:50.706]  You know, because I haven't really seen a lot of box turtles.
[00:36:51.106 --> 00:36:53.287]  Saw a lot in northeast Texas where I grew up.
[00:36:53.667 --> 00:36:56.028]  See a lot of them in east Texas where we got some family property.
[00:36:56.048 --> 00:36:59.569]  Uh, that we got from the king of Spain.
[00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:03.191]  Again, one that we bought for a few cents an acre from his royalness.
[00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:05.752]  Oh, oh, give him the royalness.
[00:37:05.792 --> 00:37:06.792]  It's all around us.
[00:37:07.192 --> 00:37:07.692]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:08.373 --> 00:37:08.813]  And, um,
[00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:14.573]  Because his scum forces couldn't hold it from the Native Americans.
[00:37:14.593 --> 00:37:18.617]  That's the only reason the Tennesseans were brought in to secure the property.
[00:37:18.657 --> 00:37:24.802]  And then the little frothing Nerdy Wells, Santa Ana, tried to come up here and take it back and got his behind kicked.
[00:37:25.062 --> 00:37:25.563]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:25.843 --> 00:37:28.365]  See, those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:28.966 --> 00:37:32.249]  You have to take what you want from these scum or you'll be a slave.
[00:37:34.491 --> 00:37:35.972]  But getting back to what I was saying,
[00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:51.939]  This little turtle, so I literally until like 15 minutes till was out there with the turtle and then we let it go and it went back under the fence and into the sliver of green belt that's left of the sports super center behind our house to worship Lance Armstrong.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.341]  It's a literal cathedral to him.
[00:37:56.121 --> 00:37:59.563]  Again, all part of the worshiping the personality like a bunch of monkeys.
[00:38:02.565 --> 00:38:05.907]  But I mean just to look at that little turtle, just to see God's handiwork,
[00:38:06.717 --> 00:38:12.986]  It was a thing that had more value to me than a jewel.
[00:38:13.466 --> 00:38:14.287]  It was a jewel.
[00:38:14.708 --> 00:38:15.769]  Biomechanics.
[00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:21.657]  I was driving to work thinking about just a grasshopper or a spider.
[00:38:24.295 --> 00:38:34.578]  Of course, the globalists know we love all of that and see the beauty in it, so they misappropriate it under themselves and make themselves the guardians of it, and it will just make them feudal lords.
[00:38:35.038 --> 00:38:39.679]  They will protect it, and they will take care of it for us.
[00:38:39.739 --> 00:38:46.721]  Now, the truth is, they're the ones destroying it and killing it, and using our energies towards protecting the Earth for a fake world tax that has nothing to do with it.
[00:38:47.901 --> 00:38:51.242]  So my only point is, the night sky, the trees,
[00:38:53.223 --> 00:39:11.441]  A thunderstorm when it's pouring down and just the sound and the smell of the ozone and the trees waving in the wind and nightfall or to see a couple of rabbits' hairs out in the field or at the edge of your campsite.
[00:39:12.573 --> 00:39:14.994]  To see a badger walking around in the mist.
[00:39:15.054 --> 00:39:16.814]  I mean, all of this is what life's really about.
[00:39:17.174 --> 00:39:23.575]  That's what we should be in love with, and in love with our families, and friends with our neighbors, and fellowship with the common people.
[00:39:24.295 --> 00:39:26.436]  Not, oh, the Queen!
[00:39:26.456 --> 00:39:28.776]  The Queen!
[00:39:28.796 --> 00:39:29.856]  Oh, it's the Queen!
[00:39:29.916 --> 00:39:30.377]  The Queen!
[00:39:30.697 --> 00:39:31.317]  It's the Queen!
[00:39:31.357 --> 00:39:31.797]  Look at her!
[00:39:32.257 --> 00:39:33.497]  Oh, she's so incredible!
[00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:34.097]  And what is she?
[00:39:34.817 --> 00:39:37.758]  A hard-eyed, predatory lizard.
[00:39:39.059 --> 00:39:41.962]  And I use that figuratively, not literally, but you can see where people get that idea.
[00:39:41.982 --> 00:39:49.849]  Just predatorially stomping around, obsessed with her breeding and a narcissistic love theft with herself.
[00:39:50.692 --> 00:39:56.155]  In a narcissistic love fest with her twit-like family with their beaks.
[00:39:56.756 --> 00:39:59.637]  You know, just like a brood of carrion roosters.
[00:39:59.657 --> 00:40:02.079]  I mean, you make me sick.
[00:40:02.619 --> 00:40:04.440]  You literally are the antithesis.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.042]  You are the polar opposite of what I love, of what I admire.
[00:40:08.382 --> 00:40:19.689]  And to watch people thronging and stumbling over themselves, rushing to the fore to get a glimpse of you makes my soul cry out!
[00:40:23.141 --> 00:40:30.607]  You and your kind are going to be brought to justice, and the New World Order is going to be defeated, but it is so humiliating.
[00:40:30.627 --> 00:40:32.288]  I'm going to finish up with this and then get to the news.
[00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:51.802]  In front of more than 7,000 politicians, diplomats, and White House staff and their families, all out to see the arch-criminal, I would add, Mr. Bush told the Queen, you helped our nation to celebrate its bicentennial in 17, before hastily
[00:40:52.606 --> 00:40:54.028]  Correcting himself by saying 1976.
[00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:58.515]  Now anybody can make that.
[00:40:58.836 --> 00:41:01.500]  But she just glared and looked at him with total hatred.
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:05.025]  The crowd laughed and the President paused, turned to the Queen and winked.
[00:41:05.777 --> 00:41:07.598]  He turned, I think he did it on purpose, folks.
[00:41:07.618 --> 00:41:14.123]  I think there's some soul, some really evil ones who look good, can talk good, can take action, can put the evil out.
[00:41:14.424 --> 00:41:16.565]  I think Bush is very evil and very bestial.
[00:41:16.865 --> 00:41:20.848]  I think there's some, like Darth Vader, some good left there.
[00:41:21.469 --> 00:41:23.711]  And I think that's why he does stuff like that.
[00:41:24.411 --> 00:41:25.672]  I've seen the video now.
[00:41:25.692 --> 00:41:27.774]  It was definitely, she did not like it.
[00:41:27.814 --> 00:41:28.674]  He was dissing her.
[00:41:28.995 --> 00:41:29.915]  So in a way, I guess...
[00:41:32.998 --> 00:41:41.404]  I don't like to like it, but it says he turned back to the lectern and quipped, She gave me a look that only a mother could give a child.
[00:41:41.684 --> 00:41:45.306]  But then there's kind of that sick acquiescence that she's the boss, see?
[00:41:45.787 --> 00:41:47.348]  The Queen laughed in response.
[00:41:48.749 --> 00:42:00.802]  Yesterday was always going to be a struggle for the President, who against his natural inclinations has organized a day of high pomp and pageantry over the White House lawn, familiar with Mr. Bush's famed informality the U.S.
[00:42:00.842 --> 00:42:04.586]  press had, in a run-up to the Queen's visit, predicted disaster.
[00:42:04.606 --> 00:42:09.251]  Now I guess Bush has adopted some Texian ways.
[00:42:10.246 --> 00:42:13.749]  And we're very polite and nice in Texas, folks.
[00:42:14.169 --> 00:42:20.815]  We're friendly people, give me the shirt off our back, but I gotta tell you, real Texans, most people are foreigners here, aren't from the state now, and it's okay.
[00:42:21.075 --> 00:42:21.916]  Everything has to die.
[00:42:21.936 --> 00:42:22.757]  The state has to die.
[00:42:22.777 --> 00:42:23.877]  It has to end.
[00:42:24.418 --> 00:42:25.459]  Everything ends, I guess.
[00:42:25.539 --> 00:42:27.020]  Even the stars die, as they say.
[00:42:28.001 --> 00:42:34.166]  But it is not the Texas way to put on a bunch of pretenses, I will.
[00:42:34.486 --> 00:42:34.987]  Because, again,
[00:42:36.107 --> 00:42:45.200]  Texas is made up of Alabamans and Texans and Georgians and South Carolinians of the fighters, folks, and that's why
[00:42:46.665 --> 00:42:51.649]  And, uh, we didn't like the Royals very much, and so it is distinctly disgusting.
[00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:56.413]  That was the whole reason for throwing it off, as Alexander de Tocqueville wrote about.
[00:42:56.713 --> 00:42:59.896]  It was a culture born out of getting past class controls.
[00:43:00.216 --> 00:43:06.221]  It was a culture born where the mayor showed up and he curtsied to the men sitting in the bar.
[00:43:06.701 --> 00:43:11.525]  It was a culture born of where you didn't show respect to the commoners, you got run out of town on a rail.
[00:43:11.825 --> 00:43:14.968]  You see, it's the complete opposite, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:16.335 --> 00:43:27.007]  It was English gentlemen who decided to throw off all of the controls and to consciously go against it.
[00:43:27.648 --> 00:43:29.129]  And that's exactly what happened.
[00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:33.534]  And to see it turned on its head makes me want to THROW UP!
[00:43:37.276 --> 00:43:43.302]  The New York Times pondered how the Tao Snappin Texan, he's from Kennebunkport, Maine, he's a cousin of the Queen.
[00:43:43.762 --> 00:43:53.131]  The Tao Snappin Texan, who puts his feet on the coffee table, drinks water straight from the bottle, and was once caught on tape talking with food in his mouth, will cope.
[00:43:54.230 --> 00:44:11.223]  USA Today warned how Mr. Bush would go over with British royalty, the true sultans of ceremony, adding Bush is famous for his opposition to formality and staying up late, but he is nevertheless going all out for the Queen.
[00:44:11.623 --> 00:44:19.009]  The President may have staged the first white tie state banquet of his administration last night, but it was his gaffe that stole the show.
[00:44:20.154 --> 00:44:27.439]  Unruffled, the Queen took the podium and quickly swung into her prepared speech, hailing the closeness of the U.S.-British relations.
[00:44:27.479 --> 00:44:28.940]  You mean your takeover of the U.S.
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.142]  through the CFR, you piece of trash?
[00:44:32.462 --> 00:44:34.184]  This is the person that's getting rid of our borders.
[00:44:35.064 --> 00:44:36.565]  There's a titular head to all this.
[00:44:36.645 --> 00:44:36.945]  It's her.
[00:44:37.246 --> 00:44:38.647]  She's the one killing my country.
[00:44:38.907 --> 00:44:39.727]  Killing your country!
[00:44:39.847 --> 00:44:40.428]  I hate her!
[00:44:43.061 --> 00:44:44.822]  She's the one destroying Britain right now.
[00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:46.602]  She's got thought police out everywhere.
[00:44:46.642 --> 00:44:53.605]  She's breaking down the borders as fast as she can and trying to install social services mechanisms to stop Britoners from breathing.
[00:44:54.686 --> 00:44:55.806]  That was in the news yesterday.
[00:44:56.106 --> 00:44:58.407]  She wants the death of your great culture.
[00:44:58.847 --> 00:45:02.469]  She is a absolute piece of trash!
[00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:07.331]  Oh, it makes me sick!
[00:45:07.992 --> 00:45:10.373]  Because they destroy anything that's strong, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:10.393 --> 00:45:11.513]  That's their instinct.
[00:45:11.813 --> 00:45:13.073]  They go right into rivals.
[00:45:13.113 --> 00:45:17.154]  They killed off their cousins, the Czars, who were identical to King Edward.
[00:45:17.174 --> 00:45:18.415]  You couldn't even tell the difference.
[00:45:19.055 --> 00:45:20.195]  Edward VII.
[00:45:20.935 --> 00:45:26.036]  You couldn't, uh, Edward VIII's, uh... Not Edward VIII.
[00:45:26.437 --> 00:45:27.557]  Oh, man, my mind.
[00:45:29.317 --> 00:45:30.277]  Edward VIII was back in the 1500s.
[00:45:30.358 --> 00:45:34.138]  It was, uh... Drives me crazy.
[00:45:34.479 --> 00:45:36.239]  I can remember all this stuff when I'm not on air.
[00:45:37.546 --> 00:45:41.208]  And then, uh, Hey Rob, I know you're out there.
[00:45:41.228 --> 00:45:43.670]  We just spent weeks editing video of that turkey.
[00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:49.573]  Ah, what is the name of the guy that had to advocate in, uh, in 39?
[00:45:51.154 --> 00:45:53.015]  And he married, uh, the American.
[00:45:53.215 --> 00:45:54.456]  Oh man, it right up against the wall.
[00:45:54.516 --> 00:45:55.336]  I'll dig it out in a minute.
[00:45:57.718 --> 00:46:01.200]  As soon as I, as soon as I got a break and, and, and I'm not on the spot, I'll remember his name.
[00:46:02.409 --> 00:46:10.972]  Keeping track of this trash, you know, one breed, you know, one line of the breeders from the next is just, it's hard to do.
[00:46:10.992 --> 00:46:15.574]  It doesn't matter, the British people don't even know these people's real names.
[00:46:15.614 --> 00:46:21.216]  At least I know their name is four to five first names and then Saxe-Kuberg-Gutha.
[00:46:24.337 --> 00:46:25.698]  Edward VIII, what am I thinking?
[00:46:25.838 --> 00:46:25.958]  It's...
[00:46:31.348 --> 00:46:32.428]  I guess Rob's not out there.
[00:46:32.448 --> 00:46:34.009]  He must have his headset on out there editing.
[00:46:34.569 --> 00:46:35.349]  Right through the door.
[00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:43.632]  Unruffled, the Queen took the podium and quickly swung into her prepared speech, hailing the closeness of the U.S.-British relations.
[00:46:45.493 --> 00:46:56.617]  It is the moment to take stock of our present friendship, rightly taking pleasure from its shrinks while never taking these for granted, she said.
[00:46:57.398 --> 00:47:03.042]  And it is the time to look forward, jointly renewing our commitment to a more prosperous, safer, and freer world.
[00:47:03.082 --> 00:47:04.083]  That's the complete opposite.
[00:47:04.303 --> 00:47:05.964]  You are nothing but darkness and enslavement.
[00:47:09.597 --> 00:47:24.744]  Penny Gerr, whose book, The Firm Documents, The Inner Workings of the Royal Family, said, I would have thought that this would have received, without a great deal of humor, the Royal Family taking the whole business of respecting the office, if not the person, very seriously.
[00:47:24.784 --> 00:47:29.266]  So Bush's second comment was over-familiar.
[00:47:29.667 --> 00:47:30.967]  The Queen is human, of course.
[00:47:31.427 --> 00:47:31.547]  Oh!
[00:47:31.988 --> 00:47:33.608]  Oh, the President was over-familiar.
[00:47:33.869 --> 00:47:34.989]  She's human, of course.
[00:47:35.209 --> 00:47:37.230]  That's a way of saying she's not human.
[00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:38.691]  She's human, of course.
[00:47:39.745 --> 00:47:42.607]  Oh, we have to say she's human, because she's so god-like.
[00:47:42.707 --> 00:47:44.527]  A literal bucket of evil.
[00:47:46.568 --> 00:47:49.430]  So, Bush's second comment was over-familiar.
[00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:51.111]  Well, then don't come to the White House!
[00:47:51.151 --> 00:47:54.152]  Don't ask to come for a state visit, you piece of trash!
[00:47:54.532 --> 00:47:56.273]  But again, who's even sicker than the Queen?
[00:47:56.533 --> 00:47:58.014]  It's people like Penny Juror.
[00:47:58.254 --> 00:47:59.275]  I want to get her on!
[00:47:59.315 --> 00:48:01.936]  I want to get Penny Juror on this show!
[00:48:04.108 --> 00:48:04.949]  Oh my God.
[00:48:05.049 --> 00:48:06.970]  The Queen is human.
[00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.092]  All these manners is about slave training.
[00:48:09.112 --> 00:48:10.553]  The Japanese have it, the British have it.
[00:48:10.713 --> 00:48:14.616]  About being quiet, not standing up, not being uppity, not speaking.
[00:48:14.636 --> 00:48:26.784]  Because you had a bunch of wild Britons, Britties as the tribe was called, and a bunch of wild Scotties running around, and Welsh running around.
[00:48:29.368 --> 00:48:31.949]  And of course, you know, they get conquered by William the Conqueror.
[00:48:31.969 --> 00:48:35.491]  You've got to domesticate them and give them imperial dog training.
[00:48:35.991 --> 00:48:38.592]  I break your imperial conditioning, scum!
[00:48:40.133 --> 00:48:41.614]  Everyone, break your conditioning to them!
[00:48:41.674 --> 00:48:42.194]  Hate them!
[00:48:42.935 --> 00:48:43.415]  Hate them!
[00:48:43.455 --> 00:48:45.076]  They're enemies of you and your family.
[00:48:45.976 --> 00:48:54.721]  Don't listen to these twits and these people all over these TV programs that the royals finance and produce many of them, up there about how to be good little twits and how to serve them.
[00:48:54.921 --> 00:48:57.983]  Don't be inducted into bondage against your hereditary enemies.
[00:48:59.663 --> 00:49:00.624]  Oh my gosh.
[00:49:02.125 --> 00:49:04.947]  So Bush's second comment was over-familiar.
[00:49:05.007 --> 00:49:10.991]  The Queen is human, of course, and would have seen that he was trying to get himself out of an awkward situation.
[00:49:11.251 --> 00:49:16.235]  But I don't think it would have been taken as particularly funny by Her Highness.
[00:49:16.615 --> 00:49:18.416]  Her Highness!
[00:49:18.437 --> 00:49:18.477]  Oh!
[00:49:19.417 --> 00:49:20.238]  Her Highness!
[00:49:22.685 --> 00:49:26.528]  The latest incident will do little to endear the President to the Queen.
[00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:33.173]  Oh, he won't be endeared to the richest person on Earth, who has had a close relationship with other U.S.
[00:49:33.213 --> 00:49:35.335]  leaders, particularly Ronald Reagan.
[00:49:35.795 --> 00:49:38.057]  The former film star loved formality.
[00:49:38.398 --> 00:49:42.761]  He wore morning dresses at his 81 inauguration.
[00:49:44.122 --> 00:49:44.883]  Whatever that means.
[00:49:45.203 --> 00:49:46.104]  When he visited the U.K.
[00:49:46.164 --> 00:49:50.187]  in the 80s, he and the Queen rode horses together in Windsor's Great Park.
[00:49:51.824 --> 00:49:53.967]  Talent for gaffes runs in the family.
[00:49:54.328 --> 00:50:01.859]  The gaffe-prone President Bush once admitted to the Queen he was the black sheep of his family and then turned to her and asked, who's yours?
[00:50:02.529 --> 00:50:07.132]  The encounter came at the White House in 1991 when his father, George Bush Sr., was in power.
[00:50:07.493 --> 00:50:10.795]  Barbara Bush stepped in and warned the monarch, don't answer that.
[00:50:10.855 --> 00:50:12.897]  The Queen wisely did not reply.
[00:50:13.397 --> 00:50:17.140]  The current president is well known for awkward encounters with heads of state.
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:24.846]  He once shocked Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, when he tried to give her a back rub at a G8 conference.
[00:50:26.166 --> 00:50:30.790]  The incident was caught on video and became an instant hit on the internet YouTube site.
[00:50:31.946 --> 00:50:38.949]  Another high-powered meeting, Mr. Bush famously paused while chewing his lunch to shout, Yo Blair!
[00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:40.550]  at the Prime Minister.
[00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:49.975]  And then everyone goes and comments in the comment section, Oh, it's so horrible he didn't treat her with proper respect.
[00:50:50.015 --> 00:50:56.158]  He didn't treat our owner, our slave master, the one ruling us and destroying us properly.
[00:50:56.178 --> 00:50:58.599]  Oh, you didn't know what's wrong with you.
[00:51:04.608 --> 00:51:10.037]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.417 --> 00:51:18.009]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.757 --> 00:51:25.821]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.201 --> 00:51:37.627]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.947 --> 00:51:41.409]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:43.851]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.171 --> 00:51:48.013]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.514 --> 00:52:04.697]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:04.717 --> 00:52:08.760]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:11.462]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:11.522 --> 00:52:13.844]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:14.044 --> 00:52:22.471]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:22.551 --> 00:52:23.872]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:52:23.992 --> 00:52:27.995]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:27.995 --> 00:52:28.495]  We're good to go!
[00:52:48.422 --> 00:52:51.465]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.
[00:52:51.485 --> 00:52:53.106]  888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:53.126 --> 00:52:54.067]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:01.235 --> 00:53:02.956]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.176 --> 00:53:06.877]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:07.197 --> 00:53:09.418]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[00:53:16.281 --> 00:53:21.163]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.383 --> 00:53:30.411]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:54:14.707 --> 00:54:19.370]  We got Jim Tucker coming up.
[00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:29.456]  Well, I've opened phones with him on air with us, on Vildenberg Group, on the Global Elite, the parasites that rule over us.
[00:54:29.476 --> 00:54:39.522]  You know, my point about the turtle and asteroids and meteorites, things like that, was I was reading this story here on a science and technology page of CNN.
[00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:43.605]  A giant exploding star outshines previous supernovas.
[00:54:45.493 --> 00:54:54.255]  Scientists have just released images of the brightest stellar explosion recorded, the supernova known as SN 2006 GY.
[00:54:54.495 --> 00:54:56.135]  Notice they just released it, they hoard it.
[00:54:56.155 --> 00:54:58.636]  It's been out for a year, they've had it.
[00:54:58.656 --> 00:55:02.756]  It was believed to be about 150 times as massive as the Sun.
[00:55:02.776 --> 00:55:09.078]  The explosion could help astronomers better understand how the first generation of stars in the universe died.
[00:55:09.098 --> 00:55:15.099]  This supernova stands out as the brightest supernova that's ever been observed, said Nathan Smith,
[00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:30.497]  Astrophysicist at the University of California at Berkeley, and it goes on to say that it is 238 million light years away from Earth.
[00:55:32.397 --> 00:55:41.381]  That gives you an idea of how transient and blink of the eye your life is, or all of human history on this planet, and how little we are.
[00:55:41.822 --> 00:55:42.462]  See, I'm humble.
[00:55:43.050 --> 00:56:12.527]  I realize I'm this tiny little creature that's living one time and loving one time and having a family one time and I sit here on this planet and I look at inbred scum in fancy outfits on red carpets getting off on other monkey people literally like monkeys will run up or apes will run up and worship you know the head ape I'm watching all this simian behavior instead of us going on to the next level of looking at the universe around us and having higher ideals
[00:56:14.449 --> 00:56:16.009]  Instead, we're going in reverse.
[00:56:16.029 --> 00:56:20.270]  We worship American Idol and some inbred piece of filth known as Queen Elizabeth.
[00:56:21.431 --> 00:56:28.652]  And there's all this incredible mystery and majesty and beauty and intricate detail.
[00:56:31.753 --> 00:56:36.934]  And again, we're reduced to worshipping some inbred, never worked a day in her life, criminal.
[00:56:37.655 --> 00:56:39.515]  Clearly involved in killing Princess Diana.
[00:56:42.091 --> 00:56:50.254]  With her degenerate son, who goes around talking about exterminating the population all day, with her degenerate husband, Prince Philip, who walks behind her.
[00:56:51.774 --> 00:56:53.615]  See, it's all about walking behind her.
[00:56:53.635 --> 00:56:55.655]  It's not about, oh, you're the power.
[00:56:56.316 --> 00:56:59.777]  It's all about... I mean, here's an audio clip of Bush's gaffe.
[00:57:01.477 --> 00:57:05.038]  The American people are proud to welcome your majesty back to the United States.
[00:57:06.139 --> 00:57:07.739]  A nation you've come to know very well.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.380]  After all, you've dined
[00:57:11.331 --> 00:57:12.252]  With ten U.S.
[00:57:12.292 --> 00:57:12.732]  Presidents.
[00:57:14.333 --> 00:57:18.656]  You helped our nation celebrate its bicentennial in 1976.
[00:57:20.657 --> 00:57:30.624]  A state visit provides us with a brief opportunity to step back from our current preoccupations, to reflect on the very essence of our relationship.
[00:57:32.825 --> 00:57:39.970]  It gives us the chance to look back at how the stories of our two countries have been inextricably woven together.
[00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:45.093]  It is the moment to take stock of our present friendship.
[00:57:46.814 --> 00:57:51.579]  Rightly taking pleasure from its strengths, while never taking these for granted.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:58:02.048]  And it is the time to look forward, jointly renewing our commitment to a more prosperous, safer, and freer world.
[00:58:02.368 --> 00:58:02.588]  Yep.
[00:58:03.689 --> 00:58:04.470]  That's enough of her.
[00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:05.971]  Get that piece of filth off the air.
[00:58:06.031 --> 00:58:08.934]  Get that piece of that ugly piece of trash off my radio show.
[00:58:08.954 --> 00:58:09.294]  Thank you.
[00:58:10.197 --> 00:58:14.978]  That degenerate, shameful, ugly, unladylike, boorish pig!
[00:58:15.718 --> 00:58:23.659]  It's pig-like, you bitch, to sit there and close the roads down in London every day to train all your monkeys that you're their master!
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.280]  It's... it's... it's maggot-like!
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:29.240]  You're a boorish, greedy hog!
[00:58:29.541 --> 00:58:31.281]  You're behind eugenics everything!
[00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:34.021]  You're not a lady, you're a piece of trash!
[00:58:34.261 --> 00:58:35.662]  Now get out of my country!
[00:58:35.902 --> 00:58:37.482]  Get the hell out of my country!
[00:58:41.539 --> 00:58:46.625]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.541 --> 00:58:58.161]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.841 --> 00:58:59.882]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.622 --> 00:59:01.722]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.382 --> 00:59:03.183]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.943 --> 00:59:04.943]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.503 --> 00:59:09.164]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.684 --> 00:59:13.805]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.746 --> 00:59:16.766]  Jim Tucker's coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:16.806 --> 00:59:18.907]  God bless you all and thank you for joining me.
[00:59:18.967 --> 00:59:23.788]  I got a little bit angry in the last hour about the Queen of England humiliating the presidency in public.
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:33.667]  Looking at our president with hatred, the whole government worshipping her and calling her Her Majesty, and our leaders bowing to a monarch.
[00:59:35.988 --> 00:59:38.290]  But it's the antithesis of what this nation is.
[00:59:38.330 --> 00:59:39.551]  And you know, it doesn't stop there.
[00:59:40.151 --> 00:59:50.860]  Just 20 years ago, just 10 years ago, we still called elected representatives and their employees, our employees, public servants.
[00:59:52.901 --> 00:59:53.902]  Public servants.
[00:59:54.608 --> 00:59:55.709]  Statesmen, they got a duty.
[00:59:56.009 --> 00:59:58.451]  Now they're called authorities.
[00:59:59.191 --> 01:00:02.093]  Now they're called officials.
[01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:13.461]  Now they have all these titles, your honor, and they demand, and the mayors will stop and say, call me your honor.
[01:00:13.481 --> 01:00:19.285]  And Bush will blow up if you don't call him Mr. President to a reporter.
[01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:23.331]  Or he'll tell a blind reporter to take his glasses off to show respect.
[01:00:23.851 --> 01:00:27.273]  And the police call us civilians, when they're civilians too.
[01:00:27.613 --> 01:00:35.016]  To call us civilians means the government is military-run, or under Admiralty Law, which is British Imperial Law, and that is actually what we're under.
[01:00:35.276 --> 01:00:37.578]  See, cops don't know why they call us civilians now.
[01:00:38.118 --> 01:00:40.899]  They don't know why mayors call us and governors call us civilians.
[01:00:41.139 --> 01:00:45.021]  They don't know why they call their bosses authorities, officials.
[01:00:47.262 --> 01:00:48.363]  We're going into
[01:00:49.693 --> 01:00:50.754]  To ape behavior.
[01:00:52.034 --> 01:00:59.278]  Hearts of darkness, running up, stooping, bowing, and licking boots of scum that wear fancy badges and insignia.
[01:00:59.678 --> 01:01:02.479]  What do you think a crown is that she wore at that dinner last night?
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.141]  It's a badge of, I'm above all of you!
[01:01:05.441 --> 01:01:08.022]  Look, I've got a bigger head crest than you!
[01:01:08.262 --> 01:01:10.083]  Like some type of parrot!
[01:01:11.083 --> 01:01:12.024]  We're bigger than that!
[01:01:14.531 --> 01:01:22.896]  We should be admired and get the head of the table in society for what we built, or what we designed, or who we stood up for, or who we saved, or what courage we showed.
[01:01:22.916 --> 01:01:28.279]  And when you have that, you get a nation that had over 90% of the world's patents.
[01:01:28.479 --> 01:01:33.561]  You get a nation that had 4% of the wealth, and 4% of the population and half the world's wealth.
[01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:41.466]  Because there was liberty, and there was freedom, and you got a head for who you were, and what you could build, and what you knew.
[01:01:42.606 --> 01:01:46.867]  Not because you wore some big black top hat or some big crown.
[01:01:48.167 --> 01:01:50.008]  Like the biggest parrot in the bunch.
[01:01:50.288 --> 01:01:57.229]  And all the other birds have to sit below that parrot and sit there and preen and chirp and beg and come up and groom you.
[01:01:57.549 --> 01:01:58.989]  I'm not gonna groom you.
[01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:01.710]  You are the lowest of the low.
[01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:06.231]  And know that the spirit of America still beats in this audience's heart.
[01:02:06.974 --> 01:02:13.018]  And know that the United States still stands against you, despite your attempt to destroy our borders and bring down our sovereignty.
[01:02:13.258 --> 01:02:15.679]  And we know you're the eternal enemy!
[01:02:15.699 --> 01:02:21.143]  And I pray God reveal you as the eternal enemy of this nation!
[01:02:22.744 --> 01:02:29.168]  Now the good news is, the cover-up of 9-11 has imploded in all the major polls.
[01:02:29.924 --> 01:02:34.285]  And we told you that we woke up Bruce Willis thanks to Rick Linklater giving him my videos a year ago.
[01:02:34.906 --> 01:02:36.326]  The neocons tried to spin that.
[01:02:36.346 --> 01:02:41.328]  He has now gone public in a Vanity Fair interview saying a shadow government runs the United States.
[01:02:42.788 --> 01:02:45.249]  That it's run things since they killed JFK.
[01:02:45.269 --> 01:02:46.809]  It's actually worse than that.
[01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:51.031]  It was going on since they set up the Royal Institute of International Affairs and then had the coup d'etat in 33.
[01:02:51.071 --> 01:02:55.552]  The military rule was set up or Admiralty British Maritime Law.
[01:02:56.032 --> 01:02:57.633]  That's official documents by the way.
[01:02:59.145 --> 01:03:03.728]  But he's really starting to get it now, and he says he may get killed for it, knowing the type of danger.
[01:03:03.788 --> 01:03:06.650]  And the key is, he is the ultimate prize here.
[01:03:07.731 --> 01:03:09.112]  Maybe a Schwarzenegger would be bigger.
[01:03:09.212 --> 01:03:13.155]  Coming out of the darkness, admitting he'd been co-opted, admitting he'd been used.
[01:03:13.195 --> 01:03:16.097]  He's a big neocon icon.
[01:03:16.117 --> 01:03:22.862]  He's not a neocon himself, but he was one of their... This would have been like Pat Tillman if he could have made it back to the U.S.
[01:03:22.922 --> 01:03:26.044]  and been anti-war, as he was saying he was going to do before they capped him.
[01:03:26.464 --> 01:03:28.466]  This is bigger than Pat Tillman defecting.
[01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:30.988]  That's why they're not attacking him in the hit pieces.
[01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:33.769]  That's why they're just hoping it doesn't get picked up on.
[01:03:33.789 --> 01:03:37.412]  That's why they're hoping his 9-11 and JFK comments go unnoticed.
[01:03:37.732 --> 01:03:42.275]  That's why you gotta go to PrisonPlano.com and get the new article that Paul Watson wrote.
[01:03:42.415 --> 01:03:44.877]  And I mean get it to the four wins now!
[01:03:45.357 --> 01:03:46.918]  This is an action alert!
[01:03:47.439 --> 01:03:48.399]  Action alert!
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:52.382]  Let's break the blackout on the Bruce Willis story!
[01:03:56.247 --> 01:04:01.732]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.092 --> 01:04:09.718]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.433 --> 01:04:17.477]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.878 --> 01:04:29.305]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.625 --> 01:04:33.187]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.587 --> 01:04:35.508]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.848 --> 01:04:39.691]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.304 --> 01:04:56.865]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:04:56.905 --> 01:04:57.406]  are located?
[01:04:57.626 --> 01:05:01.007]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:05:01.227 --> 01:05:05.928]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[01:05:42.623 --> 01:05:44.604]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer!
[01:05:44.684 --> 01:05:46.945]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[01:06:00.612 --> 01:06:01.733]  For a while, anyway.
[01:06:02.254 --> 01:06:05.417]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[01:06:06.037 --> 01:06:08.379]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:12.183]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:06:12.543 --> 01:06:14.805]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:06:15.346 --> 01:06:16.067]  What's the name again?
[01:06:16.087 --> 01:06:17.448]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:06:17.848 --> 01:06:18.649]  It's CalX.
[01:06:18.949 --> 01:06:19.169]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.180]  What makes Cal-X ointment so different?
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:31.722]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:06:32.742 --> 01:06:37.303]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:06:37.523 --> 01:06:46.625]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:06:47.345 --> 01:06:48.446]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[01:06:48.506 --> 01:06:49.166]  I'll be right back.
[01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:50.346]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:58.016]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.376 --> 01:07:00.717]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:03.478 --> 01:07:05.958]  Well, for over 30 years he's covered Bilderberg.
[01:07:05.978 --> 01:07:07.759]  He's been to over 27 of the meetings.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.400]  And I just talked to him.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.701]  They are sure now of where it's being held.
[01:07:14.741 --> 01:07:19.282]  The country and the city, not the exact location.
[01:07:20.931 --> 01:07:22.351]  And they know the date now.
[01:07:22.391 --> 01:07:23.652]  This is going to be breaking news.
[01:07:24.312 --> 01:07:24.732]  It's funny.
[01:07:24.752 --> 01:07:26.532]  The CBC called here this morning.
[01:07:27.613 --> 01:07:30.373]  The big Canadian broadcasting system.
[01:07:31.374 --> 01:07:34.875]  And they wanted to interview us about this.
[01:07:34.895 --> 01:07:35.655]  And we're more than happy to.
[01:07:35.675 --> 01:07:36.495]  But I said, hey, you're lucky.
[01:07:36.535 --> 01:07:37.435]  Jim Tucker's on today.
[01:07:37.795 --> 01:07:40.076]  So they're tuned in right now, wanting to know where it's going to be held.
[01:07:41.456 --> 01:07:43.737]  Obviously, whet their appetite and their interest.
[01:07:44.157 --> 01:07:47.758]  Peted, as they say, that it was in Ottawa, the capital of Canada.
[01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:50.176]  Last year I covered that there.
[01:07:50.656 --> 01:07:52.677]  That was my virgin maiden voyage.
[01:07:54.057 --> 01:07:55.378]  I will not be going to Istanbul.
[01:07:55.778 --> 01:08:01.601]  Jim's been shot at, locked up before, kidnapped, interrogated, and now he's going to Istanbul.
[01:08:01.641 --> 01:08:03.261]  Boy, that is a Turkish jail.
[01:08:03.321 --> 01:08:03.881]  Sounds fun.
[01:08:04.342 --> 01:08:05.822]  And yes, I just got the cat out of the bag.
[01:08:06.142 --> 01:08:09.604]  Where it's going to be held, they've confirmed, we'll go to Jim in just one moment.
[01:08:10.204 --> 01:08:14.849]  I first off want to encourage all of you to get his book, Bilderberg Diary, that came out last year.
[01:08:15.689 --> 01:08:20.534]  It is a great read, filled with photos he and others took going back over 20 years.
[01:08:21.374 --> 01:08:22.996]  You want to be an expert on Bilderberg.
[01:08:23.116 --> 01:08:24.277]  Every page is riveting.
[01:08:24.833 --> 01:08:26.874]  Where he confronts David Rockefeller and Larry.
[01:08:27.534 --> 01:08:31.517]  Maybe we'll get to talk about some of those stories that are in Bilderberg Diary, Dick Cheney, you name it.
[01:08:32.017 --> 01:08:34.758]  It is a must-have book, Bilderberg Diary.
[01:08:35.259 --> 01:08:39.381]  The most definitive, it's a short volume, easy read book out there.
[01:08:39.421 --> 01:08:43.683]  Club Bilderberg by Estalin is excellent as well, but is a long read comparatively.
[01:08:44.303 --> 01:08:49.066]  You need to get Bilderberg Diary by Jim Tucker, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:08:50.857 --> 01:08:54.119]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 888-253-3139 or send, what is it, $14.95 to 3001.

[01:09:19.814 --> 01:09:20.715]  I've made 15 of them.
[01:09:20.995 --> 01:09:23.457]  The latest is Terror Storm, history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:09:23.737 --> 01:09:25.738]  We carry America Freedom to Fascism as low as $9.95.
[01:09:25.818 --> 01:09:28.420]  You're not going to find anywhere else that low.
[01:09:29.381 --> 01:09:33.103]  We have my three Police State films now on a three DVD box set.
[01:09:33.443 --> 01:09:37.226]  Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement,

[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.622]  That's right, the film is $34.95.
[01:09:43.662 --> 01:09:47.904]  Three films, $34.95, the classics, remastered on three DVDs, in one box, 45% off.
[01:09:47.924 --> 01:09:50.846]  As the dollar implodes in value, we're cutting prices.
[01:09:57.390 --> 01:10:02.091]  It's just about getting the word out, and we hope and pray that we get enough orders to continue operating.
[01:10:02.411 --> 01:10:03.351]  That's how you donate.
[01:10:03.692 --> 01:10:04.872]  That's how you support us.

[01:10:57.550 --> 01:11:00.072]  I want to thank all the members of PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:11:00.832 --> 01:11:16.623]  Last night I was here until 1 in the morning again, and I just was reading letters, scanning through probably, I don't know, 30 or so letters that came in just the last week, you know, handwritten letters, scanning them, trying to read it all.
[01:11:20.612 --> 01:11:22.873]  I don't even have time to come on here and thank you for all those.
[01:11:23.333 --> 01:11:24.394]  I want to thank you for the letters.
[01:11:25.074 --> 01:11:26.315]  And I want to thank you for the support.
[01:11:27.055 --> 01:11:29.057]  And I want to thank you for being part of this historical fight.
[01:11:29.417 --> 01:11:30.457]  Alright, enough from me.
[01:11:31.458 --> 01:11:32.138]  Jim Tucker.
[01:11:32.218 --> 01:11:35.360]  Jim, for those that don't know who you are, we have new listeners every millisecond.
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:40.263]  Will you please tell folks a little bit about yourself growing up on the cotton farm?
[01:11:40.871 --> 01:11:41.892]  It's always a pleasure.
[01:11:41.972 --> 01:11:43.833]  As far as early history is concerned, I grew up on a 40-acre
[01:12:11.059 --> 01:12:15.342]  Hardscrabble Cotton Farm in North Carolina, been going downhill ever since.
[01:12:17.563 --> 01:12:21.706]  My first 20 years were with the establishment newspapers.
[01:12:21.726 --> 01:12:26.389]  I was a night editor for the Washington Daily News until it went belly up in 72.
[01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:30.191]  I was on copy desk for the Richmond Times Dispatch.
[01:12:30.991 --> 01:12:38.256]  I was assistant news editor for the Afton Beacon Journal, editor of smaller dailies like the Martinsville, Virginia newspaper.
[01:12:39.102 --> 01:12:44.605]  I had never heard the word Bilderberg in my life until, I believe it was April of 1975.
[01:12:45.325 --> 01:12:54.370]  I was being interviewed by Willis Carter, the founder of Liberty Lobby, for the job of getting pregnant and creating a weekly journal called The Spotlight.
[01:12:55.251 --> 01:12:57.172]  And he asked me what I thought about Bilderberg.
[01:12:57.912 --> 01:12:58.812]  I had never heard of them.
[01:13:00.253 --> 01:13:01.874]  At first I didn't take it seriously.
[01:13:01.934 --> 01:13:02.734]  No, it's not possible.
[01:13:02.794 --> 01:13:07.417]  I could spend 20 happy years with major newspapers, all the wires clicking at my
[01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:11.104]  Uh, earlobes, and not be aware of a group such as this.
[01:13:11.984 --> 01:13:26.326]  So he gave me a lot of material, uh, the newsletters, uh, produced by Liberty Lobby exposing Billerberg, and most intriguingly, uh, two columns written by the late and great Westbrook Pegler in 1957.
[01:13:27.206 --> 01:13:35.488]  He did not know they were called Billerberg, but he got a tip that some luminaries were meeting off of an island, uh, in Georgia as I recall.
[01:13:36.235 --> 01:13:54.500]  Needed two lengthy columns identifying, by sight and through binoculars, those who attended, describing the security, the fact that the place was sealed, the resort was sealed off, and only these luminaries were attending, and raised the very obvious question we've raised all these years.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.360]  Why are they meeting?
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:57.441]  Why the secrecy?
[01:13:58.201 --> 01:14:02.542]  If they're doing good, why are they embarrassed for anybody to know?
[01:14:03.086 --> 01:14:05.368]  And they denied their very existence for a lot of years.
[01:14:05.428 --> 01:14:11.792]  They published the newspapers in Europe, giving a lot of attention now that we started collaborating about 15 years ago.
[01:14:11.812 --> 01:14:17.656]  So, the line no longer is that we don't exist, it's your imagination.
[01:14:18.317 --> 01:14:23.441]  But it is, we do nothing, we only do good.
[01:14:23.461 --> 01:14:29.345]  And the unwashed multitude should be grateful for the wonderful things we do for them that we can't tell you about.
[01:14:30.447 --> 01:14:35.170]  But some of the things they do, I think, a lot of people find less than wonderful.
[01:14:35.690 --> 01:14:53.022]  Well, even the BBC had to report, years after denying they even existed and saying we were all insane, a few years ago they got some of the founding recordings and documents of Bilderberg, where in 1954 they were charting how to set up the European Union by stealth, and now they're the prime movers behind the American Union.
[01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:56.204]  And it's just the fact they've been caught lying so much.
[01:14:56.584 --> 01:15:01.788]  The problem is a lot of the owners of the major media conglomerates are Bilderberg Group members.
[01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:03.289]  And so what do you expect?
[01:15:03.369 --> 01:15:04.210]  Of course they're going to lie.
[01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:12.535]  Yes, executives of the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and Washington Post have all attended meetings.
[01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:14.897]  In fact, Donald Crimm,
[01:15:16.036 --> 01:15:22.918]  And Jimmy Lee Hoagland, the associate editor of the Washington Post, Don Graham's the publisher, Jimmy Lee Hoagland's the associate editor.
[01:15:22.938 --> 01:15:27.659]  They attend every year, as did Mrs. Graham, until she died.
[01:15:27.779 --> 01:15:38.942]  And before her, Phil Graham, the publisher since 1954 or something, 40-something, of the Washington Post, attended all the meetings.
[01:15:40.042 --> 01:15:43.023]  And they make that solemn promise to reveal nothing.
[01:15:43.889 --> 01:15:48.731]  Anytime the word Bilderberg gets into a newspaper, one of those newspapers, it's an accident.
[01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:52.853]  A few years ago, an old Bilderberg boy decides to die at a Bilderberg meeting.
[01:15:53.774 --> 01:15:58.456]  And the obituary writer pointed out that he attended a Bilderberg meeting.
[01:15:59.196 --> 01:16:05.299]  Well, you can't tell the whole 900-man news staff that the New York Times don't use this word, so it didn't hurt them much.
[01:16:06.811 --> 01:16:17.615]  A few people, there's so many glitches and so forth that probably the word Billiberg escaped the attention of most of the readers anyway, but they do have that rule.
[01:16:18.075 --> 01:16:21.936]  Nothing is reported, and they keep that rule at all costs.
[01:16:23.176 --> 01:16:31.299]  Now Jim, we're going to have a break here, and I want to come back and then break the big news in detail of where the meeting is going to be held and what intel you've got and the date.
[01:16:32.296 --> 01:16:41.004]  But as an American patriot, what is it like to see the White House groveling and begging to the Queen of England, and the media saying, how dare Bush not show her proper respect?
[01:16:41.705 --> 01:16:47.530]  I mean, does it disgust you to see this worship of royalty and the worship of Queen Beatrix that goes on in Bilderberg?
[01:16:48.411 --> 01:16:57.980]  Royalty always did bother me, but oddly, in the culture of England, those guys on the dole in Colton Myers in Northern England,
[01:16:58.861 --> 01:17:06.447]  If you said, cut back the huge allowances given to the Queen or to Bonnie Prince Charles, they'd say no, no, they'd be outraged.
[01:17:06.887 --> 01:17:10.390]  They love their royalty for some reason.
[01:17:11.271 --> 01:17:12.352]  Most Americans don't.
[01:17:12.972 --> 01:17:20.598]  And while I think we should be gracious to the Queen, certainly such silly rules as when the Queen's through eating, everybody's through eating.
[01:17:20.618 --> 01:17:22.079]  I mean, all those silly rules.
[01:17:22.759 --> 01:17:27.183]  If I've still got a good steak in front of me and she's already through eating, I'm not going to waste that good steak.
[01:17:29.068 --> 01:17:30.329]  Well, you say, be gracious.
[01:17:30.369 --> 01:17:34.710]  She's, I mean, I'm not going to be gracious for her, that New World Order trash.
[01:17:35.171 --> 01:17:37.571]  Her and her husband pushed the whole globalist agenda.
[01:17:38.012 --> 01:17:42.634]  And exactly, the President's supposed to walk behind her when she's done eating, like the alpha monkey.
[01:17:42.674 --> 01:17:43.794]  We're supposed to all stop?
[01:17:44.334 --> 01:17:49.076]  I mean, this is our ancestral enemy, Jim.
[01:17:49.556 --> 01:17:58.540]  Yes, by saying, be gracious, I mean, not by shouting obscenities in her face, but say, if she says, good morning, say, good morning.
[01:17:59.628 --> 01:18:00.609]  Well, you are a gentleman.
[01:18:02.612 --> 01:18:05.115]  Well, that's the way Baptists were reared down south.
[01:18:05.696 --> 01:18:06.277]  I understand.
[01:18:06.337 --> 01:18:08.660]  Well, I was reared like that too, but not for her.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.805]  I make a point of not being a gentleman because she doesn't deserve it.
[01:18:13.826 --> 01:18:15.068]  It's just disgusting.
[01:18:17.309 --> 01:18:21.773]  Jim, when we get back, let's get into the big news for everybody, then I want to take some calls.
[01:18:22.174 --> 01:18:33.804]  Folks, it's your chance to talk to Jim Tucker, specifically on the New World Order, on the Bilderberg Group, on royalty, on what Jim's intel he's been getting, on what's going to be big on their agenda this year.
[01:18:34.824 --> 01:18:42.809]  1-800-259-9231 AmericanFreePress.net AmericanFreePress.net is the website.
[01:18:42.829 --> 01:18:44.890]  We have links to it up on InforWars.com.
[01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:49.112]  Right now, the legendary and my good friend, Jim Tucker, on the other side.
[01:18:54.907 --> 01:18:55.948]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:18:56.268 --> 01:18:59.049]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:18:59.329 --> 01:19:03.472]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:19:03.892 --> 01:19:04.732]  So what do you do?
[01:19:05.052 --> 01:19:09.615]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:19:10.115 --> 01:19:12.237]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:19:12.717 --> 01:19:27.429]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:19:27.469 --> 01:19:34.515]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:55.193]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:19:55.253 --> 01:19:55.433]  May 8, 2007.
[01:19:55.633 --> 01:19:59.397]  Spot Gold 685.10 and 1 oz gold coins can be purchased for $706.96, $355.52 for 1 oz and $177.77 for 1 oz coins at $706.96, $355.52 and $177.77.
[01:20:11.050 --> 01:20:16.793]  There has been talk coming from the Council of Foreign Relations of forming an American Union combining Canada, Mexico, and the U.S.
[01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:18.294]  and erasing economic borders.
[01:20:18.514 --> 01:20:25.297]  Bush met with Vincent Fox, President of Mexico, Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, discussing a security and prosperity partnership.
[01:20:25.477 --> 01:20:29.039]  The formation of a North American Union will have a great impact on the U.S.
[01:20:29.099 --> 01:20:29.579]  economy.
[01:20:29.839 --> 01:20:34.562]  Jerome R. Corsi published the document, The Plan to Replace the Dollar with the Emerald.
[01:20:34.802 --> 01:20:36.222]  The sovereignty of the U.S.
[01:20:36.483 --> 01:20:37.183]  is under attack.
[01:20:37.663 --> 01:20:41.025]  And Corsi uncovers the secrets and lies that surround the deceit.

[01:20:49.710 --> 01:20:50.070]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:50.170 --> 01:20:55.773]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.394 --> 01:21:05.579]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[01:21:06.562 --> 01:21:13.344]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:15.705]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:21:15.925 --> 01:21:18.986]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[01:21:19.966 --> 01:21:28.489]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:53.474 --> 01:21:54.615]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[01:21:54.635 --> 01:21:57.036]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[01:21:57.156 --> 01:22:00.138]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[01:22:00.198 --> 01:22:00.878]  is a real thing.
[01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:07.802]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[01:22:07.962 --> 01:22:13.245]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[01:22:13.405 --> 01:22:14.166]  We're good to go!
[01:22:40.228 --> 01:22:43.749]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[01:22:43.829 --> 01:22:44.649]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:47.589]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:48.910]  Back to the royalty situation.
[01:23:06.684 --> 01:23:09.205]  They train you with peer pressure that everyone has to grovel.
[01:23:09.285 --> 01:23:11.206]  And they say, will you follow proper etiquette?
[01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:13.827]  Will you let her extend her hand?
[01:23:13.867 --> 01:23:15.388]  Will you stop eating when she eats?
[01:23:15.468 --> 01:23:16.708]  Will you grovel to her?
[01:23:17.029 --> 01:23:18.469]  Will you not look her in the eyes?
[01:23:19.730 --> 01:23:21.651]  There's reasons they do all those petty things.
[01:23:21.711 --> 01:23:24.832]  It's about making you submit to their will.
[01:23:25.992 --> 01:23:28.273]  That's why I called her those names in the first hour.
[01:23:29.134 --> 01:23:29.674]  That's why.
[01:23:29.774 --> 01:23:32.515]  Because I do not submit to your will, scum!
[01:23:33.436 --> 01:23:33.896]  I'm sorry.
[01:23:35.214 --> 01:23:37.476]  Again, our police call us civilians now.
[01:23:37.716 --> 01:23:40.999]  The government's called authorities, officials, no longer servants.
[01:23:41.379 --> 01:23:42.380]  Words mean things.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:45.882]  This is a craft of control and serfdom they're using.
[01:23:46.563 --> 01:23:53.008]  Jim Tucker of American Free Press, the author of Bilderberg Diary that we carry, and Infowars.com.
[01:23:53.048 --> 01:23:54.529]  Again, we're honored to have my friend on.
[01:23:55.090 --> 01:24:00.054]  I wish I could be with you there in Istanbul, but I'm a bit busy finishing a film about you.
[01:24:00.574 --> 01:24:04.297]  You're one of the main characters in my new in-game film about the world government.
[01:24:04.978 --> 01:24:07.400]  Jim Tucker, in the short segment we have, give us the intel dump data
[01:24:27.619 --> 01:24:36.482]  What you learned from your sources, where it's being held, and the one piece of data you're still lacking that you're even asking the media and the listeners to help you discover.
[01:24:37.242 --> 01:24:47.545]  Yes, we're 100% sure they'll meet May 31 through June 3, or whatever Sunday is, at Istanbul, Turkey.
[01:24:48.186 --> 01:24:48.786]  Just where?
[01:24:48.946 --> 01:24:49.586]  We don't know yet.
[01:24:49.626 --> 01:24:50.606]  We're still working on that.
[01:24:53.115 --> 01:25:11.700]  Betty is supposed to suggest once we have to drive around and look for resorts with the cops surrounded by cops with those sawhorses outside but we still have a lot of people working on it and I'm very hopeful of having the precise site before I get there because that's always very helpful.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:19.041]  I'll have my travel itinerary ready by Monday morning because I do have to make the commitment to be there wherever they might be.
[01:25:19.061 --> 01:25:21.282]  So it's a touch and go yet.
[01:25:23.257 --> 01:25:26.318]  Alright, now again this is breaking news ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:26.358 --> 01:25:28.719]  I haven't even seen a column from you yet on this.
[01:25:28.779 --> 01:25:35.762]  I heard a mention that you guys might think it could be in Turkey, but now you've narrowed it down to Turkey and Istanbul.
[01:25:35.862 --> 01:25:37.542]  Breaking news here, Jim.
[01:25:37.562 --> 01:25:40.343]  We appreciate you sharing this with us.
[01:25:41.364 --> 01:25:50.887]  Now, have you ever gone to a conference not knowing the exact location in a city, or do you think you will learn before you go there at the end of this month?
[01:25:52.009 --> 01:26:00.475]  I'm very hopeful of learning before leaving, but we did have one this close one time, one of the same sources, still working on trying to pin down the location.
[01:26:00.495 --> 01:26:11.363]  I'm not at liberty to give his name, but he's a retired financial consultant who's actually had Billberg members as clients, and he's helped us for 20-some years.
[01:26:21.469 --> 01:26:23.490]  Well, we're going to someplace in Europe.
[01:26:23.771 --> 01:26:27.272]  I'm actually backing up to see if I can pin it down.
[01:26:32.095 --> 01:26:34.996]  Oh yes, we were going to Brussels in 2000.
[01:26:36.096 --> 01:26:37.657]  We knew it was in the Brussels area.
[01:26:37.717 --> 01:26:38.458]  We knew the dates.
[01:26:38.918 --> 01:26:40.378]  Still did not know exactly where.
[01:26:41.359 --> 01:26:47.562]  And I'm at the National Press Club with my other pair of socks and typewriter in hand.
[01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:51.378]  Waiting for a jitney to take me to Dulles Airport.
[01:26:52.299 --> 01:26:55.502]  And I got a call from this guy, and he said, bingo, we've got him.
[01:26:55.522 --> 01:26:57.884]  He named the precise location.
[01:26:57.944 --> 01:27:02.107]  I was able to call Spotlight back in town to remake page one with the precise location.
[01:27:03.148 --> 01:27:03.808]  And he was right.
[01:27:04.549 --> 01:27:05.910]  It was that close.
[01:27:07.471 --> 01:27:13.096]  Down to the very hour I was to head for the airport before I got the precise location.
[01:27:13.916 --> 01:27:14.777]  Of course, he had to call me
[01:27:16.553 --> 01:27:24.300]  Knowing the hotel I'll be checking into, he'll call me the next day at the hotel, but still, there's no such thing as knowing too soon.
[01:27:39.139 --> 01:27:39.339]  Yes.
[01:27:39.399 --> 01:27:41.021]  Now, I don't think they're going to make a big switch.
[01:27:41.081 --> 01:27:41.741]  They only tried that once.
[01:27:41.761 --> 01:27:47.867]  Even for powerful guys like this, they know probably three years ahead of what resort they'll be in because they have to put up a nice fat deposit to tell
[01:28:07.137 --> 01:28:11.420]  This resort, nobody but us Bilderberg people, us members and our staff.
[01:28:13.381 --> 01:28:21.205]  And your staff has to be carefully screened with new employees, put on furlough during the meeting so that we can have absolute security.
[01:28:21.785 --> 01:28:24.127]  Now to do that you do have to work two or three years in advance.
[01:28:25.007 --> 01:28:31.791]  And when they tried, they got mad at Austria because they had a free election in which young George Heider did well.
[01:28:32.697 --> 01:28:38.619]  And all the politically correct groups such as Dillberg decide to abandon Austria.
[01:28:38.699 --> 01:28:39.339]  Stay there, Jim.
[01:28:39.359 --> 01:28:39.919]  We got a break.
[01:28:39.939 --> 01:28:41.660]  We'll talk about your security when we get back.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:44.700]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.761]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.781 --> 01:28:50.382]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.536 --> 01:28:57.578]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:28:57.798 --> 01:29:01.200]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:29:01.361 --> 01:29:05.083]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:29:05.103 --> 01:29:08.325]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:29:08.345 --> 01:29:13.147]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:29:14.488 --> 01:29:15.029]  Thank you.
[01:29:30.928 --> 01:29:35.351]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:29:35.371 --> 01:29:36.812]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:29:36.972 --> 01:29:40.854]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:29:40.874 --> 01:29:41.714]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[01:29:53.413 --> 01:30:00.398]  When my son started having behavior problems, the total transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[01:30:00.618 --> 01:30:01.879]  We got immediate results.
[01:30:02.199 --> 01:30:06.922]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual when he's disrespectful, defiant, or even abusive?
[01:30:07.222 --> 01:30:08.023]  Do you know how to fix it?
[01:30:08.443 --> 01:30:13.827]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior right now with the Total Transformation.
[01:30:14.127 --> 01:30:17.129]  The program that helps you fix every behavior problem under the sun.
[01:30:17.529 --> 01:30:22.530]  Defiance, back talking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.
[01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:25.511]  There's no screaming, no fighting, no frustration.
[01:30:25.811 --> 01:30:30.772]  The Total Transformation is the program I've used for over 30 years to solve even the worst behavior problems.
[01:30:31.112 --> 01:30:34.853]  Your child will listen to you again and you'll get peace and sanity back into your home.
[01:30:35.173 --> 01:30:35.834]  I guarantee it.
[01:30:36.214 --> 01:30:40.415]  Call now and get how to turn your child's attitude around in one minute or less free with your order.
[01:30:41.135 --> 01:30:41.355]  Call now!
[01:30:41.375 --> 01:30:41.435]  1-800-373-0402
[01:30:53.257 --> 01:30:57.759]  Summer is once again just around the corner, and as usual, so are higher gas prices.
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:01.381]  This year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back.
[01:31:01.822 --> 01:31:09.906]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[01:31:10.846 --> 01:31:17.410]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised, Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem, unburned fuel.
[01:31:17.850 --> 01:31:21.572]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[01:31:22.052 --> 01:31:26.894]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[01:31:27.294 --> 01:31:33.896]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[01:31:34.516 --> 01:31:36.097]  And it's so easy to use.
[01:31:36.577 --> 01:31:42.479]  Simply pour a couple of ounces into your tank at every fill-up and you're on your way to saving money and the environment.
[01:31:42.939 --> 01:31:49.322]  So, do yourself and the environment a favor and visit ctsavegas.com to get your bottle today.
[01:31:49.602 --> 01:31:52.503]  That's ctsavegas.com.
[01:31:58.505 --> 01:32:02.467]  This is not America worshipping royals, bowing to them.
[01:32:08.792 --> 01:32:11.353]  We've come so far in America.
[01:32:33.115 --> 01:32:42.479]  To call our elected representatives, our servants, the officials, the authorities, and we bow to the scum leader of royalty.
[01:32:42.999 --> 01:32:50.662]  They are the world leaders of royalty, the world leaders of crime, the world leaders of the new world order with a Rothschild scum that's married in with them.
[01:32:52.222 --> 01:32:56.504]  And they're here with our president bowing and scooping and fetching.
[01:32:57.324 --> 01:32:58.524]  Well, Jim Tucker doesn't bow.
[01:32:58.624 --> 01:32:59.905]  Richard, Rick,
[01:33:01.586 --> 01:33:03.974]  Daniel, Brad and others, we're going to go to your calls here in a few minutes.
[01:33:05.279 --> 01:33:08.522]  For Jim Tucker, we got some calls asking about his book.
[01:33:08.962 --> 01:33:10.583]  It's Bilderberg Diary.
[01:33:10.884 --> 01:33:12.605]  Jim, you can describe it better than I can.
[01:33:12.625 --> 01:33:21.492]  For folks that want to buy it from our secure online video and bookstore at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:33:21.812 --> 01:33:30.819]  Before we get into Estanbul and your security and what you think is going to be on the agenda there and then calls, tell the listeners, please, sir, just in a nutshell about your book.
[01:33:30.839 --> 01:33:32.661]  Because, I mean, it is a book I couldn't put down.
[01:33:33.354 --> 01:33:40.556]  And I've read it about four times because, you know, I use some of it as a blueprint to do research for the film I'm making.
[01:33:40.936 --> 01:33:50.979]  A large section of Endgame is centering in and around Bilderberg as kind of the central spoke of the wheel that makes the film up, the central part of the historical plot line.
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.780]  But tell us about Bilderberg Diary.
[01:33:55.001 --> 01:34:00.923]  Well, Bilderberg Diary covers Bilderberg beings all the way up to and including
[01:34:03.829 --> 01:34:24.904]  2005, when we were all in, uh, through sometimes my twilight years, I get confused, but over the, uh, Bilderberg meetings over the years, these things that affect Americans, all the way through, uh, yeah, 2005, when we were, uh,
[01:34:28.922 --> 01:34:30.883]  Not including last year, 2005.
[01:34:31.143 --> 01:34:38.987]  It's richly illustrated, as you said, one of my favorite photos is confronting Henry Kissinger and asking him.
[01:34:39.767 --> 01:34:43.729]  At that time, I was at some kind of reception.
[01:34:44.469 --> 01:34:47.530]  Dr. Kissinger, the Bilderberg meeting, name of the site and time and so forth.
[01:34:47.951 --> 01:34:50.592]  This quiet-haired old European said this to you.
[01:34:50.652 --> 01:34:51.572]  What was your response?
[01:34:52.092 --> 01:34:54.173]  His first answer was, I'm indignant.
[01:34:54.593 --> 01:34:55.674]  That was a private meeting.
[01:34:56.465 --> 01:34:58.667]  Then he remembered to affect his German accent.
[01:34:58.927 --> 01:35:00.288]  That was a private meeting.
[01:35:01.169 --> 01:35:02.710]  Jim, I'm going to have to stop you.
[01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:04.572]  Somebody got a line crossed with you.
[01:35:04.632 --> 01:35:06.914]  I heard it dial and then somebody answered.
[01:35:06.934 --> 01:35:10.557]  I don't want a private conversation out of American Free Press going out over the air.
[01:35:10.577 --> 01:35:12.498]  Can you look around and see who's on your line?
[01:35:13.439 --> 01:35:15.601]  Who's on line one?
[01:35:17.662 --> 01:35:18.643]  Put him on hold real quick.
[01:35:19.564 --> 01:35:20.905]  That happens in newsrooms, folks.
[01:35:20.965 --> 01:35:21.405]  It's okay.
[01:35:21.465 --> 01:35:22.566]  It's standard.
[01:35:22.606 --> 01:35:23.227]  I just don't want
[01:35:24.344 --> 01:35:29.726]  I was in horror there, hoping whoever it was would figure out that they were... I'm sure a lot of you listeners could hear it.
[01:35:29.786 --> 01:35:35.728]  It was dialing, and then I heard talking start up, and I didn't want to... Go ahead and bring Jim back up.
[01:35:35.768 --> 01:35:36.528]  Did we get that fixed?
[01:35:39.610 --> 01:35:40.230]  It's okay, Jim.
[01:35:40.410 --> 01:35:42.711]  Please continue with the Henry Kissinger story.
[01:35:42.731 --> 01:35:42.991]  Sorry.
[01:35:43.891 --> 01:35:44.671]  Sir, are we clear now?
[01:35:45.132 --> 01:35:45.652]  Yes, we are, sir.
[01:35:49.338 --> 01:35:52.119]  Well, it demonstrates what an effective person he is.
[01:35:52.159 --> 01:35:54.481]  He's been in this country since he was 14 years old.
[01:35:55.201 --> 01:35:57.182]  He's deep into his 80s now.
[01:35:57.842 --> 01:36:06.026]  His brother, they tell me, who I do not know, speaks English like a native, but he affects that German accent for some reason.
[01:36:06.046 --> 01:36:10.309]  These guys are all pompous asses.
[01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:17.072]  In fact, reminiscing of your comments about the Queen, the staff at a Bilderberg
[01:36:18.012 --> 01:36:18.732]  We're good to go.
[01:36:41.182 --> 01:36:44.904]  You must not look me in the eye if I'm a Bilderberg boy.
[01:36:44.924 --> 01:36:47.886]  Those kinds of silly affectations always abuse me.
[01:36:48.247 --> 01:36:50.008]  Well that's dog training.
[01:36:50.048 --> 01:36:52.450]  We have to act like little trained animals around them.
[01:36:52.910 --> 01:37:01.516]  This is all part of their control and their domination of us and that's why I find them so disgusting and I detest them.
[01:37:02.297 --> 01:37:03.518]  What about your security?
[01:37:03.778 --> 01:37:07.340]  Have you ever done something there that far into the east?
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:09.402]  Have you ever gone to a Bilderberg meeting in Turkey?
[01:37:10.816 --> 01:37:12.377]  No, I've never gone to Turkey before.
[01:37:12.397 --> 01:37:15.458]  This is the first time they've met since about 1974 or so.
[01:37:15.478 --> 01:37:19.921]  Shortly before I hooked up with Spotlight.
[01:37:21.781 --> 01:37:23.282]  This is our second time in Turkey.
[01:37:24.022 --> 01:37:25.103]  It's been 30 some years.
[01:37:26.964 --> 01:37:27.944]  I've never been to Turkey before.
[01:37:28.625 --> 01:37:29.285]  Looking forward to it.
[01:37:30.922 --> 01:37:37.488]  Now you know, and I know you're fearless, you've climbed hedges and gone through drainage ditches and had them arrest you and been shot at.
[01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:45.354]  You always want to be clear, they shot over your head, so it's no big deal with it impacting on the brick above you.
[01:37:46.135 --> 01:37:49.258]  No big deal, of course, but it is a big deal, Jim.
[01:37:49.498 --> 01:37:51.680]  You're going to Turkey, we need to all pray for you.
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:56.384]  You know, those Turks don't play games, that's a police state first rate.
[01:37:56.804 --> 01:37:56.984]  Yes.
[01:38:19.483 --> 01:38:27.206]  Well, I'll probably talk to you before leaving, but you'll get a copy of my itinerary so you'll know how to call me if I don't get through to you, but I'll try to get through to you.
[01:38:27.366 --> 01:38:35.769]  Sure, we did that last year while I was there with you, and this way we can track and chronicle and kind of watch your back, Jim.
[01:38:36.369 --> 01:38:44.132]  Yeah, well, last year's meeting didn't have the same dramatic results as the ones where we could do an enhanced story on the end of the Cold War.
[01:38:46.368 --> 01:38:51.589]  Bill Clinton's invasion of Kosovo, the downfall of Maggie Thatcher, whom they detested.
[01:38:53.250 --> 01:39:06.113]  But you'll recall that our lead story was about how they anticipated a housing collapse with all these young people being induced by not-headed bankers.
[01:39:06.394 --> 01:39:07.834]  I remember you said that last year!
[01:39:08.394 --> 01:39:11.535]  And you've been reading about it in the established newspapers ever since.
[01:39:12.706 --> 01:39:17.470]  In fact, you did write about that and cover that here on this very show in American Free Press last year.
[01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:18.671]  Now, that's a key point.
[01:39:18.691 --> 01:39:21.273]  You show the power of the Bilderberg Group, Jim.
[01:39:21.553 --> 01:39:24.896]  How many things have you learned a year or two in advance before it actually happened?
[01:39:25.557 --> 01:39:36.847]  Well, the most dramatic ones being the fact that they're going to toss Maggie Thatcher out as the Prime Minister of Britain because she resisted
[01:39:39.678 --> 01:39:40.398]  We're good to go.
[01:40:02.410 --> 01:40:16.515]  And she said, almost a direct quote, I remember she used the term, it's a tribute, tribute she said, to be denounced by Bilderberg, and had harsh things to say about any head of state who surrendered any sovereignty to an international body.
[01:40:16.535 --> 01:40:23.818]  And she attended one meeting, had nothing to say, they could not rope her into the conspiracy, so
[01:40:24.505 --> 01:40:30.188]  There's punishment, well also to advance their calls, which is having some problems in Europe now.
[01:40:30.208 --> 01:40:41.934]  The calls, European press, I'm talking about major newspapers with heavy page one coverage, photographs, heavy stories raising the question of what they're up to, photographs of the armed guards surrounding the place and all that.
[01:40:42.594 --> 01:40:43.835]  The Europeans are much more aware.
[01:40:43.955 --> 01:40:45.716]  I'm talking about major newspapers in Europe.
[01:40:46.412 --> 01:40:46.972]  I think so.
[01:40:58.734 --> 01:41:07.361]  That's right, we just had the EU expansion failure, free trade of the Americas collapsed, and Jim, you are a trailblazer whether you like it or not.
[01:41:07.401 --> 01:41:13.425]  I know Westbrook Pegler wrote two articles, but I mean, you know, he was kind of like Abraham and you're Moses.
[01:41:13.946 --> 01:41:21.091]  I mean, you really have had an effect globally for those 20 plus years that you went there when no one else was covering it.
[01:41:21.812 --> 01:41:23.673]  We owe you a great debt, Jim Tucker.
[01:41:23.853 --> 01:41:27.496]  Well, thank you much, but if we had the same coverage in this country,
[01:41:28.041 --> 01:41:39.771]  We wouldn't be talking about an American Union and giving up the dollar in favor of the Mario if we had the same coverage in this country that the people in Europe get regarding Vildenberg.
[01:41:39.811 --> 01:41:52.903]  But the blackout here is almost universally complete, which is not a condemnation of all 1,200 down from 1,800 American daily newspapers, called the small-town newspaper.
[01:41:54.057 --> 01:41:57.139]  It depends solely on the wires for state and world news.
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:03.764]  The small daily is trying to keep up with the high school football team and the church socials and the city council.
[01:42:04.544 --> 01:42:07.146]  So if it's not on the AP wire, it does not exist.
[01:42:08.503 --> 01:42:09.564]  It's not only APYR.
[01:42:10.045 --> 01:42:21.133]  Every year after Billeberg meeting, in this age of... Well, in these small-town papers, the readers of those just start demanding real coverage and to start demanding real research by their reporters.
[01:42:21.194 --> 01:42:24.957]  And in a few hours every day, they could have huge stories and up their readership.
[01:42:24.977 --> 01:42:31.742]  That's why their readership's imploding, because people don't want to only hear about what, you know, Sally Sockermom did.
[01:42:32.162 --> 01:42:37.507]  Yeah, it would be very helpful if readers would see Billeberg's story.
[01:42:38.067 --> 01:42:39.409]  We're good to go.
[01:42:48.237 --> 01:42:53.420]  It's the major dailies and broadcast networks live directly to conspiracy.
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:56.381]  The big issue is how to repair the European Union.
[01:43:10.291 --> 01:43:21.682]  In fact, just a recent poll, which deserves a Bildberg very much, shows that most British people would rather have no ties with the European Union just to get out of it altogether.
[01:43:21.702 --> 01:43:25.966]  They're not as much into it as the European Union wants them to be.
[01:43:26.066 --> 01:43:28.308]  They've got some polls that are in the mid-80s against it.
[01:43:28.649 --> 01:43:28.789]  Yeah.
[01:43:29.569 --> 01:43:31.732]  And that was not the plan at all.
[01:43:31.792 --> 01:43:33.914]  Everybody's supposed to embrace the European Union.
[01:43:33.934 --> 01:43:35.095]  It's supposed to, by now,
[01:43:35.635 --> 01:43:39.900]  Well, here's an example, Jim.
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.982]  They just had the 50th anniversary of the EU.
[01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:44.625]  And literally, we had the photos.
[01:43:45.026 --> 01:43:48.690]  They had jugglers and parades and million-dollar firework displays.
[01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:50.011]  No one showed up.
[01:43:50.171 --> 01:43:50.952]  Dead streets.
[01:43:51.453 --> 01:43:53.635]  You could almost hear the crickets.
[01:43:54.556 --> 01:43:55.517]  That is a testament.
[01:43:55.938 --> 01:43:57.019]  They are losing.
[01:43:58.324 --> 01:44:05.047]  Yes, I'd like for them to do a better job of losing in this hemisphere, the Western Hemisphere, like they are in Europe.
[01:44:05.547 --> 01:44:12.091]  That's why it's so important to pressure the media to give attention to Bilderberg.
[01:44:12.111 --> 01:44:14.512]  If they want to say Bilderberg's great guys, go ahead and say it.
[01:44:14.532 --> 01:44:22.855]  But they acknowledge their presence, the fact they exist, and the fact that their meetings are behind closed and locked doors, and they would prefer them to be 100% secret.
[01:44:26.135 --> 01:44:42.919]  I've also read some mainstream news articles, and I want to get your take on this, saying that Bilderberg's lost some of its luster for the members because it has been exposed to the public, and that it's still extremely, you know, influential and elite, but that it's lost some of its gleam due to your ferreting behavior.
[01:44:44.219 --> 01:44:46.339]  I didn't see that, but I'm glad to hear about it.
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:49.960]  Yeah, they've been reporting about it losing some of its luster.
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:50.940]  Do you have any comments on that?
[01:44:51.601 --> 01:44:53.381]  Well, I'm glad they're reporting it.
[01:44:54.575 --> 01:44:56.016]  I've not seen that reporting myself.
[01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:57.556]  What newspaper was it in?
[01:44:57.757 --> 01:45:00.858]  You know, I've been compiling literally scores of them for the film.
[01:45:00.918 --> 01:45:03.919]  I don't remember the exact... One of them... Hold on just a minute, let me think.
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:05.960]  My memory's been failing today.
[01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:11.162]  I want to say BBC.
[01:45:12.063 --> 01:45:16.805]  There's been like five of them in BBC, we found, and then a BBC radio report shut it to...
[01:45:18.352 --> 01:45:19.612]  I'll try to dig it up and get it to you, Jim.
[01:45:19.632 --> 01:45:25.877]  Yeah, a few years ago, Channel 4 in London did a full one hour thing on Bilderberg.
[01:45:26.397 --> 01:45:31.140]  It was, well, there were some mistakes which I can understand.
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:42.948]  They had their guy with me in Washington a week before the meeting, all week in Bilderberg countries, Portugal that year, and for a week in Washington afterwards with the microphone always under my chin.
[01:45:43.846 --> 01:45:44.607]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:45:59.929 --> 01:46:00.930]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:46:01.130 --> 01:46:06.653]  I was in the same four-part Secret Rules of the World piece.
[01:46:07.154 --> 01:46:08.575]  That thing's pure propaganda.
[01:46:08.975 --> 01:46:13.938]  The book he wrote, John Robinson, has me hiding from werewolves, okay?
[01:46:14.378 --> 01:46:16.540]  So, I know, folks, I didn't hide from werewolves.
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:20.142]  And literally, literally, I was on the phone and I said, man, the fog's like
[01:46:20.779 --> 01:46:21.499]  In fact, we're not.
[01:46:21.579 --> 01:46:26.922]  When they were working on what was to be the one-hour documentary on Bill Briggs, they never said they were also working on a book.
[01:46:26.982 --> 01:46:28.203]  That would not have changed the rules.
[01:46:50.851 --> 01:46:53.153]  And maybe he didn't know he was going to write a book at that point.
[01:46:53.274 --> 01:46:53.714]  No, no, no.
[01:46:53.754 --> 01:46:56.717]  He was already writing the book while he was doing the documentary.
[01:46:56.737 --> 01:47:00.481]  He was writing it at dinner on cocktail napkins in front of me.
[01:47:01.401 --> 01:47:06.486]  Oh, well, in that case, the gracious thing to do would be to say, I'm also doing a book.
[01:47:06.566 --> 01:47:08.328]  Because I'll say, that wouldn't change rules.
[01:47:08.348 --> 01:47:09.369]  We said everything was on the record.
[01:47:09.389 --> 01:47:11.131]  Yeah, that was brought out by Simon & Schuster.
[01:47:11.151 --> 01:47:12.152]  I'm not even going to mention the book.
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:14.541]  I'm not trying to be mean to the guy either.
[01:47:14.561 --> 01:47:15.682]  I just, you know, I'm tired.
[01:47:15.702 --> 01:47:23.769]  I mean, I kind of like him at a certain level, but a few of the things he's done, it's just, you know, he misrepresented me in that book.
[01:47:25.210 --> 01:47:27.492]  But, you know, c'est la vie, show his life, huh?
[01:47:28.072 --> 01:47:41.523]  When they were in, a couple of years ago, in, I don't even know how to pronounce it, in Bergen, Germany, I saw them on a late night talking, and he was talking about Philip Berg, and
[01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:56.921]  Asked him if it was a conspiracy and he said it certainly could be called a conspiracy because when you're trying to meet you don't want anybody to know that and doors are guarded and places are sealed off and you're trying to keep the meeting itself from being known.
[01:47:57.282 --> 01:48:00.184]  He said that has the ingredients of a conspiracy.
[01:48:00.945 --> 01:48:05.567]  So he's not been 100% with their lovable guys.
[01:48:06.167 --> 01:48:08.788]  He's not been as hard on them as I think he ought to be.
[01:48:09.228 --> 01:48:10.328]  Well, I think he's changed.
[01:48:10.388 --> 01:48:19.331]  I mean, I think when he first wrote that book and did all that seven years ago, yes, folks, he did it in 2000 and aired in 2001.
[01:48:20.031 --> 01:48:23.713]  He's changed now because the listeners, it wasn't popular what he did.
[01:48:24.813 --> 01:48:26.573]  And I've interviewed him since and talked to him.
[01:48:26.653 --> 01:48:28.094]  I was on Coast to Coast AM with him.
[01:48:28.935 --> 01:48:33.859]  And since then, he's totally changed his tune because he knows the tide has turned against him.
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:39.684]  Hey, did you hear about Bruce Willis coming out and saying he thinks the shadow government killed Kennedy and is still running things today?
[01:48:42.547 --> 01:48:43.407]  Yes, I heard about it.
[01:48:43.427 --> 01:48:44.888]  I don't know much more about it.
[01:48:45.869 --> 01:48:46.970]  I don't know much more about it.
[01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:50.173]  There's some discussion of his comments the other day.
[01:48:50.653 --> 01:48:51.294]  I listened to it.
[01:48:51.754 --> 01:48:53.736]  I had nothing to contribute because I just didn't know.
[01:48:55.405 --> 01:49:04.354]  I heard about it, but I was just involved in a conversation with several people and somebody brought it up.
[01:49:05.194 --> 01:49:15.457]  Well, it certainly is big news because, as you know, he's been kind of a poster boy for the fake conservatives, and his defection to the truth movement and to reality does not bode well for them.
[01:49:15.517 --> 01:49:17.157]  He's kind of like a canary in the coal mine.
[01:49:17.457 --> 01:49:26.180]  I mean, if we get Bruce Willis, which we now have, folks, I've talked to folks, three people behind the scenes, one of them publicly, Linkletter's gone public, that he is now with us.
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:30.681]  He has now left the dark side and has now joined us.
[01:49:31.001 --> 01:49:32.642]  This is good news, Jim.
[01:49:33.042 --> 01:49:33.202]  Good.
[01:49:34.156 --> 01:49:34.937]  We're making progress.
[01:49:35.337 --> 01:49:37.358]  Jim, we've got loaded phones for you.
[01:49:37.438 --> 01:49:47.303]  I want to twist your arm into five minutes in the next hour so we can have ten minutes of air time to just jam in these five calls, two minutes a call for five callers that are holding all we have time to get to.
[01:49:47.764 --> 01:49:51.666]  We'll be right back with the legendary Jim Tucker, author of the Bilderberg Diary.
[01:49:56.582 --> 01:50:02.027]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.387 --> 01:50:10.034]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.743 --> 01:50:17.785]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.186 --> 01:50:29.609]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.909 --> 01:50:33.411]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.871 --> 01:50:35.811]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.132 --> 01:50:39.993]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.248 --> 01:50:58.332]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:58.392 --> 01:51:05.697]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:05.857 --> 01:51:16.485]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:16.685 --> 01:51:21.248]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:21.508 --> 01:51:26.493]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[01:51:26.714 --> 01:51:29.657]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:29.877 --> 01:51:39.707]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:51:53.228 --> 01:51:54.948]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.168 --> 01:51:58.869]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.189 --> 01:52:01.410]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[01:52:08.291 --> 01:52:13.192]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.392 --> 01:52:22.334]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:53:00.665 --> 01:53:05.129]  We have a warrant for you to go into possession of illegal weapons!
[01:53:05.169 --> 01:53:07.410]  Please get down on the ground!
[01:53:21.617 --> 01:53:24.498]  I watch and learn and call them all suckers.
[01:53:25.278 --> 01:53:27.459]  You wanted me about Osama over there.
[01:53:27.479 --> 01:53:29.380]  Pitching me buying a scam.
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:31.841]  I said never.
[01:53:32.021 --> 01:53:32.821]  Great song.
[01:53:33.742 --> 01:53:35.362]  Remind me to roll that later in the next hour.
[01:53:35.382 --> 01:53:40.044]  Because I've been getting teased with it lately and not getting to it.
[01:53:40.324 --> 01:53:44.746]  Alright, let's go back to Jim Tucker and we're going to go to Richard, Rick, Dave, Brad, Steven.
[01:53:44.766 --> 01:53:47.427]  He's going to hold over to the next segment so we can take your calls.
[01:53:47.827 --> 01:53:50.328]  Richard in Texas, you're on the air with Jim Tucker.
[01:53:50.348 --> 01:53:50.648]  Go ahead.
[01:53:51.784 --> 01:54:06.800]  Guys, I just wanted to comment that it sure seems like it ought to be an extraordinary meeting this year with everything that's going on for these people to try to sort out the sinking Bush presidency, the Iraq War, world economy issues, and that kind of thing.
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:08.722]  It just ought to be extremely interesting.
[01:54:09.267 --> 01:54:20.611]  And I'm curious, do we know, or is there sort of a revolving position of who actually is the orchestrator of the agenda, locations, and that sort of thing in the Bilderberg Group?
[01:54:20.751 --> 01:54:21.912]  Thank you for your work.
[01:54:22.172 --> 01:54:25.853]  Yeah, we've got Etienne Davignon, the head honcho, right?
[01:54:27.114 --> 01:54:34.797]  Yes, but the one who will determine the agenda would be David Rockefeller and the Rothschilds of Europe.
[01:54:37.450 --> 01:54:39.671]  That'll be the representative Franco Barnaby, right?
[01:54:39.991 --> 01:54:40.211]  Yeah.
[01:54:40.811 --> 01:54:42.052]  I think that's his name.
[01:54:42.912 --> 01:54:43.972]  Franco Barnaby, yeah.
[01:54:44.012 --> 01:54:48.014]  For years, they had people by the name of Rothschilds.
[01:54:48.114 --> 01:54:51.075]  I first thought Evan Rothschild was a girl.
[01:54:51.115 --> 01:54:52.635]  It turned out he's an old boy dead now.
[01:54:53.436 --> 01:55:00.138]  But since then, for cover reasons, they've gotten a member of the Rothschilds family without the Rothschilds' last name.
[01:55:00.959 --> 01:55:01.641]  To attend meetings.
[01:55:01.761 --> 01:55:02.122]  That's right.
[01:55:02.162 --> 01:55:09.177]  Like, well, Baron Rothschild goes sometimes, and so does Lloyd Rothschild too, but they also have a lot of people that go that aren't on the list, correct?
[01:55:10.752 --> 01:55:11.372]  Yes, we have.
[01:55:11.852 --> 01:55:20.158]  Besides we've been able to get their official list, we've also been able to spot some people, identify them by eye, some of the guys with binoculars and so forth.
[01:55:20.198 --> 01:55:27.343]  By the way, Hillary, we heard was there for about six hours, and then we called her office and they said, how do you know that?
[01:55:27.383 --> 01:55:28.004]  How did you know that?
[01:55:28.024 --> 01:55:28.724]  And freaked out.
[01:55:28.984 --> 01:55:30.806]  Did you get any intel she was there last year?
[01:55:31.806 --> 01:55:36.149]  Not that she was there, but we did positively pin her down at the meeting and
[01:55:37.941 --> 01:55:45.267]  Georgia a few years ago, near Lakeland, about 40 miles from Atlanta, and she was positively identified as being there.
[01:55:45.287 --> 01:55:46.308]  She was First Lady then.
[01:55:46.328 --> 01:55:48.951]  Now that's a violation of the Logan Act.
[01:55:49.211 --> 01:55:53.975]  Of course, and I went back to call the White House when we got back to Washington, and her staff
[01:55:56.259 --> 01:55:58.460]  I asked them to officially confirm her attendance.
[01:55:59.021 --> 01:56:00.582]  They said, oh no, she didn't attend such a meeting.
[01:56:01.102 --> 01:56:05.184]  I said, I have positive knowledge that she did.
[01:56:05.725 --> 01:56:11.448]  I'm prepared to write in the story that she attended the meeting, but her staff was unaware of it, if that's what you prefer.
[01:56:11.468 --> 01:56:16.831]  They called back a few minutes later and said we confirmed that she was at the Bilderberg meeting at Lake Lanier.
[01:56:17.171 --> 01:56:17.772]  That's huge.
[01:56:18.552 --> 01:56:21.574]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Rick in Texas.
[01:56:21.754 --> 01:56:22.354]  Rick, go ahead.
[01:56:22.374 --> 01:56:25.176]  Have you actually talked to David Rockefeller?
[01:56:26.419 --> 01:56:26.960]  Several times.
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:28.621]  He doesn't like me very much.
[01:56:29.941 --> 01:56:36.005]  Has he ever asked him or been able to tell him thanks for ruining his own country?
[01:56:37.605 --> 01:56:39.166]  We've never had an extended conversation.
[01:56:39.186 --> 01:56:52.874]  It would be eyeball to eyeball and a quick question and him turning away, holding his big portfolio thing in both arms like a schoolgirl carrying her schoolbooks.
[01:56:54.047 --> 01:56:59.989]  Uh, he's never actually directly responded, just his eyeballs start to roll around, he turns away and his entourage surrounds him.
[01:57:00.069 --> 01:57:04.210]  And he's always got, uh, Mr. Ford, his bodyguard, right behind him.
[01:57:05.050 --> 01:57:07.231]  Uh, yes, he's always had heavy security.
[01:57:07.271 --> 01:57:09.932]  The old boy's kind of frail now, anyway, he's 90-some years old.
[01:57:11.152 --> 01:57:13.253]  All of his brothers have decided to die already.
[01:57:14.955 --> 01:57:16.396]  Of the original Rockefeller.
[01:57:16.656 --> 01:57:18.576]  Yeah, he'll be making the jump into hell soon.
[01:57:19.257 --> 01:57:20.877]  Anything else, Rick?
[01:57:21.297 --> 01:57:28.279]  I think he took out two of them personally in the late 70s to run George Herbert Walker Bush for the 80 election.
[01:57:28.679 --> 01:57:29.220]  You got it.
[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:31.660]  More calls from David Morad and Steven.
[01:57:33.301 --> 01:57:37.962]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.705 --> 01:57:50.365]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.026 --> 01:57:52.066]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.787 --> 01:57:53.908]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.568 --> 01:57:55.368]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.129 --> 01:57:56.989]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.009 --> 01:58:01.352]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.872 --> 01:58:07.816]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.936 --> 01:58:09.737]  Now into hour number three.
[01:58:10.117 --> 01:58:13.559]  Masses of news on what television does to children's brains.
[01:58:14.039 --> 01:58:15.820]  The dollar further sliding.
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:17.001]  I just can't stand it.
[01:58:17.831 --> 01:58:22.594]  Hi, I was just wondering if you could comment on the Pilgrim Society and its relationship with Bilderberg.
[01:58:42.046 --> 01:58:44.027]  I don't know anything about the Pilgrim Society.
[01:58:44.367 --> 01:58:45.587]  It's another elite group.
[01:58:45.647 --> 01:58:47.008]  I mean, it's all made up of the same people.
[01:58:47.028 --> 01:58:47.968]  They're all interlocking.
[01:58:48.548 --> 01:58:50.549]  But people can Google Pilgrim Society.
[01:58:50.609 --> 01:58:51.909]  It's extremely influential.
[01:58:51.929 --> 01:58:54.270]  Another British Royalist Society.
[01:58:54.290 --> 01:58:55.470]  Would you like to comment on that, Lester?
[01:58:56.391 --> 01:59:09.055]  Just one thing was the fact that it's not just the Brits, because basically, there's a Pilgrim Society of the United States, which is, you know, all the Rockefellers and that kind of thing.
[01:59:11.465 --> 01:59:11.885]  Interesting.
[01:59:11.905 --> 01:59:12.386]  Anything else?
[01:59:13.106 --> 01:59:13.767]  No, that was it.
[01:59:14.067 --> 01:59:14.908]  Thank you, sir.
[01:59:15.368 --> 01:59:17.850]  I was just looking into the Portable Society two days ago.
[01:59:18.590 --> 01:59:19.631]  Let's talk to Brad.
[01:59:20.372 --> 01:59:22.733]  Brad, where are you calling us from?
[01:59:22.753 --> 01:59:24.575]  Hello?
[01:59:25.504 --> 01:59:27.886]  Yes, Brad, I'm told you're calling us from Russia.
[01:59:28.166 --> 01:59:32.428]  My name isn't Brad, it's Vlad, V-L-A-D, as Vladimir.
[01:59:32.628 --> 01:59:42.695]  Okay, well, I'm sorry, the person answering the phone told me your name was Brad, because your phone doesn't have a good connection, so I could see how it would sound like, Vlad would sound like Brad.
[01:59:43.075 --> 01:59:44.256]  But, Vladimir, go ahead.
[01:59:44.276 --> 01:59:50.480]  Alright, yeah, I'm calling from Russia, and basically, I'm sorry, man, I haven't got any information, or...
[01:59:52.051 --> 01:59:57.827]  The solution is for you to pound them with, but I do have a couple of short questions which are a bit off topic.
[01:59:57.887 --> 01:59:59.291]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:59:59.331 --> 01:59:59.952]  Ask your questions.
[02:00:00.820 --> 02:00:02.381]  Alright, yeah, my first question is this.
[02:00:03.081 --> 02:00:10.544]  I was listening to a couple of your shows, like yesterday, the day before yesterday, about the total population reduction.
[02:00:10.564 --> 02:00:13.386]  You know, I tell you what, we're just taking calls for Jim.
[02:00:13.426 --> 02:00:14.586]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:00:14.846 --> 02:00:16.107]  We're going to break in two minutes.
[02:00:16.167 --> 02:00:17.528]  I'm going to come to you first.
[02:00:18.008 --> 02:00:20.229]  So Vladimir, please don't hang up.
[02:00:20.269 --> 02:00:22.970]  We're going to come back to you and I'll address you by yourself.
[02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:25.151]  Steve in Arizona, last call for Jim Tucker.
[02:00:25.171 --> 02:00:25.591]  Go ahead.
[02:00:26.612 --> 02:00:29.453]  Yes, it's an honor to speak with you, Alex and Jim.
[02:00:31.388 --> 02:00:48.880]  My question, well really my analysis on this is that it seems that elites throughout history have hidden in the shadows of history, which is why so many people have such a big problem in believing in their existence.
[02:00:50.461 --> 02:00:59.648]  And of course, looking back, throughout history with the Roman Empire, Egypt, the Mayans, it's obvious
[02:01:00.967 --> 02:01:10.099]  At that distance, but my question was, um, how do we expose these people?
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:12.622]  Well, that's what Jim's doing right now.
[02:01:12.642 --> 02:01:16.648]  I mean, they've gone from the average American not thinking there's any elite to everybody knowing it.
[02:01:17.168 --> 02:01:18.230]  Jim, final comments?
[02:01:19.452 --> 02:01:21.593]  Oh yes, the Power Elites have.
[02:01:21.614 --> 02:01:35.422]  We've known four centuries ago, the first Rothschild turned the fortune on by some manipulating of the, what I read that biography some years ago, there's some secret manipulation of the stock market in Britain.
[02:01:37.704 --> 02:01:45.249]  Yes, they met with, about 1913, the Power Elite met to introduce the
[02:01:46.084 --> 02:01:53.148]  Income tax in the United States, they said that we'll stay here until there's a new money system, so the Federal Reserve is generated.
[02:01:53.168 --> 02:01:59.211]  No, it goes back far before their first meeting under the word Bilderberg, which is 1954.
[02:02:00.112 --> 02:02:15.340]  So, it was in 1954 they decided we have to be systematic, we'll have to meet once a year, they have various little committees that get together during the off-season, but their annual meeting is where they pull it all together for their programs for the following year.
[02:02:17.782 --> 02:02:18.783]  Jim, we're out of time.
[02:02:18.863 --> 02:02:19.724]  Caller, we're out of time.
[02:02:19.764 --> 02:02:20.545]  Thank you, Stephen.
[02:02:21.045 --> 02:02:26.530]  Jim, I'm going to have my producer call you to get your itinerary or to get the contact point for you to give us that itinerary.
[02:02:26.910 --> 02:02:32.555]  And we'll be honored to have you on from Bilderberg in the capital of Turkey.
[02:02:32.915 --> 02:02:36.578]  And that's coming up, what, the end of May into early June, sir?
[02:02:36.719 --> 02:02:36.979]  Yes.
[02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:40.482]  And have her call me right away so I can go to lunch.
[02:02:40.922 --> 02:02:41.283]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:41.323 --> 02:02:42.143]  She'll call you right now.
[02:02:42.223 --> 02:02:42.764]  God bless you.
[02:02:48.547 --> 02:02:53.997]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.358 --> 02:03:01.971]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.702 --> 02:03:09.764]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.144 --> 02:03:21.567]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.867 --> 02:03:25.468]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.828 --> 02:03:27.769]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.109 --> 02:03:31.950]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:47.153 --> 02:04:51.274]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:04:51.494 --> 02:04:53.255]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:04:53.535 --> 02:04:59.817]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:05:00.097 --> 02:05:06.219]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:05:06.479 --> 02:05:08.200]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:05:08.220 --> 02:05:09.021]  We're good to go.
[02:05:31.079 --> 02:05:32.540]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:10.692 --> 02:06:11.312]  Welcome back.
[02:06:11.372 --> 02:06:12.773]  Let's talk to Vlad.
[02:06:13.493 --> 02:06:15.193]  Vladimir in Russia.
[02:06:16.194 --> 02:06:20.395]  And I apologize, I forgot we had a foreign caller on his own dime earlier and didn't go to him first.
[02:06:21.015 --> 02:06:22.476]  But it didn't matter because it was off topic.
[02:06:22.496 --> 02:06:24.696]  We are going to you first now, Vlad.
[02:06:25.677 --> 02:06:27.137]  So, go ahead and ask your question again.
[02:06:27.157 --> 02:06:31.759]  Yeah, my question is about the world population reduction.
[02:06:32.399 --> 02:06:32.619]  Yes.
[02:06:32.639 --> 02:06:37.841]  And how does Russia fit into those countries that... Well, look at your average age of death now.
[02:06:37.861 --> 02:06:38.121]  What is it, 53?
[02:06:39.834 --> 02:06:45.602]  I'm just saying that the Russian government and Putin have been pursuing the increase of the population.
[02:06:55.034 --> 02:07:04.745]  They've been trying to increase the population, they've been giving like discounts kind of things to families that have... Well that's right, I mean you've got multiple policies.
[02:07:04.845 --> 02:07:10.132]  France is trying to get some babies born, Russia is trying as well, and those are good policies.
[02:07:10.672 --> 02:07:12.353]  Frankly, I think those are excellent policies.
[02:07:13.354 --> 02:07:21.180]  And that shows that Russia... Do you reckon, is Russia one of those countries that are being controlled by one of the evil people?
[02:07:21.821 --> 02:07:22.901]  Well, I mean, let's be clear.
[02:07:22.921 --> 02:07:24.683]  The globalists don't have complete control.
[02:07:24.703 --> 02:07:28.105]  I mean, there's a lot of policies our government has that they don't like.
[02:07:28.386 --> 02:07:30.127]  Like not having completely open borders.
[02:07:30.427 --> 02:07:32.409]  We just basically have half open borders.
[02:07:33.029 --> 02:07:39.134]  So, they haven't rested... See, the globalists are trying to destroy what Russia had, what America had.
[02:07:39.754 --> 02:07:45.300]  And they've tried everything they can, but the will to survive just continues to beat in our hearts.
[02:07:46.462 --> 02:07:54.831]  And so, no, they're not in complete control of Russia, and it looks like they've been losing even more control, which is causing them to pull their hair out in fits of anger.
[02:07:55.732 --> 02:07:56.753]  Yeah, man.
[02:07:57.353 --> 02:07:59.294]  Also, if... I'll tell you what I don't like.
[02:07:59.314 --> 02:08:13.039]  I was just reading BBC last night, sir, about how hundreds of thousands of Russian women are tricked or actually kidnapped and flown to Saudi Arabia and Israel and then sold on actual auction blocks.
[02:08:13.179 --> 02:08:16.340]  BBC admits it, but it's not a major news story.
[02:08:17.021 --> 02:08:20.022]  Are the Russian people mad about the mafia kidnapping your women?
[02:08:22.443 --> 02:08:25.565]  No, they're not.
[02:08:25.585 --> 02:08:35.151]  You need to educate your women that when somebody goes, hey you're going to have a fabulous job in Tel Aviv, or you're going to have a fabulous job in Saudi Arabia, get on my private jet.
[02:08:35.592 --> 02:08:42.656]  I mean literally the women show up and they chain them down and they make them have upwards of 18 partners a day.
[02:08:42.716 --> 02:08:46.179]  They make them work 16 hours a day, 45 minutes per partner.
[02:08:46.699 --> 02:08:47.780]  Shadow masochism.
[02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:49.462]  If they get pregnant, they abort them.
[02:08:49.922 --> 02:08:51.924]  Or sometimes when they try to escape, they kill them.
[02:08:52.625 --> 02:08:56.688]  And that's our gallant little ally, Israel, is one of the head people doing that, and I've had enough of it.
[02:08:56.708 --> 02:08:59.371]  Alright, yeah.
[02:08:59.811 --> 02:09:01.593]  Another question I can ask you, man, please.
[02:09:01.973 --> 02:09:02.213]  Sure.
[02:09:02.233 --> 02:09:11.582]  Alright, I've been listening to your show for about like three months, and it was enough for me to, you know, to come to a conclusion here.
[02:09:12.798 --> 02:09:19.603]  I always wanted to ask you about your personal belief towards UFOs, you know, the circle phenomenon.
[02:09:20.883 --> 02:09:22.264]  My view towards my foes?
[02:09:23.165 --> 02:09:24.646]  UFOs, UFOs.
[02:09:25.426 --> 02:09:26.367]  Oh, UFOs.
[02:09:27.488 --> 02:09:28.188]  Here's the deal.
[02:09:28.808 --> 02:09:35.753]  I have, I don't know, scores of mainstream news articles where they're admitting they're building FEMA camps for the American people.
[02:09:36.346 --> 02:09:38.007]  Concentration camps, internment camps.
[02:09:38.627 --> 02:09:40.007]  I can't get the general public to believe it.
[02:09:40.427 --> 02:09:43.828]  We have hundreds of major studies that mercury causes massive brain damage.
[02:09:43.848 --> 02:09:45.249]  They've increased the level of mercury.
[02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:47.849]  I'm just barely able to reach the general public.
[02:09:48.429 --> 02:09:53.771]  I can't even get the general public to admit there's a European Union, sir, as the dollar plunges and America dies.
[02:09:54.931 --> 02:10:03.694]  So, I just study all those things I can prove with a general public that is so trained to be cowardly, they lie to themselves and say it doesn't exist.
[02:10:07.167 --> 02:10:26.805]  So, look, Hubble in its first year in orbit, after it had a lens adjustment repair, chronicled over 200 plus billion separate galaxies with hundreds of billions of stars per galaxy with thousands of billions of planets orbiting in each galaxy.
[02:10:30.258 --> 02:10:37.305]  And I have no doubt that the universe is not teeming with life forms, interdimensional things we can't even imagine.
[02:10:37.965 --> 02:10:43.290]  Life, more top scientists are saying, is probably all around us on the planet we haven't even been able to recognize.
[02:10:44.150 --> 02:10:49.115]  The mathematics has showed dimensional vortex and dimensions.
[02:10:49.215 --> 02:10:53.559]  Actually, a top scientist in the 50s said that when we had an orbiter,
[02:10:54.299 --> 02:10:58.480]  Or a probe fly over Saturn that it was a large enough gas giant.
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:05.661]  The mathematical expressions would show an interdimensional pole that would express as a hexagon on the poles.
[02:11:06.221 --> 02:11:09.042]  Now probes have shown perfect hexagon on the pole.
[02:11:09.322 --> 02:11:11.022]  That is a dimensional expression.
[02:11:12.863 --> 02:11:16.203]  It gets so complex in quantum mechanics it's hard to even grasp, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:16.704 --> 02:11:18.964]  You can just lay there and think about it for hours.
[02:11:19.024 --> 02:11:23.585]  It's so incredible and literally seeing the handiwork of God in the mathematics.
[02:11:25.106 --> 02:11:31.993]  There's no doubt there's untold things and just unimagined incredible things in the universe.
[02:11:32.394 --> 02:11:37.419]  If we can just develop and get past our bestial behavior, God has so many things planned for us.
[02:11:37.759 --> 02:11:47.269]  I just want to work towards that so my offspring and my great-great-grandchildren can take part in exploration, deep space exploration, colonization.
[02:11:48.354 --> 02:11:54.598]  And, you know, maybe it'll just be a mention in a book and my progeny will look back and be proud of me a little bit.
[02:11:55.478 --> 02:11:57.560]  So, like, I'm proud of my forebears.
[02:12:00.541 --> 02:12:02.583]  Instead, none of it's probably going to happen.
[02:12:05.044 --> 02:12:08.606]  Instead, they're going to engineer us and enslave us and do horrible, wicked things.
[02:12:09.026 --> 02:12:10.007]  Probably kill the earth.
[02:12:10.147 --> 02:12:16.691]  Just a bunch of degenerate scum and wearing jeweled crowns stumbling around at stupid horse races.
[02:12:17.535 --> 02:12:19.639]  I mean, it's just disgusting, my friend.
[02:12:19.699 --> 02:12:20.701]  I appreciate your call.
[02:12:21.603 --> 02:12:24.608]  So you ask what I think about UFOs, I don't know.
[02:12:24.628 --> 02:12:27.534]  I am forced to deal with the crap.
[02:12:28.687 --> 02:12:53.214]  going on on this planet today and I have to watch the activities of this disgusting scum as they crawl all over us and have their way with us and stupid police who I don't even hate but I just feel so sorry for them and I and I and I detest the abuse they mete out to us on their petty power trips not knowing who they're working for not being able to have the big picture and I just
[02:12:56.863 --> 02:12:59.544]  You know, it's just so disgusting.
[02:13:00.905 --> 02:13:06.408]  And again, the only reason I want them to remember their forebearers is so that they will think about the future that's coming for them.
[02:13:06.768 --> 02:13:09.310]  Because that's how you truly live forever, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:09.330 --> 02:13:10.430]  That's the guarantee.
[02:13:11.070 --> 02:13:13.332]  You live through the species, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:13.912 --> 02:13:17.434]  I don't believe in reincarnation, but I do believe in the ancestral memory.
[02:13:17.734 --> 02:13:19.255]  And I do believe we live on.
[02:13:20.195 --> 02:13:24.838]  All of my forebearers that came before me, those great men and women, and all the struggles, everything, I
[02:13:26.520 --> 02:13:31.642]  I'm alive, and they live on through me, and they live on through my children, and my children are going to live on through their children.
[02:13:32.442 --> 02:13:37.804]  And I mean, we're going to get to the point where by the time my children are ready to have children, there are going to be taxes on having children.
[02:13:38.025 --> 02:13:44.147]  And by the time they try to have kids, it's all going to be genetically marked and traced and authorized by eugenics bureaus under new names.
[02:13:44.387 --> 02:13:45.427]  It's already all happening.
[02:13:45.668 --> 02:13:50.649]  And I am not going to sit here and watch this happen, and I'm not going to go along with it!
[02:13:50.910 --> 02:13:51.650]  What about you?
[02:13:54.446 --> 02:14:00.291]  The New World Order is anti-beauty, anti-strength, anti-honor, anti-everything that's good and decent.
[02:14:00.612 --> 02:14:09.179]  They are inbred scum that never worked a day in their life, that go around and scheme, and have us trained to not look them in the eyes and bow down to them.
[02:14:09.339 --> 02:14:10.901]  Well, I'll never bow down to them.
[02:14:10.921 --> 02:14:13.803]  I bow down to one thing, and that's God Almighty.
[02:14:14.784 --> 02:14:16.406]  And I'll never bow down to them.
[02:14:17.487 --> 02:14:17.707]  Ever!
[02:14:21.587 --> 02:14:22.768]  No, I'm out of control today.
[02:14:22.808 --> 02:14:23.208]  I know that.
[02:14:23.448 --> 02:14:26.250]  I am just absolutely angry about this Queen of England garbage.
[02:14:29.152 --> 02:14:31.534]  Let's talk to Dave in North Carolina.
[02:14:31.574 --> 02:14:32.275]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:14:33.095 --> 02:14:34.296]  Northern California, brother.
[02:14:34.336 --> 02:14:35.337]  Good to talk to you again.
[02:14:35.597 --> 02:14:36.918]  I can't get any of the states right.
[02:14:37.118 --> 02:14:38.439]  Let's just say you're on Pluto.
[02:14:38.459 --> 02:14:38.839]  Go ahead.
[02:14:38.879 --> 02:14:40.981]  If I bow to the Queen, it'll be backwards.
[02:14:43.403 --> 02:14:44.804]  I got one question for you, partner.
[02:14:45.904 --> 02:14:48.886]  This kind of cuts across Bilderberg, the global elite, and 9-11.
[02:14:50.482 --> 02:14:56.146]  Can you briefly just fill me in on what is the role of Zionism in all this stuff?
[02:14:56.286 --> 02:14:57.227]  It's so confusing.
[02:14:57.307 --> 02:15:01.010]  I said I'd do that today, and I'm going to do that at the bottom of the hour.
[02:15:01.030 --> 02:15:05.232]  In fact, I reminded myself, and I'm still planning to do it, and I will get into it.
[02:15:05.413 --> 02:15:07.574]  But basically, all governments are evil.
[02:15:08.915 --> 02:15:13.638]  The powers and principalities, as the Bible says, evil gets in power.
[02:15:13.678 --> 02:15:15.800]  When freedom gets in power, it's very rare.
[02:15:16.761 --> 02:15:18.662]  When righteousness is in power, it's very rare.
[02:15:19.611 --> 02:15:21.092]  Israel is completely, totally wicked.
[02:15:21.673 --> 02:15:22.754]  So is Saudi Arabia.
[02:15:23.474 --> 02:15:25.055]  So is England.
[02:15:25.116 --> 02:15:33.022]  Those that want to tell you it's this group or that group, they want to deceive you into thinking that it's all coming out of one group, instead of looking at the evil that's in all of us and changing it.
[02:15:34.963 --> 02:15:40.548]  Certainly, there's great wickedness, great power wielded out of Israel and through those that created Israel.
[02:15:41.068 --> 02:15:51.832]  And there's no doubt that Israel was involved in the 9-11 operation, but of course the US, England, many others were all involved because it's one big leviathan.
[02:15:51.872 --> 02:15:53.693]  It's one Hydra.
[02:15:54.653 --> 02:15:59.215]  And what other people do is they point at one head and then have debates and say, no, there's no more heads.
[02:15:59.515 --> 02:16:00.816]  And there's clearly a lot of heads.
[02:16:01.176 --> 02:16:06.538]  And so really it's a distraction that they go, I mean, literally it's a religion, just a parrot.
[02:16:07.148 --> 02:16:14.501]  Parrot stuff about Israel all day, but those people only attack everyone and they say no one's good with them, and it's all really exclusive and
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:25.766]  But then, with history, we've tracked back that a lot of times it's actually governments or Zionists actually funding them, because, see, that's not a legitimate attack on Zionism and the New World Order.
[02:16:26.047 --> 02:16:31.450]  If you attack it for the wrongs it's done, and for the bad things it's done, then it falls.
[02:16:32.031 --> 02:16:34.792]  And if you attack it as organized crime, then the public can join you.
[02:16:35.173 --> 02:16:42.917]  But if you go in and attack it with all of the nomenclature... I mean, sir, it is... Major Jewish professors have written books now.
[02:16:43.238 --> 02:16:44.999]  Those are five different ones in the last couple of years.
[02:16:45.699 --> 02:16:51.640]  Where they went and found the, and we already knew this, but now it's books have been written about it, but by PhDs, and they're Jewish, that's even better.
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:17:08.843]  So then they can't, though they try to claim anti-Semitic, and they physically attack them or burn down their synagogues, other Jews do, that they actually funded Hitler, believed in Hitler, wanted Hitler to be mean to the Jews, to force them out, and they say persecution is our strength.
[02:17:09.403 --> 02:17:12.784]  So basically it's like some, you know, Mexican leader in the barrio.
[02:17:13.004 --> 02:17:14.624]  They don't want their people to get freedom.
[02:17:15.490 --> 02:17:17.030]  They don't want their people to get liberty.
[02:17:17.950 --> 02:17:19.931]  They don't want them to ever move up.
[02:17:19.971 --> 02:17:24.932]  They want to keep them on the barrio, keep them all subdivided so they can control them.
[02:17:25.912 --> 02:17:34.853]  And it's the same thing with black leaders, same thing with Jewish leaders, and then the quote WASP leaders, you know, you gotta stick with the WASP because we're all together while they're waging war against everybody.
[02:17:35.674 --> 02:17:39.194]  So it's more just tribalism and you've just got tribal managers doing that.
[02:17:40.094 --> 02:17:41.755]  And so that's the bottom line.
[02:17:41.915 --> 02:17:43.075]  But I'll get more into it later.
[02:17:43.415 --> 02:17:44.055]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:45.922 --> 02:17:46.903]  How are you feeling today?
[02:17:47.123 --> 02:17:47.583]  Why ask?
[02:17:47.623 --> 02:17:53.708]  Because if you have health challenges, then reading our free e-booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[02:17:53.949 --> 02:17:58.352]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call Mangosteen.

[02:18:37.722 --> 02:18:38.402]  Call 800-658-0597.
[02:18:38.422 --> 02:18:44.185]  Again, that's 800-658-0597.
[02:18:46.326 --> 02:18:50.168]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:18:50.208 --> 02:18:51.449]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:18:51.609 --> 02:18:55.191]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:18:55.491 --> 02:18:57.992]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[02:18:58.392 --> 02:19:00.153]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:19:00.473 --> 02:19:02.775]  They've both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:19:03.815 --> 02:19:14.261]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:19:14.301 --> 02:19:18.244]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:19:18.324 --> 02:19:21.406]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[02:21:38.102 --> 02:21:41.144]  Go to 1-2-3 Nodet.com.
[02:21:41.304 --> 02:21:42.345]  Live debt free now.
[02:21:42.605 --> 02:21:44.186]  You lose nothing but the debt.
[02:21:58.459 --> 02:22:00.580]  Dollar slides as U.S.
[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:02.061]  outlook sours.
[02:22:04.402 --> 02:22:06.183]  Bet you tell a yuppie at an airport about it.
[02:22:06.663 --> 02:22:07.444]  They just snicker.
[02:22:07.564 --> 02:22:08.284]  They're trained to do it.
[02:22:09.845 --> 02:22:10.385]  Alright.
[02:22:11.526 --> 02:22:15.588]  The dollar slipped on Monday ahead of three central bank meetings.
[02:22:16.388 --> 02:22:18.749]  You tell the general public about a central bank, they go, what's that?
[02:22:18.789 --> 02:22:19.970]  There's no such thing as elites.
[02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:23.091]  They may underscore market expectations for U.S.
[02:22:23.151 --> 02:22:28.054]  interest rates to fall this year as rates in other major economies climb higher.
[02:22:29.136 --> 02:22:34.741]  Well, the Federal Reserve is seen holding rates at 5.25% after its meeting on Wednesday.
[02:22:34.821 --> 02:22:37.943]  Analysts say officials may concede signs of slower U.S.
[02:22:37.983 --> 02:22:46.450]  growth after recent data revealed anemic job growth in April, yeah, 1.5, caused the dollar to drift lower.
[02:22:47.438 --> 02:22:57.527]  The Bank of England, meanwhile, is seeing lifting rates to 5.5% on Thursday, a move that would put British interest rates above those in the United States for the first time since January 2006.
[02:22:58.047 --> 02:23:00.769]  And that's just a way to shove the dollar down further.
[02:23:02.511 --> 02:23:07.275]  And for yuppies out there that might want to know 101 of this, it's not very hard.
[02:23:07.295 --> 02:23:08.296]  It's very elementary.
[02:23:08.356 --> 02:23:09.296]  I'm not even that smart.
[02:23:09.697 --> 02:23:11.818]  That's what freaks me out about you guys, that you don't care.
[02:23:11.838 --> 02:23:13.480]  Let me tell you what that means.
[02:23:14.554 --> 02:23:25.117]  If the dollar has already been massively devalued, and the interest rates are relatively low, there's no foreign investment buying the different securities that are issued.
[02:23:25.297 --> 02:23:29.339]  Federal securities, different types of bonds and T-bills that are issued.
[02:23:30.639 --> 02:23:39.722]  And then the pound, the strongest, because it's the center of the empire, currency in the world, it's well over double the dollar right now, with the euro a close second.
[02:23:41.605 --> 02:23:48.189]  If they have a higher interest rate on top of it, and a strong currency, where do you think investment from the world is going to go?
[02:23:48.650 --> 02:23:50.751]  By mainly states, mainly governments.
[02:23:51.551 --> 02:23:56.034]  It's going to accelerate into Europe and into the British sterling, the pound.
[02:23:57.695 --> 02:24:03.159]  That's our loyal, gallant little ally, England, oh yes!
[02:24:03.979 --> 02:24:09.723]  When the Queen's not publicly staring down the President as he grovels and stutters to her worshipfully,
[02:24:11.251 --> 02:24:19.973]  When he's not busy kneeling to his cousin, then they're busy stabbing the dollar, hatefully.
[02:24:21.314 --> 02:24:22.354]  With pleasure, of course.
[02:24:23.414 --> 02:24:28.755]  The European Central Bank is expected to hold its rate steady at 3.75% on Thursday, but signals a hike in June.
[02:24:29.436 --> 02:24:31.276]  And the dollar is already in complete free fall.
[02:24:31.336 --> 02:24:35.837]  It dropped six cents, what, two weeks ago in one week.
[02:24:35.877 --> 02:24:37.077]  That was ultra-massive.
[02:24:37.218 --> 02:24:38.438]  I mean, six cents in a week.
[02:24:39.657 --> 02:24:48.664]  It's been going down like six cents a year the last six, seven years, which was still very continual, precipitous dive downward.
[02:24:49.185 --> 02:24:52.027]  Now six cents in a week, and now a couple more cents in the last two weeks.
[02:24:52.447 --> 02:24:54.289]  I mean, this is just disastrous.
[02:24:55.109 --> 02:25:07.459]  In the scale of economic time, this is a blink of the eye, a fraction of a blink, and it's just... I don't know, just go watch American Shoppers on Discovery Channel and feel powerful, and go get another tat.
[02:25:08.470 --> 02:25:09.430]  And that'll make it all right.
[02:25:09.450 --> 02:25:10.691]  Your girlfriend will think you're powerful.
[02:25:10.971 --> 02:25:15.513]  I mean, don't actually know about finances and tell the government to stop and let them know you know they're aware of it.
[02:25:15.673 --> 02:25:17.453]  Then we might actually be able to save the dollar.
[02:25:18.234 --> 02:25:20.275]  No, let's just act tough.
[02:25:20.455 --> 02:25:21.275]  That's more important.
[02:25:21.335 --> 02:25:23.856]  And I'm not knocking you if you've got tats, but you know what I mean.
[02:25:23.876 --> 02:25:29.098]  It's like a new diploma or something, you know, and you want to show me that you're manly and show everybody.
[02:25:29.618 --> 02:25:31.379]  And I'd like to be manly and defend the Republic.
[02:25:31.859 --> 02:25:37.261]  And hate the Queen and learn to hate the scum that tries to train you to be like a little dog serving them.
[02:25:39.187 --> 02:25:43.189]  But the greenback lost ground against all major currencies on Monday.
[02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:48.932]  Through a public holiday in Britain, thinned out trading and kept losses modest.
[02:25:49.472 --> 02:25:56.156]  The euro was trading at 1.3604, up 0.1 from late Friday, and near a lifetime high.
[02:25:56.336 --> 02:25:58.777]  It's not near a lifetime, it is an all-time high of 1.3680.
[02:25:58.877 --> 02:26:01.738]  And the pound is well above double now.
[02:26:06.096 --> 02:26:07.977]  And interesting information there.
[02:26:09.657 --> 02:26:11.438]  But again, why do I care about that?
[02:26:11.478 --> 02:26:16.640]  I heard there's a Joe Montana might be calling NFL football games or something.
[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:19.161]  That's what's really important for my children's future.
[02:26:19.641 --> 02:26:24.423]  That's what men do because the New World Order media told me men don't actually go out and fight.
[02:26:24.863 --> 02:26:27.464]  Men go to simulated battles and act tough.
[02:26:28.985 --> 02:26:29.305]  See?
[02:26:29.825 --> 02:26:30.865]  It's a prosthesis.
[02:26:30.945 --> 02:26:32.006]  It's an artificial.
[02:26:32.606 --> 02:26:33.486]  Artificiality.
[02:26:33.546 --> 02:26:34.987]  It's form above substance.
[02:26:36.326 --> 02:26:47.851]  I won't take all these aggressive feelings I have and put it into business for my family or put it into standing up or getting involved with the legislature or fighting gun control or farmers and ranchers having their land stolen.
[02:26:48.211 --> 02:26:51.733]  I won't even know my neighbors because that's weird to talk to people.
[02:26:52.633 --> 02:26:58.175]  See, because I'm so manly, I'm afraid to talk to people or be involved or stand in front of a crowd of people.
[02:26:58.696 --> 02:27:03.758]  I'll just take the facsimile of manhood that I was told, sports and tattoos and Harleys
[02:27:04.651 --> 02:27:15.996]  and uh... and and and and drunkenness and I'll just do that and I'll have no future and be completely unhappy because I'm not really being a man and my heart and soul knows it, but that's okay.
[02:27:19.778 --> 02:27:22.139]  Alright, I'm being a little sarcastic today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:22.179 --> 02:27:22.679]  It's simple.
[02:27:23.399 --> 02:27:25.900]  If we expose the New World Order, they can't get away with this stuff.
[02:27:26.241 --> 02:27:27.301]  By the way, we've had some victories.
[02:27:27.321 --> 02:27:29.822]  They would have already staged more terror attacks if we hadn't done all this.
[02:27:30.282 --> 02:27:33.924]  So good job to everybody out there that is awake and taking action and all the real men out there.
[02:27:35.626 --> 02:27:38.632]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.553 --> 02:27:42.238]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.403 --> 02:27:57.405]  JLS Research, the makers of all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[02:27:57.626 --> 02:28:04.107]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[02:28:04.287 --> 02:28:11.929]  By using organics and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[02:28:12.169 --> 02:28:12.869]  As it responds,
[02:28:13.149 --> 02:28:15.171]  Body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[02:28:15.451 --> 02:28:17.293]  First Responder is the first of its kind.
[02:28:17.373 --> 02:28:18.954]  Comprised of only four organics.
[02:28:19.254 --> 02:28:22.537]  Grape seed skim, grape seed, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[02:28:22.918 --> 02:28:27.382]  It's so effective you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[02:28:27.702 --> 02:28:30.224]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[02:28:30.504 --> 02:28:33.987]  Go online and order First Responder at No-BO.com.
[02:28:34.188 --> 02:28:37.571]  Visit No-BO.com or call Jailless Research at 850-723-8599.
[02:28:40.453 --> 02:28:40.634]  That's 850-723-8599.
[02:28:45.396 --> 02:28:49.979]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:28:50.379 --> 02:28:53.301]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:28:53.641 --> 02:28:56.203]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:28:56.563 --> 02:29:01.386]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:29:01.766 --> 02:29:07.130]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:29:07.430 --> 02:29:10.392]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[02:29:10.572 --> 02:29:11.152]  We're good to go.
[02:29:33.977 --> 02:29:39.445]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your free books and a free DVD call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:29:39.465 --> 02:29:39.905]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:29:46.042 --> 02:29:47.203]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[02:29:47.223 --> 02:29:49.384]  I'm the Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:29:49.725 --> 02:29:52.727]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:29:52.767 --> 02:29:53.447]  is a real thing.
[02:29:53.527 --> 02:30:00.412]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[02:30:00.532 --> 02:30:05.816]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[02:30:05.976 --> 02:30:06.736]  We're good to go!
[02:30:32.805 --> 02:30:34.166]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I
[02:30:55.131 --> 02:31:01.496]  We had some calls from England.
[02:31:01.516 --> 02:31:08.983]  I didn't get to them, they hung up.
[02:31:09.323 --> 02:31:16.409]  I wonder if they were calling in because I was
[02:31:23.650 --> 02:31:25.851]  Violating her royalship!
[02:31:27.071 --> 02:31:29.312]  Now, most folks in England hate her more than over here.
[02:31:30.333 --> 02:31:34.374]  It's just so disgusting to see all the worshipping and the toadying after.
[02:31:34.394 --> 02:31:36.375]  I know we got a lot of phone lines.
[02:31:36.395 --> 02:31:38.516]  I'm supposed to get into Israel on the 9-11 connection.
[02:31:38.536 --> 02:31:39.576]  I keep saying I'll do that.
[02:31:40.096 --> 02:31:40.717]  Bogged up yesterday.
[02:31:40.737 --> 02:31:41.537]  Just ran out of time.
[02:31:42.257 --> 02:31:43.798]  And I haven't had him on in about two weeks.
[02:31:43.818 --> 02:31:44.698]  We're always honored.
[02:31:46.419 --> 02:31:49.880]  And he's Adam Locke, who I've known for years.
[02:31:50.563 --> 02:31:50.783]  I think so.
[02:32:11.861 --> 02:32:13.222]  You know, the rock climbing places.
[02:32:13.763 --> 02:32:18.927]  We got one in our house in the bathroom because the kids don't want to go to the kitchen at night to get water.
[02:32:19.327 --> 02:32:20.468]  You know, I like to drink out of the sink.
[02:32:20.488 --> 02:32:23.290]  Well, we got one in the bathroom, in the children's bathroom.
[02:32:24.291 --> 02:32:25.132]  They're on the stand.
[02:32:25.332 --> 02:32:26.093]  They're on the counter.
[02:32:26.813 --> 02:32:29.375]  And we use one here in the office, and I give them as gifts.
[02:32:29.515 --> 02:32:32.578]  I really believe in these, and I have been using them since 1998.
[02:32:34.941 --> 02:32:39.524]  And I still have a unit I bought in 1998, and you just clean the filters off of it.
[02:32:39.544 --> 02:32:41.466]  I still haven't run 10,000 gallons through it.
[02:32:41.506 --> 02:32:42.947]  I've probably given more than 10 of them.
[02:32:43.387 --> 02:32:45.649]  I know it's more than 10 of them over the years as gifts to family.
[02:32:46.329 --> 02:32:54.095]  My sister, who's 15 years younger than me, a couple years ago went on her senior high school trip for summer to New Guinea, I think.
[02:32:54.876 --> 02:33:00.460]  And everybody in the class got sick, but her partner, because they go in partners, and they live for like a month in the jungle.
[02:33:01.329 --> 02:33:03.309]  And everybody got sick with their big water filters.
[02:33:03.329 --> 02:33:05.330]  When she had sports burpees, they didn't get sick.
[02:33:06.450 --> 02:33:08.871]  And so, I mean, that's a testament right there.
[02:33:08.891 --> 02:33:11.331]  And joining us is Adam.
[02:33:11.651 --> 02:33:12.631]  Adam, thanks for coming on.
[02:33:13.132 --> 02:33:14.232]  Alex, always a pleasure.
[02:33:14.872 --> 02:33:16.672]  Thank you for allowing us to be a little part of your show.
[02:33:17.352 --> 02:33:19.853]  And you're right, water is extremely important.
[02:33:19.873 --> 02:33:22.013]  I want to give people a little something to think about today.
[02:33:22.033 --> 02:33:24.314]  I'd like to flip coins, so to speak.
[02:33:25.083 --> 02:33:29.325]  On one side of the coin, simple things are happening around the world.
[02:33:29.345 --> 02:33:30.525]  It's not just here in the U.S.
[02:33:31.145 --> 02:33:31.946]  Boil orders.
[02:33:32.006 --> 02:33:34.667]  Last month, several of them popped up in the news.
[02:33:35.007 --> 02:33:36.467]  New Zealand, Bay of Islands.
[02:33:36.867 --> 02:33:41.589]  Water there deemed not safe to drink for a few days as raw sewage is flowing into the harbor.
[02:33:42.489 --> 02:33:46.051]  Zion, Winter Harbor, Illinois Beach State Park near Chicago last month.
[02:33:46.391 --> 02:33:47.471]  Water main breaks there.
[02:33:47.751 --> 02:33:49.552]  People told, boil your water.
[02:33:50.152 --> 02:33:52.033]  Waterville, Maine, the same thing happens.
[02:33:52.601 --> 02:33:54.162]  Bellasitos, New Mexico.
[02:33:55.502 --> 02:33:58.184]  Buckhead, near Atlanta, Georgia.
[02:33:58.824 --> 02:33:59.204]  All of them.
[02:33:59.524 --> 02:34:00.225]  Just last month.
[02:34:00.265 --> 02:34:00.845]  Simple things.
[02:34:00.865 --> 02:34:02.466]  You know, a water main breaks here.
[02:34:02.806 --> 02:34:05.667]  Something gets into the water there and people are told, hey, guess what?
[02:34:05.687 --> 02:34:08.989]  The water coming out of your pipes, not safe to drink right now.
[02:34:09.309 --> 02:34:10.069]  Please boil it.
[02:34:10.089 --> 02:34:12.190]  Flip the coin over.
[02:34:12.430 --> 02:34:13.491]  Let's go to the other extreme.
[02:34:14.371 --> 02:34:16.012]  Hurricane season is starting.
[02:34:17.361 --> 02:34:20.143]  Next month, June 1st for the Atlantic Ocean.
[02:34:20.683 --> 02:34:26.086]  It starts next week for the Eastern Pacific and June 1 for the Central Pacific Ocean.
[02:34:27.426 --> 02:34:30.268]  Granted, these are conventional dates that people assign.
[02:34:30.988 --> 02:34:32.549]  Generally, they'll happen between this date and that.
[02:34:32.989 --> 02:34:35.250]  Does not mean they're restricted, obviously.
[02:34:35.950 --> 02:34:39.712]  What I didn't know and learned just recently is this is all forecasted ahead of time.
[02:34:40.172 --> 02:34:45.115]  There's a group at Colorado State University and NOAA who both get together and go
[02:34:45.669 --> 02:34:48.872]  Okay, we think the season is going to be like this.
[02:34:48.892 --> 02:34:54.818]  Well, December, they actually issued their forecast for the coming 2007 season.
[02:34:55.379 --> 02:35:00.023]  And they were predicting an above average activity type of year.
[02:35:01.184 --> 02:35:04.507]  Last month, they revised that forecast.
[02:35:04.828 --> 02:35:07.911]  They're now calling for a very active hurricane season.
[02:35:09.335 --> 02:35:17.118]  Now, 9 times out of 10 in the last 30 years plus, they've been doing this, I saw a special on it, and I've read some of the numbers, they're 9 times out of 10, they're right.
[02:35:17.599 --> 02:35:26.402]  Last year, they were completely wrong, it was a slow hurricane season, but they were right the year before that with Katrina, so they're usually right.
[02:35:27.122 --> 02:35:27.883]  They are, that is correct.
[02:35:27.903 --> 02:35:29.083]  They're usually very, very close.
[02:35:29.784 --> 02:35:38.327]  What they're predicting is up to, potentially, 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 5 intense hurricanes for this year.
[02:35:38.891 --> 02:35:44.497]  They're attributing this change, and an increase actually, due to the rapid dissipation of El Nino conditions.
[02:35:45.158 --> 02:35:51.445]  The potential for at least one major hurricane impacting the U.S., and those are their predictions now, 74%.
[02:35:51.786 --> 02:35:52.707]  On the eastern coast of the U.S., 50%.
[02:35:52.747 --> 02:35:54.048]  Flip a coin, it's 1 in 2.
[02:36:00.254 --> 02:36:01.976]  But then, let's put all that aside.
[02:36:01.996 --> 02:36:17.172]  I mean, my reason to have water filters is because even, they take the sewage type water, and even if it isn't toilet tap like LA, which anybody can drink that, I have no idea, or Houston, or Dallas, or Detroit, or Chicago, whatever, or New York, San Francisco,
[02:36:18.018 --> 02:36:20.779]  And they put chlorine and all that stuff in it to kill the bacteria.
[02:36:20.799 --> 02:36:22.560]  You're still drinking all those dead bacteria.
[02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:25.882]  With a big murky, you're knocking all those bacteria out.
[02:36:26.262 --> 02:36:28.483]  Even with a sports bottle, you're cutting all of those out.
[02:36:28.503 --> 02:36:32.265]  It doesn't get all the chemicals out, but it makes it safe to drink with a sport and reduces it all.
[02:36:32.585 --> 02:36:37.267]  With the big murkies, the black element and the British white elements, it cuts them down to non-detectable levels.
[02:36:37.307 --> 02:36:46.732]  That means a week after they run stuff through this, and they run swamp water through it to test it, that a week later an electron microscope can find nothing but
[02:36:47.652 --> 02:36:49.075]  Scientists won't say there's nothing in it.
[02:36:49.396 --> 02:36:52.401]  They say we couldn't find anything non-detectable is the term.
[02:36:52.421 --> 02:36:53.924]  You have two university studies on that.
[02:36:53.964 --> 02:36:55.567]  Folks can get those from Debbie if they want them.
[02:36:56.048 --> 02:36:58.312]  Give Debbie Morrow, a great lady, a call.
[02:36:58.332 --> 02:36:58.352]  888-
[02:37:00.384 --> 02:37:02.285]  803-4438, 888-803-4438.
[02:37:02.345 --> 02:37:14.014]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones Special to get a free sports bottle, a potassium iodide or sheltering in place DVD on how to prepare your home for disasters.
[02:37:14.555 --> 02:37:21.620]  When you tell them that, and literally, on average you're getting about a third off or more what you would pay for these very units.
[02:37:21.700 --> 02:37:25.243]  And by the way folks, their main business, 90% of it Jim was telling me,
[02:37:25.663 --> 02:37:26.183]  Thank you.
[02:37:44.591 --> 02:38:05.980]  Or go to InfoWars.com, on the left hand side there's a link to their banner, to BerkeyWater.com, put in the comment section, it's an Alex Jones special for the discount, and what free gift you want, or order them off of our shopping cart, and we fax the orders to them daily and they fulfill those, they ship them to you UPS, they have great customer service, I wish ours was as good as theirs, they are great people, you guys really are great.
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:15.885]  And 888-803-4438, that's newmillenniumconcepts or berkeywater.com or infowars.com.
[02:38:16.165 --> 02:38:27.231]  And I'll say it again, Adam, I mean, this is the name and they're patriots and you guys are Christians and it's a discount and it's made in America and the water's full of poison.
[02:38:27.411 --> 02:38:27.851]  I use it.
[02:38:28.351 --> 02:38:30.376]  I don't know how our listeners are out there listening.
[02:38:30.416 --> 02:38:34.044]  I know most of you are still drinking tap water or bottled water that has its own problems.
[02:38:34.345 --> 02:38:36.450]  You're insane if you don't call and get a Big Berkey.
[02:38:37.510 --> 02:38:38.371]  We appreciate it, Alex.
[02:38:38.391 --> 02:38:40.593]  We really, really believe in what we do.
[02:38:40.713 --> 02:38:43.575]  We believe in getting the water purified before you get it in your body.
[02:38:43.875 --> 02:38:44.756]  Two or three days, that's it.
[02:38:44.796 --> 02:38:46.117]  That's all you're going to last without water.
[02:38:46.537 --> 02:38:51.481]  You don't have a whole lot of time, and it's something to think about and be prepared for eventuality.
[02:38:51.881 --> 02:38:56.925]  If, again, something simple as a boil water problem, or we're looking at something major like a hurricane.
[02:38:57.305 --> 02:38:57.805]  Absolutely.
[02:38:57.825 --> 02:38:59.346]  I appreciate you joining us, Adam.
[02:38:59.507 --> 02:39:00.067]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:39:00.968 --> 02:39:03.950]  And folks, I believe in the products that I push here.
[02:39:05.021 --> 02:39:06.042]  And I believe in this.
[02:39:06.102 --> 02:39:09.884]  You know, in my attic, I've got a two-year food supply.
[02:39:11.185 --> 02:39:15.528]  In my garage, I have two Berkeys, the travel Berkeys.
[02:39:15.568 --> 02:39:17.149]  They do like a gallon at a time.
[02:39:18.190 --> 02:39:19.311]  In boxes, waiting.
[02:39:19.431 --> 02:39:21.492]  I have one, two in my house, office.
[02:39:22.813 --> 02:39:23.273]  I use it.
[02:39:23.934 --> 02:39:33.000]  Now, we use reverse osmosis for really big jobs like boiling and making things, but then we also want the big Berkeys so we get some water that still has the nutritious minerals in it.
[02:39:34.351 --> 02:39:48.495]  But, I mean, it's just, you know, it's like you've been eating steak your whole life and until you've had, you know, the properly, you know, cooked filet mignon, you just don't know what the real thing was until you had it.
[02:39:49.995 --> 02:39:50.895]  And I don't know how.
[02:39:50.975 --> 02:39:52.896]  I mean, I grew up in Dallas, Texas, drinking the water.
[02:39:52.916 --> 02:40:02.878]  I remember as a child, it tasted horrible, it would give me a headache, and I just didn't know what water was like.
[02:40:03.999 --> 02:40:05.180]  I didn't know what water was like.
[02:40:06.420 --> 02:40:08.882]  And I'm done talking about it.
[02:40:10.122 --> 02:40:12.603]  Alright, I said I would get into Israel.
[02:40:13.284 --> 02:40:14.044]  Where are my notes?
[02:40:14.284 --> 02:40:15.505]  I wrote these notes yesterday.
[02:40:15.525 --> 02:40:20.327]  And we played a clip from Fox News.
[02:40:22.348 --> 02:40:31.213]  From weeks after 9-11 where they arrested hundreds of these Israeli art students who said they were really demolition experts and special ops and electronic surveillance.
[02:40:31.852 --> 02:40:35.773]  They've infiltrated police departments, sheriff's departments, FBI, CIA.
[02:40:37.634 --> 02:40:38.574]  They don't need to do that now.
[02:40:38.614 --> 02:40:41.855]  They've got Benjamin, Michael Chertoff, and all the rest of them up there.
[02:40:43.996 --> 02:40:48.357]  And there's no doubt that Israel stages terror attacks in Israel every time there's about to be a peace deal.
[02:40:48.397 --> 02:40:49.017]  They've been caught.
[02:40:49.057 --> 02:40:49.917]  It's been in Herat.
[02:40:49.957 --> 02:40:51.038]  It's been in Jerusalem Post.
[02:40:51.438 --> 02:40:52.078]  We've covered that.
[02:40:52.098 --> 02:40:53.358]  We've covered the USS Liberty.
[02:40:54.319 --> 02:41:00.381]  And the disinfo agents, when we then point out that our government was in collusion, premeditatedly, to park the ship out,
[02:41:02.365 --> 02:41:08.188]  LBJ, to then have Israel attack it, people say, well that means you're leer-butting Israel off the hook.
[02:41:08.248 --> 02:41:08.768]  No I'm not!
[02:41:09.328 --> 02:41:20.293]  I'm giving you what the admirals said, what Jag admirals said, what the first mate said, what the doctor said, what Ward Boston said.
[02:41:20.333 --> 02:41:22.234]  We've interviewed, all those interviews are on my site.
[02:41:22.894 --> 02:41:23.495]  They said it!
[02:41:24.175 --> 02:41:26.576]  We just go order the eyewitnesses and what they said!
[02:41:26.596 --> 02:41:28.517]  But see that's how
[02:41:30.347 --> 02:41:31.588]  That's how COINTELPRO works.
[02:41:31.608 --> 02:41:51.944]  You see, we're all about bringing people together, moving forward, getting you to be a leader, getting you to focus on issues of significance, getting you to pick a Second Amendment issue, border issue, fake environmental folks to fight, you know, waking people up, pick an issue, fight it, or get a media, a website, radio show, to cover everything, mobilize the people.
[02:41:53.426 --> 02:41:54.086]  We can win.
[02:41:54.146 --> 02:41:55.027]  We can take action.
[02:41:55.067 --> 02:41:56.068]  We're having victories.
[02:41:57.461 --> 02:42:00.644]  Instead, a lot of people have been exposed as being feds over the last few decades.
[02:42:01.105 --> 02:42:02.306]  There's always new crops out of them.
[02:42:02.686 --> 02:42:05.929]  They sit up there, and man, they put out the most vile stuff about Jews.
[02:42:06.570 --> 02:42:12.415]  And it's so obviously nothing but racist and toothless and meant to look stupid.
[02:42:12.576 --> 02:42:20.863]  And then they mix in all these real things about the New World Order and real things about the Federal Reserve to discredit all of that.
[02:42:21.935 --> 02:42:26.498]  Mainline people, who we would convince, who we would wake up, will be tainted, see?
[02:42:26.838 --> 02:42:28.079]  And will walk away.
[02:42:28.159 --> 02:42:29.819]  They're literally poisoning the well.
[02:42:30.740 --> 02:42:33.642]  And lo and behold, we've caught the ADL connected groups.
[02:42:34.802 --> 02:42:40.325]  You know, when they want to pass a hate law in Idaho, having guys out there hailing Hitler, and it turns out the PO Box is run by a rabbi.
[02:42:41.746 --> 02:42:47.129]  FBI creating Klan groups from Alabama to Texas, trying to get them to carry out terror attacks, just to have that newsflash.
[02:42:47.189 --> 02:42:50.491]  Klan wants to blow you up, to then pass hate laws for everybody.
[02:42:52.401 --> 02:42:58.802]  They'll fund the black groups and the black professors that say kill all the whites so that any other black groups will look bad that are alternative.
[02:43:00.363 --> 02:43:03.303]  I mean, they know what they're doing, folks, and it's the New World Order doing it.
[02:43:04.483 --> 02:43:10.425]  And, again, it's come out that the Zionists did.
[02:43:10.485 --> 02:43:12.625]  You can go read, just type Zionists supported Hitler.
[02:43:12.885 --> 02:43:13.605]  Pop it into Google.
[02:43:14.165 --> 02:43:16.266]  Mainstream treatises, Ph.D.
[02:43:16.306 --> 02:43:17.806]  papers, best-selling books now.
[02:43:18.767 --> 02:43:27.394]  uh... mainline stuff uh... where they have the actual public magazines you know the main zionist publication in europe and germany saying it's great
[02:43:28.132 --> 02:43:35.456]  You know, one cow in Palestine is worth more than all the Orthodox Jews in Germany.
[02:43:35.577 --> 02:43:36.037]  Ha ha.
[02:43:36.357 --> 02:43:37.558]  Look what Hitler's doing to them.
[02:43:37.838 --> 02:43:43.361]  Then Zionists would make Jews pay them huge payoffs, which they pay part of to Hitler to let Jews get out.
[02:43:43.862 --> 02:43:54.088]  They were instrumental in not letting Jews get out to New York or London and having FDR and others, Neville Chamberlain, and then he even wrote about it.
[02:43:57.092 --> 02:44:02.835]  Winston Churchill not letting, you know, making deals to not let Jews get out, to make them go to Israel.
[02:44:03.995 --> 02:44:05.716]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:44:07.037 --> 02:44:09.718]  And of course, a lot of Jews have written about this now.
[02:44:12.419 --> 02:44:18.602]  The actual Semitic Jews, who are predominantly actually Hebrew, or from those tribes,
[02:44:20.087 --> 02:44:30.757]  They get in trouble if they're seen dating the Tazarian or the Ashkenazi group in Israel.
[02:44:30.797 --> 02:44:32.078]  Whole books have been written on that.
[02:44:32.158 --> 02:44:34.781]  And I mean, they've killed Jews who spoke out about it.
[02:44:35.281 --> 02:44:36.802]  I mean, it's incredible, folks.
[02:44:36.883 --> 02:44:40.426]  It's absolutely incredible that this type of stuff goes on.
[02:44:41.429 --> 02:44:42.449]  And we cover it!
[02:44:42.489 --> 02:44:43.130]  We talk about it!
[02:44:43.150 --> 02:44:52.672]  You know, we have Galen Ross on, and Tex Mars on, and all these people who separate and make it clear, and make a clear distinction between the two.
[02:44:52.712 --> 02:45:02.615]  We're having a real scholarly discussion and a debate about this, and I, a few years ago, played that Fox News piece.
[02:45:02.635 --> 02:45:08.557]  But get this, why did Fox play pieces saying, you know, was Israel involved in 9-11?
[02:45:08.597 --> 02:45:09.337]  Did they know about 9-11?
[02:45:10.819 --> 02:45:12.240]  I mean, that's CIA, folks.
[02:45:12.360 --> 02:45:13.840]  Why would they run that piece?
[02:45:13.880 --> 02:45:16.381]  They were trying to introduce that idea then.
[02:45:18.782 --> 02:45:21.303]  And I just cannot trust anything that comes out of Fox.
[02:45:21.443 --> 02:45:24.805]  But, separately from Fox, we know it's true.
[02:45:26.265 --> 02:45:27.206]  So did it slip through?
[02:45:27.226 --> 02:45:28.426]  I've never seen that happen in the past.
[02:45:30.267 --> 02:45:32.008]  Was there internal fighting in the New World Order?
[02:45:32.028 --> 02:45:34.429]  Was somebody blackmailing Bush and he threatened back?
[02:45:34.489 --> 02:45:37.050]  That's probably most likely from past activities we've seen.
[02:45:40.177 --> 02:45:41.799]  Did the same people set up Nixon?
[02:45:41.859 --> 02:45:42.139]  Yes.
[02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:44.562]  It just goes into hours of history.
[02:45:45.283 --> 02:45:50.268]  But we know that all over the country, police arrested Israelis driving trucks with explosives residue.
[02:45:50.789 --> 02:45:52.591]  We know they had nuclear power plant blueprints.
[02:45:52.611 --> 02:45:55.674]  We know they caught them in the Mexican Congress down in Mexico City.
[02:45:56.916 --> 02:46:12.361]  We know that there's been a lot of stuff going on, and we know about these art students, and we know in the San Diego cell that they were basically living around and tailing, and then connected in with the FBI, supporting some of the supposed hijackers.
[02:46:13.221 --> 02:46:17.723]  But the only thing I've ever said is, Israel couldn't carry out the attacks though.
[02:46:18.843 --> 02:46:21.304]  I mean, you've got, I believe the British are involved as well.
[02:46:22.981 --> 02:46:33.850]  Because if you look at overthrowing Mossadegh, and you look at what's happening in Iraq, and you look at all the past operations, even in Latin America, it's the British, the U.S., and Israel, working together.
[02:46:34.791 --> 02:46:41.397]  And I've given the analogy of three or five, you know, guys, whatever it is, whatever the case may be, rob a bank.
[02:46:41.437 --> 02:46:43.678]  And I'm going, okay, here's the surveillance video.
[02:46:44.099 --> 02:46:45.200]  There's three guys doing it.
[02:46:45.260 --> 02:46:46.461]  And somebody runs up and goes,
[02:46:47.284 --> 02:46:48.805]  You know, how dare you say that?
[02:46:48.845 --> 02:46:50.966]  You know, it's just one guy who did it.
[02:46:51.166 --> 02:46:52.947]  One man did it, and I want one group.
[02:46:53.507 --> 02:46:58.170]  And I'm saying, no, no, they couldn't make NORAD stand down, they couldn't do this, they couldn't do that.
[02:46:58.570 --> 02:46:59.850]  You know, it's one group.
[02:47:00.451 --> 02:47:02.011]  It's like saying Israel and the U.S.
[02:47:02.051 --> 02:47:03.132]  government did the U.S.'
[02:47:03.112 --> 02:47:03.592]  's liberty.
[02:47:03.972 --> 02:47:05.393]  That's what the admirals say.
[02:47:05.413 --> 02:47:06.134]  That's what happened.
[02:47:06.174 --> 02:47:08.255]  That's people that took the call from LBJ.
[02:47:08.275 --> 02:47:09.055]  He knew all about it.
[02:47:09.395 --> 02:47:11.156]  Well, I want that GD thing going to the bottom.
[02:47:11.836 --> 02:47:16.959]  See, I'm just reporting on what the admirals all said, and they hate what Israel did, and they're speaking out against them.
[02:47:17.501 --> 02:47:28.690]  But see, the establishment, and they're definitely shills for the government, there's no doubt of it, will come in and say, oh look, he won't talk about it, he won't hear, he says America did it and Israel did nothing.
[02:47:29.411 --> 02:47:30.472]  I said no such thing.
[02:47:31.693 --> 02:47:40.220]  I legitimately tried to present the facts from the eyewitnesses and the history and the Israeli pilots and all of it, and then you just made something up that I said.
[02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:44.123]  And let me make clear here, I'm not responding to people that attack me, I could care less.
[02:47:45.089 --> 02:47:54.572]  I'm trying to explain to listeners so you can hopefully get a more sophisticated view and a more expansive view of how evil works.
[02:47:56.133 --> 02:47:59.954]  And so you cannot play into their hands, so we can beat the New World Order.
[02:48:00.935 --> 02:48:03.076]  And so we can recruit more people to our movement.
[02:48:03.536 --> 02:48:09.738]  And so when they tune in for the first time, they don't just hear something that sounds like, you know, it's an Aryan Nations meeting.
[02:48:10.598 --> 02:48:12.559]  Because that's controlled by the globalists as well.
[02:48:13.621 --> 02:48:17.042]  You know, I mean, these people call me and email me and they go, Hitler was good.
[02:48:18.002 --> 02:48:19.322]  You know, you've got it all wrong.
[02:48:19.382 --> 02:48:20.362]  No, I've studied Hitler.
[02:48:20.382 --> 02:48:20.982]  He was bad.
[02:48:22.903 --> 02:48:26.683]  You see, they say, it's just, it's just absolutely incredible.
[02:48:27.183 --> 02:48:30.424]  And it makes my head spin, sometimes, to see it.
[02:48:30.724 --> 02:48:32.684]  We'll jam in some final phone calls.
[02:48:33.764 --> 02:48:39.405]  On the other side, don't forget, huge Bruce Willis story on PrisonPlanet.com, Part 2 of that story we did yesterday.
[02:48:39.865 --> 02:48:42.766]  Only you can force the mainstream media to report on this.
[02:48:48.797 --> 02:48:51.960]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.340 --> 02:48:54.262]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.642 --> 02:49:02.289]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.972 --> 02:49:10.015]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.416 --> 02:49:21.861]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.161 --> 02:49:25.663]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.123 --> 02:49:28.044]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.384 --> 02:49:32.226]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:00.276 --> 02:51:05.139]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:05.359 --> 02:51:14.389]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[02:51:48.921 --> 02:51:51.321]  The Queen of England, it's her song!
[02:51:53.002 --> 02:51:55.302]  Oh yeah, this is how we used to treat the Queen.
[02:51:55.322 --> 02:52:00.483]  In 1914 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[02:52:00.503 --> 02:52:05.884]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[02:52:05.924 --> 02:52:08.404]  We fired our guns and the British kept for coming.
[02:52:08.644 --> 02:52:11.065]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[02:52:11.125 --> 02:52:14.185]  We fired once more and they forget to run it.
[02:52:14.205 --> 02:52:16.346]  Down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:52:19.215 --> 02:52:41.848]  We looked down the river and we see the British come And there must have been a hundred of them beatin' on the drums They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they began to runnin' On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico Welcome back!
[02:52:43.789 --> 02:52:46.751]  Old Hick Cree said we could... Watch your camera, there's a bunch of phone calls.
[02:52:46.851 --> 02:52:48.452]  Paul in Ohio, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:52:50.107 --> 02:52:51.909]  I'm still trying to... Are you there?
[02:52:52.630 --> 02:52:52.910]  Yes, sir.
[02:52:52.930 --> 02:52:53.290]  Go ahead.
[02:52:53.610 --> 02:52:59.696]  I'm still trying to find that DVD those two kids made in New Orleans after that disaster that FEMA didn't help with.
[02:52:59.876 --> 02:53:02.558]  Yeah, you called a week ago and I said I'd look into it.
[02:53:02.578 --> 02:53:02.999]  I don't remember.
[02:53:03.019 --> 02:53:03.980]  I had them on as a guest.
[02:53:04.820 --> 02:53:05.701]  And it wasn't really kids.
[02:53:05.761 --> 02:53:07.903]  It was like, you know, 25, 30 years old.
[02:53:07.923 --> 02:53:08.964]  Well, can I ask this?
[02:53:09.665 --> 02:53:14.169]  Anybody out there that knows about this DVD about the New Orleans disaster, would you
[02:53:14.608 --> 02:53:17.849]  Please call Alex's show and leave information on how to obtain it.
[02:53:17.909 --> 02:53:18.729]  I can go look it up.
[02:53:18.789 --> 02:53:19.490]  I'm just so busy.
[02:53:19.550 --> 02:53:25.912]  I got work to do lined up, piled up to Kingdom Come, and I walk out of this broadcast booth in about three minutes.
[02:53:25.952 --> 02:53:26.812]  But thank you for the call.
[02:53:27.092 --> 02:53:27.892]  Good to hear from you.
[02:53:28.812 --> 02:53:29.493]  Who's up next?
[02:53:30.753 --> 02:53:31.813]  Edward in Pennsylvania.
[02:53:31.853 --> 02:53:32.414]  You're on the air.
[02:53:32.434 --> 02:53:32.854]  Go ahead.
[02:53:32.874 --> 02:53:34.314]  Hi, Alex.
[02:53:34.654 --> 02:53:40.156]  On the Big Berkey, I've had one for over three years, and my wife won't drink any water but that.
[02:53:40.874 --> 02:53:42.756]  And my family's all got them now, too.
[02:53:42.836 --> 02:53:43.496]  I got them for them.
[02:53:43.857 --> 02:53:44.777]  They're excellent, aren't they?
[02:53:45.178 --> 02:53:45.498]  Yes.
[02:53:46.078 --> 02:54:07.195]  But, uh, the reason I'm calling in is, uh, anybody that's from Pennsylvania that might be listening, there's an alert, uh, by a Representative Marshall, and they can go to Rep- Representative R-R-E-P Marshall, M-A-R-S-H-A-L-L dot com, and it's on gun control law petition against HB 760.
[02:54:09.281 --> 02:54:11.502]  They want to register and tax all the guns.
[02:54:12.362 --> 02:54:14.843]  Yeah, I got a letter about that, yeah.
[02:54:15.523 --> 02:54:21.105]  Yeah, well, anyway, if anybody's listening, get on the list and start spreading the word.
[02:54:21.165 --> 02:54:23.246]  Again, repeat where that's happening?
[02:54:23.706 --> 02:54:33.929]  That's RepresentativeMarshall.com, but they have it R-E-P-M-A-R-S-H-A-L-L.com.
[02:54:34.949 --> 02:54:36.490]  Yeah, but tell them what state.
[02:54:37.145 --> 02:54:37.885]  Pennsylvania.
[02:54:38.206 --> 02:54:40.067]  Yeah, I was just reading that bill last night.
[02:54:40.447 --> 02:54:41.127]  I mean, there you are.
[02:54:41.167 --> 02:54:41.868]  They want your guns.
[02:54:41.888 --> 02:54:42.648]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:43.188 --> 02:54:44.529]  I appreciate it.
[02:54:44.769 --> 02:54:46.250]  Kevin, in Illinois.
[02:54:46.270 --> 02:54:46.810]  You're on the air.
[02:54:46.890 --> 02:54:47.471]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:54:47.931 --> 02:54:48.411]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:48.451 --> 02:54:49.212]  First time caller.
[02:54:49.312 --> 02:54:49.652]  Welcome.
[02:54:50.012 --> 02:54:53.494]  I had a question, just kind of to get your prediction on it.
[02:54:53.594 --> 02:54:57.436]  I know that they want to reduce the population down to 500 million.
[02:54:57.817 --> 02:55:00.258]  I know they want to take a complete takeover on all of us.
[02:55:01.129 --> 02:55:03.670]  My question is, if that happened, what's next?
[02:55:03.890 --> 02:55:04.730]  What's going to happen?
[02:55:04.750 --> 02:55:05.850]  I mean, what are they going to get out of it?
[02:55:05.870 --> 02:55:08.271]  Well, I mean, it's all going to be drone and robot and force.
[02:55:08.331 --> 02:55:19.834]  Everything's going to be mechanized with tiny elites in their walls, central cities, and then major preserves, with just little suboid slave groups, and that's their public plan.
[02:55:20.612 --> 02:55:22.093]  And they're publicly going for it.
[02:55:22.373 --> 02:55:25.734]  And we've got to resist at that point if they make it that far.
[02:55:26.235 --> 02:55:27.235]  I don't think they will, though.
[02:55:27.275 --> 02:55:28.335]  This thing's going to fall apart.
[02:55:28.756 --> 02:55:29.456]  Oh, yeah, I agree.
[02:55:29.496 --> 02:55:33.998]  They'll probably destroy everything in the process, but, you know, at least they won't have their way.
[02:55:34.018 --> 02:55:34.858]  Yeah.
[02:55:35.299 --> 02:55:36.179]  Well, that's all I wanted to know.
[02:55:36.759 --> 02:55:36.979]  Thank you.
[02:55:36.999 --> 02:55:37.660]  Good to hear from you.
[02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:38.460]  Good to hear from you.
[02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:39.820]  Bill in Baltimore, last caller.
[02:55:39.881 --> 02:55:40.201]  Go ahead.
[02:55:40.241 --> 02:55:40.981]  You have one minute.
[02:55:41.401 --> 02:55:41.741]  Hi, Alex.
[02:55:41.821 --> 02:55:43.622]  I was just calling in for encouragement.
[02:55:43.682 --> 02:55:44.823]  I think things are getting better.
[02:55:44.863 --> 02:55:46.403]  Last year, I felt like they were getting worse.
[02:55:46.984 --> 02:55:49.925]  But I feel something definitely different when I'm talking to people this year.
[02:55:50.501 --> 02:55:53.143]  My neighbor said he wanted some of the DVDs.
[02:55:53.203 --> 02:55:56.825]  I forgot to give them, but he actually wanted burned DVDs to see how they played.
[02:55:56.886 --> 02:56:03.430]  I gave them Martial Law 9-1-1 and Terror Storm, because you're always saying push Terror Storm.
[02:56:03.710 --> 02:56:04.151]  Thank you!
[02:56:05.131 --> 02:56:07.173]  And go visit InfoWarsForum.com.
[02:56:07.213 --> 02:56:08.514]  Everybody resist.
[02:56:08.554 --> 02:56:09.334]  There are no guns.
[02:56:10.115 --> 02:56:11.176]  The guns do not exist.
[02:56:13.037 --> 02:56:14.518]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:56:15.685 --> 02:56:21.269]  I hope people will get TerrorStorm at Infowars.com and I hope they will get it out to people because that's a big part of the fight.
[02:56:21.289 --> 02:56:22.530]  Alright, God bless you all.
[02:56:22.570 --> 02:56:22.951]  Take care.
