[00:00:05.386 --> 00:00:06.026]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:07.768]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.468 --> 00:00:09.749]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:11.050]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:12.671]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.372 --> 00:00:17.034]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:23.319]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:29.803]  We are on the trail of another massive 9-11 inside job story.
[00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:33.246]  That is...
[00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:56.420]  As big as the WTC7 cover-up unraveling at the BBC, as well as CNN, joining us in the second hour of this Wednesday, March 7, 2007 edition, David Hawkins and Captain Field McConnell will both be joining us on the air.
[00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:03.702]  Yesterday, in the third hour, we interviewed the Northwest Airlines pilot who resigned on Monday
[00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:14.677]  Discussing the information he has about remote control override systems he claims are in many Boeing manufactured aircraft.
[00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:18.620]  And since then, we've done a lot of research.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.582]  The listeners went absolutely aped at a bunch of research.
[00:01:23.123 --> 00:01:24.844]  And this is a massive story.
[00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.186]  When we get back from break, I'm going to break down why
[00:01:28.223 --> 00:01:41.446]  Regardless if this captain or David Hawkins are correct, it's a big story period because it caused us to flesh out new information that was hidden in plain view.
[00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:44.527]  You know, that happens so many times.
[00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:50.328]  About a year and a half ago I sued Access Television in the city of Austin.
[00:01:51.568 --> 00:01:53.489]  This is just a little small local issue.
[00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:59.351]  Because they were trying to violate their charter and destroy the First Amendment, basically shut the place down.
[00:01:59.732 --> 00:02:02.335]  And in the process, we discovered massive fraud.
[00:02:02.635 --> 00:02:11.504]  Their director was convicted of 47 years in prison, commuted down to 9 years in prison, and they're hot on the trail of others.
[00:02:11.544 --> 00:02:12.806]  We know he was just the front man.
[00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:18.249]  And so I kind of liken that local event to this.
[00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:31.537]  We start looking at one facet of the hundreds of smoking guns of 9-11 because of a claim of a pilot and a forensic scientist, forensic economist,
[00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:48.616]  And it leads us into a whole area that we frankly haven't spent enough time on, and you the listeners go out there and ferret about and have found just masses of mainstream documentation that is extremely troubling.
[00:02:50.698 --> 00:02:51.759]  Extremely troubling.
[00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:57.425]  There's a big report out by Paul Watson up on PrisonPlanet.com with the headline,
[00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:06.932]  Concerning a pilot going public saying there are explosives on many of the planes wired into these remote control systems.
[00:03:07.092 --> 00:03:08.053]  I don't know if that's true.
[00:03:08.393 --> 00:03:09.834]  I hope to God that's not the case.
[00:03:10.275 --> 00:03:12.917]  I believe that Captain Field McConnell believes that.
[00:03:13.277 --> 00:03:17.300]  And he says that David Hawkins, this researcher, has more evidence of it.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.941]  Mr. Hawkins did send us some evidence.
[00:03:19.542 --> 00:03:22.884]  I'm literally trying to wade through hundreds of pages.
[00:03:23.645 --> 00:03:25.506]  And then I've got all the stuff listeners sent us.
[00:03:25.566 --> 00:03:27.928]  I was up late last night trying to read over all this.
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.381]  Until about 2 a.m.
[00:03:31.401 --> 00:03:35.764]  And by the time I get back on air at 11 a.m.
[00:03:35.804 --> 00:03:45.210]  I'm a little bit flustered, but we'll try to codify it and go over it all, because it's like trying to drink out of a fire hose that's on high here.
[00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:51.134]  But we'll try to make sense of it all today.
[00:03:52.855 --> 00:03:57.839]  Also, Senator Hagel suggests possibility of Bush impeachment.
[00:03:58.279 --> 00:03:59.680]  He's not accountable anymore.
[00:04:00.382 --> 00:04:09.106]  This out today, also out today, on Wednesday, Iran warns of serious response if more sanctions.
[00:04:09.827 --> 00:04:12.748]  Taiwan tests missile capable of hitting China.
[00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.231]  Verdict in Libby perjury trial leaves Cheney exposed.
[00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:21.393]  Democratic lawmakers respond to verdicts say don't pardon Libby.
[00:04:23.274 --> 00:04:25.895]  Will Bush pardon Scooter Libby is the big question.
[00:04:27.336 --> 00:04:32.938]  The jurors are explaining in the Libby verdict that they felt he was a fall guy and felt sorry for him.
[00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:37.179]  There's a bill to block credit cards for illegal aliens.
[00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:41.581]  It's like yesterday.
[00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:43.842]  They discovered a huge hole in the Earth's crust.
[00:04:43.902 --> 00:04:50.504]  Associated Press, massive news story, turns all they know about tectonic plate activity on its head.
[00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:52.885]  I spent 15 seconds on it, didn't even cover it.
[00:04:52.905 --> 00:04:55.826]  I'm gonna try to dig into the stack from yesterday, cover that too today.
[00:04:56.844 --> 00:04:59.107]  It's just, there's so much news.
[00:04:59.387 --> 00:04:59.988]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:04.733]  It's here.
[00:05:04.933 --> 00:05:09.719]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:17.668]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:25.484]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.864 --> 00:05:37.311]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.611 --> 00:05:41.114]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:43.495]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.835 --> 00:05:47.678]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:04.894]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:06:04.934 --> 00:06:05.414]  are located?
[00:06:05.634 --> 00:06:09.016]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:13.960]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.223]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:06:19.483 --> 00:06:20.063]  We're good to go.
[00:06:38.171 --> 00:06:38.832]  We're good to go.
[00:07:02.884 --> 00:07:07.027]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:07.247 --> 00:07:09.008]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:15.553]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:15.853 --> 00:07:21.977]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:22.218 --> 00:07:28.262]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[00:07:28.542 --> 00:07:34.947]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:38.650]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:42.654]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[00:07:42.834 --> 00:07:45.376]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:07:45.516 --> 00:07:47.818]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:07:48.018 --> 00:07:50.359]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll-free 1-866-885-6625.
[00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:50.900]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:50.980]  1-866-885-6625.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.142]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:54.162 --> 00:07:55.423]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:25.771]  Just recapping what I said in the last segment.
[00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:34.155]  We're hot on the trail of a very important facet of the 9-11 inside job investigation.
[00:08:34.175 --> 00:08:47.422]  We'll be delving into that in great detail at the bottom of this hour, into the second hour, with David Hawkins, who is a forensic economist for disaster analysis
[00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:52.837]  We've got him joining us as well as Captain Field McConnell.
[00:08:54.277 --> 00:08:59.418]  Field McConnell is going to be in ABC Studios doing a live news piece, but then he'll be joining us via cell phone.
[00:09:00.438 --> 00:09:06.600]  And then we're going to have David Hawking joining us from his home.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.181]  Now, let me just recap.
[00:09:11.981 --> 00:09:14.201]  I believe these men believe what they're saying.
[00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:17.302]  I don't know if their report
[00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:19.664]  is completely accurate.
[00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:44.647]  We're trying to vet that, but this is very serious when a Northwest Airlines pilot, in good standing, goes public for the last two months, resigns on Monday, puts in for early retirement, and is now suing the government, claiming that they have allowed Boeing, or suing Boeing, and saying that the government has allowed them to illegally put in a remote control gyro chip
[00:09:45.729 --> 00:09:48.490]  into many of their Boeing aircraft in their fleet.
[00:09:50.890 --> 00:10:12.215]  And then he claims that can be connected to explosive bolts in the doors as some part of an anti-terrorism program that's secret so that if an aircraft is hijacked on the ground they can blow the doors off so it can't be pressurized or take off and so anti-terror SWAT teams can enter.
[00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:17.621]  And they say they'll bring forward evidence of that today, coming up in the second hour.
[00:10:17.681 --> 00:10:19.142]  Now that part I haven't confirmed.
[00:10:19.682 --> 00:10:20.702]  I believe they believe it.
[00:10:22.543 --> 00:10:30.727]  But their other claims about this specific chip name, about the fact that it's been covertly tested, is accurate.
[00:10:30.787 --> 00:10:35.429]  And Boeing has made statements claiming they haven't implemented this, claiming it doesn't exist.
[00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:40.631]  And then we have other statements where they say it does exist, and where they've given interviews freely
[00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:45.978]  To the press on this subject.
[00:10:47.118 --> 00:10:54.024]  So we'll start walking through the basics of this in about 22 minutes from now when we come back out of break at 33 after.
[00:10:55.405 --> 00:10:57.347]  Then our guests will join us in the second hour.
[00:10:57.387 --> 00:11:01.751]  In the third hour I'm going to shift gears into other news and of course open the phones up and take your calls.
[00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:12.736]  We may even open the phones up for quick comments later in the next half hour so that you can comment specifically.
[00:11:12.796 --> 00:11:19.060]  I'd like you to call in on the issue of the guidance systems and any points or topics or news articles you've come across.
[00:11:21.542 --> 00:11:29.547]  But again, all the stuff we discovered since we announced this yesterday, thanks to you listeners ferreting out these reports and transcripts, that's coming up.
[00:11:30.939 --> 00:11:37.187]  In the meantime, Senator Hagel, who's a top Vilderberg group gopher, or legate,
[00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:45.833]  is set in the new Esquire to be on store magazine racks in the next week.
[00:11:46.313 --> 00:11:49.596]  ThinkProgress website has this.
[00:11:49.976 --> 00:11:53.459]  Hagel suggests possibility of Bush impeachment.
[00:11:53.499 --> 00:11:55.901]  He's not accountable anymore.
[00:11:56.441 --> 00:12:05.688]  According to a new report in Esquire magazine, Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican, Nebraska, who owns the voting machine company, people vote for him on it,
[00:12:06.374 --> 00:12:12.280]  Has suggested that Congress may consider the impeachment of President Bush before his term ends.
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.783]  And they have a link to Esquire promoing this, so it's confirmed.
[00:12:16.404 --> 00:12:28.455]  The President says, I don't care, he's not accountable anymore, Hagel says, measuring his words by the syllable and his syllables almost by the letter, he's not accountable anymore, which isn't
[00:12:29.511 --> 00:12:30.252]  Totally true.
[00:12:30.752 --> 00:12:32.934]  You can impeach him before this is over.
[00:12:33.314 --> 00:12:35.476]  You might see calls for his impeachment.
[00:12:35.576 --> 00:12:36.097]  I don't know.
[00:12:36.457 --> 00:12:38.619]  It depends on how this goes.
[00:12:42.302 --> 00:12:49.429]  Now, they did vote, what, 4-1 in the Judiciary Committee in the New Mexico Legislature yesterday.
[00:12:49.449 --> 00:12:50.670]  This came in at the end of the show.
[00:12:51.662 --> 00:12:53.483]  I dropped the ball and didn't cover it.
[00:12:53.783 --> 00:12:59.765]  And now it's going to be going to the full Senate in New Mexico as early as today.
[00:12:59.785 --> 00:13:05.406]  In fact, we might want to get Lerman on for just five minutes in the third hour, Kevin, to give us an update on that.
[00:13:06.667 --> 00:13:12.568]  And then that would go to the House of Representatives federally, where they could have an up or down vote, but it does broach the subject and bring it in.
[00:13:12.608 --> 00:13:17.610]  And other states are moving, like Vermont, with similar resolutions.
[00:13:19.858 --> 00:13:21.700]  Why is this important?
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.743]  Senator Hagel goes to many of the Bilderberg Group meetings.
[00:13:25.863 --> 00:13:46.962]  He has been quoted by inside sources going back to pre-Iraq attack in 2002, where the big split between the Anglo-American faction, Anglo-American British faction, the dominant faction, with the next most powerful faction of the five major factions, the European faction, which are joined like Siamese twins at the hip.
[00:13:49.153 --> 00:13:54.234]  and share many of the same organs, literally, in their whole apparatchik.
[00:13:54.254 --> 00:14:10.079]  A major split that has only been intensified and deepened and accentuated over the globalists that one arm believing that the Iraq war is endangering their entire program that they believe should be incremental.
[00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:32.053]  And so to have Hagel out talking like this, this isn't the first time, really shows that there is an attempt to rein Bush in, and to stop an attack on Iran by a large faction of the global system, the global crime system, the global crime syndicate.
[00:14:32.774 --> 00:14:39.419]  It's literally a syndicate, they meet around big tables and debate it all out, and they have the same agenda, just differences on how it should be implemented.
[00:14:39.739 --> 00:14:41.441]  So there's that report on Hagel,
[00:14:43.846 --> 00:14:47.750]  This is out of a French news agency, Agency French Press.
[00:14:48.131 --> 00:14:51.354]  Iran warns of serious response if more sanctions.
[00:14:51.855 --> 00:14:58.642]  World powers will receive a serious response from Iran if they adopt a new UN resolution imposing more sanctions over its atomic drive.
[00:14:58.983 --> 00:15:03.708]  Top nuclear negotiator Ali Larajani warned today.
[00:15:04.757 --> 00:15:08.599]  They go ahead in an extreme manner and issue a resolution.
[00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:11.820]  They will receive a serious answer and the conditions will change.
[00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:17.463]  Lariani was quoted as saying by the state run INRA agency.
[00:15:20.264 --> 00:15:21.124]  So we're dealing with that.
[00:15:22.165 --> 00:15:22.785]  It goes on.
[00:15:23.954 --> 00:15:26.815]  Issuing a resolution will affect many things, he said, without elaborating.
[00:15:27.156 --> 00:15:41.983]  Ambassadors from the UN Security Council's five permanent members, plus Germany, are mulling new sanctions over Iran and its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment operations, which they fear could be diverted to make nuclear weapons.
[00:15:42.423 --> 00:15:45.325]  Oh yeah, at 8% when they need like 90-something percent enrichment.
[00:15:46.045 --> 00:15:47.886]  Diplomats said the world powers hope to
[00:15:48.658 --> 00:15:56.520]  Present a text for the full 15-member council in the next few days, although they are unlikely to agree on a draft resolution this week.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.401]  In reality, there are two paths in front of them.
[00:16:00.601 --> 00:16:06.482]  One path is that we should follow this matter through realistic and not artificial negotiations.
[00:16:06.762 --> 00:16:10.023]  We prefer the first path, said Laura Johnny.
[00:16:10.883 --> 00:16:18.085]  The Security Council already agreed a sanctions resolution in December that targeted Iran's nuclear program and ballistics industry.
[00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:22.942]  The new proposed resolution would also include new financial and trade restrictions.
[00:16:23.383 --> 00:16:32.350]  Iran vehemently denies it is seeking nuclear weapons capability and insists it has a right under the Non-Proliferation Treaty to conduct uranium enrichment for electricity generation.
[00:16:34.051 --> 00:16:38.435]  Meanwhile, an escalation in the Taiwan-Chinese split
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.722]  Taiwan test missile capable of hitting China.
[00:16:42.742 --> 00:16:46.084]  Taiwan has tested a medium-range missile capable of hitting Shanghai or Hong Kong.
[00:16:46.124 --> 00:16:48.085]  Reports from the island said today.
[00:16:48.526 --> 00:16:59.493]  President Chin Shuai-Bai personally attended the launch of the Brave Wind 2E missiles last month, according to the United Daily News.
[00:17:00.658 --> 00:17:05.260]  The missiles have a range of 600 miles, bringing large areas of eastern and southern China within range.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:21.768]  The government refused to confirm the report, but it was published as a time of heightened tension between Beijing and the inland island, which has been ruled separately from the mainland since 1949, and which China regards as a renegade province awaiting reunification.
[00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:29.032]  And of course, Bush has moved away, continuing Clinton's policy of not supporting Taiwan in breaking
[00:17:30.291 --> 00:17:34.312]  Our 50-plus year defense treaty with them.
[00:17:34.372 --> 00:17:35.173]  Very shameful.
[00:17:37.053 --> 00:17:37.714]  Continuing.
[00:17:38.694 --> 00:17:41.955]  Verdict in Libby perjury trial leaves Cheney exposed.
[00:17:42.015 --> 00:17:42.875]  Herald Tribune.
[00:17:44.556 --> 00:17:47.317]  In legal terms, the jury has spoken in Libby case.
[00:17:47.377 --> 00:17:50.298]  In political terms, Vice President Dick Cheney is still awaiting a judgment.
[00:17:51.494 --> 00:17:57.216]  We have major publications, I would add, reporting that he may step down because of a blood clot in his leg, a convenient excuse.
[00:17:57.817 --> 00:18:03.759]  For many weeks, Washington Watch transfixed as the trial of I. Louis Libby Jr.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:14.524]  Cass Cheney as former boss in the role of puppeteer, pulling the strings in a covert public relations campaign to defend the administration's case for war in Iraq and discredit a critic.
[00:18:15.964 --> 00:18:20.006]  Really, this looks like a positioning of Condoleezza Rice to run as VP
[00:18:21.135 --> 00:18:42.686]  Or maybe even, as President against Hillary, in this world of tokenism where only your sex matters, or your race, your sub... It just, it just makes my head spin.
[00:18:43.564 --> 00:18:49.566]  That all of these distractionary sub-issues, they're not even issues.
[00:18:49.686 --> 00:19:00.510]  I mean, all of these presidential candidates are bought and paid for by the very same industries, the very same lobbies.
[00:19:02.431 --> 00:19:07.213]  I mean, I guess there's some, there's a few issues in this that are important.
[00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:12.855]  I mean, I guess it's more important than super sub-issues that are non-issues like
[00:19:15.069 --> 00:19:18.090]  Britney Spears shaving her head or the death of Anna Nicole Smith.
[00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:19.831]  It's just amazing.
[00:19:20.151 --> 00:19:31.175]  Democratic lawmakers reopened and are saying that they do not want a pardon for Libby.
[00:19:31.195 --> 00:19:34.836]  I'm trying to rush through all of this.
[00:19:34.857 --> 00:19:36.177]  There's just too much news here.
[00:19:36.957 --> 00:19:39.458]  The big question is will Bush pardon Scooter Libby?
[00:19:39.498 --> 00:19:41.219]  We'll briefly talk about that on the other side.
[00:19:41.992 --> 00:19:45.496]  The jury is saying that they felt he was a fall guy.
[00:19:45.516 --> 00:19:52.324]  Then we'll shift gears into some good news on the illegal alien invasion front.
[00:19:52.924 --> 00:19:55.808]  And then we'll get into what I really want to cover.
[00:19:56.328 --> 00:19:58.270]  The remote control possibilities of 9-11.
[00:20:02.876 --> 00:20:03.917]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:04.237 --> 00:20:07.018]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:07.298 --> 00:20:11.441]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:12.701]  So what do you do?
[00:20:13.021 --> 00:20:17.584]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:18.084 --> 00:20:20.206]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:35.397]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:20:35.437 --> 00:20:42.502]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:20:42.842 --> 00:20:47.248]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[00:21:02.905 --> 00:21:06.589]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:12.396]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:12.876 --> 00:21:13.957]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:13.997 --> 00:21:17.982]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:18.682 --> 00:21:31.988]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:32.008 --> 00:21:37.791]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:38.091 --> 00:21:43.974]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:22:03.208 --> 00:22:05.749]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:14.331]  Did you know the syndicated columnist Charlie Reese once wrote a stinging indictment against the internationalists who have captured our federal government for their own purposes?
[00:22:15.132 --> 00:22:20.093]  He reported that the present government of the United States is systematically undoing our independence.
[00:22:20.865 --> 00:22:28.291]  He said that agreeing to belong to the World Trade Organization and taking orders from it was a deliberate sacrifice of our national sovereignty.
[00:22:29.132 --> 00:22:32.854]  He said the United Nations represents the same threat to our sovereignty.
[00:22:33.715 --> 00:22:42.262]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass and offer you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:02.634 --> 00:23:04.676]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:14.227]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:14.668 --> 00:23:21.876]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:22.589 --> 00:23:28.093]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:46.906 --> 00:23:47.346]  We're good.
[00:24:21.225 --> 00:24:22.546]  Welcome back.
[00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:24.367]  All right.
[00:24:24.528 --> 00:24:25.969]  Bill would block
[00:24:47.455 --> 00:24:49.076]  Credit cards for illegals.
[00:24:49.737 --> 00:24:51.618]  News from CommercialAppeal.com.
[00:24:53.159 --> 00:24:54.600]  One of these financial news sites.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.782]  Blackburn seeks to close loophole in U.S.
[00:24:57.862 --> 00:24:58.803]  banking system.
[00:24:59.643 --> 00:24:59.863]  U.S.
[00:24:59.903 --> 00:25:08.429]  Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican Tennessee, introduced legislation Monday that would prevent illegal immigrants from receiving credit cards from American financial institutions.
[00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:15.554]  The Photo Identification Security Act would require banks to use what Blackburn calls secure forms of identification to obtain credit
[00:25:16.295 --> 00:25:25.940]  In a statement put out by her office, she says, Bank of America has come under fire in response to reports that it allows illegal immigrants access to credit cards without proper identification.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.741]  And they have federal laws on this for citizens.
[00:25:29.222 --> 00:25:30.582]  And the banks go even further.
[00:25:31.423 --> 00:25:32.143]  We did a test.
[00:25:32.163 --> 00:25:37.986]  We sent Kevin Smith in a few weeks ago to Bank of America, down the street from here, where you heard they were just doing this in LA.
[00:25:38.006 --> 00:25:39.147]  Uh-uh, it's nationwide.
[00:25:40.227 --> 00:25:42.989]  And they told him, three forms of ID, buddy.
[00:25:44.249 --> 00:25:45.770]  Just to cash a check in there.
[00:25:47.365 --> 00:25:49.286]  And it's the same thing when you set up a bank account.
[00:25:50.948 --> 00:25:54.530]  And, but, oh my gosh, if you're an illegal alien, you can forget it.
[00:25:55.511 --> 00:25:57.952]  You can go in and get a bank account with no ID.
[00:25:59.013 --> 00:26:11.921]  And then once you have that, you get a tax ID number, housing loans, car loans, and the CEOs of these companies and bank chairmen were in the AP and in the LA Times, two separate articles over three months saying, we're doing this to help strengthen the roots of these groups.
[00:26:13.442 --> 00:26:15.804]  Why, there's a terrible move to kick them out of this country.
[00:26:16.807 --> 00:26:19.409]  And we're just doing this to help them.
[00:26:19.769 --> 00:26:21.391]  How about helping the American people?
[00:26:21.451 --> 00:26:26.634]  The Hispanic Americans, and Black Americans, and White Americans, and Asian Americans, Americans, period.
[00:26:26.995 --> 00:26:29.737]  The point is, your big brother's system is for us, the cattle.
[00:26:30.237 --> 00:26:36.522]  Us, the chumps, the marks, who are here to have everything sucked off of us, and to be pushed around.
[00:26:37.563 --> 00:26:37.923]  Okay?
[00:26:38.303 --> 00:26:40.505]  I'm for no IDs for anybody, by the way.
[00:26:41.221 --> 00:26:42.762]  I know the war on terror is a fraud.
[00:26:42.822 --> 00:26:43.803]  I know it's a scam.
[00:26:44.083 --> 00:26:47.485]  But don't you try to have this two-tier system anymore.
[00:26:47.765 --> 00:26:48.705]  I've had enough of it!
[00:26:51.247 --> 00:26:55.889]  And they have these staged roundups every two months on average where they go arrest on average about 700 people.
[00:26:55.929 --> 00:26:56.750]  Some are 500.
[00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:57.310]  Some are 1,200.
[00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.431]  You've seen the different arrests.
[00:26:58.451 --> 00:26:59.912]  So I just average them together.
[00:27:00.492 --> 00:27:02.133]  700 people on average are arrested.
[00:27:03.073 --> 00:27:05.495]  There are 3 million illegals coming into this country a year.
[00:27:06.395 --> 00:27:07.636]  900 and something thousand illegals.
[00:27:07.656 --> 00:27:09.117]  So that's almost 4 million
[00:27:09.904 --> 00:27:12.906]  Versus, every two months, them arresting 700 and something people.
[00:27:14.547 --> 00:27:19.789]  So you're talking about, what, three, four thousand people getting arrested a year.
[00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.311]  Most of them never even get sent back.
[00:27:23.951 --> 00:27:26.153]  Oh, they're really cracking down on the illegal aliens.
[00:27:26.773 --> 00:27:29.814]  And they've had another one of these highly publicized raids.
[00:27:29.875 --> 00:27:32.016]  It's been two months and they've done it again.
[00:27:32.976 --> 00:27:36.298]  Colorado raided, accused of hiring illegals.
[00:27:40.046 --> 00:27:41.007]  I'm so used to seeing C.O.
[00:27:41.067 --> 00:27:41.647]  as Colorado.
[00:27:41.707 --> 00:27:42.388]  Company-rated.
[00:27:43.049 --> 00:27:47.032]  Company hired illegal immigrants to keep up with military contracts, feds say.
[00:27:47.652 --> 00:27:54.178]  A.P., the owner of three managers of a new Bedford leather manufacturer that won more than a $91 million U.S.
[00:27:54.218 --> 00:27:58.101]  military contracts, were arrested Tuesday for allegedly hiring illegal immigrants.
[00:27:58.501 --> 00:28:00.203]  Hey, why don't you just hire Americans?
[00:28:00.223 --> 00:28:02.324]  You've got these big, fat, no-bid contracts.
[00:28:02.905 --> 00:28:06.107]  At least Americans should make a little bit of money off this stinkin' war.
[00:28:06.127 --> 00:28:06.768]  We're gonna have it.
[00:28:07.248 --> 00:28:07.809]  The company
[00:28:09.219 --> 00:28:10.700]  Michael Bianco Inc.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:15.503]  hired illegal aliens as it tried to meet deadlines to supply backpacks and other products to the military.
[00:28:15.964 --> 00:28:16.324]  Oh yeah.
[00:28:16.724 --> 00:28:19.046]  No, you were greedy and didn't want to pay people a living wage.
[00:28:19.546 --> 00:28:25.790]  Federal officials said in a court filing, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers raided the company Tuesday morning.
[00:28:26.271 --> 00:28:28.352]  In an affidavit, investigators claim that the owner of
[00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:36.034]  It goes on to say they had a whole bunch of illegals working there and it was a sting operation.
[00:28:54.409 --> 00:29:01.873]  Hey, if you got probable cause, folks, all you do is you have these investigators pull up in the parking lot in the morning and say, let me see your green card.
[00:29:02.213 --> 00:29:07.835]  And if they don't have that, that's probable cause, and ten van loads of agents pull up and you go raid the whole place.
[00:29:08.416 --> 00:29:14.839]  You don't need big, long, two-month-long sting operation investigations when you got probable cause!
[00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:24.095]  Oh no, but you'll pull whole families over at illegal, federally funded checkpoints and pull everybody's junk out on the side of the road with no probable cause!
[00:29:24.435 --> 00:29:26.537]  But when you've got probable cause, you won't use it!
[00:29:26.557 --> 00:29:29.499]  It's a joke!
[00:29:31.421 --> 00:29:34.703]  Alright, I didn't get through a tenth of the stack, okay?
[00:29:34.943 --> 00:29:36.104]  I'll get to it in the third hour.
[00:29:36.144 --> 00:29:38.426]  I'm getting into the remote-controlled aircraft.
[00:29:38.987 --> 00:29:40.087]  Big braking developments.
[00:29:40.107 --> 00:29:41.108]  It's just incredible.
[00:29:41.629 --> 00:29:43.070]  When we get back on the other side,
[00:29:44.415 --> 00:29:47.959]  Then I do need to elaborate more on what could happen with this whole Scooter Libby situation.
[00:29:47.979 --> 00:29:49.902]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.624 --> 00:29:52.565]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.025 --> 00:29:54.627]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.548 --> 00:29:58.232]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.309 --> 00:30:04.011]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:30:04.291 --> 00:30:06.353]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:30:06.593 --> 00:30:09.115]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:30:09.576 --> 00:30:13.919]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[00:30:14.039 --> 00:30:14.640]  Here's why.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:21.265]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:30:21.545 --> 00:30:28.048]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[00:30:28.189 --> 00:30:31.931]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:30:32.131 --> 00:30:36.353]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:30:36.833 --> 00:30:44.018]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:30:44.458 --> 00:30:45.158]  Get control.
[00:30:45.299 --> 00:30:45.899]  Get relief.
[00:30:46.099 --> 00:30:46.860]  Get some sleep.

[00:31:01.056 --> 00:31:07.006]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.

[00:31:56.764 --> 00:32:03.248]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:07.531]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[00:32:07.771 --> 00:32:09.932]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[00:32:10.292 --> 00:32:13.034]  All Natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem.
[00:32:13.314 --> 00:32:17.278]  The dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[00:32:17.618 --> 00:32:20.220]  Non-X nail gel is absolutely amazing!
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.023]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[00:32:24.283 --> 00:32:27.206]  Non-X nail gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:32:27.486 --> 00:32:32.150]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.052]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:32:34.332 --> 00:32:36.794]  You'll find Non-X gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X.
[00:32:38.075 --> 00:32:38.275]  Thank you.
[00:33:00.074 --> 00:33:00.555]  Don't worry.
[00:33:01.035 --> 00:33:02.556]  This show is documented.
[00:33:03.077 --> 00:33:05.819]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:06.239 --> 00:33:09.722]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:09.742 --> 00:33:14.266]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:33:14.827 --> 00:33:16.889]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:33:17.709 --> 00:33:19.071]  The ring of fire.
[00:33:20.011 --> 00:33:21.413]  The ring of fire.
[00:33:22.674 --> 00:33:23.955]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:33:24.075 --> 00:33:25.016]  Alright, we're back live.
[00:33:25.769 --> 00:33:41.738]  Before I get into this whole remote control issue and are there explosives on planes story, just giving you the basic facts before our guests are scheduled to join us in the next hour.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:51.344]  Let me just remind all of the listeners out there that are tuning in that I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:54.150]  I have made 15 films.
[00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:58.452]  The latest film is Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:33:58.472 --> 00:34:00.332]  It is the most powerful film I've ever made.
[00:34:00.352 --> 00:34:02.453]  There's over three hours on the DVD.
[00:34:02.513 --> 00:34:03.894]  The film is right under two hours.
[00:34:03.954 --> 00:34:06.015]  It's 114 minutes long.
[00:34:06.035 --> 00:34:15.519]  The extras are 68 minutes of the highlights of the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium we had last June in Los Angeles.
[00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:20.282]  It's worth it to get the DVD just for that.
[00:34:20.322 --> 00:34:22.344]  I mean, great 9-11 information.
[00:34:22.684 --> 00:34:30.391]  The film covers admissions where our government and other governments admit they staged terror attacks or claim they've been attacked to start wars or to crack down on populations.
[00:34:32.232 --> 00:34:39.279]  From Hitler to the Gulf of Tonkin, from Glywoods to Gladio to Ajax to Northwoods.
[00:34:40.976 --> 00:34:44.278]  Then we go to London and cover the 7-7 bombings with precision.
[00:34:44.298 --> 00:34:48.121]  Then we move on from there to the latest 9-11 information and Building 7 info.
[00:34:48.481 --> 00:34:54.205]  Then we expand out into their master plan, the police state, the propaganda.
[00:34:55.686 --> 00:34:58.027]  It really is my best film and the critics have said that.
[00:35:01.369 --> 00:35:03.511]  It's been as high as number 8 on Amazon.com.
[00:35:03.531 --> 00:35:06.253]  You can get it there if you'd like or just get it from Infowars.com.
[00:35:06.273 --> 00:35:08.054]  That's the only one of my films you can get on Amazon.
[00:35:08.743 --> 00:35:11.406]  You can get it at Infowars.com as low as $9.95 apiece.
[00:35:11.586 --> 00:35:13.167]  I think on Amazon it's like $12.
[00:35:13.207 --> 00:35:16.931]  But you can get it as low as $9.95 at Infowars.com.
[00:35:17.472 --> 00:35:19.674]  I haven't even made my money back yet on this film.
[00:35:19.734 --> 00:35:20.234]  I don't care.
[00:35:20.374 --> 00:35:26.100]  It is the thrill, the pleasure of making a professional film with the information to fight the globalists.
[00:35:27.393 --> 00:35:28.073]  So support us!
[00:35:28.113 --> 00:35:29.894]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:29.914 --> 00:35:36.558]  Get America Freedom from Fascism, Loose Change, Second Edition, 9-11 Mysteries, Demolitions, so many other books and videos.
[00:35:36.598 --> 00:35:40.640]  The best stuff I've seen, the best books, the best videos, the best books on tape.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:46.023]  They're all available on the online video and bookstore shopping cart that is totally secure.
[00:35:46.383 --> 00:35:51.786]  That's InfoWars.com or you can simply call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:35:56.778 --> 00:36:01.099]  We've also added the best shortwave radios for the price that I have found.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.501]  They are just amazing.
[00:36:04.541 --> 00:36:07.782]  These Kato radios are basically Sanjean clones.
[00:36:08.262 --> 00:36:12.603]  We've tested them side-by-side and they're about 30 to 40% the price.
[00:36:12.623 --> 00:36:16.685]  30 or 40% off the price of a comparable Sanjean.
[00:36:17.885 --> 00:36:19.666]  So you can get a radio for $100.
[00:36:19.706 --> 00:36:21.346]  It's $150, $170, depending on where you get it.
[00:36:21.366 --> 00:36:22.227]  And we're selling them to move.
[00:36:27.725 --> 00:36:31.928]  We're on shortwave 11 to 2 back from 9 to midnight.
[00:36:32.328 --> 00:36:35.129]  There's a whole world of firing stations in English.
[00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.011]  It's just such an exciting thing.
[00:36:38.051 --> 00:36:43.554]  It blows satellite radio away because you just buy it and you don't have to pay for it anymore.
[00:36:46.495 --> 00:36:47.616]  It's very hard to cut off.
[00:36:48.832 --> 00:36:52.333]  And the show comes in, most days, like good AM radio.
[00:36:52.674 --> 00:37:00.276]  At night, it really comes in good, because we're on a powerful shortwave affiliate, WWCR, 11 to 2, and then back from 9 to midnight.
[00:37:00.717 --> 00:37:02.557]  And they gave me a report of the day.
[00:37:02.597 --> 00:37:05.238]  In the middle of the night, they're re-airing three hours of it, two for free.
[00:37:05.258 --> 00:37:09.560]  It's the only, really, broadcast info that we pay for.
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:16.863]  We do pay each month to have a world service, because it doesn't really generate any capital to help us fund the operation.
[00:37:18.032 --> 00:37:29.674]  We get letters from Africa, and Indonesia, and China, and calls from McMurdle Weather Station in Antarctica, and people listening in rural areas of Canada, and Montana, and Texas.
[00:37:31.855 --> 00:37:33.575]  And, you know, affiliates come and go.
[00:37:33.615 --> 00:37:37.256]  We'll have an affiliate about two years, and they usually sell or change formats.
[00:37:37.276 --> 00:37:37.856]  That happens.
[00:37:37.896 --> 00:37:38.696]  We gain new affiliates.
[00:37:39.116 --> 00:37:40.136]  But you just go get a shortwave.
[00:37:40.156 --> 00:37:44.737]  If you don't have a computer, or your computer ties you down, get a shortwave from us at InfoWars.com.
[00:37:46.235 --> 00:37:49.839]  We also have these little FM transmitters that come with a 4-volt plug.
[00:37:49.919 --> 00:37:56.327]  If you get a 6-volt plug at Radio Shack for like $10 and plug it in, it doubles the transmission power of these little FM transmitters.
[00:37:56.347 --> 00:38:01.433]  Then you add an antenna to that, and it can quadruple it, I'm told, by folks that have them and by the
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:02.280]  I don't
[00:38:18.602 --> 00:38:19.583]  We're good to go!
[00:38:40.862 --> 00:38:45.007]  I know folks that have these that can... I was saying 400 feet, I'm told.
[00:38:45.087 --> 00:38:45.868]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:38:46.329 --> 00:38:48.752]  Two, three, four city blocks in your car.
[00:38:49.373 --> 00:38:50.474]  So I'm done talking about it.
[00:38:50.494 --> 00:38:53.458]  They're available at Infowars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:38:58.507 --> 00:39:03.989]  Be sure and check out all the big discounts we have on InfoWars.com or you can call and they can tell you about the different discounts.
[00:39:04.029 --> 00:39:06.650]  We've got deals where my films are as low as $5.95 a piece.
[00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:10.171]  My first seven films are finally all now on DVD.
[00:39:10.511 --> 00:39:12.112]  We've been so busy we never converted them over.
[00:39:12.132 --> 00:39:15.973]  You can get all three of my police state films, three DVDs and a box set for $34.95.
[00:39:16.733 --> 00:39:19.554]  That's 45% off at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:19.874 --> 00:39:25.196]  Those are the kind of deals and every order gets a free pocket constitution, Bill of Rights, Citizen Rule Book.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.702]  Very useful information, where you can buy those at cost from us.
[00:39:30.243 --> 00:39:31.864]  Yes, we sell them to you at cost.
[00:39:32.224 --> 00:39:35.886]  We get them at cost, and then we have like 10% for handling.
[00:39:35.906 --> 00:39:40.269]  I don't think it even covers it for my employees to stick it in an envelope and send it to you.
[00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:42.171]  So we're selling these at cost.
[00:39:42.211 --> 00:39:43.131]  I don't know why I'm doing it.
[00:39:43.672 --> 00:39:47.194]  Frankly, I lowered the prices about a year ago, and it didn't increase sales, but I don't care.
[00:39:48.295 --> 00:39:48.875]  Whatever.
[00:39:49.215 --> 00:39:49.676]  Whatever.
[00:39:49.896 --> 00:39:50.676]  That's what I did.
[00:39:53.487 --> 00:40:11.398]  The reason I raise this is because your support, the caveat, the added addendum, the fringe benefit, is that you don't just get great materials to be more informed yourself and to make copies and give them to other people and make them more informed and save this country and this planet from tyranny, but you also help us fund our operations and what we're doing.
[00:40:13.126 --> 00:40:15.387]  Because so much of what we do is just pure outreach.
[00:40:15.407 --> 00:40:17.667]  And then of course there's PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:40:17.707 --> 00:40:26.029]  I want to thank all the members of PrisonPlanet.tv, all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other documentaries, my weekly TV reports, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.830]  It is only 15 cents a day.
[00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:31.871]  Check it out, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:37.732]  Alright, let me just try to cover this properly.
[00:40:41.724 --> 00:40:46.646]  Let me do my best to go over this.
[00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:58.670]  Again, sometimes I research something that I have so much knowledge on it that it's hard to even put it all out succinctly.
[00:41:01.191 --> 00:41:02.651]  Number one, let me just say this.
[00:41:02.912 --> 00:41:09.694]  I believe the guest we're going to have on in the next hour, David Hawkins, who is a
[00:41:11.229 --> 00:41:20.877]  Forensic Economist and Captain Field McConnell, a former Northwest Airlines pilot who resigned Monday, who took early retirement Monday.
[00:41:22.099 --> 00:41:24.260]  I believe that they believe in what they're saying.
[00:41:25.742 --> 00:41:27.623]  I don't know if they're right about everything.
[00:41:27.743 --> 00:41:30.005]  I certainly know they're right about some of what they're saying.
[00:41:30.526 --> 00:41:36.251]  This story has massive import to the 9-11 investigation and to the safety of the traveling public.
[00:41:39.053 --> 00:41:41.094]  And so let me just boil it down to what we know.
[00:41:42.594 --> 00:42:04.359]  Boeing indeed, as of the late 90s, had developed a microchip that was similar to chips in guided cruise missiles that could be implanted into the motherboard autopilot systems of Boeing aircraft.
[00:42:08.394 --> 00:42:19.463]  And they say that by satellite, the government or private security companies can remotely access the planes and that the pilots can do nothing.
[00:42:19.864 --> 00:42:23.346]  They can fly the plane with more precision than the pilots can.
[00:42:23.386 --> 00:42:32.514]  They've been doing tests, landing and taking off and flying thousands of miles with these aircraft from California to Australia, in Europe to Germany.
[00:42:35.236 --> 00:42:36.077]  We know that's true.
[00:42:36.884 --> 00:42:45.388]  And the headline, if we were going to write a story on this, should read, Could Boeing System Allow Hackers to Take Control of Aircraft?
[00:42:45.728 --> 00:42:46.828]  That's one angle.
[00:42:48.049 --> 00:43:00.994]  Two, why has Boeing been deceptive about this, and why won't the different pilots associations and others that have been asked to respond, if this has indeed been implanted in planes, why won't they respond?
[00:43:03.286 --> 00:43:14.849]  Why when we call Boeing do they just say this pilot's crazy and that it isn't true and then we go find massive news reports where they're telling their shareholders, where they're doing interviews, where Boeing's saying they have developed this.
[00:43:16.909 --> 00:43:25.911]  So the question is, has Boeing put an illegal, unauthorized, unapproved by the FAA
[00:43:28.891 --> 00:43:31.593]  Have they put an unapproved part in the aircraft?
[00:43:31.813 --> 00:43:32.653]  Then another question.
[00:43:33.333 --> 00:43:37.116]  Did the planes on 9-11 have this installed?
[00:43:39.997 --> 00:43:45.780]  Now, yesterday I got on air and I told the story for the umpteenth time that it was either the night of 9-11 or the day after.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:47.161]  I think it was September 12th.
[00:43:48.382 --> 00:43:51.644]  I'm watching television, watching it as it unfolds.
[00:43:51.864 --> 00:43:53.405]  I believe I was recording.
[00:43:53.425 --> 00:43:55.446]  I was recording on two TVs at my house at the time.
[00:43:55.806 --> 00:43:57.707]  I was broadcasting and obviously out of my house at the time.
[00:43:58.362 --> 00:44:03.445]  I don't know where it is.
[00:44:03.465 --> 00:44:08.847]  But I had said that I had seen George Bush giving a speech in what I remember to be New York.
[00:44:21.073 --> 00:44:25.535]  And he started saying, hey, don't worry, we've got a system we've already been testing of remote controlling planes.
[00:44:25.855 --> 00:44:27.576]  That way hijackers can hijack.
[00:44:28.136 --> 00:44:34.159]  And somebody behind him with dark hair reaches up and you can see him grabbing him by his sleeve.
[00:44:35.059 --> 00:44:38.961]  And you're seeing it from an angle and the guy's on the other side of Bush and kind of pulling on his coat.
[00:44:39.001 --> 00:44:41.302]  And Bush says, well, we'll talk about that more later.
[00:44:43.965 --> 00:44:55.967]  Well, listeners went around ferreting about and they indeed found a transcript from late September of Bush a few weeks later in Chicago in a hangar at O'Hare saying the exact same thing and not being stopped.
[00:44:56.667 --> 00:45:02.028]  But we have not found what I saw, I believe, September 12th.
[00:45:02.248 --> 00:45:03.049]  I've got to go look it up.
[00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.849]  When was he in New York?
[00:45:03.869 --> 00:45:05.869]  If he wasn't there on the 12th, then it was on the 11th.
[00:45:05.909 --> 00:45:08.810]  It was after he was on the pile and then he went and
[00:45:12.774 --> 00:45:13.674]  But again, that's just one point.
[00:45:13.694 --> 00:45:14.695]  I've got hundreds here, literally.
[00:45:14.735 --> 00:45:16.215]  Folks, I have a giant file on this now.
[00:45:17.375 --> 00:45:19.356]  And we have all those quotes, and we're putting it in an article.
[00:45:20.236 --> 00:45:21.957]  Paul's written an article that has part of the quote in it.
[00:45:27.158 --> 00:45:33.380]  In fact, here is President Bush, CNN Live event special, aired September 27, 2001, 1140 Eastern Time.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.440]  Okay, this is President Bush.
[00:45:40.715 --> 00:45:45.059]  And third, we will set aside $500 million in new funding for aircraft security.
[00:45:45.099 --> 00:45:48.442]  Grants will go to airliners for enhanced cockpit protection.
[00:45:48.682 --> 00:45:56.508]  We look forward to working with the pilots and airliners to fortify doors and provide stronger locks so our pilots will always be in command of the airplanes.
[00:45:56.568 --> 00:45:57.009]  Applause!
[00:45:57.589 --> 00:46:10.213]  We will invest in new technology for aircraft security with grants to develop transponders that cannot be switched off in the cockpit, video monitors in the cockpit to alert pilots in trouble in the cabin, and we look forward to all kinds of technologies to make sure our airlines are safe.
[00:46:10.473 --> 00:46:18.216]  For example, including technology to enable controllers to take control of a distressed aircraft and land it by remote control.
[00:46:22.532 --> 00:46:23.893]  Now when I saw him, he said it was a little different.
[00:46:23.913 --> 00:46:27.736]  He said, we've got systems and we've already developed them that will allow us to take control of the planes.
[00:46:28.056 --> 00:46:30.277]  So again, I guess he said this multiple times.
[00:46:31.018 --> 00:46:32.699]  But here it is, CNN transcript.
[00:46:32.719 --> 00:46:33.600]  We provided the links.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:34.901]  He did indeed say this.
[00:46:34.981 --> 00:46:35.281]  Okay?
[00:46:36.021 --> 00:46:36.462]  There it is.
[00:46:39.544 --> 00:46:45.028]  Now, the German newspaper Der Spiegel reported October 28, 2001
[00:46:49.744 --> 00:47:09.150]  And then we found another report here from several months before 9-11 where they reported the same thing and it says August 2001 German newspaper Der Spiegel later reports this month the US company Raytheon landed a 727 six times in a military base in New Mexico without any pilot on board.
[00:47:09.471 --> 00:47:16.773]  This was done to test equipment making future hijackings more difficult by allowing ground control to take over the flying
[00:47:17.293 --> 00:47:26.459]  I have a hijacked plane, Der Spiegel, 10-28-01, even though Der Spiegel got their information directly from Raytheon, most media reports for 9-11 suggest that technology is currently impossible.
[00:47:26.739 --> 00:47:31.962]  We have all those reports with the media and the government saying it's impossible, and calling us conspiracy theorists, and we say this exists.
[00:47:32.282 --> 00:47:33.083]  That's what's important.
[00:47:33.103 --> 00:47:37.405]  We need to go find all the reports where they denied this existed, and then show that.
[00:47:38.186 --> 00:47:41.728]  And I was telling my writers about this, because I remember reading them and seeing them, and they're like, well, we haven't seen those.
[00:47:41.888 --> 00:47:42.789]  Well, go find them!
[00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:44.510]  This is important, folks.
[00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:49.391]  For instance, frankly I did find them.
[00:47:49.451 --> 00:47:51.191]  I didn't know my printer was out of ink this morning.
[00:47:51.211 --> 00:47:52.312]  I went to get it and it wasn't there.
[00:47:52.952 --> 00:47:54.872]  So hours of research was down the toilet.
[00:47:55.993 --> 00:48:02.354]  Even though Dr. Spiegel got their information directly from Raytheon, most media reports of 9-11 suggest technology is currently impossible.
[00:48:02.675 --> 00:48:03.935]  For instance, the Observer quotes,
[00:48:05.117 --> 00:48:22.108]  An expert who says the technology is pretty much there, but still untried, Observer 9-1601, the New York Times, reports on Bush's speech in which he mentioned that the government would give grants for research for new technology, probably far in the future, allowing aircraft controllers to land distressed planes by remote control.
[00:48:23.348 --> 00:48:24.829]  New York Times, 9-2801.
[00:48:25.229 --> 00:48:30.353]  In the wrong hands, couldn't such technology have caused the 9-11 attacks without needing any hijackers on the planes?
[00:48:30.773 --> 00:48:31.353]  See 1998 and September
[00:48:33.211 --> 00:48:34.072]  Twenty-fifth, 2001.
[00:48:34.812 --> 00:48:38.575]  Vendor Spiegel, a forced landing system developed in the U.S.
[00:48:39.135 --> 00:48:41.117]  will make planes and hijacking more difficult.
[00:48:41.197 --> 00:48:46.961]  In case of emergency, the cruise operates a switch and a machine steers automatically to the next airport.
[00:48:48.742 --> 00:48:51.744]  And it goes on to say they were testing this before 9-11 in Germany.
[00:48:52.104 --> 00:48:55.847]  The times for an airplane kidnapper are becoming harder.
[00:48:56.787 --> 00:49:13.385]  In America, engineers are working to land kidnapped machines in the future by an improved autopilot without assistance of the cockpit, or the nearest airport, an emergency switch, where the ground control operates crew, the levers in the airplane are then blocked, and the kidnappers can no longer control the plane.
[00:49:13.405 --> 00:49:15.628]  This is how the Germans call hijackers, kidnappers.
[00:49:16.028 --> 00:49:17.510]  And the plane from the hand controls.
[00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:19.972]  According to recent news releases, technicians of U.S.
[00:49:20.032 --> 00:49:29.441]  Aviation and Army Company Raytheon already in August of 2001 landed a passenger aircraft six times successfully on a military airport in Holloman, New Mexico.
[00:49:30.302 --> 00:49:33.565]  The plane was equipped with a special force landing system without any pilots.
[00:49:33.905 --> 00:49:34.746]  The Boeing 727 oriented itself
[00:49:37.523 --> 00:49:52.047]  As usual, the radar signals at the end of the runway, but by the condition and combination of GPS satellite and ground signals, which help to exactly compute the altitude and thus to necessarily angle the approach with the deviation no greater than one meter.
[00:49:52.967 --> 00:49:53.447]  Three feet.
[00:49:54.587 --> 00:49:56.668]  Like a cruise missile, three feet accuracy.
[00:49:56.988 --> 00:49:58.268]  They can shoot them down chimneys.
[00:50:00.329 --> 00:50:03.990]  Folks, the stat goes on for just... It's five inches tall.
[00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:05.770]  I've just covered one millimeter of it.
[00:50:07.149 --> 00:50:10.732]  So, this is out of BFI Technologies, November 11, 1997.
[00:50:12.473 --> 00:50:21.200]  BFI, BEI, excuse me, Technologies, Inc., announces Boeing selection of gyro chip for 737 airplane.
[00:50:21.741 --> 00:50:25.784]  BEI Technologies, Inc., NASDAQ's BEIQ, announced that it's
[00:50:27.117 --> 00:50:38.187]  Microchip gyrochip sensor has selected by Honeywell and Boeing for use in a modernization modification of the rudder system of the current model Boeing 737 airplane.
[00:50:38.207 --> 00:50:50.497]  The solid-state quartz gyroscope is manufactured by Cistron Donner Internal Division, a division of BEI's principal subsidiary, and it goes on to say what it does.
[00:50:51.378 --> 00:50:52.599]  This is just incredible.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:53.900]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:54.381]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.001 --> 00:51:05.447]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:05.808 --> 00:51:13.456]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:14.153 --> 00:51:21.219]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:21.599 --> 00:51:33.028]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:36.831]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:37.292 --> 00:51:39.253]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:39.574 --> 00:51:43.417]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:10.564 --> 00:54:21.672]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[00:54:22.233 --> 00:54:24.594]  I live back in the woods, you see.
[00:54:25.155 --> 00:54:27.556]  A woman and the kids and the dogs and me.
[00:54:32.707 --> 00:54:38.375]  I got a shotgun, a rifle, and a four-wheel drive, and a country boy can survive.
[00:54:38.395 --> 00:54:44.504]  Country folks can survive.
[00:54:47.677 --> 00:54:50.418]  I can plow a field all day long.
[00:54:50.518 --> 00:54:54.940]  I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn.
[00:54:56.521 --> 00:55:01.703]  We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too.
[00:55:01.803 --> 00:55:07.225]  Ain't too many things these old boys can't do.
[00:55:07.265 --> 00:55:15.268]  We grow good old tomatoes and homemade wine and country boy can survive.
[00:55:23.299 --> 00:55:27.121]  Welcome back.
[00:55:27.841 --> 00:55:39.506]  Alright, I'm going to hold Kevin over to the next segment because I've got to cover all this basic data, then get our guest on.
[00:55:40.386 --> 00:55:46.689]  Because again, I get this airline pilot on, he's going, you don't know about the BATF, you don't know about how the fact they're not allowed to have those explosives in there.
[00:55:47.209 --> 00:55:49.550]  I'm telling you, and I'm just thinking, this sounds crazy.
[00:55:50.425 --> 00:55:51.706]  Then we're sent all this data.
[00:55:52.146 --> 00:55:54.048]  This is the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[00:55:54.388 --> 00:55:55.629]  We've got two separate articles.
[00:55:55.689 --> 00:55:57.190]  Boeing, of course, is based in Seattle.
[00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:57.950]  They're corporate offices.
[00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:00.472]  They've now moved their main manufacturing to Beijing.
[00:56:01.153 --> 00:56:02.734]  Kevin Smith himself is a pilot.
[00:56:03.614 --> 00:56:04.875]  His brother is a commercial pilot.
[00:56:04.895 --> 00:56:05.856]  That's why I've got Kevin in here.
[00:56:06.516 --> 00:56:07.797]  Kevin, we're reading over this.
[00:56:07.917 --> 00:56:10.079]  And again, we've got hundreds of pages of news articles here.
[00:56:10.888 --> 00:56:12.209]  It's like trying to eat an elephant here.
[00:56:12.369 --> 00:56:16.473]  We just found exactly what they were saying, separately from these guys telling us.
[00:56:16.973 --> 00:56:19.475]  And this is one of the heads of Boeing admitting.
[00:56:19.996 --> 00:56:22.378]  Kevin, tell us the date, the name of the headline.
[00:56:22.858 --> 00:56:24.379]  Kevin Smith, please give it to us.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.242]  You talk about being inundated with information.
[00:56:27.262 --> 00:56:30.384]  I guess I was chewing on the trunk and didn't see the tail on this one.
[00:56:30.425 --> 00:56:34.688]  But yeah, this is a transcript of a speech by Boeing's Doug Bain.
[00:56:35.108 --> 00:56:38.912]  And Doug is the Boeing Senior Vice President and General Counsel.
[00:56:39.652 --> 00:56:52.497]  And this was from a Boeing leadership meeting on January 5th of 2006 and most of it he's complaining to the other executives how they're being piled on in these lawsuits and these problems with the chips they supply to China illegally.
[00:56:53.017 --> 00:56:56.679]  But there's a part in here and a little later in the article it goes
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:03.683]  We can all get re-suspended or our IDS, Integrated Defense Systems, can be debarred.
[00:57:04.083 --> 00:57:05.824]  We can lose our security clearances.
[00:57:06.144 --> 00:57:24.996]  And one nasty little thing that the BATF, which has almost explicit prohibition on possessing explosives, for those of you here at BCA, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, you might remember that every single door on an airplane has actuators that are triggered by explosives.
[00:57:25.596 --> 00:57:27.417]  So why do I keep talking about this stuff?
[00:57:27.817 --> 00:57:31.778]  The simple answer is, if we're not careful, it can happen again.
[00:57:33.499 --> 00:57:34.199]  Boeing VP.
[00:57:34.659 --> 00:57:51.025]  Now, so we've got explosives, exactly, now notice the news tries to make this pilot who retired over this on Monday, a military veteran, they tried to make him sound nuts, but when he says there's bombs, no, what he told the newspaper is, they've got illegal explosives in the doors,
[00:57:52.472 --> 00:58:02.381]  And he believes because this is a remote control system controlling the whole plane, this is a system that's integrated in for total control of the aircraft, he's saying they can remotely detonate those doors.
[00:58:02.922 --> 00:58:04.203]  I think that's completely legitimate.
[00:58:04.603 --> 00:58:05.524]  I would think so, too.
[00:58:05.564 --> 00:58:10.308]  And they say, well, if the terrorists take over a plane, we won't let them fly to their intended target.
[00:58:10.328 --> 00:58:11.589]  We can just land them on the ground.
[00:58:12.532 --> 00:58:23.195]  You better hope that it's a benevolent person on the end of that remote control, and if we think back to Egypt Air 990 a few years before 9-11, that Boeing plane went nosedive straight into the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:58:23.235 --> 00:58:28.317]  They said the co-pilot overpowered the pilot and, you know, some sort of a jihad and flew straight into the water.
[00:58:28.757 --> 00:58:32.878]  Now that's the same controller that was controlling a couple of the flights on the 9-11, too.
[00:58:33.078 --> 00:58:33.699]  Yeah, stay there.
[00:58:33.739 --> 00:58:34.799]  Let's talk about this.
[00:58:36.963 --> 00:58:42.026]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:42.066 --> 00:58:42.546]  Big Brother.
[00:58:42.726 --> 00:58:43.607]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:43.627 --> 00:58:45.408]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:45.728 --> 00:58:49.490]  You want answers?
[00:58:49.831 --> 00:58:51.912]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:00.988 --> 00:59:04.949]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:05.189 --> 00:59:09.290]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:23.793]  All right, we've got an individual who's got many letters in front of his name, Cambridge graduate David Hawkins, who's been working with Captain Field McConnell, Northwest Airlines pilot who resigned Monday.
[00:59:25.925 --> 00:59:27.366]  He's coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:27.986 --> 00:59:29.648]  All of this was spurred by a headline.
[00:59:30.068 --> 00:59:33.630]  Northwest pilot from rural Glendon alleges 9-11 cover-up.
[00:59:34.811 --> 00:59:44.578]  The media tries to make it all sound crazy, but we went and dug out Boeing admitting that they have explosives on the plane that are illegal and not VATF authorized.
[00:59:46.019 --> 00:59:52.103]  And now there's a discussion of have they put these unauthorized gyro remote control chips in their aircraft?
[00:59:54.284 --> 00:59:55.585]  And so we'll be talking to him coming up
[00:59:56.704 --> 01:00:00.429]  In the next segment, we're also going to get Captain Phil McConnell on right now as well.
[01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:03.013]  He's finishing up an interview with an ABC News affiliate.
[01:00:04.095 --> 01:00:06.238]  Kevin Smith, you're a pilot in your own right.
[01:00:06.258 --> 01:00:07.600]  Again, your brother's a commercial pilot.
[01:00:08.641 --> 01:00:09.703]  Let's walk through this.
[01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:16.133]  I mean, this is massive what we discovered here in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[01:00:16.653 --> 01:00:21.435]  This is one of Boeing's chief engineers saying that we could get in trouble with the BATF.
[01:00:21.455 --> 01:00:28.079]  Then I found articles where they were indeed fined previously for selling the gyro chip to the Chinese.
[01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:30.600]  I've got this big stack here, Kevin.
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:31.340]  You've been doing research.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.941]  I've been doing research since yesterday.
[01:00:33.321 --> 01:00:37.183]  What do you think some of the other key areas... Well, recap that and let's cover one or two of the other key areas.
[01:00:38.024 --> 01:00:48.611]  Well, I mean, we can think about these stories that they say, oh, you can't bring on your liquids now, because you may go into the bathroom, set up a chemistry lab, and try to concoct some cocktail of explosives.
[01:00:49.432 --> 01:00:52.114]  You can't bring your shampoo on the plane, or your toothpaste.
[01:00:52.534 --> 01:00:55.516]  And the whole time, they've got the doors lined with explosives.
[01:00:55.856 --> 01:00:56.557]  And I think, well,
[01:00:57.177 --> 01:01:00.598]  Are these exploding bolts like they have on a spaceship hatch?
[01:01:00.618 --> 01:01:02.219]  That's what it is.
[01:01:02.419 --> 01:01:07.580]  Or is this like an ejection seat in an aircraft where you have to, you know, it becomes armed when you get ready to fly?
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.320]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:14.522]  The pilot, and we're going back on to having his own words, is saying, this is wired into this remote control.
[01:01:14.802 --> 01:01:17.843]  You can just blow the hatch when you're up in the air.
[01:01:18.063 --> 01:01:18.303]  Sure.
[01:01:18.603 --> 01:01:24.225]  You can depressurize, and then he claims that it's so anti-terror forces could raid aircraft on the ground.
[01:01:25.301 --> 01:01:26.402]  But look, there it is.
[01:01:26.523 --> 01:01:27.203]  Read that again.
[01:01:28.764 --> 01:01:35.891]  Again, this is the Vice President and Chief Counsel, or General Counsel at Boeing, a year ago, January 5th, 2006.
[01:01:36.812 --> 01:01:47.241]  He said, we can get re-suspended of all IDS, integrated defense systems, can be debarred, we can lose our security clearances, and a nasty little thing that the BATF
[01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:51.333]  Which is almost explicit prohibition on possessing explosives.
[01:01:51.673 --> 01:01:59.536]  And for those of you at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, you might remember that every single door on an airplane has actuators that are triggered by explosives.
[01:02:00.056 --> 01:02:01.737]  So why do we keep talking about this stuff?
[01:02:02.077 --> 01:02:05.478]  The simple answer is, if we're not careful, it can happen again.
[01:02:05.498 --> 01:02:08.980]  And we've read the article several times.
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:11.541]  In context, what is he talking about?
[01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:21.991]  Most of the article is he's complaining about how they're being dogpiled by the Feds for their transgressions and their dealings with the Chinese on giving sensitive information.
[01:02:22.011 --> 01:02:24.653]  And again, they were fined on the gyro chip with that.
[01:02:24.833 --> 01:02:27.194]  And now we see today in the news, China's going to the moon.
[01:02:27.234 --> 01:02:31.557]  And if you look what that QRS-11 chip allows, it's for that sort of thing.
[01:02:31.677 --> 01:02:34.298]  Missile guidance, airplane, remote control, spacecraft.
[01:02:35.399 --> 01:02:36.080]  The whole thing.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:41.687]  So, you know, and now it looks like our next guest, Mr. Hawkins, can talk about Iridium Satellite a little bit.
[01:02:41.767 --> 01:02:46.193]  Remember what, they built up this giant infrastructure and they just pulled the rug out from under it.
[01:02:46.473 --> 01:02:47.395]  And the government took it over.
[01:02:47.435 --> 01:02:48.656]  And the government took it over.
[01:02:48.676 --> 01:02:50.479]  That's the 66 satellites and 6 spares.
[01:02:51.119 --> 01:02:57.923]  And then we heralded him as a hero for saving his crew on that spy plane that landed in China.
[01:02:58.323 --> 01:03:00.004]  That's not what his job was a year ago.
[01:03:00.044 --> 01:03:01.825]  He should have put that spy plane in the ocean.
[01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:05.007]  He landed it, the Chinese went on board, took everything.
[01:03:05.687 --> 01:03:08.529]  And they also didn't pull the acid levers that take 10 seconds.
[01:03:09.679 --> 01:03:11.140]  We've seen a lot of technology transfer.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:11.860]  Let's be clear, folks.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.121]  They pull acid levers that burn out all the equipment.
[01:03:14.521 --> 01:03:15.621]  That was a staged event.
[01:03:15.741 --> 01:03:16.281]  Exactly.
[01:03:16.461 --> 01:03:21.903]  And I'm surprised they didn't make a movie about him, but I heard Hero Hero and I thought, no, that was treason.
[01:03:22.003 --> 01:03:23.864]  That's what, you know, like prime directive.
[01:03:24.124 --> 01:03:24.964]  First thing he should have done.
[01:03:24.984 --> 01:03:26.785]  Yeah, again, the default was pull the acid levers.
[01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:31.190]  You know, if I can save the crew, you know, on a second thought, good for me.
[01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:36.977]  But otherwise, I've got to do my first job, which is destroy all this data, information, software, everything.
[01:03:36.997 --> 01:03:38.879]  Well, bottom line, we know they've got these chips.
[01:03:38.919 --> 01:03:40.641]  We know that we're testing them before 9-11.
[01:03:40.862 --> 01:03:42.624]  We know Bush shot his mouth off about them.
[01:03:43.124 --> 01:03:46.128]  More and more of what this pilot and Mr. Hawkins is saying is coming out.
[01:03:46.168 --> 01:03:46.689]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:51.909 --> 01:03:57.378]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:57.738 --> 01:04:05.350]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:06.081 --> 01:04:13.144]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:13.524 --> 01:04:24.929]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:25.269 --> 01:04:28.911]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:29.211 --> 01:04:31.172]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:31.492 --> 01:04:35.334]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:49.511 --> 01:05:52.094]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:52.254 --> 01:05:54.416]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:05:54.697 --> 01:06:04.788]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[01:06:05.108 --> 01:06:07.490]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[01:06:39.887 --> 01:06:42.427]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:01.947 --> 01:07:06.870]  Captain Field McConnell, who joined us in the third hour yesterday, will be joining us in about five minutes.
[01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:12.214]  He's wrapping up an interview with ABC News, and then he has to get to an office to be able to speak with us.
[01:07:12.254 --> 01:07:15.256]  He was a Northwest Airlines pilot who resigned on Monday.
[01:07:15.896 --> 01:07:27.284]  Since mid-December, he's been going public about evidence that he had that there were remote control systems on some Boeing aircraft, including unauthorized explosive charges in the doors.
[01:07:27.864 --> 01:07:31.467]  We have now found a Seattle Post-Intelligencer article confirming that.
[01:07:32.355 --> 01:07:35.600]  Well, one of their chief engineers is talking about how much trouble they can get in for it.
[01:07:37.002 --> 01:07:38.885]  Why this is in a newspaper, I have no idea.
[01:07:38.925 --> 01:07:40.467]  I mean, this is out of control.
[01:07:40.928 --> 01:07:42.390]  This could end up being bigger than Building 7.
[01:07:45.554 --> 01:07:47.157]  But because it is
[01:07:49.441 --> 01:07:52.003]  Because it is complex, some people won't be able to understand it.
[01:07:52.063 --> 01:07:56.545]  So, I want to... Now, again, I look at things very suspiciously.
[01:07:56.565 --> 01:07:58.166]  I don't believe them right off the bat.
[01:07:58.186 --> 01:07:59.667]  I have to take time to digest.
[01:08:00.067 --> 01:08:02.989]  We already knew Boeing had developed chips for remote-controlled aircraft.
[01:08:03.209 --> 01:08:05.710]  We knew Bush had talked about how they developed it the day after 9-11.
[01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:10.613]  Then a few weeks later, we have those transcripts from CNN and the New York Times.
[01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:17.757]  We know that Boeing, years ago, before 9-11, had taken planes off from California and landed them in Australia.
[01:08:17.777 --> 01:08:18.798]  They'd done it in New Mexico.
[01:08:19.438 --> 01:08:23.905]  We already knew about all this, and we saw the media deny it, and it's crazy, and no one could remote control planes.
[01:08:24.406 --> 01:08:25.187]  We knew about it.
[01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:29.834]  The question is now, are these in the aircraft?
[01:08:31.098 --> 01:08:33.139]  Were companies involved doing this on 9-11?
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.640]  How would it be controlled?
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:38.362]  And bottom line, they're talking about now putting them on all the airplanes.
[01:08:39.363 --> 01:08:53.712]  Could hackers, could terrorists, let's say the government isn't involved, they're good people who care about us, and gee, they hate getting all the power they got off 9-11 and being our masters, and sure it helped them and they had the motive and the know-how and the capacity, but let's just say the government's innocent and wonderful and good, let's trust them.
[01:08:54.052 --> 01:08:57.174]  Well, could hackers get into these satellite systems and get control of the planes?
[01:08:57.454 --> 01:08:58.555]  Could they malfunction?
[01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:00.756]  Could someone accidentally trigger it?
[01:09:01.703 --> 01:09:03.685]  Because it shuts the pilot off from control.
[01:09:05.066 --> 01:09:06.647]  This is very, very dangerous.
[01:09:07.188 --> 01:09:19.257]  Going to our guest, David Hawkins, forensic economist, and his bio is five pages long, small print.
[01:09:19.918 --> 01:09:39.209]  Just in a nutshell, sir, tell us who you are, what your expertise is in, some of the things you've worked on, and then let's get into what this gyrochip is, how you learned of it from the backside of the command and control satellite system, and then walk through what this pilot's saying about explosives in the plane.
[01:09:39.249 --> 01:09:40.550]  But first off, thank you for joining us.
[01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:42.411]  And thank you very much, Alex.
[01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:45.333]  Yes, my background, I graduated from Cambridge University.
[01:09:45.393 --> 01:09:48.535]  I was awarded a scholarship in Applied Mathematics and Thermodynamics.
[01:09:49.804 --> 01:09:56.029]  International French oil field service company by the name of Schlumberger, which is extremely well known in the oil industry.
[01:09:56.770 --> 01:10:05.457]  And there I developed a lot of expertise in improvised explosive devices and handling of dangerous materials, including radioactive materials.
[01:10:06.618 --> 01:10:10.341]  I was a troubleshooter for the company and worked all around the world.
[01:10:10.701 --> 01:10:15.465]  I was the emergency response team leader for oil well blowouts for Schlumberger.
[01:10:16.033 --> 01:10:24.740]  And my last job with them in 1981 was Coordinator of Artificial Intelligence and Geoscience Research at the Research Center in Ridgefield in Connecticut.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.701]  Is that oil discovery systems?
[01:10:26.982 --> 01:10:28.002]  Yes, that's right, that's right.
[01:10:28.102 --> 01:10:43.434]  And although I didn't use the term then, what I actually developed and pioneered was the use of virtual prototyping as a kind of virtual war room for analyzing oil fields so that decentralized people all over the world could use internet-type tools.
[01:10:43.474 --> 01:10:45.676]  Back then it was more ARPANET and DARPANET.
[01:10:46.388 --> 01:10:49.151]  So basically this was the third or fourth wave of petroleum geology?
[01:11:09.848 --> 01:11:10.508]  Yes, that's right.
[01:11:10.588 --> 01:11:18.271]  I mean, Schlumberger actually was the pioneer of artificial intelligence developments in... I do that separately because I've had friends and family that have worked for Schlumberger.
[01:11:18.311 --> 01:11:20.111]  One of their big offices is north of Austin.
[01:11:20.832 --> 01:11:32.155]  Right, and I was a personal friend of the president of Schlumberger, Ewan Baird, who had a stroke in December in 2003 under very suspicious circumstances, but I'll come back to that.
[01:11:32.235 --> 01:11:37.957]  Anyway, the kind of contacts I made in Schlumberger and subsequently when I had my own company,
[01:11:39.198 --> 01:11:47.661]  I basically rebelled against the introduction of artificial intelligence technology that relied on computers making decisions.
[01:11:48.421 --> 01:11:59.845]  And although I couldn't have predicted it then, I wrote a paper about an analysis of expert thinking warning of the dangers of letting a computer, through a series of rules, fire some kind of decision.
[01:11:59.905 --> 01:12:03.486]  And fast forward to 2001 and what Boeing is doing now.
[01:12:03.947 --> 01:12:08.028]  What they're actually allowing, unbelievably, is to let a computer assess
[01:12:08.852 --> 01:12:12.673]  Whether or not the pilot should be allowed to retain control of his aircraft.
[01:12:14.434 --> 01:12:15.094]  Just think about that.
[01:12:15.774 --> 01:12:17.955]  Let's walk through the implications of that.
[01:12:19.015 --> 01:12:24.557]  Well, for example, Captain McConnell, and by the grace of God, I met this man by telephone.
[01:12:24.597 --> 01:12:27.577]  We'd never met face-to-face on the early in December.
[01:12:28.398 --> 01:12:33.319]  I'd been, in fact, I wrote a letter to the Boeing chairman on the 6th of June 2006, last year, warning him of this.
[01:12:36.730 --> 01:12:59.404]  I've had no reply, but what I desperately needed was to take the theories that I developed from a theoretical background and test them against someone who had experience both as a fighter pilot and a large passenger jet pilot and find out, for example, what could have flown in the way that the weapons platforms were flown on 9-11 and what couldn't have flown.
[01:12:59.884 --> 01:13:05.127]  You see, what these people are doing, it's very interesting, they're positioning us to debate what hit the Pentagon.
[01:13:05.945 --> 01:13:09.106]  But what we should be debating, for example, is what didn't hit the Pentagon.
[01:13:09.887 --> 01:13:26.093]  Now, what I and, I believe, Captain Phil McConnell both agree on now, and we can prove, it was physically impossible, from the laws of physics, for Captain Chick Birlingham, in the alleged flight A-77, to have executed the maneuvers of the weapon platform across the Pentagon.
[01:13:26.253 --> 01:13:28.454]  Who Captain McConnell also knew personally.
[01:13:29.715 --> 01:13:34.837]  Exactly right, because what happened is that machine, and it begs the question what it is,
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:42.744]  It executed a tight pivoted turn from 7,000 feet down to ground zero in two and a half minutes at 540 miles an hour.
[01:13:43.404 --> 01:13:55.211]  It literally hopped over the grassy knoll outside the Pentagon, leveled off at 10 feet elevation, and at 540 miles an hour it took out a major strategic asset, the U.S.
[01:13:55.271 --> 01:14:03.856]  Naval Command Center in the Pentagon, and what appears to be an electromagnetic pulse weapon, it fried the wire and wireless communication systems
[01:14:04.543 --> 01:14:07.484]  Isolating the President of the United States from U.S.
[01:14:07.544 --> 01:14:08.744]  Navy assets worldwide.
[01:14:10.124 --> 01:14:11.424]  That wasn't flown by a human being.
[01:14:12.484 --> 01:14:29.087]  Well, many pilots, we've interviewed many pilots who have said that the best jet pilots in the world with a passenger jet could not do that because simply you have that ground wave where you're trying to bring a plane in at that angulation and at that height that it would keep pushing the plane up.
[01:14:29.888 --> 01:14:32.088]  Yes, and it's called gust into trim.
[01:14:33.018 --> 01:14:40.185]  In Canada, and I think your listeners are going to be amazed at the role Canada, or at least Quebec, played in the 9-1-1 attack.
[01:14:40.845 --> 01:14:53.757]  What Canada was doing on 9-1-1 in a partnership with NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it had written a war game script with the defenders being NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense.
[01:14:53.897 --> 01:14:57.360]  And they'd already gone up on the DEFCON that day, that's admitted.
[01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.789]  That's correct.
[01:14:59.009 --> 01:15:18.253]  And this was after a dry run that they performed on the 1st of June, 2001, Alex, where they actually rehearsed a hijacking over Alaska, overflying British Columbia, turning south and then east towards the Washington, D.C., and taking out the Capitol building.
[01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:19.473]  And now that's all been admitted.
[01:15:19.493 --> 01:15:22.894]  They ran drills the year before, weeks before, and drills that day.
[01:15:23.667 --> 01:15:39.282]  That's right, and they stood down, the United States Air Force Base, to test the software technology developed by McDonnell Detweiler here in Richmond, British Columbia, and the machines that had apparently been modified by Cascade Aerospace at Abbotsford, British Columbia,
[01:15:39.947 --> 01:15:41.968]  With the gyrochip that we're talking about.
[01:15:42.488 --> 01:15:44.949]  Let's stop right there because this is all incredibly complex.
[01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:46.590]  I'll keep you guys in the next hour.
[01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:49.172]  We have Captain Field McConnell holding.
[01:15:49.192 --> 01:15:51.613]  I want him to stay right there so you can finish up with this.
[01:15:51.793 --> 01:15:53.153]  Just boil it down first.
[01:15:53.233 --> 01:15:53.874]  Make it simple.
[01:15:54.414 --> 01:15:55.234]  You know, your premise.
[01:15:55.334 --> 01:15:59.356]  And then let's walk through the evidence of that slowly.
[01:15:59.897 --> 01:16:06.600]  Bottom line, this particular gyrochip, what does it mean to you to have one of the chief
[01:16:07.376 --> 01:16:14.418]  engineers at Boeing saying we can get in trouble with the BATF for the explosives in the planes.
[01:16:14.778 --> 01:16:16.439]  Why would they make this public statement?
[01:16:16.539 --> 01:16:23.100]  And then do you believe that those systems had been put in some Boeing aircraft that were being used commercially?
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:26.081]  I mean, let's walk through the gyro chip first.
[01:16:27.101 --> 01:16:29.122]  All right, certainly, yes.
[01:16:29.202 --> 01:16:31.803]  Boeing had actually exported, I think from memory, 108
[01:16:33.878 --> 01:16:46.984]  Uh, gyrochip, illegally gyrochip modified Boeing 737s and I think 28 loose flight boxes, meaning that those flight boxes could presumably be installed on a 757 or a 767, to Communist China.
[01:16:47.444 --> 01:17:00.470]  Um, they had violated all the rules and regulations of the Department of Commerce, uh, but the responsibility at some time I think last year was transferred over to the Department of State, and the U.S.
[01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:01.450]  Department of Justice
[01:17:01.969 --> 01:17:03.310]  So we need a new investigation.
[01:17:28.724 --> 01:17:49.329]  Absolutely, and that's what I hope we're doing with Captain McConnell through his lawsuit in Fargo, Dakota, which starts with a claim for early retirement, which I believe that Captain McConnell was forced to do because he couldn't, as a fiduciary, discharge his responsibilities to his passengers or his crew when Boeing is admitted.
[01:17:49.769 --> 01:17:51.810]  It's modified a number of planes with a
[01:17:52.563 --> 01:17:56.526]  The missile gyroscope that allows it to be flown remotely by hostiles.
[01:17:56.726 --> 01:18:05.674]  You see, for example, the assumption lying behind this is that the air traffic controllers on 9-1-1 were on the blue team defense side for the war games.
[01:18:06.214 --> 01:18:19.465]  I think we can prove that the people flying that plane remotely on 9-1-1, or the four planes, were actually working with a mobbed-up union, the Laborers' Union, which dropped a draft RICO complaint in 1995.
[01:18:22.765 --> 01:18:24.686]  Well, this just gets more and more complex.
[01:18:24.726 --> 01:18:31.329]  What we know is Boeing's admitting there are explosive charges in the doors they can get in trouble for.
[01:18:32.670 --> 01:18:35.191]  And we know this gyro chip is real.
[01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:36.571]  We know they were fined for it.
[01:18:38.372 --> 01:18:40.933]  We know humans couldn't execute those maneuvers.
[01:18:42.454 --> 01:18:46.456]  We'll try to hash it all out, flesh it out, on the other side.
[01:18:49.062 --> 01:18:53.663]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:18:53.863 --> 01:18:58.304]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:12.508]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey Light Water Purifier, an LED Base, two Berkey Sport Filtration Bottles, the Berkey Battery Adapter, the Berkey MP Solar Charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:19:12.728 --> 01:19:35.755]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications, yet the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[01:19:35.915 --> 01:19:38.596]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.

[01:19:42.937 --> 01:19:44.178]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:44.218 --> 01:19:44.878]  Currency devaluation.
[01:19:44.918 --> 01:19:45.198]  Inflation.
[01:19:45.258 --> 01:19:45.798]  One and the same.
[01:19:45.818 --> 01:19:55.101]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:08.553 --> 01:20:11.674]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:20:11.934 --> 01:20:13.775]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:20:13.855 --> 01:20:16.856]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:20:17.396 --> 01:20:19.617]  Here is reality.
[01:20:19.997 --> 01:20:23.579]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:20:24.059 --> 01:20:27.720]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:20:28.281 --> 01:20:30.801]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[01:20:48.499 --> 01:20:57.149]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[01:20:57.930 --> 01:21:02.896]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[01:21:03.636 --> 01:21:09.625]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and then World War I and World War II?
[01:21:10.326 --> 01:21:18.739]  The Illuminati, who are worshippers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict, the Third World War, to produce their One World Government.
[01:21:19.497 --> 01:21:27.144]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming about by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:48.045]  It's a fact.
[01:21:48.225 --> 01:21:52.651]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:21:52.971 --> 01:21:58.175]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:01.677]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[01:22:01.938 --> 01:22:09.063]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:22:09.403 --> 01:22:16.588]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:22:16.828 --> 01:22:18.890]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[01:22:19.330 --> 01:22:25.653]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[01:22:25.893 --> 01:22:29.695]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.

[01:22:34.757 --> 01:22:36.158]  That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert.
[01:22:36.218 --> 01:22:39.520]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:22:49.446 --> 01:22:52.189]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:52.209 --> 01:22:56.112]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:58.714 --> 01:22:59.115]  All right.
[01:23:01.597 --> 01:23:04.139]  Co-piloting with us today is Captain Field McConnell.
[01:23:04.159 --> 01:23:05.180]  He's waiting in the wings.
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:07.382]  We're continuing with David Hawkins as a short segment.
[01:23:07.622 --> 01:23:09.604]  We're going to bring both gentlemen up in the next segment.
[01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:14.492]  David Hawkins, again, has more letters behind his name than a dictionary.
[01:23:14.512 --> 01:23:24.299]  You can read his bio up on InfoWars.com or at HawksCafe.com, bio, Hawks, with an S, Cafe, and that's up on InfoWars.com as well.
[01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:35.508]  The bottom line here is, they're talking about 2010, half the Air Force fleet being remote-controlled drone, to begin with, even larger aircraft with personnel on board.
[01:23:37.338 --> 01:23:43.876]  They're openly discussing in major mainstream publications about installing this on all Boeing aircraft to quote stop terrorists.
[01:23:45.149 --> 01:24:06.508]  But what is to stop elements in the government or private corporations or hackers or anyone else getting into these satellite systems and taking control, commandeering, or what is to stop a malfunction or a lever or a malfunction in the computer system and the pilot just being locked out of the system until it runs out of gas and crashes in 5,000 miles?
[01:24:07.028 --> 01:24:08.630]  There are so many facets to that.
[01:24:10.339 --> 01:24:21.905]  Then as AI technology develops and doubles every year now, we could then, this isn't science fiction folks, have a malfunctioning computer, a crazy computer, whatever you want to call it, deciding to take over.
[01:24:23.085 --> 01:24:25.847]  We do not need our strategic bomber fleet remote controlled.
[01:24:26.187 --> 01:24:32.910]  This allows very small groups to cut out the human equation and really create perfect dictatorships.
[01:24:33.691 --> 01:24:39.254]  They're now going to have grown tanks, they're now developing and deploying swords, ground
[01:24:40.894 --> 01:24:43.317]  This goes in a thousand different directions, doesn't it, David?
[01:24:44.379 --> 01:24:57.616]  Absolutely, and the unimaginable stupidity of this is that the Iridium satellite communication system which controls this was developed by Motorola shareholders at a cost of about five billion dollars, and around 2000
[01:24:59.964 --> 01:25:26.029]  Motorola was sued by JP Morgan directors under some pretext that they'd violated a loan covenant and that asset of five billion dollars was maneuvered into chapter 11 through the liquidator and bought the other side by what's called a private equity group, Alex, and my research indicates that that private equity group included as a private investment
[01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:32.846]  Interest related to the families of Yezlan Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.
[01:25:32.886 --> 01:25:35.868]  Now, let's go back to when you first started looking at this in 2000.
[01:25:35.908 --> 01:25:39.311]  This is the command and control, not the chips themselves.
[01:25:39.351 --> 01:25:40.632]  This is the command system.
[01:25:40.892 --> 01:25:42.674]  How you first discovered this, walk through it.
[01:25:43.435 --> 01:25:48.859]  Okay, back in 2000, I had been looking at a company in British Columbia that specialized
[01:25:49.429 --> 01:25:58.232]  In command and control for the American and British and Australian Armed Forces, this company called McDonnell Debt Rider and Associates.
[01:25:59.012 --> 01:26:08.455]  And on the 23rd of December 1999, this company fell into the hands of a private equity group related to Carlisle, Canada.
[01:26:09.065 --> 01:26:14.548]  That's Frank Carlucci, Jim Baker, and a couple of Canadians that we can count to.
[01:26:14.748 --> 01:26:18.650]  And that's a subgroup publicly owned by the Queen of England, the Bin Ladens, the Bushes, and others.
[01:26:19.290 --> 01:26:19.590]  Correct.
[01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:20.190]  Correct.
[01:26:21.151 --> 01:26:28.634]  In which Yezlan Bin Laden, the half-brother to Osama Bin Laden, became an investor in 1995.
[01:26:28.734 --> 01:26:35.978]  So, effectively, the Bin Laden family and the family of Saddam Hussein, through his half-brother in Geneva,
[01:26:36.636 --> 01:26:38.698]  Who was actually recently hanged in Baghdad.
[01:26:38.738 --> 01:26:40.439]  They used too long a rope and pulled his head off.
[01:26:41.059 --> 01:26:55.210]  But these people were actually investing through Carlisle in the command and control system company of McDonald Debt Rider here in British Columbia that provided command and control services for the 9-1-1 war games.
[01:26:56.951 --> 01:26:57.852]  Evidence is on that.
[01:26:59.124 --> 01:27:00.224]  The evidence is all over it.
[01:27:00.264 --> 01:27:09.707]  Just go to the Macdonald-Deppweiler website, you'll see from their press releases that they were acquired by CAI Private Equity Group in 23rd of December 1999.
[01:27:11.267 --> 01:27:17.549]  Then a series of very militant unions, including the British Columbia Investment Management Union, they got into that company as well.
[01:27:18.009 --> 01:27:27.511]  And effectively you created a left-wing support group for command and control infiltration of the American-Canadian war games.
[01:27:29.867 --> 01:27:33.088]  Right, so on the 9-11... Explain what you mean by left-wing infiltration.
[01:27:34.348 --> 01:27:46.751]  The Labour Union's one-third of Macdonald Debt Violus shares on 9-11 were owned by the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, which is the public service union here in British Columbia.
[01:27:46.791 --> 01:27:55.793]  The other third was owned by the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, and the other third, with the controlling shareholders, was this Carlisle Canada private equity group.
[01:27:56.727 --> 01:28:02.050]  Now, you also told me during a break that there's connections to some of these companies and insider trading on 9-11.
[01:28:03.091 --> 01:28:03.711]  Yes, totally.
[01:28:03.851 --> 01:28:25.463]  On 9-11, a major bank, the world's largest private bank, UBS, together with Carlyle Canada, they were long in New York and short in Chicago, meaning they had lots of shares like Enron, Dinergy, Quest, Worldcom and Tyco, that they knew if the shares were panicked, if the stock market was panicked, they could make money by shorting them in Chicago.
[01:28:26.549 --> 01:28:37.760]  So 1.2 trillion dollars of American wealth was transferred literally from New York to Chicago and laundered through the UBS bank back into these union pension funds and said, I have a say.
[01:28:39.001 --> 01:28:42.023]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:42.924 --> 01:28:45.627]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:49.798 --> 01:28:52.220]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:56.043]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:28:56.423 --> 01:28:59.366]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:28:59.646 --> 01:29:06.011]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:10.495]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:29:10.715 --> 01:29:15.077]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:29:15.237 --> 01:29:17.858]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:29:17.878 --> 01:29:20.639]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:29:21.099 --> 01:29:23.640]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:27.942]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:29:28.002 --> 01:29:28.822]  Treasury bonds.

[01:30:23.126 --> 01:30:23.426]  I'm good.
[01:30:48.576 --> 01:30:49.056]  Hey, Emily.
[01:30:49.417 --> 01:30:50.177]  Wow, you look great.
[01:30:50.477 --> 01:30:51.218]  I feel great.
[01:30:51.678 --> 01:30:53.299]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:54.140]  Really?
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:54.841]  What is it?
[01:30:55.001 --> 01:30:55.441]  How does it work?
[01:30:55.721 --> 01:31:02.006]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[01:31:02.326 --> 01:31:04.387]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:31:04.788 --> 01:31:10.251]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:31:10.492 --> 01:31:10.872]  That's it?
[01:31:11.272 --> 01:31:12.773]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:31:13.114 --> 01:31:13.774]  It is easy.
[01:31:14.214 --> 01:31:20.520]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:22.121]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:31:22.541 --> 01:31:23.202]  That's amazing!
[01:31:23.562 --> 01:31:28.406]  And, the bentonite clay and medicalins eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:31:28.826 --> 01:31:29.126]  Wow!
[01:31:29.406 --> 01:31:30.407]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[01:31:30.647 --> 01:31:33.427]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:37.129]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.

[01:31:39.309 --> 01:31:39.669]  Or call 1-800-317-9547.
[01:31:39.689 --> 01:31:39.889]  That's 800-317-9547.
[01:31:59.276 --> 01:32:05.320]  I was talking to our guest, David Hawkins, forensic economist, researcher during the break.
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:08.742]  And I was saying, are you saying Saddam is involved?
[01:32:08.762 --> 01:32:10.923]  And he said, well, he's absolutely involved on the financial side.
[01:32:10.943 --> 01:32:21.310]  And that sounds crazy to some people, but if you look at BCCI and much of the former Bush administration, James Baker, Clark Clifford, and many others,
[01:32:22.902 --> 01:32:38.091]  It was a multi-trillion dollar money laundering, drug dealing, chemical weapons, biological weapons, conventional weapons, radiological weapons warehouse, and Saddam did launder much of his proceeds through that.
[01:32:38.691 --> 01:32:45.455]  There was some type of falling out in 1990 between Saddam Hussein and the Bushes.
[01:32:45.775 --> 01:32:51.819]  And it is a mainstream fact that you have the Queen of England, the Bin Laden family, the Bushes, James Baker,
[01:32:53.218 --> 01:32:57.380]  People like the former Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, all in this company.
[01:32:58.201 --> 01:33:03.964]  And it's just involving everything from movie theaters, to radio networks, to weapons.
[01:33:04.124 --> 01:33:07.486]  It's just absolutely, it is mafia.
[01:33:08.266 --> 01:33:13.929]  And we're about to go to Captain Phil McConnell to get his take on all this.
[01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:16.911]  Specifically on explosive bolts in the doors.
[01:33:17.411 --> 01:33:22.414]  Specifically on this remote control gyro chip.
[01:33:23.650 --> 01:33:46.287]  And I have technical questions for both of you, but let me take you now, if we can, David Hawkins, to this Seattle Post-Intelligencer article that came out, headline, Transcript of Speech by Boeing's Doug Bain, January 5, 2006 in Orlando, Florida.
[01:33:46.767 --> 01:33:52.452]  And I'm sure you've seen this, where he says, we can get re-suspended or all of our IDSs
[01:33:53.374 --> 01:33:55.597]  Integrated defense systems can be debarred.
[01:33:56.037 --> 01:33:57.899]  We can lose our security clearances.
[01:33:58.019 --> 01:34:04.527]  And one nasty little thing is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which is an almost explicit prohibition on possessing explosives.
[01:34:04.907 --> 01:34:13.196]  For those of you who are a BCA, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, you might remember that every single door on an airplane has actuators that are triggered by explosives.
[01:34:14.196 --> 01:34:16.918]  So, why do we keep talking about this stuff?
[01:34:16.938 --> 01:34:19.359]  The simple answer is, if we're not careful, it can happen again.
[01:34:19.799 --> 01:34:27.123]  And that's talking about the huge $600-something million dollar fine that you were discussing earlier.
[01:34:27.143 --> 01:34:31.526]  So just in layman's terms, what on earth are they talking about?
[01:34:33.153 --> 01:34:34.114]  We're good to go.
[01:34:49.071 --> 01:35:02.306]  How many, or do we have a ballpark idea, how many Boeing aircraft and what types have been retrofitted or now new aircraft have been built at the Chinese plants with these systems that were transferred that they got fined for, Boeing did a few years ago?
[01:35:03.287 --> 01:35:05.749]  Well, we don't have an idea on the upper end of this.
[01:35:05.829 --> 01:35:08.833]  We do know that the very minimum, and that's only the
[01:35:09.583 --> 01:35:21.365]  planes that were exported by Boeing to China around a hundred planes contained the illegal modification and then they sent 28 flight boxes to China with the illegal modification.
[01:35:21.405 --> 01:35:25.426]  Now those flight boxes can be installed presumably in any Boeing of any model.
[01:35:25.546 --> 01:35:26.186]  Now that's a key!
[01:35:26.366 --> 01:35:35.088]  So we've got a hundred plus, plus twenty plus separate boxes or over a hundred and fifty aircraft that could be retrofitted over a hundred and twenty that you know that were.
[01:35:35.388 --> 01:35:35.948]  They were
[01:35:37.305 --> 01:35:43.310]  Why would they put that in planes in China, which are then exported around the world?
[01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:44.852]  Do we know where those planes went?
[01:35:46.093 --> 01:36:02.226]  Well, I think they did it because back in 1997, Clinton's Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, John Shalekashvili, went to the People's Liberation Army University in Beijing, and his closing words, and I'm quoting from memory, is,
[01:36:02.833 --> 01:36:08.537]  Before I leave here, I will give you details of all America's weapons programs.
[01:36:10.538 --> 01:36:22.666]  Now, I believe when he came back, he should have been taken in as a traitor, but the fact remains is, by 1997, all of your weapons programs, technologies, had been transferred to Communist China.
[01:36:24.547 --> 01:36:27.869]  And this objective was, I believe, to set the Chinese up.
[01:36:28.597 --> 01:36:37.447]  As a counterweight to what was seen by the Clintons and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as American imperialism.
[01:36:38.808 --> 01:36:50.941]  Well, in reality, that's the globalists wanting a fake bipolar world to have continual arms races on both sides, with each power block funding regional crises to continue the profit margin.
[01:36:51.936 --> 01:36:52.737]  You're absolutely right.
[01:36:52.777 --> 01:37:11.907]  Now, just on this gyroscope issue, what I've done is I've pulled up this article that Pilots' Lawsuit Alleges Airliners Rigged With Explosives, and just coming down, there's this wonderful diagram from the London Daily Mail, one, two, three, four steps, and I was listening to your interview with Phil McConnell yesterday, and you went through those steps.
[01:37:12.468 --> 01:37:18.191]  And step one is, the tamper-proof autopilot system can be activated by the captain or crew during a hijack.
[01:37:18.777 --> 01:37:22.078]  It can also be triggered by sensors if the cockpit door is forced.
[01:37:22.558 --> 01:37:26.659]  Now this technology they were testing during the war games of 9-1-1.
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:39.263]  The idea being that they were testing whether or not the American blue team defenders could take control of a physically hijacked plane electronically and land it safely.
[01:37:39.463 --> 01:37:48.466]  The assumption that the Americans were making during these war games was that the Canadian red team attackers, it was an Al-Qaeda simulated attack,
[01:37:49.153 --> 01:37:53.454]  We're actually not going to proceed from a simulated attack to a real one.
[01:37:54.694 --> 01:38:15.918]  But of course they left themselves wide open from a counterintelligence point of view because they weren't paying attention to the ground controllers who actually had control of those simulated hijackings on 9-1-1 and it is my allegation and Phil McConnell's allegation that those ground controllers included agents for the Al-Qaeda Red Team.
[01:38:16.542 --> 01:38:26.208]  Now we also have clips, now they've released from the different NORAD and FAA, where they're saying, I've never seen so much real world during an exercise.
[01:38:26.508 --> 01:38:27.729]  Is this part of the exercise?
[01:38:27.769 --> 01:38:29.030]  Is this part of the exercise?
[01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:33.853]  Yes, it's what I call a Trojan, an Al-Qaeda Trojan horse.
[01:38:33.913 --> 01:38:37.355]  They had set up a simulated training exercise.
[01:38:37.415 --> 01:38:44.340]  They'd taken some modified Boeing commercial aircraft and painted them in United or American Airlines colors.
[01:38:45.037 --> 01:38:48.380]  They were flying as what I call decoys.
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:39:01.670]  Now they admit there were over 24 aircraft in the air taking part in drills and quote other targets Sears Tower, the Travelers building in San Francisco, the CIA building, the Capitol, other key landmarks.
[01:39:02.671 --> 01:39:10.457]  That's right and what the red team, the Canadian red team, was doing they were monitoring the blue team's communication because they had through
[01:39:11.044 --> 01:39:19.787]  The test of the CIA database by John Deutch in 1995, they'd built a backdoor into America's counterintelligence.
[01:39:19.807 --> 01:39:21.648]  Well, they'd already merged the two drills.
[01:39:21.688 --> 01:39:25.629]  We do NORTHCOM, even before it was officially announced, integration of the systems.
[01:39:26.389 --> 01:39:26.730]  Correct.
[01:39:26.770 --> 01:39:33.352]  So they, the company that had developed the script for the war games is a company in Ottawa called Lansdowne Technologies.
[01:39:34.054 --> 01:39:46.620]  What Lansdowne Technologies was doing was developing, each time a war game took place, a more and more elaborate red team attack to see if they could bypass the blue team defenses, the American defenses.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:54.064]  What, of course, they learned from that were where the weaknesses were in the blue team and under what circumstances they could actually be tricked into standing down.
[01:39:54.930 --> 01:39:55.791]  Which they were tricked.
[01:39:56.291 --> 01:39:57.431]  Now let's be clear here though.
[01:39:57.872 --> 01:40:04.015]  Yes, we have the evidence that Saddam's a shareholder in one of these subsidiaries, but clearly it has to have the U.S.
[01:40:04.055 --> 01:40:07.437]  government being involved, different companies being involved.
[01:40:07.477 --> 01:40:11.499]  I mean, certainly, who from the evidence you have inside the federal government was involved?
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:20.544]  Well, I think there were rogue elements of the CIA, and this goes back to in 1995, there was the most extraordinary circumstance.
[01:40:21.621 --> 01:40:32.804]  Clinton appointed director of the CIA, Professor John Deutsch at MIT, and incidentally he's a professor in molecular thermodynamics, which is my area of expertise, so we can come to that in a minute.
[01:40:33.364 --> 01:40:43.367]  He took 17,000 pages of top secret CIA information and put it onto his home computer and transferred it to what we believe are hostiles.
[01:40:44.033 --> 01:40:58.884]  Now that 17,000 pages appear to have, and this is a government report, appears to have the identities and special weapons and training of all CIA operatives in the Middle East, including Osama Bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.
[01:41:00.765 --> 01:41:03.327]  So that makes it... Oh yeah, who are operatives.
[01:41:03.767 --> 01:41:04.788]  What document is that?
[01:41:04.808 --> 01:41:08.110]  Um, if you just Google for 17,000 pages John Deutch, um,
[01:41:11.124 --> 01:41:12.725]  C.I.A.
[01:41:13.065 --> 01:41:14.105]  I remember the scandal.
[01:41:14.785 --> 01:41:23.469]  Right, now this man basically works with a group at MIT, and we can count on him, and he steals the C.I.A.
[01:41:23.509 --> 01:41:32.753]  database, or a copy of the database, that describes and identifies the list of all the agents, and yet the name of that database is Al-Qaeda.
[01:41:33.813 --> 01:41:38.915]  And that's why they keep calling it Al-Qaeda, and that's been confirmed mainstream news, but it's just the name of a database.
[01:41:39.753 --> 01:41:40.133]  Exactly.
[01:41:40.233 --> 01:41:41.414]  It's an artifact.
[01:41:41.434 --> 01:41:56.620]  So what they've done is they've created special weapons and tactics teams from the identities that were stored on the stolen database, and they've orchestrated attack from this basically fictitious group, and they're blaming it.
[01:41:57.221 --> 01:42:06.425]  But unfortunately, sitting behind that, of course, is the Carlisle Canada investors who had a huge hedge fund position on the stock market through 9-1-1.
[01:42:08.579 --> 01:42:27.710]  Now, Buzzy Krongar did come out in the major German and British papers as the company he formerly headed, Alex and Brown, and it turned out that one of the top assistant directors, that's what he was, at Central Intelligence Agency was involved in insider trading, but that came out to be billions.
[01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:28.990]  How do you say it's trillions?
[01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.711]  Was that leveraged?
[01:42:30.491 --> 01:42:41.857]  Yes, the loss of value, capitalization of the stock market, predominantly in New York, through the four days closure of the trading floor... Transferred to the Chicago Margantile?
[01:42:42.457 --> 01:42:43.858]  Well, that was $1.2 trillion.
[01:42:44.058 --> 01:42:55.104]  Alright, so if you're short in the market, when the market for the longs goes down by $1.2 trillion, if you're short in Chicago, you can pick up a profit of $1.2 trillion.
[01:42:58.377 --> 01:42:59.017]  Unbelievable.
[01:43:00.098 --> 01:43:03.240]  Now, I want to go to Field McConnell.
[01:43:05.641 --> 01:43:07.542]  Field, do you have anything to add?
[01:43:07.602 --> 01:43:10.724]  Again, former Northwest Airlines pilot resigned on Monday.
[01:43:11.738 --> 01:43:12.359]  We're good to go.
[01:43:34.251 --> 01:43:39.833]  What, from your research, what areas, and this is for both of you, what areas of the aircraft can this control?
[01:43:39.893 --> 01:43:43.114]  Is it just the flight, or can it control the blowing of the doors?
[01:43:43.595 --> 01:43:54.098]  And then I want to ask David Hawkins how he gets this idea that they could also plant explosives during insulation re-do's.
[01:43:54.759 --> 01:43:58.200]  Okay, as far as the QRS-11 gyro chip, and QRS stands for
[01:43:59.025 --> 01:44:04.509]  Quartz Rate Sensor N11 is probably just the nominal number of the device.
[01:44:04.829 --> 01:44:16.158]  That's hardware that when installed in a triaxial, meaning roll, pitch, and all, y'all, you'd get all three axes of rotation under the control of the flight guidance system of these airplanes.
[01:44:16.779 --> 01:44:25.025]  And the thing that troubles me about the QRF11 gyro chip that was built by BEI Industries in Arkansas,
[01:44:26.283 --> 01:44:38.850]  is that it's military hardware and I've flown military and I've flown commercial airplanes but the commercial airplanes don't go fast enough to need that piece of hardware.
[01:44:38.890 --> 01:44:53.597]  That piece of hardware was developed by Raytheon Corporation and one of its uses is in Maverick missiles and there's many different types of missiles but the missiles I used to fly which were the AIM-9 Sidewinder and the AIM-7 Sparrows
[01:44:54.242 --> 01:44:54.723]  of course.
[01:45:14.258 --> 01:45:25.162]  Well, the point is, why do you have a chip that's illegal, that hasn't been authorized by the FAA to be an aircraft being installed, not just taken to China, but installed in aircraft?
[01:45:25.622 --> 01:45:28.123]  Yeah, well, there is no good reason, I assert.
[01:45:28.403 --> 01:45:31.044]  And I want you to know that I'm not a gunslinger.
[01:45:31.504 --> 01:45:37.467]  I've given ALPA and Boeing and the FBI, in fact, every opportunity to tell me where I'm wrong.
[01:45:38.968 --> 01:45:54.421]  in bringing this suggestion that Boeing aircraft should not have these military gyrochips in them and my first call on that was I contacted a military organization, NORTHCOM, which is also referred to as NORAD.
[01:45:54.822 --> 01:45:56.683]  I contacted them on 8 December.
[01:45:57.404 --> 01:45:58.905]  Here it is, March 7th.
[01:45:59.005 --> 01:45:59.666]  I've heard nothing.
[01:45:59.866 --> 01:46:01.748]  Yeah, that's up in Colorado Springs.
[01:46:01.768 --> 01:46:02.748]  That's the real government.
[01:46:03.309 --> 01:46:04.390]  Well, I mean, my point is
[01:46:05.590 --> 01:46:08.051]  Are these currently in those planes that were in China?
[01:46:08.111 --> 01:46:09.591]  Has there been an investigation?
[01:46:09.811 --> 01:46:11.632]  They were fined for the original transfer.
[01:46:11.652 --> 01:46:12.832]  Do they say they removed them?
[01:46:13.072 --> 01:46:17.274]  And then why do they deny to the press that they've ever put these in aircraft when it's hiding in plain view?
[01:46:17.594 --> 01:46:25.096]  Well, not only that, but they're talking out of both sides of their mouth because they're telling me through the press that I must be troubled or crazy.
[01:46:25.737 --> 01:46:28.297]  However, they installed them in the time frame 2000 to 2003.
[01:46:28.337 --> 01:46:28.858]  In 2006, they paid a $615,000
[01:46:33.795 --> 01:46:36.197]  Earlier you mentioned 607.
[01:46:36.237 --> 01:46:41.700]  It's actually a $615 million fine, the largest corporate fine in history, I believe.
[01:46:43.041 --> 01:46:48.424]  Nobody yet has contacted me, and I have no standing more than a fourth grader in New York City school.
[01:46:48.964 --> 01:46:57.549]  However, I've raised the question in a legitimate chain of command where I have legitimate standing, and I've been raising this question for three months now.
[01:46:58.937 --> 01:47:00.498]  And nobody has answered the question.
[01:47:00.518 --> 01:47:01.338]  Let me ask this question.
[01:47:01.398 --> 01:47:08.420]  When they got fined last year, was there an order to remove the gyro chips or are they still there?
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:23.444]  I believe they're still there because on the 1st of January of 07, Adam Air Flight 574, which is a upstart airline over in Indonesia, it was vaporized consistent with the threat that I brought for these four agencies on December 9th, 06.
[01:47:24.705 --> 01:47:25.585]  What was vaporized?
[01:47:26.047 --> 01:47:31.814]  A Boeing 737 that was being operated by Adam Air, which is an upstart airline in Indonesia.
[01:47:32.294 --> 01:47:39.162]  And interesting enough, that 737, the paper was held by the Lippo Bank, which is in China.
[01:47:39.583 --> 01:47:44.889]  And Lippo Bank, strangely enough, has a branch office in Little Rock, Arkansas, where the chips are made.
[01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:47.050]  Okay, let me expand on this.
[01:47:47.110 --> 01:47:55.953]  The UK Daily Mail story from Sunday headlined, New Autopilot will make another 9-11 impossible unless, of course, the real terrorists have access to the autopilot.
[01:47:56.853 --> 01:48:00.095]  Do you think this is them trying to introduce us to the public now as a PR stunt?
[01:48:00.355 --> 01:48:03.436]  Why is this breaking in the news now, in your opinion, David Hawkins?
[01:48:04.417 --> 01:48:07.118]  Well, it's breaking in the news because we've broken it, I think, Alex.
[01:48:07.618 --> 01:48:12.980]  Field has done a wonderful job in contacting the authorities, and he's done it in a very measured and professional way.
[01:48:13.827 --> 01:48:16.148]  And the silence is deafening.
[01:48:16.268 --> 01:48:19.289]  I mean, I was a safety officer in the international oil industry.
[01:48:19.309 --> 01:48:20.689]  I'm an expert in explosives.
[01:48:21.329 --> 01:48:39.635]  And if I knew, for whatever reason, someone was rigging an offshore rig, you know, where people can only escape quickly with great difficulty, with explosives in the event of some arbitrary protection of shipping lanes, etc., etc., then I would have forbidden any of my employees to go to that rig.
[01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:44.232]  Where do you see this going?
[01:48:44.452 --> 01:48:55.083]  I mean, they've been trying to deny they have this technology, now here it is, and again, why is this Boeing executive, the engineer, talking about we can get in trouble from the BATF over these exploding doors?
[01:48:55.924 --> 01:49:03.592]  I have a certain sympathy for the Boeing directors because I think what's happened in the last 15 years is that we've got organized crime
[01:49:04.295 --> 01:49:08.077]  Operating through the loan syndicates that finance a lot of this.
[01:49:08.117 --> 01:49:13.621]  And for example, all Boeing's exports are financed through the Ex-Im, the Export-Import Bank.
[01:49:14.221 --> 01:49:20.805]  And sitting behind the Export-Import Bank is principally JP Morgan, the Rockefeller-Kissinger conglomerate.
[01:49:20.865 --> 01:49:26.228]  So, effectively what you've got are the banks now control the paper on Boeing.
[01:49:26.348 --> 01:49:32.892]  So, you've got a racketeering situation where Boeing directors, I believe, are being threatened, physically or financially.
[01:49:33.610 --> 01:49:34.672]  And they're doing what they're told.
[01:49:36.475 --> 01:49:39.901]  I just got a report here from Cistron Donner.
[01:49:40.321 --> 01:49:43.867]  More than 90,000 QSR-11s are now in the field.
[01:49:44.248 --> 01:49:45.429]  That's their press release.
[01:49:47.272 --> 01:49:47.974]  Oh my gosh.
[01:49:52.233 --> 01:49:57.703]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:49:58.064 --> 01:50:05.657]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:06.385 --> 01:50:13.429]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:13.829 --> 01:50:25.275]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:25.575 --> 01:50:29.117]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:29.538 --> 01:50:31.479]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:31.799 --> 01:50:35.581]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:08.090 --> 01:51:09.871]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.

[01:52:42.904 --> 01:52:47.385]  HerbalHealer.com Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:00.930]  Welcome back!
[01:53:27.819 --> 01:53:48.505]  Knowing to David Hawkins and Captain Field McConnell, former Northwest Airlines pilot resigned on Monday over all this, Ciscaron Donner Internal QRSS-11, it's saying more than 90,000 QRS-11s are in the field, and it has a picture of the chip system, the integrated system.
[01:53:49.226 --> 01:53:51.946]  What does that mean, 90,000 of these are in the field?
[01:53:52.967 --> 01:53:56.208]  30,000 aircraft could be armed, or less than 30,000 with spares.
[01:54:02.671 --> 01:54:18.296]  Yes, and that configuration, the tri-axial configuration, is handled by a French company, Thales, which was the preferred weapons supplier to Saddam Hussein, and on the 1st of June 2001, a few months before 9-11, Thales and Raytheon
[01:54:19.358 --> 01:54:25.881]  Uh, went into a partnership for the automatic landing of aircraft, amongst other things, ground radars.
[01:54:25.901 --> 01:54:26.781]  But let me just stop you.
[01:54:26.801 --> 01:54:36.045]  When they say, in the field, that's nomenclature, and it goes on to say in the aircraft, they certainly wouldn't just produce 90,000 of these and have them sitting there on shelves.
[01:54:36.446 --> 01:54:39.547]  Do you believe that much of the aircraft fleet out there has these?
[01:54:40.919 --> 01:54:53.626]  Well, an unknown number, the majority of them I think have gone into more conventional like automobiles, you know, because you've got now, this is effectively the advanced technology of GPS, Global Positioning Systems.
[01:54:55.407 --> 01:55:05.272]  So there's a lot of devices that are civilian use, and what's happened is, with the corruption of the US Department of Commerce, particularly after the death of Ron Brown,
[01:55:06.096 --> 01:55:12.843]  The ability to watch for the transfer of military-sensitive technology into the commercial area collapsed.
[01:55:13.925 --> 01:55:16.027]  And it was taken over by the Department of State.
[01:55:16.087 --> 01:55:24.476]  So now, what effectively happened in the Clinton administration with John Kachalokashvili, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[01:55:25.089 --> 01:55:29.812]  There was a complete hollowing out of America's weapons secrets.
[01:55:30.292 --> 01:55:35.695]  Sure, and of course the Air Force colonel, the head coroner, said that he'd been shot in the back of the head.
[01:55:36.276 --> 01:55:37.477]  That was in the New York Times.
[01:55:37.517 --> 01:55:39.858]  But I mean, we've got about a minute or two before this hour ends.
[01:55:40.398 --> 01:55:46.202]  Just simply put, if you had two minutes, national TV, to explain this, what has happened, what is going on?
[01:55:46.222 --> 01:55:48.984]  Because so much of what you said is now checking out.
[01:55:49.044 --> 01:55:49.624]  What does this mean?
[01:55:50.416 --> 01:56:17.562]  It means that there are at least 120 Boeing commercial aircraft, and possibly as many as 2,000 to 3,000, flying above North America and its allies around the world, and China and the island of Taiwan, that could simultaneously, through the Iridium satellite communication systems, be converted into incendiary or explosive-laden drones to take out key strategic targets.
[01:56:18.405 --> 01:56:20.146]  So, a secret superweapon?
[01:56:21.406 --> 01:56:21.906]  Absolutely.
[01:56:21.966 --> 01:56:31.989]  It's a dual-use, improvised killing device, where they've converted the civilian fleet of aircraft into... Perfectly camouflaged!
[01:56:32.009 --> 01:56:38.831]  We know there were Russian plans, and they put it in the movie Red Dawn, but there were real Russian plans to have commandos come in and camouflage passenger jets.
[01:56:39.711 --> 01:56:40.111]  Exactly.
[01:56:40.211 --> 01:56:42.812]  And basically, you've got an Al-Qaeda Trojan horse
[01:56:43.456 --> 01:56:48.618]  And sitting behind it is this organization, Carlisle Canada, and its big union pension fund.
[01:56:48.678 --> 01:56:53.900]  And we have the FBI agent Robert Wright crying on TV saying, here's a letter, I'll be arrested if I tell you what I know.
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:58.142]  All I can tell you is the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens at the National Press Club.
[01:56:59.503 --> 01:57:02.944]  Well, I'm very wary of arguing by associations.
[01:57:03.044 --> 01:57:12.548]  My line of logic takes me to the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, and the key partners during the development of this treasonous transfer of technology
[01:57:13.075 --> 01:57:24.504]  Which includes Joe Giroir, who handles the gyroscope, Webster Hubble, who handled the encryption backdoor into military intelligence, and a woman by the name of Hillary Clinton.
[01:57:25.044 --> 01:57:27.126]  We'll be right back to discuss it in the second hour.
[01:57:28.747 --> 01:57:33.291]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:45.234 --> 01:57:45.874]  Big Brother.
[01:57:46.534 --> 01:57:47.594]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:48.315 --> 01:57:49.415]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:50.075 --> 01:57:50.896]  You want answers?
[01:57:51.636 --> 01:57:52.496]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:52.516 --> 01:57:57.078]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:57.398 --> 01:58:01.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:03.937 --> 01:58:06.478]  We know the Bush administration had 44,000 U.S.
[01:58:06.838 --> 01:58:14.922]  troops, 18,000 British troops massed in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in the months before 9-11 with a launch order to launch the war on his desk.
[01:58:15.062 --> 01:58:16.402]  Newsweek reported the day before.
[01:58:17.083 --> 01:58:25.226]  We know Dick Cheney took the shoot-down powers away from NORAD, away from the generals and admirals and their designates.
[01:58:26.537 --> 01:58:32.301]  In June, several months before 9-11, clearly the evidence is you've got multiple governments involved.
[01:58:32.401 --> 01:58:34.202]  You've got our government involved.
[01:58:34.262 --> 01:58:38.244]  It is true the Carlisle Group, BCCI, did have connections to Saddam.
[01:58:38.284 --> 01:58:39.525]  Our guest keeps bringing that up.
[01:58:40.085 --> 01:58:44.368]  Regardless of all of that, we know now that they do have these remote control systems.
[01:58:44.728 --> 01:58:46.269]  We know they were put on 120 aircraft with 20-something spares.
[01:58:48.527 --> 01:58:50.709]  We know Boeing was fined for this.
[01:58:51.149 --> 01:58:55.232]  Now they're announcing that they're planning to put them on planes with government approval for our safety.
[01:58:55.792 --> 01:59:00.716]  The big question here is, can those satellites, quote, be hacked into?
[01:59:00.756 --> 01:59:02.977]  Let's say the government's good and loving and they're not involved in this.
[01:59:03.337 --> 01:59:03.938]  Obviously they are.
[01:59:04.238 --> 01:59:04.778]  Elements of it.
[01:59:05.219 --> 01:59:05.739]  Rogue elements.
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:08.201]  And we have the motive here.
[01:59:08.561 --> 01:59:12.524]  Oil, police state, weapons sales, dominant empire, pretext.
[01:59:13.693 --> 01:59:24.036]  All the big papers written up by Brzezinski in 97 and then, of course, by Pinak in 2000, September, Rebuilding America's Defenses, that helpful Pearl Harbor catalyzing event.
[01:59:25.256 --> 01:59:27.337]  So look at the wide spectrum of data here.
[01:59:27.877 --> 01:59:34.179]  This is Black Ops all the way, and it's no doubt they'd use different money laundering fronts and groups to do it.
[01:59:35.019 --> 01:59:36.100]  But the big question here is,
[01:59:38.104 --> 01:59:49.594]  Will this story get out to the people that remote control devices are at least on some planes, that they now want to put them on more planes publicly, and that these could easily be commandeered by someone else, or could malfunction?
[01:59:49.634 --> 01:59:56.660]  Can you speak, both Field McConnell, the retired airline pilot who's been working on this, or David Hawkins?
[01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:59.302]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:00:00.842 --> 02:00:08.625]  Can you speak to any information you have on how this could be hacked into or how some other government could get control of this?
[02:00:08.945 --> 02:00:13.107]  Because if the entire fleet gets this, I mean, this is a disaster waiting to happen.
[02:00:13.127 --> 02:00:15.828]  What if there's a solar flare and it blows out all the satellites?
[02:00:15.868 --> 02:00:16.588]  There's malfunctions.
[02:00:16.968 --> 02:00:17.849]  Anything could happen.
[02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:20.530]  David, may I go first?
[02:00:20.550 --> 02:00:24.251]  Yeah, I'm going to make it brief in layman's terms and then David will flesh it out with technology.
[02:00:24.671 --> 02:00:26.612]  But two things come to mind.
[02:00:26.672 --> 02:00:29.513]  Number one, if I were a passenger anywhere in the world,
[02:00:30.006 --> 02:00:35.811]  I would request of my airline host that they tell me if this technology is installed.
[02:00:36.571 --> 02:00:41.715]  I think just by people becoming informed and asking the question, the technology will be forced to be removed.
[02:00:42.136 --> 02:00:50.903]  Secondly, as an olive branch, I would suggest, because I like to play fair and take the high road, if Boeing Aircraft would prove to me
[02:00:51.736 --> 02:01:07.766]  Which aircraft had the QRS's installed and then sign a letter notarized with the CEO's signature that these tail numbers, the specific airplanes, have had specific part number QRS 11 installed, then I would certainly drop that suit.
[02:01:08.146 --> 02:01:14.630]  What I'm trying to do is highlight the issue, get it into the light of open court, and let the chips fall.
[02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:15.781]  Poor choice of words.
[02:01:15.801 --> 02:01:21.125]  I was going to say let the chips fall where they may, but I'd rather have the chips fall into a garbage can and be destroyed.
[02:01:21.586 --> 02:01:22.467]  Exactly.
[02:01:22.527 --> 02:01:23.067]  Mr. Hawkins?
[02:01:24.308 --> 02:01:26.210]  Yeah, if I can just give a big picture here.
[02:01:26.330 --> 02:01:32.416]  On the war games, the 1st of June, 2001, there were actually two war games going on.
[02:01:32.556 --> 02:01:41.444]  One in the United States, which was the simulated attack by Canada onto the Capitol building using a hijacked plane flown by an al-Qaeda attack team.
[02:01:41.983 --> 02:01:51.293]  But there was another very important war game going on, which is in the Straits of Formosa, where the Chinese People's Liberation Army were rehearsing an attack on Taiwan.
[02:01:51.473 --> 02:01:53.335]  So this is what was going to happen on 9-11.
[02:01:53.876 --> 02:01:59.722]  Had Flight 93 left on time, 41 minutes late, it would have hit its target in Washington, D.C.
[02:01:59.762 --> 02:02:02.986]  at the same time as the alleged Flight 77 took out the U.S.
[02:02:03.026 --> 02:02:03.967]  Naval Command Center.
[02:02:04.791 --> 02:02:07.594]  And it would appear that the target was the Capitol building, i.e.
[02:02:07.874 --> 02:02:10.096]  they would have killed hundreds of congressmen and senators.
[02:02:10.116 --> 02:02:10.956]  That's what I say.
[02:02:11.277 --> 02:02:15.020]  That's the intel I've got from sources, is it was going to be a decapitation move on the Capitol.
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:16.141]  Exactly.
[02:02:16.161 --> 02:02:22.366]  And then the Chinese, Alex, would have invaded Taiwan using the 120 or 150 planes converted to fly as cluster bomb drones.
[02:02:29.506 --> 02:02:30.867]  But I think that's a stretch.
[02:02:31.107 --> 02:02:34.869]  They have a big enough conventional military to not need to use aircraft.
[02:02:34.989 --> 02:02:36.790]  I mean, and then that would show their hand.
[02:02:37.391 --> 02:02:40.673]  They could then connect that back and then... We'll be right back.
[02:02:44.135 --> 02:02:47.276]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:47.636 --> 02:02:49.578]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:49.958 --> 02:02:57.582]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:05.344]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:05.744 --> 02:03:17.150]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:17.470 --> 02:03:20.931]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:21.432 --> 02:03:23.353]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:23.713 --> 02:03:27.535]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:40.726 --> 02:03:43.749]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:03:44.049 --> 02:03:48.993]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:03:49.234 --> 02:03:53.597]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:03:53.898 --> 02:03:58.782]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron.
[02:03:58.962 --> 02:04:02.806]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:04:03.006 --> 02:04:06.629]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:04:06.909 --> 02:04:11.954]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:04:12.234 --> 02:04:18.980]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:20.001]  What about you?
[02:04:20.752 --> 02:04:28.654]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:04:40.977 --> 02:04:42.738]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:04:42.858 --> 02:04:44.098]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:04:44.338 --> 02:04:47.159]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:04:47.519 --> 02:04:50.260]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:57.570]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:05:45.481 --> 02:05:46.122]  Big Brother.
[02:05:46.782 --> 02:05:47.843]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:48.564 --> 02:05:49.665]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:50.325 --> 02:05:51.146]  You want answers?
[02:05:51.886 --> 02:05:53.828]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:53.848 --> 02:05:57.250]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.631 --> 02:06:01.774]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:02.695 --> 02:06:08.399]  For stations and listeners that just joined us, we're walking through some very complex issues here.
[02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:11.942]  Defense contractors, black ops, money laundering,
[02:06:13.169 --> 02:06:14.252]  Basically our government.
[02:06:16.177 --> 02:06:19.665]  Tied in with the communist Chinese who are the new chosen ones globally.
[02:06:20.587 --> 02:06:26.430]  All of our major infrastructure and military hardware, capacity, research and development being transferred feverishly.
[02:06:26.490 --> 02:06:27.351]  That's on the record.
[02:06:27.891 --> 02:06:34.495]  Almost everything our guests are saying I'm able to confirm on my own research or from knowledge or from reports that stream into me.
[02:06:34.515 --> 02:06:36.876]  Let me just recap for those that just joined us.
[02:06:37.297 --> 02:06:38.637]  This came out on Tuesday.
[02:06:38.737 --> 02:06:42.139]  Northwest Pilot from rural Glendon alleges 9-11 cover-up.
[02:06:43.460 --> 02:06:46.801]  Field McConnell is convinced 9-11 terrorist attacks are being covered up.
[02:06:47.221 --> 02:06:54.343]  The Northwest Airlines pilot from rural Glendon, Minnesota said a second attack is imminent and conspirators already have aborted their plan once this year.
[02:06:54.863 --> 02:07:03.805]  Those beliefs prompted him to begin writing for a website where like-minded people gather to file a lawsuit in Fargo Federal Court to expose an alleged conspiracy.
[02:07:04.835 --> 02:07:14.703]  In the lawsuit filed last week, claims Boeing Company and the Airline Pilots Association can't assure him that the B747-400 planes are safe.
[02:07:15.203 --> 02:07:23.309]  McConnell, who is in the process of seeking an early retirement, which he did do on Monday, from Northwest claims the planes are rigged by Boeing and can be remotely detonated.
[02:07:23.609 --> 02:07:26.292]  At the bare minimum, they admit that the doors are exploding.
[02:07:26.652 --> 02:07:32.817]  And I have one of the chief Boeing engineers in a speech last year saying that we can get in a lot of trouble from the BATF over this.
[02:07:33.237 --> 02:07:34.578]  Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[02:07:35.373 --> 02:07:39.157]  So if the West Central Tribune's Steve Wagner did his research, he'd find that real fast.
[02:07:39.697 --> 02:07:49.487]  We do not believe in any way, shape, or form that this is true, said Pete Janhoon, a spokesman for ALPA, the world's largest pilot's union.
[02:07:49.907 --> 02:07:54.191]  One senior lawyer and senior engineer both said that on the face, it's an insane complaint.
[02:07:54.532 --> 02:07:55.793]  It sounds like he's a troubled guy.
[02:07:56.596 --> 02:08:07.026]  Now we know they just got a huge $615 million fine last year for illegally transferring 120 of these planes, 20 plus separate boxes to hook them into other planes.
[02:08:07.447 --> 02:08:09.068]  They won't say whether they've taken them out.
[02:08:09.549 --> 02:08:16.636]  They're bragging in another report here from Sunday out of the UK Daily Mail, big paper, new autopilot will make another 9-11 impossible.
[02:08:18.274 --> 02:08:21.576]  Unless, of course, the real terrorists have access to the autopilot we added.
[02:08:22.197 --> 02:08:27.700]  A hijack-proof piling system for airplanes is being developed to prevent terrorists repeating the 9-11 outrages.
[02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:36.466]  The mechanism is designed to make it impossible to crash the aircraft into air or land targets and enable the plane to be flown by remote control from the ground in the event of an emergency.
[02:08:37.226 --> 02:08:43.807]  Scientists at aircraft giant Boeing are testing a tamper-proof autopilot system, which is a state-of-the-art computer and satellite technology.
[02:08:44.228 --> 02:08:53.389]  It will be activated by the pilot flicking a simple switch or by pressure sensors fitted into the cockpit door that will respond to any excessive force as terrorists try to break into the flight deck.
[02:08:53.729 --> 02:08:58.590]  Once triggered, no one on board will be able, that's key, no one on board will be able to deactivate the system.
[02:08:58.650 --> 02:09:03.651]  Currently, all autopilots are manually switched on and off at the discretion of pilots.
[02:09:03.812 --> 02:09:05.952]  Once this is activated, the pilot loses all control.
[02:09:07.637 --> 02:09:17.880]  The so-called Autopilot System, or Uninterruptible Autopilot System, patented secretly by Boeing in the U.S.
[02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:26.203]  last week, will connect ground controllers and security services with aircraft using radio waves and global satellite positioning systems.
[02:09:28.444 --> 02:09:29.124]  This is amazing.
[02:09:29.164 --> 02:09:35.346]  Now, during the Cold War, and still, the Strategic Air Command, and the missiles as well,
[02:09:36.278 --> 02:09:43.924]  Until the last few years, weren't allowed to be able to be in radio contact because they knew they could be jammed or sent false signals.
[02:09:45.005 --> 02:09:54.033]  Again, terrorists, foreign governments, our own government, that's the main people, this group of criminals, we've been hijacked by total mafia, completely.
[02:09:54.073 --> 02:09:56.535]  Trillions missing from the Pentagon, wanton looting everywhere.
[02:09:57.413 --> 02:10:00.119]  They could easily use our aircraft as weapons against us.
[02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:06.332]  The Air Force fleets and Army and Marine Corps aircraft are switching over to this.
[02:10:08.016 --> 02:10:08.557]  It's happening!
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:14.523]  And I found George Bush giving speeches in September about, well, we'll put these in the planes and stop hijacking.
[02:10:14.944 --> 02:10:15.964]  I found all these other quotes.
[02:10:16.004 --> 02:10:17.165]  The company's bragging about it.
[02:10:17.505 --> 02:10:20.167]  And then I've seen other people in the national news go, that's ridiculous.
[02:10:20.227 --> 02:10:20.988]  None of this exists.
[02:10:21.268 --> 02:10:23.089]  It's impossible to remote control planes.
[02:10:23.309 --> 02:10:24.170]  There was never a test.
[02:10:24.410 --> 02:10:25.731]  Boeing says they're testing it now.
[02:10:25.791 --> 02:10:27.692]  They tested it in 1997.
[02:10:28.653 --> 02:10:34.357]  And they tested it again in 2001, early 2001, in New Mexico, in California.
[02:10:34.397 --> 02:10:35.938]  This has been perfected for decades.
[02:10:36.318 --> 02:10:38.199]  Let's go back to David Hawkins.
[02:10:38.279 --> 02:10:39.340]  David, can you comment on that?
[02:10:40.106 --> 02:10:43.127]  Well, exactly, and they were testing the prototype on 9-11.
[02:10:43.407 --> 02:10:47.048]  I mean, the Iridium system, and incidentally, we mentioned Buzzy Crongaard.
[02:10:47.409 --> 02:10:51.010]  Buzzy Crongaard and Tom Ridge are now directors of Iridium.
[02:10:51.770 --> 02:10:53.871]  Now, Tom Ridge is governor of Pennsylvania.
[02:10:53.891 --> 02:11:04.214]  He instructed either the FEMA people, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or the State's National Guard, and this is a technical term, to stoliate evidence.
[02:11:04.614 --> 02:11:08.856]  They took the evidence away from the field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania,
[02:11:09.725 --> 02:11:13.209]  And a debris field that was eight mile long all the way to New Baltimore.
[02:11:14.331 --> 02:11:15.352]  That's a criminal offense.
[02:11:15.912 --> 02:11:20.198]  Well, we see the cover-up on Oklahoma City, cover-up on Ground Zero, cover-up at the Pentagon.
[02:11:21.119 --> 02:11:23.922]  Instantly out there, uh, covering this up.
[02:11:24.202 --> 02:11:27.026]  Uh, where do you see this going?
[02:11:27.066 --> 02:11:29.589]  Because they can't talk out both sides of their mouths.
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:37.246]  Well now, thank heavens for Field McConnell's courage in going forward with this because, you know, it's a considerable thing.
[02:11:37.306 --> 02:11:41.890]  He's put his career at risk and there's lots of people calling him crazy or implying that he's crazy.
[02:11:43.131 --> 02:11:54.661]  We have, collectively, or he will have a first lawsuit in Fargo, probably where the subpoena will be issued to the Board of Directors of Boeing and their backers.
[02:11:55.256 --> 02:12:06.660]  To come to Fargo, and I believe Captain McConnell, well I know Captain McConnell is going to argue pro se, he doesn't need a lawyer as a pilot, fighter pilot and airline pilot, to put questions to these people.
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:19.305]  Now, the tragedy from Boeing's point of view, and of course their denial is going to prove to be extremely expensive for that company, is they're in the process, they've got rid of all the pilots and aeronautical engineers on their board,
[02:12:19.975 --> 02:12:23.819]  It's now stuffed with lawyers and accountants and hangers-on.
[02:12:24.139 --> 02:12:25.681]  None of them know how to fly a plane!
[02:12:27.382 --> 02:12:36.732]  Isn't this global mafia going to have more and more trouble as they fire every expert they've got in the entire infrastructure, and it's just gangsters trying to control the technocracy?
[02:12:37.272 --> 02:12:42.818]  Well, exactly, and that's why it's very important, for example, Phil Condit, who was the CEO of Boeing,
[02:12:43.422 --> 02:12:44.442]  He was booted out.
[02:12:44.542 --> 02:12:47.063]  Now, there was an illustrious aeronautical engineer.
[02:12:47.103 --> 02:13:06.727]  Now, I'm an engineer, and I work for Schlumberger, and what I noticed with these large corporations, the people who know actually how to run the corporation and develop it and develop new products, they're being pushed to one side, and you've got this sort of parasitical cloud of lawyers and accountants taking over and hedge funds, and they run the companies into the ground, and that's what's happening to Boeing.
[02:13:07.888 --> 02:13:09.308]  Like a cloud of locusts.
[02:13:10.419 --> 02:13:11.100]  Yes, exactly.
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:14.983]  And now, I'm sure you know, almost $4 trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[02:13:15.343 --> 02:13:18.525]  The AP reported September 10th, over $2 trillion missing.
[02:13:18.885 --> 02:13:23.829]  I mean, I've never seen in history such a wild, voracious looting.
[02:13:23.869 --> 02:13:26.331]  It's as if they know this whole ship's going down or something.
[02:13:26.751 --> 02:13:35.418]  Yes, and now there's a very interesting woman who was the number two procurement officer at the United States Air Force, appointed by Clinton, a woman called Darlene Druin.
[02:13:36.307 --> 02:13:49.370]  Basically, she was backdooring contracts to Boeing, including the refueling tanker, a lease arrangement that would have given them $6 billion in excess profits, in return for Boeing offering her children jobs.
[02:13:49.870 --> 02:13:50.431]  Unbelievable.
[02:13:50.531 --> 02:13:59.073]  Anyway, after 9-1-1, and I'll come back to her role on 9-1-1, after 9-1-1, she became a Vice President of Boeing, and then she went to jail.
[02:13:59.433 --> 02:14:03.694]  Now, back on 9-1-1, she had another job, apart from being Procurement Officer,
[02:14:04.661 --> 02:14:13.145]  Uh, for the United States Air Force, and she was the chairman of the board of directors of the NATO AWACS program, the Airborne Warning and Command Systems.
[02:14:14.066 --> 02:14:23.070]  And on 9-11, there were two AWACS, one above Washington and one above New York, and they were coordinating the Red Team attack.
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:45.117]  Is it possible that many individuals side-by-side, this is how they bootleg, that's why they run drills simultaneously with the 7-7 bombings, with the first World Trade Center attack in Oklahoma City, that there could be people in the red team, command centers, who thought it was a drill and didn't know those blips were real?
[02:14:45.918 --> 02:14:48.420]  Yeah, this is the absolutely sinister approach.
[02:14:48.460 --> 02:14:49.001]  These guys
[02:14:49.542 --> 02:15:04.308]  have logged the war games through the iridium voice recording system so they now have some tapes of the voices of the red team commanders and the voices of the blue team commanders participating in what they thought was a simulated training exercises i.e.
[02:15:04.868 --> 02:15:16.233]  a simulated red team commander would have been trying desperately to get the weapons platforms past the initial and secondary and tertiary defenses of the pentagon as close as possible to the target so
[02:15:16.972 --> 02:15:21.075]  Innocently, they would be describing maneuvers to bypass the blue team.
[02:15:21.115 --> 02:15:27.639]  What about that earlier report of a special transmission being sent by the plane saying it was a friendly to the Pentagon?
[02:15:27.659 --> 02:15:28.139]  Remember that?
[02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:33.543]  That's right, and all of those, and this comes back to this illegally modified flight box.
[02:15:33.583 --> 02:15:46.051]  They've modified the flight box at Boeing to bypass the transponder system, and none of the pilots, the four hijacked pilots, sent the emergency code, which Field Will correct me here, but it's HJCK.
[02:15:47.031 --> 02:15:49.732]  Which is a signal to the air traffic control that they've been hijacked.
[02:15:50.092 --> 02:15:50.953]  None of them sent that.
[02:15:51.113 --> 02:15:56.555]  I believe the transponder was switched over remotely by a corrupt and treasonous ground crew.
[02:15:57.316 --> 02:15:59.617]  And they were unable to communicate that they've been hijacked.
[02:16:00.117 --> 02:16:03.498]  Let's go back to Field McConnell.
[02:16:03.638 --> 02:16:04.979]  Field, you want to comment on what we just said?
[02:16:05.339 --> 02:16:05.779]  Yes, I do.
[02:16:05.799 --> 02:16:08.341]  But before I do that, I want to ask your listeners a question.
[02:16:08.821 --> 02:16:13.543]  Regarding my mental health, would you rather have an engineer, an attorney in the cockpit, or two people like me?
[02:16:15.259 --> 02:16:21.423]  Well, no, we understand you've got a good record in Northwest, and you're a fighter pilot in the military, and you've quit over all this and gone public.
[02:16:21.803 --> 02:16:24.665]  Oh, yes, and I... Well, I mean, here's my point.
[02:16:25.106 --> 02:16:27.687]  The press is going, oh, he says explosives, ha, ha, ha.
[02:16:28.048 --> 02:16:34.752]  Here they are admitting, in this Seattle Post-Intelligencer article, that they've got exploding doors, and that they could get in trouble for it.
[02:16:35.332 --> 02:16:40.576]  Now, I don't know why they're admitting that, and then they admit that they did fit planes with these systems,
[02:16:42.419 --> 02:16:49.402]  It's very weird, but I think part of the answer is there's too many employees at Boeing, so they're talking out of both sides of their mouth, but not one mouth, but numerous mouths.
[02:16:50.062 --> 02:16:51.823]  They're fighting for their survival.
[02:16:52.303 --> 02:17:01.367]  A very good process going forward to be put Boeing under a trusteeship, perhaps of the Pentagon or any large organization.
[02:17:01.889 --> 02:17:06.555]  And maybe hire some private security people that understand... No, Boeing should have never gone to China!
[02:17:06.615 --> 02:17:07.876]  How insane is that?
[02:17:08.157 --> 02:17:16.387]  Well, China's hoping somebody will attack the United States so they can come in behind them because they may be cowardly and not want to be the first guys to find us.
[02:17:18.380 --> 02:17:19.642]  Stay there, both of you gentlemen.
[02:17:20.443 --> 02:17:22.365]  I won't open the phones up in the last 30 minutes.
[02:17:22.705 --> 02:17:29.153]  On this subject, 9-11, transponders, exploding doors, the cover up unraveling.
[02:17:29.513 --> 02:17:32.737]  This is real, this is important, this is powerful.
[02:17:32.757 --> 02:17:33.278]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:33.318 --> 02:17:33.798]  It's Wednesday.
[02:17:41.744 --> 02:17:42.724]  Good morning, honey!
[02:17:43.085 --> 02:17:43.645]  Wow!
[02:17:43.805 --> 02:17:49.067]  The weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[02:17:49.367 --> 02:17:51.768]  Yeah... Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:17:52.128 --> 02:17:55.529]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[02:17:55.989 --> 02:17:57.490]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:17:57.930 --> 02:17:59.651]  And what am I gonna do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:18:00.031 --> 02:18:01.812]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:18:02.012 --> 02:18:02.852]  Honey, cheer up!
[02:18:04.588 --> 02:18:17.037]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[02:18:17.317 --> 02:18:22.141]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[02:18:22.481 --> 02:18:23.663]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[02:18:40.946 --> 02:18:42.807]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:18:42.867 --> 02:18:43.268]  It's March 7, 2007.
[02:18:43.648 --> 02:18:44.228]  Gold is at $645.20.
[02:18:44.268 --> 02:18:47.050]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $663.04, $333.54 for half, $167.07 for quarter ounce coins.
[02:18:47.090 --> 02:18:47.510]  That's $663.04, $333.54, and $167.07.
[02:18:59.557 --> 02:19:03.161]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[02:19:03.241 --> 02:19:06.264]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[02:19:06.344 --> 02:19:15.514]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[02:19:15.834 --> 02:19:21.180]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:23.943]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[02:19:24.003 --> 02:19:26.447]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[02:19:26.847 --> 02:19:30.152]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.212 --> 02:19:33.957]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[02:19:33.997 --> 02:19:34.277]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:34.297 --> 02:19:34.477]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:41.801 --> 02:19:44.362]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:44.962 --> 02:19:50.023]  Did you know that the United Nations has never settled disputes, but always makes them worse?
[02:19:50.883 --> 02:19:55.124]  Our own ambassador to the United Nations in 1982 admitted such.
[02:19:55.424 --> 02:20:03.786]  Did you know that the United Nations ignores communist atrocities, but always targets non-communist nations and their leaders for overthrow?

[02:22:02.729 --> 02:22:03.370]  Welcome back.
[02:22:04.130 --> 02:22:05.691]  We'll be taking your calls in the next segment.
[02:22:05.711 --> 02:22:10.175]  Your questions will probably be revealing.
[02:22:10.195 --> 02:22:10.455]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:11.636 --> 02:22:16.599]  David Hawkins, who is a forensic economist and trained at Cambridge, is our guest.
[02:22:16.659 --> 02:22:22.624]  And we have retired, just retired on Monday, Captain Field McConnell, who flew for Northwest Airlines.
[02:22:23.044 --> 02:22:28.088]  He's saying, look, if you've got chips that can be grabbed or hijacked or... I mean, let's say the government's not involved.
[02:22:28.108 --> 02:22:28.728]  They're good people.
[02:22:29.068 --> 02:22:29.529]  We love them.
[02:22:30.334 --> 02:22:32.415]  Uh, they're perfect, they weren't involved, they just love us.
[02:22:32.935 --> 02:22:33.916]  They wouldn't hurt us fly.
[02:22:33.936 --> 02:22:40.879]  Uh, foreign corporations, foreign governments, we know they've compromised the Iridium system, that's been in the news for five years.
[02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:47.703]  We know we've been totally hacked into, we know they've taken over, Chinese hackers have taken over our central NORAD computers before.
[02:22:47.723 --> 02:22:53.405]  Uh, how could any of these be on planes when they could malfunction or be commandeered?
[02:22:53.425 --> 02:22:54.946]  Uh, Field McConnell?
[02:22:56.067 --> 02:22:56.327]  Yes sir?
[02:22:57.333 --> 02:22:58.994]  I mean, how could these be on planes?
[02:22:59.014 --> 02:23:01.095]  How do we find out the 120 they're on?
[02:23:02.036 --> 02:23:07.419]  It was basically, well, how do we find out specific airplane tail numbers?
[02:23:07.439 --> 02:23:22.227]  You'd have to get the Canadian Mounted Police and maybe their reciprocal to the, or their version of the FBI to go storm a, or ask for permission to enter Cascade Airways, I believe is the name of the installation facility in British Columbia.
[02:23:22.628 --> 02:23:26.490]  And the other installation facility is in China that might be more difficult to get into.
[02:23:27.014 --> 02:23:30.556]  But those chips need to get out of the airplanes.
[02:23:30.596 --> 02:23:36.520]  But as far as creating fear among Americans or travelers worldwide, I would urge caution.
[02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:44.246]  And I think that this threat, even though the hardware has not been removed, I think the opportunity to deploy the hardware has been removed.
[02:23:44.326 --> 02:23:56.254]  About 10 days ago, I sent an electronic letter out identifying that should I slip on a banana peel or be hit broadside in an intersection, I wanted to help law enforcement find out who was behind it.
[02:23:57.600 --> 02:24:06.453]  Uh, 100 names, roughly 50 of them being the board of directors at Boeing because I have no problem with Boeing if they'd call me now and tell me that they've got proof the QRS is 11 throughout.
[02:24:07.307 --> 02:24:16.333]  I would go down to the courthouse today and cause, I have about another 12 days to amend my lawsuit, and I'd be more than happy to take Boeing off the lawsuit.
[02:24:16.393 --> 02:24:18.775]  Sure, they're just hoping this blows over and they'll continue.
[02:24:20.076 --> 02:24:28.501]  Now, going back to David Hawkins, David, where do you come up with this idea that someone could have put explosives in the insulation of aircraft?
[02:24:28.521 --> 02:24:29.562]  I see no evidence of that.
[02:24:33.177 --> 02:24:44.480]  There's a chemical propellant used in rocket fuel that includes what's called atomized aluminum powder, which is a few micrometers across.
[02:24:44.740 --> 02:24:56.323]  And when that comes into contact and is ignited with iron oxide, which is like rust, it generates a... it creates an incendiary that burns at 5,800 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:24:56.483 --> 02:25:00.944]  Now, the intriguing thing about solid propellant rocket fuel is that it's the kind that
[02:25:01.618 --> 02:25:02.118]  I don't know.
[02:25:23.130 --> 02:25:36.580]  Aircraft insulation, it's either acoustic or thermal or vibrational, that appears to be being installed by this Cascade Aerospace in Abbotsford, British Columbia, and it has a central core of black elastomer or rubber sheeting.
[02:25:37.140 --> 02:25:52.311]  Now, if you put that, if you took out the paneling in the fuselage, which is what Cascade does, and installed the insulation, the technicians installing that insulation, they could do it in perfectly good faith, because the intriguing thing about this material is it acts and feels and looks
[02:25:52.802 --> 02:25:53.582]  Like insulation.
[02:25:53.682 --> 02:25:58.944]  That is, it won't ignite until you reach a temperature of 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:25:59.044 --> 02:26:08.368]  Now, a jet fire as a result of a crash of an airplane wouldn't, even under ideal conditions, exceed a value of... Okay, well, I understand you can speculate all day on that.
[02:26:08.388 --> 02:26:10.309]  The other stuff you're saying hasn't been speculation.
[02:26:10.729 --> 02:26:22.073]  I mean, where do you come up with the fact that just because you think they installed some of these takeover chips, some of these autopilot remote control chips, that they would A, put this in the aircraft, and B, have a way to trigger it?
[02:26:22.956 --> 02:26:27.319]  Well, that's the only way you can explain a debris field that's eight miles long.
[02:26:27.859 --> 02:26:35.844]  I'm talking about United 93 in Pennsylvania, where the people who came to the scene of crime, their first reaction was, where's the plane?
[02:26:35.864 --> 02:26:40.547]  A number of them said, we could hear the sound of dripping plastic in the forest.
[02:26:41.208 --> 02:26:46.351]  And secondly, if they look inside the crater, there is no heavy, significant metal objects.
[02:26:46.411 --> 02:26:52.055]  Now, you can't destroy a plane in a conventional crash with a conventional jet fuel fire.
[02:26:52.711 --> 02:26:54.552]  You can't vaporize the passengers.
[02:26:54.612 --> 02:26:57.034]  You can't distribute a debris field eight miles long.
[02:26:57.134 --> 02:27:05.919]  So I'm, as an applied mathematician and an engineer, I'm trying to work out how they could possibly create what's called the energetics of such a crash.
[02:27:06.039 --> 02:27:09.922]  And the only way to do it is to use an ultra-high temperature accelerant.
[02:27:10.762 --> 02:27:11.683]  There is no alternative.
[02:27:13.052 --> 02:27:13.993]  Now I understand.
[02:27:14.073 --> 02:27:14.393]  Thank you.
[02:27:14.413 --> 02:27:15.533]  That's why we asked the question.
[02:27:15.613 --> 02:27:17.154]  Very interesting.
[02:27:17.534 --> 02:27:18.415]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:18.455 --> 02:27:20.476]  Let you gentlemen make any other key points you wish.
[02:27:20.536 --> 02:27:21.656]  Also plug the website.
[02:27:22.097 --> 02:27:23.818]  Then we're going to go right to your phone calls.
[02:27:24.398 --> 02:27:25.218]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:27:25.298 --> 02:27:29.400]  It's the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:31.361 --> 02:27:32.302]  We're on the march.
[02:27:32.742 --> 02:27:34.363]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:35.263 --> 02:27:37.945]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:48.934]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two book set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:27:49.314 --> 02:27:55.717]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:27:56.198 --> 02:28:06.083]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:28:06.583 --> 02:28:10.045]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:28:10.325 --> 02:28:13.027]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[02:28:13.648 --> 02:28:16.350]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.

[02:28:40.825 --> 02:28:45.770]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:28:46.090 --> 02:28:47.972]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:28:48.152 --> 02:28:51.215]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:28:51.395 --> 02:28:54.518]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:28:54.838 --> 02:28:56.680]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:28:56.940 --> 02:29:00.643]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:29:00.923 --> 02:29:03.586]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:29:03.606 --> 02:29:08.469]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:29:08.710 --> 02:29:13.013]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:29:13.414 --> 02:29:17.737]  The Bible says, Would like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, the unholy alliance.
[02:29:18.057 --> 02:29:20.079]  These materials document the global leaders,
[02:29:20.179 --> 02:29:20.479]  We're good.
[02:29:40.919 --> 02:29:42.441]  Shocking facts about magnesium.
[02:29:42.801 --> 02:29:51.429]  Magnesium deficiency can cause anxiety, asthma, depression, diabetes, fatigue, heart disease, hypertension, insomnia, migraines, osteoporosis, just to name a few.
[02:29:51.869 --> 02:29:54.632]  Pesticides and pollution have depleted the soil of magnesium.
[02:29:54.992 --> 02:29:57.315]  Processed foods are further stripped of magnesium.
[02:29:57.715 --> 02:30:00.938]  Flour loses 80%, polished rice 83%, cornstarch 97%, and white sugar from molasses 99%.
[02:30:05.402 --> 02:30:07.765]  Fluoridated water removes all magnesium.
[02:30:08.065 --> 02:30:10.968]  So how do we replace the magnesium our bodies so desperately need?
[02:30:11.408 --> 02:30:13.210]  Magnesium oil and gel!
[02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:17.995]  Magnesium oil and gel absorbs quickly through the skin so there are no gastrointestinal side effects.
[02:30:18.435 --> 02:30:20.117]  It comes in several different sizes so call 877.
[02:30:22.238 --> 02:30:24.499]  817-9829 and order yours today.
[02:30:24.879 --> 02:30:25.920]  Your body will thank you.
[02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:28.941]  Magnesium oil and gel could be the answer you've been looking for.
[02:30:29.361 --> 02:30:30.301]  Call the power hour at 877-817-9829.
[02:30:30.321 --> 02:30:30.501]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:30:30.541 --> 02:30:31.202]  Magnesium oil and gel.
[02:30:31.222 --> 02:30:32.302]  You can be you again.
[02:30:49.461 --> 02:30:50.321]  Welcome back!
[02:31:18.374 --> 02:31:20.877]  Look, Hitler was a thug.
[02:31:20.957 --> 02:31:21.878]  Stalin was a thug.
[02:31:21.938 --> 02:31:22.798]  Mao was a thug.
[02:31:23.099 --> 02:31:24.760]  These are just criminals that take over.
[02:31:24.780 --> 02:31:25.761]  That's what tyranny is.
[02:31:26.662 --> 02:31:28.404]  And they're destroying our national sovereignty.
[02:31:28.444 --> 02:31:29.885]  We're going into the North American Union.
[02:31:29.925 --> 02:31:30.626]  Who could believe it?
[02:31:30.766 --> 02:31:31.727]  And they keep it secret.
[02:31:32.027 --> 02:31:34.790]  And we get their own foyer documents in Canada last year.
[02:31:34.810 --> 02:31:39.435]  And it's all how to keep it secret from the public and how it is in the North American Union.
[02:31:40.115 --> 02:31:41.657]  I mean, that is hot treason right there.
[02:31:42.327 --> 02:31:44.068]  And we know 9-11's an inside job.
[02:31:44.088 --> 02:31:45.969]  We know the official story's totally impossible.
[02:31:46.269 --> 02:31:53.073]  We now know, and I've been told this from people that worked at Boeing, but they wouldn't go on record, that they did have remote control systems in many of their aircraft.
[02:31:53.113 --> 02:31:55.915]  I was told that in 2001, right through this year.
[02:31:57.395 --> 02:32:00.397]  And I've talked to other pilots who say, yeah, some airplanes do have those.
[02:32:00.457 --> 02:32:01.958]  Boeing is putting it in some aircraft.
[02:32:02.438 --> 02:32:05.100]  And of course, there's big lawsuits and news articles about it.
[02:32:05.440 --> 02:32:07.601]  And then people get up on TV and say it doesn't exist.
[02:32:07.641 --> 02:32:08.682]  It's conspiracy theorists.
[02:32:08.722 --> 02:32:09.282]  They're nuts.
[02:32:09.762 --> 02:32:11.183]  That technology doesn't exist.
[02:32:12.150 --> 02:32:13.711]  And then it turns out it's been installed.
[02:32:14.492 --> 02:32:17.394]  Folks, before we go back to our guest, I'm asking you to support us.
[02:32:17.494 --> 02:32:21.217]  Get my film, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:32:22.337 --> 02:32:25.160]  It is over three hours on one DVD.
[02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:27.581]  The film is right under two hours, 68 minutes of extras.
[02:32:28.082 --> 02:32:40.631]  It shows all the admitted examples where our criminal government and other governments that are illegitimate stage terror attacks as a pretext for controlling war and to unify societies under their banners.
[02:32:41.327 --> 02:32:44.357]  Hit America Freedom to Fascism to find out about the private Federal Reserve.
[02:32:44.397 --> 02:32:45.140]  That's another hoax.
[02:32:45.481 --> 02:32:47.629]  And the North American Union and the IRS.
[02:32:48.422 --> 02:32:51.085]  Get Loose Change 2nd Edition that we carry on DVD.
[02:32:51.165 --> 02:32:52.746]  The original from the folks that made it.
[02:32:52.766 --> 02:32:54.328]  Instead of just seeing it on the internet.
[02:32:54.688 --> 02:32:57.431]  Get them high quality information for your library.
[02:32:57.731 --> 02:32:59.352]  Make copies of Terror Storm.
[02:32:59.392 --> 02:33:00.474]  Make copies of Loose Change.
[02:33:00.774 --> 02:33:02.656]  Make copies of America Freedom to Fascism.
[02:33:02.996 --> 02:33:04.357]  The makers have all said you can.
[02:33:04.397 --> 02:33:06.419]  I'm telling you I want you to make copies of Terror Storm.
[02:33:06.739 --> 02:33:08.021]  Put it on AXS TV.
[02:33:08.321 --> 02:33:09.022]  Have parties.
[02:33:09.202 --> 02:33:10.183]  Show it to your neighbors.
[02:33:10.603 --> 02:33:11.344]  Get involved.
[02:33:13.510 --> 02:33:29.637]  We got 9-11 inside job t-shirts and baseball caps at near cost on the website, citizen rule books, other books and films, a huge library of the best materials available at the online video and bookstore shopping cart at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-9111.
[02:33:31.852 --> 02:33:33.393]  2-5-3, 3-1-3-9.
[02:33:35.434 --> 02:33:37.955]  Don't count on others to take action in this fight.
[02:33:38.335 --> 02:33:40.576]  Don't count on others to get the films and make copies.
[02:33:40.916 --> 02:33:45.038]  Don't count on others, well, thanks Alex for being there, we're glad somebody's fighting it.
[02:33:45.138 --> 02:33:45.438]  No.
[02:33:46.059 --> 02:33:47.239]  We need you to fight it.
[02:33:47.299 --> 02:33:53.682]  When you, the listeners, get the films, make copies, maybe a copy a week, a copy a day, two copies a day, a copy a month.
[02:33:54.402 --> 02:33:55.363]  Give it to ten people.
[02:33:56.588 --> 02:33:57.168]  It's easy.
[02:33:57.288 --> 02:33:58.448]  It's easy to burn copies.
[02:33:58.488 --> 02:34:03.170]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv, get a membership, download all my films in super high quality, burn them to death.
[02:34:03.250 --> 02:34:03.930]  Do it every day.
[02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:04.570]  Give it to people.
[02:34:04.610 --> 02:34:05.050]  It's easy.
[02:34:05.070 --> 02:34:06.170]  It takes minutes a day.
[02:34:06.190 --> 02:34:10.311]  You can get my films as low as $5.95.
[02:34:10.411 --> 02:34:11.852]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[02:34:11.932 --> 02:34:13.272]  Look at the great deals we've got there.
[02:34:13.292 --> 02:34:14.772]  We're call toll free.
[02:34:14.812 --> 02:34:15.873]  They can answer all your questions.
[02:34:15.893 --> 02:34:16.293]  888-253-3139.
[02:34:16.353 --> 02:34:16.533]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:34:16.573 --> 02:34:18.713]  Or PrisonPlanet.tv to get an online membership.
[02:34:26.602 --> 02:34:27.482]  I am impressed by your analysis.
[02:34:45.828 --> 02:34:54.753]  They haven't been researching it for years like you have, and then it's hard for you to then, in limited time, to be able to articulate all the facts and your reasons and what's behind it.
[02:34:54.793 --> 02:34:55.493]  But I know this.
[02:34:55.813 --> 02:34:58.215]  They did put these remote control systems on some planes.
[02:34:58.515 --> 02:35:00.856]  They did get fined $615 million.
[02:35:01.196 --> 02:35:03.938]  They are saying they're scared of prosecution for exploding doors.
[02:35:04.578 --> 02:35:09.801]  They are saying there's all sorts of things happening, and we do know they want to go to drone fleets.
[02:35:09.861 --> 02:35:14.803]  We do know they remote control those planes on 9-11, whoever did it, and that's clearly the military-industrial complex.
[02:35:14.843 --> 02:35:16.824]  Carlisle Group was our main suspect all along.
[02:35:17.104 --> 02:35:18.745]  You just add evidence to that.
[02:35:19.726 --> 02:35:24.988]  So tell us about your website, and Phil McConnell, any other comments you want to make before we go to calls?
[02:35:27.810 --> 02:35:29.691]  I would say that the HJCK,
[02:35:30.464 --> 02:35:37.088]  The transponder code that David alluded to, that's only the code that would show up on the controller's screen.
[02:35:37.228 --> 02:35:39.610]  That's not the code that goes in our end of the airplane.
[02:35:41.251 --> 02:35:44.353]  We put in numbers, and the numbers don't matter, and they're properly classified.
[02:35:44.833 --> 02:35:50.137]  But just before you go to David, I want you to know that we have very much faith in you, and we appreciate your courage, Alex.
[02:35:50.617 --> 02:35:56.381]  And if you ever want us to come down there, I'll pay the freight to get David and I down to Austin for a face-to-face visit sometime.
[02:35:57.907 --> 02:36:06.869]  Well, as this develops, maybe we can have a meeting or an event or something, but I want you to be able to stay focused on your lawsuit and what's going forward here, but this is all very important.
[02:36:08.009 --> 02:36:19.511]  Okay, and if I can just jump in, and again, I'd like to second our thanks to you, Alex, because I think your interviews and Field and myself have actually got this story across in a way that we perhaps never dreamt of at the beginning of the week.
[02:36:19.551 --> 02:36:26.753]  But anyway, as a forensic economist, what I'm particularly intrigued in are massive frauds or high-level frauds.
[02:36:27.643 --> 02:36:34.728]  I believe that you have the remedy in the United States with your RICO legislation, which was introduced in October 70.
[02:36:35.728 --> 02:36:43.213]  RICO stands for Racketeering Influence Corrupt Organization, and it has two remedies, a criminal remedy and a civil remedy.
[02:36:43.414 --> 02:36:54.541]  And Phil McConnell's legal action in the Fargo Court, the first one he's filed, is actually a claim against Boeing and ALPA, the Airline Pilots Association,
[02:36:55.251 --> 02:37:03.678]  For a civil RICO remedy for his loss of earnings as a result of what I think we both agree is his involuntary early retirement.
[02:37:03.939 --> 02:37:08.202]  Because he cannot in all conscience fly a plane when he doesn't know these elements have been removed.
[02:37:08.282 --> 02:37:10.204]  And the French benefit is discovery.
[02:37:11.509 --> 02:37:18.537]  Yes, obviously, we can subpoena witnesses, and if they don't show up in court, of course, they concede defeat.
[02:37:18.698 --> 02:37:26.988]  Now, can you imagine if Boeing concedes defeat for this relatively small case, because then the logic conclusion is, well, they accept responsibility.
[02:37:27.725 --> 02:37:38.348]  And then you can run that up to the 3,000 wrongful deaths of 9-1-1 and the massive stock exchange fraud, which we think will be the sequel to the smaller case by Phil McConnell.
[02:37:38.748 --> 02:37:51.391]  But just in case listeners imagine that we're inventing a description of Boeing as a racketeering influence corrupt organization, let me describe or read something from the Seattle Weekly of December the 1st, 2004.
[02:37:53.091 --> 02:37:54.792]  Its heading is Racket Science.
[02:37:55.032 --> 02:37:56.592]  Lockheed says in a civil suit
[02:37:57.236 --> 02:38:00.397]  That Boeing's competitive behavior constitutes racketeering.
[02:38:01.177 --> 02:38:05.099]  And it asks, is there a federal criminal racketeering case in Boeing's future?
[02:38:05.419 --> 02:38:10.121]  Attorneys for Lockheed Martin outlined that possibility in court papers filed in Florida.
[02:38:10.861 --> 02:38:19.044]  Lockheed is suing Boeing, claiming its aerospace and defense rival conspired to steal business secrets and cover up the act, allegedly a violation of the US
[02:38:21.221 --> 02:38:25.846]  And we have one of the directors going to prison and we have him paying a $615 million record fine.
[02:38:40.908 --> 02:38:52.315]  To show a 14-year pattern of illegal activity by Boeing, meaning, and I agree with Lockheed, I think Boeing has been operating as a racketeering influence and corrupt organization since 1990.
[02:38:53.216 --> 02:39:01.281]  And how, and how our government ever let its main research facilities and factories be shipped to China, that's treason.
[02:39:02.121 --> 02:39:07.645]  Well, exactly, and that was done, and everyone wants to point it at George Bush, but that was done from 1993 to 2001,
[02:39:10.478 --> 02:39:37.892]  By the Clinton administration, President of the United States number 42, and he, and I think to a certain extent his wife, authorized the transfer of America's military secrets over to the Communist Chinese, and the Communist Chinese adapted these military secrets so that they could have dual-use vehicles or weapons inside the United States that could switch from a civilian purpose to a military purpose.
[02:39:39.105 --> 02:39:48.689]  We also have Clinton signing PDD-60 that Bush has continued for a nuclear stand-down and were hit by ICBM MIRV clusters to stand down.
[02:39:49.530 --> 02:39:58.053]  Yes, and now let me just touch, if I have time, on the NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Partnership for Peace and how that works.
[02:39:58.073 --> 02:40:02.976]  This was put together by Clinton and John Shalekashvili and fast forward, on 9-1-1,
[02:40:04.505 --> 02:40:32.499]  John Shalekashvili, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was the son of Dmitry Shalekashvili, a major in the Waffen-SS, who lied when he came into the United States, was a director of Boeing, and because he was the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would know exactly to what extent the NORAD Blue Team defenses could be tricked into standing down for a Red Team NATO attack.
[02:40:35.393 --> 02:40:37.674]  Let's go ahead and go to some phone calls.
[02:40:37.734 --> 02:40:39.155]  Terry, where are you calling from today?
[02:40:41.937 --> 02:40:42.217]  Hello?
[02:40:42.737 --> 02:40:43.638]  Yes, Terry, you're on the air.
[02:40:43.658 --> 02:40:44.338]  Where are you calling from?
[02:40:44.358 --> 02:40:44.578]  Hi, Terry.
[02:40:44.759 --> 02:40:45.819]  Yeah, in Chicago.
[02:40:46.099 --> 02:40:46.580]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:40:47.700 --> 02:40:50.042]  Just a couple of comments.
[02:40:51.683 --> 02:41:03.649]  As far as people calling you guys crazy, your guests and you especially, Alex, what's incredible is that you have to be...
[02:41:05.046 --> 02:41:10.567]  From my personal experience is that you have to be perfectly sane.
[02:41:10.727 --> 02:41:14.348]  In fact, extra sane to believe what you guys are talking about.
[02:41:14.928 --> 02:41:16.369]  So I just wanted to make that comment.
[02:41:18.189 --> 02:41:33.853]  Also, as far as a few years ago, there was a space shuttle pictures that I saw in China where they have
[02:41:34.369 --> 02:41:39.832]  Basically, an exact image of Cape Canaveral built in China.
[02:41:40.092 --> 02:41:42.433]  And I was wondering if anyone can comment on that.
[02:41:42.453 --> 02:41:46.916]  Actually, could I comment on that, Alex?
[02:41:47.196 --> 02:41:47.416]  Yes.
[02:41:48.116 --> 02:41:57.541]  I can't comment on that specific picture, but run your mind back to February the 1st, 2003, when Space Shuttle Columbia came down.
[02:41:58.702 --> 02:42:00.183]  It would appear that McDonald Dept.
[02:42:00.203 --> 02:42:02.784]  Viola, the company I mentioned in British Columbia, had
[02:42:03.721 --> 02:42:31.563]  remote control activity or authority to backdoor the command and control system of the Space Shuttle Columbia and an analysis and this is from memory of reinforced carbon panel number eight shows thermite dust on the panel of the Space Shuttle Columbia when it was picked up off the ground which is consistent with this high-temperature accelerant in the wheel arch so I believe
[02:42:32.153 --> 02:42:39.336]  And there's another article on horsecafe.com that the Space Shuttle Columbia was sabotaged by these same people.
[02:42:39.936 --> 02:42:53.842]  And if you recollect the pilot, or one of the astronauts in that plane, I think it was an Israeli guy who was the youngest pilot in the attack on the Assyric reactor in Iraq in 1981.
[02:42:54.463 --> 02:42:55.923]  So they wanted to take that down.
[02:42:56.443 --> 02:42:57.784]  And he was a high value target.
[02:42:58.064 --> 02:43:00.125]  I believe they sabotaged the Space Shuttle Columbia.
[02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:03.602]  And what's your evidence of that company being connected?
[02:43:06.524 --> 02:43:24.698]  Well, McDonnell Debt Viola had a contract announced on its website, and what I looked at at McDonnell Debt Viola, I seemed to see that every time there's a terrorist attack breaking out, a few days or weeks or months before, there's a rather cryptic signal announcing an imminent terrorist attack.
[02:43:25.635 --> 02:43:30.737]  So, on the 23rd of January, and it's now been removed after I exposed it, McDonnell Dept.
[02:43:30.777 --> 02:43:45.022]  Vyler announced they'd been awarded a $150 million contract from the Johnson Space Center to operate the voltage regulation mechanisms of the wheel arch and the space shuttle and the space station.
[02:43:45.762 --> 02:43:50.824]  Now, what that means is, if you can backdoor the signals that go to the space station,
[02:43:51.708 --> 02:43:51.849]  I think?
[02:44:04.204 --> 02:44:09.188]  of Space Shuttle Columbia are consistent with a high-temperature accelerant being placed inside the wheel arch.
[02:44:09.589 --> 02:44:18.536]  Well, there was that satellite, excuse me, telescope video shot of the burning on the bottom on re-entry, and the FBI sees that.
[02:44:19.216 --> 02:44:20.277]  Thank you for the call, Terry.
[02:44:20.978 --> 02:44:21.739]  Who's up next here?
[02:44:21.759 --> 02:44:24.761]  Ian in Canada.
[02:44:24.781 --> 02:44:25.382]  You're on the air.
[02:44:26.342 --> 02:44:27.043]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:44:27.103 --> 02:44:32.247]  These last two interviews today seem to have expanded understanding of 9-11.
[02:44:33.959 --> 02:44:37.021]  Right out into outer space.
[02:44:37.121 --> 02:44:47.709]  I can confirm, just this Sunday I met with a Boeing technician and asked him about the capacity of the avionics to generate 16 turns under remote control.
[02:44:47.729 --> 02:44:48.729]  He didn't deny it.
[02:44:48.749 --> 02:44:52.112]  And I believe I phoned you a couple of years ago to tell you about a
[02:44:52.566 --> 02:44:53.467]  We're good to go.
[02:45:08.207 --> 02:45:16.596]  Yeah, but I'm just thinking now, you're talking about China being able to backdoor through iridium and control these explosive assets on commercial aircraft.
[02:45:29.034 --> 02:45:37.519]  And I thought about this story that the real target of the Chinese satellite shoot down was an American weapons platform.
[02:45:38.059 --> 02:45:47.544]  If China had that kind of control, the United States government could never acknowledge that China had actually shot down an American asset like that.
[02:45:48.265 --> 02:45:50.106]  It makes sense from the idea of
[02:45:50.686 --> 02:45:51.166]  Hello?
[02:45:51.287 --> 02:45:51.367]  Yes.
[02:45:51.387 --> 02:45:53.288]  Hello, yes, I'm calling from Iowa.
[02:45:53.308 --> 02:45:53.508]  And...
[02:46:18.126 --> 02:46:18.906]  It's hard to explain.
[02:46:18.966 --> 02:46:28.110]  I've got a new perspective on this and all of the theories that we've had about 9-11 or JFK or OKC.
[02:46:28.130 --> 02:46:29.530]  Hello?
[02:46:30.130 --> 02:46:30.390]  Yes, sir.
[02:46:30.410 --> 02:46:30.911]  You're on the air.
[02:46:30.931 --> 02:46:31.431]  Sorry.
[02:46:33.912 --> 02:46:36.713]  It is, and in effect, kind of like the controlled demolitions.
[02:46:38.013 --> 02:46:41.254]  And that I think not so much the controlled demolitions were done on purpose.
[02:46:41.354 --> 02:46:44.075]  I think they were shown to be controlled demolitions on purpose.
[02:46:44.715 --> 02:46:46.376]  I think all these conspiracy theories
[02:46:46.938 --> 02:46:49.839]  As that these details are left there on purpose.
[02:46:50.359 --> 02:46:50.639]  Why?
[02:46:50.659 --> 02:46:57.340]  To me, to think that the human curiosity equation left out is kind of naive.
[02:46:57.980 --> 02:47:02.201]  I think it's purposely led us to point so we get bogged in down into detail.
[02:47:03.101 --> 02:47:08.422]  Instead of actually, I mean, right now we have all the evidence to prove that it was an inside job.
[02:47:08.442 --> 02:47:09.922]  We already know it's an inside job.
[02:47:10.442 --> 02:47:12.223]  Yet, we haven't really done anything.
[02:47:12.723 --> 02:47:14.263]  We changed the system around us.
[02:47:14.861 --> 02:47:15.621]  But I look at this.
[02:47:15.701 --> 02:47:17.662]  What did George Bush say about the Constitution?
[02:47:19.042 --> 02:47:20.823]  Not in correct terms, but... A G.D.
[02:47:20.863 --> 02:47:21.503]  piece of paper.
[02:47:21.923 --> 02:47:22.204]  Yes!
[02:47:22.924 --> 02:47:25.865]  And that points to me in that, the whole idea of elitism.
[02:47:26.285 --> 02:47:27.645]  They don't follow our rules.
[02:47:28.686 --> 02:47:30.386]  So why are we fighting within our rules?
[02:47:30.686 --> 02:47:40.130]  They make these rules to keep us so bogged down, and so hidden, and look at so much in the details, that even if the proof that we put in their face, they stop and laugh at it like, ha ha ha ha!
[02:47:40.430 --> 02:47:41.770]  Because the general public can't get it.
[02:47:41.790 --> 02:47:43.771]  Let me get a comment from both our guests on that.
[02:47:45.188 --> 02:47:51.531]  Yes, I think that's a very shrewd observation, and I was just going to explore this NATO Partnership for Peace.
[02:47:51.571 --> 02:48:10.358]  The idea of the NATO Partnership for Peace, which was created in 1994, when Shaleh Kashfili was the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, and it was done on Clinton's instructions, was to permit any one American state, such as New York State or Pennsylvania or California,
[02:48:11.235 --> 02:48:23.400]  To, through an emergency, or a contrived emergency, to declare martial law and actually swear in the state's National Guard as NATO paramilitaries.
[02:48:23.860 --> 02:48:28.422]  Well, Bush just did that officially with the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007.
[02:48:30.423 --> 02:48:35.385]  But it was introduced in 1994 by Shalek Ashveili and... Yes, I remember.
[02:48:35.425 --> 02:48:35.985]  We've got a break.
[02:48:36.025 --> 02:48:37.266]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:48:37.346 --> 02:48:37.846]  Stay with us.
[02:48:44.393 --> 02:48:44.613]  It's here!
[02:48:44.834 --> 02:48:49.617]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:49.977 --> 02:48:57.602]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:58.314 --> 02:49:05.356]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:05.777 --> 02:49:17.180]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:17.501 --> 02:49:21.022]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:21.462 --> 02:49:23.362]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:23.723 --> 02:49:27.564]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:57.870 --> 02:51:59.391]  Let's take two final calls.
[02:51:59.691 --> 02:52:01.432]  Brett and Bob, sorry to all the others.
[02:52:02.052 --> 02:52:05.153]  Brett in Canada, you're on the air with our guest, go ahead.
[02:52:05.173 --> 02:52:08.735]  Alright Alex, good to hear from you.
[02:52:08.775 --> 02:52:10.576]  I have a great show and I think you do great things.
[02:52:13.077 --> 02:52:17.959]  So I just wanted to call it, I find it absolutely ridiculous that we have one person, we have all these people coming in,
[02:52:20.514 --> 02:52:26.137]  We have the media shut in the face of the door when we have this evidence and proof and documents right out in the open.
[02:52:26.157 --> 02:52:37.982]  I just wanted to say that I really admire that you put your foot out and try to get this information out at the same time when people are calling you crazy and everything.
[02:52:38.522 --> 02:52:40.043]  It's a sad world these days.
[02:52:41.043 --> 02:52:44.945]  I just wanted to say that I think you're doing a really great job and I'm really admiring you for
[02:52:47.249 --> 02:52:49.630]  Well, I mean, regardless, they think there's a problem.
[02:52:49.650 --> 02:52:55.011]  There is a problem with not getting clear answers about these remote control chips and exploding doors.
[02:52:56.471 --> 02:52:59.512]  Have you found any authorization they got for having exploding doors?
[02:52:59.552 --> 02:53:04.413]  Because from this engineer's comments, it sounds like at Boeing, he's saying they're not allowed to have that.
[02:53:05.633 --> 02:53:07.254]  I think the, is this a question to me?
[02:53:07.874 --> 02:53:08.094]  Yes.
[02:53:08.534 --> 02:53:08.734]  Yeah.
[02:53:09.114 --> 02:53:12.735]  Now, very interestingly, the Boeing guy, Bain, said,
[02:53:13.510 --> 02:53:18.434]  An almost explicit prohibition of the Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco and Firearms.
[02:53:18.494 --> 02:53:23.098]  Now, I think Field mentioned yesterday they've dropped the E from B-A-T-F.
[02:53:23.118 --> 02:53:26.401]  It used to be B-A-T-F-E, meaning explosives.
[02:53:27.602 --> 02:53:37.991]  And the people who should have prohibited and made sure that explosives didn't get on board the Boeings would be agents of the Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives.
[02:53:38.641 --> 02:53:40.262]  In the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City.
[02:53:55.731 --> 02:53:55.951]  Really?
[02:54:17.731 --> 02:54:18.972]  All right, final call.
[02:54:19.052 --> 02:54:20.593]  Bob in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:54:20.633 --> 02:54:21.053]  Go ahead.
[02:54:21.794 --> 02:54:22.594]  Greetings, gentlemen.
[02:54:22.855 --> 02:54:25.676]  This thing is snowballing and creating an avalanche.
[02:54:25.716 --> 02:54:47.471]  A few questions I have is that Don Grand Dupree said these systems, these fly-by-wire override systems had been in place before 9-11, and also the fact of well-documented aircraft sabotage and the possible connection with the Inslaw Promise software, how if anybody could track an aircraft or a person on an aircraft,
[02:54:48.075 --> 02:54:48.675]  Yes, I believe that
[02:55:13.334 --> 02:55:23.848]  The company I just mentioned has a software package called Mindbox, which is actually readjusting the insurance on targeted aircraft and buildings in real time.
[02:55:23.888 --> 02:55:26.191]  It actually takes 15 seconds to refresh.
[02:55:26.832 --> 02:55:31.478]  So when a target has been hijacked electronically and is heading towards its physical target,
[02:55:32.239 --> 02:55:38.768]  Both the building and the vehicle are being reinsured through McDonnell, Detweiler and Carlyle Canada in real time.
[02:55:38.988 --> 02:55:39.869]  Alright, we're out of time.
[02:55:39.909 --> 02:55:43.334]  Gentlemen, I want to thank David Hoggings for joining us and Captain Field McDonnell.
[02:55:43.634 --> 02:55:44.736]  We'll talk to you soon, gentlemen.
[02:55:45.156 --> 02:55:45.937]  Thank you very much.
[02:55:46.358 --> 02:55:46.738]  Take care.
[02:55:47.299 --> 02:55:50.461]  Folks, all I know is they have this remote control technology.
[02:55:50.881 --> 02:55:52.122]  They've been fined over it.
[02:55:52.442 --> 02:55:53.723]  There are exploding doors.
[02:55:53.903 --> 02:55:55.564]  I don't know how much the rest of it's true.
[02:55:55.904 --> 02:55:58.585]  But it's an important story when it shows up in the mainstream media.
[02:55:58.906 --> 02:56:02.788]  And this other story out of England about how they can remote control things on Sunday.
[02:56:03.128 --> 02:56:03.888]  So we've covered it.
[02:56:03.988 --> 02:56:05.449]  We've fleshed it out.
[02:56:06.190 --> 02:56:07.370]  We'll continue to research it.
[02:56:07.490 --> 02:56:09.451]  Huge story up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:09.832 --> 02:56:11.012]  Part 1's up there right now.
[02:56:11.032 --> 02:56:11.893]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:56:12.713 --> 02:56:14.274]  Part 2 tonight.
[02:56:14.774 --> 02:56:15.875]  Get it out to everybody.
[02:56:16.670 --> 02:56:18.412]  Let's get it out there and all look at it.
[02:56:18.452 --> 02:56:19.212]  God bless you all.
