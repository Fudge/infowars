[00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:09.707]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.348 --> 00:00:11.168]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:12.889]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.153]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:21.756]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:42.727]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:45.167]  Welcome to another live edition.
[00:00:45.187 --> 00:00:49.288]  We're here every Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:50.248]  until 2 p.m.
[00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.310]  Central Standard Time, right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:05.717]  The network itself retransmits the broadcast over the satellites, internet, and shortwave from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:01:05.757 --> 00:01:06.558]  That's 10 to 1 a.m.
[00:01:06.578 --> 00:01:07.459]  Eastern.
[00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:17.935]  And of course at InfoWars.com we restream the show consecutively 21 hours a day until the next live transmission begins.
[00:01:17.975 --> 00:01:20.717]  You can tune in when you want, where you want, how you want.
[00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:30.805]  You can also subscribe to the free podcast at InfoWars.com and have that downloaded for free for your MP3 or iPod device on a daily basis.
[00:01:34.708 --> 00:01:36.529]  Big News Day today!
[00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:45.264]  Scores of economists, mainstream newspapers, television is talking about a Great Depression.
[00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:56.688]  And I assure you that the mainstream media would not be running with this unless they'd gotten the orders from higher up that it was okay to go with the reality.
[00:01:57.548 --> 00:02:03.410]  And unless there was an attempt by the establishment to further implode the economy so they can criminally consolidate.
[00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:06.152]  And that is certainly what's happening.
[00:02:06.212 --> 00:02:12.916]  So I want to get more into the Globalist Master Plan with the economy and what I think is going to unfold in the next year.
[00:02:12.956 --> 00:02:16.358]  We've talked a lot about what they're setting up, what they're doing, what currently is happening.
[00:02:16.878 --> 00:02:28.385]  But looking forward, I've been asking all these economists and experts and stock traders and people we've had on and Nobel Prize winners and the father of economics and others to give us their take.
[00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:32.508]  Well, I'm here to give you my take later on in the second hour today.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.561]  There's some good news.
[00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:39.105]  A federal judge rules two Patriot Act provisions are unconstitutional.
[00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:48.493]  The problem is, when other judges have ruled similarly, Bush just goes to Congress and has them pass unconstitutional laws, and then Bush claims veto power over the courts.
[00:02:50.334 --> 00:02:55.279]  Which, quite frankly, he has to a certain extent.
[00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:57.741]  But not when it is this flagrant.
[00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:00.323]  The three branches are meant to be at each other's throats.
[00:03:01.144 --> 00:03:06.747]  Clearly, the Presidency, though, the Executive, has gotten way too powerful and is out of its purview and needs to be reined in.
[00:03:07.247 --> 00:03:09.508]  So, we'll go over that today.
[00:03:09.528 --> 00:03:13.570]  And, of course, I mentioned the economic news.
[00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.071]  Here's just some of it I have in front of me.
[00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:17.192]  Home sales prices continue to fall.
[00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:20.714]  Price drops accelerated in July, the steepest rate in 16 years.
[00:03:21.194 --> 00:03:23.075]  You're going, wait a minute, it's September, about to be October.
[00:03:23.095 --> 00:03:24.395]  What are you giving us July's numbers?
[00:03:25.136 --> 00:03:27.397]  Housing numbers are generally two to three months behind.
[00:03:28.044 --> 00:03:30.126]  So a lot of times, other statistics are years behind.
[00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:32.508]  You'll hear me talk about the census, that's 2000.
[00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:43.157]  You'll hear me talk about troop death numbers, and they only come out once a year, basically, so we've got nine-month-old numbers.
[00:03:43.197 --> 00:03:45.399]  I mean, it's just, that's the nature of the beast.
[00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.342]  And then, a week later, you'll hear me with some new, bigger number, and that's because the new numbers have come out.
[00:03:50.993 --> 00:03:55.194]  There's been attempts at debunking by debunkers that fool the weak-minded public.
[00:03:55.614 --> 00:04:04.157]  They'll take a two-year-old show I did where I say there's been 47 million abortions, and they'll cut it in with me saying there's been 50-plus million, and they go, look at the liar!
[00:04:04.957 --> 00:04:07.658]  No, time goes by!
[00:04:09.438 --> 00:04:10.698]  Time goes by.
[00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.100]  But the tricks they play on people are pretty juvenile, but it seems to work on some.
[00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.049]  U.S.
[00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.652]  economy, durable goods orders declined in August.
[00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:23.273]  We'll get into those numbers.
[00:04:23.313 --> 00:04:24.114]  Those just came out.
[00:04:25.935 --> 00:04:28.157]  Generals are revolting at an alarming rate.
[00:04:28.237 --> 00:04:31.919]  Never in history have generals revolted against a war like they are now in Iraq.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.001]  And that's our top story when we get back.
[00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:40.625]  Remember Saddam Hussein was given the offer a week before the invasion to leave the country?
[00:04:42.887 --> 00:04:44.488]  Well, there's been a big development.
[00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:46.710]  He offered to leave and
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.002]  They said no.
[00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:51.288]  It's huge.
[00:04:51.468 --> 00:04:55.598]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:57.022]  We'll come back and cover it.
[00:05:01.098 --> 00:05:06.179]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:13.561]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:24.343]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:05:24.543 --> 00:05:29.084]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:05:29.364 --> 00:05:34.347]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:37.489]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:47.534]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:52.537]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:25.288]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.308 --> 00:06:37.092]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.432 --> 00:06:40.993]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.393 --> 00:06:43.294]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:47.435]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:01.728 --> 00:07:06.092]  The Digestive Tract, a natural waste factory built within all of our bodies.
[00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:11.497]  Roughly 25 feet of tunnels designed to absorb nutrition and then dispel the waste.
[00:07:11.897 --> 00:07:13.779]  But what happens when the waste gets clogged up?
[00:07:14.503 --> 00:07:21.507]  More than 4 million Americans have frequent constipation, accounting for 2.5 million physician visits a year.
[00:07:21.967 --> 00:07:26.910]  Now there's AlloCleanse, an all-natural formula based on herbs and safe enzymes.
[00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:32.614]  AlloCleanse gently sweeps the entire digestive tract and supports comfortable regular bathroom habits.
[00:07:32.774 --> 00:07:39.078]  You'll feel lighter, and you'll feel clean inside, and when you remove the waste buildup with AlloCleanse, you'll have more energy.
[00:07:39.358 --> 00:07:42.960]  Energy to use on other things, besides worrying about constipation.
[00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:48.304]  For a risk-free trial of Allocleanse, call 1-800-890-3525.

[00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.752]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:57.833]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.871]  Alright, strap yourselves in.
[00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:31.787]  We're about to plunge directly into massive news on the war front, the economy, the biomedical warfare attacks against the population of the planet, police going completely wild, getting caught all over the country on video and getting fired, and then stalking the people that videotaped them.
[00:08:33.068 --> 00:08:35.130]  It's all in the news today.
[00:08:38.715 --> 00:09:02.806]  But I did want to remind the listeners that in-game, my masterpiece, the Globalist Master Plan, if you want to understand who the New World Order are, how they operate, what their plans are, and what their final goal is, the extermination of 80% of the population, that matter if you're black or white or hispanic or a cop or a school teacher, we're all in this together, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:06.227 --> 00:09:07.548]  In-game, the movie.
[00:09:08.366 --> 00:09:10.730]  InGameTheMovie.com.
[00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.273]  What is the InGame.com?
[00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:18.701]  You can find links to them up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:19.242 --> 00:09:22.787]  The two domain names point to the same site.
[00:09:23.493 --> 00:09:29.194]  Run by Kurt Nemo in association with Aaron Dykes who's putting the big history section in there in the next couple weeks.
[00:09:29.254 --> 00:09:32.315]  It's got a bunch of thumbnail images from the film.
[00:09:32.755 --> 00:09:34.936]  It's got three different trailers up there.
[00:09:34.976 --> 00:09:37.496]  Two of them new that were just released yesterday.
[00:09:37.517 --> 00:09:47.519]  And the reason you want to go to whatistheendgame.com and endgamethemovie.com is because you can watch the three trailers on YouTube.
[00:09:49.128 --> 00:09:54.751]  But if you go to the actual website, we have it off our new content distribution servers.
[00:09:55.051 --> 00:10:04.156]  You can see it in the type of quality, we're talking television quality, it's unbelievably crisp, that you're going to be able to watch it as PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:10:04.336 --> 00:10:12.421]  So go watch the trailers right there at WhatIsTheEndGame.com and EndGameTheMovie.com.
[00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:15.863]  Paul Watson wrote an article yesterday that happened to have the new trailers in it.
[00:10:16.463 --> 00:10:19.104]  If human beings are a virus, then what is the endgame?
[00:10:19.444 --> 00:10:24.806]  You can also find that article on PrisonPlanet.com and get over to the trailers right there as well.
[00:10:24.866 --> 00:10:33.570]  In fact, I need to tell my webmasters to get just direct links to the new website so people don't have to search around to find it, because you'll get home tonight and go, what was that domain?
[00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:38.812]  I mean, we've been building it for weeks, and I've got to go, wait, wait, what are those new domain names?
[00:10:40.612 --> 00:10:41.012]  Okay.
[00:10:43.493 --> 00:10:44.654]  There is just so much here.
[00:10:45.666 --> 00:10:49.229]  Saddam offered exile, but neocons unleashed carnage anyway.
[00:10:49.809 --> 00:10:51.771]  What could have been saved?
[00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:52.711]  A trillion dollars?
[00:10:53.252 --> 00:10:54.133]  A million lives?
[00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:56.354]  The global reputation of the U.S.?
[00:10:57.495 --> 00:10:59.036]  But that wasn't the plan, was it?
[00:11:00.597 --> 00:11:01.318]  Then I have this.
[00:11:01.518 --> 00:11:05.301]  Deaths associated with HPV vaccine start rolling in.
[00:11:05.321 --> 00:11:07.162]  Over 3,500 adverse effects reported.
[00:11:12.466 --> 00:11:16.527]  Now they've only been out a couple months and they've admitted three deaths and over 1,500.
[00:11:17.207 --> 00:11:20.288]  And it's been out now for nine months.
[00:11:21.628 --> 00:11:32.450]  In just a couple months there were that many and with a new drug, this is an official guesstimation, this is what they teach at medical school, and you can ask any nurse who knows these numbers, they can tell you.
[00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.331]  You can go check it for yourself.
[00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:39.192]  But around one in a hundred adverse reactions with a new drug get reported.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.620]  New product, medical product.
[00:11:41.761 --> 00:11:48.442]  You can't call a live virus that goes into the body a drug, really, I guess.
[00:11:49.443 --> 00:11:53.144]  A augmentation, an alteration in your genetic code, there.
[00:11:53.184 --> 00:11:54.064]  We'll put it that way.
[00:11:54.644 --> 00:11:59.525]  Live, already formed, post-natal genetic engineering.
[00:12:01.246 --> 00:12:06.227]  Anything post-zygote is a disaster, but c'est la vie!
[00:12:06.867 --> 00:12:07.708]  Bonne voyage!
[00:12:08.068 --> 00:12:08.668]  Sayonara!
[00:12:09.597 --> 00:12:12.238]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:12:12.859 --> 00:12:14.180]  Also, U.S.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.321]  nuclear weapons being guarded by Israel.
[00:12:16.341 --> 00:12:21.964]  Now, I've known this for years, but I saw it in a news report and I thought I'd go over that.
[00:12:22.104 --> 00:12:22.764]  Also, U.S.
[00:12:22.804 --> 00:12:23.605]  killer snipers.
[00:12:23.625 --> 00:12:24.805]  This is out of the Washington Post.
[00:12:25.666 --> 00:12:26.726]  Monday, September 24th.
[00:12:26.786 --> 00:12:29.027]  I missed this a few days ago.
[00:12:30.188 --> 00:12:31.729]  And it says they actually put out
[00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:46.293]  Detonation cord, what looks like explosives, but what the general public, like the average person in Austin, Texas, or Houston, Texas, or New York City, saw detonation cord and explosives laying on the ground, you wouldn't know what they were.
[00:12:49.274 --> 00:12:50.874]  Anybody picks it up, they grease them.
[00:12:51.894 --> 00:12:52.054]  Ha!
[00:12:52.975 --> 00:12:54.095]  That's quite a system.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.341]  By the way, those kills won't help the insurgency.
[00:12:58.361 --> 00:12:59.302]  And the Pentagon knows that.
[00:12:59.662 --> 00:13:00.582]  Killing innocent people.
[00:13:00.622 --> 00:13:02.163]  Now the troops think they're fighting the insurgency.
[00:13:02.203 --> 00:13:03.824]  They're like the general public.
[00:13:03.844 --> 00:13:04.304]  They don't know.
[00:13:05.244 --> 00:13:08.306]  They don't understand that it's actually meant to break the country down even more.
[00:13:08.366 --> 00:13:10.827]  It's designed to create resistance.
[00:13:11.907 --> 00:13:20.531]  So every innocent person you blast troops, you produce on average, according to Pentagon's own studies, more than three people.
[00:13:21.494 --> 00:13:23.435]  Comes out to three point something, I forget the exact number.
[00:13:23.975 --> 00:13:28.976]  So, that's not a very good move, but the Pentagon knows that.
[00:13:29.316 --> 00:13:34.118]  In the P-2-O-G plan, written in 2000, six billion dollars of funding a year since then.
[00:13:35.538 --> 00:13:36.338]  What's six billion?
[00:13:36.478 --> 00:13:41.360]  2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, in five years, five times six billion.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.721]  Ooh, we're talking about quite a bit.
[00:13:46.981 --> 00:13:48.602]  Thirty billion dollars.
[00:13:49.426 --> 00:13:52.307]  To direct programs to make the Arabs fight us.
[00:13:53.848 --> 00:13:56.308]  That's a lot of cash to stir them up.
[00:13:56.949 --> 00:14:05.331]  And with it, you get training for the foolish snipers, which they think is... I said I'd just mention the news, I'm already getting into it.
[00:14:05.351 --> 00:14:09.513]  73,000 dead U.S.
[00:14:10.013 --> 00:14:12.114]  troops in Iraq story, a complete hoax.
[00:14:13.294 --> 00:14:15.855]  And I really have to say, the guy that puts all these reports out,
[00:14:16.641 --> 00:14:18.462]  That other people just keep picking up on.
[00:14:18.482 --> 00:14:23.443]  I don't normally spend my time debunking people that are wrong, but it's obviously on purpose.
[00:14:24.724 --> 00:14:46.211]  I mean, even after a few months ago the guy put out a report that there were Amaro coins being printed by the Mint, and then the companies online that sells them as a way to illustrate how evil the Amaro is, because it, you know, the coin has symbols of the police state on it, and then even after the person was contacted to go, these are not official Amaro coins, they said, yes they are!
[00:14:48.746 --> 00:14:52.047]  73,000 Gulf War vets from Gulf War II have died.
[00:14:53.207 --> 00:14:59.108]  Of the close to a million people that have been rotated, not just through Iraq, but in the military period.
[00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:01.349]  Veterans since that point have died.
[00:15:04.049 --> 00:15:06.810]  And the spin is that they died in Iraq.
[00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:07.610]  That is not true.
[00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:12.131]  And what happens with these straw men is, disinfo is put out, then it'll be blamed on me.
[00:15:12.151 --> 00:15:13.571]  It'll be blamed on you.
[00:15:14.614 --> 00:15:21.258]  When you're in a message board somewhere and trying to post something, they'll go, oh, you're the guys that say 73,000 troops died!
[00:15:21.278 --> 00:15:22.078]  You're the liars!
[00:15:22.698 --> 00:15:25.520]  You're the guys that say holograms hit the World Trade Centers!
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.202]  You're the guys that say Mickey Mouse controls the planet from Pluto!
[00:15:29.882 --> 00:15:32.584]  You're, you're the, see, that's straw man attacks.
[00:15:32.744 --> 00:15:34.805]  Oh, you're the guys that say space beams did it!
[00:15:36.866 --> 00:15:40.588]  I was reading through Digg comments yesterday, because I usually get so many tips and links to
[00:15:41.574 --> 00:15:43.895]  Good information there, but I also get to read the detractors.
[00:15:44.455 --> 00:15:49.117]  And it's Alex Jones said we were going to have a depression by September 21st.
[00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:53.279]  He said there were record put options, and he said we were going to be in a depression.
[00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:57.568]  We probably wrote, what, 10-12 articles on that in the months leading up.
[00:15:58.008 --> 00:16:00.350]  We picked up on it from the Dow Jones News.
[00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:10.716]  We said that we didn't know it was going to happen, that it was called a Bin Laden trade, and that if the market didn't go down by 30% in Europe, that these individuals would lose billions.
[00:16:10.876 --> 00:16:11.456]  And they did!
[00:16:12.177 --> 00:16:16.439]  The market went down, so they didn't completely lose their hind ends, but it didn't go down by 30% in Europe.
[00:16:16.459 --> 00:16:19.881]  It went down by, what, overall about 15%?
[00:16:21.337 --> 00:16:24.339]  But in the bank stocks they went down about 30 percent, in some cases more.
[00:16:25.259 --> 00:16:35.686]  Northern Rock went down by almost 40, but I just reported on what the Dow Jones Newswire said, and we didn't say that, and we put in the articles people are saying this.
[00:16:37.427 --> 00:16:39.648]  And we put articles saying it was being exaggerated.
[00:16:40.329 --> 00:16:45.592]  But see, when they're done with me, I'm the progenitor of that, not Dow Jones.
[00:16:45.972 --> 00:16:47.633]  I'm the person where that came from.
[00:16:48.948 --> 00:16:51.954]  Then again, I'm going over enemy disinfo so you learn how to recognize it.
[00:16:51.974 --> 00:16:58.526]  I've had so many emails and requests and on the PrisonPlanet.com forum they've asked me to do whole shows on it, and I may do that.
[00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:03.723]  You've got to be very delicate about disinfo, because if you mention disinfo, that's what they want.
[00:17:03.763 --> 00:17:04.584]  It's a tar baby.
[00:17:04.944 --> 00:17:08.788]  You can't specifically mention who's putting out the disinfo, because that then gives them attention.
[00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.410]  You have to inoculate the public, and I mean that in a good way.
[00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.234]  It has a bad connotation, that term today, semantically, but I mean in a good way.
[00:17:15.514 --> 00:17:20.019]  You have to psychologically and mentally, with facts and evidence.
[00:17:21.323 --> 00:17:21.903]  We're good to go.
[00:17:44.503 --> 00:17:51.406]  And we have the highly motivated individuals who love liberty and freedom and who have a spirit of stewardship and of the guardian.
[00:17:52.586 --> 00:17:57.268]  And more and more I realize that's what life is really all about, is to be a nurturative person who builds others up.
[00:17:57.629 --> 00:18:05.312]  I've always taken pleasure in it, and I've never understood why others take pleasure in tearing others down, but that that's the spirit of losers.
[00:18:07.296 --> 00:18:08.637]  And even the New World Order are losers.
[00:18:08.677 --> 00:18:13.862]  They have great power and they've gotten into positions, but they are losing out on what it is to truly be human beings.
[00:18:14.082 --> 00:18:16.444]  I've also learned to isolate myself from losers.
[00:18:16.484 --> 00:18:17.986]  I no longer associate with losers.
[00:18:18.466 --> 00:18:23.550]  If somebody around me shows evidences of being a loser, I immediately disassociate.
[00:18:24.932 --> 00:18:26.813]  But we should all do that, by the way.
[00:18:27.454 --> 00:18:30.156]  Unless they're your family, then with your family you've got to stick it out and help them.
[00:18:31.197 --> 00:18:34.320]  But good people put up with baloney far too long.
[00:18:35.223 --> 00:18:43.310]  And I've just gotten to the point where I just don't... Why should I, if somebody's being mean to me or doing bad things to me, rationalize it or put up with it?
[00:18:43.951 --> 00:18:45.833]  Same thing with bad cops, bad government.
[00:18:46.493 --> 00:18:48.415]  Why should good cops put up with bad cops?
[00:18:48.495 --> 00:18:51.618]  Why should good city workers put up with bad city workers?
[00:18:52.098 --> 00:18:55.721]  Why should we put up with their culture of corruption dominating us?
[00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:57.203]  I say it stops.
[00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.132]  Okay, that's not even one-tenth of the news I've got here.
[00:19:02.232 --> 00:19:03.492]  It's all off the chart today.
[00:19:03.833 --> 00:19:07.855]  Here's the big story of the day, and this should become a massive story.
[00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:08.616]  It probably won't.
[00:19:09.396 --> 00:19:11.057]  This is bigger than the Downing Street memo.
[00:19:11.117 --> 00:19:12.498]  It's bigger than the White House memo.
[00:19:12.558 --> 00:19:18.122]  It's bigger than Treasury Secretary O'Neill saying within five days of Bush being in office, he was in the
[00:19:19.128 --> 00:19:32.033]  Uh, Maine, uh, what the offices, the larger annex room next, uh, there in the East Wing with the Vice President, with the President with huge maps about how they were going to attack Iraq and claiming he was a dictator.
[00:19:32.533 --> 00:19:40.416]  It's bigger than the Vice President writing in PNAC documents September 2000 saying that Saddam isn't a threat.
[00:19:41.716 --> 00:19:42.997]  Admitting, no, no, this is bigger.
[00:19:43.237 --> 00:19:43.937]  This is huge.
[00:19:45.318 --> 00:19:46.478]  Saddam tried to give up.
[00:19:47.168 --> 00:19:50.133]  And they said, no way, Jose.
[00:19:50.153 --> 00:19:55.581]  How else are we gonna tear your country to pieces and exterminate your people?
[00:19:56.162 --> 00:19:58.085]  This is genocide, I reckon!
[00:20:01.457 --> 00:20:04.478]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:20:04.798 --> 00:20:09.721]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:20:09.981 --> 00:20:14.322]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:20:14.623 --> 00:20:23.526]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:20:23.746 --> 00:20:27.368]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:20:27.668 --> 00:20:32.671]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:20:32.972 --> 00:20:39.716]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:20:40.196 --> 00:20:40.737]  What about you?
[00:20:41.503 --> 00:20:49.388]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:22:02.685 --> 00:22:04.747]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:05.368 --> 00:22:14.297]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.757 --> 00:22:21.945]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.663 --> 00:22:26.525]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMed Inc.'

[00:23:01.678 --> 00:23:04.600]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:09.924]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:23:10.284 --> 00:23:15.568]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:23:16.008 --> 00:23:17.129]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:26.396]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:23:26.796 --> 00:23:28.417]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.

[00:24:16.514 --> 00:24:18.315]  We'll die for the system.
[00:24:18.395 --> 00:24:22.979]  A little piece of you.
[00:24:22.999 --> 00:24:24.179]  A little piece of me.
[00:24:45.386 --> 00:24:52.772]  Huge off the charts news, red alert ladies and gentlemen, it was Gary Hart that triggered me to issue the warning.
[00:24:53.233 --> 00:25:10.767]  By the way, I was looking at it last night on YouTube and did you know that the full clip of me warning about Bin Laden, it was a two and a half hour TV show back then in the summer of 2001, I was doing a two and a half hour TV show once a week and it's a
[00:25:11.966 --> 00:25:14.008]  It's on a three hour tape somewhere around here in the office.
[00:25:14.028 --> 00:25:15.088]  There's thousands of tapes here.
[00:25:15.729 --> 00:25:18.130]  But we took the main body of it and put it in Masters of Terror.
[00:25:18.471 --> 00:25:23.214]  And I said they'll probably attack the World Trade Center and blame it on their CIA asset Bin Laden.
[00:25:25.175 --> 00:25:26.876]  And then I went on to describe it in more detail.
[00:25:27.637 --> 00:25:30.599]  Whoever grabbed it and put it up there didn't even put the whole clip up!
[00:25:31.579 --> 00:25:33.801]  It's got hundreds of thousands of views per upload.
[00:25:33.821 --> 00:25:35.062]  There's a bunch of versions.
[00:25:35.582 --> 00:25:37.023]  And it's all these different edits of it.
[00:25:37.504 --> 00:25:41.987]  So as soon as Aaron gets in, and he was here late last night, I'm going to have him get Masters of Terror, because I put it in there.
[00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:43.008]  I'm going to have the whole thing.
[00:25:43.028 --> 00:25:46.651]  You know, the part we put in the film, up there, where I predicted 9-11.
[00:25:46.911 --> 00:25:48.693]  But it was hundreds of reasons.
[00:25:48.773 --> 00:25:50.114]  And other people picked up on it, too.
[00:25:50.574 --> 00:26:00.101]  I mean, Gary Hart, Warren Rudman, Hart-Rudman Commission, CFR panel that recommended Homeland Security, 51 points, all of them adopted before 9-11.
[00:26:01.903 --> 00:26:05.667]  Gave speeches with Clinton in 1993, calling for a Department of Homeland Security.
[00:26:05.707 --> 00:26:06.708]  I mean, this is not Bush.
[00:26:06.748 --> 00:26:07.568]  He's a puppet, folks.
[00:26:07.689 --> 00:26:09.630]  It's an ongoing global order agenda.
[00:26:11.812 --> 00:26:15.436]  The last straw was July 23rd.
[00:26:15.716 --> 00:26:17.458]  You can go pull that up off Hardball.
[00:26:17.478 --> 00:26:18.539]  I believe it was a few days before.
[00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:19.399]  I'm saying the 23rd.
[00:26:19.459 --> 00:26:19.980]  Right around there.
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:20.921]  One of those shows.
[00:26:21.986 --> 00:26:49.934]  And I'd already seen them introduce Bin Laden, he's gonna get you, he's gonna attack you, he's gonna kill you, he's evil, oh my gosh, you have to give up all your rights when we get attacked, and I saw all the news, all the papers, and I knew the FBI'd cook the bomb, train the driver, bomb the World Trade Center the first time, and I just put it all together, because then I was watching Hardball with Chris Matthews, he had Warren Rudman and Gary Hart on, and Gary Hart was on there talking, and I'd never seen Chris Matthews, and I used to watch TV for like an hour every night on a stair-stepper,
[00:26:50.811 --> 00:26:54.074]  I just quit watching TV basically after that point, except for films and stuff.
[00:26:54.594 --> 00:26:55.435]  I just couldn't stand it.
[00:26:56.596 --> 00:26:58.377]  But back then I watched a lot of TV still.
[00:26:59.038 --> 00:27:06.224]  And Matthew, who's a definite insider, said, I want to thank you for doing this on my show, announcing this.
[00:27:07.385 --> 00:27:08.505]  And I was going, this is weird.
[00:27:08.525 --> 00:27:12.849]  And they were acting real giddy, like schoolgirls, and giggling and slapping each other on the knees.
[00:27:12.889 --> 00:27:15.451]  They were all sitting, you know how in hardball they sit close to each other?
[00:27:19.654 --> 00:27:23.637]  All of a sudden, they said, yeah, there's going to be big changes, big terror attacks, big buildings.
[00:27:23.677 --> 00:27:24.518]  They started laughing.
[00:27:24.978 --> 00:27:26.079]  Yeah, there's going to be troops.
[00:27:26.639 --> 00:27:29.401]  And they were giggling and laughing and winking and smiling.
[00:27:29.421 --> 00:27:31.142]  I went, these are, this is bragging.
[00:27:31.803 --> 00:27:34.465]  And my girlfriend was over and I just freaked out.
[00:27:34.505 --> 00:27:36.026]  I said, baby, baby.
[00:27:36.927 --> 00:27:38.988]  I said, oh my God, I got to remember to tape this tonight.
[00:27:39.008 --> 00:27:39.649]  Of course I didn't.
[00:27:40.089 --> 00:27:40.649]  I said, that's it.
[00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:41.250]  They're going to do it.
[00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:41.730]  They're going to do it.
[00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:42.851]  She's like, what are you talking about?
[00:27:43.091 --> 00:27:44.712]  This is seven years ago or six years ago.
[00:27:45.133 --> 00:27:46.413]  And I said, they're going to hit.
[00:27:46.433 --> 00:27:47.074]  They're going to hit.
[00:27:47.534 --> 00:27:47.995]  That's it.
[00:27:48.055 --> 00:27:48.455]  It's over.
[00:27:50.166 --> 00:27:54.548]  And I went on air the next day or the day after that and I just, I just, it all fell in place.
[00:27:56.209 --> 00:28:17.238]  He loves to brag beforehand, ladies and gentlemen, I am holding from the Huffington Post, it's also been picked up by other news wires, a letter by Gary Hart that he has put out to the media, unsolicited advice to the government of Iran, a letter from Gary Hart
[00:28:18.346 --> 00:28:20.008]  To the government of Iran.
[00:28:20.048 --> 00:28:24.892]  I said we were coming back with the top story about Saddam, which is huge, trying to give up and they wouldn't let him.
[00:28:26.853 --> 00:28:27.894]  This is so big.
[00:28:29.075 --> 00:28:31.997]  Tim works here in the office in customer service, does a fabulous job.
[00:28:32.017 --> 00:28:33.318]  That's why we've got good customer service.
[00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:36.181]  At least it's heaven and hell comparison.
[00:28:36.201 --> 00:28:38.443]  Heaven now, hell before, compared to what we used to have.
[00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:39.564]  It's getting really good.
[00:28:41.827 --> 00:28:44.868]  Tim, smart guy, walked over and he goes, tell me what you think of this.
[00:28:44.908 --> 00:28:51.831]  And I read one line and I went, oh my, I literally almost staggered up against the wall and I started saying, that's it, that's it.
[00:28:52.692 --> 00:28:53.872]  Hart's done it again, folks.
[00:28:54.413 --> 00:28:55.553]  This is bad news.
[00:28:56.574 --> 00:28:59.575]  Because he only pops up to say stuff when we are in deep trouble.
[00:29:01.816 --> 00:29:04.577]  And, oh my gosh, this is off the charts.
[00:29:06.058 --> 00:29:06.418]  It's just...
[00:29:07.077 --> 00:29:08.178]  I know I say that all the time.
[00:29:08.218 --> 00:29:09.398]  Go listen to shows two years ago.
[00:29:09.418 --> 00:29:10.139]  I never talk like that.
[00:29:10.179 --> 00:29:10.979]  It's every day.
[00:29:11.419 --> 00:29:12.320]  Everything's speeding up.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:13.000]  It's a quickening.
[00:29:15.061 --> 00:29:16.302]  When we get back, I'll tell you what he said.
[00:29:16.322 --> 00:29:18.463]  We're getting this up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:29:19.303 --> 00:29:22.465]  And I've told Paul and Steven and Ryan Slick Eisen and Infowars.com.
[00:29:22.485 --> 00:29:23.245]  This is red level.
[00:29:25.106 --> 00:29:27.568]  He flat out comes right out with a double meaning.
[00:29:28.248 --> 00:29:35.832]  This is Hart's M.O., his signature, his attack pattern, his modus operandi.
[00:29:37.259 --> 00:29:37.799]  This is it.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:39.620]  This is it.
[00:29:42.202 --> 00:29:43.743]  I just hope it's bravado.
[00:29:44.223 --> 00:29:44.903]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:44.943 --> 00:29:46.244]  We'll tell you what he said when we get back.
[00:29:51.947 --> 00:29:52.948]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.328 --> 00:29:54.949]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.849 --> 00:29:58.571]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.151 --> 00:30:03.332]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:30:03.412 --> 00:30:05.714]  I'm the Nuptramedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:30:05.854 --> 00:30:08.816]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:30:08.876 --> 00:30:09.536]  is a real thing.
[00:30:09.636 --> 00:30:16.541]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:21.925]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:30:22.085 --> 00:30:22.845]  We're good to go!
[00:30:48.831 --> 00:30:50.352]  Are you tired of frequent urination?
[00:30:50.392 --> 00:30:52.873]  Do you drink a ton of water and still feel thirsty?
[00:30:52.933 --> 00:30:55.815]  The quantity of water you drink is not the key to hydration.
[00:30:55.835 --> 00:30:57.936]  The key to hydration is the correct clustering of water.
[00:30:57.956 --> 00:31:01.519]  When water has the ideal cluster, your cells will readily absorb it.
[00:31:17.628 --> 00:31:18.509]  We're good to go.
[00:31:42.762 --> 00:31:43.123]  I think so.
[00:32:03.681 --> 00:32:11.843]  So you've decided to make the switch to a healthier lifestyle, eating more organic fruits and vegetables, staying away from unhealthy snacking, and cutting out dangerous salts from your diet.

[00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:23.754]  Day after day Alone on a hill The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still But nobody wants to know him They can see that he's just a fool
[00:33:25.918 --> 00:33:42.689]  Alright, we're getting into this huge news with Gary Hart.
[00:33:42.809 --> 00:33:46.652]  The offer for Saddam also to leave was of course staged.
[00:33:46.672 --> 00:33:49.394]  That was later admitted, but he offered to leave and they said no.
[00:33:49.874 --> 00:33:50.995]  We'll give you details on that.
[00:33:51.015 --> 00:33:52.015]  This is so big.
[00:33:53.396 --> 00:33:54.237]  But before I do that,
[00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:56.867]  You know, I had this really sweet Boston Terrier.
[00:33:56.887 --> 00:34:00.849]  He was kind of the old style of the breed, like 40 pounds, really smart, really cool, loved him.
[00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:05.171]  And he just got huge melanoma and grew so fast.
[00:34:05.252 --> 00:34:07.773]  I mean, like in a week, it got giant where he couldn't even breathe.
[00:34:08.653 --> 00:34:10.114]  And they wanted to give him chemotherapy.
[00:34:10.134 --> 00:34:12.215]  It would have been thousands and thousands of dollars.
[00:34:12.275 --> 00:34:13.176]  And I said, OK.
[00:34:14.016 --> 00:34:22.561]  But I said, in my experience, and I worked for a small animal vet and a large animal vet in high school, and I said, large animal vet on the summers, I said, it'll probably kill him.
[00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:50.565]  They gave him one shot of it and then he basically had an allergic reaction and by the time I got to the vet yesterday afternoon he was basically unable to breathe and turning purple when I got in there so I just he was basically about to pass out he was strangling and they tried a bunch of things steroids adrenaline stuff like that so they did so he you know they gave him a lethal injection
[00:34:51.681 --> 00:34:52.682]  And so I was depressed.
[00:34:52.702 --> 00:35:01.370]  I mean, it's not like when a member of the family dies, a human, but it also, as I said a few days ago when we found out he had cancer, it makes you think about all the others you've lost, all those that have died.
[00:35:02.512 --> 00:35:05.114]  And really, I just want to say this, I don't take life for granted.
[00:35:05.334 --> 00:35:11.480]  I realize how precious and transitory and fragile it is, and I realize how wondrous the blessings are of our everyday life.
[00:35:12.902 --> 00:35:14.143]  I mean, when I sit down and eat a meal,
[00:35:16.139 --> 00:35:17.180]  I appreciate it.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.241]  I am thankful for it.
[00:35:18.261 --> 00:35:19.402]  I'm not saying I'm good, either.
[00:35:19.622 --> 00:35:21.584]  This is why I feel good in my life, though.
[00:35:21.844 --> 00:35:23.906]  Because I'm just operating the way you're supposed to.
[00:35:24.307 --> 00:35:25.948]  My head is screwed on partially straight.
[00:35:26.849 --> 00:35:28.691]  Compared to most people, it's screwed on backwards.
[00:35:29.956 --> 00:35:36.498]  And I see all these unhappy yuppies and liberals and conservatives, minorities, whatever.
[00:35:36.518 --> 00:35:37.618]  I don't want to just pick on yuppies.
[00:35:37.958 --> 00:35:38.938]  People are spoiled.
[00:35:38.978 --> 00:35:44.759]  Madison Avenue makes you think you don't have enough, makes you think that your life isn't good, makes you think you don't look right.
[00:35:45.059 --> 00:35:50.781]  I see these beautiful women all the time, and I read the studies where the more beautiful a woman is, the more ugly she thinks she is.
[00:35:52.535 --> 00:35:54.538]  We are living in the middle of wonderment.
[00:35:54.598 --> 00:35:55.839]  You're only alive one time.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.822]  So, uh, the dog died.
[00:35:57.842 --> 00:36:00.926]  We got, uh, grandma to come over and take care of the kids.
[00:36:00.946 --> 00:36:03.008]  I went over to my parents because they got a couple acres in town.
[00:36:03.909 --> 00:36:09.797]  We dug a hole, buried the dog, and, uh,
[00:36:12.975 --> 00:36:15.876]  Sun was setting, and my wife was hungry, so we went over to play.
[00:36:15.896 --> 00:36:17.336]  We pull up, and we get out.
[00:36:17.376 --> 00:36:20.217]  The sun's just set, and giant moonrise.
[00:36:20.657 --> 00:36:22.197]  Huge red moon rising.
[00:36:22.277 --> 00:36:23.117]  Totally gorgeous.
[00:36:23.418 --> 00:36:28.019]  You can see planets popping out, right as we looked under the sky, right as nightfall came.
[00:36:28.399 --> 00:36:32.380]  You can see the planets appearing, and a cool breeze.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.840]  The first hints of fall.
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.921]  Probably about 75 degrees.
[00:36:36.281 --> 00:36:38.041]  The smell of juniper.
[00:36:40.102 --> 00:36:41.682]  The smell of cut grass.
[00:36:42.779 --> 00:36:46.562]  And I just saw incredible beauty standing right there in a Scripp Mall parking lot.
[00:36:48.063 --> 00:36:49.704]  And then how beautiful my wife was.
[00:36:50.745 --> 00:36:51.966]  And how blessed I am.
[00:36:53.267 --> 00:36:59.752]  And, again, we just don't recognize people can walk by wonderment.
[00:36:59.852 --> 00:37:06.618]  I mean, we're on a planet hurtling through space out in the boondocks of a spiral galaxy.
[00:37:07.378 --> 00:37:08.139]  There's life.
[00:37:08.279 --> 00:37:10.841]  I mean, insects on the ground are so complex.
[00:37:11.875 --> 00:37:32.205]  In their design, squirrels, pigeons, falcons, eagles, deer, the beautiful lakes and rivers and tadpoles, and the human beings with the electrical life force, energy, their soul burning.
[00:37:32.705 --> 00:37:40.147]  I still see some people that are still burning with life force and humanity and just literally the energy that God has put into us.
[00:37:40.167 --> 00:37:41.628]  We're made in God's image.
[00:37:41.888 --> 00:37:46.469]  What we envision, we then are able decades or generations later to build.
[00:37:46.509 --> 00:37:49.010]  I mean, that is God-like power.
[00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.231]  The shadow of it, but still the shadow is mighty.
[00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:56.952]  And I'm going to tell you women, you're a few pounds overweight.
[00:37:57.072 --> 00:37:57.553]  So what?
[00:37:57.593 --> 00:37:58.613]  Stop feeling inadequate.
[00:37:58.833 --> 00:38:01.834]  It's the fact that you're insecure that doesn't make you look desirable.
[00:38:04.036 --> 00:38:09.019]  A woman can be 30 pounds overweight, but if she's got fire in her eyes, she's beautiful.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.243]  They suck your soul out for a bunch of baubles and garbage!
[00:38:15.704 --> 00:38:19.006]  They make you think if you don't have fame and aren't well known that you have nothing.
[00:38:19.306 --> 00:38:20.727]  None of that means anything, folks.
[00:38:21.477 --> 00:38:23.259]  In fact, it's actually a detriment at the end of the day.
[00:38:23.519 --> 00:38:24.580]  Unless you're doing it for good.
[00:38:25.241 --> 00:38:27.043]  Having a fancy car means nothing.
[00:38:27.063 --> 00:38:28.884]  I have no desire to have some fancy car.
[00:38:29.084 --> 00:38:32.788]  I want a car that runs well, that's got good acceleration, that isn't going to break down on my family.
[00:38:32.948 --> 00:38:34.530]  But after that, I don't care!
[00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:37.771]  And I don't want fancy clothes.
[00:38:37.831 --> 00:38:39.352]  I mean, I'm not a Buddhist monk or anything.
[00:38:39.372 --> 00:38:44.195]  I'm not a Buddhist, but I almost want to sometimes shave my head and walk around in a loincloth.
[00:38:44.235 --> 00:38:48.738]  I mean, I don't want to wear jewelry and crud hanging off of me.
[00:38:48.818 --> 00:38:50.439]  I don't want to be arrogant.
[00:38:50.519 --> 00:38:51.740]  I don't want to be vain.
[00:38:53.261 --> 00:38:57.023]  People mistake my anger and my focus and my energy as arrogance.
[00:38:57.243 --> 00:38:57.984]  It's not arrogance.
[00:38:58.024 --> 00:39:03.347]  It's life force crying out against the spirit of the New World Order, of the Antichrists.
[00:39:04.492 --> 00:39:05.373]  I love life.
[00:39:05.513 --> 00:39:06.533]  I love wholesomeness.
[00:39:06.633 --> 00:39:17.680]  I've told you many times I love driving a car and seeing the cut fields, the rows of crops, and of seeing people on tractors and happy children running in yards.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.142]  I love seeing a dog with puppies.
[00:39:21.322 --> 00:39:22.703]  I love life force.
[00:39:24.343 --> 00:39:24.824]  I love it.
[00:39:24.924 --> 00:39:28.486]  I'm not afraid to die because I realize I am part of that life force.
[00:39:30.268 --> 00:39:32.151]  I realize we're all part of a chain.
[00:39:32.431 --> 00:39:32.992]  You're black.
[00:39:33.032 --> 00:39:33.573]  You're white.
[00:39:33.974 --> 00:39:35.776]  We all come from the same cloth.
[00:39:35.796 --> 00:39:36.958]  We are all together.
[00:39:37.138 --> 00:39:38.280]  We breathe the same air.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.502]  We drink the same water.
[00:39:41.004 --> 00:39:43.548]  People say, well then why are you bashing all the illegal aliens coming in?
[00:39:43.588 --> 00:39:45.070]  Because they've been mobilized
[00:39:46.747 --> 00:39:51.369]  Tribally, by the New World Order, in the chess game, I'm fighting the chess game they're playing.
[00:39:51.709 --> 00:39:53.170]  I don't dislike those people.
[00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.031]  I know why they wave their Mexican flags.
[00:39:55.051 --> 00:39:55.651]  They're tribal.
[00:39:55.851 --> 00:39:57.192]  They haven't had it drummed out of them yet.
[00:39:57.652 --> 00:39:58.473]  They're more healthy.
[00:39:58.733 --> 00:39:59.953]  They're not aborting their babies.
[00:40:00.093 --> 00:40:01.094]  They're having children.
[00:40:01.234 --> 00:40:01.854]  They're living!
[00:40:02.855 --> 00:40:06.356]  The point is, they've been used as a weapon by the New World Order!
[00:40:06.496 --> 00:40:09.478]  And whatever the New World Order's designs are, we've got to fight them!
[00:40:12.674 --> 00:40:14.655]  People say, well then reach out to the illegal aliens.
[00:40:15.075 --> 00:40:16.075]  I don't have a lot of money.
[00:40:16.155 --> 00:40:17.256]  I don't have a lot of staff.
[00:40:18.596 --> 00:40:19.617]  I don't have the time.
[00:40:19.677 --> 00:40:22.498]  I don't put everything into Spanish and do it and translate it.
[00:40:22.758 --> 00:40:23.378]  You do it!
[00:40:23.438 --> 00:40:24.019]  Please!
[00:40:24.259 --> 00:40:25.079]  Be my guest!
[00:40:29.741 --> 00:40:30.941]  Alright, I said I'd get to the news.
[00:40:32.322 --> 00:40:36.984]  I just see what Gary Hart and all these snakes are doing and everything else and I just want to warn people.
[00:40:38.284 --> 00:40:42.286]  And I just want you to feel good about yourself and I want you to realize you are in the middle
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.620]  So much good.
[00:40:46.321 --> 00:40:47.141]  This is not hell.
[00:40:47.181 --> 00:40:50.462]  People sarcastically say, you know, I don't think there's a hell.
[00:40:50.503 --> 00:40:51.043]  This is hell.
[00:40:52.163 --> 00:40:53.204]  This isn't hell.
[00:40:53.984 --> 00:40:59.586]  Beautiful oceans crashing into moss-covered rocks and lighthouses, to use the cliché.
[00:41:02.508 --> 00:41:05.429]  The milk and honey running through the streets.
[00:41:07.049 --> 00:41:10.571]  And then everything out of the New World Order, everything it pumps out is vile and poisonous.
[00:41:11.744 --> 00:41:14.906]  So I see these seeping sores everywhere on the beauty.
[00:41:15.747 --> 00:41:22.011]  And let me tell you, those sores are still the minority, but they are spreading and they are taking over and I don't like seeing it happen!
[00:41:27.615 --> 00:41:32.459]  And as my discernment increases over the years, sharpens, I just see things more and more clearly now.
[00:41:34.247 --> 00:41:42.310]  And my mind, again, is just alive electrically with wonderment and thankfulness and on my knees.
[00:41:42.731 --> 00:41:45.692]  I'm on my knees every second in my soul before God.
[00:41:46.092 --> 00:41:48.833]  I am on my knees every second in thanks.
[00:41:51.154 --> 00:42:00.758]  And except for the few times a day that I feel my psyche shift into an evil dark light and it's just so horrible, once you know good, to feel yourself shift into wickedness.
[00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:10.585]  And those that love darkness think that if they just run darker, if they just run deeper down the rat hole, that they're going to find something.
[00:42:10.625 --> 00:42:12.846]  And you're not ever going to find anything but more pain.
[00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:20.931]  We are in a time that tries men and women's souls.
[00:42:21.751 --> 00:42:22.312]  That is true.
[00:42:22.352 --> 00:42:26.414]  We're in a time of great opportunity and great testing and great challenge.
[00:42:26.734 --> 00:42:31.137]  You are alive literally at the end of a great age and the beginning of
[00:42:32.199 --> 00:42:34.240]  An even greater age to come.
[00:42:36.601 --> 00:42:43.604]  And it is going to be a test of those that love good and those that love light versus those that love darkness.
[00:42:50.748 --> 00:42:54.689]  I may look foul and even act foul sometimes, but you know I feel fair.
[00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:58.051]  And that's because from the bottom of my heart
[00:42:58.945 --> 00:43:13.431]  From the very bedrock of my soul, I want you to know that I love all of you out there that seek after goodness, and who still have a conscience, and who love the innocent, and who love life!
[00:43:19.414 --> 00:43:26.137]  For those that have embraced darkness, that have been fully given over to it, they only see my statements as weakness, and they snicker, and they cackle.
[00:43:28.211 --> 00:43:33.535]  But they know deep in their heart, deep in their soul, that they have already failed.
[00:43:33.796 --> 00:43:40.741]  Since the foundations of the earth were laid down, you were destined to fail miserably.
[00:43:41.662 --> 00:43:52.451]  God has things in store that the ear has not heard, the eye has not seen, that we cannot even imagine and fathom as we spread across the stars.
[00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:57.060]  And the New World Order hates it.
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:01.341]  They hate the fact that we're destined to people the stars.
[00:44:01.621 --> 00:44:04.082]  That we're destined to travel to distant galaxies.
[00:44:04.262 --> 00:44:08.884]  That we are destined to grow into something so incredible and beautiful.
[00:44:09.104 --> 00:44:13.865]  Right now we are literally in a larval stage, ladies and gentlemen, for what God has planned for us.
[00:44:14.586 --> 00:44:24.729]  And they try to have the establishment churches give you a lie, give you something watered down, give you poison, give you a fraud, until you turn away from the great destiny of humanity.
[00:44:25.703 --> 00:44:39.168]  Oh, watch that winning film festival submission where humans are this disease and this plight, and oh, it's horrible curtains when it shows spaceships taking off from the planet and going out into the universe like we're some disease.
[00:44:39.828 --> 00:44:43.790]  No, it's people that have that view about humanity who are the disease!
[00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:51.512]  And every time you find out who the true authors of environmental degradation are, they are the authors!
[00:44:51.872 --> 00:44:53.073]  They are the handmaidens!
[00:44:54.187 --> 00:45:01.813]  They are the masons who built their black temples to their dark gods.
[00:45:03.474 --> 00:45:06.396]  They are selfish and they are weak!
[00:45:07.537 --> 00:45:08.478]  Alright, I'm done preaching.
[00:45:11.946 --> 00:45:14.768]  Unsolicited Advice to the Government of Iran.
[00:45:14.808 --> 00:45:16.829]  This is a letter by Gary Hart.
[00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:26.196]  Now, again, this is crafted, this is twisted, but this is a, to someone in state's craft, they will know exactly what this means instantaneously.
[00:45:27.897 --> 00:45:35.322]  I read this, Tim read this, and I read what I thought it meant, and he said that's exactly the point I wanted to see if you thought the same thing I thought, exactly.
[00:45:35.703 --> 00:45:37.664]  Presuming, this is him writing to Iran,
[00:45:39.386 --> 00:45:43.150]  Gary Hart, Senator Hart, Homeland Security Creator.
[00:45:43.811 --> 00:45:55.204]  Presuming that you are not actually ignorant enough to desire war with the United States, you might be well advised to read the history of the sinking of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor, an 1898 staged event.
[00:45:57.483 --> 00:46:00.184]  And the history of the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964.
[00:46:01.324 --> 00:46:02.784]  Now they're completely declassified.
[00:46:02.824 --> 00:46:03.845]  That was totally staged.
[00:46:04.145 --> 00:46:05.045]  No one attacked the ships.
[00:46:05.305 --> 00:46:09.826]  The ships went in with gunboats and attacked the shore and the Vietnamese were smart enough not to fire back.
[00:46:10.206 --> 00:46:16.468]  Now you'll argue about 1898 because of History Channel disinfo specials, but what is known is they didn't blow the ship up and the government knew that.
[00:46:17.648 --> 00:46:24.230]  Their backup story is they knew it was a boiler and lied, but everybody gone off the ship for a strange leave they never did and it blew up?
[00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:24.850]  Come on.
[00:46:26.071 --> 00:46:26.791]  So that's stage two.
[00:46:28.937 --> 00:46:33.698]  And Bush says he craps himself after William McKinley, the president at the time.
[00:46:34.738 --> 00:46:39.380]  Alright, so he says, hey, you don't think we'll attack you?
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.981]  You know about the USS Maine and you know about the Gulf of Tonkin, pal?
[00:46:44.361 --> 00:46:52.923]  Remember, it's Gary Hart who said we need to use this disaster, 9-11 attacks, to create a new world order.
[00:46:54.477 --> 00:47:01.120]  He goes on, having done so, you will surely recognize that Americans are reluctant to go to war unless attacked.
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:02.740]  That's double meaning.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.521]  He's saying, well, we haven't been attacked, but we could be.
[00:47:06.322 --> 00:47:10.543]  You think they're against the war right now, but somebody could stage a Tonkin or a Havana.
[00:47:10.943 --> 00:47:13.124]  By the way, Gary Hart's a well-known historian.
[00:47:13.164 --> 00:47:14.285]  He's written a bunch of history books.
[00:47:15.205 --> 00:47:16.265]  And he is quite a historian.
[00:47:16.285 --> 00:47:17.946]  I've seen him in two-hour talks on C-SPAN.
[00:47:18.607 --> 00:47:20.288]  He knows more than I do in many areas.
[00:47:20.348 --> 00:47:21.629]  And I'm a generalist.
[00:47:21.669 --> 00:47:22.389]  I have general knowledge.
[00:47:22.809 --> 00:47:25.671]  The point is that he has written books on our military history.
[00:47:26.111 --> 00:47:27.151]  He's an expert on McKinley.
[00:47:27.792 --> 00:47:29.313]  He knows this is all staged.
[00:47:29.653 --> 00:47:31.914]  And he's saying, hey, we stage stuff, buddy!
[00:47:32.854 --> 00:47:39.738]  Now, Zbigniew Brzezinski, founder of the Trilateral Commission, David Rockefeller's main minion, his legate,
[00:47:40.362 --> 00:47:42.705]  He said, what, on, what was it, February 7th?
[00:47:42.985 --> 00:47:43.606]  Was it 9th?
[00:47:43.646 --> 00:47:44.047]  I forget.
[00:47:44.607 --> 00:47:48.873]  This year he said, hey, they may stage terror attacks and provocations to attack Iran.
[00:47:48.913 --> 00:47:49.093]  See?
[00:47:49.814 --> 00:47:49.994]  See?
[00:47:50.355 --> 00:47:51.356]  That's right out in the open.
[00:47:53.559 --> 00:47:54.260]  So did you hear that?
[00:47:55.965 --> 00:47:59.687]  Having done so, you will surely recognize that Americans are reluctant to go to war unless attacked.
[00:48:00.048 --> 00:48:04.050]  Until Pearl Harbor, we were even reluctant to get involved in World War II.
[00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:08.233]  For historians of American wars, the question is whether we provoke provocations.
[00:48:08.693 --> 00:48:16.658]  He comes right out and says, for historians of American wars, the question is whether we provoke provocations.
[00:48:16.979 --> 00:48:20.461]  Gary Hart says, you better do what we say!
[00:48:20.761 --> 00:48:21.762]  We'll stage it!
[00:48:21.922 --> 00:48:23.423]  He says it clearly!
[00:48:24.063 --> 00:48:37.951]  With one little membrane of maneuvering where he can say, that's not what I said, because he knows that the average moron who hasn't truly even become a conscious creature won't be able to read that and see what it says.
[00:48:40.673 --> 00:48:42.554]  Let me read it to you again, slowly.
[00:48:43.573 --> 00:48:57.212]  This is a letter by Gary Hart, the architect of the Homeland Security Apparatchik, the guy who bragged about how we're about to get hit and we're going to take all your rights when it happens and we need to use 9-11 after it happened a couple days after for a New World Order.
[00:49:01.255 --> 00:49:14.779]  Presuming that you are not actually ignorant enough to desire war with the United States, you might be well advised to read the history of the shrinking of the USS Maine and Havana Harbor in 1898, and the history of the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:23.062]  Having done so, you would surely recognize that Americans are reluctant to go to war unless attacked.
[00:49:23.842 --> 00:49:27.743]  Until Pearl Harbor, we were even reluctant to get involved in World War II.
[00:49:28.607 --> 00:49:33.508]  For historians of American wars, the question is whether we provoke provocations.
[00:49:34.568 --> 00:49:38.029]  Do I have neocon, little weak neocon followers listening?
[00:49:38.609 --> 00:49:39.989]  Right now, this is Gary Hart.
[00:49:40.209 --> 00:49:42.270]  Okay, this is the guy that wrote the Homeland Security Plan.
[00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:45.490]  This is the guy who's definitely at the highest levels of this.
[00:49:47.331 --> 00:49:52.332]  The Hart-Rubin Commission saying, the question is do we stage things?
[00:49:52.652 --> 00:49:54.572]  And he just gave two examples of where it was staged.
[00:49:57.793 --> 00:49:58.373]  A historian.
[00:49:59.654 --> 00:50:02.777]  A top globalist strategist who carries out policy.
[00:50:03.778 --> 00:50:09.203]  They came out with the Homeland Security 51 recommendations before 9-11.
[00:50:10.043 --> 00:50:16.229]  And after 9-11, 48 of the 51, the other, Hart says 48 were implemented.
[00:50:16.289 --> 00:50:17.570]  I look, 51 were implemented.
[00:50:19.111 --> 00:50:20.913]  He says, well we didn't get a national ID card.
[00:50:20.973 --> 00:50:21.794]  He's playing games there.
[00:50:21.834 --> 00:50:22.454]  We have one.
[00:50:23.315 --> 00:50:25.537]  That was one of the ones they claim they didn't get.
[00:50:25.817 --> 00:50:26.538]  And they did get it.
[00:50:27.365 --> 00:50:30.519]  It's a little snickering joke at the public that isn't informed.
[00:50:31.286 --> 00:50:33.187]  And he goes on, and it gets even worse, folks.
[00:50:34.447 --> 00:50:37.208]  We'll come back into that, and I promise I'm going to spend a lot of time on Saddam.
[00:50:37.928 --> 00:50:39.009]  That is the huge story.
[00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:44.150]  He tried to give up, and they said, no, we've got to run a genocide off against you, and we'll go over all the evidence of that.
[00:50:44.651 --> 00:50:47.652]  Ultramassive reports, ultramassive information.
[00:50:47.972 --> 00:50:50.112]  Call everybody you know, tell them to tune in.
[00:50:50.412 --> 00:50:52.653]  I want them to hear this Saddam information coming up.
[00:50:53.013 --> 00:50:57.715]  I mean, this proves the whole war, without a shadow of a doubt, was premeditated, bloodthirsty genocide.
[00:51:04.651 --> 00:51:10.118]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.479 --> 00:51:18.128]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.812 --> 00:51:25.875]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.255 --> 00:51:37.680]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.541]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.961 --> 00:51:44.182]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.222 --> 00:51:48.064]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:03.337 --> 00:52:07.840]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:12.262]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:52:12.562 --> 00:52:13.123]  We listened.
[00:52:13.423 --> 00:52:18.405]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:52:18.686 --> 00:52:19.146]  We listened.
[00:52:19.546 --> 00:52:22.567]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:52:23.007 --> 00:52:23.548]  We listened.
[00:52:24.008 --> 00:52:28.069]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:52:28.449 --> 00:52:28.930]  We listened.
[00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:34.512]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:52:34.932 --> 00:52:35.212]  Again,
[00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:36.272]  We listened.
[00:52:36.652 --> 00:52:38.233]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:52:38.413 --> 00:52:44.036]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:52:44.436 --> 00:52:47.077]  Get the Berkey Light at the American Water Purifier.
[00:52:47.277 --> 00:52:47.457]  Only $279.
[00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:47.997]  Call New Millennium.
[00:52:48.017 --> 00:52:48.057]  888-803-4438.
[00:52:48.157 --> 00:52:48.397]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:52:48.457 --> 00:52:50.098]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:50.138 --> 00:52:51.078]  Now yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:01.033 --> 00:53:03.074]  The superfood for you and your family.
[00:53:03.474 --> 00:53:06.755]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[00:53:07.216 --> 00:53:07.496]  Hemp.
[00:53:07.896 --> 00:53:10.657]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[00:53:10.997 --> 00:53:11.297]  Hemp.
[00:53:11.637 --> 00:53:18.080]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:21.702]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[00:53:21.982 --> 00:53:25.824]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[00:53:26.164 --> 00:53:30.486]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments.
[00:53:30.846 --> 00:53:37.249]  Loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[00:53:37.569 --> 00:53:41.893]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[00:53:42.093 --> 00:53:43.955]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?
[00:53:44.215 --> 00:53:50.440]  Call today at 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:54.123]  Learn, help, shop at hempusa.org.
[00:53:54.303 --> 00:53:55.364]  We do not charge for shipping.
[00:53:55.424 --> 00:53:56.625]  That's 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[00:54:06.809 --> 00:54:12.772]  This is the end, beautiful friend.
[00:54:16.234 --> 00:54:21.596]  This is the end, my only friend.
[00:54:21.956 --> 00:54:27.779]  The end of all in love with love.
[00:54:27.999 --> 00:54:33.862]  The end of everything that's done.
[00:54:34.002 --> 00:54:34.583]  The end
[00:54:43.026 --> 00:54:57.619]  The chance for the President of the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his father, a phrase his father used I think only once, and hasn't been used since, and that is a new world order.
[00:54:57.639 --> 00:54:59.360]  A new world coming.
[00:55:01.682 --> 00:55:07.587]  America will become increasingly vulnerable to hostile attack on our homeland
[00:55:08.684 --> 00:55:13.227]  And our military superiority will not entirely protect us.
[00:55:14.649 --> 00:55:20.753]  Americans will likely die on American soil, possibly in large numbers.
[00:55:20.773 --> 00:55:21.334]  Alright.
[00:55:24.216 --> 00:55:25.957]  Let's go ahead and play Gary Hart.
[00:55:26.377 --> 00:55:37.986]  This is two days after 9-11, on C-SPAN, saying that on a Council on Foreign Relations meeting that Limbaugh says doesn't exist,
[00:55:38.644 --> 00:55:41.545]  And by the way, Limbaugh used to say it didn't exist ten years ago.
[00:55:41.705 --> 00:55:43.345]  Now he'll say it exists but doesn't run anything.
[00:55:44.126 --> 00:55:46.006]  So now he tries to say, I never said it didn't exist.
[00:55:46.066 --> 00:55:48.007]  Yeah, buddy, I heard it out of your mouth hundreds of times.
[00:55:48.727 --> 00:55:49.647]  Literally hundreds of times.
[00:55:50.087 --> 00:55:56.869]  Here is the CFR, here's Gary Hart, gloating, right after 9-11, saying, use it to set up a new world order.
[00:55:56.909 --> 00:55:57.289]  Here it is.
[00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:02.291]  There is a chance for the President of the United States to use this disaster
[00:56:03.251 --> 00:56:10.615]  To carry out what his father, a phrase his father used I think only once, and hasn't been used since, and that is a New World Order.
[00:56:11.195 --> 00:56:12.316]  New World Coming.
[00:56:12.536 --> 00:56:12.836]  Alright.
[00:56:14.317 --> 00:56:16.118]  And that's the second clip from the same piece.
[00:56:17.098 --> 00:56:18.219]  That's in Road to Tyranny.
[00:56:18.419 --> 00:56:19.760]  It's also in Masters of Terror.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:24.342]  You can watch them on Google Video for free, or watch them in higher quality at Prison Planet.
[00:56:25.169 --> 00:56:31.813]  We've got a bunch of the new TV reports and a bunch of the films, several of the films in the news, super high quality.
[00:56:32.234 --> 00:56:36.496]  We're going to be going back and uploading all the old films in the next few months into the news, super high quality.
[00:56:36.816 --> 00:56:42.460]  The old versions are still better than Google, but even more reason to get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.021]  You'll be able to see in-game all of it.
[00:56:44.521 --> 00:56:44.802]  I think so.
[00:57:07.199 --> 00:57:11.280]  Later in the next hour, we're going to open the phones up so you can give us your take on Gary Hart.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.541]  But, I mean, what take is there?
[00:57:13.581 --> 00:57:29.584]  This is now up on PrisonPlanet.com, where he says to Iran, Gary Hart, presuming that you are not actually ignorant enough to desire war with the United States, you might be well advised to read the history of the sinking of the USS Maine in Nevada Harbor in 1898, the history of the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964.
[00:57:30.925 --> 00:57:35.526]  He's going to say, for historians of American wars, the question is whether we provoke provocations.
[00:57:35.906 --> 00:57:36.726]  He's saying, hey,
[00:57:38.912 --> 00:57:39.892]  We'll blow stuff up.
[00:57:39.952 --> 00:57:45.635]  In fact, Hart came out a few years ago and said, nukes will go off in Dallas, Denver, Cleveland, and Chicago.
[00:57:45.655 --> 00:57:48.516]  Who do you think is going to detonate those?
[00:57:48.616 --> 00:57:50.297]  And it'll all be over then.
[00:57:50.777 --> 00:57:50.957]  See?
[00:57:52.417 --> 00:57:57.960]  All the yuppiedom, all the bobbles, all the trinketry that you worship won't matter much anymore.
[00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:00.221]  And I know you'll run and worship those that did it.
[00:58:00.281 --> 00:58:01.681]  I understand some of you out there.
[00:58:02.081 --> 00:58:03.022]  But a lot of us won't.
[00:58:03.042 --> 00:58:03.802]  A lot of us will know.
[00:58:05.726 --> 00:58:09.669]  You see, that's why I've got courage, because I'm willing to die.
[00:58:09.689 --> 00:58:12.091]  And I don't mean I'm going to run out and start some fight.
[00:58:12.111 --> 00:58:20.997]  I mean, did I have to be grabbed and tortured or killed to fight a bunch of murderers and stage attacks and try to launch World War III?
[00:58:21.037 --> 00:58:24.119]  I mean, but none of that has to happen.
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:30.284]  If you'll just stand up, if you'll just get involved, if you'll just take action,
[00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:34.532]  It's up to you if they're gonna win or not.
[00:58:35.072 --> 00:58:36.313]  It's not a foregone conclusion.
[00:58:36.634 --> 00:58:38.095]  You control the destiny!
[00:58:41.338 --> 00:58:46.183]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.203 --> 00:58:46.323]  Hello!
[00:58:57.179 --> 00:59:01.382]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.022 --> 00:59:02.843]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.583 --> 00:59:04.564]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.144 --> 00:59:08.867]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.347 --> 00:59:13.410]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.082 --> 00:59:24.945]  Oh, yeah.
[00:59:33.476 --> 00:59:38.057]  We are now into the second hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:38.437 --> 00:59:41.758]  For stations that just joined us, this is huge, important news.
[00:59:42.098 --> 00:59:46.859]  A key globalist, a legged level New World Order minion for the globalists.
[00:59:47.339 --> 00:59:49.800]  One who speaks officially for the New World Order.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:50.960]  He's one of the few.
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:55.021]  Gary Hart, Warren Rudman, Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:59:55.561 --> 00:59:56.762]  People of that level.
[00:59:57.022 --> 00:59:57.802]  There's not many of them.
[00:59:57.822 --> 00:59:58.682]  There's less than ten.
[00:59:58.742 --> 01:00:02.103]  James Baker, George Bush Sr., George Shultz,
[01:00:03.384 --> 01:00:08.226]  They speak with direct power of the New World Order.
[01:00:10.187 --> 01:00:11.848]  He is telling Iran that the U.S.
[01:00:11.888 --> 01:00:14.229]  government will stage terror attacks unless they submit.
[01:00:14.429 --> 01:00:21.913]  He said it in plain English, plain words, and it's going up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[01:00:22.907 --> 01:00:24.668]  In fact, I sent it to Paul 20 minutes ago.
[01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:29.512]  I don't have the computer on right now in front of me because it's a distraction, but I'll find it during the break if it's up there.
[01:00:29.532 --> 01:00:30.353]  It needs to be up there.
[01:00:30.373 --> 01:00:36.438]  It's out there on the news wires and stuff, but they post it in plain view, not even telling people what it fully means.
[01:00:37.118 --> 01:00:41.642]  The other big top story that I haven't even gotten to yet, I need to do the background on, is huge.
[01:00:43.844 --> 01:00:48.828]  Saddam offered exile, but neocons unleashed carnage anyway.
[01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:51.450]  That's a good headline.
[01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:52.510]  Great story Paul wrote.
[01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:54.912]  This is being reported by major British and European papers.
[01:00:55.212 --> 01:00:59.055]  But I would have just said, uh, whole war was a fraud.
[01:00:59.115 --> 01:01:00.155]  Whole war was for a lie.
[01:01:00.416 --> 01:01:02.237]  Whole war could have been avoided.
[01:01:02.257 --> 01:01:04.999]  Uh, Saddam offered to give up.
[01:01:05.059 --> 01:01:06.680]  Neocons kept it secret.
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:08.161]  That's the news.
[01:01:08.761 --> 01:01:09.962]  That they kept it secret.
[01:01:12.243 --> 01:01:13.444]  Now let's back up here.
[01:01:14.425 --> 01:01:15.666]  Let's back up for a moment.
[01:01:17.947 --> 01:01:20.209]  Saddam Hussein, we need to create a timeline page.
[01:01:21.152 --> 01:01:22.113]  We don't have the personnel, though.
[01:01:22.133 --> 01:01:22.773]  We're all over work.
[01:01:23.074 --> 01:01:23.774]  Maybe you should do it.
[01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:26.316]  Go do it on Mainline History.
[01:01:26.336 --> 01:01:35.244]  1958, 18-year-old, promising young army officer out of the Iraqi military, only been in two years, is hired by the CIA, taken to Egypt.
[01:01:36.096 --> 01:01:40.838]  And in other areas of Europe, after that, for two plus years of CIA assassination training.
[01:01:41.278 --> 01:01:51.842]  He's inserted to lead an anti-communist kill squad that successfully runs the operation, killing hundreds of mid-level members of the communist-funded Ba'ath Party.
[01:01:53.162 --> 01:01:57.284]  He then unsuccessfully machine guns the car of the President, wounding him in the legs.
[01:01:57.324 --> 01:01:58.464]  Saddam is wounded.
[01:01:58.484 --> 01:02:03.846]  Going from memory here, go double-check that little detail, because sometimes now I have like a... I go, is that exactly right?
[01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:04.987]  And now my memory fails.
[01:02:05.932 --> 01:02:22.606]  But I know they, I know they wanted the President, I think Saddam was wanted, but side trivia issue, the Ba'athists come to their knees and say, okay, we'll go under U.S.-British control, we'll now be right-wing, we won't be communist, we'll do whatever you say, and they said, alright, put young Saddam Hussein as the head of Ba'athist security.
[01:02:24.167 --> 01:02:32.474]  And he's not that young, he didn't for, what, 19 years been committing assassinations and running hit squads.
[01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:39.354]  So, at 20 when he went into operation, he was hired when he was 18, at 19 to 18, so he was almost 40 then.
[01:02:39.374 --> 01:02:39.434]  And 39.
[01:02:40.995 --> 01:02:44.717]  When he's 39, he's made the head of Bathurst Security.
[01:02:54.554 --> 01:02:59.115]  And then, ten years later, in 1979, he stages a CIA coup.
[01:02:59.135 --> 01:03:01.295]  That's mainline history, mainline newspapers at the time.
[01:03:01.655 --> 01:03:05.196]  The young hero in the newspapers, he's a secularist.
[01:03:05.256 --> 01:03:06.376]  The Jews can live in peace.
[01:03:06.476 --> 01:03:07.956]  The Christians can live in peace.
[01:03:07.996 --> 01:03:09.877]  They're putting rock and roll stations on.
[01:03:09.897 --> 01:03:10.917]  They're selling Playboy.
[01:03:10.937 --> 01:03:13.817]  That was in our news.
[01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:14.758]  He's a good guy.
[01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:16.258]  Playboy's being sold.
[01:03:16.298 --> 01:03:17.258]  Everything's fine now.
[01:03:18.198 --> 01:03:19.278]  The shining jewel.
[01:03:19.458 --> 01:03:21.479]  And then suddenly it becomes a first world nation.
[01:03:21.819 --> 01:03:23.179]  Hospitals, colleges.
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:25.661]  And Israel and the U.S.
[01:03:25.681 --> 01:03:28.662]  said, uh-uh, set him up, bring him down, and they did.
[01:03:29.182 --> 01:03:30.603]  When we get back, we're going to walk through it.
[01:03:31.643 --> 01:03:35.685]  The extermination is now into year 17 of the black op.
[01:03:36.185 --> 01:03:37.226]  They're running in Iraq.
[01:03:38.667 --> 01:03:41.688]  And now it's admitted, well, we've already gotten the intel on.
[01:03:42.108 --> 01:03:48.051]  Saddam did try to take the deal to leave, and they just said, buddy, ha, you think we're serious?
[01:03:53.837 --> 01:04:02.924]  Now, you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:04:03.164 --> 01:04:14.393]  Black Flurky elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw, stagnant pond water, into delicious, crystal-clear drinking water.
[01:04:14.734 --> 01:04:20.418]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:04:20.478 --> 01:04:20.818]  I don't know.
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:40.421]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:04:40.461 --> 01:04:41.321]  Call New Millennium, 888-03-4438.
[01:04:41.361 --> 01:04:41.661]  That's 888-03-4438.
[01:04:41.721 --> 01:04:43.122]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:04:55.879 --> 01:04:59.060]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:01.341]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:05:01.701 --> 01:05:09.363]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.023 --> 01:05:17.086]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.486 --> 01:05:20.427]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:05:20.807 --> 01:05:23.168]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:05:23.548 --> 01:05:24.428]  NSA spies.
[01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:28.873]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.214 --> 01:05:32.797]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.177 --> 01:05:35.158]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.439 --> 01:05:39.382]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.076 --> 01:05:54.937]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:05:55.077 --> 01:06:01.761]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:10.205]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:16.208]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:06:16.228 --> 01:06:17.329]  My blood pressure has
[01:06:17.329 --> 01:06:17.609]  I think so.
[01:06:35.134 --> 01:06:35.474]  We're good.
[01:06:53.684 --> 01:06:55.845]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.445 --> 01:06:59.206]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:14.521 --> 01:07:16.702]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:07:16.962 --> 01:07:17.962]  until 2 p.m.
[01:07:18.522 --> 01:07:19.062]  Central Time.
[01:07:19.082 --> 01:07:23.623]  We're live on Artists Hit in three hours in talk radio period and you know it's true.
[01:07:25.023 --> 01:07:29.864]  We're dialed into the source, ladies and gentlemen, into history, into facts, into our guts.
[01:07:31.065 --> 01:07:37.666]  And we know the truth and we're fighting the New World Order at point-blank range Monday through Friday 11 to 2 Central, noon to 3 p.m.
[01:07:38.146 --> 01:07:41.187]  Eastern, that'd be 9 to noon Pacific, 10 to
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.541]  One mountain!
[01:07:46.422 --> 01:07:55.046]  And don't forget, every day when this show ends, if you miss the first hour or the second hour, it re-streams consecutively at InfoWars.com.
[01:07:55.106 --> 01:08:04.612]  Right when the show ends, the show re-airs back-to-back until the next live show, or you can subscribe to the free podcast at InfoWars.com, your MP3 or iPod device.
[01:08:05.616 --> 01:08:05.956]  Use it.
[01:08:05.997 --> 01:08:06.797]  Take advantage of it.
[01:08:06.857 --> 01:08:10.380]  I'm asking listeners to promote that pre-service of getting the information out.
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:12.101]  That is a great way for folks to listen.
[01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:13.762]  That's where the whole future of listening is going.
[01:08:13.782 --> 01:08:18.906]  If you're listening to an AM or FM station, that is the best way.
[01:08:19.287 --> 01:08:22.569]  Tell everybody about when the show airs live or when they rebroadcast it.
[01:08:22.969 --> 01:08:23.850]  Stop at red lights.
[01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:26.132]  Tell people that are standing there at a red light.
[01:08:27.053 --> 01:08:27.653]  Pedestrians.
[01:08:28.033 --> 01:08:29.114]  Hey, tune into 1330 out of Cameron.
[01:08:32.617 --> 01:08:48.121]  When Alex is on Monday through Friday, the first two hours, or tune in to KLBJ on the syndicated show in Norfolk, or upstate New York, or Kansas City, or Southern California, or in Austin, Texas, or I don't know, eight or nine other places we're on right now there.
[01:08:48.141 --> 01:08:48.821]  It's starting to grow.
[01:08:50.301 --> 01:08:53.882]  Or it's on WWCR, you know, if you're a ham radio operator, tell folks.
[01:08:54.002 --> 01:08:56.423]  I mean, we're fighting for the life of the Republic here.
[01:08:56.463 --> 01:08:57.303]  This is life and death.
[01:09:01.164 --> 01:09:01.304]  Now,
[01:09:03.695 --> 01:09:07.417]  Let me just recap, because I know some stations just joined us briefly, and then I'll get into the new history of it.
[01:09:07.437 --> 01:09:08.457]  Okay, new information.
[01:09:10.058 --> 01:09:10.978]  This is admitted.
[01:09:10.998 --> 01:09:25.344]  I mean, I remember my mother cooking dinner with a little color TV she had in the kitchen in Dallas, and I, because I have, again, I used to have a photographic memory, but once you hit 30, you start having massive brain cell die-off.
[01:09:25.804 --> 01:09:28.585]  That's why they say the best scientists make their best discoveries under 30.
[01:09:30.221 --> 01:09:38.384]  Because, I mean, the brain, you've made all these new neural pathways, you've learned all this stuff, you're in your prime, and then at 30, for some reason, the brain starts dying, starts shrinking.
[01:09:38.904 --> 01:09:40.785]  And I'm creating new neural pathways, I'm still smart.
[01:09:41.605 --> 01:09:48.728]  It's just, I can remember almost everything when I was a child, everything, you know, up until a couple years ago.
[01:09:48.748 --> 01:09:50.589]  And then now I still have a really good memory.
[01:09:50.629 --> 01:09:53.410]  It's still an elephant's memory, but it's corrupted.
[01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:56.051]  Like, I had read
[01:09:57.429 --> 01:10:05.635]  I remember years ago in 99 that 83,000 vets had been told they couldn't buy guns anymore, and that was in the news.
[01:10:06.476 --> 01:10:15.162]  Now, granted, that was many years ago, but I said 86,000, and Larry Pratt said, no, 83,000.
[01:10:16.403 --> 01:10:19.345]  But my memory is still good enough, though, that I go, wait, that's corrupted data.
[01:10:21.903 --> 01:10:29.868]  Like I can tell when I'm wrong, and then I go, wait a minute, and I always heard other talk show hosts doing that, and older talk show hosts, and I was like, ah, I'm not like that.
[01:10:29.888 --> 01:10:35.331]  I know I'm talking about this a lot on the air now, it's just weird to not have the exact thing.
[01:10:35.371 --> 01:10:36.632]  So you gotta check what I say.
[01:10:38.573 --> 01:10:39.613]  You gotta check what I say.
[01:10:40.274 --> 01:10:41.434]  Because I still got a great memory.
[01:10:42.095 --> 01:10:47.798]  But, and I've also seen some people that say the brain's saying, well over time too, you gather so much data,
[01:10:48.442 --> 01:10:51.105]  That then it starts conflicting, because now there's so much.
[01:10:51.206 --> 01:10:56.872]  I mean, it's just like... Oh my gosh, I mean, there's so much I know.
[01:10:57.113 --> 01:10:58.735]  And then I realize how little I know.
[01:10:58.775 --> 01:10:59.956]  There's so much more to know.
[01:11:00.677 --> 01:11:03.080]  But compared to some person on the street, I mean, it's like...
[01:11:06.593 --> 01:11:11.697]  It's like a cockroach compared to a meerkat, you know, in knowledge and intelligence.
[01:11:11.737 --> 01:11:15.301]  And I want them to stop being cockroaches, and to get more of an intellect.
[01:11:15.681 --> 01:11:17.683]  Not just walk around going, I like money!
[01:11:18.523 --> 01:11:20.585]  Oh, look, my favorite show's on!
[01:11:20.885 --> 01:11:23.247]  You know, like, idiocracy, just completely mindless.
[01:11:23.327 --> 01:11:24.388]  Alright, I'm digressing.
[01:11:24.408 --> 01:11:32.255]  You tune in to get the history of Saddam, the new big developments with Gary Hart saying, look out or we'll stage terror attacks on you.
[01:11:32.275 --> 01:11:33.236]  And that's clearly what he's saying.
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:37.201]  I mean, now they're really getting arrogant.
[01:11:37.221 --> 01:11:52.790]  We've had the neocons come out and write articles saying we need another 9-11, 9-11 was good for us, and Senators, former Senators, Republican Party heads, state heads, PAC heads, now they're openly saying it to Iran?
[01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:56.993]  I mean, this is the most gauntlet down the table I've ever seen.
[01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:01.389]  And I'm going to get to that next, but right now, let me get into Saddam.
[01:12:01.689 --> 01:12:04.451]  Now, I want to tell the neocons listening something here.
[01:12:04.872 --> 01:12:06.273]  We had Larry Pratt on, okay?
[01:12:06.493 --> 01:12:09.015]  The second biggest gun owners association in the country.
[01:12:09.395 --> 01:12:12.237]  You know how many members they have?
[01:12:12.257 --> 01:12:12.237]  300,000.
[01:12:14.819 --> 01:12:16.140]  But that was seven years ago.
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:17.621]  When Clinton left, it dropped to 140,000.
[01:12:19.412 --> 01:12:20.293]  That is a shame.
[01:12:20.573 --> 01:12:24.335]  And Larry Pratt has all the documents, and the letters, and the information.
[01:12:24.595 --> 01:12:30.538]  How the NRA was founded as just a shooting club, and then became the first gun control movement.
[01:12:31.038 --> 01:12:36.041]  Now I already knew that, but to hear it from Larry Pratt, and to hear the new documents they've gotten from the National Archives.
[01:12:37.442 --> 01:12:43.085]  To know that they, the NRA authored and pushed the 68 Gun Control Act.
[01:12:43.145 --> 01:12:43.845]  They did it!
[01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:52.153]  I remember like ten years ago, I guess about eight years ago, when I interviewed Charlton Heston right before he retired.
[01:12:52.173 --> 01:12:54.314]  And I like Charlton Heston.
[01:12:54.354 --> 01:12:56.275]  He's an actor and everything else, and he's a hero to me.
[01:12:56.936 --> 01:13:04.020]  And I remember a caller said, you know, he did the 1968 Gun Control Act television ads that the government and the NRA put on.
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:05.481]  And I said, you liar!
[01:13:05.601 --> 01:13:07.582]  And the guy sent me a video of it.
[01:13:07.602 --> 01:13:08.443]  It's somewhere around here.
[01:13:08.703 --> 01:13:10.404]  I haven't seen it on YouTube yet.
[01:13:10.844 --> 01:13:12.125]  If somebody's got that, get it up.
[01:13:12.145 --> 01:13:14.627]  You don't understand.
[01:13:14.647 --> 01:13:16.808]  We've now got two storage buildings full of videos.
[01:13:17.549 --> 01:13:22.130]  I used to, it was just me, so they're not properly labeled or... I've got to get interns to go through it all.
[01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:25.991]  There's absolute gold in there to disprove, you know, the New World Order system.
[01:13:27.691 --> 01:13:32.512]  So then I found out that Charlton Hefton really was a gun control and still is!
[01:13:33.213 --> 01:13:34.353]  It was all a black op!
[01:13:36.653 --> 01:13:37.714]  He was a hero to me!
[01:13:38.634 --> 01:13:39.314]  I interviewed him!
[01:13:44.988 --> 01:13:48.071]  And then his wife, when he finally got Alzheimer's, said, oh, he really was in for that.
[01:13:48.131 --> 01:13:49.853]  Yeah, guns need to be controlled, that interview.
[01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:51.254]  And he sat there going, yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am.
[01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:53.136]  Obviously drugged up next to her.
[01:13:55.618 --> 01:13:56.979]  But let me just digress here.
[01:13:57.019 --> 01:14:08.890]  I'm going to get into Saddam, but I'm digressing because to know that they passed the 68, to know they were the ones that, quote, it's not a compromise, they brought it forward for the Brady Bill.
[01:14:10.316 --> 01:14:14.580]  To know that they're behind the new one that's gonna take guns from cops and the military.
[01:14:15.761 --> 01:14:18.283]  After they have post-traumatic stress or anybody with ADHD.
[01:14:19.344 --> 01:14:20.225]  And it's in the bill!
[01:14:22.126 --> 01:14:23.227]  Gun owners will tell you.
[01:14:23.467 --> 01:14:25.369]  NRA's got four and a half million members.
[01:14:25.769 --> 01:14:27.351]  Gun owners has got a hundred and thirty.
[01:14:27.671 --> 01:14:28.692]  And gun owners is real.
[01:14:28.892 --> 01:14:29.973]  It can barely pay its bills.
[01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:34.972]  And then I want to just start getting on air and just start saying, send them money, send them money.
[01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:39.473]  Just to try to... I mean... They're... I just... They're gonna take our guns!
[01:14:39.713 --> 01:14:41.334]  Do you love the NRA more?
[01:14:41.914 --> 01:14:44.675]  Or can you admit as neocons out there that you've been conned?
[01:14:44.975 --> 01:14:49.256]  Can you get upset like I did when I found out... I told that caller he was a liar.
[01:14:49.496 --> 01:14:57.599]  And he mailed me on VHS tape the television ads with Charlton Heston saying 68 Gun Control Act.
[01:15:00.183 --> 01:15:07.605]  Now, do you love that Second Amendment and Granddaddy's shotgun more than you love the fake memory of someone who was a betrayer?
[01:15:07.625 --> 01:15:10.465]  Who was a Judas coat?
[01:15:12.085 --> 01:15:13.166]  I'm asking you that!
[01:15:15.006 --> 01:15:16.786]  Do you want to keep the Second Amendment?
[01:15:18.227 --> 01:15:19.727]  Or do you want to get fooled?
[01:15:24.768 --> 01:15:26.808]  The NRA's expert at lying to you.
[01:15:26.949 --> 01:15:29.129]  It's good members and making you think everything's alright.
[01:15:31.187 --> 01:15:35.510]  You think the government can really keep all this gun control going with a 4 plus million strong group?
[01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:35.750]  No!
[01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:37.271]  They're the authors of it!
[01:15:38.712 --> 01:15:39.592]  They're behind it!
[01:15:39.793 --> 01:15:41.213]  They're not just letting it happen!
[01:15:41.233 --> 01:15:44.576]  And I just get angry, man!
[01:15:45.876 --> 01:15:46.977]  We don't need to lose!
[01:15:47.237 --> 01:15:48.338]  We don't need to fail!
[01:15:48.538 --> 01:15:50.379]  We don't need to let them do all this to us!
[01:15:54.242 --> 01:15:56.003]  And it's the same thing with Saddam Hussein.
[01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:09.567]  Folks, I mean, frankly, in the past, I'm a hunting, tobacco-chewing, monster-truck-driving, brawling, beer-drinking redneck.
[01:16:10.367 --> 01:16:16.810]  I mean, I sat there eating pizza with my buddies in high school, giving high-fives when they were blowing up Baghdad in 1991.
[01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:24.313]  But I became informed, and I found out the truth, and I'm a real conservative, and you aren't.
[01:16:24.873 --> 01:16:27.434]  Now, you can join us any day you want.
[01:16:28.129 --> 01:16:34.191]  You can start winning and start defeating the New World Order any day you don't want to be pacified and sidetracked.
[01:16:35.211 --> 01:16:40.313]  You can come in for the big win in the fight against the New World Order, or you can keep being an idiot.
[01:16:41.593 --> 01:16:45.674]  But let me give you the historical fact, and don't give me your Pentagon propaganda they put down your throat.
[01:16:45.914 --> 01:16:47.855]  This is what they admit they did.
[01:16:48.055 --> 01:16:50.776]  They hired Saddam in 1958 as a CIA asset.
[01:16:51.916 --> 01:16:54.777]  He committed assassinations all over the Middle East, but mainly in Iraq.
[01:16:55.057 --> 01:16:57.738]  They told the Ba'athists we'll stop after he wounded the President.
[01:16:58.525 --> 01:16:59.586]  Uh, he shot the president up.
[01:16:59.627 --> 01:17:02.590]  They said, if you make him the head of security, we'll stop and we'll make a deal with you.
[01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:12.161]  The Ba'athists made a deal because they were on the edge of being overthrown, and back then we had an evil government, but a smart government, and it knew to leave the apparatchik in, just have an internal deal that was made, and not overthrow him.
[01:17:12.421 --> 01:17:17.687]  Then they went from being socialist-leaning to being, you know, pro-US, supposedly anti-communist.
[01:17:18.749 --> 01:17:22.291]  Then they went ahead and staged a coup in 1979, put Saddam Hussein in.
[01:17:22.851 --> 01:17:37.517]  Three years later, they give him 30 plus billion dollars, fund the whole lot with the CIA there as advisors, with Marines there as advisors, where to spray with the helicopters, how to spray the nerve gas, what to do, the weapons, everything to attack the Iranians.
[01:17:37.757 --> 01:17:39.338]  The Iranians lose a million and a half.
[01:17:39.578 --> 01:17:40.499]  The Iraqis lose over 400,000.
[01:17:41.279 --> 01:17:46.843]  Saddam leads them in frontline combat, folks, with nerve gas flying around with a gas mask on.
[01:17:46.863 --> 01:17:47.583]  The guy's tough.
[01:17:47.883 --> 01:17:48.504]  He was tough.
[01:17:48.524 --> 01:17:51.585]  He wasn't one of these little weasels, like Bush, back in the back of the fight.
[01:17:52.826 --> 01:17:53.206]  Okay?
[01:17:53.286 --> 01:17:55.668]  Frontline, hardcore trench warfare.
[01:17:55.688 --> 01:17:57.169]  Saddam Hussein at the frontline.
[01:17:57.949 --> 01:17:58.310]  Okay?
[01:18:01.471 --> 01:18:06.495]  I remember my mama chopping up carrots, and it was on TV, the great Saddam Hussein for the U.S.
[01:18:06.555 --> 01:18:07.155]  fighting Iran.
[01:18:08.112 --> 01:18:08.892]  I don't remember at all.
[01:18:09.133 --> 01:18:12.194]  Then they'd say, we've never been at war with East Asia, we've always been at war with East Asia.
[01:18:12.394 --> 01:18:15.336]  War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is bliss, whatever.
[01:18:16.397 --> 01:18:17.577]  I mean, this is what they're doing.
[01:18:19.238 --> 01:18:31.545]  And then, he's done all this and they tell him in 1990, they're mad at him for... Now we're up to the last 17 years, we'll go through that when we get back, and we'll walk through the big development.
[01:18:31.985 --> 01:18:33.386]  The big development.
[01:18:33.826 --> 01:18:35.847]  I'm going to walk through this and give you the background.
[01:18:36.889 --> 01:18:39.293]  And then I want to tell you what we're doing is good.
[01:18:39.313 --> 01:18:40.975]  Alright?
[01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:42.798]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.308 --> 01:18:58.533]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:18:58.673 --> 01:19:06.780]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:14.086]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:19:14.266 --> 01:19:15.547]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:19:15.627 --> 01:19:21.531]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:19:21.691 --> 01:19:26.794]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:19:26.914 --> 01:19:35.780]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:39.342]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:41.784]  We're good.
[01:19:52.859 --> 01:19:55.140]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:05.503]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[01:20:05.983 --> 01:20:11.524]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[01:20:11.564 --> 01:20:14.425]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July.
[01:20:15.225 --> 01:20:20.767]  With falls of $32 billion in the last two weeks alone, could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[01:20:21.710 --> 01:20:28.816]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency, and the quality of the dollar is poor, because the quantity is so high.
[01:20:29.196 --> 01:20:34.981]  Printing money on a thin air has disastrous results, victimizing middle class citizens and discouraging savings.
[01:20:35.542 --> 01:20:40.045]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[01:20:40.446 --> 01:20:43.008]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[01:20:43.488 --> 01:20:45.649]  Call me, Tom Andrew at 1-800-606-1294.
[01:20:47.150 --> 01:20:52.012]  That's 1-800-606-1294.
[01:20:52.952 --> 01:20:54.013]  Hey, Jack Blood here.
[01:20:54.233 --> 01:21:00.236]  I think that if we could see the germs' potential biohazards all around us in our daily surroundings, we would turn into Howard Hughes.
[01:21:00.536 --> 01:21:04.738]  We try not to think about it primarily because we might think there's nothing we can do about it.
[01:21:05.038 --> 01:21:05.798]  Not so fast.
[01:21:05.878 --> 01:21:07.159]  Now there is a solution.
[01:21:07.339 --> 01:21:11.361]  I'm talking about Hazurid Complete Protection Kit, available now at Hazurid.com.
[01:21:12.601 --> 01:21:21.303]  This is the single solution that is tame enough to safely conquer everyday household and business cleaning chores, yet strong enough to decontaminate biological hazards.
[01:21:21.503 --> 01:21:26.004]  Hazurid fights infectious disease and unsurpassed odor, mold, and allergens.

[01:21:38.328 --> 01:21:38.548]  That's 800-675-0323.

[01:21:39.790 --> 01:21:40.491]  H-A-Z-A-R-I-D, hazard.com.
[01:21:40.531 --> 01:21:41.712]  Tell them Jack Blood sent you.
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:54.361]  It's not a matter of if, but when.
[01:21:54.721 --> 01:21:58.083]  If it happens, you want to be ready to give your loved ones a fighting chance.
[01:21:58.363 --> 01:22:02.806]  Do not rely on someone else to come through for you at a time when it could be about life and death.
[01:22:03.206 --> 01:22:08.169]  Your best chance is Safe Castle Royal, the premier crisis preparedness buyer's club out there.

[01:22:59.251 --> 01:23:07.113]  In 1814 we took a little trip along the Colonel's Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[01:23:07.153 --> 01:23:12.554]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[01:23:12.574 --> 01:23:15.274]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[01:23:15.294 --> 01:23:17.694]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[01:23:17.755 --> 01:23:20.415]  We fired once more and they began to run it.
[01:23:20.655 --> 01:23:21.336]  Welcome back!
[01:23:21.396 --> 01:23:23.097]  Alright, the history of Saddam Hussein.
[01:23:23.177 --> 01:23:25.318]  Then in 1990, the famous video of April Gillespie, the U.S.
[01:23:25.618 --> 01:23:27.119]  Ambassador to Iraq.
[01:23:41.846 --> 01:23:47.908]  He says, well, Kuwait is slant drilling and stealing hundreds of billions of dollars of oil from us.
[01:23:48.448 --> 01:23:49.428]  And she said, yes, we know.
[01:23:49.448 --> 01:23:57.151]  And he said, well, I'm probably going to go and take some of their territory and, you know, to stop those fields that are a few miles over the border from doing it.
[01:23:57.171 --> 01:23:58.731]  And she said, hey, we're allies with you.
[01:23:59.252 --> 01:24:00.872]  We don't get involved in inter-Arab affairs.
[01:24:00.912 --> 01:24:02.893]  He says, well, we're going to invade.
[01:24:02.913 --> 01:24:03.833]  She said, well, thank you.
[01:24:04.533 --> 01:24:05.274]  We won't get involved.
[01:24:05.314 --> 01:24:06.054]  And he said, all right.
[01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:09.535]  He'd already gone to war with Iran with our backing.
[01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:15.415]  So, uh, he went in, did all those things, they had PR firms, this is now admitted U.S.
[01:24:15.435 --> 01:24:24.064]  government propaganda, they admit it was propaganda, and they were throwing babies out of incubators, it was totally made up, and all the rest of it, because you see Saddam had fallen out of favor.
[01:24:24.624 --> 01:24:28.128]  The IMF and World Bank then wanted to fully control the country and have him as a puppet,
[01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:31.151]  He said, no, I'm going to pay my debts.
[01:24:31.191 --> 01:24:36.555]  I'm going to pay the $30-something million out of the U.S., BCCI, I'm going to owe the other $20-something million I owe to the IMF and World Bank.
[01:24:37.175 --> 01:24:38.656]  And he started pumping oil like mad.
[01:24:38.676 --> 01:24:43.520]  And fuel prices, depending on where you were in the country, were $0.85 to $0.90 a gallon.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.101]  Remember that in 1990?
[01:24:45.141 --> 01:24:46.282]  There were headlines all over.
[01:24:46.302 --> 01:24:48.203]  I was a CNN addict even then.
[01:24:48.223 --> 01:24:55.148]  And even as a, you know, latter teen, I remember Saddam Hussein over-pumping.
[01:24:55.208 --> 01:24:55.929]  OPEC is upset.
[01:24:56.821 --> 01:25:03.307]  And he wasn't sophisticated enough to understand that they were luring him into going into Kuwait while that was happening.
[01:25:04.468 --> 01:25:13.676]  And he went into Kuwait, they PR'd it, then they said Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm, then they blew up all the chemical weapons plants, blew up Israel weapons systems.
[01:25:14.356 --> 01:25:17.619]  But Bush's advisors said, we don't have the force right now to go hold it and keep it.
[01:25:18.288 --> 01:25:20.088]  And so they held it till on down the line.
[01:25:20.229 --> 01:25:26.850]  And at the very same time, the Israelis, the Pentagon, had a plan to go in, to turn it into a third world country from first world.
[01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:34.832]  They bombed its entire infrastructure, water treatment, power plants, colleges, anything that could, quote, supply military technologies.
[01:25:34.852 --> 01:25:37.533]  And that was anything past light bulb level.
[01:25:38.933 --> 01:25:41.054]  They wouldn't let them have hoses for their dental chairs.
[01:25:41.094 --> 01:25:43.434]  They wouldn't let them have any factory equipment, nothing.
[01:25:43.454 --> 01:25:45.915]  And then they took all the major borders over,
[01:25:46.872 --> 01:25:49.053]  Two-thirds of the country couldn't have airline flight.
[01:25:49.934 --> 01:25:50.794]  Total control.
[01:25:51.414 --> 01:25:56.017]  But the globalists were worried that the Shiites might be strong enough to attack Saddam and overthrow him.
[01:25:56.217 --> 01:25:57.057]  This has now come out.
[01:25:57.318 --> 01:26:00.119]  So they tricked them into attacking so Saddam could dominate them.
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:08.624]  And they also tried to destabilize the Kurds, let the Turks go in against them so they wouldn't get too strong.
[01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:10.184]  They wanted to de-industrialize.
[01:26:10.545 --> 01:26:11.105]  Broke down.
[01:26:13.197 --> 01:26:16.140]  And this has all come out now, that they intended to attack Iraq day one.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:20.303]  The PNAC document written by Dick Cheney, September 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[01:26:20.343 --> 01:26:23.786]  Dick Cheney says, Saddam isn't a threat, but we'll say he is.
[01:26:23.806 --> 01:26:25.427]  And this is how dumb they think we are.
[01:26:25.487 --> 01:26:26.228]  We won't read this stuff.
[01:26:27.157 --> 01:26:31.341]  All we need is the right pretext, a new Pearl Harbor to help us get into there.
[01:26:31.361 --> 01:26:33.223]  Then we'll use it to go into Iran and Syria.
[01:26:33.483 --> 01:26:45.013]  We'll build permanent bases and then oversee three to four different blocks, as they're now officially saying they're going to do, breaking it into sectarian areas, playing the three parts against each other to ensure continued civil war.
[01:26:45.553 --> 01:26:48.196]  Then they'll have warlord chiefs to control the three to four sectors.
[01:26:49.774 --> 01:26:53.776]  And then they would basically just carry out genocide from there.
[01:26:54.157 --> 01:27:09.806]  We're 17 years into bombing, bombardment, starvation, third world level, now worse than most nations even in the third world, cholera killing thousands every year, I mean that is a super third world disease, no water treatment, sewage now dumped in the streets,
[01:27:10.346 --> 01:27:12.307]  It is back to Stone Age level.
[01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:15.067]  Power about three hours a day in Baghdad.
[01:27:15.667 --> 01:27:18.048]  Only running water in the green zone of inequality.
[01:27:18.808 --> 01:27:23.309]  Prenatal record deaths, even worse than areas of Central Africa.
[01:27:24.589 --> 01:27:26.410]  Just absolute carnage.
[01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:30.270]  700 plus thousand dead Iraqis in the first three years.
[01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:32.031]  Now well over a million.
[01:27:32.051 --> 01:27:33.871]  Those are major medical journals.
[01:27:34.811 --> 01:27:35.212]  The U.S.
[01:27:35.252 --> 01:27:36.532]  Medical Journal said no, it's not 600 and
[01:27:39.062 --> 01:27:40.564]  Well, 50-something thousand is more like 700,000.
[01:27:40.824 --> 01:27:42.146]  That was the first three years.
[01:27:42.166 --> 01:27:44.028]  We're now four years, four months into it.
[01:27:44.048 --> 01:27:45.770]  I don't know how long it was March.
[01:27:45.810 --> 01:27:46.551]  Yeah, four months ago.
[01:27:46.991 --> 01:27:48.853]  So, all of that is going on.
[01:27:49.834 --> 01:27:51.977]  Just absolute extermination happening.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.722]  I guess four years and five months.
[01:27:57.823 --> 01:27:59.405]  And that was the plan all along!
[01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:03.892]  Then they claimed, oh, we had detente with Saddam.
[01:28:03.932 --> 01:28:06.654]  We gave him a chance to let the inspectors do what they were doing.
[01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:09.196]  And the inspectors said, no, he let them do whatever he wanted.
[01:28:09.736 --> 01:28:13.418]  Which, again, even though they went with that model, it's you in control which destroys sovereignty.
[01:28:14.319 --> 01:28:17.321]  And we'll bring you up to the new news when we get back.
[01:28:19.182 --> 01:28:23.725]  Saddam offered exile, but neocons unleash carnage anyway.
[01:28:24.286 --> 01:28:25.386]  What could have been saved?
[01:28:25.466 --> 01:28:26.287]  A trillion dollars?
[01:28:26.307 --> 01:28:27.168]  A million lives?
[01:28:27.188 --> 01:28:29.009]  The global reputation of the U.S.? ?
[01:28:29.818 --> 01:28:31.599]  But that wasn't the plan.
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:34.661]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:28:35.662 --> 01:28:36.863]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:42.586 --> 01:28:43.527]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.987 --> 01:28:45.608]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.509 --> 01:28:49.231]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.409 --> 01:28:52.950]  Hey, Emily!
[01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:54.111]  Wow, you look great!
[01:28:54.331 --> 01:28:55.131]  I feel great!
[01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:57.153]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:28:57.453 --> 01:28:57.754]  Really?
[01:28:57.974 --> 01:28:58.394]  What is it?
[01:28:58.595 --> 01:28:59.075]  How does it work?
[01:28:59.275 --> 01:29:05.861]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[01:29:06.001 --> 01:29:08.303]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:29:08.503 --> 01:29:13.828]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:29:14.148 --> 01:29:14.629]  That's it?
[01:29:14.909 --> 01:29:16.451]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:29:16.691 --> 01:29:17.412]  It is easy.
[01:29:17.613 --> 01:29:24.321]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:29:24.601 --> 01:29:26.123]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:29:26.424 --> 01:29:27.145]  That's amazing!
[01:29:27.545 --> 01:29:32.892]  And, the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:29:33.212 --> 01:29:33.533]  Wow!
[01:29:33.753 --> 01:29:34.854]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[01:29:35.134 --> 01:29:37.977]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.

[01:29:45.866 --> 01:29:46.146]  Call today.
[01:29:52.410 --> 01:29:55.853]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:29:56.073 --> 01:29:58.215]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:29:58.355 --> 01:30:00.817]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:30:01.057 --> 01:30:05.420]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:06.141]  Here is why.
[01:30:06.541 --> 01:30:12.485]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:30:12.726 --> 01:30:18.730]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:19.891]  But they're not cheating.
[01:30:20.111 --> 01:30:24.094]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:30:24.294 --> 01:30:28.636]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:30:28.736 --> 01:30:36.081]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:30:36.121 --> 01:30:36.381]  We're good.
[01:30:52.378 --> 01:30:57.323]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:30:57.643 --> 01:30:59.525]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[01:30:59.725 --> 01:31:02.768]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:31:02.948 --> 01:31:06.091]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:31:06.391 --> 01:31:08.233]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:31:08.513 --> 01:31:12.214]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:31:12.494 --> 01:31:15.155]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[01:31:15.775 --> 01:31:20.057]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[01:31:20.277 --> 01:31:24.558]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:31:24.958 --> 01:31:29.300]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:33.861]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[01:31:34.181 --> 01:31:36.842]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy.
[01:31:37.082 --> 01:31:37.863]  Some folks are born!
[01:32:06.985 --> 01:32:10.567]  Some folks are born to make the way to fly.
[01:32:10.748 --> 01:32:14.450]  Ooh, the red, white, and blue.
[01:32:14.970 --> 01:32:16.671]  The red, white, and blue.
[01:32:16.691 --> 01:32:17.432]  Yeah.
[01:32:17.472 --> 01:32:20.613]  And when the band plays, hell to the teeth.
[01:32:20.813 --> 01:32:24.476]  Lord knows, they point the cannon at you.
[01:32:24.536 --> 01:32:28.378]  Tell them that your name ain't me.
[01:32:29.028 --> 01:32:34.951]  It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no sinner, that's fine.
[01:32:35.051 --> 01:32:42.134]  It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one.
[01:32:52.737 --> 01:32:56.403]  Lord, don't they have themselves?
[01:32:56.443 --> 01:32:59.087]  Don't they have themselves?
[01:32:59.147 --> 01:33:06.738]  The Jackman give him the key to the land There wasn't far enough left for school and hell, yeah
[01:33:11.082 --> 01:33:12.523]  It ain't me, no.
[01:33:12.683 --> 01:33:16.885]  I ain't no millionaire's son.
[01:33:16.965 --> 01:33:18.846]  It ain't me, no.
[01:33:20.066 --> 01:33:21.367]  It ain't me, no.
[01:33:21.527 --> 01:33:23.348]  I ain't no fortunate one.
[01:33:23.468 --> 01:33:31.652]  The folks I know in Harris, Los Angeles, I don't need to spin you.
[01:33:41.984 --> 01:33:44.425]  We're good to go.
[01:34:10.824 --> 01:34:14.046]  We have the answer.
[01:34:15.046 --> 01:34:17.848]  We have it.
[01:34:18.168 --> 01:34:19.468]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:34:19.628 --> 01:34:22.350]  Secret, secret service.
[01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:24.431]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:34:25.071 --> 01:34:29.573]  I don't know what you're waiting for.
[01:34:29.653 --> 01:34:30.954]  No, no, no, no.
[01:34:31.214 --> 01:34:33.335]  And we have it.
[01:34:36.428 --> 01:34:38.530]  What a great song!
[01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:42.113]  Welcome back.
[01:34:42.253 --> 01:34:49.460]  Alright, so we've gotten up to the point.
[01:35:00.758 --> 01:35:12.324]  Saddam Hussein goes into Kuwait, not defending it, CIA asset, doing his own thing, won't let the IMF and World Bank own the country, pumping too much oil, driving down the prices for the oil companies and the other Arabs.
[01:35:14.785 --> 01:35:22.189]  They come in, and the bombardment starts and has now gone on for 17 years.
[01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:27.512]  There were 25 million Iraqis in the global census in 1990, there are 22 million now.
[01:35:30.459 --> 01:35:31.519]  3 million went bye-bye.
[01:35:31.579 --> 01:35:33.520]  You can debate where they went, how they died.
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:35.921]  Their population going down.
[01:35:36.301 --> 01:35:40.362]  And by the way, their population more than doubled from the 50s through 1990.
[01:35:40.702 --> 01:35:43.063]  They were an up-and-coming nation.
[01:35:43.103 --> 01:35:44.283]  Well, not now.
[01:35:44.884 --> 01:35:46.644]  They're being exterminated, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:46.664 --> 01:35:56.967]  In fact, if you look at population growth numbers, they should have increased at least another 5 million to 30 million, but now they are 22 million and racing downwards.
[01:35:57.007 --> 01:35:58.648]  That number is about two years old, by the way.
[01:36:00.311 --> 01:36:04.114]  So, uh, the operation is going very well.
[01:36:04.414 --> 01:36:07.656]  The official Israeli plans, published in Israeli papers as early as 1983.
[01:36:07.816 --> 01:36:08.016]  U.S.
[01:36:08.056 --> 01:36:09.557]  plans, published as early as 1990.
[01:36:10.658 --> 01:36:14.460]  Shed the plan for the entire Middle East, as each nation broken into multiple parts.
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:16.942]  Some nations, like Iran, as many as six parts.
[01:36:17.022 --> 01:36:17.922]  Iraq, three to four.
[01:36:18.203 --> 01:36:19.243]  They're now settling on three.
[01:36:21.365 --> 01:36:24.947]  And they're gonna go in and blow out the infrastructure of each one, just like Serbia.
[01:36:25.387 --> 01:36:26.628]  Break it up in several parts.
[01:36:27.288 --> 01:36:29.490]  And then just run extermination ops from there.
[01:36:30.945 --> 01:36:39.288]  Then they give the troops their own domestic propaganda about, you're helping the people, hand them candy, you're helping them, you're great Americans, the insurgency's evil, blah blah blah.
[01:36:39.568 --> 01:36:47.612]  Meanwhile, the Pentagon's own plans shed, we're going to disband the military, the Iraqi military, disband the system, the civil servants, and it'll totally unravel.
[01:36:48.432 --> 01:36:53.854]  Now see, that's in one set for strategy wonks up at the top, the gurus at the war colleges.
[01:36:53.894 --> 01:36:54.694]  That's for them!
[01:36:55.235 --> 01:36:58.656]  Then they have domestic propaganda for the population for the troops!
[01:36:59.525 --> 01:37:05.388]  And that's why Neocon's listing right now feel real good, or, you know, I, uh, we're helping fight them over there.
[01:37:05.448 --> 01:37:07.229]  Fight Al-Qaeda there instead of over here.
[01:37:07.609 --> 01:37:13.111]  We wanted to bring them water and food, but darn Al-Qaeda blew everything up!
[01:37:17.894 --> 01:37:27.238]  By the way, so no one would fight for Saddam, I even saw it on the show the week before they invaded, go, don't worry, we've paid off three of the major army groups and the major Republican Guard commander, they're gonna stand down.
[01:37:29.036 --> 01:37:32.577]  Now, of course, they then also, as soon as they got in, though, they'd been told they were going to take over again.
[01:37:33.677 --> 01:37:34.637]  The Iraqi Guard was.
[01:37:34.717 --> 01:37:36.298]  They were turned loose and fired.
[01:37:36.698 --> 01:37:39.638]  But then actual Baathist criminals at the top were kept in.
[01:37:39.658 --> 01:37:41.299]  The very ones you should have got rid of, they didn't.
[01:37:41.639 --> 01:37:42.499]  It was very sick.
[01:37:42.839 --> 01:37:44.879]  It was the opposite of what you do when you really take over.
[01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:51.261]  When the Nazis took over the French, they put the military right back in control and then ran it out of Vichy.
[01:37:51.881 --> 01:37:56.982]  But it was when you saw civil servants or you saw the bureaucracy, it was 99% the same people.
[01:37:57.182 --> 01:37:58.162]  And there wasn't a revolt.
[01:37:59.522 --> 01:38:02.324]  The Romans had that figured out 2,200 years ago.
[01:38:03.285 --> 01:38:06.107]  The Babylonians had it figured out 2,500 years ago.
[01:38:08.228 --> 01:38:11.191]  And the Pentagon didn't just do things we know wouldn't work.
[01:38:11.431 --> 01:38:12.051]  It did work!
[01:38:12.151 --> 01:38:19.596]  They meant to balkanize, break down, and exterminate those people, and make sure they go back to being Stone Age, like you hear the neocons say every day.
[01:38:22.438 --> 01:38:25.941]  So little kids can walk around and get swollen bellies full of liquid.
[01:38:26.733 --> 01:38:29.616]  And so they can get a cold and flop over and die from it!
[01:38:29.856 --> 01:38:31.657]  And get buried in a shallow grave!
[01:38:33.599 --> 01:38:41.426]  One person during the first months of the occupation fires at them from a 2,000 acre giant date and tangerine grove.
[01:38:42.026 --> 01:38:46.771]  The army goes in there with the engineers and burns it down and bulldozes every bit of it.
[01:38:46.791 --> 01:38:50.634]  And the people literally go sit down on the side of the street and say, I'm sitting down to die.
[01:38:52.156 --> 01:38:53.017]  That wasn't enough, though.
[01:38:53.037 --> 01:39:00.903]  They grab every man in every one of those little towns, and they take them, everybody down to the age of 11, and they take them in for raping and torture and killin'.
[01:39:01.664 --> 01:39:04.906]  And they got big ol' mass graves they just bulldoze them right into.
[01:39:04.967 --> 01:39:07.889]  That's been in mainstream news, but kept real quiet, back of the paper.
[01:39:10.094 --> 01:39:11.576]  Now that's what goes on over there.
[01:39:12.216 --> 01:39:13.678]  Now let me give you the larger system.
[01:39:14.119 --> 01:39:16.561]  We go in for the big banks in America based in Europe.
[01:39:16.601 --> 01:39:17.342]  We blow it out.
[01:39:17.382 --> 01:39:18.183]  We break it down.
[01:39:18.423 --> 01:39:21.387]  We play the part of the bad cop like the Soviets did in the last century.
[01:39:21.667 --> 01:39:27.874]  We go in and we stall and everybody hates us and we collapse and fall apart and the new good cop is the Euro.
[01:39:30.129 --> 01:39:55.420]  And sure enough, I'm seeing editorials, as I said they would ten years ago, because I read PNAC documents, because there are people that run PNAC, I read CFR documents, and I read documents out of the Trilateral Commission, where they said they'd launch the euro in 2000, it would debase the dollar, then they'd say, look how good the euro is, let's go to our own regional currency, then they'll play those two up against each other, and then go to a global peg currency.
[01:39:56.886 --> 01:40:01.031]  We told folks that the new carbon tax, Kyoto wasn't going to stop there.
[01:40:01.051 --> 01:40:15.306]  It was going to be a tax on oil, a tax on fuel, a tax on big houses, a tax on boats, a tax on cars, a tax on lawnmowers, a tax on everything, a whole new system of federal taxation paying internationally.
[01:40:15.526 --> 01:40:16.848]  It's AP Reuters today.
[01:40:17.651 --> 01:40:18.311]  You laughed at me.
[01:40:18.631 --> 01:40:20.012]  Rush Limbaugh said it didn't exist.
[01:40:20.332 --> 01:40:21.852]  North American Union doesn't exist.
[01:40:22.113 --> 01:40:28.155]  Again, the NRA, fake conservative shows, they're all there to pacify you so they're able to get all this through.
[01:40:30.135 --> 01:40:35.517]  By the way, we got a couple ISDN lines in here to the office and about 30 minutes ago they both cut out.
[01:40:36.437 --> 01:40:38.118]  So our AM and FM stations can hear us.
[01:40:38.138 --> 01:40:39.058]  The satellites are up.
[01:40:39.338 --> 01:40:44.260]  That's all at network backups, but you can only have three or four thousand listeners instead of
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:45.620]  We're good to go.
[01:41:09.255 --> 01:41:12.517]  You ever heard me go into the middle of the second hour without taking calls or cover?
[01:41:12.537 --> 01:41:23.061]  I mean, this is just, it's all coming together right now, and Murphy's Law would have it, that our ISDN lines, which are, not ISDN, T1s, that are fully paid up, were turned off downtown.
[01:41:25.542 --> 01:41:31.805]  We're figuring out what's going on with that, but, first of all, they got backups, but, this kind of stuff happens.
[01:41:32.746 --> 01:41:37.548]  I guess I'll just buy more backups, but then, you won't like it, because I gotta have another sponsor!
[01:41:38.812 --> 01:41:50.377]  ISDN lines and satellites and short waves six hours a day and webmasters and 678 servers and content distribution networks don't grow on apple trees, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:55.919 --> 01:41:56.399]  But that's it.
[01:41:56.419 --> 01:41:57.700]  I'm getting even more backup stuff.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.461]  And by the way, he said we were going to launch a new website.
[01:41:59.481 --> 01:42:02.922]  We're launching a new one, a new news website next week with Curt and Emo at the helm.
[01:42:04.082 --> 01:42:05.283]  We got hacked a few months ago.
[01:42:07.205 --> 01:42:12.490]  We've launched a new in-game website, and we're launching a whole new news website, updated 7 days a week, next week.
[01:42:13.991 --> 01:42:18.296]  And because of this happening, which we don't believe is an attack, it's just Murphy's Law, we're going to increase.
[01:42:19.016 --> 01:42:19.637]  This is what we do.
[01:42:19.657 --> 01:42:21.118]  When we're attacked, we get stronger.
[01:42:21.298 --> 01:42:22.700]  When we have problems, we get stronger.
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:24.962]  When we screw up, we just redouble our efforts.
[01:42:33.064 --> 01:42:37.748]  I got great IT people, but what I need and what I've sought is someone who can be here at this office.
[01:42:40.410 --> 01:42:41.951]  This is too important of a broadcast.
[01:42:43.253 --> 01:42:47.116]  Alright, so here's the big news that I've been rambling about up to this point.
[01:42:50.058 --> 01:42:52.780]  And then I'm just going to wall-to-wall take calls and play clips for the next hour.
[01:42:53.701 --> 01:42:58.145]  Saddam offered exile, but neocons unleash carnage anyway.
[01:42:59.685 --> 01:43:01.567]  What would have been saved?
[01:43:01.627 --> 01:43:02.388]  A trillion dollars?
[01:43:02.408 --> 01:43:03.268]  A million lives?
[01:43:03.749 --> 01:43:05.190]  The global reputation of the U.S.?
[01:43:05.530 --> 01:43:07.172]  But that wasn't the plan.
[01:43:07.612 --> 01:43:24.888]  Now, all the data and all the knowledge and all the information I just gave you that can be backed up, that the globalists cynically meant to go in there and destroy our name, that was one part, to sell hundreds of billions in no-bid weapons contracts to make over a trillion, two hundred billion so far, with at least double that in the next ten years,
[01:43:25.592 --> 01:43:28.394]  The Pentagon plan was to never leave, officially released now.
[01:43:28.774 --> 01:43:31.456]  They lied to the public and said the troops would be back by Christmas.
[01:43:32.097 --> 01:43:36.099]  They disbanded the military over there and the civil servants by design to have it unravel.
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:39.242]  They officially planned that, but you won't go researching as neocons.
[01:43:40.022 --> 01:43:41.383]  You just want to keep going along with it.
[01:43:42.724 --> 01:43:46.847]  And believe in the Pentagon's propaganda, very anti-American, very cynical, very wicked.
[01:43:48.888 --> 01:43:52.451]  All of that now, and remember, it came out in The London Guardian.
[01:43:53.363 --> 01:43:54.444]  AP, a couple places.
[01:43:54.484 --> 01:43:56.826]  Remember they said a week before, Saddam, you can leave.
[01:43:58.247 --> 01:43:58.887]  You can leave.
[01:43:59.688 --> 01:44:02.610]  You can go anywhere you want, and you can even take money with you.
[01:44:05.092 --> 01:44:09.295]  And then I remember reading reports that they had fighter jets scrambled and waiting to shoot him down and kill him.
[01:44:12.698 --> 01:44:19.163]  Now they let Saddam Hussein, their asset, their hireling, the guy they set up, I'm not defending him, but compared to the Saudis, he's a little angel.
[01:44:19.603 --> 01:44:20.464]  So are the Iranians.
[01:44:21.925 --> 01:44:22.966]  He's an angel compared to them.
[01:44:25.288 --> 01:44:31.814]  He said, okay, let me have 500,000 pounds, which would have been about 900 million dollars.
[01:44:32.234 --> 01:44:39.581]  Now, the war officially costs, currently, per day, not what it's going to cost in medical bills and things later, 786 million dollars.
[01:44:39.601 --> 01:44:40.562]  That just came out Monday.
[01:44:40.942 --> 01:44:43.204]  Pentagon's own numbers.
[01:44:43.224 --> 01:44:45.466]  780 plus million dollars.
[01:44:45.506 --> 01:44:48.209]  So, basically, for a day and a couple hours.
[01:44:48.549 --> 01:44:50.471]  For the cost of a day and a couple hours.
[01:44:52.728 --> 01:44:56.971]  There could have been all over and sure, even sending U.S.
[01:44:56.991 --> 01:44:59.352]  troops to occupy and even get the oil and all that.
[01:44:59.793 --> 01:45:01.194]  No, we're not doing it that way.
[01:45:01.494 --> 01:45:02.595]  We're going to have a big war.
[01:45:02.675 --> 01:45:04.656]  Bush has got to be a big hero here domestically.
[01:45:04.956 --> 01:45:06.717]  America's got to be hit internationally.
[01:45:07.178 --> 01:45:10.460]  Over a million Iraqis, more of the 2 million already dead have to die.
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:15.343]  4,000 dead American troops that died in-country, 15,000 outside the country.
[01:45:15.363 --> 01:45:21.387]  15,000 total if you count those that died, another 11,000 that died outside the country, official numbers.
[01:45:23.263 --> 01:45:26.806]  All this has to happen so they can break it up and make it Stone Age.
[01:45:27.426 --> 01:45:29.688]  They don't want rock and roll stations and Playboy.
[01:45:30.428 --> 01:45:32.429]  When they're done, it was a secular government.
[01:45:32.449 --> 01:45:33.590]  It's now an Islamic government.
[01:45:34.911 --> 01:45:38.253]  They want them under the skirt of every mullah is the Union Jack.
[01:45:38.614 --> 01:45:43.837]  The old saying of a hundred years ago goes, because they radicalized them, used them to overthrow secular mainline governments.
[01:45:43.857 --> 01:45:47.260]  I mean, the Arabs, the Persians, they want us to go to movie theaters.
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:50.502]  They want us to sit around smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee out at cafes.
[01:45:51.423 --> 01:45:52.684]  They want to go to water parks.
[01:45:53.084 --> 01:45:54.205]  They want to go on vacations.
[01:45:54.445 --> 01:45:55.806]  They want camper trailers.
[01:45:56.067 --> 01:45:57.328]  They want to go deer hunting.
[01:45:57.728 --> 01:45:58.929]  They're just like us.
[01:45:59.089 --> 01:46:02.191]  They invented astronomy and mathematics.
[01:46:05.134 --> 01:46:14.481]  But the CIA and MI6 and British Intelligence went and they grabbed the Bedouins and they gave them machine guns and rocket launchers and they run things.
[01:46:14.741 --> 01:46:15.021]  Okay?
[01:46:15.522 --> 01:46:17.163]  Oh, you want to build big glistening cities?
[01:46:17.483 --> 01:46:19.144]  Here's some people with rocket launchers.
[01:46:19.805 --> 01:46:20.185]  Okay?
[01:46:20.566 --> 01:46:21.026]  It's over.
[01:46:23.016 --> 01:46:27.978]  Oh, you want to not even have a beard and wear a suit and have some of the best universities in the world?
[01:46:28.298 --> 01:46:31.159]  How about 10,000, 2,000 pound bombs?
[01:46:31.459 --> 01:46:32.200]  How's that sound?
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:44.024]  Oh, you want Christian churches and Jews moving back into Iraq who'd been there 50, 60 years ago before the Israelis set off bombs.
[01:46:44.044 --> 01:46:44.924]  That's declassified.
[01:46:45.265 --> 01:46:48.286]  All over Europe and all over the Middle East to make Jews leave.
[01:46:48.686 --> 01:46:50.326]  Oh, you're coming back under Saddam.
[01:46:50.507 --> 01:46:51.387]  No, you're not.
[01:46:52.039 --> 01:46:53.320]  You're not coming back, Jews.
[01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:59.262]  You're coming right here where the New Old Order can suck off of you and shave your heads and radiate your children in Israel.
[01:47:01.383 --> 01:47:10.607]  You see, but it's so diabolical, it's so diabolical that the general public cannot face the facts.
[01:47:10.647 --> 01:47:12.008]  They cannot face the facts.
[01:47:12.028 --> 01:47:14.169]  Now, you'll talk to a well-informed Neocon on an airplane.
[01:47:14.944 --> 01:47:15.324]  No, we don't!
[01:47:15.424 --> 01:47:16.845]  Of course the guy flew nukes on B-52s.
[01:47:37.481 --> 01:47:38.822]  Then he became an airline pilot.
[01:47:52.728 --> 01:47:55.710]  Our last blood to sustain them, sucking us dry.
[01:47:56.070 --> 01:48:05.297]  That's why they are attacking the Iraqis and the Persians, and that's why they're attacking the Serbs, and that's why they're attacking any sovereign African nation or any Latin American nation.
[01:48:05.997 --> 01:48:09.520]  Anybody, and I'm not even, and again, they can point and say, oh, there's a bad leader.
[01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:10.481]  Yeah, most government's evil.
[01:48:10.501 --> 01:48:11.041]  That's our point.
[01:48:11.301 --> 01:48:12.042]  Downing Father's point.
[01:48:12.242 --> 01:48:20.328]  But they can, but the evil guys in Venezuela or in Tehran are nothing compared to the people running the New World Order.
[01:48:21.128 --> 01:48:22.269]  And they can't threaten me.
[01:48:23.522 --> 01:48:31.544]  And they, by the way, have revolutions in their own countries that want liberty, and then every political scientist who looks at it says it makes Ahmadinejad a hero.
[01:48:32.264 --> 01:48:39.786]  Midliners, totally friendly to the West, were attacked and bullied until they elected Ahmadinejad.
[01:48:40.646 --> 01:48:41.886]  They're radical, comparatively.
[01:48:42.807 --> 01:48:46.988]  And by the way, when they screamed and yelled at him at that thing, it made him more popular than ever in Iran now.
[01:48:47.048 --> 01:48:48.408]  He's a hero to everybody now.
[01:48:49.148 --> 01:48:52.289]  Before, he had 40% of the vote, but in the Parliament, he could get in with that.
[01:48:53.055 --> 01:48:53.655]  Was a 41.
[01:48:56.696 --> 01:48:56.916]  See?
[01:48:58.397 --> 01:48:59.877]  Now he's a big hero.
[01:49:01.698 --> 01:49:03.258]  See, they know what they're doing.
[01:49:03.318 --> 01:49:04.578]  That's why they're in control.
[01:49:04.878 --> 01:49:09.780]  And Saddam Hussein tried to turn himself over.
[01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:11.860]  Tried to go to Spain.
[01:49:12.541 --> 01:49:20.363]  Tried to go to Northern England, right on the border with Scotland, where Tariq Aziz, the foreign minister, went.
[01:49:21.221 --> 01:49:25.344]  He now lives in one of Prince Charles's palaces for his lifetime?
[01:49:26.164 --> 01:49:27.905]  He's been given a contract and a guarantee?
[01:49:29.466 --> 01:49:30.587]  He said, look, just let me leave.
[01:49:30.627 --> 01:49:32.048]  And they said, no.
[01:49:32.588 --> 01:49:34.729]  That's for public consumption, Mac.
[01:49:35.210 --> 01:49:36.831]  And they kept it quiet.
[01:49:37.131 --> 01:49:46.056]  They intended to attack and commit mass murder and genocide and get our troops killed and destroy our good name and blow over a trillion dollars the entire time.
[01:49:46.196 --> 01:49:47.237]  Ordered out of chaos!
[01:49:55.623 --> 01:50:01.073]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.433 --> 01:50:09.087]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.764 --> 01:50:16.808]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.228 --> 01:50:28.615]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.955 --> 01:50:32.517]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:32.917 --> 01:50:34.818]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.179 --> 01:50:39.021]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:39.302 --> 01:51:40.423]  The Berkey Security Pack

[01:51:43.368 --> 01:51:44.189]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:52.046 --> 01:51:54.007]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:51:54.267 --> 01:51:57.307]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:51:57.567 --> 01:52:02.349]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:52:02.669 --> 01:52:05.409]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:52:05.649 --> 01:52:10.330]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[01:52:10.611 --> 01:52:12.511]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:52:12.971 --> 01:52:22.941]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology, and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[01:52:23.301 --> 01:52:28.026]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:52:28.366 --> 01:52:31.909]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars!
[01:52:32.150 --> 01:52:34.292]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[01:52:34.612 --> 01:52:36.754]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[01:52:36.934 --> 01:52:38.715]  We'll even refund the shipping charge!
[01:52:39.015 --> 01:52:42.137]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now!
[01:52:42.357 --> 01:52:43.258]  What are you waiting for?
[01:52:43.438 --> 01:52:44.118]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[01:52:44.319 --> 01:52:44.539]  That's 1-888-873-7371.
[01:52:44.559 --> 01:52:44.719]  Today!
[01:53:04.354 --> 01:53:11.777]  I love this republic.
[01:53:14.618 --> 01:53:19.860]  And to see us in the hands of such ruthless, sadistic individuals tears my heart out.
[01:53:21.921 --> 01:53:22.821]  And to see them take
[01:53:24.179 --> 01:53:24.979]  Good Americans.
[01:53:25.039 --> 01:53:25.839]  I know you're good.
[01:53:25.859 --> 01:53:28.940]  I know your average neocon follower is a good person.
[01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:31.941]  They fly the stars and stripes year-round.
[01:53:31.981 --> 01:53:33.141]  They feel good about the country.
[01:53:33.181 --> 01:53:34.342]  They watch football.
[01:53:34.842 --> 01:53:38.002]  They see our crew as heroes with great courage.
[01:53:38.983 --> 01:53:40.943]  But they're heroes who've been lied to.
[01:53:41.623 --> 01:53:47.985]  They're heroes who are being led by individuals who cynically only want them to carry out their evil plans.
[01:53:51.511 --> 01:54:05.283]  I'm asking you, neocons, liberals, all of you, to realize they control the left and the right, to realize they're manipulating you with public relations propaganda, to realize that they are bringing us to our very knees.
[01:54:08.146 --> 01:54:10.328]  I'm asking you right now to break your conditioning.
[01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:12.630]  I'm asking you to find out the truth.
[01:54:13.391 --> 01:54:16.694]  I'm asking you to stand up and wage war against the New World Order.
[01:54:19.617 --> 01:54:21.299]  And that is the choice, my friends.
[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:22.901]  It is literally up to you.
[01:54:22.921 --> 01:54:25.084]  It is in your hands.
[01:54:25.264 --> 01:54:33.615]  And to see this article, I'm asking you to go to PrisonPlanet.com with all the hacking and the attacking and the censoring and everything that we're under.
[01:54:33.835 --> 01:54:35.918]  MySpace has now officially admitted we got the same
[01:54:36.827 --> 01:54:38.669]  Email from Myspace, and it is from them.
[01:54:38.689 --> 01:54:40.030]  Oh, we're sorry.
[01:54:40.091 --> 01:54:42.613]  Prison Planet got added to our new spam filter.
[01:54:42.633 --> 01:54:45.236]  We buy the software with a list of spam.
[01:54:45.276 --> 01:54:54.065]  Yeah, most of the new software that you buy to keep your teenagers off hacking, porn, what are the five things they put on there?
[01:54:54.085 --> 01:54:59.831]  It's hacking, porn, gambling, and what they call hate, and then there's one other.
[01:55:01.235 --> 01:55:03.056]  Uh, what, fraud sites, that's it.
[01:55:03.497 --> 01:55:05.177]  And we're listed on all of them!
[01:55:05.378 --> 01:55:07.399]  Oh yeah, oh yeah!
[01:55:07.799 --> 01:55:16.463]  Because we'll see it in the BBC, and we'll see it in the... What was the other newspaper that this was in?
[01:55:16.483 --> 01:55:17.684]  The Daily Mail.
[01:55:18.667 --> 01:55:19.828]  Now, what do we do on the site?
[01:55:19.848 --> 01:55:23.411]  We then take you back to the history and go, here's the White House memo, declassified, public,
[01:55:47.759 --> 01:55:52.400]  By the British, where Bush was talking about staging the shoot-down of our aircraft to blame it on Saddam.
[01:55:53.780 --> 01:56:03.042]  And we go, oh, here's Bush, a video of him, claiming that he wants to make a deal with Saddam to let him leave, but it was all a fraud and it was just to make the public think he was being reasonable.
[01:56:03.443 --> 01:56:04.563]  See, lying to us!
[01:56:04.603 --> 01:56:09.744]  See, we have a memory, we have the history, and then we show you the history and we put it all together.
[01:56:10.724 --> 01:56:14.405]  Or another article, you know, we do stuff like this, there's a hoax being put out,
[01:56:15.406 --> 01:56:19.870]  Clearly to discredit those of us that are exposing that 15,000 troops have died, not 4,000.
[01:56:20.190 --> 01:56:22.733]  Well, they put out this info that 73,000 dead U.S.
[01:56:22.753 --> 01:56:23.033]  troops.
[01:56:23.453 --> 01:56:24.214]  That's not true.
[01:56:24.294 --> 01:56:35.583]  We link to the Pentagon's own documents that 73,000 troops have died since the Gulf War to now of all enlistees, the vast majority of which never rotated through Iraq.
[01:56:35.643 --> 01:56:36.544]  It's just, it's not true.
[01:56:36.604 --> 01:56:37.105]  It's a hoax.
[01:56:37.165 --> 01:56:38.085]  We expose that hoax.
[01:56:38.626 --> 01:56:39.827]  Valuable news.
[01:56:40.768 --> 01:56:42.169]  We do the best we can
[01:56:42.978 --> 01:56:44.458]  To give you a clear picture.
[01:56:44.939 --> 01:56:49.240]  Or AP reports that they've struck down two provisions of the Patriot Act.
[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:49.980]  We cover that.
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:57:00.143]  Or we bring you all these doctors and scientists and lawyers and experts and video clips and I'm an award-winning filmmaker and I've been all over national television.
[01:57:00.163 --> 01:57:03.324]  I've been in two big Hollywood productions with major roles.
[01:57:05.784 --> 01:57:07.505]  But I'm not allowed to have a Wikipedia page.
[01:57:07.525 --> 01:57:08.525]  They deleted most of them.
[01:57:08.545 --> 01:57:10.065]  They say I'm not a person of interest.
[01:57:10.085 --> 01:57:12.026]  See?
[01:57:12.066 --> 01:57:12.206]  See?
[01:57:15.072 --> 01:57:16.192]  See how this works, folks?
[01:57:16.292 --> 01:57:17.693]  Because they're afraid of us.
[01:57:17.713 --> 01:57:19.874]  They're afraid of the action we're having.
[01:57:19.894 --> 01:57:21.894]  They're afraid of the response we're getting.
[01:57:22.194 --> 01:57:23.515]  They're afraid right now.
[01:57:23.775 --> 01:57:28.416]  That's why we've got to intensify our efforts against the New World Order NOW!
[01:57:28.836 --> 01:57:29.757]  Intensify!
[01:57:29.977 --> 01:57:30.617]  Activate!

[01:57:49.746 --> 01:57:50.807]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:51.508 --> 01:57:52.609]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.269 --> 01:57:54.090]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.871 --> 01:57:55.771]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.412 --> 01:58:00.235]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.595 --> 01:58:04.679]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.133 --> 01:58:16.214]  We are now into our number three.
[01:58:16.294 --> 01:58:19.475]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:20.436 --> 01:58:27.118]  Our T1s are back up, but we didn't go down because the network had them, but half our streams did.
[01:58:27.699 --> 01:58:31.180]  If you missed any of the second hour, we're going to be restreaming it coming up.
[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:34.101]  When this show ends, we restart the show all over again.
[01:58:34.121 --> 01:58:37.903]  I want to, from the bottom of my heart, thank all of our AM and FM affiliates.
[01:58:39.051 --> 01:58:39.912]  I'm carrying the show.
[01:58:39.952 --> 01:58:41.393]  Tell everybody about those stations.
[01:58:41.713 --> 01:58:42.434]  Sponsor them.
[01:58:42.474 --> 01:58:43.575]  Support their sponsors.
[01:58:44.075 --> 01:58:46.537]  It's so vital that we reach those people.
[01:58:47.358 --> 01:58:49.099]  And tell everybody about the Internet.
[01:58:49.119 --> 01:58:49.960]  We're not going to stop.
[01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:51.341]  I am so fired up right now.
[01:58:52.121 --> 01:58:54.043]  Okay, where's the other huge mega-story?
[01:58:54.063 --> 01:58:56.024]  It's now up on presentplanet.com.
[01:58:56.465 --> 01:58:58.766]  Unsolicited advice to the government of Iran.
[01:58:59.087 --> 01:59:01.108]  This is from the Huffington Post.
[01:59:01.729 --> 01:59:03.610]  Now, it's all over the place.
[01:59:03.810 --> 01:59:06.893]  It's a letter that Gary Hart put out publicly to the government of Iran.
[01:59:07.708 --> 01:59:09.269]  And he says, basically, the U.S.
[01:59:09.309 --> 01:59:10.650]  government stages terror attacks.
[01:59:10.670 --> 01:59:12.171]  You better do exactly what we say.
[01:59:12.432 --> 01:59:14.213]  I mean, he just came right out and said it.
[01:59:15.033 --> 01:59:16.454]  There's no mincing words.
[01:59:16.615 --> 01:59:21.738]  It's just a five-year-old with half a brain would know this and understand this.
[01:59:21.758 --> 01:59:23.179]  This is off the charts huge.
[01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:31.645]  For a few stations that just carried the last hour, Saddam Hussein tried to take the offer to leave in exile.
[01:59:31.706 --> 01:59:34.988]  I even remember that they even offered him cash and he could take money with him.
[01:59:36.101 --> 01:59:36.721]  That's what he said.
[01:59:36.761 --> 01:59:37.462]  He said, OK.
[01:59:38.122 --> 01:59:46.226]  And then it came out in the news that they had F-15s waiting to shoot him down, and interceptors waiting as soon as he took off, and had the airports under surveillance.
[01:59:47.166 --> 01:59:58.312]  So, another lie to the public that he could have left, they could have taken over, and had everything, but see, there wouldn't have been an excuse to blow up the water treatment, the universities that they'd rebuilt, the power plants.
[01:59:59.112 --> 02:00:05.315]  And they had power 24 hours a day in Baghdad again, after a lot of determination, despite the sanctions and the genocide.
[02:00:06.144 --> 02:00:08.786]  I mean, the whole country was under siege.
[02:00:09.667 --> 02:00:10.848]  There's no excuses now.
[02:00:10.868 --> 02:00:15.252]  You tried to blame it on Saddam, it was all lies, and your little CIA op you betrayed.
[02:00:15.272 --> 02:00:18.114]  That's another sick thing, how they betrayed their own officer.
[02:00:19.055 --> 02:00:25.420]  I mean, it's just, after he waged war against the Persians, waged war against the other Arabs, did what he was told!
[02:00:26.942 --> 02:00:29.464]  But he wouldn't fully give the country over to their control.
[02:00:30.839 --> 02:00:37.021]  This is such a huge story and the Dig Barry Brigade is on Dig.com and Reddit and everywhere else burying it down right now.
[02:00:37.081 --> 02:00:39.162]  Why don't you go on there and rampage and dig it up?
[02:00:39.522 --> 02:00:40.902]  Why don't you get it out on MySpace?
[02:00:40.942 --> 02:00:43.383]  Why don't you help us get this truth out to everybody?
[02:00:44.623 --> 02:00:46.904]  The White House memo came out and didn't get a lot of attention.
[02:00:48.124 --> 02:00:56.467]  Official British papers came out, but it never made the nightly news here, that the White House knew that they weren't going to be able to attack
[02:00:57.156 --> 02:00:58.377]  They didn't think they had enough support.
[02:00:58.417 --> 02:01:00.058]  Turned out they went ahead and did it anyways.
[02:01:00.358 --> 02:01:02.820]  So they wanted to stage this shootdown on an American aircraft.
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:07.523]  This is Bush and Tony Blair, released by the British government, staging shootdowns.
[02:01:07.883 --> 02:01:11.505]  And it comes out that they had this meeting three months before 9-11.
[02:01:11.765 --> 02:01:15.128]  Excuse me, three months before the attack in 2003 in Iraq.
[02:01:19.295 --> 02:01:20.155]  It's not even this.
[02:01:20.295 --> 02:01:26.756]  Well, this new giant report Bush White House kept secret, Saddam Hussein tried to give up and leave Iraq.
[02:01:27.156 --> 02:01:27.776]  No!
[02:01:29.537 --> 02:01:32.057]  No, no, no, no!
[02:01:33.237 --> 02:01:39.899]  Because the PMAC documents and all of them told us, we're going in there to exterminate.
[02:01:40.719 --> 02:01:41.879]  We're gonna break it up.
[02:01:41.979 --> 02:01:45.880]  We're gonna bring them back to the horse and buggy and the camel and the goat.
[02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:48.540]  Parking lot, parking lot, ha ha ha.
[02:01:49.403 --> 02:01:52.844]  Well, I don't want any part of children dying of cholera and amoebic dysentery.
[02:01:53.144 --> 02:01:55.745]  I don't want any part of their little swollen bellies and them dying.
[02:01:55.965 --> 02:01:58.586]  Or people in rape camps being raped with battery acid.
[02:01:59.187 --> 02:02:00.807]  Yes, General Togumbo's report.
[02:02:01.267 --> 02:02:02.168]  The Army's own report.
[02:02:02.628 --> 02:02:06.729]  I don't want any part of John Hughes' public memos about torturing children sexually.
[02:02:07.410 --> 02:02:08.710]  The whole world knows about that!
[02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.731]  Then he defends it.
[02:02:10.731 --> 02:02:13.452]  The whole world knows about Gonzales saying Bush is God.
[02:02:13.652 --> 02:02:16.193]  The whole world thinks that's conservatism now!
[02:02:17.023 --> 02:02:20.066]  Meanwhile, the NRA set to pass the biggest gun bill ever.
[02:02:20.426 --> 02:02:21.847]  They authored the thing.
[02:02:22.828 --> 02:02:26.831]  Larry Pratt told you yesterday, but you won't listen.
[02:02:27.051 --> 02:02:29.814]  You want your guns to be turned in.
[02:02:30.975 --> 02:02:33.176]  You want to lose your guns.
[02:02:33.397 --> 02:02:34.538]  You're scum!
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:40.422]  I'm talking to you, you fake conservative trash, you pieces of filth!
[02:02:44.375 --> 02:02:45.096]  Terrorism!
[02:02:45.276 --> 02:02:46.037]  Terrorism!
[02:02:46.137 --> 02:02:52.225]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:02:52.465 --> 02:02:54.067]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:02:54.307 --> 02:02:56.790]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:02:57.171 --> 02:03:03.899]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne
[02:03:03.979 --> 02:03:04.879]  We're good to go.
[02:03:25.225 --> 02:03:30.628]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:03:30.729 --> 02:03:31.949]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:03:32.009 --> 02:03:32.350]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:03:46.878 --> 02:03:52.327]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:52.707 --> 02:04:00.299]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:01.027 --> 02:04:08.091]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:08.491 --> 02:04:19.897]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:20.217 --> 02:04:23.759]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:26.401]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:26.441 --> 02:04:30.283]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:44.085 --> 02:04:52.129]  Hi, this is Jeff Rentz, and if you're interested in suppressed natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[02:04:52.529 --> 02:05:01.813]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[02:05:02.193 --> 02:05:06.495]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[02:05:06.995 --> 02:05:19.086]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineral-like compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory, and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery, and arthritis.
[02:05:19.386 --> 02:05:24.330]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[02:05:24.710 --> 02:05:28.053]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound, and the best part?
[02:05:28.434 --> 02:05:29.935]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[02:05:30.015 --> 02:05:32.377]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[02:05:32.397 --> 02:05:34.359]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[02:05:34.739 --> 02:05:35.080]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:35.722]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[02:05:48.749 --> 02:05:52.932]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:05:53.572 --> 02:05:54.413]  You want answers?
[02:05:55.153 --> 02:05:56.034]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:56.715 --> 02:06:00.577]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.917 --> 02:06:05.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:12.888 --> 02:06:14.630]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[02:06:14.650 --> 02:06:16.451]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:16.471 --> 02:06:16.531]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:16.551 --> 02:06:20.475]  We've got a bunch of other news on the police state, on the economy I haven't even gotten to, and some audio clips.
[02:06:20.555 --> 02:06:21.996]  But right now we're going to your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:22.036 --> 02:06:24.058]  What do you think of this top story here?
[02:06:36.974 --> 02:06:45.301]  Saddam Hussein wanted to go, wanted to take the exile deal, because, you know, they couldn't just go in there and invade without that opportunity.
[02:06:45.321 --> 02:06:49.124]  They had to at least claim that they wanted to do that.
[02:06:50.225 --> 02:06:56.590]  But when he said, OK, I'm going to take the offer, they said, uh-uh, buddy.
[02:06:57.090 --> 02:07:02.675]  Again, they wanted to go in, have the war, have the black hole to dump trillions of dollars into their coffers in.
[02:07:03.613 --> 02:07:05.434]  It's a lawless area of pirating.
[02:07:05.894 --> 02:07:06.555]  That's what happened.
[02:07:06.595 --> 02:07:07.075]  Piracy.
[02:07:09.316 --> 02:07:10.117]  That's the reality.
[02:07:10.157 --> 02:07:15.339]  And then we have Gary Hart telling the Iranians in a letter, hey, there's going to be staged terror events if you play games.
[02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:18.301]  Our government creates provocations.
[02:07:18.341 --> 02:07:20.382]  He actually says that in a letter.
[02:07:20.462 --> 02:07:22.143]  Gary Hart, the big CFR chieftain.
[02:07:22.784 --> 02:07:25.985]  Alright, Tom, in Louisiana.
[02:07:26.045 --> 02:07:27.086]  You're on the air, Tom.
[02:07:27.126 --> 02:07:27.466]  Welcome.
[02:07:27.826 --> 02:07:28.547]  How you doing, sir?
[02:07:28.707 --> 02:07:28.927]  Good.
[02:07:30.591 --> 02:07:38.534]  First, I would advise your listeners to read the essay by Smedley Butler, All War is a Wreck-It.
[02:07:40.314 --> 02:07:45.996]  Number two thing that I'm going to say is you interviewed somebody last week, Walter Burien.
[02:07:46.016 --> 02:07:49.117]  Yeah, I'm going to have Walter back on, if not tomorrow, next week.
[02:07:49.697 --> 02:07:59.320]  That was a complicated issue that most people don't understand, but it was the comprehensive annual financial reports that
[02:08:00.163 --> 02:08:05.544]  Why don't you boil it down in your own words for people, and I'll give people my... It's a rip-off.
[02:08:07.185 --> 02:08:08.405]  It's a total rip-off.
[02:08:08.445 --> 02:08:12.366]  You can go to C-A-F-R-man.com.
[02:08:12.486 --> 02:08:13.786]  Cafferman.com.
[02:08:15.787 --> 02:08:22.408]  And you can click on your state and find out how big of a surplus they've been running.
[02:08:23.177 --> 02:08:24.438]  With your tax dollars?
[02:08:42.313 --> 02:08:44.955]  Two years ago, so we got to put toll roads on the existing roads.
[02:08:45.355 --> 02:08:46.596]  We don't have enough money.
[02:08:46.897 --> 02:08:48.558]  But let me just finish.
[02:08:48.918 --> 02:08:54.963]  Then their own document got released, and they had $6 billion per year in secret surplus.
[02:08:55.163 --> 02:08:56.304]  Take the University of Texas.
[02:08:56.604 --> 02:09:00.107]  Well over $40 billion in cream accounts, and they just raised tuition.
[02:09:00.127 --> 02:09:00.427]  Go ahead.
[02:09:00.767 --> 02:09:04.230]  Texas has $54 billion in surpluses.
[02:09:05.250 --> 02:09:07.152]  Sir, just the university has over $40 billion.
[02:09:09.219 --> 02:09:11.601]  No, I'm just looking at this one website.
[02:09:11.641 --> 02:09:13.061]  You know what this reminds me of?
[02:09:14.262 --> 02:09:34.573]  Is when I was in the service, the Air Force, they would spend all their money on golf courses, and barracks, and gyms, and chow halls, and then they'd say, we need some more money for our airplanes.
[02:09:35.793 --> 02:09:36.874]  It's the same kind of thing.
[02:09:39.833 --> 02:09:42.843]  Well, they treat the public like they're complete idiots because they are ill-informed.
[02:09:42.863 --> 02:09:43.385]  When you've got...
[02:09:47.605 --> 02:10:06.833]  24 million, 23 million, it goes up and down, barrels of oil being used today, and 15 million barrels 12 or so years ago, and you look at the official gross receipts of federal gas taxes, it's just off the chart big, and they go, we don't have enough money because of hybrid cars, and the public believes it.
[02:10:06.873 --> 02:10:09.874]  I mean, it's just... No, this whole thing is a huge scam.
[02:10:11.158 --> 02:10:14.300]  I know, it makes the mind boggled.
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:17.462]  Do you have any comments about Saddam wanting to give up and they wouldn't let him?
[02:10:18.943 --> 02:10:28.509]  Saddam back then, and you heard basically back then in 92 or 91, Saddam said, what do I do?
[02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:32.391]  And we had somebody say, go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[02:10:32.411 --> 02:10:33.472]  That was April Gillespie, yeah.
[02:10:33.732 --> 02:10:35.333]  Yeah, April Gillespie.
[02:10:36.834 --> 02:10:40.576]  That's what, I was actually in the service back then.
[02:10:42.731 --> 02:10:44.232]  And that's how it happened.
[02:10:44.732 --> 02:10:49.413]  I mean, they were like, it was pretty much back then a currency war.
[02:10:49.853 --> 02:10:50.554]  I didn't know it.
[02:10:51.754 --> 02:10:54.715]  But more and more, it's becoming a currency war.
[02:10:55.935 --> 02:10:56.696]  I hear you, Tom.
[02:10:56.736 --> 02:10:57.356]  Thanks for the call.
[02:10:57.376 --> 02:10:58.256]  I appreciate it.
[02:10:58.296 --> 02:10:59.076]  Who's up next here?
[02:11:01.057 --> 02:11:02.557]  Jeff in New Mexico, you're on the air.
[02:11:02.577 --> 02:11:02.998]  Go ahead.
[02:11:04.578 --> 02:11:08.419]  Yes, Alex, I have a couple things I disagree with you about.
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:10.340]  First of all, it's your
[02:11:11.005 --> 02:11:16.646]  implicit defense of Google by even mentioning it as a search engine.
[02:11:16.926 --> 02:11:22.848]  I think that Sergey Brin of Google is a dad-gum, avaricious immigrant.
[02:11:23.208 --> 02:11:24.948]  Boycott Google products.
[02:11:25.248 --> 02:11:25.688]  Oh, gosh.
[02:11:25.828 --> 02:11:26.148]  Okay.
[02:11:26.508 --> 02:11:26.868]  What else?
[02:11:27.468 --> 02:11:39.291]  And also, I don't think you want to stick up for assisted suicide rights because you want to distance yourself from, not be associated with,
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:50.116]  People that are being falsely accused of being not merely for suicide rights for themselves and others, but also possibly homicidal suicidal.
[02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:57.784]  Well, listen, you haven't called in about a year, Jeff, and I appreciate you calling, but every time you've been calling me for, what, eight, nine, ten years?
[02:11:58.364 --> 02:12:02.907]  Every time you call, I recognize your voice as soon as I heard it.
[02:12:02.927 --> 02:12:04.307]  It's been over a year since you've called.
[02:12:04.708 --> 02:12:10.991]  Every time you call, you boggle my mind, because I don't get the feeling that you dislike me, but I get the feeling that you don't understand me.
[02:12:12.172 --> 02:12:14.073]  I do not support assisted suicide.
[02:12:14.093 --> 02:12:15.233]  I do not support abortion.
[02:12:16.394 --> 02:12:17.615]  But you're saying that because
[02:12:18.615 --> 02:12:22.496]  Uh, uh, we euthanized my dog yesterday.
[02:12:22.556 --> 02:12:23.857]  I'm for euthanasia.
[02:12:24.697 --> 02:12:26.037]  No, no, not at all.
[02:12:26.718 --> 02:12:28.538]  Did I even say we euthanized my dog?
[02:12:29.298 --> 02:12:30.779]  Where did you even get that statement?
[02:12:31.779 --> 02:12:33.660]  What did I say that made you call in and say that?
[02:12:34.900 --> 02:12:42.002]  Well, um, I think you're distancing yourself because you don't want to be associated with people that
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:44.881]  Or for assisted suicide like myself.
[02:12:45.041 --> 02:12:46.182]  Oh, you're for it!
[02:12:46.242 --> 02:12:47.063]  You're for it!
[02:12:47.263 --> 02:12:47.843]  Oh, okay.
[02:12:48.063 --> 02:12:54.747]  Yeah, because I'm actually more courageous because the Homeland Security could say this guy might be homicidal, too.
[02:12:55.588 --> 02:12:56.948]  You know, they might... I appreciate you, Jeff.
[02:12:56.968 --> 02:12:58.009]  Jeff, it's always weird.
[02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:59.850]  Listen, I just don't have time.
[02:13:00.670 --> 02:13:02.331]  By the way, I know people disassociate.
[02:13:02.371 --> 02:13:04.593]  Like, they automatically see really hardcore issues.
[02:13:04.613 --> 02:13:07.474]  And when I'm really talking about something hardcore, the callers are all over the map.
[02:13:07.855 --> 02:13:08.935]  And I don't screen your calls.
[02:13:09.035 --> 02:13:10.076]  But, I mean, come on, man!
[02:13:11.572 --> 02:13:15.635]  One of the head policy makers for the New World Order, Gary Hart is high up, folks.
[02:13:15.655 --> 02:13:20.637]  I mean, he's at the upper tier of Minions and Gophers for the Rockefellers and Rothschilds.
[02:13:21.938 --> 02:13:23.979]  He's saying to Iran, hey, the U.S.
[02:13:23.999 --> 02:13:25.160]  stages terror attacks.
[02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:26.621]  We stage provocations.
[02:13:26.641 --> 02:13:27.401]  You better do what we say.
[02:13:27.581 --> 02:13:28.522]  I mean, he says it!
[02:13:28.762 --> 02:13:30.183]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:13:31.223 --> 02:13:34.545]  As of a little while ago, Watson didn't have it up there.
[02:13:34.585 --> 02:13:36.266]  Let's see, he's a hard-working guy, though.
[02:13:36.286 --> 02:13:36.866]  I can't grab it.
[02:13:36.886 --> 02:13:37.607]  Let's see if it's up now.
[02:13:38.297 --> 02:13:42.759]  He likes to do it in mass updates and have everything at once, but I know Steve's doing an article about it right now.
[02:13:42.819 --> 02:13:43.540]  It's so huge.
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:45.501]  And no one calls in about it.
[02:13:46.621 --> 02:13:53.465]  Or they admit that Saddam wanted to give up and the whole war was a fraud, even from Neocon's aim of getting Saddam out and bringing all this freedom.
[02:13:54.285 --> 02:14:01.268]  And, uh, what do you want to bet that, uh, that people aren't going to want to talk to me about that?
[02:14:01.328 --> 02:14:01.749]  Okay, good.
[02:14:01.789 --> 02:14:02.109]  It's up.
[02:14:03.129 --> 02:14:04.870]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Philly.
[02:14:04.910 --> 02:14:05.771]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:14:05.811 --> 02:14:06.151]  Go ahead.
[02:14:07.170 --> 02:14:07.810]  Mr. Jones.
[02:14:08.130 --> 02:14:08.250]  Hi.
[02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:09.671]  It's an honor and pleasure.
[02:14:10.151 --> 02:14:22.974]  As a first-time caller, I wanted to talk about, just real quick, one of the first things that got me into this whole movement, in some senses, was reading the Dune Novels by Frank Herbert.
[02:14:24.594 --> 02:14:30.896]  One of the ideas that he purports in this book, in his series of books, is that power doesn't necessarily corrupt.
[02:14:31.736 --> 02:14:34.317]  It's that positions of power attract corruptible people.
[02:14:35.274 --> 02:14:41.840]  And this kind of brought me to the idea of, you know, what would happen if we were drafting politicians in some way.
[02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:45.563]  You know, people that weren't lifelong politicians.
[02:14:45.703 --> 02:14:57.073]  And, you know, what you thought about this idea, you know... Well, you could do that, but... In some sense, I feel like Ron Paul was kind of drafted by a movement that...
[02:14:59.219 --> 02:15:06.726]  Yeah, he's 72, his wife's got heart problems, and believe me, he didn't want to run.
[02:15:06.766 --> 02:15:07.647]  I talked to him privately.
[02:15:07.767 --> 02:15:08.828]  I begged him to run.
[02:15:08.848 --> 02:15:12.432]  I'm not saying I made him run, but all of us together did.
[02:15:13.433 --> 02:15:17.476]  But then they would start manipulating the drafting process.
[02:15:17.576 --> 02:15:22.141]  You ever notice controllers always stand up and say, I'm the leader, everyone's under me now.
[02:15:22.967 --> 02:15:24.768]  You know, the people in the Patriot Movement do that.
[02:15:24.888 --> 02:15:26.068]  I'm the leader, do what I say.
[02:15:26.428 --> 02:15:28.369]  No, the leader says, let's all take action.
[02:15:28.389 --> 02:15:32.730]  See, parasites know how to get in control of the trough.
[02:15:32.770 --> 02:15:41.072]  And so, that's why the Founding Fathers split government up in three parts to fight with each other so that they would never get it over the people.
[02:15:41.292 --> 02:15:45.254]  It was pure genius when you really read and study what they did.
[02:15:49.469 --> 02:15:51.310]  I have to say though, I like the first Dune novel.
[02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:54.371]  He was just kind of making money after that.
[02:15:54.831 --> 02:15:57.252]  Yeah, I hear what you mean.
[02:15:57.272 --> 02:16:01.154]  But you like Dune Messiah and you like all those.
[02:16:01.854 --> 02:16:03.615]  To me, God Emperor is the one.
[02:16:03.795 --> 02:16:05.076]  But I know what you mean.
[02:16:05.196 --> 02:16:10.018]  They have their value, but I think he, in some ways, this idea of plans within plans.
[02:16:10.858 --> 02:16:11.858]  Wheels within wheels.
[02:16:12.579 --> 02:16:15.400]  Yeah, and earlier you were talking about... Yeah, they say wheels within wheels, yeah.
[02:16:16.112 --> 02:16:18.514]  Saddam, you know, this kind of...
[02:16:33.050 --> 02:16:36.932]  He was a reporter in Saudi Arabia, I hear, before he got into doing novels, I guess.
[02:16:37.192 --> 02:16:45.254]  Well, he was a reporter up in Idaho, into Oregon, and saw the desert moving in, also, to other areas.
[02:16:46.715 --> 02:16:52.197]  He really became a novice ecologist, and he was a real environmentalist.
[02:16:52.277 --> 02:16:56.558]  He understood that man made planets better, that we could actually terraform this one and make it better.
[02:16:57.448 --> 02:16:58.249]  He was a genius.
[02:16:58.289 --> 02:16:59.709]  There's no doubting Ted Herbert.
[02:16:59.829 --> 02:17:00.270]  I'm feeling it.
[02:17:00.550 --> 02:17:16.017]  The only other thing I wanted to say is I heard about your dog, and I wanted to say, any of your listeners out there, I don't know if you have done any research into this, but pretty much up in Philly, and you know, I don't know what it's like down there, but pretty much every dog owner I know up here has been giving their dog Frontline or something similar.
[02:17:18.510 --> 02:17:22.471]  No, I haven't.
[02:17:23.251 --> 02:17:26.593]  We just give them baths if they get fleas and we exterminate.
[02:17:26.713 --> 02:17:32.995]  So we just take care of the flea instead of letting fleas crawl all over us or mosquitoes.
[02:17:33.295 --> 02:17:34.475]  We kill the pest.
[02:17:35.316 --> 02:17:36.116]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[02:17:36.136 --> 02:17:36.716]  I appreciate it.
[02:17:36.756 --> 02:17:38.677]  Yeah, those drugs are what's killing a lot of them.

[02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:32.129]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.

[02:19:10.330 --> 02:19:18.595]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[02:19:18.615 --> 02:19:21.137]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[02:19:21.437 --> 02:19:25.218]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[02:19:25.418 --> 02:19:31.659]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[02:20:48.824 --> 02:20:53.708]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:20:53.928 --> 02:20:55.249]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:08.260]  Call me back again, my friend, when we get more time.
[02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:09.781]  I enjoyed the fine points you were making.
[02:22:09.801 --> 02:22:12.503]  Only to have me, the redneck, babble over you.

[02:22:21.928 --> 02:22:22.068]  Hi.
[02:22:24.471 --> 02:22:33.042]  You make a lot of good points and you educate people and use a lot of points of fact, but they seem disjointed and they seem like illogical.
[02:22:33.102 --> 02:22:33.983]  Why would this happen?
[02:22:34.744 --> 02:22:38.930]  I have some things to say that would make it all seem more logical.
[02:22:40.377 --> 02:22:42.558]  Well, I'm going to let you talk, but let me just say this.
[02:22:43.178 --> 02:22:46.840]  I report on what they're doing, and people say, well, why, why, why?
[02:22:47.060 --> 02:22:50.022]  Like I'd say, they stage 9-11, I'd give the evidence, they'd say, why?
[02:22:50.262 --> 02:22:55.404]  Well, now the neocons know everybody know, so they just come out and go, well, if we did it, we did it for your own good.
[02:22:55.424 --> 02:22:59.286]  I mean, they did it... I mean, we know why they do it.
[02:22:59.306 --> 02:23:02.908]  They want to knock out any sovereign nation so they can dominate everybody.
[02:23:03.208 --> 02:23:03.668]  But go ahead.
[02:23:04.605 --> 02:23:06.085]  Well, that's part of it.
[02:23:06.285 --> 02:23:11.466]  The other thing, we got used to having control of Iraqi oil during the 90s.
[02:23:11.927 --> 02:23:22.989]  Since the end of the first Gulf War, people in New York, at the UN, and the money from the sale of the oil went to banks in New York.
[02:23:23.789 --> 02:23:32.511]  And once Saddam had fulfilled the UN resolutions and destroyed his weapons, even right before
[02:23:34.005 --> 02:23:34.305]  I don't
[02:23:53.455 --> 02:24:05.799]  Exactly, it was a rotten, empty husk of poor, pathetic people, in many cases starving to death, and that was heaven compared to now, and these idiots who can't even find Iraq on a map, shoot their mouth off.
[02:24:06.279 --> 02:24:08.019]  I mean, this is so wicked, my friend.
[02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:20.403]  And these same idiots that shoot their mouths off and think that we're unpatriotic, when their pensions are gone, when this economy is ruined, when Social Security is no longer existent,
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:42.616]  They're going to go after the people who, and even innocent people, you know, these... Anyway, I think there is the basic thing is our government, our Senate, our Congress is controlled by Israel.
[02:24:42.736 --> 02:24:45.338]  They are agents of Israel, and that's according to
[02:24:46.755 --> 02:24:48.156]  A Knesset member wrote an article.
[02:24:48.636 --> 02:24:49.376]  It's ridiculous.
[02:24:49.396 --> 02:24:59.219]  Yeah, and also, the quasi-late last Israeli Prime Minister bragged about it in newspapers.
[02:24:59.559 --> 02:25:03.661]  And then, I'm not supposed to talk about them bragging how they control us?
[02:25:04.121 --> 02:25:07.022]  But let me be clear, a lot of that is hoot, sput, and arrogance.
[02:25:07.122 --> 02:25:09.382]  Israel is one of the dominant, not the dominant.
[02:25:09.963 --> 02:25:14.104]  Let's say this, on foreign military policy, that they are the dominant lobby.
[02:25:14.944 --> 02:25:17.625]  Because Israel gives more!
[02:25:17.645 --> 02:25:17.625]  54%!
[02:25:18.425 --> 02:25:22.846]  They've got the new Yale book out on it.
[02:25:23.846 --> 02:25:26.507]  54% of all federal campaign contributions.
[02:25:26.647 --> 02:25:33.289]  I mean, folks, we give them $4 billion a year in cash, and over a billion of it comes right back.
[02:25:34.589 --> 02:25:40.431]  Well, even if it's $4 million, as Perot and other techs in there claim,
[02:25:41.215 --> 02:25:41.775]  In the 80s.
[02:25:42.235 --> 02:25:42.976]  Four million?
[02:25:42.996 --> 02:25:43.616]  No, no, no, no, sir.
[02:25:43.756 --> 02:25:47.798]  I'm talking about just massive amounts of that four billion come back.
[02:25:48.758 --> 02:25:53.700]  No, no, there's no debate, and that's an official number that 54% of all federal giving is Israel.
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:54.660]  You didn't know that?
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:58.742]  No, of course I knew that.
[02:25:58.962 --> 02:25:59.762]  I'm not poo-pooing you.
[02:25:59.802 --> 02:26:01.663]  I'm saying that's a real number I just gave.
[02:26:02.083 --> 02:26:07.506]  No, I said four million comes to the Senate, which is a pittance compared to four billion.
[02:26:07.646 --> 02:26:08.606]  It's one one thousandth.
[02:26:09.269 --> 02:26:11.831]  Well, no, I mean, I'm talking the whole federal government.
[02:26:12.091 --> 02:26:13.832]  But that controls our government.
[02:26:14.413 --> 02:26:22.498]  That is enough, and that's a very good return on your money, to make a 100,000% return a year.
[02:26:23.279 --> 02:26:34.287]  So, that's a good investment, but I wanted to find neoconservatives, too, because this is a book, Dangerous Liaison, the inside story of the U.S.-Israeli covert relationship.
[02:26:36.109 --> 02:26:39.990]  That was pulled off the shelves of my library, and that's where I find some of this stuff.
[02:26:40.650 --> 02:26:43.671]  You know, when they glean the truth out of the library.
[02:26:45.611 --> 02:26:48.892]  Traditionally, it's like, here's an example.
[02:26:51.412 --> 02:26:57.094]  Polaritz was a prominent example of a group that became known as neoconservatives, the increasingly powerful.
[02:26:59.759 --> 02:27:01.100]  I'm reading backwards here.
[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:02.221]  We're almost out of time, bro.
[02:27:02.241 --> 02:27:03.741]  I've got a lot of other people in front of you.
[02:27:03.881 --> 02:27:04.522]  I understand.
[02:27:04.942 --> 02:27:07.083]  And listen, call back in with another point another day.
[02:27:07.143 --> 02:27:07.984]  Thank you for calling.
[02:27:08.264 --> 02:27:09.185]  Another great caller.
[02:27:09.205 --> 02:27:12.246]  I know you want to document what you're saying.
[02:27:12.286 --> 02:27:12.947]  Everybody knows.
[02:27:14.327 --> 02:27:18.770]  But again, it helps the New World Order, the ADL's own documents, other groups.
[02:27:18.850 --> 02:27:23.733]  When Jews get persecuted, it helps the controllers then control them.
[02:27:24.725 --> 02:27:30.129]  That's the key here, is that I'm not here to bash Jews, Catholics, Protestants, anybody.
[02:27:30.169 --> 02:27:31.229]  I'm here to bash evil people.
[02:27:31.570 --> 02:27:33.591]  And there's no doubt Israel is very wicked.
[02:27:34.431 --> 02:27:35.352]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.812 --> 02:27:37.413]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.334 --> 02:27:41.056]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.193 --> 02:27:49.676]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:50.116 --> 02:27:54.359]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:54.779 --> 02:28:01.623]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:02.083 --> 02:28:08.765]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:09.105 --> 02:28:10.705]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:28:11.005 --> 02:28:14.186]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:14.466 --> 02:28:16.927]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[02:28:31.174 --> 02:28:32.935]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[02:28:44.543 --> 02:28:46.464]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach!
[02:28:46.924 --> 02:28:47.184]  Look!
[02:28:47.604 --> 02:28:48.645]  Up there in the sky!

[02:28:50.385 --> 02:28:51.946]  He's in a dive!
[02:28:52.226 --> 02:28:54.227]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach!
[02:28:54.527 --> 02:28:55.287]  Let's go look!
[02:28:57.528 --> 02:29:00.709]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel!
[02:29:01.109 --> 02:29:02.450]  Stop patting them in the sand!
[02:29:02.670 --> 02:29:03.110]  Take them out!
[02:29:03.746 --> 02:29:04.427]  Let's see.
[02:29:04.447 --> 02:29:09.031]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[02:29:09.051 --> 02:29:09.852]  Don't worry.
[02:29:10.293 --> 02:29:11.814]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:29:12.455 --> 02:29:16.859]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[02:29:17.380 --> 02:29:19.462]  Oh, I will Non-X Man.
[02:29:19.582 --> 02:29:22.265]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[02:29:24.412 --> 02:29:27.054]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[02:29:27.535 --> 02:29:30.997]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.

[02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:53.780]  Think about it.
[02:30:54.301 --> 02:30:58.884]  Gary Hart comes right out and says, you know, our government stages the terror attacks.
[02:30:59.865 --> 02:31:04.728]  The big debate in history is, are wars done by provocation?
[02:31:04.748 --> 02:31:05.949]  Do we provoke them?
[02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:08.651]  You better do what we say.
[02:31:08.671 --> 02:31:09.892]  You better look at the Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:31:12.093 --> 02:31:12.674]  It's incredible.
[02:31:12.734 --> 02:31:13.835]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[02:31:13.975 --> 02:31:15.616]  All right, I'm going to race through.
[02:31:17.848 --> 02:31:23.190]  Daniel, Scott, Tom, Jason, and Dan's call because I want to get into Missouri Police Stakeout Brett Darrow.
[02:31:23.971 --> 02:31:26.952]  We first, about six months ago, he's the young man tired of checkpoints.
[02:31:26.992 --> 02:31:30.914]  He pulls up to huge checkpoints, major highway, searching everybody's car.
[02:31:30.954 --> 02:31:31.894]  They want to ask him questions.
[02:31:31.934 --> 02:31:32.434]  He goes, no.
[02:31:33.895 --> 02:31:37.717]  So they threaten him, but then a smarter, high-level cop comes over and says, let him go.
[02:31:38.377 --> 02:31:39.297]  Fine, whatever.
[02:31:39.337 --> 02:31:40.078]  He videotapes it.
[02:31:40.458 --> 02:31:43.159]  Then they, then he starts doing it more.
[02:31:43.399 --> 02:31:44.500]  They pull him over.
[02:31:44.620 --> 02:31:45.500]  He's in a parking lot.
[02:31:47.196 --> 02:31:48.937]  The transit parking lot where you go get on the buses.
[02:31:49.357 --> 02:31:51.398]  Cop comes over within 30 seconds and says, what are you doing?
[02:31:51.418 --> 02:31:52.258]  He says, I'm just sitting here.
[02:31:52.618 --> 02:31:53.599]  Well, I want to ask you questions.
[02:31:53.619 --> 02:31:54.659]  I don't have to answer your questions.
[02:31:54.839 --> 02:31:55.680]  He's being nice about it.
[02:31:55.960 --> 02:31:59.621]  Cop goes, I'll frame you right now with resisting me or other crimes.
[02:31:59.901 --> 02:32:03.403]  By the end of it, he says, all right, we're going to go ahead and... The guy's groveling by then.
[02:32:03.423 --> 02:32:04.723]  He goes, nah, I'm going to show you a lesson.
[02:32:04.743 --> 02:32:06.604]  We're going to go ahead and get you for resisting and everything else.
[02:32:07.244 --> 02:32:09.685]  That video now is all over newspapers everywhere.
[02:32:09.705 --> 02:32:12.646]  Now the cops are shaking out his house, harassing him.
[02:32:13.327 --> 02:32:16.188]  Two weeks ago, they went on the big cop website and said we ought to kill him.
[02:32:18.181 --> 02:32:19.722]  I mean, this is getting crazy!
[02:32:20.723 --> 02:32:21.923]  So I'm going to try to play some of that.
[02:32:22.443 --> 02:32:26.266]  Right now, let's go ahead and go... I've got to move quick, folks, so I don't get to everybody.
[02:32:27.126 --> 02:32:28.867]  To Daniel in New York, you're on the air.
[02:32:28.887 --> 02:32:30.528]  Hi, Alex.
[02:32:30.968 --> 02:32:31.108]  Hi.
[02:32:31.188 --> 02:32:34.230]  I'm from Underground World News at Yahoo!
[02:32:34.270 --> 02:32:34.550]  Groups.
[02:32:35.831 --> 02:32:45.696]  On the 25th, I was listening to the program, and I believe you gave your opinion about who was causing the world affairs, and you said it was Christian Zionists.
[02:32:47.362 --> 02:32:48.343]  No, that's not what I said.
[02:32:48.363 --> 02:32:49.365]  That is not what I said.
[02:32:49.385 --> 02:32:50.426]  Okay.
[02:32:50.667 --> 02:32:55.133]  What I said was, is what types would they use to plant the bombs?
[02:32:55.985 --> 02:33:12.968]  Okay, I said evil dual war sociopaths above that, but I said if I had to say a group who believe they were doing it for America, who believe they were doing it for Israel, biblically, to fight the evil Arabs, who don't know our government funds the Arabs, that it would be a Christian Zionist type they would use to do that.
[02:33:13.268 --> 02:33:14.928]  Just like things are taken out of context.
[02:33:15.108 --> 02:33:19.869]  I said that Arabs now own the majority stock in the world stock markets.
[02:33:20.129 --> 02:33:23.050]  That's the Financial Times of London, that's Axable shareholders,
[02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:26.773]  And then I said they're now buying up Hollywood and control many studios.
[02:33:27.273 --> 02:33:33.998]  It was then misrepresented that I was, people emailed me going, well you're saying the Arabs own all of Hollywood.
[02:33:34.018 --> 02:33:37.781]  No, I'm saying they are beginning, yes, some studios they do now control.
[02:33:38.262 --> 02:33:38.622]  Okay?
[02:33:39.062 --> 02:33:43.846]  I'm not, not saying that, you know, it wasn't started by Jews, this obsession with Jews.
[02:33:44.366 --> 02:33:51.612]  So my point is, it was in major newspapers today, not only is Halliburton moving to Dubai,
[02:33:53.007 --> 02:33:53.988]  That's by Saudi Arabia.
[02:33:54.648 --> 02:33:54.828]  Right.
[02:33:55.689 --> 02:34:04.795]  Now they're going to build a three, one article says 2.5, one says three, multi-billion dollar biggest movie stage in the world.
[02:34:04.875 --> 02:34:06.597]  Okay, so they're moving to Dubai now.
[02:34:07.177 --> 02:34:09.218]  I mean, that's because they own a bunch of it.
[02:34:09.839 --> 02:34:11.480]  I don't know how to explain this to people.
[02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:12.000]  Go ahead.
[02:34:13.141 --> 02:34:20.246]  Also, my second point was, I don't know if you ever heard of the theory that Prince Charles is the Antichrist.
[02:34:20.406 --> 02:34:21.327]  He actually,
[02:34:23.334 --> 02:34:28.800]  Out of 42 of the prophecies, he actually fulfills 27 of the prophecies of the Antichrist.
[02:34:29.201 --> 02:34:31.143]  I can't get people to read official U.S.
[02:34:31.183 --> 02:34:35.007]  government documents planning to carry out 9-11, so I'm certainly not going to get into prophecies.
[02:34:35.047 --> 02:34:38.071]  I'll leave that to people that want to do that and say that's their purview.
[02:34:38.131 --> 02:34:39.072]  Most of it's quackery.
[02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:45.291]  I know some good people that have done research on the New World Order and real data, and they say that about him.
[02:34:45.811 --> 02:34:46.251]  I don't know.
[02:34:46.391 --> 02:34:52.473]  I know that in Brazil they have a giant gold statue with people worshipping him, calling him God.
[02:34:52.533 --> 02:34:54.913]  They call his father God in New Guinea.
[02:34:55.473 --> 02:34:56.434]  They think they're God.
[02:34:56.494 --> 02:34:57.454]  They're New Agers.
[02:34:57.714 --> 02:34:58.134]  Whatever.
[02:34:58.194 --> 02:34:59.054]  I appreciate your call.
[02:34:59.354 --> 02:34:59.834]  Oh, I forgot.
[02:34:59.854 --> 02:35:01.995]  Somebody disagrees, and I forgot to go to them first.
[02:35:02.575 --> 02:35:04.615]  Daniel, Scott, Tom, Jason.
[02:35:05.076 --> 02:35:05.696]  Is it Dan?
[02:35:06.236 --> 02:35:06.976]  Who disagrees here?
[02:35:07.748 --> 02:35:08.568]  Okay, we've got to move quick.
[02:35:08.608 --> 02:35:09.629]  Dan in Kentucky, go ahead.
[02:35:09.649 --> 02:35:14.571]  I disagree that Jeff's call was just weird.
[02:35:14.852 --> 02:35:17.113]  I think it was psychotic.
[02:35:17.373 --> 02:35:24.777]  And, you know, other people that are against us in this movement that are psychotic, such as Troy, who you can call at 304-755.
[02:35:24.917 --> 02:35:27.078]  Okay, thanks for the call, sir.
[02:35:27.098 --> 02:35:31.620]  I mean, it's just unbelievable, folks.
[02:35:32.361 --> 02:35:35.983]  I mean, come on, I know you disassociate, and I've seen this over the years.
[02:35:36.583 --> 02:35:39.584]  When we get into really hardcore stuff, it just goes nuts.
[02:35:40.825 --> 02:35:50.369]  And people, A, bring up religion as their salve, their psychological salve, and I mean fake religion, not spiritually being strong and sound.
[02:35:51.391 --> 02:36:07.056]  Because if God's in you, and the Spirit of the Lord's in you, you're going to want to fight evil, and talk about that, and helping, and saving people, and getting the word out, instead of just arguing all day about secularism, and sections, and which group you're part of, and all of this, and this guy's of this, and this guy's of that.
[02:36:07.296 --> 02:36:09.537]  We've been trained how to fight with each other and ninny.
[02:36:11.277 --> 02:36:15.018]  When big news comes out, and serious stuff's going on, it's the message boards all go to chatter.
[02:36:15.399 --> 02:36:17.159]  The only thing is the government most of the time.
[02:36:17.219 --> 02:36:18.159]  It's just ninnying.
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:19.800]  Stop ninnying.
[02:36:21.236 --> 02:36:24.299]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Arizona.
[02:36:24.319 --> 02:36:25.060]  Scott, you're on the air.
[02:36:25.721 --> 02:36:26.842]  Hey Alex, man.
[02:36:26.862 --> 02:36:28.463]  It's time to call it to you.
[02:36:28.483 --> 02:36:29.644]  Welcome.
[02:36:29.784 --> 02:36:30.725]  Big fan of yours, man.
[02:36:32.607 --> 02:36:34.669]  I'm out here trying to get the word out here in Arizona.
[02:36:34.709 --> 02:36:37.051]  I mean, we got that border problem out here like Texas.
[02:36:38.332 --> 02:36:40.615]  We just had a cop shot by an illegal alien.
[02:36:40.635 --> 02:36:42.376]  That would be the third one this year.
[02:36:42.396 --> 02:36:44.178]  But that's kept real quiet, though.
[02:36:45.073 --> 02:36:47.756]  All the big TB clinics all over the Southwest.
[02:36:48.056 --> 02:36:49.277]  Tens of thousands in them.
[02:36:50.078 --> 02:36:51.139]  All the kids.
[02:36:51.219 --> 02:36:53.601]  Some schools are getting 200 plus cases a year.
[02:36:53.981 --> 02:36:55.522]  It's all kept real quiet.
[02:36:56.363 --> 02:36:57.064]  Oh, I know they are.
[02:36:57.104 --> 02:36:57.964]  They're trying to keep it quiet.
[02:36:57.984 --> 02:37:02.488]  But the people on the talk radio and they're trying to get this.
[02:37:02.528 --> 02:37:03.990]  They're talking about it and they're raged at it.
[02:37:04.010 --> 02:37:11.456]  But one thing I'm trying to get out is I've talked to the conservative caucus and they're trying to get it out on this North American Union.
[02:37:12.057 --> 02:37:16.119]  And that they have, they've got all the materials on it, and they're trying to get the word out.
[02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:19.481]  So there are people inside Washington, D.C.
[02:37:19.521 --> 02:37:22.503]  because they're from Washington, D.C., the conservative caucus out there.
[02:37:22.803 --> 02:37:24.304]  They even got videos on the North.
[02:37:24.324 --> 02:37:26.825]  No, no, I mean, I've interviewed Howard Phillips.
[02:37:26.845 --> 02:37:28.146]  Oh, okay.
[02:37:28.446 --> 02:37:31.748]  I put Howard Phillips' TV show on ten years ago when it started.
[02:37:32.889 --> 02:37:34.830]  Oh, okay, great, because that's the guy that's doing it.
[02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:37.431]  And, uh, you know, I'm trying to help them.
[02:37:37.451 --> 02:37:38.452]  I mean, since they are,
[02:37:38.857 --> 02:37:46.118]  You know, the media and stuff, it'll take them kind of serious as far as, like, serious... No, exactly.
[02:37:46.639 --> 02:37:47.779]  He's got good credentials.
[02:37:47.939 --> 02:37:49.999]  Big winner of the Republican Party 20 years ago when he left.
[02:37:50.579 --> 02:37:52.200]  Over there, the fact they're not conservative.
[02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:53.460]  I appreciate your call.
[02:37:54.140 --> 02:37:55.800]  Yeah, we've got to get focused here.
[02:37:55.860 --> 02:37:58.701]  And look, we're waking up the mainline conservatives now.
[02:37:59.461 --> 02:38:04.422]  You want to do a big article about Larry Pratt on his material, proving the NRA is the father of gun control.
[02:38:05.618 --> 02:38:07.362]  But you tell somebody that they can't believe it.
[02:38:07.382 --> 02:38:08.745]  You have to read it in their own words.
[02:38:11.431 --> 02:38:13.135]  How do you think they're going to get our guns?
[02:38:14.887 --> 02:38:17.649]  But they have the liberal fake media attack them.
[02:38:18.089 --> 02:38:19.090]  It's a dog and pony show.
[02:38:19.130 --> 02:38:20.071]  It's good cop, bad cop.
[02:38:20.511 --> 02:38:29.018]  And then the liberal media plays the part of the bad cop and you run to the arms of the NRA and as soon as you hug them they take a big dagger and just ram it right in your back while they smile.
[02:38:29.378 --> 02:38:36.884]  And then you feel the dagger going into you and you giggle and snicker and kiss the NRA on your back and he says, oh that dagger, that's the liberal stabbing you.
[02:38:36.904 --> 02:38:37.804]  Don't look back though.
[02:38:38.185 --> 02:38:39.826]  Don't mind my arm plunging it.
[02:38:40.638 --> 02:38:41.919]  And I'm going, he's stabbing you!
[02:38:41.979 --> 02:38:42.099]  Look!
[02:38:42.119 --> 02:38:43.700]  And you're like, shut up, liberal!
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:45.100]  Oh, I love you!
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:46.501]  Oh, baby!
[02:38:47.161 --> 02:38:53.944]  You can't go look at how they set up the 68 Gun Control Act, or the Brady Bill, or the Veterans Disarmament Act right now.
[02:38:54.465 --> 02:38:55.965]  They're the ones sponsoring it!
[02:38:56.226 --> 02:39:01.568]  But you can't look at it, because you serve that drug addict Rush Limbaugh.
[02:39:01.968 --> 02:39:07.451]  You serve that piece of trash Sean Hannity, who says arrest all militias and every child should have a chip.
[02:39:07.991 --> 02:39:09.593]  You serve the weakness!
[02:39:09.833 --> 02:39:11.014]  You serve defeat!
[02:39:11.234 --> 02:39:12.535]  You serve lies!
[02:39:12.775 --> 02:39:14.437]  You are not a constitutionalist!
[02:39:14.597 --> 02:39:15.978]  You are not a conservative!
[02:39:16.118 --> 02:39:17.179]  You are trash!
[02:39:17.359 --> 02:39:18.420]  Weak-minded filth!
[02:39:20.822 --> 02:39:21.823]  Oh, I'm sick of you!
[02:39:21.843 --> 02:39:23.805]  Just knock the telephone off.
[02:39:25.134 --> 02:39:26.335]  It's gonna be beeping in a minute.
[02:39:27.456 --> 02:39:33.161]  I just want to... And they're all just fake and soft little fathead fake conservatives.
[02:39:33.381 --> 02:39:34.362]  You're fatheads!
[02:39:34.982 --> 02:39:36.764]  And let me tell all the liberals something.
[02:39:36.784 --> 02:39:39.767]  I know you and you are gonna love it when Hillary's in.
[02:39:39.827 --> 02:39:41.368]  Just a reign of evil!
[02:39:41.388 --> 02:39:44.511]  Alright, I gotta stop.
[02:39:44.551 --> 02:39:45.111]  I gotta stop.
[02:39:45.151 --> 02:39:46.793]  I'm just getting sick and tired of it.
[02:39:47.733 --> 02:39:50.796]  We could defeat these people if you'd stop being so willfully ignorant!
[02:39:52.088 --> 02:39:53.829]  And just check out what I'm saying!
[02:39:54.049 --> 02:39:54.990]  For the country's sake!
[02:39:55.010 --> 02:39:56.130]  For your children's sake!
[02:40:00.352 --> 02:40:02.193]  Oh, man.
[02:40:03.374 --> 02:40:05.675]  Look, if you're not mad about what's happening, there's something wrong with you.
[02:40:07.736 --> 02:40:09.377]  Tom, in New Jersey.
[02:40:09.397 --> 02:40:09.897]  Go ahead.
[02:40:10.718 --> 02:40:11.778]  Uh, buddy, are you okay?
[02:40:11.878 --> 02:40:13.059]  Yeah, I'm fired up!
[02:40:13.079 --> 02:40:14.180]  All right, man.
[02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:15.200]  Listen, I love you.
[02:40:15.340 --> 02:40:15.760]  You're great.
[02:40:16.081 --> 02:40:17.842]  I thank you for taking the red pill, brother.
[02:40:18.302 --> 02:40:19.442]  I took it a long time ago.
[02:40:19.462 --> 02:40:19.943]  Me too.
[02:40:20.083 --> 02:40:20.403]  Me too.
[02:40:21.281 --> 02:40:22.262]  I have a quick question.
[02:40:22.362 --> 02:40:25.745]  Marvin Bush was a head of security in the Trade Center.
[02:40:25.845 --> 02:40:26.526]  Was he not?
[02:40:26.666 --> 02:40:29.929]  Yes, he was the head of the company that ran the security there.
[02:40:30.429 --> 02:40:33.111]  And we know that because of the memoirs of Mommy.
[02:40:34.973 --> 02:40:36.594]  Mommy wrote it in her own book.
[02:40:38.216 --> 02:40:38.736]  Incredible.
[02:40:39.457 --> 02:40:41.198]  And you don't really hear much about that.
[02:40:41.558 --> 02:40:45.622]  I haven't really heard it, even with all the talk about the Trade Centers for the last five years.
[02:40:45.642 --> 02:40:47.243]  They're also the head of security at Boston Logan.
[02:40:49.887 --> 02:40:50.329]  Oh, was he?
[02:40:50.590 --> 02:40:51.974]  Oh my goodness.
[02:40:52.797 --> 02:40:54.342]  How much more obvious does it get?
[02:40:55.023 --> 02:40:56.283]  It's sickening, bro.
[02:40:56.323 --> 02:40:58.264]  It's sickening, and I just think you're doing a great job.
[02:40:58.284 --> 02:40:59.905]  And that's why the audience is screaming, folks!
[02:40:59.945 --> 02:41:02.206]  We got hardcore killers!
[02:41:02.406 --> 02:41:04.246]  You think I like being way out here on front?
[02:41:04.386 --> 02:41:05.387]  But you gotta do it!
[02:41:06.027 --> 02:41:06.947]  You gotta fight them!
[02:41:06.987 --> 02:41:08.408]  You can't just get into them!
[02:41:08.828 --> 02:41:09.728]  I give you credit, bro.
[02:41:09.768 --> 02:41:11.089]  That's why I get mad, man!
[02:41:11.129 --> 02:41:12.809]  These people don't play games!
[02:41:13.189 --> 02:41:14.610]  Well, you know, it really annoyed me.
[02:41:14.670 --> 02:41:19.972]  I woke up and I realized there's no five-point check for the immigrants in New York to get a driver's license now.
[02:41:20.532 --> 02:41:21.652]  But you have to get through it!
[02:41:21.672 --> 02:41:23.713]  Yeah, how do you think that makes the federal citizen feel?
[02:41:25.106 --> 02:41:25.886]  Well, hey, we saw it.
[02:41:25.906 --> 02:41:26.787]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, bro.
[02:41:27.067 --> 02:41:31.850]  In 93, they put thumb scanners in in Texas, and people on the street would tell me they didn't put a thumb scanner in.
[02:41:31.890 --> 02:41:32.950]  I'd go, do you remember the red light?
[02:41:33.210 --> 02:41:35.011]  They'd go, oh, yeah, duh, duh, duh.
[02:41:35.291 --> 02:41:49.058]  And then I, and then LeVar Smith, the fake conservative from San Antonio, the congressman, was in the news going, now, the immigrants don't have to do this because, uh, they said it was for the immigrants originally, and then they said, oh, they don't, they don't have to have proof when they get one.
[02:41:49.859 --> 02:41:50.119]  Wow.
[02:41:51.011 --> 02:42:00.694]  And now AP reported New York immigrants don't have to have a check, but there's a war on terror and cops will pull you and I over and demand to search our car!
[02:42:01.094 --> 02:42:01.955]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[02:42:02.495 --> 02:42:08.417]  I was out two weeks ago and they had a checkpoint for seatbelts in New Jersey.
[02:42:08.737 --> 02:42:10.217]  Which is an excuse to search the car.
[02:42:10.537 --> 02:42:12.678]  It was incredible how many people were pulled over.
[02:42:13.018 --> 02:42:16.119]  I was amazed at how many police officers were doing it.
[02:42:16.839 --> 02:42:18.500]  It's all about swarming us.
[02:42:19.304 --> 02:42:19.965]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:20.405 --> 02:42:21.407]  It made no sense to me.
[02:42:21.427 --> 02:42:24.610]  I want all the cops to know you're cutting your own throat when you do that.
[02:42:24.750 --> 02:42:26.733]  You're bringing in the commissars when you do it.
[02:42:27.454 --> 02:42:29.356]  Yeah, it's a sad thing.
[02:42:29.416 --> 02:42:30.617]  And I also want to thank you.
[02:42:30.637 --> 02:42:35.983]  I advertise on your show twice a day for the next 30 days, and I've been getting countless calls.
[02:42:36.043 --> 02:42:37.325]  I'm not going to plug my website.
[02:42:37.445 --> 02:42:37.906]  No, go ahead.
[02:42:37.946 --> 02:42:38.366]  Who is this?
[02:42:38.426 --> 02:42:38.987]  I'm curious.
[02:42:39.685 --> 02:42:42.188]  Oh, this is, okay, uh, hempusa.org.
[02:42:42.688 --> 02:42:43.529]  Oh, yeah, I've been hearing a lot.
[02:42:43.569 --> 02:42:45.491]  In fact, I want to hit you up to advertise my website.
[02:42:45.512 --> 02:42:46.913]  I believe in hemp products.
[02:42:46.953 --> 02:42:48.695]  They're a lot better than cotton and everything else.
[02:42:48.875 --> 02:42:55.162]  Well, it's been overwhelming, the calls I've gotten, and... Well, listen, listen, I mean, I mean, listen, I mean, the show is sold out.
[02:42:55.282 --> 02:42:56.744]  Of course, the network's the one who's hit my promise.
[02:42:56.764 --> 02:42:58.125]  I was the last one to buy into your show.
[02:42:58.285 --> 02:42:58.626]  That's right.
[02:42:58.986 --> 02:43:04.571]  Yeah, and they get the profits because Ted has a lot of expenses, but maybe you can sponsor the website because our expenses are getting so high.
[02:43:04.951 --> 02:43:07.413]  But yeah, that's why every other Patriot show piles on here.
[02:43:07.613 --> 02:43:13.038]  That's why they all... And then the thing is, a lot of the other Patriot shows detest me, and I have to carry them all on my back.
[02:43:13.258 --> 02:43:16.821]  But this show is bigger than the entire Patriot radio movement together.
[02:43:16.861 --> 02:43:17.702]  That's official numbers.
[02:43:17.982 --> 02:43:19.323]  And that doesn't make me feel arrogant.
[02:43:19.363 --> 02:43:20.164]  That scares me.
[02:43:20.914 --> 02:43:24.297]  I'd like to send you, I want to send you some, because I've got to tell you something.
[02:43:24.317 --> 02:43:25.217]  This is between me and you.
[02:43:25.237 --> 02:43:28.820]  I believe that when you start on this product, I'm going to send you some for free.
[02:43:40.535 --> 02:43:44.219]  I guarantee you one thing, within 30 days, you will slim down.
[02:43:44.719 --> 02:43:45.019]  I hear you.
[02:43:45.039 --> 02:43:46.621]  I've already lost some weight because I'm on the interview.
[02:43:46.801 --> 02:43:51.045]  Listen, I appreciate your call, and get his info for me.
[02:43:51.386 --> 02:43:52.427]  But let me just stop right there.
[02:43:52.447 --> 02:43:55.069]  I got Jason and others, but I've got to get to this clip now.
[02:43:55.109 --> 02:43:56.971]  We'll take your calls in the final segment here.
[02:43:58.585 --> 02:44:00.587]  Uh, this is what's making the big deal.
[02:44:00.967 --> 02:44:01.948]  The cop pulls him over.
[02:44:02.008 --> 02:44:02.929]  He's in a parking lot.
[02:44:03.149 --> 02:44:04.510]  He just says, look, I don't have to answer your questions.
[02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:06.792]  The cop blows up at him and says, I can frame you.
[02:44:07.192 --> 02:44:12.936]  And now the cop's been fired, but now other cops are saying he should be killed on cop websites and then getting in trouble.
[02:44:13.277 --> 02:44:14.618]  The cops are parked at his house.
[02:44:14.638 --> 02:44:15.939]  There's video of that out today.
[02:44:16.219 --> 02:44:17.400]  Now it's hitting newspapers.
[02:44:17.660 --> 02:44:23.425]  This is a young 19-year-old guy in Missouri, and this is what's happening to him.
[02:44:23.665 --> 02:44:24.786]  He had the video in his car.
[02:44:24.826 --> 02:44:25.186]  Here it is.
[02:44:25.967 --> 02:44:26.567]  How we doing?
[02:44:26.987 --> 02:44:27.428]  What's going on?
[02:44:28.171 --> 02:44:28.511]  Something.
[02:44:28.531 --> 02:44:29.411]  Why aren't you parking here?
[02:44:29.871 --> 02:44:30.372]  Can't I park here?
[02:44:30.412 --> 02:44:31.372]  It's a commuter lot, right?
[02:44:31.392 --> 02:44:33.092]  Yeah, yeah, but we have found that you like that.
[02:44:33.112 --> 02:44:33.392]  Okay.
[02:44:33.412 --> 02:44:34.173]  We're bringing cars.
[02:44:34.213 --> 02:44:35.413]  Do you have any ID on you?
[02:44:35.753 --> 02:44:36.333]  Uh, yeah, I do.
[02:44:36.653 --> 02:44:37.374]  Seriously.
[02:44:37.414 --> 02:44:38.134]  Did I do something wrong?
[02:44:38.154 --> 02:44:39.474]  You're a suspicious vehicle right now.
[02:44:39.494 --> 02:44:39.954]  I'm what?
[02:44:40.434 --> 02:44:42.515]  You are a suspicious vehicle right now.
[02:44:42.535 --> 02:44:43.495]  In a commuter parking lot?
[02:44:43.515 --> 02:44:44.156]  Yeah, you are.
[02:44:44.176 --> 02:44:45.656]  Because we have car fees in here.
[02:44:45.956 --> 02:44:46.596]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:44:46.616 --> 02:44:47.416]  I can park right here.
[02:44:47.476 --> 02:44:49.197]  You want me, you want to come out of the car?
[02:44:49.217 --> 02:44:49.537]  Come on.
[02:44:49.577 --> 02:44:49.777]  Come on.
[02:44:57.183 --> 02:44:59.205]  You want to try me?
[02:44:59.245 --> 02:45:01.446]  You want to try me tonight?
[02:45:01.486 --> 02:45:03.928]  You think you have a bad night?
[02:45:04.309 --> 02:45:06.430]  I'm going to ruin your night.
[02:45:06.750 --> 02:45:07.631]  You want to try me?
[02:45:08.312 --> 02:45:09.993]  Do you want to try me, young boy?
[02:45:11.134 --> 02:45:13.516]  You want to try me tonight, young boy?
[02:45:14.116 --> 02:45:17.559]  You want to go to jail for some stupid reason I come up with?
[02:45:18.159 --> 02:45:19.620]  You want to see who knows the law better?
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:20.481]  Me or you?
[02:45:21.301 --> 02:45:23.163]  My experience compared to your young a**?
[02:45:24.244 --> 02:45:24.484]  Huh?
[02:45:26.072 --> 02:45:29.133]  If you ever get smart mouth with a cop again, I'll show you what a cop does.
[02:45:29.433 --> 02:45:30.693]  Do you want to scam me?
[02:45:31.114 --> 02:45:31.934]  Try and talk back.
[02:45:32.094 --> 02:45:33.174]  Talk back to me again.
[02:45:33.454 --> 02:45:35.995]  Maybe I can say you resisted arrest or something.
[02:45:36.015 --> 02:45:36.995]  You want to come up with something?
[02:45:37.296 --> 02:45:38.316]  I come up with nine things.
[02:45:38.596 --> 02:45:39.776]  Do you want to try something?
[02:45:39.896 --> 02:45:40.857]  Right here.
[02:45:40.877 --> 02:45:42.777]  I'm going to give you a ticket for that.
[02:45:42.857 --> 02:45:44.538]  You want me to come up with some more?
[02:45:44.578 --> 02:45:47.539]  When you turn again, you tell me you're a different person.
[02:45:47.559 --> 02:45:48.859]  Do you want to try me some more?
[02:45:55.254 --> 02:45:55.495]  Huh?
[02:45:55.655 --> 02:45:55.975]  Come on.
[02:45:55.995 --> 02:45:57.978]  Give me an attitude a little bit more.
[02:45:58.138 --> 02:46:00.941]  I bet you, I guarantee I close this car by the time I'm done.
[02:46:01.302 --> 02:46:02.804]  You want to try me now?
[02:46:02.824 --> 02:46:04.626]  Give me a little bit more lift.
[02:46:04.666 --> 02:46:05.828]  Come on, boy!
[02:46:06.208 --> 02:46:06.949]  Come on, boy!
[02:46:06.989 --> 02:46:08.151]  Give me some more lift!
[02:46:08.411 --> 02:46:08.952]  You're done?
[02:46:10.396 --> 02:46:11.397]  You're about ready to get it.
[02:46:11.457 --> 02:46:13.418]  You already started your f***ing problem with your attitude.
[02:46:13.638 --> 02:46:15.160]  You think I'm a bad night boy?
[02:46:15.500 --> 02:46:15.780]  Huh?
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:16.781]  Answer me.
[02:46:17.061 --> 02:46:22.325]  I'll lock you up and probably with a police officer's command.
[02:46:22.365 --> 02:46:22.685]  Yeah.
[02:46:22.945 --> 02:46:23.265]  Yeah.
[02:46:23.846 --> 02:46:24.106]  Yeah.
[02:46:24.166 --> 02:46:25.667]  You want me to show you?
[02:46:25.847 --> 02:46:28.189]  You want me to lock you up and show you that I'm right and you're wrong?
[02:46:28.369 --> 02:46:28.950]  No, I don't.
[02:46:28.970 --> 02:46:30.971]  You want me to show you the f***ing ball?
[02:46:30.991 --> 02:46:31.031]  No.
[02:46:31.051 --> 02:46:31.331]  I know.
[02:46:31.391 --> 02:46:31.772]  I know.
[02:46:31.792 --> 02:46:32.112]  I saw it.
[02:46:32.132 --> 02:46:32.832]  Johnny Sorkin.
[02:46:32.912 --> 02:46:33.513]  Saw who?
[02:46:33.613 --> 02:46:34.213]  You my buddy?
[02:46:34.253 --> 02:46:35.014]  My best friend?
[02:46:35.134 --> 02:46:35.554]  Yeah.
[02:46:35.654 --> 02:46:37.096]  Okay, he's my best friend.
[02:46:37.136 --> 02:46:37.556]  Oh, good.
[02:46:38.056 --> 02:46:44.158]  When you go call him something, you can't even turn off the camera light and see what he says.
[02:46:44.178 --> 02:46:46.459]  If you got lucky, he'll walk away from you.
[02:46:46.499 --> 02:46:48.239]  I don't think he'll walk away.
[02:46:48.279 --> 02:46:50.800]  What are you doing with the camera on your car, dude?
[02:46:50.860 --> 02:46:51.400]  I got my car.
[02:46:51.481 --> 02:46:52.061]  Why is that?
[02:46:52.081 --> 02:46:52.881]  I made it up for him.
[02:46:54.392 --> 02:46:54.692]  Okay.
[02:46:54.712 --> 02:46:57.674]  I got one of my cars.
[02:46:58.034 --> 02:46:59.895]  And it goes on and on for another 10 minutes.
[02:47:00.436 --> 02:47:01.837]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[02:47:01.877 --> 02:47:06.299]  But the point is that he's going to visit his friend that works there at the bus terminal.
[02:47:06.319 --> 02:47:09.281]  And this guy is not, I'm getting him on the show, he's not even looking for it.
[02:47:09.581 --> 02:47:11.803]  He comes up to huge checkpoints with cops everywhere.
[02:47:12.063 --> 02:47:14.064]  That's how it all started like six, eight months ago.
[02:47:14.224 --> 02:47:14.864]  He's written about it.
[02:47:15.305 --> 02:47:18.046]  He got tired of just random checkpoints and pulling him out of the car.
[02:47:18.347 --> 02:47:19.547]  So he put the camera in the car.
[02:47:20.608 --> 02:47:21.288]  Cops threatening.
[02:47:21.368 --> 02:47:22.249]  That was the first video.
[02:47:23.035 --> 02:47:24.156]  Then this cop pulls him over.
[02:47:24.196 --> 02:47:25.236]  He turns the camera on.
[02:47:26.617 --> 02:47:27.677]  And now they're at his house.
[02:47:27.717 --> 02:47:28.898]  Now they're threatening to kill him.
[02:47:28.938 --> 02:47:30.119]  This cop's been fired.
[02:47:30.719 --> 02:47:32.760]  And notice he said, I'm going to show you who's right.
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:33.580]  Come on, boy.
[02:47:33.621 --> 02:47:34.241]  Come on, boy.
[02:47:34.521 --> 02:47:39.383]  I mean, I would be embarrassed starting a fight with a guy who was smaller than I was just on the street.
[02:47:39.944 --> 02:47:40.844]  I would feel shameful.
[02:47:42.345 --> 02:47:44.206]  I'd feel shameful starting a fight with somebody bigger than me.
[02:47:45.649 --> 02:47:50.471]  But a man does it like, it's like embarrassing to use your power over somebody.
[02:47:50.771 --> 02:47:53.072]  It'd be embarrassing to use your power over a woman.
[02:47:54.552 --> 02:47:55.712]  But see, not weak people.
[02:47:56.893 --> 02:47:57.933]  That guy was feeding.
[02:47:58.433 --> 02:48:01.474]  I got video of New York cops punching people and hitting them going, come on, fight me back!
[02:48:01.854 --> 02:48:03.815]  Hitting them in the face, pushing them.
[02:48:05.035 --> 02:48:05.756]  This is Missouri.
[02:48:06.416 --> 02:48:06.836]  Missouri.
[02:48:09.097 --> 02:48:09.797]  That's what they do.
[02:48:11.685 --> 02:48:13.206]  And, uh, he's just sitting there yelling at me.
[02:48:13.226 --> 02:48:13.926]  He goes on and on.
[02:48:13.966 --> 02:48:14.867]  Come on, say something back.
[02:48:14.907 --> 02:48:17.008]  And then, oh, don't talk or I'll arrest you.
[02:48:17.028 --> 02:48:18.808]  And then, oh, you better answer my question.
[02:48:18.828 --> 02:48:22.390]  It's the law to follow the order of a police officer to see no Fifth Amendment.
[02:48:23.430 --> 02:48:25.692]  And he goes on and on, the cop getting off on it.
[02:48:26.472 --> 02:48:33.975]  I mean, officer, you're going to feel tough when you follow rites of passage as a man.
[02:48:34.315 --> 02:48:38.097]  And let me tell you, a warrior and a man doesn't act like that.
[02:48:38.117 --> 02:48:39.558]  Okay?
[02:48:40.436 --> 02:48:42.717]  You don't pick on little skinny 19-year-olds.
[02:48:47.260 --> 02:48:52.723]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:53.104 --> 02:49:00.708]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:01.420 --> 02:49:08.485]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:08.865 --> 02:49:20.273]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.614 --> 02:49:24.276]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:24.576 --> 02:49:26.818]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:26.858 --> 02:49:30.621]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:50.101 --> 02:50:57.967]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Border, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues too.
[02:50:58.427 --> 02:51:03.751]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts,
[02:51:04.503 --> 02:51:10.525]  Now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:51:10.605 --> 02:51:11.105]  Central.
[02:51:11.485 --> 02:51:17.847]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated but never duplicated.
[02:51:18.547 --> 02:51:24.889]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:51:25.409 --> 02:51:30.511]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[02:51:31.251 --> 02:51:33.732]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story.
[02:51:34.446 --> 02:51:36.768]  But the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[02:51:37.128 --> 02:51:38.549]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[02:51:38.609 --> 02:51:40.691]  Central with The Divided Kingdoms.
[02:52:00.877 --> 02:52:02.297]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:02.317 --> 02:52:04.219]  I'll try to jam in a call or two at the end.
[02:52:04.299 --> 02:52:08.761]  Steve Watson's already whipped up a powerful article about the chilling statements of Gary Hart.
[02:52:09.182 --> 02:52:12.864]  It's up on Infowars.net and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:52:13.524 --> 02:52:13.845]  Get it.
[02:52:14.525 --> 02:52:15.386]  Get it out there.
[02:52:15.406 --> 02:52:16.787]  It's absolutely key.
[02:52:17.787 --> 02:52:23.691]  If you've missed any of the second hour because of internet outages, if you're an internet listener, we're going to replay the second hour.
[02:52:24.531 --> 02:52:36.261]  First and second hour with key information on the Saddam situation, how he tried to give up, and a lot more on Gary Hart in the first and second hour coming up here in a few minutes when the show restreams at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:36.281 --> 02:52:40.684]  The streams are up there for you right now at the InfoWars.com streams, not the Genesis streams.
[02:52:45.208 --> 02:52:46.909]  Shellocene is shellacite.
[02:52:46.929 --> 02:52:53.995]  It's out of the mountains of Tibet, and it is an alluvial deposit of minerals in ionic form with the carrier.
[02:52:55.217 --> 02:52:55.757]  We're good to go.
[02:53:23.488 --> 02:53:28.391]  That's blacklistedherb.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:53:28.891 --> 02:53:34.115]  And then there is another great group of folks, and that's InnerFood, the green food I take every day.
[02:53:34.955 --> 02:53:36.976]  And my office is all gobbling with abandon.
[02:53:37.077 --> 02:53:40.239]  Unless it tastes passable, not horrible like other green food.
[02:53:40.259 --> 02:53:43.881]  It tastes good, though, in orange juice or apple juice, and it's 20 great ingredients.
[02:53:44.201 --> 02:53:52.146]  Balanced energy all day long, greater stamina, weight loss, 20 power-packed ingredients, greater mental clarity, reduced food cravings, healthy, radiant skin, helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels.
[02:53:52.646 --> 02:53:56.647]  Healthy blood sugar, improved liver function, improved digestion, detoxing effects.

[02:54:02.909 --> 02:54:10.070]  InnerFood, E-N-E-R-Food.com or 866-762-9238 and call them and tell them Alex says you can get the discount too.
[02:54:10.090 --> 02:54:10.170]  866-762-92381.
[02:54:10.190 --> 02:54:11.171]  Thank that great sponsor, InnerFood.
[02:54:17.902 --> 02:54:20.263]  I can cram in calls, but will it do justice to you?
[02:54:20.303 --> 02:54:20.823]  We'll try.
[02:54:21.343 --> 02:54:23.464]  Rob in... well, no, Rob's... I'll try to get Rob in.
[02:54:23.484 --> 02:54:25.325]  Actually, it's Jason in Ohio first, then Rob.
[02:54:25.465 --> 02:54:26.185]  Jason, go ahead.
[02:54:27.145 --> 02:54:27.685]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:28.105 --> 02:54:28.606]  How you doing?
[02:54:28.686 --> 02:54:29.066]  Good, sir.
[02:54:29.566 --> 02:54:31.587]  Hey, I just wanted to say two quick things.
[02:54:31.647 --> 02:54:37.789]  Number one, David Ray Griffin spoke two nights ago here in Columbus, Ohio, and 150 people showed up for it.
[02:54:38.349 --> 02:54:43.851]  So the movement is growing here, even in the Midwest, and I just wanted to give a shout-out to Columbus 9-11 Truth for that.
[02:54:44.551 --> 02:54:47.272]  And secondly, just connected to that is,
[02:54:48.182 --> 02:55:07.909]  I talked to a lot of people in the truth movement who aren't really, they're still blinded by the left-right paradigm, and I just want to remind people, you know, this election is about the best non-establishment candidate, whoever that might be, and Ron Paul is really the only one who's got a... Exactly, they're saying Kucinich is good when he's for total gun bans.
[02:55:08.129 --> 02:55:10.350]  He is for gun bans, okay?
[02:55:10.370 --> 02:55:12.511]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robin Wyoming.
[02:55:12.531 --> 02:55:13.631]  You take us out, tail gunner.
[02:55:13.651 --> 02:55:15.332]  Hey, Alex, glad to be with you.
[02:55:16.138 --> 02:55:16.518]  Hello.
[02:55:16.878 --> 02:55:19.860]  I want to talk about the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:20.220]  SCAM.
[02:55:20.681 --> 02:55:21.201]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:55:21.381 --> 02:55:21.741]  Quickly.
[02:55:22.041 --> 02:55:22.322]  Okay.
[02:55:22.982 --> 02:55:25.683]  I got Wyoming's 2002 CAFRA report.
[02:55:26.204 --> 02:55:29.666]  In it, it reports that we had $4.8 billion.
[02:55:29.706 --> 02:55:31.427]  This is a little product, Wyoming.
[02:55:31.627 --> 02:55:36.149]  Five times the amount of the so-called budget surplus of $1 billion that they were touting.
[02:55:36.429 --> 02:55:37.590]  They didn't say a word about it.
[02:55:38.070 --> 02:55:40.392]  And that's because of Wyoming constitutional amendment.
[02:55:40.672 --> 02:55:41.852]  I don't have the exact number here.
[02:55:41.893 --> 02:55:42.473]  I'll get it later.
[02:55:43.153 --> 02:55:52.037]  It says that any monies, any revenue that goes into the Wyoming retirement system is for the extended families of government workers for all eternity.
[02:55:52.097 --> 02:55:53.697]  It can never be returned to the state.
[02:55:54.298 --> 02:56:05.042]  That's how they get... And so they're engaging, there's lots of laws like that across the fruited plain, so they're running massive felony scams everywhere, but they got guys that don't know who will do anything they say with machine guns.
[02:56:05.922 --> 02:56:06.762]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:56:06.782 --> 02:56:07.543]  Tell me more about that.
[02:56:07.563 --> 02:56:08.243]  That's exciting.
[02:56:08.703 --> 02:56:12.184]  Yeah, that's why you should all go investigate the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports.
[02:56:12.544 --> 02:56:17.505]  They actually carry a video that I made in 2000 with Walter Berrien on that subject at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:17.725 --> 02:56:21.446]  Alright, if you missed the second hour, it's about to restart at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:21.486 --> 02:56:22.266]  God bless you all!
[02:56:24.226 --> 02:56:28.107]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[02:56:28.467 --> 02:56:29.247]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
