[00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:06.223]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.883 --> 00:00:07.944]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.644 --> 00:00:09.764]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:11.245]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:12.886]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:17.207]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:21.849]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:29.712]  The big event is coming up tonight here in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:31.273]  It's absolutely free.
[00:00:32.396 --> 00:00:54.627]  On this first day of February 2007, put on by the Project for a New American Citizen student group, and George Humphries is going to speak first for about 30 minutes, then talk show host Jack Blood, and then of course myself for about an hour, and then we're going to, all three of us, get up there and take about 30-45 minutes of questions.
[00:00:54.667 --> 00:01:00.329]  It's going to go from 7.30 to a little bit past 10, and it's going to be extremely informative.
[00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:01.290]  We'll all be speaking on
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:15.026]  Basically, issues of the War on Terror, the War on Freedom, 9-11 being an inside job, the latest developments, the upcoming planned attack on Iran, how to hopefully avert that, and a lot more concerning our society and what's happening with humankind.
[00:01:15.046 --> 00:01:27.652]  That is coming up at the UT Union Ballroom, beautiful stately ballroom right underneath the UT Tower, and that is coming up this evening from 730 to a little bit past 10.
[00:01:27.692 --> 00:01:30.474]  We've got it until 1030, but we'll break it up by about 1015.
[00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:33.880]  So that is coming up tonight.
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.703]  Details and maps up on InfoWars.com.
[00:01:36.743 --> 00:01:43.949]  If you even live up in Dallas or San Antonio when you get off work, jump in the car and come on down.
[00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.772]  Folks from all over Central Texas, we'd really love to see you there as well.
[00:01:48.113 --> 00:01:57.341]  All the great students down at UT and of course my fellow Austinites, Pflugervillians, Round Rockians, Taylorans, and
[00:01:58.746 --> 00:01:59.566]  Just many others.
[00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:01.307]  You are, again, invited.
[00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:03.907]  Love to see you there coming up this evening.
[00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:08.469]  All right, we have Daniel Obechaike coming on the show.
[00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:23.733]  He's the Londoner who was on the bus that exploded on 7-7, a little bit over an hour after the trains exploded, and he witnessed all these black-op operatives directing the bus there and waiting when it exploded once it got there.
[00:02:23.773 --> 00:02:26.594]  The only major bus diverted, the only bus diverted there,
[00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:30.348]  That is coming up in the second hour.
[00:02:30.428 --> 00:02:37.973]  We gave you shades of this yesterday with Steve Watson, actually two days ago, joining us from London.
[00:02:38.614 --> 00:02:45.178]  Very important breaking news and Steve will be on with Daniel as well, coming up in the second hour.
[00:02:45.518 --> 00:02:55.324]  Then we have Wayne Madsen, former NSA operator, coming on to discuss the anti-war rally in DC over the weekend that was taken over by 9-11 Truth.
[00:02:55.344 --> 00:02:55.424]  Also,
[00:02:58.575 --> 00:03:05.717]  9-11 Truth and Patriot videos are dominating the Google Top 100 right now.
[00:03:05.797 --> 00:03:11.698]  Terror Storm was, what was it, like number 11 and number 74 last night.
[00:03:12.138 --> 00:03:17.199]  There's 50-something versions that I've seen of people that have uploaded it, which kind of keeps us out of the Top 100.
[00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:24.781]  But C'est La Vie, because they only count each one in its rankings, and you've got 50-something different, probably more now, uploads of it.
[00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:26.441]  Different people are watching different versions.
[00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:36.441]  You know, there'll be 600,000 here, 300,000 that have watched this one, 300,000 that have watched that one, 100,000 that have watched this one, 50,000 that have watched that one, 400,000 that have watched this one.
[00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:40.362]  But two TerrorStorm uploads are in the top 100.
[00:03:41.162 --> 00:03:46.063]  And America Freedom to Fascism went to number two late last night.
[00:03:46.103 --> 00:03:48.103]  When we wrote an article about it, it was at number three.
[00:03:48.683 --> 00:03:56.865]  And of course, you know what was numero uno, Loose Change Second Edition has been floating around in the top 100 for the last six months.
[00:03:58.482 --> 00:04:09.007]  But it's as if Google took the brakes off, because Google has admitted that at least twice they erased our page views on all of the TerrorStorm versions.
[00:04:09.367 --> 00:04:14.509]  Every time we'd go into the top 50, the top 100, racing towards number one, they would just erase all of our views.
[00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.730]  And they said, oh, it's an accident.
[00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.230]  Oh, we just keep doing it.
[00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.251]  We know they did it twice.
[00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:22.633]  We were told about it beforehand, but by the time we were watching it, we saw it happen twice.
[00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:24.413]  They admitted in an email they'd done it.
[00:04:24.754 --> 00:04:26.374]  So we know that it's more than twice.
[00:04:26.434 --> 00:04:27.755]  We can confirm twice.
[00:04:29.622 --> 00:04:32.503]  Why suddenly are they all not being held back?
[00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:36.124]  We know Loose Change 2nd Edition also had its numbers erased around the same time.
[00:04:37.305 --> 00:04:38.265]  Other videos didn't though.
[00:04:38.905 --> 00:04:43.107]  It was some beautiful woman speaking in a sultry voice.
[00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:48.755]  Playing ping-pong, it would stay in the top 100, but not anti-New World Order videos.
[00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:51.016]  Alright, masses of news straight ahead.
[00:04:51.036 --> 00:04:53.097]  Huge show lined up for you today.
[00:04:53.317 --> 00:04:55.478]  We'll tell you all about it and jump into it.
[00:04:55.778 --> 00:04:59.900]  On the other side, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.260]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.318 --> 00:05:09.783]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:17.770]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.487 --> 00:05:25.551]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:37.357]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.677 --> 00:05:41.119]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.601]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:47.743]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.081 --> 00:06:01.862]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.002 --> 00:06:02.762]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:08.926]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:09.186 --> 00:06:10.767]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:11.027 --> 00:06:13.509]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:28.458]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.478 --> 00:06:28.818]  government.
[00:06:28.978 --> 00:06:30.779]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:37.060]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.681]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:47.562]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:07:00.578 --> 00:07:02.964]  Attention, attention everyone!
[00:07:03.044 --> 00:07:05.510]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:09.661]  It's called EASE, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[00:07:10.322 --> 00:07:17.128]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:30.541]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:34.965]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[00:07:35.425 --> 00:07:45.508]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[00:07:45.888 --> 00:07:48.888]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:50.529]  That's Wristease.
[00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:55.890]  W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E Wristease.com.
[00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.571]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:06.870]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:20.355]  You will hear one of the survivors of the London bombings talking about government operatives all over the scene of the attack, directing the bus there out of hundreds of buses.
[00:08:21.576 --> 00:08:25.878]  Once it got there, operatives all around the bus, it explodes, they then put on fake bandages.
[00:08:26.875 --> 00:08:37.422]  Yes, this is absolute bombshell, smoking gun, and Daniel Obitake will be joining us from London, England in the second hour.
[00:08:37.482 --> 00:08:48.830]  We do have Wayne Madsen, former NSA officer, joining us to break down 9-11 Truth, the latest developments and how they took over the staged anti-war rally that was in D.C.
[00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.850]  over the weekend.
[00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:54.954]  We'll also have open phones on this live Thursday edition.
[00:08:56.886 --> 00:09:20.588]  But first, there has been a new development concerning John Yoo, who was one of the Chief White House Counsel's top lawyers, one of the top lawyers for President Bush, writing the supporting torture memorandum that was given to the guards, the Marine Corps guards and CIA
[00:09:22.091 --> 00:09:39.903]  Interrogators, torturers at places like Camp X-Ray and of course the Army and private technician tortures at Abu Ghraib and other camps around the world including over two dozen in Eastern and Central Europe in the former Soviet Union.
[00:09:41.022 --> 00:09:50.670]  Two of his memos written by him have been declassified as of two years ago, as well as three torture memos written by Alberto Gonzales.
[00:09:51.170 --> 00:10:04.681]  Of course, Alberto Gonzales, who then became Attorney General, wrote that the President was literally the law, not above the law, but the law, and that he had the power of a sovereign king.
[00:10:05.182 --> 00:10:06.483]  We've read these memos on air.
[00:10:06.503 --> 00:10:07.724]  They're in my film, Terror Storm.
[00:10:08.943 --> 00:10:16.390]  And that they could torture someone until they died, and if they didn't kill you on purpose, it was okay.
[00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:22.235]  They could stop breathing, organ failure, everything, as long as they didn't mean to kill you.
[00:10:22.915 --> 00:10:28.720]  So everything up until death, and if they kill you on accident, you can just say it's an accident, then it's okay.
[00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:33.384]  And we know it's included things I can't even mention on air.
[00:10:34.497 --> 00:10:38.281]  But it is in the official Army report.
[00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:39.202]  Just go read it.
[00:10:39.342 --> 00:10:40.783]  MSNBC has a copy of it.
[00:10:41.504 --> 00:10:45.568]  We have a copy of it, but you won't believe it if it's on PrisonPlanet.com or Infowars.com.
[00:10:45.588 --> 00:10:46.148]  Just go read it.
[00:10:47.149 --> 00:10:48.951]  They're on MSNBC's website.
[00:10:49.371 --> 00:10:59.401]  It's also on the National Archives website, where they talk about children being raped, women being raped, when they talk about them being raped in front of their mothers and fathers.
[00:11:00.405 --> 00:11:03.687]  Uh... and again this is because the sickos that run the government like to do this.
[00:11:04.108 --> 00:11:06.129]  This was just indiscriminate at Abu Ghraib.
[00:11:06.529 --> 00:11:10.172]  At Camp X-Ray, it concerns satanic rituals.
[00:11:11.056 --> 00:11:24.664]  Uh, and blood, uh, prostitutes flown in, uh, and I'm just going to leave it at that, with blood, uh, in Arabic saying satanic chants to completely terrify them while smearing them with blood.
[00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.445]  Again, that's mainstream news.
[00:11:27.006 --> 00:11:33.549]  So, raping children, blood, uh, sex, uh, just, just, I mean, you cannot get more sick.
[00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.091]  This is as sick as it gets.
[00:11:37.401 --> 00:11:55.835]  And I guess not to be overdone by Alberto Gonzalez, his deputy, his chief deputy, John Eube, wrote that small children could have their genitals crushed by pliers, by vice grips.
[00:11:57.116 --> 00:12:01.380]  And last year we interviewed Professor Kessel, who is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations,
[00:12:02.271 --> 00:12:16.680]  And we've played the audio tape here where they bring this up to them at a closed-door, secret Council on Foreign Relations meeting in Chicago, at the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations branch, the second-largest meeting branch in the country.
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:21.523]  The main headquarters, obviously, is in New York, and we've been there and protested them there.
[00:12:22.343 --> 00:12:28.127]  And when Johnny brings it up, you hear kind of a hiss and a small boo, because they're so upset with him.
[00:12:29.412 --> 00:12:34.355]  And then the Professor Castle, you know, says, do you believe the President has the power to order this?
[00:12:34.395 --> 00:12:35.295]  And he said, yes, I do.
[00:12:36.556 --> 00:12:38.797]  So, and, you know, did you write that?
[00:12:38.837 --> 00:12:40.078]  Did you say he has the power?
[00:12:40.098 --> 00:12:42.919]  And John, you said, well, yes, he does have that power.
[00:12:42.979 --> 00:12:51.423]  So chanting satanic slogans, blood being used and, you know, bathing them in it.
[00:12:52.204 --> 00:12:54.325]  Can you imagine what these people think of us?
[00:12:55.529 --> 00:12:58.931]  I mean, blood and raping and children.
[00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:00.552]  I mean, this is just off the charts!
[00:13:00.993 --> 00:13:03.074]  This is like Saw 3 or something.
[00:13:03.114 --> 00:13:10.579]  This is like some horrible, you know, horror movie made by Quentin Tarantino, I guess, like hostile.
[00:13:10.599 --> 00:13:12.441]  I haven't seen it, but I've read the synopsis of it.
[00:13:14.402 --> 00:13:16.503]  But it's our government doing it.
[00:13:17.544 --> 00:13:18.705]  And why do I bring this up?
[00:13:18.745 --> 00:13:20.406]  There has been a new development.
[00:13:22.017 --> 00:13:30.141]  There has been a new development video of torture master John Yoo being asked to justify crushing children's testicles comments.
[00:13:30.421 --> 00:13:35.643]  This is up on Infowars.net with the video shot by one of our listeners.
[00:13:35.723 --> 00:13:37.404]  We are very professionally done.
[00:13:37.884 --> 00:13:39.065]  We thank you for doing this.
[00:13:39.445 --> 00:13:42.746]  Please send us the raw video so we can put it in the film.
[00:13:43.207 --> 00:13:47.769]  Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
[00:13:49.249 --> 00:13:50.690]  Because, frankly,
[00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:56.994]  I didn't want to announce this, but in a few months we are going to have a second edition of Terror Storm.
[00:13:57.394 --> 00:13:58.535]  John Yoo is already in it.
[00:13:58.655 --> 00:14:03.677]  I'd like to have video, not just audio, and news articles about it with him admitting it.
[00:14:05.318 --> 00:14:06.899]  So, I know my staff is listening.
[00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:12.122]  If that listener is not tuned in and doesn't send it to me, get a hold of him and please get me that video.
[00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:18.765]  But you can see the video right now in internet quality up on InfoWars.net.
[00:14:18.805 --> 00:14:19.766]  It's pretty darn good there.
[00:14:20.646 --> 00:14:23.728]  And for the film, I'd like to have the original digital copy.
[00:14:24.609 --> 00:14:29.012]  Video of torture master John Yoo being asked to justify crushing children's testicles comments.
[00:14:29.652 --> 00:14:42.201]  The Baker Institute Student Forum hosted a discussion involving three panelists on November 3rd, 2006, one of which was John Yoo, co-author of the Patriot Act, and various controversial memos.
[00:14:42.261 --> 00:14:43.722]  And I guess this was in Houston.
[00:14:44.803 --> 00:14:48.586]  And we've actually had this listener call in, now I remember that,
[00:14:49.558 --> 00:14:51.619]  Well, let's find out where it came from and get it.
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.161]  I believe he did shoot it.
[00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:12.710]  Again, I'm just brainstorming here on air.
[00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.291]  This is kind of behind-the-scenes stuff I just do on air because I'm so busy.
[00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:16.892]  I just give orders on air.
[00:15:17.772 --> 00:15:34.040]  The Baker Institute Student Forum hosted a discussion involving three panelists on November 3rd, 2006, one of which was John Yoo, co-author of the Patriot Act and various controversial memos in which he advocated the possibility, the possible legality of torture and that enemy combatants could be denied protection under the Geneva Convention.
[00:15:35.981 --> 00:15:41.463]  Decreed that it was legal to declare war anywhere, anytime, on anyone the President deemed a threat, including U.S.
[00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:42.303]  citizens, I would add.
[00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:57.307]  At 1 hour, 39 minutes, 43 seconds into the 2 hour, 4 minute videotape, Yu was asked by an Infowarrior reader to explain the moral justification for cresting a child's testicles or raping a child in front of the parents.
[00:15:58.448 --> 00:16:03.529]  Yu backtracks on previous comments he made during the December 1st debate in Chicago with Notre Dame
[00:16:04.838 --> 00:16:09.920]  Professor and International Human Rights Scholar, because that was the year before, Doug Castle.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:18.023]  John, you gave the green light for people of torture to legally include sexual torture of infants.
[00:16:18.924 --> 00:16:21.785]  And then we've got the comments on the audio clip of Castle.
[00:16:22.165 --> 00:16:25.807]  But here's the audio from the new video with him.
[00:16:25.987 --> 00:16:29.708]  First they bring up Gulf of Tonkin staged events, and then he brings up the torture.
[00:16:29.748 --> 00:16:30.108]  Here it is.
[00:16:33.487 --> 00:16:38.234]  I just want to thank you gentlemen for coming out today.
[00:16:38.535 --> 00:16:48.410]  My dad was in camp, and for one, I think that there's sort of something here under the surface that's not really being discussed, and I think we still need to sort of
[00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.171]  We're good to go.
[00:17:12.623 --> 00:17:14.345]  We're good to go.
[00:17:35.825 --> 00:17:36.566]  We're good to go.
[00:17:55.002 --> 00:17:59.746]  I'm not saying that we should do any of those things.
[00:17:59.786 --> 00:18:02.468]  But you did in Chicago say that the President orders that.
[00:18:02.889 --> 00:18:04.029]  Jordan, I didn't.
[00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.011]  You said yes.
[00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:12.816]  Can I say what I say or do you want to leave everything you read on the internet?
[00:18:13.036 --> 00:18:14.297]  Hit pause and back that up.
[00:18:14.758 --> 00:18:22.564]  One of the esteemed professors slash lawyer panelists, they announced themselves, it was an hour and forty something minutes before this,
[00:18:23.483 --> 00:18:25.565]  Both the other lawyers are attacking him over this.
[00:18:26.045 --> 00:18:26.986]  And so they're informed.
[00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:29.568]  And then John Yoo says, do you believe everything you see on the Internet?
[00:18:30.188 --> 00:18:31.950]  This came out in mainstream newspapers.
[00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:40.716]  This was a surreptitiously recorded by Professor Castle, who was on the panel in Chicago the year before, confronting him.
[00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:41.977]  But what does Yoo do?
[00:18:42.057 --> 00:18:42.918]  He lies!
[00:18:43.639 --> 00:18:46.541]  He says, oh, do you believe everything you see on the Internet?
[00:18:47.722 --> 00:18:50.063]  I mean, we can play the clip of him again right now!
[00:18:50.344 --> 00:18:51.164]  We've played it like 20 times!
[00:18:55.313 --> 00:18:59.034]  Well, you know what, we'll play the rest of it when we get back from break, but back it up about 20 seconds.
[00:18:59.854 --> 00:19:03.714]  So you can hear him, by the other two panelists, start going, wait a minute, you did say that!
[00:19:03.734 --> 00:19:06.395]  I mean, they're not going to put up with him!
[00:19:07.535 --> 00:19:08.855]  He wrote memos!
[00:19:09.655 --> 00:19:10.716]  Signed by him!
[00:19:11.216 --> 00:19:13.096]  Implemented his White House policy!
[00:19:14.136 --> 00:19:15.617]  You know how we got these memos?
[00:19:16.477 --> 00:19:23.918]  They had hearings, what, almost a year ago about this, and Alberto Gonzalez had to testify, and he entered these into public evidence!
[00:19:25.512 --> 00:19:28.113]  The Attorney General is proud of these!
[00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:37.358]  This has been given to the operators of the overseas camps in Europe, in the Middle East, in Central Asia, and in the Caribbean.
[00:19:39.379 --> 00:19:39.719]  Cuba!
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.682]  I mean, look, you said it, you did it, you wrote it, you freak!
[00:19:46.123 --> 00:19:48.404]  And so you're gonna be exposed, you freak!
[00:19:49.385 --> 00:19:50.125]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.891 --> 00:20:04.452]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:20:04.492 --> 00:20:04.992]  are located?
[00:20:05.212 --> 00:20:08.593]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:21:01.423 --> 00:21:03.485]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:21:04.106 --> 00:21:13.036]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:21:13.477 --> 00:21:20.685]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?

[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.181]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[00:22:01.222 --> 00:22:01.943]  January 31st, 2007.
[00:22:02.003 --> 00:22:02.243]  Gold 652.
[00:22:02.323 --> 00:22:05.748]  Ounce gold coins are 673.20, 339.15 for half, 169.58 for quarter ounce coins at 673.20, 339.15 and 169.58.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.261]  1971, Nissan closes the gold window.
[00:22:17.321 --> 00:22:22.742]  Fiat currency, 1920s, the German mark explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[00:22:23.062 --> 00:22:24.903]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[00:22:24.923 --> 00:22:28.804]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[00:22:28.824 --> 00:22:31.625]  1998, gold jumps 2 thirds over the Russian ruble.
[00:22:32.285 --> 00:22:35.806]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[00:22:35.826 --> 00:22:40.568]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[00:22:40.728 --> 00:22:42.008]  Could government let this happen?
[00:22:42.128 --> 00:22:44.069]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[00:22:44.349 --> 00:22:51.355]  Midas has Nick Bereshev's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[00:22:51.395 --> 00:22:53.116]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[00:22:53.176 --> 00:22:56.779]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[00:22:56.819 --> 00:22:59.421]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.763 --> 00:23:03.205]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:03.925 --> 00:23:07.548]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:23:08.189 --> 00:23:11.972]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:23:12.757 --> 00:23:21.344]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:23:22.304 --> 00:23:29.510]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[00:23:30.411 --> 00:23:38.497]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:43.217 --> 00:23:44.218]  Call now.
[00:23:44.238 --> 00:23:47.001]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:39.694]  Think about the arrogance, the aplomb that they're greeted with by all their minions and all their yes-men.
[00:24:40.194 --> 00:24:41.135]  Keep the song rolling.
[00:24:42.096 --> 00:24:42.656]  Think about it.
[00:24:43.576 --> 00:24:53.200]  Think about the fact that John Ewing, Alberto Gonzales and George Bush and all that sick trash thinks that they can just openly say they can torture people to death and torture small children.
[00:24:54.241 --> 00:24:55.722]  The memo says, infant.
[00:24:57.282 --> 00:24:58.023]  An infant.
[00:24:58.983 --> 00:25:00.144]  This is who they are.
[00:25:00.844 --> 00:25:04.545]  You don't need to believe in skull and bones or bohemian grub to know who they really are.
[00:25:05.266 --> 00:25:11.889]  Here it is in their own words, signed, sealed under presidential letterhead.
[00:25:13.667 --> 00:25:17.775]  And here's John Utrine to backpedal in Houston, Texas.
[00:25:18.737 --> 00:25:19.339]  At Rice.
[00:25:20.641 --> 00:25:21.282]  Here it is.
[00:25:21.403 --> 00:25:22.324]  Keep rolling the video.
[00:25:24.047 --> 00:25:28.769]  I'm not saying that we should do any of those things.
[00:25:28.809 --> 00:25:31.510]  But you did in Chicago say if the President orders that.
[00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.091]  Jordan, I didn't.
[00:25:33.511 --> 00:25:34.231]  You said yes.
[00:25:34.291 --> 00:25:42.815]  Can I say what I say or do you not believe everything you read on the internet?
[00:25:42.855 --> 00:25:46.056]  What I said was that it depends.
[00:25:46.596 --> 00:25:48.497]  I didn't say it has to do with law.
[00:25:48.517 --> 00:25:51.238]  I was saying the law and morality are different.
[00:25:51.958 --> 00:25:53.700]  And that you're asking a moral question?
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.742]  Personally, I would not do any of those things under any circumstances.
[00:25:57.282 --> 00:26:02.046]  But that's a different question than what the Constitution allows the President to have as Commander-in-Chief.
[00:26:02.426 --> 00:26:03.587]  Right?
[00:26:03.667 --> 00:26:08.031]  I'm just saying it's a moral issue.
[00:26:08.051 --> 00:26:09.492]  Stop, John Yoo.
[00:26:10.273 --> 00:26:11.253]  Again, now did you hear that?
[00:26:12.234 --> 00:26:17.118]  That's exactly what Alberto Gonzalez said just a few weeks ago, again before the Congress, is he said, well,
[00:26:17.887 --> 00:26:23.731]  You know, there is no habeas corpus under the Constitution, when it's in there twice.
[00:26:25.052 --> 00:26:29.175]  He said there's no right to habeas corpus, and the Senators are going, excuse me?
[00:26:29.875 --> 00:26:31.036]  And that's for U.S.
[00:26:31.076 --> 00:26:31.556]  citizens.
[00:26:32.317 --> 00:26:41.163]  And then now here he is again saying, well, I'm not saying those things are good, but he does have the power to do it, and by the way, that's the exact type of stuff
[00:26:41.858 --> 00:26:42.258]  I don't know.
[00:26:42.359 --> 00:26:43.520]  Not crushing with pliers.
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.603]  Raping with instruments covered with acid.
[00:26:47.903 --> 00:26:48.524]  I'm sorry.
[00:26:49.605 --> 00:26:50.986]  We don't know about any pliers.
[00:26:51.486 --> 00:26:52.027]  Keep rolling.
[00:26:53.067 --> 00:26:54.627]  I don't think it's morally justified.
[00:26:55.267 --> 00:27:01.709]  And, you know, if you want to listen to five-second snippets where someone can't, on the internet, where someone can't, where they cut you off before you can finish your answer.
[00:27:01.749 --> 00:27:03.809]  It's like 30 minutes or an hour long.
[00:27:03.969 --> 00:27:09.490]  And I was very clear after that, that, you know, morally, I was very clear at that time, right?
[00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:20.812]  And I said, I don't think, I don't think... You can write it out like, yes, that's, I know how the question was asked, so... Right, so I was just saying, I don't think a treaty, I don't think a treaty can limit the President's commander-in-chief power under the Constitution.
[00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:23.193]  And that's what I was saying, and I don't think that's the case.
[00:27:23.233 --> 00:27:25.154]  I do... Jordan, I think, has a different view.
[00:27:25.774 --> 00:27:42.100]  I think the President can violate international law, and we can pay the sanctions for it under the international legal system, but I don't think, as a constitutional matter, I could sue the President, or something like that, and say, you, the President, cannot do this action as Commander-in-Chief because we've signed a treaty saying you can't.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:46.161]  In fact, Presidents under our Constitution break treaties and terminate them if he wants to anyway.
[00:27:46.882 --> 00:27:49.142]  So, that's what I was addressing in that.
[00:27:49.183 --> 00:27:50.323]  Okay, let me comment on that.
[00:27:51.676 --> 00:27:56.180]  Is the President allowed to barbecue children on the White House lawn?
[00:27:57.101 --> 00:28:02.986]  Is the President allowed to snort lines of cocaine from the Oval Office on national television?
[00:28:03.847 --> 00:28:10.933]  Is the President allowed to say, nuke Chicago because he feels like it?
[00:28:11.654 --> 00:28:12.435]  The answer is no.
[00:28:12.455 --> 00:28:17.900]  The President executes the law in very limited areas.
[00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:24.899]  The president is a creature of the executive branch.
[00:28:24.919 --> 00:28:28.940]  They call it the unitary executive, claiming it's over the legislative and the judicial.
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:34.982]  If you really read the Federalist, which was even pro-centralized, they clearly say the president is the weakest.
[00:28:35.615 --> 00:28:39.718]  Congress is the strongest, next is judicial, and then executive.
[00:28:39.778 --> 00:28:40.138]  Why?
[00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:46.283]  Because there's a greater separation of powers in the Congress with the Senators and the House members.
[00:28:46.743 --> 00:28:54.849]  And there is a greater representation of the people's will through that representative republic, through that constitutional republic.
[00:28:55.989 --> 00:29:00.132]  It's just off the charts that they claim this power.
[00:29:00.413 --> 00:29:01.854]  They claim the power of dictatorship.
[00:29:01.874 --> 00:29:02.434]  Please continue.
[00:29:03.639 --> 00:29:08.020]  So, that's what I was addressing in that point, and so I'm glad you gave me the chance to clarify that.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.221]  You know, I don't think morally it would be justified.
[00:29:10.241 --> 00:29:12.462]  That's a different question than the legal question.
[00:29:12.982 --> 00:29:14.002]  Okay, another question.
[00:29:14.022 --> 00:29:14.102]  Yes.
[00:29:15.583 --> 00:29:29.727]  Yes, Professor, you said twice this afternoon that you think what was going on in the pictures of Ivan Graham was illegal, but it seems to me that given your comments in one of the movements you wrote, fighting torture, as
[00:29:30.407 --> 00:29:36.730]  We'll be right back and we'll finish up a few more minutes of this and we'll get into the national, international news and a lot more.
[00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:37.631]  We're on the march.
[00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:38.851]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:38.871 --> 00:29:40.492]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.788 --> 00:30:02.469]  Shelly, you make a good... Oh, wait.
[00:30:02.609 --> 00:30:03.709]  Why did you turn that down?
[00:30:03.729 --> 00:30:06.310]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:11.292]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[00:30:11.472 --> 00:30:13.913]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[00:30:14.173 --> 00:30:15.353]  I can do something like that.
[00:30:15.373 --> 00:30:17.794]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[00:30:17.934 --> 00:30:20.835]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[00:30:20.875 --> 00:30:22.696]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[00:30:22.796 --> 00:30:25.037]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[00:30:25.417 --> 00:30:26.057]  I guess you're right.
[00:30:26.437 --> 00:30:28.958]  Why don't we just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night?
[00:30:29.392 --> 00:30:33.634]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[00:30:33.654 --> 00:30:35.315]  I know where we can get some more information.
[00:30:35.736 --> 00:30:40.058]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.

[00:30:49.923 --> 00:30:51.204]  The BedFan is the answer.

[00:31:00.853 --> 00:31:06.860]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.422]  Globalists are concerned
[00:31:13.639 --> 00:31:16.922]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[00:31:17.302 --> 00:31:19.303]  Start reading The Nationalist Times each month.
[00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:24.948]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[00:31:25.248 --> 00:31:33.034]  Published monthly since 1985, The Nationalist Times is a 20-page newspaper featuring outstanding writers and columnists who don't believe in taboos or
[00:31:33.194 --> 00:31:34.435]  We're good to go.
[00:32:00.425 --> 00:32:01.547]  How are you feeling today?

[00:32:35.579 --> 00:32:40.081]  We'll also refer you a website with links to actual testimonials and product information.
[00:32:40.301 --> 00:32:42.443]  Could this fruit help you in your quest for total health?
[00:32:42.763 --> 00:32:46.225]  Find out why Magosteen is known as the Queen of All Fruits.

[00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:54.390]  Again, that's 800-681-1909.
[00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.572]  We're gonna open the phones up here in a few minutes at 1-800.
[00:33:07.415 --> 00:33:09.196]  It turns out it was completely staged.
[00:33:09.216 --> 00:33:10.457]  Just innocent people being raided.
[00:33:10.477 --> 00:33:12.418]  Go check out all the other cases.
[00:33:36.818 --> 00:33:46.046]  An alleged conspiracy to kidnap a British Muslim who served in Iraq and decapitate him on video is the latest terror merry-go-round to be unleashed on the British public.
[00:33:46.486 --> 00:33:58.316]  From past examples, we can safely predict that within a month, the supposed plot will hold about as much credibility as yesterday's scare in Boston, where electronic advertisements for a cable cartoon were mistaken for bombs.
[00:33:59.477 --> 00:34:04.041]  And by the way, don't think for a minute that Time Warner didn't know what they were doing with that
[00:34:05.609 --> 00:34:19.640]  Police are continuing to question nine men arrested over what security sources say was a plan to film a Muslim soldier being executed and posted on the web the BBC reports.
[00:34:20.861 --> 00:34:21.902]  And it goes on.
[00:34:23.474 --> 00:34:26.977]  Mexican Migration Project Director Calls for North American Unions.
[00:34:26.997 --> 00:34:27.898]  This is from JBS.
[00:34:28.218 --> 00:34:37.165]  According to Princeton University Sociologist Douglas Mancey, director of the Mexican Migration Project, the way for America to solve its immigration problems is for the U.S.
[00:34:37.185 --> 00:34:43.029]  and Canada governments to pay for Mexico's infrastructure and social projects, leading to an eventual North American Union.
[00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:50.335]  At Terra.com, a Spanish-language news publication, an article reported on activities that took place in none other than Washington, D.C.
[00:34:50.775 --> 00:34:51.956]  The translation that follows
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:56.203]  And it says, how many of you saw this one on the nightly news?
[00:34:56.684 --> 00:35:17.942]  According to Fernando Montero, who reported the story for Terra.com, Douglas Massey, director of the Mexican Migration Project, stated not only was the United States immigration policy negative and counterproductive, but also Canada and the United States have a financial obligation to build up Mexico itself, which the toll roads, I would add, at SPP.gov, will pay for.
[00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:18.923]  They will tax us here
[00:35:19.543 --> 00:35:22.269]  The money will be given to the Feds, the private company, and to the state.
[00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:23.591]  This is for all the states.
[00:35:24.233 --> 00:35:28.721]  Frontlines are Texas, and it will fund infrastructure in Mexico, which will then accelerate the merger.
[00:35:29.784 --> 00:35:36.386]  Massey commented that NAFTA was deficient because it focused solely on commercial relations for business and left out the people factor.
[00:35:36.426 --> 00:35:38.826]  See, because the answer we need now is total integration.
[00:35:39.247 --> 00:35:42.047]  According to the report, Massey offered this nice sounding bite.
[00:35:42.307 --> 00:35:44.488]  You cannot integrate a market without involving people.
[00:35:44.828 --> 00:35:45.368]  Of course not.
[00:35:45.668 --> 00:35:56.091]  That is why Americans who cherish their nation's independence are opposing to integrating their economic system under NAFTA because ultimately it will lead to a political integration with Mexico, the United States and Canada.
[00:35:56.531 --> 00:35:57.612]  He goes on from page to page.
[00:35:57.792 --> 00:35:59.034]  Let me get into this now.
[00:35:59.394 --> 00:36:01.996]  Something I didn't cover a few weeks ago that needs to be covered today.
[00:36:02.036 --> 00:36:04.358]  I just saw it in a stack and wanted to bring it back.
[00:36:04.378 --> 00:36:07.081]  Then we'll go to Bobby in California and others that are patiently holding.
[00:36:08.642 --> 00:36:12.626]  North American activist plotted stealth strategy.
[00:36:13.046 --> 00:36:13.827]  That's in quotes.
[00:36:14.388 --> 00:36:20.493]  Details of secret BANFF meeting released as part of a four year request.
[00:36:20.894 --> 00:36:21.915]  Freedom of Information Act.
[00:36:21.975 --> 00:36:22.295]  Finally.
[00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:25.402]  Washington, D.C., Joseph Farah.
[00:36:25.782 --> 00:36:32.504]  And this is all from, and you can link over to Judicial Watch and read the actual minutes through the four-year release.
[00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:33.064]  Okay?
[00:36:33.084 --> 00:36:36.565]  You can read literally hundreds of pages for yourself.
[00:36:37.066 --> 00:36:39.206]  And I'll be honest with you, I only read 30 or 40 pages.
[00:36:39.246 --> 00:36:39.806]  I don't have time.
[00:36:40.027 --> 00:36:41.107]  And it was all so horrible.
[00:36:41.147 --> 00:36:42.567]  I could spend an hour on each page.
[00:36:42.627 --> 00:36:45.028]  I mean, it's just nightmare on top of nightmare.
[00:36:45.328 --> 00:36:47.709]  Confirmation on everything we already know.
[00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:50.130]  It's completely diabolical.
[00:36:51.892 --> 00:36:52.532]  Washington.
[00:36:52.572 --> 00:37:13.816]  Participants in a high-level, closed-door, three-day conference on the integration of the three North American nations debated whether openness about goals were preferred to a stealthy policy of building infrastructure before a vision of the end result was even laid out for the people of the U.S., Mexico, Canada, according to notes obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.
[00:37:15.517 --> 00:37:17.477]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:37:19.372 --> 00:37:33.582]  Official notes taken on a session on border infrastructure and continental prosperity at the North American Forum in Banff, Canada last September revealed the internal debate over continued secrecy.
[00:37:33.622 --> 00:37:38.705]  See, secret North American Union already set up operating.
[00:37:40.246 --> 00:37:43.889]  Now finally Lou Dobbs and Glenn Beck and a few others have talked about it on national TV.
[00:37:44.855 --> 00:37:46.836]  Finally it's been in, I don't know, a half dozen U.S.
[00:37:46.896 --> 00:37:50.879]  newspapers, or more really, and all the Canadian papers I've seen have reported on it.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:38:00.106]  But still, you tell a yuppie this, anything that's a threat to them, they'll just deny it exists, because it'll cut into their tennis time or their golf time.
[00:38:00.446 --> 00:38:01.106]  Okay, great!
[00:38:02.187 --> 00:38:03.668]  You want to live like they do in Mexico?
[00:38:03.968 --> 00:38:05.730]  You want your dollar totally devalued?
[00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:07.991]  You want your stock market totally destroyed?
[00:38:08.411 --> 00:38:10.013]  Okay then, don't worry!
[00:38:10.573 --> 00:38:13.395]  You sat back, America's probably too far gone!
[00:38:15.367 --> 00:38:15.787]  Excuse me.
[00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:21.092]  I've just been for 12 years on air trying to... We've had the documents.
[00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:22.073]  This is real.
[00:38:22.273 --> 00:38:23.594]  It's time to stop denying it!
[00:38:23.614 --> 00:38:27.157]  Let me continue.
[00:38:27.977 --> 00:38:36.865]  Official notes taken on the session on border infrastructure and continental prosperity at the North American Forum in Canada last September revealed the internal debate over continued secrecy.
[00:38:37.745 --> 00:38:44.234]  While a vision is appealing, working on the infrastructure might yield more benefit and bring more people on board.
[00:38:44.815 --> 00:38:45.836]  Evolution by stealth.
[00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:50.122]  I recorded the notes discovered amid documents obtained by Judicial Watch.
[00:38:50.162 --> 00:38:50.963]  Story continues.
[00:38:52.230 --> 00:39:03.474]  Several speakers at the event emphasized the importance of deepening economic integration, integrating the energy infrastructure, and development of new institutions between the three North American nations.
[00:39:03.895 --> 00:39:14.979]  Participants promoted the idea of using popular issues, such as concern over climate change, to push integration of energy and environmental governance, and the possibility of imposing a carbon tax.
[00:39:15.699 --> 00:39:20.220]  Nothing to do with saving the earth from the climate change that's happening now.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:24.641]  Caused predominantly by the sun and impervious cover.
[00:39:24.802 --> 00:39:41.566]  Yes, major scientific, vetted, peer-reviewed studies do show human activity is causing, well, fossil fuels, 3% of the increase and 6% by blacktop and black tar roofs and heat sinks.
[00:39:43.985 --> 00:39:47.529]  Because photosynthesis and plants actually absorb and use it and have a cooling effect.
[00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:52.635]  And yes, cities do cover a large percentage of the earth and it is heating the earth.
[00:39:52.755 --> 00:39:57.360]  I have actually spent years now studying this so I could accurately talk about it.
[00:39:59.502 --> 00:40:03.106]  But when you add 3 and 6 together, that's 9% of the heating.
[00:40:05.274 --> 00:40:32.143]  Then, another large percentage point, depending on who studies you look at, it's between another 19 and 25 percent, and again they debate this, is being caused by volcanoes, and that also, but they can't really gauge that because they try to meter the volcanic eruptions, but then also you've got Amazon and other forest destruction, which is destroying the lungs of the earth, is not good.
[00:40:33.397 --> 00:40:50.294]  It's not good, no one can debate that, and it is causing problems so they have trouble metering the volcanic emissions because they know at least a small percentage of that is the fires that are ongoing all over the place.
[00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:55.018]  You look at satellite photos, there are just fires everywhere from Asia to South and Central America.
[00:40:57.828 --> 00:41:03.491]  They then see massive increase in forest coverage in Europe and the U.S.
[00:41:03.571 --> 00:41:05.912]  because of huge replanting programs.
[00:41:06.833 --> 00:41:09.334]  So then you have to integrate different studies on that.
[00:41:10.365 --> 00:41:12.066]  But I'm not a fan of destroying the rainforest.
[00:41:12.226 --> 00:41:13.007]  I'll just tell you right now.
[00:41:13.987 --> 00:41:26.635]  The point I'm trying to make here, and I'm stopping on each line, is that they're saying they're going to cynically use public concern and claim the North American Union will do something about this, and that some carbon tax will do something, when your cars and your factories are 3%.
[00:41:26.676 --> 00:41:26.635]  3%!
[00:41:26.696 --> 00:41:29.477]  Now, the vast majority
[00:41:34.796 --> 00:41:37.737]  Well over 50% is the sun.
[00:41:38.597 --> 00:41:40.817]  There is no debating the numbers.
[00:41:41.317 --> 00:41:46.119]  And from NASA and every other major institution, the sun is heating up.
[00:41:46.239 --> 00:41:52.380]  It is expelling a lot more forms of radiation than it has in the past.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.660]  The entire spectrum that it spews forth.
[00:41:55.181 --> 00:41:57.141]  Visible light being only one component.
[00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:03.425]  Alright, the sun is going wild, the entire solar system is heating up.
[00:42:03.545 --> 00:42:05.166]  Is what man's doing accelerating it?
[00:42:05.327 --> 00:42:05.767]  Certainly.
[00:42:07.648 --> 00:42:15.633]  But, again, you hear all day about fossil fuel emissions and flatulence of bovine cows, that is just nothing!
[00:42:16.453 --> 00:42:17.033]  It's nothing!
[00:42:17.134 --> 00:42:23.357]  And then if you even believe that's causing all of it, which every major study shows it isn't, what does a global tax on it do?
[00:42:23.857 --> 00:42:24.478]  Nothing!
[00:42:27.466 --> 00:42:32.710]  We need to write a big article about this and get this out to everybody, because, you know, there's so many leftists that are just totally conned.
[00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:36.393]  You hate urban sprawl, you hate cars, you hate over-consumption.
[00:42:37.954 --> 00:42:44.179]  Frankly, you look at it, it is pretty corrupted out of control, but their answer is neo-surfdom is even worse.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.783]  So, and you can't have the government come in and regulate this, they'll just use it as a tool of control.
[00:42:50.244 --> 00:42:50.704]  You understand?
[00:42:50.744 --> 00:42:52.145]  Their solutions are frauds.
[00:42:52.165 --> 00:42:54.547]  Let me read this again to you.
[00:42:56.514 --> 00:43:03.537]  Several speakers at the event emphasized the importance of deepening economic integration, integrating the energy infrastructure, and the development of new institutions between the three North American nations.
[00:43:03.797 --> 00:43:15.981]  Participants promoted the idea of using popular issues such as concern over climate change to push integration of energy and environmental governance and the possibility of imposing a carbon tax.
[00:43:16.941 --> 00:43:22.543]  Judicial Watch released yesterday the documents it received in a FOIA request from the U.S.
[00:43:22.883 --> 00:43:24.544]  National Command, Northern Command.
[00:43:25.345 --> 00:43:33.112]  Again, that's what really governs the U.S., is the true shadow government, publicly announced now, out of Colorado Springs.
[00:43:33.172 --> 00:43:33.932]  That is the capital.
[00:43:35.193 --> 00:43:38.096]  And by the way, under nuclear attack, they moved the official capital to Denver.
[00:43:38.776 --> 00:43:43.160]  Judicial Watch released yesterday the documents, and it received a FOIA request from the U.S.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:43.941]  Northern Command.
[00:43:43.961 --> 00:43:46.803]  See, that's who's running the North American Union government.
[00:43:48.985 --> 00:43:50.326]  I mean, it's just right here!
[00:43:50.346 --> 00:43:51.187]  This is incredible!
[00:43:52.328 --> 00:43:53.529]  So the military runs our country.
[00:43:55.146 --> 00:43:58.749]  Judicial Watch released yesterday its documents released in a FOIA request by the U.S.
[00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:11.518]  Northern Command, whose Commander, Admiral Timothy Keating, participated in the conference along with the NORTHCOM Political Advisor, Deborah Bolton, and Plans and Policy Strategy Director, Major General Mark Volchev.
[00:44:12.185 --> 00:44:18.787]  A similar request concerning participation in a North American forum meeting by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is still pending.
[00:44:19.167 --> 00:44:24.588]  At least one attendee of the conference said the meeting was intended to subvert the democratic process.
[00:44:24.608 --> 00:44:25.749]  This is in the minutes!
[00:44:26.089 --> 00:44:27.369]  People are there griping!
[00:44:28.389 --> 00:44:33.711]  Mel Hurtig, a Canadian author and publisher elected as the leader of the National Party.
[00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:34.431]  Get him on!
[00:44:34.751 --> 00:44:35.471]  Get him on!
[00:44:35.571 --> 00:44:36.131]  Get him on!
[00:44:36.471 --> 00:44:38.472]  Mel Hurtig.
[00:44:39.275 --> 00:44:51.985]  A Canadian author and publisher elected as leader of the National Party of Canada told the world that day last fall the idea of the North American Forum is to move the countries toward integration without public consent or even knowledge.
[00:44:54.547 --> 00:45:04.615]  What is sinister about this meeting is that it involved high-level government officials and some of the top and most powerful business leaders in the three countries and the North American Forum is organized
[00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:12.733]  The meeting intentionally did not inform the press in any way of the three countries and had press that attended sign non-disclosure forms I would add.
[00:45:13.994 --> 00:45:20.717]  It is clear that the intention was to keep this important meeting about integration of the three countries out of the public eye and he was there.
[00:45:21.558 --> 00:45:35.005]  The conference raised more suspicions about plans for the future merger of the US, Canada, and Mexico with topics ranging from a vision for North America, opportunities for security cooperation, and demographic and social dimensions of the Northern American integration.
[00:45:37.193 --> 00:46:02.046]  Confirmed participants included Rumsfeld, former Secretary of State George Shultz, he's a legate for the New World Order, that's one who serves the Emperor, who serves as Co-Chairman of the North American Forum, former Central Intelligence Agency Director James Woolsey, who I have on video saying we should build camps for Americans, former Immigration and Naturalization Services Director Doris Meisner, North American Union Guru Robert Pasteur,
[00:46:02.794 --> 00:46:11.878]  Former Defense Secretary William Perry, former Energy Secretary and Defense Secretary James Schlesinger, and top officials of both Canada and Mexico.
[00:46:12.578 --> 00:46:21.422]  But the only media member scheduled to appear at the event, according to documents obtained by World and Daily, was the Wall Street Journal's Mary Anastasia O'Grady.
[00:46:21.723 --> 00:46:30.406]  The event was organized by the Canadian Council of Chief Executives of the Canadian West Foundation, an Alberta think tank that promotes closer economic integration with the United States.
[00:46:30.446 --> 00:46:31.347]  It's their CFR.
[00:46:31.927 --> 00:46:37.649]  The next meeting on the North American Forum is set for October 12th, 24th in Porto Vallarta.
[00:46:38.009 --> 00:46:40.290]  The Canadian event is another in a series of meetings.
[00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:51.634]  Policy papers and directors that have citizens, officials and members of the media wondering whether these efforts represent some sort of coordinated effort to implement a merger, some have characterized as the NAFTA on steroids.
[00:46:51.954 --> 00:46:52.894]  Has us wondering?
[00:46:52.934 --> 00:46:53.515]  It says it.
[00:46:53.535 --> 00:46:59.797]  It's like if I come up and punch you in the nose and break it in blood spewing and you go, I wonder if you just hit me?
[00:47:01.868 --> 00:47:02.009]  Ah!
[00:47:04.591 --> 00:47:06.032]  Northcom running it!
[00:47:08.054 --> 00:47:11.697]  How long have we told you that Road to Tyranny that I made five years ago?
[00:47:12.237 --> 00:47:13.919]  Five years ago!
[00:47:14.339 --> 00:47:17.522]  It was out in February, early February of 2002.
[00:47:20.244 --> 00:47:24.288]  I had a rough version out in two weeks called 9-11 Road to Tyranny Emergency Release.
[00:47:24.748 --> 00:47:26.910]  Within two weeks, shipping!
[00:47:27.779 --> 00:47:28.219]  I don't
[00:47:47.839 --> 00:47:51.120]  My point is that it's all in there, that NORTHCOM will run everything.
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:51.540]  Why?
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:56.101]  I have Army Times, I have Toronto Star, I have official announcements and documents.
[00:47:56.521 --> 00:48:02.062]  Bill Clinton gave a speech in 1993 about how we were going to have a NORTHCOM and a Homeland Security.
[00:48:03.643 --> 00:48:05.663]  The shadow government's been there since 1947.
[00:48:07.644 --> 00:48:10.964]  The terms we hear are at least 14 years old.
[00:48:12.525 --> 00:48:14.265]  No, they didn't just pop up after 2001.
[00:48:15.426 --> 00:48:16.986]  The Council on Foreign Relations
[00:48:19.068 --> 00:48:20.248]  Hart-Rudman Commission.
[00:48:20.808 --> 00:48:21.609]  One year!
[00:48:21.649 --> 00:48:22.689]  They released it in September.
[00:48:23.329 --> 00:48:24.029]  That was the deadline.
[00:48:24.049 --> 00:48:34.371]  That's why PNAC put a report out in September 2000 saying, we're going to be hit by massive terror attacks, we're going to take everybody's rights, we're going to have National ID cards, North Com will run everything, it'll be called Homeland Security.
[00:48:34.731 --> 00:48:42.413]  I mean, it's just... I mean, they get up there three days after 9-11 and Gary Hart says, we're going to use this disaster for a New World Order.
[00:48:44.393 --> 00:48:47.434]  Bobby, in California, thanks for holding your on the air.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:55.622]  Hi, I just want to remind everyone how important it is to make copies of DVDs and get them out to everyone in your area, especially the police.
[00:48:56.382 --> 00:49:05.204]  I haven't heard from the caller, Charles from Louisiana, for a while, but it's important for everyone to know his story, how he... He's handed out almost 7,000 DVDs in VHS.
[00:49:05.364 --> 00:49:15.307]  Yeah, and how he... I heard one episode, you were saying he converted the police in his area and kicked out the feds and stuff.
[00:49:15.607 --> 00:49:17.027]  All of them in his parish, yeah.
[00:49:17.481 --> 00:49:20.624]  Yeah, so everyone could do that in their area too.
[00:49:20.644 --> 00:49:24.487]  But he didn't convert them, they converted themselves by checking out the documentation.
[00:49:24.828 --> 00:49:25.548]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:41.943]  And at first they were threatening to arrest him, handing him out free on the street, and going into coffee shops, and then they were so embarrassed after they watched him, because they'd seen him and they thought it was lies, and then they threatened to arrest him, and then one of them finally checked it out and found that it was true.
[00:49:42.683 --> 00:49:43.984]  That was Police Day 2000.
[00:49:44.024 --> 00:49:48.506]  The cops didn't think it was real that Marines were training to take guns and that we had actual video.
[00:49:48.546 --> 00:49:52.748]  Then they just did some checking and found out the Marines had bragged about it and put it on their own website.
[00:49:53.028 --> 00:49:54.229]  And so, total conversion.
[00:49:54.649 --> 00:49:57.131]  I mean, how do you not convert to reality?
[00:49:57.911 --> 00:49:58.551]  I mean, how?
[00:49:58.611 --> 00:50:01.833]  If you've got any soul, any intellect, any brain.
[00:50:03.454 --> 00:50:04.374]  Of course I'm angry.
[00:50:04.414 --> 00:50:05.335]  Of course I'm aggressive.
[00:50:05.595 --> 00:50:06.936]  I'm sorry that's my style.
[00:50:07.416 --> 00:50:08.817]  My country's going down.
[00:50:09.037 --> 00:50:10.277]  Our country's going down.
[00:50:10.858 --> 00:50:11.578]  Your country.
[00:50:12.845 --> 00:50:15.546]  And it isn't going down into something that's just, you know, milquetoast.
[00:50:15.606 --> 00:50:16.707]  It's going into darkness.
[00:50:17.027 --> 00:50:18.167]  It's going into tyranny.
[00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:19.168]  Anything else?
[00:50:19.448 --> 00:50:19.748]  Bobby?
[00:50:20.268 --> 00:50:25.591]  Oh yeah, um, I'm gonna put a bumper sticker on my car that says, Do you want freedom or fascism?
[00:50:25.731 --> 00:50:27.592]  Ron Paul for President, 2008.
[00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:29.873]  That is an awesome name.
[00:50:32.414 --> 00:50:33.114]  Absolutely.
[00:50:34.175 --> 00:50:34.855]  You are the man.
[00:50:34.875 --> 00:50:35.475]  Anything else?
[00:50:35.915 --> 00:50:39.237]  Yeah, just like everyone, you know, it's important to invest in a DVD copier.
[00:50:39.835 --> 00:50:44.218]  And just get DVDs out, because once they have them in their hand, everyone wants to show their whole family, and then they show us.
[00:50:44.258 --> 00:50:46.460]  But, you know, you never know where the DVD is going to go.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.522]  So you've been having successes yourself?
[00:50:48.662 --> 00:50:49.102]  Oh, yeah.
[00:50:50.863 --> 00:50:51.684]  I want to hear about it.
[00:50:51.784 --> 00:50:52.224]  Stay there.
[00:50:52.244 --> 00:50:54.626]  Then we'll go to Mark and Canada and others.
[00:50:55.006 --> 00:50:58.389]  Then we've got a big guest, a witness to government-sponsored terror.
[00:51:00.405 --> 00:51:08.352]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:51:08.813 --> 00:51:11.976]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[00:52:03.087 --> 00:52:08.553]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:52:08.933 --> 00:52:16.561]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:52:17.259 --> 00:52:24.323]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:52:24.703 --> 00:52:36.129]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:52:36.449 --> 00:52:39.911]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:52:40.411 --> 00:52:42.352]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:52:42.672 --> 00:52:46.514]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:10.419 --> 00:54:11.119]  Welcome back!
[00:54:41.025 --> 00:54:43.546]  All right, let's go back to Bobby.
[00:54:44.426 --> 00:54:47.206]  Bobby, tell me how long you've been making copies of films and what effect it's had.
[00:54:47.226 --> 00:54:48.927]  I love hearing it.
[00:54:49.307 --> 00:54:53.947]  For a couple years, I'd say probably about three years making copies.
[00:54:54.308 --> 00:54:59.048]  And for me personally, I'm an electrician and I always bring them to my job site.
[00:54:59.909 --> 00:55:03.229]  And it's always the same thing, especially since 9-11 Mysteries came out.
[00:55:07.512 --> 00:55:13.196]  I'll start him off with that and after a week or so that's the conversation around all the job sites.
[00:55:23.755 --> 00:55:28.198]  So it's like none of that mystery kind of warms them up for Terror Storm and then, you know... Give it all to them.
[00:55:28.238 --> 00:55:28.798]  Yeah, I love it.
[00:55:28.838 --> 00:55:38.884]  Just please, everybody, make copies of Terror Storm because I frankly think overall it's the best film on the wide view of government-sponsored terror, why they do it, how they've done it.
[00:55:38.904 --> 00:55:43.786]  I mean, this is... Terror Storm, what, the first 30 minutes is just the government admitting all the stuff they've done?
[00:55:43.827 --> 00:55:44.927]  I mean, this is where they admit it!
[00:55:46.588 --> 00:55:47.829]  That they stage terror attacks.
[00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:54.215]  And then we get into new events that we can evidence are government sponsored.
[00:55:55.696 --> 00:55:59.439]  And here we are about to bring you a guest who witnessed operatives on 7-7.
[00:56:01.201 --> 00:56:05.605]  So it's just over time, 9-11 and the other events will be totally documented.
[00:56:07.395 --> 00:56:15.463]  Well yeah, you know, it's always been, you know, people, once people start talking about it, you know, they want more and more.
[00:56:15.483 --> 00:56:17.985]  What percentage of people wake up that you interface with?
[00:56:21.293 --> 00:56:21.974]  Like 85%?
[00:56:22.214 --> 00:56:23.916]  That's the number I found, about 85-90%.
[00:56:24.016 --> 00:56:30.762]  On talk radio, even on adversarial shows with the hoses attacking me, one out of twenty disagrees.
[00:56:30.822 --> 00:56:32.504]  I mean, it's total destruction of the enemy.
[00:56:32.964 --> 00:56:46.677]  I'll be on neocon shows like Lars Larson, and he'll get irritated because every time I've been on, he'll take five or six calls that agree with me, and then one caller that kind of disagrees, which is, well, you've got a lot of stuff right, but you're still
[00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:48.097]  Wrong about this.
[00:56:48.117 --> 00:56:50.438]  I mean, look, look, the truth is out.
[00:56:50.658 --> 00:56:52.518]  We're going to defeat the New World Order, period.
[00:56:52.839 --> 00:56:53.579]  Thanks for the call.
[00:56:54.979 --> 00:56:58.880]  Don't forget, coming up this evening, I'm going to be giving a speech at the UT Union Ballroom.
[00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:01.581]  Details are up on InfoWars.com.
[00:57:01.601 --> 00:57:02.381]  It is a free event.
[00:57:02.941 --> 00:57:06.142]  And they wanted me to go there and speak for two and a half hours and take questions.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:10.701]  And contrary to what most people like to do, I like to share the spotlight.
[00:57:10.721 --> 00:57:21.643]  So I invited George Humphreys, author, documentary filmmaker, former city council member, very successful businessman, Anthony Wilber Crusader to come speak, and of course, Genesis' own, Jack Blood, who follows this broadcast.
[00:57:22.123 --> 00:57:23.464]  He will be speaking.
[00:57:23.484 --> 00:57:25.424]  They're going to speak about 30 minutes.
[00:57:27.305 --> 00:57:28.685]  Well, they're each going to have 30 minutes time.
[00:57:29.355 --> 00:57:29.575]  Yes, we are.
[00:57:53.118 --> 00:58:09.452]  Again, it's going to be huge, it's free, and it's really nice place, great sound system, and I hope to see you all there coming up tonight, here in Austin, Texas, the first day of February, 2007, at the UT Union Ballroom.
[00:58:09.472 --> 00:58:11.494]  In fact, where's the address?
[00:58:11.634 --> 00:58:13.776]  I had it in front of me.
[00:58:17.859 --> 00:58:19.360]  24th and Guadalupe.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.420]  24th and Guadalupe.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.481]  UT Union Ballroom.
[00:58:23.561 --> 00:58:24.442]  Just go to the tower.
[00:58:24.462 --> 00:58:25.942]  The UT Tower.
[00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:27.043]  Just ask, where's the ballroom?
[00:58:27.063 --> 00:58:28.783]  And they'll say, it's right there.
[00:58:29.564 --> 00:58:30.064]  It's here.
[00:58:30.944 --> 00:58:33.065]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:33.105 --> 00:58:33.905]  Take a few calls.
[00:58:34.246 --> 00:58:37.627]  Then get Steve Watson and Daniel Obuchike on.
[00:58:40.276 --> 00:58:45.340]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:45.861]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.041 --> 00:58:46.902]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:46.942 --> 00:58:48.043]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:48.063 --> 00:58:52.046]  You want answers?
[00:58:52.426 --> 00:58:56.670]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:08.502]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.722 --> 00:59:12.824]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.486 --> 00:59:20.648]  Literally waging war on corruption.
[00:59:21.795 --> 00:59:25.479]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:31.686]  Monday through Friday, live from 11 to 2, Central Standard Time.
[00:59:32.286 --> 00:59:33.688]  By the way, I'm tired of forgetting.
[00:59:33.728 --> 00:59:35.290]  I know my staff is listening.
[00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:39.214]  Guys, get me the list of the five affiliates we got last week.
[00:59:39.935 --> 00:59:42.697]  Because I keep saying I'm going to plug them, and I never get a proper list.
[00:59:42.737 --> 00:59:46.619]  I hear the names, I thank the program directors, and then I just forget about it.
[00:59:46.679 --> 00:59:49.101]  I want to get that and thank them before this hour ends.
[00:59:49.121 --> 00:59:52.783]  I want to thank them on the Sunday show that's gotten a lot of new affiliates as well.
[00:59:53.604 --> 00:59:55.365]  We're just so blessed, so thankful to God.
[00:59:55.785 --> 01:00:00.588]  Big guest coming up, eyewitness to government operatives in the 7-7 bombings of 2005.
[01:00:00.948 --> 01:00:02.549]  Right now, Mark in Canada.
[01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:03.530]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:04.390]  You're on the air.
[01:00:04.891 --> 01:00:05.451]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:00:05.611 --> 01:00:05.971]  Good, sir.
[01:00:06.251 --> 01:00:06.451]  Good.
[01:00:06.491 --> 01:00:07.192]  Big fanboy here.
[01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:09.971]  Um, I like Bobby the Caller before.
[01:00:10.011 --> 01:00:12.513]  I've been, uh, I'm burning Terror Storm copies right now.
[01:00:12.533 --> 01:00:14.174]  I've been handing them out in Ottawa.
[01:00:14.334 --> 01:00:15.335]  I go for walks at night.
[01:00:15.355 --> 01:00:18.097]  I give out, um, Terror Storm and 9-11 Revisited.
[01:00:18.477 --> 01:00:19.118]  Well done!
[01:00:19.238 --> 01:00:23.380]  Those are the two I've chosen, and, uh, I just take about eight or nine out at night, walk around.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:28.704]  I always come home without them, so... I don't know if the people watch them, but... That's the best is to fire and forget.
[01:00:28.764 --> 01:00:30.946]  Carpet bombing, InfoWars, the best procedure.
[01:00:31.046 --> 01:00:32.947]  Yeah, that's what I've been doing, so I'm doing my part.
[01:00:33.047 --> 01:00:36.069]  I also went to a rally yesterday, my first protest, so that was kind of cool.
[01:00:36.997 --> 01:00:37.718]  I have questions.
[01:00:37.858 --> 01:00:40.503]  I've been trying to call him for a while, so these are kind of dated.
[01:00:41.527 --> 01:00:46.031]  The Bayer tainted HIV inoculations?
[01:00:46.332 --> 01:00:47.232]  Yes, by design.
[01:00:47.833 --> 01:00:54.418]  Is there anybody who has been looking into the WHO and the Red Cross, International Red Cross's tracking?
[01:00:54.459 --> 01:01:00.163]  Red Cross was caught, it was all over Australian papers, knowing that it had AIDS in it, knowingly delivering it.
[01:01:00.283 --> 01:01:01.384]  It's publicly admitted.
[01:01:01.765 --> 01:01:02.005]  Okay.
[01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:06.489]  Is there anybody who's tracking though the growth of the epidemic?
[01:01:07.189 --> 01:01:09.871]  The Heliophilia Society has tried to.
[01:01:09.911 --> 01:01:19.336]  They've been robbed once and there's been fire bombings as well of the doctor who worked in the prisons in Little Rock.
[01:01:20.297 --> 01:01:23.519]  And so there's been some strange deaths as well.
[01:01:23.939 --> 01:01:25.120]  So yeah, people have been trying.
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.342]  But again, the murders and the fire bombings didn't stop it from coming out.
[01:01:28.702 --> 01:01:29.703]  Okay, okay, excellent.
[01:01:30.523 --> 01:01:33.745]  Would you ever have David Suzuki on your show to discuss global warming?
[01:01:35.665 --> 01:01:36.186]  I don't know.
[01:01:36.206 --> 01:01:37.786]  Who is David Suzuki?
[01:01:37.806 --> 01:01:41.048]  David Suzuki is a big Canadian environmentalist.
[01:01:41.288 --> 01:01:42.909]  He's been around for years.
[01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:45.290]  Now I've heard the name, I had to place it.
[01:01:45.711 --> 01:01:47.251]  Did you hear my analysis of it?
[01:01:47.772 --> 01:01:51.634]  Oh, I've listened to your show since Charlie Sheen came out, pretty much daily.
[01:01:51.754 --> 01:01:52.574]  So what did you think?
[01:01:52.914 --> 01:01:54.295]  Oh, I think you're bang on.
[01:01:54.415 --> 01:02:02.279]  I'm just curious if he would agree with you about the solution that they're proposing, or if he would be saying it's not 3%, it's 10%, that kind of stuff.
[01:02:04.508 --> 01:02:05.828]  Well, listen, that's not me just saying 3%.
[01:02:06.949 --> 01:02:10.769]  I mean, there's a bunch of different studies, and even the U.N.
[01:02:10.809 --> 01:02:15.030]  study says, well, humans are 6% of it, but it still is the tipping point.
[01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:16.611]  The sun's heating up.
[01:02:16.931 --> 01:02:23.272]  And then the point is, regardless, regardless, their solution of a global tax has nothing to do with it.
[01:02:24.012 --> 01:02:24.973]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:02:25.113 --> 01:02:25.753]  Yeah, no, I agree.
[01:02:25.773 --> 01:02:26.353]  I agree.
[01:02:27.533 --> 01:02:37.801]  My next question has to do with Ron Paul and Mike Rivera has been talking about the Jefferson Manual and that it takes one governor to start the impeachment procedures.
[01:02:37.821 --> 01:02:40.803]  And that is starting up in New Mexico and several other states.
[01:02:41.063 --> 01:02:43.946]  Okay, so Ron Paul isn't in a position to start that as well?
[01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:51.712]  They already used it against him in his last campaign ineffectively when he came on my show and said Bush should be impeached.
[01:02:52.293 --> 01:02:59.156]  That was already used against Paul, so I don't know if he will call for something like that because then it would be misinterpreted by conservatives.
[01:02:59.696 --> 01:03:03.577]  But certainly, he says anyone who voted for the war should be removed and impeached.
[01:03:04.498 --> 01:03:06.058]  Okay, okay.
[01:03:06.138 --> 01:03:11.541]  Next question, then nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the other thing that stipulates that the U.S.
[01:03:11.561 --> 01:03:16.102]  can't supply aid to a country that is a nuclear power unless it allows inspectors.
[01:03:17.283 --> 01:03:18.903]  That's another thing Mike Rivera was talking about.
[01:03:19.043 --> 01:03:20.084]  Is that going to
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.902]  Matter like is there any way that they can even enforce that?
[01:03:25.002 --> 01:03:43.431]  No, no, and you can't enforce it and the UN doesn't enforce it and Israel doesn't follow it and China doesn't follow it you know the point is South Africa's got nukes brother Listen, I appreciate your call Pakistan India We'll be right back stay with us big guest
[01:03:55.359 --> 01:04:00.805]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:01.206 --> 01:04:08.814]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:16.590]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:28.417]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.717 --> 01:04:32.220]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.621]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:34.941 --> 01:04:38.804]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:56.094]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:05:56.294 --> 01:05:59.697]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:05:59.857 --> 01:06:03.400]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:06.823]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:06:06.843 --> 01:06:12.367]  This basic tenant of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:06:12.407 --> 01:06:17.552]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[01:06:18.012 --> 01:06:18.733]  We're good to go.
[01:06:29.426 --> 01:06:33.868]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:35.308]  It'll work on other problems as well.

[01:07:01.477 --> 01:07:02.298]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.038 --> 01:07:03.879]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:08.583]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.803 --> 01:07:12.906]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:32.832]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:32.872 --> 01:07:36.655]  Now 8 minutes, 42 seconds into this second hour.
[01:07:36.675 --> 01:07:49.365]  And for the balance of the hour, I'm extremely honored to be joined by Steve Watson of Infowars.net and PrisonPlanet.com from London, England, and Daniel Obuchacki, also joining us from England.
[01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:52.622]  Now, let me just set the table here.
[01:07:53.162 --> 01:08:04.326]  On the morning of 7-7-2005, three bombs blew up, destroying three different train passenger carriages, killing quite a few people, tragically.
[01:08:05.386 --> 01:08:19.871]  Over an hour later, a bus that had been specifically singled out and redirected, and these reports had already come out by other witnesses, exploded, causing quite a few deaths and injuries.
[01:08:20.757 --> 01:08:33.650]  And then it came out that the former head of Scotland Yard's Public Relations, Peter Powers, had been hired to run a drill of the exact same trains, exact same times, being bombed, the exact same day.
[01:08:35.532 --> 01:08:38.555]  And we've had the actuary mathematics done on that.
[01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:40.357]  It's in the tracts of gillions.
[01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:44.444]  That's 43 zeros, my friends, behind it.
[01:08:45.645 --> 01:08:50.129]  That's many, many more times, billions of times more than all the grains of sand in all the world.
[01:08:50.549 --> 01:08:56.234]  On 9-11, they're doing a drill of flying hijack jets in the World Trade Center and Pentagon at the exact same time yet again as well.
[01:08:58.376 --> 01:08:59.757]  It's always the same MO.
[01:08:59.917 --> 01:09:02.359]  They do this in case other compartments of the government discover it.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.962]  The other operatives can just say, hey, we're taking part in a drill.
[01:09:05.702 --> 01:09:07.644]  It also bootlegs the funding
[01:09:08.781 --> 01:09:09.121]  I don't know.
[01:09:22.150 --> 01:09:24.311]  There are hundreds of points concerning the London bombing.
[01:09:24.351 --> 01:09:27.873]  First they said that it was simultaneous and they said no it wasn't simultaneous.
[01:09:28.173 --> 01:09:29.253]  It turned out they were correct.
[01:09:29.273 --> 01:09:33.115]  It was simultaneous bombings on all three of the trains.
[01:09:33.555 --> 01:09:34.456]  Something went wrong.
[01:09:34.536 --> 01:09:39.158]  We had surmised from all the evidence something hadn't detonated on the bus.
[01:09:39.958 --> 01:09:42.259]  People reported there was not an Asian man down there.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.841]  People reported that suddenly there was just an explosion.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.703]  Folks had reported that the bus had been singled out and diverted.
[01:09:49.763 --> 01:09:51.505]  I talked to bus drivers who'd heard about it.
[01:09:51.785 --> 01:09:57.171]  I talked to technicians who worked in that bus terminal about strange things and strange technicians working on that bus.
[01:09:58.493 --> 01:10:03.599]  And so we, from the evidence we had, something hadn't gone off simultaneously in the bus, so they redirected it.
[01:10:03.659 --> 01:10:07.263]  While they were redirecting it, to make sure it went off from all the evidence we have,
[01:10:08.553 --> 01:10:13.397]  So for an hour and several minutes they were announcing a power surge had caused some type of explosions
[01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:38.590]  Now you've got three blown up trains, get people everywhere, they're coming out, bleeding, dying, they're telling everyone bombs went off, and the police are saying, no, no, no, it's a power surge.
[01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:49.974]  While, meanwhile, black sedans, blue sedans, motorcycles are directing this particular bus, the Hackney bus, to Tavistock Park, Tavistock Square.
[01:10:51.294 --> 01:10:56.736]  On board that bus is Daniel Albacheke, and Daniel
[01:10:58.633 --> 01:11:25.392]  is there and he's now going to tell you what he witnessed and this is a eyewitness now other eyewitnesses interviewed by police and again most police aren't involved in this that's why we have Scotland Yard going we don't think these guys knew they had bombs we don't think that they were suicide bombers we think someone gave them these packages but then you got the problem of one of the bombers passports uh... ID cards being found at two different bombings and somebody messed up in the planting
[01:11:26.646 --> 01:11:35.590]  You've got Benjamin Netanyahu being admitted to Associated Press at least 30 minutes before getting a call and being told, don't get on the trains, stay in your hotel room.
[01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:37.391]  This is all on record.
[01:11:38.511 --> 01:11:40.392]  You've got Giuliani there when this happens.
[01:11:40.612 --> 01:11:41.932]  All very suspicious folks.
[01:11:41.972 --> 01:11:43.773]  Same people, same players.
[01:11:43.793 --> 01:11:44.974]  This is so disgusting.
[01:11:46.634 --> 01:11:52.017]  And so we have Daniel there on the bus and he's going to tell you what he witnessed.
[01:11:52.057 --> 01:11:53.697]  This is huge.
[01:11:53.877 --> 01:11:55.178]  I cannot hype this enough.
[01:11:56.064 --> 01:12:00.206]  I know Steve's working on a part two of this, so I want to bring up Daniel.
[01:12:00.226 --> 01:12:01.406]  Daniel, thank you for coming on.
[01:12:02.066 --> 01:12:02.407]  That's okay.
[01:12:02.447 --> 01:12:03.067]  How are you doing?
[01:12:03.807 --> 01:12:04.247]  Good, sir.
[01:12:04.908 --> 01:12:18.713]  Tell us a little bit about yourself, and then give us a nutshell, give us a thumbnail sketch of what happened on that bus that morning, what you witnessed, and then any more details that you haven't already given us for the InfoWars.net story.
[01:12:18.733 --> 01:12:21.634]  And I first want to say, thank you for your courage, sir.
[01:12:21.895 --> 01:12:25.196]  Tell us first about yourself and how you got the courage to go public.
[01:12:26.278 --> 01:12:28.480]  Okay, I'm just a regular guy.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:39.730]  I was born, bred, work in London and that day I was on my way to work in Old Street and there was some kind of disruption going on.
[01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:45.695]  We were told it was a power surge and we were evacuated and that's how I became to be on the bus.
[01:12:47.797 --> 01:12:53.762]  And then after that the bus left Houston full of passengers who were
[01:12:54.346 --> 01:13:05.689]  Also evacuated, and the bus seemed to be going nowhere, so I looked out because I was standing on the lower deck because I wasn't sure whether I was on the correct bus.
[01:13:06.329 --> 01:13:17.152]  And then I peered ahead and I saw these two cars, which were a Mercedes and a BMW, blue and black, which seemed to be in front of the bus, holding it up.
[01:13:17.777 --> 01:13:25.582]  And it was diverted about four or five minutes later down towards Tavistock Square.
[01:13:26.442 --> 01:13:33.066]  And I think the results are quite evident for everyone else to see what took place in Tavistock Square.
[01:13:35.048 --> 01:13:37.669]  Please continue with once you got to the square what you saw.
[01:13:37.689 --> 01:13:45.274]  Oh well, after the explosion you can understand I was on the floor so I
[01:13:46.326 --> 01:13:58.492]  It took about five seconds till the noise had actually quietened down and then I just got up and then I ran and escaped and ran straight down the street.
[01:14:00.153 --> 01:14:05.575]  After a few paces down the street I saw a man holding a camera.
[01:14:05.635 --> 01:14:10.818]  It looks like a camcorder who was walking towards me filming the bus itself.
[01:14:11.896 --> 01:14:21.043]  Um, I was confused by this and I stopped and skidded to a halt and looked left, right and what was going on.
[01:14:21.063 --> 01:14:28.889]  Then I looked behind me and I saw the bus, the upper deck of which had been completely destroyed by the bomb explosion.
[01:14:29.569 --> 01:14:39.977]  Um, and then I just, I think at that point my, my mind must have just changed into some kind of,
[01:14:40.763 --> 01:14:48.183]  I was really, not frightened, but I was aware that something, a myth, was going on and...
[01:14:49.497 --> 01:14:55.081]  I was just looking at the people moving into the actual space on the square.
[01:14:55.121 --> 01:14:57.143]  There were guys who were hanging around.
[01:14:57.163 --> 01:15:04.689]  There was a row of policemen who were just standing there in yellow fluorescent suits, jackets.
[01:15:04.789 --> 01:15:05.750]  They weren't doing anything.
[01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:06.911]  They were just watching.
[01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:10.533]  There was this guy filming and I'm saying, what is going on here?
[01:15:10.894 --> 01:15:12.655]  It didn't feel right.
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:18.404]  I actually went and helped some woman who had been walking beside the bus.
[01:15:18.765 --> 01:15:31.418]  She was covered in blood and then I helped her to get some kind of help at a hotel which was further down the square and I passed this gentleman who seemed to have acquired some kind of
[01:15:32.154 --> 01:15:33.334]  I don't think so.
[01:15:49.469 --> 01:15:58.812]  In fact, you write in your description that within 60 seconds he had a bandage on his head and there weren't even paramedics around him.
[01:15:59.072 --> 01:15:59.552]  Exactly.
[01:15:59.572 --> 01:16:01.013]  They hadn't even shown up yet.
[01:16:01.353 --> 01:16:02.633]  Can you say that in your own words though?
[01:16:02.653 --> 01:16:05.854]  I mean, describe it in detail for us.
[01:16:06.494 --> 01:16:14.357]  Well, he had a bandage around his head and his trouser leg had been slit neatly along the seam and he was
[01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:16.187]  Rolling on the pavement.
[01:16:16.207 --> 01:16:20.749]  This was 50 meters away from the bus itself.
[01:16:21.069 --> 01:16:24.070]  The bus bomb itself blew backwards.
[01:16:24.130 --> 01:16:31.052]  So one lady who was at the back where I was standing, I was standing in the center of the bus or by the window.
[01:16:31.512 --> 01:16:35.314]  She actually died and someone walking behind the bus also died.
[01:16:35.654 --> 01:16:38.895]  So the bus blew backwards, the bomb blew backwards.
[01:16:39.215 --> 01:16:42.556]  So this guy is just a complete fake.
[01:16:43.331 --> 01:16:44.292]  We're good to go.
[01:17:07.219 --> 01:17:11.101]  Watching, taking note, organizing people, moving things.
[01:17:11.121 --> 01:17:20.985]  How many seconds, I mean, how long did it take you to get out of the bus, and then how long did it take you, because you say 60 seconds, to then notice that this guy is way up the street with a bandage on his head rolling around?
[01:17:21.685 --> 01:17:24.146]  I left the bus within 12 seconds.
[01:17:24.526 --> 01:17:27.347]  I got down that street in another 10 seconds.
[01:17:27.688 --> 01:17:33.190]  So within 25 seconds, I had witnessed the cameraman and about
[01:17:34.345 --> 01:17:59.237]  15 seconds after that I actually noted this chap so it was within 45 seconds he was actually with some kind of headband and lying on the street and I don't know how he got there because if it was a bus blast he must have been flung about 40 to 50 feet and that is not really feasible with the injuries which he was displaying.
[01:18:00.541 --> 01:18:02.665]  And it was the wrong direction from the way the blast came out.
[01:18:02.705 --> 01:18:03.867]  Precisely.
[01:18:03.988 --> 01:18:09.217]  How many operative types or police did you see when you got off the bus around you already staring at it?
[01:18:10.139 --> 01:18:12.623]  Okay, there were about four...
[01:18:13.726 --> 01:18:20.730]  Guys in blue bottoms and who had rucksacks, they were kind of foot soldier types.
[01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:25.833]  There were about two or three people who were just standing in the doorway, just watching everything.
[01:18:26.113 --> 01:18:37.559]  And there was another guy who was coordinating everything, coordinating in plainclothes and coordinating police, when they finally came forward to actually do something.
[01:18:39.105 --> 01:18:40.266]  Just all there waiting.
[01:18:40.286 --> 01:18:41.226]  Oh, here comes the bus.
[01:18:41.267 --> 01:18:42.287]  Boom!
[01:18:43.188 --> 01:18:44.028]  Unbelievable, sir.
[01:18:44.088 --> 01:18:44.749]  Please stay with us.
[01:18:44.769 --> 01:18:47.731]  We've got Steve Watson waiting in the wings with other key comments and questions.

[01:19:54.091 --> 01:19:56.612]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:03.743]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:03.943 --> 01:20:06.685]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:06.725 --> 01:20:07.825]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:09.186 --> 01:20:13.789]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:21.974]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:20:22.974 --> 01:20:26.016]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[01:20:28.169 --> 01:20:31.633]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[01:20:52.433 --> 01:20:54.935]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:55.676 --> 01:20:58.358]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:20:59.078 --> 01:21:15.231]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny.
[01:21:16.192 --> 01:21:21.396]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[01:21:22.193 --> 01:21:30.139]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:23:01.154 --> 01:23:05.276]  Daniel Lobachevsky is our guest.
[01:23:05.416 --> 01:23:07.337]  Born and bred Londoner.
[01:23:30.988 --> 01:23:33.589]  Talking during the break, it was just unbelievably powerful.
[01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:41.033]  I remember making Terror Storm and saying to Rob, my editor here in the office, I go, that photo looks fake.
[01:23:41.494 --> 01:23:55.381]  Bandages all over his face, thinly placed, no blood except on his chest, and it looked like it was put on out of a ketchup dispenser, little squirters that you use just kind of dribble down the front.
[01:23:56.722 --> 01:23:58.583]  And so many times my instincts are right.
[01:23:59.358 --> 01:24:07.239]  Well, it turns out that's the individual that, within 60 seconds, was flopping around and prancing around in front of cameras and all the waiting police.
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:17.981]  And notice, though, they didn't... all over every major newspaper in the world, all over every major television network in the world, every news program in the world, no one interviewed him, no one said, where is he now?
[01:24:18.602 --> 01:24:19.722]  No one said his name.
[01:24:19.762 --> 01:24:21.942]  Everybody else they showed bloodier bleeding.
[01:24:22.242 --> 01:24:23.743]  A day later, they'd say, here's their name.
[01:24:24.103 --> 01:24:24.603]  Not him.
[01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.143]  And now the photo's being jerked.
[01:24:27.484 --> 01:24:32.088]  Please relay and repeat the words you told me during the break, Daniel.
[01:24:32.128 --> 01:24:34.610]  Please, in your own words, lay this out.
[01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:48.781]  Yeah, this guy, he was the one that got my kind of curiosity going because I walked past there with this, escorting this woman who was hurt, and then I saw him.
[01:24:48.981 --> 01:24:51.944]  He had this bandage around his head, his leg
[01:24:52.757 --> 01:25:19.581]  seemed to, his trouser leg was torn and this was within 45 less than 60 seconds after the explosion a time before any medical staff had come forward and the thing about him was he just seemed so fake so I thought this man must have had prior knowledge prior intelligence and he was positioned here for what reason I don't know then I
[01:25:20.439 --> 01:25:29.770]  Well, I conducted a search of my own online because a few days after the 7th of July, his picture, his image was everywhere.
[01:25:30.391 --> 01:25:34.135]  And about a month ago I looked and it had been totally pulled.
[01:25:34.656 --> 01:25:37.840]  I mean, it wasn't on any of the BBC websites, it wasn't on
[01:25:38.582 --> 01:25:42.547]  Any of the international news sites, you just couldn't find this guy.
[01:25:43.127 --> 01:25:59.706]  I actually spent about two days searching, and then I got two images of him, and that's what you see on WorldWideWebTheForceBomb.com, which is my site, where the truth and the facts of what happened in Tavistock Square that day are.
[01:26:00.447 --> 01:26:12.395]  Now, again, your story meshes with all the other witnesses, all the other evidence we have, but I want to be clear before I bring Steve Watson up in the next segment, who broke this with you, and I really am thankful for his great journalistic skills and your courage.
[01:26:13.035 --> 01:26:18.259]  Going back, specifics, slow down, take your time.
[01:26:18.779 --> 01:26:30.267]  When you see the blue and black Mercedes and the motorcycle cop and the discussion with the bus driver and it's redirected, let's go back to when they first directed you in the bus to Tavistock Square.
[01:26:32.088 --> 01:26:34.629]  Okay, yeah, um, well, what do you want to know?
[01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:37.751]  The bus was... Just slow down and describe everything to me.
[01:26:37.791 --> 01:26:44.855]  Just slow down and tell me how they pulled up, what they did, what they, you know, what their body motions were like, just everything, what they looked like.
[01:26:45.495 --> 01:26:50.578]  Okay, it left Houston Bus Station and proceeded down Houston Road.
[01:26:51.118 --> 01:26:57.582]  It was supposed to go straight from Houston to Kings Cross, but these two cars were blocking its path.
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:06.323]  And then after a short time, a police motorcyclist whizzed up on his bike and had a word with one of the drivers.
[01:27:06.703 --> 01:27:07.303]  White men?
[01:27:07.343 --> 01:27:08.084]  Black men?
[01:27:08.224 --> 01:27:08.864]  Asian men?
[01:27:08.904 --> 01:27:10.104]  What did they look like?
[01:27:10.124 --> 01:27:14.506]  No, the police, the drivers were of European appearance.
[01:27:15.146 --> 01:27:21.829]  The motorcyclist had a helmet, so he had a brief word with one of the drivers.
[01:27:22.389 --> 01:27:24.730]  And I thought, okay, thank God for that.
[01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:25.630]  This guy
[01:27:26.425 --> 01:27:30.608]  We'll tell the driver to go and then we can get to where we need to be going.
[01:27:31.369 --> 01:27:39.836]  But instead of the police motorcyclist getting the car to leave, they told him to leave and he just turned around and sped off.
[01:27:41.056 --> 01:27:42.878]  Did you see them flash anything?
[01:27:43.398 --> 01:27:44.659]  They didn't flash anything.
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:46.301]  He waved something.
[01:27:46.441 --> 01:27:51.765]  It could have been some kind of card or pass or something, but as soon as the police
[01:27:52.472 --> 01:27:53.072]  Who waved?
[01:27:53.112 --> 01:27:55.033]  The driver of the blue Mercedes or the black?
[01:27:55.374 --> 01:27:57.395]  The driver of the BMW.
[01:27:58.495 --> 01:27:59.876]  And what color?
[01:27:59.896 --> 01:28:01.517]  The BMW was blue, correct?
[01:28:01.617 --> 01:28:02.137]  Blue, yes.
[01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:09.040]  The driver of the BMW waved the motorcyclist away with some form of identification.
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:11.882]  I only assume he had some form of identification.
[01:28:11.902 --> 01:28:13.582]  You saw him, something in the hand waved it.
[01:28:13.903 --> 01:28:14.983]  Yeah, that was it.
[01:28:15.243 --> 01:28:16.064]  Absolutely key.
[01:28:16.104 --> 01:28:16.524]  Stay there.
[01:28:18.636 --> 01:28:20.916]  Your debriefing will continue on the other side.
[01:28:20.936 --> 01:28:22.637]  Steve Watson will join in.
[01:28:22.657 --> 01:28:29.898]  This is absolutely vital, and we're trying to keep this man safe right now by him getting his entire story out in more detail.
[01:28:30.658 --> 01:28:34.619]  I'm Alex Jones, battling the New World Order at point-blank range.
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:43.621]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.101 --> 01:28:45.601]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.609 --> 01:28:49.308]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:56.790]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:28:57.030 --> 01:29:00.572]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:29:00.832 --> 01:29:04.913]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:29:05.214 --> 01:29:06.134]  I was so amazed.
[01:29:06.374 --> 01:29:09.215]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[01:29:09.416 --> 01:29:11.296]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:29:11.677 --> 01:29:16.879]  SoliWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:29:17.339 --> 01:29:23.264]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan Salt.
[01:29:23.544 --> 01:29:25.265]  I figured it would clean really well.
[01:29:25.506 --> 01:29:28.688]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:29:28.888 --> 01:29:32.772]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[01:29:32.792 --> 01:29:34.513]  Plus, the service was great.
[01:29:34.853 --> 01:29:39.996]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit SoleilWellness.com.
[01:29:40.036 --> 01:29:43.177]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness dot com.

[01:29:52.441 --> 01:29:53.122]  Attention!
[01:29:53.382 --> 01:29:54.842]  Attention everyone!
[01:29:54.943 --> 01:29:57.384]  A brand new invention just released.
[01:29:57.464 --> 01:29:59.144]  It's called Wrist Ease.
[01:29:59.205 --> 01:30:02.166]  The new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[01:30:02.831 --> 01:30:09.635]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[01:30:10.175 --> 01:30:23.042]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[01:30:23.502 --> 01:30:27.484]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.

[01:30:32.487 --> 01:30:38.010]  Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.

[01:30:48.575 --> 01:30:50.095]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[01:30:54.013 --> 01:30:58.018]  Hi, I'm Joyce Riley and many of you know that for years I was a cardiovascular heart transplant nurse.
[01:30:58.379 --> 01:31:01.343]  Since that time I've educated myself on the importance of preventative care.
[01:31:01.743 --> 01:31:05.609]  It all begins with providing your heart and vascular system with the building blocks for good health.
[01:31:06.049 --> 01:31:10.075]  Strauss Heart Drops is the original formula that was copied by others but never duplicated.
[01:31:10.695 --> 01:31:15.197]  Strauss Heart Drops were developed by a master herbalist, Jim Strauss, after he suffered a heart attack in 1979.
[01:31:16.277 --> 01:31:19.059]  His doctor said he would only survive if he had heart bypass surgery.
[01:31:19.479 --> 01:31:20.239]  And Jim said no.
[01:31:20.719 --> 01:31:25.021]  He developed Strauss Heart Drops, the formula that has been copied by others, but never been surpassed.
[01:31:25.441 --> 01:31:27.962]  Get the original Strauss Heart Drops, 4-ounce bottle, for only $79.99.
[01:31:29.563 --> 01:31:34.426]  Call the Power Hour at 877-817-9829.
[01:31:34.446 --> 01:31:35.506]  877-817-9829.
[01:31:36.146 --> 01:31:39.448]  You've probably heard about the other products that have tried to copy the Strauss formula?
[01:31:39.708 --> 01:31:41.929]  Well, get the original Strauss Heart Drops by calling 877-817-9829.
[01:31:41.949 --> 01:31:42.209]  That's 877-817-9829.
[01:31:42.249 --> 01:31:45.011]  Now you can really do your heart right with Strauss Heart Drops.
[01:32:07.194 --> 01:32:09.816]  I know it was two years ago or a year and a half ago.
[01:32:09.836 --> 01:32:16.120]  I know that it's not big and spectacular like 9-11.
[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:32.070]  But a lot of people died and it was used when the British nation was refusing to go along with the war in Iraq when Tony Blair had barely hung on to his position when he had lost almost the entire majority that the Labour Party had in Parliament.
[01:32:33.010 --> 01:32:37.185]  And it came right when they were having their big G8 Summit in Glen Eagles.
[01:32:37.961 --> 01:32:42.303]  And it was used as a grandstanding platform to say, see, the terrorists are hitting us.
[01:32:42.704 --> 01:32:43.564]  We've got to get tough.
[01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:52.609]  And every indices, every piece of evidence, even Scotland Yard and other police forces who had real detectives out were going, these guys weren't suicide bombers.
[01:32:52.869 --> 01:32:54.130]  That's buried in the newspaper.
[01:32:54.490 --> 01:32:57.932]  These guys, we think somebody planted this stuff on them or they didn't know.
[01:32:57.992 --> 01:32:59.132]  They don't fit the MO.
[01:32:59.873 --> 01:33:02.694]  There was a bomb under one of the trains, not in it.
[01:33:03.074 --> 01:33:04.115]  Eyewitnesses said that.
[01:33:04.941 --> 01:33:06.562]  You add all these or hundreds of points.
[01:33:06.582 --> 01:33:10.043]  We put them in the film Terror Storm that I hope you'll get from Infowars.com.
[01:33:10.063 --> 01:33:17.265]  That's why it's so important we spend about 30 minutes of the two-hour film or a little bit more than 30 minutes in London documenting this.
[01:33:17.305 --> 01:33:18.706]  And we even show shots of newsstands.
[01:33:18.726 --> 01:33:20.086]  We were there two weeks after the attacks.
[01:33:21.707 --> 01:33:27.169]  And we show newsstands where there's literally like 15, 20 newspapers and magazines and it's all
[01:33:28.890 --> 01:33:33.934]  pictures of the bombing, and half of them are this guy with the thin, one layer of bandage.
[01:33:33.974 --> 01:33:48.123]  Understand folks, I've worked for a large animal vet, my dad's a neurosurgeon, I've been in hospitals, I've worked around it, I've worked in the medical field when I was in college as a dental assistant, but even if you haven't, you know common sense.
[01:33:48.543 --> 01:33:55.248]  You don't take thin gauze bandage, one layer, one
[01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.491]  Later.
[01:33:59.972 --> 01:34:08.742]  And if you even put that on a scuff on your knee that really doesn't bleed but kind of just seeps, you know, when you're playing touch football and you fall down on your knee and it just kind of seeps.
[01:34:09.242 --> 01:34:15.209]  I mean even if it was just seeping, just a microscopic graze, it would stick to his face.
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:28.004]  No, it appears to be a cap, woven heavily on the top, and then just thin, thin one straps around his face, like it was some type of already woven helmet he just put on his head.
[01:34:28.024 --> 01:34:35.106]  45 to 60 seconds after the blast, he's flopping around, way towards the front, 50 yards north of it.
[01:34:36.267 --> 01:34:45.010]  There's other people videotaping, spook types walking around, and then no interviews with him, we never learn his name, he's just, you remember the guy with the bandage.
[01:34:46.744 --> 01:34:55.407]  And those eyes have it all, ferret-like, scanning, calculating, and I just remember going, man, that is, something's going on, that doesn't look right.
[01:34:57.068 --> 01:35:09.032]  And then he has like a potato, a ketchup bottle, you know, that you spray onto your potatoes, you spray onto your french fries, it, like a dribble on his shirt.
[01:35:10.248 --> 01:35:15.752]  And you take movies like The Quiet American by Graham Greene, which is based on real events, they just changed the names.
[01:35:16.192 --> 01:35:30.802]  That's when the Times of London reporter, who's based there in southern Vietnam, he's been recruited by the CIA guy, he doesn't know he's CIA, and the CIA guy's actually running terror attacks to blame it on the North to escalate the war.
[01:35:30.822 --> 01:35:33.424]  This is before the war really kicks off in the late 19...
[01:35:35.261 --> 01:36:02.727]  50s and it's based on true stories that really happened and then all of a sudden he doesn't know he didn't know the guy's CIA and some of these bombings blow up in the square and kill all these women and children and then he's running around the CIA guy giving orders in Vietnamese and the Times of London writer just goes and just leans back and realizes well literally the man you're listening to right now saw something just like you see in that movie
[01:36:04.805 --> 01:36:10.047]  Just like what you see in that fictionalized account of real events in Vietnam.
[01:36:11.528 --> 01:36:11.888]  Okay?
[01:36:12.208 --> 01:36:13.468]  That's why this is so important.
[01:36:13.869 --> 01:36:18.670]  Daniel, I want to go to Steve Watson and bring him up for any questions he's had.
[01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:19.631]  He's been holding for 20 minutes.
[01:36:19.911 --> 01:36:27.194]  But I'd like you to then talk about what happened in a nutshell after all of this.
[01:36:27.914 --> 01:36:30.575]  What started happening from that point on, please, sir?
[01:36:30.615 --> 01:36:30.855]  I will do.
[01:36:32.159 --> 01:36:33.319]  Okay, yeah.
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:41.902]  Well, it took the Police Investigating Anti-Terrorist Branch of Scotland Yard seven months to question me.
[01:36:41.922 --> 01:36:53.186]  I actually called them, contacted the Emergency Information Hotline the following day, but they didn't get back to me until the end of January 2006.
[01:36:54.927 --> 01:37:09.458]  And I just felt it was as though they were trying to whitewash me to make out that I was not even there to actually completely make it look as though I was not even on board the bus.
[01:37:09.478 --> 01:37:12.800]  But it is on record that you were there and there's an upcoming book concerning it.
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:13.480]  Yeah, there is.
[01:37:13.781 --> 01:37:16.182]  That's what The Fourth Bomb, the book, is about.
[01:37:16.343 --> 01:37:18.104]  And what I went through, I had
[01:37:18.997 --> 01:37:33.170]  Some surveillance, some, I don't know whether they were MI5, Anti-Terrorist Branch, or what government organisation, but I had a lot of probing, I even had, I even gave an interview with
[01:37:34.211 --> 01:37:34.752]  I don't
[01:37:52.493 --> 01:37:53.214]  I don't think so.
[01:38:11.630 --> 01:38:12.310]  At all.
[01:38:12.330 --> 01:38:14.331]  In your own words, describe it.
[01:38:14.391 --> 01:38:19.372]  Did you see any, and the other witnesses said they didn't, but did you see any Asian men?
[01:38:20.012 --> 01:38:21.132]  None whatsoever.
[01:38:21.392 --> 01:38:28.433]  None on board the bus, none carrying a rucksack at Houston or on the bus, or at Pasadena Square.
[01:38:30.874 --> 01:38:31.574]  Off the charts.
[01:38:31.834 --> 01:38:33.694]  Just absolutely off the charts.
[01:38:35.595 --> 01:38:39.496]  Now, you described this harassment as overt surveillance, I guess to intimidate you.
[01:38:39.776 --> 01:38:41.336]  Walk us through that, some of the stuff they did.
[01:38:42.513 --> 01:38:50.960]  Um, it just started by following me when I came out of my office, um, on lunch breaks.
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:52.901]  They were waiting on the corner.
[01:38:53.181 --> 01:39:04.350]  There's a place called the Honourable Artillery, um, Barracks, and that's ten minutes from where I worked, and that is where they kept all the dead bodies from the 7-7 attacks.
[01:39:04.730 --> 01:39:09.074]  So the police outside there, every time I used to walk past, they used to, uh,
[01:39:09.915 --> 01:39:27.758]  Have something to say call my name or something like that And I think it was just a campaign trying to put psychological stress and pressure upon me because obviously If it came down to me testifying they want me to be deemed unfit to testify or something like that and
[01:39:28.530 --> 01:39:32.233]  And I think they just didn't want a public inquiry anyway.
[01:39:32.553 --> 01:39:35.876]  So they got their own way and there was no public inquiry.
[01:39:35.936 --> 01:39:37.197]  Any other types of harassment?
[01:39:37.217 --> 01:39:40.119]  And then let's talk about how you finally got your meeting with the police and what they did.
[01:39:40.139 --> 01:39:40.879]  Yeah, well...
[01:39:42.353 --> 01:39:44.354]  I was chased once in Aldgate.
[01:39:44.754 --> 01:39:46.075]  A guy just came after me.
[01:39:46.335 --> 01:40:00.462]  I had arranged to meet someone from the office and then I got there, this guy came after me so I actually ran into this building and then he ran in there and followed me and I actually hid in some offices.
[01:40:01.263 --> 01:40:02.584]  What did he look like?
[01:40:03.044 --> 01:40:06.708]  I'm not saying I'm a tough guy, but if somebody wants to run up on me, I'm going to deck them.
[01:40:06.728 --> 01:40:08.070]  I guess it's smarter to run.
[01:40:08.751 --> 01:40:09.832]  Explain to me what happened.
[01:40:09.872 --> 01:40:10.773]  Describe it in detail.
[01:40:10.993 --> 01:40:11.734]  What did he look like?
[01:40:11.974 --> 01:40:13.716]  Did he growl and start running at you?
[01:40:13.736 --> 01:40:16.339]  He was actually there waiting for me.
[01:40:16.379 --> 01:40:16.979]  That's the thing.
[01:40:19.682 --> 01:40:20.562]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:40:20.622 --> 01:40:20.982]  I think so.
[01:40:44.530 --> 01:41:03.566]  You know, I just thought here, see and I'm stupid, my instinct was I would have gotten a fight, but you're smart because by then you knew it was police and actually they would have then got you claiming you just assaulted an officer and you know the 50 cameras on you in the surveilled city of four and a half million would have all malfunctioned and they would have claimed you assaulted an officer.
[01:41:04.046 --> 01:41:04.927]  Yeah, precisely.
[01:41:04.987 --> 01:41:06.988]  That's what they were trying to do all along.
[01:41:07.028 --> 01:41:12.130]  Because they asked my flatmate whether I had any criminal convictions.
[01:41:12.150 --> 01:41:16.012]  They were already delving into my background and my past.
[01:41:16.532 --> 01:41:24.156]  Trying to find out whether I had any kind of dodgy or criminal past or tendencies or convictions.
[01:41:24.516 --> 01:41:30.179]  And I think they were trying to use that as a kind of weapon with which they could find me.
[01:41:30.499 --> 01:41:31.059]  It's a lever.
[01:41:31.079 --> 01:41:33.540]  That's what spooks and operatives and informants do.
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:35.120]  We develop that here locally.
[01:41:37.061 --> 01:41:37.921]  Please continue.
[01:41:38.241 --> 01:41:40.182]  I want to bring Steve Watson up.
[01:41:40.202 --> 01:41:41.522]  You're just telling so much more now.
[01:41:41.842 --> 01:41:42.862]  Steve, thanks for holding.
[01:41:43.303 --> 01:41:45.603]  Any other key points you want to bring up here with Daniel?
[01:41:47.064 --> 01:41:59.547]  Well, I was just going to say, why do you think it is that the police didn't ask you to come in and give a statement straight away, but it was later revealed that
[01:42:00.478 --> 01:42:08.745]  They relied on the testimony of people who were at the scene, but, you know, they were either injured or even unconscious in some cases.
[01:42:09.446 --> 01:42:18.833]  And also, could you talk about, you know, some of the phone calls that you got from, you said you got some phone calls from different police departments across the country.
[01:42:19.054 --> 01:42:22.116]  And you posted those up on your website as well.
[01:42:22.156 --> 01:42:23.057]  Yeah, talk about that.
[01:42:24.139 --> 01:42:28.045]  Um, yeah, they were from the West Yorkshire Police Constabulary.
[01:42:28.446 --> 01:42:37.159]  They were the police constabulary investigating the four alleged bombers and one of them
[01:42:38.143 --> 01:42:43.666]  decided to call me one evening and suggest something which I couldn't make out.
[01:42:43.766 --> 01:42:45.286]  I said, hey, you've got the wrong number, guy.
[01:42:45.967 --> 01:42:50.909]  And he continued and called the following day and I recorded it and posted it on the web.
[01:42:50.969 --> 01:43:00.014]  It just says that I had a vehicle which was involved with transporting something or other to do with the investigation into the 7-7 bombings.
[01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:05.262]  You know, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, I forgot to do this.
[01:43:05.462 --> 01:43:16.326]  John, will you go to his website, and again, Daniel, give my producer at the network your website again, we've got a link to it on Apple Wars.
[01:43:16.786 --> 01:43:23.548]  World Wide Web, The Fourth Bomb, it's 4-4-4-t-h-bomb.com.
[01:43:23.568 --> 01:43:26.970]  Yeah, go to thefourthbomb.com, and I know I've listened to that a few days ago.
[01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:30.611]  Where specifically is that clip so we can grab that right now and play it?
[01:43:31.124 --> 01:43:39.568]  Yeah, if you go to one of the four boxes, I think it's the third box.
[01:43:41.309 --> 01:43:47.252]  You also got audio on the web and video from the police interrogating you.
[01:43:47.493 --> 01:43:48.413]  Let's tell that story.
[01:43:48.553 --> 01:43:53.216]  Finally, six months later, after demanding it, you get there meeting with them.
[01:43:53.236 --> 01:43:53.876]  Tell us about that.
[01:43:55.086 --> 01:43:59.730]  Um, it, it was just, it wasn't as much as I had hoped it would.
[01:43:59.810 --> 01:44:04.675]  They just took my details, but what they did was, um, he rushed through it.
[01:44:04.775 --> 01:44:06.697]  It took four hours, but he rushed through it.
[01:44:07.037 --> 01:44:13.503]  He was, it wasn't really as if they were depending on my information and eyewitness accounts.
[01:44:14.287 --> 01:44:25.654]  As a vital part of the inquiry, because of course they had already completed their inquiries or whatever they wanted to say were their inquiries months ago.
[01:44:25.934 --> 01:44:35.821]  So what they did was they waited till they worked out their story and then kept me running and then brought me in and just said, hey, okay, what's your story?
[01:44:35.921 --> 01:44:38.462]  Just so that they could do their paperwork.
[01:44:38.562 --> 01:44:39.983]  But that's all it was, just paperwork.
[01:44:40.143 --> 01:44:41.524]  Tell folks about the diagram.
[01:44:43.633 --> 01:44:44.653]  Oh, the diagram.
[01:44:44.914 --> 01:44:47.595]  Um, are you talking about which one?
[01:44:47.615 --> 01:44:49.295]  Because there's been quite a few.
[01:44:49.315 --> 01:44:54.297]  Oh yeah, the bus diagram, which they, um, asked me to, um, sign.
[01:44:54.878 --> 01:45:07.923]  The bus diagram which they asked me to mark out, um, where the people were sitting on the bus and where the people were standing and what happened on the bus, it, the diagram was the complete wrong
[01:45:08.630 --> 01:45:09.570]  Lay out for the bus.
[01:45:10.210 --> 01:45:18.232]  And I said to the anti-terrorist branch detective who was taking my statement, this is completely incorrect.
[01:45:18.292 --> 01:45:25.714]  So by me signing this, that's just going to make, just going to render everything which I've told you inadmissible.
[01:45:26.434 --> 01:45:28.034]  So I think it was just a ploy.
[01:45:28.054 --> 01:45:31.495]  They didn't really want my information, as you would understand.
[01:45:34.475 --> 01:45:35.135]  Amazing.
[01:45:36.316 --> 01:45:38.437]  Steve, there's a lot of other facets to this.
[01:45:39.117 --> 01:45:41.779]  Any other questions you've got for the guest we have?
[01:45:42.719 --> 01:45:57.987]  Yeah, I would also point out that, you know, Daniel had a shirt, which I believe he still has, with, you know, victim's blood on it, which should have been taken for forensic testing, but they weren't even interested in that either.
[01:45:58.507 --> 01:46:00.548]  It's as if they've worked out previously
[01:46:01.024 --> 01:46:09.192]  You know, a line to take on this, and they weren't deviating from the line, even though you've got, you know, a first-hand witness here saying this is incorrect.
[01:46:09.252 --> 01:46:11.894]  You've got a layout of the bus which is incorrect.
[01:46:11.934 --> 01:46:17.580]  I mean, if this doesn't tell us that we need an independent inquiry on this, then what else does?
[01:46:21.124 --> 01:46:21.384]  Okay.
[01:46:21.664 --> 01:46:45.015]  Knowing what you know now, knowing all the evidence concerning government involvement or black ops involvement, intelligence involvement in past attacks and in the 7-7 attack, seeing your bus erected by these shadowy government characters, seeing people on the ground seconds after it happened, the fake bandages, what do you think was really going on there?
[01:46:45.075 --> 01:46:46.496]  Who do you think was behind the bombings?
[01:46:49.615 --> 01:46:58.101]  I know who wasn't behind the bomb of the bus, but I couldn't really hazard a guess.
[01:46:58.321 --> 01:47:02.564]  It was obviously someone with a lot of power higher up.
[01:47:03.044 --> 01:47:07.708]  So, I mean, I've got to live out here, so it's quite obvious who did it.
[01:47:08.985 --> 01:47:11.387]  Unless I can actually provide evidence.
[01:47:11.407 --> 01:47:12.808]  That's what the website is about.
[01:47:13.068 --> 01:47:15.910]  Putting the evidence out there so people can decide for themselves.
[01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:17.472]  But who didn't do it?
[01:47:17.532 --> 01:47:20.634]  Because you didn't see an Asian, no one else on record said they did.
[01:47:20.674 --> 01:47:22.095]  Yeah, Haseeth Hussain didn't do it.
[01:47:22.796 --> 01:47:26.198]  Haseeth Hussain didn't blow up the bus, but hey, who did?
[01:47:26.318 --> 01:47:28.560]  So, that's what we've got to find out.
[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:30.582]  And that's what we're all working towards.
[01:47:30.982 --> 01:47:32.083]  And the truth will out.
[01:47:32.944 --> 01:47:34.045]  That's one thing I know.
[01:47:34.105 --> 01:47:40.350]  Everything you're doing, everything like-minded individuals are doing will feed to that.
[01:47:42.231 --> 01:47:42.892]  Absolutely.
[01:47:43.152 --> 01:47:50.218]  This is just off the charts powerful and again it fits with the other witness testimonies, all the other information we have.
[01:47:51.479 --> 01:47:57.123]  How do you think individuals who did carry this out can live with themselves just killing innocent
[01:47:59.476 --> 01:48:02.947]  I don't think they, um...
[01:48:03.937 --> 01:48:32.977]  really care they have a role and they have a an objective and their goal is doing that if it kills people they say hey that's just how it goes we're saving you from the evil terrorists and all the crazy people in the world who are out to destroy you so they see that they probably see their role as on helping people even though they're just killing people yeah we gotta kill a few so they'll accept security to keep them safe exactly
[01:48:33.914 --> 01:48:34.855]  Totally sick!
[01:48:34.875 --> 01:48:35.475]  Steve Watson?
[01:48:37.136 --> 01:48:58.250]  Yeah, I mean, if we do delve into a bit of the evidence, we've got, you know, numerous advance warnings from other intelligence agencies, from French, Spanish, the Saudis, who said, you know, gave an exact time frame for this, and Scotland Yard themselves, who, you know, told the Israeli Embassy on the very morning, minutes before that it was going to
[01:48:58.857 --> 01:49:19.888]  It was going to go off, and Benjamin Netanyahu, who was in a hotel on Tavistock Square, which is a point that is often missed, he was told to stay in the hotel, which, you know, that kind of proves that they had precise location information as well, so we need to keep working towards outing the truth on this.
[01:49:20.376 --> 01:49:30.984]  Well, we need to put this guy's face up everywhere, and we've got, look, we've got technologies to scan his face, do a composite by reducing to the lines beneath the bandages.
[01:49:31.004 --> 01:49:41.332]  I actually know some police sketch artists who can, we can use computer mapping to get this guy's face.
[01:49:42.413 --> 01:49:47.176]  This is the type of stuff we'll put a six feet under, but what the hell?
[01:49:47.457 --> 01:49:48.718]  We gotta stop the murderers.
[01:49:55.629 --> 01:49:58.812]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:59.152 --> 01:50:01.094]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.454 --> 01:50:09.101]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.784 --> 01:50:16.848]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.248 --> 01:50:28.694]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.974 --> 01:50:32.476]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:32.937 --> 01:50:34.878]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.198 --> 01:50:39.040]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:48.151 --> 01:52:49.672]  Big John.
[01:52:51.012 --> 01:52:54.093]  Big John.
[01:52:54.213 --> 01:52:56.934]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[01:52:56.974 --> 01:52:59.135]  He stood 6 foot 6 and weighed 245.
[01:52:59.215 --> 01:53:02.176]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[01:53:02.276 --> 01:53:05.477]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lip to Big John.
[01:53:07.623 --> 01:53:09.404]  Big John!
[01:53:10.384 --> 01:53:12.725]  Big John!
[01:53:13.205 --> 01:53:14.886]  Big Bad John!
[01:53:16.106 --> 01:53:18.047]  Big John!
[01:53:19.287 --> 01:53:21.908]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home.
[01:53:21.968 --> 01:53:24.609]  He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:29.091]  Didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy, but he spoke it all.
[01:53:29.111 --> 01:53:30.932]  He just said hi to Big John.
[01:53:33.169 --> 01:53:46.096]  Somebody said he came from New Orleans, where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen and a crashing blow from a huge right hand sent a Louisiana fella to the promised land, Big John.
[01:53:46.736 --> 01:53:48.437]  Big John!
[01:53:49.537 --> 01:53:51.839]  Big John!
[01:53:52.339 --> 01:53:54.680]  Big Bad John!
[01:53:55.961 --> 01:53:56.561]  Welcome back.
[01:53:57.101 --> 01:54:02.044]  I tell ya, the courage of our guest, Daniel Obachicky,
[01:54:03.247 --> 01:54:04.547]  The courage of Steve Watson.
[01:54:04.567 --> 01:54:07.808]  They're over there in London in one of the biggest police states in the world.
[01:54:07.868 --> 01:54:10.449]  I mean, you try to videotape on the street, they come over and tell you to shut it off.
[01:54:10.789 --> 01:54:12.309]  They don't allow protesting now.
[01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:14.210]  There's secret police everywhere.
[01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:18.331]  It is certainly like something out of V for Vendetta.
[01:54:19.011 --> 01:54:21.051]  But the good news is, more and more is coming out.
[01:54:21.091 --> 01:54:23.732]  You know, 80-something percent know they killed Diana now.
[01:54:24.112 --> 01:54:26.413]  Eighty-plus percent know they killed Dr. David Kelly.
[01:54:26.433 --> 01:54:28.833]  And everybody knows they're a bunch of criminals.
[01:54:29.653 --> 01:54:30.994]  And you're coming down.
[01:54:31.074 --> 01:54:32.454]  Your New World Order is going to fail.
[01:54:33.627 --> 01:54:42.492]  And your big, fat German commander, Sachs-Coburg-Gotha, your criminality will be exposed.
[01:54:43.492 --> 01:54:44.453]  And that's just the way it is.
[01:54:45.733 --> 01:54:50.295]  Daniel and Steve Watson, we've got you for a few minutes here, and then five minutes the next, I'm going to let you go.
[01:54:50.856 --> 01:54:53.957]  Any other points that need to be made, please make them now.
[01:54:54.017 --> 01:54:56.799]  And my final question, why did you go public?
[01:54:56.819 --> 01:54:57.739]  When did you go public?
[01:54:58.019 --> 01:54:59.240]  Daniel, give us that timeline.
[01:55:00.524 --> 01:55:03.908]  I had to go public, it was the only thing I could do.
[01:55:04.389 --> 01:55:18.867]  They were constantly harassing me, and even when I was trying to work and get jobs, they were getting in there and holding me, preventing me from gaining employment, so I had to fight back somehow, and the only way
[01:55:19.674 --> 01:55:25.859]  To get back is by making sure what it is they didn't want to be out there was out there.
[01:55:25.919 --> 01:55:32.544]  So that's what the book, the forthcoming book, theforthbomb.com and the website is all about.
[01:55:32.664 --> 01:55:38.469]  Just to, it's actually something which is helping me as well, helping me get through it.
[01:55:39.128 --> 01:55:40.510]  Now, who's publishing this?
[01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:50.663]  I saw a little note in your narrative that you exclusively gave us, sections of the book, but you mentioned that the publisher's like, well, let's not get into the guy with the bandages, that's not too important.
[01:55:50.924 --> 01:55:52.225]  What do you mean that's not too important?
[01:55:52.246 --> 01:55:53.287]  I hope that ends up in the book!
[01:55:56.946 --> 01:56:01.848]  He is referred to in the book but it doesn't actually enhance the story that much.
[01:56:02.028 --> 01:56:11.193]  There is another guy who was in the square that day, an agent, who I'm going to put something on one of the internet sites like
[01:56:11.893 --> 01:56:12.874]  We're good to go.
[01:56:34.517 --> 01:56:40.822]  Well, it's gonna be on... on those... you know those TV websites where you can download media?
[01:56:41.002 --> 01:56:42.163]  I'm gonna stick it on one of those.
[01:56:42.763 --> 01:56:45.085]  So that, um... I'm just trying to find out where you got the video.
[01:56:46.377 --> 01:56:49.799]  It was actually televised on the British television.
[01:56:49.859 --> 01:56:55.322]  I understand, so that's what I just guessed, is that later you saw the news and said, hey, that's the guy, you've got a clip of it.
[01:56:55.362 --> 01:57:00.725]  Buddy, if you're pulling pictures of the other one, you better get that up now and not wait until the book comes out.
[01:57:00.765 --> 01:57:02.406]  I'm telling you, Daniel, you're not stupid.
[01:57:02.506 --> 01:57:02.986]  I'm not waiting.
[01:57:03.266 --> 01:57:03.907]  You're not stupid.
[01:57:03.927 --> 01:57:04.907]  You know how dangerous this is.
[01:57:06.863 --> 01:57:10.725]  They just screamed it on TV because they thought no one would recognize him.
[01:57:10.885 --> 01:57:14.706]  But because I was there, I just jumped and nearly hit the ceiling when I saw that.
[01:57:15.167 --> 01:57:16.327]  And you were able to record it.
[01:57:16.367 --> 01:57:17.127]  Oh, this is again.
[01:57:17.708 --> 01:57:18.688]  Again, they're arrogant.
[01:57:18.728 --> 01:57:19.148]  Stay there.
[01:57:19.208 --> 01:57:19.848]  Final segment.
[01:57:19.868 --> 01:57:24.210]  We'll play some clips when we get back of these strange phone calls and things.
[01:57:24.791 --> 01:57:25.751]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:25.811 --> 01:57:26.311]  Stay with me.
[01:57:28.152 --> 01:57:32.814]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNLive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:44.697 --> 01:57:45.337]  Big Brother.
[01:57:45.997 --> 01:57:47.057]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:47.778 --> 01:57:48.898]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:49.538 --> 01:57:50.358]  You want answers?
[01:57:51.099 --> 01:57:53.019]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:53.039 --> 01:57:56.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:56.860 --> 01:58:00.942]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.897 --> 01:58:25.165]  Engaging the Global Crime Syndicate at point-blank range, going in, through, and beyond, fearlessly defending the Constitutional Republic, defending the UK, defending all sovereign nations against globalist takeover.
[01:58:25.686 --> 01:58:36.592]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and Daniel Obitake is our guest, along with our writer and editor of Infowars.net and contributor to PrisonPlanet.com, Steve Watson.
[01:58:37.501 --> 01:58:38.342]  We have one clip.
[01:58:38.362 --> 01:58:39.623]  There's video clips, a lot more.
[01:58:39.663 --> 01:58:43.007]  You've got to visit the Fourth Bomb website.
[01:58:43.027 --> 01:58:45.550]  We'll give you before our guest leaves here in just a few minutes.
[01:58:45.930 --> 01:58:50.155]  But this clip we're about to play, again, briefly describe this phone call you got.
[01:58:50.175 --> 01:58:51.416]  You got one from him the next day.
[01:58:51.436 --> 01:58:52.938]  You were smart enough to record it.
[01:58:52.958 --> 01:58:53.859]  Tell us what we're about to hear.
[01:58:55.081 --> 01:59:08.952]  Yeah, it's a call from West Yorkshire Police, the police who were investigating the four bombers, and it was, I got this August, which was about a month or so after the 7th of July bombing.
[01:59:09.872 --> 01:59:15.357]  And again, they were there videotaping all the victims so they'd know who to intimidate and control for whoever was an unconscious.
[01:59:15.497 --> 01:59:16.558]  Here's the clip right here.
[01:59:16.578 --> 01:59:18.739]  I'm calling from South Yorkshire Police.
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:20.941]  Ah, go ahead.
[01:59:21.121 --> 01:59:23.683]  Try to get some correspondence out to yourself.
[01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:29.043]  A vehicle with this telephone number on.
[01:59:29.243 --> 01:59:32.265]  We've tried to send some correspondence to the address of the company.
[01:59:32.305 --> 01:59:33.906]  Is the company correct?
[01:59:34.466 --> 01:59:35.347]  What company?
[01:59:36.187 --> 01:59:37.028]  Jumbo Freight.
[01:59:38.169 --> 01:59:39.670]  Sorry, I think you have the wrong number.
[01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:42.411]  I don't have the wrong number because it's wrote on the back of the van.
[01:59:42.511 --> 01:59:42.972]  One minute.
[01:59:43.912 --> 01:59:44.833]  Jumbo Freight.
[01:59:45.113 --> 01:59:46.134]  It doesn't ring a bell.
[01:59:47.034 --> 01:59:49.436]  OK, I think we should go back and do some homework.
[01:59:49.976 --> 01:59:50.717]  No, excuse me.
[01:59:53.641 --> 01:59:54.782]  And so you hung up on them?
[01:59:55.342 --> 01:59:56.063]  I did, yeah.
[01:59:56.203 --> 02:00:01.806]  And you're walking down the street and cops are going, ha ha ha, it's Daniel Obocegi, ha ha ha!
[02:00:02.006 --> 02:00:02.867]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:00:03.887 --> 02:00:05.128]  It's all real fun!
[02:00:05.188 --> 02:00:06.909]  It's real fun to be a bunch of thugs!
[02:00:07.109 --> 02:00:08.610]  It's real fun to push people around!
[02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:11.552]  It's real fun to be involved in killing women and men!
[02:00:11.772 --> 02:00:12.573]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:00:13.013 --> 02:00:17.836]  Yeah, um, they followed me on, like, buses, trains, everywhere I went.
[02:00:18.276 --> 02:00:22.519]  I mean, it was just, it got so much, so I was just trying to keep myself together.
[02:00:22.939 --> 02:00:28.340]  That's why I put this together because, hey, if any event, I'm not here, the book will still be here.
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:29.081]  That's how it is.
[02:00:29.981 --> 02:00:32.221]  So you've already faced the fact that they may kill you.
[02:00:32.461 --> 02:00:34.702]  I think that lessens as you go more and more public.
[02:00:35.402 --> 02:00:36.542]  Well, maybe.
[02:00:36.562 --> 02:00:37.222]  Who knows?
[02:00:37.843 --> 02:00:39.903]  Odd things improve or things get worse.
[02:00:39.963 --> 02:00:42.964]  So you've got to take precautions and contingencies.
[02:00:43.384 --> 02:00:46.085]  But, hey, I'm not really afraid of anything.
[02:00:46.225 --> 02:00:47.085]  I'm moving forward.
[02:00:47.525 --> 02:00:51.386]  This is going to be out there thanks to people like yourself.
[02:00:51.866 --> 02:00:58.127]  Well, yeah, I'd just say that, you know, everything that we're doing is towards getting a public inquiry going on this, because once, if that ever happens, then, you know,
[02:01:22.619 --> 02:01:24.221]  The whole thing would just fall apart.
[02:01:24.402 --> 02:01:29.109]  They want us to believe that it's just, you know, four people who just decided to bomb something one day.
[02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:29.690]  Well, it's not.
[02:01:30.291 --> 02:01:33.537]  It goes a lot deeper, and that's what we need to work towards.
[02:01:34.167 --> 02:01:44.073]  Well, the key is this guy with the bandages on his head, they're totally staged, and the other individual that Daniel saw giving everybody orders, who he's now gotten off television news.
[02:01:44.814 --> 02:01:49.977]  Steve, you ought to get a camera and get over there and interview Daniel, you know, to get this up with the clip.
[02:01:50.217 --> 02:01:50.797]  This is big.
[02:01:50.837 --> 02:01:52.038]  We've got to keep working on this.
[02:01:52.338 --> 02:01:54.440]  When is the part two to the story going to come out, Steve?
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:56.461]  It'll be tomorrow.
[02:01:58.502 --> 02:01:59.463]  Well, I commend you.
[02:01:59.483 --> 02:02:01.344]  I commend both of you.
[02:02:02.239 --> 02:02:04.441]  And if you've got anything else you want to add, we can hold you over.
[02:02:04.481 --> 02:02:06.402]  If not, I will say goodbye for now.
[02:02:07.243 --> 02:02:07.543]  Okay.
[02:02:07.783 --> 02:02:12.006]  Thanks for your hard work and thanks.
[02:02:13.127 --> 02:02:13.387]  No.
[02:02:13.647 --> 02:02:14.828]  Thank you, Daniel.
[02:02:14.888 --> 02:02:18.310]  It's people like you that have courage and have their heads screwed on straight.
[02:02:18.330 --> 02:02:19.191]  You're extremely credible.
[02:02:19.231 --> 02:02:20.552]  It's on record you were on that bus.
[02:02:20.912 --> 02:02:25.415]  And everything you say mirrors and meshes with all the other information we have.
[02:02:25.475 --> 02:02:26.976]  Also, again, I want to thank you, Steve.
[02:02:27.337 --> 02:02:30.639]  It's an honor to be associated with true men of courage like yourselves.
[02:02:31.747 --> 02:02:32.187]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:02:33.048 --> 02:02:33.808]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:38.551 --> 02:02:46.575]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:46.895 --> 02:02:48.836]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:49.196 --> 02:02:56.800]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:02:57.549 --> 02:03:04.594]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:04.994 --> 02:03:16.422]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:16.723 --> 02:03:20.305]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:20.685 --> 02:03:22.627]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:22.947 --> 02:03:26.810]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:39.921 --> 02:03:45.003]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:45.063 --> 02:03:52.385]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:03:52.525 --> 02:04:03.148]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:04:03.349 --> 02:04:07.890]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:08.190 --> 02:04:13.172]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:04:13.372 --> 02:04:16.333]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:16.553 --> 02:04:26.217]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[02:04:26.437 --> 02:04:31.286]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:04:39.716 --> 02:04:44.279]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:04:44.699 --> 02:04:47.620]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:04:47.941 --> 02:04:50.502]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:04:50.862 --> 02:04:55.685]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:04:56.065 --> 02:05:01.428]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:05:01.748 --> 02:05:04.710]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:05:04.890 --> 02:05:05.450]  We're good to go.
[02:05:28.297 --> 02:05:33.766]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:05:33.906 --> 02:05:34.207]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:05:41.138 --> 02:05:47.163]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:47.764 --> 02:05:50.806]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:51.267 --> 02:05:55.510]  Welcome back already into the last 52 minutes of this transmission.
[02:05:55.790 --> 02:06:02.516]  You just joined this amazing interview with a survivor of the London bus bombing, clearly government operation.
[02:06:03.537 --> 02:06:07.220]  A detailed report up on Infowars.net and Part 2 tomorrow.
[02:06:08.803 --> 02:06:13.405]  As we follow this mystery man with the stage bandages and a lot more.
[02:06:14.686 --> 02:06:16.567]  Big risk here fighting these criminals.
[02:06:16.607 --> 02:06:19.749]  These are cold-blooded killers, but we're doing the best we can.
[02:06:21.169 --> 02:06:30.414]  The Project for a New American Citizen student group is putting on a huge event tonight at the UT Union Ballroom and that is at 24th and Guadalupe.
[02:06:33.075 --> 02:06:34.336]  I hope to see you all there.
[02:06:34.356 --> 02:06:36.217]  It's just right down by the big UT Tower.
[02:06:36.877 --> 02:06:38.398]  It holds over a thousand people.
[02:06:38.418 --> 02:06:44.521]  We just started plugging in Monday, so I would imagine about 500 will probably show up from past experiences at local events.
[02:06:44.641 --> 02:06:45.501]  I want to see you there.
[02:06:45.541 --> 02:06:46.181]  It's going to be great.
[02:06:46.602 --> 02:06:49.143]  They wanted me to speak for two hours plus, but I decided, hey,
[02:06:49.853 --> 02:07:06.047]  Why not bring George Humphreys, former city council member, documentary filmmaker, author, lecturer, for a speech on the New World Order for 30 minutes, then Jack Blood for 30 minutes, and then I'll speak for an hour, and then we'll all three get up there and take questions for another 30, 45 minutes or so.
[02:07:06.687 --> 02:07:08.309]  It is going to be extremely powerful.
[02:07:08.329 --> 02:07:09.830]  You're welcome to bring your video cameras.
[02:07:10.210 --> 02:07:11.151]  You're welcome to tape it.
[02:07:11.992 --> 02:07:14.294]  I want to just see everybody out there tonight!
[02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:20.543]  We're talking about only 6 hours and 20 minutes and 30 seconds from now.
[02:07:21.544 --> 02:07:25.146]  I'll be taking the stage up there and emceeing the event.
[02:07:25.166 --> 02:07:31.069]  I want to say great job to the guys from Project for a New American Citizen who are doing this.
[02:07:31.089 --> 02:07:38.554]  You can simply go to Infowars.com to find the map and details if you're from outside Austin, Texas and don't know where the UT Union Ballroom is.
[02:07:38.694 --> 02:07:40.975]  Also, before we go to Wayne Madsen and the Wayne Madsen Report,
[02:07:43.087 --> 02:07:45.688]  I just got another 1,000 American Freedom to Fascism.
[02:07:45.728 --> 02:07:47.248]  We just ran out yesterday.
[02:07:47.288 --> 02:07:51.330]  We have another 1,000 of these suckers right here.
[02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:58.492]  And it exposes the Federal Reserve, the income tax, who the globalists are, their national ID card, North American Union Plan.
[02:07:58.572 --> 02:08:00.953]  It is Aaron Russo's crowning achievement.
[02:08:00.973 --> 02:08:04.094]  And when you purchase it, you do support Aaron Russo.
[02:08:04.779 --> 02:08:05.779]  And myself as well.
[02:08:05.839 --> 02:08:13.002]  So please, if you've already seen it online, or you've got a copy of it from somebody, if you haven't bought a copy from us, or even if you already have, buy a couple more copies.
[02:08:13.062 --> 02:08:14.023]  April 15th is coming up.
[02:08:14.043 --> 02:08:15.443]  We need to expose this corrupt system.
[02:08:15.463 --> 02:08:17.024]  We need to get the word out to people.
[02:08:17.044 --> 02:08:18.224]  It is such an important film.
[02:08:18.284 --> 02:08:20.445]  Get America, Freedom to Fascism 1995 from InfoWars.com.
[02:08:23.820 --> 02:08:24.980]  We'll ship it out to you, UPS.

[02:08:41.484 --> 02:08:42.905]  It is such a powerful film.
[02:08:43.285 --> 02:08:45.565]  All these declassified examples of government-sponsored terror.
[02:08:45.865 --> 02:08:51.987]  You get it for half off, $9.95, when you get it with America, freedom to fascism.

[02:08:53.767 --> 02:08:54.548]  Do not wait.

[02:09:56.196 --> 02:09:57.137]  I really don't do that.
[02:09:57.578 --> 02:09:58.819]  This is your donation to us.
[02:09:58.839 --> 02:09:59.920]  This is how you support us.
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:03.224]  And you get a material, you know we'll do good in the community, and you support us.

[02:10:04.506 --> 02:10:08.710]  We're buying a thousand DVDs to get a discount on them.
[02:10:08.730 --> 02:10:09.131]  They're cheap.
[02:10:09.431 --> 02:10:10.673]  So we like to get these out to people.
[02:10:11.578 --> 02:10:13.519]  But it's the message that's numero uno.
[02:10:13.999 --> 02:10:15.080]  And so it's all a synergy.
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:16.000]  It all comes together.
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:22.104]  So please, take action and order as many copies as you would like to get out to people at InfoWars.com.
[02:10:22.164 --> 02:10:25.445]  My 15 films, the dozens of other films and books that we carry.
[02:10:25.845 --> 02:10:28.187]  Wayne Madsen, thank you for holding during that diatribe.
[02:10:28.567 --> 02:10:29.627]  It's always good to have you on.
[02:10:29.647 --> 02:10:32.729]  You did work with the National Security Agency and other highly classified groups.
[02:10:33.309 --> 02:10:41.352]  And you have WayneMadsenReport.com and you've broken massive national story after national story weeks or months before it comes out mainstream news.
[02:10:41.652 --> 02:10:45.153]  I watched you for several years because it was so wild the stuff you were putting out.
[02:10:45.193 --> 02:10:45.933]  I know it was true.
[02:10:46.394 --> 02:10:48.654]  So many times it got vetted and documented.
[02:10:48.994 --> 02:10:50.315]  I haven't found you to be wrong yet.
[02:10:50.695 --> 02:10:59.078]  So you are a very valued, as I've told you before, I want the listeners to know, contributor to this show and thank you for coming on today.
[02:10:59.758 --> 02:11:00.980]  Hi Alex, good to be with you again.
[02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:02.381]  It's good to have you with us.
[02:11:02.401 --> 02:11:05.064]  For the listeners that don't know who you are, a little bit about yourself, a little bit about the site.
[02:11:05.544 --> 02:11:07.666]  Then, uh, oh, guys, I forgot.
[02:11:07.907 --> 02:11:11.770]  Did you get the Jesse Jackson confrontation clip I told you to get yesterday for this interview?
[02:11:13.332 --> 02:11:14.333]  Did you ever find that, John?
[02:11:15.674 --> 02:11:16.916]  Okay, just go to YouTube then.
[02:11:16.936 --> 02:11:18.037]  I guess you aren't listening.
[02:11:18.357 --> 02:11:18.938]  It's my fault.
[02:11:18.978 --> 02:11:20.239]  I give orders while I'm on air.
[02:11:20.279 --> 02:11:21.140]  That's how busy I am.
[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:22.201]  Please go to YouTube.
[02:11:22.261 --> 02:11:22.761]  I know it's there.
[02:11:22.802 --> 02:11:23.142]  I saw it.
[02:11:23.940 --> 02:11:31.048]  Type in Jesse Jackson 911 DC and you should be able to pull it up.
[02:11:31.068 --> 02:11:32.710]  I want to play that later if we can find it again.
[02:11:33.131 --> 02:11:38.076]  Tell us about yourself and then about the DC peace rally that got taken over by 9-11 Truth.
[02:11:39.236 --> 02:11:41.777]  Well, I have a background in intelligence.
[02:11:41.878 --> 02:11:48.101]  As you mentioned, I was with the National Security Agency during the Reagan Administration.
[02:11:48.121 --> 02:11:51.583]  I was in Naval Intelligence for some years.
[02:11:53.224 --> 02:11:55.545]  The site I have now, WayneMasterReport.com,
[02:11:56.198 --> 02:12:11.964]  I've seen, one of the things that's lacking in Washington is with the demise of good old Drew Pearson's and Jack Anderson's Washington Mirror Go Round, which was a very popular syndicated column that really exposed dirt in Washington.
[02:12:11.984 --> 02:12:17.026]  It didn't really go through a lot of hoops and gatekeepers.
[02:12:17.527 --> 02:12:23.269]  Since that column, we see these guys in this city getting away with, literally, with murder.
[02:12:23.949 --> 02:12:34.971]  And I saw a need to just put the, you know, what I hear on a daily basis in coffee shops, bars, the National Press Club, wherever I hear it, just get it out to the rest of the country and the world.
[02:12:37.892 --> 02:12:41.893]  Let's get into what happened Saturday and then I want to get your view on what's happening geopolitically right now.
[02:12:42.773 --> 02:12:46.354]  Well, Saturday we, of course, we had the numbers game played again by the
[02:12:47.310 --> 02:12:48.471]  By the major media.
[02:12:48.531 --> 02:12:51.412]  They use the same old code word.
[02:12:51.693 --> 02:12:52.553]  Tens of thousands.
[02:12:52.593 --> 02:12:57.356]  We've seen it happen before when there were many more than that involved in these anti-war marches here.
[02:12:57.376 --> 02:13:00.578]  And then the headlines picked up thousands.
[02:13:00.698 --> 02:13:09.603]  But from what I could see, I was at the first two anti-war marches here in Washington before the war started.
[02:13:09.683 --> 02:13:10.404]  The massive ones.
[02:13:10.424 --> 02:13:12.085]  There's been smaller ones, certainly.
[02:13:13.610 --> 02:13:27.120]  I'd say at least 150,000, probably 200,000 people, maybe a little bit more than that, were here in Washington on Saturday, and the demographics were unlike what I had seen before.
[02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:34.205]  This looked like the crowd you would find at the Fourth of July celebrations on the Mall.
[02:13:34.265 --> 02:13:37.648]  The same kinds of people, largely middle class,
[02:13:38.308 --> 02:13:39.168]  We're good to go.
[02:13:58.437 --> 02:14:00.278]  You know, I saw this at the RNC in 2004.
[02:14:01.018 --> 02:14:15.606]  I went up to the Empire State Building, and I later saw some photos that didn't get widely circulated, and I would be looking at a cross-section of, say, ten major avenues converging down on Madison Square Garden with police trying to block everything off and make it as hard as possible.
[02:14:16.006 --> 02:14:18.087]  So many people that you'd have ten roads
[02:14:18.907 --> 02:14:25.652]  Uh, you know, maybe 10, 15 blocks deep, each one, wall to wall, each street had like 100,000.
[02:14:26.013 --> 02:14:27.894]  It had to be over a million people.
[02:14:27.934 --> 02:14:29.976]  I've never seen anything like it, and the news said 200,000.
[02:14:30.236 --> 02:14:32.037]  Right, right, right.
[02:14:32.477 --> 02:14:33.798]  And you know what they do here?
[02:14:34.839 --> 02:14:36.040]  Take the Washington Mall.
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:47.747]  We know from past demonstrations, going back to the Martin Luther King march and other anti-Vietnam War marches in the 60s, that you can put a million people in the Washington Mall.
[02:14:47.827 --> 02:15:01.836]  So what the National Park Service cleverly did some years ago after Bush came in is they put snow fences up so you can't get people into the mall because parts of it are blocked off, which forces them off onto the side streets, which
[02:15:02.236 --> 02:15:02.617]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:15:19.435 --> 02:15:22.537]  They can get away with saying tens of thousands, because they're not counting the people.
[02:15:22.557 --> 02:15:29.543]  Well, here in our free country, every time Bush is inaugurated, they have giant black fences put up, the troops are called out, they point guns at people.
[02:15:29.863 --> 02:15:32.004]  I mean, we're a dictatorship!
[02:15:32.505 --> 02:15:35.067]  We're a dirtbag, third-world country if this continues!
[02:15:35.187 --> 02:15:42.812]  That's right, and I mean, yeah, we've got Bush Institute at some I-never-thought-I'd-hear-in-this-country free speech zones, First Amendment zones.
[02:15:42.872 --> 02:15:43.613]  It's outrageous.
[02:15:45.534 --> 02:15:47.476]  Continue with your observations.
[02:15:48.170 --> 02:15:50.273]  Well, there were many, many groups represented.
[02:15:50.314 --> 02:15:52.276]  You mentioned the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:15:52.337 --> 02:15:53.418]  They were there in force.
[02:15:54.552 --> 02:16:04.019]  This was a group, although it was anti-the Iraq surge, there were people that didn't think we should have been in Iraq in the first place.
[02:16:04.039 --> 02:16:12.364]  A lot of groups were opposed to any sort of military attack on Iran, but it was basically people who had it with Bush.
[02:16:12.705 --> 02:16:17.087]  I talked to some of these people, some of them voted for Bush in 2000 and are disgusted now.
[02:16:19.509 --> 02:16:20.749]  They had been Republicans.
[02:16:21.029 --> 02:16:26.271]  Well, now Limbaugh and Hannity and Savage are really turning the heat up against Shang.
[02:16:26.631 --> 02:16:28.851]  If you protest the war, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:16:29.972 --> 02:16:34.113]  Well, I mean, we know these guys are, you know, as nuts as Bush is.
[02:16:34.233 --> 02:16:45.335]  I mean, they put out these talking points that come out of the, you know, the neocon crowd and the RNC, and I think people need to just stop paying attention to them.
[02:16:45.355 --> 02:16:47.516]  I'm glad Congress is finally starting to talk about
[02:16:47.916 --> 02:16:48.936]  We're good to go.
[02:17:09.862 --> 02:17:13.565]  I think that should be reversed pre-1996 Telecommunications Act.
[02:17:13.985 --> 02:17:20.189]  But any folks going in and saying what you can and can't say on talk radio, that's not going to be used against Limbaugh.
[02:17:20.209 --> 02:17:21.810]  It's going to be used against me.
[02:17:22.411 --> 02:17:23.051]  Possibly.
[02:17:23.151 --> 02:17:26.173]  I'm just happy that you're talking about breaking up those cartels.
[02:17:26.193 --> 02:17:27.334]  I agree with you on that.
[02:17:28.094 --> 02:17:29.636]  Yeah, no, it's the cartel issue.
[02:17:30.856 --> 02:17:33.418]  Again, for those that don't know, it's the same thing as a monopoly.
[02:17:33.718 --> 02:17:37.621]  It's not a monopoly, but they all team together in boardrooms and set policy.
[02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:43.202]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:17:43.502 --> 02:17:48.425]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:17:48.686 --> 02:17:53.048]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:17:53.329 --> 02:18:02.254]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:18:02.455 --> 02:18:06.077]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:18:06.357 --> 02:18:11.406]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:18:11.686 --> 02:18:18.398]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:18:18.897 --> 02:18:19.578]  What about you?
[02:18:20.198 --> 02:18:25.562]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:18:39.898 --> 02:18:40.878]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:18:40.978 --> 02:18:45.740]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:53.703]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:18:53.983 --> 02:18:59.345]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:18:59.565 --> 02:19:06.527]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:19:06.847 --> 02:19:12.174]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:19:12.434 --> 02:19:17.180]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:25.110]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:19:25.430 --> 02:19:31.693]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:19:31.993 --> 02:19:33.674]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:35.855 --> 02:19:36.435]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:36.536 --> 02:19:42.258]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:42.278 --> 02:19:45.840]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts No.
[02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:51.483]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:19:52.498 --> 02:19:57.421]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[02:19:58.501 --> 02:20:00.302]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:20:00.722 --> 02:20:01.543]  There may be more.
[02:20:02.683 --> 02:20:09.487]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[02:20:10.167 --> 02:20:18.011]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:18.852 --> 02:20:20.372]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800,
[02:20:21.903 --> 02:20:27.068]  5-1-6-8-7-3-6 That's 1-800-5-1-6-8-7-3-6 Call now, our operators are standing by to take your order.
[02:20:41.212 --> 02:20:45.353]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:20:45.573 --> 02:20:47.333]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:20:47.594 --> 02:20:53.875]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:20:54.175 --> 02:21:00.296]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:21:00.537 --> 02:21:06.558]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[02:21:06.858 --> 02:21:08.480]  With no side effects.
[02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:13.266]  The 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:21:13.426 --> 02:21:16.950]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[02:21:17.251 --> 02:21:20.975]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[02:21:21.155 --> 02:21:23.699]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:21:23.839 --> 02:21:24.880]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:26.601]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:48.496 --> 02:21:56.400]  Wayne Madsen, shifting gears and we'll open the phones to the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:21:56.420 --> 02:21:57.500]  800-259-9231.
[02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:01.562]  What is the scuttlebutt in Washington?
[02:22:02.322 --> 02:22:04.563]  What's some new breaking news that may be coming out?
[02:22:05.263 --> 02:22:07.324]  Really, where does the attack on Iran stand?
[02:22:07.344 --> 02:22:09.125]  We know they've been wanting to hit them for the last month.
[02:22:09.765 --> 02:22:10.906]  Where do you see all that going?
[02:22:11.326 --> 02:22:15.468]  Well, the Iran situation, we still
[02:22:15.848 --> 02:22:28.706]  I don't know where this administration is heading, but we do know that the neoconservative bunch want to hit Iran, and it appears that Bush is still listening to these crazies, including Cheney.
[02:22:33.002 --> 02:22:38.368]  A couple of weeks has been out of the Libby trial, Scooter Libby, the Vice President's former Chief of Staff.
[02:22:38.408 --> 02:22:39.329]  Let's walk through that.
[02:22:39.649 --> 02:22:40.049]  Yeah.
[02:22:40.510 --> 02:22:52.342]  You know, there's a lot of attention being paid to this handwritten memo by Cheney, the Libby-Cheney memo, where Cheney says, I'm not going to sacrifice any crosses out the Prez.
[02:22:53.242 --> 02:23:01.570]  And then he says, I'm not going to sacrifice one staffer, meaning Libby, for another staffer, meaning Rove.
[02:23:01.630 --> 02:23:05.873]  And a lot of people think he means to say, I'm not sacrificing the President.
[02:23:06.374 --> 02:23:08.295]  But I read it a little differently.
[02:23:08.375 --> 02:23:13.600]  I read it as, I'm not going to sacrifice this one staffer, Libby, who stuck his neck out for the President.
[02:23:14.321 --> 02:23:15.901]  You know, that's fine.
[02:23:15.941 --> 02:23:17.022]  People can argue about that.
[02:23:17.182 --> 02:23:24.423]  There's another thing that was released on January the 30th that I've got up on my website today.
[02:23:25.144 --> 02:23:39.407]  It's minutes of a meeting, and it's referred to as Bush's Senior Staff Meeting, sometime after Joe Wilson's op-ed piece in the New York Times, where he said, look, Bush was full of it when it came to this yellow cake out in Niger,
[02:23:40.670 --> 02:23:45.224]  There's a meeting and we don't get too many chances to have
[02:23:45.915 --> 02:23:47.736]  Insights into the Bush administration.
[02:23:47.756 --> 02:23:51.598]  It's the most secretive administration on record, and that includes Nixon.
[02:23:52.998 --> 02:24:13.088]  And what we see from the minutes is, discussed at this meeting, right after the Wilson op-ed piece, is Mikhail Kotorkovsky, who is the Yukos, Russian oil company executive, who is now in jail because Putin put him in there for tax evasion and fraud.
[02:24:13.548 --> 02:24:27.171]  He was a colleague in a company of Boris Berezovsky, and we know all about Berezovsky with this Litmanenko thing, because it appears to me, anyway, and people have told me, that it looks like Litmanenko was involved in maybe a dirty bomb plot.
[02:24:27.211 --> 02:24:29.092]  He was dealing with the Chechen guerrillas.
[02:24:29.512 --> 02:24:35.854]  Berezovsky makes no bones about the fact that he says he's the grandfather of the Chechen Mujahideen.
[02:24:35.894 --> 02:24:41.455]  Now remember, these are the same Chechens who the neocons are always saying are allied with Osama bin Laden.
[02:24:41.995 --> 02:24:58.228]  So, we have to put all this in perspective, but Khodorkovsky is discussed, the Turks are discussed, and we know that Litvinenko and Berezovsky were using the Turks to supply the Chechens with materials, and maybe including radioactive material, and here's the real kicker in this.
[02:24:58.248 --> 02:25:03.532]  So, are you saying this is a U.S.-Israeli-slash-replay of the Afghan-Russian War?
[02:25:03.972 --> 02:25:04.772]  I think it could be.
[02:25:04.832 --> 02:25:05.493]  It could be.
[02:25:05.553 --> 02:25:06.333]  It seems that way.
[02:25:06.373 --> 02:25:08.914]  But here, the real kicker is on that same list is the name A.Q.
[02:25:09.514 --> 02:25:12.195]  Khan, the Pakistani nuclear scientist.
[02:25:12.675 --> 02:25:15.196]  With the mention of the Turks, A.Q.
[02:25:15.256 --> 02:25:19.518]  Khan and Khodorkovsky, which is really Yukos and Berezovsky and all these other
[02:25:19.918 --> 02:25:20.198]  I think so.
[02:25:36.085 --> 02:25:58.537]  What I've always suspected, although Cheney and Gange were against Joe Wilson and wanted to hang him out to dry, I really always believed that the real target of Cheney and these guys like Libby, and remember Libby was the attorney for Mark Rich, the international smuggler who Clinton pardoned in the 11th hour because he was having an affair.
[02:25:58.557 --> 02:26:00.118]  Yeah, it's always the same players.
[02:26:00.198 --> 02:26:02.580]  Yeah, it's Clinton Bush, Clinton Bush.
[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:13.990]  And what I see is that the real target of Cheney and his gang was Valerie Plain Wilson's Brewster Jennings network, which was rolling up these networks, these smuggling, nuclear smuggling networks.
[02:26:14.798 --> 02:26:19.100]  I agree with that.
[02:26:19.981 --> 02:26:22.542]  Burning Wilson was just like a side bonus.
[02:26:22.842 --> 02:26:31.127]  It was really about the criminal network blowing the cover of different echelons of the intelligence and security branch that were doing their job.
[02:26:37.511 --> 02:26:56.487]  And the question is, we've been hearing this a while from the intelligence community, how many people in CIA, Defense Intelligence, NSA, and I know it's all compartmentalized, know that there was more than just burning men, it was about blowing networks.
[02:26:56.867 --> 02:26:57.748]  It was, and it did.
[02:26:57.828 --> 02:27:08.240]  It rolled up the entire counter-proliferation network that had been put together over the years by... Which Bush signed W199I, ordering the FBI to back off AQ Khan Laboratories.
[02:27:08.420 --> 02:27:09.421]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:27:09.461 --> 02:27:17.750]  And now we see it was a discussion in Bush's senior staff right after, when they were doing the workup on Wilson, and obviously on Valerie Plain Wilson.
[02:27:19.273 --> 02:27:23.799]  And that's why Bush is in deep trouble, because so many people in their own system are now leaking.
[02:27:23.839 --> 02:27:26.963]  We'll talk about leaks and take your calls on the other side.
[02:27:30.628 --> 02:27:33.632]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:34.553 --> 02:27:37.237]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:40.706 --> 02:27:41.266]  Hi, Michelle.
[02:27:41.306 --> 02:27:42.667]  I haven't seen you on the bus for a while.
[02:27:42.968 --> 02:27:44.008]  Did they change your shift?
[02:27:44.168 --> 02:27:44.669]  No, Lori.
[02:27:44.949 --> 02:27:46.190]  I finally quit my job.
[02:27:46.450 --> 02:27:48.631]  I'm working at home now, and I love it.
[02:27:49.032 --> 02:27:49.932]  No more commuting.
[02:27:50.392 --> 02:27:52.614]  And I'm home when the kids get out of school.
[02:27:52.774 --> 02:27:53.635]  Working at home?
[02:27:54.035 --> 02:27:54.675]  Doing what?
[02:27:54.955 --> 02:27:55.876]  It's a long story.
[02:27:56.196 --> 02:27:59.298]  It all started when I discovered the website EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[02:27:59.538 --> 02:28:01.880]  Oh, Michelle.
[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:04.602]  You didn't fall for one of those internet deals, did you?
[02:28:04.822 --> 02:28:07.764]  Well, I looked into several, and this one is for real.
[02:28:08.084 --> 02:28:09.004]  Are you sure?
[02:28:09.024 --> 02:28:14.285]  I didn't quit my job until I was sure, and now I'm making way more money working at home.
[02:28:14.525 --> 02:28:14.885]  Really?
[02:28:15.085 --> 02:28:18.626]  I've joined the Success Team and their major advertising co-op.
[02:28:18.886 --> 02:28:23.347]  Our business is fully automated, which gives me more money and the time to enjoy it.
[02:28:23.627 --> 02:28:25.708]  I'll be earning money while we're skiing this winter.
[02:28:25.848 --> 02:28:27.028]  What was that website again?
[02:28:27.188 --> 02:28:29.829]  Earnmoneyathome123.com.
[02:28:29.909 --> 02:28:30.909]  Here, write it down.
[02:28:31.009 --> 02:28:31.489]  Good idea!
[02:28:31.969 --> 02:28:34.170]  EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[02:28:34.430 --> 02:28:36.190]  Maybe we can go skiing this winter, too!
[02:28:36.470 --> 02:28:39.411]  EarnMoneyAtHome123.com is a global opportunity.
[02:28:40.352 --> 02:28:43.953]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?

[02:28:58.817 --> 02:28:59.397]  I think so.
[02:29:14.650 --> 02:29:15.010]  I don't know.
[02:29:33.371 --> 02:29:35.272]  To Northern Voice Bookstore, P.O.
[02:29:35.292 --> 02:29:38.514]  Box 281, Wildwood, PA 15091.
[02:29:39.974 --> 02:29:42.696]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[02:29:43.076 --> 02:29:50.039]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription filled.
[02:29:50.139 --> 02:29:51.540]  That's over 46% savings!
[02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:54.201]  The average savings for generic drugs was over 71%.
[02:29:56.062 --> 02:30:04.488]  RxDrugCard.com is the only major discount prescription drug plan that offers a price lookup page, so you can get an idea of your discounted price before you enroll.

[02:30:12.313 --> 02:30:12.613]  I think so.
[02:31:02.676 --> 02:31:04.877]  And every word you say.
[02:31:04.917 --> 02:31:06.057]  That's right, government.
[02:31:24.796 --> 02:31:30.581]  Those that run the government, you're so criminal you're putting cameras, microphones everywhere, RFID in the products to track us.
[02:31:31.201 --> 02:31:32.162]  But we have nothing to hide.
[02:31:32.622 --> 02:31:34.263]  We know it's an attempt to control.
[02:31:34.964 --> 02:31:36.305]  You have something to hide.
[02:31:36.946 --> 02:31:40.528]  And we're watching you, in and out of government, in industry.
[02:31:41.429 --> 02:31:47.053]  Everybody's waking up to who you are and what you are and that both parties are bought and paid for by foreign globalist interest.
[02:31:49.595 --> 02:31:51.637]  Wayne Madsen is our guest.
[02:31:54.486 --> 02:31:57.987]  Wayne, do you think Bush will be able to make it out of his term?
[02:31:58.067 --> 02:32:10.131]  Clearly the Democrat establishment circled the wagons with Hillary and Pelosi and they're kind of trying to put the brakes on things, blocking any impeachment, blocking a repeal of Patriot Act or Military Commissions Act or John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[02:32:10.451 --> 02:32:16.913]  Looks like the Democrats are just going to stay in and just keep all the new powers the neocon agenda has given them.
[02:32:17.894 --> 02:32:19.214]  Or is there a way out of this?
[02:32:19.354 --> 02:32:22.015]  Or are things so... I mean, Bush yesterday
[02:32:22.615 --> 02:32:23.175]  We're good to go.
[02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:46.223]  This bulldozer tried to attack the members of the media that were there covering it, the Secret Service.
[02:32:46.704 --> 02:32:52.406]  And the White House staff had to yell to the media to get out of the way, and then Bush laughed about it afterwards.
[02:32:52.446 --> 02:32:53.707]  This guy's a psychopath!
[02:32:53.767 --> 02:32:54.787]  He's a sociopath!
[02:32:55.228 --> 02:33:06.293]  You know, I've said now that we have the 25th Amendment, which talks about the removal of the President for physical or mental incapacity.
[02:33:06.813 --> 02:33:08.754]  And I think people forget about the mental part.
[02:33:08.794 --> 02:33:11.256]  Has he had many strokes or is it the drug abuse?
[02:33:11.436 --> 02:33:18.741]  I think it's fetal alcohol syndrome, the drugs he used, the fact he wasn't too smart anyway.
[02:33:18.801 --> 02:33:22.043]  It's a whole lot of things, but this guy doesn't belong in that.
[02:33:22.083 --> 02:33:27.607]  I was down at the Central Library, and I'm not being mean, I was down at the Central Library doing some research last night.
[02:33:28.267 --> 02:33:34.011]  And you know, that's where the really mentally ill homeless stay, because they shut down the state hospital and built condos here in Austin.
[02:33:34.051 --> 02:33:40.096]  So, there's literally like 20, 30 of them out front, and they're all talking to themselves, saying things to you, gibbering.
[02:33:40.436 --> 02:33:45.480]  And I mean, Bush acts like someone with serious brain damage.
[02:33:46.055 --> 02:33:51.879]  Yeah, I mean, he makes some of them look good, because we have the same situation in Washington with people on the street.
[02:33:51.919 --> 02:34:07.670]  But, you know, this guy, you know, the 25th Amendment says that, you know, if Cheney had a stroke, he was, you know, he just couldn't perform the duties, well, the Cabinet would meet, and if there was a majority of the Cabinet that decided he needed to be replaced, they would replace him.
[02:34:07.690 --> 02:34:09.351]  Now, of course, that gives us Cheney.
[02:34:09.731 --> 02:34:22.260]  But see, if you get rid of Bush under the 25th Amendment for mental incapacity, then of course the people in Congress can take a look at Cheney and try to impeach him!
[02:34:22.731 --> 02:34:46.115]  But, you know, back during Watergate, you know, the three great beards of the Republican Party, Barry Goldwater, who was basically the unofficial leader of the Republicans, the Senator at that time, Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott, and House Minority Leader John Rhodes, after the articles of impeachment were voted against Nixon, they went to the White House and said, look, it's time for you to go!
[02:34:46.556 --> 02:34:47.696]  We can't support you!
[02:34:48.076 --> 02:34:48.896]  And Nixon went.
[02:34:49.814 --> 02:35:03.003]  You know, you could have John Warner and Lugar and all these other Republicans go up to Bush and say, look, you know, if, say there were articles of impeachment, I don't think this guy will do what Nixon did.
[02:35:03.023 --> 02:35:07.626]  This guy, I think, you know, I envisage even when his terms up, the U.S.
[02:35:07.686 --> 02:35:10.568]  Marshals would have to go in there and physically remove this nutcase.
[02:35:11.522 --> 02:35:13.623]  I mean, that's just my gut feeling after seeing him.
[02:35:29.501 --> 02:35:32.485]  I agree with you.
[02:35:32.845 --> 02:35:35.608]  He's deteriorating rapidly.
[02:35:36.229 --> 02:35:39.973]  I remember he used to be somewhat coherent, but we've got a real bad situation.
[02:35:40.253 --> 02:35:42.315]  We've never had this in our history.
[02:35:43.216 --> 02:35:44.478]  It's just a shame that people
[02:35:45.018 --> 02:35:51.541]  Uh, aren't waking up and figuring this guy out, that this guy's not only a danger to our nation, he's a danger to the, to the planet!
[02:35:51.721 --> 02:35:57.964]  And, uh... I mean, Ronald Reagan got shot so he was sick and took naps and stuff, but he could get up and speak well and had ten times the faculty of Bush.
[02:35:57.984 --> 02:36:02.006]  I mean, and I hear neocons on air going, he's so smart, he's so well-spoken.
[02:36:02.286 --> 02:36:03.227]  It's like a joke!
[02:36:03.607 --> 02:36:16.037]  Oh, well, he's good for them because he does exactly what they tell him to do, but this guy, at best, he got a gentleman's C in Yale and Harvard.
[02:36:16.117 --> 02:36:18.079]  And that's with granddaddy and daddy.
[02:36:18.099 --> 02:36:19.640]  Yeah, that's called legacy.
[02:36:19.660 --> 02:36:21.402]  That's being a legacy student, you know?
[02:36:22.703 --> 02:36:28.728]  But anyway, this guy doesn't just... We've got two years left!
[02:36:30.169 --> 02:36:31.330]  Are we going to survive this?
[02:36:31.430 --> 02:36:32.511]  I just don't think we will.
[02:36:32.531 --> 02:36:36.234]  We may end up being like Yeltsin in a wheelchair, just giggling and drooling.
[02:36:36.614 --> 02:36:37.835]  Well, that's right, that's right.
[02:36:38.356 --> 02:36:43.840]  I just think that now we see Republicans starting to wake up and smell Fossey.
[02:36:43.860 --> 02:36:46.622]  Do you think he's back on Columbian Flake and Jack Daniels?
[02:36:46.802 --> 02:36:50.205]  Well, I'll tell you, he's a Jim Beam guy, I understand.
[02:36:50.365 --> 02:36:52.627]  Remember the pretzel incident?
[02:36:52.667 --> 02:36:53.928]  He choked on a pretzel.
[02:36:54.108 --> 02:36:58.372]  I heard way back then, and that was way before 9-11, he had just been president.
[02:36:58.732 --> 02:37:09.636]  For a few months, but that was a heavy imbibement and Jim Beam and beer and he passed out, which I don't think, obviously wasn't the first time.
[02:37:09.656 --> 02:37:13.638]  Have you seen a few months ago when him and Laura got off the helicopter at Crawford and they're both stumbling?
[02:37:14.218 --> 02:37:17.540]  Oh yeah, well, you know, she's got her hands full too.
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:21.941]  I wouldn't blame her if she started drinking, but you know, you have to live with that.
[02:37:22.001 --> 02:37:25.763]  But yeah, no, the country's in bad shape and we have a process.
[02:37:26.984 --> 02:37:28.788]  You know, the 25th Amendment.
[02:37:29.269 --> 02:37:32.174]  You know, if he had a stroke we certainly wouldn't want him in there.
[02:37:32.194 --> 02:37:33.697]  Well, maybe he's just drunk in public.
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:39.302]  Well, somebody's got to step in.
[02:37:39.383 --> 02:37:42.805]  If it's the Republicans and Democrats and the Congress, we'd get together.
[02:37:43.245 --> 02:37:46.727]  But I still just don't think this guy's going to leave willingly.
[02:37:46.787 --> 02:37:48.969]  I just have this vision.
[02:37:48.989 --> 02:38:00.056]  But how is it not a major... I mean, we know the media is bought and paid for by the military-industrial complex, but how can the media ignore the fact that the guy literally is acting like a mentally ill homeless person?
[02:38:00.456 --> 02:38:08.759]  Well, yeah, I mean, because they like their rides on Air Force One, and they get the big jumbo shrimp at the buffets that are set up for the press.
[02:38:09.099 --> 02:38:10.899]  I mean, why would you want to turn that down?
[02:38:10.939 --> 02:38:16.181]  I mean, they're putting their own... And now we know, of course we know out of the Libby trial, we know who they went to.
[02:38:16.221 --> 02:38:24.163]  We have a list provided by the Vice President's office on who their water carriers were, and it was Tim Russert and all the usual suspects from the major media.
[02:38:24.183 --> 02:38:25.584]  These guys don't belong in there.
[02:38:25.604 --> 02:38:28.785]  Well, right now we have memos with Cheney admitting these are their operatives.
[02:38:29.205 --> 02:38:29.665]  Exactly!
[02:38:29.826 --> 02:38:31.247]  Yeah, these guys we go to.
[02:38:31.267 --> 02:38:34.289]  He even says one of them that Meet the Press is the place to go.
[02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:46.378]  I mean, this guy Rusher should be bounced out of there because, you know, how dare, you know, they have him, you know, there used to be great hosts of Meet the Press, you know, Michael Spivak and others.
[02:38:47.018 --> 02:38:50.821]  He doesn't, you know, he shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath with some of those.
[02:38:53.623 --> 02:39:02.970]  I mean, the guy's just a water carrier for this administration, and he and other ones, their names show up on a list.
[02:39:03.030 --> 02:39:15.480]  I mean, I have never seen anything more condemning of the media than that list, because it basically proves what I've said all along, that these guys are functioning as PR people for this White House.
[02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:31.129]  Well, we've got Bush's degenerating and Cheney constantly falling asleep at meetings, looks totally unhealthy, five heart attacks, who knows what else, four cardiologists falling at all times, excuse me, three cardiologists, I mean, this is insane!
[02:39:31.569 --> 02:39:37.533]  Well, it is, you know, and you know, it's just we do, but you know, I get back to the founders of this country,
[02:39:38.213 --> 02:39:45.459]  And the people who amended the Constitution foresaw this type of thing happening, and I just wish people would start looking at that 25th Amendment.
[02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:46.900]  It's there.
[02:39:46.940 --> 02:39:48.121]  It's part of the Constitution.
[02:39:48.301 --> 02:39:49.722]  Last question before we get to the Democrats.
[02:39:50.743 --> 02:39:52.044]  Well, first the Democrats, then calls.
[02:39:53.465 --> 02:39:57.667]  What are Democratic constituents doing seeing the traitorous activities of the Democrats?
[02:39:58.227 --> 02:40:06.050]  Oh, well, I mean, you've got, you know, the problem is with, you know, we've got Hillary Clinton, she's flopping around on the war issue.
[02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:12.732]  I just don't think she's, I think her, they can put her at the top of these polls, but I just don't see her
[02:40:13.392 --> 02:40:17.814]  Uh, as the candidate, unless she, you know, steals, steals the nomination.
[02:40:17.834 --> 02:40:21.716]  Then we got Biden making comments about how Barack Obama's a clean black.
[02:40:22.076 --> 02:40:24.077]  Oh yeah, well, Biden, he's done this before.
[02:40:24.137 --> 02:40:32.201]  In 88, of course, he stole a speech, he plagiarized a speech from Neil Kinnock, the Labour Party leader in Britain, had to drop out of the race then.
[02:40:32.261 --> 02:40:37.704]  I mean, Biden, Biden is, you know, I mean, he, he, you know, he comes from the coal mine area of northern,
[02:40:38.164 --> 02:40:39.425]  Northeastern Pennsylvania.
[02:40:39.465 --> 02:40:45.030]  He's kind of like the kind of guy you'd meet in a bar, you know, after these guys get off their shift in the coal mine.
[02:40:45.090 --> 02:40:47.632]  I mean, he just talks off the top of his head, you know.
[02:40:47.672 --> 02:40:51.496]  I mean, but, you know, is that presidential material?
[02:40:51.556 --> 02:40:51.816]  No.
[02:40:51.876 --> 02:40:54.058]  I mean, look, he's an intelligent guy.
[02:40:54.078 --> 02:40:59.382]  He's certainly not in the same category as Bush, but he shoots his mouth off, says things like clean blacks and stuff like that.
[02:40:59.402 --> 02:40:59.903]  It's terrible.
[02:40:59.923 --> 02:41:00.623]  It's just terrible.
[02:41:00.663 --> 02:41:05.888]  And I think he is probably the most short-lived candidate for the presidency we've seen.
[02:41:06.508 --> 02:41:10.212]  I think even his 88 campaign lasted longer than this one.
[02:41:11.513 --> 02:41:15.958]  Have you noticed how the media is not even mentioning Congressman Ron Paul's run for presidency?
[02:41:15.978 --> 02:41:25.928]  Well, you know, they're not mentioning his and they're not mentioning my guy on the Democratic side, former Senator Mike Revelle, and you're probably interested, Mike Revelle's in favor of the fair tax.
[02:41:26.928 --> 02:41:39.239]  You know, and fortunately he has been invited to the big DNC beauty contest, they call it, this weekend in Washington, so he is starting to get a little bit of attention, but you know, his name is never mentioned.
[02:41:39.279 --> 02:41:42.222]  He's the guy that basically defunded the Vietnam War.
[02:41:42.282 --> 02:41:43.523]  He's been around D.C.
[02:41:43.543 --> 02:41:53.952]  for a long time, and you know, if he could have gotten us out of Vietnam, and he did, he helped immensely to do that, and helped expose the Pentagon Papers to the public, he can get us out of Iraq.
[02:41:55.774 --> 02:41:57.135]  Where do you see Iraq going?
[02:41:57.175 --> 02:41:58.816]  I mean, is it just going to go on forever?
[02:41:58.976 --> 02:42:05.401]  I mean, obviously Bush did the surge, so the Democrats could gripe about that, instead of griping about troop pull-downs.
[02:42:05.761 --> 02:42:15.969]  Well, I guess General Casey, who really took a beating from McCain today, in the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he doesn't see a reason to have as many as 21,000 troops over there now.
[02:42:16.469 --> 02:42:23.635]  Of course, you know, McCain, who was sold out a long time ago, I guess he wants to send whatever troops we have remaining, all of them into Iraq.
[02:42:24.537 --> 02:42:30.764]  But look, there has never been a president who has created such low morale in the military.
[02:42:30.864 --> 02:42:35.408]  One of the groups marching this past Saturday were the military families against the war.
[02:42:35.929 --> 02:42:38.191]  They have people in Iraq now.
[02:42:38.251 --> 02:42:39.293]  Some of them were in Iraq.
[02:42:40.371 --> 02:42:43.213]  They were veterans of Iraq and they just say it is awful.
[02:42:43.273 --> 02:42:53.581]  And I would also mention that recently Stephen Kappas, who was fired by Porter Goss, he was the Deputy Director for Operations of the CIA and he and Goss got into it.
[02:42:53.861 --> 02:42:54.622]  Goss fired him.
[02:42:54.982 --> 02:42:58.244]  Hayden, the new Director of the CIA, went to England to hire him back.
[02:42:58.284 --> 02:43:00.626]  He's now Deputy Director of the CIA.
[02:43:00.926 --> 02:43:03.008]  He told a bunch of former intelligence officers
[02:43:03.288 --> 02:43:11.150]  He said, look, I can't get into it because it's classified, but if you knew the details of what is happening in Iraq, you'd leave this meeting very, very depressed.
[02:43:11.670 --> 02:43:13.550]  I mean, that's from the number two guy in the CIA.
[02:43:13.570 --> 02:43:15.131]  Well, yeah, it's completely lawless.
[02:43:15.271 --> 02:43:19.732]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Jeffrey in Louisiana, then Dave, Shirley, Glenn, and John.
[02:43:20.392 --> 02:43:22.152]  Go ahead, Jeffrey, you're on the air.
[02:43:22.552 --> 02:43:25.173]  All right, I'm going to be brief because I've been waiting two hours.
[02:43:25.513 --> 02:43:32.238]  First of all, the anti-semitic linking by Polizano of you to the anti-semitic side is not new.
[02:43:32.518 --> 02:43:45.227]  There's been a campaign going on for the past month, financed by the usual suspects, with a program on public television linking it to the protocols of the learned elders of Zion and to other documents claiming that Jews drink Arabic's blood.
[02:43:45.927 --> 02:43:54.253]  Number two, I got your information yesterday about the North American Union and the Trans-Texas Corridor on WIST on the
[02:43:55.325 --> 02:43:56.286]  I think so.
[02:44:11.827 --> 02:44:15.748]  We have a bus service that's run by the government between New Orleans and Baton Rouge.
[02:44:15.788 --> 02:44:19.449]  Last week I had to get my clarinet repaired at the stores in Baton Rouge.
[02:44:19.929 --> 02:44:35.752]  When I got to the bus, the buses had no bathrooms and after having gone through that torture, I got to the bus stop at two blocks from the music store and the police had to take me to the store because the crime situation in Baton Rouge is just as horrible as it is in New Orleans.
[02:44:36.405 --> 02:44:43.467]  We've been told this by a lot of people in Red Stick, there in Baton Rouge, that it is just hell on earth.
[02:44:43.947 --> 02:44:46.968]  And this is just the ongoing unraveling.
[02:44:47.148 --> 02:44:59.232]  But going back to the Paula Zahn piece, yeah, the local fake liberal groups, the Ford Foundation fronts, they're all trying to link anybody who talks about 9-11 truth to the minority that is being anti-Semitic.
[02:44:59.872 --> 02:45:01.513]  Wayne Madsen, that's not going to work though.
[02:45:01.553 --> 02:45:02.673]  Isn't that a desperation move?
[02:45:02.913 --> 02:45:04.915]  Yeah, look, they tried that with me, too.
[02:45:05.135 --> 02:45:09.819]  You know, as you say, from the usual APAC, ADL crowd.
[02:45:10.619 --> 02:45:15.443]  And, you know, I mean, just, you know, the only thing you can do is just keep reporting, you know, the truth.
[02:45:15.503 --> 02:45:17.325]  These people aren't going to go anywhere.
[02:45:17.385 --> 02:45:22.509]  They're going to, you know, beat their drums and continue to, you know, what they've done in the past.
[02:45:23.170 --> 02:45:31.216]  You know, many members of Congress have gone up against these people, from Cynthia McKinney more recently, going back to Senator Fulbright.
[02:45:31.357 --> 02:45:31.737]  And, you know,
[02:45:32.157 --> 02:45:39.240]  I mean, you've just got to keep at them, keep at the truth, and they're going to do what they're going to do.
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:41.842]  But they're starting to panic because the propaganda isn't working anymore.
[02:45:41.882 --> 02:45:42.402]  Thanks, Jeffrey.
[02:45:42.802 --> 02:45:44.703]  Let's talk to David in Canada.
[02:45:44.743 --> 02:45:45.863]  Thanks for holding your own here.
[02:45:46.764 --> 02:45:48.004]  Good to talk to you again, Alex.
[02:45:48.445 --> 02:45:55.308]  I just wanted to relay a story about confronting Dr. Roger Gibbons of the Canada West Foundation at a CBC
[02:45:56.107 --> 02:46:02.113]  Lunch and Learn is set up in front of about 800 people and it was quite remarkable.
[02:46:02.353 --> 02:46:07.097]  If you can get your facts out fast enough, they were literally, they look like they've been hit by a two-by-four.
[02:46:07.357 --> 02:46:07.657]  What happened?
[02:46:07.718 --> 02:46:11.361]  And I really think, I know you have a very high percentage of Canadian listeners.
[02:46:11.421 --> 02:46:21.570]  I really encourage anybody who's trying to wake people up to talk about this issue at these kind of forums because I notice in the States if you bring up a question they're not comfortable with,
[02:46:21.994 --> 02:46:22.194]  Thank you.
[02:46:39.153 --> 02:46:54.282]  Alberta's place in Confederation, which in the context of North American Union... Yeah, for those who don't know, we're going into North American Union, it's official, they tried to keep it secret, and you're right, in the free country of America, any question they don't like, you're drug out by mindless police more and more, but up there you can still have an effect.
[02:46:54.802 --> 02:47:03.808]  Up there you can get your point across, up there I think it would have been as harmful for them to haul me out of the room as it would for them to just leave me there, which is what they did.
[02:47:04.412 --> 02:47:12.080]  And I think if more and more people hear about that issue up in Canada, it's going to open their eyes, not only to a lot of the other developments that are going on.
[02:47:12.100 --> 02:47:21.669]  I think Canadians are kind of complacent because they don't believe they're affected by a lot of the stuff that's going on, which is another reason they dismiss a lot of this stuff out of hand.
[02:47:22.270 --> 02:47:28.196]  But we really need to turn up the heat up here, especially because I think if we get a lot of people talking about this issue up here,
[02:47:28.837 --> 02:47:31.818]  It will be a major problem for the political parties up there.
[02:47:31.838 --> 02:47:33.118]  Oh, it is a major problem.
[02:47:33.158 --> 02:47:35.559]  All over the world, people are fighting back against tyranny.
[02:47:35.579 --> 02:47:36.379]  Thank you for the call.
[02:47:36.819 --> 02:47:37.519]  Thank you for holding.
[02:47:37.539 --> 02:47:39.359]  We're going to come back and talk to Shirley, Glenn, and John.
[02:47:39.419 --> 02:47:41.520]  Final calls quickly for our guests.
[02:47:41.620 --> 02:47:43.941]  Wayne Madsen Report dot com.
[02:47:44.341 --> 02:47:46.361]  Wayne, are you seeing the same thing I'm seeing?
[02:47:46.381 --> 02:47:47.781]  Just a huge awakening?
[02:47:48.782 --> 02:47:49.322]  Yeah, I am.
[02:47:50.522 --> 02:47:55.084]  Part of that has to do with finally we're getting Congress to ask some good questions.
[02:47:55.164 --> 02:47:58.425]  I mean, they've been asleep at the wheel for the last six years.
[02:47:58.545 --> 02:48:01.246]  And we're hearing it from both parties.
[02:48:01.326 --> 02:48:04.007]  So will Bush survive in office for another two years?
[02:48:04.107 --> 02:48:07.828]  Well, like I say, I think he's a sociopath.
[02:48:08.008 --> 02:48:10.609]  I don't think he would ever intend to leave office.
[02:48:11.329 --> 02:48:11.750]  On his own.
[02:48:11.770 --> 02:48:21.558]  He'd have to be dragged out of there by maybe federal marshals, FBI agents, you know, whoever else can put him in a straitjacket and put him on the next plane to Crawford.
[02:48:22.959 --> 02:48:24.460]  Out to the cowboy movie set?
[02:48:25.601 --> 02:48:30.805]  Well, look, I always said I wouldn't even have the guy run a french fry station at a McDonald's.
[02:48:30.925 --> 02:48:31.946]  I think he's that stupid.
[02:48:32.146 --> 02:48:37.671]  Well, Bush, Jr., back in like 1990, didn't know what a laser scanner was at a grocery store.
[02:48:38.271 --> 02:48:39.713]  Man's getting upset, too, about the...
[02:48:43.550 --> 02:48:48.980]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:49.361 --> 02:48:56.934]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:57.702 --> 02:49:04.746]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:05.146 --> 02:49:16.552]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:16.892 --> 02:49:20.354]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:20.855 --> 02:49:22.816]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:23.116 --> 02:49:26.958]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:45.192 --> 02:51:49.875]  Welcome back, final segment, final call with Wayne Madsen riding shotgun with us.
[02:51:50.635 --> 02:51:51.416]  Coming up tonight,
[02:51:52.794 --> 02:51:55.377]  UT Ballroom, UT Union Ballroom.
[02:51:55.397 --> 02:51:57.499]  7.30 to a little bit past 10.
[02:51:57.559 --> 02:51:58.320]  We've got until 10.30.
[02:51:59.392 --> 02:52:01.454]  George Humphreys gives a speech, Jack Blood, myself.
[02:52:01.474 --> 02:52:02.715]  We take questions at the end.
[02:52:02.735 --> 02:52:04.256]  I want to see everybody out there.
[02:52:04.276 --> 02:52:05.036]  It's going to be powerful.
[02:52:05.056 --> 02:52:06.057]  There's free parking around there.
[02:52:06.077 --> 02:52:06.658]  A lot of meters.
[02:52:06.678 --> 02:52:10.821]  They're free at night and some parking garages that you can pay to park in.
[02:52:11.201 --> 02:52:11.862]  Plenty of parking.
[02:52:11.882 --> 02:52:12.562]  Hope to see you there.
[02:52:12.582 --> 02:52:15.204]  Details at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:15.684 --> 02:52:16.245]  Come all.
[02:52:16.265 --> 02:52:17.146]  It's going to be a great event.
[02:52:17.186 --> 02:52:18.006]  Beautiful ballroom.
[02:52:18.867 --> 02:52:21.409]  Let's talk to Shirley in Washington State.
[02:52:21.449 --> 02:52:22.249]  You're on the air.
[02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.730]  Go ahead.
[02:52:22.750 --> 02:52:23.851]  Hi, Alex.
[02:52:23.951 --> 02:52:25.052]  Nice to talk to you again.
[02:52:25.392 --> 02:52:28.074]  I have to be really quick because you have only about a minute for me.
[02:52:28.789 --> 02:52:44.542]  There is a group who put together a DVD club and they bought this piece of equipment so they can make 20 DVDs an hour and they wanted you to have this for your listeners.
[02:52:45.924 --> 02:52:47.885]  They have three DVDs available.
[02:52:48.246 --> 02:52:52.249]  The only thing is I have mixed emotions because then you don't get the higher profits.
[02:52:53.254 --> 02:52:57.157]  Yeah, I can't advertise people selling or giving my DVDs away.
[02:52:57.177 --> 02:52:58.598]  Okay, then I'll stop right there.
[02:52:58.638 --> 02:53:00.140]  People all the time, yeah.
[02:53:00.620 --> 02:53:02.221]  Okay, I'll stop right there.
[02:53:02.261 --> 02:53:03.462]  Just give them out in your area.
[02:53:04.023 --> 02:53:09.447]  Okay, I said you're howling, you and Mr. Mattson delivering these lines.
[02:53:11.649 --> 02:53:12.550]  They were so funny.
[02:53:13.150 --> 02:53:15.132]  It's funny until you realize these people run things.
[02:53:15.272 --> 02:53:16.753]  I know, I know.
[02:53:17.074 --> 02:53:21.217]  Rush Limbaugh, we have to get him on lithium carbonate because he's totally bipolar.
[02:53:22.423 --> 02:53:26.686]  And we have to increase GW's Thorazine and Haldol.
[02:53:27.207 --> 02:53:32.850]  My favorite bumper sticker is, um, I want a president that's fluent in at least one language.
[02:53:33.551 --> 02:53:34.592]  We gotta jump, thank you.
[02:53:34.612 --> 02:53:35.913]  Call me back tomorrow, we can talk more.
[02:53:36.293 --> 02:53:37.193]  Wayne, comments to her?
[02:53:37.774 --> 02:53:51.003]  Well, you know, I mean, I agree that, you know, it'd be funny if we were talking about some comedian, but this is the President of the United States, and this guy has his finger on the nuclear trigger, you know, and it just,
[02:53:51.673 --> 02:53:56.215]  You know, it's probably the worst type of nightmare situation we could face.
[02:53:56.315 --> 02:54:01.657]  But at least he's not fluent and charismatic like Hitler or Stalin.
[02:54:02.037 --> 02:54:05.678]  Glenn in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:54:06.378 --> 02:54:08.839]  Oh, hey, it's such an honor to talk to you, Alex.
[02:54:08.939 --> 02:54:13.141]  Boy, I tell you, it's amazing to be on board the ship fighting the New World Order.
[02:54:13.781 --> 02:54:16.202]  I saw you at Cooper Union September 10th.
[02:54:16.282 --> 02:54:18.582]  I managed to get an Investigate 9-1-1 t-shirt.
[02:54:18.602 --> 02:54:19.683]  That was in New York, yeah.
[02:54:20.242 --> 02:54:30.347]  Yeah, let me tell you, I witnessed, I literally couldn't go more than two days into my second year of high school here in Jersey City before I witnessed firsthand the events of 9-11.
[02:54:30.847 --> 02:54:49.357]  I saw them from the window of my high school building, and I ran straight to the fire, didn't wait for orders from headquarters, and I went straight to my high school, and I managed to give a speech to four classrooms detailing points of previous examples of government-sponsored terror, and I managed to get the word out about such important issues as the North American Union,
[02:54:50.070 --> 02:54:57.232]  You know, the operational plan to stage domestic terror against Americans, Operation Northwoods, and I mean, I've aborted the DVDs.
[02:54:57.252 --> 02:54:58.393]  I'm trying to get them out to people.
[02:54:58.413 --> 02:55:02.294]  I'm trying to rush here because it's the end of your show, but you can tell the urgency in my voice.
[02:55:02.894 --> 02:55:09.356]  I witnessed 9-11 firsthand from my high school window, and I wasn't even aware the planes had hit the buildings.
[02:55:09.716 --> 02:55:11.597]  All I witnessed was the demolition.
[02:55:11.717 --> 02:55:13.777]  It was like a special effect out of a movie.
[02:55:14.738 --> 02:55:15.198]  I hear you.
[02:55:15.238 --> 02:55:18.579]  I want to hear more about what you did going back to your old school and doing that before
[02:55:20.073 --> 02:55:21.794]  You know, in the next few days, call us back with that.
[02:55:21.834 --> 02:55:23.095]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:55:23.536 --> 02:55:25.957]  John in Alabama, you're on the air.
[02:55:26.017 --> 02:55:26.918]  Last caller, quickly.
[02:55:27.198 --> 02:55:28.179]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[02:55:28.439 --> 02:55:31.141]  I know this might be old news to you, just want to make sure you know.
[02:55:31.161 --> 02:55:40.247]  Have you heard of the Forte and F-O-R-D-I-O-N packaging company in Hackensack, New Jersey, suing the city of New York for the non-payment of 100,000 body bags?
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:44.180]  No, I haven't heard of that.
[02:55:44.381 --> 02:55:48.682]  Yes, F-O-R-D-I-O-N, Packaging Company of Hackensack, New Jersey.
[02:55:49.063 --> 02:55:52.724]  The lawsuit was filed 7-10-2003.
[02:55:53.324 --> 02:55:56.686]  Judge Hellerstein, H-E-L-L-E-R-S-T-E-I-N.
[02:55:56.726 --> 02:55:57.786]  Tell people why that's important.
[02:55:58.547 --> 02:56:02.448]  It's important because they did something with those 100,000 body bags.
[02:56:02.949 --> 02:56:05.750]  There were more than 3,000 people killed there, that's what.
[02:56:06.414 --> 02:56:06.794]  I hear you.
[02:56:06.814 --> 02:56:07.715]  I appreciate your call.
[02:56:08.015 --> 02:56:09.596]  Wayne Madsen, thank you for joining us.
[02:56:09.636 --> 02:56:10.316]  Thanks for the time.
[02:56:10.556 --> 02:56:11.436]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[02:56:11.957 --> 02:56:12.357]  Take care.
[02:56:12.377 --> 02:56:13.237]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:56:13.537 --> 02:56:16.579]  I'll see you all tonight at the UT Union.
[02:56:16.759 --> 02:56:17.339]  Take care.
