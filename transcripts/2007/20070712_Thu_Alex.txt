[00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:09.936]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:11.376]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:14.077]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:17.338]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:22.019]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.081]  We are scheduled to have Ron Paul on today, but he's on the hill.
[00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:39.098]  He's scheduled to be on in the middle of the next hour, but about half the time when he's on the hill, he either comes on early or late or the next day, so we'll see what happens.
[00:00:39.118 --> 00:00:48.102]  A lot of important questions for the presidential candidate, for the congressman who is now beginning to climb in the polls and is raising a lot of money and getting a lot of attention.
[00:00:48.802 --> 00:00:52.924]  We will be talking to Ron Paul later in the broadcast today.
[00:00:52.944 --> 00:00:58.047]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is already the twelfth day
[00:00:59.148 --> 00:01:06.033]  Of July 2007, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:01:07.494 --> 00:01:18.762]  On the heels of all these War College heads saying we need terror attacks, that is the globalists need terror attacks to continue their New World Order, their neocon operations, to get the people back into submission,
[00:01:19.497 --> 00:01:24.760]  With Santorum, the big neocon, former senator, top neocon, saying the same thing.
[00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:34.186]  Republican minnow saying it, Chertoff saying he feels an attack in his belly, in his little tummy, his little Massad tummy.
[00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:43.011]  With all of this going on, I guess it was about three days ago, I got sent some classified intelligence assessment.
[00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:54.041]  And of course, the FBI always sends this out to the media saying it's classified, so everyone will run around parroting it so they can go, oh, a classified intelligence assessment.
[00:01:55.422 --> 00:01:56.383]  I don't read those.
[00:01:56.503 --> 00:02:03.027]  I erase them when I see the covered letter and see the FBI email address header.
[00:02:03.087 --> 00:02:04.628]  It just is erased out of my email.
[00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:06.229]  You never know if it's a setup.
[00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.271]  Plus, it's disinfo to begin with.
[00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:10.252]  All they feed the FBI is their own disinfo.
[00:02:10.987 --> 00:02:14.529]  I mean, if you want to go get direct propaganda, it's what they feed their agents.
[00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.194]  But I had a sneaking suspicion it's what I'd already seen leaked three days ago in the press, and sure enough, that's what it is.
[00:02:23.638 --> 00:02:27.119]  Associated Press, Al-Qaeda has rebuilt U.S.
[00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:31.441]  intel warns and is just going to attack us any minute.
[00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:41.104]  Remember why the war on Iraq, the war on Afghanistan had severely hurt them and their ability to strike us, and now they are back.
[00:02:41.164 --> 00:02:43.705]  They're going to hit us any minute.
[00:02:44.722 --> 00:02:58.456]  If we don't vote for open borders, and if we don't plunge the dollar even further, and if we don't get rid of every freedom and the red, white, and blue, then Al-Qaeda is just basically going to slit our throats and suck our blood down.
[00:02:58.476 --> 00:03:02.880]  I mean, the Al-Qaeda is everywhere, and they are going to get you.
[00:03:04.452 --> 00:03:25.968]  Meanwhile, it's openly announced by mainstream news in the White House that real Al-Qaeda, real Sunni with real Al-Qaeda, has been attacking Iran for three years, as we've been reporting for three years, now it's mainstream news, and that they are openly attacking Iran all over the West and in central areas of Iran as well, for the, quote, United States.
[00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:30.168]  And it's just announced on the news, like, we're fighting Al Qaeda.
[00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:31.890]  Al Qaeda's about to strike us any minute.
[00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.372]  We have to give up all our rights.
[00:03:33.432 --> 00:03:34.493]  Al Qaeda's about to hit us.
[00:03:34.593 --> 00:03:35.935]  I feel it in my belly.
[00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:36.816]  And then...
[00:03:39.771 --> 00:03:44.275]  Oh, and we're using Al-Qaeda to attack Iran, and Al-Qaeda declares war on Iran.
[00:03:44.335 --> 00:03:45.636]  I mean, those are headlines.
[00:03:46.297 --> 00:03:50.541]  It doesn't get any more ridiculous than in your face.
[00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:55.125]  I mean, we've never been at war with East Asia, we've always been at war with East Asia.
[00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:58.448]  This is up is down, down is up, black is white, white is black.
[00:03:58.468 --> 00:03:59.809]  This is left is right.
[00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.912]  I mean, you can't even get any more insane.
[00:04:03.812 --> 00:04:06.595]  And I keep making the point that we've got a general public,
[00:04:07.418 --> 00:04:12.461]  That doesn't even know where Iraq is, where Iran is, where Pakistan is, Uzbekistan is.
[00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:18.985]  They don't know what Central Asia is, from Middle East, from Southeast Asia, from North Asia, to Northwest Asia.
[00:04:19.065 --> 00:04:20.145]  I mean, they have no idea!
[00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:24.048]  They don't know what the steppes are, Siberia, nothing!
[00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:30.571]  But they got opinions about fighting for America!
[00:04:31.092 --> 00:04:33.313]  You know, and they put that little fake good ol' boy voice on.
[00:04:35.183 --> 00:04:40.444]  And they can sit there and read the newspaper, if they even get around to that, where it says, Al Qaeda declares war on Iran.
[00:04:41.044 --> 00:04:43.285]  Oh, with the five carriers lined up to attack.
[00:04:43.865 --> 00:04:45.645]  Oh, our little buddy declares war too.
[00:04:45.665 --> 00:04:53.167]  I mean, how much more does it take to get you, to get your brain out of malfunction mode?
[00:04:53.607 --> 00:04:57.248]  We're going to get into this and a lot more on the other side.
[00:04:57.268 --> 00:04:58.088]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.046]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.407 --> 00:05:17.995]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.723 --> 00:05:25.786]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.186 --> 00:05:37.611]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:41.473]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.893 --> 00:05:43.814]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.134 --> 00:05:47.996]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.115 --> 00:06:06.200]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:13.587]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:06:13.727 --> 00:06:22.275]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine,
[00:06:22.395 --> 00:06:24.356]  Styrene and MTBE.
[00:06:24.557 --> 00:06:29.120]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.383]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:37.525]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:37.765 --> 00:06:47.432]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:49.053]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach!
[00:06:49.093 --> 00:06:49.274]  Look!
[00:06:49.294 --> 00:06:50.034]  Up there in the sky!
[00:06:50.054 --> 00:06:50.355]  It's Non-X-Man!
[00:06:50.395 --> 00:06:50.835]  He's in a dive!
[00:06:50.875 --> 00:06:52.937]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach!
[00:06:52.977 --> 00:06:53.597]  Let's go look!
[00:07:14.466 --> 00:07:17.649]  I'm Non-X-Man, and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:19.410]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[00:07:19.631 --> 00:07:20.091]  Take them out.
[00:07:20.692 --> 00:07:21.392]  Let's see.
[00:07:21.412 --> 00:07:25.976]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[00:07:26.336 --> 00:07:26.797]  Don't worry.
[00:07:27.257 --> 00:07:28.758]  Now there's Non-X nail gel.
[00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:33.803]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[00:07:34.343 --> 00:07:36.425]  Oh, I will, Non-X-Man.
[00:07:36.545 --> 00:07:39.227]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:44.010]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[00:07:44.491 --> 00:07:47.953]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[00:07:48.473 --> 00:07:59.700]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:06.344]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.704 --> 00:08:08.986]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:12.037 --> 00:08:17.198]  We are scheduled in about an hour and a half to have Congressman Ron Paul on with us from the Hill.
[00:08:17.218 --> 00:08:21.539]  You never know, he could pop up in 20 minutes or in two hours, though, when he's on the Hill.
[00:08:21.559 --> 00:08:22.659]  You never know what's going on with voting.
[00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:37.322]  As the International Crime Syndicate attempts to do everything they can to destroy sovereignty and loot the financial system, what's left of the United States, he valiantly continues his fight on the Hill, looking for him to pop in.
[00:08:38.838 --> 00:08:42.260]  And we were also going to have open phones today for first-time callers.
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.741]  I really want first-time callers today.
[00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:46.942]  You've never been able to get through.
[00:08:46.962 --> 00:08:53.705]  There's been a point you wanted to make on some subject I brought up a month ago, a year ago, two days ago, or today.
[00:08:54.466 --> 00:08:55.666]  You are welcome to call in.
[00:08:55.686 --> 00:08:56.367]  You disagree.
[00:08:56.427 --> 00:08:56.867]  You agree.
[00:08:57.853 --> 00:09:12.256]  Doesn't matter if you're calling from Australia, the land down under, or McMurtle Weather Station in Antarctica, we've gotten a call from before, Japan, or right here in Austin, Tejas, we would love to hear from you.
[00:09:12.296 --> 00:09:16.737]  At 1-800-259-9231 on any of the issues or news stories we've got here in front of us.
[00:09:19.598 --> 00:09:22.399]  We're going to be getting into Al-Qaeda has rebuilt U.S.
[00:09:22.539 --> 00:09:24.199]  Intel Warns, and
[00:09:25.071 --> 00:09:31.995]  Now they say brace for a summer of terror right as the aircraft carriers get in place for the attack on Iran.
[00:09:32.635 --> 00:09:38.198]  Also Cindy Sheehan, big news, says distinct chance of staged terror attack in the U.S.
[00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:41.320]  by the Bush administration and martial law.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.941]  This is a big story.
[00:09:43.842 --> 00:09:51.606]  For our audience, you're fully versed and aware of the executive orders and the PDDs and the Defense Authorization Act and the full
[00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:57.800]  Preparatory phase that we've now exited and now they are locked and loaded.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:03.503]  They have their keys inserted and their launch triggers ready.
[00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:09.066]  They've got the head directly to what's left of America's brain.
[00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:15.988]  The country's been stabbed thousands of times, thousands of cuts, bleeding, in a pile on the floor.
[00:10:16.028 --> 00:10:25.859]  The new order, with pleasure, has its weapon directly to the head of the country, smiling, and the yuppies are running around giggling and snickering while illegal aliens overrun us.
[00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:29.524]  But we're at least here trying to fight for what's left.
[00:10:30.599 --> 00:10:41.286]  Sheehan, Distinct Chance of Staged Attack, Marshall Law, Peace Mom, warns of false flag terror as she prepares to take on Sellout Pelosi.
[00:10:41.746 --> 00:10:46.169]  This is big news because it's a direct challenge to the Democratic apparatchik.
[00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:53.033]  And a lot of people on the left respect Cindy Sheehan and now they're going to learn about false flag terror.
[00:10:53.133 --> 00:10:54.854]  This is her strongest statement yet, by the way.
[00:10:55.772 --> 00:11:15.681]  And they're going to learn about the martial law provisions, because we have our quotes, and we have hyperlinks to the actual legislation, documents, executive orders, PDDs, and of course the enemy combatant designations, as well as the enemy combatant commissions, Military Commissions Act.
[00:11:16.062 --> 00:11:22.965]  So that's all there for you in a blockbuster important story of great import, Sheehan
[00:11:23.883 --> 00:11:25.644]  A singularly important article of the day.
[00:11:25.664 --> 00:11:27.985]  Please get it out to the four corners of the planet.
[00:11:28.145 --> 00:11:32.548]  And they have a new report out saying mixed results in Iraq with the surge.
[00:11:45.726 --> 00:11:48.527]  And boy, does that put new meaning to the word spin.
[00:11:49.047 --> 00:11:51.668]  Republican unity fraying on Iraq war.
[00:11:51.688 --> 00:11:57.291]  Yeah, Republicans know it's political suicide, but you're meant to commit Harry Carey, Republicans.
[00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:03.433]  All powers to be handed over to the liberal wing, which is not liberal at all by any stretch of the imagination.
[00:12:04.353 --> 00:12:08.475]  The hyper New World Order wing of the political system.
[00:12:09.657 --> 00:12:13.081]  Police use helmet cams to record public order and incidents.
[00:12:13.141 --> 00:12:14.263]  New York's had them for years.
[00:12:14.763 --> 00:12:15.744]  Major cities like L.A.
[00:12:15.784 --> 00:12:16.705]  and Dallas are getting them.
[00:12:17.046 --> 00:12:23.633]  But meanwhile, cities across the planet now are trying to restrict you videotaping the police, the little Napoleons.
[00:12:24.655 --> 00:12:28.219]  And New York City's surveillance plan raises privacy concerns.
[00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:31.153]  So, we'll be going over that.
[00:12:31.833 --> 00:12:38.338]  Also, a member of the European Union Parliament from England is calling for banning all sports cars.
[00:12:38.838 --> 00:12:42.741]  He says a sports car is anything that goes over 101 miles per hour.
[00:12:42.781 --> 00:12:43.882]  I have the article right here.
[00:12:45.203 --> 00:12:53.669]  And he says, being a good socialist, that not only is it for the earth, but that it's a, quote, boy toy and a symbol of affluence.
[00:12:55.490 --> 00:13:04.414]  Again, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the elite of the world telling you, you don't need to have any symbols of affluence in your little castle or your little sports car.
[00:13:05.855 --> 00:13:10.117]  I mean, I don't know of any cars that don't go over 100 miles an hour nowadays.
[00:13:12.138 --> 00:13:18.081]  I mean, my wife's got a four-cylinder car that's speedometer goes to 160 miles an hour.
[00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:20.542]  Now, she's never gone above 70.
[00:13:20.582 --> 00:13:22.343]  She's very good, stays at the speed limit.
[00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:37.234]  I did one time out on a country road, north of Fredericksburg, hypothetically, for literary reasons, let's just say I'm saying it that way, did get it up to about 124 miles an hour with the accelerator only halfway down.
[00:13:38.654 --> 00:13:38.934]  Okay?
[00:13:39.594 --> 00:13:50.978]  That's what, car's like four years old now, that's what, I was about two years old then, car was, that's what a Passat, just a, the cheapest Passat you can buy will do, with a four cylinder.
[00:13:52.242 --> 00:14:10.278]  Okay, so it just bans everything basically, and just absolutely incredible, absolutely amazing to see this type of situation.
[00:14:11.579 --> 00:14:12.660]  So we'll be getting into that.
[00:14:14.782 --> 00:14:17.505]  Let me right now just get into this letter I received.
[00:14:20.914 --> 00:14:31.818]  It doesn't say don't use my name, but I'm not going to use his name until it becomes clear that he wants to come on the show or that I'm authorized to read his name on air.
[00:14:34.699 --> 00:14:46.424]  And I've seen similar stories like this in the mainstream media across the country, but I just read this before I went on air, so we're going to try to get Brian, we'll just say that, on air.
[00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:55.992]  Dear Alex, because this illustrates basically everything we're facing here in the police state.
[00:14:56.773 --> 00:14:59.735]  Dear Alex, I want to tell you what happened to me today.
[00:14:59.755 --> 00:15:03.037]  I received this, he emailed this letter July 2nd.
[00:15:03.937 --> 00:15:06.539]  Okay, so this is 10 days ago.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:14.383]  I want to tell you what happened to me today in Austin so that you can warn your listeners.
[00:15:15.764 --> 00:15:20.167]  Yesterday I had a minor fender bender in a parking lot on North Lamar.
[00:15:20.854 --> 00:15:32.107]  I digitally photographed the very minor damage to my car and also photographed the other guy's car just as the insurance company recommended in the brochure that came with my policy.
[00:15:32.968 --> 00:15:34.911]  I've actually read my policy, it actually says that too.
[00:15:35.672 --> 00:15:42.934]  The guy that hit me was a Mexican with no driver's license or insurance that he could provide me for identification.
[00:15:43.354 --> 00:15:52.157]  For this reason, I also photographed him, his license plate, and also photographed the registration sticker and the vehicle inspection sticker on his windshield.
[00:15:52.777 --> 00:16:03.440]  Today, Monday, I went into CVS Pharmacy drugstore located at Breaker and Lamar to print out the photos of my insurance agent to see.
[00:16:04.608 --> 00:16:10.650]  As I was leaving, two Austin police cars pulled up, post-paced, boxed me in so I could not leave.
[00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.291]  They ordered me to spread eagle and search me for weapons and handcuffed me.
[00:16:14.911 --> 00:16:32.377]  I was then accused of digitally photographing the inspection sticker and registration stickers off the Mexican's car for the purpose of cutting them out and putting them on my windshield to avoid the registration and inspection fees of running this scam as a business.
[00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:39.981]  Now I was not in the CVS pharmacy for more than 10 or 15 minutes processing my pictures on the automatic machine.
[00:16:40.381 --> 00:16:45.022]  Apparently the assistant manager at CVS monitors what is being printed on the machines.
[00:16:45.102 --> 00:16:45.543]  Are you kidding?
[00:16:45.563 --> 00:16:47.983]  They get bonus money from the cops.
[00:16:48.464 --> 00:16:53.325]  On the machines and was trained to alert the police for things like this.
[00:16:53.985 --> 00:16:59.547]  What a collusion of private enterprise and the police department.
[00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:04.055]  Of course I was let go after the police realized that they had nothing to hold me on.
[00:17:04.475 --> 00:17:09.840]  But the shock of standing handcuffed in a parking lot, being stared at by countless passers-by for nothing.
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:16.145]  Let your listeners know that there is nothing that goes unnoticed by these proudly owned digital camera processing centers.
[00:17:16.586 --> 00:17:18.347]  Big Brother is indeed watching.
[00:17:18.828 --> 00:17:21.170]  Also, since I am so
[00:17:22.492 --> 00:17:31.945]  Burned up about this, tell them that they can indeed make perfect reproductions of passable inspection stickers and registration stickers using a run-of-the-mill digital camera.
[00:17:32.526 --> 00:17:36.111]  If I cut out my photos of these stickers and pasted them on my window...
[00:17:37.219 --> 00:17:40.722]  You could never, on casual expression, tell the difference for a real one.
[00:17:40.962 --> 00:17:41.963]  But that is not the point.
[00:17:42.003 --> 00:17:45.106]  The point is that Big Brother is more ubiquitous than you might think.
[00:17:46.086 --> 00:17:49.689]  No sir, it's not more than I think, but frankly probably is.
[00:17:49.709 --> 00:17:50.270]  You're probably right.
[00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.871]  It's probably worse than I can even imagine.
[00:17:52.151 --> 00:17:52.812]  It always is.
[00:17:54.964 --> 00:17:59.805]  I've told the story many times of the carpet cleaner in my house.
[00:18:00.305 --> 00:18:01.966]  This has got to be seven years ago.
[00:18:01.986 --> 00:18:03.166]  I think it was 2000.
[00:18:03.906 --> 00:18:04.106]  Yeah, 2000.
[00:18:04.146 --> 00:18:08.767]  I remember there was a newspaper with me on the front cover.
[00:18:09.668 --> 00:18:14.809]  Laying there, it just so happened when he began thinking I was Al Qaeda, so I could go, look, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:18:14.849 --> 00:18:15.629]  Guns are allowed.
[00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:19.010]  See, I'm in the paper defending Second Amendment rights.
[00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:24.231]  And I caught the guy talking to the other assistant carpet cleaner about
[00:18:24.924 --> 00:18:25.424]  We're good to go.
[00:18:49.133 --> 00:18:55.538]  I went on air and talked about it that night, and sure enough, the assistant called in and said, yeah, they ended up firing me.
[00:18:55.598 --> 00:18:59.401]  They did start the procedure of calling police on you.
[00:18:59.421 --> 00:19:01.402]  Of course, I had gotten paranoid later.
[00:19:01.642 --> 00:19:02.683]  I thought, oh, I'm just paranoid.
[00:19:02.703 --> 00:19:07.406]  That was, like, the middle of the day, and then, like, five I called, and they said, no, Mr. Jones, it was discussed.
[00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:08.567]  We didn't call the police on you.
[00:19:08.967 --> 00:19:11.930]  Folks, they think guns are illegal in Texas, okay?
[00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:16.433]  You understand how deep the evil is, okay?
[00:19:17.225 --> 00:19:22.046]  I mean, you got half the public, I guess, in Texas that has guns and knows the history and a little bit about the laws.
[00:19:22.426 --> 00:19:25.507]  The other half watch TV, and most TV shows are set in L.A.
[00:19:25.527 --> 00:19:28.347]  or New York, where they pull people over and go, oh, I got a gun!
[00:19:28.647 --> 00:19:31.568]  Or every episode, the cops go in a house and go, oh, we found a gun!
[00:19:32.548 --> 00:19:42.190]  And these, these, these mindless scum, they... I mean, they're Nazi thugs, man!
[00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:42.930]  That's America!
[00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.551]  Land of the cowards, home of the surveillance thugs!
[00:19:46.391 --> 00:19:49.617]  Home of the tattletales, home of the snitches, home of the cowards!
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:51.901]  Be right back.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.381]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:09.623]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:20:09.863 --> 00:20:14.224]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:20:14.525 --> 00:20:23.428]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:20:23.628 --> 00:20:27.249]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:32.575]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:20:32.876 --> 00:20:39.564]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:20:40.091 --> 00:20:40.732]  What about you?
[00:20:41.392 --> 00:20:46.738]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:20:46.798 --> 00:20:47.879]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:20:47.959 --> 00:20:49.861]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:21:01.943 --> 00:21:05.788]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:21:05.808 --> 00:21:07.070]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.815]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:21:11.095 --> 00:21:13.619]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:21:14.019 --> 00:21:15.781]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:21:16.102 --> 00:21:18.405]  They've both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:21:19.446 --> 00:21:23.188]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:21:23.228 --> 00:21:25.088]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:21:25.128 --> 00:21:26.909]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:39.674]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:21:39.754 --> 00:21:42.716]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[00:21:42.736 --> 00:21:43.436]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:21:43.476 --> 00:21:46.177]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[00:21:46.197 --> 00:21:46.858]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:22:02.122 --> 00:22:04.184]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:04.825 --> 00:22:13.733]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.194 --> 00:22:21.381]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.094 --> 00:22:27.600]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:38.911]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:39.672 --> 00:22:41.694]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:22:45.217 --> 00:22:46.418]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:22:46.438 --> 00:22:55.264]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[00:22:55.284 --> 00:22:56.385]  Supreme Court.
[00:23:11.849 --> 00:23:16.152]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an eye-nothing decision of the U.S.
[00:23:16.193 --> 00:23:19.795]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[00:23:20.796 --> 00:23:26.080]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[00:23:26.841 --> 00:23:35.148]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:40.972 --> 00:23:41.672]  Call now.
[00:23:41.692 --> 00:23:48.756]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:24:15.876 --> 00:24:16.496]  Welcome back.
[00:24:17.677 --> 00:24:35.927]  By the way, if you're driving around in your car with big giant desecrated American flags made in China by slaves, flapping or they're ripping to pieces, and you don't like me calling this country land of the cowards, home of the scum... Look, there's a little bit of this country left, and if we can't admit up,
[00:24:36.658 --> 00:24:39.639]  To how far we've fallen, we're not going to save this nation, okay?
[00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:50.682]  If you keep walking around with your slack-jawed smile on your faces, and I want to just slap off your ugly faces, I'm talking to neocons out there, then this country is going to completely die.
[00:24:50.702 --> 00:24:54.163]  And any future you've got left dies with it.
[00:24:54.903 --> 00:24:55.984]  Let me tell you something.
[00:24:57.544 --> 00:25:03.606]  I can go through all the stories of old ladies I know, and I mention that because these are people that have never seen marijuana.
[00:25:05.951 --> 00:25:24.197]  And of all the college students and all the fitness freaks and all the just even mainline people who've had cops bust in their house without warrants because the neighbor thought they smelled pot or the carpet cleaner saw some orchids under a grow lamp in the back table.
[00:25:25.899 --> 00:25:31.505]  Or because the old lady lived there and the power bill was too big and the cops thought there must be grow lights.
[00:25:31.545 --> 00:25:33.587]  I mean, they scrutinize everything.
[00:25:33.627 --> 00:25:37.470]  I want you to know, we're surveilled, we're watched right here where I live.
[00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.712]  I don't have to go to Dallas where they do it.
[00:25:39.732 --> 00:25:41.494]  I don't have to go to Tucson where they do it.
[00:25:41.514 --> 00:25:42.215]  I don't have to go to L.A.
[00:25:42.235 --> 00:25:43.216]  where they do knock and talk.
[00:25:43.516 --> 00:25:48.301]  They come to doors, I know a bunch of people personally, it's happened to, and they knock on your door.
[00:25:48.965 --> 00:25:52.106]  When you're at work and they ask your wife, hey, we want to come in and search.
[00:25:52.146 --> 00:25:56.367]  And most women get intimidated by guys in these Nazi outfits and they let them in.
[00:25:56.667 --> 00:25:57.547]  Let me tell you something.
[00:25:58.028 --> 00:26:02.489]  Man, that's one step away from hardcore Soviet Union, hardcore Germany.
[00:26:03.449 --> 00:26:07.550]  I mean, folks, when they're at your door wanting to randomly search, you're in deep trouble.
[00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:08.710]  I'm in deep trouble.
[00:26:08.951 --> 00:26:09.891]  I'm freaked out.
[00:26:10.231 --> 00:26:11.871]  I could hardly sleep last night.
[00:26:13.152 --> 00:26:14.892]  And let me tell you, I feel it in my gut.
[00:26:14.912 --> 00:26:16.053]  I've been saying that for months.
[00:26:16.333 --> 00:26:17.653]  And now Chair Top's saying it.
[00:26:18.559 --> 00:26:21.681]  And he feels it in his gut because he full well knows who he works for.
[00:26:22.221 --> 00:26:23.362]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[00:26:24.543 --> 00:26:26.704]  And police, you know that's not America.
[00:26:27.205 --> 00:26:32.088]  Coming to people's doors and saying, I want to randomly search for drugs or guns.
[00:26:32.888 --> 00:26:34.649]  Let me just come in and inspect your house.
[00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:40.033]  You know that's 180 degrees from what this country was founded on and what this country is.
[00:26:41.434 --> 00:26:47.658]  And then on top of it, I know full well that the government ships in and controls the narcotics traffic and the money laundering of it.
[00:26:48.337 --> 00:26:49.458]  And you know it too!
[00:26:51.941 --> 00:26:53.462]  It's been on the cover of Esquire.
[00:26:53.742 --> 00:26:55.004]  It's been everywhere.
[00:26:55.604 --> 00:26:56.925]  It's a well-known fact.
[00:26:58.547 --> 00:26:59.468]  I've had enough!
[00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:02.551]  We're all in danger here!
[00:27:02.891 --> 00:27:06.475]  And I'm not going to just get into the psychology of hating on the police and calling you names.
[00:27:07.035 --> 00:27:08.557]  I do that when I'm not thinking.
[00:27:08.577 --> 00:27:09.578]  That's counterproductive.
[00:27:09.758 --> 00:27:12.621]  Just please have some humanity for this country!
[00:27:13.453 --> 00:27:18.695]  And don't give me your baloney about, well you're just trying to stop crime and you're cutting corners and doing what you have to.
[00:27:19.235 --> 00:27:26.777]  Coming to people's houses and trying to intimidate them into randomly letting you search their house is not freedom.
[00:27:27.498 --> 00:27:40.522]  And having deals with major carpet cleaning and maid services and plumbing outfits to spy when they're in your business or your home and you're paying them and they're spying on you.
[00:27:42.092 --> 00:27:59.483]  I mean, every few days I still see articles where a family goes in completely innocently with a picture of, say, their two-year-old baby, their 15-month-old baby in the bathtub, and the police show up, they take their children, charge them as pedophiles, and their life's over.
[00:28:00.223 --> 00:28:09.189]  But Barney Frank, the congressman, can be caught running a three-story brothel in Maryland with 14-year-old boys, and man, nothing happens to him.
[00:28:10.445 --> 00:28:19.929]  Or the Washington Times in 1987 can have a front page story about underage male prostitutes being brought into the White House and nothing happens.
[00:28:20.489 --> 00:28:28.132]  Or Dinecore and Halliburton can be in the front page of the Chicago Tribune running giant child kidnapping rings and nothing happens.
[00:28:28.852 --> 00:28:34.134]  But you go take photos in of a wreck and somebody's inspection sticker and you're going to get grabbed within minutes.
[00:28:34.435 --> 00:28:35.295]  It's the culture!
[00:28:36.218 --> 00:28:42.884]  A woman can bleed to death in the aisle of a grocery store and nobody helps her but they snap pictures because they've been so dehumanized.
[00:28:44.626 --> 00:28:46.948]  And when you dehumanize somebody else, you become dehumanized.
[00:28:47.028 --> 00:28:53.794]  An Austin cop can bleed to death in a pile of fire ants for 45 minutes and nobody helps him.
[00:28:54.034 --> 00:28:54.254]  See?
[00:28:55.135 --> 00:28:56.697]  We're all hurt by this system.
[00:28:58.278 --> 00:29:01.381]  So conversely, think about that paradox.
[00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:05.732]  People won't help each other, but then they'll go tattle.
[00:29:06.072 --> 00:29:06.653]  Well, you know why?
[00:29:06.673 --> 00:29:07.854]  Because they get money.
[00:29:09.455 --> 00:29:14.940]  They get, in some cases, 25% if it leads to a conviction.
[00:29:16.401 --> 00:29:22.226]  And they got deals with these corporations to get, where the corporation gets a percentage and their tattletale employee gets a percentage.
[00:29:23.107 --> 00:29:24.288]  Now, I've had enough of it.
[00:29:25.529 --> 00:29:26.530]  I've had enough of it!
[00:29:28.777 --> 00:29:35.780]  There's a lot of other worse examples of the tattletailing and the spying that's going on in this society.
[00:29:37.301 --> 00:29:39.923]  But when cops pull illegal aliens over, they're told to let them go!
[00:29:40.723 --> 00:29:45.365]  See, and then there's that whole level of hypocrisy laid over on top of it.
[00:29:45.985 --> 00:29:48.347]  Do any of us want to live in a society like this?
[00:29:52.008 --> 00:29:53.029]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:54.910]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.908 --> 00:29:58.650]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.193 --> 00:30:02.614]  Attention!
[00:30:02.714 --> 00:30:05.536]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[00:30:05.837 --> 00:30:10.140]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.141]  Listen closely.
[00:30:11.802 --> 00:30:19.228]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[00:30:19.528 --> 00:30:28.298]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[00:30:28.618 --> 00:30:34.125]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[00:30:34.445 --> 00:30:43.867]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[00:30:44.067 --> 00:30:49.709]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[00:30:49.889 --> 00:30:53.469]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[00:30:53.689 --> 00:30:57.030]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[00:31:02.757 --> 00:31:03.998]  This is Elizabeth Border.
[00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:05.219]  News alert!
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:09.944]  Twice a month you can now get the Divided Kingdom's brand new newsletter.
[00:31:10.384 --> 00:31:10.965]  Concise?
[00:31:11.245 --> 00:31:11.865]  Hard-hitting?
[00:31:12.226 --> 00:31:15.128]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:16.710]  War in Iran?
[00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.872]  A coming One World Church?
[00:31:19.632 --> 00:31:24.937]  And the first issue has included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.
[00:31:25.457 --> 00:31:32.884]  For a free sample copy of the Divided Kingdom dossier, write to Post Office Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland, 21609.
[00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:41.472]  A yearly subscription is only $50 for a newsletter that comes not once, but twice every month.
[00:31:41.992 --> 00:31:47.558]  Get the spiritual support you need right now for your free sample copy to P.O.
[00:31:47.618 --> 00:31:50.942]  Box 8 Bethlehem, MD 21609.
[00:31:51.403 --> 00:31:56.989]  Once again, for your free copy of the Divided Kingdom Dossier newsletter, write to P.O.
[00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:58.310]  Box 8 Bethlehem, MD 21609.
[00:32:01.457 --> 00:32:05.561]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[00:32:05.801 --> 00:32:10.885]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[00:32:11.186 --> 00:32:15.830]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.132]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[00:32:18.452 --> 00:32:24.297]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[00:32:24.657 --> 00:32:25.438]  And it works.
[00:32:25.858 --> 00:32:27.319]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[00:32:27.699 --> 00:32:28.720]  Now it's your turn.
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.342]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:35.764]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[00:32:36.064 --> 00:32:39.146]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[00:32:39.526 --> 00:32:41.748]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[00:32:41.928 --> 00:32:44.289]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[00:32:44.309 --> 00:32:44.550]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:46.451]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[00:32:53.775 --> 00:32:54.416]  Guaranteed.
[00:32:54.676 --> 00:32:54.916]  Call 1-800-894-5152.
[00:32:54.936 --> 00:32:55.197]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[00:33:15.558 --> 00:33:22.163]  About three months ago I took my family down to the Texas beach for two days
[00:33:44.497 --> 00:33:47.098]  I've been driving down there since I was a child, down to Port Aransas.
[00:33:47.538 --> 00:33:48.899]  Might see one or two state police.
[00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:57.022]  By the time I started counting, from Austin to the coast, 22 state police cars.
[00:33:58.142 --> 00:34:00.403]  Innumerable police cars of other types.
[00:34:01.303 --> 00:34:04.965]  Now, just driving from home to work, I'll see 15 police.
[00:34:05.765 --> 00:34:07.005]  That's a whole other point to this.
[00:34:08.706 --> 00:34:10.767]  There are so many police now,
[00:34:13.786 --> 00:34:18.550]  300,000 14 years ago, over a million, now they're saying they want to double that number.
[00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:24.875]  I mean, you go to New York, folks, you walk down any street, there are cops, and it's like something out of a science fiction nightmare movie.
[00:34:24.895 --> 00:34:28.278]  They're standing there, smug, they might walk over and start poking you.
[00:34:28.978 --> 00:34:34.923]  I mean, it's like, I mean, they want you to know, hey, you're in Nazi Germany, okay?
[00:34:35.984 --> 00:34:36.845]  America's gone.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.703]  Now, they may not even know that's the message they're sending, but they were trained to act like that.
[00:34:42.243 --> 00:34:42.904]  It's a culture.
[00:34:44.625 --> 00:34:45.525]  And they want you to know.
[00:34:46.526 --> 00:34:47.927]  You're not cop, you're little people.
[00:34:49.368 --> 00:34:50.269]  They want you to know.
[00:34:50.669 --> 00:34:51.810]  There's a new America.
[00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.630]  You got it?
[00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:55.172]  And it's a place where foreign banks own and run everything.
[00:34:55.512 --> 00:35:01.076]  It's where the head of the Naval War College gets on C-SPAN and says, we work for foreign corporations in the New World Order.
[00:35:01.696 --> 00:35:02.457]  It's an America
[00:35:03.399 --> 00:35:11.481]  Where Al-Qaeda openly works for the government, and openly attacks Iran, and openly attacks the Serbs, and then the government tells us they're fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:14.562 --> 00:35:15.442]  We're going to go to your calls.
[00:35:15.462 --> 00:35:25.325]  We've got calls from Bangkok, and California, and Waco, Texas, Ohio, Illinois, all over the place.
[00:35:28.885 --> 00:35:30.926]  And we do have Ron Paul coming up in about an hour.
[00:35:32.699 --> 00:35:34.919]  We do have an update from the Ed and Elaine Brown story.
[00:35:34.959 --> 00:35:37.200]  We just talked to Elaine Brown.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.880]  She'll be on in about 30 minutes, for about 10 minutes.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.601]  They do have military aircraft flying over the house, not very low, military jets.
[00:35:45.481 --> 00:35:47.862]  I mean, close enough to throw a rocket.
[00:35:47.882 --> 00:35:48.862]  I mean, the tree's moving.
[00:35:50.482 --> 00:35:59.084]  And for a couple weeks, there's been a plan to have some type of, I guess, benefit concert to bring attention to their plight.
[00:35:59.875 --> 00:36:06.240]  And the fact that the Federal Reserve is a collection agency for the private... The IRS is a collection agency for the private Federal Reserve.
[00:36:08.241 --> 00:36:11.704]  And, uh... I didn't want to create a chilling effect for this one.
[00:36:11.724 --> 00:36:19.310]  I learned about it a week ago that a federal marshal called one of the people up who was organizing it and told them, you don't have a local permit for a party!
[00:36:21.211 --> 00:36:24.093]  Now they're involved in zoning, which by the way they checked, it's not zoned.
[00:36:24.133 --> 00:36:24.814]  It's out in the country.
[00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:30.733]  Uh, so it's just made up and now they're talking about not, police not letting people in to have a benefit concert.
[00:36:31.334 --> 00:36:41.823]  They were smart, they just let it go on and wouldn't, wouldn't try to frustrate that, but whatever, I've told people privately that I didn't see it ending well or going well.
[00:36:42.364 --> 00:36:45.887]  It's almost like a challenge, uh, and I, I want to de-escalate things.
[00:36:46.388 --> 00:36:47.829]  But hey, what do I know, you know?
[00:36:49.133 --> 00:36:56.678]  You know, I've learned that I never really have put on airs, because I have a lot of guests on, a lot of people in the Patriot Movement or 9-11 Truth Movement, who put on airs.
[00:36:57.299 --> 00:36:58.720]  And I always thought a lot of that was just ego.
[00:36:59.978 --> 00:37:17.514]  What I've learned in business and life and just being out amongst people in the business community and in culture and in reading more, that no, no, no, people put on the sardonic mask because then that has people respect them and then tow you around.
[00:37:17.534 --> 00:37:20.656]  Like if you act all official and solemn and quiet.
[00:37:21.577 --> 00:37:24.340]  And, and, and, and, and, oh, you better treat me specially!
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:27.502]  And everyone goes, oh, you better treat you specially!
[00:37:27.963 --> 00:37:28.563]  Who am I?
[00:37:28.643 --> 00:37:29.804]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:37:30.084 --> 00:37:33.067]  But see, I've always detested that and can't stand that.
[00:37:33.107 --> 00:37:34.388]  I mean, I am a regular guy.
[00:37:35.149 --> 00:37:37.371]  I'm thinking more and more I might start lording about.
[00:37:37.931 --> 00:37:39.332]  Only so people will listen to me more.
[00:37:40.073 --> 00:37:42.975]  I'm going, you understand how important I am!
[00:37:43.256 --> 00:37:44.517]  No, I'm being sarcastic now.
[00:37:46.378 --> 00:37:47.399]  I'm being sarcastic.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.461]  I don't know, it's just, it's just that I...
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.101]  You know, what do I know?
[00:37:51.161 --> 00:37:51.821]  You know what I mean?
[00:37:54.343 --> 00:37:59.508]  Every day I get letters and emails and calls and people giving me advice, and a lot of it's really good.
[00:37:59.548 --> 00:38:01.849]  I think I've learned a lot from the audience, frankly.
[00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:07.714]  And I do have a humble view, but I think on a few issues that, uh... But, you know, c'est la vie!
[00:38:07.734 --> 00:38:17.662]  Now, I'm the person that, thanks to you, the listeners of this show, has brought the most attention to what's happening up there and outside Plainfield.
[00:38:20.154 --> 00:38:30.762]  But at the same time, if I don't go along with the ideas of everyone in this movement, then I could instantly become some type of, you know, rogue hobgoblin.
[00:38:31.262 --> 00:38:32.824]  Well, I just have to tell it like it is.
[00:38:33.184 --> 00:38:37.907]  But I mean, I have mixed feelings about having a rally, a concert up there.
[00:38:37.927 --> 00:38:49.456]  I mean, I tend to like it, but at the same time, I just think about the psychology of the feds and everything else, and I'm just really... For me, it's not a spectator issue, and I'm not saying this for other people in this movement,
[00:38:50.723 --> 00:38:53.244]  The truth movement, the freedom movement, whatever you want to call it.
[00:38:54.204 --> 00:38:58.165]  I just think some people at a subconscious level don't realize just how serious this is.
[00:38:59.005 --> 00:39:00.645]  We're not playing at this.
[00:39:00.725 --> 00:39:04.026]  This is not, uh, this is, I mean, this is real!
[00:39:05.127 --> 00:39:06.407]  Alright, alright, I'm already digressing.
[00:39:06.427 --> 00:39:13.609]  We're going to get a wonderful lady, Elaine Brown on, and Randy Weaver's there now, too, to give us a report on the military aircraft flying over.
[00:39:13.989 --> 00:39:18.190]  Elaine wouldn't tell us who her source is, but she's got good sources inside the police department.
[00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:18.930]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:25.305]  Telling her that, you know, that there's people who don't want them to have the event up there.
[00:39:27.506 --> 00:39:33.492]  And again, I don't want to mishandle this and have this turn into some incident that precipitates something.
[00:39:35.253 --> 00:39:38.816]  You know, that's my responsibility here.
[00:39:39.437 --> 00:39:43.120]  With great power comes great responsibility, and each and every one of us has great power.
[00:39:43.638 --> 00:39:45.299]  The new order tells you you don't have power.
[00:39:45.319 --> 00:39:46.519]  They tell you you can't affect change.
[00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:52.161]  No, each and every one of you does have the seed of the universe literally in your heart, in your soul.
[00:39:52.181 --> 00:39:55.002]  Alright, let's go to calls as promised.
[00:39:55.022 --> 00:39:56.322]  Then I'm going to get into Sheehan.
[00:39:58.703 --> 00:40:00.303]  The stink chance of staged attack.
[00:40:00.343 --> 00:40:07.825]  Marshall Law, peace mom, warns of false flag terror as she prepares to take on sell-out Pelosi.
[00:40:10.206 --> 00:40:12.627]  And then the big news, Al Qaeda has rebuilt
[00:40:13.431 --> 00:40:13.711]  U.S.
[00:40:13.791 --> 00:40:14.631]  Intel warns.
[00:40:14.891 --> 00:40:20.113]  I thought they'd... The war in Iraq and the... Oh, now they say we've got to attack Iran.
[00:40:20.213 --> 00:40:21.713]  Iran is supporting Al-Qaeda.
[00:40:21.953 --> 00:40:22.474]  I'm not kidding.
[00:40:22.514 --> 00:40:23.334]  It's in the assessment.
[00:40:24.314 --> 00:40:29.615]  Now understand, just yesterday was the headline that Al-Qaeda declares war on Iran.
[00:40:30.456 --> 00:40:32.396]  And then it came out a month and a half ago now.
[00:40:32.416 --> 00:40:34.137]  I can't believe time's flying that fast.
[00:40:35.157 --> 00:40:36.157]  The year's already half over.
[00:40:36.177 --> 00:40:36.637]  Can you believe that?
[00:40:38.298 --> 00:40:41.979]  There was a bunch of headlines where Bush said, yes, we're funding these
[00:40:43.863 --> 00:40:47.185]  Sunni Wahhabist groups and then the group that the U.S.
[00:40:47.205 --> 00:40:50.846]  government said is openly funding is the admittedly headed by number three of Al-Qaeda.
[00:40:51.747 --> 00:40:53.087]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[00:40:53.187 --> 00:40:55.648]  I know I keep talking about it because I just can't get over it.
[00:40:56.949 --> 00:40:57.949]  Iran must be attacked.
[00:40:57.989 --> 00:40:59.270]  They're shepherding Al-Qaeda.
[00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:02.171]  I mean we've got 50 plus headlines.
[00:41:02.191 --> 00:41:03.632]  I mean I don't know how many.
[00:41:03.832 --> 00:41:04.552]  Probably hundreds.
[00:41:04.792 --> 00:41:05.593]  I mean if I've seen
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:16.128]  I've seen, heard, and read reports every day for the last couple years that Iran is funding Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[00:41:16.148 --> 00:41:17.009]  I mean, we've all heard that.
[00:41:17.769 --> 00:41:21.052]  Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda, Iran, Iran, Al-Qaeda, Iran.
[00:41:21.573 --> 00:41:25.596]  I mean, parroting over and over and over and over again.
[00:41:27.137 --> 00:41:31.621]  And then the White House openly funds the top Al-Qaeda operative in Iraq to attack Iran.
[00:41:31.681 --> 00:41:33.403]  Of course, Ty Hearst reported two years ago
[00:41:34.321 --> 00:41:43.044]  Two plus years ago that they're, yes, using Wahhabi and Saudi Arabian backed terrorists to attack Iran, shoot police, bomb military bases, blow up dams.
[00:41:43.404 --> 00:41:44.405]  I mean, all over the country.
[00:41:44.465 --> 00:41:45.625]  It's war over there.
[00:41:46.105 --> 00:41:49.307]  There's people dying every day under Al-Qaeda attack.
[00:41:50.087 --> 00:41:53.228]  Completely funded and brought right to the border by U.S.
[00:41:53.248 --> 00:41:53.928]  Special Forces.
[00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:03.452]  So, our criminal government is funding Al-Qaeda to attack Iran, their ancestral enemy, because they're Shiites.
[00:42:04.494 --> 00:42:05.835]  Predominantly, that's who runs the government.
[00:42:06.275 --> 00:42:11.917]  And then, simultaneously, the New World Order says Iran is Al-Qaeda and is funding Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:12.138 --> 00:42:14.078]  I mean, that is such an insult to you.
[00:42:14.819 --> 00:42:20.321]  I'm talking to school teachers, firefighters, police officers, anybody listening, doctors, lawyers, all of you.
[00:42:20.621 --> 00:42:25.804]  How dumb do they think you are that they sit there and do that in your face?
[00:42:28.115 --> 00:42:33.338]  I mean, that isn't good, folks, when the lies are that open, that arrogant, that ridiculous.
[00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:39.481]  But again, I've been noticing now in news articles they're putting out stuff that's blatantly ridiculous on purpose.
[00:42:39.862 --> 00:42:41.242]  It's a tactic to set the precedent.
[00:42:41.523 --> 00:42:43.964]  Or claiming they killed Zarqawi more than 12 times.
[00:42:45.185 --> 00:42:46.045]  Or Moussaoui.
[00:42:46.726 --> 00:42:47.986]  Or Mohammed.
[00:42:48.427 --> 00:42:53.609]  I mean, every few days they announce somebody they've killed 3, 4, 5, 6 times.
[00:42:53.629 --> 00:42:56.231]  You've got to go count up how many times they were previously killed.
[00:42:57.179 --> 00:42:59.400]  And then, they never say, oh, we were wrong last time.
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.440]  They say, no, no, no, we killed him this time.
[00:43:03.841 --> 00:43:10.222]  And yeah, we killed Kemal Ali three times, and here's his body, and then, oh, by the way, we just now executed Kemal Ali.
[00:43:11.943 --> 00:43:12.583]  Three years later.
[00:43:13.143 --> 00:43:13.743]  Four years later.
[00:43:15.784 --> 00:43:18.984]  I mean, it's just, oh, here's wax figurines of Saddam's sons.
[00:43:19.765 --> 00:43:22.625]  These are their dead bodies, but, oh, but they're wax representations.
[00:43:22.985 --> 00:43:24.046]  Oh, but they're still alive.
[00:43:24.286 --> 00:43:24.866]  I mean, they just,
[00:43:25.572 --> 00:43:29.135]  They treat you like you have an IQ of about 50.
[00:43:30.556 --> 00:43:30.957]  Literally.
[00:43:32.198 --> 00:43:37.402]  They treat you like you are seriously mentally retarded.
[00:43:38.223 --> 00:43:38.844]  And you know what?
[00:43:39.424 --> 00:43:41.466]  The average American acts like they're mentally retarded.
[00:43:42.047 --> 00:43:44.188]  I mean, I'll just tell you flat out, I'm not that smart.
[00:43:44.409 --> 00:43:46.070]  Let me make this clear, that's why I'm so freaked out.
[00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:48.072]  I'm not that smart, folks!
[00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:51.535]  But I know how to go read what Dick Cheney says he's gonna do.
[00:43:54.608 --> 00:44:02.252]  And I'm freaked out that Dick Cheney would say we need to use the media to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:44:04.253 --> 00:44:05.334]  I mean, that freaks me out.
[00:44:06.314 --> 00:44:19.822]  When the Vice President, who can launch nuclear weapons and biological weapons, and they got stuff that'll kill you folks and it is so deadly and has 100% kill rates, and this guy is talking about how they want to do it.
[00:44:20.862 --> 00:44:22.083]  I mean, we got a problem.
[00:44:22.811 --> 00:44:25.533]  If you're not hitting your knees at 3 a.m.
[00:44:25.693 --> 00:44:30.496]  shaking, folks, for your family's future, your head is screwed on backwards, okay?
[00:44:30.857 --> 00:44:41.124]  Let me tell you, this is, this is, this is so incredible, everything is so incredible, that I don't even have words to describe it to you, okay?
[00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:51.831]  And I watch the decadent American people, I watch the people of the world who can't get their heads screwed on straight,
[00:44:53.298 --> 00:44:55.840]  I get mad at myself because I don't work hard enough in this fight.
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:56.801]  This is so serious.
[00:44:57.902 --> 00:44:59.263]  I don't take things seriously enough.
[00:44:59.283 --> 00:45:04.987]  I mean, I'm embarrassed that I spend time fiddling with my mortgage.
[00:45:05.828 --> 00:45:06.748]  And frankly, I don't.
[00:45:06.889 --> 00:45:08.950]  And then I end up not doing well financially.
[00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:15.775]  I mean, I almost get embarrassed when I get on the phone to sell some advertiser because I think, oh my God, I'll just be fighting the new old order.
[00:45:16.016 --> 00:45:21.740]  But then I go, wait a minute, I've got to go spend my time raising money so I can pay for all these servers and all these employees.
[00:45:22.378 --> 00:45:23.858]  But still, I'm still guilty doing it.
[00:45:26.099 --> 00:45:27.880]  Because, I mean, we're right up to the edge, folks.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:31.121]  We're right up to the... just... one second to midnight.
[00:45:31.901 --> 00:45:33.041]  I mean, we're here, folks!
[00:45:33.281 --> 00:45:46.346]  Total psychopathic killers, running everything, brainwashing the public, torture all over television to condition you, FEMA camps being built, overrun by illegal aliens, cops everywhere, cameras everywhere.
[00:45:46.366 --> 00:45:49.226]  Alright, let's take calls as promised.
[00:45:49.286 --> 00:45:49.827]  I'm gonna shut up.
[00:45:50.107 --> 00:45:50.887]  Who's up first here?
[00:45:53.627 --> 00:45:55.728]  Rusty in Thailand, Bangkok.
[00:45:55.848 --> 00:45:56.909]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:45:57.669 --> 00:45:58.990]  Hey, nice to meet you, Mr. Jones.
[00:45:59.330 --> 00:45:59.870]  Nice to talk to you.
[00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:00.451]  What's on your mind?
[00:46:01.231 --> 00:46:03.012]  Well, let me make this brief.
[00:46:03.032 --> 00:46:04.052]  I want to ask you a question.
[00:46:04.193 --> 00:46:07.374]  I want a legal opinion for many of your friends or colleagues.
[00:46:07.674 --> 00:46:14.538]  If this Elaine Brown and Mr. Brown, Ed Brown, is guilty of an offense, and they've got a warrant,
[00:46:15.552 --> 00:46:17.593]  I don't understand how come they haven't been arrested?
[00:46:17.814 --> 00:46:23.597]  If it's a legal warrant, or are they worried about testing the tax president in an open forum?
[00:46:23.677 --> 00:46:34.764]  If a little old lady in Compton, they suspect she's got marijuana, or someone in Tennessee has an unregistered firearm, there'd be SWAT teams there in five minutes.
[00:46:35.205 --> 00:46:35.765]  Am I correct?
[00:46:36.946 --> 00:46:38.207]  I agree with what you're saying.
[00:46:38.247 --> 00:46:41.349]  Look, this is why they haven't gone in and killed the Browns, thank God.
[00:46:41.689 --> 00:46:43.810]  It's because, number one, they don't want to make a martyr.
[00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:44.951]  Same reason they haven't killed me yet.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.483]  Number two, there are good people in what you'd call law enforcement.
[00:46:49.784 --> 00:46:51.625]  I talked to them many times.
[00:46:52.366 --> 00:47:01.153]  I mean, I remember one time I walked into a steakhouse for my buddy's wife's 40th birthday, and there's all these federal marshals there.
[00:47:02.214 --> 00:47:04.076]  And they go, hey Alex, how you doing buddy?
[00:47:04.096 --> 00:47:04.936]  Hey man, what's going on?
[00:47:05.196 --> 00:47:06.357]  Hey, loved your show today.
[00:47:06.397 --> 00:47:08.980]  I mean, they weren't full of bull.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.261]  They really were fans of the show.
[00:47:10.781 --> 00:47:11.662]  And I said, what's going on?
[00:47:11.682 --> 00:47:14.084]  They're like, I can't tell you who's in there, but please don't.
[00:47:14.839 --> 00:47:16.020]  I heard that you're with military in Asia.
[00:47:41.138 --> 00:47:41.698]  We're good to go.
[00:48:01.283 --> 00:48:04.726]  They always tell me there's like a real heavy Cold War going on.
[00:48:04.746 --> 00:48:05.146]  No, there is.
[00:48:05.166 --> 00:48:07.087]  There's a huge split and we're winning.
[00:48:07.328 --> 00:48:13.312]  And I don't like to talk about that on air because I don't like to... I met CIA guys.
[00:48:13.392 --> 00:48:15.694]  What I do, I run a hedge fund, a private equity company here.
[00:48:16.254 --> 00:48:20.617]  I run it in Thailand because you can own your company at 100% and you've got a lot of tax breaks and so forth.
[00:48:20.718 --> 00:48:21.658]  Well, that's what I do.
[00:48:21.738 --> 00:48:22.199]  No, I know.
[00:48:22.279 --> 00:48:23.440]  I meet a lot of these guys.
[00:48:24.841 --> 00:48:28.503]  The special contractors, they're over in Iraq coming over here for R&R.
[00:48:29.304 --> 00:48:30.565]  And a lot of high-level people.
[00:48:31.101 --> 00:48:35.202]  And they're telling me there's a cold war going on right now within the government that people wouldn't believe.
[00:48:35.222 --> 00:48:36.862]  A battle royale.
[00:48:38.162 --> 00:48:39.263]  Well, that's because they're being told.
[00:48:39.343 --> 00:48:40.723]  Men, we're getting ready for martial law.
[00:48:40.763 --> 00:48:41.423]  Here are the camps.
[00:48:41.443 --> 00:48:42.243]  Here's what you do.
[00:48:42.263 --> 00:48:43.283]  And they're going, are you kidding?
[00:48:44.083 --> 00:48:44.964]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:45.144 --> 00:48:56.806]  And I mean, I do talk about it, but the reason I don't get a lot into that is because I don't want to rely and count completely on the government and hope, like with Hitler, you know, somebody goes after him.
[00:48:56.906 --> 00:48:57.906]  We have to stand up.
[00:48:58.619 --> 00:49:06.601]  Okay, and yes, there is a huge, and that's what I started alluding to, a huge fight going on at every level of government.
[00:49:07.301 --> 00:49:07.741]  Big time.
[00:49:08.001 --> 00:49:10.703]  And I want to ask you one brief question, because I know you've got other people on.
[00:49:11.264 --> 00:49:12.464]  You mention a lot of things.
[00:49:12.484 --> 00:49:14.005]  This is the only thing I'm upset at you.
[00:49:14.446 --> 00:49:15.406]  You mention a lot of things.
[00:49:15.426 --> 00:49:18.768]  You pick on everybody, and I really respect that, because you're unbiased.
[00:49:18.788 --> 00:49:20.189]  You're what I call a critical thinker.
[00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:29.795]  But you don't deal with the role of Christianity, and what I like to call, I'm an old philosophy major, the potential deconstruction of Christianity, because I think what the movement has is faith.
[00:49:31.388 --> 00:49:33.670]  Their last straw, they're going to take our faith away.
[00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:39.595]  They're going to take a lot of Christians, a lot of religious people in America, faith away, not by destroying Christianity.
[00:49:39.615 --> 00:49:42.117]  Potentially, they may tell some dirty, hidden truths.
[00:49:43.178 --> 00:49:51.325]  Well, what happens is, they've taken Christianity over, and then they expose what they themselves have done with the World Council of Churches to it.
[00:49:51.965 --> 00:49:57.570]  And so, first they create a false Christianity, then they deconstruct the straw man they built.
[00:49:58.519 --> 00:50:02.941]  And when I was telling one of my friends, we had a discussion about this.
[00:50:03.141 --> 00:50:08.663]  I've got a big nice house here, so we have a bunch of people over, local, foreigners, and we discuss issues.
[00:50:08.683 --> 00:50:10.403]  A lot of Arabs actually love you.
[00:50:10.823 --> 00:50:15.265]  Lebanese that's working here, they actually love you because you're actually objective and you tell the truth.
[00:50:15.665 --> 00:50:18.306]  And one thing I brought up is, what if they tell the truth?
[00:50:18.626 --> 00:50:23.288]  What if a Christian, what if you found out Jesus never really died on the cross?
[00:50:23.828 --> 00:50:26.649]  What if you found out that maybe
[00:50:27.458 --> 00:50:30.059]  He didn't die in, let's say, Jerusalem.
[00:50:30.079 --> 00:50:32.060]  Maybe he went to Africa or India.
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.420]  What if they have evidence in their wake?
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.181]  Well, you can't trust that evidence, and see, that's the problem.
[00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:43.523]  They tried that with that tomb business, remember, four or five months ago, but that backfired and they pulled the show because it was disinfo.
[00:50:43.583 --> 00:50:48.945]  Listen, I really appreciate your call, and tell everybody there in Bangkok, I said hi, keep spreading the word.
[00:50:49.205 --> 00:50:50.786]  Call back again, you're a good caller.
[00:50:51.206 --> 00:50:56.728]  Okay, we're going to come back, jam in some more calls, continue, and then get an update from Ed and Elaine Brown on the military aircraft.
[00:50:57.475 --> 00:51:05.239]  It's here!
[00:51:05.479 --> 00:51:10.261]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.621 --> 00:51:18.245]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.965 --> 00:51:26.008]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.408 --> 00:51:37.833]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.153 --> 00:51:41.815]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.095 --> 00:51:44.076]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.376 --> 00:51:48.238]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:03.354 --> 00:52:07.837]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:52:08.177 --> 00:52:12.279]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:52:12.559 --> 00:52:13.120]  We listened.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:18.402]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:52:18.683 --> 00:52:19.163]  We listened.
[00:52:19.543 --> 00:52:22.585]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:52:23.006 --> 00:52:23.546]  We listened.
[00:52:24.006 --> 00:52:28.089]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.930]  We listened.
[00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:34.534]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:52:34.934 --> 00:52:36.295]  Again, we listened.
[00:52:36.676 --> 00:52:38.237]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:52:38.417 --> 00:52:43.981]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:52:44.441 --> 00:52:47.065]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[00:52:47.286 --> 00:52:47.486]  Only $279.
[00:52:47.546 --> 00:52:48.127]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[00:52:48.167 --> 00:52:48.408]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:52:48.468 --> 00:52:50.090]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:51.072]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:06.668]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:53:06.908 --> 00:53:08.669]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:53:08.929 --> 00:53:15.213]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:53:15.513 --> 00:53:21.636]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:53:21.876 --> 00:53:23.737]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[00:53:23.997 --> 00:53:24.417]  I think so.
[00:53:46.491 --> 00:53:47.011]  This is the end
[00:54:16.297 --> 00:54:31.524]  This is the end, my only friend, the end of all in every class, the end of everything.
[00:54:35.308 --> 00:54:35.989]  No safety!
[00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:38.330]  You'll never look!
[00:54:55.861 --> 00:54:57.742]  I'll tell you why.
[00:54:59.402 --> 00:55:00.663]  They haven't gone in against the Browns.
[00:55:00.683 --> 00:55:07.884]  They don't want to make them martyrs and make tens of millions more look at the fact that the IRS is a collection agency for our private owners.
[00:55:09.305 --> 00:55:13.366]  By the way, it's in the big newspapers, Financial Times of London, that we're owned by foreign banks.
[00:55:13.386 --> 00:55:14.186]  They run the whole country.
[00:55:15.506 --> 00:55:16.967]  Now they don't even need us anymore.
[00:55:16.987 --> 00:55:18.287]  They don't even need free market anymore.
[00:55:19.145 --> 00:55:21.467]  They're in the final mop-up phases.
[00:55:22.047 --> 00:55:27.611]  But we were taken over and bought off by fraud, so it's all illegitimate.
[00:55:28.031 --> 00:55:36.437]  Like Ron Paul has said, he has great policies, well-researched by top economists, mainly of the Austrian school, who know how to get us out of this crisis.
[00:55:36.577 --> 00:55:37.358]  He has a plan.
[00:55:38.819 --> 00:55:41.540]  Monetary plan, and we need to implement that.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:42.921]  He has a plan for health care as well.
[00:55:43.582 --> 00:55:45.403]  And they're all very well thought out, and I agree with it 110%.
[00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:50.232]  Ron Paul is a true scholar, a true statesman, a true patriot.
[00:55:52.094 --> 00:55:56.137]  We got Christy, and Ernie, and Ted, and many others holding.
[00:55:56.157 --> 00:55:59.019]  Let's go to Rob in Dubai, because he's on his own dime.
[00:55:59.059 --> 00:56:00.480]  Dubai, over in the Middle East.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:01.120]  Go ahead.
[00:56:02.822 --> 00:56:03.882]  Alex, am I on the air?
[00:56:04.063 --> 00:56:04.563]  Yes, you are.
[00:56:05.944 --> 00:56:06.184]  Great.
[00:56:06.264 --> 00:56:06.745]  Okay, Alex.
[00:56:06.885 --> 00:56:07.625]  I'm in Dubai.
[00:56:07.665 --> 00:56:11.948]  I'm Irish myself, and the reason I'm calling is two things, basically.
[00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:16.472]  The first one is I work as a headhunter in the petrochemicals industry, and I can tell you now,
[00:56:17.225 --> 00:56:19.086]  There's a reason for this point.
[00:56:19.686 --> 00:56:34.033]  That right now, in Saudi Arabia, they are building massive petrochemical plants for value-added production using an oil and natural gas as a feedstock to make glues and solvents and ethylene and other products like that.
[00:56:34.053 --> 00:56:36.914]  Yeah, they're building up their chemical industry instead of it being in Houston.
[00:56:38.275 --> 00:56:41.236]  Exactly, because a lot of the resource has been used up in Houston.
[00:56:41.496 --> 00:56:45.098]  The result of that is that last year, in 2006, there was an 8% decrease in oil
[00:56:47.543 --> 00:56:51.907]  Uh, exports from Saudi Arabia, which means that I don't believe it's disinformation.
[00:56:51.947 --> 00:56:52.988]  We are at peak oil.
[00:56:53.768 --> 00:56:57.932]  And oil is gonna go to $100, $120, $130 a barrel.
[00:56:57.992 --> 00:57:02.816]  But wait a minute, Saudi Arabia openly cut production to artificially inflate prices.
[00:57:02.856 --> 00:57:03.577]  That was their announcement.
[00:57:04.628 --> 00:57:18.436]  Well, the thing is, Alex, there is dispute over this point over whether or not we are going to see an explosion in oil prices, and I will say that... Well, we know they want to rape us, and we know that they've devalued the dollars, so oil prices are going to go up to $4 a gallon.
[00:57:18.496 --> 00:57:25.000]  We could debate whether or not it's the resource itself that is being used up, or whether... Yeah, what we know is they're going to make it more scarce.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:25.520]  I agree with you.
[00:57:26.397 --> 00:57:27.038]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:27.398 --> 00:57:37.489]  So, I think when you look at the fact that major people in the oil industry are running the government of the United States at the moment, they know that one way or another there's going to be a great decrease in access to oil.
[00:57:37.629 --> 00:57:41.674]  And every major oil company is now evacuating the U.S.
[00:57:41.974 --> 00:57:43.836]  Halliburton has now moved to Dubai, as you know.
[00:57:45.117 --> 00:57:48.341]  Exactly, and I think that they realize that there's going to be a great
[00:57:49.134 --> 00:58:04.490]  Uh, amount of difficulty for ordinary people in the United States in living their lives the way that they live them now, based on, you know, movement around suburbs, and, uh, access to food in supermarkets, and all that sort of stuff, because that's all dependent on oil for just-in-time deliveries to New York.
[00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:05.971]  Now, they've got a special treat!
[00:58:06.271 --> 00:58:07.493]  Special, so keep laughing!
[00:58:07.793 --> 00:58:12.618]  All the corrupt government people and cops who love the system, you're gonna really get to love it soon!
[00:58:13.869 --> 00:58:14.590]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:19.393]  So I actually think that your prognosis, I listened to you earlier on, you seem very alarmed about the future.
[00:58:19.433 --> 00:58:26.717]  I think when you factor in the X factor over decreases in oil and increase in the power of the state, I think we're looking at tough times.
[00:58:27.157 --> 00:58:27.958]  So that's the negative.
[00:58:28.198 --> 00:58:28.978]  I've got a positive.
[00:58:28.999 --> 00:58:29.559]  Well, stay there.
[00:58:29.579 --> 00:58:29.859]  Stay there.
[00:58:29.879 --> 00:58:32.261]  Then we're going to get Elaine Brown on and everybody else's calls.
[00:58:33.621 --> 00:58:36.003]  Yeah, I mean, they're not playing around, folks.
[00:58:36.043 --> 00:58:36.783]  We're in deep trouble.
[00:58:36.983 --> 00:58:37.684]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.425 --> 00:58:46.007]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.027 --> 00:58:46.187]  Hello!
[00:58:58.072 --> 00:58:58.712]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.392 --> 00:59:00.433]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.153 --> 00:59:02.253]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.913 --> 00:59:03.733]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.493 --> 00:59:05.373]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.393 --> 00:59:09.674]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.234 --> 00:59:14.335]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.415 --> 00:59:16.596]  We had a headhunter.
[00:59:16.616 --> 00:59:18.836]  People don't know what that is.
[00:59:19.496 --> 00:59:22.837]  Somebody out looking for personnel, stealing from one company to the other.
[00:59:26.471 --> 00:59:27.912]  He gave us the bad news on oil.
[00:59:27.932 --> 00:59:29.133]  He was going to give us the good news.
[00:59:29.694 --> 00:59:31.335]  He was giving us pretty interesting information.
[00:59:31.355 --> 00:59:33.457]  I guess he thought that I was letting him go.
[00:59:33.497 --> 00:59:33.958]  He hung up.
[00:59:34.498 --> 00:59:35.959]  Rob, if you can call back in.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.101]  It is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:38.161 --> 00:59:39.963]  I know the phones are loaded.
[00:59:39.983 --> 00:59:43.325]  But I want to hear your good point.
[00:59:43.345 --> 00:59:44.106]  We didn't hang up on you.
[00:59:44.126 --> 00:59:44.807]  You disconnected.
[00:59:45.147 --> 00:59:46.768]  Or maybe your phone line went down.
[00:59:46.788 --> 00:59:48.890]  Do we have Elaine Brown yet?
[00:59:51.693 --> 00:59:52.113]  There, John.
[00:59:54.128 --> 00:59:54.949]  All right.
[00:59:55.449 --> 00:59:58.171]  There has been some new developments with the Ed and Elaine Brown case.
[01:00:01.653 --> 01:00:02.574]  John, are you there?
[01:00:04.215 --> 01:00:04.475]  Okay.
[01:00:05.355 --> 01:00:09.878]  John's got a short on his microphone, so I'm unable to communicate to the network, but that's okay.
[01:00:10.198 --> 01:00:12.520]  It takes problems like this to get a new mic up there or whatever.
[01:00:13.681 --> 01:00:15.982]  Do we have Elaine Brown yet?
[01:00:17.463 --> 01:00:18.204]  I can't hear you.
[01:00:18.344 --> 01:00:18.584]  Okay.
[01:00:18.984 --> 01:00:19.344]  That's fine.
[01:00:19.364 --> 01:00:22.186]  We'll go to break and figure out things at the end of that and see what happens.
[01:00:25.174 --> 01:00:27.454]  Well, we're going to go ahead and go back to your calls now.
[01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:29.495]  Let's go to Christy in California.
[01:00:29.515 --> 01:00:30.135]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:31.935 --> 01:00:32.476]  Hi, Alex.
[01:00:32.756 --> 01:00:33.456]  Hi, how you doing?
[01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:34.156]  Good.
[01:00:34.296 --> 01:00:52.280]  I'm a civilian federal employee here, and we're all required to take certain mandatory training courses online, and one of those is a very slickly packaged course put out by the DOD on the Constitution, and I was really ticked off when I did that course.
[01:00:54.122 --> 01:01:06.327]  Let me guess, it taught you that regulations were above it, and that it was quaint, or did they just represent that the Constitution says that we can basically rule everyone?
[01:01:06.387 --> 01:01:06.848]  Go ahead.
[01:01:07.388 --> 01:01:18.853]  Yeah, basically rule everyone, but one particular section was on federal income taxes, and it said that the federal income tax is authorized
[01:01:19.266 --> 01:01:24.030]  By the Constitution, and therefore we must all pay federal income tax.
[01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:25.832]  Of course, the Constitution says the opposite.
[01:01:25.852 --> 01:01:27.653]  It directly says no income tax.
[01:01:28.434 --> 01:01:29.055]  Absolutely.
[01:01:29.175 --> 01:01:43.367]  The other part that really ticked me off was it said that during times of national emergency and times of war, that freedom of speech and the freedom to assemble can be limited or suspended altogether.
[01:01:44.139 --> 01:01:45.600]  Which is not true.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.541]  It is only during invasion, not war.
[01:01:49.081 --> 01:01:51.162]  It is only under invasion.
[01:01:51.682 --> 01:02:05.027]  And then that is extremely limited, and then the Congress and the states have a right to revolt under Article 10, enshrined in the New Hampshire Constitution, but also enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights Constitution, Tenth Amendment.
[01:02:05.688 --> 01:02:06.268]  Exactly.
[01:02:06.408 --> 01:02:11.490]  So, you know, they're putting out this propaganda to all these, you know, civilian federal employees.
[01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:13.831]  So in order for me to counter that,
[01:02:14.671 --> 01:02:19.833]  I've been distributing Freedom to Fascism, Terror Storm, whatever I can get my hands on.
[01:02:19.853 --> 01:02:21.553]  Good job.
[01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:24.314]  But, you know, most people, they don't know.
[01:02:24.854 --> 01:02:27.875]  Whatever the federal government tells them, they believe it.
[01:02:30.536 --> 01:02:31.997]  Well, that's a dangerous world.
[01:02:32.057 --> 01:02:37.639]  I mean, they tell them that Iran is Al-Qaeda, but then Al-Qaeda is fighting for America at the same time.
[01:02:37.719 --> 01:02:38.559]  At the same time.
[01:02:38.999 --> 01:02:41.060]  I mean, I don't know how people can't figure that out.
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:41.840]  I mean, that's incredible.
[01:02:42.788 --> 01:02:44.430]  I don't know.
[01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:48.496]  I saw George Bush this morning during his press conference.
[01:02:48.896 --> 01:03:00.852]  He actually had the nerve to say that the reason we're in the quagmire we're in right now, in Iraq, is because it was Saddam Hussein's decision.
[01:03:02.739 --> 01:03:03.039]  Oh, I know.
[01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:13.724]  It's all Saddam's fault that our government hired him when he was 18 years old and 57, trained him, put him in his bath head of security, because they kept killing the bath head leaders, led by Saddam, as an assassin.
[01:03:13.764 --> 01:03:16.885]  They said, put him in his head of security, 69, we'll leave you alone.
[01:03:17.225 --> 01:03:23.648]  Ten years later, 79, they staged a coup, put him in, they gave him the chemical weapons to spray the Iranians, everything.
[01:03:24.248 --> 01:03:25.349]  That's all I want to add, thank you.
[01:03:54.722 --> 01:04:03.806]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:04:04.046 --> 01:04:15.270]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:04:15.611 --> 01:04:21.313]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:04:21.553 --> 01:04:28.219]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:04:28.439 --> 01:04:35.266]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:04:35.526 --> 01:04:37.308]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[01:04:37.548 --> 01:04:39.770]  Upgrade to Black Berkey Purification Elements Kit.

[01:04:42.234 --> 01:04:42.594]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:04:42.614 --> 01:04:43.996]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:04:56.628 --> 01:04:59.834]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:05:00.154 --> 01:05:02.078]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:02.458 --> 01:05:10.111]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.791 --> 01:05:17.834]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:18.234 --> 01:05:29.639]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.979 --> 01:05:33.901]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.941 --> 01:05:35.922]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:36.202 --> 01:05:40.044]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.753 --> 01:05:55.554]  Government is best which governs least.
[01:05:55.634 --> 01:05:56.895]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:05:57.115 --> 01:05:59.957]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:06:00.317 --> 01:06:03.039]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:06:03.604 --> 01:06:10.349]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:06:10.889 --> 01:06:18.555]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers from humorous to serious at LibertyStickers.com
[01:06:19.535 --> 01:06:19.936]  I think so.

[01:06:34.572 --> 01:06:34.952]  That's 877-873-9626.

[01:06:37.253 --> 01:06:37.913]  Call 877-873-9626.
[01:06:37.933 --> 01:06:38.193]  That's 877-873-9626.
[01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.721]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:57.321 --> 01:07:00.182]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:11.305 --> 01:07:17.527]  Alright, Ted Anderson, the head of the Genesis Network, had the idea, and I think it's an interesting idea.
[01:07:18.565 --> 01:07:24.290]  I'm just worried about what the police would do, and sure enough they're behaving in strange fashions.
[01:07:24.311 --> 01:07:37.963]  I wanted to have like a concert to bring attention to the Federal Reserve, the IRS, and the Browns' plight a few weeks ago, and some folks are going up there with poker face and Dave
[01:07:41.671 --> 01:07:52.579]  I mean, Von Kleist is going up there, Jack Blood, others, and Terry Melton's up there, a local awesome camera guy, freelancer, done a lot of work for us, and he's on the line there.
[01:07:52.619 --> 01:07:57.302]  It's a benefit concert coming up tomorrow, I mean, not tomorrow, coming up on Saturday.
[01:07:57.322 --> 01:08:01.605]  I don't even know what day of the week it is anymore.
[01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:04.087]  I just worked seven days a week here trying to finish endgame.
[01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:08.830]  And they've got military fixed-wing aircraft flying over very low at treetop.
[01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:09.831]  They were reporting.
[01:08:10.653 --> 01:08:24.640]  And also, I know that Danny Romero got a call about a week ago from a federal marshal saying you can't have a concert up there, you don't have a permit.
[01:08:25.021 --> 01:08:28.142]  What are the feds doing talking about permits, local zoning rules?
[01:08:28.763 --> 01:08:32.705]  And then now Elaine's been contacted with something similar.
[01:08:33.385 --> 01:08:35.246]  So we've got Elaine Brown.
[01:08:36.701 --> 01:08:37.842]  Alex, this is Weaver.
[01:08:37.862 --> 01:08:39.162]  I got the phone right now.
[01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:39.482]  Oh, shoot, Nick.
[01:09:04.167 --> 01:09:05.247]  Today's Thursday.
[01:09:05.267 --> 01:09:08.048]  We must have got up here about last Friday, I believe.
[01:09:08.488 --> 01:09:11.029]  Wow, so tell me about the aircraft.
[01:09:11.449 --> 01:09:12.869]  Tell us about it.
[01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:16.430]  It looked like a civilian corporate jet type.
[01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:17.991]  You know, it could have been an FBI or whatever.
[01:09:18.031 --> 01:09:19.891]  They've got them flying in and out of here, I'm sure.
[01:09:20.311 --> 01:09:24.573]  Okay, we were told this morning by everybody else that it looked like a fixed-wing military aircraft.
[01:09:24.633 --> 01:09:26.633]  All right, we're glad we got that straightened out.
[01:09:27.033 --> 01:09:29.414]  Yeah, I think everything's normal.
[01:09:29.434 --> 01:09:31.695]  It's a beautiful day and we're going to have a good party.
[01:09:33.556 --> 01:09:39.458]  I think once the people come in here, we're going to have a good time.
[01:09:40.638 --> 01:09:42.138]  I don't worry about all this stuff, I guess.
[01:09:42.818 --> 01:09:47.960]  I don't get as paranoid as some people do, but I'm not worried about it, Alex, right now.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:55.002]  If they want to pull a bunch of crap, they're going to have a whole bunch of people they're going to have to deal with, and I don't think they're going to do it.
[01:09:55.222 --> 01:10:00.483]  Yeah, well, what happened is, I guess it was actually about a week and a half ago, that federal marshal called Danny, one of the organizers of it,
[01:10:01.187 --> 01:10:04.231]  And then there was a quandary of, well, should we even get into this?
[01:10:04.271 --> 01:10:05.853]  Because it's obviously color of law.
[01:10:06.113 --> 01:10:09.978]  It was meant for us to go on air, run with it, and then scare people off from it.
[01:10:10.578 --> 01:10:14.062]  And then that made the rounds around in the patriot movement.
[01:10:14.082 --> 01:10:16.065]  People called me and said, why aren't you talking about it?
[01:10:16.505 --> 01:10:18.907]  And I'm just like, you know, you can't satisfy anybody.
[01:10:19.267 --> 01:10:30.496]  And so now, though, Elaine did tell my producer this morning that, indeed, somebody did contact him and say, you better not have the event.
[01:10:30.736 --> 01:10:33.278]  So I think we owe it to people to go ahead and tell folks about that.
[01:10:33.899 --> 01:10:43.466]  Well, the reason I, you know, these rumors keep going around and all this stuff, and I think it's part of psychological warfare.
[01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:44.487]  Oh, it is, no doubt, yeah.
[01:10:45.003 --> 01:10:45.904]  Well, I tend to agree with you.
[01:10:45.924 --> 01:10:49.467]  I think it's about a 99% chance that this is a complete and total bluff, and that's clearly what it is.
[01:10:49.547 --> 01:10:55.972]  And you're absolutely right, and it's going to be a great event with music and how they're drawing attention to this whole situation.
[01:11:12.538 --> 01:11:14.120]  Yes, you see a U.S.
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:17.924]  Marshal calling to see if he can get a permit for a local jamboree.
[01:11:17.944 --> 01:11:19.265]  See, that doesn't make any sense.
[01:11:19.785 --> 01:11:24.070]  But I think it's intended to scare people and to put the word out and scare more people.
[01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:25.211]  Make them paranoid.
[01:11:25.351 --> 01:11:26.572]  Let's show them we're not paranoid.
[01:11:26.993 --> 01:11:28.274]  That's what this whole game is about.
[01:11:28.334 --> 01:11:29.795]  We've got to show them we're not afraid.
[01:11:31.065 --> 01:11:31.666]  Let's do it.
[01:11:31.686 --> 01:11:35.149]  Let's come up and have a good time and just stick it in her face.
[01:11:35.389 --> 01:11:40.013]  Well, Randy, I just appreciate you being up there and supporting the Browns, and I pray for them every night.
[01:11:40.674 --> 01:11:49.982]  And it's a great victory for liberty and freedom that the Feds haven't moved in on them, because now the media keeps covering the standoff and saying, well, why aren't the Feds going in?
[01:11:50.363 --> 01:11:53.546]  Well, because then it'll draw attention to the fact that the Browns are right.
[01:11:54.246 --> 01:11:54.626]  Yes.
[01:11:54.807 --> 01:11:55.808]  Well, yes, Randy.
[01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:58.791]  You know, the feds know the boundaries, right?
[01:11:59.011 --> 01:12:10.197]  And some of them, they're just, but they're still going to take them orders, because they're just paid mercenaries, you know, but I don't think they're going to get orders in the near future to come in and kill anybody or any of that stuff.
[01:12:10.257 --> 01:12:11.637]  I just, I don't have that feeling.
[01:12:12.218 --> 01:12:17.180]  If I'm totally wrong, why, I think it's going to be a big mistake on their part, either way they play this game.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:21.682]  So, well, we just got to wait it out and see what happens.
[01:12:22.523 --> 01:12:23.523]  Absolutely, Randy.
[01:12:23.723 --> 01:12:25.224]  Do you have Ed or Elaine Brown there, Bob?
[01:12:26.076 --> 01:12:27.417]  Uh, they're over here in the porch.
[01:12:27.497 --> 01:12:28.897]  Terry's sitting here in the grass.
[01:12:29.498 --> 01:12:32.879]  I'll hand the phone to Terry and then I'll go get Elaine Redd.
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:36.681]  Thank you, but hang around because I want to get you back on before you go there.
[01:12:38.462 --> 01:12:40.343]  Thanks a lot.
[01:12:41.364 --> 01:12:42.284]  Hey Terry, how you doing?
[01:12:42.824 --> 01:12:43.385]  Good, how are you?
[01:12:43.925 --> 01:12:44.145]  Good.
[01:12:44.165 --> 01:12:46.866]  I wasn't going to get into all this rumor mongering but it got out.
[01:12:48.866 --> 01:12:52.108]  And then everybody was calling me asking why I wasn't covering the rumor mongering.
[01:12:52.588 --> 01:12:55.190]  And so we're now doing it to satisfy everyone out there.
[01:12:55.910 --> 01:13:00.413]  But what type of aircraft flew over and what exactly happened?
[01:13:01.173 --> 01:13:04.335]  Well, Randy didn't really see the plane that we saw.
[01:13:05.195 --> 01:13:09.038]  There were... Yes, sir.
[01:13:09.058 --> 01:13:09.918]  Your cell phone's cut now.
[01:13:09.958 --> 01:13:10.298]  Go ahead.
[01:13:10.479 --> 01:13:10.779]  Okay.
[01:13:10.859 --> 01:13:11.099]  Okay.
[01:13:11.119 --> 01:13:12.099]  Yeah.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.701]  There were three of us that were up on the hill.
[01:13:15.481 --> 01:13:16.822]  And I've been here about three weeks.
[01:13:18.649 --> 01:13:19.109]  We're good to go.
[01:13:46.741 --> 01:13:47.522]  Yes, Terry.
[01:13:48.042 --> 01:13:49.523]  What else have you seen in the last few days?
[01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:53.527]  It's been actually kind of peaceful around here.
[01:13:55.008 --> 01:14:00.553]  This morning we did see a couple ambulances heading in this direction.
[01:14:00.833 --> 01:14:05.016]  You know, like if they were going to stage somewhere.
[01:14:05.036 --> 01:14:08.900]  You know, but it's quiet around here.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.021]  Everybody's kind of relaxed.
[01:14:11.362 --> 01:14:13.664]  Minus, you know, it just seems like things are kind of getting
[01:14:15.221 --> 01:14:16.382]  Hold on, here's Ed.
[01:14:19.083 --> 01:14:19.963]  Hey, how you doing guys?
[01:14:20.203 --> 01:14:21.944]  Hey Ed, we're all praying for you.
[01:14:21.984 --> 01:14:24.705]  I'm glad that seems like everything's settled down up there.
[01:14:24.745 --> 01:14:27.026]  You guys got a big event coming up Saturday.
[01:14:28.027 --> 01:14:29.207]  Yeah, yeah, it should be fun.
[01:14:29.708 --> 01:14:30.608]  I have a party.
[01:14:31.286 --> 01:14:36.731]  It's not my birthday the following week anyway, so... So it's a combination birthday party, 4th of July.
[01:14:36.751 --> 01:14:37.251]  See?
[01:14:38.252 --> 01:14:39.173]  That's what it's all about.
[01:14:39.893 --> 01:14:44.977]  Yeah, they come over and they make their statements, but again, who cares what they do?
[01:14:45.998 --> 01:14:48.320]  They're dealing with a bunch of grown-up babies.
[01:14:49.621 --> 01:14:51.783]  Who all, that's all they've got is intimidation.
[01:14:52.984 --> 01:14:56.007]  All these people are a bunch of mercenaries with a mercenary mentality.
[01:14:56.047 --> 01:14:56.767]  They're too stupid.
[01:14:56.947 --> 01:15:00.110]  And I'm sorry, I'm here to irritate them as much as I can from now on.
[01:15:00.666 --> 01:15:02.248]  Because it's too stupid.
[01:15:03.009 --> 01:15:09.697]  The law is very... Now there's a new case down here with a gentleman in Alabama.
[01:15:11.099 --> 01:15:12.000]  He just won the case?
[01:15:13.722 --> 01:15:14.083]  Uh, yes.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.322]  Tommy, Donnie did.
[01:15:16.822 --> 01:15:18.685]  The case is hardly any different than our case.
[01:15:19.466 --> 01:15:23.992]  How can he win his case in Florida, and his case be lost up here in New Hampshire?
[01:15:24.012 --> 01:15:29.540]  Well the IRS is losing cases coast to coast now, as the jury's learned the truth.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.622]  Now, Ed Brown...
[01:15:31.767 --> 01:15:37.173]  I mean, just to be specific, we know that Danny Romero did get a call from the federal marshals about a week and a half ago.
[01:15:38.014 --> 01:15:39.155]  Now that's out on record.
[01:15:39.756 --> 01:15:40.997]  But it was pure intimidation.
[01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:43.820]  Just, well, you might not want to do that because you don't have a permit.
[01:15:44.581 --> 01:15:45.462]  We've checked the zoning.
[01:15:45.482 --> 01:15:46.743]  You're not even within any zoning.
[01:15:47.024 --> 01:15:48.946]  You can have a party on your private property.
[01:15:50.462 --> 01:15:52.783]  If you want to, this is just classic intimidation.
[01:15:53.043 --> 01:15:54.504]  You're saying they've made their statements.
[01:15:54.544 --> 01:15:57.565]  Have you had the police visit you or anything else?
[01:15:57.845 --> 01:15:58.185]  No.
[01:15:58.226 --> 01:16:00.266]  They're welcome to come up and visit me if they want to.
[01:16:00.286 --> 01:16:02.267]  They notify me that they're coming up anytime.
[01:16:02.587 --> 01:16:05.729]  Matter of fact, the federal marshals, I've told Gary Demartini, the U.S.
[01:16:05.789 --> 01:16:06.049]  Marshal,
[01:16:06.454 --> 01:16:11.260]  Well, we're just very happy that we were able to avert them coming in on you a few weeks ago and that hopefully things are de-escalating.
[01:16:25.976 --> 01:16:33.223]  Hopefully having an event up there will turn out to bring more attention to the case and educate more people and get more light on you guys.
[01:16:33.263 --> 01:16:35.085]  What we wanted three, four weeks ago happened.
[01:16:35.505 --> 01:16:47.837]  It's been all over CNN, Fox, MSNBC, and so now that makes it less likely for them to move in on you and more likely that we'll get a peaceful resolution out of all of this.
[01:16:47.857 --> 01:16:48.938]  So just God bless you, Ed.
[01:16:48.978 --> 01:16:49.759]  We're praying for you.
[01:16:50.079 --> 01:16:51.140]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:16:52.109 --> 01:16:52.789]  I know.
[01:16:52.849 --> 01:16:53.830]  That's about it right now.
[01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:58.692]  We certainly appreciate the help we're getting from everybody that's coming and going, as well as all the prayers.
[01:16:59.652 --> 01:17:00.113]  It's helping.
[01:17:00.733 --> 01:17:02.013]  I guess the prayers must be working.
[01:17:02.053 --> 01:17:03.074]  Nobody's come down here yet.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:09.183]  It is working, Ed, and a lot of that's also you and your wife's courage and the people that have been standing with you.
[01:17:09.443 --> 01:17:13.165]  And of course, Randy Weaver especially really helped get a lot of attention to this.
[01:17:13.225 --> 01:17:15.046]  In fact, God bless you, my friend.
[01:17:15.066 --> 01:17:19.969]  We'll get an update from you and the network's going to have live coverage of the event on Saturday here at Genesis.
[01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:23.791]  Can I just real quick speak to Randy again?
[01:17:24.432 --> 01:17:25.292]  Yes, Randy's right here.
[01:17:25.692 --> 01:17:26.993]  Thank you, Ed Brown.
[01:17:29.582 --> 01:17:30.163]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:17:30.383 --> 01:17:32.144]  Randy, this is the last minute we've got left.
[01:17:32.164 --> 01:17:33.865]  I wanted to give you the last word.
[01:17:33.885 --> 01:17:35.366]  Anything else you wanted to add?
[01:17:36.407 --> 01:17:44.834]  I just want to say, Alex, that we're going to have great weather as forecast, and we would just love to have local countries show up.
[01:17:44.974 --> 01:17:53.960]  It would be so awesome, because the only thing, it's a psychological warfare game right now, and we've got to let them know that we are not afraid of them.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:54.581]  Not one lick.
[01:17:55.177 --> 01:17:59.781]  Well, I would certainly be there if I didn't have this in-game deadline.
[01:18:00.322 --> 01:18:01.943]  I am behind finishing the film.
[01:18:02.023 --> 01:18:02.724]  I am racing.
[01:18:02.764 --> 01:18:04.205]  I'm here until two in the morning every night.
[01:18:04.706 --> 01:18:06.707]  And it's the best film I've ever made, the most important.
[01:18:07.088 --> 01:18:11.632]  But I'll probably, once it's done, go up there and visit what's going on in the near future.
[01:18:11.692 --> 01:18:16.936]  So, I want to thank you, Randy, though, for going up there three weeks ago and for being back there now.
[01:18:17.557 --> 01:18:21.540]  And anybody else creeping around on your property since the last time?
[01:18:23.717 --> 01:18:25.078]  No, uh-uh.
[01:18:25.278 --> 01:18:28.841]  Terry just told me he wants to talk to you when you're done here on the show, and I want to thank you.
[01:18:28.921 --> 01:18:29.962]  Keep up the good work, Alex.
[01:18:30.402 --> 01:18:30.862]  Thank you.
[01:18:31.242 --> 01:18:32.884]  You can hand it back to Terry there.
[01:18:32.904 --> 01:18:33.864]  I'll talk to him during the break.
[01:18:34.064 --> 01:18:35.225]  We've got Ron Paul coming up.
[01:18:35.245 --> 01:18:37.246]  We'll take a few calls before that happens.
[01:18:37.427 --> 01:18:46.353]  And we've got a bunch of news on the incredible terror, fear-mongering by the occupational government that we have that is occupying the 50 states.
[01:18:46.413 --> 01:18:46.953]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:54.073 --> 01:18:59.318]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:18:59.459 --> 01:19:07.547]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:19:07.807 --> 01:19:14.854]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:19:15.034 --> 01:19:16.315]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:19:16.395 --> 01:19:22.300]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:27.584]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:19:27.684 --> 01:19:36.552]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:19:36.832 --> 01:19:40.114]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:19:42.376 --> 01:19:59.421]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:20:00.621 --> 01:20:05.443]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:05.663 --> 01:20:08.404]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:08.444 --> 01:20:09.524]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:10.896 --> 01:20:15.477]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:16.418 --> 01:20:23.680]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:27.741]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:20:28.641 --> 01:20:33.343]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:20:34.323 --> 01:20:35.603]  Call for your copy today.
[01:20:35.623 --> 01:20:35.823]  It's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:39.093 --> 01:20:46.497]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the red book in your library.
[01:20:46.677 --> 01:20:48.137]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:48.197 --> 01:20:51.419]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:51.519 --> 01:20:58.582]  Hello, I'm Dr. Bill Deagles, a nuclear medical reporter here on Genesis After Alex Jones 2-4 Monday to Friday.
[01:20:58.822 --> 01:21:07.186]  We developed the first line of defense kit to block pathogenic infective organisms to give you day-to-day protection as well as infection protection against biological and chemical weapons.
[01:21:07.266 --> 01:21:08.507]  Defense tabs block viruses
[01:21:08.507 --> 01:21:09.067]  We're good to go!
[01:21:35.148 --> 01:21:36.728]  Are you lacking energy on a daily basis?
[01:21:36.748 --> 01:21:37.749]  Do you feel tired all the
[01:22:00.742 --> 01:22:01.062]  Let's do it!
[01:22:30.549 --> 01:22:32.230]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.346]  No matter how hard you try!
[01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:31.329]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:31.349 --> 01:23:32.690]  My fellow renegades.
[01:23:59.634 --> 01:24:01.255]  Rob in Dubai was able to get back in.
[01:24:01.275 --> 01:24:02.715]  I'm going to go to Jake and others.
[01:24:03.776 --> 01:24:05.977]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Rob.
[01:24:06.017 --> 01:24:06.617]  Thanks for holding.
[01:24:07.698 --> 01:24:08.678]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[01:24:09.478 --> 01:24:10.599]  Thanks for having me back on.
[01:24:11.199 --> 01:24:19.303]  So, you know, I was talking earlier on about the situation as I see it working in and around that industry.
[01:24:19.543 --> 01:24:21.364]  But you had some good news, that was the point.
[01:24:21.604 --> 01:24:25.145]  I had good news, yes, I've got good news in the fight against the New World Order, okay?
[01:24:26.046 --> 01:24:26.546]  Basically,
[01:24:27.213 --> 01:24:40.578]  Friends of mine in Ireland have mobilized in their way of being strategic in trying to get back to the New World Order and I'm speaking specifically of its manifestation where I come from and that's the European Union.
[01:24:41.239 --> 01:24:52.323]  And as you know, there's a decision been made in Europe of the 27 countries, 25 will not hold referenda about the new constitution, only two will and that's my country Ireland and Denmark.
[01:24:52.943 --> 01:24:54.664]  Well a large group of people in Ireland
[01:24:55.226 --> 01:24:58.909]  I don't know if you know Freedom Force.
[01:24:59.129 --> 01:25:01.130]  I'm not on here to plug a website.
[01:25:01.230 --> 01:25:02.952]  I've had Ed Griffin on many times.
[01:25:02.972 --> 01:25:07.114]  He's got his Freedom Force and you're fighting EU expansion.
[01:25:07.134 --> 01:25:07.495]  Go ahead.
[01:25:08.395 --> 01:25:08.816]  Exactly.
[01:25:08.856 --> 01:25:12.078]  We're essentially part of Ed Griffin's covert
[01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:13.031]  Yeah, I think.
[01:25:33.408 --> 01:25:55.033]  No, I mean we have to have a multi, not even a pincer attack, but we have to hit them from 50 different angles, inside, outside, I mean everybody just pick a way to attack the New World Order and just attack, and it's literally, even their supercomputers cannot track random human values and activities, and they cannot stop us, and we're going to beat them, and listen,
[01:25:56.255 --> 01:26:02.236]  Every year they refuse to give us, every year they refuse to give us, at first, the information out of Bilderberg.
[01:26:02.256 --> 01:26:10.138]  I mean, the hotel staff, managers, when they hear how evil they are, when they hear how they plan to destroy freedom, they instantly give us everything.
[01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:12.618]  I mean, even hotel managers, folks.
[01:26:13.038 --> 01:26:18.159]  Because, I mean, when you're there hearing about how your country's going to be slaves, your children are going to be slaves, and I mean, they talk like that.
[01:26:18.659 --> 01:26:19.800]  I mean, we've gotten minutes out.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.240]  It is, I mean, these people are evil.
[01:26:21.852 --> 01:26:24.134]  And folks hear that and they go, my God, it's all real!
[01:26:24.194 --> 01:26:25.255]  I'm not going along with this!
[01:26:25.576 --> 01:26:28.198]  Well, let me tell you folks, we're going to beat the New World Order.
[01:26:28.759 --> 01:26:34.644]  And yes, I know that Ireland also didn't allow EU expansion, and so Ireland is growing at like, what, 10%?
[01:26:34.685 --> 01:26:36.807]  The rest of Europe is growing at about 2.5, 3%.
[01:26:36.867 --> 01:26:37.407]  Ireland has, what, a
[01:26:41.264 --> 01:26:42.725]  What a 10% flat tax.
[01:26:43.545 --> 01:26:49.408]  Ireland is going the opposite direction and is now the new Mecca of business outside of China.
[01:26:50.889 --> 01:26:52.469]  I hear super things about Ireland.
[01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:55.691]  Is the financial analysis I've been getting about Ireland accurate?
[01:26:56.693 --> 01:27:02.417]  Well, it is Alex, and another thing about it is that the 9-11 Truth Movement is really big there.
[01:27:02.737 --> 01:27:09.142]  I can't remember the name of the guy who wrote that book, The New Pearl Harbor, but it's an excellent book.
[01:27:09.802 --> 01:27:17.047]  David Ray Griffin, he's coming over to Ireland for a really big talk to about 100-150 people who are essentially involved in Ed Griffin's movement.
[01:27:17.527 --> 01:27:25.173]  So, you know, it's really well-organized there, and there's a lot of education among the general populace, because our media isn't quite as controlled, although they're trying to do it now.
[01:27:25.213 --> 01:27:27.334]  No, I know, I personally have been in a lot of those.
[01:27:27.535 --> 01:27:29.216]  Listen, I appreciate your call, I gotta jump.
[01:27:30.156 --> 01:27:36.061]  But, yeah, by the way, we carry Ed Griffin's book, Debunking 9-11 Debunking.
[01:27:36.881 --> 01:27:39.343]  And it totally shows the lies, the fraud.
[01:27:39.643 --> 01:27:45.648]  When somebody goes, oh, I read about the mechanics, or I heard they debunked it, it was all disinfo.
[01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:48.931]  And a lot of it's flat-out lies.
[01:27:49.692 --> 01:27:53.335]  They say stuff like, only one jet in U.S.
[01:27:53.375 --> 01:27:56.757]  history had ever been intercepted by NORAD, and that was Payne Stewart.
[01:27:57.237 --> 01:27:58.658]  Because they knew the public knew about that.
[01:27:59.179 --> 01:28:02.561]  Turned out it was 167 of them in the year before 9-11.
[01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:13.790]  And we even have the guy they quote in there, in Reuters, we already discovered all that, but of course, Griffin puts that in his book, and he just codifies it all, just showing, oh, you're Steve Bonta!
[01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:15.411]  Oh, here, have this!
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:18.401]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[01:28:18.421 --> 01:28:20.842]  I hadn't really plugged down in a while, so there's your plug for it.
[01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:21.962]  We have a discounted there on the site.
[01:28:23.743 --> 01:28:25.443]  Visit InfoWars.com today.
[01:28:25.483 --> 01:28:28.664]  We'll be right back to see if Ron Paul calls in from the floor of the house.
[01:28:29.745 --> 01:28:35.987]  And we will continue with your phone calls and a ton of news right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:36.007 --> 01:28:36.367]  Stay with me.
[01:28:44.022 --> 01:28:47.045]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.946 --> 01:28:50.729]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.811 --> 01:28:58.738]  Hi, my name's Don Whiskin and for over seven years I've been telling people about cardiobite.
[01:28:59.058 --> 01:29:02.602]  Here's Dr. John Matson, a naturopathic doctor, and his views on cardiobite.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:08.082]  You're making my job so much easier because your products just make it so simple, right?
[01:29:08.102 --> 01:29:13.645]  To fool around with a lot of exotic things that don't work, we can just put them on carnivite and things start to work almost right away.
[01:29:13.905 --> 01:29:22.150]  I've had dozens and dozens of patients with heart problems who have corrected them and what it's doing, there's so much garlic in there that has a yeast killing effect.
[01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:25.232]  That yeast is a big problem in the gut, pushes the liver hard.
[01:29:25.292 --> 01:29:32.096]  It also has metal chelating effect and most of the other herbs in there I find that strengthen the arteries, they help to neutralize free radicals.
[01:29:32.256 --> 01:29:37.219]  Your remedy is as close to what we do in our program as you can get as far as one supplement goes.
[01:29:37.419 --> 01:29:41.161]  It's working on the gut, it's working on the liver, it's working on the arteries.
[01:29:41.541 --> 01:29:42.561]  What more can you ask for?

[01:32:04.497 --> 01:32:13.020]  I'm told they're dragging Ron Paul off the floor of the house with the telephone.
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:13.161]  Ha!
[01:32:13.341 --> 01:32:14.181]  He's so busy.
[01:32:30.730 --> 01:32:47.237]  Before we get him on, I want to just tell all the listeners, I'm a documentary filmmaker and at Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terrorism, is now available the second edition, the final edition, the final cut, whatever you like to call it.

[01:33:15.698 --> 01:33:18.179]  Also, we have a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[01:33:18.379 --> 01:33:19.920]  It's up there now for download.
[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:21.541]  Going up later today.
[01:33:21.721 --> 01:33:22.401]  It looks great.
[01:33:22.682 --> 01:33:24.162]  We've got the latest Flash.
[01:33:24.503 --> 01:33:28.164]  So instead of downloading, you can watch it live while you download it.
[01:33:28.725 --> 01:33:33.047]  So we've added some more servers and they're adding different features right now.
[01:33:33.967 --> 01:33:35.508]  Been testing those out the last few weeks.
[01:33:35.548 --> 01:33:36.929]  Now we're doing a live test of it.
[01:33:37.789 --> 01:33:40.791]  But PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[01:33:41.771 --> 01:33:45.033]  All, now 16 of my films are the second version of Terror Storm.

[01:34:15.962 --> 01:34:16.423]  I don't know.
[01:34:31.798 --> 01:34:33.698]  You get a year membership, you get three months free.
[01:34:34.059 --> 01:34:35.619]  PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:43.581]  That's how we pay for the servers and the webmasters and everything.
[01:34:43.641 --> 01:34:44.461]  Thank you for your membership.
[01:34:44.761 --> 01:34:47.882]  And also use it as a tool of resistance.
[01:34:48.642 --> 01:34:54.204]  Use it as a foundry to build the info weapons you need.
[01:34:54.664 --> 01:34:55.844]  A armory.
[01:34:56.611 --> 01:35:01.055]  A arsenal in the Infowar, an arsenal of liberty, an arsenal of freedom.
[01:35:01.355 --> 01:35:04.918]  Go there, burn whatever TV show, whatever special report you want.
[01:35:05.058 --> 01:35:09.381]  We're going to take a video of the three-part series on eugenics in the next few weeks.
[01:35:09.441 --> 01:35:10.162]  Put that up.
[01:35:11.202 --> 01:35:12.343]  Part three hasn't even been shot yet.
[01:35:12.363 --> 01:35:14.445]  We'll do that live in studio on Friday with Aaron Dice.
[01:35:14.905 --> 01:35:16.887]  That way you can see the books, the documents we're talking about.
[01:35:17.167 --> 01:35:18.488]  That's going to be up there for members.
[01:35:18.748 --> 01:35:19.809]  You can just burn it to dust.
[01:35:19.889 --> 01:35:20.510]  Give it to people.
[01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:23.632]  I mean, that's really how we're getting the word out.
[01:35:24.412 --> 01:35:27.213]  So we get more material out, not just my 16 films now.
[01:35:28.373 --> 01:35:32.954]  And Endgame will be up there before we even ship it out to people.
[01:35:34.114 --> 01:35:37.995]  So you'll get it within a week to two weeks before you'll get Endgame.
[01:35:38.976 --> 01:35:49.018]  In mid-October, instead of October 31st or October 30th, when it hits stores, the stores around the country, it'll be carrying Endgame, Blueprint for Global, and Slavement.
[01:35:50.504 --> 01:35:56.426]  And again, it's pretty regular when Ron Paul is on the floor in the years past.
[01:35:56.446 --> 01:35:59.447]  You've experienced him having trouble getting him on exactly when he says he'd be on.
[01:36:00.527 --> 01:36:14.032]  Now it's even more stuff added because he can't have his federal staff there at the Congress communicate with his presidential staff because of all the ridiculous free speech attacking election laws.
[01:36:14.784 --> 01:36:20.806]  Which if you're a corrupt globalist, you don't have to follow, but if you're a patriot, Ron Paul has to literally pass white glove inspection.
[01:36:21.006 --> 01:36:21.886]  But enough said!
[01:36:22.406 --> 01:36:28.608]  We have the illustrious Congressman, he'd hate it if I said that, but I did, with us online for his monthly visit with us.
[01:36:29.148 --> 01:36:33.289]  And I look at him on TV, he still is looking great for 74, but I can't see his
[01:36:34.109 --> 01:36:35.410]  Good to be with you again.
[01:36:58.030 --> 01:37:02.476]  Congressman, just out of the gate, Cindy Sheehan yesterday on my show went further than anybody's ever gone.
[01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:07.542]  She said, distinct chance of staged terror attack or the government allowing that to happen.
[01:37:07.983 --> 01:37:09.845]  Bush is saying he doesn't care what the people want.
[01:37:09.865 --> 01:37:10.906]  The war will continue.
[01:37:11.287 --> 01:37:13.089]  They've set up the Military Commissions Act.
[01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:15.372]  They've set up the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:37:15.732 --> 01:37:19.973]  He signed PDD 51, making himself literally dictator.
[01:37:20.793 --> 01:37:22.994]  He gave himself that power.
[01:37:23.454 --> 01:37:27.895]  How much danger are we in now with the Homeland Security head feeling in his gut we're about to be hit?
[01:37:28.135 --> 01:37:34.037]  Republican memos saying they need terror attacks, they need Al Qaeda to hit us to be able to continue the war.
[01:37:34.377 --> 01:37:36.378]  Top military strategists saying it.
[01:37:36.918 --> 01:37:40.599]  How much danger are we in of some new Gulf of Tonkin provocation?
[01:37:41.554 --> 01:37:43.075]  I think we're in great danger of it.
[01:37:43.095 --> 01:37:44.495]  We're in danger in many ways.
[01:37:44.535 --> 01:37:54.159]  The attack on our civil liberties here at home, the foreign policy that's in shambles, and our obligations overseas and commitment which endangers our troops and our national defense.
[01:37:55.199 --> 01:38:04.083]  So every day we're in worse shape and right now there's an orchestrated effort to blame the Iranians for everything that's gone wrong in Iraq.
[01:38:04.859 --> 01:38:15.024]  And we're quite concerned of any of us that the attack will be on Iran, and that will confuse things and jeopardize so many more of our troops.
[01:38:15.604 --> 01:38:28.310]  So I would say that we're in a much greater danger than we've been, you know, even four or five years ago, whether it's overseas or even by terrorists here at home, because I just think the policies are seriously flawed.
[01:38:28.991 --> 01:38:32.254]  Now, Doctor, you're a veteran of the Vietnam War era.
[01:38:32.374 --> 01:38:36.437]  You, of course, also delivered more than 4,000 babies.
[01:38:36.477 --> 01:38:38.779]  That gets you a real understanding of real psychology.
[01:38:39.299 --> 01:38:43.523]  I studied Napoleon, Hitler, Julius Caesar.
[01:38:44.518 --> 01:38:47.360]  To understand, they seem to have the same mindset.
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:50.701]  Normal people don't have this mindset, but they tend to act the same.
[01:38:51.021 --> 01:38:56.224]  Hitler, when he lost the Battle of Britain, went into Africa and went into Russia.
[01:38:57.625 --> 01:38:59.165]  Napoleon did the same thing.
[01:38:59.686 --> 01:39:02.027]  Literally, Africa, the Middle East, and Russia.
[01:39:03.269 --> 01:39:05.150]  And they tend to try to fail forward.
[01:39:05.531 --> 01:39:14.038]  And now neocons are openly, as you know, saying in publications that they've got to escalate things, even win the Iraq War, which we know was the PNAC plan to begin with.
[01:39:14.078 --> 01:39:17.021]  Are we looking at the equivalent of Hitler turning East?
[01:39:17.615 --> 01:39:37.304]  I don't know whether it's the equivalent, but it certainly, psychologically, it means that when these people get their back up to the wall, they're not going to reverse their thought processes, and they will not change policy, and they just get more aggressive and advance more, you know, aggressively with the policy that they thought would work in the past.
[01:39:37.624 --> 01:39:41.606]  They will not accept the fact that it's failed and change their policy.
[01:39:41.646 --> 01:39:47.049]  And that's why we're facing this crisis, is there's no willingness to truly reassess
[01:39:47.869 --> 01:39:49.970]  The Congress doesn't have much of a backbone.
[01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:51.611]  They're not forcing them to do much.
[01:39:52.212 --> 01:39:57.074]  And certainly the election hasn't helped a whole lot last fall, even though the American people are sick of it.
[01:39:57.715 --> 01:39:59.516]  But eventually it's going to end.
[01:39:59.576 --> 01:40:10.642]  I just wish it would end more gracefully than waiting for a total collapse of our economy, because there's no way we can afford what we're doing, whether it's the domestic spending or the international spending.
[01:40:11.269 --> 01:40:13.750]  And very few people talk about the real cost of this.
[01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:17.092]  You know, economically speaking, there's a tremendous cost in life and limb.
[01:40:17.993 --> 01:40:24.877]  But economically, this is unsustainable, and it will be a threat to our dollar, and our dollar is not doing that well right now.
[01:40:24.997 --> 01:40:26.698]  Well, you brought me to my next question, sir.
[01:40:27.438 --> 01:40:33.742]  Four years ago, I spoke at the same event as you did in Bastrop, and you said at that event that you would send the next five to
[01:40:34.362 --> 01:40:48.421]  10 years the dollar would have to collapse we would have to go into a depression but the way that might actually reverse the corporate socialism and cronyism that we've seen now it's happening with about a half cent drop per week
[01:40:49.108 --> 01:40:58.773]  In the aggregate, which is a free fall in the scheme of time, the yuppies are finally starting to realize that dollar devaluation means something.
[01:40:59.073 --> 01:41:01.455]  You've been calling it that hidden super tax.
[01:41:01.995 --> 01:41:03.256]  Real inflation is at about 13.6.
[01:41:03.636 --> 01:41:08.178]  A lot of major banking houses are now putting that number out.
[01:41:08.959 --> 01:41:12.701]  The International Bank of Settlements, the head of the private central banking system,
[01:41:13.321 --> 01:41:15.223]  We certainly are getting closer to it.
[01:41:15.263 --> 01:41:16.724]  The big question is how long will the trust last?
[01:41:16.744 --> 01:41:20.547]  There is a trust in the system, but it's based on false information or false analogies.
[01:41:35.994 --> 01:41:38.235]  And as long as there's trust, it'll continue to work.
[01:41:38.315 --> 01:41:41.857]  But trust can be dissipated rather quickly.
[01:41:41.917 --> 01:41:46.199]  And once that trust is gone, the collapse, the end of a currency, goes rather quickly.
[01:41:46.219 --> 01:41:48.980]  So I have no idea.
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:50.281]  Nobody knows exactly when.
[01:41:50.361 --> 01:41:55.964]  But you know, if something terrible happened in the Middle East and we started bombing Iran and the
[01:41:57.099 --> 01:41:58.459]  Persian Gulf was closed.
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:10.182]  Since the dollar's not backed by anything, it potentially could drop and you'd have runaway inflation and interest rates going sky high and our economy would collapse.
[01:42:11.283 --> 01:42:13.803]  This is the kind of thing that people argue with me.
[01:42:13.843 --> 01:42:17.504]  They say, well, what you want to do is so drastic, it'd be radical, there's more chaos.
[01:42:17.564 --> 01:42:24.126]  But to continue to do what we're doing is much more likely to cause the chaos, which we're trying to avoid.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:41.915]  Congressman, if you had to put a date on it, and I know you don't like to do that, if they continue with the current orgy of spending and expenditures and more commitments, when do you think we'll see the massive reduction in standard of living?
[01:42:41.935 --> 01:42:51.023]  I mean, clearly we're seeing the incremental, and we're seeing an incremental plunge of the dollar, but when do you see some type of tipping point or more dramatic plunge?
[01:42:52.051 --> 01:42:52.732]  Well, you're right.
[01:42:52.792 --> 01:43:15.173]  I don't want to predict because I can't and nobody can, but I believe it's already started that we're in the early stages because the standard of living is going down for middle-class Americans, especially those poor individuals who are trying to pay their bills and trying to keep a decent-paying job, and they're the ones who suffer the most, and they are having a tough time because their inflation rate is probably much higher than
[01:43:15.634 --> 01:43:19.260]  The people on Wall Street who don't even care about inflation because they make money off it.
[01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:23.787]  So, it's already started down, but when it's going to collapse, who knows?
[01:43:23.887 --> 01:43:26.572]  I mean, it depends on world events.
[01:43:27.053 --> 01:43:29.257]  One single world event could change things overnight.
[01:43:29.824 --> 01:43:32.546]  I want to shift gears for a moment and talk about the campaign itself.
[01:43:32.826 --> 01:43:34.367]  I've got two short clips here.
[01:43:35.028 --> 01:43:44.714]  This is Stephanopoulos on the big Sunday morning show saying, you can't win, there's no way, which is basically like the bully saying, you know, there's no way you can win.
[01:43:45.235 --> 01:43:49.438]  And then contrasting that with somebody who actually knows politics.
[01:43:49.758 --> 01:43:56.242]  I mean, of course, Stephanopoulos does too, but of course, Scarborough saying, I'm talking to the next president of the United States.
[01:43:56.262 --> 01:43:57.363]  Let's play those clips back to back.
[01:43:58.234 --> 01:44:00.035]  What's success for you in this campaign?
[01:44:00.075 --> 01:44:00.715]  What success?
[01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:02.835]  Um, what, a win?
[01:44:02.855 --> 01:44:03.956]  Is one, one, is the goal?
[01:44:03.976 --> 01:44:06.556]  That's not going to happen.
[01:44:06.816 --> 01:44:08.957]  Do you, do you know for absolute?
[01:44:08.997 --> 01:44:12.378]  Are you willing to bet your every cent in your pocket for that?
[01:44:12.418 --> 01:44:12.578]  Yes.
[01:44:12.918 --> 01:44:13.238]  You are?
[01:44:13.258 --> 01:44:17.179]  Okay, uh, I thought so just when I ran for Congress.
[01:44:17.299 --> 01:44:20.240]  I bet, I wouldn't bet anything I could have been elected to Congress.
[01:44:21.323 --> 01:44:22.124]  The odds are great.
[01:44:22.204 --> 01:44:23.265]  The odds are difficult.
[01:44:23.725 --> 01:44:24.426]  And I know that.
[01:44:24.706 --> 01:44:30.031]  But I would say that what has happened so far is about 100 times greater than I anticipated.
[01:44:30.271 --> 01:44:32.954]  And I think that we have surprised a lot of people already.
[01:44:33.374 --> 01:44:34.876]  And I think we're going to surprise a lot more.
[01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:51.771]  So, Congressman, you know this, I understand this, a lot of people are starting to understand this.
[01:44:52.131 --> 01:44:54.472]  If you don't believe someone can win, they're never going to.
[01:44:54.532 --> 01:44:59.533]  It's like, well I like Ron Paul, I like Pat Buchanan, I like Ross Perot, but they can't ever win.
[01:44:59.853 --> 01:45:01.233]  I think you're the first candidate
[01:45:01.753 --> 01:45:15.149]  In all of my years since I was, you know, on my mama's knees watching the Nixon hearings, I think this is the first time that a true patriot, a true constitutionalist, has actually broken through their propaganda.
[01:45:15.169 --> 01:45:21.617]  I think that's because the media, alternative media, coming of age, has allowed that, plus you are a singularly excellent
[01:45:22.157 --> 01:45:24.798]  I think people are just now starting to realize that you really can win.
[01:45:46.932 --> 01:45:53.557]  Well, obviously we're working on that assumption and I think events are driving forces and events like
[01:45:54.245 --> 01:45:58.026]  The internet and talk shows, they're much more powerful than they used to be.
[01:45:58.087 --> 01:46:00.027]  But other events might make a big difference.
[01:46:00.047 --> 01:46:05.249]  The event that's going on in Iraq is certainly something that is drawing attention to the campaign.
[01:46:05.289 --> 01:46:09.831]  Because of my position for many, many years, even before it started, I warned about it.
[01:46:10.251 --> 01:46:11.431]  So that's a big issue.
[01:46:11.872 --> 01:46:23.736]  But if the economy continues to turn down and the dollar continues to weaken, maybe we can get the discussion really going on the nature of our monetary system and the Federal Reserve and the income tax.
[01:46:25.396 --> 01:46:29.718]  Many people have been talking about it, but it's always been squelched by the establishment.
[01:46:29.818 --> 01:46:39.281]  I think it may well come to the forefront, and they haven't had a public national discussion on monetary policy in many, many years, and it's overdue.
[01:46:43.872 --> 01:46:47.756]  Whereas in the past they would double-team us, where one party would be in favor, one party would be out.
[01:46:48.137 --> 01:46:55.384]  Now for the first time in modern history, since the last political realignment a hundred years ago, we're seeing both parties with about 12% approval ratings.
[01:46:56.145 --> 01:46:56.726]  What does that mean?
[01:46:57.941 --> 01:47:03.906]  Well it means the American people are alive and well and disgusted and yet they haven't had good alternatives.
[01:47:03.946 --> 01:47:05.407]  They can't go to third parties.
[01:47:05.427 --> 01:47:08.910]  That never seems to work because there's so many laws biased against them.
[01:47:09.370 --> 01:47:14.995]  But I think it shows that the American people are disgusted and it's justifiable, you know.
[01:47:15.395 --> 01:47:24.703]  So they are looking for true answers and options and quite frankly I think that's probably one of the reasons why our campaign is growing by leaps and bounds right now.
[01:47:25.535 --> 01:47:32.860]  But at the same time, the Democrats and Republicans are still racing ahead and promising to bring back amnesty, bring back North American Union proposals.
[01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:42.125]  I mean, is it just hubris, or are they so bought and paid for, they just have to publicly blow their cover and show everyone they don't work for us?
[01:47:42.345 --> 01:47:43.706]  Well, a lot is at stake for them.
[01:47:43.746 --> 01:47:51.471]  They don't want to disrupt the system, whether it's the military-industrial complex or the medical system where the corporations and drug companies make all the money, or
[01:47:53.733 --> 01:47:56.375]  Whether it's the interest that are served.
[01:47:56.395 --> 01:47:58.617]  So they have a lot at stake.
[01:47:59.037 --> 01:48:00.919]  So they're going to buck the people.
[01:48:01.359 --> 01:48:08.224]  The big question is, are the people awake enough where we are the majority and whether we will change the election.
[01:48:08.304 --> 01:48:12.868]  Because, you know, short of that, the alternatives aren't very good.
[01:48:12.988 --> 01:48:14.589]  So we have to use the system.
[01:48:14.649 --> 01:48:18.372]  We have to try to bring about changes in a reasonable fashion.
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:21.120]  And that's what I think this election is all about.
[01:48:21.381 --> 01:48:29.182]  Well, regardless, your campaign is educating hundreds of millions and bringing the message of liberty to the forefront like it's never been brought before.
[01:48:29.882 --> 01:48:31.963]  But I know that you really can win.
[01:48:32.003 --> 01:48:32.623]  I think you can.
[01:48:32.843 --> 01:48:35.203]  And more and more polls, you're starting to rise in them.
[01:48:35.964 --> 01:48:38.584]  When different organizations have polls, you're winning.
[01:48:39.104 --> 01:48:47.126]  And as you said, if you continue your growth rate, that's what the Las Vegas odds people said, even if it slows dramatically, you still are on target, sir, to win.
[01:48:48.041 --> 01:48:58.967]  Well, that remains to be seen, but we have to translate it into votes, and soon we're going to have some of these straw votes, and they're going to be very important, and we have to prove ourselves and continue to raise funds.
[01:48:59.537 --> 01:49:08.825]  And adding more volunteers like we've been doing, but it has to continue because it won't happen otherwise and then it eventually has to be at the polls.
[01:49:08.925 --> 01:49:12.928]  The Democrats, Cindy Sheehan now going to run against Pelosi trying to force impeachment.
[01:49:13.249 --> 01:49:18.373]  Do you see any type of major successful move towards impeachment, be it the Vice President or the President?
[01:49:19.278 --> 01:49:20.279]  I don't think so.
[01:49:20.339 --> 01:49:23.041]  I'm not expecting that to happen.
[01:49:23.061 --> 01:49:27.345]  Do we have both parties circling the wagons against the people right now?
[01:49:27.986 --> 01:49:29.006]  Oh, they always have.
[01:49:29.086 --> 01:49:38.294]  I think both parties serve the establishment, they serve Washington, D.C., and the people have to be really, really noisy in order to get their attention.
[01:49:38.655 --> 01:49:39.856]  Congressman, we're about to break.
[01:49:39.876 --> 01:49:42.097]  Let me just speak to you for one minute when we've got a break here.
[01:49:42.598 --> 01:49:43.178]  Please stay with us.
[01:49:43.198 --> 01:49:43.699]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.973 --> 01:49:57.575]  It's here!
[01:49:57.755 --> 01:50:02.537]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.897 --> 01:50:10.520]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.232 --> 01:50:18.295]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.695 --> 01:50:30.120]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:33.922]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.382 --> 01:50:36.323]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.643 --> 01:50:40.505]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:49.486 --> 01:51:52.148]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:54.490 --> 01:51:55.531]  The Digestive Tract.
[01:51:55.952 --> 01:51:58.854]  A natural waste factory built within all of our bodies.
[01:51:59.234 --> 01:52:04.239]  Roughly 25 feet of tunnels designed to absorb nutrition and then dispel the waste.
[01:52:04.659 --> 01:52:06.541]  But what happens when the waste gets clogged up?
[01:52:07.248 --> 01:52:14.271]  More than 4 million Americans have frequent constipation, accounting for 2.5 million physician visits a year.
[01:52:14.731 --> 01:52:19.674]  Now there's AlloCleanse, an all-natural formula based on herbs and safe enzymes.
[01:52:19.974 --> 01:52:25.356]  AlloCleanse gently sweeps the entire digestive tract and supports comfortable regular bathroom habits.
[01:52:25.536 --> 01:52:31.839]  You'll feel lighter, and you'll feel clean inside, and when you remove the waste buildup with AlloCleanse, you'll have more energy.
[01:52:32.119 --> 01:52:35.721]  Energy to use on other things, besides worrying about constipation.

[01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.309]  That's 1-800-890-3525.
[01:53:14.703 --> 01:53:16.223]  Brian won't help ya.
[01:53:18.644 --> 01:53:22.424]  You know good.
[01:53:22.604 --> 01:53:29.966]  Talked to the Congressman about his schedule and he is doing 30-40 interviews a day.
[01:53:32.186 --> 01:53:33.586]  And I'm always caught in a rockin' hard place.
[01:53:33.606 --> 01:53:35.607]  I get these emails and calls and public events.
[01:53:36.267 --> 01:53:38.167]  Why aren't you having Ron Paul on more, boy?
[01:53:39.386 --> 01:53:51.131]  I'm like, we have Ron Paul on every single day, and his staff is fully aware, and I was talking to him in the break, he says this show, and again like he said on air, you guys are his biggest supporters, but he's got to reach new people.
[01:53:53.132 --> 01:53:55.653]  And so that's why I don't want to put the screws to him too hard.
[01:53:55.693 --> 01:54:01.676]  We did get a full hour with the Congressman, just a few, what about four weeks ago, five weeks ago.
[01:54:03.456 --> 01:54:07.098]  And he did commit in the next few months, but this election is going to be going for another year.
[01:54:10.393 --> 01:54:13.516]  To come on for a full hour to take your calls.
[01:54:14.537 --> 01:54:25.448]  So that's good, and I know Ron Paul's a phenomenon and it's really exciting, but I mean, you know, I try to respond to requests by listeners, but I literally get emails going, it's a conspiracy that Ron Paul isn't on my show more.
[01:54:26.769 --> 01:54:29.012]  Again, I don't think, folks, you ever produce radio shows?
[01:54:29.052 --> 01:54:30.813]  You ever dealt with people in Congress?
[01:54:30.833 --> 01:54:31.114]  You ever?
[01:54:31.995 --> 01:54:33.116]  It's, believe me, we are
[01:54:33.777 --> 01:54:37.460]  We are trying as hard as we possibly can.
[01:55:04.696 --> 01:55:10.419]  Is it Jake or Jack?
[01:55:10.639 --> 01:55:11.039]  It's Jake.
[01:55:11.059 --> 01:55:11.679]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:55:11.699 --> 01:55:15.541]  Yeah, I'm here to talk about Adderall.
[01:55:17.082 --> 01:55:19.543]  Yes, one of the mind-altering, mind-bending drugs, yes.
[01:55:19.863 --> 01:55:27.126]  Yes, I was put on it by my doctor, and my grandpa's going to be cutting in and talking sometimes, too.
[01:55:28.487 --> 01:55:30.708]  So you're at Families Going on Drugs.
[01:55:31.818 --> 01:55:38.002]  Well, I have government documents that say they plan by 2000 to have about 20% of the population on these and they now have over 15.
[01:55:38.202 --> 01:55:41.264]  They're a little behind schedule and they admit it's to control you.
[01:55:42.325 --> 01:55:44.747]  So, you were put on Adderall because you weren't happy?
[01:55:44.787 --> 01:55:45.107]  They said.
[01:55:46.088 --> 01:55:46.708]  How old are you?
[01:55:47.429 --> 01:55:47.569]  I'm 10.
[01:55:49.306 --> 01:55:50.727]  I've been on it since first grade.
[01:55:51.287 --> 01:55:53.048]  And is this your father?
[01:55:53.068 --> 01:55:54.669]  This is, I'm the grandfather.
[01:55:55.329 --> 01:55:56.030]  Oh, grandfather.
[01:55:56.050 --> 01:55:57.210]  I didn't understand what he was saying.
[01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:58.591]  Yeah, he's staying with me.
[01:55:58.611 --> 01:56:01.853]  He's from Wisconsin and he started out at 5 milligrams.
[01:56:01.873 --> 01:56:03.113]  He's up to 30 milligrams.
[01:56:04.134 --> 01:56:08.997]  And right now at night he perspires and he reeks of toxin.
[01:56:10.457 --> 01:56:16.060]  Yeah, but is it your son or daughter that believes everything the system tells him?
[01:56:16.761 --> 01:56:17.121]  My daughter.
[01:56:19.591 --> 01:56:20.892]  Well this is just terrible.
[01:56:22.032 --> 01:56:24.373]  What was the excuse to put your grandson on it to begin with?
[01:56:25.354 --> 01:56:26.394]  Attention deficit.
[01:56:27.555 --> 01:56:36.019]  So when you buy a puppy and it runs around and bites and chews and gets excited with the energy of life in it, do we put puppies on drugs?
[01:56:36.039 --> 01:56:37.480]  I used to joke ten years ago about that.
[01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:42.163]  Now they actually do put puppies that have attention deficit, hyper puppies.
[01:56:43.023 --> 01:56:46.785]  All mammal species are excitable and aggressive, especially males.
[01:56:47.848 --> 01:56:49.628]  When they're young, when they're adolescent.
[01:56:51.049 --> 01:56:52.529]  But they put you on drugs.
[01:56:52.849 --> 01:56:57.770]  So your daughter thought it was unusual to have a misbehaving, aggressive five-year-old?
[01:56:58.510 --> 01:56:59.231]  What do you think, Jake?
[01:57:00.231 --> 01:57:00.331]  Yes.
[01:57:02.311 --> 01:57:05.952]  And have you told your daughter that she's hurting your son?
[01:57:07.272 --> 01:57:10.333]  I have and I will again before he goes back on Sunday.
[01:57:11.753 --> 01:57:14.934]  Well, you know, Adderall, from what I've read, is particularly deadly.
[01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:19.422]  Yes, it was abandoned Canada, as I understand, because of deaths.
[01:57:20.102 --> 01:57:22.764]  Yeah, there was 12 deaths in Canada.
[01:57:22.924 --> 01:57:23.124]  Yeah.
[01:57:23.204 --> 01:57:24.184]  And some injuries.
[01:57:24.525 --> 01:57:26.886]  Well, see, your daughter may be rebelling against you.
[01:57:27.486 --> 01:57:29.167]  It's all part of the sickness of America.
[01:57:29.227 --> 01:57:29.647]  Stay there.
[01:57:29.707 --> 01:57:31.428]  I'll talk to both of you on the other side.
[01:57:33.790 --> 01:57:38.672]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.551 --> 01:57:51.191]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.852 --> 01:57:52.933]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.613 --> 01:57:54.734]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.394 --> 01:57:56.215]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.956 --> 01:57:57.936]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.537 --> 01:58:02.319]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:06.842]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.103 --> 01:58:09.885]  We're talking to Jake in Tennessee.
[01:58:09.945 --> 01:58:12.246]  He's with his grandfather visiting for the summer.
[01:58:14.448 --> 01:58:18.651]  The boy's on Adderall.
[01:58:20.782 --> 01:58:23.383]  Because he's respecting his daughter's wishes and keeping him on it.
[01:58:24.864 --> 01:58:26.805]  You've got to be very careful when you come off those though.
[01:58:27.045 --> 01:58:35.190]  Basically, this is in the documents, they developed a bunch of mind control drugs and it's got the similar molecule structure to angel dust.
[01:58:36.130 --> 01:58:44.235]  In fact, it's classified in the, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors are classified as more dangerous than LSD.
[01:58:46.056 --> 01:58:48.277]  That is more toxic in their molecular structure.
[01:58:48.297 --> 01:58:50.238]  You should take a larger dose of LSD.
[01:58:51.748 --> 01:58:55.811]  It builds up in the brain, then it causes other problems and they always increase the dose.
[01:58:56.211 --> 01:58:59.173]  The average person on psychotropics in this country is on 4 drugs.
[01:59:00.354 --> 01:59:01.655]  The average foster child is on 7.
[01:59:03.055 --> 01:59:06.398]  Some Texas foster children are on as many as 17 drugs.
[01:59:07.118 --> 01:59:10.720]  The children after 10 drugs begin having seizures and they go on seizure medication.
[01:59:11.161 --> 01:59:12.822]  It's a form of eugenics.
[01:59:12.882 --> 01:59:16.844]  They actually murder the children in Texas and many other states with the drugs.
[01:59:17.124 --> 01:59:18.085]  It's a whole formula.
[01:59:19.175 --> 01:59:19.616]  I think so.
[01:59:34.984 --> 01:59:36.444]  And it's hardcore, folks.
[01:59:37.004 --> 01:59:38.265]  Hardcore.
[01:59:39.065 --> 01:59:46.226]  Friday, we're going to be having an hour and a half special, it's tomorrow, with Aaron Dyson here about how eugenicists went underground, what they set up.
[01:59:46.706 --> 01:59:50.347]  Going back to, what's your grandfather's first name, Jake?
[01:59:50.827 --> 01:59:51.107]  Bruce.
[01:59:51.807 --> 01:59:52.868]  Okay, Bruce.
[01:59:54.128 --> 01:59:59.709]  So, I mean, you guys are calling in and you're just telling me your grandson's on this and your daughter put him on it at five.
[01:59:59.969 --> 02:00:01.069]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:00:01.509 --> 02:00:03.770]  Well, he's not on it right now, not while he's with me.
[02:00:04.421 --> 02:00:09.783]  And I don't know what she was doing in the past.
[02:00:09.803 --> 02:00:12.344]  She said she hadn't given it to him starting this summer.
[02:00:12.564 --> 02:00:16.706]  We've been using some herbs to detoxify him and he has been making some progress.
[02:00:21.738 --> 02:00:22.839]  There's been a lot of symptoms.
[02:00:22.879 --> 02:00:24.841]  He can probably tell you some of the things that he feels.
[02:00:24.861 --> 02:00:26.222]  Well, let me just tell him something.
[02:00:26.643 --> 02:00:29.826]  You watch TV and it hypes your brain up even more.
[02:00:29.846 --> 02:00:34.470]  If you don't have good nutrition, Jake, they want you to get in trouble.
[02:00:34.991 --> 02:00:41.357]  They want you, you know, then they'll start picking on you and singling you out, especially when the school learns you're off drugs.
[02:00:41.617 --> 02:00:43.338]  They actually tell them to go after you.
[02:00:43.879 --> 02:00:45.741]  You beat them by being a good boy.
[02:00:46.201 --> 02:00:50.285]  You beat them every day when you get out of that concentration camp that's a public school.
[02:00:50.805 --> 02:00:53.267]  You beat them every day when they don't get you in prison.
[02:00:53.587 --> 02:00:58.571]  You beat them every day when you're clean-cut and do what your mother and father and grandfather say.
[02:00:58.892 --> 02:00:59.692]  You read books.
[02:00:59.792 --> 02:01:01.614]  You go hike around the woods.
[02:01:01.654 --> 02:01:02.775]  You find good friends.
[02:01:03.135 --> 02:01:04.036]  You get into sports.
[02:01:04.116 --> 02:01:05.697]  You don't play video games or watch TV.
[02:01:05.737 --> 02:01:09.781]  And you start doing push-ups every morning, seeing how many more you can do.
[02:01:10.041 --> 02:01:10.881]  You can build up to like 50.
[02:01:12.102 --> 02:01:13.504]  And let me tell you something.
[02:01:13.784 --> 02:01:15.125]  They want you to fail.
[02:01:15.780 --> 02:01:17.141]  Okay, they want you to be bad.
[02:01:17.581 --> 02:01:25.646]  So you win by being calm, by taking a deep breath, and realizing that Jesus loves you and that you're going to defeat them by being good.
[02:01:25.666 --> 02:01:29.949]  And you got a good grandpa getting you off this stuff.
[02:01:29.989 --> 02:01:30.670]  Anything else, Bruce?
[02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:32.491]  No, that's about it.
[02:01:32.591 --> 02:01:36.273]  I appreciate the kind words and I'm sure Jake will take them to heart.
[02:01:37.634 --> 02:01:39.435]  I mean, Jake, are you listening to your grandfather?
[02:01:39.455 --> 02:01:40.156]  Yep.
[02:01:40.836 --> 02:01:45.119]  I mean, do you realize that the government's run by criminals and they want to hurt you?
[02:01:45.797 --> 02:01:45.957]  Okay.
[02:01:45.977 --> 02:01:47.018]  It's called eugenics.
[02:01:47.078 --> 02:01:51.540]  If your grandpa has a computer, he can show you and maybe give you some lessons on that.
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:53.180]  Learning is actually fun.
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:55.121]  The stuff you get at public school isn't really learning.
[02:01:55.161 --> 02:01:55.982]  That's why you don't like it.
[02:01:57.182 --> 02:01:58.543]  Learning is actually fun.
[02:01:58.823 --> 02:01:59.483]  It's interesting.
[02:01:59.723 --> 02:02:02.764]  And I want you to find out about... Do you know who Adolf Hitler is?
[02:02:03.565 --> 02:02:04.365]  Yeah.
[02:02:04.505 --> 02:02:05.986]  Our government trained him.
[02:02:06.776 --> 02:02:07.296]  Okay?
[02:02:07.697 --> 02:02:10.318]  And in his book, Mein Kampf, he said he was trained by the U.S.
[02:02:10.378 --> 02:02:10.998]  and the British.
[02:02:11.478 --> 02:02:12.239]  Okay?
[02:02:12.379 --> 02:02:18.802]  And the same people that created Hitler run America, and they actually want to hurt you, Jake.
[02:02:18.982 --> 02:02:19.322]  Okay?
[02:02:19.803 --> 02:02:21.223]  So, understand that.
[02:02:21.624 --> 02:02:23.585]  You beat them by being strong.
[02:02:24.345 --> 02:02:30.608]  You beat them by growing up to be a strong, hard-working man who raises strong children yourself, and who loves his wife.
[02:02:31.549 --> 02:02:31.889]  Alright?
[02:02:32.509 --> 02:02:33.910]  So tell me that you're going to be a good boy.
[02:02:34.708 --> 02:02:35.929]  I'm gonna be a good boy.
[02:02:36.169 --> 02:02:36.449]  Good!
[02:02:36.729 --> 02:02:37.029]  Good!
[02:02:37.469 --> 02:02:44.972]  We'll be right back!
[02:02:46.613 --> 02:02:49.774]  It's here!
[02:02:49.954 --> 02:02:54.736]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:55.096 --> 02:03:02.719]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:03.433 --> 02:03:10.496]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.896 --> 02:03:22.321]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.621 --> 02:03:26.143]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.583 --> 02:03:28.504]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.844 --> 02:03:32.706]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:46.030 --> 02:03:46.791]  Terrorism!
[02:03:46.951 --> 02:03:47.691]  Terrorism!
[02:03:47.811 --> 02:03:53.855]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:03:54.135 --> 02:03:55.716]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:03:55.976 --> 02:03:58.438]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:58.818 --> 02:04:13.407]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:13.447 --> 02:04:13.767]  government.
[02:04:13.927 --> 02:04:15.708]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:04:16.108 --> 02:04:22.010]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:22.150 --> 02:04:26.651]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[02:04:45.603 --> 02:04:48.545]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:04:48.705 --> 02:04:53.928]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:04:54.228 --> 02:04:59.531]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:04:59.952 --> 02:05:01.052]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:01.433 --> 02:05:10.298]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[02:05:10.738 --> 02:05:12.340]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[02:05:52.013 --> 02:05:53.054]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.774 --> 02:05:54.895]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.536 --> 02:05:56.376]  You want answers?
[02:05:57.117 --> 02:05:59.038]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:59.058 --> 02:06:02.341]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.861 --> 02:06:07.004]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.045 --> 02:06:12.848]  The New World Order is making its move.
[02:06:13.809 --> 02:06:15.330]  We got our backs against the wall.
[02:06:15.370 --> 02:06:17.612]  They've drawn first blood a thousand times.
[02:06:18.012 --> 02:06:18.793]  We're fighting back.
[02:06:19.898 --> 02:06:20.758]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:06:22.339 --> 02:06:23.199]  Ted in New York.
[02:06:23.259 --> 02:06:23.879]  You're on the air.
[02:06:23.919 --> 02:06:24.379]  Go ahead.
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:28.940]  Hello, Ted.
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:29.780]  Come on down.
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:30.520]  You're on the air.
[02:06:30.540 --> 02:06:34.221]  Alright, he's got his radio on in the background.
[02:06:34.261 --> 02:06:34.861]  Let's let him go.
[02:06:35.301 --> 02:06:36.801]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:06:36.821 --> 02:06:37.662]  Where are you calling us from?
[02:06:38.302 --> 02:06:38.642]  Hey, Alex.
[02:06:38.662 --> 02:06:41.702]  I'm calling from West Bank, BC, Canada.
[02:06:41.822 --> 02:06:42.443]  Welcome, sir.
[02:06:42.883 --> 02:06:43.203]  Thank you.
[02:06:43.283 --> 02:06:44.203]  It's nice to be on your show.
[02:06:45.247 --> 02:06:46.448]  Question about Ron Paul.
[02:06:47.548 --> 02:07:06.397]  In the media they've been showing a lot of people are switching from being registered with Republican or Democrat to switch to Independent and I think that's something that needs to be addressed because from what I understand for Ron Paul to be nominated or to win the nomination he has to have Republican registered voters supporting him that way.
[02:07:06.437 --> 02:07:07.177]  Is that true?
[02:07:07.197 --> 02:07:08.398]  Is that being confirmed?
[02:07:09.545 --> 02:07:11.847]  Well, that's in the Republican primary.
[02:07:11.987 --> 02:07:18.513]  He needs people to register as Republicans so that they can vote for him in the primaries.
[02:07:18.573 --> 02:07:21.636]  But then in the general election, you can vote for whoever you want.
[02:07:22.096 --> 02:07:22.556]  I understand.
[02:07:22.897 --> 02:07:28.822]  So then the key to making sure he wins, you know, what are the keys?
[02:07:29.775 --> 02:07:35.759]  Like, for the American people to be able to contribute and help out with their voice that way, with their vote.
[02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:37.621]  Well, let me let you go and answer that question.
[02:07:37.641 --> 02:07:38.701]  It's a very good question.
[02:07:38.721 --> 02:07:40.082]  I mean, how do you win elections?
[02:07:40.162 --> 02:07:42.224]  Well, that's a whole ball of wax there.
[02:07:42.764 --> 02:07:45.867]  There's a million different angles to it, but basically this is how it works, okay?
[02:07:49.909 --> 02:07:53.952]  The media is not running real candidates.
[02:07:54.032 --> 02:07:56.134]  The government is not running real candidates.
[02:07:56.903 --> 02:07:59.445]  There is, at the top, no two parties.
[02:07:59.485 --> 02:08:02.387]  There's one party, and that's the Minions of the New World Order.
[02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:16.299]  And they are running McCain, Giuliani, all of these dead horses, in the race, by design, so that the Democrats can run unopposed.
[02:08:16.739 --> 02:08:21.663]  They just exchange power, they pass power like a baton,
[02:08:22.762 --> 02:08:25.384]  In a relay, and they're running a relay against us, the American people.
[02:08:25.784 --> 02:08:28.765]  And then they wrote books about it, and they brag about it, and we've got their own documents.
[02:08:28.865 --> 02:08:32.327]  It's Quigley, Georgetown documents, you've got them in the new older zone documents.
[02:08:32.387 --> 02:08:35.109]  It's just admitted, it's plain to see for anybody who watches.
[02:08:35.429 --> 02:08:42.333]  They vacation together, Fox News is behind Hillary, Murdoch, Roger Ailes, the Limbaugh's boss is behind Hillary, they're advising her.
[02:08:42.353 --> 02:08:44.014]  It's just, it's completely staged.
[02:08:44.814 --> 02:08:47.435]  Mary Madeline works in the White House, Carville works for the Democrats.
[02:08:47.475 --> 02:08:48.396]  I mean, they're married.
[02:08:48.914 --> 02:08:50.295]  I mean, it literally is a marriage.
[02:08:51.195 --> 02:08:52.136]  There's no better way.
[02:08:52.516 --> 02:08:58.959]  Like, they fight occasionally, and they squawk, but they got joint bank accounts, and they're in bed together in every way.
[02:08:59.079 --> 02:09:06.243]  And they have horrible little evil children called different agencies and different laws and abominations and tax schemes against us.
[02:09:07.924 --> 02:09:08.964]  It's a family of evil.
[02:09:09.384 --> 02:09:10.465]  They're a family.
[02:09:10.645 --> 02:09:11.906]  That's the only way you can describe them.
[02:09:18.547 --> 02:09:20.328]  So, first they tell you Ron Paul can't win.
[02:09:20.348 --> 02:09:21.168]  They try to ignore him.
[02:09:21.188 --> 02:09:22.949]  Then when they have to cover him, they say he's not going to win.
[02:09:22.969 --> 02:09:23.569]  He's a loser.
[02:09:24.810 --> 02:09:26.971]  And then he starts showing up at the polls.
[02:09:26.991 --> 02:09:28.571]  And these are even scripted polls.
[02:09:29.772 --> 02:09:33.433]  You know, where they know where to call certain areas, certain phone numbers, certain demographics.
[02:09:33.774 --> 02:09:35.154]  They've got computers that show this.
[02:09:36.815 --> 02:09:38.095]  They want to show a certain thing.
[02:09:38.596 --> 02:09:41.057]  Why, you know, he didn't show up at any of the polls.
[02:09:41.497 --> 02:09:46.139]  Then it turns out that, well, it was 57 different polls and he'd been included in three.
[02:09:47.139 --> 02:09:48.539]  And he showed up in all three?
[02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:51.340]  But with one percentage point?
[02:09:53.501 --> 02:10:11.745]  Well, yeah, I mean, if you don't include somebody in the polls, but you include other Republicans who are getting zeros, and you have the example of this taxpayer union of an Iowa, didn't invite Ron Paul, then he called and said, I want to come, and they said, no, you can't.
[02:10:11.985 --> 02:10:14.646]  Then they lied and said, oh, no, we never invited him, he just didn't call us.
[02:10:16.115 --> 02:10:19.116]  And then, of course, he has an event in which he has triple the people they do.
[02:10:20.436 --> 02:10:20.696]  Okay?
[02:10:20.716 --> 02:10:22.717]  There's no interest in the Republicans they're running.
[02:10:23.337 --> 02:10:26.397]  They're all a bunch of anti-gun, anti-America trash.
[02:10:27.498 --> 02:10:29.318]  Every one of them, except for Ron Paul.
[02:10:29.778 --> 02:10:30.518]  They're a joke!
[02:10:31.699 --> 02:10:35.679]  They're an absolute and complete joke compared to Ron Paul.
[02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:37.800]  And, uh...
[02:10:39.543 --> 02:10:43.708]  So they were telling you three, four, five months ago that McCain was the frontrunner, remember?
[02:10:43.988 --> 02:10:45.770]  That's because they knew he was an absolute dead duck.
[02:10:45.810 --> 02:10:46.971]  Republicans weren't going to vote for him.
[02:10:47.952 --> 02:10:50.255]  So they were telling you the weakest candidate was going to be the winner.
[02:10:51.116 --> 02:10:55.821]  And then when he kind of fell back, nobody bit into him, they weren't getting any traction on fooling people.
[02:10:56.041 --> 02:10:58.404]  They said, okay, it's Giuliani, and they put the penguin up there.
[02:10:59.099 --> 02:11:08.789]  And then everybody found out the Penguin was anti-gun, pro-abortion, pro-socialism, and on mafia connections, toll road, foreign company bankrolls.
[02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:11.612]  So his number started, firefighters came out and said, we hate him.
[02:11:12.228 --> 02:11:13.148]  So he starts plunging.
[02:11:13.508 --> 02:11:27.412]  And they go, okay, Fred Thompson, got serious cancer, never planning to run, can't even hardly give speeches, bumbling around, and then find out the Bush family's behind him, that came out in mainstream Tennessee news, they're bankrolling and all, just as a complete front.
[02:11:27.432 --> 02:11:30.033]  I mean, he might as well just work for Hillary, he probably does.
[02:11:30.653 --> 02:11:43.082]  Okay, so now he's out there to make you get excited about the party and play in the false left-right paradigm and, you know, go to the theater basically and have suspended disbelief and buy into it.
[02:11:44.243 --> 02:11:48.526]  And there's this dark horse spoiler, Ron Paul,
[02:11:49.791 --> 02:11:51.232]  Uh, that comes into the midst of this.
[02:11:51.273 --> 02:12:00.760]  He gets supercharged support right here in the Patriot community as a placenta, as an embryonic, uh, uh, nutrient center.
[02:12:01.401 --> 02:12:08.046]  We literally give him half a support, uh, in his first quarter of, um, the campaign.
[02:12:08.927 --> 02:12:13.871]  This show alone, I'm so proud of you guys and girls out there, everybody, all the people out there.
[02:12:14.872 --> 02:12:19.015]  And, uh, then he quadruples that.
[02:12:19.762 --> 02:12:24.104]  In the next phase, which isn't even over yet, goes supernova.
[02:12:24.124 --> 02:12:31.067]  100 times, he said on that Face the Nation with Stephanopoulos, 100 times what he thought he would get.
[02:12:31.087 --> 02:12:38.650]  I mean, even if he was getting 1% of the support he thought he would get, he would still be, in the growth rate, credible going into the election.
[02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:42.212]  He has now close to a year
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:45.501]  Okay, not quite a year.
[02:12:46.662 --> 02:12:49.903]  And with current growth rates, it is, he is assured.
[02:12:50.003 --> 02:12:52.244]  Okay, Las Vegas has said he is assured.
[02:12:52.284 --> 02:12:53.805]  Now, enter the wild card.
[02:12:53.845 --> 02:13:03.450]  We know in the big leagues that if there's big money arriving on something, they don't own the whole baseball team, but they own a few of the key people that are going to try to throw it.
[02:13:04.651 --> 02:13:09.353]  And we're seeing some really bad pitches.
[02:13:09.393 --> 02:13:13.415]  We're seeing a lot of people not hustle too hard to catch that
[02:13:14.395 --> 02:13:16.637]  Deep ball out in left field.
[02:13:19.098 --> 02:13:20.239]  That's the die-ball machines.
[02:13:20.259 --> 02:13:21.020]  That's the systems.
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:24.042]  And people say, well, how do we fight them then?
[02:13:24.142 --> 02:13:25.062]  Oh, we've got to give up.
[02:13:25.082 --> 02:13:26.483]  Well, if you're just going to give up, it's over.
[02:13:27.144 --> 02:13:32.747]  I mean, we've got to have such numbers where it shows that the exit polls show one thing in New Hampshire, but that this shows another.
[02:13:32.968 --> 02:13:34.949]  We have to continue the educational process.
[02:13:35.549 --> 02:13:38.151]  Just because it's a rigged game, we don't have a choice, folks.
[02:13:38.191 --> 02:13:40.793]  We've been thrown out here on the gladiatorial field.
[02:13:41.906 --> 02:13:44.887]  You got all the yuppies picking their noses and everything else up in the bleachers.
[02:13:45.647 --> 02:13:46.007]  Okay?
[02:13:46.287 --> 02:13:47.427]  But we're on the field.
[02:13:47.447 --> 02:13:48.268]  We're the American people.
[02:13:48.648 --> 02:13:50.848]  And we're out there with Ron Paul, who's our champion right now.
[02:13:51.688 --> 02:13:52.008]  Okay?
[02:13:52.028 --> 02:13:52.829]  He's a great champion.
[02:13:53.089 --> 02:13:54.109]  He's a good champion for us.
[02:13:54.529 --> 02:13:55.249]  Couldn't ask for better.
[02:13:56.029 --> 02:14:03.151]  Okay, he's a 74-year-old champion, out there, on the field, with their gladiator, who's got full armor, a huge battle axe, and a huge shield.
[02:14:03.871 --> 02:14:06.712]  And again, all Ron Paul's got's maybe a hammer, a club.
[02:14:07.192 --> 02:14:08.692]  It doesn't matter, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:08.913 --> 02:14:09.833]  We don't have a choice.
[02:14:10.053 --> 02:14:10.813]  We're on the field.
[02:14:11.970 --> 02:14:13.331]  Have you figured that out yet?
[02:14:14.071 --> 02:14:16.212]  We do not have a choice.
[02:14:16.232 --> 02:14:17.493]  They're coming down on us.
[02:14:17.813 --> 02:14:18.613]  They're pushing us.
[02:14:18.853 --> 02:14:19.714]  They're attacking us.
[02:14:19.934 --> 02:14:21.875]  They're pulling the social engineering on us.
[02:14:22.255 --> 02:14:23.816]  We have to fight them.
[02:14:24.236 --> 02:14:25.616]  And we have to fight back hard.
[02:14:27.497 --> 02:14:29.318]  And you don't just get behind Ron Paul.
[02:14:29.358 --> 02:14:32.280]  You get behind any other alternative candidates in your city or county.
[02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:33.120]  You need to run.
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:35.981]  Just so you can get the experience.
[02:14:36.021 --> 02:14:37.462]  Maybe you don't win the first three or four times.
[02:14:40.541 --> 02:14:42.642]  You go, you speak at all the candidate forum meetings.
[02:14:42.682 --> 02:14:43.822]  You speak in front of city council.
[02:14:43.842 --> 02:14:45.043]  You get a local access show.
[02:14:45.383 --> 02:14:47.764]  You call up, you get yourself on three or four local radio shows.
[02:14:47.804 --> 02:14:48.524]  They want guests.
[02:14:48.865 --> 02:14:51.006]  You get on there and you talk about issues while you're on there.
[02:14:52.446 --> 02:14:55.047]  Maybe some of you are middle class or wealthy and you got money.
[02:14:55.267 --> 02:14:56.528]  Put some of your own money into it.
[02:14:56.728 --> 02:14:57.828]  Your country needs you, folks.
[02:14:57.868 --> 02:14:58.569]  We're in deep trouble.
[02:14:59.429 --> 02:15:08.233]  But if we make a big showing and take action and get really aggressive, even if Ron Paul doesn't win but gets a lot of attention, the New World Order is going to think twice about martial law in FEMA camps.
[02:15:11.539 --> 02:15:13.760]  They're going to think twice about tyranny.
[02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:16.081]  They're going to think twice about completely tanking the dollar.
[02:15:16.501 --> 02:15:17.901]  They may leave a little value in it.
[02:15:18.061 --> 02:15:18.521]  Just a little.
[02:15:18.541 --> 02:15:20.482]  So you've got enough to live on, maybe.
[02:15:21.502 --> 02:15:30.466]  You see, if you give in to them and you just lay prostrate on your back and say, okay, you're going to rape me, go ahead and do it.
[02:15:31.206 --> 02:15:32.706]  Uh-uh.
[02:15:32.746 --> 02:15:33.707]  Then you're an easy target.
[02:15:33.987 --> 02:15:35.907]  Maybe the whole neighborhood is going to line up and rape us.
[02:15:36.348 --> 02:15:37.388]  No, we're going to fight.
[02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:40.592]  We're going to claw and scratch and kick and bite.
[02:15:40.632 --> 02:15:41.313]  We're going to do whatever.
[02:15:41.573 --> 02:15:43.054]  We're not going down without a fight.
[02:15:44.255 --> 02:15:49.400]  And folks, when you've got the attitude of you're not going down without a fight, you just get past your fear and go, you know what?
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:50.040]  I've turned loose.
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:50.921]  I'm not afraid anymore.
[02:15:51.181 --> 02:15:52.603]  I'm not worried about dying.
[02:15:52.823 --> 02:16:02.872]  I mean, I have to think about, hey, I'm not worried about dying or being in prison or being shut up, which those three things, there's a statistical probability that will happen to me, you know, someday.
[02:16:05.481 --> 02:16:06.342]  But I've just committed.
[02:16:06.362 --> 02:16:07.362]  I mean, it's worth it.
[02:16:07.943 --> 02:16:09.043]  I've made the decision.
[02:16:09.924 --> 02:16:12.186]  All you've got to worry about is your slack-jawed neighbor.
[02:16:13.126 --> 02:16:17.649]  Maybe you'll find out that bug-eyed neighbor actually cares and is afraid but never spoke out.
[02:16:17.869 --> 02:16:19.090]  They're weak followers.
[02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:23.013]  They need to see you lead first before they're going to stand up and become educated.
[02:16:24.514 --> 02:16:33.520]  You don't have as much to lose as I do, or as much to lose as Ron Paul does, or as much to lose as, well, who else is there, I guess, at that level.
[02:16:35.373 --> 02:16:36.233]  A few others, maybe?
[02:16:37.554 --> 02:16:38.094]  Who would they be?
[02:16:38.574 --> 02:16:40.835]  The point is... I mean, I'm asking.
[02:16:41.816 --> 02:16:43.156]  Who's more on the forefront?
[02:16:43.196 --> 02:16:43.657]  Ron Paul.
[02:16:44.037 --> 02:16:45.597]  He's at the tip of the spear now, folks.
[02:16:47.038 --> 02:16:47.938]  The very tip of the spear.
[02:16:49.399 --> 02:16:52.821]  And he said on air, yeah, he goes, yeah, it looks like I'm gonna get the nomination, you know.
[02:16:53.221 --> 02:16:55.822]  They killed this person, they shot that person, they did this, they did that, yeah.
[02:16:56.142 --> 02:16:57.042]  Yeah, they'll probably come after me.
[02:16:58.823 --> 02:17:00.144]  But that's just the way it is, folks.
[02:17:00.784 --> 02:17:03.125]  They blow Ron Paul away, and believe me, he knows that.
[02:17:04.224 --> 02:17:05.525]  I've talked to them off air, too.
[02:17:06.185 --> 02:17:08.226]  That'll just water the tree of liberty.
[02:17:08.526 --> 02:17:09.587]  We don't want that to happen.
[02:17:10.187 --> 02:17:11.268]  We want him to have security.
[02:17:12.908 --> 02:17:13.789]  But he doesn't right now.
[02:17:13.809 --> 02:17:15.069]  He just walks around openly.
[02:17:15.710 --> 02:17:16.550]  Shields down, ready.
[02:17:17.811 --> 02:17:18.351]  Just committed.
[02:17:20.012 --> 02:17:20.812]  You commit yourself.
[02:17:21.913 --> 02:17:22.993]  You just say, this is the way it is.
[02:17:23.033 --> 02:17:23.734]  I'm going to fight you.
[02:17:24.014 --> 02:17:24.494]  And let's go.
[02:17:25.755 --> 02:17:27.055]  You came here looking for a fight.
[02:17:27.816 --> 02:17:29.517]  You came here looking for war.
[02:17:29.537 --> 02:17:32.198]  You came here thinking you were going to take this country down.
[02:17:33.351 --> 02:17:37.219]  You think you're invincible, you bunch of chicken-neck technocracy twits?
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:38.702]  You're gonna lose!
[02:17:39.043 --> 02:17:39.504]  Period!
[02:17:46.451 --> 02:17:49.153]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[02:17:49.613 --> 02:17:51.894]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[02:17:52.194 --> 02:17:55.276]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[02:17:55.776 --> 02:17:57.917]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[02:17:58.077 --> 02:17:59.478]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[02:17:59.738 --> 02:18:03.841]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[02:18:04.181 --> 02:18:07.303]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[02:18:07.603 --> 02:18:08.823]  With more than 500 vital functions.

[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:14.882]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[02:19:15.042 --> 02:19:16.463]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[02:19:16.723 --> 02:19:18.805]  Dollars fall into 65% of Euro.
[02:19:18.945 --> 02:19:20.026]  Erosion accelerates.
[02:19:20.206 --> 02:19:22.748]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of U.S.
[02:19:22.928 --> 02:19:24.789]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.

[02:20:46.010 --> 02:20:48.971]  Where do you think one of the most toxic places on earth is?
[02:20:49.231 --> 02:20:50.492]  The answer may surprise you.
[02:20:50.672 --> 02:20:51.652]  It's in your body.
[02:20:51.912 --> 02:20:55.734]  The colon is a natural breeding ground for disease-producing germs.
[02:20:55.994 --> 02:21:00.135]  It may not sound like a very appealing subject, but it should not go ignored.
[02:21:00.275 --> 02:21:07.498]  For over a decade now, natural health expert Dr. Lauren Ritter has educated people everywhere about the benefits of internal cleansing.

[02:21:56.326 --> 02:22:02.271]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[02:22:02.411 --> 02:22:05.573]  But nobody wants to know him.
[02:22:06.013 --> 02:22:07.915]  They can see that he's just a
[02:22:09.753 --> 02:22:10.614]  Welcome back!
[02:22:10.714 --> 02:22:17.479]  Alright, let's go to, uh... Who's calling from Washington?
[02:22:17.519 --> 02:22:21.983]  Shirley, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:22:39.967 --> 02:22:41.328]  Alex, so good to hear you!
[02:22:41.348 --> 02:22:47.431]  Yeah, it sounds like I'm going to get an Academy Award here, but I would like to extend a few plaudits.
[02:22:47.772 --> 02:22:59.078]  Alex, my brother, first of all, to my future POTUS, Dr. Congressman, American Surgeon, Mr. Paul.
[02:23:00.339 --> 02:23:09.504]  He is so absolutely right about the military-industrial complex in the mafia is the medical and pharmaceutical professions.
[02:23:10.552 --> 02:23:16.336]  I would also like to tell Mrs. Sheehan, you go girl.
[02:23:17.757 --> 02:23:22.120]  And I know that nobody does this in public, but I would like to do it.
[02:23:22.660 --> 02:23:25.322]  One mom to another, if you will allow me, sir.
[02:23:26.823 --> 02:23:27.143]  May I?
[02:23:27.163 --> 02:23:29.205]  I don't know what you're going to do, but go ahead.
[02:23:29.905 --> 02:23:30.265]  Okay.
[02:23:30.465 --> 02:23:34.088]  Mrs. Sheehan, I am sorry you lost Casey.
[02:23:36.269 --> 02:23:38.811]  And I love you to bits.
[02:23:39.437 --> 02:23:40.437]  And you're a beautiful lady.
[02:23:40.838 --> 02:23:41.218]  Thank you.
[02:23:43.219 --> 02:23:47.881]  I would also like to say to Aaron Dykes, you're doing a wonderful job on eugenics.
[02:23:50.222 --> 02:23:57.905]  And I would also like to say to Jake that you don't let anybody mind control you, sweetheart.
[02:23:59.346 --> 02:24:08.170]  I grew up in the 50s in Michigan when Mengele and, you know, the whole Cameron
[02:24:09.705 --> 02:24:13.807]  And Mingley, we're going... That's right, Ewing Cameron for the U.S.
[02:24:13.827 --> 02:24:15.748]  government along with Mingley in the U.S.
[02:24:16.368 --> 02:24:18.929]  when the Nazi hunters chased him out, he went to Argentina.
[02:24:19.210 --> 02:24:21.431]  But it's on record, he was here running the operations.
[02:24:21.891 --> 02:24:22.971]  Sure he was.
[02:24:23.071 --> 02:24:24.672]  Very good government.
[02:24:24.852 --> 02:24:31.535]  I would like to say to Jake and his grandpa Bruce, you guys, you stand proud.
[02:24:31.816 --> 02:24:36.778]  Everything Alex said to you a half hour or so ago is so true.
[02:24:37.378 --> 02:24:38.899]  They want to hurt you, Jake.
[02:24:39.482 --> 02:24:42.644]  They want to hurt you, Grandpa Bruce, and you don't let them.
[02:24:43.105 --> 02:24:47.728]  You have your own self-esteem, and you stand proud.
[02:24:47.969 --> 02:24:53.893]  Everywhere in Scripture, our Father says, and I don't want to sound melancholic, you're dramatic.
[02:24:53.913 --> 02:24:55.955]  We're going to move on in a minute, so go ahead and finish up.
[02:24:56.755 --> 02:24:57.936]  Okay.
[02:24:58.096 --> 02:25:06.083]  I don't want to sound melancholic or dramatic, but I would like to tell Grandpa Bruce and Jake, you stand proud.
[02:25:06.143 --> 02:25:07.744]  You don't let anybody
[02:25:09.119 --> 02:25:10.980]  Make you think that you're less than you are.
[02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:12.841]  Well, that's what they do, and I appreciate your call.
[02:25:12.881 --> 02:25:13.802]  It's great to hear from you.
[02:25:14.763 --> 02:25:15.503]  No, that's what they do.
[02:25:15.523 --> 02:25:18.265]  And I mean, these are hardcore, dangerous drugs.
[02:25:18.985 --> 02:25:23.308]  Their molecules are more dangerous than the illegal narcotics and hallucinogens.
[02:25:23.808 --> 02:25:25.770]  But they give them and force them on our children.
[02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:29.612]  I mean, it's all out in the open here.
[02:25:29.652 --> 02:25:33.935]  We're going to be playing audio clips tomorrow where they brag about it, by the way.
[02:25:34.755 --> 02:25:36.576]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe.
[02:25:38.215 --> 02:25:38.775]  In Canada.
[02:25:38.795 --> 02:25:39.536]  You're on the air, Joe.
[02:25:40.936 --> 02:25:41.416]  Hi, Alex.
[02:25:41.536 --> 02:25:44.657]  Greetings from Edmonton, Alberta, in the Dominion of Canada.
[02:25:45.838 --> 02:25:46.118]  Welcome.
[02:25:46.138 --> 02:25:46.398]  Hello?
[02:25:46.418 --> 02:25:50.379]  Yeah, I was just saying, if I don't say welcome and you say hello, hello.
[02:25:50.659 --> 02:25:51.400]  So I said welcome.
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:53.761]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:25:53.801 --> 02:25:54.661]  No, and then you say hello.
[02:25:54.681 --> 02:25:55.061]  But it's okay.
[02:25:55.101 --> 02:25:58.642]  I'm just trying to... Then I get accused of interrupting, but I'm just letting you know you're on air.
[02:25:58.662 --> 02:25:58.962]  Go ahead.
[02:25:59.763 --> 02:26:00.323]  Oh, thank you.
[02:26:01.103 --> 02:26:03.124]  I just want to let you know that, um...
[02:26:03.860 --> 02:26:06.922]  I've been listening to your show now since August of 2006.
[02:26:08.383 --> 02:26:29.939]  At that time, by the way, before I actually discovered your show, I was increasingly awake to the New World Order, and after being a regular listener to your show for about the last 11 months, I am almost in the throes of getting together with my friends and organizing an educational group to wake up as many people, you know... Don't wait!
[02:26:29.980 --> 02:26:30.420]  Do it now!
[02:26:32.257 --> 02:26:35.459]  Actually, yeah, that's what I'm going to do right now.
[02:26:35.719 --> 02:26:45.326]  And I'm seriously considering starting a phone-in radio show to... Well, I wouldn't even do that, sir.
[02:26:45.367 --> 02:26:48.709]  I would start a website and then start an online radio show.
[02:26:48.729 --> 02:26:49.690]  Just do it online.
[02:26:50.450 --> 02:26:55.074]  You can add some phone-in thing if you want, but that's not... One hundredth is effective.
[02:26:56.775 --> 02:26:56.975]  Okay.
[02:26:57.015 --> 02:26:57.816]  But what do I know?
[02:26:58.457 --> 02:27:00.198]  I'm just saying, you might want to do it that way.
[02:27:01.563 --> 02:27:08.406]  I mean you know about the 360 and all those different sites that have the streams on them, I mean it's easy to do.
[02:27:09.166 --> 02:27:19.931]  Yeah, I just want to also add Alex, this morning I was feeling pretty upset with the way that Canada, the United States and the rest of the western world are going.
[02:27:21.454 --> 02:27:25.575]  Really cheesed off and upset with all the rudeness and the moral decay of society.
[02:27:25.615 --> 02:27:29.596]  Like, I was just about ready to throw a fit and throw things across the room.
[02:27:29.636 --> 02:27:30.096]  That's good.
[02:27:30.116 --> 02:27:30.896]  You need to get angry.
[02:27:30.916 --> 02:27:31.576]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.357 --> 02:27:37.258]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.758 --> 02:27:39.378]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.278 --> 02:27:42.979]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.778 --> 02:27:49.280]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:59.166]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[02:28:00.086 --> 02:28:06.890]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[02:28:07.791 --> 02:28:09.252]  Is this what Americans want?
[02:28:09.452 --> 02:28:12.514]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[02:28:13.487 --> 02:28:22.015]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:28:22.876 --> 02:28:24.437]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:28:24.457 --> 02:28:24.797]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:28:36.869 --> 02:28:37.510]  Call now.
[02:28:37.671 --> 02:28:44.242]  Operators are standing by to receive your order for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:28:46.337 --> 02:28:50.919]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:28:51.299 --> 02:28:54.240]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:28:54.561 --> 02:28:57.122]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:28:57.482 --> 02:29:02.304]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:29:02.684 --> 02:29:08.047]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:29:08.367 --> 02:29:11.328]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:29:11.508 --> 02:29:13.229]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[02:29:14.170 --> 02:29:18.893]  Many people believe that this will be the Mark of the Beast because of the restrictive measures included.
[02:29:19.073 --> 02:29:23.216]  Which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[02:29:23.516 --> 02:29:29.821]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the Mark of the Beast, it says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[02:29:30.141 --> 02:29:31.762]  It says, worship the beast.
[02:29:32.042 --> 02:29:34.644]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[02:29:34.924 --> 02:29:35.164]  We're good.
[02:29:46.653 --> 02:29:58.597]  JLS Research, the makers of the all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates that those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[02:29:58.757 --> 02:30:05.299]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[02:30:05.599 --> 02:30:12.982]  By using organic and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[02:30:13.322 --> 02:30:16.383]  As it responds, body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[02:30:16.663 --> 02:30:20.304]  First Responder is the first of its kind, comprised of only four organics.
[02:30:20.604 --> 02:30:24.005]  Grape seed skins, grape seed, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[02:30:24.265 --> 02:30:28.867]  It's so effective you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[02:30:29.207 --> 02:30:30.648]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[02:30:32.088 --> 02:30:34.270]  Go online and order First Responder at no-bo.com.
[02:30:34.310 --> 02:30:36.231]  Visit no-bo.com or call JLS Research at 850-723-8599.
[02:30:36.251 --> 02:30:36.491]  That's 850-723-8599.
[02:30:36.551 --> 02:30:39.293]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:39.333 --> 02:30:40.514]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:59.952 --> 02:31:00.893]  Alright, we're going to continue.
[02:31:00.913 --> 02:31:01.793]  Blessing for your calls.
[02:31:01.813 --> 02:31:02.934]  Hit some final news.
[02:31:02.954 --> 02:31:06.957]  We've got about 25 minutes in broadcast transmission time.
[02:31:06.977 --> 02:31:15.764]  Don't forget, we have a free podcast on the show each day that serves out free at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:31:15.784 --> 02:31:25.071]  Just click on the podcast button and then point and click and you can put it into your playlist of your MP3 or iPod or iPhone.
[02:31:27.172 --> 02:31:29.154]  And you can also, more importantly,
[02:31:29.853 --> 02:31:30.974]  You're obviously already listening.
[02:31:31.574 --> 02:31:40.860]  Tell your email list, your friends, your neighbors, your MySpace account, your message boards about, hey, listen to the Alex Jones Show, how you want, when you want, where you want, with a free podcast.
[02:31:41.240 --> 02:31:44.182]  Three hours each day, served out to you, free.
[02:31:47.165 --> 02:31:48.986]  Fast forward, rewind, go wherever you want.
[02:31:50.507 --> 02:31:52.328]  Also, we restream it because people want that.
[02:31:52.388 --> 02:31:53.508]  We pay for it.
[02:31:53.548 --> 02:31:55.169]  We send it out to you.
[02:31:55.189 --> 02:31:55.849]  21 hours a day.
[02:31:56.370 --> 02:32:03.393]  When the show ends at 2 o'clock central, 3 o'clock eastern, p.m., it restarts the show.
[02:32:03.433 --> 02:32:05.294]  You can listen at, say, 7 in the morning.
[02:32:05.314 --> 02:32:08.136]  You can listen at 9 o'clock at night.
[02:32:08.176 --> 02:32:08.776]  You can listen at
[02:32:09.346 --> 02:32:15.710]  Two in the morning, you can listen whenever you want, however you want, at InfoWars.com, not just when we're live.
[02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:24.356]  And also, this is the most important way to listen, AM or FM stations, because that's the number one way people listen in their cars or at work.
[02:32:24.996 --> 02:32:34.783]  And if you're listening to us in Tennessee on WBCR or KCXL in Kansas City or here in Austin, Texas, or on any of these stations, whether it was on KLVJ or Radio Free Austin,
[02:32:35.849 --> 02:32:40.352]  Uh, or stations in California, or stations in upstate New York, just all of our affiliates.
[02:32:40.372 --> 02:32:41.373]  I want to thank you, by the way.
[02:32:41.393 --> 02:32:47.978]  In fact, I had some big station in Texas call, but they wanted to talk to me before they put me on.
[02:32:48.298 --> 02:32:48.938]  That was two weeks ago.
[02:32:48.958 --> 02:32:50.119]  I'm so busy, I didn't call them back.
[02:32:50.359 --> 02:32:51.620]  I mean, I, I, I, by the way, that's nothing.
[02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:53.201]  I have all these friends and family calling me.
[02:32:53.241 --> 02:32:53.842]  I can't call back.
[02:32:54.483 --> 02:32:56.945]  And I have all these old-time friends calling and I can't call back.
[02:32:56.985 --> 02:33:01.028]  And I'm sorry that I haven't been calling a lot of people back or responding to stuff.
[02:33:01.289 --> 02:33:02.129]  People I even know.
[02:33:02.770 --> 02:33:05.452]  In fact, I always go see my grandmother at least once a week.
[02:33:05.512 --> 02:33:07.073]  I haven't been seeing her maybe once a month.
[02:33:07.473 --> 02:33:09.055]  So I'm trying to finish this endgame.
[02:33:09.075 --> 02:33:11.076]  It's just so important this information gets out.
[02:33:11.877 --> 02:33:15.760]  I mean, believe me, folks, I don't talk about this because I want you to go, oh, you're so great, you're so good.
[02:33:16.401 --> 02:33:21.865]  I want you to know I kind of flop around on air sometimes while I sound a little punch-drunk sometimes because I'm tired.
[02:33:22.751 --> 02:33:24.031]  I mean, it tears my heart out.
[02:33:24.491 --> 02:33:27.012]  I literally yearn to spend time with my family.
[02:33:27.692 --> 02:33:33.433]  I yearn to just go fishing and hiking and hunting.
[02:33:33.953 --> 02:33:50.957]  I just love to go out to some farmhouse for a month with a truck full of tents and guns and bows and arrows and oil paints and watercolors and toys and just hang out with my family.
[02:33:52.927 --> 02:33:54.868]  I literally dream about it all the time, folks.
[02:33:55.469 --> 02:33:56.670]  But I cannot stop.
[02:33:56.690 --> 02:33:59.332]  I don't think I'm even going to see my family today.
[02:33:59.352 --> 02:34:00.232]  I have to just stay here.
[02:34:00.252 --> 02:34:02.354]  And I'm going to do it.
[02:34:02.514 --> 02:34:04.355]  And I'm telling you because it's real, folks.
[02:34:05.036 --> 02:34:06.537]  They're going to bring in the troops.
[02:34:06.557 --> 02:34:07.858]  They're going to bring in the FEMA camps.
[02:34:07.898 --> 02:34:08.498]  They've built them.
[02:34:08.819 --> 02:34:09.899]  It's going to get real bad.
[02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:11.821]  We may be able to avert it.
[02:34:12.721 --> 02:34:14.943]  And that's why I'm doing what I'm doing.
[02:34:15.518 --> 02:34:26.821]  I mean, if things stabilize and the new order even slowed down to like Clinton era stuff, who I thought was the Antichrist, I don't mean literally, but figuratively, I would take a month off.
[02:34:26.881 --> 02:34:27.901]  I'm serious, folks.
[02:34:27.941 --> 02:34:29.382]  You'd hear guest hosts here and I'd be gone.
[02:34:29.402 --> 02:34:31.042]  Because I'm burned out.
[02:34:31.102 --> 02:34:31.682]  I'm tired of it.
[02:34:32.743 --> 02:34:35.243]  But I'm here because, man, we are right up on the edge.
[02:34:39.024 --> 02:34:39.625]  I mean, I'm serious.
[02:34:39.665 --> 02:34:41.005]  I just want to go be in the woods.
[02:34:43.664 --> 02:34:51.210]  I want to take long walks through the woods.
[02:34:51.891 --> 02:34:53.532]  I just want out of here.
[02:34:55.414 --> 02:34:56.935]  And it's depressing to me too.
[02:34:57.776 --> 02:35:04.141]  It's booing to see how good the American people are, and the people of the world that listen to this show, and how hard working the average people are.
[02:35:05.182 --> 02:35:06.583]  Then I just see the nature of power.
[02:35:07.504 --> 02:35:11.447]  That's why Ron Paul is so good, because he's got a lot of power, but he's really a humble good man.
[02:35:12.668 --> 02:35:14.509]  That's how people are attracted to him, too.
[02:35:14.549 --> 02:35:15.369]  He's scholarly.
[02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:16.550]  He's measured.
[02:35:19.511 --> 02:35:25.334]  But, uh, then I see people out there just in politics and culture.
[02:35:25.354 --> 02:35:35.259]  I actually get nauseous at trinkets and signets and logos of power and posing and dressed up.
[02:35:35.359 --> 02:35:37.460]  And I'm used to, I mean, I've never been against dressing up.
[02:35:37.500 --> 02:35:38.681]  It looks nice, put on a nice suit.
[02:35:38.721 --> 02:35:40.822]  But now I'm starting to really see it as bad.
[02:35:40.882 --> 02:35:41.182]  It's like a
[02:35:41.872 --> 02:35:44.072]  It's all part of haughtiness and fanciness.
[02:35:44.152 --> 02:35:48.293]  And I don't even know, I'm changing.
[02:35:48.893 --> 02:35:58.795]  And I've just gotten to the point, like I'm used to in our own movement, I try to have everybody on and build them up and try to energize everybody, but then still have them attack me because they're so jealous because I work harder than they do.
[02:35:58.815 --> 02:35:59.995]  I don't know why they're jealous.
[02:36:00.635 --> 02:36:02.336]  I'm at the front of the line to be cut down.
[02:36:03.256 --> 02:36:08.697]  And just in disgust, I've gotten to the point where I can't even stomach it anymore.
[02:36:09.457 --> 02:36:12.038]  You know, so I just go, you know what, just stay away from me.
[02:36:12.098 --> 02:36:13.838]  Just don't call me, don't talk to me.
[02:36:14.538 --> 02:36:16.178]  You know, I've told a lot of people that.
[02:36:16.298 --> 02:36:18.359]  And I'm not even saying these people are bad people.
[02:36:19.039 --> 02:36:20.159]  I just can't deal with it.
[02:36:20.339 --> 02:36:22.940]  Because they say you are what they are.
[02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:25.520]  You know, and I'm just telling you where my brain is at.
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:28.241]  It's the best of times, the worst of times.
[02:36:28.541 --> 02:36:32.122]  We're having great leaps against the New World Order.
[02:36:32.182 --> 02:36:34.542]  We are moving forward against the New World Order.
[02:36:34.562 --> 02:36:38.523]  You know, we are just exploding forward.
[02:36:39.705 --> 02:36:54.952]  But at the same time, I just, I get more and more discernment, frankly, and I understand more and more, and I learn more and more, and I study more and more, and I just, like, I can't stop studying, I can't stop learning, and then I get on air and I've got so much info, I can't even articulate it to you.
[02:36:55.492 --> 02:36:57.313]  I mean, it's just like, oh my gosh!
[02:36:58.053 --> 02:37:05.857]  How do you give somebody knowledge that's taken four or five hours of study intensely every day for 15 years?
[02:37:08.030 --> 02:37:10.551]  And I guess you gotta study the knowledge of how to deliver information.
[02:37:10.791 --> 02:37:11.891]  Maybe I'm not good at that, man.
[02:37:12.112 --> 02:37:14.492]  How to put it together in little nodules, little pieces.
[02:37:15.033 --> 02:37:16.593]  But then I understand propaganda.
[02:37:16.613 --> 02:37:18.414]  I know how the enemies pre-program people.
[02:37:18.914 --> 02:37:20.895]  And how they've changed semantical lexicons.
[02:37:21.235 --> 02:37:24.256]  And the use of words where we can't even communicate clearly with each other.
[02:37:24.556 --> 02:37:25.457]  Myself included.
[02:37:26.357 --> 02:37:27.998]  And I see all the conditioning I'm under.
[02:37:28.758 --> 02:37:30.719]  And then I see all of my faults too, by the way.
[02:37:30.739 --> 02:37:32.159]  It isn't just other people's faults I see.
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:37.061]  It's uh... It's an introspective, retrospective
[02:37:39.727 --> 02:37:41.308]  It's just so many things together.
[02:37:44.508 --> 02:37:59.533]  But I know this, we are part of history, and I love every single one of you that love liberty and freedom and righteousness and honor and decency and fairness and justice and beauty and good, goodly things.
[02:38:00.553 --> 02:38:04.535]  Because, I mean, I like good things.
[02:38:06.355 --> 02:38:08.716]  I like blue skies and green fields.
[02:38:09.617 --> 02:38:11.558]  I love to see people successful and happy.
[02:38:12.858 --> 02:38:14.539]  I rejoice in others' success.
[02:38:15.139 --> 02:38:16.220]  And I go back to this.
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:19.001]  That is the essence of being successful.
[02:38:19.381 --> 02:38:22.102]  That is the essence of being fulfilled and happy, I've discovered.
[02:38:23.542 --> 02:38:29.865]  And I never understood growing up what drove other people.
[02:38:29.885 --> 02:38:31.085]  It was confusing to me.
[02:38:31.606 --> 02:38:35.267]  And now I realize that the majority of people, and that is the majority,
[02:38:36.656 --> 02:38:52.860]  are governed not not nothing that's everything you are some of you out there but I mean you are governed by envy by enmity by jealousy by those things that make you feel inadequate I look at people's eyes they're so insecure
[02:38:54.176 --> 02:39:01.041]  They feel so unfulfilled when you can walk out on your porch at night and stare into the universe.
[02:39:01.401 --> 02:39:10.107]  You can look at hundred thousand year old light that left the face of stars millennia before Christ was even born.
[02:39:11.027 --> 02:39:11.668]  You can
[02:39:12.765 --> 02:39:20.107]  Travel into the mountains and wake up in the early morning with a hot cup of coffee and walk out to a field.
[02:39:20.147 --> 02:39:29.129]  You can just go right behind your house into the woods in spring and see little lizards on trees and all different varieties of flowers and clover.
[02:39:29.829 --> 02:39:34.590]  See, that's jewels to me, not the trinkets you'd fight and die for to hang around your neck.
[02:39:35.630 --> 02:39:39.291]  I mean, just the incredible design in a butterfly.
[02:39:39.875 --> 02:39:45.296]  Or in a deer, or in a fox I saw crossing the road when I was driving home at 3 in the morning last night.
[02:39:48.817 --> 02:39:53.078]  It's all around us, just the, just how beautiful women are.
[02:39:53.438 --> 02:39:54.518]  And it's not even sexual.
[02:39:55.459 --> 02:39:58.659]  Like growing up and being a teenager, I looked at women as sexual objects.
[02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:01.780]  I mean, why lie about it?
[02:40:02.458 --> 02:40:03.519]  That's the first way I look at a woman.
[02:40:03.559 --> 02:40:06.962]  Now I look at women, I think about their grandmothers and their ancestors.
[02:40:07.082 --> 02:40:09.124]  I see into them.
[02:40:09.244 --> 02:40:15.509]  I just marvel at the spark in their eyes, the fire in their souls.
[02:40:17.391 --> 02:40:18.732]  I can't even explain it anymore.
[02:40:19.253 --> 02:40:20.934]  And I see happy, strong people.
[02:40:20.994 --> 02:40:25.178]  I see the beauty of healthy, happy children, the light of God in their eyes.
[02:40:26.801 --> 02:40:32.327]  And then I see a shaved head, tattooed, huge-armed steroid cop stomping around.
[02:40:32.848 --> 02:40:37.473]  And literally, folks, he just rises up at me, and the alarms go off, and he goes, Enemy!
[02:40:37.593 --> 02:40:37.873]  Enemy!
[02:40:37.993 --> 02:40:38.294]  Enemy!
[02:40:38.414 --> 02:40:38.714]  Enemy!
[02:40:38.814 --> 02:40:39.114]  Enemy!
[02:40:39.235 --> 02:40:39.515]  Enemy!
[02:40:39.875 --> 02:40:40.156]  Enemy!
[02:40:40.176 --> 02:40:40.756]  Enemy of old!
[02:40:41.057 --> 02:40:42.178]  My very bones!
[02:40:42.238 --> 02:40:43.379]  My very ancestors!
[02:40:43.599 --> 02:40:44.580]  My very genetics!
[02:40:44.981 --> 02:40:46.422]  Everything tells me, Enemy!
[02:40:46.522 --> 02:40:46.823]  Enemy!
[02:40:46.923 --> 02:40:47.223]  Enemy!
[02:40:47.323 --> 02:40:47.624]  Enemy!
[02:40:47.704 --> 02:40:47.984]  Enemy!
[02:40:48.084 --> 02:40:48.384]  Enemy!
[02:40:48.465 --> 02:40:48.665]  Enemy!
[02:40:48.965 --> 02:40:50.186]  Enemy of those green fields.
[02:40:50.486 --> 02:40:51.687]  Enemy of those happy children.
[02:40:52.088 --> 02:40:57.111]  Enemy of those beautiful women whose true beauty is their minds and the love that they have to offer.
[02:40:57.972 --> 02:40:59.173]  And the nurturing spirit.
[02:41:00.754 --> 02:41:05.118]  And all around me I see the apparatchik to enslave our people and to hurt the innocents.
[02:41:06.164 --> 02:41:21.691]  That I learned of their plans, just laying coldly the plans to hurt society and enslave and do such despicable things because the elite are so envious and so jealous and so covetous of power that they would lay waste and dumb down entire populations.
[02:41:22.071 --> 02:41:32.096]  That they would take eugenics, not even according to their public claim of making the race better, which is a fraud itself, but to actually dumb down and enslave and control.
[02:41:32.116 --> 02:41:34.237]  It is so abominable.
[02:41:35.260 --> 02:41:43.809]  To take your very species and vandalize it, and to twist it, and to put to the sword 200 million souls.
[02:41:45.851 --> 02:41:54.800]  To have to watch the films of dead children in Russia, dead children in China, dead children in Nazi Germany, dead children in Latin America.
[02:41:55.675 --> 02:42:00.736]  To know they line up whole villages, it's going on right now, and blow babies' heads off.
[02:42:01.116 --> 02:42:04.917]  Throw babies live on top of their dead mothers who've been raped and shot.
[02:42:05.297 --> 02:42:11.239]  Right into three-foot graves and throw the baby in, still crying, laughing, and put dirt on top of them.
[02:42:11.739 --> 02:42:17.220]  I just want anybody with that spirit to know that we are going to get you.
[02:42:18.181 --> 02:42:23.122]  And your reign of terror and death and the stench of rotten flesh is going to end.
[02:42:24.093 --> 02:42:40.576]  Because whereas a lot of us love a good meal, and a crackling fire, and a good book, and to pet a trusted dog on the head, that's what makes my soul grow, not black uniforms, and piles of dead bodies, and the mindless exercise of power.
[02:42:42.116 --> 02:42:52.638]  We must defeat the New World Order, and we must ask God to guide us in that great task, and in that true work.
[02:42:54.241 --> 02:42:56.585]  And we must defeat evil with God's help.
[02:42:56.625 --> 02:42:58.147]  We must stand against it.
[02:42:58.228 --> 02:43:06.381]  If we won't stand, and if we won't be champions for God, and if we won't stand up for the light against the dark, then God will not move for us.
[02:43:07.771 --> 02:43:09.211]  You understand that, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:43:09.271 --> 02:43:12.172]  We have to put the faith into action.
[02:43:12.672 --> 02:43:14.993]  We have to pick up the shield and pick up the sword.
[02:43:15.353 --> 02:43:16.894]  We have to march out on the field.
[02:43:17.134 --> 02:43:21.235]  We have to face down your preacher who won't talk about the real issues.
[02:43:21.595 --> 02:43:26.977]  You have to bring people out of that church, find a real church for people to join.
[02:43:27.377 --> 02:43:28.517]  We have to get aggressive.
[02:43:29.170 --> 02:43:31.031]  We have to take back the institutions.
[02:43:31.531 --> 02:43:33.451]  We have got to go into the schools.
[02:43:33.471 --> 02:43:36.092]  We have to go into the government institutions.
[02:43:36.792 --> 02:43:37.773]  And we are doing that.
[02:43:37.793 --> 02:43:42.994]  That's why the City Council of Austin is going to basically ban public speaking now before them on any issue.
[02:43:43.014 --> 02:43:43.874]  They already restricted it.
[02:43:44.335 --> 02:43:46.455]  That's why the cops are saying you can't protest anywhere.
[02:43:46.495 --> 02:43:47.556]  You can't videotape them.
[02:43:48.576 --> 02:43:50.256]  Because they're already starting to get scared.
[02:43:50.276 --> 02:43:51.417]  And I wish they weren't scared.
[02:43:52.617 --> 02:43:58.699]  I wish they were still haughty and arrogant like they were just a year or two ago while our forces grew.
[02:43:59.717 --> 02:44:06.579]  Now they're more dangerous because the enemy is really starting to feel their power slip and they already know they're going to be defeated.
[02:44:07.019 --> 02:44:09.820]  Which is going to make them that much harder to beat, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:10.540 --> 02:44:14.841]  And they'll get their world government, they're going to kill a whole bunch of us, but in the end they're going to lose.
[02:44:14.881 --> 02:44:15.822]  You have to understand that.
[02:44:16.482 --> 02:44:17.362]  That's the victory.
[02:44:18.442 --> 02:44:27.625]  And you have to know that right when you think nothing can stop them, and right when you think they've got total monopoly of power, is the moment that they are actually falling.
[02:44:31.798 --> 02:44:34.441]  I said I'd take your calls, I don't even know anymore.
[02:44:34.461 --> 02:44:38.104]  I don't even know anymore.
[02:44:41.667 --> 02:44:44.170]  You know, I get tired, I get irritable, I get nasty too.
[02:44:47.052 --> 02:44:49.074]  But the key is, I'm trying to be a good person.
[02:44:51.857 --> 02:44:57.642]  And I'm just in a mode of, from hell or high water, we gotta fight these people.
[02:45:00.532 --> 02:45:02.572]  We've got to fight them 110%.
[02:45:03.733 --> 02:45:05.133]  We don't have a choice.
[02:45:05.173 --> 02:45:06.133]  You're under attack.
[02:45:06.173 --> 02:45:08.354]  The war has already begun.
[02:45:09.134 --> 02:45:10.454]  Why stand we here idly?
[02:45:12.015 --> 02:45:13.255]  Our brothers are in arms.
[02:45:14.175 --> 02:45:18.936]  The next gale from the north will bring with it the resounding clash of arms.
[02:45:24.317 --> 02:45:25.818]  I don't know what course you're going to take.
[02:45:25.858 --> 02:45:27.678]  I don't know what you're going to do.
[02:45:29.491 --> 02:45:32.132]  But if you're not going to join us, just go from us in peace.
[02:45:33.013 --> 02:45:36.294]  Just at least get your smile and yuppie face out of my face.
[02:45:37.075 --> 02:45:38.875]  Just forget that we were your brethren.
[02:45:39.816 --> 02:45:41.897]  And may your chains sit lightly on you.
[02:45:41.937 --> 02:45:42.837]  May they be comfortable.
[02:45:44.698 --> 02:45:45.458]  But they won't be.
[02:45:45.538 --> 02:45:49.100]  Bondage is not a happy lot.
[02:45:49.940 --> 02:45:57.724]  And so many throughout history who do go into bondage later wish that they would have stood up.
[02:45:58.450 --> 02:46:00.271]  That they would have gotten involved.
[02:46:01.011 --> 02:46:02.552]  That they would have spoken out.
[02:46:02.993 --> 02:46:04.614]  We can change history now.
[02:46:04.694 --> 02:46:06.154]  It's not a foregone conclusion.
[02:46:06.515 --> 02:46:09.156]  We can be given the reprieve like Nineveh.
[02:46:10.737 --> 02:46:12.938]  But that doesn't even matter in the final equation.
[02:46:12.978 --> 02:46:14.039]  It's doing the right thing.
[02:46:14.419 --> 02:46:26.526]  If you won't fight evil, and if you won't push yourself in the way of the sword for the little ones that are being abused by this system, if you won't in this life
[02:46:27.768 --> 02:46:30.751]  Do the right thing, my friends, you won't ever partake of the next.
[02:46:34.734 --> 02:46:43.402]  You're not alive until you submit yourself to the will of God.
[02:46:44.623 --> 02:46:54.251]  You are not alive until you step into the stream of humanity's great existence and humanity's immortality.
[02:46:56.431 --> 02:47:11.382]  An immortality that is threatened by this elite who seeks with the genetic engineering to destroy and break the very mole, the very fount from which we flow.
[02:47:14.404 --> 02:47:17.226]  Our ancestors are alive in space and time forever.
[02:47:18.226 --> 02:47:20.928]  We're alive in space and time now forever.
[02:47:22.009 --> 02:47:23.230]  And our progeny
[02:47:24.622 --> 02:47:35.948]  Must have a chance to go on into the future without a pack of scum, a pack of control freaks, a pack of devils having their way.
[02:47:36.669 --> 02:47:43.972]  We'll come back with a final segment with some final news items, maybe a caller, so stay with me.
[02:47:44.613 --> 02:47:53.057]  Bobby found a diesel dam just before it rained and rode us all the way into New Orleans.
[02:47:55.257 --> 02:47:59.541]  I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana.
[02:47:59.621 --> 02:48:03.904]  I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues.
[02:48:04.364 --> 02:48:10.469]  When she walked through Serpentine, I told her, Bobby's a handyman.
[02:48:11.050 --> 02:48:13.852]  We sang every song that Javi knew.
[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:17.540]  I don't think so.
[02:48:49.551 --> 02:48:49.992]  It's here.
[02:48:50.212 --> 02:48:54.981]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:55.341 --> 02:49:02.995]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.672 --> 02:49:10.734]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:11.135 --> 02:49:22.558]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.858 --> 02:49:26.540]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.820 --> 02:49:28.760]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:29.081 --> 02:49:32.942]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
