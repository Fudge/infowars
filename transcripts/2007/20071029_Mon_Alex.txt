[00:00:04.585 --> 00:00:05.245]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:06.986]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.746]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:10.226]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.987 --> 00:00:11.887]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:16.428]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:20.849]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.452]  Well, I had a very busy weekend doing Coast to Coast AM with Ian Ponnett and my own Sunday show.
[00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:35.552]  4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:35.572 --> 00:00:36.353]  that we've syndicated.
[00:00:36.373 --> 00:00:44.019]  And so I missed my emails and phone calls that I got from 9-11 We Are Change LA.
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.382]  WeAreChangeLA.org.
[00:00:47.362 --> 00:00:49.044]  But the early worm gets the worm.
[00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:52.847]  The early bird was up at about 630 this morning.
[00:00:53.728 --> 00:00:56.090]  And I did get the news and the information then.
[00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.792]  And so we have the folks for you.
[00:00:59.244 --> 00:01:02.607]  They are going to be getting the video up today or tomorrow.
[00:01:02.647 --> 00:01:07.271]  They shot it in high def and are trying to convert it and get it up on the computer and I've learned what a hassle that is in Learning Curve.
[00:01:08.632 --> 00:01:11.134]  But, huge news!
[00:01:11.174 --> 00:01:12.876]  They got an interview with Martin Sheen.
[00:01:14.437 --> 00:01:19.282]  That's right, Charlie Sheen's father, who's been outspoken on the war.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.580]  We're good to go.
[00:01:47.276 --> 00:01:57.222]  He also has a well-known actor's son, Emilio Estevez, and our good friend Charlie Sheen, who really broke the ice on 9-11 Truth.
[00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:11.510]  Well, Saturday at an anti-war rally in Southern California, we are Change Los Angeles, went up and did an interview with him on camera.
[00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:34.951]  In fact, the fellow that you see in the different We Are Change LA videos that have been put up, in the response to Bill Maher, the challenge to Bill Maher, with his co-anchor, being the young lady who we've interviewed before up at Get Herd On, lovely, intelligent young lady, Stuart Howe is her co-host, and he did the interview.
[00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:37.353]  And that was Saturday evening.
[00:02:38.234 --> 00:02:39.315]  It should be up today.
[00:02:39.355 --> 00:02:41.276]  They're working on it right now.
[00:02:43.752 --> 00:02:58.177]  And let me just say that we are going to, not play down what he said, but because the video isn't out yet, we may even get the audio for later in the show today, that we're going to be very conservative with quoting him in absentia.
[00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:08.341]  There was another well-known actor there, Mark Ruffalo, was with him.
[00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.811]  And they were asked questions about the fall of Building 7.
[00:03:12.331 --> 00:03:14.972]  They were asked questions about the NORAD stand down.
[00:03:16.273 --> 00:03:21.815]  They were asked questions about the police state that has grown out of 9-11.
[00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:30.338]  And we will tell you what they said and the words of talking to Stuart Howe right before air time and earlier this morning.
[00:03:31.304 --> 00:03:48.583]  That it's, quote, even more powerful than that, but we're going to wait for the really powerful stuff until the video is out, but there will be articles on PrisonPlanet.com and TruthNews.us in the next couple hours, maybe even sooner at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:48.623 --> 00:03:50.405]  I know Curt Nemo is on it right now at TruthNews.us.
[00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.610]  I know Paul Watson already did an article this morning.
[00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.431]  George Carlin questions received reality.
[00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:03.253]  He says, you know, that they brought up Bill Maher being confronted and the official story of 9-11 to him at a book signing.
[00:04:03.293 --> 00:04:06.994]  And he said, yeah, well, I always, they said, do you question the 9-11 story?
[00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:09.115]  And he said, well, yeah.
[00:04:10.315 --> 00:04:14.077]  In fact, I forgot to tell you, John, go grab that audio from We Are Change New York.
[00:04:15.037 --> 00:04:16.497]  And let's air that later with Carlin.
[00:04:17.498 --> 00:04:17.758]  Please.
[00:04:18.777 --> 00:04:21.779]  Headline, George Carlin questions received reality.
[00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.100]  And he goes on to the question of, do you question people's story?
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.963]  He goes, yeah, well, I always question the received reality, because a lot of times it turns out to be not true or a lie.
[00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:34.105]  And then he went on and said even more.
[00:04:34.185 --> 00:04:40.389]  So coming up, what George Carlin had to say, but first, what Martin Sheen had to say.
[00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:42.870]  Again, this is huge.
[00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:48.293]  And I've tried to put in a call to Charlie Sheen this morning, but it's early out there.
[00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:51.490]  I'm gonna try to get his take on all this, too.
[00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.311]  And, uh, this was, again, already breaking on some of the message boards in places out there.
[00:04:56.971 --> 00:04:59.652]  So, um, we're covering it before Fox spins it.
[00:05:00.812 --> 00:05:02.193]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:02.213 --> 00:05:04.333]  A new world order.
[00:05:05.053 --> 00:05:09.515]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:09.955 --> 00:05:11.695]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[00:05:12.776 --> 00:05:15.016]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:15.556 --> 00:05:17.957]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:18.727 --> 00:05:26.057]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:29.068 --> 00:05:34.072]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:34.572 --> 00:05:38.014]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:40.916]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:40.956 --> 00:05:42.097]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:42.137 --> 00:05:42.898]  They're not after money.
[00:05:42.918 --> 00:05:43.978]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:44.939]  They're after power.
[00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:46.180]  That's what they're after.

[00:07:06.188 --> 00:07:08.950]  A tool that helps relieve the pain and doesn't just treat the symptoms.
[00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.431]  You need the SacroEggie Sacral Stabilizer.
[00:07:11.771 --> 00:07:15.333]  One satisfied user states, I don't believe in gadgets, but this is a miracle.
[00:07:15.493 --> 00:07:16.314]  Yes, that's right.
[00:07:16.354 --> 00:07:21.357]  Just relax 20 minutes daily or when needed to help correct the muscle imbalance that creates many of these symptoms.
[00:07:21.557 --> 00:07:25.239]  Gravity does the work with the SacroEggie under the sacrum and support under your neck.
[00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:27.481]  Help correct posture to help relieve the pain.
[00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:28.922]  We're good to go!
[00:08:01.378 --> 00:08:07.402]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.022 --> 00:08:11.063]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.705 --> 00:08:25.151]  Twenty minutes before air time, I've been talking to him all morning, I had a chance to speak to one of the individuals who went into Bill Maher's little production and
[00:08:27.134 --> 00:08:31.819]  Exposed the fact that 9-11 is an inside job two Fridays ago.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.781]  He is Stuart Howell.
[00:08:34.702 --> 00:08:45.834]  His co-host is Katie Kurtzman, who we interviewed last week, last Monday, concerning their confrontation with Bill Maher that got international headlines as one of the biggest stories in the news cycle last week.
[00:08:50.248 --> 00:08:57.895]  Earlier this morning, they were trying to get up the guys that shot the video that had the tape, because it was early out there, so that they could at least get us the audio.
[00:08:58.635 --> 00:09:05.061]  And they are busily, right now, uploading the audio.
[00:09:05.261 --> 00:09:13.268]  During the break, I'll multitask and find out exactly where, so we can link to it and post it in an article for PrisonPlanet.com and TruthNews.us.
[00:09:13.308 --> 00:09:14.449]  I mean, this is a newsroom.
[00:09:14.689 --> 00:09:17.812]  When you're listening to this show on these big news days, you hear it happening.
[00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:27.370]  Because I'm, you know, the reporter, the talk show host, the editor, and I'm working with all these great people in the field, these wonderful activists like We Are Change Los Angeles.
[00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.070]  And I love what We Are Change was born out of.
[00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:43.773]  They were born out of folks in New York, establishment leftists and others, trying to censor and control what the young activists and what people in the community wanted to do, getting more aggressive against the New World Order agenda and exposing government-sponsored terror.
[00:09:45.442 --> 00:09:50.683]  And I challenged Luke Radowsky to start We Are Change, to be a young leader in all this, to take action, and he did it.
[00:09:51.063 --> 00:09:52.923]  And chapters are sprouting up everywhere.
[00:09:52.963 --> 00:09:57.424]  We Are Change is confronting politicians and power brokers every day across the world.
[00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:02.485]  These young info warriors and old info warriors are just wonderful, wonderful people.
[00:10:03.706 --> 00:10:10.827]  But since then, we don't even have to paraphrase what Martin Sheen was saying, because they just listened to the audio this morning and did some
[00:10:13.271 --> 00:10:23.938]  Quick transcripts of basically what Martin Sheen, legendary actor, television and of course the stage and screen in several Academy Award winning films.
[00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:30.963]  His son was the first big Hollywood star and it went supernova because people resonated with what he did.
[00:10:31.003 --> 00:10:36.387]  The courage of Charlie Sheen, the first big Hollywood star to go public a year and a half ago.
[00:10:37.467 --> 00:10:43.429]  In April, April 20th of 2006, that became a huge national story for weeks.
[00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:46.391]  In fact, the last year and a half, it's been in the news every other week.
[00:10:46.911 --> 00:10:48.411]  He was viciously attacked for it.
[00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:51.012]  I want to make something clear about what you're about to hear from Martin Sheen.
[00:10:51.312 --> 00:10:52.853]  The audio is coming later during the show.
[00:10:54.174 --> 00:10:57.515]  Also, the video should be up later today.
[00:10:59.136 --> 00:10:59.756]  And that's this.
[00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:05.138]  Martin was asked about what he thought about Building 7 mysteriously falling, and he said,
[00:11:06.653 --> 00:11:09.657]  It's suspicious what happened with the main towers, not just Building 7.
[00:11:09.937 --> 00:11:15.804]  And I want to make something clear before Fox News and the rest of them attack you.
[00:11:16.284 --> 00:11:18.387]  And that's why we're writing an article that focuses on this.
[00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:27.317]  Just two weeks ago, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the big federal body that studies technology and standards, and vets, patents, and all of this,
[00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:31.868]  ...said, okay, we don't know why Tower 1 and 2 and 7 fell.
[00:11:31.908 --> 00:11:35.090]  It is very mysterious, and fires shouldn't have been able to do that.
[00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.491]  The planes crashing into them shouldn't have been able to do that.
[00:11:39.692 --> 00:11:52.957]  This is Martin Sheen, Charlie Sheen, and others, just having the courage to say the world is round, and that the universe doesn't orbit the Earth before anybody else says it, at their prominent level.
[00:11:55.965 --> 00:12:02.408]  We also have George Carlin being questioned over the weekend at a book signing about 9-11 being a cover-up.
[00:12:02.708 --> 00:12:04.169]  And does he think there could be a cover-up?
[00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:07.730]  And he said, I always question the received reality.
[00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:13.513]  And he said, if they had another investigation, it'd be a total whitewash because the government covers up what it does.
[00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:15.634]  I mean, tacit 9-11 truth statement.
[00:12:16.014 --> 00:12:17.155]  Very, very strong.
[00:12:17.415 --> 00:12:19.656]  PrisonPlanet.com story right now.
[00:12:19.796 --> 00:12:20.856]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:12:22.677 --> 00:12:24.618]  I am so excited, but I just want to say to Adam,
[00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:26.650]  Any other guys right now?
[00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.211]  I'm tempted just to go to music right now and call Adam and just tell him.
[00:12:30.231 --> 00:12:31.792]  You know, it's a big crowd of people.
[00:12:31.832 --> 00:12:33.692]  They're up on stage after the anti-war rally.
[00:12:34.172 --> 00:12:35.732]  There's folks interjecting questions and things.
[00:12:35.752 --> 00:12:38.753]  They're trying to cut those out so it's just what Martin Sheen was saying.
[00:12:39.913 --> 00:12:48.476]  But I just say get it out as quickly as possible because Fox and others are already on this because I guess you guys couldn't get a hold of me yesterday and ABC's already on this.
[00:12:49.796 --> 00:12:54.317]  Couldn't get a hold of me yesterday because I slept till late because I was on coast to coast till five in the morning and then I
[00:12:55.157 --> 00:13:03.422]  Didn't get to sleep until about 6, and then I got up about 11, and I went and did my radio show, and I apologize, but they saw it on message boards, they know about it, they're preparing their propaganda push.
[00:13:03.862 --> 00:13:11.486]  We have got to just point out that Martin Sheen, to protect him, folks, so more will come forward, and so he doesn't get squashed.
[00:13:13.027 --> 00:13:15.889]  We have to point out he's only stating what NIST is saying.
[00:13:16.517 --> 00:13:18.258]  Why is that such an abomination?
[00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:19.539]  Why is that heresy?
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:30.708]  Okay, going to Stuart Howe right now, who was in there confronting Bill Maher, who went and did the interview, of course, with Martin Sheen, Saturday afternoon in Los Angeles.
[00:13:30.748 --> 00:13:32.189]  Thank you so much for coming on, sir.
[00:13:32.769 --> 00:13:33.350]  My pleasure.
[00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:34.150]  Thanks for having me.
[00:13:34.611 --> 00:13:41.456]  Now, in the 20 minutes since we talked before airtime, you were able to get a hold of Adam and have him play you some of the audio clips to get quotes.
[00:13:41.516 --> 00:13:43.017]  First, set the table for us.
[00:13:43.618 --> 00:13:46.180]  You interviewed Martin Sheen and another well-known actor.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:46.980]  How did this happen?
[00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:48.021]  Tell us what they said.
[00:13:48.542 --> 00:13:53.225]  Well, first I need to clarify, if I can take a minute, I actually was not inside the Bill Maher Show.
[00:13:53.265 --> 00:13:55.067]  That was done by other members of our group.
[00:13:55.727 --> 00:13:59.589]  I was the gentleman who was on screen with Katie Kirchman in the response video.
[00:13:59.609 --> 00:14:00.629]  That's right.
[00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.651]  So you were in the video response to it, to be clear, but you're with We Are Change LA.
[00:14:04.731 --> 00:14:05.511]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:14:05.591 --> 00:14:06.192]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:07.852]  Yeah, well, we were there.
[00:14:07.892 --> 00:14:20.398]  We were at the Answer March, and we had a little booth set up to try to get the truth out about 9-11, as we're trying to do, and it became clear that there's a lot of people around we would want to talk to, and Adam came and grabbed me and
[00:14:20.785 --> 00:14:24.046]  We went and found Mr. Sheen and he's a really nice guy.
[00:14:24.066 --> 00:14:32.310]  I should lead in by telling you he's a genuinely nice guy and I want to be very careful because of that that I don't state anything that isn't accurate.
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:52.613]  You know, I was running on lack of sleep and very tired, and we had also interviewed Mark Ruffalo, so I may have been a little bit confused about which said what, but I do have some transcripts, and it was very exciting because he's on board, he wants to help, and he's a patriot, and, you know, we're all trying to do the best thing for our country, and it just felt good knowing he was on board with that.
[00:14:52.793 --> 00:14:53.613]  Absolutely!
[00:14:53.633 --> 00:14:54.554]  Go over it.
[00:14:55.334 --> 00:14:59.397]  Well, you know, I kind of let in with, you know, that we have a problem here, and
[00:14:59.844 --> 00:15:08.947]  You know, there was a question if he was aware that the official story didn't ring true and what we could do to help the situation.
[00:15:09.827 --> 00:15:12.168]  He replied with, I don't know what to suggest.
[00:15:12.188 --> 00:15:13.628]  There were a lot of questions about it.
[00:15:14.168 --> 00:15:19.009]  He pointed out that his son Charlie had introduced him to a lot of information and that there were a lot of questions.
[00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:24.231]  Up until last year, about a year ago, he said he had been very dubious
[00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:35.016]  But he said, and I quote, he said, I do not want to believe, I did not want to believe that my government could be involved in such a thing and that none of us wanted to believe that, I said.
[00:15:35.496 --> 00:15:38.838]  And then he went on to say that I could not live in a country that I thought could do that.
[00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.960]  That would be ultimate, the ultimate betrayal.
[00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:48.724]  And then he said, then however, there have been so many revelations that now I have my doubts.
[00:15:49.225 --> 00:15:50.966]  And chief among them is Building 7.
[00:15:51.926 --> 00:15:53.267]  How did they rig that building?
[00:15:53.683 --> 00:15:56.584]  So that it came down on the evening of that day.
[00:15:57.764 --> 00:15:58.324]  And he went on.
[00:15:58.344 --> 00:16:03.046]  He was just kind of candid, and he wasn't claiming to know anything specifically.
[00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:06.187]  It was just more, you know, that a lot of questions were raised.
[00:16:06.207 --> 00:16:17.650]  For the record, now that you've had a chance to hear it again, because I know I woke you up at 6 in the morning your time, 8 in the morning my time, here at Central, was that his quote about you asking about 7?
[00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.551]  He said, well, the other two towers were suspicious, or was that Ruffalo?
[00:16:20.831 --> 00:16:27.633]  That may have been Ruffalo, and I have not heard or seen any of that since we shot it, and it was kind of a chaotic time when we shot it.
[00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:33.974]  But, but, but, we're about to, because Fox News, all these enemies of freedom are listening right now, so they can't spin.
[00:16:34.735 --> 00:16:39.396]  How long, and I, I mean, I'm sure it's going to be, what, on WeAreChangeLA.org soon?
[00:16:39.696 --> 00:16:47.138]  Yeah, hopefully it's going up as we speak, in a rough cut, and, you know, it's going to, hopefully it's up there as we speak, and it's about to be polished up a bit.
[00:16:48.047 --> 00:16:54.893]  And of course Murphy's law would have it that if you got shot in high def, then that is harder to transfer onto these web formats.
[00:16:55.313 --> 00:16:59.796]  Please continue with any other of the quotes you were able to get directly from the audio.
[00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:01.017]  Yeah, absolutely Alex.
[00:17:01.858 --> 00:17:07.262]  I asked him if he was referring to the Larry Silverstein statement about pulling it.
[00:17:07.763 --> 00:17:09.724]  With Building 7, and he said, yeah, pull it.
[00:17:10.245 --> 00:17:10.985]  How convenient.
[00:17:11.706 --> 00:17:13.087]  When did they rig that building?
[00:17:13.828 --> 00:17:15.429]  And, you know, it just was
[00:17:16.673 --> 00:17:17.133]  It was good.
[00:17:17.173 --> 00:17:18.314]  I mean, he had a lot of questions.
[00:17:18.354 --> 00:17:22.298]  He pointed to, basically, what's out there as the truth.
[00:17:22.358 --> 00:17:25.100]  That there's questions, there's a Silverstein statement.
[00:17:26.961 --> 00:17:30.644]  And he's trying to get to the truth of it, and it was nice to feel that he was on board.
[00:17:31.004 --> 00:17:38.831]  And I don't think he's making any assumptions, but I think he's aware and he's concerned, and it was great to have him on board with us.
[00:17:40.052 --> 00:17:41.953]  What about the NORAD standout?
[00:17:42.133 --> 00:17:42.954]  Can you get into that?
[00:17:43.573 --> 00:17:45.495]  Yeah, let me see where my notes are on that.
[00:17:45.515 --> 00:17:46.415]  Yeah, you know what?
[00:17:46.455 --> 00:17:47.476]  Just read through all your notes.
[00:17:47.516 --> 00:17:48.397]  I think that's the best way.
[00:17:48.577 --> 00:17:49.518]  I'm pretty much done with them.
[00:17:49.598 --> 00:17:54.482]  I actually had to take your call when I was about, you know, about at that point with taking notes from Adam.
[00:17:54.822 --> 00:18:08.433]  You know, he did say, yeah, NORAD, that's questionable, the response was questionable, or alluded to the fact that, you know, he agreed with me that I thought it was questionable, but he did say, you know, it was the military involved and there was possibly some screw-up, but
[00:18:09.728 --> 00:18:19.811]  You know, he was concerned, and we talked about Blackwater being at his other... that there were civilian-type operators at his other protests.
[00:18:20.831 --> 00:18:22.091]  So I don't want to overstep.
[00:18:22.131 --> 00:18:23.852]  I think probably the video will speak for itself.
[00:18:23.872 --> 00:18:26.953]  I want to be very careful because he was a nice man, and I don't want to put words in his mouth.
[00:18:27.173 --> 00:18:33.734]  However, I definitely felt like he's aware and on board, and it's wonderful to feel that.
[00:18:34.915 --> 00:18:35.455]  Well, I agree.
[00:18:35.475 --> 00:18:35.995]  Continue.
[00:18:36.886 --> 00:18:41.168]  That's pretty much it, with the exception of Mark Ruffalo, who is also a nice guy.
[00:18:41.628 --> 00:18:48.731]  And we got him, you know, to open up and talk about the questionable aspects of the day and the events following.
[00:18:48.931 --> 00:18:55.354]  So, I'm looking forward to seeing that as well, because I don't have a clear enough recollection to really state exactly what they said.
[00:18:55.394 --> 00:19:01.737]  But it's exciting stuff, Alex, and I'm happy to be here, you know, alongside you doing what we're doing, because it's very important for our country.
[00:19:02.555 --> 00:19:07.719]  Absolutely, we're about to go to break and we're going to see if we can grab the audio and play that.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.162]  And we've got your authorization, We Are Change LA, to air that?
[00:19:11.683 --> 00:19:12.163]  Absolutely.
[00:19:12.543 --> 00:19:20.089]  Okay, John, go ahead and go over to We Are Change LA, just LA.org, and see if that is up yet.
[00:19:20.169 --> 00:19:25.434]  As soon as it comes up, we will be playing that audio here on air, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:26.354 --> 00:19:26.875]  I don't know.
[00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:45.051]  And we're going to have that video up on PrisonPlanet.com and TruthNews.us.
[00:19:45.411 --> 00:19:49.976]  Kurt Nemo is in the bombardier seat over at TruthNews.us working on this story.
[00:19:50.296 --> 00:19:57.424]  Paul Watson is piloting Prison Planet as we engage the New World Order with another giant salvo for 9-11 Truth.
[00:20:00.456 --> 00:20:06.663]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:14.911]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:20:15.252 --> 00:20:23.080]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:28.161]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:20:28.482 --> 00:20:33.203]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:20:33.703 --> 00:20:37.564]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:20:38.064 --> 00:20:39.065]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:39.145 --> 00:20:43.226]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:20:43.646 --> 00:20:48.027]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:51.048]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:20:51.528 --> 00:20:53.650]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.932]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:57.152 --> 00:21:02.977]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:21:03.597 --> 00:21:12.524]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:21:12.984 --> 00:21:20.170]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:21:20.882 --> 00:21:26.363]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:21:26.863 --> 00:21:37.685]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:21:38.445 --> 00:21:40.526]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:49.484]  Visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:21:49.564 --> 00:21:50.045]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:21:59.804 --> 00:22:02.185]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:02.266 --> 00:22:12.732]  Did you know that President Kennedy signed into law State Department Publication 7277 entitled, The United States Program for Complete and General Disarmament in a Peaceful World?
[00:22:12.812 --> 00:22:17.995]  This would disarm America and turn all of our armed forces over to the United Nations Organization.
[00:22:18.755 --> 00:22:23.218]  Citizens would be required to turn in their guns guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment.
[00:22:23.898 --> 00:22:29.581]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.
[00:22:30.362 --> 00:22:38.366]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:38.626 --> 00:22:40.027]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800...

[00:22:41.388 --> 00:22:41.648]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:41.688 --> 00:22:42.329]  Call now.
[00:22:42.369 --> 00:22:46.393]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:00.044 --> 00:23:01.886]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:02.046 --> 00:23:07.232]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:23:07.392 --> 00:23:08.753]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:23:09.013 --> 00:23:17.182]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:17.402 --> 00:23:23.128]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:23.428 --> 00:23:23.828]  I don't know.
[00:23:41.314 --> 00:23:41.715]  I think so.
[00:24:02.901 --> 00:24:08.924]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:09.524 --> 00:24:12.506]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:14.266 --> 00:24:23.110]  Alright, I'm back in the gunner's seat.
[00:24:24.831 --> 00:24:26.532]  The audio's gonna be up in 20 minutes, sir.
[00:24:27.902 --> 00:24:28.602]  Almost done.
[00:24:28.862 --> 00:24:32.564]  Grabbing it out of the video and uploading it to an FTP site.
[00:24:33.064 --> 00:24:36.145]  PrisonPlanet.com is standing by to transmit it.
[00:24:36.626 --> 00:24:38.306]  So we'll have it for you by next hour.
[00:24:40.147 --> 00:24:42.148]  Again, going back to our guest.
[00:24:42.188 --> 00:24:44.529]  Sir, I can only commend you for the work you're doing.
[00:24:45.009 --> 00:24:47.010]  I can only commend you for the action you're taking.
[00:24:48.792 --> 00:24:53.394]  Stuart Howell and all of you at We Are Change Los Angeles, We Are Change New York, all of you.
[00:24:54.154 --> 00:25:00.937]  Again, it's catching fire, the aggressiveness of the grassroots not laying down anymore.
[00:25:02.618 --> 00:25:07.900]  The media has now grown to the point, alternative media and the avenues and the venues and the conduits,
[00:25:08.709 --> 00:25:13.292]  To transmit this information, and we are seeing a major resistance to the New World Order right now.
[00:25:13.752 --> 00:25:21.938]  I am extremely excited, and I just salute Martin Sheen and this other well-known actor, Mark Ruffalo, for what they've done.
[00:25:22.838 --> 00:25:23.398]  Me too, Alex.
[00:25:23.479 --> 00:25:26.120]  And I've got to tell you, there was a big shift in how it felt.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.462]  The police seemed to be, you know, very receptive.
[00:25:30.063 --> 00:25:32.164]  They were, you know, happy and helpful with us.
[00:25:32.765 --> 00:25:36.407]  They were very good to Randy when he was taken out and roughed up from the Bill Maher Show.
[00:25:37.106 --> 00:25:43.470]  And it was just nice to see that a lot of people are on board, and more of them are coming on board as they begin to wake up.
[00:25:45.632 --> 00:25:54.578]  Absolutely, and Paul Watson just told me he's about to post the next ten minutes on PrisonPlanet.com, the first big article about this, with those incredible quotes from Martin Sheen.
[00:25:54.618 --> 00:25:56.259]  More of them coming here later today.
[00:25:56.299 --> 00:26:04.905]  Everybody call if you're listening on an AM or FM station in Kansas City, or 1330 North of Austin, or WBCR, or Upstate New York, or Southern California.
[00:26:05.645 --> 00:26:13.029]  Or Montana, Wyoming, Utah where we have stations, Illinois, Ohio, all of our great affiliates.
[00:26:13.109 --> 00:26:16.610]  If you're listening on AM or FM, call your friends, call your neighbors, tell them to tune in.
[00:26:16.651 --> 00:26:17.451]  This is big news.
[00:26:17.471 --> 00:26:22.914]  If you're listening at PrisonPlanet.com, tell everybody to tune in right now because you're going to hear all this broken here on air.
[00:26:22.934 --> 00:26:26.835]  And I want to thank you, Stuart, and We Are Change LA for coming to us with this.
[00:26:26.915 --> 00:26:27.756]  I really appreciate it.
[00:26:27.776 --> 00:26:29.817]  I'm sorry I didn't get in touch with you yesterday.
[00:26:30.397 --> 00:26:30.997]  Not a problem.
[00:26:31.038 --> 00:26:43.764]  I'd just like to thank everybody in our group and Luke and everybody out there who's doing what we're doing because we're doing this because we saw it being done somewhere else and it's catching on and we just want to see accountability and truth brought back into the government of our country.
[00:26:43.925 --> 00:26:48.207]  Well it also brings safety to 9-11 activists and we are change activists and activists period.
[00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:53.750]  Because the more of us do this, the Glenn Becks who are scared, and they admit they're scared that it's spreading.
[00:26:54.710 --> 00:27:01.113]  Of course, Tucker Carlson says it's spreading, and a large portion of Americans, now a majority by the way, believe it's an inside job.
[00:27:01.474 --> 00:27:09.998]  They can't sit there and call us terrorists or kooks or say we're dangerous and try to equate us with that anymore, because we are the majority and we have the science!
[00:27:10.178 --> 00:27:10.638]  Comments?
[00:27:11.079 --> 00:27:17.362]  You know, Alex, absolutely, and I want to speak to that about this new HR 1955 thing and how they're trying to color us as
[00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:21.323]  Even potentially violent, and we are exactly the opposite of that.
[00:27:21.343 --> 00:27:39.751]  You know, we are using words and open-minded thinking, and we're trying to get information out peacefully, about creating peaceful and honest change, and actually not really a revolution to something, but back to what we were founded as, which was a constitutional Republican rule of law, and we want peace and openness and
[00:27:40.151 --> 00:27:41.892]  You know, we don't advocate anything violent.
[00:27:41.952 --> 00:27:43.693]  And this new thing is pre-crime.
[00:27:43.734 --> 00:27:47.636]  It says you don't have to talk violently, and it passed the House, about to pass the Senate.
[00:27:48.036 --> 00:27:53.940]  It's just if they decide that maybe someone could extrapolate it later, and they do something violent, you're a terrorist.
[00:27:54.181 --> 00:27:56.042]  I mean, folks, that is a terrorist government.
[00:27:56.242 --> 00:28:00.325]  That's a Soviet-slash-Nazi government that would do something like that.
[00:28:00.385 --> 00:28:02.046]  It just shows you who they are!
[00:28:02.546 --> 00:28:09.714]  Yeah, it's very killing, and we're all about peace and honesty, and if that has them scared, that's a frightening thing in itself.
[00:28:09.734 --> 00:28:16.821]  Well, they can't infiltrate the thousands of groups that have formed, the hundreds of activists every week that are out confronting politicians, the millions that are awake.
[00:28:17.042 --> 00:28:17.963]  They can't do it!
[00:28:18.063 --> 00:28:18.723]  Game over!
[00:28:18.743 --> 00:28:19.284]  Yeah.
[00:28:19.825 --> 00:28:20.065]  Amen.
[00:28:21.198 --> 00:28:22.259]  Folks, it is up to you.
[00:28:22.279 --> 00:28:24.201]  I mean, what about the George Carlin thing?
[00:28:24.221 --> 00:28:25.403]  We're gonna play that when we get back.
[00:28:25.663 --> 00:28:27.505]  Well, you know, he's always been great.
[00:28:27.585 --> 00:28:33.972]  The clip of him in the Zeitgeist movie is phenomenal, where he talks about, you know, the real power behind the puppets.
[00:28:35.763 --> 00:28:40.307]  Or when he talks about why Americans have been dumbed down from the smartest to the dumbest by design.
[00:28:40.547 --> 00:28:41.168]  Absolutely.
[00:28:41.308 --> 00:28:50.075]  You know, and the comical take on it and the irony of it is just such a great way to wake people up to it, because we don't want to be belligerent in your face.
[00:28:50.356 --> 00:28:57.362]  We consciously took on the tone of the video from the Brussels march, the 9-11 march, where it was mainstream people, you know,
[00:28:57.862 --> 00:29:05.106]  This is an incredible crime for the military-industrial complex to carry out this attack, to push their whole police state agenda, their war agenda, their energy agenda.
[00:29:05.146 --> 00:29:05.926]  The word is out!
[00:29:05.946 --> 00:29:08.967]  And what do you expect us to do when you kill our people?
[00:29:22.914 --> 00:29:24.835]  And we know you can kill more of us at any time.
[00:29:24.895 --> 00:29:25.875]  We know you're terrorists.
[00:29:26.195 --> 00:29:27.495]  We have to fight you.
[00:29:27.736 --> 00:29:28.856]  You didn't give us a choice.
[00:29:28.896 --> 00:29:32.917]  That's why I made the film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, now out.
[00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:39.479]  You can watch it right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv or Infowars.com.
[00:29:39.499 --> 00:29:41.760]  You can order the DVDs that are shipping out today.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.480]  Order Endgame today.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:48.762]  We'll talk to We Are Change, Los Angeles, on the front lines of the Infowars.
[00:29:50.454 --> 00:29:53.441]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.384 --> 00:29:57.071]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.626 --> 00:30:04.910]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:10.055]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:11.576]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:11.756 --> 00:30:15.139]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with CalBin Pure Soaps?
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:20.544]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.311]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[00:30:35.552 --> 00:30:36.493]  No animal testing.
[00:30:36.733 --> 00:30:38.053]  I use them and love them.
[00:30:38.073 --> 00:30:39.674]  Knowing they're all naturally safe.
[00:30:39.954 --> 00:30:41.074]  And I save big time.
[00:30:41.374 --> 00:30:42.594]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:30:42.614 --> 00:30:42.854]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[00:30:52.857 --> 00:30:59.360]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[00:31:01.402 --> 00:31:02.642]  This is Elizabeth Border.
[00:31:03.202 --> 00:31:03.843]  News alert!
[00:31:04.363 --> 00:31:08.585]  Twice a month, you can now get the Divided Kingdom's brand new newsletter.
[00:31:09.025 --> 00:31:09.586]  Concise?
[00:31:09.886 --> 00:31:10.506]  Hard-hitting?
[00:31:10.866 --> 00:31:13.788]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[00:31:14.148 --> 00:31:15.329]  War in Iran?
[00:31:15.349 --> 00:31:17.510]  A coming One World Church?
[00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:23.574]  And the first issue has included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.
[00:31:24.094 --> 00:31:31.538]  For a free sample copy of the Divided Kingdom dossier, write to Post Office Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland, 21609.
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:40.104]  A yearly subscription is only $50 for a newsletter that comes not once, but twice every month.
[00:31:40.644 --> 00:31:46.186]  Get the spiritual support you need right now for your free sample copy to P.O.
[00:31:46.246 --> 00:31:48.707]  Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland, 21609.
[00:31:50.048 --> 00:31:55.610]  Once again, for your free copy of the Divided Kingdom Dossier newsletter, write to P.O.
[00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.330]  Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland, 21609.
[00:32:00.279 --> 00:32:04.362]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[00:32:04.623 --> 00:32:09.687]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[00:32:10.007 --> 00:32:14.630]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[00:32:14.991 --> 00:32:16.952]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[00:32:17.252 --> 00:32:23.097]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[00:32:23.477 --> 00:32:24.178]  And it works!
[00:32:24.682 --> 00:32:26.122]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[00:32:26.523 --> 00:32:27.523]  Now it's your turn.
[00:32:27.783 --> 00:32:30.144]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[00:32:30.304 --> 00:32:34.565]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[00:32:34.885 --> 00:32:37.966]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[00:32:38.346 --> 00:32:40.547]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[00:32:40.747 --> 00:32:43.088]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[00:32:43.128 --> 00:32:43.348]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[00:32:43.368 --> 00:32:46.049]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[00:32:46.069 --> 00:32:46.289]  Guaranteed.
[00:32:53.491 --> 00:32:53.731]  Call 1-800-894-5152.
[00:32:53.751 --> 00:32:54.051]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[00:32:54.071 --> 00:32:54.712]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:32:54.732 --> 00:32:56.192]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:43.142]  One of the great guys from We Are Change LA, Adam, who shot the footage, is uploading it right now.
[00:33:43.262 --> 00:33:45.442]  I'm going to try to get him on next hour after we play it.
[00:33:46.303 --> 00:33:49.184]  Anybody else from WeAreChange.org in New York?
[00:33:49.244 --> 00:33:51.084]  Anybody else wants to get on later in the show?
[00:33:51.484 --> 00:33:56.686]  This is a celebration of getting the info out, and Martin Sheen is just absolutely amazing.
[00:33:57.953 --> 00:34:00.834]  I interviewed his son, Charlie Sheen, and I'm good friends with him.
[00:34:01.235 --> 00:34:03.636]  He's such a gentlemanly, friendly person, so intelligent.
[00:34:03.996 --> 00:34:10.899]  All the things you hear about him in the news are total lies or distortions, and they're going to have a lot of trouble trying to demonize Martin Sheen.
[00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:12.160]  Just incredible courage.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.120]  He knew he was doing an interview.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.481]  He knew he was doing it with We Are Change.
[00:34:18.562 --> 00:34:20.923]  Just did an absolutely incredible thing.
[00:34:21.223 --> 00:34:23.704]  Again, Paul Watson is writing the breaking story on this.
[00:34:24.104 --> 00:34:26.824]  It should be up very soon on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:27.285 --> 00:34:29.945]  You heard that exclusive quote from the audio coming up.
[00:34:30.345 --> 00:34:32.146]  Thanks to We Are Change Los Angeles.
[00:34:32.626 --> 00:34:36.227]  Now here is the George Carlin.
[00:34:36.387 --> 00:34:38.688]  This is also up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:40.131 --> 00:34:45.495]  See, when other people are playing around and screwing around on the weekend, we are changing LA as out there doing interviews.
[00:34:45.835 --> 00:34:48.297]  We are changing New York as out there confronting people and doing interviews.
[00:34:48.717 --> 00:34:55.682]  And we're busy on the weekend, too, noticing that they did an interview with George Carlin and then writing an article on it.
[00:34:55.862 --> 00:34:58.644]  That's the reason that PrisonPlanet.com is so big.
[00:34:58.664 --> 00:34:59.145]  I could care less.
[00:34:59.185 --> 00:35:01.286]  I wish there were a hundred other sites bigger than PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:01.326 --> 00:35:04.008]  It's scary to be on the very front line, be the tip of the spear.
[00:35:04.749 --> 00:35:06.330]  Go get the George Carlin questions.
[00:35:08.487 --> 00:35:12.569]  The official 9-11 story up on PrisonPlanet.com and beat the Dig Brigade.
[00:35:12.609 --> 00:35:14.670]  Everybody go ahead and dig that up and get on the front page of Dig.
[00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:15.871]  Get it out to everybody else.
[00:35:15.911 --> 00:35:16.671]  That is huge.
[00:35:17.011 --> 00:35:20.993]  We're about to go back to Stuart Howell who interviewed Martin Sheen here in just a moment.
[00:35:22.894 --> 00:35:27.697]  But here is George Carlin being talked to by We Are Change New York.
[00:35:27.717 --> 00:35:28.017]  Here it is.
[00:35:28.957 --> 00:35:29.778]  Hi George, how are you doing?
[00:35:29.838 --> 00:35:30.298]  I'm J.R.
[00:35:30.618 --> 00:35:31.379]  J.R.!
[00:35:31.479 --> 00:35:31.859]  Yeah.
[00:35:32.199 --> 00:35:33.160]  I was initial.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.081]  Either of these to you or what?
[00:35:36.121 --> 00:35:36.562]  Yeah, sure.
[00:35:36.602 --> 00:35:36.722]  J.R.
[00:35:39.812 --> 00:35:48.099]  I wanted to ask you, George, I'm really curious to find out what you think about this whole 9-11 conspiracy truce movement thing that's going on across the nation.
[00:35:48.139 --> 00:35:50.341]  They interrupted Bill Maher's show last Friday.
[00:35:50.882 --> 00:35:52.503]  What are your personal thoughts on that?
[00:35:53.384 --> 00:35:54.364]  Would you care to comment on that?
[00:35:54.444 --> 00:35:56.706]  I always question the received reality.
[00:35:57.107 --> 00:36:01.750]  The consensus reality is often intentionally misleading.
[00:36:02.071 --> 00:36:03.752]  Would you support a new investigation on 9-11?
[00:36:07.655 --> 00:36:09.397]  They don't investigate themselves.
[00:36:09.537 --> 00:36:11.979]  Those people, there would be a lot of them.
[00:36:11.999 --> 00:36:13.540]  It would be like the Kennedy thing.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.501]  It would be like everything.
[00:36:15.141 --> 00:36:19.604]  The people who are in charge do what they want, and they will always do what they want.
[00:36:19.665 --> 00:36:21.986]  The power does what it wants to.
[00:36:22.367 --> 00:36:24.408]  And I wouldn't trust an investigation.
[00:36:24.448 --> 00:36:25.009]  This is fun.
[00:36:25.029 --> 00:36:26.109]  It's good speculation.
[00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:27.410]  Because you are.
[00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:28.411]  You're getting this on here.
[00:36:28.611 --> 00:36:29.832]  Oh, yeah.
[00:36:30.093 --> 00:36:31.353]  Well, anyway, now you know.
[00:36:31.894 --> 00:36:32.755]  Take care of yourself.
[00:36:32.775 --> 00:36:33.315]  Thank you so much.
[00:36:33.335 --> 00:36:33.795]  Appreciate it.
[00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:36.871]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:36:36.911 --> 00:36:46.394]  There he is, not only saying he questions the official reality when asked about 9-11 truth, but then he goes on to say that it'd be a total whitewash by the people.
[00:36:47.334 --> 00:36:47.674]  You see?
[00:36:47.694 --> 00:36:55.477]  I mean, that is huge, but this Martin Sheen, just the one quote you've now heard, and the full interview coming up, this is so amazing.
[00:36:56.286 --> 00:36:57.247]  And you know why it's amazing?
[00:36:57.667 --> 00:37:00.408]  Because the criminals that murdered those people need to be brought to justice.
[00:37:00.448 --> 00:37:07.392]  And if we don't bring them to justice, they're going to keep murdering us, keep staging terror attacks, keep using this agenda of problem, reaction, solution.
[00:37:08.013 --> 00:37:11.195]  Of false flag, black off, inside job, terror.
[00:37:11.855 --> 00:37:12.896]  We don't have a choice.
[00:37:12.956 --> 00:37:14.356]  We have to expose this.
[00:37:14.396 --> 00:37:15.797]  Don't you know I get scared sometimes?
[00:37:16.318 --> 00:37:18.079]  Don't you know I have to gut up and commit?
[00:37:18.759 --> 00:37:21.220]  Don't you know I had to count the cost before I ever even did this?
[00:37:21.641 --> 00:37:23.842]  But together, all of us, they can't get all of us.
[00:37:25.163 --> 00:37:26.784]  I'm kind of like the guy that stepped up first.
[00:37:27.965 --> 00:37:29.987]  And there's been so many before us that they took down.
[00:37:30.067 --> 00:37:31.088]  And it's scary, folks.
[00:37:31.788 --> 00:37:35.011]  But it's scarier to let them keep running roughshod and to keep ruling over us.
[00:37:35.051 --> 00:37:37.033]  So again, this is literally life and death.
[00:37:37.053 --> 00:37:37.993]  This is info war.
[00:37:38.233 --> 00:37:40.375]  This is about the survival of this nation and the planet.
[00:37:40.595 --> 00:37:42.037]  This is literally for all the marbles.
[00:37:42.337 --> 00:37:43.678]  This is the main crisis.
[00:37:43.698 --> 00:37:46.360]  That's why I made Endgame Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:37:47.901 --> 00:37:52.585]  Going back to the absolutely amazing folks at We Are Change LA, Stuart
[00:37:57.066 --> 00:37:57.887]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:37:57.907 --> 00:37:58.308]  Thank you.
[00:37:58.568 --> 00:38:05.196]  I'd just like to say what got me into actually getting out and doing things and showing up at actions was seeing other people doing it.
[00:38:05.336 --> 00:38:10.161]  And I was a bit scared and reluctant, but I felt so strongly that if I didn't stand up,
[00:38:11.201 --> 00:38:11.722]  Who would?
[00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:27.236]  And now that I can see that there are other people standing up and coming from a good, loving, kind, concerned about their fellow man place, I got out there and started doing little things and then things got bigger and then I joined with people and the actions got a bit stronger.
[00:38:27.256 --> 00:38:33.282]  But I'd just like to say to anybody who's kind of waiting in the wings and feeling the need to stand shoulder to shoulder with people that are
[00:38:33.752 --> 00:38:36.553]  You know, trying to affect change like Luke and like you.
[00:38:37.274 --> 00:38:47.538]  Once you actually get out there, like Bruno pointed out and Katie about at the Mar Show, this incredible peace and power and centered love fills you and empowers you.
[00:38:47.898 --> 00:38:53.961]  So, you know, you can stand in front of a celebrity and ask them questions even though you may not be comfortable, you know, in front of people.
[00:38:54.021 --> 00:38:56.902]  Or you can do whatever the situation calls for because
[00:38:57.342 --> 00:39:11.808]  Something you can feel is empowering you to do the right thing, and it's a wonderfully empowering and great thing to feel, and I urge everybody to take whatever steps might be a little uncomfortable, to get out there and join us, and let's take our country back!
[00:39:13.633 --> 00:39:27.203]  There is no doubt from the quotes and the audios coming up that Martin Sheen has gone public for 9-11 Truth and in support of his son Charlie in a big way knowing it was an interview knowing what it was for he did it and we just commend him we need to pray for him and support their family.
[00:39:28.124 --> 00:39:41.714]  I got to try to get a hold of Charlie during the break and get his take on all this I tried to call him earlier this morning but again it's it's um it's out there on the west coast uh so much happening right now you know I liken this to the old naval
[00:39:42.952 --> 00:39:55.797]  Uh, fights that I read about where you'd have a merchant ship out there with more people on board and more fighters than a pirate ship, but the pirates would come up with their big skull and crossbones flag, and that meant, submit to us or you'll all die.
[00:39:56.057 --> 00:39:58.538]  And a lot of times people, just out of intimidation, would give up.
[00:39:58.918 --> 00:40:09.102]  But a lot of times the pirates would ram them, come up, jump them on board, throw their hooks on them, jump over, and if the people just rallied and fought back, they would run the pirates off and defeat them and take their ship.
[00:40:09.763 --> 00:40:10.423]  And the New World Order
[00:40:11.713 --> 00:40:12.053]  I think so.
[00:40:31.548 --> 00:40:34.069]  Imagine going public before 9-11 like I had to do.
[00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:39.633]  Imagine going public the day it happened and having like half my stations kick me off and turn off, you know, and say, we're not carrying your show anymore.
[00:40:39.653 --> 00:40:42.254]  Well, first they called and said, you're off if you keep talking like that.
[00:40:42.274 --> 00:40:44.976]  Because I'd been the good guy bashing Bill Clinton before that.
[00:40:44.996 --> 00:40:46.016]  Well, that was because he was corrupt.
[00:40:48.695 --> 00:40:50.196]  And I said, no, I'm not going to shut up.
[00:40:50.276 --> 00:40:53.679]  And you know, this show is 50 times bigger, literally, than it was then.
[00:40:53.699 --> 00:40:55.080]  And I didn't submit.
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:55.961]  I didn't cower.
[00:40:56.001 --> 00:40:58.443]  I didn't go in for the fear.
[00:40:58.483 --> 00:41:00.264]  I didn't go in for monetary punishment.
[00:41:00.845 --> 00:41:02.306]  That's just the way it goes.
[00:41:02.386 --> 00:41:03.327]  I had to tell the truth.
[00:41:03.387 --> 00:41:04.488]  I knew it was a black op.
[00:41:05.208 --> 00:41:07.610]  And now, people, I mean, what excuse do you have?
[00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:08.851]  You know it's an inside job.
[00:41:09.092 --> 00:41:11.894]  You've got to speak up or the killers win!
[00:41:13.595 --> 00:41:14.336]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:41:14.416 --> 00:41:18.199]  And you know, we had a highway patrolman at one of our events out here on Venice Boardwalk.
[00:41:18.875 --> 00:41:21.537]  And the police were very, very good with us.
[00:41:21.597 --> 00:41:23.418]  They took some literature, read the literature.
[00:41:23.438 --> 00:41:24.799]  I approached a couple of them.
[00:41:24.819 --> 00:41:29.662]  I didn't get it on camera, but I know I asked one of them, you know, what they felt about how everything was going.
[00:41:29.722 --> 00:41:33.344]  And everybody seemed to be a good crowd and things were, you know, under control.
[00:41:33.384 --> 00:41:36.986]  And they said, yeah, everybody's on the same page today, is what these officers told me.
[00:41:37.286 --> 00:41:40.488]  And they said, I wish it could be like this all the time and every day.
[00:41:40.928 --> 00:41:51.570]  So now that we're rallying to stop the war and stop the New World Order from proceeding down their path, I think we're going to see a lot more people, and we are seeing a lot more people, join together in solidarity.
[00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:54.831]  And the more that come out, the more come out.
[00:41:55.071 --> 00:41:56.291]  And it's exciting to see that.
[00:41:56.311 --> 00:41:56.851]  I agree.
[00:41:56.911 --> 00:42:00.392]  When police defend the First Amendment and defend liberty, I love them and I defend them.
[00:42:00.412 --> 00:42:01.972]  And when they do a good job, I defend them.
[00:42:02.272 --> 00:42:03.953]  And 80% of them are good.
[00:42:04.333 --> 00:42:07.553]  The bad thing is, is that the system is trying to promote the bad cops.
[00:42:08.094 --> 00:42:09.554]  And I've made mistakes in the past getting
[00:42:10.442 --> 00:42:14.084]  Threatened by police at a primitive level and, you know, howling and screaming.
[00:42:14.104 --> 00:42:18.106]  But really, I've said the last six months or so, I've been realizing that it's about reaching out to them.
[00:42:18.146 --> 00:42:19.226]  They're citizens, too.
[00:42:19.446 --> 00:42:19.666]  Yes.
[00:42:20.567 --> 00:42:22.588]  Their children are under this attack, too.
[00:42:22.928 --> 00:42:23.408]  Absolutely.
[00:42:23.428 --> 00:42:24.448]  And they're starting to see that.
[00:42:24.468 --> 00:42:25.809]  And they're actually really great out here.
[00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:29.991]  And I commend all the good officers that we have out here that are, you know, that are feeling it.
[00:42:31.906 --> 00:42:32.967]  Well, I don't know what to say.
[00:42:33.148 --> 00:42:49.446]  I am with bated breath knowing that that audio is being uploaded now to an FTP site and we're going to have it up on PrisonPlanet.com and Truth in News and InfoWars and Jones Report and all of them just as soon as possible.
[00:42:49.486 --> 00:42:51.749]  This was going to be big news today on the show with George Carlin.
[00:42:52.435 --> 00:42:54.596]  And now it's dwarfed by Martin Sheen.
[00:42:54.916 --> 00:43:00.919]  Read those quotes again before I got you on air and you had to stop getting the transcript from the audio over the phone before they uploaded it.
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:03.941]  And then again, that audio is coming up by at least the next hour.
[00:43:04.801 --> 00:43:08.123]  I mean, recap that story and read some of those quotes again.
[00:43:09.063 --> 00:43:19.849]  Well, I went up and asked him what his thoughts were on 9-11 and what we could do to help, what his take was on the situation and what we could as a people do to help the situation.
[00:43:20.687 --> 00:43:22.749]  He said, I don't know what to suggest.
[00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:30.836]  He said that his son Charlie had brought a lot of information to him, you know, over the last couple of years.
[00:43:30.936 --> 00:43:32.077]  I guess a lot of it through you.
[00:43:32.097 --> 00:43:34.039]  And that there were a lot of questions.
[00:43:34.519 --> 00:43:45.749]  But then about a year ago, he said, then, about a year and a half ago, I believe it was, he said, I was dubious, was the exact quote, but I did not want to believe that my government could be involved in such a thing.
[00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:48.111]  None of us, and I said, yeah, none of us want to believe that.
[00:43:48.747 --> 00:43:51.388]  He said, I could not live in a country that I thought could do that.
[00:43:51.768 --> 00:43:53.769]  That would be ultimate betrayal.
[00:43:54.370 --> 00:44:02.333]  And he went on to say, then, however, there have been so many revelations that now I have my doubts, and chief among them is Building 7.
[00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:06.995]  How did they rig that building so that it came down on the evening of the day?
[00:44:07.855 --> 00:44:14.078]  And, you know, I said, are you referring to Larry Silverstein and the whole, you know, how they made a decision to pull it?
[00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:15.199]  He said, yeah, pull it.
[00:44:15.279 --> 00:44:16.059]  How convenient.
[00:44:16.879 --> 00:44:18.120]  When did they rig that building?
[00:44:18.922 --> 00:44:24.086]  Absolutely, and again, I literally have my heart pattering to get more of the quotes and to be able to play this on air.
[00:44:45.274 --> 00:44:47.235]  Again, so incredibly excited.
[00:44:47.255 --> 00:44:54.176]  I guess you were unable to listen to the audio and get transcripts before we air it, what Ruffalo said, but just from memory, what are some of the things that Ruffalo said?
[00:44:56.777 --> 00:45:00.178]  You know, I really would hate to say, I would hate to say, I just want to be cautious.
[00:45:01.138 --> 00:45:02.239]  It was along the same lines.
[00:45:02.279 --> 00:45:10.781]  He questions, you know, several aspects of the day, several, you know, aspects of since that day and of surrounding that day.
[00:45:11.457 --> 00:45:16.879]  And I think I'm just going to, you know, just let the video and the audio speak for itself because I don't want to misspeak.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:20.941]  It was so nice to let me talk to him and for him to be honest and open.
[00:45:20.961 --> 00:45:22.242]  I don't want to say the wrong thing here.
[00:45:22.262 --> 00:45:24.043]  Well, Mark Ruffalo is a huge star.
[00:45:24.083 --> 00:45:31.446]  I mean, all over TV, hundreds of movies, you name it, from The Last Castle to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
[00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:52.351]  The rumor has it, Reservation Road, Zodiac, All the King's Men, Just Like Heaven, Collateral 13 going on 30, Eternal Sunshine, I'm reading down now, We Don't Live Here Anymore, In The Cut, View From The Top, My Life Without Me, Windtalkers, The Last Castle, Life Drawing, The Beat, Get On It,
[00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:54.771]  Someone on the watch over me.
[00:45:56.052 --> 00:45:57.393]  Just on and on and on.
[00:45:57.433 --> 00:45:58.574]  I'm a big fan of this guy.
[00:45:58.834 --> 00:45:59.635]  Yeah, he's a great guy.
[00:45:59.655 --> 00:46:04.599]  He's a nice guy and I've loved his work for a while, so it was very exciting to be able to chat with him and get this on film.
[00:46:05.619 --> 00:46:15.246]  And again, the IMDB goes on for page after page of all the Screen Actors Guilds and all the things he's done and all the times he's been on Daily Show, Ellen DeGeneres,
[00:46:16.505 --> 00:46:18.128]  Just on and on and on.
[00:46:29.787 --> 00:46:34.730]  Mark Ruffalo, Martin Sheen, following in the footsteps of Charlie Sheen.
[00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:36.571]  Absolutely incredible day.
[00:46:37.192 --> 00:46:39.233]  And that audio, again, is coming up.
[00:46:39.273 --> 00:46:45.517]  In fact, I'm going to give you the floor to talk about LA We Are Change and then to recruit folks for your powerful chapter taking action.
[00:46:45.697 --> 00:46:48.999]  And I'm going to run out of the room and find out if they've uploaded that yet to that FTP.
[00:46:49.019 --> 00:46:49.659]  You've got the floor.
[00:46:49.699 --> 00:46:50.400]  You've got the helm.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.020]  Take over.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.001]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:46:52.461 --> 00:46:54.403]  Yeah, we're a small group that's growing.
[00:46:54.883 --> 00:47:01.249]  We have a little core membership of nine, and then we have a lot of people on our meetup boards who are inviting to come to actions.
[00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:04.792]  We have a big action in Santa Monica on 11-11.
[00:47:05.153 --> 00:47:10.838]  I believe it's Veterans Day, and that's going to be at the Bluff on top of the Santa Monica Pier in Santa Monica.
[00:47:11.297 --> 00:47:16.398]  The cross street is Ocean Avenue in Colorado, and we're inviting everybody to come down.
[00:47:16.478 --> 00:47:20.239]  It's going to be a peaceful outreach and a march.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:28.982]  Depending on how many people we have, we'll have maybe some tables set up, and some street actions, and some marches, and just kind of an outreach to get people on board.
[00:47:29.022 --> 00:47:32.163]  We're going to be giving out free flyers, DVDs, and whatnot.
[00:47:32.863 --> 00:47:33.903]  We have a great group.
[00:47:34.423 --> 00:47:37.684]  We have nine of us, and we're kind of reaching out.
[00:47:38.508 --> 00:47:48.274]  You know, outside of the little CORE Steering Committee group to, you know, to have events and I guess we have several hundred people now in our meetups and, you know, we encourage everybody to join with us.
[00:47:48.994 --> 00:47:54.017]  WeAreChangeLA.org and to show up at our events, any other events.
[00:47:54.097 --> 00:48:00.901]  You know, we're trying to work with all other groups and, you know, kind of grow the truth and kind of get our country headed back on track.
[00:48:02.082 --> 00:48:06.885]  We don't really feel good about the direction it's headed and, you know, I've got to take a minute just to applaud you, Alex.
[00:48:07.879 --> 00:48:08.740]  For the work you've done.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:15.783]  To see and hear you in Endgame, bullhorning the Bilderberg Group, was just phenomenal.
[00:48:15.883 --> 00:48:23.767]  Those words, for me, were right up there with any of the great presidential speeches, or JFK, or MLK.
[00:48:24.288 --> 00:48:25.668]  It was just phenomenal to see that.
[00:48:25.708 --> 00:48:34.293]  And that empowers us to try to speak truth to power, whether it's government or whatnot.
[00:48:34.333 --> 00:48:36.534]  Just being honest and truthful is a very powerful thing.
[00:48:38.373 --> 00:48:41.238]  I'm thrilled and humbled to be part of this whole movement.
[00:48:41.378 --> 00:48:46.046]  It's great people and it's great ideas.
[00:48:46.086 --> 00:48:51.376]  We're really trying to put into action, into the streets, the things that our Founding Fathers
[00:48:53.062 --> 00:49:01.505]  And how dare Glenn Beck and all them say it's un-American to speak out and expose this when government-sponsored terror has been declassified over 200 times.
[00:49:02.025 --> 00:49:17.169]  I mean, you know, the analogy is some 55-year-old bank robber who's been in prison for 20 years for bank robbery when they were 30 years old gets out, he's got gray hair and a tattoo of an anchor on his left forearm
[00:49:17.961 --> 00:49:36.027]  And somebody walks in a bank who's 55, bald-headed with an anchor on his left forearm, and he robs the bank, and the first thing the FBI and the police do is they go look at mug shots, they go checkin' the computers, they see who just got out, and then they go to their house and they go after him, and nine times out of ten, it's them!
[00:49:36.667 --> 00:49:37.027]  Okay!
[00:49:37.805 --> 00:49:42.628]  We have a government that has declassified that it staged terror over and over and over again.
[00:49:42.668 --> 00:49:43.508]  It's not our government.
[00:49:43.748 --> 00:49:47.230]  It's a criminal group that took over our government, clearly with the National Security Act of 1947.
[00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:47.830]  They're in control.
[00:49:51.508 --> 00:49:53.210]  They've carried out all these terror attacks.
[00:49:53.370 --> 00:50:03.521]  The PNAC, the Vice President, when he was former Defense Secretary in 2000, writes a document saying we need big, helpful Pearl Harbor catalyzing events to launch our new world order.
[00:50:03.962 --> 00:50:04.943]  Big terror attacks.
[00:50:04.983 --> 00:50:06.485]  All these other top experts write it.
[00:50:06.865 --> 00:50:10.329]  The CFR says, minus a big catalyzing event, we're not going to get it.
[00:50:11.247 --> 00:50:15.049]  Uh, in the big threat assessment they put out, uh, in 2000.
[00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:24.654]  And then magically it happens and it gets their whole agenda and gets Bush's approval rating up from 40% to the all-time high of 95% of any president ever.
[00:50:24.694 --> 00:50:25.714]  Everyone rallying around.
[00:50:25.974 --> 00:50:28.196]  They launch and attack the two wrong countries.
[00:50:28.536 --> 00:50:32.498]  They, even if you believe it, it came out of Saudi Arabia, 15 of the 19 hijackers.
[00:50:32.918 --> 00:50:34.839]  I mean, what do you expect us to do?
[00:50:35.723 --> 00:50:38.044]  What do you expect us to do when they have the motive?
[00:50:38.264 --> 00:50:39.624]  They wrote about how they wanted it.
[00:50:39.784 --> 00:50:41.285]  They've been caught doing it in the past.
[00:50:41.785 --> 00:50:43.466]  I'm going after the chief suspect.
[00:50:43.966 --> 00:50:45.166]  And what do you think happened?
[00:50:45.386 --> 00:50:47.567]  Lo and behold, the chief suspect was guilty!
[00:50:47.887 --> 00:50:48.327]  Guilty!
[00:50:48.627 --> 00:50:49.068]  Guilty!
[00:50:49.348 --> 00:50:49.888]  Guilty!
[00:50:50.488 --> 00:50:52.029]  The Info War continues.
[00:50:52.189 --> 00:50:53.309]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:53.409 --> 00:50:55.230]  This is Historical Talk Radio.
[00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:56.090]  Stay with us.
[00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:57.611]  The transmission continues.
[00:51:00.992 --> 00:51:02.412]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.473 --> 00:51:04.473]  A new world order.
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:09.424]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:51:10.125 --> 00:51:11.866]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[00:51:12.947 --> 00:51:15.190]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:18.192]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:18.913 --> 00:51:26.240]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:29.255 --> 00:51:34.238]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:34.719 --> 00:51:38.181]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:38.561 --> 00:51:41.063]  Bill Burgess is making great progress for the world government.
[00:51:41.143 --> 00:51:42.284]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:42.304 --> 00:51:43.024]  They're not after money.
[00:51:43.044 --> 00:51:44.165]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:44.365 --> 00:51:45.126]  They're after power.
[00:51:45.346 --> 00:51:46.126]  That's what they're after.

[00:51:58.034 --> 00:51:59.055]  You have been warned.
[00:52:00.356 --> 00:52:03.920]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:04.480]  are located?
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:08.084]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:52:08.304 --> 00:52:13.009]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:52:13.289 --> 00:52:20.236]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas, brewing environmental catastrophes,
[00:52:20.476 --> 00:52:21.097]  We're good to go.
[00:52:37.188 --> 00:52:37.708]  I think so.
[00:52:59.921 --> 00:53:02.663]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[00:53:03.003 --> 00:53:09.486]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription filled.

[00:53:53.275 --> 00:53:54.296]  Do it today!
[00:53:54.316 --> 00:53:55.576]  Before you slip into unconsciousness
[00:54:09.824 --> 00:54:30.556]  Alright, I just talked to Adam.
[00:54:31.676 --> 00:54:34.838]  Again, he's having trouble converting the video to audio.
[00:54:34.878 --> 00:54:36.299]  He's going to a friend's house to do it.
[00:54:37.208 --> 00:54:40.891]  Technical stuff and messing with it is a hassle if you don't do it professionally.
[00:54:41.812 --> 00:54:42.872]  And we still have problems here.
[00:54:42.892 --> 00:54:49.798]  So what he's going to do is, in the next segment, he's just going to put the phone up to the speaker, hooked up to the video camera, and play the audio.
[00:54:49.838 --> 00:54:56.163]  Then he's going to go get it transferred in the next 30 minutes or so, and then you'll be able to hear it in the middle of the second or third hour clearly.
[00:54:56.223 --> 00:55:00.646]  But this works pretty good with phones up to televisions, if it's done right.
[00:55:00.706 --> 00:55:02.047]  He's going to gauge that with John from Network.
[00:55:02.067 --> 00:55:05.590]  We're going to get the best audio to get that over to you.
[00:55:07.117 --> 00:55:14.800]  Again, Mark Ruffalo, huge actor, Martin Sheen, gigantic icon actor in all these Academy Award winning films, top TV shows.
[00:55:18.461 --> 00:55:21.922]  I left my cell phone on and all my crazed behavior.
[00:55:25.823 --> 00:55:26.503]  Hold on one second.
[00:55:27.163 --> 00:55:27.444]  Hello?
[00:55:29.224 --> 00:55:30.324]  Hey man, listen, I'm on air.
[00:55:30.344 --> 00:55:31.865]  Can I call you right back in two minutes?
[00:55:32.794 --> 00:55:33.154]  No, no, no.
[00:55:33.174 --> 00:55:35.235]  I mean, I put everything on hold.
[00:55:35.695 --> 00:55:36.875]  I'll call you back in two minutes, okay?
[00:55:39.616 --> 00:55:40.096]  I understand.
[00:55:40.396 --> 00:55:40.816]  You know what?
[00:55:41.137 --> 00:55:42.057]  Hold on one second, okay?
[00:55:42.877 --> 00:55:43.857]  Just run some music for a minute.
[00:55:44.978 --> 00:55:45.398]  Okay, bro.
[00:55:45.558 --> 00:55:45.798]  I'm here.
[00:55:45.818 --> 00:55:46.118]  What's up?
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:56:00.242]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side
[00:56:03.197 --> 00:56:06.500]  Many a young maid lost her marbles to the night rain.
[00:56:09.102 --> 00:56:12.404]  Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.
[00:56:14.886 --> 00:56:18.569]  The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five.
[00:56:20.350 --> 00:56:22.171]  But I am still alive.
[00:56:22.192 --> 00:56:24.093]  I was a sailor.
[00:56:24.293 --> 00:56:26.595]  I was born upon the tide.
[00:56:33.937 --> 00:56:35.877]  Well, you see, I did a buy.
[00:56:36.598 --> 00:56:41.979]  I sailed a schooner around the Horn of Mexico.
[00:56:44.539 --> 00:56:48.600]  I went along the world and made so little flow.
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:55.861]  And when the yards broke off, they said that I got killed.
[00:56:55.921 --> 00:56:57.562]  But I'm living still.
[00:57:02.592 --> 00:57:12.518]  I was a dam builder across a river deep and wide where steel and water did collide.
[00:57:14.399 --> 00:57:17.801]  A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado.
[00:57:20.142 --> 00:57:23.504]  I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below.
[00:57:25.125 --> 00:57:28.267]  They buried me and I scraped and left no sign.
[00:57:31.371 --> 00:57:32.813]  But I am still around.
[00:57:34.875 --> 00:57:40.081]  I'll always be around, and around, and around, and around.
[00:57:49.556 --> 00:58:16.516]  I'll fly a starship across the universe divine And when I reach the other side I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can Perhaps I may become a highwayman again Or I may simply be a single drop of rain

[00:58:50.706 --> 00:58:53.269]  Hemp, the superfood for you and your family.
[00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:56.953]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[00:58:57.414 --> 00:59:00.858]  Hemp, used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[00:59:01.199 --> 00:59:08.287]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:59:08.627 --> 00:59:11.889]  Our Founding Fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[00:59:12.169 --> 00:59:16.011]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[00:59:16.351 --> 00:59:20.673]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments.
[00:59:21.034 --> 00:59:27.437]  Loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[00:59:27.757 --> 00:59:32.081]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[00:59:32.281 --> 00:59:34.143]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?
[00:59:34.403 --> 00:59:40.628]  Call today at 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.

[00:59:53.072 --> 00:59:54.974]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.454 --> 00:59:58.256]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.703 --> 01:00:06.383]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.004 --> 01:00:08.165]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.785 --> 01:00:09.906]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.547 --> 01:00:11.367]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:13.109]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.669 --> 01:00:17.332]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.873 --> 01:00:21.916]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.505 --> 01:00:26.107]  We are going to change Los Angeles.
[01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:42.530]  And of course, Adam, who's running the camera, Stuart, did the interview.
[01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:46.891]  Now, they're having trouble transferring this over, so they're going to get to another computer.
[01:00:47.191 --> 01:00:51.572]  It is intelligible a lot better when it's not over a phone up to a speaker.
[01:00:51.652 --> 01:00:52.892]  But people want this now.
[01:00:52.932 --> 01:00:54.153]  We need to get this out there now.
[01:00:54.573 --> 01:00:56.533]  By the third hour, we are going to have this.
[01:00:56.673 --> 01:01:02.095]  After Stuart plays this, he's going to leave and then go to a place to get this uploaded to our FTP site so we can get it out.
[01:01:02.435 --> 01:01:03.895]  I just talked to Charlie during the last break.
[01:01:03.915 --> 01:01:06.136]  There's a lot of wild stuff going on.
[01:01:06.176 --> 01:01:07.496]  That's why I ducked out for a moment.
[01:01:08.056 --> 01:01:12.979]  Uh, but, uh, ladies and gentlemen, uh, this is, uh, uh, well, Adam, let's go ahead and bring Adam out.
[01:01:13.199 --> 01:01:13.399]  Adam?
[01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:14.940]  Hi, how are you, Alex?
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.561]  Adam, I'm so wild today, I forgot.
[01:01:16.581 --> 01:01:17.701]  Do you want your last name out there?
[01:01:18.482 --> 01:01:19.262]  Uh, yeah, that's fine.
[01:01:19.302 --> 01:01:20.263]  My last name is Ruff.
[01:01:20.863 --> 01:01:21.303]  R-U-F-F.
[01:01:21.623 --> 01:01:22.124]  Fantastic.
[01:01:22.224 --> 01:01:24.125]  Adam Ruff, you were there, you videotaped this.
[01:01:24.705 --> 01:01:26.106]  Uh, let's just go ahead and play this.
[01:01:26.146 --> 01:01:32.929]  Now, there's a big crowd of people up on the stage at the end of an anti-war rally, but you can listen carefully in here, and it's a lot clearer when you actually have the audio.
[01:01:33.429 --> 01:01:34.490]  Uh, but, uh, here it is.
[01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:35.170]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:01:35.631 --> 01:01:36.331]  Okay, rolling.
[01:01:40.825 --> 01:01:53.916]  Okay, stop right there.
[01:01:54.056 --> 01:01:54.617]  Stop right there.
[01:01:54.737 --> 01:01:54.977]  Adam.
[01:01:55.517 --> 01:01:55.738]  Adam.
[01:01:56.338 --> 01:01:56.939]  He's not going to know.
[01:01:56.959 --> 01:01:57.499]  Put him on hold.
[01:01:57.839 --> 01:01:59.301]  This always happens with these phone things.
[01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.783]  We had it good earlier, but now it's too low.
[01:02:01.823 --> 01:02:03.644]  Have him turn the television way up.
[01:02:04.265 --> 01:02:05.286]  Is Adam back yet?
[01:02:07.955 --> 01:02:13.279]  Okay, we're going to go ahead and just wait until he's done, then we're going to come back to it and have him rewind.
[01:02:13.299 --> 01:02:14.640]  Again, we're doing everything we can.
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:15.780]  We're alternative media.
[01:02:16.081 --> 01:02:19.303]  We've got citizen activist media people out there who I cannot commend enough.
[01:02:19.683 --> 01:02:25.047]  The audio is very clear on the actual video, but doing it this way is tough.
[01:02:28.732 --> 01:02:37.794]  As soon as he comes back, and we're only playing a two minute clip right now, we'll be able to have him rewind that, go to break, do some more testing, and try to get that to you on the other side.
[01:02:38.274 --> 01:02:47.677]  Again, we are Change LA Saturday, Dr. Martin Sheen and others, and it is just amazing what he said about 9-11 truth.
[01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:49.177]  The media is going to try to spin this.
[01:02:51.064 --> 01:02:57.386]  Yeah, the audio is too low now, so we're going to break here in just a moment, Adam, and then we're going to test it during that three-minute break, and we'll come back with a little bit hotter.
[01:02:57.426 --> 01:03:07.268]  So, if you can, just rewind it to the start again so we can do the test, and then go ahead and just turn that television up a little bit more, and let's get the receiver on the phone up a little bit closer, okay?
[01:03:07.568 --> 01:03:07.828]  Okay.
[01:03:08.508 --> 01:03:09.089]  Fantastic.
[01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:13.750]  I really appreciate you doing that, and again, I know this is really stressful for folks that just jumped into this.
[01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:16.170]  Adam, how long have you been involved in the fight for 9-11 Truth?
[01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:18.631]  Since 2002, Alex.
[01:03:19.737 --> 01:03:21.218]  Oh, so you're a Mossback.
[01:03:21.238 --> 01:03:22.378]  You're a war horse in this.
[01:03:22.638 --> 01:03:22.999]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:23.679 --> 01:03:28.141]  Been involved since Theory Mason's original book, Pentagate.
[01:03:29.361 --> 01:03:37.225]  That's how I got started into it, but I'm more interested in the controlled demolitions of the towers and
[01:03:38.308 --> 01:03:39.669]  I'm getting that information out now.
[01:03:55.561 --> 01:04:02.769]  There is an article up on PrisonPlanet.com with it right now, and we will have the better audio for you transferred digitally, but this is all moving in real time here.
[01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:07.655]  I didn't want to wait for him to go out and get in the car and drive somewhere else, and maybe that not happen during the broadcast.
[01:04:07.695 --> 01:04:11.479]  I wanted to bring you this now, and I'm very thankful for Adam doing that.
[01:04:11.499 --> 01:04:12.260]  So Adam, right now...
[01:04:13.047 --> 01:04:13.847]  He's queuing that up.
[01:04:14.087 --> 01:04:21.690]  As soon as he's ready, John, you can start testing it, engaging it yourself, and I'll double-check it during the settings during the next break to try to get the best transmission of this audio.
[01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:23.811]  But I can tell once it's jacked up, you're going to be able to hear it clearly.
[01:04:24.311 --> 01:04:26.712]  Just focusing on the voices, not all the background noise.
[01:04:27.413 --> 01:04:32.995]  I need to... I'm going to send you guys a wireless microphone, or a handheld, or something to plug into those cameras.
[01:04:33.515 --> 01:04:34.835]  That's why I sent We Are Change New York.
[01:04:34.875 --> 01:04:36.196]  I think six cameras total now.
[01:04:37.347 --> 01:04:39.188]  Other folks donated spy cameras and the rest of it.
[01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:43.411]  Because these people are doing yeoman's work, God's work out there in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:04:43.672 --> 01:04:45.533]  And I salute them and totally commend them.
[01:04:45.553 --> 01:04:48.935]  The revolution, ladies and gentlemen, will be televised on the internet.
[01:04:49.255 --> 01:04:50.196]  And it's happening right now.
[01:04:50.256 --> 01:04:51.437]  So everybody you know, tune in.
[01:04:51.697 --> 01:04:52.678]  This is historic stuff.
[01:04:52.698 --> 01:04:59.923]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.644 --> 01:05:03.045]  It is a big idea.
[01:05:04.126 --> 01:05:05.167]  A New World Order.
[01:05:05.887 --> 01:05:06.808]  In the near future.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.903]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:05:10.943 --> 01:05:12.964]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:05:13.444 --> 01:05:15.826]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[01:05:16.367 --> 01:05:18.828]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:26.894]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:05:29.901 --> 01:05:34.904]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:05:35.365 --> 01:05:38.847]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:05:39.207 --> 01:05:41.729]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:05:41.769 --> 01:05:42.930]  Most people have no idea.
[01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:43.690]  They're not after money.
[01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:44.791]  They have all the money they need.
[01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:45.752]  They're after power.
[01:05:45.992 --> 01:05:46.812]  That's what I have to do, sir.

[01:06:56.818 --> 01:06:59.421]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:05.202]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:07:05.602 --> 01:07:08.544]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:07:08.864 --> 01:07:11.425]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:07:11.785 --> 01:07:16.607]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:07:16.987 --> 01:07:22.370]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:25.631]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[01:07:25.811 --> 01:07:26.391]  We're good to go.
[01:07:49.222 --> 01:07:50.744]  Martin Sheen says he questions the official 9-11 story.
[01:08:13.684 --> 01:08:18.865]  Mark Ruffalo says the same thing in two interviews done Saturday in an anti-war rally.
[01:08:18.885 --> 01:08:20.645]  That's why you hear incredible background noise.
[01:08:20.665 --> 01:08:23.506]  We're going to get a better digital copy uploaded in the next hour.
[01:08:23.846 --> 01:08:25.326]  You will hear it here, Lord willing.
[01:08:26.286 --> 01:08:34.288]  And right now, we're doing this via phone line, literally, you know, up to the speaker on the television, playing the tape right off the camera with the activist.
[01:08:36.108 --> 01:08:38.208]  And we appreciate Adam coming on with us.
[01:08:38.368 --> 01:08:41.889]  Adam, go ahead and play the tape, my friend.
[01:08:42.329 --> 01:08:42.869]  Okay, will do.
[01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:47.055]  You know, I don't know what to do.
[01:08:47.115 --> 01:08:50.116]  You know, there was a lot of questions about it.
[01:08:50.136 --> 01:08:52.597]  You introduced me to a lot of information.
[01:09:07.461 --> 01:09:10.863]  Until then, which is just like last year, I was very guilty.
[01:09:10.883 --> 01:09:14.625]  But we do not want to believe that my government was involved in this.
[01:09:14.645 --> 01:09:17.507]  Absolutely, I don't think any of us want to believe that.
[01:09:17.547 --> 01:09:21.189]  I could not live in a country that I thought was involved in that.
[01:09:21.289 --> 01:09:21.590]  Exactly.
[01:09:21.610 --> 01:09:22.930]  That would be most disgraceful.
[01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:26.172]  Then, however, there's been so many revelations that now I have my doubts.
[01:09:37.179 --> 01:09:38.660]  And again, that was a short clip.
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:41.401]  There's more coming later, right?
[01:09:41.421 --> 01:09:41.581]  Yes.
[01:09:41.601 --> 01:09:42.841]  Do you have more?
[01:09:42.901 --> 01:09:44.162]  Can we play more now?
[01:09:57.313 --> 01:10:00.116]  Uh, we can, but the audio's tough to hear, Alex.
[01:10:00.156 --> 01:10:01.718]  No, no, I'm hearing it clear.
[01:10:01.958 --> 01:10:03.940]  If you just tune out all the background noise, you can hear it.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:07.403]  I heard him just say, Building 7 is chief among it, the main thing.
[01:10:07.423 --> 01:10:07.984]  This is huge.
[01:10:08.024 --> 01:10:08.685]  Please continue.
[01:10:09.105 --> 01:10:09.345]  Okay.
[01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:09.906]  Here we go.
[01:10:21.539 --> 01:10:23.701]  That is a curiosity, isn't it?
[01:10:47.426 --> 01:10:48.428]  Okay Alex, that's it.
[01:10:49.109 --> 01:10:50.270]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:56.740]  Now when are we going to get all of the rest of it and the interview that you guys did with Mark Ruffalo?
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:01.382]  I'm headed over to get that uploaded for you, Alex.
[01:11:01.402 --> 01:11:02.763]  It's going to take about 20 minutes.
[01:11:03.183 --> 01:11:04.083]  All right, you're our champ.
[01:11:04.103 --> 01:11:04.864]  We're going to stay in there.
[01:11:04.904 --> 01:11:08.046]  Now, we have your cell phone number, too, or is this just your landline?
[01:11:08.466 --> 01:11:11.148]  This is my landline, but you do have my cell.
[01:11:11.168 --> 01:11:15.330]  Let me double check that, put you on hold, and please give the producer in Minnesota.
[01:11:15.890 --> 01:11:19.212]  That is a backup, and then we will talk to you in the next hour.
[01:11:19.232 --> 01:11:21.093]  Okay, quick correction, Alex.
[01:11:21.874 --> 01:11:25.396]  The cameraman on the Martin Sheen interview was Drew Piper.
[01:11:25.596 --> 01:11:27.457]  Okay, and you're the cameraman on Martin Sheen?
[01:11:28.792 --> 01:11:29.373]  No, no, no.
[01:11:30.113 --> 01:11:34.117]  The cameraman for Martin Sheen was Drew Piper.
[01:11:34.337 --> 01:11:34.718]  Sure, sure.
[01:11:34.738 --> 01:11:36.539]  Go ahead.
[01:11:38.481 --> 01:11:39.222]  You were the what, Adam?
[01:11:39.942 --> 01:11:40.143]  Yes.
[01:11:41.364 --> 01:11:42.565]  You were clarifying, you were what?
[01:11:43.457 --> 01:11:46.478]  I was the interviewer of Mark Ruffalo.
[01:11:46.818 --> 01:11:48.058]  Okay, now I've got it all straight.
[01:11:48.078 --> 01:11:49.198]  So many great We Are Changers.
[01:11:49.559 --> 01:11:51.199]  I get it confused out there in Los Angeles.
[01:11:51.359 --> 01:11:53.920]  We're going to double check your cell and call in.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.100]  We're going to give you the hotline number.
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:02.442]  John, give him the hotline and the extension to call us as soon as it's uploaded to get him back on with the full interview and a lot clearer audio.
[01:12:02.762 --> 01:12:03.842]  I salute you and thank you.
[01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:04.922]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:12:05.242 --> 01:12:07.003]  Alright, absolutely amazing.
[01:12:07.043 --> 01:12:07.883]  Get all that, John.
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:11.301]  Man, this is exciting.
[01:12:11.321 --> 01:12:24.786]  You go to PrisonPlanet.com, Martin Sheen, questions, official 9-11 story, and it's even stronger than the article Paul's got up there because we were just being careful because there he is saying, that's his, you know, how did they wire the building to bring it down?
[01:12:25.126 --> 01:12:25.926]  How did they do that?
[01:12:25.986 --> 01:12:30.308]  Why did BBC, I would add, report that the building had fallen before it fell?
[01:12:30.328 --> 01:12:31.468]  This is going to get a lot of attention.
[01:12:31.508 --> 01:12:37.791]  We need to make sure that all our evidence is in there so when people read this story they see all the evidence of why Martin Sheen, Charlie Sheen,
[01:12:38.411 --> 01:12:39.192]  I'm right here Alex.
[01:12:39.212 --> 01:12:44.156]  I think it's unbelievably exciting and I'm curious as to what Charlie's take was on this.
[01:12:59.358 --> 01:13:00.899]  Well, I talked to him for about three minutes.
[01:13:00.919 --> 01:13:01.939]  It was a private conversation.
[01:13:02.859 --> 01:13:09.502]  He's been very interesting, obviously, and I've got to talk to him during some of the breaks, and at the end of the show today, he was unaware of this.
[01:13:09.822 --> 01:13:10.362]  Right, right.
[01:13:10.562 --> 01:13:11.482]  And that's all I can say.
[01:13:11.502 --> 01:13:15.244]  Excellent.
[01:13:15.284 --> 01:13:16.064]  Just incredible.
[01:13:16.084 --> 01:13:18.745]  Yeah, isn't it great stuff?
[01:13:19.425 --> 01:13:21.606]  Yeah, that's why I had to take that call, because Charlie's so busy.
[01:13:21.886 --> 01:13:24.447]  He's been preparing all week for the show, and he's just gotten out to the show.
[01:13:25.313 --> 01:13:25.793]  We're good to go.
[01:13:50.658 --> 01:13:53.799]  Oh man, but that isn't what this was.
[01:13:53.819 --> 01:14:00.000]  We have some other people waiting in the wings too that we can't talk about, so I think the dam may be getting ready to break open a little bit more.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:00.380]  You're right.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.640]  Well, and again, I didn't leak that.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:08.182]  That was already leaked by our good friend from Duran Duran and of course the restauranteur there.
[01:14:08.202 --> 01:14:08.502]  Right, right.
[01:14:08.642 --> 01:14:12.822]  His offices are in the same building with dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[01:14:13.363 --> 01:14:20.144]  But, oh man, I just, again, they're going to have so much trouble dealing with this.
[01:14:21.076 --> 01:14:23.277]  And again, it's life and death situation to get this out.
[01:14:23.297 --> 01:14:24.478]  That's why I'm so excited.
[01:14:24.798 --> 01:14:36.446]  You're going to see, with Rosie O'Donnell and all this, and Christina Ebersole, and just so many others, and all these engineers, hundreds and hundreds, and physicists, and everybody going public, and generals, and everybody speaking out.
[01:14:36.466 --> 01:14:37.586]  I mean, this is getting insane!
[01:14:37.926 --> 01:14:44.651]  Absolutely, and you know, there's a video out now by this lovely girl, Naomi Wolf, and she talks about tipping points being reached.
[01:14:45.251 --> 01:14:49.814]  And it looks like, you know, we're starting to reach a little bit of a critical mass tipping point, and things are coming around to
[01:14:50.393 --> 01:14:54.436]  To be heavily weighted on our side, even though it's not being portrayed that way in the mainstream media.
[01:14:54.537 --> 01:14:56.718]  And in the Info War, it could happen any day.
[01:14:57.019 --> 01:15:05.386]  That photon torpedo could go right down the exhaust shaft, and the Death Star could go boom, and literally people will start going to prison.
[01:15:05.426 --> 01:15:07.808]  It's on an all-split, wide open.
[01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:11.371]  Unbelievable!
[01:15:11.691 --> 01:15:11.971]  Yeah.
[01:15:12.392 --> 01:15:14.974]  We have to believe that that can happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:21.022]  I'm telling you, Martin Sheen may just be our due sex in all of this, because he's highly respected.
[01:15:21.062 --> 01:15:21.842]  I mean, he's real.
[01:15:21.862 --> 01:15:32.087]  I mean, we've already had, you know, so many other people that have spoken out and questioned the official story, but they somehow ignored Ed Asner.
[01:15:32.467 --> 01:15:42.592]  And I've gotten to know Ed Asner, talked to him quite a bit off-air, not just on-air, and, you know, he's anti-vaccine, he's anti-New World Order, but when you hear about him on the news, it's that he's a Marxist-Leninist.
[01:15:42.632 --> 01:15:43.372]  It's not even true!
[01:15:44.648 --> 01:15:45.729]  I mean, I know these people.
[01:15:46.029 --> 01:15:49.770]  I know a lot of them in their homes, and they're not who you think they are.
[01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:51.911]  I mean, they're drinking whole milk.
[01:15:51.931 --> 01:15:52.972]  They're anti-vaccine.
[01:15:52.992 --> 01:15:54.112]  They're anti-New World Order.
[01:15:54.993 --> 01:15:57.974]  I mean, look at Jenny McCarthy going public about the autism now.
[01:15:58.414 --> 01:15:59.154]  Oprah Winfrey.
[01:15:59.435 --> 01:16:01.796]  They are not going to stop the truth from coming out!
[01:16:04.077 --> 01:16:05.077]  And they're shaking up about it.
[01:16:05.097 --> 01:16:05.697]  You can see it.
[01:16:05.717 --> 01:16:07.518]  I don't know if you saw Bill Maher last Friday.
[01:16:07.538 --> 01:16:08.679]  He was a little bit shaken up.
[01:16:09.319 --> 01:16:10.019]  I didn't watch it.
[01:16:10.059 --> 01:16:11.420]  I was doing some radio interview.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.621]  I'm just not in the habit of watching TV.
[01:16:13.661 --> 01:16:14.101]  What happened?
[01:16:14.908 --> 01:16:16.129]  Well, he came on.
[01:16:16.529 --> 01:16:17.810]  Actually, they had thrown me out.
[01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:20.172]  I was trying to get in because I hadn't been in for the first action.
[01:16:20.192 --> 01:16:31.360]  I was kind of waiting in reserves and they pulled me out of the line and pulled me aside and I was surrounded by these very much Blackwater type guys and they opened up a little book of papers and they said, is this you?
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:37.945]  Oh, there's no doubt they're doing research now and watching you on the web and watching us on the web.
[01:16:37.965 --> 01:16:40.006]  I didn't know, but this is huge news right here.
[01:16:40.046 --> 01:16:40.607]  Tell me about it.
[01:16:40.807 --> 01:16:41.868]  Well, it gets better.
[01:16:41.908 --> 01:16:43.169]  So they said, is this you?
[01:16:43.229 --> 01:16:44.810]  I said, oh gee, my first mugshot.
[01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:45.550]  That's great.
[01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:46.831]  Did you guys see the video?
[01:16:46.931 --> 01:16:50.794]  And a couple of them almost started to laugh because they apparently had seen it.
[01:16:51.615 --> 01:16:54.237]  But, you know, I just said, OK, well, I guess, you know.
[01:16:55.319 --> 01:16:56.119]  Uh, we gotta go.
[01:16:56.159 --> 01:17:02.162]  They wouldn't let me in to see the show even though I had not been there before and I had not, you know, done anything other than make a funny video response.
[01:17:02.722 --> 01:17:14.167]  But, uh, we left and then I went home and watched the show and Bill Maher's first joke when he got out on stage was, uh, welcome everybody, uh, I'd like to introduce you to my new security team, Blackwater.
[01:17:15.547 --> 01:17:18.189]  And, uh, you know, it was a joke, but it wasn't a joke.
[01:17:18.269 --> 01:17:21.430]  And, uh, he kind of was off his game a little bit and
[01:17:22.392 --> 01:17:28.514]  And then to see a lot of the network, mainstream media, be a little bit off their game was kind of wild, you know?
[01:17:28.534 --> 01:17:30.674]  It was kind of wild to see that, and it's encouraging.
[01:17:32.075 --> 01:17:33.495]  Did he attack 9-11 Truth again?
[01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:47.439]  I think he was a lot more careful, and you could see he was very guarded in what he said about everything, and you could see him kind of hitting some, you know, some bad talking points that he was supposed to, apparently, you know, puppet some talking points.
[01:17:48.044 --> 01:17:49.767]  I don't think he did really attack us again.
[01:17:49.787 --> 01:17:56.740]  He's always controversial in a lot of the stuff he says, but I don't think he went back at us in an attack mode again.
[01:17:59.321 --> 01:17:59.942]  Absolutely.
[01:18:00.222 --> 01:18:03.045]  We've got a story developing on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:18:03.065 --> 01:18:07.569]  We're going to add to it the BBC poll building 7 before it even fell.
[01:18:07.589 --> 01:18:12.453]  They were saying it had already fallen and giving the official story that later came out showing it was scripted exactly.
[01:18:12.493 --> 01:18:14.535]  That's the big point to that new story.
[01:18:14.555 --> 01:18:17.959]  We're going to add the quotes from Martin Sheen that you read last hour.
[01:18:18.759 --> 01:18:27.973]  And we're going to add the little audio snips we just heard, but then later in the next hour when we get the quality audio and the longer audio, we're going to get that up as well.
[01:18:28.053 --> 01:18:29.315]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:18:29.415 --> 01:18:31.018]  Dig it to the top right now.
[01:18:31.078 --> 01:18:32.420]  Don't let the variable grade stop us.
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:33.501]  For those who don't know what it is, dig.
[01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:34.743]  We're good to go.
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:19:04.529]  Toe-to-toe combat with the New World Order and the Info War, and if you guys will just get off the bench, and you gals will get off the bench, like We Are Change is doing, and the Info Warriors are doing, we're going to win this thing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:04.609 --> 01:19:05.350]  Hoorah!
[01:19:07.852 --> 01:19:08.853]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:19:08.893 --> 01:19:09.914]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:19:11.014 --> 01:19:20.742]  Just like to say thank you to you, and everybody that inspired us, and thank you to the people in my group, and We Are Change LA, and everybody who's joining us all over the country and the planet.
[01:19:21.263 --> 01:19:22.704]  Thank you to everybody who's standing up.
[01:19:24.395 --> 01:19:25.156]  Absolutely.
[01:19:25.216 --> 01:19:29.321]  We need our own brigades in the Info War.
[01:19:29.461 --> 01:19:31.063]  Info Brigade L.A.
[01:19:31.583 --> 01:19:32.784]  Info Warrior Brigade.
[01:19:32.844 --> 01:19:34.226]  We Are Change Brigades.
[01:19:34.867 --> 01:19:35.968]  Everywhere in the Info War.
[01:19:35.988 --> 01:19:37.249]  It's what I've always been preaching.
[01:19:37.269 --> 01:19:38.310]  What I've always been doing.
[01:19:38.611 --> 01:19:39.572]  Getting in their faces.
[01:19:39.672 --> 01:19:40.553]  Getting aggressive.
[01:19:40.833 --> 01:19:41.794]  Taking action.
[01:19:41.894 --> 01:19:43.016]  Rallying other people.
[01:19:43.396 --> 01:19:44.237]  Being bold.
[01:19:45.026 --> 01:19:48.128]  And then others will follow suit, and that's happening.
[01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:53.112]  The chain reaction, the enemy of liberty is scared right now.
[01:19:53.573 --> 01:19:54.433]  Endgame is out.
[01:19:54.673 --> 01:19:59.197]  See it right now at PrisonPlanet.tv or get your DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:20:01.548 --> 01:20:05.893]  Ted Anderson reminds us that October 24, 2007, gold 786 50 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $810.39, $399.45 for half, $199.73 per quarter.
[01:20:05.913 --> 01:20:06.393]  That's $810.39, $399.45, and $199.73.
[01:20:16.613 --> 01:20:18.815]  The dollar has fallen to 65% of the euro.
[01:20:18.915 --> 01:20:19.955]  Erosion accelerates.
[01:20:20.035 --> 01:20:27.440]  Mainline talk show hosts are trying to hold on to their support of the conservative movement, keeping focus on the Republican agenda and playing into the hand of the globalists.
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:30.962]  Dr. Corsi interviewed Robert Pastor of the American University.
[01:20:31.123 --> 01:20:37.687]  With the sleight of hand and incremental implementation, Pastor admits to the North American Union is being forced upon us.
[01:20:38.147 --> 01:20:42.809]  Corsi uncovers the CFR's plan to build a North American community similar to the EU.
[01:20:43.129 --> 01:20:48.352]  In his report, the North American Union isn't going away, Corsi exposes the deception and trickery.
[01:20:48.472 --> 01:20:52.174]  Call for your report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.274 --> 01:20:55.535]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[01:20:55.655 --> 01:20:55.916]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:55.936 --> 01:20:56.116]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:21:01.804 --> 01:21:04.165]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:21:04.706 --> 01:21:06.166]  After a pedicure they look great.
[01:21:06.527 --> 01:21:10.349]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:21:10.789 --> 01:21:12.990]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:16.752]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:21:17.153 --> 01:21:19.634]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:21:20.134 --> 01:21:21.155]  What's that name again?
[01:21:21.575 --> 01:21:22.756]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:21:23.136 --> 01:21:24.276]  It's CalX.
[01:21:24.717 --> 01:21:26.538]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:21:26.898 --> 01:21:28.739]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[01:21:29.531 --> 01:21:38.133]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:21:38.573 --> 01:21:44.275]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:21:44.675 --> 01:21:55.798]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, HEB grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:57.561]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[01:21:57.901 --> 01:21:58.562]  I'll be right back.
[01:21:58.702 --> 01:22:00.423]  I'm getting some Calix for my heels.
[01:22:01.624 --> 01:22:03.085]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.

[01:22:17.837 --> 01:22:18.418]  We're good to go.

[01:22:46.123 --> 01:22:49.587]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[01:22:49.627 --> 01:22:50.828]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[01:23:01.056 --> 01:23:06.539]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:23:06.979 --> 01:23:11.782]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:23:11.882 --> 01:23:18.486]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:23:18.926 --> 01:23:25.633]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:23:25.953 --> 01:23:27.575]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:23:27.875 --> 01:23:31.059]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[01:23:48.037 --> 01:23:49.799]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:24:31.085 --> 01:24:34.927]  Well, Stuart Howell interviewed Martin Sheen.
[01:24:35.108 --> 01:24:39.691]  Been in Academy Award winning films, top TV shows, you name it.
[01:24:40.852 --> 01:24:45.535]  Headline on PrisonPlanet.com right now, Martin Sheen questions official 9-11 story.
[01:24:46.516 --> 01:24:48.958]  Follows in footsteps of son Charlie Sheen, highlights
[01:24:49.875 --> 01:24:52.296]  Implausible Collapse of Building 7 in NORAD Response.
[01:24:52.316 --> 01:24:56.436]  I know there's going to be a report on TruthNews.us by Kurt Nemo as well.
[01:24:56.976 --> 01:25:02.418]  And we need to get this posted on InfoWars.com and all the other sites right now as well.
[01:25:02.618 --> 01:25:07.199]  And I need your help to dig this up at the top of Dig so it becomes a huge story.
[01:25:07.759 --> 01:25:15.040]  Of course, the establishment media has already been contacting before I even knew about this because it's gotten out on some message boards and things last night.
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:16.240]  They're going to try to spin it.
[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:18.941]  Bottom line, actor Mark Desheen
[01:25:20.333 --> 01:25:27.878]  Has questioned the official 9-11 story, follows in footsteps of son Charlie Sheen highlights implausible collapse of Building 7 in Norad stand down response.
[01:25:30.099 --> 01:25:38.185]  Actor Martin Sheen questioned the official 9-11 story as well as the collapse of Building 7 in Norad's response to the 9-11 attacks during an anti-war march this past weekend in Los Angeles.
[01:25:39.065 --> 01:25:43.608]  Sheen was interviewed by We Are Change LA along with fellow actor Mark Rufalo.
[01:25:43.648 --> 01:25:46.650]  We need to get a link to We Are Change LA there.
[01:25:46.670 --> 01:25:47.531]  I know he wrote this quickly.
[01:25:47.551 --> 01:25:48.131]  We need to get that up.
[01:25:48.985 --> 01:25:51.866]  By the Answer Coalition, at which around 20,000 people attended.
[01:25:52.826 --> 01:26:07.171]  Emmy and Golden Globe award winning Martin Sheen, star of blockbuster films like Apocalypse Now and The West Wing, follows in the footsteps of his son Charlie Sheen, who publicly spoke on the doubts about the official story back in March of 2006.
[01:26:07.751 --> 01:26:09.011]  I guess it was in March, not April.
[01:26:10.011 --> 01:26:11.552]  Quote, there have been so many revelations
[01:26:13.075 --> 01:26:15.377]  That I have my doubts, and chief among them is Building 7.
[01:26:15.978 --> 01:26:21.163]  How did they rig that building so that it came down on the evening of that day, said Sheen?
[01:26:21.803 --> 01:26:35.196]  Though Fox News and other attack dogs are likely to seize upon Sheen's comments, and then to hit peace, the National Institute of Standards and Technology issued, had to issue, recently issue, and admit recently, that the total collapse of the Twin Towers at free-fall speed could not be explained.
[01:26:36.641 --> 01:26:37.961]  Full quotes and video to follow.
[01:26:38.041 --> 01:26:39.001]  Watch this space.
[01:26:39.722 --> 01:26:41.302]  And that story is going to continue to develop.
[01:26:41.322 --> 01:26:44.022]  Get it out to the four winds, the four corners of the earth.
[01:26:44.582 --> 01:26:46.603]  Get it out to everybody right now.
[01:26:47.303 --> 01:26:52.424]  This is an InfoWar DEFCON 5 emergency alert in the InfoWar.
[01:26:53.104 --> 01:26:55.064]  Because the domino effect is happening.
[01:26:55.104 --> 01:27:01.525]  George Carlin over the weekend talked about not believing the official story and questioning official proclamations and said there'd never be a true investigation of it.
[01:27:01.826 --> 01:27:03.426]  That the government wants to cover these things up.
[01:27:03.486 --> 01:27:04.066]  That's huge.
[01:27:05.895 --> 01:27:07.216]  The Mark Ruffalo is huge.
[01:27:07.336 --> 01:27:09.397]  This is a triple trifecta.
[01:27:10.237 --> 01:27:12.418]  And believe me, you're going to see more people go public.
[01:27:12.858 --> 01:27:15.599]  There's already huge Hollywood stars we know on the verge of speaking out.
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:22.181]  Just thank God we've got to expose these people or we're going to keep staging more terror attacks.
[01:27:22.982 --> 01:27:25.022]  This is so important right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:25.883 --> 01:27:27.463]  Stuart Howell interviewed Martin Sheen.
[01:27:28.604 --> 01:27:31.605]  I'm trying to get Luke Rudowsky on, the founder of We Are Change, to get his take on this.
[01:27:31.625 --> 01:27:33.566]  I know he's in college today, a young man, 21 years old.
[01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:36.236]  So much happening.
[01:27:37.197 --> 01:27:40.119]  The next days and weeks and months, it's going to be interesting, isn't it my friend?
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:41.420]  Absolutely.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:46.765]  I mean, I don't even, I'm actually speechless at this point.
[01:27:46.785 --> 01:27:48.346]  I don't think people realize what this means.
[01:27:48.386 --> 01:27:51.028]  I mean, how scared last week Glenn Beck looked.
[01:27:51.629 --> 01:28:01.197]  How scared that Anderson Cooper, not Anderson Cooper, Tucker Carlson looked, admitting that the many people, huge percentages of the American people believe it's an inside job.
[01:28:01.957 --> 01:28:04.298]  And saying that people don't believe the media anymore.
[01:28:04.338 --> 01:28:05.998]  We don't believe you anymore, that's right!
[01:28:06.018 --> 01:28:09.059]  And so there's an awakening happening.
[01:28:09.079 --> 01:28:10.260]  I mean, what say you?
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:17.022]  Well, you know, I think the light is illuminating the lies, and the lies can't stand.
[01:28:17.542 --> 01:28:20.062]  And, you know, there's no way to justify a lie.
[01:28:20.082 --> 01:28:21.743]  It won't hold up, and we're seeing that.
[01:28:21.783 --> 01:28:25.004]  It's coming down, and, you know, I think some of them
[01:28:25.635 --> 01:28:54.797]  People are spooked and I think there's people seeing that it's coming down and they're going to get on board with us because, you know, when the dust settles, you know, the truth is going to be out there and people are going to be held accountable and it's going to be the situation you don't want to be on the wrong side of and I think people are realizing the weight and gravity and the ramifications of the enormity of the situation and a lot of choices are being made right now of which side to take and I think a lot of people are going to be coming out and coming over and getting on board with
[01:28:55.293 --> 01:28:57.254]  With the truth and with goodness.
[01:28:59.255 --> 01:28:59.675]  I agree.
[01:28:59.815 --> 01:29:03.657]  At Dig.com, the Berry Brigade is in there giggling and snickering, trying to block us.
[01:29:03.837 --> 01:29:05.278]  It should have already gone to the main page.
[01:29:05.738 --> 01:29:06.238]  It hasn't.
[01:29:06.278 --> 01:29:07.319]  They're trying to block us.
[01:29:08.339 --> 01:29:09.200]  Do not let them win.
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:10.140]  Go register for Dig.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:10.641]  Go vote.
[01:29:10.961 --> 01:29:11.481]  Get in there.
[01:29:11.521 --> 01:29:12.682]  Drive it to their main page.
[01:29:13.162 --> 01:29:16.924]  Because this way, Fox News and CNN and all them won't be able to put their spin on this.
[01:29:17.244 --> 01:29:19.285]  The article's key because it has Martin Sheen
[01:29:20.902 --> 01:29:22.243]  They're with NIST.
[01:29:22.323 --> 01:29:25.766]  We have NIST just two weeks ago coming out and saying, yeah, fire couldn't have done this.
[01:29:26.166 --> 01:29:26.947]  We can't explain.
[01:29:26.967 --> 01:29:28.809]  They said a year ago they're looking at explosions.
[01:29:29.229 --> 01:29:29.689]  Explosives?
[01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:31.611]  We need to add that, that older report in there.
[01:29:32.251 --> 01:29:33.713]  And so, this is mainline.
[01:29:34.693 --> 01:29:36.715]  And we have all these other people speaking out.
[01:29:37.596 --> 01:29:39.517]  This is being pushed over the edge right now.
[01:29:40.758 --> 01:29:41.739]  Now is the time.
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:43.861]  Stay there, my friend.
[01:29:44.821 --> 01:29:45.502]  We're going to come back.
[01:29:45.522 --> 01:29:46.902]  We're also going to open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:29:46.962 --> 01:29:50.645]  In-game blueprint for Global Display is now out.
[01:29:50.665 --> 01:29:52.146]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.646 --> 01:29:54.247]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.168 --> 01:29:57.890]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.437 --> 01:30:04.378]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:30:04.538 --> 01:30:09.720]  How about fluorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:15.321]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:30:15.742 --> 01:30:16.882]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:17.242 --> 01:30:26.145]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:30:26.565 --> 01:30:28.167]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[01:31:08.956 --> 01:31:10.317]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:31:10.577 --> 01:31:18.759]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:32:07.859 --> 01:32:08.119]  Hemp.
[01:32:08.519 --> 01:32:11.281]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[01:32:11.641 --> 01:32:11.921]  Hemp.
[01:32:12.261 --> 01:32:18.744]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[01:32:19.064 --> 01:32:22.325]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[01:32:22.605 --> 01:32:26.067]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.com.
[01:32:26.067 --> 01:32:26.287]  I think so.

[01:33:51.269 --> 01:33:53.309]  You better get that to your head.
[01:33:53.549 --> 01:33:55.329]  Democracy don't rule the world.
[01:33:55.449 --> 01:33:57.930]  You better get that in your head.
[01:33:57.950 --> 01:34:00.931]  This world is a little bit violent.
[01:34:01.011 --> 01:34:01.911]  But I guess.
[01:34:02.151 --> 01:34:03.771]  It's better left unsaid.
[01:34:03.931 --> 01:34:06.012]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:06.052 --> 01:34:10.212]  From the Broadway to the Disney way.
[01:34:10.252 --> 01:34:14.133]  That's a lot of territory indeed.
[01:34:14.193 --> 01:34:16.214]  You know what?
[01:34:16.274 --> 01:34:17.914]  I want to salute
[01:34:18.991 --> 01:34:22.553]  Martin Sheen and everybody else that's gone public.
[01:34:23.294 --> 01:34:24.374]  But we are Change LA.
[01:34:24.394 --> 01:34:26.095]  We're going out and getting the interview.
[01:34:28.857 --> 01:34:30.278]  Mark Ruffalo, everybody.
[01:34:30.878 --> 01:34:34.160]  But right now, to salute all them, I want to play Everybody Knows.
[01:34:35.921 --> 01:34:43.766]  Let's just play a few minutes of that, then I'm going to go to all your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231, Steve in Colorado, Patrick in Texas, and others.
[01:34:44.026 --> 01:34:45.687]  And I hope it's about truth busting out.
[01:34:45.967 --> 01:34:46.768]  I hope it's about truth
[01:34:48.012 --> 01:34:48.613]  Taking action.
[01:34:48.633 --> 01:34:54.998]  I hope it's about people getting in the streets and getting in people's faces and getting aggressive for our liberty and saying, stop feeding off us, you criminals.
[01:34:55.018 --> 01:34:59.622]  Alright, you got that song ready?
[01:35:01.183 --> 01:35:01.404]  Yeah.
[01:35:02.164 --> 01:35:02.505]  Here it is.
[01:35:13.609 --> 01:35:14.891]  We're good to go.
[01:35:30.032 --> 01:35:34.276]  Everybody knows the fight is fixed.
[01:35:34.336 --> 01:35:36.558]  The poor stay poor.
[01:35:36.598 --> 01:35:38.480]  The rich get rich.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:40.763]  That's how it goes.
[01:35:41.023 --> 01:35:43.045]  Everybody knows.
[01:35:47.929 --> 01:35:52.652]  Everybody knows that the boat is leaking.
[01:35:53.052 --> 01:35:57.515]  Everybody knows the captain lied.
[01:35:57.695 --> 01:36:01.557]  Everybody got this broken feeling.
[01:36:01.637 --> 01:36:05.800]  Like their father or their dog just died.
[01:36:06.841 --> 01:36:10.685]  Everybody pockets to their pockets.
[01:36:11.466 --> 01:36:16.993]  Everybody wants a box of chocolates in the downstairs rooms.
[01:36:17.093 --> 01:36:18.115]  Everybody knows.
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:28.622]  We're good to go.
[01:36:43.403 --> 01:36:54.569]  Everybody knows you've been discreet but there were so many people you just had to beat without your clothes.
[01:36:54.689 --> 01:36:57.450]  And everybody knows.
[01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:59.031]  Everybody knows.
[01:36:59.111 --> 01:36:59.991]  Everybody knows.
[01:37:15.627 --> 01:37:26.310]  By the way, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement is officially out today.
[01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:28.571]  You can watch it at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:28.591 --> 01:37:30.832]  An incredible high quality, almost as good as DVD.
[01:37:31.452 --> 01:37:35.699]  Or support us and get the DVD at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:44.553]  Blueprint for global enslavement, the history of the global elite, their current operations, two Bilderberg Group conferences covered, 2006 and this year, of course, in Istanbul, Turkey.
[01:37:45.866 --> 01:37:59.753]  All covered, all documented, and then their plan, their neo-eugenics plan, how they're currently poisoning us, and the things they're doing to us, and all the secret chemical, biological, radiological tests they admit they did, so then you can then believe them when they say they plan to kill 80% of us.
[01:37:59.813 --> 01:38:01.694]  I mean, it's not like we're asking you to believe us.
[01:38:01.934 --> 01:38:02.934]  We have all the proof there.
[01:38:02.954 --> 01:38:04.235]  They're telling us what they're going to do.
[01:38:04.255 --> 01:38:06.796]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:38:06.836 --> 01:38:14.780]  Before I forget today, Ian Punnett was a sheer pleasure to be interviewed by a true gentleman,
[01:38:16.130 --> 01:38:16.690]  We're good to go.
[01:38:30.775 --> 01:38:34.718]  And that's a major chink of the New World Order, a place to, you know, get the truth out.
[01:38:34.738 --> 01:38:36.259]  And I'm very, very thankful for that.
[01:38:36.559 --> 01:38:38.240]  And I'm very, very thankful to Ian Punnett.
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:42.143]  Ian was telling me, he was getting hundreds of emails, people being mean beforehand, saying, you better be nice to him.
[01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:44.124]  He was very, very fair, very, very nice.
[01:38:44.144 --> 01:38:58.273]  So thank you, Ian Punnett, and Coast to Coast AM, and George Norrie, and Lisa Lyon, and Lex Lonehood, and Sean, and Tom Danheiser, and everybody that runs those fabulous shows for having me on, having other truthers on, and letting me warn the world about what's happening.
[01:38:59.082 --> 01:39:00.023]  That was a huge victory.
[01:39:00.483 --> 01:39:06.628]  I literally prayed before the show that God would guide me to be well-spoken and focused, and I think I was pretty well-spoken and focused.
[01:39:07.489 --> 01:39:10.912]  And I've been seeing the response in the PrisonPlanet.com forums.
[01:39:10.972 --> 01:39:13.694]  I had a big stack of questions in there I wanted to go over, but there's never time.
[01:39:13.994 --> 01:39:18.898]  But I am reading and I am looking at it, and I want to thank all of you for that.
[01:39:19.018 --> 01:39:24.903]  But little did we know that Saturday that WeAreChangeLA.org had done what they had done.
[01:39:24.923 --> 01:39:28.566]  And again, I salute them for taking action.
[01:39:30.054 --> 01:39:32.357]  You ready to take some calls, Stuart?
[01:39:33.238 --> 01:39:33.718]  Let's do it.
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:36.481]  Alright, who's up first here?
[01:39:38.864 --> 01:39:40.706]  Stephen Colorado, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:39:41.807 --> 01:39:42.808]  Yeah, hey there Alex.
[01:39:43.069 --> 01:39:47.934]  Hey, I just wanted to say, yeah, another good job on Coast to Coast.
[01:39:48.875 --> 01:39:50.176]  And that lady had
[01:39:51.344 --> 01:40:08.350]  There was one lady that called in and said that she couldn't follow you, and it's not because you're confusing, it's just that you hit it kind of right in the middle of the deal there, and unless you're prepared for what you're going to say or have a kind of basic outline of what's going on, it is going to be hard to follow.
[01:40:09.474 --> 01:40:10.995]  You mean just gauging the truth?
[01:40:11.055 --> 01:40:14.658]  I mean, the average American can't find, you know, one-fifth can't find the U.S.
[01:40:14.698 --> 01:40:19.202]  on a map, so here I am getting into complex geopolitical strata, history, integrated fields.
[01:40:19.842 --> 01:40:20.503]  Yeah, I understand.
[01:40:20.863 --> 01:40:22.204]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:40:22.525 --> 01:40:28.990]  And also I wanted to mention, on the New American Century website,
[01:40:30.528 --> 01:40:32.631]  Maybe you're aware of this, but I wanted to mention it.
[01:40:33.111 --> 01:40:42.545]  On the document, Rebuilding America's Defenses, they had changed the authorship of that document from Cheney to some other people.
[01:40:43.406 --> 01:40:51.734]  I don't know if you're aware of that, but they had... Well, originally Dick Cheney was listed with three other authors on there and was reported, and he said he was the primary progenitor of it.
[01:40:51.774 --> 01:40:52.755]  You mean they've changed that?
[01:40:53.155 --> 01:40:55.237]  Yeah, they took Dick Cheney's name off of it.
[01:40:56.178 --> 01:41:01.163]  That was a couple or so years ago, but originally they had Cheney's name, but then they took it off of it.
[01:41:01.183 --> 01:41:03.765]  Ooh, we can find that in the archives and show how they did that.
[01:41:04.926 --> 01:41:05.066]  What?
[01:41:05.126 --> 01:41:05.787]  I'm sorry, say again?
[01:41:06.852 --> 01:41:08.333]  If we have the time, somebody ought to do it.
[01:41:08.373 --> 01:41:12.356]  We can go find the old article they put out and then show how they took his name off of it.
[01:41:12.716 --> 01:41:16.519]  I just want to give you a heads up on that, because I wasn't sure if you were aware of that.
[01:41:16.759 --> 01:41:20.942]  But I have three questions for you, right quick.
[01:41:21.002 --> 01:41:29.728]  You had mentioned on Ian Punnett's program that Bilderbergers had come up with the Club of Rome.
[01:41:29.748 --> 01:41:31.649]  I was wondering, first of all,
[01:41:32.205 --> 01:41:32.365]  Yes.
[01:41:32.585 --> 01:41:34.968]  Again, the Bilderberg Group truly operated before 54.
[01:41:35.028 --> 01:41:38.011]  Westbrook-Prager reported on the 40s and 50s, as we cover in the film.
[01:41:47.606 --> 01:41:48.767]  And the same thing with Club of Rome.
[01:41:48.787 --> 01:41:54.251]  They'd already had an environmental stewardship group that was going to try to reduce population and come up and push world taxes.
[01:41:54.671 --> 01:41:56.332]  Kind of a subgroup of Bilderberg.
[01:41:56.793 --> 01:41:59.975]  And I'd read in different documents in several places.
[01:41:59.995 --> 01:42:03.738]  I can't remember exactly where at the time, but in the year of research for the film.
[01:42:04.338 --> 01:42:06.119]  And then Club of Rome talks about Bilderberg.
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:09.062]  That the top members of Bilderberg founded it.
[01:42:09.662 --> 01:42:13.064]  And I believe Club of Rome was founded in 1961.
[01:42:13.405 --> 01:42:14.606]  But I'm going from memory on that.
[01:42:14.626 --> 01:42:15.426]  Just check it out for yourself.
[01:42:15.486 --> 01:42:16.527]  It's on the Club of Rome website.
[01:42:17.282 --> 01:42:17.502]  Is it?
[01:42:17.642 --> 01:42:18.002]  Oh, okay.
[01:42:18.342 --> 01:42:18.662]  All right.
[01:42:18.742 --> 01:42:28.025]  And then the next thing was, you had just mentioned a few minutes ago about a NIST, the National, what, Industrial Standards Techno... National Institutes of Standards and Technology.
[01:42:28.405 --> 01:42:28.706]  Okay.
[01:42:28.946 --> 01:42:36.168]  What date was that report that said that they couldn't explain the Twin Towers imploding?
[01:42:36.888 --> 01:42:37.668]  Do you know?
[01:42:37.708 --> 01:42:38.669]  Yes, I'm trying.
[01:42:40.269 --> 01:42:41.830]  That was two weeks ago they put that out.
[01:42:41.850 --> 01:42:44.050]  Let me go to presentplanet.com.
[01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.450]  Hold on.
[01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:44.851]  Hold on.
[01:42:44.871 --> 01:42:45.571]  I'm going to get it for you.
[01:42:47.507 --> 01:42:50.188]  Let me click on it, and I have to click through to the actual report.
[01:42:50.228 --> 01:42:50.969]  That's the problem.
[01:42:52.510 --> 01:42:56.271]  I meant to print that off this morning, but... Okay, so it is on a website?
[01:42:56.291 --> 01:42:57.452]  Hold on, let me just stop you.
[01:42:57.552 --> 01:43:00.894]  Yes, if you go to PrisonPlanet.com Okay.
[01:43:00.974 --> 01:43:02.534]  Like, I can't surf and talk at the same time.
[01:43:02.935 --> 01:43:03.135]  Sure.
[01:43:03.815 --> 01:43:15.621]  If you go to PrisonPlanet.com, Martin Sheen questions official 9-11 story, follows in footsteps of son Charlie Sheen, highlights implausible collapse of Building 7 and Silverstein comments, and if you scroll down,
[01:43:16.588 --> 01:43:22.733]  You can find the link to the PrisonPlanet.com article from a few weeks ago.
[01:43:22.773 --> 01:43:23.753]  It's loading now.
[01:43:23.793 --> 01:43:24.914]  Let me just read it to you.
[01:43:24.994 --> 01:43:28.577]  We do have Luke Radowski waiting in the wings, and I will get to your calls, and I appreciate your call.
[01:43:28.597 --> 01:43:30.979]  I'm going to let you go, Steve, while I answer your third question.
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:38.164]  NIST admits total collapse of Twin Towers unexplainable.
[01:43:38.564 --> 01:43:43.648]  Implicitly acknowledges control demolition only means by which towers could have fallen at freefall speed.
[01:43:44.705 --> 01:43:49.268]  October 16, 2007, almost two weeks ago.
[01:43:49.288 --> 01:43:52.450]  And again, I appreciate your call, Steve.
[01:43:53.311 --> 01:44:09.862]  It says, the National Institute for Standards and Technology has been forced to admit that the total freefall collapse of the Twin Towers cannot be explained after an exhaustive scientific study, implicitly acknowledging the control demolition is only means by which buildings could have gone down.
[01:44:10.403 --> 01:44:12.084]  In a recent PDF link,
[01:44:12.939 --> 01:44:16.460]  The 9-11 victims' representatives, Bill Doyle and Bob McElveen.
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.941]  Again, Bill Doyle on the show, head of the biggest group.
[01:44:18.981 --> 01:44:21.622]  He says over half the members believe it's an inside job a year ago.
[01:44:22.602 --> 01:44:26.724]  We are unable to provide a full explanation for the total collapse.
[01:44:27.004 --> 01:44:38.688]  A 10,000-page scientific study only refers to theories as to how the collapse initiation preceded the falls to address how it was possible for part of the WTC structure to fall through the path of most resistance.
[01:44:39.248 --> 01:44:46.514]  And in another report from a year ago, I'm trying to find that, it's a lengthy article, and Paul's posting all those in the new article, links directly to them.
[01:44:46.955 --> 01:44:50.938]  Remember, they said they are having to look at secondary explosions for triggering that.
[01:44:51.499 --> 01:44:53.901]  What do you think of that information, Stuart?
[01:44:54.822 --> 01:44:55.682]  I think it's phenomenal.
[01:44:55.802 --> 01:44:56.523]  It's getting out there.
[01:44:57.904 --> 01:45:01.487]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to put all this in plain language in the article.
[01:45:01.547 --> 01:45:04.130]  Paul has been writing this while we have been on air.
[01:45:05.945 --> 01:45:13.928]  And I'm trying in his article to find the report from a year ago, but it's all over the place where they said they were looking at explosives in the towers.
[01:45:13.968 --> 01:45:18.170]  Let's bring up Luke Radowsky, and then we'll start taking some calls as well, just to the network.
[01:45:18.190 --> 01:45:20.691]  We'll be able to have Stewart, Luke, and callers on, correct?
[01:45:21.405 --> 01:45:21.905]  Okay, okay.
[01:45:22.006 --> 01:45:23.647]  There may be some feedback, but we'll adjust for that.
[01:45:24.307 --> 01:45:25.288]  Let's go to Luke Godowsky.
[01:45:25.588 --> 01:45:38.558]  Luke, I wanted to bring you on for this celebration of getting Martin Sheen to speak out, and of course another big star, Mark Ruffalo, and of course at the same time we are changing New York, talking to George Carlin, saying he doesn't mind an official story.
[01:45:38.598 --> 01:45:44.182]  That is a trifecta, and we may see some other big stars go public very soon.
[01:45:44.202 --> 01:45:46.424]  And that's what it's about, man.
[01:45:46.464 --> 01:45:49.026]  It's about just bringing the people out there, man.
[01:45:49.086 --> 01:45:50.867]  Talking to people, educating people, and that's what
[01:45:51.175 --> 01:45:52.356]  You know, we are change-a-late.
[01:45:52.396 --> 01:45:55.938]  That's what we did here in New York City, talking to George Carlin.
[01:45:56.379 --> 01:46:00.161]  And it's a beautiful thing seeing mainstream celebrity people coming out for the truth.
[01:46:00.862 --> 01:46:05.925]  They have a lot of pull, they have a lot of say, they have a lot of power, and it's beautiful seeing these people coming out with the truth.
[01:46:05.945 --> 01:46:19.655]  Well, I've always said that if they, a bunch of them, and believe me, I've been at a few Hollywood functions and talked to quite a few big Hollywood people on the phone, huge people, and they're just scared to go public, but if a bunch would go public together, they can't blackball them all.
[01:46:20.595 --> 01:46:22.356]  Yeah, the only thing to fear is fear itself.
[01:46:22.437 --> 01:46:26.600]  I mean, if we all come out at once, they can't do nothing to stop us, and that's something we have to do.
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:27.621]  We're all coming out.
[01:46:27.661 --> 01:46:29.502]  I mean, the family members have come out first.
[01:46:29.782 --> 01:46:31.444]  The rescue workers have come out second.
[01:46:31.724 --> 01:46:38.850]  It's time for the American people and also the celebrities to come out, and to stand behind truth and justice, and really fight for what's right.
[01:46:40.471 --> 01:46:41.692]  Now, the cat's out of the bag.
[01:46:41.712 --> 01:46:47.557]  Warren Guerrillo talked about it, but if Mr. 007 goes public, that'll really be something.
[01:46:48.504 --> 01:46:49.565]  It will be something.
[01:46:49.685 --> 01:46:51.385]  And again, it's an amazing time to be alive.
[01:46:51.405 --> 01:46:54.086]  We really don't know what could happen the next day.
[01:46:54.407 --> 01:46:59.329]  And it's just beautiful seeing, you know, getting a phone call from New York Change LA telling me that they just got these celebrities.
[01:46:59.829 --> 01:47:01.530]  And it's beautiful because people know.
[01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:05.271]  And it's just for more people to wake up so we can really do something about it.
[01:47:06.672 --> 01:47:07.432]  It's amazing.
[01:47:07.552 --> 01:47:09.353]  Luke, any other comments or anything you want to say?
[01:47:10.414 --> 01:47:10.834]  No, man.
[01:47:10.914 --> 01:47:14.515]  Alex, just keep up the great job and just people, you know, be the change they want to see in this world.
[01:47:14.816 --> 01:47:17.937]  Get a camera and take this country back one YouTube video at a time.
[01:47:19.730 --> 01:47:20.570]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:47:20.670 --> 01:47:21.371]  I can't help it.
[01:47:21.511 --> 01:47:23.072]  I haven't been this excited in a long time.
[01:47:23.092 --> 01:47:24.572]  I am crazed right now.
[01:47:25.673 --> 01:47:28.714]  It's a beautiful time to be alive.
[01:47:28.774 --> 01:47:29.875]  I mean, I feel great, Alex.
[01:47:29.895 --> 01:47:32.516]  I don't know about you, but it's a good fight to be in.
[01:47:32.896 --> 01:47:40.120]  And I just want to encourage all the people to take charge, stand up, stop watching on the sidelines, take part, and let's take back this country from the New World Order.
[01:47:42.121 --> 01:47:44.382]  Anything new coming out of We Are Change New York?
[01:47:45.455 --> 01:47:49.839]  There's some presidential debates coming up that we are changing and reporters will be attending soon.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:53.603]  I'm not going to name them right now, but you're going to see a lot of great stuff from us.
[01:47:53.963 --> 01:47:58.647]  We also got Kofi Annan in the last couple of days about the child slavery in Africa.
[01:47:58.748 --> 01:47:59.428]  He ignored us.
[01:47:59.468 --> 01:48:00.509]  He blatantly ignored us.
[01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:01.390]  Yeah, this is huge.
[01:48:01.810 --> 01:48:04.453]  We're working on the DVD, on the video right now.
[01:48:04.513 --> 01:48:05.514]  It should be coming out soon.
[01:48:05.794 --> 01:48:06.455]  We're working hard.
[01:48:06.475 --> 01:48:07.256]  We're never going to stop.
[01:48:07.556 --> 01:48:10.739]  Start a change chapter in your city, town, and just be the change you want to see in this world.
[01:48:12.210 --> 01:48:14.232]  Luke Rodowski at WeAreChange.org.
[01:48:14.452 --> 01:48:15.833]  I know you talk about this one down here.
[01:48:15.853 --> 01:48:18.194]  You don't like to toot your own horn, but you're not tooting your horn.
[01:48:18.575 --> 01:48:21.737]  You are an example, a model for others.
[01:48:22.137 --> 01:48:27.581]  Briefly, before I let you go and go to other callers, tell people how you woke up.
[01:48:27.661 --> 01:48:31.384]  Tell them what you were able to do in the last year with WeAreChange.
[01:48:32.150 --> 01:48:35.252]  Well, just briefly, I got beat up by the cops about four or five years ago.
[01:48:35.552 --> 01:48:38.013]  And that woke me up to the whole situation we live in in America.
[01:48:38.313 --> 01:48:39.734]  And that, of course, led me to you.
[01:48:40.094 --> 01:48:42.975]  And seeing your movies, seeing your documentaries just woke me up.
[01:48:43.076 --> 01:48:45.277]  And knowing the misinformation, it made me want to act.
[01:48:45.657 --> 01:48:48.398]  And acting, we started a youth group last year ago.
[01:48:48.618 --> 01:48:50.519]  This is actually the anniversary last year ago.
[01:48:50.839 --> 01:48:51.840]  And we built this up.
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:54.161]  And it was just... This is the anniversary?
[01:48:55.202 --> 01:48:55.722]  I think it is.
[01:48:55.762 --> 01:48:56.182]  Yes, it is.
[01:48:56.922 --> 01:48:58.783]  Today is the anniversary?
[01:48:59.984 --> 01:49:01.865]  Of We Are Change coming together?
[01:49:02.501 --> 01:49:09.225]  And, uh, it's just a beautiful thing seeing it grow and seeing other people taking responsibility upon themselves and doing something right.
[01:49:09.565 --> 01:49:14.267]  Another thing I wanted to bring up is there's this, uh, first responder in New Jersey who just lost his house.
[01:49:14.887 --> 01:49:17.489]  And, uh, people need to bring attention to this guy, Charles Giles.
[01:49:17.809 --> 01:49:18.409]  He needs help.
[01:49:18.469 --> 01:49:19.129]  He needs support.
[01:49:19.170 --> 01:49:19.710]  Help him out.
[01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:20.730]  Go on weirdchange.org.
[01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:21.891]  You get the information at the bottom.
[01:49:21.911 --> 01:49:22.831]  It's the first thing I'll find.
[01:49:23.051 --> 01:49:23.812]  What's his name again?
[01:49:23.832 --> 01:49:24.552]  Your phone cracked.
[01:49:25.273 --> 01:49:26.013]  Charles Giles.
[01:49:26.073 --> 01:49:26.933]  I believe that's his name.
[01:49:27.134 --> 01:49:27.934]  Charles Giles?
[01:49:28.737 --> 01:49:32.238]  Yes, he's losing his house in New Jersey and it's up for the people to stand up with him.
[01:49:32.298 --> 01:49:34.158]  Stand up for this true American hero.
[01:49:34.318 --> 01:49:40.660]  Yeah, the first responders who are sick and dying do not need their houses taken because they're unable to work.
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:42.640]  Yeah, they're foreclosing on their house.
[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:44.220]  This guy can't pay for his medical bills.
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:45.981]  I mean, this guy truly is a hero.
[01:49:46.181 --> 01:49:51.242]  And you guys did raise over $11,000 that we gave to the Feel Good Foundation directly to first responders.
[01:49:51.983 --> 01:49:58.348]  Yeah, then we gave another thousand to Charles a couple days ago, and we helped him out a lot in this situation because he has a whole family to feed.
[01:49:58.388 --> 01:49:59.729]  He has to put food on his table.
[01:50:00.130 --> 01:50:04.053]  And the government basically has unlimited money, but nothing for the firemen and police.
[01:50:04.653 --> 01:50:05.574]  Just unbelievable.
[01:50:06.315 --> 01:50:12.780]  And millions, billions, trillions of money on war, but can't help our own heroes, the 9-11 heroes who went and helped.
[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:14.381]  I mean, this guy, do you hear this?
[01:50:14.561 --> 01:50:17.043]  Charles, this guy, he got his, he hurt his eye.
[01:50:17.103 --> 01:50:17.864]  I mean, he was burnt.
[01:50:18.584 --> 01:50:20.505]  Uh, he worked in there and he still came back.
[01:50:20.545 --> 01:50:22.746]  He was working on the pile till December, injured.
[01:50:23.106 --> 01:50:24.627]  Helping out, trying to find his brothers.
[01:50:24.907 --> 01:50:26.568]  And now the government has forgotten about him.
[01:50:26.608 --> 01:50:27.968]  Now he can't pay his medical bills.
[01:50:28.268 --> 01:50:29.129]  He's losing his house.
[01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:30.349]  He can't put food on the table.
[01:50:30.589 --> 01:50:33.591]  And it's up to the American people to come and help these people out.
[01:50:33.611 --> 01:50:34.751]  We Are Change has been doing it.
[01:50:34.871 --> 01:50:40.794]  And it's up to other groups, other organizations who have the tools, who have the money, who have the resources to help these guys out because nobody else is.
[01:50:41.074 --> 01:50:43.415]  And it's up to the people to help ourselves out.
[01:50:44.964 --> 01:50:48.025]  Luke Rodowski, WeAreChange.org, I salute you.
[01:50:48.045 --> 01:50:50.046]  We'll come right back and take calls.
[01:50:50.446 --> 01:50:54.288]  Riding shotgun with us is the man who interviewed Martin Sheen Saturday.
[01:50:54.308 --> 01:50:56.569]  More of that audio coming up as well.
[01:50:56.989 --> 01:50:58.330]  Stuart Howe on the other side.
[01:51:01.751 --> 01:51:03.152]  It is a big idea.
[01:51:03.172 --> 01:51:05.273]  A new world order.
[01:51:05.993 --> 01:51:10.195]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our government.
[01:51:10.879 --> 01:51:12.600]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:15.942]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[01:51:16.502 --> 01:51:18.924]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:51:19.684 --> 01:51:27.029]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:51:30.023 --> 01:51:35.006]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:51:35.487 --> 01:51:39.089]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:51:39.329 --> 01:51:41.831]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[01:51:41.891 --> 01:51:43.052]  Most people have no idea.
[01:51:43.072 --> 01:51:43.812]  They're not after money.
[01:51:43.832 --> 01:51:44.913]  They have all the money they need.
[01:51:45.133 --> 01:51:45.874]  They're after power.
[01:51:46.114 --> 01:51:46.894]  That's what they're after.
[01:51:47.275 --> 01:51:51.818]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:51:52.018 --> 01:51:55.460]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:58.462]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:51:58.782 --> 01:51:59.823]  You have been warned.
[01:52:01.845 --> 01:52:10.932]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:52:11.173 --> 01:52:22.422]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:52:22.743 --> 01:52:27.767]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[01:52:27.807 --> 01:52:27.947]  I think?
[01:52:46.581 --> 01:52:48.423]  Now let's get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:52:48.483 --> 01:52:49.324]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:52:49.364 --> 01:52:51.927]  That's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:52:51.987 --> 01:52:54.891]  Each night when you sleep, your body uses the time to restore itself.
[01:53:06.912 --> 01:53:08.653]  So that you could wake up feeling renewed.
[01:53:09.173 --> 01:53:11.555]  But wouldn't it be nice to also wake up looking younger?

[01:54:02.085 --> 01:54:05.326]  In constant sorrow, his days are unhandling.
[01:54:29.207 --> 01:54:32.972]  I've seen trouble all my day.
[01:54:38.564 --> 01:54:49.032]  Alright, we have the cleaner audio from Saturday with Martin Sheen, father of Charlie Sheen, questioning the official 9-11 story.
[01:54:49.072 --> 01:54:53.736]  We have it, we're going to be airing it when we start the next hour with a little introduction from myself and Adam.
[01:54:54.256 --> 01:54:59.961]  Adam, first off, does this have the interview as well with Mark Ruffalo?
[01:55:01.902 --> 01:55:02.943]  I won't do yet, Alex.
[01:55:03.704 --> 01:55:03.964]  Pardon me?
[01:55:04.676 --> 01:55:05.736]  That's not on there yet.
[01:55:05.816 --> 01:55:09.357]  We can get that audio ripped for you, but it's going to take a little bit of time.
[01:55:09.397 --> 01:55:09.838]  You're the man.
[01:55:09.858 --> 01:55:12.638]  Can you stand by and be doing that so we can have that before the show ends?
[01:55:14.859 --> 01:55:15.119]  Sure.
[01:55:15.359 --> 01:55:15.979]  Yeah, I'll do that.
[01:55:16.179 --> 01:55:17.860]  You are awesome.
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:20.301]  You guys are really taking action.
[01:55:20.561 --> 01:55:25.662]  WeAreChange.LA.org or WeAreChangeLA.org.
[01:55:25.742 --> 01:55:27.363]  Links up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:55:28.786 --> 01:55:31.908]  In the story, big news here, big censorship by Digg.
[01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:36.351]  355 Diggs, 100 gets it on the main page, in one hour and nine minutes.
[01:55:36.451 --> 01:55:38.193]  Unprecedented, and they have buried it.
[01:55:38.813 --> 01:55:41.255]  Only hundreds more Diggs can drive it past them.
[01:55:41.275 --> 01:55:43.256]  We need a Digg revolt.
[01:55:43.617 --> 01:55:46.859]  This has happened before when they censored things by other news sites.
[01:55:47.179 --> 01:55:50.101]  This is outrageous that they would say that this isn't newsworthy.
[01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:58.147]  Even if they don't agree with what Martin Sheen has said, the fact that all these guys who admit they're CENTCOM and in the military and are still pro-war, that small minority,
[01:55:58.707 --> 01:56:02.428]  Our in there trying to censor PrisonPlanet.com is disgusting, is it not?
[01:56:04.608 --> 01:56:04.888]  Yeah.
[01:56:05.569 --> 01:56:06.249]  It is feasible.
[01:56:07.249 --> 01:56:10.050]  It's absolutely, absolutely incredible.
[01:56:10.070 --> 01:56:13.510]  When we come back, uh, well this is about a two minute clip, isn't it, Adam?
[01:56:14.631 --> 01:56:15.791]  Uh, yeah, that's about right.
[01:56:15.811 --> 01:56:17.231]  It might be a little bit less.
[01:56:18.492 --> 01:56:19.832]  Okay, that's been... A little bit less than two minutes.
[01:56:21.152 --> 01:56:24.573]  John just popped in my head, popped in my ear and told me, uh, how long is it, John?
[01:56:26.508 --> 01:56:27.369]  Three minutes, actually.
[01:56:27.989 --> 01:56:35.634]  So, we're going to come back, I'm going to introduce the clip, and then, Adam, I know you're busy, but I'd like you to ride shotgun with us, but I know I'm asking you now to upload more.
[01:56:36.455 --> 01:56:40.597]  So, do you want to go do that, or can you do that while you're interviewed?
[01:56:40.617 --> 01:56:43.299]  I can talk with you, Alex.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:50.344]  Drew, our tech wizard here, is getting the audio for the Mark Ruffalo interview.
[01:56:50.444 --> 01:56:51.044]  Unbelievable.
[01:56:51.144 --> 01:56:52.505]  Fantastic, fantastic.
[01:56:52.545 --> 01:56:53.386]  Well, again, I mean,
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:55.740]  This is exciting.
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:59.163]  All I can say is this is really causing a domino effect or a snowball.
[01:56:59.583 --> 01:57:00.244]  What do you say to that?
[01:57:00.264 --> 01:57:03.386]  Oh, that's outstanding, Alex.
[01:57:03.446 --> 01:57:04.807]  That's exactly what we want.
[01:57:04.827 --> 01:57:11.512]  We want to open up the floodgates, you know, get as many people as possible out there talking about the truth of 9-11.
[01:57:12.393 --> 01:57:17.316]  And, you know, that's the strength of the enemy, Alex's secrecy.
[01:57:18.177 --> 01:57:20.639]  And we're taking that away from them.
[01:57:21.661 --> 01:57:33.452]  Well, to have Mark Ruffalo speak out, to have Martin Sheehan at the same time do it, to have George Carlin say, oh yeah, you know, he doesn't ever buy the official thing and that there's a cover-up and that they had a new investigation, it'd be a cover-up.
[01:57:33.853 --> 01:57:38.397]  I mean, that is three mega-missiles in the info war right at the enemy's heart.
[01:57:39.318 --> 01:57:39.879]  Exactly.
[01:57:40.239 --> 01:57:42.181]  Luke Rodowky, how excited are you right now?
[01:57:43.146 --> 01:57:46.168]  It's a beautiful time to be alive, and it's just amazing, you know?
[01:57:46.288 --> 01:57:51.772]  It's Rose O'Donnell, Charlie Sheen, I mean, these three new people who came out today, I mean, this is going to drive it into the mainstream.
[01:57:52.033 --> 01:57:53.914]  They can't stop us, they can't censor us.
[01:57:53.954 --> 01:58:00.579]  We're going to do whatever we have to do, and that's taking it to the streets, that's taking it to Bill Maher, taking it to Bill Clinton.
[01:58:00.599 --> 01:58:10.426]  It doesn't matter whatever happens, we're going to take it, and we're going to win this fight, because we're going to do it for the right reasons, and we're going to bring justice to the family members, and we're going to get the proper help for the first responders, and that's what it's about.
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:12.681]  Absolutely.
[01:58:12.721 --> 01:58:14.422]  We're going to break for 70 seconds.
[01:58:14.462 --> 01:58:17.544]  We're going to come back and we're going to start the second hour.
[01:58:18.385 --> 01:58:23.248]  Riding shotgun right now is the gentleman who interviewed Mark Ruffalo.
[01:58:23.468 --> 01:58:28.071]  We also have Stewart on, Stewart Howell, who interviewed Martin Sheen.
[01:58:28.972 --> 01:58:33.735]  We are Change New York, who did the interview, the quick interview with George Carlin.
[01:58:34.416 --> 01:58:37.598]  All of them, info warriors of the highest degree.
[01:58:37.958 --> 01:58:38.679]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:40.999 --> 01:58:45.583]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:58:57.521 --> 01:59:01.702]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:59:02.342 --> 01:59:03.182]  You want answers?
[01:59:03.942 --> 01:59:04.843]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:04.863 --> 01:59:09.424]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:09.684 --> 01:59:13.805]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:59:14.305 --> 01:59:16.345]  We are now into the third and final hour.
[01:59:17.505 --> 01:59:19.226]  We are ChangeLA.org.
[01:59:19.266 --> 01:59:20.306]  Interviewed Martin Sheen.
[01:59:21.286 --> 01:59:25.087]  Another huge actor, Mark Ruffalo, at the same time about 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:59:25.488 --> 01:59:31.970]  They both said that they questioned the official story, brought up Building 7, Tower 1 and 2, NORAD stand down, Blackwater, the police state, all of it.
[01:59:33.590 --> 01:59:36.912]  Both clips from the Ruffalo and the Sheen are coming up later.
[01:59:36.992 --> 01:59:42.714]  The reason, we already aired one earlier audio, you know, off the television set playing the tape.
[01:59:43.334 --> 01:59:48.796]  But there's so much noise that it's hard to make it out, but you can hear it, we got quotes from it.
[01:59:49.665 --> 01:59:53.067]  They compressed it down to like two... What did they compress it to?
[01:59:54.468 --> 01:59:55.208]  Two megabytes.
[01:59:55.468 --> 01:59:56.909]  So it's got the compression sound on it.
[01:59:56.929 --> 02:00:03.092]  We're going to recompress it, get it back into the network, and by 20 after, we're going to have this for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:03.512 --> 02:00:06.374]  But again, this is fighters in the field doing an excellent job.
[02:00:06.394 --> 02:00:06.954]  That's coming up.
[02:00:07.294 --> 02:00:08.875]  Luke Rodowski, you've got the floor.
[02:00:09.215 --> 02:00:11.016]  Talk about what 9-11 Crew is doing right now.
[02:00:11.076 --> 02:00:12.937]  Talk about how people need to get involved.
[02:00:12.977 --> 02:00:14.498]  Talk about how serious this is.
[02:00:15.518 --> 02:00:17.740]  I mean, I mean, this is the perfect time to be alive.
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:19.661]  I mean, it's not time to watch.
[02:00:19.701 --> 02:00:21.002]  It's not time to listen.
[02:00:21.062 --> 02:00:22.083]  It's time to act.
[02:00:22.243 --> 02:00:23.324]  It's time to do something.
[02:00:23.624 --> 02:00:25.146]  And this is the perfect time to be alive.
[02:00:25.386 --> 02:00:26.126]  We have the internet.
[02:00:26.327 --> 02:00:27.548]  We have all our technology.
[02:00:27.808 --> 02:00:35.714]  We have the time, the perfect time right now to actually do something and actually do something positive and take this country back away from the criminals who stole it away from us.
[02:00:36.061 --> 02:00:37.842]  And make this country mean what it meant before.
[02:00:38.162 --> 02:00:40.023]  And that's the Bill of Rights, that's the Constitution.
[02:00:40.323 --> 02:00:42.424]  Let's take what's ours, let's take what's right.
[02:00:42.764 --> 02:00:47.087]  And again, stop listening, stop watching, let's start acting, let's start doing something.
[02:00:49.488 --> 02:00:59.633]  What do you think of the censorship of Digg right now blocking the Martin Sheen Questions official 9-11 story from PrisonPlanet.com with 550 plus Diggs and they're blocking it?
[02:01:00.413 --> 02:01:03.595]  I think it's extremely smart what they're doing because they can't outright
[02:01:03.971 --> 02:01:04.492]  I don't think so.
[02:01:16.129 --> 02:01:19.230]  More, if it gets on the front page of VIG, thousands of more people will see it.
[02:01:19.511 --> 02:01:20.631]  I mean, we have the truth.
[02:01:20.671 --> 02:01:23.232]  We are doing the job that the mainstream media is not doing.
[02:01:23.512 --> 02:01:26.734]  And the only way they can censor us is by censoring our YouTube video history.
[02:01:26.774 --> 02:01:31.776]  Well, if you go to YouTube or Google, they'll have stuff they put on their front page to make you watch it.
[02:01:31.816 --> 02:01:35.518]  Some girl acting stupid, some guy acting stupid when it has a thousand views.
[02:01:35.838 --> 02:01:38.759]  We'll have something with 300,000 views, 5 million views.
[02:01:39.019 --> 02:01:40.240]  They never put it on the main page.
[02:01:40.973 --> 02:01:43.315]  Yeah, they always have mindless fluff on the front page.
[02:01:43.335 --> 02:01:47.298]  They have some girl dancing, or something stupid, or some guy putting Mentos in a Coke bottle.
[02:01:47.538 --> 02:01:48.939]  But that's not what, you know, it's about.
[02:01:48.999 --> 02:01:51.921]  I mean, you really see these new videos on YouTube.
[02:01:51.941 --> 02:01:55.904]  Thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, see them, and they get inspired.
[02:01:56.184 --> 02:02:00.708]  And we do the job, the mainstream media job, that the mainstream media is not doing.
[02:02:00.968 --> 02:02:06.052]  And we should be complimented for that, not censored by YouTube, by Google Video, by Pig.
[02:02:06.092 --> 02:02:10.375]  And it's up to us to kind of make people aware of that, that they're doing it.
[02:02:10.828 --> 02:02:12.709]  And spread it out to as many outlets as we can.
[02:02:12.749 --> 02:02:14.531]  Maybe not YouTube, maybe other video formats.
[02:02:14.831 --> 02:02:16.232]  This has got to be a record.
[02:02:16.252 --> 02:02:16.912]  450 plus digs.
[02:02:16.932 --> 02:02:19.174]  100 puts it on the main page.
[02:02:19.634 --> 02:02:21.816]  In an hour and 21 minutes and they censored it.
[02:02:23.017 --> 02:02:25.799]  Exactly, and that's why it's important to put more digs in there.
[02:02:25.859 --> 02:02:26.819]  Send it out to everybody.
[02:02:26.839 --> 02:02:28.420]  Send it on your MySpace bulletin.
[02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:29.881]  Send it out to your friends in email.
[02:02:29.901 --> 02:02:30.842]  Send it out to your school.
[02:02:31.202 --> 02:02:34.525]  Tell everybody about it, because they can't... I mean, make this blatant.
[02:02:34.605 --> 02:02:36.066]  Like, let's get a thousand digs.
[02:02:36.546 --> 02:02:37.727]  I mean, tell everybody.
[02:02:38.405 --> 02:02:40.006]  You know, this is the time we act.
[02:02:40.186 --> 02:02:40.986]  Let's stop watching.
[02:02:41.006 --> 02:02:41.887]  Let's stop participating.
[02:02:41.927 --> 02:02:43.067]  Let's take this country back.
[02:02:44.508 --> 02:03:05.877]  Well, I saw a post on Dig a few weeks ago and the guy was very eloquent describing how all these wannabe fascists and all these neocons that defend Bush and the open borders and everything else and the war, when the music stops and there's five chairs and a thousand of them in brown shirts dancing around, they're gonna just try to creep off and act like they were never for all this.
[02:03:07.463 --> 02:03:09.763]  I mean, but it's clearly blatant what's going on.
[02:03:09.824 --> 02:03:12.844]  I mean, it's clearly blatant.
[02:03:12.864 --> 02:03:23.646]  I mean, it's just crazy having family members, having rescue workers stand beside us, and having the mainstream media still call us conspiracy theorists, right-wing, crazy conspiracy theorists.
[02:03:23.906 --> 02:03:24.346]  It's not.
[02:03:24.587 --> 02:03:25.427]  It's really true.
[02:03:25.807 --> 02:03:27.967]  And people have to understand that.
[02:03:28.027 --> 02:03:29.087]  Well, take Bill Doyle.
[02:03:29.448 --> 02:03:34.389]  Take Bill Doyle, the head of the biggest victims group, 7,000 plus members, been all over television.
[02:03:35.509 --> 02:03:36.549]  Lost his son Joey.
[02:03:37.848 --> 02:03:42.251]  And he comes on here over a year ago and says more than half their members believe inside job and he does.
[02:03:42.712 --> 02:03:44.273]  The media totally ignores that!
[02:03:44.473 --> 02:03:46.575]  And then claims the family don't like us.
[02:03:46.615 --> 02:03:47.535]  No, they love us!
[02:03:48.156 --> 02:03:48.856]  You murderers!
[02:03:49.337 --> 02:03:52.099]  We'll be right back.
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:55.041]  It is a big idea.
[02:03:56.101 --> 02:03:57.142]  A new world order.
[02:03:57.863 --> 02:04:01.966]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:04:02.006 --> 02:04:04.508]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:04:05.455 --> 02:04:07.797]  Isn't their objective being world domination?
[02:04:08.357 --> 02:04:10.799]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:18.926]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:04:21.889 --> 02:04:26.853]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[02:07:21.851 --> 02:07:24.554]  Luke Rudowsky, the founder of We Are Change, joins us.
[02:07:25.895 --> 02:07:30.440]  The man that you've seen in the responses to Bill Maher, those well-done videos that have been put together.
[02:07:32.122 --> 02:07:33.083]  Stuart Howell's on with us.
[02:07:33.103 --> 02:07:34.704]  He just interviewed Martin Sheen Saturday.
[02:07:34.724 --> 02:07:39.009]  They also got an interview with Mark Ruffalo, one of the other We Are Changers from L.A.
[02:07:41.522 --> 02:07:47.605]  The websites are WeAreChangeLA.org, WeAreChange.org, of course there's a mother ship in New York, chapters all over the country.

[02:08:21.536 --> 02:08:23.217]  My shipping guys are on it.
[02:08:23.877 --> 02:08:24.938]  And I just salute them.
[02:08:26.099 --> 02:08:31.402]  Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, available on DVD, 2 hours, 20 minutes, and then 40 minutes of extras.
[02:08:31.882 --> 02:08:35.645]  The battle for the Republic shows the illegal alien invasion, how that's all organized and orchestrated.
[02:08:36.292 --> 02:08:38.173]  Not even against the illegals, I'm just showing what they're doing.
[02:08:38.693 --> 02:08:53.198]  And then another 10 or so minutes from Istanbul that we couldn't put in the film, the Bilderberg Group meeting, and then my good friend Jimmy Vaughn, blues legend, plays No Shackles on me at the Texas Independence Day Rally.
[02:08:54.078 --> 02:08:54.559]  Amazing.
[02:08:54.719 --> 02:08:58.540]  So again, in-game blueprint for global enslavement, the must-see film,
[02:08:59.458 --> 02:09:02.240]  Massive buzz on it out there as people get a chance to see it.
[02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:18.009]  The reviews are even better than I thought they would be, because frankly, you watch something a hundred times while you're making it, you get nauseated when you see it after literally hundreds of times I've seen all the footage, and then dozens of times once it was done just watching and studying it and making final edits, and I couldn't really gauge.
[02:09:18.029 --> 02:09:20.231]  I knew it was good information, powerful, but long.
[02:09:20.551 --> 02:09:21.832]  People are just going crazy.
[02:09:22.072 --> 02:09:23.893]  Go read the reviews at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:23.913 --> 02:09:28.736]  We have sources where we got the reviews, what magazines said, what websites said, what posts said.
[02:09:29.415 --> 02:09:32.556]  I mean, just amazing the reviews that Endgame Blueprint for Global has displayed.
[02:09:32.856 --> 02:09:37.558]  Luke, a plug for Endgame here because it did just officially launch for DVD sale shipping today.
[02:09:39.138 --> 02:09:40.599]  You saw it in New York at the premiere.
[02:09:41.459 --> 02:09:46.801]  I put it up there for free so we could give the proceeds to first responders, but you saw it in New York.
[02:09:46.841 --> 02:09:47.701]  What did you think of Endgame?
[02:09:48.624 --> 02:09:50.465]  I mean, it's an amazing documentary.
[02:09:50.985 --> 02:09:57.869]  All Americans have to see this documentary because it breaks down the false left-right paradigm and makes people understand, stop looking left, stop looking right.
[02:09:58.089 --> 02:09:59.769]  Let's look up top.
[02:09:59.809 --> 02:10:00.390]  Let's look up.
[02:10:00.490 --> 02:10:04.132]  Let's see the real people behind the crimes that are being committed right here in America.
[02:10:04.392 --> 02:10:05.532]  And it's a beautiful documentary.
[02:10:05.552 --> 02:10:06.953]  I think it's one of your best works ever.
[02:10:07.353 --> 02:10:07.794]  I think so.
[02:10:23.445 --> 02:10:24.406]  We're good to go.
[02:10:45.619 --> 02:10:47.940]  And there have been a lot better, quote, elites.
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:49.960]  We need a free market justice system.
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:57.402]  I don't care if they're powerful people, but they shouldn't collude together to rob and steal our land, to dumb us down, to inject us with poison, to spray stuff on us.
[02:10:58.042 --> 02:11:01.163]  It's got to stop, and we've got to defeat this New World Order.
[02:11:02.424 --> 02:11:04.864]  I'm about to go right back to calls and try to shotgun through them quickly.
[02:11:05.184 --> 02:11:07.345]  Stuart, any caveats you want to add before we go to calls?
[02:11:07.961 --> 02:11:09.922]  Yeah, I just want to reinforce what you had just said.
[02:11:09.962 --> 02:11:16.727]  We've got to, you know, restore some integrity and support people that are bringing integrity back into the upper realms of the pyramid.
[02:11:16.947 --> 02:11:20.389]  And, you know, I'd like to support what you guys said earlier.
[02:11:20.409 --> 02:11:31.816]  You know, when you do make a change, you get off the bench and you see people doing things that you like and you're proud of, and you get out there and you become a participant, the feeling is so amazingly marvelous to be part of that.
[02:11:31.916 --> 02:11:35.679]  And I just would like to encourage everybody to feel the wonderful solidarity that I felt.
[02:11:36.349 --> 02:11:36.889]  Absolutely.
[02:11:36.929 --> 02:11:38.090]  Let me just put you both on hold.
[02:11:38.110 --> 02:11:39.391]  I want to spend two minutes on this.
[02:11:39.511 --> 02:11:42.572]  I promised I'd do it today, and then I forgot, and it's important.
[02:11:42.592 --> 02:11:44.193]  Then we're going to go to your calls.
[02:11:44.233 --> 02:11:49.776]  I promise to Anthony, Sean, Brian, John, and everybody else that's holding.
[02:11:52.997 --> 02:11:54.618]  Last night, I started getting phone calls.
[02:11:55.759 --> 02:11:59.241]  And that was about when I turned my cell phone off and quit answering the phone.
[02:12:00.661 --> 02:12:01.722]  Going, have you seen this?
[02:12:02.910 --> 02:12:05.871]  They're alleging all this evil campaign behavior by you.
[02:12:06.051 --> 02:12:06.731]  And I said, what?
[02:12:07.531 --> 02:12:13.113]  So I went to Hot Air, Michelle Malkin, Fox News website, and she works for Fox News.
[02:12:13.673 --> 02:12:25.156]  She's the lady that writes books, The Case for Internment Camps, about how camps are wonderful in America, and let's put people in them, and I've had her on, a real monster, and total fake conservative Judas Goat.
[02:12:26.096 --> 02:12:27.916]  And I first read it, and I thought, this is ridiculous!
[02:12:27.956 --> 02:12:29.897]  They're saying Ron Paul paid me money!
[02:12:31.826 --> 02:12:33.147]  And I was going, what is this?
[02:12:34.788 --> 02:12:39.271]  And I thought, there must be another Alex Jones, because there are, there must be a thousand Alex Joneses.
[02:12:39.891 --> 02:12:41.992]  And I get accused for everything they do or don't do.
[02:12:42.052 --> 02:12:43.173]  I'm a New York Times writer.
[02:12:43.213 --> 02:12:44.234]  I work for NPR.
[02:12:44.294 --> 02:12:46.915]  I'm a billionaire in Canada.
[02:12:47.175 --> 02:12:49.457]  I am a Scientologist, because there's all these Alex Joneses.
[02:12:49.497 --> 02:12:49.897]  Name that.
[02:12:50.277 --> 02:12:51.558]  So at first, I went, wait a minute.
[02:12:51.578 --> 02:12:52.458]  I saw the number.
[02:12:52.478 --> 02:12:53.199]  I went, wait a minute.
[02:12:55.700 --> 02:12:56.381]  I had already given
[02:12:58.007 --> 02:13:07.471]  I guess my wife had already given some money to, through me, to, you know, it's a family, but she'd given money to Ron Paul months and months and months ago when I said I'd do it on air.
[02:13:08.352 --> 02:13:09.913]  And then I said, you know, I'm going to give more money.
[02:13:09.973 --> 02:13:16.476]  And I said to her, I said, go give him, I think the maximum we can give now is a thousand or so apiece.
[02:13:18.436 --> 02:13:19.617]  And my wife's smart and informed.
[02:13:19.637 --> 02:13:20.878]  She doesn't know about all the election laws.
[02:13:20.918 --> 02:13:22.518]  I try to know about them and they're so complex.
[02:13:22.538 --> 02:13:22.999]  I know 2300 is the maximum.
[02:13:24.961 --> 02:13:26.022]  And I guess she'd read that.
[02:13:26.042 --> 02:13:27.482]  And I walked in and it said $2,300.
[02:13:27.562 --> 02:13:28.683]  And I said, no, no, no.
[02:13:29.323 --> 02:13:31.084]  I said, I think you've already given money, honey.
[02:13:31.984 --> 02:13:33.665]  They're going to have to give that back to you.
[02:13:35.946 --> 02:13:37.747]  Tell PayPal to dispute it and only give them $1,000.
[02:13:37.787 --> 02:13:40.008]  And she goes, OK.
[02:13:40.048 --> 02:13:42.869]  And she goes into PayPal and tells them, oh, that was a mistake.
[02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:45.651]  And so then a couple of days later, it went into our account.
[02:13:47.872 --> 02:13:50.413]  Because it had already gone to the Paul camp, they had to fill out a form.
[02:13:50.713 --> 02:13:53.034]  And right there in the Federal Elections Commission,
[02:13:55.618 --> 02:14:02.679]  FEC, it says, this is all public, that radio broadcaster Alex Jones gave $2,300.
[02:14:02.719 --> 02:14:16.242]  Then it says a few days later, because they had to go manually do it, and it hassled the Paul campaign, because we made a mistake, and they had to give the $1,300 back, because I'm not going to violate election laws.
[02:14:17.722 --> 02:14:18.803]  And so that happened.
[02:14:18.843 --> 02:14:20.663]  We put the PayPal request in, that's on record.
[02:14:20.903 --> 02:14:25.244]  Now the Federal Election Commission documents say it was a refund.
[02:14:26.807 --> 02:14:31.328]  They didn't care on Hot Air and the Liberty Papers and all these places.
[02:14:31.888 --> 02:14:32.568]  They knew that.
[02:14:32.628 --> 02:14:39.110]  People started posting immediately on the sites going, well, hey, wait a minute, it says it was a refund, then they spent it.
[02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:43.071]  Ron Paul's embarrassed at his scum and he gave the money back, but why only half?
[02:14:44.811 --> 02:14:45.812]  See how they work, folks?
[02:14:45.832 --> 02:14:50.453]  I mean, when I get on air and I say, I'm sending a thousand bucks to Ron Paul the times I've done it, I do it.
[02:14:51.093 --> 02:14:51.853]  That wasn't talk.
[02:14:53.402 --> 02:14:54.303]  And again, my fault.
[02:14:54.443 --> 02:14:54.883]  I'm hurried.
[02:14:54.944 --> 02:14:55.324]  I'm busy.
[02:14:55.424 --> 02:14:56.705]  One night I go, Oh, I keep forgetting.
[02:14:56.745 --> 02:14:57.866]  I said, I'm giving a thousand more.
[02:14:58.166 --> 02:15:00.228]  You give a thousand, honey, and I'll give a thousand.
[02:15:01.950 --> 02:15:06.254]  And then she just combined it in my PayPal account and gave the maximum.
[02:15:06.274 --> 02:15:07.395]  And I said, Oh no, we can't do that.
[02:15:07.675 --> 02:15:08.356]  Take half of it back.
[02:15:08.756 --> 02:15:11.659]  And then, so we email and we contact them.
[02:15:11.699 --> 02:15:13.501]  We tell them, Hey, this isn't us.
[02:15:13.541 --> 02:15:15.082]  And they just laugh back at us, man.
[02:15:16.183 --> 02:15:17.144]  I just, it's so sick.
[02:15:17.913 --> 02:15:23.317]  It's so sick, and so now they're claiming Ron Paul pays me, and this is all evil.
[02:15:23.337 --> 02:15:25.878]  I mean, they don't care if Bush is on the Saudi payroll.
[02:15:25.898 --> 02:15:27.920]  They don't care if Hillary's getting Chai Khan money.
[02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:29.080]  They love it.
[02:15:29.981 --> 02:15:31.382]  It's that I am evil.
[02:15:31.982 --> 02:15:38.947]  And some nice little spin, but we have the PayPal record that we gave it, and then disputed it, and it's all on record right there.
[02:15:39.687 --> 02:15:41.768]  Again, no good deed goes unpunished.
[02:15:42.829 --> 02:15:44.610]  And that's how this system is selectively enforced.
[02:15:44.630 --> 02:15:45.511]  We didn't do anything wrong, but
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:48.442]  If you don't even do anything wrong, they act like it is wrong.
[02:15:49.022 --> 02:15:52.585]  And then, if you are with Chinese generals getting millions of dollars, it's okay.
[02:15:54.607 --> 02:15:57.950]  So, nice try, scum, fake conservatives.
[02:15:58.070 --> 02:15:59.872]  You will be exposed.
[02:16:00.632 --> 02:16:03.354]  That the NRA is pro-gun, supporting a huge gun control bill.
[02:16:04.395 --> 02:16:06.097]  That the Republicans are not conservative.
[02:16:06.917 --> 02:16:08.999]  That they have all these gay porn stars in the White House.
[02:16:09.039 --> 02:16:09.820]  It's all coming out!
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:13.141]  It's all going to come out and you're not going to get away with it.
[02:16:13.201 --> 02:16:17.463]  I'm sorry to digress with the callers and everybody else, but Luke Radowski, you got any comments on those dirty tricks?
[02:16:18.304 --> 02:16:20.525]  I mean, they're looking for any mistakes for us to slip up.
[02:16:20.605 --> 02:16:21.625]  We can't make no mistakes.
[02:16:21.706 --> 02:16:26.748]  I mean, they're going to find whatever they could find, but again, they're just trying to, you know, discredit you, and they can't.
[02:16:26.868 --> 02:16:28.309]  I mean, you didn't do nothing illegal.
[02:16:28.829 --> 02:16:30.230]  And again, just keep moving forward.
[02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:31.471]  Don't let these people stop you.
[02:16:31.511 --> 02:16:32.431]  Just keep moving forward.
[02:16:33.492 --> 02:16:39.615]  But it's the incredible thing that the Federal Election Commission says that it was a refund.
[02:16:40.755 --> 02:16:42.316]  Says that we asked for a refund.
[02:16:43.736 --> 02:16:44.317]  It's blatant.
[02:16:44.337 --> 02:16:47.538]  I mean, they're looking for any little thing, and it's not even true what happened.
[02:16:47.638 --> 02:16:49.319]  And they're just going to try to get you.
[02:16:49.339 --> 02:16:50.440]  They're going to try to call on you.
[02:16:50.480 --> 02:16:51.560]  They're going to try to give you trouble.
[02:16:51.620 --> 02:16:51.920]  I know.
[02:16:52.581 --> 02:16:54.762]  I got Glenn Beck saying I'm dangerous on the radio, man.
[02:16:55.062 --> 02:16:57.963]  It's... I'm just sick of them!
[02:16:59.224 --> 02:17:01.065]  Well, Alex, it's working against them, I think.
[02:17:01.345 --> 02:17:10.329]  You know, it's going to come out that their accusations are groundless, that it's, you know, it's a big hoax, and that we're, you know, we're really peaceful people that are trying to patriotically help our country, and
[02:17:11.042 --> 02:17:12.383]  It makes them look bad and desperate.
[02:17:12.403 --> 02:17:18.905]  Every lie that gets taken down by the truth, they have less to stand on, and they've overplayed their hand, as you pointed out so well.
[02:17:20.766 --> 02:17:23.447]  Well, we're going to come back and take calls, gentlemen, and both of you can stay with us.
[02:17:23.487 --> 02:17:25.227]  I promise I'll get to everybody in rapid succession.
[02:17:25.267 --> 02:17:26.568]  Have your questions or comments ready.
[02:17:26.848 --> 02:17:28.449]  I just... I saw it yesterday.
[02:17:28.489 --> 02:17:34.731]  I wasn't going to respond, and it was all over all these other websites, and then I know that even responding will just make it ten times worse.
[02:17:35.111 --> 02:17:37.632]  It's just... I mean, there's even a website saying I'm a
[02:17:38.607 --> 02:17:47.271]  Reptoid now, and showing my eyes, because I'm looking up at lights, and two lights, you know, two lights, they show up as two white spots on each side of your eye.
[02:17:47.291 --> 02:17:54.635]  And there's some other video where the video blips digitally, like computers do, and they say it's me turning into a Reptoid.
[02:17:54.675 --> 02:17:57.377]  I mean, and then they demand I respond to the Reptoidness.
[02:17:57.437 --> 02:17:59.198]  I mean, I just can't do it anymore, folks.
[02:17:59.518 --> 02:18:00.458]  I'm not a Reptoid.
[02:18:00.478 --> 02:18:01.679]  I'm not a Scientologist.
[02:18:02.059 --> 02:18:03.220]  I'm not an anti-Semite.
[02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:04.680]  I'm not any of these things.
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:05.941]  I'm so sick of it.
[02:18:06.474 --> 02:18:08.095]  But it's not that they're attacking me, guys.
[02:18:08.175 --> 02:18:15.480]  It gets depressing because some, if they're not going telepro, some of these activists are mentally ill, and they can't focus on do real issues.
[02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:19.242]  I just... I mean, even if I am a reptoid, folks, okay?
[02:18:19.262 --> 02:18:19.883]  I admit it, I am.
[02:18:19.903 --> 02:18:20.463]  That's a joke.
[02:18:20.523 --> 02:18:21.864]  Now they're going to cut that out and have me saying it.
[02:18:23.325 --> 02:18:25.666]  Can they please go out and say, please don't take the vaccines?
[02:18:26.347 --> 02:18:28.388]  Can they please go out and expose issues?
[02:18:28.828 --> 02:18:34.412]  I mean, it's just, there's so... There's people... I can't warn everybody about the mercury in the vaccines, but you out there could.
[02:18:34.592 --> 02:18:35.753]  We have the power together.
[02:18:36.909 --> 02:18:38.032]  And, ah, it's just incredible.
[02:18:38.052 --> 02:18:41.581]  I wouldn't even talk about the reptoid thing, but it's just at a certain point.
[02:18:42.503 --> 02:18:43.666]  It's just, it's insane.
[02:18:43.806 --> 02:18:44.528]  It's insane.
[02:18:44.548 --> 02:18:45.631]  We'll be right back.
[02:18:53.197 --> 02:18:55.478]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[02:18:55.858 --> 02:19:05.842]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[02:19:06.342 --> 02:19:11.864]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[02:19:11.924 --> 02:19:18.607]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July, with falls of $32 billion in the last two weeks alone.
[02:19:19.107 --> 02:19:21.108]  Could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[02:19:22.051 --> 02:19:29.178]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency, and the quality of the dollar is poor, because the quantity is so high.
[02:19:29.538 --> 02:19:35.344]  Printing money out of thin air has disastrous results, victimizing middle class citizens and discouraging savings.
[02:19:35.905 --> 02:19:40.389]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[02:19:40.809 --> 02:19:43.372]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[02:19:43.812 --> 02:19:45.433]  Call me, Tom Andrew at 1-800-606-1294.
[02:19:45.493 --> 02:19:45.733]  That's 1-800-606-1294.
[02:19:54.202 --> 02:19:56.643]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:57.284 --> 02:20:05.368]  Did you know that Senate committee investigations in the 1960s called the international communist movement the greatest conspiracy the world has ever witnessed?
[02:20:06.248 --> 02:20:13.572]  They said the communists had infiltrated into high government offices in the State Department and also advisors to presidents.
[02:20:14.429 --> 02:20:22.115]  Did you know that the Communist infiltration successfully stopped all FBI investigations into their secret activities?
[02:20:22.675 --> 02:20:30.501]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[02:20:52.688 --> 02:20:53.148]  Hi, Ken.
[02:20:53.208 --> 02:20:53.969]  It's Judy again.
[02:20:53.989 --> 02:20:58.510]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[02:20:58.670 --> 02:21:01.812]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[02:21:02.032 --> 02:21:03.913]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[02:21:04.193 --> 02:21:06.273]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[02:21:06.454 --> 02:21:12.556]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[02:21:12.756 --> 02:21:18.058]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[02:21:18.318 --> 02:21:21.179]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[02:21:21.300 --> 02:21:22.220]  Go KenSolar!
[02:21:23.527 --> 02:21:25.048]  Get the best of both worlds.

[02:21:36.654 --> 02:21:39.336]  Lower your electric bill and be prepared year-round.

[02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:50.642]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.

[02:22:53.835 --> 02:23:00.421]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:04.011 --> 02:23:05.251]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[02:23:05.311 --> 02:23:05.932]  until 2 p.m.
[02:23:05.992 --> 02:23:07.112]  Central Standard Time.
[02:23:07.132 --> 02:23:10.613]  That's 9 to noon Pacific, noon to 3 Eastern.
[02:23:10.673 --> 02:23:11.893]  We are live.
[02:23:11.913 --> 02:23:19.996]  I'm going to ask Luke Radowsky of We Are Change New York, the founder, and all the folks from We Are Change LA who are on the line with us to hold with us during the next segment.
[02:23:20.796 --> 02:23:24.477]  We are now going to be able to play the clip.
[02:23:26.398 --> 02:23:32.740]  Here is the clip from the anti-war rally that was held Saturday
[02:23:33.470 --> 02:23:41.694]  This is the first time this is being heard with Martin Sheen questioning the official 9-11 story.
[02:23:42.894 --> 02:23:45.396]  And all he is doing is saying what NIST has said.
[02:23:45.416 --> 02:23:49.077]  They're saying they're having to look at bombs in the buildings now, Tower 1, 2, and 7.
[02:23:50.558 --> 02:23:57.041]  And they're saying now they can't explain how fire or the collisions could have done this with any of the three buildings.
[02:23:59.002 --> 02:24:06.624]  In an Angus and Reed poll from earlier last year, 84% of Americans questioned the official story and believe they may be lied to.
[02:24:06.644 --> 02:24:11.485]  68% in Zogby polls believe it could be an inside job or a cover-up.
[02:24:12.025 --> 02:24:21.128]  They keep focusing on Scripps Howard News Service and other polls that show upwards of 37% and 36% in two different polls, saying they believe it's a total inside job.
[02:24:22.508 --> 02:24:26.749]  So, Martin Sheen is just a prominent person who has the courage to speak out.
[02:24:27.587 --> 02:24:29.919]  Here is the audio, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:30.552 --> 02:24:39.319]  I've been involved these days in trying to bring awareness to the 9-11 situation and kind of the option of that being the war and the patriots and what not.
[02:24:39.439 --> 02:24:48.846]  I'm just wondering, you know, what your take was on it and, you know, has anything happened or what we can do to help the situation?
[02:24:48.866 --> 02:24:51.107]  You know, I don't know what to suggest.
[02:24:51.288 --> 02:24:59.253]  You know, when there was a lot of questions about it, my son introduced me to a lot of information.
[02:25:00.514 --> 02:25:05.599]  Until then, which was just like last year, I was very curious.
[02:25:05.659 --> 02:25:10.903]  But I did not want to believe that my government could possibly be involved in such a thing.
[02:25:11.023 --> 02:25:14.907]  Absolutely, I don't think any of us wanted to believe that.
[02:25:15.007 --> 02:25:17.389]  I used to live in a country that I thought could be involved.
[02:25:17.409 --> 02:25:17.709]  Exactly.
[02:25:17.769 --> 02:25:20.051]  That was the ultimate betrayal.
[02:25:20.071 --> 02:25:20.171]  Sure.
[02:25:20.191 --> 02:25:23.053]  Then, however, there's been so many revelations that now I have my doubts.
[02:25:28.798 --> 02:25:29.299]  Yes.
[02:25:29.439 --> 02:25:31.782]  And chief among them is the Building 7.
[02:25:32.603 --> 02:25:39.130]  How did they rig that building so that it came down in the evening of the day?
[02:25:39.371 --> 02:25:44.577]  Are you referring to the Larry Silverstein statement, the pull-in, and the public way that it all came down?
[02:25:44.777 --> 02:25:45.358]  Absolutely.
[02:25:45.398 --> 02:25:46.239]  How convenient.
[02:25:46.259 --> 02:25:46.459]  Yes.
[02:25:46.679 --> 02:25:47.901]  When did they rig that building?
[02:25:49.422 --> 02:25:57.411]  That's the most serious question and I have not received a satisfactory answer.
[02:25:57.492 --> 02:26:04.560]  If somebody could give me an answer for how you rigged that building, what a coincidence two weeks prior,
[02:26:05.393 --> 02:26:06.734]  And then bring it down on the deck.
[02:26:07.014 --> 02:26:08.636]  That is a curiosity, isn't it?
[02:26:08.656 --> 02:26:12.779]  That's the one thing that I have gotten a satisfactory answer from anyone.
[02:26:12.859 --> 02:26:17.122]  Have you looked into how NORAD just didn't respond in the normal manner?
[02:26:17.142 --> 02:26:18.703]  Their protocol was not followed?
[02:26:18.744 --> 02:26:20.325]  Do you have any thoughts on that?
[02:26:20.365 --> 02:26:22.226]  Because we're kind of wondering about that as well.
[02:26:22.306 --> 02:26:23.767]  I have something to wonder about.
[02:26:23.827 --> 02:26:27.230]  Although, I have had some people in the military say that it's not... Right.
[02:26:27.350 --> 02:26:28.251]  It is the military.
[02:26:28.271 --> 02:26:28.611]  You know.
[02:26:31.233 --> 02:26:33.794]  Uh, they don't get paid a lot of money.
[02:26:33.814 --> 02:26:36.115]  Not as much as Blackwater.
[02:26:36.395 --> 02:26:49.559]  Now, these scoundrels are... Now, I hear that they've actually extended and broadened their contract for domestic operations for Blackwater, and that's a bit troubling.
[02:26:49.919 --> 02:26:58.122]  Well, it's not surprising, and it's not new, you know, because anytime we go to government facilities to protest,
[02:26:58.782 --> 02:27:04.586]  You know, because you go to a military base, it is rarely the military authorities that arrest you.
[02:27:04.686 --> 02:27:10.849]  It is always private bodies, you know, and turn you over to the local county authorities, you know.
[02:27:10.889 --> 02:27:18.334]  I'm speaking about the test site or about, you know, any number of airport spaces, you know.
[02:27:19.194 --> 02:27:20.155]  Cause for concern.
[02:27:20.175 --> 02:27:22.316]  Well, thank you very, very much for having me.
[02:27:22.336 --> 02:27:23.437]  Very good to see you.
[02:27:23.477 --> 02:27:24.877]  Bill Charlie Stewart says hello.
[02:27:24.917 --> 02:27:26.078]  Bill, good to see you.
[02:27:26.218 --> 02:27:27.039]  Good to see you.
[02:27:28.974 --> 02:27:32.318]  All right, that is the Martin Sheen interview in its entirety.
[02:27:32.358 --> 02:27:33.199]  A lot better audio.
[02:27:33.239 --> 02:27:34.060]  There it is for him.
[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:35.081]  First time you heard that.
[02:27:35.882 --> 02:27:47.496]  And coming up, before the show ends, we're going to air the Mark Ruffalo interview that was done right after that with WeAreChangeLosAngeles.org.
[02:27:49.446 --> 02:27:59.370]  And of course, again, my friends, you can find out more about all of this at PrisonPlanet.com, all the links, the audio, the documents, the NIST report backing up Mr. Sheen's concerns.
[02:28:00.890 --> 02:28:07.893]  When the media tries to spin this, call in to talk radio, call in everywhere and point out that NIST are the ones saying this.
[02:28:07.913 --> 02:28:17.957]  The National Institute of Standards and Technology, the federal government, is having to look at controlled demolitions now because they've given five different reasons the tower fell and they've all said those were wrong.
[02:28:18.832 --> 02:28:21.334]  This is science that we're talking about.
[02:28:21.354 --> 02:28:24.816]  We're going to come back, blast through five or six of your phone calls with our guests.
[02:28:25.416 --> 02:28:29.019]  All three of them get a final comment from the We Are Change New York and Los Angeles.
[02:28:31.420 --> 02:28:35.223]  And callers have your questions and comments ready because I'm going to write to you on the other side.
[02:28:35.243 --> 02:28:40.746]  Then you're going to be able to hear the Mark Ruffalo interview as well for the first time ever.
[02:28:40.786 --> 02:28:41.607]  We are honored.
[02:28:43.288 --> 02:28:44.369]  We're on the march.
[02:28:44.689 --> 02:28:46.210]  The empire's on the run.
[02:28:47.205 --> 02:28:50.067]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:53.329 --> 02:28:53.990]  It's a fact.
[02:28:54.210 --> 02:29:01.695]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:29:01.815 --> 02:29:08.200]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:08.480]  I think?
[02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:39.461]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[02:29:39.501 --> 02:29:42.142]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:29:42.162 --> 02:29:46.905]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:30:03.995 --> 02:30:06.597]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[02:30:07.157 --> 02:30:11.480]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run.
[02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:13.882]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:30:14.302 --> 02:30:19.545]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[02:30:19.985 --> 02:30:21.627]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[02:30:22.147 --> 02:30:25.369]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[02:30:25.949 --> 02:30:29.331]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[02:30:29.371 --> 02:30:36.354]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[02:30:36.714 --> 02:30:42.116]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.
[02:30:42.437 --> 02:30:45.338]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now!
[02:30:45.598 --> 02:30:45.998]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:30:46.018 --> 02:30:46.378]  That's 888-873-7371 today!
[02:30:53.032 --> 02:30:56.474]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[02:30:56.714 --> 02:30:58.835]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[02:30:58.975 --> 02:31:01.436]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[02:31:01.696 --> 02:31:06.039]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[02:31:06.079 --> 02:31:06.759]  Here's why.
[02:31:07.179 --> 02:31:13.102]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[02:31:13.342 --> 02:31:19.345]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[02:31:19.585 --> 02:31:20.506]  But they're not cheating.
[02:31:20.726 --> 02:31:24.729]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[02:31:24.930 --> 02:31:29.253]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[02:31:29.353 --> 02:31:36.879]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[02:31:36.900 --> 02:31:37.460]  Get control.
[02:31:37.720 --> 02:31:46.147]  Get relief, get some sleep, go to www.outin90.com, that's www.outin90.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365, that's 877-327-0365.
[02:32:06.218 --> 02:32:06.539]  I think?
[02:32:12.831 --> 02:32:13.251]  I think.
[02:32:42.971 --> 02:32:45.554]  All right, Luke Rodowski's got to go back into college, back into class.
[02:32:45.574 --> 02:32:46.535]  I want to say bye to him.
[02:32:47.035 --> 02:32:48.337]  Luke, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:32:48.397 --> 02:32:49.298]  I salute you, my friend.
[02:32:50.098 --> 02:32:51.039]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:32:51.059 --> 02:32:52.000]  Keep up the great job, man.
[02:32:52.020 --> 02:32:52.761]  We're never going to stop.
[02:32:53.041 --> 02:32:54.483]  Thanks for helping all the first responders.
[02:32:54.503 --> 02:32:54.843]  Take care.
[02:32:54.863 --> 02:32:57.466]  All right, let's jam in some calls.
[02:32:57.626 --> 02:33:02.491]  Anthony in Arizona, you're on to the air with We Are Change Los Angeles, who confronted Bill Maher.
[02:33:02.771 --> 02:33:05.534]  And now I've got an interview with Martin Sheen and others.
[02:33:06.463 --> 02:33:06.983]  Hi Alex.
[02:33:07.684 --> 02:33:10.265]  I just want to tell you, you guys keep bringing up Digg.
[02:33:10.426 --> 02:33:11.626]  Stop using Digg.
[02:33:11.666 --> 02:33:17.570]  No matter how many times they Digg your story, they're not going to put it on the front page.
[02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:18.210]  That's not true.
[02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:22.453]  We get on Digg every week on the main page and get hundreds of thousands of viewers.
[02:33:23.234 --> 02:33:28.497]  Okay, well I just want to give you guys an alternative and I called about this the other day to use my site.
[02:33:29.213 --> 02:33:34.355]  My site is better than Dig, and my site helps... But is your site number 40 on the web?
[02:33:34.895 --> 02:33:38.677]  No, but it can be, because my site is replicated... Okay, plug your site.
[02:33:38.697 --> 02:33:39.957]  We're talking about 9-11 stuff right now.
[02:33:39.977 --> 02:33:40.658]  Go ahead, plug your site.
[02:33:41.138 --> 02:33:41.718]  Duplinks.
[02:33:41.918 --> 02:33:45.039]  D-U-P-L-I-N-K-S dot com.
[02:33:45.059 --> 02:33:45.780]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:46.420]  I appreciate it.
[02:33:46.440 --> 02:33:47.961]  Brian, in California.
[02:33:48.001 --> 02:33:48.581]  You're on the air.
[02:33:48.641 --> 02:33:48.961]  Welcome.
[02:33:50.208 --> 02:33:50.688]  How are you doing?
[02:33:50.889 --> 02:33:51.569]  Good, go ahead.
[02:33:52.210 --> 02:33:59.256]  Hey, I've got a question about the interview between Jerome Corsi and Glenn Beck that happened last Wednesday.
[02:34:00.077 --> 02:34:00.977]  I didn't see that.
[02:34:01.218 --> 02:34:02.659]  It was about North American Union, right?
[02:34:03.239 --> 02:34:03.960]  Correct, yeah.
[02:34:03.980 --> 02:34:07.143]  He sounded just like he was taking lessons from you and Jerome.
[02:34:08.721 --> 02:34:13.426]  Well, I mean, Beck does some things that are good, but then he basically attacks the First Amendment and says, I'm evil.
[02:34:13.907 --> 02:34:14.768]  So that's his problem.
[02:34:15.268 --> 02:34:18.752]  Well, I'm trying to find a video on that, so I could go ahead and record it.
[02:34:18.772 --> 02:34:20.674]  I haven't seen the video, but it is on YouTube.
[02:34:20.714 --> 02:34:23.157]  They were trying to show it to me in the office, and I refused to watch it.
[02:34:23.618 --> 02:34:25.299]  I can't stand looking at Beck.
[02:34:25.340 --> 02:34:26.361]  He's so sniveling and weird.
[02:34:26.941 --> 02:34:27.421]  I don't think so.
[02:34:45.535 --> 02:34:52.385]  Well, okay, I was just wondering because it is mainstream and it was something that you probably could have used showing that, yes, this is true.
[02:34:52.665 --> 02:34:56.751]  I know Beck, you know, he wants to remain ignorant about 9-11.
[02:34:57.392 --> 02:35:00.956]  But you should probably use mainstream just with that interview.
[02:35:01.957 --> 02:35:08.960]  I was going to say Fox saying it's North American Union and Amero, and we have their own documents, and the public still believes the media lying, but they're starting to wake up.
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:09.621]  Anything else, sir?
[02:35:10.081 --> 02:35:10.461]  No, no.
[02:35:10.601 --> 02:35:12.722]  Thank you very much for waking us up, Alex.
[02:35:12.882 --> 02:35:13.622]  Brian, thank you.
[02:35:13.662 --> 02:35:14.243]  God bless you.
[02:35:14.303 --> 02:35:16.644]  John in Alabama, you're on the air with We Are Change LA.
[02:35:17.384 --> 02:35:17.864]  Hi, Alex.
[02:35:17.964 --> 02:35:22.046]  I'd like to salute you and Ron Paul for uploading Real American Values.
[02:35:22.726 --> 02:35:27.408]  I know you're trying to blast through calls, but I've got maybe five things.
[02:35:27.448 --> 02:35:29.049]  I'll try and mention them briefly in a question.
[02:35:31.041 --> 02:35:35.906]  I haven't heard Dov Zachary mentioned very much before in your program.
[02:35:35.946 --> 02:35:36.667]  Are you familiar with him?
[02:35:36.807 --> 02:35:39.990]  Oh yeah, he's one of the big top neocons, one of their big war planners.
[02:35:40.010 --> 02:35:43.273]  Go ahead and fill folks in on him.
[02:35:44.154 --> 02:35:47.857]  On another program there on GCN, I heard a guy talking about him.
[02:35:48.917 --> 02:35:58.543]  I read the article, and he may be onto something here, because he's saying that he was the comp controller for the Pentagon when trillions were missing before 9-11.
[02:35:58.583 --> 02:35:59.103]  That's true.
[02:35:59.563 --> 02:36:08.128]  And that when the supposed plane hit the Pentagon, that it destroyed a lot of the record.
[02:36:08.168 --> 02:36:10.650]  Yeah, he ran the company that developed those technologies.
[02:36:11.210 --> 02:36:16.754]  And it's saying that he has a dual citizenship, U.S.
[02:36:16.794 --> 02:36:17.374]  and Israeli.
[02:36:18.098 --> 02:36:28.503]  And uh... he uh... uh... got all these uh... uh... well uh... that all these airplanes disappeared under his watch and uh... he had all these seven things.
[02:36:28.523 --> 02:36:34.366]  Doug Zachheim is key and uh... we have actually had guests on to talk about him in the last three years.
[02:36:34.406 --> 02:36:36.086]  We've been talking about Zachheim for three or four years.
[02:36:36.927 --> 02:36:40.829]  Uh... it's just a lot of people have a tendency to cover something four or five times and then not go back to it.
[02:36:40.849 --> 02:36:41.769]  We need to do that.
[02:36:41.789 --> 02:36:46.051]  Uh... also Kurt Nimmo who writes for TruthNews.us has written about him.
[02:36:46.810 --> 02:36:48.751]  And so, yes sir, we are on top of it.
[02:36:49.031 --> 02:36:55.115]  And it's talking about how it looks like one of the planes that hit the World Trade Center might have been one of his tankers.
[02:36:55.155 --> 02:36:55.795]  That was a 767.
[02:36:57.376 --> 02:37:02.999]  The article is following Zach Hyman, Pentagon trillions to Israel in 9-11.
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:04.640]  Thank you so much.
[02:37:04.660 --> 02:37:05.861]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:37:07.378 --> 02:37:12.001]  Let's go ahead and make one more call, and I'm going to spend some time with our guest here in closing before I air this final clip.
[02:37:12.362 --> 02:37:13.563]  Sean in Illinois, go ahead.
[02:37:14.063 --> 02:37:17.325]  Yeah, Alex, I just want to say it's such an honor and a blessing to talk with you.
[02:37:17.345 --> 02:37:20.668]  I can't even describe how much you've done for me and so many people.
[02:37:20.688 --> 02:37:30.675]  I just wanted to say I know you get frustrated trying to get through to people, and it's just like Jesus said in the Bible, though seeing they do not see and though hearing they will never hear or understand.
[02:37:31.115 --> 02:37:32.576]  I just had one question for you.
[02:37:34.082 --> 02:37:42.746]  All these people waking up is a great thing, but do you think that this is going to accelerate the New World Order's agenda as far as trying to shut these people down?
[02:37:42.767 --> 02:37:43.927]  You know what I mean?
[02:37:44.848 --> 02:37:46.909]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[02:37:47.369 --> 02:37:55.133]  If we wouldn't have exposed government-sponsored terror and exposed their favorite tool, a problem reaction solution, they would have already carried out bigger events.
[02:37:55.193 --> 02:37:59.135]  Now we'll probably force them to move, but that way they have that much better chance losing.
[02:38:00.334 --> 02:38:02.015]  Absolutely.
[02:38:02.136 --> 02:38:03.257]  It's just kind of scary.
[02:38:03.297 --> 02:38:07.181]  I just feel like Alex, man, you're doing so great.
[02:38:07.842 --> 02:38:08.462]  So great.
[02:38:09.523 --> 02:38:10.605]  I can't describe it to you.
[02:38:12.409 --> 02:38:18.373]  In a couple years, I just wonder, you know, these people, these governments, they're so... You know, you're marveling at how evil they are and how out of control they are.
[02:38:18.653 --> 02:38:19.454]  We don't have a choice.
[02:38:19.474 --> 02:38:22.576]  They're coming down on us with World War III and police state and New World Order.
[02:38:23.096 --> 02:38:24.938]  And all I know is I'm not laying down to them.
[02:38:24.958 --> 02:38:25.558]  I'm going to fight them.
[02:38:26.258 --> 02:38:29.461]  And people couldn't even believe we could ever fight them 5, 6, 10, 12 years ago.
[02:38:29.801 --> 02:38:31.642]  Now people are going to realize we can fight them.
[02:38:31.862 --> 02:38:32.283]  Yeah, I know.
[02:38:32.363 --> 02:38:33.383]  Alex, you're doing great, man.
[02:38:33.944 --> 02:38:34.864]  I totally love you.
[02:38:34.884 --> 02:38:37.426]  I've got all your videos, man, and I totally support you.
[02:38:37.906 --> 02:38:41.609]  And I try to do everything I can to talk to my family and everything I just, you know,
[02:38:42.162 --> 02:38:43.603]  The future does worry me.
[02:38:43.843 --> 02:38:45.884]  That's all I wanted to say to you.
[02:38:45.944 --> 02:38:46.884]  Keep doing what you're doing.
[02:38:46.984 --> 02:38:48.845]  I support you 100%, man.
[02:38:49.245 --> 02:38:49.685]  Thank you.
[02:38:49.765 --> 02:38:50.746]  I really appreciate that.
[02:38:51.146 --> 02:39:01.731]  Gentleman from WeAreChangeLA.org, links up on PrisonPlanet.com to your organization if folks want to join and get involved in the Second American Revolution against the globalists.
[02:39:02.591 --> 02:39:06.493]  What about the question he just said about they're too big, they're too bad, they're too evil?
[02:39:08.474 --> 02:39:10.255]  I mean, just kind of that idea.
[02:39:10.315 --> 02:39:10.955]  What do you say to that?
[02:39:11.894 --> 02:39:13.856]  Well, let me pipe in on that, Alex.
[02:39:14.716 --> 02:39:21.562]  You know, a great leader, Martin Luther King, once said, you know, there comes a time when silence is betrayal.
[02:39:22.583 --> 02:39:24.204]  And we're in that time.
[02:39:25.385 --> 02:39:27.387]  You know, our backs are against the wall.
[02:39:27.467 --> 02:39:28.788]  They're going to annihilate us.
[02:39:28.828 --> 02:39:29.649]  They're going to kill us.
[02:39:30.149 --> 02:39:31.510]  They're going to destroy our country.
[02:39:32.731 --> 02:39:39.657]  If you won't stand up now with us, then you won't have the option to stand up with us later.
[02:39:40.117 --> 02:39:40.818]  You can't wait.
[02:39:41.263 --> 02:39:42.744]  We have to do something today.
[02:39:42.804 --> 02:39:49.948]  We have to confront these evil neocons and awful people that are destroying our country.
[02:39:52.129 --> 02:39:53.150]  Absolutely.
[02:39:54.131 --> 02:39:55.371]  Comments to that, Sam?
[02:39:55.391 --> 02:39:58.253]  Stuart, yeah.
[02:39:58.313 --> 02:40:01.195]  You know, it's like being in 1930s Germany.
[02:40:01.335 --> 02:40:07.839]  You know, we see it coming and we see it happening all around us and it's really wonderful to be able to be part of
[02:40:08.763 --> 02:40:11.465]  of the truth and integrity of humanity to stand up.
[02:40:11.966 --> 02:40:13.487]  And it's really about the journey, you know?
[02:40:13.547 --> 02:40:21.253]  It feels so wonderful to be on the journey and to feel like we're tapped into, you know, the good energy in the world.
[02:40:21.313 --> 02:40:27.638]  It's very empowering and I think as more people join us, it'll help other people, you know, get off the bench and into the game.
[02:40:28.479 --> 02:40:36.285]  It's exciting, it's empowering, and it's just so important that we just do whatever we can, whether it's talking honestly about what we believe with our friends or co-workers,
[02:40:36.750 --> 02:40:41.036]  Or, you know, coming and joining up with other people and speaking out against lies.
[02:40:41.056 --> 02:40:47.464]  You know, it's just important and it's empowering and it's just wonderful once you really get up and start taking action.
[02:40:47.524 --> 02:40:54.834]  It's just a beautiful thing from what I've seen and I want to thank you guys for helping me to find some groups and people to be part of.
[02:40:56.289 --> 02:41:11.598]  Absolutely, and in the next 6, 7, 8 hours we should be able to look at the We Are Change LA website and see the video up on YouTube and Google of the Martin Sheen and of course Mark Ruffalo interview that you guys did on Saturday.
[02:41:11.698 --> 02:41:12.979]  I salute you for your work.
[02:41:13.039 --> 02:41:14.379]  Thank you for contacting me.
[02:41:14.439 --> 02:41:21.844]  Thank you for contacting us to bring this out first here on the show other than the message boards and things where Fox could just have their way with us.
[02:41:22.324 --> 02:41:23.364]  I want to thank you for coming on.
[02:41:23.384 --> 02:41:24.205]  We'll talk to you very soon.
[02:41:25.393 --> 02:41:26.374]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:41:27.235 --> 02:41:28.297]  We're with you 100%.
[02:41:28.737 --> 02:41:29.679]  Well, we'll be in touch.
[02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:31.000]  Me too.
[02:41:31.020 --> 02:41:33.303]  We're on the same page, my friend.
[02:41:33.323 --> 02:41:36.267]  We are brothers in arms on the front lines of the Info War.
[02:41:36.808 --> 02:41:37.528]  You're not behind me.
[02:41:37.549 --> 02:41:39.030]  You're beside me, and I'm right beside you.
[02:41:39.070 --> 02:41:39.571]  God bless you.
[02:41:39.992 --> 02:41:40.592]  God bless you.
[02:41:41.293 --> 02:41:41.834]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:41:42.275 --> 02:41:42.735]  Take care.
[02:41:42.975 --> 02:41:43.336]  All right.
[02:41:48.382 --> 02:41:53.344]  Here is the short interview that they did at the anti-war rally.
[02:41:53.384 --> 02:42:03.468]  The 20-plus thousand people attended in Southern California on Saturday afternoon, where they interviewed Mark Ruffalo.
[02:42:04.468 --> 02:42:09.390]  And he has been in just more than 50 movies, all these major television programs.
[02:42:09.410 --> 02:42:16.293]  He's a top-tier actor, and he's recently been in Blindless, The Brothers Bloom, Margaret,
[02:42:17.162 --> 02:42:20.004]  Reservation Road, Zodiac, All the King's Men.
[02:42:20.024 --> 02:42:21.124]  This is just the last year.
[02:42:22.525 --> 02:42:34.891]  Rumor has it, just like heaven, collateral, 13 going on 30, eternal sunshine of a spotless mind, we don't live here anymore, in the cut, view from the top, my life without me.
[02:42:38.193 --> 02:42:43.636]  Here is the audio of another amazing individual, Mark Ruffalo,
[02:42:45.146 --> 02:42:50.809]  There with Martin Sheen speaking to the camera about questioning the official 9-11 story.
[02:42:51.289 --> 02:42:58.253]  You can go and hear the audio at PrisonPlanet.com along with Martin Sheen's audio as well.
[02:42:58.293 --> 02:42:58.613]  Here it is.
[02:42:59.802 --> 02:43:02.184]  I'm totally asking the same question.
[02:43:02.204 --> 02:43:07.147]  You know, we weren't really shown filming much in the media after the first day.
[02:43:07.227 --> 02:43:10.789]  I was wondering if you were aware of it or if you'd seen the way it came down.
[02:43:10.809 --> 02:43:15.653]  I saw the way they all came down and I was baffled.
[02:43:15.693 --> 02:43:19.135]  My first reaction is that filming stuff falls out like that.
[02:43:19.175 --> 02:43:19.435]  Right.
[02:43:21.276 --> 02:43:49.263]  You know, I've done quite a bit of my own research and, um, you know, I've been debunking and, you know, there's so much information that's been put out there, like the 9-11, and so much of it has been kind of stretched that a lot of people are grabbing a hold of the more, kind of, sensational parts of what doesn't jive with the story to discredit the movie.
[02:43:52.233 --> 02:43:53.054]  We're good to go.
[02:44:15.931 --> 02:44:28.400]  The fact that the 9-11 investigation went from the moment the planes hit to the moment the buildings fell and nothing before and nothing after, I think makes that investigation completely illogical.
[02:44:28.541 --> 02:44:37.007]  It makes, you know, you're going to do a crime investigation, you have to find motive, you have to find... Right, you know, you don't have to be... We didn't follow that.
[02:44:37.047 --> 02:44:37.647]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:44:37.828 --> 02:44:40.369]  It was quickly pushed away obviously.
[02:44:40.389 --> 02:44:42.651]  Sure, the evidence was removed from the crime scene.
[02:44:42.691 --> 02:44:43.692]  There was a lot of evidence.
[02:44:43.752 --> 02:44:44.953]  It's the biggest crime scene.
[02:44:45.153 --> 02:44:47.594]  We don't have Zinzinger in charge of it either.
[02:44:47.734 --> 02:44:51.217]  Yes, and Zinzinger had tried to make Jones lie to you.
[02:44:51.337 --> 02:45:02.143]  Senator Max Fleeland, who was originally on the commission, left in disgust, and he said that, I believe, the investigation has been compromised.
[02:45:02.203 --> 02:45:03.924]  Those were his exact words.
[02:45:04.024 --> 02:45:05.785]  Well, listen, who knows?
[02:45:07.206 --> 02:45:09.588]  None of us know what happens after we go.
[02:45:09.728 --> 02:45:15.832]  What we do, I'm totally and completely behind re-opening that particular... Where is that money?
[02:45:16.573 --> 02:45:18.614]  All of the money goes to Ashley K. Bono.
[02:45:18.634 --> 02:45:19.655]  Who benefits?
[02:45:19.775 --> 02:45:21.216]  You raise a very good point.
[02:45:21.456 --> 02:45:30.722]  I think the essence of the scientific process is to eliminate the things that aren't possible, thereby ending up with the likelihood of what was possible.
[02:45:30.982 --> 02:45:32.343]  So thank you for chatting with us.
[02:45:32.383 --> 02:45:33.124]  We appreciate it.
[02:45:33.164 --> 02:45:34.064]  My pleasure.
[02:45:34.284 --> 02:45:34.525]  Thanks.
[02:45:34.645 --> 02:45:36.646]  It was a real pleasure to meet you guys.
[02:45:37.587 --> 02:45:50.557]  Alright, so there's Rivolo saying he's got a big problem with what happened with the buildings, he's got a big problem with the whitewash investigation in Kissinger, and that he'd like to see the real experts who've been questioning get attention instead of the kooks.
[02:45:51.318 --> 02:45:54.520]  But a lot of those guys are coming tele-pro, the others are their mentally ill followers.
[02:45:55.381 --> 02:45:58.904]  And then all they do is come into the 9-11 and truth movement to tackle the real investigators,
[02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:03.583]  Notice they didn't just come out with their space beams and their holograms.
[02:46:03.623 --> 02:46:10.129]  They also then come out and attack all the real investigators and physicists and architects and scientists and spend all their time doing that.
[02:46:10.209 --> 02:46:13.011]  Showing how incredibly nasty they are.
[02:46:13.111 --> 02:46:14.553]  We've really been restrained and attacking them.
[02:46:15.173 --> 02:46:16.775]  Least too much attention is given to them.
[02:46:17.816 --> 02:46:20.238]  But you can tell that they are constantly put on television.
[02:46:20.760 --> 02:46:23.921]  They only gave me a few shots and after I blew them away I was never back on there.
[02:46:24.462 --> 02:46:27.123]  But these guys that put out total disinfo, they put them on over and over again.
[02:46:27.423 --> 02:46:30.264]  Now the really powerful interview is with Martin Sheen.
[02:46:30.564 --> 02:46:34.486]  Let's hear that one more time, the crisp audio, in case you just tuned in and missed it.
[02:46:34.526 --> 02:46:37.427]  This is Saturday, Martin Sheen questioning the official story.
[02:46:37.747 --> 02:46:40.649]  Now at first, you know, he didn't question it, but over time he did.
[02:46:40.689 --> 02:46:40.969]  Here it is.
[02:46:41.489 --> 02:46:50.212]  I'm involved these days, I'm trying to bring awareness to the 9-11 situation and kind of the option of that being the war and the patriots and what not.
[02:46:50.352 --> 02:46:58.535]  I'm just wondering, you know, what your take was on it and, you know, has anything to do with that, what we can do to help the situation?
[02:46:58.575 --> 02:47:00.716]  You know, I don't know what to suggest.
[02:47:00.756 --> 02:47:06.698]  You know, when there was a lot of questions about it, my son introduced me to a lot of information.
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:16.281]  Until then, which is just like last year, I was very dubious.
[02:47:16.321 --> 02:47:22.044]  But I did not want to believe that my government would possibly be involved in such a thing.
[02:47:22.064 --> 02:47:25.785]  Absolutely, I don't think any of us would.
[02:47:25.805 --> 02:47:29.087]  I used to live in a country that I thought that would be ultimately betrayed.
[02:47:29.127 --> 02:47:33.949]  Then, however, there's been so many revelations that now I have my doubts.
[02:47:39.891 --> 02:47:43.053]  And chief among them is the Building 7.
[02:47:43.873 --> 02:47:50.056]  How did they rig that building so that it came down in the evening of the day?
[02:47:50.276 --> 02:47:55.458]  Are you afraid of the Larry Silverski statement, Napoleon, and the public way that it all came down?
[02:47:55.678 --> 02:47:56.258]  Absolutely.
[02:47:56.298 --> 02:47:57.879]  When did they rig that building?
[02:48:00.340 --> 02:48:00.861]  You are.
[02:48:00.981 --> 02:48:08.565]  And then once you... That's the most materialist question, and I have not received a satisfactory answer.
[02:48:08.585 --> 02:48:10.427]  Somebody could give me an answer.
[02:48:10.707 --> 02:48:13.308]  For now, you make that note.
[02:48:13.729 --> 02:48:15.430]  What a coincidence, two weeks prior...
[02:48:16.330 --> 02:48:17.591]  And then bring it down on the deck.
[02:48:17.932 --> 02:48:19.553]  That is a curiosity, isn't it?
[02:48:19.573 --> 02:48:23.717]  That's the one thing that I have gotten a satisfactory answer from anyone.
[02:48:23.797 --> 02:48:28.020]  Have you looked into how NORAD just didn't respond in the normal manner?
[02:48:28.060 --> 02:48:29.622]  Their protocol was not followed?
[02:48:29.662 --> 02:48:31.203]  Do you have any thoughts on that?
[02:48:31.223 --> 02:48:32.964]  Because we're kind of wondering about that as well.
[02:48:32.984 --> 02:48:34.145]  That's something to wonder about.
[02:48:34.246 --> 02:48:38.769]  Although, I have had some people in the military say that this is not a... Right.
[02:48:38.910 --> 02:48:40.451]  It is a military, you know.
[02:48:41.872 --> 02:48:44.073]  They don't get paid a lot of money.
[02:48:44.113 --> 02:48:47.134]  Not as much as Blackwater.
[02:48:47.314 --> 02:49:00.479]  Now these scoundrels are telling me that that leads to all these... Now I hear that they've actually extended and broadened their contract for domestic operations for Blackwater, and that's a bit troubling.
[02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:09.103]  Well, I think it's not surprising, and it's not new, you know, because anytime we go to government facilities to protest,
[02:49:09.723 --> 02:49:15.507]  You know, like, if you go to a military base, it is rarely the military authorities that are rescuing you.
[02:49:15.587 --> 02:49:17.728]  It is always private contractors.
[02:49:17.768 --> 02:49:18.108]  Yeah.
[02:49:18.549 --> 02:49:21.931]  And turn you over to the local county authorities.
[02:49:22.151 --> 02:49:25.893]  I'm speaking about the test site or about the... Alright.
[02:49:26.193 --> 02:49:31.717]  We're going to break and come back in the final segments and some of my reflections on this today.
[02:49:33.478 --> 02:49:36.860]  But that's how to get around a positive commentatus is using private military contractors.
[02:49:37.828 --> 02:49:42.312]  Now 180,000 of them plus in action in Iraq, and you know someday they're all coming home.
[02:49:42.852 --> 02:49:43.653]  We'll be right back.
[02:49:43.693 --> 02:49:45.474]  An amazing day for the Truth Movement.
[02:49:45.775 --> 02:49:53.041]  Stay with us.
[02:49:54.142 --> 02:49:55.543]  It is a big idea.
[02:49:56.624 --> 02:49:57.664]  A new world order.
[02:49:58.385 --> 02:50:02.628]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[02:50:03.269 --> 02:50:05.391]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:50:06.087 --> 02:50:08.308]  Wouldn't their objection be world domination?
[02:50:08.869 --> 02:50:11.330]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:50:12.050 --> 02:50:19.374]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:50:22.386 --> 02:50:27.389]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:50:27.870 --> 02:50:31.332]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:50:31.712 --> 02:50:34.214]  Bill Burdick is making great progress for the world government.
[02:50:34.274 --> 02:50:35.275]  Most people have no idea.
[02:50:35.295 --> 02:50:36.195]  They're not after money.
[02:50:36.215 --> 02:50:37.296]  They have all the money they need.
[02:50:37.496 --> 02:50:37.936]  They're after power.
[02:50:37.956 --> 02:50:39.277]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[02:51:04.961 --> 02:51:09.527]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:51:10.007 --> 02:51:12.149]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:52:40.347 --> 02:52:45.549]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[02:52:46.069 --> 02:52:49.131]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[02:52:49.151 --> 02:52:52.072]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:52:59.315 --> 02:53:08.019]  We don't want the fact that George Carlin questioned the official 9-11 investigation and said they had a new one, it'd be a whitewash, and then he never buys into the official narrative.
[02:53:09.202 --> 02:53:27.189]  The received reality that they've given to us when he was asked about We Are Change LA confronting the week before Bill Maher He just said, yeah, what do you think of them confronting him, Bill Maher and 9-11 Truth?
[02:53:27.209 --> 02:53:30.850]  Oh, well, I don't buy the official reality and what about an investigation?
[02:53:30.870 --> 02:53:32.551]  They're not going to have a real investigation.
[02:53:32.591 --> 02:53:33.751]  They don't investigate themselves.
[02:53:34.472 --> 02:53:38.193]  An investigation about 9-11 and George Carlin saying, well, they're not going to investigate themselves.
[02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:42.482]  He's saying right there, inside job, I mean he's 98% there.
[02:53:42.722 --> 02:53:44.122]  He's certainly saying there's a cover-up.
[02:53:44.783 --> 02:53:47.664]  That is a huge story up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:53:47.684 --> 02:53:49.685]  We need to add that in by the way, the Martin Sheen one.
[02:53:50.385 --> 02:53:52.246]  Get some synergy between those two articles.
[02:53:53.207 --> 02:53:58.809]  I want to commend everybody that's done 600 and something digs in two hours.
[02:53:58.829 --> 02:54:02.771]  651 digs in two hours up on Prison Planet.
[02:54:02.791 --> 02:54:06.433]  They're going to have a lot of trouble keeping that off the main page, but we'll see what happens with these censors.
[02:54:08.829 --> 02:54:12.191]  By the way, they banned me outright before in January of this year.
[02:54:12.211 --> 02:54:13.212]  They've just backed off that.
[02:54:13.252 --> 02:54:15.833]  So they are admitted censors in the past.
[02:54:15.853 --> 02:54:19.155]  You know, oil rose to a near record $93 a barrel today.
[02:54:19.195 --> 02:54:20.236]  The dollar plunged even more.
[02:54:20.576 --> 02:54:21.436]  It goes down every week.
[02:54:21.456 --> 02:54:22.317]  Continuable slide.
[02:54:22.357 --> 02:54:23.097]  Total crises.
[02:54:23.117 --> 02:54:24.078]  We'll be covering that tomorrow.
[02:54:27.230 --> 02:54:29.172]  You know, I really haven't spent much time today on Endgame.
[02:54:29.212 --> 02:54:30.233]  It's officially out today.
[02:54:30.273 --> 02:54:31.314]  The DVDs are shipping.
[02:54:31.914 --> 02:54:33.175]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:54:33.195 --> 02:54:34.176]  The Elite Master Plan.
[02:54:34.216 --> 02:54:36.779]  It's up to you, the listeners, to make this film be effective.
[02:54:36.819 --> 02:54:37.539]  Get the DVD.
[02:54:37.579 --> 02:54:41.142]  That supports us so we can make more films and make copies of it and give it to people.
[02:54:42.864 --> 02:54:43.785]  This is the big story.
[02:54:43.825 --> 02:54:45.266]  Frankly, it's even bigger than 9-11.
[02:54:45.286 --> 02:54:47.648]  9-11, though, they got caught with their pants down.
[02:54:47.688 --> 02:54:48.569]  They overplayed their hand.
[02:54:49.844 --> 02:55:01.788]  And we've got to use it against them, but their public biochemical testing on the people, all the horrible things they've done, that they've killed us in the past has admitted that they want to kill more of us in the future, is a fact.
[02:55:02.348 --> 02:55:04.969]  The government's killed 200 plus million people in the last century.
[02:55:05.409 --> 02:55:06.670]  Endgame documents it all.
[02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:09.511]  Bilderberg Group, North American Union, NAFTA Highways.
[02:55:11.231 --> 02:55:11.632]  It is my...
[02:55:13.271 --> 02:55:13.912]  Masterpiece.
[02:55:14.152 --> 02:55:14.532]  It is.
[02:55:14.552 --> 02:55:17.595]  I mean, I really finally, and my other films are good.
[02:55:18.155 --> 02:55:21.518]  I finally made something that I can really go, whoa, this is what I believe.
[02:55:21.578 --> 02:55:23.199]  This is really, puts it together.
[02:55:23.239 --> 02:55:24.780]  This is really what I wanted to bring you.
[02:55:25.421 --> 02:55:28.143]  A big picture, and then a lot of detail as well.
[02:55:28.183 --> 02:55:30.105]  Two hours, 20 minutes, 40 minutes of extras.

[02:56:02.850 --> 02:56:04.430]  We're just discounting in-game out of the gates.
[02:56:04.490 --> 02:56:05.110]  I want to move it.
[02:56:05.170 --> 02:56:06.031]  I want to get it out there.
[02:56:06.391 --> 02:56:07.611]  I want you to make copies of it.
[02:56:07.911 --> 02:56:08.772]  Yeah, it's on Google Video.
[02:56:08.792 --> 02:56:10.632]  Everybody's asking, should we take it down, Alex?
[02:56:10.652 --> 02:56:11.673]  You know, on the web.
[02:56:12.453 --> 02:56:14.113]  People on the message board, Alex, you're not going to make any money.
[02:56:14.453 --> 02:56:14.994]  So what?
[02:56:15.094 --> 02:56:16.054]  Just enjoy yourselves.
[02:56:17.035 --> 02:56:18.656]  I mean, it's just about saving people.
[02:56:19.016 --> 02:56:19.916]  Now, it looks horrible.
[02:56:19.976 --> 02:56:22.857]  It's a horrible, cruddy video, but it's better than nothing.
[02:56:22.877 --> 02:56:23.577]  Spread that around.
[02:56:23.937 --> 02:56:29.699]  But go to PrisonPlanet.tv and spend 15 cents to watch it in incredible quality.
