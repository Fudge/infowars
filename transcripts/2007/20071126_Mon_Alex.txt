[00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:10.207]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.848 --> 00:00:11.668]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.428 --> 00:00:13.389]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.651]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:22.253]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:40.742]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:42.662]  Welcome to this Monday edition.
[00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:43.603]  We are live.
[00:00:43.663 --> 00:00:46.084]  It is the 26th day of November 2007.
[00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:50.285]  We're going to be here for the next three hours live.
[00:00:50.305 --> 00:00:53.946]  We're going to have open phones in the first, the second, and third hour.
[00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:59.188]  I have a new organization, a national organization, that's taking action right here in Texas.
[00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:04.882]  ConcealedCampus.org joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:17.168]  College students that want more guns on campus, not less, so they can protect themselves from mad killers like the people at Columbine and, of course, the individual in Blacksburg, Virginia.
[00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:25.033]  There's also all sorts of TV news pieces introducing the public to the idea of Knock and Talk,
[00:01:25.763 --> 00:01:35.387]  It's been going on in Dallas, Texas and Phoenix, Arizona and many places you would think of as being more pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment for at least five years.
[00:01:35.407 --> 00:01:42.911]  It's been going on all over the country, but they're doing it in Boston with knock and talk and demanding basically to intimidate their way in.
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.409]  It's all part of this color of law system, and we're going to be breaking that down coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.172]  But I watch more television than I normally view.
[00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:56.016]  I watch a lot of clips online, kind of condensed news coverage.
[00:01:56.476 --> 00:01:58.979]  I read the transcripts of TV programs.
[00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.483]  You can do that a lot faster than actually watching them.
[00:02:02.243 --> 00:02:20.916]  But I ended up on Thanksgiving and on Friday and then on the weekend watching some days, hours of television because I had family in town, football addicts, and it was continual football worship, literally bowing down in front of the television sets.
[00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:25.018]  My uncle, my mother, just teasing, and many others.
[00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:31.603]  But I had a chance to see little news clips before and after, and it was drones in the skies to keep you safe.
[00:02:32.263 --> 00:02:34.966]  Gun searches in your homes to keep you safe.
[00:02:36.127 --> 00:02:39.689]  Blackwater to protect America from terrorists and illegal aliens.
[00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.235]  And coming up next, more cameras in your neighborhoods to watch you and cameras in schools and thumb scanning.
[00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:55.082]  I mean it's just... I don't like watching television and I guess I should really make myself watch more of it because it's just...
[00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:02.395]  Many times worse than even the news that I'm reading online from the newspapers and the TV clips.
[00:03:02.475 --> 00:03:08.561]  It's getting crazier and crazier and crazier by the day.
[00:03:10.062 --> 00:03:16.188]  Some of the important news we'll be covering today is a story out of the Boston Globe.
[00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:27.158]  The Amero conspiracy behind closed doors, the secret cabal is planning the end of the United States as we know it, inside a paranoid vision of our time.
[00:03:27.818 --> 00:03:30.939]  And I read this article last night and I just couldn't believe it.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:42.824]  That they're so bold that they get up and basically accuse us of being liars for saying that the sun comes up in the morning and sets in the evening.
[00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:49.668]  But they're treating you like you're complete and total morons, but we can use this as an opportunity.
[00:03:49.688 --> 00:04:00.173]  We're going to do a news story, either for Truth News or Prison Planet or Jones Report, I'm not sure which one, in the next few days, where we're just going to go through their statements and take their quotes and statements and then put
[00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:24.406]  Links up to David Rockefeller and Robert Pasture and the Council on Foreign Relations and all these groups saying they're setting up a North American Union and saying they're setting up a North American community and saying they're going to basically hand all our infrastructure over to foreign corporations and foreign multinational quasi-governmental groups and just basically blow these people away.
[00:04:25.327 --> 00:04:29.288]  The problem is a fraction of the public reads and
[00:04:31.673 --> 00:04:41.059]  It just sometimes makes my head spin to see the ball face lying that goes on.
[00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.400]  So that's some of what we'll be covering.
[00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:48.023]  That Buchanan says that it's the end of America as we know it.
[00:04:48.464 --> 00:04:53.447]  The UN is coming to the rescue, and I'm being sarcastic, saying tasers are torture.
[00:04:54.087 --> 00:04:56.809]  Hillary's getting in trouble for being in bed with Rupert Murdoch.
[00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:59.070]  Big broadcast lined up today.
[00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.671]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.696 --> 00:05:03.097]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.117 --> 00:05:05.239]  A new world order.
[00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.942]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:10.082 --> 00:05:13.044]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:13.424 --> 00:05:15.906]  Isn't their objective to be world dominated?
[00:05:16.466 --> 00:05:18.908]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.648 --> 00:05:26.993]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:29.972 --> 00:05:34.975]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:38.898]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.298 --> 00:05:41.820]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.021]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:43.781]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:44.862]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.082 --> 00:05:45.863]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.083 --> 00:05:47.204]  That's what they're after, you see.

[00:07:00.894 --> 00:07:02.715]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:08.038]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:07:08.218 --> 00:07:09.559]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:18.004]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:07:18.224 --> 00:07:23.947]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:07:24.107 --> 00:07:25.888]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:07:25.968 --> 00:07:28.108]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:07:28.128 --> 00:07:32.509]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:34.850]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:41.352]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardio...
[00:07:44.053 --> 00:07:44.493]  I think so.
[00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:09.930]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.370]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.131 --> 00:08:12.991]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.691 --> 00:08:17.332]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.892 --> 00:08:21.953]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:49.108]  To set the table of what we face in this society, in a moment I'm going to play just part of a Fox News debate where at first they're acting like they're pro-Second Amendment and one of the pundits on the broadcast, on the transmission, is saying this violates
[00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.371]  Uh, the Fourth Amendment, this violates the Second Amendment.
[00:08:52.832 --> 00:09:01.896]  But then, uh, the majority of the gaggle of guests they have then come in and explain, no, this is freedom, this is good, this keeps us safe.
[00:09:01.956 --> 00:09:11.982]  In fact, here's just a portion of this Fox News propaganda piece about door-to-door, knock-and-talk, hey, let us come in and, uh, see if you have any illegal guns.
[00:09:12.022 --> 00:09:12.362]  Here it is.
[00:09:13.092 --> 00:09:18.559]  Alright, there's a bold new program going into effect in Boston, raising a lot of eyebrows, mine included.
[00:09:18.619 --> 00:09:19.561]  Some of my eyebrows going up.
[00:09:19.781 --> 00:09:28.753]  Police call it Safe Homes, and it allows officers to enter a person's home and search their kid's bedrooms for guns, all without a warrant.
[00:09:29.306 --> 00:09:34.008]  Parents are free to turn down these searches, assuming they understand that clearly.
[00:09:34.468 --> 00:09:41.851]  Critics say this is a violation of the Constitution, but the Boston Police Department says, hey, we're just trying to make our streets safer.
[00:09:41.951 --> 00:09:43.512]  We're not really trying to arrest people.
[00:09:44.332 --> 00:09:45.053]  Yeah.
[00:09:45.213 --> 00:09:46.513]  Our legal panel here now.
[00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:55.457]  Law professor at Pepperdine University out in beautiful California, Matthew Rosengart, and former Westchester County prosecutor and Fox News legal analyst Jeanine Perro joins us.
[00:09:56.068 --> 00:10:10.034]  All right, you know, Matthew, it's the lawyer in me, but boy, knocking on a door without probable cause and reasonable suspicion, you know, intimidating people just in your presence of three cops at your door is intimidating.
[00:10:10.114 --> 00:10:10.834]  I mean, this is
[00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:12.776]  Unconstitutional, isn't it?
[00:10:12.836 --> 00:10:16.880]  Well, I think there's a good chance that it is going to be found to be unconstitutional.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:22.125]  I mean, even any layman, anybody who watches Law & Order or any show knows two things.
[00:10:22.365 --> 00:10:25.589]  One is they have a right not to speak with the police under Miranda.
[00:10:26.049 --> 00:10:30.454]  And two, they have a Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.
[00:10:31.114 --> 00:10:46.281]  This program is clearly an effort to un-run the Constitution, and even if the police play by the book and try to get consent for a search, because there are circumstances, of course, where warrants are not necessary, it's clear that this is ripe for abuse.
[00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:48.962]  People will undoubtedly be intimidated.
[00:10:49.342 --> 00:10:55.005]  You let three policemen or FBI agents show up at your door, it takes a lot of moxie to say, no, you can't come in.
[00:10:55.325 --> 00:11:07.513]  Yeah, but they've got to write, they've got to say, and Jeanine, I guess if a parent wants their local police to come into their home, clearly they have no control over their teenagers, and now they're just hoping somebody will step in.
[00:11:07.553 --> 00:11:09.114]  Right, this is what it is.
[00:11:09.554 --> 00:11:11.696]  It's a safe home, safe streets program.
[00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:23.023]  It is a crime prevention strategy where police, not dressed as police officers, not in uniform, go to homes in dangerous, high-crime neighborhoods where parents are happy to see them.
[00:11:23.443 --> 00:11:34.249]  And then from then on, it's, well, alright, I raised my eyebrow, but it's still funny, ha ha ha, and yeah, people have got a right to say no, but you know what, it's to keep everybody safe.
[00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:35.870]  Let's stop right there.
[00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:48.637]  We had quite a few listeners last week go to the Maryland County seat, Prince George County, where they had sent out letters to all the parents,
[00:11:49.756 --> 00:11:58.304]  The parents of more than 2,000 students saying you must take inoculations, you must take the vaccines or you will be arrested.
[00:11:58.324 --> 00:12:05.431]  We read the letter on air that was sent out and that was posted on the Prince George County Health Department and school websites.
[00:12:05.451 --> 00:12:09.935]  It was posted on multiple sites and they said you've got to go take this or you'll be arrested.
[00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:10.596]  It's the law.
[00:12:11.236 --> 00:12:12.097]  Now we had the
[00:12:13.508 --> 00:12:22.755]  State Attorney, Glenn Ivion, and he said, okay, it isn't really the law, you've got to take the shots, but we expel you for not taking them, and then that triggers criminal penalties for truancy.
[00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:32.802]  And I said, but wait a minute, you're kicking them out for doing something that wasn't wrong or wasn't against the law, and then you're coming after them after you have expelled them from school?
[00:12:33.983 --> 00:12:36.205]  And he kind of hemmed and hawed around that question.
[00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.891]  This is the exact same thing here.
[00:12:38.971 --> 00:12:48.276]  Just like there were police and police dogs herding the 1,000 plus parents in that did show up, about half of them showed up, with their children.
[00:12:49.036 --> 00:12:53.698]  The AP reported, if that's to believe, of the 2,200, over 1,000 showed up.
[00:12:54.479 --> 00:13:00.302]  And they did take the inoculation, and CNN even reported parents thought that they had to be there to take the shots.
[00:13:00.442 --> 00:13:02.583]  No one gave them the waivers.
[00:13:04.223 --> 00:13:05.224]  It's the same thing here.
[00:13:05.922 --> 00:13:12.686]  In Dallas, Texas, and in several of its suburbs, going back five years ago, they call it knock-and-talk.
[00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:25.594]  And as far as we can tell, this started about seven years ago, right before 9-11, in, of all places, one of the strongest Second Amendment states that's left, Arizona.
[00:13:26.554 --> 00:13:32.278]  And the police in Tucson and in Phoenix come to your door, and they knock.
[00:13:33.786 --> 00:13:40.930]  And they say, hello, we'd like to come in and inspect your guns, make sure they're stowed properly, make sure everything is in order.
[00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:49.495]  And they do this, they target homes, they case them beforehand, this has all been in the news, the police say this themselves, it's federally funded grant money.
[00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:57.591]  And then they tend to go to middle class homes, it was reported, because they know the man will be gone on average.
[00:13:57.651 --> 00:14:01.757]  They will then tell the woman of the house, who's there taking care of the children and the family.
[00:14:02.057 --> 00:14:03.199]  And again, this has been in the news.
[00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:06.404]  In Dallas, in Tucson, in Phoenix, it's the same MO.
[00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:08.330]  They do it in New York.
[00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.431]  They do it in L.A.
[00:14:09.471 --> 00:14:10.291]  They do it everywhere.
[00:14:10.331 --> 00:14:12.772]  I mean, I see knock-and-talk articles every day.
[00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:14.452]  This is now called Safe Homes.
[00:14:14.512 --> 00:14:17.973]  I guess they're changing the nomenclature for it.
[00:14:18.533 --> 00:14:20.034]  And they say, we'd like to inspect.
[00:14:20.094 --> 00:14:27.055]  And they come in and they find a gun that's illegal or something they think, a clip that holds too many rounds.
[00:14:27.616 --> 00:14:28.976]  They arrest you.
[00:14:30.717 --> 00:14:31.637]  And they don't say,
[00:14:33.542 --> 00:14:36.385]  Please, if you say, well, why are you here?
[00:14:36.465 --> 00:14:38.127]  Well, we're just inspecting.
[00:14:38.207 --> 00:14:38.968]  Please let us in.
[00:14:38.988 --> 00:14:41.591]  Do you have something to hide?
[00:14:42.251 --> 00:14:52.262]  And the vast majority of people who get this, three police officers, sometimes more, a lot of times they're in the SWAT gear, by the way, with rifles, they let them in.
[00:14:55.383 --> 00:15:00.066]  They like to say, well, we only confiscated guns in New Orleans and surrounding areas and never gave them back.
[00:15:00.086 --> 00:15:01.887]  And, well, we only did that in a few other cities.
[00:15:02.308 --> 00:15:12.094]  They've had secret Marine Corps teams, at least since 1987, aiding police, raiding gun dealers, and raiding gun owners' homes coast to coast.
[00:15:12.614 --> 00:15:14.035]  I have that, by the way, in Road to Tyranny.
[00:15:14.597 --> 00:15:16.659]  With all the documents and all the facts.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:25.229]  They secretly ran Covert Ops to create the key cadres to train larger groups decades ago.
[00:15:26.722 --> 00:15:28.524]  Now they're openly announcing it.
[00:15:28.564 --> 00:15:36.451]  So it's just like 40 years ago saying, oh, it's not a law to take the shots, but we want you to sign a form just so we know who isn't inoculated.
[00:15:36.911 --> 00:15:37.692]  You don't have to.
[00:15:37.712 --> 00:15:39.574]  And then a few years later, yeah, it's the law.
[00:15:39.654 --> 00:15:40.274]  You have to.
[00:15:40.575 --> 00:15:43.958]  And then the public doesn't know to ask for laws or stand up for themselves.
[00:15:43.998 --> 00:15:47.661]  Well, it's the same thing here from Dallas, Texas to Boston, Mass.
[00:15:48.061 --> 00:15:49.222]  This is what they're doing.
[00:15:49.663 --> 00:15:50.624]  And they come to your door.
[00:15:51.304 --> 00:16:01.754]  And they say, uh, yeah, Jimmy's at school right now, we want to search his room, but don't worry, if we find marijuana or we find a gun, uh, we're not gonna arrest Jimmy.
[00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:03.256]  That's a total and complete lie.
[00:16:04.204 --> 00:16:20.741]  And see they have these gun buyback programs where grandpa dies and grandma thinks guns are illegal so she takes in, there was cases in Tennessee, shotguns worth, you know, ten thousand dollars, gold, carb, she doesn't know she could get ten grand for it, the cops are laughing, get caught selling it out the back door.
[00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:26.304]  People coming in and dumping in their guns to get quick cash for drugs.
[00:16:26.384 --> 00:16:29.946]  Drug dealers bringing guns in they stole to get more drugs.
[00:16:31.347 --> 00:16:46.356]  The news uses it as an image to show the pictures, the moving images of people lined up, handing their guns in to the police officers, preparing you psychologically to accept that.
[00:16:47.648 --> 00:16:49.330]  By the way, there are government documents on this.
[00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:58.878]  That's why they have thousands of terror drills every year, blowing up buses, blowing up cars, from Belton, Texas to Seattle, Washington to Chicago, Illinois.
[00:16:59.679 --> 00:17:02.481]  I've been to many of these and seen hundreds of others online.
[00:17:03.002 --> 00:17:10.849]  Out in L.A., they'll blow up a couple buses and tell everybody it's a terrorist attack and then announce right after the press conference, no, no, no, it's a drill.
[00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:15.844]  I've been there when mayors get up and say, we were hit by terrorists, over 20 people died.
[00:17:15.864 --> 00:17:22.252]  The police are responding, because, see, the feds tell them, oh, even do a drill with the press conference.
[00:17:22.772 --> 00:17:27.738]  And then the press, the next day, writes in the paper, Belton attacked by terrorists.
[00:17:28.179 --> 00:17:29.240]  Dozens die.
[00:17:29.861 --> 00:17:31.723]  That headline, by the way, is in Road to Tyranny.
[00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:45.089]  And then you even get to see the original press conference, and then after a 10-15 paragraph big article, at the bottom it says, oh, but it was all just a drill to create the psychological perception there are terrorists.
[00:17:45.229 --> 00:17:54.014]  Small towns with bomb squads, and robots, and federal liaisons, and drones, and cameras, all for a bomb threat.
[00:17:54.274 --> 00:17:59.337]  You've got a chance of being struck, you know, twice by lightning, literally, that you do of being killed by a terrorist.
[00:18:00.422 --> 00:18:01.864]  But everything's got to change.
[00:18:02.264 --> 00:18:03.846]  All freedoms have to be given up.
[00:18:05.248 --> 00:18:18.705]  And then now they've announced in the Washington Post, okay, it's true, this came out Sunday, okay, they're using the no warrant, no probable cause, regional
[00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:28.203]  Homeland Security directives, no longer judges, no longer courts, no longer warrants, in non-terror related cases.
[00:18:28.363 --> 00:18:34.804]  Okay, they're using them on drug dealers, and they're using them on gun dealers, and they're using them in non-terror related.
[00:18:35.004 --> 00:18:35.544]  Okay.
[00:18:35.584 --> 00:18:42.486]  And then hundreds of articles about, hey, you know, in West Virginia alone, or in New York.
[00:18:42.546 --> 00:18:45.146]  I mean, there's just been hundreds of these stories we've covered here on air.
[00:18:45.726 --> 00:18:48.087]  Our states use the Patriot Act 3,000 plus times!
[00:18:50.971 --> 00:18:53.253]  I mean, we ought to do a story just researching all those articles.
[00:18:53.293 --> 00:18:57.438]  We've done many where the Patriot Act's been used in non-terror-related cases.
[00:18:58.399 --> 00:18:59.960]  You are the terrorist.
[00:19:00.561 --> 00:19:01.262]  Blackwater.
[00:19:01.482 --> 00:19:04.605]  All of this is to be used on us.
[00:19:05.266 --> 00:19:06.167]  Used on me.
[00:19:06.707 --> 00:19:07.949]  Used on you.
[00:19:08.469 --> 00:19:09.871]  This is the system.
[00:19:10.954 --> 00:19:13.215]  And it's all coming into fruition.
[00:19:13.255 --> 00:19:19.159]  That's why they've got 180,000 full-time contractors, 150,000 part-time subcontractors.
[00:19:19.499 --> 00:19:23.161]  That's why they're announcing they're going to use black water now in the war on drugs domestically.
[00:19:23.461 --> 00:19:26.463]  They got rid of posse commentatus claiming the military was fighting drugs.
[00:19:26.883 --> 00:19:28.844]  Now it's going to be black water on our streets.
[00:19:29.444 --> 00:19:40.870]  And that's why the federal government shipped in tens of billions of dollars a month on pallets of hundred and thousand dollar bills, and gave privates thirty grand, gave even non-commissioned officers a hundred grand.
[00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:41.870]  They're all bought off!
[00:19:43.291 --> 00:19:45.833]  High-level majors and above are getting millions.
[00:19:46.133 --> 00:19:47.473]  They're allowed to bring the cash in.
[00:19:47.493 --> 00:19:48.294]  They're not searched.
[00:19:48.574 --> 00:19:51.655]  Now they're going to convert directly over to mercenary armies.
[00:19:51.956 --> 00:19:53.396]  It's the full conversion!
[00:19:53.636 --> 00:19:56.398]  Destroy our military, then convert it fully!
[00:20:01.922 --> 00:20:05.764]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:07.045]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:20:07.205 --> 00:20:10.787]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:20:11.087 --> 00:20:13.609]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:20:13.989 --> 00:20:15.750]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.372]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:20:19.432 --> 00:20:25.097]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:20:25.137 --> 00:20:27.559]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.041]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:20:37.188 --> 00:20:39.650]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.713]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[00:20:42.733 --> 00:20:43.413]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:20:43.453 --> 00:20:46.155]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[00:20:46.175 --> 00:20:46.816]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.730]  It's a fact.
[00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:09.411]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:21:09.532 --> 00:21:18.413]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:21:18.673 --> 00:21:29.215]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:21:29.475 --> 00:21:35.538]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:21:35.759 --> 00:21:40.781]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:21:40.962 --> 00:21:45.444]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:47.405]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:21:47.465 --> 00:21:47.645]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:21:52.668 --> 00:21:52.929]  We're good.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.682]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN Financial Bulletin.
[00:22:05.002 --> 00:22:10.005]  Have you ever wanted to make a lot of extra cash in a way that requires very little money to get started?
[00:22:10.405 --> 00:22:15.568]  If so, and you have a high-speed internet connection, this may well be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:22:15.788 --> 00:22:16.368]  Here's why.
[00:22:16.569 --> 00:22:24.573]  You can now get a free DVD that reveals how to make more money than any sane person can possibly spend, and do it while working part-time at home.
[00:22:24.693 --> 00:22:25.113]  I think so.
[00:22:44.778 --> 00:22:45.599]  I think so.
[00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:04.093]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:23:04.253 --> 00:23:09.439]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:23:09.779 --> 00:23:15.105]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:23:15.506 --> 00:23:16.587]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:23:16.967 --> 00:23:26.031]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:27.912]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:23:28.132 --> 00:23:36.956]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[00:23:37.356 --> 00:23:39.017]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[00:23:41.198 --> 00:23:41.958]  Keep it natural.
[00:23:42.259 --> 00:23:50.462]  Call CalBin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[00:23:50.682 --> 00:23:54.804]  Try CalBin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[00:23:54.824 --> 00:23:55.904]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:24:14.958 --> 00:24:19.741]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:21.062 --> 00:24:23.104]  Some of the other news that I haven't covered yet.
[00:24:23.124 --> 00:24:33.171]  Glenn Beck confronted protagonist questioned by what we believe are Secret Service, at least that's what the police and different minions at the bookstore were saying.
[00:24:33.551 --> 00:24:40.355]  Ron Paul supporters threatened with arrest for asking CNN host about recent tirade linking them with terrorists.
[00:24:40.375 --> 00:24:43.878]  We do have that video from We Are Change, the great folks there.
[00:24:45.206 --> 00:24:48.087]  Uh, that, uh, confronted him in Cincinnati.
[00:24:48.107 --> 00:24:53.628]  They were polite about it until the police started threatening to arrest him and shoving him every time they would ask questions.
[00:24:54.949 --> 00:24:55.829]  Beck's minions.
[00:24:56.009 --> 00:25:02.951]  See, this is what the whole anti-terror system, this giant juggernaut, they've built up as for.
[00:25:03.091 --> 00:25:07.892]  And now they're saying, hey, we built it to fight Al-Cieda.
[00:25:09.199 --> 00:25:13.122]  But now it's going to be used against the violent Ron Paul people.
[00:25:13.402 --> 00:25:14.322]  They're not violent.
[00:25:14.643 --> 00:25:15.323]  It doesn't matter.
[00:25:15.363 --> 00:25:30.933]  They're just going to say we are, and now have lots of guys with earpieces and suits guarding the politicos, the commissars, the political officers that sit up on television telling us to give up all of our liberties and freedom for the Great Fatherland.
[00:25:32.374 --> 00:25:33.875]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:25:33.895 --> 00:25:38.298]  I also want to be clear about this.
[00:25:41.667 --> 00:25:48.014]  Unfortunately, I'm one of the few people, because I've analyzed what other patriot groups, what other truth groups are putting out.
[00:25:48.975 --> 00:25:52.499]  They all do great work, but many of them don't see the larger picture.
[00:25:53.183 --> 00:26:11.513]  And I've been studying the police-state buildup for so long, government-sponsored tariff for so long, and the world financial system for so long, and I've read so many of their own, Rand Corporation, Council on Foreign Relations, Pentagon, Naval War College plans, I've seen so much of their activities, that I clearly know what their plan is.
[00:26:11.593 --> 00:26:15.355]  But now, I mean, I said what their plan was ten years ago, and I was accurate.
[00:26:16.266 --> 00:26:40.876]  They're going to stage terror, they're going to bring in the police state, they're going to do it incrementally, they're going to get rid of posse comitatus, they're going to train you to accept mercenaries on our streets, they're going to hire illegal aliens, they're going to hire felons, because I saw them moving to do that, and they're going down every historical lesson from every dictatorship going back over 2,000 years, and literally making a list and checking it twice, to ensure that they're doing everything.
[00:26:41.256 --> 00:26:44.538]  And they're moving now very quickly in all of this.
[00:26:46.697 --> 00:26:47.398]  Think about it.
[00:26:47.458 --> 00:26:48.818]  I mean, really let it burn in.
[00:26:48.838 --> 00:26:52.000]  And I'm talking to myself, not just you.
[00:26:52.401 --> 00:26:54.382]  We have to consciously think about this.
[00:26:55.542 --> 00:27:03.707]  The fact that more than 20% of the ground force in Iraq and the Army, and a large percentage of the Marine Corps, are illegal aliens that were legalized.
[00:27:03.827 --> 00:27:06.089]  I mean, that is off-the-charts tyranny right there.
[00:27:06.469 --> 00:27:08.450]  Talk about foreign troops, they are military.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:14.604]  Then think about the fact that they hire aggravated felons who are illegal aliens and who are U.S.
[00:27:14.624 --> 00:27:20.067]  citizens, arsonists, rapists, armed robbers, people who have assaulted with deadly weapons.
[00:27:20.588 --> 00:27:22.689]  I told you that seven years ago when we first learned of it.
[00:27:23.069 --> 00:27:24.971]  Now it's in the major news.
[00:27:25.411 --> 00:27:29.654]  Now they're having debates about, well, should we be hiring aggravated felons?
[00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:30.614]  Maybe so.
[00:27:31.075 --> 00:27:32.536]  They can get the job done.
[00:27:33.056 --> 00:27:35.918]  Hitler, Stalin, Mao, they all did that.
[00:27:36.966 --> 00:27:39.807]  But they didn't hire foreigners who were aggravated felons.
[00:27:39.847 --> 00:27:41.887]  I mean, that's even more incredible.
[00:27:42.387 --> 00:27:47.128]  And then now they convert our military to where there are almost twice as many.
[00:27:47.168 --> 00:27:54.510]  There are 160,000 troops, and there are 320,000 mercenaries, so I guess that is more than double.
[00:27:56.330 --> 00:28:01.111]  So now they have double the number of mercenaries in Iraq, and then they say, oh, guess what?
[00:28:01.781 --> 00:28:09.148]  We phased out a lot of posse commentatas so we can use the troops on you to fight terror and crime and checkpoints.
[00:28:09.668 --> 00:28:23.401]  I mean, I remember eight years ago, Fiesta, Texas, in San Antonio, listeners bringing us video that we aired on local access TV of Air Force military police on the streets of San Antonio.
[00:28:24.401 --> 00:28:26.662]  At Fiesta Texas, but also at the City Fiesta.
[00:28:26.722 --> 00:28:27.303]  They did both.
[00:28:27.883 --> 00:28:30.545]  Walking up and saying, let me see your IDs.
[00:28:30.605 --> 00:28:32.306]  Oh, just checking for underage people.
[00:28:33.667 --> 00:28:35.608]  See, why would they have military police?
[00:28:35.668 --> 00:28:37.769]  Oh, we're just here assisting the police.
[00:28:37.869 --> 00:28:40.110]  No, it's part of a larger program.
[00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:47.755]  And we know that because we've interviewed state police, we've interviewed federal marshals, we've interviewed Marine Corps officers.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:57.726]  It's in Road to Tyranny about how they were in the secret program and they showed me photos and documents and it fit in with then official documents I've seen.
[00:28:59.147 --> 00:29:06.132]  See, creeping, secretly shutting us up, secretly, oh, troops at the Super Bowl, troops at the Kentucky Derby.
[00:29:07.873 --> 00:29:10.375]  Troops to keep you safe everywhere but on the border.
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.761]  You go, wait a minute, they put troops on the border.
[00:29:12.941 --> 00:29:13.381]  No they didn't.
[00:29:13.842 --> 00:29:20.446]  They said they were going to put 6,000 National Guard on and at any one time they put 200 on the border and they weren't allowed to have loaded M16s.
[00:29:22.187 --> 00:29:23.247]  It was for photo ops.
[00:29:23.868 --> 00:29:27.770]  And they built 20 miles of 2,000 miles of fence they were supposedly going to build.
[00:29:29.019 --> 00:29:30.979]  You see, it's about you and your family.
[00:29:31.039 --> 00:29:32.760]  It's about dominating you.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.240]  Caesar has brought his troops into Rome.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.560]  They are now using them against us.
[00:29:38.021 --> 00:29:40.301]  They are now putting cameras in all the schools.
[00:29:40.561 --> 00:29:42.361]  They are training our children how to be prisoners.
[00:29:42.721 --> 00:29:45.982]  We are being eased into hardcore tyranny.
[00:29:46.622 --> 00:29:47.802]  We'll come back into Glenn Beck.
[00:29:47.842 --> 00:29:49.162]  Take your phone calls and a lot more.
[00:29:51.343 --> 00:29:52.383]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.763 --> 00:29:54.383]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.283 --> 00:29:57.964]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.431 --> 00:30:01.911]  Hi, Ken.
[00:30:01.952 --> 00:30:02.732]  It's Judy again.
[00:30:02.752 --> 00:30:07.276]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[00:30:07.436 --> 00:30:10.578]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[00:30:10.798 --> 00:30:12.680]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.022]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[00:30:15.222 --> 00:30:21.306]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[00:30:21.527 --> 00:30:26.811]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:29.933]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[00:30:30.073 --> 00:30:30.994]  Go KenSolar!
[00:30:32.285 --> 00:30:33.806]  Get the best of both worlds.

[00:31:01.175 --> 00:31:02.055]  Storable Food!
[00:31:02.275 --> 00:31:03.136]  Storable Food!
[00:31:03.296 --> 00:31:07.337]  HempUSA.org has an inexpensive, nutritionally dense, high-frequency food.
[00:31:07.497 --> 00:31:16.740]  Hemp, known around the world, will boost your immune system and increase energy levels, detoxifies the body and reduces junk food cravings, burns fat and builds muscle, and is easy to digest.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.220]  I think so.
[00:31:43.533 --> 00:31:48.598]  Remember, vacuum packaging this food will have at least a five-year shelf life stored in a cool, dark, dry place.
[00:31:48.798 --> 00:31:51.941]  Holidays are coming, and this would make a perfect gift for friends and family.
[00:31:52.021 --> 00:31:56.585]  Call today, 908-691-2608 at hempusa.org.
[00:31:56.766 --> 00:32:00.289]  And remember, let your food be your medicine, and your medicine be your food.
[00:32:01.207 --> 00:32:04.648]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:32:04.888 --> 00:32:06.989]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:09.610]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:14.232]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[00:32:14.272 --> 00:32:14.952]  Here's why.
[00:32:15.352 --> 00:32:21.294]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:32:21.514 --> 00:32:27.517]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[00:32:27.757 --> 00:32:28.677]  But they're not cheating.
[00:32:28.917 --> 00:32:32.920]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:37.444]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:32:37.544 --> 00:32:45.049]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:32:45.089 --> 00:32:45.710]  Get control.
[00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:46.491]  Get relief.
[00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:47.251]  Get some sleep.
[00:32:47.371 --> 00:32:50.554]  Go to www.OutIn90.com.
[00:32:50.694 --> 00:32:54.076]  That's www.OutIn90.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:32:54.096 --> 00:32:54.337]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:32:59.771]  That's right.
[00:33:29.056 --> 00:33:33.197]  Now remember two weeks ago when gold started correcting it went up to $837 an ounce
[00:33:59.781 --> 00:34:10.551]  And then it went back down to $790-something, and I said, folks, that's people who are profit-taking, who are dumping gold.
[00:34:11.612 --> 00:34:13.534]  The dollar is going to continue to weaken.
[00:34:14.135 --> 00:34:14.935]  It's unfortunate.
[00:34:14.955 --> 00:34:17.157]  You've heard Ron Paul and every other economic expert.
[00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:20.741]  I'm even a mainstream analyst.
[00:34:20.821 --> 00:34:22.823]  It's going to continue to weaken, unfortunately.
[00:34:22.863 --> 00:34:23.944]  I'm not happy about this.
[00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:30.814]  And once gold starts going back up again, it will then correct.
[00:34:31.335 --> 00:34:32.356]  Who knows if that'll be at $850?
[00:34:32.396 --> 00:34:34.578]  Who knows if that'll be $900 and something?
[00:34:34.618 --> 00:34:35.980]  Who knows if it'll go back down to the $1000?
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.642]  But gold is at less than half what it was in 1980.
[00:34:37.682 --> 00:34:38.603]  You go, wait a minute, it was $850.
[00:34:46.978 --> 00:34:50.000]  $40 an ounce at spot in 1980.
[00:34:50.241 --> 00:34:57.886]  Yes, and that was when dollars had roughly double their purchasing power just 27 years ago.
[00:34:58.947 --> 00:35:00.047]  That's the type of inflation.
[00:35:00.548 --> 00:35:05.131]  And so gold will have to be at over $2,200 an ounce just to be at parity with 1980 numbers.
[00:35:05.151 --> 00:35:07.372]  It is low at $820-something an ounce today.
[00:35:07.432 --> 00:35:07.753]  It is low
[00:35:16.614 --> 00:35:19.295]  And it is only an indicator.
[00:35:19.355 --> 00:35:22.696]  People keep thinking that the Arabs are ripping us off on oil.
[00:35:23.837 --> 00:35:26.418]  No, if you're paying in Euros, oil prices are down.
[00:35:27.618 --> 00:35:34.560]  If you're paying in British Sterling, oil prices are down from just a couple years ago.
[00:35:35.201 --> 00:35:36.401]  It's the dollar.
[00:35:36.921 --> 00:35:41.203]  And the mainstream media won't dare tell you that.
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:49.343]  Now, remember, once a currency is devalued, at the end, it accelerates its descent.
[00:35:49.783 --> 00:35:59.388]  And people think the dollar losing a penny or so every couple of weeks, which is plunging at Mach speed, it's bad, it could plunge even faster.
[00:35:59.508 --> 00:36:12.235]  But if it continues to drop at a cent every few weeks, we're talking about the middle of next year having a dollar that's 15 cents or less on the dollar from what it was just eight years ago.
[00:36:15.566 --> 00:36:22.690]  I mean, really, it's elementary economic... It's elementary.
[00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:24.851]  It's absolutely elementary.
[00:36:25.111 --> 00:36:26.492]  I am freaked out every day.
[00:36:27.833 --> 00:36:38.919]  I'm watching the yuppies go to and fro in the general public, out chasing after Christmas goodies, and I just am... I'm speechless again.
[00:36:38.959 --> 00:36:40.280]  This is actually happening more and more.
[00:36:43.835 --> 00:36:58.899]  If this continues, which every sign shows it is, if it stays the same by the time the public discovers it next year, or maybe even sooner, it could happen tomorrow morning, it could happen a year from now, I don't know, but the economic money is on the middle of next year.
[00:37:00.699 --> 00:37:04.920]  That's the majority of experts, the vast majority, both establishment and anti-establishment.
[00:37:07.901 --> 00:37:08.961]  If this continues,
[00:37:10.462 --> 00:37:16.925]  At current level, it's going to mean a sustained, multi-year, deep recession.
[00:37:17.825 --> 00:37:24.849]  If the problems just stop here, but instead it's eroding, it's deteriorating fast, it's exploding, basically.
[00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:31.712]  If it continues to erode at the pace, it is going to mean a depression.
[00:37:32.748 --> 00:37:35.591]  I don't know how the establishment is going to spend that one.
[00:37:36.111 --> 00:37:45.639]  And if it accelerates its dissent, it is going to be an economic catastrophe that dwarfs anything the modern world has ever seen.
[00:37:45.719 --> 00:37:56.488]  It will make 1929 to 1939, that sustained nine-and-a-half-year depression, look like a Sunday picnic.
[00:37:56.588 --> 00:37:57.769]  And I mean it when I say that.
[00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:59.411]  I am completely freaked out.
[00:38:00.504 --> 00:38:03.425]  But basically, I stay at the helm of the ship broadcasting.
[00:38:03.445 --> 00:38:21.274]  If I was really just cared about myself, folks, I'd be scurrying around selling everything I got, trying to get out on a farm somewhere, trying to get some property, and putting in 10 years of food, and barbed wire fences, and intruder detectors, and... I mean, literally.
[00:38:22.114 --> 00:38:22.654]  Literally.
[00:38:24.935 --> 00:38:26.036]  Oh no.
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.021]  That's why I don't even feel worthy to come on air and talk to you.
[00:38:31.201 --> 00:38:33.802]  I'm not the person to disclose all this to you.
[00:38:34.042 --> 00:38:37.363]  Why I'm one of the few people that fully grasp it, I'll never know.
[00:38:37.383 --> 00:38:46.227]  But my intellect, my skills of oratory, which people think are great, are really nothing.
[00:38:46.787 --> 00:38:57.511]  I just... To watch the globalists set all this up, make no mistake, they designed it, they bragged about it in their own words, they penned it, they are the authors of it,
[00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:27.402]  And to know that they are going to pose as saviors throughout this unraveling, and to know that we're going to have to watch their minions, the Limbaughs, the Becks, the Savages of the world, and the Hilaries, to know we're going to see the Democrats and Republicans circle the wagons they already have and wage war against the people,
[00:39:28.371 --> 00:39:32.974]  And to know the hard times we've got coming just absolutely enrages me at the same time.
[00:39:33.974 --> 00:39:35.015]  It really upsets me.
[00:39:35.395 --> 00:39:40.238]  Now I also start feeling sorry for myself, I'll be honest with you, because I've got stuff I want to do.
[00:39:40.618 --> 00:39:54.026]  I mean, I've said it, I've got... I want to go to Monument Valley, Utah where I've been before and rock climb and have campfires and hike around and, you know, pull out a watercolor sketchbook and watercolor and
[00:39:55.251 --> 00:39:57.532]  You know, I play cowboys and Indians with my children.
[00:39:57.592 --> 00:39:59.152]  I want to go deep sea fishing.
[00:39:59.712 --> 00:40:01.193]  I want to go camping.
[00:40:01.273 --> 00:40:02.353]  I want to go hiking.
[00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:05.214]  I want to go water skiing.
[00:40:05.234 --> 00:40:10.895]  I want to go lift weights two hours a day and get back in the shape I was many years ago.
[00:40:11.436 --> 00:40:15.357]  But I just can't stop working 12-14 hours a day.
[00:40:15.417 --> 00:40:16.157]  I have cut back.
[00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:24.555]  Because I know that we're having effect against the globalists and I know that we literally have no future if we don't at least stall them.
[00:40:25.195 --> 00:40:33.801]  All we can hope for is to stall them and discredit them so this system kind of grinds to a halt like the Soviet Union in its latter days.
[00:40:35.122 --> 00:40:45.449]  That's the best we can hope for is a horrible extended recession with lingering police state activities but a system that loses all credibility and kind of just breaks down.
[00:40:46.275 --> 00:40:49.017]  And it'll still be like a giant dead elephant sitting on us.
[00:40:49.317 --> 00:40:50.097]  It's gonna be bad.
[00:40:50.638 --> 00:40:55.801]  Instead of a huge enraged elephant on PCP running over us with its tusk.
[00:41:00.444 --> 00:41:04.466]  I mean, how do I even... Again, I really can't even do news anymore.
[00:41:04.526 --> 00:41:08.929]  I can't even just normally be a radio host because that lessens how serious it is.
[00:41:11.889 --> 00:41:13.710]  I'm actually dumbfounded right now.
[00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:29.962]  You know, in the past, I would get on air, and when I really turned my brain on and really got focused in on the news and the analysis, I would be intellectually covering the information, but also at a subconscious level feel very threatened and upset, and would become enraged on air and start yelling and screaming.
[00:41:30.382 --> 00:41:35.526]  And while that's entertaining, I want you to know that that was never an act.
[00:41:35.926 --> 00:41:40.770]  Right now, I'm far beyond even becoming enraged and yelling and screaming.
[00:41:41.787 --> 00:41:44.368]  I'm actually catching my breath right now on air.
[00:41:44.388 --> 00:41:49.030]  I wouldn't even call it an anxiety attack I'm having, but that's what it's closely akin to.
[00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:53.752]  I'm just here trying to tell you we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:41:54.272 --> 00:41:55.613]  All of us are in a lot of trouble.
[00:41:56.173 --> 00:41:57.033]  This is serious.
[00:41:57.113 --> 00:41:59.854]  I mean, I wish America wasn't run by evil people.
[00:42:00.274 --> 00:42:07.197]  I wish they hadn't done tens of thousands of tests, killing foster children and murdering our own troops and doing every evil you can imagine.
[00:42:07.557 --> 00:42:08.958]  That's just the stuff we know about.
[00:42:09.711 --> 00:42:11.532]  I wish they weren't debasing our dollar.
[00:42:11.592 --> 00:42:19.715]  I wish they weren't planning to use mercenaries domestically against us and illegal alien felons.
[00:42:20.155 --> 00:42:21.575]  How did we get to that?
[00:42:22.136 --> 00:42:29.258]  Thousands of people told us the law they gotta take shots, cops trying to force their way into houses to search for guns without warrants.
[00:42:31.579 --> 00:42:34.840]  At a certain point I'm like, how does the general public not see this?
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.881]  How does the general public not know?
[00:42:36.901 --> 00:42:39.282]  And then I feel sorry for myself, I think.
[00:42:40.114 --> 00:42:42.955]  Man, I, every day above ground is a good day.
[00:42:43.515 --> 00:42:45.075]  Every day I'm not in some dungeon.
[00:42:45.155 --> 00:42:46.495]  Every day I'm not dead.
[00:42:47.075 --> 00:42:49.136]  Every day I'm not double-tapped.
[00:42:49.896 --> 00:42:53.536]  And then I, at a certain level, don't even hate those that would come and double-tap me.
[00:42:53.576 --> 00:43:03.378]  They're just guys with tattoos who love the fact that they can do a hundred pull-ups and, you know, got recruited out of Special Ops because they answered the questionnaires and showed they were psychopathic.
[00:43:03.438 --> 00:43:05.358]  And they're just not even really human.
[00:43:05.418 --> 00:43:08.779]  They're just damaged people who like to kill and like to
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:17.827]  You know, run around and party and, you know, like the money they get, and it's just... And then I think about all the evil people who work in the system.
[00:43:17.867 --> 00:43:25.253]  Most of them are compartmentalized pieces of it, and they just do things for greed and don't see in the larger tapestry what they're causing.
[00:43:29.376 --> 00:43:33.540]  And I think, I think, man, okay, uh, so what?
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.021]  People know my name.
[00:43:38.203 --> 00:43:39.924]  That doesn't do anything for you at the end of the day.
[00:43:39.964 --> 00:43:40.885]  In fact, it's annoying.
[00:43:42.466 --> 00:43:44.648]  The novelty of it wears off real fast.
[00:43:46.789 --> 00:43:49.711]  Then I look at my family and I think of the danger I put them in.
[00:43:49.731 --> 00:43:57.356]  I consciously have done it, but I think about the danger and I think about all the decisions I've made.
[00:43:57.396 --> 00:44:06.503]  At the end of the day, I'm able to do it and able to continue and able to get past any lingering concerns or what you could call fears.
[00:44:07.679 --> 00:44:09.380]  But it's more like a distant memory now.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.341]  I'm almost nostalgic for fear I had 10, 12 years ago.
[00:44:17.102 --> 00:44:22.023]  And I realize that somebody has got to stand up for New York foster children.
[00:44:22.624 --> 00:44:30.946]  This is just one place where it's been in mainstream news, so I'd mention it, where they take the little black children predominantly, but they take Puerto Rican and white too.
[00:44:31.907 --> 00:44:33.347]  And they take them and they murder them.
[00:44:34.452 --> 00:44:39.314]  They give them pesticide till they die, or they test drugs on them till they die, healthy children.
[00:44:39.794 --> 00:44:44.656]  Think about them in those cold dormitories, in those locked up little cells.
[00:44:47.037 --> 00:44:48.298]  Think about how they murdered them.
[00:44:50.379 --> 00:45:02.824]  And then it really comes to mind, it comes to heart, it comes to my very core, that whatever has to happen, whatever happens to me, whatever happens to my family,
[00:45:03.935 --> 00:45:07.316]  Somebody has got to stand up and fight this evil.
[00:45:07.356 --> 00:45:10.417]  This evil wouldn't be growing as fast as it is.
[00:45:10.537 --> 00:45:11.877]  It wouldn't be taking over.
[00:45:12.237 --> 00:45:28.722]  It wouldn't be making its move if it didn't think the public was dumbed down and unable to complete a sentence, or unable to find the country on a map, or unable to talk about the three branches of government, much less who their congressman is.
[00:45:34.582 --> 00:45:38.846]  But they've made their move now, and it has woken up a lot of people, so now they're concerned.
[00:45:39.968 --> 00:45:41.469]  And I went right down the line.
[00:45:41.749 --> 00:45:53.101]  I said that they would go into Iraq and be there for many years, and that four or five years after they got in, they would then merge our troops with mercenaries and then bring them back home to run domestic operations.
[00:45:53.161 --> 00:45:53.802]  And I said that
[00:45:54.716 --> 00:46:06.808]  When they started putting out the talking point that people who were against the Patriot Act and the police state were keeping the government from keeping us safe from Al-Qaeda, that that was a key indicator they were getting ready to stage terror attacks.
[00:46:07.108 --> 00:46:16.177]  And then when they started to openly say that Patriot groups, Libertarian groups, anti-war groups worked for terrorists, that that was one of the final signs.
[00:46:17.958 --> 00:46:19.960]  And now they've done what I told you they would do.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:29.747]  They've been quietly using it all against the American people, but now they're publicly, in a declarative announcement, they are saying it.
[00:46:32.469 --> 00:46:34.351]  They are announcing it.
[00:46:36.413 --> 00:46:37.914]  They are doing it.
[00:46:47.117 --> 00:46:57.960]  And I look at very wicked, worldly... I mean, we're really seeing the types of people that led Germany into what happened there.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.102]  We're literally witnessing the types of talk show hosts that led Russia into what happened there.
[00:47:03.162 --> 00:47:15.366]  We're literally witnessing people who are openly calling for the arrest and tasering and beating of patriots and anti-war and Ron Paul supporters and libertarians.
[00:47:16.371 --> 00:47:26.895]  We're openly seeing them say, let's use the military against the American people, and that means the military made up of illegal alien felons and mercenaries from Blackwater.
[00:47:29.856 --> 00:47:32.037]  An executive outcome, and all the other groups.
[00:47:35.578 --> 00:47:37.539]  I mean, this, is it me saying it?
[00:47:38.389 --> 00:47:44.612]  I saw the attack pattern, I saw history, and I saw their own documents, so I knew what they were planning.
[00:47:44.993 --> 00:47:58.619]  But to see them walk the line, to see them execute and dot every I and cross every T, that means they're going to do everything else they said they were going to do that's coming.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:07.684]  That means nukes going off in cities, that means engineered plagues, that means hell on earth.
[00:48:11.408 --> 00:48:27.846]  That means milling scared crowds and families being broken up and 26,000 preachers in the pulpits telling their members to go to the camps and to let their families be broken up and let the mercury be injected into them and the rest of it.
[00:48:30.228 --> 00:48:33.532]  I remember seeing footage of Marines training
[00:48:34.289 --> 00:48:43.356]  With role players, not Urban Warrior I went to, or Heber & Maryland, we got footage of, or Swansboro, North Carolina, but other footage I was shown but not allowed to air.
[00:48:45.178 --> 00:48:49.701]  The contractors who shot the video from on top of the military base, they were re-roofing.
[00:48:52.364 --> 00:48:54.665]  This was 8 years ago, wouldn't let me show it.
[00:48:56.087 --> 00:49:02.672]  And it was Marines training to mow down hundreds of role players holding up signs saying, don't take our farms.
[00:49:04.429 --> 00:49:16.734]  And the troops moved out Humvees with heavy machine guns and they practiced over and over again mowing the citizens down.
[00:49:18.814 --> 00:49:25.477]  Mowing us down, murdering us, killing us, right out of the pit of hell.
[00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:31.159]  And then you find out that the very same globalist
[00:49:32.668 --> 00:49:47.557]  That re-engineered Russia, and China, and Germany, and countries in Africa, and Latin America, who have fomented and hired the death squads in a hundred plus nations, and who will use the U.S.
[00:49:47.597 --> 00:49:51.780]  as their funding bank, are now coming here to do it.
[00:49:55.682 --> 00:50:02.086]  They are bloodthirstily coming for all of us.
[00:50:03.524 --> 00:50:10.988]  And so I don't even get mad or enraged at Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly and the rest of them talking about how we all need to be arrested.
[00:50:12.328 --> 00:50:13.429]  I don't even get mad anymore.
[00:50:13.529 --> 00:50:19.972]  I just see them just like a Mack truck and I'm standing in the middle of the street and it's coming on to run me over.
[00:50:20.032 --> 00:50:21.072]  That's all I see it as.
[00:50:21.813 --> 00:50:28.976]  And I just see them as pathetic, weak, sold out, very, very wicked, evil people.
[00:50:30.276 --> 00:50:31.237]  Very intelligent.
[00:50:32.017 --> 00:50:36.458]  Using all their skills to empower this dark force.
[00:50:38.498 --> 00:50:49.421]  A dark force that conservatively killed 200 million people in the 20th century.
[00:50:52.041 --> 00:50:53.121]  What are we supposed to do?
[00:50:53.141 --> 00:50:53.682]  I don't know.
[00:50:53.762 --> 00:50:55.562]  I'm asking you, what do we do?
[00:50:56.622 --> 00:50:57.502]  What do we do?
[00:50:58.222 --> 00:51:00.443]  I've warned you and now it's happening.
[00:51:01.781 --> 00:51:03.202]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.222 --> 00:51:05.303]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.023 --> 00:51:10.125]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:10.145 --> 00:51:13.066]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:13.746 --> 00:51:15.987]  Don't their objectives mean world domination?
[00:51:16.528 --> 00:51:18.989]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:19.709 --> 00:51:27.052]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.057 --> 00:51:35.020]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.501 --> 00:51:39.003]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.363 --> 00:51:41.885]  Bill Burgess makes big progress for the world, doesn't he?
[00:51:41.945 --> 00:51:43.086]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.106 --> 00:51:43.826]  They're not after money.
[00:51:43.846 --> 00:51:44.967]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.167 --> 00:51:45.888]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.148 --> 00:51:47.289]  That's what they're after, you see.

[00:54:09.894 --> 00:54:21.668]  I was sittin' in traffic, listenin' to the radio George Strait was singin' the seashores of old Mexico
[00:54:25.232 --> 00:54:42.188]  Did the public think that they could just go to sleep and forget how government worked and get disconnected from it all and that freedom would follow?
[00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:45.471]  No, great tyranny followed.
[00:54:46.801 --> 00:54:48.022]  And they're now making their move.
[00:54:48.522 --> 00:54:54.124]  The good news is, they are being discredited, they are being exposed, and they don't like it one bit.
[00:54:54.625 --> 00:54:56.105]  That is the really good news.
[00:54:56.145 --> 00:55:01.388]  The problem is, they show every sign of discontinuing, come hell or high water.
[00:55:01.428 --> 00:55:05.130]  They've realized that if they don't continue, they will begin imploding.
[00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:12.633]  But I've looked at the evidence and the facts and the history, if they do continue, they're even in greater danger of imploding even more.
[00:55:13.337 --> 00:55:15.118]  Alright, I said I'd take calls and I want to.
[00:55:15.518 --> 00:55:17.439]  Mike in Indiana, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:55:17.459 --> 00:55:26.083]  Hey Alex, I'm just mainly calling regarding Glenn Beck and the videos that We Are Change have posted this morning.
[00:55:27.383 --> 00:55:30.165]  Absolutely, we've got a story up on PrisonPlanet.com that's got him.
[00:55:30.525 --> 00:55:34.006]  Beck confronted protagonist question by Secret Service.
[00:55:34.026 --> 00:55:35.647]  We're going to be playing those later in the next hour.
[00:55:36.407 --> 00:55:42.070]  Yeah, I think this points out a real good thing, especially the one about when Beck makes comment of saying that
[00:55:42.563 --> 00:55:44.544]  He loved to have Ron Paul up for an hour.
[00:55:44.564 --> 00:55:53.846]  You know, this guy is a syndicated radio show exome on CNN, but yet he says that they've tried several times, never did.
[00:55:53.866 --> 00:56:03.289]  You know, if this guy has so much, you know, coverage, you'd think that he'd want to get a presidential candidate on instead of kind of passing the buck, which is what he's done.
[00:56:03.429 --> 00:56:09.451]  Well, I have heard from the Paul campaign that they've agreed to come on, but that Beck always says he wants to do it and then doesn't schedule it.
[00:56:10.547 --> 00:56:13.390]  Yeah, I definitely saw that it was a way... Look, it doesn't matter.
[00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:16.132]  The guy's only got like a million and a half viewers on TV.
[00:56:16.492 --> 00:56:22.077]  The point is, it's an illustration of how they want to start arresting us, locking us up, and just saying we're violent.
[00:56:22.658 --> 00:56:26.381]  Again, they just lie and say we're violent, and then call for violence against us.
[00:56:26.921 --> 00:56:34.207]  Exactly, and then on the second video that they posted, the one where they actually talked about his security detail, it's definitely interesting for a book signing.
[00:56:34.227 --> 00:56:35.889]  They had as much security as they did.
[00:56:36.525 --> 00:56:38.886]  And just kind of, you know, a word to everybody out there.
[00:56:38.926 --> 00:56:41.327]  The wicked fleeth when none pursueth.
[00:56:41.387 --> 00:56:42.767]  It's about intimidation.
[00:56:42.827 --> 00:56:45.608]  It's people come and ask him questions.
[00:56:45.648 --> 00:56:48.309]  We better have armed thugs in suits with guns.
[00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:49.929]  It's so evil.
[00:56:49.949 --> 00:56:51.390]  We better have a bunch of police.
[00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:54.531]  I mean, I mean, he's got about 100 people there signing.
[00:56:54.551 --> 00:56:55.471]  I would have had more.
[00:56:55.491 --> 00:56:57.892]  He's in this big, ugly Glenn Beck bus.
[00:56:58.232 --> 00:56:59.472]  The guy's a pathetic joke.
[00:57:00.152 --> 00:57:00.632]  Exactly.
[00:57:00.652 --> 00:57:05.434]  I just, you know, for any of the Ron Paul supporters out there, you know, definitely show, you know, your support.
[00:57:06.127 --> 00:57:17.312]  You know, that second video was kind of on the verge that we almost took Ron Paul's name and, you know, connected it to something that might have been a little iffy, which, you know, of course the media could spin and, you know, use that as against him.
[00:57:17.692 --> 00:57:18.973]  So, you know, we just need to be careful.
[00:57:18.993 --> 00:57:23.835]  Well, number one, we can't do everything, and I appreciate your call, according to what the media might do.
[00:57:24.255 --> 00:57:28.237]  They're going to spin, and they're going to lie, and they're going to put propaganda out.
[00:57:28.297 --> 00:57:34.180]  And if we keep living according to what will they say, what will they do, how will they respond,
[00:57:35.655 --> 00:57:41.278]  They're going to continue to play all sorts of dirty tricks, so it's key to not hesitate.
[00:57:42.318 --> 00:57:45.440]  I mean, they want you off balance and apologetic in everything you do.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.901]  They did a great job at We Are Change.
[00:57:47.921 --> 00:57:50.262]  We're going to be playing the audio of that a little bit later.
[00:57:50.622 --> 00:57:52.403]  John, how many Glenn Beck clips do you have?
[00:57:54.745 --> 00:57:56.165]  Okay, go to WeAreChange.org.
[00:57:56.185 --> 00:57:59.627]  They're also in the story, Glenn Beck confronted, protagonist questioned by Secret Service.
[00:58:00.331 --> 00:58:06.094]  Go make sure the other clips, the one where they talk about the security and show the security, I want to play that coming up in the next hour or two.
[00:58:07.094 --> 00:58:09.295]  It isn't about that sniveling little wimp.
[00:58:09.315 --> 00:58:15.138]  I mean, he comes off as an effeminate wimp, and he just got a $50 million contract, folks.
[00:58:15.858 --> 00:58:16.619]  Why did he get that?
[00:58:16.639 --> 00:58:18.820]  Because he's the heir apparent to Limbaugh.
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.561]  Because I don't know how long Limbaugh can go.
[00:58:20.581 --> 00:58:22.562]  He's so drugged out and so unhealthy.
[00:58:22.982 --> 00:58:25.483]  And, you know, he's on vacation half the time.

[00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:02.550]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.311 --> 00:59:04.212]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.872 --> 00:59:08.515]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.055 --> 00:59:13.179]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.201 --> 00:59:20.264]  I've been talking about this off and on the last week and a half, and it's because it's serious.
[00:59:23.098 --> 00:59:33.543]  We have mainstream media talking points saying that people that disagree with the war and the government are working with terrorists and need to have the military used against them, need to be beaten to pulp, and Taser.
[00:59:33.983 --> 00:59:34.903]  Four put in camps.
[00:59:35.264 --> 00:59:47.029]  The government's hired preachers, 13,000, and they doubled that to 26,000, to tell their flocks secretly, that is, they're not telling them they've been hired, to submit to government forced inoculations, camps, gun confiscation.
[00:59:47.549 --> 00:59:50.311]  We told you all this when it was secret, now it's mainstream news.
[00:59:50.891 --> 00:59:52.192]  It's happening, folks!
[00:59:52.212 --> 00:59:53.532]  They're making their move!
[00:59:54.653 --> 00:59:59.115]  The Pentagon, owned and run by the big foreign banks, is making a move on America!
[00:59:59.515 --> 01:00:08.240]  You always hear about third world countries, or Pakistan, or Guatemala, or Germany, first world nations, where the military, with a dictator, tries to take over.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.240]  Well, this is the system.
[01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:11.882]  So they try to fool you with a Hillary, or a
[01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:19.539]  Bush or a Clinton, but other than that, that's the only thing about it that isn't dictatorship is that they put different puppets in.
[01:00:21.079 --> 01:00:22.199]  Let's continue with your calls.
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.740]  We've got some mini guests coming up.
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:28.022]  They're trying to get guns back on campus so that they're not victim disarmament zones.
[01:00:28.042 --> 01:00:28.642]  That's coming up.
[01:00:29.062 --> 01:00:30.503]  Steve in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:31.183]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:00:31.823 --> 01:00:32.643]  Yes, hello Alex.
[01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:36.985]  Okay, I was over at the Glenn Beck book signing over here in Akron.
[01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:39.683]  And there were about 500 people there.
[01:00:39.743 --> 01:00:40.443]  They bought the books.
[01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:42.144]  I didn't want to buy a book.
[01:00:42.184 --> 01:00:43.605]  I wouldn't give this guy any money at all.
[01:00:44.325 --> 01:00:45.606]  You couldn't ask him any questions.
[01:00:45.646 --> 01:00:46.746]  There was a lot of security.
[01:00:47.767 --> 01:01:02.554]  I noticed that, I mean, not just the few We Are Change people that asked him serious questions would get brushed off, but others would just... I mean, they had guys acting like attack dogs, like, in Beck's eyes, he was looking at the crowd like he hated him.
[01:01:02.834 --> 01:01:04.595]  He's very predatory.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:05.340]  Oh yeah.
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:10.602]  As a matter of fact, they had the security walking up and down the lines as it was leading its way through the bookstore.
[01:01:11.083 --> 01:01:20.827]  Now also, there was a group of, a Ron Paul meet-up group, one of the people here, took one of Ron Paul's books, A Foreign Policy of Freedom, and put it in front of Beck, and he signed it.
[01:01:21.147 --> 01:01:26.390]  And by the way, that's now being auctioned on eBay, and the proceeds will go to Ron Paul.
[01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:27.190]  Right.
[01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:33.793]  Now, there's also an attempt to sort of besmirch Dr. Paul by linking him with Dennis Kucinich.
[01:01:35.463 --> 01:01:43.166]  Yes, I've seen Dennis Kucinich's wife come out and say that he'd be happy to talk to him about running together.
[01:01:43.446 --> 01:01:44.626]  Ron Paul would never do that.
[01:01:44.646 --> 01:01:47.567]  Kucinich is for handgun bans and for socialism.
[01:01:48.307 --> 01:01:49.547]  Right, right.
[01:01:50.448 --> 01:01:52.869]  But they're trying their darndest to get that in front of people.
[01:01:52.889 --> 01:01:55.989]  They're talking about it all over northern Ohio here on all the talk shows.
[01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:56.650]  No, I know.
[01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:58.990]  And it's part of a disinfo deal.
[01:01:59.311 --> 01:02:00.531]  There are so many dirty tricks.
[01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:03.952]  Now, is it just me from these videos?
[01:02:05.195 --> 01:02:08.516]  Or does Glenn Beck look like he hates everyone?
[01:02:08.576 --> 01:02:09.357]  I was looking at him.
[01:02:09.657 --> 01:02:11.237]  He has the look of a beast.
[01:02:12.318 --> 01:02:12.738]  He does.
[01:02:13.298 --> 01:02:13.958]  He's kind of tall.
[01:02:13.998 --> 01:02:15.939]  He's about 6'1", 6'2".
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.340]  Very kind of intimidating if you look at him.
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:25.923]  I mean, he has the look of, like, I don't care, I got mine and you people can all just go away.
[01:02:26.763 --> 01:02:29.024]  And that's the attitude that he had at the book signings.
[01:02:31.969 --> 01:02:36.172]  Well, the establishment likes him, and he's a very wicked, wicked man.
[01:02:36.192 --> 01:02:38.294]  You know, he tried for a few years to build his cred.
[01:02:38.314 --> 01:02:42.017]  I remember, like, four years ago, the whole industry was just pushing him, pushing him.
[01:02:42.037 --> 01:02:43.798]  And I looked at his ratings, they weren't even that good.
[01:02:44.679 --> 01:02:46.740]  And then it's clear he's heir apparent to Limbaugh.
[01:02:47.701 --> 01:02:50.803]  And he's just a horrible, horrible person.
[01:02:50.904 --> 01:02:51.544]  Very evil.
[01:02:52.245 --> 01:02:56.888]  Yeah, you can tell just by his... just by his demeanor.
[01:02:57.308 --> 01:03:00.571]  Now, you know, Tom DeLay is also saying that Hillary is going to be the next president.
[01:03:01.391 --> 01:03:03.693]  Yeah, and so is, of course, Newt Gingrich.
[01:03:04.153 --> 01:03:09.798]  The defense contractors have given more money to her than all Democrats combined, more than Republicans have stacked against them.
[01:03:10.579 --> 01:03:18.885]  Bush is appointing all these... In fact, Hillary got confronted in Ohio over the weekend on this.
[01:03:19.626 --> 01:03:22.308]  She got heckled over the fact that she's in bed with Murdoch.
[01:03:22.548 --> 01:03:25.551]  It was in the New York Times, so people were starting to pay attention.
[01:03:26.986 --> 01:03:27.406]  Sure are.
[01:03:28.007 --> 01:03:28.867]  Good to hear from you.
[01:03:29.307 --> 01:03:31.549]  Did Beck look upset when people were talking to him?
[01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:42.776]  No, he didn't, but he really... He was very standoffish and he wouldn't personalize anything and he was very... You could tell this guy was sort of uneasy.
[01:03:43.456 --> 01:03:44.217]  Yeah, he's a pig.
[01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:48.079]  I mean, this guy would sit up there while we're going to death camps and charities.
[01:03:48.099 --> 01:03:49.780]  He's already said he has the military against us.
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:51.741]  He wants to destroy America.
[01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:54.563]  It is a big idea
[01:03:55.715 --> 01:03:56.776]  A New World Order!
[01:03:57.497 --> 01:04:01.720]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.142]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[01:04:04.342 --> 01:04:07.465]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[01:04:08.005 --> 01:04:10.447]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:11.188 --> 01:04:18.533]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:21.531 --> 01:04:26.514]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:26.975 --> 01:04:30.477]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:30.837 --> 01:04:33.359]  Bill Burgess makes great progress in order world government.
[01:04:33.399 --> 01:04:34.560]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:35.340]  They're not after money.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.421]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:36.641 --> 01:04:37.382]  They're after power.
[01:04:37.622 --> 01:04:38.643]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:06:14.377 --> 01:06:14.997]  I don't think so.

[01:06:41.573 --> 01:06:43.075]  Where your personal security and well-being is our goal.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:59.987]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:00.607 --> 01:07:03.591]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:16.494 --> 01:07:35.426]  Look, I don't want to make this whole show about Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck and these type people, but when they start saying, Ron Paul supporters, they think they're dangerous, they might do something bad, they might be terrorists, we better do something about them, we need to use the military against them, they're aiding Al-Qaeda, that is as un-American as you can get.
[01:07:35.466 --> 01:07:41.930]  But it's not just un-American, it is attacking free speech, it's saying, let's have martial law, let's arrest people.
[01:07:43.531 --> 01:07:45.472]  And he said by name, he said, I'm dangerous.
[01:07:46.684 --> 01:07:47.004]  Okay?
[01:07:47.104 --> 01:07:55.128]  I mean, this guy is trying to create a climate where Alex Jones gets drug off and beaten to a pulp and put in a jail cell to never see my family again.
[01:07:56.848 --> 01:07:57.889]  And I don't even hate him.
[01:07:58.029 --> 01:07:58.609]  I look at him.
[01:07:58.669 --> 01:07:59.750]  He's so worldly.
[01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:01.410]  He loves power.
[01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:02.811]  He loves crowds of people.
[01:08:03.191 --> 01:08:04.171]  He loves money.
[01:08:05.312 --> 01:08:06.452]  He loves being a winner.
[01:08:07.413 --> 01:08:09.354]  And most people you meet in life are like that.
[01:08:09.414 --> 01:08:10.294]  They're social climbers.
[01:08:10.334 --> 01:08:15.096]  They do whatever it takes to be in with the power, to be in with the in crowd, no matter what the in crowd's doing.
[01:08:17.142 --> 01:08:18.383]  And the system is desperate.
[01:08:19.423 --> 01:08:21.545]  And by the way, Beck, you've taken the wrong position.
[01:08:21.705 --> 01:08:23.486]  You're going to be unpopular for what you've done.
[01:08:23.526 --> 01:08:24.487]  You're going to be hated now.
[01:08:24.507 --> 01:08:30.791]  And it's very important that we explain to everybody that he'll talk about the NAU, but then tell us Bush is good.
[01:08:30.831 --> 01:08:33.232]  He'll talk about borders, but then whitewash it.
[01:08:34.433 --> 01:08:37.555]  And all of them, all of these people are horrible demons.
[01:08:39.955 --> 01:08:41.315]  This country's in so much trouble.
[01:08:41.355 --> 01:08:47.837]  Now, shifting gears, I'm going to get back to Steve and Mark and Richard here, but we're going to have our guests for about 15 minutes, and I appreciate them coming on.
[01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:50.077]  They're Scott Lewis and Mike Guzman.
[01:08:51.037 --> 01:09:00.199]  Theconcealedcampus.org, it made AP, it made Houston Chronicle, just all over the place.
[01:09:00.279 --> 01:09:04.260]  Should college students carry guns?
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:08.361]  8,000 members of a national group started and didn't say it's a good idea.
[01:09:10.091 --> 01:09:21.100]  Started right here in Texas, and now they're taking action and having demonstrations down at the University just south of Austin in San Marcos.
[01:09:22.481 --> 01:09:33.970]  And the point is that we have many cases around the world where a shooter comes into a public school, a grade school, or a college, and a professor or a student gets their gun and guns them down or disarms them.
[01:09:34.824 --> 01:09:38.465]  Or you can have Blacksburg, where for three and a half hours the police stand down.
[01:09:38.585 --> 01:09:39.145]  That's admitted.
[01:09:39.606 --> 01:09:42.006]  Or Columbine, four hours and fifteen minutes.
[01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:43.167]  That's the exact time.
[01:09:43.627 --> 01:09:49.069]  Years ago, I had the Rocky Mountain News editor, head editor on, and I said, over three hours.
[01:09:49.089 --> 01:09:50.329]  He said, over three hours, Alex.
[01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:53.450]  It was four hours and fifteen minutes they were ordered to stand down.
[01:09:54.991 --> 01:10:01.973]  What would happen if the teachers, and they didn't have to all do it, a few that are trained and sign on to have instant access pistol safes,
[01:10:03.419 --> 01:10:11.542]  What would happen if the principal, assistant principal, football coaches, whatever... Let's say 10% of the faculty was armed.
[01:10:11.562 --> 01:10:14.583]  What would happen on colleges, in their dormitories, or in their houses?
[01:10:15.343 --> 01:10:19.704]  People have houses on campus and they're not allowed to have guns in there to protect themselves.
[01:10:20.404 --> 01:10:22.045]  The answer is more guns, not less.
[01:10:22.065 --> 01:10:23.545]  That's just common sense in effect.
[01:10:23.985 --> 01:10:28.487]  And I salute the men that we have on that started this organization and are taking action.
[01:10:28.787 --> 01:10:30.708]  Scott Lewis and Mike Guzman.
[01:10:30.788 --> 01:10:31.788]  Gentlemen, thanks for coming on.
[01:10:32.954 --> 01:10:33.955]  Well, thank you for having us, Alex.
[01:10:34.315 --> 01:10:35.176]  Is this Scott or Mike?
[01:10:35.196 --> 01:10:36.077]  This is Scott.
[01:10:36.838 --> 01:10:37.198]  And Mike?
[01:10:38.239 --> 01:10:38.679]  Yes, I'm here.
[01:10:38.819 --> 01:10:39.480]  Thank you for coming on.
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:42.762]  Tell me both who you are, how this got started, how it grew so fast.
[01:10:44.364 --> 01:10:45.605]  Well, this is Scott.
[01:10:45.785 --> 01:10:49.128]  I am the media coordinator for Students for Concealed Carry on campus.
[01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:55.955]  And basically the organization got started last spring as a direct result of the Virginia Tech massacre.
[01:10:55.975 --> 01:11:09.547]  Our founder Chris Brown, who is a student, a political science student at the University of North Texas, he basically said enough is enough and as you know this is, these gun-free zones are the type of issue that have
[01:11:10.407 --> 01:11:12.728]  Erked concealed handgun license holders for years.
[01:11:12.788 --> 01:11:16.489]  We've talked about it in online message boards, in newsgroups, that sort of thing.
[01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:22.730]  And just, it took a tragedy like this to really rally so many like-minded people to this cause.
[01:11:25.971 --> 01:11:28.412]  Mr. Guzman, exactly what do you do with the organization?
[01:11:29.552 --> 01:11:31.573]  Well, I run a chapter out of Texas State.
[01:11:32.093 --> 01:11:36.234]  I'm a former Marine, and I signed on right after the Virginia Tech massacre as well.
[01:11:36.852 --> 01:11:44.899]  And one thing I want to point out, it's not just that we're concerned about some gunman that comes into school, but it's also to prevent rapes, assaults.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:49.423]  Just last week at Texas State, we had one student robbed at gunpoint.
[01:11:49.443 --> 01:11:51.345]  I believe that's the third student this semester.
[01:11:52.146 --> 01:11:54.247]  And also about preventing rapes and sexual assaults.
[01:11:54.648 --> 01:12:00.473]  Here at Texas State, we have eight registered sex offenders living on campus, and 84 in the general community.
[01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:03.776]  And it's not a matter of if they re-offend, but when.
[01:12:04.464 --> 01:12:09.329]  So it's much more than just mass homicide and things of that sort.
[01:12:10.009 --> 01:12:11.371]  Mike, that's a great point.
[01:12:12.011 --> 01:12:24.583]  While the big massacres that happen every few years get the press, there are rapes and single murders happening on campuses, rapes every day, killings every week, and thousands a year, and women
[01:12:25.083 --> 01:12:29.046]  Absolutely, and one of the things that we're trying to make people understand is this is not
[01:12:50.163 --> 01:12:50.923]  I don't know.
[01:13:07.003 --> 01:13:11.764]  To the responsible, law-abiding citizens, we have concealed carry now.
[01:13:11.784 --> 01:13:18.746]  You're wanting them to stop having all these zones that they arbitrarily restrict the Second Amendment in, which according to federal rulings they can't really do.
[01:13:18.786 --> 01:13:21.547]  Explain the basic tenet, what you are pushing for.
[01:13:22.587 --> 01:13:33.730]  Basically, we want to see concealed handgun license holder, concealed carry weapons permit holders have the same rights they enjoy virtually everywhere else extended to them on college campuses.
[01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:35.511]  We do not see any difference between carrying
[01:13:36.169 --> 01:13:42.652]  on a college campus and carrying at a movie theater, an office building, a church, a shopping mall, a bank, etc.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:14:11.665]  Where somebody's car breaks down on a campus when they were making a delivery, they're a concealed carry owner and they're saying because you're on the UT campus, which is a large part of the city, it's happened in Austin, we're going to go ahead and search your car and oh look we found a handgun in your glove compartment, we're going to charge you with these federal felonies and we also need to protect these law-abiding concealed carry holders.
[01:14:12.785 --> 01:14:19.487]  Well absolutely and unfortunately Texas has taken steps to some degree, certainly not to the degree we want, but they have
[01:14:20.385 --> 01:14:24.251]  Uh, past extended domain, which allows people to have guns in their cars, and they have past, uh...
[01:14:25.074 --> 01:14:30.996]  They've amended the law so that you can have a gun on a college campus in Texas, however you cannot have it in any of the buildings.
[01:14:31.536 --> 01:14:38.138]  And of course, that makes it impossible for students and faculty and people like that to carry as part of their daily routine.
[01:14:38.598 --> 01:14:50.522]  And so what we're pushing for is basically what you see in Utah right now, which is a state law that says that tax-subsidized public campuses cannot pass rules that override state law.
[01:14:53.408 --> 01:14:57.411]  Now you've got 8,000 plus members of the Houston Chronicle reports.
[01:14:58.392 --> 01:14:59.633]  You've had demonstrations.
[01:14:59.873 --> 01:15:02.896]  I've read about one down in San Marcos.
[01:15:03.236 --> 01:15:05.978]  Were you at that, Scott?
[01:15:06.038 --> 01:15:08.921]  Mike can tell you more about the San Marcos demonstration they had at that.
[01:15:08.941 --> 01:15:11.523]  We have had demonstrations now on around 125 campuses.
[01:15:11.563 --> 01:15:12.604]  We have currently about 8,800 members.
[01:15:17.029 --> 01:15:26.312]  Well, I'll tell you what's great about this is that instead of letting new gun control laws pass at the federal and state or city level, we need to get gun owners on the offensive.
[01:15:26.832 --> 01:15:41.856]  And you're one of the few groups, Gun Owners of America, GunOwners.org of course is doing this, but when you talk about grassroots organization, you're one of the only groups that's on the offensive calling for more of our rights to be resurrected instead of just fighting new attacks.
[01:15:43.548 --> 01:15:45.771]  And we are seeing support from officials as well.
[01:15:45.872 --> 01:15:52.801]  Governor Perry has stated numerous times that he would sign legislation into law allowing us to carry concealed weapons on the campus.
[01:15:53.162 --> 01:15:56.546]  I've talked to the president of the Texas Fraternal Order of Police, Dennis Ward.
[01:15:56.787 --> 01:15:58.790]  He said he personally would support legislation.
[01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:00.531]  What happens at these demonstrations?
[01:16:00.631 --> 01:16:02.232]  Give me the average breakdown of what develops.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:24.542]  Well, the demonstrations we've been having so far are basically just information campaigns.
[01:16:24.562 --> 01:16:35.809]  We've had students walking around campus wearing t-shirts and empty holsters, basically just to draw attention to the cause, to get people sitting next to them in class or walking past them on campus to say, hey, what's with the holster?
[01:16:35.869 --> 01:16:36.589]  What's with the shirt?
[01:16:37.029 --> 01:16:42.172]  And they carry with them flyers and information handouts and things like that that they can give to anyone who wants to know more about it.
[01:16:42.652 --> 01:16:47.255]  And Mike can tell you more specifically what they did down at Texas State because they went even a little further down there.
[01:16:48.709 --> 01:17:11.143]  Michael, one thing we do is I develop a game where we have four people play the intended victims and we have one just random passer-bys play our game and they picked up a bat and they point the bat at whoever their intended victim is going to be and what I had is I had the victims they all had something behind their back they all had three two or three of them had silly string and one of them would have something like a candy bar
[01:17:11.801 --> 01:17:17.866]  And if they pick the person with the silly string, that was supposed to symbolize someone that was armed, and they would get shot with the silly string.
[01:17:18.146 --> 01:17:24.490]  If you pick the unarmed victim, you obviously have successful mugging, assaults, whatnot, and they got a candy bar.
[01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:25.791]  They got a gift out of it.
[01:17:26.232 --> 01:17:29.374]  And actually, I think a lot of people, their eyes are opened up.
[01:17:29.614 --> 01:17:30.295]  Genius!
[01:17:30.655 --> 01:17:31.255]  Genius!
[01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:31.976]  So easy.
[01:17:33.699 --> 01:17:37.345]  Yeah, the government has drills for knock-and-talk gun confiscation.
[01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:39.428]  They have drills for terror attacks.
[01:17:39.449 --> 01:17:41.071]  The condition is to accept police state.
[01:17:41.352 --> 01:17:43.495]  You guys are doing the opposite of that.
[01:17:43.515 --> 01:17:45.298]  You're having drills that illiberate.
[01:17:46.636 --> 01:17:55.861]  Well, absolutely, and one of the things you hear so often from the gun control advocates is that gun rights groups like ours are unwilling to compromise.
[01:17:56.322 --> 01:18:03.806]  And, of course, their interpretation of compromise is, well, you give us a little bit of your rights now and we'll ask for some more later, but you don't have to give them all up right now.
[01:18:04.706 --> 01:18:12.111]  When you look at a true compromise, a compromise is both sides give a little and both sides get a little, and that's what we feel that concealed handgun licensing laws are.
[01:18:12.151 --> 01:18:15.953]  I mean, if you look at what proponents of gun control typically want, they want
[01:18:17.011 --> 01:18:19.932]  You know, training, testing, expanded background checks, and licensing.
[01:18:20.452 --> 01:18:28.056]  And basically what concealed handgun licenses say is, okay, we're going to go through all that, but in return, you're going to let us carry our handguns in public for our own protection.
[01:18:28.576 --> 01:18:35.339]  And to me, I think that's the perfect compromise, and of course, whenever you suggest it, they just come out, you know, in arms against it.
[01:18:36.852 --> 01:18:38.073]  Well, you're on the offensive.
[01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:38.954]  That's what matters.
[01:18:38.974 --> 01:18:46.839]  I want to come back and talk more about this organization that's exploding in size and how our listeners, who are college students across the country, can get involved.
[01:18:47.239 --> 01:18:49.501]  We'll be right back with Scott Lewis and Mike Guzman.
[01:18:52.819 --> 01:18:56.443]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[01:18:56.743 --> 01:19:00.307]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:54.731]  You wear a seatbelt in your car.
[01:19:54.991 --> 01:19:56.272]  At home, you lock the doors.
[01:19:56.552 --> 01:19:58.273]  How about when you use your cell phone?
[01:19:58.493 --> 01:19:59.654]  How do you protect yourself?
[01:19:59.954 --> 01:20:05.577]  EMFs, or electromagnetic frequencies, act like an invisible pollution that surrounds us every day.
[01:20:05.797 --> 01:20:12.261]  Studies link EMFs to many ailments, from stress to depression, anxiety, decreased mental performance, low
[01:20:15.424 --> 01:20:20.230]  More than ever we are fatigued, sick, emotionally depleted and generally stressed out.
[01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:24.955]  Have you ever thought about the impact on your health from exposure to EMFs using your cell phone?
[01:20:25.115 --> 01:20:32.043]  Studies show that 30 minutes a day on a cell phone over the span of one year is equivalent to sticking your head in a microwave for 30 minutes.
[01:20:32.703 --> 01:20:39.008]  Installing the BioPro cell phone chip utilizes patented noise field technology to block harmful EMF pollution.
[01:20:39.228 --> 01:20:40.089]  Still not convinced?
[01:20:40.249 --> 01:20:46.193]  Go to ElectroPollution.org right now to purchase the extremely affordable BioPro cell chip.
[01:20:46.293 --> 01:20:48.455]  It attaches easily to the outside of your phone.
[01:20:48.735 --> 01:20:51.758]  Educate and protect yourself at ElectroPollution.org
[01:20:53.138 --> 01:20:55.259]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:20:55.619 --> 01:20:58.701]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:20:58.941 --> 01:21:03.523]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:21:03.883 --> 01:21:06.504]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:21:06.985 --> 01:21:13.728]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:21:14.188 --> 01:21:19.411]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:21:19.871 --> 01:21:21.512]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:21:22.032 --> 01:21:25.314]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:21:25.874 --> 01:21:29.236]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[01:21:29.276 --> 01:21:36.259]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[01:21:36.619 --> 01:21:42.002]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:21:42.342 --> 01:21:43.643]  Share the oil company's secrets
[01:21:46.304 --> 01:22:01.731]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.
[01:22:01.891 --> 01:22:11.936]  Find out about everything from job migration to evacuation information, such as major bridges in disrepair and FEMA evacuation time studies for coastal cities.
[01:22:12.416 --> 01:22:18.259]  Zero in on man-made disaster zones, environmental areas of concern, and natural disaster zones.
[01:22:18.499 --> 01:22:29.245]  Find out everything from where to get water in an emergency, the geographic income levels, housing prices, complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on the 3,000 plus counties in the U.S.
[01:22:29.405 --> 01:22:30.466]  Full color photographs.
[01:22:30.646 --> 01:22:31.206]  We're good to go.
[01:23:02.825 --> 01:23:06.787]  Coming up, Cody Dietz of We Are Change Ohio.
[01:23:08.227 --> 01:23:09.148]  I've watched the video.
[01:23:09.188 --> 01:23:10.728]  The guy's clearly a Fed.
[01:23:12.769 --> 01:23:14.890]  Looks like Secret Service or Federal Marshal.
[01:23:16.031 --> 01:23:20.773]  And people at the bookstore did tell some of the We Are Change people that they were, quote, Secret Service.
[01:23:21.253 --> 01:23:25.975]  I don't know if they were on duty or off duty, but we know that the White House is giving them talking points.
[01:23:26.695 --> 01:23:27.776]  It started with Clinton.
[01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:28.876]  It's continuing with Bush.
[01:23:29.216 --> 01:23:30.397]  They're all on the same team.
[01:23:31.426 --> 01:23:43.072]  And to have Glenn Beck saying Ron Paul supporters are supporting terrorists and should be arrested by the military, and then to see this, really it's starting to concern me in a big, big way.
[01:23:44.032 --> 01:23:54.357]  It's the last person to get off the bus before Beck, then later in the video you see in the crowd other guys that are the spittin' image of central casting of either Secret Service or Federal Marshals.
[01:23:56.178 --> 01:23:57.539]  It's definitely not a local.
[01:23:58.645 --> 01:24:15.172]  But going back to our guest, Scott Lewis and Mike Guzman, who are on the offensive for the Second Amendment and trying to stop what's happening with these victim disarmament zones, incrementally, at first just saying, hey, you shouldn't keep concealed carry folks off these campuses.
[01:24:16.542 --> 01:24:18.864]  For rapes, murders, robberies, you name it.
[01:24:19.524 --> 01:24:20.125]  Absolutely.
[01:24:20.145 --> 01:24:21.906]  We, as citizens, have a right to defend ourselves.
[01:24:21.946 --> 01:24:23.227]  I think everybody should be able to have guns.
[01:24:23.828 --> 01:24:30.293]  I mean, just 20, 30 years ago, everybody had guns on campus, and my dad would bring us shotguns and rifles to school, and you never had shootings.
[01:24:30.673 --> 01:24:33.876]  And if anybody ever tried, they'd be brought down very quickly.
[01:24:34.557 --> 01:24:37.139]  In closing, gentlemen, how do people join your organization?
[01:24:37.899 --> 01:24:39.421]  Do they need to be students to do it?
[01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:42.423]  And once they join, how do they take action for the Second Amendment?
[01:24:43.917 --> 01:24:46.198]  You do not have to be a student to join our organization.
[01:24:46.218 --> 01:24:49.140]  As I said, we have about 8,800 members nationwide.
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:51.261]  We're growing at a rate of about 50 members a day.
[01:24:51.821 --> 01:24:59.284]  And currently, our membership is about 90% students and about 10% faculty, parents, and concerned citizens.
[01:24:59.865 --> 01:25:06.188]  And if they want to join, they can go to our website, which is concealedcampus.com or concealedcampus.org.
[01:25:06.848 --> 01:25:13.091]  And you'll find a link to our Facebook group, as well as a lot of good information and some flyers and handouts they can print out to start distributing on there.
[01:25:13.883 --> 01:25:18.241]  On campus and you'll find updates about upcoming protests and stuff like that.
[01:25:20.174 --> 01:25:20.855]  Absolutely.
[01:25:20.875 --> 01:25:24.157]  Again, we need to get on the offensive, not wait for the NRA.
[01:25:24.177 --> 01:25:43.569]  Did you know the NRA is supporting a new expansion of the instant check system that anybody who has ADHD or post-traumatic stress disorder, it's not just going to ban a lot of veterans from buying or owning guns, it's going to ban a lot of police, according to Gun Owners of America's analysis, and the NRA is supporting that just like they supported the 1968 Gun Control Act.
[01:25:43.969 --> 01:25:45.230]  A, were you guys aware of that?
[01:25:45.330 --> 01:25:46.231]  B, what do you say to that?
[01:25:48.049 --> 01:25:50.852]  I am aware that they are promoting the expansion.
[01:25:50.872 --> 01:25:57.279]  I was not aware of what mental health groups were included in that.
[01:25:57.499 --> 01:26:04.347]  I do believe that we need instant background checks and that there are some people that should not own firearms.
[01:26:04.407 --> 01:26:05.829]  However, I think we need to be careful.
[01:26:06.525 --> 01:26:09.607]  That we do not start making those instant background checks.
[01:26:36.565 --> 01:26:37.286]  Quote revoked.
[01:26:37.567 --> 01:26:39.871]  He should have, but it didn't stop him.
[01:26:40.291 --> 01:26:45.961]  So see, common sense would argue, fine, don't even restrict the loony because it's going to be used on me, not the loony.
[01:26:47.861 --> 01:26:59.131]  Well, the problem I see with the mental health checks, and again, I do think we need checks in place for people that have been adjudicated dangerous to themselves and others that have been adjudicated mentally ill.
[01:26:59.811 --> 01:27:03.194]  But see, now they're raising that bar.
[01:27:03.634 --> 01:27:04.235]  Right, that's what I'm saying.
[01:27:04.255 --> 01:27:10.340]  If you make it too broad, you're going to run into a situation where people may be afraid to seek help for mental health problems because they're afraid it may
[01:27:10.928 --> 01:27:21.273]  Well, they also come out with over 100 new mental illness designations a year to put more people on drugs.
[01:27:21.813 --> 01:27:28.456]  I mean, they're basically designating... My point is, now, if the system just says you have a problem, you're instantly convicted.
[01:27:28.497 --> 01:27:29.337]  Comments to that, Mike?
[01:27:31.348 --> 01:27:32.029]  Well, I don't like it.
[01:27:32.109 --> 01:27:33.510]  I'm a former Marine myself.
[01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:37.173]  I have friends with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, things of that sort.
[01:27:37.593 --> 01:27:41.316]  And the fact of the matter is, if people want to commit a crime with guns, they're going to get a gun.
[01:27:41.796 --> 01:27:42.377]  Exactly.
[01:27:42.417 --> 01:27:46.300]  I believe 80% of all guns that are used in crimes were obtained illegally.
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:50.083]  So really, the background checks and all these, they seem good.
[01:27:50.103 --> 01:27:51.064]  They seem like they work.
[01:27:51.284 --> 01:27:53.546]  But if someone really wants a gun, they're going to get one anyway.
[01:27:54.887 --> 01:27:55.748]  Amen to that.
[01:27:56.288 --> 01:27:58.310]  We've got a lot of listeners in Central Texas.
[01:27:59.531 --> 01:28:01.032]  You're down in Southwest Texas, right?
[01:28:02.737 --> 01:28:03.178]  Texas State.
[01:28:03.598 --> 01:28:04.899]  Yeah, they just changed the name, didn't they?
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:06.080]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:06.821 --> 01:28:09.083]  I just can't get used to it not being Southwest Texas.
[01:28:09.383 --> 01:28:10.504]  You're at Texas State.
[01:28:10.864 --> 01:28:15.468]  If people in Austin want to get involved, I guess there's sub-areas on the membership to get involved?
[01:28:16.729 --> 01:28:19.592]  Yeah, you can find their local campus leader on our website.
[01:28:20.502 --> 01:28:22.023]  All right, well, I salute you.
[01:28:22.083 --> 01:28:23.725]  I hope people join you.
[01:28:24.205 --> 01:28:28.188]  ConcealedCampus.org to Scott Lewis and Mike Guzman.
[01:28:28.508 --> 01:28:33.713]  I salute both of you for defending this republic from enemies foreign and domestic and defending the Second Amendment.
[01:28:34.413 --> 01:28:34.994]  Well, thank you for having us.
[01:28:35.014 --> 01:28:35.614]  Thank you for having us.
[01:28:36.134 --> 01:28:36.615]  God bless.
[01:28:36.635 --> 01:28:38.877]  Have a great Christmas that's coming up.
[01:28:39.157 --> 01:28:42.479]  We'll be right back with your phone calls, We Are Change, and a lot more.
[01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:43.620]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.981 --> 01:28:45.622]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.523 --> 01:28:49.245]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.472 --> 01:28:54.813]  America is the fattest nation on the planet.
[01:28:54.893 --> 01:29:01.397]  The obesity epidemic kills over 300,000 Americans each and every year, and this number continues to rise at an alarming rate.
[01:29:01.557 --> 01:29:04.659]  With fast food chains everywhere, eating right is not an easy task.
[01:29:04.879 --> 01:29:08.041]  It's time to stop eating those unhealthy meals and fattening snacks.
[01:29:08.301 --> 01:29:10.962]  Assured that you and your family do not become a statistic.
[01:29:11.202 --> 01:29:13.424]  Introducing the Excalibur Dehydrator.
[01:29:13.544 --> 01:29:16.465]  The Excalibur Dehydrator brings healthy eating to a whole new level.
[01:29:16.525 --> 01:29:21.348]  The Excalibur Dehydrator preserves fruits, vegetables, fish, and beef quickly and easily.
[01:29:21.508 --> 01:29:30.132]  The Excalibur Dehydrator is perfect for vegetarians, vegans, and those who want to cut out the unnecessary salt, fat, and preservatives in most foods found at the grocery store.
[01:29:30.292 --> 01:29:34.954]  Gardeners, you'll love how much time and money you'll save making your own herbs and spices from your own kitchen.
[01:29:35.074 --> 01:29:37.655]  Hunters, keep your cash and make your own jerky from home.
[01:29:37.815 --> 01:29:40.176]  It's amazing all the uses you'll find with your new Excalibur Dehydrator.
[01:29:40.336 --> 01:29:41.479]  Call 1-800-875-4254 or go to Drawings123.com
[01:29:52.532 --> 01:29:54.213]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[01:29:54.493 --> 01:29:56.174]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[01:29:56.374 --> 01:30:00.376]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[01:30:00.596 --> 01:30:03.638]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[01:30:03.818 --> 01:30:07.640]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.181]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[01:30:10.301 --> 01:30:13.563]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices.
[01:30:13.663 --> 01:30:13.923]  I think so.
[01:30:29.471 --> 01:30:30.132]  We're good to go.
[01:30:52.592 --> 01:31:02.255]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[01:31:02.315 --> 01:31:07.277]  The whole country's on a bus with a crazy driver, but the passengers can't get hold of the wheel.
[01:31:07.677 --> 01:31:08.638]  We're all gonna go over the cliff.
[01:31:08.658 --> 01:31:12.080]  The government's gonna know where everybody's at since every minute of the day and night.
[01:31:37.537 --> 01:31:37.817]  We're good.
[01:32:07.779 --> 01:32:11.723]  I know we've got Mack, Richard, Anthony, Monty and others that are holding.
[01:32:13.065 --> 01:32:15.127]  I haven't even gotten into the economic news.
[01:32:15.267 --> 01:32:20.873]  I haven't covered a bunch of election news, environmental news.
[01:32:20.993 --> 01:32:25.298]  It's all coming up as we reach the halfway point here today.
[01:32:28.729 --> 01:32:33.653]  And I've been so busy I haven't even told you, reminded you that it is the season, the Christmas holidays.
[01:32:34.073 --> 01:32:35.234]  Why fight the traffic?
[01:32:35.314 --> 01:32:40.298]  Why fight the traffic for ties or socks or underwear or things people don't want?
[01:32:41.118 --> 01:32:42.399]  Or sweaters they never wear?
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.742]  Give the gift of enlightenment, the gift of a wake-up call.
[01:32:46.222 --> 01:32:49.624]  Go get a PrisonPlanet.tv monthly membership for $5.95, a trial membership,
[01:32:52.205 --> 01:32:52.745]  We're good to go.
[01:33:13.835 --> 01:33:19.165]  Uh, and that also gives us a present, the funding to continue what we're doing and expand what we're doing.
[01:33:19.205 --> 01:33:21.790]  Get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership today.
[01:33:22.311 --> 01:33:23.313]  Fifteen cents a day.
[01:33:23.353 --> 01:33:25.316]  Get a yearly membership and get three months free.
[01:33:26.557 --> 01:33:37.664]  And thousands of audios, hundreds and hundreds of videos, all 17 of my films, in-game, both editions of Terror Storm, all at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:38.624 --> 01:33:51.892]  15 cents a day at PrisonPlanet.tv, or call, or go to InfoWars.com, the secure online shopping cart, and order in-game on DVD, or loose change, final cut, the preeminent 9-11 film, all new,
[01:33:53.733 --> 01:33:59.178]  There's big discounts on Endgame when you get it with loose change, by the way.
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:05.204]  We can't discount loose change because I don't own the whole film, but I can discount Endgame.
[01:34:05.244 --> 01:34:10.569]  You can get Endgame with it and get a big discount at InfoWars.com, on the DVD, or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:34:10.589 --> 01:34:10.629]  888-253-3139.
[01:34:20.442 --> 01:34:25.463]  Or prisonplanet.tv to see him online right now.
[01:34:27.044 --> 01:34:38.527]  Okay, going now to Cody Dietz with We Are Change Ohio, who went and covered the Glenn Beck situation.
[01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:40.868]  Before we go to him, I just want to say this.
[01:34:40.948 --> 01:34:42.408]  You know, the last guest I had on
[01:34:43.863 --> 01:34:48.144]  ConcealedCampus.org has got 8,800 and growing members.
[01:34:48.164 --> 01:34:50.825]  There'll be 9,000 by the end of the week, 50 new members a day.
[01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:55.407]  They are, have had hundreds of demonstrations all over the country.
[01:34:55.447 --> 01:34:57.707]  They're educating students how they've been turned into victims.
[01:34:58.208 --> 01:34:59.248]  They are turning the tide.
[01:35:00.989 --> 01:35:11.592]  Just like We Are Change started in New York 14 months ago and now has 50-something chapters across the world, 40-something of them here in the U.S., England, the Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Japan,
[01:35:13.044 --> 01:35:18.671]  They're out every day confronting neocons, confronting fake liberals, confronting corrupt politicians.
[01:35:18.731 --> 01:35:25.179]  Giuliani got confronted, it was in the Boston Globe, over and over again when he was in New Hampshire.
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:31.427]  And then I saw it on the news last night when I was at the radio studio on the TVs up on the wall.
[01:35:32.865 --> 01:35:34.046]  That's what it's about.
[01:35:34.186 --> 01:35:37.188]  It's about you taking action.
[01:35:37.228 --> 01:35:41.071]  And I want to encourage listeners to do that with Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:35:41.351 --> 01:35:42.572]  Have parties at your house.
[01:35:43.052 --> 01:35:43.893]  Show it to people.
[01:35:44.333 --> 01:35:45.414]  Do it with Endgame.
[01:35:45.474 --> 01:35:46.075]  Have parties.
[01:35:46.195 --> 01:35:46.575]  Show it.
[01:35:46.975 --> 01:35:47.756]  Rent theater.
[01:35:47.816 --> 01:35:50.378]  Show it at the church.
[01:35:50.538 --> 01:35:53.560]  Show it at the library.
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:56.641]  I don't care if ten people show up to your first meeting.
[01:35:56.901 --> 01:35:57.941]  Take action!
[01:35:58.381 --> 01:36:02.303]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv, burn copies of Endgame all day on the disc.
[01:36:02.763 --> 01:36:03.563]  Give them to people.
[01:36:04.463 --> 01:36:08.985]  Take that same grassroots action and put it into place.
[01:36:09.425 --> 01:36:21.029]  That's why, from Fox to CNN to MSNBC, and that's why now on C-SPAN and Pentagon reports and Rand Corporation reports and Simon Wiesenthal reports saying that
[01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:25.773]  Mainline architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth are with Al-Qaeda.
[01:36:27.013 --> 01:36:29.375]  They're doing this and they're saying we're taking over.
[01:36:29.415 --> 01:36:30.956]  They're saying they're scared of us.
[01:36:31.516 --> 01:36:33.417]  They're saying we've got to be grabbed.
[01:36:33.518 --> 01:36:34.278]  It's not going to work.
[01:36:34.318 --> 01:36:35.039]  There's too many of us.
[01:36:35.459 --> 01:36:37.220]  They know the revolution has started.
[01:36:38.261 --> 01:36:41.643]  And they know that we know that their bosses carried out the attacks.
[01:36:42.103 --> 01:36:45.185]  We're not going to stand by where they kill more of us and kill our country.
[01:36:46.594 --> 01:36:49.095]  Now is the time to get aggressive, to get active.
[01:36:49.515 --> 01:36:51.596]  And by aggressive, I mean educating people.
[01:36:51.636 --> 01:36:55.517]  It's your right to stand up and confront Hillary about how she's bankrolled by Fox.
[01:36:56.157 --> 01:37:03.959]  It's your right to confront the President whenever he goes out to stand up in a crowd, just like that Chinese doctor did about how they're killing people for their organs.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:05.600]  I praise her.
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:12.462]  It is your First Amendment right in the great spirit of Americana, but in the great spirit of liberty and renaissance, period.
[01:37:13.969 --> 01:37:17.032]  It's your right to go to town hall meetings they advertise as public.
[01:37:17.332 --> 01:37:20.254]  It's your right to go to a book signing and tell somebody you disagree with them.
[01:37:20.674 --> 01:37:26.559]  Every video signing I've ever had, you know, at least one or two people show up and disagree, and I don't freak out and cry and scream.
[01:37:26.859 --> 01:37:27.820]  They come up and talk to me.
[01:37:28.801 --> 01:37:32.644]  And one guy got in my face, and I just said, okay punk, you said what you wanted, now get out of my face.
[01:37:32.964 --> 01:37:34.385]  It's my right to say that back to them.
[01:37:35.085 --> 01:37:37.788]  You know, we're not going to live in fear, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:37.908 --> 01:37:39.869]  We're going to take action against them.
[01:37:40.209 --> 01:37:42.531]  But they're not scared of violence, as they say they are.
[01:37:42.631 --> 01:37:43.352]  There is no violence.
[01:37:44.753 --> 01:37:46.434]  Though they may stage something, that's clear.
[01:37:47.395 --> 01:37:59.043]  They're scared of the illusion being broken at every book signing, at every televised event, or us videotaping it ourselves and putting it on YouTube and Google and all the other video, Live Link, the rest of it.
[01:37:59.503 --> 01:38:01.504]  They are scared of the alternative media.
[01:38:01.564 --> 01:38:07.088]  They know it's shifting from just an alternative media to an activist media that is becoming dominant.
[01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:12.172]  They know that they're guilty of covering up for a corrupt system.
[01:38:12.212 --> 01:38:12.772]  They're scared.
[01:38:14.056 --> 01:38:15.497]  This is history we're witnessing.
[01:38:15.797 --> 01:38:26.280]  So if you've been on the bench, and you've been sitting back and haven't gotten involved with Ron Paul, or haven't gotten involved in anti-war, you don't like the anti-war socialists that control the movement, create your own anti-war movement.
[01:38:26.941 --> 01:38:29.882]  See, this is, we are going to take this country back.
[01:38:30.342 --> 01:38:30.582]  Okay?
[01:38:30.602 --> 01:38:31.422]  We don't have a choice.
[01:38:32.303 --> 01:38:34.904]  The more we lay down, the worse it's going to be.
[01:38:36.964 --> 01:38:37.224]  Okay?
[01:38:37.244 --> 01:38:39.485]  The more we stand up, the better our future's going to be.
[01:38:39.805 --> 01:38:41.646]  The system now knows the people are man.
[01:38:42.975 --> 01:38:45.336]  This isn't some fake Ross Perot revolution.
[01:38:45.356 --> 01:38:47.756]  This isn't some little, you know, thing with George McGovern.
[01:38:48.176 --> 01:38:50.117]  This is the real deal.
[01:38:50.797 --> 01:38:51.637]  And they know it.
[01:38:52.117 --> 01:38:59.279]  Every political analyst, every sociologist has said, America has never seen a realignment like this since 1775.
[01:38:59.579 --> 01:39:05.160]  They have never seen anything like this since the 1770s.
[01:39:05.821 --> 01:39:06.161]  Okay?
[01:39:06.441 --> 01:39:07.641]  And this is an info war.
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:10.523]  As I've always pushed, always preached.
[01:39:10.543 --> 01:39:13.526]  Alright, I know we've got lots of callers and a ton of stuff I've got to cover.
[01:39:14.528 --> 01:39:16.851]  Right now, let's go ahead briefly and go to our guest.
[01:39:16.891 --> 01:39:19.494]  And I've got some financial news coming up here in about 10 minutes.
[01:39:19.514 --> 01:39:22.798]  And then your calls, I promise, the whole third hour for those that are patiently holding.
[01:39:24.353 --> 01:39:26.034]  Let's go ahead and go to Cody Dietz.
[01:39:26.094 --> 01:39:27.515]  We are Change Ohio.
[01:39:27.656 --> 01:39:28.956]  Great job, Cody.
[01:39:29.457 --> 01:39:30.377]  We've seen the video.
[01:39:30.417 --> 01:39:31.558]  Clearly feds there.
[01:39:32.479 --> 01:39:38.943]  And, of course, some of the other We Are Changers we've now confirmed did hear the staff saying they were Secret Service and were feds.
[01:39:39.403 --> 01:39:41.565]  And we know they go to the White House and get talking points.
[01:39:42.586 --> 01:39:44.707]  This is very, very serious.
[01:39:45.768 --> 01:39:47.209]  Let's now go ahead and go to Cody.
[01:39:47.249 --> 01:39:48.249]  Cody, what did you witness?
[01:39:50.011 --> 01:39:50.531]  I witnessed
[01:39:51.757 --> 01:39:53.419]  Uh, just a handful of stuff, man.
[01:39:53.479 --> 01:39:58.943]  I just want to let the people out there know when they go to these Beck events to interview all these guys.
[01:39:59.783 --> 01:40:01.024]  Ask everybody questions.
[01:40:01.164 --> 01:40:02.285]  Ask where they're coming from.
[01:40:02.305 --> 01:40:03.566]  Ask how they know Beck.
[01:40:03.606 --> 01:40:10.171]  Just start asking them questions because what they're out to do, what they're out there to do is to ask you questions to get information from you.
[01:40:10.611 --> 01:40:13.253]  And when you start quizzing them, it'll get real shady.
[01:40:13.653 --> 01:40:14.774]  It's all intimidation.
[01:40:14.834 --> 01:40:15.735]  It's all intimidation.
[01:40:15.835 --> 01:40:16.616]  It's secret police.
[01:40:16.676 --> 01:40:16.976]  Go ahead.
[01:40:17.546 --> 01:40:23.628]  But when you start questioning, they'll get real shady, especially about questions about where they're from and how they know Beck.
[01:40:24.069 --> 01:40:26.329]  They'll get real, real shady when you start asking them.
[01:40:26.449 --> 01:40:31.131]  And I hadn't even realized what was going on until I got home and started editing my video.
[01:40:31.812 --> 01:40:36.673]  When I heard that cop say they were undercovers there, I hadn't heard him say that when I asked him the question.
[01:40:36.713 --> 01:40:38.294]  I heard that when I was editing the video.
[01:40:38.854 --> 01:40:42.916]  And then I started to go back through and look at some of my footage, and I was like, oh my gosh.
[01:40:44.088 --> 01:40:48.597]  And, I mean, the Glenn Beck topic was enemies among us, and it's literal.
[01:40:49.309 --> 01:40:53.870]  And it might not be who you think it is, just some average people asking some strange questions.
[01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:54.970]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:40:55.010 --> 01:41:02.332]  They're talking about enemies among us and using the military against the evil people and how these evil people are going to events and asking people questions.
[01:41:02.752 --> 01:41:06.453]  And then you get there and there's clearly undercover feds, and they're feds, you can look at them.
[01:41:06.693 --> 01:41:07.914]  We heard that from the bookstore.
[01:41:08.454 --> 01:41:11.735]  I mean, this is secret police for evil Americans!
[01:41:12.115 --> 01:41:16.916]  We're evil Americans that would dare go ask questions, and to them, that's already illegal.
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:29.706]  And the amazing thing is that Hollywood sensationalizes spying, but I think that domestic surveillance is the highest form of treason that there is.
[01:41:30.763 --> 01:41:42.996]  Well, remember, people that peacefully demonstrated giving out free coffee and cocoa and cookies two years ago at Halliburton in Houston, then were spied on by army intelligence and tracked and listened to.
[01:41:43.637 --> 01:41:45.319]  And that's just one example of thousands.
[01:41:45.699 --> 01:41:48.482]  But people, don't let this intimidate you.
[01:41:49.403 --> 01:41:50.985]  They cannot track us all.
[01:41:51.445 --> 01:41:52.547]  They're scared.
[01:41:53.207 --> 01:41:56.969]  Of us messing up their illusions that the people buy it.
[01:41:57.369 --> 01:42:00.971]  It's the fact that all their stage town halls are being disrupted.
[01:42:01.031 --> 01:42:05.514]  It's the fact that all their staged events and that we're breaking through their electronic Berlin Wall.
[01:42:05.894 --> 01:42:07.915]  They want to bring America down.
[01:42:08.235 --> 01:42:10.476]  This shows the power we have.
[01:42:11.077 --> 01:42:11.777]  Do you agree?
[01:42:11.797 --> 01:42:13.618]  Oh, totally.
[01:42:14.939 --> 01:42:21.302]  And to any of those people that are going to come down from their ivory tower and give Ohio a visit, I will be there with my camera.
[01:42:21.795 --> 01:42:24.101]  And I will be asking questions and getting answers.
[01:42:25.817 --> 01:42:28.197]  Well, I was the only one there that was really, you know, vocal
[01:42:55.462 --> 01:43:02.045]  As far as demonstration goes, and uh... I didn't wait for them to get to me.
[01:43:02.326 --> 01:43:07.568]  I would, like, right when they were real close to me, I would turn around and walk away under my own willpower.
[01:43:08.088 --> 01:43:10.410]  And that gave me the opportunity to go back in again.
[01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:17.413]  And at the Columbus event, I was able to go in a second time, and the second time is when the officer says, didn't I escort you out once?
[01:43:17.453 --> 01:43:21.015]  And I said, no, I left under my own willpower, and I'll do it again if you let me go.
[01:43:21.035 --> 01:43:23.276]  You can clearly hear me say that in the video.
[01:43:23.795 --> 01:43:25.536]  And he gets real upset by that.
[01:43:25.956 --> 01:43:45.386]  And I do want to stress, when you go to something like this, get there a little bit early, and go to the cops, tell them your name, tell them what you're there for, tell them what you're doing, tell them what to expect, because when I got to the door, one of the cops that I'd been talking to for a little while told the officer that had my arm behind my back to go ahead and let me go, that I was alright.
[01:43:46.026 --> 01:43:48.827]  So just that little 30 minute of talking to the cop explained myself.
[01:43:48.867 --> 01:43:52.149]  Yeah, let's be clear, you got grabbed on just going and asking questions.
[01:43:52.808 --> 01:43:53.068]  Yeah.
[01:43:53.308 --> 01:43:53.849]  Yeah, I did.
[01:43:54.309 --> 01:43:55.369]  Tell us how that happened.
[01:43:56.029 --> 01:43:57.390]  Give people the blow-by-blow on that.
[01:43:58.190 --> 01:44:04.553]  Well, it was the second time I'd gone on there, or the second time I'd gone up to confront them.
[01:44:05.274 --> 01:44:17.279]  And basically what happens is, it delegates down from Glenn's personal goons or whatever, they delegate to the police, and then the police take care of whatever they tell them to do.
[01:44:17.299 --> 01:44:21.621]  So it's totally, totally a pyramid scheme, and the
[01:44:22.873 --> 01:44:23.774]  I talked to the cops.
[01:44:23.794 --> 01:44:27.178]  The cops have no idea about any political views.
[01:44:27.198 --> 01:44:28.399]  They say I don't worry about it.
[01:44:28.479 --> 01:44:33.585]  And I try to stress to the police that, you know, these laws affect you as much as everybody else.
[01:44:34.905 --> 01:44:44.753]  But since when do cops taser and grab people who just, I mean, we've seen the video, you're just going, hey Beck, why are you saying that Ron Paul supporters are terrorists?
[01:44:44.773 --> 01:44:53.720]  And they're like, oh, oh, oh, it's like, I mean, it's just total ninnying, a nation of just, oh my gosh, he's speaking in speech, that's horrible!
[01:44:56.562 --> 01:45:00.485]  Yeah, man, I... What did you think of the way Glenn looked?
[01:45:00.505 --> 01:45:04.328]  I mean, I'm watching the different videos, he's just looking at the crowd with hatred.
[01:45:06.468 --> 01:45:07.748]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:45:08.969 --> 01:45:09.629]  We're peasants.
[01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:15.831]  But he literally has the worst frat boy Eddie Haskell arrogance.
[01:45:16.452 --> 01:45:17.972]  I mean, Royals even knows how to hide it.
[01:45:17.992 --> 01:45:19.933]  He just looks at people like they're pathetic.
[01:45:20.173 --> 01:45:21.934]  And he has that little smirk on his face.
[01:45:23.914 --> 01:45:26.435]  Yeah, he... Well, I mean, I didn't get to see too much of it.
[01:45:26.475 --> 01:45:28.316]  He was trying to ignore me as much as possible.
[01:45:28.376 --> 01:45:33.458]  I know he got a good look at me when I was waiting outside his bus with his copy of his Vendetta.
[01:45:33.498 --> 01:45:33.818]  He knew
[01:45:34.645 --> 01:45:43.951]  He knew who I was, he knew what I was about before I even... And you were there saying, hey I want to give you a copy of Ivar Vendetta so you'll know what the 5th of November is about, and he just walked past you.
[01:45:44.751 --> 01:45:46.792]  Yeah, totally, totally didn't pay attention.
[01:45:46.832 --> 01:45:51.115]  And I tried, if you see in the video, I tried to give it to every member of his staff.
[01:45:51.655 --> 01:46:01.081]  I even go as far as to slide it in on the bus when the door was open and then you see one of the goons take it off the bus and set it on the window.
[01:46:01.101 --> 01:46:02.902]  I just, I don't know.
[01:46:03.604 --> 01:46:06.506]  And if I could take a second to plug a couple things.
[01:46:06.586 --> 01:46:10.509]  You know, you can have all the ideas, but if you don't have the means, you're really not moving the ball.
[01:46:12.131 --> 01:46:18.395]  I'm auctioning off the copy of He Is For Vendetta and the book to anybody that wants to confront back in their hometown.
[01:46:18.435 --> 01:46:20.457]  They can buy the package and give it another shot.
[01:46:20.917 --> 01:46:26.362]  The link is located at the We Are Change and the description of my video.
[01:46:27.723 --> 01:46:31.786]  Also, he signed Ron Paul's book and that's being auctioned off.
[01:46:31.886 --> 01:46:33.307]  All proceeds will be given to Ron Paul.
[01:46:34.446 --> 01:46:36.851]  Is there a website yet for the Ohio We Are Change?
[01:46:37.452 --> 01:46:40.618]  The first chip-in I get is going to register my domain.
[01:46:41.279 --> 01:46:42.662]  I have the Toronto Change.
[01:46:42.722 --> 01:46:44.125]  It's going to set everything up for me.
[01:46:44.145 --> 01:46:45.067]  I just need that first $10.
[01:46:46.574 --> 01:46:55.498]  I'm going to use this opportunity to tell everybody something.
[01:46:55.858 --> 01:47:04.022]  There's a $2,000, and I said December 5th, but we haven't promoted it on Prison Planet or InfoWars yet, and so we've only gotten a few entries.
[01:47:04.042 --> 01:47:10.665]  So I'm going to push it back to December 10th, but that's it, because I want to be able to announce it for the December 16th, 17th.
[01:47:10.745 --> 01:47:15.707]  It'd be good if the Ron Paul ad promoted that, or it could promote the Ron Paul campaign, period.
[01:47:16.848 --> 01:47:27.637]  $2,000 first place, $500 second place, $100 third place, and a one-time, one-place, and one first-place winner, $500 for the best 60-second radio ad.
[01:47:28.557 --> 01:47:31.600]  That's a good way for activist groups to make $2,000.
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:37.425]  Somebody else is going to make $500, and it will be announced December 11th.
[01:47:37.565 --> 01:47:40.307]  It needs to be in by December 10th.
[01:47:40.347 --> 01:47:41.188]  That's the last time.
[01:47:41.248 --> 01:47:43.570]  I said December 5th, but that's too soon.
[01:47:44.490 --> 01:47:47.453]  I announced it last Monday, and I haven't really promoted it.
[01:47:47.993 --> 01:47:52.416]  We're having a Ron Paul video contest, and I appreciate you coming on, Cody.
[01:47:52.436 --> 01:47:52.997]  God bless you.
[01:47:53.497 --> 01:47:54.238]  Well, one sec.
[01:47:54.298 --> 01:48:00.983]  If I could tell all the Ohio people, my WeAreChangeOhio.org or DocBuffs.com will be up pretty soon.
[01:48:01.403 --> 01:48:05.887]  And I want to say how important Ohio is in this movement as far as exposing election fraud.
[01:48:06.287 --> 01:48:07.348]  It's a big thing here.
[01:48:07.548 --> 01:48:13.933]  And once I get a camera and get everything going, I will be at hospitals giving interviews about the vaccine.
[01:48:14.528 --> 01:48:15.348]  Good job.
[01:48:15.388 --> 01:48:17.009]  Listen, listen.
[01:48:17.349 --> 01:48:21.511]  I got a guest coming up, so we gotta move on here.
[01:48:21.571 --> 01:48:22.272]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:48:22.352 --> 01:48:24.533]  I'll be more than happy to talk to you during the break, okay?
[01:48:24.793 --> 01:48:25.553]  We're going to break.
[01:48:25.613 --> 01:48:26.374]  Stay there, alright?
[01:48:27.814 --> 01:48:30.035]  I just wanted to finish up with this announcement.
[01:48:30.856 --> 01:48:34.737]  We're having the video contest, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:36.978 --> 01:48:37.279]  Alright?
[01:48:37.359 --> 01:48:38.379]  Tell everybody about it.
[01:48:38.699 --> 01:48:40.640]  It can promote the 16th and 17th.
[01:48:41.421 --> 01:48:42.181]  That could be a winner.
[01:48:43.385 --> 01:48:53.692]  We need to add that to the... I mean, it says do whatever you want, but that's something we'd like to see to promote the 16th and 17th, the Bill of Rights Day and the Boston Tea Party Day.
[01:48:53.712 --> 01:48:55.113]  We're going to try to raise $10 million in one day.
[01:48:56.674 --> 01:48:58.034]  Please take advantage of that.
[01:48:58.595 --> 01:49:02.998]  Please to... and we're making a film about 9-11 truth and activism.
[01:49:04.659 --> 01:49:05.119]  Okay?
[01:49:05.719 --> 01:49:12.844]  And so, anybody who's in We Are Change or InfoWars groups or just political activists out there, if you want your clip
[01:49:13.673 --> 01:49:22.417]  In the new film we're making mail it to us in the best quality you can with a letter giving us saying you own the footage and giving us authorization to use it in our film.
[01:49:23.597 --> 01:49:26.139]  Now I'm almost done logging like 400 hours of video.
[01:49:27.699 --> 01:49:36.063]  Okay that's here at my office and we've only got a few weeks left so if you want to have a shot at being in my next film we're going to put out pretty quick probably by
[01:49:39.273 --> 01:50:07.041]  April or so of next year then get us your video in mail it to us, but we can't use it without the release form Okay, we got another guest surprise guest coming up the next segment, and then I promise we're going to get to mark Richard Anthony Monty and others It is a big idea a new world order in the near future birth is dominated It's known as the builder birth What their objective be world domination?
[01:50:07.662 --> 01:50:10.105]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[01:50:10.846 --> 01:50:18.176]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:21.198 --> 01:50:26.182]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:26.682 --> 01:50:30.124]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:30.505 --> 01:50:33.026]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:33.066 --> 01:50:34.047]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:34.067 --> 01:50:35.008]  They're not after money.
[01:50:35.028 --> 01:50:36.108]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:36.309 --> 01:50:36.729]  They're after power.
[01:50:36.749 --> 01:50:38.070]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[01:50:47.917 --> 01:50:49.598]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:49.938 --> 01:50:51.099]  You have been warned.

[01:51:52.145 --> 01:51:57.630]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:51:58.070 --> 01:52:02.294]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:52:02.715 --> 01:52:09.581]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:52:10.021 --> 01:52:16.724]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:52:17.044 --> 01:52:18.645]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:52:18.945 --> 01:52:22.127]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:52:22.407 --> 01:52:24.868]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:52:25.168 --> 01:52:26.309]  BioSolutions has over 550
[01:52:27.389 --> 01:52:27.909]  We're good to go.
[01:52:58.103 --> 01:53:06.585]  Oil is surging right now, about to crest the magic $100 per barrel mark on fears of a weakening dollar.
[01:53:06.645 --> 01:53:08.606]  Here's the AP headline, here's another.
[01:53:25.009 --> 01:53:30.192]  From AFP, Euro trades close to $1.50, all-time record.
[01:53:31.273 --> 01:53:36.556]  See, if the dollar stays at $1.49, that's a decimated, destroyed dollar.
[01:53:37.857 --> 01:53:40.679]  If it continues the slide, it means fiscal Armageddon.
[01:53:41.359 --> 01:53:45.021]  So, of course, gold last week went down about $30 in price.
[01:53:45.702 --> 01:53:47.123]  It always does those corrections.
[01:53:47.143 --> 01:53:52.086]  If you look at the graph like a mountain range, it keeps going straight up in the last five years.
[01:53:53.863 --> 01:53:58.947]  But it has little dips as people take profit and dump their gold.
[01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:10.677]  If folks don't take action now to at least protect some of your dollars that are literally being devalued by the day, then I don't know what I can say to you.
[01:54:10.737 --> 01:54:12.558]  I know you're going, wait a minute, my stock's up.
[01:54:13.039 --> 01:54:14.540]  That's with inflated dollars.
[01:54:15.321 --> 01:54:17.022]  The stock market is really below $7,000 now.
[01:54:17.122 --> 01:54:17.302]  Okay?
[01:54:22.139 --> 01:54:27.990]  And the fact that we've got a dropping housing market while the dollar gets weaker means dropping
[01:54:28.766 --> 01:54:31.228]  Prices while you have a deflating dollar?
[01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:32.369]  That's insane!
[01:54:32.730 --> 01:54:40.917]  So we're seeing really bad economic numbers here, and I'm just telling you to do what I do, get into gold, get into silver, get into these two metals.
[01:54:41.037 --> 01:54:42.298]  Silver hasn't even moved yet.
[01:54:42.318 --> 01:54:47.283]  It's moved a couple bucks up, but that's not even half of what it will move up if it is going to correct.
[01:54:47.843 --> 01:54:53.028]  Gold is only at half of its 1980 level versus dollar purchasing power.
[01:54:54.449 --> 01:54:59.828]  Ted Anderson was able to get a bunch of gold and silver last week when gold went down.
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:09.903]  And so he's offering it to you at last week's prices, what he's got in his vault in silver rolls and in British Sovereigns.
[01:55:10.503 --> 01:55:11.804]  Ted, tell them about the offer.
[01:55:12.144 --> 01:55:18.666]  Well, right now Alex, we have the British Sovereign at $225 and the silver dollar rolls are at $400 per roll at $20.
[01:55:18.846 --> 01:55:22.447]  And like you said Alex, we just had a correction in the marketplace.
[01:55:22.487 --> 01:55:23.607]  It was just last week.
[01:55:23.667 --> 01:55:24.888]  It didn't last very long.
[01:55:24.928 --> 01:55:25.548]  I think it maybe
[01:55:26.748 --> 01:55:29.669]  One or two days and then all of a sudden gold's back up over 800.
[01:55:29.709 --> 01:55:32.070]  And these two, they lasted months in the charts.
[01:55:32.110 --> 01:55:34.110]  See, it's getting, folks, it's serious.
[01:55:34.190 --> 01:55:42.133]  I mean, Ted, a lot of analysts, not a lot, they're all saying the fact that it corrected so shortly and then went right back up is a sign it's going up.
[01:55:42.293 --> 01:55:45.015]  Well, the dollar is looking for liquidity right now.
[01:55:45.075 --> 01:55:47.237]  Every time we turn around, the dollar is getting beat up.
[01:55:47.597 --> 01:55:51.600]  I mean, the Chinese would like to get out of their $1.3 trillion.
[01:55:51.861 --> 01:55:55.343]  They have actually more control over our economy than the Federal Reserve does.
[01:55:55.744 --> 01:55:57.825]  I mean, it's crazy the way that things are going right now.
[01:55:58.226 --> 01:56:02.189]  If you're sitting at all in cash, or if you have money in the stocks or wherever,
[01:56:02.569 --> 01:56:05.532]  You know, the real estate market, like you said, has fallen out of bed.
[01:56:06.012 --> 01:56:07.954]  The dollar is falling at the same time.
[01:56:07.994 --> 01:56:09.495]  That amplifies that problem.
[01:56:09.835 --> 01:56:11.677]  And then you have the stock market right now.
[01:56:11.777 --> 01:56:14.019]  The credit card debt is at its all-time high.
[01:56:14.279 --> 01:56:19.484]  Personal, private, corporate debt, government debt, it's a perfect storm, are at all-time highs.
[01:56:20.084 --> 01:56:23.067]  Now the derivatives are going to start unraveling next year.
[01:56:23.607 --> 01:56:25.148]  Yeah, and it's all coming together.
[01:56:25.168 --> 01:56:26.910]  Like you said, Alex, it's a perfect storm.
[01:56:26.930 --> 01:56:28.351]  That's a great way to explain it.
[01:56:28.671 --> 01:56:30.753]  There's no reason to be in cash right now.
[01:56:30.773 --> 01:56:32.614]  There's no reason to be in the stock market.
[01:56:32.654 --> 01:56:38.259]  All my IRAs and the retirement plans, all that stuff, you have to get the heck out of it.
[01:56:38.559 --> 01:56:39.500]  Tell them about the offer.
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:41.301]  Well, right now, it's the silver dollars.
[01:56:41.462 --> 01:56:43.663]  They're at $400 per roll of 20.
[01:56:43.743 --> 01:56:46.125]  Again, the British Sovereign, $225.
[01:56:46.165 --> 01:56:50.389]  A great way to get into a small piece of gold and have it for its tradable.
[01:56:50.769 --> 01:56:51.650]  It's just the way to go.
[01:56:54.632 --> 01:57:06.337]  686-2237 is the telephone number to call to take advantage of it and right now Alex I mean besides the fact that they're supporting your show and getting this kind of information out call 1-800-686-2237 that is a very very good offer 1-800-686-2237 1-800-686-2237
[01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:15.261]  2-2-3-7.
[01:57:15.682 --> 01:57:22.848]  And if you're listening tonight during a rebroadcast on different stations, they'll be there till about 11 o'clock Central Standard Time.
[01:57:22.868 --> 01:57:23.028]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:57:23.048 --> 01:57:29.853]  Your calls straight ahead when we get back and a ton of other news.
[01:57:30.213 --> 01:57:32.615]  Thank you for listening to GPN.
[01:57:32.635 --> 01:57:34.097]  Visit GPNlive.com today.
[01:57:48.442 --> 01:57:49.103]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.744 --> 01:57:50.825]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.526 --> 01:57:52.627]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.288 --> 01:57:54.109]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.850 --> 01:57:55.811]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.432 --> 01:58:00.097]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.618 --> 01:58:04.683]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.076 --> 01:58:11.161]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll free number to join us.
[01:58:11.541 --> 01:58:15.124]  Mark, Richard, Anthony, Monty, I appreciate you all holding.
[01:58:15.164 --> 01:58:18.327]  I'm going to go write your calls quickly in the next segment.
[01:58:19.448 --> 01:58:25.494]  After I take 10 or 15 calls as quickly as possible, I want to get into the UN saying tasers are a form of torture.
[01:58:26.306 --> 01:58:28.608]  And explain why they're coming out and saying that.
[01:58:28.628 --> 01:58:32.430]  It's just classic operations by these people.
[01:58:32.450 --> 01:58:37.453]  I also want to get more into the Extinction Movement and the story out of the Boston Globe.
[01:58:37.754 --> 01:58:41.876]  The Amero conspiracy saying we're making all of that up and a lot more.
[01:58:41.896 --> 01:58:45.639]  But Ted was walking out of the studio up in Minnesota and I called him back.
[01:58:45.699 --> 01:58:47.620]  Ted, I only had you on about three minutes.
[01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:49.021]  I wanted to ask you a few more questions.
[01:58:50.365 --> 01:58:56.432]  When I get up here and I say people should buy high quality water filters that we advertise or get them somewhere else.
[01:58:56.452 --> 01:58:59.555]  Let's make sure they're a good filter, a purification, not just a filter.
[01:59:00.330 --> 01:59:02.612]  When I say get storable food, it's because I believe in it.
[01:59:02.692 --> 01:59:08.098]  Or when I say get out of metals, I mean, get out of paper and get into metals.
[01:59:08.158 --> 01:59:13.803]  Or if you're in paper metals, cash the paper in, get physical holdings of metals.
[01:59:14.404 --> 01:59:15.525]  I mean, that's what you do, Ted.
[01:59:15.585 --> 01:59:20.409]  You sell metals for paper and then you take your profit, I know, and buy metals and put it in your own little safe.
[01:59:21.410 --> 01:59:23.813]  I mean, I told people, buy the Ron Paul dollars.
[01:59:24.947 --> 01:59:25.868]  I think we're good to go.
[01:59:51.275 --> 01:59:53.516]  I mean, Ted, we talked privately.
[01:59:53.556 --> 01:59:54.956]  We're both completely freaked out.
[01:59:55.096 --> 01:59:56.536]  What do you think's going to happen?
[01:59:56.556 --> 02:00:03.038]  I mean, the dollar, last week I was going, I hope the slide stops on air, but I said it's not probably going to, folks.
[02:00:03.758 --> 02:00:07.839]  I mean, even if the slide stops, it's going to be devastating as far as it slid.
[02:00:07.859 --> 02:00:10.960]  I don't like the fat golds going up like this.
[02:00:11.941 --> 02:00:15.325]  I mean, because overall, it means the economy is just gone.
[02:00:16.246 --> 02:00:18.768]  Alex, right now, there's no question about it.
[02:00:18.828 --> 02:00:24.514]  I mean, again, with China holding as many reserves as they are, Germany's got a ton of U.S.
[02:00:24.554 --> 02:00:25.955]  dollars and U.S.
[02:00:26.035 --> 02:00:26.576]  treasuries.
[02:00:26.596 --> 02:00:32.241]  In the Middle East, these people hate us, and they're holding on to great reserves, and they're turning over to different currencies.
[02:00:32.622 --> 02:00:35.545]  They're all looking at their own portfolios, watching it melt away.
[02:00:35.965 --> 02:00:37.366]  And they'd like to find liquidity.
[02:00:37.387 --> 02:00:42.031]  Any one of them dumps it on the marketplace, the dollar plummets much faster than it is.
[02:00:42.532 --> 02:00:44.313]  All that stuff is looking for liquidity.
[02:00:44.654 --> 02:00:50.279]  Unfortunately they have more currency than there's volume trading in the marketplace to absorb.
[02:00:50.659 --> 02:00:53.102]  So any one of them dump it once, I mean the dollar takes a
[02:00:53.462 --> 02:00:54.002]  Free fall.
[02:00:54.042 --> 02:01:00.126]  I mean, we could look at what happened to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, right here in the United States, within very short order.
[02:01:00.486 --> 02:01:02.527]  And economists are calling for this, too.
[02:01:02.888 --> 02:01:12.953]  I was debating my nephew that came out of Harvard Business here just earlier this year, and he's saying that the people over there are saying the same thing.
[02:01:12.973 --> 02:01:14.674]  The United States dollar is doomed.
[02:01:14.794 --> 02:01:15.275]  Exactly.
[02:01:15.415 --> 02:01:17.336]  I could sit here, but don't believe me, listeners.
[02:01:17.396 --> 02:01:19.197]  Go to Google, type dollar.
[02:01:20.217 --> 02:01:20.297]  Yeah.
[02:01:33.937 --> 02:01:34.578]  Curtains!
[02:01:35.599 --> 02:01:38.201]  And they're all saying conservatively $2,000 gold.
[02:01:38.341 --> 02:01:39.342]  I'm not even saying that.
[02:01:39.402 --> 02:01:47.990]  Well, this is exactly why Ron Paul right now is pushing up for us to get away from the Federal Reserve System and back onto a gold standard, because we're melting right now.
[02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:52.374]  The United States cannot afford the Iraq or the Iran war coming.
[02:01:52.774 --> 02:01:56.538]  We just can't afford the bases we have all over the world.
[02:01:56.878 --> 02:02:01.583]  The United States has pushed itself off and borrowed prosperity from places like China.
[02:02:01.844 --> 02:02:03.846]  They've been financing us, but you know what?
[02:02:04.426 --> 02:02:05.508]  They want to get away from it.
[02:02:05.548 --> 02:02:07.049]  They don't want to continue on with this.
[02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:10.271]  And we're in a position where the dollar is going to fall.
[02:02:10.451 --> 02:02:14.172]  There is no way that the United States dollar is going to become a world currency again.
[02:02:14.212 --> 02:02:14.872]  That's done.
[02:02:15.192 --> 02:02:17.453]  The only debate is how far will it drop.
[02:02:17.553 --> 02:02:19.374]  Give the brokers a call, folks.
[02:02:19.414 --> 02:02:20.814]  Get in on these gold deals.
[02:02:20.854 --> 02:02:23.875]  Last week's corrected prices now surging back up.
[02:02:24.155 --> 02:02:25.155]  1-800-686-2237, 1-800-686-2237, or MidasResources.com.
[02:02:25.316 --> 02:02:27.937]  Ted, what's gold at right now?
[02:02:27.977 --> 02:02:29.357]  Right now, Spot, gold is at 827.10.
[02:02:29.577 --> 02:02:31.999]  It's going straight up like a rocket, folks.
[02:02:32.019 --> 02:02:33.159]  It's just today.
[02:02:33.239 --> 02:02:33.739]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:33.779 --> 02:02:34.660]  A new world order.
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:36.541]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by power.
[02:02:59.207 --> 02:03:01.669]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:02.389 --> 02:03:09.734]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:12.719 --> 02:03:17.702]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:18.183 --> 02:03:21.685]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:22.045 --> 02:03:24.567]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:03:24.627 --> 02:03:25.768]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:25.788 --> 02:03:26.548]  They're not after money.
[02:03:26.568 --> 02:03:27.629]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:27.849 --> 02:03:28.590]  They're after power.
[02:03:28.830 --> 02:03:29.850]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[02:05:33.298 --> 02:05:36.980]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:41.902]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[02:05:43.743 --> 02:05:49.706]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:51.355 --> 02:05:57.198]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls and I'll get into this story from InfoWars.net up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:05:57.698 --> 02:06:00.659]  They live taser saucer to become a reality.
[02:06:01.159 --> 02:06:11.484]  Taser International to sell and distribute flying drones that fire self-guided 50,000 volt taser systems to be used against crowds.
[02:06:11.964 --> 02:06:14.245]  Microwave guns, sound cannons,
[02:06:14.965 --> 02:06:18.388]  Flying saucers with dozens of stun missiles.
[02:06:18.928 --> 02:06:20.930]  They've already got shotguns that fire them.
[02:06:21.530 --> 02:06:23.432]  All about just running us down.
[02:06:23.452 --> 02:06:27.735]  A lot of these people want to be in the military, but now the military doesn't face foreign enemies.
[02:06:27.755 --> 02:06:32.218]  They overrun with horses and saucer drones and high-tech, low-tech weapons.
[02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:36.521]  We're going to see such nightmares, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:36.561 --> 02:06:37.682]  You wait till the drones see.
[02:06:37.902 --> 02:06:42.646]  First, it's the image of cops tasering pregnant women for not, you know, showing their papers.
[02:06:44.127 --> 02:06:47.950]  Next is going to be just the crowds out peacefully protesting, and you know the cops want to use them.
[02:06:48.150 --> 02:06:54.234]  Here come the flying saucers, and they're firing their missiles, shelf-guided tasers.
[02:06:55.554 --> 02:07:12.485]  Literally, it just targets onto the crowd, and then, that's what's happening with the technology getting so cheap, okay, I said I'd get to it in a minute, is that now a chip, 20 years ago, would have cost $5,000 to guide a cruise missile, or to guide a precision-guided bomb, and now it costs a dollar.
[02:07:13.340 --> 02:07:17.844]  And they just stick that little chip and it just scans, locks on to each target, fire and forget!
[02:07:19.585 --> 02:07:23.108]  Just like in, uh, what was that movie with Tom Selleck, Runaway?
[02:07:23.428 --> 02:07:26.871]  Where they shoot the gun and it shoots the little missiles that follow you and blow your arm off?
[02:07:27.737 --> 02:07:33.782]  I mean that's it folks, just literal saucers down the street.
[02:07:34.443 --> 02:07:40.729]  Aggravated felons, black water, illegal aliens, rage forces just literally having their way with you.
[02:07:40.929 --> 02:07:46.534]  They just can't wait with Glenn Beck on TV calling us all terrorists as the illegal aliens machine gun us in the back.
[02:07:47.194 --> 02:07:54.481]  Because that's what these drones and all this get you used to is the image of people being shot and the rubber bullets and the big flashes and the next it'll be real guns.
[02:07:55.922 --> 02:07:56.763]  Alright, I'm ranting.
[02:07:56.823 --> 02:07:58.684]  It's true, because I know what they're doing.
[02:07:58.724 --> 02:08:00.005]  It's a military program.
[02:08:02.087 --> 02:08:05.470]  By the way, my mother's dad actually sold them one of these systems.
[02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:08.532]  He actually was an inventor and developed one, but they just shelved it.
[02:08:09.033 --> 02:08:10.054]  It's a big robot.
[02:08:10.434 --> 02:08:11.575]  It's remote-controlled.
[02:08:11.595 --> 02:08:17.700]  It's a drone, ground drone, and it rolls in on treads, and it's got these wires that shoot out and these poles on it.
[02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:18.260]  This was in the 60s.
[02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:19.942]  It shocks people.
[02:08:21.064 --> 02:08:23.005]  They've got all kinds of stuff like that, folks.
[02:08:23.285 --> 02:08:24.426]  And, uh, just enjoy it!
[02:08:24.446 --> 02:08:26.187]  Just enjoy the military ruling!
[02:08:26.207 --> 02:08:29.729]  Uh, let's go ahead and, uh, go to Mark in Florida.
[02:08:29.769 --> 02:08:30.670]  Thanks for holding, Mark.
[02:08:30.690 --> 02:08:32.611]  Uh, is that me?
[02:08:32.991 --> 02:08:33.231]  Yes, sir.
[02:08:33.271 --> 02:08:33.571]  Go ahead.
[02:08:33.591 --> 02:08:34.612]  Hi, Alex.
[02:08:34.652 --> 02:08:35.212]  My name's Mack.
[02:08:35.232 --> 02:08:36.293]  It's a real pleasure to be on here.
[02:08:36.313 --> 02:08:37.234]  I'm sorry, Mack.
[02:08:37.354 --> 02:08:37.754]  Go ahead.
[02:08:38.374 --> 02:08:39.055]  Not a problem at all.
[02:08:39.075 --> 02:08:39.655]  Not a problem at all.
[02:08:40.157 --> 02:08:46.159]  Hey, real quick, even though it's probably old news to you, just the furthering of the Ron Paul, just trying to ignore him.
[02:08:46.559 --> 02:08:53.462]  He's winning the AOL poll by about 4% over Rudy Giuliani, and there's no mention of anyone on the page.
[02:08:53.802 --> 02:08:58.484]  He had to dig through like four different pages to find his face on anything, and he's winning the damn thing, on the darn thing.
[02:08:58.524 --> 02:08:59.344]  It's just crazy.
[02:09:00.364 --> 02:09:07.647]  But my question to you is, my dad's extremely conservative, loves Rush Limbaugh, thinks he's just great, drives me crazy.
[02:09:08.257 --> 02:09:11.278]  And I keep trying to find a way to hack into his head.
[02:09:12.079 --> 02:09:15.260]  How would you talk to someone who's so entrenched in ideology?
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:18.421]  I would say, hey, Bush has crippled the size of the government.
[02:09:18.441 --> 02:09:25.724]  I would print off, type it into Google, you'll find the... It was in a bunch of papers where the Bushes said Clinton is a member of their family.
[02:09:25.744 --> 02:09:26.725]  They vacationed with him.
[02:09:27.535 --> 02:09:34.540]  I would give him Clinton Bush and the CIA, CIA officer Terry Reid, where the Clintons and the Bushes were involved in narcotics traffic.
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:35.961]  He witnessed it together.
[02:09:35.981 --> 02:09:40.665]  I would give them the story about defense contractors giving double to Hillary.
[02:09:40.685 --> 02:09:44.768]  Would they give to anybody else more than double, more than all candidates combined in either party?
[02:09:45.028 --> 02:09:48.210]  Not together, but more than all Democrats, or then separately more than all Republicans.
[02:09:48.651 --> 02:09:50.212]  Put the two sides together, it's more than her.
[02:09:51.477 --> 02:09:58.158]  I would give him the New York Times article, which spins it, but says, yeah, Fox News is behind Hillary.
[02:09:58.598 --> 02:10:03.099]  I mean, they've got the Fox News clip saying, beat people to a pulp that ask Hillary questions.
[02:10:03.459 --> 02:10:04.119]  Taser us.
[02:10:05.079 --> 02:10:15.941]  And just explain, also the article two weeks ago, a bunch of articles, they admitted the story that they're appointing all these former Clinton people to the State Department and Defense Department for a transition.
[02:10:16.322 --> 02:10:18.802]  The White House sees it as Hillary's already in.
[02:10:20.283 --> 02:10:21.344]  Uh, Henrich has said it.
[02:10:21.364 --> 02:10:23.145]  They're all saying it's a far gone conclusion.
[02:10:24.166 --> 02:10:27.809]  And you just need to explain that to him and explain that both sides are owned.
[02:10:28.549 --> 02:10:32.172]  And that, uh, you know, uh, Limbaugh still makes jokes about the NAU.
[02:10:32.532 --> 02:10:34.414]  He still makes jokes about the CFR.
[02:10:34.854 --> 02:10:37.596]  And tell your daddy that if he really loves this country, he better wake up.
[02:10:37.636 --> 02:10:40.879]  Give him the Larry Pratt letter they put up on gunowners.org.
[02:10:40.899 --> 02:10:42.220]  We have links to it on InfoWars.
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:44.723]  Big Banner shows the Second Amendment.
[02:10:44.763 --> 02:10:49.649]  We'll link over there for the Second Amendment, where it shows how we're going under UN regulation.
[02:10:49.669 --> 02:10:52.613]  It shows how the NRA is supporting gun control bills.
[02:10:53.013 --> 02:10:56.898]  I mean, give him a whole package and say, look, both parties are together.
[02:10:56.978 --> 02:10:58.780]  It's time for you to stop being fooled by this.
[02:11:02.230 --> 02:11:04.812]  And, you know, a lot of times people won't listen to their own son.
[02:11:04.872 --> 02:11:10.437]  They'll think you're trying to show off, or you're dumb, or he'll remember when you needed to have your, you know, diapers changed.
[02:11:10.878 --> 02:11:14.041]  Salesmen will tell you that family's about three times harder to sell.
[02:11:15.002 --> 02:11:19.546]  Cold call, where people don't know you, don't know your background, good or bad, is easier.
[02:11:20.266 --> 02:11:24.790]  It's harder to sell a vacuum cleaner to your daddy than it is to sell to somebody you don't even know.
[02:11:25.371 --> 02:11:28.634]  It's easier to sell a widget to somebody you don't know.
[02:11:29.790 --> 02:11:47.802]  And so, unfortunately, I wouldn't waste your time with your dad, or I'd take a matter-of-fact deal, and I'd get serious with him, and I'd say, Daddy, I love you, and I'd get him by the shoulders, and I'd say, I've researched this, here's a folder of info, and if you're really serious, you just tell him I'm not coming back over to see you again until you read this, and at least comment on it.
[02:11:48.483 --> 02:11:56.188]  And you say, if that's serious, and if you really want to shake him up, and don't go over there for a couple years, see how Daddy, see if Daddy starts looking into it.
[02:11:57.176 --> 02:12:01.338]  Now if it's that important to you, to wake your dad up, that's how you do it.
[02:12:01.778 --> 02:12:05.099]  But you don't do it real, oh I know you think it's kooky and then dad laughs.
[02:12:05.299 --> 02:12:06.840]  You say, hey this isn't a joking matter.
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:09.241]  The country's too far gone, stop joking.
[02:12:09.861 --> 02:12:11.282]  And you say, here's the stuff, I'm leaving.
[02:12:11.942 --> 02:12:13.603]  Okay, that's how you get people's attention.
[02:12:16.104 --> 02:12:20.846]  Okay, if you love Rush Limbaugh more than you love this country, then you love him more than you love your son.
[02:12:21.446 --> 02:12:22.526]  Now you want results?
[02:12:23.147 --> 02:12:23.967]  Did you hear what I just said?
[02:12:23.987 --> 02:12:26.168]  Oh yeah, absolutely, every word of it.
[02:12:26.764 --> 02:12:28.265]  Now I'm not saying that's what you should do.
[02:12:28.685 --> 02:12:29.745]  I'm saying that's what I'd do.
[02:12:30.425 --> 02:12:30.785]  I like it.
[02:12:31.326 --> 02:12:31.646]  I like it.
[02:12:33.186 --> 02:12:33.686]  Anything else?
[02:12:34.507 --> 02:12:35.027]  One more thing.
[02:12:35.367 --> 02:12:36.827]  I had a thought when I was on hold for you.
[02:12:37.207 --> 02:12:40.929]  Have you ever thought about doing a gift card for any advertiser you have?
[02:12:41.069 --> 02:12:44.570]  If you could do like a hundred bucks to any affiliate Alex Jones service?
[02:12:46.130 --> 02:12:51.932]  Well I'm a small operation that can hardly carry the trash out or keep the lights on because we're so busy.
[02:12:54.841 --> 02:13:05.207]  It would be good to have like a gift card, you know, I guess for my videos or something, but it's just easier just to buy them the videos or the books or to buy them a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[02:13:05.468 --> 02:13:23.679]  We should make up a deal where it is a gift card for PrisonPlanet.tv members to give to others, but really you can just make up your own card, buy your own card at the store for a dollar, and then stick the codes in it on a little printout saying, here's your membership, all you do is enter your username and your passcode, and then it's a gift to yourself, you can use it too.
[02:13:24.605 --> 02:13:24.845]  Okay.
[02:13:25.245 --> 02:13:26.486]  Hey, I appreciate your call, Mac.
[02:13:26.546 --> 02:13:27.087]  God bless you.
[02:13:27.567 --> 02:13:28.928]  Richard in Nebraska.
[02:13:28.988 --> 02:13:29.868]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:13:31.569 --> 02:13:34.211]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment.
[02:13:34.431 --> 02:13:49.721]  I heard you at the beginning of the program, and I know that you worry about foreign government influence in America, and that brought to mind an article I read back in the 1980s where
[02:13:51.992 --> 02:14:13.125]  It was mainstream media in a newspaper where it commented in New York City where virtually they said at the time in this article that virtually every single business building in that city was owned by a foreign investment.
[02:14:14.289 --> 02:14:16.590]  Nothing was American at the time in there.
[02:14:16.810 --> 02:14:20.712]  And now, because of devaluing the dollar, it makes it a fire sale.
[02:14:20.752 --> 02:14:26.555]  Like when I was a teenager, we'd go down to Mexico with 20 bucks, you could spend the whole weekend there and stay in a motel.
[02:14:27.275 --> 02:14:28.236]  Well, not anymore.
[02:14:28.336 --> 02:14:29.816]  The peso's approaching the dollar.
[02:14:30.617 --> 02:14:34.378]  And now that's happening here, so it's accelerating that transfer.
[02:14:34.919 --> 02:14:35.959]  Oh, that's so bad.
[02:14:36.219 --> 02:14:37.120]  That's so bad.
[02:14:40.063 --> 02:14:47.309]  It's good for the New World Order and they can put a Glenn Beck and a Limbaugh and a Hillary up there and act like they're fighting with each other and that fools the public.
[02:14:47.749 --> 02:14:59.399]  Oh and one other thing I wanted to comment too, you know when I mention anything about the current world situation and what's going on, anything from gold, silver,
[02:15:00.055 --> 02:15:02.597]  And I'll tell my relatives this.
[02:15:18.994 --> 02:15:20.615]  No, I understand and I appreciate your call.
[02:15:20.795 --> 02:15:27.319]  If family won't listen to you, the best thing to do is give them an end game or loose change final cut.
[02:15:45.845 --> 02:15:47.547]  Those are the two best films out there, bar none.
[02:15:48.147 --> 02:15:49.248]  America, Freedom to Fascism.
[02:15:50.189 --> 02:15:54.533]  Give them the video and say, hey, use reverse psychology.
[02:15:54.553 --> 02:15:55.734]  This film's terrible.
[02:15:55.914 --> 02:15:58.717]  It's really radical and controversial.
[02:15:59.097 --> 02:16:02.280]  Tell me what you think, and then they'll come back and say, the government's evil, dummy!
[02:16:04.183 --> 02:16:09.307]  There's a lot of these yuppies and people that like to pick on their family members and act real smart and cool at dinner.
[02:16:10.728 --> 02:16:14.491]  They will actually say the government's bad if you say it's good, but you don't want to be manipulative.
[02:16:14.511 --> 02:16:15.631]  I think it's best to not do that.
[02:16:16.632 --> 02:16:18.954]  Besides, think about people's minds that are like that.
[02:16:20.175 --> 02:16:23.297]  They'll just say whatever they think their neighbor wants to hear at any time.
[02:16:24.458 --> 02:16:26.760]  It's just, look, the videos are the things to give people.
[02:16:27.521 --> 02:16:29.922]  Anthony in Ohio, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:16:31.123 --> 02:16:31.884]  Hey, what's up Alex?
[02:16:31.924 --> 02:16:32.044]  Hi.
[02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:37.401]  I just want to give massive props out to my buddy, Cody, who went out there.
[02:16:38.142 --> 02:16:39.382]  I was actually there with him.
[02:16:40.362 --> 02:16:46.665]  Something he actually didn't mention, we had an individual, this was a guy with like a dark leather jacket.
[02:16:46.725 --> 02:16:48.905]  This is confronting Glenn Beck, yeah.
[02:16:49.265 --> 02:16:50.006]  Correct, correct.
[02:16:50.486 --> 02:16:54.647]  I know you get a lot of calls, so I'm going to make this real quick.
[02:16:54.747 --> 02:17:02.070]  Right as Cody was up there with the camera, these guys kind of flock onto him, and this one guy comes up to us and just kind of starts talking to us.
[02:17:02.586 --> 02:17:03.106]  I don't think so.
[02:17:03.146 --> 02:17:04.487]  I don't think so.
[02:17:29.677 --> 02:17:30.098]  Stay there.
[02:17:30.118 --> 02:17:31.279]  I want to hear more on the other side.
[02:17:31.299 --> 02:17:34.383]  Then we'll go to Monty Zbigniew and others.
[02:17:34.403 --> 02:17:34.603]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:34.683 --> 02:17:40.610]  Got some other audio clips and key news coming up that I will cover.
[02:17:40.630 --> 02:17:41.211]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.313 --> 02:17:46.233]  Ted Anders for Minus.
[02:17:46.273 --> 02:17:46.553]  November 26, 2007.
[02:17:46.934 --> 02:17:47.554]  Gold 82830.

[02:17:54.456 --> 02:17:56.936]  That's $8.5303, $4.2035, and $2.1018.
[02:17:58.037 --> 02:18:04.159]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[02:18:04.199 --> 02:18:08.580]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yuan revolution.
[02:18:08.940 --> 02:18:17.590]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[02:18:17.610 --> 02:18:20.293]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[02:18:20.553 --> 02:18:24.517]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[02:18:24.718 --> 02:18:31.265]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[02:18:31.605 --> 02:18:32.766]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[02:18:32.966 --> 02:18:38.471]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[02:18:38.571 --> 02:18:38.831]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:38.851 --> 02:18:39.032]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:44.531 --> 02:18:47.032]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:47.092 --> 02:18:53.916]  Did you know that at the 29 Palms Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[02:18:54.636 --> 02:18:57.978]  It discussed the United States military under UN command.
[02:18:58.658 --> 02:19:00.259]  Would the Marines accept this?
[02:19:00.319 --> 02:19:10.864]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[02:19:11.524 --> 02:19:12.964]  Is this what Americans want?
[02:19:13.085 --> 02:19:14.865]  Forced confiscation of guns?

[02:19:45.214 --> 02:19:47.175]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[02:19:47.596 --> 02:19:49.317]  Look, up there in the sky.
[02:19:49.337 --> 02:19:51.058]  It's Non-X-Man.
[02:19:51.478 --> 02:19:52.639]  He's in a dive.
[02:19:52.919 --> 02:19:54.920]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:55.941]  Let's go look.
[02:19:58.187 --> 02:20:01.389]  I'm Non-X-Man, and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[02:20:01.789 --> 02:20:03.130]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[02:20:03.350 --> 02:20:03.811]  Take them out.
[02:20:04.391 --> 02:20:05.092]  Let's see.
[02:20:05.112 --> 02:20:09.634]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[02:20:09.755 --> 02:20:10.515]  Don't worry.
[02:20:10.975 --> 02:20:12.476]  Now there's Non-X nail gel.
[02:20:13.117 --> 02:20:17.519]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:20.141]  Oh, I will, Non-X-Man.
[02:20:20.261 --> 02:20:22.943]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[02:20:25.084 --> 02:20:27.725]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[02:20:28.205 --> 02:20:31.686]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[02:20:32.186 --> 02:20:43.329]  It's in the foot care aisle at Super Setters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[02:20:44.827 --> 02:20:49.091]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:20:49.351 --> 02:20:54.216]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:20:54.456 --> 02:20:55.797]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:20:55.957 --> 02:20:59.320]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:22:04.406 --> 02:22:07.267]  Oh, I wanted to talk to Monty.
[02:22:07.287 --> 02:22:08.008]  He just hung up.
[02:22:08.648 --> 02:22:10.028]  It's the big new Patrick Robert.
[02:22:10.068 --> 02:22:11.129]  Others, your calls are coming up.
[02:22:11.709 --> 02:22:15.431]  And I am going to get into flying saucers with tasers in them.
[02:22:15.491 --> 02:22:16.271]  Yeah.
[02:22:16.731 --> 02:22:18.272]  It's all part of turning the heat up on you.
[02:22:18.292 --> 02:22:20.192]  Letting you know who's boss.
[02:22:20.212 --> 02:22:23.234]  Let's go back to Anthony in Ohio.
[02:22:23.274 --> 02:22:25.375]  He was with We Are Change Ohio and was there.
[02:22:25.975 --> 02:22:28.396]  And you can see it on some of the video, I'm told, by
[02:22:29.381 --> 02:22:30.922]  Cody, he's going to upload more of it.
[02:22:30.962 --> 02:22:32.242]  Yeah, all the plainclothes goons.
[02:22:32.542 --> 02:22:33.882]  Some of them clearly were feds.
[02:22:34.623 --> 02:22:36.243]  The store was telling people that they were feds.
[02:22:36.303 --> 02:22:37.003]  Maybe they were wrong.
[02:22:37.063 --> 02:22:44.806]  Regardless, it was an army of undercover people and public police to protect Glenn Beck from the evil terrorists.
[02:22:44.826 --> 02:22:46.066]  See, oh, there's terrorists!
[02:22:46.086 --> 02:22:46.906]  They're going to get me!
[02:22:46.946 --> 02:22:48.687]  The evil Ron Paul supporters!
[02:22:48.727 --> 02:22:50.528]  So they come out and say, hey, why are you saying that, Glenn?
[02:22:50.568 --> 02:22:52.608]  And, oh, see, they're everywhere!
[02:22:53.188 --> 02:22:54.189]  Put them in camps!
[02:22:54.789 --> 02:22:56.689]  Go ahead, Anthony.
[02:22:56.910 --> 02:22:58.390]  Okay, real quick.
[02:22:59.043 --> 02:23:04.625]  Yeah, so this guy, he comes up to us, he talks to us for a little bit, and he starts asking us questions.
[02:23:05.006 --> 02:23:05.706]  Why are we here?
[02:23:05.786 --> 02:23:06.646]  What are we here for?
[02:23:07.707 --> 02:23:13.889]  Cody, when Glenn Beck comes out, Cody then proceeds to follow him with the camera, and I continue to kind of talk with him.
[02:23:13.909 --> 02:23:17.331]  I'm like, yeah, you know, we just want to kind of, we want to get in B for Vendetta.
[02:23:18.698 --> 02:23:29.028]  His whole spew on the Ron Paul supporters was completely false, so we wanted to give him this movie, maybe he could watch it, you know, kind of a sarcastic kind of humor, but at the same time.
[02:23:29.508 --> 02:23:43.341]  So this guy gets really, really, really, really upset with us, and he's like, oh, like, he walks off, he comes back, and when he comes back to me, I'm talking to him, and he says to me, like,
[02:23:44.068 --> 02:23:45.849]  He's just asking question after question.
[02:23:46.149 --> 02:23:49.790]  So, you know, I just think he's a normal guy, whatever, so I answer his questions.
[02:23:49.810 --> 02:23:50.310]  Oh, yeah, right.
[02:23:51.031 --> 02:23:51.571]  Exactly.
[02:23:51.991 --> 02:23:55.552]  So, as he's walking away... Sorry, I'm getting a call.
[02:23:56.033 --> 02:23:57.353]  I gotta finish up, sir.
[02:23:58.273 --> 02:23:58.693]  What'd you say?
[02:23:59.094 --> 02:24:00.074]  Just finish up the story.
[02:24:00.434 --> 02:24:01.154]  Okay, real quick.
[02:24:02.115 --> 02:24:07.157]  So, as he walks away, I see him go into a bus, and here's the funny part.
[02:24:07.197 --> 02:24:09.478]  He said, yeah, I live around this area.
[02:24:09.618 --> 02:24:11.978]  I live around Cincinnati, Ohio.
[02:24:12.279 --> 02:24:13.339]  That's where I live, and I was like,
[02:24:13.894 --> 02:24:15.615]  You live around Cincinnati, Ohio, huh?
[02:24:15.955 --> 02:24:21.759]  And so I started asking him a couple questions about like sports questions, concert questions and stuff like that.
[02:24:21.779 --> 02:24:22.400]  He couldn't answer me.
[02:24:22.420 --> 02:24:23.820]  He walked into the bus.
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:25.421]  Well, of course he was a liar.
[02:24:25.582 --> 02:24:26.582]  I mean, of course he was a liar.
[02:24:26.602 --> 02:24:27.723]  Do you have any video of this guy?
[02:24:28.243 --> 02:24:30.164]  We actually, unfortunately, didn't.
[02:24:30.505 --> 02:24:31.165]  Unfortunately.
[02:24:31.525 --> 02:24:33.907]  And I was the first one that went up to Glenn Beck.
[02:24:34.452 --> 02:24:37.879]  Uh, you couldn't hear me at all because I was completely the opposite way of going back.
[02:24:37.919 --> 02:24:40.945]  I just said, hey sir, why do you equate Ron Paul with terrorists?
[02:24:40.965 --> 02:24:44.112]  Because you make this out to all the non-violent Ron Paul supporters and of course...
[02:24:44.659 --> 02:24:47.161]  Glenn Beck has to be real sarcastic about it.
[02:24:49.282 --> 02:24:50.523]  I don't remember exactly what he said.
[02:24:50.583 --> 02:24:51.523]  I haven't watched the video.
[02:24:51.543 --> 02:24:52.224]  Well, it's important.
[02:24:52.564 --> 02:24:53.945]  You have video of that that isn't out yet?
[02:24:54.265 --> 02:24:55.426]  Yeah, it's on there.
[02:24:55.466 --> 02:24:56.867]  I was the guy that first went to Ron Paul.
[02:24:56.887 --> 02:24:58.408]  I know, but you're like 10 feet up front.
[02:24:58.428 --> 02:24:59.248]  People can't really hear it.
[02:24:59.288 --> 02:24:59.928]  What did he say?
[02:25:00.769 --> 02:25:03.331]  I said, Sir, why did you acquit Ron Paul the terrorist?
[02:25:03.371 --> 02:25:06.733]  Could you please make the South of Ron Paul to be non-violent?
[02:25:06.793 --> 02:25:09.214]  Ron Paul supporters had to make sure not.
[02:25:09.374 --> 02:25:10.095]  And what did he say?
[02:25:10.740 --> 02:25:12.701]  He just said, oh, I am.
[02:25:12.802 --> 02:25:16.404]  And then his little goon that's next to him kind of laughs, and I walk off.
[02:25:16.464 --> 02:25:20.087]  And then that's when Cody just kind of goes at it.
[02:25:20.147 --> 02:25:22.088]  Cody had a lot of courage in this video.
[02:25:22.208 --> 02:25:23.449]  All right, Anthony, I got to jump.
[02:25:23.509 --> 02:25:24.210]  Great job.
[02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:25.330]  I really appreciate it.
[02:25:25.691 --> 02:25:27.992]  I'm glad that people that are out there doing this are calling into the show.
[02:25:28.012 --> 02:25:29.133]  I'm really proud of our listeners.
[02:25:29.714 --> 02:25:34.157]  Taking action, nine times out of ten, if it's Ron Paul supporters being arrested for Ron Paul signs,
[02:25:34.737 --> 02:25:35.278]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:26:04.062 --> 02:26:04.302]  Good.
[02:26:04.382 --> 02:26:10.326]  Just wanted to let your listeners know, you were recently on the Richard Serrett Show in Toronto here not too long ago.
[02:26:11.186 --> 02:26:12.667]  We're Conspiracy Culture.
[02:26:12.747 --> 02:26:22.313]  We're actually doing the Canadian theatrical premiere of Endgame on Friday, December 7th, 2007 at 9.30pm at the Review Cinema here in Toronto.
[02:26:22.953 --> 02:26:24.834]  Tickets are selling like hotcakes.
[02:26:25.275 --> 02:26:27.296]  We're trying to wake the city up, get them informed.
[02:26:27.696 --> 02:26:28.817]  This is really important.
[02:26:28.857 --> 02:26:32.479]  It touches on the Bilderberg meeting in Ottawa, also at the North American Union.
[02:26:33.027 --> 02:26:36.689]  And I highly suggest to any Canadian listeners out there, check this movie out.
[02:26:36.909 --> 02:26:40.351]  And if you live in Toronto, check the theatre out.
[02:26:40.391 --> 02:26:43.152]  You can find out all the information at conspiracyculture.com.
[02:26:43.713 --> 02:26:44.653]  Well, fantastic.
[02:26:44.693 --> 02:26:45.774]  I appreciate your call.
[02:26:46.254 --> 02:26:48.515]  Yeah, I'm allowing it to be shown for free up there.
[02:26:49.015 --> 02:26:52.397]  I've been asked to also provide free advertising, and it's just time-wise.
[02:26:52.477 --> 02:26:55.699]  I mean, I've plugged my videos one time today.
[02:26:57.580 --> 02:27:01.422]  And they're such a big part of the solution, I should talk a lot more about them.
[02:27:02.604 --> 02:27:05.485]  Uh, but yes, please go to that up in Toronto.
[02:27:05.906 --> 02:27:08.907]  Please get Endgame on DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:27:09.287 --> 02:27:12.549]  And I authorize you to make copies for non-profit, not for sale purposes.
[02:27:12.929 --> 02:27:13.389]  Please.
[02:27:13.829 --> 02:27:20.352]  So we can bring down the New World Order, people like Hillary, people like Glenn Beck, people, I mean, they just have to be exposed.
[02:27:20.392 --> 02:27:22.093]  And Endgame will expose them.
[02:27:22.473 --> 02:27:25.975]  Get Endgame at Infowars.com right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:25.995 --> 02:27:26.555]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:34.281 --> 02:27:37.302]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.202 --> 02:27:41.102]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.843 --> 02:27:51.265]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:27:51.705 --> 02:27:56.426]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:27:56.826 --> 02:27:59.466]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:27:59.946 --> 02:28:03.307]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:28:04.122 --> 02:28:08.444]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:28:08.885 --> 02:28:12.066]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:28:12.666 --> 02:28:15.528]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:28:16.309 --> 02:28:18.430]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:28:18.450 --> 02:28:20.550]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:28:20.570 --> 02:28:20.610]  U.S.
[02:28:20.930 --> 02:28:22.671]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[02:28:22.691 --> 02:28:23.031]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:28:23.051 --> 02:28:23.871]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:28:23.891 --> 02:28:24.572]  Ask for George.
[02:28:44.068 --> 02:28:48.993]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:28:49.313 --> 02:28:51.195]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:28:51.395 --> 02:28:54.438]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:28:54.619 --> 02:28:57.762]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:28:58.062 --> 02:28:59.944]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[02:29:00.204 --> 02:29:03.908]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:29:04.188 --> 02:29:06.831]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:29:07.431 --> 02:29:11.714]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:29:11.934 --> 02:29:16.237]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:29:16.638 --> 02:29:20.981]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, packet B, the unholy alliance.
[02:29:21.281 --> 02:29:25.524]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:29:25.864 --> 02:29:28.506]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy.
[02:29:28.766 --> 02:29:31.731]  Tyrants and Wars, The New World Order, and much more!
[02:29:32.031 --> 02:29:34.475]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:29:34.675 --> 02:29:35.496]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:29:35.516 --> 02:29:35.917]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:29:35.937 --> 02:29:36.858]  And ask for packet B.
[02:29:44.529 --> 02:29:46.370]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:29:46.510 --> 02:29:51.693]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:29:51.853 --> 02:29:53.194]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:29:53.474 --> 02:30:01.639]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:30:01.859 --> 02:30:07.602]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:30:07.762 --> 02:30:09.543]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:30:09.603 --> 02:30:11.764]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:30:11.924 --> 02:30:16.147]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:30:16.327 --> 02:30:18.448]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:30:18.548 --> 02:30:26.473]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:30:26.553 --> 02:30:26.913]  We're good.
[02:30:58.408 --> 02:31:03.093]  Alright, I'm going to continue with your phone calls.
[02:31:15.815 --> 02:31:17.216]  Sue was at the Glenn Beck deal.
[02:31:17.696 --> 02:31:24.200]  I think half the people there must have been our listeners to ask him questions and have the police, the feds, freak out like they were Al-Qaeda.
[02:31:24.240 --> 02:31:26.041]  We don't have people asking questions!
[02:31:26.082 --> 02:31:28.803]  We need to taser them and beat them to pulse, as Fox News says.
[02:31:29.123 --> 02:31:29.704]  It's horrible!
[02:31:29.744 --> 02:31:33.826]  The American people are getting involved and shattering our illusion of control!
[02:31:33.846 --> 02:31:36.948]  We'll get into the taser flying saucers.
[02:31:37.509 --> 02:31:39.570]  I'm not kidding, this is mainstream news.
[02:31:40.598 --> 02:31:40.958]  I think so.
[02:32:00.367 --> 02:32:00.868]  We're good to go.
[02:32:20.655 --> 02:32:27.846]  And if you go to enerfood.com or go to prisonplanet.com and link through on the banner, you get 10% off automatically for being a listener.
[02:32:28.327 --> 02:32:31.773]  But when you also buy in bulk, you get an additional 20% on top of that.
[02:32:36.494 --> 02:32:42.840]  Their new product is Coco Mojo, the healthy immune system boosting hot chocolate by Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:32:43.581 --> 02:32:46.003]  And it is just amazing stuff.
[02:32:46.143 --> 02:32:46.984]  I've had some of it.
[02:32:47.404 --> 02:32:48.865]  You need to go check it out.
[02:32:48.925 --> 02:32:53.530]  It's got a bunch of the antioxidants and key plant extracts in the cocoa.
[02:32:54.110 --> 02:32:57.053]  Great way to get your children to take a healthy vitamin.
[02:32:57.393 --> 02:33:02.937]  You can also mix in the Interfood in with the orange juice or grape juice, and they'll drink that as well, but this really tastes good.
[02:33:03.338 --> 02:33:04.638]  Coco Mojo.
[02:33:04.939 --> 02:33:06.720]  Give them a call 1-866-762-9238, 866-762-9238, or Interfood.com.
[02:33:06.740 --> 02:33:09.682]  Another fine sponsor is the debtor's secret weapon.
[02:33:21.591 --> 02:33:28.679]  And this isn't patriot mythology, magical filings with the Easter Bunny stuff that will get you put in prison.
[02:33:28.980 --> 02:33:30.121]  This is just the secrets.
[02:33:30.241 --> 02:33:31.422]  And I've studied this stuff.
[02:33:31.483 --> 02:33:32.864]  I've never really been in that bad of debt.
[02:33:33.345 --> 02:33:37.009]  I've looked into it, studied it, listened to Clark Howard, all those programs.
[02:33:37.189 --> 02:33:39.652]  I've condensed a lot of knowledge, talked to family, others.
[02:33:40.356 --> 02:33:41.957]  And this is some stuff I didn't know.
[02:33:41.997 --> 02:33:44.097]  A lot of it I did know, but it's common sense things.
[02:33:44.937 --> 02:33:48.278]  Stop harassing phone calls, creditors badgering you.
[02:33:48.318 --> 02:33:50.879]  Learn how to negotiate your own debt without the use of creditors.
[02:33:51.439 --> 02:33:54.520]  Understand how creditors will try to seize your assets and how to keep them from doing it.
[02:33:54.940 --> 02:33:56.021]  This is invaluable stuff.
[02:33:56.041 --> 02:33:59.081]  Understanding the mindset of collectors, so you know how to play their game.
[02:33:59.121 --> 02:34:00.642]  Keep your assets, but lose your debts.
[02:34:01.062 --> 02:34:04.665]  Learn how to obtain good credit regardless of your past credit history.
[02:34:04.845 --> 02:34:08.849]  Give them a call.
[02:34:08.869 --> 02:34:09.369]  877-327-0365.
[02:34:09.389 --> 02:34:13.212]  877-327-0365 or OutIn90.com.
[02:34:13.452 --> 02:34:14.934]  That's OutIn90.com.
[02:34:14.954 --> 02:34:17.035]  Get the book, and with it, three CDs.
[02:34:17.175 --> 02:34:20.978]  One CD's got like 60-something hours of lectures on it about this.
[02:34:21.139 --> 02:34:24.722]  Believe me, you want to be an expert in this stuff, save a lot of money, 877-327-0365 or OutIn90.com.
[02:34:30.939 --> 02:34:32.540]  Going back to the calls.
[02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:35.763]  We'll take a few calls, then get into the Flying Saucer story, and then back into calls.
[02:34:36.183 --> 02:34:36.564]  Robert!
[02:34:37.484 --> 02:34:38.986]  Robert, where are you calling us from today?
[02:34:40.066 --> 02:34:41.888]  I'm calling from California here, Alex.
[02:34:41.908 --> 02:34:42.208]  Welcome.
[02:34:42.669 --> 02:34:43.329]  Good afternoon.
[02:34:45.171 --> 02:34:48.233]  We are working on the Ron Paul campaign out here.
[02:34:48.293 --> 02:34:51.295]  We're trying to get voters to actually walk precincts.
[02:34:52.216 --> 02:34:59.002]  We've got plenty of volunteers out here now doing so, but we're still a little bit shorthanded if we're going to win this.
[02:35:00.177 --> 02:35:03.360]  At least this primary out here and plus in other places.
[02:35:03.380 --> 02:35:05.862]  We need people to get out there and knock on those other stores.
[02:35:05.922 --> 02:35:07.883]  That's why we had Ron Paul on Wednesday.
[02:35:07.923 --> 02:35:08.924]  We re-aired it Friday.
[02:35:09.425 --> 02:35:18.312]  And if people on this show don't know that delegates are needed and people to walk precincts and knock on doors or at least put a yard sign in or at least give ten bucks.
[02:35:18.372 --> 02:35:21.875]  If my listeners don't know that, I don't know what planet they're living on.
[02:35:22.595 --> 02:35:27.840]  Yeah, they can also contact me at ronpaullacontactatyahoo.com.
[02:35:28.576 --> 02:35:31.618]  Hey, listen, that's fine and dandy, but I've got to say something.
[02:35:32.018 --> 02:35:32.799]  And I'm not mad at you.
[02:35:32.879 --> 02:35:35.761]  I want to thank you for what you're doing, Robert.
[02:35:35.801 --> 02:35:36.561]  You are the best.
[02:35:36.622 --> 02:35:39.684]  And you've called in four or five times with plugs for this, and that's fine.
[02:35:40.144 --> 02:35:41.865]  But a lot of shows make this mistake.
[02:35:41.945 --> 02:35:42.566]  This is your first time?
[02:35:42.586 --> 02:35:43.866]  Well, a fellow that sounds like he's called.
[02:35:43.886 --> 02:35:44.607]  I appreciate your call.
[02:35:45.553 --> 02:35:50.374]  If all we do is give out the different activist points and all this, people need to go find that.
[02:35:50.414 --> 02:35:53.415]  And the Meetup group on the Ron Paul website has links to it.
[02:35:53.475 --> 02:35:54.896]  They need to come find you.
[02:35:55.256 --> 02:35:58.177]  My point is, we can't spoon-feed this for all 50 states.
[02:35:58.697 --> 02:36:02.418]  This is not that big of a radio show, and my whole point is, is we need to talk about issues.
[02:36:02.778 --> 02:36:06.899]  We can't just, hey, there's a showing of this here, hey, our group's here, hey, our group's there.
[02:36:07.239 --> 02:36:08.719]  It makes it un-listenable.
[02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:11.080]  Matt in Alabama, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:36:12.741 --> 02:36:13.521]  Making my call.
[02:36:13.781 --> 02:36:13.921]  Hi.
[02:36:15.797 --> 02:36:17.137]  I'm a big Paul supporter.
[02:36:17.157 --> 02:36:19.378]  I have been since January.
[02:36:19.398 --> 02:36:25.079]  I really started liking him after I learned about Mises and read him back in 2002.
[02:36:26.879 --> 02:36:32.701]  It sounded like you were talking about things you wanted to emphasize in the campaign or in your show.
[02:36:33.461 --> 02:36:35.261]  Earlier in the program I got disconnected.
[02:36:35.281 --> 02:36:37.382]  I've got a big one right now.
[02:36:37.442 --> 02:36:43.223]  I think he's done a great job differentiating himself as being the anti-war candidate.
[02:36:44.255 --> 02:36:48.998]  I do think much of the base thinks there's a legitimate need to go after terrorists.
[02:36:49.919 --> 02:37:01.146]  And I would like to see them much more emphasize, you know, the letters of mark and reprisal, why it's a smarter way to go after the terrorists, why it's a more cost-effective way, why it's better.
[02:37:01.946 --> 02:37:08.931]  And I think we need to put the opposition... But international law, and our own law, that's been out in the U.S.
[02:37:08.951 --> 02:37:11.432]  since its birth, doesn't allow letters of mark.
[02:37:11.452 --> 02:37:13.694]  Now, they're doing it, but they're doing it against the American people.
[02:37:14.861 --> 02:37:23.683]  You know, I just, Alex, you know, the international law thing, I think Republicans especially will understand if we disregard... No, I understand.
[02:37:23.703 --> 02:37:27.043]  You're saying have Paul play politics and say he's going after terrorists.
[02:37:27.663 --> 02:37:39.605]  Well, you know, I'm saying he has said that, and I think it's a smarter policy to play, and I just think it makes sense to put the opposition on the defensive for once.
[02:37:40.145 --> 02:37:43.026]  And, you know, to emphasize, yeah, we're going to bring the troops home,
[02:37:43.772 --> 02:37:49.456]  You know, we're going to save all this money, but there are smarter ways to go after terrorists.
[02:37:49.596 --> 02:37:51.997]  Listen, I'm agnostic on 9-11.
[02:37:52.057 --> 02:38:03.505]  I got the 9-11 video in 2006 when I was living in New York, and I totally got turned on, but I'm agnostic.
[02:38:03.865 --> 02:38:08.508]  But I do know there are a lot of people that have not considered that and not made up their mind.
[02:38:08.548 --> 02:38:09.729]  I'm just thinking it's smart.
[02:38:10.492 --> 02:38:12.593]  You know, for him to start emphasizing that.
[02:38:12.653 --> 02:38:14.615]  He already is the anti-war candidate.
[02:38:14.635 --> 02:38:15.375]  Everybody knows that.
[02:38:15.435 --> 02:38:19.958]  But they want solutions now, and they want a better way to do it.
[02:38:19.978 --> 02:38:23.320]  And I think he's got, you know, incredible stuff now.
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:27.283]  And maybe at the next debate, put the other guys on the defensive.
[02:38:27.703 --> 02:38:33.907]  Say what he would do differently, and make them defend why what we're doing right now is the best thing to do.
[02:38:33.927 --> 02:38:36.649]  And I don't see how he could lose.
[02:38:36.669 --> 02:38:39.291]  I think he would just gain lots of support.
[02:38:40.029 --> 02:38:41.390]  You're saying have the U.S.
[02:38:41.430 --> 02:38:47.494]  government put out like $100 million, they already got a $50 million reward or $30 million on Bin Laden, they're protecting him?
[02:38:49.055 --> 02:39:03.764]  You know, right now they're probably saying... I mean, yeah, he could just score political points, but then, and I appreciate your call, I guess, play along with that whole false paradigm and say, $50 million to get Bin Laden, and, you know, say things like that, but I think a savvy audience would...
[02:39:05.323 --> 02:39:14.430]  Look, Ron Paul needs to keep pointing out that he will defend our borders, strengthen our dollar, cut taxes, and get us out of these foreign entanglements.
[02:39:14.470 --> 02:39:15.411]  That's what's popular.
[02:39:16.272 --> 02:39:22.577]  And if Republican base is too stupid to know that's their only hope, then... Look, he's winning right now.
[02:39:22.597 --> 02:39:25.179]  He's surging in the polls right now just being himself.
[02:39:25.239 --> 02:39:27.080]  But, Matt, I appreciate your points.
[02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:28.942]  Toby in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[02:39:28.982 --> 02:39:29.282]  Go ahead.
[02:39:30.942 --> 02:39:32.324]  I am a huge fan of yours.
[02:39:32.804 --> 02:39:39.613]  I just wanted to say yesterday I went to a big town down by the river here with my wife and my daughter and my son.
[02:39:40.053 --> 02:39:42.256]  She went on one side of the street, I went on the other side of the street.
[02:39:42.516 --> 02:39:47.362]  We took our 11 fact sheets about 9-11 that we got off of 911truth.org.
[02:39:47.662 --> 02:39:50.406]  We put them on windshields all the way down the street, gave them to people.
[02:39:50.846 --> 02:40:01.505]  And I had a blowhorn and I was blowhorning the truth and the cops ended up coming and one of them was telling me he had a problem with my blowhorn and the other cop said he pretty much agrees with me so...
[02:40:02.179 --> 02:40:03.580]  I kind of just left it at that.
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:05.721]  Well, did you tell the officer it's your First Amendment, right?
[02:40:06.041 --> 02:40:06.341]  I did.
[02:40:06.401 --> 02:40:08.162]  I said it's my right to be here on the street.
[02:40:08.643 --> 02:40:12.125]  And, you know, just for your listeners, anybody can do this.
[02:40:12.165 --> 02:40:13.025]  Anybody can go out there.
[02:40:13.085 --> 02:40:16.687]  And if you go on, like, a main street, you're not at a Walmart, you're not at a private property.
[02:40:16.907 --> 02:40:18.208]  You're right on the public street.
[02:40:18.408 --> 02:40:20.649]  There's a lot of people there on the weekends, afternoons.
[02:40:20.729 --> 02:40:21.770]  It's a good time to go out.
[02:40:21.870 --> 02:40:23.731]  I just thought I'd pass that along.
[02:40:24.594 --> 02:40:25.514]  Good job, my friend.
[02:40:25.554 --> 02:40:26.015]  Keep it up.
[02:40:26.115 --> 02:40:34.258]  If everybody would do what you're doing, we'd take this country back overnight, and that's why the establishment is so scared right now, because they know that chain reaction is taking place.
[02:40:35.658 --> 02:40:36.278]  Good job.
[02:40:36.499 --> 02:40:37.719]  Very exciting phone call.
[02:40:38.079 --> 02:40:39.200]  Sue in Pennsylvania.
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:40.760]  She went to one of the Beck events.
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:41.400]  Sue, welcome.
[02:40:41.821 --> 02:40:42.741]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:40:42.861 --> 02:40:49.123]  Yeah, I was at the Camp Hill Barnes & Noble, and that's right across the river from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
[02:40:49.143 --> 02:40:50.664]  So this was at another meeting, he was at.
[02:40:50.684 --> 02:40:52.325]  Another Glenn Beck book signing.
[02:40:52.365 --> 02:40:53.065]  What happened there?
[02:40:53.618 --> 02:40:54.038]  Excuse me?
[02:40:54.358 --> 02:40:54.978]  What happened there?
[02:40:55.519 --> 02:41:00.220]  Well, there were, gosh, this guy's making loads of money on this book, because there were hundreds of people there.
[02:41:00.780 --> 02:41:10.303]  And outside the store there was a line, and you know, there were people with Ron Paul signs for our meetabout there, but me and this other guy said, hey, we need to hit all the people on the inside of the store.
[02:41:10.743 --> 02:41:13.264]  So we took all our Slim Jims and our information, and
[02:41:15.254 --> 02:41:25.383]  We stood right next, about 10 feet from Glenn Beck, giving out Ron Paul solutions for about 15 or 20 minutes, and they could barely hear over us.
[02:41:25.423 --> 02:41:30.827]  In fact, one of the handlers said to us, we can't even hear to give instructions, so we move down a foot.
[02:41:31.408 --> 02:41:35.852]  Every single person that wanted it got, and they were really, the people were really great.
[02:41:35.872 --> 02:41:37.393]  They seemed to know about Ron Paul.
[02:41:37.773 --> 02:41:39.555]  Only one guy said he was for the war.
[02:41:39.995 --> 02:41:45.499]  And everybody was, in fact, they were giving the Slim Jims to Glenn Beck to sign and he was signing them.
[02:41:45.699 --> 02:41:48.301]  By the way, Slim Jims, you mean little handouts with info?
[02:41:48.762 --> 02:41:49.042]  Yeah.
[02:41:49.362 --> 02:41:54.106]  So how many little handouts, little postcards of Ron Paul campaigns did you get out?
[02:42:00.468 --> 02:42:02.629]  Exactly!
[02:42:02.749 --> 02:42:06.770]  Go to his hardcore base and educate him, and I'd go on further.
[02:42:06.830 --> 02:42:15.774]  I'd make copies of Endgame, or Loose Change Second Edition, or Freedom to Fascism, and say, this is what you really need, and if you would do that, oh, it would be so incredible.
[02:42:16.034 --> 02:42:16.454]  I love it!
[02:42:16.494 --> 02:42:17.374]  Listen to our listeners!
[02:42:17.555 --> 02:42:17.995]  Activists!
[02:42:18.155 --> 02:42:18.495]  Activists!
[02:42:18.875 --> 02:42:21.756]  A guy and his wife in Minnesota out handing out 9-11 truth.
[02:42:22.056 --> 02:42:23.677]  You're out there handing out Ron Paul.
[02:42:23.737 --> 02:42:27.598]  Go to every Glenn Beck event and educate, deprogram his base.
[02:42:27.978 --> 02:42:33.200]  And the people, you know, his audience is a deep-seated, educated audience.
[02:42:33.260 --> 02:42:33.980]  They're into it.
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:35.221]  I mean, they're open for Ron Paul.
[02:42:35.261 --> 02:42:47.345]  Well, that's because for two years, or four or five years on radio, really the last two, and he's been all pro-America, anti-NAU, but then always giving fake solutions, and now he's just now flipped.
[02:42:47.865 --> 02:42:50.107]  And so his base is, yeah, a lot of good people.
[02:42:52.148 --> 02:42:56.171]  There were some college students from Hillsdale, and I said, you know, you need some information.
[02:42:56.191 --> 02:42:58.613]  They said, oh no, it's all over the campus.
[02:42:58.653 --> 02:43:00.174]  We know everything about Ron Paul.
[02:43:00.554 --> 02:43:01.435]  So it's out there.
[02:43:03.234 --> 02:43:07.718]  Well, make no mistake, Sue, and you know this, Ron Paul's much bigger than the polls even show.
[02:43:07.758 --> 02:43:10.881]  They've been manipulating those with the bases that they go to.
[02:43:10.941 --> 02:43:17.848]  They know the individuals, the pools of pollies that they're going to, the voters, are neocons and idiots.
[02:43:18.568 --> 02:43:20.590]  And we know they've been trying to suppress Paul.
[02:43:20.670 --> 02:43:25.395]  It's much bigger than the media even says, and that's illustrated by what you're reporting here.
[02:43:26.594 --> 02:43:27.495]  It was good.
[02:43:28.095 --> 02:43:29.076]  It enervated me.
[02:43:29.116 --> 02:43:30.077]  I'm ready to go back out.
[02:43:31.738 --> 02:43:32.578]  Sue, good job.
[02:43:32.999 --> 02:43:34.500]  Mike in New York, you're on the air.
[02:43:34.540 --> 02:43:35.220]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:43:35.761 --> 02:43:36.181]  Three things.
[02:43:36.501 --> 02:43:37.442]  Three quick things.
[02:43:38.543 --> 02:43:39.143]  Go ahead.
[02:43:39.664 --> 02:43:41.185]  I want to thank you for being my friend, bud.
[02:43:41.685 --> 02:43:47.369]  You really opened up my eyes and I've been able to decipher all this media junk that they put out there, the propaganda.
[02:43:48.630 --> 02:43:55.155]  Two, Chuck Baldwin did a news article regarding Bush people giving Hillary
[02:43:56.332 --> 02:44:03.336]  Yeah, they're preparing the transition.
[02:44:03.576 --> 02:44:08.538]  Yeah, I guess Josh Bolton out of the Bush regime there is giving her up with her speech writing.
[02:44:09.559 --> 02:44:23.026]  The second thing, after the Glenn Ivey interview you had on a day or two afterwards, the Today Show had done a little thing and they just got done giving the vaccinations to about a thousand plus students and they had the judge on.
[02:44:24.125 --> 02:44:26.666]  And 4-Eye, did he look like he was in his glory?
[02:44:26.686 --> 02:44:30.488]  He says, this here is a demonstration of the power of judicial persuasion.
[02:44:30.948 --> 02:44:32.868]  Yeah, again, judicial persuasion.
[02:44:32.969 --> 02:44:34.529]  No law to take the shots.
[02:44:34.829 --> 02:44:36.690]  They just lied and said it was the law.
[02:44:36.930 --> 02:44:41.232]  And I did see the judge on MSNBC saying they just intimidated everybody.
[02:44:41.252 --> 02:44:44.773]  They're crowing how they, color of law, fraudulently did this.
[02:44:45.293 --> 02:44:46.274]  Absolutely disgusting.
[02:44:46.994 --> 02:44:47.394]  America?
[02:44:47.814 --> 02:44:48.575]  Civil liberties?
[02:44:49.235 --> 02:44:49.775]  Civil rights?
[02:44:50.515 --> 02:44:50.715]  Yeah.
[02:44:50.996 --> 02:44:51.656]  Due process?
[02:44:51.836 --> 02:44:52.036]  Right.
[02:44:53.137 --> 02:44:54.078]  But thank you, Alex.
[02:44:54.878 --> 02:44:55.779]  Hey, thank you, Mike.
[02:44:55.819 --> 02:44:59.382]  We're going to come back and take a few final calls in this segment, but now let me get into some news.
[02:45:00.543 --> 02:45:02.644]  This is InfoWars.net right now.
[02:45:02.744 --> 02:45:06.287]  They lube Taser Saucer to become a reality.
[02:45:06.988 --> 02:45:16.455]  UN declares stun guns to be instruments of torture, while Taser Rep says it's not real pain and puts drone craft into development.
[02:45:17.315 --> 02:45:21.859]  Now again, the UN will go into Rwanda or dozens of other nations
[02:45:23.112 --> 02:45:45.356]  And they will go in, Katanga and many others, and they will take the people into refugee areas whose land they want, then they'll send in the rebel army to kill everyone, 800 plus thousand is the admitted number, most estimates above 1.2 mil, and then they'll kill them, or rape them, or run sex slave operations, or give them eugenics injections filled with poisons and cancer viruses and AIDS.
[02:45:46.676 --> 02:45:51.137]  So they come out against the torture and that makes them look good, while they just go forward with all of it.
[02:45:52.961 --> 02:45:53.941]  It's the same thing in Europe.
[02:45:53.961 --> 02:45:59.163]  They'll be carrying out all these different tyrannical operations against the population and then the country won't let them appeal.
[02:45:59.463 --> 02:46:03.744]  So then they go to the EU and the EU says you're not allowed to do that to make the EU look good.
[02:46:05.024 --> 02:46:20.809]  But getting back to these, it says one of the biggest Taser representatives outside the US base has declared the company's intention to produce and sell internationally a small drone, airborne drone, version of the weapon that can administer electrical jolts of 50,000 volts.
[02:46:22.472 --> 02:46:35.203]  Antonio De Zouza has told AFP that his French company is developing a mini-flying saucer-like drone which could also fire Taser stun rounds on criminal suspects or rioting crowds.
[02:46:35.323 --> 02:46:42.209]  Fitted nice with the microwave guns and sound cannons, the head of the Air Force said they have to use it on the US citizens first to get around Geneva overseas.
[02:46:43.691 --> 02:46:48.415]  He expects it to be launched next year and to be sold internationally by Taser.
[02:46:49.332 --> 02:46:56.398]  The idea conjures up memories of the flying saucer spy drones and the 1988 dystopic cult classic, the movie, They Live.
[02:46:56.978 --> 02:47:02.843]  The opening of George Orwell's 1984 also features the idea of police flying overhead and snooping into homes.
[02:47:03.263 --> 02:47:05.865]  Now this nightmare vision is set to become reality.
[02:47:06.525 --> 02:47:17.474]  With 250,000 taser guns in use all over the world, it's a lot more than that, I don't know where he got that number, from North America, Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand,
[02:47:18.228 --> 02:47:26.791]  To name just a few of 70 or so countries, it hardly takes a stretch to imagine how to foresee to take up Taser's airborne drones.
[02:47:27.432 --> 02:47:32.714]  In addition, we have also seen moves by police forces around the world to test and use flying drones.
[02:47:33.334 --> 02:47:45.679]  Most recently, controversy was raised after it was discovered that Houston police had secretly for flying spy drones that use high-powered cameras designed to look into buildings or even follow people in moving cars.
[02:47:46.954 --> 02:47:49.675]  Drone planes are not new to the United States.
[02:47:49.695 --> 02:47:53.016]  The military has been using drones for secret war zone surveillance for years.
[02:47:53.056 --> 02:47:56.638]  Drones have also been used in California wildfires last month.
[02:47:56.938 --> 02:48:02.140]  The drones were used to test in Houston, weighed only 40 pounds, but can carry 15 more pounds of gear.
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:06.023]  They also are able to stay airborne for 24 hours without landing.
[02:48:06.524 --> 02:48:17.654]  Reports from June indicate that the Homeland Security used a spy drone to take out a property of income tax protesters, Ed and Elaine Brown, before they were arrested in September.
[02:48:18.435 --> 02:48:22.539]  In April, the British press reported on a British amateur inventor
[02:48:23.425 --> 02:48:26.166]  Who won a contract for the use of the U.S.
[02:48:26.206 --> 02:48:33.169]  government for a three-foot-wide flying saucer contraption, a cross between a hovercraft and a helicopter, which is being considered as a surveillance tool.
[02:48:34.709 --> 02:48:42.352]  So, imagine flying saucers now, backed up by microwave cannons and thousands of police in black ring-wraith outfits.
[02:48:42.732 --> 02:48:43.732]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:45.093 --> 02:48:46.514]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:47.574 --> 02:48:50.215]  A new world order in the near future.
[02:48:51.164 --> 02:48:52.104]  Earth is dominated.
[02:48:52.344 --> 02:48:55.945]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:48:56.025 --> 02:48:59.306]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:48:59.846 --> 02:49:02.287]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[02:49:03.027 --> 02:49:10.349]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:13.365 --> 02:49:18.347]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:18.807 --> 02:49:22.308]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:22.668 --> 02:49:25.189]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:25.249 --> 02:49:26.389]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:26.409 --> 02:49:27.169]  They're not after money.
[02:49:27.189 --> 02:49:28.290]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:28.490 --> 02:49:29.230]  They're after power.
[02:49:29.450 --> 02:49:30.310]  That's what they're after.

[02:49:47.257 --> 02:49:50.039]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:50.299 --> 02:49:54.441]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:54.882 --> 02:49:55.722]  So what do you do?
[02:49:56.022 --> 02:50:00.605]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:50:01.085 --> 02:50:03.227]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:50:44.196 --> 02:50:47.517]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[02:50:47.857 --> 02:50:54.780]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:50:55.140 --> 02:51:07.625]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[02:51:07.865 --> 02:51:10.506]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[02:51:10.846 --> 02:51:17.048]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[02:51:17.269 --> 02:51:22.411]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[02:51:22.671 --> 02:51:30.914]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[02:51:31.134 --> 02:51:31.774]  And the best part?
[02:51:31.994 --> 02:51:33.995]  My listeners pay absolutely nothing today.
[02:51:34.255 --> 02:51:36.837]  Simply go to 321relief.com or call 815-259-4552 for details.
[02:52:11.078 --> 02:52:14.300]  It's a multi-pronged attack against the New World Order.
[02:52:17.583 --> 02:52:19.345]  It's a multi-faceted system.
[02:52:20.366 --> 02:52:21.287]  On the Internet, it's great.
[02:52:21.307 --> 02:52:27.432]  YouTube, Google, Facebook, Myspace, Dig, hit them, hit them hard, Wikipedia, getting the truth out, getting the info out.
[02:52:27.752 --> 02:52:32.957]  But then we have to manifest that in the physical world, and that's happening on the streets all over the planet.
[02:52:33.943 --> 02:52:36.964]  British military reports they're worried about the U.S.
[02:52:37.024 --> 02:52:37.764]  and people waking up.
[02:52:37.784 --> 02:52:38.624]  They're openly saying it.
[02:52:39.184 --> 02:52:42.065]  They're having congressional hearings in Congress.
[02:52:42.785 --> 02:52:43.725]  They're getting scared.
[02:52:43.805 --> 02:52:45.586]  They know we know who they are now.
[02:52:46.186 --> 02:52:48.527]  We need to expand the number of people that are awake.
[02:52:48.827 --> 02:52:49.927]  I'm told Craig in D.C.
[02:52:49.947 --> 02:52:51.787]  disagrees with me and we'll try to cram Sean in.
[02:52:51.807 --> 02:52:54.868]  We're going to go to them in 60 seconds.
[02:52:54.908 --> 02:52:58.609]  First off though, my friends, I want you to listen to me very, very carefully.
[02:53:00.163 --> 02:53:04.791]  The globalists have and will use food as a weapon with all these uncertain times going on.
[02:53:04.832 --> 02:53:09.720]  We've gotten you the longest continual operating storable foods company in the nation, 26 plus years.
[02:53:11.289 --> 02:53:12.910]  They are the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[02:53:13.070 --> 02:53:15.332]  eFoodsDirect.com is the website.
[02:53:15.452 --> 02:53:19.014]  Huge banners on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[02:53:19.054 --> 02:53:20.895]  You cannot miss the sponsor.
[02:53:20.936 --> 02:53:25.378]  Get at least a two-month supply that lasts more than 10 years per person in your family.
[02:53:25.699 --> 02:53:28.521]  Have that in the attic, have it in the garage, have it as a backup.
[02:53:28.541 --> 02:53:33.024]  These are freeze-dried foods, so it's a ton of food in very small containers.
[02:53:33.084 --> 02:53:34.064]  Or get a year's supply.
[02:53:34.465 --> 02:53:35.305]  Give them a call.
[02:53:35.325 --> 02:53:35.385]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:53:35.405 --> 02:53:35.465]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:53:42.330 --> 02:53:44.771]  Or go to efoodsdirect.com.
[02:53:44.831 --> 02:53:45.351]  Don't wait.
[02:53:45.411 --> 02:53:47.673]  The Globalist will and have used food as a weapon.
[02:53:47.953 --> 02:53:48.954]  You need to get prepared.
[02:53:49.914 --> 02:53:51.715]  Let's go ahead and go to Craig in D.C.
[02:53:51.775 --> 02:53:52.616]  Craig, you're on the air.
[02:53:52.656 --> 02:53:53.056]  Go ahead.
[02:53:53.076 --> 02:53:54.417]  Hi, Alex.
[02:53:54.737 --> 02:53:54.937]  Hi.
[02:53:54.957 --> 02:53:59.940]  I called you a few weeks ago, and I did disagree with you back then.
[02:53:59.960 --> 02:54:01.261]  I thought you were overstating things.
[02:54:01.321 --> 02:54:03.242]  I don't know if you remember my call.
[02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:06.790]  I'm told you disagree about Endgame.
[02:54:06.890 --> 02:54:08.971]  No, no, no, no.
[02:54:09.231 --> 02:54:16.052]  I have watched Endgame and I've watched Terrorstorm and... Well, let's be clear.
[02:54:16.152 --> 02:54:17.392]  Let me stop you.
[02:54:17.412 --> 02:54:17.912]  Let me stop you.
[02:54:18.272 --> 02:54:19.273]  I don't screen calls.
[02:54:19.693 --> 02:54:22.853]  If people volunteer things, then I'm told what you said or it's put on the screen.
[02:54:22.873 --> 02:54:25.754]  Because you said something about Endgame, so that's why I said that.
[02:54:25.974 --> 02:54:27.634]  Just go ahead and make your point.
[02:54:28.414 --> 02:54:31.555]  My point is that when I watched Endgame, it shocked me.
[02:54:31.875 --> 02:54:32.775]  I looked up
[02:54:33.442 --> 02:54:36.285]  On the Internet, some of the stories, I found out that they were true.
[02:54:36.805 --> 02:54:42.070]  And I found out that what you were saying before, what I heard you saying on your radio show, wasn't overstated.
[02:54:42.130 --> 02:54:45.012]  In fact, it seems like it's worse than what you're saying.
[02:54:47.094 --> 02:54:57.943]  And all I can say is I've been woken up to a lot of things, and I've been telling my friends and family members, and we're in serious trouble.
[02:54:58.163 --> 02:54:59.384]  It's got me...
[02:55:02.031 --> 02:55:04.913]  You know, when it hit home, it had me shaking inside.
[02:55:05.213 --> 02:55:07.074]  Craig, that's how I am every day.
[02:55:07.134 --> 02:55:09.855]  Welcome to the club, and I'm glad you took the challenge and checked it out.
[02:55:10.215 --> 02:55:12.536]  What specifically did you spot check from endgame?
[02:55:14.057 --> 02:55:27.303]  Well, what I was looking up on the internet was about the global taxation for the carbon taxes, and I found out that a lot of these people that are behind these
[02:55:28.588 --> 02:55:34.638]  Uh, these, these taxes, or, you know, these carbon taxes or whatever, they're also for population reduction.
[02:55:34.718 --> 02:55:35.740]  It's all the same thing.
[02:55:35.820 --> 02:55:36.982]  It's all the same group, yeah.
[02:55:37.783 --> 02:55:41.589]  They want to reduce the population, and that's, uh, that's scary stuff.
[02:55:43.675 --> 02:55:44.576]  Well, do me a favor.
[02:55:44.596 --> 02:55:46.557]  Write up your experience and send it to us.
[02:55:46.577 --> 02:55:49.559]  We'd like to post listeners' reviews of Endgame, the good, bad, and ugly.
[02:55:49.599 --> 02:55:50.400]  We'll post them all.
[02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:52.942]  And send them to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:52.982 --> 02:55:53.442]  I'm out of here.
[02:55:53.462 --> 02:55:56.544]  Call me back another day, Craig, and tell me more things you checked out.
[02:55:56.925 --> 02:55:58.746]  Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.
[02:55:59.707 --> 02:56:02.949]  We have a criminal global government that's in control of our government.
[02:56:03.610 --> 02:56:05.191]  They're setting up a police state.
[02:56:05.751 --> 02:56:06.931]  I'm not overstating.
[02:56:07.031 --> 02:56:11.213]  I've just done the research, and believe me, this is hardcore serious.
[02:56:11.653 --> 02:56:13.233]  Sorry to Sean and others, we're just out of time.
[02:56:13.293 --> 02:56:15.934]  I'll be back live tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central.
[02:56:16.434 --> 02:56:18.955]  If you missed any of the first hour, it was power-packed info.
[02:56:18.995 --> 02:56:21.516]  It restarts right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:21.736 --> 02:56:23.156]  Go to InfoWars.com.
