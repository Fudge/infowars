[00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:09.447]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.107 --> 00:00:10.948]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:12.569]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.911]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:21.493]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.113 --> 00:00:32.954]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:32.994 --> 00:00:33.154]  Welcome.
[00:00:33.254 --> 00:00:34.715]  It is the 8th day of October 2007.
[00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:36.957]  And we're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:37.017 --> 00:00:40.820]  No guests today because I want to be able to cover the news that is in front of me.
[00:00:59.053 --> 00:01:02.136]  This news is not in its order of significance.
[00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:03.357]  It's all important, though.
[00:01:03.777 --> 00:01:10.903]  City passes camera law that all new developments have to have cameras spying on the public.
[00:01:11.444 --> 00:01:14.847]  That's in Baltimore, Maryland, a suburb, Aberdeen.
[00:01:16.668 --> 00:01:22.553]  Remember, two years ago, the Houston Police Chief proposed cameras in everyone's homes.
[00:01:22.713 --> 00:01:24.695]  It's actually happening.
[00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.220]  Britain on board for U.S.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.760]  strikes on Iran.
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.960]  Huge news.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.241]  Madeleine Albright says war may happen.
[00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:33.821]  Get ready.
[00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:40.823]  Police track down the deputy who killed six people, injured another.
[00:01:40.843 --> 00:01:48.485]  I've got an example of disinfo against myself out on the web, and I only cover this because it's educational.
[00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:50.526]  Doesn't bother me when I get attacked.
[00:01:54.065 --> 00:01:55.246]  Well, things like this do.
[00:01:56.486 --> 00:02:02.109]  Some things don't bother me when it's so ridiculous, but when they misrepresent things like this, it just makes me angry.
[00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.870]  I'm going to cover that.
[00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.372]  Congressman Ron Paul, dollar could collapse to absolute zero.
[00:02:08.853 --> 00:02:12.975]  Presidential candidate Ron Paul warns of coming global economic depression.
[00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:14.496]  He did that Friday here.
[00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:16.477]  The article's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:16.857 --> 00:02:19.078]  And the news here is the denial.
[00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:22.940]  There are people on the DIG link, the message board link,
[00:02:24.213 --> 00:02:26.714]  Saying, oh, look at Ron Paul and his fear-mongering.
[00:02:27.755 --> 00:02:33.837]  Hey, the dollar has been devalued by more than 60% against the euro's opening.
[00:02:36.178 --> 00:02:41.301]  42% if you don't even count the euro that opened at 80.
[00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:44.042]  If you count the euro opening at 1 to 1.
[00:02:45.983 --> 00:02:50.585]  If you don't think that's already plunging, you fools, I don't know what will wake you up.
[00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:51.705]  I mean, that's what makes me mad.
[00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:53.446]  You guys are in denial!
[00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.710]  I'm just sick of it!
[00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:02.172]  Our enemies are destroying this country, and you can't even recognize it!
[00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:09.395]  If you don't think 60% reduction in value, 62% is big, you just are an idiot.
[00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:10.676]  That's all I can say to you.
[00:03:12.117 --> 00:03:13.817]  And here's another one today, Gulf News.
[00:03:13.897 --> 00:03:15.798]  Gulf funds drift away from the dollar.
[00:03:16.198 --> 00:03:17.379]  Continual slide.
[00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.720]  I mean, this is just mayday bad.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.402]  And you tell a slack-jawed New Yorker on that, and they just giggle mindlessly.
[00:03:25.863 --> 00:03:28.824]  FBI puts anti-war protesters on criminal database.
[00:03:28.884 --> 00:03:31.165]  Canada uses it to ban protesters from entry.
[00:03:33.165 --> 00:03:36.946]  I'm going to spend some time on the Browns today, the bottom of the hour.
[00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:39.067]  I may even do it in the next segment.
[00:03:39.107 --> 00:03:39.887]  This is important.
[00:03:40.528 --> 00:03:44.589]  But I'm not going to restate my position on it over and over and over again every time I get a call about it.
[00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.390]  It's a complex issue and I'm going to flesh out where I stand on it.
[00:03:49.824 --> 00:03:53.185]  I want to tie it in to four-month trial ends with no convictions.
[00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:56.606]  Federal income tax evasion case involved nine defendants.
[00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:01.788]  Tommy Cryer found not guilty of tax evasion as well.
[00:04:02.228 --> 00:04:03.629]  Joe Bannister, many others.
[00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:06.850]  Back to the war news.
[00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.272]  Feynman, Intel Community, to release three IRAC reports to slow down Bush's warmongering.
[00:04:15.193 --> 00:04:18.614]  IRAC panel, Blackwater Guard, should face murder charges
[00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:29.939]  And when I heard this last night, I said, I bet tomorrow this will be the news that the Iraqi government wants them to face charges, and not that the Army said Blackwater should face charges.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.720]  And they're not.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.341]  The media's not covering that today.
[00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:35.643]  It's all those dirty Iraqi liars.
[00:04:36.723 --> 00:04:38.264]  No, it's the Army.
[00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:43.328]  The Army is saying they should stand trial.
[00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.740]  U.S.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.745]  to launch $1 billion plan for Mexico.
[00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:55.393]  Mobile phone cancer risk higher for children.
[00:04:56.414 --> 00:04:59.139]  More signs the Bush people are preparing for President Hillary Clinton.
[00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.599]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.012 --> 00:05:11.100]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:22.571]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:28.456]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:05:28.456 --> 00:05:28.616]  I think?
[00:05:46.954 --> 00:05:48.597]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[00:05:48.637 --> 00:05:49.498]  Call New Millennium, 888-03-4438.
[00:05:49.538 --> 00:05:49.839]  That's 888-03-4438.
[00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:51.301]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:04.532]  It's here!
[00:06:04.753 --> 00:06:09.561]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:09.901 --> 00:06:17.534]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.228 --> 00:06:25.291]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.691 --> 00:06:37.076]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.416 --> 00:06:40.978]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.358 --> 00:06:43.279]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:47.501]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:08.793]  Hi, I'm David, and if you wake up at night to urinate like I was, then you'll want to take advantage of this special risk-free offer.
[00:07:09.013 --> 00:07:17.018]  If you have dribbling, burning, or pain during or after urination, then you may have a condition known as benign prostate enlargement.
[00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:26.765]  This is potentially serious and can get worse with age, so get regular checkups from your doctor and take advantage of this special risk-free offer on Beta Prostate.
[00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:31.388]  Beta Prostate contains natural ingredients that help support a healthy prostate.
[00:07:31.408 --> 00:07:31.748]  I think?
[00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:07.322]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.903 --> 00:08:28.492]  Britain on board for US strikes on Iran, London Telegraph.
[00:08:30.825 --> 00:08:34.666]  We're going to get into this deputy going in and killing six people, wounding another.
[00:08:35.927 --> 00:08:45.350]  And the families are in the AP saying, we can't understand how a police officer could do this.
[00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.390]  How did he get on the force?
[00:08:49.411 --> 00:08:55.533]  Cops are drawn from the same pool as the general public is.
[00:08:55.853 --> 00:08:58.654]  They're not angels from heaven.
[00:09:00.342 --> 00:09:03.745]  Some of them are really wonderful, great, honorable people.
[00:09:03.825 --> 00:09:07.008]  Some of them are just mediocre, trying to get a paycheck, lazy.
[00:09:08.049 --> 00:09:09.450]  Others are control freaks.
[00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:11.452]  Others are criminals.
[00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:15.476]  I mean, that's just the way reality is.
[00:09:18.358 --> 00:09:26.746]  And that's why the founding fathers said, don't let government get total power and control over you, because in every case, they will rape you.
[00:09:28.101 --> 00:09:37.406]  You may have a good leadership in at first when you get a dictatorship, but over time you will get a despot, and they will use those levers.
[00:09:38.827 --> 00:09:46.492]  And of course, 99 times out of 100, it is a despotism that takes over and sets up the centralized system to begin with.
[00:09:47.312 --> 00:09:48.773]  I'm already digressing off into that.
[00:09:48.833 --> 00:09:52.115]  It's just how naive the public is.
[00:09:53.254 --> 00:10:05.318]  I mean, I see it in the papers every day, where cops are getting busted for bank robbery, cops are getting busted for armed robbery, cops are getting busted for killing their wives, killing their neighbors, killing people at bars.
[00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:11.360]  Statistically, more than the general public, because they get habitualized to the use of force.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:17.922]  They get used to being able to use that force and getting away with it, whether it's in proper or improper areas.
[00:10:19.324 --> 00:10:32.930]  And so some guy smarts off to them in a bar, they get in a fist fight, they start losing, or they get mad and they just pull that handgun they've got on their side, or they pull it off their ankle and they blow them away.
[00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:39.093]  I mean, I see it every single day.
[00:10:39.153 --> 00:10:46.657]  Statistically, police have a many, many times higher chance of being involved in crime.
[00:10:48.146 --> 00:10:51.829]  Polices are all federal numbers, by the way, which are even whitewashes.
[00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:54.791]  It's much worse from what I see in the news compared to what the numbers are.
[00:10:55.912 --> 00:11:05.780]  They are many times more likely to be involved in embezzlement, involved in kickbacks, involved in predatory action on women and children.
[00:11:06.741 --> 00:11:14.908]  Now, it's still a very low number, but smart criminals, smart rapists, smart
[00:11:15.913 --> 00:11:22.637]  Smart torturers, smart pedophiles, smart criminals go and get a badge and a gun.
[00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:26.019]  Or they go become a city council member.
[00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:28.480]  They're seeking power.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.341]  Alright, later I'm going to walk through more of this.
[00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:32.743]  It's just, it's an unbelievable buffet of news here.
[00:11:34.104 --> 00:11:36.985]  Cities passing laws, they want cameras in your houses.
[00:11:37.005 --> 00:11:39.286]  I mean, it's just, it's all out of control.
[00:11:41.448 --> 00:11:42.829]  It's completely freaking me out.
[00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:45.050]  Ron Paul talking about total dollar collapse.
[00:11:46.616 --> 00:11:48.998]  News of that in the press.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.562]  Let me just go ahead and cover the Browns right now.
[00:11:53.662 --> 00:11:54.723]  Let me just do this right now.
[00:11:59.847 --> 00:12:04.111]  And then we'll open the phones up and you're welcome to talk about the Browns getting grabbed last Thursday.
[00:12:04.671 --> 00:12:15.260]  The economy, the build-up for war in Iran, this cop, the sheriff's deputy, going in and gunning all these people down, showing them who the boss is.
[00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:23.215]  I was on Coast to Coast AM last night and then got all jacked up from being on there and come to bed at about four in the morning.
[00:12:23.255 --> 00:12:25.776]  I'm a little out of it today.
[00:12:25.796 --> 00:12:27.877]  So just give me a moment to drink my coffee here.
[00:12:28.657 --> 00:12:30.218]  This Dag Blasted Allergies.
[00:12:30.778 --> 00:12:35.841]  I'm in the phase now with the cedar and the oak and the pollen flying around here in Austin where it just coats my lungs.
[00:12:36.641 --> 00:12:41.363]  So I'm even more raspy and have to pause every few seconds to cough.
[00:12:44.744 --> 00:12:46.105]  Ah, life before allergies.
[00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:48.131]  Hmm.
[00:12:49.753 --> 00:12:50.173]  Alrighty.
[00:12:51.314 --> 00:12:53.276]  Let me get into the Browns right now.
[00:12:53.296 --> 00:13:15.355]  I tried to give the Browns political support, and by that, when the Feds were going to rush in there with their armored vehicles and their guys dressed up in ghillie suits and camouflage, clearly to do a Waco-style raid, I said, that is criminal,
[00:13:16.804 --> 00:13:19.106]  You shouldn't go in there violently against those people.
[00:13:19.626 --> 00:13:22.989]  They're convicted of a non-violent crime that is a non-crime.
[00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:27.053]  And we need to end this peacefully.
[00:13:31.516 --> 00:13:44.007]  And I admired Ed Delane Brown's courage and their stoic will to face what appeared to be certain death at the hands of the federal government.
[00:13:47.466 --> 00:14:16.716]  But when the Browns started talking about, when Ed started talking about how he would shoot into the woods if he saw anything moving, I privately told him, I said, Ed, a lot of people publicly said on air, Ed, you don't want to talk like that because then, and I did say this later on air, the Feds then can come right up into the edge of the woods and just, if they want to, sniper you.
[00:14:17.575 --> 00:14:20.276]  And then say, well, because of your statements, we had to.
[00:14:20.376 --> 00:14:31.860]  He was threatening to kill anybody that came close, including somebody walking their dog, kids from the nearby neighborhoods that could be going to the woods.
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:39.062]  I know I did that as a young man, as a teenager, and when I was 10 years old, we'd walk around all day.
[00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:54.911]  I grew up on the edge of Dallas, but there were still, when I was growing up, areas, there were still some farms left right in the middle of suburbia, and we'd go walk around and see people's horses and cows and get down in creek bottoms, and I said, Ed, listen, you're escalating this.
[00:14:54.991 --> 00:14:57.473]  You don't want to say you're just shooting into the woods.
[00:14:58.254 --> 00:15:02.778]  The feds are less apt to come in there if you don't talk like that, and they could back off and leave you alone.
[00:15:02.838 --> 00:15:03.939]  This could kind of be forgotten.
[00:15:04.984 --> 00:15:09.448]  Like the Gray family in East Texas, who now have been holed up.
[00:15:09.688 --> 00:15:12.150]  I'm told they're just basically left alone now and work in the community.
[00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.092]  It was just quietly left alone.
[00:15:15.733 --> 00:15:16.474]  Eight years later.
[00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:18.275]  This started in 1999.
[00:15:20.157 --> 00:15:25.721]  And I said, but talking about spraying gunfire into the woods, you're inviting people on the land.
[00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:27.343]  A lot of them get walking in.
[00:15:27.483 --> 00:15:28.463]  That's dangerous.
[00:15:30.405 --> 00:15:33.027]  And Ed didn't want to listen to me.
[00:15:33.047 --> 00:15:33.768]  And then I said, Ed,
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:43.826]  You're having all these people on your property, and I said this on air, I said, what's going to happen is the feds are going to surround you one day, posing as your buddies, and then they're going to pull guns out and put them to your head.
[00:15:45.107 --> 00:15:46.508]  Oh, no, that's not going to happen.
[00:15:47.268 --> 00:15:48.509]  They can't do that to me.
[00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.451]  We've got contingency plans.
[00:15:51.491 --> 00:15:59.897]  And I said, yeah, you probably got plans that are going to get you and your wife killed, and that are going to get some of those people killed, some of the feds, and then that'll make them martyrs.
[00:16:00.999 --> 00:16:04.861]  And I said, that may be what you want, but I really don't think we need that in this country right now.
[00:16:05.682 --> 00:16:07.283]  Oh, you're talking just like one of them.
[00:16:07.303 --> 00:16:10.845]  Ed, please listen to me.
[00:16:15.962 --> 00:16:17.302]  Stop escalating this.
[00:16:17.782 --> 00:16:23.864]  I said, when you have parties out there, it's one thing to have political rallies and speak out and say, leave us alone.
[00:16:24.264 --> 00:16:29.965]  But when you taunt them with parties, they will use that in the media to make it look like you're taunting the public.
[00:16:30.285 --> 00:16:31.565]  They will misrepresent that.
[00:16:31.585 --> 00:16:33.986]  I'm talking about basic strategy here in politics.
[00:16:34.566 --> 00:16:36.486]  And they will demonize you.
[00:16:37.486 --> 00:16:39.047]  And they will use it against you.
[00:16:39.767 --> 00:16:40.927]  No, no, whatever.
[00:16:46.249 --> 00:16:52.652]  I mean, I didn't just fall off the, uh, turnip truck, the watermelon truck last week, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:53.592 --> 00:16:55.913]  I was born in the dark, but it wasn't last night.
[00:16:57.274 --> 00:17:12.201]  And I have seen hundreds of people festooned in camouflage and medals and announcing themselves admirals because they had a bass boat and running around calling themselves generals because they had, you know, two dumb cousins that followed them and saluted them.
[00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:19.061]  I mean, I've literally had people strutting around Texas walk up to me in meetings and say, you must salute the President.
[00:17:19.462 --> 00:17:21.405]  I mean, this is just out-of-control nuttery.
[00:17:22.988 --> 00:17:24.712]  And it makes our movement look bad.
[00:17:25.612 --> 00:17:27.234]  Again, I respect the Browns.
[00:17:27.434 --> 00:17:28.536]  I pray for the Browns.
[00:17:28.676 --> 00:17:30.538]  They need to be released from jail.
[00:17:30.578 --> 00:17:31.959]  They need to have a fair trial.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:43.052]  I'm going to get Larry Becraft and other top lawyers, constitutional scholars, not quacks, on who actually get people found not guilty and get mistrials and get retrials.
[00:17:43.112 --> 00:17:45.275]  I'm going to have him on sometime this week and others.
[00:17:48.078 --> 00:17:49.899]  Because they clearly didn't get a fair trial.
[00:17:50.479 --> 00:17:52.360]  They should get a new trial.
[00:17:52.541 --> 00:17:55.982]  That conviction in absentia, it's not a real trial.
[00:17:57.163 --> 00:18:03.547]  By any stretch, by the entire body of precedent.
[00:18:06.068 --> 00:18:14.573]  And from that point on, as long as they were peaceful out there, and didn't talk about a bunch of violence, and didn't let provocateurs sass them up,
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:34.664]  And to saying a bunch of things and shooting their mouths off, while it was all being recorded by the way, you can guarantee that, that they could have delicately played this and ended up getting out of jail in a couple of years like Nelson Mandela and been iconic heroes.
[00:18:36.385 --> 00:18:42.226]  Instead they played it exactly wrong with all the experts leading them down into oblivion
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:59.215]  There's a lot of other people who sit around, a lot of other cornballs and people, who want to see shootouts, who want to see martial law in this country, who constantly shirt on their websites and their radio shows, guaranteed they're feds, most of them.
[00:18:59.575 --> 00:19:06.902]  I mean, you don't get on the air and say, kill feds, murder this and that, do this and that, over and over again, and not be arrested if you're not a fed.
[00:19:08.439 --> 00:19:09.160]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:16.865]  They're provocateuring everywhere, as much as they can, desperately trying to get some type of violent clash.
[00:19:17.125 --> 00:19:33.617]  Now, I'm not saying Monier, the head federal marshal, is doing that out there in that district, because he's compartmentalized, but there are definitely those in the strata, leading back to Defense Department, FBI, no doubt, and others that are playing this like a fiddle.
[00:19:34.458 --> 00:19:35.559]  Now, I'm going to walk through
[00:19:37.071 --> 00:19:49.099]  How we can try to navigate this, and you can take my advice, or you can put a general hat on and festoon yourself with some medals you buy at the Army-Navy store and tell me to go jump in Hades.
[00:19:50.259 --> 00:19:56.043]  But I'll try to break this down, this very dangerous situation, when we get back.
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.566]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:14.795]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:20:15.056 --> 00:20:22.104]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:20:22.244 --> 00:20:23.205]  We're good to go!
[00:20:49.466 --> 00:20:49.786]  We're good.
[00:21:01.787 --> 00:21:13.294]  Ted Anders from Midas October 8 2007 gold 735 60 ounce gold coins can be purchased for 758 47 374 per half 187 per quarter that's 758 47 374 and 187.
[00:21:14.394 --> 00:21:16.616]  The dollar has fallen to 65 percent of the euro.
[00:21:16.696 --> 00:21:17.736]  Erosion accelerates.
[00:21:17.837 --> 00:21:25.221]  Mainline talk show hosts are trying to hold on to their support of the conservative movement keeping focus on the republican agenda and playing into the hand of the globalists.
[00:21:25.341 --> 00:21:27.082]  Dr. Corsi interviewed Robert Past
[00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:27.522]  I think so.
[00:21:48.063 --> 00:21:49.945]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.045 --> 00:21:53.309]  The value of your hard earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[00:21:53.429 --> 00:21:53.710]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:53.910]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.139 --> 00:22:04.180]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:13.742]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not directly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.182 --> 00:22:21.384]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.111 --> 00:22:27.597]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:22:39.671 --> 00:22:41.694]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:22:45.055 --> 00:22:45.396]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:23:01.398 --> 00:23:03.239]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.563]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:23:08.743 --> 00:23:10.084]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:23:10.344 --> 00:23:18.549]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:18.749 --> 00:23:24.473]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:26.415]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:26.495 --> 00:23:28.657]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:28.797 --> 00:23:33.042]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:33.202 --> 00:23:35.364]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:23:35.444 --> 00:23:42.792]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:23:44.349 --> 00:23:44.789]  I think so.
[00:24:16.848 --> 00:24:27.192]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to suspend right now my discussion of how all this unfolded and how I would have handled it
[00:24:29.469 --> 00:24:49.125]  But Sean Kradish, for quite a long while, has run one of the websites for Ed and Elaine Brown, and he's worried that Ed has not been enrolled in the Bureau of Prisons' in-custody system, and he's been in custody now for three plus days, three and a half, almost four days.
[00:24:50.126 --> 00:24:51.527]  That is not normal.
[00:24:52.148 --> 00:24:54.830]  And the question is, is he being given diesel treatment?
[00:24:55.611 --> 00:24:57.172]  Dieseling is where they put you
[00:24:58.334 --> 00:25:03.135]  A lot of times strapped in a sitting position until your toes pop.
[00:25:03.755 --> 00:25:06.996]  That's what happens after 3, 4, 5 days being forced to sit.
[00:25:07.476 --> 00:25:08.596]  The blood in your feet.
[00:25:09.416 --> 00:25:13.537]  And Congressman Hanson spoke out against the IRS back in the 80's.
[00:25:13.977 --> 00:25:15.057]  And I've got the news articles.
[00:25:15.077 --> 00:25:16.277]  I've interviewed Congressman Hanson.
[00:25:16.297 --> 00:25:17.437]  I've seen video interviews with him.
[00:25:17.837 --> 00:25:18.538]  And the photos.
[00:25:19.078 --> 00:25:20.258]  They knocked his teeth out.
[00:25:20.338 --> 00:25:21.538]  Beat him from head to toe.
[00:25:21.558 --> 00:25:22.258]  He didn't resist.
[00:25:22.678 --> 00:25:26.839]  They de-sealed him for two weeks until he basically went into a coma.
[00:25:27.865 --> 00:25:28.686]  We're good to go.
[00:25:49.492 --> 00:25:51.753]  I think Homeland Security has him now and they love to torture.
[00:25:51.813 --> 00:25:55.855]  They watch Jack Bauer and it's an imaginary world and then they put that template over U.S.
[00:25:55.875 --> 00:25:56.315]  citizens.
[00:25:56.855 --> 00:26:06.779]  But if he doesn't show up in prison soon and in the custody rolls, then we know that probably the worst is going on.
[00:26:06.839 --> 00:26:10.020]  So right now, it's very suspicious he could be under torture.
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.241]  Because they'll torture sitting Congressmen.
[00:26:13.115 --> 00:26:16.938]  I mean, they'll torture him, they'll beat him, they'll trap him down until their feet pop.
[00:26:17.138 --> 00:26:24.803]  Every toe popped open and spewed purple blood, black blood, from the moment his shoes swole up and basically popped open.
[00:26:25.404 --> 00:26:26.945]  And that's how they pleasure themselves.
[00:26:27.565 --> 00:26:29.767]  And believe me, the demons will be torturing them in hell.
[00:26:30.728 --> 00:26:31.708]  But they don't believe in hell.
[00:26:32.049 --> 00:26:36.412]  Sean Kradish, you believe he's going to Ohio.
[00:26:36.512 --> 00:26:39.514]  We know that Elaine is enrolled.
[00:26:39.534 --> 00:26:40.975]  When was she enrolled in Danbury?
[00:26:42.253 --> 00:26:46.136]  Um, as far as I know, she was enrolled, um, I believe Saturday.
[00:26:46.156 --> 00:26:47.737]  I think that's when it first came up.
[00:26:47.757 --> 00:26:51.760]  I could be wrong on that, but she, she... Okay, she is enrolling.
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.141]  How did you discover that?
[00:26:53.461 --> 00:26:54.182]  Give us the intel.
[00:26:54.442 --> 00:27:09.553]  Well, yes, some of our members on makethestand.com, that's our website, um, just did some Bureau of Prison searches on the internet, um, with her name and everything, and came up with her inmate number and where she's located, so... Give us her inmate number.
[00:27:09.573 --> 00:27:10.514]  Do you have that in front of you?
[00:27:11.355 --> 00:27:12.595]  Yeah, actually I do.
[00:27:12.615 --> 00:27:14.076]  Let me pull that up for you really quick.
[00:27:15.376 --> 00:27:20.458]  Yeah, it's important to have that all on the record because, again, I didn't want the Browns to be killed.
[00:27:20.658 --> 00:27:21.918]  I didn't want them to be arrested.
[00:27:22.218 --> 00:27:24.159]  It was an unarrestable offense.
[00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:26.059]  The private banks wanted their money.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:37.903]  The public is now learning of this no matter what the criminals do, but then he put it into another ballpark with all the talk of revenge and killings and the rest of it.
[00:27:38.862 --> 00:27:46.888]  Uh, which I did not support, but then now if they torture him, it goes right back into them being completely in the wrong, and this is just absolutely horrible.
[00:27:46.908 --> 00:27:47.969]  Do you have her inmate number now?
[00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:49.951]  Yeah, her registered number is 03924-049.
[00:27:49.971 --> 00:27:52.252]  Um, that's as far as we can tell.
[00:27:52.413 --> 00:27:58.277]  That's within the system, so... We ought to find out what pastor is a, um...
[00:28:04.292 --> 00:28:06.814]  I mean, I'm pretty confident that they are doing something.
[00:28:07.034 --> 00:28:08.234]  There's no reason at all to cart them around.
[00:28:08.354 --> 00:28:14.378]  There's no reason not to hand them over to the Bureau of Prisons right away like they said they would.
[00:28:34.782 --> 00:28:38.246]  Um, you know, why, why hasn't he shown up in the system yet?
[00:28:38.286 --> 00:28:43.011]  Why, when you, when you do a search for his name, it says, not in Bureau of Prisons Custody.
[00:28:43.031 --> 00:28:45.374]  Well, I think with that piece of... But Marshall still have him.
[00:28:45.694 --> 00:28:48.036]  Yeah, not, not yet in Bureau of Prisons Custody.
[00:28:48.097 --> 00:28:51.981]  That little piece of evidence, coming up on four days in their clutches,
[00:28:52.601 --> 00:29:04.068]  They're probably, I'd say 9 times out of 10, 90% chance, they're torturing him more than just dieseling to quote, find out who the secret teams are that are going to come after him.
[00:29:04.448 --> 00:29:14.214]  And I think much of that was just bravado and talk, which the feds should be smart enough to know, but by torturing him, it's just horrible.
[00:29:14.915 --> 00:29:26.942]  Well yeah, it needs to stop and what we're asking people to do is to give the marshals in New Hampshire a call and try to see what's going on and ask about Ed.
[00:29:27.622 --> 00:29:33.406]  Well also, not just the marshals, the national media, the local media.
[00:29:35.267 --> 00:29:36.527]  Is this a rendition?
[00:29:36.768 --> 00:29:38.008]  I mean basically that's what it is.
[00:29:38.048 --> 00:29:38.969]  He's disappeared.
[00:29:40.362 --> 00:29:42.803]  According to your report, into a black hole.
[00:29:42.863 --> 00:29:44.144]  Sean Kradish, stay with us.
[00:29:44.664 --> 00:29:48.946]  Are we going to let citizens disappear into black holes?
[00:29:49.507 --> 00:29:50.147]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.047 --> 00:29:52.028]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.048 --> 00:29:54.049]  The empire's on the run.

[00:31:01.836 --> 00:31:03.016]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:31:03.116 --> 00:31:05.417]  of the Nuclear Medical Report here on Genesis.

[00:32:04.213 --> 00:32:07.477]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[00:32:07.957 --> 00:32:11.382]  Hemp, used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[00:32:11.742 --> 00:32:18.831]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:32:19.171 --> 00:32:22.415]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[00:32:22.695 --> 00:32:26.539]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[00:32:26.879 --> 00:32:37.991]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.

[00:33:08.926 --> 00:33:12.487]  Alright, Sean Kradish, I was interrogating you there and you couldn't answer any questions.
[00:33:13.368 --> 00:33:14.248]  You got the floor.
[00:33:15.588 --> 00:33:17.909]  You run their main website.
[00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:21.651]  Give out that address again and then walk through what you know has happened.
[00:33:22.371 --> 00:33:29.973]  Yeah, our site is MakeTheStand.com and it is the official website of Edwin Lane Brown.
[00:33:30.074 --> 00:33:31.594]  It has been for quite some time.
[00:33:32.714 --> 00:33:37.016]  What we've done is we've set up a membership system and a discussion forum.
[00:33:37.977 --> 00:33:41.079]  If you register on there, it just takes a minute, it's free of course.
[00:33:42.239 --> 00:33:45.621]  We can email you as soon as we know of any new developments.
[00:33:45.661 --> 00:33:58.148]  We sent out an alert last night and at the top of the page in our news you can see a link to the Bureau of Prisons website where you can actually do name searches and searches by inmate numbers.
[00:33:59.229 --> 00:34:07.013]  And if you do a search for Edward Brown you'll see that he's 65 or that's what they have him listed as.
[00:34:08.656 --> 00:34:13.742]  White male, and he comes up not in BOP, Bureau of Prisons, custody.
[00:34:14.323 --> 00:34:16.385]  So the marshals or someone else still have them.
[00:34:16.465 --> 00:34:21.451]  We don't know exactly what they're doing, but it doesn't take much imagination.
[00:34:21.992 --> 00:34:27.218]  Because of Ed, how he stood up against him, I guarantee you they are torturing him in some way.
[00:34:28.215 --> 00:34:30.257]  And I'm sure it's not pleasant at all.
[00:34:30.277 --> 00:34:32.219]  They're probably trying to get information out of them.
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:38.206]  Well, most Americans are ignorant about the prison system, but torture is standard in federal hands.
[00:34:39.807 --> 00:34:41.669]  Waterboarding has been done for years.
[00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:48.136]  It's the equivalent with a bag over the head until you start passing out, strangling you.
[00:34:49.182 --> 00:34:49.683]  I don't
[00:35:05.393 --> 00:35:22.692]  Again, I'd say 90% chance because the fact that he hasn't shown up in Bureau of Prison hands, where you have a lot less torture because it's lower level people, it's all surveilled, they can get in more trouble, they've got a claim you've done something to have an excuse to go in and beat you, but to no doubt,
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:23.580]  I don't
[00:35:40.258 --> 00:35:44.220]  I have really no doubt in my gut they're torturing him, but obviously we can't say we're sure.
[00:35:44.981 --> 00:36:02.289]  But the bigger issue here for the local papers, the TV station, who are our best bet to cover this to then springboard to national attention, is that this is exactly what we hear about citizens being grabbed and disappearing into black holes.
[00:36:02.913 --> 00:36:10.440]  And he has disappeared into an almost four-day, tonight at 7 o'clock, 745, it'll be a four-day black hole.
[00:36:11.321 --> 00:36:20.249]  And we need for the feds to show us pictures of Ed, because they've already broken a lot of protocols, a lot of regulations.
[00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:21.330]  I know that for a fact.
[00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:23.972]  We can go look them up, but I've seen the regulations in the past.
[00:36:24.212 --> 00:36:25.834]  We need to double-check those regulations.
[00:36:26.394 --> 00:36:27.455]  They're not allowed to do this.
[00:36:27.495 --> 00:36:29.157]  This is secret police right there.
[00:36:29.737 --> 00:36:38.821]  Yeah, and we don't even know if Ed's alive right now, and I'm not saying anything otherwise, but we don't know what condition he's in, if he's in the hospital.
[00:36:38.941 --> 00:36:46.525]  I mean, all we know right now is the information that they've given us through their media cohorts, and that's not good enough.
[00:36:47.165 --> 00:36:47.665]  Well, you know what?
[00:36:47.745 --> 00:36:48.366]  I agree with you.
[00:36:48.586 --> 00:36:50.307]  They could have... Okay, go ahead.
[00:36:51.923 --> 00:36:54.304]  Um, get a pencil or pen to write this down.
[00:36:54.324 --> 00:36:57.506]  It's 603... And what number is this?
[00:36:57.766 --> 00:36:58.406]  I'm gonna stop you again.
[00:36:58.426 --> 00:36:58.506]  Okay.
[00:36:58.526 --> 00:36:58.646]  Yeah.
[00:36:59.026 --> 00:36:59.967]  I'm gonna have to stop you again.
[00:36:59.987 --> 00:37:00.267]  This is the U.N.
[00:37:00.287 --> 00:37:02.008]  Marshals Office in New Hampshire.
[00:37:02.468 --> 00:37:02.648]  Okay.
[00:37:03.308 --> 00:37:03.869]  Very important.
[00:37:03.889 --> 00:37:03.969]  603-225-1632.
[00:37:03.989 --> 00:37:04.289]  That's 603-225-1632.
[00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:10.211]  Um, that's the office, I'm assuming, where Monier, or Monier, whatever the heck his name is, works.
[00:37:21.153 --> 00:37:22.895]  Um, we need to call them.
[00:37:23.656 --> 00:37:24.557]  Can I say something?
[00:37:24.978 --> 00:37:25.198]  Sure.
[00:37:25.839 --> 00:37:30.204]  It's just my, and you know I'm not that smart, but I just have a recommendation.
[00:37:30.605 --> 00:37:31.606]  It's to call the media.
[00:37:32.264 --> 00:37:44.631]  Because Monier will just put the phones on hold and it'll go to voicemail, and I'm not saying don't try the number, but I personally think that if you get media attention on this, they're going to have to respond.
[00:37:45.011 --> 00:37:53.376]  They will ignore alternative media generally, not that alternative media isn't bigger and more important in reality, but they're still living in the Stone Age.
[00:37:55.054 --> 00:37:56.736]  This is all spur of the moment, Sean.
[00:37:57.256 --> 00:38:00.299]  I don't have any of those numbers in front of me.
[00:38:00.319 --> 00:38:06.284]  Yeah, what we can do is we can post them on the front page at the very top of MakeTheStand.com.
[00:38:06.344 --> 00:38:08.206]  I'll get some of those numbers, some of the local media.
[00:38:08.226 --> 00:38:09.907]  You think the local media is the best?
[00:38:10.407 --> 00:38:13.951]  Only because they have already covered it and are hot on the story.
[00:38:14.371 --> 00:38:15.312]  They are apt.
[00:38:15.872 --> 00:38:16.573]  We can do both.
[00:38:16.693 --> 00:38:20.375]  For everyone sitting at home, or even if you're at work, it doesn't matter.
[00:38:40.328 --> 00:38:48.634]  Call a couple phone numbers, call the Marshal's office, that number we just gave, then look on our website and get the numbers for the media.
[00:38:48.674 --> 00:38:49.474]  Call them really quick.
[00:38:49.894 --> 00:38:51.155]  Express your concerns.
[00:38:51.555 --> 00:38:54.197]  We don't know where Ed is, what condition he's in.
[00:38:54.978 --> 00:39:04.444]  You don't understand why the Marshals haven't put him in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons yet, and they have Elaine, and you're worried that something's very wrong.
[00:39:05.124 --> 00:39:06.266]  And this needs to be looked into.
[00:39:06.286 --> 00:39:08.509]  That's the message we need to get to these people.
[00:39:08.529 --> 00:39:08.970]  You know what?
[00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:10.952]  I'm going to call Larry Becraft.
[00:39:11.313 --> 00:39:12.495]  I'm just telling my producer now.
[00:39:12.575 --> 00:39:20.686]  I was going to get Becraft on the mark because I got all this other news, but go ahead and call Becraft, a constitutional lawyer who's won a lot of cases and graduated top of his class.
[00:39:20.706 --> 00:39:21.407]  I really respect
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:22.961]  Yes, we are.
[00:39:38.744 --> 00:39:42.947]  And if he has disappeared, they will try to follow their own rules.
[00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:46.770]  They probably have him under anti-terrorism guidelines.
[00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:50.853]  He may have even been designated an enemy combatant for all we know.
[00:39:51.594 --> 00:39:53.855]  And this is outrageous if this is the case.
[00:39:53.915 --> 00:39:58.419]  Sean, I want to commend you for what you've done with the fine website that I visit every week.
[00:39:58.439 --> 00:40:03.642]  And I want to thank you for your concern and your courage in supporting Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:40:03.682 --> 00:40:05.904]  Now you've got the floor for anything else you want to say.
[00:40:06.969 --> 00:40:08.030]  That's pretty much it.
[00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:27.601]  We just want people to take 5 minutes, 10 minutes out of their time today to try to help Ed and Elaine because we don't want to see anything... What people have to understand is if they're doing anything bad right now, which it's very likely they are, it can have permanent physical health consequences for the rest of his life.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:36.902]  You know, I don't want to see the guy with scars and nerve damage and toes that will never heal for the rest of his life.
[00:40:37.942 --> 00:40:40.723]  You know, the same kind of stuff that happened to Congressman Hanson.
[00:40:41.443 --> 00:40:42.663]  It's not pretty at all.
[00:40:44.283 --> 00:40:45.744]  So we don't want to see that happen.
[00:40:45.784 --> 00:40:51.745]  We don't want to have Ed go through this kind of torture because it's very bad.
[00:40:51.765 --> 00:40:57.286]  And if we bring this to the light and expose the fact that they haven't put him in the Bureau of Prisons,
[00:40:58.427 --> 00:41:04.829]  I think that's a good thing and we can get this stopped right away.
[00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:14.171]  So please check out MakeTheStand.com and we'll have more information on there, what you can do, and hopefully we can help them out.
[00:41:14.832 --> 00:41:21.533]  Sean, just recap the basic facts of the case, what we know right now, where Elaine is, her number and other things.
[00:41:25.382 --> 00:41:29.767]  Yeah, Elaine right now, as far as we can tell, is in Danbury, Connecticut.
[00:41:30.047 --> 00:41:33.911]  It's a woman's minimal security prison.
[00:41:33.971 --> 00:41:35.753]  Her register number is 03924-049.
[00:41:35.973 --> 00:41:42.980]  And Ed's number looks like it's the same, except it's 03923 instead of 24.
[00:41:52.005 --> 00:41:56.187]  This is outrageous.
[00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:57.248]  This is outrageous.
[00:41:58.009 --> 00:42:01.311]  Sean, let me put you on hold and get your number.
[00:42:01.531 --> 00:42:06.234]  I think I've had it in the past, but I want to stay in contact with you and call in anytime there's new developments.
[00:42:06.314 --> 00:42:06.874]  Okay, Sean?
[00:42:06.894 --> 00:42:07.375]  Okay.
[00:42:07.575 --> 00:42:07.955]  Yeah, great.
[00:42:08.015 --> 00:42:08.455]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:42:08.595 --> 00:42:09.436]  Thank you so much.
[00:42:10.149 --> 00:42:19.633]  Now again, let me walk through this, then we'll take other calls on this subject, and we've got a bunch of other war news, economy news, very serious, what we're looking down the barrel of.
[00:42:19.653 --> 00:42:23.655]  Let me find my specific stories on this.
[00:42:26.676 --> 00:42:36.461]  Again, when the Browns were surrounded by Feds, who clearly were preparing for an assault, armored vehicles, people in ghillie suits, on the perimeter,
[00:42:38.267 --> 00:42:40.328]  All indications of a violent assault.
[00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:42.670]  What do we see at Ruby Ridge?
[00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:46.852]  Well, they shot people in the head, shot people in the back, shot the family dog.
[00:42:47.353 --> 00:42:49.454]  Evidence shows shot their own federal marshal.
[00:42:51.295 --> 00:42:52.236]  Bunch of cowboys.
[00:42:54.077 --> 00:42:55.177]  What do we see at Waco?
[00:42:55.418 --> 00:43:05.924]  Going in, not arresting correction town, wanting to have an event, the BATF, loading their cameras on camera, bragging we'll get lots of funding from this, we're gonna go engage the cult in a shootout.
[00:43:07.867 --> 00:43:08.887]  That's their words for them.
[00:43:10.408 --> 00:43:13.469]  And I went and covered that, and know the Davidians, and documented what really happened.
[00:43:13.489 --> 00:43:18.651]  They sent Delta Force in with infantry, standard maneuvers, to kill everybody inside, kill those children.
[00:43:19.192 --> 00:43:26.235]  And those 2-year-old, and 3-year-old, and 4-year-old, and 5-year-old children, from ages 6 months to 10 years, didn't deserve to die.
[00:43:26.595 --> 00:43:27.275]  Over 30 of them.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.183]  And Monier admitted that they got horrible black eyes from that.
[00:43:35.263 --> 00:43:38.266]  The Feds admitted it energized the public to hate the New World Order.
[00:43:38.786 --> 00:43:40.187]  The New World Order's got a big problem.
[00:43:40.227 --> 00:43:42.229]  I mean, we know who you are, we know what you are.
[00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:47.153]  And so I saw the Feds early on saying, OK, we're not going to do a violent assault.
[00:43:47.674 --> 00:43:48.755]  And I said, that's good.
[00:43:50.256 --> 00:43:52.258]  I didn't necessarily believe what they were saying, but
[00:43:53.476 --> 00:43:57.857]  Monier was saying, in the past, this has really blown up in our face, we don't want this.
[00:43:58.157 --> 00:43:59.237]  That was an admission.
[00:43:59.797 --> 00:44:05.198]  And I'm a pretty good gauge of people, and I think we could have gotten folks more wicked than Monier.
[00:44:05.298 --> 00:44:06.518]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:44:08.139 --> 00:44:09.779]  Okay, I'm trying to be real world here.
[00:44:10.779 --> 00:44:18.381]  And they don't make admissions of things they've done wrong in the past if they're not really concerned.
[00:44:18.401 --> 00:44:20.901]  I mean, a lot of this approach was genuine.
[00:44:21.733 --> 00:44:24.894]  Now, we know Homeland Security then flew around in the helicopter.
[00:44:25.074 --> 00:44:34.078]  They're above the marshals, and I know there's been some infighting within the ranks with the agencies at less than 30 feet below tree level above crowds.
[00:44:34.118 --> 00:44:35.119]  That is so dangerous.
[00:44:35.419 --> 00:44:37.100]  That is total felonies.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.081]  I don't care if you're the feds.
[00:44:39.101 --> 00:44:42.542]  You're not allowed to do that and endanger your pilots, your people in there, and the public.
[00:44:43.342 --> 00:44:43.642]  Okay?
[00:44:44.843 --> 00:44:46.064]  That was macho bravado.
[00:44:46.424 --> 00:44:48.585]  And I said, oh, things are making a turn for the worse.
[00:44:48.625 --> 00:44:49.325]  This is not good.
[00:44:53.462 --> 00:44:57.973]  Conversely, I was not sitting here like a spectator.
[00:44:59.927 --> 00:45:05.391]  In a peanut gallery, wanting to see Edna Wayne Brown die, a lot of people just couldn't wait for the conflagration.
[00:45:05.411 --> 00:45:13.636]  A lot of people are sitting around, oiling their guns, wanting to go out and just blast cops in the streets, and shoot feds, and start World War III.
[00:45:13.716 --> 00:45:15.277]  And let me just tell the feds something.
[00:45:15.717 --> 00:45:27.385]  There are hundreds of thousands of people in this country who aren't just shooting their mouths off, whose mamas you killed in nursing homes, or whose daddies you falsely imprisoned, or whose kids you shot, or sisters you tasered,
[00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:31.030]  I mean, believe me, they want to come out and start killing you.
[00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:32.751]  They want civil war to start.
[00:45:33.651 --> 00:45:34.392]  I don't want that.
[00:45:35.693 --> 00:45:37.654]  And I have my reasons for that, and I can walk through those.
[00:45:37.694 --> 00:45:40.875]  I mean, believe me, the threat is very real.
[00:45:42.556 --> 00:45:44.317]  And you don't
[00:45:45.342 --> 00:45:49.623]  Generally, make it any better, the criminal things the Feds do.
[00:45:49.703 --> 00:46:03.047]  Cooking bombs, training drivers, bombing the World Trade Centers, covering up 9-11, blocking good FBI that tries to stop it, provocateuring, creating Klan groups, trying to get them to blow up chemical plants, all the crimes, murder for hire, the Feds run, all of it!
[00:46:04.407 --> 00:46:07.608]  About 20% of your ranks are hardcore criminals, and they're all the top ranks.
[00:46:09.269 --> 00:46:14.710]  And you just run around and do whatever you want, and killing Martin Luther King and Kennedy and everything else, and we're sick of it.
[00:46:18.729 --> 00:46:22.670]  At the same time, it's going to help the New World Order.
[00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:34.932]  And Bush funded, for this year, in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, and into next year, martial law, quote, for riots and insurrection by the American people.
[00:46:34.952 --> 00:46:36.072]  They never put that in writing.
[00:46:37.812 --> 00:46:40.473]  And this whole thing has provocateur-ed written all over it.
[00:46:41.233 --> 00:46:42.873]  Especially when that helicopter came through.
[00:46:42.893 --> 00:46:46.174]  So we're getting mixed signals here.
[00:46:51.539 --> 00:46:57.360]  And I remember telling people, I know right here in Austin, I remember saying, man, you're crazy to go up there.
[00:46:58.121 --> 00:47:01.582]  I said, guaranteed, half of the people Brown thinks are his buddies are feds.
[00:47:01.982 --> 00:47:03.222]  He's completely surrounded.
[00:47:03.582 --> 00:47:06.663]  They're just laughing all the way to the bank with this one.
[00:47:07.683 --> 00:47:09.343]  They're in control of the situation.
[00:47:09.363 --> 00:47:10.324]  This is a psy-op.
[00:47:10.504 --> 00:47:11.784]  I smell a giant rat.
[00:47:12.464 --> 00:47:19.206]  And Brown is going to end up getting killed, or more likely, they're going to be all around him one night and pull their guns out and pistol whip him within an inch of his life.
[00:47:20.726 --> 00:47:22.548]  Oh, no, he's too heavily defended.
[00:47:22.588 --> 00:47:25.069]  He's too... I mean, come on, folks.
[00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:31.334]  You don't let crowds of people in, knowing a bunch of them could be feds, if you're seriously not trying to be apprehended.
[00:47:34.657 --> 00:47:38.319]  Then we get into all the debate about, well, Brown didn't do anything wrong.
[00:47:38.399 --> 00:47:39.100]  No, he didn't!
[00:47:40.321 --> 00:47:42.563]  The income tax is an offshore fraud.
[00:47:43.023 --> 00:47:44.284]  The New World Order is private.
[00:47:44.304 --> 00:47:45.765]  The District of Columbia is private.
[00:47:50.473 --> 00:47:53.754]  And we're winning the fight peacefully to wake up the people.
[00:47:55.014 --> 00:47:59.516]  Treasury agent, Joe Bannister, 1997, driving along in the Bay Area.
[00:48:01.416 --> 00:48:02.037]  Here's D.B.
[00:48:02.077 --> 00:48:08.699]  Kidd on a syndicated radio show, talking about how the Federal Reserve's private, the IRS is their collection agency.
[00:48:08.939 --> 00:48:14.480]  He spends two years quietly researching it because he was going to go disprove her and then go out and expose her.
[00:48:15.001 --> 00:48:19.502]  He thought it was all true, went to his supervisors and they said, shut up about this, don't talk about it.
[00:48:21.556 --> 00:48:23.397]  They all know, folks, at the higher levels.
[00:48:24.837 --> 00:48:27.098]  We didn't have an income tax until 1913.
[00:48:27.338 --> 00:48:30.638]  It wasn't enforced on the general public until the early 1950s.
[00:48:31.579 --> 00:48:32.919]  And then it was a few percentage points.
[00:48:33.639 --> 00:48:34.840]  We built this country without it.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:38.441]  It is to the private banks, as Ronald Reagan's Commission in 81 found.
[00:48:38.461 --> 00:48:38.581]  So,
[00:48:45.177 --> 00:48:49.060]  We're winning the fight, so what did they do a few years after he went public?
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.643]  They indicted him, had to trump up charges on him, he was found not guilty.
[00:48:55.045 --> 00:49:02.090]  What happened to the lawyer down in Louisiana, Tommy K. Cryer, represented by Larry Becraft, found not guilty?
[00:49:03.217 --> 00:49:04.958]  What happened last week or two weeks ago?
[00:49:05.419 --> 00:49:07.540]  Four-month trial ends with no convictions.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:11.003]  Federal income tax evasion case involved nine defendants.
[00:49:11.383 --> 00:49:20.229]  A criminal tax case alleging income tax evasion and conspiracy dissolved in federal court this week when a jury returned zero convictions on 161 charges faced by nine defendants.
[00:49:25.285 --> 00:49:29.506]  If you even get a semi-fair trial now, the public has learned about this now.
[00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:34.828]  It's not something that a few good ol' boys know about, or a few tax attorneys know about, or a few bankers know about.
[00:49:35.248 --> 00:49:39.749]  Now, around half the public knows it's a fraud.
[00:49:41.169 --> 00:49:48.712]  Thanks to all the work you've done, listeners, in America, Freedom to Fascism, and DV Kid, and Red Beckman 30, 40 years ago.
[00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:53.813]  I mean, he had IRS come to his house, beat him up, bulldoze his little trailer, World War II vet.
[00:49:57.697 --> 00:49:59.038]  People have gone through hell for this.
[00:49:59.098 --> 00:50:00.818]  Congressman Hanson held hearings on it.
[00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:05.720]  They came and grabbed him, beat him with an inch of his life, and tortured him for months.
[00:50:07.601 --> 00:50:09.342]  Knocked his teeth out, a congressman.
[00:50:09.542 --> 00:50:12.303]  I mean, they used to be hardcore killers on this.
[00:50:12.363 --> 00:50:13.143]  Now they're scared.
[00:50:13.183 --> 00:50:14.764]  Now, see, now they're acting different.
[00:50:14.924 --> 00:50:16.044]  Okay, we want to go slow.
[00:50:16.064 --> 00:50:16.985]  We don't want to wake up.
[00:50:17.165 --> 00:50:18.405]  We know you're mad at us.
[00:50:19.406 --> 00:50:21.747]  You've never seen federal marshals talk like that.
[00:50:23.127 --> 00:50:24.708]  They're beginning to learn.
[00:50:24.748 --> 00:50:26.108]  They're beginning to look.
[00:50:26.749 --> 00:50:26.889]  See?
[00:50:28.507 --> 00:50:30.428]  A lot of them are Joe Bannisters, folks!
[00:50:30.528 --> 00:50:31.749]  They don't know!
[00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:34.911]  We don't want to run out and shoot them!
[00:50:35.572 --> 00:50:36.772]  We want to wake them up!
[00:50:36.892 --> 00:50:37.873]  Those that we can!
[00:50:38.373 --> 00:50:40.194]  We're winning right now!
[00:50:41.175 --> 00:50:42.276]  In the Infowar!
[00:50:43.737 --> 00:50:47.099]  It will help the globalists to kill cops and feds!
[00:50:48.219 --> 00:50:51.602]  That is the last thing we want!
[00:50:52.362 --> 00:50:56.785]  We want to recruit these people, not kill them and set off martial law!
[00:51:04.281 --> 00:51:09.743]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.124 --> 00:51:17.767]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.453 --> 00:51:25.496]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.896 --> 00:51:37.301]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.641 --> 00:51:41.183]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.583 --> 00:51:43.824]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.864 --> 00:51:47.706]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.328 --> 00:52:04.892]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:04.932 --> 00:52:05.453]  are located?
[00:52:05.653 --> 00:52:09.036]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:55:06.707 --> 00:55:11.529]  Mike and Eileen and many others said they've got information on the Browns.
[00:55:11.709 --> 00:55:12.949]  And here's the problem with this.
[00:55:12.969 --> 00:55:13.609]  I'm going to go to you.
[00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:16.030]  But I don't know who's who.
[00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:18.131]  I know about the gentlemen.
[00:55:21.787 --> 00:55:22.588]  Sean Kravish.
[00:55:23.728 --> 00:55:25.229]  I know that he runs a website for him.
[00:55:25.289 --> 00:55:26.090]  I've heard him on the air.
[00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:27.051]  I've talked to him before.
[00:55:27.071 --> 00:55:28.592]  I know that's legit.
[00:55:28.952 --> 00:55:37.277]  I really don't want to put out speculation and things here on air, so just announce whether it's speculation or whether it's something you've been able to confirm when we get you on.
[00:55:37.318 --> 00:55:41.160]  I appreciate people calling in on those subjects, and we're going to go to you.
[00:55:43.201 --> 00:55:45.323]  But just finishing up what I was trying to say earlier.
[00:55:46.866 --> 00:55:56.834]  They try to use TV shows like Jack Bauer and The Training that they actually give them, that we're a bunch of animals, that they're allowed to torture us, that the government's good, but the board's that.
[00:55:56.854 --> 00:55:58.515]  Everybody knows the government's criminal now.
[00:55:59.676 --> 00:56:06.261]  Anybody who's got half a brain knows that, and it's just our job to keep exposing the IRS and the Federal Reserve, and they're crumbling.
[00:56:06.361 --> 00:56:07.842]  Everybody knows they're the enemy now.
[00:56:07.882 --> 00:56:09.023]  The people know it's private.
[00:56:09.043 --> 00:56:09.883]  They know it's a fraud.
[00:56:09.923 --> 00:56:11.885]  They know it's a private corporation.
[00:56:13.544 --> 00:56:18.866]  More and more in federal and state court, people are winning tax cases, not just federal, but state as well.
[00:56:19.946 --> 00:56:22.386]  And we're winning the information war peacefully.
[00:56:24.247 --> 00:56:27.088]  And I know they've built FEMA camps, and I know they want to shoot in war.
[00:56:27.768 --> 00:56:32.029]  The New World Order doesn't care if a bunch of cops and feds and their minions get killed in a fight with the American people.
[00:56:32.249 --> 00:56:34.150]  They want to play us off against each other.
[00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:36.150]  Again, it's divide and conquer.
[00:56:37.251 --> 00:56:42.212]  Where they want to get us into little factionalized groups that only talk about which group supposedly runs the New World Order.
[00:56:43.317 --> 00:56:45.257]  When it's a consortium of crime syndicates.
[00:56:45.778 --> 00:56:46.578]  Some more than others.
[00:56:46.718 --> 00:56:48.278]  Regardless, let's fight the New World Order.
[00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:49.998]  Let's expose its system.
[00:56:51.319 --> 00:57:01.421]  Instead of being manipulated by the COINTELPRO and just spending all our time ninnying about who's the best host or who writes the best articles, let's go wake other people up about the basics.
[00:57:01.441 --> 00:57:05.001]  I mean, that's what I do.
[00:57:05.341 --> 00:57:12.923]  I've woken up countless people that are kind of like my bad children that then weevil about mad that, well, you woke me up, but you're bad.
[00:57:13.635 --> 00:57:18.957]  Because now I just obsess on how it's this group or that group and never wake anybody up.
[00:57:19.017 --> 00:57:22.158]  Well, just please remember the basic work of waking people up.
[00:57:23.338 --> 00:57:25.959]  I try to give the other talk show hosting people tips, too.
[00:57:26.379 --> 00:57:29.200]  Cover the news, cover the information, cover how this stuff works.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:36.382]  Don't go right to, you know, sewing circle inside politics of different niches.
[00:57:38.923 --> 00:57:40.263]  But we need to pray for Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:57:40.283 --> 00:57:43.364]  We're going to get a big article out with these updates and these alerts that have been put out.
[00:57:44.128 --> 00:57:47.710]  On PrisonPlanet.com, the next few hours, Paul Watson's working on it right now.
[00:57:48.251 --> 00:57:49.692]  I think it's key to call the media.
[00:57:51.293 --> 00:57:57.797]  Because the marshals are federally compartmentalized, and they've admitted before, they just basically don't answer the phones.
[00:57:58.377 --> 00:57:59.398]  I'm not saying don't call.
[00:57:59.418 --> 00:58:06.982]  My point is, the media needs to be demanded that WRMU, what's the one up there in Plainfield I can look it up?
[00:58:08.303 --> 00:58:09.704]  WMUR, something like that.
[00:58:11.952 --> 00:58:18.417]  We need to call them, you need to call the local papers, and then they'll cover it, and then it'll be picked up nationally.
[00:58:19.077 --> 00:58:28.043]  I'd call AP in New Hampshire, AP in surrounding states, the AP Bureau offices, and say, hey, you know, this guy's been disappeared.
[00:58:28.624 --> 00:58:31.026]  They won't see where he is for almost four days.
[00:58:31.086 --> 00:58:33.407]  That's a violation of federal law.
[00:58:34.648 --> 00:58:37.790]  And that's how you get the ball rolling, folks.
[00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:38.651]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.313 --> 00:58:45.609]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNLive.com or call 877-300-7000.
[00:58:57.364 --> 00:58:58.025]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.685 --> 00:58:59.806]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.446 --> 00:59:01.547]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.208 --> 00:59:03.048]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.769 --> 00:59:04.710]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:09.273]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.533 --> 00:59:13.696]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.877 --> 00:59:22.123]  Alright, for stations that are just joining us, Ron Paul says dollar could collapse to absolute zero.
[00:59:23.224 --> 00:59:24.585]  Other nations concur.
[00:59:27.114 --> 00:59:30.037]  The FBI puts anti-war protesters on criminal database.
[00:59:30.117 --> 00:59:36.582]  Canada uses the ban to bar protesters from entering the country, including former U.S.
[00:59:36.622 --> 00:59:37.243]  ambassadors.
[00:59:37.944 --> 00:59:40.266]  Ambassadors, Ken's wife.
[00:59:41.367 --> 00:59:44.429]  We have got so much other news, and I'm going to cover it today.
[00:59:44.509 --> 00:59:48.052]  Jim Brossard is also going to be coming on.
[00:59:48.072 --> 00:59:51.655]  He's the guy that cut down the Mexican flag in Reno last week.
[00:59:52.216 --> 00:59:54.238]  Well, we've got him popping in, coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:59:55.985 --> 01:00:01.271]  Ed and Elaine Brown grabbed about 745 Eastern last Thursday night.
[01:00:02.573 --> 01:00:14.467]  Elaine a few days ago, it was by Saturday, was registered, we've now confirmed this, at the Danbury Women's Prison Facility.
[01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:23.858]  And now, Ed Brown is missing in action, and this violates a whole bunch of federal regulations and laws.
[01:00:24.139 --> 01:00:28.964]  They've got to have a chain of custody where those people are, and they're no doubt torturing him and desaling him.
[01:00:29.004 --> 01:00:30.426]  You can just bet your bottom dollar.
[01:00:31.269 --> 01:00:35.154]  Because they do that generally anyways, but on top of it, it's all part of the freedom.
[01:00:35.174 --> 01:00:37.897]  Oh yeah, they've been torturing Americans forever, folks.
[01:00:37.917 --> 01:00:41.020]  They're just using it on the Iraqis to train you that it's acceptable now.
[01:00:41.321 --> 01:00:42.602]  Oh, see, it's good to use it on them.
[01:00:42.622 --> 01:00:43.503]  Oh, it's good on you.
[01:00:43.523 --> 01:00:48.148]  Kind of like the head of the Air Force said earlier this year in the Associated Press, he said,
[01:00:50.163 --> 01:00:57.986]  You know, we can't use these microwave guns because of the Geneva Convention overseas, but if we use them on American citizens first, then we can claim that they're okay and use them there.
[01:00:58.246 --> 01:01:02.347]  So they're just waiting in major cities to microwave gun the public, burn your skin.
[01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:05.968]  It's just totally sick.
[01:01:06.008 --> 01:01:07.869]  It's just horrible.
[01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:13.811]  And so, we're going to get big updates up on PrisonPlanet.com very, very soon on this subject.
[01:01:17.429 --> 01:01:19.170]  It's absolutely horrible what's happening.
[01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:21.731]  We all need to pray for Ed and Elaine Brown right now.
[01:01:21.751 --> 01:01:29.175]  At the same time, I had my own advice that I tried to give people when the Feds were about to go in there and raid them.
[01:01:29.915 --> 01:01:31.416]  I said, Feds don't do that.
[01:01:31.456 --> 01:01:32.357]  Don't murder these people.
[01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:33.537]  You have no right to do that.
[01:01:34.618 --> 01:01:38.160]  It's also going to make them martyrs and escalate more further crises.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.361]  Cooler heads did prevail.
[01:01:42.102 --> 01:01:44.663]  And then it didn't help much on our side to say,
[01:01:45.721 --> 01:01:53.405]  Uh, you know, for the Patriots to say, and Ed to say on air that he shoots into the woods when stuff would move, that is not a proper use of a firearm.
[01:01:54.305 --> 01:01:56.306]  You better know exactly who and what you're shooting at.
[01:01:57.166 --> 01:01:59.247]  And that escalated it just into a whole other level.
[01:01:59.347 --> 01:01:59.707]  It did.
[01:02:00.688 --> 01:02:04.930]  And, um, made it a lot harder to try to de-escalate this.
[01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:09.091]  And, um, he threatened to kill those feds.
[01:02:09.312 --> 01:02:12.533]  Folks, they're probably torturing him so bad right now, it's just off the charts.
[01:02:13.293 --> 01:02:13.954]  That's what they do.
[01:02:13.994 --> 01:02:14.814]  They live by terror.
[01:02:15.825 --> 01:02:17.026]  Poor fools don't know them.
[01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:19.227]  The government gives their kids deadly vaccines, too.
[01:02:19.387 --> 01:02:20.548]  They drink the poison water.
[01:02:20.608 --> 01:02:21.649]  They live in the corrupt system.
[01:02:21.689 --> 01:02:23.070]  Their dollar's been devalued.
[01:02:24.011 --> 01:02:33.297]  The very globalists that run this government are getting rid of our borders right now, getting rid of our sovereignty, but you think, well, I'll just be part of the power system and part of my own little gang, and everything will be okay.
[01:02:33.317 --> 01:02:34.538]  I mean, it's not going to be okay.
[01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:36.259]  It's not going to be okay.
[01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:40.531]  And in my gut I know they're torturing Ed right now.
[01:02:40.571 --> 01:02:43.512]  There's absolutely no doubt that's happening.
[01:02:43.532 --> 01:02:46.633]  They're probably working him over so bad it just makes your head spin.
[01:02:49.434 --> 01:03:03.859]  And you know, getting beaten from the studies and examples and the stories that have been told, the accounts of soldiers going back hundreds of years that I've read, North Africa, the French Foreign Legion, all of it,
[01:03:04.782 --> 01:03:21.071]  Being restrained in a truck and being driven around with the diesel fumes for day after day after day, soiling yourself, only being given water, being strapped down, your feet busting open, being beaten in between, is about as bad a torture as it gets.
[01:03:23.092 --> 01:03:25.853]  They're probably got plastic bags over his head.
[01:03:25.914 --> 01:03:27.174]  They're probably working on him.
[01:03:30.396 --> 01:03:31.697]  They don't care anymore, folks.
[01:03:31.777 --> 01:03:34.038]  They just... It's all about killing America.
[01:03:35.959 --> 01:03:37.681]  It's all about bringing the country down.
[01:03:38.262 --> 01:03:44.270]  They're literally, the feds are literally in their own lifeboat drilling holes in the bottom of it, giggling as water sprays up.
[01:03:45.913 --> 01:03:50.960]  But, you know, they'll just have to see the country destroyed by their own hands before they understand that.
[01:03:53.419 --> 01:03:54.160]  Terrorism!
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:55.100]  Terrorism!
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:01.265]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:04:01.525 --> 01:04:03.106]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:04:03.366 --> 01:04:05.848]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:04:06.228 --> 01:04:20.798]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:04:20.838 --> 01:04:21.159]  government.
[01:04:21.319 --> 01:04:23.080]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:29.402]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:04:29.542 --> 01:04:34.023]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:39.645]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:04:39.785 --> 01:04:41.925]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you at 888-803-4438.
[01:04:41.945 --> 01:04:43.706]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:59.122]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:59.483 --> 01:05:01.404]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:09.429]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.109 --> 01:05:17.154]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.554 --> 01:05:20.536]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:05:20.837 --> 01:05:23.218]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[01:05:23.638 --> 01:05:24.519]  NSA spying.
[01:05:24.941 --> 01:05:28.943]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.284 --> 01:05:32.966]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.266 --> 01:05:35.487]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.507 --> 01:05:39.450]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:53.029]  Attention!
[01:05:53.169 --> 01:05:55.130]  This is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:59.592]  Honeybees are now mysteriously vanishing at an astonishing pace across the entire country.
[01:05:59.752 --> 01:06:02.674]  Why is this urgent message about honeybees so desperately important?
[01:06:02.894 --> 01:06:03.854]  The answer is easy.
[01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:10.237]  You see, honeybees produce a unique compound, fed only to the queen, that makes her live six times longer than other bees in the hive.
[01:06:10.437 --> 01:06:14.479]  Some researchers now believe the compound may have miraculous effects on humans as well.
[01:06:14.659 --> 01:06:16.200]  The compound is called royal jelly.
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:16.780]  I don't know.
[01:06:35.669 --> 01:06:36.109]  I think so.
[01:06:57.330 --> 01:07:01.516]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:07:02.177 --> 01:07:03.038]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.739 --> 01:07:04.801]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.302 --> 01:07:09.247]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.508 --> 01:07:13.574]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.066 --> 01:07:27.295]  There is no doubt, the more I think about it, Ed's been captured for almost four days, up in New Hampshire, outside Plainfield, for not paying into the private federal reserve, which isn't even a law.
[01:07:28.776 --> 01:07:32.159]  The feds are losing cases all over the country, by the way, the word's out, crooks.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.020]  There is no doubt.
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.602]  They're probably not desaling him.
[01:07:35.662 --> 01:07:39.925]  They've probably got him at a secretive federal facility.
[01:07:40.774 --> 01:07:44.596]  There is no doubt that they've got FBI interrogators in there.
[01:07:44.616 --> 01:07:50.338]  The FBI has been running all this the whole time, wanting people to keep their mouth shut about that, threatening people, Danny Reilly and others.
[01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:52.319]  They go to prison and they talk about it.
[01:07:53.539 --> 01:08:01.483]  And they are probably going overtime on him, torturing him 24 hours a day.
[01:08:02.343 --> 01:08:05.104]  There is no doubt in my mind that he's being tortured.
[01:08:05.824 --> 01:08:09.746]  And it could be as mild as keeping him in a chair, chained to a chair,
[01:08:10.652 --> 01:08:11.013]  I think?
[01:08:30.385 --> 01:08:39.609]  But knowing the way these guys are, it's probably bags over the head, beatings, electricity, things that don't leave too many marks.
[01:08:39.809 --> 01:08:40.649]  But sometimes they don't care.
[01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:41.410]  They may have gone to town.
[01:08:41.690 --> 01:08:44.391]  For all we know, there is a chance they could have beaten Ed to death.
[01:08:45.928 --> 01:08:48.609]  But they wouldn't be out saying that to the media right now.
[01:08:48.629 --> 01:08:50.490]  It's a small chance.
[01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:53.891]  Or that he's, a little bit bigger chance that he's in really bad condition.
[01:08:53.911 --> 01:08:58.612]  You know, he could be out, knocked out in a coma, in a bed for all we know.
[01:08:58.953 --> 01:09:09.896]  That's why the federal government under habeas corpus has to say where people are and what they're charged with, and they have to show a chain of custody and be transparent.
[01:09:10.196 --> 01:09:11.777]  You can't disappear into a black hole.
[01:09:12.412 --> 01:09:34.026]  But under the Enemy Combatant Designation and the Military Commissions Act of 2006, the Feds say that if the President, Secretary of Defense, or any of his designates in Homeland Security say that you are a terrorist, then you lose your citizenship instantly under their imperial edict and can disappear into a black phantasm.
[01:09:35.545 --> 01:09:38.288]  Uh, and, uh, that may have happened here.
[01:09:38.848 --> 01:09:59.205]  The fact that he does not show up, and I've gone and checked on the computer myself, in the Bureau of Prisons Registry, and the fact that phone calls are, and it is a holiday today, but there are feds still staffed at all these places, we need to call the Concord paper, we need to call the Plainfield paper, we need to call the local TV stations, the, the AP bureaus,
[01:10:00.326 --> 01:10:01.266]  And I can't do that.
[01:10:01.306 --> 01:10:02.046]  I'm on air right now.
[01:10:02.266 --> 01:10:06.167]  You need to do that, listeners, and call me back and tell them, hey, this guy's disappeared.
[01:10:06.487 --> 01:10:07.427]  They won't say where he is.
[01:10:07.467 --> 01:10:08.207]  That's a big issue.
[01:10:08.568 --> 01:10:11.428]  And talk to these reporters like they're dumb, because most of them aren't really stupid.
[01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:15.449]  Go, hey, habeas corpus, due process, federal regulations and laws.
[01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:16.729]  We're supposed to say where he is.
[01:10:16.809 --> 01:10:25.431]  Why is Elaine at Danbury, Connecticut, prisoner number 03924-049, and why don't we have Ed Brown enrolled?
[01:10:31.286 --> 01:10:32.466]  Why hasn't that happened?
[01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:36.248]  Okay, this is very serious.
[01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:41.610]  And see, these were people's lives we were talking about here.
[01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:52.294]  I mean, Ed may have wanted to go out in a blaze of glory, and his wife may have been consigned to that, and their back was against the wall.
[01:10:52.454 --> 01:10:55.555]  I understand why they did what they did, and you can only admire the courage.
[01:10:56.876 --> 01:10:59.256]  But do we want to start a civil war?
[01:10:59.316 --> 01:11:00.557]  Do we want to get violent?
[01:11:01.537 --> 01:11:03.078]  I mean, is that the time for this?
[01:11:03.478 --> 01:11:05.819]  Or are we winning all these federal cases on the income tax?
[01:11:06.079 --> 01:11:07.720]  Are people waking up to the Federal Reserve?
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:12.043]  Are 80-plus percent of Americans aware that 9-11 was an inside job at major polls?
[01:11:13.383 --> 01:11:15.344]  Is the war 80-plus percent unpopular?
[01:11:18.446 --> 01:11:24.969]  It just came out that Bush signed a secret executive order ordering torture, but then when his people got caught, he sent them to prison?
[01:11:28.191 --> 01:11:30.272]  I mean, that is so criminal, it's just off the chart.
[01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:34.649]  All right, let's see what new developments all these callers have.
[01:11:34.849 --> 01:11:37.751]  And again, this is all rumor until we can prove it.
[01:11:38.912 --> 01:11:42.875]  But we appreciate them claiming that they're calling in with some intel, and I'm sure it is good information.
[01:11:43.275 --> 01:11:44.235]  We just can't guarantee it.
[01:11:44.255 --> 01:11:46.837]  Eileen in Mass, you're on the air.
[01:12:01.812 --> 01:12:02.953]  Registered, but Ed isn't.
[01:12:03.073 --> 01:12:17.466]  Now on Ed, it has a release date of the same as the one for Elaine, 4-30-2012.
[01:12:18.406 --> 01:12:20.508]  But it shows he's not in BOP custody.
[01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:29.356]  And I am going to go through and do a Freedom of Information check on this.
[01:12:29.947 --> 01:12:32.248]  Okay, that's fine and dandy, but that could be six weeks.
[01:12:32.308 --> 01:12:33.469]  We don't have time for that.
[01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:34.310]  No, I understand.
[01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:40.353]  The media needs to... But I understand in six weeks, you might actually get the chain of custody, though, I doubt it.
[01:12:41.354 --> 01:12:41.674]  I know.
[01:12:43.095 --> 01:12:46.517]  This is government we're talking about, so I'm not expecting a whole heck of a lot.
[01:12:46.557 --> 01:12:49.158]  Okay, so you went to the computer like we did, and like... Exactly.
[01:12:49.799 --> 01:12:51.900]  Sean Kradish did, and got the same thing.
[01:12:53.261 --> 01:12:55.162]  They're just saying he's in a black hole, basically.
[01:12:55.862 --> 01:12:56.662]  Yeah, basically.
[01:12:56.942 --> 01:13:00.304]  They're saying, well, you know, he's not in our custody, so we don't know where he is.
[01:13:01.004 --> 01:13:03.365]  Well, the headline is, Ed Brown on the loose!
[01:13:04.485 --> 01:13:10.527]  See, I mean, if they won't tell us where he is, then I guess Ed Brown's either dead, or on the loose, or maybe space aliens abducted him.
[01:13:10.867 --> 01:13:11.708]  Eileen, anything else?
[01:13:12.448 --> 01:13:13.568]  No, that was it, Alex.
[01:13:13.588 --> 01:13:14.208]  Okay, Mike.
[01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:15.309]  That could be more helpful.
[01:13:15.529 --> 01:13:16.189]  No, no, thank you.
[01:13:16.209 --> 01:13:16.709]  Keep checking.
[01:13:16.729 --> 01:13:17.770]  That's just more verification.
[01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:20.991]  Uh, Michael in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:13:21.011 --> 01:13:23.352]  Hello?
[01:13:23.592 --> 01:13:24.072]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:35.059]  Well, yeah, I looked up some information on this and I found a place that said, this guy says, I found that Ed is in transit to the Elkhorn facility in Ohio.
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:41.165]  It says that that's the reason the locator comes up with not in BOP custody.
[01:13:42.326 --> 01:13:43.647]  In transit?
[01:13:43.807 --> 01:13:47.050]  We've heard he could be in transit to, quote, Ohio.
[01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:47.430]  Right.
[01:13:48.396 --> 01:13:55.722]  Well, what worries me is that I went to, uh, I went to refresh the page and find the website again because I wanted to give you the address.
[01:13:56.323 --> 01:13:56.703]  It's gone!
[01:13:59.005 --> 01:14:00.866]  And where specifically in Ohio?
[01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:02.207]  Elkhorn.
[01:14:02.728 --> 01:14:03.428]  Elkhorn.
[01:14:03.729 --> 01:14:04.349]  E-L-K-C-O-N.
[01:14:06.291 --> 01:14:07.452]  Well, that's our new industry.
[01:14:07.512 --> 01:14:10.134]  Not building cars or making computers or having jobs.
[01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:13.176]  Just prisons everywhere and pot-bellied goons ruling over us.
[01:14:16.019 --> 01:14:16.359]  Amazing.
[01:14:17.791 --> 01:14:19.512]  What do you think of this whole situation, Michael?
[01:14:20.073 --> 01:14:25.977]  Well, I think that all of us should be so lucky to have somebody this concerned.
[01:14:26.777 --> 01:14:31.781]  You know, I hope that as many are concerned about me when they come and get me.
[01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.582]  Exactly, that's what I've been thinking about.
[01:14:34.602 --> 01:14:38.285]  I mean, folks, I mean, the black hole, this is horrible.
[01:14:38.525 --> 01:14:43.128]  You know, you see yellow police line do not cross crime scene in front of my shop.
[01:14:43.849 --> 01:14:44.089]  You know,
[01:14:45.282 --> 01:14:46.023]  Something happened.
[01:14:47.624 --> 01:14:50.926]  And it certainly wasn't a criminal on my side.
[01:14:51.227 --> 01:14:51.607]  I hear you.
[01:14:51.647 --> 01:14:52.447]  I appreciate your call.
[01:14:52.467 --> 01:14:54.509]  Look, that's how tyranny rules, is by fear.
[01:14:55.790 --> 01:15:03.516]  And Alexander Shultz and Nietzsche talked about physically fighting back when they had grabbed, like, half the population of a Russian city and were grabbing people every night.
[01:15:03.996 --> 01:15:10.961]  And if it ever comes to that, just arresting everyone, putting everybody in camps, see, we're such tyranny now, it's radical to say we have a right and a duty to fight back.
[01:15:11.442 --> 01:15:14.624]  But at this point, waking people up, the system being discredited,
[01:15:15.248 --> 01:15:19.532]  I mean, if they try to go to martial law now without violent provocations, they're not going to get away with it.
[01:15:19.592 --> 01:15:21.053]  They need violent provocations.
[01:15:21.153 --> 01:15:21.954]  We don't want that.
[01:15:23.115 --> 01:15:24.936]  And the rank-and-file Fed doesn't want that.
[01:15:26.017 --> 01:15:27.338]  And some of them are like Joe Bannister.
[01:15:27.358 --> 01:15:32.102]  They're not all, you know, little conceited, wannabe tough guy, Cobra Commander types.
[01:15:33.223 --> 01:15:35.505]  Let's go ahead and talk to Thomas in Georgia.
[01:15:35.525 --> 01:15:36.486]  You're on the air, Thomas.
[01:15:37.207 --> 01:15:37.667]  Hi, Alex.
[01:15:37.807 --> 01:15:38.668]  How are you doing?
[01:15:39.924 --> 01:15:46.148]  Yeah, I wanted to admit, I did said time, I got indicted and arrested in 1997 in November.
[01:15:46.168 --> 01:15:49.710]  So I have a little bit of understanding on how they work.
[01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:51.871]  The federal, you know, the U.S.
[01:15:51.931 --> 01:15:52.811]  Marshals, etc.
[01:15:52.911 --> 01:15:53.572]  Okay, tell us.
[01:15:54.012 --> 01:15:59.455]  You know, the number he gave, Elaine's number is probably her United States Marshal number.
[01:15:59.515 --> 01:16:00.656]  That kind of sticks with you.
[01:16:00.696 --> 01:16:04.177]  The last three digits probably have to do with the area she got convicted in.
[01:16:04.197 --> 01:16:05.178]  The district?
[01:16:05.678 --> 01:16:06.519]  The district, yes.
[01:16:08.249 --> 01:16:10.451]  I got convicted in South Carolina.
[01:16:10.991 --> 01:16:13.614]  They used a task force that was for drugs.
[01:16:14.875 --> 01:16:22.901]  A lot of times they use local task force, which is city, local, county, DEA involved.
[01:16:24.022 --> 01:16:25.443]  They take their time indicting you.
[01:16:25.463 --> 01:16:37.633]  They leave you in county jails for a long time before they'll ever, you know, it can take, depending on how many co-defendants you have, it can take a year for them to do their investigation while you sit without bond.
[01:16:38.539 --> 01:16:54.705]  And de-slinging him, they could be moving him from county jail to county jail because the feds have contracts with various cities and counties to put their detainees or their prisoners, depending on if they've been convicted yet or not, which is the difference between a detainee and a prisoner.
[01:16:55.706 --> 01:16:59.267]  And they'll move them from county to county, from city to city.
[01:16:59.847 --> 01:17:06.430]  Sometimes you mess with them psychologically as soon as you get adjusted because it is kind of a big deal when you're in that position.
[01:17:07.219 --> 01:17:28.879]  You know, if you do get settled in a county jail for a little while, you know, for them to up and move you, well, if they do this every 24 hours, 36 hours, you know, that can be a form, you know, of torture or whatever or, you know, trying to make them comply or them trying to get even with Ed or, you know, however they're looking upon the situation.
[01:17:28.939 --> 01:17:30.720]  Well, you obviously weren't dieseled.
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:33.443]  Diesel is where they don't even get you off.
[01:17:34.204 --> 01:17:35.144]  They just keep driving.
[01:17:35.945 --> 01:17:38.766]  No, I've heard about it and I've talked to inmates about it.
[01:17:38.826 --> 01:17:41.927]  I did time in Edgefield, South Carolina at a federal camp.
[01:17:42.367 --> 01:17:46.949]  Because you were using or selling the products the feds control and ship in.
[01:17:47.449 --> 01:17:48.890]  Yeah, well I've since learned that.
[01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:50.231]  This happened ten years ago.
[01:17:50.451 --> 01:17:53.252]  No, but I mean it's just another sick joke.
[01:17:53.632 --> 01:17:54.552]  No, I agree.
[01:17:54.612 --> 01:17:58.334]  I've listened to you for about five years and I'm quite aware of what's going on.
[01:17:58.354 --> 01:18:01.015]  I went to Falwell's Neocon Liberty University and
[01:18:01.653 --> 01:18:04.815]  Actually said something when I graduated in May of 05.
[01:18:05.335 --> 01:18:14.540]  He was the last hand you shook during the commencement and I said we needed to discuss the new world order because I took a picture of you and I had about two seconds and he gave me a horrible look and I just kept going.
[01:18:15.221 --> 01:18:22.485]  But I'm well aware of what's going on around the world and here with the police state 9-11 and it's very discouraging in the economy.
[01:18:25.234 --> 01:18:26.015]  Yep.
[01:18:26.095 --> 01:18:28.777]  You know, I know now about the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:18:28.877 --> 01:18:33.662]  I didn't know when they arrested you, but I mean, the Fourth Amendment, there was none with my case.
[01:18:33.822 --> 01:18:35.203]  Did they get you to plea bargain?
[01:18:35.524 --> 01:18:35.964]  Of course.
[01:18:36.565 --> 01:18:37.786]  You know, I had a lawyer.
[01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:39.007]  My parents got me a lawyer.
[01:18:39.027 --> 01:18:40.388]  Yeah, of course I plea bargained.
[01:18:40.588 --> 01:18:42.991]  Now I realize I'm 35 now, not 25.
[01:18:43.211 --> 01:18:45.133]  You know, I realize.
[01:18:46.033 --> 01:18:48.035]  Hey, listen, I really appreciate you, my friend.
[01:18:48.055 --> 01:18:48.896]  We'll be right back.

[01:20:55.488 --> 01:20:58.548]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:20:58.808 --> 01:21:03.370]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:06.350]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:21:06.890 --> 01:21:13.572]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.

[01:21:56.397 --> 01:22:03.525]  Did you know that Bible prophecy talks about the United States, British Commonwealth, Russia, China, and the communist world in the last days?
[01:22:04.366 --> 01:22:10.012]  Did you know that it predicts a confrontation between atheistic communism and the western world of Christianity?
[01:22:10.713 --> 01:22:14.137]  The plans have already been laid and they conform to Bible prophecy.
[01:22:14.877 --> 01:22:15.278]  I think so.

[01:23:12.284 --> 01:23:14.845]  It's going to be popping in for about 10 minutes in the next segment.
[01:23:15.125 --> 01:23:16.585]  Then I'm going to get into all the other news.
[01:23:17.226 --> 01:23:19.026]  On the dollar, big developments there.
[01:23:19.406 --> 01:23:22.107]  The police state, cell phones and children.
[01:23:22.727 --> 01:23:26.108]  Very important information coming up and I will cover it all.
[01:23:26.789 --> 01:23:31.070]  Right now, Mary in West Virginia, you're on the air talking about the Ed and Elaine Brown case.
[01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:32.750]  Ed in a black hole somewhere.
[01:23:35.791 --> 01:23:36.852]  Your phone's really bad.
[01:23:37.252 --> 01:23:37.732]  How's that?
[01:23:38.243 --> 01:23:39.204]  Just talk right into it.
[01:23:39.484 --> 01:23:40.685]  Alright, can you hear me okay?
[01:23:40.885 --> 01:23:41.566]  Yeah, just go ahead.
[01:23:41.666 --> 01:23:43.347]  Alright, I want to challenge you, Alex.
[01:23:45.009 --> 01:23:47.771]  I simply want you to name me a country in Europe.
[01:23:48.292 --> 01:24:04.906]  If there's a person in the United States, and because he's gotten the local, or let's say the state government mad at him, and they're part of the New World Order, and they can control things, where he travels and stuff in the United States, he can't get a good job, he can't do this, he can't do that.
[01:24:05.506 --> 01:24:06.427]  It's bad enough.
[01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:10.115]  He's been attacked, okay, in various places in the United States.
[01:24:11.016 --> 01:24:12.919]  And nothing ever comes of it when he goes to the cops.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:21.913]  If he wants to go to Europe, because he can't live in the United States and be happy and have a life, what one country do you think he would have the least trouble in?
[01:24:24.062 --> 01:24:27.365]  You know, I really... I mean, I've looked at other countries.
[01:24:27.385 --> 01:24:29.707]  They're all under similar police state systems.
[01:24:30.148 --> 01:24:35.052]  But a lot of times, though, you go somewhere new and lie low, you won't get back in their sights there.
[01:24:35.092 --> 01:24:36.453]  But that's what the New World Order is about.
[01:24:36.513 --> 01:24:47.003]  It's about internationalizing, where now you have a $50 fine misdemeanor, and you can't go to Canada because you're in a terror database the FBI puts you in.
[01:24:47.043 --> 01:24:48.945]  I mean, that's mainstream news today.
[01:24:51.292 --> 01:24:53.274]  I've been to Europe.
[01:24:53.314 --> 01:24:54.434]  I used to go there every year.
[01:24:54.454 --> 01:24:56.036]  I was attacked in England.
[01:24:56.256 --> 01:25:00.599]  There were American intelligence, military intelligence.
[01:25:00.739 --> 01:25:01.660]  They were hovering around.
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:02.740]  I was attacked there.
[01:25:03.801 --> 01:25:07.164]  When I went to Ireland, they left me alone pretty well, but they still did listen.
[01:25:07.184 --> 01:25:10.466]  They're working through the local police to tell them stories about me.
[01:25:10.686 --> 01:25:11.006]  Sure, ma'am.
[01:25:11.026 --> 01:25:11.967]  I appreciate your call.
[01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:14.689]  Tell them stories about you.
[01:25:17.097 --> 01:25:21.100]  Again, it's a global police state, ma'am, so it sounds like you know more about Europe than I do.
[01:25:21.841 --> 01:25:24.583]  I mean, Switzerland, they'll let you in if you've got enough money.
[01:25:25.624 --> 01:25:29.106]  Places like that have pretty high standards of liberty and freedom.
[01:25:30.167 --> 01:25:32.369]  But it's all getting bad, okay?
[01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:33.850]  Alrighty then.
[01:25:34.450 --> 01:25:35.431]  Mark in Texas.
[01:25:35.551 --> 01:25:36.492]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:25:36.532 --> 01:25:36.972]  Go ahead.
[01:25:37.993 --> 01:25:38.293]  Alex!
[01:25:38.754 --> 01:25:39.014]  Yes.
[01:25:39.835 --> 01:25:40.535]  How are you doing?
[01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:40.855]  Good.
[01:25:40.895 --> 01:25:41.396]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:25:42.023 --> 01:25:48.005]  Alright, what I'm doing is I'm working on waking people up to the fluoridation problem.
[01:25:49.665 --> 01:25:53.546]  And I've got a Freedom From Fluoride site on meetup.com.
[01:25:54.466 --> 01:26:03.809]  And in an effort to do that, what I've started is a project, it's a call to action, it's a protest fluoride video project.
[01:26:04.749 --> 01:26:08.930]  I'm asking people to make videos and or animations protesting water fluoride.
[01:26:09.884 --> 01:26:31.311]  Now I've got some underground animations that I found from the Underground Fluoride Network where there's a gorilla telling you the fluoride facts and there's these two girls telling you fluoride facts and if you go to meetup.com and just put in safe water or just safe, my group is Freedom From Fluoride.
[01:26:32.879 --> 01:26:35.981]  And you can see the underground videos there on the homepage.
[01:26:36.281 --> 01:26:36.681]  I hear you.
[01:26:36.701 --> 01:26:37.622]  I appreciate your call.
[01:26:37.902 --> 01:26:39.523]  I'm trying to find out about Ed and Elaine Brown.
[01:26:39.543 --> 01:26:43.485]  That's why we opened the phones up earlier to find out if anybody has any information.
[01:26:43.525 --> 01:26:45.266]  People are out calling, checking into things.
[01:26:45.566 --> 01:26:47.167]  We do a lot of fluoride shows, sir.
[01:26:47.207 --> 01:26:50.768]  We also have open phones routinely, so you can call in about any subject you want.
[01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:55.571]  Yeah, there are thousands of different groups on the web fighting the fact that fluoride's deadly poison.
[01:26:56.449 --> 01:26:57.590]  We're good to go.
[01:27:17.654 --> 01:27:18.694]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[01:27:40.091 --> 01:27:40.631]  I sure can.
[01:27:40.651 --> 01:27:45.634]  Okay, Alex, I'm calling because I'm very, very upset with the movement right now.
[01:27:46.034 --> 01:27:55.458]  How everyone's pointing fingers about you're a Zionist Jew, Dave von Kleist is a Zionist Jew, and Jason Bermas is a Jew, and Mossad.
[01:27:55.698 --> 01:28:02.921]  You know what people in this movement need to do is stop pointing fingers because COINTELPRO is very effective at the moment.
[01:28:02.941 --> 01:28:05.262]  It's working right now, sir.
[01:28:05.682 --> 01:28:06.703]  It's working right now.
[01:28:07.343 --> 01:28:08.184]  It's working right now.
[01:28:08.224 --> 01:28:09.064]  I appreciate your call.
[01:28:09.833 --> 01:28:11.494]  Don't you understand that's how it works?
[01:28:12.615 --> 01:28:18.378]  They go out and they say something about somebody, then they defend themselves instead of covering issues.
[01:28:19.058 --> 01:28:21.039]  And then people say, what's he talking about?
[01:28:21.139 --> 01:28:25.121]  And then they go look into it, and then the whole thing continues to go downhill.
[01:28:26.542 --> 01:28:28.003]  We're here fighting the New World Order.
[01:28:28.043 --> 01:28:29.184]  We're here exposing it.
[01:28:30.044 --> 01:28:38.649]  And we're here waking up new people that are tuning in every day and setting them on the path of finding out more and investigating.
[01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:41.012]  Uh, so I appreciate your call.
[01:28:41.092 --> 01:28:41.833]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.134 --> 01:28:44.075]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.556 --> 01:28:46.138]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.158 --> 01:28:49.782]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.152 --> 01:28:53.833]  It's a fact.
[01:28:54.013 --> 01:29:01.558]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:29:01.658 --> 01:29:10.204]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, all debt has become mathematically impossible to repay, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:29:10.464 --> 01:29:21.092]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:29:21.332 --> 01:29:27.457]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:29:27.677 --> 01:29:32.740]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:37.424]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:29:37.624 --> 01:29:39.425]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:29:39.485 --> 01:29:39.745]  That's 877-943-8600.
[01:29:39.765 --> 01:29:40.266]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:29:40.286 --> 01:29:42.167]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:29:53.394 --> 01:29:56.336]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:29:56.496 --> 01:30:01.739]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:30:02.019 --> 01:30:07.302]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:30:07.702 --> 01:30:08.863]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:09.203 --> 01:30:18.108]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:30:18.528 --> 01:30:20.129]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.

[01:31:24.338 --> 01:31:26.819]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:31:27.279 --> 01:31:29.179]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:31:29.899 --> 01:31:33.060]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:40.182]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[01:31:56.128 --> 01:32:11.155]  Jim Brostert is our guest.
[01:32:12.136 --> 01:32:16.598]  Last week, he saw a Mexican flag.
[01:32:16.618 --> 01:32:20.300]  There's photos of it up on the web all over the place and up on our websites.
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:33.022]  Flying above the American flag, and local media had already been talking about it, and when the TV crew got out there, he was there and had cut it down, and was saying he wasn't going to give it back.
[01:32:33.542 --> 01:32:37.763]  And people said, some people said, on our message boards, well, you know, that's free speech!
[01:32:38.943 --> 01:32:49.265]  And, whereas I agree it is, the point is that all over the country, the illegal aliens are flying their Mexican flags, they're saying this is Mexico,
[01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:53.181]  Uh, they're desecrating the American flag, flying it above it.
[01:32:53.221 --> 01:32:54.821]  So I understand why he did this.
[01:32:55.002 --> 01:33:01.583]  And the illegal aliens are going around to post offices and public schools and cutting the Stars and Stripes down.
[01:33:03.324 --> 01:33:06.065]  And they don't ever get in trouble for that.
[01:33:06.525 --> 01:33:07.405]  And stomping on them.
[01:33:07.425 --> 01:33:10.586]  We list all these examples in the article we wrote for Infowars.net.
[01:33:12.367 --> 01:33:16.228]  So, uh, it's just amazing what happened.
[01:33:19.739 --> 01:33:23.962]  I hear in the case of what's going on there in Northern Nevada.
[01:33:24.523 --> 01:33:26.904]  I appreciate you coming on with us sir.
[01:33:27.445 --> 01:33:28.786]  Thank you for having me Alex.
[01:33:29.826 --> 01:33:35.350]  Jim, I mean I know in a three minute newscast we miss a lot of what actually developed.
[01:33:35.370 --> 01:33:38.813]  When did you first learn about this and from your own perspective what happened?
[01:33:39.835 --> 01:33:45.118]  I first learned about this, Alex, listening to KOH Talk Radio with Bill Manders.
[01:33:45.178 --> 01:33:46.718]  He had a talk show host on there.
[01:33:48.479 --> 01:33:59.504]  That lady came on and was very distraught about the fact that our Stars and Stripes was being one-upped by the Mexican flag and nobody was doing anything.
[01:34:00.999 --> 01:34:02.759]  Now, you're a Vietnam veteran, correct?
[01:34:03.079 --> 01:34:03.520]  Yes, sir.
[01:34:03.860 --> 01:34:04.060]  U.S.
[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:04.380]  Army.
[01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:06.540]  And, I mean, it's universal.
[01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:10.041]  Even folks that weren't in the military know what it means to fly your flag above another one.
[01:34:10.561 --> 01:34:10.821]  Yes.
[01:34:11.781 --> 01:34:12.361]  Yes.
[01:34:12.781 --> 01:34:18.303]  We have a nation of people that are patriotic.
[01:34:18.803 --> 01:34:30.225]  However, it seems that unfortunately in this day and age, we've, not we being us, but some of the people have lost their patriotism and the
[01:34:31.357 --> 01:34:35.359]  The actual importance of that flag and what it stands for.
[01:34:35.699 --> 01:34:39.480]  Well, the individual that put it up said he, quote, did it for the Hispanic community.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:55.306]  A, the majority of Hispanic Americans are against the illegal alien invasion, almost 70% in Gallup polls, but he means the illegal alien invaders who openly say this is Mexico, and so this is a foreigner affront to our country.
[01:34:55.326 --> 01:34:56.066]  Can you walk through?
[01:34:56.086 --> 01:34:57.247]  Please continue.
[01:34:58.027 --> 01:34:58.747]  Yes, sir.
[01:34:58.967 --> 01:35:00.268]  I immediately
[01:35:01.304 --> 01:35:10.169]  I knew that it was going to be something that I was going to do as far as relieving the American flag from the disgrace that it was placed in.
[01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:17.393]  I went out to my safe and I retrieved the tool.
[01:35:17.413 --> 01:35:21.376]  The best tool for the job was the Iraqi Freedom U.S.
[01:35:21.456 --> 01:35:26.799]  Army commemorative knife and I took that with me to
[01:35:29.002 --> 01:35:29.863]  I'm going to do the honors.
[01:35:45.525 --> 01:35:50.009]  Uh, and, and remove that flag from the disgraceful position that it's been placed in.
[01:35:50.029 --> 01:36:00.177]  Um, I parked my car a couple doors down, let the motor run, and I walked up, uh, shielding the knife from other people's views as the Spanish poured from the two buildings.
[01:36:01.198 --> 01:36:03.700]  Uh, I ignored them.
[01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:06.122]  Uh, they asked me what's happening.
[01:36:06.142 --> 01:36:07.743]  I said, you're gonna see what's happening.
[01:36:08.464 --> 01:36:14.889]  And, uh, I went over and cut the anchor on the flag, uh, makeshift flagpole, a piece of pipe up the side of a building.
[01:36:15.766 --> 01:36:28.594]  And proceeded to reel the flags in and I cut the cord that kept the American flag with the Mexican flag and I let the Mexican flag fall at my feet.
[01:36:30.855 --> 01:36:43.043]  I turned the camera and it made its way over to where I was and I gave him a short insurmisis and I walked on without any challenge whatsoever.
[01:36:43.103 --> 01:36:43.483]  I left.
[01:36:46.027 --> 01:36:48.849]  What about your statement that you wanted them to come and fight you for?
[01:36:48.869 --> 01:36:49.990]  I mean, I understand what you're saying.
[01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:51.491]  This is a military operation.
[01:36:51.551 --> 01:36:54.213]  This is saying, this is Mexico, this is ours.
[01:36:54.513 --> 01:36:56.574]  And you're saying, hey buddy, you gotta fight for that.
[01:36:56.594 --> 01:36:58.616]  Yes, exactly.
[01:36:58.676 --> 01:37:12.846]  They have taken, uh, actually think, uh, that they have actually taken something from us, uh, when in reality they're trespassing and, and, uh, and they're a disgrace to their own race and their own country.
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:21.570]  Well, all I know... They being the illegals and the supporters of the illegals, I am certainly not talking about the Hispanic people.
[01:37:22.110 --> 01:37:31.204]  I am talking about the people who would support the illegals coming to our country and the people who are the illegals.
[01:37:32.472 --> 01:37:33.513]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[01:37:33.633 --> 01:37:34.413]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:37:34.433 --> 01:37:35.634]  The country's already bankrupt.
[01:37:35.654 --> 01:37:36.915]  The dollar's being devalued.
[01:37:37.235 --> 01:37:38.415]  Everything's falling apart.
[01:37:38.675 --> 01:37:44.598]  We have giant third world hordes, on average, who take up more than double what they actually pay in taxes.
[01:37:44.898 --> 01:37:48.140]  The government's there to put them on the welfare gland.
[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:50.381]  They're there to get them into the system.
[01:37:50.901 --> 01:37:55.864]  The globalists want their North American Union, and they're using illegal aliens as their cannon fodder.
[01:37:56.284 --> 01:38:03.947]  Yes, and this is a total assault on our country, and our reaction has been to just stand by and watch this happen.
[01:38:04.367 --> 01:38:12.309]  Now my question is, are we going to continue to stand by, or are we going to reach out and start doing something about this?
[01:38:12.450 --> 01:38:17.551]  Because there's more of us than there are of them, but for some reason, they're getting away with it.
[01:38:17.771 --> 01:38:19.472]  Well, look, the bottom line is this.
[01:38:21.926 --> 01:38:26.529]  We have to ask ourselves, do we still want to be the U.S., or do we want it to die on the altar of the New World Order?
[01:38:26.569 --> 01:38:27.590]  It's not going to be Mexico.
[01:38:27.650 --> 01:38:36.236]  It's going to be a mixture, third world police state, and even if you're an illegal alien, you ought to know that's not going to be good in the end.
[01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:39.699]  The big corporations in the U.S.
[01:38:40.719 --> 01:38:42.681]  are pushing this, and have you seen
[01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:48.128]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, we're talking to Jim Brossard.
[01:38:48.508 --> 01:38:53.292]  And Jim, last week, cut down the Mexican flag that was above the American flag there in Reno, Nevada.
[01:38:54.373 --> 01:39:05.423]  For people that just joined us, just to recap that, at the bottom of the story we wrote, Steve Watson wrote for Infowars.net, Veteran Removes Illegal Mexican Flag.
[01:39:06.514 --> 01:39:09.036]  May be charged because that day they were saying they may go after him.
[01:39:15.533 --> 01:39:21.894]  At the bottom of the story, we have all the examples of it happening in Maywood, California, Tucson, Arizona, Jupiter, Florida.
[01:39:22.174 --> 01:39:33.257]  I mean, it's happened a bunch in California and Arizona, where the illegals run up the post offices, run up the schools, jerk the American flag down, stomp it, rip it, and then run up the Mexican flag.
[01:39:33.277 --> 01:39:37.757]  I mean, this is a vicious military style, and they know what they're doing.
[01:39:37.938 --> 01:39:38.918]  Hatred of this country.
[01:39:38.958 --> 01:39:40.578]  It's saying, we're going to destroy your country.
[01:39:40.898 --> 01:39:44.099]  I mean, and then the media's like, oh, they're wonderful people, but just want to be Americans.
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:48.821]  You know, the media is our worst enemy.
[01:39:49.621 --> 01:39:52.462]  They have gotten us in the position that we're in.
[01:39:52.762 --> 01:39:56.604]  And because they're sensationalists, all they care about is the story.
[01:39:57.064 --> 01:39:58.705]  And they don't care about their own nation.
[01:40:01.426 --> 01:40:02.887]  Well, did you hear about the media?
[01:40:03.027 --> 01:40:05.468]  And it was not Mexican owned, by the way, out in California.
[01:40:06.268 --> 01:40:10.970]  Putting up 600 plus, it was close to 700 signs in California.
[01:40:11.431 --> 01:40:12.311]  LA is now Mexico.
[01:40:13.539 --> 01:40:13.739]  Yes.
[01:40:14.659 --> 01:40:19.141]  I mean, this is, I mean, I live here in Austin, and I grew up with all my Mexican friends.
[01:40:19.401 --> 01:40:21.101]  I wasn't looking over my shoulder, Karen.
[01:40:21.361 --> 01:40:24.382]  And now, you know, my wife grew up and lived in Spain and in Italy.
[01:40:24.402 --> 01:40:25.482]  She speaks fluent Spanish.
[01:40:25.842 --> 01:40:27.663]  She drives around going, look at that on that store.
[01:40:27.703 --> 01:40:28.503]  Look what that says.
[01:40:28.783 --> 01:40:31.144]  She listens to Mexican radio, gets blown away by it.
[01:40:31.164 --> 01:40:32.044]  It's like, we're taking over.
[01:40:32.064 --> 01:40:32.724]  Ha ha ha.
[01:40:33.004 --> 01:40:33.785]  You'll be defeated.
[01:40:34.125 --> 01:40:38.386]  And I don't, I mean, look, I'm not going to be, I'm supposed to just sit here and act like it's not happening?
[01:40:38.826 --> 01:40:42.247]  Yeah, apparently that's what the bleeding heart liberals would have us do.
[01:40:42.927 --> 01:40:44.888]  And they are also our enemies.
[01:40:45.989 --> 01:40:58.033]  The enemies of this country are not anything other than our own people who are standing by and trying to feel sorry for the illegal aliens.
[01:40:59.209 --> 01:41:03.671]  Who, of any race, that are coming in and filtrating our country.
[01:41:04.431 --> 01:41:05.472]  When I was in the U.S.
[01:41:05.512 --> 01:41:10.114]  military, if somebody had filtrated our country like this, it was an act of war and we would have handled it.
[01:41:10.174 --> 01:41:18.778]  Now what has happened to our country to cause us to stand by and allow our system to be broken down?
[01:41:19.198 --> 01:41:23.440]  We have people driving without licenses and insurance, hitting people and running.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.902]  We have people shooting and knifing innocent people.
[01:41:27.902 --> 01:41:30.743]  Our health care system has taken a complete dump.
[01:41:30.783 --> 01:41:31.823]  Hey, it's bankrupt!
[01:41:31.863 --> 01:41:35.624]  Go back to two, three months ago, the amnesty bill.
[01:41:35.704 --> 01:41:37.124]  I read the sections on air.
[01:41:38.084 --> 01:41:45.926]  It said aggravated felony legal aliens get a pardon and five years of no income taxes.
[01:41:46.606 --> 01:41:47.306]  Good Lord.
[01:41:47.606 --> 01:41:49.466]  I mean, you cannot make this stuff up.
[01:41:49.526 --> 01:41:51.607]  It's a red carpet to these people.
[01:41:52.887 --> 01:41:53.107]  Wow.
[01:41:54.702 --> 01:41:56.384]  What does our government think they're achieving?
[01:41:56.665 --> 01:41:57.485]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:41:57.706 --> 01:42:03.573]  I mean, I would have gone out and shown it and shown the disgrace and then let it build and let the anger build.
[01:42:03.633 --> 01:42:04.574]  It would have had a bigger effect.
[01:42:04.694 --> 01:42:05.555]  I don't blame you.
[01:42:05.876 --> 01:42:10.261]  In fact, I salute you for the courage it took because, you know, it's
[01:42:10.561 --> 01:42:14.285]  People aren't criticizing the illegals when they cut down American flags, and this is America.
[01:42:14.965 --> 01:42:21.512]  But at the same time, I probably would have done it different, because I know what would have caused the most damage to these America haters.
[01:42:21.892 --> 01:42:23.914]  But, I understand and salute what you did.
[01:42:24.194 --> 01:42:33.483]  And I don't get our own listeners on our message boards going, it's the free speech, this is foreigners in our country desecrating our nation.
[01:42:34.043 --> 01:42:34.923]  I'll tell you who they are.
[01:42:34.983 --> 01:42:42.705]  They're Blade Night Liberals, and they're sitting in the comfort of their own home and listening to drive-by media, and they're believing this crap that they're hearing.
[01:42:43.186 --> 01:42:48.827]  And these people have not had their identities stolen, okay?
[01:42:50.208 --> 01:42:58.370]  They're probably living in an income bracket where they're not feeling the pinch medically, and they have total
[01:42:59.756 --> 01:43:02.418]  Disregard for what is in front of them.
[01:43:04.439 --> 01:43:09.282]  You know, when they'll wake up is when this whole thing just turns upside down.
[01:43:09.522 --> 01:43:11.863]  Well, all I'm saying is, I understand why they say free speech.
[01:43:11.903 --> 01:43:14.085]  A lot of them aren't liberals or libertarians.
[01:43:14.385 --> 01:43:16.146]  But the point is, you've got to talk real world.
[01:43:16.346 --> 01:43:18.708]  You've got a bunch of illegals milling around celebrating.
[01:43:19.408 --> 01:43:20.409]  That's what's on the news.
[01:43:20.429 --> 01:43:23.290]  You've got them praising their flag above the American flag.
[01:43:24.091 --> 01:43:29.194]  It is a direct insult, a direct vicious assault, and it's not an American doing it.
[01:43:31.035 --> 01:43:34.496]  Then also, there should never be any lack of freedom of speech.
[01:43:35.196 --> 01:43:40.318]  But when it involves a flag assembly, that's not freedom of speech.
[01:43:40.359 --> 01:43:42.319]  What they are doing is an act of war.
[01:43:42.659 --> 01:43:44.520]  That's not a freedom of speech symbol.
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:45.761]  That is an act of war symbol.
[01:43:45.781 --> 01:43:50.303]  People don't understand, though, that there is international... I mean, the first laws were based on flags.
[01:43:50.343 --> 01:43:51.003]  They're symbols.
[01:43:51.423 --> 01:43:52.503]  And it's saying something.
[01:43:52.544 --> 01:43:56.285]  And it's saying, we declare war on you, and you're a veteran, you know what it means.
[01:43:56.565 --> 01:43:58.386]  The public doesn't know what that means.
[01:43:59.401 --> 01:44:01.722]  It means we're going to bring your country down.
[01:44:01.762 --> 01:44:02.722]  This is Mexico.
[01:44:02.962 --> 01:44:03.662]  We hate you.
[01:44:04.002 --> 01:44:05.243]  But why is that Alex?
[01:44:05.323 --> 01:44:13.245]  I think it's because we have so many people that are numbed to the things that are going on in today's society.
[01:44:13.905 --> 01:44:16.646]  There's so much strife.
[01:44:16.686 --> 01:44:18.627]  There's the child pornography.
[01:44:19.887 --> 01:44:21.828]  You know, and where does all that come from?
[01:44:21.948 --> 01:44:27.009]  It comes from lack of priorities, lack of integrity.
[01:44:27.749 --> 01:44:30.930]  How has the integrity been breached?
[01:44:31.010 --> 01:44:31.610]  What happened?
[01:44:31.650 --> 01:44:37.052]  Well, you know, the homosexuals are just normal sexual people.
[01:44:37.372 --> 01:44:38.412]  No, that's not normal.
[01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:41.373]  There's nothing normal about homosexuality.
[01:44:41.473 --> 01:44:42.433]  It is a perversion.
[01:44:42.453 --> 01:44:43.934]  It is an act of perversion.
[01:44:43.954 --> 01:44:49.055]  And quite simply, it's a breakdown of our belief system.
[01:44:49.455 --> 01:44:50.676]  Well, sir, I'll say this.
[01:44:50.736 --> 01:44:51.376]  I'll say this.
[01:44:51.476 --> 01:44:59.459]  That, along with many more things, Alex, has broken down and numbed the people where they don't react when something like this happens.
[01:44:59.839 --> 01:45:00.520]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:08.503]  The public has certainly been numbed, and I understand your anger at what happened here, but I would add, you see, bleeding-heart liberals, George Bush is for blanket, complete amnesty.
[01:45:09.665 --> 01:45:10.245]  Oh my God.
[01:45:10.525 --> 01:45:13.066]  Yeah, that couldn't be more wrong.
[01:45:13.086 --> 01:45:16.266]  I mean, that's my point, is that both parties... And I love George Bush.
[01:45:16.326 --> 01:45:17.427]  I love our president.
[01:45:17.747 --> 01:45:19.107]  But that couldn't be more wrong.
[01:45:19.307 --> 01:45:22.268]  And I, you know, and I completely agree.
[01:45:22.288 --> 01:45:24.008]  See, I mean, you're a conservative.
[01:45:24.488 --> 01:45:26.149]  How have you been numbed?
[01:45:26.169 --> 01:45:34.630]  How did you, like, still accept that Bush tripled the size of the BATF, openly wants amnesty, trying to ram it through?
[01:45:34.690 --> 01:45:37.271]  I mean, we have to address these issues.
[01:45:38.015 --> 01:45:38.736]  Yes, we do.
[01:45:39.076 --> 01:45:50.746]  And we need to face the people like Harry Reid and those people that are on his side because he's the deterioration of our country.
[01:45:51.266 --> 01:45:53.968]  He's leading the deterioration of our country.
[01:45:54.249 --> 01:45:59.073]  Jim Brossard, I appreciate you coming on the show and I understand why you did what you did.
[01:45:59.113 --> 01:46:00.394]  I'm glad it didn't end violently.
[01:46:01.254 --> 01:46:04.417]  I'm glad someone didn't come out to fight you there.
[01:46:04.437 --> 01:46:06.900]  I'm not a violent person, but I wouldn't have backed down.
[01:46:16.148 --> 01:46:18.470]  All those people are upset that you pulled down a Mexican flag.
[01:46:18.490 --> 01:46:21.373]  What about how the American flag keeps getting pulled down?
[01:46:21.814 --> 01:46:34.285]  I encourage all people to act in the manner in which I did, and it's not improper, and if it is unlawful, what about all the laws that are being broken by the illegals?
[01:46:34.565 --> 01:46:35.386]  What about those?
[01:46:35.847 --> 01:46:39.930]  And what about the fact that these flags were in support of those?
[01:46:42.412 --> 01:46:48.336]  Don't these people feel anything for their own countrymen that are having their identities stolen?
[01:46:49.577 --> 01:46:50.558]  I know it's very serious.
[01:46:50.598 --> 01:46:53.000]  Thank you for coming on with us, Jimmy.
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:54.601]  You haven't heard from the police?
[01:46:55.699 --> 01:46:56.379]  Yes, I have.
[01:46:56.439 --> 01:46:58.300]  Reno Police did respond.
[01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:07.723]  They simply wanted to make sure that I wasn't some violent person that was going to do anything else, and I assured them that that certainly wasn't the case.
[01:47:07.783 --> 01:47:09.283]  Did they call you or come out to your place?
[01:47:09.583 --> 01:47:17.585]  They came to my place, left a card on my door, and I responded on the phone and talked to the Sergeant in the Detective's Division.
[01:47:17.605 --> 01:47:17.985]  Very nice man.
[01:47:20.761 --> 01:47:23.163]  Understood what my point was.
[01:47:23.463 --> 01:47:37.153]  I did say that there could be charges if that person chose to file them and that the Hispanic leaders of the community were trying to encourage them to do so, but of course it doesn't appear like that's happened.
[01:47:38.634 --> 01:47:41.796]  I do have information for a...
[01:47:44.867 --> 01:47:50.411]  I have information for a support for Jim Brossard Freedom Fund.
[01:47:50.471 --> 01:47:55.154]  If somebody wanted to, that way I have something to access if something happens.
[01:47:56.515 --> 01:47:57.936]  Is that a website or an address?
[01:47:58.977 --> 01:48:01.979]  No, it's actually, I haven't got my website set up.
[01:48:02.039 --> 01:48:10.245]  I'm not sure how to do that, so I'm learning all of this stuff, but I set up a bank account that will be solely utilized for the
[01:48:12.624 --> 01:48:19.308]  Well, if we hear about you getting arrested or in trouble, it'll do the Jim Brossard Freedom Fund, and that's in Reno, Nevada?
[01:48:19.588 --> 01:48:20.489]  Yeah, with U.S.
[01:48:20.549 --> 01:48:20.869]  Bank.
[01:48:21.829 --> 01:48:22.190]  Okay, fine.
[01:48:22.710 --> 01:48:25.572]  And if you want, I have the routing number and account number.
[01:48:25.652 --> 01:48:26.412]  I can give you that.
[01:48:26.672 --> 01:48:27.333]  Sure, give it out.
[01:48:28.013 --> 01:48:29.314]  Okay.
[01:48:29.574 --> 01:48:30.495]  Routing number is 121201694.
[01:48:30.535 --> 01:48:31.635]  Account number is 15.
[01:48:40.299 --> 01:48:40.960]  I don't know.
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:49:03.342]  Well, listen, if you get arrested, which is unlikely, then people can support you.
[01:49:03.702 --> 01:49:05.483]  This wouldn't just be for that.
[01:49:05.543 --> 01:49:08.244]  This is actually the further I'm going to keep fighting.
[01:49:08.264 --> 01:49:12.085]  I'm trying to move on this and keep this.
[01:49:12.245 --> 01:49:15.746]  This needs to be a movement, not just with me, but it needs to incorporate others.
[01:49:17.126 --> 01:49:17.566]  I hear you.
[01:49:17.947 --> 01:49:18.687]  We've got to go to break.
[01:49:18.727 --> 01:49:20.007]  I really appreciate you coming on, Jim.
[01:49:20.487 --> 01:49:21.328]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:49:21.628 --> 01:49:21.908]  You bet.
[01:49:21.948 --> 01:49:22.328]  Take care.
[01:49:23.533 --> 01:49:30.017]  Folks, nice fella, but there's an example of how he's completely blinded by the left-right paradigm.
[01:49:31.578 --> 01:49:37.881]  He loves George Bush, but George Bush is the one dismantling this country as a puppet for the globalists, and Hillary will follow in the exact same footsteps.
[01:49:38.162 --> 01:49:45.006]  She'll do the exact same thing, and then suddenly the left will love her, and then suddenly, it's just, they keep playing us like fools.
[01:49:45.706 --> 01:49:47.087]  I'm just glad that didn't end violent.
[01:49:47.407 --> 01:49:51.369]  I'm gonna come back, get into a bunch of other news, and then more of your phone calls.
[01:49:51.409 --> 01:49:52.570]  I'm gonna get to the Ron Paul news.
[01:49:56.366 --> 01:50:01.851]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.211 --> 01:50:09.838]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.532 --> 01:50:17.596]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.996 --> 01:50:29.402]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.722 --> 01:50:33.284]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.685 --> 01:50:35.646]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.946 --> 01:50:39.808]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.059 --> 01:51:03.123]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:03.383 --> 01:51:14.607]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:14.927 --> 01:51:19.949]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[01:51:20.009 --> 01:51:20.209]  I think so.
[01:51:38.991 --> 01:51:40.633]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:51:40.673 --> 01:51:41.535]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:41.575 --> 01:51:41.875]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:41.935 --> 01:51:43.337]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:52.990 --> 01:52:01.053]  Hi, this is Jeff Rentsch, and if you're interested in suppressed natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[01:52:01.533 --> 01:52:10.817]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[01:52:11.297 --> 01:52:15.599]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[01:52:16.207 --> 01:52:28.272]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineral-like compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery and arthritis.
[01:52:28.792 --> 01:52:33.714]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[01:52:34.194 --> 01:52:36.695]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound.
[01:52:36.755 --> 01:52:37.575]  And the best part?
[01:52:38.056 --> 01:52:39.516]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[01:52:39.596 --> 01:52:41.317]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[01:52:41.437 --> 01:52:43.558]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[01:52:44.438 --> 01:52:44.838]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[01:52:44.878 --> 01:52:45.699]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:52:45.759 --> 01:52:51.041]  We've gotten quite a few reports from multiple listeners that they found an Ed Brown in a federal prison.
[01:53:14.048 --> 01:53:14.870]  In Kentucky.
[01:53:15.532 --> 01:53:16.514]  Ashland, Kentucky.
[01:53:16.975 --> 01:53:23.930]  But that shows him getting out in 2017 on his current conviction instead of 2012 when he supposedly gets out.
[01:53:25.049 --> 01:53:26.710]  So that's probably another Ed Brown.
[01:53:26.730 --> 01:53:29.671]  We're trying to track that down and confirm that right now.
[01:53:29.691 --> 01:53:31.292]  More of your calls coming up in the next hour.
[01:53:31.672 --> 01:53:34.773]  Let me right now get into the dollar news as we continue to track this.
[01:53:35.613 --> 01:53:41.856]  Don't forget, in-game blueprint for global enslavement, the new world order master plan to exterminate 80% of humanity.
[01:53:42.576 --> 01:53:44.717]  And by the way, for all the feds and people listening,
[01:53:45.785 --> 01:53:46.806]  That means you later.
[01:53:46.886 --> 01:53:55.473]  That means after more terror attacks, more control, more constrictions over the next few decades, maybe even sooner, controlled bioweapons releases.
[01:53:55.573 --> 01:53:56.954]  Just remember who did it to you.
[01:53:57.354 --> 01:53:59.616]  Remember who your bosses are later.
[01:53:59.716 --> 01:54:05.300]  And as soon as you find out about your paycheck being worth half of what it was, that hasn't fully come into effect yet.
[01:54:05.961 --> 01:54:08.783]  Usually with inflation, it shows up a few years after.
[01:54:08.803 --> 01:54:09.964]  Now we're starting to hit that point.
[01:54:10.765 --> 01:54:12.106]  Just remember, we didn't do that.
[01:54:12.166 --> 01:54:14.187]  Your bosses did.
[01:54:16.513 --> 01:54:17.734]  Because the New World Order is real.
[01:54:17.774 --> 01:54:23.376]  I know your federal training manuals say it doesn't exist, but we happen to have all the memoirs in the New World Order where they admit it all.
[01:54:25.417 --> 01:54:28.839]  Congressman, dollar could collapse to absolute zero.
[01:54:29.639 --> 01:54:34.522]  Presidential candidate Ron Paul warns of coming global economic depression.
[01:54:35.862 --> 01:54:37.963]  And he said that it could collapse to zero.
[01:54:38.023 --> 01:54:41.065]  It's already collapsed by 62% in value against the euro.
[01:54:42.336 --> 01:54:46.660]  And then I was reading some of the Dig comments, and it says, no one is above fear-mongering.
[01:54:49.443 --> 01:54:58.591]  And other message boards are saying, oh, that's ridiculous, the dollar's not being devalued, oh, that's just more of those twofers, more of those crazy libertarians.
[01:55:01.354 --> 01:55:05.998]  It's big headlines the last few years, all over Europe, all over Asia, all over the Middle East, all over Latin America.
[01:55:07.848 --> 01:55:11.575]  Just a few years ago, the Canadian loonie was at 65 cents to the dollar.
[01:55:11.615 --> 01:55:12.797]  Now it's worth more than a dollar.
[01:55:13.318 --> 01:55:14.641]  Listen to me.
[01:55:15.482 --> 01:55:16.885]  This is a big deal.
[01:55:16.965 --> 01:55:18.167]  You're being robbed.
[01:55:19.429 --> 01:55:20.531]  Here's the headline today.
[01:55:20.631 --> 01:55:20.892]  Golf
[01:55:21.630 --> 01:55:36.242]  Funds drift away from the dollar due by asset diversification by the Gulf sovereign wealth funds and the probability that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, will change the pricing of oil from the dollar to another currency could mean more trouble for the dollar.
[01:55:36.382 --> 01:55:41.085]  And Saudi Arabia is already moving away from the dollar, not pegging their currency to the dollar.
[01:55:41.506 --> 01:55:42.627]  Venezuela has dumped it.
[01:55:42.987 --> 01:55:45.469]  A whole bunch of Asian countries dumped it last week.
[01:55:46.394 --> 01:55:59.178]  And you got the neocons, a month ago we wrote a story about this and they were on the message board going, on the Dig comment section going, you're trying to destroy the economy, shut up, it's not a problem, George Bush is good.
[01:56:00.099 --> 01:56:01.259]  George Bush runs nothing.
[01:56:01.279 --> 01:56:06.961]  Okay, when the Federal Reserve a month ago came out, three weeks ago, and said the dollar is going to plunge, it started plunging even more.
[01:56:07.281 --> 01:56:08.542]  They're trying to kill it.
[01:56:09.022 --> 01:56:10.562]  What can't you understand?
[01:56:10.602 --> 01:56:12.203]  Your savings, everything.
[01:56:14.264 --> 01:56:18.265]  The feds don't care, they're just... I'm glad we're arrested, Ed Brown.
[01:56:18.285 --> 01:56:18.365]  Yeah.
[01:56:19.366 --> 01:56:20.886]  Our government loves us.
[01:56:21.006 --> 01:56:22.287]  Everything's fine.
[01:56:23.107 --> 01:56:23.467]  Oh yeah?
[01:56:23.487 --> 01:56:26.208]  You've had half your value robbed out of your account, you idiots.
[01:56:27.208 --> 01:56:28.288]  This is so stupid!
[01:56:28.308 --> 01:56:29.569]  The Newell Order's our enemy!
[01:56:29.609 --> 01:56:30.789]  Can't you figure that out?
[01:56:31.569 --> 01:56:33.270]  They're the ones destroying the country!
[01:56:35.584 --> 01:56:45.246]  Asset diversification by the Gulf Sovereign Wealth Funds, the possibility the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will change the pricing of oil from the dollar to other currency could mean more trouble for the dollar.
[01:56:45.306 --> 01:56:52.328]  The dollar has been losing its charm as a reserve currency due to its persistent weakness against a host of other international currencies.
[01:56:52.868 --> 01:56:59.290]  The September non-farm payrolls report Friday showed 110,000 jobs were created in the U.S.
[01:56:59.670 --> 01:57:04.871]  last month, although the dollar reacted positively to the news and gained initially, the rally quickly fizzled.
[01:57:06.212 --> 01:57:19.643]  Amid the dollar's free fall following a half percent interest rate cut in September, Qatar last week paid another 50 billion sovereign wealth funds, cut its exposure to the dollar by more than half to about 40 percent of its portfolio.
[01:57:20.263 --> 01:57:20.664]  Alert!
[01:57:20.864 --> 01:57:21.204]  Alert!
[01:57:21.284 --> 01:57:22.605]  Danger, Will Robertson!
[01:57:22.665 --> 01:57:23.106]  Danger!
[01:57:23.466 --> 01:57:25.528]  Meanwhile, the yuppies are going, Shut up!
[01:57:25.608 --> 01:57:27.449]  It's a conspiracy theory!
[01:57:27.789 --> 01:57:29.291]  It doesn't exist!
[01:57:29.471 --> 01:57:30.772]  Everything's fine!
[01:57:33.123 --> 01:57:38.186]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.226 --> 01:57:38.566]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.586 --> 01:57:39.067]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.267 --> 01:57:39.727]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:39.747 --> 01:57:40.287]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.718 --> 01:57:56.579]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.599 --> 01:58:01.144]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.465 --> 01:58:05.569]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.372 --> 01:58:09.474]  Later in the show, we'll open the phones up.
[01:58:09.794 --> 01:58:10.275]  I know we've got
[01:58:11.269 --> 01:58:25.722]  Tens of thousands of our millions of listeners out there scouring the Federal Registries, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Larry Becraft, constitutional lawyer, top of his class, expert on the New World Order, joining us in 30 minutes to talk about the Ed and Elaine Brown seizure.
[01:58:26.743 --> 01:58:28.244]  Brown in a black hole somewhere.
[01:58:28.265 --> 01:58:28.725]  Elaine is in
[01:58:30.848 --> 01:58:33.830]  Connecticut in a federal women's prison in Danbury.
[01:58:34.691 --> 01:58:37.953]  We don't know where Ed is, no doubt being tortured with an inch of his life.
[01:58:37.993 --> 01:58:41.075]  That's standard operating procedure for this criminal government.
[01:58:42.617 --> 01:58:43.257]  Oh, man.
[01:58:44.018 --> 01:58:45.779]  It's just a bad situation.
[01:58:45.799 --> 01:58:54.665]  I was just talking about the dollar and how a bunch of the, well, not a bunch, all the Gulf states are moving rapidly away from the dollar.
[01:58:55.266 --> 01:58:58.628]  In the last month, on average, they dumped more than 20%
[01:59:01.065 --> 01:59:02.786]  of their funds in dollars.
[01:59:03.506 --> 01:59:06.287]  There is a mass exodus happening right now.
[01:59:06.327 --> 01:59:11.489]  The country, if it was a B-17 Stratofortress, is on fire.
[01:59:11.529 --> 01:59:12.229]  The crew is dead.
[01:59:12.269 --> 01:59:13.710]  It's smoking, plunging downward.
[01:59:15.070 --> 01:59:17.971]  Meanwhile, illegal aliens are running around waving Mexican flags.
[01:59:18.071 --> 01:59:30.656]  Feds are running around arresting citizens for crooked toenails, young kids for marijuana, the government shipping in masses of narcotics, money laundering, criminality, wall-to-wall, 30-plus percent of people on death row innocent,
[01:59:33.021 --> 01:59:35.243]  Over $4 trillion now missing from the Pentagon.
[01:59:35.283 --> 01:59:36.944]  I keep saying close to $4 trillion.
[01:59:36.964 --> 01:59:37.885]  It's now over $4 trillion.
[01:59:38.485 --> 01:59:40.647]  Just massive corruption everywhere.
[01:59:40.667 --> 01:59:45.230]  Derivatives over $100 plus trillion dollars.
[01:59:45.771 --> 01:59:49.013]  Just total la la land in the financial markets.
[01:59:49.353 --> 01:59:57.660]  And the globalist answer is gearing up with massive police state crackdown models, huge FEMA camps, openly announcing they may set up martial law, forced inoculations.
[01:59:58.260 --> 02:00:00.722]  I mean, we're just total fruitcake land.
[02:00:02.248 --> 02:00:04.129]  We have now entered total fruitcake land.
[02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:06.691]  And the yuppies have no idea.
[02:00:06.751 --> 02:00:12.495]  They're running around talking about their favorite sports team, running around just mindlessly gibbering like monkeys.
[02:00:13.475 --> 02:00:16.777]  And I mean, I don't even know what to say right now.
[02:00:16.797 --> 02:00:19.939]  I cannot describe to you how bad it is.
[02:00:20.059 --> 02:00:22.661]  I cannot describe to you how insane it is.
[02:00:23.584 --> 02:00:28.487]  They are going to butcher this country, bring us down to total third world status, and they know you're going to squeal and yell.
[02:00:28.948 --> 02:00:33.090]  And if you flail, they're going to have goons pay minimum wage, beat your brains in.
[02:00:33.590 --> 02:00:37.633]  And that'll probably cause fights and resistance.
[02:00:38.113 --> 02:00:40.035]  There's probably no doubt that's going to happen.
[02:00:40.075 --> 02:00:48.300]  And that just escalates it into hell on earth, and it's not good for anybody, except the Rothschilds and a few other scum groups.
[02:00:50.007 --> 02:00:58.493]  It's more like entertainment for them to watch the destruction of this country that's always been... Enemies.
[02:00:58.513 --> 02:01:01.535]  I'm a little distracted.
[02:01:01.595 --> 02:01:03.437]  I just came here and said my cousin wants to call me.
[02:01:03.457 --> 02:01:04.097]  That's important.
[02:01:04.117 --> 02:01:04.978]  I don't know what that's about.
[02:01:04.998 --> 02:01:06.899]  I have to call him during the break.
[02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:10.662]  It's just... Oh gosh.
[02:01:11.022 --> 02:01:12.323]  I don't know what to do anymore.
[02:01:13.724 --> 02:01:14.104]  I don't know.
[02:01:15.185 --> 02:01:17.667]  It's just... We had to go bad as a country.
[02:01:18.542 --> 02:01:20.823]  Like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Russians.
[02:01:21.764 --> 02:01:26.887]  I mean, feds and police could decide to not be part of this now and really have an awakening in your ranks, but you don't.
[02:01:26.947 --> 02:01:33.830]  You watch football all the time and go home and watch Jack Bauer and fantasize and there's no real Al-Qaeda to fight, so it's going to be us.
[02:01:33.930 --> 02:01:37.873]  At the end of the day, you'll have no future either.
[02:01:37.893 --> 02:01:38.713]  Man.
[02:01:38.833 --> 02:01:43.616]  I just can't believe it had to happen this way.
[02:01:45.602 --> 02:01:47.323]  I wish we could avert all these things happening.
[02:01:47.363 --> 02:01:50.625]  We get back, FBI puts anti-war protesters on criminal database.
[02:01:50.665 --> 02:01:53.267]  Canada uses it to ban protesters from entry.
[02:01:54.207 --> 02:01:55.908]  Shitties want cameras in our homes.
[02:01:57.929 --> 02:01:59.430]  Britain on board for U.S.
[02:01:59.490 --> 02:02:00.471]  airstrikes in Iran.
[02:02:00.511 --> 02:02:01.832]  I'll cover that first.
[02:02:04.253 --> 02:02:07.375]  Police track down deputy who stormed party, killed six people.
[02:02:07.415 --> 02:02:08.956]  I'll cover that after I cover the war news.
[02:02:10.497 --> 02:02:10.917]  Flickr.
[02:02:11.897 --> 02:02:14.379]  It's F-L-I-C-K-R.
[02:02:15.313 --> 02:02:16.914]  They got disinfo on me here.
[02:02:16.934 --> 02:02:18.174]  This is how they run their ops.
[02:02:18.254 --> 02:02:19.275]  I think I'll mention that.
[02:02:19.295 --> 02:02:20.635]  It's because it's an education.
[02:02:20.655 --> 02:02:21.576]  I don't think it's about me.
[02:02:22.596 --> 02:02:29.619]  And I got a bunch of other news here too that we haven't even gotten to yet today.
[02:02:30.539 --> 02:02:31.440]  So stay with us.
[02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:33.000]  Cell phone towers.
[02:02:33.861 --> 02:02:36.182]  Cell phones themselves frying everybody's brains.
[02:02:36.222 --> 02:02:37.042]  Mainstream news.
[02:02:37.102 --> 02:02:38.522]  Massive tumors exploding.
[02:02:38.542 --> 02:02:41.404]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:02:41.544 --> 02:02:41.984]  Stay with us.
[02:02:46.664 --> 02:02:47.704]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:02:48.025 --> 02:02:50.806]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:02:51.086 --> 02:02:55.227]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:02:55.668 --> 02:02:56.488]  So what do you do?
[02:02:56.808 --> 02:03:01.370]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:03.992]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:03:04.473 --> 02:03:05.373]  Sheltering in Place!
[02:03:05.774 --> 02:03:19.186]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:03:19.226 --> 02:03:26.273]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:03:26.633 --> 02:03:31.016]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[02:03:33.278 --> 02:03:33.498]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:03:47.902 --> 02:03:53.386]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:53.746 --> 02:04:01.391]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.085 --> 02:04:09.148]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.548 --> 02:04:20.933]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.273 --> 02:04:24.835]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.195 --> 02:04:27.136]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.496 --> 02:04:31.338]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:04:31.938 --> 02:04:43.928]  Get your copy today on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:04:44.608 --> 02:04:52.074]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry and I'm a plastic surgeon and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[02:04:52.254 --> 02:04:54.756]  But I want to tell you today about a product that I developed.
[02:04:54.796 --> 02:04:59.760]  It's called Night Skin and it helps your skin look younger without needles, without acid peels,
[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:00.380]  We're good to go!
[02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:32.460]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:32.581 --> 02:05:33.741]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.441 --> 02:06:20.875]  I could talk for three hours about the major Swiss, Dutch, British, American studies on what cell phone towers are doing to our children and what the cell phones themselves are doing to the population.
[02:06:21.876 --> 02:06:26.720]  I could talk all day about mercenaries and what they mean to our country and why Blackwater is in so much trouble.
[02:06:28.044 --> 02:06:37.530]  Yeah, this is a subject I should get a bunch of scientists on about and just go through the hundreds of articles and hundreds of studies and just do weeks and weeks of this until everybody gets out of the habit of using them.
[02:06:37.630 --> 02:06:38.591]  I still use cell phones.
[02:06:38.671 --> 02:06:40.072]  I always lose the hands-free.
[02:06:41.272 --> 02:06:42.073]  I've cut back about 95%.
[02:06:42.473 --> 02:06:44.794]  I watch my family use them.
[02:06:44.814 --> 02:06:47.456]  There's no doubt you get giant tumors right where you use the phone.
[02:06:47.876 --> 02:06:51.819]  And I see children everywhere using it and no one's going to stop because we're weak!
[02:06:54.924 --> 02:07:01.427]  And we're preconditioned that anything that could be threatening to our bodies that the government or media puts out is impossible in a conspiracy theory.
[02:07:02.407 --> 02:07:03.628]  It's preconditioning.
[02:07:04.108 --> 02:07:06.909]  Mobile phone cancer risk higher for children, London Telegraph.
[02:07:07.289 --> 02:07:13.472]  Children should not be given mobile phones because using them for more than 10 years increases the risk of brain cancer, a leading scientist has said.
[02:07:15.111 --> 02:07:27.398]  People who have used their phone for a decade are twice as likely to be diagnosed with a tumor on the nerve connecting to the ear to the brain, according to a group of scientists who have surveyed the results of 11 different studies.
[02:07:28.078 --> 02:07:29.159]  Folks, it just gets worse.
[02:07:29.179 --> 02:07:31.320]  I mean, I just, we're in deep trouble!
[02:07:33.041 --> 02:07:35.963]  Do you know what plastic does?
[02:07:36.723 --> 02:07:43.207]  Even the more expensive plastics, leach dioxin and leach female hormones, are hormones that mimic it.
[02:07:44.056 --> 02:07:46.537]  And I can't stop eating out of plastic.
[02:07:47.757 --> 02:07:50.158]  I can't stop eating out of paper coated in plastic.
[02:07:50.678 --> 02:07:52.419]  I can't stop giving it to my children.
[02:07:52.459 --> 02:07:54.840]  They don't make baby bottles without it.
[02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:56.980]  I can't even stop!
[02:07:59.061 --> 02:08:00.161]  I'm mad at myself!
[02:08:00.281 --> 02:08:01.202]  We're idiots!
[02:08:05.143 --> 02:08:07.604]  We have got to get control of the water we drink.
[02:08:08.124 --> 02:08:10.565]  We've got to get control of the food we eat.
[02:08:12.173 --> 02:08:13.614]  I mean, I talk to vets here in town.
[02:08:13.794 --> 02:08:15.154]  Everybody's dogs are dying.
[02:08:15.374 --> 02:08:18.356]  They're going blind because of the plastic and garbage in the food.
[02:08:19.056 --> 02:08:19.996]  It's in human food.
[02:08:20.016 --> 02:08:23.258]  There's constant recalls of botulism in its back of the paper, you know.
[02:08:23.518 --> 02:08:25.199]  Hundreds of thousands of cans of chili.
[02:08:25.339 --> 02:08:28.180]  There's just stuff you can't eat and it's all falling apart!
[02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:30.821]  It's just all psychopathic!
[02:08:32.603 --> 02:08:34.544]  No one cares anymore in these corporations.
[02:08:34.604 --> 02:08:35.805]  No one cares about anything.
[02:08:35.845 --> 02:08:42.309]  It's all just a bunch of decadent slobs running around with a bunch of goons in black masks running around with torture devices.
[02:08:45.812 --> 02:08:47.193]  There's still so much good left.
[02:08:47.213 --> 02:08:49.494]  There's still people you're mesmerized by.
[02:08:49.514 --> 02:08:55.598]  The shining sun, the green trees, and the football, and Bevo, and your mascots, and everything.
[02:08:55.658 --> 02:08:58.620]  Everything's great and there's just evil all around us intensifying.
[02:09:03.334 --> 02:09:07.256]  And they got fakes like Dr. Dina Dell, Nationwide, who says, Mercury's good for you.
[02:09:07.316 --> 02:09:08.717]  By the way, the Mercury's out of the vaccines.
[02:09:08.777 --> 02:09:09.278]  No, it's not.
[02:09:10.158 --> 02:09:11.119]  Can prove that in 10 seconds.
[02:09:11.499 --> 02:09:12.720]  Cell phones aren't bad for you.
[02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:13.140]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:16.782]  It's just there to pacify everybody when it's in all these major university reports.
[02:09:17.322 --> 02:09:20.664]  I mean, I've gotten hundreds of reports I've read, scanned through.
[02:09:21.185 --> 02:09:25.787]  Going back to the 20s and 30s and the Rockefeller studying how to use fluoride to brain damage us.
[02:09:25.847 --> 02:09:28.549]  I mean, you just, you can't make this stuff up!
[02:09:31.610 --> 02:09:34.653]  And they put it in everything around us where we can't get away from it!
[02:09:35.294 --> 02:09:36.655]  No wonder people are dumb!
[02:09:36.695 --> 02:09:37.997]  It's not just the television.
[02:09:38.297 --> 02:09:40.059]  It's not just not interacting with people.
[02:09:40.099 --> 02:09:41.580]  They're poisoning us!
[02:09:44.003 --> 02:09:45.665]  And I'm not an enemy of the police.
[02:09:45.745 --> 02:09:49.669]  I wish you people stopped being dumb and realized just how criminal the system is!
[02:09:49.909 --> 02:09:51.270]  Do some real investigations!
[02:09:51.911 --> 02:09:52.552]  The feds!
[02:09:54.853 --> 02:10:08.781]  You're into the tough guy stuff, you're into your gang mentality, you're into you're doing the best, and the ADL tells you the New World Order doesn't exist, and the Federal Reserve isn't private, and all that bull you can just prove in five minutes, you can prove you're being lied to, but you just choose to accept it!
[02:10:09.421 --> 02:10:11.122]  You can't accept it anymore!
[02:10:15.005 --> 02:10:17.046]  Whether you like it or not, you're with us.
[02:10:17.666 --> 02:10:20.688]  Whether you deny it or not, you're an enemy of the New World Order.
[02:10:22.043 --> 02:10:23.384]  You're going to be used up!
[02:10:23.824 --> 02:10:25.005]  These people are sick!
[02:10:26.986 --> 02:10:27.707]  Look at this news!
[02:10:28.467 --> 02:10:30.348]  Written on board for U.S.
[02:10:30.388 --> 02:10:32.190]  strikes on Iran, London Telegraph.
[02:10:32.230 --> 02:10:39.134]  Brothers Defense Officials have held talks with their Pentagon counterparts about how they can help out if the U.S.
[02:10:39.174 --> 02:10:40.215]  chose to bomb Iran.
[02:10:41.172 --> 02:10:49.595]  Sources in Washington say that America has shelved plans for an all-out assault, going to destroy the Iranian nuclear facility and take out the Islamist regime.
[02:10:50.175 --> 02:11:03.140]  The Senate Telegraph has learned that President Bush's White House National Security Council, which is discussing instead, a plan to launch pinpoint attacks on bases operated by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Force, blamed for training Iraqi militias.
[02:11:03.180 --> 02:11:04.321]  That's totally made up.
[02:11:04.681 --> 02:11:05.341]  British and U.S.
[02:11:05.381 --> 02:11:06.462]  generals have said that's a lie.
[02:11:06.482 --> 02:11:08.182]  They keep calling that Shiite group
[02:11:11.542 --> 02:11:12.682]  They keep calling them Al Qaeda.
[02:11:12.702 --> 02:11:13.903]  That's the opposite group, folks.
[02:11:13.963 --> 02:11:14.983]  It's two separate sects.
[02:11:16.363 --> 02:11:25.066]  Pentagon officials have revealed that President Bush won an understanding with Gordon Brown in July that Britain would support airstrikes if they could be justified as a counter-terrorist operation.
[02:11:25.086 --> 02:11:28.366]  That's why they're designating their main military as terrorists.
[02:11:28.426 --> 02:11:30.647]  Now they get to bomb all the terror camps.
[02:11:33.048 --> 02:11:35.968]  And all that's going to make the world do is dump the dollar even faster.
[02:11:40.484 --> 02:11:42.645]  And the good old boys will be, but they're terrorists!
[02:11:42.685 --> 02:11:43.565]  Well, I'm an American!
[02:11:43.625 --> 02:11:44.726]  I love George Bush!
[02:11:44.746 --> 02:11:45.926]  The one getting rid of the borders.
[02:11:46.186 --> 02:11:48.447]  The one letting the illegal pull down the American flag.
[02:11:49.307 --> 02:11:51.688]  The one tripling the size of the BATF.
[02:11:51.728 --> 02:11:55.269]  The one more than doubling the size of the federal government.
[02:11:55.289 --> 02:11:59.471]  The one... I got three or four mainstream news articles yesterday and today.
[02:11:59.491 --> 02:12:00.651]  No, it's more than that.
[02:12:01.052 --> 02:12:02.052]  Five, six articles.
[02:12:02.612 --> 02:12:09.577]  Where they're getting Hillary ready and they're appointing all these former Clinton officials back in the White House and the Pentagon for the transfer to Hillary.
[02:12:09.858 --> 02:12:10.918]  It's staged!
[02:12:12.039 --> 02:12:15.602]  I just love my president because the bleeding hearts are against him.
[02:12:15.922 --> 02:12:19.065]  The bleeding hearts, it's all... Come on!
[02:12:19.365 --> 02:12:20.846]  Come on and grow up!
[02:12:24.349 --> 02:12:26.150]  Stop being played, man!
[02:12:26.210 --> 02:12:27.451]  Stop being saps!
[02:12:31.756 --> 02:12:35.979]  They knew what microwave radiation did to brains 50 years ago.
[02:12:39.261 --> 02:12:42.043]  They know what these cell phones and towers are doing.
[02:12:44.004 --> 02:12:45.325]  They knew all of it!
[02:12:45.345 --> 02:12:52.189]  I just... We're together on this!
[02:12:52.369 --> 02:12:54.591]  It really started hitting me last night.
[02:12:55.191 --> 02:12:57.533]  I have these epiphanies.
[02:12:57.553 --> 02:13:01.035]  I wouldn't call them revelations all the time, but it really hit me consciously.
[02:13:02.142 --> 02:13:02.983]  It really hit me.
[02:13:04.344 --> 02:13:07.607]  That's why COINTELPRO tries to get us to obsess on one group or the other.
[02:13:10.429 --> 02:13:16.054]  Is because then when other people hear it, they'll automatically factionalize, and then we can't get everybody together.
[02:13:16.434 --> 02:13:26.423]  Man, it doesn't matter if you are of German-Irish extraction, or Jewish-African extraction, or Chinese, Mandarin.
[02:13:26.943 --> 02:13:28.604]  We're all being microwaved.
[02:13:28.905 --> 02:13:30.286]  We're all being poisoned.
[02:13:31.067 --> 02:13:38.112]  And our leaders go, and they meet every year, and they set the policy for the next year, and they carry out their ops on us, and they write books about it.
[02:13:40.133 --> 02:13:41.074]  By the way, I keep forgetting.
[02:13:41.094 --> 02:13:42.195]  Will you go get Trey in here?
[02:13:42.215 --> 02:13:43.136]  Aaron.
[02:13:43.256 --> 02:13:45.617]  I have to yell at him because he's got headphones on.
[02:13:45.637 --> 02:13:46.558]  I don't yell at my employees.
[02:13:46.578 --> 02:13:48.279]  He's through glass and wearing headphones.
[02:13:48.299 --> 02:13:49.260]  I have to yell to get his attention.
[02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:50.120]  Aaron!
[02:13:50.681 --> 02:13:51.001]  Hey, bro.
[02:13:51.041 --> 02:13:51.501]  How you doing?
[02:13:51.902 --> 02:13:52.322]  Sorry to yell.
[02:13:52.682 --> 02:13:54.243]  Hey, will you go get Trey before I forget?
[02:13:54.263 --> 02:13:55.925]  I have to do this now or I'm going to forget.
[02:13:56.845 --> 02:13:57.646]  Will you go get Trey for me?
[02:13:57.726 --> 02:13:58.046]  Thanks.
[02:13:58.506 --> 02:13:58.767]  Show him.
[02:13:58.787 --> 02:13:59.367]  Come in on air.
[02:14:00.428 --> 02:14:00.728]  Thank you.
[02:14:05.955 --> 02:14:07.456]  The New World Order is there.
[02:14:08.597 --> 02:14:10.119]  There are Zionists running it.
[02:14:10.159 --> 02:14:11.520]  There are Catholics running it.
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:12.942]  There are Protestants running it.
[02:14:12.962 --> 02:14:16.025]  They're all evil people working together.
[02:14:16.726 --> 02:14:25.274]  And the Feds, in their own COINTELPRO manuals, declassified in the 70s, said they would go get people to nanny and obsess on groups and attack people.
[02:14:25.594 --> 02:14:29.118]  And he doesn't cover this enough to get us only spending our time on that.
[02:14:29.824 --> 02:14:38.732]  And all the years I've attacked cops at a primitive level being threatened by them, and the bullying things they do at a primitive level, screaming and yelling at them and getting mad.
[02:14:39.293 --> 02:14:43.257]  We need to rebuke them and speak out against them, but explain to them how they're being used as slaves.
[02:14:45.575 --> 02:14:55.341]  That fella with that Rockefeller authorized biography of the Rockefeller family, which I'd scanned through years ago, I forgot, never get quotes out of, he called in the last Friday and Sunday with them.
[02:14:55.781 --> 02:14:57.122]  You said he's written the article, right?
[02:14:57.482 --> 02:14:58.403]  Will you print me that?
[02:14:58.443 --> 02:15:00.124]  But has Watson posted it yet?
[02:15:00.144 --> 02:15:01.745]  I sent it to him, let me check.
[02:15:01.785 --> 02:15:03.146]  Yeah, I forgot to get that off the computer.
[02:15:03.166 --> 02:15:05.487]  It's an excellent article, but you say you sent it to him?
[02:15:05.507 --> 02:15:06.248]  Yeah, I want it up.
[02:15:06.868 --> 02:15:08.449]  I don't have the personnel, I don't have the money.
[02:15:09.950 --> 02:15:13.032]  And the time is so short to have enough people to do all this.
[02:15:13.072 --> 02:15:14.493]  My guys just work themselves to death.
[02:15:15.137 --> 02:15:18.398]  That's why you need to go to PrisonPlanet.com and order two copies in-game.
[02:15:18.478 --> 02:15:19.118]  Five copies!
[02:15:19.158 --> 02:15:19.858]  A hundred copies!
[02:15:19.898 --> 02:15:20.798]  That's how you support us.
[02:15:21.018 --> 02:15:23.139]  They ship out late this month.
[02:15:24.659 --> 02:15:26.759]  Okay, the official date's November 1st, but hmm.
[02:15:27.239 --> 02:15:27.780]  We'll get them out.
[02:15:30.020 --> 02:15:32.220]  Just please go to InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 and get it out.
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:32.580]  Thank you.
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:34.081]  Okay, this is a one, two, three page article.
[02:15:42.638 --> 02:15:46.680]  And he has written, Jay Dyer has written, I'm going to get him on as a guest in the next few days.
[02:15:48.181 --> 02:15:53.905]  Oh, yeah, tell Watson to make sure he doesn't post any of his personal emails and stuff, but to put his name on there.
[02:15:56.706 --> 02:15:59.208]  And let's give it some kind of an expanded headline.
[02:16:00.708 --> 02:16:01.689]  And he just goes through them.
[02:16:01.709 --> 02:16:03.210]  Man, I've read so many books.
[02:16:03.230 --> 02:16:10.454]  This is one I just scanned through where they just talk about how they rule over us, how we're slaves, how they're going to destroy the family.
[02:16:11.994 --> 02:16:14.675]  How they're going to do all... and this is a book they authorized.
[02:16:18.957 --> 02:16:20.618]  So that's one we're getting posted up there.
[02:16:20.818 --> 02:16:34.484]  I don't know, they've got an expanded article on what's happening with the Browns and how... basically, for all we know, Ed Brown could be in Poland having his fingers broken right now.
[02:16:37.964 --> 02:16:40.707]  I mean, the reason I'm so freaked out, folks, is it's all happening.
[02:16:40.948 --> 02:16:44.372]  The New World Order promised to destroy the dollar, promised to stage terror attacks.
[02:16:44.532 --> 02:16:47.235]  I mean, they said all this, and they're doing it all now.
[02:16:47.275 --> 02:16:50.879]  I mean, they do everything they say they do, and I just watch them year after year do what they say.
[02:16:54.343 --> 02:16:55.324]  And I know how to beat them.
[02:16:55.905 --> 02:16:57.667]  The question is, will the people out there listen to me?
[02:16:59.156 --> 02:17:04.677]  And I try to energize grassroots organizations and not control them and have them go off on their own and do big things.
[02:17:04.717 --> 02:17:09.519]  And I watch them getting hit by COINTELPRO and you know, kind of everybody infighting with each other.
[02:17:09.559 --> 02:17:12.919]  But I see some take the bait, others not take the bait.
[02:17:13.339 --> 02:17:18.081]  I'm just telling you, we've got to get more sophisticated and wake up to what's happening.
[02:17:22.482 --> 02:17:27.863]  And we need to realize that it's a dark road we're going down if we don't turn this around fast.
[02:17:28.996 --> 02:17:33.246]  Alright, we'll come back and get into the cop that killed all those people.
[02:17:34.228 --> 02:17:37.516]  We'll get into a whole bunch of other important news.
[02:17:37.536 --> 02:17:37.937]  Stay with me.
[02:17:46.903 --> 02:17:51.405]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:51.745 --> 02:17:55.827]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:56.127 --> 02:17:56.667]  We listened.
[02:17:56.987 --> 02:18:01.970]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:02.250 --> 02:18:02.710]  We listened.
[02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:06.133]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:06.573 --> 02:18:07.114]  We listened.
[02:18:07.574 --> 02:18:11.638]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:18:12.018 --> 02:18:12.499]  We listened.
[02:18:12.839 --> 02:18:18.084]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:18:18.505 --> 02:18:18.765]  Again,
[02:18:19.325 --> 02:18:19.846]  We listened.
[02:18:20.206 --> 02:18:21.787]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[02:18:21.987 --> 02:18:27.591]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:18:27.992 --> 02:18:30.654]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water purifier.
[02:18:30.834 --> 02:18:31.034]  Only $279.
[02:18:31.074 --> 02:18:31.574]  Call New Millennium.
[02:18:31.594 --> 02:18:31.694]  888-803-4438.
[02:18:31.734 --> 02:18:31.975]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:32.035 --> 02:18:33.336]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:18:33.356 --> 02:18:34.136]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:44.073 --> 02:18:50.278]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:18:50.739 --> 02:18:58.525]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:18:58.865 --> 02:19:06.712]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:19:07.032 --> 02:19:11.773]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:19:12.113 --> 02:19:16.835]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:19:17.335 --> 02:19:21.196]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:19:21.676 --> 02:19:22.697]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:19:22.777 --> 02:19:26.838]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:19:27.278 --> 02:19:31.659]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:19:32.179 --> 02:19:34.680]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:36.823]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:36.943 --> 02:19:37.163]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:43.727 --> 02:19:45.568]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:19:45.708 --> 02:19:50.890]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:19:51.070 --> 02:19:52.411]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:19:52.671 --> 02:20:00.874]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:20:01.074 --> 02:20:06.797]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:20:06.977 --> 02:20:08.739]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:20:08.819 --> 02:20:10.981]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:20:11.001 --> 02:20:15.365]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:20:15.525 --> 02:20:17.687]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:20:17.767 --> 02:20:25.515]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:20:25.555 --> 02:20:25.915]  We're good.
[02:20:43.235 --> 02:20:48.179]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:20:48.519 --> 02:20:50.380]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:20:50.580 --> 02:20:53.622]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:20:53.822 --> 02:20:56.944]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:20:57.245 --> 02:20:59.106]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:20:59.366 --> 02:21:03.067]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:21:03.348 --> 02:21:06.008]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:21:06.629 --> 02:21:10.930]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:21:11.130 --> 02:21:15.372]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:21:15.832 --> 02:21:20.154]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[02:21:20.454 --> 02:21:24.715]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:21:25.055 --> 02:21:30.917]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[02:21:31.217 --> 02:21:33.658]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:21:33.858 --> 02:21:34.378]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:21:34.398 --> 02:21:35.479]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[02:21:47.094 --> 02:21:49.638]  I think that a parasitic dream will never come back.
[02:21:49.718 --> 02:21:53.223]  It painted my hands and my face blue.
[02:21:53.363 --> 02:21:56.647]  And suddenly I saw the wind in my life.
[02:22:04.523 --> 02:22:13.546]  Y me hizo volar en el cielo infinito.
[02:22:13.566 --> 02:22:16.707]  Volare, oh, oh.
[02:22:16.787 --> 02:22:20.528]  Cantare, oh, oh.
[02:22:20.648 --> 02:22:23.769]  Negro, y pinto, y blue.
[02:22:23.849 --> 02:22:28.771]  Felice, cristal, y azul.
[02:22:28.891 --> 02:22:31.592]  Y volando, volando, feliz momento, eslamado.
[02:22:32.252 --> 02:22:38.315]  Man, I wish the New Old Order would let us live in peace with the Latin Americans, because I... I like the culture, I like the people.
[02:22:40.776 --> 02:22:41.937]  But we have to be enemies.
[02:22:42.057 --> 02:22:44.798]  That's what the New Old Order says.
[02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:49.380]  They know how to play us off against each other.
[02:22:49.941 --> 02:22:54.103]  So I guess we'll all just be peons, and our children will have slavery.
[02:22:54.743 --> 02:22:58.665]  But at least we can be proud, can't we, as idiots?
[02:23:10.047 --> 02:23:11.447]  Getting back into the news here.
[02:23:12.847 --> 02:23:19.629]  The families of the six slain and the one injured by this 20-year-old sheriff's deputy.
[02:23:21.069 --> 02:23:24.470]  He didn't like the girlfriend breaking up with him, so he just went to the party and killed everybody.
[02:23:26.354 --> 02:23:27.195]  Little get-together.
[02:23:27.235 --> 02:23:28.936]  He showed everybody who the commander was.
[02:23:28.996 --> 02:23:30.397]  People are like, I can't believe it!
[02:23:30.417 --> 02:23:31.878]  How did an officer do that?
[02:23:32.278 --> 02:23:36.401]  How did... How did he get hired?
[02:23:36.521 --> 02:23:37.562]  Well, there's evil people.
[02:23:37.622 --> 02:23:38.843]  You can't control evil.
[02:23:38.883 --> 02:23:40.063]  You're gonna have bad apples.
[02:23:41.665 --> 02:23:48.870]  And when a system protects bad apples, it actually looks for bad apples, like Stalin did, hiring the criminals out of the prisons.
[02:23:49.530 --> 02:23:51.812]  Our military looks for aggravated felons now.
[02:23:53.129 --> 02:23:55.851]  Who are illegal aliens on top of it, not just foreigners.
[02:23:55.871 --> 02:23:58.654]  I mean, you can't make this type stuff up!
[02:24:00.715 --> 02:24:05.699]  They're hiring criminals and those that have criminal test scores, psychological evaluations.
[02:24:05.759 --> 02:24:06.820]  Now, that's been in the news!
[02:24:07.181 --> 02:24:08.862]  They want crooks to be police!
[02:24:10.183 --> 02:24:12.345]  I remember when I was 18 years old and in college,
[02:24:13.323 --> 02:24:14.864]  And I was going, I could join the military.
[02:24:14.924 --> 02:24:16.424]  I could go into law enforcement.
[02:24:16.524 --> 02:24:17.484]  I want something exciting.
[02:24:18.045 --> 02:24:19.865]  And my dad said, hey, you've got to talk to my patient.
[02:24:19.905 --> 02:24:22.386]  He's the head federal marshal in this area.
[02:24:22.966 --> 02:24:24.126]  He's about to retire.
[02:24:25.547 --> 02:24:27.687]  And he goes, Alex, you're not a criminal, are you?
[02:24:27.707 --> 02:24:28.268]  And I said, no.
[02:24:28.628 --> 02:24:30.088]  Well, do you like to do criminal things?
[02:24:30.148 --> 02:24:31.249]  Because you can't tell the difference now.
[02:24:31.549 --> 02:24:34.990]  Cops are basically pretty much, at this level, criminals now.
[02:24:35.010 --> 02:24:36.030]  And he goes, I wouldn't join.
[02:24:36.090 --> 02:24:36.650]  I wouldn't do it.
[02:24:37.671 --> 02:24:38.691]  30, 40 years ago, maybe.
[02:24:38.711 --> 02:24:42.052]  I mean, I had a federal marshal
[02:24:43.408 --> 02:24:46.971]  Tell me that when I was 18 years old.
[02:24:50.434 --> 02:24:51.254]  18 years old, folks.
[02:24:51.294 --> 02:24:57.279]  That's how shot and gone and burned out this system is.
[02:25:00.121 --> 02:25:05.045]  That's why we have to have guns to protect ourselves because, see, this guy went and killed six people
[02:25:05.655 --> 02:25:07.456]  Well, what happens when they become president?
[02:25:07.736 --> 02:25:09.676]  What happens when people like that become governors?
[02:25:09.896 --> 02:25:11.677]  What happens when they become police chiefs?
[02:25:12.217 --> 02:25:16.278]  What happens when the people like that get into power and then recruit other people like that?
[02:25:17.258 --> 02:25:18.219]  You have tyranny.
[02:25:18.279 --> 02:25:19.059]  That's the norm.
[02:25:19.299 --> 02:25:23.260]  You create a big government, even if it was set up by good people, which they never are.
[02:25:24.561 --> 02:25:29.162]  But for the sake of argument, it is then taken over by bad people.
[02:25:30.896 --> 02:25:41.188]  And in many places we got cops just like this guy that like to frame people and shoot people and torture people and they get into power and they just do it and they keep on running for a long time.
[02:25:44.892 --> 02:25:48.796]  They're miserable unhappy scum but that keeps going on forever.
[02:25:50.619 --> 02:25:51.399]  Forrest County
[02:25:52.805 --> 02:26:02.127]  Sheriff's Deputy Tyler Peterson, who also worked part-time as a Crandon police officer, stormed into a home where a party was going on, opened fire, friends of the victims told CNN.
[02:26:02.547 --> 02:26:11.228]  School Superintendent Richard Peters told the Associated Press that three local high school students were killed and another three died and graduated within the past year.
[02:26:15.169 --> 02:26:15.949]  Unbelievable.
[02:26:16.909 --> 02:26:17.650]  You can look at it, man.
[02:26:17.690 --> 02:26:19.630]  He's got that look I've seen so many times.
[02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:24.303]  No real accomplishments, not a real man, but he got a badge, folks.
[02:26:24.363 --> 02:26:26.084]  And you get to be a big, fat bully.
[02:26:26.705 --> 02:26:29.127]  That very look of evil, you can just see it.
[02:26:29.547 --> 02:26:30.308]  It's the weakness.
[02:26:30.648 --> 02:26:31.469]  Evil is weak.
[02:26:33.070 --> 02:26:35.211]  You can see the pig-eyed look on this guy.
[02:26:35.652 --> 02:26:37.133]  And by the way, I call everybody pig people.
[02:26:37.173 --> 02:26:38.654]  That's not just calling cops pigs.
[02:26:39.255 --> 02:26:41.036]  I call it a pig demon look.
[02:26:41.757 --> 02:26:43.418]  That's just what comes to mind when I look at them.
[02:26:44.805 --> 02:26:50.767]  And, uh, you know, I guaranteed a spoiled brat of his parents, you know, driving around acting country-fied, acting tough.
[02:26:51.807 --> 02:26:53.447]  A good ol' boy on the inside.
[02:26:53.467 --> 02:26:56.728]  Yeah, let's get Junior in there on the fourth.
[02:26:57.008 --> 02:26:59.849]  Oh, we'll... And he just thought he'd go kill some people!
[02:27:01.630 --> 02:27:01.890]  See?
[02:27:03.970 --> 02:27:05.011]  And all you fools.
[02:27:05.431 --> 02:27:07.251]  Oh, let's have gun control.
[02:27:07.311 --> 02:27:09.992]  Let's, let's... Only the police should have guns.
[02:27:10.052 --> 02:27:12.593]  So, so, these guys can take over?
[02:27:12.613 --> 02:27:12.653]  No.
[02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:15.900]  No.
[02:27:17.601 --> 02:27:21.643]  We're going to check in on the Browns with Larry Becraft, constitutional law scholar, lawyer.
[02:27:21.663 --> 02:27:25.104]  I've got a bunch of other news here I'm going to pop in with as well.

[02:27:39.311 --> 02:27:42.052]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.305 --> 02:27:46.866]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.

[02:28:44.938 --> 02:28:47.319]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[02:28:47.839 --> 02:28:49.319]  After a pedicure, they look great.
[02:28:49.679 --> 02:28:53.480]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[02:28:53.940 --> 02:28:56.121]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[02:28:56.561 --> 02:28:59.902]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:29:00.302 --> 02:29:02.763]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:29:03.263 --> 02:29:04.303]  What's that name again?
[02:29:04.703 --> 02:29:05.883]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:29:06.264 --> 02:29:07.444]  It's CalX.
[02:29:07.844 --> 02:29:09.704]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[02:29:10.044 --> 02:29:11.865]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[02:29:12.668 --> 02:29:21.291]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:29:21.711 --> 02:29:27.434]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing CalX ointment.
[02:29:27.814 --> 02:29:38.938]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Phyllo, Card Drug, HEB grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:29:39.597 --> 02:29:40.717]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[02:29:41.038 --> 02:29:41.718]  I'll be right back.
[02:29:41.838 --> 02:29:43.579]  I'm getting some Calix for my heels.
[02:29:44.799 --> 02:29:50.281]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:50.721 --> 02:29:54.943]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:55.363 --> 02:30:02.226]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:02.666 --> 02:30:09.368]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:09.688 --> 02:30:11.309]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:30:11.609 --> 02:30:14.790]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:15.050 --> 02:30:17.510]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:30:17.830 --> 02:30:18.951]  BioSolutions has over 550
[02:30:20.031 --> 02:30:20.551]  We're good to go.
[02:30:56.903 --> 02:30:59.786]  You know what just happened?
[02:30:59.946 --> 02:31:00.326]  I, uh...
[02:31:25.093 --> 02:31:27.335]  For weeks, off and on, I kept calling.
[02:31:28.976 --> 02:31:33.659]  The police told me at the 1013 precinct in New York.
[02:31:35.261 --> 02:31:36.201]  You know what, Aaron?
[02:31:37.062 --> 02:31:39.524]  Aaron, because I'm going to get on a plane right after this if I don't have to.
[02:31:39.544 --> 02:31:42.566]  Will you go get me the 1013 precinct's phone number?
[02:31:43.907 --> 02:31:44.848]  Yeah, the 1013.
[02:31:45.408 --> 02:31:48.710]  I'm going to have to get on a plane and fly to New York tonight.
[02:31:49.731 --> 02:31:53.394]  Because it doesn't say this on the ticket, but we finally got a hold of people after weeks of calling.
[02:31:54.444 --> 02:32:17.402]  Chess Pit New World Order System that for a sound device even if your car stereo is up too loud and it's a misdemeanor you still have to physically appear in court and I'm trying to figure out in New York right now last minute if I can get a lawyer to go in there to appear for me but I'm told that New York is butt backwards as they say
[02:32:20.317 --> 02:32:23.720]  I mean, I'm just so sick of this criminal system, these parasites that run everything.
[02:32:23.780 --> 02:32:24.841]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[02:32:24.861 --> 02:32:28.203]  They just turned into a... I mean, look at this article right here.
[02:32:28.684 --> 02:32:31.306]  FBI puts anti-war protesters on criminal database.
[02:32:31.666 --> 02:32:34.909]  Op-Ed News reports on this, but it was in the major Canadian papers over the weekend.
[02:32:35.829 --> 02:32:38.972]  Canada uses its ban to ban protesters from entry.
[02:32:39.072 --> 02:32:40.113]  One of them, former U.S.
[02:32:40.353 --> 02:32:42.595]  ambassador, who we've interviewed.
[02:32:42.975 --> 02:32:43.936]  Two well-respected U.S.
[02:32:43.976 --> 02:32:46.518]  peace activists, Code Pink and Global Exchange co-founder,
[02:32:47.969 --> 02:32:52.133]  Our retired colonel and diplomat Anne Wright were denied entry into Canada.
[02:32:54.014 --> 02:33:05.063]  The two women were headed to Toronto to discuss peace and security issues at the invitation of the Toronto Stop the War Coalition at the Buffalo-Niagara Falls Bridge.
[02:33:05.764 --> 02:33:07.926]  They were detained, questioned, and denied entry.
[02:33:08.346 --> 02:33:16.413]  And it said for any misdemeanor, they are now criminal terrorists and cannot travel outside the U.S.
[02:33:17.003 --> 02:33:18.384]  So this is the new America, folks.
[02:33:18.404 --> 02:33:20.106]  We're about to go to Larry Veecraft.
[02:33:21.527 --> 02:33:23.248]  Oh, I just spilled coffee everywhere.
[02:33:23.288 --> 02:33:24.850]  I'm totally insane today, folks.
[02:33:29.814 --> 02:33:30.975]  Let's go ahead and go to Larry.
[02:33:33.550 --> 02:33:34.190]  Becraft.
[02:33:35.031 --> 02:33:38.873]  Man, I gave my lawyer this like two weeks ago and he finally realizes this.
[02:33:39.434 --> 02:33:41.395]  Let's go to Larry Becraft, another wonderful lawyer.
[02:33:41.875 --> 02:33:43.616]  Constitutional law scholar.
[02:33:43.656 --> 02:33:44.877]  Graduated top of his class.
[02:33:45.337 --> 02:33:46.338]  Won a lot of big cases.
[02:33:46.358 --> 02:33:52.802]  Just won one for another lawyer, Cryer, down in the South with income taxes.
[02:33:52.822 --> 02:33:59.046]  And I wanted to get him on to give us his take on what's happening with the Browns.
[02:33:59.106 --> 02:34:00.267]  Good to have you on, Mr. Becraft.
[02:34:00.927 --> 02:34:01.487]  Hello, Alex.
[02:34:01.847 --> 02:34:02.448]  How you doing today?
[02:34:03.129 --> 02:34:04.090]  Got a good program going.
[02:34:04.470 --> 02:34:08.194]  Oh, there's always insanity swirling around here, I tell ya.
[02:34:08.835 --> 02:34:12.078]  Have you heard the new one in Houston and in a suburb of Baltimore?
[02:34:12.098 --> 02:34:16.502]  They want people to be forced to put cameras in their houses and on their houses.
[02:34:17.423 --> 02:34:18.404]  Please stay, man.
[02:34:18.844 --> 02:34:19.925]  That's your theme, isn't it?
[02:34:19.945 --> 02:34:21.286]  You fight it all the time.
[02:34:22.868 --> 02:34:24.089]  These people are getting crazy.
[02:34:24.109 --> 02:34:26.691]  If we don't do something about it, you know, like if you smoke in your house.
[02:34:26.751 --> 02:34:28.233]  I heard some news story about
[02:34:29.174 --> 02:34:38.658]  And also in Maryland, that some lady several houses away could smell somebody smoking in their own house and she was opposed to it, wanted an ordinance to ban smoking in houses.
[02:34:39.118 --> 02:34:41.079]  It's only natural something like that come up.
[02:34:41.099 --> 02:34:51.663]  You know, George Orwell advocated in his book, you know, that there should be TV cameras inside your TV screen.
[02:34:52.664 --> 02:34:53.224]  What's new?
[02:34:55.265 --> 02:34:56.986]  Well, that's exactly what he did right about.
[02:35:00.012 --> 02:35:03.376]  You're also a criminal defense attorney.
[02:35:03.837 --> 02:35:05.359]  You've done that quite a bit successfully.
[02:35:05.379 --> 02:35:10.125]  I wanted to get your expertise on the Edna Lane Brown situation.
[02:35:10.185 --> 02:35:14.350]  She, of course, is in the Federal Bureau of Prisons now since Saturday.
[02:35:14.370 --> 02:35:17.073]  Ed Brown has disappeared into a black hole.
[02:35:17.794 --> 02:35:21.135]  And of course that violates, I guess, his habeas corpus and a bunch of other things.
[02:35:21.815 --> 02:35:28.996]  And I'm trying to get the media on this, but I remember seeing federal laws, regulations about they're supposed to have a chain of custody of where someone is.
[02:35:29.016 --> 02:35:30.877]  They're not supposed to have them disappear.
[02:35:32.677 --> 02:35:33.737]  What does this look like to you?
[02:35:35.038 --> 02:35:45.260]  Well, we can talk about the events that lead up to this, but to directly address your specific question, the mere fact that she's been taken into custody and people know where she is,
[02:35:45.885 --> 02:35:55.793]  You know, for him, he's considered a threat, so the system's going to sit there, and I've known people that have advantage for a while, and locating them is difficult.
[02:35:57.034 --> 02:35:59.977]  By the time you get around to complaining about it, it can be resolved, though.
[02:35:59.997 --> 02:36:02.439]  This is just one of the tricks that they pull.
[02:36:04.252 --> 02:36:07.114]  Do you think they're de-selling him like they did Congressman Hanson?
[02:36:07.675 --> 02:36:10.217]  No, I think that there's a great probability.
[02:36:10.297 --> 02:36:15.721]  I don't know what you've got in the way of federal correctional institutes or even federal prisons up there in New Hampshire.
[02:36:16.321 --> 02:36:22.226]  My guess is that they have probably, they certainly are going to put them together in the same county jail.
[02:36:23.247 --> 02:36:29.852]  Quite often, when federal defendants are arrested, they will put them in a county jail.
[02:36:29.932 --> 02:36:30.492]  You know, there's a
[02:36:32.202 --> 02:36:41.927]  Contractual agreements between the feds and local counties, where the local county jails will house federal inmates until quite often, up until trial.
[02:36:41.967 --> 02:36:49.751]  And then even after trial, before somebody gets convicted and they've got to go to the Federal Correctional Institute, they'll keep them housed in the county jails.
[02:36:50.172 --> 02:36:58.156]  So my guess is that Elaine is in some known, you're telling me that there's a known place where she's located right now.
[02:36:58.638 --> 02:36:59.478]  He's unknown.
[02:36:59.538 --> 02:37:04.820]  Chances are that they're running him around to several county jails, probably in New Hampshire.
[02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:10.041]  So the quote, the militia doesn't bust him out?
[02:37:11.081 --> 02:37:13.582]  I think that that's a legitimate fear that they have.
[02:37:13.642 --> 02:37:15.622]  They've expressed that they have that fear.
[02:37:16.182 --> 02:37:26.925]  So, you know, I can see one of the reasons why they would keep where he is locked up, you know, word of where he is until the thing's quietened down and they see that there's no longer a threat.
[02:37:27.515 --> 02:37:29.038]  They'll probably keep this up.
[02:37:29.578 --> 02:37:32.303]  Now I've seen him torture quite a few people in their custody.
[02:37:32.603 --> 02:37:41.538]  I think they're probably torturing him or at least sleep deprivation to quote find out you know who the people that were going to carry out revenge attacks are.
[02:37:43.114 --> 02:37:43.834]  I think possibility.
[02:37:43.874 --> 02:37:55.941]  Here in Alabama, here within the last two months, there was a criminal case over in another county right close to us where the crazy defendant, and he was crazy, he killed two cops.
[02:37:56.661 --> 02:38:02.744]  And as soon as he was sentenced, he was hauled off down to Montgomery, Alabama to the state prison.
[02:38:02.784 --> 02:38:05.406]  And with a couple days after his arrival there, he was dead.
[02:38:07.021 --> 02:38:08.402]  I've heard of the situations.
[02:38:08.423 --> 02:38:12.908]  I was involved in a case in Texas and the defendants were convicted.
[02:38:12.968 --> 02:38:20.236]  This was on issuing those drafts to pay off the IRS tax liens and pay off mortgages on banks and stuff like that.
[02:38:20.276 --> 02:38:23.600]  We tried this in front of Joe Kendall about 9 or 10 years ago.
[02:38:25.554 --> 02:38:30.898]  One of the defendants got out of jail and he was completely irritated with the whole system.
[02:38:32.079 --> 02:38:33.060]  He wouldn't report.
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:37.383]  One day they picked him up and hauled him into jail, and a couple days later he's dead.
[02:38:38.764 --> 02:38:42.747]  These stories about deaths in prison are there.
[02:38:43.347 --> 02:38:46.870]  What conclusions you draw from them, that's left up to
[02:38:48.047 --> 02:38:49.488]  Whatever you want to think.
[02:38:49.728 --> 02:38:54.991]  But there's a lady in the airport, she killed herself with her own handcuffs, Larry.
[02:38:55.191 --> 02:38:55.852]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:38:55.872 --> 02:39:04.177]  And Elaine Brown, getting back to them, this situation, it shouldn't have turned into a situation like this.
[02:39:05.916 --> 02:39:14.220]  When they were going to trial, there was a motion in limine that was entered, and I think that the Browns kind of overreacted to that.
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:22.625]  Typically, a motion in limine is bringing up some point that one party expects to happen at trial and getting that addressed in advance.
[02:39:23.225 --> 02:39:28.148]  Well, in the criminal tax case, a defendant is entitled to get on the stand and testify about his beliefs.
[02:39:28.568 --> 02:39:34.431]  And that means if he believes wages, not income, or whatever his belief might be, he's entitled to testify about them.
[02:39:35.228 --> 02:39:40.231]  The government comes along and files motions in limine, and a lot of people overreact to them.
[02:39:40.631 --> 02:39:46.054]  All they're simply saying there is, is that the defense is not going to be trying to tell the jury that this is the law.
[02:39:46.134 --> 02:39:49.416]  Well, you know, I frequently don't even reply to motions in limine.
[02:39:49.456 --> 02:39:50.257]  I just show up.
[02:39:50.717 --> 02:39:51.738]  Exactly!
[02:39:51.798 --> 02:39:53.579]  You ignore it and then say whatever you want.
[02:39:53.599 --> 02:39:55.140]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:40:01.103]  But I think that in the Browns case, they concluded that they weren't even going to be able to offer any testimony on that point.
[02:40:01.463 --> 02:40:02.524]  Of course they would have.
[02:40:03.404 --> 02:40:07.865]  Well, I have to say, and again, folks, we're allowed to talk about strategies.
[02:40:07.925 --> 02:40:09.165]  It doesn't have to be more people.
[02:40:09.745 --> 02:40:12.246]  Larry, you've seen every quack argument out there.
[02:40:12.266 --> 02:40:15.527]  You're actually able to get people found not guilty.
[02:40:16.207 --> 02:40:18.907]  You just did this in a federal income tax evasion case.
[02:40:19.767 --> 02:40:21.268]  You know what you're talking about.
[02:40:21.968 --> 02:40:23.988]  You don't get people sent to prison.
[02:40:25.109 --> 02:40:30.610]  And then I just see all these patriot quacks, and they call it technologies and all this fast talking.
[02:40:31.050 --> 02:40:32.050]  Man, I get sick of it.
[02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:33.701]  Me too, me too.
[02:40:34.281 --> 02:40:40.284]  In less than 48 hours I'll be down in Southern Georgia on arraignment on a case.
[02:40:40.344 --> 02:40:41.404]  It's going to be another one of these.
[02:40:43.045 --> 02:40:46.287]  This defendant was issuing liens against IRS agents.
[02:40:47.023 --> 02:40:48.924]  He issued the liens for 21 million.
[02:40:49.004 --> 02:40:49.764]  I got indicted.
[02:40:49.784 --> 02:40:51.464]  You know, I can remember when that was hot.
[02:40:51.524 --> 02:40:54.065]  Particularly in Texas, that type of advice was running around.
[02:40:54.145 --> 02:40:55.986]  Oh, you need to file liens against all these people.
[02:40:56.466 --> 02:41:00.467]  It's always been the case, you know, the government's going to, when you do something like that, you're going to get indicted.
[02:41:00.907 --> 02:41:06.409]  And I just see a lot of people out there listing to people that are basically selling indictments and getting them into trouble.
[02:41:06.769 --> 02:41:07.769]  And I wish it would stop.
[02:41:09.410 --> 02:41:13.651]  And it seems like the people giving the advice that ruins all these lives never get in trouble.
[02:41:15.433 --> 02:41:26.763]  Yeah, well I try to talk about it on my website and inform people that there are some dangerous propositions and dangerous positions to take and hope it's doing some service to stopping it.
[02:41:27.083 --> 02:41:29.085]  You mentioned just a moment ago this technology.
[02:41:29.125 --> 02:41:33.549]  I know the particular party that you're talking about there is kind of a UCC argument.
[02:41:34.133 --> 02:41:47.685]  You know, I envision later on down the road, having closely watched or looked at their particular arguments, they may not have any problems with it in the sense that the government won't respond to it.
[02:41:48.345 --> 02:41:53.890]  But, you know, there's a distinct possibility that the people that are advocating that could end up being prosecuted too.
[02:41:54.631 --> 02:41:57.093]  Well, I'm not even talking about a particular person.
[02:41:57.673 --> 02:41:59.675]  I just constantly hear that term bandied about.
[02:42:00.979 --> 02:42:08.761]  Well, of late, I've seen technology used in reference to a particular program, so it's kind of a UCC position.
[02:42:08.821 --> 02:42:12.522]  But, you know, here's a real problem.
[02:42:13.282 --> 02:42:18.163]  That UCC argument, like so many others, is pure fabrication.
[02:42:18.203 --> 02:42:20.403]  You know, it's just invented out of whole cloth.
[02:42:20.503 --> 02:42:22.064]  People will sit around and they'll listen to it.
[02:42:22.104 --> 02:42:23.584]  You've got somebody that's hyping it.
[02:42:23.604 --> 02:42:26.885]  Oh, look, we're doing this and we're doing that and they're selling some type of a program.
[02:42:27.751 --> 02:42:28.652]  People are gullible.
[02:42:28.692 --> 02:42:38.101]  They'll fall for that stuff, get involved in it, and I see over and over and over again it takes people that wouldn't be otherwise in trouble and throws them in jail.
[02:42:38.581 --> 02:42:39.622]  And that's got to stop.
[02:42:39.682 --> 02:42:43.586]  But then we're bad because we give people advice that won't get them in jail.
[02:42:43.926 --> 02:42:44.547]  Yeah, well...
[02:42:45.087 --> 02:42:53.810]  You know, you were talking about the New World Order and having to clean up our own case so that we can battle more effectively.
[02:42:53.890 --> 02:42:57.111]  I think that's exactly what the tax movement and the freedom movement has got to do.
[02:42:57.151 --> 02:43:03.553]  We've got to stop the nonsense because the nonsense only gives ammunition to the other side to throw at our side.
[02:43:03.873 --> 02:43:04.954]  It makes us look bad.
[02:43:05.034 --> 02:43:07.955]  We're held up to the rest of America as being looney toons.
[02:43:10.697 --> 02:43:15.102]  Until we present a more acceptable face to the American people, our ranks won't grow.
[02:43:15.622 --> 02:43:19.386]  And I'm trying to make our ranks grow, just like you are.
[02:43:20.207 --> 02:43:21.569]  You're waking up a lot of people.
[02:43:22.202 --> 02:43:24.623]  You're telling the story that needs to be told.
[02:43:24.903 --> 02:43:28.705]  Well, we need to carry out the same type of strategy on our side.
[02:43:29.105 --> 02:43:34.768]  We need to clean up and quit promoting flaky arguments, arguments that get people into jail.
[02:43:35.188 --> 02:43:38.810]  I've got a case out in California right now, a state case.
[02:43:39.670 --> 02:43:44.132]  This guy quit filing sales tax returns, and there was no strategy in doing that.
[02:43:44.172 --> 02:43:45.433]  No defense lined up.
[02:43:45.473 --> 02:43:46.253]  They just quit.
[02:43:46.613 --> 02:43:48.174]  So it results in 20 counts for that.
[02:43:50.055 --> 02:43:50.696]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:44:08.562 --> 02:44:13.544]  And then poor patriots call up here on this show and they go, listen, I got a Nigerian prince calling me, Alex.
[02:44:13.824 --> 02:44:15.245]  And I'll say, and let me guess, it's $5,000.
[02:44:15.965 --> 02:44:16.565]  No, it's $6,000.
[02:44:16.885 --> 02:44:18.886]  And I go, listen, it's a scam.
[02:44:18.926 --> 02:44:19.807]  And they go, no it isn't.
[02:44:19.827 --> 02:44:22.268]  Now listen to me, I've talked to him on the phone.
[02:44:22.308 --> 02:44:23.508]  All he needs is more money.
[02:44:23.788 --> 02:44:26.129]  The feds are holding the $14 million check up.
[02:44:26.489 --> 02:44:27.990]  They will not listen to me.
[02:44:28.290 --> 02:44:30.251]  They just don't want to listen.
[02:44:31.011 --> 02:44:33.993]  And it's the same thing with all these COINTELPRO folks out there.
[02:44:34.013 --> 02:44:39.696]  I mean, a lot of people are starting to listen, but the particular ones that have bought into a con aren't going to listen.
[02:44:39.716 --> 02:44:43.038]  I mean, I remember telling Ed privately, and I'm not saying Ed's bad, folks.
[02:44:43.058 --> 02:44:46.941]  I'm not saying that the IRS isn't a scam and offshore and all this stuff.
[02:44:47.401 --> 02:44:54.885]  I remember privately going, Ed, you might not want to tell folks that you're shooting into the woods when people walk around in them, because that's an improper use of a firearm.
[02:44:54.925 --> 02:44:55.986]  It's public endangerment.
[02:44:56.586 --> 02:44:58.127]  Kids could be walking around in your woods.
[02:44:58.147 --> 02:44:59.188]  There's neighborhoods nearby.
[02:45:00.347 --> 02:45:03.570]  Well, that's just what I do, and I'm a constitutional ranger, and I blah, blah, blah.
[02:45:03.970 --> 02:45:08.374]  And then parties up there, guaranteeing that that'll just accelerate the feds coming in.
[02:45:08.394 --> 02:45:10.356]  And no one listened to me!
[02:45:10.416 --> 02:45:16.761]  Larry, it's like, it's all these people in this movement that act like I've just fallen off, or you've just fallen off a turnip truck.
[02:45:17.122 --> 02:45:19.524]  Well, listen, let's talk about Ed and Elaine Brown's case.
[02:45:20.656 --> 02:45:31.501]  If they hadn't have been buffaloed by that trial, by that motion in limine, if they'd have known that that doesn't prevent them from offering their beliefs, they could have at least stood there and gone to trial.
[02:45:31.881 --> 02:45:39.424]  But then merely walking off and not appearing in court, that's saying the next charges that are going to come are going to be for failure to appear.
[02:45:39.464 --> 02:45:42.245]  That's going to be a felony because this was a felony.
[02:45:42.665 --> 02:45:43.986]  So the Browns are looking at
[02:45:44.966 --> 02:45:45.447]  I don't think so.
[02:46:02.242 --> 02:46:02.522]  I think so.
[02:46:19.517 --> 02:46:29.426]  And then, you know, holding up and, you know, exposing themselves to assure, it's 100% certain that a failure to appear is going to be prosecuted against them.
[02:46:30.186 --> 02:46:33.149]  And there's probably going to be some other charges brought against them.
[02:46:33.589 --> 02:46:40.195]  This whole situation, you know, because of what people didn't know about how to try a case,
[02:46:40.835 --> 02:46:42.979]  It has been blown out of proportion.
[02:46:53.346 --> 02:46:56.948]  Uh, representations about this case, and it certainly hadn't helped our morals.
[02:46:57.128 --> 02:47:07.712]  Overshadowing, uh, nine people being found in 161 counts not guilty or mistrial, uh, in Nevada, and you winning a case and all these other cases being won.
[02:47:08.552 --> 02:47:12.134]  Meanwhile, it's all just, you don't pay, you end up going to jail like the Browns.
[02:47:12.194 --> 02:47:22.778]  And again, they're dear, sweet people who knew it was criminal, knew the system was corrupt, so they thought that they could then basically take on a Sherman tank when they're on the back of a bicycle.
[02:47:23.879 --> 02:47:28.765]  Well, I use the analogy, we've got a bunch of little old ladies out there with brooms battling tanks.
[02:47:29.706 --> 02:47:31.408]  And that's exactly our posture.
[02:47:31.428 --> 02:47:37.355]  Unless this movement comes... You know, Alex, there's such a thing as critical path planning.
[02:47:38.112 --> 02:47:48.675]  And when a contractor builds a house, he has a plan, and he pulls together all the resources to build the house, and it comes together, and he does it in the shortest time possible and does the best job possible.
[02:47:48.995 --> 02:47:50.395]  That's called critical path planning.
[02:47:50.696 --> 02:47:56.097]  When a nation engages in war, just like we did with Iraq, there's planning in advance.
[02:47:56.117 --> 02:47:57.597]  That's called a critical path.
[02:47:58.118 --> 02:48:02.779]  This movement will not come together and devise a critical path.
[02:48:02.839 --> 02:48:05.140]  First, we've got to establish what our goal is.
[02:48:05.300 --> 02:48:06.560]  What goal do we want to achieve?
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:07.560]  Larry, stay there.
[02:48:07.580 --> 02:48:08.181]  One final segment.
[02:48:08.241 --> 02:48:10.702]  I've only got one question for you on the other side.
[02:48:28.412 --> 02:48:31.496]  If they weren't there for the trial, can't we get another trial?
[02:48:31.556 --> 02:48:32.858]  Isn't there procedural problems?
[02:48:33.198 --> 02:48:37.583]  Shouldn't the trial have been halted until they can get them back in court?
[02:48:37.944 --> 02:48:38.524]  How does that work?
[02:48:48.431 --> 02:48:51.615]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:51.955 --> 02:48:53.877]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.258 --> 02:49:01.886]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.580 --> 02:49:09.643]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.023 --> 02:49:21.428]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.768 --> 02:49:25.410]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.730 --> 02:49:27.971]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.011 --> 02:49:31.833]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:46.724 --> 02:49:47.785]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:49:48.105 --> 02:49:50.887]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:51.147 --> 02:49:55.310]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:55.731 --> 02:49:56.571]  So what do you do?
[02:49:56.871 --> 02:50:01.455]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:50:01.915 --> 02:50:04.056]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:50:04.536 --> 02:50:05.416]  Sheltering in Place!
[02:50:05.836 --> 02:50:19.239]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:50:45.023 --> 02:50:49.306]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:50:49.566 --> 02:50:54.470]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:50:54.670 --> 02:50:55.991]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:56.171 --> 02:50:59.513]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:52:01.485 --> 02:52:05.208]  I won't even turn my head.
[02:52:07.768 --> 02:52:11.949]  Don't send your Kim folks to give me no talking.
[02:52:12.049 --> 02:52:15.610]  I'll be gone, like I said.
[02:52:15.650 --> 02:52:24.473]  All right, we just got a few minutes left with Larry Becraft here in just a moment, and I'll ask him that final question, and then, of course, we'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central.

[02:52:39.862 --> 02:52:40.943]  South Manhattan.
[02:52:41.543 --> 02:52:43.044]  Man, I may have to get on a plane to go there.
[02:52:43.064 --> 02:52:44.384]  They told me I could have a lawyer there.
[02:52:44.444 --> 02:52:45.465]  Now they're saying I have to be there.
[02:52:45.485 --> 02:52:47.165]  I'm so sick of this country.
[02:52:47.185 --> 02:52:48.686]  It's such a dirtbag nation.
[02:52:49.967 --> 02:52:50.927]  I just can't believe it.
[02:52:51.367 --> 02:52:52.768]  A couple of great sponsors, folks.
[02:52:52.868 --> 02:52:53.609]  eFoods Direct.
[02:52:53.629 --> 02:52:55.469]  The New World Order could implode us with depression.
[02:52:55.529 --> 02:52:55.930]  Anything.
[02:52:56.410 --> 02:52:58.711]  If you've got food, they can't force you to come to the FEMA camp.
[02:52:59.412 --> 02:53:00.694]  Regardless, we have a depression.
[02:53:00.734 --> 02:53:02.035]  It's good to have backup food.
[02:53:02.135 --> 02:53:05.399]  eFoodsDirect is the best company out there.
[02:53:05.660 --> 02:53:06.641]  26 years in operation.
[02:53:06.701 --> 02:53:07.822]  eFoodsDirect's the website.
[02:53:07.842 --> 02:53:09.064]  It's the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[02:53:09.524 --> 02:53:10.706]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:53:10.766 --> 02:53:16.273]  Giant banners on the top of PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[02:53:18.346 --> 02:53:20.048]  And just go there and get a two-month supply.
[02:53:20.068 --> 02:53:21.809]  Here's a supply I bought from them twice.
[02:53:21.829 --> 02:53:25.712]  You're completely insane if you don't call them.
[02:53:25.732 --> 02:53:26.273]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:53:26.293 --> 02:53:30.416]  1-800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.

[02:53:32.758 --> 02:53:35.700]  The best green food I've seen out there, bar none, is Interfood.

[02:54:16.856 --> 02:54:17.036]  1-866-762-9238.
[02:54:17.276 --> 02:54:20.797]  Just one scoop a day.
[02:54:21.257 --> 02:54:22.178]  Interfood.com.
[02:54:22.478 --> 02:54:25.698]  Alright, Larry Becraft, I appreciate you holding here to the end of the show.
[02:54:25.718 --> 02:54:33.260]  It seems like every time you're on, I've got SWAT teams running around out in the front, or I'm learning how to fly to New York for using a bullhorn.
[02:54:34.941 --> 02:54:39.762]  All of this craziness going on, but the dollar plunging, all this wild stuff happening.
[02:54:41.667 --> 02:54:43.648]  Could they get a retrial on the first thing?
[02:54:43.768 --> 02:54:47.391]  Or is that kosher that they walked out and just go ahead and have the trial?
[02:54:48.091 --> 02:54:49.993]  Well, that has happened.
[02:54:51.574 --> 02:54:55.056]  They were listening to Michael Avery at Outlaw Legal Services.
[02:54:55.076 --> 02:55:00.440]  He's the guy that promotes George Mercy's book on contracts, which is all myth and science fiction.
[02:55:01.020 --> 02:55:03.482]  But nonetheless, a giant mess was created.
[02:55:03.502 --> 02:55:08.405]  And then after the conviction happened, there was a chance for them to file post-trial motions.
[02:55:08.465 --> 02:55:09.846]  Well, the 10 days ran on that.
[02:55:10.905 --> 02:55:18.027]  Then they got sentenced, and there's been no post-trial motions or any other attacks on it since this trial came about.
[02:55:18.087 --> 02:55:29.549]  The only thing that I see that they've got left, and this is going to take some work in order to review the record and everything else, the only thing I see that can help them is a 2255, which is a habeas corpus.
[02:55:30.450 --> 02:55:33.230]  Otherwise, there's going to be a lot of missed opportunities.
[02:55:34.171 --> 02:55:35.611]  Instead, they'll probably try to
[02:55:36.497 --> 02:55:37.138]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:55:37.178 --> 02:55:37.838]  I'm afraid so.
[02:55:37.978 --> 02:55:38.679]  Give me a call, Alex.
[02:55:38.739 --> 02:55:39.599]  I always enjoy your programs.
[02:56:07.525 --> 02:56:12.308]  And let's just try to fight the New World Order as best we can and not escalate this into a shooting war.
[02:56:13.649 --> 02:56:15.750]  But prayer does help, and let's all pray for Ed.
[02:56:15.791 --> 02:56:16.911]  He's got a lot of courage.
[02:56:17.712 --> 02:56:19.593]  And he's got guts, and guts is enough.
[02:56:20.634 --> 02:56:21.454]  God bless you all.
