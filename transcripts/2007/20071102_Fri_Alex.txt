[00:00:05.353 --> 00:00:06.014]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.654 --> 00:00:07.755]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.416 --> 00:00:09.537]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.197 --> 00:00:10.998]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.758 --> 00:00:13.680]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.983]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.523 --> 00:00:21.586]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:34.716]  Yeah, I think.
[00:00:38.513 --> 00:00:40.214]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:41.875]  It's already November 2nd, 2007.
[00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:51.401]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours and we're also going to have wide open phones today for the full three hours at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:51.421 --> 00:01:02.348]  The White House is openly continuing to discuss open strikes on Iran, quote, preemptive aggressive criminal war.
[00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:11.497]  We have the stock market plunging more than 370 points, the Dow Jones Industrial, and plunging even more in early trading today.
[00:01:12.058 --> 00:01:19.886]  Worldwide markets are universally down, and the dollar continues to slide, the crises deepening.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.681]  We're good to go.
[00:01:37.783 --> 00:01:39.164]  But it doesn't matter if the U.N.
[00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:41.345]  is kidnapping hundreds of thousands of children a year.
[00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:42.606]  That's not important news.
[00:01:42.946 --> 00:01:51.931]  We're going to obsess and get upset about one piece of filth inside Oprah Winfrey's system and talk about how she's evil and bad now.
[00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:54.612]  And we're going to talk about Dog and O.J.
[00:01:54.672 --> 00:01:56.133]  and things that don't matter.
[00:01:56.173 --> 00:01:59.395]  Well, not on this show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:59.875 --> 00:02:04.518]  We're not even going to talk about Republican congressmen and their boyfriends dressed up like women.
[00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:09.510]  Frankly, none of that, compared to what's happening, even matters, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:12.652 --> 00:02:15.993]  Stock prices plunged yesterday, more than 370 points.
[00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:17.914]  It continued its drop today.
[00:02:17.974 --> 00:02:21.415]  We'll give you all the latest numbers after this first break.
[00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:24.125]  Meanwhile, unwelcoming U.S.
[00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:28.287]  see sharp fall in visitors since 9-11 because the U.S.
[00:02:28.307 --> 00:02:31.329]  has some of the worst police state measures of any country in the world.
[00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.429]  That's right.
[00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.771]  China is easier to get into and out of than the U.S.
[00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:38.352]  if you are actually a law-abiding citizen.
[00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:43.955]  If you are a legal alien in this country, you have no problem.
[00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:44.795]  Literally.
[00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:49.498]  You can go up on North 183 in Austin and watch the police all day.
[00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.159]  We're good to go.
[00:03:18.655 --> 00:03:22.418]  We are entering the complete absolute total twilight zone system.
[00:03:23.397 --> 00:03:28.060]  Also, Britain's colossal food waste is stoking climate change.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.163]  They tell Britons to start cutting back on how much they eat to save the Earth.
[00:03:32.223 --> 00:03:42.069]  Again, this is all about massive social control, creating hordes of bureaucrats to not just look for you saying racist things under your breath in restaurants, but not finishing your meals or wasting them.
[00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.411]  Again, total social worker hell, transhumanist control.
[00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:48.293]  This was all formed by the eugenicist.
[00:03:48.693 --> 00:03:52.075]  If you want to be micromanaged and have a nanny state on steroids,
[00:03:52.495 --> 00:03:54.217]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're going to be entering it.
[00:03:54.257 --> 00:03:57.220]  We'll get into that as well today.
[00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:02.085]  Memo approves Rumsfeld-directed psychological terror campaign.
[00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:03.686]  These memos are amazing.
[00:04:04.147 --> 00:04:09.112]  And they are public where he said, stoke fear, claim there are terrorists everywhere, say the U.S.
[00:04:09.172 --> 00:04:11.174]  is surrounded, lie to the people.
[00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:15.298]  We have Republican memos where they said they want terror attacks to happen.
[00:04:16.074 --> 00:04:23.496]  Where they want to create fear, where they've admitted that the color-coding system is bumped up every time they have a scandal.
[00:04:24.076 --> 00:04:27.157]  This, by its very definition, is terrorism.
[00:04:27.577 --> 00:04:29.957]  So we'll be going over that today.
[00:04:29.977 --> 00:04:32.998]  Global warming bill, it advances in the Senate.
[00:04:33.338 --> 00:04:35.259]  That ties in with this article out of Britain.
[00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.200]  Also, this Law of the Sea Treaty, no one thought it would a few days ago, but it has passed.
[00:04:40.956 --> 00:04:41.436]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:42.096]  A new world order.
[00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:43.897]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by power.
[00:05:10.859 --> 00:05:13.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg Effect.
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.921]  Isn't their objective being world domination?
[00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.902]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.642 --> 00:05:27.005]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:29.986 --> 00:05:34.968]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.730]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.812]  Bill Burgess makes great progress in the world, doesn't he?
[00:05:41.852 --> 00:05:42.832]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:42.852 --> 00:05:43.773]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.793 --> 00:05:44.874]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.094 --> 00:05:45.854]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.074 --> 00:05:46.935]  That's what they're after, you see.

[00:08:00.725 --> 00:08:05.787]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.148 --> 00:08:08.428]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:30.116]  Consumer spending on even stable items like eggs and milk is dropping.
[00:08:31.236 --> 00:08:35.158]  The average American is at the deepest point of debt in U.S.
[00:08:35.398 --> 00:08:35.958]  history.
[00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:45.022]  The dollar plunged about half a cent again yesterday and continues its free fall.
[00:08:45.896 --> 00:08:49.718]  The Dow dropped more than 370 points.
[00:08:50.078 --> 00:08:51.759]  That's the Dow Jones Industrial 30.
[00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:55.020]  Only the top 30 winning stocks.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.642]  Thousands of other lesser stocks are not included in that index.
[00:08:59.862 --> 00:09:00.602]  Remember that.
[00:09:01.163 --> 00:09:05.825]  The top 30 winning, highest performing stocks dropped.
[00:09:07.725 --> 00:09:10.126]  The Dow has dropped another 59.18 points.
[00:09:14.749 --> 00:09:23.371]  Just since trading opened this morning and is continuing its downward trend as we speak.
[00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:44.817]  Despite the fact that large central banks pumped in 41 billion dollars into the Dow alone yesterday and are continuing to infuse cash into other areas of the markets trying to shore up the loans, the different housing loans and different corporate paper that has been sold.
[00:09:46.434 --> 00:09:52.818]  Over $400 billion in the last three months has been injected by central banks worldwide.
[00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:54.239]  In fact, that number is a few weeks old.
[00:09:54.259 --> 00:09:56.780]  It's got to be over $500 billion now.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.061]  I mean, just yesterday in the U.S.
[00:09:58.161 --> 00:09:58.761]  it was $41 billion.
[00:09:59.081 --> 00:10:05.485]  Worldwide, central banks are pumping money in, but only to control the slide, to have it be more gradual.
[00:10:06.969 --> 00:10:09.089]  Now, we saw something really bad happen yesterday.
[00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:30.574]  They cut the interest rates by 25 basis points, and that was supposed to boost the stock market, signaling that they were willing to drive the dollar down lower, but it didn't, because the Fed said that's the last interest rate cut for the next couple quarters, and so that caused the market to go down, while the dollar went down simultaneously.
[00:10:31.474 --> 00:10:34.095]  To explain this in layman's terms, people who don't understand it,
[00:10:35.848 --> 00:10:41.919]  Federal Securities, which again are private District of Columbia Banking Securities that pose as U.S.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.306]  government assets that are being sold on the global market.
[00:10:47.054 --> 00:10:57.603]  England, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Germany, hundreds of other countries are paying higher interest rates on their government securities, on bonds and other securities.
[00:10:58.083 --> 00:11:06.190]  And so why if somebody can get 7, 8% in another country, would they want to get 5, 5.5% or lower from U.S.
[00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:11.914]  securities here, when it's a devalued, grossly devalued currency to begin with?
[00:11:12.375 --> 00:11:13.776]  And there's not a lot of faith in it now.
[00:11:15.282 --> 00:11:19.463]  So by further cutting it, that only caused more people to dump U.S.
[00:11:19.503 --> 00:11:22.004]  securities or to move away from them.
[00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:25.225]  This gets very complex.
[00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:26.765]  It's sure to drag down Europe.
[00:11:26.805 --> 00:11:34.447]  They're already seeing massive slumps, and I'm looking at the numbers from CNBC right here, in their last quarter of factory productions.
[00:11:35.168 --> 00:11:39.749]  And again, consumer spending here, not just on bauble items or
[00:11:41.952 --> 00:11:50.602]  Durable goods but actually on staples food things like Cheerios milk peanut butter produce
[00:11:51.414 --> 00:12:00.621]  And of course, they're buying less because the prices are exploding at over 13% this year alone, compounded on the 10% the year before that.
[00:12:01.101 --> 00:12:04.183]  And these are what the big brokerage houses and other financial firms are putting out.
[00:12:04.484 --> 00:12:08.467]  Between 13.6% on the low end and 18%, they all debate it.
[00:12:08.827 --> 00:12:09.848]  The Feds claim we've got 3.9%.
[00:12:09.888 --> 00:12:18.034]  And part of their bogus numbers they put out, yeah, right, we've got 3.9% yearly inflation.
[00:12:18.274 --> 00:12:19.635]  That is just such a fraud.
[00:12:20.385 --> 00:12:24.649]  Cars that were $30,000 last year are $45,000 this year.
[00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.274]  I mean, cars they haven't even sold since last year are sitting there where the stickers are.
[00:12:29.594 --> 00:12:32.537]  They've upped them.
[00:12:32.657 --> 00:12:36.140]  Milk that was $1 is $4.
[00:12:37.021 --> 00:12:42.667]  Everything but housing is exploding, and that's what's bad about this, is that we have
[00:12:45.325 --> 00:12:51.266]  Really stagflation coming in here, and that's why they destroyed one of the few real cash sinks we had.
[00:12:52.106 --> 00:12:59.648]  Sure, a $400,000 house five years ago is going for a million now, and that's overvalued.
[00:13:00.188 --> 00:13:07.090]  But at least there's something real and tangible there in that house versus the dollar, versus federal securities.
[00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.811]  And it's not just the subprime mortgages and the jumbo loans that are in trouble.
[00:13:15.567 --> 00:13:17.208]  It is the derivatives.
[00:13:17.528 --> 00:13:22.071]  It is every major sector of the economy.
[00:13:22.191 --> 00:13:23.872]  It is the hedge funds.
[00:13:24.932 --> 00:13:28.854]  It is... and all of those are in deep trouble.
[00:13:30.135 --> 00:13:34.618]  And what we're seeing right now is only the leading edge of this storm.
[00:13:35.818 --> 00:13:38.480]  Right now the storm is just beginning to touch us.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:50.322]  I mean, really, the little bit of assets I've got to secure the InfoWars operation against the New World Order, I really should just take off the next week and just try to scramble with the limited assets we've got.
[00:13:50.362 --> 00:14:03.584]  I've been too busy to even try to properly position those to meet payroll and to deal with things in the future and to deal with manufacturing and be able to make the DVDs and be able to buy the books from people and DVDs that they produce.
[00:14:03.604 --> 00:14:07.465]  You have to buy those in bulk to get a good price and you're sitting on them for a year.
[00:14:08.443 --> 00:14:09.244]  I don't think so.
[00:14:30.017 --> 00:14:33.961]  Uh, you would think if you doubled or tripled an audience, sales of books and videos would double or triple.
[00:14:34.021 --> 00:14:34.221]  No!
[00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:43.269]  Because the economy has been in deep contraction for several years, but the public has been so brainwashed, they've still been buying the Kool-Aid that everything's fine.
[00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:46.071]  When your neighbors lost their job, it's a recession.
[00:14:46.091 --> 00:14:50.795]  When you lose your job, it's a depression, the old cliche goes, and it certainly rings true.
[00:14:51.761 --> 00:15:07.072]  Gold is right up, been hovering now for three days, right at $800 an ounce, but gold mining futures and other stocks are associated with gold and gold paper are at about $802, some of them even higher.
[00:15:07.092 --> 00:15:09.094]  So, gold is at $795.80 right now, up $619 on the day.
[00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:41.072]  And when mainstream analysts come out and say that gold has only adjusted for inflation, and this is now mainstream news, that they're looking at $1,500 conservatively, if it adjusts to the dollar devaluation, as high as $2,800.
[00:15:41.112 --> 00:15:48.217]  Now, I don't know if that's going to happen, but I know that gold was $325 six years ago, and I know now it has moved big time.
[00:15:52.475 --> 00:15:57.938]  So we're in very serious times, and that's why every couple days I've been getting Ted Anderson up.
[00:15:58.179 --> 00:16:04.002]  Ted, we just got a few minutes here, and I know you've got an offer for listeners that, again, they would be very foolish.
[00:16:04.162 --> 00:16:14.709]  I mean, I've been calling family up saying, you better dump stock for weeks, for months, for years, but now they're finally listening, and they're trying to move into metals, and I'm trying to explain to them, you don't want to hold paper.
[00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.891]  I mean, if things go to pieces, which they've done many times in world history and U.S.
[00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:20.912]  history, you're not going to be able to get that.
[00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:24.433]  You want to have physical holdings in this.
[00:16:25.153 --> 00:16:29.194]  Ted, I mean, I woke up again last night.
[00:16:29.814 --> 00:16:31.054]  This is freaking me out.
[00:16:31.494 --> 00:16:32.395]  I'm really upset.
[00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:38.801]  Because if this is just the beginning, can you imagine what it's going to be like next year, sir?
[00:16:39.221 --> 00:16:45.384]  Oh, you know, you're talking about the paper, and in my experience, I had a Series 7 license.
[00:16:45.484 --> 00:16:48.305]  I had the ability to sell stocks in 1987 when the market crashed.
[00:16:50.206 --> 00:17:01.915]  And there was so many margin calls that came in, even though gold spot prices are going up, the mining stocks lost 47% of their value just immediately like that, just on margin calls.
[00:17:02.256 --> 00:17:07.160]  That's the reason why the United States real estate market is hurting right now, because it's leveraged so heavily.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.204]  People buy houses with mortgages, and right now they can't afford to go further into debt.
[00:17:12.244 --> 00:17:13.805]  They're already in debt as far as they can go.
[00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:15.566]  We've hit the wall.
[00:17:15.606 --> 00:17:16.787]  It's like a marathon runner.
[00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:17.448]  We've hit the wall.
[00:17:17.648 --> 00:17:19.329]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:17:19.469 --> 00:17:24.052]  As a matter of fact, the other day when you said, the economists, when do you think this thing is going to come unglued?
[00:17:24.072 --> 00:17:25.733]  Well, it's already unglued.
[00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:27.634]  We've already passed that point.
[00:17:27.674 --> 00:17:30.035]  The United States dollar is falling again today.
[00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:32.957]  Every time I come on air, the dollar is going down.
[00:17:33.017 --> 00:17:36.439]  We're losing purchasing power almost as fast as Argentina.
[00:17:36.459 --> 00:17:37.580]  And this is what scares me.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.042]  I've been trying to convince people to position and protect themselves.
[00:17:41.422 --> 00:17:44.444]  Most of them didn't listen, even in my circle of friends and others.
[00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:58.652]  Because they didn't want to believe that their investments in Edward Jones or in Schwab or in JPMorgan or Chase, any of these, they just didn't want to believe that the stock market wasn't really at $14,000.
[00:17:59.372 --> 00:18:02.414]  Now we've got the dollar dropping with the stock market dropping.
[00:18:03.314 --> 00:18:04.895]  Do you think this is the beginning of the vortex?
[00:18:05.075 --> 00:18:08.515]  Oh, Alex, as far as I'm concerned, we've crossed the vortex.
[00:18:08.576 --> 00:18:13.317]  I realize that it has to snowball and things are definitely going to get a lot tougher and a lot worse.
[00:18:13.437 --> 00:18:22.339]  And that $2,800 goal is very realistic because right now the Federal Reserve System is in the bind, in the position that they have to bail out every problem that comes along.
[00:18:22.399 --> 00:18:26.140]  And I don't want to put water on this fire here, but I'm going to be honest with the listeners.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.101]  Your gold isn't going to really be worth $2,800.
[00:18:29.302 --> 00:18:30.642]  It's your dollar, folks.
[00:18:30.822 --> 00:18:33.404]  All you're doing is protecting what wealth you've got left.
[00:18:33.664 --> 00:18:36.105]  This is literal Mayday level right now.
[00:18:36.725 --> 00:18:41.248]  There's no question about it, and anybody that has a half a brain and is watching the markets know that.
[00:18:41.548 --> 00:18:43.789]  Even the economists right now are telling people to get out.
[00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:47.631]  The big people, like you get the Buffetts and that kind of stuff... They already got out years ago.
[00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:50.212]  Oh, there's a reason why they got into the gold and silver markets.
[00:18:50.292 --> 00:18:53.074]  I saw them four years ago begin their evacuation.
[00:18:53.951 --> 00:18:56.012]  They could see it coming.
[00:18:56.872 --> 00:18:58.672]  They know who's playing the hand.
[00:18:59.913 --> 00:19:09.936]  Even if the Federal Reserve System did not want this to occur, it would occur anyways because we've got way, way, way too much debt to what we can produce here in the United States.
[00:19:09.956 --> 00:19:14.357]  The price-earnings ratio is just... it's completely fried.
[00:19:15.661 --> 00:19:17.703]  Well, Alex, that's the whole point.
[00:19:17.843 --> 00:19:20.246]  Economically, things have gone way out of hand.
[00:19:20.866 --> 00:19:21.927]  Nobody wants to admit it.
[00:19:22.067 --> 00:19:24.810]  They don't want to tell that the party's over until it's really over.
[00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:33.038]  I mean, I've got that Oh Yeah book and it talks about, I mean, all the dignitaries of that time were talking about how the stock market was going to come back and how great things were going to be.
[00:19:33.058 --> 00:19:34.379]  I hear the commercial break.
[00:19:34.539 --> 00:19:35.901]  Let's come back and give people that offer.
[00:19:36.481 --> 00:19:41.564]  We get so busy into the economy we don't even tell folks about some special deals that are at last week's prices.
[00:19:41.624 --> 00:19:45.626]  Ted still has some at last week's prices in his vault, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:46.446 --> 00:19:49.147]  And I just wish that I had the capital to get more.
[00:19:49.207 --> 00:19:50.608]  Right now I'm maxed out and can't.
[00:19:51.188 --> 00:19:54.550]  I just wish five, six years ago I'd have put everything into metals.
[00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.131]  But what I did certainly paid off.
[00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:05.264]  Ted Anders from Midas November 2, 2007 Gold 79460 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $818.65, $403.50 per half, $201.75 per quarter.
[00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:05.704]  That's $818.65, $403.50, and $201.75.
[00:20:15.228 --> 00:20:21.191]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:20:21.251 --> 00:20:25.593]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a yon revolution.
[00:20:25.893 --> 00:20:34.358]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:20:34.378 --> 00:20:36.959]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:20:37.259 --> 00:20:41.140]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:47.763]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published a report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[00:20:48.043 --> 00:20:49.203]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:20:49.403 --> 00:20:54.765]  The value of your hard earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[00:20:54.865 --> 00:20:55.145]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:55.165 --> 00:20:55.345]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.746 --> 00:21:01.407]  It's a fact.
[00:21:01.607 --> 00:21:09.097]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:21:09.217 --> 00:21:15.606]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all loans.
[00:21:15.606 --> 00:21:16.126]  I think so.
[00:21:35.431 --> 00:21:40.455]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:21:40.635 --> 00:21:45.139]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:21:45.279 --> 00:21:47.080]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:47.721]  That's 877-943-8600 or visit FDRS.org.
[00:21:47.741 --> 00:21:49.022]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:21:49.042 --> 00:21:49.742]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[00:22:00.663 --> 00:22:04.105]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:22:04.345 --> 00:22:06.466]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:22:06.606 --> 00:22:09.068]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:13.690]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:14.411]  Here's why.
[00:22:14.811 --> 00:22:20.734]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:22:20.754 --> 00:22:27.858]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not cheating.
[00:22:27.858 --> 00:22:28.538]  We're good to go.
[00:23:00.769 --> 00:23:02.050]  Hi Ken, it's Judy again.
[00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:06.594]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[00:23:06.754 --> 00:23:09.896]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[00:23:10.096 --> 00:23:14.340]  It cooks all of our food and then some, plus we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:20.624]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[00:23:20.845 --> 00:23:26.129]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[00:23:26.409 --> 00:23:29.251]  Well Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[00:23:29.391 --> 00:23:30.312]  Go KenSolar!
[00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:33.120]  Get the best of both worlds.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:38.383]  Solar power for your household essentials and a backup generator all in one.
[00:23:38.823 --> 00:23:40.224]  Perfect for hurricane seasons.
[00:23:40.544 --> 00:23:44.026]  No long gas lines, no fumes, and no noise.
[00:23:44.746 --> 00:23:47.408]  Lower your electric bill and be prepared year-round.
[00:23:48.068 --> 00:23:50.390]  Complete solar kits for under $1,200.
[00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:54.732]  See the complete solar power generator kit at KenSolar.com.
[00:23:54.892 --> 00:23:58.714]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[00:24:06.923 --> 00:24:34.097]  I read the news today, oh boy About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad Well, I just had to laugh I saw the photograph
[00:24:37.944 --> 00:24:48.391]  He blew his mind out in a car He didn't notice that the lights had changed
[00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:00.210]  Welcome back.
[00:25:00.931 --> 00:25:08.216]  Ron Paul for 30 years has been talking about how the economy would implode, how the bankers were creating a system to completely consolidate.
[00:25:08.497 --> 00:25:14.821]  They've created a black hole where there's more debt than actual currency and even zeros and ones in their computers.
[00:25:15.562 --> 00:25:21.006]  They are, by design orchestrating this, even the Financial Times of London two months ago admitted that.
[00:25:21.266 --> 00:25:22.147]  The big boys are.
[00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:29.445]  I don't mean the brokerage house down the street, or the little housing loan reseller, or even your local bank, your regional bank.
[00:25:29.905 --> 00:25:30.785]  I mean the big boys.
[00:25:31.686 --> 00:25:34.828]  Now, the question is now, have they overdone it?
[00:25:34.908 --> 00:25:37.409]  They're even worried right now they may have overdone it.
[00:25:37.449 --> 00:25:43.933]  That's what freaks me out, is that these guys just... Well, Ted, just tell them about the offer.
[00:25:45.728 --> 00:25:51.450]  The offer right now, what we have right now available are British Sovereign Gold Coins.
[00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.531]  They're $215 per coin.
[00:25:53.571 --> 00:25:54.792]  Again, gold has gone up.
[00:25:54.992 --> 00:25:56.632]  I'm holding the price at that level.
[00:25:56.692 --> 00:25:58.293]  It's a good buy to be getting into.
[00:25:58.353 --> 00:25:59.373]  It's a quarter of an ounce.
[00:25:59.834 --> 00:26:01.574]  It's something that's private, portable.
[00:26:01.994 --> 00:26:04.175]  Obviously, I could put you anywhere in the United States.
[00:26:04.595 --> 00:26:05.756]  That could be used as money.
[00:26:06.525 --> 00:26:09.089]  The second thing that I'm offering right now are silver dollars.
[00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:14.135]  Silver dollars from the United States back when the silver dollar was a dollar here.
[00:26:14.215 --> 00:26:16.679]  That's what represented real money here in the United States.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.122]  People still recognize them as that.
[00:26:19.603 --> 00:26:20.664]  They're trading for $360 per roll of 20.
[00:26:22.987 --> 00:26:35.379]  And by the way, silver, since we started talking about this Monday, silver's already moved a couple dollars, but that is a fraction of where it's supposed to go to become, to have parity with true dollar value.
[00:26:35.519 --> 00:26:36.720]  It's a sleeper, folks.
[00:26:37.161 --> 00:26:41.265]  Silver is an absolute key to move into aggressively, in my opinion.
[00:26:41.325 --> 00:26:42.066]  Take it or leave it.
[00:26:42.646 --> 00:26:44.508]  And again, tell them about that gold coin again.
[00:26:44.628 --> 00:26:47.210]  Yeah, the gold coin is British Sovereign, $215 per coin.
[00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.132]  You know, it's a quarter of an ounce of gold.
[00:26:51.432 --> 00:26:58.016]  I wish I could turn back the clock and tell everybody to get into these things when they're back at $160 here just a few months ago.
[00:26:58.036 --> 00:27:01.858]  I'm seeing them sold by a lot of other firms, but for $250, $260, $230, I mean $215 is a great deal, Ted.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:14.403]  Well, what it does is it gives us a little bit to help to keep the show going and that kind of thing, but at the same time it gets a lot of gold in people's hands and that's the main thing right now.
[00:27:14.443 --> 00:27:16.063]  I mean, there's a couple things you can do.
[00:27:16.123 --> 00:27:20.044]  If you don't have money, start campaigning for Ron Paul because he's going to make a difference.
[00:27:20.124 --> 00:27:25.606]  If there's anything we can do for this country, let's get Ron Paul as president because that will make a big difference.
[00:27:25.646 --> 00:27:25.706]  Yes.
[00:27:25.726 --> 00:27:30.950]  And he's been pointing out what's really destroying our economy and how it's been done by design and this whole leverage nightmare.
[00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:37.675]  So you've got the quarter-ounce British Sovereigns, you've got the 80 and 100-year-olds, which is what I just got a few weeks ago.
[00:27:38.335 --> 00:27:38.916]  Beautiful.
[00:27:38.936 --> 00:27:41.698]  And they even have a little collector value, but you're getting them near melt.
[00:27:42.378 --> 00:27:43.159]  Silver dollars.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.361]  Do you have any of those Olympics left?
[00:27:45.501 --> 00:27:45.902]  Yeah, we do.
[00:27:45.922 --> 00:27:47.463]  We've got a few of those Olympics left.
[00:27:47.483 --> 00:27:50.905]  You've got to remember, there's only about 600,000 total mintage.
[00:27:50.925 --> 00:27:53.527]  They're trading right now at $590 per coin.
[00:27:54.528 --> 00:28:04.475]  It is in the same ilk or the same category as the $2.50 sesquitennial was in 1926, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt confiscated gold in 1933.
[00:28:04.855 --> 00:28:06.356]  He couldn't take those.
[00:28:06.717 --> 00:28:11.460]  They're exempt under Section 2B of the Executive Order, specifically because the U.S.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.721]  Mint made them as a car IP.
[00:28:13.221 --> 00:28:14.622]  Let's give people the number.
[00:28:14.682 --> 00:28:16.404]  It's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:28:16.824 --> 00:28:19.546]  This is at last week's gold prices.
[00:28:19.667 --> 00:28:23.069]  If you don't tell them it's the Alex Jones Special, it's going to be a lot more.
[00:28:23.089 --> 00:28:23.610]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.851]  I know Ted has limited supplies of these.
[00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:26.652]  He is running out.
[00:28:26.672 --> 00:28:26.732]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:28:26.752 --> 00:28:27.953]  How are you doing on the silver supply?
[00:28:35.259 --> 00:28:37.521]  Well, that is a big issue.
[00:28:37.741 --> 00:28:42.406]  The market is getting so hot right now, to be able to get supplies is getting to be tougher.
[00:28:42.426 --> 00:28:51.955]  I mean, I do have, I've been in the market for 30 years, so I have connections to just about every venue in the market, but all across the board, dealers are running short on supply.
[00:28:52.075 --> 00:28:54.377]  But you're holding the sovereigns and the silver.
[00:28:54.677 --> 00:28:55.778]  Yep, we've got everything.
[00:28:56.639 --> 00:29:06.526]  If you place your order here, you're going to get them, and you'll get them quickly, and we'll be happy to fill the orders and get them to you.
[00:29:06.546 --> 00:29:08.367]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:29:08.387 --> 00:29:09.048]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:29:09.428 --> 00:29:11.309]  Give them a call right now, folks.
[00:29:11.329 --> 00:29:14.612]  You know, I used to have Ted on every two months, every three months, every six months sometimes.
[00:29:14.972 --> 00:29:17.094]  I'm having him on every other day right now because
[00:29:17.834 --> 00:29:28.420]  Again, folks, this is a good deal, and this is what's happening, and if we can hurt the globalists, and not have them completely rape all the patriots, that would be a good thing, and it also helps the network in what Ted's doing.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:28.580]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.463]  Ted, thanks for coming on.
[00:29:32.683 --> 00:29:33.923]  Hey, thanks for having me up again, Alex.
[00:29:34.104 --> 00:29:34.384]  You bet.
[00:29:34.404 --> 00:29:35.604]  There'll be brokers there all weekend.
[00:29:35.624 --> 00:29:36.965]  That deal stands for the weekend, right?
[00:29:37.145 --> 00:29:37.726]  Absolutely.
[00:29:37.746 --> 00:29:37.966]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:29:38.146 --> 00:29:39.807]  They'll be there until 10 o'clock tonight, Central, as well.
[00:29:39.827 --> 00:29:39.867]  800-686-2237.
[00:29:39.887 --> 00:29:40.988]  Your call's coming in straight ahead.
[00:29:51.309 --> 00:29:54.312]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.233 --> 00:29:57.915]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:00.715 --> 00:31:03.057]  America is the fattest nation on the planet.
[00:31:03.157 --> 00:31:09.661]  The obesity epidemic kills over 300,000 Americans each and every year, and this number continues to rise at an alarming rate.
[00:31:09.821 --> 00:31:12.923]  With fast food chains everywhere, eating right is not an easy task.
[00:31:13.143 --> 00:31:16.285]  It's time to stop eating those unhealthy meals and fattening snacks.
[00:31:16.545 --> 00:31:19.207]  Assured that you and your family do not become a statistic.
[00:31:19.447 --> 00:31:21.668]  Introducing the Excalibur Dehydrator.

[00:32:00.972 --> 00:32:02.814]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:32:02.954 --> 00:32:09.660]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:18.107]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:32:18.307 --> 00:32:24.052]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:32:24.352 --> 00:32:24.632]  I think so.
[00:32:42.611 --> 00:32:43.252]  We're good to go.
[00:33:23.163 --> 00:33:24.324]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:24.344 --> 00:33:26.886]  Thank you for joining us on this live Friday edition.
[00:33:28.347 --> 00:33:33.330]  We're watching the unraveling of the economy on the good side, a deep, prolonged recession.
[00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:39.294]  I'm hoping for that, instead of absolute financial implosion, financial Armageddon.
[00:33:42.248 --> 00:33:44.448]  The elite have gotten out of dollars years ago.
[00:33:44.508 --> 00:33:46.909]  They positioned themselves, the vice president, the president.
[00:33:48.369 --> 00:33:50.550]  I'm not going to belabor what's happening with the economy anymore.
[00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:52.910]  You're welcome to call in about it and give me your take on it.
[00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:58.751]  Now we've got stockbrokers and commodity traders and everybody else out there listening and constantly emailing and calling.
[00:33:58.771 --> 00:34:04.872]  We're going to take a lot of calls and the problem with that is I'm not going to give each one of you very much time so don't be mad at me if I hang up on you.
[00:34:04.892 --> 00:34:10.073]  Don't be mad if I can't give you some long ten hour answer because we just can't get to all your calls if I do that.
[00:34:10.828 --> 00:34:11.949]  It's got to be short and sweet.
[00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:15.251]  Coming up, Britain's colossal food waste is stoking climate change.
[00:34:15.271 --> 00:34:19.693]  We're going to have social workers watching you, controlling you, making you exercise every day.
[00:34:19.733 --> 00:34:20.694]  This is total control.
[00:34:20.714 --> 00:34:23.596]  Global warming bill advances in the Senate.
[00:34:23.636 --> 00:34:25.096]  That's the taxation bill.
[00:34:27.298 --> 00:34:32.261]  Foreign Relations Committee approves the Treaty of the Sea Treaty, or the Law of the Sea Treaty.
[00:34:32.301 --> 00:34:32.721]  Lost.
[00:34:33.421 --> 00:34:34.282]  Absolutely horrible.
[00:34:35.703 --> 00:34:46.232]  They also ran through, as you know, through the House, a Thought Crimes Bill, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, where it says they're going to list what thought crimes are and what you're not allowed to have, and literal book burning.
[00:34:46.292 --> 00:34:48.554]  I mean, it's just, you can't, it's all happening!
[00:34:49.054 --> 00:34:58.162]  Total fruitcake police state, on steroids, while the borders are wide open and the illegal aliens don't have to have IDs to get driver's licenses or cars or anything else.
[00:34:58.622 --> 00:35:01.184]  I mean, my point is, it's just, it's nothing to do with security.
[00:35:01.204 --> 00:35:02.926]  It's about raping the daylights out of us.
[00:35:06.022 --> 00:35:07.463]  Stock prices again dropped below $3.70.
[00:35:11.326 --> 00:35:12.467]  Unwelcoming U.S.
[00:35:12.487 --> 00:35:14.208]  to see sharp fall in visitors since 9-11.
[00:35:14.848 --> 00:35:16.570]  You think the Commissar is running this country care?
[00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.212]  Memo approves Rumsfeld-directed psychological terror campaign.
[00:35:20.252 --> 00:35:22.274]  Incredible story up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:25.436 --> 00:35:28.278]  Merrill Lynch shares hit two-year low on hedge fund report.
[00:35:29.179 --> 00:35:30.079]  Massive losses.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:35.383]  And the big central banks still aren't buying these corporate
[00:35:36.323 --> 00:35:36.623]  Paper.
[00:35:36.803 --> 00:35:38.844]  They're not buying these mortgages and things.
[00:35:39.144 --> 00:35:41.784]  It's just... It's all by design.
[00:35:42.004 --> 00:35:51.286]  While they act like they're trying to save the economy, they're just slowing the collapse of it, which they want an orderly collapse, while doing everything they can to accentuate the destruction of the dollar and the economy.
[00:35:51.366 --> 00:35:52.246]  I mean, we're watching them.
[00:35:52.766 --> 00:35:56.387]  It's one thing to create a fiat currency, get everybody in debt, get everything leveraged out.
[00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:57.267]  That's bad enough.
[00:35:58.447 --> 00:36:00.048]  Because the chickens will come home to roost.
[00:36:00.128 --> 00:36:01.988]  But to be trying to pop it,
[00:36:03.721 --> 00:36:04.542]  I'm so mad.
[00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:08.266]  I mean, really, folks, because I know what this means.
[00:36:08.486 --> 00:36:11.349]  See, I'm not a person who just thinks in the minute or the hour of the day.
[00:36:11.729 --> 00:36:13.331]  I know what this means middle of next year.
[00:36:14.292 --> 00:36:15.193]  You think it's bad now?
[00:36:15.433 --> 00:36:16.254]  Okay, I already said that.
[00:36:17.395 --> 00:36:18.936]  I'm literally shocked.
[00:36:19.117 --> 00:36:21.079]  I'm almost speechless right now.
[00:36:21.499 --> 00:36:26.444]  We are seeing it, everything that was foretold by these creatures, now unfolding.
[00:36:33.698 --> 00:36:41.223]  AP urges news industry to embrace online system, says that the mainline media is literally imploding right now, so there's some good things happening.
[00:36:43.625 --> 00:36:46.847]  We're going to be going over all of that, but as I promised, we're going to go to your calls.
[00:36:46.887 --> 00:36:58.594]  Just a brief note here, next Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, not Tuesday, next Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the final showings in Central Texas of Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:36:58.614 --> 00:36:59.635]  You ask for more showings,
[00:37:01.013 --> 00:37:06.075]  We've had seven sellout showings and then one that didn't sell out because people didn't think I was going to be there because I wasn't going to be there.
[00:37:06.495 --> 00:37:08.235]  So yes, if you want to see me, I'll be there.
[00:37:08.275 --> 00:37:09.836]  I enjoy giving a speech, taking questions.
[00:37:10.336 --> 00:37:13.657]  And that's Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:37:13.997 --> 00:37:16.538]  Link through on PrisonPlanet.com and InforWars.com.
[00:37:16.558 --> 00:37:18.958]  You see the big banners for the Alamo Draft House to buy tickets online.
[00:37:19.279 --> 00:37:22.119]  Or if you live in Austin, you can buy tickets there anytime you want.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.921]  They hold back about 20, 30 tickets to the hour before, so you can pretty much always get in.
[00:37:27.461 --> 00:37:32.603]  It always just sells out, so I hope to see you there next Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday at Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:37:32.643 --> 00:37:37.244]  That film is now out at PrisonPlanet.tv and you can get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:37:39.204 --> 00:37:42.365]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric in California.
[00:37:42.405 --> 00:37:43.206]  Thanks for holding, Eric.
[00:37:45.986 --> 00:37:46.427]  Hi, Eric.
[00:37:46.447 --> 00:37:50.028]  Okay, go ahead and let him go.
[00:37:50.928 --> 00:37:52.048]  David in California.
[00:37:52.068 --> 00:37:52.668]  You're on the air.
[00:37:52.708 --> 00:37:53.108]  Go ahead.
[00:37:54.149 --> 00:37:54.469]  Hi there.
[00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:56.149]  Oh, okay.
[00:37:56.249 --> 00:37:58.030]  Actually, I thought you were saying, Eric in California.
[00:37:58.070 --> 00:37:58.910]  I said, my name is Dave.
[00:37:59.031 --> 00:38:01.051]  You know, listen, brother, I was going to Eric.
[00:38:01.131 --> 00:38:02.072]  He wasn't there.
[00:38:02.552 --> 00:38:04.753]  So now I'm going to you, David, from California.
[00:38:05.233 --> 00:38:05.553]  I'm here.
[00:38:05.914 --> 00:38:07.794]  Actually, I got two questions for you.
[00:38:08.155 --> 00:38:14.837]  Just over the past, what, five months, how much, roughly, how much money has the Fed pumped into the market?
[00:38:15.798 --> 00:38:21.000]  The Fed has only pumped in about $200 billion.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.541]  And that's a guesstimation.
[00:38:23.641 --> 00:38:24.922]  And the Europeans have put in
[00:38:26.059 --> 00:38:32.822]  Last time I checked a month ago on their face it was about 220 billion or so and I know the Asians put in a bunch.
[00:38:32.882 --> 00:38:35.523]  So when I say 400 billion earlier that was wrong.
[00:38:35.563 --> 00:38:37.243]  It's got to be over 500 plus billion now.
[00:38:37.263 --> 00:38:41.485]  I mean you can just go look at all the news articles and add it all up but it's over 500 billion.
[00:38:42.185 --> 00:38:42.966]  Right, okay.
[00:38:43.606 --> 00:38:45.226]  So that's insane.
[00:38:45.667 --> 00:38:46.347]  Does it make sense?
[00:38:47.031 --> 00:38:52.314]  Well, they have to, or there'll be a complete depression and the market will drop down to a thousand points.
[00:38:52.774 --> 00:39:00.919]  I mean, literally, there is a total credit crisis and the big central banks are not buying the mortgages.
[00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:09.404]  They're just injecting money back into the markets and injecting money into the lower banks to cover it, but then they're going to go bankrupt and the big banks get to buy them up.
[00:39:10.044 --> 00:39:10.204]  Right.
[00:39:10.684 --> 00:39:12.005]  So they're actually making it worse.
[00:39:12.045 --> 00:39:15.067]  It's like Treasury Secretary Paulson said two weeks ago,
[00:39:16.548 --> 00:39:24.070]  Told banks to give more loans to people that already have double mortgages, to pay it out, and this is insane.
[00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:29.411]  Yeah, they're trying to get everybody hooked, so they can come in and say, here, we've got a solution.
[00:39:29.791 --> 00:39:32.652]  In fact, they know our only solution, and we need to protect them.
[00:39:32.672 --> 00:39:34.412]  He's a national treasure now, is Ron Paul.
[00:39:35.432 --> 00:39:37.793]  Well, he's the one that's been breaking this down for decades.
[00:39:38.273 --> 00:39:39.953]  We've been breaking it down for more than a decade.
[00:39:39.993 --> 00:39:40.793]  It's now happening.
[00:39:40.853 --> 00:39:42.334]  All the warnings, everything we talked about.
[00:39:42.614 --> 00:39:43.654]  I mean, listen, let me explain this.
[00:39:44.508 --> 00:39:55.177]  We had horrible stagflation and a deep recession that almost went depressionary in 1980, but then we came out of it because of massive spending and tax cuts together.
[00:39:55.498 --> 00:39:59.621]  You can debate all day whether that was good or bad, but the point is it got us out of it for a while.
[00:40:01.023 --> 00:40:05.767]  That was a massive crisis because of the huge debt rate, private and corporate and government debt.
[00:40:06.803 --> 00:40:19.335]  And because of the currency crisis, now it's thousands and thousands of times deeper, the leveraging, the debt, the over-leveraged derivatives, and the P.E.
[00:40:19.415 --> 00:40:21.917]  ratios, price earnings ratios, and all of it.
[00:40:22.637 --> 00:40:30.605]  And so, now we're seeing a late 1970s paradigm, but with much worse conditions.
[00:40:31.405 --> 00:40:33.267]  As Ron Paul has been saying, I mean, this is just
[00:40:34.791 --> 00:40:35.992]  That's unbelievable, folks.
[00:40:36.332 --> 00:40:41.096]  I mean, this is... I cannot describe how serious it is.
[00:40:42.117 --> 00:40:42.937]  It's bad, bad.
[00:40:43.157 --> 00:40:43.558]  Cancer.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.561]  And it's induced cancer.
[00:40:47.601 --> 00:40:48.082]  Anything else?
[00:40:48.882 --> 00:40:49.543]  That's it, man.
[00:40:49.643 --> 00:40:51.845]  I'm out here in California.
[00:40:51.885 --> 00:40:52.825]  I'll be honest with you.
[00:40:52.926 --> 00:40:55.368]  Out here in California, you're like Ron Paul.
[00:40:55.408 --> 00:40:56.448]  They're like Ron Paul.
[00:40:56.508 --> 00:40:57.269]  I gotta get to work.
[00:40:57.289 --> 00:40:58.310]  I gotta get these signs up.
[00:40:58.846 --> 00:41:06.391]  Yesterday I tried to get a hold of you, I got a hold of Jack, and I mentioned Ron Paul, and he actually put me together because everybody I talk to out here doesn't know Ron Paul yet.
[00:41:06.892 --> 00:41:08.693]  Alright man, listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:10.174]  I appreciate your call, David.
[00:41:10.794 --> 00:41:15.578]  No, they know about Dog using the N-word, they know about OJ and his arrest in Las Vegas.
[00:41:16.292 --> 00:41:21.215]  They know about Oprah Winfrey who tried to do a good thing with the girls school and of course they're going to have a pervert in there.
[00:41:21.755 --> 00:41:26.698]  And that's in your public schools, your private schools, and now Oprah's apologizing and it's a big scandal.
[00:41:26.718 --> 00:41:31.080]  Meanwhile the UN can kidnap hundreds of thousands of children a year admittedly and no one cares.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:37.183]  And again, CPS in Florida can have 3,000 plus missing and some are found with their heads chopped off in shallow graves.
[00:41:37.544 --> 00:41:38.224]  Others in Europe
[00:41:40.183 --> 00:41:40.683]  Not news.
[00:41:40.864 --> 00:41:48.368]  See, I mean, the public has been trained to care about little, tertiary, individual issues, and not be able to see the big issues.
[00:41:49.849 --> 00:41:51.150]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:41:52.811 --> 00:42:01.116]  Let's go ahead, but they're mad at Oprah because she talked about mad cow, and now she's talking about Mercury and the vaccine, so they might actually just tear her to pieces now.
[00:42:02.157 --> 00:42:05.279]  She's just gotta be dealt with, I guess, by the New World Order.
[00:42:06.119 --> 00:42:08.501]  Let's go ahead and talk to Judy in Boston, Mass.
[00:42:08.521 --> 00:42:09.081]  Go ahead, Judy.
[00:42:10.117 --> 00:42:10.458]  Alex?
[00:42:10.678 --> 00:42:10.998]  Hi!
[00:42:11.018 --> 00:42:12.360]  Hi, how are you?
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.741]  Good, doing a worldwide transmission.
[00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:15.143]  How can I help you?
[00:42:15.383 --> 00:42:19.067]  I would like you to help me make a decision here about the stock market.
[00:42:20.128 --> 00:42:26.155]  Is it your guess that it is not going to come back up again like it did recently?
[00:42:26.175 --> 00:42:28.378]  Or is it just on its way down now?
[00:42:30.259 --> 00:42:31.579]  Well, let me explain something.
[00:42:31.619 --> 00:42:36.621]  You could study derivatives for your whole life and not know 10% about them.
[00:42:37.161 --> 00:42:41.983]  I mean, this is for the general listener, so let me just put you on hold and answer your question and I'll come back to you.
[00:42:43.783 --> 00:42:44.864]  You could study U.S.
[00:42:45.324 --> 00:42:48.145]  securities for your whole life and never know 5% about it.
[00:42:48.805 --> 00:42:52.166]  You could study the car dealing market and never understand it.
[00:42:52.762 --> 00:42:57.063]  You could study how the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee works and never fully understand it.
[00:42:57.083 --> 00:43:03.364]  I mean, they get top bankers in there who run this system, and they all debate and argue with each other about how to best fleece us.
[00:43:03.384 --> 00:43:06.825]  So there's a huge world, trillions of dollars changing hands every day.
[00:43:07.325 --> 00:43:18.507]  It's very complex, but basically it's a bunch of Ponzi schemes like Russian dolls inside other Ponzi schemes, inside other larger balloons and Ponzi schemes.
[00:43:18.847 --> 00:43:19.967]  And the big central banks
[00:43:20.757 --> 00:43:28.961]  Kind of like guiding a stampede of bison, or elephants try to guide it and try to surf it and control it, they don't even fully control it.
[00:43:31.903 --> 00:43:37.786]  But they know the bubble has to implode at some point, so they position themselves to try to consolidate as much as possible.
[00:43:38.346 --> 00:43:47.651]  See, they get their power through the fiat system, and they consolidate to the fiat system, but then it's even dangerous for them when they go into these contraction periods.
[00:43:48.422 --> 00:43:51.263]  So let me just say that I am no expert in any of this.
[00:43:52.103 --> 00:44:08.750]  I know more in general knowledge than most stockbrokers or most people that are in commodities or even most local bank branch managers because they're all specialized in their little area.
[00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:14.572]  But I am not going to sit here and give you advice on what you should do with your stock portfolio.
[00:44:15.092 --> 00:44:17.533]  I personally wouldn't own any stocks.
[00:44:18.652 --> 00:44:19.673]  Let me expand on that.
[00:44:20.894 --> 00:44:24.738]  I personally have gone into some metals.
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:27.400]  It's not that much.
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:31.524]  I mean, if I tried to run my business for six months on what I've got, if everything fell through, I wouldn't be here anymore.
[00:44:33.126 --> 00:44:39.952]  And, you know, I have to try to take care of my family and just shut things down at the point where I wouldn't even have enough to buy food for my family.
[00:44:39.972 --> 00:44:41.173]  That's why I have some affordable foods.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:48.682]  This is a very, very complex issue, and I said I'd take a lot of calls and move quick, but it's such a big deal.
[00:44:49.502 --> 00:45:06.890]  I mean, look, I'm no genius, but I can watch Google stock, Apple stock, certain technology stocks over time that are very aggressive and cutting edge, and I don't know if you should get into Google or Apple now, but certainly five years ago, we said Google and Apple are pretty good places to be.
[00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:08.791]  Google's at $700 a share and a $218 billion value.
[00:45:13.281 --> 00:45:13.921]  I don't know.
[00:45:38.175 --> 00:45:40.837]  I will morally not invest in Google stocks and things like that.
[00:45:41.497 --> 00:45:47.661]  But in a larger situation, my assets aren't great enough to diversify into stocks.
[00:45:48.081 --> 00:45:48.942]  They're so meager.
[00:45:48.962 --> 00:45:52.284]  I mean, if I had some great assets, I might have something in stocks.
[00:45:52.304 --> 00:45:55.566]  But the problem is, you can't get that if there's an all-out depression.
[00:45:56.466 --> 00:46:01.449]  You can't get that if there's an IMF World Bank designed IMF riot, as they call it.
[00:46:01.669 --> 00:46:06.592]  I mean, the IMF likes to bring a country completely down, turn off the water, turn off the power.
[00:46:06.953 --> 00:46:07.673]  They own it.
[00:46:08.425 --> 00:46:12.828]  In these countries, to cause a total devaluation down to almost zero.
[00:46:13.248 --> 00:46:15.149]  It never gets completely there, but near zero.
[00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:21.914]  And, I guess in Germany and a few other cases, it has gone to absolute zero, as the congressman's talked about, Ron Paul.
[00:46:22.754 --> 00:46:27.197]  So, you need to physically hold assets.
[00:46:28.058 --> 00:46:29.298]  And it needs to be diversified.
[00:46:29.359 --> 00:46:30.179]  Gold, silver.
[00:46:30.219 --> 00:46:34.942]  If you've got a farm, you know, tractor, cars, four-wheelers, guns,
[00:46:38.652 --> 00:46:39.773]  You know, things like that.
[00:46:41.134 --> 00:46:47.978]  If you've got meager assets, I mean, if you've got huge assets, they've already gone into, you know, foreign hedge funds.
[00:46:48.018 --> 00:46:50.360]  They've already, we've got to have a million dollars even get in.
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.221]  They've already gone into metals.
[00:46:52.261 --> 00:47:00.286]  They've already got, you know, accounts in Luxembourg and in the Bahamas and in Spain and Portugal and Switzerland.
[00:47:00.306 --> 00:47:00.567]  I mean, look.
[00:47:03.542 --> 00:47:06.224]  So it also depends what type of investor you are.
[00:47:06.304 --> 00:47:15.089]  The point is, I would want things you can physically hold, because the market is that volatile and dangerous.
[00:47:15.489 --> 00:47:17.231]  Will the market go back up next week?
[00:47:17.291 --> 00:47:17.691]  It might.
[00:47:17.791 --> 00:47:19.992]  But if you look at the trend, it's going down.
[00:47:20.032 --> 00:47:21.873]  You go, wait a minute, it just hit 14,000 something.
[00:47:21.933 --> 00:47:22.374]  It's going up.
[00:47:23.174 --> 00:47:24.455]  Again, it's really at $7,004 value.
[00:47:24.475 --> 00:47:25.075]  So it's down by half.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.200]  We're good to go!
[00:47:49.309 --> 00:48:01.017]  And there's so many panics going, and so many industries, so many finance industries over-leveraged by design, that it's just bomb after bomb that's going to go off in a chain reaction.
[00:48:01.037 --> 00:48:03.478]  We've just seen the first few explosions.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:12.785]  I hope that answers your question, Judy, and I'm very thankful and very humbled that you would want my opinion.
[00:48:12.805 --> 00:48:14.866]  I mean, what type of stocks do you have, Judy?
[00:48:15.905 --> 00:48:17.787]  To tell you the truth, I don't even know.
[00:48:17.887 --> 00:48:19.588]  Someone is handling them for me.
[00:48:20.168 --> 00:48:21.730]  So you're not in a mutual fund?
[00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:23.271]  Yeah, something like that.
[00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:25.192]  What type of mutual fund?
[00:48:25.753 --> 00:48:28.135]  But let me just tell you quickly how I stand.
[00:48:28.515 --> 00:48:32.398]  Probably two-thirds of my life savings are in this stock account.
[00:48:33.519 --> 00:48:35.861]  I've made a lot of money over the past year.
[00:48:36.437 --> 00:48:37.378]  Now I see you calling again.
[00:48:37.398 --> 00:48:37.538]  Pardon?
[00:48:37.558 --> 00:48:37.879]  I understand.
[00:48:37.899 --> 00:48:40.181]  But the numbers have gone up, Alex.
[00:48:56.124 --> 00:48:59.989]  You know, however many paltry dollars I have, I have more of them now than I ever did.
[00:49:00.009 --> 00:49:04.175]  No, I know you don't want to hear your money's been devalued, but I have to tell you... I understand that perfectly.
[00:49:04.395 --> 00:49:11.484]  Now let me just quickly ask you, you're telling me what my gut's telling me, but do I put all of that into gold, or...
[00:49:13.958 --> 00:49:15.680]  No, I would not put all of it into gold.
[00:49:16.581 --> 00:49:22.568]  And I would look around, get different prices, get bullion as close to spot, as close to melt, as you can get it.
[00:49:22.628 --> 00:49:24.871]  I mean, let's say gold's $800 an ounce right now.
[00:49:25.291 --> 00:49:27.113]  People got to add some markup in there.
[00:49:28.375 --> 00:49:29.737]  But I wouldn't go for more than 3-4% markup.
[00:49:31.919 --> 00:49:40.645]  I mean, that's what I'd do, and I'd go 20% into it, and I'd take physical possession, and I'd put it in a vault in another state.
[00:49:40.985 --> 00:49:45.629]  I wouldn't physically hold it at your house, and I wouldn't let anybody know you hold gold or silver.
[00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:49.051]  But also, you may be in European stocks.
[00:49:49.091 --> 00:49:50.693]  You may be in currency stocks.
[00:49:51.133 --> 00:49:57.778]  You may be, see, I don't know what your portfolio is, but even European stocks, what's happening here is going to end up dragging them down over there.
[00:49:58.351 --> 00:50:02.434]  Yeah, I'm going to have to check into that before I call my person here.
[00:50:03.214 --> 00:50:08.638]  You know, the last time I called him, way back when you were, you know, starting to say Red Alert.
[00:50:08.778 --> 00:50:09.578]  Did he bully you?
[00:50:09.619 --> 00:50:12.100]  He had no clue what was going on at that time.
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:14.502]  Oh my dear, believe me, he has a clue.
[00:50:14.922 --> 00:50:15.763]  Well, he does now.
[00:50:15.863 --> 00:50:16.463]  I know he does.
[00:50:16.803 --> 00:50:18.124]  Well, no, no, they have a clue.
[00:50:18.745 --> 00:50:22.587]  And listen, the worst thing I want to do is just put stuff in stocks and not watch these guys like hawks.
[00:50:22.967 --> 00:50:24.008]  Are you with a big company?
[00:50:26.348 --> 00:50:28.550]  Yes, I can't even tell you the name of it right now.
[00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:31.833]  I was unprepared to give any kind of that information.
[00:50:32.814 --> 00:50:36.136]  Was it like Vanguard or something like Fidelity?
[00:50:37.177 --> 00:50:37.898]  Yeah, maybe.
[00:50:38.799 --> 00:50:44.363]  Number one, you shouldn't have... I can't even find a thing here to tell you at the moment, but it's a known name.
[00:50:45.965 --> 00:50:46.165]  Well...
[00:50:48.024 --> 00:50:51.986]  I mean, you might wait a week and see if it goes back up a little bit and get out some.
[00:50:52.026 --> 00:50:56.729]  I mean, if you got two-thirds of your money in the stock market, I personally wouldn't have that much in there.
[00:50:56.769 --> 00:50:58.150]  But hey, I'm not going to give you advice.
[00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:59.931]  I'm not giving you advice.
[00:51:01.292 --> 00:51:02.713]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.773 --> 00:51:04.814]  A new world order.
[00:51:05.534 --> 00:51:10.277]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:10.437 --> 00:51:12.178]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:51:13.259 --> 00:51:15.420]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:16.024 --> 00:51:18.488]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:26.561]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:29.562 --> 00:51:34.545]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.026 --> 00:51:38.508]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:38.888 --> 00:51:41.390]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:42.411]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:42.431 --> 00:51:43.371]  They're not after money.
[00:51:43.391 --> 00:51:44.472]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:44.672 --> 00:51:45.453]  They're after power.
[00:51:45.653 --> 00:51:46.533]  That's their appetite.

[00:51:55.159 --> 00:51:55.980]  Endgame.
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.801]  We prep for global enslaving.
[00:51:58.441 --> 00:51:59.522]  You have been warned.
[00:52:00.523 --> 00:52:03.686]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:03.726 --> 00:52:07.769]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:07.909 --> 00:52:10.471]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:10.531 --> 00:52:12.853]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:13.034 --> 00:52:21.500]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:21.561 --> 00:52:22.882]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:52:23.002 --> 00:52:27.005]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:27.005 --> 00:52:27.505]  We're good to go!

[00:54:03.469 --> 00:54:09.475]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:09.495 --> 00:54:13.079]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:13.539 --> 00:54:17.003]  Yeah, that old liner we've had for 10 years isn't a joke.
[00:54:18.985 --> 00:54:20.546]  Before that, I had another guy doing the announcements.
[00:54:20.566 --> 00:54:21.247]  I've been doing that for 12, 13 years.
[00:54:22.885 --> 00:54:24.546]  We are occupied by the Federal Reserve.
[00:54:24.586 --> 00:54:26.207]  We are in occupied United States.
[00:54:26.247 --> 00:54:27.968]  We are held by a private corporation.
[00:54:28.429 --> 00:54:32.311]  That's an absolute fact you can document for yourself in five minutes in the white pages.
[00:54:33.292 --> 00:54:34.052]  The Federal Reserve.
[00:54:34.393 --> 00:54:35.073]  And it's private.
[00:54:36.254 --> 00:54:44.699]  And we are behind enemy lines here and it's our job to reach out to the police, the military and others and explain to them, just like the public's been brainwashed, they have been brainwashed.
[00:54:44.719 --> 00:54:48.682]  Before I go to Bob and Eric and others that are patiently holding
[00:54:50.257 --> 00:55:05.544]  I do want to ask folks to pray for this country because I think that that really does do some good and I believe in God and I believe that if we repent and seek his face and turn from our wicked ways that things can get a lot better.
[00:55:06.104 --> 00:55:10.386]  We are a nation that has had 50 plus million abortions with no regard for life and
[00:55:11.132 --> 00:55:25.544]  You know, no regard for a new precious dear tender life, and we made all these excuses and rationales, and now we've got euthanasia of the old, and we've been sold at some type of wonderful right, and that's really one of the crimes of the controlled left.
[00:55:26.705 --> 00:55:35.152]  Do you think you're not going to have a tyrannical government with torture and wickedness and killing and evil and wars, when you've already rationalized and said, kill the old people, kill the babies?
[00:55:36.313 --> 00:55:39.155]  That's all I'm trying to say there, so I hope you'll listen to me on that fact.
[00:55:40.187 --> 00:55:41.449]  Let's talk to Bob in Wyoming.
[00:55:41.489 --> 00:55:42.871]  Bob, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:55:45.334 --> 00:55:45.854]  Hello, Bob.
[00:55:46.015 --> 00:55:49.539]  I was watching a protest on Fox News last night.
[00:55:49.659 --> 00:55:52.503]  It almost certainly was a CIA psyop protest.
[00:55:52.543 --> 00:55:54.045]  Did you see it about this grave?
[00:55:54.645 --> 00:55:55.867]  This dead soldier's funeral?
[00:55:56.835 --> 00:56:02.138]  And this church of protesters were holding up these signs that looked like they were made in a factory.
[00:56:02.678 --> 00:56:05.520]  And Fox News had its cameras already pre-positioned.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:09.422]  This is supposedly an impromptu protest that they didn't know was coming.
[00:56:09.442 --> 00:56:12.144]  Yeah, for those that don't know about it, fill them in on the background.
[00:56:12.804 --> 00:56:15.585]  Well, I don't know much about the soldier or anything.
[00:56:15.605 --> 00:56:16.146]  But give them the basics.
[00:56:16.166 --> 00:56:19.868]  He died in combat in Iraq, and they had his funeral yesterday back east somewhere.
[00:56:20.863 --> 00:56:28.332]  And these people from this church showed up, supposedly, according to their story, and held these signs, and that's what convinced me it's a PSYOP.
[00:56:28.913 --> 00:56:32.818]  The signs are perfectly colored, so you can see them from a long distance away.
[00:56:32.838 --> 00:56:36.663]  And every other protest I've seen, the signs are kinda amateurish, you know.
[00:56:37.702 --> 00:56:38.423]  And what did the signs say?
[00:57:08.778 --> 00:57:25.113]  It has been declassified that in the 60s during COINTELPRO, they would send, and they would have young kids following them and hippies and yippies and beatniks that didn't know, but they would send into small towns and they would have news film cameras there, reporters there who would be told just to go there.
[00:57:25.911 --> 00:57:26.832]  They wouldn't be in on it.
[00:57:27.412 --> 00:57:36.079]  And they would yell and cuss and break out windows and just urinate on the walls and do all of this for the cameras.
[00:57:36.199 --> 00:57:42.503]  And we've seen the cops dressed up like anarchists trying to attack other police so they can attack peaceful crowds.
[00:57:42.543 --> 00:57:43.684]  That's now been admitted.
[00:57:43.724 --> 00:57:47.307]  They do that all over the country and all over Europe and Canada.
[00:57:47.847 --> 00:57:50.869]  And so, yes, I did hear that they were in the protest.
[00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:54.012]  They did other protests where they said these horrible things, this group.
[00:57:54.692 --> 00:58:14.280]  And there is no doubt that what you're saying has serious merit, and I need to do more investigation, because that will certainly backfire, and now O'Reilly's calling for that group to be banned from having their free speech, and he tied them this week in the 9-11 truth groups, and mixed us in with it, saying we're violent.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:15.141]  So see the PSYOP?
[00:58:17.622 --> 00:58:18.102]  Anything else?
[00:58:19.059 --> 00:58:19.319]  See?
[00:58:19.579 --> 00:58:25.380]  They're playing the perfect villain, just like Ahmadinejad said exactly what they wanted him to say to provoke a war.
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:28.141]  And I think Ahmadinejad's on the payroll.
[00:58:28.281 --> 00:58:33.642]  I don't know what to think, but I know... Well, we know the CIA let him fly in the eye of the Homo Humani in 79.
[00:58:33.702 --> 00:58:34.262]  We know that.
[00:58:34.922 --> 00:58:36.102]  Alright, good point, sir.
[00:58:36.142 --> 00:58:37.503]  We'll have a look more into it.
[00:58:37.563 --> 00:58:38.843]  We'll be right back.

[00:58:58.514 --> 00:58:59.615]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:00.275 --> 00:59:01.396]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.037 --> 00:59:02.877]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.618 --> 00:59:04.578]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.179 --> 00:59:08.841]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.362 --> 00:59:13.485]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.914 --> 00:59:32.198]  We are now into our number two on this Friday edition, second day of November 2007.
[00:59:33.519 --> 00:59:36.581]  Wide open phones for the full three hours at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:36.621 --> 00:59:43.766]  I'm going to take a couple more swaths of calls here.
[00:59:43.786 --> 00:59:49.410]  We're going to get into a bunch of global warming, global tax news moving through the Senate right now.
[00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:52.472]  Also, the lost treaty, the
[00:59:53.729 --> 00:59:54.389]  Good Alex, how are you?
[01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:24.452]  Well, I'm not too good.
[01:00:24.472 --> 01:00:25.493]  The country's in a lot of trouble.
[01:00:25.933 --> 01:00:26.894]  Yeah, now I hear ya.
[01:00:26.914 --> 01:00:31.477]  Well, and I have an emergency bulletin to pass on to you and to your listeners.
[01:00:32.237 --> 01:00:41.484]  The Coast Guard, since it moved into Homeland Security in 2003 from the Department of Transportation, is self-declaring itself to be a branch of military.
[01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:46.868]  There's been quite some confusion over time, whether it has been or if it's been paramilitary.
[01:00:48.089 --> 01:00:51.712]  It's always been a civil service in a time of declared war.
[01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:56.594]  It moves under and becomes part of the Navy, just like the United States Merchant Marine does.
[01:00:56.614 --> 01:00:58.195]  That's one reason why I have a Naval Commission.
[01:00:58.875 --> 01:01:12.624]  What they're doing, though, is they're carrying on military tribunals of civilians here on American soil within Coast Guard proceedings of ships' captains, tugboat captains, engineers, and others.
[01:01:12.725 --> 01:01:18.929]  You're telling me they are now engaging in maritime admiralty law tribunals against U.S.
[01:01:18.949 --> 01:01:19.469]  citizens?
[01:01:19.989 --> 01:01:20.710]  Unbelievable.
[01:01:21.249 --> 01:01:27.492]  Yes, and they're actually using Judge Advocate General Corps officers in uniform, in military uniform.
[01:01:27.532 --> 01:01:30.194]  For those who don't know, that's the military going out and grabbing U.S.
[01:01:30.214 --> 01:01:30.634]  citizens.
[01:01:30.654 --> 01:01:31.434]  That's incredible.
[01:01:32.315 --> 01:01:34.096]  Yeah, and it's been going on for four and a half years.
[01:01:34.736 --> 01:01:35.856]  They've actually been doing this.
[01:01:35.897 --> 01:01:41.419]  They have one guy that they grabbed when the Coast Guard was a branch of, you know, civil service.
[01:01:41.459 --> 01:01:45.621]  The reason they're a civil service is because they have to deal with Americans, but it gets much deeper than that.
[01:01:45.641 --> 01:01:48.463]  That's right, because the Posse Comitatus, they were under civil defense.
[01:01:49.361 --> 01:01:50.403]  Right, under DOT.
[01:01:50.603 --> 01:01:52.807]  And that's why they were moved in there in the 60s.
[01:01:53.388 --> 01:02:01.441]  But it's worse because what they're doing now is instead of having people register their boats with the DMV, Department of Motor Vehicles, for the states,
[01:02:02.011 --> 01:02:06.635]  They're stealing that money, getting them to register their boats with Homeland Security, U.S.
[01:02:06.755 --> 01:02:07.396]  Coast Guard.
[01:02:07.416 --> 01:02:12.060]  Well, that's why Homeland Security has now said to go outside the 12-mile mark now.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:19.467]  They're even commandeering fishing boats that are taking tourists out and demanding passports and not to leave the country.
[01:02:19.507 --> 01:02:22.750]  You go through a Homeland Security, no APB, no criminal warrant out.
[01:02:23.091 --> 01:02:26.714]  They just decide if you can leave or even go out past the 12-mile mark.
[01:02:27.423 --> 01:02:28.865]  Well, they're even going and boarding.
[01:02:28.885 --> 01:02:36.134]  They have a branch of the military now boarding American flag, private vessels, tugboats, yachts, sailboats, whatever.
[01:02:36.554 --> 01:02:38.537]  And they're getting people to register.
[01:02:39.184 --> 01:02:43.869]  They're both just like the Department of Motor Vehicles with a branch of the military.
[01:02:43.889 --> 01:02:46.352]  That's like registering your boat with the Navy.
[01:02:46.853 --> 01:02:51.678]  And I'm sorry, the only time that anything like that was ever done was in World War II.
[01:02:51.958 --> 01:02:52.939]  Eric, this is huge.
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.361]  Do you got any articles up about it?
[01:02:54.401 --> 01:02:58.626]  I'll get some of my writers to do a story on it because I'm aware of much of what you said, but not all of it.
[01:02:59.215 --> 01:03:08.141]  Well, actually, and there's two new vessels coming out that are an international class interceptor for the Coast Guard, and the names of these two vessels are named the Bertholt and the Vosch.
[01:03:08.221 --> 01:03:09.182]  Two good German names.
[01:03:09.542 --> 01:03:20.050]  Well, what's happening is, is they are seizing the infrastructure and the intercoastal waterways and now, under Homeland Security, running checkpoints everywhere, searching citizens.
[01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:24.333]  This is just, I went through this a few weeks ago in Galveston.
[01:03:25.113 --> 01:03:26.054]  Give people your website.
[01:03:26.952 --> 01:03:27.672]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:56.809]  A new world order.
[01:03:57.509 --> 01:04:01.730]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:04.611]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:04:05.231 --> 01:04:07.491]  Wasn't their objective to be world domination?
[01:04:08.032 --> 01:04:10.472]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:11.212 --> 01:04:18.554]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:21.556 --> 01:04:26.539]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:30.482]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:30.862 --> 01:04:33.364]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:33.444 --> 01:04:34.405]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:34.425 --> 01:04:35.365]  They're not after money.
[01:04:35.385 --> 01:04:36.446]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:37.387]  They're after time.
[01:04:37.647 --> 01:04:38.347]  That's what I'm using.

[01:06:47.137 --> 01:06:49.018]  I've asked you to join me in this fight against them.
[01:06:49.078 --> 01:06:50.159]  They give us no quarter.
[01:06:50.179 --> 01:06:54.182]  They are coming against us on a thousand fronts.
[01:07:14.108 --> 01:07:16.210]  And millions of people have answered the call.
[01:07:18.231 --> 01:07:20.733]  We're getting into very, very serious times right now.
[01:07:22.134 --> 01:07:28.458]  And I'm asking you out there to redouble your efforts every day and every way to wake your fellow countrymen and women up.
[01:07:29.659 --> 01:07:34.102]  Because we're headed into very, very serious times.
[01:07:36.203 --> 01:07:39.986]  We're going to go back to your calls right now and then I will get into all that news that I just mentioned.
[01:07:40.506 --> 01:07:41.467]  Who's up first here?
[01:07:43.251 --> 01:07:45.152]  Steve in New York, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:07:46.592 --> 01:07:47.672]  Yes, Alex, Steve.
[01:07:47.852 --> 01:07:50.793]  I met you on 9-11 there when you were in town.
[01:07:50.813 --> 01:07:54.674]  I actually have a couple of videos I shot with We Are Change and that you put up.
[01:07:54.834 --> 01:08:07.997]  I just wanted to mention one thing that sometimes we do have some successes here with the New York film permitting issues that we were protesting and stuff.
[01:08:08.017 --> 01:08:09.918]  They finally came out with some changes now.
[01:08:11.039 --> 01:08:15.868]  I've tried to be a lot more favorable, so once in a while we have a small victory in the fight.
[01:08:17.358 --> 01:08:17.818]  That's right.
[01:08:18.059 --> 01:08:25.905]  Bloomberg, in conflict of interest, claiming you can't even have a video camera in the city without paying for a million dollars of insurance, and that camera phones aren't allowed.
[01:08:25.945 --> 01:08:30.709]  But no one's going to go along with that and buy into that, and they've lost so many lawsuits that he was forced to back off.
[01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:32.130]  I mean, that's the good news.
[01:08:32.190 --> 01:08:35.893]  Congress has a 11% approval rating and plunging.
[01:08:36.293 --> 01:08:37.394]  They're totally discredited.
[01:08:37.434 --> 01:08:39.636]  The war, 80% of Americans are against it.
[01:08:40.077 --> 01:08:44.260]  So yes, their whole system is very, very unpopular, and the people are getting wise to it.
[01:08:45.003 --> 01:08:48.645]  And the thing is, like you said before, you know, the first part of movement is to move.
[01:08:48.765 --> 01:08:53.587]  And, you know, even just taking little steps, the baby steps, it's still just one more thing they got to deal with.
[01:08:53.667 --> 01:08:57.629]  You know, it's like you hit them from every angle and things start coming apart.
[01:08:58.589 --> 01:08:59.029]  That's it.
[01:08:59.049 --> 01:09:00.830]  The first thing is to discredit these people.
[01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:01.770]  It's not our government.
[01:09:01.790 --> 01:09:02.371]  It's criminal.
[01:09:03.451 --> 01:09:09.954]  They tell us give up all of our freedoms and liberties for terrorists and they leave our borders completely open and it just doesn't hold water anymore.
[01:09:10.618 --> 01:09:22.029]  And every week I read about them raiding some old man in Indiana or Texas who's got black powder in their gun safe and arresting him and calling him Al Qaeda and saying, oh my gosh, he had 10 guns, we can't believe he had this many.
[01:09:22.049 --> 01:09:23.010]  I mean, I'm sick of it!
[01:09:23.550 --> 01:09:25.192]  I'm sick of them just feeding on us!
[01:09:27.014 --> 01:09:29.496]  Yeah, it just becomes like this growing cycle.
[01:09:29.536 --> 01:09:36.520]  Ever since, you know, from the Clinton administration on up, people blame this administration, but it's been a slow and fidious process for a long time.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.421]  They're following an exact policy.
[01:09:38.441 --> 01:09:43.484]  The policies don't change from Bush, Clinton, Bush, now Clinton probably.
[01:09:43.504 --> 01:09:45.145]  It just continues.
[01:09:45.205 --> 01:09:46.626]  It just continues to roll on.
[01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:57.880]  Yeah, one day you turn me on to the whole concept of Fabian Socialism, which I've never really studied before, but you start seeing how that is, like, permeated into all different aspects of politics.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.121]  Total micromanagement of the people.
[01:10:02.342 --> 01:10:02.943]  Thank you very much.
[01:10:02.983 --> 01:10:04.303]  I won't take up any more of your time today.
[01:10:04.504 --> 01:10:09.446]  We'll be posting another video on the department resolution, so I'll email Aaron that when it gets up.
[01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:10.967]  Okay, thank you, Steve.
[01:10:11.447 --> 01:10:13.048]  Zach in Oregon, you're on the air.
[01:10:15.069 --> 01:10:15.209]  Yes?
[01:10:15.976 --> 01:10:21.141]  I know you're not into a lot of these astrological events and everything, but I think your listeners might be interested to hear about this one.
[01:10:21.642 --> 01:10:25.105]  And that is the Planet Pluto Crossing Galactic Center in early November of this year.
[01:10:25.125 --> 01:10:27.308]  So this event is taking place right now.
[01:10:27.984 --> 01:10:31.485]  Before I make my point, which is actually a prediction, I want your listeners to be open to the idea.
[01:10:31.505 --> 01:10:37.328]  The Galactic Center is billions of light years away in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.
[01:10:38.068 --> 01:10:45.651]  We are on the outer spiral arm, the next to last arm, away from the Galactic Center.
[01:10:46.211 --> 01:10:49.652]  And all this talk about how we're crossing a Galactic Center is not true.
[01:10:49.672 --> 01:10:51.373]  Where'd you get that?
[01:10:51.393 --> 01:10:54.334]  Do you understand that astrology is not astronomy?
[01:10:56.024 --> 01:11:00.326]  Well, yeah, but you also gotta understand that information like this has been suppressed for reasons.
[01:11:00.646 --> 01:11:01.166]  Suppressed?
[01:11:01.246 --> 01:11:05.928]  Okay, sir, I'm telling you that Pluto is not crossing the galactic center.
[01:11:07.349 --> 01:11:07.609]  Alright.
[01:11:07.629 --> 01:11:09.110]  I mean, what does that mean?
[01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:11.591]  Pluto crossing the galactic center?
[01:11:12.571 --> 01:11:21.615]  Well, I mean, something I would like your listeners to understand is that these are not just rocks floating in space, that the position of the planets and their movements actually affect our consciousness on one level or another.
[01:11:22.176 --> 01:11:24.118]  I know it does sound like all new agey and everything.
[01:11:24.138 --> 01:11:33.745]  The only way a planet affects us is when I'm looking at it in the night sky, that the little rods and cones in my retina pick it up.
[01:11:34.566 --> 01:11:43.372]  That's how it's affecting me, is that micron of light going into these incredibly light-sensitive little brain appendages that are my eyeballs.
[01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:44.073]  Right, right.
[01:11:44.593 --> 01:11:50.778]  Well, I mean, to get to the point, what I'm trying to get at is... The gravitational pull, you're saying spiritually they affect us.
[01:11:51.593 --> 01:11:53.834]  Right, and psychologically and everything, too.
[01:11:53.854 --> 01:11:56.095]  I just want to tell you what I'm saying.
[01:11:56.115 --> 01:11:57.156]  I'm not being mean to you.
[01:11:57.376 --> 01:11:58.657]  You just go ahead and make your case.
[01:11:58.677 --> 01:11:59.077]  Go ahead.
[01:11:59.377 --> 01:11:59.597]  All right.
[01:12:00.017 --> 01:12:08.301]  Well, you had Jordan Maxwell on your show about a year ago, and he was talking about that there might be some event in this November of this year, because you were asking him, you know, why the holdup?
[01:12:08.381 --> 01:12:11.723]  Why is the elite, you know, not moving with their whole plan and everything like that?
[01:12:12.083 --> 01:12:14.865]  And he was saying that this November is looking like a very good time.
[01:12:15.285 --> 01:12:21.308]  You know, I can't be sure, but I think he might be talking about this event, because a man by the name of Michael Tarstan, who gets into a lot of this
[01:12:21.835 --> 01:12:28.117]  Uh, discussion about the toxicity of man and the evil within man and everything like that, and it's all charted out in the stars and everything like that.
[01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:32.558]  He also follows, uh, Jordan Maxwell's work with the Sons of the Serpents and everything, and he talks about all this.
[01:12:32.898 --> 01:12:49.003]  But basically what my point is, that I think this event will generate a lot of fear in the minds of the people, which the oligarchy will take full advantage of and launch another false flag terror attack on the United States, because I know you've been saying it must be coming, and I know we're on the razor's edge pretty close, so I think that they might actually use this event to pull off their plan.
[01:12:52.595 --> 01:12:54.876]  Now, scientifically, what is Pluto doing?
[01:12:54.896 --> 01:12:59.878]  Alright, well, Pluto, you've got to understand that the planets actually represent these certain archetypes.
[01:12:59.938 --> 01:13:07.001]  Now, Pluto represents deconstruction and radical change, and is also very in touch with the human psyche and what Freud called the shadow self.
[01:13:07.542 --> 01:13:15.525]  Now, what it's supposed to be doing is, it's kind of like what Michael Perseus puts it, it's like, you know how the light shines through your window at a certain angle and you can see all the particles in the air?
[01:13:15.965 --> 01:13:17.026]  That's what Pluto's going to do.
[01:13:17.046 --> 01:13:19.527]  It's going to show us all the toxicity which is inside the world.
[01:13:19.969 --> 01:13:27.814]  And it also does, actually, something which is also pretty interesting, because it's also crossing into Capricorn, which is the sign of order and government.
[01:13:28.114 --> 01:13:37.360]  So when you got Pluto, the planet which is representing deconstruction and radical change, and it's moving into the sign of order and government, you're going to see a lot of explosions.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.460]  Do you know what Pluto is?
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.422]  Do you know what Pluto is the god of?
[01:13:42.483 --> 01:13:43.343]  What is Pluto the god of?
[01:13:44.044 --> 01:13:44.564]  You don't know?
[01:13:44.584 --> 01:13:47.206]  Well, you're just asking the question.
[01:13:47.286 --> 01:13:48.927]  It's the Roman god of the underworld.
[01:13:49.622 --> 01:13:49.862]  Okay.
[01:13:51.983 --> 01:13:53.124]  The ruling god of the underworld?
[01:13:53.404 --> 01:13:55.945]  The Roman God of Hell!
[01:13:55.965 --> 01:13:58.306]  Okay, I get you now.
[01:14:01.867 --> 01:14:03.128]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:14:03.668 --> 01:14:04.589]  I really do, man.
[01:14:04.809 --> 01:14:05.489]  I really do.
[01:14:07.770 --> 01:14:12.652]  I thought people were waking up right now because we spread the word about the New World Order and people made copies of films.
[01:14:12.692 --> 01:14:14.713]  We've done thousands of radio shows.
[01:14:15.854 --> 01:14:16.554]  I didn't know that
[01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:21.171]  Everything was going to change in November because Pluto was crossing the galactic center.
[01:14:22.351 --> 01:14:23.172]  Which isn't even true.
[01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:27.733]  Look, I've had enough of all the snake-men talk.
[01:14:27.853 --> 01:14:29.533]  I've had enough of UFO stuff.
[01:14:30.133 --> 01:14:31.134]  I don't cover that.
[01:14:32.114 --> 01:14:34.595]  PD'd and half of our movement spends their time on it.
[01:14:34.755 --> 01:14:35.335]  Because it's easy.
[01:14:35.355 --> 01:14:36.675]  You don't have to actually read any bills.
[01:14:37.395 --> 01:14:40.056]  Let's talk about the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:14:41.062 --> 01:14:45.905]  Saying the government is prepared for martial law and revolt against the American people.
[01:14:46.346 --> 01:14:48.167]  It says they're worried about us revolting.
[01:14:48.447 --> 01:14:50.088]  They're worried about us standing up.
[01:14:50.428 --> 01:14:54.891]  It's for us, the military, to suppress us in the defense package for this year.
[01:14:58.054 --> 01:15:01.116]  Now I don't know if they're going to go ahead and pull it, but they're certainly lined up.
[01:15:01.556 --> 01:15:07.340]  Bush in May of this year declares himself dictator above Congress, and then a few months later goes to Montebello, Canada,
[01:15:07.975 --> 01:15:11.376]  For the SPP, it openly says the UN is over us during emergencies.
[01:15:11.396 --> 01:15:12.437]  That's mainstream news.
[01:15:12.817 --> 01:15:16.558]  Huge, unbelievable, earth-shaking, incredible events happening.
[01:15:18.979 --> 01:15:36.885]  We have bills passing, going out of the House, 400-plus votes, 90-plus percent of the House voting, going to the Senate to set up a 10-member board that will decide what books to ban and what websites to ban and what, they say, ideas contribute to homegrown terrorists, and it literally says prevention, pre-crime.
[01:15:37.887 --> 01:15:39.128]  You think that's an American thing?
[01:15:39.408 --> 01:15:40.088]  Pre-crime?
[01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:44.571]  Burning books, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:44.651 --> 01:15:45.711]  It actually says it.
[01:15:46.992 --> 01:15:47.912]  It's all happening.
[01:15:47.932 --> 01:15:51.214]  We're being raped by the international bankers.
[01:15:51.594 --> 01:15:53.656]  They're raping the dollar, raping the country.
[01:15:54.276 --> 01:15:56.177]  Doubling the number of police every few years.
[01:15:56.966 --> 01:16:06.589]  Just running all over the place, sitting there with their radar guns, ignoring the illegal aliens who don't have stickers, or, you know, they don't want the hoopties, they want the middle class people who've got the money, who pay like cattle.
[01:16:07.410 --> 01:16:10.071]  Again, it just illustrates, it's all a sick joke.
[01:16:10.111 --> 01:16:15.352]  You as a citizen go in with one form of ID, no ID, they tell you, get out of the bank.
[01:16:15.813 --> 01:16:18.393]  The illegal aliens, yes sir, you're in the front of the line.
[01:16:18.714 --> 01:16:21.475]  My illustration is, this is a criminal government.
[01:16:22.775 --> 01:16:23.995]  Period.
[01:16:24.436 --> 01:16:25.576]  Period.
[01:16:28.789 --> 01:16:39.418]  And I'm tired of going on talk shows or being attacked by the national news for all the things that, just because the mainstream media spins and lies, doesn't mean that everything alternative media is saying is true.
[01:16:40.239 --> 01:16:42.060]  Now, I don't believe in astrology.
[01:16:43.601 --> 01:16:48.225]  Astrology is based on the Earth being the center of the universe.
[01:16:50.347 --> 01:16:52.809]  The Earth is not the center of the universe.
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:17:01.687]  And I know it's fun to get up and read the horoscope and talk about Pluto and the house of Mars and Saturn and the Keebler Elves.
[01:17:02.248 --> 01:17:04.690]  This is not the broadcast for that.
[01:17:05.191 --> 01:17:06.552]  This is not where I do that.
[01:17:06.833 --> 01:17:10.276]  Now listen, you're welcome to call in about it, but you're going to get what I think about it.
[01:17:11.898 --> 01:17:14.480]  Okay, I deal with real issues.
[01:17:14.601 --> 01:17:17.784]  I mean, there are idiots on the internet
[01:17:18.542 --> 01:17:26.848]  Who sit there and take John Edwards or myself or anybody else when we look up during TV interviews and there's two cameras, I mean two lights.
[01:17:26.888 --> 01:17:28.049]  That's how you set lights.
[01:17:30.450 --> 01:17:33.993]  And the reflection of those is on your eye.
[01:17:34.033 --> 01:17:35.974]  You can even see in these videos the lights.
[01:17:36.214 --> 01:17:37.475]  That's when you look up at the lights.
[01:17:37.915 --> 01:17:40.277]  And they go, look, it's reptoid eyes!
[01:17:40.417 --> 01:17:42.358]  I mean, give me a break!
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:47.542]  Stop taking the LSD and get serious!
[01:17:48.562 --> 01:17:48.962]  Okay?
[01:17:50.043 --> 01:17:52.585]  It's time to stop the childish mental illness.
[01:17:54.586 --> 01:17:56.127]  It's time to get serious.
[01:17:56.688 --> 01:18:04.694]  We need you guys, instead of ninnying and infighting with each other, whether the Tooth Fairy, the Vatican, or the Jews run everything, and start just fighting the New World Order.
[01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:09.377]  And we need to stop worrying about if it's the Reptoids or the Possum People.
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:15.443]  We desperately need to get focused on real issues.
[01:18:15.963 --> 01:18:22.386]  Houston Chronicle and other papers reported they have built FEMA camps for the American people.
[01:18:23.607 --> 01:18:28.729]  I have videotaped the Marines training to take your children from you and to take you to camps.
[01:18:29.289 --> 01:18:29.830]  All of us.
[01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:36.333]  Major News now admits years after we broke it, they've trained the preachers to tell you to submit.
[01:18:37.142 --> 01:18:41.607]  We have literal Nazi-slash-communists wanting to take over.
[01:18:42.168 --> 01:18:47.774]  We've got to stop them and ring the alarm bell and stop babbling about Pluto.
[01:18:52.952 --> 01:18:53.932]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:18:54.012 --> 01:18:58.793]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:18:58.973 --> 01:19:06.775]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:19:07.035 --> 01:19:12.396]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:19:12.616 --> 01:19:19.578]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:19:19.898 --> 01:19:25.221]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:19:25.501 --> 01:19:30.204]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:19:30.564 --> 01:19:38.148]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:19:38.488 --> 01:19:44.734]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:19:45.054 --> 01:19:46.256]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:46.376 --> 01:19:49.819]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[01:20:52.461 --> 01:20:53.021]  Hey Emily!
[01:20:53.282 --> 01:20:54.142]  Wow, you look great!
[01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:55.183]  I feel great!
[01:20:55.423 --> 01:20:57.204]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:20:57.505 --> 01:20:57.805]  Really?
[01:20:58.025 --> 01:20:58.445]  What is it?
[01:20:58.645 --> 01:20:59.126]  How does it work?
[01:20:59.306 --> 01:21:05.910]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:08.352]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:21:08.552 --> 01:21:13.856]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:21:14.176 --> 01:21:14.677]  That's it?
[01:21:14.957 --> 01:21:16.479]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:21:16.739 --> 01:21:17.460]  It is easy.
[01:21:17.661 --> 01:21:24.369]  Plus the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:21:24.649 --> 01:21:26.171]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:21:26.472 --> 01:21:27.193]  That's amazing!
[01:21:27.573 --> 01:21:32.940]  And the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:33.601]  Wow!
[01:21:33.801 --> 01:21:34.902]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[01:21:35.202 --> 01:21:38.026]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:41.310]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.

[01:21:45.915 --> 01:21:46.195]  Call today.
[01:21:52.691 --> 01:21:56.012]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN Financial Bulletin.
[01:21:56.332 --> 01:22:01.334]  Have you ever wanted to make a lot of extra cash in a way that requires very little money to get started?
[01:22:01.734 --> 01:22:06.896]  If so, and you have a high-speed internet connection, this may well be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:22:07.116 --> 01:22:07.696]  Here's why.
[01:22:07.896 --> 01:22:15.879]  You can now get a free DVD that reveals how to make more money than any sane person can possibly spend, and do it while working part-time at home.
[01:22:16.259 --> 01:22:16.639]  I don't know.
[01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:36.765]  We're good to go.
[01:23:03.797 --> 01:23:04.939]  We're good to go.
[01:23:19.397 --> 01:23:24.359]  In Greek, Hades is the god of the underworld.
[01:23:24.519 --> 01:23:26.199]  In Roman, it is Pluto.
[01:23:26.239 --> 01:23:34.322]  It's interesting that of course Satan's main servant is Charon, and that's the name of Pluto's largest
[01:23:48.713 --> 01:23:49.213]  Satellite?
[01:23:49.454 --> 01:23:49.814]  Moon?
[01:23:53.156 --> 01:23:55.197]  Alright, and I'm not trying to be mean to you, sir.
[01:23:55.217 --> 01:23:57.739]  I know it's fun to be into astrology and cute and everything.
[01:23:57.839 --> 01:24:00.221]  It's just that I happened to research it and looked into it.
[01:24:01.361 --> 01:24:05.164]  And it's just no end to the chicanery that goes on with it.
[01:24:05.844 --> 01:24:10.067]  And believe me, the gypsies and people out at the roadside shacks doing it don't believe in it either.
[01:24:10.087 --> 01:24:11.068]  They're just conning you.
[01:24:13.118 --> 01:24:18.642]  And so I just I'm begging my listeners to just please get into real issues.
[01:24:18.742 --> 01:24:19.302]  I'm begging you.
[01:24:19.322 --> 01:24:22.524]  We need every man and woman to focus on stuff we can prove.
[01:24:22.584 --> 01:24:24.005]  I mean, let's just say it's real.
[01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:26.006]  I don't believe it, but whatever.
[01:24:26.707 --> 01:24:28.788]  The point is, we got to deal with stuff we can prove.
[01:24:31.167 --> 01:24:34.651]  Let's go to Sam in Utah, then Tony, Dan, Jimmy, Scott and others.
[01:24:34.731 --> 01:24:35.612]  Sam, you're on the air.
[01:24:35.632 --> 01:24:36.834]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:24:37.014 --> 01:24:37.274]  Good.
[01:24:37.815 --> 01:24:39.677]  Hey, I've got several things I want to talk about.
[01:24:39.697 --> 01:24:42.981]  I need to tell you a little bit about who I am before I do so you'll know what I mean.
[01:24:43.481 --> 01:24:48.227]  My name is Sam Bushman and I make a living as a talk show host and as a mortgage broker.
[01:24:48.883 --> 01:24:52.044]  And I also run a couple of radio stations as a general manager as well.
[01:24:52.524 --> 01:24:56.304]  But the reason I tell you that is because there's kind of two levels of people.
[01:24:56.324 --> 01:25:00.185]  There's a lot of us who are talk show hosts who do a good job and who tell a lot of the truth.
[01:25:00.885 --> 01:25:02.545]  We're not bought off by the new world order.
[01:25:03.085 --> 01:25:09.046]  I've known about your show for a long time, but in the past I've just heard what I've heard about it, never researched it myself well enough.
[01:25:09.947 --> 01:25:11.827]  And I just thought, oh, Alex is too hardcore.
[01:25:11.887 --> 01:25:14.427]  Alex, you know, makes a lot of claims.
[01:25:14.447 --> 01:25:15.448]  They're hard to back up.
[01:25:15.508 --> 01:25:18.048]  But that's because those who don't do their research don't know.
[01:25:19.503 --> 01:25:22.807]  As of late, probably the last two months, I have listened to your show quite a bit.
[01:25:23.587 --> 01:25:25.830]  And I have researched a lot of the claims you make.
[01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:28.352]  And indeed, they are factual.
[01:25:29.153 --> 01:25:30.915]  Indeed, you are speaking the truth.
[01:25:31.915 --> 01:25:35.038]  And I just wanted to come on the radio and tell everybody about that, because it's interesting.
[01:25:35.098 --> 01:25:37.360]  And first you want to disclaim it and say it's just too radical.
[01:25:37.721 --> 01:25:42.886]  And my response is, as you say, do the research, and you'll absolutely find out the truth.
[01:25:43.266 --> 01:25:52.275]  Well Sam, I appreciate those kind words, because I don't like coming on air and saying the things I'm saying, but morally, I've got to tell people the truth.
[01:25:53.493 --> 01:25:58.099]  I've got to tell people the NRA was founded for and been involved in gun control since the start.
[01:25:58.139 --> 01:25:58.820]  I've got to tell them.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:02.966]  By the way, I worked with Larry Pratt, worked on that in detail, and every bit of that is absolutely factual.
[01:26:03.727 --> 01:26:07.853]  And I've got to tell people that Fox and Rupert Murdoch are behind Hillary.
[01:26:08.193 --> 01:26:09.956]  I mean, I know it sounds crazy, but it's true!
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:13.302]  You know, I thought Glenn Beck was a reasonably good guy.
[01:26:13.322 --> 01:26:27.916]  I've been working with David Von, er, yeah, Von Kleist on that, and Joyce Reilly and those guys, and I've seen the interview that Glenn Beck did his best to assassinate him for talking about 9-1-1 truth and all that kind of stuff, just showing where Glenn Beck really stands.
[01:26:28.497 --> 01:26:32.040]  All you've got to do is spend the time to do the research, and I'm just telling people, don't dismiss it.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.601]  Find out for yourself.
[01:26:33.641 --> 01:26:35.303]  There's no greater convert than to do that.
[01:26:36.653 --> 01:26:37.334]  I hear you, my friend.
[01:26:37.374 --> 01:26:37.934]  Anything else?
[01:26:38.214 --> 01:26:39.035]  A couple of other things.
[01:26:39.155 --> 01:26:43.017]  One, I mentioned I was a mortgage broker as well, and I just want to talk about the dollar falling.
[01:26:43.597 --> 01:26:44.698]  Oil skyrocketing.
[01:26:45.038 --> 01:26:46.719]  Mortgages melting down around the world.
[01:26:46.739 --> 01:26:49.521]  They want you to believe it's a subprime problem with subprime mortgages?
[01:26:50.254 --> 01:26:51.535]  They're lying, it's not the truth.
[01:26:52.195 --> 01:26:58.860]  Sure, sometimes mortgages are affected, but the fact is, it's the Federal Reserve and the manipulation of the currency that's at the heart of it.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:04.163]  The bottom line is, if there was gold and silver, honest money if you will, they wouldn't be able to manipulate this stuff.
[01:27:04.643 --> 01:27:11.147]  They wouldn't be able to prop up values of homes like they do, play games with money in appraisal amounts and everything else.
[01:27:11.488 --> 01:27:18.312]  The bottom line is, you can talk about the symptoms, there's all kinds of symptoms, but the truth is, it's dishonest money at the heart of it all.
[01:27:20.205 --> 01:27:28.133]  Well, that's it, and frankly, with the type of inflation we're seeing, housing should actually still be going up, but they are artificially, and they said this,
[01:27:28.979 --> 01:27:30.500]  Popping it by design.
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:39.343]  It's all the manipulations at the heart of it and nothing will make sense due to true based economics because it's all manipulation on their part.
[01:27:39.783 --> 01:27:48.687]  Well that's why we may see housing really drop and then go back up later because if the dollar is evaluated even more then you would imagine that housing would have to go up.
[01:27:48.987 --> 01:27:53.889]  But if nobody has money to buy housing or other real estate then it may stay down.
[01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:57.971]  I really don't know exactly what's going to happen but any
[01:27:58.837 --> 01:28:00.537]  Any direction it takes, it's all bad.
[01:28:01.458 --> 01:28:02.498]  All I can tell you is this.
[01:28:02.598 --> 01:28:04.078]  It doesn't matter if it goes down or up.
[01:28:04.118 --> 01:28:12.501]  What will happen since they're at the center of control of this, with their money manipulation, is they will fleece the American people of their wealth in real estate, no matter what.
[01:28:12.601 --> 01:28:15.621]  If it goes up or down, their goal is to fleece us of our wealth.
[01:28:17.222 --> 01:28:18.602]  Well, good to hear from you, Sam.
[01:28:19.042 --> 01:28:19.602]  Take care.
[01:28:20.163 --> 01:28:21.063]  Run a couple stations.
[01:28:21.123 --> 01:28:21.663]  Put me on.
[01:28:22.877 --> 01:28:29.340]  We'll come back and talk to Tony, Dan, Jimmy, Scott, and then I'm going to get into a bunch of news on the global tax.
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:35.323]  Oh yeah, on top of this world recession slash depression, they've got a whole new taxing system for you.
[01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:37.924]  Even more to put on the back of the little donkey.
[01:28:38.304 --> 01:28:38.985]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.407 --> 01:28:44.387]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.807 --> 01:28:46.428]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.329 --> 01:28:50.030]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.613 --> 01:28:56.294]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:28:56.594 --> 01:28:58.654]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:28:58.874 --> 01:29:01.395]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:29:01.855 --> 01:29:06.216]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[01:29:06.336 --> 01:29:06.936]  Here's why.
[01:29:07.316 --> 01:29:13.578]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:29:13.858 --> 01:29:20.179]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[01:29:20.479 --> 01:29:24.202]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:29:24.422 --> 01:29:28.665]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:29:29.125 --> 01:29:36.290]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:39.134]  Get control, get relief, get some sleep!
[01:29:39.434 --> 01:29:40.455]  Go to www.outand90.com.
[01:29:40.475 --> 01:29:41.397]  That's www.outand90.com.
[01:29:41.517 --> 01:29:41.978]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:42.218 --> 01:29:42.458]  That's 877-327-0365.

[01:30:58.524 --> 01:31:03.089]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:31:03.469 --> 01:31:06.092]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:31:06.612 --> 01:31:13.299]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:31:13.759 --> 01:31:18.982]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:31:19.442 --> 01:31:21.083]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:31:21.603 --> 01:31:24.885]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:31:25.445 --> 01:31:28.807]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[01:31:28.847 --> 01:31:35.830]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.

[01:32:10.985 --> 01:32:13.807]  Tony in Minnesota, thanks for holding your on the air, welcome.
[01:32:15.968 --> 01:32:16.829]  Hey Alex.
[01:32:16.889 --> 01:32:17.229]  Hi.
[01:32:17.389 --> 01:32:20.831]  Hey, I just wanted to make a request.
[01:32:20.931 --> 01:32:24.614]  I want to, if you can have better guests on the air, or more guests.
[01:32:24.854 --> 01:32:29.777]  You know, you used to have, like six months ago, you used to have like the Luce James guy, and King Jones.
[01:32:29.837 --> 01:32:32.078]  They're just, we're going to need to have them back on.
[01:32:33.119 --> 01:32:36.361]  Okay, well since you're asking me to do stuff, will you call in on a better phone next time?
[01:32:38.254 --> 01:32:39.855]  Or talk that into your receiver.
[01:32:40.335 --> 01:32:41.295]  Yeah.
[01:32:41.395 --> 01:32:48.999]  Listen, we had the Loose Change guys on last Monday for an hour, and we have 9-11 guests on all the time.
[01:32:50.619 --> 01:32:57.482]  But you can always go to the PrisonPlanet.com message board in the guest suggestion area and tell us who you'd like to hear on the show.
[01:32:57.722 --> 01:33:03.865]  Any points about the economy, news, the war, any issues you're calling in about, or just you calling in to give me a tip?
[01:33:08.095 --> 01:33:08.976]  I can't understand you.
[01:33:09.016 --> 01:33:10.076]  I'm gonna let you go.
[01:33:10.577 --> 01:33:11.757]  I'm sorry, Tony.
[01:33:11.857 --> 01:33:13.939]  I just can't make out what you're saying.
[01:33:13.979 --> 01:33:14.859]  I made out the first part.
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:16.180]  Dan in New York.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:16.821]  You're on the air.
[01:33:16.861 --> 01:33:17.541]  Go ahead, Dan.
[01:33:18.382 --> 01:33:18.922]  Hey, Alex.
[01:33:19.002 --> 01:33:20.083]  It's an honor and a pleasure.
[01:33:21.304 --> 01:33:28.168]  Just curious, have you seen this new video that's number one on Google 100 called Hillary Uncensored Banned by the Media?
[01:33:28.328 --> 01:33:34.553]  Yeah, we linked to that with her and all the campaign contributions and running scams and all those recordings of her.
[01:33:35.797 --> 01:33:46.465]  Frankly, that's nothing compared to Pardongate and the Chinese Generals and Whitewater and the Savings and Loan and the Rose Law Firm.
[01:33:47.266 --> 01:33:50.668]  That woman is just a criminal from day one.
[01:33:50.688 --> 01:33:51.989]  She's just an absolute demon.
[01:33:52.369 --> 01:33:58.654]  But yeah, I actually did watch the 14-minute video, I guess on Monday, and we posted it, I think, Tuesday.
[01:33:59.492 --> 01:34:01.114]  Okay, because I didn't see the posting.
[01:34:01.134 --> 01:34:13.110]  Yeah, I mean, our criminality goes beyond numbers, but I just thought this was a nice one to just show all these Hillary supporters out there that there's an actual case pending.
[01:34:14.372 --> 01:34:21.233]  Yeah, sometimes it's hard for them to believe and get into all the Chinese General stuff, but, you know, here you got... Believe it!
[01:34:21.273 --> 01:34:23.854]  I mean, the Chinese General stuff was all over the news.
[01:34:24.794 --> 01:34:33.376]  And then Treasury Secretary Ron Brown said he was going to blow the whistle, and then his plane blew up, and the Air Force coroners were saying they shot everybody in the head.
[01:34:33.856 --> 01:34:39.077]  They had special ops on the aircraft, they shot everybody in the head, blew the door, and he lowed or high-lowed out of there.
[01:34:39.877 --> 01:34:43.459]  And, uh, that's what the investigators said on the ground, and they all got killed.
[01:34:43.499 --> 01:34:44.479]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:34:44.499 --> 01:34:45.420]  These people never end.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:46.600]  Yeah, I know.
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:47.241]  They're pure evil.
[01:34:47.561 --> 01:34:48.301]  Uh, one last thing.
[01:34:48.341 --> 01:34:51.743]  Hey, um, if you want to check out a good song, I think you'd be interested.
[01:34:51.783 --> 01:34:55.264]  You should check out, uh, Pat Benatar, and the name of the song is Invincible.
[01:34:55.765 --> 01:34:56.465]  It's from 1985.
[01:34:56.525 --> 01:34:58.086]  I think you'll, uh, love the lyrics.
[01:34:58.806 --> 01:34:59.767]  Pat Benatar.
[01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:01.367]  I'll start playing some Pat Benatar.
[01:35:01.847 --> 01:35:03.308]  Yeah, just try to check it out.
[01:35:03.328 --> 01:35:05.149]  I think you'll really, really dig the lyrics.
[01:35:05.209 --> 01:35:07.070]  It's sort of appropriate for what's going on today.
[01:35:07.777 --> 01:35:09.079]  Alright Alex, take care.
[01:35:09.139 --> 01:35:10.361]  Thanks a lot for everything you're doing.
[01:35:10.501 --> 01:35:11.723]  Thank you Dan for calling.
[01:35:12.685 --> 01:35:14.147]  Jimmy in Louisiana.
[01:35:14.167 --> 01:35:14.688]  You're on the air.
[01:35:14.708 --> 01:35:15.129]  Go ahead.
[01:35:15.149 --> 01:35:16.971]  Hey, how's it going Alex?
[01:35:16.991 --> 01:35:17.332]  Good sir.
[01:35:18.794 --> 01:35:21.338]  I've been reading up on this guy named John Negroponte.
[01:35:21.378 --> 01:35:22.180]  Have you ever heard of him?
[01:35:22.845 --> 01:35:30.952]  Yes, he's the Undersecretary of State, and he's been assigned to the head of Iraq operations, and he ran the death squads in Latin America.
[01:35:31.313 --> 01:35:48.008]  He's brought over more than 20,000 former members and commanders of the death squads, we broke that here before it was actually in mainstream news, to Iraq, and he was the head of intelligence, the intelligence czar before that, and he is just, again, unbelievably wicked henchman.
[01:35:48.650 --> 01:35:53.471]  I agree, and it just goes to show the hypocrisy of the United States when it comes to terrorism, for real.
[01:35:53.491 --> 01:35:55.592]  If you ask me, do you agree with that?
[01:35:57.112 --> 01:36:01.513]  It's clear the CIA staged bombings to blame it on their political enemies in Latin America.
[01:36:02.153 --> 01:36:10.035]  Yeah, we, uh, it seems like these politicians just cannot stop talking about terrorism whenever their henchmen are committing it every single day.
[01:36:15.333 --> 01:36:16.633]  Would your friend like to get on air?
[01:36:17.114 --> 01:36:19.334]  Yeah, that's what I was just wondering, too, Alex.
[01:36:19.634 --> 01:36:21.635]  I might just throw him out of the room for a second.
[01:36:22.555 --> 01:36:26.396]  Anyway, man, that's all I really have to say, man.
[01:36:26.416 --> 01:36:32.818]  The United States is a really hypocritical country, and I think when we're talking about it, it might not be enough anymore.
[01:36:34.098 --> 01:36:34.959]  I hear you, my friend.
[01:36:34.979 --> 01:36:40.700]  You know, Americans have become decadent, and their souls have become fat and blubbery.
[01:36:42.281 --> 01:36:42.581]  I agree.
[01:36:43.668 --> 01:36:44.989]  It really needs to happen.
[01:36:45.009 --> 01:36:46.170]  The breaking point is soon.
[01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:49.532]  I appreciate your call, Jimmy.
[01:36:50.673 --> 01:36:58.177]  The problem here is that we think that we can be wicked and do bad things in the world and it won't come home.
[01:37:00.759 --> 01:37:03.540]  That torture's cute and false flag terror's cute.
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:06.722]  I mean, I've seen neocons admit that our government staged terror attacks in other countries.
[01:37:06.742 --> 01:37:07.943]  I say, well, that's just how we win!
[01:37:09.542 --> 01:37:16.784]  Well, you don't think these operators are going to come back here and set up shop with mercenaries and black ops squads and assassination death squads in control?
[01:37:18.605 --> 01:37:28.248]  Our government for five years has been publicly running Las Vectas Mexican paramilitary to do assassinations from as far north as Chicago, Illinois to right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:37:28.268 --> 01:37:31.009]  They can even have car bombs go off in Dallas and kill people.
[01:37:31.529 --> 01:37:32.810]  It's just a footnote in the paper.
[01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:35.571]  See, real terrorism is kept quiet.
[01:37:36.511 --> 01:37:39.032]  And then the media... In fact, let's just cover this now.
[01:37:40.552 --> 01:37:42.213]  Let me dig it out of my stack here.
[01:37:42.253 --> 01:37:46.036]  This is the top story, up on PrisonPlanet.com today.
[01:37:48.457 --> 01:37:54.421]  Memos prove Rumsfeld directed psychological terror campaign.
[01:37:56.022 --> 01:38:03.867]  Hyping climate of fear, threat of violence to achieve political objections is the very definition of terrorism.
[01:38:04.688 --> 01:38:07.729]  Paul Joseph Watson, PrisonPlanet.com, November 2nd, 2007.
[01:38:12.643 --> 01:38:16.925]  New Pentagon memos released by the Washington Post prove that ex-Defense U.S.
[01:38:16.945 --> 01:38:32.571]  Secretary Donald Rumsfeld directed a psychological warfare campaign of terror against the American people in order to achieve political objectives, making Rumsfeld himself a terrorist according to the very definition of the term.
[01:38:34.512 --> 01:38:35.352]  Do what we say.
[01:38:35.452 --> 01:38:37.793]  Give up your rights or terrorists are going to kill you.
[01:38:38.614 --> 01:38:39.354]  That's terrorism.
[01:38:40.763 --> 01:38:51.009]  Donald Rumsfeld, the former United States Defense Secretary, tried to maintain an atmosphere of fear in America as part of the War on Propaganda campaign.
[01:38:51.469 --> 01:38:54.611]  A series of leaked memos has shown, reports the London Telegraph.
[01:38:55.152 --> 01:39:04.417]  In an April 2006 memo, Rumsfeld encouraged Pentagon officials to keep elevating the threat and talk about Somalia, the Philippines, etc.
[01:39:04.997 --> 01:39:09.160]  Make the American people realize they are surrounded in the world by violent extremists.
[01:39:11.485 --> 01:39:12.666]  And it continues.
[01:39:14.028 --> 01:39:20.074]  When you actually study all these men, these were hardcore ground operatives in black ops worldwide.
[01:39:20.594 --> 01:39:24.878]  These are seasoned, seasoned hardcore killers.
[01:39:25.799 --> 01:39:28.101]  And they want the power, and they said, why not take over?
[01:39:28.121 --> 01:39:32.205]  And they got the big banks full backing, and they are serious.
[01:39:33.026 --> 01:39:35.749]  I just learned that Marcus Wolf, the former head of the SCSI,
[01:39:36.428 --> 01:39:43.955]  Who was hired in 2003 and paid over a million dollars to consult the federal government on the setting up of the Tattletail Society.
[01:39:45.977 --> 01:39:47.418]  And now you see it every day in the news.
[01:39:47.558 --> 01:40:01.091]  FBI in a rural area pays for, you know, dinner to have locals come and tells them they need them to fight terror and spy on neighbors and report dossiers and look for marijuana plants and fight crime and does somebody have black powder and see there's no real terrorist.
[01:40:02.432 --> 01:40:12.595]  In Illinois, or Indiana, or Missouri, or California, you know, it's just, so it's just Bureau of Land Management, Forestry Service, citizens literally creeping around watching you.
[01:40:13.435 --> 01:40:31.401]  Just, they've recruited 400 plus thousand truckers, now they want to expand it to millions, in the Eagle Eyes program to look for terrorists, but then they say, oh, and guns, or people spanking their children, or just anything, just call police, just spies everywhere.
[01:40:33.946 --> 01:40:35.067]  Marcus Wolfe.
[01:40:36.288 --> 01:40:38.689]  Marcus Wolfe, the Stasi.
[01:40:39.330 --> 01:40:45.954]  But in a world where Americans can't find Iran on a map, or can't find the US on a map, they say Stasi Schmazi.
[01:40:46.075 --> 01:40:51.018]  Is that some kind of, you know, new Austrian dish?
[01:40:52.359 --> 01:41:00.021]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it is the recognized, most wicked, most evil, surveilled society in world history, East Germany.
[01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:07.863]  The merger of the Nazi-slash-GRU-KGB system.
[01:41:12.544 --> 01:41:16.165]  And I just, it makes me real to realize they hired Primakov.
[01:41:16.966 --> 01:41:18.366]  I mean, they're hiring
[01:41:19.264 --> 01:41:22.768]  Hundreds of thousands of aggravated felons for the National Guard and the military.
[01:41:22.808 --> 01:41:24.510]  I told you that years ago, now it's mainstream news.
[01:41:25.110 --> 01:41:27.193]  They're hiring illegal aliens.
[01:41:27.253 --> 01:41:40.747]  I mean, all of that, each one of those is red alert, red flags, emergency insanity, open martial law discussions, former KGB chiefs, former Stasi chiefs on how to set it up, and then they do it!
[01:41:47.376 --> 01:41:51.217]  You better be afraid of not fighting them and speaking out against them.
[01:41:51.237 --> 01:41:52.877]  The good news is they're totally discredited.
[01:41:52.917 --> 01:41:54.177]  The people are finding out now.
[01:41:57.218 --> 01:42:00.719]  This is not war-torn, destroyed East Germany, where you could set this up.
[01:42:00.739 --> 01:42:05.580]  This is not the poor, enslaved Russians under Czarist control and handed over to the commies.
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:11.261]  This is not feudal China becoming communism or feudal Japan.
[01:42:11.301 --> 01:42:12.741]  This is the United States.
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:21.143]  And there is a large segment, a huge growing remnant, who know exactly what's going on.
[01:42:21.443 --> 01:42:35.350]  And I assure the New World Order, you're trying to do this by increments, but you move too quickly, and I just want to speak to the police and military and others, for heaven's sake, I beg you, prostrate on my knees.
[01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:38.051]  I am bowing and kneeling and literally
[01:42:38.957 --> 01:42:40.719]  Literally kissing your feet humbly.
[01:42:41.119 --> 01:42:43.521]  I will wash your feet if you would just wake up.
[01:42:43.721 --> 01:42:57.592]  I will, I mean literally, at a spiritual level, I want you to know I am on my knees humbly begging you to be human beings, begging you to learn a little bit about history, begging you to look into my claims, begging you!
[01:42:58.392 --> 01:43:04.277]  These people that are in control of our country, absolute documented fact, mainstream history books,
[01:43:06.955 --> 01:43:07.695]  Funded Lenin.
[01:43:07.756 --> 01:43:08.656]  Funded Stalin.
[01:43:08.696 --> 01:43:09.396]  Funded Hitler.
[01:43:09.456 --> 01:43:10.857]  Put Mao into power.
[01:43:10.877 --> 01:43:11.938]  It's now on the History Channel.
[01:43:13.638 --> 01:43:16.740]  They are the most... They are... They love evil.
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:17.820]  They love to kill.
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:19.301]  They want to set up a police state.
[01:43:19.621 --> 01:43:20.742]  They want to stage terror.
[01:43:21.102 --> 01:43:23.023]  They want to arrest millions of people.
[01:43:23.103 --> 01:43:24.604]  They want to kill en masse.
[01:43:25.884 --> 01:43:27.505]  We've got to say no.
[01:43:27.645 --> 01:43:30.126]  Please listen to me.
[01:43:30.207 --> 01:43:33.108]  This is life and death.
[01:43:35.146 --> 01:43:37.368]  These folks do not play games.
[01:43:37.408 --> 01:43:39.450]  They will purge this country from one to the other.
[01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:41.792]  Do you know why it's called Night of the Long Knives?
[01:43:42.513 --> 01:43:45.015]  You ever heard that term?
[01:43:47.217 --> 01:44:01.429]  Jus Rome, head of the SA, the Brownshirts, several million strong, that stormed to power and brought Hitler to power after the staged terror attack, brought him to full furorship, a few months after the
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:11.465]  February 27th, Rash Tag Fire, they had the Night of the Long Knives, and it wasn't Gypsies or Jews or Christians that didn't go along.
[01:44:13.125 --> 01:44:14.486]  Protestants that didn't go along.
[01:44:15.066 --> 01:44:15.847]  That came later.
[01:44:16.873 --> 01:44:24.398]  It was tens of thousands, more than 20,000 SA members killed in a couple-week period.
[01:44:24.438 --> 01:44:30.742]  But in the Night of the Long Knives, they killed over a thousand of the leadership, including Ernst Röhm.
[01:44:31.182 --> 01:44:32.803]  And they would do it inside their houses.
[01:44:33.283 --> 01:44:35.264]  They would get them in a car and take them down the street.
[01:44:35.284 --> 01:44:42.809]  And it's called the Night of the Long Knives because they bound them, gag them, and then slit their throats in ditches and at the end of cul-de-sacs.
[01:44:43.169 --> 01:44:45.910]  Now, purges are the first thing that's done once they take full power.
[01:45:11.085 --> 01:45:14.708]  And you are the number one target.
[01:45:14.888 --> 01:45:23.374]  Dirty cops, drug dealing cops, corrupt FBI, hostage rescue team people, protective services and the federal marshals.
[01:45:24.695 --> 01:45:28.919]  Those of you that wouldn't, the good guys who wouldn't take part in bad as well, but also the bad.
[01:45:29.499 --> 01:45:32.101]  You are going to be killed.
[01:45:33.934 --> 01:45:35.255]  Now they didn't believe it in Germany.
[01:45:35.315 --> 01:45:36.355]  They didn't believe it in Russia.
[01:45:36.395 --> 01:45:37.576]  They didn't believe it in China.
[01:45:37.916 --> 01:45:40.417]  They didn't believe it in a hundred plus countries.
[01:45:40.917 --> 01:45:42.298]  They didn't believe it in Rhodesia.
[01:45:42.918 --> 01:45:44.279]  They didn't believe it in Rwanda.
[01:45:44.639 --> 01:45:47.541]  They didn't believe it in Nicaragua or El Salvador.
[01:45:47.961 --> 01:45:49.262]  They didn't believe it in Chile.
[01:45:49.542 --> 01:45:51.743]  They didn't believe it in any of these places.
[01:45:51.983 --> 01:45:52.643]  Brazil.
[01:45:54.764 --> 01:45:55.725]  Sierra Leone.
[01:45:57.686 --> 01:46:00.067]  I want you when you're on your knees in a ditch
[01:46:00.712 --> 01:46:02.674]  Or in some federal processing center.
[01:46:03.094 --> 01:46:13.683]  And these guys are strutting around laughing, and they're felons, they're illegal aliens, they're black ops, and I want you, right as you hear them, cartridge and load the gun.
[01:46:13.883 --> 01:46:15.204]  Right as you hear them, chamber them around.
[01:46:15.264 --> 01:46:26.813]  I want you, when you're in there, smelling your last smells, seeing your last thing, right as they're giggling, and there's a row of your dead buddies lined up next to you, I want you to remember that I warned you!
[01:46:29.503 --> 01:46:31.084]  Don't be like Ernst Röhm.
[01:46:32.825 --> 01:46:41.490]  Don't be like the 20,000 SA exterminated by Adolf Hitler two months after he came to power.
[01:46:43.412 --> 01:46:45.253]  Because they know where all the bodies are buried.
[01:46:45.513 --> 01:46:48.234]  They have the system to overthrow the order.
[01:46:48.575 --> 01:46:50.396]  They are more worried about you
[01:46:52.686 --> 01:47:01.548]  Blocking them, taking power from them, you remembering the story you were told of why you were doing this, and then questioning, and then they're going to bring in the real dogs behind you.
[01:47:02.128 --> 01:47:21.193]  That aggravated felon they hired that you're forced to work with in black ops, that criminal you've been forced to work with, that illegal you've been forced to work with, that Czech Republic, that Russian, that Manilin, they're the ones that are going to be blowing your heads off, not us.
[01:47:23.061 --> 01:47:24.021]  You understand me.
[01:47:24.442 --> 01:47:25.902]  I don't want you to be hurt.
[01:47:26.423 --> 01:47:27.723]  I don't want you to die.
[01:47:28.824 --> 01:47:35.787]  I hate it when you set up old farmers who've got black powder, which is totally legal just because your bosses want the property.
[01:47:37.367 --> 01:47:39.568]  And you have really cursed yourself doing that.
[01:47:40.409 --> 01:47:42.770]  You bought more bad luck than you can possibly imagine.
[01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:44.631]  You got God to deal with.
[01:47:45.391 --> 01:47:51.754]  But I don't hate you, and I realize you're weak-minded and we're sucked into a gang mentality and used.
[01:47:52.702 --> 01:48:06.464]  But I'm telling you as a student of history that you'd better listen up and you'd better listen good and hard to what I'm saying because I'm telling you the truth.
[01:48:10.540 --> 01:48:10.941]  We're good to go.
[01:48:26.011 --> 01:48:34.357]  Iraq to Iran, heralding the birth of a now saturated propaganda talking point that Iran is fueling the violence in Iraq and helping to kill U.S.
[01:48:34.397 --> 01:48:42.482]  troops, despite the fact that British officials patrolling Iran and Iraq's border admit there is no concrete proof that Iran is supplying Iraq.
[01:48:43.303 --> 01:48:49.427]  Rumsfeld's obsession with micromanaging every aspect of the propaganda offensive upon the American people led to him
[01:48:50.296 --> 01:49:10.143]  Disseminating anything of up to 60 quote snowflakes or memos every single day which, to the chagrin of Pentagon employees, his insistence that an artificial climate of fear be maintained in America about the threat of new terror attacks in order to sell the unpopular war in Iraq or the smoking gun for criminal charges to be initiated.
[01:49:12.144 --> 01:49:15.485]  By several of the very definitions of terrorism, Rumsfeld has
[01:49:16.815 --> 01:49:21.179]  Probably engaged in terrorism by hyping the threat of terror to achieve a political objective.
[01:49:21.519 --> 01:49:22.780]  Definitions of terrorism.
[01:49:23.301 --> 01:49:30.147]  A psychological strategy of war by gaining political ends by deliberately creating a well-founded climate of fear among the civilian population.
[01:49:30.808 --> 01:49:37.974]  The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence against people or property to coerce or intimidate governments or societies.
[01:49:38.514 --> 01:49:39.936]  The systematic use of terror
[01:49:41.824 --> 01:49:45.546]  And deliberate creation of exploitation of fear to bring about political change.
[01:49:46.046 --> 01:49:48.747]  You are guilty of terrorism!
[01:49:49.088 --> 01:49:51.209]  You are a terrorist, Rumsfeld!
[01:49:53.550 --> 01:49:54.950]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:54.970 --> 01:49:57.091]  A new world order.
[01:49:57.792 --> 01:50:02.554]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful group of government.
[01:50:02.694 --> 01:50:04.435]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[01:50:04.655 --> 01:50:07.756]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:50:08.297 --> 01:50:10.718]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:11.477 --> 01:50:18.781]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:21.812 --> 01:50:26.815]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:27.276 --> 01:50:30.778]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.138 --> 01:50:33.660]  Bill of Rights makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:34.861]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:34.881 --> 01:50:35.641]  They're not after money.
[01:50:35.661 --> 01:50:36.722]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:36.922 --> 01:50:37.683]  They're after power.
[01:50:37.923 --> 01:50:38.923]  That's what they're after.

[01:50:52.372 --> 01:50:57.475]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:57.535 --> 01:51:04.860]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:15.666]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:15.826 --> 01:51:20.389]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:20.649 --> 01:51:25.652]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:51:25.852 --> 01:51:28.793]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:29.033 --> 01:51:38.878]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:51:58.233 --> 01:52:02.457]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:52:02.877 --> 01:52:09.743]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:52:10.163 --> 01:52:16.868]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:52:17.208 --> 01:52:18.809]  There are no reported side effects.

[01:52:40.744 --> 01:52:43.786]  Man thinks, cause he rules the earth, he can do anything.
[01:53:01.597 --> 01:53:29.382]  And if things don't change soon He will For a man is invaded, he's doomed First step was touching the moon Now there's a woman on my block She said, just sit there and the night grows still She said, who's gonna take away his license to kill?
[01:53:32.362 --> 01:53:50.531]  Now they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life and they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill and they bury him with stars
[01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:52.841]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:53:56.745 --> 01:53:59.247]  Ted Anderson just came in during the break and said that those deals

[01:56:13.993 --> 01:56:16.136]  We couldn't have worse psychopaths running things.
[01:56:16.196 --> 01:56:17.918]  It's all about what they can get away with.
[01:56:18.218 --> 01:56:19.820]  And they're trying to set it up to go for broke.

[01:56:52.287 --> 01:56:53.727]  No more showings here in Austin.
[01:56:54.848 --> 01:56:59.109]  I know we've got a lot of callers that are holding, and I'm going to continue with open phones next hour.
[01:56:59.907 --> 01:57:02.570]  I got into some of the Rumsfeld propaganda terrorism news.
[01:57:02.610 --> 01:57:04.872]  I haven't gotten into the global tax news.
[01:57:04.932 --> 01:57:05.913]  Big developments there.
[01:57:06.533 --> 01:57:08.575]  And more on the economy and the police state.
[01:57:08.975 --> 01:57:11.317]  More cities call for cameras in citizens' homes.
[01:57:12.078 --> 01:57:16.262]  More cities call for new tattletale cores for the environment.
[01:57:17.447 --> 01:57:19.628]  Again, they've just launched their attack.
[01:57:19.688 --> 01:57:24.609]  We're going into the heavy jump point now where everything goes to another level just like that.
[01:57:25.369 --> 01:57:27.250]  So we're locked in, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:32.331]  We're in battle formation going in against the New World Order.

[01:57:57.590 --> 01:58:01.395]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.776 --> 01:58:05.861]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.943 --> 01:58:10.586]  We are, no doubt, in the final days of the Republic.
[01:58:10.626 --> 01:58:24.118]  Barring a miracle, the globalists have fully gotten our economy debased, our industry annihilated, the military police state geared up to full Pentagon-designed control grids.
[01:58:25.559 --> 01:58:31.484]  They are engaging in massive eugenics attacks against the entire population, every single man, woman, and child of you globally.
[01:58:32.722 --> 01:58:42.130]  We are desperately here doing all we can do, people who have basic morals, and that is we're trying to warn you about the unbelievable, heinous things already happening.
[01:58:42.170 --> 01:58:43.311]  They're only a prelude.
[01:58:43.852 --> 01:58:48.616]  The enemy is attacking us at every level, but all of this is simply their vanguard scouts.
[01:58:49.336 --> 01:58:54.701]  They have been for over a hundred years arranging this final push for absolute world government.
[01:58:55.922 --> 01:59:03.246]  The attacks at every level, of course, are intensifying, but that only wakes more people up, and the New World Order can't help themselves.
[01:59:03.286 --> 01:59:04.267]  It's the nature of power.
[01:59:04.787 --> 01:59:11.631]  They are blowing out their own engine while they run over us, but nevertheless, they will succeed in plowing us down.
[01:59:12.031 --> 01:59:13.732]  But in that is their defeat.
[01:59:14.253 --> 01:59:19.316]  So again, when I say battle formation, ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake, there's a war on for your mind.
[01:59:19.856 --> 01:59:23.438]  It's also a physical war, and make no mistake, you need to
[01:59:23.638 --> 01:59:24.078]  Thank you.
[01:59:54.868 --> 01:59:55.348]  I am here.
[01:59:55.369 --> 01:59:56.429]  I am Alex Jones.
[01:59:56.509 --> 01:59:59.551]  I am simply the organic response to the New World Order.
[01:59:59.811 --> 02:00:03.033]  I have literally grown up right out of the ground like all of you.
[02:00:03.794 --> 02:00:08.196]  Uncoordinated, unfocused at the beginning in resistance to these people.
[02:00:08.276 --> 02:00:09.197]  What did they expect?
[02:00:09.237 --> 02:00:13.220]  They're so shocked by our massive resistance, the exponential growth of it.
[02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:18.423]  They are so shocked by activism and resistance, the numbers of which they can't control or divert.
[02:00:18.803 --> 02:00:21.645]  They're very upset that their main propaganda arms are being
[02:00:22.285 --> 02:00:33.310]  Exposed and rendered almost useless, but they are now responding with almost insane giddiness, snickering and giggling about how they're going to stage terror attacks.
[02:00:33.770 --> 02:00:45.396]  I mean, do not forget that Gary Hart came out in a letter to Iran and said, our government stages terror attacks, so don't be smirking over there and thinking the people won't attack you just because 70-80% are against the war.
[02:00:45.736 --> 02:00:48.457]  Our government stages attacks, and you better submit
[02:00:49.597 --> 02:00:51.057]  Think of the arrogance of that.
[02:00:51.117 --> 02:00:52.878]  Think of the digittiness of him.
[02:00:53.318 --> 02:01:00.659]  But I saw him, right before 9-11, get up and make a declarative announcement, and I went on the air the next day and said, ladies and gentlemen, brace yourselves.
[02:01:00.739 --> 02:01:15.022]  Well, I'm telling you right now, these nuts have never been defeated, they have never been stopped, they have never been resisted, and they just have gotten away with whatever they want for 80, 90, 100 years, and they're just absolute piratical vermin.
[02:01:16.477 --> 02:01:25.200]  And they've got the biggest and best think tanks and the biggest and best brains working for them, but I guarantee you, they're not listening to them, because the think tanks are telling them, back off and slow down.
[02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:28.101]  And a large segment of the New World Order has said, put the brakes on.
[02:01:28.541 --> 02:01:34.363]  Not because they're good, but because they realize we're... But it's just like Hitler turning into Russia, or Napoleon turning into it.
[02:01:34.723 --> 02:01:36.104]  It's just like any of these guys.
[02:01:36.144 --> 02:01:38.105]  They've just got yes-men all around them.
[02:01:40.145 --> 02:01:41.246]  And they just love it.
[02:01:43.018 --> 02:01:51.365]  And they're very arrogant and very haughty, and if they think they're going to lose, they'll just throw it into a whole other level of crises, failing forward, as they call it.
[02:01:52.106 --> 02:01:56.330]  So I'm going to tell you right now, red alert, red alert, red alert.
[02:01:57.020 --> 02:02:00.582]  The New World Order is absolutely out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:01.022 --> 02:02:03.143]  And they are moving against free humanity at every level.
[02:02:03.484 --> 02:02:06.585]  Gold has hit $807 an ounce.
[02:02:07.046 --> 02:02:10.868]  It just went up a dollar in the last five minutes.
[02:02:10.988 --> 02:02:12.529]  This is unbelievable.
[02:02:12.949 --> 02:02:13.929]  You know what that means.
[02:02:14.129 --> 02:02:16.751]  All confidence in the dollar is now imploding.
[02:02:18.630 --> 02:02:20.631]  This is like being in an airplane.
[02:02:20.651 --> 02:02:25.033]  You know you're going to crash in five minutes and everybody's on board drinking champagne and snickering at you.
[02:02:25.874 --> 02:02:29.655]  I mean, you'd think, you know, I'm in the gold business a little bit that I'd be happy about this.
[02:02:29.796 --> 02:02:31.236]  I am not happy about this.
[02:02:32.897 --> 02:02:34.178]  It means they're keeping their promise.
[02:02:36.539 --> 02:02:37.219]  Oh, man.
[02:02:37.439 --> 02:02:37.999]  Heaven help us.
[02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:39.000]  We'll come back with your calls.
[02:02:45.563 --> 02:02:46.884]  It is a big idea
[02:02:48.038 --> 02:02:49.059]  A New World Order!
[02:02:49.799 --> 02:02:53.981]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:02:54.702 --> 02:02:56.463]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:02:56.663 --> 02:02:59.785]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:03:00.305 --> 02:03:02.746]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:03.487 --> 02:03:10.811]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:13.829 --> 02:03:18.812]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:19.292 --> 02:03:22.754]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:23.155 --> 02:03:25.676]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:03:25.716 --> 02:03:26.857]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:26.897 --> 02:03:27.637]  They're not after money.
[02:03:27.657 --> 02:03:28.738]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:28.958 --> 02:03:29.678]  They're after power.
[02:03:29.919 --> 02:03:31.059]  That's what they're after, you see.

[02:04:49.362 --> 02:04:51.244]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:04:51.444 --> 02:04:54.486]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:04:54.666 --> 02:04:57.808]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:04:58.108 --> 02:04:59.949]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.770]  We're good to go.

[02:05:54.565 --> 02:05:55.406]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.147 --> 02:05:58.070]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.090 --> 02:06:01.594]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.895 --> 02:06:05.980]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.481 --> 02:06:13.162]  Now, eight minutes into this third hour of transmission against tyranny.
[02:06:13.842 --> 02:06:16.783]  This is the warning call from the parapet.
[02:06:17.424 --> 02:06:21.925]  Enemy forces within the fortress, enemy forces without.
[02:06:22.285 --> 02:06:28.647]  They've lowered the drawbridge, they're overrunning us with third world populations, incinerating any of our economy we have left.
[02:06:28.687 --> 02:06:31.068]  We are under economic, psychological, spiritual
[02:06:32.029 --> 02:06:33.970]  And of course, physical bombardment.
[02:06:34.050 --> 02:06:36.271]  We are under siege, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:37.472 --> 02:06:42.415]  Alright, I'm gonna go to Scott, Timothy, John, John, Nick, and others right now.
[02:06:42.515 --> 02:06:54.081]  But Dr. Deagle, who has his own show here on the network, has called in, and a medical doctor, and has a show on the New World Order, and Doc wanted to comment on something.
[02:06:54.101 --> 02:06:55.021]  What's going on, Dr. Deagle?
[02:06:58.043 --> 02:06:59.464]  Do you have him, or is he not there?
[02:07:00.246 --> 02:07:01.087]  This is Dr. Bill Hill.
[02:07:01.288 --> 02:07:02.329]  Go ahead, you're on air.
[02:07:02.649 --> 02:07:02.870]  Hi.
[02:07:03.451 --> 02:07:04.912]  I've got some breaking news.
[02:07:05.013 --> 02:07:13.884]  I can't release the name yet, but we're going here in the next few days with a story from a scientist working on embryo research in New Jersey with a big drug company.
[02:07:14.505 --> 02:07:17.289]  I won't mention the name of the company, but it's one of the large pharmaceuticals.
[02:07:18.098 --> 02:07:34.471]  And they apparently have a leak of a gene bioweapon that actually got out and infected this individual and they were told by this drug company that the only way they would help her is you should sign over her body and her blood and fluid and other tissues of her body in order for them to investigate.
[02:07:35.172 --> 02:07:37.674]  What's going on is exactly like you say in Endgame.
[02:07:37.714 --> 02:07:39.115]  I've seen the movie last week.
[02:07:39.996 --> 02:07:40.856]  It's far worse than that.
[02:07:40.876 --> 02:07:42.518]  You've actually toned it down, Alex.
[02:07:42.618 --> 02:07:45.260]  You have so much knowledge on this and you're right on.
[02:07:45.961 --> 02:07:46.341]  This is
[02:07:47.315 --> 02:07:48.436]  Yeah, exactly as you say.
[02:07:48.696 --> 02:07:52.498]  We're now seeing the enemy enter the walls of the fortress.
[02:07:52.598 --> 02:07:54.519]  We have them attacking us on every level.
[02:07:54.979 --> 02:07:57.340]  When people get off of the foolishness, it's not documented.
[02:07:57.420 --> 02:08:10.386]  It's so aggravating because we have financial attack, biological, they're going to weaponize our food, they're trying to vaccinate us and even change our brain pathways by creating plaque and different neural pathways that literally turn us into non-humans.
[02:08:11.367 --> 02:08:15.269]  It's just beyond the pale and now we're going to be releasing in the next few days a story
[02:08:16.325 --> 02:08:20.969]  of the scientists actually is infected with this gene that jumps and changes human genetics.
[02:08:21.029 --> 02:08:23.491]  It's actually a gene for the potassium channel.
[02:08:23.531 --> 02:08:26.493]  She's got a periodic paralysis syndrome that's probably going to kill her.
[02:08:27.174 --> 02:08:31.397]  But they say they'll only help her if she'll sign her body over to this drug company.
[02:08:32.358 --> 02:08:34.779]  Alright Dr. Diegel, thank you and we'll talk to you soon.
[02:08:36.861 --> 02:08:39.583]  By the way, I had some reason it didn't print up in my stack today.
[02:08:39.623 --> 02:08:40.484]  I read it this morning.
[02:08:40.504 --> 02:08:41.925]  I'd already seen it years ago.
[02:08:42.345 --> 02:08:44.427]  Literally hundreds of companies are working on this.
[02:08:45.922 --> 02:09:02.539]  It is a type of white lab mouse that lives twice as long, eats half as much, reproduces more, has twice as much sexual energy, has less diseases,
[02:09:04.346 --> 02:09:06.328]  And it's all with gene manipulation.
[02:09:06.388 --> 02:09:09.370]  This is what the globalists want for themselves.
[02:09:09.591 --> 02:09:12.333]  And they test it on us, they test it on animals.
[02:09:12.954 --> 02:09:17.618]  Whatever works, they warehouse and develop and kick it into national security for themselves as it comes out.
[02:09:18.598 --> 02:09:22.842]  And then they take whatever they learn negatively with these systems and use it against us.
[02:09:23.503 --> 02:09:26.906]  That's why people get cancer like people used to get the yearly cold now.
[02:09:28.979 --> 02:09:34.502]  That's why diabetes is up several thousand percent, most of the food genetic chimera cross-species.
[02:09:36.843 --> 02:09:37.864]  It's just unspeakable.
[02:09:37.904 --> 02:09:38.924]  I mean, literally, folks.
[02:09:42.986 --> 02:09:52.411]  It's, you know, when Dr. Deagle just mentioned plaque-forming vaccines, three years ago, London Independent, London Guardian, BBC reported like it was positive.
[02:09:53.472 --> 02:09:57.314]  And they said, there's a move by the health service in England to make it the law.
[02:09:58.061 --> 02:10:05.029]  That all children in the country must take a vaccine that will cure them of ever being able to have drug addiction.
[02:10:05.890 --> 02:10:14.300]  And it's said that a live virus enters the brain and attacks the receptors in the areas of the brain and the virus is tailored to attack them.
[02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:17.570]  Now understand, they just say it like it's good, though.
[02:10:17.991 --> 02:10:22.493]  This would be like if I wrote an article saying, oh, there's a wonderful new invention, the 357 Magnum.
[02:10:22.513 --> 02:10:28.316]  You shoot yourselves five times in the head with it, and it's so wonderful and good, and oh my gosh, we should do it for all the children.
[02:10:29.255 --> 02:10:31.677]  But see, they just put pure evil out like it's normal.
[02:10:31.997 --> 02:10:45.849]  Oh, there's a move to make everyone take this, because they'll never be able to be addicted to cocaine, or heroin, or cigarettes, because nicotine, heroin, cocaine, and other narcotics, and by the way, that's what nicotine is the true class that's in the receptors it hits.
[02:10:46.490 --> 02:10:47.431]  Go look it up yourself.
[02:10:47.871 --> 02:10:48.992]  More addictive than cocaine.
[02:10:49.784 --> 02:10:58.807]  Believe me, I know, ladies and gentlemen, I've never used drugs or liked drugs, used marijuana a couple times and hated it, but cigarettes I literally have a continual battle with.
[02:10:59.387 --> 02:11:04.029]  Chewing tobacco, any cigars, anything, I smell it, I never get over it.
[02:11:04.709 --> 02:11:05.770]  I've got those receptors.
[02:11:06.210 --> 02:11:16.534]  So the answer, I guess, would be to take this injection and it will go in and kill the receptors.
[02:11:18.442 --> 02:11:26.286]  Kill the brain cells and secrete plaques, viral plaques, in the brain.
[02:11:28.147 --> 02:11:31.349]  And this is what they're openly pushing and openly saying we all need.
[02:11:31.369 --> 02:11:32.630]  They're now pushing it here in the U.S.
[02:11:32.690 --> 02:11:34.491]  and some people aren't even giving it to their children.
[02:11:34.811 --> 02:11:36.272]  But it's not, quote, mandatory yet.
[02:11:36.332 --> 02:11:37.112]  And that's even a fraud.
[02:11:37.152 --> 02:11:37.792]  It's not mandatory.
[02:11:37.832 --> 02:11:40.614]  They just say you have to have it to go to school when there's not even a law.
[02:11:43.968 --> 02:11:46.288]  I know I talk about that every few weeks, I just can't get over it.
[02:11:46.549 --> 02:11:50.309]  The whole new generation of viruses, of vaccines, are live viruses.
[02:11:50.889 --> 02:11:54.810]  The HPV, for human papillomavirus, only covers six strains.
[02:11:55.170 --> 02:11:56.490]  There's over 300 strains.
[02:11:58.251 --> 02:12:04.192]  And they want to force the girls to take this when they admit it doesn't even cover the six strains.
[02:12:04.612 --> 02:12:09.613]  And then it causes all those autoimmune disorders and deaths and Ebola-like deaths where they bleed out.
[02:12:10.911 --> 02:12:16.672]  The mouse that shook the world, it can run for hours at 20 meters per minute without getting tired.
[02:12:16.732 --> 02:12:20.193]  It lives longer, has more sex and eats more without gaining weight.
[02:12:20.573 --> 02:12:23.414]  Could the science that created the super mouse be applied to humans?
[02:12:24.034 --> 02:12:25.135]  London Independent today.
[02:12:25.695 --> 02:12:26.595]  Associated Press.
[02:12:26.735 --> 02:12:26.915]  U.S.
[02:12:26.955 --> 02:12:29.116]  scientist, engineer, Mighty Mice.
[02:12:29.536 --> 02:12:29.816]  The U.S.
[02:12:29.856 --> 02:12:31.856]  researchers have engineered a line of Mighty Mice.
[02:12:32.076 --> 02:12:33.737]  Oh boy, you know they're going to get out too.
[02:12:34.277 --> 02:12:38.998]  Whose human equivalent would have similar abilities to bicycle and champion Lawrence Armstrong.
[02:12:39.757 --> 02:12:45.020]  Yes, Lance did have some special research done according to research published Thursday.
[02:12:45.601 --> 02:12:46.802]  And it continues.
[02:12:47.262 --> 02:12:51.484]  This is out of medical health and fitness news.
[02:12:51.564 --> 02:12:54.006]  GeneTweak makes for mighty mice.
[02:12:54.686 --> 02:12:58.909]  Scientists genetically engineer mice that could run and outlive ordinary mice.
[02:12:59.629 --> 02:13:01.631]  So there you have it ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:02.491 --> 02:13:04.112]  Let us now go back to your calls.
[02:13:05.253 --> 02:13:06.154]  Let us talk to
[02:13:08.167 --> 02:13:09.908]  Scott in Arizona, thanks for holding.
[02:13:09.928 --> 02:13:15.809]  Hey Alex, I want to find out if you had a guest on your show named Jim Phelps.
[02:13:16.049 --> 02:13:16.830]  Are you familiar with him?
[02:13:17.550 --> 02:13:19.750]  You know, it rings a bell, but I don't remember.
[02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:20.170]  Who is he?
[02:13:21.251 --> 02:13:30.713]  He is a guy that has worked for the DOE, and he's a whistleblower, and he's got a site called DOE Watch, and he worked on the Manhattan Project.
[02:13:30.753 --> 02:13:32.534]  He worked at Oak Ridge Labs.
[02:13:33.331 --> 02:13:40.156]  He is coming out, he's the leading guy talking about, and actually he's the one that developed the whole thing that you see in the skies.
[02:13:41.037 --> 02:13:44.679]  And he's basically breaking it down, he even breaks it down to chemical form and everything.
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:49.763]  And he's, I've researched this guy out, he even brings out his paperwork, you can research him out.
[02:13:49.983 --> 02:13:53.626]  He, like you, he asks you to research him out, just don't take his word for it.
[02:13:54.225 --> 02:14:14.225]  And I've also talked to the DOE themselves, so basically what I'm trying to say is he's kind of led me on to open my eyes to what's going on, because I couldn't take the chemtrail word because they can deny that all they want, so I need to have their own... Well it's weird, they deny it, and then on Discovery Channel and in government authorized textbooks they say they're spraying it for our own good.
[02:14:14.867 --> 02:14:16.407]  Well, here's the deal, Alex.
[02:14:16.547 --> 02:14:18.248]  I've got it researched to the hilt now.
[02:14:18.688 --> 02:14:22.668]  You want to know exactly who it is, it's the DOE, and it's under the ARM program.
[02:14:22.868 --> 02:14:28.269]  You can type this up right on Google and get it, and they blatantly, openly admit what they're doing.
[02:14:28.489 --> 02:14:33.030]  It's called indirect, direct, and semi-direct aerosol campaign.
[02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:36.171]  And what they call it in the air is called scattering.
[02:14:37.051 --> 02:14:43.592]  And so basically what they're doing is, the real thing behind global warming, the heat, is because the ozone got depleted.
[02:14:44.324 --> 02:15:03.338]  And because of Freon, first at the Manhattan Project, there was a big chemical outburst, a lot of Freon went at that time, and that and coal emissions and everything made the ozone, or a hole in the ozone, and basically our cloud formations came... No, no, that's what the Feds have admitted in dozens of places.
[02:15:03.358 --> 02:15:07.141]  They say, yes, it's a secret program, we're spraying sunscreen for the planet.
[02:15:07.955 --> 02:15:08.716]  Yeah, and it's not.
[02:15:08.776 --> 02:15:09.617]  And he breaks it down.
[02:15:09.657 --> 02:15:12.419]  He says many compounds, and he breaks it all down.
[02:15:12.739 --> 02:15:15.462]  Aluminum oxide is the main particle of the reactor.
[02:15:16.403 --> 02:15:18.965]  And he talks about all that in great detail.
[02:15:19.045 --> 02:15:23.549]  And I even talked to the ARM program, and they wanted to get my name and find out who I was.
[02:15:23.630 --> 02:15:25.171]  I definitely blocked my call.
[02:15:25.231 --> 02:15:26.112]  Okay, here's the deal.
[02:15:26.172 --> 02:15:26.712]  Here's the deal.
[02:15:27.133 --> 02:15:29.675]  Give me his name again and his website, and I'll get him on.
[02:15:30.236 --> 02:15:31.717]  Okay, his name is Jim Phelps.
[02:15:32.037 --> 02:15:33.659]  That's P-H-E-L-P-S.
[02:15:34.991 --> 02:15:37.678]  And he has a site called DOE Watch.
[02:15:42.326 --> 02:15:42.866]  I'm not sure.
[02:15:42.886 --> 02:15:47.167]  I just put in DOE Watch and click on Google and get it from there.
[02:15:47.967 --> 02:15:48.967]  Alright.
[02:15:48.987 --> 02:15:50.228]  So what did they say when you called them up?
[02:15:50.248 --> 02:15:51.688]  They said, we're spraying it because we love you?
[02:15:51.708 --> 02:15:52.688]  They were very nervous.
[02:15:52.868 --> 02:15:54.189]  And I told them, I used their words.
[02:15:54.289 --> 02:15:58.409]  I said, listen, most people, I said, I know the public doesn't know what these chemtrails and all that.
[02:15:58.709 --> 02:16:00.070]  I said, I know it's called indirect.
[02:16:00.670 --> 02:16:07.511]  At first, I acted like I was from a university, because some universities are studying this in their atmospheric research division.
[02:16:08.071 --> 02:16:09.732]  Yeah, MIT announced it.
[02:16:09.832 --> 02:16:10.992]  They're just now announcing it.
[02:16:11.815 --> 02:16:14.536]  Yeah, so basically I acted like I was researching the workout.
[02:16:14.876 --> 02:16:18.037]  So I got her to admit some stuff and then I brought out the other stuff.
[02:16:18.357 --> 02:16:20.198]  And then she started asking me, who am I?
[02:16:21.278 --> 02:16:25.460]  And, you know, I told her that all the things I know about it.
[02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:26.660]  And she didn't deny it at all.
[02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:28.221]  She wanted me to talk to her manager.
[02:16:28.981 --> 02:16:31.722]  And it started getting really deep.
[02:16:31.782 --> 02:16:38.424]  It's part of the Battelle organization, which is linked to the ARM program, which stands for Atmospheric Radiation Measurement.
[02:16:39.324 --> 02:16:45.187]  Okay, and the scattering is the indirect, semi-direct, and direct aerosol campaign.
[02:16:45.227 --> 02:16:46.428]  All you have to do is type that in.
[02:16:46.468 --> 02:16:48.429]  Just put indirect aerosol campaign on there.
[02:16:48.729 --> 02:16:50.450]  It'll openly admit what they're doing.
[02:16:50.810 --> 02:16:59.175]  And see, not the public doesn't know what it's called, so they all have these chemtrail sites, and they basically, they're testing in the air what they're seeing up there.
[02:16:59.215 --> 02:17:00.856]  Some have some decent information.
[02:17:01.176 --> 02:17:08.460]  But if you want to use their terminology from the ARM program, that's exactly who's in your airspace doing this and spraying us.
[02:17:10.671 --> 02:17:17.875]  Yeah, I just found the federal government's own website.
[02:17:17.915 --> 02:17:19.496]  And there are 125,000 hits.
[02:17:19.716 --> 02:17:20.596]  They're all government.
[02:17:21.717 --> 02:17:25.959]  And it says, yeah, it says creating clouds.
[02:17:27.981 --> 02:17:29.381]  I'm sure it's all good for us.
[02:17:29.601 --> 02:17:30.842]  Just the government loves you, okay?
[02:17:31.643 --> 02:17:32.483]  I'll check into it.
[02:17:32.503 --> 02:17:33.023]  See, I love it.
[02:17:33.264 --> 02:17:35.065]  This guy actually called in with real information.
[02:17:35.865 --> 02:17:37.306]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:45.291 --> 02:17:51.513]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:17:51.953 --> 02:17:59.735]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:18:00.075 --> 02:18:07.917]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:18:08.237 --> 02:18:13.002]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:18:13.322 --> 02:18:18.047]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:18:18.547 --> 02:18:22.411]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:18:22.912 --> 02:18:23.913]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:23.993 --> 02:18:28.017]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:18:28.477 --> 02:18:32.878]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:18:33.398 --> 02:18:35.938]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:18:36.378 --> 02:18:38.499]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:38.639 --> 02:18:41.759]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:41.879 --> 02:18:47.620]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:56.862]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number 1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:18:57.876 --> 02:19:02.825]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 14th Amendment?
[02:19:03.887 --> 02:19:05.711]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:19:06.091 --> 02:19:06.873]  There may be more.
[02:19:08.058 --> 02:19:14.863]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[02:19:15.544 --> 02:19:23.410]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to the Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:24.230 --> 02:19:25.791]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:25.811 --> 02:19:26.152]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:38.271 --> 02:19:41.813]  Call now, our operators are standing by to take your order.
[02:19:45.155 --> 02:19:47.096]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[02:19:47.536 --> 02:19:50.998]  Look, up there in the sky, it's Non-X-Man!
[02:19:51.398 --> 02:19:52.559]  He's in a dive!
[02:19:52.859 --> 02:19:54.840]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:55.921]  Let's go look.
[02:19:58.142 --> 02:20:01.324]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[02:20:01.744 --> 02:20:03.044]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[02:20:03.065 --> 02:20:03.725]  Take them out.
[02:20:04.364 --> 02:20:05.024]  Let's see.
[02:20:05.044 --> 02:20:09.666]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[02:20:09.686 --> 02:20:10.447]  Don't worry.
[02:20:10.907 --> 02:20:12.428]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:20:13.048 --> 02:20:17.470]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:20.071]  Oh, I will Non-X Man.
[02:20:20.191 --> 02:20:22.892]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[02:20:25.013 --> 02:20:27.674]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[02:20:28.134 --> 02:20:31.615]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[02:20:32.135 --> 02:20:43.258]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[02:20:44.631 --> 02:20:47.573]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:20:47.733 --> 02:20:52.897]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:20:53.257 --> 02:20:58.541]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:20:58.961 --> 02:21:00.062]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:00.442 --> 02:21:09.509]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:21:09.789 --> 02:21:11.370]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[02:21:11.610 --> 02:21:20.456]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[02:21:20.836 --> 02:21:24.299]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[02:21:24.679 --> 02:21:26.720]  Before you slip into unconsciousness
[02:21:54.625 --> 02:22:07.737]  Coming up, genetic advances to pioneer superhuman elite.
[02:22:08.058 --> 02:22:14.524]  New story up on presentplanet.com.
[02:22:21.095 --> 02:22:23.657]  Another headline is the dollars fall spiraling out of control.
[02:22:23.677 --> 02:22:27.159]  Take a few of your calls for those holding here in just a moment.
[02:22:27.239 --> 02:22:29.260]  Timothy, John, John, Nick, and others.
[02:22:29.740 --> 02:22:31.401]  Boy, Scott just called with a good tip.
[02:22:31.461 --> 02:22:33.182]  It sure checked out to Ariel Spring.
[02:22:33.202 --> 02:22:36.144]  And we've just run smack dab into another.
[02:22:36.164 --> 02:22:39.366]  I mean, as horrible as you can imagine, it's always 10,000 times worse.
[02:22:39.426 --> 02:22:42.368]  I mean, it's just all in your faces, people.
[02:22:44.199 --> 02:22:58.659]  And to combat all the spraying and poisons and things, it's all organic, 20 power-packed ingredients, dulse kelp, barley grass, wheat grass, colerulus, beryllina, balance energy all day long, greater stamina, 20 power-packed ingredients, reduced food cravings, healthy, radiant skin,
[02:22:59.239 --> 02:22:59.580]  I think so.
[02:23:16.031 --> 02:23:20.174]  Yeah, I talked to you before a couple times online, but I'm a former counterintelligence agent.
[02:23:46.053 --> 02:23:51.740]  I was going to talk about Fort Huachuca, Arizona and the torture training that goes on there.
[02:23:52.881 --> 02:23:54.342]  I actually went through the school.
[02:23:55.564 --> 02:23:58.447]  What they do is... That's the big intelligence training center now.
[02:23:58.527 --> 02:24:02.391]  Yes, I'm a graduate of the counterintelligence school there.
[02:24:02.552 --> 02:24:06.316]  What happens there is they bring you out about three hours into the desert.
[02:24:07.731 --> 02:24:16.654]  And there's a couple houses that are, there's three houses down by, down this cliff, and you, uh, with all your other agents, live on the top with the interrogators.
[02:24:17.185 --> 02:24:21.107]  And then you torture each other to quote, learn what the enemy is going to do to you.
[02:24:21.147 --> 02:24:21.987]  Let me stop, let me stop.
[02:24:22.027 --> 02:24:23.727]  But then they tell you it's really out of torture.
[02:24:23.747 --> 02:24:24.708]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:24:24.728 --> 02:24:27.729]  You don't torture each other, you're actually the torturers.
[02:24:28.449 --> 02:24:32.111]  You go down there and you talk to, like one example is, I went down there one time.
[02:24:32.411 --> 02:24:36.732]  See, this was before I woke up to the New World Order and I started listening to you and I didn't know I was doing anything wrong.
[02:24:37.052 --> 02:24:38.093]  Well, tell me what goes on here.
[02:24:38.113 --> 02:24:44.155]  Alright, so you go down there and there's instructors and they're the ones that you're trying to get information from.
[02:24:45.126 --> 02:24:52.912]  And you go there, and one specific example, I went down there, and she wouldn't tell me, you know, the information about a, you know, quote-unquote terrorist group.
[02:24:53.852 --> 02:25:00.837]  And I go down there, and so finally, they have to go to, you know, you got ego up, ego down, you got all these torture techniques.
[02:25:02.038 --> 02:25:08.183]  And I finally had to duct tape her hands to the table, and I simulated cutting her fingers off.
[02:25:09.504 --> 02:25:14.007]  And she was screaming, and screaming, and screaming, and she still wouldn't say, and so finally I said, alright,
[02:25:14.474 --> 02:25:20.558]  Put her on her knees, and my partner, we simulated an M16, and I said, put the M16 to the back of her head.
[02:25:21.919 --> 02:25:24.441]  And she got on her knees, and we put the M16 to the back of her head.
[02:25:24.461 --> 02:25:26.242]  She said, what about the Geneva Conventions?
[02:25:26.943 --> 02:25:30.025]  And I said, you know, bleep the Geneva Conventions, shoot her.
[02:25:30.886 --> 02:25:31.866]  And my partner shot her.
[02:25:31.886 --> 02:25:34.628]  You know, and bang, in the back of the head.
[02:25:34.968 --> 02:25:36.670]  And then, and then, did you get an A-plus?
[02:25:37.608 --> 02:25:38.869]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:25:38.909 --> 02:25:40.970]  We went back in front of the whole entire class.
[02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:43.652]  As a matter of fact, there's a big board with everyone's name on it.
[02:25:43.912 --> 02:25:47.715]  I had four stars beside my name.
[02:25:48.616 --> 02:25:54.700]  And it was four stars, and everyone said, the next interrogation interview you do, everyone will be present.
[02:25:55.801 --> 02:25:56.621]  And that's what I said.
[02:25:57.562 --> 02:25:58.903]  The Nazis did that.
[02:25:58.943 --> 02:26:02.245]  They set you up as the, oh, he's great.
[02:26:02.605 --> 02:26:03.005]  He's good.
[02:26:04.378 --> 02:26:06.840]  But in truth, it'll come down to torturing Americans.
[02:26:07.181 --> 02:26:07.901]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:26:08.001 --> 02:26:10.523]  And that's what goes on there in Fort Lauderdale, Arizona.
[02:26:10.543 --> 02:26:15.848]  And that's where, as a matter of fact, the majority of people that have a grave came right out of Fort Lauderdale, Arizona.
[02:26:15.868 --> 02:26:17.469]  Well, see, that's basic brainwash training.
[02:26:17.489 --> 02:26:18.651]  They put you in control.
[02:26:18.671 --> 02:26:19.852]  They put you in power.
[02:26:20.212 --> 02:26:22.394]  It's about you being a big star.
[02:26:23.094 --> 02:26:25.376]  And you're the ones getting brainwashed.
[02:26:25.396 --> 02:26:27.118]  You're the ones having your souls sucked.
[02:26:27.518 --> 02:26:32.240]  Right, and I admit that at one time I was, where I thought I did good.
[02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:36.862]  You know, I passed this course and I was... And of course they always use the best example.
[02:26:37.122 --> 02:26:44.145]  You know, these little mind games where they've got anthrax, it's going to detonate in a school, you've got to torture them to get the answers.
[02:26:44.525 --> 02:26:47.146]  And see, it's always that case that would never really come up.
[02:26:47.742 --> 02:26:48.743]  Right, right.
[02:26:49.184 --> 02:26:51.046]  And then really, it's the Army's own report.
[02:26:51.206 --> 02:26:58.493]  The Army's own report, 96% of those picked up at checkpoints in Iraq and taken to camps just didn't have their papers in order and they had to be tortured.
[02:26:58.753 --> 02:27:04.259]  Right, you know what's really funny, Alex, is my partner was one of the commercials, you know how they did Army of One commercials?
[02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:06.842]  He was an intelligence analyst.
[02:27:07.022 --> 02:27:07.602]  He went AWOL.
[02:27:09.488 --> 02:27:10.829]  Before you report it to his unit.
[02:27:11.249 --> 02:27:24.480]  Tell you what, I got a guest coming up, but I want you to briefly finish up what the morale is, and are the troops figuring this stuff out, what they've been taught to do, or how many of them are like Private Gruffheimer who loves it?
[02:27:24.921 --> 02:27:25.601]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.509 --> 02:27:36.550]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.911 --> 02:27:38.412]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.424 --> 02:27:42.186]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.587 --> 02:27:47.448]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:27:47.589 --> 02:27:52.711]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:27:52.871 --> 02:27:54.212]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:27:54.452 --> 02:28:02.597]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:28:02.817 --> 02:28:08.540]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:09.240]  I don't know.
[02:28:27.073 --> 02:28:27.754]  We're good to go.
[02:28:45.553 --> 02:28:46.714]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[02:28:46.734 --> 02:28:49.136]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:28:49.256 --> 02:28:52.238]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:28:52.299 --> 02:28:52.939]  is a real thing.
[02:28:53.059 --> 02:28:59.964]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[02:29:00.065 --> 02:29:10.813]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills fleshy bacteria, MRSA, acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[02:29:10.933 --> 02:29:11.454]  We're good to go.

[02:29:35.783 --> 02:29:37.145]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[02:29:37.205 --> 02:29:39.128]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:29:44.827 --> 02:29:49.091]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:29:49.331 --> 02:29:54.236]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:29:54.456 --> 02:29:55.797]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:29:55.957 --> 02:29:59.441]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[02:29:59.561 --> 02:30:04.725]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[02:30:11.071 --> 02:30:13.492]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[02:30:19.734 --> 02:30:20.654]  No animal testing.
[02:30:20.935 --> 02:30:22.235]  I use them and love them.
[02:30:22.255 --> 02:30:23.856]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:30:24.136 --> 02:30:25.296]  And I say it big time.
[02:30:25.556 --> 02:30:27.057]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.

[02:30:40.661 --> 02:30:43.161]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you how to play.

[02:31:14.182 --> 02:31:21.205]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones in the last ditch defense of the republic!
[02:31:21.225 --> 02:31:26.008]  Alright, let's go ahead and go back to Timothy in Florida.
[02:31:26.508 --> 02:31:37.755]  Well Timothy, what you're saying matches what I've seen in the news, but I would like to have you mail me some documentation or something, maybe we can have you on as an official guest to spend a whole hour walking through this.
[02:31:39.224 --> 02:31:45.187]  What percentage of people broke their conditioning or why did your friend who went to the intelligence training to go to Iraq, why did he go AWOL?
[02:31:45.647 --> 02:31:47.648]  When you talk to your army buddies, what did they say?
[02:31:47.728 --> 02:31:48.708]  Were you deployed?
[02:31:48.788 --> 02:31:49.548]  What did you see?
[02:31:49.929 --> 02:31:50.949]  Give us some more tidbits.
[02:31:51.529 --> 02:31:52.590]  Yes, I was deployed.
[02:31:52.610 --> 02:31:54.471]  I was deployed to Kuwait.
[02:31:55.051 --> 02:31:58.392]  This interrogation stuff, this training, this was before September 11th.
[02:31:59.213 --> 02:32:00.633]  This was before.
[02:32:01.374 --> 02:32:04.575]  I graduated intelligence school at Washuka in August.
[02:32:05.524 --> 02:32:10.088]  I've had special forces colonels on who tortured children, so yeah, I mean, that's been going on since Vietnam.
[02:32:10.648 --> 02:32:10.888]  Right.
[02:32:12.069 --> 02:32:31.163]  Yeah, but I called you before, and I talked to you actually offline, off the radio, and I have pieces of the World Trade Center that was given to me by another counterintelligence agent that was on the scene, and I mean, I agree with you that yeah, I tested it for explosives, they just say, oh, you know, it was because of Alex Jones.
[02:32:34.200 --> 02:33:02.923]  I got medically discharged from the military because I claimed that the World Trade Center 1, 2, and 7 were destroyed by explosives that were planted in the buildings beforehand, and I was medically discharged for being paranoid delusional, and I had shared psychosis with Alex Jones, and you begged me to send you the, fax you the information, but I don't have your fax number.
[02:33:03.740 --> 02:33:09.625]  And if I can get your fax number, I can send it to you.
[02:33:10.726 --> 02:33:15.970]  You can send it to 512-291-5787.
[02:33:16.530 --> 02:33:20.093]  Folks, do not call that number and do not send me 100 page faxes.
[02:33:20.133 --> 02:33:21.114]  I'm going to get really mad.
[02:33:21.814 --> 02:33:25.197]  Please, please just send two or three page faxes.
[02:33:25.217 --> 02:33:25.257]  512-291-5787.
[02:33:25.557 --> 02:33:29.821]  Listen, send me info, send me your name.
[02:33:29.841 --> 02:33:31.502]  We'll vet what you're doing and get you on as a guest.
[02:33:31.542 --> 02:33:32.383]  I appreciate you calling.
[02:33:33.917 --> 02:33:35.017]  Very, very interesting.
[02:33:37.138 --> 02:33:43.541]  They have had torture training forever, but they would cover it under the guise of what you're going to have happen to you under torture, and they admit, no, this is your torture training.
[02:33:44.461 --> 02:33:54.144]  I have him on about once a month, and so much is going on that he always gets on and talks about preparedness, instead of telling you how to actually call him and get prepared.
[02:33:54.285 --> 02:34:00.707]  I want Steve to just tell you about his great products and why you need to get prepared,
[02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:09.803]  With the economy and everything that's happening, you know, cash your money into real gold, silver, cash it into real food before it's devalued.
[02:34:10.304 --> 02:34:13.685]  And in the Great Depression, 80% of the country was rural.
[02:34:15.126 --> 02:34:16.226]  80% of the country was rural.
[02:34:17.166 --> 02:34:19.407]  And we had trouble feeding ourselves, but we were able to.
[02:34:20.007 --> 02:34:22.769]  Now, 90% is urban in the cities.
[02:34:23.569 --> 02:34:28.731]  And the 10% or so that's in the country, very few of those are sustaining themselves and sustainable.
[02:34:29.783 --> 02:34:32.964]  Again, ants save food.
[02:34:33.164 --> 02:34:34.464]  Squirrels save food.
[02:34:36.305 --> 02:34:37.645]  Wolves save food.
[02:34:37.725 --> 02:34:39.006]  Bury bones, bury meat.
[02:34:40.046 --> 02:34:43.247]  I don't know where your instincts gone, but I'm telling you, you need to get your instincts.
[02:34:43.267 --> 02:34:44.567]  Stop drinking their poison water.
[02:34:45.107 --> 02:34:47.768]  Have at least two months supply for each member of your family, bare minimum.
[02:34:47.788 --> 02:34:49.248]  You need a year's supply for each person.
[02:34:49.969 --> 02:34:50.929]  That really is the minimum.
[02:34:51.609 --> 02:34:55.050]  But whatever you can afford, this is very inexpensive for what you get.
[02:34:56.125 --> 02:34:59.228]  And compared to what you spend at the grocery store, it's a fraction.
[02:35:00.048 --> 02:35:11.737]  So I wanted to get Steve Shank, the longest continual operating purple foods company in the nation, almost 27 years, the J. Michael Stevens Group, huge banners on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[02:35:11.757 --> 02:35:17.262]  And I also want to thank Steve for his great sponsorship that really makes so much of what we do here possible.
[02:35:17.282 --> 02:35:18.403]  So he's also a great sponsor.
[02:35:18.423 --> 02:35:22.506]  And I want to thank you, the listeners, that have been responding and getting prepared and ready, because that feels good.
[02:35:22.546 --> 02:35:23.907]  We try to get you to buy firearms,
[02:35:25.083 --> 02:35:26.004]  Great to be aboard, Alex.
[02:35:52.803 --> 02:36:07.831]  I'm really excited about what we're doing because we just got hit in the forehead with a 2x4 this last week with regard to price increases and things as a result of this dadgum stupid foolishness of them turning our food into fuel.
[02:36:09.657 --> 02:36:11.999]  It's absolutely nuts.
[02:36:12.479 --> 02:36:25.565]  You were mentioning to the folks just before you brought me on here that it's a fraction of the percentage of the amount of cost that they spend at the grocery store.
[02:36:26.645 --> 02:36:33.268]  What we're going to do here is we're going to make things better because we've got just a couple of months.
[02:36:33.668 --> 02:36:36.870]  We've got November and we've got December.
[02:36:37.927 --> 02:36:45.653]  Before I believe that the turn of the year, we're going to see some horrendous increases in prices.
[02:36:46.173 --> 02:36:52.718]  I'm not saying that, but the federal government is, and so is the UN head of the food program is saying global food riots.
[02:36:52.758 --> 02:36:55.200]  Now, folks, that's not why you should get food.
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:56.601]  I don't know if that's going to happen.
[02:36:56.621 --> 02:36:58.342]  The point is we're in very uncertain times.
[02:36:58.683 --> 02:37:01.605]  This stuff lasts for 10 years, longer if stored properly.
[02:37:02.265 --> 02:37:04.266]  But what we've done is we've put together a new unit, Alex.
[02:37:21.096 --> 02:37:23.138]  We just finished this up last night.
[02:37:24.158 --> 02:37:36.145]  I want your listeners that have email access or website access in about an hour to go up on efoodsdirect.com and they're going to look for the holiday unit.
[02:37:36.926 --> 02:37:49.453]  What we've done is we've combined a full year supply of food that's just as powerful as the ones that you've got and we've added to it a one month grab-and-go pack that has a hundred and fifteen meals ready to go in it.
[02:37:50.260 --> 02:37:52.882]  And that is one unit that we're putting together.
[02:37:53.463 --> 02:37:58.727]  And we're putting that together at a cost that's less than one one-year supply used to be.
[02:37:58.747 --> 02:38:08.154]  And the reason we're doing this is we got hit with unbelievable price increases that are going to start as of the first of the year.
[02:38:08.474 --> 02:38:12.638]  We've already got inventory in that we're going to fill these orders with.
[02:38:13.238 --> 02:38:14.199]  Now here's the deal.
[02:38:14.459 --> 02:38:16.100]  Folks, listen very carefully.
[02:38:16.701 --> 02:38:18.022]  You're going to have to call in
[02:38:18.983 --> 02:38:19.944]  We're good to go.
[02:38:34.194 --> 02:38:40.399]  And have us send you an order form and the information that explains what this is.
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:55.292]  This is going to be extremely economical and the reason for that is we have to get, Alex, we have to get as many people with food in from the inventories that we've already bought into the warehouse.
[02:38:56.036 --> 02:39:10.589]  Because when we have to buy new food as of the first of the year The costs are going to be absolutely ridiculous and some items are not going to be there And the reason for it is turning all of our animal feed into fuel.
[02:39:11.049 --> 02:39:14.633]  It's the dumbest stinking thing in the world I could spend an hour and a half on it.
[02:39:14.673 --> 02:39:18.376]  Maybe we ought to sometime for your listeners, but the fact is that
[02:39:19.452 --> 02:39:20.873]  We're good to go.
[02:39:38.212 --> 02:40:05.821]  of groceries for feeding adult for a year and on top of it there's a one-month grab-and-go kit that is more phenomenal than anything that's ever been out there available and the reason we did this Alex is very simple the folks that have have a little bit of money right now are going to be able to get food but they've got to get the food in while it's available it's disappearing and they've got to get in while they can still afford it
[02:40:06.591 --> 02:40:25.587]  I'm absolutely convinced that by the third month of this coming year, even before they come up with a stupid ID card, there will be about a third of the families in this country that will not be able to afford putting in a supply of food.
[02:40:25.627 --> 02:40:30.712]  Well, I saw a CNBC report that people are already buying less food, which is a staple.
[02:40:30.772 --> 02:40:32.814]  That shows how bad the economy is.
[02:40:33.754 --> 02:40:38.738]  Gold is at over $807 an ounce right now.
[02:40:38.978 --> 02:40:46.584]  Folks, while the dollar still has some value, there's no doubt food prices are going up regardless, and they are announcing food shortages in the media.
[02:40:46.765 --> 02:40:47.945]  Again, it's all insane.
[02:40:48.866 --> 02:40:50.147]  Just give them a call.
[02:40:50.187 --> 02:40:50.948]  Give them the number, Steve.
[02:40:51.488 --> 02:40:51.628]  It's 800-409-5633.
[02:40:55.952 --> 02:40:58.353]  800-409-5633.
[02:40:59.554 --> 02:41:01.835]  We'll get you information on this special pack.
[02:41:01.915 --> 02:41:03.936]  It's cheaper than anything you've ever got before.
[02:41:03.996 --> 02:41:06.378]  It's going to give you a chance to stock up.
[02:41:07.218 --> 02:41:11.140]  But if you don't have this done by the first of the year, you're going to be in serious trouble.
[02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:12.821]  Now, we can get it shipped out.
[02:41:12.881 --> 02:41:21.826]  If you get your orders in by November 21st, they will be shipped and delivered to you or your loved ones by Christmas.
[02:41:22.747 --> 02:41:24.448]  If you don't make that deadline,
[02:41:25.313 --> 02:41:32.419]  Go for December 20th, and anything that you get in by December 20th, you'll get a certificate out there.
[02:41:32.439 --> 02:41:33.560]  You can give them for Christmas.
[02:41:34.060 --> 02:41:42.067]  But by the end of December, all of the food that we've bought into the warehouse on the previous pricing will be gone.
[02:41:42.127 --> 02:41:46.230]  We've got the capacity for about 823 units.
[02:41:46.850 --> 02:41:54.657]  Get those orders out, and after that, we're going to have to buy new food at the new prices, and it's going to be... Give them the number again.
[02:41:55.177 --> 02:41:55.558]  We're good to go.
[02:42:12.421 --> 02:42:13.061]  We're good to go!
[02:42:38.773 --> 02:42:39.574]  We're good to go.
[02:42:52.310 --> 02:43:04.715]  The dollar is in free fall by design, and I give you the advice, and I bring you the sponsors that I get water filters from, that I get storable foods from, that I get gold from.
[02:43:05.336 --> 02:43:06.736]  We don't have any firearm sponsors.
[02:43:06.856 --> 02:43:10.218]  I wish we did, but I believe you need those too, and I need to know how to use them.
[02:43:11.318 --> 02:43:17.081]  I've told you, if you go out and buy four or five acres of scrub brush near water, but I've got a lot of money to get that.
[02:43:17.876 --> 02:43:26.043]  If you've got to live in the city, have someplace you can get to, have an old RV, have just the basic stuff in case society completely unravels.
[02:43:26.403 --> 02:43:36.371]  Because if we do have a massive depression, folks, and I'm hoping this doesn't happen, but you said there's a 20% chance we go to a war with Iran, 20% chance we have a depression, 20% chance we have a food shortage.
[02:43:36.391 --> 02:43:43.496]  You start adding all these different crises together, you get up to 80-90% chance of serious stuff happening in the next year or even sooner.
[02:43:44.537 --> 02:43:45.517]  Yeah, even the mainstream media.
[02:43:45.537 --> 02:43:48.559]  They've got federal billboards up saying, get prepared, store food.
[02:43:49.059 --> 02:43:50.440]  But they say, store a week of food.
[02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:51.240]  It's a joke!
[02:43:51.700 --> 02:43:53.781]  So they can say, oh, we warned you.
[02:43:54.722 --> 02:43:58.904]  Bottom line, folks, bottom line, there's radio, TV ads where they're saying this.
[02:43:59.124 --> 02:44:01.665]  They sell these junk survival things that are worthless.
[02:44:02.265 --> 02:44:04.707]  It is a complete joke.
[02:44:04.827 --> 02:44:11.290]  And a smart mammal, a smart insect, a smart squirrel gets prepared.
[02:44:11.310 --> 02:44:13.671]  And all I'm saying is, you're not living in fear.
[02:44:14.617 --> 02:44:15.817]  We're not running for the hills.
[02:44:16.358 --> 02:44:19.819]  We're getting prepared for tough times.
[02:44:20.639 --> 02:44:26.981]  And again, it is so important for you to get prepared and get prepared now.
[02:44:27.761 --> 02:44:30.622]  And it is so important for you to stop waiting.
[02:44:31.343 --> 02:44:41.906]  In just a few minutes we've got left, Steve, tell them specifically what is in that holiday special unit, a one-year supply and then this boogie pack for one person for a month that comes with it.
[02:44:42.206 --> 02:44:43.947]  Tell them what's in those, what they get.
[02:44:44.508 --> 02:44:52.653]  Well, what you've got is all the fruits and vegetables, dairy products, all of this stuff is put up exactly the way you would get it if you got it out of the garden.
[02:44:52.673 --> 02:44:54.174]  The only difference is it's dried.
[02:44:54.675 --> 02:44:59.678]  When you add the water back to it, then you cook with it just like you do straight out of the garden.
[02:44:59.698 --> 02:45:01.079]  You use your recipes and stuff.
[02:45:01.479 --> 02:45:04.441]  This is not goofy food like most of the survival junk.
[02:45:04.861 --> 02:45:09.345]  This is not the soybean protein reconstituted.
[02:45:09.685 --> 02:45:10.546]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:45:11.046 --> 02:45:18.232]  And it's not MREs that have digestive enzymes and junk like that in them.
[02:45:18.252 --> 02:45:21.695]  But what we tried to do with this one, this is a modified one.
[02:45:21.755 --> 02:45:24.417]  This is the most powerful unit of food.
[02:45:24.477 --> 02:45:34.425]  When you put the one-year supply, it replaces $2,500 worth of groceries, and it does that at less than 50% of the cost of groceries.
[02:45:34.935 --> 02:45:39.620]  People who are broke and already in trouble are putting these things in and using them.
[02:45:40.061 --> 02:45:42.803]  And the grab-and-run thing, that's a one-month supply.
[02:45:43.244 --> 02:45:45.706]  It's half of what we did for the Patriot Pack.
[02:45:46.047 --> 02:45:48.590]  But this thing, one case with 115
[02:45:50.459 --> 02:45:51.300]  We're good to go.
[02:46:05.399 --> 02:46:05.759]  I think so.
[02:46:21.975 --> 02:46:23.276]  It's a KD bar the door.
[02:46:23.716 --> 02:46:28.958]  I need to tell you sometime, I'll get you some live reads with regard to this ethanol thing.
[02:46:29.298 --> 02:46:30.919]  It's absolutely horrendous, Alex.
[02:46:31.239 --> 02:46:33.460]  You have no idea what it's doing.
[02:46:33.520 --> 02:46:41.864]  So the UN's actually right about this, where they said it's horrible that from Africa to Brazil to the US that they destroyed the food crop for the animals and the humans.
[02:46:41.924 --> 02:46:42.484]  It's that big?
[02:46:43.144 --> 02:46:44.765]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:46:45.505 --> 02:46:55.669]  This thing hit so hard, we got a notice from our supplier last Wednesday, just a couple days ago, and they told us what was going on.
[02:46:56.049 --> 02:47:07.294]  Iowa, just to give you an idea real quickly, Iowa produces 20% of all the corn in this country, and as a result of rolling all of that animal feed, which is our food,
[02:47:09.896 --> 02:47:28.381]  As a result of rolling all of the animal feed over and turning it into this stupid fuel that it takes a gallon and a half of petroleum to produce one gallon of this crap, they are going to have to import corn into Iowa that produces 20% of our corn for this country.
[02:47:29.028 --> 02:47:33.211]  They're going to have to import corn to Iowa because they've thwarted all of the seed and fuel that's used in Iowa.
[02:47:59.268 --> 02:47:59.908]  Yeah.
[02:47:59.968 --> 02:48:02.109]  On the Grab and Go Packs, they're 150% meals.
[02:48:02.129 --> 02:48:03.789]  They're full 16 ounces of food.
[02:48:03.989 --> 02:48:06.790]  And most people can't eat the whole meal.
[02:48:25.203 --> 02:48:30.847]  800-409-5633 and on the web at efoodsdirected.com.
[02:48:31.307 --> 02:48:32.428]  Alex, I appreciate you.
[02:48:33.088 --> 02:48:35.350]  I appreciate you and the good work you're doing, Steve Schenck.
[02:48:35.390 --> 02:48:36.390]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:48:36.411 --> 02:48:39.693]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:39.953 --> 02:48:40.873]  A new world order.
[02:48:40.933 --> 02:48:43.235]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by power.
[02:48:54.446 --> 02:48:56.148]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:48:56.508 --> 02:48:59.511]  Is that their objective, being world domination?
[02:49:00.031 --> 02:49:02.493]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:03.214 --> 02:49:10.540]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:13.573 --> 02:49:18.556]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:19.036 --> 02:49:22.518]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:22.879 --> 02:49:25.400]  Bill of Rights is making great progress in order world government.
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:26.421]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:26.441 --> 02:49:27.341]  They're not after money.
[02:49:27.381 --> 02:49:28.462]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:28.682 --> 02:49:29.442]  They're after power.
[02:49:29.663 --> 02:49:30.683]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[02:50:44.022 --> 02:50:47.343]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN Financial Bulletin.
[02:50:47.663 --> 02:50:52.665]  Have you ever wanted to make a lot of extra cash in a way that requires very little money to get started?
[02:50:53.065 --> 02:50:58.227]  If so, and you have a high-speed internet connection, this may well be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:50:58.447 --> 02:50:59.027]  Here's why.
[02:50:59.227 --> 02:51:07.210]  You can now get a free DVD that reveals how to make more money than any sane person can possibly spend, and do it while working part-time at home.
[02:51:07.210 --> 02:51:07.771]  I think so.
[02:51:27.381 --> 02:51:27.961]  I think so.
[02:51:56.540 --> 02:52:02.523]  You know, I meant to spend more time on this today, but there's a big article up there about these super mice.
[02:52:03.984 --> 02:52:06.965]  Eat half as much, run twice as far, live longer.
[02:52:08.726 --> 02:52:10.547]  Oh yeah, that's the life extension right there.
[02:52:12.548 --> 02:52:14.489]  And I want to jam in some final phone calls.
[02:52:14.609 --> 02:52:18.912]  I just hope you will go to eFoodsDirect.com or call 800-409-5633 like you heard Steve Schenck just talking about.
[02:52:18.932 --> 02:52:19.252]  In this news,
[02:52:25.541 --> 02:52:28.583]  Britain's colossal food waste is stoking climate change.
[02:52:28.603 --> 02:52:33.086]  See, this is how they get us ready to consume less and have higher taxes and be under more control.
[02:52:33.126 --> 02:52:35.987]  They said 50 years ago they were going to lower our standard through this.
[02:52:36.007 --> 02:52:36.948]  This is feudalism.
[02:52:37.448 --> 02:52:44.252]  London Independent today, Britain's must swap their wasteful habits with food for the thrifty approach of previous generations by buying less and eating leftovers.
[02:52:44.572 --> 02:52:47.174]  And the UK is to play its part in reverting climate change.
[02:52:47.654 --> 02:52:48.995]  Shoppers were warned yesterday.
[02:52:49.682 --> 02:52:53.426]  The call for a cultural move against overt shopping was made by Joan Ruddock.
[02:52:53.707 --> 02:52:55.909]  See, all sounds reasonable, but it's government control.
[02:52:56.249 --> 02:53:03.357]  The Environment Minister, after research showed Britons threw away one-third of their food, an enormous hidden financial and environmental cost.
[02:53:03.958 --> 02:53:08.383]  Annually, the UK dumps 6.7 million tons, meaning each household
[02:53:09.565 --> 02:53:14.927]  Jettison between 250 pounds and 400 pounds worth of food each year.
[02:53:15.087 --> 02:53:22.850]  Most waste, which nationally costs $8 billion, is sent to landfill where it rots, emitting the potent climate change gas, methane!
[02:53:23.150 --> 02:53:25.171]  We gotta ban the cow's food because they flatulent!
[02:53:25.731 --> 02:53:27.912]  It's just unbelievable micromanagement.
[02:53:28.232 --> 02:53:31.373]  Global warming bill advances in the Senate.
[02:53:32.014 --> 02:53:36.335]  Associated Press lawmakers took the first step Thursday on a bipartisan global warming bill.
[02:53:36.595 --> 02:53:38.196]  That's a taxation bill, boys and girls.
[02:53:39.813 --> 02:53:44.636]  It would impose mandatory cuts in greenhouse gases from power plants, industrial landfills, and transportation.
[02:53:44.656 --> 02:53:47.457]  We're just shutting down coal plants, saying carbon dioxide is deadly.
[02:53:48.238 --> 02:54:00.145]  Senator Joe Lieberman pushed legislation out of the Global Warming Subcommittee, the Global Warming Subcommittee, and it said, agreed to a number of changes aimed permanently at garnering the needed majority to advance it.
[02:54:01.105 --> 02:54:03.787]  I mean, it says they're probably going to pass the Kyoto here!
[02:54:04.327 --> 02:54:07.769]  All these new taxes, how big your house can be, all these new controls,
[02:54:09.409 --> 02:54:18.892]  And they passed the Lost Treaty, Law of the Sea Treaty, out of the Senate, and it's going to go to the House.
[02:54:18.932 --> 02:54:20.773]  I mean, it's all happening right now.
[02:54:20.873 --> 02:54:21.874]  It's all happening.
[02:54:21.894 --> 02:54:23.034]  They're moving against us.
[02:54:24.859 --> 02:54:32.146]  Unbelievable that all of this is going on, and all we're trying to do is to get people to realize that this is the globalist engineering.
[02:54:32.326 --> 02:54:36.770]  All of this, that we do have environmental problems, but it's not carbon dioxide.
[02:54:36.990 --> 02:54:38.351]  The plants breathe that.
[02:54:38.631 --> 02:54:40.233]  That is a life-giving gas.
[02:54:40.393 --> 02:54:41.454]  It is ridiculous.
[02:54:41.894 --> 02:54:45.918]  All the genetic engineering and the other bad things they're doing, but we shouldn't worry about that.
[02:54:47.159 --> 02:54:51.563]  We should just tax what humans exhale.
[02:54:51.883 --> 02:54:53.565]  You know, I don't think I'll have time to go to your calls.
[02:54:53.625 --> 02:54:54.706]  We're just out of time.
[02:54:54.746 --> 02:55:00.371]  I apologize to John and John and Nick and everybody else, but call me back Sunday 4 or 6 p.m.
[02:55:00.431 --> 02:55:03.534]  or call me Monday back live and I'll put you to the head of the line.

[02:55:28.242 --> 02:55:35.531]  We have been taking on more sponsors so we can have bigger websites, better streams, more information, try to pay our people better here so we can just survive.
