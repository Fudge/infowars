[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:00.429]  Five.
[00:00:02.812 --> 00:00:07.175]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio interview.
[00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:08.877]  Scream like no other.
[00:00:09.097 --> 00:00:11.900]  Strap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:14.262]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:15.643 --> 00:00:17.485]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:20.387]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:20.868 --> 00:00:23.630]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.353]  Call Alex now, toll free.
[00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:44.904]  Thank you so much for joining us for this Sunday syndicated broadcast.
[00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:48.326]  We'll be live here for the next two hours till 6 p.m.
[00:00:48.746 --> 00:00:50.827]  Central Standard Time, 7 p.m.
[00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.449]  Pacific, 5 o'clock Mountain, 4 p.m.
[00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:53.829]  Pacific.
[00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:02.036]  And we're going to have wide open phones throughout the transmission.
[00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:07.681]  The toll free number to join us is 877-590-5525 or locally in Central Texas.
[00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:14.106]  If you're listening to us out of the station that we transmit from, that this broadcast originates from, 836-0590 for KLVJ 590 AM.
[00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:17.569]  Alright, here are the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 stacks of news I have in front of me.
[00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:29.492]  One is all the new 9-11 inside job developments.
[00:01:30.492 --> 00:01:34.073]  I'm from Rosie O'Donnell announcing that she's going to leave The View this week.
[00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:35.213]  What's really behind that?
[00:01:35.773 --> 00:01:42.355]  To John Kerry last Sunday being here in Austin, Texas and talking about Building 7 being a controlled demolition.
[00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:45.816]  We'll be covering that later in the second hour.
[00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:54.438]  In the first hour, the Wall Street Journal has reported, as well as the Associated Press, Yahoo News, and Reuters,
[00:01:55.197 --> 00:02:05.404]  that global warming could be halted by government weather control and then they go on to admit chemtrails or aerosol spraying in the skies.
[00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:08.166]  Oh my goodness!
[00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:10.447]  Huge developments.
[00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:12.469]  We'll be going over that for you.
[00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:18.893]  Also how the whole global warming movement, man-made global warming movement, is nothing but a push for taxation.
[00:02:18.913 --> 00:02:19.814]  In fact, I have
[00:02:20.547 --> 00:02:31.876]  Up on the screen in front of me, the Weather Channel, and I've been sitting here for about 45 minutes getting ready, and I've seen already two news reports on global warming and how we must have a global tax to save us from it.
[00:02:33.157 --> 00:02:45.366]  So we'll talk about what's really behind the endless hype for man-made global warming and how even the supposed solution to it, if you even believe it's man-made, which of course it isn't, is a fraud.
[00:02:46.517 --> 00:03:00.021]  It is the dream of the New World Order for over a century to have a world tax, and they need a crisis, some way to get the public ninnying and rubbing their hands together, and climactic climate change is going to be their main mode.
[00:03:00.081 --> 00:03:03.762]  That and the war on terror and several other big fear-mongering issues.
[00:03:05.522 --> 00:03:10.924]  Also, Bush is now yet again pushing total blanket, complete amnesty for all illegal aliens in the country.
[00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:16.057]  And they then have the liberal shills come out and protest against it.
[00:03:16.097 --> 00:03:24.701]  That then fools conservatives, it's all staged, into thinking that Bush is actually for national sovereignty and for controlling our borders.
[00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:33.145]  And when you see Bush on CNN or Fox or hear him on the radio, and I've been monitoring the news this weekend, they come out and say, Bush wants to get tough on illegal immigration!
[00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:36.366]  You'll hear a clip of the President saying, it's time to do something about it!
[00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:38.307]  Everybody knows it's broken!
[00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:41.263]  His answer would be like if you had a leg chopped off.
[00:03:41.723 --> 00:03:42.484]  You're bleeding to death.
[00:03:42.524 --> 00:03:43.985]  His answer is not put a tourniquet on it.
[00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:46.926]  It's chop the other leg off and cut your head off while it's at it.
[00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:49.648]  But again, they have the general public completely dumbed down.
[00:03:49.748 --> 00:03:51.909]  Just here's the slogans and the terms.
[00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:52.709]  Total deception.
[00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.611]  But we'll go over what's really happening with that.
[00:03:57.312 --> 00:04:00.093]  The euro rises to record high versus the dollar.
[00:04:00.193 --> 00:04:06.737]  It's never, no currency has never been in the last hundred years this strong against the dollar.
[00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:08.650]  The dollar is tanking.
[00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.033]  Last week it went down a cent a day.
[00:04:13.074 --> 00:04:15.536]  That is massive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:15.896 --> 00:04:23.343]  The slide is now straight down, and we will break down exactly what that means and how it dovetails with economic growth.
[00:04:23.943 --> 00:04:25.765]  In the first quarter, it slows to 1.3%.
[00:04:25.985 --> 00:04:31.269]  If you understand that inflation is actually at over 10% right now.
[00:04:31.329 --> 00:04:32.470]  I know the official number says 4.5%, but
[00:04:34.384 --> 00:04:36.325]  The official number also says unemployment is at 3%.
[00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:41.328]  Because they don't count you once you've been off the rolls for six months.
[00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:44.811]  So we'll talk about some of the real economic information.
[00:04:45.171 --> 00:04:50.135]  Also big-time war propaganda right now to keep the Iraq war going.
[00:04:50.455 --> 00:05:00.182]  The Democrats are involved in ultra-massive dog and pony shows right now convincing the public and the planet
[00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:01.967]  I think so.
[00:05:21.897 --> 00:05:24.859]  Let me tell you the other bit of news I have for you.
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.561]  It's a large stack.
[00:05:26.961 --> 00:05:29.503]  This is just stuff that happened in the last week.
[00:05:29.543 --> 00:05:31.865]  In fact, some of it just came out in the last two days.
[00:05:32.846 --> 00:05:36.729]  And we'll be covering this pretty much exclusively, that and 9-11.
[00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:49.139]  In the second hour today, about two weeks ago, almost two weeks ago, Luke Radowski, who is a reporter for PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv,
[00:05:50.672 --> 00:05:57.598]  He called into the end of the show, but was unable to get on air, my weekday show that I did a syndicated show with him for 10 years now, or 9 years.
[00:05:58.538 --> 00:06:06.725]  And he called in and he said that he had been detained for an hour and had his camera and phone taken, but they called him a terrorist.
[00:06:06.845 --> 00:06:12.850]  And then I was busy with other projects, didn't get to watching the video, once he uploaded it a few days later to YouTube.
[00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.993]  And then I went out of town and into business in Los Angeles.
[00:06:18.032 --> 00:06:21.993]  And I just got back the other night and saw this and it completely freaked me out.
[00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:30.434]  I've never seen anything this bad dealing with the police state in America and the total Sovietization of our society.
[00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:34.235]  And that video is up on PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com.
[00:06:34.575 --> 00:06:36.535]  Easiest place to find it is JonesReport.com.
[00:06:36.575 --> 00:06:40.316]  It's been up now for about three days and still up on the main page.
[00:06:40.556 --> 00:06:41.856]  Front and center, you can't miss it.
[00:06:42.356 --> 00:06:44.397]  That headline, and it's all on video.
[00:06:44.597 --> 00:06:46.057]  Now see what's scary about this is
[00:06:46.736 --> 00:06:51.680]  The cops, we know mafia type police in major cities have been doing this for a long time.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.321]  Seventy, eighty years.
[00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:55.763]  But they never did it on video before.
[00:06:56.243 --> 00:06:57.204]  It's kind of like FEMA.
[00:06:57.244 --> 00:07:01.407]  I have FEMA on tape saying all Christians are terrorists, gun owners are terrorists.
[00:07:02.032 --> 00:07:04.012]  Anyone who's for private property or terrorists.
[00:07:04.052 --> 00:07:05.353]  This is all intensified under Bush.
[00:07:05.393 --> 00:07:07.093]  You'd think it's under Hillary and Bill.
[00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:09.453]  And it was badder to them, but it's gotten far worse.
[00:07:09.493 --> 00:07:13.014]  It's all part of... It's just lip service when they tell you they're Christian, folks.
[00:07:13.034 --> 00:07:17.695]  The real enemy, though, is Christians because they know you won't play ball with their New World Order.
[00:07:18.555 --> 00:07:21.916]  We're trying to pacify you just long enough until you find out about it.
[00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:27.077]  But this new video I have... Now, understand, I have video in Philadelphia in 2004
[00:07:29.131 --> 00:07:41.519]  Of Christians at an outfest, a public event in the city, praying on a street corner and being arrested by Homeland Security and charged with 47 years in prison apiece, that got national attention and they were acquitted.
[00:07:41.739 --> 00:07:42.519]  But it went to trial.
[00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.801]  Praying now, like China, gets you 47 years.
[00:07:45.821 --> 00:07:46.862]  So they tried 47 years.
[00:07:47.482 --> 00:07:51.825]  But at least the police were solemn and businesslike in their criminal activities.
[00:07:52.518 --> 00:07:57.399]  This new one, everyone who sees it, I just showed it to my wife the other day and I said, tell me what you think of this.
[00:07:57.439 --> 00:08:00.300]  She goes, oh my god, they're like mafia out of a movie.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.842]  I show it to everybody before they've ever heard my comments and they say, oh my god, it's like the Sopranos.
[00:08:06.582 --> 00:08:10.963]  You've got five or six 9-11 troopers standing in front of Ground Zero.
[00:08:11.443 --> 00:08:13.083]  It's Silverstein Properties, the new Building 7.
[00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:18.525]  And up walks, well you see on camera three different cops, but really six
[00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:23.996]  Plainclothes, in suits, in black trench coats, men announcing themselves as police officers.
[00:08:24.336 --> 00:08:27.298]  And they were commanding plainclothes officers later, so they must be officers.
[00:08:28.158 --> 00:08:31.981]  And they say, we know you're not terrorists, but we're going to say you are and put you in jail.
[00:08:33.021 --> 00:08:35.403]  I mean, this is on video, with their faces up close.
[00:08:35.923 --> 00:08:39.686]  I mean, this is hardcore federal and state crimes being committed on video.
[00:08:39.746 --> 00:08:41.547]  In fact, we have links to federal and state law.
[00:08:41.847 --> 00:08:43.128]  New York law, I went and pulled it up.
[00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:46.370]  I contributed to this article as we were writing it Friday night.
[00:08:47.435 --> 00:08:47.896]  At midnight.
[00:08:47.936 --> 00:08:49.137]  We posted it at about midnight.
[00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:50.839]  I'm just proud of the fact that we do work hard.
[00:08:51.219 --> 00:08:55.123]  There's all these other truthers and other people out there that wonder why we're so successful in fighting the globalists.
[00:08:55.443 --> 00:08:59.988]  It's because we don't go to a lot of movies and a lot of bars and sit around and suck our thumbs all day.
[00:09:00.368 --> 00:09:03.912]  We're actually working all the time because we know how serious the new world order is.
[00:09:05.173 --> 00:09:10.816]  If other people want to help defeat the New World Order and take down the New World Order, you'll start getting involved and working hard, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:11.077 --> 00:09:11.897]  That's what it's going to take.
[00:09:11.937 --> 00:09:13.658]  But here's the headline.
[00:09:13.718 --> 00:09:18.402]  New York Police Report Bomb to Frame Activist as a Terrorist.
[00:09:19.983 --> 00:09:20.683]  Let me say that again.
[00:09:21.183 --> 00:09:24.726]  New York City Police on videotape report bomb.
[00:09:24.746 --> 00:09:28.388]  I mean, they call in a bomb to frame activists as terrorists.
[00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:33.032]  By the time the government finds out, you'll be in the hole 30 days.
[00:09:34.292 --> 00:09:34.992]  That's what the cop said.
[00:09:35.012 --> 00:09:39.733]  9-11 Truthers told by officer admits the false accusation of having a bomb.
[00:09:40.473 --> 00:09:42.814]  That's coming up in the second hour.
[00:09:43.894 --> 00:09:50.475]  But first we'll go through the economy, the war, chemtrails, weather modification, Wall Street Journal.
[00:09:50.935 --> 00:09:51.835]  It's all coming up.
[00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:52.955]  Keep it locked in.
[00:10:04.082 --> 00:10:07.326]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:10:07.627 --> 00:10:09.569]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:17.599]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:18.283 --> 00:10:25.345]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:25.745 --> 00:10:37.149]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:10:37.469 --> 00:10:40.990]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.371]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:10:43.691 --> 00:10:47.532]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:03.331]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:11:03.611 --> 00:11:06.234]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:11:06.554 --> 00:11:14.862]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:11:15.162 --> 00:11:17.984]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:11:18.825 --> 00:11:22.048]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:11:23.369 --> 00:11:24.931]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:11:25.331 --> 00:11:26.252]  Take action now!
[00:11:26.392 --> 00:11:30.855]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:11:31.196 --> 00:11:34.978]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:11:35.179 --> 00:11:38.401]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:44.946]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:50.252]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:11:51.193 --> 00:11:53.336]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[00:11:53.536 --> 00:11:55.238]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[00:12:02.546 --> 00:12:04.347]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:12:04.647 --> 00:12:07.488]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[00:12:07.988 --> 00:12:10.189]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:19.113]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[00:12:19.593 --> 00:12:20.133]  An example?
[00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:23.515]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[00:12:24.395 --> 00:12:27.156]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[00:12:27.537 --> 00:12:30.798]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[00:12:31.576 --> 00:12:36.760]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[00:12:37.401 --> 00:12:38.862]  Money is not the problem.
[00:12:39.102 --> 00:12:40.083]  Availability is.
[00:12:40.623 --> 00:12:43.506]  Be careful when food supplies get short, with no future.
[00:12:44.006 --> 00:12:46.408]  Many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[00:12:47.008 --> 00:12:49.110]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.

[00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.152]  Exposing corruption.
[00:14:15.192 --> 00:14:18.615]  Dismantling a false left-right paradigm.
[00:14:18.675 --> 00:14:21.758]  He's Alex Jones.
[00:14:21.858 --> 00:14:22.519]  Welcome back.
[00:14:22.599 --> 00:14:24.080]  It is Sunday, the 29th of April, 2007.
[00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:30.937]  Can you believe that we are already about to enter the midway point of 2007?
[00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:35.279]  I mean, my God!
[00:14:35.379 --> 00:14:39.301]  It seems like I'm just 15 years old yesterday, and I'm this old man.
[00:14:41.663 --> 00:14:44.564]  All right, your calls are coming up in the next segment at 877-590-5525.
[00:14:44.744 --> 00:14:52.028]  Let me just get into this first, because on Thursday and Friday I mentioned it on my weekday show.
[00:14:52.068 --> 00:14:55.190]  I never even covered it, and it is really, really important.
[00:14:55.982 --> 00:15:08.867]  This is the Wall Street Journal that I hold here in my hand, and the headline is, Global Warming, Could Global Warming be Halted by Controlling the Weather?
[00:15:10.268 --> 00:15:19.891]  And it says, Frustrated with the limits of public policy to tackle global warming, some scientists say the time has come to engineer a way to control the weather.
[00:15:20.312 --> 00:15:23.973]  The idea might seem appealing, says a science scholar.
[00:15:25.248 --> 00:15:39.780]  And it goes on, one idea put forth by a physicist involved in climate control discussions would involve bombarding the Arctic atmosphere with specially engineered particles to deflect the sun's rays, thereby lowering temperatures.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:45.124]  Alternatively, a fleet of crop-dusting airplanes could deliver the particles by
[00:15:45.928 --> 00:15:48.309]  Flying continuously around the Arctic Circle.
[00:15:48.709 --> 00:15:54.110]  An astronomer suggested placing a huge fleet of mirrors in orbit to divert solar radiation.
[00:15:54.510 --> 00:16:01.951]  Some of these ideas, say Mr. Fleming, are reminiscent of the optimism that framed the first attempts at climate control.
[00:16:02.471 --> 00:16:03.332]  And then it goes on.
[00:16:04.452 --> 00:16:05.872]  Okay, let's just stop right there.
[00:16:06.032 --> 00:16:11.293]  Number one, they talk about frustration with the limits of public policy to tackle global warming.
[00:16:12.114 --> 00:16:14.214]  The Earth is always heating up and cooling down.
[00:16:15.361 --> 00:16:27.686]  All of the major studies show that a heating factor would actually increase the green belts across the planet, the growth belts, and create more oxygen and carbon dioxide for plankton in the oceans.
[00:16:28.607 --> 00:16:34.869]  A higher carbon dioxide atmosphere increases the amount of oxygen in a symbiotic relationship between plant and animal.
[00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.611]  I mean, I'm actually weird enough that I stood around reading long
[00:16:39.251 --> 00:16:46.577]  You know, climate studies and studies on plant growth with higher carbon dioxide and things of this nature.
[00:16:47.158 --> 00:16:53.463]  And I actually read what the real scientists and real institutions are saying and they're saying man-made global warming is a complete and total hoax.
[00:16:54.315 --> 00:17:09.566]  In fact, we have scientists unified on this, almost completely unified, but then on the other side, you hear the media, the UN, the federal government, European government saying, every scientist agrees, massive man-made global warming, the end is near.
[00:17:11.167 --> 00:17:17.411]  Then they show polar bears and saying, look at them, they can't swim, their ice cap is melting, they're going to die.
[00:17:17.431 --> 00:17:21.874]  I mean, I've seen national newscasts saying, look at these polar bears, they're going to die.
[00:17:22.566 --> 00:17:25.388]  They don't tell you the polar bear can swim several hundred miles in a day.
[00:17:25.868 --> 00:17:30.752]  They literally can kill whales, medium-sized whales themselves, haul them up.
[00:17:30.872 --> 00:17:34.454]  They swim from ice flow to ice flow in the ice packs.
[00:17:34.494 --> 00:17:35.615]  That's what they do.
[00:17:36.115 --> 00:17:38.837]  In fact, there's a 20-year study out just last month.
[00:17:39.077 --> 00:17:45.762]  Polar bear populations have exploded and they're now moving south because humans aren't hunting them anymore.
[00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:46.939]  That's right.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.004]  They used to be several hundred miles further south, but humans started shooting them because they're quite dangerous.
[00:17:51.364 --> 00:17:51.965]  Now they aren't.
[00:17:51.985 --> 00:17:54.347]  They're running around in limp-wristed fashion, groveling.
[00:17:54.807 --> 00:18:05.438]  And now, again, grizzlies are killing people again, mountain lions are, polar bears are, rattlesnakes are exploding in numbers, and everyone's ninnying and dying, and that's just how it works.
[00:18:05.478 --> 00:18:06.239]  So enjoy yourselves.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.863]  But the point is, this is a fraud.
[00:18:11.258 --> 00:18:14.085]  Man-made global warming is a lie, is a fraud.
[00:18:14.325 --> 00:18:15.388]  Now, don't get me wrong.
[00:18:15.448 --> 00:18:20.059]  It's either you don't care about the environment or you think the sky is falling and only world government can save us.
[00:18:21.164 --> 00:18:31.787]  No, there are real environmental crises, hundreds of them, but none of those are addressed because the only thing the big corporations are pushing for is feel-good programs like a global tax.
[00:18:32.067 --> 00:18:38.609]  You see, all the environmentalists aren't out dealing with genetic engineering, toxic waste dumping, really serious issues.
[00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:43.831]  No, instead the general public is running around pulling their hair out, freaking out,
[00:18:44.458 --> 00:19:04.879]  uh... giving money to groups that are quote gonna fight global warming and now they're trying to pass laws to ban what cows can be fed because their flatulence their methane gas yes ladies and gentlemen uh... flatulence for those are public school educated their farts and i'm sorry to have to talk like that in a second grade level but that's what flatulence is the methane gas
[00:19:05.626 --> 00:19:07.968]  And we must have a global tax now on beef.
[00:19:08.469 --> 00:19:10.670]  Of course, you can do major studies.
[00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:21.360]  You can look at the major studies showing that there were actually more bovine running around on free range just 150 years ago globally than there are in domestication today.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.841]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:19:22.921 --> 00:19:32.329]  It's all about taxing, regulating, controlling, and Big Ag was behind it all to consolidate and knock out the small farms and ranches, just like they're behind the Real ID Act
[00:19:33.379 --> 00:19:38.865]  The Animal ID Act, the Premises ID Act, it's all about controlling humans and animals as cattle to be tracked.
[00:19:40.026 --> 00:19:49.757]  So setting the table with that, I remember a decade plus ago interviewing experts on weather control and being called a kook.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:20:19.048]  but then about what five years ago there was a weather channel special called atmospheres weather control where they show the classified documents where they in Vietnam during the dry season could make it rain ten feet and kill a bunch of people and then suddenly it was declassified three years ago completely and I was able to then learn who the head of the program was that was Ben Livingston a meteorologist this guy in the fifties flew into typhoons that were 260 miles an hour
[00:20:20.487 --> 00:20:23.728]  He flew into hurricanes that were 175 miles an hour off our coast.
[00:20:24.528 --> 00:20:29.610]  And he attacked the Vietnamese leading squadrons himself while they were under sham missile attack.
[00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:33.531]  Either they can create hurricanes, they can stop hurricanes, they can knock out typhoons.
[00:20:33.571 --> 00:20:35.471]  That's just a Pacific hurricane.
[00:20:35.491 --> 00:20:38.772]  It's generally about 30-40% faster, more destructive.
[00:20:39.172 --> 00:20:41.453]  Those can get up to a recorded 280 miles an hour.
[00:20:41.993 --> 00:20:45.614]  Hurricanes only 175 is about as high as they've ever gotten.
[00:20:46.992 --> 00:20:48.473]  But, again, I'm digressing here.
[00:20:48.573 --> 00:20:49.653]  Very brave individual.
[00:20:50.114 --> 00:20:52.475]  And he's credited as the father of weather weapons.
[00:20:52.535 --> 00:20:53.155]  Still alive.
[00:20:53.175 --> 00:20:53.995]  Lives out in Midland.
[00:20:54.676 --> 00:20:56.056]  And so I flew him here.
[00:20:56.276 --> 00:20:56.476]  You know?
[00:20:57.077 --> 00:20:58.918]  Put him on an airplane, flew him here, and interviewed him.
[00:20:58.938 --> 00:21:00.738]  That's up on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:04.440]  Ben Livingston for members that are members of PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.341]  It's 15 cents a day.
[00:21:05.381 --> 00:21:06.161]  Why not go join?
[00:21:06.481 --> 00:21:07.442]  All 15 of my films.
[00:21:07.502 --> 00:21:08.542]  Hundreds of special reports.
[00:21:08.962 --> 00:21:10.103]  Hundreds of my weekly TV shows.
[00:21:10.223 --> 00:21:11.183]  The point is, it's a good place.
[00:21:11.543 --> 00:21:12.144]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:36.447]  And I interviewed him, he brought out all these documents, all these declassified documents, and oopsie, I might have seen some things that were still classified, but to make a long story short, then it got picked up by a bunch of newspapers, a bunch of national radio shows interviewed him, and in the mid-1960s, the Stanford Research Institute and the Naval Weapons Laboratory certified that he could knock out hurricanes with seven aircraft.
[00:21:36.987 --> 00:21:39.388]  That's because they have power cells that generate
[00:21:41.198 --> 00:21:47.881]  And they can fly in with the ions and disperse them, the nuclei, with the aircraft and knock them out.
[00:21:47.961 --> 00:21:49.702]  And they can build them and they can knock them out.
[00:21:50.422 --> 00:21:52.503]  Now that's 1960s technology.
[00:21:53.244 --> 00:22:00.107]  I have interviewed General Benton K. Parton, not just the former head of Air Force Weapons Development, he also headed up the Over Horizon Radar System, known as HARP.
[00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:02.228]  I've interviewed other experts on the subject.
[00:22:02.668 --> 00:22:06.310]  And there are weather control systems with antennae
[00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:13.153]  And that's why the Russians, you can hire their company for 1.2 million to clear any sky and guarantee any event will be clear.
[00:22:13.533 --> 00:22:17.536]  The Chinese have an even bigger system using antennas, which they clear things.
[00:22:17.556 --> 00:22:18.876]  In fact, that's Associated Press.
[00:22:19.236 --> 00:22:22.318]  China to force rain ahead of Olympics, the reverse, a few years ago.
[00:22:22.358 --> 00:22:25.359]  But the point is, they talk about spraying.
[00:22:25.419 --> 00:22:26.320]  It's already going on.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:31.022]  Remember up until 96, the condensation trails behind jets disappeared in minutes.
[00:22:31.062 --> 00:22:32.183]  Now they're up there for five hours.
[00:22:33.266 --> 00:22:35.889]  We're already under a weather modification program.
[00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:37.531]  It's being added to the jet fuel.
[00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:39.594]  They're even putting it in federal textbooks now.
[00:22:39.914 --> 00:22:42.197]  If you tell the public about it, they say it doesn't exist.
[00:22:42.397 --> 00:22:43.398]  But then it's in textbooks.
[00:22:43.598 --> 00:22:47.362]  It's like world governments in textbooks, but then the general public doesn't know.
[00:22:47.383 --> 00:22:49.265]  If you tell them, they say it doesn't exist.
[00:22:49.845 --> 00:22:52.468]  We'll come back, take your calls, get into the war news.
[00:22:52.488 --> 00:22:52.869]  Stay with us.
[00:23:02.739 --> 00:23:06.721]  Hi, I'm Joyce Riley and many of you know that for years I was a cardiovascular heart transplant nurse.
[00:23:07.081 --> 00:23:10.043]  Since that time, I've educated myself on the importance of preventative care.
[00:23:10.443 --> 00:23:14.305]  It all begins with providing your heart and vascular system with building blocks for good health.
[00:23:14.745 --> 00:23:18.767]  Strauss Heart Drops is the original formula that was copied by others but never duplicated.
[00:23:19.407 --> 00:23:23.911]  Strauss Heart Drops were developed by a master herbalist, Jim Strauss, after he suffered a heart attack in 1979.
[00:23:24.992 --> 00:23:27.774]  His doctor said he would only survive if he had heart bypass surgery.
[00:23:28.135 --> 00:23:28.955]  Then Jim said no.
[00:23:29.436 --> 00:23:33.719]  He developed Strauss Heart Drops, the formula that has been copied by others, but never been surpassed.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.662]  Get the original Strauss Heart Drops, 4-ounce bottle, for only $79.99.

[00:25:01.149 --> 00:25:02.870]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.792]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been murderized.
[00:25:07.113 --> 00:25:09.334]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:25:09.834 --> 00:25:16.058]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:25:16.198 --> 00:25:21.121]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:25:21.301 --> 00:25:30.266]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:26:02.699 --> 00:26:06.843]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:26:07.063 --> 00:26:08.825]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:26:09.085 --> 00:26:15.371]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:26:15.671 --> 00:26:21.797]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:26:22.037 --> 00:26:23.899]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[00:26:24.159 --> 00:26:24.580]  I think so.
[00:26:46.982 --> 00:26:49.164]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[00:26:49.204 --> 00:26:50.065]  Well, search no more.
[00:26:50.125 --> 00:26:51.346]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:16.597 --> 00:27:18.578]  Alright, welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:18.718 --> 00:27:20.579]  We're going to go to your calls here just momentarily.
[00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:22.460]  Finishing up with a weather control.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:27.823]  Weather control and modification was patented back in the 30's.
[00:27:29.304 --> 00:27:38.949]  It is a multi-billion dollar industry, that's the above board industry, with just dozens and dozens, I haven't counted them all up, big companies.
[00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:43.952]  Some of them with fleets of more than 50 airplanes that the big ski slopes and
[00:27:45.188 --> 00:27:48.629]  Farmers and different people in agriculture all hire.
[00:27:49.369 --> 00:27:55.650]  Take the ski slubs up in Canada or Colorado, they're not having enough rain, they'll call them in to seed the clouds and it works like a charm.
[00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:57.210]  That's old technologies.
[00:27:58.291 --> 00:28:14.454]  And last year, really two years ago after we broke a lot of this with Ben Livingston, the father of weather weapons, and again you can build hurricanes, build storms, or knock them out, then Kay Bailey Hutchinson did move to set up a weather control board in the U.S.
[00:28:14.554 --> 00:28:14.894]  Senate.
[00:28:15.914 --> 00:28:19.696]  And that legislation just basically languished and went nowhere.
[00:28:19.796 --> 00:28:21.897]  But this is not science fiction.
[00:28:22.037 --> 00:28:22.297]  It is 2007.
[00:28:22.857 --> 00:28:34.843]  And the patented, admitted stuff, patented in the thirties, federal government certified that it worked in the mid-sixties, Stanford Research Institute as well.
[00:28:36.354 --> 00:28:44.158]  When Katrina or Rita are coming in, they can no problem go out and knock it down, knock it down easily with 60s technology.
[00:28:45.078 --> 00:28:49.140]  And again, these are the documents, the studies into a tropical depression.
[00:28:50.401 --> 00:28:52.261]  Just into a big rainstorm.
[00:28:53.402 --> 00:28:59.285]  Whereas you might get a little bit of flooding, but you're certainly not going to have 175 mile an hour winds and things of that nature.
[00:28:59.305 --> 00:29:02.306]  And you'll be able to turn it and control it and manipulate it.
[00:29:03.427 --> 00:29:08.171]  But the government never wanted the public to know this because I'm here to tell you they already are using it.
[00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:12.334]  I remember it was in the San Antonio Express News and one other South Texas paper.
[00:29:13.295 --> 00:29:19.060]  About eight years ago they had those really bad floods and a bunch of people died in South Texas and it was a little blurb.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:29.048]  Oh, the Navy was doing weather modification tests in some thunderstorms and some local meteorologists believe they may have triggered this.
[00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:31.970]  See, they like to keep it on the low down.
[00:29:32.563 --> 00:29:36.186]  There's a lot of evidence showing that these hurricanes are being steered.
[00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:38.207]  These hurricanes are being controlled.
[00:29:39.288 --> 00:29:53.419]  And now the Chinese are using successfully to water their crops and to also clear the air for different air shows and other events or to cause rain ahead of events.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.722]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:29:56.862 --> 00:29:59.024]  China to force rain ahead of Olympics.
[00:30:00.228 --> 00:30:07.052]  Chances of showers during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, 50 percent, but Chinese meteorologists have a plan to bring sunshine.
[00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:14.316]  The meteorologists say they can force rain in the days before the Olympics through a process known as cloud seeding to clean the air and ensure clear skies.
[00:30:14.716 --> 00:30:20.659]  China has been tinkering with artificial rain making for decades, but whether it works is a matter of debate among scientists.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.321]  You mean scientists that aren't in weather modification.
[00:30:24.501 --> 00:30:26.583]  This is certified, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:27.003 --> 00:30:29.144]  During the dry season in Vietnam, it doesn't rain any.
[00:30:30.897 --> 00:30:47.764]  And Ben Livingston would go in, in the late 60's, leading small squadrons of aircraft, and find, in fact he took photos of this, I've seen now, we shot video of it, classified photos taken out of jets, of a tiny little cloud.
[00:30:48.244 --> 00:30:53.646]  And then Livingston goes in and starts spraying it, and over the next hour builds it into a giant thunderstorm.
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.121]  And then combines that with other clouds he made.
[00:30:57.161 --> 00:31:00.762]  I mean, literally, it would rain 10 feet on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[00:31:02.102 --> 00:31:03.762]  If they can do that, they can knock him out.
[00:31:03.782 --> 00:31:04.523]  And he proved that.
[00:31:04.923 --> 00:31:06.123]  I've already said enough about it.
[00:31:06.703 --> 00:31:09.704]  But, oh, to save us from global warming, they've got to do it.
[00:31:12.064 --> 00:31:14.085]  On the subject of global warming, I've got other news.
[00:31:14.145 --> 00:31:17.926]  Financial Times here reporting industry caught in carbon smoke screen.
[00:31:18.466 --> 00:31:21.947]  And then, of course, it turns out the oil companies are really behind the whole global warming hoax.
[00:31:22.583 --> 00:31:26.126]  You tell some bleeding-heart, sandal-wearing, hippie, dreadlock liberal that.
[00:31:26.506 --> 00:31:28.547]  Nothing against your sandals and dreadlocks.
[00:31:28.787 --> 00:31:30.789]  You think that's your identity, so you know it all.
[00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:33.431]  No one else cares about the earth but you.
[00:31:33.451 --> 00:31:34.752]  You have to outwardly show it.
[00:31:35.892 --> 00:31:46.360]  You tell them that they're being funded by big banks and by big oil to actually create a global tax on the people, which is then paid by governments directly into corporate welfare.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.202]  See, the phony conservatives don't understand this.
[00:31:50.516 --> 00:31:54.577]  You think that governments bad and corporations are good?
[00:31:54.917 --> 00:31:57.458]  No, corporations are the government and they're bad.
[00:31:57.758 --> 00:32:02.740]  I mean the really big ones, not the corner store that's a corporation or your corporation.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:10.682]  But yes, it's a giant private tax, by the way, that you'll be paying directly into the private IMF and World Bank.
[00:32:10.742 --> 00:32:12.263]  I did a big story up on that.
[00:32:12.763 --> 00:32:14.904]  There's another story we did for PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:32:14.944 --> 00:32:18.585]  Sick and tired of being lectured by global warming hypocrites,
[00:32:20.197 --> 00:32:23.319]  And John Travolta and Sheryl Crow and all of them.
[00:32:23.339 --> 00:32:29.984]  You know, John Travolta's got like, what, 11 jets and uses thousands of times what the average person does in CO2.
[00:32:30.224 --> 00:32:31.384]  But again, it's not a problem.
[00:32:32.025 --> 00:32:35.147]  CO2 is not a pollutant.
[00:32:35.675 --> 00:32:49.086]  It's what plants breathe, and when they breathe more CO2, they put out more oxygen, and all the major studies show all mammals, and all animal life for that matter, likes higher oxygen, and plants grow faster and more healthy with more carbon dioxide.
[00:32:49.506 --> 00:32:50.507]  Symbiotic!
[00:32:50.767 --> 00:32:56.872]  There's life on the planet because of these two gases combined with water and solar radiation, i.e.
[00:32:56.952 --> 00:32:57.192]  heat.
[00:32:58.325 --> 00:33:06.407]  But again, they know the general public can't find Iraq on a map, doesn't know how many continents there are, doesn't know who the Vice President is, doesn't know the difference between Shiite and Sunni.
[00:33:07.287 --> 00:33:09.228]  And so you tell them, the sky's falling, folks.
[00:33:09.308 --> 00:33:12.008]  They will ask how high to jump when you tell them.
[00:33:13.849 --> 00:33:16.009]  Oh my God, I just want to get through all this news.
[00:33:16.049 --> 00:33:16.469]  But you know what?
[00:33:16.489 --> 00:33:19.190]  I promised to go to your call, so we are now going to do it.
[00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:25.192]  Let's go ahead and take a call from John in Maine.
[00:33:25.352 --> 00:33:26.352]  John, you're on the air.
[00:33:26.432 --> 00:33:26.772]  Welcome.
[00:33:28.297 --> 00:33:28.899]  Hello, Alex?
[00:33:29.019 --> 00:33:30.302]  Yes, sir.
[00:33:30.362 --> 00:33:35.955]  Yeah, I just had a question as to the encounter with the We Are Change group.
[00:33:36.436 --> 00:33:37.419]  That was two weeks ago?
[00:33:38.132 --> 00:33:42.255]  Yes, but I just broke the news, and by broke the news, we just saw it.
[00:33:42.696 --> 00:33:44.597]  Friday wrote a story about it, now it's big news.
[00:33:45.318 --> 00:33:49.922]  New York police report bomb to frame activists as terrorists.
[00:33:50.302 --> 00:33:54.946]  By the time the government finds out, you'll be in the whole 30 days, the detective told them.
[00:33:55.346 --> 00:33:57.088]  It's absolutely incredible footage.
[00:33:57.108 --> 00:33:57.588]  Have you seen it?
[00:33:57.608 --> 00:33:58.969]  We're going to be airing the audio next hour.
[00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:00.330]  Yes, I have.
[00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:04.754]  I saw it on the Prison Planet link, the YouTube that was on Prison Planet.
[00:34:05.692 --> 00:34:09.054]  I, I, so those were actually New York detectives?
[00:34:09.775 --> 00:34:10.535]  Yes, they were.
[00:34:10.555 --> 00:34:15.658]  Reportedly, what they said is that they were Port Authority detectives.
[00:34:16.859 --> 00:34:23.023]  Oh, okay, because I was just wondering because, um... That's another division, and there's two different branches of the New York Police.
[00:34:24.384 --> 00:34:29.047]  Okay, because I was under the impression that their identity wasn't certain.
[00:34:29.107 --> 00:34:30.648]  I noticed, like, between
[00:34:32.543 --> 00:34:36.044]  Two minutes and fourteen seconds through two minutes and sixteen seconds.
[00:34:37.365 --> 00:34:43.566]  The guy, the one that had actually called in the false bomb threat, raised his hand in front of the video camera and there was a ring.
[00:34:43.806 --> 00:34:49.308]  So I didn't know if that might be any indication or clue as to what group he was with, but just an observation.
[00:34:49.328 --> 00:34:56.029]  Well for those that just joined us, why don't you in a minute recap and explain from your point of view what this video shows.
[00:34:59.201 --> 00:35:11.675]  What it shows is that, you know, there were these two bullies that, you know, approached the We Are Change guys who were just peacefully protesting.
[00:35:11.695 --> 00:35:17.622]  9-11 traitors who are just standing there with a sign saying 9-11 is an inside job on the public sidewalk.
[00:35:18.126 --> 00:35:23.133]  Yeah, and then they started intimidating him, and as, um... I think you got a bomb!
[00:35:23.334 --> 00:35:25.016]  Look, he's got a bomb there!
[00:35:25.497 --> 00:35:27.099]  Oh, you're going to jail!
[00:35:27.339 --> 00:35:30.203]  Doesn't matter that you're not a terrorist, we're gonna put you in the jail!
[00:35:31.753 --> 00:35:32.313]  Oh, yeah.
[00:35:32.353 --> 00:35:33.693]  I mean, that was unbelievable.
[00:35:33.713 --> 00:35:38.454]  Yeah, he did even make that Looney Tunes noise at the end, like Elmer Fudd or whoever that is.
[00:35:38.554 --> 00:35:41.215]  I mean, it was just so ignorant.
[00:35:41.295 --> 00:35:42.915]  Oh, these guys, let me tell you, they don't know.
[00:35:42.935 --> 00:35:46.696]  They literally could be paying millions a year playing top gangsters in Hollywood.
[00:35:46.716 --> 00:35:48.436]  I mean, these guys are right out of Central Casting.
[00:35:49.457 --> 00:35:49.737]  Yeah.
[00:35:49.817 --> 00:35:54.578]  They make the lead of Sopranos look like a farmer from Ohio.
[00:35:55.078 --> 00:35:55.958]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:35:56.906 --> 00:35:57.486]  Absolutely.
[00:35:57.566 --> 00:36:03.827]  I mean, folks, cops, on tape, going, hey, so look, he's got a bomb, everybody!
[00:36:03.847 --> 00:36:06.488]  Oh, what are we going to do about it?
[00:36:06.988 --> 00:36:13.549]  Larry Silverstein don't like you being here with that sign, so we're going to put you in jail for being a terrorist.
[00:36:14.469 --> 00:36:16.490]  And they're doing this on videotape.
[00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:24.311]  I mean, I guess frame-ups now will just be done, and maybe cops will start pulling wads of cocaine out and putting it right in your jacket in front of everyone.
[00:36:25.077 --> 00:36:27.079]  That's just how it is, you know.
[00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:31.802]  Anything else you'd like to add there, John and Maine?
[00:36:31.822 --> 00:36:32.783]  Say what?
[00:36:32.903 --> 00:36:34.625]  I'm gonna put you on hold.
[00:36:34.945 --> 00:36:35.565]  Hold on a minute.
[00:36:39.525 --> 00:36:45.629]  I'm gonna put you on hold, and when we get back, we'll see if you'd like to go to a FEMA count.
[00:36:45.929 --> 00:36:50.672]  Instead of calling it Police Precinct 125, we'll start calling it the Family.
[00:36:51.072 --> 00:36:53.053]  You know, the Family 127.
[00:36:53.093 --> 00:36:55.595]  We'll be right back.
[00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:02.512]  How are you feeling today?
[00:37:02.732 --> 00:37:03.212]  Why ask?

[00:38:05.743 --> 00:38:07.847]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:38:08.067 --> 00:38:09.851]  Sure, you've got a mortgage and credit cards.
[00:38:10.151 --> 00:38:13.297]  Your debt creation is probably the smartest thing you've ever done.
[00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:15.381]  How would it be to find $75,000, $150,000, $200,000 or more you never knew you had?
[00:38:18.735 --> 00:38:23.158]  Now the task force has strategies to make these debts into virtual savings accounts.
[00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:26.020]  Ben Franklin said, a penny saved is a penny earned.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:35.126]  By doing nothing more than you're doing right now, because you've used your credit, the right strategies can make the debt part of your financial life the smartest thing you've ever done.

[00:39:16.205 --> 00:39:26.732]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity
[00:39:26.772 --> 00:39:27.212]  I think so.
[00:39:54.776 --> 00:39:56.337]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:39:56.598 --> 00:40:00.060]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:05.805]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[00:40:06.145 --> 00:40:08.007]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:40:08.207 --> 00:40:11.249]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:40:11.449 --> 00:40:14.592]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:40:14.892 --> 00:40:16.753]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:20.717]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:40:20.997 --> 00:40:23.639]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:40:23.979 --> 00:40:28.525]  Second Peter says, we have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:40:28.765 --> 00:40:33.050]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:40:33.451 --> 00:40:37.796]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, packet B, the unholy alliance.
[00:40:38.096 --> 00:40:40.119]  These materials document the global leaders.
[00:40:40.319 --> 00:40:41.819]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:40:41.859 --> 00:40:42.680]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:41:14.963 --> 00:41:17.466]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:21.311]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:41:23.354 --> 00:41:30.804]  Yes, coming up in the next hour, I'm going to illustrate how much trouble the First Amendment in this country is in.
[00:41:33.075 --> 00:41:40.704]  With some past cases and some things that have happened in the last few days, but we have the audio from the video that's up on PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com.
[00:41:41.144 --> 00:41:45.029]  New York police report bomb to frame activists as terrorists.
[00:41:45.049 --> 00:41:47.872]  They just walk up and say, turn your cameras off, stop protesting.
[00:41:47.892 --> 00:41:49.134]  They say no, we're allowed to.
[00:41:49.824 --> 00:41:51.625]  And so they go, I'm going to say you have a bomb.
[00:41:51.885 --> 00:41:52.806]  And the guy goes, but I don't.
[00:41:52.846 --> 00:41:54.667]  He goes, doesn't matter that you don't have one.
[00:41:54.747 --> 00:41:57.029]  I'm going to say you have one and you're going to go to jail.
[00:41:57.129 --> 00:42:00.111]  I mean, he's the cop and he's a plainclothes.
[00:42:00.171 --> 00:42:03.893]  And later the uniformed cops show up and they're commanding them.
[00:42:04.634 --> 00:42:07.156]  And he just, I mean, it's just openly framing people.
[00:42:07.216 --> 00:42:11.999]  I mean, now it'll just be, I guess, open framing in America.
[00:42:13.052 --> 00:42:13.934]  So that's coming up.
[00:42:14.636 --> 00:42:15.698]  And it dovetails with this.
[00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:19.788]  Box of condoms leads to evacuation, Associated Press, Sunday.
[00:42:20.249 --> 00:42:20.750]  And it says...
[00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:30.796]  Ankeny, Iowa says several classrooms at Des Moines Area Community College were evacuated after college officials became nervous about a suspicious package that had been delivered.
[00:42:31.216 --> 00:42:39.022]  The evil UPS package, it turned out, ladies and gentlemen, was filled with 500 condoms for the, I guess, the health department there at the college.
[00:42:39.483 --> 00:42:41.924]  But that just shows the ninnying fear everywhere.
[00:42:41.944 --> 00:42:48.990]  And by the way, federal law, 10 years, $100,000 fine for reporting a false bomb, knowingly.
[00:42:49.648 --> 00:42:52.770]  Or false terrorist event, or the threat of a terrorist event.
[00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:55.172]  We have links to the federal law and New York's even more.
[00:42:55.472 --> 00:42:58.074]  But it doesn't matter, see, because they're the good guys.
[00:42:58.574 --> 00:43:01.636]  Hey, you're going to be in the hole, doesn't that make you innocent?
[00:43:01.916 --> 00:43:04.218]  See, they're the good guys, so they can do whatever they want.
[00:43:04.238 --> 00:43:10.222]  Because the good guys torture people on 24, and on NYPD Blue, and LA Law, and all those shows.
[00:43:10.242 --> 00:43:11.643]  You're being conditioned, America.
[00:43:11.883 --> 00:43:15.245]  And the cops go home and watch that and think it's normal to do that.
[00:43:15.265 --> 00:43:17.967]  And then they go out and do that, and they end up going to prison.
[00:43:18.207 --> 00:43:19.328]  Because that's illegal!
[00:43:21.138 --> 00:43:26.702]  I mean, we have up-close video with the guy's face as he's sitting there doing this.
[00:43:27.022 --> 00:43:32.206]  Finish up quickly, because I've got a lot of callers I want to get to here, John and Maine, but go ahead and finish up what you were saying.
[00:43:32.226 --> 00:43:48.277]  Yeah, I was just saying it was absolutely unbelievable, and the guys from We Are Change, or You Are Change, they were being so respectful, and then the thugs were, you know, accusing the guy.
[00:43:48.357 --> 00:43:50.499]  Don't talk bad about the family!
[00:43:51.112 --> 00:43:55.394]  Yeah, we run things and take care of everybody here in the neighborhood.
[00:43:55.994 --> 00:43:56.434]  Alright?
[00:43:56.995 --> 00:43:57.515]  Alright?
[00:43:58.255 --> 00:43:59.936]  Okay, good to hear from you.
[00:44:00.236 --> 00:44:01.957]  You need to go to a FEMA camp.
[00:44:02.217 --> 00:44:06.219]  You need to support your president a little bit more there, alright?
[00:44:07.179 --> 00:44:09.000]  By the way, I didn't even know this until about a month ago.
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:13.822]  I was interviewing a Village Voice reporter and I found out all these mainstream articles from the 80s and 90s.
[00:44:14.082 --> 00:44:17.084]  Did you know Rudolph Giuliani's father was a mob capo?
[00:44:18.487 --> 00:44:20.048]  I mean, an admitted capo!
[00:44:20.468 --> 00:44:26.470]  And the rest of his family, his uncles and people, were top, top, top mobsters in New York.
[00:44:27.111 --> 00:44:31.613]  And I reported this on my show, and I got emails from New York going, That's how you get things done!
[00:44:31.873 --> 00:44:34.034]  What are you, against Italians?
[00:44:34.574 --> 00:44:36.495]  Uh, no, I'm against the Mafia.
[00:44:36.755 --> 00:44:41.657]  Whether it's the German mob, or the Mexican mob, or the Italian Mafia.
[00:44:42.177 --> 00:44:42.817]  Okay?
[00:44:43.438 --> 00:44:46.259]  I mean, it just absolutely makes my head spin.
[00:44:47.173 --> 00:44:52.558]  It makes, I, it just gets, I, it's... His daddy was a mob boss!
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.102]  Bush's grandfather was the top Nazi agent in the U.S.
[00:44:58.162 --> 00:44:59.223]  Mainstream news!
[00:44:59.563 --> 00:45:02.286]  I mean, the more I learn, it's just, it's all in newspapers.
[00:45:02.726 --> 00:45:04.567]  Just the general public doesn't know about it.
[00:45:05.268 --> 00:45:08.491]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Matt in Virginia.
[00:45:08.851 --> 00:45:12.454]  Let's see if he's going to disrespect his family today.
[00:45:12.814 --> 00:45:13.375]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:45:14.185 --> 00:45:18.828]  You know, that's an amazing video, and Luke's work with Brzezinski, was that his video too?
[00:45:19.408 --> 00:45:29.174]  Yes, and I'm so honored that a few months ago he called me, he called back the other day and he said, listen, I gotta get press passes now, but I'm honored that Luke is officially with the Infowars.com team, one of our reporters.
[00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:31.655]  Yeah, he's done amazing work.
[00:45:31.675 --> 00:45:32.836]  That's just absolutely amazing.
[00:45:32.856 --> 00:45:39.681]  For those that didn't see it, tell them about this big new Brzezinski, founder of the Trilateral Commission, former National Security Advisor, founder of Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:39.721 --> 00:45:40.742]  He wrote a book bragging about it.
[00:45:41.042 --> 00:45:42.223]  Our government founded Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:42.483 --> 00:45:45.185]  Luke, a few weeks ago, confronted the founder of Al-Qaeda in New York.
[00:45:45.565 --> 00:45:47.147]  Yeah, if you haven't seen it, check it out.
[00:45:47.707 --> 00:45:48.367]  Well, that's it.
[00:45:48.408 --> 00:45:49.188]  They write it in books.
[00:45:49.208 --> 00:45:51.930]  They write it all the time, but they know Americans don't read.
[00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:54.352]  So, you know, it works in their advantage.
[00:45:54.372 --> 00:45:56.574]  And Brzezinski just said, sit down and shut up.
[00:45:56.654 --> 00:45:57.734]  Yeah, that's disgusting.
[00:45:57.774 --> 00:45:58.455]  He's disgusting.
[00:45:59.498 --> 00:46:01.259]  By the way, this is Matt Kazee from Blacksburg.
[00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:05.280]  Oh my gosh, Matt is one of my listeners.
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.460]  He's a 9-11 truther too.
[00:46:06.741 --> 00:46:07.841]  He lives on the campus.
[00:46:08.121 --> 00:46:18.445]  His buddy shot the cell phone video with the gunshots going off and he broke down how it was obviously an inside job and all the weird Marine Corps training and things on the base.
[00:46:19.385 --> 00:46:21.746]  Tell folks why as a local you have suspicions.
[00:46:22.106 --> 00:46:27.688]  Oh, and you reported that, and we also talked to him, police and emergency workers reported they were told to stand down by the feds.
[00:46:27.708 --> 00:46:28.008]  Go ahead.
[00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:35.616]  Well, you know, I have some... Here's why it really, uh, stinks, is, uh, you know, forget the murder thing for a second.
[00:46:35.636 --> 00:46:42.282]  Sure, they cancel classes when somebody shot somebody three miles away, but the week before, the bomb threats, the Monday before, they cancel classes.
[00:46:42.562 --> 00:46:44.063]  Friday the 13th, bomb threats.
[00:46:44.363 --> 00:46:45.344]  They cancel classes.
[00:46:45.664 --> 00:46:49.548]  Monday the 16th, bomb threats, and two dead in the dorm, and they don't cancel.
[00:46:50.008 --> 00:46:55.813]  Now, get this, this is the reason... First off, I wanted to thank you, Alex, for having a forum where you don't screen calls,
[00:46:56.269 --> 00:46:58.291]  It's so rare to see that in talk radio.
[00:46:58.331 --> 00:47:03.594]  I mean, I tried for three weeks to get onto the Glenn Beck program, and, you know, it's nearly impossible.
[00:47:03.614 --> 00:47:04.695]  He's part of the family.
[00:47:04.715 --> 00:47:06.176]  He knows who he's working with.
[00:47:06.316 --> 00:47:10.900]  As to why do you think he has his finger going, shhh, as his main picture, he wants people to shut up.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:17.484]  But I wanted to thank you for your kind words to me, on and off air, towards me and my family and friends.
[00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:23.629]  And, you know, people who are skeptical of Alex Jones, they don't know Alex, and they don't take the time to get to know him.
[00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:34.033]  But I wanted to bring to your attention a petition that has started to support President Steger's decision, or at least to support him and the police chief.
[00:47:35.053 --> 00:47:36.393]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:47:36.474 --> 00:47:39.074]  Columbine, they stood down for four hours and fifteen minutes.
[00:47:39.114 --> 00:47:40.055]  That was a black op.
[00:47:40.455 --> 00:47:41.695]  Hundreds of articles have been written.
[00:47:41.735 --> 00:47:43.576]  If you don't know about it, just go research it.
[00:47:44.316 --> 00:47:48.017]  Type Columbine, government op, and all the stuff will pop up for you.
[00:47:48.257 --> 00:47:49.637]  Spend the next ten years learning about it.
[00:47:49.657 --> 00:47:51.078]  There's so much evidence, it's insane.
[00:47:51.378 --> 00:47:52.118]  Like everything else.
[00:47:52.658 --> 00:47:58.381]  With this one, you had a shooting there last year with weird special forces connections out of Afghanistan.
[00:47:58.701 --> 00:48:00.962]  Then they had drills there the week before.
[00:48:01.022 --> 00:48:02.703]  Put in loudspeakers for mass shootings.
[00:48:02.763 --> 00:48:04.684]  It's an activist anti-gun school.
[00:48:05.565 --> 00:48:10.187]  Then, for almost two hours after there's been a shooting, they order everybody to be quiet.
[00:48:10.447 --> 00:48:11.868]  They don't warn anybody till...
[00:48:12.814 --> 00:48:18.856]  Almost 10 o'clock, while the shooting continues, and the feds ordered the local police to stand down as usual.
[00:48:19.176 --> 00:48:25.878]  I mean, that right there is the government not letting the people protect themselves, can't have a gun on campus, and then the cops waiting for hours.
[00:48:26.178 --> 00:48:28.399]  Back in 63, that didn't happen at UT.
[00:48:28.619 --> 00:48:31.119]  We had real police then, we had real citizens.
[00:48:31.139 --> 00:48:32.820]  I mean, can you imagine if
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:36.201]  Citizens would have started pulling up with guns and shooting back at him.
[00:48:36.461 --> 00:48:38.042]  The cops would have gunned us down in a minute.
[00:48:38.262 --> 00:48:39.522]  But not back in the 60s.
[00:48:39.582 --> 00:48:40.723]  It was, get up here and help us!
[00:48:40.943 --> 00:48:43.964]  And the citizens pinned him down so he couldn't kill more people.
[00:48:44.144 --> 00:48:47.305]  So the police, with his citizen, could get up there and kill that guy.
[00:48:47.345 --> 00:48:50.386]  I've interviewed, by the way, Ray Martinez, one of the shooters that took him out.
[00:48:50.406 --> 00:48:50.827]  Go ahead.
[00:48:51.427 --> 00:48:54.408]  Yeah, I mean, in this country they're actually trying to outlaw heroes.
[00:48:54.807 --> 00:48:56.550]  It's all vigilantes, how dare you take one?
[00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:58.794]  You've got to be trained to call a ninny.
[00:48:59.114 --> 00:49:01.278]  Your wife's being raped, you sit there like a coward.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.862]  Like, who's the beetle who just died?
[00:49:03.903 --> 00:49:04.443]  He did that.
[00:49:04.784 --> 00:49:07.208]  You're supposed to sit there and cower, and then call the cops.
[00:49:07.228 --> 00:49:08.831]  You take an average of 18 minutes to arrive.
[00:49:09.577 --> 00:49:10.218]  Well, that's it.
[00:49:10.258 --> 00:49:11.179]  You know, they've trained us.
[00:49:11.379 --> 00:49:14.922]  They have literally tried their best to train us into trusting the system.
[00:49:14.982 --> 00:49:16.504]  And they've turned the cops into cowards.
[00:49:16.564 --> 00:49:19.126]  Cops 20 years ago wouldn't have followed orders to stand down.
[00:49:19.527 --> 00:49:21.609]  You couldn't have held them back from running into that building.
[00:49:21.769 --> 00:49:22.109]  Well, that's it.
[00:49:22.149 --> 00:49:23.531]  And you know what's funny about it, Alex?
[00:49:23.651 --> 00:49:31.438]  Is that any cop, like the few in this situation, that decided against their will to follow these orders now know the difference.
[00:49:31.579 --> 00:49:34.021]  And it seems like that's the only way a cop figures it out.
[00:49:35.091 --> 00:49:36.552]  Or if they have a good friend or a partner.
[00:49:36.572 --> 00:49:36.892]  I agree.
[00:49:36.952 --> 00:49:44.035]  Matt Kazee, a Virginia Tech student, lives right there on the campus, literally a block away from where the shootings took place.
[00:49:45.235 --> 00:49:49.957]  Any other facets of why you and many others at the school believe it's some type of inside job?
[00:49:50.237 --> 00:49:54.339]  Well, you know, I did an interview with Larry Pratt the other day, and I wanted to thank you for that.
[00:49:54.719 --> 00:50:01.942]  And we were talking about things, and I said, you know, we're really not going to know until the Freedom of Information Act requests go through and we find out all the details.
[00:50:02.304 --> 00:50:03.025]  And then they sealed it.
[00:50:03.045 --> 00:50:04.087]  They just sealed all the Columbine info.
[00:50:04.107 --> 00:50:05.188]  Good to hear from you my friend.
[00:50:05.289 --> 00:50:05.549]  Anything else?
[00:50:16.485 --> 00:50:17.726]  That they're trying to save these guys.
[00:50:17.766 --> 00:50:20.687]  And you read the comments and they're all like, oh, Steger's a hero!
[00:50:21.067 --> 00:50:21.607]  And all this stuff.
[00:50:21.627 --> 00:50:22.028]  Now they've got $40,000.
[00:50:22.108 --> 00:50:23.889]  Pretty soon it'll be like Giuliani.
[00:50:23.929 --> 00:50:28.951]  I mean, even if you don't think 9-11's an inside job, the government did a horrible job letting it happen standing down.
[00:50:28.991 --> 00:50:31.392]  Instead, Giuliani's a hero!
[00:50:31.712 --> 00:50:34.814]  And now the Virginia Tech guy, he's a hero too!
[00:50:35.094 --> 00:50:37.235]  Is there any way that we can get a petition started
[00:50:37.575 --> 00:50:40.616]  To find out who made that decision and to get them fired.
[00:50:40.636 --> 00:50:43.097]  I mean, do you have any advice for me as far as looking into that?
[00:50:43.157 --> 00:50:46.438]  Look, just, you know, they've got the online petitions and the sites and the systems.
[00:50:46.458 --> 00:50:47.118]  That's what they're telling me.
[00:50:47.258 --> 00:50:48.258]  Yeah, you start it up.
[00:50:48.298 --> 00:50:49.199]  I'll have you on as a guest.
[00:50:49.239 --> 00:50:50.299]  We'll launch it and promote it.
[00:50:50.579 --> 00:50:50.819]  All right.
[00:50:50.839 --> 00:50:52.080]  Thanks again, Alex, for everything.
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:52.500]  You bet.
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.820]  Oh, now, by the time they're done, this guy will end up being the U.S.
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:51:00.082]  President for his heroic actions at Virginia Tech, ordering a stand down for over three hours.
[00:51:00.626 --> 00:51:04.248]  He will now be replacing Jesus at the head of the church.
[00:51:04.808 --> 00:51:10.571]  All worship the Dean of Virginia Tech, the school president, and the police chief.
[00:51:10.891 --> 00:51:11.892]  Brave men.
[00:51:12.272 --> 00:51:24.799]  I watched a video of these huge, and I'm not knocking fat people, I mean I got a little bit of a belly on me, but I mean these big fat waddling cops jiggling and running and hiding and for like hours playing with their gear and they got scared looks on their faces.
[00:51:25.639 --> 00:51:27.340]  I mean I'm not even saying I'm a tough guy but
[00:51:28.593 --> 00:51:30.414]  Frankly, I've taken guns away from a few people.
[00:51:30.434 --> 00:51:32.116]  I grew up rough in Dallas.
[00:51:32.136 --> 00:51:32.676]  I don't know why.
[00:51:32.696 --> 00:51:34.117]  I had a pretty good family.
[00:51:34.958 --> 00:51:36.058]  I just don't understand this.
[00:51:37.099 --> 00:51:39.821]  You couldn't keep police 20, 30 years ago from charging in there.
[00:51:40.341 --> 00:51:44.144]  But, to be a cop nowadays, I guess the ones that aren't castrated get kicked out.
[00:51:44.744 --> 00:51:46.446]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:46.646 --> 00:51:48.287]  Stay with us, second hour straight ahead.
[00:51:51.127 --> 00:51:52.348]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:51:57.371 --> 00:52:00.253]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.

[00:52:36.094 --> 00:52:39.817]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.

[00:53:21.267 --> 00:53:23.067]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:53:23.087 --> 00:53:25.008]  Alright, in the 220-something years of U.S.
[00:53:25.028 --> 00:53:35.610]  history, up until about 5-6 years ago, the country's 234 years old, so really in about the last 227 years.
[00:53:50.666 --> 00:53:51.907]  No one needed a permit.
[00:53:51.967 --> 00:53:54.588]  No one needed to get permission to protest or demonstrate.
[00:53:55.229 --> 00:53:56.550]  But then they snuck it in.
[00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:03.994]  They said, oh, if you're going to block the street, you need a permit for a march or a parade.
[00:54:04.014 --> 00:54:05.575]  Well, that's totally reasonable.
[00:54:06.515 --> 00:54:07.716]  But then they said, oh, guess what?
[00:54:07.756 --> 00:54:08.977]  You need it to be anywhere.
[00:54:09.417 --> 00:54:12.079]  So it isn't even really a law, but the police don't know that.
[00:54:12.099 --> 00:54:13.259]  They just march out and arrest you.
[00:54:13.279 --> 00:54:14.720]  Remember in 2000,
[00:54:16.849 --> 00:54:22.934]  What was it, like 14 lawsuits were lost by the state of Texas by the Capitol Police.
[00:54:24.115 --> 00:54:35.104]  If you protest anywhere around the Capitol, even off Capitol grounds, or anywhere around the Governor's mansion, the big lawsuit they lost was there was a handicapped rights group in their wheelchairs out there.
[00:54:35.124 --> 00:54:37.266]  They just said, no, you can't be on the sidewalk.
[00:54:38.149 --> 00:54:41.510]  And they arrested a bunch of them and the state lost a hundred grand apiece on that.
[00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:43.031]  Because it is still America.
[00:54:43.071 --> 00:54:56.115]  I mean, I know the government and the corporations that have bought out this country and devalued the dollar and the rest of it want us to be their slaves and want to get it in position so that when the public finds out about how we've been economically brought down by design, folks are going to riot.
[00:54:56.175 --> 00:55:02.997]  I know you've geared up for it and issued all your little riot gear and your training to all your goons, but it isn't going to work, okay?
[00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:07.797]  And all over the nation, especially New York City, it's the worst.
[00:55:07.817 --> 00:55:12.026]  They've even had like the CIA spying on bicycling rights groups.
[00:55:12.066 --> 00:55:12.948]  That's come out in the news.
[00:55:14.429 --> 00:55:21.051]  And I've been up in New York quite a bit, covering 9-11 in the last five years, and I've been there and have cops walk right up and say, we're going to arrest you.
[00:55:21.071 --> 00:55:24.252]  You're not allowed to interview anybody on the streets of New York without a permit.
[00:55:24.752 --> 00:55:30.754]  And I say, go ahead and arrest me, and I will sue you, and you can tell by the way I'm talking to you, and I'm going to sue you.
[00:55:31.174 --> 00:55:34.035]  And you may even beat that suit, but I know how to sue you personally.
[00:55:34.555 --> 00:55:35.635]  This is all on tape, by the way.
[00:55:35.675 --> 00:55:36.335]  Many people have seen it.
[00:55:36.375 --> 00:55:36.975]  I put it out there.
[00:55:37.596 --> 00:55:38.836]  I'm going to end up owning you.
[00:55:39.565 --> 00:55:41.548]  Stop trying to vi... and what's your problem?
[00:55:41.748 --> 00:55:46.454]  Why are you showing dis... You're disrespecting me in my face in America.
[00:55:46.695 --> 00:55:50.560]  When my grandfathers fought for this country and when their fathers fought for this country.
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:52.623]  This is my country scumbag!
[00:55:53.003 --> 00:55:54.145]  Now get out of my face!
[00:55:55.474 --> 00:55:58.115]  Oh, what you doing talking bad to me?
[00:55:58.355 --> 00:56:00.857]  Why does nobody appreciate us?
[00:56:01.257 --> 00:56:12.642]  I mean, that's the attitude across this nation, that we're here to serve the government, we're here to suck your boots, lick your boots, clean your house, you know, pay your salaries, and listen, I have nothing against police.
[00:56:13.142 --> 00:56:20.185]  They watch the TV shows showing they're supposed to torture people and frame people, and that's what good guys do, and they're weak-minded like everybody else, they just go along with it.
[00:56:21.278 --> 00:56:28.604]  It's the private corporations that have bought up the government, and literally expand the size of government every day just to get more corporate welfare.
[00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:30.006]  That's the problem.
[00:56:30.506 --> 00:56:34.450]  And I want police to know that I'm their friend, but I'm tired of Austin police.
[00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:40.034]  When I'm a hundred feet away videotaping a checkpoint, marching up and saying, turn the camera off, until I go, no.
[00:56:40.555 --> 00:56:41.255]  I'm going to arrest you.
[00:56:41.275 --> 00:56:41.736]  Go ahead.
[00:56:42.416 --> 00:56:42.997]  First Amendment.
[00:56:43.962 --> 00:56:46.163]  I mean, I don't like having to stand up to you.
[00:56:46.503 --> 00:56:48.503]  And I've seen people who let the bullying work.
[00:56:49.224 --> 00:56:50.684]  It's all like dog psychology.
[00:56:50.704 --> 00:56:54.365]  If you kind of cower and get on your back and show your belly, they might even squirt on you.
[00:56:54.385 --> 00:56:54.785]  You know what I mean?
[00:56:54.805 --> 00:56:55.485]  Like a dog does.
[00:56:55.505 --> 00:56:57.066]  Just kind of raise a leg and psst.
[00:56:57.126 --> 00:56:57.626]  Oh, there you go.
[00:56:57.866 --> 00:56:58.566]  There you go.
[00:56:58.586 --> 00:57:00.547]  That's where you need to be.
[00:57:00.967 --> 00:57:01.607]  Down there.
[00:57:01.667 --> 00:57:03.408]  Take it.
[00:57:03.828 --> 00:57:07.309]  Let me tell you, the public's here so my ego feels good.
[00:57:07.869 --> 00:57:11.910]  I was a bully in school, and now I'm a bully in the uniform.
[00:57:12.341 --> 00:57:14.963]  And everybody's gonna get used to it, alright?
[00:57:15.464 --> 00:57:16.745]  Alright, I gotta quit doing that voice.
[00:57:17.205 --> 00:57:18.226]  I'm just tired of it.
[00:57:18.286 --> 00:57:19.026]  Leave me alone!
[00:57:19.967 --> 00:57:20.768]  Leave me alone!
[00:57:20.908 --> 00:57:21.448]  Stop it!
[00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:37.501]  God Almighty, if the cops knew they're giving their kids Aspartame, Diet Coke, they're taking thimerosal mercury-filled shots, they're drinking the same poison, they're having their dollar debased, they're being screwed just the same way, I'm your friend.
[00:57:37.801 --> 00:57:40.143]  But I'm not gonna sit here and feed you a line of bull.
[00:57:40.223 --> 00:57:40.844]  I don't do that.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.541]  Now, I've seen a lot.
[00:57:44.081 --> 00:58:03.916]  In my film Road to Tyranny, and by the way, in the story we wrote, New York Police Report Bomb to Frame Activists as Terrorists, that Aaron Dykes and I put together, we have some past things, like Abby Newman, naval veteran, no criminal record, farm wife, going into town to get canning supplies, and she's driving back in, we're going to play this audio coming up, we're going to play the new stuff,
[00:58:04.634 --> 00:58:06.796]  And she comes to a big checkpoint in the middle of nowhere.
[00:58:06.856 --> 00:58:07.416]  State Police.
[00:58:07.756 --> 00:58:08.357]  They walk over.
[00:58:08.377 --> 00:58:09.317]  They want to search her car.
[00:58:09.357 --> 00:58:10.098]  They want her info.
[00:58:10.118 --> 00:58:11.359]  And she says, You know what?
[00:58:11.379 --> 00:58:11.959]  This is America.
[00:58:11.999 --> 00:58:13.160]  You don't have any probable cause.
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:13.540]  No.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.301]  So they jerk her out of the car.
[00:58:15.341 --> 00:58:15.982]  She doesn't resist.
[00:58:16.022 --> 00:58:17.242]  It's all in her squad car video.
[00:58:17.723 --> 00:58:20.204]  They charge her with resisting, you know, because we're not human beings.
[00:58:20.244 --> 00:58:23.186]  Like psychopaths don't know a child they kidnap is a human being.
[00:58:23.206 --> 00:58:25.448]  You have to talk to them like, Hey, that's a child.
[00:58:25.748 --> 00:58:27.609]  Her name's Becky Johnson.
[00:58:28.830 --> 00:58:29.570]  Jane Doe.
[00:58:29.911 --> 00:58:30.691]  She's real.
[00:58:30.791 --> 00:58:31.732]  She has a life.
[00:58:32.572 --> 00:58:33.532]  Don't do this.
[00:58:33.632 --> 00:58:34.293]  It's wrong.
[00:58:34.773 --> 00:58:36.333]  Well, I'm doing that to the cops now, the government.
[00:58:36.913 --> 00:58:39.194]  Listen, we're not all Al-Qaeda, okay?
[00:58:39.874 --> 00:58:42.815]  You're being controlled by corrupt corporations that have bought off the country.
[00:58:44.275 --> 00:58:54.878]  And they pull out a pocket Constitution in her trunk, they find a Patriot Games video with Harrison Ford, I guess he's a terrorist now, they find my film, Police State 2000, and they start going, Oh, let me see.
[00:58:54.898 --> 00:58:56.679]  Is this illegal?
[00:58:56.759 --> 00:58:59.219]  And one of them's going, It may be illegal.
[00:58:59.459 --> 00:59:01.780]  And the other state police officer in rock mount
[00:59:03.514 --> 00:59:07.296]  Virginia goes, no, she may be allowed to have that.
[00:59:08.216 --> 00:59:09.677]  That's a pocket constitution.
[00:59:09.957 --> 00:59:13.098]  You see them, they're in front of the squad car, and they think it's all normal.
[00:59:13.118 --> 00:59:14.059]  They're doing this on video.
[00:59:14.519 --> 00:59:16.500]  I wonder if this here is illegal.
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.441]  Ah, gee, I don't know.
[00:59:19.481 --> 00:59:23.203]  And then they go, man, she's into all this weird freedom stuff.
[00:59:23.243 --> 00:59:24.283]  You've got to hear the video.
[00:59:24.323 --> 00:59:26.464]  Well, see, right before that, I have FEMA.
[00:59:27.407 --> 00:59:36.715]  In Kansas City, in front of firefighters and police and sheriff deputies, a firefighter shot this in horror because I've been on the air in Kansas City now for nine years.
[00:59:36.795 --> 00:59:37.735]  Great affiliate up there, KCXL.
[00:59:39.392 --> 00:59:40.633]  And a great affiliate.
[00:59:40.673 --> 00:59:42.714]  But the point is, he's got a camera.
[00:59:42.734 --> 00:59:43.594]  He's videotaping it.
[00:59:43.995 --> 00:59:48.817]  And there's this special forces op guy for FEMA going, all Christians are terrorists.
[00:59:49.297 --> 00:59:50.298]  Folks, you've got to see the video.
[00:59:50.498 --> 00:59:51.999]  The founding fathers are terrorists.
[00:59:52.219 --> 00:59:53.200]  Then we show the manual.
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.061]  It says gun owners, constitutionalists.
[00:59:55.521 --> 00:59:57.322]  By the way, you think this just started under Clinton?
[00:59:57.362 --> 00:59:58.943]  It's gotten worse since Bush got in.
[00:59:59.523 --> 01:00:01.344]  Okay, I've got all this stuff on my website.
[01:00:02.325 --> 01:00:03.285]  And so all this happens.
[01:00:03.305 --> 01:00:04.886]  I mean, I've got hundreds of examples of this.
[01:00:05.684 --> 01:00:14.939]  uh... the city attorney in upstate new york is wearing a peace on earth shirt and the security guard thinks it's an anti-war shirt so they have him arrested that was a big mistake
[01:00:18.024 --> 01:00:30.855]  I'm sure you've heard the stories of 500 Bush supporters standing on a street corner in Kentucky and one guy's got a no blood for oil sign so they arrest him and he gets two years in federal prison because they said no you're not allowed to it's a free speech zone.
[01:00:30.895 --> 01:00:33.257]  We say who and how and it's all selective.
[01:00:33.577 --> 01:00:37.380]  I interviewed another guy out of Nashville, Tennessee who by the way was a Bush supporter.
[01:00:38.021 --> 01:00:39.923]  Vietnam veteran, big conservative guy.
[01:00:39.943 --> 01:00:41.044]  It was about two years ago.
[01:00:41.464 --> 01:00:42.525]  Bush was coming to town
[01:00:44.063 --> 01:00:45.645]  No, it was more than that.
[01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:46.165]  It was 2004.
[01:00:46.546 --> 01:00:47.126]  Time has just flown.
[01:00:47.186 --> 01:00:59.457]  So three years ago, during the campaign, it made big news, and the FBI came into his office and said, we're just letting everybody know, no anti-Bush signs in the windows.
[01:01:00.078 --> 01:01:01.259]  And he said, well, what do you mean?
[01:01:01.279 --> 01:01:03.141]  It was a big coffee shop right by the federal building.
[01:01:03.161 --> 01:01:05.343]  And he goes, well, number one, I'm a Bush supporter.
[01:01:06.115 --> 01:01:07.235]  Do you see my car out there?
[01:01:07.275 --> 01:01:09.756]  It's got George Bush, you know, 04 on it.
[01:01:10.097 --> 01:01:10.737]  Bush-Shaney.
[01:01:10.797 --> 01:01:12.217]  But this is America.
[01:01:12.297 --> 01:01:13.998]  I fought in Vietnam for free speech.
[01:01:14.078 --> 01:01:15.399]  I'll put whatever I want in the window.
[01:01:15.779 --> 01:01:17.580]  And they said, no you won't or you'll be arrested.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.061]  So he went from store to store and found out they told everybody.
[01:01:21.301 --> 01:01:22.541]  And this came out in the newspaper.
[01:01:23.902 --> 01:01:24.762]  And that was it.
[01:01:24.822 --> 01:01:27.203]  He put a big sign up against Bush in the window.
[01:01:29.728 --> 01:01:34.230]  I mean, this is not America, ladies and gentlemen, and it's only going to get worse once Hillary's in.
[01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:36.291]  This is their enchilada.
[01:01:36.311 --> 01:01:37.731]  They're all into free speech attacks.
[01:01:37.751 --> 01:01:40.593]  It doesn't matter who's in office, it's the New World Order agenda.
[01:01:40.953 --> 01:01:42.794]  So when we get back, I'm going to play this audio.
[01:01:43.614 --> 01:01:45.195]  Now, the video's ten times more powerful.
[01:01:45.555 --> 01:01:46.975]  Again, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:53.418]  The easiest place to find it is JonesReport.com, because it's still on the main page from Friday.
[01:01:53.518 --> 01:01:58.020]  Prison Planet, it's updated three times a day, but on Jones Report, it's right up on the main page.
[01:01:58.661 --> 01:02:02.722]  Headline, New York Police Report Bomb to Frame Activist as Terrorist.
[01:02:03.182 --> 01:02:10.065]  And why this is important is, Luke Radowsky is a reporter, he's been a reporter for at least two months, I've known him for two years.
[01:02:11.485 --> 01:02:14.346]  One of the head guys in 9-11 Truth in New York, he's 21 years old.
[01:02:15.046 --> 01:02:18.147]  Luke Radowsky, you know what, I'll tell you the story when we get back.
[01:02:18.467 --> 01:02:23.489]  We'll go to your calls, then we'll go to Ross, TJ, Phil, many others on the other side.
[01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:40.128]  And I just hope that you will go look at this, because when the police on video start saying, we're going to frame you, and I know you're innocent, but we're going to frame you if you don't leave, then you know America is in deep trouble.
[01:02:40.409 --> 01:02:43.650]  I mean, that's like, it's just unspeakable.
[01:02:43.810 --> 01:02:44.431]  We'll be right back.
[01:02:44.451 --> 01:02:44.851]  Stay with us.
[01:02:55.629 --> 01:03:01.095]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:01.456 --> 01:03:09.104]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:03:09.784 --> 01:03:16.826]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:28.650]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:32.472]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:03:32.932 --> 01:03:34.872]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:03:35.193 --> 01:03:39.034]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:03:52.788 --> 01:03:54.728]  Hi, John Heumann from Midas Resources.
[01:03:54.989 --> 01:03:57.629]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[01:03:57.929 --> 01:04:06.231]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[01:04:06.531 --> 01:04:09.352]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[01:04:10.192 --> 01:04:13.412]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[01:04:14.733 --> 01:04:16.313]  How much are you willing to lose?
[01:04:16.713 --> 01:04:17.634]  Take action now!
[01:04:17.774 --> 01:04:21.915]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[01:04:22.596 --> 01:04:26.357]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[01:04:26.558 --> 01:04:29.779]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[01:04:29.899 --> 01:04:36.322]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[01:04:36.622 --> 01:04:38.665]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[01:04:38.705 --> 01:04:39.787]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[01:04:39.807 --> 01:04:41.609]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[01:04:52.461 --> 01:04:52.681]  Some.
[01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:56.225]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:59.368]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[01:04:59.869 --> 01:05:02.071]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[01:05:02.692 --> 01:05:11.000]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[01:05:11.481 --> 01:05:12.041]  An example?
[01:05:12.562 --> 01:05:15.365]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[01:05:16.264 --> 01:05:19.026]  If you intend to starve or finish your supply, call immediately.
[01:05:19.406 --> 01:05:22.728]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[01:05:23.448 --> 01:05:28.651]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[01:05:29.271 --> 01:05:30.772]  Money is not the problem.
[01:05:30.972 --> 01:05:31.973]  Availability is.
[01:05:32.493 --> 01:05:32.953]  Be careful.
[01:05:32.993 --> 01:05:38.236]  When food supplies get short, with no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[01:05:38.886 --> 01:05:42.108]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com 800-409-5633
[01:05:52.378 --> 01:06:00.900]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.921]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[01:06:03.121 --> 01:06:04.321]  That's one in four adults.
[01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:10.743]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[01:06:11.023 --> 01:06:14.664]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[01:06:57.916 --> 01:06:58.876]  We've got you covered.
[01:06:58.896 --> 01:07:00.537]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.225 --> 01:07:15.499]  Broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide, this is the Alex Jones Show!
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.263]  Alright, I'm acting stupid for the studio audience.
[01:07:19.084 --> 01:07:19.905]  Let me get serious.
[01:07:22.532 --> 01:07:37.182]  No, when you go to third world countries like Roatan and Honduras and you watch the people bowing to police and everyone looking with fear and kind of scurrying up against the wall and they see cops and the cops look like something right out of a horror movie, you know you're in third world cess.
[01:07:39.024 --> 01:07:43.007]  And it's just sad to see my beloved America turn into a third world country in every way.
[01:07:43.047 --> 01:07:45.528]  Our currency being debased like a third world nation.
[01:07:45.548 --> 01:07:47.269]  The public doesn't even know what that means on average.
[01:07:47.770 --> 01:07:49.251]  The police more and more corrupt.
[01:07:50.249 --> 01:07:57.135]  The government bloated and bankrupt, but then it has the added propaganda of a high-tech police state.
[01:07:58.316 --> 01:08:10.066]  But imagine, Luke Rodowski and a couple other guys from 9-11 Truth, the local 9-11 Truth squad out there, and there they are, WeAreChange.org, great folks.
[01:08:12.529 --> 01:08:16.993]  They're simply out there with a sign saying 9-11 is an inside job, as they've done hundreds of times.
[01:08:17.333 --> 01:08:24.238]  And we've had the Hercules team, the guys with the machine guns, the black uniforms, walk up and aim machine guns at them and say, need to get out of here!
[01:08:24.258 --> 01:08:25.859]  I mean, it just gets worse and worse.
[01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:27.361]  They just love to intimidate.
[01:08:27.561 --> 01:08:28.601]  You think it's your right!
[01:08:29.042 --> 01:08:39.450]  And see, the criminality's gotten so bad with government now, that they are right out in the open, right out in the open,
[01:08:40.434 --> 01:08:44.939]  Now, if you listen, first they say, that could be a bomb, you could be a terrorist, and by the end of it, they go, look!
[01:08:45.199 --> 01:08:46.361]  He's got a bomb!
[01:08:46.381 --> 01:08:47.702]  And this is a... you ought to go watch the video.
[01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:56.011]  Crowded street, crowded people, New York detectives yelling, he's got a bomb, and then saying, you just threatened me!
[01:08:56.451 --> 01:08:59.755]  And then the plainclothes cops show up and start following orders from them.
[01:09:01.605 --> 01:09:10.289]  I mean, can you imagine what would have happened if they would have turned the cameras off and they told him he was under arrest, they put him in handcuffs, then they grabbed his cell phone and held it up and went, look, a gun!
[01:09:10.549 --> 01:09:13.570]  But then by then on the video, it's their friends down the street videotaping.
[01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:14.531]  Luke's smart.
[01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:19.913]  He knows now that harassment's gotten so bad, he'll have a few cameras spaced out down the street to catch this on tape.
[01:09:20.273 --> 01:09:23.254]  You can watch like 20 minutes of it up on JonesReport.com right now.
[01:09:23.494 --> 01:09:24.715]  We're just going to play five of it.
[01:09:25.095 --> 01:09:26.496]  Listen carefully.
[01:09:27.016 --> 01:09:29.237]  Okay, now, I mean, these guys look like
[01:09:30.091 --> 01:09:31.392]  Something right out of the Sopranos.
[01:09:32.092 --> 01:09:33.033]  And I've been there.
[01:09:33.153 --> 01:09:34.133]  Similar stuff's happened to me.
[01:09:34.173 --> 01:09:35.454]  They haven't said, though, you've got a bomb.
[01:09:35.774 --> 01:09:37.855]  They've just said, OK, I'm going to arrest you.
[01:09:38.516 --> 01:09:39.876]  But you go, but I've got a First Amendment.
[01:09:40.116 --> 01:09:43.058]  That don't matter to me.
[01:09:43.718 --> 01:09:47.440]  And they start joking, going, somebody's going to jail.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.541]  And it all starts when somebody walks up smoking a pipe.
[01:09:49.561 --> 01:09:50.302]  Looks like CIA.
[01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:55.710]  And he goes, he starts arguing with him about how Building 7 burned for three days, which it didn't burn for a few hours.
[01:09:56.210 --> 01:09:58.890]  And then he says, you're not allowed to have that, you're not allowed to be demonstrating.
[01:09:58.910 --> 01:10:01.411]  I mean, we're not demonstrators, we're engaging in the First Amendment.
[01:10:02.011 --> 01:10:13.353]  And then the plainclothes come, then the police come, and then Luke said some other cops showed up and got mad, and we're griping out the detectives, like, hey, you can't claim people have bombs that don't.
[01:10:13.893 --> 01:10:19.034]  And in the article we've written, we have links to the federal and state law about reporting fake bomb threats.
[01:10:19.694 --> 01:10:19.934]  Okay?
[01:10:20.882 --> 01:10:22.803]  Meanwhile, I have the Associated Press today.
[01:10:23.123 --> 01:10:27.885]  Four students arrested for heckling FBI Director as he came into Harvard University.
[01:10:28.345 --> 01:10:30.166]  In the past, they would just remove them.
[01:10:30.206 --> 01:10:32.027]  See, now they've been arrested and charged.
[01:10:32.427 --> 01:10:37.989]  See, everything is about destroying freedom because the government's got some very bad things they're going to do to you very soon.
[01:10:38.309 --> 01:10:40.070]  They made the decision to dump the dollar.
[01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:41.491]  I know you don't know what that means.
[01:10:41.511 --> 01:10:42.451]  You'll find out soon enough.
[01:10:42.991 --> 01:10:44.152]  I'm not trying to be condescending.
[01:10:44.192 --> 01:10:47.153]  I just know the general audience has been totally brain-dead and brainwashed.
[01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:50.855]  Alright, here is New York City and Pure Mafia, USA.
[01:10:50.875 --> 01:10:53.837]  Now let's go ahead and roll that tape.
[01:10:54.578 --> 01:10:56.159]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:56.179 --> 01:10:58.280]  9-11 Truth, out on the streets of New York.
[01:10:58.961 --> 01:11:01.722]  And to stop their free speech, they sent for Larry Silverstein.
[01:11:01.983 --> 01:11:03.103]  Larry doesn't like it!
[01:11:03.123 --> 01:11:07.906]  The owner of Building 7 and the whole complex, who said that he blew up Building 7, on tape.
[01:11:08.467 --> 01:11:11.309]  Larry doesn't like them protesting on the public sidewalk doing this.
[01:11:11.329 --> 01:11:11.629]  Here it is.
[01:11:15.555 --> 01:11:16.536]  Why would you be calling the cops?
[01:11:16.556 --> 01:11:17.617]  You're not doing anything illegal.
[01:11:18.057 --> 01:11:21.501]  This is a public sidewalk, a public New York City street.
[01:11:21.721 --> 01:11:24.683]  Now this is Port Authority property, and the building is Port Authority property.
[01:11:25.064 --> 01:11:27.266]  We're not protesters.
[01:11:27.406 --> 01:11:29.788]  You found the video already?
[01:11:29.868 --> 01:11:30.168]  Good.
[01:11:30.188 --> 01:11:31.349]  What you got?
[01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:32.551]  Let me smile.
[01:11:32.611 --> 01:11:33.551]  Let me get locked up.
[01:11:42.759 --> 01:11:44.380]  Sir, this is New York City Street.
[01:11:44.501 --> 01:11:45.822]  This is Port Authority, even.
[01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:47.383]  It wasn't burning for three days.
[01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:48.804]  Sir, just one second.
[01:12:09.747 --> 01:12:11.568]  See, Larry don't want to hear that.
[01:12:11.588 --> 01:12:12.549]  I know Larry, but who's Larry?
[01:12:12.589 --> 01:12:13.670]  Larry's not above the law.
[01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:14.490]  We're citizens.
[01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.911]  We're Americans.
[01:12:15.011 --> 01:12:16.131]  And you can't record this.
[01:12:16.232 --> 01:12:17.152]  You have to have the law.
[01:12:17.172 --> 01:12:18.493]  You can't be recording this.
[01:12:18.513 --> 01:12:18.853]  Turn that off.
[01:12:18.873 --> 01:12:20.014]  It's a public sidewalk, though.
[01:12:20.875 --> 01:12:23.917]  Can I ask you why you're shaking my picture?
[01:12:23.997 --> 01:12:25.418]  I have every right to.
[01:12:25.438 --> 01:12:26.779]  You're on a public sidewalk.
[01:12:26.899 --> 01:12:29.341]  I'm a citizen.
[01:12:29.421 --> 01:12:29.921]  Hey, buddy.
[01:12:30.041 --> 01:12:32.483]  We were out here before, so I don't mean no disrespect.
[01:12:32.543 --> 01:12:34.064]  Can you take your camera out of my face?
[01:12:34.104 --> 01:12:35.625]  Because you're disrespecting me by doing that.
[01:12:36.423 --> 01:12:38.904]  Sir, I'm not doing anything illegal.
[01:12:38.944 --> 01:12:43.306]  No, I'm asking you politely, can you take that camera out of my face?
[01:12:43.346 --> 01:12:44.626]  You're disrespecting me!
[01:12:44.666 --> 01:12:45.647]  That's all, right?
[01:12:45.667 --> 01:12:47.367]  It's not, right?
[01:12:47.407 --> 01:12:49.568]  Come on, you gotta shut that off.
[01:12:49.588 --> 01:12:52.429]  We have every right to, though.
[01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:56.271]  We're not doing anything illegal, we have every right to.
[01:12:56.311 --> 01:12:57.291]  Shut that off!
[01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:58.812]  That's what I was saying.
[01:13:08.563 --> 01:13:11.204]  When Ricky comes, I think he's got a bomb in his bag.
[01:13:11.284 --> 01:13:12.064]  Exactly.
[01:13:12.505 --> 01:13:15.106]  I saw wires coming out of there.
[01:13:15.146 --> 01:13:20.207]  I think he's got a bomb in his bag.
[01:13:20.247 --> 01:13:21.248]  Terrorism?
[01:13:21.288 --> 01:13:23.889]  We're not terrorists.
[01:13:23.929 --> 01:13:25.249]  We're Americans.
[01:13:25.369 --> 01:13:26.070]  You're right.
[01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:29.551]  By the time the government figures it out, you'll be in a hole for 30 days.
[01:13:29.611 --> 01:13:32.332]  There's no record of what he's saying.
[01:13:32.492 --> 01:13:33.593]  No record of what I'm saying?
[01:13:35.399 --> 01:13:36.080]  I know.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:36.460]  Yes.
[01:13:37.081 --> 01:13:38.703]  We do have a job.
[01:13:39.083 --> 01:13:40.785]  I do have a job, sir.
[01:13:40.805 --> 01:13:42.787]  Don't record us.
[01:13:43.167 --> 01:13:44.148]  Don't record us.
[01:13:44.168 --> 01:13:45.950]  Power go to you guys.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.121]  Is that camera on, sir?
[01:13:59.641 --> 01:14:01.203]  Is that camera on?
[01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:02.223]  Is it on?
[01:14:02.243 --> 01:14:03.304]  Let it off.
[01:14:03.464 --> 01:14:09.269]  I mean, this is a public sidewalk, a public street.
[01:14:09.289 --> 01:14:10.390]  This is a public street.
[01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:11.511]  That's a public street.
[01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:14.013]  This is also a public street.
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.481]  I'm on a public street.
[01:14:19.501 --> 01:14:20.761]  Am I allowed to film here?
[01:14:20.841 --> 01:14:21.141]  Huh?
[01:14:21.201 --> 01:14:22.802]  Am I allowed to film on a public street?
[01:14:22.822 --> 01:14:24.082]  Put the camera down.
[01:14:24.242 --> 01:14:24.462]  Huh?
[01:14:24.643 --> 01:14:25.843]  Put the camera down.
[01:14:25.863 --> 01:14:27.043]  Am I allowed to film this?
[01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:28.264]  Put the camera down.
[01:14:28.324 --> 01:14:30.045]  Put the camera down.
[01:14:30.125 --> 01:14:31.005]  Put the camera down.
[01:14:31.045 --> 01:14:33.326]  Well, sir, I'm not breaking any laws, sir.
[01:14:33.346 --> 01:14:34.426]  Am I allowed to be here?
[01:14:34.446 --> 01:14:35.507]  You're still reporting me.
[01:14:35.547 --> 01:14:36.087]  Come on, man.
[01:14:36.127 --> 01:14:37.788]  You have every right to, sir.
[01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:40.909]  I'm sorry, but constitutionally, legally, you have every right to.
[01:14:41.937 --> 01:14:42.637]  I know my rights.
[01:14:42.717 --> 01:14:44.678]  I've been working at the ASLU before.
[01:14:45.119 --> 01:14:46.439]  And I have every right to.
[01:14:46.479 --> 01:14:49.161]  Guess who's going to jail?
[01:14:49.301 --> 01:14:50.721]  Guess who's going to jail?
[01:14:51.102 --> 01:14:52.462]  Alright.
[01:14:52.522 --> 01:14:52.883]  Hit pause.
[01:14:52.923 --> 01:14:56.084]  We're going to back that up a little bit.
[01:15:04.326 --> 01:15:05.766]  Guess who's going to jail?
[01:15:05.927 --> 01:15:07.487]  Look, he's got a bum!
[01:15:07.507 --> 01:15:08.827]  He starts calling the police.
[01:15:09.067 --> 01:15:10.708]  Look, we've got a bum here!
[01:15:10.728 --> 01:15:12.749]  And Luke's being so nice.
[01:15:12.789 --> 01:15:13.809]  Hey, I don't mean any disrespect.
[01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:15.249]  You're disrespecting me!
[01:15:15.469 --> 01:15:16.130]  I told you!
[01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:17.170]  Turn it off!
[01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:22.672]  And when you're done doing that, get over to my house and mow my lawn, you scum citizen!
[01:15:22.832 --> 01:15:24.272]  You work for us now!
[01:15:24.552 --> 01:15:26.413]  I've got the anti-terror laws!
[01:15:26.973 --> 01:15:29.234]  We're gonna run all of you into the ground!
[01:15:29.514 --> 01:15:32.255]  It's so much fun to kill America!
[01:15:32.575 --> 01:15:33.375]  Oh, yeah!
[01:15:34.517 --> 01:15:37.083]  The Founding Fathers, I saw one blogger say.
[01:15:37.103 --> 01:15:39.328]  I'll tell you about it when we get back.
[01:15:53.076 --> 01:15:56.618]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:15:56.678 --> 01:15:57.178]  are located?
[01:15:57.378 --> 01:16:00.781]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:16:01.001 --> 01:16:05.684]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[01:16:53.095 --> 01:16:55.737]  Is your child disrespectful, defiant, or obnoxious?
[01:16:56.057 --> 01:16:58.259]  Does everything turn into an argument with your kid?
[01:16:58.579 --> 01:17:00.301]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman.

[01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:20.638]  If you say those words, they stop arguing.
[01:17:20.698 --> 01:17:25.965]  Defiance, backtalking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.

[01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:54.751]  This is Elizabeth Border.
[01:17:55.292 --> 01:17:55.972]  News alert!
[01:17:56.473 --> 01:18:00.717]  Twice a month you can now get the Divided Kingdom's brand new newsletter.
[01:18:01.117 --> 01:18:01.698]  Concise?
[01:18:01.998 --> 01:18:02.619]  Hard-hitting?
[01:18:02.959 --> 01:18:05.902]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[01:18:06.242 --> 01:18:07.464]  War in Iran?
[01:18:07.964 --> 01:18:09.626]  A coming One World Church?
[01:18:10.386 --> 01:18:15.672]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.
[01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:23.640]  For a free sample copy of the Divided Kingdom dossier, write to Post Office Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland, 21609.

[01:18:52.505 --> 01:18:59.010]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:03.253]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:19:03.514 --> 01:19:05.655]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[01:19:06.036 --> 01:19:13.061]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[01:19:13.361 --> 01:19:15.963]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[01:19:16.243 --> 01:19:19.726]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[01:19:20.006 --> 01:19:27.892]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:19:28.293 --> 01:19:29.794]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:19:30.054 --> 01:19:44.666]  You'll find Nonex Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[01:19:45.146 --> 01:19:50.548]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:57.931]  You're listening to GCN.
[01:19:57.971 --> 01:20:00.552]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:20:01.052 --> 01:20:02.533]  Truth.
[01:20:04.614 --> 01:20:06.875]  Exposing corruption.
[01:20:07.455 --> 01:20:11.096]  Dismantling the false left-right paradigm.
[01:20:11.176 --> 01:20:12.637]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:14.860]  I gotta say this, though.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:20.322]  In places like Texas, you hear about cops getting prosecuted all the time for doing really petty things.
[01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:24.504]  But not in Chicago, not in New York, not in L.A.
[01:20:24.544 --> 01:20:25.744]  I mean, I read the news wires.
[01:20:26.384 --> 01:20:30.166]  Murder for hire, Boston, drug dealing, frame-ups.
[01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:33.227]  I mean, they are the mafia in those cities.
[01:20:33.547 --> 01:20:34.587]  And that's what tyranny's like.
[01:20:34.627 --> 01:20:36.868]  It's when criminals run things.
[01:20:37.188 --> 01:20:39.069]  That's the norm in human societies.
[01:20:39.787 --> 01:20:41.648]  And there's no doubt these guys are committing crimes.
[01:20:41.828 --> 01:20:44.049]  I mean, they start saying, he's got a bomb, he's got a bomb.
[01:20:44.569 --> 01:20:47.290]  And Luke says, you know, I don't have a bomb, and you know that's not true.
[01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:50.911]  And he goes, yeah, I know that's... I have the exact quote, let me find it.
[01:20:52.451 --> 01:20:57.613]  Yeah, that's true, but by the time the government finds out, you'll be in the hole 30 days.
[01:20:58.974 --> 01:21:01.775]  And let's cut back to this whole exchange.
[01:21:01.795 --> 01:21:03.855]  There's like 15 minutes more of it, but I'm not going to air it all.
[01:21:04.095 --> 01:21:05.536]  Here's the last minute and a half of it.
[01:21:06.491 --> 01:21:12.639]  Where police in modern America now, ladies and gentlemen, on camera say they're going to frame you.
[01:21:13.179 --> 01:21:20.889]  And they did go ahead and arrest him, but then some cooler head police showed up after an hour and higher-ups and said release him because they're
[01:21:21.571 --> 01:21:26.296]  I know you boys are having a little bit of fun, but we'll have to get him later.
[01:21:27.057 --> 01:21:28.118]  Let's go ahead and go to the tape.
[01:21:28.678 --> 01:21:30.260]  Guess who's going to jail?
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.701]  Guess who's going to jail?
[01:21:40.334 --> 01:21:41.695]  I think.
[01:21:41.755 --> 01:21:45.878]  How are you going to say that, sir?
[01:21:45.918 --> 01:21:46.559]  That's a slander.
[01:21:46.579 --> 01:21:48.080]  I saw wires coming out of it.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.821]  I don't know what you have in there.
[01:21:50.401 --> 01:21:50.822]  I don't know.
[01:21:50.842 --> 01:21:53.023]  You look like a terrorist may look like.
[01:21:53.083 --> 01:21:54.344]  I don't know what a terrorist looks like.
[01:21:54.364 --> 01:21:55.905]  Sir, that's very disrespectful.
[01:21:55.925 --> 01:21:57.146]  I don't know what a terrorist looks like.
[01:21:57.186 --> 01:21:58.727]  You may look like a terrorist for all I know.
[01:21:58.747 --> 01:21:59.608]  How are you going to say that?
[01:21:59.768 --> 01:22:00.829]  We're not doing anything to you.
[01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:02.750]  You've got wires coming out of the backpack.
[01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:03.791]  I'm not a terrorist, sir.
[01:22:03.811 --> 01:22:05.812]  You've made threats, so now I'm concerned.
[01:22:05.992 --> 01:22:06.973]  Nobody made a threat.
[01:22:08.374 --> 01:22:09.315]  Never made a threat, sir.
[01:22:09.335 --> 01:22:11.558]  What you're doing right now is slanderous.
[01:22:12.079 --> 01:22:12.739]  And it's libel.
[01:22:12.759 --> 01:22:13.681]  Let the judge decide that.
[01:22:13.701 --> 01:22:14.662]  You have no right to do that.
[01:22:16.384 --> 01:22:20.929]  Can we talk to the guys, or?
[01:22:20.949 --> 01:22:24.774]  About what we're doing, or?
[01:22:24.874 --> 01:22:25.154]  Alright.
[01:22:25.675 --> 01:22:26.236]  Just let us know.
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:27.800]  How you doing, sir?
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:28.480]  How are you doing?
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:29.120]  How's everything?
[01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:30.521]  Finally get to talk to you again.
[01:22:30.601 --> 01:22:32.621]  Okay, I had to find that through my homework.
[01:22:32.801 --> 01:22:46.524]  Okay, just to make you understand, we were out here about a month ago, and the Port Authority police officer came, we have it on record, we have it on camera also, and he said that this is private property, and that is private property, but as far as going to this goes, this is Redmond Street, and this is New York City property.
[01:22:46.584 --> 01:22:47.605]  It's considered a courtyard.
[01:22:47.645 --> 01:22:49.405]  New York City public property.
[01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:53.606]  And therefore we could be here, and a month ago... Except over there, that's actually his property.
[01:22:53.906 --> 01:22:55.286]  That street over there.
[01:22:55.307 --> 01:22:56.907]  That street's public.
[01:22:56.927 --> 01:23:11.351]  About a month ago, we were out here and the police officers... Alright, it goes on and on, and then suddenly those police, and this is caught on video from across the street, you can see it on tape, grab the video camera, grab his cell phone, and go, look, a gun!
[01:23:11.991 --> 01:23:13.052]  Look, we got it!
[01:23:13.312 --> 01:23:16.673]  And they start holding up the... I mean, talk about goons.
[01:23:18.306 --> 01:23:18.946]  Talk about good.
[01:23:18.986 --> 01:23:26.009]  It's all about catching the public, getting the public in the system, in the big prisons, predominantly owned by large banks that launder the drug money.
[01:23:26.209 --> 01:23:26.710]  Let me explain it.
[01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:33.333]  The drug dealing mafia owns the government and owns the prisons that they put drug users in.
[01:23:34.193 --> 01:23:37.154]  So they make money shipping it in and they make money shipping it out.
[01:23:37.474 --> 01:23:39.335]  Guess who's going to jail?
[01:23:39.355 --> 01:23:40.716]  Guess who's going to jail?
[01:23:44.479 --> 01:23:46.200]  I mean, folks, you cannot make this up.
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:47.201]  And there's more of it.
[01:23:47.281 --> 01:23:51.164]  Dancing around, going, he's got a bomb, I know he does!
[01:23:51.644 --> 01:23:52.885]  I mean, imagine!
[01:23:53.025 --> 01:23:54.866]  Let me tell you Luke's story.
[01:23:56.548 --> 01:23:58.789]  Luke's parents were anti-communist in Poland.
[01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:02.752]  And, you know, he had family that got arrested and disappeared and all that stuff.
[01:24:02.772 --> 01:24:03.833]  And he was like a little kid.
[01:24:03.913 --> 01:24:04.233]  He's only 20.
[01:24:04.293 --> 01:24:05.234]  He got involved when he was 19.
[01:24:05.274 --> 01:24:05.594]  He's 21 now.
[01:24:07.888 --> 01:24:16.651]  And Luke saw my film Police State 2000, and then he saw things like that in New York, and he was going to school, a good student, never been in trouble, and the cops beat him up in New York.
[01:24:17.112 --> 01:24:25.915]  Then he went online to find out about the police state when he was like 18, and he found me, and he found the material we put out, and now he's a 9-11 truther, and he's having a great effect.
[01:24:26.435 --> 01:24:34.718]  But imagine his family coming from Poland, coming from serious, hardcore Soviet tyranny, and they're seeing the exact same thing here now.
[01:24:35.638 --> 01:24:36.059]  But I mean,
[01:24:37.617 --> 01:24:40.299]  The Polish Secret Police, I don't know if they danced around and giggled about it.
[01:24:40.379 --> 01:24:43.402]  I mean, that was the scary thing about the Nazis and the Soviets.
[01:24:43.422 --> 01:24:44.542]  They were kind of cold-blooded about it.
[01:24:44.582 --> 01:24:47.044]  This is just like... It's like a cartoon.
[01:24:47.885 --> 01:24:53.970]  But, like I said, they'll just stop having, um... We'll just stop even having precincts.
[01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:55.371]  You know, I'm with the 127.
[01:24:55.991 --> 01:24:57.232]  No, my family's the 249.
[01:24:57.272 --> 01:25:00.715]  Come on over to the family.
[01:25:01.555 --> 01:25:03.457]  Don't you disrespecting my family?
[01:25:03.477 --> 01:25:07.340]  And... It's just so scary.
[01:25:08.334 --> 01:25:11.875]  To see them openly trying to frame somebody on the streets of New York.
[01:25:13.395 --> 01:25:19.517]  And they just kept saying, turn the camera off, turn it off, and things will go a lot better as soon as you turn it off.
[01:25:20.537 --> 01:25:23.658]  And as soon as they did turn it off, they grabbed it away from them.
[01:25:24.358 --> 01:25:28.679]  And then, I mean imagine, people are hearing the cops say there's a bomb three times.
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:32.041]  Could have caused other police to run up and pull their guns.
[01:25:32.081 --> 01:25:33.122]  Could have caused people to panic.
[01:25:33.142 --> 01:25:33.862]  Could have caused anything.
[01:25:34.162 --> 01:25:37.283]  But see, again, it's going to be selectively enforced and nothing's going to happen to them.
[01:25:37.624 --> 01:25:38.404]  And don't worry, folks.
[01:25:38.464 --> 01:25:39.745]  It's just going to get worse and worse.
[01:25:39.785 --> 01:25:40.765]  Go ahead and accept it.
[01:25:40.785 --> 01:25:41.866]  Go ahead and go along with it.
[01:25:42.186 --> 01:25:43.466]  Go ahead and accept it, America.
[01:25:43.707 --> 01:25:45.227]  Police, I want you to go along with it.
[01:25:45.928 --> 01:25:53.271]  Because the same New World Order is going to take your pension funds when your kid's 18 months old and you give them the third round of shots full of mercury and they're having a seizure in the car.
[01:25:53.811 --> 01:25:55.452]  You know, you didn't listen to us.
[01:25:56.132 --> 01:25:59.314]  You didn't listen to us on the New World Order or the North American Union or any of it.
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:06.284]  And so you go ahead and believe the system, drink your aspartame, drink your aluminum, you know, lined cans, drink stuff out of that.
[01:26:07.565 --> 01:26:11.268]  Just believe the government and do everything they say and don't believe me.
[01:26:11.368 --> 01:26:11.628]  Okay?
[01:26:11.928 --> 01:26:12.769]  Let's make it easy.
[01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:15.971]  Just, just, just, just don't agree with us.
[01:26:16.472 --> 01:26:17.132]  We're bad.
[01:26:17.292 --> 01:26:18.233]  We're un-American.
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:44.634]  And having secret police is good, and having 20 plus billion in fake news be purchased secretly, and tens of thousands of reporters on the government payroll secretly is good, and FEMA camps being built openly is good, and Dying Corp and Halliburton openly in the newspaper running child kidnapping rings is good, and it's all good and I'm bad, and the honeybees all dying is good, and genetic engineered foods filled with amino acids and toxins we can't absorb is good, and everything is just good.
[01:26:44.694 --> 01:26:44.914]  Okay?
[01:26:45.857 --> 01:26:46.258]  Okay, good.
[01:26:46.518 --> 01:26:47.499]  I'm glad it's all good now.
[01:26:47.979 --> 01:26:50.342]  And you can just, you know, I'm a crazy man, I'm a liar.
[01:26:50.602 --> 01:26:53.145]  Cops framing people is good on videotape.
[01:26:53.325 --> 01:26:56.308]  See, they've always done it in secret, but now it's just right out in the open.
[01:26:56.488 --> 01:26:58.190]  Because Jack Bauer does it, it must be okay.
[01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:00.112]  Again, a Pentagon-produced program.
[01:27:00.853 --> 01:27:02.374]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:27:02.394 --> 01:27:03.976]  We have people holding for eons.
[01:27:04.436 --> 01:27:04.817]  Ross?
[01:27:05.624 --> 01:27:07.085]  In California.
[01:27:07.225 --> 01:27:08.106]  You're on the air.
[01:27:08.146 --> 01:27:08.547]  Go ahead.
[01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:09.808]  Hello, Alex!
[01:27:09.888 --> 01:27:10.648]  Hello, go ahead.
[01:27:11.169 --> 01:27:13.430]  Hey, this is Ross Marshall.
[01:27:14.331 --> 01:27:16.093]  Run weirdvideos.com.
[01:27:16.353 --> 01:27:17.674]  I was in contact with you.
[01:27:17.714 --> 01:27:18.595]  I don't know.
[01:27:18.995 --> 01:27:22.478]  You know, you've been holding forever, sir, and then I just lost your call.
[01:27:23.278 --> 01:27:23.739]  It dropped.
[01:27:24.079 --> 01:27:26.341]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:27:27.101 --> 01:27:30.564]  Let's talk to TJ in New York.
[01:27:30.684 --> 01:27:31.685]  You're on the air.
[01:27:31.745 --> 01:27:32.085]  Welcome.
[01:27:32.846 --> 01:27:33.707]  How you doing today, Alex?
[01:27:33.747 --> 01:27:33.947]  Good.
[01:27:34.597 --> 01:27:35.239]  I give you a call.
[01:27:35.259 --> 01:27:36.462]  I don't know if you got the chance to hear.
[01:27:36.502 --> 01:27:42.879]  I heard on a news report yesterday that a chemical called Procarly that's used in rocket fuel
[01:27:43.484 --> 01:27:45.546]  ...has been showing up in the country's water supply.
[01:27:45.887 --> 01:27:57.138]  Sir, MBTE, that the environmentalists demanded be put in all the gasoline 15 years ago, is in 49 states at high levels, is a deadly carcinogen and we're all drinking it.
[01:27:57.538 --> 01:27:59.901]  But yes, I did see the nutritious rocket fuel story.
[01:28:00.261 --> 01:28:06.848]  But if you criticize that or protest, we'll just send some cops over from Don Carleone to say you have a bomb.
[01:28:07.885 --> 01:28:13.833]  They did a test where they said they took 3,000 people that represented the population of the United States, all 3,000 tested positively.
[01:28:17.648 --> 01:28:19.149]  Well, but again, that doesn't matter.
[01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:25.250]  We need a global tax for non-man-made global warming that isn't even real to the IMF and World Bank.
[01:28:25.330 --> 01:28:26.091]  That will save us.
[01:28:26.331 --> 01:28:35.333]  See, that's so they can have all the phony environmentalists have something to do while all these real problems, toxics, chemicals, nobody should be drinking out of plastic, but we all do it.
[01:28:35.353 --> 01:28:42.875]  The dioxins makes the women feminine, makes the women over-feminine, directly linked to the breast cancer, directly linked to men being effeminate.
[01:28:44.019 --> 01:28:48.861]  The men aren't developing as fast, and the women are going into puberty when they're nine.
[01:28:50.321 --> 01:28:50.801]  That's true.
[01:28:51.442 --> 01:28:52.582]  It's just like the frogs.
[01:28:52.642 --> 01:28:55.203]  The frogs aren't either, because they're in the same water.
[01:28:55.863 --> 01:28:59.144]  They've got large portions of the country's frog population.
[01:28:59.164 --> 01:29:04.146]  I mean, in some ponds, half of them are, oh, what's the term where you're both sexes?
[01:29:05.111 --> 01:29:05.611]  Asexual.
[01:29:05.932 --> 01:29:06.812]  Yeah, hermaphrodites.
[01:29:06.872 --> 01:29:16.239]  I mean, it's... Oh, but it's... But let's not worry about that or the fact that BT Monsanto corn has a pesticide in it that's authorized for humans to eat that's killing all the honeybees.
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:18.461]  Let's just have a global tax.
[01:29:18.781 --> 01:29:19.622]  That'll do something.
[01:29:19.662 --> 01:29:20.182]  Anything else?
[01:29:20.202 --> 01:29:21.463]  That's it, Alex.
[01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:21.984]  Thanks a lot.
[01:29:22.464 --> 01:29:23.905]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:24.686]  Thank you for holding.
[01:29:24.706 --> 01:29:30.350]  TJ, Paul, Pauline, everybody else, your calls are straight ahead in the final segment.
[01:29:30.370 --> 01:29:32.632]  We'll take four or five more calls, blitz through the news,
[01:29:33.602 --> 01:29:35.925]  On the war, on the economy, and a lot more.
[01:29:36.346 --> 01:29:38.188]  Don't forget my film Terror Storm.
[01:29:38.549 --> 01:29:40.251]  It's available for free at Google Video.
[01:29:40.531 --> 01:29:41.413]  Terror Storm.
[01:29:41.473 --> 01:29:44.877]  Google it and spread the link today and expose the real terrorists.
[01:29:45.097 --> 01:29:46.339]  We're going to defend the Republic.
[01:29:46.519 --> 01:29:47.761]  We're going to save America.
[01:29:52.794 --> 01:29:55.716]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:29:55.876 --> 01:30:01.140]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:06.724]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:30:07.124 --> 01:30:08.205]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:08.605 --> 01:30:17.410]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:19.511]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:30:19.771 --> 01:30:28.596]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:30:28.996 --> 01:30:29.857]  Start saving over $1,000!
[01:30:29.977 --> 01:30:30.177]  Call 1-800-340-7091.
[01:30:53.677 --> 01:30:55.377]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:30:55.677 --> 01:30:58.518]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[01:30:58.998 --> 01:31:01.218]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[01:31:01.838 --> 01:31:10.120]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:11.160]  An example?
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:14.541]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[01:31:15.421 --> 01:31:18.181]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[01:31:18.541 --> 01:31:21.822]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:27.783]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[01:31:28.424 --> 01:31:29.905]  Money is not the problem.
[01:31:30.125 --> 01:31:31.126]  Availability is.
[01:31:31.626 --> 01:31:33.507]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[01:31:33.747 --> 01:31:37.430]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:40.131]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:40.171 --> 01:31:41.192]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:41.212 --> 01:31:41.252]  800-409-5633.
[01:31:54.657 --> 01:32:05.931]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:32:06.132 --> 01:32:09.616]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[01:32:09.896 --> 01:32:10.336]  We're good to go!
[01:32:35.854 --> 01:32:37.936]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[01:32:38.016 --> 01:32:39.977]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[01:32:40.017 --> 01:32:40.618]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.
[01:32:40.738 --> 01:32:40.978]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:32:41.058 --> 01:32:42.619]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:32:42.679 --> 01:32:43.640]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:32:53.044 --> 01:32:54.785]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:32:54.925 --> 01:32:56.165]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:32:56.405 --> 01:32:59.226]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.

[01:34:05.488 --> 01:34:08.509]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[01:34:09.329 --> 01:34:11.710]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:18.953 --> 01:34:22.374]  Alright, it's the final segment of this 29th of April 2007 edition.
[01:34:26.036 --> 01:34:33.340]  Anyone who could defend the police trying to violate someone's First Amendment by framing them for a bomb.
[01:34:36.022 --> 01:34:46.808]  And by the way, up on our message boards and up on the DIG message board where thousands of comments were posted on this the last two days, about 20% are, yeah, I wish the cops would just shoot you people.
[01:34:47.408 --> 01:34:48.989]  We need to ban your speech.
[01:34:50.599 --> 01:34:53.520]  Again, you're telling us to leave America and that we should be arrested?
[01:34:53.781 --> 01:34:55.281]  No, you need to get out of this country.
[01:34:55.701 --> 01:34:57.342]  You don't know what America is, you trash.
[01:34:58.422 --> 01:35:00.463]  Anyone who believes in that is absolute filth.
[01:35:00.783 --> 01:35:02.104]  Let's take a bunch of phone calls here.
[01:35:02.584 --> 01:35:04.044]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:35:04.084 --> 01:35:11.187]  Let's talk to... Phone systems on the fritz giving me the same name multiple times, but that's okay.
[01:35:11.207 --> 01:35:12.448]  Let's talk to Pauline.
[01:35:13.148 --> 01:35:15.469]  Pauline, you are on the air.
[01:35:15.589 --> 01:35:15.929]  Welcome.
[01:35:16.823 --> 01:35:21.324]  Yes, I was just wanting to know why the Veteran Administration is not doing the best for their soldiers.
[01:35:22.304 --> 01:35:23.664]  I've been hearing a lot of bad things.
[01:35:24.044 --> 01:35:25.625]  Well, they never take care of the soldiers.
[01:35:25.705 --> 01:35:42.768]  I mean, as much as I liked General MacArthur, back when he was a colonel, him and a fellow who was also in kind of the same tank command, that'd be Eisenhower, rode over a bunch of people with horses and killed a bunch of bonus strikers, never got their pension.
[01:35:43.228 --> 01:35:45.029]  They only tell the troops they care about them.
[01:35:45.069 --> 01:35:46.669]  That's only for public consumption.
[01:35:47.386 --> 01:35:51.147]  They've never made our troops, though, serve five terms, which they're now doing.
[01:35:51.207 --> 01:35:51.828]  Five tours.
[01:35:52.928 --> 01:35:58.510]  I mean, that's like driving a car until the tire is like a millimeter thick, way past the steel belts.
[01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.590]  It'll blow.
[01:36:00.491 --> 01:36:04.092]  Most people, even one tour of serious combat, are going to have problems for life, but no.
[01:36:04.532 --> 01:36:05.192]  Not our troops.
[01:36:05.252 --> 01:36:06.253]  Four or five tours.
[01:36:06.673 --> 01:36:09.774]  They also make them pay for their food now when their arms and legs are blown off.
[01:36:09.794 --> 01:36:12.715]  They make them pay to be flown back from Rammstein in Germany.
[01:36:14.102 --> 01:36:18.265]  Uh, in fact, I've even helped collect money for troops to get flown back when they're... because they discharge you.
[01:36:18.285 --> 01:36:19.446]  They just kick you out of the hospital.
[01:36:19.667 --> 01:36:20.788]  Ah, your legs are blown off.
[01:36:20.828 --> 01:36:21.708]  Get on out of here.
[01:36:22.349 --> 01:36:23.270]  That's how it works.
[01:36:23.370 --> 01:36:26.533]  And all these people with all these stickers all over their cars just feel good.
[01:36:26.833 --> 01:36:30.717]  Sticking those stickers on your car just means you're for sticking them in a meat grinder, forgetting about them.
[01:36:31.157 --> 01:36:31.437]  Okay?
[01:36:31.497 --> 01:36:34.440]  And stick another plastic flag made in China by slaves on your car.
[01:36:34.941 --> 01:36:35.521]  Go to sleep.
[01:36:35.581 --> 01:36:36.322]  Everything's fine.
[01:36:37.276 --> 01:36:44.197]  Let the troops be given experimental deadly vaccines, let them breathe depleted uranium when the Army manual says it'll kill them, and then don't take care of them once they get back.
[01:36:44.217 --> 01:36:46.278]  Don't give them... just like the firemen and police.
[01:36:46.958 --> 01:36:53.379]  You know, Giuliani's down there in a spacesuit along with the EPA, but tell the firemen and police, oh, it's fine for you.
[01:36:54.219 --> 01:36:55.679]  It's fine, it's nutritious.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.640]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dory in New Jersey.
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:00.600]  Dory, you're on the air.
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:01.040]  Go ahead.
[01:37:02.901 --> 01:37:03.621]  Hello, Dory.
[01:37:04.021 --> 01:37:04.321]  Hello.
[01:37:04.541 --> 01:37:05.241]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:37:05.919 --> 01:37:07.079]  Oh, no, this is Billy.
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:09.120]  Okay, my calls are scrambled here.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:10.560]  Go ahead, just go ahead and talk.
[01:37:11.481 --> 01:37:16.222]  No, no, I'm calling from Bergen County, New Jersey, you know, where the police chief wants as well to be implanted with RFID.
[01:37:16.262 --> 01:37:30.286]  That's right, I interviewed the Bergen County police chief, there they have a police chief for the county, and he said that everyone should be forced to take a chip, I have the recording on my website, and that he is for arresting anyone that doesn't take it, and yes, uh-huh, sure, go ahead.
[01:37:31.425 --> 01:37:35.910]  Oh, anyway, I called back on March 18th about the global war on propaganda that was being told in my high school.
[01:37:36.071 --> 01:37:36.391]  Yes.
[01:37:36.992 --> 01:37:42.258]  Anyway, I wanted to talk about how pathetic it is that our school wants us to start wearing ID shirts for so-called security.
[01:37:42.682 --> 01:37:49.345]  Meanwhile, there are like tons of fights each week at our school, and just two weeks ago, a student deliberately lit a teacher's chair on fire.
[01:37:49.565 --> 01:37:57.088]  I mean... Well, what they do is give up all your rights to fight Al-Qaeda, but ignore all the illegal aliens, and they don't have to have IDs to get bank accounts, and the cops are told to leave them alone.
[01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:58.089]  I mean, it's all a joke.
[01:37:58.529 --> 01:38:02.551]  Or, take a... wear an ID chip, and the police chief wants you to have a chip,
[01:38:02.851 --> 01:38:04.932]  That's how we stand up against global warming.
[01:38:05.153 --> 01:38:07.714]  Yeah, I mean, it's just all an excuse for tyranny.
[01:38:07.914 --> 01:38:09.395]  They've already sucked out the economy.
[01:38:09.415 --> 01:38:10.616]  They've already destroyed the dollar.
[01:38:10.836 --> 01:38:13.118]  Foreign corporations already own the United States.
[01:38:13.398 --> 01:38:18.702]  Now they've got to set up the police state, because when they finally announce it to people, the public's going to be mad.
[01:38:18.982 --> 01:38:20.583]  That's what's happened, America!
[01:38:20.843 --> 01:38:21.383]  Okay?
[01:38:21.604 --> 01:38:22.624]  It's really bad!
[01:38:22.644 --> 01:38:24.245]  Anyway, hello?
[01:38:24.445 --> 01:38:24.946]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:29.769]  Yeah, anyway, I just want to inform all students to go against the ID cards and just
[01:38:30.168 --> 01:38:30.669]  We're good to go.
[01:38:38.248 --> 01:38:43.433]  And now, because of Bush's No Child Left Behind, I mean, it's kind of like sucking old schools that aren't thoroughly or fairly owned.
[01:38:43.714 --> 01:38:46.597]  Exactly, and how did No Child Left Behind get passed?
[01:38:46.817 --> 01:39:01.472]  Over a billion dollars in a one-year period was spent secretly for fake newscasts, fake infomercials, that is where they didn't even tell you they were infomercials, and hundreds and hundreds of reporters we know of were paid off to go report it, like Armstrong Williams.
[01:39:02.341 --> 01:39:13.473]  Too bad, I've been on the guy's show many times, but he was on the payroll $244,000 to go out and push the federalization of schooling.
[01:39:13.533 --> 01:39:19.860]  By the way, this new hate law that will start banning free speech that they're going to set to vote on Thursday, the Democrats are, that Bush says they'll sign.
[01:39:20.968 --> 01:39:23.570]  That really federalizes local police completely.
[01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:26.772]  Man, I mean, folks, it is so bad what's happening.
[01:39:26.832 --> 01:39:28.233]  David in Austin.
[01:39:28.273 --> 01:39:29.994]  I guess he's a KLBJ 590 listener.
[01:39:30.274 --> 01:39:31.295]  David, you're on the air.
[01:39:31.315 --> 01:39:31.675]  Go ahead.
[01:39:32.055 --> 01:39:33.016]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:39:33.096 --> 01:39:33.376]  Good.
[01:39:33.836 --> 01:39:41.381]  Hey, well, I just listened to a comment about the military making soldiers pay to fly back from Ramstein.
[01:39:41.421 --> 01:39:43.842]  Yep, it's been in the Associated Press and Reuters.
[01:39:44.803 --> 01:39:46.384]  Well, you know, they're
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:47.941]  Probably pretty much wrong.
[01:39:48.001 --> 01:39:51.724]  I'm Casualty Assistance, and I know that's pretty much a bold-faced lie.
[01:39:51.844 --> 01:39:54.706]  And there's nothing going on at Walter Reed either, and DU's good for you?
[01:39:54.747 --> 01:39:55.247]  No, no, no.
[01:39:55.387 --> 01:39:58.510]  I understand that Walter Reed does need some repair.
[01:39:58.630 --> 01:39:59.310]  I do understand.
[01:39:59.330 --> 01:40:00.191]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:40:00.852 --> 01:40:04.014]  Do they have to... Are soldiers, some of them, starting their fifth term?
[01:40:05.515 --> 01:40:05.956]  Uh, no.
[01:40:06.576 --> 01:40:07.877]  Okay, so I'm a liar there, too.
[01:40:08.077 --> 01:40:09.399]  No, no, you're not a liar.
[01:40:09.479 --> 01:40:11.000]  You might be misinformed.
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:13.302]  Oh, so they're not having... Hold on, let me stop you.
[01:40:13.382 --> 01:40:14.062]  Let me stop you.
[01:40:14.142 --> 01:40:15.063]  I'm going to put him on hold.
[01:40:17.052 --> 01:40:22.676]  No, we've been there four years and a month and so fourth tours have ended, fifth tours are beginning.
[01:40:23.177 --> 01:40:25.158]  That was in the Wall Street Journal a week ago.
[01:40:26.079 --> 01:40:26.539]  Okay?
[01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:33.645]  In fact, there were people there already doing a tour in Kuwait or in surrounding areas on standby a year before that.
[01:40:33.885 --> 01:40:42.091]  There are people that signed on for three and five year and ten year commitments that ended in 2003 that have been automatic re-up, stop-loss.
[01:40:42.171 --> 01:40:44.553]  It's a draft of those that have already served.
[01:40:45.074 --> 01:40:46.515]  So you say two or three tours.
[01:40:46.895 --> 01:40:49.256]  No, they're people starting their fifth tour.
[01:40:49.816 --> 01:40:54.119]  And I have interviewed the families of people who've been discharged and had to be flown back.
[01:40:54.159 --> 01:40:55.459]  Now, that was a couple years ago.
[01:40:55.699 --> 01:40:56.740]  They may have stopped that.
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:58.421]  And DU is deadly.
[01:40:58.481 --> 01:41:00.902]  I've interviewed Doug Rocky, who wrote the book for the Pentagon on it.
[01:41:01.062 --> 01:41:02.563]  Now, I'm going to go back to David.
[01:41:02.763 --> 01:41:03.423]  David, go ahead.
[01:41:04.184 --> 01:41:04.784]  Hi, Alex.
[01:41:04.924 --> 01:41:05.564]  How are you doing?
[01:41:05.644 --> 01:41:05.884]  Good.
[01:41:05.944 --> 01:41:09.966]  Now, go ahead and you show me where I'm wrong that people aren't starting their fifth tours.
[01:41:10.727 --> 01:41:12.948]  Well, I know there's no fifth tours.
[01:41:14.381 --> 01:41:15.342]  Being in the system.
[01:41:16.504 --> 01:41:18.026]  Okay, are there third tours?
[01:41:18.867 --> 01:41:22.872]  Now Alex, are you... Let's just say you're right, which you're not.
[01:41:23.432 --> 01:41:28.499]  Are there third tours and did we only make them have one tour in Vietnam or World War II or Korea?
[01:41:28.799 --> 01:41:30.842]  Okay, I want you to answer the question.
[01:41:31.342 --> 01:41:31.763]  Go ahead.
[01:41:33.186 --> 01:41:34.288]  No, there's no 5th Tours.
[01:41:34.568 --> 01:41:35.970]  What answer do you want?
[01:41:37.072 --> 01:41:37.873]  What's your question today, Alex?
[01:41:37.893 --> 01:41:39.455]  Did they only make you serve one tour in WWII or Vietnam?
[01:41:39.495 --> 01:41:40.296]  No, I was in Vietnam also.
[01:41:49.776 --> 01:41:55.217]  Oh, they made you serve four... You say they're not starting their fifth tour, which, by the way, anybody can Google and pull up.
[01:41:55.777 --> 01:41:57.537]  So how many tours have they been forced to do?
[01:41:57.818 --> 01:41:58.738]  Is there stop-loss?
[01:41:59.178 --> 01:42:00.398]  Yes, there is a stop-loss.
[01:42:00.478 --> 01:42:02.098]  Is that a draft of those that have already served?
[01:42:02.118 --> 01:42:03.079]  I'm a part of that stop-loss.
[01:42:03.979 --> 01:42:04.319]  Pardon me?
[01:42:04.839 --> 01:42:06.339]  I'm a part of that stop-loss.
[01:42:06.439 --> 01:42:12.520]  Okay, so people who won out, people who signed up for the Guard and have spent two, three years in front-line duty.
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:15.921]  Now, in the Guard, there's people that have been there for two tours.
[01:42:17.208 --> 01:42:19.890]  I'll tell you, the National Guard, there's people that have been there for two tours.
[01:42:19.970 --> 01:42:20.170]  Uh-huh.
[01:42:20.230 --> 01:42:22.112]  And there's no one starting their fifth tour?
[01:42:22.512 --> 01:42:23.533]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:42:23.613 --> 01:42:24.433]  How many tours, then?
[01:42:25.154 --> 01:42:25.314]  Huh?
[01:42:25.734 --> 01:42:26.615]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:42:26.695 --> 01:42:28.336]  Now, may I explain?
[01:42:28.396 --> 01:42:29.177]  Are you going to cut me off?
[01:42:29.197 --> 01:42:30.257]  Well, the show's about to end.
[01:42:30.277 --> 01:42:30.778]  Let me guess.
[01:42:31.078 --> 01:42:32.719]  Are you for the war, or do you think it's a great thing?
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.941]  I don't think any war is a great thing.
[01:42:35.121 --> 01:42:35.281]  Yeah.
[01:42:35.401 --> 01:42:36.842]  We've got to fight Al-Qaeda over there.
[01:42:37.022 --> 01:42:46.589]  Remember, we had to go over there because Saddam had WMDs, and then the White House memo comes out, this is admitted by the White House, where they admit there's no weapons and they're lying on purpose.
[01:42:47.410 --> 01:42:48.850]  Lying on purpose!
[01:42:50.011 --> 01:42:52.791]  Starting a war, and then now we can't leave because Al-Qaeda!
[01:42:53.031 --> 01:42:54.411]  It's a front line for Al-Qaeda!
[01:42:54.832 --> 01:42:55.592]  Pure bull!
[01:42:57.672 --> 01:42:58.572]  Al-Qaeda!
[01:42:58.872 --> 01:43:00.893]  Anyone who fights over there is called Al-Qaeda!
[01:43:02.393 --> 01:43:06.654]  And I guess those kids in New York, with the cops telling them they got bombs are Al-Qaeda too.
[01:43:07.234 --> 01:43:09.875]  I mean, my God, sir, this isn't our military.
[01:43:10.055 --> 01:43:11.455]  By the way, I remember when
[01:43:12.771 --> 01:43:20.522]  I remember when I would talk about Halliburton getting no-bid contracts, and you were programmed with the Neocon Talk Show to go, well, France don't deserve them.
[01:43:20.962 --> 01:43:21.523]  No, no, no, no.
[01:43:21.683 --> 01:43:25.769]  American companies weren't allowed to put bids in that Halliburton was given tens of billions a year.
[01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:27.672]  Well, now they've moved to Dubai.
[01:43:28.607 --> 01:43:29.488]  That's of the Arabs.
[01:43:29.888 --> 01:43:32.070]  And still I've heard you, well that's alright!
[01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:34.611]  We still deserve it!
[01:43:35.112 --> 01:43:40.916]  The head of the Naval War College, Thomas Barnett, says our military works for the New World Order.
[01:43:41.016 --> 01:43:41.696]  On C-SPAN.
[01:43:41.857 --> 01:43:44.218]  He says they don't work for the American people.
[01:43:44.418 --> 01:43:45.519]  Do you understand that?
[01:43:45.699 --> 01:43:47.401]  Can you get that through your head?
[01:43:48.741 --> 01:43:50.603]  Next he was going to tell me DU's nutritious.
[01:43:51.343 --> 01:43:52.104]  I'm out of time.
[01:43:52.204 --> 01:43:54.866]  We had Phil, James, I had all this news I wanted to cover.
[01:43:55.871 --> 01:43:56.892]  I'll just try to jam him in.
[01:43:56.992 --> 01:43:59.974]  Phil, you're on the air from Daytona.
[01:43:59.994 --> 01:44:00.375]  Go ahead.
[01:44:00.475 --> 01:44:05.379]  Yeah, a significant amount of chemtrails spraying in the Florida cities.
[01:44:05.519 --> 01:44:07.080]  I'd like to have some time with you.
[01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:08.881]  I left a voicemail with Kevin.
[01:44:09.922 --> 01:44:12.544]  Yeah, Kevin doesn't work at my office anymore, sir.
[01:44:12.624 --> 01:44:13.004]  Thank you.
[01:44:13.305 --> 01:44:15.286]  We're out of time here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:16.807 --> 01:44:17.668]  Oh my goodness.
[01:44:18.429 --> 01:44:21.991]  Good job to Trey in there today on the show.
[01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:27.050]  Ha ha, that's just so incredible.
[01:44:27.651 --> 01:44:29.791]  Fine, go ahead and believe George Bush is your God.
[01:44:30.171 --> 01:44:32.452]  And his amnesty plan isn't an amnesty plan.
[01:44:33.012 --> 01:44:36.193]  And the biggest federal budget ever, doubling what Bill Clinton did is no big deal.
[01:44:37.013 --> 01:44:39.494]  I mean, it's just, can you admit both parties are run by the New World Order?
[01:44:39.974 --> 01:44:40.634]  God bless you all.
[01:44:43.035 --> 01:44:47.276]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.

[01:45:19.344 --> 01:45:22.505]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:29.652]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
