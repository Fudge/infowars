[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:01.770]  What you're witnessing?
[00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.150]  Blacksburg, Virginia.
[00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:11.574]  I'm on the campus of Virginia Tech and woke up this morning to loudspeakers going off saying that there's a shooter on campus.
[00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:12.815]  Please stay inside.
[00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:18.777]  And they just put up this big loudspeaker system because we had another school shooting a while back.
[00:00:18.777 --> 00:00:23.900]  At the first day of the school year, a guy went nuts and shot a couple of cops.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.921]  This is the real deal.
[00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:28.742]  The first report was that there were two shooters
[00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.666]  Always the same, it's oh my god.
[00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.507]  Two shooters total.
[00:00:33.507 --> 00:00:34.968]  That was the first report.
[00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.229]  Oh my god.
[00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:50.500]  So then, basically what it's shaped into so far is that there was a guy who shot three people at AJ dorm, which is just, oh it's about a half mile from here, and then fled across campus, went into a classroom and killed everybody.
[00:00:52.262 --> 00:00:53.863]  And then killed himself is the word.
[00:00:53.863 --> 00:00:58.665]  And I bet money if the cops would have scrambled immediately, they could have seen this guy running around with a gun.
[00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:00.466]  They should have just attacked him.
[00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.827]  I just cannot believe it.
[00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:02.707]  I mean, I'm sorry, folks.
[00:01:02.707 --> 00:01:03.748]  I've studied this stuff.
[00:01:03.748 --> 00:01:06.309]  When people tried this in the past, the cops just killed them.
[00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:08.310]  I mean, the cops didn't used to be like this.
[00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.191]  I just can't believe it.
[00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:15.654]  Well, this is crazy because we've had four bomb threats this week on the same street.
[00:01:16.403 --> 00:01:21.867]  There was another bomb threat today, and they had to evacuate all these rescue vehicles because of another bomb threat.
[00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:28.072]  I mean, they pulled out the whole... There was every cop in three counties out here just the other day, right on this very street.
[00:01:28.072 --> 00:01:31.094]  Well, that shows... Listen, this has got black op written all over it.
[00:01:31.094 --> 00:01:31.554]  That's right.
[00:01:31.554 --> 00:01:33.435]  I remember hearing about the last shooting.
[00:01:33.435 --> 00:01:36.898]  You've got a shooting there in this little rural area, then another one.
[00:01:36.898 --> 00:01:38.019]  Weird bomb threats.
[00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:39.940]  Oh my God.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.342]  Somebody's got to get to the school surveillance camera tapes and data banks.
[00:01:43.342 --> 00:01:45.844]  I bet you're going to see a lot of suspicious people in there.
[00:01:45.844 --> 00:01:47.846]  Now they're saying they've killed the shooter now.
[00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:48.786]  Is that what they're saying?
[00:01:48.786 --> 00:01:49.407]  No.
[00:01:49.407 --> 00:01:54.290]  What I heard last was that he had killed himself and they've kind of dropped the two-shooter thing.
[00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.051]  I haven't heard anything else about that.
[00:01:56.051 --> 00:02:01.275]  And it looks, from the activities of the police, it looks like it's over.
[00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:03.977]  There was a big shift a few hours back.
[00:02:03.977 --> 00:02:05.978]  Let me ask you, what's your gut on this, Matt?
[00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:08.914]  You know, I don't know yet, Alex.
[00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:11.696]  I'm going to have to wait and hear how it all rolls out.
[00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:16.159]  All I can tell you is what I've heard so far, and I've never seen anything like this in this town.
[00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:29.507]  And I will say this, it's been a very strange week living where I'm living because, like I said just a couple of days ago, every cop in three counties, I mean all of the, they were all in their SWAT gear and everything.
[00:02:29.507 --> 00:02:33.509]  Somebody's been calling in bomb threats all week.
[00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.111]  And I don't know, it's kind of, isn't that kind of strange?
[00:02:37.077 --> 00:02:43.559]  Well, that could be the crazy person, or it could be somebody inside intelligence that didn't want this black op to go forward.
[00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:47.661]  Bottom line, maybe up to 35 people.
[00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:49.621]  35 now, dead.
[00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:51.542]  I just saw that during the break, they were saying over 30.
[00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:54.723]  This is absolutely disgusting.
[00:02:54.723 --> 00:02:57.664]  Look, immediately, it's time to rearm the pilots.
[00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.144]  It is time, because they were armed, they could be armed before 9-11, two months before they changed the law.
[00:03:03.144 --> 00:03:04.245]  Very suspicious.
[00:03:04.245 --> 00:03:10.751]  It's time that if a professor wants to have a gun, that there be a secured lockbox.
[00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:12.813]  They go take some certification course.
[00:03:12.813 --> 00:03:19.260]  There be a secured lockbox underneath their table or desk.
[00:03:20.152 --> 00:03:31.759]  And it's time to trust the citizenry again, and this piece of garbage might have been able to kill four or five people, but I guarantee you every other professor would want to go out and kill this son of a bitch.
[00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:35.801]  I'm sorry to talk like that, but people have been killed, and I'm tired of it.
[00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:36.722]  Stay there, Matt, because...
[00:03:37.402 --> 00:03:38.043]  Stay there, Matt.
[00:03:38.043 --> 00:03:43.486]  I want to get you on the other side, and I want to debrief you on everything you've seen as somebody that lives on campus.
[00:03:43.486 --> 00:03:44.367]  Okay, Matt?
[00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:45.107]  Sure, thank you.
[00:03:45.107 --> 00:03:45.888]  All right, stay there.
[00:03:45.888 --> 00:03:53.053]  We'll be right back with Matt, who joins us from Virginia on the campus, where there has been massive killing.

[00:05:18.872 --> 00:05:20.633]  Mainstream media.
[00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:22.394]  Government cover-ups.
[00:05:22.394 --> 00:05:23.974]  You want answers?
[00:05:23.974 --> 00:05:25.535]  Well, so does he.
[00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:29.717]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:05:29.717 --> 00:05:35.319]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.141]  Matt Kazee is a Genesis listener.
[00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:41.962]  He's also involved in the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:05:41.962 --> 00:05:43.922]  I was just talking to him during the break.
[00:05:43.922 --> 00:05:47.604]  And he's agreed to go on the record with his full name, Matt Kazee.
[00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:50.441]  K-A-Z-E-E.
[00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:53.324]  And he's gonna get the floor now with this Virginia shooting.
[00:05:53.324 --> 00:05:54.926]  They're now saying it could be as many as 34 dead.
[00:05:56.607 --> 00:05:59.549]  And we have some audio clips that are going to be coming up as well here.
[00:05:59.549 --> 00:06:00.690]  We'll continue to take your phone calls.
[00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.652]  I meant to get into the big 9-11 developments on Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:06:03.652 --> 00:06:05.233]  We've got to keep pushing and exposing that.
[00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:09.536]  Can't let this shooting become the total distraction, but it is important.
[00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:13.779]  And it's either a complete nut or it has a lot of telltale earmarks of a black op.
[00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:17.642]  Now, you're there living on campus a block away from where a lot of this happened.
[00:06:17.642 --> 00:06:19.563]  You're right in the middle of it.
[00:06:19.563 --> 00:06:23.906]  Start with what you heard, what you saw, what the first media reports were.
[00:06:23.906 --> 00:06:24.607]  Walk us through it.
[00:06:24.607 --> 00:06:25.107]  Take your time.
[00:06:25.862 --> 00:06:29.943]  Alright, this morning I woke up to a loudspeaker going off.
[00:06:29.943 --> 00:06:33.144]  I thought it was somebody driving by with a bullhorn, actually.
[00:06:33.144 --> 00:06:42.966]  But I found out that they had just installed these loudspeakers across campus because of the last school shooting that we had, which was the first day of the school year.
[00:06:42.966 --> 00:06:44.407]  Stop right there!
[00:06:44.407 --> 00:06:46.887]  Let's go back and detail that one.
[00:06:46.887 --> 00:06:48.448]  Okay, actually I knew this guy.
[00:06:48.448 --> 00:06:52.429]  He was a kid who went to high school around here.
[00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:53.429]  Everybody knew this kid.
[00:06:54.145 --> 00:06:58.386]  Um, his brother fought in, um, the Afghanistan war.
[00:06:58.386 --> 00:07:00.826]  Um, they got in a little bit of trouble.
[00:07:00.826 --> 00:07:08.027]  Uh, they, listen, his brother, uh, tried to rob an ATM machine and he was involved with some other type of robbery.
[00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:12.008]  He broke out of jail, killed, um, maybe three people.
[00:07:12.008 --> 00:07:13.948]  Two of them were cops.
[00:07:13.948 --> 00:07:21.630]  And, uh, the, the brother, um, like I said, because he was his brother and involved, apparently involved in this, they just gave him 35 years.
[00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:21.670]  Um,
[00:07:24.065 --> 00:07:28.686]  But the whole community has been shook up by this terrible tragedy that we just had.
[00:07:28.686 --> 00:07:38.588]  And today... So it all starts with an Afghan operator, an American troop who'd been in combat.
[00:07:38.588 --> 00:07:40.849]  He was... That was the brother of the shooter.
[00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:43.229]  I understand, but it's all tied into that.
[00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:44.469]  Just like with the tower.
[00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:46.430]  Please continue.
[00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.710]  Anyway, so they had installed these loudspeakers.
[00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.011]  That's what I heard this morning was...
[00:07:53.038 --> 00:07:56.119]  Basically an alert, a warning that there is a shooter on campus.
[00:07:56.119 --> 00:08:00.740]  Please stay indoors, stay off the streets, stay away from windows.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:15.303]  I heard that for maybe 20 minutes before it actually hit the news and when the news came on it was that there was a shooter on campus, that maybe two people or three people had been shot, but no confirmation of any of that.
[00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:21.203]  And as it developed, we were just flooded with ambulances and rescue.
[00:08:21.203 --> 00:08:24.945]  The whole SWAT team showing up right out and very close by here.
[00:08:24.945 --> 00:08:28.067]  And we went out and started talking to people on the street to find out what was going on.
[00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:35.532]  Well, this is also a victim disarmament zone because under federal law, none of the citizens can have guns that live on campus.
[00:08:35.532 --> 00:08:39.074]  So it's a perfect place for a black op because nobody's got guns.
[00:08:39.074 --> 00:08:40.755]  Please continue.
[00:08:40.755 --> 00:08:44.638]  Yes, and it was basically pretty well known
[00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:56.280]  Early on, the first word was that there were multiple shooters, and I think that had to do with how many people it was being reported that were killed.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:05.146]  He killed three people, or at least shot three people, killed at least one of those three, I think maybe all three, a few blocks away from here.
[00:09:05.146 --> 00:09:07.988]  I'm making a prediction, a guesstimation.
[00:09:07.988 --> 00:09:10.770]  I bet he's going to be an Iraq or Afghan vet.
[00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:15.069]  Yeah, well, we'll see if that comes true.
[00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:15.689]  You never know.
[00:09:15.689 --> 00:09:19.452]  Because if they're not going to be our cops... This was right on top of the ROTC, by the way.
[00:09:19.452 --> 00:09:21.013]  Oh, it happened by the ROTC?
[00:09:21.013 --> 00:09:26.777]  Oh, no, it's... Literally half a block away from the ROTC buildings and all the ROTC dorms.
[00:09:26.777 --> 00:09:28.318]  Yeah, it's the military.
[00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:37.304]  And watch, he's going to be disappeared for the last few months, and then we'll dig out that he was at a special installation being given psychiatric care.
[00:09:37.304 --> 00:09:39.826]  Because, you know, this happens over and over again.
[00:09:39.826 --> 00:09:40.226]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:09:40.226 --> 00:09:40.747]  Please continue.
[00:09:41.403 --> 00:09:42.044]  No, no, no.
[00:09:42.044 --> 00:09:48.650]  I'll tell you what I did hear about that was that it was a kid who was going to a specific classroom.
[00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.292]  Now this is not confirmed.
[00:09:50.292 --> 00:09:51.913]  This was one of the last things that I heard.
[00:09:51.913 --> 00:09:55.557]  It was a kid going to a specific classroom because of whatever.
[00:09:55.557 --> 00:09:59.281]  Some people were making fun of him or whatever.
[00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:01.623]  So they're now saying it's a trench coat mafia type deal?
[00:10:02.432 --> 00:10:09.598]  Uh, that's what, the media's not saying anything locally as far as whether they've actually got the guy or not.
[00:10:09.598 --> 00:10:15.362]  Stay there, stay there, tell us more on the other side, eyewitness.
[00:10:15.362 --> 00:10:22.208]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:29.854]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:30.535 --> 00:10:37.979]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:37.979 --> 00:10:49.725]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:10:49.725 --> 00:10:53.688]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:10:53.688 --> 00:10:55.949]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:59.791]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:11:13.508 --> 00:11:18.771]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[00:11:18.771 --> 00:11:28.876]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[00:11:28.876 --> 00:11:32.217]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.

[00:13:12.978 --> 00:13:18.402]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:13:18.402 --> 00:13:23.506]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:13:23.506 --> 00:13:27.349]  Alright, huge new 9-11 truth developments with Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:30.232]  I haven't even had a chance to get to yet because
[00:13:31.889 --> 00:13:35.670]  This mass shooting, it could be as many as 34 dead.
[00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.290]  The number continues to go up.
[00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.371]  I kept saying on air, folks, you're going to have some university or high school shooting.
[00:13:41.371 --> 00:13:43.771]  It could be as many as 100 dead.
[00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:48.612]  That's what I've been saying in the past, because these black ops are just bad news.
[00:13:48.612 --> 00:13:57.994]  Not to mention all the brainwashed drug addict youth that is just snorting methamphetamine and playing 15 hours of video games a day, where all they do is mass shoot people.
[00:13:57.994 --> 00:13:59.774]  Those were developed by the Pentagon.
[00:14:01.135 --> 00:14:07.638]  To instinctively block the inhibition towards splattering innocent people.
[00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:10.400]  And it's just instinctive firing.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:20.585]  Because in the past, going back 30, 40, 50 years, you had a few mass shooters, but they'd start shooting little kids or women and children in a McDonald's and they'd start throwing up, getting sick.
[00:14:20.585 --> 00:14:22.386]  Because you're built not to do that.
[00:14:22.386 --> 00:14:27.869]  You're built to feel good when somebody attacks you and they're big and bad and you strike back and they hit the ground.
[00:14:28.855 --> 00:14:30.276]  I mean, that's instinctive.
[00:14:30.276 --> 00:14:33.176]  I mean, you're designed, really, you have almost morals built into you.
[00:14:33.176 --> 00:14:38.798]  And then when you break that code, I guess, and then sin against, you know, your very nature, I don't know how to explain it.
[00:14:38.798 --> 00:14:44.160]  The point is, I'm getting off into just how people operate.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:50.202]  It's just absolutely amazing that they had victim disarmament, total gun ban on all the campuses in America.
[00:14:50.202 --> 00:14:57.704]  I had a friend one time who was, UT campus is just giant, and he was walking across just a corner of campus.
[00:14:58.903 --> 00:15:03.964]  And the cops saw that he had a fanny pack and he had a concealed carry.
[00:15:03.964 --> 00:15:05.445]  They walked over and said, what is that?
[00:15:05.445 --> 00:15:06.645]  He said, oh, that's my concealed carry.
[00:15:06.645 --> 00:15:09.346]  And they said, boom, up against the wall, put it up against the bus stop.
[00:15:09.346 --> 00:15:11.586]  And he was literally about 10 feet on the campus.
[00:15:11.586 --> 00:15:17.208]  They just wait, lurking to get our best and brightest and most upright citizens.
[00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:20.129]  By the way, all the gun grabbers, we're about to go back to our guest.
[00:15:20.129 --> 00:15:20.969]  I'm going to go back to Mark.
[00:15:22.771 --> 00:15:29.895]  Because he there who is on campus, ladies and gentlemen, literally just a block from where the shooting was going on.
[00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:32.277]  We're going to be talking to him in just a moment.
[00:15:33.596 --> 00:15:49.305]  I had another friend who had forgotten about the federal law and was walking across campus and going to a Patriot meeting and some cops showed up because he was giving people silver, $8 at the time, little silver pieces, $10 pieces that were really worth about $8.
[00:15:49.305 --> 00:15:53.307]  He was showing them to people, you know, liberty money and going, oh, look at this great.
[00:15:53.307 --> 00:15:58.490]  And the cops thought that was illegal and then came to arrest him for just, they thought it was counterfeit.
[00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.711]  They thought you're not allowed to have
[00:16:00.431 --> 00:16:02.912]  Silver struck, you know, other than the government.
[00:16:02.912 --> 00:16:13.755]  Remember the guy who went and bought like a $50 item at Best Buy with $2 bills, and the clerks thought it was illegal, the manager thought it was illegal.
[00:16:13.755 --> 00:16:17.255]  They were all so dumb that they thought that was counterfeit.
[00:16:17.255 --> 00:16:18.796]  You see, that's one reason they want to dumb us down.
[00:16:18.796 --> 00:16:21.857]  And a lot of the public, folks, is literally retarded now.
[00:16:21.857 --> 00:16:25.938]  They've been conditioned to do nothing but entertainment, so they never have any of their own thoughts.
[00:16:25.938 --> 00:16:27.158]  And they're totally dumb.
[00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.251]  And remember that case?
[00:16:29.251 --> 00:16:29.911]  He went to jail.
[00:16:29.911 --> 00:16:30.931]  They went ahead and arrested him.
[00:16:30.931 --> 00:16:33.192]  The cops thought it was fake, too.
[00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:34.593]  None of the cops that showed up.
[00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:36.774]  And then, of course, the higher-ups went, you idiots!
[00:16:36.774 --> 00:16:37.694]  Let him go!
[00:16:37.694 --> 00:16:38.594]  Two-dollar bills!
[00:16:38.594 --> 00:16:39.555]  What are you talking about?
[00:16:39.555 --> 00:16:43.136]  You know, they got him signing a Declaration of Independence on the back.
[00:16:43.136 --> 00:16:43.796]  They're really neat.
[00:16:43.796 --> 00:16:47.158]  I've got a couple of them.
[00:16:47.158 --> 00:16:52.820]  It's just unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen, that I've had to go speak at UT.
[00:16:54.675 --> 00:16:59.912]  while i was getting death threats and while really scary people are coming around i mean i mean you talk about uh...
[00:17:01.435 --> 00:17:17.284]  And I had a police officer bodyguard there and he couldn't even, well one of my listeners, now I never had bodyguards in the past, but there was a guy in a black trench coat going around, he went to another meeting I was at and was pulling his hand out and pointing it at me like it was a gun at the back of the, I mean, really scaring everybody.
[00:17:17.284 --> 00:17:19.725]  So I, and everybody's like, no, you gotta have a bodyguard, you gotta have a bodyguard.
[00:17:19.725 --> 00:17:21.486]  So I said, okay, I'll get one.
[00:17:21.486 --> 00:17:22.226]  Couldn't have a gun.
[00:17:22.226 --> 00:17:28.870]  I mean, even a cop couldn't have a gun on their off-duty on federal property, on God property, you know, state property under federal law.
[00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.932]  Uh, so, that's how it works, folks.
[00:17:32.932 --> 00:17:35.734]  And, uh, that's how America operates.
[00:17:35.734 --> 00:17:37.055]  Everybody's like, wear a bulletproof vest.
[00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:38.556]  I'm like, no, I'm not going to wear a bulletproof vest.
[00:17:38.556 --> 00:17:39.877]  I'm frankly not worried about it.
[00:17:39.877 --> 00:17:42.278]  I don't want to die, but I'm just, I'm not worried about it.
[00:17:42.278 --> 00:17:44.179]  I'm not going to live in fear.
[00:17:44.179 --> 00:17:47.561]  And, uh, you know, that's just the way it is.
[00:17:47.561 --> 00:17:49.843]  Uh, but, uh, the cop was wearing a bulletproof vest.
[00:17:49.843 --> 00:17:51.464]  He was just going to tackle.
[00:17:51.464 --> 00:17:54.946]  He actually had two cops there, but I'm already digressing and some other people.
[00:17:54.946 --> 00:17:59.189]  But, um, and that's a real cop, you know, ready to tackle somebody.
[00:18:00.489 --> 00:18:04.811]  But of course you have the UT police there, totally worthless.
[00:18:04.811 --> 00:18:07.212]  I mean literally folks, when there's a shooter, they run and hide.
[00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:08.372]  And that basically happened here.
[00:18:08.372 --> 00:18:09.413]  But I'm going to shut up.
[00:18:09.413 --> 00:18:13.194]  Let's play about a minute and a half clip of somebody on a cell phone with the gunshots going off.
[00:18:13.194 --> 00:18:14.995]  And we'll go back to our eyewitness guest.
[00:18:14.995 --> 00:18:15.275]  Here it is.
[00:18:23.067 --> 00:18:27.089]  Okay, Jamal Alberguti is, I believe, on the phone with us now.
[00:18:27.089 --> 00:18:31.011]  Jamal, pretty unbelievable pictures that you have there.
[00:18:31.011 --> 00:18:32.171]  I'm hoping.
[00:18:32.171 --> 00:18:36.173]  It was a little frightening watching because it seemed like you were pretty darn close.
[00:18:36.173 --> 00:18:38.655]  We first heard a series of shots.
[00:18:38.655 --> 00:18:40.675]  We see the officers.
[00:18:40.675 --> 00:18:49.119]  Can't tell if those shots are coming from their guns or from possibly the person inside the building or outside of the building.
[00:18:49.119 --> 00:18:52.161]  Tell us what you were able to see with your own naked eye.
[00:18:53.519 --> 00:19:01.444]  Well, the first thing I saw is when the policemen started taking their guns out, and then I knew that this was serious.
[00:19:01.444 --> 00:19:06.907]  I really didn't hear anything about the shooting that happened in A.J.
[00:19:06.907 --> 00:19:11.830]  But when I saw the guns, I knew that this isn't another bomb threat.
[00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:16.453]  Then I started hearing some gunshots far away.
[00:19:16.453 --> 00:19:21.376]  It seemed to me that they were not at Norris Hall, the building where the cops were just
[00:19:22.159 --> 00:19:23.661]  We're good to go.
[00:19:41.952 --> 00:19:52.880]  And there was a person in the building trying, on the second floor, at Norris, trying to tell the cops that he's in there, and probably trying to guide them in.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.342]  Now, Jamal, were you able to hear that person?
[00:19:55.342 --> 00:20:03.028]  And again, just to be clear for our viewers, this is apparently Norris Hall, the site of the second shooting that took place at Virginia Tech this morning.
[00:20:03.028 --> 00:20:09.353]  Jamal, you were able to hear some type of conversation between somebody on the second floor and the police officers outside?
[00:20:09.953 --> 00:20:13.498]  Well, I wasn't, but I saw his hand from the window.
[00:20:13.498 --> 00:20:18.785]  He was trying to reach outside the window to talk to the cops.
[00:20:18.785 --> 00:20:20.967]  So, this is what I saw.
[00:20:20.967 --> 00:20:26.955]  I didn't actually hear him talking to them, but he was... Well, he was talking to them.
[00:20:26.955 --> 00:20:28.537]  I did not hear what he said.
[00:20:29.324 --> 00:20:31.365]  I was a little bit far away from there.
[00:20:31.365 --> 00:20:42.131]  Alright, now after we see the pictures here that you were able to capture with your cell phone, we see that you actually moved quite a bit closer as the police went on down, I assume inside the building.
[00:20:42.131 --> 00:20:45.713]  What happened after all of that?
[00:20:45.713 --> 00:20:52.636]  Well, I wasn't able to see anything because a cop came from behind me and he asked me to leave the area.
[00:20:52.636 --> 00:20:54.757]  I imagine so, for your safety, obviously.
[00:20:56.781 --> 00:20:59.343]  Going to our eyewitness who lives on campus.
[00:20:59.343 --> 00:21:00.884]  He is a 9-11 truther.
[00:21:00.884 --> 00:21:04.186]  He reminded me that he has called in to the show before.
[00:21:04.186 --> 00:21:09.830]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, this is happening at the Virginia Tech College.
[00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:17.295]  They're in the West Ambler Johnston Hall.
[00:21:17.295 --> 00:21:19.557]  This is absolutely horrible.
[00:21:19.557 --> 00:21:20.838]  They're saying it could be well over
[00:21:22.085 --> 00:21:22.785]  34 people dead now.
[00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:25.228]  The number is just climbing.
[00:21:25.228 --> 00:21:32.495]  Now, going back to our guest, Matt Kazee.
[00:21:32.495 --> 00:21:33.996]  Matt, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:21:33.996 --> 00:21:35.998]  Please continue, and again, go back to the start.
[00:21:35.998 --> 00:21:42.004]  Go through all the facets, what you heard, the other bomb threats, and then detail what happened today.
[00:21:42.004 --> 00:21:42.605]  You've got the floor.
[00:21:43.306 --> 00:21:49.268]  I would have to say that the whole town has been on a little bit of tension because for the past week we've had multiple bomb threats.
[00:21:49.268 --> 00:21:50.348]  This happened a week ago.
[00:21:50.348 --> 00:21:56.009]  We had cleared out campus right over here where this, where the second shooting was.
[00:21:56.009 --> 00:22:07.232]  Then they had at the end of the week, I guess this was probably, it was probably Friday, I'm not sure, but at the end of the week they had another, they had three multiple bomb threats in one day.
[00:22:08.044 --> 00:22:11.927]  And they brought in every vehicle that they could.
[00:22:11.927 --> 00:22:13.468]  They had the whole place covered.
[00:22:13.468 --> 00:22:21.014]  So in some ways, SWAT has been over and has covered this little area where all of this happened for the past week.
[00:22:21.014 --> 00:22:26.158]  And they stayed until about 9.30, 10 o'clock that night, and nothing ever came from it.
[00:22:26.158 --> 00:22:29.640]  The campus put out a $5,000 reward for any information.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.021]  Hadn't heard anything.
[00:22:31.021 --> 00:22:34.284]  Today, we all know what happened.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.460]  It hit the fan, that's for sure.
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:45.642]  I just heard that report on the phone there, and it sounded like they were saying that he was trying to holler to the police from the window or something like that.
[00:22:45.642 --> 00:22:51.063]  Well, basically, the individual was going around taking his time, killing all the people that were told, stay indoors.
[00:22:51.063 --> 00:22:52.803]  They do the exact opposite.
[00:22:52.803 --> 00:22:56.724]  And so it looks like that there were people jumping out and other things.
[00:22:56.724 --> 00:23:01.045]  People saying, hey, he's in here, help us, while he's going around killing people.
[00:23:02.407 --> 00:23:08.991]  Who knows by then what really happened, and we'll probably never know, you know, for a year or so, then we found out what happened at Columbine.
[00:23:08.991 --> 00:23:12.553]  I mean, do you really believe Harrison Clybull were able to get over 100?
[00:23:12.553 --> 00:23:22.760]  It was 124 bombs, some of them, you know, huge 60-something gallon tanks of propane that two people could hardly carry.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:23.400]  Yeah.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:58.042]  I mean, what do you think about that, my friend?
[00:23:58.042 --> 00:24:01.444]  Yeah, that's impossible that they could get all those bombs in there that day.
[00:24:01.444 --> 00:24:01.904]  We know that.
[00:24:01.904 --> 00:24:06.546]  We also know how many kids got killed by men in black that day.
[00:24:06.546 --> 00:24:08.707]  I don't know if there were any shots fired.
[00:24:08.707 --> 00:24:11.449]  By the way, I know Paul Watson's doing an article on this.
[00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:12.409]  Paul, type in it.
[00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:13.550]  CBS News is the one.
[00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.011]  I pulled it up when I was at a friend's house a few months ago.
[00:24:16.011 --> 00:24:18.012]  I was telling him about it and he didn't believe it, so I pulled it up.
[00:24:18.012 --> 00:24:18.552]  It's something like,
[00:24:19.652 --> 00:24:22.074]  Hundreds of bombs at Columbine.
[00:24:22.074 --> 00:24:25.116]  And then it's 124 or 126 CBS News headlines.
[00:24:25.116 --> 00:24:27.518]  I think it's 124, memory serves.
[00:24:27.518 --> 00:24:29.099]  Go ahead, sorry.
[00:24:29.099 --> 00:24:33.822]  Well, I'm wondering now if we're going to find something like that with this because of the whole bomb threat.
[00:24:33.822 --> 00:24:35.042]  It's a giant.
[00:24:35.042 --> 00:24:38.745]  Bottom line, it's either a giant provocateur op or it's a pure government op.
[00:24:39.568 --> 00:24:40.549]  Or it's a mental patient.
[00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:53.658]  But you know, before I even knew about this, last hour, when I just had seen the article that was a mass shooting, I said, if we hear there's multiple shooters, if there's a whole bunch of people shot, if there's any kind of drills involved, or anything before, it's a black op.
[00:24:53.658 --> 00:24:56.380]  And this thing has black op.
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.060]  Oh my God.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.041]  Oh my God.
[00:24:58.041 --> 00:24:59.962]  All of the above, sounds like to me.
[00:24:59.962 --> 00:25:00.583]  Oh my God.
[00:25:00.583 --> 00:25:02.104]  Well, I hope it's not a black op.
[00:25:02.104 --> 00:25:04.345]  It's a lot more scary if it's the government.
[00:25:04.345 --> 00:25:07.588]  But, I mean, we know the DC sniper, that was total black op.
[00:25:07.588 --> 00:25:07.968]  The Jewish
[00:25:09.566 --> 00:25:13.568]  School thing, it was black op, with furrow, we'll be right back with you.
[00:25:13.568 --> 00:25:18.370]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:22.992]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[00:25:22.992 --> 00:25:36.999]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey Light Water Purifier, an LED Base, two Berkey Sport Filtration Bottles, the Berkey Battery Adapter, the Berkey MP Solar Charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:25:37.239 --> 00:25:54.169]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones.
[00:25:54.209 --> 00:25:54.549]  I think so.
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:17.261]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:26:17.261 --> 00:26:21.062]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[00:27:13.931 --> 00:27:15.795]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:27:15.795 --> 00:27:17.278]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:27:17.278 --> 00:27:20.484]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:27:20.484 --> 00:27:23.209]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?

[00:29:08.276 --> 00:29:11.078]  Box 281, Wildwood, PA 15091.
[00:29:11.078 --> 00:29:22.909]  We don't need no education We don't need no thought control
[00:29:33.425 --> 00:29:40.112]  Alright, we got Larry Pratt popping in to break down victim disarmament and what should have been done at this school.
[00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:49.021]  I'm gonna tell you right now, my children are not going to any of these colleges until they change the gun laws where at least the faculty can be armed.
[00:29:49.021 --> 00:29:49.501]  Period.
[00:29:49.501 --> 00:29:51.083]  And they're not going to any public school either.
[00:29:51.992 --> 00:30:04.743]  So somebody can just go, I mean the schools lock it down, so your children scrabble like gerbils up against a cage wall, the windows are all barred, they got fences around them, and they've already had cases where people are like, let me out!
[00:30:04.743 --> 00:30:08.026]  And they just walk up and dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[00:30:08.026 --> 00:30:10.168]  You know, the Terminator.
[00:30:10.168 --> 00:30:12.630]  I mean this is just absolutely incredible.
[00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:20.136]  By the way, I mean it's not, you just hide, you run and you hide, you wait till the person comes around the corner and you at least go after them.
[00:30:20.714 --> 00:30:25.876]  You know, they've had a lot of school shooting cases where the principal has to run out to their car, get the gun out of the car.
[00:30:25.876 --> 00:30:32.319]  Remember, in one case, the principal got fired, went in and took him out.
[00:30:32.319 --> 00:30:36.100]  In another case, went in and just ran the shooter off.
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.681]  And he didn't get in trouble.
[00:30:37.681 --> 00:30:44.563]  I mean, thank God the principal went in and got their gun and took this person out.
[00:30:44.563 --> 00:30:46.164]  Look, it's fine for the police to have guns.
[00:30:46.164 --> 00:30:47.745]  What about us?
[00:30:47.745 --> 00:30:48.685]  We're the good people.
[00:30:52.614 --> 00:31:01.624]  We need to be protected from the postman, and the crazy cops, and the criminals, and everybody going postal.
[00:31:01.624 --> 00:31:04.648]  I mean, every office needs an instant access pistol safe.
[00:31:04.648 --> 00:31:07.251]  A couple of them with trusted employees.
[00:31:07.251 --> 00:31:11.876]  And, uh, you know, if somebody ever busts in here, I mean, folks, I mean, let me tell you this fast.
[00:31:15.666 --> 00:31:17.987]  And I got a 7-shot .357 Magnum.
[00:31:17.987 --> 00:31:19.988]  I go with a revolver because it's simple.
[00:31:19.988 --> 00:31:21.149]  It's not going to jam.
[00:31:21.149 --> 00:31:23.510]  And when I've got adrenaline going through me, it's going to get the job done.
[00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:27.352]  Let me take the rounds out of it.
[00:31:27.352 --> 00:31:29.353]  And again, folks, I never talk about guns a lot on the air.
[00:31:29.353 --> 00:31:30.514]  I'm just for the Second Amendment.
[00:31:30.514 --> 00:31:32.395]  I've got quite a few.
[00:31:32.395 --> 00:31:34.616]  And I know how to use them.
[00:31:34.616 --> 00:31:36.977]  And you just need to be ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:36.977 --> 00:31:41.039]  See, I'm spinning the cylinder.
[00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:42.960]  You need to be ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:44.036 --> 00:31:46.657]  And I'm so busy I never get to go to the range but three or four times a year.
[00:31:46.657 --> 00:31:48.958]  Everybody needs to do it more than that.
[00:31:48.958 --> 00:31:51.459]  And you need to protect yourself.
[00:31:51.459 --> 00:31:54.401]  I got a .357 Magnum Smith & Wesson.
[00:31:54.401 --> 00:31:58.422]  I bought this after they quit being gun banners.
[00:31:58.422 --> 00:32:10.488]  And again, I know how to use the fanciest of guns, but for something for quick defense, this is something I can, at 50 yards, I can shoot somebody in the chest with this.
[00:32:11.238 --> 00:32:17.921]  At 50 yards, I can shoot about a 4 or 5 inch pattern with this handgun.
[00:32:17.921 --> 00:32:18.782]  That's when I'm calm.
[00:32:18.782 --> 00:32:28.086]  But people will tell you in the office or other places you need a shotgun, but that's something again that's too big, too hard to store.
[00:32:28.086 --> 00:32:33.849]  And the point is, somebody comes around here wanting trouble, I'm not going down without a fight.
[00:32:33.849 --> 00:32:34.809]  Okay?
[00:32:34.809 --> 00:32:40.832]  And I'm not going to live in a filth-bagged state or city where they tell me I can't have this protection I've got in my hand right now.
[00:32:43.829 --> 00:32:49.652]  But again, in those dormitories with your sons and daughters, they're not able to have an incident access pistol safe.
[00:32:49.652 --> 00:32:52.173]  They're not able to protect themselves.
[00:32:52.173 --> 00:33:01.117]  They've got to sit there while some piece of trash, mental patient, drug addict, or government operative, or some mind control victim, and we know that goes on.
[00:33:01.117 --> 00:33:03.478]  They've got to sit there while they have their way with them.
[00:33:03.478 --> 00:33:06.079]  Going back to our guest, Matt Kazee.
[00:33:06.079 --> 00:33:08.219]  Matt, again, you live there on campus.
[00:33:08.219 --> 00:33:09.280]  What area of campus do you live on?
[00:33:10.182 --> 00:33:11.805]  I'm pretty much right in the heart of campus.
[00:33:11.805 --> 00:33:17.957]  I'm about less than a block away from the ROTC dorms and in the armory, which is
[00:33:18.447 --> 00:33:21.249]  Pretty much less than a block away from this second shooter.
[00:33:21.249 --> 00:33:25.491]  And again, the armory can have weapons, the troops can have weapons, but you, the evil citizen, can't.
[00:33:25.491 --> 00:33:29.673]  Because I know under federal law, any university, you can't have guns.
[00:33:29.673 --> 00:33:35.977]  I guess you've got to live there where you can't have guns while there's multiple shooters running around foaming at the mouth on a routine basis?
[00:33:35.977 --> 00:33:37.138]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:33:37.138 --> 00:33:37.718]  That's crazy.
[00:33:37.718 --> 00:33:41.080]  Have they announced anything that they have caught him or that he killed himself on the news yet?
[00:33:41.955 --> 00:33:43.456]  Uh, yeah, I think that Bob was just out there.
[00:33:43.456 --> 00:33:45.558]  I think they're saying they killed himself, but they're not sure.
[00:33:45.558 --> 00:33:48.240]  They're could, you know, stay in your homes.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:53.545]  Okay, I just ran up there just while, in between break, and you can tell that it's over.
[00:33:53.545 --> 00:33:55.627]  I mean, it's just a completely different tone.
[00:33:55.627 --> 00:33:57.668]  All the vehicles are still there, but it's over.
[00:33:57.668 --> 00:34:05.835]  You know that they had to, they had so many people dead, they had to bring in the local Blacksburg Transit buses to carry them out.
[00:34:05.835 --> 00:34:07.877]  They didn't have enough ambulances.
[00:34:09.275 --> 00:34:13.237]  And I sent you guys a bunch of pictures, actually, that's getting sent right now.
[00:34:13.237 --> 00:34:14.838]  And there are a couple of pictures of that.
[00:34:14.838 --> 00:34:18.519]  And when I get off the phone, I'm going to go back out there and try and photograph it.
[00:34:18.519 --> 00:34:23.822]  And I will find out the story on this guy from local students.
[00:34:23.822 --> 00:34:28.124]  I'm pretty sure he is a student, is what I've heard so far.
[00:34:28.124 --> 00:34:29.964]  Do you have a cell phone?
[00:34:29.964 --> 00:34:31.945]  Can you go out on the ground for us out there?
[00:34:31.945 --> 00:34:33.046]  Oh yeah, I sure can.
[00:34:33.046 --> 00:34:37.448]  Tell you what, during the break, give him the hotline, John.
[00:34:39.861 --> 00:34:41.582]  John Harmon, will you give him the hotline?
[00:34:41.582 --> 00:34:43.363]  John's the best doing five jobs.
[00:34:43.363 --> 00:34:44.104]  Give him the hotline.
[00:34:44.104 --> 00:34:44.864]  Have him call right now.
[00:34:44.864 --> 00:34:45.905]  Let's get him on the horn.
[00:34:45.905 --> 00:34:46.465]  Let's come back.
[00:34:46.465 --> 00:34:47.546]  Talk to our eyewitness.
[00:34:47.546 --> 00:34:48.627]  Then we'll jam some calls in.
[00:34:48.627 --> 00:34:50.007]  Try to get into the rosy news.
[00:34:50.007 --> 00:34:52.129]  Big 9-11 news at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:56.211]  We cannot let what's happening overshadow that important news.
[00:34:56.211 --> 00:34:56.852]  We'll be right back.
[00:34:56.852 --> 00:35:03.516]  Stay with us.
[00:35:03.516 --> 00:35:04.897]  We're on the march.
[00:35:04.897 --> 00:35:06.398]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:13.333]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:13.333 --> 00:35:20.477]  Craig Walcott, chartered financial consultant and host of the Dead Doctors Don't Lie radio program, a million-dollar earner in the network marketing field since 1989.
[00:35:20.477 --> 00:35:22.839]  I certainly know what it takes to succeed.
[00:35:22.839 --> 00:35:28.482]  I also know without proper tools, your chance for significant income in the network marketing field can quickly fade.
[00:35:28.482 --> 00:35:34.405]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing will never spend the time nor money to develop the skills they need.
[00:35:34.665 --> 00:35:37.286]  That's where MLM Incorporated steps in.

[00:37:21.118 --> 00:37:27.982]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[00:37:27.982 --> 00:37:38.369]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[00:37:38.369 --> 00:37:41.831]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.

[00:38:19.626 --> 00:38:22.189]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[00:38:22.189 --> 00:38:24.611]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[00:38:24.611 --> 00:38:27.653]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[00:38:27.653 --> 00:38:31.236]  And everybody knew you didn't give no lift to Big John.
[00:38:33.012 --> 00:38:35.773]  Big John!
[00:38:35.773 --> 00:38:38.614]  Big John!
[00:38:38.614 --> 00:38:41.495]  Big Bad John!
[00:38:41.495 --> 00:38:44.696]  Big John!
[00:38:44.696 --> 00:38:47.357]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home.
[00:38:47.357 --> 00:38:50.058]  He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[00:38:50.058 --> 00:38:54.499]  Didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy, but he didn't spoke at all.
[00:38:54.499 --> 00:38:56.300]  He just said hi to Big John.
[00:38:58.579 --> 00:39:09.669]  Somebody said he came from New Orleans where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen and a crashing blow from a huge right hand sent a Louisiana fella to the promised land.
[00:39:09.669 --> 00:39:12.131]  Big John!
[00:39:12.131 --> 00:39:14.933]  Big John!
[00:39:14.933 --> 00:39:17.735]  Big John!
[00:39:17.735 --> 00:39:20.598]  Big Bad John!
[00:39:20.598 --> 00:39:21.599]  Big John!
[00:39:28.805 --> 00:39:31.765]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:31.765 --> 00:39:36.187]  John, Richard, Chris, Paul, everybody's been holding it forever.
[00:39:36.187 --> 00:39:39.008]  And I meant to get to the Rosie O'Donnell news.
[00:39:39.008 --> 00:39:39.988]  Big developments there.
[00:39:39.988 --> 00:39:40.848]  Never really got to.
[00:39:40.848 --> 00:39:42.369]  You can read it at Prison Planet.
[00:39:42.369 --> 00:39:46.370]  Because of the shooting, we're working on getting a report out asking, is this a black op?
[00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:47.050]  Like the others.
[00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:50.451]  I mean, if the government's done black ops before, then we know they have.
[00:39:51.051 --> 00:39:54.593]  We got him dead to rights on the Beltway Sniper.
[00:39:54.593 --> 00:40:00.635]  We got him dead to rights on the Buford Furrow in the Jewish School.
[00:40:00.635 --> 00:40:03.917]  We got him dead to rights on Columbine.
[00:40:03.917 --> 00:40:08.379]  I mean, it's just John Lennon, Ronald Reagan.
[00:40:08.379 --> 00:40:11.340]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.921]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:40:12.921 --> 00:40:15.562]  McVeigh, definite mind control there.
[00:40:16.946 --> 00:40:21.450]  I mean, his doctor, appointed by the government, was the father of modern mind control.
[00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:26.675]  Jolly and Wes, who just died a few years ago, and was there from the time he got arrested to the time he was executed.
[00:40:26.675 --> 00:40:31.980]  The top head mind control doctor, 1977 MKUltra hearings.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.842]  I mean, just unbelievable!
[00:40:37.149 --> 00:40:43.073]  It's just, they think we're so stupid, or the public doesn't know there's such a thing as mind control.
[00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:51.698]  Let me tell you, the stuff you saw in Manchurian Candidate, the new one that came out, is exactly, exactly how things bounce.
[00:40:51.698 --> 00:40:54.860]  That's how the ball bounces.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.682]  And that's exactly what they can do.
[00:40:58.682 --> 00:41:00.563]  That is so accurate, it is chilling.
[00:41:01.303 --> 00:41:05.306]  But they don't get you in facilities and hop you up on drugs for a week and torture you.
[00:41:05.306 --> 00:41:07.248]  They do it for months or years.
[00:41:07.248 --> 00:41:12.232]  And it works real well.
[00:41:12.232 --> 00:41:15.494]  Oh, man.
[00:41:15.494 --> 00:41:18.176]  Unbelievable.
[00:41:18.176 --> 00:41:20.098]  I mean, this didn't happen in the past in America.
[00:41:20.098 --> 00:41:21.939]  And you do have some nuts that go kill people.
[00:41:21.939 --> 00:41:23.741]  And you've got people that go to their work and kill people.
[00:41:23.741 --> 00:41:26.003]  But you've got postal stuff.
[00:41:26.003 --> 00:41:26.743]  Most of that's real.
[00:41:26.743 --> 00:41:28.765]  They go shoot their boss and co-workers.
[00:41:30.638 --> 00:41:36.881]  But this business of going around shooting 50-something people, killing 30-something of them, that's not normal.
[00:41:36.881 --> 00:41:43.965]  And by normal, I mean even in the sick world of mass shootings, that's not what you see in the criminology.
[00:41:43.965 --> 00:41:53.711]  Now, he lives on campus, and he's Matt Kazee, a listener of this show, there in Blacksburg, Virginia.
[00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:54.611]  It is Monday, April 16th, 2012.
[00:41:56.417 --> 00:42:02.099]  We're going to be talking about 9-11 and tax time and a bunch of war news, but we're talking about a mass shooting.
[00:42:02.099 --> 00:42:05.020]  Now the real test is, you know they already had a bunch of gun bills prepared.
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:10.722]  They've just been introducing last week and will be introducing this next week.
[00:42:10.722 --> 00:42:18.504]  And when they get back in session in the next few weeks, excuse me, they've been preparing bills and doing press conferences about bills in the last month, to be more exact.
[00:42:18.504 --> 00:42:24.146]  And now you're going to see them all introduced in the endless drum beating so that next time there's a mass shooting,
[00:42:24.901 --> 00:42:27.942]  We'll all be totally disarmed, and whoever's got the gun can kill 200, 300.
[00:42:27.942 --> 00:42:39.425]  And, uh... During breaks, I have been watching CNN and Fox, flipping back and forth, and it's exactly what I thought it was.
[00:42:39.425 --> 00:42:48.048]  It's video and photos of cops, hours into the shooting, while shooting's still going on, standing behind the doors of their patrol cars, cowering.
[00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:57.681]  When they knew the basic building, they should have immediately had police charged from all four sides in heavy body armor.
[00:42:57.681 --> 00:43:00.061]  They should have had SWAT teams lowered onto the roof.
[00:43:00.061 --> 00:43:01.422]  And they got SWAT teams all over the place.
[00:43:01.422 --> 00:43:02.482]  They all got helicopters.
[00:43:02.482 --> 00:43:05.322]  But these guys got to sit around and plan for hours.
[00:43:05.322 --> 00:43:07.963]  I mean, if you want to do some planning, they've all got armored vehicles.
[00:43:07.963 --> 00:43:13.904]  They should have rammed an armored vehicle right through the front door and gone right in there and killed this person.
[00:43:13.904 --> 00:43:17.465]  But no, they had to wait hours while he walked around shooting everybody.
[00:43:18.806 --> 00:43:22.247]  Four hours and fifteen minutes at Columbine they shot there.
[00:43:22.247 --> 00:43:25.128]  I'm tired of it!
[00:43:25.128 --> 00:43:25.548]  I know this.
[00:43:25.548 --> 00:43:33.490]  If there's ever a mass shooting around here, I mean, back, I mean, back when it happened at the Tower, the citizens just pulled their rifles out and kept him pinned down and stopped him from killing.
[00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:41.552]  He killed most of the people in the first ten minutes and then folks started shooting back and then he only killed one or two more and wounded a couple because people, the police and the citizens were shooting at him.
[00:43:41.552 --> 00:43:42.772]  Hundreds of people were shooting at him.
[00:43:45.237 --> 00:43:52.121]  Mike Hanson's daddy drove the ambulance right up there and was loading police that had been shot and citizens in.
[00:43:52.121 --> 00:44:00.405]  Literally, it was in the newspaper with flecks of concrete cutting him, hitting him in the face with bullets from that Marine shooting at him.
[00:44:00.405 --> 00:44:08.269]  For those who don't know Mike, he's done work for me for years, runs the TV show, but his daddy, what was his dad's name?
[00:44:08.269 --> 00:44:09.890]  Everybody knows him around town, all the old timers.
[00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:12.591]  It was a German name.
[00:44:14.369 --> 00:44:16.730]  I can't believe I can't remember his name.
[00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:17.430]  Otto Hanson.
[00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:20.852]  There you go.
[00:44:20.852 --> 00:44:21.992]  Ah, it doesn't matter.
[00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:23.413]  Otto liked to drive race cars.
[00:44:23.413 --> 00:44:27.495]  He had, you know, they did the drag racing back when the cops wouldn't come after you for that.
[00:44:27.495 --> 00:44:30.276]  And that was back when ambulances drove fast, too.
[00:44:30.276 --> 00:44:32.557]  He liked the ambulances because you had to drive fast.
[00:44:32.557 --> 00:44:33.117]  Otto Hanson.
[00:44:33.117 --> 00:44:37.499]  That's what made America great was the people that were daredevils and liked risk.
[00:44:37.499 --> 00:44:39.920]  Not a bunch of cowards following procedure.
[00:44:41.129 --> 00:44:47.311]  But I guarantee you, folks, if there was some mass shooting and I tried to go down there and go in or go help the police, they'd gun me down and say I was a shooter.
[00:44:47.311 --> 00:44:53.133]  That's how America's changed, ladies and gentlemen, and it's been done by design, so the people and the government are at each other's throats.
[00:44:53.133 --> 00:44:54.093]  I'm going to shut up.
[00:44:54.093 --> 00:44:56.414]  Matt Kazee is on the ground.
[00:44:56.414 --> 00:45:00.996]  He's gone down to the area with the police near the shooting where they've got it cordoned off.
[00:45:00.996 --> 00:45:04.037]  Matt, you're there in Blacksburg, Virginia, at the campus.
[00:45:04.037 --> 00:45:05.457]  Tell us what's happening.
[00:45:05.457 --> 00:45:07.618]  Yes, I'm standing in the middle of about 200 police cars.
[00:45:09.036 --> 00:45:17.238]  I'm right in front of the building where this happened, and you can tell it's all over, folks.
[00:45:17.238 --> 00:45:18.299]  They've got it under control.
[00:45:18.299 --> 00:45:24.561]  There's still some folks in the SWAT uniforms, a lot of sheriffs and a lot of state police, and not a kid to be seen.
[00:45:24.561 --> 00:45:31.603]  A few folks down here videotaping, some folks wandering around the drill field, but that's about it.
[00:45:31.603 --> 00:45:32.303]  It is pretty much
[00:45:34.616 --> 00:45:38.998]  That school is a giant black op, and it's at a 50% chance or higher.
[00:45:38.998 --> 00:45:41.199]  Everybody's got to get their children out of there now.
[00:45:41.199 --> 00:45:43.060]  Go ahead.
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:56.148]  Well, it looks like they still may be treating some people over at the local rescue squad, which just happened to be a half a block away.
[00:45:56.148 --> 00:45:58.809]  But as far as I can tell, they're allowing people.
[00:45:58.809 --> 00:46:01.390]  I'm going to try and get up as close as I can here.
[00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:02.351]  What is a half block away?
[00:46:03.417 --> 00:46:05.381]  Uh, the rescue squad.
[00:46:05.381 --> 00:46:10.188]  No, they just hollered at me and said, get out of here.
[00:46:10.188 --> 00:46:10.749]  Well, you know what?
[00:46:10.749 --> 00:46:11.731]  You're a reporter.
[00:46:11.731 --> 00:46:14.896]  Tell them you're a reporter with GCN Radio.
[00:46:14.896 --> 00:46:16.018]  It's far enough away.
[00:46:16.018 --> 00:46:16.819]  They're leaving me alone.
[00:46:16.819 --> 00:46:17.861]  I'm close enough.
[00:46:18.334 --> 00:46:21.055]  I was a little bit, getting a little bit too close there.
[00:46:21.055 --> 00:46:23.415]  Can you go over by the triage center?
[00:46:23.415 --> 00:46:26.396]  Now, now, now, are they bivouacked in an area?
[00:46:26.396 --> 00:46:27.916]  Uh, bringing in the dead and wounded?
[00:46:27.916 --> 00:46:31.397]  Or, or, or, uh, you say, uh, the rescues?
[00:46:31.397 --> 00:46:32.598]  They've gotten most of them out of there.
[00:46:32.598 --> 00:46:37.359]  We, I've got, uh, some pictures of them bringing some dead in where they were covering them, covering them up with sheets.
[00:46:37.979 --> 00:46:41.042]  Uh, they loaded a bunch of people up on a bus, a city transit bus.
[00:46:41.042 --> 00:46:41.803]  You got pictures.
[00:46:41.803 --> 00:46:43.185]  Can you email those to Aaron?
[00:46:43.185 --> 00:46:43.605]  I did.
[00:46:43.605 --> 00:46:45.367]  I did email some of the pictures that I have.
[00:46:45.367 --> 00:46:51.153]  I believe that some of those are included, and anything that I don't, as soon as I get done with this, I will email you guys.
[00:46:51.153 --> 00:46:52.554]  What address did you email them to?
[00:46:53.602 --> 00:46:55.623]  Aaron and, uh, Kevin.
[00:46:55.623 --> 00:46:56.604]  That's fine.
[00:46:56.604 --> 00:46:57.844]  Aaron's the place to send it.
[00:46:57.844 --> 00:47:00.025]  Aaroninfowars.com.
[00:47:00.025 --> 00:47:02.146]  Uh, Kevin doesn't work here anymore.
[00:47:02.146 --> 00:47:07.949]  So, that is, that is very, very important and I really do appreciate, uh, what you're doing, my friend.
[00:47:07.949 --> 00:47:09.870]  You're just doing a fabulous job.
[00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:10.851]  No problem at all.
[00:47:10.851 --> 00:47:13.292]  I can't believe this happened in my backyard.
[00:47:13.292 --> 00:47:19.875]  Well, it's, it's, uh, now, uh, again, it's kind of a rectangle-shaped building.
[00:47:19.875 --> 00:47:21.616]  Where are you right now?
[00:47:21.616 --> 00:47:22.917]  I'm directly in front of it.
[00:47:23.963 --> 00:47:25.423]  Okay, what do you see window-wise?
[00:47:25.423 --> 00:47:27.064]  Do you see any bullet damage?
[00:47:27.064 --> 00:47:29.024]  How many windows are shot out?
[00:47:29.024 --> 00:47:31.844]  Doesn't look like any.
[00:47:31.844 --> 00:47:39.646]  I can see some open windows, but as far as... Oh, I do see something that looks like it's been shot out, or at least holes in it.
[00:47:39.646 --> 00:47:41.226]  Sorry, it's pretty windy out here, Alex.
[00:47:41.226 --> 00:47:43.066]  Okay, are you able to get a photo of that?
[00:47:43.066 --> 00:47:44.127]  Are you using a digital camera?
[00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:44.747]  No, I don't.
[00:47:44.747 --> 00:47:48.187]  I do not have my camera on me, but I'm going to... I'm charging my video camera right now.
[00:47:48.187 --> 00:47:49.407]  I'm coming back down here.
[00:47:49.407 --> 00:47:51.508]  Oh, I'm getting... I can't go that way either.
[00:47:53.138 --> 00:48:00.385]  I've got some friends down here who are videotaping too and I'm going to get a copy of that and post all that stuff on my website and I'll be sure and send you guys a link.
[00:48:00.385 --> 00:48:02.828]  Yeah, tell us your website.
[00:48:02.828 --> 00:48:06.992]  TheTruthMovement.net Oh, I know your site well!
[00:48:06.992 --> 00:48:08.293]  Yeah, right on.
[00:48:08.293 --> 00:48:09.234]  We've talked before.
[00:48:09.234 --> 00:48:10.856]  Wow, what a small world.
[00:48:10.856 --> 00:48:12.678]  I know, it's crazy how it all works, isn't it?
[00:48:14.085 --> 00:48:15.667]  Uh, yes, I'm directly in front of the chapel.
[00:48:15.667 --> 00:48:18.269]  I'm standing here in front of a sheriff who's looking at me.
[00:48:18.269 --> 00:48:20.411]  He's got his, it looks like an assault rifle.
[00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:22.372]  He is eyeballing me big time.
[00:48:22.372 --> 00:48:24.354]  Well, tell him you're a radio reporter.
[00:48:24.354 --> 00:48:27.176]  I'm far enough away to where I don't, I don't want to talk to him anyway.
[00:48:27.176 --> 00:48:29.899]  Uh, but, uh, I'm still close enough.
[00:48:29.899 --> 00:48:32.001]  I'm way closer than the local media.
[00:48:32.001 --> 00:48:33.482]  They're, they're way back there.
[00:48:33.482 --> 00:48:35.724]  Well, yeah, they've been trained how to cower and follow orders.
[00:48:37.228 --> 00:48:40.611]  Listen, listen, you need to get back immediately to your friends.
[00:48:40.611 --> 00:48:48.958]  You need as a group together to go down there and you say, we are with GCN Radio Network and just say it confidently.
[00:48:48.958 --> 00:48:51.420]  They give you orders, follow them, but just be confident.
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.081]  Smile at them.
[00:48:53.081 --> 00:48:57.545]  And not in a smart way, but just a nice little smile.
[00:48:57.545 --> 00:48:58.426]  That's how to handle it.
[00:48:58.426 --> 00:48:58.706]  Go get
[00:49:00.047 --> 00:49:01.488]  And I really appreciate you, man.
[00:49:01.488 --> 00:49:02.369]  We got Larry Pratt coming up.
[00:49:02.369 --> 00:49:03.650]  I want to get a few calls in.
[00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:13.917]  Anything else, any other observations you've made, and then I'd like you to go back and get your camera, even if it's got only 20 minutes, get back up there and get the video now before they're able to cover anything up.
[00:49:13.917 --> 00:49:14.477]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:14.477 --> 00:49:17.499]  I will do that right now, and I appreciate you taking me call.
[00:49:17.499 --> 00:49:17.639]  Sure.
[00:49:17.639 --> 00:49:18.140]  Well, hold on.
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:22.943]  As you're walking back, though, towards your house or apartment, is it a house or an apartment?
[00:49:23.772 --> 00:49:24.772]  Uh, it is a house.
[00:49:24.772 --> 00:49:42.639]  Okay, well as you're walking back to your house, just want to be accurate, keep giving us a report on basically any other things that come to mind, any other tidbits, anything you haven't told us about what's happened there locally with the previous shooting a few months ago and the drills and the new speakers they put in right in time for this national spectacle.
[00:49:42.639 --> 00:49:45.460]  Yeah, well they definitely did that and this is the first time that they've used them.
[00:49:46.231 --> 00:49:50.872]  And we're coming off of the hills of at least four bomb threats in the past week.
[00:49:50.872 --> 00:49:59.014]  And actually, I take that back, it's more, five or six, because there were multiple bomb threats today in the very area where this was going on.
[00:49:59.014 --> 00:50:06.975]  And it looks like there's a bunch of SWAT coming out of one of the side of the buildings right there, and they're walking off.
[00:50:06.975 --> 00:50:10.816]  And everybody, you can tell that everybody is much more relaxed now.
[00:50:11.917 --> 00:50:12.917]  I'm walking back to the house.
[00:50:12.917 --> 00:50:16.438]  I'm going to go get my video camera and grab some friends with some ditch cams.
[00:50:16.438 --> 00:50:18.379]  Now let me ask you a question.
[00:50:18.379 --> 00:50:19.519]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:50:19.519 --> 00:50:20.759]  Sure, sure.
[00:50:20.759 --> 00:50:23.280]  One last question.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.741]  Look, I'm talking to a radio show, GCN.
[00:50:25.741 --> 00:50:30.642]  I'm a reporter for GCN and I'm just covering this.
[00:50:30.642 --> 00:50:35.223]  I'm walking back to my house, which is right there.
[00:50:35.223 --> 00:50:36.724]  Yes, sir.
[00:50:36.724 --> 00:50:39.345]  He said I should get to my house and stay in my house.
[00:50:41.332 --> 00:50:42.874]  Yeah, they just want to cover things up.
[00:50:42.874 --> 00:50:43.935]  Don't listen to that.
[00:50:43.935 --> 00:50:44.876]  You live there.
[00:50:44.876 --> 00:50:46.177]  You're with the press.
[00:50:46.177 --> 00:50:47.719]  They haven't cordoned anything yet.
[00:50:47.719 --> 00:50:51.043]  So get your cameras and get back over there and get some video.
[00:50:51.043 --> 00:50:54.326]  Alright, I will do that and I'll call you guys back if I get anything.
[00:50:54.326 --> 00:50:57.590]  Okay, the last question I had that I've forgotten about with that cop coming over.
[00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:59.032]  Let me try to bring it back up in memory.
[00:51:01.761 --> 00:51:03.302]  The drills?
[00:51:03.302 --> 00:51:04.823]  Well, we'll talk about the drills.
[00:51:04.823 --> 00:51:05.744]  That's always important.
[00:51:05.744 --> 00:51:07.045]  I use the drills as the cover.
[00:51:07.045 --> 00:51:08.906]  But that's why these are so dangerous, folks.
[00:51:08.906 --> 00:51:11.128]  I've always told you drills are the cover for this.
[00:51:11.128 --> 00:51:12.369]  Let's go back.
[00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:16.271]  Now, if you're having a lot of drills at your school or college, folks, it means you're a prime target.
[00:51:16.271 --> 00:51:17.952]  We've told you this many times.
[00:51:17.952 --> 00:51:21.235]  And again, we're not saying it's a black op, but in my gut, it's looking like that.
[00:51:21.235 --> 00:51:24.477]  And we know we usually call it right 95% of the time.
[00:51:24.477 --> 00:51:25.498]  I wish I was wrong.
[00:51:25.498 --> 00:51:26.659]  Now, go back.
[00:51:26.659 --> 00:51:27.599]  This started at 7.15 this morning.
[00:51:29.688 --> 00:51:39.420]  And it looks like that they didn't even announce until 11 central, noon your time, that it had basically been handled, like 12-15 your time, 7-15 to noon, is 3, 4, 5, 5 hours?
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.641]  This went on 5 hours?
[00:51:40.641 --> 00:51:41.803]  They couldn't stop?
[00:51:46.668 --> 00:51:50.210]  The loudspeaker is around 10 o'clock this morning.
[00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:51.530]  Maybe just after 10.
[00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:52.831]  That's a huge story!
[00:51:52.831 --> 00:51:54.332]  Headline!
[00:51:54.332 --> 00:52:01.335]  School didn't start warning loudspeakers for over 3 hours after shooting.
[00:52:01.335 --> 00:52:03.856]  Eyewitness didn't start the new warnings.
[00:52:03.856 --> 00:52:05.557]  This thing's a total... 3 hours?
[00:52:05.557 --> 00:52:05.797]  Be specific.
[00:52:05.797 --> 00:52:06.037]  Was it 10, 10-15, 10-30?
[00:52:12.604 --> 00:52:13.906]  15 to 10 or 15 after 10.
[00:52:13.906 --> 00:52:24.316]  It was coming into 10 o'clock because the first thing that I thought of when it happened was I'm going to call into the show and I looked at the clock and I knew it would be a few hours and it just got crazy.
[00:52:26.992 --> 00:52:30.056]  So, Dead Reckoning, we'll think back.
[00:52:30.056 --> 00:52:31.959]  We need to be specific about this.
[00:52:31.959 --> 00:52:33.180]  Think back to when you got up.
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:34.482]  Did you look at alarm clocks?
[00:52:34.482 --> 00:52:36.304]  Or what TV show were you watching?
[00:52:36.304 --> 00:52:40.390]  Or whose show was on?
[00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:41.371]  Give us a basic time.
[00:52:41.371 --> 00:52:45.116]  What time did you hear the Big Brother telescreen?
[00:52:46.929 --> 00:52:48.670]  Approximately around 10 o'clock.
[00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:51.631]  Now it could have been 9 30 or something like that.
[00:52:51.631 --> 00:52:54.192]  I will definitely be thinking I'm a little bit flustered from all this.
[00:52:54.192 --> 00:53:00.035]  Anyway, I'm going to go over in my mind and make sure, but I know it was not 7 o'clock.
[00:53:00.035 --> 00:53:00.695]  That's for sure.
[00:53:00.695 --> 00:53:04.197]  I'm thinking it was around approximately 10 o'clock.
[00:53:04.197 --> 00:53:08.398]  I think that they started the alarms when the second shooting started.
[00:53:08.398 --> 00:53:10.979]  So the guy got away from something from them.
[00:53:10.979 --> 00:53:11.620]  They didn't.
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:12.620]  They may have.
[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:14.381]  They detained two people to
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.427]  Um, but I heard that they let one of them go and they're still holding one for questioning.
[00:53:19.427 --> 00:53:28.162]  And, uh, I think that they may have thought that they had it this morning or for whatever reason, they didn't, they, uh, they didn't sound the alarms.
[00:53:29.043 --> 00:53:31.084]  Or maybe not, just on my side of the campus.
[00:53:31.084 --> 00:53:32.685]  The first shooting was all the way across campus.
[00:53:32.685 --> 00:53:35.386]  Well, they should have, the media should have been announcing this.
[00:53:35.386 --> 00:53:41.429]  I mean, if somebody drops a stick of bubblegum on the ground, they'll shut down half the schools in Virginia or Texas.
[00:53:41.429 --> 00:53:48.372]  You know, if there's a killer on the loose or a convict on the loose, now, I mean, think about this, folks.
[00:53:48.912 --> 00:53:51.735]  At least, let's be conservative, two hours after 7-15.
[00:53:51.735 --> 00:53:54.357]  I mean, that's only 9-15.
[00:53:54.357 --> 00:53:55.338]  Let's be conservative.
[00:53:55.338 --> 00:53:59.622]  For at least two hours, they didn't use their news system.
[00:53:59.622 --> 00:54:01.004]  They didn't warn the media.
[00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:02.625]  They kept this thing real quiet.
[00:54:02.625 --> 00:54:07.610]  I'm telling you, this thing stinks like nothing I've ever smelled in the state of Denmark or Louisiana.
[00:54:08.582 --> 00:54:12.024]  Alex, I don't know if the media warned it because I was asleep at that time.
[00:54:12.024 --> 00:54:17.967]  I'll go home and I'll find out right now from their website as to what time it got reported this morning.
[00:54:17.967 --> 00:54:20.628]  I know the way this is a very small community here.
[00:54:20.628 --> 00:54:23.109]  This campus is exploding.
[00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:27.672]  We're just bursting at the seams with too many people in this little small town.
[00:54:27.672 --> 00:54:29.773]  And word travels fast.
[00:54:29.773 --> 00:54:31.954]  So I will go get the timeline down right now.
[00:54:31.954 --> 00:54:35.015]  I'll get my video camera charged up and I'll head back down there.
[00:54:35.015 --> 00:54:35.316]  All right.
[00:54:35.316 --> 00:54:37.957]  Call us back then in the next 20 minutes or so, my friend.
[00:54:38.507 --> 00:54:39.007]  All right.
[00:54:39.007 --> 00:54:39.847]  Good to talk to you, Alex.
[00:54:39.847 --> 00:54:40.447]  Thank you.
[00:54:40.447 --> 00:54:43.308]  Okay, there goes Matt Kazee.
[00:54:43.308 --> 00:54:45.509]  And he runs Mergining Rowing.
[00:54:45.509 --> 00:54:47.269]  It's a 9-11 site I visit every week.
[00:54:47.269 --> 00:54:57.691]  So, just I love all these activists and media, new media people, independent media, alternative media, whatever your term is you like to use.
[00:54:57.691 --> 00:55:01.232]  And my beautiful wife is looking through me through the broadcast window out there.
[00:55:01.232 --> 00:55:02.212]  She's got some breaking news.
[00:55:02.212 --> 00:55:02.692]  Come on in here.
[00:55:02.692 --> 00:55:04.032]  What is it?
[00:55:04.032 --> 00:55:05.813]  Oh, she's just waiting till I come off air.
[00:55:05.813 --> 00:55:06.473]  Is it something hot?
[00:55:07.466 --> 00:55:10.208]  Alright, but you can just run in here with it if you got it.
[00:55:10.208 --> 00:55:14.551]  My wife's always done production for me, but she's doing that full-time now.
[00:55:14.551 --> 00:55:16.012]  It's good to have her here on board with us.
[00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:20.015]  Why don't you come on in there and come on the air?
[00:55:20.015 --> 00:55:21.396]  Maybe later we'll have you on the air sometime.
[00:55:21.396 --> 00:55:22.837]  Okay, fine.
[00:55:22.837 --> 00:55:24.058]  Boy, you're smiling through the window.
[00:55:24.058 --> 00:55:28.341]  It's hard for me not to get distracted.
[00:55:28.341 --> 00:55:31.143]  Anyways, this is a horrible shooting.
[00:55:32.586 --> 00:55:33.166]  What do you say?
[00:55:33.166 --> 00:55:34.347]  I want to go to all your calls.
[00:55:34.347 --> 00:55:37.588]  What I'll do is I'm going to come back from break, and I'm just going to give each person about a minute.
[00:55:37.588 --> 00:55:38.428]  You've been holding forever.
[00:55:38.428 --> 00:55:42.449]  Richard, John, Bill, Chris, others.
[00:55:42.449 --> 00:55:43.670]  Everybody that's holding.
[00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:47.691]  And then we got Larry Pratt popping in just for about 10-15 minutes about victim disarmament.
[00:55:47.691 --> 00:55:48.591]  This is what it leads to.
[00:55:48.591 --> 00:55:50.812]  You know, it's so weird.
[00:55:50.812 --> 00:55:59.155]  I was on the University of Texas campus yesterday, and every 100 yards or so, they got one of these polls that says, call police for help.
[00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:05.318]  And I thought, man, if somebody was running around mugging somebody, I wouldn't run over and put the button and go, Help me!
[00:56:05.318 --> 00:56:05.919]  Help me!
[00:56:05.919 --> 00:56:06.620]  Oh, God!
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:08.002]  Help me!
[00:56:08.002 --> 00:56:09.225]  I've heard those 9-11 tapes.
[00:56:09.225 --> 00:56:10.927]  They're like, He's gonna kill me!
[00:56:10.927 --> 00:56:11.268]  No!
[00:56:11.268 --> 00:56:11.909]  No!
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.201]  It's here.
[00:56:17.201 --> 00:56:22.364]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:56:22.364 --> 00:56:29.989]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:56:30.706 --> 00:56:38.149]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:56:38.149 --> 00:56:49.874]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:56:49.874 --> 00:56:53.856]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:56:53.856 --> 00:56:56.117]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:56:56.117 --> 00:56:59.959]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:57:15.091 --> 00:57:19.952]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:57:19.952 --> 00:57:24.314]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:57:24.314 --> 00:57:25.194]  We listened.
[00:57:25.194 --> 00:57:30.435]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:57:30.435 --> 00:57:31.316]  We listened.
[00:57:31.316 --> 00:57:34.777]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:57:34.777 --> 00:57:35.777]  We listened.
[00:57:35.777 --> 00:57:39.138]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[00:57:40.203 --> 00:57:41.044]  We listened.
[00:57:41.044 --> 00:57:46.687]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:57:46.687 --> 00:57:48.408]  Again, we listened.
[00:57:48.408 --> 00:57:51.630]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested
[00:57:53.035 --> 00:57:54.236]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:58:12.518 --> 00:58:14.459]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:58:14.459 --> 00:58:18.481]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:58:18.481 --> 00:58:27.565]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:58:27.565 --> 00:58:32.687]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[00:58:32.687 --> 00:58:34.428]  Every time you walk away from your computer,
[00:58:34.428 --> 00:58:35.028]  We're good to go.
[00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:54.904]  There's no software to load, and it's so easy to install.

[00:59:52.351 --> 00:59:55.494]  Larry Pratt joins us, coming up in about five minutes.
[00:59:55.494 --> 00:59:56.435]  Then Aaron Zellman.
[00:59:56.435 --> 01:00:01.380]  Aaron Zellman, I had remembered some controversy with Virginia Tech.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:03.242]  Virginia has a concealed carry.
[01:00:03.242 --> 01:00:08.147]  Virginia Tech banned guns, brought in the federal law and state law.
[01:00:09.329 --> 01:00:10.230]  There.
[01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:19.734]  And they have brought on their hands, this is out of the Roanoke Times, April 13, 2005, Virginia Tech's gun ban on a Maid Raw legal fire.
[01:00:19.734 --> 01:00:21.215]  And they're murderers, folks.
[01:00:21.215 --> 01:00:21.975]  They are murderers.
[01:00:21.975 --> 01:00:29.139]  And it's not just the government murdering them in absentia or from an indirect way.
[01:00:29.139 --> 01:00:32.741]  This thing has Black Op written all over it.
[01:00:33.436 --> 01:00:35.457]  See, it's got this fog and all this confusion.
[01:00:35.457 --> 01:00:36.817]  I don't know how to even explain it.
[01:00:36.817 --> 01:00:38.497]  It's like, it becomes like an art form.
[01:00:38.497 --> 01:00:40.258]  You just don't know how to look at it.
[01:00:40.258 --> 01:00:45.399]  And, uh, it just, it reeks of black op.
[01:00:45.399 --> 01:00:47.279]  Ugh, and then, it's just amazing.
[01:00:47.279 --> 01:00:48.140]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.160]  Let's, uh, go to them.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.761]  And I got the big Rosie O'Donnell news I will spend some time on.
[01:00:52.761 --> 01:00:56.902]  Uh, let's go to, um, Richard in Canada.
[01:00:56.902 --> 01:00:57.682]  Richard, you're on the air.
[01:00:57.682 --> 01:00:58.202]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:59.053 --> 01:01:00.234]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:01:00.234 --> 01:01:00.874]  This is Richard.
[01:01:00.874 --> 01:01:03.375]  I'm so happy to finally get in touch with you.
[01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:06.056]  It's been a while and I just want to congratulate you.
[01:01:06.056 --> 01:01:08.417]  You're a leader, brave, you're courageous.
[01:01:08.417 --> 01:01:24.285]  I've watched all your documents and actually the funny thing is that when I was waiting on like this breaking news came but what I wanted to tell you was that I actually woke up last year because I am an international student here and I was pulled out of a bathroom stall
[01:01:25.041 --> 01:01:36.672]  By a police officer on campus and I was given no reason why and when I went back in to figure out why in the police station they basically told me they were doing their job and that was it.
[01:01:36.672 --> 01:01:40.435]  I felt like all my rights were taken away and after that like I kind of woke up
[01:01:41.233 --> 01:01:53.979]  This is why they love mass shootings, because it creates the fear, and now they're gonna have metal detectors and frisk and barbed wire, and the schools will be prisons, and they're shooting at businesses, their prisons shooting at the... It's everything's a prison now.
[01:01:53.979 --> 01:01:56.840]  Terrorists attack an airport, we're prisoners there.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.921]  They attack a bus, now we gotta have searches.
[01:01:58.921 --> 01:02:00.042]  I mean, it's just total control.
[01:02:00.562 --> 01:02:08.006]  It is, and Alex, the funny thing is that I think it's already been done, because, like, they knew where I was in that same bathroom, like, the week before.
[01:02:08.006 --> 01:02:11.187]  Like, they told me what I was doing, and I was like, how do you know that?
[01:02:11.187 --> 01:02:13.749]  And they couldn't even... Man, they pulled me out of the stall.
[01:02:13.749 --> 01:02:15.310]  They didn't even tell me who they were.
[01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:17.010]  They took all my information.
[01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:18.311]  They took my ID.
[01:02:18.311 --> 01:02:25.935]  I felt so dehumanized, and I actually... I did get some recourse, because instead of going back to the people in authority, I went to the business department, and
[01:02:26.355 --> 01:02:30.599]  I told them what happened, and they got so worried because I threatened to go to the media.
[01:02:30.599 --> 01:02:32.840]  And because they thought I would just sit down and take it, you know?
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.202]  But that woke me up, and that's what we realized.
[01:02:35.202 --> 01:02:37.404]  Well, you know why they knew what you were doing?
[01:02:37.404 --> 01:02:43.028]  They've got video cameras in most bathrooms now at colleges and high schools and middle schools.
[01:02:43.028 --> 01:02:48.092]  And a lot of times, they've got them in the showers, and the principals trade them amongst themselves.
[01:02:48.092 --> 01:02:48.693]  That's been in the news.
[01:02:49.153 --> 01:02:50.054]  Yeah, and you're totally right.
[01:02:50.054 --> 01:02:54.598]  It's so funny to know that, like, everything's so controlled, yet so many things happen.
[01:02:54.598 --> 01:03:01.083]  Look, if you're in a rest stop or a university or a school, and you're on the commode, just know they're videotaping most of the time.
[01:03:01.083 --> 01:03:08.790]  Definitely, and Alex, you're so right, because if they have so much, like, surveillance, how do all these things just appear out of the blue and happen, and they can't control it?
[01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:16.537]  I mean... Well, notice England has, you know, 14 million cameras just in the surrounding London area, four plus million in London.
[01:03:17.177 --> 01:03:19.299]  And it's like 50-something million nationwide.
[01:03:19.299 --> 01:03:20.820]  You can go look the numbers up.
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:24.283]  I'm going from memory there, but I know it's four and a half million in London.
[01:03:24.283 --> 01:03:25.203]  That was a couple years ago.
[01:03:25.203 --> 01:03:26.024]  It gets worse.
[01:03:26.024 --> 01:03:30.207]  Now they have telescreens that shout orders at you in a child's voice.
[01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:32.829]  And their crime actually exploded with that.
[01:03:32.829 --> 01:03:38.333]  This is so they can carry out their terror attacks and know who saw it and know who could expose them.
[01:03:39.537 --> 01:03:53.181]  I just want to congratulate you and one day you're going to reach a place that you know all your work is going to pay off and people will wake up to what you're trying to say and keep up what you're doing and I'm not even from the States and I'm not from North America.
[01:03:53.181 --> 01:03:57.742]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:04:03.715 --> 01:04:06.938]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:06.938 --> 01:04:11.101]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:13.723]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:04:13.723 --> 01:04:16.245]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:04:16.245 --> 01:04:24.772]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:04:24.772 --> 01:04:26.213]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:04:26.213 --> 01:04:32.218]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[01:04:32.378 --> 01:04:44.246]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:04:44.246 --> 01:04:50.750]  It is so powerful, it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:55.614]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:04:55.614 --> 01:04:56.294]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:05.982 --> 01:05:08.364]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:05:08.364 --> 01:05:12.989]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:05:12.989 --> 01:05:14.070]  Big Brother.
[01:05:19.025 --> 01:05:20.787]  Mainstream media.
[01:05:20.787 --> 01:05:22.549]  Government cover-ups.
[01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:24.130]  You want answers?
[01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:25.692]  Well, so does he.
[01:05:25.692 --> 01:05:29.876]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:05:29.876 --> 01:05:33.980]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:05:53.878 --> 01:05:55.399]  We're going to get to your other calls.
[01:05:55.399 --> 01:05:59.203]  We've got Aaron Zellman joining us, coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:05:59.203 --> 01:06:03.767]  The founder and head of Jewish Preservation of Firearms ownership.
[01:06:03.767 --> 01:06:12.394]  Larry Pratt, the man who leads Gunners of America, one of the few real Second Amendment organizations in the country, is our guest.
[01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:28.869]  Larry Pratt, we've seen a great tragedy and out of the gates we know that Virginia Tech had a zero gun policy and had invoked and brought in federal and state laws even though Virginia had a concealed carry where you live and the blood is on their hands.
[01:06:28.869 --> 01:06:31.011]  That is my take on it.
[01:06:31.011 --> 01:06:36.175]  If this happened anywhere where people were able to have guns, this guy would have been blown away in short order.
[01:06:36.175 --> 01:06:38.837]  Instead, this may be one of the biggest mass killings in U.S.
[01:06:38.837 --> 01:06:39.938]  history.
[01:06:39.938 --> 01:06:42.860]  Alex, you're right on the money and one of the
[01:06:43.633 --> 01:07:02.723]  uh... sickening ironies of this tragedy is the uh... virginia tech president who oppose the legislation uh... in the legislature this year that would have opened an exception uh... for concealed carry permit holders to have guns on
[01:07:04.183 --> 01:07:06.384]  And let's explain something to that scumbag.
[01:07:06.384 --> 01:07:10.965]  Criminals and psychopaths are not going to follow the law.
[01:07:10.965 --> 01:07:15.506]  All you do is endanger us, and I'm sick of it!
[01:07:15.506 --> 01:07:25.948]  It's an amazing mindset that assumes that, well, we've said that it's going to be illegal to have a gun on the campus, and so therefore, what's your problem?
[01:07:25.948 --> 01:07:29.228]  It's also illegal to kill 35 people!
[01:07:29.228 --> 01:07:30.289]  Duh!
[01:07:30.289 --> 01:07:32.069]  That one doesn't seem to connect
[01:07:32.529 --> 01:07:49.362]  to these guys and yet the president and I hope these words ring in his ears until the day he dies and preferably it'll be a long time that he spends not being the president of the university well the university is going to be much safer because today that bill died in committee
[01:07:50.407 --> 01:07:52.329]  He said that.
[01:07:52.329 --> 01:07:54.650]  This very piece of trash said that.
[01:07:54.650 --> 01:07:55.831]  Those are his very words.
[01:07:55.831 --> 01:07:59.974]  He was convinced that he was making the university safe.
[01:07:59.974 --> 01:08:03.917]  He hasn't learned anything from any of our history.
[01:08:03.917 --> 01:08:05.458]  This is amazing!
[01:08:05.458 --> 01:08:15.385]  We've got anti-gun activist university that's had two shooting sprees in less than a year on it, with cops and citizens getting blown away.
[01:08:15.385 --> 01:08:17.587]  Listen, Larry, and I know, we've got to seize this.
[01:08:17.807 --> 01:08:21.349]  One of the things to point out, and you're absolutely right, we must be on the offensive.
[01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:25.911]  We're preparing a media statement that says that the problem at Virginia Tech was that there weren't enough guns.
[01:08:25.911 --> 01:08:27.712]  The thing that we can remind these Jaspers of is that
[01:08:46.639 --> 01:08:58.730]  Approximately two hours down the road, still in Virginia, in Grundy, Virginia, there's the Appalachian School of Law, which about four years ago was the scene of something rather similar.
[01:08:58.730 --> 01:09:05.156]  A student, apparently, both students, we think that the shooter today is a student,
[01:09:06.597 --> 01:09:14.182]  Go onto the campus, first victim is a professor and obviously intentions of killing lots more.
[01:09:14.182 --> 01:09:26.230]  At the first sounds of the gunshots, two of the law students went to their cars, which of course were off the campus as the law would require because they had firearms in them.
[01:09:26.230 --> 01:09:31.153]  They got their firearms, they went to the scene of the crime and subdued the killer.
[01:09:31.833 --> 01:09:37.177]  Saving, perhaps, another mass murder of the proportions that we witnessed today.
[01:09:37.177 --> 01:09:43.082]  But there were none of those students today that were able to do that.
[01:09:43.082 --> 01:09:54.570]  Another school shooting that ended rather prematurely from the shooter's point of view was in Pearl, Mississippi, where the assistant principal was able to go, similar scenario, get his gun, stop the shooter.
[01:09:56.835 --> 01:10:05.223]  No, we've gotta wait like Columbine, four hours and fifteen minutes, while the SWAT teams dress up in Darth Vader outfits and do absolutely nothing.
[01:10:05.223 --> 01:10:06.625]  Well, let me just tell everybody something.
[01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:12.470]  Anybody comes in my business, threatening people with a gun, I'm not, we don't call the police, you're gonna die.
[01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.991]  We'll be right back.
[01:10:16.616 --> 01:10:20.162]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:10:20.162 --> 01:10:22.466]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:10:22.466 --> 01:10:30.119]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:10:30.808 --> 01:10:38.252]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:10:38.252 --> 01:10:49.977]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:10:49.977 --> 01:10:53.959]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:10:53.959 --> 01:10:56.200]  It's an anthology of government crimes.

[01:11:13.194 --> 01:11:18.358]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:25.824]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:11:25.824 --> 01:11:36.653]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:11:36.653 --> 01:11:41.497]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:11:41.497 --> 01:11:42.218]  Unbelievably
[01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:46.681]  They even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:49.843]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:11:49.843 --> 01:11:59.730]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.

[01:12:14.679 --> 01:12:20.541]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:12:20.541 --> 01:12:25.663]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:12:25.663 --> 01:12:28.784]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:12:28.784 --> 01:12:32.966]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:12:32.966 --> 01:12:37.748]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:12:37.748 --> 01:12:40.869]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:12:41.508 --> 01:12:45.151]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:12:45.151 --> 01:12:47.332]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.

[01:13:14.335 --> 01:13:17.099]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:13:17.099 --> 01:13:19.922]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:13:43.115 --> 01:13:44.575]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:44.575 --> 01:13:47.656]  Larry Pratt, the head of Gunners of America, joins us.
[01:13:47.656 --> 01:13:49.676]  And it was hard for him to get a word in edgewise.
[01:13:49.676 --> 01:13:52.317]  I'm so angry about all of this.
[01:13:52.317 --> 01:13:54.197]  I'm tired of these people that come in here.
[01:13:54.197 --> 01:13:56.778]  They've been running our country for the last 40 years.
[01:13:56.778 --> 01:13:59.859]  The control freaks.
[01:13:59.859 --> 01:14:01.619]  And your children could play out on the street.
[01:14:01.619 --> 01:14:05.320]  They could go out and play on the sidewalk or at the park without fear.
[01:14:06.352 --> 01:14:12.275]  And because we have degenerated with the culture, and there are a few more sickos out there, their answer is, come take our guns.
[01:14:12.275 --> 01:14:15.276]  And I've been around mainline liberals, folks.
[01:14:15.276 --> 01:14:27.161]  And I remember one time I was over at my dad's house when I was in college, and one of his friends, the editor of a major magazine, I mean, editor of a national magazine, I'm not going to say which one, he's still there.
[01:14:28.948 --> 01:14:40.455]  You know, friends since I was a little kid was there, and my, for some reason, I was, oh yeah, I was storing my guns there because I was in, you know, college, and I just didn't have a whole bunch of them when I was still in an apartment, but I didn't have all my guns in one spot.
[01:14:40.455 --> 01:14:54.723]  Point is, I came home, was getting a rifle and a handgun, I was going out to the ranch to go do some shooting with friends, and I'm walking out of my parents' bedroom, and then out down the stairs to the living room,
[01:14:55.829 --> 01:15:02.392]  And I've got one in a gun case, and the other is in a little .357 Magnum pistol, you know, a little soft case.
[01:15:02.392 --> 01:15:03.973]  And he goes, what is that?
[01:15:03.973 --> 01:15:04.754]  And I said, it's a gun.
[01:15:04.754 --> 01:15:05.854]  He went, oh!
[01:15:05.854 --> 01:15:09.056]  And he was, like, leaning back on the couch, going, my God, my God!
[01:15:09.056 --> 01:15:11.857]  But he'll see cops all day with machine guns, and he feels safe.
[01:15:11.857 --> 01:15:13.578]  And I went, no, it's no big deal.
[01:15:13.578 --> 01:15:14.198]  They're not loaded.
[01:15:14.198 --> 01:15:15.019]  Oh, they always say that.
[01:15:15.019 --> 01:15:15.679]  And I went, no, no, no, no.
[01:15:16.696 --> 01:15:17.376]  They're not loaded.
[01:15:17.376 --> 01:15:18.817]  The ammo's out in my car.
[01:15:18.817 --> 01:15:19.917]  But it's no big deal if they were.
[01:15:19.917 --> 01:15:21.818]  I've been talking gun safety since I was a child.
[01:15:21.818 --> 01:15:22.838]  My dad's like, it's alright.
[01:15:22.838 --> 01:15:23.178]  Here, look.
[01:15:23.178 --> 01:15:24.539]  And he got it and unzipped it.
[01:15:24.539 --> 01:15:25.579]  And he goes, see, it's unloaded.
[01:15:25.579 --> 01:15:25.699]  Look.
[01:15:25.699 --> 01:15:28.120]  And he was going, oh!
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.541]  I mean, literally just, oh, oh!
[01:15:30.541 --> 01:15:37.223]  Like it was a King Cobra had come in and it opened up its fan and was about to strike, dripping venom.
[01:15:37.223 --> 01:15:43.725]  Larry Pratt, how do we... Now, of course, the government wants to disarm us, to enslave us and control us, but there really is a mass of people out there that just don't get it, Larry.
[01:15:44.634 --> 01:15:53.696]  ...to a mindset that is very much a problem and is contributing to a worsening in our country of the perception of guns.
[01:15:53.696 --> 01:16:00.857]  It's the zero tolerance, which it sounds like your editor friend may have been one of the originators of.
[01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:11.939]  If you see a gun, wet your pants, suck your thumb, and just basically be immobile until the big brave man with his bulletproof vest gets there to save you.
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:19.444]  It's the most incredible, I'm helpless, save-me-from-myself kind of way of thinking.
[01:16:19.444 --> 01:16:26.549]  And it's a very dangerous way of thinking, as we've just seen so sickeningly today at Virginia Tech.
[01:16:26.549 --> 01:16:31.692]  One of the early accounts depicted something that was right out of Columbine.
[01:16:31.692 --> 01:16:42.039]  Students were reported to have been cowering in their classrooms, under their desks, trying to do whatever they could to remain safe.
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:48.185]  Well, the best thing they could have done to remain safe would have been to pull out a piece and go get the bum.
[01:16:48.185 --> 01:16:57.895]  And because they were victim disarmed, they should have gone rampage to kick out the wire mesh, you know, like animals in a sinking ship clawing to get out.
[01:16:57.895 --> 01:17:00.077]  They should have been up against the edge of the door.
[01:17:00.077 --> 01:17:02.920]  The minute that person comes in, you just savagely attack them.
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.062]  I mean, if you can't escape, you might as well fight!
[01:17:06.062 --> 01:17:11.705]  If you're going to take a bullet, you might as well charge the piece of dirt, because, well, you might take a bullet.
[01:17:11.705 --> 01:17:12.205]  Ha!
[01:17:12.205 --> 01:17:13.506]  Duh!
[01:17:13.506 --> 01:17:16.288]  But you're not going to kneel down while they splatter your brains everywhere.
[01:17:16.288 --> 01:17:24.553]  You're going to probably take one in the gut of the shoulder and live, and then others are going to pile on and help you, and that son of a bitch, excuse my French, isn't going to be able to kill you.
[01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:28.075]  Well, that would be what should happen.
[01:17:28.075 --> 01:17:44.486]  It clearly didn't, and the sickening thing, the most sickening thing that I've heard so far, and I'm sure it'll be topped, but was a room full of people that this piece of dirt had gone into, lined them up and they just stood there waiting to be shot from this early account.
[01:17:44.486 --> 01:17:45.687]  I hope that's not true.
[01:17:46.648 --> 01:17:48.510]  Absolute limbing behavior.
[01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:50.432]  What has happened to Americans?
[01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:57.621]  Once the most feared, upright, individualistic, aggressive people, and they've turned us into literal jellyfish.
[01:17:58.334 --> 01:18:01.856]  Well, I think the battle really lies there.
[01:18:01.856 --> 01:18:11.683]  That friend that you so vividly described having his paroxysms of fear on the sofa in your parents' house.
[01:18:11.683 --> 01:18:13.264]  By the way, I wasn't joking.
[01:18:13.264 --> 01:18:16.946]  No, I'm quite sure that was quite accurate.
[01:18:16.946 --> 01:18:20.189]  He probably decided that it was the last time he was going to go to Texas.
[01:18:20.189 --> 01:18:21.329]  They're all nuts down there.
[01:18:25.993 --> 01:18:31.278]  That's the worldview that really plays into the hands of the disarmament crowd.
[01:18:31.278 --> 01:18:41.989]  Well, I mean, back when I lived in an apartment, I'd go deer hunting a couple times a year, and I'd, you know, and I learned to always even cover the case in a blanket, because somebody will see a gun case and go, I mean, literally,
[01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:47.734]  Now I know why hunters so typically go early in the morning.
[01:18:47.734 --> 01:18:57.362]  Before the sun comes up here, I thought it was because that's the best time to surprise Bambi, but actually it's because you have to sneak out to the car so none of the neighbors will see you.
[01:18:58.922 --> 01:18:59.703]  I'm not kidding.
[01:18:59.703 --> 01:19:17.250]  I mean, in a free country, even at my house, when I get a rifle out of the gun safe to go to the target range, and a lot of times, you know, they're in there, not in cases, I'll grab, you know, my Remington 700, and I go out the back door, I look, I hit the open on the back of my trunk, I lay it in, I'm looking both ways, because, I mean, there's just cowardly jellyfish everywhere.
[01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:26.034]  You know, I had a carpet cleaner at my house about eight, nine years ago, and I had a shotgun, before I had children, on an open rack up on the wall in my broadcast studio out of my house.
[01:19:26.734 --> 01:19:31.738]  And, uh, it was just a cheap defender, pump action, you know, just for defense.
[01:19:31.738 --> 01:19:34.279]  And, uh, the carpet cleaner guy goes, is that legal?
[01:19:34.279 --> 01:19:36.961]  And I said, don't call the police on me.
[01:19:36.961 --> 01:19:43.686]  And then later, I had a bad feeling, and I called the carpet cleaning place, and the owner got on and said, no, I know who you are, Alex, don't worry.
[01:19:43.686 --> 01:19:45.307]  Yeah, he did come back.
[01:19:45.307 --> 01:19:46.928]  He did want to call the police on you.
[01:19:46.928 --> 01:19:48.809]  We explained that it was legal.
[01:19:48.809 --> 01:19:53.392]  Well, then they watch cop shows that are set in New York, where they always go, we found a gun in his house.
[01:19:53.392 --> 01:19:55.674]  See, these people, they believe TV is the real world.
[01:19:56.034 --> 01:20:02.196]  We found an arsenal, and they'll show you a picture of two or three guns.
[01:20:02.196 --> 01:20:08.498]  That hardly cuts it for an arsenal in my book, but then one gun is an arsenal for these people.
[01:20:08.498 --> 01:20:11.798]  As we're talking about this, the thought has crossed my mind.
[01:20:11.798 --> 01:20:23.962]  I am so blessed to have the luxury of an attached garage, so that I can sneak my guns out into the garage, into the car, without having to draw attention to myself.
[01:20:25.603 --> 01:20:40.520]  Pity the poor guy like you when you were that student in the apartment that had to leave an apartment and walk down who knows how many flights of stairs and how many hallways so that who knows how many people might see you and absolutely ruin their day.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:52.052]  And again, they think all guns are illegal, and then Handgun Control Incorporated, sworn to disarm the American people, in the words of Sarah Brady, so we can have, quote, socialism, that is, enforce it.
[01:20:52.052 --> 01:21:02.843]  They have these billboards from Galveston, Texas to Kansas City, Missouri, that show a revolver, and it says, Report Illegal Guns, but then when you read in real small print,
[01:21:03.663 --> 01:21:06.624]  It says, you know, those violating gun laws.
[01:21:06.624 --> 01:21:12.627]  There's no law against having the revolver, but that's to brainwash the public for the perception it's illegal.
[01:21:12.627 --> 01:21:21.230]  That is the part of the battle that we're fighting, and it's probably a more serious problem that we're fighting than the laws themselves.
[01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:38.535]  If anything, we've seen modest progress at the state level, where concealed carry laws have been passed and then expanded, where stand your ground legislation where you don't have to retreat, not only in your house, but now increasingly out on the street.
[01:21:38.535 --> 01:21:40.476]  Those kinds of laws are very positive.
[01:21:40.476 --> 01:21:43.397]  Also, you might consider that Utah and Oregon
[01:21:43.997 --> 01:21:51.705]  Are the only two states that presently have used a little bit of freedom that was allowed by the federal ban on guns at school.
[01:21:51.705 --> 01:22:06.279]  How do we get back to the point where my dad could, because you know, his mother would, when she was a school teacher, sometimes she was teaching at different schools, and when he was at, you know, they would drive him to one spot where the bus would come pick him up in the country, but they'd go into a pretty big, you know, country school, and they would just
[01:22:07.302 --> 01:22:22.530]  I walk right in, Larry, with their shotguns and their rounds, their shotgun shells, and they'd put them right in their school locker, and a lot of times they'd go with the coaches or the principal dove hunting, but they just all walked in during bird season with their guns into the public school.
[01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:27.312]  I mean, now you're in the country walking down the side of the road with a shotgun, a cop will pull over and ask what you're doing.
[01:22:27.312 --> 01:22:28.133]  What happened to us?
[01:22:28.593 --> 01:22:30.634]  Yours was a kind of an upscale school.
[01:22:30.634 --> 01:22:33.916]  I've talked to a number of people that didn't have the lockers.
[01:22:33.916 --> 01:22:38.119]  They just put them in the cloakroom alongside of or behind the classroom.
[01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:39.900]  So it was quite open.
[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.342]  It wasn't anybody's personal locker at all.
[01:22:42.342 --> 01:22:44.303]  Anybody could have walked in there and gotten a gun.
[01:22:44.303 --> 01:22:50.967]  And somehow, not only did the gun not go off by itself, but none of the kids went in there and did anything stupid with it.
[01:22:51.207 --> 01:22:57.651]  Now, the difference was, though, when you were being taught gun safety, if you did anything that wasn't the total gun safety, you'd get the hell beat out of you.
[01:22:57.651 --> 01:22:59.892]  They'd holler your head off, for starters.
[01:22:59.892 --> 01:23:05.095]  You knew that you were in big trouble if you did anything stupid with a gun.
[01:23:05.095 --> 01:23:15.280]  You feared what the range master or your dad or whoever was going to do to you a lot more than whatever might possibly be done with that gun.
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:19.683]  Because you knew that something was going to happen right away if you were careless.
[01:23:20.123 --> 01:23:23.044]  And so people obviously learned.
[01:23:23.044 --> 01:23:25.065]  It's a pretty good way to learn.
[01:23:25.065 --> 01:23:37.849]  And we've had members tell us about their trips to the shooting range at school in New York City, taking their cased rifles onto the subway in New York City.
[01:23:37.849 --> 01:23:45.391]  Now, if you think that the guy in the country is going to have trouble walking with his gun today, imagine trying to go to school.
[01:23:45.391 --> 01:23:48.432]  Well, first of all, they don't have those shooting ranges in operation anymore.
[01:23:49.212 --> 01:23:50.853]  But imagine what would happen.
[01:23:50.853 --> 01:23:57.837]  They'd probably close off every exit of one of those subways if somebody were reported to be doing that.
[01:23:57.837 --> 01:24:02.079]  Now notice how they take the gun ranges away and the schools and suddenly all the shootings start.
[01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:03.420]  Larry, let's get down to brass tacks.
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:10.944]  I don't know about this case, but there's definitely been some fishy stuff at Columbine and other places where it looks like government's provocateuring are involved.
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:22.867]  Well, there was a massive cover-up of the incompetence of the Sheriff's Department in Jefferson County, which is Columbine, out in Colorado, in the Denver suburbs.
[01:24:22.867 --> 01:24:26.750]  So, in fact, it got to be so bad that the Sheriff was not re-elected.
[01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:34.074]  And we keep finding out things that he was trying to cover up just to make his incompetence look like it wasn't so bad.
[01:24:34.074 --> 01:24:39.276]  There were plenty of warnings ahead of time that were neglected.
[01:24:39.276 --> 01:24:42.398]  And then when the officers got there, there was confusion.
[01:24:42.398 --> 01:24:45.499]  It was kind of risk aversion.
[01:24:45.499 --> 01:24:49.521]  You know, don't have a cop put himself in any risk at all.
[01:24:49.521 --> 01:24:52.303]  So they just waited until everybody was dead and then they went in.
[01:24:54.024 --> 01:24:59.288]  30, 40 years ago, because I've studied the cases, you couldn't stop police from charging in after a gunman.
[01:24:59.288 --> 01:25:05.353]  And that was the impulse, I think, of a lot of the officers there, but they were told, stand down.
[01:25:05.353 --> 01:25:09.416]  That's what was so terrible about it, and I think that was part of the odor that got rid of them.
[01:25:09.416 --> 01:25:11.657]  Yeah, they're trying to break the manhood out of us.
[01:25:11.657 --> 01:25:12.718]  We'll be right back with Larry Pratt.
[01:25:13.562 --> 01:25:16.883]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:25:16.883 --> 01:25:22.065]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:25:22.065 --> 01:25:26.707]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:25:26.707 --> 01:25:35.830]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:39.431]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:25:39.731 --> 01:25:45.059]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:25:45.059 --> 01:25:51.749]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:25:52.273 --> 01:25:53.574]  What about you?
[01:25:53.574 --> 01:25:58.999]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:25:58.999 --> 01:26:00.160]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:02.061]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:26:14.875 --> 01:26:18.938]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:26:18.938 --> 01:26:24.842]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:26:24.842 --> 01:26:25.943]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:26:25.943 --> 01:26:30.646]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:26:30.646 --> 01:26:43.895]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:26:44.455 --> 01:26:50.059]  For this reason Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:26:50.059 --> 01:26:56.704]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:26:56.704 --> 01:26:58.185]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:26:58.185 --> 01:27:03.168]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:27:03.168 --> 01:27:03.829]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:27:03.829 --> 01:27:05.990]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.050]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:27:14.742 --> 01:27:21.466]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:27:21.466 --> 01:27:25.749]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:27:25.749 --> 01:27:28.250]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:35.615]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[01:27:35.615 --> 01:27:38.477]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:27:38.477 --> 01:27:41.959]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[01:27:42.239 --> 01:27:50.522]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:27:50.522 --> 01:27:52.283]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:27:52.283 --> 01:28:04.188]  You'll find Nonex Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[01:28:04.689 --> 01:28:07.395]  Or online at drugstore.com.
[01:28:07.395 --> 01:28:12.767]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:28:14.867 --> 01:28:15.388]  Attention!
[01:28:15.388 --> 01:28:18.490]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[01:28:18.490 --> 01:28:23.113]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:28:23.113 --> 01:28:24.454]  Listen closely.
[01:28:24.454 --> 01:28:32.220]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:41.307]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[01:28:41.307 --> 01:28:44.249]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country,
[01:28:44.469 --> 01:28:47.070]  No health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:56.735]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[01:28:56.735 --> 01:29:02.557]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[01:29:02.557 --> 01:29:06.359]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[01:29:06.359 --> 01:29:09.701]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:30.631]  We've got Matt Kazeeves with 9-11 Truth there.
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.181]  In Blacksburg, Virginia.
[01:29:33.181 --> 01:29:34.382]  He lives on the campus.
[01:29:34.382 --> 01:29:39.066]  He's already been down there for us with a live report with the SWAT teams and people telling him to get back.
[01:29:39.066 --> 01:29:40.066]  He went further than the media.
[01:29:40.066 --> 01:29:40.967]  He's back there now.
[01:29:40.967 --> 01:29:42.729]  We're about to go to him on cell phone.
[01:29:42.729 --> 01:29:45.531]  Larry Pratt at GunOwners.org.
[01:29:45.531 --> 01:29:58.341]  Larry, how do we, in a nutshell, get on the offensive and get the truth out that it again is victim disarmament, inaction, and that the school needs to be held accountable instead of turning every university in the country into little prison camps?
[01:29:58.976 --> 01:30:05.404]  Well the one thing that Gun Owners of America is set up to do is of course provide a voice for grassroots activism.
[01:30:05.404 --> 01:30:13.253]  We have on our website gunowners.org an email alert system and I can assure you that shortly we're going to be renewing
[01:30:13.886 --> 01:30:24.436]  Our campaign to end this senseless, dangerous, reckless kind of legislation that's on the books right now that prohibits people from defending themselves.
[01:30:24.436 --> 01:30:32.463]  It's okay to defend yourself in most states if you have a concealed carry permit and you're in a 7-11, but God help you if you're on a school grounds.
[01:30:32.463 --> 01:30:34.245]  That's nuts to assume that somehow
[01:30:34.585 --> 01:30:35.765]  Those are the targets!
[01:30:35.765 --> 01:30:43.287]  Now Larry, I've read the different policies and basically if a shooter is even in the school, they lock down.
[01:30:43.287 --> 01:30:48.509]  That's going to result sometime in 100 plus dead, not just 32 as they're now reporting.
[01:30:48.509 --> 01:30:53.210]  How do we reverse that insane stance of we lock the children in like it's fish in a barrel?
[01:30:55.057 --> 01:31:00.981]  The whole concept, as we were talking about earlier, is rooted in, if you do nothing, you'll be okay.
[01:31:00.981 --> 01:31:04.143]  If you have no defense, that's a good defense.
[01:31:04.143 --> 01:31:05.144]  They're brainwashing us!
[01:31:05.144 --> 01:31:08.906]  You just lay there and take it to go to the FEMA camps, basically.
[01:31:08.906 --> 01:31:17.832]  Just to lie there and take it, no matter what is happening, whether it's government abuse or whether it's a thug like the one at the Virginia Tech campus.
[01:31:17.832 --> 01:31:23.056]  Thank God at Appalachian School of Law that there were a couple of students who were willing and able
[01:31:23.516 --> 01:31:24.537]  To do something.
[01:31:24.537 --> 01:31:38.305]  By the way, one of the things that we should emphasize is the media doesn't like to report the good things that can happen, such as the Appalachian School of Law, where students with guns actually stopped the killing.
[01:31:38.305 --> 01:31:39.646]  They were convinced in the media.
[01:31:39.646 --> 01:31:51.494]  We know from one Associated Press editor, oh well, if we start telling people about those young men introducing guns into an already dangerous situation, why that would just be reckless to report that.
[01:31:51.494 --> 01:31:51.954]  And so they did
[01:31:52.294 --> 01:31:57.559]  I don't even want to call them effeminate men because women will stand up and fight a lot of times.
[01:31:57.559 --> 01:32:00.242]  These aren't even... I don't know what to call them.
[01:32:00.242 --> 01:32:02.724]  These are these chicken-necked...
[01:32:03.363 --> 01:32:16.011]  Cowardly little twits who never lived in the real world, who live in these little pampered high-rises, I guess, in the big cities, and they want us to all be a bunch of cowards like them, and I'm sorry, it's just not going to happen.
[01:32:16.011 --> 01:32:23.056]  Well, and we know what happens in England after they ban guns there and they have a murder rate and a violent crime rate that shoots off the charts.
[01:32:23.776 --> 01:32:29.080]  The response is, oh, well, we need to ban knives and we need to ban replica guns.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:37.865]  And you can just see them adding to the list of banned items as if, well, the criminals didn't cooperate in getting rid of the guns in England.
[01:32:37.865 --> 01:32:41.367]  In fact, there's twice the number of illegal guns there now.
[01:32:41.367 --> 01:32:42.968]  And their crime rates exploded.
[01:32:42.968 --> 01:32:43.989]  That's the UN's own numbers.
[01:32:44.449 --> 01:32:45.910]  Absolutely correct.
[01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:47.750]  That is the source of that.
[01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:53.433]  The worst of all 18 industrialized countries in the UN study, England.
[01:32:53.433 --> 01:32:54.973]  The highest violent crime rate.
[01:32:54.973 --> 01:32:56.114]  Worse than the United States.
[01:32:56.114 --> 01:32:59.395]  Larry Pratt, check in with us tomorrow if you can, briefly.
[01:32:59.395 --> 01:33:00.696]  Sir, give out the website.
[01:33:00.696 --> 01:33:07.699]  Gunowners.org is the place to go for the action, folks, and hopefully you'll do that, because we'll be sending out an alert on this soon enough.
[01:33:07.699 --> 01:33:09.359]  And it's clear that we've got to mobilize.
[01:33:09.359 --> 01:33:13.421]  This is going to be the starting gun, pun intended, for a new attack on the Second Amendment.
[01:33:13.922 --> 01:33:19.221]  Absolutely, and I'm glad you've triggered our defense if you'll let me continue that line of discussion.
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.560]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:24.181]  We really appreciate you, and we'll talk to you tomorrow, sir.
[01:33:24.181 --> 01:33:24.801]  Godspeed.
[01:33:24.801 --> 01:33:25.221]  Thank you.
[01:33:25.221 --> 01:33:26.102]  There goes Larry Pratt.
[01:33:26.102 --> 01:33:29.522]  Okay, let's go to Matt Kazee.
[01:33:29.522 --> 01:33:32.003]  We'll have Jack Blood popping in briefly, too, if he can, in the next segment.
[01:33:32.003 --> 01:33:35.524]  Then we've got Aaron Zellman coming on, JPFO.org.
[01:33:35.524 --> 01:33:40.145]  Matt Kazee is a 9-11 truther, runs a powerful 9-11 truth website, lives on the campus.
[01:33:40.145 --> 01:33:42.206]  He's marched back down there, this time with a video camera.
[01:33:42.206 --> 01:33:45.427]  We've got some of the photos he sent us up on JonesReport.com right now.
[01:33:45.427 --> 01:33:46.387]  He's going to be sending us more.
[01:33:47.387 --> 01:33:50.228]  Matt, they're reporting 4G, CN, radio.
[01:33:50.228 --> 01:33:52.349]  What exactly are you seeing now?
[01:33:52.349 --> 01:33:54.810]  Well, actually, I haven't gotten all the way down there.
[01:33:54.810 --> 01:34:00.232]  I had to charge my camera, but what I do have is a timeline, and that is a very important thing with this.
[01:34:00.232 --> 01:34:06.054]  By 9 o'clock this morning, people who were getting to work on campus were immediately told what was going on.
[01:34:06.054 --> 01:34:13.877]  The alert email went out at 955, I believe, is when they sounded the alarm.
[01:34:13.877 --> 01:34:15.938]  Okay, an alert email at what time?
[01:34:19.667 --> 01:34:19.687]  955.
[01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:22.030]  955, and where are you getting this timeline?
[01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:26.255]  I've got a copy of the emails that were sent out across the campus.
[01:34:26.255 --> 01:34:30.600]  Do me a favor, send that immediately to erinandinfowars.com.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.782]  You are the best.
[01:34:32.782 --> 01:34:33.443]  No problem at all.
[01:34:34.342 --> 01:34:38.625]  All the most important thing that I found out was the bomb threats, Friday the 13th.
[01:34:38.625 --> 01:34:43.547]  The bomb threats were at Torgerson, Durham, and Whittemore Halls.
[01:34:43.547 --> 01:34:46.889]  There's always Satanism and Nazism tied into these.
[01:34:46.889 --> 01:34:52.792]  Columbine, the little ADL controlled, well he fits that M.O.
[01:34:52.792 --> 01:34:54.974]  Well, that was the fellow up in Minnesota.
[01:34:54.974 --> 01:34:55.654]  We've got a break.
[01:34:55.654 --> 01:34:57.475]  Stay there, we'll come right back to you.
[01:34:57.475 --> 01:34:59.256]  Then we've got Aaron Selman coming on.
[01:34:59.256 --> 01:35:00.657]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:03.661 --> 01:35:07.587]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:35:07.587 --> 01:35:10.271]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:15.771 --> 01:35:20.134]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:35:20.134 --> 01:35:22.155]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:35:22.155 --> 01:35:28.719]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:35:28.719 --> 01:35:35.103]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:35:35.103 --> 01:35:41.527]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with
[01:35:41.627 --> 01:35:47.972]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:35:47.972 --> 01:35:51.816]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:35:51.816 --> 01:35:55.699]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:35:55.699 --> 01:35:58.381]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:35:58.381 --> 01:35:59.422]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:36:00.202 --> 01:36:03.703]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:36:03.703 --> 01:36:06.404]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:36:06.404 --> 01:36:18.586]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming and the end of the world?
[01:36:18.586 --> 01:36:20.667]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[01:36:20.667 --> 01:36:23.888]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:36:23.888 --> 01:36:27.329]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:36:27.329 --> 01:36:29.169]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:36:29.449 --> 01:36:30.010]  We're good to go.
[01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:50.543]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[01:36:50.543 --> 01:36:55.126]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[01:36:55.126 --> 01:37:01.311]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[01:37:01.311 --> 01:37:03.952]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[01:37:03.952 --> 01:37:04.513]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:37:04.513 --> 01:37:05.553]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[01:37:13.459 --> 01:37:17.981]  Everyone knows we need calcium and magnesium every day for the support of strong bones.
[01:37:17.981 --> 01:37:22.844]  But most of us are only taking one source of calcium supplementation and one source of magnesium.
[01:37:22.844 --> 01:37:31.248]  That just simply isn't enough to give your body the proper nutrition it needs to help keep bones and teeth strong, prevent osteoporosis, and support muscle function.
[01:37:31.548 --> 01:37:36.350]  Now discover the most advanced calcium and magnesium supplement on the market today.

[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:35.623]  We're good to go.
[01:39:00.494 --> 01:39:04.769]  Strange days have found us.
[01:39:04.769 --> 01:39:05.732]  Strange days.
[01:39:06.764 --> 01:39:13.728]  All right, we're going to finish up with our man on the ground, who I want to give us a report at the very end of the show, again, if he can.
[01:39:13.728 --> 01:39:14.529]  He's about to march.
[01:39:14.529 --> 01:39:15.449]  He's right on campus.
[01:39:15.449 --> 01:39:17.730]  He went up there, and you heard the police told him, get back.
[01:39:17.730 --> 01:39:21.873]  He went hundreds of yards past the media, right up to the place where the shootings happened.
[01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:25.915]  He was trying to get more video and photos of the bullet holes and the damage.
[01:39:25.915 --> 01:39:30.258]  The cops are trying, obviously, to control their crime scene and not have that be seen.
[01:39:30.258 --> 01:39:31.478]  But he's not in the crime scene.
[01:39:31.478 --> 01:39:33.500]  He's up there trying to get documentation of it.
[01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:34.600]  He's going up there with another team.
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.200]  He's a known 9-11 truther.
[01:39:36.702 --> 01:39:38.885]  Uh, does a great job.
[01:39:38.885 --> 01:39:40.687]  And, uh, he's Matt Kazee.
[01:39:40.687 --> 01:39:44.031]  Then we've got Larry, well, we just had Larry Pratt on him, Gun Owners of America.
[01:39:44.031 --> 01:39:50.640]  Uh, Aaron Zellman of Jerusalem Preservation of Firearms ownership, who's already been all over this victim disarmament school.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:53.844]  Uh, he's here to let everybody know who is the real, uh,
[01:39:54.898 --> 01:40:01.064]  Accomplices to this, and it's the school, it's the system, it's the victim disarmament crowd who must be defeated, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:01.064 --> 01:40:11.773]  And we have the majority of Americans, we have the Constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we've been winning the fight, at least for the hearts and minds, but the government's been kind of going underground with its attack on the Second Amendment, and doing it covertly now, but more than ever.
[01:40:11.773 --> 01:40:13.375]  So to give us an update is Aaron Zellman.
[01:40:13.895 --> 01:40:15.797]  Of course, Jack Blood's got some new developments.
[01:40:15.797 --> 01:40:17.079]  Talk shows comes on right after me.
[01:40:17.079 --> 01:40:19.922]  He's going to be popping in here in just a second.
[01:40:19.922 --> 01:40:28.811]  But going back to Matt on the ground right now in Blacksburg, Virginia, as this unfolds.
[01:40:28.811 --> 01:40:30.773]  Matt, you've got the timeline.
[01:40:30.773 --> 01:40:32.115]  You have the internal school emails.
[01:40:32.415 --> 01:40:34.357]  Because you're part of the school there.
[01:40:34.357 --> 01:40:34.797]  You've got these.
[01:40:34.797 --> 01:40:37.019]  You're sending them right now to AaronInfoWars.com.
[01:40:37.019 --> 01:40:44.386]  We'll get those into the article that Paul Watson, Steve Watson, and Aaron Dykes, that works here, are all working together as a team on.
[01:40:44.386 --> 01:40:49.431]  Right now, they'll be out on PrisonPlanet.com, the definitive analysis of this, within the next hour.
[01:40:49.431 --> 01:40:50.852]  But please continue.
[01:40:50.852 --> 01:40:52.073]  You said you have the timeline.
[01:40:52.073 --> 01:40:58.219]  Can you read us that email, and then can you go through what you now know about some other things you were trying to say?
[01:40:59.188 --> 01:41:05.112]  Well Alex, to end the break, I've got my camera, what was charged up on it, I'm heading down there, I'm almost there right now.
[01:41:05.112 --> 01:41:07.454]  Were you able to send us the email first?
[01:41:07.454 --> 01:41:12.117]  I was not able to send the email, but I'm going to send that as soon as I walk through the door.
[01:41:12.117 --> 01:41:14.879]  Excellent job, okay.
[01:41:14.879 --> 01:41:16.720]  I'm right down here at the scene right now.
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:28.608]  What I did find out, it was that the bomb threats that had the second of the two last week, that happened on Friday the 13th, it happened at the buildings that were surrounding the building where the shooting was.
[01:41:29.631 --> 01:41:38.654]  Which I thought that was before early during the week, too.
[01:41:38.654 --> 01:41:43.956]  I'm actually walking to... It has cleaned out a lot since the last time I was down here.
[01:41:43.956 --> 01:41:50.419]  So just in roughly 40 minutes, you were down there and SWAT teams were coming out and they were still milling around.
[01:41:50.419 --> 01:41:51.719]  There were officers everywhere.
[01:41:51.719 --> 01:41:55.041]  What do you see there now at the main shooting area?
[01:41:55.041 --> 01:41:57.662]  Not half as many people standing outside.
[01:41:57.662 --> 01:41:58.702]  The vehicles are still here.
[01:41:59.415 --> 01:42:02.316]  I'm walking through it with my video camera right now.
[01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:06.778]  Now, have they hauled out the 32 dead bodies?
[01:42:06.778 --> 01:42:08.519]  Yes, they did.
[01:42:08.519 --> 01:42:10.339]  So they destroyed that crime scene.
[01:42:10.339 --> 01:42:16.542]  Well, they obviously tried to resuscitate some of them, but some of the people that were obviously dead shouldn't have been moved.
[01:42:16.542 --> 01:42:21.484]  Well, I'm not sure about all of the dead people, but I saw them removing a lot of people.
[01:42:21.484 --> 01:42:26.146]  There were some people, I'm getting pointed at because I've got a camera here that's telling me to get to the other side.
[01:42:30.579 --> 01:42:32.040]  Making famous right here.
[01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:35.881]  Anyway, it looks like they did pull out some dead.
[01:42:35.881 --> 01:42:39.723]  I saw some people with sheets over top of their heads when they were coming out.
[01:42:39.723 --> 01:42:46.266]  They took them to the local rescue squad and then various ambulances took them to the hospital and then they did bring in a couple of buses.
[01:42:46.266 --> 01:42:55.870]  Some of them did fill up a bus to some degree with wounded people.
[01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:56.150]  There are 17
[01:42:57.338 --> 01:42:59.362]  Well, I'll tell you what, Matt.
[01:42:59.362 --> 01:43:00.484]  You're multitasking.
[01:43:00.484 --> 01:43:03.429]  Keep the phone on, but just put it in your pocket.
[01:43:03.429 --> 01:43:06.654]  And then start trying to get some footage, because you're multitasking.
[01:43:06.654 --> 01:43:08.417]  And we're going to go back to you in about 10 minutes.
[01:43:08.417 --> 01:43:09.920]  Can you stay on the line, Matt?
[01:43:11.841 --> 01:43:12.702]  No problem.
[01:43:12.702 --> 01:43:14.563]  Okay, we're gonna come right back to you.
[01:43:14.563 --> 01:43:18.647]  Now, I gotta go to Aaron Zellman here quickly, but Jack Blood has been watching and tracking this.
[01:43:18.647 --> 01:43:24.872]  Within 20 minutes of this news breaking, he told me, and I hope we get tape of this, Fox News is already calling for gun control.
[01:43:24.872 --> 01:43:28.095]  The bastion of conservatism now backing Hillary.
[01:43:28.095 --> 01:43:31.397]  We broke it here first, three years ago, now been public the last year.
[01:43:31.397 --> 01:43:33.199]  They're really behind the Hillary campaign.
[01:43:33.199 --> 01:43:35.921]  Pure evil neocons.
[01:43:35.921 --> 01:43:37.002]  Jack Blood, what's going on there?
[01:43:38.012 --> 01:43:47.994]  Well, right now we've just got breaking news, Alex, that this is the work of an Asian man in his 20s, heavily armed, wearing a vest, looking for his girlfriend, according to Fox News.
[01:43:47.994 --> 01:43:59.796]  By the way, Fox News, the bastion of phony conservative news, 20 minutes after this story hit the wire, was already having their pundits on, calling for gun control.
[01:43:59.796 --> 01:44:01.677]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:44:01.677 --> 01:44:06.298]  And, you know, I think that one of the biggest things here is the two-hour time lapse at 8 a.m.
[01:44:07.626 --> 01:44:08.307]  I think so.
[01:44:28.746 --> 01:44:33.352]  She goes on, Alex, to say they had us under lockdown, they temporarily lifted the lockdown, and the gunmen shot again.
[01:44:33.352 --> 01:44:33.853]  They're also
[01:44:44.207 --> 01:44:51.097]  There have been some rumors, we're trying to substantiate, that the shooter could have some Muslim ties or could himself be Muslim.
[01:44:51.097 --> 01:44:59.630]  Well we saw the last guy who was Muslim from Central Asia shooting a bunch of people at a mall and that was shut down really quick.
[01:45:00.387 --> 01:45:02.629]  Alex, I have a ton of coverage on this.
[01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:06.571]  We're going to continue the coverage live on GCN, continually following the story.
[01:45:06.571 --> 01:45:14.496]  I invite your listeners to join us, to call into the program and to give us any analysis or any news that they have by monitoring the cable news outlets.
[01:45:14.496 --> 01:45:18.619]  We'll do that, Jack, and I'll call in as you're doing that if anything else develops that you don't catch.
[01:45:18.619 --> 01:45:19.300]  Thank you for the help.
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:19.700]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:20.040]  Great job.
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:20.720]  You bet.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:22.622]  I think we've got a big story coming out on this.
[01:45:22.622 --> 01:45:23.882]  Aaron Zellman.
[01:45:23.882 --> 01:45:34.529]  I meant to get into a bunch of big 9-11 developments today, and we'll do that before the show ends, but I appreciate you coming on on such short notice and holding during our eyewitness account, and then Jack has been covering things.
[01:45:34.529 --> 01:45:36.750]  It's JPFO.org.
[01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:37.471]  God bless you, sir.
[01:45:37.471 --> 01:45:38.592]  Thanks for being here.
[01:45:38.592 --> 01:45:39.112]  My pleasure.
[01:45:40.261 --> 01:45:42.502]  I notice, as usual, you're on top of things years before.
[01:45:42.502 --> 01:45:46.603]  You have attacked the head of this university for victim disarmament.
[01:45:46.603 --> 01:45:48.823]  You have said it's a disaster waiting to happen.
[01:45:48.823 --> 01:45:49.723]  You have written about it.
[01:45:49.723 --> 01:45:50.443]  You have covered it.
[01:45:50.443 --> 01:45:56.185]  You emailed us with a lot of documents and news articles back from 2005 when you were exposing this.
[01:45:56.185 --> 01:45:58.885]  So I guess here you tried to save some people.
[01:45:58.885 --> 01:46:06.367]  And would you say that the people that disarmed the victims there are at least accessories to manslaughter?
[01:46:07.715 --> 01:46:13.801]  The blood is definitely on their hands, and they really don't seem to care very much.
[01:46:13.801 --> 01:46:17.824]  They're going to find a way to whitewash it.
[01:46:17.824 --> 01:46:21.428]  That would not surprise me at all, if that happens.
[01:46:21.428 --> 01:46:27.633]  In the state of Virginia, you are allowed to get a concealed carry permit.
[01:46:27.633 --> 01:46:33.679]  So I'm assuming that the Virginia University said, well, students can't have guns on campus.
[01:46:35.292 --> 01:46:39.554]  Yes, I have a news article right here out of the Roanoke newspaper.
[01:46:39.554 --> 01:46:42.254]  Virginia Tech's ban on guns may draw legal fire.
[01:46:42.254 --> 01:46:48.817]  Some people question whether the university has the authority to ban the carrying of firearms.
[01:46:48.817 --> 01:46:49.757]  Well, there you go.
[01:46:49.757 --> 01:46:58.800]  So the blood is on the hands of everybody in the administration of that university, and I hope they get sued into oblivion.
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:04.442]  I hope their lives are destroyed for allowing someone to come in there and murder American students.
[01:47:06.258 --> 01:47:20.285]  I have no sympathy for anybody who works at a university administration level who thinks that they're an elitist, or who believes they are, who doesn't think that the little peons, the students, have a right to defend their life.
[01:47:20.285 --> 01:47:23.886]  These people should be put against a wall and executed.
[01:47:23.886 --> 01:47:28.889]  Well, that's what they certainly did by fiat to these students.
[01:47:28.889 --> 01:47:29.549]  Absolutely.
[01:47:29.549 --> 01:47:33.911]  And I think that this is a... I think that there's some other strange things about this.
[01:47:33.911 --> 01:47:35.292]  As you know, the Parker decision
[01:47:35.993 --> 01:47:36.953]  In Washington, D.C.
[01:47:36.953 --> 01:47:42.315]  had to do with people being able to have a gun in their home to defend their life.
[01:47:42.315 --> 01:47:46.596]  Notice how this is... Notice how this... I think we're on the same wavelength.
[01:47:46.596 --> 01:47:52.178]  But you see, there's also been calls in Congress for more gun control schemes.
[01:47:52.178 --> 01:47:53.018]  H.R.
[01:47:53.018 --> 01:47:56.879]  1022, oddly enough, is the name of the bill, the number of the bill.
[01:47:56.879 --> 01:48:04.942]  So all of a sudden you have people pushing gun control, you have people reacting to something favorable about gun ownership, and then you have this tragedy.
[01:48:05.502 --> 01:48:06.703]  It really smells to me.
[01:48:24.713 --> 01:48:26.414]  Well, I think that's my point.
[01:48:26.414 --> 01:48:33.456]  If you think about it, there was a situation similar to this in Canada not too long ago, and a couple years ago in Australia, which started a big push for gun control in Australia.
[01:48:33.456 --> 01:48:33.716]  Yeah, Tasmania.
[01:48:54.208 --> 01:49:01.530]  I, uh, this thing just smells to me, and I'm urging every gun owner to just dig their heels in and say, hell no.
[01:49:01.530 --> 01:49:03.431]  Hey, listen, we've got to get on the offensive.
[01:49:03.431 --> 01:49:05.411]  I agree, we've got to get on the offensive.
[01:49:05.411 --> 01:49:10.573]  Everyone, call every talk show today, and let's get the United Front Out headline.
[01:49:10.573 --> 01:49:14.354]  Everybody write your own emails, your own blogs, your own MySpaces.
[01:49:14.354 --> 01:49:19.996]  The people that had this be a zero-gun school, even after they'd had another
[01:49:20.496 --> 01:49:23.417]  I think that every one of your listeners has to make a commitment to themselves.
[01:49:23.417 --> 01:49:26.798]  Any politician who supports gun control schemes must have their career aborted.
[01:49:26.798 --> 01:49:27.758]  No ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[01:49:49.154 --> 01:49:53.457]  Aaron Zellman, continue with your analysis on what's happened here.
[01:49:53.457 --> 01:50:10.828]  Well, I think again, as we've been talking about, from what little I know, based on some of the information on the internet, that you have a situation where apparently an Asian student, that they claim he's Asian, went in there looking for his girlfriend, had some kind of personal issue going on.
[01:50:10.828 --> 01:50:16.131]  According to the article I read, he lined students up and systematically murdered them one at a time.
[01:50:17.402 --> 01:50:33.952]  So we have a situation here where, again, students were left defenseless because of the dictates of the people who run the school, and if justice is ever going to be done, the president of this university has to go to prison.
[01:50:34.649 --> 01:50:36.309]  Nothing less than that.
[01:50:36.309 --> 01:50:48.131]  Would you put your son or daughter, and this isn't just a question for Aaron, but I want him to answer it, in a place where you know it's a target of nut balls or government ops or anything else, where you knew they couldn't defend themselves?
[01:50:48.131 --> 01:50:49.692]  No, I would not.
[01:50:49.692 --> 01:50:51.112]  There is a problem here, though.
[01:50:51.112 --> 01:50:55.313]  There's a lot of university campuses that don't allow students to carry weapons.
[01:50:55.313 --> 01:50:56.573]  No, I know.
[01:50:56.573 --> 01:51:00.274]  And so, you know, we're putting a rock in a hard place.
[01:51:00.274 --> 01:51:01.794]  If you want your kid to go to college,
[01:51:02.688 --> 01:51:02.868]  I don't
[01:51:25.686 --> 01:51:27.688]  You smell a giant stinking rat.
[01:51:27.688 --> 01:51:28.829]  You think this is suspicious?
[01:51:28.829 --> 01:51:29.970]  It's always perfect.
[01:51:29.970 --> 01:51:33.672]  Even Rush Limbaugh said years ago, I heard him, you know, it's always perfect timing, right?
[01:51:33.672 --> 01:51:36.615]  When they get ready for a new gun push, there'll be a string.
[01:51:36.615 --> 01:51:39.017]  There'll probably be a bunch of copycats now.
[01:51:39.017 --> 01:51:40.077]  Oh, I have no doubt about it.
[01:51:40.077 --> 01:51:41.899]  You know, I think this thing really stinks.
[01:51:41.899 --> 01:51:54.669]  I think the Parker decision really got them going because if you listen to what the gun haters have been saying, they're in shock that somehow the government's going to recognize
[01:51:55.473 --> 01:51:58.556]  That gun ownership is an individual right, not a collective right.
[01:51:58.556 --> 01:52:13.089]  Well, Aaron, real conservatives, I don't mean the fake George Bush conservative listeners, but real conservative issues of Second Amendment, border control, anti-abortion, pro-life, we're in polls gaining feet every day.
[01:52:13.089 --> 01:52:18.074]  And now that doesn't mean the government's moving, but they see us moving, and yeah, they're panicking, Aaron.
[01:52:18.074 --> 01:52:18.814]  Absolutely.
[01:52:18.814 --> 01:52:21.597]  I think you're going to see more situations like this.
[01:52:22.486 --> 01:52:26.429]  And so I'm telling people, dig your heels in, get prepared.
[01:52:26.429 --> 01:52:28.030]  Things are going to get dicey.
[01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:39.399]  Remember Alex, a couple years ago I told you, you laughed at me, but I said don't be surprised if there are not elections, presidential elections.
[01:52:39.399 --> 01:52:40.680]  Let's just see what happens.
[01:52:42.180 --> 01:52:44.082]  Put it on the back burner and let it simmer.
[01:52:44.082 --> 01:52:44.862]  No, I wasn't lying.
[01:52:44.862 --> 01:52:46.344]  That might have been another host.
[01:52:46.344 --> 01:52:47.044]  All right, okay.
[01:52:47.044 --> 01:52:49.126]  Aaron, you might have... I mean, I know you were... Are you kidding?
[01:52:49.126 --> 01:52:52.248]  I write articles about how Ron Paul said on the show last week.
[01:52:52.248 --> 01:52:54.971]  Ron Paul said they're gearing up for martial law right now.
[01:52:54.971 --> 01:52:55.371]  Of course.
[01:52:55.371 --> 01:52:58.093]  So I wouldn't plan on elections.
[01:52:58.093 --> 01:53:02.176]  I think all this is just bread and circuses.
[01:53:02.176 --> 01:53:05.099]  What, you think it's just going to crescendo and build?
[01:53:05.099 --> 01:53:07.441]  Well, if they can make it happen.
[01:53:07.441 --> 01:53:09.863]  That's why the... I think your listeners have got to get ready.
[01:53:09.863 --> 01:53:11.564]  They've got to have their wits about them.
[01:53:12.532 --> 01:53:13.653]  Well, everybody feels it.
[01:53:13.653 --> 01:53:20.295]  I mean, all the old-timers talked about the New World Order building up, but now we see all the things they talk about happening, brother.
[01:53:20.295 --> 01:53:22.376]  Well, I think it's more than just the New World Order.
[01:53:22.376 --> 01:53:29.699]  I think it's really a matter of people have just become too comfortable with the government.
[01:53:29.699 --> 01:53:31.780]  I was reading an article this morning.
[01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:38.683]  52% of the people in the United States have money coming from the government, federal government, one way or another.
[01:53:40.342 --> 01:53:42.503]  Fifty-two percent of the American people.
[01:53:42.503 --> 01:53:45.325]  Yeah, I don't have a red cent coming from them.
[01:53:45.325 --> 01:53:52.989]  So, they're also including people on Social Security and things of that nature, or dependents.
[01:53:52.989 --> 01:53:57.712]  So, 52% of the American people have got a warm, fuzzy feeling about the government.
[01:53:57.712 --> 01:54:01.755]  And another 10% are in the criminal justice system, so they've got us one way or another.
[01:54:01.755 --> 01:54:04.877]  Aaron Zellman, give us the website.
[01:54:04.877 --> 01:54:05.937]  JPFO.org.
[01:54:07.819 --> 01:54:12.123]  You'll learn more about our efforts to destroy the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
[01:54:12.123 --> 01:54:14.925]  And that's going to be important with this new push for gun control.
[01:54:14.925 --> 01:54:21.470]  Well, listen, I want to get you up for a full hour in the next few days, so let my producer call you so we can really walk through this, so we can take some calls as well.
[01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:23.832]  Aaron Zellman, thank you for spending time with us.
[01:54:23.832 --> 01:54:24.693]  My pleasure, Alex.
[01:54:24.693 --> 01:54:25.373]  Be well.
[01:54:25.373 --> 01:54:26.134]  You better take care.
[01:54:26.134 --> 01:54:29.276]  Well, there's Aaron Zellman thinking it's probably an inside job.
[01:54:29.276 --> 01:54:32.899]  And Larry Pratt said there's some things that are suspicious as well.
[01:54:32.899 --> 01:54:34.921]  And drills and all these things.
[01:54:34.921 --> 01:54:35.561]  I mean, this thing...
[01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:41.731]  I think you're going to find out this guy was under psychiatric care.
[01:54:41.731 --> 01:54:47.072]  You're going to find out, and God, if he is a Muslim, folks, that's the kickoff.
[01:54:47.072 --> 01:54:51.173]  And there's a slight chance it could just be a nut or a real Muslim terrorist.
[01:54:51.173 --> 01:54:53.554]  There are real things that happen that aren't the government.
[01:54:53.554 --> 01:54:54.594]  There are few and far between.
[01:54:54.594 --> 01:54:58.595]  And I've said, real terrorist attacks do look like this.
[01:54:58.595 --> 01:55:03.376]  Where somebody goes in and stabs 15 people or shoots 45 people.
[01:55:03.376 --> 01:55:06.157]  And I've told you, of the four types of terrorism,
[01:55:06.843 --> 01:55:08.903]  There's really three, but there's one subset.
[01:55:08.903 --> 01:55:12.004]  There's one form that's real organic, and then this could be that.
[01:55:12.004 --> 01:55:15.265]  But it sounds like a guy throwing a fit with his girlfriend.
[01:55:15.265 --> 01:55:24.987]  But in all the other cases, they're on drugs, they're in psychiatric care, their parents are feds, they've been at weird bases, or they were military troops in weird mind-control programs.
[01:55:24.987 --> 01:55:29.708]  Remember the guy, Larry Ashbrook?
[01:55:29.708 --> 01:55:31.208]  I'm going from memory on that.
[01:55:31.208 --> 01:55:31.328]  In 1998,
[01:55:34.375 --> 01:55:37.256]  There's a 99 in Fort Worth, and it was 98.
[01:55:37.256 --> 01:55:40.797]  Went in, and he shot a bunch of people.
[01:55:40.797 --> 01:55:42.257]  And he'd been calling the police department.
[01:55:42.257 --> 01:55:42.917]  He'd been in the Navy.
[01:55:42.917 --> 01:55:44.517]  He'd been in secret operations.
[01:55:44.517 --> 01:55:48.498]  He got out, and he would, like, go right to the editor and go, look, I'm under mind control.
[01:55:48.498 --> 01:55:49.679]  I'm not schizophrenic.
[01:55:49.679 --> 01:55:52.299]  And the neighbors saw guys dragging him and put him in a van.
[01:55:52.299 --> 01:55:55.420]  I mean, it wasn't just that he was a lot of schizophrenics out there.
[01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:58.261]  He really was under their control.
[01:55:58.261 --> 01:55:59.521]  He went to Baptist Church.
[01:56:00.393 --> 01:56:03.119]  And he lined them up and they just groveled.
[01:56:03.119 --> 01:56:05.344]  And he said, you know, do you believe in Jesus?
[01:56:05.344 --> 01:56:05.705]  Yes.
[01:56:05.705 --> 01:56:06.386]  Boom.
[01:56:06.386 --> 01:56:08.591]  Same thing with the Columbine deal.
[01:56:08.591 --> 01:56:10.576]  The mind control involves Satanism.
[01:56:16.872 --> 01:56:22.682]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:56:22.682 --> 01:56:30.335]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:38.473]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:56:38.473 --> 01:56:50.198]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:56:50.198 --> 01:56:54.180]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:56.441]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:56:56.441 --> 01:57:00.283]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:57:13.809 --> 01:57:18.612]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:57:18.612 --> 01:57:23.235]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[01:57:23.235 --> 01:57:37.243]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey Light Water Purifier, an LED Base, two Berkey Sport Filtration Bottles, the Berkey Battery Adapter, the Berkey MP Solar Charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:57:37.483 --> 01:57:54.460]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones.
[01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:55.260]  We're good to go.
[01:58:13.883 --> 01:58:15.825]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:58:15.825 --> 01:58:19.848]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:58:19.848 --> 01:58:28.936]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:58:28.936 --> 01:58:34.041]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[01:58:34.041 --> 01:58:35.722]  Every time you walk away from your computer,
[01:58:35.802 --> 01:58:36.203]  We're good.
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:53.301]  Well, the Rosie O'Donnell
[01:59:19.071 --> 01:59:24.733]  Breaking inside report we put out about what she's planning to do, having first responders on with the dust, and talk about 9-11 later.
[01:59:24.733 --> 01:59:29.035]  Would have been a huge report today, and it's still going to be big.
[01:59:29.035 --> 01:59:34.116]  Make sure that we don't stop talking about Alberto Gonzalez and the firing gate and all the crimes he's involved in.
[01:59:34.116 --> 01:59:36.977]  Make sure we don't stop talking about how they want to go into Iran.
[01:59:36.977 --> 01:59:44.800]  Make sure we continue to push 9-11 truth, no matter how many mass shootings the feds orchestrate, no matter how many copycats that causes.
[01:59:46.454 --> 01:59:48.275]  We're going to expose this mass shooting thing as well.
[01:59:48.275 --> 02:00:01.481]  We're going to have the definitive report, that is the definitive preliminary of such a thing, on mass shootings and the past staged events with all the questions surrounding this out very soon on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.net.
[02:00:01.481 --> 02:00:05.803]  So watch that space, watch that channel, and help us get that out.
[02:00:05.803 --> 02:00:08.305]  You, the listeners, are the reason we're having an effect.
[02:00:08.305 --> 02:00:10.586]  You, the listeners, are the reason we're able to reach people.
[02:00:10.586 --> 02:00:12.647]  But Rosie prepares to strike back for 9-11 truth.
[02:00:13.957 --> 02:00:20.420]  Insider scoop, Ground Zero heroes impacted by toxic dust cover up to appear on The View tomorrow, their schedule.
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:21.581]  We'll see if that happens.
[02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:32.526]  A headline on the Drudge Report today reads, Rosie no more, impeach Bush talk on The View, because she said on there that she'll just be screaming inside for now on her site, but that's not really what we've got.
[02:00:32.526 --> 02:00:33.327]  We've got the inside.
[02:00:33.327 --> 02:00:33.787]  We've talked to her.
[02:00:33.787 --> 02:00:34.547]  We've got the email.
[02:00:34.547 --> 02:00:36.088]  We've got her inside people as well.
[02:00:37.865 --> 02:00:45.069]  And it goes on to say, we know that these other things include government's criminal cover-up of the Ground Zero toxic dust scandal, killing 9-11 heroes.
[02:00:45.069 --> 02:00:56.556]  Rosie is reportedly sick and tired of the very parties who covered up the toxic dust scandal, then claiming the mantle of 9-11 victims in order to smear anyone who asked questions about the events of that day.
[02:00:56.556 --> 02:00:59.538]  O'Donnell is aware of the fact that the majority
[02:01:00.274 --> 02:01:04.738]  of the victim's family members now believe there is an ongoing cover-up surrounding 9-11.
[02:01:04.738 --> 02:01:12.564]  As a result, several Ground Zero first responders are to be interviewed on The View with the first being broadcast on Tuesday morning.
[02:01:12.564 --> 02:01:21.351]  This is the beginning of a carefully planned course of attack to counter the threats and censorship being employed by neocon talking heads to stifle 9-11 truth.
[02:01:21.351 --> 02:01:23.733]  There's also somebody inside the system stifling her
[02:01:25.121 --> 02:01:26.423]  Uh, and it goes on.
[02:01:26.423 --> 02:01:32.150]  This information comes from multiple sources within O'Donnell's inner circle, as well as a prominent member of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:01:32.150 --> 02:01:44.584]  O'Donnell should be applauded once again for having the courage to stand up for the truth in the face of the orchestrated establishment witch hunt, as well as the neocon producer at ABC who is acting as a gatekeeper in trying to prevent the information from being broadcast.
[02:01:45.717 --> 02:01:48.642]  This is all inside stuff you're getting, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:48.642 --> 02:02:00.281]  This is an overwhelming slap in the face to the establishment media bullies who thought that their attempts to incriminate and intimidation and chilling free speech could shut Rosie up and prevent 9-11 from, uh, cover up from enjoying maximum exposure.
[02:02:01.514 --> 02:02:15.564]  And it goes on to how she really woke up, when she woke up, what film made her wake up, how delays attacking her, and then we get into the latest 9-11 hoax out of Pravda claiming that Imus was fired because of you going public about 9-11 truth.
[02:02:15.564 --> 02:02:22.449]  The details of that, the inside scoop on what really happened there is up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[02:02:22.449 --> 02:02:27.433]  Now I've done two hours and 57 minutes 12 seconds and I haven't plugged videos yet.
[02:02:27.433 --> 02:02:30.375]  That's how we fund the operation here, plus they're incredibly good films.
[02:02:31.358 --> 02:02:38.505]  We carry America, freedom to fascism, loose change, second edition, 9-11 mysteries, demolitions, my film Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:02:38.505 --> 02:02:43.749]  Get the high-quality DVDs and support the researchers and filmmakers that have made these films.
[02:02:43.749 --> 02:02:45.571]  Support us, InfoWars.com.
[02:02:46.756 --> 02:02:52.903]  Safe, secure online shopping cart for videos and books and t-shirts and much more.
[02:02:52.903 --> 02:03:02.294]  By the way, the TV star of that FX show, Daniel Sanjata, went on the big red carpet at a big premiere wearing one of our 9-11 inside job t-shirts.
[02:03:02.294 --> 02:03:03.716]  That's up on Infowars.net.
[02:03:03.716 --> 02:03:04.217]  That was great.
[02:03:04.857 --> 02:03:15.388]  Uh, so get some of those while you're at it, and get the word out, because they're gonna use terrorism, they're gonna use mass shootings that they create, they provocateur, that they misrepresent with victims they've disarmed.
[02:03:15.388 --> 02:03:16.509]  Either way, the government did this.
[02:03:16.509 --> 02:03:22.135]  The government disarmed the people so they couldn't defend themselves, and it looks like the government's involved in this, if they've ever been involved.
[02:03:22.683 --> 02:03:24.844]  And, uh, it's just amazing.
[02:03:24.844 --> 02:03:26.084]  So, InfoWars.com.
[02:03:26.084 --> 02:03:26.684]  Get the films.
[02:03:26.684 --> 02:03:27.164]  Get them out.
[02:03:27.164 --> 02:03:27.684]  Make copies.
[02:03:27.684 --> 02:03:28.345]  Never stop.
[02:03:28.345 --> 02:03:33.366]  Don't forget the free podcast of the three-hour show you can subscribe to at InfoWars.com.
[02:03:33.366 --> 02:03:34.946]  Be sure and spread the word on that as well.
[02:03:34.946 --> 02:03:39.628]  And get our story on Rosie striking back and the big story we've got on this shooting.
[02:03:39.628 --> 02:03:40.668]  And get it out to everybody.
[02:03:40.668 --> 02:03:42.749]  The alternative media must grow, and it is.
[02:03:42.749 --> 02:03:44.749]  We must surge and defeat the New World Order.
[02:03:44.749 --> 02:03:47.750]  To my crew, to everybody here at the office, great job.
[02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:50.791]  Now, we'll see you back tomorrow live and back continually here on the network.
[02:03:50.791 --> 02:03:51.151]  God bless.
