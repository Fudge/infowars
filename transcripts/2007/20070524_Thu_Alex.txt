[00:00:05.446 --> 00:00:06.106]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.747 --> 00:00:07.807]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:09.807]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:11.107]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:12.768]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.428 --> 00:00:17.369]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.749]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.150]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.211]  It's already Thursday.
[00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:30.491]  These weeks are going by like minutes now.
[00:00:32.014 --> 00:00:36.735]  It used to be a week was a week, then it felt like a day, then an hour, then a minute, next a second.
[00:00:37.896 --> 00:00:41.416]  It is Thursday, the 24th day of May 2007.
[00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:56.100]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours in defense of our constitutional republic and in defense of human liberty worldwide for all of our listeners across the planet and the seven seas.
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.921]  Welcome to this transmission against tyranny.
[00:01:00.137 --> 00:01:03.218]  We've got Ron Paul scheduled to join us next Tuesday.
[00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:14.863]  Today, the presidential candidate, today we have his campaign chairman, campaign director, Kent Snyder is scheduled to be joining us a little bit later today.
[00:01:15.243 --> 00:01:16.884]  And so is Greg Powell.
[00:01:16.904 --> 00:01:27.228]  Let's talk about a host of global issues from oil prices to the war in Iraq, the BBC slash ABC News slash best-selling author.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.886]  of armed Madhouse and the best democracy money can buy is scheduled to join us an hour and a half from now.
[00:01:36.686 --> 00:01:38.148]  We will have open phones.
[00:01:38.168 --> 00:01:43.792]  There are so many news stories, so many issues, so many things happening.
[00:01:43.832 --> 00:01:52.359]  Whatever subject you want to talk about, whatever news piece you want to talk about, you agree with me about something, you have a question, a comment, you disagree, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:58.306 --> 00:02:04.071]  President Bush has announced that he's a dictator, but frankly everyone's missing the boat on this yet again.
[00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:17.542]  They declare an emergency every year, they've been doing it since 1933, and so he can act as a dictator now, not once an emergency is declared.
[00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:29.579]  And this is the first time that we've had public declarations of this, and the first time they've actually funded the military to carry it out physically on a mass scale.
[00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:48.674]  I mean, I heard Jerome Corsi last night, God bless him, Dr. Corsi, on Coast to Coast AM, I was turning the radio on here at the office about 12.45 at night just to see what was on, and sure enough there he was talking about Bush now having these martial law powers, and he's correct, but it's much worse than that.
[00:02:49.793 --> 00:02:55.215]  I rarely lobby to get on Coast to Coast AM, but I think I'm going to call George Norrip today and say, I need to come on your show.
[00:02:55.235 --> 00:02:58.697]  I need to go over the full import of this.
[00:02:59.097 --> 00:03:05.259]  Paul Watson wrote a great story yesterday about it, containing some of the info, but it's such a big subject, we may do a part two on that.
[00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:08.401]  I mean, he is announcing himself to be a dictator.
[00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:12.024]  So I would love to hear from you on that subject at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:29.906 --> 00:03:37.633]  1-800-259-9231, and we will get you up and on the air.
[00:03:38.193 --> 00:03:45.900]  The websites, of course, are PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, Infowars.net, JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:54.487]  For those that aren't on the Internet, or those that will spend a lot of time on it, you're probably tired of me talking about Digg.com, D-I-G-G.com.
[00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:57.553]  But it's hundreds of times bigger than Drugs Report.
[00:03:57.993 --> 00:04:01.275]  We can reach millions of new people by getting on their main page.
[00:04:01.455 --> 00:04:07.259]  And here, they claim it's a digital democracy where if people vote a story up, it goes to the main page.
[00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:13.483]  Dig five months ago admittedly, in January, put out a release saying they were censoring Prison Planet.
[00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.250]  We're good to go.
[00:04:35.764 --> 00:04:46.611]  I mean, they've all, I printed it out here, they've got Ron Paul's picture and the 20-something candidates in both parties, and they just call him spammer and say they don't even allow you to vote for him.
[00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:48.152]  It's the same thing with us.
[00:04:48.192 --> 00:04:55.257]  They just say arbitrarily, no, you don't count, it's all made up, you're just a fad, you're banned.
[00:04:55.277 --> 00:04:58.159]  So I want to talk about that to some when we get back.
[00:05:04.281 --> 00:05:09.767]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.128 --> 00:05:17.756]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.453 --> 00:05:25.516]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.896 --> 00:05:37.341]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:41.563]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.603 --> 00:05:43.524]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.864 --> 00:05:47.726]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.943 --> 00:06:11.008]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.248 --> 00:06:22.474]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.814 --> 00:06:28.517]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:28.677 --> 00:06:29.257]  I don't know.
[00:06:46.727 --> 00:06:49.389]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer!
[00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:51.290]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[00:07:08.892 --> 00:07:09.993]  For a while, anyway.
[00:07:10.534 --> 00:07:13.696]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[00:07:14.317 --> 00:07:16.659]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:20.462]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[00:07:20.803 --> 00:07:23.085]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:24.366]  What's the name again?
[00:07:24.726 --> 00:07:25.727]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[00:07:26.127 --> 00:07:26.928]  It's CalX.
[00:07:26.948 --> 00:07:27.429]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[00:07:29.776 --> 00:07:31.456]  What makes Cal-X ointment so different?
[00:07:31.656 --> 00:07:39.978]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[00:07:41.018 --> 00:07:45.579]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:54.901]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:56.722]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[00:07:56.762 --> 00:07:57.442]  I'll be right back.
[00:07:57.682 --> 00:07:58.622]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:05.897]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:08.538]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:24.913 --> 00:08:32.539]  Greg Palast is joining us later as well as the campaign director of Congressman Ron Paul's presidential campaign.
[00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:39.184]  Again, the congressman is scheduled to join us from Texas coming up next Tuesday after the holiday.
[00:08:41.866 --> 00:08:43.947]  Let me just jump into the news right now.
[00:08:44.007 --> 00:08:45.729]  We'll also have open phones today at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:50.828 --> 00:08:58.231]  Remember back in 2002, I've got to dig up those radio shows, because I probably said it 300, 400, 500 times.
[00:08:58.251 --> 00:09:03.874]  I mean, I know it's got to be over 300 times, because as they built up for the war in 2001, 2002, 2003, I said every day, pretty much, what was going to happen.
[00:09:03.954 --> 00:09:05.315]  That our government was going to go into Iraq
[00:09:17.541 --> 00:09:35.109]  Build permanent bases, break the country in three parts, and then bring in international I4, UN, and NATO troops after, I predicted, five years, and quote, declaring that we had failed and that we couldn't do it, and then handing it over to the UN as the saviors.
[00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.791]  Now, I'm not tooting my horn.
[00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:43.913]  It's that when I talk about something, I want people to really pay attention.
[00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:47.564]  It's like martial law and Bush being a dictator.
[00:09:48.365 --> 00:09:57.374]  We've been talking about this ever since I got on the radio, ever since I got on air 13 years ago, not because I'm even that smart, but because I have the government documents.
[00:09:57.994 --> 00:10:00.797]  I happen to have stumbled into what was going on.
[00:10:01.558 --> 00:10:07.343]  I happen to have already been a history buff to some extent and knew what governments had done in the past, so I already knew what to look for.
[00:10:07.804 --> 00:10:08.765]  And we're in deep trouble.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:18.784]  And frankly, it makes my head spin sometimes that Jerome Corsi can suddenly just pop up and announce that the President's now a dictator and it's massive international news.
[00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:26.648]  Maybe people are just ready now to believe the truth, but I've got a lot of other knowledge about this that people need to know.
[00:10:26.928 --> 00:10:28.229]  It's frankly much worse.
[00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.211]  And it's admittedly much worse.
[00:10:34.346 --> 00:10:46.091]  But we should be glad that people like Jerome Corsi, who just a year or two ago was saying basically nuke the whole Middle East, turn it into a parking lot, and the greatest threat in the world is Islamist jihadists, is now saying the big threat is martial law and the New World Order.
[00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:53.574]  And I think he genuinely has woken up, and he's even said on this show that he's looking at 9-11 now as being an inside job.
[00:10:54.015 --> 00:11:01.218]  I mean, if we could convert people like Jerome Corsi and people like Bruce Willis
[00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:03.709]  Which has now happened, by the way.
[00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:06.270]  It shows that we're having a major effect.
[00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.372]  The truth is cutting through the propaganda.
[00:11:09.972 --> 00:11:11.293]  It is cutting the brainwashing.
[00:11:11.353 --> 00:11:27.041]  But when I get up here and I tell you what the plan is for Iraq, it's because I have the Israeli 83 plan, I have the Pentagon 2000 plan, and 2002 plan, and I'm just reading off what they're saying they're going to do.
[00:11:31.567 --> 00:11:33.228]  I mean, there was never any debate.
[00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.850]  It was all stated.
[00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.812]  Let me explain something to Neocon listeners that are tuning in freaked out right now.
[00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:50.695]  This is all public.
[00:11:54.156 --> 00:12:01.299]  And I know that you want to have a simple life and you want to have everything black and white and you want to
[00:12:01.963 --> 00:12:03.864]  I think that we're the good guys and they're the bad guys.
[00:12:03.884 --> 00:12:04.844]  Let me give you a news flash.
[00:12:05.365 --> 00:12:08.026]  The Saudi Arabians are totally degenerate and evil.
[00:12:09.046 --> 00:12:10.367]  We're degenerate and evil.
[00:12:10.387 --> 00:12:12.548]  That is our government, our leaders, our owners.
[00:12:13.068 --> 00:12:15.069]  The Israelis are unbelievably corrupt.
[00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:17.750]  The Russians are unbelievably corrupt and wicked.
[00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.891]  The British are unbelievably wicked.
[00:12:20.651 --> 00:12:23.773]  The Germans are involved in every form of wickedness you can imagine.
[00:12:24.073 --> 00:12:25.233]  The Japanese are.
[00:12:25.554 --> 00:12:27.374]  The Chinese probably take the cake.
[00:12:27.775 --> 00:12:30.676]  The Mexicans are unbelievably corrupt and backward.
[00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:37.898]  It's all bad, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to the people in high places.
[00:12:37.918 --> 00:12:39.119]  That's what the Bible tells you.
[00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:41.159]  And surprise, surprise, it's right.
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.540]  And so our problem is government.
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.221]  And our problem is that wicked people always get in positions of power.
[00:12:50.641 --> 00:12:55.462]  So the Founding Fathers' solution, the Founding Fathers' answer,
[00:12:56.394 --> 00:13:07.018]  to that, was to limit the size of government, and to limit the size of its mechanisms, and limit the size of its arms, so it couldn't do a lot of damage.
[00:13:09.579 --> 00:13:25.846]  I mean, I'm standing on the shoulders of Greek philosophers, and our founding fathers, and English statesmen, and French philosophers and historians, and Italian, you know, Genoan
[00:13:28.047 --> 00:13:30.328]  political masterminds like Machiavelli.
[00:13:30.408 --> 00:13:34.870]  I've just studied what they said, and lo and behold, they were right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:36.971]  And so I know exactly how things work.
[00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:39.052]  I know exactly what the New World Order is going to do.
[00:13:39.312 --> 00:13:41.733]  It's all right there, like an open book to me.
[00:13:42.133 --> 00:13:47.316]  And I look at the general public stumbling around, being caught in all these snares, not knowing what's going on.
[00:13:47.336 --> 00:13:54.959]  I mean, literally, it's like you're blind, you're deaf, you don't know how to read the language written directly on the wall in front of you.
[00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:58.402]  And that's what blows me away each and every day!
[00:13:59.203 --> 00:14:00.744]  Is that I'm not that smart!
[00:14:01.005 --> 00:14:02.166]  And this stuff's easy!
[00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:12.368]  I mean, you can get into all the fine minutiae of how they're doing and how they operate and the complexities of their governmental command structure, and that is complex.
[00:14:12.428 --> 00:14:15.249]  But just to understand, the government's completely corrupt.
[00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:16.810]  You can't believe a thing they say.
[00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.231]  They're totally evil.
[00:14:18.451 --> 00:14:22.833]  They commit more crimes than all civilians, as they call us, combined.
[00:14:23.413 --> 00:14:28.496]  And it's all now going pell-mell, helter-skelter, over the edge of the cliff right now.
[00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:32.578]  In the scheme of historical developments,
[00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:40.950]  Let's say the country is a runaway train in 1913, the private banks take over.
[00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:56.025]  And it's a runaway freight train going 100 miles an hour through mountain passes, and it's rocking on the rails, it can fly off at any moment, and it just speeds up, and speeds up, and speeds up, and we can't believe that it's still staying on the tracks, but we left the tracks
[00:14:57.418 --> 00:15:03.584]  A couple years ago, but in the scheme of time, that's only a few milliseconds, and we are now going off the edge of the cliff.
[00:15:04.044 --> 00:15:14.894]  The locomotive and the cars behind it and the cabooses already left the cliff, and we are just flying out over the Rocky Mountains, down 2,000 feet in the bottom of a gorge.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.841]  I mean, that's where we're at right now.
[00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:31.987]  And I'm sitting here with, you know, my stomach in my throat, you know, when you drive over a big hill or you bungee jump or whatever, you know, you feel like that, you know, that pit of your stomach's up in your throat.
[00:15:32.007 --> 00:15:36.369]  I mean, I'm sitting here looking at this going, oh my God, brace for impact.
[00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:41.632]  The general public's busy putting makeup on or applying stylish clothes or
[00:15:42.409 --> 00:15:46.852]  You know, going around partying, and I'm not saying you shouldn't do some of that, but you gotta get balanced here.
[00:15:47.412 --> 00:15:50.134]  I mean, you spend all your time doing that instead of even being informed.
[00:15:50.414 --> 00:15:51.695]  Don't you want to be informed?
[00:15:51.895 --> 00:15:53.476]  Don't you want to know what's going on in the world?
[00:15:53.656 --> 00:15:55.057]  Don't you want to understand things?
[00:15:55.718 --> 00:15:58.880]  Don't you want to be empowered and in the driver's seat in your own life?
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:05.264]  Or do you just like being fooled by the fake Republicans and the fake Democrats who are on the same team?
[00:16:08.206 --> 00:16:10.047]  Let me just run through the news I've got in front of me.
[00:16:11.076 --> 00:16:12.839]  Bush may turn to U.N.
[00:16:12.919 --> 00:16:14.782]  in search for Iraq solution.
[00:16:15.363 --> 00:16:19.248]  If troop surge fails, strategy is to involve other nations under U.N.
[00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.709]  umbrella.
[00:16:20.731 --> 00:16:23.855]  Now, what did I say probably 500 times?
[00:16:25.521 --> 00:16:32.306]  In fact, listeners, I know there's millions of you, and you've got recordings of my old shows, and you've... I don't have the stat to do this.
[00:16:32.847 --> 00:16:37.750]  Will you please go back to 2002-2003 on the... The best way to do it is just the eve of the war.
[00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.371]  In fact, I could do this.
[00:16:39.491 --> 00:16:41.453]  We could just go to the day before we attacked,
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:47.503]  The day we attacked, and when I say we, the globalists, I don't get out of their mind control either.
[00:16:47.523 --> 00:16:50.645]  We always say, we, we, we, we're attacking, we're doing this, we're doing that.
[00:16:50.945 --> 00:16:55.348]  No, we're being drug around like a pimp drags a whore by the hair when she isn't behaving.
[00:16:56.809 --> 00:16:57.189]  Okay?
[00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:11.157]  And actually, we can just go find the archives, I know the network's probably still got them, I know they're all over the web, of mid-March 2003, and you can just... I was screaming, this is what's gonna happen.
[00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.970]  We're going to go in.
[00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:16.912]  I just did it again.
[00:17:17.032 --> 00:17:25.536]  The globalists using us as their muscle, while they blow out our economy and run up our debts, are going to use us as their Hessian mercs, mercenaries.
[00:17:26.491 --> 00:17:44.172]  To go in, take over, break the country in three parts, build permanent bases, then we will be seen as occupiers, the foreign press owned by the New World Order, owned by Murdoch, he attacks us overseas where he's got even bigger media holdings, we'll be demonized, we'll be bad mouthed, we'll be the bad guys.
[00:17:45.073 --> 00:18:06.660]  And then after four to ten years, I said, I don't know because they don't specifically say, but I said within a period of time we'll be globally discredited, the EU will be the new savior as the new central system of the UN, and suddenly the euro will rise at that very same time, our economy will go into third world-dom, and a UN force will go into Iraq,
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.741]  And the UN force will then be seen as the liberators.
[00:18:10.581 --> 00:18:18.003]  And I said our own government, our military, Mossad and MI6 will then stop staging terror attacks.
[00:18:18.303 --> 00:18:19.884]  This is before we invaded, by the way.
[00:18:20.784 --> 00:18:27.406]  I mean, I do deserve just a little bit of respect because I'm able to take all their documents and fuse it and figure out what they're going to do.
[00:18:27.766 --> 00:18:30.247]  Because some of it wasn't tacitly stated.
[00:18:31.707 --> 00:18:34.328]  And then they will stir up a strategy of tension
[00:18:35.049 --> 00:18:35.850]  Actually, it was stated.
[00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:41.096]  P-2-O-G Pentagon plan to stimulate terror attacks and then they're going to remove that.
[00:18:41.376 --> 00:18:44.840]  They can turn it off like a spigot, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:48.104]  They can reduce it by 95% by snapping their fingers.
[00:18:48.504 --> 00:18:56.333]  See, we couldn't just go in and turn the lights on, get the water going and leave because of the hundreds of billions every few months in no-bid weapons contracts and
[00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.150]  All the rest of it.
[00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.531]  You know, it's also a big profit center.
[00:18:59.991 --> 00:19:01.651]  And then we're discredited globally.
[00:19:01.671 --> 00:19:03.512]  The EU and the UN are seen as the good guys.
[00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:04.532]  They come in.
[00:19:04.773 --> 00:19:06.813]  The terrorism's flipped off like a switch.
[00:19:07.653 --> 00:19:09.314]  And now America's demonized.
[00:19:09.374 --> 00:19:11.335]  And, oh, the EU, see, they can fix it.
[00:19:13.015 --> 00:19:14.796]  And that's exactly what I said would be done.
[00:19:14.816 --> 00:19:17.817]  And that's exactly what you're now going to see in the next few years.
[00:19:21.187 --> 00:19:22.587]  Bush may turn to U.N.
[00:19:22.647 --> 00:19:27.789]  in search for Iraq solution if troop surge fails strategy to involve other nations under U.N.
[00:19:28.249 --> 00:19:29.989]  Umbrella the London Guardian.
[00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:37.592]  Today, how long, how many times does it take for you to see this unfold?
[00:19:37.952 --> 00:19:43.173]  I'm talking to neocons out there and liberals until you figure out that you're being played like a fiddle.
[00:19:44.053 --> 00:19:49.355]  How long until you join
[00:19:51.005 --> 00:19:54.349]  The winning team, that's the people fighting the New World Order.
[00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:56.431]  There is no left and right.
[00:19:56.472 --> 00:19:58.974]  There's anti-New World Order and pro-New World Order.
[00:19:59.315 --> 00:20:00.036]  Choose sides.
[00:20:02.381 --> 00:20:04.382]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.002 --> 00:20:13.944]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.364 --> 00:20:21.566]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:27.802]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.282 --> 00:20:39.127]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:39.867 --> 00:20:41.928]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.429 --> 00:20:43.849]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:47.711 --> 00:21:06.842]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:08.063 --> 00:21:12.886]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:15.827]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:15.867 --> 00:21:16.968]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.903]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:23.844 --> 00:21:31.108]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:32.109 --> 00:21:35.171]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:35.411 --> 00:21:40.795]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:21:41.775 --> 00:21:43.036]  Call for your copy today.
[00:21:43.056 --> 00:21:43.256]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:52.368]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:21:53.089 --> 00:21:53.369]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.389 --> 00:21:53.710]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.192 --> 00:22:06.417]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:22:06.557 --> 00:22:14.644]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:22:14.904 --> 00:22:21.950]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.410]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:29.391]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:22:29.571 --> 00:22:34.672]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:22:34.772 --> 00:22:43.654]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[00:22:43.914 --> 00:22:47.215]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:23:05.286 --> 00:23:07.988]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[00:23:08.148 --> 00:23:10.569]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's dynamite in the garden.
[00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:17.534]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[00:23:17.814 --> 00:23:18.915]  What does this mean in the garden?
[00:23:18.995 --> 00:23:30.303]  It needs mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers, herbs that finally grow to medicinal strength, blue-ribbon garden produce jam-packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements, giant pumpkins, even high-potency, high-britch wheatgrass.
[00:23:30.383 --> 00:23:33.425]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[00:23:33.585 --> 00:23:36.166]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[00:23:36.387 --> 00:23:43.391]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[00:23:43.692 --> 00:23:45.793]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods.
[00:23:45.953 --> 00:23:48.335]  And might just be the ultimate hard times barter item.

[00:24:01.776 --> 00:24:03.917]  Agents!
[00:24:04.037 --> 00:24:05.398]  We are armed!
[00:24:05.418 --> 00:24:09.199]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.240]  Would you stand up or shoot?
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.302]  Or would you turn away too?
[00:24:14.602 --> 00:24:19.664]  And what if you saw all of the things that's right?
[00:24:19.724 --> 00:24:21.805]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[00:24:22.386 --> 00:24:25.507]  Or would you turn and walk away?
[00:24:25.587 --> 00:24:29.349]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[00:24:30.157 --> 00:24:32.038]  Would you stand up for truth?
[00:24:32.118 --> 00:24:34.938]  Or would you turn away too?
[00:24:35.459 --> 00:24:42.641]  And if not, if you so All of the things that's wrong Would you stand tall and strong?
[00:24:43.261 --> 00:24:44.721]  Or would you turn away?
[00:24:44.981 --> 00:24:59.946]  I see a message from the government Like every day I watch it and listen And call them all suckers They warning me about Osama or whatever Picture me buying the scam I said never You in tune to a hard truth soldier spitting I say commit it, give it up
[00:25:00.186 --> 00:25:00.806]  We're good to go.
[00:25:27.481 --> 00:25:28.102]  Welcome back.
[00:25:28.282 --> 00:25:31.226]  It's hard to cut off Paris, isn't it?
[00:25:46.594 --> 00:25:47.555]  One more line!
[00:26:08.609 --> 00:26:09.089]  Absolutely!
[00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:10.851]  Bring these dragons to their knees!
[00:26:10.891 --> 00:26:12.713]  We don't have a choice, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:35.294 --> 00:26:46.802]  So basically what they do with the Iraq War is they lie to us and tell us that we'll be out within six months guaranteed, promise the troops, when their own battle plans shed at least 30 years.
[00:26:47.263 --> 00:26:47.563]  Okay?
[00:26:47.583 --> 00:26:53.568]  I mean actual declassified government battle plans, 30 years military occupation.
[00:26:54.368 --> 00:26:58.311]  And then they tell the public, oh no, that's a conspiracy theory, we'll be back in six months.
[00:26:58.932 --> 00:27:02.595]  And then now we have people starting their fifth tours
[00:27:03.522 --> 00:27:18.210]  Over four plus years now in the country so folks starting their fifth tours and it's just going to go on and on and on and then it will become a UN operation they'll cut back some of the terrorism
[00:27:18.985 --> 00:27:36.991]  But still, keep some of it enough to have the excuse to keep UN forces there, who can then carry out little ethnic fights and ethnic cleansing operations and, you know, the forced sterilization and the poisoning of the water and the fluoridation and all the modernization that it's so important for the Arabs to have.
[00:27:37.011 --> 00:27:47.914]  Of course, we have PNAC documents where Dick Cheney talks about using race-specific bioweapons on the Arabs, but then complaining that, well, it'll kill Jews, too, that happen to be Semitic.
[00:27:48.573 --> 00:27:52.515]  Who happened to be Sephardic, like Aaron Russo is Sephardic.
[00:27:52.555 --> 00:27:53.835]  It would actually kill him.
[00:27:53.875 --> 00:27:56.156]  He actually is Jewish.
[00:27:57.036 --> 00:28:01.538]  It won't kill the 80% who are predominantly of a European derivation.
[00:28:02.839 --> 00:28:07.901]  But that is if they use a bioweapon on the Arabs, it will wipe out a bunch of Jews in Israel and would spread worldwide, of course.
[00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:15.824]  We'll probably get into a lot of the Oriental population because that's what the Arabs are, is a Caucasian slash Asian hybrid.
[00:28:16.873 --> 00:28:21.715]  But we are already now getting away from the subjects at hand here.
[00:28:22.836 --> 00:28:25.857]  We'll leave Iraq if they ask us.
[00:28:27.718 --> 00:28:28.058]  Hmm.
[00:28:30.139 --> 00:28:36.442]  We'll leave Iraq if they ask us, Bush is saying in a press conference he gave today.
[00:28:36.582 --> 00:28:37.323]  If they ask us.
[00:28:37.363 --> 00:28:39.604]  The puppet appointed government.
[00:28:39.644 --> 00:28:44.846]  I mean, if you believe that that was an election over there, I got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.691]  Okay, that is the most ridiculous propaganda ever.
[00:28:49.331 --> 00:28:53.513]  If they had a real election over there, it'd be the hardcore, radical Shiites, period.
[00:28:53.893 --> 00:28:56.814]  Which the media calls Al-Qaeda, which is the opposite of Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:56.994 --> 00:28:58.715]  Sunni is not Shia.
[00:28:59.055 --> 00:28:59.936]  Complete opposite.
[00:28:59.976 --> 00:29:04.958]  But again, if the committee chairman don't know that, you know the public doesn't know that.
[00:29:05.258 --> 00:29:08.159]  The CIA must be laughing all the way to the FEMA camp here.
[00:29:09.395 --> 00:29:10.937]  And we need to have the U.N.
[00:29:11.017 --> 00:29:11.317]  come in.
[00:29:11.357 --> 00:29:20.747]  The Bush administration is developing plans to internationalize the Iraq crisis, including an expanding role for the United Nations as a way to reduce overall U.S.
[00:29:20.787 --> 00:29:27.614]  responsibility for Iraq's future and limited domestic political fallout for the war as the 2008 election season approaches.
[00:29:27.934 --> 00:29:31.438]  So they put it into a process where four years, two months, three months later,
[00:29:32.151 --> 00:29:33.752]  And in a few years, it'll be U.N.
[00:29:33.812 --> 00:29:42.860]  forces backed up by U.S., and it'll just kind of fade off into the sunset, and it'll just be like Serbia, where we've still got troops, or Macedonia, or Germany.
[00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:46.022]  It'll just go on and on and on.
[00:29:46.462 --> 00:29:49.685]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more vital news.
[00:29:49.745 --> 00:29:50.205]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.667 --> 00:29:52.687]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.068 --> 00:29:54.669]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.272]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:05.253]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:30:05.513 --> 00:30:06.374]  Look no further!
[00:30:06.674 --> 00:30:09.256]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:30:09.676 --> 00:30:18.203]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:30:18.343 --> 00:30:19.104]  You can order everything
[00:30:19.104 --> 00:30:19.645]  We're good to go.
[00:30:35.925 --> 00:30:36.205]  I'm good.
[00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:13.219]  JLS Research, the makers of all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[00:31:13.439 --> 00:31:19.944]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[00:31:20.104 --> 00:31:27.750]  By using organics and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.691]  As it responds,
[00:31:28.971 --> 00:31:30.973]  Body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[00:31:31.273 --> 00:31:33.094]  First Responder is the first of its kind.
[00:31:33.194 --> 00:31:34.776]  Comprised of only four organics.
[00:31:35.076 --> 00:31:38.358]  Grape seed skins, grape seeds, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[00:31:38.719 --> 00:31:43.202]  It's so effective you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[00:31:43.502 --> 00:31:45.984]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.

[00:32:02.256 --> 00:32:09.061]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two-book set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[00:32:09.421 --> 00:32:15.826]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[00:32:16.306 --> 00:32:26.213]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[00:32:26.693 --> 00:32:30.136]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[00:32:30.436 --> 00:32:33.117]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[00:32:33.758 --> 00:32:36.459]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.

[00:33:11.147 --> 00:33:19.672]  Coming up, BBC, ABC News reporter, best-selling author Greg Pallis will be joining us to talk about oil prices, how that's being rigged at the pumps.
[00:33:19.712 --> 00:33:21.673]  We have the actual oil company documents.
[00:33:22.113 --> 00:33:26.836]  We'll also be getting into the Iraq war going on now for over four years.
[00:33:26.876 --> 00:33:31.118]  We'll have open phones before Pallis joins us, though, from noon to 12.30.
[00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:36.453]  Right now we're joined by Kent Snyder.
[00:33:37.054 --> 00:33:40.256]  He is the chairman of the Ron Paul for President campaign.
[00:33:40.276 --> 00:33:45.039]  He's also the head of the campaign itself, the campaign director.
[00:33:45.359 --> 00:33:49.602]  You can check out the campaign website at RonPaul2008.com.
[00:33:49.642 --> 00:33:53.064]  We have links to it up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:53.384 --> 00:33:59.508]  By the way, we have a great new article out on PrisonPlanet.com today that is made up of the last few years of interviews with Ron Paul.
[00:33:59.888 --> 00:34:01.509]  Some of the most notable quotes
[00:34:01.969 --> 00:34:07.554]  And comments from the war, to the New World Order, to the plunging dollar, you name it.
[00:34:07.594 --> 00:34:10.037]  Just amazing information on the Congressman.
[00:34:10.797 --> 00:34:11.858]  It's great.
[00:34:11.898 --> 00:34:17.003]  In fact, I've seen big Democratic websites posting it, and conservative sites going, I didn't know this about him!
[00:34:17.343 --> 00:34:18.064]  He's great!
[00:34:18.144 --> 00:34:18.604]  That's it!
[00:34:18.684 --> 00:34:20.967]  I'm sending him campaign contributions.
[00:34:21.247 --> 00:34:23.369]  I mean, I want Kent Sinatra to know this.
[00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:24.430]  I know the Congressman knows this.
[00:34:25.674 --> 00:34:31.281]  My great listeners, and I just want to thank all of you who are out there really taking action on the internet.
[00:34:31.741 --> 00:34:38.069]  We are the strongest brigade in this army in the fight to try to get a true constitutionalist in as the president.
[00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:40.072]  He actually has a chance to win
[00:34:40.732 --> 00:34:47.314]  Ladies and gentlemen, and that's why the media, the controlled corporate media, is in overdrive right now, trying to spin this.
[00:34:47.894 --> 00:35:01.278]  And Kent Snyder, of course, was there helping with the campaign in 88, when Ron Paul ran as a Libertarian for President, and he is now there as Ron Paul runs as a Republican for the party's nomination.
[00:35:01.298 --> 00:35:03.639]  And if he wins, he can beat Hillary Clinton.
[00:35:03.999 --> 00:35:05.500]  Kent Snyder, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:06.740]  Thanks for having me, thank you.
[00:35:07.381 --> 00:35:11.623]  Kent, let's just go out of the gates here to what the mainstream media is trying to do.
[00:35:12.363 --> 00:35:19.607]  Big neocon websites, fake liberal sites everywhere that supposedly track the race aren't even allowing him to be voted on now.
[00:35:19.687 --> 00:35:23.609]  They put big posts up saying he's a spammer, so he's banned.
[00:35:24.249 --> 00:35:25.149]  That's not the case.
[00:35:25.189 --> 00:35:26.210]  He's got the support.
[00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:30.792]  This type of slander is being used to try to restrict the people's will.
[00:35:31.112 --> 00:35:32.553]  How do we get through this roadblock?
[00:35:33.613 --> 00:35:41.958]  Well, I think we keep doing what we're doing and show to these folks that support for Dr. Paul is genuine, it's real, it's growing.
[00:35:42.738 --> 00:35:44.059]  I get this all the time anymore.
[00:35:44.099 --> 00:35:51.764]  In fact, today during the press conference I was quizzed by some CNN reporters and a few others asking about this very subject you bring up at this moment.
[00:35:52.344 --> 00:35:55.686]  And I said, you know, what I don't understand is that you're dismissing the support.
[00:35:56.046 --> 00:36:00.849]  You're acting as if the support out there for Dr. Paul is by phantoms.
[00:36:01.409 --> 00:36:02.230]  These people are real.
[00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:06.215]  They use the internet, they use technology to express their support.
[00:36:06.856 --> 00:36:17.568]  You guys, the networks like Fox News during the South Carolina debate, you touted this so-called online poll, you advertised it, you kept promoting it time and time again during the run-up to the debate, during the debate.
[00:36:18.067 --> 00:36:23.354]  And when your candidate or the candidate you didn't want won, then you dismissed it.
[00:36:23.454 --> 00:36:29.781]  So it's very frustrating, but I think most people see just how obvious a tactic it is on their part.
[00:36:30.022 --> 00:36:31.523]  Well, there's two parts to this.
[00:36:31.543 --> 00:36:33.346]  Of course, there's more than that, but two main parts.
[00:36:33.866 --> 00:36:40.290]  Number one, they claim, well, if he's showing 1, 2, 3 percent in the national polls, how can he be winning every online poll?
[00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:41.630]  It's two different worlds.
[00:36:41.670 --> 00:37:00.901]  You've got the informed population that's on the web, that's tuning out TV and mainline newspapers, that is becoming the majority that knows about Ron Paul, and you've still got the couch potatoes that are still mesmerized by CNN and Fox News, but now they're learning about Ron Paul, and when they get a chance to see him, they're resonating.
[00:37:01.321 --> 00:37:02.962]  That's number one, but then number two,
[00:37:04.131 --> 00:37:08.173]  Yeah, and you bring up some great points in addition to what you mentioned.
[00:37:22.101 --> 00:37:31.228]  The news has been talking for the last year or two about, because of their changes in society, about people not participating in polls.
[00:37:31.268 --> 00:37:32.389]  In other words, they're not being asked.
[00:37:32.449 --> 00:37:43.917]  I mean, the major pollsters have been complaining that the terrain is changing because of the Internet, because of technology, because of lifestyles, cell phones, instant messaging, caller ID, etc.
[00:37:44.537 --> 00:37:45.819]  Now people aren't being called.
[00:37:45.859 --> 00:37:51.586]  The pollsters themselves are saying that they're having a difficult time finding people, getting a hold of people.
[00:37:51.967 --> 00:37:53.549]  So that's another dimension.
[00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:56.032]  Well you just hit the nail on the head and I guess that's really the key.
[00:37:56.493 --> 00:37:57.434]  So it is three here.
[00:37:58.278 --> 00:38:00.999]  Literally, most of Americans have tuned out.
[00:38:01.039 --> 00:38:03.400]  They've decided it's all bought and paid for, both parties.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:11.583]  And so basically, the majority that had tuned out and turned loose and basically given up is coming back to the table now because of Ron Paul.
[00:38:11.603 --> 00:38:17.346]  And that's what I'm seeing in the posts, in the comments, in the emails, all over the internet on mainstream sites.
[00:38:17.586 --> 00:38:18.386]  I'm seeing that.
[00:38:18.626 --> 00:38:23.428]  Democrats who are saying, I wasn't going to vote anymore because the Democrats are warmongers, bought and paid for.
[00:38:23.688 --> 00:38:25.929]  Republicans who said the whole field is a joke.
[00:38:26.209 --> 00:38:27.130]  They're coming back.
[00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:30.652]  We're seeing a real populist constitutionalist here.
[00:38:30.992 --> 00:38:32.153]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:38:32.273 --> 00:38:36.435]  And I get those sorts of messages and phone calls all the time, which is quite encouraging.
[00:38:36.975 --> 00:38:42.939]  And I mean, that is something that people like yourself and your listeners and us and others are recognizing.
[00:38:43.299 --> 00:38:49.483]  Keep in mind, though, that the press, traditionally in America, the press is usually about two to three or five years late.
[00:38:50.794 --> 00:38:56.322]  In recognizing trends in American society, culture, fashion, business, technology, medicine, etc.
[00:38:57.083 --> 00:39:04.294]  For some reason, it just seems to me, I've seen studies on this, where the press is just late, and I think they're late on this subject.
[00:39:05.815 --> 00:39:15.204]  Well, I agree with that, but also they try to suppress trends and they act like they don't know about them until it's just so widely accepted they've got to then act like they were always with us.
[00:39:16.585 --> 00:39:17.286]  I agree with that.
[00:39:17.426 --> 00:39:29.618]  I'm not dismissing that there's not some sort of orchestrated effort to either suppress or promote their own candidate, but when you consider it, those two reasons, you know, I mean, why listen to these people anymore?
[00:39:30.326 --> 00:39:54.859]  Aaron Russo, who I know is a good friend of mine, also a good friend of the Congressman's, I was talking to him just a few days ago and he said he talked to the Congressman and obviously Ron's really intelligent on his own right and I would imagine you guys don't want to give up too much of the strategy, but I think that if Ron Paul counterattacks Giuliani and says, hey, I want 30 seconds and really gets aggressive, which I know he's capable of,
[00:39:55.499 --> 00:39:59.362]  Uh, and, and brings up, hey Giuliani, you've made 50 million bucks off 9-11.
[00:39:59.442 --> 00:40:04.206]  Hey Giuliani, most of the firefighters say you did a really bad job covering up the dust.
[00:40:04.466 --> 00:40:07.649]  Hey Giuliani, how dare you wrap yourself in the mantle of 9-11.
[00:40:08.029 --> 00:40:18.137]  I mean, I think if he goes after Giuliani or goes after Giuliani, uh, on gun control or taxes, I mean, I think if he attacks Giuliani, that that'll cause another big eruption.
[00:40:18.538 --> 00:40:21.120]  I mean, uh, I mean, does that sound like a good angle to you?
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:26.141]  No, I think it is an angle, and I think that people are actually picking it up on their own.
[00:40:26.201 --> 00:40:32.103]  But to your point, this morning, just about an hour and a half ago, we had a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington.
[00:40:32.483 --> 00:40:38.165]  There is already an article out on the Washington Post today, which people can look up, and the title of the article is, U.S.
[00:40:38.225 --> 00:40:40.565]  Candidate Paul Assigns Reading to Giuliani.
[00:40:40.946 --> 00:40:42.066]  And Dr. Paul, in the very
[00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:51.132]  I guess respectful, but not firm and forceful way, told the public today that Rudy Giuliani needs to learn about American foreign policy.
[00:40:51.392 --> 00:40:54.675]  And he probably needs to learn about several other subjects as you just got through listening.
[00:40:54.715 --> 00:41:08.665]  But this morning, Dr. Paul strongly suggested to Mr. Giuliani, look, you need to read, you need to learn, you try to present yourself as a 9-11 expert, as a security expert, you don't know anything about it, and stop saying that you do.
[00:41:10.385 --> 00:41:12.787]  Now obviously, we've got a lot of listeners.
[00:41:13.027 --> 00:41:14.087]  I'm a 9-11 truther.
[00:41:14.107 --> 00:41:18.990]  We believe there's a lot of suspicious things coming up, going on.
[00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:25.815]  We know that Ron Paul has said that he thinks there should be a new real investigation and many members of Congress
[00:41:26.295 --> 00:41:34.986]  I agree with that, and I know this is a big political hot potato, and to be clear, Ron Paul is talking about the whole general foreign policy.
[00:41:35.286 --> 00:41:45.639]  The Pentagon admits that being over there does stimulate real organic resistance, which is then called terrorism, and to have Giuliani then deny that,
[00:41:46.279 --> 00:41:57.846]  Really is denying reality, but then it also upsets a lot of 9-11 troopers because the media has been interpreting it as saying that Ron Paul is, you know, specifically taking a position on 9-11.
[00:41:58.106 --> 00:42:12.935]  I mean, I think it's clear that Ron Paul is politically taking the safe position here and a position based on reality when you just talk about suicide bombings and, you know, a woman going on an Israeli bus and stabbing, you know, 18 people or whatever.
[00:42:13.695 --> 00:42:14.496]  Can you comment on that?
[00:42:15.097 --> 00:42:26.914]  Well, you know, Dr. Paul's main issue, as you just mentioned, is foreign policy and how 50 years of American foreign policy makes America less safe, not more safe, as Giuliani and others contend.
[00:42:27.475 --> 00:42:28.216]  He explains it.
[00:42:28.276 --> 00:42:29.979]  He's very educated on the subject.
[00:42:30.739 --> 00:42:33.420]  He's been a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee for many years.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.040]  He studied it.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.101]  This is a very important issue for him.
[00:42:36.141 --> 00:42:39.962]  He always believes that the most important issue that any member of Congress or U.S.
[00:42:40.002 --> 00:42:44.724]  government has is to decide whether or not to send American citizens in harm's way.
[00:42:44.764 --> 00:42:46.364]  So he takes it very, very seriously.
[00:42:46.384 --> 00:42:47.925]  And he knows the issues.
[00:42:48.425 --> 00:42:54.927]  And he's not afraid, as he demonstrated in South Carolina, to buck the trend and to state the truth.
[00:42:55.727 --> 00:43:02.312]  Uh, as it is, and to let people, uh, even if it makes them uncomfortable, so be it, because, uh, there's too much at stake.
[00:43:02.372 --> 00:43:10.639]  So, his main issue is American, uh, foreign policy, and how that has made America less safe, and is actually bad for the countries that we're meddling in.
[00:43:11.209 --> 00:43:19.756]  Well, up on PrisonPlanet.com right now, we do have multiple articles that are coming out concerning Ron Paul and his press conference today with the head of the Bin Laden unit.
[00:43:20.157 --> 00:43:36.310]  So even if you, let's just say we buy the official story of 9-11 for debate here, and the government's saying, let's give up all our rights, let's go attack all these nations, the CIA, even inside the official story, is saying that this makes
[00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:41.573]  This stimulates more terrorism, more resistance, and makes Americans less safe.
[00:43:41.813 --> 00:43:44.675]  So on it's face, the war on terror makes us less safe.
[00:43:45.035 --> 00:43:56.743]  Exactly, and that's the very point that Michael Shoyer, who was the former chief of the Bin Laden unit at the CIA... I mean, people have to understand that Michael Shoyer was the number one man in the U.S.
[00:43:56.803 --> 00:43:57.223]  government
[00:43:57.751 --> 00:44:04.796]  To know more about Bin Laden, to know his history, all of his background, his intentions, his location, everything.
[00:44:05.256 --> 00:44:07.838]  He was the number one man in the entire U.S.
[00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:08.258]  government.
[00:44:08.438 --> 00:44:09.579]  That was his charge.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:17.865]  He was on the ground in Afghanistan, he was the head of that unit during Clinton's time, and a couple years into Bush's time, and that's exactly what he said.
[00:44:17.985 --> 00:44:19.126]  Completely apolitical.
[00:44:19.806 --> 00:44:23.509]  My job as a professional who knows Bin Laden probably better than any American
[00:44:24.221 --> 00:44:26.802]  This is why he's motivated to do what he does.
[00:44:26.842 --> 00:44:27.723]  It doesn't excuse it.
[00:44:28.283 --> 00:44:30.044]  It doesn't make it right at all.
[00:44:30.444 --> 00:44:32.925]  But this is why he does it.
[00:44:33.005 --> 00:44:38.848]  It's like, for example, as Dr. Paul said, if someone commits murder, it doesn't excuse the act of murder.
[00:44:38.988 --> 00:44:40.849]  In fact, it's heinous and it's deplorable.
[00:44:41.229 --> 00:44:45.692]  But the very first thing that investigators do is try to investigate why the person did it.
[00:44:45.772 --> 00:44:48.213]  It doesn't excuse it, but why the murderer did his act.
[00:44:49.077 --> 00:44:56.539]  And if the guy murdered somebody because he found his wife in bed with another man, he's probably going to get a year in prison instead of the death penalty.
[00:44:56.959 --> 00:44:58.280]  Right, right.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:06.842]  We have to understand our enemies and what's going on, and that's what Dr. Paul is saying, that's what Mike Shoyer is saying, that's what all these other...
[00:45:07.302 --> 00:45:08.303]  We're good to go.
[00:45:23.371 --> 00:45:33.859]  I tell you, I don't know how Giuliani and Bush and others are going to deal with this when their own CIA starts coming out, as they've already written, and saying, this policy makes us less safe.
[00:45:34.079 --> 00:45:35.240]  But the Pentagon's not dumb.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:50.892]  They have P2OG, the plan written up in 2002, to go invade Iraq, to actually stir up more resistance, and actually export revolution, and try to turn the whole Middle East into a cauldron, actually make Saudi Arabia fall to Muslim extremists,
[00:45:51.192 --> 00:45:54.636]  So the military-industrial complex has an excuse to go in there.
[00:45:54.936 --> 00:45:57.518]  Frankly, I don't think the Pentagon and Bush are even dumb.
[00:45:57.839 --> 00:46:01.162]  They know this is good for business to widen conflicts.
[00:46:01.442 --> 00:46:01.963]  Oh, sure.
[00:46:02.684 --> 00:46:05.787]  It feeds right into the military-industrial complex.
[00:46:05.847 --> 00:46:08.830]  I mean, most people know if they just take a moment and think about it.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:19.692]  It is now clear that the intention to go into Iraq, to take out Saddam Hussein, to take over Iraq, was the first order of business when George Bush took office.
[00:46:19.732 --> 00:46:23.016]  And this was before 9-11 ever happened.
[00:46:23.277 --> 00:46:24.919]  No one ever imagined that was going on.
[00:46:25.555 --> 00:46:33.485]  Unfortunately, when you have nations that build empires, whether it's today or a hundred years ago or a thousand years ago, this is the same result happens.
[00:46:33.505 --> 00:46:36.208]  The nations who try to become an empire can't afford it.
[00:46:36.228 --> 00:46:36.949]  They go broke.
[00:46:36.969 --> 00:46:38.471]  They create a lot of misery.
[00:46:39.092 --> 00:46:40.554]  And unfortunately, that's what's happening.
[00:46:42.583 --> 00:46:57.469]  You're absolutely right, but it doesn't matter if the nations go bankrupt, because we've already seen the corporations that claim that they're pro-America and wrap themselves in the flag, literally scurrying like rats leaving a sinking ship, evacuating the United States.
[00:46:57.509 --> 00:46:59.110]  I mean, look at Halliburton going to Dubai.
[00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:00.511]  I mean, that's scary.
[00:47:00.531 --> 00:47:01.491]  Does that concern you?
[00:47:01.731 --> 00:47:05.713]  Again, we're talking to Ron Paul's campaign director and campaign chairman, Ken Schneider.
[00:47:06.844 --> 00:47:17.172]  Yeah, it does, and it really goes to a very important point, and that is these people, these multinational corporations, the people who run them, I'm convinced
[00:47:17.788 --> 00:47:20.049]  That they don't see the United States as their country.
[00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:25.733]  They simply consider the United States as one spoke in their wheel, as I call it, their wheel of fortune.
[00:47:26.373 --> 00:47:33.197]  And their interest is worldwide, their investments are worldwide, and they travel worldwide.
[00:47:33.217 --> 00:47:35.858]  They consider themselves to be citizens of the world.
[00:47:35.898 --> 00:47:46.404]  And again, America, the United States, is simply one spoke in their wheel of fortune, which is why they want the North American Union, they want a world currency, and the list goes on.
[00:47:46.544 --> 00:47:47.285]  This is really
[00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:49.926]  How these people think, and that's what they believe.
[00:47:50.446 --> 00:48:16.153]  Well, expanding on that, they don't just use, and you're absolutely right, use the United States as a base of operations without any concern to our sovereignty or any fealty to the country or any allegiance, but they come in and lobby, as Ron Paul has said just this weekend when he gave a speech in Austin in a fundraiser, they actually lobby and control government to extract the middle class's wealth to then transfer it to them to then invest it overseas.
[00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:17.554]  Oh, sure, sure.
[00:48:17.874 --> 00:48:19.375]  I mean, Washington D.C.
[00:48:19.515 --> 00:48:23.157]  is, well, there's all sorts of ways of describing it.
[00:48:23.237 --> 00:48:25.058]  I typically call it the Twilight Zone.
[00:48:25.598 --> 00:48:31.841]  And when you're here and you look around and you see what's going on, I mean, everybody would have their own name for it.
[00:48:31.881 --> 00:48:33.242]  But this actually goes on.
[00:48:33.642 --> 00:48:36.364]  I tell people that when you come to Washington D.C.
[00:48:36.424 --> 00:48:42.547]  and you go out to the airports and you look at the tarmac and there are several 25, 30, 40 million dollar corporate aircraft.
[00:48:45.376 --> 00:48:47.198]  These people come to Washington, D.C.
[00:48:47.719 --> 00:48:48.760]  not to wave the flag.
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.884]  They come to do business and they expect something for their investment.
[00:48:53.125 --> 00:48:58.312]  And so when they land at Reagan National or Dulles or Baltimore and come into D.C.
[00:48:58.852 --> 00:49:02.196]  on their chauffeured cars, they are here for business.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.681]  Absolutely, until they get back to the hotels and the hookers at night.
[00:49:08.042 --> 00:49:09.022]  That's another subject, yes.
[00:49:09.362 --> 00:49:12.624]  Yes, they're ubiquitous like water fountains.
[00:49:13.844 --> 00:49:14.985]  I mean, D.C.
[00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:17.086]  is like a modern Babylon, is it not now?
[00:49:17.726 --> 00:49:18.486]  Oh, I think it is.
[00:49:18.546 --> 00:49:19.887]  I think it's even worse.
[00:49:23.608 --> 00:49:33.070]  Well, I could go on and on about it, but unfortunately what goes on here does affect so many people in the United States first, and unfortunately it affects people around the world as well.
[00:49:33.631 --> 00:49:43.893]  And it's just like a feeding frenzy in terms of trying to get something for nothing, trying to use power for their own individual ends, and it's just not a good place.
[00:49:44.525 --> 00:49:51.031]  We're about to break and I just want to do four or five minutes on the other side until this hour ends with Kent Schneider with Ron Paul campaign.
[00:49:51.051 --> 00:49:53.373]  He is the campaign director and the campaign chairman.
[00:49:53.393 --> 00:49:59.198]  The website is RonPaul2008.com or 1-800-RON-PAUL to donate or to support.
[00:49:59.398 --> 00:50:01.080]  I want to come back and just talk about electioneering.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:12.702]  How to get people involved, how to get Ron Paul to win the Republican primaries, what that strategy is, and obviously we know that there's going to be more and more attack pieces.
[00:50:12.742 --> 00:50:20.244]  We know they're busy trying to dig up dirt, trying to manufacture things that Ron Paul didn't even write, and I want to talk about strategies to block that.
[00:50:20.924 --> 00:50:23.045]  But just in a minute, we've got a lot before the break.
[00:50:23.625 --> 00:50:25.005]  What's coming up just in the next few weeks?
[00:50:25.765 --> 00:50:28.887]  Well, Dr. Paul will be Friday.
[00:50:29.187 --> 00:50:30.848]  He'll be in studio in Los Angeles.
[00:50:30.868 --> 00:50:35.790]  We'll be traveling tomorrow morning to be on the Bill Maher Show on HBO Friday night.
[00:50:36.291 --> 00:50:41.493]  And that should be an interesting interview since Bill Maher recently said that Ron Paul is his hero.
[00:50:42.254 --> 00:50:48.977]  And then Dr. Paul will be back in the district for Memorial Day week because it's obviously his first obligation as a sitting congressman.
[00:50:49.437 --> 00:50:52.459]  And then we'll be getting prepared for the CNN debates on Tuesday the 5th.
[00:50:54.296 --> 00:50:54.957]  Absolutely.
[00:50:55.037 --> 00:50:59.800]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the final segment with Kent Snyder from Ron Paul 2008.
[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:05.063]  It's here.
[00:51:05.263 --> 00:51:10.027]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.407 --> 00:51:18.012]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:25.804]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.184 --> 00:51:37.610]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:41.592]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.873 --> 00:51:43.834]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.154 --> 00:51:48.016]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:02.258 --> 00:52:03.018]  Terrorism!

[00:52:11.284 --> 00:52:13.766]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:14.146 --> 00:52:28.716]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:28.756 --> 00:52:29.077]  government.
[00:52:29.237 --> 00:52:31.038]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:52:31.418 --> 00:52:37.319]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:52:37.459 --> 00:52:41.940]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:53:02.918 --> 00:53:06.620]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:06.941 --> 00:53:09.162]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:53:09.683 --> 00:53:15.887]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.047 --> 00:53:20.951]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.151 --> 00:53:30.098]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:54:01.252 --> 00:54:14.912]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss.
[00:54:25.644 --> 00:54:27.665]  Ron Paul, 2008.com.
[00:54:27.685 --> 00:54:29.366]  They need volunteers all across the country.
[00:54:29.406 --> 00:54:31.327]  They need financial support.
[00:54:31.347 --> 00:54:34.129]  1-800-RON-PAUL, 1-800-RON-PAUL.
[00:54:35.489 --> 00:54:39.952]  Final segment with Ken Shinoda, the Congressman will join us after the holiday on Tuesday for 30 minutes.
[00:54:41.336 --> 00:54:48.556]  But I really like what they're doing, going after Rudy Giuliani, pointing out that his claim of a giant war on terror is a fraud.
[00:54:49.332 --> 00:54:51.054]  Some of us may not completely agree.
[00:54:51.074 --> 00:54:54.897]  You know, it's even worse than just saying our policy makes them attack us.
[00:54:54.937 --> 00:54:59.521]  In some cases, we know it goes even further than that with provocateuring and staged events.
[00:55:00.041 --> 00:55:08.108]  But bottom line, we know the policy is causing real organic resistance, terrorism, whatever the term you want to use.
[00:55:08.648 --> 00:55:10.630]  And he is definitely right on that.
[00:55:12.049 --> 00:55:13.650]  Kent Snyder, we were talking during the break.
[00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:21.775]  I don't want to put words in your mouth or repeat what you said off air to me, but we've all been noticing Ron Paul's getting more aggressive.
[00:55:22.455 --> 00:55:28.899]  It seems like he is when he got ganged up on on Fox News, or when O'Reilly tried to gang up on him, he got in O'Reilly's space.
[00:55:28.999 --> 00:55:31.100]  What's happening with the Congressman?
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:37.824]  I mean, you did say during the break, still waters run deep, but you said some other things, but how much can you say about the metamorphosis of the Congressman?
[00:55:38.164 --> 00:55:47.247]  Well, I've known Dr. Paul since 1988 and have been a great admirer of his and so I've seen some changes in Dr. Paul, some very good things.
[00:55:47.267 --> 00:55:50.108]  I think they were always there about his traits.
[00:55:50.128 --> 00:55:57.671]  Yes, steel waters run deep and I think Dr. Paul, when he gets ganged up, he gets a little defensive or aggressive, which he should, understandably so.
[00:55:58.071 --> 00:56:05.494]  But the more important point is I honestly know that Dr. Paul realizes the opportunity that he has, that we all have,
[00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:07.290]  It's a very critical time.
[00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:13.692]  I believe, and I don't think this is overdramatic, but I believe that we are all a part of making history.
[00:56:13.972 --> 00:56:17.072]  I don't know how that's going to play out, but I think we legitimately are.
[00:56:17.453 --> 00:56:21.613]  People here in my office, myself, Dr. Paul, and others, we're not that special.
[00:56:21.633 --> 00:56:23.794]  We're not that big of a deal, if you will.
[00:56:23.954 --> 00:56:25.474]  Well, it does seem to be charmed.
[00:56:25.514 --> 00:56:27.455]  It does seem to have something magic about it.
[00:56:27.475 --> 00:56:28.475]  There's a spirit about it.
[00:56:28.815 --> 00:56:35.683]  Yes, and I think Dr. Paul understands that and he sees it and he's a real trooper, very energetic.
[00:56:35.803 --> 00:56:42.250]  He understands that we have the right message and I'm just thrilled that he is being energized all day.
[00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:46.595]  I can't hardly keep up with him myself and he's older than I am.
[00:56:48.118 --> 00:56:50.720]  Yeah, my dad said, my God, he looks good for 71.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:51.901]  He looks like he's 60.
[00:56:52.321 --> 00:56:53.922]  And you were telling me during the break, he acts like he's 40.
[00:56:54.483 --> 00:56:55.143]  Yes, he does.
[00:56:55.423 --> 00:57:03.630]  And so anyway, we're encouraged by his leadership and his humbleness and his message and his history that people know him.
[00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:05.591]  And he keeps us going.
[00:57:05.711 --> 00:57:08.293]  And, you know, I'm just happy to be a part of that.
[00:57:08.473 --> 00:57:18.044]  Well, in an age where they call themselves the honorable this, the honorable that, the authorities, the officials, he just calls himself a humble public servant, and it's such a breath of fresh air.
[00:57:18.464 --> 00:57:22.970]  Folks, Republican, Democrat, you want to agree with everything he says, but you know he's better
[00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:26.112]  Then that disgusting gaggle of Democrats and Republicans.
[00:57:26.152 --> 00:57:31.756]  I mean, they're all really shameful, big government, pro-imperial, elitist.
[00:57:32.216 --> 00:57:34.918]  I mean, even Gravel and Tancredo.
[00:57:34.938 --> 00:57:37.340]  Don't hold a candle to Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:39.121]  We've all got to get behind him.
[00:57:39.561 --> 00:57:48.588]  In closing, how are you going to deal with the attempts to manufacture, we've already seen a couple failures at that in the last two weeks, as the establishment tries to manufacture skeletons?
[00:57:49.188 --> 00:58:01.083]  Well, you know, I guess we take it as a compliment because Len Nofziger and others, Len passed away recently, basically said, you're not doing anything, you're not making any difference unless people are attacking you.
[00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:11.416]  So we consider that to be a compliment and as a measure of the effort that Dr. Paul, the campaign, people like yourself and your listeners and others around the country are mobilizing.
[00:58:12.336 --> 00:58:16.139]  Our enemies and opponents understand it, and so we welcome those attacks.
[00:58:16.179 --> 00:58:20.221]  We'll deal with them one at a time, but we will not change our message.
[00:58:21.551 --> 00:58:22.572]  Thank you for the time.
[00:58:22.672 --> 00:58:23.693]  Have a great weekend.
[00:58:23.713 --> 00:58:26.194]  I know you'll be working throughout tomorrow and the weekend.
[00:58:26.254 --> 00:58:26.435]  Yes.
[00:58:26.515 --> 00:58:29.557]  And hope to get updates from you every few weeks as this develops.
[00:58:29.917 --> 00:58:31.959]  Kent Schneider, as he said, it is history.
[00:58:32.239 --> 00:58:33.740]  The Congressman is scheduled Tuesday.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:34.500]  Thank you, sir.
[00:58:34.801 --> 00:58:35.461]  Thanks for having me.
[00:58:35.581 --> 00:58:35.721]  Bye.
[00:58:35.741 --> 00:58:36.121]  You bet.
[00:58:36.141 --> 00:58:37.763]  RonPaul2008.com.
[00:58:38.063 --> 00:58:39.444]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[00:58:41.605 --> 00:58:45.508]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.848 --> 00:58:46.629]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.604 --> 00:58:58.245]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.905 --> 00:58:59.965]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.665 --> 00:59:01.826]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.426 --> 00:59:03.266]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.006 --> 00:59:04.886]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.567 --> 00:59:09.528]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.768 --> 00:59:13.849]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:28.722]  By the way, we got Jim Tucker popping in Friday for a 10-minute update on the new things they've discovered about Bilderberg.
[00:59:28.742 --> 00:59:31.824]  He's coming up in Istanbul, Turkey in about a week.
[00:59:32.404 --> 00:59:39.208]  In fact, in a week he will be in Istanbul reporting in next Thursday live for us on the first day of Bilderberg.
[00:59:39.228 --> 00:59:39.968]  So look forward to that.
[00:59:40.328 --> 00:59:43.250]  Greg Pallast is coming up in the next 30 minutes.
[00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:46.192]  I have tons of news here, but I promise to get to your calls.
[00:59:46.532 --> 00:59:47.452]  Let's go to your calls.
[00:59:47.832 --> 00:59:49.213]  Let's talk to Rick in Michigan.
[00:59:49.293 --> 00:59:50.114]  Rick, you're on the air.
[00:59:50.174 --> 00:59:50.594]  Go ahead.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:52.741]  Hey, my name's Rick from Grand Lodge.
[00:59:53.762 --> 00:59:53.942]  Hello?
[00:59:54.202 --> 00:59:54.883]  Yes, go ahead, sir.
[00:59:55.223 --> 00:59:57.364]  Yes, I was wondering how convenient it was today.
[00:59:57.404 --> 01:00:05.110]  I've been waiting for two weeks to see the two guys that were putting out loose change, and the guy that was in Tower 2, the janitor.
[01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:07.131]  I heard the explosions happen in the basement.
[01:00:07.211 --> 01:00:10.834]  William Rodriguez, and then Bush's press conference goes over the top of the meeting.
[01:00:10.854 --> 01:00:12.055]  Yeah, and how convenient was that?
[01:00:13.635 --> 01:00:21.599]  I mean, on mainstream TV, we're going to finally get a little bit of truth out here, and then he comes on with a no-nonsense conference, you know?
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.100]  I don't understand that.
[01:00:23.881 --> 01:00:32.165]  Well, I don't want to give the whole game away here, but you notice that ABC had it in their schedule that they were going to be on today, right?
[01:00:32.305 --> 01:00:32.505]  Yeah.
[01:00:32.625 --> 01:00:35.467]  They put that up last Wednesday, or eight, nine days ago.
[01:00:36.428 --> 01:00:39.309]  And then they were not going to be on today.
[01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:42.511]  As we announced yesterday, it was canceled.
[01:00:43.271 --> 01:00:45.612]  Oh, I didn't hear you, that part, yesterday.
[01:00:45.672 --> 01:00:53.175]  Yes, it was cancelled, but it didn't matter, there was still magically a press conference, which, you know, it was probably a coincidence, who knows.
[01:00:53.976 --> 01:00:58.178]  But maybe you'll see people pop up, maybe not, we're just going to leave it at that.
[01:00:58.938 --> 01:01:03.540]  Alright, and then one other thing, is there a way to find out how much personally Bush is making off?
[01:01:05.849 --> 01:01:07.029]  It's all very secretive.
[01:01:07.049 --> 01:01:14.112]  The Bush family, you'll see it in Parade Magazine every year, they'll claim that Bush is worth a million dollars and his daddy's worth two million.
[01:01:15.233 --> 01:01:15.953]  That's false.
[01:01:15.973 --> 01:01:24.037]  I mean, they get ten million dollar book deals, but their money all goes into offshore bank accounts, it goes into foundations, it goes into trust.
[01:01:24.437 --> 01:01:25.658]  They own oil companies.
[01:01:25.698 --> 01:01:27.959]  They own triple hull super tanker fleets.
[01:01:28.799 --> 01:01:30.340]  Sixty years ago, forty years ago,
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.141]  They own a whole banking chain in Texas.
[01:01:34.661 --> 01:01:39.462]  When you hear Bill Gates is worth $60 billion folks, that's a joke.
[01:01:39.502 --> 01:01:40.623]  He's worth a lot more than that.
[01:01:40.883 --> 01:01:43.484]  And when you hear he's the richest man in the world, that's a joke.
[01:01:43.724 --> 01:01:48.525]  The Queen of England owns the majority of British Petroleum that makes hundreds of billions a year.
[01:01:49.565 --> 01:01:55.168]  The Queen of England, you know, owns whole areas of South Africa in the diamond trade.
[01:01:55.869 --> 01:02:03.513]  And it's the same thing with these other elites, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, but their money's all tax-free in giant multinational corporations.
[01:02:05.834 --> 01:02:13.458]  Okay, so we don't know the wealth of the real elite, but the Bushes, it is reported, are worth over $200 billion from researchers that have looked at it.
[01:02:13.962 --> 01:02:17.626]  So Iraq really doesn't have any control over the oil that's going out of their country right now.
[01:02:17.866 --> 01:02:19.027]  It's not about the oil.
[01:02:19.067 --> 01:02:26.615]  We know a lot of it's being fenced out and sold, but notice they turned off most of the oil, which artificial scarcity actually jacked up the prices.
[01:02:26.935 --> 01:02:27.336]  Of course.
[01:02:27.636 --> 01:02:32.121]  See, you see these people, the neocons go on radio and go, hey, less oil's coming out!
[01:02:32.739 --> 01:02:34.940]  You know, 80-plus percent less than it was before the war.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.921]  Well, I thought it was about oil!
[01:02:38.021 --> 01:02:39.682]  Yes, they were always mad.
[01:02:39.722 --> 01:02:40.942]  Go back to the newspapers in 1990.
[01:02:42.203 --> 01:02:43.483]  They were mad at Saddam.
[01:02:43.523 --> 01:02:45.164]  Remember, over-pumping.
[01:02:45.724 --> 01:02:47.025]  OPEC was mad.
[01:02:47.045 --> 01:02:53.407]  He said, I've got to pay off $34 billion to BCCI, the big money-laundering bank.
[01:02:53.487 --> 01:02:54.608]  All people went to prison that ran it.
[01:02:54.628 --> 01:02:55.408]  The Bushes were involved.
[01:02:55.968 --> 01:02:56.608]  Yeah, I remember.
[01:03:19.344 --> 01:03:21.265]  Oh man, it's all a big scam, isn't it?
[01:03:21.445 --> 01:03:24.906]  It's very sophisticated, yes, and it fools people.
[01:03:25.266 --> 01:03:26.147]  Just like diamonds.
[01:03:26.787 --> 01:03:28.167]  They are on the low level.
[01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:31.429]  They're not even on the higher scale of semi-precious.
[01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:36.091]  They are, basically, have the same value as rhinestones.
[01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:42.333]  But you don't tell the guy that mortgages his house to buy that two-carat for his wife.
[01:03:56.346 --> 01:04:01.831]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.191 --> 01:04:09.838]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.535 --> 01:04:17.578]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.978 --> 01:04:29.423]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.723 --> 01:04:33.385]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.665 --> 01:04:35.626]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.946 --> 01:04:39.788]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.112 --> 01:04:53.893]  Terrorism!
[01:04:54.033 --> 01:04:54.793]  Terrorism!
[01:04:54.893 --> 01:05:00.957]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:05:01.217 --> 01:05:02.819]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:05:03.059 --> 01:05:05.540]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.921 --> 01:05:20.490]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:20.851]  government.
[01:05:21.011 --> 01:05:22.812]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:22.892 --> 01:05:29.093]  This is presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:29.233 --> 01:05:33.714]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[01:05:41.456 --> 01:05:41.716]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:05:54.591 --> 01:05:58.712]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:05:58.952 --> 01:06:00.712]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:06:00.973 --> 01:06:07.254]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:06:07.554 --> 01:06:13.676]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:06:13.916 --> 01:06:15.756]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:06:15.796 --> 01:06:21.861]  It uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[01:06:21.881 --> 01:06:26.646]  The 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:06:26.806 --> 01:06:30.329]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:06:30.629 --> 01:06:34.352]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:06:34.533 --> 01:06:37.075]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:06:37.215 --> 01:06:38.256]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:38.456 --> 01:06:39.377]  We're good to go.
[01:07:16.562 --> 01:07:18.023]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:18.043 --> 01:07:19.543]  Let's continue with your calls.
[01:07:20.004 --> 01:07:22.225]  I've got so many here, I get mixed up.
[01:07:22.265 --> 01:07:22.945]  Who's up first?
[01:07:22.985 --> 01:07:23.625]  Who's up first?
[01:07:26.146 --> 01:07:28.487]  Brendan in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:07:28.607 --> 01:07:29.668]  Welcome to the Airwaves.
[01:07:30.888 --> 01:07:31.168]  Hello, Alex.
[01:07:31.188 --> 01:07:31.989]  How are you doing?
[01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.389]  Good.
[01:07:32.429 --> 01:07:33.269]  Good to have you calling.
[01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:33.890]  What's on your mind?
[01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:40.052]  Well, first, I just wanted to give you an update on the front here.
[01:07:40.332 --> 01:07:44.814]  I just burned my 50th TerrorStorm copy.
[01:07:45.035 --> 01:07:45.435]  Awesome.
[01:07:45.475 --> 01:07:45.995]  Keep it up.
[01:07:46.593 --> 01:07:47.413]  And got that out.
[01:07:47.954 --> 01:07:49.855]  Woke up a couple family members.
[01:07:50.435 --> 01:07:58.919]  It's kind of hard to do, but especially when you have people who have been in the military most of their adult life, it's kind of hard to break them out of that shell.
[01:07:58.939 --> 01:08:13.005]  Well, a lot of them think patriotism is doing whatever the government says, and that they don't understand that foreign corporations basically bought off our government a long time ago, and have been using us, and literally using us up.
[01:08:14.025 --> 01:08:14.606]  Absolutely.
[01:08:14.786 --> 01:08:15.306]  Absolutely.
[01:08:15.834 --> 01:08:20.196]  Well listen, I wanted to ask you about the airport.
[01:08:20.276 --> 01:08:27.439]  I actually work at the big airport here in Atlanta and I saw that story about the shipping of the airport employees.
[01:08:27.859 --> 01:08:28.159]  Yes.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.781]  Is that basically going to start out with
[01:08:33.174 --> 01:08:34.634]  You know, like the federal employees?
[01:08:34.695 --> 01:08:35.435]  Or is that airline?
[01:08:35.455 --> 01:08:36.715]  Because I don't work for the airlines.
[01:08:36.775 --> 01:08:38.476]  Well, see, this is the point we've gotten to.
[01:08:38.996 --> 01:08:40.977]  That came out last week on television.
[01:08:41.537 --> 01:08:45.338]  We have a local TV clip saying they may start chipping employees.
[01:08:45.978 --> 01:08:47.639]  And I didn't even play the clip on air.
[01:08:47.759 --> 01:08:48.679]  I sent it to the network.
[01:08:48.699 --> 01:08:51.360]  But I'm so conditioned now that it's acclimated.
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:09:00.743]  I've seen this announced so many times and seen them... I mean, even the conditioning worked on me to where I never even... I mentioned it, but I never covered it in detail.
[01:09:01.623 --> 01:09:08.246]  And I have another article here where they want to put microchips in all the old Alzheimer's patients, poor folks in Florida.
[01:09:08.266 --> 01:09:13.148]  And of course, you know, three years ago they made the Attorney General's employees in Mexico City take it.
[01:09:13.528 --> 01:09:18.410]  They're making government officials take it who work in government buildings in Brazil.
[01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:20.751]  Now, you know, it started three years ago.
[01:09:20.771 --> 01:09:23.252]  Oh, if you want to get in the VIP section, you need a chip.
[01:09:23.312 --> 01:09:26.193]  Now it's, you've got to take a chip to get into the topless bar.
[01:09:26.933 --> 01:09:28.114]  I mean, it's just happening.
[01:09:28.943 --> 01:09:30.784]  And it's absolutely horrible.
[01:09:30.844 --> 01:09:39.448]  In fact, John, remember, I think that was like Thursday or Friday last week, we sent you the TV clip about putting chips in airport employees.
[01:09:39.488 --> 01:09:40.709]  Do you know where that is?
[01:09:40.729 --> 01:09:45.671]  If you go to Infowars.net, Steve Watson wrote an article about it.
[01:09:45.711 --> 01:09:46.952]  It's got chipping in the headline.
[01:09:46.992 --> 01:09:50.213]  I know that news piece is down there in the body.
[01:09:51.294 --> 01:09:52.934]  And I don't know what to say anymore.
[01:09:53.114 --> 01:09:54.015]  I mean, it's just
[01:09:55.154 --> 01:10:15.403]  Well, you know, there was a report that I saw, I think it was from the Verichip, you know, from the company there, last year, when I had forwarded that to some family members, and I just thought it was, you know, it was uncanny that the date of the report, where the company had announced that they were going to go full-scale after FDA approval, on June 6, 2006.
[01:10:15.543 --> 01:10:18.744]  So, of course, it said 666 across.
[01:10:18.784 --> 01:10:20.925]  I just thought that was kind of, you know,
[01:10:21.838 --> 01:10:24.739]  No, it's all a big sick joke to them.
[01:10:24.799 --> 01:10:26.820]  They love it and I appreciate your call.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:30.401]  It's just such a big joke to them.
[01:10:31.141 --> 01:10:39.204]  Type in HR 666 or a bill number, the letter prefix and 666 for your state.
[01:10:40.425 --> 01:10:45.787]  It's never a bill to do with insurance or a bill to do with planting trees or something.
[01:10:45.827 --> 01:10:48.568]  It's always law enforcement or torture
[01:10:49.605 --> 01:10:52.207]  Or secret arrest or some new tax.
[01:10:52.267 --> 01:10:53.788]  And it's always like a little message.
[01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:53.788]  666.
[01:10:55.570 --> 01:10:58.612]  I've seen so many bills and so many press releases.
[01:10:58.632 --> 01:10:59.793]  They love to call it 666.
[01:11:00.934 --> 01:11:02.975]  And it's their little haha joke.
[01:11:03.015 --> 01:11:05.617]  I mean, I've had the CEO of Applied Digital on.
[01:11:05.637 --> 01:11:06.998]  It's really an IBM front company.
[01:11:07.538 --> 01:11:09.700]  I've had their different employees on.
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.841]  I've had their top scientist.
[01:11:11.661 --> 01:11:18.745]  And they say you will submit to the CHIP, and I've had their distributors on, the police chief of Bergen County saying he's going to make everyone take CHIPS.
[01:11:19.365 --> 01:11:22.227]  I mean, these are really scary people.
[01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:33.854]  They've got the CHIP mobile, they go to schools, and they've got the Masons roped in nationwide with the CHIP program to indoctrinate the children to give their DNA samples.
[01:11:35.535 --> 01:11:36.595]  They're not playing games.
[01:11:36.655 --> 01:11:39.857]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rico in Toronto.
[01:11:39.897 --> 01:11:40.958]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:42.260]  Hi Alex.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.240]  Hi.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.041]  Two points that I had.
[01:11:47.021 --> 01:11:56.183]  One was you were speaking a while back about using the driver's license to biometrics to keep information.
[01:11:56.223 --> 01:11:56.503]  I have.
[01:11:56.563 --> 01:11:57.663]  In fact I have a whole section.
[01:11:57.703 --> 01:12:05.704]  In fact I was about to not go to your call because I wanted to get this in and then I thought no I gotta take some calls occasionally and I didn't get to it.
[01:12:05.744 --> 01:12:06.924]  It is next in my stack.
[01:12:07.244 --> 01:12:09.325]  That, that is synchronicity.
[01:12:09.705 --> 01:12:09.985]  Go ahead.
[01:12:10.891 --> 01:12:34.851]  Well, what I was about to say is that basically, I read this a couple days ago in a newspaper in Canada, and they were saying that either you had a passport and that the driver's license was no longer good, and just as a miracle, just by coincidence, the minister was saying, oh well, what we could do is put in the driver's license all the information
[01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:40.514]  And then they could use it at the border to swipe and everything would come up.
[01:12:40.714 --> 01:12:42.015]  Now let me cover it right now.
[01:12:42.376 --> 01:12:44.698]  This is business week today.
[01:12:45.758 --> 01:12:47.960]  Business week today.
[01:12:48.681 --> 01:12:51.803]  Use your driver's license as a debit card.
[01:12:51.823 --> 01:12:53.685]  A startup
[01:12:56.152 --> 01:13:04.316]  promises to save both drivers and gas station owners a bundle at the pump by cutting credit cards out of the payment process.
[01:13:04.376 --> 01:13:08.838]  So, see, they pitch it like it's, oh, a new way to save money.
[01:13:08.918 --> 01:13:10.999]  See how deceptive all of this is?
[01:13:11.019 --> 01:13:23.184]  But they don't tell you that they've had summits in London, England, Chicago, Illinois, USA, Austin, Texas, which we've read the minutes of, where they were five, six, seven years ago, a year ago,
[01:13:23.984 --> 01:13:25.545]  Talking about how to sell it.
[01:13:25.605 --> 01:13:31.789]  I mean, they have public meetings and they go, we'll say it'll save money, we'll say it'll... This is the World ID Card.
[01:13:31.829 --> 01:13:32.950]  Let me explain how this works.
[01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:35.291]  And I don't think I've ever really done this yet, and I should.
[01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:39.354]  And I meant to do this today, and we'll see if we have time to do it before our guest comes on.
[01:13:40.314 --> 01:13:41.275]  Let me put you on hold.
[01:13:41.315 --> 01:13:42.335]  I'm going to explain this.
[01:13:43.716 --> 01:13:46.478]  That must mean I'm supposed to cover this and he just called in about it.
[01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:53.242]  Use your driver's license as a debit card.
[01:13:54.947 --> 01:13:59.488]  It says, Aurora Bizig is a big believer in retailer discount cards.
[01:14:00.048 --> 01:14:06.830]  At her last count, she had a dozen from Sam's Club to nearly every grocery store chain in Central Texas.
[01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:08.271]  That's where I'm sitting.
[01:14:08.731 --> 01:14:09.591]  This is Business Week.
[01:14:10.191 --> 01:14:21.014]  So this March, when the Austin, Texas insurance agent pulled into a gas station for a fill-up and saw a sign promising an additional 10% off a gallon
[01:14:22.805 --> 01:14:26.447]  Ten cents off a gallon for signing up with a new e-payment program.
[01:14:26.827 --> 01:14:27.807]  She was interested.
[01:14:27.847 --> 01:14:29.388]  Folks, do not sign up for this.
[01:14:29.468 --> 01:14:30.489]  What is wrong with you?
[01:14:31.329 --> 01:14:33.410]  You don't get anything for free in this world.
[01:14:34.411 --> 01:14:34.811]  Okay?
[01:14:36.912 --> 01:14:45.436]  She was also pleased to learn that the rollback price program wouldn't require her to add another piece of plastic to her overstuffed wallet.
[01:14:45.456 --> 01:14:45.856]  No.
[01:14:46.116 --> 01:14:49.738]  When they're done with it, you won't be able to use anything but that, you fool.
[01:14:50.838 --> 01:14:51.879]  This is all Pentagon.
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:55.482]  They're not allowed to buy anything in Fallujah but with these cards too!
[01:14:56.183 --> 01:14:56.864]  You fools!
[01:14:58.525 --> 01:15:13.157]  Instead, after entering her driver's license number and bank account information online with a two-year-old company called National Payment Card, she'll be able to pay for gas just by swiping her driver's license linked directly via the existing magnetic strip.
[01:15:13.837 --> 01:15:13.937]  Oh!
[01:15:14.017 --> 01:15:16.800]  It was standardized and built in to her bank account!
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:18.441]  Okay, I'm gonna stop right there.
[01:15:20.023 --> 01:15:26.449]  And it goes on to say all the major grocery store chains, all the big gas stations, they all just magically are announcing it.
[01:15:26.829 --> 01:15:31.514]  Now remember a year ago, and I've asked Paul Watson, who's overworked, and Steve to write an article about this.
[01:15:32.114 --> 01:15:33.495]  Maybe I'll just have to do it.
[01:15:33.555 --> 01:15:36.858]  I mean, I was here until 2 in the morning again working on the film.
[01:15:37.279 --> 01:15:40.702]  I just can't do it all, but then I have this compulsion I need to warn people.
[01:15:45.342 --> 01:15:46.623]  Let me explain how this works.
[01:15:46.743 --> 01:15:49.126]  It was about six years ago, right before 9-11.
[01:15:49.166 --> 01:15:51.488]  It was in several Australian newspapers.
[01:15:51.508 --> 01:15:52.609]  We covered it in detail.
[01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:54.932]  I tried to Google it the other day and couldn't find it because it's so old.
[01:15:55.272 --> 01:15:55.953]  Maybe you can find it.
[01:15:55.973 --> 01:15:58.695]  It was also on the UN website.
[01:15:59.416 --> 01:16:06.283]  And they announced that they had a summit in Australia, I think it was in Sydney, for the World Identification Number and World ID Card.
[01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:18.436]  And they said, we're just going to create a unified debit system database with the same number prefix, standardized, and it's not going to even be your passport or national ID.
[01:16:19.016 --> 01:16:35.025]  You're going to still have those, but it's going to be your driver's license or ID card, standardized with Germany, England, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, it was all the western countries, Japan, China, you name it.
[01:16:37.811 --> 01:16:47.235]  And it's going to be a strip on the back, then they're going to adopt an RFID chip in the face of it, and they adopted the same, like they have the world universal product code.
[01:16:47.255 --> 01:16:48.936]  Well, that's used worldwide now.
[01:16:49.276 --> 01:16:51.237]  Well, they just adopted that it's going to be this number.
[01:16:53.817 --> 01:17:02.164]  And then five years ago, we learned that Wells Fargo and others were just giving debit cards to illegal aliens, and then that was being accepted by police departments.
[01:17:02.964 --> 01:17:12.752]  They had corporate deals that were being accepted by apartment complexes, and I talked to apartment complex heads who had to go to meetings where they were told to accept this.
[01:17:12.832 --> 01:17:15.455]  By fiat, they've already legalized them all, folks!
[01:17:16.656 --> 01:17:19.598]  And then Macente Fox came to Austin, gave an award to the police chief,
[01:17:20.733 --> 01:17:24.055]  And gave an award to the Austin Department and a grant.
[01:17:24.435 --> 01:17:27.537]  I mean, he got the foreign governments paying off the police right in front of everybody.
[01:17:28.038 --> 01:17:29.859]  And he did that in 800 plus other cities.
[01:17:30.359 --> 01:17:31.820]  But he only came to Austin and L.A.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:32.520]  and a few other cities.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:36.123]  He sent representatives and lobbyists from his government and the Justice Department here.
[01:17:36.843 --> 01:17:38.104]  And it's all part of the merger.
[01:17:39.084 --> 01:17:41.486]  It's the same thing with Turkey and the rest of Europe.
[01:17:41.506 --> 01:17:42.787]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:17:43.707 --> 01:17:46.709]  And then just magically, oh, you use your driver's license.
[01:17:46.769 --> 01:17:48.350]  And then see, Neil Bortz comes out and
[01:17:49.286 --> 01:17:58.788]  He tells you about the fair tax, and Senator Gravel tells you about it, and everybody's gotta have it, and the Republican candidates say we all need it, and oh my gosh!
[01:17:59.654 --> 01:18:07.819]  But we can't have cheating with the new sales tax, so we've got to swipe the driver's license to decide which graduated sales bracket you're in.
[01:18:07.859 --> 01:18:11.121]  And then see right there, you've got to swipe the card to buy and sell.
[01:18:11.462 --> 01:18:13.143]  Federal control over every terminal.
[01:18:13.383 --> 01:18:15.224]  It's under international standardization.
[01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:21.108]  Then you hear, oh, there's a trusted traveler, trusted trader, trusted immigrant card.
[01:18:21.268 --> 01:18:23.049]  Any illegal can get it and be legalized.
[01:18:23.309 --> 01:18:24.650]  They've just got to be in the system.
[01:18:25.931 --> 01:18:28.873]  And, oh, their debit card will work.
[01:18:30.094 --> 01:18:33.156]  You see, and then, oh, citizens gotta have it now to have a job.
[01:18:33.396 --> 01:18:35.037]  You gotta make sure you're not illegal.
[01:18:36.358 --> 01:18:37.418]  There's your World ID card right there.
[01:18:37.438 --> 01:18:37.538]  Voila!
[01:18:37.558 --> 01:18:37.678]  Done.
[01:18:37.698 --> 01:18:37.999]  It's here.
[01:18:38.019 --> 01:18:38.819]  World ID card.
[01:18:38.839 --> 01:18:42.061]  And, uh, you'll be swiping them to buy and sell, and your preacher will be telling you it's not the Mark of the Beast.
[01:18:42.081 --> 01:18:52.807]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[01:18:53.373 --> 01:18:56.094]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[01:18:56.554 --> 01:19:02.217]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[01:19:02.697 --> 01:19:04.838]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[01:19:05.018 --> 01:19:14.222]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[01:19:14.522 --> 01:19:15.763]  With more than 500 vital functions,

[01:19:54.861 --> 01:19:58.527]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:19:58.928 --> 01:20:04.356]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:20:04.817 --> 01:20:05.898]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:20:05.938 --> 01:20:09.985]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:20:10.625 --> 01:20:23.930]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.

[01:23:03.447 --> 01:23:08.272]  In 1914 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[01:23:08.312 --> 01:23:13.697]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[01:23:13.737 --> 01:23:16.219]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:18.882]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[01:23:18.942 --> 01:23:24.167]  We fired once more and they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:23:27.717 --> 01:23:48.634]  We walked down a river and we see'd the British come And there must have been a hundred of them beatin' on the drum They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they began to runnin' On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[01:23:52.833 --> 01:23:54.534]  Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes!
[01:23:54.554 --> 01:23:54.994]  Welcome back!
[01:23:55.014 --> 01:23:56.475]  Alright, let's go back to Rico in Toronto.
[01:24:18.739 --> 01:24:20.800]  Did that elaborate on things for you, sir?
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.963]  It's a world ID card already standardized.
[01:24:24.263 --> 01:24:26.385]  It's not the North American ID cards coming.
[01:24:26.445 --> 01:24:28.586]  It's not the American or Canadians coming.
[01:24:28.867 --> 01:24:29.947]  It's all standardized.
[01:24:30.007 --> 01:24:31.509]  It's all happening right now.
[01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:34.411]  That was very clear.
[01:24:34.811 --> 01:24:36.853]  And my second point was this.
[01:24:39.695 --> 01:24:45.479]  People always talk about how they're surprised that the government can be bad.
[01:24:47.219 --> 01:24:56.344]  I don't understand how they justify this in their mind, because... They never picked up the most exciting reading around, better than any action-adventure fiction.
[01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:58.225]  They never picked up a history book, brother.
[01:24:58.786 --> 01:25:15.295]  That's right, because if you look at it through history, and even if you look at the Bible just as a history book, nobody, nobody has killed more people under one man as a king rat, or a regime, than any serial killer
[01:25:15.837 --> 01:25:17.358]  Any mass murderer in government.
[01:25:17.958 --> 01:25:19.479]  That's what the founding fathers said.
[01:25:19.519 --> 01:25:21.199]  Hey, this thing is bad.
[01:25:21.259 --> 01:25:23.300]  Let's keep it real small and tie its hands.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:29.483]  But somehow Americans, Canadians, everybody decided, oh, we'll just trust them and let them do whatever they want in the dark.
[01:25:29.803 --> 01:25:33.244]  I mean, if you try to keep control of government in the light, it's hard.
[01:25:33.725 --> 01:25:38.347]  You know, it's a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[01:25:38.947 --> 01:25:40.707]  And boy, we got a fearful master now.
[01:25:40.727 --> 01:25:44.189]  Lula made two points.
[01:25:45.982 --> 01:25:46.742]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:25:47.563 --> 01:25:48.863]  You say you have two points, or you're done?
[01:25:48.883 --> 01:25:49.563]  No, no.
[01:25:49.583 --> 01:25:51.044]  That's it.
[01:25:51.284 --> 01:25:51.744]  Well, thank you.
[01:25:51.764 --> 01:25:52.664]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[01:25:53.464 --> 01:26:02.187]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in New York, who I'm told is with WeAreChange.org.
[01:26:02.327 --> 01:26:05.028]  Luke Radowski on the front lines of the info war.
[01:26:05.328 --> 01:26:06.328]  What's on your mind, my friend?
[01:26:06.348 --> 01:26:07.909]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:26:08.189 --> 01:26:08.389]  Good.
[01:26:09.502 --> 01:26:13.644]  I just wanted to tell your listeners about a new feature we're going to be working on at WeAreChange.org.
[01:26:13.704 --> 01:26:16.285]  We're going to call it, Confront the Guilty.
[01:26:16.725 --> 01:26:32.052]  And basically what's going to happen, when you click on this link, it's going to give you a list of the 50 states, and you click on your state, and it'll give you the who, what, when, and where for the truth squads to head out to and confront the people who are trying to enslave us.
[01:26:33.272 --> 01:26:33.693]  Excellent!
[01:26:33.873 --> 01:26:34.633]  Go ahead and give it out.
[01:26:35.539 --> 01:26:48.953]  Um, so, you could email us, um, you know, leave Luke alone, he's got enough on his plate, so you could email Dan at WeAreChange.org, or Rob at WeAreChange.org, uh, give us about another week or two, this should be up.
[01:26:49.374 --> 01:26:51.896]  Good, uh, anything on your, uh, my Newswiser?
[01:26:52.397 --> 01:26:53.418]  Anything going on in New York?
[01:26:54.366 --> 01:26:55.487]  Uh, no, not right now.
[01:26:55.507 --> 01:26:57.730]  Um, I just wanted to give a little tidbit.
[01:26:57.771 --> 01:27:08.226]  I had read something in one of the local papers here that I thought was interesting on Ron Paul, where one of the guys was talking about Giuliani's attack on Ron Paul, where he had
[01:27:09.487 --> 01:27:09.887]  I hear you.
[01:27:09.907 --> 01:27:11.829]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[01:27:11.869 --> 01:27:12.109]  Keep it up.
[01:27:34.922 --> 01:27:36.444]  Let me just comment on this to be clear.
[01:27:36.485 --> 01:27:39.288]  I did it last hour with the campaign chairman for Ron Paul on.
[01:27:39.529 --> 01:27:41.151]  If you really listen to what Ron Paul said...
[01:27:41.954 --> 01:27:45.096]  He said they are attacking us because we're over there.
[01:27:45.656 --> 01:27:47.318]  And by that he means the war.
[01:27:47.798 --> 01:27:52.681]  He means the people, the insurgency, the resistance is what it is.
[01:27:53.141 --> 01:27:56.684]  And they try to call the Shiites Al-Qaeda, which that's the opposite group.
[01:27:57.064 --> 01:27:58.465]  Even if you believe Al-Qaeda is real.
[01:27:58.845 --> 01:28:02.007]  They call anybody that fights them, anybody that resists them, Al-Qaeda.
[01:28:02.247 --> 01:28:07.111]  Because they don't want to give them the legitimacy of what they really are, occupied people fighting back.
[01:28:07.571 --> 01:28:09.412]  I mean Al-Qaeda, the Sunnis,
[01:28:11.233 --> 01:28:20.144]  The Wahhabis are a very, very tiny, tiny group in Iraq.
[01:28:21.325 --> 01:28:26.471]  And when Ron Paul says that when we're over there it does stimulate hatred and resistance, that's true.
[01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:30.576]  Now, he's on record on this show saying our government stages terror attacks.
[01:28:31.994 --> 01:28:34.155]  I'm surprised the media hadn't picked up on that yet.
[01:28:34.515 --> 01:28:36.616]  Well, they'd love to have a heyday with that little tidbit.
[01:28:37.036 --> 01:28:39.777]  But you'll find out that's a popular view as well, and it's the truth.
[01:28:40.398 --> 01:28:42.398]  So Ron Paul is playing some politics here.
[01:28:42.418 --> 01:28:43.479]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.799 --> 01:28:44.699]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.780]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.721 --> 01:28:50.402]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:00.763]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.

[01:30:57.050 --> 01:31:00.671]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[01:31:01.311 --> 01:31:05.192]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[01:31:05.892 --> 01:31:14.455]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[01:31:15.422 --> 01:31:22.625]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.

[01:32:55.339 --> 01:32:59.021]  The website is www.researchtoherbs.com or 1-800-845-3841 and they have one of the oldest, been around since the 50's,
[01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:04.745]  I think so.

[01:33:44.942 --> 01:33:48.964]  Also my friends, I have made 15 documentary films.

[01:34:11.721 --> 01:34:14.443]  And you can still buy it at Amazon.com, but they're almost sold out.
[01:34:14.483 --> 01:34:17.346]  You don't get a signed copy with them, but you do save a couple dollars.
[01:34:17.746 --> 01:34:20.589]  So get it at Amazon.com unsigned, or get it signed.
[01:34:20.649 --> 01:34:23.531]  Every copy that goes out at Infowars.com.
[01:34:23.551 --> 01:34:24.712]  When they're gone, they're gone.

[01:34:49.359 --> 01:34:50.360]  A powerhouse film.
[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:56.261]  It's in-depth, but it's also a great primer for people that have never been introduced to the real world.
[01:34:56.761 --> 01:34:58.022]  America Freedom to Fascism.

[01:35:33.312 --> 01:35:37.116]  You know, I keep meaning to carry it in the bookstore, but we haven't yet.
[01:35:37.136 --> 01:35:38.477]  I'm going to make that deal this week.
[01:35:38.997 --> 01:35:39.578]  He just sent me...
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:42.341]  Four copies of the paperback.
[01:35:42.381 --> 01:35:42.921]  I got them.
[01:35:43.481 --> 01:35:44.021]  The hardback.
[01:35:44.081 --> 01:35:44.562]  I did read it.
[01:35:44.622 --> 01:35:45.322]  It's excellent.
[01:35:45.522 --> 01:35:46.523]  Armed Madhouse.
[01:35:47.123 --> 01:35:49.684]  He also is a best-selling author of The Best Democracy Money Can Buy.
[01:35:50.264 --> 01:35:51.545]  And he is Greg Powell's.
[01:35:51.585 --> 01:35:52.685]  But it's available everywhere.
[01:35:52.745 --> 01:35:53.866]  Store shelves nationwide.
[01:35:54.366 --> 01:35:55.746]  And, of course, at Amazon.com.
[01:35:56.167 --> 01:35:58.688]  Not available at Infowars.com yet, but it will soon.
[01:35:58.728 --> 01:35:59.288]  I'm going to do that.
[01:35:59.828 --> 01:36:00.128]  I'm in the U.S.
[01:36:00.148 --> 01:36:03.730]  about to skedaddle back to BBC London in a week or so after I do some filming
[01:36:25.161 --> 01:36:28.913]  Under the skirts of the Washingtonians next week.
[01:36:28.933 --> 01:36:30.217]  So I'll be in Washington filming.
[01:36:30.831 --> 01:36:33.353]  Then back to London for BBC Television.
[01:36:33.493 --> 01:36:38.756]  Greg, they say everything's accelerating from technology development to our daily lives.
[01:36:39.116 --> 01:36:40.497]  It's just exponential.
[01:36:40.937 --> 01:36:44.179]  And it looks like we're starting to really see the decline of Rome here.
[01:36:44.739 --> 01:36:47.981]  And I feel, I'm scared we all may be squashed as it falls.
[01:36:48.382 --> 01:36:53.985]  Open discussions now of super-inflation, super-recession, or maybe even depression.
[01:36:54.906 --> 01:36:58.708]  Open borders, NAFTA and GATT, roosters coming home to roost.
[01:37:00.469 --> 01:37:02.670]  I mean, just shotgun it.
[01:37:02.711 --> 01:37:03.531]  Tell us what's going on.
[01:37:03.891 --> 01:37:09.535]  Okay, well, I'm actually in a good mood because I think that the pus is finally breaking through the skin.
[01:37:10.115 --> 01:37:13.198]  Frankly, the media can't keep the blackout going forever.
[01:37:13.258 --> 01:37:13.678]  No, I agree.
[01:37:13.698 --> 01:37:15.119]  We're starting to lance it.
[01:37:15.159 --> 01:37:15.959]  Lance the wound.
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:16.680]  That's right.
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:20.202]  I mean, you know, in fact, I can't make this up, by the way, Alex.
[01:37:20.302 --> 01:37:27.087]  Karl Rove wrote a review of Armed Madhouse, and that review, I can't make it up, was subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee.
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:30.322]  Because it was evidence in the prosecutor gate, firing.
[01:37:30.342 --> 01:37:35.545]  So what he was saying is, thank God, and the road bosses are saying, thank God, the U.S.
[01:37:35.665 --> 01:37:37.566]  media has not, no U.S.
[01:37:37.586 --> 01:37:43.289]  national media has picked up the investigations of that British reporter, Greg Pallast, in armed madhouse.
[01:37:43.309 --> 01:37:45.210]  They even include a little excerpt PDF.
[01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:48.192]  Is he that arrogant to put that out, or how did you, where were it?
[01:37:48.232 --> 01:37:53.495]  Well, they subpoenaed it, and now why was it part of the prosecutor subpoena was because
[01:37:53.835 --> 01:38:05.007]  One of the things that they didn't want you to see was that, you know, Karl Rove says that there's 500 emails that they can't find because he used Republican Party computers, and golly gee, the computers were maintained and cleaned.
[01:38:05.267 --> 01:38:06.549]  Well, guess what, Karl?
[01:38:06.909 --> 01:38:08.591]  He knows that I've got 500 of them.
[01:38:10.132 --> 01:38:16.099]  And they are enough to send Carl and the gang up the river from here to Kingdom Come.
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:18.602]  So they're looking for the emails Greg Pallas has got them?
[01:38:18.763 --> 01:38:19.243]  Yeah, of course.
[01:38:19.263 --> 01:38:20.685]  That's why I do investigative reporting.
[01:38:20.705 --> 01:38:24.349]  But as you know, that's why I do it from England, because here's against Patriot Act 3.
[01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:25.731]  So what's happened is...
[01:38:25.871 --> 01:38:27.072]  Oh, by the way, I want to stop you.
[01:38:27.092 --> 01:38:33.577]  They actually issued an order to arrest you under Homeland Security for showing a FEMA camp down on the Gulf Coast.
[01:38:33.617 --> 01:38:39.742]  That was actually in mainstream news, folks, and only when you were doing work for ABC did their intervention keep you from being arrested.
[01:38:39.982 --> 01:38:41.463]  That's how close we are, folks.
[01:38:41.483 --> 01:38:47.648]  When they get up on Fox News and call for my arrest and everybody else's arrest, they're not playing games.
[01:38:47.688 --> 01:38:49.850]  Yeah, I was charged under the Patriot Act.
[01:38:50.250 --> 01:38:53.253]  I was joking before about investigative reporting being illegal.
[01:38:53.313 --> 01:38:54.934]  I thought it was a joke until I was charged.
[01:38:55.236 --> 01:38:56.917]  By the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:38:57.517 --> 01:38:59.639]  And, you know, this was not about national security.
[01:38:59.979 --> 01:39:03.041]  This was about political image security.
[01:39:03.541 --> 01:39:04.261]  I was filming.
[01:39:04.361 --> 01:39:12.346]  We still have 89,000 people living in tin cans in the tin can Guantanamo there in the swampland.
[01:39:12.366 --> 01:39:13.186]  89,000 families, right?
[01:39:13.407 --> 01:39:16.308]  They say we can't find unskilled workers or workers that do jobs.
[01:39:16.708 --> 01:39:20.991]  How about issuing visas to people in the Katrina camp?
[01:39:21.631 --> 01:39:21.871]  89,000 people.
[01:39:21.891 --> 01:39:23.652]  Maybe they can be given work permits.
[01:39:23.672 --> 01:39:24.493]  What do you think, Alex?
[01:39:25.163 --> 01:39:30.066]  No, Halliburton now has moved to Dubai and literally brought in 300,000 illegal aliens to do it.
[01:39:30.166 --> 01:39:39.992]  Well, so what happened is that now I was filming there and I was filming, I was showing it, we were sticking people in a place called Cancer Alley right under the Exxon smokestacks.
[01:39:40.692 --> 01:39:41.413]  I filmed it.
[01:39:41.693 --> 01:39:52.539]  They brought criminal charges against me and what happened was, by the way, they didn't arrest me as Washington Journal reported because they couldn't find me.
[01:39:52.919 --> 01:39:53.600]  Okay, Alex,
[01:39:54.298 --> 01:39:56.261]  These are the guys looking for Osama Bin Laden.
[01:39:56.382 --> 01:39:57.544]  I'm on television!
[01:40:01.953 --> 01:40:09.678]  By the way, that's why I expanded our mass with three new chapters, including what busted about this bus and what they didn't want you to see and know about.
[01:40:11.179 --> 01:40:13.661]  By the way, I asked them, I said, what is the charge?
[01:40:13.701 --> 01:40:14.661]  I finally called them.
[01:40:14.721 --> 01:40:16.803]  You violated infrastructure protection.
[01:40:17.063 --> 01:40:19.344]  They say you can't release anything on a toxic spill.
[01:40:19.605 --> 01:40:22.467]  You can't show any highways or factories.
[01:40:22.927 --> 01:40:25.148]  So what I had was, I said, I was filming critical infrastructure.
[01:40:25.168 --> 01:40:27.050]  I said, how do you know it's critical infrastructure?
[01:40:27.090 --> 01:40:30.212]  The Exxon plant and the FEMA camp, which are part of Homeland Security.
[01:40:30.732 --> 01:40:33.593]  Well, any major polluting facility owned by a Bush donor.
[01:40:34.213 --> 01:40:35.694]  No, that wouldn't happen.
[01:40:35.914 --> 01:40:38.655]  It's like, no, this is what they don't want you to film.
[01:40:38.695 --> 01:40:41.536]  Look, Osama to stop looking at my films to target things.
[01:40:41.676 --> 01:40:42.696]  Use a Google map.
[01:40:42.756 --> 01:40:43.597]  You know, come on, guys.
[01:40:44.197 --> 01:40:47.118]  This is all, again, not about protecting us.
[01:40:47.685 --> 01:40:51.888]  By the way, this is a gigantic, one of the biggest refinery complexes in North America.
[01:40:51.908 --> 01:40:54.690]  I mean, it's not like you don't know where the refineries are.
[01:40:54.710 --> 01:40:57.032]  Drive to the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:40:57.052 --> 01:41:02.336]  But they don't want you showing that they put the trailers right there in the toxic plume.
[01:41:02.696 --> 01:41:03.537]  It is ugly.
[01:41:03.897 --> 01:41:08.020]  And then on top of it, right, so we got that story.
[01:41:08.777 --> 01:41:10.058]  It's coming out no matter what.
[01:41:10.439 --> 01:41:18.887]  I've got Monica Goodling testifying yesterday about what Rove is gloating that our madhouse won't expose it.
[01:41:18.947 --> 01:41:20.168]  I'm sorry I interrupted you.
[01:41:20.208 --> 01:41:21.489]  Go into that.
[01:41:21.529 --> 01:41:23.732]  Because usually I call you to come on.
[01:41:23.792 --> 01:41:25.073]  I was wondering why is Greg calling me.
[01:41:25.113 --> 01:41:26.895]  I should have gotten you.
[01:41:26.915 --> 01:41:27.635]  This is huge.
[01:41:27.695 --> 01:41:28.216]  No wonder.
[01:41:29.077 --> 01:41:30.618]  This is being blacked out.
[01:41:30.959 --> 01:41:32.060]  Do you have 500?
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:33.401]  Do you have the emails?
[01:41:33.741 --> 01:41:48.393]  Right, and just on top of the BBC Nightly News, we have the emails, we showed them, and the reason that they said they're gone is that, in fact, the one I have reproduced in our madhouse is basically involves something called caging lists.
[01:41:48.513 --> 01:41:55.378]  And Monica Goodling opened up her testimony yesterday and said, look, they lied, they perjured themselves saying they knew nothing about the caging lists.
[01:41:55.999 --> 01:41:58.782]  And there wasn't one congressman who said, what the heck are caging lists?
[01:41:59.142 --> 01:42:00.243]  Why are you saying this?
[01:42:00.303 --> 01:42:02.165]  Why are they perjuring themselves about it?
[01:42:02.185 --> 01:42:09.011]  The answer is, caging lists are lists of voters that they illegally challenged on their right to vote.
[01:42:09.051 --> 01:42:12.575]  And you know what the number one group of voters was that they challenged, Alex?
[01:42:13.295 --> 01:42:14.356]  Let me guess, blacks.
[01:42:14.897 --> 01:42:18.040]  Well, not just any blacks, soldiers.
[01:42:18.610 --> 01:42:20.331]  Soldiers sent overseas.
[01:42:20.572 --> 01:42:24.114]  I've got their addresses, like this naval airman, Randy Prousa.
[01:42:24.354 --> 01:42:26.036]  He sent overseas.
[01:42:26.176 --> 01:42:30.179]  What they did was they sent letters to the soldiers' homes where they're registered to vote.
[01:42:30.439 --> 01:42:31.560]  The letters come back.
[01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:32.781]  That's called caged.
[01:42:33.181 --> 01:42:37.564]  When the caged letters, they piled them up, 70,000 in Florida alone.
[01:42:39.946 --> 01:42:47.872]  When the soldiers' vote came back from overseas, they would say, those voters voted from a suspect address, like Baghdad, right?
[01:42:48.416 --> 01:42:51.720]  Because they're not voting from... We have a letter showing that they don't live at home.
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:52.541]  Well, of course they don't!
[01:42:52.581 --> 01:42:54.143]  The President sent them overseas!
[01:42:56.221 --> 01:43:04.706]  And they know that over 70% of the troops in Gallup polls are against the war, so they just black out all of the black military.
[01:43:05.826 --> 01:43:12.170]  All the military, because what's happening is that the anger there... The military shouldn't be, they may be with Al-Qaeda!
[01:43:12.690 --> 01:43:13.730]  And you know what, here's the thing.
[01:43:14.131 --> 01:43:15.571]  They don't want those guys to vote.
[01:43:16.012 --> 01:43:16.352]  At all.
[01:43:16.492 --> 01:43:18.553]  And so they were secretly challenging their votes.
[01:43:19.093 --> 01:43:22.855]  No one, imagine challenging the votes of active duty soldiers over here.
[01:43:22.875 --> 01:43:23.896]  Because they may be with Al-Qaeda.
[01:43:26.011 --> 01:43:27.311]  If this keeps up, they may be!
[01:43:27.652 --> 01:43:31.493]  And so what's happened is that they, you know, no one asked about this.
[01:43:31.733 --> 01:43:37.054]  And by the way, I had a voting rights attorney, Bobby Kennedy Jr., went through the BBC evidence and the emails.
[01:43:37.074 --> 01:43:39.315]  He said, my God, these people shouldn't be in office.
[01:43:39.335 --> 01:43:41.515]  They should all be in prison, all the way up and down the line.
[01:43:41.915 --> 01:43:43.736]  No, Bush isn't, lad!
[01:43:44.685 --> 01:43:48.350]  And he said, this isn't just some creepy, horrible thing.
[01:43:48.391 --> 01:43:49.893]  It's not just creepy to attack soldiers.
[01:43:50.153 --> 01:43:50.994]  It's against the law.
[01:43:51.034 --> 01:43:51.755]  You can't do this.
[01:43:52.016 --> 01:43:53.177]  It's a felony crime.
[01:43:53.498 --> 01:43:56.082]  And what Goodling was saying was... Wait a minute.
[01:43:56.102 --> 01:43:57.083]  They love the soldiers.
[01:43:57.143 --> 01:43:57.984]  Fox News told me.
[01:43:58.004 --> 01:43:58.485]  Oh yeah, I know.
[01:43:58.505 --> 01:43:59.286]  They love the soldiers.
[01:43:59.306 --> 01:44:00.288]  They want to send them to chocolate.
[01:44:00.308 --> 01:44:01.009]  How about sending them home?
[01:44:01.777 --> 01:44:04.838]  Some of those guys are trying to sneak in those chocolate boxes.
[01:44:05.398 --> 01:44:08.739]  Yeah, they love them so much that they want to send more of them, right?
[01:44:08.839 --> 01:44:14.060]  The one way to express your love is to stick someone under a tank, under army infusion.
[01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:16.561]  I mean, I just talked to a friend of mine who's going over.
[01:44:16.881 --> 01:44:19.202]  This is like no joke stuff, man.
[01:44:19.682 --> 01:44:27.624]  He's been assigned to be the guy in a squad that follows up after an IED attack, and you know they always attack the second squad.
[01:44:28.044 --> 01:44:28.264]  I mean,
[01:44:28.789 --> 01:44:29.850]  He just had a new baby.
[01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:34.052]  You know, this is really no joke, as we head to Memorial Day, and they're taking away his vote!
[01:44:34.492 --> 01:44:34.792]  Okay?
[01:44:35.533 --> 01:44:36.373]  These guys!
[01:44:36.633 --> 01:44:39.355]  And what happened was, Goodling was saying they committed perjury.
[01:44:39.395 --> 01:44:45.058]  She named Tim Griffin, she named Kyle Stanford, she named Karl Rove, and no one had a word to say!
[01:44:45.078 --> 01:44:49.320]  And so, the rest of the world is saying, doesn't this bother you?
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.041]  It's on the top of the BBC Nightly News.
[01:44:51.061 --> 01:44:52.922]  It's not like we're some pirate radio station here.
[01:44:53.903 --> 01:44:56.844]  We are putting this stuff out, but we can't get it out here.
[01:44:57.284 --> 01:44:58.125]  And like you say,
[01:44:58.809 --> 01:45:04.534]  Look, the evil is kind of spreading, but the information is now leaking.
[01:45:04.935 --> 01:45:05.776]  And that's important.
[01:45:06.196 --> 01:45:07.317]  It's coming out, by the way.
[01:45:07.897 --> 01:45:09.859]  You are the crackin' electronic Berlin Wall.
[01:45:09.879 --> 01:45:16.505]  I'm always thrilled to have you on, because, by the way, just so you know, ABC News turned down the reports from us on the criminality.
[01:45:16.525 --> 01:45:18.888]  Well, thank you for coming on, Greg, and sharing this with us.
[01:45:18.968 --> 01:45:20.349]  We've got to get a little report out.
[01:45:20.589 --> 01:45:26.652]  Yeah, well, what happened is that, just so you know, ABC has the right to run all my BBC television reports for free.
[01:45:26.672 --> 01:45:27.912]  We have a film trading agreement.
[01:45:28.192 --> 01:45:29.373]  And they said, forget it.
[01:45:29.413 --> 01:45:29.753]  No way.
[01:45:29.773 --> 01:45:32.234]  The head of ABC News personally vetoed it.
[01:45:32.494 --> 01:45:34.615]  There is no way that they're going to run these reports.
[01:45:34.955 --> 01:45:36.416]  And so I said, I got to call Alex.
[01:45:36.436 --> 01:45:39.797]  He'll allow me to lob the stuff across the water.
[01:45:40.738 --> 01:45:43.819]  And the other thing is, you've got to look at the whole panoply.
[01:45:44.332 --> 01:45:46.753]  They're going to lie to you about the votes because they lied to you.
[01:45:46.833 --> 01:45:48.353]  And by the way, it's not one party.
[01:45:48.633 --> 01:45:53.655]  I see Al, my good buddy Al Gore, just came out with a new book this week, The Assault on Reason.
[01:45:54.055 --> 01:46:02.638]  Hey, Al, we're talking about the immigrate, we're now talking about an immigration bill because there are 12 million undocumented workers here in the United States.
[01:46:03.058 --> 01:46:03.598]  Excuse me, in 1993,
[01:46:06.505 --> 01:46:15.212]  He got up on national television and said that we will now reduce the number of illegal workers in the United States from two million from Mexico, right?
[01:46:15.573 --> 01:46:16.654]  Because of NAFTA.
[01:46:16.734 --> 01:46:19.496]  It's going to end the brown tie, right?
[01:46:19.616 --> 01:46:28.864]  That was his big claim, that NAFTA would create massive prosperity in Mexico, and therefore they have no reason to leave.
[01:46:28.904 --> 01:46:32.667]  Well, the minimum wage in Mexico is now one-fourth of what it was
[01:46:33.294 --> 01:46:34.254]  Before NAFTA.
[01:46:34.415 --> 01:46:42.778]  Oh, I mean every solution they've got is always actually an accelerant, and then they'll have another solution that accelerates the merger.
[01:46:43.118 --> 01:46:54.723]  And the only way that I see them stopping people crawling across the border to survive is that they're going to make it so grim on this side that we'll want to be escaping over the wall the other way.
[01:46:55.444 --> 01:46:57.865]  And that's what I'm very concerned about.
[01:46:57.905 --> 01:47:01.066]  But I do think that the information is getting out, you're getting it out,
[01:47:01.567 --> 01:47:22.061]  You know, look, they can only control, you know, the New York Pravda Times and the Washington and Vestia post there, but, you know, you're getting out through DVDs, you're getting out through increasing radio presence, the Internet, you know, and I really... You have to understand, I'm about as mainstream as you can get in the rest of the world.
[01:47:22.241 --> 01:47:25.784]  You know, BBC, very stiff upper lip, mainstream.
[01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:29.853]  Press everywhere, but I can't get the stuff in the US and you're letting it in.
[01:47:29.893 --> 01:47:32.315]  I hope people understand how precious and important.
[01:47:33.021 --> 01:47:34.462]  You and your work is.
[01:47:34.622 --> 01:47:35.403]  Well, you're very kind.
[01:47:35.423 --> 01:47:38.746]  We're just doing our duty, but it is exciting to see this happening.
[01:47:38.966 --> 01:47:49.774]  The problem is now, we know that the big telecommunications company spent over $150 million last year trying to regulate the end of net neutrality and to start trying to shut down internet radio.
[01:47:50.014 --> 01:47:55.639]  I mean, they see the threat, not just from me, we're just one little brigade in this alternative media army.
[01:47:55.919 --> 01:47:57.140]  Where do you see that going, Greg?
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:00.861]  Well, I see that you're not going to be a little brigade, otherwise they wouldn't care.
[01:48:01.041 --> 01:48:04.723]  Otherwise they wouldn't spend $100 million trying to beat you into the ground, see?
[01:48:05.223 --> 01:48:08.284]  They don't see this as minor stuff, because you know what's happening?
[01:48:08.304 --> 01:48:15.787]  People are going to say, well, if I want to see your really serious investigative reporting, I can't turn on ABC with some fake hairdos and bleached teeth.
[01:48:16.127 --> 01:48:17.448]  I have to go to Alex Jones!
[01:48:18.128 --> 01:48:20.589]  And people are wising up.
[01:48:21.049 --> 01:48:23.650]  They're learning that it's not scary out there on the internet.
[01:48:23.670 --> 01:48:25.331]  That's where they're going to get the international news.
[01:48:25.351 --> 01:48:26.071]  That's where they're going to get
[01:48:26.576 --> 01:48:27.696]  The hard stuff.
[01:48:28.157 --> 01:48:44.243]  You know, I mean, one of the things I put in our man house that I put on the British TV, you know, that before Katrina, they had, the Bushies had let out a contract for the emergency evacuation.
[01:48:44.263 --> 01:48:46.323]  New Orleans has never been done, never been privatized.
[01:48:47.864 --> 01:48:52.225]  And they said, well, they're going to have this expert, James Lee Witt, on their contract.
[01:48:52.325 --> 01:48:53.646]  Witt says he's never heard of these guys.
[01:48:54.170 --> 01:48:57.031]  Emergency Innovative Emergency Management.
[01:48:57.091 --> 01:49:03.293]  You know what their entire... I asked them, have you ever done emergency planning, ever, anywhere before?
[01:49:03.333 --> 01:49:04.793]  Before you got the New Orleans contract.
[01:49:04.813 --> 01:49:06.314]  The most vulnerable city in America.
[01:49:06.914 --> 01:49:09.695]  And they couldn't name a single place where they've done any work.
[01:49:09.995 --> 01:49:12.976]  And then I pull out three pages of donations to the politicians.
[01:49:13.316 --> 01:49:20.538]  And by the way... Well let me ask you this question before we go to break, and then come back and talk about oil prices in Venezuela and everything that's happening with the war and what you see happening.
[01:49:20.598 --> 01:49:23.719]  And Greg Ballast, BBC reporter, also a reporter for the London Guardian,
[01:49:24.921 --> 01:49:27.904]  Well, when we get back, the first question is, how far is this going to go?
[01:49:28.624 --> 01:49:31.367]  Because, and what is the mindset in the White House?
[01:49:31.407 --> 01:49:46.541]  Because they think they're invincible, and they've just gone even further than I thought they could, and it just seems like they want to get caught, and then where do you see this going with the elections, Ron Paul, or are we just going to end up with Hillary Clinton and then it won't matter, they'll just pass the baton?
[01:49:46.961 --> 01:49:51.245]  Greg Palast is our guest, we have a link to his website up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:49:56.585 --> 01:50:02.074]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.414 --> 01:50:10.026]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.754 --> 01:50:17.819]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.219 --> 01:50:29.686]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.946 --> 01:50:33.489]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.909 --> 01:50:35.830]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.170 --> 01:50:40.033]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.499 --> 01:50:58.722]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.862 --> 01:51:06.967]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.227 --> 01:51:14.271]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.451 --> 01:51:15.712]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:51:15.812 --> 01:51:21.716]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.896 --> 01:51:26.980]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:35.986]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.246 --> 01:51:43.110]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at
[01:51:44.651 --> 01:51:54.979]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.199 --> 01:51:58.901]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.221 --> 01:52:08.168]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.308 --> 01:52:13.211]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.411 --> 01:52:22.422]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[01:52:22.762 --> 01:52:28.769]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:00.222]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:00.702 --> 01:53:03.564]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:09.408]  Bush is rattling sabers again to attack Iran.
[01:53:11.230 --> 01:53:13.592]  Got a ton of police state news, election news.
[01:53:14.192 --> 01:53:15.433]  It's all coming up in the next hour.
[01:53:15.453 --> 01:53:18.055]  We'll also have open phones for those that are still holding.
[01:53:20.097 --> 01:53:21.818]  Here's the toll-free number if you'd like to join us.
[01:53:21.838 --> 01:53:21.898]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:26.519 --> 01:53:39.428]  Greg, in the four or five minutes we've got left here, Greg Palast, BBC, London Guardian, can you get into air, can you get into it on air, how you got the White House emails, or do you want to not tell people about that?
[01:53:39.608 --> 01:53:42.650]  No, that's fine, I didn't put it in our Mad House, because it's almost a bad joke.
[01:53:42.690 --> 01:53:48.413]  People think that Karl Rove is an evil genius, but in fact, you know... So this is in the new edition?
[01:53:48.493 --> 01:53:55.078]  Yeah, in the new edition of our Mad House, and from Baghdad to New Orleans, and you know,
[01:53:56.013 --> 01:54:01.615]  What he did was, he and the Rovebots, they're not the sharpest knives in the drawer, they misaddressed their emails.
[01:54:01.635 --> 01:54:06.176]  So what we do is, well they have a domain name, several, like georgewbush.com.
[01:54:06.456 --> 01:54:09.477]  We set up similar names, like georgewbush.org.
[01:54:09.717 --> 01:54:18.580]  If they like, you know, not thinking, type in org instead of com, boom, it goes right into our domain of friends who control this stuff.
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:19.660]  It goes right back
[01:54:20.313 --> 01:54:21.474]  To us at BBC.
[01:54:21.774 --> 01:54:27.999]  Now, if it were love letters or campaign strategy or something, we would, you know, I'm not going to open it up.
[01:54:28.039 --> 01:54:31.062]  I'm not going to go through it or I'm going to delete it.
[01:54:31.622 --> 01:54:36.566]  But if we find evidence of criminality, my network says, you put it on the air.
[01:54:36.606 --> 01:54:39.568]  What we found was enough to put these guys away.
[01:54:39.588 --> 01:54:43.992]  And Goodling was trying to explain that to the committee yesterday and they were ignoring her.
[01:54:44.827 --> 01:54:49.269]  That's why she wanted immunity, because she thought, man, I'm involved in this, I'm going to go up the river too!
[01:54:49.289 --> 01:54:52.251]  Because people were saying, why did she ask for immunity?
[01:54:52.311 --> 01:54:53.851]  What type of things are in the emails?
[01:54:54.051 --> 01:54:57.373]  Okay, the main thing is the schemes to steal the election.
[01:54:57.833 --> 01:55:01.015]  Things like knocking off black voters, caging lists.
[01:55:01.795 --> 01:55:03.696]  We had 50 on the caging list.
[01:55:04.056 --> 01:55:07.198]  That's the main thing that they were doing, and it goes back to the U.S.
[01:55:07.258 --> 01:55:07.978]  prosecutors.
[01:55:08.038 --> 01:55:11.840]  Just so you know, I just spoke, I've had several conversations with David Iglesias
[01:55:12.475 --> 01:55:13.455]  The fired prosecutor.
[01:55:13.495 --> 01:55:28.522]  He confirmed, and I have some of this in our matter, speaking to his committee, to his office, they wanted to bring false prosecutions against the so-called fraudulent voters when, while they were in the process of actually illegally manipulating the election themselves.
[01:55:28.862 --> 01:55:36.566]  Now, the guy is a very conservative Republican, an Ashcroft protege, but it was basically the line in the sand that he wasn't going to cross.
[01:55:37.307 --> 01:55:38.488]  He just couldn't do that.
[01:55:39.649 --> 01:55:46.675]  Well, that's going to be their problem, is that as government gets more and more corrupt, they're trying to recruit criminals, but there's just too many good people.
[01:55:47.055 --> 01:55:47.916]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:55:48.316 --> 01:55:54.421]  That's exactly what Monica was trying to get across yesterday, and what I reported, put in our manifesto, put on top of the BBC.
[01:55:54.441 --> 01:56:02.908]  If you go to the caging letters, to the emails, one of which is in the book, it actually says that the caging list operation was headed
[01:56:03.766 --> 01:56:07.548]  Under Roe's direction, but headed by a guy named Tim Griffin.
[01:56:08.048 --> 01:56:09.769]  What is Tim Griffin's job today?
[01:56:09.789 --> 01:56:11.749]  He's U.S.
[01:56:11.989 --> 01:56:13.290]  Attorney for Arkansas.
[01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:21.253]  See, when they fired the honest attorneys, they put in this guy who was committing the vote theft, directing it.
[01:56:21.353 --> 01:56:24.595]  In other words, the perpetrators become the prosecutors.
[01:56:25.035 --> 01:56:29.817]  They're looking at the guys who were fired, and they say, with their politics and their removal, that ain't nothing.
[01:56:30.208 --> 01:56:31.548]  Look at their replacements.
[01:56:31.868 --> 01:56:33.669]  These replacements are robots.
[01:56:33.949 --> 01:56:41.871]  They are basically a sleeper cell of anti-constitutional terrorists that are going to explode on us in November 2008.
[01:56:41.971 --> 01:56:45.211]  Well, look at Alberto Gonzalez, the Enron lawyer.
[01:56:45.231 --> 01:56:47.392]  Look at John Hughes saying they can torture children.
[01:56:47.752 --> 01:56:50.833]  I mean, they're putting their people in every position of power.
[01:56:51.013 --> 01:56:51.893]  And I've got to tell you something.
[01:56:52.714 --> 01:56:56.358]  You know, so Bobby Kennedy, and I'm going to tell you... We're out of time.
[01:56:56.438 --> 01:56:57.239]  I've got to ask you this.
[01:56:57.279 --> 01:56:58.340]  What about the martial law?
[01:56:58.660 --> 01:57:00.502]  Bush now declaring himself emperor.
[01:57:01.263 --> 01:57:02.664]  Well, you know what?
[01:57:03.285 --> 01:57:04.866]  He's going to do it whether he declares it or not.
[01:57:05.407 --> 01:57:07.128]  What doesn't he get away with?
[01:57:07.148 --> 01:57:08.890]  Do you think he may try to stay in office?
[01:57:09.731 --> 01:57:11.193]  Nah, they're going to put in a new glove puppet.
[01:57:13.829 --> 01:57:14.809]  It just won't be any better.
[01:57:15.029 --> 01:57:16.930]  So they're just going to change horses and put electrics in?
[01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:19.810]  They're going to put on a new, snap on a new head on the robot.
[01:57:20.170 --> 01:57:20.310]  Yep.
[01:57:20.610 --> 01:57:24.631]  You'll have to tell us on another interview, because you've got to go do another one about Bobby Kennedy.
[01:57:24.851 --> 01:57:26.271]  Listen, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:57:27.892 --> 01:57:30.132]  There goes Greg Palast from our madhouse.
[01:57:30.192 --> 01:57:31.132]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:57:33.353 --> 01:57:37.933]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.842 --> 01:57:50.483]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.143 --> 01:57:52.203]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.923 --> 01:57:54.023]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.683 --> 01:57:55.504]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.244 --> 01:57:57.124]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.144 --> 01:58:01.765]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.985 --> 01:58:06.106]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.507 --> 01:58:12.508]  I've got all this really incredible news here in front of me, but you've been holding long enough.
[01:58:12.528 --> 01:58:13.808]  Let's take a bunch of calls and I'll
[01:58:16.098 --> 01:58:22.701]  Get into the Bush White House, openly wanting to escalate covert operations against Iran that could trigger off a war.
[01:58:23.561 --> 01:58:27.303]  Open discussions of Bush now being an official dictator, that's mainstream news.
[01:58:29.484 --> 01:58:33.526]  Right now, David in Milwaukee, then Charles, John, Alex, and others.
[01:58:33.946 --> 01:58:35.306]  Go ahead, David, you're on the air.
[01:58:35.326 --> 01:58:37.007]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:58:37.127 --> 01:58:37.527]  Good, sir.
[01:58:38.628 --> 01:58:40.449]  I'm a big fan of yours.
[01:58:40.549 --> 01:58:45.551]  I got into you after I found out that you interviewed George Galloway.
[01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:47.641]  Do you remember him?
[01:58:47.801 --> 01:58:49.202]  Yes, I've interviewed him a couple times.
[01:58:49.302 --> 01:58:50.002]  Member of Parliament.
[01:58:50.582 --> 01:58:51.983]  He's from Scotland.
[01:58:52.023 --> 01:58:52.784]  That's where I'm from.
[01:58:54.425 --> 01:58:58.767]  I'm worried about the US attacking Iran.
[01:58:59.348 --> 01:59:04.951]  I think it could be a real... I mean, I can't understand why people aren't more scared about it.
[01:59:05.512 --> 01:59:06.853]  Because it's incredible.
[01:59:06.993 --> 01:59:07.994]  It's conditioning, sir.
[01:59:08.374 --> 01:59:09.696]  Look, they know that it acclimates.
[01:59:09.716 --> 01:59:12.298]  They're using basic psychological formula.
[01:59:12.698 --> 01:59:13.619]  Okay, formulae.
[01:59:14.119 --> 01:59:21.406]  What they do is, they just, like with Iraq, they talk about attacking them for two years, and even if you're against it, it's almost like a foregone conclusion.
[01:59:21.426 --> 01:59:27.571]  You've heard about it so much, at a subconscious level, you want to go ahead and see it at your bestial, kind of id level.
[01:59:28.275 --> 01:59:30.578]  Exactly, but it's the same thing.
[01:59:30.598 --> 01:59:31.879]  Let me just finish though, this is key.
[01:59:31.899 --> 01:59:33.641]  It's the same thing with microchips.
[01:59:33.941 --> 01:59:41.388]  They talk about it so much now, they're trying to make Alzheimer's patients take it, they're trying to make airport employees take it now, and I'm not even talking about it, I've been conditioned.
[01:59:41.629 --> 01:59:43.611]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:59:43.691 --> 01:59:49.697]  It's exactly the same thing again about Iran having weapons, and that was the exact same thing about Iraq.
[01:59:50.640 --> 02:00:05.608]  And the Middle East is descending into chaos now, and I don't know why... It's simple brainwashing, and of course the Pentagon said, we're going to go in, it's going to cause more revolts, then we'll get to have a bunch of other wars, we're going to problem, reaction, solution, that's public!
[02:00:05.628 --> 02:00:16.653]  I mean, you know, when Ron Paul says they know going over there is going to cause more attacks, because yeah, they may have staged the earlier ones, and they did, 9-11 staged, but it's going to make them have real attacks, which is what the Pentagon wants!
[02:00:16.693 --> 02:00:18.074]  They know exactly what they're doing!
[02:00:18.554 --> 02:00:19.555]  It's cold-blooded, brother!
[02:00:20.885 --> 02:00:32.077]  I know, but I just, I follow European news more, and they do, they do obviously, because of the anti-American sentiment, they do talk about, you know, the dangers of attacking Iran.
[02:00:32.117 --> 02:00:38.243]  But that's a more larger, sophisticated system of then finally, when the globalists are done with us, sinking America forever.
[02:00:38.403 --> 02:00:38.944]  Do you see that?
[02:00:39.611 --> 02:00:49.555]  Yeah, but I don't hear, I don't hear in America, I don't hear hardly hear any of the mainstream media networks talking about what a disaster this is.
[02:00:49.575 --> 02:00:52.217]  And you don't hear them saying the dollar's turning into toilet paper?
[02:00:52.557 --> 02:00:55.158]  And you don't hear them saying we've already got a world ID card?
[02:00:55.198 --> 02:00:55.698]  Exactly!
[02:00:56.018 --> 02:01:03.301]  They're there to pacify Rush Limbaugh and then the liberals on the other side are there to pacify the people until it's too late.
[02:01:04.742 --> 02:01:05.843]  Disgraceful.
[02:01:05.883 --> 02:01:06.703]  I'm just shocked that
[02:01:07.568 --> 02:01:08.809]  How many Iraqis have died?
[02:01:08.849 --> 02:01:10.991]  How many American soldiers have died?
[02:01:12.252 --> 02:01:17.356]  We're not talking about what the consequences... But how many trillions have the globalists made?
[02:01:18.121 --> 02:01:19.762]  See, that's their view.
[02:01:20.182 --> 02:01:21.602]  They're just dumb animals.
[02:01:22.042 --> 02:01:22.862]  Let them die.
[02:01:22.942 --> 02:01:24.423]  That's what Kissinger said about the troops.
[02:01:24.843 --> 02:01:28.264]  And then he runs the White House, basically, and it's all how they love the troops.
[02:01:28.344 --> 02:01:33.966]  It's a sick joke for the saps that stick those support the troops stickers all over their car.
[02:01:34.426 --> 02:01:38.907]  It's like giving somebody a morphine shot before you drop them in a meat grinder.
[02:01:39.327 --> 02:01:41.269]  They just tell them, oh, we love you troops.
[02:01:41.490 --> 02:01:43.011]  Here's a deadly experimental shot.
[02:01:43.232 --> 02:01:45.594]  Here's some D.E.U., oh, but we love ya.
[02:01:45.995 --> 02:01:48.698]  We're not gonna let you vote in the election, but we love ya.
[02:01:48.938 --> 02:01:52.162]  We're gonna keep you over the three, four, five tours, but we love ya.
[02:01:52.182 --> 02:01:53.864]  Oh, we love ya.
[02:01:54.684 --> 02:01:57.446]  I mean, it's just like, settle down, let me put the handcuffs on you.
[02:01:57.786 --> 02:02:06.932]  That's what Ted Bundy would do, he'd go, honey, it's alright, I'm not gonna hurt you, just come on into the shack, he'd have the gun on her, come on in here, let me just tie you down, everything's gonna be alright.
[02:02:07.432 --> 02:02:14.617]  And as soon as he got him tied down, as we now know this from him testifying and some people that escaped, he'd go, now I'm gonna torture you to death!
[02:02:15.937 --> 02:02:18.558]  You see, and that's how they're just putting the handcuffs on.
[02:02:18.598 --> 02:02:21.398]  There you go, America.
[02:02:22.038 --> 02:02:23.539]  Oh, we're the patriots.
[02:02:23.879 --> 02:02:25.079]  We're Fox News.
[02:02:25.479 --> 02:02:28.259]  Everything's gonna be alright real soon.
[02:02:28.619 --> 02:02:30.660]  Just give us a little more time.
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:33.380]  We got something real special for you.
[02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:36.121]  Don't listen to those people who aren't patriotic.
[02:02:36.421 --> 02:02:37.721]  They need to be arrested.
[02:02:38.101 --> 02:02:40.142]  And we're gonna arrest them, alright?
[02:02:40.162 --> 02:02:40.922]  Okay?
[02:02:48.613 --> 02:02:54.080]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:03:02.090]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.774 --> 02:03:09.816]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.236 --> 02:03:21.658]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.959 --> 02:03:25.439]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.919 --> 02:03:27.840]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.180 --> 02:03:32.041]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:51.309 --> 02:03:55.451]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:55.871 --> 02:03:56.712]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.032 --> 02:04:01.594]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.074 --> 02:04:04.196]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:04.696 --> 02:04:19.389]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:04:48.953 --> 02:04:51.595]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:04:52.350 --> 02:05:08.506]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[02:05:09.467 --> 02:05:14.652]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.

[02:05:53.154 --> 02:05:54.275]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.915 --> 02:05:55.736]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.496 --> 02:05:57.397]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.037 --> 02:06:01.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:06.303]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.063 --> 02:06:14.010]  This hour is brought to you by InnerFood, an incredible whole food derived directly from plants.
[02:06:14.710 --> 02:06:20.295]  It has minerals, seaweed, hundreds of different extracts, and it is great stuff.
[02:06:20.816 --> 02:06:24.019]  I put it in with orange juice or apple juice.
[02:06:24.099 --> 02:06:31.586]  The FDA and Big Pharma are conspiring to deprive you of the nutrition, energy, and good health that you're entitled to, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:32.173 --> 02:06:32.874]  Thank you, sir.
[02:06:45.347 --> 02:06:45.587]  I think so.
[02:07:04.178 --> 02:07:15.823]  7 6 2 9 2 3 8 or visit them on the web at innerfood.com that's E N E R food.com or 1 8 6 6 7 6 2 9 2 3 8 by the way we've used these green foods before
[02:07:21.221 --> 02:07:25.163]  And a lot of them taste horrible, or give you a headache, or too strong, or something.
[02:07:25.563 --> 02:07:28.005]  Or they use, you know, chemical varieties of the vitamins.
[02:07:28.545 --> 02:07:29.165]  Not this stuff.
[02:07:29.205 --> 02:07:33.167]  My wife is quite a commissure of things, health-wise.
[02:07:33.227 --> 02:07:34.368]  This is really great stuff.
[02:07:34.768 --> 02:07:35.388]  She likes it.
[02:07:35.749 --> 02:07:36.649]  And I like it, too.
[02:07:37.129 --> 02:07:38.410]  Innerfood.com.
[02:07:38.850 --> 02:07:40.331]  And they support the show on their Patreon.
[02:07:40.351 --> 02:07:40.551]  It's 866-762-9238.
[02:07:40.571 --> 02:07:41.191]  So, patronize them.
[02:07:41.231 --> 02:07:41.732]  Support them.
[02:07:41.752 --> 02:07:42.732]  They're great folks.
[02:07:52.029 --> 02:07:56.912]  And I'm certainly a patron of them because, not just because they support the show, they have a great product.
[02:07:56.952 --> 02:08:03.316]  And I didn't know that the nutritionist that runs it is from Austin, friends with George Humphreys, friends with so many other people that I know.
[02:08:03.737 --> 02:08:08.039]  And everybody kept talking about it for two years, and now I've tried it and I said, I better get them as a sponsor.
[02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:10.521]  And they are a sponsor, InnerFood.com.
[02:08:10.861 --> 02:08:16.145]  Okay, let's go back to the calls here.
[02:08:16.205 --> 02:08:17.926]  Charles in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:08:17.966 --> 02:08:18.586]  Thanks for holding.
[02:08:18.606 --> 02:08:18.967]  Go ahead.
[02:08:19.927 --> 02:08:20.728]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:08:21.678 --> 02:08:24.441]  I have a take on something you were commenting on yesterday.
[02:08:24.461 --> 02:08:34.209]  I wanted to slightly comment on the Austin Air Force, the mandatory tailpipe emissions and toll roads, and carbon trading.
[02:08:34.570 --> 02:08:35.070]  Well, yes.
[02:08:35.931 --> 02:08:37.832]  Let me just fill folks in so they know what we're talking about.
[02:08:38.193 --> 02:08:43.918]  There was a big announcement that they want to have an international agreement without governments, just the corporations that are the government now.
[02:08:45.182 --> 02:08:55.370]  agree to charge you when you fly for a carbon footprint and they basically just keep the money and the Queen of England when she flies now pays a voluntary tax.
[02:08:55.410 --> 02:09:01.495]  That's how the income tax started was voluntary for thirty years before they made it quote mandatory which it really still isn't.
[02:09:01.916 --> 02:09:03.016]  They just create a custom.
[02:09:03.036 --> 02:09:12.464]  It's like the feds squat on you or the companies squat on you until it becomes basically common law by practice or by ritual
[02:09:13.284 --> 02:09:24.653]  And they're just doing it, and, oh, we're going to have a carbon tax, claiming carbon dioxide is a toxic waste, and then that leads into one-child policies and taxing humans for even breathing.
[02:09:25.114 --> 02:09:26.555]  And we've always said that was their plan.
[02:09:26.635 --> 02:09:27.596]  Now that's official.
[02:09:27.956 --> 02:09:29.938]  Headline, taxing you for breathing.
[02:09:30.978 --> 02:09:31.799]  They're actually doing it.
[02:09:31.819 --> 02:09:32.159]  Go ahead.
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:33.801]  Right.
[02:09:34.521 --> 02:09:39.365]  You mentioned yesterday, you're like everybody, you don't want to breathe automobile exhaust
[02:09:41.153 --> 02:09:43.735]  You mentioned you didn't mind the catalytic converter on your vehicle.
[02:09:44.555 --> 02:09:56.564]  And just to bring it together, the fuel injection and computer in the modern automobile are all there supposedly because of automobile emissions to reduce them.
[02:09:57.304 --> 02:10:06.851]  And the thing is, before, what brought me into this is I decided to look into this high mileage carburetor to see if it really existed.
[02:10:07.412 --> 02:10:09.033]  And I was stunned with what I found out.
[02:10:09.253 --> 02:10:21.962]  Everybody that looks into this, there's two names that come up constantly, but one of them is a Thomas Ogle from Texas who in 1979 went a hundred miles, more than a hundred miles on one gallon of gas and a 4,000 pound plus Ford LTD.
[02:10:22.682 --> 02:10:28.526]  Well, the thing is, I looked into it from that point of view and what I found just amazed me.
[02:10:28.986 --> 02:10:34.490]  The first guy who's credited with making an automobile in the United States, a gasoline powered automobile,
[02:10:34.892 --> 02:10:35.132]  I think so.
[02:10:56.545 --> 02:11:08.388]  Look, back in the late 60's General Motors put out a nationwide flyer bragging that they developed 95 mile a gallon fuel injection carburetor systems.
[02:11:08.728 --> 02:11:18.070]  So there's no doubt that they will not allow us to have better fuel efficiency because the oil companies basically are merged with the big central banks and it's their business.
[02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:19.990]  And so you're absolutely right.
[02:11:21.244 --> 02:11:42.977]  What this global carbon tax does is it takes all the environmental energies that should be for restricting VT fertilizer, corn that has pesticides in it killing the bees, or stopping chimera cross-species cloning that is deadly dangerous and also an abomination, or all these serious issues, or toxic waste dumping and
[02:11:44.077 --> 02:11:59.682]  Or some of these coal-fired plants, like the government blocks all the clean-burning coal mines in Utah and other areas around the country for 500 plus years, then they dig out the dirty lignite, they dump it in these coal-fired plants, then I've got to breathe mercury, my children do.
[02:12:00.082 --> 02:12:01.082]  It's insane!
[02:12:01.562 --> 02:12:08.164]  Look, everything they use environmentalism to set up feudalism to control their competition, it has nothing.
[02:12:08.504 --> 02:12:16.751]  Another interesting thing about this though, I'm not a legendary related, but the number of people who are affiliated with oil companies that hold these patents, among them
[02:12:35.798 --> 02:12:45.601]  is William Henry Chaney who built one of these 100 mile per gallon carburetor devices in 1933 and patented it.
[02:12:47.161 --> 02:13:02.146]  I know so there is no doubt and I appreciate your call that there are incredible carburetors and then later fuel injectors that I mean the Japanese official companies like Toyota and others
[02:13:02.862 --> 02:13:09.825]  They have put out 75, 80, 90 mile an hour fuel injection and carburetor systems 20, 30 years ago.
[02:13:10.525 --> 02:13:12.186]  But it just is not adopted.
[02:13:13.846 --> 02:13:19.228]  Instead they give you, you know, these quack electrical cars, systems that nobody wants to adopt.
[02:13:19.268 --> 02:13:20.489]  It's all sophisticated.
[02:13:21.429 --> 02:13:23.210]  It's extremely sophisticated.
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:33.088]  uh... there with their whole propaganda arm in red palace but with the bbc the documents that eleven years ago natural shell and queen matrix uh... cooked up
[02:13:33.763 --> 02:13:36.645]  Dutch Rochelle merged with Anglo-American Oil about 60 years ago.
[02:13:37.065 --> 02:13:38.586]  So it's a British slash Dutch company.
[02:13:39.407 --> 02:13:43.470]  The second biggest oil company in the world, next to Exxon Mobil, was the biggest until they merged.
[02:13:44.090 --> 02:13:46.252]  And they fund the funny environmental groups.
[02:13:46.352 --> 02:13:47.032]  They bankroll them.
[02:13:47.393 --> 02:13:48.694]  They bankroll almost every group.
[02:13:49.054 --> 02:13:50.895]  Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club.
[02:13:50.915 --> 02:13:53.317]  Now they're bankrolling the global carbon tax.
[02:13:53.337 --> 02:13:56.319]  They're bankrolling the university studies, claiming there's no more oil.
[02:13:56.599 --> 02:13:58.080]  Well, why do you think they'll do that?
[02:13:58.581 --> 02:14:02.283]  Artificial scarcity, just like De Beers and the Oppenheimers with the diamonds.
[02:14:02.643 --> 02:14:03.344]  I mean, we have
[02:14:04.295 --> 02:14:06.596]  Everybody, neocons must have talking points.
[02:14:08.137 --> 02:14:19.563]  Because they're all over talk radio, every day, every time I tune in, they're saying, well you know the oil companies only make 18 cents a gallon, and it's some news article put out by the oil companies.
[02:14:20.904 --> 02:14:27.107]  And yeah, they can go average it together with small oil companies that don't make a big profit, and average that in with Exxon Mobil, that's one way they do it.
[02:14:27.427 --> 02:14:29.188]  Also those companies hide most of their wealth.
[02:14:29.688 --> 02:14:30.889]  But the point is, is what?
[02:14:31.861 --> 02:14:36.584]  Exxon Mobil made $380-something billion in 2006.
[02:14:36.924 --> 02:14:38.405]  That's what they said they made.
[02:14:38.425 --> 02:14:39.366]  I'm going from memory on that.
[02:14:39.406 --> 02:14:39.866]  Pull it up.
[02:14:40.526 --> 02:14:43.948]  And that's just one of the Big Ten oil companies.
[02:14:43.968 --> 02:14:47.030]  $300-something billion profit.
[02:14:49.151 --> 02:14:50.952]  And you go, well, what are you, a commie?
[02:14:50.992 --> 02:14:52.033]  You're not for free market?
[02:14:52.333 --> 02:14:53.494]  It's not free market!
[02:14:53.834 --> 02:14:58.477]  We have the oil company documents from 95 and 96 where they had summits in Houston
[02:14:59.648 --> 02:15:00.308]  And New York.
[02:15:00.668 --> 02:15:02.749]  And then the memos and the emails went back and forth.
[02:15:03.089 --> 02:15:03.829]  Hundreds of pages.
[02:15:03.989 --> 02:15:13.110]  Associated Press got them in 2000 during a lawsuit where they say, we're going to buy up every one of these 200 plus refineries that are in North America, Canada, the U.S.
[02:15:13.150 --> 02:15:17.611]  and Mexico and shut off the refining capacity because there's too much oil!
[02:15:18.191 --> 02:15:22.172]  It's being discovered everywhere and our monopoly is being challenged.
[02:15:22.292 --> 02:15:23.452]  They have an oligopoly.
[02:15:23.892 --> 02:15:24.552]  Period.
[02:15:25.092 --> 02:15:26.013]  End of discussion.
[02:15:26.373 --> 02:15:27.113]  End of debate.
[02:15:27.593 --> 02:15:28.193]  On its face.
[02:15:29.858 --> 02:15:31.719]  John in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:15:33.261 --> 02:15:53.535]  I think it's, you know, honest conservatives, real conservatives, as opposed to the official, unofficial neocon fascists, along with real leftists, really, I think might be in my position, where I would prefer a socialist candidate like WSWS.org or WorkersOrg, but I'm rooting for
[02:15:54.119 --> 02:15:58.903]  Ron Paul, even though I disagree with economic policies that he espouses.
[02:15:58.983 --> 02:16:05.048]  I think he's bearding these phony prostitutes in their own den.
[02:16:05.228 --> 02:16:17.117]  In the near term, he's really a hope to break up this move towards perpetual war and empire and these police state measures that are really over our shoulder in the near term.
[02:16:17.157 --> 02:16:19.619]  So I'm really rooting for him along those lines.
[02:16:20.099 --> 02:16:21.080]  And you mentioned earlier
[02:16:21.727 --> 02:16:33.888]  uh... that uh... uh... the uh... bush had said that if the uh... iraqi government wants us to leave this total puppet this corrupt puppet installed by the united states which has a vested interest in keeping us troops there to protect them from the wrath
[02:16:34.321 --> 02:16:36.062]  of their own people for being quiet.
[02:16:36.082 --> 02:16:36.442]  Oh, I know.
[02:16:36.462 --> 02:16:46.807]  I mean, everyone out there, you know, you can go look at the proof if you want, but everybody knows that that's a puppet government over there, and so the joke of, if they ask us to leave, we'll go.
[02:16:47.687 --> 02:16:48.487]  You know something, though?
[02:16:48.607 --> 02:16:52.049]  They have done that a couple of weeks ago, and the media has blacked this out.
[02:16:53.210 --> 02:17:00.753]  Over half of that puppet parliament... That's right, the puppet parliament has even revolted, but still they just say, well, if the president wants it, we'll stay.
[02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:06.303]  Well, they've even called for a timeline, a definite timeline for U.S.
[02:17:06.323 --> 02:17:17.789]  troops to get out of Kaplan troops in between that time and the banning of the United Nations giving any kind of authorization for a continuation of the occupation.
[02:17:17.829 --> 02:17:18.629]  So this has happened.
[02:17:18.649 --> 02:17:25.553]  You've got the American people, according to the exit polls, two-thirds of them wanted out at the last election.
[02:17:26.852 --> 02:17:28.794]  Iraqi people, overwhelmingly.
[02:17:29.174 --> 02:17:39.603]  The soldiers over there, as you mentioned, even though they're under military discipline, is probably 99%, but 72% were willing to say they wanted... Hang on, finish your point on the other side, John.
[02:17:39.623 --> 02:17:41.264]  Finish your point, we'll be right back.
[02:17:41.284 --> 02:17:42.325]  I've got a lot of news coming up, too.
[02:17:45.629 --> 02:17:49.893]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:17:50.153 --> 02:17:55.057]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:17:55.257 --> 02:17:56.598]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:17:56.758 --> 02:18:00.101]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Cal Bend Pure Soaps?
[02:18:00.361 --> 02:18:05.525]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[02:18:05.785 --> 02:18:11.550]  Marty Schachter founded Cal Bend Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[02:18:11.870 --> 02:18:14.311]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[02:18:14.391 --> 02:18:16.711]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[02:18:16.911 --> 02:18:19.052]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[02:18:19.332 --> 02:18:20.332]  No harsh chemicals.
[02:18:20.532 --> 02:18:21.473]  No animal testing.
[02:18:21.733 --> 02:18:23.053]  I use them and love them.
[02:18:23.073 --> 02:18:24.674]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:18:24.954 --> 02:18:26.054]  And I say it big time.
[02:18:26.354 --> 02:18:27.854]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:18:27.934 --> 02:18:28.294]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[02:18:28.355 --> 02:18:30.795]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[02:18:37.817 --> 02:18:44.340]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:18:46.121 --> 02:18:49.983]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[02:18:50.003 --> 02:18:51.264]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:18:51.424 --> 02:18:54.986]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:18:55.286 --> 02:18:57.807]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[02:18:58.207 --> 02:18:59.948]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:19:00.288 --> 02:19:02.430]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:19:03.630 --> 02:19:14.075]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:19:15.756 --> 02:19:18.057]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:19:18.117 --> 02:19:21.199]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[02:19:21.419 --> 02:19:23.880]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.

[02:19:26.622 --> 02:19:26.922]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:35.066 --> 02:19:51.618]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:19:51.938 --> 02:19:56.021]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:19:56.321 --> 02:19:56.882]  We listened.
[02:19:57.182 --> 02:20:02.165]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:20:02.426 --> 02:20:02.906]  We listened.
[02:20:03.286 --> 02:20:06.308]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:20:06.748 --> 02:20:07.289]  We listened.
[02:20:07.749 --> 02:20:11.812]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:20:12.192 --> 02:20:12.672]  We listened.
[02:20:13.013 --> 02:20:18.256]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:20:18.676 --> 02:20:20.037]  Again, we listened.
[02:20:20.398 --> 02:20:22.619]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity
[02:20:22.759 --> 02:20:25.140]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.

[02:20:26.061 --> 02:20:26.361]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:20:26.381 --> 02:20:28.342]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:20:28.362 --> 02:20:29.243]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:20:50.377 --> 02:20:52.698]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[02:20:52.978 --> 02:21:01.223]  That's why you need SFR's Protect-A Synthetic Oil Treatments, Protect-A Engine Treatment, Protect-A Transmission Treatment, and Protect-A Complete Fuel System Treatment.

[02:21:16.687 --> 02:21:18.928]  At Protekta, we do not compromise quality.

[02:21:56.376 --> 02:21:58.518]  Got some big news coming up in the next segment.
[02:21:59.019 --> 02:22:01.101]  John in Ohio, finish up your point.
[02:22:01.141 --> 02:22:03.344]  Yes, we know the people don't want to be there.
[02:22:03.404 --> 02:22:03.964]  It's a lie.
[02:22:04.024 --> 02:22:04.565]  It's a fraud.
[02:22:04.625 --> 02:22:11.032]  It's meant to demonize America for the big banks as they prepare to make the European Union the preeminent
[02:22:12.122 --> 02:22:16.265]  Of course, in the world, they're completely destroying our economy, the multinationals.
[02:22:16.705 --> 02:22:19.987]  What's the scariest thing is they are literally evacuating the U.S.
[02:22:20.448 --> 02:22:23.530]  People thought that there were corporate downsizing and offshoring before.
[02:22:23.550 --> 02:22:34.197]  It is now in free fall, the dollar is plunging, and the average yuppie's watching Fox News and feeling good and feeling like everything's great, but the honeymoon is just about over, John.
[02:22:35.279 --> 02:22:45.746]  Yeah, and I think these characters are going to become even more desperate and try to fail forward as the people want out immediate or rapid withdrawal.
[02:22:45.786 --> 02:22:49.248]  The Iraqi people overwhelmingly, according to the polls, want out.
[02:22:49.368 --> 02:22:53.150]  Even the puppet government now, over half of them, say they want us out.
[02:22:53.991 --> 02:22:59.394]  Yet these guys are determined to drag us into a bigger catastrophe, apparently in Iran.
[02:23:00.235 --> 02:23:01.896]  And if you look at the situation,
[02:23:02.706 --> 02:23:08.854]  It's incredible the double standard and hypocrisy in which the United Nations, which I believe is really a pawn of the U.S.
[02:23:08.894 --> 02:23:11.397]  military-industrial complex, has completely collapsed.
[02:23:11.417 --> 02:23:12.819]  Well, go to another level, though.
[02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:15.763]  I mean, it's the private corporations that own America.
[02:23:16.103 --> 02:23:17.866]  America is a pawn, so is the U.N.
[02:23:18.866 --> 02:23:34.067]  Yeah, but I think the immediate task is to prevent dragging us into a bigger catastrophe in Iran, because if you look at the situation, this government is sending terrorists and opposition groups and saboteurs... Now let's be clear!
[02:23:34.107 --> 02:23:34.707]  Let's be clear!
[02:23:35.748 --> 02:23:49.294]  Let's be clear, and they claim that Al-Qaeda is real, and Al-Qaeda is going to get us, and then our criminal government is using Wahhabis to admittedly carry out mass shootings and bombings all over the western area of Iran.
[02:23:49.594 --> 02:23:58.258]  So the literal sect that Al-Qaeda comes from and the real Al-Qaeda affiliated groups is, as usual, what our government is controlling to attack the Iranians.
[02:23:58.578 --> 02:24:00.539]  Yes, and these are acts of war.
[02:24:00.559 --> 02:24:02.100]  They're not doing that to us.
[02:24:02.140 --> 02:24:04.561]  We've got huge nuclear carrier groups
[02:24:05.023 --> 02:24:07.685]  Are threatening them, probing all along their coast.
[02:24:07.725 --> 02:24:15.813]  And now Bush has authorized, quote, more covert action, openly announcing covert action inside Iran, and Iran is just sitting there and tagging it.
[02:24:16.053 --> 02:24:20.116]  It's like somebody, a big bully, slapping him in the face, trying to get him to fight back.
[02:24:20.417 --> 02:24:21.558]  And then the press is shocked.
[02:24:21.858 --> 02:24:25.701]  Oh my God, Iran said if we nuke them with mini-nukes, they might fight back.
[02:24:25.961 --> 02:24:29.044]  How radical if we nuke them, they might fire back!
[02:24:29.144 --> 02:24:31.927]  John, I've never heard of such barbarousness!
[02:24:32.387 --> 02:24:34.208]  Yeah, I mean, it's the hypocrisy.
[02:24:34.268 --> 02:24:40.830]  We've got them sandwiched between two big occupying, bombing US militaries in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:24:40.850 --> 02:24:56.116]  It would be like they were a thousand times more powerful, attacked Canada and Mexico, we're bombing the hell out of them, and we're telling us that if we didn't get rid of our 10,000 nuclear weapons, they have none, they're going to attack us and nuke us.
[02:24:56.236 --> 02:24:59.237]  I mean, the hypocrisy and the double standard of it
[02:24:59.908 --> 02:25:02.729]  The 10,000 nuclear weapons we got pointed at them.
[02:25:02.769 --> 02:25:04.810]  The 500 Israel's got pointed at them.
[02:25:05.250 --> 02:25:08.512]  We help India get more nuclear weapons.
[02:25:08.572 --> 02:25:10.232]  Pakistan get more nuclear weapons.
[02:25:10.252 --> 02:25:14.334]  Pakistan is a dictatorship running around with long-range nukes bombing at the mouth.
[02:25:14.614 --> 02:25:15.595]  Iran has nothing.
[02:25:15.655 --> 02:25:16.515]  It's a total scam.
[02:25:18.115 --> 02:25:26.083]  But the point is, the double standard that is being peddled by the media and fools some people, it's amazing that most people want to get out of that area still.
[02:25:26.103 --> 02:25:35.353]  Listen, every week they put generals on TV and they go, new Al-Qaeda tape, and it's totally fake, and the general, we're doing quite well, things are going well in Iraq.
[02:25:35.613 --> 02:25:38.156]  I mean, they're just stringing us along, laughing at us.
[02:25:38.636 --> 02:25:41.037]  They're laughing at us and the Democrats are complicit.
[02:25:41.077 --> 02:25:51.242]  I remember Nancy Pelosi about two weeks ago and asked, what are you going to do with the rising disaffection of your Democratic base who wants out of that war over there?
[02:25:51.282 --> 02:25:53.203]  She said, I know how to handle them.
[02:25:53.223 --> 02:25:55.104]  I can deal with them.
[02:25:55.825 --> 02:25:57.125]  I can keep them in line.
[02:25:57.405 --> 02:26:04.829]  This is the attitude that we're children and that they can just string us along endlessly without doing anything but cutting off the funds
[02:26:05.273 --> 02:26:09.657]  They have billions of dollars extra to withdraw those troops safely and evacuate them safely.
[02:26:09.677 --> 02:26:12.219]  Well, my only concern is, I mean, how long can this go on?
[02:26:12.259 --> 02:26:14.121]  Because the elite's humorous.
[02:26:14.141 --> 02:26:18.365]  I mean, if I was the elite and I was evil and I had all this power, I would try to play soft power.
[02:26:18.825 --> 02:26:20.147]  I would try to move slowly.
[02:26:20.167 --> 02:26:25.191]  I mean, they are just jeopardizing everything in a wild-eyed, self-destructive way.
[02:26:25.992 --> 02:26:31.057]  Well, that's true, but I think it's really the crisis of the monopoly worldwide
[02:26:31.823 --> 02:26:37.785]  Capitalist system that they're sitting atop, and we've got to look at that as a fundamental problem.
[02:26:37.825 --> 02:26:38.565]  That's why I'm on the left.
[02:26:38.585 --> 02:26:40.446]  You're saying they've got to keep jacking up the bubble?
[02:26:41.386 --> 02:26:53.389]  I think so, and I think we've got to do something to take that power away from them, and that the source of their power is the ownership and control of all the means of wealth, the factories, mines, the media, and the rest of it.
[02:26:53.849 --> 02:26:58.791]  At some point, I think we're going to have to go beyond just simply demanding our Bill of Rights, which is a good thing,
[02:26:59.326 --> 02:27:03.808]  And take that power away from them and have our representatives elected to all of these industries.
[02:27:03.828 --> 02:27:04.848]  But this is how it'll work.
[02:27:04.908 --> 02:27:15.132]  The bankers will get control of that, and then instead it'll be my house that's taken at gunpoint by some local hippies with a machine gun and the cops going, man, it's the new my way!
[02:27:15.152 --> 02:27:16.713]  And we're taking your children!
[02:27:19.794 --> 02:27:22.696]  Any central system will always be abused.
[02:27:22.996 --> 02:27:27.939]  The only way you stop the criminal consolidation of power is having absolute limits on it.
[02:27:28.460 --> 02:27:32.463]  Hence the true paleo-conservative, libertarian economic view.
[02:27:32.723 --> 02:27:33.443]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:33.483 --> 02:27:34.984]  Thanks, John.
[02:27:35.965 --> 02:27:36.906]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.366 --> 02:27:38.987]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.888 --> 02:27:42.590]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.092 --> 02:27:48.573]  Do you know that you can go solar for under 1200 bucks now?
[02:27:48.593 --> 02:27:50.234]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[02:27:50.434 --> 02:27:54.597]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[02:27:55.197 --> 02:28:00.080]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[02:28:00.580 --> 02:28:07.024]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[02:28:07.765 --> 02:28:10.447]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[02:28:10.627 --> 02:28:20.593]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[02:28:20.853 --> 02:28:24.575]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[02:28:24.615 --> 02:28:31.119]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[02:28:31.299 --> 02:28:32.339]  Are you ready to go solar?
[02:28:32.539 --> 02:28:33.480]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[02:28:37.382 --> 02:28:41.446]  Or order them on the website at a 10% discount on KenSolar.com.
[02:28:41.686 --> 02:28:43.969]  That's KenSolar.com.
[02:28:44.932 --> 02:28:49.515]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:28:49.915 --> 02:28:52.837]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:28:53.178 --> 02:28:55.739]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:28:56.100 --> 02:29:00.923]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:29:01.303 --> 02:29:06.667]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:29:06.967 --> 02:29:09.929]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[02:29:10.129 --> 02:29:10.689]  We're good to go.
[02:29:33.516 --> 02:29:38.984]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:29:39.004 --> 02:29:39.444]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:29:45.754 --> 02:29:49.596]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[02:29:49.876 --> 02:29:53.739]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[02:29:54.099 --> 02:29:59.122]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[02:29:59.402 --> 02:30:10.588]  Electrolyzed plus water will alkalize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[02:30:10.908 --> 02:30:15.249]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and environmentally safe for humans and animals.
[02:30:15.509 --> 02:30:24.831]  Alkaline water is available as a concentrate to be mixed with good, filtered, purified RO water, but not tap water, micro-structured alkaline antioxidant water for consumption.
[02:30:24.991 --> 02:30:34.613]  Call for your Electrolyzed Plus Alkalinizing Nourical Rejuvenating Water Concentrate or other remarkable RPA Biotech products like Ultimate Fuel Sport Performance Drink at 888-212-8871
[02:30:37.414 --> 02:30:41.195]  That's 888-212-8871 or go to Nutramedical.com.
[02:30:41.355 --> 02:30:44.236]  That's N-U-T-R-I with an I, Medical.com.
[02:30:55.139 --> 02:31:03.582]  Tell the folks to burn, make the waves that fly.
[02:31:08.235 --> 02:31:08.836]  You're right.
[02:31:20.860 --> 02:31:27.464]  It ain't me, it ain't me no, I ain't no sinner that time.
[02:31:27.544 --> 02:31:34.168]  It ain't me no, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one.
[02:31:46.033 --> 02:31:49.095]  Lord, don't they have themselves?
[02:31:49.135 --> 02:31:51.697]  Don't they have themselves?
[02:31:52.397 --> 02:31:55.779]  The taxman gives them the key to the land.
[02:31:56.380 --> 02:32:00.102]  There wasn't quite enough left for school and health.
[02:32:00.362 --> 02:32:02.103]  Yeah, just me.
[02:32:02.784 --> 02:32:03.964]  It ain't me, no.
[02:32:04.365 --> 02:32:05.305]  It ain't me, no.
[02:32:05.405 --> 02:32:08.787]  I ain't no millionaire son.
[02:32:13.350 --> 02:32:14.231]  It ain't me, no.
[02:32:14.372 --> 02:32:15.753]  It ain't me, no.
[02:32:15.953 --> 02:32:19.557]  I ain't the fortunate one.
[02:32:19.877 --> 02:32:22.780]  The folks I love, inherit my regular life.
[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:27.185]  I don't need to send you off to war.
[02:32:33.971 --> 02:32:38.593]  And when you actin', how much did you get?
[02:32:39.034 --> 02:32:47.598]  They tell you more and more, more, more, more, more, more.
[02:32:52.234 --> 02:32:56.618]  Alright, welcome back.
[02:32:56.678 --> 02:33:04.764]  Before I get into some news and then more calls from Alex, Steve, Wes, Patrick and others that'll probably be up for calls.
[02:33:04.884 --> 02:33:05.785]  Oh, here's the best part!
[02:33:17.143 --> 02:33:19.244]  Welcome back!
[02:33:44.116 --> 02:33:48.497]  I hope that all of you will take action and visit Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:48.537 --> 02:34:04.863]  I mean, the articles on martial law, Bush declaring himself a dictator, all these quotes, Paul went through literally dozens of articles and audio clips to find these from the show, the things he's said on a host of issues from economics to martial law to the war to terrorism.
[02:34:06.183 --> 02:34:07.524]  That's Ron Paul on the record.
[02:34:07.544 --> 02:34:09.524]  There's a big fight with Digg.
[02:34:09.544 --> 02:34:11.425]  They're real mad that our Digg
[02:34:12.745 --> 02:34:20.730]  Listeners have gotten higher experience rates than they have, that you like get precedence the longer you've been a DIG member, and that we're now able to push stories on the main page.
[02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:22.591]  So they've declared war openly.
[02:34:22.651 --> 02:34:25.993]  It's on DIG to try to block out any stories you submit.
[02:34:26.473 --> 02:34:34.318]  I say we counter them right back and DIG this Ron Paul on the record to the top of DIG where literally millions a day will be able to read it.
[02:34:34.598 --> 02:34:36.499]  This is a key chink in the enemy's armor.
[02:34:36.820 --> 02:34:40.722]  This is something much better than the Drudge Report that we can take over for the truth.
[02:34:41.824 --> 02:34:45.926]  Now, Digg, the official company, has banned us before and then unbanned us because of pressure.
[02:34:46.186 --> 02:34:52.228]  They like to claim it's a digital democracy, but then if you actually win, they try to cheat like they're doing Ron Paul and do that.
[02:34:52.488 --> 02:34:55.149]  They now say they're going to ban anything that says Ron Paul in it.
[02:34:55.589 --> 02:34:56.729]  Well, let's just see them try.
[02:34:58.150 --> 02:35:00.791]  The problem is there's so many people doing this, it's hard for them to catch it all.
[02:35:01.311 --> 02:35:02.071]  So that's up there.
[02:35:02.512 --> 02:35:06.253]  And why don't you write up your own articles about martial law, road to tyranny,
[02:35:07.845 --> 02:35:15.168]  Terror Storm, and then post with a video link, a little blurb to there, under your own name through Digg, and try to get it dug up.
[02:35:15.188 --> 02:35:22.352]  I mean, let's hit them from all different angles, so tens of millions can learn the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:24.253 --> 02:35:35.498]  I don't even, I mean, we report this until it loses its effect, but the Loose Change crew was able to get screenshots and documentation that they had, because you can look at the top 100, how many views they've gotten from number one down to number 100,
[02:35:36.733 --> 02:35:42.664]  You can look in the Google videos and see, well, should Order of Death have been taken out of the top 100 when it was at number 1?
[02:35:44.247 --> 02:35:47.353]  And the answer is no, it should have still been at like number 55.
[02:35:49.214 --> 02:35:54.939]  Went to number 1, went to number 11, then they just took it completely off, though it should have still been in the top 100.
[02:35:55.839 --> 02:35:57.701]  Loose Change should have been in the top 10.
[02:35:58.381 --> 02:36:01.023]  They banned them and kicked them back out of the top 100.
[02:36:01.343 --> 02:36:01.704]  Why?
[02:36:02.044 --> 02:36:07.568]  Because tens of millions a day go to the Google Top 100 to pick some of the things they want to watch.
[02:36:07.968 --> 02:36:11.871]  It's like being on national television in the cyberspace world.
[02:36:12.452 --> 02:36:14.733]  Do you think they want us on national television?
[02:36:15.194 --> 02:36:18.096]  There's those type of viewers, that type of numbers.
[02:36:18.996 --> 02:36:22.698]  Okay, bare minimum, you know, quarter million, half million if you're up there for a day.
[02:36:22.718 --> 02:36:25.120]  In a week, it can be ten, fifteen million.
[02:36:25.140 --> 02:36:26.361]  Sometimes it's two or three million.
[02:36:26.661 --> 02:36:28.302]  You'll get one day of being on the main page.
[02:36:28.922 --> 02:36:30.463]  They're cheating us, and they admit they are.
[02:36:30.523 --> 02:36:31.904]  I mean, Google has said this.
[02:36:32.104 --> 02:36:34.006]  Then you'll say, well, why do you have Google Ads on your website?
[02:36:34.286 --> 02:36:41.370]  That's another division of it, and if I can use the enemy's, you know, capital to fight them, I mean, that'd be like in a war.
[02:36:41.811 --> 02:36:46.153]  You know, if I could get a hold of an enemy weapons cache, would I use those?
[02:36:46.274 --> 02:36:46.854]  Absolutely.
[02:36:47.836 --> 02:36:49.597]  I mean, that's how these big corporations work.
[02:36:49.637 --> 02:36:53.821]  It's only a certain nest of the corporation, you know, that are censoring and doing this.
[02:36:54.061 --> 02:36:55.842]  It's certainly not the Google Ads division.
[02:36:56.143 --> 02:36:59.205]  So, for me, there's really no qualms about it.
[02:36:59.565 --> 02:37:06.351]  And I suggest you click on those Google Ads, because we get vitally needed capital to expand our operations, and it's the New World Order when you do it.
[02:37:07.912 --> 02:37:10.153]  That's how I'm going to be able to finance expanding and doing more.
[02:37:11.423 --> 02:37:12.544]  I'm already digressing here.
[02:37:13.185 --> 02:37:20.811]  If you want to support us in a way they can't censor us, in a way they can't stop us, buy TerrorStorm at InfoWars.com before the first edition is sold out.
[02:37:20.851 --> 02:37:21.772]  I'm signing each copy.
[02:37:22.193 --> 02:37:23.494]  Until they're gone, they're almost gone.
[02:37:23.794 --> 02:37:24.254]  InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:24.274 --> 02:37:27.037]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:37:36.565 --> 02:37:37.746]  People always say I talk too fast.
[02:37:37.826 --> 02:37:49.218]  It's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704 or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:50.919 --> 02:37:58.107]  And I want to thank all of you that have supported us by buying the books and videos and getting Prison Planet.tv memberships with the thousands of pieces of media up there.
[02:37:58.467 --> 02:37:59.348]  Fifteen cents a day.
[02:37:59.368 --> 02:38:00.389]  I mean, who couldn't afford that?
[02:38:02.361 --> 02:38:03.302]  We couldn't do it without you.
[02:38:03.542 --> 02:38:07.806]  And folks that have sent us donations, you know, you're making it all possible.
[02:38:08.286 --> 02:38:09.867]  Because I'm only turning the heat up here.
[02:38:10.128 --> 02:38:15.813]  My wife this morning was like, you're going to have a heart attack if you keep working 20 hours a day.
[02:38:15.833 --> 02:38:16.713]  But no I'm not.
[02:38:16.753 --> 02:38:17.374]  I feel good.
[02:38:19.748 --> 02:38:21.529]  I look kind of like a zombie, but so what?
[02:38:22.850 --> 02:38:28.254]  This is what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen, because we are going to fight them 110%.
[02:38:28.695 --> 02:38:30.997]  It's going to take pressing the pedal to the metal, folks.
[02:38:31.517 --> 02:38:33.859]  It's going to take grinding your gears to get the job done.
[02:38:34.429 --> 02:38:35.670]  I mean, that's what this is all about.
[02:38:35.690 --> 02:38:37.953]  We've got one chance at this.
[02:38:37.973 --> 02:38:39.454]  We're in the thick of the battle right now.
[02:38:39.755 --> 02:38:42.998]  The New World Order, like Aaron Russo said, is coming down right now.
[02:38:43.579 --> 02:38:50.746]  Everything we've talked about, all the preparations, the gears are clicking, the dominoes are falling right now, and the New World Order is moving.
[02:38:51.006 --> 02:38:53.349]  And while we're in this liquid state societally,
[02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:57.194]  We have that much more power, folks, during this period.
[02:38:57.435 --> 02:38:59.298]  They got a lot of power, we got a lot of power.
[02:38:59.558 --> 02:39:01.341]  Their power is centralized and focused.
[02:39:01.701 --> 02:39:04.626]  Ours is dispersed, but overall much greater than theirs.
[02:39:06.949 --> 02:39:11.372]  So, we just got to turn loose of our fear and just get into the fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:11.612 --> 02:39:12.972]  Keep making copies of my films.
[02:39:13.333 --> 02:39:14.333]  Keep taking action.
[02:39:14.393 --> 02:39:14.974]  Never stop.
[02:39:15.294 --> 02:39:24.139]  Tell people about the AM and FM stations you listen to us on, whether it's in Tennessee or in Kansas or Austin or upstate New York or Florida or California.
[02:39:24.759 --> 02:39:27.200]  Tell people, hey, I listen to, you know, KCXL.
[02:39:27.220 --> 02:39:28.341]  I listen to WBCR.
[02:39:28.361 --> 02:39:29.942]  I listen to KLBJ.
[02:39:29.982 --> 02:39:31.142]  I listen to on and on and on.
[02:39:31.463 --> 02:39:32.463]  I listen in Ohio.
[02:39:32.523 --> 02:39:33.544]  I listen in Norfolk, Virginia.
[02:39:33.604 --> 02:39:35.005]  I listen in Niagara.
[02:39:36.724 --> 02:39:38.065]  This is how we're going to have the effect.
[02:39:38.785 --> 02:39:41.146]  There's a free podcast of the show every day that serves out.
[02:39:41.166 --> 02:39:42.007]  Go subscribe to it.
[02:39:42.287 --> 02:39:43.508]  Tell your friends how to subscribe to it.
[02:39:43.528 --> 02:39:43.928]  It's free.
[02:39:44.188 --> 02:39:45.289]  Listen to how you want, when you want.
[02:39:45.489 --> 02:39:47.570]  Tell folks about the streams at Infowars.com.
[02:39:47.790 --> 02:39:48.731]  Just get aggressive!
[02:39:49.571 --> 02:39:51.992]  I know we've had this much effect because you have gotten aggressive.
[02:39:52.032 --> 02:39:56.054]  I want to ask those that have already given and taken action, I want you to do a double.
[02:39:58.356 --> 02:40:01.457]  I see what you're doing on YouTube and Google and everywhere else and I love you.
[02:40:01.838 --> 02:40:02.998]  And we're comrades together.
[02:40:03.679 --> 02:40:04.499]  So God bless you.
[02:40:05.163 --> 02:40:09.366]  I don't care whether you're a Christian, or a Muslim, or black, or white, or old, or young.
[02:40:09.726 --> 02:40:12.048]  We're all in this fight against the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:12.628 --> 02:40:15.750]  And we're together, brothers in arms, sisters in arms, in this fight.
[02:40:16.751 --> 02:40:17.552]  So please get the videos.
[02:40:17.852 --> 02:40:24.857]  And before I go back to the news and your calls here while I still have time, I researched it before I took them as a sponsor.
[02:40:26.055 --> 02:40:29.998]  It's blacklistedherb.com and it is just an amazing compound produced
[02:40:45.116 --> 02:40:49.138]  It's like these mineral deposits in the mountains from plants and fungus.
[02:40:49.618 --> 02:40:51.359]  It's a complex compound.
[02:40:51.919 --> 02:40:55.341]  It's really good stuff with the trace minerals and key enzymes.
[02:40:57.041 --> 02:41:08.927]  I've looked into it, but they've got a lot of other really powerful type of minerals and vitamins and things that are in their ionic form and solutions from science.
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:13.462]  Illinois made this offer as easy for you as possible.
[02:41:13.982 --> 02:41:15.102]  No credit card number, no nothing.
[02:41:15.122 --> 02:41:16.223]  They just send you the invoice.
[02:41:16.243 --> 02:41:17.764]  You get a three-month supply.
[02:41:17.864 --> 02:41:20.605]  You get three months to decide if you like it.
[02:41:20.965 --> 02:41:22.146]  If not, you don't pay for it.
[02:41:22.646 --> 02:41:24.967]  Now, you cannot beat that, okay?
[02:41:25.407 --> 02:41:31.870]  You cannot beat that deal for chelicine that comes from this compound.
[02:41:32.410 --> 02:41:33.251]  And the primary
[02:41:35.201 --> 02:41:39.042]  active that comes out of this stuff is something called fulvic acid.
[02:41:39.062 --> 02:41:44.023]  Fulvic acid are created from plant deposits and provides the body with amazing properties.
[02:41:44.063 --> 02:41:54.885]  Researchers believe the cells then function at significantly higher levels and interestingly fulvic acid is also the most powerful natural electrolyte carrier known to science.
[02:41:54.945 --> 02:41:59.845]  And it just gets into, it's not just the bottom of the minerals, it's the key little connectors.
[02:42:00.686 --> 02:42:02.646]  It's basically what all this comes down to and it's a key
[02:42:03.462 --> 02:42:05.863]  Alex in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:42:28.522 --> 02:42:29.262]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:42:29.302 --> 02:42:35.144]  Let me start off by saying God bless you, and if you weren't here, the movement would definitely be at least ten years back.
[02:42:36.625 --> 02:42:37.205]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:42:37.225 --> 02:42:37.745]  God bless you.
[02:42:39.406 --> 02:42:43.187]  I was wondering, have you heard of a guy named Leo Zagami?
[02:42:44.928 --> 02:42:48.869]  I have heard the name, and while it's percolating in the back of my mind, I refresh my memory.
[02:42:49.890 --> 02:42:56.532]  Well, he was supposed to be the next heir to the infamous P2 Masonic Lodge in Italy.
[02:42:57.413 --> 02:42:59.234]  That's right, I heard him on air, yeah.
[02:42:59.854 --> 02:43:02.115]  Right, and I was wondering, what do you think?
[02:43:02.135 --> 02:43:07.096]  Do you think he's genuine, or do you think he's still working for them, trying to accomplish something?
[02:43:07.596 --> 02:43:09.077]  I'm not really sure what to do with this.
[02:43:09.137 --> 02:43:15.039]  I'll put it to you this way, you hear about that guy in upstate New York that was running around saying he was a Rockefeller?
[02:43:16.683 --> 02:43:22.187]  I remember going to college and it was always funny saying they were an aster or they just needed to stay at your house.
[02:43:22.287 --> 02:43:29.794]  I'm not saying he's like that, but that's why individuals who claim they're part of the Illuminati or the New World Order and they're now out doing this.
[02:43:31.475 --> 02:43:40.227]  The Globals have weird rules and they generally don't kill you if you've never served them, never worked for them, but if you've been with them and you shoot your mouth off, they kill you in a New York minute.
[02:43:41.188 --> 02:43:46.035]  And a lot of what I've heard him say a few times about the Illuminati and the way it works is very accurate.
[02:43:47.227 --> 02:43:55.473]  But there's always these types who, you know, this individual has this special knowledge, you can only verify it through them, and it's all this wild stuff.
[02:43:56.414 --> 02:43:57.835]  I always hold that suspect.
[02:43:58.255 --> 02:44:02.919]  But what he says sounds pretty credible, a lot of it does, but I haven't really followed him enough to comment on it.
[02:44:03.139 --> 02:44:06.261]  But I'm always suspect, just generally, of that whole genre.
[02:44:06.301 --> 02:44:08.242]  Sir, so much is open source.
[02:44:08.803 --> 02:44:14.487]  You see, you've got the mainstream media, but then you've got policy papers, think tank, white papers, you've got
[02:44:15.572 --> 02:44:32.419]  You know, internet 2 meetings, RFID conferences in Chicago, and I could spend 2-3 hours reading the transcripts, and it's, we all will have our own government, yeah we'll make them all do it, they'll submit, we're gonna have all the corporations just adopted by fiat in a governmental role, yeah great, I mean it's just all out in the open.
[02:44:32.998 --> 02:44:40.543]  So see, I go off all that, and I could never even cover it all, but see, I'm always right, because I'm just going off public source stuff.
[02:44:40.563 --> 02:44:51.890]  See, they can have secret decisions made in the White House, or at Skull and Bones, or at Bohemian Grove, or at Bilderberg, and these interlocking roundtables, but the implementation is going to be seen.
[02:44:52.290 --> 02:45:00.816]  It's like, you could always tell in a war what orders were given by the Wolf's Lair when you're fighting Germany, because you could see the manifestation of the troop movement.
[02:45:02.012 --> 02:45:06.335]  Now, you can't get too obsessed with that, because they can do fake trip movements to fool you.
[02:45:06.555 --> 02:45:11.899]  But the globalists don't even really do that, because they know most people aren't even aware that it's a military operation they're running against us.
[02:45:12.280 --> 02:45:17.643]  So you can see the basic implementation of everything right there, without even going to their own documents.
[02:45:17.663 --> 02:45:22.167]  I can just look at it, know what they're doing, and then surprise, surprise, the documents say exactly that.
[02:45:22.427 --> 02:45:24.288]  Because they got a big operation.
[02:45:24.588 --> 02:45:25.269]  So when people say,
[02:45:25.928 --> 02:45:27.449]  You conspiracy terrorists are crazy!
[02:45:27.469 --> 02:45:29.291]  They could never keep something this big secret!
[02:45:29.831 --> 02:45:30.372]  Well, it's true!
[02:45:30.412 --> 02:45:31.453]  They don't keep it secret!
[02:45:31.593 --> 02:45:35.716]  The Pentagon ran drills, applied hijack jets to the World Trade Center for martial law in 77!
[02:45:36.297 --> 02:45:37.678]  They ran them on the day of 9-11!
[02:45:38.339 --> 02:45:40.340]  Uh, you know, they've, they've, they've, they've shut it all!
[02:45:40.380 --> 02:45:41.281]  They've done it all, man!
[02:45:42.282 --> 02:45:43.223]  Yep, exactly.
[02:45:43.423 --> 02:45:45.405]  And, um, another thing.
[02:45:45.485 --> 02:45:50.309]  I've been looking into a lot of this stuff about the World Council of Churches.
[02:45:50.956 --> 02:45:57.539]  And I've noticed a lot of... I've been to a lot of different churches, and I've noticed a lot of them have Illuminati symbols all over them.
[02:45:57.579 --> 02:45:58.939]  I went back to one of my old churches.
[02:45:59.319 --> 02:46:03.261]  There was the pyramid with the eye of Osiris in the middle of it.
[02:46:04.101 --> 02:46:08.083]  I went back there before I knew about any of... I was going there when I was young.
[02:46:08.123 --> 02:46:09.143]  I didn't know about any of this.
[02:46:09.443 --> 02:46:10.284]  I was shocked!
[02:46:10.824 --> 02:46:18.247]  And then I found out, oh, yeah, a lot of... Well, I'll tell you right now, most big pastors, and I mean most, at big churches are Satanists.
[02:46:18.923 --> 02:46:22.325]  I mean, they're not even Luciferians, and they're running, and people hear this.
[02:46:22.665 --> 02:46:24.106]  Folks, how much other stuff have I told you?
[02:46:24.326 --> 02:46:27.788]  See, that's the kind of thing where I could prove it, but it would take hours of history.
[02:46:28.008 --> 02:46:37.573]  But see, you ever seen Dragnet made in the early 90s with Tom Hanks and, what's his name, where the big preacher's really a devil worshiper?
[02:46:38.033 --> 02:46:39.854]  See, that's Hollywood's joke on us.
[02:46:40.643 --> 02:46:46.267]  Or the Order of the Bell, which is a knock-off on Skull and Bones where, you know, the big preacher is the leader of it.
[02:46:46.848 --> 02:46:49.630]  You see, that's a big joke to them, man.
[02:46:49.930 --> 02:46:51.591]  Where do you think Satanists would try to be?
[02:46:52.132 --> 02:46:55.374]  Police, police chiefs, CIA chiefs, pastors.
[02:46:55.434 --> 02:46:57.036]  I know a lot of them, a lot of them.
[02:46:57.076 --> 02:46:59.597]  They're really, and a lot of atheist people.
[02:46:59.637 --> 02:47:03.580]  See, the tricky thing is a lot of atheists aren't atheists at all.
[02:47:03.621 --> 02:47:04.521]  They're really Satanists.
[02:47:04.641 --> 02:47:06.983]  Oh no, they got pentagrams, they have orgies.
[02:47:07.423 --> 02:47:08.444]  It's a big party to them.
[02:47:08.504 --> 02:47:09.445]  No, no, absolutely.
[02:47:09.885 --> 02:47:12.646]  I'm friends with some of them, like we have theological debates.
[02:47:13.086 --> 02:47:20.768]  But it's acknowledged, like, yeah, they're everywhere, and a lot of them happen to be, like, the homosonic thing with Baphomet.
[02:47:21.008 --> 02:47:24.969]  The Freemasons aren't the only ones who worship Baphomet at the 33rd degree.
[02:47:25.189 --> 02:47:29.230]  There's people everywhere, you know, just kids who go to these weird S&M nightclubs.
[02:47:29.250 --> 02:47:30.910]  There are tattoos of Baphomet all over them.
[02:47:31.450 --> 02:47:35.511]  You know, and it's very widespread, and they're at all... Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:47:36.337 --> 02:47:37.377]  And it's just like the Masons.
[02:47:37.457 --> 02:47:38.717]  Most Masons are good people.
[02:47:38.757 --> 02:47:39.598]  They're compartmentalized.
[02:47:39.618 --> 02:47:40.418]  They're paying dues.
[02:47:40.438 --> 02:47:42.878]  They don't know about the higher levels above the 33rd degree.
[02:47:42.898 --> 02:47:45.159]  And it's the same thing with the Pagans.
[02:47:45.339 --> 02:47:49.200]  You know, you've got the little Pagans out worshipping a tree, and they think they're friendly.
[02:47:49.220 --> 02:47:50.780]  And you go, hey, the Druids sacrificed.
[02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:52.460]  Hey, the Babylonians did.
[02:47:52.500 --> 02:47:53.320]  Hey, it's all the same.
[02:47:53.340 --> 02:47:54.521]  And they're like, shut up!
[02:47:54.561 --> 02:47:56.181]  You're just trying to besmirch us!
[02:47:56.621 --> 02:47:57.541]  And I'm like, no, no, no, no.
[02:47:57.561 --> 02:47:58.661]  You're like the Masons.
[02:47:59.622 --> 02:48:01.322]  I mean, I had great-grandfathers who were Masons.
[02:48:01.342 --> 02:48:01.902]  They didn't know.
[02:48:03.061 --> 02:48:08.343]  Now, later when they found out, they told my dad, you know, hey, don't, don't, don't be involved in this, because they had a conscience.
[02:48:09.203 --> 02:48:12.144]  But the point is, is that it's the same thing with the pagans.
[02:48:12.164 --> 02:48:14.385]  You're in the, you're a porch pagan, folks.
[02:48:15.185 --> 02:48:19.787]  There is no such thing, as Anton LaVey said, rightfully, as white and black magic.
[02:48:20.527 --> 02:48:23.048]  Okay, and if you're going to practice it, you might as well practice black magic.
[02:48:23.928 --> 02:48:27.229]  And that's what the real, real knowledge, if you get into that stuff, will tell you.
[02:48:27.913 --> 02:48:32.136]  Okay, you just might as well, because you're swimming in the pool, folks, it's all the deep end.
[02:48:32.456 --> 02:48:33.717]  There is no shallow end.
[02:48:33.917 --> 02:48:35.698]  There is no stick your toe in there, okay?
[02:48:35.718 --> 02:48:37.639]  All right, then, this stuff's real.
[02:48:37.659 --> 02:48:39.180]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:39.660 --> 02:48:42.042]  I know, and the outer people don't think there's anything going on.
[02:48:42.322 --> 02:48:44.003]  Believe me, it drives the whole world.
[02:48:48.985 --> 02:48:54.428]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.808 --> 02:49:02.432]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.146 --> 02:49:10.209]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.589 --> 02:49:22.034]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.334 --> 02:49:25.816]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.296 --> 02:49:28.217]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.557 --> 02:49:32.399]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:49.025 --> 02:51:51.668]  I'm just going to take three or four final calls and I'll have time to cover the news.
[02:51:51.708 --> 02:51:55.932]  But it's like China's one child rioters arrested.
[02:51:56.393 --> 02:51:58.054]  This is all the carbon tax, folks.
[02:51:58.475 --> 02:52:00.397]  It's going to be a new global tax on children.
[02:52:00.837 --> 02:52:02.239]  Implemented country by country.
[02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:04.481]  Mainstream News.
[02:52:05.649 --> 02:52:08.471]  Work, build, create new ID database for all U.S.
[02:52:08.511 --> 02:52:09.011]  citizens.
[02:52:09.071 --> 02:52:09.812]  Seen that news.
[02:52:10.252 --> 02:52:12.654]  Again, you think it's a worker card for illegals.
[02:52:13.154 --> 02:52:13.594]  Uh-uh.
[02:52:13.775 --> 02:52:15.476]  Citizens have to have it to have a job.
[02:52:15.816 --> 02:52:20.039]  Shit, everything they do, you think's for the illegals or for something else, and it's really against you.
[02:52:20.639 --> 02:52:21.440]  Man, they're slick.
[02:52:22.340 --> 02:52:23.281]  And it goes on.
[02:52:24.041 --> 02:52:24.722]  Papers, please.
[02:52:24.742 --> 02:52:26.663]  Your biometric data to get jobs.
[02:52:27.444 --> 02:52:29.825]  They got hover drones going in from Dallas to L.A.
[02:52:29.845 --> 02:52:30.386]  to London.
[02:52:30.746 --> 02:52:32.587]  The police are going to wear cameras on their heads.
[02:52:32.627 --> 02:52:33.828]  It's all about intimidation.
[02:52:34.318 --> 02:52:35.519]  It's all about creating fear.
[02:52:35.559 --> 02:52:36.680]  It's not about keeping you safe.
[02:52:38.321 --> 02:52:40.543]  Microsoft develops Big Brother software.
[02:52:40.563 --> 02:52:43.105]  It's just all these incredible stories.
[02:52:43.205 --> 02:52:48.569]  Dick did censor our story yesterday about Russo, Ron Paul should attack Giuliani in next debate.
[02:52:48.889 --> 02:52:53.352]  That's key info that needs to be well distributed.
[02:52:53.713 --> 02:52:54.874]  Help us get it out to people.
[02:52:55.574 --> 02:52:59.257]  Florida to electronically track Alzheimer patients with microchips embedded.
[02:53:01.471 --> 02:53:03.232]  This is the kind of news I have here in front of me.
[02:53:03.793 --> 02:53:04.734]  Digg censored this.
[02:53:04.814 --> 02:53:05.554]  This needs to get out.
[02:53:05.614 --> 02:53:06.795]  Only you can get it out, folks.
[02:53:07.236 --> 02:53:10.498]  Bush reauthorized martial law provisions, declares himself dictator.
[02:53:11.099 --> 02:53:11.779]  It's official.
[02:53:11.819 --> 02:53:12.860]  NAFTA is a treaty.
[02:53:14.341 --> 02:53:16.743]  FDA approves period suspension pill.
[02:53:16.763 --> 02:53:19.365]  I mean, no wonder women are all dying of breast cancer.
[02:53:19.385 --> 02:53:21.527]  It's massively linked to these birth control pills.
[02:53:21.867 --> 02:53:24.109]  And now you're going to suspend your menstrual cycle?
[02:53:24.549 --> 02:53:26.251]  Oh, that's going to be real good for you.
[02:53:27.471 --> 02:53:30.494]  When are you going to learn they're waging eugenics war against you women?
[02:53:31.187 --> 02:53:32.508]  And stop taking their garbage?
[02:53:34.770 --> 02:53:35.611]  Oh my gosh.
[02:53:36.572 --> 02:53:38.113]  I just am so worried about everything.
[02:53:39.254 --> 02:53:41.917]  Let's go to Steve in, well who's up next here?
[02:53:41.937 --> 02:53:42.698]  Steve in Louisiana?
[02:53:44.219 --> 02:53:44.900]  Steve in L.A.?
[02:53:44.920 --> 02:53:46.081]  Oh okay, I saw L.A.
[02:53:46.121 --> 02:53:46.301]  there.
[02:53:46.561 --> 02:53:47.382]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:53:48.763 --> 02:53:51.225]  Hey Alex, long time listener, first time caller.
[02:53:51.866 --> 02:53:56.370]  I've got a really important announcement about a Ron Paul rally
[02:53:56.863 --> 02:54:02.325]  It's going to take place in front of Bill Maher's studio on Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:54:02.365 --> 02:54:10.969]  We're going to be there to support Ron Paul in front of the studio in Hollywood where the show is being shot and we're going to try to get inside to the show as well.
[02:54:10.989 --> 02:54:15.711]  That's a good idea because then Bill Maher can say, boy, you barely got supporters and show a bunch of people out there.
[02:54:16.271 --> 02:54:17.692]  Well, that's exactly what we're going to do.
[02:54:17.712 --> 02:54:18.953]  Is the campaign behind this?
[02:54:18.993 --> 02:54:19.613]  Do they know about it?
[02:54:20.291 --> 02:54:25.593]  No, that's why the guy you had on today didn't say anything about it, and I consider that to be a good thing.
[02:54:25.613 --> 02:54:27.594]  It's been formed spontaneously.
[02:54:27.614 --> 02:54:30.635]  Yeah, but it'd be good to get them involved in it some way.
[02:54:30.655 --> 02:54:32.036]  Well, yeah, everybody should go.
[02:54:33.476 --> 02:54:35.197]  What studios does Mars shoot out of?
[02:54:36.457 --> 02:54:37.378]  Century City?
[02:54:38.398 --> 02:54:41.479]  No, this is going to be on Beverly Boulevard in Hollywood.
[02:54:41.579 --> 02:54:45.881]  Everyone can get the information by going to ronpaul.meetup.com.
[02:54:46.301 --> 02:54:47.482]  We did this via the Meetup.
[02:54:48.943 --> 02:54:52.346]  And so it's ronpaul.meetup.com and then slash 104.
[02:54:52.386 --> 02:54:58.530]  Yeah, you know the best way to do it is just go to ronpaul2008.com and then go into the information there.
[02:54:58.730 --> 02:55:00.131]  I'm going to let you go.
[02:55:00.171 --> 02:55:01.052]  I'm going to let you go.
[02:55:01.072 --> 02:55:01.592]  We're out of time.
[02:55:01.992 --> 02:55:03.613]  I'll be happy to plug it tomorrow for you, sir.
[02:55:04.254 --> 02:55:08.677]  The big thing here is that you can go there and he has a link to the meetup groups state by state.
[02:55:09.357 --> 02:55:09.818]  There you go.
[02:55:10.438 --> 02:55:13.680]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Wes in California.
[02:55:13.700 --> 02:55:14.601]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:55:15.208 --> 02:55:19.051]  Hey Alex, I'm in the Constitution Party, but I support Ron Paul for President.
[02:55:19.492 --> 02:55:19.712]  Good!
[02:55:19.732 --> 02:55:24.176]  I think this year we need to not run a candidate in that party or Libertarian Party.
[02:55:24.216 --> 02:55:26.398]  We need to go ahead and support Ron Paul instead.
[02:55:26.718 --> 02:55:27.158]  Exactly!
[02:55:27.198 --> 02:55:28.860]  Both those parties need to do that.
[02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:30.181]  Yeah, I know.
[02:55:30.221 --> 02:55:35.065]  You know, I hope maybe some Hollywood support will come out for Ron Paul.
[02:55:35.085 --> 02:55:36.226]  Maybe some commercials or something.
[02:55:36.266 --> 02:55:37.888]  Maybe some big actors will talk about him.
[02:55:39.349 --> 02:55:39.669]  I hear ya!
[02:55:39.749 --> 02:55:40.350]  I gotta jump!
[02:55:40.410 --> 02:55:41.431]  Patrick in Texas!
[02:55:41.811 --> 02:55:42.832]  Last caller, go ahead!
[02:55:44.873 --> 02:55:45.293]  He hung up.
[02:55:45.373 --> 02:55:46.414]  Okay, sorry, Wes.
[02:55:46.534 --> 02:55:49.235]  I was committed to take at least those calls there.
[02:55:49.255 --> 02:55:49.895]  Sorry to everybody else.
[02:55:49.915 --> 02:55:50.535]  We're out of time.
[02:55:51.335 --> 02:55:54.476]  And we will have Congresswoman Ron Paul on next Tuesday, by the way.
[02:55:54.796 --> 02:55:57.657]  We'll be back tomorrow, live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:58.118 --> 02:55:59.438]  Big guests, tons of news.
[02:55:59.698 --> 02:56:01.579]  We can never cover it all here on the radio.
[02:56:01.979 --> 02:56:09.801]  That's why InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com are so important.
[02:56:10.162 --> 02:56:13.983]  Each site has some of its own independent news every day from the other sites.
[02:56:14.603 --> 02:56:15.503]  Please spread the word.
[02:56:15.644 --> 02:56:16.724]  Help us in this fight.
[02:56:17.004 --> 02:56:19.065]  That's all we ask you because we're all in this together.
[02:56:19.325 --> 02:56:21.126]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:21.446 --> 02:56:23.487]  God bless you all.
[02:56:25.668 --> 02:56:30.550]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
