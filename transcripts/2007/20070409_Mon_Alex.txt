[00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:06.269]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:07.990]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.810]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:11.271]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:12.931]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:17.293]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.773 --> 00:00:21.854]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:40.994]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:41.214 --> 00:00:41.654]  Welcome.
[00:00:41.694 --> 00:00:48.818]  It is the ninth day of April 2007, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.043]  In the meantime, I do want to give you a chance to find out some of the guests that are coming on today.
[00:00:58.443 --> 00:01:01.765]  We have Jeff Rents joining us in the second hour.
[00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:12.299]  To talk about the colony collapse disorder with the honeybees, to get into his study of what is known as Morgellons.
[00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:14.241]  Is it real?
[00:01:14.342 --> 00:01:17.486]  I'm sure something's going on in many of the cases and other cases.
[00:01:17.586 --> 00:01:19.709]  Is it a schizophrenics out there?
[00:01:20.908 --> 00:01:25.473]  And is it nanotech particuli growing in the human body?
[00:01:26.574 --> 00:01:34.782]  I've got a bunch of different mainstream media reports warning of just these type of events and the dangers of nanotech.
[00:01:35.843 --> 00:01:37.465]  So we'll be going over that.
[00:01:37.845 --> 00:01:43.011]  We're also scheduled to have one of the pilots for 9-11 Truth on the show in the third hour.
[00:01:48.294 --> 00:01:52.397]  Again, it's getting harder and harder on the show to cover all the news I want to get to.
[00:01:53.598 --> 00:02:16.897]  I woke up this morning to learn, now I already knew this, we told you this two years ago, we got the official TxDOT documents, and we went to TxDOT meetings, and we went to some of their board meetings, and we got the maps that showed 8,000 miles of Texas roads, that's more than half of roads, will be toll roads, existing roads.
[00:02:17.632 --> 00:02:38.409]  In Austin, and this is going nationwide, but I want you to get an idea for an average-sized city of over a million people, metro, every, let me say this again, every single major road you will have to use a toll road on average to go just a few miles in the city.
[00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:42.553]  Where I live, I won't be able to go even a couple
[00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:46.154]  Miles, not even a mile.
[00:02:46.674 --> 00:02:50.336]  In fact, I'll have toll roads on three sides of me within less than a half a mile.
[00:02:53.038 --> 00:03:00.683]  This is a total grid, and as soon as they got caught planning this, they lied and said they weren't going to do it, and it was all a conspiracy theory.
[00:03:01.303 --> 00:03:04.465]  And we told you that it was not, that we had their documents, and we showed them to you.
[00:03:05.126 --> 00:03:10.788]  But Americans have been trained to rationalize, to procrastinate, to deny a threat.
[00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:15.110]  And so they said, okay, there's going to be no toll roads on existing roads in Austin.
[00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:18.832]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've now announced that they're taking Mopac.
[00:03:19.852 --> 00:03:25.555]  The entire, I mean, this is a six-lane highway right down the middle of Austin, Texas.
[00:03:25.695 --> 00:03:31.758]  It is, if it's not traffic time, you can go from South Austin to North Austin in about ten minutes.
[00:03:31.818 --> 00:03:32.698]  It's wonderful.
[00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.880]  I mean, I grew up in Dallas, folks.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.161]  Mopac is just great.
[00:03:37.182 --> 00:03:41.485]  I grew up where it took an hour to go anywhere because nothing was a straight shot.
[00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:42.525]  This is a straight shot.
[00:03:43.226 --> 00:03:45.207]  They're grabbing it and turning it into a toll road.
[00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.651]  Foreign-owned company, the whole nine yards.
[00:03:52.993 --> 00:03:58.216]  And sure enough, they're going to block the exits off of it and build big concrete walls.
[00:03:59.177 --> 00:04:00.278]  And the construction
[00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:04.798]  Because, of course, they're going to add bus lanes to it.
[00:04:05.198 --> 00:04:07.720]  The construction will devastate the road.
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.861]  Well, let me see.
[00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:11.162]  It took them 20 years to build Ben White.
[00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:16.226]  And it'll take them years to build this.
[00:04:16.246 --> 00:04:16.766]  I don't know.
[00:04:16.786 --> 00:04:17.647]  Let's be conservative.
[00:04:18.627 --> 00:04:19.828]  Let's say they do it fast.
[00:04:20.148 --> 00:04:20.469]  10 years.
[00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.492]  And, of course, they're already phasing out cash.
[00:04:25.552 --> 00:04:26.893]  First, they say you can use cash.
[00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:29.312]  Then they start phasing out the cash flow.
[00:04:29.332 --> 00:04:34.055]  They say, well, if you're going to use money, going to use coins, going to use dollars, you got to pay double.
[00:04:34.456 --> 00:04:35.636]  They do that up in Illinois.
[00:04:36.437 --> 00:04:36.797]  All right.
[00:04:36.937 --> 00:04:40.620]  And we'll get into global toll roads because it's happening everywhere.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.601]  And also, this is London Guardian.
[00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:45.903]  Revolution, flash mobs and brain chips.
[00:04:46.564 --> 00:04:48.365]  A grim vision of the future.
[00:04:48.825 --> 00:04:50.586]  I'm going to cover this first when we get back.
[00:04:51.247 --> 00:04:52.307]  Honeybee collapse.
[00:04:52.387 --> 00:04:53.288]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:53.628 --> 00:04:55.029]  It's all part of your New World Order.
[00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.471]  It's all part of the gifts of the New World Order.
[00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:06.943]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:05:07.103 --> 00:05:15.190]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:22.497]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:05:22.677 --> 00:05:23.958]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:05:24.038 --> 00:05:29.942]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:35.225]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:05:35.325 --> 00:05:44.231]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:05:44.472 --> 00:05:47.774]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:53.878]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:05:57.281 --> 00:05:59.723]  It's here.
[00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:10.012]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.372 --> 00:06:17.958]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.692 --> 00:06:25.734]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:37.558]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.878 --> 00:06:41.800]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.780]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:44.101 --> 00:06:47.942]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:08.335]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[00:07:08.555 --> 00:07:12.598]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:14.980]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[00:07:15.341 --> 00:07:22.326]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[00:07:22.686 --> 00:07:25.289]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[00:07:25.549 --> 00:07:29.073]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[00:07:29.334 --> 00:07:32.257]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:07:32.557 --> 00:07:37.243]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.125]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:07:39.385 --> 00:07:42.829]  You'll find Non-X Gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X
[00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:51.315]  In the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, Wayne Reed, and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[00:07:51.775 --> 00:07:54.077]  Or online at drugstore.com.
[00:07:54.477 --> 00:07:59.921]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:08:01.482 --> 00:08:03.804]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.344 --> 00:08:07.126]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:28.935 --> 00:08:42.806]  I started getting horrified phone calls at my home office early this morning as friends, family, people that work here at this office learned that the major expressway, MOPAC,
[00:08:44.446 --> 00:08:50.347]  Named after the railway that goes to the middle of the city, was going to be seized and turned into a giant toll road.
[00:08:51.168 --> 00:08:52.848]  And of course, there's the big PR push.
[00:08:53.008 --> 00:08:56.509]  Oh, there's going to be two meetings this week, public meetings, and then we're going to decide.
[00:08:57.129 --> 00:09:02.150]  Folks, you could have a billion people at one of these meetings and they would go ahead with it.
[00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.711]  The country has been bought and paid for and sold.
[00:09:05.391 --> 00:09:10.352]  So when you go to the meetings, let them know that you understand they're bought and paid for and that the government's criminal.
[00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:21.807]  By the way, Dow Chemical, our biggest chemical company in the U.S., is being sold right now for $50 billion to the Saudis and a consortium of four other Arab nations.
[00:09:22.627 --> 00:09:27.211]  I literally have an inch-thick stack of news of U.S.
[00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:33.436]  companies going international or being bought by the Dutch, the British, the Japanese, the Arabs.
[00:09:34.517 --> 00:09:37.039]  And it's just like, remember 20-30 years ago?
[00:09:38.587 --> 00:09:55.398]  I remember even back when I was in college, just 15 years ago, 14 years ago, you could go down to Mexico over the weekend with 50 bucks and your hotel room might be $10 a night and you can get a couple meals a day and cold beer and wander around and maybe even buy a couple souvenirs.
[00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:59.581]  When I was a child, it was even more depressed down there.
[00:10:02.283 --> 00:10:07.266]  But the Mexicans knew what it meant to have a low-valued peso.
[00:10:07.879 --> 00:10:08.299]  They knew.
[00:10:08.719 --> 00:10:10.300]  Yuppies don't, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.020]  Yuppies don't.
[00:10:13.421 --> 00:10:15.041]  And I've even talked to yuppies on the street.
[00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:17.602]  They'll smile and giggle and go, well, maybe toll roads are good.
[00:10:17.642 --> 00:10:18.482]  We need good roads.
[00:10:18.902 --> 00:10:23.884]  They're trained to accept anything psychologically they claim power over.
[00:10:24.284 --> 00:10:27.865]  Psychologically, they just decide everything is good for them.
[00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:29.666]  Oh, I'll let them retina scan me.
[00:10:30.146 --> 00:10:33.227]  Oh, I'll let them retina scan my kids to get school lunches or thumbprint.
[00:10:34.007 --> 00:10:39.371]  Oh, the optometrist wants to scan my eye to put it in a database to make sure I don't have a detached retina.
[00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:42.814]  And oh, they admit they keep it in a database and give the data away and sell it.
[00:10:42.854 --> 00:10:44.375]  But I'll just go along.
[00:10:44.835 --> 00:10:45.676]  I've nothing to hide.
[00:10:46.556 --> 00:10:48.518]  Oh, you know, amnesty is what we need.
[00:10:48.558 --> 00:10:49.719]  We need to get rid of the borders.
[00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:50.939]  It'll be good for the economy.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.321]  They just accept everything.
[00:10:55.383 --> 00:10:55.903]  Well, good!
[00:10:55.943 --> 00:10:58.625]  You go ahead and accept in every major city in this country.
[00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:05.457]  Every single road being turned into a toll road, and transponders tracking you and taxing you.
[00:11:05.837 --> 00:11:20.402]  But when you slack-jawed yuppies can't pay for the tolls anymore, and when you slack-jawed yuppies can't pay for your apartment anymore, because the middle class is going to be completely eliminated.
[00:11:21.022 --> 00:11:22.742]  You just remember that.
[00:11:22.802 --> 00:11:23.543]  Okay, you know what?
[00:11:23.603 --> 00:11:24.843]  I'm already going into hyperbole.
[00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:26.844]  I'm already getting angry.
[00:11:26.904 --> 00:11:27.584]  I'm already getting
[00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:29.753]  Disgusted.
[00:11:31.494 --> 00:11:33.954]  And it's because I'm just sick of it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:34.395 --> 00:11:39.696]  We got Sal Costello, Texas Toll Party, briefly joining us, coming up in about 20 minutes to go through this.
[00:11:39.776 --> 00:11:46.718]  It's in the Statesman Today, an article telling you how it's needed, and how they have to, and it's just MOPAC.
[00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:57.241]  The official TxDOT documents, 360, William Cannon, Lamar, Congress, everything.
[00:11:58.018 --> 00:12:01.040]  Okay, they've already grabbed Mopac North, okay?
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.082]  And of course they promised two years ago that that was all a conspiracy theory, they wouldn't.
[00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:17.928]  And of course it's a conspiracy theory that Bush is now pushing for total complete amnesty, and they even have illegals out protesting him, saying it restricts him, and that's now fooling most of the neocon conservatives.
[00:12:18.894 --> 00:12:23.776]  that have barely got pulses left and uh... and so they're now suddenly for the amnesty.
[00:12:24.056 --> 00:12:28.837]  I mean these dog and pony shows work on you people surprisingly well!
[00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:38.740]  I mean these tricks are pretty simple and they do them over and over and over and over again.
[00:12:39.241 --> 00:12:40.581]  Look, I could read this whole article.
[00:12:40.641 --> 00:12:41.941]  I could talk for three hours about it.
[00:12:41.981 --> 00:12:43.062]  It's a complete nightmare.
[00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:44.622]  Let me give you the breakdown.
[00:12:44.682 --> 00:12:46.663]  I want Paul Watson to do an article on this.
[00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:54.766]  Revolution, flash mobs, and brain chips.
[00:12:55.667 --> 00:12:58.649]  A grim vision of the future.
[00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.212]  Information chips implanted in the brain.
[00:13:03.732 --> 00:13:05.994]  Electromagnetic pulse weapons.
[00:13:06.514 --> 00:13:09.276]  The middle classes becoming revolutionary.
[00:13:09.977 --> 00:13:13.059]  Taking on the role of Marx's proletariat.
[00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:18.122]  The populations of countries in the Middle East increasing by 132 percent, while Europe drops
[00:13:22.034 --> 00:13:23.476]  And fertility falls.
[00:13:24.737 --> 00:13:25.998]  Yeah, it's the death of the West.
[00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:27.039]  Bye-bye.
[00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:31.143]  Pleasant dreams abide thy eyes as you go into the Netherlands.
[00:13:36.648 --> 00:13:40.132]  The Niederwald, I guess, as you disappear over the hill in the black abyss.
[00:13:40.172 --> 00:13:40.592]  I'm sorry.
[00:13:40.912 --> 00:13:43.555]  The population of countries in the Middle East
[00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:56.110]  increasing by 132 percent while Europe's drops and its fertility falls flash mobs group rapidly mobilized by criminal gangs or terrorist groups of the flash mobs.
[00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.570]  I wonder why they'll be flashing.
[00:13:58.371 --> 00:14:00.251]  Now let me just analyze that first paragraph.
[00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:07.213]  This is a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 page article.
[00:14:07.573 --> 00:14:09.614]  Every paragraph I could talk about for 30 minutes.
[00:14:09.974 --> 00:14:12.215]  Let's just, and this is the Ministry of Defense,
[00:14:13.434 --> 00:14:17.956]  And this is what they say things will be like in just 30 years.
[00:14:20.477 --> 00:14:24.638]  And wait until you hear the predictions they make for just six years away and five years away.
[00:14:25.858 --> 00:14:28.999]  And I have to say I agree with much of these predictions by the way.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.000]  I mean I'm freaked out.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.321]  I woke up at 3 a.m.
[00:14:32.341 --> 00:14:33.581]  last night in a cold sweat.
[00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:35.662]  I went and looked at my family.
[00:14:35.682 --> 00:14:42.084]  I was wandering around in the kitchen and I woke up this morning
[00:14:44.444 --> 00:14:48.606]  And I just can't believe what they're setting up.
[00:14:48.726 --> 00:14:50.507]  It is so horrid.
[00:14:52.048 --> 00:14:54.870]  And the elite have totally written off the West.
[00:14:54.970 --> 00:15:09.518]  They have decided to fully sacrifice the West into the New World Order, using our literal substance to fertilize and to pay off
[00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:17.951]  And to energize these global multinational corporations that are just going to manage the world and play remaining blocks off against each other.
[00:15:20.092 --> 00:15:24.395]  Revolution, flash mobs and brain chips, a grim vision of the future.
[00:15:25.096 --> 00:15:27.157]  Information chips and planet in the brain.
[00:15:27.978 --> 00:15:28.638]  That's how it starts.
[00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.640]  London Guardian, biggest newspaper in England.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.281]  Electromagnetic pulse weapons.
[00:15:33.922 --> 00:15:35.903]  The middle class is becoming revolutionary.
[00:15:36.384 --> 00:15:38.065]  And then it goes on to say because they won't exist.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.141]  Taking on the role of Marxist proletariat.
[00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:45.023]  See, they make revolution in a Ministry of Defense document.
[00:15:45.163 --> 00:15:49.785]  If you rebel, if you unite, it must be communist.
[00:15:50.585 --> 00:15:52.326]  Now, I thought communism was gone.
[00:15:52.446 --> 00:15:52.786]  No.
[00:15:53.646 --> 00:16:00.269]  As history shows, there were revolutionary groups of middle class forming in Europe, and forming in England, and forming in Russia.
[00:16:01.411 --> 00:16:06.433]  And so the big banks came in and took control of those revolutions and said, oh, we'll commutize it.
[00:16:06.713 --> 00:16:10.694]  We'll have a bank robber running things with a club foot like Joseph Stalin.
[00:16:11.975 --> 00:16:14.796]  We'll have a Hitler doing things, a gunner snipe.
[00:16:14.836 --> 00:16:18.637]  We'll have a National Socialism, a Communist, all of it.
[00:16:19.315 --> 00:16:29.399]  And we'll take you off your land, and we're going to get the elite, and we're going to force you off your little 40 acres, your little 50 acres, where you've been peasants for a thousand years, but independent and happy.
[00:16:29.419 --> 00:16:33.801]  And we're going to send you into these big labor camps to die, or we're going to send you to forced labor camps.
[00:16:33.821 --> 00:16:34.301]  How does that sound?
[00:16:36.282 --> 00:16:37.643]  Well, that's a great reform.
[00:16:38.463 --> 00:16:39.504]  And that's what they're going to do, folks.
[00:16:39.544 --> 00:16:45.266]  They're colonizing us with Latin Americans who've already been filled with Marxism and Leninism.
[00:16:47.265 --> 00:16:48.386]  All financed by the government.
[00:16:48.406 --> 00:16:49.747]  Again, our government put Mao into power.
[00:16:50.568 --> 00:16:55.013]  And they're going to bring them in here and they're about to vote in Los Angeles for total gun bans.
[00:16:56.074 --> 00:16:57.675]  Again, the rent-a-mob.
[00:16:58.196 --> 00:17:00.137]  That's why I don't like the illegal aliens.
[00:17:01.138 --> 00:17:04.782]  It's not the macho arrogance and the hate of America and all the rest of it.
[00:17:04.822 --> 00:17:05.583]  That irritates me.
[00:17:05.943 --> 00:17:07.885]  It's the fact that they're going to vote for gun control.
[00:17:08.565 --> 00:17:11.128]  And they're going to vote for totally wilding borders and North American Union.
[00:17:11.684 --> 00:17:13.045]  Because they think it hurts America.
[00:17:13.085 --> 00:17:17.727]  Because they think America itself hurt them, not the parasites that controlled America.
[00:17:17.947 --> 00:17:19.088]  They're not differentiating.
[00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:24.070]  And so it goes through all this, by the way.
[00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.871]  The Ministry of Defense report.
[00:17:26.971 --> 00:17:28.912]  The official Ministry of Defense projection.
[00:17:30.693 --> 00:17:38.557]  This is what they say they believe is going to happen with all their supercomputers and wargaming and all their sociologists and psychiatrists and experts.
[00:17:39.822 --> 00:17:41.664]  And, uh, I agree with them, and you know why?
[00:17:41.704 --> 00:17:51.552]  Because the government's behind this, and it's going to take natural conflicts and natural tribalist instincts, and they're going to accentuate and basically add nitrous oxide to the engine component.
[00:17:52.412 --> 00:17:56.816]  And they're going to take a car that'll go 160 miles an hour up to 220 miles an hour.
[00:17:58.197 --> 00:17:59.378]  And it's going to be bad, folks.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.400]  It's going to be bad.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:09.146]  We're going to face armored SWAT teams hunting down those that don't want to be part of the system, while, it's just, it's hell on earth, folks.
[00:18:10.134 --> 00:18:17.657]  All these little zip-faced kids playing the violent video games, they're going to be roid head with devil tattoos all over them in black uniforms.
[00:18:18.197 --> 00:18:20.478]  They'll live in the armored central areas of the cities.
[00:18:21.038 --> 00:18:22.679]  All the pleasures provided to them.
[00:18:23.459 --> 00:18:26.080]  Just punks, never amounted to nothing, ruling over us.
[00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:28.281]  Just hell on earth, folks.
[00:18:28.481 --> 00:18:29.641]  Absolute hell on earth.
[00:18:31.882 --> 00:18:35.744]  I just read one paragraph of this and I can't even do it justice.
[00:18:37.604 --> 00:18:38.765]  And it just goes on from there.
[00:18:40.387 --> 00:18:42.248]  This is the world in 30 years.
[00:18:42.368 --> 00:18:53.335]  Time envisioned by a Ministry of Defense team responsible for painting a picture of the future strategic context likely to face Britain's armed forces.
[00:18:53.795 --> 00:18:56.317]  It includes an analysis of the key risk and shocks.
[00:18:57.818 --> 00:19:10.025]  Rear Admiral Chris Perry, head of the MOD's Development Concepts and Doctrine Center, which drew up the report, describes the assessments as probability-based rather than predictive.
[00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:21.234]  The 90 page report comments on widely discussed issues such as the growing economic importance of India and China and the militarization of space and even what it calls
[00:19:22.063 --> 00:19:29.128]  Declining news quality, which is by design the dumbing down, with the rise of internet-enabled citizen journalist.
[00:19:29.268 --> 00:19:29.568]  Aha!
[00:19:29.628 --> 00:19:31.129]  Yes, it means you don't control the info.
[00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:42.537]  And pressure to release stories at the expense of facts that includes others, including frightening, some reassuring, potential developments that are not so often discussed.
[00:19:43.818 --> 00:19:45.499]  And I'll continue going over this.
[00:19:47.592 --> 00:19:56.110]  But don't worry, the Ministry, as the Department of Defense report said in 2000 in the U.S., will fit you with your brain chip, and that's the solution.
[00:20:02.699 --> 00:20:04.760]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:14.303]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.763 --> 00:20:21.945]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.674 --> 00:20:28.176]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.656 --> 00:20:39.499]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:42.320]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.220]  For more information, call 702-953-0202.
[00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:48.801]  We're good to go.
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:14.400]  I think so.
[00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:29.511]  We're good to go.
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.943]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:22:05.283 --> 00:22:08.165]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:22:08.386 --> 00:22:14.591]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:22:14.971 --> 00:22:22.277]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:22:22.478 --> 00:22:26.501]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:22:26.821 --> 00:22:32.363]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.

[00:23:01.451 --> 00:23:06.235]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[00:23:06.475 --> 00:23:10.439]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[00:23:10.719 --> 00:23:17.004]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:23:17.265 --> 00:23:21.628]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.

[00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:15.206]  I'll tell you right now.
[00:24:16.747 --> 00:24:24.449]  When the New World Order's raced to dump everybody down and seize all the assets by hook or by crook to consolidate power, they've gone too far.
[00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.730]  It's not going to take 30 years for things to unravel.
[00:24:28.511 --> 00:24:30.591]  Things are going to unravel a lot faster than that.
[00:24:33.152 --> 00:24:34.773]  And the government's going to lose control.
[00:24:34.793 --> 00:24:39.654]  Alright, continuing with this revolution.
[00:24:39.774 --> 00:24:44.436]  Flash mobs, brain chips, and a grim vision of the future.
[00:24:44.476 --> 00:24:45.676]  And I tried last night to
[00:24:46.531 --> 00:24:48.073]  Find the report itself.
[00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:50.014]  I found a boiled-down version of it.
[00:24:50.034 --> 00:24:51.656]  We need to get that 90-page report.
[00:24:52.016 --> 00:24:54.759]  Get it posted on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:24:57.161 --> 00:25:05.349]  An electromagnetic... It goes on... The MOD's Development Concepts and Doctrine Center, which drew up the report, describes the assessments as probable based.
[00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:18.015]  The 90-page report comments on widely discussed issues such as the growing economic importance of India and China, the militarization of space, and even what it calls declining news quality with the rise of internet-enabled citizen journalists.
[00:25:18.055 --> 00:25:21.577]  Let me tell you, a lot of our news is a lot better quality than your stuff.
[00:25:21.657 --> 00:25:22.657]  Okay, you control freaks?
[00:25:24.578 --> 00:25:32.462]  Citizen journalists and pressure to release stories at the expense of facts, it includes others, some frightening, some reassuring potential developments.
[00:25:35.413 --> 00:25:44.404]  So there's a swing at the alternative media when the Ministry of Defense and our government media has been caught putting out tons of fake news and bought off reporters.
[00:25:44.484 --> 00:25:47.687]  So, yeah, you are being challenged in the future.
[00:25:47.728 --> 00:25:51.972]  You thought you'd use the internet as nothing but a worldwide wiretap, but it backfired on you.
[00:25:52.173 --> 00:25:53.915]  That's a blade that cuts both ways.
[00:25:55.271 --> 00:26:05.264]  New weapons and electromagnetic pulse will probably become operational by 2035, able to destroy all communication systems in selected area, or be used against a world city.
[00:26:05.956 --> 00:26:07.757]  That's been around for 30-plus years.
[00:26:07.777 --> 00:26:08.817]  I mean, what are they talking about?
[00:26:09.017 --> 00:26:10.937]  I guess they mean in the hands of rogues.
[00:26:11.578 --> 00:26:24.782]  Such as an international business service hub, the development of neutron weapons, which destroy living organisms, but not buildings, might make a weapon of choice for extreme ethnic cleansing in an increasingly populated world.
[00:26:25.942 --> 00:26:27.962]  Oh, in an increasingly populated world.
[00:26:27.982 --> 00:26:28.463]  Well, let me see.
[00:26:28.483 --> 00:26:29.763]  Who's got neutron bombs?
[00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:33.250]  The United States developed them in the 60s.
[00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.871]  They were made public in the late 70s.
[00:26:36.311 --> 00:26:40.493]  And there's a large arsenal of them, contrary to popular knowledge.
[00:26:41.133 --> 00:26:42.554]  Now, let's expand on that.
[00:26:42.594 --> 00:26:51.978]  It's well known that South Africa, Israel, Russia, France, and England also have neutron bombs, and that Japan's secretly been working on things even more advanced.
[00:26:51.998 --> 00:26:53.919]  And if you don't know, Japan's got a nuclear arsenal.
[00:26:54.159 --> 00:26:57.300]  I've got a bridge I want to sell you, by the way, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.901]  China's got more sophisticated weapons.
[00:27:00.401 --> 00:27:05.904]  And who writes about using race-specific bioweapons and superweapons and things for ethnic cleansing?
[00:27:05.944 --> 00:27:07.404]  Why, the PNAC boys do.
[00:27:07.725 --> 00:27:13.927]  And we know that Israel has been caught buying bioweapons, race-specific, from South Africa in the 80s.
[00:27:14.748 --> 00:27:17.749]  So, again, everything they talk about is them.
[00:27:18.089 --> 00:27:20.010]  All the big threats they talk about is them.
[00:27:21.871 --> 00:27:24.092]  But don't worry, they'll protect you from the threats they pose.
[00:27:27.717 --> 00:27:28.678]  And it just goes on.
[00:27:32.239 --> 00:27:33.020]  New weapons.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:46.706]  It goes on to say, um, for ethnic cleansing in an increasingly populated world, the use of unmanned weapons platforms, which again, the entire Air Force within just a few years, its main force will be robotic.
[00:27:47.346 --> 00:27:48.027]  It'll be drone.
[00:27:48.387 --> 00:27:52.849]  The use of unmanned weapons platforms would enable the application of lethal force without human intervention.
[00:27:53.129 --> 00:27:54.630]  That means the elite can do it.
[00:27:55.555 --> 00:28:00.539]  Without having their soldiers, without having their fighter pilots, their tank drivers saying no.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:11.669]  You just have a bunch of remote controlled weapons platforms land and disgorge thousands of robot combat mechs.
[00:28:11.929 --> 00:28:13.010]  That's already here by the way.
[00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:20.116]  Application of lethal force without human intervention, raising consequential legal and ethical issues is what we're always talking about.
[00:28:20.396 --> 00:28:21.637]  Are we always talking about that?
[00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:27.712]  This is what we're into here, ladies and gentlemen, and I don't need to read some government report to see all this.
[00:28:28.392 --> 00:28:35.716]  The explicit use of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons and devices delivered by unmanned vehicles or missiles.
[00:28:36.277 --> 00:28:37.297]  Like 9-11, you mean.
[00:28:37.957 --> 00:28:46.362]  Which, again, you can have criminals inside the government launch the attacks and the government itself is unaware because it's shadowed and bootlegged through a drill.
[00:28:47.343 --> 00:28:47.983]  Technology.
[00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:55.675]  By 2035, an implantable information chip could be wired directly into the brain, a growing pervasiveness of information
[00:28:56.641 --> 00:29:11.593]  Communications technology will enable states, terrorists, or criminals to mobilize flash mobs, challenging security forces to match the potential agility, coupled with an ability to concentrate forces quickly in a small area.
[00:29:12.113 --> 00:29:13.534]  And then they go into the middle class.
[00:29:13.574 --> 00:29:19.319]  It next says the middle class is going to be mad because there will be no middle class, and so they're going to be Marxist.
[00:29:21.656 --> 00:29:30.419]  Because the government's going to bring that back out, folks, and try to suck up all the rebellion, and they're going to popularize it, rage against the machine, all that.
[00:29:30.459 --> 00:29:31.519]  It's going to be disgusting.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.801]  And if they win, it'll just be like George Orwell who went and served them, Eric Blair, and many others.
[00:29:36.981 --> 00:29:41.463]  They will find out if they survive the young commies that it's totally evil.
[00:29:43.284 --> 00:29:45.324]  And of course, it'll all be banker-controlled, as usual.
[00:29:45.785 --> 00:29:47.825]  See, they're even ready to seize control of the revolution.
[00:29:48.205 --> 00:29:49.906]  That's why I don't want this thing to turn violent.
[00:29:51.562 --> 00:29:54.583]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.483 --> 00:29:58.264]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:02.145 --> 00:31:04.866]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[00:31:05.246 --> 00:31:08.246]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.

[00:31:38.227 --> 00:31:41.409]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:48.491]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:32:06.353 --> 00:32:11.054]  But most of us are only taking one source of calcium supplementation and one source of magnesium.
[00:32:11.214 --> 00:32:19.716]  That just simply isn't enough to give your body the proper nutrition it needs to help keep bones and teeth strong, prevent osteoporosis, and support muscle function.

[00:33:19.946 --> 00:33:23.429]  Welcome back!
[00:33:44.139 --> 00:34:00.033]  Well, I started getting phone calls this morning.
[00:34:00.073 --> 00:34:00.674]  Did you hear it?
[00:34:00.714 --> 00:34:01.775]  It was on the local radio.
[00:34:01.795 --> 00:34:02.395]  Did you see it?
[00:34:02.436 --> 00:34:04.417]  It was on the front page of the Statesman.
[00:34:05.078 --> 00:34:07.220]  They're going to turn Mopac into a toll road!
[00:34:09.329 --> 00:34:11.431]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got the TxDOT maps.
[00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:12.012]  They're going to turn 360.
[00:34:12.092 --> 00:34:15.135]  They're going to turn Congress.
[00:34:15.155 --> 00:34:18.578]  They're going to turn... And if you're listening all over the country, this matters.
[00:34:18.598 --> 00:34:19.579]  This is coming to your city.
[00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:20.600]  This is coming to your town.
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:24.063]  I mean, I've got it in every major state, every major city.
[00:34:24.804 --> 00:34:34.553]  Foreign companies, for some reason I can't find American companies, come in, buy off the politicians, and are given the roads, and then just get to keep part of the money.
[00:34:35.658 --> 00:34:43.700]  Just like for a lot less than what it's worth, but it's part of the global strategy, Dow Chemicals being sold to the Saudis this week.
[00:34:44.661 --> 00:34:45.621]  $50 billion deal.
[00:34:47.141 --> 00:34:48.162]  All of this is happening.
[00:34:49.502 --> 00:34:52.063]  I mean, who just moved to Dubai?
[00:34:52.143 --> 00:34:52.703]  Halliburton.
[00:34:53.523 --> 00:34:55.204]  Well, there shouldn't be any bids.
[00:34:55.224 --> 00:34:56.304]  They're an American company.
[00:34:56.324 --> 00:34:57.144]  No bid contracts.
[00:34:57.164 --> 00:34:57.765]  Well, they're gone.
[00:34:58.225 --> 00:34:58.825]  Don't you worry.
[00:35:00.085 --> 00:35:02.106]  So, this is the whole
[00:35:04.404 --> 00:35:10.109]  We're going to talk to Sal for about 10 minutes, and I'm going to get back into this revolution, flash mobs, and brain chips.
[00:35:10.509 --> 00:35:12.571]  A grim vision of the future, but a London Guardian.
[00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:13.452]  Very, very important.
[00:35:14.954 --> 00:35:20.279]  Sal Costello is with the Texas Toll Party, and he's been leading the fight against this.
[00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:45.099]  Spin the whole story about how it's needed for Texas and it's wonderful and it'll help us and TexDOT, the Texas Department of Transportation, just can't help it and this is what they've got to do and you know darn it, it just has to happen.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:52.742]  But when you read deeper, you learn they're just going to take the shoulder and add new
[00:35:53.974 --> 00:35:55.956]  And then turn it into a toll road.
[00:35:56.256 --> 00:36:01.281]  That's how they get around the state and federal laws that you can't have it on existing roads.
[00:36:01.321 --> 00:36:10.269]  They just add a lane, or two new lanes, or fix a bridge, and then it's a toll road, but then there's a lane for buses.
[00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:12.651]  And this is how they're going to fix the traffic.
[00:36:12.871 --> 00:36:14.333]  Because they don't have the money!
[00:36:14.924 --> 00:36:36.774]  Well, two years ago, right around Christmas, the documents got released from AngryTex.HighLevelEmployees, and the memos stated that they had giant surpluses, what at the time was over six billion dollars, and that gas taxes had gone way up, and people were using a lot more gas, a lot more gasoline than they were in the past, and they had a lot of money.
[00:36:36.855 --> 00:36:38.435]  And they were saying, why are we telling them this?
[00:36:38.495 --> 00:36:42.057]  Why are we giving everything to Spain, and to Australia, and to Germany?
[00:36:42.077 --> 00:36:43.938]  Alright, I'm going to shut up and go to Sal Costello.
[00:36:45.008 --> 00:36:46.669]  Sal, thank you for coming on.
[00:36:46.989 --> 00:36:50.850]  I mean, we told everybody they were planning this, and then they tried to go, okay, well, we're not going to do that now.
[00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:52.650]  They were never planning to stop, Sal.
[00:36:53.071 --> 00:36:53.771]  Well, hey, Alex.
[00:36:53.851 --> 00:36:54.931]  It's good to talk with you again.
[00:36:55.531 --> 00:36:58.532]  Yeah, you know, they're changing their tune.
[00:36:58.552 --> 00:37:04.494]  See, here's the kicker, and folks all across the country, this is a red flag.
[00:37:04.514 --> 00:37:14.057]  When you hear the word managed lanes, this is the marketing term they use that doesn't have the nasty toll word, because everybody knows tolls are tax.
[00:37:14.761 --> 00:37:17.923]  But when they say managed lanes, most people don't know what the heck that is.
[00:37:17.963 --> 00:37:21.346]  It doesn't sound like a toll, it doesn't sound like a tax, but it is.
[00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:29.572]  It's just a fancy word for toll roads, but here on Mopac, I've got to tell you, there are a few major problems.
[00:37:29.892 --> 00:37:41.080]  Number one is, my question is, when they narrow these lanes from 12 feet to 11 feet to shoehorn another lane or two in there, how many more people are going to die a year?
[00:37:42.361 --> 00:37:43.602]  They've got the numbers, they know.
[00:37:44.642 --> 00:37:45.643]  That's the first question.
[00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:58.414]  Then the next problem is TxDOT is going to use $110 million of our tax dollars to create these toll roads, these managed lane toll roads, which are going to tax us again.
[00:37:59.895 --> 00:38:00.776]  Isn't that double tax?
[00:38:02.477 --> 00:38:02.937]  Would you say?
[00:38:03.558 --> 00:38:04.359]  And here's another one.
[00:38:04.679 --> 00:38:12.005]  The managed lanes create more gridlock as folks are going to try to drive over to cross
[00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:15.952]  Over three lanes to enter into the managed lane and then exit.
[00:38:16.293 --> 00:38:21.275]  When they exit they have to cross over three lanes to get out of Mopac.
[00:38:21.875 --> 00:38:24.476]  So these managed lanes always create
[00:38:25.054 --> 00:38:26.774]  More traffic problems.
[00:38:26.915 --> 00:38:30.656]  You look at the folks that have 91 there in California.
[00:38:30.696 --> 00:38:31.616]  That thing is a massive mess.
[00:38:31.816 --> 00:38:34.357]  Can you imagine themselves trying to build?
[00:38:34.697 --> 00:38:36.897]  Because they've got two different plans.
[00:38:36.917 --> 00:38:43.699]  We'll either create another lane on the shoulder, or we'll build a big double-decker above it and then wall off all the exits.
[00:38:44.119 --> 00:38:46.620]  Because this goes through the rolling hills of Austin, folks.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.720]  This has Zilker Park.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.181]  This is through the wealthy areas of the city.
[00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.651]  This is through the middle class areas in the city.
[00:38:54.091 --> 00:38:55.451]  This is the main artery.
[00:38:55.831 --> 00:39:01.533]  I mean, even at peak traffic time, it might take you to go from one end of Austin to the other, maybe 40 minutes.
[00:39:01.933 --> 00:39:03.274]  That is not that bad.
[00:39:03.654 --> 00:39:09.736]  I can go from one end of Austin to the other in like 10, 12 minutes when, you know, 90% of the time.
[00:39:10.256 --> 00:39:12.877]  And, I mean, this, MOPAC was working wonderfully.
[00:39:13.197 --> 00:39:14.497]  They're building up other roads.
[00:39:14.537 --> 00:39:16.378]  They need to build other bypasses.
[00:39:16.418 --> 00:39:17.058]  They need to build
[00:39:17.851 --> 00:39:19.212]  But no, no, no, no.
[00:39:19.732 --> 00:39:23.234]  But the point here is, let's say they wanted to expand Mopac.
[00:39:23.314 --> 00:39:27.917]  I'd say, go ahead, knock yourselves out, but you better do it in a way where it doesn't block the existing lanes.
[00:39:29.618 --> 00:39:35.502]  The lie is, they don't have money, so they've got to have a toll company take the existing road!
[00:39:35.962 --> 00:39:45.508]  Yeah, and it's existing right of way, and they're going to use $110 million to convert, or to shoehorn these new lanes in there.
[00:39:46.115 --> 00:39:47.456]  And how many people are going to die?
[00:39:47.556 --> 00:39:49.116]  And how much is this costing?
[00:39:49.137 --> 00:39:54.319]  And if they're going to shoehorn this in, I think the question is, lay it on the line.
[00:39:54.359 --> 00:39:56.680]  Tell us how many more people are going to die.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.643]  And then take our tax money and let us decide if we want to do it.
[00:40:02.163 --> 00:40:04.544]  And then if you decide to do it, don't be tolling it.
[00:40:05.197 --> 00:40:06.637]  In tagging it.
[00:40:06.677 --> 00:40:10.899]  But they already took the north of Mopac and did that.
[00:40:10.979 --> 00:40:14.720]  And I told everybody, look, Sal, they're going to do the south by our, you know, where we live.
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:15.600]  You live, you're my neighbor.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.000]  They're going to take the middle.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.441]  They're taking the middle right now.
[00:40:18.461 --> 00:40:19.761]  This is like 80% of it.
[00:40:20.181 --> 00:40:26.663]  And when you go in and complain, they'll say, even though it's in the paper, they will say, there's no toll road.
[00:40:26.883 --> 00:40:27.863]  This is not a toll road.
[00:40:27.944 --> 00:40:29.124]  It just charges you money.
[00:40:30.184 --> 00:40:32.246]  Yeah, they're really funny.
[00:40:32.506 --> 00:40:38.191]  And by the way, have you tried to go up a North Mopac where the toll roads are and try not to pay?
[00:40:38.211 --> 00:40:40.913]  I mean, man, it sends you to another planet.
[00:40:40.973 --> 00:40:47.578]  You literally can't go anywhere because it diverts you in these different areas and sends you to different places.
[00:40:47.958 --> 00:40:54.744]  And I'm good, I'm really good at directions and driving, but I literally, it was like a bowl of spaghetti up there.
[00:40:54.764 --> 00:40:56.225]  You really can't get anywhere.
[00:40:56.889 --> 00:40:57.790]  If you don't pay that toll.
[00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:01.535]  Yeah, for those that don't know, they just came in on every major nexus point.
[00:41:01.876 --> 00:41:05.640]  A couple of years ago when those TxDOT maps came out, Sal, I remember showing them on TV.
[00:41:06.061 --> 00:41:10.547]  It's every major choke point, there's no way to get around these toll roads.
[00:41:10.707 --> 00:41:13.791]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:41:13.831 --> 00:41:15.053]  Here's the problem, when you have a
[00:41:15.633 --> 00:41:22.417]  The Department of Transportation of our state, like we have, their focus has always been on getting, moving people.
[00:41:22.758 --> 00:41:23.038]  Okay?
[00:41:23.078 --> 00:41:26.720]  And yeah, they did a horrible job of it for decades, but here's the problem.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:34.665]  Now they're getting into the revenue generation business, and it's even going to be worse because they're just concerned about collecting money.
[00:41:35.546 --> 00:41:36.926]  That's all they really care about.
[00:41:36.966 --> 00:41:40.288]  But let's be clear, I mean... They quit trying to fix traffic.
[00:41:40.469 --> 00:41:42.610]  Now they're just going to try to collect as much money as they can.
[00:41:43.254 --> 00:41:47.518]  Well, we're going into the looting process of the United States, looting at every angle.
[00:41:47.918 --> 00:41:53.703]  Tell folks about, they mentioned they're spraying a couple public meetings on people.
[00:41:54.163 --> 00:41:55.504]  Oh yeah, don't you like this?
[00:41:55.564 --> 00:41:59.367]  I mean, by law they're supposed to give 30 day notice or something like that, and what is this?
[00:41:59.467 --> 00:42:00.528]  Just a few day notice?
[00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:09.316]  And people, I mean it's going to take people a couple weeks to even figure out, you know, to talk with their neighbors and say, hey by the way, did you know that this is going on?
[00:42:09.836 --> 00:42:12.138]  But yeah, we've got a few days to get there.
[00:42:13.318 --> 00:42:14.699]  It's crazy.
[00:42:14.779 --> 00:42:15.539]  It's insulting.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.541]  It's very upsetting.
[00:42:20.721 --> 00:42:30.406]  Most people drive to get places, and even folks that don't are affected by all of this because goods and services will cost more to get around.
[00:42:31.206 --> 00:42:32.827]  And it always comes back to our pockets.
[00:42:32.847 --> 00:42:39.610]  So not only are you paying the toll, but you're paying to get those goods and services around as they got your choke points, like you had mentioned.
[00:42:40.539 --> 00:42:46.101]  But yeah, they've been pushing it here, and we've been fighting it for, what, three years now, our group.
[00:42:47.622 --> 00:42:57.485]  And every time you beat one down, you beat down a plan, then they pop up some new little schemes, and they start calling it something else, like Manage Lanes.
[00:42:59.065 --> 00:43:08.591]  Sal Costello, fire out the websites, because you don't just cover Texas, you're looking at the national picture as our infrastructure is handed over to private interest.
[00:43:08.651 --> 00:43:10.592]  Fire out your websites for people who want to learn more.
[00:43:10.932 --> 00:43:20.518]  Yes, everybody can go to texastollparty.com and folks that live within Central Texas or in Austin, they can go to austintollparty.com.
[00:43:20.858 --> 00:43:25.781]  Like the Boston Tea Party, we've got austintollparty.com and texastollparty.com.
[00:43:27.449 --> 00:43:34.391]  Boy, I tell you, for the average person trying to commute to work, they're talking about $2 to $4 just to go down that leg of Mopac.
[00:43:34.831 --> 00:43:46.593]  Can you imagine, on top of all your gasoline costs and everything, paying upwards of $8 a day just to travel one leg of a toll road that was existing road?
[00:43:46.773 --> 00:43:47.073]  Yeah.
[00:43:47.533 --> 00:43:47.774]  Yeah.
[00:43:48.054 --> 00:43:51.974]  And the kicker is, they make the promises that it's going to help you, okay?
[00:43:52.195 --> 00:43:53.975]  But they've been promising this for decades.
[00:43:54.736 --> 00:43:59.902]  And by the way, 91 that I mentioned, Highway 91 in California, I just saw an article that just came out.
[00:44:00.403 --> 00:44:02.365]  It's a dollar a mile.
[00:44:03.426 --> 00:44:04.628]  A dollar a mile.
[00:44:04.948 --> 00:44:09.374]  And if you see pictures or video of Highway 91, it is a nightmare.
[00:44:09.454 --> 00:44:11.677]  People there are always complaining.
[00:44:11.737 --> 00:44:13.319]  They're writing into the paper all the time.
[00:44:13.914 --> 00:44:16.356]  And the toll booths aren't going to go away.
[00:44:16.637 --> 00:44:21.481]  But the government just ignores them and they've got their new illegal alien block taking over California.
[00:44:21.521 --> 00:44:24.784]  They'll vote for anything the government tells them, like total gun control.
[00:44:25.625 --> 00:44:28.788]  Now about to pass total gun bans in LA and that's all going to happen here.
[00:44:29.088 --> 00:44:32.611]  Folks, you want bondage, you want enslavement, you're now going to get it.
[00:44:32.931 --> 00:44:34.493]  And I want to make it clear here on the record.
[00:44:34.773 --> 00:44:36.154]  These are existing roads.
[00:44:36.434 --> 00:44:40.955]  They are seizing the entire infrastructure of the state at strategic choke points.
[00:44:41.235 --> 00:44:44.036]  They're going to make tens of billions of dollars a year.
[00:44:44.356 --> 00:44:47.117]  And you've done the analysis, Sal, even the papers have.
[00:44:47.337 --> 00:44:58.241]  By the way, this toll company just bought up all these Texas newspapers, what, 50-something of them, of hundreds they bought nationwide, all along strategic routes, papers that were criticizing them.
[00:44:58.501 --> 00:45:01.462]  Now there's glowing articles about how wonderful it is.
[00:45:01.763 --> 00:45:02.923]  The Statesman article says,
[00:45:03.183 --> 00:45:08.065]  They're caught between a rock and a hard place, they have to put toll roads on it, they don't have the money!
[00:45:08.325 --> 00:45:10.646]  That is a total and complete lie!
[00:45:10.666 --> 00:45:12.267]  It's just incredible!
[00:45:12.587 --> 00:45:21.991]  Yeah, and you've got folks like Rick Perry, they keep raking in the money from these folks and then they sell off our infrastructure for 50 years!
[00:45:23.709 --> 00:45:28.453]  Rick Perry's family will be benefiting from the money that they're pulling in.
[00:45:28.493 --> 00:45:29.274]  And let's be clear.
[00:45:29.374 --> 00:45:30.795]  We paid to build the roads.
[00:45:30.855 --> 00:45:31.996]  These are existing roads.
[00:45:32.356 --> 00:45:35.619]  Anytime the state builds a new road, they know we're going to hand it over.
[00:45:35.839 --> 00:45:41.844]  And then when the legislature wanted to know, TxDOT said it was a secret agreement with Cintra of Spain.
[00:45:42.445 --> 00:45:42.705]  Yeah.
[00:45:43.125 --> 00:45:46.608]  And TxDOT lied directly to the legislature.
[00:45:46.988 --> 00:45:48.870]  I was there at a meeting just some weeks ago.
[00:45:49.574 --> 00:46:04.396]  When Senators had text out Armahatsi and they said, hey, there's a non-compete agreement in with these roads where we can't fix or build new roads anywhere near your toll road.
[00:46:04.676 --> 00:46:06.058]  Oh no, no, there's no non-compete.
[00:46:06.687 --> 00:46:07.307]  But there was!
[00:46:07.327 --> 00:46:14.651]  I mean, they just flat out lie because they're so close to getting this revenue stream.
[00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:18.093]  They're basically becoming a taxing authority.
[00:46:18.433 --> 00:46:26.717]  What's supposed to be a government transportation entity is creating its own little tax authority.
[00:46:26.897 --> 00:46:28.798]  Well, my wife got mad about this this morning.
[00:46:28.818 --> 00:46:30.179]  She goes, we've got to go to that meeting.
[00:46:30.439 --> 00:46:32.580]  And I'm like, baby, I'm busy doing films and lurking.
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:36.362]  Literally, I was here again last night till about midnight, which was an early evening.
[00:46:36.942 --> 00:46:39.343]  And I mean, I can't go down there.
[00:46:39.503 --> 00:46:41.944]  Everybody else needs to go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:42.425 --> 00:46:44.926]  And you need to let them know, hey, we know you're crooks.
[00:46:45.346 --> 00:46:46.406]  We know this is a scam.
[00:46:46.446 --> 00:46:49.387]  We know you're just here to make us think that you're listening to us.
[00:46:49.407 --> 00:46:50.727]  But we're going to do whatever it takes.
[00:46:51.167 --> 00:46:59.529]  If that means having P.I.s follow city council members and catch them with their boyfriends or girlfriends, I mean, it's time to start playing hard ball.
[00:46:59.969 --> 00:47:00.309]  Okay?
[00:47:00.529 --> 00:47:02.690]  These people are crooks, period.
[00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:03.630]  They're bought and paid for.
[00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:06.451]  They're a bunch of smiley-faced scum, and they're criminal.
[00:47:07.091 --> 00:47:10.191]  Sal Costello, I've got the article here in front of me, and I didn't underline it.
[00:47:10.551 --> 00:47:11.652]  When and where are the meetings?
[00:47:11.692 --> 00:47:12.732]  They just now announced this.
[00:47:13.853 --> 00:47:15.073]  Well, I don't have it in front of me.
[00:47:16.194 --> 00:47:17.415]  Let me look here in the article.
[00:47:17.515 --> 00:47:19.477]  I've got it somewhere here.
[00:47:19.917 --> 00:47:20.457]  Oh, here it is.
[00:47:21.118 --> 00:47:22.879]  It says, it just says we're going to have two meetings.
[00:47:23.159 --> 00:47:24.460]  Here it is.
[00:47:27.042 --> 00:47:27.863]  The meetings this week.
[00:47:27.923 --> 00:47:33.386]  It says the 10th of this month and the 12th of this month.
[00:47:33.426 --> 00:47:35.748]  The 10th is at the O. Henry Middle School.
[00:47:36.389 --> 00:47:38.210]  And you can find, I'm looking at the text dot
[00:47:39.511 --> 00:47:42.392]  Department of Transportation website.
[00:47:42.412 --> 00:47:45.534]  Well, they violate state law and do it a day before.
[00:47:45.634 --> 00:47:46.954]  It's announced a day before.
[00:47:46.974 --> 00:47:49.936]  It's supposed to be a month before.
[00:47:50.316 --> 00:47:50.556]  Yeah.
[00:47:50.756 --> 00:47:52.377]  Pretty soon they just won't even announce them.
[00:47:52.997 --> 00:47:54.517]  Well, they might.
[00:47:55.158 --> 00:47:57.119]  You know, what's the point, really?
[00:47:58.619 --> 00:48:01.120]  But yeah, you can check the TxDOT website.
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:06.182]  And I have a blog that if you go to awesomesoulparty.com, to the very left side you see News.
[00:48:06.222 --> 00:48:07.863]  You click there and you go right to my blog.
[00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:13.715]  And I'll have those dates on my blog, as well as much more detailed information.
[00:48:14.116 --> 00:48:25.166]  But I would urge people to go to these meetings and send in letters to the editor and the statesman, and maybe they'll get printed, and just say, hey, how many people are going to die from shoehorning these additional lanes in there?
[00:48:25.286 --> 00:48:27.729]  The point is, you don't put toll roads on Mopat.
[00:48:27.769 --> 00:48:28.550]  We already paid for it.
[00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:30.491]  Southern Fellow, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:48:30.692 --> 00:48:31.092]  Thank you.
[00:48:31.112 --> 00:48:32.914]  I appreciate you joining us.
[00:48:34.276 --> 00:48:35.076]  Unbelievable.
[00:48:35.456 --> 00:48:45.799]  It says the meetings this week will include presentations by the Transportation Department, displays of maps, cross-sectional drawings of the Mopac might look like, and mock-up photos showing the proposed road.
[00:48:47.959 --> 00:48:51.060]  And then it doesn't say where the meetings will be.
[00:48:52.821 --> 00:48:54.701]  This is so sick.
[00:48:56.101 --> 00:48:57.102]  This is so sick.
[00:48:58.022 --> 00:49:02.183]  Why don't you call the guy at the Statesman, Ben Weir,
[00:49:03.562 --> 00:49:10.587]  And ask Ben, hey, why don't you talk about how they're supposed to announce these meetings a month before state law?
[00:49:11.588 --> 00:49:16.972]  Why don't you talk about how the statesmen reported two years ago that text-out documents came out and they've got extra money and that they don't need more money?
[00:49:17.253 --> 00:49:22.036]  Why do you write this disgusting piece when literally 97% of Texans are against this?
[00:49:23.877 --> 00:49:24.378]  His number is 512-445-3698.
[00:49:24.398 --> 00:49:24.438]  512-445-3698.
[00:49:31.897 --> 00:49:38.182]  Why don't you call him and ask him where the meetings are going to be.
[00:49:41.325 --> 00:49:49.432]  The plan which will be unveiled at public meetings Tuesday and Thursday at two Central Austin schools eliminates no auxiliary lanes or other existing ramps.
[00:49:50.172 --> 00:49:54.376]  What it would require, however, is at least a tight stretch between Town Lake and
[00:49:55.832 --> 00:49:56.773]  RM-222.
[00:49:57.033 --> 00:49:58.954]  So that's the main stretch of Mopac.
[00:49:59.374 --> 00:50:00.875]  And they're going to take lanes away.
[00:50:00.935 --> 00:50:02.316]  A tight stretch!
[00:50:02.716 --> 00:50:04.037]  And then they've got toll roads right beside it.
[00:50:04.858 --> 00:50:08.700]  Is narrowing the six existing lanes from 12 feet to 11 feet.
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:09.621]  That's always lies.
[00:50:10.041 --> 00:50:12.002]  And making the shoulder several feet narrower.
[00:50:13.023 --> 00:50:14.363]  They're going to add toll roads down the middle.
[00:50:15.024 --> 00:50:22.789]  The proposed $110 million project, which would run 12 miles from Town Lake to Palmer Lane, includes sound walls will be 12 feet tall.
[00:50:24.551 --> 00:50:28.894]  Which would destroy the beautiful view of the hill country and the rivers and everything else.
[00:50:28.914 --> 00:50:30.976]  This is just unbelievable criminal activity.
[00:50:35.099 --> 00:50:41.204]  Alright, I'm going to get back and blitz through this story here.
[00:50:43.566 --> 00:50:45.627]  Revolution, flash mobs, brain chips.
[00:50:46.048 --> 00:50:48.850]  A grim vision of the future from the Ministry of Defense out of England.
[00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:50.831]  Then Jeff Rents joins us.
[00:50:51.632 --> 00:50:52.573]  PrisonPilot.com.
[00:51:04.585 --> 00:51:07.790]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:10.034]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:18.046]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:25.803]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.203 --> 00:51:37.648]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.948 --> 00:51:41.470]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:43.831]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.171 --> 00:51:48.013]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:01.169 --> 00:53:03.790]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:10.073]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[00:53:10.213 --> 00:53:19.356]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.
[00:53:19.596 --> 00:53:20.797]  It's called SlenderFX.

[00:54:38.344 --> 00:54:43.646]  We're going to be writing stories about it.
[00:54:43.666 --> 00:54:46.127]  We're going to be having guests on covering it.
[00:54:46.147 --> 00:54:55.150]  I'm going to spend a lot of time this week on this report because it's a long report and I'm trying to get the entire actual MOD report, Ministry of Defense report.
[00:54:56.550 --> 00:55:01.492]  You want to know what the world is going to look like, they're giving you a pretty good picture of it, but they're spinning the whole thing.
[00:55:04.306 --> 00:55:04.887]  Listen to this.
[00:55:05.167 --> 00:55:09.532]  By 2035, an implantable information ship could be wired directly into the brain.
[00:55:09.932 --> 00:55:16.839]  A growing pervasiveness of information communications technology will enable states, terrorists, or criminals to mobilize flash mobs.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.642]  But then it's the Department of Defense here that's pushing the brain chip.
[00:55:19.662 --> 00:55:21.324]  That's in a Department of Defense 2000 report.
[00:55:22.305 --> 00:55:29.469]  Challenging security forces to match the potential agility coupled with the ability to concentrate forces quickly in small areas.
[00:55:29.529 --> 00:55:34.372]  Again, this is a Department of Defense, Ministry of Defense report out of England of what they believe is going to happen.
[00:55:35.493 --> 00:55:35.933]  Now listen to this.
[00:55:36.073 --> 00:55:44.378]  They've already spun earlier that the mobs of the non-existent middle class are going to be upset by the consolidation of wealth, so they're going to be Marxist.
[00:55:45.997 --> 00:55:57.286]  No, the bankers used Marxism to consolidate wealth in scores of countries, and used socialism here to get us addicted to government, and then transfer the wealth into the corporations through corporate welfare.
[00:55:57.746 --> 00:56:03.151]  You see, the false left-right liberal-conservative paradigm is meant to confuse you about that fact.
[00:56:03.611 --> 00:56:07.774]  It's the corporations behind the environmental movement to steal land, not to actually help the environment.
[00:56:08.094 --> 00:56:08.795]  They're behind it all.
[00:56:10.116 --> 00:56:11.077]  That's why they're in charge.
[00:56:13.286 --> 00:56:20.951]  The middle classes could become a revolutionary class, taking the role envisioned for their proletariat by Marx.
[00:56:21.051 --> 00:56:23.193]  See, now they make any revolution communist.
[00:56:23.661 --> 00:56:24.561]  See how they staged that?
[00:56:24.621 --> 00:56:26.002]  August the Founding Fathers were communists too.
[00:56:26.462 --> 00:56:27.082]  Says the report.
[00:56:27.542 --> 00:56:31.683]  The thesis is based on a growing gap between the middle class and the super-rich.
[00:56:31.904 --> 00:56:34.004]  That's a nice way of saying the disappearing middle class.
[00:56:34.544 --> 00:56:43.127]  The thesis is based on a growing gap between the middle class and the super-rich, on one hand, and an urban upper class threatening social order.
[00:56:44.753 --> 00:56:52.018]  So, but again, the general poor masses who take their middle class are going to be told the middle class is the rich.
[00:56:52.278 --> 00:57:02.904]  So the elite will sic the working class on whatever's left of the middle class, and they'll run around vitriolically, you know, burning cities, whatever, and... Oh my God.
[00:57:02.924 --> 00:57:06.547]  Don't worry, the government will seize their assets for you.
[00:57:06.567 --> 00:57:08.648]  Oh, because they're so good.
[00:57:09.398 --> 00:57:18.609]  The world's middle classes might unite using access to knowledge, resources and skills to shape transnational processes in their own class interest.
[00:57:18.689 --> 00:57:20.010]  Now see, that's true!
[00:57:20.971 --> 00:57:24.075]  We are going to rise, but see, they frame it though it'll be Marxist.
[00:57:24.964 --> 00:57:28.485]  Marxism can also be revived, it says, because of global inequity.
[00:57:28.905 --> 00:57:40.829]  An increasing trend towards moral relativism and pragmatic values will encourage people to seek the sanctuary provided by moral, rigid belief systems, including religious orthodoxy.
[00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:47.931]  Yeah, as the world gets more and more evil, a lot of people are going to grow up and stop caring about trinkets and looks and baubles and get down to earth.
[00:57:48.711 --> 00:57:49.372]  And they know that.
[00:57:49.412 --> 00:57:50.392]  People are going to get serious.
[00:57:50.812 --> 00:57:53.893]  Including religious orthodoxy and doctrine.
[00:57:56.346 --> 00:57:59.707]  of political ideology such as popularism and Marxism.
[00:57:59.727 --> 00:58:02.968]  They keep saying Marxism, Marxism, Marxism, Marxism, Marxism.
[00:58:03.668 --> 00:58:09.289]  See, no more populist movement, no more freedom, no more founding fathers, no more liberty, no more anti-corruption.
[00:58:09.749 --> 00:58:11.730]  They're going to frame it as it's Marxism.
[00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:12.650]  That's how you rebel.
[00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:17.531]  Pressures leading to social unrest by 2010, and it goes on.
[00:58:18.311 --> 00:58:24.473]  Population and resources, the Middle East, Islamic militancy, Iran, terrorism, climate change,
[00:58:25.504 --> 00:58:27.085]  We're going to get to this before the show ends today.
[00:58:27.125 --> 00:58:29.346]  I'm going to cover more of it, but this is so important.
[00:58:30.686 --> 00:58:36.809]  And what they don't tell you here is that it's the globalists accentuating and pushing all the major crises.
[00:58:37.089 --> 00:58:37.789]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.431 --> 00:58:46.013]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.953 --> 00:58:58.574]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.254 --> 00:59:00.294]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.014 --> 00:59:02.135]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.775 --> 00:59:03.595]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.355 --> 00:59:05.235]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.255 --> 00:59:09.777]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.097 --> 00:59:14.218]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:34.835 --> 00:59:36.856]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[00:59:36.896 --> 00:59:38.996]  I just ran out of the studio to conduct some business.
[00:59:39.156 --> 00:59:40.317]  Where were we able to get our guest?
[00:59:43.118 --> 00:59:43.898]  Fantastic.
[00:59:43.938 --> 00:59:45.539]  We've got Jeff Rents on with us.
[00:59:47.256 --> 00:59:50.557]  For the full hour, I wanted to get him to cover colony collapse disorder.
[00:59:51.117 --> 00:59:55.199]  I wanted him to give us his take on Morgellons that he's been pioneering the research on.
[00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:01.201]  And also how that dovetails into a host of other issues with the environment.
[01:00:03.382 --> 01:00:04.802]  Namely, nanotech.
[01:00:04.882 --> 01:00:08.944]  What the government admits is going on with nanotech.
[01:00:10.015 --> 01:00:26.761]  I covered a story out of the London Guardian in the last hour, revolution, flash mobs and brain chips, a grim vision of the future, and this is what the Ministry of Defense officially believes and is predicting will happen in the world within 30 years.
[01:00:26.881 --> 01:00:32.203]  And many of the predictions come some as early as the next five years, the next four years actually.
[01:00:33.335 --> 01:00:34.976]  So, we'll be going over that.
[01:00:35.336 --> 01:00:37.096]  Also, there's been so many other big developments.
[01:00:37.697 --> 01:00:45.599]  Obviously, now, E. Howard Hunt, it turns out, before he died, wrote up page after page of handwritten notes to his son, St.
[01:00:45.639 --> 01:00:49.400]  James, about how he was the commander of the shooters.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:50.661]  We already knew that.
[01:00:50.701 --> 01:00:56.262]  He was photographed, one of the tramps, along with other known CIA officers, dead, perfect photos of them.
[01:00:59.233 --> 01:00:59.753]  Get on.
[01:01:00.394 --> 01:01:01.414]  And so that's come out.
[01:01:01.514 --> 01:01:03.416]  Cover of Rolling Stone of all places.
[01:01:04.356 --> 01:01:05.457]  Jeff Rents joins us.
[01:01:05.477 --> 01:01:07.038]  He has his own syndicated radio show.
[01:01:07.058 --> 01:01:10.260]  He's been on for over 12 years on Talk Radio.
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:14.302]  And he hosts the show 9 to Midnight Central right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:01:14.342 --> 01:01:15.123]  I'm a routine guest.
[01:01:15.543 --> 01:01:18.905]  Jeff never does interviews except on this show and I'm always honored when he joins us.
[01:01:18.945 --> 01:01:23.007]  But I twisted his arm to come on because he really is the expert on Morgellons.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.160]  I'm ignorant of this.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.401]  I'm trying to discover.
[01:01:27.481 --> 01:01:29.783]  I mean, obviously there's something going on.
[01:01:29.803 --> 01:01:32.365]  Obviously there are things in the environment.
[01:01:32.925 --> 01:01:35.547]  Every person who's claiming this stuff is not schizophrenic.
[01:01:36.127 --> 01:01:37.989]  Are you going to have schizophrenics that think it's happening?
[01:01:38.369 --> 01:01:39.570]  Yes, and I've run into some of them.
[01:01:40.526 --> 01:01:45.589]  Uh... because you know, then they start saying, I know you're involved with it, or I know, you know, stuff like that.
[01:01:45.689 --> 01:01:48.210]  But there are weird things going on with the human body.
[01:01:48.411 --> 01:01:49.811]  The honeybees are all dying.
[01:01:49.951 --> 01:01:52.873]  Over 70% dead in Texas, over 60% in the U.S.
[01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:56.455]  Major reports, German university studies,
[01:01:57.055 --> 01:02:06.677]  Have now conclusively shown that one type of BTG, Monsanto corn, strips their intestine walls and allows bacteria to kill them.
[01:02:07.237 --> 01:02:10.758]  And so the media is saying, we don't know why, we don't know why, maybe it's GMO.
[01:02:11.058 --> 01:02:11.618]  No, we know.
[01:02:11.658 --> 01:02:13.218]  So there's a lot of weird stuff going on.
[01:02:13.458 --> 01:02:14.418]  And we have to look at it.
[01:02:14.438 --> 01:02:16.059]  And Jeff's found some amazing evidence.
[01:02:16.119 --> 01:02:18.939]  And a lot of medical doctors are now saying there's something real here.
[01:02:19.239 --> 01:02:20.199]  Jeff, thanks for coming on.
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:21.560]  Sure, Alex.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:22.640]  It's good to be here.
[01:02:23.761 --> 01:02:27.205]  Fortunately, my arm is in a sling, but I can still talk fine.
[01:02:27.585 --> 01:02:28.226]  I didn't know!
[01:02:28.967 --> 01:02:29.588]  You got hurt!
[01:02:29.948 --> 01:02:31.010]  Well, you twisted my arm.
[01:02:32.391 --> 01:02:33.232]  You got me, man.
[01:02:33.993 --> 01:02:34.554]  You got me.
[01:02:34.594 --> 01:02:35.275]  Oh my gosh.
[01:02:36.293 --> 01:02:37.014]  Oh my gosh.
[01:02:37.074 --> 01:02:40.035]  Well, if anybody is going to twist my arm, it might as well be you.
[01:02:41.116 --> 01:02:50.040]  Jeff, we've only got about a minute before we break, but out of the gates, I want to start just with the basics of what the government and scientists admit about nanotech.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.641]  And for those that don't know, tell them what nanotech is.
[01:02:52.921 --> 01:02:56.983]  It's a building of small molecular machines from the atom up.
[01:02:57.043 --> 01:02:58.404]  They build them one atom at a time.
[01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:00.946]  And the potential is literally limitless.
[01:03:01.546 --> 01:03:04.227]  It is so infinite, it's scary.
[01:03:04.787 --> 01:03:06.708]  And that brings into play all kinds of things.
[01:03:06.728 --> 01:03:08.009]  You've heard of the mad scientist.
[01:03:08.049 --> 01:03:08.649]  We all have.
[01:03:09.389 --> 01:03:15.072]  And it takes literally one lunatic with nanotechnology at his or her hands in a laboratory.
[01:03:15.112 --> 01:03:19.814]  And let's say that person has a bad day and has a grudge against people or somebody or whatever.
[01:03:20.394 --> 01:03:33.140]  One of the easiest things to make with nanotechnology is a very small molecular machine, which has as its sole function the destruction of every living cell, biological cell it comes into contact with, and it is self-replicating.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.661]  So that could be the end, the end of everything.
[01:03:35.681 --> 01:03:37.222]  I mean, that's how easy it is, folks.
[01:03:37.342 --> 01:03:37.943]  That's where we are.
[01:03:38.443 --> 01:03:39.583]  Jeff Rentsch, stay there.
[01:03:39.663 --> 01:03:40.844]  Honored to have you with us.
[01:03:40.864 --> 01:03:47.027]  We're going to come back and get into colony collapse disorder, the pet food, nanotech,
[01:03:47.722 --> 01:03:53.163]  How does it all tie together with our friend Jeff Rentsch, right here on the GCN Network.
[01:03:56.644 --> 01:04:02.146]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:10.128]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.859 --> 01:04:17.923]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.303 --> 01:04:29.709]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.029 --> 01:04:33.952]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.992 --> 01:04:35.953]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:40.115]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.965 --> 01:05:56.386]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:05:56.886 --> 01:06:00.208]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:06:00.568 --> 01:06:03.510]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:10.173]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:06:10.253 --> 01:06:14.655]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:06:14.895 --> 01:06:19.258]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:06:19.418 --> 01:06:22.020]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.802]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:06:25.282 --> 01:06:27.804]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:06:27.864 --> 01:06:32.107]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:06:32.167 --> 01:06:33.008]  Treasury bonds.
[01:06:33.288 --> 01:06:37.912]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[01:06:38.092 --> 01:06:42.896]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:43.156 --> 01:06:51.543]  That's 1-888-8-XANADU, or 1-888-8-X-A-N-A-D-U, and ask for George.
[01:06:53.445 --> 01:06:58.489]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.849 --> 01:07:01.131]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:18.555 --> 01:07:21.998]  We're now eight minutes into the second hour today.
[01:07:22.078 --> 01:07:23.599]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:25.741]  It is the ninth day of April 2007.
[01:07:25.781 --> 01:07:27.402]  Jeff Rents of Rents.com
[01:07:30.317 --> 01:07:41.341]  One of the leaders, if not the leader in alternative media, and he's been huge for many, many years, reached hundreds of millions conservatively, Jeff Rentsch, is our guest.
[01:07:41.841 --> 01:07:51.364]  And I just wanted to set the table with this, with the San Francisco Chronicle article I saw a few years ago that we've pulled back up from time to time and covered here on air, and a report
[01:07:52.125 --> 01:08:00.266]  Was an Air Force General talking about antimatter bombs that they'd built, but that they didn't want to test them because it might destroy the entire solar system.
[01:08:00.286 --> 01:08:00.927]  They didn't know.
[01:08:02.307 --> 01:08:09.408]  I've also seen reports where top scientists at superconducting super colliders don't want to accelerate certain types of particles, but they're ordered to.
[01:08:09.488 --> 01:08:14.989]  Some of them quit because they reported that the mathematics show it could cause some type of chain reaction.
[01:08:15.009 --> 01:08:17.789]  I mean, you think the A-bomb, the hydrogen bomb are big.
[01:08:18.029 --> 01:08:18.130]  It's 2007.
[01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:18.870]  Those are tinker toys.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.021]  I think so.
[01:08:38.995 --> 01:08:42.176]  Combinations when just one could give rise to a super virus.
[01:08:42.476 --> 01:08:53.560]  That was in the mainstream news last week where splicing humans with pigs did give rise to very serious viruses because most animal viruses and bacteria we aren't affected by because there's a buffer.
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:54.140]  They're different.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:09:00.302]  Those bacteria and viruses are specialized to each host organism or to each life form, each species.
[01:09:00.842 --> 01:09:01.362]  Not now!
[01:09:02.023 --> 01:09:04.524]  And again there's a pell-mell just doing it.
[01:09:04.944 --> 01:09:05.664]  Proteogen
[01:09:06.978 --> 01:09:10.361]  In 97 locations, just type protein gene in.
[01:09:10.961 --> 01:09:13.343]  Pharmacological, live AIDS virus in the corn.
[01:09:13.643 --> 01:09:15.925]  They had guys in spacesuits out burning down fields.
[01:09:15.965 --> 01:09:17.046]  Honeybees carried it out.
[01:09:17.567 --> 01:09:22.090]  I have German University reports, zoological reports, insect reports, U.S.
[01:09:22.150 --> 01:09:28.115]  reports, CDC reports, showing in studies that they would eat the Bt corn from Monsanto.
[01:09:28.155 --> 01:09:29.496]  This is just one of hundreds of types.
[01:09:29.976 --> 01:09:31.177]  That it would go into their stomachs.
[01:09:31.918 --> 01:09:33.459]  I covered this yesterday on the Sunday Show.
[01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:34.860]  It would go into their stomachs.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:35.961]  They would eat it.
[01:09:36.716 --> 01:09:40.497]  And then it would strip out their intestinal wall to where then they were open.
[01:09:40.517 --> 01:09:41.957]  It was like giving them AIDS, basically.
[01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:44.878]  To where any bacteria would basically kill them.
[01:09:45.538 --> 01:09:51.360]  So, and then the twist as well, Monsanto says, it's not our corn killing them, it just does that to their stomach.
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.041]  And it's not our fault that it causes bacteria to be able to do that.
[01:09:55.061 --> 01:09:59.422]  So I'm going to shut up about it and bring in Jeff Rents because if all that's scary, and that's admitted,
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:01.661]  What's going on with Morgellons?
[01:10:01.841 --> 01:10:12.926]  And now we've got doctors, medical centers saying, yeah, we are pulling out weird plastic fibers, basically, out of people's skin, and it's clear they couldn't have put it there, because the skin has been undisturbed.
[01:10:13.206 --> 01:10:14.307]  Jeff Renz, thanks for coming on.
[01:10:14.727 --> 01:10:15.487]  Yeah, you're welcome.
[01:10:15.848 --> 01:10:16.628]  You mentioned the Atty.
[01:10:16.748 --> 01:10:21.110]  Manor bomb, and I didn't know if it would stop, and the universe might be destroyed.
[01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:26.953]  Well, the same concerns, of course, confronted the Manhattan scientists in the 1940s with the first atomic bomb.
[01:10:29.005 --> 01:10:30.506]  But it didn't stop them from lighting it off.
[01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:36.087]  Seems that mankind will do whatever mankind does and with no restraint.
[01:10:36.167 --> 01:10:37.468]  If they can go there, they'll go there.
[01:10:37.508 --> 01:10:45.270]  With scant concern for any ramifications that might be derogatory to the lifestyle we are used to living.
[01:10:45.731 --> 01:10:47.751]  It's also the lust and the race for power.
[01:10:47.791 --> 01:10:50.872]  They say, well, if I don't create the antimatter bomb, they will!
[01:10:51.052 --> 01:10:51.793]  It's all defense.
[01:10:52.093 --> 01:10:54.374]  We have to do it first for our own defense or they will.
[01:10:54.434 --> 01:10:56.274]  It's total crap, of course.
[01:10:56.894 --> 01:10:57.375]  It's a joke.
[01:10:57.615 --> 01:10:58.595]  Nanotechnology.
[01:10:59.224 --> 01:11:10.430]  With electron microscopy, background dispersion, x-ray technology now, through private grants, now this isn't our fake CDC doing this.
[01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:19.375]  The most that they've done, and we think we pressured them to do it, was appoint a task force, whatever the hell that means, to go out and explore and investigate Morgellons.
[01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:28.040]  What we do know from our own work, and I didn't do this, but the people I work with did, and again they've got the best in technology, they found out that these little fibers
[01:11:28.775 --> 01:11:51.732]  In more gallons patients are clearly nanotechnology either intentionally or accidentally turn loose in our society in our species and as you mentioned about species barrier usually protecting us from cross-transmission of viruses and bacteria nanotech doesn't care a whit about that it goes wherever it wants any living organism could be a plant could be an animal doesn't matter
[01:11:51.732 --> 01:11:56.614]  Well, let's go back though, because on your website, Rents.com, we've got a whole section I was reading a few weeks ago in horror.
[01:11:57.034 --> 01:12:04.818]  Mainstream reports, government reports, scientific bodies, saying, here are the dangers of nanotech, and then, lo and behold, that's exactly what's going on.
[01:12:05.258 --> 01:12:05.458]  Right.
[01:12:05.498 --> 01:12:11.401]  Well, there have been a few recent news reports about scientists now expressing concern about this new field.
[01:12:11.441 --> 01:12:12.341]  Should we slow down?
[01:12:12.381 --> 01:12:14.822]  Should we have a regulatory body and so forth?
[01:12:14.842 --> 01:12:16.303]  And, of course, it's not going to happen.
[01:12:16.643 --> 01:12:21.205]  There are countless thousands of people working in countless areas of nanotech.
[01:12:21.825 --> 01:12:23.006]  It's all being pushed forward.
[01:12:23.026 --> 01:12:23.986]  You talked about bees.
[01:12:24.046 --> 01:12:27.627]  Very fascinating because it certainly could be a GM issue.
[01:12:28.227 --> 01:12:29.508]  No question, Alex, about it.
[01:12:29.868 --> 01:12:41.632]  But we also are getting reports now, and we have bees going off to the lab now for examination, that the common fly, at least one fly, was found to have its brain, or what it passes for a brain.
[01:12:42.396 --> 01:12:42.917]  I don't know.
[01:13:01.571 --> 01:13:02.152]  We're good to go!
[01:13:14.918 --> 01:13:21.424]  Definition of Morgellons that I've assembled with some help from Shoshana Allison and a couple of others.
[01:13:21.945 --> 01:13:24.607]  And I put this together and I think it tells the story.
[01:13:24.647 --> 01:13:25.888]  Now let me read this.
[01:13:26.008 --> 01:13:29.391]  It's something that some of you have probably never heard before.
[01:13:29.431 --> 01:13:33.916]  It's one long paragraph, but it'll tell you what we know now as of April 2007.
[01:13:34.036 --> 01:13:34.436]  Morgellons.
[01:13:37.674 --> 01:13:42.398]  You can call it a disease, by the way, an affliction, an infestation, a syndrome, whatever you want.
[01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:43.459]  That's a parasite.
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:46.502]  But it's not a parasite in an animal form.
[01:13:48.043 --> 01:14:04.518]  A communicable nanotechnology invasion of human tissues in the form of self-assembling, self-replicating nanotubes, nanowires, nanoarrays with sensors and other nanoconfigurations.
[01:14:05.198 --> 01:14:09.902]  Some carrying genetically altered and spliced DNA and RNA.
[01:14:10.622 --> 01:14:20.470]  These nanomachines thrive in alkaline pH conditions and use the body's own bioelectric energy and other unidentified elements for power.
[01:14:21.031 --> 01:14:25.214]  There is some evidence these tiny machines possess their own internal batteries.
[01:14:25.714 --> 01:14:33.140]  They are also believed to be able to receive specific tuned microwave EMF and ELF signals and information.
[01:14:33.922 --> 01:14:35.523]  To what end is not known.
[01:14:36.264 --> 01:14:41.067]  The symptoms vary from open skin lesions from which colored or plain fibers emerge.
[01:14:41.147 --> 01:14:43.428]  There are five or six different colors of these fibers.
[01:14:43.928 --> 01:14:46.590]  These lesions do not scab over normally.
[01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:48.731]  You won't get a brown firm scab on them.
[01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:53.775]  They heal extremely slowly and never become bacterially infected.
[01:14:54.095 --> 01:14:54.975]  Now think about that.
[01:14:55.316 --> 01:14:57.477]  They never become infected.
[01:14:58.146 --> 01:15:05.634]  The suggestion is something in these nanotech machines is harmful to bacteria and prevents these lesions from becoming infected.
[01:15:06.355 --> 01:15:13.603]  The symptoms also include brain fog, forgetfulness, short-term memory loss, fatigue, depression, and so forth.
[01:15:14.104 --> 01:15:19.530]  It is also established that Morgellons nanomachines are commonly found in all body fluids.
[01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:28.055]  Orifices and often even hair follicles and are believed to routinely achieve total body systemic penetration.
[01:15:29.076 --> 01:15:37.562]  It is reported by nearly all afflicted that Morgellons nanomachines seem to have some kind of hive or group intelligence.
[01:15:38.923 --> 01:15:48.549]  Communicability appears to be possible probable through shedding of the fibers by the infected and through all normal bacterial or viral
[01:15:49.267 --> 01:15:49.747]  vectors.
[01:15:50.307 --> 01:16:04.372]  Some fibers have been shown to withstand temperatures in excess of 1400 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning routine sterilization for Morgellons nanomachines in all reusable medical and dental medical equivalent instruments is now moot.
[01:16:05.113 --> 01:16:17.477]  There is also strong evidence linking chemtrail aerosol fibers to Morgellons fibers, although proof of transmission through aerial spraying remains anecdotal at this time.
[01:16:19.867 --> 01:16:37.021]  Now, Jeff, I want to approach this... I'm going to just say that I don't know what's going on with Morgellons, but I've seen the TV reports on the news where it showed different medical institutions with medical doctors going, we didn't believe it, but we really did pull out some type of weird plastic fiber and it doesn't look like they could have put it in their skin.
[01:16:37.481 --> 01:16:42.846]  But at the same time, obviously, there are people out there who are paranoid and have mental problems who are going to then think they have this.
[01:16:43.186 --> 01:16:43.466]  I think so.
[01:17:02.173 --> 01:17:14.953]  We know that there's been studies for decades of nanotech as a weapon platform because all you have to do is get a particle of nanotech that was designed to self-replicate out of normal body tissues and it would just start replicating until...
[01:17:15.956 --> 01:17:18.118]  It literally just ate up large sections of the body.
[01:17:18.418 --> 01:17:25.162]  So we know these technologies exist, you know, the question is, I mean, is that what this Morgellons is?
[01:17:25.242 --> 01:17:31.266]  And you've done a lot of research and posted a lot of, I mean, at first they were saying there was nothing to it, but now there have been these medical reports.
[01:17:31.466 --> 01:17:32.787]  Do you have those in front of you?
[01:17:32.807 --> 01:17:41.913]  Because I've seen them over the last year and the last few months, you know, all those different medical institutions and several different laboratories that did look at it and did say that they found something?
[01:17:42.253 --> 01:17:51.837]  Well, the biggest one so far is the Mayo Clinic, of course, and the Mayo Clinic has put out a formal paper on Morgellons, which is very good to read.
[01:17:51.857 --> 01:17:53.438]  We've got that up at the site as well.
[01:17:54.279 --> 01:17:56.660]  I don't know what to tell you about
[01:17:58.277 --> 01:18:02.041]  What the actual knowledge of the scientific community is at this point.
[01:18:02.422 --> 01:18:11.511]  I did speak to a dermatologist personally a couple weeks ago and asked this nice young woman, you know, well qualified, nice degrees and so forth.
[01:18:12.332 --> 01:18:14.194]  Do you have Morgellons patients?
[01:18:14.234 --> 01:18:15.376]  Do you see Morgellons?
[01:18:16.116 --> 01:18:19.320]  Oh yeah, we get them in here, but they're just skin pickers.
[01:18:20.788 --> 01:18:23.070]  And I said, have you done any research online?
[01:18:23.791 --> 01:18:24.732]  Oh, I've seen some of that.
[01:18:24.932 --> 01:18:29.396]  These people are primarily just fixated on their skin and they start picking and they can't stop.
[01:18:29.776 --> 01:18:30.737]  She didn't want to hear about it.
[01:18:31.378 --> 01:18:34.401]  That's the majority of the dermatological community right now.
[01:18:34.461 --> 01:18:35.301]  That's how they think.
[01:18:35.702 --> 01:18:36.282]  They don't know.
[01:18:36.923 --> 01:18:38.144]  Some are threatened by it, of course.
[01:18:38.164 --> 01:18:41.187]  But the Mayo Clinic said that... We'll read that when we come back.
[01:18:41.207 --> 01:18:41.327]  Yeah.
[01:18:42.896 --> 01:18:45.941]  I mean, you've got major medical institutions saying something's going on.
[01:18:46.081 --> 01:18:50.067]  We're not saying there aren't nuts out there who then think this is what they have.
[01:18:50.607 --> 01:18:52.991]  There's nuts who think that their heart is impeding.
[01:18:54.055 --> 01:18:57.616]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:18:57.676 --> 01:18:58.157]  are located?
[01:18:58.377 --> 01:19:01.758]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:19:01.978 --> 01:19:06.679]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:13.902]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas, brewing environmental catastrophes,
[01:19:14.162 --> 01:19:18.268]  The safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.
[01:19:18.528 --> 01:19:31.245]  Complete with three gigabytes of detailed information on each of 3,000 plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis to help you
[01:19:31.405 --> 01:19:31.825]  I think so.
[01:19:59.104 --> 01:20:01.186]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[01:20:01.666 --> 01:20:02.386]  One and the same.
[01:20:03.107 --> 01:20:04.428]  If you have deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[01:20:07.463 --> 01:20:12.906]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:13.346 --> 01:20:16.468]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:20:16.728 --> 01:20:18.569]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:21.651]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:20:22.192 --> 01:20:24.413]  Here is reality.
[01:20:24.773 --> 01:20:28.355]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:20:28.855 --> 01:20:32.517]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:35.919]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[01:20:37.256 --> 01:20:40.977]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[01:20:43.298 --> 01:20:48.739]  Thus says Yahweh, if you will not keep my commandments by violating my covenant, I will bring upon you sudden terror.
[01:21:03.832 --> 01:21:06.993]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[01:21:07.233 --> 01:21:10.914]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[01:21:11.194 --> 01:21:19.136]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.

[01:21:47.317 --> 01:21:51.322]  Unless she repents, America will not survive the Red Horse of World War III.
[01:21:53.237 --> 01:21:57.740]  Summer is once again just around the corner, and as usual, so are higher gas prices.
[01:21:58.181 --> 01:22:01.343]  This year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back.
[01:22:01.823 --> 01:22:09.889]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:17.395]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised, Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem, unburned fuel.
[01:22:17.855 --> 01:22:21.558]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[01:22:22.038 --> 01:22:26.862]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[01:22:27.282 --> 01:22:33.907]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[01:22:34.508 --> 01:22:36.109]  And it's so easy to use!
[01:22:36.569 --> 01:22:42.474]  Simply pour a couple of ounces into your tank at every fill-up and you're on your way to saving money and the environment.
[01:22:42.934 --> 01:22:49.319]  So, do yourself and the environment a favor and visit ctsavegas.com to get your bottle today.
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:51.721]  That's ctsavegas.com.
[01:23:11.044 --> 01:23:12.885]  There really are hydrogen bombs.
[01:23:13.746 --> 01:23:18.549]  They really have admitted that they've been working on antimatter weapons.
[01:23:20.231 --> 01:23:21.351]  They have particle beams.
[01:23:23.293 --> 01:23:27.896]  They have nerve gas that the smallest micron will kill you dead as a doornail.
[01:23:29.798 --> 01:23:32.780]  They have supercomputers that can beat any human at chess.
[01:23:34.081 --> 01:23:37.263]  Our military is going over to fleets of drone aircraft.
[01:23:38.095 --> 01:23:44.118]  We know that going back 30, 40 years, they had developed the term nanotech and had huge government secret projects on it.
[01:23:45.578 --> 01:23:46.579]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:23:47.099 --> 01:23:51.061]  And I have to be honest, a year ago, two years ago, when I first heard about this, I thought, oh, that's just nuts.
[01:23:52.081 --> 01:24:04.567]  And then I started looking at the Mayo Clinic and other medical reports and, you know, on TV, them doing surgeries where there was no place where they put the fibers in themselves and there are these fibers.
[01:24:05.467 --> 01:24:07.448]  And then you got the honeybees dying.
[01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:11.991]  I mean, they dump in the ocean to eat oil slicks, genetically engineered bacteria.
[01:24:12.412 --> 01:24:13.852]  Having no idea what that will do.
[01:24:14.193 --> 01:24:15.153]  The point is, we don't know.
[01:24:15.213 --> 01:24:16.094]  We have to investigate.
[01:24:16.756 --> 01:24:18.996]  And Jeff Renz has done more investigation than anybody I know.
[01:24:19.417 --> 01:24:21.857]  Talk show host right here on Genesis, the website for Renz.com.
[01:24:22.217 --> 01:24:25.038]  Jeff, continuing, what did the Mayo Clinic say?
[01:24:25.078 --> 01:24:30.839]  Again, you've got news clips, video clips, documents up on Renz.com, but just boil it down for us.
[01:24:31.039 --> 01:24:38.360]  Well, we have, for anybody really interested in researching this, put together a tremendous database, and you'll see the primary and featured stories.
[01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:41.001]  But at the bottom of that box, it says More.
[01:24:41.061 --> 01:24:45.542]  When you click on More, you'll see dozens of scores and scores of photographs and articles.
[01:24:45.922 --> 01:24:54.378]  This is a silicone, silica-based, some kind of a high-density polyethylene fiber, but it doesn't just take that configuration.
[01:24:54.839 --> 01:24:55.981]  There is more to it.
[01:24:56.673 --> 01:25:00.036]  It produces other things, which we'll talk about in a few minutes.
[01:25:00.656 --> 01:25:06.961]  The Mayo Clinic finally put forth a paper on this on April 9th, which is actually more courageous.
[01:25:08.042 --> 01:25:10.744]  It wasn't April 9th, it was earlier than that, but they've updated it, I can see.
[01:25:11.404 --> 01:25:18.870]  This is more courageous than the CDC has done or any other of the professional AMA organizations, which so far are standing off from this at great distance.
[01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:22.952]  I suggest the CDC at the highest levels already knows what this is about.
[01:25:23.332 --> 01:25:24.453]  But they're doing what they always do.
[01:25:24.473 --> 01:25:25.993]  Just like they do with mad cow disease.
[01:25:26.413 --> 01:25:28.094]  We have two cases officially here.
[01:25:28.154 --> 01:25:28.835]  Forget about it.
[01:25:28.875 --> 01:25:30.275]  We've got cases all over the place.
[01:25:30.916 --> 01:25:34.797]  But here's what the CDC hasn't done that the Mayo Clinic has.
[01:25:34.877 --> 01:25:35.858]  Here's the Mayo Clinic.
[01:25:36.405 --> 01:25:37.326]  More Gallons Disease?
[01:25:37.406 --> 01:25:39.147]  Managing a Mysterious Skin Condition?
[01:25:39.187 --> 01:25:41.589]  More Gallons Disease is Controversial.
[01:25:41.629 --> 01:25:44.071]  Here you'll find answers to common questions and so forth.
[01:25:44.552 --> 01:25:45.472]  And they go on from there.
[01:25:45.552 --> 01:25:50.596]  If you suspect that you have more gallons, and a lot of you thinking out there right now, probably, maybe I do.
[01:25:50.696 --> 01:25:52.478]  Gee, I got these weird stuff in my skin.
[01:25:52.538 --> 01:25:55.440]  Well, the skin is the biggest organ of the body, of course.
[01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:57.382]  It's quite a sophisticated and vital
[01:25:57.982 --> 01:26:02.005]  Oregon and it does have many things from HPV to psoriasis.
[01:26:02.365 --> 01:26:02.785]  What was it?
[01:26:03.365 --> 01:26:07.388]  Most young British boys now the majority have psoriasis.
[01:26:07.628 --> 01:26:08.268]  Think about that.
[01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:09.749]  I wonder what they really do have.
[01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:14.352]  By the way, a majority also are British boys are too fat for military service.
[01:26:15.112 --> 01:26:17.434]  We don't have the only obesity epidemic in the world here.
[01:26:18.566 --> 01:26:22.630]  Sixteen countries now have reported Morgellons disease.
[01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:25.472]  That's the reported acknowledged cases.
[01:26:25.952 --> 01:26:28.915]  But what are the signs and symptoms according to the Mayo Clinic now?
[01:26:29.616 --> 01:26:31.817]  Skin lesions accompanied by intense itching.
[01:26:32.478 --> 01:26:33.399]  Not always the case.
[01:26:33.439 --> 01:26:35.040]  I'm going to throw in parenthetically here.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.422]  Itching is not always necessarily there.
[01:26:37.502 --> 01:26:41.765]  Sometimes pain, sometimes discomfort, and sometimes all three.
[01:26:42.706 --> 01:26:45.829]  Number two, crawling sensations on or under the skin.
[01:26:46.718 --> 01:26:49.500]  Often compared to insects moving, stinging, or biting.
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.701]  This is maybe the creepiest part for some people.
[01:26:52.302 --> 01:26:56.444]  Number three, fatigue significant enough to interfere with daily activities.
[01:26:57.205 --> 01:27:01.548]  Number four, inability to concentrate in difficulty with short-term memory.
[01:27:02.108 --> 01:27:03.929]  And then there are behavioral changes.
[01:27:04.009 --> 01:27:14.396]  And those have been described to me by people who have had Morgellons for seven or eight years as being a tendency for negative personality traits to intensify.
[01:27:15.973 --> 01:27:16.913]  Not to leave it with that.
[01:27:17.534 --> 01:27:24.036]  Fibers which can be white, blue, green, red or black in and on the lesions and under the lesions.
[01:27:24.777 --> 01:27:35.882]  These signs and symptoms said the Mayo Clinic might appear along with changes in vision, stomach pain or other gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in skin texture and pigmentation as well.
[01:27:36.282 --> 01:27:41.804]  Morgellons disease shares characteristics with various recognized conditions including ADD,
[01:27:44.205 --> 01:27:49.090]  Chronic Fatigue, Lyme, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.
[01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:52.974]  That's getting fixated on something and I'm unable to back off or let it go.
[01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:54.275]  And a lot of people have that now.
[01:27:54.816 --> 01:27:59.200]  And a mental illness involving false beliefs about infestation by parasites.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:03.624]  Now this is what a lot of dermatologists of course have dished off to Morgellons sufferers.
[01:28:04.945 --> 01:28:06.307]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:06.327 --> 01:28:06.607]  I want him!
[01:28:27.596 --> 01:28:34.300]  I should have gotten more of this together before the show, but I've seen all these news pieces and they've got doctors and it shows them, you know, we're moving them.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.961]  I want to talk about some of those video clips I've seen up on your site.
[01:28:37.221 --> 01:28:37.821]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.884 --> 01:28:44.825]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.845 --> 01:28:46.886]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.786 --> 01:28:50.468]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:54.903]  Attention gardeners!
[01:28:54.964 --> 01:28:57.327]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:28:57.567 --> 01:29:01.913]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:29:02.114 --> 01:29:09.985]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:29:10.285 --> 01:29:13.127]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:29:13.408 --> 01:29:20.953]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:29:21.054 --> 01:29:26.638]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:29:26.858 --> 01:29:32.421]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:36.003]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:29:36.243 --> 01:29:39.604]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:29:39.844 --> 01:29:44.887]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt-cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:29:44.907 --> 01:29:47.768]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:47.828 --> 01:29:48.008]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:29:54.002 --> 01:30:00.017]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:30:00.037 --> 01:30:02.142]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for
[01:30:07.639 --> 01:30:08.059]  We're good.
[01:30:32.585 --> 01:30:32.905]  I think so.
[01:30:54.042 --> 01:30:54.923]  It's no secret.
[01:30:55.203 --> 01:31:00.667]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[01:31:00.847 --> 01:31:05.610]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:08.252]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[01:31:08.452 --> 01:31:11.033]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called Novo.
[01:31:11.294 --> 01:31:19.459]  Novo eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration, which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[01:31:19.619 --> 01:31:23.822]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in Novo.
[01:31:24.162 --> 01:31:30.364]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and geranium.
[01:31:30.544 --> 01:31:34.705]  No-BO's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin.
[01:31:34.865 --> 01:31:39.246]  You can use No-BO under your arms, on tough foot odors, or for athlete's foot.
[01:31:39.386 --> 01:31:43.367]  No-BO is guaranteed 100% or receive a full refund.
[01:31:43.707 --> 01:31:46.247]  Visit No-BO.com to order.
[01:31:46.368 --> 01:31:49.188]  That's No-BO.com or call 850-723-8599.
[01:31:58.681 --> 01:32:00.586]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:01.087 --> 01:32:03.814]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:30.524 --> 01:32:37.506]  The problem is, so many real calamities have taken place that have been kept quiet.
[01:32:38.346 --> 01:32:44.967]  So many incredibly dangerous things have transpired that we're just now learning of that... Who knows what is true?
[01:32:45.347 --> 01:32:49.848]  Jeff Rents, what convinced you of Morgellons being real?
[01:32:49.908 --> 01:32:53.409]  I mean, again, I've read all these medical reports and seen doctors and...
[01:32:54.361 --> 01:32:59.557]  You know, Oklahoma Medical Center, and they're pulling them out, saying, yeah, there's something there, we don't know what it is.
[01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:01.985]  What convinced you of this being real?
[01:33:03.655 --> 01:33:13.041]  I think the scientific research by Dr. Hildegard Stanninger, other MDs, and researchers pushed me as a journalist to accept reality.
[01:33:13.101 --> 01:33:28.592]  I read the reports, I saw the data, but much like with chemtrails, Alex, years ago people were telling me, in 1996, about the time you started seeing them too, when they began in earnest that these things are being sprayed, and I said, ah, come on, those are just persistent contrails.
[01:33:29.227 --> 01:33:35.873]  Until one day I was lying, taking an afternoon siesta, in Santa Barbara, my hometown, looking up at the beautiful blue sky.
[01:33:36.094 --> 01:33:37.875]  Nothing in the sky, not a cloud anywhere.
[01:33:37.995 --> 01:33:39.377]  Gorgeous, about 2 in the afternoon.
[01:33:40.057 --> 01:33:43.520]  And a big jet flew over, I don't know, 10,000 feet, not very high.
[01:33:44.201 --> 01:33:44.842]  And behind it,
[01:33:45.698 --> 01:33:50.801]  Two incredibly huge plumes, and I got up and looked, and I said, what is that?
[01:33:50.821 --> 01:33:51.862]  It looked like cotton candy.
[01:33:52.282 --> 01:33:58.045]  And it went from horizon all the way to the other end of the horizon, and then one, another, another, and I watched this thing.
[01:33:58.085 --> 01:33:59.366]  I waited for it to dissipate.
[01:33:59.406 --> 01:34:00.266]  It didn't dissipate.
[01:34:00.686 --> 01:34:08.311]  It just got raked out by the prevailing west to east winds, turned into a high-looking cloud, and then overcast, and anyway, the rest was history.
[01:34:08.351 --> 01:34:08.871]  I saw it.
[01:34:09.371 --> 01:34:10.192]  The same thing
[01:34:11.187 --> 01:34:12.069]  with more gallons.
[01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:20.085]  What locked it up for me was seeing it in someone's skin and actually pulling fibers out personally.
[01:34:20.791 --> 01:34:21.272]  I've done it.
[01:34:21.872 --> 01:34:22.473]  I've seen them.
[01:34:22.793 --> 01:34:26.757]  I've looked at them under microscopes of 50-60 power.
[01:34:27.958 --> 01:34:29.279]  I've seen colored fibers.
[01:34:29.519 --> 01:34:35.905]  I've seen these little roundish looking objects that appear to be the body's fat.
[01:34:35.945 --> 01:34:37.026]  And that's the latest wisdom.
[01:34:37.046 --> 01:34:45.414]  The body's fat somehow is either being used by these things or the body is trying to encapsulate some of the fibers by pushing fat deposits around it.
[01:34:45.854 --> 01:34:50.275]  These fat deposits also are accompanied by very small items under magnification.
[01:34:50.315 --> 01:34:53.096]  You can see them microscopy only needs to be about 50 power.
[01:34:53.616 --> 01:35:01.179]  They look like crystals, little crystalline structures and often in the fat or in the crystals you'll see these fibers embedded within them.
[01:35:01.339 --> 01:35:06.040]  Some of the little crystalline structures which are irregular in shape but roundish in overall appearance
[01:35:06.658 --> 01:35:09.520]  Have black dots in them, like a little black eye.
[01:35:10.121 --> 01:35:18.467]  And the prevailing thoughts about those are that they may be the early stages of a fiber before it starts to grow.
[01:35:18.927 --> 01:35:21.609]  But again, these things don't just appear as fibers.
[01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:22.510]  There are other things as well.
[01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:25.853]  Well, this sounds like some kind of science fiction, you know, late night horror movie.
[01:35:25.873 --> 01:35:29.195]  Well, it's worse than that, because the people that get this disorder
[01:35:30.905 --> 01:35:31.986]  Don't know who to talk to.
[01:35:32.346 --> 01:35:34.068]  They have no one to talk to, most of them.
[01:35:34.428 --> 01:35:36.230]  Every state in the union has reported this now.
[01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:38.692]  And we think there may be millions of people carrying it.
[01:35:39.112 --> 01:35:42.635]  Maybe millions of people are not showing infestation, obviously yet.
[01:35:42.996 --> 01:35:44.217]  We do think it's systemic.
[01:35:44.297 --> 01:35:50.142]  I mean, the skin portion of it may just be the last stage of it when it finally works its way to the top and starts to push its way up.
[01:35:50.522 --> 01:35:51.083]  We don't know.
[01:35:51.483 --> 01:35:59.806]  But with all the other symptoms, the mental symptoms and the physical symptoms and in all body fluids and so forth, these are systemic.
[01:36:00.066 --> 01:36:01.487]  They don't just stay in the skin.
[01:36:01.587 --> 01:36:07.128]  They obviously in most patients, we can't say for sure all of them, but in most patients apparently go systemically.
[01:36:07.188 --> 01:36:11.410]  Now Jan Smith, who has had this for eight years, had a right knee replaced
[01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:13.312]  We've talked about this on the program.
[01:36:13.553 --> 01:36:15.435]  I've done seven specials on this now.
[01:36:16.236 --> 01:36:26.691]  Right knee was replaced, I guess, a couple years ago and the surgeon came to her afterwards and said, you know that your joint was bad, we replaced it, but your knee joint was full of these little fibers, little microscopic fibers.
[01:36:27.351 --> 01:36:29.073]  And she knew she had something.
[01:36:29.173 --> 01:36:30.735]  She knew she had more gallons then.
[01:36:31.096 --> 01:36:32.177]  She didn't tell the doctors.
[01:36:32.197 --> 01:36:38.184]  Well, the next time she had the other knee replaced, they put her in total ISO and wore respirators when they did the surgery.
[01:36:38.224 --> 01:36:39.005]  And the same thing.
[01:36:39.025 --> 01:36:41.748]  The other knee was packed full of these little fibers.
[01:36:42.168 --> 01:36:45.709]  Then she had lower back surgery about, I guess, four or five months ago now.
[01:36:46.169 --> 01:36:47.590]  Maybe less.
[01:36:47.610 --> 01:36:57.733]  And the lumbar area and the incision healed very slowly, as is not always but commonly occurrent with Morgellons.
[01:36:58.113 --> 01:37:00.314]  And out of the incision came fibers.
[01:37:00.714 --> 01:37:01.395]  We're good to go!
[01:37:01.415 --> 01:37:02.035]  We're good to go!
[01:37:14.583 --> 01:37:17.405]  Absolute bleach was fascinating.
[01:37:18.105 --> 01:37:28.492]  Overnight these fibers literally crawled to the side of the glass beaker and up the side of the beaker and up the glass stir stick that was apparently left in the beaker.
[01:37:29.232 --> 01:37:30.713]  So they are motile.
[01:37:30.793 --> 01:37:35.156]  We have video at Rems.com showing these little fibers actually moving.
[01:37:36.116 --> 01:37:37.637]  Some of them actually move.
[01:37:38.077 --> 01:37:39.038]  They have a motility.
[01:37:40.475 --> 01:37:41.476]  We don't know what they're doing.
[01:37:41.736 --> 01:37:49.258]  Some of them look as if they have tiny hairs coming off them, radiating off their primary fiber, which look for all the world like a receiving antenna.
[01:37:50.359 --> 01:38:01.563]  We don't know that they have to look like an antenna to act like an antenna, but we do feel the potential is there for these to pick up some kind of EMF, ELF, or otherwise microwave-induced communications.
[01:38:02.424 --> 01:38:07.968]  We don't know what they're doing in the body, but the thought also is there may be several things going on in there.
[01:38:07.988 --> 01:38:11.811]  It may not be just one type of nanotechnology that's gotten loose.
[01:38:11.831 --> 01:38:12.892]  It could be two or three.
[01:38:13.032 --> 01:38:14.072]  We just don't know.
[01:38:14.293 --> 01:38:15.553]  Jeff, let me go back here for a minute.
[01:38:16.214 --> 01:38:18.856]  Are you saying you have video of them climbing out of the glass?
[01:38:18.896 --> 01:38:20.437]  Because that would convince me.
[01:38:20.857 --> 01:38:26.979]  I have video of them moving in a slide environment, not stained, just on a slide, held down.
[01:38:26.999 --> 01:38:33.962]  We just put that up about two weeks ago, and if you watch the fiber under video conditions, it will move.
[01:38:34.362 --> 01:38:34.842]  It moves.
[01:38:35.602 --> 01:38:36.122]  They move.
[01:38:37.063 --> 01:38:41.184]  And how do you know that's not some type of... Well, you have to trust who's doing the work.
[01:38:43.545 --> 01:38:44.706]  No, it's in a lab setting.
[01:38:44.726 --> 01:38:45.547]  There's no wind in the water.
[01:38:45.567 --> 01:38:49.709]  No, no, but I mean air-conditioning is... Moving your hand.
[01:38:49.749 --> 01:38:52.451]  I mean, I'm not... Jeff, I mean, I'm... You're asking good questions.
[01:38:52.471 --> 01:38:53.232]  These are good questions.
[01:38:53.292 --> 01:38:53.912]  It's a slide.
[01:38:54.192 --> 01:38:55.093]  It's a covered slide.
[01:38:55.893 --> 01:38:56.814]  And it's under video.
[01:38:58.275 --> 01:38:58.695]  They move.
[01:38:59.116 --> 01:39:02.678]  Well, I mean, I certainly know that... In fact, I've even seen it on CNN.
[01:39:02.758 --> 01:39:06.821]  One day, I was like on the exercise bike at the gym, and they had CNN on.
[01:39:06.861 --> 01:39:10.583]  That's one of the few times I watch TV, and I'll watch it for like an hour while I'm on an exercise bike.
[01:39:12.330 --> 01:39:14.232]  They had the closed caption and it showed doctors.
[01:39:14.252 --> 01:39:15.293]  I think it was in Oklahoma.
[01:39:15.313 --> 01:39:17.235]  They were medical doctors going, we didn't believe this.
[01:39:17.595 --> 01:39:20.978]  We're not saying what it is, but there's no way they put those fibers in themselves.
[01:39:20.998 --> 01:39:22.119]  This stuff's under the skin.
[01:39:22.139 --> 01:39:23.260]  That's right.
[01:39:24.041 --> 01:39:26.363]  Just from memory, do you know what report that was, Jeff?
[01:39:27.404 --> 01:39:29.286]  Because I was looking around your site and I couldn't find it.
[01:39:29.966 --> 01:39:31.648]  I mean that was probably six months ago.
[01:39:32.288 --> 01:39:43.257]  I've got a bunch but again you just look at the Morgellons feature story at the bottom it says more and there must be 40 or 50, 60 reports in there now.
[01:39:44.618 --> 01:39:45.900]  It's all there.
[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:49.903]  Now tell us about the particular doctor you just mentioned a few minutes ago who convinced you or
[01:39:50.903 --> 01:39:51.864]  Tell us about that person.
[01:39:52.265 --> 01:39:54.847]  Dr. Hildegard Staniger, PhD.
[01:39:54.867 --> 01:39:57.229]  She's an environmental toxicity expert.
[01:39:57.409 --> 01:39:59.831]  This is right up her professional alley.
[01:40:00.272 --> 01:40:08.719]  She's working with a number of other physicians and she's been on all the special programs, but trying to keep this from being exploited in the media.
[01:40:11.381 --> 01:40:16.102]  Trying to present this low-key but with solid science every step of the way.
[01:40:16.142 --> 01:40:25.065]  Too many people want to get these things and run wild with them and say, you know, the end of the world, it's science fiction here, it's going to wipe out all humanity and life forms on the planet.
[01:40:25.565 --> 01:40:28.506]  No, bird flu could do that easier and more quickly.
[01:40:28.946 --> 01:40:40.344]  But this is a whole new issue and we think it's the heritage of a lack of planning and a lack of an honest-to-God agenda in the beginning of evaluating nanotechnology and what the potential it has.
[01:40:40.364 --> 01:40:42.348]  Just like GM and crops, same thing.
[01:40:43.101 --> 01:40:48.742]  They're pushing for money, pushing for defense, pushing for our safety, so they're developing these nanomachines.
[01:40:48.982 --> 01:40:51.823]  And the potential of this, again, is limitless.
[01:40:52.383 --> 01:40:53.583]  Limitless, what they can do.
[01:40:53.603 --> 01:41:08.106]  Well, I'll tell you why, Jeff, that from the video clips I've seen, the reports I've read, I mean, I'm trying to investigate this, and I respect you, and so, I mean, I had a lot of credibility to it because of that, and you know a lot more than I do about this, so I'm, you know, pretty much reserving judgment, but something's going on.
[01:41:08.506 --> 01:41:12.587]  And if one example, one example of hundreds I could use, prote-gene,
[01:41:13.502 --> 01:41:32.818]  Based in Texas, in 97 locations, back in the, I guess 3 or 4 years ago, and it was in the Associated Press and in a few newspapers, but it still wasn't a big report, didn't break out in the national media, planted pharmacological corn that grows live HIV virus in them.
[01:41:34.035 --> 01:41:36.397]  And I told people about that on there, and they laughed at me.
[01:41:36.417 --> 01:41:37.838]  Then I'm like, no, no, this is admitted.
[01:41:37.878 --> 01:41:50.227]  And I even drove outside Austin, it's in between here and Crawford, and went and looked at one of the facilities where it had been grown at this research lab, open air, and they admitted that bees carried this stuff off.
[01:41:50.247 --> 01:41:51.428]  It's like an X-Files episode.
[01:41:51.468 --> 01:41:59.014]  So if they will, and again, that's one example of, I said hundreds, it's thousands of just open air tests they're doing at any one time.
[01:42:01.295 --> 01:42:19.148]  I told the story yesterday on the radio, on the Sunday show I do from 4 to 6 p.m., that I'm a couple years ago at a Conan's Pizza, getting a pizza to bring home to my wife, and this guy comes and pokes me in the back of the shoulder, and he says, hey man, you're a liar about spider goats.
[01:42:19.548 --> 01:42:20.388]  There's no such thing.
[01:42:20.989 --> 01:42:22.190]  You can't cross species.
[01:42:22.770 --> 01:42:24.651]  And I used to like you, but now I know you're a liar.
[01:42:24.671 --> 01:42:25.892]  And he was kind of lording over me.
[01:42:25.952 --> 01:42:26.853]  I said, listen, leave me alone.
[01:42:27.615 --> 01:42:28.416]  I said, fine.
[01:42:28.796 --> 01:42:30.838]  And he kept arguing, and I started getting rude.
[01:42:30.878 --> 01:42:31.459]  I said, listen.
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:35.122]  Because he was saying, you know, he took biology in college.
[01:42:35.943 --> 01:42:41.027]  And I said to him, I said, well, when were you in college?
[01:42:41.067 --> 01:42:41.247]  In the 70s?
[01:42:41.287 --> 01:42:42.328]  He goes, yeah.
[01:42:42.348 --> 01:42:44.711]  And I said, Mac, it's 2000 and something.
[01:42:44.771 --> 01:42:47.373]  It isn't the 1970s.
[01:42:47.413 --> 01:42:48.194]  Things have changed.
[01:42:48.234 --> 01:42:51.737]  And I said, why don't you just type in a search engine, spider goats.
[01:42:52.891 --> 01:42:57.075]  I mean, I've had the CEO of the company on, body armor comes out of their milk.
[01:42:58.597 --> 01:42:59.317]  Spiderweb.
[01:43:00.338 --> 01:43:02.260]  They got sheep that are 15% human.
[01:43:02.781 --> 01:43:04.122]  They got pigs that are 27% human.
[01:43:05.575 --> 01:43:07.836]  And that's, as you say, Jeff, what we know of.
[01:43:07.896 --> 01:43:10.237]  So, I mean, the sky's the limit now.
[01:43:10.317 --> 01:43:11.777]  Who knows what's going on?
[01:43:11.857 --> 01:43:12.878]  Now the door is open.
[01:43:13.438 --> 01:43:22.041]  And believe me, as Alex has said, experiments have been gone into in the past that probably would make our hair stand up on end.
[01:43:22.641 --> 01:43:27.883]  We don't know what they've done, but believe me, they have done probably everything you could think of and then some or have tried to.
[01:43:28.163 --> 01:43:28.903]  Here's an example.
[01:43:28.943 --> 01:43:40.126]  My dad is a dentist and also then became an oral surgeon and was doing a lot of implants in Dallas when I was, this is when I was like in junior high, and he was like, well, we may move to Maryland or we may move out here because I don't want to do government work.
[01:43:40.206 --> 01:43:45.228]  They're offering me a lot of money because they want to know how to graft technology and they need more people.
[01:43:45.268 --> 01:43:50.029]  They say it's a big operation, planting things into bone in cybernetics.
[01:43:50.809 --> 01:43:55.633]  I mean, folks, if they're trying to recruit my dad, the Dallas dentist, this must be big.
[01:43:55.653 --> 01:43:58.075]  And he said they were trying to recruit a bunch of other oral surgeons.
[01:43:58.375 --> 01:44:00.797]  I mean, they were trying to recruit hundreds of Dallas dentists, okay?
[01:44:01.698 --> 01:44:05.581]  And then, you know, boom, Dr. Deagle, medical doctor, they tried to recruit him for this.
[01:44:05.961 --> 01:44:12.807]  I mean, now every doctor, many doctors and people who have any expertise in grafting into bone, just on the cybernetics end.
[01:44:14.751 --> 01:44:15.051]  I know.
[01:44:15.071 --> 01:44:22.873]  Again, I just sit back sometimes and say, how much time is there left before somebody makes the big mistake?
[01:44:23.353 --> 01:44:25.414]  And we have a worldwide catastrophe.
[01:44:25.574 --> 01:44:27.895]  Well, this was a secret project they tried to recruit him into.
[01:44:28.235 --> 01:44:29.135]  Well, I understand.
[01:44:29.155 --> 01:44:31.956]  There are dozens of secret projects, maybe more.
[01:44:32.256 --> 01:44:32.596]  Hundreds.
[01:44:32.936 --> 01:44:35.297]  And they have how much money to conduct these secret projects?
[01:44:35.697 --> 01:44:36.657]  As much as they want.
[01:44:38.891 --> 01:44:40.552]  Yeah, the mixing of human genes.
[01:44:40.852 --> 01:44:48.915]  And for those of you who remember and have read Edward Cayce and his readings on Atlantis, whether or not you agree with the guy, it was pretty provocative stuff.
[01:44:48.955 --> 01:45:02.321]  In the 20s and 30s he was a very hardcore Christian fundamentalist and yet he'd be able to go into trances and literally pull a book off the shelf with anybody involved in his research and open it up and read all about that person.
[01:45:02.501 --> 01:45:05.562]  What their physical health was like, what could be done to make their health better.
[01:45:06.252 --> 01:45:07.436]  and about their past lives.
[01:45:07.536 --> 01:45:10.285]  I'm keeping this very short, but Casey did a lot of research
[01:45:11.433 --> 01:45:17.318]  In his Waking State, which discounted his Trans-State work, so you had a real conflict with the man.
[01:45:17.358 --> 01:45:25.725]  But the Trans-State work about Atlantis talked about the end times for them came when they began to mix human and animal.
[01:45:26.226 --> 01:45:29.508]  That was a hallmark of the last days of Atlantis.
[01:45:29.648 --> 01:45:30.989]  And we're doing that same thing now.
[01:45:31.150 --> 01:45:34.072]  We're playing God with things we should never have touched.
[01:45:34.472 --> 01:45:38.976]  And the open-air thing of growing HIV in corn is sheer insanity.
[01:45:39.651 --> 01:45:40.532]  Sheer insanity!
[01:45:41.212 --> 01:45:51.759]  And they've been doing it since the first GM crop trial when they promised all of us around the world in their press releases that, don't worry, we're going to do this in one acre or two acres and nothing will get loose.
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:52.760]  I laughed!
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:53.641]  I laughed at it then.
[01:45:53.681 --> 01:45:54.501]  You did too, Alex.
[01:45:54.521 --> 01:45:55.382]  You knew it was a lie.
[01:45:55.742 --> 01:45:57.943]  They can't control bees or insects or the wind.
[01:45:58.464 --> 01:46:01.626]  And look what they did to Percy Schmeiser in Canada with the canola.
[01:46:02.461 --> 01:46:06.466]  Blew into his fields, infected his crop with GM canola.
[01:46:07.207 --> 01:46:08.809]  Monsanto sued him and won.
[01:46:08.889 --> 01:46:09.490]  Wiped him out.
[01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:11.092]  Saying, you stole our patent.
[01:46:11.232 --> 01:46:12.634]  It's in your crop.
[01:46:13.194 --> 01:46:15.998]  He claims that they flew over and sprayed his crop.
[01:46:16.761 --> 01:46:18.962]  He's an older man, 78, 79 years old.
[01:46:19.022 --> 01:46:43.691]  Oh no, well they admitted that they flew over and dropped, this was in the National Geographic, that's how I learned about it, and dropped Roundup bombs just to kill a bunch of his plants, and they do this, this is admitted, now again that's trespassing, but it's okay for them to do it because they've got all the money, and then in the circle of where they dropped the Roundup, if one or two plants live, they know that means it has their genes,
[01:46:44.572 --> 01:47:04.374]  And sure enough, they hire former Royal Mounted Police and candidates, FBI here, I've interviewed families from Nebraska and places, who come on your land and grab your corn, grab your soybeans, grab your canola, and then they go analyze the plant, and if they find 1% Monsanto Terminator Gene or Roundup Ready or whatever, you're sued.
[01:47:05.237 --> 01:47:08.302]  And then they literally finance and run the court in St.
[01:47:08.342 --> 01:47:11.807]  Louis that hears all those cases where Monsanto is also based.
[01:47:12.408 --> 01:47:20.500]  And Monsanto's head, back in the late 90s, maybe it was 2000, said to the press, oh we're just going to infect everything and then you won't have a choice but to eat GMO.
[01:47:21.095 --> 01:47:23.578]  Well, that's what they're going to try and do with the organic industry, too.
[01:47:23.858 --> 01:47:30.987]  Last time I checked, what, 87% and there's hundreds of corn varieties are infected with one type of Monsanto corn.
[01:47:31.388 --> 01:47:32.209]  It's 87, wow.
[01:47:32.349 --> 01:47:37.195]  And that's the Bt corn, that's the one that they admit gets into the stomach of the bee, and then
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:47.244]  Understand, folks, they put a bacteria into the corn because then most insects will not then eat the corn, but the bee still eats it.
[01:47:47.504 --> 01:47:48.784]  So it has a pesticide.
[01:47:48.804 --> 01:47:51.545]  It says toxic to insects, but then we're eating it.
[01:47:52.306 --> 01:47:57.728]  And that pesticide, of course, can combine with the bacteria and create new creatures and so forth.
[01:47:57.788 --> 01:47:58.348]  It's amazing.
[01:47:58.468 --> 01:48:07.132]  Well, that's what it said, is that somehow it's allowing then all these other bacteria to get through the stomach wall, the intestinal wall of the bee.
[01:48:08.197 --> 01:48:12.280]  Well, we'll have to wait and see what the final decision on what's killing the bees is.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:13.941]  Maybe a couple or three things.
[01:48:14.901 --> 01:48:18.784]  Bees pollinate over 90 different fruits and vegetables that we eat.
[01:48:19.264 --> 01:48:24.427]  They pollinate 16 to 18 percent of all of the flowers and plants on the planet.
[01:48:25.048 --> 01:48:27.089]  So yeah, it's a catastrophe in the making.
[01:48:27.149 --> 01:48:28.950]  What's the loss of the hives in Texas again?
[01:48:28.970 --> 01:48:29.150]  70 percent?
[01:48:31.264 --> 01:48:32.266]  Yes, it's over 70%.
[01:48:32.786 --> 01:48:34.429]  Well, AP says 70%.
[01:48:34.729 --> 01:48:36.692]  German report says over 70%.
[01:48:37.473 --> 01:48:39.015]  It's pretty darn serious.
[01:48:39.055 --> 01:48:41.919]  And then areas of Europe are saying the entire US is over 60%.
[01:48:41.959 --> 01:48:42.019]  Wow.
[01:48:44.266 --> 01:48:47.048]  Well, I go back again to what the Mayo said, and I was so glad to see it.
[01:48:47.088 --> 01:48:49.229]  They're far in the lead of the CDC.
[01:48:49.589 --> 01:48:55.373]  And when they start talking about Morgellons symptoms, mimicking, ADD.
[01:48:55.533 --> 01:48:57.394]  When did ADD start?
[01:48:57.414 --> 01:48:58.355]  10, 15 years ago?
[01:48:58.635 --> 01:48:58.855]  Right?
[01:48:59.896 --> 01:49:03.498]  Other things that have been epidemic in the last 10 to 15 years.
[01:49:03.979 --> 01:49:08.281]  These things could be causing all kinds of trouble in people and not showing up on their skin.
[01:49:08.862 --> 01:49:09.842]  That's the bottom line.
[01:49:11.443 --> 01:49:12.064]  We just don't know.
[01:49:12.930 --> 01:49:30.540]  Well, regardless, we know that the phony environmental groups are out there just trying to snatch property, restrict development for larger financial institutions and get a global tax in the name of fighting man-made global warming when, even if you believe that, the tax will do nothing about it.
[01:49:30.901 --> 01:49:36.984]  Meanwhile, the military dumps nerve gas in the ocean, they do open-air testing of, you know, all these thousands of things.
[01:49:37.444 --> 01:49:39.866]  There's all sorts of allergies are just way up.
[01:49:40.724 --> 01:49:44.025]  And they use radioactive waste for fertilizer too now, isn't that clever?
[01:49:44.145 --> 01:49:50.506]  Oh yeah, and they're spraying a lot of the crops now with different types of fluoride as a pesticide, but it's okay for you to eat it.
[01:49:50.786 --> 01:49:51.407]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:56.628 --> 01:50:02.129]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.489 --> 01:50:10.111]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.842 --> 01:50:17.907]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.288 --> 01:50:29.696]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.036 --> 01:50:33.659]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.999 --> 01:50:35.921]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.261 --> 01:50:40.104]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:00.055 --> 01:51:04.159]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:51:04.459 --> 01:51:04.999]  We listened.
[01:51:05.299 --> 01:51:10.284]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:51:10.564 --> 01:51:11.044]  We listened.
[01:51:11.445 --> 01:51:14.467]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:51:14.907 --> 01:51:15.448]  We listened.
[01:51:15.908 --> 01:51:17.910]  You asked us to include an emergency light for
[01:51:17.930 --> 01:51:18.711]  We're good to go.

[01:51:56.425 --> 01:51:57.266]  Look no further!
[01:51:57.586 --> 01:52:00.149]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.

[01:52:26.849 --> 01:52:27.109]  I'm good.
[01:53:21.619 --> 01:53:26.743]  Well, Jeff, I appreciate you coming on with us today.
[01:53:27.744 --> 01:53:30.426]  In the closing minutes, we've got together.
[01:53:32.307 --> 01:53:36.650]  Tell us about some of the stuff you're going to be working on over at Rents.com the next days and weeks to come.
[01:53:37.611 --> 01:53:45.397]  Okay, but before we do that, let me suggest I've got the video you asked about and I can direct you where to find it.
[01:53:45.437 --> 01:53:50.741]  Look at the bottom of the More Gallons Features story box where it says More Data and go to that page
[01:53:51.997 --> 01:53:56.840]  Which says, Shocking Morgellons Fibers Video.
[01:53:57.060 --> 01:54:11.549]  And you'll see live videotape of these little, they're like fatty like yellow gristle things that people pull out of these lesions or that actually form what is not a scab but a callus over the lesion.
[01:54:11.710 --> 01:54:13.030]  They don't form normal scabs.
[01:54:13.050 --> 01:54:14.511]  You won't get a brown hard scab.
[01:54:14.551 --> 01:54:15.792]  You'll get kind of a callus-y thing.
[01:54:16.172 --> 01:54:17.213]  Which have these things.
[01:54:17.293 --> 01:54:18.494]  And you look at this video
[01:54:19.256 --> 01:54:22.098]  It's a shocking Morgellons Fibers video.
[01:54:22.118 --> 01:54:23.898]  I'm going to pull it back up to the home page.
[01:54:24.399 --> 01:54:26.220]  It's only 2 minutes and 25 seconds.
[01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:29.441]  And it's one of the most impressive videos you'll ever see.
[01:54:29.981 --> 01:54:30.682]  It's remarkable.
[01:54:31.842 --> 01:54:32.603]  So there's that.
[01:54:32.683 --> 01:54:34.684]  I hope this has been helpful to people out there.
[01:54:34.704 --> 01:54:40.787]  And all I can suggest to your listeners, and which I do to my listeners as well, is don't go to your doctor.
[01:54:41.314 --> 01:54:42.455]  Don't go to your dermatologist.
[01:54:42.475 --> 01:54:43.276]  Don't waste your time.
[01:54:43.836 --> 01:54:44.917]  Do your own research.
[01:54:45.278 --> 01:54:48.000]  Read the material on Rents.com.
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:50.102]  Do a Google search if that's not enough for you.
[01:54:50.222 --> 01:54:51.203]  But keep reading.
[01:54:51.263 --> 01:54:52.144]  Keep looking.
[01:54:52.425 --> 01:54:59.711]  There is a Morgellons Board for people who can write in, talk with each other, share experiences, get support that way.
[01:55:00.452 --> 01:55:02.094]  Depression is a common one.
[01:55:02.734 --> 01:55:05.457]  People feel shunned, like they have leprosy, don't want to go out.
[01:55:06.224 --> 01:55:08.025]  We just don't know how communicable this is.
[01:55:08.065 --> 01:55:13.846]  The story of Billy Coke, the Oakland A's baseball pitcher, who three years ago was the number one reliever in baseball, had 44 saves.
[01:55:14.426 --> 01:55:15.306]  He's out of baseball.
[01:55:15.346 --> 01:55:15.606]  Through.
[01:55:15.706 --> 01:55:16.027]  Finished.
[01:55:16.047 --> 01:55:16.967]  He got more gallons.
[01:55:17.567 --> 01:55:22.888]  In his case, it involved messing with his neurological system to the extent that he had muscle twitching.
[01:55:23.208 --> 01:55:23.848]  He couldn't pitch.
[01:55:24.589 --> 01:55:25.389]  So he had to quit.
[01:55:25.969 --> 01:55:29.450]  His wife and all three of their little children have it now.
[01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:32.471]  So it is vectorable.
[01:55:32.651 --> 01:55:33.711]  We just don't know how.
[01:55:35.077 --> 01:55:40.981]  Well, Jeff, I really appreciate you joining us and I guess I'm back on your show the 24th or something?
[01:55:41.561 --> 01:55:42.722]  24th, Tuesday, yes.
[01:55:43.343 --> 01:55:46.785]  That would be something that God only knows what will happen between now and then.
[01:55:47.025 --> 01:55:48.986]  Alright, Jeff, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:55:49.006 --> 01:55:50.187]  Thanks for inviting me, Alex.
[01:55:50.227 --> 01:55:50.908]  Thanks very much.
[01:55:51.088 --> 01:55:51.408]  You bet.
[01:55:51.428 --> 01:55:52.008]  God bless you.
[01:55:52.409 --> 01:55:54.690]  There goes Jeff from Rents.com.
[01:55:54.730 --> 01:55:55.271]  Jeff Rents.
[01:55:55.851 --> 01:55:57.272]  And a lot of you have been asking me about it.
[01:55:57.332 --> 01:56:03.176]  I've watched a bunch of newscast clips and CNN and read government reports and documents and
[01:56:04.108 --> 01:56:07.050]  I think in some of the cases there's definitely something going on.
[01:56:07.871 --> 01:56:17.958]  I've got to tell you, though, that in my experience with crazy people, but maybe they weren't crazy, you know?
[01:56:18.719 --> 01:56:24.803]  People think I'm crazy because I say there's a North American Union and I say the government might be corrupt, or that the honeybees are dying.
[01:56:25.804 --> 01:56:28.406]  You know, they call anybody who thinks the government killed Kennedy when
[01:56:29.056 --> 01:56:33.218]  The president's lawyer, the president's mistress, and now the head of the shooters have all gone public.
[01:56:33.718 --> 01:56:34.639]  Saying the government killed him.
[01:56:35.419 --> 01:56:43.203]  So, uh, but I remember folks, you know, over the years coming up and saying, I've got chips under my skin, and I've got this stuff coming out from under my skin.
[01:56:43.263 --> 01:56:48.526]  And then when I tell them, okay, well thank you, I don't have time to really help you because I don't know how to help you.
[01:56:49.106 --> 01:56:49.787]  What, you're with them?
[01:56:49.827 --> 01:56:50.947]  Have they gotten to you?
[01:56:51.668 --> 01:56:53.008]  Are they telling you not to?
[01:56:53.108 --> 01:56:55.029]  And I'm just like, man, come on!
[01:56:55.810 --> 01:56:56.630]  Come on!
[01:56:56.650 --> 01:56:56.690]  So,
[01:57:00.916 --> 01:57:25.087]  Because of all, so many times, I've said that's not real, that's not happening, that's not going on, and it's turned out to be the case, that on this, because the Mayo Clinic and some other clinics have said there could be something there, we covered it, and I think Jeff is an incredible, smart guy, and has an open mind on a lot of issues, so we interviewed him on that subject, and we appreciate him coming on.
[01:57:25.754 --> 01:57:31.337]  Alright, when we get back, I'm just going to open the phones up and we're going to be taking your calls and we're going to do a bunch of really important news.
[01:57:33.498 --> 01:57:38.400]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.114 --> 01:57:50.755]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.415 --> 01:57:52.477]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.177 --> 01:57:54.298]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.959 --> 01:57:55.760]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.541 --> 01:57:57.382]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.082 --> 01:58:01.926]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.287 --> 01:58:06.351]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:25.563 --> 01:58:26.805]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:26.865 --> 01:58:27.325]  Welcome.
[01:58:27.365 --> 01:58:30.808]  We are now into the third and final hour today.
[01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:35.052]  And I had a guest coming on, but we're just not going to do it.
[01:58:35.652 --> 01:58:40.716]  I'm going to get into the Rolling Stone lead headline.
[01:58:40.736 --> 01:58:44.900]  You know, a few weeks ago, E. Howard Hunt of the Plumbers on Watergate
[01:58:45.501 --> 01:58:54.347]  He's the guy that led the failed Bay of Pigs invasion here and covered operations overthrowing nations like Guatemala and scores of others.
[01:58:58.009 --> 01:59:07.316]  And lo and behold, before he died, he wrote in handwritten notes about how he was the lead commander of the shooters.
[01:59:08.176 --> 01:59:09.357]  Of course, we always knew that.
[01:59:09.377 --> 01:59:15.241]  There were three photographs taken by the Dallas Times Herald, now defunct.
[01:59:16.924 --> 01:59:22.946]  of uh... Mr. Hunt and two other well-known high-level CIA operatives.
[01:59:23.006 --> 01:59:25.126]  I mean it's spitting images of all three of them.
[01:59:27.827 --> 01:59:28.727]  It isn't one of them.
[01:59:28.747 --> 01:59:29.468]  It isn't two of them.
[01:59:29.528 --> 01:59:30.308]  It's all three of them.
[01:59:30.348 --> 01:59:31.048]  There's the tramps.
[01:59:31.188 --> 01:59:32.929]  All well-known CIA operatives.
[01:59:33.349 --> 01:59:34.209]  Extremely famous.
[01:59:35.229 --> 01:59:37.130]  And you see Hunt trying to make funny faces.
[01:59:37.150 --> 01:59:38.910]  He like tries to form his face all up.
[01:59:39.230 --> 01:59:43.992]  You know, he like frowns and tries to look like Gomer Pyle or somebody or uh...
[01:59:47.887 --> 01:59:50.048]  Now, who's the guy that, uh, Elmer Fudd?
[01:59:50.088 --> 01:59:55.589]  You know, the other guys don't, uh, try to disguise their faces as well as he did.
[01:59:56.429 --> 02:00:08.092]  But there's one photo where he's walking out of the, walking out of, uh, the police station, and, you know, before he sees the camera, and it's clearly him, then he starts deforming his face up, and really squanching it.
[02:00:08.772 --> 02:00:10.073]  Pretty slick of him, actually.
[02:00:10.093 --> 02:00:11.633]  I mean, we already knew that.
[02:00:11.653 --> 02:00:12.994]  We don't need you to confess.
[02:00:13.014 --> 02:00:14.394]  We already know the government killed Kennedy.
[02:00:17.501 --> 02:00:23.865]  I interviewed Barr McClellan, who was LBJ's lawyer for 15 years, about LBJ talking about how he had Kennedy killed.
[02:00:25.045 --> 02:00:28.867]  And I interviewed his late mistress, who was his admitted mistress and had his only son.
[02:00:30.528 --> 02:00:37.392]  And I've interviewed all the big experts on the JFK assassination, and we know the facts of what happened there.
[02:00:37.432 --> 02:00:41.194]  But I will go over a little bit more of the E. Howard Hunt story.
[02:00:43.405 --> 02:00:51.007]  If you tuned in during the first hour and you heard me talk about how here in Austin, Texas, we had their official plans a couple years ago.
[02:00:51.427 --> 02:01:03.870]  Every major road, Mopac, I-35, William Cannon, 360, 290, there are 14 of them, 14 major roads, toll roads.
[02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:07.431]  Or 10 roads and a couple of them have several toll roads on them.
[02:01:10.296 --> 02:01:21.287]  Now, that affects you, because I have a stack of news here where they're doing the same thing in England, same thing in Illinois, same thing in Wisconsin, same thing in Ohio, same thing in New Jersey, same thing in Florida, same thing in Kansas, same thing in Indiana.
[02:01:21.367 --> 02:01:22.268]  I mean, it's the same everywhere.
[02:01:25.811 --> 02:01:32.258]  But in Texas, we always do it bigger and better, so the total handover of the infrastructure is just more intense here.
[02:01:34.267 --> 02:01:35.268]  And a few years ahead.
[02:01:35.748 --> 02:01:41.290]  And so now there's... everybody's freaking out because the people couldn't believe me when I had the official Text.Map saying it.
[02:01:41.650 --> 02:01:46.253]  Now that the statesman says they're going to turn Mopac, then that is the big enchilada, folks.
[02:01:47.073 --> 02:01:49.234]  That's the big road that Austinites get around on.
[02:01:49.274 --> 02:01:50.515]  Big highway from end to end.
[02:01:50.935 --> 02:01:51.775]  Very well designed.
[02:01:53.416 --> 02:01:58.078]  They are going to take the lanes of that sucker, and they are going to put toll roads on it.
[02:01:59.519 --> 02:01:59.939]  And, uh...
[02:02:01.696 --> 02:02:07.459]  But don't worry, they're having a meeting tomorrow, and then a meeting on Wednesday for you to comment on, and then that's it!
[02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:12.922]  And if you don't like it, try going through there without your transponder, it'll track you.
[02:02:13.342 --> 02:02:17.645]  If you don't pay the tickets, they'll come arrest you, and if you resist, they'll blow your head off!
[02:02:18.565 --> 02:02:20.706]  They'll put four or five bullets in you, how's that sound?
[02:02:21.087 --> 02:02:21.987]  They know who they work for!
[02:02:22.047 --> 02:02:24.448]  The foreign corporations that own this country!
[02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:27.050]  Alright?
[02:02:29.137 --> 02:02:30.058]  They know who feeds them.
[02:02:30.098 --> 02:02:32.420]  These dogs know who puts the food in their dish.
[02:02:34.361 --> 02:02:36.302]  Alright, we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:36.883 --> 02:02:37.783]  On the other side.
[02:02:37.864 --> 02:02:38.324]  Stay with me.
[02:02:48.934 --> 02:02:54.378]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.758 --> 02:03:02.363]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:03.095 --> 02:03:10.159]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.539 --> 02:03:21.945]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.285 --> 02:03:25.867]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.228 --> 02:03:28.189]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.509 --> 02:03:32.351]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:47.501 --> 02:03:52.005]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:52.345 --> 02:03:56.428]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:56.728 --> 02:03:57.289]  We listened.
[02:03:57.589 --> 02:04:02.573]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:02.853 --> 02:04:03.333]  We listened.
[02:04:03.714 --> 02:04:06.756]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:07.176 --> 02:04:07.717]  We listened.
[02:04:08.177 --> 02:04:11.760]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:12.200]  We're good.
[02:04:28.590 --> 02:04:31.232]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.

[02:05:46.434 --> 02:05:48.616]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.196 --> 02:05:57.322]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:59.543 --> 02:06:01.945]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:01.965 --> 02:06:02.165]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:14.298 --> 02:06:23.163]  Let me get into this report again, and I'd like the callers to maybe comment on this, or the Kennedy assassination, or Mergellin's, it doesn't matter.
[02:06:25.004 --> 02:06:27.506]  I hope to heaven this Mergellin's thing isn't real.
[02:06:27.626 --> 02:06:35.790]  I just, but... We know these technologies exist, and we know the government's doing stuff publicly that's just as dangerous or more so.
[02:06:36.691 --> 02:06:38.352]  So I just don't doubt it anymore.
[02:06:39.072 --> 02:06:42.514]  Believe me, I wish it was just a bunch of schizophrenics freaking out.
[02:06:47.128 --> 02:06:50.992]  But we've covered the topic with an expert on it, so there you have it.
[02:06:52.093 --> 02:06:57.298]  Revolution, flash mobs, brain chips, a grim vision of the future.
[02:06:58.719 --> 02:07:07.087]  Information chips implanted in the brain, electromagnetic pulse weapons, the middle class becoming revolutionary, taking on the role of Marxist proletariat.
[02:07:07.975 --> 02:07:19.600]  The population of countries in the Middle East increasing by 132 percent, while Europe drops as fertility falls, flash mobs, groups rapidly mobilized by criminal gangs or terrorist groups.
[02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:23.481]  Now let me take the time out, now that we have it, to analyze that first paragraph.
[02:07:23.501 --> 02:07:24.842]  This is a Ministry of Defense report.
[02:07:25.882 --> 02:07:27.523]  This is what they say they believe will happen.
[02:07:28.343 --> 02:07:31.184]  This is not, I mean, they only put these out every ten years.
[02:07:31.204 --> 02:07:32.045]  This is a big deal.
[02:07:33.105 --> 02:07:37.327]  By the way, I've seen fragments of classified that have been, you know, segments released
[02:07:38.215 --> 02:07:42.936]  Or scientists that have been in classified briefings have published their studies that went into U.S.
[02:07:42.976 --> 02:07:45.256]  briefings that show a similar picture.
[02:07:47.677 --> 02:07:49.617]  Information chips implanted in the brain.
[02:07:50.397 --> 02:08:05.380]  Well, number one, the January 2000 Federation of American Scientists report released classified 1999 Internal Defense Department report conducted for the Army.
[02:08:06.556 --> 02:08:08.197]  And this is in my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[02:08:08.877 --> 02:08:10.478]  It's all over the web still.
[02:08:10.518 --> 02:08:11.218]  You can find it.
[02:08:12.118 --> 02:08:14.119]  It was at the Federation of American Scientists.
[02:08:14.139 --> 02:08:15.680]  There was a request that they remove it.
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:24.063]  Then the Pentagon got upset and used that as an example in a press report saying we're tired of classified material being brought forward.
[02:08:24.423 --> 02:08:32.046]  And it said that by 2025, everyone would be implanted with brain chips.
[02:08:34.289 --> 02:08:40.632]  And that they would legitimize this through fads, through style, for security, and with prisoners.
[02:08:41.772 --> 02:08:43.533]  And they even talk about how they're going to sell it to us.
[02:08:44.713 --> 02:08:49.955]  And basically, they're going to say, microchip, microchip, microchip, imply digital solutions under the skin.
[02:08:50.296 --> 02:08:51.076]  We're going to track you.
[02:08:51.096 --> 02:08:52.436]  It keeps you safe from the predators.
[02:08:52.757 --> 02:08:54.437]  Makes it safer for you to go into work.
[02:08:54.797 --> 02:08:55.758]  Oh my gosh, it's great.
[02:08:57.078 --> 02:08:59.099]  99% of major polls are against it.
[02:08:59.399 --> 02:09:00.099]  I mean, they've had polls.
[02:09:00.380 --> 02:09:00.860]  It's in the high 90s.
[02:09:02.995 --> 02:09:03.415]  Doesn't matter.
[02:09:03.435 --> 02:09:06.537]  They'll just keep repeating it, repeating it, repeating it, repeating it until you're acclimated.
[02:09:06.577 --> 02:09:07.457]  You almost expect it.
[02:09:07.497 --> 02:09:08.517]  Okay, where's my chip?
[02:09:08.778 --> 02:09:10.298]  I've heard about it five million times!
[02:09:12.439 --> 02:09:18.902]  But let me tell you, they take them at your favorite Baja Beach Club, your favorite Miami Party Club that's, you know, the highest end.
[02:09:19.142 --> 02:09:22.884]  You want to get into the VIP section that's basically got the legal hookers in it?
[02:09:23.364 --> 02:09:24.804]  Well, you gotta take the chip!
[02:09:26.185 --> 02:09:27.405]  You know, it's a free enrollment.
[02:09:27.425 --> 02:09:27.886]  Don't worry.
[02:09:27.926 --> 02:09:28.566]  It's so cool.
[02:09:29.324 --> 02:09:33.185]  And literally, a sexy girl rubs your shoulders while they put the chip in you.
[02:09:33.725 --> 02:09:39.946]  I mean, how much more manipulative and corporate baiting is that?
[02:09:39.986 --> 02:09:43.487]  I mean, they bait you like you're mindless idiots.
[02:09:44.688 --> 02:09:46.448]  Is there nothing you won't fall for?
[02:09:46.528 --> 02:09:47.648]  Is there nothing I won't fall for?
[02:09:47.688 --> 02:09:48.268]  I'm weak too.
[02:09:49.209 --> 02:09:50.969]  I mean, this is just pathetic.
[02:09:52.825 --> 02:10:03.652]  And then they have like the Chipmobile, they trademark Get Chipped, and I have the CEO on, their founding scientist, I have distributors on, and they're like, the chip will prevail, and start laughing when they're on the air with us.
[02:10:04.513 --> 02:10:06.034]  Then it's an IBM front company.
[02:10:07.515 --> 02:10:09.576]  You see, this is how they operate.
[02:10:11.958 --> 02:10:13.819]  They just condition you till you accept it.
[02:10:13.859 --> 02:10:17.602]  So, there, it's a long article, and I've covered one line of it.
[02:10:18.462 --> 02:10:26.145]  Information chips implanted in the brain, electromagnetic pulse weapons, the middle class becoming revolutionary, taking on the role of Marxist proletariat.
[02:10:26.405 --> 02:10:31.207]  So they don't really say we're going to be communist, but they say we'll take on the role of the proletariat.
[02:10:31.447 --> 02:10:33.248]  Then later they say we will be Marxist.
[02:10:34.668 --> 02:10:41.531]  Again, the elite knew there was going to be a revolution against their opulence and their conspicuous consumption and their corruption.
[02:10:41.551 --> 02:10:43.592]  It was not free market, it was criminally consolidated.
[02:10:45.265 --> 02:10:50.849]  So they come in to head off the logical extension of the Renaissance and tell the middle class, we're going to get the richies.
[02:10:50.889 --> 02:10:56.914]  But really it was the poor working class, the super poor, targeting the middle class for the elite.
[02:10:58.575 --> 02:11:08.383]  Because believe me folks, somebody who's getting paid $15,000 a year, they think somebody making $100,000 is rich.
[02:11:08.403 --> 02:11:11.265]  They think you're opulently rich if you've got a nice car and a decent house.
[02:11:12.396 --> 02:11:26.908]  And believe me, if some leaders tell them that they're going to get money, and they're going to be wealthy, and get some blingy-bling in the democracy, where 51% can take your land, 51% don't even take that in Austin.
[02:11:26.948 --> 02:11:29.631]  If a minority wants your ranch or farm, they take it.
[02:11:29.971 --> 02:11:39.239]  That minority environmental group is told it's going to be a park, and then they're not the darlings, though, a few years later, once it's turned into a golf course or high-rise apartments.
[02:11:40.010 --> 02:11:48.481]  Now they're actually barred by the police because they're troublemakers from going into city council meetings and they'll cry outside in the hall and go, you were right, we left it to you Alex.
[02:11:48.501 --> 02:11:49.362]  I'm like, yes.
[02:11:50.363 --> 02:11:55.469]  You were used to create the illusion of a mob of people wanting this.
[02:11:57.512 --> 02:11:58.313]  And it's going to be bad.
[02:11:59.634 --> 02:12:18.951]  You've got Latin Americans who've never been allowed to have freedom, never been allowed to have any type of free market, who've been peons, total slaves, since Mesoamerica, forget the Spanish arrival 500 years ago, and they want a taste of rebellion, and they're going to be given a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist rampage, and they're going to burn down most of this country!
[02:12:20.592 --> 02:12:21.433]  Unless we turn them around.
[02:12:21.473 --> 02:12:22.494]  I mean, just watch.
[02:12:23.054 --> 02:12:26.237]  Later, like everything else I've said that comes true, you just watch.
[02:12:28.266 --> 02:12:31.128]  I might burn down the country, you know, 15, 20 major cities.
[02:12:31.849 --> 02:12:32.209]  Burnt.
[02:12:33.490 --> 02:12:35.052]  Large portions decimated.
[02:12:36.933 --> 02:12:38.535]  Incinerated, quite literally.
[02:12:40.096 --> 02:12:42.378]  And, uh, it'll be like French Canada.
[02:12:42.678 --> 02:12:51.706]  Large portion will still be under a larger North American governance, but as long as they feel like they're not under the U.S., there'll be a, yeah, yeah, alright!
[02:12:53.351 --> 02:12:57.214]  And man, well, I got three articles, no, four articles on this.
[02:12:57.494 --> 02:12:59.436]  They're trying to pass total gun bans in L.A.
[02:12:59.496 --> 02:13:00.517]  right now, and you know what?
[02:13:00.537 --> 02:13:01.398]  Looks like they're going to get it.
[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:14.308]  Because as long as the leadership puts up billboards saying it's Mexico, and as long as they tell them the Raza buzz, they want to hear and pat them on the head.
[02:13:14.348 --> 02:13:15.769]  The corporates know, man, they know how to...
[02:13:17.620 --> 02:13:25.506]  They tell the middle classes, black, white, hispanic, sit down, shut up, go along, don't make waves, because we've got wealth to fight them, at least for a little bit longer.
[02:13:26.267 --> 02:13:27.207]  But they're almost there.
[02:13:28.168 --> 02:13:38.616]  But the so-called downtrodden groups, oh my gosh, they tell them to be radical, cause problems, but that's only to threaten the middle class into submission under the ruling elite.
[02:13:38.636 --> 02:13:41.498]  See, the middle class also thinks it's teamed up with the elite.
[02:13:42.225 --> 02:13:51.554]  They think they're the elite, while the elite are manipulating the giant third-world hordes, who I individually don't even dislike.
[02:13:52.775 --> 02:13:56.438]  But as a force, they are our destruction, and their own destruction, too.
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:13:59.641]  It is not a pretty picture.
[02:13:59.821 --> 02:14:01.843]  Oh, and the British report says this, by the way.
[02:14:03.485 --> 02:14:05.146]  I mean, let me give you an example of this.
[02:14:05.326 --> 02:14:06.828]  Absolute cast-iron proof.
[02:14:11.980 --> 02:14:23.205]  Let me give you absolute proof of this, because this is a very important subject.
[02:14:23.225 --> 02:14:23.845]  Well, you know what?
[02:14:23.885 --> 02:14:29.368]  Let me just... You ever do that, folks?
[02:14:29.848 --> 02:14:38.412]  Everybody's got this oak allergy, so my head's all stocked up, and I was trying to call up all the data in my brain to make a point, and then
[02:14:41.292 --> 02:14:42.473]  Didn't remember what the point was.
[02:14:42.493 --> 02:14:49.777]  Because I'm so busy trying to, kind of dingy today, trying to call up the point I was going to make.
[02:14:50.637 --> 02:14:53.099]  That doesn't happen very often, but it happens more and more and I don't like it.
[02:14:53.939 --> 02:14:54.840]  John, were you listening?
[02:14:54.900 --> 02:14:56.040]  I said I was going to make a point.
[02:14:57.941 --> 02:14:59.302]  Yeah, you were doing 10 tasks as usual.
[02:15:00.242 --> 02:15:01.583]  I know the listeners could tell me.
[02:15:02.103 --> 02:15:04.125]  As soon as I don't want to know, as soon as we've got a break, I'll remember.
[02:15:06.566 --> 02:15:08.327]  Oh, I was talking about absolute proof.
[02:15:09.424 --> 02:15:16.227]  Of the illegal aliens being tools of the new world order and the Muslims being tools and all of it.
[02:15:16.707 --> 02:15:17.767]  I don't dislike Muslims.
[02:15:18.888 --> 02:15:22.029]  I don't dislike Mexicans from Mexico.
[02:15:23.670 --> 02:15:38.056]  I mean, I find it a little frightening, you know, that every city bus in Austin has a big Mexican flag and says, we're taking over on it and, you know, we're the invaders, ha ha ha, I mean, with a guy with a crazy look on his face and six hundred and seventy something billboards in L.A.
[02:15:38.076 --> 02:15:38.796]  saying L.A.'
[02:15:38.776 --> 02:15:38.816]  's
[02:15:39.816 --> 02:15:44.780]  Mexico, I mean, you know, it's, it's, it's... And I'm scared because I know who's behind it.
[02:15:46.442 --> 02:15:49.444]  Man, I tell you what, it'll get your attention real quick.
[02:15:50.946 --> 02:15:52.547]  They're going to do here what they did in Russia.
[02:15:52.667 --> 02:15:52.927]  Man.
[02:15:54.549 --> 02:15:55.549]  It's going to be rough, folks.
[02:15:55.569 --> 02:15:56.410]  It's going to be rough.
[02:15:57.891 --> 02:16:03.636]  But... Of course, when they're done with the illegals, it won't be pretty.
[02:16:04.237 --> 02:16:08.000]  But... Going back, take London, take England.
[02:16:09.637 --> 02:16:13.419]  They have basically unlimited Islamic immigration to England.
[02:16:13.539 --> 02:16:15.319]  I mean, it is just massive.
[02:16:15.860 --> 02:16:18.721]  London is now half-foreigner.
[02:16:19.381 --> 02:16:19.761]  Okay?
[02:16:19.821 --> 02:16:21.382]  The country will soon be half-foreigner.
[02:16:21.402 --> 02:16:22.482]  You've got to go look at these numbers there.
[02:16:23.843 --> 02:16:26.064]  And the majority of the foreigners are Muslims.
[02:16:28.124 --> 02:16:29.105]  Now, take our nation.
[02:16:29.425 --> 02:16:30.545]  The Muslims are going to kill us.
[02:16:30.565 --> 02:16:31.226]  They're going to get us.
[02:16:31.306 --> 02:16:33.247]  Oh my God, they all want to slit our throats.
[02:16:33.607 --> 02:16:36.428]  But Bush has done nothing to curb their immigration here.
[02:16:37.008 --> 02:16:38.189]  They've done nothing to... See?
[02:16:39.944 --> 02:16:41.484]  It's made up, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:43.205 --> 02:16:48.506]  All the stock of security, all the stock of fight and terror, they're not doing anything, okay?
[02:16:48.826 --> 02:16:51.407]  The border's more open than it was, as you know, before 9-11.
[02:16:51.587 --> 02:16:52.827]  There's less border patrol.
[02:16:53.107 --> 02:16:53.727]  But you know what?
[02:16:55.087 --> 02:17:01.349]  The number of cops doubled under Bill Clinton, and now it's almost doubled in seven years, almost seven years of Bush.
[02:17:03.369 --> 02:17:06.390]  You know how many cops there were when Clinton got into office nationwide?
[02:17:08.070 --> 02:17:11.171]  200,000.
[02:17:08.450 --> 02:17:11.171]  There were almost 600,000 when he left.
[02:17:11.571 --> 02:17:13.572]  And ladies and gentlemen, we've passed a million.
[02:17:16.352 --> 02:17:17.513]  And they're just getting started.
[02:17:18.313 --> 02:17:20.013]  And I had a stack of news we covered Friday.
[02:17:21.254 --> 02:17:22.374]  Draw OK on your desk.
[02:17:22.414 --> 02:17:23.114]  You're arrested.
[02:17:24.235 --> 02:17:25.575]  $5 parking ticket.
[02:17:25.595 --> 02:17:26.595]  They seize your house.
[02:17:28.436 --> 02:17:30.116]  A kid's not wearing a helmet on a bicycle.
[02:17:30.136 --> 02:17:31.597]  The police taser him and tackle him.
[02:17:32.117 --> 02:17:35.978]  You know, I mean, it's just a total, massive get you in the system.
[02:17:36.724 --> 02:17:37.864]  Arrest you for nothing.
[02:17:38.585 --> 02:17:43.766]  But the illegals, they can drunk drive, get bank accounts without IDs, and do whatever they want.

[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:37.321]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:37.521 --> 02:18:41.323]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:41.423 --> 02:18:43.544]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:43.584 --> 02:18:48.327]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:19:03.286 --> 02:19:07.890]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:08.810 --> 02:19:16.076]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[02:19:49.730 --> 02:19:52.551]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:19:52.932 --> 02:19:55.693]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?

[02:20:47.665 --> 02:20:51.788]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:20:52.008 --> 02:20:53.769]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:20:54.030 --> 02:21:00.314]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:21:00.614 --> 02:21:06.738]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:21:06.979 --> 02:21:13.023]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[02:21:13.303 --> 02:21:19.706]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.

[02:21:36.054 --> 02:21:36.114]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:22:00.367 --> 02:22:00.567]  Alright.
[02:22:00.587 --> 02:22:03.810]  I'm going to get into the JFK thing.
[02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:08.634]  I'm going to get more into this M.O.D.
[02:22:08.694 --> 02:22:12.197]  report about the future of the next 30 years.
[02:22:12.297 --> 02:22:14.539]  And you can forget 30 years.
[02:22:14.639 --> 02:22:16.861]  Try the next 10, the next 5.
[02:22:29.209 --> 02:22:33.412]  But we're going to go to Ryan, Luke, Phil, Brock, Sammy, or Samuel.
[02:22:33.432 --> 02:22:34.273]  We're going to go to everybody.
[02:22:35.033 --> 02:22:42.378]  Luke Rodowski there with 9-11 Truth in New York, a hard charger taking action and fighting the New World Order, which we like.
[02:22:42.758 --> 02:22:47.462]  He's going to have another demonstration Wednesday out there in support of Rosie O'Donnell, who's back in town now.
[02:22:48.082 --> 02:22:50.684]  Look for some surprises perhaps this week, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:50.704 --> 02:22:51.184]  We'll see.
[02:22:51.985 --> 02:22:54.186]  But Luke, thanks for popping in.
[02:22:54.406 --> 02:22:55.167]  Tell us what's going on.
[02:22:55.734 --> 02:22:56.675]  Thanks for having me, man.
[02:22:56.995 --> 02:23:00.698]  Yeah, this Wednesday, we're going to be outside ABC Studios, 9.30 a.m.
[02:23:00.999 --> 02:23:04.782]  Just like we did about two weeks ago, just to show support for Rosie O'Donnell.
[02:23:05.122 --> 02:23:17.293]  I mean, last time we did it, last time we did this demonstration of support, the next couple of days, Rosie O'Donnell came out with a nine-minute rant about Building 7 for about, you know, on The View, that reached about 30 million people.
[02:23:17.313 --> 02:23:21.657]  So we're going to do it again, just to show her support, and to show the neocons that, you know,
[02:23:22.136 --> 02:23:23.157]  She's not a lunatic.
[02:23:23.197 --> 02:23:26.140]  She's, you know, doing the right thing and there's family members.
[02:23:26.380 --> 02:23:27.701]  Give folks the time and place.
[02:23:28.222 --> 02:23:32.846]  It's going to be at ABC Studios, 930 Wednesday, April 11th.
[02:23:33.547 --> 02:23:36.029]  ABC Studios is West Bend Avenue.
[02:23:36.890 --> 02:23:39.192]  I mean, all the information is on wearechange.org.
[02:23:39.553 --> 02:23:41.815]  Just go on wearechange.org and all the information is on there.
[02:23:42.295 --> 02:23:46.379]  Okay, and I want you to call in with a report in the first hour on what happened Wednesday.
[02:23:46.399 --> 02:23:47.400]  Not a problem.
[02:23:48.044 --> 02:23:48.784]  Good to hear from you.
[02:23:48.804 --> 02:23:50.986]  Look for... well, I'm not going to say it.
[02:23:51.266 --> 02:23:51.926]  I'll see you, Luke.
[02:23:52.426 --> 02:23:53.467]  Good talking to you, my friend.
[02:23:53.507 --> 02:23:54.047]  Great guy.
[02:23:54.527 --> 02:23:55.668]  Ryan in California.
[02:23:55.708 --> 02:23:56.428]  Ryan, go ahead.
[02:23:56.448 --> 02:23:57.869]  Hi, Alex.
[02:23:57.889 --> 02:23:58.529]  How are you doing?
[02:23:58.729 --> 02:23:58.990]  Good.
[02:23:59.750 --> 02:24:13.517]  Yeah, I just actually wanted to let you know I was listening to the conversation about the Morgellons and a friend of mine actually was telling me he had a skin infection and that he was pulling out some stuff that he thought was fat that his doctor told him was just normal and it was fat.
[02:24:14.435 --> 02:24:21.184]  And he was talking to me about it like it was normal and asking me, you know, those fibers that are in your skin that are fat, when you have an infection.
[02:24:21.204 --> 02:24:22.586]  And I said, no, I don't know.
[02:24:23.147 --> 02:24:26.271]  And he kept on talking about it a little bit.
[02:24:26.852 --> 02:24:29.075]  He didn't say much more than that, but I found it very odd.
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:32.141]  Overheard the conversation you were having?
[02:24:32.161 --> 02:24:35.123]  Yeah, well, this guy's been my best friend since I was three years old.
[02:24:35.143 --> 02:24:43.509]  Yeah, unfortunately, I've been trying to get him to change his mind and listen to your show, but he's a real tough one to convert, so... I have tried to get him to sit down and watch it with me, but I've played parts of it with him and he's usually...
[02:25:01.397 --> 02:25:03.020]  Pretty skeptical about that.
[02:25:03.662 --> 02:25:09.673]  And I bet he thinks Lee Harvey Oswald threw a tree in six seconds, got three shots off with a bolt-action rifle.
[02:25:10.684 --> 02:25:11.705]  Well, he's not too into that.
[02:25:12.045 --> 02:25:15.106]  He does want to be a police officer, and I've been trying to talk him out of that.
[02:25:15.166 --> 02:25:22.549]  So to him, again, to be a police officer, you only worship what the government says, because the government is America, and the people are the enemy, right?
[02:25:22.689 --> 02:25:26.571]  That's why we have militarized police, hence the people are the enemy, the police are God.
[02:25:27.251 --> 02:25:28.412]  Well, I hope he enjoys that.
[02:25:28.732 --> 02:25:31.233]  But why don't you give him a copy of the Rolling Stone magazine?
[02:25:31.753 --> 02:25:40.361]  With the admitted former, you know, clandestine chief officer on, you know, deathbed confession of killing Kennedy.
[02:25:40.902 --> 02:25:42.724]  Maybe that'll have some effect on him.
[02:25:43.064 --> 02:25:48.049]  I'm sure there's something out there with all this news out there that I can get him to wake up sooner or later.
[02:25:48.089 --> 02:25:48.829]  I'm hoping so.
[02:25:49.490 --> 02:25:50.011]  Absolutely.
[02:25:50.051 --> 02:25:51.052]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:25:51.592 --> 02:25:53.534]  Let's go ahead and talk to Phil in Canada.
[02:25:53.554 --> 02:25:54.094]  You're on the air.
[02:25:54.114 --> 02:25:54.495]  Go ahead.
[02:25:54.997 --> 02:25:55.817]  Good morning, Alex.
[02:25:55.877 --> 02:25:59.218]  Well, you know, I don't know if we're ever going to see that Rolling Stone magazine.
[02:25:59.459 --> 02:26:05.841]  The way I look at it right now, it looks like Backroom Boys have blocked the Rolling Stone website.
[02:26:06.041 --> 02:26:06.941]  It's offline.
[02:26:07.841 --> 02:26:13.103]  The only way you can contact it now is if you take off the www dot.
[02:26:13.483 --> 02:26:16.424]  Well, they might just be having a web problem because the story got big.
[02:26:16.724 --> 02:26:18.085]  We saved the article.
[02:26:18.385 --> 02:26:20.986]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:26:21.511 --> 02:26:22.392]  Well, that's wonderful.
[02:26:22.412 --> 02:26:26.715]  You know, we might not have a week or a month or the next five years.
[02:26:26.795 --> 02:26:28.176]  It could be the next five minutes.
[02:26:28.256 --> 02:26:31.919]  These people could kill John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy.
[02:26:32.259 --> 02:26:35.101]  They can kill 3,000 people on September the 11th.
[02:26:35.142 --> 02:26:38.724]  They can kill 30,000 or 50,000 or as many as it takes.
[02:26:39.245 --> 02:26:39.745]  No, you're right.
[02:26:39.785 --> 02:26:40.666]  That's why we're fighting them.
[02:26:41.446 --> 02:26:43.148]  And we've got to stick together on this.
[02:26:43.228 --> 02:26:47.311]  I think everybody who's got a website, everybody who's got a file-sharing program,
[02:26:48.007 --> 02:27:05.255]  You should be taking off everything else but Terror Storm and the truth about 9-11, the movies, if you have copies of them, and just be sharing that information and putting that out there to everybody that you know, as much as you possibly can to get as many people
[02:27:06.096 --> 02:27:08.277]  Because it's just strength in numbers here, Alex.
[02:27:08.337 --> 02:27:09.198]  No, you're right, Phil.
[02:27:09.218 --> 02:27:17.743]  We need the maximum output in the InfoWar on 9-11 Truth because that's the foundation of everything they're doing geopolitically and domestically.
[02:27:18.303 --> 02:27:19.624]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:27:19.724 --> 02:27:21.365]  Please go to Google Video, folks.
[02:27:21.785 --> 02:27:25.867]  Get the link to TerrorStorm for free and get it out to everybody you know.
[02:27:26.228 --> 02:27:27.048]  Anything else, Phil?
[02:27:27.348 --> 02:27:28.769]  No, thank you very much, Alex.
[02:27:28.789 --> 02:27:29.570]  Just get that out.
[02:27:29.710 --> 02:27:30.590]  Get that message out.
[02:27:30.650 --> 02:27:31.391]  I will, I will.
[02:27:31.431 --> 02:27:32.791]  More calls, more news.
[02:27:33.012 --> 02:27:33.472]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.050 --> 02:27:39.071]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.091 --> 02:27:42.751]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.412 --> 02:27:47.392]  How are you feeling today?
[02:27:47.612 --> 02:27:48.092]  Why ask?
[02:27:48.153 --> 02:27:54.334]  Because if you have health challenges, then reading our free e-booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[02:27:54.574 --> 02:27:59.035]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call Mangosteen.
[02:27:59.335 --> 02:28:05.016]  It's a centuries-old medicinal fruit whose time has come, and it has amassed 40 years of published research.
[02:28:05.316 --> 02:28:10.402]  We have information and testimonials from all over the world about the health potential of this amazing fruit.
[02:28:10.642 --> 02:28:17.149]  The powerful botanical has contributed to the well-being of millions of people the world over with health concerns just like yours.
[02:28:17.489 --> 02:28:20.653]  You can have this 22-page e-booklet absolutely free.
[02:28:20.833 --> 02:28:25.037]  We'll also offer you a website with links to actual testimonials and product information.
[02:28:25.238 --> 02:28:27.400]  Could this fruit help you in your quest for total health?
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:35.467]  Find out why mangosteen is known as the queen of all fruit and why it's fast becoming the best-selling wellness product ever brought to the market.
[02:28:35.827 --> 02:28:37.309]  Your health is in your hands.
[02:28:37.589 --> 02:28:38.810]  Do something about it today.
[02:28:39.090 --> 02:28:39.330]  Call 800-658-0597.
[02:28:39.350 --> 02:28:39.731]  Again, that's 800-658-0597.
[02:28:46.954 --> 02:28:51.516]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:28:51.916 --> 02:28:54.858]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:28:55.178 --> 02:28:57.739]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:28:58.099 --> 02:29:02.921]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:29:03.301 --> 02:29:08.684]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:29:08.984 --> 02:29:11.945]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[02:29:12.125 --> 02:29:12.685]  We're good to go.
[02:29:35.533 --> 02:29:41.001]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:29:41.141 --> 02:29:41.441]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:29:47.961 --> 02:29:51.722]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[02:29:52.102 --> 02:29:59.424]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[02:29:59.844 --> 02:30:10.807]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:30:10.887 --> 02:30:11.347]  Central.
[02:30:11.707 --> 02:30:17.289]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[02:30:17.629 --> 02:30:23.532]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:30:24.033 --> 02:30:28.775]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[02:30:29.155 --> 02:30:33.938]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[02:30:34.378 --> 02:30:35.699]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[02:30:35.759 --> 02:30:36.179]  Central.
[02:30:36.759 --> 02:30:44.343]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[02:30:47.471 --> 02:31:13.372]  I can guarantee you that in your town or city, if it's of any size,
[02:31:14.549 --> 02:31:22.170]  You've got foreign companies coming in that have bought off your politicians and they're having the infrastructure handed over to them to rape the daylights out of you.
[02:31:22.210 --> 02:31:23.151]  This is out of the Statesman.
[02:31:24.871 --> 02:31:25.671]  5 to 8 p.m.
[02:31:25.771 --> 02:31:27.051]  Tuesday and Thursday.
[02:31:27.071 --> 02:31:35.073]  Now, by federal and state law, they're supposed to give you a 30-day notice of these public meetings where they then claim they're getting public input.
[02:31:35.993 --> 02:31:39.453]  But thousands literally show up to many of these meetings.
[02:31:39.553 --> 02:31:40.354]  Hundreds always do.
[02:31:40.394 --> 02:31:41.454]  They'll have a show of hands.
[02:31:41.514 --> 02:31:42.174]  It's always.
[02:31:42.554 --> 02:31:43.094]  I mean, they were like
[02:31:43.726 --> 02:31:48.029]  Twelve hundred people at one meeting and six people raise their hands and then people ask, who do you work for?
[02:31:48.290 --> 02:31:49.731]  They were all TxDOT employees.
[02:31:50.251 --> 02:31:51.632]  Texas Department of Transportation.
[02:31:52.653 --> 02:31:59.898]  So they're trying to announce this one day before the first meeting tomorrow in the hope that you won't show up.
[02:32:01.179 --> 02:32:06.484]  So call everybody you know and get down there unless you want Mopac to be run by Centro of Spain.
[02:32:07.684 --> 02:32:11.327]  Today, Tuesday at O'Henry Middle School at 2610 West 10th Street
[02:32:14.821 --> 02:32:27.051]  That's O'Henry Middle School tomorrow, 5 to 8 p.m., and Thursday at McCallum High School at 5600 Sunshine Drive.
[02:32:27.071 --> 02:32:30.854]  We have this up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:32:31.635 --> 02:32:33.436]  Now, that's 8,000 miles of roads in Texas.
[02:32:33.496 --> 02:32:38.240]  Now, again, we have the official map, and I would show people, this is TXDOT, do you see?
[02:32:38.260 --> 02:32:40.262]  14 toll roads!
[02:32:42.256 --> 02:32:42.817]  In Austin.
[02:32:43.137 --> 02:32:45.339]  Okay, that's every major road.
[02:32:46.399 --> 02:32:47.020]  Unbelievable.
[02:32:48.161 --> 02:32:49.062]  Let me think about it in my mind.
[02:32:49.102 --> 02:32:58.409]  Where I live, I couldn't go but, let me see, 350 yards east.
[02:33:00.771 --> 02:33:03.273]  I could go about a mile north.
[02:33:04.334 --> 02:33:05.615]  I could go about a mile
[02:33:07.254 --> 02:33:12.355]  West, and I could go about two miles south.
[02:33:13.355 --> 02:33:15.816]  Because I've seen the map and looked at it.
[02:33:17.356 --> 02:33:17.776]  Yeah.
[02:33:19.096 --> 02:33:20.056]  Without paying a toll.
[02:33:20.657 --> 02:33:22.677]  And I live on the edge of Austin.
[02:33:26.018 --> 02:33:31.399]  And I'm telling you, you read the Oak Hill Gazette that comes out every week, because I really live in Oak Hill.
[02:33:31.419 --> 02:33:33.099]  A little suburb.
[02:33:34.386 --> 02:33:36.208]  And it's just every week the cover.
[02:33:36.548 --> 02:33:41.452]  Oh, TxDot came in with a big lunch and oh, they say how wonderful the toll roads are.
[02:33:41.812 --> 02:33:43.213]  Oh, they spend so much time with us.
[02:33:43.253 --> 02:33:43.974]  They're so nice.
[02:33:45.034 --> 02:33:47.036]  They're a pack of criminal liars.
[02:33:48.817 --> 02:33:51.199]  I mean, I sit there and I read it every week and I just get mad.
[02:33:52.700 --> 02:33:54.001]  And it's the same thing everywhere.
[02:33:54.062 --> 02:33:55.042]  I mean, you heard Sal Costello.
[02:33:55.062 --> 02:33:55.783]  They just lie.
[02:33:55.803 --> 02:33:57.064]  They just lie and lie.
[02:33:58.692 --> 02:33:59.852]  They lie and say they're broke.
[02:33:59.912 --> 02:34:01.613]  They lie and say it's not a foreign company.
[02:34:01.893 --> 02:34:21.599]  They have the editor of the Austin Chronicle, who every week has articles for the toll roads, say Lewis Black, the pig that owns South by Southwest, he wrote in there that it's a conspiracy theory that it's Spanish owned.
[02:34:21.979 --> 02:34:23.680]  Folks, that's been in all the other papers.
[02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:24.360]  That's admitted.
[02:34:24.860 --> 02:34:26.140]  Sintra is of Spain.
[02:34:26.761 --> 02:34:27.641]  Of Madrid, Spain.
[02:34:29.341 --> 02:34:32.222]  I mean, again, they're so bold!
[02:34:33.582 --> 02:34:34.863]  They're just so bold!
[02:34:34.883 --> 02:34:39.164]  That was about a year and a half ago I saw that, and I literally almost fell out of my chair.
[02:34:40.664 --> 02:34:42.705]  No, Sentra is not fire known.
[02:34:42.745 --> 02:34:46.566]  That's another lie by the conspiracy theorist.
[02:34:49.227 --> 02:34:51.928]  Oh, and Alex Jones is so evil.
[02:34:58.685 --> 02:35:00.686]  And I've got all this other news.
[02:35:00.786 --> 02:35:01.726]  When does it end?
[02:35:01.826 --> 02:35:02.707]  When does it stop?
[02:35:03.167 --> 02:35:07.790]  What is the newest outrage and disgrace that we have to be put through?
[02:35:07.810 --> 02:35:09.191]  The next humiliation?
[02:35:10.652 --> 02:35:11.992]  I mean, this is only the start.
[02:35:15.795 --> 02:35:19.477]  You know, I've done two hours and 37 minutes and I haven't plugged my films yet.
[02:35:20.317 --> 02:35:21.618]  I want to go to your calls and cover news.
[02:35:21.638 --> 02:35:22.819]  I want to make it short and sweet.
[02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:26.401]  If you want to hear this radio show,
[02:35:28.763 --> 02:35:44.900]  And if you want to hear this radio show get more effective, and if you want to see newer films and more powerful films from me, and you want to see us write more articles and effect more change and fight for you, because we're fighting for ourselves, and we're all together on this, then you need to support us.
[02:35:47.163 --> 02:35:50.266]  And frankly, I don't like sitting here plugging my videos, and I don't like
[02:35:54.133 --> 02:35:58.334]  Sales pitches, and I frankly, more and more, might plug the videos once a day.
[02:35:58.634 --> 02:35:59.834]  I should be plugging them each hour.
[02:36:01.235 --> 02:36:05.416]  But I need, I don't like to spend all day trying to fuel my tank.
[02:36:06.596 --> 02:36:07.196]  And that's what it is.
[02:36:07.236 --> 02:36:14.218]  I'm a tank, and I run over New World Order lies and propaganda, and I run over their walls, and I gun them down in the ditches in the Info War.
[02:36:15.778 --> 02:36:21.660]  And so I'd rather not have a big discussion about it, just stick the fuel in my tank, and we can do more here.
[02:36:23.931 --> 02:36:25.892]  We can expand our organizational skills.
[02:36:26.693 --> 02:36:27.894]  We can move on to the next level.
[02:36:29.154 --> 02:36:31.356]  I want to thank you for all your support you have given us.
[02:36:32.997 --> 02:36:36.639]  Now, that normally is a secondary concern, and that's why it's become so secondary.
[02:36:36.659 --> 02:36:37.980]  I don't really promote stuff anymore.
[02:36:38.940 --> 02:36:39.341]  I should.
[02:36:39.361 --> 02:36:44.043]  But most of the time I just say, go watch my films for free on Google Video.
[02:36:44.083 --> 02:36:45.504]  That's a real good business tactic.
[02:36:45.785 --> 02:36:47.345]  But I don't care, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:47.446 --> 02:36:48.446]  I'm here to get the word out.
[02:36:48.746 --> 02:36:49.087]  Period.
[02:36:49.307 --> 02:36:51.108]  Not to put up with people's BS.
[02:36:52.313 --> 02:36:56.054]  And I've taken the gloves off in my life, I just don't care anymore.
[02:36:57.014 --> 02:37:05.957]  And that's what people in my personal lives, or people in the government, anywhere else, we're not playing games, we're not mincing words, we're not pulling punches, and every other cliché term you know for it.
[02:37:05.997 --> 02:37:11.458]  We're going full throttle, all or nothing, we're totally in, this is it.
[02:37:12.498 --> 02:37:14.379]  We recognize what the New World Order is.
[02:37:14.419 --> 02:37:18.540]  Let me tell you, to try to grasp who they are, to try to really face who they are,
[02:37:22.412 --> 02:37:25.694]  I mean, it's hard to get your brain even around how evil they are.
[02:37:26.475 --> 02:37:31.938]  How ruthless, just how... They stink!
[02:37:33.039 --> 02:37:36.441]  That old saying, you know, you just think, oh, you stink, or it stinks.
[02:37:36.481 --> 02:37:39.263]  I mean, think about it, it really stinks, like rotten flesh.
[02:37:39.283 --> 02:37:40.664]  That's what I mean when I say they stink.
[02:37:41.424 --> 02:37:42.525]  I mean, it stinks!
[02:37:42.965 --> 02:37:44.106]  These people stink!
[02:37:46.644 --> 02:37:47.825]  You know that control freak?
[02:37:47.845 --> 02:37:49.126]  You know that scumbag?
[02:37:49.146 --> 02:37:50.747]  You know that smiley person?
[02:37:50.787 --> 02:37:53.428]  You know that likes to manipulate people and hurt people?
[02:37:53.468 --> 02:37:54.129]  You know that person?
[02:37:54.349 --> 02:37:57.331]  These people are a thousand times worse than that and they run our lives.
[02:37:57.591 --> 02:37:59.072]  Yes, they're in control right now.
[02:37:59.772 --> 02:38:07.297]  And they're just, with their bravada, their chutzpah, their aplomb, they just keep barreling forward.
[02:38:09.918 --> 02:38:11.138]  And I'm not going to lay around.
[02:38:11.718 --> 02:38:16.519]  I'm not going to go to the relocation center with the Soviet model they got for this country.
[02:38:16.579 --> 02:38:19.300]  I'm not going to... I'm not going to lick your boots.
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:21.220]  I'm not going to go along with the system.
[02:38:22.121 --> 02:38:23.941]  And you shouldn't go along with it either.
[02:38:26.541 --> 02:38:29.862]  See, I start talking about my videos and I digress off into the New World Order.
[02:38:29.882 --> 02:38:31.222]  I just can't even stay focused on it.
[02:38:31.722 --> 02:38:34.163]  Number one, these are powerful films that you need to have.
[02:38:34.223 --> 02:38:36.603]  Not just the 15 I've made, but all the other books and videos we've carried.
[02:38:36.623 --> 02:38:37.824]  It's the best stuff out there we've found.
[02:38:38.304 --> 02:38:38.964]  That's number one.
[02:38:41.394 --> 02:38:54.917]  Terror Storm, American Freedom to Fascism, Loose Change 2nd Edition, Riddles in Stone about how these occultic nuts run everything, and how DC's laid out in a giant occult power center.
[02:38:55.718 --> 02:38:58.418]  Riddles in Stone, available at InfoWars.com, just came out.
[02:38:58.918 --> 02:39:01.459]  Go to the website, get them.
[02:39:01.479 --> 02:39:03.160]  Make copies of my films, you're authorized to.
[02:39:03.180 --> 02:39:04.860]  You're authorized to make copies of Russo's films.
[02:39:09.425 --> 02:39:10.866]  Uh, 9-11 Mysteries Demolitions.
[02:39:11.566 --> 02:39:11.986]  Excellent.
[02:39:13.527 --> 02:39:15.628]  I don't care if you already know about the New World Order.
[02:39:15.708 --> 02:39:16.588]  Get the videos.
[02:39:16.628 --> 02:39:17.288]  Make copies.
[02:39:17.648 --> 02:39:18.349]  Get them out to people.
[02:39:18.369 --> 02:39:19.149]  That's the whole point.
[02:39:19.449 --> 02:39:21.790]  You knowing about it, not doing anything, does nothing.
[02:39:25.472 --> 02:39:30.734]  And believe me, you may shoot your mouth off, or in your own mind, say, oh, they ever come to my house, I'll blow them away.
[02:39:32.294 --> 02:39:33.735]  Or this stuff keeps getting worse and worse.
[02:39:33.755 --> 02:39:34.655]  It's going to happen incrementally.
[02:39:35.055 --> 02:39:36.256]  You know, I'll do something then.
[02:39:37.003 --> 02:39:48.650]  Folks, if you haven't already gotten on the path to resistance, if you haven't already steeled yourself, if you haven't already gotten stoic about this and committed, I mean, I'm not what you'd call a cowardly person.
[02:39:49.610 --> 02:39:51.951]  I know this is serious.
[02:39:54.313 --> 02:39:55.694]  I'm like a lot of people in this movement.
[02:39:56.494 --> 02:39:58.495]  I have had to steel myself.
[02:39:59.856 --> 02:40:02.117]  I've had to look at what it is.
[02:40:02.177 --> 02:40:03.278]  I've had to face what it is.
[02:40:04.726 --> 02:40:06.186]  My subconscious has dealt with it.
[02:40:06.206 --> 02:40:07.327]  I've had plenty of dreams.
[02:40:08.627 --> 02:40:11.368]  Dreams that I doubt most people would ever imagine they'd have.
[02:40:12.408 --> 02:40:14.268]  Where my brain has gotten me ready for things.
[02:40:14.749 --> 02:40:16.189]  And that's what dreams are really all about.
[02:40:17.389 --> 02:40:19.570]  And I mean, I am ready, folks.
[02:40:19.790 --> 02:40:21.050]  I am 100% ready.
[02:40:21.350 --> 02:40:24.351]  Whether it's next month or 10 years from now, I weren't able to stop this thing.
[02:40:24.771 --> 02:40:25.851]  I don't want it to be violent.
[02:40:28.612 --> 02:40:29.632]  I don't want it to be violent.
[02:40:32.053 --> 02:40:32.593]  I really don't.
[02:40:35.985 --> 02:40:36.925]  I want to say this, too.
[02:40:38.825 --> 02:40:40.926]  There is so much beauty in the world.
[02:40:41.966 --> 02:40:43.947]  There is so much beauty in the world.
[02:40:44.807 --> 02:40:45.927]  I'm not a negative person.
[02:40:45.947 --> 02:40:47.968]  My God, I am surrounded by beauty.
[02:40:48.048 --> 02:40:49.408]  I'm surrounded by good things.
[02:40:50.048 --> 02:40:51.429]  I'm surrounded by blessings.
[02:40:53.930 --> 02:41:02.672]  I am just absolutely blessed and thankful and humbled by the amazing spectacle of life
[02:41:03.633 --> 02:41:06.835]  And just all the innocence, the innocence makes my heart melt.
[02:41:08.056 --> 02:41:16.441]  And I just cannot even fathom how these people, they see the strength that they're able to do really cold-hearted, bloodthirsty things, and I don't see the strength at all.
[02:41:17.061 --> 02:41:19.803]  I see as the ultimate of selfish and weak and bad.
[02:41:20.991 --> 02:41:22.672]  And of self-centered and greedy.
[02:41:22.712 --> 02:41:24.874]  These people are so greedy, they don't even want us to have a future.
[02:41:25.114 --> 02:41:26.475]  They don't want us to have our own minds.
[02:41:26.855 --> 02:41:35.602]  They revel in the fact that we're into... See, because they're all into being the smartest, and knowing everything, and being the enlightened ones, and the illumined ones, and you know, we're all a bunch of idiots.
[02:41:35.622 --> 02:41:39.545]  And yeah, the masses have always been dumbed down, on average, and always had their problems.
[02:41:39.865 --> 02:41:46.830]  But there's always been a large group of people that are intelligent, and dynamic, and happy, and the Renaissance men and women of our world.
[02:41:47.370 --> 02:41:48.470]  And the elite are not that.
[02:41:48.510 --> 02:41:58.372]  Let me tell you, Renaissance people do not try to stunt and dumb down and do that and consolidate and create.
[02:41:59.032 --> 02:42:02.713]  The New World Order always talks about free markets and trade and let the market do it.
[02:42:02.953 --> 02:42:04.533]  All they do is manipulate markets.
[02:42:04.573 --> 02:42:06.153]  All they do is consolidate markets.
[02:42:06.473 --> 02:42:08.574]  All they do is blow out economies by design.
[02:42:09.314 --> 02:42:11.694]  So they can rule from a giant trash heap.
[02:42:12.714 --> 02:42:15.855]  I was looking around at photos online last night and I saw this image.
[02:42:17.663 --> 02:42:24.526]  of a army soldier in Iraq, for some reason, in a landfill.
[02:42:24.566 --> 02:42:27.088]  And it was garbage all the way up to his waist.
[02:42:28.428 --> 02:42:31.730]  In the photos, a picture tells a thousand words.
[02:42:31.790 --> 02:42:33.951]  It's just, that's your empire.
[02:42:33.991 --> 02:42:35.732]  That's your empire of dirt, buddy.
[02:42:36.432 --> 02:42:37.112]  I mean, it just said it all.
[02:42:40.723 --> 02:42:42.605]  These guys are so into being manly.
[02:42:44.286 --> 02:42:48.890]  Manliness isn't just willing to go out and kill somebody or put yourself in harm's way.
[02:42:48.910 --> 02:42:54.454]  It's also having the willingness to do the things and stand up against things and tell the truth.
[02:42:58.737 --> 02:43:05.403]  And I just... I just can't believe...
[02:43:07.432 --> 02:43:13.613]  How diabolical, how far-reaching, how deep and pervasive this is.
[02:43:13.673 --> 02:43:26.396]  And how many shallow, selfish people there are serving the system who are these envious, greedy, competitive people.
[02:43:26.416 --> 02:43:28.177]  But they're not competitive in a real way.
[02:43:28.197 --> 02:43:29.437]  I'm not saying being competitive is bad.
[02:43:30.257 --> 02:43:30.937]  You know what I mean.
[02:43:30.997 --> 02:43:34.738]  It's like they're just... Man, I'm sick of them.
[02:43:36.388 --> 02:43:46.373]  And they love the system, and they just revel in all its totems, and its initiations, and all of its... I'm just sure to tell the elite, you are bankrupt.
[02:43:47.013 --> 02:43:50.195]  Let's say this is a top-down system, and somebody's got a rule.
[02:43:50.595 --> 02:43:51.796]  You are not fit to rule.
[02:43:52.316 --> 02:43:53.336]  You are bad stewards.
[02:43:53.356 --> 02:43:53.997]  You are scum.
[02:43:55.757 --> 02:43:55.998]  Okay?
[02:43:56.058 --> 02:43:58.779]  I mean, let's agree that it's survival of the fittest, which I don't agree with.
[02:44:00.905 --> 02:44:07.328]  And let's just say, you've got to have a global government to save us from bioweapons and super technologies, and that's why you've got to have a police state.
[02:44:07.988 --> 02:44:09.169]  Well, you're doing the opposite.
[02:44:11.770 --> 02:44:13.651]  You guys revel in bad stuff.
[02:44:15.032 --> 02:44:16.652]  It seems like you want to kill the planet.
[02:44:19.454 --> 02:44:26.277]  And then the people come to you wanting to do something about what's happening to the Earth, and you give them some false crises of carbon dioxide and a global tax to fix it.
[02:44:29.471 --> 02:44:30.372]  Alright, I've said enough.
[02:44:30.432 --> 02:44:31.332]  Let's just go to the calls.
[02:44:32.233 --> 02:44:36.596]  Brock in Canada, then Samuel, James, Ted, Richard and others.
[02:44:36.636 --> 02:44:36.957]  Go ahead.
[02:44:38.037 --> 02:44:38.698]  Hello Alex.
[02:44:39.038 --> 02:44:39.278]  Hi.
[02:44:40.119 --> 02:44:53.629]  I wanted to just mention real quick, I'd love to see George Bush, what's the word, I can't remember the word right now, impeached.
[02:44:54.178 --> 02:44:58.100]  For those two border guards, putting them in harm's way.
[02:44:58.460 --> 02:45:04.142]  What a scam and a filthy... He's supposed to look after American people, you know?
[02:45:04.242 --> 02:45:04.922]  Are you kidding?
[02:45:04.942 --> 02:45:06.563]  The government never looks after the police.
[02:45:06.583 --> 02:45:06.923]  I know.
[02:45:07.243 --> 02:45:10.265]  Police and soldiers, but they always lick their master's boot.
[02:45:11.145 --> 02:45:14.026]  They always thank them while they give them a shaft.
[02:45:14.086 --> 02:45:15.367]  Oh, thank you for all you do.
[02:45:15.547 --> 02:45:16.767]  Give me a deadly shot.
[02:45:17.027 --> 02:45:18.908]  Oh, government, you're America.
[02:45:19.468 --> 02:45:20.849]  The government isn't America.
[02:45:21.852 --> 02:45:22.052]  No.
[02:45:22.592 --> 02:45:24.853]  And I would have him impeached for that alone.
[02:45:24.933 --> 02:45:33.316]  And my question also is, what's Nancy Pelosi doing running around the world like some sort of ambassador?
[02:45:33.436 --> 02:45:36.217]  I don't understand what they're scamming there.
[02:45:36.778 --> 02:45:48.842]  And for those two border guards, if the people don't wake up and say, look, get him out of jail and put so much heat on the White House that they'll get him out just to stop the heat from coming their way.
[02:45:49.454 --> 02:45:50.595]  I mean, what a disgrace.
[02:45:51.075 --> 02:45:56.800]  What is Nancy Pelosi doing running around this place like she's some sort of wannabe president?
[02:45:57.721 --> 02:45:59.302]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[02:45:59.362 --> 02:46:01.964]  And then, of course, it came out that that's illegal.
[02:46:03.506 --> 02:46:05.507]  But then I said, well, they don't need to follow law.
[02:46:06.588 --> 02:46:09.851]  And then she's acting like she's on some type of diplomacy.
[02:46:10.899 --> 02:46:15.021]  Look, the Democrats just announced there's no plan to pull the troops out, even in two years.
[02:46:15.521 --> 02:46:18.463]  That's all smoke and mirrors to make the constituents think that.
[02:46:18.883 --> 02:46:20.904]  So at least they're still trying to keep up appearances.
[02:46:22.145 --> 02:46:27.327]  I heard a talk show host yesterday named Richard make a good point, Richard Reeves, that they are countering us.
[02:46:27.347 --> 02:46:32.269]  You know, the four stages that Gandhi talked about.
[02:46:32.389 --> 02:46:33.150]  First, they
[02:46:34.483 --> 02:46:37.646]  Ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[02:46:38.126 --> 02:46:43.110]  First they ignored us, then they laughed at us on 9-11 Truth, then they attacked us, next we win.
[02:46:45.412 --> 02:46:46.173]  Same thing on Kennedy.
[02:46:46.233 --> 02:46:48.215]  It's now publicly admitted the government killed Kennedy.
[02:46:49.055 --> 02:46:53.079]  And 90 plus percent know, I can't wait to see the new poll down at E. Howard Hunt with public.
[02:46:56.261 --> 02:46:58.563]  We already knew that, but the guy got photographed there.
[02:46:58.903 --> 02:47:00.585]  Dallas Times Herald, but I've already gone into that.
[02:47:03.135 --> 02:47:06.937]  And so, what's happening is, you know, they're having to put Dick Cheney on Rush Limbaugh.
[02:47:07.157 --> 02:47:07.758]  How do we help?
[02:47:07.778 --> 02:47:08.578]  How do we save you?
[02:47:08.618 --> 02:47:12.720]  How do we, you know, well, you move Halliburton to Dubai, that's how you do it, Rush.
[02:47:13.681 --> 02:47:14.581]  They're having to lobby.
[02:47:15.081 --> 02:47:17.983]  They're getting on TV going, the people all are going crazy!
[02:47:19.984 --> 02:47:21.725]  They're believing 9-11's an inside job.
[02:47:21.745 --> 02:47:22.305]  What's happened?
[02:47:22.845 --> 02:47:23.646]  It's a full moon!
[02:47:26.287 --> 02:47:27.348]  Wait till they learn
[02:47:29.893 --> 02:47:33.896]  Wait till they learn that the mercury did cause the giant increase in autism.
[02:47:33.916 --> 02:47:41.841]  Wait till they learn that the toll roads are foreign owned and that the Departments of Transportation had plenty of money when they figure out that we use more fuel than we ever used.
[02:47:42.222 --> 02:47:45.204]  From 15 million barrels to almost 25 million barrels in 10 years.
[02:47:46.565 --> 02:47:49.607]  Wait till people find out all the stuff you've lied about.
[02:47:50.074 --> 02:47:50.795]  Let me tell you something.
[02:47:51.455 --> 02:47:55.217]  The polls show 70 plus percent of the troops don't like the war and know it's a fraud.
[02:47:55.237 --> 02:47:56.438]  Let me tell you, it's a lot higher than that.
[02:47:56.998 --> 02:48:07.025]  I've talked to the Marines and the Army people, from privates, you know, up to master sergeants and up to colonels, and they will say, oh my God, yes, we know it's about money.
[02:48:07.085 --> 02:48:09.086]  Yes, we know it's a permanent base.
[02:48:09.166 --> 02:48:10.007]  Yes, we know.
[02:48:10.147 --> 02:48:11.067]  Yes, we know.
[02:48:11.648 --> 02:48:15.110]  Yes, we know Bush is a total traitor, and we wish he'd put us on the border.
[02:48:16.335 --> 02:48:17.476]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:48:17.997 --> 02:48:32.449]  The only people that don't know are these folks who aren't in the military, who drive around with all these stickers on their car, and maybe 20% of the troops who haven't been in the real combat zone yet, and haven't seen Halliburton getting $15 million for putting up a $100 blue tarp.
[02:48:33.370 --> 02:48:33.690]  Okay?
[02:48:34.431 --> 02:48:35.892]  Halliburton of Dubai, of course.
[02:48:36.532 --> 02:48:39.775]  Baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
[02:48:49.162 --> 02:48:54.629]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:55.010 --> 02:49:02.619]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.331 --> 02:49:10.373]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.774 --> 02:49:22.217]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.518 --> 02:49:26.079]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.479 --> 02:49:28.420]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.740 --> 02:49:32.581]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:16.099 --> 02:52:20.581]  But right now, let's talk to Samuel in Pennsylvania and then James, Todd and Richard.
[02:52:20.601 --> 02:52:21.201]  I'm going to move fast.
[02:52:21.241 --> 02:52:21.861]  Go ahead, Samuel.
[02:52:22.401 --> 02:52:23.302]  Alex, how are you today?
[02:52:23.362 --> 02:52:23.702]  Good, sir.
[02:52:24.022 --> 02:52:28.143]  We're facing the same problem with the Pennsylvania State Turnpike.
[02:52:28.383 --> 02:52:29.664]  The Pennsylvania Turnpike
[02:52:30.743 --> 02:52:41.053]  Is Governor Ed Rendell is trying to ram through legislation that would allow the lease of state assets to private companies.
[02:52:41.494 --> 02:52:47.279]  He's putting this on... And that's because the dollar is becoming like the ruble and so we're open to be bought up, folks.
[02:52:47.459 --> 02:52:49.862]  Well, they're putting it out there with this huge rush.
[02:52:49.902 --> 02:52:52.064]  As a matter of fact, on Forbes I sent Kevin
[02:52:52.552 --> 02:53:03.720]  And Aaron, a link to an article on Forbes, where Mary Peters, the United States Secretary of Transportation, is going around the country promoting these plans.
[02:53:03.981 --> 02:53:05.642]  She was in Pennsylvania last week.
[02:53:05.662 --> 02:53:07.603]  They had a state press conference.
[02:53:07.623 --> 02:53:07.963]  No, I know.
[02:53:08.023 --> 02:53:09.384]  Bush signed an executive order.
[02:53:09.425 --> 02:53:18.811]  The entire, the waterways, the water, the navigable straits, the roads, just everything, the power plants, anything government.
[02:53:19.092 --> 02:53:20.733]  And you look, I mean, take a lottery.
[02:53:21.213 --> 02:53:23.054]  That makes, say, a couple billion a year.
[02:53:23.114 --> 02:53:25.935]  Well, they sell it for what it makes in a year.
[02:53:25.955 --> 02:53:28.196]  You're not supposed to do... It'd be 20 times that.
[02:53:28.516 --> 02:53:31.257]  I mean, they're just... Look, it's not selling.
[02:53:31.697 --> 02:53:33.117]  The government's been paid off.
[02:53:33.157 --> 02:53:34.558]  They're handing everything over.
[02:53:36.047 --> 02:53:43.450]  And then we got a deal and now it's all going to be privately owned and they're cops, they're brain-dead cops that watch Jack Bauer all pushing us around.
[02:53:43.470 --> 02:53:45.651]  Thanks for the call, I gotta move on.
[02:53:45.671 --> 02:53:47.012]  Call me back tomorrow, we'll talk more about it.
[02:53:47.572 --> 02:53:49.413]  I know you're all great callers, I hate to cut you short.
[02:53:49.773 --> 02:53:51.033]  James in Canada, go ahead.
[02:53:51.494 --> 02:53:52.114]  Alex, hi.
[02:53:52.414 --> 02:53:52.554]  Hi.
[02:53:52.854 --> 02:53:55.095]  Question about Hurricane Katrina.
[02:53:55.115 --> 02:54:01.418]  I wonder, I just was looking into it, do you think that they really blew the levees up with explosives?
[02:54:02.734 --> 02:54:03.595]  I've never said they did.
[02:54:03.675 --> 02:54:07.197]  Police and other government people said they heard explosions.
[02:54:07.277 --> 02:54:08.458]  They blew it back in.
[02:54:09.238 --> 02:54:13.961]  The big flood they had 80-something years ago, publicly, and it flooded the poor areas of the ridge.
[02:54:14.341 --> 02:54:15.922]  And that's where that originally came from.
[02:54:16.202 --> 02:54:20.445]  But we do know that FEMA frustrated and blocked aid by design to make the disaster worse.
[02:54:20.725 --> 02:54:21.966]  They then claimed they needed more funding.
[02:54:22.286 --> 02:54:24.768]  Yeah, they blocked water from coming in, food from coming in.
[02:54:24.828 --> 02:54:29.511]  Even, I couldn't believe, Geraldo Rivera on Fox News was even crying, holding a baby.
[02:54:29.571 --> 02:54:31.292]  It was a piece of crap.
[02:54:32.202 --> 02:54:34.563]  A question, I just want to plug something.
[02:54:34.783 --> 02:54:37.044]  I set up a 9-11 Truth site in Calgary.
[02:54:37.084 --> 02:54:38.305]  Okay, give it out, give it out.
[02:54:38.325 --> 02:54:40.326]  Okay, it's calgary911truth.org.
[02:54:40.486 --> 02:54:40.886]  Check it out.
[02:54:41.547 --> 02:54:43.607]  Hope folks go to calgary911.org.
[02:54:43.648 --> 02:54:44.888]  Good call, thank you.
[02:54:45.388 --> 02:54:46.749]  Todd in Texas, go ahead.
[02:54:46.769 --> 02:55:00.335]  Hey Alex, I forgot to tell you yesterday, I'm doing a research paper on social studies influencing our children towards a one world government and I interviewed one of the ladies, one of the professors at Arizona State University in the Building North America program.
[02:55:00.576 --> 02:55:01.476]  She's aware of your work
[02:55:01.992 --> 02:55:05.474]  Uh, she recognized by name Bob Dacey's article, uh, Treason 101.
[02:55:05.754 --> 02:55:11.677]  They actually use your work in their classes to identify the media spin, uh, in their, in their program.
[02:55:12.837 --> 02:55:18.800]  So they're teaching it's good and they go, look at these demons, Bob Dacey and Alex Jones.
[02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:20.081]  Ooh, you're naughty.
[02:55:20.161 --> 02:55:20.401]  Yeah.
[02:55:20.421 --> 02:55:21.341]  They don't like it too much either.
[02:55:21.381 --> 02:55:22.362]  Very interesting lady.
[02:55:22.382 --> 02:55:22.582]  Very,
[02:55:23.123 --> 02:55:26.965]  Very, uh, very nice lady, but at the end, I asked her, why all the secrecy?
[02:55:27.266 --> 02:55:29.267]  Why are they, uh, having this evolution by stealth?
[02:55:29.587 --> 02:55:35.290]  And she said, well, it's because basically all the, you know, geniuses get so wrapped up in their work that they just don't have time to let the public know.
[02:55:35.310 --> 02:55:38.472]  Can you believe a person with a PhD gave me that trash?
[02:55:38.792 --> 02:55:39.293]  Unbelievable.
[02:55:39.493 --> 02:55:41.074]  Well, what you do is you show her...
[02:55:42.786 --> 02:55:45.688]  Minutes from last year, the Judicial Watch got what they said.
[02:55:45.768 --> 02:55:46.969]  First thing, keep it secret.
[02:55:47.209 --> 02:55:48.330]  But see, they even deny that.
[02:55:48.711 --> 02:55:49.731]  Oh no, it's not secret.
[02:55:49.751 --> 02:55:50.612]  It's just secret.
[02:55:51.313 --> 02:55:51.993]  Oh, they're crazy.
[02:55:52.013 --> 02:55:53.875]  They think it was the North American Union, but there is.
[02:55:53.935 --> 02:55:54.536]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:55.436 --> 02:55:56.217]  Richard in Texas.
[02:55:56.257 --> 02:55:56.777]  Last caller.
[02:55:56.818 --> 02:55:57.158]  Go ahead.
[02:55:57.856 --> 02:56:02.460]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to make mention of something that must be a common issue for a lot of your listeners.
[02:56:03.341 --> 02:56:14.071]  I came up in the insurance business and I've been out of that for a couple of years now and I just have a real difficulty trying to figure out industries out there that are not corrupt to try to figure out how to make a living anymore.
[02:56:15.192 --> 02:56:19.035]  I know people making pretty good livings mowing yards because a lot of folks won't hire the illegals now.
[02:56:19.756 --> 02:56:21.297]  I mean, that's what I'd go do probably.
[02:56:21.637 --> 02:56:22.838]  Hey, God bless y'all folks.
[02:56:22.878 --> 02:56:23.199]  Take care.
