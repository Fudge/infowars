[00:00:05.914 --> 00:00:10.115]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:11.576]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:13.236]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.896 --> 00:00:17.557]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.078 --> 00:00:22.179]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.393 --> 00:00:41.914]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:42.054 --> 00:00:42.514]  Welcome.
[00:00:42.594 --> 00:00:44.855]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:46.776]  It is now the second day of October 2007.
[00:00:47.556 --> 00:00:54.339]  We'll be live here for the next three hours with his once-a-month visit.
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:05.224]  We're going to have Michael Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com joining us to talk about the economy, the ongoing war drums that are intensifying by the day, by the week.
[00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:15.915]  And, of course, the unfolding police state, the attack on free speech going on from Burma to the United States to the UK.
[00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:19.197]  Mike Rivero joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:19.357 --> 00:01:25.801]  And then, Kurt Nemo will be joining us in the third hour.
[00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:27.543]  He is a prolific
[00:01:29.344 --> 00:01:45.858]  Online columnist, whose columns are picked up by hundreds of prominent websites, has a keen mind for deciphering political propaganda and, of course, hypocrisy, and is a staunch anti-New World Order fighter, 9-11 truther, anti-war.
[00:01:46.638 --> 00:01:49.961]  He'll be joining us in the third hour, and I'm really excited.
[00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:53.124]  I mentioned this yesterday that Kurt Nemo
[00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:04.511]  Is heading up and is the editor of my new website and it's TruthNews.us.
[00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:08.054]  We've got several other easy to remember domain names associated with it.
[00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:11.376]  But bottom line, it's TruthNews, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:14.088 --> 00:02:21.617]  And what we attempt to do there is to give you a clear picture of what's happening geopolitically across the planet and chronicle the New World Order's activities.
[00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:26.242]  We're going to be adding a lot of new functions very soon, a MySpace-type system to it.
[00:02:26.803 --> 00:02:30.407]  We've already got it linked to the PrisonPlanet.com message board.
[00:02:30.427 --> 00:02:31.788]  We're going to get it its own message board.
[00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.652]  The Nexus is in with the other message boards.
[00:02:35.382 --> 00:02:35.923]  I don't know.
[00:02:49.298 --> 00:02:59.783]  Also, I have a guest blogger area where people that have submitted articles to us and that show that they're not COINTELPRO or DESINFO and would like to have a place there on the site.
[00:03:00.423 --> 00:03:11.109]  We'll also have that on the news area of the site as well, but everyone will be able to have their own MySpace-type account on TruthNews.us.
[00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:13.870]  TruthNews.us, and I'm
[00:03:15.276 --> 00:03:33.187]  Really excited to have Kurt Nemo joining the InfoWars team here in the InfoWar, as we try to stop the Globalists from turning the planet into a planetary penitentiary, into a prison planet, into a global panopticon of surveillance and control.
[00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:43.633]  And so again, Kurt Nemo joining Paul Watson, Steve Watson, joining Aaron Dykes,
[00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:53.938]  Joining Ryan Slickheisen, joining Trey Kincaid, joining Mike Nelson, joining everyone.
[00:03:54.678 --> 00:04:02.944]  Weldon, Dwayne Coots, everybody who's part of this team.
[00:04:03.024 --> 00:04:04.566]  Wes, doing the IT work.
[00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:09.609]  Everybody that makes what we do on the internet possible.
[00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.731]  I'm just so proud of all of them.
[00:04:12.555 --> 00:04:16.278]  And the work that they do each day on the website.
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.062]  I've got quite a stack of news here in front of me.
[00:04:21.363 --> 00:04:28.729]  I want to go over, Bill Clinton gave a speech and he told NBC's Meet the Press, said something similar on Meet the Press.
[00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.770]  Got two different transcripts here.
[00:04:33.192 --> 00:04:38.497]  He told them that torture's a good thing.
[00:04:41.042 --> 00:04:42.443]  And this is a big development.
[00:04:43.224 --> 00:04:45.465]  On the other side, I'll break down why.
[00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:55.252]  And then we'll walk through the push for global taxation and social workers regulating our every action.
[00:04:56.453 --> 00:04:57.734]  It's all coming down, folks.
[00:04:57.794 --> 00:04:58.435]  It's all happening.
[00:05:01.724 --> 00:05:06.689]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.232]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:16.760]  Our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.123]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:05:20.423 --> 00:05:23.867]  So effective, you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:05:24.187 --> 00:05:33.532]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:37.294]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:05:37.534 --> 00:05:44.638]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[00:05:44.898 --> 00:05:46.260]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.00.
[00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:52.047]  Get two for $70.00 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:09.495]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:09.856 --> 00:06:17.466]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:25.241]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.621 --> 00:06:37.027]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.367 --> 00:06:40.929]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.571]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.591 --> 00:06:47.433]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:55.481]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:01.614 --> 00:07:08.778]  Hi, I'm David, and if you wake up at night to urinate like I was, then you'll want to take advantage of this special risk-free offer.
[00:07:08.998 --> 00:07:17.003]  If you have dribbling, burning, or pain during or after urination, then you may have a condition known as benign prostate enlargement.
[00:07:17.243 --> 00:07:19.925]  This is potentially serious and can get worse with age.
[00:07:20.345 --> 00:07:26.727]  So get regular checkups from your doctor and take advantage of this special risk-free offer on Beta Prostate.
[00:07:26.907 --> 00:07:31.429]  Beta Prostate contains natural ingredients that help support a healthy prostate.
[00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:37.090]  And it contains 3,000 times more beta-sinosterols than ordinary salt palmetto.
[00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.291]  So it's powerful and it works!
[00:07:39.671 --> 00:07:45.332]  What's better is that Beta Prostate is a healthy supplement, so you don't need a prescription for it, and it's risk-free.
[00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:48.633]  For your risk-free trial of Beta Prostate, call 1-800-894-3418.
[00:07:48.693 --> 00:07:48.893]  That's 1-800-894-3418.
[00:07:48.913 --> 00:07:49.853]  Try Beta Prostate risk-free.
[00:07:49.873 --> 00:07:50.093]  That's 1-800-894-3418.
[00:07:50.113 --> 00:07:52.334]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.553 --> 00:08:22.477]  Bill Clinton, torture like on 24, it's okay.
[00:08:24.078 --> 00:08:27.522]  It's one of the top stories right now on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:27.542 --> 00:08:40.554]  Paul Watson wrote the article for PrisonPlanet.com yesterday, but it's already moved down the page and into the news and focus section, and the easiest place to find it right now is InfoWars.com, and I had Slick Eisen
[00:08:42.246 --> 00:08:55.836]  Add to this some of the past related issues so you can actually hear the audio, read the memos, see John Yoo admitting that they torture children with pliers sexually.
[00:08:56.856 --> 00:09:02.801]  Because, I mean, I want it to fully burn in to your brains who these people are and what they do.
[00:09:04.082 --> 00:09:06.483]  Now this is unprecedented what's happened.
[00:09:06.503 --> 00:09:08.825]  This is huge what's happened.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.982]  And when Paul Watson learned of this yesterday, he was unable to find a video clip of it.
[00:09:14.502 --> 00:09:16.503]  It looks like it's now been uploaded.
[00:09:16.563 --> 00:09:19.604]  It's Bill Clinton on Meet the Press Sunday.
[00:09:19.664 --> 00:09:24.086]  He also reportedly gave a speech similarly a week ago, so it's a talking point.
[00:09:24.426 --> 00:09:37.172]  And we found that, and we found press reports on it, but we're right now combing through, it looks like a 20-minute interview on Meet the Press to find the specific actual clip.
[00:09:39.298 --> 00:09:43.363]  Bill Clinton, torture like on 24 is okay.
[00:09:43.803 --> 00:09:51.492]  Before I do that, let's play Laura Ingraham, an establishment hack who is there to neutralize conservatives.
[00:09:52.230 --> 00:10:00.417]  And ensure that they don't find out about the New World Order takeover, the North American Union, the end of the borders, the torture of the police state until it's too late.
[00:10:00.938 --> 00:10:17.132]  Here she is, on Fox, saying that it's a national referendum, because a make-believe little chicken-neck coward on television tortures people's children to get answers out of them, and so that means it's okay.
[00:10:17.172 --> 00:10:17.553]  Here it is.
[00:10:18.286 --> 00:10:22.369]  The average American out there loves the show 24, okay?
[00:10:22.609 --> 00:10:24.790]  They love Jack Bauer, they love 24.
[00:10:24.951 --> 00:10:33.096]  In my mind, that's as close to a national referendum that it's okay to use tough tactics against high-level Al-Qaeda operatives as we're gonna get, okay?
[00:10:36.438 --> 00:10:42.002]  High-level Al-Qaeda operatives, like a man who won't give a urine sample so they taser him ten times.
[00:10:42.998 --> 00:10:47.802]  Or a woman in a wheelchair who can't get out and the cop's dumb and tasers her till she dies.
[00:10:48.062 --> 00:10:49.223]  And these are all cases.
[00:10:50.344 --> 00:10:55.808]  Or a pro-life demonstrator who won't get up off a sidewalk so they break their arms with nunchucks.
[00:10:55.948 --> 00:11:02.774]  We have a video of that up and YouTube decided to flag it for indecency and you have to register to watch it.
[00:11:03.234 --> 00:11:05.616]  But there's a bug in the YouTube system if you just go to
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:13.285]  PrisonPlanet.com and in the News in Focus you go to the headline about security guards break girl's arm for dropping cake.
[00:11:13.685 --> 00:11:22.131]  At the bottom of that story you can watch police with the nunchucks from Chicago to LA breaking arms.
[00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:27.355]  I mean you can watch them twist and they say get up, person says no, they go alright and they BAM break it.
[00:11:28.035 --> 00:11:32.018]  You can, that's torture, that's Abu Ghraib torture.
[00:11:32.702 --> 00:11:40.424]  And it's been going on for 20 years in this nation, and it destroys the name of this country.
[00:11:40.504 --> 00:11:43.425]  It destroys the uniform.
[00:11:43.505 --> 00:11:44.506]  It destroys it all.
[00:11:44.566 --> 00:11:48.447]  I mean, why would we want to bathe in this type of evil and then defend it?
[00:11:51.128 --> 00:11:53.409]  In fact, John, I know I didn't give you a heads up on this.
[00:11:53.449 --> 00:11:57.570]  Will you go find, I know it's been about six months since we played it, the John Yoo
[00:11:58.462 --> 00:12:02.784]  Clip where he admits, he says, yes, the President can order children tortured with pliers?
[00:12:04.465 --> 00:12:13.289]  If not, it's, you go to Infowars.com, uh, and go to the headline story that says, Bill Clinton, torture like on 24 is okay.
[00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:16.250]  America needs more Jack Bauer-like agents, says former President.
[00:12:16.651 --> 00:12:25.895]  You can, uh, Bush Advisor says he has legal power to torture children, and he admits it in there, there's an audio, there's a video where you admit it.
[00:12:26.644 --> 00:12:27.444]  Everybody boos.
[00:12:27.464 --> 00:12:28.845]  He goes, yeah, the President can do that.
[00:12:30.906 --> 00:12:35.008]  So, uh, that's right there for everybody who wants to see this.
[00:12:35.028 --> 00:12:38.129]  Because I know a normal person hears this and they're like, oh, come on.
[00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:48.794]  The Council to the President didn't write memos to the President and to the Pentagon saying we can torture children, small children, with pliers.
[00:12:48.854 --> 00:12:49.855]  And I'm not going to mention how.
[00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:51.196]  You can go read what he said.
[00:12:52.436 --> 00:12:53.216]  That's not true.
[00:12:53.236 --> 00:12:54.217]  Okay, well.
[00:12:54.984 --> 00:12:58.145]  You can go watch John Yoo video where he says it.
[00:12:58.725 --> 00:13:01.766]  You can go listen to audio recorded at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:13:02.106 --> 00:13:09.107]  It's so upset even CFR members, New World Order minions, that they went public.
[00:13:09.147 --> 00:13:19.510]  And we interviewed Professor Castle, one of the top professors in the country, on jurisprudence and law, constitutional law, who was there.
[00:13:20.795 --> 00:13:23.958]  And they won't say who recorded it, because you're not allowed to.
[00:13:24.018 --> 00:13:25.579]  It's a civil violation to record.
[00:13:25.599 --> 00:13:32.525]  NCFR members, you sign a civil agreement that you're liable if you record, but several people secretly recorded it.
[00:13:32.925 --> 00:13:33.926]  I'm not going to say who.
[00:13:34.307 --> 00:13:41.573]  But it doesn't matter, because you later just admits it, when he was down in Houston speaking at a university.
[00:13:43.755 --> 00:13:45.076]  But here's the big news.
[00:13:49.731 --> 00:13:59.925]  In 2001 and 2002, the CIA Section Chief for the Middle East told the Washington Post in November of 2001, he said,
[00:14:06.411 --> 00:14:14.100]  Yes, we are torturing people in client nations, third-party nations, but we're overseeing it in Jordan, in Egypt, in Eastern Europe.
[00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:15.482]  That later all came out.
[00:14:15.722 --> 00:14:20.248]  But this was back when they thought, because they'd staged the terror attack, that the public would buy anything.
[00:14:20.348 --> 00:14:22.130]  I'm giving you some background, then I'll get into Clinton.
[00:14:25.157 --> 00:14:28.498]  And he said, we also torture their children.
[00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.499]  And I put that in 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:14:30.539 --> 00:14:37.522]  That Washington Post article is in the first 9-11 film ever put out, which is my film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:14:39.823 --> 00:14:41.023]  And we have that article.
[00:14:42.044 --> 00:14:42.864]  And we show it to you.
[00:14:43.044 --> 00:14:47.206]  And we highlight the area where he says we torture children in front of their parents.
[00:14:48.835 --> 00:15:12.286]  Now, we later learned that they were already doing that, and then in late 2002, these memos were written by then-head Presidential Counsel Alberto Gonzalez and his deputy, Deputy Chief Counsel to the President, John Yoo, the Pentagon said, okay, well give us specifics on what we're supposed to do.
[00:15:12.326 --> 00:15:15.548]  And he said, well, you use pliers on the children's sexual organs.
[00:15:16.288 --> 00:15:17.589]  And they said, yes, sir.
[00:15:20.402 --> 00:15:31.573]  So, and then we got the General Tagumba report, the Army report, out of Abu Ghraib and 30 plus other camps, and it had degenerated into things even worse.
[00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:38.380]  Raping the children in front of their parents, raping the wives, raping them with acid.
[00:15:41.903 --> 00:15:44.324]  Now, I don't know who could defend that.
[00:15:44.384 --> 00:15:46.606]  I mean, we're talking hostile type.
[00:15:46.646 --> 00:15:49.487]  I haven't seen hostile one or two, but I've read the reviews.
[00:15:49.527 --> 00:15:50.628]  Whipping eyeballs out.
[00:15:51.608 --> 00:15:52.669]  Raping people.
[00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:54.930]  Acid.
[00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.591]  That's what our government does.
[00:15:57.651 --> 00:16:02.094]  I mean, actual Joseph Mingula type things.
[00:16:06.516 --> 00:16:07.937]  And in Nazi Germany,
[00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:20.726]  The troops and the police, a lot of them didn't like Hitler, but they said, well, we've got to follow orders, well, we can't, we've got to stick together, and then by the end they said, oh my gosh, what have we done, we've got to say no to this.
[00:16:21.327 --> 00:16:33.892]  And if you're making excuses right now for this, and if you're rationalizing, or you're just saying I'm lying without checking it out, you have now wantonly gone into evil, and you've become an accessory to all of this.
[00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:42.194]  And not just under international or national or state law, you become an accessory spiritually.
[00:16:43.255 --> 00:16:44.256]  That's what really counts.
[00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:46.737]  You become an accessory in your soul.
[00:16:47.178 --> 00:16:52.121]  You have now made a deal with the devil, whether you want to recognize that or not.
[00:16:52.181 --> 00:16:55.644]  You are now baptized, reborn in hell.
[00:16:57.245 --> 00:17:00.908]  You have now joined the host of Hades.
[00:17:02.685 --> 00:17:12.729]  You have pledged yourself a son, a daughter of darkness and pain and absolute abject wickedness, torturing and rending small children.
[00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:16.410]  You have now entered into the very pit of hell.
[00:17:18.751 --> 00:17:24.553]  Now, I remember in 2002, I was flown out to LA to tape a couple of episodes of The Conspiracy Zone.
[00:17:26.974 --> 00:17:30.856]  I forget for what cable channel it was, one of those.
[00:17:35.131 --> 00:17:43.793]  I was out there, and I remember sitting around waiting for a day to go do the filming, and so I was watching a bunch of military briefings in C-SPAN.
[00:17:44.513 --> 00:17:53.295]  And I'll never forget trying to scramble and call some of my staff, some of my crew colleagues to record it, and they weren't there or something.
[00:17:54.195 --> 00:17:58.836]  Because I was watching Rumsfeld just say, yeah, we took the gloves off, we're getting rough with them.
[00:17:59.836 --> 00:18:02.377]  We don't call it torture, but yeah, we get rough with them.
[00:18:03.115 --> 00:18:04.816]  See, we don't call it torture.
[00:18:04.836 --> 00:18:06.337]  It's all lawyer-ese.
[00:18:09.259 --> 00:18:19.545]  Oh, we just pressure people, and then the Gonzales memos that are declassified in public say, well, we can beat somebody or torture them until they die, and we didn't mean to kill them.
[00:18:19.905 --> 00:18:20.826]  It's not even torture.
[00:18:21.206 --> 00:18:23.828]  Killing people isn't torture.
[00:18:25.268 --> 00:18:30.971]  And I love these little word games that these neocons and people play with this.
[00:18:31.051 --> 00:18:37.053]  But we never had the president come out or a former president come out and endorse it.
[00:18:37.113 --> 00:18:44.777]  Now, one time I was on a... I guess 24 So Popular with what?
[00:18:45.037 --> 00:18:46.978]  Something like 40 million viewers a week or something.
[00:18:48.018 --> 00:18:49.179]  But I've been on two different flights.
[00:18:49.279 --> 00:18:51.720]  Once to LA and then once to England.
[00:18:52.944 --> 00:18:56.067]  And on the flight to England, I probably watched nine hours of it.
[00:18:56.907 --> 00:19:03.132]  The guy was sitting right in front of me, catty corner, with a big screen computer open, with the audio on.
[00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:20.406]  And so I got to sit there and watch nine episodes or so of it, and I have to tell you that it gave me such bad motion sickness after the fact, because then if you look at one spot when you're in motion, you know, that means the little hairs inside your
[00:19:22.146 --> 00:19:34.369]  I don't usually get motion sickness, but when I got off that plane after nine, ten hours of watching television, I was stumbling around for a day, but I already digress.
[00:19:35.769 --> 00:19:40.350]  In those nine episodes or so I watched, they tortured a couple children in front of their parents.
[00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.670]  It was torture every episode.
[00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:46.551]  And so we'll talk about Bill Clinton endorsing the most hardcore forms of torture.
[00:19:48.972 --> 00:19:50.772]  And we'll talk about how we're going to end up having
[00:19:51.572 --> 00:19:52.274]  A dynasty!
[00:19:52.575 --> 00:19:53.779]  We'll be right back.

[00:21:14.866 --> 00:21:20.988]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:21:21.028 --> 00:21:25.409]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing Yan revolution.
[00:21:25.769 --> 00:21:34.412]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:21:34.452 --> 00:21:37.113]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:21:37.393 --> 00:21:41.335]  Russia, Switzerland and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:21:41.535 --> 00:21:48.077]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[00:23:49.025 --> 00:23:49.325]  That's 1-800-875-4254.
[00:24:01.154 --> 00:24:03.075]  Now, 24 is a very important broadcast.
[00:24:03.095 --> 00:24:07.358]  A very important show of the New World Order.
[00:24:07.738 --> 00:24:09.279]  And they have literally
[00:24:25.609 --> 00:24:27.511]  It's got to be 15 or 20 spinoffs.
[00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:29.313]  They've got 4 or 5 shows in England.
[00:24:30.655 --> 00:24:32.517]  They have several going at any one time.
[00:24:32.577 --> 00:24:35.340]  They've had more than 10 here in the U.S.
[00:24:36.081 --> 00:24:39.205]  CSI Miami, CSI, all these other shows.
[00:24:39.938 --> 00:24:44.762]  Where there's torture almost every episode because I read the different synopses that get sent in.
[00:24:45.122 --> 00:24:51.066]  People send me links, you know, to the actual ABC, CBS, NBC's shows where they give the synopsis of tonight.
[00:24:51.167 --> 00:24:55.530]  Torture gets the answers and keeps America safe when a nuke's gonna go off.
[00:24:56.371 --> 00:25:02.055]  Tonight on 24, the child of the terrorist is tortured and it saves them from an anthrax attack.
[00:25:04.654 --> 00:25:07.677]  Now, of course there's not any real terrorists in the U.S.
[00:25:07.997 --> 00:25:12.560]  If there were, imagine in what case actual torture would really save somebody.
[00:25:14.442 --> 00:25:21.568]  History shows that torture is good for fake confessions and good for government terrorism and terrorizing the population.
[00:25:22.128 --> 00:25:25.811]  This is the Army's own handbooks, written on it back in the 60s, say it's horrible, doesn't work.
[00:25:27.473 --> 00:25:33.918]  Letting people go, giving them big amounts of cash, saying we'll help your children get into a good college,
[00:25:34.711 --> 00:25:35.472]  That's what works.
[00:25:35.692 --> 00:25:37.154]  But I digress.
[00:25:40.558 --> 00:25:45.825]  The Mingela stuff is where it's gone, though.
[00:25:45.865 --> 00:25:47.927]  I mean, they didn't just start out with, hey, we're going to rough folks up.
[00:25:47.947 --> 00:25:49.289]  They just said, hey, we're going to torture children.
[00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:53.074]  And America said, yeah, all right, yeah.
[00:25:54.329 --> 00:26:04.937]  And then the thousands of photos and videos got to Congress of Abu Ghraib, so CBF decided to release a few dozen of the stuff they could say was, oh, naked pyramids and punching people.
[00:26:06.178 --> 00:26:12.622]  And then Congress admits, no, it's children being raped, it's women being raped, it's stuff we can't even speak, it's snuff films.
[00:26:13.783 --> 00:26:20.088]  And then a few photos of dead guys got released, and the neocons said, oh, beat them to death, that's how you get tough, big deal.
[00:26:21.068 --> 00:26:22.109]  And then the Army admitted that 95%
[00:26:24.145 --> 00:26:30.690]  Of those, this is in the Army's own reports, that were at the different camps, were picked up at checkpoints for no reason.
[00:26:32.151 --> 00:26:35.653]  But you gotta be tortured first, to make sure you're not with Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:36.033 --> 00:26:39.896]  Now of course the Pentagon knew that would create real resistance, and that was the plan.
[00:26:39.956 --> 00:26:47.081]  Create a resistance, torture people, keep the water, keep the power off, cause a huge resistance, disband the military immediately,
[00:26:48.763 --> 00:26:52.084]  To break it in three parts, and to destroy the nation forever.
[00:26:52.245 --> 00:26:53.985]  The Pentagon said so in P-2-O-G.
[00:26:54.305 --> 00:27:01.228]  But the grunts out there, they believe the public propaganda, and the Limbaugh propaganda, and the Hillary propaganda about why they're over there.
[00:27:02.929 --> 00:27:07.531]  And it's so diabolical that the average person just can't believe people think like that.
[00:27:07.771 --> 00:27:11.132]  Hey, they write memos saying, sexually torture children.
[00:27:14.234 --> 00:27:14.874]  You understand?
[00:27:15.674 --> 00:27:17.335]  These are hardcore demons.
[00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:39.980]  So they admitted all the torture, and then it got unpopular, and they said, we never said that, and they prosecuted a few low-level people that followed their orders, and one private contractor in Afghanistan who tortured people to death, they charged him, and then he spoke out to the media, so they arrested him as a terrorist under the Patriot Act, and he's never been seen since, and he doesn't get a trial.
[00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.792]  Oh yeah, that was in the news.
[00:27:44.092 --> 00:27:45.373]  Oh, you're one of our torturers!
[00:27:45.413 --> 00:27:47.994]  You're going to say, what general gave the orders?
[00:27:48.014 --> 00:27:49.676]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:27:50.056 --> 00:27:52.077]  So, torturers should know that too.
[00:27:52.718 --> 00:27:54.079]  You like to kill people, huh?
[00:27:54.119 --> 00:27:55.379]  You like to rape children.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.141]  You like to rape and beat women.
[00:27:57.221 --> 00:27:57.961]  It's what you're into.
[00:27:58.382 --> 00:28:00.423]  You go and you join, you're a contractor, you do it.
[00:28:01.424 --> 00:28:09.169]  If you get caught, or if somebody blows the whistle on you, they're going to arrest you and put you in a secret military cell.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.281]  See, that's part of how this works now.
[00:28:14.722 --> 00:28:16.283]  You're gonna go to a black site.
[00:28:16.703 --> 00:28:17.583]  A ghost site.
[00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:22.966]  Folks, we're not joking about this.
[00:28:23.306 --> 00:28:33.551]  And they're appointing, by the way, nothing but hardcore Eastern European immigrants to head up Homeland Security, everything else, the Attorney General's ship, you name it.
[00:28:33.611 --> 00:28:34.712]  Folks, we're in trouble.
[00:28:36.973 --> 00:28:38.714]  Okay, we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:28:39.793 --> 00:28:46.397]  And then Bill Clinton comes out and says, I like torture, it's good.
[00:28:46.977 --> 00:28:50.439]  Exact quotes, Bill Clinton, torture like on 24 is okay.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:29:00.504]  Former President Clinton has told NBC's Meet the Press, and then Paul has a link to Mainstream News.
[00:29:01.165 --> 00:29:04.106]  Let me just go to the story, see what link that is.
[00:29:04.166 --> 00:29:05.387]  I forget, I looked at it earlier.
[00:29:06.848 --> 00:29:08.989]  Here it is, let me go to the actual link.
[00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:12.610]  New York Daily News ran with it originally.
[00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:14.391]  This is New York Daily News' headline.
[00:29:14.692 --> 00:29:18.014]  Torture like Jack Bauer would be okay, Bill Clinton says.
[00:29:18.034 --> 00:29:21.376]  Because I know neocons are driving along, and they'll just say I made that up.
[00:29:22.456 --> 00:29:24.057]  Or maybe if they saw it, they'll say it's good.
[00:29:24.097 --> 00:29:24.918]  Well, they'll double think.
[00:29:25.118 --> 00:29:28.920]  They'll say it's not real, but it's true, and it's good, and I'm a commie.
[00:29:29.521 --> 00:29:31.242]  But I'm not a Trotskyite neocon.
[00:29:31.442 --> 00:29:35.845]  But Trotskyite neocons are good, because Trotsky was good, but communism was bad.
[00:29:36.445 --> 00:29:39.647]  And there's no new world order, but we need a new world order to fight Al Qaeda.
[00:29:43.224 --> 00:29:45.888]  And the NRA's good even though they're for every major gun control bill.
[00:29:47.571 --> 00:29:48.753]  Because I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[00:29:51.937 --> 00:29:52.879]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.942]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.962 --> 00:29:58.567]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.829 --> 00:30:04.770]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:10.111]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:30:10.451 --> 00:30:15.732]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:16.192 --> 00:30:17.293]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:17.653 --> 00:30:26.655]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.780]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:10.602]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:31:10.882 --> 00:31:19.064]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:31:19.264 --> 00:31:25.065]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:31:25.185 --> 00:31:26.926]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:31:27.026 --> 00:31:29.146]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:31:29.306 --> 00:31:33.551]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:31:33.731 --> 00:31:35.874]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:31:35.954 --> 00:31:43.743]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:31:44.304 --> 00:31:44.624]  I think so.
[00:32:08.112 --> 00:32:08.372]  Hemp.
[00:32:08.792 --> 00:32:11.533]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[00:32:11.893 --> 00:32:12.193]  Hemp.
[00:32:12.533 --> 00:32:18.995]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:32:19.335 --> 00:32:22.596]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[00:32:22.856 --> 00:32:26.477]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[00:32:27.057 --> 00:32:31.380]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments.

[00:32:38.484 --> 00:32:42.767]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[00:32:42.987 --> 00:32:44.848]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?

[00:33:21.736 --> 00:33:24.717]  Imagine, the land of the free, the home of the brave.
[00:33:26.417 --> 00:33:31.739]  With every major cop show, every major CIA spook show, there are new heroes.
[00:33:32.279 --> 00:33:36.480]  Doubling the size of the CIA, huge recruiting centers everywhere.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:42.622]  Little wannabe Jack Bowers, and you know they're setting it up, domestically.
[00:33:42.662 --> 00:33:43.922]  If you don't, go check it out.
[00:33:44.842 --> 00:33:47.923]  Threat integration, FEMA command centers in every major city.
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:34:01.171]  The FBI going out and saying, oh, come to our recruiting centers, come to our local event centers, sign up as tattletales to watch your neighbors to fight terror and crime.
[00:34:01.191 --> 00:34:05.675]  And there's going to be CIA liaison officers in every city.
[00:34:06.997 --> 00:34:10.420]  And now all crime under Section 802 is terror.
[00:34:12.148 --> 00:34:17.369]  With 25 year old CIA case officers getting their hands on you.
[00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:19.089]  Gettin' the power drills out.
[00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:21.250]  Gettin' the pliers out.
[00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:23.050]  Rippin' some teeth out.
[00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:24.630]  Grillin' some kneecaps.
[00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.250]  Rapin' some people.
[00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:27.271]  Gettin' some acid.
[00:34:27.611 --> 00:34:29.371]  Gettin' some waterboardin' goin'.
[00:34:29.831 --> 00:34:32.332]  They always wanted to be psychopathic killers.
[00:34:32.692 --> 00:34:35.012]  And they played video games the last 10 years.
[00:34:35.052 --> 00:34:35.992]  Rippin' guts out.
[00:34:36.292 --> 00:34:38.033]  Torturing, raping prostitutes.
[00:34:38.393 --> 00:34:40.533]  And Grand Theft Auto for bonus cash.
[00:34:41.293 --> 00:34:43.874]  And now they're actually going to do it in the real world.
[00:34:44.274 --> 00:34:46.735]  Led by hardcore commissariats.
[00:34:47.256 --> 00:34:49.596]  Led by hardcore killers.
[00:34:50.577 --> 00:34:54.018]  Oh, it's so good to be part of the New World Order.
[00:34:54.038 --> 00:34:55.399]  To take what they want.
[00:34:55.539 --> 00:34:56.399]  To rule!
[00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:57.540]  To dominate!
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.920]  To control!
[00:35:00.001 --> 00:35:01.401]  And you think the left cares?
[00:35:01.721 --> 00:35:08.144]  As soon as Hillary Clinton's in, they're going to howl and scream with wanton abandon and pleasure.
[00:35:10.456 --> 00:35:15.499]  The border's falling, national socialized health care they micromanage and run your whole life.
[00:35:16.139 --> 00:35:20.541]  Huge socialist programs for the big central banks all over the planet.
[00:35:20.841 --> 00:35:25.364]  New carbon taxes, anti-human taxes to control your everyday life.
[00:35:25.724 --> 00:35:32.087]  New hordes of bureaucracies being erected to micromanage and track and control everything you do.
[00:35:33.007 --> 00:35:35.929]  It's now here, it's now rising against you.
[00:35:36.449 --> 00:35:39.871]  Armies of young scum who won't have jobs,
[00:35:40.755 --> 00:35:50.002]  In IT, or in factories, or in farming, they're gonna have jobs wearing suits and black uniforms with pliers jerking your front teeth out!
[00:35:50.763 --> 00:35:52.184]  That's the new America!
[00:35:52.965 --> 00:35:58.489]  You go to AIM, you go to UT, you're out here in Texas, the biggest, largest,
[00:35:59.711 --> 00:36:07.294]  Of the grants and scholarships being given are for spying and tracking and secret agenting all domestically.
[00:36:07.535 --> 00:36:11.936]  Hordes of power-tripping scum everywhere ruling over us!
[00:36:13.737 --> 00:36:18.779]  Now, I am trying to get your attention because that's what we're talking about here, my friends.
[00:36:18.819 --> 00:36:20.040]  That's what we're dealing with.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:26.763]  Let me just read you this article and go over this because this is the President of the United States trying to seduce you into evil.
[00:36:29.895 --> 00:36:33.236]  Bill Clinton, torture like on 24 is okay.
[00:36:34.597 --> 00:36:38.218]  America needs more Jack Bauer-like agents, says former president.
[00:36:38.498 --> 00:36:42.639]  By the way, did Trey find that in that 20-minute clip we found of Meet the Press?
[00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:43.360]  Do you have that yet?
[00:36:46.361 --> 00:36:47.481]  No, no, no.
[00:36:47.581 --> 00:36:50.282]  He sent you the two-minute clip.
[00:36:50.622 --> 00:36:52.443]  I don't have time to confer and do all this, folks.
[00:36:52.523 --> 00:36:54.643]  It all moves too fast, so we just do it live on air.
[00:36:55.124 --> 00:36:59.325]  The two-minute clip you were sent, is it the one that says dynasty on it?
[00:37:00.538 --> 00:37:02.019]  No, that's a wrong clip.
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:07.304]  That's a clip I want to play where he talks about how it's not a dynasty to have only Bushes and Clintons running things.
[00:37:09.666 --> 00:37:13.909]  Just go to YouTube and type in Bill Clinton meet the press.
[00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:16.451]  And then click date added.
[00:37:18.453 --> 00:37:22.336]  Or Bill Clinton meet the press torture, Bill Clinton meet the press Jack Bauer, John.
[00:37:22.916 --> 00:37:25.739]  And then hit date added and that'll give you this last Sunday.
[00:37:26.839 --> 00:37:27.340]  Two days ago.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.161]  All right, let me just get back to this.
[00:37:33.062 --> 00:37:48.074]  Former President Bill Clinton has told NBC's Meet the Press that America needs more intelligence agents who make their own rules, and engage in whatever actions are necessary, like Jack Bauer from the fictional TV show 24.
[00:37:50.756 --> 00:37:58.141]  I think what our policy ought to be is to be uncompromisingly opposed to terror, I mean, to torture.
[00:37:59.773 --> 00:38:12.282]  You're the Jack Bauer person, you do whatever you do, and you should be prepared to take the consequences, and I think the consequences will be imposed based on what turns out to be the truth Clinton said.
[00:38:12.582 --> 00:38:14.803]  Coming from you, you'll give us the truth, right, Clinton?
[00:38:15.064 --> 00:38:17.105]  Mr. Truth is your name, just like George Bush.
[00:38:21.548 --> 00:38:28.713]  I mean, just that paragraph, the twisting, the lying, the evil deception by a master of evil.
[00:38:33.223 --> 00:38:36.124]  Do whatever they want, uncompromisingly.
[00:38:39.105 --> 00:38:41.365]  And I think the policy should be.
[00:38:42.686 --> 00:38:45.067]  See, it's all about policy.
[00:38:46.427 --> 00:38:55.210]  Not the Bill of Rights, not the Constitution, just, hey, we're the secret police, we have a policy, we have a memo saying we torture toddlers.
[00:38:58.531 --> 00:39:01.372]  We have a memo saying we rape people's wives in front of them.
[00:39:01.812 --> 00:39:02.812]  We have a memo.
[00:39:04.384 --> 00:39:12.871]  Oh no, people that write memos and torture children, they wouldn't kill 2,800 Americans on 9-11.
[00:39:12.891 --> 00:39:14.072]  No, they're nice.
[00:39:14.453 --> 00:39:15.994]  They care about all of us.
[00:39:16.254 --> 00:39:24.981]  They want us to have good lives, and they wouldn't hurt our dollar, and they wouldn't destroy our sovereignty, and the Federal Reserve cares about us!
[00:39:25.602 --> 00:39:27.203]  They're not hardcore killers!
[00:39:27.463 --> 00:39:29.085]  They're not hardcore predators!
[00:39:30.459 --> 00:39:36.123]  They just write memos saying that they want to sterilize and exterminate 80% of the population publicly.
[00:39:38.265 --> 00:39:45.450]  Dick Cheney just writes memos saying he wants to have race-specific bioweapons legitimized so that they can use them until certain races.
[00:39:47.971 --> 00:39:49.312]  They're nice people.
[00:39:49.332 --> 00:39:52.495]  And then I get that stupid question over and over and over again.
[00:39:53.075 --> 00:39:57.158]  It's not a stupid question, it's stupid that it's been asked so many times and that you don't understand the answer.
[00:39:57.558 --> 00:39:58.599]  Why am I still alive?
[00:39:59.525 --> 00:40:01.565]  Number one, by the good graces of God.
[00:40:03.326 --> 00:40:04.406]  And I'm in God's hands.
[00:40:04.606 --> 00:40:06.626]  My destiny is controlled by the creator of the universe.
[00:40:08.907 --> 00:40:17.308]  B, if they strike me down, if they kill me, it will make me a martyr and will only make people look more at what I've said and done.
[00:40:17.328 --> 00:40:28.230]  Now, that doesn't mean that I don't have to be as wise as a serpent and peaceful as a dove, and if I ask for it,
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.120]  I think?
[00:40:52.012 --> 00:40:53.772]  They don't want to make me a martyr.
[00:40:54.053 --> 00:40:58.454]  And if they give me cancer, it'll be a little obvious if I'm 33, 35, 40 years old.
[00:40:58.674 --> 00:41:00.074]  I'm 33 now if I die of that.
[00:41:00.094 --> 00:41:04.315]  By the way, they're a declassified program from the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s.
[00:41:04.435 --> 00:41:09.576]  There's Discovery Channel specials about how they have fast-acting viruses that kill you in a month.
[00:41:11.977 --> 00:41:17.778]  They've got weaponized cancer off the shelf, declassified, that'll kill you deader than a hammer, kill anybody deader than a hammer in a month.
[00:41:23.328 --> 00:41:24.529]  And it'll go right through the skin.
[00:41:25.089 --> 00:41:26.629]  Or they can aerosolize it where you breathe it.
[00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:31.011]  And they can have a vaccine for the officer that distributes it and gives it to you.
[00:41:33.672 --> 00:41:49.459]  Or they grab you, take you to some low-rent hotel, call a prostitute to the hotel, tie me up, shoot her in the head, shoot me in the head, and claim I committed suicide after I killed a whore.
[00:41:49.999 --> 00:41:51.120]  That's the kind of stuff they do.
[00:41:52.759 --> 00:41:55.880]  And if I had some smoking gun evidence, see I just covered stuff that's already come out.
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.802]  Doesn't matter if I was a cop, doesn't matter if I was a coroner, doesn't matter who I was, FBI, doesn't matter.
[00:42:02.002 --> 00:42:04.243]  But I could be an FBI Deputy Director like O'Neal.
[00:42:05.003 --> 00:42:06.184]  They'd kill me that in a hammer.
[00:42:08.605 --> 00:42:11.406]  But see I've said and done the work.
[00:42:11.506 --> 00:42:12.226]  I've put it out.
[00:42:12.856 --> 00:42:17.559]  And they kill me, they only make people pay a lot more attention to what I say, and they don't want that.
[00:42:17.799 --> 00:42:20.680]  Because what I say is the closest to the truth you're going to find anywhere.
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.142]  What I say is how the New World War really operates.
[00:42:23.382 --> 00:42:36.469]  What I say is from study and information and research and looking at history and really trying to grasp it and really meditating on the material, day after day, hour after hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:39.090]  I'm already digressing.
[00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:39.991]  I'm going to go back on the torture.
[00:42:43.195 --> 00:42:45.496]  I make the statement, these are hardcore evil killers.
[00:42:46.137 --> 00:42:47.237]  Why aren't you dead then?
[00:42:47.978 --> 00:42:59.464]  Well, if they, astute political scientists and others have made the point that if their darkness fully comes, if they fully take over, which they're trying to do, if they can seduce a nation, as Hitler seduced the Germans,
[00:43:00.649 --> 00:43:14.194]  If they can sell us that torture of children is good, and that it's cute and funny, and that it's what heroes do, and that secret arrest is good, they're going to do it, and they're making every attempt to do it, and then they won't care, and they'll just do it.
[00:43:14.534 --> 00:43:18.956]  And most people, out of fear, will go along with it, and even giggle and go to parades and cheer for it.
[00:43:20.796 --> 00:43:25.738]  It turned out, after they interviewed members of the Stasi in East Germany, and after they interviewed people in Romania under Ceausescu,
[00:43:28.462 --> 00:43:28.702]  I don't know.
[00:43:53.965 --> 00:43:56.105]  And it's a control freak's wonderland.
[00:43:56.706 --> 00:44:04.167]  Evil, pathetic people who weren't artists, who weren't scientists, who didn't have good ideas, who couldn't make it in a real free market world.
[00:44:04.527 --> 00:44:06.728]  They get to decide what's shown in the theater.
[00:44:07.048 --> 00:44:08.488]  They get to decide what's written.
[00:44:08.688 --> 00:44:10.208]  They get to decide what's said.
[00:44:10.429 --> 00:44:11.989]  They get to have all the starlets.
[00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:15.550]  They get to be worshipped for nothing more than being thugs.
[00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:21.871]  You better study what tyranny is, folks, before you embrace it.
[00:44:25.729 --> 00:44:29.270]  At the same time, we have to realize that people in this system are human beings, too.
[00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:36.873]  Federal Marshals, FBI, most of them are investigating bank robberies and child molesters and things like that.
[00:44:37.533 --> 00:44:43.495]  It's the evil cadres, the special units that have been created that are engaging in the evil, normally right out of the military.
[00:44:44.175 --> 00:44:46.276]  Right out of special forces, who like to kill.
[00:44:48.522 --> 00:44:54.967]  And I'll never forget going in in 2002, early 2002, to my friend's wife's 40th birthday at the Steakhouse in Austin.
[00:44:54.987 --> 00:44:56.288]  There's all these federal marshals out front.
[00:44:56.308 --> 00:44:59.270]  They go, Hey Alex, just whatever you do, don't stir up trouble.
[00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:00.251]  We like you, by the way.
[00:45:00.671 --> 00:45:02.052]  Listened to the radio show today.
[00:45:02.072 --> 00:45:02.673]  It was really good.
[00:45:02.733 --> 00:45:03.634]  Oh, what'd you, oh, this and that.
[00:45:04.054 --> 00:45:06.476]  Yeah, I'm not going to tell you who's in there, but we got guys in there.
[00:45:06.516 --> 00:45:08.137]  Just please be nice.
[00:45:08.177 --> 00:45:09.458]  And I was like, who's in there?
[00:45:10.479 --> 00:45:11.280]  Just be nice.
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:12.400]  And I was going to be nice anyways.
[00:45:12.801 --> 00:45:14.202]  Then I go in and it's the Bush daughters.
[00:45:15.635 --> 00:45:15.995]  I don't know.
[00:45:31.064 --> 00:45:33.605]  I mean, these are nice guys, and they were listening to the show!
[00:45:33.625 --> 00:45:35.527]  I was like, oh yeah, you listened to the show today.
[00:45:35.567 --> 00:45:36.267]  Okay, what was it?
[00:45:36.547 --> 00:45:37.948]  And he goes, okay, well, you talked about this.
[00:45:37.968 --> 00:45:38.828]  The other guy's like, yeah.
[00:45:39.449 --> 00:45:40.529]  Hold on, I'm calling in.
[00:45:40.549 --> 00:45:45.232]  The other guy's in the suburban, parked right in the handicap spot, calling into a KLBJ show.
[00:45:45.252 --> 00:45:46.833]  This is before I was on KLBJ.
[00:45:47.333 --> 00:45:48.134]  The guys are bored.
[00:45:48.514 --> 00:45:49.474]  They're into politics.
[00:45:50.935 --> 00:45:54.297]  We don't want to just have a revolution start and just go out and start blasting them.
[00:45:54.537 --> 00:45:55.878]  That'll help the New World Order.
[00:46:00.512 --> 00:46:10.959]  And I don't have to sit there and tell people like the federal marshals and others that memos saying you can sexually torture children is not good.
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.640]  You know that's bad!
[00:46:12.661 --> 00:46:13.781]  I mean, come on!
[00:46:14.001 --> 00:46:15.803]  We shouldn't even have to have this debate.
[00:46:16.363 --> 00:46:19.585]  But see, Bill Clinton is there selling torture.
[00:46:22.307 --> 00:46:26.230]  That's the name of my extra that's being suppressed and censored all over the web for martial law.
[00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:28.912]  We put it out for free on the web.
[00:46:30.411 --> 00:46:31.813]  And they still censor it.
[00:46:31.973 --> 00:46:33.734]  Oh, this is too hardcore for you to see.
[00:46:33.754 --> 00:46:35.576]  It must be taken down off YouTube and Google.
[00:46:36.957 --> 00:46:40.500]  So I tell everybody to just keep uploading it hundreds of times and make sure it gets out there.
[00:46:40.841 --> 00:46:43.423]  I mean, you want to watch police train to break people's arms?
[00:46:43.463 --> 00:46:46.385]  I mean, it's not right to rudely assault somebody.
[00:46:47.687 --> 00:46:49.048]  You can go into shock and die.
[00:46:49.108 --> 00:46:49.748]  People have.
[00:46:49.768 --> 00:46:52.451]  I mean, this is hardcore, folks.
[00:46:54.517 --> 00:47:00.338]  I don't want to be enemies with the police, but you're not allowed to break women's arms and men's arms because they're sitting on the sidewalk.
[00:47:01.759 --> 00:47:04.719]  You're not allowed to taser people because they won't answer your questions.
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.720]  You now have Clinton with the torture?
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.400]  That was quick, good job.
[00:47:10.121 --> 00:47:20.583]  Here's Bill Clinton Sunday on Meet the Press talking about how torture is a good thing under policy and how the guy just needs to do what he needs to do and that they'll decide through policy what's okay.
[00:47:20.623 --> 00:47:20.903]  Here it is.
[00:47:22.086 --> 00:47:26.888]  But I think what our policy ought to be is to be uncompromisingly opposed to terror.
[00:47:27.708 --> 00:47:28.589]  I mean, to torture.
[00:47:29.689 --> 00:47:34.571]  And that if you're the Jack Bauer person, you'll do whatever you do and you should be prepared to take the consequences.
[00:47:35.271 --> 00:47:38.793]  And I think the consequences will be imposed based on what turns out to be the truth.
[00:47:41.074 --> 00:47:42.694]  Now that's Bill Clinton doublespeak.
[00:47:43.414 --> 00:47:44.435]  Literal doublespeak.
[00:47:44.475 --> 00:47:45.935]  I mean, he is slick, man.
[00:47:47.616 --> 00:47:49.197]  By the way, it totally freaks me out.
[00:47:50.865 --> 00:48:00.253]  Some big, high-powered, top mogul Democrats were here in town, and they happen to know some of my family.
[00:48:00.293 --> 00:48:03.536]  Some of these people, it's a small town, especially when your dad's a physician.
[00:48:03.556 --> 00:48:08.460]  And that's where my sister went to school and stuff, so they also know all those people.
[00:48:08.621 --> 00:48:09.682]  She went to private school, I didn't.
[00:48:09.702 --> 00:48:10.782]  I went to the government training camp.
[00:48:12.484 --> 00:48:15.767]  But Bill Clinton was in town a few weeks ago, and they brought me up to him.
[00:48:17.239 --> 00:48:23.980]  When I later called and confirmed, I thought, oh, he's talking about Alex S. Jones, the New York Times writer, the head of the Shorenstein Center.
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:24.461]  He wasn't.
[00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:26.841]  They clarified, you mean Alex Jones.
[00:48:29.022 --> 00:48:30.482]  And of course, that's how weird Clinton is.
[00:48:30.542 --> 00:48:39.844]  Behind the scenes, with these 15 or so top Democrats, big Democrat power center here in Austin, he said, oh yeah, Alex Jones, he knows what's going on.
[00:48:42.544 --> 00:48:44.865]  Talks about a lot of really dangerous things.
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.701]  Gee, I don't like Bill Clinton knowing who I am.
[00:48:48.741 --> 00:48:50.942]  I don't like... This isn't a game to me.
[00:48:52.023 --> 00:48:53.623]  This isn't tiddlywinks.
[00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:54.744]  This isn't a joke!
[00:48:56.585 --> 00:48:57.966]  My dad called up telling me about it.
[00:48:57.986 --> 00:49:00.147]  I didn't believe it, so I made some phone calls and confirmed it.
[00:49:00.787 --> 00:49:06.389]  He was like... My dad normally is not gasping, but he was like going... Because he knows how dangerous this is.
[00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:11.512]  You think my dad wants to see his son get killed or be imprisoned or be framed?
[00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:13.491]  You think my mother wants that?
[00:49:13.731 --> 00:49:15.032]  You think my family wants that?
[00:49:15.392 --> 00:49:21.375]  But literally, I am a soldier in the Info War defending this Republic in its most dire hour.
[00:49:22.015 --> 00:49:23.936]  I don't have a choice.
[00:49:24.196 --> 00:49:25.977]  We've got to fight these people!
[00:49:28.459 --> 00:49:34.462]  Because history shows, you give in to these type of bullies, you give in to these type of propagandists, it gets really bad quick.
[00:49:35.336 --> 00:49:39.198]  All of you must go out and buy Alexander Schultz and Nietzsche's Gulag Archipelago.
[00:49:39.698 --> 00:49:42.660]  You know, I want to buy those in bulk and sell those on the website.
[00:49:51.704 --> 00:49:54.745]  I mean, Bill Clinton says, I'm against terror.
[00:49:55.486 --> 00:49:56.766]  And then he went, I mean torture.
[00:49:58.107 --> 00:49:59.028]  He double speaks it.
[00:49:59.128 --> 00:50:03.750]  And then he comes back and says, yeah, I think Jack Bowers need to do what they need to do.
[00:50:04.759 --> 00:50:06.860]  And then we'll see what happens based on the truth.
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:11.861]  I mean, that is an evil, wicked statement.
[00:50:11.881 --> 00:50:28.125]  I think what our policy ought to be is be uncompromisingly opposed to terror, I mean torture, and that if you're the Jack Bauer person, you do whatever you do, and you should be prepared to take the consequences, and I think the consequences will be imposed based on what turns out to be the truth, Clinton said.
[00:50:31.852 --> 00:50:40.039]  If you have any kind of formal expectation, people just drive a truck through it and they say, well, I thought it was covered by the exception.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.000]  Clinton added.
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:51.109]  The question was again raised to the host of Tim Russert where Clinton told him last year that he would authorize torture in a ticking bomb 24 style situation.
[00:50:51.149 --> 00:50:55.353]  See, Clinton says I would authorize torture and he literally double speaks.
[00:50:56.494 --> 00:50:57.675]  I mean, he is something else.
[00:51:04.697 --> 00:51:10.182]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.542 --> 00:51:18.148]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:25.922]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.323 --> 00:51:37.706]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.046 --> 00:51:41.948]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.008 --> 00:51:43.948]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.289 --> 00:51:48.130]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.457 --> 00:52:04.479]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:09.743]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.984 --> 00:52:14.327]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.627 --> 00:52:23.534]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.754 --> 00:52:27.357]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.657 --> 00:52:32.687]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.988 --> 00:52:39.701]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:40.191 --> 00:52:40.852]  What about you?
[00:52:41.492 --> 00:52:46.857]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:47.998]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:52:48.078 --> 00:52:49.979]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:53:01.377 --> 00:53:03.099]  It's not a matter of if, but when.
[00:53:03.479 --> 00:53:06.842]  If it happens, you want to be ready to give your loved ones a fighting chance.
[00:53:07.123 --> 00:53:11.547]  Do not rely on someone else to come through for you at a time when it could be about life and death.
[00:53:11.947 --> 00:53:16.932]  Your best chance is Safe Castle Royal, the premier crisis preparedness buyers club out there.
[00:53:17.273 --> 00:53:23.859]  Members get everything at rock-bottom pricing with at least 20% off everything in our store all the time and free shipping to the
[00:53:23.899 --> 00:53:24.479]  We're good to go.
[00:53:40.106 --> 00:53:40.526]  I think so.
[00:54:27.486 --> 00:54:29.807]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[00:54:29.867 --> 00:54:30.587]  until 2 p.m.
[00:54:31.448 --> 00:54:32.648]  Central Standard Time.
[00:54:33.889 --> 00:54:38.971]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:40.772 --> 00:54:51.356]  But you can always go to infowars.com and subscribe to the free podcast that downloads each day to anybody who wants to subscribe to their mp3 or iPod type device.
[00:54:54.386 --> 00:55:02.009]  So again, that's all up on InfoWars.com, and when the show ends each day, we also restream it consecutively for 21 hours until the next live show.
[00:55:02.969 --> 00:55:14.013]  I guess it streams for like 48 hours plus, because when we end on Friday, I don't do a show on Saturday, and it just restreams each hour consecutively until I come back live Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:55:16.674 --> 00:55:18.054]  Central Standard Time.
[00:55:21.135 --> 00:55:23.036]  Paul Watson's article then goes on to
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.341]  Give other places where he says he is for torture.
[00:55:27.841 --> 00:55:35.924]  And then he just reaffirmed it here in a double-speak type fashion, which just illustrates this is bipartisan.
[00:55:36.845 --> 00:55:44.968]  Let's play that other clip now, where he talks about a dynasty, he and Hillary, how it's not really a dynasty, because they're being elected.
[00:55:45.788 --> 00:55:50.750]  Or they're being selected and then given the campaign contributions, and then now with Bush, the last two times they're cheating,
[00:55:51.542 --> 00:55:54.885]  And I told you the Clintons and the Bushes were in bed together, and now it becomes more apparent.
[00:55:54.925 --> 00:55:55.345]  Here it is.
[00:55:55.966 --> 00:55:57.127]  For 20 of those 28 years.
[00:55:59.369 --> 00:56:12.721]  I think a dynasty, though, to be fair, when we think of dynasties in historical circumstances, it's King Louis I through 25, and you get it because of who your family is, not because of what your merits are.
[00:56:13.501 --> 00:56:17.165]  In her case, she clearly has established
[00:56:18.334 --> 00:56:21.915]  After leaving the White House, a totally different career path than I did.
[00:56:22.495 --> 00:56:34.259]  I'm operating from a different political base, with a set of expertise areas that I didn't bring to the White House, and for a very different time, where the security issues are much more important.
[00:56:35.479 --> 00:56:46.663]  And I think the real question here is not whether she's establishing a dynasty, but where, almost whether we should eliminate her because she happens to be my wife, if she is otherwise the person who would be the best president.
[00:56:47.712 --> 00:56:52.457]  I don't like it whenever anybody gets something they're not entitled to just because of who their family is.
[00:56:53.078 --> 00:57:02.787]  But in this case, I honestly believe, I'd be a voter 40 years next year, and I think she's the best suited, best qualified, non-incumbent I've had a chance to meet.
[00:57:02.807 --> 00:57:03.889]  Alright, enough from Clinton!
[00:57:06.716 --> 00:57:11.898]  Hillary Clinton wants national health care, and just like Edward, she says you'll have to go to the doctor each year.
[00:57:11.918 --> 00:57:17.561]  Can you imagine the state controlled by these global corporations having medical control over your body?
[00:57:18.821 --> 00:57:22.002]  And they always say, oh, no abortion, no control over my body.
[00:57:22.062 --> 00:57:24.584]  They're going to love making you take those shots.
[00:57:25.124 --> 00:57:27.365]  And they're going to love making you have those surgeries.
[00:57:27.745 --> 00:57:29.906]  And they're going to love making you take that chemo.
[00:57:30.266 --> 00:57:32.587]  And they're going to love running your life.
[00:57:35.664 --> 00:57:37.505]  And it's just hell on earth.
[00:57:37.765 --> 00:57:38.906]  It's just more control.
[00:57:38.926 --> 00:57:50.971]  And of course, I've got a story here where Canada's adopting, on a state-by-state basis now, it's racing across the country, some states have already passed it, carbon taxes, huge ones.
[00:57:52.012 --> 00:57:57.294]  And they're going to have taxes, they say, on how big your house can be, on any renovations you make.
[00:57:57.595 --> 00:57:58.755]  They've got to come inspect it.
[00:57:59.315 --> 00:58:02.417]  England just announced with no law, they just said by fiat, we're doing it.
[00:58:03.661 --> 00:58:04.221]  The U.S.
[00:58:04.421 --> 00:58:24.967]  Al Gore has proposed a house too big a car, there'll be a tax, you've got so many credits of carbon you can use in your footprint, and then more taxes kick in, and then there's all the federal control and bureaucracy that watches all of that, and just hysterical lines saying man's causing global heating, which by the way is just fabulous.
[00:58:27.427 --> 00:58:28.948]  9,000 years ago, the Bronze Age started.
[00:58:29.009 --> 00:58:29.990]  Incredible heat wave.
[00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:31.231]  10 degrees hotter than it is now.
[00:58:31.692 --> 00:58:32.152]  Doesn't matter.
[00:58:32.713 --> 00:58:34.975]  They've got a public that can't find Iraq on a map.
[00:58:35.055 --> 00:58:35.676]  Most people can't.
[00:58:35.936 --> 00:58:37.879]  So of course they're going to believe whatever the television says.
[00:58:38.299 --> 00:58:40.662]  Just like you believe the Federal Reserve loves you.

[00:59:03.939 --> 00:59:05.841]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.861 --> 00:59:09.183]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.703 --> 00:59:13.786]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.855 --> 00:59:26.016]  Last hour I talked about Bill Clinton.
[00:59:26.056 --> 00:59:28.676]  Torture, like on 24, is okay.
[00:59:32.237 --> 00:59:37.618]  He went on in the program with a longer clip to say it's okay doing what you have to do.
[00:59:40.299 --> 00:59:43.680]  And then the media at the same time denies torture is going on while they promote it.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:48.841]  And they admit that 24 Homeland Security said parties on C-SPAN
[00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:53.772]  We're celebrating it with the people from the show saying, thank you for all you've done, you've helped us.
[00:59:54.332 --> 00:59:59.274]  They admit it's a propaganda piece, selling everyone on a new hero, someone who tortures children.
[00:59:59.294 --> 01:00:02.215]  And they have all these other shows that do it.
[01:00:02.715 --> 01:00:10.218]  And then, I love the comments we got on the Dig page about it, where
[01:00:12.088 --> 01:00:15.670]  People said, okay, fine, but first we start with the New World Order.
[01:00:16.151 --> 01:00:16.511]  Great!
[01:00:16.651 --> 01:00:20.093]  Now we're letting fictional TV characters guide our national policy.
[01:00:20.673 --> 01:00:27.478]  So the government shouldn't support torture formally, but there should be an implicit understanding among agents that they gotta do what they gotta do.
[01:00:27.578 --> 01:00:28.979]  Nice double-speak build.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:38.645]  Those are the type of comments that our listeners were making on there, and the readers are making there.
[01:00:39.125 --> 01:00:40.286]  By the way, with Digg,
[01:00:42.217 --> 01:00:49.685]  If we had 500 people, and I know we have millions that tune into the show, who every day when Paul Watson posts articles at around 9 a.m.
[01:00:49.725 --> 01:00:51.767]  Central and around 5 p.m.
[01:00:51.827 --> 01:00:53.969]  Central, that's when he updates twice a day, sometimes more,
[01:00:54.602 --> 01:01:04.049]  And if you'd go in and dig those stories and hit them and dig them to the front page, and dig them off Jones Report and other places, they couldn't stop us from putting them on the front page.
[01:01:04.669 --> 01:01:07.251]  And a lot of the time their censors just pull us down anyways.
[01:01:07.271 --> 01:01:08.692]  They're not supposed to, but they admit they do.
[01:01:09.293 --> 01:01:13.156]  Even though we get the digs, they don't want millions to be able to see it.
[01:01:13.316 --> 01:01:17.579]  They won't catch them all, and we'll get millions more viewers and listeners and readers.
[01:01:18.189 --> 01:01:19.970]  I mean, these are chinks in the enemy's armor.
[01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:21.730]  Digs like number 40 on the web.
[01:01:21.951 --> 01:01:25.392]  Wikipedia censoring everywhere, erasing mainstream stuff.
[01:01:25.412 --> 01:01:27.993]  I mean, Kennedy assassination pages.
[01:01:28.713 --> 01:01:33.075]  They erased a page with E. Howard Hunt admitting he ran the op killing Kennedy.
[01:01:33.495 --> 01:01:35.536]  I mean, that was front page Rolling Stone magazine.
[01:01:35.616 --> 01:01:36.236]  Huge news.
[01:01:36.476 --> 01:01:38.517]  They said, nope, not newsworthy, erased.
[01:01:41.838 --> 01:01:43.859]  Oh, Alex Jones sneaking into Bohemian Grove.
[01:01:44.804 --> 01:01:45.525]  Bohemian Grove.
[01:01:45.685 --> 01:01:46.165]  Erased.
[01:01:46.886 --> 01:01:48.227]  Oh, Republican sex scandals.
[01:01:48.287 --> 01:01:51.530]  No, we're not going to have a page about gay porn stars in the White House.
[01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:52.131]  Erased.
[01:01:53.572 --> 01:01:55.474]  It's up to you to stop that.
[01:01:56.154 --> 01:01:57.535]  Alright, do we have Mike Rivero?
[01:01:59.657 --> 01:02:00.078]  Oh, good.
[01:02:00.138 --> 01:02:01.419]  I didn't know that.
[01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:02.420]  Mike Rivero.
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:07.284]  We're going to break here in a minute, my friend, as a Saturday morning show right here on the Genesis Network for two hours.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:14.903]  Uh, WhatReallyHappened.com, just out of the gate, what do you think of Bill Clinton out there double-speaking about torture again?
[01:02:15.863 --> 01:02:32.090]  Well, it's just another attempt to resell the idea that torture is really cool and acceptable, and they went through the same idea about, uh, you know, the hypothetical, what if you knew this one man could stop an atomic bomb going off in the city, wouldn't you torture him to, uh, uh, to get that information?
[01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.670]  And of course,
[01:02:33.101 --> 01:02:39.607]  It's one of these things where once you agree that that's acceptable, then you can say, well, then isn't this also acceptable?
[01:02:39.647 --> 01:02:41.008]  And isn't this also acceptable?
[01:02:41.548 --> 01:02:47.413]  And it's a way of luring people across a moral line past which they really can't go back.
[01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:51.052]  You have people saying, yeah, I'm okay with torture.
[01:02:51.452 --> 01:02:53.834]  Then they can never admit that they were wrong.
[01:02:53.874 --> 01:02:55.555]  They can never admit the government was wrong.
[01:02:55.996 --> 01:02:58.958]  And you have some of these people who said torture was really okay.
[01:02:59.278 --> 01:03:08.745]  And when you confront them with the fact that we, the United States, tortured to death Iraqis to find the weapons of mass destruction, and it turned out there never were any.
[01:03:09.201 --> 01:03:10.401]  They don't even want to hear it.
[01:03:10.462 --> 01:03:11.482]  They can't deal with it.
[01:03:11.742 --> 01:03:12.762]  They can't look at it.
[01:03:13.103 --> 01:03:15.483]  Because they're saying, well, you know, what if they had been there?
[01:03:15.503 --> 01:03:16.344]  We needed to find them.
[01:03:16.384 --> 01:03:17.124]  No, no, but they weren't.
[01:03:17.584 --> 01:03:23.787]  And now, and exactly now it extrapolates out that they knew there weren't WMDs and they're just selling us on it.
[01:03:24.387 --> 01:03:30.189]  And now the security guard breaks a little girl's arm and says, well, she didn't pick the cake up properly.
[01:03:31.209 --> 01:03:32.370]  It's paying compliance.
[01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:33.650]  Oh, you didn't show me your ID.
[01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:35.091]  I'm going to taser you.
[01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:37.772]  I mean, torture now is widespread and accepted.
[01:03:40.308 --> 01:03:41.369]  At least by their henchmen.
[01:03:41.429 --> 01:03:43.911]  Mike Rivero is our guest.
[01:03:45.272 --> 01:03:47.174]  We'll go straight back to him on the other side.
[01:03:47.194 --> 01:03:50.377]  We'll talk about the war, the economy, everything.
[01:03:53.283 --> 01:03:58.367]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:03:58.427 --> 01:04:05.753]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:04:05.893 --> 01:04:16.561]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:04:16.721 --> 01:04:21.285]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:04:21.545 --> 01:04:26.527]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[01:04:26.747 --> 01:04:29.689]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:04:29.909 --> 01:04:39.633]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black murky elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[01:04:40.853 --> 01:04:47.976]  It's here!
[01:04:48.156 --> 01:05:01.582]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:01.942 --> 01:05:09.545]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.279 --> 01:05:17.322]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.722 --> 01:05:29.107]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, the NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.447 --> 01:05:33.369]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.389 --> 01:05:35.370]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:39.532]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.297 --> 01:06:01.362]  Hi, this is Jeff Rents, and if you're interested in suppressed and natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[01:06:01.762 --> 01:06:11.047]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[01:06:11.427 --> 01:06:15.730]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:28.318]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineral-like compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory, and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery, and arthritis.
[01:06:28.618 --> 01:06:33.541]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[01:06:33.922 --> 01:06:37.284]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound, and the best part?
[01:06:37.664 --> 01:06:39.165]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.627]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[01:06:41.647 --> 01:06:43.588]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[01:06:44.008 --> 01:06:45.529]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[01:06:46.649 --> 01:06:51.772]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:06:53.012 --> 01:06:58.055]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.415 --> 01:07:00.736]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:02.937 --> 01:07:07.079]  We have launched a new website that Kurt Nemo is going to be editing and running.
[01:07:07.219 --> 01:07:08.159]  Truthnews.us
[01:07:11.568 --> 01:07:17.829]  We got hack attacked a few months ago when I complained about Wikipedia censorship.
[01:07:18.569 --> 01:07:21.650]  And so I made the announcement that we would divide again.
[01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:23.130]  That's what we do.
[01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:25.230]  When you attack us, we only intensify.
[01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:34.652]  And if the new order ever kills me or ever sets me up, I want all of you to pledge to make 1,000 copies of Endgame and 1,000 copies of Terror Storm.
[01:07:34.672 --> 01:07:39.953]  I know a lot of you aren't going to do that, but if I did get whacked, I'm asking you
[01:07:40.709 --> 01:07:46.510]  To go even more insane with the material, more insane with the information, more aggressive.
[01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:55.712]  Shifting gears with Michael Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com, just a great political mind on the New World Order, who I really respect and appreciate joining us once a month.
[01:07:56.632 --> 01:07:58.432]  He's a syndicated talk show host in his own right.
[01:07:59.073 --> 01:08:06.634]  Mike, I want to get into the torture and into the war, but I was just thinking earlier this morning
[01:08:07.728 --> 01:08:10.816]  I think Paul Watson's doing an article on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:08:11.999 --> 01:08:15.508]  I'm seeing a video, a new video, every day.
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:17.760]  The last two weeks.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.981]  And before that, every other day.
[01:08:19.021 --> 01:08:19.721]  It's exponential.
[01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:21.282]  I mean, I haven't counted them up.
[01:08:21.322 --> 01:08:22.902]  It's got to be like 30, 40 of them.
[01:08:23.642 --> 01:08:35.887]  Everywhere Giuliani goes, sometimes two or three times, like one time he got confronted three times in one day in two different cities, 9-11 truthers are showing up and saying, hey, you said you got told to get out of Building 7.
[01:08:36.247 --> 01:08:38.608]  The Tower 1 and 2 were going to fall before they did.
[01:08:39.028 --> 01:08:40.448]  Hey, you were running drills that day.
[01:08:40.488 --> 01:08:42.289]  Hey, the memos came out.
[01:08:43.226 --> 01:08:48.229]  That you knew the air was bad to breathe, and you worked with Bush to cover that up, which is now public.
[01:08:48.469 --> 01:08:57.633]  And he lies about that, and the media's going and checking, and then there's mainstream articles in the New York Times, and on New York NBC, and on newspapers in Florida.
[01:08:57.673 --> 01:08:59.014]  I mean, it's hurting him.
[01:08:59.754 --> 01:09:11.760]  And this phenomenon of... Fred Thompson's been confronted like ten times now, and Obama and Hillary, and everywhere they go, they were at Marvin Bush's house.
[01:09:12.478 --> 01:09:19.125]  Where they, by the way, had the mysterious death of the housekeeper being run over by the car in the front yard, which was impossible the way it happened.
[01:09:19.725 --> 01:09:22.749]  I mean, these guys are in front of his house, the big gate, bullhorning him.
[01:09:23.129 --> 01:09:29.976]  I mean, this is explosive because it's all these uncoordinated mini-revolutions everywhere.
[01:09:30.356 --> 01:09:33.600]  And let me tell you, when somebody gets in your space and comes to your house, I've had it happen.
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:35.642]  I mean, it's very disconcerting.
[01:09:36.182 --> 01:09:43.645]  I mean, we're literally like dogs on a big bear, nipping at them, driving them over the cliff.
[01:09:43.965 --> 01:09:46.226]  This phenomenon, Michael Rivero, speak to it.
[01:09:47.046 --> 01:09:58.671]  Well, obviously, I'm absolutely thrilled to see it, because what it means is that your ordinary American citizen has really reached the point of just being fed up with all the lies.
[01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:07.104]  I'm very happy to see that it's a younger crowd because, you know, it is the younger generation that's going to pay for our failings to get this country back on track.
[01:10:07.464 --> 01:10:15.626]  And they're starting to stand up and realize that it's not just going to go away, that they need to get out there and they, like everybody else, they want the truth.
[01:10:16.026 --> 01:10:17.767]  They know that they are owed the truth.
[01:10:18.107 --> 01:10:26.789]  They understand that the government is not allowed under the Constitution to lie to the people and that when the government is lying, it ceases to be the legal government.
[01:10:27.176 --> 01:10:33.060]  And I think very much this get-in-their-face and confrontational situation, it's going to continue and it's going to escalate.
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:35.481]  We're unfortunately going to see the other side fighting back.
[01:10:35.501 --> 01:10:37.002]  There's probably going to be more taserings.
[01:10:37.658 --> 01:10:42.860]  More effort to try and only allow selected people in to various political meetings.
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:56.864]  We saw an article Paul Joseph Watson put up just today about peace activists just doing nothing but reading the Constitution, being arrested and hauled away, while pro-war activists are allowed to simply chant and wave their banners all over the place.
[01:10:57.164 --> 01:10:58.624]  There was a huge protest in D.C.
[01:10:58.664 --> 01:10:59.365]  this last weekend.
[01:10:59.385 --> 01:11:03.566]  The mainstream media absolutely, totally blocked it out, did not report it.
[01:11:04.105 --> 01:11:06.670]  So, you know, it is definitely escalating.
[01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:08.133]  And as you say, it's leaderless.
[01:11:08.854 --> 01:11:11.679]  It is a lot of independent people just deciding they've had enough.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.967]  And all these little mini revolutions, and it's just going to keep on building and building.
[01:11:16.565 --> 01:11:36.410]  And the only way we're ever going to get closure on any of this stuff is for the government to come clean and say, yes, you were lied to about X, Y, Z. And this article that came out today in the Chicago Tribune about the USS Liberty is only going to fuel the anger of people who have suspected all along that they're being lied to about this.
[01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:39.211]  The American people aren't going to stand for being lied to.
[01:11:39.451 --> 01:11:44.032]  Once it's in their face and they can't pretend it doesn't exist anymore, they're going to get very angry.
[01:11:45.609 --> 01:11:50.421]  Well, that's why the elite have preemptively been brainwashing the police and the military against us.
[01:11:50.501 --> 01:11:51.805]  It hasn't been working very well.
[01:11:51.865 --> 01:11:53.429]  I've talked to a lot of military and police.
[01:11:54.221 --> 01:11:59.143]  But either they drink the Kool-Aid completely, or they completely understand that it's all a fraud.
[01:11:59.203 --> 01:12:06.565]  And, you know, 75% of the troops now, 82% in major polls, and the last Gallup poll are against the war.
[01:12:06.585 --> 01:12:14.088]  And then Limbaugh calls the troops that are against the war cowards and says that they're not real troops, they're fake soldiers.
[01:12:14.128 --> 01:12:16.789]  I mean, that's not going to work any longer.
[01:12:16.809 --> 01:12:22.951]  And that's why I was just reading that the Attorney General, the new Attorney General they're about to approve,
[01:12:24.386 --> 01:12:32.569]  This foreign dual citizen, this guy, had 28 million dollars of U.S.
[01:12:32.609 --> 01:12:36.090]  Marshal Protection in a 7 year period.
[01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:46.994]  One judge, this is AP, 28 million dollars in protection all because he did the 1993 terror bombing.
[01:12:47.434 --> 01:12:49.135]  Of course, that was a government op.
[01:12:49.941 --> 01:13:05.392]  And then so you've got the very terrorist with a minion who covers up the fact that it's admitted, mainstream news, the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the driver, carried out the attacks, ordered the informants to stand back and let it happen, the informants freaked out and recorded them ordering it, and then it turns out
[01:13:06.329 --> 01:13:29.959]  That the foreign agent we're going to have as an Attorney General openly had demanded $28 million in protection and then the Marshals, he was so rude and so mean it says, this is mainstream news, refused to protect him anymore and said that they weren't allowed to use the toilets, they were treated bad, they were treated like dogs by him and his wife, and $28 million in protection?
[01:13:30.758 --> 01:13:37.102]  I mean, this, I mean, my point is that's why they want a police state, is so we can't bullhorn them, so we can't yell at them.
[01:13:37.303 --> 01:13:45.668]  So as they do more and more bad things, we're all walled off in the other part of the city and don't have our special pass that lets us, you know, go down the road.
[01:13:45.708 --> 01:13:51.132]  That's why they want us all transpondered in our cars and tracked, so they know where we're going and what we're doing.
[01:13:51.172 --> 01:13:52.012]  But I got news for them.
[01:13:52.212 --> 01:14:00.358]  You can't stop us all from, openly speaking, I mean, the video in D.C., and we checked, an unpermitted neocon rally,
[01:14:01.238 --> 01:14:02.539]  What's wrong with them, Mike?
[01:14:22.998 --> 01:14:24.518]  Well, they're desperate.
[01:14:24.919 --> 01:14:28.039]  They realize that they are losing the battle for the minds of America.
[01:14:28.299 --> 01:14:30.220]  They're losing it to independent radio.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.440]  They're losing it to the blogs.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:39.262]  And all of this screaming, high-pitched hysteria really is a sign of impending defeat.
[01:14:39.582 --> 01:14:42.163]  They're losing control of the minds of America.
[01:14:42.223 --> 01:14:43.223]  People are speaking out.
[01:14:44.004 --> 01:14:49.325]  And as you said before, and this gets back to what you were talking about, that schoolgirl getting her arm broken over crumbs.
[01:14:49.947 --> 01:14:57.389]  You know, the American police and private security are starting to treat Americans the way the army treats the Iraqis, and for exactly the same reason.
[01:14:57.429 --> 01:15:02.490]  To keep them scared, to keep them down, to keep them from fighting back against the occupation.
[01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:09.251]  It is amazing how similar, in terms of the psychology, we're seeing the government treat both Americans and Iraqis.
[01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:13.232]  We're both conquered peoples, we're not supposed to stand up and fight for our rights.
[01:15:13.892 --> 01:15:19.473]  This story coming out of the Arizona airport about the woman supposedly choking herself with her handcuffs,
[01:15:20.452 --> 01:15:22.853]  I mean, if you believe that, I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
[01:15:23.113 --> 01:15:26.954]  It's admitted that they jumped on her neck with their knees, like they like to do.
[01:15:27.294 --> 01:15:28.375]  Of course it killed her!
[01:15:29.215 --> 01:15:31.796]  And now there's a big investigation!
[01:15:32.996 --> 01:15:39.738]  Well, there's going to be a lot of pressure coming from the Bush administration to just basically let these cops walk, because when you turn the police
[01:15:40.145 --> 01:15:40.365]  I think?
[01:16:00.294 --> 01:16:17.961]  And the Bush administration and the neocons are going to do their very best to make sure that the police are never punished no matter what they do because that sends a message out that you better power and bow down before a uniform and a badge and know your place or they can basically kill you if they want and nothing will be done.
[01:16:18.302 --> 01:16:21.503]  And that is really why we've got to watch what happens in this Arizona case.
[01:16:22.303 --> 01:16:29.026]  And we're literally being brought into third world serfdom with a high-tech 21st century nightmare icing.
[01:16:30.976 --> 01:16:31.776]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:32.236 --> 01:16:35.878]  The principles are exactly the same as every other dictatorship in history.
[01:16:35.898 --> 01:16:38.859]  It's just the tools are a little bit different and a little bit hipper.
[01:16:40.079 --> 01:16:41.280]  But it's not working!
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:43.320]  I mean, it's all coming out on the web.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.421]  All the I'm-gonna-frame-you's coming out.
[01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:47.782]  Good cops are starting to speak out against it.
[01:16:48.282 --> 01:16:55.044]  What would you tell good military, good police, which are still the majority, but when 30% of the cops are bad, man, we're in trouble.
[01:16:55.424 --> 01:16:58.245]  I mean, what would you tell... and the bad cops are being promoted.
[01:16:58.686 --> 01:16:59.826]  What would you tell good cops?
[01:17:00.786 --> 01:17:02.788]  I would tell everybody exactly the same thing.
[01:17:02.888 --> 01:17:14.937]  Remember that the Constitution is the original contract with America, and when the government is not obeying their half of the contract, then we, the people, are released from our obligations to that government.
[01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:24.725]  And this gets back to that whole thing about a government lying to us about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, or who did 9-11, or... And by the way, that's important, Mike.
[01:17:24.925 --> 01:17:26.646]  They didn't mess up and were wrong.
[01:17:26.726 --> 01:17:27.707]  They knew they were lying.
[01:17:28.439 --> 01:17:35.844]  Oh, they absolutely were lying, and they were, you know, there was forged Niger documents, there was the Daji dossier, they knew they were lying.
[01:17:35.964 --> 01:17:45.070]  And once a government lies, it ceases to be the legal government of this country, and we are under no obligation to support them, to pay their bills, to obey their dictates.
[01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:56.157]  They are an occupying power, and we, the people, are constitutionally empowered and mandated to remove an occupying power from our government.
[01:17:59.045 --> 01:18:09.377]  I just hope they know, at a basic level, I'm not their enemy.
[01:18:09.437 --> 01:18:16.445]  I want them to have a nice house and be free and have a swimming pool and have their liberties and be able to raise their children as they see fit.
[01:18:16.505 --> 01:18:17.266]  I'm not their enemy.
[01:18:19.977 --> 01:18:26.823]  250 pound guy just got out of the military with devil tats and a shaved head and a goatee out there searching some woman on the side of the highway.
[01:18:26.863 --> 01:18:29.185]  That's not freedom and that guy's going to war.
[01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:32.448]  And he's going to war against us.
[01:18:33.249 --> 01:18:33.890]  Absolutely.
[01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.971]  Mike, stay there.
[01:18:34.991 --> 01:18:38.354]  I want to get into the drumbeats for attack on Iran.
[01:18:38.374 --> 01:18:42.037]  New York Sun, other big papers saying the war is on.
[01:18:42.537 --> 01:18:45.780]  Reports of the Bashir reactor being evacuated from Debka file.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:46.721]  I don't know if that's true.
[01:18:48.142 --> 01:18:49.663]  Arab papers are saying that too.
[01:18:50.204 --> 01:18:51.245]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[01:18:53.268 --> 01:18:56.289]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:18:56.609 --> 01:19:01.531]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:06.132]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:06.433 --> 01:19:15.336]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:19:15.556 --> 01:19:19.157]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:19:19.457 --> 01:19:24.484]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:19:24.784 --> 01:19:31.493]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:32.661]  What about you?
[01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:38.667]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:39.808]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:19:39.888 --> 01:19:41.770]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:54.001]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:58.862]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:19:59.022 --> 01:20:06.824]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:20:07.084 --> 01:20:12.465]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:20:12.665 --> 01:20:19.647]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:20:19.947 --> 01:20:25.289]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:20:25.549 --> 01:20:30.270]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:20:30.610 --> 01:20:38.193]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:20:38.553 --> 01:20:44.795]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:20:45.115 --> 01:20:46.776]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:48.056 --> 01:20:49.857]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.418 --> 01:20:54.518]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:20:54.898 --> 01:20:57.959]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:20:58.219 --> 01:21:02.741]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:21:03.141 --> 01:21:05.763]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:21:06.243 --> 01:21:10.626]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run.
[01:21:10.967 --> 01:21:13.028]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:21:13.448 --> 01:21:18.692]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:21:19.092 --> 01:21:20.773]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:21:21.254 --> 01:21:24.536]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:21:25.096 --> 01:21:28.479]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[01:21:28.539 --> 01:21:35.525]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[01:21:35.865 --> 01:21:41.270]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:44.492]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now!
[01:21:44.772 --> 01:21:45.153]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:21:45.193 --> 01:21:45.533]  That's 888-873-7371 today!
[01:21:53.336 --> 01:21:53.556]  I think?
[01:22:08.416 --> 01:22:09.277]  We're good to go.
[01:22:33.596 --> 01:22:33.896]  I think so.
[01:23:03.633 --> 01:23:05.717]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:05.757 --> 01:23:09.442]  We're talking to Mike Rivero of WhatReallyHappened.com right now.
[01:23:10.584 --> 01:23:11.806]  I've launched a new website.
[01:23:11.846 --> 01:23:14.771]  I'm asking all my friends and associates and fellow
[01:23:15.993 --> 01:23:20.336]  Freedom Fighters to join us in promoting and getting the word out about this new site.
[01:23:20.436 --> 01:23:22.797]  It's going to have a lot of original news.
[01:23:22.817 --> 01:23:36.425]  It's done by Kurt Nemo and video selections and audio selections he thinks are most important and the great daily articles he writes and news blurbs and also a spectrum of alternative and mainstream news trying to give you a clear picture of what's happening in this fight against the globalists.
[01:23:36.825 --> 01:23:39.086]  And that's TruthNews.us.
[01:23:39.867 --> 01:23:42.448]  TruthNews.us.
[01:23:43.289 --> 01:23:43.529]  Mike,
[01:23:47.145 --> 01:23:48.366]  People can't believe it.
[01:23:48.606 --> 01:23:52.387]  We've got 80 plus percent of the American people against war, 70 plus percent of the troops.
[01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:53.608]  The military is falling apart.
[01:23:54.068 --> 01:23:56.769]  They can't believe they're actually going to go into Iran.
[01:23:57.730 --> 01:24:04.913]  But the neocons are in the New York Post, in New York Sun, and a bunch of other publications saying, no, we're going in.
[01:24:04.953 --> 01:24:07.354]  The aircraft carriers are all sitting there.
[01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:10.716]  Do you think they're still going to do it, or what do you think is going to happen?
[01:24:11.585 --> 01:24:13.466]  Yeah, I think they're still going to do it.
[01:24:13.506 --> 01:24:18.849]  They're trying desperately to find some kind of a justification that will get the American people to sit still.
[01:24:19.710 --> 01:24:28.815]  You know, they were trying to say nuclear bombs, nuclear bombs, but after the embarrassment of Iraq, obviously this is not something that's getting a lot of traction right now.
[01:24:29.455 --> 01:24:37.420]  As Seymour Hersh points out, they're trying to basically now blame the disaster in Iraq on Iranian interference.
[01:24:38.052 --> 01:24:45.778]  Again, this is a claim that's made without any real proof whatsoever, but this seems to be the excuse they're trying to say justifies going into Iran.
[01:24:46.158 --> 01:25:02.690]  The problem is, it's one thing when the leadership just doesn't care what the American people are thinking, and certainly they're very much out of touch with that right now, but the other one is, they don't seem to really be in touch with the current state of our military because
[01:25:03.459 --> 01:25:07.141]  Whether we could sustain an invasion of Iran is another matter.
[01:25:07.181 --> 01:25:16.104]  Now, there's no question they can go in there and they can bomb, you know, the crap out of a lot of places in there, especially if they use some of those nuclear bunker buster bombs.
[01:25:17.025 --> 01:25:18.865]  But after they bomb, what are they going to do?
[01:25:18.945 --> 01:25:20.306]  Just say, we're done and go home?
[01:25:21.154 --> 01:25:23.215]  That really doesn't make a whole heck of a lot of sense.
[01:25:23.335 --> 01:25:38.042]  I'd like to know where they think they're going to get the troops to conduct a ground war in Iran, especially given that Iran was not already weakened by 10 years of sanctions the way Iraq was, and right now the US forces are barely able to hang on to Iraq.
[01:25:38.342 --> 01:25:42.424]  They're really not hanging on to much outside of the Green Zone and a couple of key fire bases.
[01:25:43.885 --> 01:25:48.907]  We're not doing very well in Afghanistan, and it's beginning to remind me
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:50.181]  Very much.
[01:25:50.561 --> 01:26:02.050]  Of the last days of World War II, when Hitler was ordering around armies that just didn't exist anymore, and his high command were so scared of him, they didn't want to tell him that those armies didn't exist anymore.
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:12.363]  And it almost seems like Bush and the neocons... Well, that's why Bush, exactly, that's why Bush keeps replacing the Iraq commanders on average every four months.
[01:26:12.743 --> 01:26:17.384]  I mean, Secretary White was a complete New World Order minion running scams at Enron.
[01:26:17.464 --> 01:26:21.785]  He gave congressmen tours of fake computers that weren't hooked to real trading.
[01:26:22.065 --> 01:26:23.466]  I mean, he was an insider and he said,
[01:26:24.806 --> 01:26:28.929]  We need 400,000 men to secure this, and Bush said, we're not going to secure it.
[01:26:28.969 --> 01:26:30.089]  We're breaking the place down.
[01:26:30.129 --> 01:26:31.410]  And he said, I don't want to be part of that.
[01:26:31.810 --> 01:26:32.791]  And they said, you're fired.
[01:26:34.291 --> 01:26:41.835]  Well, we're definitely seeing a lot of military being replaced, but that's not going to change the reality that they don't have the ground forces to go in and support.
[01:26:42.055 --> 01:26:42.736]  No, exactly.
[01:26:42.756 --> 01:26:43.396]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:26:43.436 --> 01:26:44.817]  That backs up what you're saying.
[01:26:44.917 --> 01:26:45.938]  It's just delusional.
[01:26:45.998 --> 01:26:48.999]  I mean, what's wrong with the Chertoffs and the neocons?
[01:26:49.039 --> 01:26:50.500]  I mean, they just think they're invincible.
[01:26:51.631 --> 01:27:09.607]  Well, I think the goal really is just to smash Israel's enemies, and they don't care what the effects are on the United States, because ultimately this is all being driven by Israel, and when Israel trashes the United States, they'll just find somebody else to be their patron saint, and take over from where the U.S.
[01:27:09.667 --> 01:27:11.689]  is to support Israel's aggressions in the area.
[01:27:12.205 --> 01:27:19.891]  But it really, you know, this is a war that the U.S., we're already losing two wars and we're going to have a third one we're going to be losing very, very quickly.
[01:27:20.111 --> 01:27:32.360]  Now I want to touch on another topic here real quick because remember when I said they can't get traction for the war in Iran, a new war in Iran, they're losing support for the wars in Iraq and I want to remind everybody back during Vietnam,
[01:27:32.978 --> 01:27:46.142]  When the anti-war movement really got going and the war became really unpopular, all of a sudden we had a huge racial crisis, where we had the Black Panthers, and we had this, and we had all these other things going on that dominated the American news.
[01:27:46.202 --> 01:27:47.322]  Divide and conquer!
[01:27:47.342 --> 01:27:49.283]  They're going to try to use the illegal alien situation.
[01:27:49.883 --> 01:27:56.265]  Well, not only that, but look at this situation out of Genesix, and now all of a sudden we're getting nuisance tied on campuses across the country.
[01:27:56.801 --> 01:28:00.882]  Somebody is really trying to fan black-on-white patriarchy right now.
[01:28:00.922 --> 01:28:03.023]  Well, it came out that it was a neocon op.
[01:28:03.103 --> 01:28:05.304]  It turned out those cartoons were fake by fake.
[01:28:05.604 --> 01:28:07.064]  They weren't done by real artists.
[01:28:07.144 --> 01:28:14.587]  It turned out that those two neocon-run papers took video stills and then cartoonized them, and it was fake.
[01:28:14.947 --> 01:28:20.989]  And then they staged a few riots and then got the Muslims to actually do what they wanted, and then Europe votes for Sarkozy.
[01:28:22.336 --> 01:28:24.738]  Uh, yeah, and it's the same stuff all over again.
[01:28:24.778 --> 01:28:28.441]  It's like going back to the Black Panther coloring book that was put out by the FBI.
[01:28:28.922 --> 01:28:29.342]  Stay there!
[01:28:29.382 --> 01:28:30.103]  Let's talk about that.
[01:28:30.143 --> 01:28:32.305]  Let's explain, go back and look at that.
[01:28:32.345 --> 01:28:33.586]  This is how they operate, folks.
[01:28:33.606 --> 01:28:34.306]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:28:34.326 --> 01:28:35.367]  We gotta come together.
[01:28:35.667 --> 01:28:40.391]  They try to get us into sex and different groups in our own little factions.
[01:28:40.632 --> 01:28:41.052]  No!
[01:28:43.474 --> 01:28:44.455]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.855 --> 01:28:46.517]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.397 --> 01:28:50.100]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.465 --> 01:28:53.886]  Attention!
[01:28:54.026 --> 01:28:55.988]  This is an urgent GCN News Bulletin!
[01:28:56.189 --> 01:29:00.454]  Honeybees are now mysteriously vanishing at an astonishing pace across the entire country.
[01:29:00.614 --> 01:29:03.558]  Why is this urgent message about honeybees so desperately important?
[01:29:03.778 --> 01:29:04.739]  The answer is easy.
[01:29:04.879 --> 01:29:11.027]  You see, honeybees produce a unique compound, fed only to the queen, that makes her live six times longer than other bees in the hive.
[01:29:11.287 --> 01:29:15.329]  Some researchers now believe the compound may have miraculous effects on humans as well.
[01:29:15.509 --> 01:29:21.453]  The compound is called Royal Jelly, and is now available in an all-new, ultra-purified form called Gelosene Gold.
[01:29:21.653 --> 01:29:27.056]  The product has been designed for purity-conscious Americans who are concerned about contaminated Royal Jelly entering the U.S.
[01:29:27.076 --> 01:29:27.536]  from Asia.
[01:29:27.736 --> 01:29:32.099]  Solutions from Science is the only company authorized to sell Gelosene Gold in the U.S.
[01:29:32.339 --> 01:29:36.101]  They believe it to be the purest, most potent, and safest form of Royal Jelly in the world.
[01:29:36.141 --> 01:29:36.841]  I think so.
[01:29:53.442 --> 01:29:55.824]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:29:56.344 --> 01:29:57.825]  After a pedicure they look great.
[01:29:58.165 --> 01:30:01.988]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:30:02.428 --> 01:30:04.629]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:30:05.050 --> 01:30:08.392]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:30:08.792 --> 01:30:11.274]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:30:11.774 --> 01:30:12.815]  What's that name again?
[01:30:13.215 --> 01:30:14.396]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:15.937]  It's CalX.
[01:30:16.357 --> 01:30:18.198]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:30:18.539 --> 01:30:20.380]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[01:30:21.169 --> 01:30:29.772]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:30:30.212 --> 01:30:35.933]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:30:36.314 --> 01:30:47.437]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Phyllo, Card Drug, HEB grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:30:48.095 --> 01:30:49.216]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[01:30:49.536 --> 01:30:50.216]  I'll be right back.
[01:30:50.336 --> 01:30:52.077]  I'm getting some Calix for my heels.
[01:30:53.358 --> 01:30:58.842]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:30:59.282 --> 01:31:03.504]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:03.925 --> 01:31:10.789]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:11.229 --> 01:31:17.933]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:18.253 --> 01:31:19.854]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:31:20.154 --> 01:31:23.355]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:23.615 --> 01:31:24.816]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:25.076 --> 01:31:26.077]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:31:26.377 --> 01:31:27.517]  BioSolutions has over 550
[01:31:28.558 --> 01:31:28.858]  I think so.
[01:31:58.234 --> 01:32:00.135]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:00.636 --> 01:32:03.458]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:03.718 --> 01:32:27.695]  We're going to open the phones up and talk about the war, torture, Bill of Rights under attack, solutions,
[01:32:30.828 --> 01:32:34.170]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:34.190 --> 01:32:34.690]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:46.237]  I want to talk about dynasties and what it's going to be like with Hillary Clinton ruling over us, and how Mike thinks the left is going to respond to that.
[01:32:46.597 --> 01:32:48.658]  She'll no doubt attack a bunch more countries.
[01:32:48.998 --> 01:32:49.819]  She's sworn to do it.
[01:32:49.839 --> 01:32:50.799]  It's the very same crowd.
[01:32:50.819 --> 01:32:53.301]  I also want to get his response.
[01:32:55.990 --> 01:33:09.875]  I ask him this each month, but he gives us different angles of his view about where all this is going in the future, and how we should fight socialized healthcare that seeks to control us, and also the new feudal system that they're going to do under the guise of carbon tax.
[01:33:10.235 --> 01:33:12.676]  So those three big topics coming up in your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:12.696 --> 01:33:14.496]  And the new editor and head of TruthNews.us,
[01:33:25.069 --> 01:33:35.114]  Firebrand, great writer, great researcher, great political mind in his own right, Kurt Nemo, joining us coming up from TruthNews.us in the next hour.
[01:33:35.134 --> 01:33:39.577]  Who knows, maybe I'll even try to keep Mike over if he can a few minutes to say hi to Kurt.
[01:33:39.997 --> 01:33:41.398]  It's always great to have those two together.
[01:33:41.418 --> 01:33:47.521]  I don't think I've ever done that, but I've interviewed them both respectively, and it's always good to have other folks together in the mix.
[01:33:47.841 --> 01:33:49.222]  Before we go back to Mike Rivera,
[01:33:50.299 --> 01:33:51.239]  We're good to go.
[01:34:10.132 --> 01:34:15.598]  Uh, it's just, it's beautiful double-stamped coins, and the Liberty Dollar's been around for a long time.
[01:34:15.618 --> 01:34:16.999]  Well, this is the Ron Paul Dollar.
[01:34:17.339 --> 01:34:18.520]  RonPaulDollar.net.
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:19.361]  What a collector!
[01:34:19.722 --> 01:34:20.983]  I've got one of the gold coins.
[01:34:21.103 --> 01:34:21.623]  Beautiful.
[01:34:21.643 --> 01:34:22.684]  888-LIB-DOLLAR.
[01:34:22.704 --> 01:34:23.405]  888-LIB-DOLLAR.
[01:34:26.471 --> 01:34:26.951]  We're good to go.
[01:34:52.805 --> 01:34:54.886]  And by the way, just a program note here about what I'm doing.
[01:34:55.387 --> 01:34:57.428]  We had four showings of endgame here in Austin, Texas.
[01:34:57.808 --> 01:34:58.929]  I finished it a month ago.
[01:34:59.089 --> 01:35:00.049]  And it won't be out.
[01:35:00.069 --> 01:35:00.930]  You can start pre-orders.
[01:35:21.505 --> 01:35:22.826]  Pre-orders will start Friday.
[01:35:23.046 --> 01:35:25.787]  We could start tomorrow, but pre-orders aren't going to start until Friday.
[01:35:26.287 --> 01:35:29.368]  And that means we're getting them in, by the way, tomorrow.
[01:35:29.488 --> 01:35:30.468]  We've got the tracking number.
[01:35:30.548 --> 01:35:34.850]  Thousands are coming here to the little office, little garage slash warehouse.
[01:35:35.850 --> 01:35:37.791]  And we will pre-package them.
[01:35:37.811 --> 01:35:43.953]  We will put UPS stickers, or if you choose, USPS stickers, on them.
[01:35:44.333 --> 01:35:48.955]  Have them ready, piled up for
[01:35:49.978 --> 01:35:50.399]  November 1st.
[01:36:01.477 --> 01:36:20.353]  Coming up on Friday, we'll have links to the shopping cart up on WhatIsTheEndgame.com or EndgameMovie.com and of course on InfoWars and all the other sites where you can go right over to our Yahoo shopping cart and order there or you can go ahead and write to us and then we'll go ahead and process your order and put it in and have it packaged and ready to ship out for you.
[01:36:20.694 --> 01:36:23.136]  And that's coming up now in just like three weeks, three and a half weeks.
[01:36:23.736 --> 01:36:31.102]  And that will blast past, as you know, like three shakes of a lamb's tail or a twinkle in the eye, whatever, however you want to put it.
[01:36:31.422 --> 01:36:38.909]  So you can have Endgame on DVD first, with the 45 minutes of extras, the two-hour, 20-minute film.
[01:36:39.349 --> 01:36:41.230]  I mean, this sucker is jam-packed.
[01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:52.880]  The history of the New World Order, the currently what they're doing with the three super unions, and then their plan to exterminate through neo-eugenics and transhumanism 80% of the world's population.
[01:36:53.877 --> 01:36:55.999]  It is going to be available at the end of this week.
[01:36:56.819 --> 01:37:05.085]  Now, we're going to be shipping these out November 1st, and you should be getting them by the first week of November, but for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:37:07.328 --> 01:37:13.869]  October 26th it is going to be up on PrisonPlanet.tv so get your 15 cents a day membership.
[01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:15.250]  That just pays for the bandwidth.
[01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:20.891]  I went and got a fancy, went into Hawk basically to get the best content distribution network you can get.
[01:37:21.231 --> 01:37:23.171]  We've been doing tests the last three weeks.
[01:37:23.412 --> 01:37:26.672]  All the PrisonPlanet.tv videos you've been seeing have been off that.
[01:37:26.692 --> 01:37:29.993]  We're talking about four times T1 speed downloads.
[01:37:30.689 --> 01:37:32.230]  You know, if you've got a fast connection.
[01:37:32.651 --> 01:37:34.593]  Now, if you've got a bad connection, it's not going to be that fast.
[01:37:34.633 --> 01:37:40.058]  But I mean, it's just smoking, beautiful flash, beautiful windows, beautiful quick time.
[01:37:40.198 --> 01:37:42.019]  It's just almost TV quality.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:43.140]  Download them.
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:43.781]  Put them on disk.
[01:37:43.861 --> 01:37:44.562]  Give them to people.
[01:37:45.342 --> 01:37:47.424]  Now, without a distributor agreement, you cannot sell them.
[01:37:47.745 --> 01:37:54.010]  And with this film, if I catch people taking knockoffs and selling it for a couple bucks, we have to stop you.
[01:37:54.471 --> 01:37:56.873]  Because I've got a distributor putting them in stores and
[01:37:57.944 --> 01:38:04.709]  Frankly, we don't sell a tenth as many because everybody's giving them out and making copies and selling them.
[01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:19.158]  And so it's frankly, I've come to the point of a film gets so expensive to make when you buy the footage and you buy all the music and you do everything kosher and you, you know, do it all proper and flying around the world and all this, where I'll probably never make the money back even if I did that.
[01:38:19.699 --> 01:38:21.039]  I mean, it's a literal love affair.
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.320]  All right, I'm going to shut up.
[01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:23.021]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:38:23.441 --> 01:38:26.243]  Mike Rivero is holding, I apologize for babbling for five minutes.
[01:38:27.264 --> 01:38:27.684]  It's about
[01:38:28.419 --> 01:38:37.349]  We're going to have it come back to the Alamo Draft House here in Austin on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of this month, and then on the 4th, 5th, and 6th in November.
[01:38:37.369 --> 01:38:38.270]  And then that is it.
[01:38:38.370 --> 01:38:38.790]  It's over.
[01:38:39.531 --> 01:38:41.874]  Okay, so if you want to get your tickets, it always sells out.
[01:38:42.394 --> 01:38:43.636]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:38:43.656 --> 01:38:47.019]  We've got links over there so you can go ahead and get your tickets and come to those showings this month and next month.
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:48.361]  Alright, Mike Rivera.
[01:38:49.395 --> 01:38:55.920]  Speaking of support, what really happened needs support, and I don't just have you on here for your great views on things.
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:39:00.323]  I always enjoy having you on, but I also want to tell folks about your Saturday show.
[01:39:00.623 --> 01:39:01.504]  Tell people about that.
[01:39:02.644 --> 01:39:07.548]  Well, as you point out, I have a radio show Saturday mornings on the GCN Network.
[01:39:07.588 --> 01:39:09.129]  It runs from 11 a.m.
[01:39:09.149 --> 01:39:09.709]  to 1 p.m.
[01:39:09.749 --> 01:39:13.612]  Central Time, and we have a number of very interesting guests.
[01:39:14.667 --> 01:39:18.848]  We're probably, this coming Saturday, we're going to have Bob Watata on again.
[01:39:19.228 --> 01:39:20.088]  Apparently the U.S.
[01:39:20.148 --> 01:39:24.029]  Army is again moving forward with a court-martial against Lt.
[01:39:24.109 --> 01:39:24.849]  Aaron Watata.
[01:39:25.609 --> 01:39:27.590]  This basically amounts to double jeopardy.
[01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:36.852]  And I heard on NPR this morning, in between all the global warming, global attacks, feudalism, slave news, literal slavery, that they're looking for 25 years plus
[01:39:38.809 --> 01:39:44.711]  Yeah, absolutely, and of course this is an attempt to send a message to the troops because what Aaron Watana has done...
[01:39:45.605 --> 01:39:54.052]  ...is basically what the Uniform Code of Military Justice says that soldiers are allowed to do, and that is to refuse an order they believe to be illegal or immoral.
[01:39:54.292 --> 01:40:02.458]  This goes all the way back to the Nuremberg Trials, when all the Nazis were saying, well, you can't prosecute me for the terrible things I did because I was just following orders.
[01:40:02.838 --> 01:40:11.544]  And coming out of that, there was a principle saying that soldiers can be held liable for illegal and immoral orders, and coincident with that, soldiers in the U.S.
[01:40:11.584 --> 01:40:13.506]  military were given the legal right
[01:40:13.846 --> 01:40:17.788]  to refuse illegal and immoral orders and that's what Lieutenant Watada did.
[01:40:18.228 --> 01:40:32.634]  Now the military is trying to go back on their word and they're trying to make an example out of it because otherwise you're going to have two-thirds of the military already aware that this war is illegal and that they're being asked to commit acts which are war crimes.
[01:40:35.672 --> 01:40:37.393]  What do you think of the whole... Where do you see the Blackwater situation?
[01:40:37.413 --> 01:40:39.014]  I mean, even the Puppet over there...
[01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:56.371]  Makia says, the President says, get Blackwater out.
[01:40:56.391 --> 01:40:57.891]  They're just mowing crowds down.
[01:40:58.631 --> 01:41:07.132]  There's all these videos getting released by contractors, you can't see their faces, where they just sit there shooting cars off the highway for fun, making fun of families they kill.
[01:41:07.452 --> 01:41:11.173]  I mean, you couldn't buy worse PR for our troops.
[01:41:11.213 --> 01:41:12.693]  This is getting our troops killed.
[01:41:13.033 --> 01:41:19.234]  What the contractors and not just Blackwater are doing is causing more resistance, exactly what the Pentagon actually wants.
[01:41:20.075 --> 01:41:22.155]  I mean, where do you see the Blackwater situation going?
[01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:27.493]  Well, obviously, since the Pentagon just gave them a whole brand new contract, they're not going anywhere.
[01:41:27.513 --> 01:41:28.434]  They're going to stay in Iraq.
[01:41:28.554 --> 01:41:30.455]  And they've now been paid 700 plus mil.
[01:41:31.396 --> 01:41:35.519]  Yeah, and they're going to just go on continuing to do these kind of actions.
[01:41:35.599 --> 01:41:45.286]  And as you say, this is really what the Pentagon wants, because the ultimate aim isn't to try and calm things down in Iraq, but to explode them to the point where they can justify breaking Iraq
[01:41:45.954 --> 01:41:49.256]  And how do we know that?
[01:41:49.356 --> 01:41:55.800]  Official Israeli, official U.S., official statements, P-2-O-G, Pentagon office.
[01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:57.521]  I mean, they have stated this.
[01:41:58.624 --> 01:41:59.985]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:00.085 --> 01:42:03.729]  They want to break Iraq into little tiny pieces that will never be a threat to Israel.
[01:42:04.049 --> 01:42:06.731]  And once we're in Iran, they're going to try and do the same thing with that.
[01:42:07.052 --> 01:42:09.654]  And then once we're in Saudi Arabia, they'll try and do it with that.
[01:42:09.914 --> 01:42:18.342]  And it's all about breaking the Middle East into little tiny pieces that can't stand up to Israel, so that Israel and its cultural national paranoia will feel safe.
[01:42:18.362 --> 01:42:19.823]  Of course, that's never really going to happen.
[01:42:21.295 --> 01:42:27.519]  Now, I mean, obviously, it's Siamese twins, and folks, I've always criticized Israel for government-sponsored terror.
[01:42:27.559 --> 01:42:29.360]  They admit it in the Haraj, Jerusalem Post.
[01:42:30.074 --> 01:42:33.696]  But to break this down, the oil companies, and James Baker and Bush Jr.
[01:42:33.716 --> 01:42:39.058]  like to act like Bush and the neocons, ran off the reservation and did this all on their own.
[01:42:39.418 --> 01:42:47.722]  But really, the oil companies, to suppress oil being pumped and to drive up prices, actually did give tacit approval to all of this.
[01:42:47.782 --> 01:42:49.983]  And so there are other big players at the table.
[01:42:50.263 --> 01:42:55.445]  But it is Israel, publicly, literally frothing at the head of the line, demanding
[01:42:56.145 --> 01:42:56.546]  I think so.
[01:43:14.844 --> 01:43:17.686]  There are a lot of overlapping agendas in every war.
[01:43:17.746 --> 01:43:19.627]  No war has ever fought for just one reason.
[01:43:20.147 --> 01:43:31.933]  Oil is definitely part of it, and as you say, the real goal is to shut off oil production, to drive up prices, rather than acquire the oil, because we could have bought the oil from Iraq for one-tenth of what we're spending to conquer it.
[01:43:32.313 --> 01:43:35.935]  So, you know, that aspect never really made a heck of a lot of sense.
[01:43:35.955 --> 01:43:37.196]  Well, we have oil company memos.
[01:43:37.336 --> 01:43:39.237]  They were mad at him in 1990 for over-pumping.
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.741]  Yeah, very much so.
[01:43:41.981 --> 01:43:45.024]  And, again, that is part of the issue.
[01:43:45.044 --> 01:44:01.916]  We go back and look at the UNOCAL working group that went before Congress, I think it was in 1994, where Hamid Karzai said, you know, we have to replace the government in Afghanistan in order to get our oil out of the Caspian Basin.
[01:44:02.197 --> 01:44:06.620]  And, of course, now Hamid Karzai is now the installed leader of Afghanistan.
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:17.609]  So, oil is definitely a big part of it, but if you look at the statements coming out of official Israel for the last several years, it is very clear that they are cheerleading these wars on.
[01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:22.753]  The Israeli Defense Minister is now screaming at the UN, you must go take care of Iran for us.
[01:44:22.954 --> 01:44:26.617]  Well, it would be wrong, and it would be deceptive, and we didn't just admit it.
[01:44:27.137 --> 01:44:43.151]  I mean, when you've got the former Israeli Prime Minister and all these other leaders saying, we run America, and then we're not supposed to sit here and repeat what they say, we're bad if we do, it's just unbelievable.
[01:44:44.192 --> 01:44:53.620]  Well, it is, and fortunately, of course, people are becoming more and more aware of it, and that's why this whole thing about the Israeli lobby and Walton Mearsheim's book is up to, like, the top ten on Amazon.
[01:44:54.418 --> 01:45:02.321]  And APAC has basically been reduced to screaming, we don't have any influence on America and we'll wreck the career of anybody who says we do.
[01:45:03.121 --> 01:45:10.103]  And because they're forced to be obvious and call attention to their activities, it really is working against them.
[01:45:10.163 --> 01:45:12.364]  Have you noticed you don't hear from the ADL anymore?
[01:45:13.645 --> 01:45:22.127]  Well, he's making a little bit of noise, but nobody's paying attention to him anymore because they kind of shot themselves down with their own spy scandal a few years back.
[01:45:22.648 --> 01:45:23.688]  Well, listen.
[01:45:24.431 --> 01:45:27.252]  You know, we talk about how they want to factionalize, get the blacks against the whites.
[01:45:27.272 --> 01:45:31.793]  I mean, obviously, 50 plus percent of those in Israel, I just want to make this clear, are against the war.
[01:45:32.153 --> 01:45:33.933]  It is a military dictatorship.
[01:45:34.193 --> 01:45:35.594]  They don't have freedom of the press there.
[01:45:35.614 --> 01:45:38.834]  That's why I can't believe they admit in their papers that Israel stages terror.
[01:45:39.515 --> 01:45:52.278]  I just, when you look at the long-term strategia, you know, this is all part of the New World Order to take on those sovereign nations to begin with, and that Israel is happy to play the part of the attack dog.
[01:45:52.398 --> 01:45:53.298]  I just want people
[01:45:53.678 --> 01:46:02.867]  You know, to force everyone into this, kind of like the farmer has his dog, the collie that herds the sheep.
[01:46:03.027 --> 01:46:05.249]  I really see Israel in that position.
[01:46:05.309 --> 01:46:09.093]  And it doesn't take away from Israel's culpability in the leadership there.
[01:46:10.134 --> 01:46:13.557]  Again, it's like if you have three guys robbing a bank, they're all three just as guilty.
[01:46:13.597 --> 01:46:15.840]  People always want to say it's this group or that group.
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:18.062]  We have across the board
[01:46:18.892 --> 01:46:23.856]  The global leadership now in France and Europe and here in the United States.
[01:46:24.656 --> 01:46:26.798]  Russia isn't putting up much of a fight against this.
[01:46:27.719 --> 01:46:29.600]  China is knee-deep in the New World Order.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:42.149]  I mean, I just think they've all got each other's hands in each other's pockets with these global corporations to the point, Mike, that it just seems like it's just all going over an edge no matter what we do.
[01:46:43.286 --> 01:46:54.209]  Well, I know that's very frustrating, and unfortunately a lot of people are still trying to do protests and petitions because they think it's going to change anything, and it really isn't, not with the elections as badly compromised as they are.
[01:46:54.830 --> 01:47:09.314]  And I really hate to think of the possibility that we are heading to a new world war, but it's inescapable that our current administration is following pretty much the same blueprint that Hitler did to start World War II.
[01:47:09.354 --> 01:47:12.195]  We've had fake terror attacks... And they know it's... Go ahead.
[01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:20.508]  Yeah, and we've got these fake attacks to justify invading countries that haven't done anything to us, and everybody...
[01:47:21.973 --> 01:47:35.356]  Hitler led Germany into complete and utter disaster, so it boggles the mind why George Bush is following that same blueprint, knowing that historically it's going to lead to the destruction of the United States.
[01:47:35.456 --> 01:47:46.799]  Because the Milner Group, this is in Carol Quigley's book, it's in other mainstream documents, the Milner Group that headed up the Bank of England by the twenties was funding all of the quote right-wing
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:48.281]  We're good to go.
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:09.341]  Uh, while using us to set up the One World Government.
[01:48:09.401 --> 01:48:17.022]  That's why you have the Federal Reserve and the whole leadership bad-mouthing the dollar right now, and bad-mouthing housing prices, the cash sink, as you say.
[01:48:17.483 --> 01:48:32.766]  I mean, they're doing everything they can in actions to really destroy this country, and I see it as the same operation of the Milner Group in helping install Hitler and bring him to power, right through buying up all the groups, to picking him and putting him in and
[01:48:33.647 --> 01:48:35.530]  Yeah, it is, and there's a lot of globalists very much in play.
[01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:38.334]  But, you know, it's hard to say that there's a single unified
[01:48:51.624 --> 01:48:54.247]  Control over current world events.
[01:48:54.327 --> 01:48:59.932]  We have a lot of warring factions, and I'm seeing an increase in the factionalization even within the US government itself.
[01:48:59.972 --> 01:49:05.837]  But we're not seeing factionalization on the global tax, which again isn't just going to be oil and fuel.
[01:49:06.098 --> 01:49:13.064]  They're saying on big houses, on cars, on home inspections, people running your life.
[01:49:13.304 --> 01:49:14.826]  We're seeing unification there, brother.
[01:49:15.914 --> 01:49:21.677]  Well, we absolutely are, and it's all about another global tax, and it's all about another global control of our lives.
[01:49:22.417 --> 01:49:32.743]  And, you know, again, this whole thing about global warming, they're taking a natural occurring event, and they're turning it into a crisis that justifies taxation.
[01:49:32.803 --> 01:49:33.123]  Stay there.
[01:49:33.143 --> 01:49:35.524]  I want to get your analysis on that when we get back.
[01:49:35.584 --> 01:49:36.564]  And we're going to go to your calls.
[01:49:36.605 --> 01:49:39.966]  I'll keep Mike over a little bit, and we'll get Curt Nemo on here.
[01:49:39.986 --> 01:49:43.628]  He's setting up our new website, truthnews.us.
[01:49:56.694 --> 01:49:57.175]  It's here!
[01:49:57.375 --> 01:50:02.159]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.519 --> 01:50:10.145]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.839 --> 01:50:17.902]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.302 --> 01:50:29.707]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.027 --> 01:50:33.609]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.949 --> 01:50:35.930]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.250 --> 01:50:40.112]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:53:35.177 --> 01:53:38.959]  I'm going to get your take on the whole push for the global tax.
[01:53:39.379 --> 01:53:41.401]  Who's up first here in this big call list we've got?
[01:53:43.297 --> 01:53:45.059]  Mark in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[01:53:45.079 --> 01:53:45.859]  You're on the air, Mark.
[01:53:45.879 --> 01:53:46.260]  Go ahead.
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:47.681]  Hey, Alex.
[01:53:47.701 --> 01:53:48.582]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:53:48.942 --> 01:53:49.222]  Welcome.
[01:53:49.803 --> 01:53:49.903]  Hi.
[01:53:50.043 --> 01:53:51.985]  I want to go over a few things on the police state.
[01:53:53.326 --> 01:54:08.058]  In Las Vegas, Nevada, the public schools, like high school, they've got a thing set up where when you enroll in a school, your child has to agree to be interviewed by a military recruiter before they graduate.
[01:54:08.879 --> 01:54:10.841]  And if they try to opt out of that,
[01:54:11.397 --> 01:54:14.820]  They'll be rejected from having their picture show up in the yearbook.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.923]  Yeah, that's nationwide, and that's federal funding doing that.
[01:54:18.963 --> 01:54:20.163]  Mike Rivero, tell them about it.
[01:54:20.804 --> 01:54:34.154]  Well, obviously, I mean, the whole idea is to, you know, at every possible opportunity, get the children into the hands of the recruiters who will say and do and promise anything to get them to sign up for a stint in the military.
[01:54:34.234 --> 01:54:36.956]  They've been caught across the country threatening them with jail!
[01:54:38.143 --> 01:54:39.164]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:54:39.384 --> 01:54:45.651]  And there have been numerous cases where people will sign up for the military and they do not get the benefits that they've been promised.
[01:54:45.671 --> 01:54:47.493]  They do not get the positions they've been promised.
[01:54:48.113 --> 01:54:54.019]  And the courts have repeatedly ruled that any promises military recruiters make are not legally enforceable.
[01:54:54.700 --> 01:55:00.486]  And this is a message parents need to give to their kids before their kids get taken before these military recruiters.
[01:55:01.019 --> 01:55:12.907]  Is that these recruiters will lie, they do lie, and you cannot take anything that they say on face value, because after all, they work for a government that we know lied us into a war in Iraq.
[01:55:13.487 --> 01:55:21.633]  And, uh, you know, unfortunately... By the way, by the way, if you think you're getting Social Security in the next ten years, I mean, by ten years from now, they're admitting nothing.
[01:55:22.073 --> 01:55:25.235]  If you think you're getting benefits, this whole thing's gonna collapse, folks.
[01:55:27.242 --> 01:55:28.043]  It absolutely is.
[01:55:28.183 --> 01:55:32.246]  I mean, the Clinton administration looted Social Security to create their budget surplus.
[01:55:32.606 --> 01:55:44.736]  There's nothing in there but IOUs, and now that the baby boomers are starting to retire, the Social Security fund is just completely stressed out, and they don't have the money that's in there to really pay the benefits they've promised.
[01:55:44.976 --> 01:55:49.280]  And they're already talking about cutting benefits and cutting benefits because of the Social Security crisis.
[01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:53.443]  And it's kind of this weird cycle, because Greenspan
[01:55:54.448 --> 01:56:16.152]  You know, used the cash built up in Social Security before Clinton looted it as a justification, I'm sorry, he raised Social Security taxes because of the baby boomers, and then they turn around and they say, well look at all this extra money we've got in there, we can give tax cuts to the rich, then the tax cuts create a huge deficit, and then they say, oh, we're out of money, we've got to cut Social Security benefits.
[01:56:16.532 --> 01:56:19.092]  So it's a really crooked deal all the way around.
[01:56:19.112 --> 01:56:19.613]  It's amazing.
[01:56:19.653 --> 01:56:21.853]  Anything else from Vegas there, Mark?
[01:56:22.646 --> 01:56:33.531]  Yes Alex, the other thing is, there was a law that the state legislature put through a few months ago that gave full police powers to school crossing guards.
[01:56:34.431 --> 01:56:40.434]  They have full power as a regular police officer, they can arrest, they'll sit there with radar guns, they can give you tickets.
[01:56:42.446 --> 01:56:45.108]  They've done this in New York, they've done this in London.
[01:56:45.408 --> 01:56:52.474]  Another sign of police state is a subgrade of tattletale, revenue-raising, semi-cop.
[01:56:52.534 --> 01:56:52.795]  Mike?
[01:56:53.735 --> 01:57:03.804]  Yeah, basically it's informants and snitches, and while we've had covert informants in the United States, I mean, the FBI has them on every college campus to keep watch on student activism.
[01:57:03.844 --> 01:57:06.026]  Now they're creating public corps of them!
[01:57:06.733 --> 01:57:08.274]  Yeah, just like the Nazis did.
[01:57:08.314 --> 01:57:09.535]  Isn't that kind of amazing?
[01:57:09.555 --> 01:57:13.957]  You know, the little snitch who would go and run and tell the Nazis about everything that was going on.
[01:57:14.337 --> 01:57:20.841]  And it's just a device to keep us all afraid from speaking out, because the person next to us might be a snitch for the government.
[01:57:20.881 --> 01:57:21.802]  Yeah, I got an idea.
[01:57:21.842 --> 01:57:23.903]  Let's put everybody on a list, New World Order.
[01:57:24.984 --> 01:57:26.264]  How about everybody just get on it?
[01:57:26.604 --> 01:57:27.225]  You criminals?
[01:57:27.765 --> 01:57:29.986]  Then we'll know who the bad guys are, those that aren't on the list.
[01:57:30.267 --> 01:57:30.907]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.607 --> 01:57:38.628]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.648 --> 01:57:38.848]  Hello?
[01:57:38.868 --> 01:57:39.348]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.368 --> 01:57:40.229]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:40.269 --> 01:57:41.009]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:41.049 --> 01:57:42.609]  You want answers?
[01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:45.670]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.669 --> 01:58:01.332]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.853 --> 01:58:05.956]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:12.962 --> 01:58:14.723]  Michael Rivero is our guest.
[01:58:14.763 --> 01:58:16.625]  He'll be with us until the 20 after mark.
[01:58:16.645 --> 01:58:17.585]  Appreciate him joining us.
[01:58:18.226 --> 01:58:25.312]  Coming in on the next segment to cross over with him is Kurt Nimmo, a great online columnist syndicated all over the web.
[01:58:26.505 --> 01:58:32.268]  We're now on the team as the editor-in-chief over at TruthNews.us.
[01:58:32.308 --> 01:58:35.209]  We have launched another frigate in the InfoWars.
[01:58:35.229 --> 01:58:40.791]  It'll have a lot of the same news you see on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.net, but it'll have a lot of news you don't see.
[01:58:41.511 --> 01:58:45.693]  And it is another auxiliary in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:58:46.714 --> 01:58:49.955]  Let's talk to Aaron in Canada.
[01:58:49.975 --> 01:58:51.476]  You're on the air with Michael Rivera.
[01:58:51.516 --> 01:58:51.836]  Go ahead.
[01:58:53.306 --> 01:58:55.447]  Alex, it's nice to meet you and speak with you again.
[01:58:55.467 --> 01:58:55.827]  How are you?
[01:58:56.168 --> 01:58:56.788]  Nice to talk to you.
[01:58:56.808 --> 01:58:57.368]  What's on your mind?
[01:58:58.008 --> 01:59:05.012]  I just update you on the government conspiracy against my family and I. We talked about the airline profiling attack, the secret trial we've been through.
[01:59:05.052 --> 01:59:07.613]  I remember you were a guest on the show.
[01:59:07.653 --> 01:59:09.334]  It was in the Canadian papers.
[01:59:09.354 --> 01:59:10.895]  They half beat you to death.
[01:59:11.315 --> 01:59:11.635]  That's right.
[01:59:11.896 --> 01:59:12.656]  And then you didn't do it.
[01:59:12.696 --> 01:59:13.656]  I'm not finished with the job yet.
[01:59:14.077 --> 01:59:15.337]  And then now they're ruining your life.
[01:59:15.698 --> 01:59:17.418]  Well, I mean, that's what happens now.
[01:59:17.719 --> 01:59:19.840]  I'm in lockdown in my home right now.
[01:59:20.882 --> 01:59:27.826]  After they put us through the secret trial, sent us back on the no-fly list, and we found out that they were all criminals, I did a little bit of online work.
[01:59:27.866 --> 01:59:29.567]  I found out the judge has charges against him.
[01:59:29.647 --> 01:59:31.228]  That's Judge David S. Doty.
[01:59:32.348 --> 01:59:34.389]  AaronJamesStory.com is my website.
[01:59:34.429 --> 01:59:37.929]  That's A-A-R-O-N-J-A-M-E-S-S-T-O-R-Y-dot-C-O-M.
[01:59:37.949 --> 01:59:45.031]  You can find the charges on him by going to... No, you've got to know, though, there's so many victims that we generally can only have a victim on once or twice.
[01:59:45.051 --> 01:59:47.332]  Like, I had this lady who had her daughter's arm broken.
[01:59:47.712 --> 01:59:49.372]  She's facing felony charges.
[01:59:50.132 --> 01:59:53.913]  So, you've been asking to come back on, and I'd love to have you back on.
[01:59:54.173 --> 02:00:01.675]  The problem is that there's so many victims, exactly, that we can only have a victim on once or twice.
[02:00:01.775 --> 02:00:02.735]  Right, I understand that.
[02:00:02.815 --> 02:00:08.257]  Like, we've got CPS murdering people's children and we can only have them on watch because they're murdering so many.
[02:00:08.557 --> 02:00:08.777]  Yes.
[02:00:09.277 --> 02:00:10.937]  So I'm going to cut to the crux of this right now.
[02:00:11.818 --> 02:00:28.902]  After exposing the judges, corrupt the jury pool, three independent articles with collusion between prosecution and judges and the judiciary, after exposing much of the material that you have on my site and finding out that they're all basically criminals and exposing the charges against them at Henry Penn in Minneapolis, they don't like me very much and so they've
[02:00:29.733 --> 02:00:30.013]  I don't
[02:00:53.605 --> 02:01:02.487]  I'm going to let you go.
[02:01:02.507 --> 02:01:04.007]  I'm going to let you go now.
[02:01:04.568 --> 02:01:09.829]  I wanted to be able to give your URL out, but I understand they're setting you up, and they do a lot of this.
[02:01:10.209 --> 02:01:13.430]  Look, most of the radical Islamist sites are government-run.
[02:01:13.450 --> 02:01:18.311]  They even have former ADL, you know, chieftains' sons running them, claiming they're with Al-Qaeda now.
[02:01:18.751 --> 02:01:19.791]  You want to comment on that, Mike?
[02:01:20.603 --> 02:01:25.626]  Yeah, there's a lot of these fake sites that are being set up to try and create a bad public image.
[02:01:25.946 --> 02:01:30.690]  And again, this goes back to stunts the FBI used to pull in the 60s against the anti-war movement.
[02:01:31.090 --> 02:01:39.115]  It goes back to this Adam the American, who's supposed to be an American, Al-Qaeda, and he's actually the grandson of an ADL board member.
[02:01:40.094 --> 02:01:42.075]  There's a lot of deception going on out there.
[02:01:42.135 --> 02:01:44.535]  As Sun Tzu says, all war begins with deception.
[02:01:44.775 --> 02:01:51.237]  And what that means is the leader who wants to start a war has to lie his people into it, because otherwise they're not going to go.
[02:01:51.517 --> 02:01:54.498]  Tell that Black Panther story, because that's admitted mainstream news.
[02:01:54.538 --> 02:01:55.558]  We have the comic books.
[02:01:55.939 --> 02:01:56.659]  They're online.
[02:01:56.719 --> 02:01:57.379]  Explain what they did.
[02:01:58.190 --> 02:02:06.825]  Okay, back in the 60s, when the Civil Rights Movement was really beginning to crank up and Martin Luther King was beginning to say to the black people, you know, why are you going to Vietnam?
[02:02:06.865 --> 02:02:09.309]  Because, you know, you're being preferentially put in harm's way.
[02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:11.292]  There was a group called the Black Panthers.
[02:02:11.332 --> 02:02:12.514]  Now, when they started out,
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:14.320]  They were very pacifist.
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:16.701]  They were worried about breakfast for the ghetto kids.
[02:02:16.741 --> 02:02:25.044]  They were concerned about local control of school curriculum so that the community decided what the kids were being taught and not the federal government.
[02:02:25.445 --> 02:02:28.346]  Well, they started becoming very influential and very prominent.
[02:02:28.406 --> 02:02:29.366]  Finish the story.
[02:02:29.386 --> 02:02:30.026]  Finish the story.
[02:02:30.046 --> 02:02:31.687]  We're going to break it down on the other side.
[02:02:33.227 --> 02:02:34.888]  They will get feds to join groups.
[02:02:34.908 --> 02:02:37.329]  They'll get you to carry guns around, shoot your mouth off.
[02:02:38.326 --> 02:02:40.530]  You'll be being led by feds when they do that.
[02:02:41.091 --> 02:02:43.194]  We'll be right back with Mike Rivero and Curt Nemo!
[02:02:46.551 --> 02:02:55.638]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTVE to below detectable limits.
[02:02:55.878 --> 02:03:07.106]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:03:07.447 --> 02:03:13.151]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:03:13.491 --> 02:03:13.872]  I think?
[02:03:31.527 --> 02:03:33.128]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[02:03:33.168 --> 02:03:34.029]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[02:03:34.069 --> 02:03:34.369]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:03:34.429 --> 02:03:35.831]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:03:48.465 --> 02:03:51.627]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:03:51.987 --> 02:03:53.929]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:54.289 --> 02:04:01.934]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.617 --> 02:04:09.660]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:10.060 --> 02:04:21.465]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.805 --> 02:04:25.487]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.747 --> 02:04:27.688]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:28.028 --> 02:04:31.870]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:45.256 --> 02:04:46.817]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.
[02:04:47.097 --> 02:04:52.619]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[02:04:53.079 --> 02:05:00.983]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[02:05:01.503 --> 02:05:05.145]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs.
[02:05:05.465 --> 02:05:09.106]  Two books that combined are over a thousand pages and other information.
[02:05:09.386 --> 02:05:12.527]  Order now at our website mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[02:05:12.728 --> 02:05:16.689]  That's mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[02:05:16.969 --> 02:05:21.651]  The last word monastery is spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y or call us at 1-800-275-1126.
[02:05:21.671 --> 02:05:21.871]  That's 1-800-275-1126.
[02:05:29.154 --> 02:05:30.234]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:54.518 --> 02:05:57.080]  Kurt Nemo is our guest of the balance of this hour.
[02:05:57.101 --> 02:06:01.905]  I want to talk to Chris, Richard, David, others, callers that are holding.
[02:06:02.385 --> 02:06:08.410]  We've got Mike Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com with us for a few more minutes as well.
[02:06:09.872 --> 02:06:11.813]  Kurt heads up another day in the empire.
[02:06:13.395 --> 02:06:21.062]  He heads up KurtNemo.com and now he is the editor, the man running the show.
[02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:29.626]  Over at my new website, it's all part of the team's website, over at truthnews.us.
[02:06:29.946 --> 02:06:34.350]  But I want to talk about that after Mike Rivera leaves us here in about 12 minutes.
[02:06:34.370 --> 02:06:40.174]  I wanted to let you guys talk about things that are happening right now and also get into a few other topics.
[02:06:40.614 --> 02:06:43.016]  But let me first welcome Kurt to the show.
[02:06:43.076 --> 02:06:43.997]  Kurt, thanks for coming on.
[02:06:44.497 --> 02:06:44.938]  Hey Alex.
[02:06:46.079 --> 02:06:48.060]  It is really exciting to have you on the team now.
[02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:48.941]  Great!
[02:06:50.334 --> 02:06:53.676]  I am looking forward to the things we're going to do in the fight against the globalists.
[02:06:54.396 --> 02:06:54.896]  Definitely.
[02:06:57.778 --> 02:06:58.238]  Where are you?
[02:06:58.338 --> 02:06:59.739]  Well, we'll talk about it later.
[02:07:00.279 --> 02:07:02.900]  Right now, I meant to ask this question of Mike.
[02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:05.622]  He never had time to finish it before we had a break, but let me ask you first.
[02:07:06.242 --> 02:07:13.846]  The incredible hype about global taxation, global regulation, a new wave of bureaucrats to run our daily lives.
[02:07:14.086 --> 02:07:16.247]  I mean, they're really pushing the carbon tax right now.
[02:07:16.907 --> 02:07:18.008]  What's your take on all that?
[02:07:19.099 --> 02:07:22.201]  Well, it's just more of the whole plan that they're rolling out on us.
[02:07:22.241 --> 02:07:32.507]  You notice that in L.A., the city council just earlier this week, or actually it was last week, told the subjects of L.A.
[02:07:33.007 --> 02:07:39.752]  that they have to turn off their lights now one hour a week to save energy for the so-called climate crisis.
[02:07:40.452 --> 02:07:42.873]  So, you know, it's just more of the same.
[02:07:42.913 --> 02:07:43.874]  They'll continue this.
[02:07:44.174 --> 02:07:45.215]  They'll increase the tempo.
[02:07:46.184 --> 02:07:49.791]  And they'll just want to acclimate people to give up their rights and...
[02:07:51.092 --> 02:07:53.032]  You know, for the sake of climate change.
[02:07:53.112 --> 02:07:57.773]  And by the way, they admit, I read stuff from 30 years ago about, oh, we're going to do recycling.
[02:07:58.233 --> 02:08:05.235]  But instead of just having you go dump it down the street or, you know, give it to a recycler, we're going to make them all separated out, even though we've got machines that do that.
[02:08:05.695 --> 02:08:09.936]  It's a ritual to then habitualize so that it's on their mind.
[02:08:10.176 --> 02:08:14.357]  And when they make you turn and they say, well, we're asking you to, but then it always becomes mandatory.
[02:08:14.777 --> 02:08:16.137]  Turn your lights off for an hour.
[02:08:16.417 --> 02:08:18.518]  That's to give it the illusion of being real.
[02:08:18.558 --> 02:08:20.098]  It turned out, and I spotted this.
[02:08:20.579 --> 02:08:22.447]  Early on, of course, it turned out to be true.
[02:08:22.467 --> 02:08:23.050]  It wasn't hard.
[02:08:24.222 --> 02:08:44.358]  Enron, when they were stealing over a billion dollars a week over that summer and into the fall in California, it turned out, A, they had plenty of power, and B, they would turn the power off on purpose because then they found people would believe that doubling and tripling of prices was okay, creating artificial scarcity.
[02:08:44.699 --> 02:08:49.623]  The IMF and World Bank documents that Joseph Stiglitz got out in 2002 had the same thing.
[02:08:49.663 --> 02:08:53.446]  In Argentina and other areas, they would turn the water off before tripling it.
[02:08:53.666 --> 02:08:55.990]  They turned it off for a week to get you where you appreciated it.
[02:08:56.511 --> 02:08:57.433]  They would close the road.
[02:08:57.453 --> 02:09:01.420]  I mean, they would just claim it was down for construction before they doubled the toll.
[02:09:01.761 --> 02:09:04.306]  This is a basic psychological operation.
[02:09:04.566 --> 02:09:05.888]  Mike Rivera, you want to comment on that?
[02:09:06.528 --> 02:09:07.749]  Yeah, absolutely it's true.
[02:09:07.809 --> 02:09:13.791]  And when I lived in Southern California, I remember they were doing the big heyday about, we must all conserve water, we must all conserve water.
[02:09:13.851 --> 02:09:18.133]  And everybody started doing all the little tricks, the little bottles in the toilets and all the rest of it.
[02:09:18.393 --> 02:09:22.655]  And we conserve so much water, the water department came back and said, we're losing money here.
[02:09:22.695 --> 02:09:23.856]  We need a rate increase.
[02:09:24.236 --> 02:09:26.377]  You know, to get our revenue back up to where it was.
[02:09:26.697 --> 02:09:34.619]  So it was really, it was just all about, you know, scaring people into agreeing to make due with less so that the government and corporations can have more.
[02:09:34.859 --> 02:09:42.380]  By the way, the big corporate council in Canada just called for more higher taxes and regulations on everybody.
[02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:46.361]  Now what does that tell you when the big corporate councils want this?
[02:09:46.561 --> 02:09:51.663]  They're going to take that tax money and it's going to go right into the government investments they make with corporations.
[02:09:52.063 --> 02:09:52.903]  Kurt Nemo, comments?
[02:09:53.638 --> 02:09:56.300]  Well, you know, you've uncovered that pretty well.
[02:09:56.340 --> 02:10:04.144]  I didn't know, I didn't realize to the extent that the local governments were, you know, taking money and sticking it in their own bank accounts.
[02:10:04.324 --> 02:10:22.155]  And, you know, so the point being that this is just another scam, another way to get us, as you said, trained so that we're good subjects, so that we accept this, you know, the impending so-called climate crisis that they're going to impose on us, which is basically just another control mechanism that they have for us.
[02:10:22.919 --> 02:10:28.522]  Mike, they had their Earth Summit and all these rock concerts.
[02:10:29.322 --> 02:10:31.423]  It was about half the attendance they said they'd have.
[02:10:31.964 --> 02:10:34.885]  It was a big failure on raising money, but it doesn't matter.
[02:10:34.965 --> 02:10:44.910]  I mean, I'm hearing local conservative news stations now saying, man-made global warming is real, we must make all these changes, and they're just doing it.
[02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:46.531]  Bush is now saying it's real.
[02:10:46.851 --> 02:10:48.071]  I mean, they're not playing games.
[02:10:48.111 --> 02:10:49.052]  Where do you see this going?
[02:10:50.158 --> 02:10:51.019]  I see this going.
[02:10:51.099 --> 02:11:00.404]  It's just another excuse to get ordinary people to have lowered lifestyles so that the rich can have that much more to fight their wars with and build their palaces with.
[02:11:00.624 --> 02:11:01.765]  I mean, look at Al Gore.
[02:11:01.805 --> 02:11:04.767]  This is the guy who's supposed to be the figurehead of the global warming movement.
[02:11:05.087 --> 02:11:08.829]  And if you look at the house he actually lives in, it is hideously wasteful.
[02:11:09.309 --> 02:11:12.891]  And if you want to talk about carbon footprint, let's look at the war in Iraq.
[02:11:12.951 --> 02:11:17.614]  I mean, how much fossil fuels are they burning up with these tanks and half-tracks?
[02:11:17.998 --> 02:11:24.473]  And Hummers and jet planes and everything that they're flying over there, you know, they're burning up vast amounts of oil fighting over the oil.
[02:11:25.109 --> 02:11:32.954]  And yet we don't see the global warmers talking about how much heat is being put into the atmosphere by all these war machines and all these explosives.
[02:11:33.115 --> 02:11:49.646]  And then there's no debate about, hey, 9,000 years ago to 6,000 years ago we had the Iberian maxim where it was 10 degrees hotter on average and there were vineyards in England and man developed the first tribal states.
[02:11:50.206 --> 02:11:52.928]  And our population exploded in polar bear numbers.
[02:11:53.609 --> 02:11:56.031]  The archaeologists show we're about double their range.
[02:11:56.651 --> 02:11:57.972]  It was further north.
[02:11:58.733 --> 02:12:01.094]  The fact that the Earth being warmer is good.
[02:12:01.555 --> 02:12:04.036]  There's no debate about that the Sun is doing it.
[02:12:04.997 --> 02:12:14.124]  Yeah, there isn't, and yet here we're hearing from all these robotic spacecraft we've sent throughout the solar system that the other planets are getting warmer by exactly the same amount as the Earth.
[02:12:14.759 --> 02:12:18.823]  And this has to tell you that the sun is really behind it all.
[02:12:18.863 --> 02:12:23.067]  I mean, we've only been able to do accurate measurements of solar output for the last 60 years.
[02:12:23.547 --> 02:12:29.313]  So the degree to which the sun is controlling temperatures in the solar system is absolutely not understood.
[02:12:29.333 --> 02:12:32.356]  Well, I'll tell you what scares me is I now have neocons.
[02:12:33.098 --> 02:12:44.041]  Who are on websites attacking me and on message boards, and they're saying, I'm an evil moron, 9-11 truther, George Bush is great, the war is great, and I'm an idiot because I don't believe in man-made global warming.
[02:12:44.401 --> 02:12:50.762]  It looks like, for those that are going to drink the Kool-Aid, liberals and conservatives, that it's now a weird, sick amalgamation.
[02:12:51.002 --> 02:12:53.003]  What would you call this group of people, Curt Nima?
[02:12:54.094 --> 02:12:57.476]  Well, I would call them, well, actually they're just going along to get along.
[02:12:57.536 --> 02:12:58.796]  I mean, they're part of the whole plan.
[02:12:59.837 --> 02:13:01.077]  Conservatives aren't conservatives.
[02:13:01.117 --> 02:13:01.958]  We realize that.
[02:13:01.998 --> 02:13:03.718]  They're just statists like the rest of them, you know?
[02:13:04.319 --> 02:13:14.663]  And as far as global warming goes, the average American is going to buy into this because they don't understand, you know, basically the dynamics of the solar system.
[02:13:15.024 --> 02:13:15.984]  And Mike's absolutely right.
[02:13:16.024 --> 02:13:20.346]  The planets are warming up and there's a lot of solar activity that's been going on for a decade or more.
[02:13:21.113 --> 02:13:24.557]  And unfortunately, the average person is going to buy into it.
[02:13:25.258 --> 02:13:26.279]  And that's real unfortunate.
[02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:34.888]  And by the way, if the sun, because they have these mini heat-ups, cools back down, they're saying it may, then they can say, oh look, we fixed it, it's cold again!
[02:13:36.503 --> 02:13:47.192]  Well, I remember back when I was a kid, they were telling us we were headed into a new ice age, and we had to follow this or that government policy and pay this additional funding to deal with that crisis.
[02:13:47.492 --> 02:13:54.038]  But it's just, you know, Michael Crichton has a book called State of Fear, in which he really tears the global warming cult apart.
[02:13:54.358 --> 02:13:59.342]  And there's this wonderful little appendix in it, in which he equates the global warming hysteria
[02:13:59.753 --> 02:14:03.015]  With the race hygiene eugenics craze of the thirties.
[02:14:03.216 --> 02:14:04.316]  No, no, that's it.
[02:14:04.356 --> 02:14:04.737]  No, no, no.
[02:14:04.757 --> 02:14:06.118]  I didn't know Creighton was doing that.
[02:14:06.158 --> 02:14:07.419]  He's also a scientist, isn't he?
[02:14:07.879 --> 02:14:09.740]  Yeah, he's a former doctor.
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:10.461]  He's a scientist.
[02:14:10.521 --> 02:14:12.002]  His books are always very well researched.
[02:14:12.022 --> 02:14:13.103]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:14:13.123 --> 02:14:14.824]  Creighton's got a book saying that?
[02:14:14.884 --> 02:14:16.105]  That's what Endgame covers.
[02:14:16.285 --> 02:14:16.906]  Tell him, Kurt.
[02:14:17.826 --> 02:14:18.907]  No, yeah, absolutely.
[02:14:18.927 --> 02:14:22.430]  You know, they're using, uh, they're pushing the eugenics with that as well.
[02:14:22.450 --> 02:14:23.891]  Wow, that's great news!
[02:14:24.011 --> 02:14:25.272]  Creighton figured that out?
[02:14:25.825 --> 02:14:27.286]  Yeah, well, the book's been out for a while.
[02:14:27.306 --> 02:14:30.609]  It's called State of Fear, and it is well worth the purchase price to read that.
[02:14:32.391 --> 02:14:33.532]  Man, that is exciting.
[02:14:33.552 --> 02:14:35.654]  You know, I'm really starting to see people figure it out.
[02:14:37.115 --> 02:14:41.579]  We always talk about this, but for you, Kurt, first, I mean, are you seeing an exponential wake-up, or what are you seeing?
[02:14:42.260 --> 02:14:45.303]  Well, I'm seeing, I'm definitely seeing people wake up to a certain extent.
[02:14:45.894 --> 02:14:58.910]  But, you know, you take a look at society in general, and while a lot of people are waking up, there's still a proportionately larger amount who are mired in this cultural narcissism that we're surrounded with, you know, this consumerism.
[02:14:59.791 --> 02:15:05.878]  I would say that it's definitely a positive trend that more people are going on the Internet to get their news.
[02:15:06.491 --> 02:15:08.572]  As opposed to just flipping on Fox TV.
[02:15:08.612 --> 02:15:16.034]  I mean, the statistics show that people are actually hunting out their news on the internet as opposed to, you know, using the corporate media.
[02:15:16.254 --> 02:15:17.395]  And it's exponential.
[02:15:18.615 --> 02:15:24.757]  In closing, both of you, Mike Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com, Curt Nemo of CurtNemo.com,
[02:15:25.749 --> 02:15:27.210]  Mike, what are they going to do?
[02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:29.851]  Because we know the credibility is imploding.
[02:15:29.931 --> 02:15:30.892]  They're in trouble everywhere.
[02:15:31.132 --> 02:15:35.014]  They're trying to widen it into a global conflagration, failing forward.
[02:15:35.434 --> 02:15:37.155]  Is that going to succeed in your estimation?
[02:15:37.355 --> 02:15:39.076]  Where is this going two years from now?
[02:15:40.597 --> 02:15:47.761]  I don't think they can succeed because people are waking up, because the alternative media is here to stay, because the Internet is here to stay.
[02:15:47.881 --> 02:15:50.122]  I know they're going to try and shut it all down.
[02:15:50.482 --> 02:15:51.223]  But you know something?
[02:15:51.343 --> 02:15:55.105]  Look at every ruler in history who has tried to create a global
[02:15:59.676 --> 02:16:08.239]  I agree with you, but back then they would at least admit they were trying to create a global empire.
[02:16:08.639 --> 02:16:12.380]  Now they openly say it, but then tell the brainwashed public it doesn't exist.
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:14.740]  I just can't get how dumb the public's gotten.
[02:16:15.741 --> 02:16:20.022]  Well, one of the things that concerns me about the public right now, and Kurt was talking about
[02:16:20.653 --> 02:16:21.354]  Consumerism.
[02:16:21.434 --> 02:16:22.255]  I don't think it's that.
[02:16:22.335 --> 02:16:36.767]  I think the portion of the public that is still very much caught up in the official story of everything tends to be the fundamentalist Christians who are hoping that if they can kick off World War III that Jesus is going to come down and invite them up to the big house.
[02:16:36.787 --> 02:16:43.393]  And they don't want to see anything that detracts from that possibility that they're finally going to get to go to that heaven that they all grew up believing.
[02:16:45.253 --> 02:16:51.035]  And that's a big part of the people who are still drinking the Kool-Aid and following George Bush and following the Democrats.
[02:16:51.075 --> 02:16:57.137]  Meanwhile, they think they're going to heaven when they support a president who puts out policies to rape children?
[02:16:58.137 --> 02:16:59.397]  Oh, but God told them to do it.
[02:17:01.298 --> 02:17:02.318]  Kurt, comments on that?
[02:17:03.879 --> 02:17:13.862]  Well, yeah, I mean, you know, the so-called Christian Zionists or the, you know, the diluted evangelical Christians who are Bush's support base,
[02:17:14.522 --> 02:17:31.446]  are most certainly deluded and that is very much necessary to forty percent thirty to forty million people in this country and that's a large block but you'll notice that they're that they're falling out from bush you know news articles have recently said that uh... they're talking about setting up a third party you know because they're disillusioned with this.
[02:17:31.486 --> 02:17:33.567]  Kurt, let's be talking about that on the other side.
[02:17:33.607 --> 02:17:35.047]  Talk about the new site you're heading up.
[02:17:35.387 --> 02:17:36.567]  Truthinews.us.
[02:17:36.807 --> 02:17:38.448]  Mike Rivera, we'll see you Saturday.
[02:17:38.488 --> 02:17:39.248]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:17:39.268 --> 02:17:40.508]  Alright, thank you.
[02:17:40.568 --> 02:17:40.908]  Bye bye.
[02:17:41.088 --> 02:17:41.569]  God bless.
[02:17:42.029 --> 02:17:42.609]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:42.649 --> 02:17:43.389]  We'll take your calls too.
[02:17:45.746 --> 02:17:50.971]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:17:51.132 --> 02:17:59.220]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:06.527]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:18:06.707 --> 02:18:07.988]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:18:08.068 --> 02:18:13.952]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:18:14.152 --> 02:18:19.236]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:18:19.356 --> 02:18:28.242]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:18:28.502 --> 02:18:31.785]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:18:33.886 --> 02:18:34.207]  We're good.
[02:18:45.881 --> 02:18:57.504]  Ted Anders from Midas, October 2nd, 2007, Gold 727, 40 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $7.50, $11.00, $3.69, $9.90 for half, $1.84, $9.95 for quarter, that's $7.50, $11.00, $3.69, $9.90, and $1.84, $9.94.
[02:18:58.944 --> 02:19:05.046]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[02:19:05.106 --> 02:19:09.487]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yuan revolution.
[02:19:09.847 --> 02:19:18.476]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[02:19:18.516 --> 02:19:21.178]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[02:19:21.458 --> 02:19:25.402]  Russia, Switzerland and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[02:19:25.622 --> 02:19:32.169]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[02:19:32.509 --> 02:19:36.112]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[02:19:36.152 --> 02:19:39.375]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[02:19:39.475 --> 02:19:39.735]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:39.755 --> 02:19:39.936]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.959 --> 02:19:47.119]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[02:19:47.219 --> 02:19:49.280]  I'm the Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:52.621]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:19:52.681 --> 02:19:53.341]  is a real thing.

[02:20:36.726 --> 02:20:39.591]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:20:46.166 --> 02:20:52.968]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two books set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:20:53.348 --> 02:20:59.750]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:21:00.211 --> 02:21:10.134]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:21:10.594 --> 02:21:14.055]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:21:14.355 --> 02:21:17.037]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[02:21:17.677 --> 02:21:20.379]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:25.223]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.
[02:21:25.263 --> 02:21:26.443]  Box 969 Soquel, S-O-Q-U-E-L, California 95073.

[02:21:30.546 --> 02:21:30.606]  1-800-544-8927.
[02:21:53.374 --> 02:21:55.655]  Curt Emhoff, prolific writer.
[02:21:56.335 --> 02:21:57.055]  Heading up.
[02:22:22.617 --> 02:22:24.038]  TruthNews.us.
[02:22:24.558 --> 02:22:35.406]  I want to get into some of the news items and take a bunch of calls here from Chris and Richard and David and Renee and Sean and others coming up in the next segment and I appreciate them holding.
[02:22:36.007 --> 02:22:44.733]  But Kurt, I'm excited and I was glad that when I called you you wanted to jump on board and head up a new site that we're really going to be expanding.
[02:22:44.753 --> 02:22:45.674]  You made it look great.
[02:22:46.274 --> 02:22:48.436]  It's packed with news and your great insight.
[02:22:48.456 --> 02:22:49.757]  We're going to be adding a lot of videos and
[02:22:50.427 --> 02:22:52.569]  Blurbs and things daily to the side as well.
[02:22:53.329 --> 02:23:00.655]  But for those that don't know who Kurt Nemo is, I would imagine 20-30% of our audience may not.
[02:23:01.656 --> 02:23:04.699]  Maybe 10% of our audience is tuning in for the first time today that know who I am.
[02:23:05.279 --> 02:23:11.404]  But tell us a little bit about yourself, Kurt, and what you do, your political awakening, and what it's been like.
[02:23:12.515 --> 02:23:16.896]  Well, my political awakening came in the late 60s.
[02:23:16.956 --> 02:23:22.478]  I'm in my 50s, so I was an anti-war activist during the late 60s, early 70s.
[02:23:22.718 --> 02:23:28.520]  And so that's pretty much when I was 20 years old, I pretty much figured out how the state works and what it does.
[02:23:28.740 --> 02:23:33.782]  And Nixon was a grand example of that, Johnson and Nixon, and the way they pursued the Vietnam War.
[02:23:34.782 --> 02:23:37.483]  So that's where my political beginning came.
[02:23:37.883 --> 02:23:41.424]  It wasn't until, like, really until Waco.
[02:23:42.073 --> 02:23:43.014]  Yeah, that's what woke me up.
[02:23:53.573 --> 02:23:59.375]  And then, the double whammy was Oklahoma City, and then I knew what was going on, and I knew that government was evil.
[02:23:59.435 --> 02:24:08.318]  I knew it was evil before, but I'd always thought that, you know, that there could be, you know, that one political party or the other, you know, espousing an ideology could fix all that.
[02:24:08.338 --> 02:24:17.061]  And then I realized, under Clinton, with Waco, that it was pretty much, it didn't matter who was in control, that these guys were all playing for the same ball team, so to speak.
[02:24:18.729 --> 02:24:19.550]  What was it like?
[02:24:19.570 --> 02:24:26.334]  I mean, did that happen overnight, or Waco happened, and then finally the last straw was the 1995 Black Op attack?
[02:24:26.755 --> 02:24:28.476]  Well, Waco was pretty much it.
[02:24:28.516 --> 02:24:31.698]  I remember very distinctly, I was doing a mundane thing.
[02:24:31.718 --> 02:24:41.204]  I was in a tire shop having my tires on my car changed, and there was a television set in the lobby showing the Inferno at Waco, and that was it.
[02:24:41.224 --> 02:24:43.566]  I just said, I couldn't believe they did this, you know?
[02:24:44.515 --> 02:24:46.396]  And that was pretty much it.
[02:24:46.516 --> 02:24:50.477]  It flipped a switch in my brain and I started thinking about stuff.
[02:24:50.537 --> 02:24:55.398]  And like I said, then a couple years later, when Oklahoma City came around, I knew it was an inside job.
[02:24:55.438 --> 02:24:59.659]  You know, the story they peddled was just total hogwash and I couldn't buy it.
[02:25:00.099 --> 02:25:01.440]  And so it was a learning process.
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:06.281]  And then, of course, obviously when 9-11 rolled around, I said, well, you know, obviously this is it.
[02:25:06.361 --> 02:25:09.362]  You know, this is Oklahoma City on steroids, you know, so.
[02:25:10.223 --> 02:25:23.534]  Um, but at that point, um, you know, prior to that, as far as where I came from, what I was doing, you know, the reason that the website looks so good is because I was, uh, involved with dot-com business in the late 90s before the so-called, uh, bubble burst on that.
[02:25:24.175 --> 02:25:33.602]  And so I took that, that stuff that I learned, uh, with that in the late 90s and translated it into my blog and now, uh, into, uh, truthnews.us.
[02:25:35.811 --> 02:25:41.336]  Well, I'm excited about the work we're going to do together and all the functions we're going to be adding for folks there at TruthNews.us.
[02:25:41.356 --> 02:25:44.659]  You also did WhatIsTheEndgame.com.
[02:25:44.699 --> 02:25:47.161]  You can also access it by EndgameTheMovie.com.
[02:25:47.482 --> 02:25:51.145]  There's banners up on TruthNews.us, InfoWars, Prison Planet.
[02:25:52.441 --> 02:25:54.902]  And a lot of people ask why I have all these sites.
[02:25:54.922 --> 02:26:01.343]  Well, each site has different articles, different flair, different angles that the writers and the editors that run them.
[02:26:01.363 --> 02:26:02.723]  Paul Watson runs Prison Planet.
[02:26:03.103 --> 02:26:06.724]  He sees things that Ryan Slickhizer and InfoWars doesn't pick up.
[02:26:07.164 --> 02:26:12.805]  They'll have the same info on all the sites, but everyday exclusive things to certain sites.
[02:26:13.485 --> 02:26:17.146]  And also, under the hack attacks and all the stuff that happens to us, we don't whine about it.
[02:26:17.779 --> 02:26:31.108]  We just intensify what we do, and if I get another real, sustained, massive attack, as soon as I have the capital, I'll start another website, and put more people in there, and try to have it be self-funding.
[02:26:31.868 --> 02:26:36.551]  Because I am not going to be deterred at what I'm doing, and that's the attitude we have to have, and that's what I like.
[02:26:36.571 --> 02:26:43.216]  You consistently, every day, write articles, consistently have great insight, but frankly, a lot of people in this movement don't have.
[02:26:43.636 --> 02:26:44.737]  It's good to be on board.
[02:26:44.757 --> 02:26:49.279]  As far as a lot of the people in the so-called movement go, I think it's pervasive in our society for this
[02:27:12.296 --> 02:27:22.925]  Sort of intellectual laziness, and I think people are too easily deterred, or give up, or don't think, and I think that's part and parcel of our social order and the educational system.
[02:27:23.506 --> 02:27:24.166]  I agree with you.
[02:27:24.186 --> 02:27:25.167]  Kurt Nimmo stayed there.
[02:27:25.187 --> 02:27:30.712]  We're gonna come back and take calls, get into a bunch of other news, and find out what Kurt thinks is most important right now.
[02:27:35.676 --> 02:27:36.637]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.077 --> 02:27:38.579]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.574 --> 02:27:42.436]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.558 --> 02:27:50.501]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming and the end of the world?
[02:27:50.821 --> 02:27:52.702]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[02:27:52.902 --> 02:27:55.944]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:27:56.124 --> 02:27:59.266]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:27:59.566 --> 02:28:01.427]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:28:01.687 --> 02:28:05.388]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:28:05.668 --> 02:28:08.329]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:28:08.949 --> 02:28:13.251]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:28:13.451 --> 02:28:17.692]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:28:18.132 --> 02:28:22.474]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[02:28:22.774 --> 02:28:27.035]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:28:27.375 --> 02:28:33.237]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[02:28:33.557 --> 02:28:35.978]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:28:36.178 --> 02:28:36.698]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:28:36.718 --> 02:28:37.799]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[02:28:47.981 --> 02:28:56.143]  So you've decided to make the switch to a healthier lifestyle, eating more organic fruits and vegetables, staying away from unhealthy snacking, and cutting out dangerous salts from your diet.
[02:28:56.403 --> 02:28:58.924]  The only problem is, you don't know how to keep it interesting.

[02:29:32.061 --> 02:29:34.663]  That's D-R-Y-I-N-G-123.com or call 1-800-875-4254.
[02:29:34.683 --> 02:29:35.023]  That's 1-800-875-4254.
[02:29:46.912 --> 02:29:48.613]  Are you tired of frequent urination?
[02:29:49.013 --> 02:29:51.255]  Do you drink a ton of water and still feel thirsty?
[02:29:51.575 --> 02:29:54.658]  The quantity of water you drink is not the key to hydration.
[02:29:54.818 --> 02:29:57.780]  The key to hydration is the correct clustering of water.
[02:29:57.940 --> 02:30:01.463]  When water has the ideal cluster, your cells will readily absorb it.
[02:30:01.843 --> 02:30:02.704]  We're good to go.
[02:30:26.997 --> 02:30:27.357]  I think so.
[02:30:59.485 --> 02:31:03.188]  You know, I'm springing this on Curt Nemo.
[02:31:29.102 --> 02:31:30.303]  Prolific internet writer.
[02:31:31.023 --> 02:31:34.164]  He also webmasters some big TV station, radio station websites.
[02:31:34.705 --> 02:31:38.286]  He built whatistheendgame.com, the endgame website.
[02:31:39.567 --> 02:31:40.788]  Gorgeous, excellent website.
[02:31:40.808 --> 02:31:42.248]  Go look at the great trailers up there.
[02:31:42.849 --> 02:31:45.630]  We're putting out the official trailer tomorrow.
[02:31:45.670 --> 02:31:48.952]  By official, the first trailer was just the intro of the film.
[02:31:51.153 --> 02:31:52.333]  With some text at the front.
[02:31:53.414 --> 02:31:58.156]  And then the others are just kind of like little sneak peeks, compilations of some clips from the film.
[02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:05.682]  The official Fancy trailer and it's got some stuff you haven't seen yet and the other three trailers that are out there.
[02:32:06.122 --> 02:32:10.404]  It's going to be up on PrisonPlanet.com and TruthNews.us tomorrow.
[02:32:14.452 --> 02:32:18.775]  And I'm asking you to help us get it out to everybody, because this is the message that needs to get out.
[02:32:19.315 --> 02:32:26.019]  We're going to go to Richard, David, Renee, Sean, Thomas, before we leave with Kurt here in the 25 or so minutes we've got left.
[02:32:26.399 --> 02:32:35.685]  But Kurt, I'm cold calling you on this, and I know you're not somebody to say something if you don't really think it, so I'm kind of on the edge of my seat.
[02:32:36.457 --> 02:32:39.758]  But I mailed you Endgame a few weeks ago to make the Endgame site.
[02:32:39.778 --> 02:32:43.220]  We already built most of it to get some stills off of and some things.
[02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:46.321]  And, of course, the one you got sent didn't have the official fancy menus.
[02:32:46.361 --> 02:32:47.602]  You got sent a raw DVD.
[02:32:49.242 --> 02:32:51.543]  And then I've been so busy, I've only talked to you a few times since then.
[02:32:52.644 --> 02:32:54.364]  What did you think of Endgame?
[02:32:55.385 --> 02:32:56.045]  It was great.
[02:32:56.085 --> 02:32:56.845]  It was fantastic.
[02:32:56.885 --> 02:32:58.646]  But I'll tell you what, Alex, I was scared.
[02:32:58.766 --> 02:32:59.426]  It's scary.
[02:32:59.867 --> 02:33:05.889]  I learned a lot of stuff about eugenics and the New World Order and what they have in mind for us that I didn't know before.
[02:33:06.243 --> 02:33:12.708]  I had a general idea, but you guys laid it down pretty well, and I'll tell you, it's like a horror movie to a certain extent.
[02:33:13.349 --> 02:33:20.335]  Well, that's what I'd liken it to privately, but we almost had a catch line, but we thought it'd be cheesy, but it's true.
[02:33:20.375 --> 02:33:21.936]  It's like a horror movie, but it's real.
[02:33:22.677 --> 02:33:24.599]  All the more frightening, because they're saying it.
[02:33:24.939 --> 02:33:28.302]  By the way, I got into a debate with somebody who's involved with me.
[02:33:28.322 --> 02:33:29.903]  They're not in the office, they do work for us.
[02:33:29.923 --> 02:33:34.447]  He was a fan of Bertrand Russell, and he didn't believe some of the quotes.
[02:33:35.126 --> 02:33:36.027]  People think of Russell as
[02:34:01.109 --> 02:34:05.352]  You know, his role that he had in the 1960s in the peace movement and the anti-war movement.
[02:34:05.733 --> 02:34:09.776]  And they didn't look any farther than that and see that he was basically a eugenicist.
[02:34:10.997 --> 02:34:11.537]  Absolutely.
[02:34:11.577 --> 02:34:12.558]  Here, he just brought it into me.
[02:34:12.838 --> 02:34:14.640]  And then we actually purchased the book.
[02:34:16.061 --> 02:34:19.103]  Where's the comment here about the disgusting blacks?
[02:34:19.604 --> 02:34:20.404]  It's so many pages.
[02:34:21.725 --> 02:34:24.467]  The white population of the world will soon cease to increase.
[02:34:24.948 --> 02:34:26.969]  The Asiatic races will be
[02:34:28.488 --> 02:34:33.932]  Longer, and the Negroes still longer, before the birth rate falls sufficiently to make their numbers stable.
[02:34:34.232 --> 02:34:49.443]  Without help of war and pestilence, until that happens, the benefits aimed at socialism can only be partially realized, and the less prolific races will have to defend themselves by methods which are disgusting, even if they are necessary.
[02:34:50.083 --> 02:34:51.364]  Actually, he didn't show me the quote.
[02:34:51.384 --> 02:34:55.107]  There's a quote in here where he calls them disgusting blacks, and then we've got
[02:34:55.865 --> 02:34:57.667]  Queen Elizabeth II saying things.
[02:34:58.267 --> 02:35:05.354]  But my point here is that they're not playing games.
[02:35:05.394 --> 02:35:06.636]  They're doing this right now.
[02:35:06.896 --> 02:35:11.380]  And they're not just, even if you're a white racist out there and only care about whites, they're doing it to whites too.
[02:35:11.420 --> 02:35:12.281]  These people are nuts!
[02:35:13.022 --> 02:35:16.485]  Yeah, well, they're... What's the word I'm looking for?
[02:35:17.884 --> 02:35:18.964]  They hate humanity, you know?
[02:35:19.024 --> 02:35:22.465]  I mean, it's not racism per se.
[02:35:22.906 --> 02:35:23.746]  It's all of us.
[02:35:24.106 --> 02:35:27.487]  You know, look at the Georgia Guidestones, which you pointed out in the film.
[02:35:27.527 --> 02:35:31.408]  They say right there they're going to have a world population of 500 million.
[02:35:31.428 --> 02:35:34.889]  Well, that's bizarre, you know?
[02:35:35.309 --> 02:35:38.010]  So in essence, what they're talking about is eliminating most of us.
[02:35:38.150 --> 02:35:41.191]  And unfortunately, most people don't realize this, you know?
[02:35:43.055 --> 02:35:43.775]  Well, you're right.
[02:35:43.815 --> 02:35:52.381]  You know, I thought about putting... The in-game was so important a few months ago as I was nearing completion, I almost put it out for free, but then I'd be bankrupt.
[02:35:53.221 --> 02:35:54.682]  People said, well, why isn't it out now?
[02:35:54.742 --> 02:35:55.483]  We'll have a distributor.
[02:35:55.503 --> 02:36:02.467]  I have to wait until it goes in the stores in November for people to start pre-ordering on Friday, and we'll ship it out November 1st, and it'll be on the web on October 21st.
[02:36:03.450 --> 02:36:08.272]  Twenty-six, but I mean, look, people, it's up to you to get this film out when it comes out.
[02:36:08.292 --> 02:36:14.415]  But I've spent 14 months making this and now months building websites and paying to have it mastered and do all this.
[02:36:15.015 --> 02:36:21.898]  And I don't want to sit here and whine, but I need support to continue and expand and do the fighting we're doing here.
[02:36:21.938 --> 02:36:25.040]  I mean, this is this is an absolute total war.
[02:36:25.900 --> 02:36:34.049]  And if you aren't counted, and if you don't take action, I mean, frankly, I think Endgame should be the biggest, not just Patriot film ever, but biggest underground film ever.
[02:36:34.810 --> 02:36:40.055]  It is too long for the general attention span, two hours, twenty minutes, but watch it in two parts.
[02:36:40.235 --> 02:36:44.660]  All I'm saying is, this is the film, folks, that we need to go completely ape with.
[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:46.042]  Well, you know, Alex, I'm a pro.
[02:36:47.703 --> 02:37:04.968]  Pretty politically astute person and I'll admit to you that I didn't know two-thirds of the stuff in this movie I mean I knew about Sanger and I knew about the eugenics and but man you let it out and like I say it's scary It's like a horror film when you realize when you take a look at what these people have in mind for us
[02:37:05.976 --> 02:37:15.424]  Well, I mean, we find out, and it's admitted, that our government paid China IMF oil bank loans to do the one-child policy, and they started it as basically a carbon tax.
[02:37:15.464 --> 02:37:23.891]  They set a tax for the environment in 71, then by 80 it became the law, and to know they're doing the exact same thing here in Steps now?
[02:37:24.351 --> 02:37:28.454]  I mean, they're not playing games, and I keep saying that, but they're not playing games!
[02:37:30.216 --> 02:37:30.396]  Yeah.
[02:37:33.277 --> 02:37:37.840]  Actually, all of us are up against quite a task here.
[02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:43.765]  I mean, you take a look at most of the American public, or a large percentage of them, they still think that abortion is a personal right.
[02:37:44.045 --> 02:37:50.269]  They don't realize that Sanger and Planned Parenthood and the whole nine yards was part of the eugenicist project.
[02:37:50.349 --> 02:37:55.373]  And that's why the film is important, because people need to realize these things.
[02:37:55.393 --> 02:37:56.734]  They need to look on the other side.
[02:37:57.835 --> 02:38:00.497]  I sat down and watched it with my wife, and she had her mouth open.
[02:38:00.517 --> 02:38:02.098]  She didn't understand a lot of the stuff.
[02:38:02.598 --> 02:38:03.339]  Well, I want to be clear.
[02:38:03.359 --> 02:38:04.740]  I thought I knew a lot about eugenics.
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:07.963]  I don't think I know everything, but I learned just how ignorant I was.
[02:38:08.003 --> 02:38:08.463]  I mean, Kurt, we
[02:38:26.135 --> 02:38:26.736]  Well, they're misanthropes.
[02:38:26.756 --> 02:38:27.196]  They hate humanity.
[02:38:27.276 --> 02:38:28.317]  Except for their own, you know,
[02:38:49.353 --> 02:38:51.915]  They're on elite numbers.
[02:38:52.215 --> 02:38:55.837]  Otherwise, they hate all of us, regardless of skin color, or sex, or gender, or whatever.
[02:38:56.117 --> 02:39:03.701]  Isn't that the ultimate selfishness, where you're so selfish and greedy that you want to take other people's lives?
[02:39:04.782 --> 02:39:12.306]  Well, I mean, take a look at Prince Philip, what he said about wanting to come back as a germ, or a virus, and taking out two-thirds of humanity.
[02:39:12.626 --> 02:39:14.587]  Right there, that should be indicative of their mindset.
[02:39:16.374 --> 02:39:25.081]  And I'll tell you, I knew that before I saw Endgame, and that's it right there.
[02:39:25.381 --> 02:39:28.064]  That's the attitude that they have.
[02:39:28.524 --> 02:39:30.546]  And by the way, we saw all these quotes on the web.
[02:39:30.586 --> 02:39:32.767]  We bought, I don't know, 30, 40 books.
[02:39:32.927 --> 02:39:34.148]  There's boxes of them in here.
[02:39:34.168 --> 02:39:37.091]  I was digging around and one of your states has about 20 books in it.
[02:39:37.691 --> 02:39:39.633]  We actually bought If I Was an Animal.
[02:39:41.004 --> 02:39:41.324]  I think so.
[02:39:57.398 --> 02:39:58.018]  You did a good job.
[02:39:58.038 --> 02:40:00.359]  There's not too much voiceover and the graphics are fantastic.
[02:40:27.256 --> 02:40:29.219]  Um, it didn't seem like a two and a half hour film to me.
[02:40:29.459 --> 02:40:34.827]  Well, I just hope police out there listening and others in the system realize you're in the sites too, brother.
[02:40:35.488 --> 02:40:40.195]  I mean, you may think you're part of the system, but I got news and you may think you're defending the system and that it's for the good.
[02:40:40.576 --> 02:40:42.098]  Believe me, you don't know.
[02:40:43.087 --> 02:40:48.852]  I mean, I talk about this for the whole first hour, but you've read the John Yoo memos and the Alberto Gonzales memos.
[02:40:49.352 --> 02:40:58.380]  What is, Kurt Nemo, from your point of view, what is in the mindset of somebody who writes official memos for the military saying you can torture children sexually with pliers?
[02:40:58.860 --> 02:41:02.901]  No, quite frankly, they're psychopaths and sociopaths.
[02:41:03.042 --> 02:41:03.822]  That's what they are.
[02:41:03.922 --> 02:41:05.963]  And for them, you know, it's like the Nazis.
[02:41:05.983 --> 02:41:12.865]  They would do whatever they figured they, you know, and justifies the means, they would do whatever they figured they had to to accomplish their agenda.
[02:41:12.905 --> 02:41:14.225]  And that's precisely what they're doing.
[02:41:14.266 --> 02:41:16.366]  And those are the scariest people on the planet.
[02:41:18.767 --> 02:41:21.908]  And they also just enjoy stealing and robbing and having power.
[02:41:21.988 --> 02:41:22.849]  It's the enjoyment.
[02:41:23.809 --> 02:41:23.989]  Yeah.
[02:41:24.668 --> 02:41:30.352]  But I agree, they're definitely a mix of psychopaths, sociopaths, and then others in the system who go along because they're scared.
[02:41:32.613 --> 02:41:34.975]  And I think they're the lowest form of humanity out there.
[02:41:35.275 --> 02:41:36.756]  Richard in Texas, thanks for holding.
[02:41:36.796 --> 02:41:38.317]  You're on the air with Kurt Nemo.
[02:41:40.218 --> 02:41:40.999]  How's it going, Kurt?
[02:41:41.679 --> 02:41:42.420]  Good!
[02:41:42.900 --> 02:41:44.181]  Yes, Kurt, how's it going?
[02:41:44.761 --> 02:41:45.442]  Good, go ahead.
[02:41:45.462 --> 02:41:51.506]  I just want to thank you guys for all the work you guys do, and I want to thank God for giving us a chance to fly another day.
[02:41:52.139 --> 02:41:54.440]  Fight against the New World Order and fight Satan's forces.
[02:41:56.282 --> 02:42:17.594]  Hey Alex, a big piece of the pie that the Truth Movement seems to be missing out on, I'm not cutting on your analyzation skills or anything, but I've been doing some research on the Roman Empire, and shortly before the fall of Rome, Emperor Justinian in 533, made the Bishop of Rome
[02:42:19.736 --> 02:42:22.878]  The leader of all the churches, east and west of the Roman Empire?
[02:42:23.178 --> 02:42:30.202]  Yeah, number one, Rome fell officially for the final time in 410, and was really never an empire after that.
[02:42:30.442 --> 02:42:33.644]  They tried to reorganize it, but it never really became what it had been.
[02:42:33.864 --> 02:42:38.347]  The official, I mean, what most historians agree, is 410 when Alaric sacked Rome.
[02:42:39.507 --> 02:42:43.930]  But you have the emperors continuing up until like the mid-600s or so, right?
[02:42:44.835 --> 02:42:48.138]  Well, those were, yeah, the Holy Roman Emperors, yeah.
[02:42:48.558 --> 02:42:49.158]  Right, right.
[02:42:49.539 --> 02:42:59.947]  Well, and then, so, Justinian giving the Bishop of Rome this power made the Bishop, or the Pope, a King, or the Pontifex Maximus?
[02:43:00.507 --> 02:43:03.049]  Well, exactly, but it even went back before that.
[02:43:03.109 --> 02:43:05.611]  It went back to Constantine making himself the head of the Church.
[02:43:06.315 --> 02:43:07.036]  Right, right.
[02:43:07.496 --> 02:43:08.017]  Yeah, right.
[02:43:08.777 --> 02:43:09.918]  So, yeah, sure.
[02:43:09.938 --> 02:43:18.065]  So then you have... And the Roman Empire ran all of Europe until the Reformation.
[02:43:18.746 --> 02:43:20.367]  Right, right.
[02:43:20.627 --> 02:43:31.917]  So from 533 up until 1798 when Rome was taken over by Napoleon's forces, General Louis Verfeer, when he took over Rome,
[02:43:33.932 --> 02:43:46.183]  And then in the 1880s a deal was made to let Rome be autonomous as a city within a city again, yes, and they just absolutely huge banking and real estate holdings and all involved in the New World Order, absolutely.
[02:43:46.563 --> 02:43:54.650]  Yeah, the total combination of church and state being the Vatican.
[02:43:54.690 --> 02:43:59.174]  So until 1798 you have the succession of the Caesars and then
[02:44:01.365 --> 02:44:03.507]  Well, not exactly.
[02:44:04.908 --> 02:44:09.971]  I'm saying Rome was a shadow of itself after it fell.
[02:44:09.991 --> 02:44:10.952]  But go ahead and cut to the chase.
[02:44:10.972 --> 02:44:11.952]  I've got like five more calls.
[02:44:12.453 --> 02:44:26.922]  I guess the point I'm trying to get to is that the Catholic Church, or the Roman Catholic Church, they're the true funders of the Zionist movement, and the Nazis, and even the... Well, you could say that... Sure, sure.
[02:44:27.002 --> 02:44:28.443]  And listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:44:29.702 --> 02:44:34.545]  I've got to let you go or I won't have time to let Kirk comment or take calls, but here's my issue with that.
[02:44:36.226 --> 02:44:45.092]  I have had probably a hundred websites say I'm evil and I'm bad because I won't say Jews and only Jews are the founts of evil, when that's not true.
[02:44:45.152 --> 02:44:52.257]  You have evil elites throughout history, and there certainly are very corrupt Zionist forces out there doing really bad things.
[02:44:52.557 --> 02:44:53.718]  The British did bad things.
[02:44:53.778 --> 02:44:56.080]  I mean, that's my point, is it isn't going to help us
[02:44:57.350 --> 02:45:04.374]  To sit there and say that the New World Order is a Jewish conspiracy, even though there are a lot of, you know, Zionists involved in it, because it's bigger than that.
[02:45:04.414 --> 02:45:05.095]  It's evil people.
[02:45:05.195 --> 02:45:14.560]  And certainly, Roman power, Roman money, you know, all of that, the Catholic Church, it's like a deck of cards altogether.
[02:45:14.940 --> 02:45:17.462]  See, I mean, it's like saying ten guys robbed a bank.
[02:45:18.226 --> 02:45:20.749]  Okay, and I'm saying the Roman Catholic Church was robbing the bank.
[02:45:20.789 --> 02:45:21.870]  The Zionists were robbing the bank.
[02:45:22.210 --> 02:45:23.531]  The British were robbing the bank.
[02:45:24.312 --> 02:45:25.813]  You know, headed up by Protestants.
[02:45:25.833 --> 02:45:26.754]  And they'll say, no.
[02:45:27.195 --> 02:45:29.737]  One group will say, Jews are perfect and can do no wrong.
[02:45:29.757 --> 02:45:30.518]  The other group says, no.
[02:45:30.858 --> 02:45:31.919]  Catholics can do no wrong.
[02:45:31.979 --> 02:45:34.221]  Other groups, oh no, Protestants are all perfect.
[02:45:34.902 --> 02:45:35.142]  And so...
[02:45:36.663 --> 02:45:42.647]  I don't go out for the Jew bashing or the Catholic bashing or any of that because, number one, it's destructive.
[02:45:42.947 --> 02:45:45.348]  They try to balkanize us and get us into little groups.
[02:45:45.769 --> 02:45:47.109]  I'm against the North American Union.
[02:45:47.149 --> 02:45:47.690]  I'm going to fight it.
[02:45:48.230 --> 02:45:49.051]  I'm against this war.
[02:45:49.071 --> 02:45:49.631]  I'm going to fight it.
[02:45:50.151 --> 02:45:52.032]  And then these other groups, they never fight that.
[02:45:52.092 --> 02:45:53.413]  They just say, we're the group.
[02:45:53.493 --> 02:45:54.354]  We're the right group.
[02:45:54.394 --> 02:45:55.214]  We're the best group.
[02:45:55.534 --> 02:45:56.695]  That guy is evil.
[02:45:57.095 --> 02:45:58.776]  You won't be a Mormon, so you're evil.
[02:45:58.816 --> 02:46:00.697]  You won't be a Seventh-day Adventist, so you're evil.
[02:46:00.757 --> 02:46:02.899]  You won't be a... You're really a Scientologist.
[02:46:02.959 --> 02:46:03.639]  No, I'm not.
[02:46:03.659 --> 02:46:04.900]  I don't know any Scientologists.
[02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:16.007]  Shut up, you are one, and I found the folks that want to make everybody say that it's a Jewish conspiracy, and even if you talk about Zionists all day long, I mean, Kurt writes about it all the time, that's not good enough.
[02:46:16.807 --> 02:46:24.412]  It's really a way to bludgeon and bully people, and I found no one as bad as the mental case Catholics run it all crew.
[02:46:25.192 --> 02:46:32.477]  Like you just called in, you were reasonable, you brought things up, and you had the floor and you talked about it, and I agree with much of what you said.
[02:46:33.450 --> 02:46:38.276]  Uh, but then I'm not going to sit there and interview people and have people on who are liars!
[02:46:38.796 --> 02:46:42.141]  I mean, I mean, I could sue them into oblivion, but I don't have the time!
[02:46:42.161 --> 02:46:44.544]  You know, it's completely nuts!
[02:46:44.644 --> 02:46:47.688]  My family's famous Protestants on both sides!
[02:46:47.728 --> 02:46:49.249]  I mean, founding Texas!
[02:46:49.890 --> 02:46:56.031]  You know, bringing Bibles in, in Galveston, with Catholic priests running around trying to kill them.
[02:46:56.471 --> 02:47:02.373]  And they're all former Catholics, who I guess stuff was done to them when they were kids.
[02:47:02.693 --> 02:47:03.613]  They're all freaked out.
[02:47:03.653 --> 02:47:05.233]  They're seeing it as their view.
[02:47:05.893 --> 02:47:10.554]  And for me, it just makes me mad, because I'm tired of people saying stuff about me that isn't true!
[02:47:10.955 --> 02:47:12.595]  And then I hear them do their history lessons,
[02:47:14.051 --> 02:47:20.254]  And it's all made up, or it's twisted, or it's a guy in a hotel told me once, and that's their proof.
[02:47:22.916 --> 02:47:27.858]  And I will not be bullied into obsessing on Catholics or obsessing on Jews.
[02:47:28.278 --> 02:47:30.899]  I'm going to cover the news and information I believe is the truth.
[02:47:31.860 --> 02:47:33.641]  And again, a lot of this is COINTELPRO.
[02:47:34.101 --> 02:47:34.501]  Kurt Nimmo?
[02:47:37.157 --> 02:47:50.003]  Seeing the forest for the trees, you know, as opposed to Zionism or Catholicism or even monarchies, this all at its root stems back to power and, you know, and business.
[02:47:50.203 --> 02:47:57.906]  You could ban, exactly, exactly, you could ban Catholicism tomorrow and then the people running it would just jump into some new group.
[02:47:58.553 --> 02:48:05.259]  Right, and the people who rise to the top of the cesspool are the sociopathic personalities who gravitate towards power.
[02:48:05.299 --> 02:48:10.583]  So, it doesn't matter if they're Jews or Catholics or Irish or they're from planet Deptoon, you know.
[02:48:10.984 --> 02:48:18.770]  What matters is that this is a personality type that gravitates to these power centers, and that's precisely what's happening.
[02:48:18.851 --> 02:48:23.635]  And people are wasting our time by pointing fingers at Zionists or anybody else.
[02:48:23.655 --> 02:48:24.415]  I do talk about Israel.
[02:48:25.436 --> 02:48:32.485]  But that's because Israel is so egregious in its foreign policy and what it does to the Palestinians and how our foreign policy has been co-opted by them.
[02:48:32.765 --> 02:48:33.326]  Absolutely.
[02:48:33.386 --> 02:48:36.510]  I'm going to try to talk to David and Renee and a few others.
[02:48:36.871 --> 02:48:38.112]  Other side curtain demo, stay with us.
[02:48:48.590 --> 02:48:51.773]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.113 --> 02:48:54.035]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.415 --> 02:49:02.022]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.734 --> 02:49:09.796]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.196 --> 02:49:21.600]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:25.481]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.861 --> 02:49:27.802]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.162 --> 02:49:32.003]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:58.439 --> 02:50:04.906]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[02:50:05.146 --> 02:50:05.746]  We're good to go!
[02:50:27.691 --> 02:50:28.252]  I think so.
[02:50:45.420 --> 02:50:47.241]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:50:47.401 --> 02:50:52.563]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:50:52.743 --> 02:50:54.083]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:50:54.364 --> 02:51:02.527]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:51:02.747 --> 02:51:08.469]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:51:08.649 --> 02:51:10.431]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:51:10.491 --> 02:51:12.653]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:51:12.673 --> 02:51:17.058]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:51:17.218 --> 02:51:19.341]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:51:19.441 --> 02:51:26.789]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:51:28.100 --> 02:51:29.061]  Come, you masters of war!
[02:51:51.155 --> 02:51:54.338]  Yeah, build the big guns!
[02:51:54.658 --> 02:51:57.940]  I gotta cut Bob Dylan off so we can take your calls quickly.
[02:51:58.001 --> 02:52:00.222]  David in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:52:00.242 --> 02:52:01.683]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[02:52:01.984 --> 02:52:02.364]  Good, sir.
[02:52:03.245 --> 02:52:09.189]  Well, I just wanted to talk to you about corporate globalization and maybe some things that we could help stop this.
[02:52:09.209 --> 02:52:12.572]  No, we can't talk about corporate globalization and the power structure of that.
[02:52:12.932 --> 02:52:14.694]  We've got to say it's all Jews!
[02:52:15.530 --> 02:52:17.091]  No, that's not the answer!
[02:52:17.371 --> 02:52:20.234]  The answer belongs in the... We've got to say it's all Scientologists!
[02:52:20.734 --> 02:52:21.495]  Not at all!
[02:52:21.655 --> 02:52:22.335]  Not at all!
[02:52:23.156 --> 02:52:30.001]  No, we must... If you would pass this along to Ron Paul for me, please, that would be... By the way, he was supposed to be on today, but they messed up his schedule.
[02:52:30.321 --> 02:52:31.162]  He's going to be on Friday.
[02:52:31.202 --> 02:52:31.542]  Go ahead.
[02:52:32.122 --> 02:52:32.683]  Well, okay.
[02:52:33.043 --> 02:52:42.870]  So, the problem with corporate globalization, the only reason it's been allowed to take place is the fact that we've given corporations, um, amendment rights.
[02:52:42.890 --> 02:52:43.791]  They were not afforded
[02:52:45.019 --> 02:52:46.942]  Yeah, corporations are people.
[02:52:47.022 --> 02:52:54.775]  They're not living, but they have the rights of people, and it gives them that liability protection and engage in a lot of corruption, and they operate as crime syndicates.
[02:52:54.796 --> 02:52:56.458]  I don't mean your corporation, folks.
[02:52:56.659 --> 02:52:57.781]  You got a bakery.
[02:52:58.354 --> 02:53:04.860]  Well, I mean, how many people live to be 300, 200 years old?
[02:53:04.940 --> 02:53:20.855]  I mean, in the 1890s, I think it was the Supreme Court decided that corporations had the legal status of people, of an individual, and that's just absurd on its face because they could perpetuate over decades and decades.
[02:53:21.440 --> 02:53:23.022]  You know, the same thing.
[02:53:23.062 --> 02:53:24.443]  And you're right, it's a crime syndicate.
[02:53:24.483 --> 02:53:27.827]  Basically these large multinational corporations are crime syndicates.
[02:53:27.927 --> 02:53:30.109]  And they want to dissolve the United States.
[02:53:30.690 --> 02:53:33.232]  David, I've got to cut you short because I gave Richard so long.
[02:53:33.272 --> 02:53:33.753]  Anything else?
[02:53:35.915 --> 02:53:37.777]  Call me back tomorrow, David, and I'll get you on.
[02:53:37.797 --> 02:53:40.079]  Rene and North Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:53:40.119 --> 02:53:40.440]  Go ahead.
[02:53:41.380 --> 02:53:57.067]  Well, um, I disagree with you a little bit, but I want you to know this isn't to nitpick you, this is because I really want you to be really accurate, because when you get something wrong, I don't want somebody to use that to discredit you.
[02:53:57.167 --> 02:53:58.067]  No, I understand.
[02:53:58.087 --> 02:53:58.887]  Well, thank you.
[02:53:58.907 --> 02:53:59.348]  You're on air.
[02:53:59.388 --> 02:53:59.968]  Tell me I'm wrong.
[02:54:00.368 --> 02:54:04.950]  Okay, um, the thing is, I think you've just seen snippets of 24.
[02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:08.931]  I just finished watching the entire five seasons on DVD.
[02:54:09.311 --> 02:54:24.556]  In fact, you would really love season five because it shows how the President of the United States was actually responsible for the germ warfare weapons getting in their hands and Jack Power kidnapped the President of the United States
[02:54:25.956 --> 02:54:29.998]  And the first lady participated in getting, trapping him into a confession.
[02:54:30.018 --> 02:54:33.499]  Okay, well I'll tell you something nobody knows, and I'm not going to back it up because I'm not allowed to give the source.
[02:54:34.660 --> 02:54:37.221]  Keither Sutherland knows all about 9-11 being an inside job.
[02:54:37.601 --> 02:54:41.903]  The first and second season, I know were bad, I read the synopses, I know it's quote, better now.
[02:54:42.443 --> 02:54:46.845]  But it still conditions you for secret police and secret arrest and legitimizes all that.
[02:54:46.865 --> 02:54:49.586]  So when you study psychology, you then know it's bad.
[02:54:49.646 --> 02:54:49.846]  Kurt?
[02:54:50.848 --> 02:54:55.952]  Well, yeah, that's interesting that this current season has the President behind a germ warfare attack.
[02:54:56.272 --> 02:55:06.801]  In a way, that kind of legitimizes it, because people put such prestige and credibility... And then it may not be the President, it may be somebody else that does it.
[02:55:07.721 --> 02:55:08.302]  Yeah.
[02:55:08.522 --> 02:55:11.744]  I'll be honest with you, I've never watched the show, so I can't really comment on it.
[02:55:12.965 --> 02:55:17.929]  Yeah, the point is, ma'am, the Homeland Security says they're using it to condition the public.
[02:55:17.989 --> 02:55:19.911]  I mean, do you know that's going on?
[02:55:21.741 --> 02:55:22.161]  Well, no.
[02:55:22.241 --> 02:55:29.526]  The thing is, I know Sutherland, because it's in his Wikipedia biography, was horrified when he found out that the series had influenced U.S.
[02:55:29.686 --> 02:55:32.188]  Army personnel to think Parcher's acceptable.
[02:55:32.808 --> 02:55:35.750]  What I find interesting is that only
[02:55:37.211 --> 02:55:48.135]  Clinton has only started to criticize this when Keeper Sutherland must keep his mouth shut now because he is on the hook for that DUI where he could get sent to prison for a year.
[02:55:48.595 --> 02:55:59.380]  So, if you look at Keeper Sutherland's political party affiliation in Canada, you would know that he would object to something like this, but right now... Yeah, well, I know folks that know him.
[02:55:59.400 --> 02:56:00.200]  We'll just leave it there.
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:01.160]  Thank you.
[02:56:01.200 --> 02:56:01.761]  We're out of time.
[02:56:01.781 --> 02:56:02.641]  I'm sorry to Sean.
[02:56:03.991 --> 02:56:04.752]  Thomas and others.
[02:56:04.792 --> 02:56:06.152]  Call me back out of the line tomorrow.
[02:56:06.492 --> 02:56:08.954]  Kurt Nimmo, TruthNews.us.

[02:56:18.319 --> 02:56:18.979]  No problem, man.
[02:56:18.999 --> 02:56:19.840]  It's good to work with you.
[02:56:20.140 --> 02:56:21.461]  It's good to be working with you, my brother.
[02:56:21.481 --> 02:56:22.281]  All right.
