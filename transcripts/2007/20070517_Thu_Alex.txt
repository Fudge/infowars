[00:00:05.548 --> 00:00:06.188]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:07.910]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:09.752]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.392 --> 00:00:11.193]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.954 --> 00:00:12.935]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:17.158]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:21.783]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:39.573]  Well, Michelle Malkin wrote a book titled, The Case for Internment.
[00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:45.238]  And she does believe that all Arabs in this country should be put in concentration camps.
[00:00:46.318 --> 00:00:47.399]  All Muslims, that is.
[00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.942]  And she also believes that, uh, she's made lots of statements about glass parking lots.
[00:00:55.465 --> 00:01:01.990]  It's, uh, really scary to see somebody like her up there saying, Ron Paul should not be allowed to have free speech.
[00:01:02.904 --> 00:01:18.316]  That's a big theme with the Pentagon-run Fox News, is to ban free speech in the United States, and you hear their supporters, like Troy in West Virginia, calling and saying, yeah, we should be banned, we should not have free speech, I should be kicked out of the country.
[00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:28.204]  Now, in Ron Paul's congressional campaign, which he won by his highest margin ever last time, this year,
[00:01:31.852 --> 00:01:40.917]  They used an interview he did on this show, actual audio of it, in television ads in Texas against him.
[00:01:42.258 --> 00:01:43.918]  Didn't have permission, they still did it.
[00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:48.661]  And they put it in print ads, you name it, saying that Bush should be impeached.
[00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:54.884]  He said anyone who voted for the unconstitutional war should be impeached, including the Democratic and Republican leadership.
[00:01:56.145 --> 00:01:57.966]  And of course they should be, they're a pack of crooks.
[00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:00.087]  And they used that against him.
[00:02:01.318 --> 00:02:10.741]  Now, Fox News and that albino vampire... I'm not insulting albinos, that's just what he looks like, an albino vampire.
[00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:13.262]  I am insulting vampires, though.
[00:02:13.822 --> 00:02:15.043]  John Gibson.
[00:02:16.163 --> 00:02:19.705]  Malkin Gibson attacked 9-11 conspiracy nut Alex Jones.
[00:02:20.385 --> 00:02:26.247]  Cheyron Paul should be kicked out of debates for appearing on this show.
[00:02:27.097 --> 00:02:56.384]  suggest Middle Easter's enjoy being bombed and to claim otherwise is a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory and she actually said that now this is getting serious I have the photos and I have the news article in Boston where someone in Abu Ghraib protest in the classic Abu Ghraib photo the guy up on the on the milk case the plastic milk case standing there with his hands outstretched with the hood over his head
[00:02:57.023 --> 00:03:00.524]  And they came out of the recruiting station and punched him in the stomach and knocked him to the ground.
[00:03:01.024 --> 00:03:06.485]  Cops stood by and watched and they came and arrested him and charged him with felonies.
[00:03:10.646 --> 00:03:13.587]  And I did have coming on the show today, Josh Wolfe.
[00:03:14.387 --> 00:03:19.928]  I just told John to cancel him because my producer is out for part of the day today.
[00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:23.589]  But maybe I should just have Josh Wolfe on.
[00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:24.909]  Did you already call and cancel him?
[00:03:28.112 --> 00:03:29.333]  Let's just go ahead and have him on.
[00:03:29.353 --> 00:03:31.094]  Let's just have him on for 15 minutes or so.
[00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:34.296]  It's a big story, and we've known about it for months, obviously.
[00:03:34.316 --> 00:03:48.226]  It's been all over the news, and we've covered it here, but Josh Wolf, of course, just was videotaping some demonstrations, and they arrested him and kept him in jail for months and months, saying it was terrorism to videotape the police.
[00:03:50.087 --> 00:03:52.288]  Yeah, it's starting to happen, folks.
[00:03:52.368 --> 00:03:54.030]  It's really starting to happen, and
[00:03:56.027 --> 00:04:03.910]  We've got more people in prison than any other country in the world, and they're not stopping their construction of all these camps and facilities, they're accelerating them.
[00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.492]  So we'll just have Josh Wolff on, coming up for a little while in the next hour.
[00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:17.615]  And Greg Pallast has been chomping at the bit to come on, so he's coming on in the third hour today for about 30 minutes.
[00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:21.937]  We are going to take phones in this hour, in the second hour and the third hour.
[00:04:23.248 --> 00:04:24.149]  Try to take a lot of them.
[00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:25.230]  The toll-free number.
[00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.711]  Talk about any subject you'd like.
[00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:28.813]  First-time callers are encouraged.
[00:04:28.913 --> 00:04:30.094]  We'll go to the head of the line.
[00:04:30.114 --> 00:04:32.717]  If you tell us you're a first-time caller, but I'll take everybody's call.
[00:04:33.237 --> 00:04:35.719]  Everybody's call is welcomed.
[00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:36.380]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:38.742 --> 00:04:40.724]  We have the Fox News audio.
[00:04:41.284 --> 00:04:46.049]  Whoever uploaded it to YouTube, let's just say, didn't do the best job of it.
[00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:47.650]  It's a little distorted and overdriven.
[00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.712]  We're trying to find a better copy of it.
[00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:53.038]  But we will be airing it come hell or high water.
[00:04:53.798 --> 00:04:55.720]  If the hair lifts the admiral, as they say.
[00:04:56.881 --> 00:04:59.242]  If the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek.
[00:05:00.363 --> 00:05:07.648]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.988 --> 00:05:09.929]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:17.955]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.624 --> 00:05:25.687]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.087 --> 00:05:37.492]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.812 --> 00:05:41.734]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.695]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:47.897]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:58.124 --> 00:06:59.986]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:03.091 --> 00:07:05.054]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[00:07:05.535 --> 00:07:08.098]  But every time I get a pedicure my feet look great.
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.081]  For a while, anyway.
[00:07:10.601 --> 00:07:13.764]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[00:07:14.364 --> 00:07:16.706]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[00:07:17.006 --> 00:07:20.509]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.111]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[00:07:23.692 --> 00:07:24.392]  What's the name again?
[00:07:24.412 --> 00:07:25.773]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[00:07:26.174 --> 00:07:26.994]  It's CalX.
[00:07:27.315 --> 00:07:27.775]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:31.502]  What makes Cal-X ointment so different?
[00:07:31.722 --> 00:07:40.065]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:45.646]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[00:07:45.847 --> 00:07:54.970]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.770]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.491]  I'll be right back.
[00:07:57.751 --> 00:07:58.691]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:06.091]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:08.774]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:28.571]  We did find a better audio clip of the video we currently have posted of an incredible smear job that was engaged in against Congressman Ron Paul, myself,
[00:08:29.335 --> 00:08:32.736]  Charlie Sheen and many others yesterday.
[00:08:33.756 --> 00:08:35.657]  We're going to be uploading that.
[00:08:35.837 --> 00:08:36.837]  It's on the Fox News site.
[00:08:36.857 --> 00:08:42.079]  We're going to upload it and get it up to Prison Planet in the next 30 minutes or so so you can go find it easily.
[00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:51.701]  It was hard to find and replace the bad YouTube link that we have where it sounds like hammered... Well, you know what they call it.
[00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:53.122]  Hammered turkey wings.
[00:08:54.282 --> 00:08:54.962]  But that is coming up.
[00:09:00.859 --> 00:09:27.575]  Michelle Malkin makes me sick with her fake indignation and you know sitting there and pursing her lips and her eyes all looking crazed and violent but really she's just crazed for book sales with titles like the case for internment camps and she really is a completely un-American piece of filth and hey here's the good news which
[00:09:28.783 --> 00:09:32.724]  In the last year, your website has gone from something to almost nothing.
[00:09:33.204 --> 00:09:39.446]  I mean, O'Reilly on all the major web ranking systems is at like 60-something thousand.
[00:09:39.926 --> 00:09:42.047]  Limbaugh's now at 30-something thousand.
[00:09:42.767 --> 00:09:44.828]  Limbaugh used to be like number 500, folks.
[00:09:45.788 --> 00:09:46.728]  Like the Drudge Report.
[00:09:47.449 --> 00:09:48.969]  The Drudge Report is plunging.
[00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:51.850]  Michelle Malkin is some number in the stratosphere.
[00:09:53.419 --> 00:10:08.983]  All of their numbers are plunging, from Fox News to Michelle Malkin to all the dirtbag, fake left, liberal gatekeepers who were there to control the legitimate left, if you could call it that in this country.
[00:10:10.464 --> 00:10:11.624]  It's just over for you.
[00:10:11.684 --> 00:10:12.704]  Do you understand that?
[00:10:13.845 --> 00:10:18.006]  And so when you get up there, you un-American piece of filth,
[00:10:19.571 --> 00:10:20.292]  Make me sick.
[00:10:20.932 --> 00:10:23.234]  Make me so sick I can hardly even form ideas.
[00:10:23.254 --> 00:10:28.738]  I'm just looking at her because yes I've done what I wouldn't allow myself in years past to do because it always becomes a distraction.
[00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:31.681]  I have a laptop and a computer in the studio.
[00:10:33.122 --> 00:10:37.566]  Been here for about a month and you'll notice you hear pauses on the show now where I'm scrolling around.
[00:10:37.586 --> 00:10:39.707]  It is a distraction.
[00:10:39.727 --> 00:10:40.608]  I gotta get it out of here.
[00:10:41.589 --> 00:10:46.453]  But I mean just looking at her is I mean I see an enemy and I know an enemy when I see one.
[00:10:47.594 --> 00:10:49.035]  And there on the screen
[00:10:50.336 --> 00:11:01.403]  Mr. Gibson and Miss Malkin are definitely enemies of this country, and definitely enemies of your family, and definitely enemies of everything good and decent.
[00:11:02.284 --> 00:11:12.350]  They mean to build camps, which they have constructed, coast to coast, and they mean to have nationwide gun confiscation, and they mean to have their way with us.
[00:11:13.311 --> 00:11:19.555]  And Fox News is firmly behind Hillary Clinton, Roger Ailes of Fox News, and of course Limbaugh fame,
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.521]  Is advising her campaign, that's come out?
[00:11:23.221 --> 00:11:26.181]  We told you that four years ago, it's now been in the news the last two.
[00:11:26.802 --> 00:11:28.642]  You couldn't believe us when we'd say it, you'd laugh.
[00:11:29.322 --> 00:11:38.144]  And I just want all the Fox News viewers to know that we're talking about trillions of dollars a week in control and profits and money and power.
[00:11:39.005 --> 00:11:44.126]  Now don't you think big powerful interests are going to go pose as conservatives and try to scam you?
[00:11:47.794 --> 00:11:53.637]  I mean, look at how they're promoting torture and open borders and restricting free speech.
[00:11:54.818 --> 00:11:57.799]  And frankly, Paul Watson has done a good job here.
[00:11:57.819 --> 00:12:10.926]  The guy just is writing like four articles a day, doing customer service for PrisonPlanet.tv, updating the website, doing ad banners, just, you know, I mean, he's dedicated.
[00:12:11.626 --> 00:12:13.227]  Steve Watson's working very hard as well.
[00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:19.317]  But frankly, his headline is a good story, and it does cover one facet of it, and it does give you the material.
[00:12:19.637 --> 00:12:20.578]  But it misses the boat.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.883]  And I'm not knocking Paul.
[00:12:23.903 --> 00:12:26.987]  A couple days ago, I sent him a story and said, I want something done on this.
[00:12:27.007 --> 00:12:28.949]  And he says, no, you're missing the boat.
[00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.334]  The story isn't that they fired that Silverstein security guard.
[00:12:33.027 --> 00:12:40.916]  With Luke Rodowski, the story is that Luke said he talked to a security guard, which Luke had told me weeks before, months before, I'd forgotten about.
[00:12:41.236 --> 00:12:47.222]  The big story is that the security guards had told him previously that Silverstein was told not to come into work that day.
[00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:49.585]  And I'm like, you're right, that is the story.
[00:12:50.606 --> 00:12:52.488]  That's the bigger part of the story.
[00:12:53.334 --> 00:13:01.240]  Well, I'm here to tell you, the story is not yet another Fox News smear job on Ron Paul, Alex Jones and 9-11 Truth.
[00:13:01.721 --> 00:13:04.943]  I really don't care if the Pentagon smears me.
[00:13:05.884 --> 00:13:10.788]  And again, the head of the Naval War College admits, the Pentagon works for private banks.
[00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:18.014]  And they have symposiums on C-SPAN and say, we work for Wall Street, we work for big banks, we work for the Fortune 500.
[00:13:18.854 --> 00:13:20.836]  Which, by the way, is offshore, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:21.661 --> 00:13:25.662]  What isn't offshore is getting offshore for the planned implosion of this country.
[00:13:26.002 --> 00:13:30.383]  You can see every major corporation evacuating this country now.
[00:13:31.483 --> 00:13:33.444]  The evacuation is almost complete.
[00:13:33.944 --> 00:13:38.665]  And when they have evacuated, folks, get ready because what I'm seeing doesn't look pretty.
[00:13:39.165 --> 00:13:42.666]  And let me tell you, she's going to be a god while they're hunting us down.
[00:13:43.026 --> 00:13:44.286]  And I want you to remember this later.
[00:13:44.747 --> 00:13:46.547]  Michelle Malkin is going to be a god.
[00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:48.360]  Well, they're hunting us down.
[00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:53.045]  She is going to be all over TV when they're first arresting all the brown people.
[00:13:53.085 --> 00:13:58.070]  That's why they like to use her as a poster child, a poster girl, because she's Asian.
[00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.872]  She's got, you know, she likes a suntan on top of it.
[00:14:01.213 --> 00:14:08.540]  She's got the dark hair, and she's a woman, and she's perfect to push torture and evil and mass bombing and everything else.
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.721]  But let me explain something.
[00:14:11.169 --> 00:14:15.791]  And I think it's wrong to do that to the Muslims and the Arabs and anybody of color.
[00:14:15.831 --> 00:14:20.053]  But the globalists are going to test everything out on them publicly, as they're doing now.
[00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:23.735]  But the real target is farmers and ranchers.
[00:14:24.235 --> 00:14:25.876]  And the real target is militias.
[00:14:26.296 --> 00:14:27.837]  And the real target is gun owners.
[00:14:28.217 --> 00:14:34.420]  And the real target is the American people and the middle class, which is predominantly white.
[00:14:35.401 --> 00:14:38.262]  And if you don't know, white America
[00:14:39.102 --> 00:14:44.583]  That you are the target of the New World Order, then you don't know anything.
[00:14:48.384 --> 00:14:52.265]  Now let's be clear, everyone is the target of the New World Order.
[00:14:53.485 --> 00:15:03.967]  And if the biggest section, we're talking 70%, of the middle class wasn't white but was black, you'd see them gearing up to attack the blacks.
[00:15:04.047 --> 00:15:04.587]  But it isn't.
[00:15:05.499 --> 00:15:10.443]  If 70% of the middle class was Hispanic, you'd see a gear up for an attack on Hispanics.
[00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:16.429]  You've seen all the FBI training manuals, the new ones.
[00:15:16.709 --> 00:15:20.112]  People always, when we post them, go, well, that was under Clinton.
[00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:29.280]  We go, nah-ah-ah, 2003, 2004, 2005, where it says gun owners, Christians, conservatives, land rights activists, anti-immigration activists.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.321]  You are listed as terrorist.
[00:15:32.502 --> 00:15:33.083]  Officially.
[00:15:33.661 --> 00:15:44.366]  When they have these drills at the school, from North Carolina, to Tennessee, to Texas, to Michigan, to Ohio, to New York, to California, they tell them, we're homeschoolers.
[00:15:44.907 --> 00:15:46.167]  We're here to kill you.
[00:15:47.068 --> 00:15:47.788]  Coast to coast.
[00:15:47.808 --> 00:15:48.768]  That's a federal grant.
[00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:50.389]  You're the target.
[00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:56.052]  The very racist, stupid, spoiled,
[00:15:56.844 --> 00:16:13.495]  White Americans, whose grandfathers and grandmothers and great-grandparents carved out this nation and built it for you, and you sit there, wrapped in the flag, watching Fox News while the whole country is imploded around us.
[00:16:14.575 --> 00:16:16.957]  And by the way, it isn't being imploded in slow motion.
[00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:21.740]  In the scale of time, a year, two years, five years, is like a millisecond.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.421]  Just the twinkling of an eye.
[00:16:25.049 --> 00:16:26.891]  Just that little gleam you see in the eye.
[00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:28.592]  That's how long it takes, okay?
[00:16:29.553 --> 00:16:36.418]  It is at rapid, hyper-warp, light speed to the thousandth power right now.
[00:16:36.718 --> 00:16:43.323]  The country, the borders, the dollar, the industry, it's all imploding right now.
[00:16:43.683 --> 00:16:44.144]  Literally.
[00:16:44.364 --> 00:16:44.804]  Mayday!
[00:16:45.044 --> 00:16:45.505]  Mayday!
[00:16:45.705 --> 00:16:46.045]  Mayday!
[00:16:46.065 --> 00:16:46.886]  You need to hear alarms.
[00:16:47.126 --> 00:16:48.767]  I mean, we're talking air raid sirens.
[00:16:48.787 --> 00:16:49.708]  You should hear them right now.
[00:16:49.748 --> 00:16:50.989]  We ought to get those queued up.
[00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:52.430]  We ought to get those in the queue and play them.
[00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:53.591]  I mean, you should be hearing...
[00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:57.294]  Alert!
[00:16:57.414 --> 00:16:57.774]  Alert!
[00:16:57.854 --> 00:16:58.094]  Alert!
[00:16:58.134 --> 00:16:59.035]  But you're not hearing that.
[00:16:59.295 --> 00:17:07.101]  Instead, it's all these trollops stumbling around on Fox News with albino vampires like Mr. Gibson.
[00:17:10.194 --> 00:17:14.419]  Up there saying Ron Paul should be banned from television.
[00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:17.382]  Ron Paul should be kicked out of the debates.
[00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:20.866]  Ron Paul should be kicked out of the Republican Party.
[00:17:21.287 --> 00:17:23.749]  No, you've got it backwards, Michelle Malkin.
[00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:26.272]  You should be kicked out of the Republican Party.
[00:17:26.773 --> 00:17:27.193]  You!
[00:17:27.574 --> 00:17:30.517]  But again, I agree with your right to be in it even though you aren't a conservative.
[00:17:30.897 --> 00:17:34.399]  The point is, by your yardstick, you should be out of there.
[00:17:34.799 --> 00:17:54.127]  And your open border promoting, federal government tripling in size, deficit doubling in size, complete bankruptcy of everything, wall-to-wall pork barrel, Bush signing back on to all the UN treaties, it should be people like you that are ostracized by conservatives.
[00:17:54.387 --> 00:17:58.949]  But the truth is, conservatives, a large portion of them, have been deceived
[00:18:00.015 --> 00:18:01.756]  And have been beguiled?
[00:18:02.296 --> 00:18:04.898]  And have been seduced?
[00:18:06.439 --> 00:18:11.962]  By trollops like you, painted lilies, and they have taken you in.
[00:18:13.502 --> 00:18:20.666]  They have taken you in, America, and they basically were able to get the throat slit of this country.
[00:18:20.726 --> 00:18:23.668]  Now we can just try to desperately salvage something.
[00:18:23.708 --> 00:18:29.171]  I mean, even though the thing's going down, we know the plane's crashing, we might as well brace for impact here.
[00:18:31.187 --> 00:18:32.748]  And just know, they have their way.
[00:18:33.069 --> 00:18:35.231]  And that doesn't mean they're going to win if they get violent.
[00:18:35.711 --> 00:18:36.832]  But it'll look like they're winning.
[00:18:37.392 --> 00:18:48.182]  As they hunt people like me down, as they trump stuff up on us, as they imprison us or kill us, as they run their purges that they call for every show on Fox almost every day.
[00:18:49.102 --> 00:18:55.870]  Just know as they hunt down Defenders of the Republic, just know as they hunt down the last vestiges, that they are the enemy!
[00:18:56.391 --> 00:18:59.415]  And when we take this country back, avenge us!
[00:19:00.096 --> 00:19:05.182]  When you take this country back, avenge us that we're on the front lines!
[00:19:05.422 --> 00:19:12.885]  And make sure that people like Michelle Malkin, traitors to America, are brought before grand juries and then juries.
[00:19:13.125 --> 00:19:19.328]  And you make sure they get the punishment that arch criminals and arch traitors against the Republic get.
[00:19:19.988 --> 00:19:24.910]  You just make sure that we're avenged and the Republic is avenged.
[00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:29.692]  You make sure that everyone remember who these Nazi pigs were.
[00:19:29.712 --> 00:19:34.814]  And you make sure they pay for what they've done to this country!
[00:19:36.184 --> 00:19:43.570]  There openly on television calling for us to be shut down and for us to be arrested and for us to be put in camps.
[00:19:44.591 --> 00:19:44.951]  No!
[00:19:45.612 --> 00:19:50.095]  It is you that through due process will be brought to heel.
[00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:55.019]  It is you, this menace, that will be defeated.
[00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:56.941]  And you know it.
[00:19:57.061 --> 00:19:58.362]  That's why you're scared.
[00:20:05.316 --> 00:20:14.248]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.689 --> 00:20:21.899]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.612 --> 00:20:28.094]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.595 --> 00:20:39.419]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:42.240]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:44.161]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:48.703 --> 00:20:51.205]  Or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:20:51.285 --> 00:20:51.766]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:21:01.613 --> 00:21:05.514]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:05.734 --> 00:21:18.017]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:18.437 --> 00:21:18.837]  The U.S.
[00:21:18.877 --> 00:21:24.479]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:24.859 --> 00:21:27.060]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.001]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:32.882]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:21:33.002 --> 00:21:39.025]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:21:39.446 --> 00:21:42.807]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:21:42.887 --> 00:21:49.231]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:21:49.771 --> 00:21:53.795]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:21:53.915 --> 00:21:54.176]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.196 --> 00:21:54.416]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.548 --> 00:22:04.711]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:22:04.751 --> 00:22:08.794]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:22:08.934 --> 00:22:11.496]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:22:11.556 --> 00:22:13.878]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:22:14.058 --> 00:22:22.505]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:22:22.585 --> 00:22:23.886]  The Brookie light is different.
[00:22:24.026 --> 00:22:28.029]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:22:28.049 --> 00:22:28.469]  I think so.
[00:22:48.746 --> 00:22:51.470]  The Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.
[00:22:51.491 --> 00:22:53.394]  888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:22:53.414 --> 00:22:54.095]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:02.875]  I'm Dr. Bill Diggle, M.D.
[00:23:02.975 --> 00:23:05.277]  on the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:08.379]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax NutraCyticals U.S.
[00:23:08.459 --> 00:23:09.139]  is a real thing.
[00:23:09.199 --> 00:23:16.063]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:23:16.204 --> 00:23:21.487]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:23:21.527 --> 00:23:22.388]  We're good to go!
[00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.934]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:23:51.994 --> 00:23:55.358]  That number again, 888-212-8871 for the most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:24:10.607 --> 00:24:12.468]  It is time.
[00:24:13.949 --> 00:24:17.051]  It is time.
[00:24:17.551 --> 00:24:20.012]  It is time.
[00:24:20.232 --> 00:24:23.434]  It is time.
[00:24:23.814 --> 00:24:25.716]  It is time.
[00:24:40.439 --> 00:24:41.920]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.201]  It certainly is stormy weather.
[00:24:44.462 --> 00:24:45.502]  This is the bottom line.
[00:24:46.003 --> 00:24:50.266]  Enemies of the Republic seized control of the Democratic Party a long time ago.
[00:24:50.306 --> 00:24:53.027]  They seized control of the Republican Party as well.
[00:24:53.588 --> 00:24:56.990]  We're talking about completely seized control 75-plus years ago.
[00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:58.871]  Kennedy was an anomaly.
[00:24:58.891 --> 00:24:59.972]  You saw what they did to him.
[00:25:00.632 --> 00:25:07.257]  And they're desperate right now that real conservatives, libertarians, and classical-type liberals
[00:25:08.641 --> 00:25:11.444]  Our seizing control of the Republican nomination.
[00:25:12.706 --> 00:25:15.710]  You see, the Democrats are very unpopular.
[00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.194]  They only have a 27% approval rating.
[00:25:19.234 --> 00:25:21.097]  That's both parties averaged together.
[00:25:22.512 --> 00:25:26.434]  The Republicans only have a 18% approval rating in Congress.
[00:25:26.955 --> 00:25:29.156]  Dick Cheney has a 12% approval rating.
[00:25:29.536 --> 00:25:32.578]  Hillary Clinton has less than a 30% approval rating in the Senate.
[00:25:33.058 --> 00:25:34.559]  Both parties are hated.
[00:25:34.999 --> 00:25:38.261]  Both parties are distrusted for the first time in modern history.
[00:25:38.281 --> 00:25:44.345]  They just had a Gallup poll last weekend showing this again, that Bush and Congress have the same approval rating.
[00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.591]  Normally they can fool us with a bait-and-switch, with the tag-team wrestling.
[00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:53.392]  They put one wrestler in, and when he gets tired, they pull him out and put another in.
[00:25:54.972 --> 00:25:57.573]  And now the jig's up, folks, and it's accelerating.
[00:25:57.653 --> 00:26:00.694]  More people that are still asleep are starting to wake up every day.
[00:26:00.994 --> 00:26:04.695]  They're hearing me go, hey, Fox News and Rupert Murdoch's behind Hillary.
[00:26:04.935 --> 00:26:07.115]  They actually are going and Googling it and finding it.
[00:26:07.135 --> 00:26:08.356]  And they're going, what?
[00:26:09.196 --> 00:26:10.096]  They're going, what?
[00:26:12.297 --> 00:26:14.077]  They're circling the wagons.
[00:26:15.141 --> 00:26:17.083]  Both parties together.
[00:26:18.084 --> 00:26:22.287]  Every Democratic candidate in there, folks, is bad news.
[00:26:22.827 --> 00:26:25.409]  Kucinich is good on a lot of issues, bad on guns.
[00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.092]  And that's a key issue, so you can't vote for him.
[00:26:29.112 --> 00:26:32.275]  I mean, he wants to ban them, not just start restricting.
[00:26:32.675 --> 00:26:36.198]  At least he's honest about it, because any restriction is moving towards a ban.
[00:26:37.379 --> 00:26:39.781]  Obama's bad news, total new world order.
[00:26:39.861 --> 00:26:41.082]  Hillary is the worst.
[00:26:42.563 --> 00:26:43.984]  The whole Democratic field
[00:26:45.038 --> 00:27:13.593]  is uh... really a nightmare but then you've got the republican field and that is unbelievably frightening uh... with just that entire gaggle led by rudolph giuliani the son of a mob boss and all the things he's done himself let's not blame sons of the father or the fathers as they say and then you've got ron paul someone popular with democrats someone extremely popular with mainline conservatives who know who he is and know his policies
[00:27:14.227 --> 00:27:16.008]  He's able to talk sense into people.
[00:27:16.048 --> 00:27:18.310]  He's got the Libertarians at his feet.
[00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.371]  He's got the Greens at his feet.
[00:27:20.751 --> 00:27:25.174]  He is founding father, once-in-a-lifetime material.
[00:27:26.756 --> 00:27:30.358]  He is literally the constitutional populist.
[00:27:30.398 --> 00:27:34.621]  If you want to make a term for Ron Paul, he's a constitutional populist.
[00:27:35.261 --> 00:27:37.443]  And he fits the bill for victory.
[00:27:38.143 --> 00:27:40.725]  And he's risking his life, make no mistake,
[00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:42.871]  He said it on the show.
[00:27:43.291 --> 00:27:44.332]  He said he knows there's risk.
[00:27:44.572 --> 00:27:45.352]  He's told me all fair.
[00:27:45.392 --> 00:27:46.293]  He knows it's dangerous.
[00:27:46.573 --> 00:27:48.394]  We've got to get a headline out on that and commend him.
[00:27:50.155 --> 00:27:51.076]  And what does he get?
[00:27:51.456 --> 00:27:55.558]  He goes in and wins every major poll, scientific and unscientific.
[00:27:56.059 --> 00:27:57.159]  There were more than 10 of them.
[00:27:57.199 --> 00:27:59.281]  We linked to all of them and posted the results.
[00:28:00.121 --> 00:28:09.527]  I mean, we're talking 94% in a MSNBC poll, where it was an IP address poll, one time per computer.
[00:28:10.131 --> 00:28:13.639]  Which is a lot of studies are showing, more scientific than even Gallup polls.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.744]  He won that!
[00:28:17.859 --> 00:28:19.280]  He won that.
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.622]  Then he was winning by 33 points.
[00:28:21.922 --> 00:28:25.665]  Then he started saying, oh, Sean Hannity, I'm going to text message in against Ron Paul.
[00:28:25.925 --> 00:28:27.086]  Again, leading the audience.
[00:28:29.028 --> 00:28:32.010]  Other White House operatives going, oh, people are starting to text against Paul.
[00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:32.631]  He's going down.
[00:28:33.071 --> 00:28:39.676]  And he got second place with Mitt Romney beating him by two points in a field of 10 in a clearly rigged deal.
[00:28:39.936 --> 00:28:45.861]  Then they come out and say he rigged it and that people were text messaging over the internet, which is not the case.
[00:28:46.804 --> 00:28:48.785]  And God forbid young people be involved.
[00:28:48.985 --> 00:28:51.667]  They're always whining about how they aren't involved, but they actually love it.
[00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:57.831]  And so now we stand here.
[00:28:58.291 --> 00:28:59.912]  Oh, by the way, here's the headline.
[00:29:02.034 --> 00:29:06.296]  Republican Party calls for Ron Paul to be removed from debate.
[00:29:06.677 --> 00:29:08.338]  Now we saw the head of GOPAC.
[00:29:08.378 --> 00:29:09.478]  We played that clip yesterday.
[00:29:09.498 --> 00:29:14.882]  In fact, it's 2 minutes 34 seconds in to that clip of, it's the clip we titled
[00:29:16.147 --> 00:29:18.208]  Slander clip or defamation clip of Paul.
[00:29:19.209 --> 00:29:21.470]  That compilation Aaron did until four in the morning the other night.
[00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.772]  When we get back, we'll play him and he gave the orders.
[00:29:25.832 --> 00:29:26.973]  We need to get him out of the party.
[00:29:26.993 --> 00:29:28.454]  We need to get him out of the debates.
[00:29:28.914 --> 00:29:29.775]  He doesn't need to be up there.
[00:29:29.995 --> 00:29:30.575]  He's winning.
[00:29:30.915 --> 00:29:32.256]  He's got the sheep waking up.
[00:29:32.576 --> 00:29:34.017]  We need to keep him on the plantation.
[00:29:36.098 --> 00:29:38.799]  Here it is, headline, Ron Paul Debate Band.
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.481]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:42.415 --> 00:29:47.700]  The Republican Party has officially called for him to be removed this just in.
[00:29:52.024 --> 00:29:55.027]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.948 --> 00:29:58.631]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.003 --> 00:30:06.647]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:30:06.707 --> 00:30:07.467]  have diabetes.
[00:30:07.748 --> 00:30:14.713]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:30:14.853 --> 00:30:19.397]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:30:19.577 --> 00:30:22.399]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:32:06.186 --> 00:32:10.047]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[00:32:10.407 --> 00:32:15.428]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[00:32:15.708 --> 00:32:26.891]  Electrolyzed plus water will alkalize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[00:32:27.231 --> 00:32:31.574]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and environmentally safe for humans and animals.
[00:32:31.814 --> 00:32:41.160]  Alkaline water is available as a concentrate to be mixed with good, filtered, purified RO water, but not tap water, micro-structured alkaline antioxidant water for consumption.
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:50.946]  Call for your Electrolyzed Plus Alkalinizing Miracle Rejuvenating Water Concentrate or other remarkable RPA Biotech products like Ultimate Fuel, Sport Performance Drink, at 888-212-8871

[00:32:57.695 --> 00:33:00.019]  That's N-U-T-R-I with an I, medical.com.
[00:33:26.503 --> 00:33:26.723]  What?
[00:33:27.324 --> 00:33:35.448]  I just... I am going to cancel the guest who was arrested and put in jail for months and months and months for videotaping a police riot.
[00:33:36.989 --> 00:33:37.309]  Literally.
[00:33:37.329 --> 00:33:38.790]  They just said you're not allowed to videotape us.
[00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:39.411]  It's Al Qaeda.
[00:33:39.451 --> 00:33:40.051]  We're arresting him.
[00:33:40.491 --> 00:33:41.492]  Everything's Al Qaeda now.
[00:33:41.512 --> 00:33:45.034]  We're just going to have to reschedule him and have a whole free speech show.
[00:33:45.074 --> 00:33:46.315]  And I'm going to cancel Pallast again.
[00:33:46.355 --> 00:33:47.395]  I had him coming on yesterday.
[00:33:47.755 --> 00:33:48.616]  This is too important.
[00:33:48.636 --> 00:33:49.877]  I haven't even gotten your calls yet.
[00:33:49.897 --> 00:33:50.877]  I have tons of clips.
[00:33:51.378 --> 00:33:52.959]  I have all these points I want to make.
[00:33:52.979 --> 00:33:55.320]  Let me just boil it down real fast.
[00:33:56.284 --> 00:33:58.505]  Only Ron Paul can defeat Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:58.525 --> 00:33:59.165]  We know that.
[00:34:00.265 --> 00:34:14.070]  Ron Paul had won the first debate, clearly got the most attention, even though they tried to give Giuliani more time and others more time, and literally when they attacked him, this is key, it has now backfired on them and made him even more prominent.
[00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:18.052]  He's winning every poll on the internet, every scientific poll.
[00:34:18.132 --> 00:34:19.572]  They are now nationwide.
[00:34:19.812 --> 00:34:21.953]  They've been doing this for months, but now it's happening everywhere.
[00:34:22.433 --> 00:34:26.634]  Removing him from the different polls all together.
[00:34:26.955 --> 00:34:41.719]  He's being censored on MySpace, YouTube, I'm now being censored everywhere because they are scared of our growth curve at PrisonPlanet.com especially but also Infowars.com and everything together because they know we're just going straight for the stratosphere and they don't stop us.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.840]  And it's the same thing with Ron Paul.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.981]  We're all in this together.
[00:34:47.061 --> 00:34:48.542]  It is viral as they say.
[00:34:48.602 --> 00:34:49.342]  They are scared.
[00:34:50.268 --> 00:34:51.108]  So what do they do?
[00:34:51.188 --> 00:35:00.271]  He wins the first debate, he clearly wins the second debate, he wins all the polls, but gets second place in the last Fox one, but was winning all night until it suddenly closed and magically they announced him.
[00:35:00.532 --> 00:35:04.513]  He lost by two points, second place, to Mip Romney in a ten horse race.
[00:35:05.279 --> 00:35:06.779]  That's amazing victory right there!
[00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:08.440]  He is now the front-runner.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:14.861]  Ron Paul is the front-runner with the intelligentsia.
[00:35:15.041 --> 00:35:18.762]  With people that can actually think, and people that are actually politically involved.
[00:35:19.082 --> 00:35:30.284]  If you go talk to registered voters in a poll, and they've got these polls out there, and you go talk to people who have education and are informed, because remember, yeah, there's a lot of the public that doesn't even know who he is.
[00:35:30.884 --> 00:35:33.025]  That same public doesn't know who the Vice President is.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.782]  See, they're doing polls of people that aren't even voters.
[00:35:37.224 --> 00:35:39.607]  Those are the ones they hand around where Giuliani's the frontrunner.
[00:35:39.887 --> 00:35:43.812]  That's just because they've heard of him because of all of his 9-11 grandstanding.
[00:35:45.854 --> 00:35:50.119]  Which is, again, more than I can handle to see someone involved in the attacks always grandstanding.
[00:35:50.159 --> 00:35:54.524]  It's just... God, when it all comes out, you guys are in a lot of trouble and you know that.
[00:35:55.689 --> 00:35:58.590]  Can we handle it as a society, though, for it to publicly be admitted?
[00:35:59.191 --> 00:36:03.513]  Like JFK assassination now is, now, fait accompli, coup de grace, whatever.
[00:36:03.533 --> 00:36:05.313]  It's just, it's done.
[00:36:07.354 --> 00:36:07.835]  It's done.
[00:36:08.155 --> 00:36:08.515]  It's known.
[00:36:09.528 --> 00:36:10.569]  You will not stop us.
[00:36:10.629 --> 00:36:11.849]  You ship in the narcotics.
[00:36:12.189 --> 00:36:14.010]  You push the legal prescription drugs.
[00:36:14.331 --> 00:36:16.172]  You run most of the child kidnapping rings.
[00:36:16.652 --> 00:36:17.332]  You run it all.
[00:36:17.592 --> 00:36:18.313]  I mean, it's dirty.
[00:36:18.353 --> 00:36:21.234]  I mean, folks, the world narcotics trade is $700 billion.
[00:36:21.554 --> 00:36:22.995]  It's now over $300 billion a year.
[00:36:23.035 --> 00:36:26.037]  It's grown because of inflation in the United States alone.
[00:36:26.807 --> 00:36:31.148]  I mean, yeah, you think some junkie in New York's running that, yeah.
[00:36:31.168 --> 00:36:32.909]  700 billion a year, just so.
[00:36:33.189 --> 00:36:39.671]  And then they find your teenager with it, and they put them in these death camps where they get raped, and then nobody even gets in trouble in Texas.
[00:36:41.491 --> 00:36:44.732]  But let me just, I know we got a lot of callers, and a lot of clips I want to get to.
[00:36:44.752 --> 00:36:46.652]  And the toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:36:46.672 --> 00:36:47.873]  We have history in our hands.
[00:36:53.098 --> 00:36:58.721]  We have Ron Paul, clearly the frontrunner, winning the major polls over and over again.
[00:36:59.182 --> 00:37:02.504]  We're talking it's got to be, you know, 29 times out of 30.
[00:37:02.624 --> 00:37:06.046]  I mean, I've seen at least 30, 40 polls and he's only lost one of them.
[00:37:06.266 --> 00:37:07.487]  And that he got second place in.
[00:37:07.507 --> 00:37:13.090]  And again, it was black ops, Fox throwing fits and rigging things and telling people to go vote against Paul.
[00:37:13.751 --> 00:37:15.592]  I mean, that on its face, they rigged it.
[00:37:16.132 --> 00:37:20.054]  And I think there's more to it because they usually steal votes if they close them, then it changes.
[00:37:20.094 --> 00:37:20.875]  That's what you got to watch.
[00:37:23.018 --> 00:37:45.188]  So, and they're panicking, they're scared, I can see it in Gibson's eyes, I can see it in Malcolm's eyes, and again, you should be scared, because you know what you're doing, and you know who you're working for, and those fancy apartments in New York, and the fancy cars, and the servants, and the little jewelry, it sets heavy upon your crown, doesn't it?
[00:37:45.268 --> 00:37:51.091]  And you know every day, you just, your sack's a traitorous trash.
[00:37:52.472 --> 00:37:53.773]  That's all I got to say to you.
[00:37:55.194 --> 00:37:58.657]  And we are standing in the gates of history right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:58.697 --> 00:38:00.619]  We've got to ram Ron Paul through.
[00:38:00.659 --> 00:38:09.306]  We've got to re-double and then re-double and then re-double and then re-double our efforts to make videos promoting Ron Paul and what he's doing.
[00:38:09.746 --> 00:38:19.294]  To text message, to vote in the polls, to call into radio talk shows, to write articles, to start your own blogs, to donate to his campaign.
[00:38:21.244 --> 00:38:23.466]  Because this is more than just Ron Paul.
[00:38:23.506 --> 00:38:29.430]  This is about the people trying to stand up and trying to do the right thing and saying, hey, we want a constitutionalist.
[00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:33.513]  We want the old America back and to move forward into the 21st century.
[00:38:33.793 --> 00:38:36.175]  We don't want to go bomb innocent countries in our name.
[00:38:36.455 --> 00:38:37.956]  We don't want to put people in camps.
[00:38:38.236 --> 00:38:39.537]  We want to control our borders.
[00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:40.878]  We're against abortion.
[00:38:41.238 --> 00:38:47.499]  You know, the left has all heard, the grassroots left has heard him and they're saying on blogs, well, I don't care about those issues.
[00:38:47.619 --> 00:38:49.620]  Okay, maybe he's right about that.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.120]  I'm just for Ron Paul.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.560]  Because deep down they know he's good.
[00:38:53.901 --> 00:38:55.781]  And deep down they know he's what we need.
[00:38:56.001 --> 00:39:04.663]  And deep down they know that rotten alternative of those filthy establishment Democrats is just more cyanide on top of arsenic.
[00:39:05.103 --> 00:39:06.183]  It isn't going to cure you.
[00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:12.910]  And they could see... I'll tell you what's caused the sensation.
[00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.671]  I saw this and I mentioned this yesterday.
[00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:17.171]  I guess it happened Monday.
[00:39:17.651 --> 00:39:18.812]  Yeah, I mentioned it yesterday then.
[00:39:19.872 --> 00:39:23.813]  No, it's already... It's already Thursday.
[00:39:23.853 --> 00:39:25.794]  So yeah, no, I mentioned it Tuesday.
[00:39:26.494 --> 00:39:27.194]  Two days ago.
[00:39:27.755 --> 00:39:32.936]  That... That Hannity was very uncomfortable.
[00:39:34.537 --> 00:39:35.497]  Very uncomfortable.
[00:39:36.497 --> 00:39:38.398]  And he was trying to do that little snake...
[00:39:39.275 --> 00:39:48.062]  thing where he arrogantly with fake indignation, a little bully punk he is, tried to radiate, because that's what men do at that level of power.
[00:39:49.002 --> 00:39:50.283]  It's a little jousting they do.
[00:39:50.904 --> 00:39:54.126]  Really freaks them out when you've gotten conditioned to just ignore it and it just bounces off.
[00:39:54.166 --> 00:39:56.568]  I don't even notice it, folks.
[00:39:57.729 --> 00:40:01.852]  He tries to radiate hatred and basically says that Paul's a traitor and how dare him.
[00:40:02.172 --> 00:40:03.433]  And Paul gets in his space.
[00:40:03.953 --> 00:40:07.576]  Ron Paul just leans over and smiles at him.
[00:40:08.764 --> 00:40:17.506]  And he didn't get too much into his face, but he just leaned over towards him, started talking to him real calmly and smiling at him, like, I know you're a piece of garbage.
[00:40:17.586 --> 00:40:19.227]  I know you're a little nothing with no honor.
[00:40:19.727 --> 00:40:21.027]  You're on the wrong side of history.
[00:40:21.227 --> 00:40:22.647]  That was all said non-verbally.
[00:40:23.147 --> 00:40:23.628]  Look at you.
[00:40:23.648 --> 00:40:24.448]  Look what you've done.
[00:40:24.868 --> 00:40:26.048]  Look at how weak you are.
[00:40:27.749 --> 00:40:28.669]  You don't have any history.
[00:40:28.689 --> 00:40:29.589]  You don't have any facts.
[00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:30.969]  You're just a cheerleader.
[00:40:31.189 --> 00:40:31.970]  You're a toady.
[00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:33.870]  You're nothing but a sycophant.
[00:40:34.355 --> 00:40:39.719]  You're nothing but a pilot fish that follows a giant lump of detritus floating down the sewer.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.581]  That's all you are.
[00:40:44.142 --> 00:40:45.003]  You're a parasite.
[00:40:45.743 --> 00:40:47.685]  And Hannity literally shivers.
[00:40:47.725 --> 00:40:48.585]  You can see it on the tape.
[00:40:48.625 --> 00:40:50.387]  He shivers and leans back.
[00:40:50.607 --> 00:40:51.167]  That's right!
[00:40:51.187 --> 00:40:53.729]  You better shiver, you little evil twit!
[00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:57.732]  Because the Sword of Truth is going to deal with you!
[00:41:00.367 --> 00:41:02.529]  And it doesn't mean we're going to win this fight for Paul.
[00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:05.852]  It doesn't mean we're going to win this fight for America this week or this year.
[00:41:06.813 --> 00:41:11.256]  What it means is we're going to fight as hard as we can and build those muscles for fighting.
[00:41:11.717 --> 00:41:13.759]  This is like weightlifting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:14.279 --> 00:41:17.382]  And so many people see a big weight in front of them, they say, I can't lift that.
[00:41:17.762 --> 00:41:18.763]  I can't have an effect.
[00:41:19.123 --> 00:41:20.004]  I can't get involved.
[00:41:20.044 --> 00:41:20.805]  It's too big.
[00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:21.906]  It's too powerful.
[00:41:22.106 --> 00:41:23.227]  Look at the size of it.
[00:41:23.587 --> 00:41:24.408]  What are we going to do?
[00:41:24.428 --> 00:41:26.730]  And I've always told you folks, just start.
[00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:28.091]  It's what Jimmy Vonsa on this show.
[00:41:30.217 --> 00:41:32.519]  You don't have to move the rock, you just gotta push it.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.703]  And I'm telling you folks, enough of us push it, it's gonna move.
[00:41:36.723 --> 00:41:50.396]  In fact, that's the slogan and the great graphic Aaron Dykes put together up on JonesReport.com for our Truth Jam contest and the $1,000 prize that'll be announced June 14th for the best 1-5 minute video for 9-11 Truth.
[00:41:52.955 --> 00:41:53.736]  Go look at the rules.
[00:41:53.776 --> 00:41:54.717]  It's real easy to do.
[00:41:54.797 --> 00:41:55.617]  Make your video.
[00:41:55.958 --> 00:41:57.399]  Upload it to Google or YouTube.
[00:41:57.819 --> 00:41:58.400]  Email us.
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:00.161]  We're going to post all the good entries.
[00:42:00.982 --> 00:42:02.764]  We'll just post them all unless any of them are vulgar.
[00:42:02.784 --> 00:42:03.484]  We're not going to do that.
[00:42:04.705 --> 00:42:06.627]  And we'll get them all up on the site.
[00:42:06.687 --> 00:42:07.748]  Your work will get seen.
[00:42:08.388 --> 00:42:09.569]  Number one, get out to people.
[00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:11.831]  We'll get new 9-11 trick material.
[00:42:12.252 --> 00:42:13.333]  And folks will get rewarded with $1,000.
[00:42:13.373 --> 00:42:16.435]  And I'm going to give you like 40, 50 DVDs.
[00:42:16.475 --> 00:42:17.997]  I've already sent them to give you a whole bunch.
[00:42:19.841 --> 00:42:26.487]  On top of the thousand dollars, but that aside, I thought of it because there's the image of some people pushing the big boulder up the hill.
[00:42:27.748 --> 00:42:29.230]  And we're right up at the top right now.
[00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:30.571]  Right when it's hardest.
[00:42:31.852 --> 00:42:34.134]  And you just gotta start lifting weights, folks.
[00:42:34.615 --> 00:42:35.836]  Psychologically, mentally.
[00:42:36.476 --> 00:42:37.517]  Call in to talk radio.
[00:42:37.638 --> 00:42:39.860]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with that single step.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.783]  But it starts even before the step with a commitment and the decision.
[00:42:44.264 --> 00:42:45.565]  It's called setting your jaw.
[00:42:47.173 --> 00:42:51.395]  And I know I use this analogy a lot, but I mean, I think a lot of you have, let's say, just been in a fist fight.
[00:42:52.875 --> 00:43:03.379]  Or you're lined up playing football, and there is a really big, you know, you're a tight end, and there is just this huge linebacker that keeps running around the side and ringing your bell, I mean, hitting you hard.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:07.681]  And you just finally decide to gut up and knock him down.
[00:43:09.082 --> 00:43:14.564]  And it's the same thing in life, you know, when that big bully comes up, and he's big, and he's mean, he's got a big scar on his face.
[00:43:15.186 --> 00:43:16.767]  And he's hurt a lot of people.
[00:43:17.067 --> 00:43:18.607]  And you just finally say, you know what?
[00:43:19.168 --> 00:43:19.808]  Let it come.
[00:43:20.028 --> 00:43:20.748]  I'm going to hurt them.
[00:43:22.029 --> 00:43:23.849]  You just know you're going to hurt them.
[00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:25.570]  You just know you're going to win.
[00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:31.932]  It's that decision to put the mind in motion, ladies and gentlemen, to tell the brain what to do.
[00:43:32.953 --> 00:43:34.513]  To literally make a decision.
[00:43:35.113 --> 00:43:36.674]  And there's nothing going to stop you.
[00:43:37.701 --> 00:43:39.022]  It's called commitment.
[00:43:39.522 --> 00:43:41.183]  It's called dedication.
[00:43:41.743 --> 00:43:44.125]  It's called letting the chips fall where they may.
[00:43:44.365 --> 00:43:45.666]  You've noticed I've turned the heat up.
[00:43:45.906 --> 00:43:47.246]  I don't hold back anymore, folks.
[00:43:47.286 --> 00:43:52.029]  If I want to say something and I want to do it, I'm just going to say what I think and what I feel and what I know.
[00:43:52.689 --> 00:43:54.390]  No more holding back on anything.
[00:43:54.931 --> 00:43:56.251]  That's my commitment to you.
[00:43:57.052 --> 00:43:59.173]  I was known as being radical in your face years ago.
[00:43:59.233 --> 00:44:00.514]  Folks, you have no idea.
[00:44:00.534 --> 00:44:05.436]  And we're going to lay it out like it really is and we're going to fight these people.
[00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:06.677]  And some of us aren't going to make it.
[00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:08.579]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:44:08.619 --> 00:44:21.065]  The idea of liberty and freedom and decency and honor and the protection of the unborn and the protection of the weak, that is going to live on and that is going to win in this viral
[00:44:22.023 --> 00:44:22.704]  We're good to go!
[00:44:44.676 --> 00:44:55.161]  And there's going to be infections, and there's going to be pus, and there's going to be a lot of pain, ladies and gentlemen, but I'm telling you, we can win this fight and save the body politic.
[00:44:55.521 --> 00:44:56.721]  We can reverse this.
[00:44:56.841 --> 00:45:00.223]  We can turn it around if we take action and do it.
[00:45:02.484 --> 00:45:12.448]  Literally, ladies and gentlemen, see the heart of the American people and their will to resist, like the bone marrow where the soldier's cells are manufactured.
[00:45:13.869 --> 00:45:16.430]  And literally see yourself as that soldier's self.
[00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:21.231]  And take action with the mission of destroying the New World Order.
[00:45:21.791 --> 00:45:29.433]  And that starts by tearing down their lies and exposing them who wrap themselves in the flag and who say they're the patriots.
[00:45:30.813 --> 00:45:33.894]  They look fair, but they feel foul in your gut.
[00:45:34.274 --> 00:45:36.254]  You know they're foul devils.
[00:45:37.074 --> 00:45:39.495]  And we are going to defeat them.
[00:45:41.075 --> 00:45:43.216]  So set your mind in motion.
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:45.120]  Lock it!
[00:45:46.781 --> 00:45:47.381]  Commit!
[00:45:50.141 --> 00:45:52.522]  And you know, all of us have got our own tick.
[00:45:52.562 --> 00:45:55.362]  We're setting our, just, most people, it's setting their jaw.
[00:45:55.762 --> 00:45:57.103]  It's clenching their teeth together.
[00:46:00.223 --> 00:46:05.424]  Just clench, just set your teeth together and just know you're going in 110%.
[00:46:07.205 --> 00:46:09.025]  Let the chips fall where they may.
[00:46:10.225 --> 00:46:12.106]  This is a game of chicken where if we
[00:46:13.994 --> 00:46:16.695]  If we blink, we lose.
[00:46:16.795 --> 00:46:24.239]  We win by going head-on into them, ladies and gentlemen, because even if it destroys the warriors, that's what our job is.
[00:46:24.339 --> 00:46:29.181]  Even if we personally, personally are destroyed, the people behind us win.
[00:46:31.189 --> 00:46:57.004]  And so just step on the accelerator with 700 horsepower beneath you and just keep it straight down the road and you and the new order already knows folks that's why they're getting scared they know we're not they can feel it as they come down that blacktop to 200 yards away from us with each car going 160 miles an hour towards each other and they know we're not going to blink and they know they can't turn back and we're going to ram them straight to hell!
[00:47:06.241 --> 00:47:07.062]  It's that simple.
[00:47:09.824 --> 00:47:13.006]  These people aren't just boss hog crooks.
[00:47:14.227 --> 00:47:15.689]  They are wicked!
[00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:18.271]  They are bad!
[00:47:18.951 --> 00:47:20.352]  They love it!
[00:47:20.793 --> 00:47:22.474]  They love hurting innocent people.
[00:47:22.974 --> 00:47:24.856]  They love all the wicked things they do.
[00:47:25.456 --> 00:47:28.159]  They care about no one but themselves, at the bare minimum.
[00:47:28.279 --> 00:47:29.119]  They're sociopaths.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:33.443]  Most of them revel in sadistic wickedness.
[00:47:34.577 --> 00:47:36.258]  And they just need to be dealt with.
[00:47:38.679 --> 00:47:44.102]  It's like you deal with a rattlesnake in your backyard or a black widow in your closet, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:45.063 --> 00:47:46.403]  They just need to be dealt with.
[00:47:46.423 --> 00:47:52.547]  They need to stop breeding and multiplying and giggling and snickering at us and laughing every day.
[00:47:53.227 --> 00:47:54.228]  It is not going to work.
[00:47:54.708 --> 00:47:57.509]  Now I know I told you I take a lot of calls and we've canceled the next guest.
[00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:00.531]  And so we're going to do that.
[00:48:02.009 --> 00:48:05.171]  But I will restate it as calmly as I can because this is so important.
[00:48:05.611 --> 00:48:19.319]  I want you to go to PresidentPlanet.com and I want you to get the articles Paul Watson has written and the article he's about to write and I want you to get the word out that not just free speech and not just the people's electoral will.
[00:48:19.459 --> 00:48:20.520]  They want Ron Paul.
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.620]  They need Ron Paul.
[00:48:22.401 --> 00:48:24.622]  He is a wonderful candidate.
[00:48:24.922 --> 00:48:26.743]  He is light years better than somebody
[00:48:28.647 --> 00:48:33.991]  Like Barry Goldwater, who had some serious faults, folks, and had a lot of bad votes as a Senator.
[00:48:34.992 --> 00:48:43.238]  They try to compare Paul as like some vestigial remnant of Goldwater Republicanism.
[00:48:43.278 --> 00:48:44.259]  That is not true.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.981]  Ron Paul is a Constitutionalist.
[00:48:47.321 --> 00:48:49.343]  They try to confuse it if you're not in the right party.
[00:48:49.803 --> 00:48:51.504]  It doesn't matter what party he's in.
[00:48:51.845 --> 00:48:55.988]  He's a Constitutionalist limited government who wants to
[00:48:56.858 --> 00:48:59.159]  Defeat the New World Order and save America.
[00:49:00.399 --> 00:49:04.980]  And we have a real chance, if we get really aggressive, to ram him out there.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.421]  Now, they are trying to ban him from the debates right now.
[00:49:11.542 --> 00:49:23.005]  They are trying to ban him from the debates, and different Republican Party offices all over the state, all over the country, and the Republican Party head of GOPAC, and we have that clip.
[00:49:23.025 --> 00:49:23.705]  Did you cue that up?
[00:49:26.175 --> 00:49:27.255]  We're going to play that in a moment.
[00:49:28.196 --> 00:49:39.680]  They're saying Ron Paul debate ban, Saul Aneirza's, chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, says he wants to bar Texas Congressman Ron Paul from the future GOP presidential debates.
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:47.283]  He intends to circulate a petition among Republican National Committee members, debate sponsors, and broadcasters to keep Paul out of debates.
[00:49:48.121 --> 00:49:49.762]  He's already banned all over the place.
[00:49:50.342 --> 00:49:52.142]  Yahoo, MySpace.
[00:49:52.182 --> 00:49:54.823]  There's certain ways to get around it and still pause, but bulletins are banned.
[00:49:55.224 --> 00:49:56.544]  MySpace admits I'm banned.
[00:49:57.004 --> 00:49:59.485]  See, there's a reason they're doing this, because they're scared.
[00:50:05.507 --> 00:50:13.210]  But his actions are being contested by Ron Paul supporter, Dina Turner, who has launched the Ron Paul RNC participation petition.
[00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:14.810]  Get her on.
[00:50:15.231 --> 00:50:16.051]  We need to get her on.
[00:50:16.727 --> 00:50:21.613]  to Republican National Committee to ensure that Ron Paul continues to take part in the debates.
[00:50:22.014 --> 00:50:28.182]  Her petition, as of the morning of May 17th, had already garnered several hundred signatures.
[00:50:31.184 --> 00:50:38.571]  The Republican Party Chairman in Michigan was angered by remarks made two days ago in the second Republican debate when Ron Paul claimed the U.S.
[00:50:38.611 --> 00:50:41.793]  provocations in Iraq contributed to the current war on terror.
[00:50:42.454 --> 00:50:49.200]  Every CIA report, every university study, that's admitted fact.
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:57.948]  You don't bring that into the Cocoa for Cocoa Puffs, Alice in Wonderland, delusional world of CIA, CNN, and Fox.
[00:51:04.602 --> 00:51:10.065]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.425 --> 00:51:18.029]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:25.824]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.224 --> 00:51:37.650]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:41.893]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.913 --> 00:51:43.834]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.174 --> 00:51:48.036]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:01.252 --> 00:53:02.953]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.193 --> 00:53:06.894]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:07.214 --> 00:53:16.138]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.298 --> 00:53:21.180]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:30.423]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[00:53:30.743 --> 00:53:36.764]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.
[00:53:37.004 --> 00:53:39.565]  Turn your internet on and off with one simple
[00:53:39.565 --> 00:53:40.065]  I think so.
[00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:07.835]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.496 --> 00:54:10.818]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:27.464 --> 00:54:39.313]  I have wiped the decks clean with guests so we can get you up and on the air.
[00:54:41.775 --> 00:54:43.896]  We are definitely getting the attention of the New World Order.
[00:54:46.178 --> 00:54:49.841]  John just had the Discovery Channel calling up the network asking about the different shows.
[00:54:51.242 --> 00:54:53.804]  He was just telling John he's got to watch the national media.
[00:54:53.824 --> 00:54:55.445]  They're a bucket of snakes, but I'll
[00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:59.653]  I know we've got Jeremiah, Ernie, Ken, Tim, Chris, everybody else.
[00:54:59.673 --> 00:55:02.976]  We're going to go to you as soon as the next hour starts.
[00:55:02.996 --> 00:55:06.339]  Here's the head of GOPAC, the biggest Republican
[00:55:15.246 --> 00:55:19.548]  Um, action committee, saying he doesn't think Ron Paul should be in the debates.
[00:55:19.988 --> 00:55:25.209]  And now all over the country they've got different RNC heads and, uh, state levels calling for him to be removed.
[00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:27.290]  Because what do you expect from these people?
[00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:28.891]  That's how they deal with speech.
[00:55:28.911 --> 00:55:29.771]  They try to restrict it.
[00:55:30.211 --> 00:55:31.432]  Oh, you're winning the debates!
[00:55:31.572 --> 00:55:32.312]  Oh my gosh!
[00:55:32.612 --> 00:55:33.892]  You're actually a conservative!
[00:55:34.052 --> 00:55:35.193]  Oh, we better remove you!
[00:55:35.573 --> 00:55:38.574]  Don't you know we've hijacked the party and are using it to destroy America?
[00:55:39.497 --> 00:55:40.999]  We must get rid of Ron Paul!
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:45.385]  Oh my gosh, the real conservatives are going to find out that we're a bunch of scallywags!
[00:55:45.425 --> 00:55:45.865]  Here it is!
[00:55:52.313 --> 00:55:56.796]  I disagreed with Ron Paul winning that, but I haven't sent in my text vote yet because I've been busy working.
[00:55:56.816 --> 00:55:57.336]  I haven't seen it.
[00:55:57.816 --> 00:56:00.818]  Here's a current look at the results of our text message poll.
[00:56:00.858 --> 00:56:02.939]  In first place, Mitt Romney, 27 percent.
[00:56:02.979 --> 00:56:06.221]  In a very close second place, Ron Paul, 26 percent.
[00:56:06.261 --> 00:56:08.842]  In third place, Rudy Giuliani with 18 percent.
[00:56:09.203 --> 00:56:15.226]  And back with us now, former Democratic pollster Pat Goodell and GOPAC Chairman Michael Steele, both are Fox News contributors.
[00:56:15.606 --> 00:56:16.547]  Michael, what does it say?
[00:56:16.867 --> 00:56:20.409]  That here you have, throughout the night, Ron Paul slipping just 1 percent, but getting
[00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:27.056]  Ahead all night, perhaps the most controversial statement of the entire debate, and at variance with everybody else in the Republican field.
[00:56:27.096 --> 00:56:31.261]  What does it say that he's doing so well in our text messaging among those watching Fox News?
[00:56:31.281 --> 00:56:32.782]  To be honest, it says absolutely nothing.
[00:56:32.882 --> 00:56:36.126]  It says that he's got a lot of folks out there who's going to text message for him.
[00:56:37.507 --> 00:56:41.692]  In my view, there was clear separation between those who should be in this campaign and those who shouldn't.
[00:56:42.113 --> 00:56:43.334]  Based on what?
[00:56:43.454 --> 00:56:50.963]  Well, based on their responses to the questions, their responses to where they're going to move, like to move forward.
[00:56:51.023 --> 00:56:51.984]  Who should not be in the campaign, then?
[00:56:52.384 --> 00:56:54.545]  Well, that's a judgment the party's going to have to make.
[00:56:54.625 --> 00:56:58.428]  In my view, I think Paul, in my view, hurt himself tonight a little bit.
[00:56:58.728 --> 00:57:00.049]  Why don't you go by that text poll?
[00:57:00.089 --> 00:57:01.730]  Well, again, I'm not going to look at a text poll.
[00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:03.791]  I'm going to look at my reaction to it.
[00:57:14.435 --> 00:57:15.335]  Here's the interesting thing.
[00:57:15.696 --> 00:57:19.317]  The Republican Party, National Review, wrote an article two weeks ago admitting it.
[00:57:19.697 --> 00:57:21.058]  They are going to lose.
[00:57:21.458 --> 00:57:22.658]  Absolutely guaranteed.
[00:57:22.878 --> 00:57:23.739]  Totally hated.
[00:57:24.199 --> 00:57:25.539]  The candidates are all weak.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:27.700]  Only Ron Paul can win.
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:29.261]  This is how the parties work, though.
[00:57:29.781 --> 00:57:30.621]  At least since Kennedy.
[00:57:30.962 --> 00:57:32.362]  They pass the baton.
[00:57:33.163 --> 00:57:39.265]  There's all the famous photos and minutes, the meetings between Nixon and LBJ when they made the decision for him not to run again.
[00:57:39.904 --> 00:57:45.589]  Folks, they've been staging that stuff, you know, George Bush Senior not even campaigning, going to Bilderberg, letting Clinton have it.
[00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:49.352]  I mean, they literally, I mean, look at the Tories.
[00:57:50.733 --> 00:57:55.396]  And I mean, look at Gordon Brown and look at Tony Blair just passing the baton.
[00:57:57.398 --> 00:57:58.379]  This is what they do.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:01.681]  And that's what these guys do on the team.
[00:58:01.721 --> 00:58:02.682]  There's one team.
[00:58:02.762 --> 00:58:04.123]  It's their team against the people.
[00:58:04.944 --> 00:58:06.165]  And they sit up there and foolish,
[00:58:07.632 --> 00:58:09.253]  Yeah, I mean, just like two killer whales.
[00:58:09.373 --> 00:58:15.677]  One will run up and get the seals to run one direction while the other killer whale is waiting to eat them.
[00:58:15.857 --> 00:58:16.838]  And they share the meat.
[00:58:17.258 --> 00:58:18.059]  Wolves do it, too.
[00:58:18.119 --> 00:58:19.199]  It's a basic trick.
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:20.540]  It's a hunting trick.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:21.761]  They're hunting us, politically.
[00:58:22.962 --> 00:58:24.863]  Yeah, Mr. Steele, you're such a traitor.
[00:58:26.087 --> 00:58:28.508]  Yeah, the people want Ron Paul, so we better not have him.
[00:58:28.908 --> 00:58:31.930]  So you can go around with your pinky ring and your $5,000 suit.
[00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:34.531]  I've watched that guy sit there and adjust himself.
[00:58:34.631 --> 00:58:37.332]  Man, that's what all these pimp politicians do, man.
[00:58:37.372 --> 00:58:38.913]  They worship themselves.
[00:58:39.833 --> 00:58:40.834]  Sick piece of crap.
[00:58:41.394 --> 00:58:45.976]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.957 --> 00:58:58.597]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.258 --> 00:59:00.298]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.019 --> 00:59:02.140]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.601]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.362 --> 00:59:05.262]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.903 --> 00:59:09.726]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.106 --> 00:59:14.190]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:26.996]  Well, it's backfired on Fox News and the New World Order trying to censure Ron Paul, demonizing him, now calling for him not to be in the debates.
[00:59:28.317 --> 00:59:32.780]  They basically came out on Fox and said that I'm an evil leader of this whole thing.
[00:59:33.801 --> 00:59:38.484]  Just as Alan Combs has said, apparently I don't like that position at absolute tip of the spear.
[00:59:39.905 --> 00:59:43.608]  But they've attacked myself, Ron Paul, they're attacking Ron Paul's.
[00:59:44.432 --> 01:00:10.644]  Campaign because he quote comes on this show nationally saying he should be banned on Fox from my show I mean from from the national debates because he comes on this show Hey scumbags there at the government that run Fox that run the you know that when I say government the foreign corporations that own our government are using it like a sock puppet to do their will Ron Paul, I'm one of his constituents, you know I'm used to his
[01:00:12.046 --> 01:00:12.446]  Yes, we are.
[01:00:37.466 --> 01:00:40.668]  Frankly, I can feel the eye of Sauron looking right at me right now.
[01:00:41.528 --> 01:00:44.870]  But, as they say, that's a joke, New York Times.
[01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:46.130]  Don't quote me on that.
[01:00:47.551 --> 01:00:48.672]  It's just amazing.
[01:00:48.872 --> 01:00:49.832]  We will play the clip.
[01:00:49.852 --> 01:00:53.614]  You know, the internet, sometimes audio is bad on the net, and we found a couple different clips.
[01:00:53.634 --> 01:00:54.555]  We found the best one.
[01:00:54.575 --> 01:01:01.798]  It's still not spotless, but we will air this enemy transmission so we can analyze it and comment and critique it under the First Amendment.
[01:01:04.409 --> 01:01:06.391]  You know, Fox, again, knows who I am.
[01:01:06.431 --> 01:01:09.574]  I've talked to multiple producers who've called me and they go, listen, we want to set you up.
[01:01:10.534 --> 01:01:11.475]  By the way, I'm a fan.
[01:01:11.515 --> 01:01:13.877]  I like your video, but we're not allowed to.
[01:01:14.558 --> 01:01:15.519]  And they always set me up.
[01:01:15.559 --> 01:01:18.762]  It's probably happened 15 times, I'd guess, over the last five, six years.
[01:01:19.182 --> 01:01:22.725]  And they always later go, I'm sorry, higher ups said you can't come on.
[01:01:22.785 --> 01:01:28.290]  I go, Ailes, Viet Dinh, I can't tell you, but I sure like your videos.
[01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:31.091]  Same thing at CNN.
[01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:34.633]  Oh man, we're getting the record ratings with you on about this on Showtime.
[01:01:34.653 --> 01:01:36.134]  You know, tonight.
[01:01:36.174 --> 01:01:36.954]  Showbiz Tonight.
[01:01:37.614 --> 01:01:39.015]  Oh my God, we've never had this before.
[01:01:39.055 --> 01:01:41.016]  We just got a call over from the news division head.
[01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:42.257]  You're banned.
[01:01:42.297 --> 01:01:43.277]  You can't come back on.
[01:01:43.317 --> 01:01:44.798]  But please don't say it on air.
[01:01:44.858 --> 01:01:46.139]  Or at least wait a while.
[01:01:46.159 --> 01:01:47.400]  Or don't say who you heard it from.
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:53.503]  Next, Showbiz Tonight's being put late in the night.
[01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:54.264]  Not in prime time.
[01:01:54.324 --> 01:01:55.364]  And Glenn Beck's coming in.
[01:01:55.384 --> 01:01:56.865]  Glenn Beck program.
[01:01:56.885 --> 01:01:58.486]  Glenn Beck neocon program.
[01:02:00.029 --> 01:02:01.551]  All right, I want to give you all plenty of time.
[01:02:01.571 --> 01:02:20.130]  When we get back, I'm going to just shotgun through everybody that's holding 1-800-259-9231, have your question, your comment ready, and then I'm going to play this incredible hit job that they have done against Ron Paul and everybody else in the Patriot universe.
[01:02:21.156 --> 01:02:23.897]  And it is just, they're desperate.
[01:02:23.917 --> 01:02:24.877]  I think it's going to backfire.
[01:02:25.357 --> 01:02:26.177]  But see, they don't care.
[01:02:26.577 --> 01:02:33.819]  They've been emboldened by getting different movies banned and loose change kicked off Virgin and they think they got Rosie O'Donnell fired.
[01:02:33.879 --> 01:02:34.780]  O'Reilly announced that.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:42.462]  It's now been admitted by ABC and we had it already inside that she just wants to start her own show and didn't want a three-year contract and they were trying to censor her.
[01:02:42.542 --> 01:02:48.003]  So she's honorably, love her or hate her folks, you got to admire that she's turning down tens of millions a year.
[01:02:49.356 --> 01:02:56.641]  uh... and sponsorship and payment and all our products getting pitched on there uh... that to have her own free speech.
[01:02:56.681 --> 01:02:57.142]  She's leaving.
[01:02:57.842 --> 01:03:03.206]  So they even try to take her honor in not being censored and leaving and they say, oh she got fired.
[01:03:03.886 --> 01:03:07.208]  So they're making a desperate move to have him removed right now.
[01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:08.469]  Malkin has said it.
[01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:11.171]  The head of GOPAC has said it.
[01:03:11.691 --> 01:03:17.075]  Now the head of the Republican Party in Michigan, very important Republican state, has said it.
[01:03:17.911 --> 01:03:22.252]  The Republican chairman in Michigan is the third most powerful state chairman.
[01:03:22.552 --> 01:03:23.952]  It's California, Texas, Michigan.
[01:03:23.992 --> 01:03:24.852]  Don't ask me why.
[01:03:24.893 --> 01:03:27.833]  You'd think it'd be New York or Florida being number three.
[01:03:27.913 --> 01:03:28.333]  It's not.
[01:03:29.493 --> 01:03:31.014]  I've studied these politics in depth.
[01:03:31.094 --> 01:03:32.054]  I used to be a Republican.
[01:03:32.074 --> 01:03:38.295]  I did that three or four years before I really woke up.
[01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:46.617]  I've done it all, from at the voting centers, to putting up yard signs, to going to fundraisers and organizing them at the grassroots.
[01:03:47.344 --> 01:03:50.445]  And let me tell you what a group of painted trollops they are.
[01:03:50.465 --> 01:03:51.745]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:53.666 --> 01:03:59.907]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:00.247 --> 01:04:02.168]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.528 --> 01:04:10.170]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.876 --> 01:04:17.918]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.319 --> 01:04:29.762]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.062 --> 01:04:33.984]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.024 --> 01:04:35.944]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.285 --> 01:04:40.066]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.283 --> 01:05:01.548]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:05:01.809 --> 01:05:06.171]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:05:06.452 --> 01:05:15.377]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:19.200]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:24.527]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:05:24.807 --> 01:05:31.556]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:05:32.037 --> 01:05:32.577]  What about you?
[01:05:33.328 --> 01:05:38.670]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:05:55.071 --> 01:05:59.195]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:05:59.435 --> 01:06:01.176]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:07.742]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:06:08.022 --> 01:06:14.168]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:06:14.408 --> 01:06:20.333]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:06:20.333 --> 01:06:21.094]  I think so.
[01:06:38.797 --> 01:06:39.017]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:39.097]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:06:54.461 --> 01:07:00.082]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.122 --> 01:07:18.966]  Tellin' it like it is, defending the republic, 110% going after all enemies of this republic, because this is where we raise our families, this is America, and if it falls, it all falls.
[01:07:19.784 --> 01:07:29.347]  Alright, we're going to go to Jeremiah, Ernie, Ken, Tim, Chris, Flay Fox News, savaging the Congressman Ron Paul, saying he should be kicked out of the debates because he comes on my show.
[01:07:30.187 --> 01:07:31.748]  This is totally disgusting.
[01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:39.430]  And that he's given interviews to some local student 9-11 truthers, who by the way have called into this show and been guests here.
[01:07:40.406 --> 01:07:42.587]  I mean, they are tracking us very closely.
[01:07:43.987 --> 01:07:52.290]  State Legislator Jim Guest is enlisting in Missouri, and we're honored to have him as our first person on for a few minutes, and we'll go to all the calls.
[01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:55.091]  And he is organizing and working and helping Ron Paul.
[01:07:55.371 --> 01:08:01.733]  He also heads up Legislators Against Real ID, and we'll tell you all about that organization.
[01:08:02.253 --> 01:08:04.094]  And Jim, give us your take.
[01:08:04.654 --> 01:08:05.034]  You're right.
[01:08:05.054 --> 01:08:07.355]  If you're not getting close to the core of something, why all the uproar?
[01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:11.496]  You know, I've been following Ron Paul for three or four years here, and he's fighting for Americans' freedom.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:34.664]  When he said, you know, if we have a problem someplace in this world where the United States is, you know, maybe they need to sit up and listen to what he's saying.
[01:08:34.684 --> 01:08:38.807]  You know, he has been working and speaking for the American people for the last few years.
[01:08:39.467 --> 01:08:42.709]  And you have to question, you know, why they're so concerned about getting rid of him.
[01:08:42.769 --> 01:08:44.210]  Maybe he's getting close to the truth.
[01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:51.434]  Sometimes, you know, if you don't go along with the main part of the party or whatever's going on there, you're getting close to something.
[01:08:51.514 --> 01:08:53.375]  So I have to agree with you on that.
[01:08:54.767 --> 01:09:07.891]  Well, that's why he stands out, because they're all up there painted, you know, up in their makeup, their little suits, and all basically repeating the same thing, trying to adjust their ties and look authoritative and official.
[01:09:08.191 --> 01:09:11.032]  And Ron Paul's just up there with his arms crossed, laying out the facts.
[01:09:11.372 --> 01:09:11.512]  Yep.
[01:09:11.952 --> 01:09:13.513]  You know, it's not always popular.
[01:09:13.573 --> 01:09:17.374]  When you first start out on something, I was speaking out against the REAL ID Act.
[01:09:17.434 --> 01:09:20.635]  Originally, a lot of people thought the National ID Card was all right.
[01:09:21.135 --> 01:09:23.376]  But once people know the truth about it,
[01:09:23.772 --> 01:09:24.813]  They jump on board.
[01:09:40.606 --> 01:09:44.970]  Well, it certainly is, and they can call patriots and people that love the Constitution names all day.
[01:09:45.431 --> 01:09:49.575]  That isn't working anymore, and just when you called in, I checked you out real quick.
[01:09:49.655 --> 01:09:55.000]  I see that you're doing a lot of work and really helping lead the fight nationwide.
[01:09:55.020 --> 01:10:00.145]  We've got 30-plus states, what's the number now, that are saying they're going to try to block the REAL ID Act?
[01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:02.107]  And three or four that have voted to do it?
[01:10:02.147 --> 01:10:03.549]  What's the latest numbers?
[01:10:03.849 --> 01:10:11.655]  We've got about, I think it's 10 or 11, maybe 12 trying to keep up with actually passed legislation opposing implementation of the REAL ID Act.
[01:10:11.775 --> 01:10:19.241]  I've got 34 states who have active legislation and I've got 47 states who are committed to filing legislation.
[01:10:19.261 --> 01:10:23.225]  Some of them, you know, they're out of session or we missed the filing date for them.
[01:10:23.245 --> 01:10:28.409]  But this summer you're going to see a continuing ground swell as I go across the country talking about this.
[01:10:28.869 --> 01:10:32.312]  I think the American people are tired of the federal government pushing them around and
[01:10:32.921 --> 01:10:37.304]  They're standing up now and saying it's time we the people have a voice in this country.
[01:10:37.324 --> 01:10:40.106]  I think that kind of reflects what Ron Paul is saying.
[01:10:40.586 --> 01:10:43.909]  It's we the people speaking up here and you need to listen to us.
[01:10:44.649 --> 01:10:47.011]  We're talking to Missouri State Rep.
[01:10:47.071 --> 01:10:47.791]  Jim Guest.
[01:10:48.652 --> 01:10:57.278]  Jim, how do people get involved with the organization Fighting Real ID and tell folks about the legislators against it and how they visit that site?
[01:10:58.519 --> 01:11:02.801]  I've decided to form a coalition instead of two or three states trying to fight alone.
[01:11:02.821 --> 01:11:13.167]  We have a website called legislatorsagainstrealid.com and they can get on there and it shows them how to contact, but those states are actively opposing it.
[01:11:13.587 --> 01:11:26.915]  They can get in contact with me through that website or if they have trouble getting all this down I've also got my own website jimgast.com and that's how we're linking up all these organizations who are joining together to fight this.
[01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:29.788]  That's a good start there.
[01:11:30.108 --> 01:11:32.190]  Are you seeing an awakening happening?
[01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:33.250]  Because that's what I'm seeing.
[01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:34.931]  It's just accelerating.
[01:11:35.252 --> 01:11:38.113]  Are you seeing that in your area of Missouri?
[01:11:39.054 --> 01:11:40.035]  I'm seeing it in Missouri.
[01:11:40.075 --> 01:11:41.376]  I'm seeing it all across the country.
[01:11:41.416 --> 01:11:49.461]  I get calls from all over the country every day, especially when I issued my five points to Free America here a few days ago that I'm working on.
[01:11:50.421 --> 01:11:56.265]  Those five points include repealing the Real ID, repealing the Patriot Act,
[01:11:57.088 --> 01:12:00.471]  Repealing the North American Union that they're trying to push through for us.
[01:12:01.772 --> 01:12:06.396]  And working to, right now, this illegal immigration is a real problem.
[01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:11.680]  And we need to change our laws to give the states the legal authority to pick them up and deport them.
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.402]  Right now we don't have that.
[01:12:13.922 --> 01:12:15.323]  And we have to revise NAFTA.
[01:12:15.403 --> 01:12:19.507]  I think NAFTA has put such a huge drain on this country that we have to revise that.
[01:12:20.482 --> 01:12:35.126]  I get these five points after and most people identify with them and realize that our country is starting down the wrong road and we're at the crossroads right now and that's when we have to stop and say we need to get back on track and get back to what this constitution of this country was based upon.
[01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:36.286]  Absolutely.
[01:12:36.306 --> 01:12:37.926]  Well, Jim, you're an interesting fellow.
[01:12:37.946 --> 01:12:39.067]  I've seen your name before.
[01:12:39.087 --> 01:12:41.307]  I need to get you on as a guest sometime.
[01:12:41.347 --> 01:12:42.788]  I appreciate you coming on with us.
[01:12:43.088 --> 01:12:43.888]  I appreciate that.
[01:12:43.908 --> 01:12:45.048]  I've got to get back to Florida.
[01:12:45.068 --> 01:12:46.048]  We're in session right now.
[01:12:46.068 --> 01:12:46.308]  Thank you.
[01:12:46.328 --> 01:12:46.629]  Okay.
[01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:47.269]  Thank you, sir.
[01:12:49.267 --> 01:12:58.749]  I don't know what's going on, but I guess listeners now are scheduling guests, because they had him call in with the secretary on the back line, and then they put him on.
[01:12:59.029 --> 01:12:59.970]  But he's a good guy.
[01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:01.030]  I'm glad he's out there.
[01:13:02.230 --> 01:13:04.651]  The listeners are so out of control out there, but that's fine.
[01:13:05.531 --> 01:13:07.492]  Now guests just magically pop up on the show.
[01:13:08.272 --> 01:13:12.113]  But he is a good guy, and we appreciate him coming on the show.
[01:13:12.653 --> 01:13:14.813]  Jeremiah in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:13:14.873 --> 01:13:15.233]  Go ahead.
[01:13:17.944 --> 01:13:23.668]  Earlier this morning, um, on DeVue this morning, they had a huge debate talking about Ron Paul this morning.
[01:13:24.929 --> 01:13:25.670]  I didn't see that.
[01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:26.450]  What were they saying?
[01:13:27.831 --> 01:13:32.474]  Um, basically talking about, um, how Joy, um, agreed with his foreign policy.
[01:13:33.915 --> 01:13:41.361]  And, um, Hasselbeck was just flipping out because of... Well, I'll tell ya, Hasselbeck, literally, it's like she has a 70 IQ.
[01:13:41.481 --> 01:13:43.602]  I mean, she's a complete idiot.
[01:13:43.722 --> 01:13:44.863]  A complete birdbrain.
[01:13:45.544 --> 01:13:45.844]  I know.
[01:13:47.096 --> 01:14:01.859]  But there is basically this agreeing with Ron Paul, Rosie, Joy, and my guests on the show, but House Snack was just flipping out and I was just enjoying talking about Ron Paul on The View this morning.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:04.840]  I didn't know that happened.
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:08.221]  We'll have to get a tape of that and play a selection of it or I'm sure it'll be up on YouTube quickly.
[01:14:09.521 --> 01:14:13.482]  And I just started emailing The View saying, have Ron Paul come on the show.
[01:14:14.302 --> 01:14:16.743]  I'm just saying out to all the viewers, have Ron Paul
[01:14:20.492 --> 01:14:21.813]  I agree.
[01:14:21.933 --> 01:14:22.773]  Good to hear from you.
[01:14:24.054 --> 01:14:25.095]  Well, see, that's what they've done.
[01:14:25.115 --> 01:14:26.916]  Ron Paul is the winner of both the debates.
[01:14:26.976 --> 01:14:28.597]  He is the man everybody's talking about.
[01:14:28.917 --> 01:14:30.298]  He is the man that people support.
[01:14:30.558 --> 01:14:31.339]  And so what do they say?
[01:14:31.379 --> 01:14:32.779]  They say, ban him from the debates.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:34.500]  Ban him quickly.
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:35.381]  They are desperate.
[01:14:35.401 --> 01:14:37.402]  Believe me, they don't like coming out and saying, ban him.
[01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:42.225]  They thought they could demonize him and have ten guys up there and tell him, shut up and make fun of him.
[01:14:42.565 --> 01:14:46.227]  It blew up in their face like everything else you touch is going to turn to
[01:14:47.774 --> 01:14:49.635]  Rotten Rags, New World Order.
[01:14:49.835 --> 01:14:50.796]  Your time is up.
[01:14:51.977 --> 01:14:53.298]  Ernie, in New Jersey.
[01:14:53.338 --> 01:14:54.058]  You're on the air.
[01:14:54.098 --> 01:14:54.478]  Welcome.
[01:14:56.299 --> 01:14:56.600]  Hello.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:57.460]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:14:58.281 --> 01:14:59.001]  Good afternoon.
[01:14:59.341 --> 01:15:00.602]  A couple issues.
[01:15:00.682 --> 01:15:06.546]  First, Lou Dobbs is going to have... I can't think of his name now.
[01:15:06.586 --> 01:15:07.466]  I've been on the hold too long.
[01:15:07.486 --> 01:15:08.007]  Ron Paul.
[01:15:09.067 --> 01:15:12.690]  No, he's going to have the NAFTA guys pushing for the NAFTA freeze.
[01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:14.130]  He's going to have Robert Pastor.
[01:15:14.150 --> 01:15:14.811]  Pastor, yeah.
[01:15:15.256 --> 01:15:17.658]  That's... Lou Dobbs has been great over the years.
[01:15:17.738 --> 01:15:20.921]  More people should get on his website and check it out.
[01:15:20.981 --> 01:15:22.923]  No, it's one of the few good TV shows, yeah.
[01:15:23.383 --> 01:15:25.565]  And so, of course, it has top ratings on CNN, yeah.
[01:15:26.346 --> 01:15:29.169]  Yeah, I know he's getting a lot of heat from some places.
[01:15:29.209 --> 01:15:30.110]  I want to get rid of him, too.
[01:15:31.131 --> 01:15:33.313]  On the Democrat side, we do have a good Democrat.
[01:15:33.333 --> 01:15:35.855]  I think it's... He was on Lou Dobbs, Mike Rovell.
[01:15:36.878 --> 01:15:45.165]  He basically, I don't know if you watch the Democrat side, but he said the Democrats scared him and he was a military industrial complex.
[01:15:45.705 --> 01:15:48.388]  He definitely is for a Democrat by the best they have.
[01:15:49.469 --> 01:15:54.313]  And as far as Hillary, we want Hillary like we want Dick Cheney for president.
[01:15:54.333 --> 01:15:55.433]  She's a sideshow.
[01:15:56.795 --> 01:16:03.680]  Morris did a study, the first of debates, where he was lamenting Julianne.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:05.202]  We only gave him 1,800 words.
[01:16:07.031 --> 01:16:12.914]  One of them got 2,000 and the mean guy, Romney, got 22, so he was crippling.
[01:16:12.934 --> 01:16:13.775]  That's a big deal.
[01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:15.255]  The big deal is the truth.
[01:16:15.856 --> 01:16:19.238]  You can say a few words and do as much damage as somebody with 10,000 words.
[01:16:19.918 --> 01:16:20.578]  One last thing.
[01:16:20.598 --> 01:16:23.320]  Nehemiah was on the wall doing his business.
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:24.801]  I think you like him.
[01:16:25.401 --> 01:16:27.462]  Well, we all are, but especially you like Nehemiah.
[01:16:27.482 --> 01:16:30.264]  When you come down and start facing your enemies, you start swinging.
[01:16:30.284 --> 01:16:33.426]  A lot of times, innocent people are people who are dumbed down.
[01:16:34.625 --> 01:16:41.607]  I hear you and I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:16:41.687 --> 01:16:44.668]  It's just, you know, things are so far gone.
[01:16:44.688 --> 01:16:46.488]  I'm just telling it like it is.
[01:16:47.028 --> 01:16:48.509]  But I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:16:48.869 --> 01:16:49.669]  Ken in New York.
[01:16:49.689 --> 01:16:50.269]  You're on the air.
[01:16:50.329 --> 01:16:50.709]  Go ahead.
[01:16:50.729 --> 01:16:51.909]  Hi, Alex.
[01:16:52.670 --> 01:16:54.750]  I am calling about the amnesty issue.
[01:16:55.370 --> 01:17:00.191]  But before I get to that... Yeah, they were going to vote on total amnesty in the Senate this week.
[01:17:00.231 --> 01:17:02.152]  Now they're saying they're going to put it off to next week.
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:10.644]  And since I'll stick with that, I was going to comment on the neocons and the war, but I think... Well, comment on whatever you want.
[01:17:10.664 --> 01:17:11.244]  Just go ahead.
[01:17:11.664 --> 01:17:15.627]  Well, one of their idols is Woodrow Wilson.
[01:17:16.747 --> 01:17:28.774]  And just like Wilson, when he imprisoned people during World War I for publicly protesting America's involvement in that war, I think they're going to start to model their actions on what Wilson did back then.
[01:17:29.815 --> 01:17:31.356]  So, guys like you and
[01:17:32.512 --> 01:17:37.754]  People in public life who are basically opposing Iraq and the so-called war on terror.
[01:17:37.934 --> 01:17:41.575]  I think they're going to try and implement some kind of executive power.
[01:17:41.675 --> 01:17:42.235]  Are you kidding?
[01:17:42.255 --> 01:17:44.876]  That's all Michael Weiner's Savage talks about.
[01:17:44.936 --> 01:17:45.916]  That's all they push.
[01:17:45.936 --> 01:17:47.377]  That's what they constantly say.
[01:17:47.397 --> 01:17:48.697]  But I got news for them.
[01:17:49.077 --> 01:17:51.638]  I hope they try it because they're going to show everybody who they are.
[01:17:51.658 --> 01:17:52.558]  They're not going to get away with it.
[01:17:52.839 --> 01:17:53.019]  Right.
[01:17:53.039 --> 01:17:55.359]  That will be a groundswell of opposition to them, hopefully.
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:57.320]  Now the amnesty issue.
[01:17:57.967 --> 01:18:00.088]  I've been following very closely over the last few days.
[01:18:00.148 --> 01:18:03.230]  I participated in the whole Defeat to the Fire Rally last month.
[01:18:04.411 --> 01:18:13.057]  And what's really worrisome is that they're trying to do the same thing that when Frist, the Republican Majority Leader last year, tried to do.
[01:18:13.077 --> 01:18:16.159]  They're trying to do the same thing this year, right before Memorial Day weekend.
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.341]  They're trying to ramp through an amnesty bill in the Senate.
[01:18:19.681 --> 01:18:21.022]  The same M.O.
[01:18:22.003 --> 01:18:25.125]  And this year we have Harry Reid, the Democrat leader, is doing the same thing.
[01:18:26.558 --> 01:18:35.145]  And it is total, complete amnesty, and they've got Republican liars all over TV saying it will fix the problem and stop the illegals when it does the opposite.
[01:18:35.605 --> 01:18:37.146]  Congenital liars.
[01:18:37.227 --> 01:18:38.127]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:18:38.648 --> 01:18:51.617]  Oh, and one day they're going to vote on cloture on Senate Bill 1348, and that's the big thing, and I urge everyone listening to call their senators and tell them to vote against that.
[01:18:51.737 --> 01:18:52.218]  I hear you.
[01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:59.022]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.

[01:19:50.469 --> 01:19:52.190]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.

[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:19.221]  and erasing economic borders.
[01:20:19.421 --> 01:20:26.185]  Bush met with Vincent Fox, President of Mexico, Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, discussing a security and prosperity partnership.
[01:20:26.385 --> 01:20:29.927]  The formation of a North American Union will have a great impact on the U.S.
[01:20:29.987 --> 01:20:30.507]  economy.

[01:22:45.811 --> 01:22:46.312]  Call now!
[01:22:58.794 --> 01:23:13.866]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade
[01:23:16.494 --> 01:23:20.716]  Many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade.
[01:23:20.797 --> 01:23:25.999]  The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five.
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.521]  But I am still alive.
[01:23:29.541 --> 01:23:34.404]  I was a sailor.
[01:23:45.928 --> 01:23:52.171]  I sailed a schooner around the Horn of Mexico.
[01:23:52.231 --> 01:23:56.652]  I went aloft and furled a mace, a little blow.
[01:23:57.853 --> 01:24:01.715]  And when the yards broke off, they said that I got killed.
[01:24:03.335 --> 01:24:09.858]  But I'm living still.
[01:24:09.998 --> 01:24:14.580]  I was a dam builder, across a river deep and wide.
[01:24:21.807 --> 01:24:31.692]  I'll go back to your calls and I got several audio clips you haven't heard yet that we're going to be getting to the big huge man attack on Ron Paul.
[01:24:41.256 --> 01:24:44.338]  New article out by Paul Watson about Ron Paul.
[01:24:44.878 --> 01:24:53.044]  Neocon Republican Party hijackers, Neocon Republican Party hijackers seek to ban Ron Paul.
[01:24:53.804 --> 01:25:00.409]  Anti-American trash want to end the democratic process, kick Texas congressmen out of debates.
[01:25:01.049 --> 01:25:02.950]  Get this article, get it out to everybody.
[01:25:02.970 --> 01:25:04.071]  We need another headline.
[01:25:04.812 --> 01:25:05.192]  Stop
[01:25:06.679 --> 01:25:11.760]  The panicking establishment, or Republicans panic, seek to ban Ron Paul.
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:16.981]  Desperately try to save him from this right now, and save us from it.
[01:25:17.521 --> 01:25:21.642]  Because they're going to try to just claim that people want it, it's a democracy!
[01:25:22.282 --> 01:25:25.702]  We've got 10,000 neocon signatures here.
[01:25:26.262 --> 01:25:26.742]  Feel doubt?
[01:25:26.782 --> 01:25:29.083]  Look, Daffy Duck's on the list there, you see him?
[01:25:30.183 --> 01:25:35.684]  There is a way he's put up a petition, we're going to put links up to that on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[01:25:37.341 --> 01:25:41.085]  We're going to try to get somebody on from Ron Paul's office or the Congressman himself to respond to all this.
[01:25:41.565 --> 01:25:42.966]  They have a very small office.
[01:25:42.986 --> 01:25:44.408]  They are completely overwhelmed.
[01:25:45.789 --> 01:25:49.172]  The meager funds they did get in thanks to the listeners of the show predominantly.
[01:25:49.192 --> 01:25:51.134]  They've been trying to get the staff in they need.
[01:25:52.351 --> 01:25:52.892]  That's funny.
[01:25:53.312 --> 01:25:54.013]  And then the staff.
[01:25:55.254 --> 01:25:57.776]  I can't get through the staff we funded to get a hold of Ron Paul.
[01:25:57.816 --> 01:25:58.196]  It's funny.
[01:25:59.237 --> 01:26:00.598]  But it's classic.
[01:26:00.838 --> 01:26:02.059]  In a war, who expects that?
[01:26:02.119 --> 01:26:03.561]  I'm not here to get credit.
[01:26:03.581 --> 01:26:08.605]  I just want to be able to get the Congressman on again soon to respond to all this so his actual supporters can
[01:26:09.085 --> 01:26:13.227]  But hey, they know that nexus between Harlow Shrivers and Ron Paul is the Dynamo.
[01:26:13.628 --> 01:26:18.250]  That's why they attack and say, he goes on the evil Alex Jones Show.
[01:26:18.831 --> 01:26:20.051]  Oh, we must stop it!
[01:26:20.431 --> 01:26:22.072]  Tim in Ohio, then Chris and others.
[01:26:22.353 --> 01:26:23.233]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:26:23.273 --> 01:26:23.633]  Welcome.
[01:26:24.334 --> 01:26:25.094]  Alex, long time.
[01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:25.875]  Welcome.
[01:26:26.095 --> 01:26:27.636]  Tim from Truth, and I always said it.
[01:26:27.776 --> 01:26:31.238]  Teaching, researching, United States treasonous hierarchy.
[01:26:31.618 --> 01:26:32.238]  That's what we got.
[01:26:32.939 --> 01:26:37.221]  And I know I never take the time to stop and pat you on the back, but allow me this one time
[01:26:38.308 --> 01:26:40.610]  Bro, you're the best friend I've never met that I have.
[01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:41.531]  I just wanted you to know that.
[01:26:41.591 --> 01:26:42.952]  Well, I love all you as well.
[01:26:43.633 --> 01:26:47.876]  And whatever they do to you, there's going to be a thousand more to step in your place, so it doesn't matter.
[01:26:47.996 --> 01:26:50.258]  There's too many fire ants out of the nest.
[01:26:50.999 --> 01:27:01.108]  I was monitoring the networks yesterday prior to your broadcast of the mainstream media, and by media I mean manipulators eroding democracy in America.
[01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:09.907]  On MSNBC, you had Andrea Mitchell stating, no clear frontrunner, but still promoted the Big Three, of course, Romney, McCain, and Giuliani.
[01:27:10.527 --> 01:27:14.909]  Oh, that's the headline I was thinking Paul Watson ought to do, or Steve, or Slick Eisen, or Aaron.
[01:27:15.349 --> 01:27:18.211]  Ron Paul is the Republican frontrunner.
[01:27:18.671 --> 01:27:21.372]  Establishment panics to block him and ban him.
[01:27:21.812 --> 01:27:22.233]  That's it.
[01:27:22.313 --> 01:27:23.093]  He's the frontrunner.
[01:27:23.593 --> 01:27:25.094]  That's the message we've got to get out.
[01:27:25.334 --> 01:27:29.896]  Republicans seek to ban Republican frontrunner Ron Paul.
[01:27:30.096 --> 01:27:30.557]  Period.
[01:27:30.757 --> 01:27:31.157]  That's it.
[01:27:32.119 --> 01:27:33.760]  Go ahead, I'm calling Paul Watson with that headline.
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:34.320]  Go ahead, keep talking.
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:34.660]  That's okay.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.321]  Hey, Paul, how you doing?
[01:27:35.781 --> 01:27:40.764]  Over on Chicken Noodle News, you had John King call Ron Paul a straight-out libertarian.
[01:27:41.324 --> 01:27:46.747]  And on his package, over the audio, where they said lesser-known candidates, of course, they had a picture of Ron Paul.
[01:27:48.007 --> 01:27:58.233]  And on the Fox News Network, this is all in the hour leading up to your broadcast yesterday, they called Ron Paul a libertarian-slash-Republican and a second-tier
[01:27:59.213 --> 01:28:00.013]  That's right.
[01:28:00.053 --> 01:28:01.194]  He's the B team.
[01:28:01.234 --> 01:28:02.954]  He's not even legitimate.
[01:28:03.534 --> 01:28:05.735]  They're telling everyone, don't even consider him.
[01:28:06.155 --> 01:28:07.336]  Just forget him.
[01:28:08.216 --> 01:28:09.576]  That's rotten food.
[01:28:09.636 --> 01:28:10.316]  Don't buy it.
[01:28:10.376 --> 01:28:11.277]  It's perishable.
[01:28:11.717 --> 01:28:15.678]  It's out of its due date.
[01:28:16.438 --> 01:28:22.440]  Isn't it great that they're tipping their own hand because their own polls are showing that Ron Paul was ahead.
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:27.522]  No, that's the key point to attack and we're going to get it up on Prison Planet as soon as possible.
[01:28:29.242 --> 01:28:31.503]  Ron Paul is the Republican.
[01:28:32.163 --> 01:28:36.864]  Ron Paul emerges as clear Republican frontrunner in all major polls.
[01:28:37.584 --> 01:28:42.665]  Republican insiders panic, move to ban him from debates.
[01:28:44.125 --> 01:28:47.146]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.026 --> 01:28:50.727]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.304 --> 01:28:56.785]  Do you know that you can go solar for under 1200 bucks now?
[01:28:56.805 --> 01:28:58.446]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[01:28:58.626 --> 01:29:02.807]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:29:03.387 --> 01:29:08.269]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[01:29:08.789 --> 01:29:15.212]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[01:29:15.956 --> 01:29:18.658]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[01:29:18.818 --> 01:29:28.785]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[01:29:29.065 --> 01:29:32.748]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[01:29:32.828 --> 01:29:39.312]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[01:29:39.492 --> 01:29:40.533]  Are you ready to go solar?

[01:30:01.851 --> 01:30:02.432]  Concise?

[01:30:03.693 --> 01:30:06.655]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[01:30:06.976 --> 01:30:08.197]  War in Iran?
[01:30:08.717 --> 01:30:10.359]  A coming One World Church?
[01:30:11.099 --> 01:30:16.404]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[01:30:54.085 --> 01:30:56.507]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:30:57.168 --> 01:31:05.254]  Did you know that Senate committee investigations in the 1960s called the international communist movement the greatest conspiracy the world has ever witnessed?
[01:31:06.135 --> 01:31:13.381]  They said the communists had infiltrated into high government offices in the State Department and also advisors to presidents.
[01:31:14.312 --> 01:31:21.978]  Did you know that the Communist infiltration successfully stopped all FBI investigations into their secret activities?
[01:31:22.558 --> 01:31:31.264]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[01:31:31.284 --> 01:31:33.246]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[01:31:33.326 --> 01:31:33.726]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:31:41.632 --> 01:31:46.556]  516-8736 to request your subscription.
[01:31:47.156 --> 01:31:47.757]  Call now.
[01:31:47.897 --> 01:31:50.759]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:31:54.261 --> 01:32:03.188]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[01:32:09.271 --> 01:32:12.593]  The place is where you used to play.
[01:32:12.813 --> 01:32:18.515]  It was an inside joke, by the well-connected.
[01:32:18.635 --> 01:32:26.999]  You're a sinner frozen, so merrily rejected.
[01:32:27.259 --> 01:32:34.182]  It was an inside joke, like it always is.
[01:32:37.584 --> 01:32:54.850]  You really meant that, didn't you, Rose?
[01:32:54.930 --> 01:33:03.333]  While you were dreaming, this little island disappeared.
[01:33:09.226 --> 01:33:10.908]  We're good to go.
[01:33:38.539 --> 01:33:42.141]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:42.301 --> 01:33:44.382]  Until we all wake up...
[01:34:01.812 --> 01:34:02.072]  That's right.
[01:34:02.132 --> 01:34:03.693]  They're going to keep carrying out those terror attacks.
[01:34:03.713 --> 01:34:08.994]  They're going to keep doing it and doing it and doing it until we all wake up, wake up, wake up.
[01:34:12.315 --> 01:34:15.136]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones back here live.
[01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:16.477]  I want to go through more of your calls.
[01:34:16.517 --> 01:34:18.217]  We've got two audio clips I want to play.
[01:34:19.958 --> 01:34:22.219]  And just continue with analysis throughout the broadcast.
[01:34:22.259 --> 01:34:26.160]  We are now in the crossroads of history.
[01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:29.081]  Six months from now, a year from now, things will be totally different.
[01:34:30.015 --> 01:34:32.097]  We now are in control of our own destiny.
[01:34:32.197 --> 01:34:36.500]  Will we force Ron Paul through to be the frontrunner?
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:37.661]  He is the frontrunner.
[01:34:37.942 --> 01:34:40.764]  They're trying to say now he's nobody, he's nothing, he's a loser.
[01:34:41.064 --> 01:34:41.905]  He shouldn't be in there.
[01:34:41.965 --> 01:34:43.967]  Ban him because he's winning all the polls.
[01:34:44.587 --> 01:34:45.288]  You see them.
[01:34:45.608 --> 01:34:49.531]  You've got a boxer that won't take a dive, a boxer that won't play games.
[01:34:49.751 --> 01:34:56.537]  You've got a horse that the mob doesn't own that is literally, you know, we're talking a whole
[01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:07.777]  A whole track ahead of them, and literally Al Capone standing up with his deer rifle, shooting at the horse right now, so that it'll lose.
[01:35:09.078 --> 01:35:11.599]  And callin' that freedom, and callin' that not cheating.
[01:35:11.979 --> 01:35:12.879]  I mean, it's so obvious.
[01:35:12.919 --> 01:35:19.061]  It'd be like somebody, let's say the mob owns eight horses, and the ninth horse they don't own, and it's winning, and they didn't bet on it.
[01:35:19.802 --> 01:35:25.584]  And if the mob just stood up, the mob boss stood up with a deer rifle, or a shotgun, and started shooting at the horse.
[01:35:26.464 --> 01:35:28.105]  I mean, how obvious does it have to get?
[01:35:29.562 --> 01:35:31.763]  They're a pack of lying, dirty cheaters!
[01:35:33.563 --> 01:35:40.264]  And you're seeing the will of the people, a constitutional candidate who they're attempting to smear and block right now.
[01:35:40.424 --> 01:35:41.685]  I think it's going to blow up in their face.
[01:35:42.005 --> 01:35:47.106]  But it may blow up in their face and make Ron Paul a folk hero, and then they'll just move right on and still ban him.
[01:35:52.027 --> 01:35:54.168]  And frankly, he's been restrained in the debates.
[01:35:54.228 --> 01:35:55.688]  Imagine if he would have really said what he thought.
[01:35:57.583 --> 01:35:59.345]  Let's go quickly through some of your calls now.
[01:35:59.726 --> 01:36:00.327]  Who's up next?
[01:36:00.347 --> 01:36:01.048]  Chris in Florida?
[01:36:01.689 --> 01:36:02.289]  Chris, go ahead.
[01:36:02.309 --> 01:36:02.850]  You're on the air.
[01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:05.634]  This is Chris Steiner in Tampa.
[01:36:06.414 --> 01:36:12.758]  I wanted to ask you first, what was the picture that Popular Mechanics used for Building 7?
[01:36:13.779 --> 01:36:17.161]  I heard you say that it was a doctor picture or a picture of another building.
[01:36:17.181 --> 01:36:18.442]  Do you know where they got that?
[01:36:18.562 --> 01:36:26.288]  Yes, well they just used a photo that showed one of the other nearby buildings at an angle and said that that was Building 7.
[01:36:26.748 --> 01:36:29.530]  Steve Watson did a big report on that, you can go find it.
[01:36:30.607 --> 01:36:31.567]  Okay.
[01:36:31.927 --> 01:36:37.769]  And I would like to know, if Troy is listening, maybe he can answer next time he calls in.
[01:36:38.329 --> 01:36:40.769]  Troy from West Virginia, if that is his real name.
[01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:46.450]  Well, number one, why does he use different names to call in the various shows on GCN?
[01:36:47.091 --> 01:36:49.751]  And also, what do you stand for, Troy?
[01:36:50.391 --> 01:36:52.812]  For what cause do you stand?
[01:36:52.952 --> 01:36:57.473]  And what's made you study to become an activist, and in what area?
[01:36:57.713 --> 01:36:58.213]  What kind of
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:08.984]  His cause has really struck close to home or gotten you emotional, other than trying to discredit people who dissent or trying to attack.
[01:37:09.004 --> 01:37:13.265]  You know, he doesn't stand for anything except for finding fault with people who dissent.
[01:37:15.006 --> 01:37:17.086]  Look, the guy probably works at CENTCOM.
[01:37:17.267 --> 01:37:18.047]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:37:18.087 --> 01:37:19.167]  He fits the bill.
[01:37:19.887 --> 01:37:26.990]  Yeah, I would say that's true, the type of argument... Or if not, CENTCOM propaganda made him who he is.
[01:37:29.159 --> 01:37:30.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:31.261 --> 01:37:40.891]  And I want to thank you for letting me put out a supposedly anti-Rosie website that some of your listeners obviously got onto right after I announced it.
[01:37:41.451 --> 01:37:43.673]  It was called rosieofthedumbass.com.
[01:37:44.114 --> 01:37:52.102]  And thanks to them getting on there, we've had a lot more people reading the threads that are pro-Rosie now that
[01:37:53.274 --> 01:38:08.933]  Now that people have gotten on there, you can see that the views for the I Hate Rosie thread are less than a third of the views for the Rosie 9-1-1 series, and the I Hate Rosie thread got a huge head start.
[01:38:09.798 --> 01:38:17.243]  So I just wanted to thank your listeners for getting on there and helping explain some things, and some of the CENTCOM propagandists are on there as well.
[01:38:17.283 --> 01:38:20.285]  You can tell some of the same arguments that Detroit tries to pull.
[01:38:20.565 --> 01:38:26.249]  By the way, for listeners that just joined us, CENTCOM admits they're on the web propagandizing illegally inside the U.S.
[01:38:26.289 --> 01:38:27.830]  I appreciate your call, Chris.
[01:38:28.771 --> 01:38:35.015]  I didn't mention this, but yeah, Rosie did put on the website yesterday, on her blog, that she has my videos.
[01:38:36.016 --> 01:38:36.896]  Now, we already knew that.
[01:38:37.057 --> 01:38:38.958]  She woke up watching Terror Storm,
[01:38:39.768 --> 01:38:40.649]  Last September.
[01:38:40.909 --> 01:38:42.051]  She'd already had suspicions.
[01:38:42.812 --> 01:38:45.474]  And then now she's seen a lot of the films and has really done her research.
[01:38:46.656 --> 01:38:49.018]  And again, I don't agree with Rosie O'Donnell on every issue.
[01:38:49.579 --> 01:38:52.122]  But she's got guts, and as they say, guts is enough.
[01:38:53.183 --> 01:38:55.265]  And she is being attacked.
[01:38:55.746 --> 01:38:57.307]  Just like Ron Paul is being attacked.
[01:38:57.347 --> 01:38:59.370]  It's about destroying free speech.
[01:39:01.152 --> 01:39:11.381]  Whether it's an anti-war demonstrator standing up in front of a recruiting office on a city sidewalk in an Abu Ghraib outfit and they come up and beat him up and the cops take him to jail for them beating him up.
[01:39:12.562 --> 01:39:15.685]  Photos and video were shot and it's just, yeah, that's New America.
[01:39:15.965 --> 01:39:19.288]  The troops come out and beat you up and the cops take you to jail.
[01:39:23.374 --> 01:39:25.255]  Or you're a pro-lifer demonstrating.
[01:39:25.295 --> 01:39:27.475]  You're still 100 feet away from the abortuary.
[01:39:27.875 --> 01:39:28.355]  They don't care.
[01:39:28.375 --> 01:39:29.956]  They come over and beat the daylights out of you.
[01:39:29.996 --> 01:39:31.616]  Liberals all hiss and scream with pleasure.
[01:39:32.596 --> 01:39:32.976]  You see?
[01:39:32.996 --> 01:39:38.318]  Or whether you see this attempt to ban Ron Paul.
[01:39:38.358 --> 01:39:39.818]  You see this attempt to fire Rosie.
[01:39:40.218 --> 01:39:42.079]  We all hang together or we hang separate.
[01:39:42.319 --> 01:39:52.181]  Either we agree there's a First Amendment and we support the pastors at the outfest who were protesting and got arrested and charged with 47 years in prison apiece for praying on a sidewalk.
[01:39:52.944 --> 01:40:02.349]  That went to trial and a higher up court had to strike it down and the judge was reprimanded, but that was the federal government and the ADL in 2004 and the Bush U.S.
[01:40:02.389 --> 01:40:04.050]  Attorney doing all that.
[01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:05.791]  I mean, they're not playing games.
[01:40:06.711 --> 01:40:08.372]  They're going to take everybody's free speech.
[01:40:09.893 --> 01:40:14.976]  You know, I disagree with the Ku Klux Klan and the mindless things they say at their rallies.
[01:40:15.982 --> 01:40:20.504]  And frankly, usually it's feds, and that's even been in major news now, Orlando Sentinel and other papers.
[01:40:20.724 --> 01:40:21.325]  We already knew that.
[01:40:21.365 --> 01:40:25.907]  It's been caught a thousand times, literally, but it's been back in the news big time.
[01:40:26.247 --> 01:40:32.790]  But even though they're fat, disgusting, evil, and by fat I mean their souls, you know, big, when I say fat, I'm a little fat myself.
[01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:44.996]  I mean, you know the connotation, just like, they're just these, their souls are lecherous and anemic and slovenly.
[01:40:46.161 --> 01:40:46.942]  Slothful!
[01:40:48.803 --> 01:40:58.450]  And they're out there, and I hate what the Feds are saying as they lead the Nazi and Klan rallies, but the, you know, really the Feds don't have a right to stage and do that, but even, they claim it's free speech, so let them.
[01:41:00.471 --> 01:41:05.375]  It's like, I don't like the little Reconquistas running around saying, death to America, we're taking over Oslo.
[01:41:05.715 --> 01:41:08.177]  If they're a citizen, they got a right to spout that stuff.
[01:41:09.038 --> 01:41:13.241]  Now, if they're in the government, and they've sworn an oath, and they start violating the Bill of Rights, it's treason.
[01:41:13.961 --> 01:41:15.002]  See, there's the difference.
[01:41:15.896 --> 01:41:17.818]  There's the difference right there.
[01:41:17.899 --> 01:41:18.740]  You're in the military.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:19.320]  It's treason.
[01:41:20.201 --> 01:41:22.083]  And that's a completely different subject.
[01:41:22.884 --> 01:41:25.508]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls here.
[01:41:26.569 --> 01:41:27.470]  Who is up next?
[01:41:27.610 --> 01:41:28.471]  Richard in Texas.
[01:41:28.491 --> 01:41:29.112]  Go ahead, Richard.
[01:41:30.501 --> 01:41:35.042]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to add a little bit more about what went on with The View this morning.
[01:41:36.142 --> 01:41:41.224]  Barbara Wawa was not there, and Rosie actually stayed fairly quiet through all this.
[01:41:41.304 --> 01:41:49.766]  I don't know the red-headed lady's name, but she was the one that brought up the Ron Paul in the debate thing, and she was very good.
[01:41:50.086 --> 01:41:55.767]  She made Elizabeth Hasselbeck, who was arguing back, that ditzy blonde neocon, look like an absolute idiot.
[01:41:56.427 --> 01:42:07.877]  And she was commenting about, you know, how our policy and what Ron Paul had said, how our policies are causing these blowback things and hatred in the Islamic community in the Middle East.
[01:42:08.777 --> 01:42:12.461]  You know, she said that really what we needed was policy review.
[01:42:12.781 --> 01:42:16.464]  She was getting great support and applause from the audience.
[01:42:17.104 --> 01:42:33.513]  And, you know, she talked about the military bases that we've got all over the world, the ones that are in Saudi Arabia, the construction of 14 bases in Iraq, the fact that we've killed 650,000 Iraqis, she mentioned, and what if that same sort of thing was going on here?
[01:42:34.193 --> 01:42:35.834]  And she was just very good.
[01:42:35.854 --> 01:42:42.658]  This thing lasted for about 10 minutes, and Ron Paul was the focus of that entire session.
[01:42:44.321 --> 01:42:52.147]  Well, number one, war is 70 to 80 percent, depending on the poll, it's all in that bracket, negative.
[01:42:52.668 --> 01:42:57.371]  So Ron Paul was right when he said this is the popular thing for Republicans to win.
[01:42:57.852 --> 01:42:59.853]  The Republicans are supposed to lose.
[01:43:01.034 --> 01:43:07.920]  Just like Bush Senior, just like 1996 when they ran that corpse Bob Dole against
[01:43:09.565 --> 01:43:10.005]  Clinton.
[01:43:10.446 --> 01:43:19.092]  This is just a baton handing ceremony, and Ron Paul is threatening to mess up the party, and little Princess Hillary getting coronated.
[01:43:19.513 --> 01:43:24.757]  And so the neocons are absolutely having convulsions right now.
[01:43:25.447 --> 01:43:37.017]  Do you think there's a possibility that getting tossed out of the Republican running is possibly a benefit to Ron Paul, and that it would really catch people's attention, and he could rise up even further?
[01:43:37.037 --> 01:43:38.398]  Well, he's a man of his word.
[01:43:38.438 --> 01:43:39.439]  He's a man of his word.
[01:43:39.999 --> 01:43:43.962]  But he knows that if he was to say that he would do a third party, they'd say, oh good, then get out of the party.
[01:43:44.363 --> 01:43:45.704]  That would be seen as disloyal.
[01:43:47.308 --> 01:43:54.729]  So, I don't know what his true intention is, but I tend to believe him that he, you know, if it works in the Republican Party, he'll do it.
[01:43:54.769 --> 01:43:55.849]  If not, he's going to get out of it.
[01:43:56.330 --> 01:44:03.651]  But they're going to try to kick him out right now, defrock him, you know, tar and feather him for not being a larcenous New World Order killer of the country.
[01:44:03.991 --> 01:44:05.171]  I mean, I mean that when I say it.
[01:44:05.191 --> 01:44:07.732]  Another opportunity for a big backfire in their faces.
[01:44:08.512 --> 01:44:09.052]  Absolutely.
[01:44:09.092 --> 01:44:10.092]  Good to hear from you, Richard.
[01:44:10.472 --> 01:44:12.432]  Jason in San Fran, you're on the air.
[01:44:12.452 --> 01:44:15.773]  Hi, this guy, Saul Nunes?
[01:44:17.797 --> 01:44:20.566]  I believe he's the chairman of the Republican Party up there in Michigan.
[01:44:20.706 --> 01:44:21.067]  Yes.
[01:44:21.107 --> 01:44:23.134]  He's the guy that's, he's in charge of circulating this.
[01:44:24.164 --> 01:44:28.486]  This petition, I have his number here, and I know on a lot of message boards a lot of people are giving these people a call.
[01:44:28.586 --> 01:44:31.187]  Yeah, so is the head of GOPAC.
[01:44:31.547 --> 01:44:36.669]  We need to call the head of GOPAC, Mr. Steele, who's a steel ice pick in America's throat.
[01:44:37.409 --> 01:44:41.011]  We want to call all these people and let them know we're fully aware of their treacherous activities.
[01:44:41.331 --> 01:44:45.873]  Sure, you want to give the Republican Party chairman a call in the state of Michigan?
[01:44:45.893 --> 01:44:46.213]  Go ahead.
[01:44:46.473 --> 01:44:47.974]  He's actually in North Carolina right now.
[01:44:47.994 --> 01:44:48.754]  Would you try to get him on?
[01:44:48.774 --> 01:44:50.054]  It's 517-487-5413.
[01:44:55.925 --> 01:44:58.526]  517 area code 4875413.
[01:44:59.166 --> 01:45:16.130]  I think it's more important to call the RNC National and let those traders know that we're fully aware they're bought and paid for by foreign interest, to let them know that this is all just a baton handoff to Hillary, and tell them we're not going to... tell them that... I mean, even National Review said this.
[01:45:16.731 --> 01:45:21.732]  If the Republicans don't get anti-war and anti-New World Order, the party may actually break up.
[01:45:22.407 --> 01:45:24.087]  And we've seen parties die before.
[01:45:24.407 --> 01:45:26.248]  And that's probably what these guys actually want.
[01:45:26.488 --> 01:45:36.230]  These pundits and political strategists and GOPAC heads, they'll just go join the new, you know, British slash Israeli party or whatever it is.
[01:45:37.190 --> 01:45:43.271]  Yeah, there's got to be an absolute onslaught, I think, on the part of the people that are just on the messaging boards on the internet.
[01:45:43.291 --> 01:45:46.232]  Yeah, give the scumbag a phone number again.
[01:45:46.252 --> 01:45:48.092]  That's 517, is the area code 487?
[01:45:52.643 --> 01:45:53.664]  I appreciate that.
[01:45:53.725 --> 01:45:54.526]  Absolutely, folks.
[01:45:54.546 --> 01:45:55.547]  You heard the phone number.
[01:45:55.567 --> 01:45:56.348]  Give the traitors a call.
[01:46:09.446 --> 01:46:11.227]  And they are.
[01:46:11.367 --> 01:46:12.848]  He is the front-runner.
[01:46:13.168 --> 01:46:14.329]  He is the leader of the PAC.
[01:46:14.389 --> 01:46:16.450]  He is the front-runner Republican.
[01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:17.271]  They know it.
[01:46:17.651 --> 01:46:18.852]  He's a real conservative.
[01:46:19.252 --> 01:46:27.778]  They're not, and they're trying to kick him out of the debate and block the electoral process, block the Democratic process, block our candidate.
[01:46:28.678 --> 01:46:31.320]  And it is an affront to America.
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:35.302]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Illinois.
[01:46:35.342 --> 01:46:36.303]  You're on the air, Mike.
[01:46:37.043 --> 01:46:37.504]  Hi, Alex.
[01:46:38.379 --> 01:46:40.501]  Enjoy your show and everything you're doing for the cause.
[01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:55.916]  I was thinking about an idea that maybe there's a way to start a reward fund for the criminals that did the 911 and you could tie it to Ron Paul's donations and like say half of it goes to Ron Paul and half goes to reward for the criminals of 911.
[01:46:57.586 --> 01:47:00.689]  Yeah, I really don't want to do official things in the name of the campaign.
[01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:02.651]  Then it gets into campaign finance laws.
[01:47:03.072 --> 01:47:04.914]  See, have you ever read the federal or even state laws?
[01:47:05.374 --> 01:47:07.637]  It's basically impossible to even follow the law.
[01:47:08.077 --> 01:47:09.198]  You've just got to attempt to.
[01:47:09.218 --> 01:47:12.402]  And so that's why I'm staying out of actual campaigning and things.
[01:47:12.442 --> 01:47:15.145]  I've said folks should support him and donate, and I certainly have.
[01:47:15.945 --> 01:47:19.950]  And if Ron Paul could just stay away from all the party hacks,
[01:47:20.490 --> 01:47:20.971]  I think so.
[01:47:40.533 --> 01:47:48.056]  Yeah, well, I was just thinking that, you know, obviously you put enough money out there, there's got to be millions that are aware of it, and they throw in a dollar.
[01:47:48.316 --> 01:47:49.957]  Yeah, I just don't have a lot of money.
[01:47:50.177 --> 01:47:55.019]  So, certainly not these days with all the money I've been spending on expanding.
[01:47:55.679 --> 01:48:00.601]  But, yeah, yeah, I just don't have the manpower, the energy to start a reward fund.
[01:48:00.861 --> 01:48:02.002]  But maybe somebody should do it.
[01:48:02.082 --> 01:48:02.842]  Maybe you should do it.
[01:48:03.082 --> 01:48:05.563]  Yeah, well, I would, except I'm partially blind.
[01:48:05.603 --> 01:48:07.944]  I have a problem even seeing what I'm doing.
[01:48:09.268 --> 01:48:12.269]  Well, you're having an effect calling in talk radio, talking to millions of people.
[01:48:12.850 --> 01:48:17.852]  And hey, we've got it going up on Prison Planet in a minute, and Infowars.com as well as Jones Report.
[01:48:17.872 --> 01:48:19.253]  I know it's up on Jones Report.
[01:48:19.713 --> 01:48:22.234]  I just saw Aaron in there 20 minutes ago signing the petition.
[01:48:22.614 --> 01:48:26.896]  Go in there and sign one to be sent to the RNC not to ban Ron Paul.
[01:48:27.576 --> 01:48:28.317]  Yep, I'll do that.
[01:48:29.237 --> 01:48:29.757]  Thanks so much.
[01:48:29.857 --> 01:48:30.478]  Alright, thank you.
[01:48:30.518 --> 01:48:31.418]  I appreciate your call.
[01:48:33.433 --> 01:48:40.639]  Yeah, for those who don't know, the head of the biggest Republican PAC, or GOPAC, Mr. Steele, is calling for him to be removed from the debates.
[01:48:42.101 --> 01:48:44.623]  Fox News has called for him to be removed from the debates.
[01:48:44.883 --> 01:48:51.429]  They have called for him to be removed by the state chairman of the Republican Party in Michigan.
[01:48:51.789 --> 01:48:53.070]  A few other states are doing that.
[01:48:55.612 --> 01:49:03.456]  Grand theft of the people's will and the process of election in our republic, in our constitutional republic.
[01:49:04.136 --> 01:49:24.405]  He is the clear frontrunner and out in front of everyone, you see this degenerate, disgusting, open border promoting, assault weapon ban loving, tax and spend, foreign adventure, devalue the dollar, just absolute enemies of this country.
[01:49:25.296 --> 01:49:38.585]  Who hijack the party and use it as their personal war house, use it as their personal latrine, use it as their personal doormat, use it as their personal toilet paper and Kleenex and birdcage liner.
[01:49:39.146 --> 01:49:45.610]  You are a pack of parasites that have infested the Republican Party.
[01:49:45.850 --> 01:49:46.471]  Get out!
[01:49:46.851 --> 01:49:52.675]  Get out of the way, you little beady-eyed, perfumed pomps!
[01:49:56.977 --> 01:50:02.463]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.824 --> 01:50:10.452]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.167 --> 01:50:18.211]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.611 --> 01:50:30.037]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.357 --> 01:50:33.839]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.319 --> 01:50:36.260]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:40.422]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.746 --> 01:50:54.507]  Terrorism!
[01:50:54.667 --> 01:50:55.407]  Terrorism!
[01:50:55.528 --> 01:51:01.572]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:51:01.853 --> 01:51:03.434]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:51:03.674 --> 01:51:06.156]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:51:06.556 --> 01:51:21.128]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:51:21.148 --> 01:51:21.488]  government.
[01:51:21.649 --> 01:51:23.370]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:29.734]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:51:29.874 --> 01:51:34.357]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[01:51:53.385 --> 01:51:55.106]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.326 --> 01:51:59.029]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.349 --> 01:52:01.570]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:52:02.071 --> 01:52:08.295]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.435 --> 01:52:13.358]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.558 --> 01:52:22.504]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[01:52:22.884 --> 01:52:28.887]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.
[01:52:29.147 --> 01:52:32.228]  Turn your internet on and off with one simple switch.

[01:53:01.798 --> 01:53:02.879]  Put it in high gear.
[01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:07.722]  Press the pedal all the way down to the floorboard.
[01:53:07.742 --> 01:53:10.143]  So you feel it grind on the metal.
[01:53:13.005 --> 01:53:14.185]  And just pick a target.
[01:53:15.966 --> 01:53:18.688]  These people are not invincible.
[01:53:20.949 --> 01:53:21.990]  They will be defeated.
[01:53:24.148 --> 01:53:33.556]  The more they squeeze, the more they push, the more people they abuse, the bigger the army of liberty grows.
[01:53:34.297 --> 01:53:50.210]  Why do you think Thomas Jefferson said the tree of liberty is watered by the blood of patriots and tyrants?
[01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:51.051]  Welcome back!
[01:53:53.042 --> 01:53:53.942]  All right.
[01:53:56.884 --> 01:53:58.124]  There is so much going on.
[01:53:59.885 --> 01:54:04.066]  This wasn't supposed to leak out, but it has leaked out.
[01:54:06.907 --> 01:54:10.789]  And I'm going to have to call Paul Watson and get a press release out on this.
[01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:14.710]  We're going to have a major press release out by the end of the show today.
[01:54:14.730 --> 01:54:15.891]  Poor Paul has to do everything.
[01:54:20.484 --> 01:54:21.964]  I've been keeping quiet about this.
[01:54:21.984 --> 01:54:30.627]  It was really pretty much my decision and the guy's decision to keep it quiet to hopefully it would go ahead and come to fruition.
[01:54:31.447 --> 01:54:33.107]  But no sense in that now.
[01:54:33.127 --> 01:54:35.188]  Might as well let you all know about it.
[01:54:35.228 --> 01:54:38.929]  So it'll be a big announcement coming up in about 30 minutes today.
[01:54:40.049 --> 01:54:42.610]  So if you want to hear that, just stay tuned.
[01:54:45.041 --> 01:54:49.244]  Let me just take this time out, because I'm going to start the next hour and I'm going to play audio clips, and I'm going to go back to calls.
[01:54:49.284 --> 01:54:50.404]  I've canceled all the guests today.
[01:54:51.285 --> 01:54:54.146]  Because I haven't even played this yet.
[01:54:54.206 --> 01:54:57.748]  You'd think if I'm being attacked on Fox News I'd get to that first, but I haven't.
[01:54:59.729 --> 01:55:03.992]  Yet another Fox News smear job on Ron Paul, Alex Jones, and 9-11 Truth.
[01:55:04.672 --> 01:55:07.934]  Michelle Malkin says, because Ron Paul comes on my show, he should be banned from the debates.
[01:55:07.954 --> 01:55:13.077]  Now the Republican Party chairman in Michigan and several other states are calling for it.
[01:55:13.812 --> 01:55:15.513]  Fox News has been calling for it.
[01:55:15.593 --> 01:55:21.535]  The head of the Republican Party's biggest political action committee, GOPAC, Mr. Steele, has called for it.
[01:55:21.575 --> 01:55:22.315]  We've played that.
[01:55:22.856 --> 01:55:23.876]  That was the night of the debate.
[01:55:23.936 --> 01:55:26.017]  He's actively out there pulling strings now.
[01:55:28.198 --> 01:55:28.998]  Yeah, it's clear.
[01:55:29.318 --> 01:55:32.179]  As he said, we don't want a real Republican to actually be in here.
[01:55:32.219 --> 01:55:34.020]  We want people that'll lose to Hillary.
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:36.501]  That's the Fox News Pentagon Operation Plan.
[01:55:38.966 --> 01:55:52.015]  Before I end this hour here, listen, if you believe in what we're doing, go to InfoWars.com and look at all the books and videos we carry by some of the best documentary filmmakers and authors out there, but also the 15 films I've made, the book I wrote.
[01:55:52.976 --> 01:55:57.259]  Paul Watson's book is now out of print, but you can read it at PrisonPlanet.tv if you're a member, by the way.
[01:55:57.279 --> 01:55:59.020]  A lot of books up there.
[01:56:00.301 --> 01:56:03.063]  And go to InfoWars.com and get TerrorStorm.
[01:56:03.815 --> 01:56:07.696]  The first edition, there is, I don't know, like 700 or something left of it.
[01:56:08.136 --> 01:56:11.117]  When it's gone, Terror Storm is sold out and there will be no more.
[01:56:11.798 --> 01:56:19.060]  And I'm sending a signed card with each Terror Storm, any orders that came in this week, until they sell out.
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:21.821]  We'll have second edition coming out in late July.
[01:56:22.761 --> 01:56:26.062]  But it looks like they probably will sell out before we even get any more videos in.
[01:56:26.603 --> 01:56:30.704]  So if you want a Terror Storm and don't want to wait and want to have the collector's item first edition from us,
[01:56:31.589 --> 01:56:34.194]  This is not the edition put out by the national distributor.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.085]  No, this is the one that I put out.
[01:56:39.185 --> 01:56:41.791]  And they're not going to offer the first edition anymore, by the way.

[01:57:38.509 --> 01:57:38.969]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.989 --> 01:57:39.890]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:40.111 --> 01:57:42.733]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:42.793 --> 01:57:46.797]  You want answers?
[01:57:46.917 --> 01:57:48.759]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.092 --> 01:58:01.756]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.277 --> 01:58:06.381]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.061 --> 01:58:09.484]  Folks, you know stuff is desperate.
[01:58:10.044 --> 01:58:16.071]  You have Aaron Russo, who for four and a half years has been battling cancer, hasn't had an interview in several months.
[01:58:17.674 --> 01:58:25.760]  is calling into the show because he got word about the petition by the RNC to shoot down Ron Paul to remove him from the debates.
[01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:29.883]  We're putting up our own petition right now with the big main petition site.
[01:58:29.903 --> 01:58:34.666]  We're going to have a link to the other one but we know we can trust ourselves so we do trust the lady that's doing it.
[01:58:34.686 --> 01:58:35.227]  We don't know her.
[01:58:35.247 --> 01:58:44.393]  We're going to have our own petition written of why it's for free speech and he is the frontrunner and they're trying to cheat him and tell the RNC to stop hijacking the Republican Party
[01:58:44.833 --> 01:58:47.796]  That is going up on PrisonPlanet.com very, very soon.
[01:58:47.816 --> 01:58:50.859]  We will have that up there for you.
[01:58:50.879 --> 01:58:53.381]  Aaron is writing it and filing the petition right now.
[01:58:53.821 --> 01:58:59.386]  We have a link to another petition up on the site as well, right now at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:59.707 --> 01:59:01.288]  But Aaron Russo popping in.
[01:59:01.308 --> 01:59:04.070]  Aaron, it's great to have you on, my friend.
[01:59:04.090 --> 01:59:04.831]  We've been praying for you.
[01:59:05.272 --> 01:59:05.812]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:59:05.832 --> 01:59:07.494]  I appreciate that very, very much.
[01:59:07.574 --> 01:59:08.635]  I'm calling in because
[01:59:09.787 --> 01:59:14.412]  I feel like we're coming down to the final throes of what's happening in this country.
[01:59:14.452 --> 01:59:23.941]  They're making their big move right now to close off everything, you know, and to make sure that we become serious slaves to these people.
[01:59:24.682 --> 01:59:32.069]  And their next move is to definitely get Ron Paul out of these debates, because now he has an opportunity.
[01:59:32.856 --> 01:59:36.581]  To speak up to the American public, in front of the American public, this morning.
[01:59:36.721 --> 01:59:41.187]  And they know he's going to end up being a frontrunner when there's only three or four guys up there and then it's over.
[01:59:41.207 --> 01:59:41.908]  That's right.
[01:59:41.968 --> 01:59:46.975]  And this morning, I don't know if you saw this or not, but even on that ABC television show, The View,
[01:59:48.056 --> 01:59:52.980]  Uh, Joyce Behar and, uh, Rosie were pushing Ron, uh, were discussing what Ron did.
[01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:54.441]  No, it's gone viral.
[01:59:54.601 --> 01:59:59.224]  They're panicking right now and saying he's a B-tier, he's not a real candidate.
[01:59:59.764 --> 02:00:00.785]  He needs to be removed.
[02:00:00.845 --> 02:00:03.567]  But he's got great press on The View this morning, Ron did.
[02:00:03.587 --> 02:00:07.890]  In other words, Joyce Behar was saying, I loved what the guy said.
[02:00:08.471 --> 02:00:08.991]  He was right.
[02:00:09.071 --> 02:00:12.373]  They had another point of view about why this happened on 9-11.
[02:00:13.034 --> 02:00:17.437]  And that, uh, you know, we cause a lot of our own problems with our policies over in the Middle East.
[02:00:18.127 --> 02:00:19.429]  And that Ron Paul was correct.
[02:00:19.490 --> 02:00:21.513]  And this was on national television this morning.
[02:00:22.314 --> 02:00:25.600]  And she got a big hand for supporting Ron Paul.
[02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:27.363]  Yes, Aaron, I totally agree with you.
[02:00:27.403 --> 02:00:28.585]  The point I'm making here...
[02:00:31.727 --> 02:00:35.989]  Well, I can't say for certain he's a frontrunner, but what I can say is that he's in the pack
[02:00:59.378 --> 02:01:02.602]  Where the world can hear what he has to say and hear another point of view.
[02:01:02.622 --> 02:01:03.202]  I don't know.
[02:01:03.262 --> 02:01:05.164]  I mean, he's the only one that can beat Hillary.
[02:01:05.365 --> 02:01:07.066]  He's the only one Democrats will vote for.
[02:01:07.086 --> 02:01:18.779]  Rather than trying to handicap something that we know who can beat who and so on and so forth, rather than trying to handicap that, let's just say that what you want to do is make sure Ron Paul stays in the debates.
[02:01:19.359 --> 02:01:24.524]  And that he's not permitted to be taken off the air and that we still have free speech.
[02:01:24.584 --> 02:01:35.814]  These guys are terrified of the fact, I don't know if they're afraid he's going to win, but they're certainly terrified of the fact that he has a voice to speak up in and he's saying things that no one else is willing to say.
[02:01:35.854 --> 02:01:36.174]  I agree.
[02:01:36.254 --> 02:01:40.638]  Aaron Russo, did you see the fear of Sean Hannity when he was talking to Ron Paul face to face?
[02:01:40.798 --> 02:01:42.319]  Yeah, he wouldn't even let Ron talk.
[02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:43.380]  He wouldn't even let Ron speak.
[02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:44.241]  He was terrified.
[02:01:45.462 --> 02:01:51.643]  Show is a giant a-hole, and he's a bad guy, and so is Bill O'Reilly, so are the people on Fox News.
[02:01:51.663 --> 02:02:04.205]  But what we have to do, this guy in Michigan who's trying to set up these, who's trying to get Ron Paul out of the debates and fill his petition, we have to not just have a petition.
[02:02:04.225 --> 02:02:14.487]  We're going to get all 50,000 people in my organization, and I want all the people that listen to you on the radio to start calling the Republican Party.
[02:02:19.909 --> 02:02:21.250]  We've got to do this right now.
[02:02:21.310 --> 02:02:27.233]  In fact, I'm getting the numbers as you speak to the RNC nationally, to all of these people.
[02:02:27.253 --> 02:02:27.933]  You're absolutely right.
[02:02:27.953 --> 02:02:29.614]  Aaron Russo, stay there.
[02:02:29.674 --> 02:02:30.515]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:31.015 --> 02:02:32.796]  On the other side, we'll play these clips.
[02:02:32.836 --> 02:02:34.016]  Go to more of your calls.
[02:02:34.397 --> 02:02:41.000]  Continual coverage of the elites counter-revolution against Congressman Ron Paul and the American people.
[02:02:48.755 --> 02:02:54.242]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.603 --> 02:03:02.193]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.941 --> 02:03:10.004]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.384 --> 02:03:21.809]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.129 --> 02:03:26.051]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.091 --> 02:03:28.012]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.352 --> 02:03:32.194]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.666 --> 02:03:50.891]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:03:51.052 --> 02:03:59.140]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:06.447]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:04:06.607 --> 02:04:07.888]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:04:07.988 --> 02:04:13.871]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:04:14.071 --> 02:04:19.153]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:04:19.273 --> 02:04:28.137]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:04:28.417 --> 02:04:31.699]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:04:45.449 --> 02:04:46.290]  Attention gardeners!
[02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:48.712]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[02:04:48.952 --> 02:04:53.276]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[02:04:53.476 --> 02:05:01.342]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[02:05:01.662 --> 02:05:04.483]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[02:05:04.783 --> 02:05:12.306]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[02:05:12.406 --> 02:05:18.008]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[02:05:18.228 --> 02:05:23.790]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[02:05:24.070 --> 02:05:27.391]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[02:05:27.631 --> 02:05:30.952]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[02:05:31.192 --> 02:05:36.236]  GCN listeners who want to grow Derv's Chief Superfood should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[02:05:36.276 --> 02:05:39.139]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:05:39.159 --> 02:05:39.379]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:05:50.342 --> 02:05:50.982]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.643 --> 02:05:52.703]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.403 --> 02:05:54.524]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.164 --> 02:05:55.984]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.745 --> 02:05:57.645]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.305 --> 02:06:02.107]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.487 --> 02:06:06.529]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.348 --> 02:06:19.153]  Well, the shockwaves going across the country as the sleeping giant awakens, has even gotten Aaron Russo battling cancer, tooth and nail, and it's a tough fight for him.
[02:06:19.173 --> 02:06:21.694]  We pray for him every day around my supper table.
[02:06:23.234 --> 02:06:27.416]  It's gotten him to call in, to be on air, folks.
[02:06:27.436 --> 02:06:29.077]  That lets you know how serious this is.
[02:06:29.884 --> 02:06:30.585]  Well, it's critical
[02:06:58.153 --> 02:07:01.631]  Look, right now the country's facing a deep, deep crisis.
[02:07:02.489 --> 02:07:11.215]  And it's particularly critical that Ron Paul stay in these debates, and we do not allow the Republican Party to throw him off, because he's the only one who's speaking the truth.
[02:07:11.876 --> 02:07:14.117]  Otherwise, we have nothing but a bunch of hacks up there.
[02:07:14.678 --> 02:07:20.322]  And the fact of the matter is that he voiced his opinion, and after voicing his opinion, they're trying to get rid of him.
[02:07:20.962 --> 02:07:21.323]  Okay?
[02:07:21.403 --> 02:07:23.704]  In America, you're still supposed to have free speech here.
[02:07:24.405 --> 02:07:28.488]  And the fact is, everybody listening to this show today, I implore you,
[02:07:29.048 --> 02:07:31.029]  To call up the Republican National Committee?
[02:07:31.069 --> 02:07:36.492]  This is an attack on your free speech and your children's free speech and their children's free speech!
[02:07:36.752 --> 02:07:40.373]  This is a direct attack on the first article of the Bill of Rights!
[02:07:40.474 --> 02:07:45.436]  The heart of America is under attack publicly by these bastards!
[02:07:45.796 --> 02:07:50.939]  This is the move to completely take over and dominate the population of the United States.
[02:07:51.199 --> 02:07:54.020]  Ron Paul is our best hope, you know.
[02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:55.861]  I discussed this a few months back.
[02:07:56.261 --> 02:07:58.643]  You were talking about it with me privately, yeah.
[02:07:58.663 --> 02:07:59.183]  Shut him down!
[02:07:59.203 --> 02:07:59.844]  Shut them all down!
[02:08:17.117 --> 02:08:27.942]  Let them know damn well that nobody will ever vote Republican, that the Republican Party is finished if they're going to deny free speech to the candidates, and not let the voice of the people be heard.
[02:08:28.562 --> 02:08:28.922]  Okay?
[02:08:29.382 --> 02:08:38.106]  And it takes a call to the Republican National Committee, it takes a call to that guy in Michigan, who's passing this around, who doesn't want Ron Paul anymore in the debate.
[02:08:38.146 --> 02:08:40.707]  Yeah, his name is Saul and Anas.
[02:08:41.328 --> 02:08:42.228]  Ananas, excuse me.
[02:08:42.688 --> 02:08:43.749]  No, that was a real accident.
[02:08:44.209 --> 02:08:45.209]  Saul Ananas.
[02:08:45.810 --> 02:08:46.430]  Saul Ananas?
[02:08:47.791 --> 02:08:48.832]  Or whatever his name is.
[02:08:49.312 --> 02:08:51.153]  We've got to put out the phone numbers.
[02:08:51.474 --> 02:08:52.875]  We've got to put out the emails.
[02:08:52.915 --> 02:08:56.497]  We have to inundate them with millions and millions of emails.
[02:08:56.878 --> 02:08:58.519]  They never try this crap again.
[02:08:58.959 --> 02:09:08.426]  And we support Ron Paul because what happened the other night with Giuliani on the debate with Ron Paul has opened the door for us in a big, big, big way.
[02:09:08.587 --> 02:09:09.287]  The floodgates!
[02:09:09.787 --> 02:09:10.328]  Exactly.
[02:09:10.608 --> 02:09:13.871]  We have opened the door in a big way and they've got to get rid of Ron now.
[02:09:14.711 --> 02:09:15.591]  I'm telling you something.
[02:09:15.611 --> 02:09:17.011]  You know I know Nick Rockefeller.
[02:09:17.031 --> 02:09:18.672]  You know I know these guys.
[02:09:18.752 --> 02:09:21.052]  I know their plans and their moves.
[02:09:21.072 --> 02:09:29.414]  They are in the stage now, the beginning of the end, the end of the final act, to get things going.
[02:09:29.894 --> 02:09:30.214]  You know?
[02:09:30.334 --> 02:09:35.975]  And we also know that Giuliani's law firm is behind the... NAFTA Highway is young.
[02:09:35.995 --> 02:09:36.895]  NAFTA Highway?
[02:09:37.255 --> 02:09:38.515]  Let that come up in the debates.
[02:09:39.716 --> 02:09:41.156]  Let that come up in the debates.
[02:09:42.102 --> 02:09:44.284]  Let all this shit come out in the debates finally.
[02:09:44.544 --> 02:09:49.108]  We have a man who can get up and speak the truth about what's really happening in this country.
[02:09:49.568 --> 02:09:50.649]  And we cannot lose him.
[02:09:50.689 --> 02:09:52.731]  We cannot allow the Republican Party to lose him.
[02:09:53.051 --> 02:09:54.252]  We have to cause a revolt.
[02:09:54.292 --> 02:09:57.314]  This is the Boston Tea Party, folks.
[02:09:57.875 --> 02:09:58.475]  This is it.
[02:09:58.555 --> 02:10:03.159]  If they try to get rid of Ron Paul now, as far as I'm concerned, there's no holds barred.
[02:10:03.965 --> 02:10:04.546]  This is it.
[02:10:05.026 --> 02:10:06.148]  This is the game.
[02:10:06.248 --> 02:10:07.549]  Right now, we've got to stop it.
[02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:11.173]  And everybody listening to this show, please listen to what I'm telling you something.
[02:10:11.594 --> 02:10:12.575]  This is the time.
[02:10:12.875 --> 02:10:13.756]  This is the place.
[02:10:14.056 --> 02:10:15.057]  This is the moment.
[02:10:15.478 --> 02:10:19.202]  We've got to act now and do whatever it takes.
[02:10:19.262 --> 02:10:20.043]  Put out those phones.
[02:10:20.083 --> 02:10:24.686]  You're absolutely right, and I've been unable to properly telegraph that today.
[02:10:24.706 --> 02:10:27.087]  I think you really crystallized it, Aaron Russo.
[02:10:27.167 --> 02:10:36.732]  I feel it in my gut, and I'm telling you, they look panicked, they look scared, the Democrats look scared, they all look scared, and it's not just of Ron Paul, it's on every issue.
[02:10:37.152 --> 02:10:48.719]  They want to put Hillary in, they know the Republicans are all dead ducks, they know they're all a pack of crooks except for Ron Paul, and they are scared to death right now because he can walk in there and he can win that presidency.
[02:10:49.119 --> 02:10:51.202]  Do you know they took my movie off Google?
[02:10:51.302 --> 02:10:52.865]  They censored my movie off of Google?
[02:10:53.405 --> 02:10:57.070]  Yes, they've also been erasing Terror Storm and then re-uploading it.
[02:10:57.431 --> 02:10:59.934]  They're playing all sorts of games right now, folks.
[02:11:00.175 --> 02:11:03.119]  But they've censored my movie because Ron Paul's in the movie.
[02:11:03.743 --> 02:11:06.285]  They censored my movie off of Google.
[02:11:06.725 --> 02:11:08.306]  Google claims they don't censor.
[02:11:08.727 --> 02:11:10.388]  That's another thing we should be doing.
[02:11:10.788 --> 02:11:22.077]  It's time to get really, really... MySpace officially admitted that we have a screenshot that Prison Planet is banned from being promoted on MySpace through bulletins.
[02:11:22.217 --> 02:11:26.580]  I mean, it's just their... Folks, that shows that we're hurting them, doesn't it, Aaron?
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:27.981]  Oh, we're hurting them big time.
[02:11:28.021 --> 02:11:29.262]  I'm telling you, I know these guys.
[02:11:29.302 --> 02:11:30.443]  We're hurting them big time.
[02:11:30.823 --> 02:11:34.065]  They're terrified of us, they're afraid, because we're the only ones doing it.
[02:11:34.505 --> 02:11:36.366]  And we've got to act now.
[02:11:36.886 --> 02:11:37.806]  We've got to act now.
[02:11:37.906 --> 02:11:42.028]  And Ron Paul is our next movement here, you know, that's our next step.
[02:11:42.509 --> 02:11:46.030]  To protect Ron and support him in every way that we possibly can.
[02:11:46.511 --> 02:11:51.333]  Get on the phone, get on your email, start sending him out by the truckload, by millions.
[02:11:51.993 --> 02:11:52.993]  You know, telephone calls.
[02:11:53.033 --> 02:11:53.814]  Keep calling up.
[02:11:53.854 --> 02:11:55.714]  Tell them you'll never vote Republican.
[02:11:55.894 --> 02:11:57.074]  And call five people.
[02:11:57.094 --> 02:11:59.195]  We're going to create a revolution here in this country.
[02:11:59.275 --> 02:12:00.995]  It's time for the revolution to start.
[02:12:01.215 --> 02:12:08.597]  And listen, when you're done calling the RNC, when you're done calling GOPAC, and we're going to get those numbers out coming up, call your local Republican congressmen and women.
[02:12:08.877 --> 02:12:12.698]  Call the local RNC and you tell them, I'm never giving money to you again.
[02:12:12.738 --> 02:12:13.858]  I'm never supporting you again.
[02:12:13.898 --> 02:12:14.979]  You pack of scum.
[02:12:15.359 --> 02:12:19.860]  You had better tell, call off the dogs and leave Ron Paul alone.
[02:12:20.380 --> 02:12:21.081]  Exactly.
[02:12:21.121 --> 02:12:26.006]  I mean, even if people don't agree with Ron Paul, they shouldn't be openly calling to restrict his free speech.
[02:12:26.346 --> 02:12:26.526]  Exactly.
[02:12:26.546 --> 02:12:29.549]  Even if you don't agree with him, this is the whole point of what America is becoming.
[02:12:29.569 --> 02:12:35.535]  It's the whole point of what's happened to America, and how are we going to get it back, and it's up to people like us to get it back.
[02:12:35.935 --> 02:12:37.797]  It's in our hands, Alex.
[02:12:37.937 --> 02:12:40.199]  It's in our hands, and the audience in the stands listening.
[02:12:40.675 --> 02:12:43.416]  And it's time to just stop talking about it.
[02:12:43.756 --> 02:12:44.737]  It's time for action.
[02:12:44.797 --> 02:12:45.937]  It's time for revolution.
[02:12:45.977 --> 02:12:46.818]  I'm telling you something.
[02:12:47.118 --> 02:12:48.478]  These guys are moving fast.
[02:12:48.979 --> 02:12:50.599]  And they know they have to move fast.
[02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:55.862]  Because they know people across this country are waking up and they gotta make it happen really quickly.
[02:12:56.422 --> 02:13:01.024]  And I won't be surprised if this next election is the last election we see in this country.
[02:13:01.144 --> 02:13:01.784]  If there is one.
[02:13:02.204 --> 02:13:03.805]  I'm telling you something.
[02:13:03.885 --> 02:13:06.066]  I know how these guys think and how they operate.
[02:13:06.587 --> 02:13:13.130]  We have to move now, and this thing with Ron Paul has given us a great, great introduction to do this.
[02:13:13.670 --> 02:13:25.455]  We have a great intro to do this thing, and we have a great man there, we have a great leader in Ron Paul, and we've also got to follow him to the end and stand beside him, and stand next to him in strong and every way.
[02:13:25.895 --> 02:13:34.678]  I have a call in to Ron now, you know, and I expect to hear from him this afternoon, and I do know that I come out of show business.
[02:13:34.818 --> 02:13:36.259]  I know something about the press.
[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:37.361]  I don't know.
[02:13:52.595 --> 02:14:06.599]  Exactly, because the polls show 75% against the war, the CIA's own assessment admits that Ron Paul is right, and Giuliani is just a stumbling, bumbling, he just effuses criminality and gangsterism.
[02:14:07.119 --> 02:14:11.940]  I mean, it literally is like a pile of vomit, you know, compared to a statesman up there on the podium.
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:21.623]  And then you see how Giuliani kept talking about the National ID Guard, and those debates, he kept slipping it in there, and we all have to have a National ID Guard now?
[02:14:22.721 --> 02:14:25.722]  Which, by the way, is over 90% unpopular.
[02:14:26.102 --> 02:14:26.482]  Of course.
[02:14:26.882 --> 02:14:30.183]  All he's trying to do is have the elite watch and go, look, he's evil.
[02:14:30.443 --> 02:14:31.544]  He'll do whatever we say.
[02:14:32.004 --> 02:14:34.285]  Well, he was here on 9-11, wasn't he?
[02:14:34.945 --> 02:14:38.506]  And so, you know, he acts like, he says, I lived through 9-11.
[02:14:38.566 --> 02:14:41.947]  Well, millions of people lived through 9-11 in New York that day.
[02:14:42.247 --> 02:14:44.868]  That doesn't mean that Dana had to run Fire and Policy.
[02:14:45.548 --> 02:14:51.390]  And just because she was in New York the day that happened doesn't give him any more authority in Fire and Policy than anybody else.
[02:14:52.296 --> 02:15:00.662]  And we have to stand up, because Ron Paul knows about foreign policy, and he knows it was our actions over there that have created this situation.
[02:15:01.583 --> 02:15:11.370]  And the press jumped all over Ron for what he said, as if somebody can't voice their point of view, as if somebody, you know, they kept saying, he's the only person!
[02:15:12.031 --> 02:15:16.194]  But they asked the same question twice, why are you running this republic when you sound like a democrat?
[02:15:17.427 --> 02:15:24.231]  When he doesn't sound like a Democrat, the main Democratic, they're trying to make it left-right.
[02:15:24.711 --> 02:15:25.091]  Exactly.
[02:15:25.131 --> 02:15:28.473]  What they're trying to do is isolate him so he can't get to the Republican primary.
[02:15:28.533 --> 02:15:31.594]  By saying that, it makes the Republican voters not want to vote for him.
[02:15:31.794 --> 02:15:33.195]  Oh yeah, we see the game plan.
[02:15:33.675 --> 02:15:35.036]  We see the game plan right there.
[02:15:35.536 --> 02:15:36.137]  Exactly.
[02:15:36.437 --> 02:15:36.917]  Exactly.
[02:15:37.077 --> 02:15:39.639]  And now they want to take him off the debate.
[02:15:39.959 --> 02:15:42.300]  Look folks, whoever is listening to the show today,
[02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:44.431]  Get on the horn.
[02:15:44.571 --> 02:15:46.131]  Take these phone numbers from Alex.
[02:15:46.171 --> 02:15:47.432]  Start calling these people.
[02:15:47.872 --> 02:15:50.433]  Go to my website freedomtofascism.com.
[02:15:50.833 --> 02:15:52.213]  Sign on as a volunteer.
[02:15:52.674 --> 02:15:54.954]  Go sign on as a volunteer so we can reach you and help.
[02:15:55.254 --> 02:15:56.295]  Let's all work together.
[02:15:56.315 --> 02:15:57.755]  Let's stop all the separation.
[02:15:58.116 --> 02:16:00.176]  Let's work together to try and save this country.
[02:16:00.516 --> 02:16:01.537]  That's what this is about.
[02:16:01.877 --> 02:16:02.437]  Absolutely.
[02:16:02.477 --> 02:16:05.798]  Now what's happened is Ron Paul was on for a full hour last month with us.
[02:16:06.298 --> 02:16:10.120]  And I knew he was getting new staff legislatively and with his campaign.
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:10.820]  Right.
[02:16:17.250 --> 02:16:29.558]  Well, regardless, I literally, even though they all know who I am, and they go, no we haven't asked the Congressman, I can't get through to him now, even though Ron Paul said on the air last time he was on, the majority of his support came from this show.
[02:16:29.738 --> 02:16:41.085]  That is, I didn't ask for him to say that, we want to support him, I can't get through the so-called handlers now, so if you do talk to him, say Alex Jones wants to have you on, because Fox News, and that means the Pentagon,
[02:16:41.585 --> 02:16:43.268]  He's afraid of that nexus point.
[02:16:43.308 --> 02:16:47.796]  That's why they attacked it and said he shouldn't be allowed in the debates because he comes on this show.
[02:16:48.117 --> 02:16:52.585]  He needs to come out even stronger and come back on this show and not give them what they want.
[02:16:53.303 --> 02:16:55.725]  Well, I should be speaking to him this afternoon.
[02:16:56.426 --> 02:17:00.329]  And if that should happen, and I anticipate it, well, I will give him that message.
[02:17:00.749 --> 02:17:01.990]  Yeah, just that I can't get through.
[02:17:02.010 --> 02:17:07.835]  I mean, I'm not even going to go to his fundraiser this weekend and all, because I'm trying to finish Endgame, Aaron.
[02:17:08.035 --> 02:17:13.940]  You talk about Endgame, which, by the way, you feature in largely as folks will see in the film.
[02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:16.342]  We went and interviewed you when you were getting treatment in Houston.
[02:17:16.642 --> 02:17:17.623]  And I pray for you, Aaron.
[02:17:17.643 --> 02:17:18.764]  I do pray for you every day.
[02:17:18.784 --> 02:17:19.985]  And you know I love you.
[02:17:20.005 --> 02:17:21.746]  I mean, how are you doing?
[02:17:21.766 --> 02:17:22.707]  I've been able to get ahold of you.
[02:17:23.442 --> 02:17:24.602]  Well, I'm doing fine.
[02:17:24.622 --> 02:17:27.483]  You know, I have a lot of physical problems.
[02:17:28.244 --> 02:17:31.725]  You know, I'm having kidney problems, and I have the cancer problems.
[02:17:31.925 --> 02:17:34.906]  And, uh, you know, I have a lot of things that I'm dealing with.
[02:17:35.026 --> 02:17:38.287]  I don't want to wear you out, but when we come back... Stay there, stay there, then.
[02:17:38.307 --> 02:17:39.587]  When we come back, I'm going to get the numbers out.
[02:17:39.647 --> 02:17:41.328]  Get your pens and paper ready, folks.
[02:17:41.648 --> 02:17:42.849]  Get up to the starting line.
[02:17:43.009 --> 02:17:44.009]  We're going to run them over.
[02:17:46.189 --> 02:17:49.070]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:17:49.410 --> 02:17:52.291]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:17:52.511 --> 02:17:58.713]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:19:03.715 --> 02:19:09.459]  There has been talk coming from the Council of Foreign Relations of forming an American Union combining Canada, Mexico and the U.S.
[02:19:09.559 --> 02:19:10.960]  and erasing economic borders.
[02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:17.925]  Bush met with Vincent Fox, President of Mexico, Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, discussing a security and prosperity partnership.
[02:19:18.145 --> 02:19:21.688]  The formation of a North American Union will have a great impact on the U.S.
[02:19:21.728 --> 02:19:22.248]  economy.
[02:19:22.489 --> 02:19:27.232]  Jerome R. Corsi published the document, The Plan to Replace the Dollar with the Emerald.
[02:19:27.452 --> 02:19:28.873]  The sovereignty of the U.S.

[02:20:45.372 --> 02:20:50.334]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming and the end of the world?
[02:20:50.634 --> 02:20:52.534]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[02:20:52.714 --> 02:20:55.775]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:20:55.935 --> 02:20:59.076]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:20:59.396 --> 02:21:01.237]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[02:21:01.497 --> 02:21:05.199]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:21:05.479 --> 02:21:08.140]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible!
[02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:13.063]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:21:13.263 --> 02:21:17.505]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:21:17.965 --> 02:21:22.288]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[02:21:22.588 --> 02:21:26.850]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:33.054]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[02:21:33.354 --> 02:21:35.795]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:21:35.995 --> 02:21:36.496]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:21:36.516 --> 02:21:37.616]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[02:21:52.427 --> 02:21:56.088]  Ron Paul is the Republican frontrunner.
[02:21:56.908 --> 02:22:01.749]  He has won all the major polls until Fox when he was ahead 33 points to 27.
[02:22:02.909 --> 02:22:06.070]  And then they demonized him for three hours and it went down.
[02:22:06.110 --> 02:22:07.250]  He was a close second.
[02:22:08.790 --> 02:22:09.630]  Almost first.
[02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:15.251]  And he has got massive grassroots support for people that are politically informed.
[02:22:15.591 --> 02:22:19.672]  And right now the views covering him, as we talked about earlier, we've got that up on JonesReport.com.
[02:22:20.592 --> 02:22:22.514]  All these other great things are happening.
[02:22:23.434 --> 02:22:26.016]  It is just so amazingly exciting.
[02:22:26.677 --> 02:22:28.038]  And let me give you the phone numbers.
[02:22:29.279 --> 02:22:34.823]  GOPAC is headed up by former Congressman J.C.
[02:22:34.943 --> 02:22:35.343]  Watts.
[02:22:35.503 --> 02:22:37.004]  I remember defending J.C.
[02:22:37.044 --> 02:22:38.605]  Watts when he used to get attacked by the Democrats.
[02:22:40.407 --> 02:22:43.249]  And former Congressman J.C.
[02:22:43.289 --> 02:22:46.071]  Watts and GOPAC Michael Steele.
[02:22:46.111 --> 02:22:47.252]  Now it's Michael Steele
[02:22:48.237 --> 02:22:55.925]  Who is saying that we need to ban Ron Paul and that the First Amendment's evil.
[02:22:56.025 --> 02:22:58.127]  I mean, literally, they're saying that he's winning.
[02:22:58.187 --> 02:22:58.587]  We've got it.
[02:22:58.627 --> 02:23:01.210]  Number one, they've got to cheat and kick him off because he's winning.
[02:23:01.230 --> 02:23:02.391]  That's totally un-American.
[02:23:02.611 --> 02:23:03.592]  Pure scum right there.
[02:23:04.870 --> 02:23:06.351]  I mean, that is just disgusting.
[02:23:06.411 --> 02:23:07.452]  Number one, they want to cheat.
[02:23:08.073 --> 02:23:13.517]  Number two, they want to destroy the First Amendment and the electoral process and the voting process.
[02:23:13.978 --> 02:23:15.699]  And not let you see Ron Paul.
[02:23:16.100 --> 02:23:18.982]  I mean, folks, if he gets the nomination, it's over.
[02:23:19.863 --> 02:23:25.507]  Then, I mean, it'll be such an educational process, him up there with that witch Hillary, that we'll have a revolution regardless.
[02:23:26.108 --> 02:23:27.529]  Here's the number for GOPAC.
[02:23:27.629 --> 02:23:28.150]  Here it is.
[02:23:28.170 --> 02:23:32.073]  And later we're going to have these numbers posted on Prison Planet and InfoWars and Jones Report.
[02:23:33.255 --> 02:23:34.956]  And there was a petition.
[02:23:35.056 --> 02:23:35.977]  Go up there, get them.
[02:23:36.317 --> 02:23:38.138]  This is where it can go viral, is the net.
[02:23:38.198 --> 02:23:42.401]  That's why we're going to put this on the web, and then it's got to go viral on the web.
[02:23:43.582 --> 02:23:45.443]  Go get the stories off Present Planet, get them out.
[02:23:45.463 --> 02:23:45.843]  202-464-5170.
[02:23:45.863 --> 02:23:46.023]  202-464-5170.
[02:23:46.123 --> 02:23:48.245]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[02:23:48.265 --> 02:23:50.786]  Go to the sound of the guns on this one.
[02:23:58.772 --> 02:23:59.593]  Get blurbs out.
[02:23:59.613 --> 02:24:00.313]  Get emails out.
[02:24:00.333 --> 02:24:04.517]  You want to write an article for us about how they're trying to slit his throat treacherously and everything they're doing?
[02:24:04.557 --> 02:24:04.897]  Write it.
[02:24:04.937 --> 02:24:06.639]  Send it to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[02:24:06.659 --> 02:24:07.199]  We'll post it.
[02:24:07.459 --> 02:24:09.221]  We need the material, the angles, everything.
[02:24:09.261 --> 02:24:10.242]  Take action, people!
[02:24:10.262 --> 02:24:11.823]  202-464-5170.
[02:24:12.904 --> 02:24:16.787]  I'm going to call them during the next break.
[02:24:17.288 --> 02:24:18.248]  And then the RNC.
[02:24:18.269 --> 02:24:19.650]  This is more important than GOPAC.
[02:24:20.871 --> 02:24:22.212]  You call and you let them know.
[02:24:23.149 --> 02:24:24.293]  We are never voting for you.
[02:24:24.333 --> 02:24:27.703]  This proves you're anti-gun, you're open borders, you're North American Union.
[02:24:27.724 --> 02:24:28.867]  We know you're a bunch of trash.
[02:24:29.308 --> 02:24:30.332]  But now, this is it.
[02:24:31.013 --> 02:24:32.975]  Your party is going to end up being like the Whigs.
[02:24:33.095 --> 02:24:33.495]  It's over.
[02:24:33.755 --> 02:24:40.861]  And by the way, you remind them, William F. Buckley said two weeks ago that if the party doesn't get anti-war and go ahead and turn against all this, that it's dead.
[02:24:41.402 --> 02:24:42.783]  Your party is gone!
[02:24:42.803 --> 02:24:43.784]  Do you understand?
[02:24:44.084 --> 02:24:44.544]  Gone!
[02:24:44.584 --> 02:24:48.147]  And the Democrats are close, too, because their constituents are figuring out what's going on.
[02:24:48.427 --> 02:24:51.590]  Your party is gone, you scumbags!
[02:24:52.310 --> 02:24:54.052]  Maybe that's been your goal all along, though.
[02:24:55.822 --> 02:25:04.026]  2-0-2-8-6-3-8-5-0-0 2-0-2-8-6-3-8-5-0-0 I want cops in their squad cars.
[02:25:04.366 --> 02:25:07.207]  I want people hauling aggregate in their dump trucks calling.
[02:25:07.568 --> 02:25:10.989]  I want school teachers to say, excuse me, I've got to go to the school conference room.
[02:25:11.389 --> 02:25:14.711]  I want, you know, people up on high-rises, riveting stuff to call.
[02:25:15.111 --> 02:25:16.432]  I'm going to call during the next break.
[02:25:16.592 --> 02:25:17.272]  R-N-C 2-0-2-8-6-3-8-5-0-0 That's 2-0-2.
[02:25:24.155 --> 02:25:31.757]  8-6-3-8-5-0-0 for the scumbag RNC, a pack of un-American trash.
[02:25:31.997 --> 02:25:35.638]  Now you call that scum, and you let them know we're not going along with this.
[02:25:36.198 --> 02:25:37.158]  Now, Aaron Russo?
[02:25:37.178 --> 02:25:44.620]  I want to say that when you call the RNC, you tell them straight up, I will never ever vote Republican again.
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:46.761]  I will switch from Republican to Independent.
[02:25:47.421 --> 02:25:48.621]  You'll never have me again.
[02:25:48.641 --> 02:25:51.222]  The Republican Party is anti-American.
[02:25:51.282 --> 02:25:52.502]  It's anti-free speech.
[02:25:53.104 --> 02:25:56.107]  And you guys better start waking up to what the people of this country want.
[02:25:56.567 --> 02:25:59.269]  And stop being run by these goddamn friggin' neocons.
[02:25:59.890 --> 02:26:00.310]  Okay?
[02:26:01.331 --> 02:26:04.193]  And stop letting the elite run this party.
[02:26:04.293 --> 02:26:09.137]  Aaron, Aaron, I understand you're upset and everything, but please, let's try not to take the Lord's name in vain.
[02:26:09.157 --> 02:26:14.822]  I understand you're fighting cancer for your life in a hospital bed, and they're attacking Ron Paul and America's dying.
[02:26:15.022 --> 02:26:16.063]  No, no, I apologize.
[02:26:16.123 --> 02:26:17.384]  I'm telling you not to do that, but go ahead.
[02:26:17.404 --> 02:26:19.205]  No, no, no, no, you're 100% correct.
[02:26:19.305 --> 02:26:19.926]  Not a problem.
[02:26:20.382 --> 02:26:22.404]  And I just want to say one more thing.
[02:26:22.464 --> 02:26:31.312]  If they remove Ron Paul from these debates, and I'm going to tell you straight up right now, it's my call to start a revolution in this country.
[02:26:32.553 --> 02:26:33.614]  That's how I feel about it.
[02:26:33.674 --> 02:26:35.236]  That's how strongly I feel about it.
[02:26:35.336 --> 02:26:38.238]  It will be time for a revolution in this country.
[02:26:38.699 --> 02:26:39.660]  If that will be the end of it.
[02:26:40.501 --> 02:26:42.622]  Well, I mean, we're trying to do this peaceably.
[02:26:43.182 --> 02:26:46.183]  Well, you know, it could only be peaceable for so long.
[02:26:46.243 --> 02:26:48.304]  No, I agree, and these bastards won't let that happen.
[02:26:48.324 --> 02:26:49.664]  Well, what did JFK say?
[02:26:49.704 --> 02:26:56.546]  He said, those that make peaceful revolutions impossible, make violent revolutions inevitable.
[02:26:56.606 --> 02:26:57.287]  Inevitable, yeah.
[02:26:57.727 --> 02:26:58.267]  Exactly.
[02:26:58.507 --> 02:26:59.387]  And that's what's happening.
[02:26:59.747 --> 02:27:04.129]  If they take Ron Paul off the debate, it's time for America to start a revolution, folks.
[02:27:04.744 --> 02:27:07.525]  Because I, for one, will not live in the New World Order.
[02:27:07.926 --> 02:27:10.067]  I will not allow these guys to control my life.
[02:27:10.587 --> 02:27:12.067]  To control this world anymore.
[02:27:12.408 --> 02:27:14.068]  I know where these guys are coming from.
[02:27:14.469 --> 02:27:16.330]  I will not be implanted with chips.
[02:27:16.430 --> 02:27:17.970]  I will not carry an ID card.
[02:27:18.531 --> 02:27:19.951]  None of this is going to be happening.
[02:27:20.451 --> 02:27:21.552]  And we've got to stop it.
[02:27:21.792 --> 02:27:22.132]  Now.
[02:27:22.572 --> 02:27:26.814]  And we've got to protect Ron Paul and protect our freedoms in this country.
[02:27:27.155 --> 02:27:28.055]  What's ever left of them.
[02:27:28.075 --> 02:27:31.977]  Because otherwise, we don't deserve... Let me get a final word from you on the other side, Aaron.
[02:27:31.997 --> 02:27:32.797]  Stay there, my friend.
[02:27:32.817 --> 02:27:33.938]  Aaron Russo.
[02:27:36.295 --> 02:27:37.236]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.676 --> 02:27:39.337]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.217 --> 02:27:42.979]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.521 --> 02:27:47.501]  How are you feeling today?
[02:27:47.721 --> 02:27:48.182]  Why ask?
[02:27:48.222 --> 02:27:54.305]  Because if you have health challenges, then reading our free e-booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[02:27:54.545 --> 02:27:58.948]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call Mangosteen.

[02:28:39.019 --> 02:28:44.782]  Again, that's 800-658-0597.
[02:28:46.082 --> 02:28:48.484]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:28:49.104 --> 02:28:53.386]  Did you know that the United Nations has never fulfilled its sole goal for existing?
[02:28:53.906 --> 02:28:55.147]  Maintaining world peace?
[02:28:55.727 --> 02:28:56.648]  Do you know why?
[02:28:56.828 --> 02:28:59.089]  Everywhere they've been involved, it becomes worse.
[02:28:59.722 --> 02:29:04.184]  You can call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine by calling 1-800-516-8736.
[02:29:04.325 --> 02:29:11.548]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:29:13.950 --> 02:29:14.970]  Call now.
[02:29:15.851 --> 02:29:18.252]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:29:18.912 --> 02:29:25.136]  Did you know the rogue nations and terrorist organizations have been purchasing suitcase nuclear bombs on the black market?
[02:29:25.896 --> 02:29:27.237]  Will they use them on America?
[02:29:27.845 --> 02:29:33.832]  You can receive an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine by calling our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[02:29:45.996 --> 02:29:50.038]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:50.259 --> 02:29:53.640]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:53.821 --> 02:29:57.323]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:57.563 --> 02:30:00.845]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:30:00.865 --> 02:30:06.308]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:30:06.348 --> 02:30:11.571]  When we do our programs, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[02:30:11.971 --> 02:30:12.672]  We're good to go.
[02:30:23.386 --> 02:30:27.809]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:27.829 --> 02:30:29.270]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:29.430 --> 02:30:32.352]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:30:32.372 --> 02:30:33.893]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:31:02.851 --> 02:31:08.732]  We're good to go.
[02:31:38.198 --> 02:32:06.822]  You know, I said I'd make a big announcement, and I want to do it with the guys on the show, and we're going to let you know more about it, but obviously it was going to be the Loose Change crew on The View, the 24th, and we weren't going to talk about that because we knew Neal Collins would try to stop that free speech as well, but ABC put out a press release today on it, and the other little tidbit is I am executive producing
[02:32:07.694 --> 02:32:08.735]  With the crew.
[02:32:08.755 --> 02:32:10.576]  A loose change final cut.
[02:32:10.736 --> 02:32:12.157]  And yeah, Charlie Sheen's on board.
[02:32:12.177 --> 02:32:15.959]  The film is just, it's taking a while to do because it's so good.
[02:32:15.979 --> 02:32:19.381]  And because, you know, they're getting clearance on all the footage and the rest of it.
[02:32:20.042 --> 02:32:25.685]  And so I'm going to have them on sometime this week to really fill you in on the details.
[02:32:25.705 --> 02:32:28.027]  And I was just honored when they called me and invited me into it.
[02:32:28.347 --> 02:32:29.167]  I never sought it out.
[02:32:29.187 --> 02:32:32.649]  I guess I was the only person didn't seek out to get involved in the project.
[02:32:32.669 --> 02:32:34.891]  Because I just like everybody out there doing their own deal.
[02:32:34.931 --> 02:32:36.312]  And I'm honored to be involved and to be
[02:32:37.728 --> 02:32:37.988]  We're good.
[02:32:56.614 --> 02:33:06.364]  Neocon lobbying pack that just sucks up foreign money and uses it to basically put in Neocons.
[02:33:06.964 --> 02:33:12.249]  So the 202-464-5170 isn't as important as the RNC.
[02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:13.150]  Here's the key number.
[02:33:13.471 --> 02:33:18.035]  Call this, email this out, give this to everyone, take action, go completely insane.
[02:33:18.455 --> 02:33:19.797]  I mean, get aggressive folks.
[02:33:20.317 --> 02:33:24.419]  I'm going to call him again after the show, and I'm going to call an hour after that until I can get through.
[02:33:24.439 --> 02:33:29.502]  See, the key is, tonight, when the phones stop ringing, you've got to call again, or have your neighbors call, or call tomorrow.
[02:33:29.802 --> 02:33:31.182]  Just call it every day this week.
[02:33:32.003 --> 02:33:40.747]  Or we're going to be hearing Ron Paul, the party's decided, is an evil commie, because he's against big government, and we'll be not having him in the debate anymore.
[02:33:41.403 --> 02:33:44.204]  They'll go, that's good, another victory for America against free speech.
[02:33:44.224 --> 02:33:45.424]  202-863-8500.
[02:33:45.444 --> 02:33:46.784]  202-863-8500.
[02:33:47.264 --> 02:33:57.206]  If you don't know who your Republican congressman or woman is, or they're not in your district, the district next to you, find out.
[02:33:57.226 --> 02:33:58.087]  It'll take about five minutes.
[02:33:58.787 --> 02:34:03.828]  You can go to the RNC website, you can call the Capitol, call and ask who your congressperson is.
[02:34:04.728 --> 02:34:05.868]  You need to know that anyways.
[02:34:06.028 --> 02:34:06.729]  And just call them.
[02:34:09.637 --> 02:34:17.383]  We have the installed Michael McCall here, Janet Reno's top lieutenant, who's now the big Republican and owns the Voting Machine Company, that is his father-in-law.
[02:34:17.423 --> 02:34:19.125]  Clear Channel does, everybody votes for him on.
[02:34:19.425 --> 02:34:21.927]  Doesn't matter if he's 15 points behind in polls, he magically wins.
[02:34:22.247 --> 02:34:23.588]  So we do have that type of stuff going on.
[02:34:23.608 --> 02:34:24.049]  202-863-8500.
[02:34:24.069 --> 02:34:24.229]  202-863-8500.
[02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:25.310]  Call him right now.
[02:34:25.350 --> 02:34:28.652]  Aaron, any other comments or points that you want to make, my friend?
[02:34:36.032 --> 02:34:46.659]  I think it's important that we give out email addresses to send emails to as well, because phone calls may be difficult getting through on a lot of times, and they can start ending with millions of emails.
[02:34:46.759 --> 02:34:47.980]  Again, it's very important.
[02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:57.446]  And so we've got to get email addresses out there, and we've got to get to that guy in Michigan who started his petition to stop Blancpain from being on the dates.
[02:34:57.466 --> 02:34:59.187]  We've got to call every radio station.
[02:34:59.827 --> 02:35:00.448]  We're good to go.
[02:35:15.386 --> 02:35:16.147]  This is a battle.
[02:35:16.207 --> 02:35:19.629]  We need everybody we can get on every level to help us.
[02:35:20.269 --> 02:35:24.212]  Call every other radio station host, you know, and get them to be doing the same thing.
[02:35:24.492 --> 02:35:28.494]  Like I just called you, you know, and get people on this case.
[02:35:28.754 --> 02:35:30.575]  I'm telling you folks, this is it.
[02:35:30.736 --> 02:35:31.316]  This is the game.
[02:35:31.892 --> 02:35:32.753]  This is it right now.
[02:35:32.813 --> 02:35:33.893]  Ron's our best chance.
[02:35:33.973 --> 02:35:34.734]  They want to stop him.
[02:35:34.774 --> 02:35:38.176]  This is the start of the final battle.
[02:35:38.636 --> 02:35:39.136]  Exactly.
[02:35:39.156 --> 02:35:40.217]  This is the beginning of the end.
[02:35:41.017 --> 02:35:45.080]  And like I said to you before, I'm not afraid to say this, it's time for revolution.
[02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:49.782]  If they get Ron Paul off these debates, then there's nothing left.
[02:35:50.703 --> 02:35:52.524]  And it's time for whatever we gotta do.
[02:35:53.306 --> 02:35:54.667]  And I'm not afraid to call for that.
[02:35:55.207 --> 02:36:04.553]  Well, Aaron, we know there was a long train of abuses, and they wouldn't let candidates that won office, they would dissolve legislatures, they would ban debates.
[02:36:04.933 --> 02:36:11.577]  This is the exact kind of stuff that King George did, King George III did, and I mean, what type of revolution are you talking about?
[02:36:12.097 --> 02:36:17.761]  I'm talking about a revolution, as I say on my website, you know, there's no boundaries to what you must do to preserve your freedom.
[02:36:19.085 --> 02:36:20.286]  That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[02:36:20.366 --> 02:36:21.907]  And what's the full Kennedy quote again?
[02:36:21.927 --> 02:36:26.471]  Those that make peaceful revolutions impossible, make violent revolutions inevitable?
[02:36:26.811 --> 02:36:27.011]  Yep.
[02:36:28.152 --> 02:36:28.933]  They make it inevitable.
[02:36:28.993 --> 02:36:32.896]  If you're not allowed to protest, if you don't have a voice, eventually you can become violent.
[02:36:32.916 --> 02:36:35.118]  Because you're just stifling the people.
[02:36:35.158 --> 02:36:36.239]  You're suppressing everything.
[02:36:37.703 --> 02:36:51.727]  Have you seen the new photos and footage of a guy out front of a recruiting office in Boston just standing on a milk crate and speaking out against torture and the troops come out and beat him up and the cops take him to jail and say he's a terrorist?
[02:36:52.967 --> 02:36:55.107]  No, I didn't see that.
[02:36:55.127 --> 02:36:58.368]  Tell me that one more time please.
[02:36:58.988 --> 02:37:00.729]  Well no, it's all over the place.
[02:37:02.299 --> 02:37:05.461]  No, I mean, there's photos of it, and the eyewitness reports of it, and they say there's video.
[02:37:05.481 --> 02:37:06.241]  I'm going to get them on.
[02:37:06.782 --> 02:37:13.286]  But, you know, the famous Abu Ghraib picture with the guys with his hands out, and he's got like the blanket with his head through it, and the bag over his head?
[02:37:13.306 --> 02:37:13.806]  Right.
[02:37:14.006 --> 02:37:17.828]  Okay, well, you know, they do that protest everywhere, standing on a milk crate, just like they did there.
[02:37:18.389 --> 02:37:25.513]  And he did that on a Boston street in front of a recruiting office, and the troops came out and just beat the daylights out of him, the cops stood there, and then took him to jail.
[02:37:26.756 --> 02:37:32.441]  I haven't seen that, but nothing surprises me anymore.
[02:37:32.821 --> 02:37:33.822]  We've waited too long.
[02:37:34.322 --> 02:37:35.483]  We've just waited too long.
[02:37:35.543 --> 02:37:36.384]  It's time to act.
[02:37:37.125 --> 02:37:38.166]  It's time to do something.
[02:37:38.206 --> 02:37:39.267]  Let me ask you a question, Aaron.
[02:37:39.307 --> 02:37:43.870]  Do you or do you not see fear in the neocons and the liberals' eyes on television?
[02:37:44.371 --> 02:37:45.392]  Let me put it this way.
[02:37:45.412 --> 02:37:46.793]  What I see is that
[02:37:48.382 --> 02:37:49.984]  They're rushing to the goal line.
[02:37:50.204 --> 02:37:51.666]  They think that they're almost there.
[02:37:51.686 --> 02:37:55.370]  And they see resistance starting in a bigger, bigger way.
[02:37:55.930 --> 02:37:58.293]  And they know it's going to be a battle to get to the end.
[02:37:58.313 --> 02:38:02.538]  And they're trying to rush it there and stop it and keep everybody intimidated.
[02:38:03.098 --> 02:38:03.759]  We're good to go.
[02:38:26.473 --> 02:38:34.442]  And I think what happened with Ron Paul, get out of their control, and I think that they see the potential of what can happen.
[02:38:34.462 --> 02:38:38.728]  Remember, he won the MSNBC debate and they didn't even announce that anywhere.
[02:38:39.562 --> 02:38:43.845]  Then he won the Fox Debate, basically, you know, and it started to get around.
[02:38:43.865 --> 02:38:52.210]  And now you have people like The View picking up on it this morning and saying, well, what Ron Paul said was a good thing, and there's another point of view there.
[02:38:52.671 --> 02:38:58.995]  And now they're trying to take him off of debates altogether and silence up all the people who believe as we believe in freedom.
[02:38:59.902 --> 02:39:03.364]  And, uh, look, what's happening is that there's a takeover in America.
[02:39:03.404 --> 02:39:05.125]  America is no longer America.
[02:39:05.165 --> 02:39:06.026]  That's what you have to get.
[02:39:06.586 --> 02:39:10.528]  All the stuff that's happening is all part of the same tapestry.
[02:39:11.069 --> 02:39:12.730]  It's all part of the same fabric.
[02:39:13.170 --> 02:39:17.432]  You know, people look at, you know, each individual little thing as if they're separate.
[02:39:17.472 --> 02:39:17.953]  They're not.
[02:39:18.313 --> 02:39:20.494]  This is all part of one big fabric.
[02:39:21.254 --> 02:39:23.796]  And, uh, you know, they're trying to weave the whole cloth.
[02:39:24.723 --> 02:39:26.566]  And we've got to stop it now.
[02:39:26.586 --> 02:39:31.837]  I mean, I don't want to live in this kind of a country in this kind of a world where they're taking us.
[02:39:31.958 --> 02:39:33.341]  I really don't want that.
[02:39:34.342 --> 02:39:41.023]  Well, you're right, Aaron Russo, and the problem with tyranny is once, I mean, Michelle Malkin saying we all need to be put in camps, ban, arrest people.
[02:39:41.643 --> 02:39:45.704]  They're not, I mean, they wouldn't be going that public if they weren't desperate, and they are desperate.
[02:39:45.744 --> 02:39:47.144]  Now, I want to talk about you for a moment.
[02:39:47.765 --> 02:39:49.205]  I've tried to call you a few times.
[02:39:49.925 --> 02:39:51.345]  You usually call me every week.
[02:39:51.705 --> 02:39:53.466]  I haven't heard from you in about a month and a half.
[02:39:53.586 --> 02:39:58.107]  I know that you're really fighting, I mean, let's be honest, you're a tough guy.
[02:39:58.447 --> 02:40:00.027]  You've had cancer for over four years.
[02:40:01.087 --> 02:40:02.248]  Well, nobody really knows.
[02:40:02.268 --> 02:40:03.369]  The truth is that I feel good.
[02:40:03.409 --> 02:40:04.410]  I feel mentally very, very strong.
[02:40:04.450 --> 02:40:06.451]  Physically, I have some definite problems.
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:52.174]  But hasn't affected me mentally I have definitely having kidney problems the cancer has definitely affected my kidney and You know I have I'm getting renal failure, but it keeps getting bad getting better And then getting worse and getting better than getting worse and the truth is right at this moment in time I don't think anybody knows.
[02:40:52.254 --> 02:40:53.575]  I think it's in the Lord's hands and
[02:40:54.461 --> 02:41:05.763]  And all I know, what's best for me is that I keep doing what I do best, and espousing my point of view, and saying what I believe in, and trying to live my life in a good way.
[02:41:05.803 --> 02:41:09.064]  And if the Lord decides to take me, you know, I'm ready to go.
[02:41:09.584 --> 02:41:14.064]  And if He wants me to stay here, I'll stay here, and I'll fight till the very end.
[02:41:14.784 --> 02:41:21.406]  You know, I'm just doing everything that I can possibly do to take care.
[02:41:21.446 --> 02:41:22.826]  So I've got some
[02:41:24.387 --> 02:41:28.089]  You know, most of the medicine I'm taking doesn't really work for me.
[02:41:28.109 --> 02:41:30.450]  You know, I stopped the chemotherapy.
[02:41:30.470 --> 02:41:31.150]  I did it twice.
[02:41:31.190 --> 02:41:31.891]  I won't do that.
[02:41:31.931 --> 02:41:33.591]  I won't do... I never did radiation.
[02:41:33.611 --> 02:41:34.352]  I won't do it.
[02:41:35.352 --> 02:41:44.376]  But I have these other kinds of machines that I'm using, you know, that deal with, you know, the vibrations in the body.
[02:41:44.536 --> 02:41:45.937]  One is called the beam ray machine.
[02:41:47.069 --> 02:41:48.830]  And I'm doing that.
[02:41:48.890 --> 02:41:51.091]  I'm doing some other things.
[02:41:51.191 --> 02:41:53.612]  I feel good.
[02:41:53.772 --> 02:41:54.912]  Mentally, I feel very good.
[02:41:55.173 --> 02:41:56.953]  I'm working on a new movie.
[02:41:57.934 --> 02:41:59.374]  I'm trying to write a new movie.
[02:41:59.394 --> 02:42:00.315]  Let me ask you, Aaron.
[02:42:00.795 --> 02:42:03.416]  I saw you a few months ago in Houston for Endgame.
[02:42:03.736 --> 02:42:05.577]  Were you doing better than you were then or worse?
[02:42:06.117 --> 02:42:09.218]  It depends on what your definition of better and worse is.
[02:42:09.238 --> 02:42:09.659]  Physically?
[02:42:09.679 --> 02:42:11.719]  Mentally, I'm doing better.
[02:42:11.779 --> 02:42:12.320]  Physically...
[02:42:13.903 --> 02:42:16.987]  I'd say I was pretty much in the same place that I was then.
[02:42:18.549 --> 02:42:20.471]  Well my friend, you're a trooper.
[02:42:20.751 --> 02:42:22.313]  Are you at home or at the hospital right now?
[02:42:22.653 --> 02:42:22.994]  I'm home.
[02:42:23.434 --> 02:42:23.775]  I'm home.
[02:42:24.636 --> 02:42:26.638]  You know, I don't want to spend time in the hospital.
[02:42:26.698 --> 02:42:28.160]  If I'm going to go, I'd rather be home.
[02:42:29.381 --> 02:42:30.302]  You know, with my family.
[02:42:32.709 --> 02:42:34.750]  I don't feel like I'm ready to go.
[02:42:34.970 --> 02:42:35.471]  I just don't.
[02:42:35.551 --> 02:42:37.212]  I don't think I'm going to go.
[02:42:37.452 --> 02:42:39.773]  You're not going to go.
[02:42:40.454 --> 02:42:42.075]  You were good at sports and everything else.
[02:42:42.095 --> 02:42:43.656]  You're a national arm wrestling champion.
[02:42:43.696 --> 02:42:45.136]  You know it's all about having the guts.
[02:42:45.357 --> 02:42:47.998]  There's no doubt you'd have been dead years ago if you didn't have the will, Aaron.
[02:42:48.358 --> 02:42:50.400]  You just hang in there for Ron Paul and America.
[02:42:50.740 --> 02:42:52.521]  I'm going to call you after the show today, my friend.
[02:42:53.221 --> 02:42:53.842]  God bless you.
[02:42:54.222 --> 02:42:55.483]  I want to tell you something.
[02:42:55.543 --> 02:42:56.683]  You're an inspiration.
[02:42:56.723 --> 02:42:57.284]  You really are.
[02:42:58.413 --> 02:43:00.674]  You're an inspiration because you're really a good man.
[02:43:00.694 --> 02:43:03.396]  When I first started listening to you I didn't know who you were really.
[02:43:03.416 --> 02:43:04.476]  I wasn't sure about you.
[02:43:05.137 --> 02:43:08.799]  But I've come to know you really well and you've done nothing but impress me.
[02:43:08.819 --> 02:43:13.682]  And I've got tremendous respect for you and admiration for you.
[02:43:13.802 --> 02:43:16.003]  You say what you believe and you believe what you say.
[02:43:16.023 --> 02:43:18.264]  And you're a good guy.
[02:43:20.106 --> 02:43:27.690]  You know, it's fun for me to know people like yourself and lots of other people in this movement who stand up for what's right.
[02:43:27.710 --> 02:43:39.295]  You know, like I said, I've met a lot of people who I don't care for in this movement, you know, who are just people who just want to take advantage of the situation and just want to gossip and spread things around.
[02:43:39.315 --> 02:43:40.816]  You've got to be careful of those people.
[02:43:41.396 --> 02:43:45.178]  But there's some great people in this movement who understand what freedom is really about.
[02:43:46.074 --> 02:43:54.061]  And who want to stand together, and it's time we all stood together, and like I say, you know, it might be time for revolution.
[02:43:54.081 --> 02:43:56.283]  They're not leaving us a lot of room anymore.
[02:43:56.303 --> 02:43:59.046]  Let me do this.
[02:43:59.206 --> 02:44:08.534]  As this Ron Paul situation develops, Aaron, let me get you back up tomorrow or the next day, because this is all moving fast, and we'll talk to you then, my friend, and I'll pray for you tonight.
[02:44:08.954 --> 02:44:09.435]  As you wish.
[02:44:09.455 --> 02:44:10.075]  Whatever you like.
[02:44:10.196 --> 02:44:11.096]  Anything for you, Alex.
[02:44:11.437 --> 02:44:12.017]  Thank you, Aaron.
[02:44:12.037 --> 02:44:12.778]  Call your cell phone?
[02:44:13.436 --> 02:44:14.377]  Yeah, cool, cool, cool.
[02:44:14.397 --> 02:44:15.778]  You have the phone number, don't you?
[02:44:16.158 --> 02:44:16.418]  Sure.
[02:44:16.738 --> 02:44:17.819]  Yeah, cool ass number.
[02:44:17.939 --> 02:44:19.480]  And listen, we're listening.
[02:44:19.500 --> 02:44:20.421]  God bless you all.
[02:44:21.161 --> 02:44:22.322]  Stand up for what's right.
[02:44:22.362 --> 02:44:23.443]  Don't be afraid of death.
[02:44:24.383 --> 02:44:27.925]  And just stand up for what we gotta do and take the fight to them.
[02:44:28.766 --> 02:44:29.867]  Absolutely, my friend.
[02:44:30.027 --> 02:44:30.607]  Godspeed.
[02:44:31.007 --> 02:44:31.608]  God bless you.
[02:44:32.028 --> 02:44:32.969]  Now, what a great guy.
[02:44:33.029 --> 02:44:35.370]  By the way, he doesn't like to talk about it.
[02:44:36.151 --> 02:44:37.251]  It's serious, folks.
[02:44:37.271 --> 02:44:39.493]  I mean, he's had surgery after surgery after surgery.
[02:44:40.584 --> 02:44:44.948]  I'm not going to go into any details, but I've seen people fight cancer, die of cancer.
[02:44:44.968 --> 02:44:45.248]  He's tough.
[02:44:45.268 --> 02:44:46.128]  He just doesn't want to die.
[02:45:01.162 --> 02:45:07.845]  Oh, this whole Ron Paul thing going on, it's just so, I just, you know, it's good to be able to talk to Aaron because I know there'll be a come a time when we don't get to talk to anybody.
[02:45:08.226 --> 02:45:18.191]  You better kiss your wife, you better kiss your husband, you better hug your children, you better go see your grandma, you better go see your parents in that nursing home, because once they're past that gulf, folks, you're not going to see them again in this life.
[02:45:18.851 --> 02:45:20.031]  They're going to be out of your touch.
[02:45:20.972 --> 02:45:24.154]  That's why when I live, that's why in my life, I do want to be a good person.
[02:45:24.174 --> 02:45:25.014]  It doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[02:45:26.235 --> 02:45:27.596]  Doesn't mean I don't blow up at people.
[02:45:27.636 --> 02:45:28.576]  Doesn't mean any of that.
[02:45:28.616 --> 02:45:29.296]  None of us are pervert.
[02:45:29.336 --> 02:45:30.737]  We just gotta work together, folks.
[02:45:31.377 --> 02:45:40.661]  I mean, all the radio networks, all the patriots, everybody, all of us have gotta, you know, just have a new beginning and just focus on defeating the New World Order because they're the real enemy.
[02:45:42.261 --> 02:45:46.343]  Alright, let's start playing the Michelle Malkin traitor as they attack Ron Paul and spew a bunch of bull.
[02:45:46.363 --> 02:45:47.523]  I meant to play this an hour ago.
[02:45:47.903 --> 02:45:49.664]  I meant to comment on every facet of it.
[02:45:49.704 --> 02:45:50.424]  I won't have time.
[02:45:50.464 --> 02:45:53.145]  Paul Watson's done that up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:45:53.525 --> 02:45:54.726]  Paul's beating his brains out.
[02:45:55.899 --> 02:45:56.220]  We're good to go.
[02:46:15.454 --> 02:46:17.296]  So, help us get all those stories out to everybody.
[02:46:17.336 --> 02:46:18.357]  I mean, just go crazy.
[02:46:18.697 --> 02:46:20.299]  Get them out aggressively, I'm asking you.
[02:46:20.719 --> 02:46:29.168]  Here they are saying, kill the First Amendment, ban Ron Paul from the debates, the evil 9-11 virus has taken over, oh, we're so evil, we need to be kicked out of the country, here it is.
[02:46:31.272 --> 02:46:36.534]  The big outrage, Presidential Heavyweight Rudy Giuliani vs. Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:46:36.614 --> 02:46:44.916]  The duo's 9-11 contest got a little spicy at last night's GOP debate in South Carolina after Paul suggested that the U.S.
[02:46:45.357 --> 02:46:47.757]  actually had a hand in the terrorist attack.
[02:46:48.017 --> 02:46:50.138]  They attack us because we've been over there.
[02:46:50.198 --> 02:46:52.039]  We've been bombing Iraq for 10 years.
[02:46:52.919 --> 02:46:54.259]  We've been in the Middle East.
[02:46:54.459 --> 02:46:55.920]  I think Reagan was right.
[02:46:56.280 --> 02:47:00.121]  We don't understand the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics.
[02:47:00.241 --> 02:47:07.143]  As an extraordinary statement, as someone who lived through the attack of September 11th, that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq.
[02:47:07.463 --> 02:47:11.984]  I don't think I've ever heard that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th.
[02:47:15.845 --> 02:47:19.706]  I can ask the Congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that.
[02:47:20.561 --> 02:47:23.543]  And that was Republican versus Republican.
[02:47:24.024 --> 02:47:32.390]  According to a recent Rasmussen Report poll, 35% of Democrats think President Bush knew about the 9-11 attacks beforehand.
[02:47:32.850 --> 02:47:37.954]  This so-called 9-11 truth movement has already infected people like Rosie O'Donnell
[02:47:38.554 --> 02:47:45.060]  And one in three Democrats, and many other Americans, evidently, including Congressman Ron Paul.
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:49.524]  With me now, Fox News contributor and syndicated columnist, Michelle Malkin.
[02:47:49.884 --> 02:47:52.226]  So Michelle, this stuns me.
[02:47:52.927 --> 02:48:00.594]  It wouldn't have stunned me had it come up in the Democratic debate, but it's a jaw-dropper to see it in the Republican debate.
[02:48:01.488 --> 02:48:09.049]  It is, and it doesn't belong there, and I'm glad that this moment provided great TV for Fox News.
[02:48:09.850 --> 02:48:26.953]  It was a very instructive exchange, but Ron Paul really has no business being on stage as a legitimate representative of Republicans, because the 9-11 truth virus is something that infects only a very small proportion of people that would
[02:48:27.273 --> 02:48:30.017]  All right, you're the virus, and we're the cure, you trash!
[02:48:49.244 --> 02:48:54.693]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:55.053 --> 02:49:02.705]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.385 --> 02:49:10.449]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.849 --> 02:49:22.275]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.575 --> 02:49:26.057]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.538 --> 02:49:28.479]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.799 --> 02:49:32.661]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:46.110 --> 02:49:51.333]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.473 --> 02:49:59.558]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.818 --> 02:50:06.882]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:07.022 --> 02:50:07.662]  We're good to go!
[02:50:34.247 --> 02:50:34.567]  We're good.
[02:50:45.945 --> 02:50:47.666]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:47.886 --> 02:50:51.589]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:51.909 --> 02:50:54.130]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[02:50:54.631 --> 02:51:00.855]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:51:01.015 --> 02:51:05.918]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:06.118 --> 02:51:15.064]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[02:51:15.444 --> 02:51:21.466]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.
[02:51:21.706 --> 02:51:24.787]  Turn your internet on and off with one simple switch.
[02:51:24.887 --> 02:51:27.988]  There's no software to load and it's so easy to install.

[02:51:39.891 --> 02:51:44.933]  That's Net, the number 7, Tech.com and start protecting yourself today!
[02:51:46.490 --> 02:51:56.356]  Because the 9-11 truth virus is something that infects only a very small proportion of people that would identify themselves as conservative.
[02:51:56.436 --> 02:51:57.036]  Stop right there!
[02:51:57.836 --> 02:51:58.917]  See, that's all lies.
[02:51:59.017 --> 02:52:01.118]  Oh, it's a very small group of conservatives.
[02:52:01.138 --> 02:52:01.879]  Oh, very small.
[02:52:01.899 --> 02:52:06.001]  99% of Americans in CNN polls are against the North American Union.
[02:52:06.641 --> 02:52:09.323]  Okay, 84% of Americans believe the government's lying about 9-11.
[02:52:10.809 --> 02:52:13.850]  36% in a poll over a year old now believe it's a total inside job.
[02:52:14.350 --> 02:52:17.291]  Shut up, traitor, and quit using group mind-control politics.
[02:52:17.612 --> 02:52:18.612]  Back to the scumbag.
[02:52:19.372 --> 02:52:35.938]  People that would identify themselves as conservative or Republican, and as you say, John, this is far more prevalent, this strain of 9-11 truth or virus, on the left and in much of the mainstream of the Democrat Party, as that Rasmussen poll showed.
[02:52:36.038 --> 02:52:36.338]  Why?
[02:52:36.358 --> 02:52:37.099]  Why did 35%...
[02:52:38.699 --> 02:52:41.000]  Again, they're desperately trying to hear Republicans.
[02:52:41.720 --> 02:52:46.121]  We watch on television, you know, Republican vs. Republican, is Ron Paul a Republican?
[02:52:46.461 --> 02:52:56.004]  They're desperately trying to get mindless groupthink to switch in, so that they don't lose that small percentage of conservatives that still believe that the new world order is good.
[02:52:56.284 --> 02:52:56.625]  Here it is.
[02:52:56.645 --> 02:53:04.507]  A percent of Democrats believe it, and I think it's another 26% haven't quite made up their mind about it.
[02:53:05.267 --> 02:53:10.672]  Well, I think part of it is what Charles Krauthammer has famously called Bush Derangement Syndrome.
[02:53:11.012 --> 02:53:18.998]  I think that pathology has taken hold among many Democrats who would consider themselves mainstream.
[02:53:19.398 --> 02:53:29.466]  So anything that they could do to suspect or blame him for America's problems, and particularly the terrorist attack, they're willing to believe.
[02:53:29.486 --> 02:53:32.448]  I think a lot of it is just plain ignorance.
[02:53:32.988 --> 02:53:47.104]  And then there's the paranoid strain on the left, I talked about this in my book on Hinged, of tinfoil hat wearers who indulge in this kind of fantasy where America bears the blame for global jihad.
[02:53:48.065 --> 02:53:52.570]  You know, Michelle, Rosie talks about this stuff all the time on The View.
[02:53:53.596 --> 02:53:55.757]  And the view has a large audience.
[02:53:56.897 --> 02:54:07.841]  Would this notion be as prevalent as it is if there weren't prominent people like Rosie, Charlie Sheen and others constantly talking it up?
[02:54:09.025 --> 02:54:12.188]  Well, they certainly do bear blame for mainstreaming it.
[02:54:12.308 --> 02:54:17.352]  Rosie O'Donnell and Alec Baldwin and Charlie Sheen, I believe.
[02:54:18.173 --> 02:54:26.700]  But it's there on the internet and these people are absolutely rabid and they are impervious to reason or logic.
[02:54:27.541 --> 02:54:33.123]  It's great that we have magazines, publications like Popular Mechanics that are out there slogging every day.
[02:54:33.383 --> 02:54:38.924]  There are a lot of blogs as well that have been debunking a lot of these 9-11 conspiracy theories.
[02:54:38.964 --> 02:54:51.468]  This war is going on on places like YouTube and in social networking places, but I think it's incumbent on mainstream news outlets to debunk these people, and I don't think you see nearly enough of that outside of Fox News.
[02:54:51.488 --> 02:54:56.549]  Part of this 9-11 truth movement says that the United States attacked the Pentagon
[02:54:57.369 --> 02:54:59.451]  With missiles that a plane did not hit it.
[02:54:59.991 --> 02:55:10.258]  I have never been able to understand how the 9-11 truthers then explain where is American Flight 77 and where are all those people?
[02:55:10.538 --> 02:55:12.459]  Have you ever heard them try to explain that?
[02:55:13.668 --> 02:55:31.843]  You know, I try not to spend too much time in these cesspools, but it is worth taking a visit to places like, you know, these WTC7 sites and Students and Scholars for Truth, and I note that Ron Paul has basically allied himself with these people.
[02:55:31.883 --> 02:55:40.250]  He appears with Students for Truth on campus, and he's appeared on radio shows like 9-11 Conspiracy Nut, Alex Jones, and I would hope that
[02:55:40.530 --> 02:55:45.392]  That that would disqualify him the next time around from appearing on stage with other Republicans.
[02:55:45.452 --> 02:55:45.952]  We shall see.
[02:55:45.992 --> 02:55:46.792]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:55:46.992 --> 02:55:52.894]  Yeah, we shall see, because trash like you is all about FEMA camps and writes articles about how we should all be put in camps.
[02:55:54.534 --> 02:55:57.195]  You are a criminal, Michelle Malkin.
[02:55:57.235 --> 02:56:00.576]  It is criminal to call for putting whole groups of people in camps.
[02:56:02.097 --> 02:56:07.738]  And talk about banning people's free speech in debates they're already in, because they should be disqualified.
[02:56:08.258 --> 02:56:09.979]  Listen to you, you piece of trash.
[02:56:10.786 --> 02:56:12.628]  All your stupid little followers.
[02:56:13.189 --> 02:56:14.490]  Look at you plunge in the ratings.
[02:56:14.510 --> 02:56:16.312]  Look at your websites fall off to nothing.
[02:56:16.532 --> 02:56:18.814]  Because people aren't buying your bull anymore.
[02:56:19.254 --> 02:56:20.416]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:20.636 --> 02:56:21.637]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:21.877 --> 02:56:24.620]  It all starts again at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:25.481]  God bless you all.
