[00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.152]  Let's have a quiz to the commentators.
[00:00:06.192 --> 00:00:08.353]  Who do you want to know about?
[00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:11.914]  He's got the soul of all God of America.
[00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:15.096]  He's got the deep side of entertainment.
[00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:17.877]  He's got the death commission.
[00:00:17.897 --> 00:00:19.438]  He's got the dark side.
[00:00:19.478 --> 00:00:22.019]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.740]  Call Alex now, toll free.
[00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.508]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:29.048 --> 00:00:36.093]  It is Sunday, May 20th, 2007 as we broadcast the syndicated
[00:00:47.578 --> 00:00:52.542]  Transmission all over the United States from the studios of NewsRadio 590, KLVJ.
[00:00:52.682 --> 00:00:56.566]  I want to thank all our great Eminem affiliates that do pick up the show.
[00:00:56.626 --> 00:00:57.967]  The drumming listeners signing on.
[00:00:58.447 --> 00:01:09.797]  We're also on Global Shortwave and of course have the largest internet audience publicly rated by Shoutcast and many other indices at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:12.131]  Bigger than NPR Radio.
[00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.393]  National Online.
[00:01:13.413 --> 00:01:14.574]  Bigger than Associated Press.
[00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:17.378]  Bigger than USA Radio Network combined.
[00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:18.480]  Welcome.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.782]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:01:19.842 --> 00:01:22.886]  And we only... It's like John Wayne said, no brag, just fact.
[00:01:23.453 --> 00:01:25.474]  Now, the alternative media is exploding.
[00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:30.776]  We are beginning in many forums and areas and genres to dwarf the mainstream media.
[00:01:31.237 --> 00:01:32.197]  We're on the march.
[00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:33.578]  The empire is on the run.
[00:01:34.278 --> 00:01:40.941]  My website is rated, just one of my websites, prisonplanet.com, is rated over 50,000 places above Bill O'Reilly's website.
[00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:45.343]  Prison Planet is rated over 20,000 places now above Rush Limbaugh.
[00:01:45.663 --> 00:01:48.905]  And we are closing in on the Drudge Report, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:51.093 --> 00:01:58.237]  Despite the fact that last week MySpace admitted that they censor PrisonPlanet.com bulletins and the word Prison Planet.
[00:01:58.497 --> 00:02:02.299]  This is an official admission by Rupert Murdoch's Fox-owned MySpace.
[00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.120]  They are censoring me.
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.825]  They're also trying to censor Ron Paul because they're trying to stop what Fox News, attacking myself and Ron Paul last week, said was a viral spread of information.
[00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.127]  No, you're the virus, New World Order.
[00:02:14.187 --> 00:02:15.628]  Fake liberals, fake conservatives.
[00:02:15.928 --> 00:02:17.230]  You really work for the big banks.
[00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.252]  You're here to pacify the public as we go into the New World Order.
[00:02:20.693 --> 00:02:21.814]  Your fraud is over.
[00:02:21.894 --> 00:02:22.955]  Your fraud is failing.
[00:02:23.235 --> 00:02:25.457]  The American people and the sleeping giant are rising.
[00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:28.299]  Hard enough tooting the old horn.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.681]  Today, I may not take phone calls.
[00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:33.384]  I see the phones are already loading up without me even giving the phone number out.
[00:02:34.073 --> 00:02:38.075]  I can't do two hours without taking a few, so we will, but let's say in the last segment of each hour.
[00:02:38.115 --> 00:02:38.955]  I'll take some calls.
[00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:43.218]  If you want to hold, quick comments, kind of like radio graffiti as I've heard it called.
[00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.379]  We'll give each person about 45 seconds or so.
[00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:52.302]  That number is 877-590-5525 to give a chance for people that aren't regulars who load the phones up before the show even starts.
[00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:53.483]  877-590-5525 or locally in Central Texas, 836-0590.
[00:02:59.744 --> 00:03:01.505]  We're to start here.
[00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:04.045]  It is just an unbelievable amount of news.
[00:03:04.906 --> 00:03:07.426]  The amnesty plan is total amnesty.
[00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:10.987]  What you're hearing on most mainstream news is disinfo.
[00:03:11.047 --> 00:03:13.748]  The media is being fed disinfo by the government.
[00:03:13.768 --> 00:03:23.311]  We have four senators on record who have seen the subsections of the still secret bill that the President and the Senate agreed on last week for total amnesty.
[00:03:23.611 --> 00:03:28.393]  But we have some of the subsections thanks to several different senators.
[00:03:28.413 --> 00:03:29.413]  We're going to go over those.
[00:03:30.653 --> 00:03:35.634]  It is a Z visa, which doesn't make you leave the country.
[00:03:35.654 --> 00:03:39.755]  It lets you stay here, unlimited, and to bring in 11 of your family members.
[00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:41.515]  But it's worse than that.
[00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:46.237]  It's unlimited skilled and unskilled worker visas issued by Fortune 500 companies.
[00:03:46.537 --> 00:03:49.677]  If they request the foreign workers, it'll now be unlimited.
[00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:52.638]  And the good news is this cover-up got blown wide open.
[00:03:52.678 --> 00:03:57.419]  It is now public that not only is it total amnesty, but the Republicans and the Democrats
[00:03:58.332 --> 00:04:04.199]  The leadership, the crooks, the people that work for the foreign corporations that have overthrown the country, we can still get it back if we just admit that.
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.983]  They have now been caught lying, red-handed as usual.
[00:04:08.996 --> 00:04:10.977]  But there's something on top of this far worse.
[00:04:11.037 --> 00:04:18.819]  The AP and Reuters are reporting that over 20% of our troops in Iraq are illegal aliens who were legalized, predominantly from Latin America, Mexico.
[00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:27.061]  They're now expanding recruiting stations from Manila, Philippines, to Germany, from Berlin, but mainly Mexico City.
[00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:31.442]  Foreign troops to make up our main troop formations, and now out of the AP.
[00:04:32.523 --> 00:04:34.383]  This is Friday, my friends.
[00:04:34.743 --> 00:04:36.584]  You're not going to hear this on the NEOCON talk shows.
[00:04:37.085 --> 00:04:41.456]  They're there to neutralize conservatives, remember that, and keep you from actually waking up to what's happening.
[00:04:41.877 --> 00:04:45.907]  Santa Fe Police Department looking into hiring Mexican nationals.
[00:04:47.397 --> 00:04:49.598]  By the time they tell you about it, it's already happening.
[00:04:49.638 --> 00:04:52.638]  In fact, I pulled an article up from December of last year.
[00:04:52.738 --> 00:04:52.958]  U.S.
[00:04:52.998 --> 00:04:55.359]  military may recruit foreigners to serve.
[00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:57.099]  This is out of the Boston Globe.
[00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.400]  It was also in Christian Science Monitor.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.001]  And then the next paragraph says they may expand.
[00:05:03.061 --> 00:05:04.781]  See, they tell you, oh, they may do it.
[00:05:04.881 --> 00:05:05.881]  That's spin.
[00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:06.762]  Oh, it hasn't happened yet.
[00:05:07.002 --> 00:05:13.043]  You read the next sentence and it says, oh, it's already 20% of the troops in combat, but it's going to be even more now.
[00:05:13.945 --> 00:05:15.907]  And then, of course, will they be loyal to the country?
[00:05:15.947 --> 00:05:16.507]  Of course not.
[00:05:16.827 --> 00:05:19.249]  A clear sign of an oppressed domestic population.
[00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:34.521]  The Caesars, after the Roman Republic was overthrown, began bringing in foreign Visigoths, Goths, Austria Goths, and Britons in to actually be the domestic police force to oppress the Roman citizenry.
[00:05:35.582 --> 00:05:37.584]  And by the way, they are following this to a T.
[00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:41.369]  Okay, so the same thing is happening.
[00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.330]  We'll go over that for you.
[00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:48.433]  And bottom line, amnesty opens the door for foreign occupation of the United States.
[00:05:48.453 --> 00:05:52.195]  But the good news is they try this every year and the people block it.
[00:05:53.215 --> 00:05:56.237]  The problem, though, is that we already basically have amnesty.
[00:05:56.717 --> 00:05:57.858]  Associated Press has reported.
[00:05:58.258 --> 00:05:59.339]  No ID card.
[00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:00.900]  You get a bank account for illegal aliens.
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.981]  The cops don't arrest them for no insurance.
[00:06:03.121 --> 00:06:03.821]  It's on record.
[00:06:04.141 --> 00:06:04.982]  They're above the law.
[00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:14.344]  In fact, in Seattle, we now have the video, the raw video of it, on May Day Parade this year, up there when the illegals, remember three weeks ago, were out protesting for Blanket Amnesty.
[00:06:15.104 --> 00:06:19.427]  Anyone who came out with signs to protest them peaceably was arrested and put in paddy wagons.
[00:06:19.767 --> 00:06:22.368]  No First Amendment in America for the citizens.
[00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:23.609]  There is for the illegals.
[00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:30.113]  And by the way, I'm putting that in the film endgame that I've almost completed about the North American Union and the New World Order.
[00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:32.882]  So again, they are above the law on every front.
[00:06:32.902 --> 00:06:34.863]  So we'll cover that for you.
[00:06:34.923 --> 00:06:39.666]  The foreign police and military to rule over the American people.
[00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:44.869]  And that dovetails with a total disinfo piece of... well, the Seattle Times carried it.
[00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:47.650]  It was originally put in the St.
[00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.691]  Louis Post-Dispatch.
[00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:52.733]  Urban legend of North American Union feeds on fears.
[00:06:53.273 --> 00:06:55.955]  And they attack Ron Paul and Lou Dobbs and say they're liars.
[00:06:56.627 --> 00:06:59.389]  Folks, I have the four-year documents with the North American Union.
[00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:08.876]  It was signed in March 23, 2005 at Baylor University in Texas, just north of where I sit, an hour and a half from me, or roughly 90 miles away.
[00:07:10.037 --> 00:07:13.099]  And it's all on record, and we're inside of it right now.
[00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:18.523]  This is like the media saying that Washington, D.C.
[00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:22.766]  doesn't exist, or George Washington didn't exist, or Jesus didn't exist, or
[00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:26.300]  Ronald Reagan didn't exist.
[00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:29.081]  People read this and believe it!
[00:07:31.322 --> 00:07:35.564]  They also mention that there's delusional people that say they're planning to get rid of the currency.
[00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:40.366]  I have the Foreign Relations, Foreign Affairs, CFR publication.
[00:07:40.746 --> 00:07:42.687]  This came out the May-June issue.
[00:07:43.388 --> 00:07:45.749]  This is put out by the most powerful people in America, 2007.
[00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:47.870]  End of national currency.
[00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.191]  And it says North American Union and they're getting rid of the dollar.
[00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:52.206]  About here!
[00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:56.648]  They say it, it's being implemented, and guaranteed it's a CFR member.
[00:07:56.968 --> 00:08:01.991]  I bet if you check, either the editor or whoever gave the order to Philip Dine for the St.
[00:08:02.011 --> 00:08:03.532]  Louis Post-Dispatch's CFR.
[00:08:04.252 --> 00:08:06.913]  Because they know the general public doesn't read elitist publications.
[00:08:08.574 --> 00:08:14.857]  I thought I'd play the new British Prime Minister, the guy that'll be replacing Blair, Gordon Brown, calling for a one world government, new world order.
[00:08:15.117 --> 00:08:17.058]  He just gave this last week, I have that.
[00:08:17.947 --> 00:08:18.788]  But here's the problem.
[00:08:18.808 --> 00:08:22.270]  How am I going to get to the foreign police are going to rule over us?
[00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:25.433]  How do I get to the foreign troops are going to rule over us?
[00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:27.374]  How do I get to this?
[00:08:28.315 --> 00:08:31.177]  You know, a few months ago I ran it and raved and people couldn't believe me.
[00:08:32.018 --> 00:08:35.861]  They go into schools unannounced and put guns to children's heads and say they're going to kill them.
[00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:37.582]  They do it to teachers who don't know.
[00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:41.025]  They literally have breakdowns and go to mental institutions in many cases.
[00:08:42.226 --> 00:08:43.807]  And this is USA Today.
[00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:46.569]  Teachers stage fake gun attacks on children.
[00:08:47.362 --> 00:08:49.784]  That's an AP carrying us here today.
[00:08:50.725 --> 00:08:55.048]  Here at Associated Press, teacher students panic by fake gun drill at high school.
[00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:56.089]  Now, one was in Tennessee.
[00:08:56.309 --> 00:08:57.089]  This one's in Phoenix.
[00:08:57.109 --> 00:08:58.130]  They didn't even tell the teachers.
[00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.753]  This was last week, and I thought I'd go over that.
[00:09:02.053 --> 00:09:07.557]  I've interviewed the teachers where they come in the portable building, put guns to their heads, and say, I'm going to kill you, dressed up in camouflage.
[00:09:08.576 --> 00:09:10.558]  And, of course, it's all trauma-based mind control.
[00:09:10.598 --> 00:09:11.558]  It's all federally funded.
[00:09:11.758 --> 00:09:14.681]  But, see, you see this in your regional news and think, oh, it's an accident.
[00:09:14.981 --> 00:09:16.202]  Oh, the locals screwed up.
[00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:19.424]  No, we'll tell you later why they're doing that.
[00:09:19.844 --> 00:09:25.788]  Also, top FBI experts in the crime lab say that the single-bullet theory killing JFK is a fraud.
[00:09:27.049 --> 00:09:31.933]  But the big news is Ron Paul and his fundraiser yesterday, and Ron Paul and the debates
[00:09:32.931 --> 00:09:35.312]  And we happen to have his speech he gave.
[00:09:35.332 --> 00:09:36.793]  We'll be hearing some of that here.
[00:09:37.253 --> 00:09:40.734]  We also happen to have Fox News attacking myself and him earlier.
[00:09:41.214 --> 00:09:43.735]  And the attempt to knock him out of the debates which we defeated.
[00:09:44.275 --> 00:09:47.297]  We'll cover Ron Paul when we get back in total detail.
[00:09:47.817 --> 00:09:48.637]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:09:48.877 --> 00:09:50.238]  PrisonPlanet.com is the site.
[00:09:50.438 --> 00:09:50.898]  Stay with us.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.102]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:10:07.442 --> 00:10:09.403]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:10:09.764 --> 00:10:17.428]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:18.089 --> 00:10:25.153]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:25.553 --> 00:10:32.497]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:37.045]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:10:37.265 --> 00:10:40.766]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:10:41.246 --> 00:10:42.927]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:10:43.487 --> 00:10:47.408]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:11:01.278 --> 00:11:05.120]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.401]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:10.143]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:11:10.443 --> 00:11:12.964]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:11:13.364 --> 00:11:15.105]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:17.727]  They've both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:11:18.787 --> 00:11:29.252]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:11:29.392 --> 00:11:33.214]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:11:33.274 --> 00:11:36.336]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:11:36.556 --> 00:11:39.018]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:11:39.098 --> 00:11:42.061]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[00:11:42.081 --> 00:11:42.782]  Call 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:11:42.822 --> 00:11:45.525]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[00:11:45.545 --> 00:11:46.165]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:06.747]  Hi, Steve Schenck, Fearless Task Force.
[00:12:07.228 --> 00:12:09.011]  Sure, you've got a mortgage and credit cards.
[00:12:09.332 --> 00:12:12.457]  Your debt creation is probably the smartest thing you've ever done.
[00:12:12.918 --> 00:12:14.541]  How would it be to find $75,000, $150,000, $200,000 or more you never knew you had?
[00:12:17.896 --> 00:12:22.340]  Now the task force has strategies to make these debts into virtual savings accounts.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.262]  Ben Franklin said, a penny saved is a penny earned.
[00:12:25.842 --> 00:12:34.309]  By doing nothing more than you're doing right now, because you've used your credit, the right strategies can make the debt part of your financial life the smartest thing you've ever done.
[00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:37.551]  Oh, by the way, your strategies cost you nothing out of pocket.
[00:12:38.212 --> 00:12:40.994]  Go ahead and check out the debt elimination scams if you'd like to.
[00:12:41.514 --> 00:12:45.978]  You wouldn't take money from a loan shark, so you may not want to give your money to a debt shark
[00:12:46.693 --> 00:12:50.219]  For an understanding of what a financial genius you truly are, call 800-409-5633.
[00:12:50.239 --> 00:12:51.080]  On the web, MyDebtFreePath.com.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:51.140]  800-409-5633.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.202]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:13:05.602 --> 00:13:08.544]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:13:08.864 --> 00:13:11.425]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:13:11.785 --> 00:13:16.607]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:13:16.987 --> 00:13:22.350]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.611]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:26.371]  We're good to go.
[00:13:49.219 --> 00:13:54.662]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:13:54.682 --> 00:13:55.242]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:58.103]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:13:58.123 --> 00:14:03.065]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:14:03.105 --> 00:14:15.431]  Coming to you from the capital of Texas, broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide,
[00:14:18.433 --> 00:14:20.693]  This is the Alex Jones Show!
[00:14:25.234 --> 00:14:25.794]  Welcome back.
[00:14:25.834 --> 00:14:27.795]  It is the 20th day of May, 2007.
[00:14:28.375 --> 00:14:32.555]  Right now, let's get into Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:14:32.615 --> 00:14:38.977]  Okay, you saw the debates earlier during the week on Fox Television.
[00:14:39.597 --> 00:14:47.058]  Really, Giuliani, we did time it out, got several minutes more than anybody else because of his relationship with the Pentagon-run Fox Network.
[00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:53.663]  And they have this whole set up to try to imply that Ron Paul was saying that America attacked itself.
[00:14:54.144 --> 00:14:57.285]  Because Fox has done TV programs trying to link him to 9-11 Truth.
[00:14:57.345 --> 00:14:59.286]  We're going to play that coming up in a few minutes.
[00:15:00.306 --> 00:15:08.410]  And yeah, Ron Paul on my radio show, which they've analyzed, has talked about our government staging terror attacks or claiming attacks have taken place like Gulf of Tonkin in the past and others.
[00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.471]  You can find those articles and audio clips on my site.
[00:15:10.811 --> 00:15:12.912]  But he hasn't talked about 9-11 specifically.
[00:15:12.932 --> 00:15:15.814]  I interviewed him a few weeks ago and he, for an hour, and he talked about
[00:15:16.724 --> 00:15:20.405]  You know, how there could be a staged provocation to get us into war with Iran.
[00:15:20.705 --> 00:15:22.005]  That's just part of the history books.
[00:15:22.045 --> 00:15:22.525]  We know this.
[00:15:23.105 --> 00:15:24.626]  We know this happens over and over again.
[00:15:24.866 --> 00:15:27.166]  They were trying to get him to talk about 9-11 truth.
[00:15:28.826 --> 00:15:38.008]  And he just simply talked about the 9-11 Commission Report and kind of the official whitewash version is that the occupation over there has stimulated hatred of the United States.
[00:15:38.048 --> 00:15:40.969]  Yeah, you don't see attacks happening on neutral Switzerland.
[00:15:42.084 --> 00:15:47.649]  Or attacks by the Muslim Al-Qaeda extremists, who really don't exist outside of black ops.
[00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:50.512]  That is the big spectacular attacks, don't they?
[00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:51.533]  There are some real terrorists.
[00:15:52.193 --> 00:15:54.936]  You don't see Japan getting attacked, and it's because they're not interventionists.
[00:15:55.356 --> 00:15:56.697]  That's why the Founding Fathers said don't do that.
[00:15:56.717 --> 00:16:05.085]  So they tried to twist that all, and then the Republican Party GOPAC chairman, Mr. Steele, right after the debate said, I'm going to move to have him kicked out of the debate.
[00:16:05.645 --> 00:16:08.808]  And then they had a few Republican Party chairmen, namely one in Michigan,
[00:16:10.085 --> 00:16:19.752]  Come out against Ron Paul on Thursday morning and it came out on a news wire that they were going to have him barred from the debates claiming he wasn't a conservative.
[00:16:19.792 --> 00:16:28.258]  No, he just has the most conservative voting record in Congressional modern history and Republican leadership has the opposite on that.
[00:16:28.278 --> 00:16:32.280]  I mean, look at the neocon public that still likes the war.
[00:16:32.341 --> 00:16:33.201]  They love Rudy.
[00:16:33.261 --> 00:16:36.083]  Gun control, abortion, as long as he warmongers, they love him.
[00:16:36.163 --> 00:16:36.924]  I mean, it's real simple.
[00:16:36.964 --> 00:16:38.845]  Kill those babies, hand in those guns,
[00:16:39.877 --> 00:16:41.858]  Be on the Saudi payroll, we don't care.
[00:16:42.138 --> 00:16:43.639]  Just destroy America and we're happy.
[00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:46.080]  As long as we wrap ourselves in a plastic flag.
[00:16:47.701 --> 00:16:49.522]  It's the symbol we want, not the real thing.
[00:16:49.542 --> 00:16:51.823]  We don't want the responsibility of a real free country.
[00:16:52.463 --> 00:16:54.284]  And so they try to kick him off the debates.
[00:16:54.464 --> 00:16:57.946]  We, my listeners, Thursday, launch the operation
[00:16:58.872 --> 00:17:04.958]  Now over 30,000 signatures have been gained on three different petitions that are out there on one petition site alone.
[00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:09.663]  We know that we gave the RNC's phone number out, you called, you took action.
[00:17:09.984 --> 00:17:11.785]  It was locked down on Friday afternoon.
[00:17:12.206 --> 00:17:21.816]  They had the chairman come out and say, okay, we're not calling for him to be barred from the debate that's coming up in a month or so, and we're not calling to block Congress from Ron Paul, we're backing off.
[00:17:22.656 --> 00:17:23.617]  I don't know.
[00:17:38.081 --> 00:17:46.325]  I mean, he's always been a household name with people who are informed and educated libertarians, real conservatives, paleo-conservatives, and even the anti-war crowd, some of the true left.
[00:17:46.985 --> 00:17:48.706]  Now he's becoming a household name everywhere.
[00:17:48.746 --> 00:17:51.728]  He won all the major MSNBC polls, one of them by 94%.
[00:17:52.268 --> 00:17:56.190]  He was winning all night until they closed the poll with the text polls.
[00:17:57.491 --> 00:18:01.373]  With the debates earlier this week, and he was winning by 33%, they closed it magically.
[00:18:01.594 --> 00:18:03.375]  He slipped to second place, Mitt Romney winning.
[00:18:03.595 --> 00:18:10.560]  But the guy that Fox News for a whole day afterwards put on their website, I have screenshots of it, as the winner, Rudy Giuliani, with a fake number.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:11.981]  They knew what they were doing, folks.
[00:18:12.021 --> 00:18:16.324]  Rudy Giuliani was a far third place with 15 percentage points.
[00:18:16.364 --> 00:18:19.206]  But again, he's anti-gun, pro-open border.
[00:18:20.827 --> 00:18:23.029]  Rupert Murdoch has been involved with this campaign.
[00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:24.470]  See, he's backing
[00:18:25.251 --> 00:18:28.912]  Giuliani, and on the other hand, Hillary, having fundraisers for and advising her.
[00:18:29.492 --> 00:18:32.333]  So that's why you got those two, and anybody else is going to be in trouble.
[00:18:32.753 --> 00:18:35.574]  But again, CNN, all of them, it's all run by the same crowd.
[00:18:35.594 --> 00:18:50.417]  I don't want to get... Once you get the idea that I'm saying Fox is particularly, you know, worse than the... I mean, look, when we were fighting Germany, you'd have, you know, there were three or four government channels that posed as free market, you know, non-controlled channels.
[00:18:51.477 --> 00:18:53.838]  Whereas one might be more vitriolic and cartoonish,
[00:18:54.355 --> 00:19:00.557]  You know, there were others that were still right-controlled, just targeting a more high-brow audience, like National Petroleum Radio.
[00:19:00.837 --> 00:19:01.558]  It's not liberal.
[00:19:01.638 --> 00:19:10.821]  NPR is the most sick, disgusting, New World Order propaganda I've ever heard, but it's all slickly packaged, snake-like, you know, salesman job, so it works.
[00:19:11.861 --> 00:19:20.965]  But Rob Paul got questioned yesterday, before he went at the press conference, by InfoWars.com's own Aaron Dykes.
[00:19:21.984 --> 00:19:23.766]  About the New World Order.
[00:19:23.786 --> 00:19:25.688]  Do we have time to play this clip before the break or play it after?
[00:19:25.908 --> 00:19:32.535]  Let's go ahead and roll a clip of the press conference as InfoWars reporter Aaron Dykes asks Ron Paul about the New World Order.
[00:19:32.615 --> 00:19:37.099]  And then Ron Paul tears into George Bush, Jr., officially kicking it off.
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:42.465]  He gets into the dollar plunging, the American empire stalling, how the elites are basically strip mining us.
[00:19:43.125 --> 00:19:43.826]  Just incredible.
[00:19:44.066 --> 00:19:45.268]  Two minutes soundbite from Ron Paul.
[00:19:45.288 --> 00:19:45.568]  Here it is.
[00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:52.277]  Is there a plan for a New World Order, a One World Government, and how do we stop it?
[00:19:52.598 --> 00:20:02.501]  Well, I think even our first President Bush said that the New World Order was in tune, and that's what they were working for.
[00:20:02.541 --> 00:20:04.302]  The UN is part of that government.
[00:20:04.522 --> 00:20:07.783]  They're working right now very significantly for a North American Union.
[00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:10.844]  That's why there's a lot of people in Washington who don't care too much about our borders.
[00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:14.876]  They have a philosophic belief that national sovereignty is not important.
[00:20:15.196 --> 00:20:21.379]  It's also the reason I have made a very strong suggestion that we need not be in the United Nations for our national security.
[00:20:21.919 --> 00:20:24.600]  What do you think about our borders and immigration policy?
[00:20:25.601 --> 00:20:27.122]  Our borders have been totally neglected.
[00:20:27.402 --> 00:20:33.284]  We worry more about the borders between North and South Korea and between Iraq and Syria than we do about our own.
[00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:39.567]  Just recently a bunch of our border guards were picked up and sent and enticed to go over to Iraq.
[00:20:39.908 --> 00:20:40.568]  It's insane!
[00:20:41.112 --> 00:20:46.495]  I mean, we should have more border guards and the only way you can afford it and get the personnel is to bring our troops home.
[00:20:46.895 --> 00:20:50.297]  We don't even have the money to finance this world empire that we operate under.
[00:20:50.837 --> 00:20:58.342]  We have to borrow almost $3 billion a day just to pay for the war and our extravagance.
[00:20:58.382 --> 00:21:01.063]  And we borrow it from none other than China and Japan.
[00:21:01.423 --> 00:21:04.485]  I mean, we don't even have enough wealth produced in this country to finance
[00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.612]  The amount of spending that we have.
[00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:10.095]  It will come to an end, and I think most Americans realize it.
[00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:13.838]  Middle class Americans and poor Americans have already suffered the consequences.
[00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:15.820]  Their standard of living has already started down.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.683]  Those who are doing well know deep down in their hearts they're doing it on borrowed money.
[00:21:20.103 --> 00:21:22.045]  And that is going to come to an end.
[00:21:22.345 --> 00:21:25.188]  It's also the reason I emphasize the importance of sound money.
[00:21:25.628 --> 00:21:28.771]  If you allow governments, any time throughout all of history,
[00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:32.393]  To print money, they always print too much and they destroy them.
[00:21:33.314 --> 00:21:37.958]  Our dollar is worth four cents of what it was when the Federal Reserve was created.
[00:21:38.518 --> 00:21:41.400]  Now those are all incredibly hardcore issues.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.724]  Did you know, and he's, Ron Paul's being conservative, that's a three-year-old number, it's now 1.5 cents.
[00:21:46.945 --> 00:21:58.734]  Okay, in the last, since 1913, when the private banks hijacked the government, took over the Federal Reserve, will set it up to take over the Treasury, they have debased it from one dollar, that amount translated into gold or silver.
[00:21:59.835 --> 00:22:02.276]  Folks, they have now debased it down to 1.5 cents.
[00:22:02.316 --> 00:22:03.937]  He's using old numbers, being conservative.
[00:22:04.837 --> 00:22:12.700]  And you tell the average yuppie that who thinks they know it all in a million dollar house, all borrowed, all leveraged, all show, they'll just laugh at you because they're trained to do that.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.621]  Because they've been generation after generation of not having to go through any hardship.
[00:22:19.019 --> 00:22:29.787]  Again, foreign corporations came in, they took over our government, they leveraged our wealth, literally set up high taxation to then transfer our wealth into international combines.
[00:22:30.768 --> 00:22:32.209]  And they're getting ready to pop the bubble.
[00:22:32.569 --> 00:22:36.412]  Now if we expose that they're behind it, they may have to back off popping the bubble.
[00:22:37.093 --> 00:22:38.994]  I'm literally, desperately trying to stop them.
[00:22:39.414 --> 00:22:40.255]  And we may be able to.
[00:22:40.999 --> 00:22:43.760]  Now when we get back, I'm going to get into the censorship of Ron Paul.
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.061]  And we even saw that right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:22:46.541 --> 00:22:47.982]  From the national, down to the local.
[00:22:48.542 --> 00:22:50.783]  As above, so below, as the new old order says.
[00:22:51.483 --> 00:22:51.944]  We'll be right back.
[00:23:01.665 --> 00:23:12.655]  JLS Research, the makers of all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[00:23:12.875 --> 00:23:19.380]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:27.187]  By using organics and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[00:23:27.427 --> 00:23:28.128]  As it responds,
[00:23:28.388 --> 00:23:30.410]  Body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.512]  First Responder is the first of its kind.
[00:23:32.633 --> 00:23:34.214]  Complies with only four organics.
[00:23:34.515 --> 00:23:37.778]  Grape seed skins, grape seed, grape fruit seed, and garlic.
[00:23:38.158 --> 00:23:42.623]  It's so effective, you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[00:23:42.943 --> 00:23:44.105]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[00:23:45.726 --> 00:23:49.207]  Go online and order First Responder at No-BO.com.

[00:24:00.988 --> 00:24:04.030]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:09.273]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:24:09.514 --> 00:24:13.876]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:24:14.177 --> 00:24:23.082]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:24:23.283 --> 00:24:26.905]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:24:27.185 --> 00:24:32.233]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:24:32.533 --> 00:24:39.223]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:24:39.733 --> 00:24:40.374]  What about you?
[00:24:41.034 --> 00:24:46.399]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:26:00.952 --> 00:26:02.114]  I'm Dr. Bill Diggle, M.D.
[00:26:02.234 --> 00:26:04.537]  of the Nutri-Medical Report here on Genesis.
[00:26:04.637 --> 00:26:07.640]  Allicin, natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.381]  is a real thing.
[00:26:08.461 --> 00:26:15.330]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:20.736]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:26:20.896 --> 00:26:21.637]  We're good to go!
[00:26:47.699 --> 00:26:51.663]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:55.946]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[00:26:56.487 --> 00:26:59.449]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:27:04.194 --> 00:27:06.596]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[00:27:06.656 --> 00:27:07.657]  Well, search no more.
[00:27:07.937 --> 00:27:10.199]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.622]  Raging for the truth.
[00:27:13.682 --> 00:27:14.843]  Exposing corruption.
[00:27:15.592 --> 00:27:19.015]  Dismantling the false left-right paradigm.
[00:27:19.075 --> 00:27:21.057]  He's Alex Jones.
[00:27:22.638 --> 00:27:26.702]  Thank you.
[00:27:26.782 --> 00:27:32.087]  Thank you, thank you very much.
[00:27:32.147 --> 00:27:34.589]  This is a bit overwhelming, believe me.
[00:27:34.649 --> 00:27:35.230]  Wonderful.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:56.868]  You know, a few months ago, excuse me, a few months ago, as a matter of fact, somebody this evening told me that last summer he suggested I do this, and I was very, very reluctant, and I hid it in no way that I was planning to do it, nor did I really want to do it.
[00:27:56.888 --> 00:28:00.851]  And a few months after that, then others came to me and they kept talking about it.
[00:28:01.711 --> 00:28:06.434]  And the truth, the truth is, is I have been very, very reluctant, and
[00:28:08.189 --> 00:28:12.653]  It wasn't that I was reluctant about our message, because I think our message is powerful.
[00:28:13.134 --> 00:28:26.887]  But I really wasn't sure whether I was the right person to do it, and eventually I said,
[00:28:27.495 --> 00:28:28.536]  Yes, I will.
[00:28:28.616 --> 00:28:32.158]  We'll see and we'll find out if there's anybody out there.
[00:28:32.218 --> 00:28:36.120]  I think of the people who believe in true freedom in the way I think of the remnant.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:44.244]  And evidently, you know, they say the remnant was out there and nobody could count them and they didn't know where they were and you can't find them.
[00:28:44.684 --> 00:28:47.246]  But the remnant will find you and find us.
[00:28:47.606 --> 00:28:51.028]  So it looks to me like the remnant is large and growing.
[00:28:58.121 --> 00:29:03.506]  Alright, that is Congressman Ron Paul last night from the Bob Bullock Texas History Museum.
[00:29:03.526 --> 00:29:04.287]  Really nice place.
[00:29:04.347 --> 00:29:07.470]  I go watch IMAX films next door there occasionally.
[00:29:08.511 --> 00:29:11.313]  And I want to go over some of the things that happened there last night.
[00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:15.897]  I was up until about 3 in the morning last night working on the video that you just heard the audio from.
[00:29:15.958 --> 00:29:20.662]  I didn't go to the event because frankly it would have been a major distraction.
[00:29:21.543 --> 00:29:27.167]  And I'm actually trying to get Ron Paul elected president, not there trying to do the opposite.
[00:29:27.508 --> 00:29:28.749]  That's why I was really honored.
[00:29:28.989 --> 00:29:33.973]  But that goes to you, the audience, when he was on about three weeks ago on my syndicated weekday show that we're doing.
[00:29:34.793 --> 00:29:37.395]  And he's out of the blue said, your show has been the greatest amount of support.
[00:29:37.815 --> 00:29:42.239]  It has been the majority of the support we've gotten all across the country, including donations.
[00:29:42.539 --> 00:29:45.481]  And that goes to you, listeners.
[00:29:45.921 --> 00:29:47.903]  Ron Paul on record with that hour-long interview.
[00:29:49.293 --> 00:30:04.749]  And so that's frankly why I didn't go because Ted Anderson that owns the Genesis Network that syndicates this show in association with MS Communications, he was so well known that everybody was coming up to him and that became a distraction.
[00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.854]  Some of the other talk show hosts of the network I'm affiliated with came down and it was really great.
[00:30:08.894 --> 00:30:10.636]  Ted was down here from Minnesota.
[00:30:11.465 --> 00:30:20.193]  I was shocked to learn, because I've been to other fundraisers there, and I've been to other events, and I've been at the museum right as they're starting fundraisers.
[00:30:20.273 --> 00:30:21.754]  It's a big place to have political events.
[00:30:22.015 --> 00:30:24.056]  You see the news cameras, you see the cameras in there.
[00:30:25.458 --> 00:30:31.123]  The museum told people, it's the state of Texas that owns it and runs it, but it was founded, a lot of it, with Enron money and other stuff.
[00:30:31.823 --> 00:30:36.828]  That, hey, you're not allowed to have any cameras here, you're not allowed to have media here.
[00:30:37.409 --> 00:30:42.771]  You're not allowed to... Kelby Jay can't come here and do a live broadcast from here with Kenny Romire.
[00:30:42.791 --> 00:30:45.252]  I think they ended up working something out.
[00:30:45.292 --> 00:30:46.492]  I know they did interview Ron Paul.
[00:30:46.712 --> 00:30:57.276]  Ron Paul had to do his press conference outside, and they were even telling the cameraman, because my cameraman was there, I didn't go, that don't show the state of Texas building, don't show the star, you're not allowed to videotape that.
[00:30:57.717 --> 00:31:01.458]  And the media was saying, but it's public, and they go, oh no, no, the state owns this.
[00:31:02.345 --> 00:31:07.707]  So, it was really Ron Paul was not treated very nicely by the folks that put that on.
[00:31:07.927 --> 00:31:09.767]  And listen, this isn't about petty stuff.
[00:31:09.787 --> 00:31:12.408]  We've got the borders wide open, the dollar imploding.
[00:31:14.008 --> 00:31:15.789]  I really wrestled with telling these stories.
[00:31:15.849 --> 00:31:16.509]  I'm going to leave it there.
[00:31:16.529 --> 00:31:17.589]  It gets a lot worse, folks.
[00:31:18.129 --> 00:31:19.170]  I'm going to leave it right there.
[00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.650]  Imagine a thousand people there.
[00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.250]  They sold close to 800 tickets.
[00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.271]  A couple hundred were guests.
[00:31:23.611 --> 00:31:26.932]  A thousand people for a fundraiser, $100 a plate.
[00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:38.218]  And the place is completely jam-packed with overflow, and Ron Paul, the most conservative voting record in Texas, is treated like dog meat.
[00:31:38.978 --> 00:31:41.761]  He's treated like crap by the state of Texas.
[00:31:42.221 --> 00:31:43.342]  Now, what do you expect?
[00:31:43.742 --> 00:31:52.470]  In fact, we had a Vote Rescue thing, an event there that I had reporters at, and they would come up and look at the press passes and go, get out, get out, get out.
[00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:54.231]  But wait, we signed up, we're pressed.
[00:31:54.391 --> 00:31:55.051]  Just get out!
[00:31:55.111 --> 00:31:55.932]  You're not allowed to be here!
[00:31:56.272 --> 00:31:58.053]  By the way, my cameraman was singled out.
[00:31:58.533 --> 00:31:59.834]  He had an InfoWars press pass.
[00:31:59.874 --> 00:32:00.894]  He was told, get out.
[00:32:01.735 --> 00:32:04.476]  By then, they capitulated and let me in, but not InfoWars.
[00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:09.059]  Hey, stupids, I had four people there, okay, under other passes.
[00:32:09.259 --> 00:32:11.140]  You're not gonna stop me if I want something.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.041]  Okay, so you didn't stop us.
[00:32:13.341 --> 00:32:14.201]  You didn't frustrate us.
[00:32:14.221 --> 00:32:15.322]  You got our decoy.
[00:32:16.022 --> 00:32:17.943]  Okay, and my guy was like, you really think you're gonna stop me?
[00:32:17.983 --> 00:32:19.004]  I go, you're InfoWars, brother.
[00:32:19.484 --> 00:32:20.324]  The state of Texas is.
[00:32:20.365 --> 00:32:21.245]  Wasn't Ron Paul's people.
[00:32:22.535 --> 00:32:37.481]  The reason I tell this story is because Yahoo, MySpace, MSNBC, all of them, at first, Newsweek's website, wouldn't show Ron Paul of the ten candidates in the last month.
[00:32:37.681 --> 00:32:39.942]  We had to give out phone numbers, have people lobby, call.
[00:32:41.189 --> 00:32:43.349]  Then y'all who tried to say he wasn't a real candidate.
[00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:45.850]  Then they had the MSNBC debate three weeks ago.
[00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.310]  Ron Paul won every poll.
[00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:51.631]  He won all of them by 80%, one of them by 94%.
[00:32:51.671 --> 00:32:53.031]  30-something thousand respondents, he had 94%.
[00:32:53.911 --> 00:32:56.272]  That was a IP address one vote.
[00:32:56.552 --> 00:32:57.932]  That is somewhat scientific.
[00:32:57.952 --> 00:32:59.632]  And they're gonna say, oh, people vote multiple times.
[00:32:59.932 --> 00:33:01.172]  No, it sees IP addresses.
[00:33:01.272 --> 00:33:02.653]  I tried to vote, to test it.
[00:33:02.893 --> 00:33:04.453]  You vote once, it says you've already voted.
[00:33:05.693 --> 00:33:07.633]  Not that I went to the office and voted, but that was separate.
[00:33:07.653 --> 00:33:10.554]  But the point is, is that it's an IP address situation.
[00:33:11.913 --> 00:33:12.933]  And so he won that.
[00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:15.534]  He's winning, he's winning, he's winning, he's winning.
[00:33:15.874 --> 00:33:18.695]  And then Fox News gets up and says, let's throw him off the debate.
[00:33:18.955 --> 00:33:23.136]  The head of GOPAC, the big Republican political action committee says, let's throw him off.
[00:33:23.396 --> 00:33:27.437]  Sean Hannity on Fox News that night said, I'm going to go vote against him.
[00:33:27.477 --> 00:33:28.418]  Everybody go vote against him.
[00:33:28.958 --> 00:33:29.698]  I have that on tape.
[00:33:31.148 --> 00:33:34.771]  Electioneering against Ron Paul, and then you see it right here locally.
[00:33:35.131 --> 00:33:37.332]  No, you can't have local radio stations.
[00:33:37.592 --> 00:33:40.314]  No, you can't have even local Fox Center, local KI.
[00:33:40.654 --> 00:33:42.836]  No, and of course, they kind of protested and got in.
[00:33:43.276 --> 00:33:44.237]  They made some phone calls.
[00:33:44.497 --> 00:33:52.762]  I learned about this yesterday morning, that, uh, because I called the head Ron Paul guy, local guy, and he said, yeah, man, uh, people sneak a camera, and they're telling us no cameras allowed.
[00:33:53.763 --> 00:33:54.784]  And I said, what do you mean?
[00:33:54.864 --> 00:33:56.625]  I go, I've been to events, they don't bar cameras.
[00:33:56.645 --> 00:33:57.365]  He goes, I know.
[00:33:57.906 --> 00:33:59.267]  I know, they've even barred KLBJ.
[00:34:01.224 --> 00:34:04.625]  See, that's the topic, because they're scared to death of Ron Paul.
[00:34:04.965 --> 00:34:08.446]  So, we have the entire 18-minute speech that Ron Paul gave.
[00:34:08.786 --> 00:34:09.586]  We're not going to air the whole thing.
[00:34:09.606 --> 00:34:10.387]  We're going to air a lot of it.
[00:34:10.727 --> 00:34:12.527]  And we're going to air it right here, coming up next hour.
[00:34:13.087 --> 00:34:13.428]  Okay?
[00:34:14.608 --> 00:34:22.510]  Also, the head of the museum staff was running around, making 9-11 troopers with 9-11 inside job, or investigating 9-11 shirts, take them off or they couldn't come in.
[00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:25.071]  See, that's like the
[00:34:28.524 --> 00:34:33.468]  The Capitol during the State of the Unions when Sidney Sheehan tried to wear a shirt with the number of dead.
[00:34:33.728 --> 00:34:37.471]  She took her jacket off, had it on, they arrested her, manhandled her, slammed her head in the ground.
[00:34:38.453 --> 00:34:41.334]  Of course, they had to apologize later because this is still America, okay?
[00:34:41.635 --> 00:34:43.435]  And see, it's this mentality everywhere.
[00:34:43.776 --> 00:34:45.116]  Oh, you can't wear that T-shirt.
[00:34:45.757 --> 00:34:48.358]  Oh, you can't wear a shirt saying the number of dead.
[00:34:48.378 --> 00:34:50.939]  Oh, you're in the shopping mall wearing a Peace on Earth shirt.
[00:34:50.979 --> 00:34:52.600]  We think it's an anti-war shirt.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:53.921]  We're going to arrest you.
[00:34:54.061 --> 00:34:56.182]  Oh, you can't go protest illegal aliens.
[00:34:56.562 --> 00:35:04.706]  I have video now, not just of somebody getting his face slammed in, but I've confirmed through the press that in Seattle on the May Day demonstrations by the illegal aliens wanting amnesty,
[00:35:05.797 --> 00:35:10.340]  That if you had a peaceful sign saying no to amnesty, you were arrested.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.742]  And if you argued, folks, the cops slammed your face in the concrete.
[00:35:14.963 --> 00:35:16.603]  I mean split foreheads, folks.
[00:35:16.844 --> 00:35:17.984]  I mean teeth loosened.
[00:35:18.184 --> 00:35:20.826]  We got video of blood jetting from faces.
[00:35:22.767 --> 00:35:25.249]  Just, hey, I'm allowed to protest as an American.
[00:35:25.689 --> 00:35:30.652]  Bam, boy, blood just pouring out of Americans' faces, you see.
[00:35:31.052 --> 00:35:32.433]  Oh, you can't have that 9-11 shirt.
[00:35:32.673 --> 00:35:34.274]  Oh, you can't protest illegal aliens.
[00:35:35.397 --> 00:35:38.399]  Oh, if you say global warming isn't real, it's like Holocaust denial.
[00:35:38.439 --> 00:35:39.159]  It needs to be illegal.
[00:35:39.379 --> 00:35:40.400]  Trying to pass laws right now.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:41.800]  You see?
[00:35:42.461 --> 00:35:45.122]  Now, I don't particularly like a lot of things Cindy Sheehan has to say.
[00:35:45.142 --> 00:35:47.403]  I'm against the war, but not for some of the reasons she is.
[00:35:47.423 --> 00:35:49.284]  I mean, I think she's way to the extreme left.
[00:35:49.324 --> 00:35:50.264]  I don't agree with a lot of stuff.
[00:35:50.284 --> 00:35:51.525]  You know, anti-gun, all that stuff.
[00:35:51.985 --> 00:35:52.985]  But still, I agree with her.
[00:35:53.086 --> 00:35:55.967]  Even if I disagree with her on the war, I'd be for her wearing that shirt.
[00:35:57.228 --> 00:35:58.108]  This is America!
[00:35:59.289 --> 00:36:03.450]  This is the United States, and if a Senator wanted to have her there as a guest, that's the Senator's guest.
[00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:04.510]  They're allowed to have two guests.
[00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.451]  And you have Republicans in there wearing shirts that were pro-war.
[00:36:07.731 --> 00:36:11.652]  Folks, if you lose, when you start losing that First Amendment, it's all over.
[00:36:12.172 --> 00:36:13.833]  So that's why I'm here to talk about this.
[00:36:14.033 --> 00:36:14.633]  And you know what?
[00:36:14.653 --> 00:36:16.213]  We're going to air his speech.
[00:36:16.973 --> 00:36:19.754]  You know how many tens of thousands of dollars it takes to rent that place?
[00:36:20.054 --> 00:36:26.636]  The state of Texas, you go put hard money down, a Congressman, his campaign goes in there, and he's treated like dirt.
[00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:30.760]  That's because they're scared to death of him.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.701]  That's why they're censoring him everywhere.
[00:36:32.901 --> 00:36:36.122]  That's why they censored PrisonPlanet.com and admit it.
[00:36:36.262 --> 00:36:40.403]  Rupert Murdoch admits it's censored off MySpace when he tried to send the bulletins.
[00:36:40.863 --> 00:36:44.085]  Because in Fox News' words, we're spreading virally.
[00:36:44.305 --> 00:36:45.585]  And that clip's coming up next.
[00:36:45.865 --> 00:36:46.825]  Then we'll take some calls.
[00:37:01.028 --> 00:37:05.072]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:37:05.272 --> 00:37:08.696]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:37:08.876 --> 00:37:12.380]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.903]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:37:16.023 --> 00:37:21.329]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we're seeing.
[00:37:21.749 --> 00:37:22.109]  I think so.
[00:37:38.414 --> 00:37:42.855]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:37:42.875 --> 00:37:44.296]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:37:44.456 --> 00:37:47.917]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:37:47.937 --> 00:37:49.197]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:38:02.407 --> 00:38:04.188]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:38:04.488 --> 00:38:07.330]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[00:38:07.831 --> 00:38:10.032]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[00:38:10.652 --> 00:38:18.938]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[00:38:19.418 --> 00:38:19.978]  An example?
[00:38:20.519 --> 00:38:23.360]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[00:38:24.221 --> 00:38:27.003]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[00:38:27.383 --> 00:38:30.625]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[00:38:31.405 --> 00:38:36.587]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[00:38:37.228 --> 00:38:38.708]  Money is not the problem.
[00:38:38.928 --> 00:38:39.929]  Availability is.
[00:38:40.449 --> 00:38:42.310]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:46.212]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[00:38:46.852 --> 00:38:48.933]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[00:38:48.953 --> 00:38:49.873]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:38:49.893 --> 00:38:49.933]  800-409-5633.

[00:39:12.136 --> 00:39:16.418]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.

[00:39:20.081 --> 00:39:23.523]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:39:23.843 --> 00:39:33.205]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:39:33.445 --> 00:39:36.966]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:39:37.206 --> 00:39:44.308]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:40:00.842 --> 00:40:05.483]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:40:05.523 --> 00:40:06.263]  have diabetes.
[00:40:06.583 --> 00:40:13.544]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:40:13.684 --> 00:40:18.205]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:40:18.405 --> 00:40:21.226]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:41:12.019 --> 00:41:15.061]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[00:41:15.862 --> 00:41:18.064]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[00:41:20.535 --> 00:41:21.116]  Welcome back.
[00:41:21.156 --> 00:41:25.019]  We are going to take your calls, maybe even in this segment, but definitely in the next hour.
[00:41:25.039 --> 00:41:29.562]  Toll free 877-590-5525, 877-590-5525, or 836-059 if you're listening to the station we broadcast out of here in Central Texas, NewsRadio 590, KLBJ.
[00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:43.093]  It's also a message board up on the KLBJ website, 590KLBJ.com.
[00:41:43.113 --> 00:41:44.314]  You want to go up there and post stuff.
[00:41:44.694 --> 00:41:47.036]  I may actually read some of those coming up in the next hour if I have time.
[00:41:47.416 --> 00:41:52.561]  Some of the other news, they've got mainstream news articles trying to deny that there's even a North American Union.
[00:41:53.041 --> 00:41:56.364]  So I thought I'd go over that and debunk their propaganda out of the St.
[00:41:56.384 --> 00:41:57.405]  Louis Post-Dispatch.
[00:41:58.397 --> 00:42:04.000]  Also, the new British Prime Minister, or soon-to-be new Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, calls for one world government, new world order.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.420]  We'll play an audio clip of that.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.721]  Hybrid embryos get go-ahead.
[00:42:07.741 --> 00:42:15.705]  This time with London Guardian as they legalize cross-species animal-human cross entities, creating new life forms.
[00:42:16.717 --> 00:42:19.238]  Also, Blair Tipp to be the new World Bank President.
[00:42:19.739 --> 00:42:21.479]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.940]  These people are complete puppets.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.221]  It doesn't matter who's in there.
[00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:25.181]  It's the system itself.
[00:42:25.722 --> 00:42:28.403]  Now, Mexican cops to come to the U.S.
[00:42:28.483 --> 00:42:29.543]  and be police officers.
[00:42:29.563 --> 00:42:32.025]  They want to start recruiting Mexican cops to police the American people.
[00:42:32.645 --> 00:42:39.928]  For those that haven't spent time in Mexico, folks, it's not uncommon to see a Mexican cop stumbling around with a whiskey bottle, shaking families down.
[00:42:39.948 --> 00:42:43.250]  I guess that's basically what's going to end up... I mean, I'm not kidding.
[00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:45.571]  I have been shook down by Mexican cops.
[00:42:46.232 --> 00:42:46.552]  I don't know.
[00:43:06.081 --> 00:43:10.986]  What do you think about the idea of having Mexican Tribs policing the United States, Associated Press?
[00:43:11.326 --> 00:43:11.767]  You like that?
[00:43:12.087 --> 00:43:13.989]  I think I'm going to get shut down quite a bit, probably.
[00:43:14.029 --> 00:43:14.489]  Well, hell!
[00:43:14.509 --> 00:43:16.331]  I mean, they're going to train our cops how to behave.
[00:43:16.692 --> 00:43:18.814]  Our cops are pretty close to that now, I guess, a lot of them.
[00:43:19.434 --> 00:43:21.717]  Actually, our police are wonderful compared to Mexican cops.
[00:43:22.077 --> 00:43:28.904]  You already see, I mean, Austin cops already bust out the whole riot gear just for, you know, just going down on 6th Street or something.
[00:43:28.924 --> 00:43:30.065]  I mean, every cop around here has
[00:43:30.735 --> 00:43:34.037]  A SWAT vest and a... Yeah, but that's one thing.
[00:43:34.077 --> 00:43:37.419]  I mean, militarization of police is bad, and it's federalization, and we all know that.
[00:43:37.479 --> 00:43:39.900]  But, I mean, folks, Mexican cops.
[00:43:40.361 --> 00:43:43.983]  I mean, down there, if you've got money, they just throw you in the jail and suck a hundred grand out of your family.
[00:43:44.223 --> 00:43:45.523]  I mean, I know people it's happened to.
[00:43:46.224 --> 00:43:47.685]  I mean, I'm... I mean, you're a Texan.
[00:43:47.705 --> 00:43:48.905]  You know how legendary the Mexicans are.
[00:43:48.925 --> 00:43:49.566]  Look at Dog.
[00:43:49.586 --> 00:43:51.267]  Yeah, the bounty hunter.
[00:43:51.287 --> 00:43:51.947]  They live in jail.
[00:43:52.728 --> 00:43:54.308]  They don't... I mean, they don't play games, folks.
[00:43:54.629 --> 00:43:58.691]  Santa Fe Police Department is trying to recruit Mexicans from Mexico to be their cops.
[00:44:00.746 --> 00:44:02.290]  And hell, the military is, why not?
[00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:03.713]  Why not be double slaves here?
[00:44:04.655 --> 00:44:08.483]  But getting back to Ron Paul, and I'm done talking about it until the next hour, and I'll play some of his speech.
[00:44:09.828 --> 00:44:11.269]  Just, they are scared to death of him.
[00:44:11.289 --> 00:44:13.530]  There is massive, concerted effort to censor him.
[00:44:14.031 --> 00:44:16.312]  And Thursday morning, we put this out, May 17th.
[00:44:16.392 --> 00:44:17.052]  It's now the 20th.
[00:44:17.512 --> 00:44:18.033]  Action alert!
[00:44:18.053 --> 00:44:19.133]  Keep Ron Paul in the debate.
[00:44:19.173 --> 00:44:20.314]  Neocon Republican elite.
[00:44:20.614 --> 00:44:21.274]  Seek the silence.
[00:44:21.415 --> 00:44:21.915]  Frontrunner.
[00:44:22.295 --> 00:44:24.636]  Sign the petition at thepetitiononline.com.
[00:44:24.656 --> 00:44:27.098]  Ron Paul forward slash petition dot html.
[00:44:27.678 --> 00:44:29.819]  Ours has gotten, I don't know, close to 15,000.
[00:44:29.919 --> 00:44:30.279]  I forget.
[00:44:30.299 --> 00:44:31.240]  I haven't looked at it in a while.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.142]  And there's a couple other petitions at over 10,000 apiece out there too.
[00:44:35.162 --> 00:44:35.682]  So 30,000 plus petitions.
[00:44:37.555 --> 00:44:40.438]  And then we did shut down the GOPAC and the RNC.
[00:44:41.539 --> 00:44:43.600]  They took the contact info off their websites.
[00:44:45.142 --> 00:44:45.802]  Do what, Trey?
[00:44:46.563 --> 00:44:47.724]  Nothing, that was a technical thing.
[00:44:47.744 --> 00:44:48.905]  Oh, I thought you were trying to talk to me.
[00:44:48.925 --> 00:44:50.066]  No, jump in any time you want.
[00:44:52.008 --> 00:44:52.948]  Trey wasn't talking to me on air.
[00:44:52.969 --> 00:44:53.809]  He was talking to his girlfriend.
[00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:54.610]  Actually, let me hit the button.
[00:44:55.391 --> 00:44:56.171]  Say hi to Amanda.
[00:44:56.211 --> 00:44:56.892]  I'm glad she's up here.
[00:44:57.072 --> 00:44:58.153]  She's volunteering.
[00:44:58.173 --> 00:44:59.334]  Talk about corporate downsizing.
[00:44:59.734 --> 00:45:01.436]  Volunteering to call screen up here.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:02.821]  So sweet of her.
[00:45:02.861 --> 00:45:04.002]  She is so nice and smart.
[00:45:04.502 --> 00:45:08.545]  Speaking of censorship, at her own newspaper... Uh-oh, she's hiding behind monitors.
[00:45:08.565 --> 00:45:09.686]  Yeah, she's getting nervous now, huh?
[00:45:09.746 --> 00:45:11.668]  At her own newspaper at the college!
[00:45:13.629 --> 00:45:17.913]  Well, I mean... Amanda, you want to come over on the mic and tell folks about it?
[00:45:17.933 --> 00:45:19.594]  Never mind, I'm not going to put you on the spot.
[00:45:20.475 --> 00:45:21.415]  Someday, if you want to do it.
[00:45:21.455 --> 00:45:22.156]  I'm just joking.
[00:45:22.776 --> 00:45:24.157]  Okay, she's in there screening calls.
[00:45:24.217 --> 00:45:26.599]  Yeah, she's using the call as an excuse.
[00:45:26.799 --> 00:45:30.923]  Alright, I'm really getting diverted now off topics here, but...
[00:45:32.603 --> 00:45:35.124]  That's just some of the news that is coming up.
[00:45:35.925 --> 00:45:37.205]  But right now, let me play this clip.
[00:45:37.225 --> 00:45:38.246]  Now, it's like six minutes long.
[00:45:38.266 --> 00:45:40.887]  I'm not going to play the whole thing as we analyze this propaganda.
[00:45:40.927 --> 00:45:43.308]  This is the fake neocon, the vampire albino.
[00:45:43.628 --> 00:45:44.628]  Nothing against albino folks.
[00:45:44.648 --> 00:45:45.669]  He's just a vampire albino.
[00:45:46.629 --> 00:45:52.172]  Up on Fox News with the Gibson's Big Story.
[00:45:52.717 --> 00:45:53.098]  I don't know.
[00:46:09.567 --> 00:46:12.010]  But worse than Ann Coulter.
[00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:13.511]  Again, fake conservatives.
[00:46:13.531 --> 00:46:14.832]  They're not real conservatives.
[00:46:14.852 --> 00:46:16.974]  They're there to give you clown-like analysis.
[00:46:17.335 --> 00:46:18.216]  Everything's funny.
[00:46:18.296 --> 00:46:19.397]  Laugh at the dumb liberals.
[00:46:20.057 --> 00:46:21.319]  No, I cry at the dumb liberals.
[00:46:21.339 --> 00:46:23.461]  And I cry at the dumb mainline conservatives.
[00:46:23.821 --> 00:46:25.062]  And they demonize Ron Paul.
[00:46:25.082 --> 00:46:26.023]  And they demonize me.
[00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:30.347]  And they say, oh, he should be barred from the debates because he goes on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:46:30.627 --> 00:46:31.068]  Here it is.
[00:46:31.768 --> 00:46:34.111]  And we're just going to play this from near the end.
[00:46:34.131 --> 00:46:34.411]  Go ahead.
[00:46:35.396 --> 00:46:51.859]  Ron Paul really has no business being on stage as a legitimate representative of Republicans because the 9-11 truth virus is something that infects only a very small proportion of people that would identify themselves as conservatives.
[00:46:53.139 --> 00:46:55.900]  Okay, that's just part of the clip.
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.140]  Just the danger of playing these things off YouTube.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.320]  Actually, I'll give you a CD.
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.241]  Let's play that whole thing.
[00:47:02.681 --> 00:47:04.061]  There's more to that clip, correct?
[00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:09.591]  If we have to, uh, we can, looks like a three alarm fire in there.
[00:47:10.131 --> 00:47:12.052]  If we have to, we can, uh, play it off us.
[00:47:12.092 --> 00:47:13.432]  I think I did bring a CD down here, didn't I?
[00:47:14.512 --> 00:47:15.112]  Uh, for that?
[00:47:15.473 --> 00:47:16.633]  Or maybe we'll play that later.
[00:47:17.213 --> 00:47:28.816]  Uh, then she goes on to say that this Ebo virus must be stopped and Ron Paul, Ron Paul, by the way, Ron Paul actually has talked about government sponsored terror on my show, the declassified ones.
[00:47:29.116 --> 00:47:31.076]  He says the government could stage attacks to get into Iran.
[00:47:31.297 --> 00:47:33.097]  He has not said 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:47:33.732 --> 00:47:35.353]  Okay, so this is a misrepresentation.
[00:47:35.573 --> 00:47:35.953]  Here it is.
[00:47:38.494 --> 00:47:38.614]  Huh.
[00:47:39.854 --> 00:47:41.295]  With the East German equipment in there.
[00:47:42.095 --> 00:47:44.436]  Liddy used to joke around and say that in there.
[00:47:44.656 --> 00:47:45.736]  Look, it's alright, guys.
[00:47:45.776 --> 00:47:47.056]  If it's not gonna work, we don't have to play it.
[00:47:47.457 --> 00:47:48.197]  It's up on the prism.
[00:47:50.077 --> 00:47:50.618]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:50.678 --> 00:47:51.638]  Oh, the computer locked up.
[00:47:51.678 --> 00:47:53.739]  That's... Well, we all know how computers are.
[00:47:54.719 --> 00:48:00.701]  My God, it's bad, though, when there's a computer virus in your... in your ventilator when you're on your deathbed, though.
[00:48:00.741 --> 00:48:00.981]  That would...
[00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:04.651]  That would be a really serious problem.
[00:48:04.892 --> 00:48:09.934]  But no, we are going to play that clip as soon as that works.
[00:48:10.914 --> 00:48:13.716]  But the good news here is we did have the action alert.
[00:48:13.796 --> 00:48:16.417]  We did get out the tens of thousands of signatures.
[00:48:16.517 --> 00:48:18.438]  We did get the tens of thousands of phone calls in.
[00:48:18.998 --> 00:48:22.360]  We even shut down some national talk shows that we targeted, like Hannity and others.
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:23.700]  In fact, we have audio.
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.281]  Those clips were call after caller.
[00:48:25.521 --> 00:48:27.962]  Called him out as a fake conservative, not a real conservative.
[00:48:30.243 --> 00:48:41.717]  And all of this dovetails in with a massive push for blanket amnesty that is coming up on Monday.
[00:48:42.483 --> 00:48:46.346]  Bush just announces on Wednesday, hey, we've come to an agreement.
[00:48:46.366 --> 00:48:58.475]  There's been months of secret negotiations, even if it's secret, between the leadership of the House and the Senate, and between the Republican and Democratic leadership of the Senate, and we're going to have the amnesty plan, but it's not an amnesty, but it's secret.
[00:48:58.635 --> 00:49:05.841]  In fact, it's over a thousand pages, and you can't read it, you can't see it, until
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:08.301]  Until it's already been voted on.
[00:49:08.702 --> 00:49:09.762]  Now, where did we see this before?
[00:49:10.163 --> 00:49:19.131]  With the Patriot Act, it was Ron Paul that blew the whistle on this, they didn't release it after the fact, they released it 25 minutes before to committee chairman.
[00:49:21.252 --> 00:49:28.058]  And then they rammed it through, and much of it had nothing to do with fighting terrorists, and everything to do with turning American people into terrorists, and claiming under Section 802 of H.R.
[00:49:28.078 --> 00:49:29.399]  3162, past October 27, 2001, and in the dead of night at 1230 in the morning.
[00:49:36.152 --> 00:49:49.530]  That reminds me of everything else that's going on where they tell us that we can't see and that we can't know what our government's doing on a hundred other issues.
[00:49:50.111 --> 00:49:51.433]  In fact, remember Cintra?
[00:49:52.276 --> 00:49:56.158]  The Spanish-owned company with 8,000 miles of toll roads on existing and new roads in Texas.
[00:49:56.559 --> 00:49:57.879]  Remember 2005 agreement?
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:10.067]  In 2006, last year, the Attorney General and others had to file suit back on Sentra, and they filed suit on the state, saying an agreement between a foreign company and an unelected bureaucracy, TxDOT, was secret!
[00:50:11.849 --> 00:50:13.990]  I mean, it's not just that it's secret from the Congress.
[00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.971]  You can't see the bill.
[00:50:15.231 --> 00:50:16.272]  Well, who's writing it then?
[00:50:16.612 --> 00:50:18.733]  It's not just that it's secret from the center of the American people.
[00:50:19.153 --> 00:50:21.095]  Now, toll road deals are secret.
[00:50:21.475 --> 00:50:25.417]  So last night, it was about 1230 at night, I was working on the Ron Paul clips and a film I'm making.
[00:50:25.717 --> 00:50:28.799]  I was working on a, you know, part of the documentary, Endgames, about the toll roads.
[00:50:29.079 --> 00:50:32.721]  So I just randomly typed in, I thought, I bet a toll road deals are secret in Texas.
[00:50:32.761 --> 00:50:33.722]  I bet they're secret everywhere.
[00:50:34.142 --> 00:50:35.323]  I just typed in, toll road
[00:50:36.255 --> 00:50:37.096]  Deal secret.
[00:50:37.536 --> 00:50:42.019]  And it was in Australia, and it was in Ohio, and it was in Texas, and it was in England.
[00:50:42.799 --> 00:50:49.644]  And they just come in and literally buy, not the legislatures now, they do something far worse.
[00:50:51.585 --> 00:50:59.530]  They come right in and they buy the agency.
[00:51:00.731 --> 00:51:00.991]  So
[00:51:02.424 --> 00:51:11.049]  Senators have had to pull a lot of strings just to get subsections of the bill on amnesty, and the American people aren't allowed to see it.
[00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:19.815]  Now, they're trying to pass this on Monday, and so we need to shut their phone lines down as well, congressionally.
[00:51:20.355 --> 00:51:24.637]  Now, I did try to call Thursday and Friday on this bill, and the phones are always busy.
[00:51:24.657 --> 00:51:26.899]  You can get through the switchboard, then you... I don't know.
[00:51:26.919 --> 00:51:28.340]  Give me Arlen Specter's office.
[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:30.701]  Give me Senator Hagel's office.
[00:51:30.721 --> 00:51:31.982]  Give me Senator Grassley's office.
[00:51:32.597 --> 00:51:34.038]  Give me Senator Boxer's office.
[00:51:34.919 --> 00:51:39.042]  And I don't just tell you to call, I call, and beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, it is busy.
[00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:48.410]  Alright, we will come back with a clip, thanks to computers, and we'll play that, then we'll take your calls, then we'll play part of Ron Paul's speech that our spies had to get out of.
[00:51:51.204 --> 00:51:52.265]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:51:52.365 --> 00:51:57.167]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds, reaching millions of listeners.
[00:51:57.287 --> 00:52:00.169]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:04.311]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[00:52:04.631 --> 00:52:10.655]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, national radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.
[00:52:10.835 --> 00:52:12.396]  Call me today at 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[00:52:12.436 --> 00:52:14.817]  For more information, that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[00:52:22.301 --> 00:52:23.361]  Looking for profit?
[00:52:23.401 --> 00:52:24.982]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:52:25.022 --> 00:52:28.123]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:52:28.363 --> 00:52:35.946]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:39.708]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:52:39.748 --> 00:52:41.288]  Secure your position today.
[00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:42.809]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:42.849 --> 00:52:43.089]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:50.985 --> 00:52:51.806]  Hello, folks!
[00:52:53.787 --> 00:52:59.851]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio experience like no other.
[00:52:59.871 --> 00:53:02.873]  Strap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:53:03.874 --> 00:53:05.194]  He stands for truth.
[00:53:06.615 --> 00:53:08.457]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:09.838 --> 00:53:11.379]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:11.779 --> 00:53:14.601]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:15.581 --> 00:53:18.403]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-
[00:53:19.952 --> 00:53:20.052]  590-5525.
[00:53:20.072 --> 00:53:24.681]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:53:31.014 --> 00:53:34.276]  All right, continual coverage of the big story this week.
[00:53:34.336 --> 00:53:39.438]  Ron Paul, hands down, winning the last two Republican presidential debates.
[00:53:39.938 --> 00:53:43.800]  Winning not just in the polls, but in the amount of media coverage and controversy.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:46.461]  Visited Austin last night for a big fundraiser.
[00:53:46.841 --> 00:53:48.322]  Around a thousand people showed up.
[00:53:48.582 --> 00:53:49.182]  Close to 800 tickets sold.
[00:53:49.202 --> 00:53:49.682]  Around 200 guests.
[00:53:51.543 --> 00:54:02.787]  I didn't go, I didn't want to become a distraction, but I did send my camera folks, and they did get an interview with Ron Paul, also asked him some questions during the press conference, and we got his speech, which hasn't been aired yet.
[00:54:03.188 --> 00:54:09.650]  We're going to air a large portion of his 18-minute speech that he gave, coming up near the end of the show in this hour.
[00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:16.993]  I know I haven't gotten your calls yet, because there's an unusual amount of news today, but I will get to Lee and Mark and others that have been holding
[00:54:17.333 --> 00:54:19.815]  Like real troopers here, most of you have dropped off.
[00:54:19.995 --> 00:54:20.535]  Here's the number.
[00:54:20.755 --> 00:54:23.957]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:54:23.977 --> 00:54:28.520]  877-590-KLBJ, 877-590-5525 or locally 836-0590.
[00:54:29.761 --> 00:54:30.701]  Did you go to the event?
[00:54:31.002 --> 00:54:31.942]  I mean, this is exciting.
[00:54:32.743 --> 00:54:36.265]  Normally I say, you know what, presidential elections are a distraction.
[00:54:36.305 --> 00:54:38.426]  Bob Dole vs. Bill Clinton, no real difference.
[00:54:39.047 --> 00:54:40.187]  Or even George Bush Sr.
[00:54:40.207 --> 00:54:41.748]  vs. Bill Clinton, they're both globalists.
[00:54:42.509 --> 00:54:44.550]  Or it was going to be Rudy Giuliani vs. Hillary.
[00:54:45.643 --> 00:54:46.423]  I'd say, who cares?
[00:54:46.643 --> 00:54:50.865]  Focus on governors and county commissioners and dog catchers.
[00:54:50.885 --> 00:54:52.465]  You know, the state level, the city, the county.
[00:54:52.505 --> 00:54:53.566]  That's where you can have a real effect.
[00:54:54.046 --> 00:54:54.646]  School board.
[00:54:55.166 --> 00:54:56.967]  That's where good people can still have an effect.
[00:54:56.987 --> 00:54:59.068]  At the presidential level, it's all bought and paid for.
[00:54:59.108 --> 00:55:04.869]  But Ron Paul has such a great history, so many people grassroots behind him, that he could get the Republican nomination.
[00:55:04.929 --> 00:55:06.390]  He could make Ross Perot look weak.
[00:55:07.169 --> 00:55:10.913]  He could come from nowhere, though, not as a third party, but as a Republican dark horse.
[00:55:11.413 --> 00:55:16.498]  He could be that wild card, and it's showing in every major poll now.
[00:55:16.879 --> 00:55:17.760]  This is history.
[00:55:18.948 --> 00:55:20.829]  We've got to give it our best shot.
[00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:28.935]  And it's just so exciting to see a real Republican, a real conservative, challenge the people that have hijacked the party and given it a bad name.
[00:55:29.215 --> 00:55:31.877]  And not just given the party a bad name, given America a bad name.
[00:55:32.158 --> 00:55:38.142]  We've gone, just in the last 10 years, because Bill Clinton was a big part of that too, for being one of the most loved countries in the world, being the most hated.
[00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:42.405]  I think only North Korea is ahead of us, is being seen as the world's greatest danger.
[00:55:43.777 --> 00:55:46.899]  And I don't like what's happening in our name, but there's a lot of twisting going on.
[00:55:46.959 --> 00:55:50.241]  Ron Paul, though I love him, hasn't said that 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:55:50.281 --> 00:55:54.104]  In fact, two years ago, he came out and said that he thought there wasn't evidence of that.
[00:55:54.224 --> 00:55:58.907]  Now, he's changed and said, yeah, there is some government-sponsored terror, and given historical examples.
[00:55:59.387 --> 00:56:08.574]  Gulf of Tonkin, Mozadek 53 in Iran, Ardennes in Cuba, excuse me, Ardennes with Guatemala in 54.
[00:56:10.375 --> 00:56:11.636]  He's talked about that on my show.
[00:56:12.196 --> 00:56:13.057]  He's talked about it right here.
[00:56:14.415 --> 00:56:15.916]  He has not said it's an inside job.
[00:56:15.936 --> 00:56:24.504]  He was saying what the CIA's reports, Whitewash reports, what the 9-11 Commission report said, that the military occupation clearly has stimulated terrorist attacks.
[00:56:24.964 --> 00:56:27.686]  And clearly there are some real terrorists, and it does stimulate that.
[00:56:27.987 --> 00:56:37.335]  The Pentagon's own plan, P-2-O-G says, we're going to go over there, attack them, make them stimulate attacks, quote, as a way to expand the war, as a pretext to stay in the Middle East.
[00:56:37.355 --> 00:56:39.657]  I mean, that's a pro-neocon paper.
[00:56:40.722 --> 00:56:45.906]  And it's six plus billion in federal funding every year in the Pentagon to carry out Operation P-2-O-G.
[00:56:45.946 --> 00:56:47.087]  Google it.
[00:56:47.107 --> 00:56:47.627]  P-2-O-G.
[00:56:48.528 --> 00:56:50.089]  So they come out and they lie about him.
[00:56:50.189 --> 00:56:53.171]  And it blew up in their face and their attempt to set him up blew up.
[00:56:53.211 --> 00:56:55.533]  But here is the clip that was misfiring earlier.
[00:56:55.893 --> 00:56:57.835]  We're going back to the old analog here with the CD.
[00:56:58.775 --> 00:57:04.540]  Just the last few minutes, a few days ago, of them trying to demonize him with John Gibson or whatever his name is on Fox television.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:04.800]  Here it is.
[00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:23.579]  Ron Paul really has no business being on stage as a legitimate representative of Republicans, because the 9-11 truth virus is something that infects only a very small proportion of people that would identify themselves as conservative or Republican.
[00:57:23.659 --> 00:57:27.061]  And as you say, John, this is far more prevalent, this
[00:57:27.261 --> 00:57:27.481]  Why?
[00:57:27.501 --> 00:57:32.708]  Why did 35% of Democrats believe it and I think it's another 26% haven't quite made up their mind about it?
[00:57:45.689 --> 00:57:51.113]  Well, I think part of it is what Charles Krauthammer has famously called Bush Derangement Syndrome.
[00:57:51.433 --> 00:57:54.175]  I think that pathology has taken hold.
[00:57:54.196 --> 00:57:55.216]  Alright, hit pause.
[00:57:55.236 --> 00:57:56.637]  We're going to continue in a minute.
[00:57:57.118 --> 00:57:58.619]  Notice, they always try to make it left-right.
[00:57:58.799 --> 00:57:59.820]  Oh, it's the leftist.
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:02.882]  Oh, it's those crazy... No, actually, it's the left.
[00:58:03.302 --> 00:58:07.145]  The Nation Magazine and Democracy Now!
[00:58:07.265 --> 00:58:10.308]  and the London Guardian that has attacked myself, Rolling Stone.
[00:58:11.148 --> 00:58:14.851]  The left is virulently against 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:58:15.743 --> 00:58:16.903]  Okay, they love the government.
[00:58:16.923 --> 00:58:17.903]  The government's their savior.
[00:58:18.724 --> 00:58:20.284]  I mean, remember Bill Clinton using terror.
[00:58:20.344 --> 00:58:21.544]  Clearly involved in the O.K.C.
[00:58:21.584 --> 00:58:21.884]  bombing.
[00:58:22.104 --> 00:58:23.265]  Don't forget that, conservatives.
[00:58:23.585 --> 00:58:26.425]  Most conservatives, when polled, believe that Clinton was behind that, and you're right.
[00:58:26.705 --> 00:58:29.726]  But when Bush is in power and it happens, oh, it's impossible.
[00:58:30.366 --> 00:58:31.566]  Bush is a complete puppet.
[00:58:31.586 --> 00:58:36.567]  I'm not saying Bush carried out the attacks, but the military, big pharma, media complex.
[00:58:37.187 --> 00:58:38.488]  The farm banks that are in our country.
[00:58:38.508 --> 00:58:39.828]  Look at the shareholders of these companies.
[00:58:40.288 --> 00:58:41.268]  They're the ones that did this.
[00:58:41.308 --> 00:58:45.509]  They wrote white paper saying, we need terror attacks to be able to get our empire going.
[00:58:46.132 --> 00:58:48.733]  They said we need to stage terror attacks.
[00:58:50.213 --> 00:58:51.133]  We have official U.S.
[00:58:51.153 --> 00:58:52.474]  government plans to do it.
[00:58:52.514 --> 00:58:53.374]  Declassify it.
[00:58:53.394 --> 00:58:56.535]  I mean, hijacking jets by remote control and flying them into things.
[00:58:57.195 --> 00:58:57.975]  Bombing D.C.
[00:58:57.995 --> 00:58:59.095]  Committing sniper attacks.
[00:58:59.495 --> 00:59:00.976]  Committing staged mass shootings.
[00:59:01.976 --> 00:59:03.016]  That's all in Northwoods.
[00:59:03.056 --> 00:59:03.456]  Google it.
[00:59:03.516 --> 00:59:04.977]  ABC News Baltimore Sun.
[00:59:05.417 --> 00:59:06.617]  But that was out in 2000.
[00:59:08.017 --> 00:59:10.278]  Alright folks, and there's a bunch of admitted cases of this.
[00:59:11.377 --> 00:59:12.818]  And so they always make it about the left.
[00:59:12.998 --> 00:59:14.058]  Oh, the left, the left.
[00:59:14.098 --> 00:59:24.842]  Hey, uh, Malkin, Fox News contributor, Ron Paul and Alex Jones and other real conservatives, paleoconservatives, we're not consulting for Hillary's campaign like News Corp.
[00:59:25.262 --> 00:59:28.963]  We're not having fundraisers for her where she raises 25 mil at a pop.
[00:59:30.104 --> 00:59:30.824]  So shut up!
[00:59:32.092 --> 00:59:35.676]  Bill Clinton was just hanging out at a steakhouse having dinner with Rush Limbaugh.
[00:59:35.957 --> 00:59:36.798]  I've had enough of it.
[00:59:37.058 --> 00:59:40.161]  I don't vacation with Bill Clinton like Bush Sr.
[00:59:40.362 --> 00:59:43.485]  I don't call him a surrogate son like Barbara Bush does.
[00:59:44.606 --> 00:59:44.947]  Okay?
[00:59:44.987 --> 00:59:46.328]  It's staged, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:46.709 --> 00:59:47.770]  And I'm not part of that.
[00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:51.872]  I'm not the one tripling the size of the BATF like Bush did.
[00:59:52.293 --> 00:59:58.417]  As NRA board member, Congressman Bob Barr, said on my show a few months ago that Bush has been more anti-gun than Clinton.
[00:59:58.697 --> 01:00:01.279]  You just haven't known about it because they've had a cloaking device.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:02.700]  It's called camouflage.
[01:00:02.901 --> 01:00:03.681]  Have you figured out?
[01:00:04.061 --> 01:00:06.643]  The New World Order poses as liberals and conservatives.
[01:00:06.863 --> 01:00:07.644]  They're globalists.
[01:00:07.864 --> 01:00:08.805]  They must be stopped.
[01:00:09.265 --> 01:00:10.406]  Finish up the clip, please.
[01:00:10.806 --> 01:00:12.187]  Quickly, before we go to break.
[01:00:12.207 --> 01:00:13.048]  Let's finish the clip.
[01:00:14.165 --> 01:00:22.675]  Why did 35% of Democrats believe it and I think it's another 26% haven't quite made up their mind about it?
[01:00:23.443 --> 01:00:28.848]  Well, I think part of it is what Charles Krauthammer has famously called Bush Derangement Syndrome.
[01:00:29.188 --> 01:00:37.174]  I think that pathology has taken hold among many Democrats who would consider themselves mainstream.
[01:00:37.574 --> 01:00:47.642]  So anything that they could do to suspect or blame him for America's problems, and particularly the terrorist attack, they're willing to believe.
[01:00:47.662 --> 01:00:50.645]  I think a lot of it is just plain ignorance.
[01:00:51.185 --> 01:01:05.276]  And then there's the paranoid strain on the left, I talked about this in my book Unhinged, of tinfoil hat wearers who indulge in this kind of fantasy where America bears the blame for global jihad.
[01:01:06.237 --> 01:01:10.721]  You know, Michelle, Rosie talks about this stuff all the time on The View.
[01:01:11.790 --> 01:01:15.336]  And the view has a large audience.
[01:01:16.117 --> 01:01:26.032]  Would this notion be as prevalent as it is if there weren't prominent people like Rosie, Charlie Sheen and others constantly talking it up?
[01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:30.379]  Well, they certainly do bear blame for mainstreaming it.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:35.525]  Rosie O'Donnell and Alec Baldwin and Charlie Sheen, I believe.
[01:01:36.366 --> 01:01:44.894]  But it's there on the internet and these people are absolutely rabid and they are impervious to reason or logic.
[01:01:45.715 --> 01:01:51.297]  It's great that we have magazines, publications like Popular Mechanics that are out there slogging every day.
[01:01:51.578 --> 01:01:57.100]  There are a lot of blogs as well that have been debunking a lot of these 9-11 conspiracy theories.
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:09.665]  This war is going on on places like YouTube and in social networking places, but I think it's incumbent on mainstream news outlets to debunk these people, and I don't think you see nearly enough of that outside of Fox News.
[01:02:09.685 --> 01:02:11.766]  Part of this 9-11 Truth Movement says
[01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:14.667]  When we get back, we'll finish the last little part of this.
[01:02:14.707 --> 01:02:20.488]  We were playing more than a clip and I intended, but uh... When we get back, we'll finish up where they attacked me and Ron Paul.
[01:02:20.508 --> 01:02:22.828]  And then we'll go to your calls, I promise.
[01:02:23.068 --> 01:02:23.388]  Okay?
[01:02:23.468 --> 01:02:24.449]  At 877-595-525-8360 or 590 locally.
[01:02:24.529 --> 01:02:26.569]  And we'll continue.
[01:02:26.649 --> 01:02:30.730]  And then we're going to play some of the speech from last night.
[01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:32.730]  Ron Paul, here in Austin, Texas.
[01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:34.751]  The website's hotprisonplanet.com.
[01:02:34.771 --> 01:02:39.052]  You can watch the speech he gave on my website and the press conference on hotprisonplanet.com.
[01:02:39.112 --> 01:02:40.312]  Right now, we'll be right back.
[01:02:42.213 --> 01:02:56.322]  It's here.
[01:02:56.523 --> 01:03:01.326]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:01.686 --> 01:03:09.331]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:03:10.006 --> 01:03:17.071]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:03:17.452 --> 01:03:20.334]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:03:20.774 --> 01:03:23.116]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:03:23.516 --> 01:03:24.317]  NSA spy.
[01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:28.956]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:03:29.176 --> 01:03:32.697]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:03:33.157 --> 01:03:35.118]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:03:35.418 --> 01:03:39.319]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:29.425 --> 01:04:40.947]  The Ron Paul for President Rally and Fundraiser will be at the Texas History Museum in Austin, Texas at Congress and MLK on Saturday, May 19th from 6.30 till 10 p.m.
[01:04:41.147 --> 01:04:43.408]  For ticket or donation info, call 512-250-8649.

[01:05:53.931 --> 01:05:55.712]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:05:56.012 --> 01:05:58.853]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[01:05:59.353 --> 01:06:01.574]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[01:06:02.175 --> 01:06:10.458]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[01:06:10.958 --> 01:06:11.518]  An example?
[01:06:12.039 --> 01:06:14.880]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:18.521]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[01:06:18.902 --> 01:06:22.163]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[01:06:22.938 --> 01:06:28.140]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.241]  Money is not the problem.
[01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:31.462]  Availability is.
[01:06:31.982 --> 01:06:33.843]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[01:06:34.083 --> 01:06:37.764]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[01:06:38.384 --> 01:06:40.465]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[01:06:40.525 --> 01:06:41.526]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:41.546 --> 01:06:41.586]  800-409-5633.
[01:06:53.004 --> 01:06:57.908]  News, politics, sports, cars, home improvement, health, and everything in between.
[01:06:57.948 --> 01:06:59.129]  We've got you covered.
[01:06:59.209 --> 01:07:02.432]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:04.494 --> 01:07:06.976]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:07:09.698 --> 01:07:10.719]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:07:11.388 --> 01:07:14.189]  And I don't think you've seen nearly enough of that outside of Fox News.
[01:07:14.209 --> 01:07:22.152]  Part of this 9-11 truth movement says that the United States attacked the Pentagon with missiles and a plane did not hit it.
[01:07:22.692 --> 01:07:32.955]  I have never been able to understand how the 9-11 truthers then explain where is American Flight 77 and where are all those people?
[01:07:33.255 --> 01:07:35.156]  Have you ever heard them try to explain that?
[01:07:36.361 --> 01:07:54.534]  You know, I try not to spend too much time in these cesspools, but it is worth taking a visit to places like, you know, these WTC7 sites and Students and Scholars for Truth, and I note that Ron Paul has basically allied himself with these people.
[01:07:54.574 --> 01:08:00.659]  He appears with Students for Truth on campus, and he's appeared on radio shows like 9-11 Conspiracy Nut,
[01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:01.960]  Alex Jones.
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:07.985]  And I would hope that that would disqualify him the next time around from appearing on stage with other Republicans.
[01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:12.249]  We shall see Fox News contributor and syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin.
[01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:14.030]  Be sure to check out MichelleMalkin.com.
[01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:14.931]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:26.201]  Be sure and go hear a funny conservative that's there to neutralize you and ensure that we don't actually save the country and that we just blindly believe that it's really a fight between Republicans and Democrats up there.
[01:08:26.221 --> 01:08:27.502]  Let me give you a little news flash.
[01:08:28.306 --> 01:08:33.290]  It's a military-industrial complex, as the head of the Naval War College says, that works for foreign corporations.
[01:08:33.791 --> 01:08:40.716]  I've seen presentations on C-SPAN with the head of the Naval War College, or top futurist, admitting they work for, quote, New World Order.
[01:08:41.737 --> 01:08:43.959]  Okay, and I'm not saying our average troops are bad.
[01:08:44.459 --> 01:08:47.042]  I'm saying the system is being taken over.
[01:08:47.402 --> 01:08:48.603]  It's been taken over.
[01:08:49.771 --> 01:08:53.613]  And, by the way, Popular Mechanics is the name of yellow journalism, literally.
[01:08:53.813 --> 01:08:58.555]  You know the joke where they say in the dictionary next to the word ugly, there's a picture of you?
[01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:05.698]  Well, in the dictionary, literally, in the encyclopedia next to the word yellow journalism, it says Hirsch Publishing Popular Mechanics.
[01:09:06.958 --> 01:09:18.623]  And, by the way, Michael Chertoff's family wrote the piece, his cousin wrote it and admitted it, and it all got blown open, and they lied about a bunch of stuff, or they found kooks out there in the movement and debunked what they said, or they lied and said other things.
[01:09:19.702 --> 01:09:21.323]  And now they've been debunked completely.
[01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:23.445]  But again, they know the average.
[01:09:23.465 --> 01:09:33.793]  I mean, I've got a major newspaper here saying there's no such thing as a North American Union when I have the four-year documents released from the SPP meetings saying it's a North American Union.
[01:09:35.676 --> 01:09:36.616]  They just lie!
[01:09:36.816 --> 01:09:41.138]  It's like they say this is an amnesty, and now leaked sections of the bill.
[01:09:41.298 --> 01:09:44.838]  Now, there's old versions out there, but the new bill, AP reporting it secret.
[01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:48.539]  They're gonna supposedly vote on it Monday, and they're just saying it doesn't exist.
[01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:49.160]  Let's go to calls.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:50.940]  Lee, Mark, Jack, Rodney, and others.
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.021]  Let's go ahead and go to Lee.
[01:09:53.061 --> 01:09:53.561]  You're on the air.
[01:09:53.641 --> 01:09:54.281]  Thanks for holding.
[01:09:54.361 --> 01:09:54.661]  Welcome.
[01:09:55.661 --> 01:09:56.001]  Hey, Alex.
[01:09:56.021 --> 01:09:56.482]  How you doing?
[01:09:56.502 --> 01:09:57.182]  Thanks for calling.
[01:09:57.222 --> 01:09:57.722]  Thanks for holding.
[01:09:57.742 --> 01:09:58.222]  What's on your mind?
[01:09:58.737 --> 01:10:05.122]  Now the reason why I called is because I came across this directive released by the White House called the National Security Homeland Security President's Directive.
[01:10:05.222 --> 01:10:07.865]  It's NSPD 51, HSPD 20.
[01:10:08.946 --> 01:10:12.869]  And essentially what this thing does, from my analysis of it, it looks like
[01:10:13.493 --> 01:10:30.747]  Yeah, it's total martial law, and then Bush enacted that last year with the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, literally openly funding and setting up martial law and saying he's above the governors, the legislatures, even the state guards.
[01:10:31.167 --> 01:10:43.405]  And then with the Military Commissions Act, it's torture and secret arrest and strippage of citizenship from citizens in secret and torture until death under the Gonzales and John Yu memos.
[01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:46.169]  And then if you elaborate and expand,
[01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:56.658]  Under PDD-60, the Clinton sign that Bush forwarded and continued, we will also accept the first nuclear strike before even retaliating, which will mean we're totally wide open.
[01:10:56.699 --> 01:11:03.804]  So, the borders are open, we're open to nuke attack, but PDD-51 and PDD-25 are in force for martial law.
[01:11:04.645 --> 01:11:06.126]  Well, actually, this is a new directive.
[01:11:06.146 --> 01:11:07.427]  This was released May 9, 2007.
[01:11:08.028 --> 01:11:09.990]  Well, then they've reissued it, sir.
[01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:10.570]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:11.711]  They continually reissue.
[01:11:11.991 --> 01:11:13.913]  Sometimes every four years, sometimes every year.
[01:11:15.143 --> 01:11:15.844]  That's scary.
[01:11:16.925 --> 01:11:20.768]  I did my analysis on it, and it got around 4,000 digs on dig.com.
[01:11:20.828 --> 01:11:22.469]  Well, do me a favor, send that over.
[01:11:22.589 --> 01:11:23.110]  Good job.
[01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:25.652]  Yeah, that's hundreds of times bigger than the Drudge Report.
[01:11:26.393 --> 01:11:39.183]  Send that over, for those that don't know what dig is, send that over to Aaron at InfoWars.com, two As, Ryan at InfoWars.com, Watson at PrisonPlanet.com, and we'll make sure that your story gets up.
[01:11:39.864 --> 01:11:40.344]  Sounds good.
[01:11:40.465 --> 01:11:40.805]  Thank you.
[01:11:40.885 --> 01:11:41.385]  God bless you.
[01:11:41.445 --> 01:11:42.987]  Now, I'm fully aware of PDD.
[01:11:44.712 --> 01:11:46.373]  I've been a long time listener.
[01:11:46.433 --> 01:11:49.695]  I've watched a lot of your documentaries and you do an amazing job.
[01:12:01.886 --> 01:12:02.826]  I really appreciate it.
[01:12:17.338 --> 01:12:23.280]  I mean, why go off what Chavez says?
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:30.962]  The head of Latin American military task force, number two to the drug czar, was caught shipping in masses of cocaine and heroin.
[01:12:31.522 --> 01:12:32.682]  They're constantly catching them.
[01:12:32.763 --> 01:12:38.044]  I've probably interviewed 20 top or more CIA officers who were there loading the cocaine and heroin.
[01:12:38.484 --> 01:12:40.825]  Well, Bill Clinton was there and Bush's were driving around.
[01:12:41.145 --> 01:12:42.086]  This is just in MENA.
[01:12:42.926 --> 01:12:44.287]  Best-selling books have been written.
[01:12:44.567 --> 01:12:46.948]  Esquire Magazine, DEA, BUS, C-130s.
[01:12:47.268 --> 01:12:48.089]  It's U.S.
[01:12:48.109 --> 01:12:51.391]  troops with CIA backing unloading it.
[01:12:53.031 --> 01:12:54.632]  Our government ships in over half of it.
[01:12:54.872 --> 01:12:56.573]  The rest of it's certified cartels.
[01:12:56.793 --> 01:13:04.137]  They have GPS-controlled planes that spray by GPS one field in Colombia or Nicaragua or El Salvador or Guatemala.
[01:13:04.497 --> 01:13:06.159]  We're good to go.
[01:13:24.074 --> 01:13:38.065]  And then on the other side, they're pushing legal drugs whose molecular makeup is even more toxic than naturally occurring different types of narcotics and opiates, like the serotonin reuptake inhibitors that are in the hallucinogenic category.
[01:13:38.445 --> 01:13:39.346]  Yeah.
[01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:46.132]  One other thing I wanted to mention, I urge all your listeners to look this up on the internet.
[01:13:46.192 --> 01:13:52.817]  I don't think it really, overall, there's not really a lot of attention paid to this because it's kind of, it's not like a huge issue to a lot of people.
[01:13:53.607 --> 01:14:00.813]  Go ahead and look up the Intellectual Property Protection Act of 2007 that Alberto Gonzalez helped push through.
[01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:08.540]  Yeah, it says if you think about infringing on a copyright ten years in prison and what is it, a half million dollar fine?
[01:14:09.541 --> 01:14:10.722]  I'm not sure.
[01:14:10.762 --> 01:14:11.742]  I read that a few days ago.
[01:14:11.782 --> 01:14:12.663]  I read the actual bill.
[01:14:12.703 --> 01:14:14.104]  I'm going from memory on that, yeah.
[01:14:14.185 --> 01:14:18.148]  Oh yeah, if you attempt to commit copyright infringement, it's now a felony.
[01:14:19.248 --> 01:14:21.409]  And then he's downloading music, and I appreciate your call.
[01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:22.690]  But they're not going to get away with that.
[01:14:22.730 --> 01:14:26.712]  Listen, the new economy isn't building cars and computers and happy families.
[01:14:26.772 --> 01:14:33.255]  It's prisons everywhere, mindless brainwashed cops with tattoos all over them, with shaved heads, wearing body armor, okay?
[01:14:33.475 --> 01:14:34.776]  With Mexican fibs running around.
[01:14:34.956 --> 01:14:38.878]  By the way, I have Boston Globe, Christian Science Monitor, and AP.
[01:14:39.118 --> 01:14:43.460]  They're hiring and going to hire Mexicans to be our police now, okay?
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.140]  And our military.
[01:14:44.461 --> 01:14:45.221]  It's already been happening.
[01:14:45.621 --> 01:14:49.142]  Okay, I mean, I'm telling you folks, we're so far gone, you can't even begin to imagine it.
[01:14:49.602 --> 01:14:51.023]  But you keep saying it can't happen here.
[01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:53.223]  Rodney, in Texas.
[01:14:53.283 --> 01:14:54.344]  Go ahead, you're on the air, sir.
[01:14:54.504 --> 01:14:54.884]  In Austin.
[01:14:54.904 --> 01:15:01.726]  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you a couple of things that I heard in that little excerpt that you played from Michelle Malkin.
[01:15:02.546 --> 01:15:03.646]  You know, she keeps... The liberal?
[01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:04.126]  Yes.
[01:15:04.526 --> 01:15:06.487]  Yeah, she keeps using the word debunk.
[01:15:06.567 --> 01:15:08.007]  Well, to me, that's just cold.
[01:15:08.548 --> 01:15:13.309]  We want to censor their First Amendment rights so that they can't make any kind of reply
[01:15:14.244 --> 01:15:17.827]  To all the evidence that you... That's right, it's buzzwords!
[01:15:18.288 --> 01:15:21.931]  Who cares if Lawrence Livermore Laboratory says the bullet, that a single bullet's impossible?
[01:15:22.191 --> 01:15:24.293]  Who cares if top FBI labs say it?
[01:15:24.574 --> 01:15:26.555]  Who cares if all the facts and eyewitnesses say it?
[01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:28.918]  We'll just say it's a grassy knoll.
[01:15:28.938 --> 01:15:30.019]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:15:30.039 --> 01:15:33.082]  I'm going to come back to you, Rodney, in the next segment.
[01:15:33.102 --> 01:15:34.583]  I'm going to take three or four more calls.
[01:15:34.983 --> 01:15:39.808]  Then I've got to hit all the drills they're doing, putting guns to kids' heads, unannounced, and brainwashing them.
[01:15:40.328 --> 01:15:41.810]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:44.353]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[01:16:00.629 --> 01:16:01.751]  For a while anyway.
[01:16:02.272 --> 01:16:05.457]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[01:16:06.077 --> 01:16:08.401]  Listen, haven't you heard about Cal-X ointment?
[01:16:08.701 --> 01:16:12.207]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:14.711]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:16.083]  What's the name again?
[01:16:16.443 --> 01:16:17.444]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:16:17.824 --> 01:16:18.665]  It's Calex.
[01:16:18.945 --> 01:16:20.726]  C-A-L-E-X.
[01:16:21.527 --> 01:16:23.188]  What makes Calex ointment so different?
[01:16:23.408 --> 01:16:31.694]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:16:32.739 --> 01:16:37.302]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use Enzyme-Rich Moisturizing Cal-X Ointment.
[01:16:37.522 --> 01:16:46.627]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B Grocery Stores, Medicine Shop Pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:16:47.347 --> 01:16:48.448]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[01:16:48.508 --> 01:16:49.168]  I'll be right back.
[01:16:49.428 --> 01:16:50.349]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[01:16:53.229 --> 01:16:58.453]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:16:58.593 --> 01:17:06.700]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:15.447]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident, radioactive poisoning.
[01:17:15.947 --> 01:17:21.430]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:26.713]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:17:26.833 --> 01:17:35.718]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:17:35.978 --> 01:17:40.741]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium

[01:17:52.774 --> 01:17:54.495]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:17:54.715 --> 01:17:58.418]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:17:58.738 --> 01:18:00.959]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:07.684]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:18:07.844 --> 01:18:12.747]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:18:12.947 --> 01:18:21.893]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[01:18:22.273 --> 01:18:28.276]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[01:18:54.289 --> 01:18:58.412]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:18:58.653 --> 01:19:00.414]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:19:00.674 --> 01:19:06.959]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:19:07.239 --> 01:19:13.384]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:19:13.625 --> 01:19:15.466]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument.
[01:19:15.726 --> 01:19:16.086]  I think so.
[01:19:38.112 --> 01:19:40.735]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:20:03.991 --> 01:20:06.313]  Coming to you from the capital of Texas.
[01:20:06.933 --> 01:20:10.315]  Broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide.
[01:20:10.836 --> 01:20:13.117]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:16.359 --> 01:20:19.201]  Yeah, I just typed in Presidential Directive 51.
[01:20:19.421 --> 01:20:21.302]  I'm on the whitehouse.gov.
[01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:24.284]  National Security Homeland Security Presidential Directive.
[01:20:24.644 --> 01:20:25.685]  This happened a few weeks ago.
[01:20:25.725 --> 01:20:28.326]  It really did just re-authorize things that happened in the past.
[01:20:28.847 --> 01:20:30.928]  But it expanded it for the shadow government.
[01:20:31.368 --> 01:20:32.249]  The Washington Post
[01:20:33.761 --> 01:20:36.643]  Even reported that it was the setup of the shadow government.
[01:20:37.143 --> 01:20:44.107]  Hope you all feel safe, because in this new shadow government, foreign groups are a big part of your new freedom.
[01:20:47.169 --> 01:20:47.709]  Oh boy.
[01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:54.053]  Let's go back to Rodney in Austin, Texas.
[01:20:54.113 --> 01:20:55.554]  Go ahead Rodney, finish up what you were saying.
[01:20:56.147 --> 01:21:01.332]  Yeah, I was also going to add just two more brief auxiliary pieces of information.
[01:21:01.612 --> 01:21:12.202]  Lindsey Graham, at the top of the news hour, was booed yesterday at one of his, well anyway, he was booed by his constituency.
[01:21:12.683 --> 01:21:17.948]  And today, instead of being sensitive to his constituency, he says, I'm going to fight them
[01:21:18.863 --> 01:21:27.570]  Yeah, I mean, all over the country, foreign toll companies come in literally by the legislatures, but then the legislature fights it and they go, look, it's a secret.
[01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:30.672]  The people, the government can't even know what the agreements are.
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.723]  It's the same thing on this new bill for total amnesty.
[01:21:44.064 --> 01:21:47.608]  Thank God the four senators have leaked it, but it's called a Z Visa.
[01:21:47.928 --> 01:21:48.950]  An unlimited total visa.
[01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:49.911]  You don't have to leave the country.
[01:21:49.931 --> 01:21:51.773]  You can bring 11 of your family members in.
[01:21:52.394 --> 01:21:54.196]  It allows unlimited worker visas.
[01:21:54.637 --> 01:21:56.459]  I have the Fortune 500 request you come.
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.661]  It's the end of America!
[01:21:58.354 --> 01:22:02.477]  These people are protesting in our streets with foreign flags saying this belongs to Mexico.
[01:22:02.697 --> 01:22:03.658]  Get them out of here!
[01:22:04.158 --> 01:22:06.980]  Don't arrest Americans when they protest them back peacefully.
[01:22:07.801 --> 01:22:08.661]  It's disgusting!
[01:22:09.362 --> 01:22:18.929]  And finally, this is just auxiliary information that you covered a few months back about the Chinese, how they take dead bodies.
[01:22:20.186 --> 01:22:20.966]  I don't know.
[01:22:40.655 --> 01:22:51.555]  Well, right here in our own country, Friday's edition of the Kansas City Star reported that in Rochester, New York, they caught several funeral home directors stealing
[01:22:52.415 --> 01:22:53.376]  I don't think so.
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:14.744]  Before that, I was going to get my driver's license.
[01:23:14.764 --> 01:23:14.904]  I was 15.
[01:23:14.944 --> 01:23:17.049]  You know, going to get the hardship license.
[01:23:17.409 --> 01:23:19.294]  He said, don't sign the organ donor card.
[01:23:19.314 --> 01:23:19.935]  And I said, why?
[01:23:20.396 --> 01:23:22.901]  He goes, I've worked in a lot of hospitals, son.
[01:23:23.382 --> 01:23:24.004]  Don't sign it.
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:25.120]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:23:46.995 --> 01:23:48.377]  And, uh, my grandmother's still alive.
[01:23:48.397 --> 01:23:49.018]  God bless her now.
[01:23:49.038 --> 01:23:49.598]  Great-grandmother.
[01:23:50.079 --> 01:23:51.921]  My grandpa, though, passed five years ago.
[01:23:52.181 --> 01:23:53.563]  Love him so much, but never mind.
[01:23:53.803 --> 01:23:58.188]  Point is, I'm sitting there watching it, and they admitted hospitals around the country killing people for their organs.
[01:23:58.934 --> 01:24:00.294]  I mean, no, they wouldn't.
[01:24:00.654 --> 01:24:01.875]  There's no bad people.
[01:24:01.935 --> 01:24:02.855]  Everything's fine.
[01:24:03.235 --> 01:24:12.556]  You know, my whole life, like, I always never... I always told my family, like, you know, if something happens to me, they can donate my organs, but something always kept me from checking that box on that application there.
[01:24:12.676 --> 01:24:13.837]  Well, I mean, it's a great thing.
[01:24:13.877 --> 01:24:17.577]  I mean, you know, my grandmother died a few years ago.
[01:24:17.717 --> 01:24:19.298]  On the other side, she gave her body.
[01:24:19.678 --> 01:24:21.258]  My grandfather gave his body.
[01:24:21.738 --> 01:24:24.158]  But, you know, the thing is, that's fine.
[01:24:24.178 --> 01:24:24.739]  It's not bad.
[01:24:25.059 --> 01:24:27.059]  The problem is, is they take anything good and ruin it.
[01:24:27.719 --> 01:24:32.041]  By the way, there's a big push to take people's organs we kill, which then sets the precedent.
[01:24:33.502 --> 01:24:34.762]  It's just one step after another.
[01:24:34.782 --> 01:24:35.963]  The government loves you, Trey.
[01:24:36.183 --> 01:24:37.123]  Just learn to worship them.
[01:24:37.523 --> 01:24:38.764]  I gotta move really quick now.
[01:24:38.944 --> 01:24:41.005]  All these calls are so great.
[01:24:41.045 --> 01:24:43.566]  We had calls about Ron Paul, but they all hung up.
[01:24:43.626 --> 01:24:44.766]  Jack, John, Ellen, Chris.
[01:24:44.966 --> 01:24:46.067]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:24:46.827 --> 01:24:47.567]  Let's talk to one.
[01:24:47.587 --> 01:24:49.348]  We haven't talked to any women yet.
[01:24:49.768 --> 01:24:52.029]  Ellen in Montana, you're on the air.
[01:24:52.129 --> 01:24:52.490]  Welcome.
[01:24:54.150 --> 01:24:54.550]  Hi.
[01:24:55.171 --> 01:24:55.651]  Hi, welcome.
[01:24:56.407 --> 01:24:58.169]  Welcome, thank you for taking my call.
[01:24:59.250 --> 01:25:06.116]  Earlier you mentioned Bill Moore and I know that he had Ron Paul on a few weeks ago.
[01:25:06.136 --> 01:25:11.241]  Yeah, about a month ago and he attacked Ron Paul and he got blown out of the water and now he says he's sorry and he's going to have him back on.
[01:25:12.082 --> 01:25:13.623]  Oh yeah, he's his hero.
[01:25:14.084 --> 01:25:21.771]  I watched his show Friday night and I think if anybody missed it they really should see it because this is the audience that we have to get to.
[01:25:22.583 --> 01:25:24.285]  Uh, Bill Maher has a big audience.
[01:25:24.345 --> 01:25:26.228]  I think, you know, he's not a libertarian.
[01:25:26.268 --> 01:25:28.691]  I think, more or less, he's definitely a liberal.
[01:25:28.711 --> 01:25:29.872]  Well, I mean, let me just jump in.
[01:25:29.892 --> 01:25:32.235]  The reason I jump in is there's key info I want to add before I forget.
[01:25:33.272 --> 01:25:36.593]  Bottom line, I've looked at the political horses.
[01:25:36.973 --> 01:25:39.353]  Hillary's going to win if it's any other Republican.
[01:25:39.833 --> 01:25:41.994]  Only Ron Paul can beat Hillary.
[01:25:42.294 --> 01:25:45.575]  Republicans have blown their name, blown their constituency.
[01:25:45.595 --> 01:25:49.716]  A bunch of Democrats will vote for Ron Paul who don't like Hillary because she's a warmonger.
[01:25:50.136 --> 01:25:51.736]  A bunch of Republicans will vote for him.
[01:25:52.056 --> 01:25:56.357]  He can win if they just stop trying to censor him and let him become popular.
[01:25:56.397 --> 01:25:56.677]  Go ahead.
[01:25:59.703 --> 01:26:03.946]  I think anybody who missed that show Friday night should see it.
[01:26:04.107 --> 01:26:14.095]  I think a good part of it was also when Ma had Chris Dodd and he interviewed him and he basically gave Dodd help
[01:26:14.710 --> 01:26:22.016]  Because Dodd was saying, he asked him about Ron Paul and Dodd said, oh no, you know, he took the stance of the Republicans.
[01:26:22.136 --> 01:26:24.458]  Yeah, they keep calling him because they're circling the wagons.
[01:26:24.478 --> 01:26:25.438]  They're all on the same team.
[01:26:26.099 --> 01:26:27.640]  That illusion is now disappearing.
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:32.003]  In fact, you can go watch the Bill Maher piece at prisonplanet.com right now.
[01:26:32.063 --> 01:26:32.824]  It's up on YouTube.
[01:26:33.084 --> 01:26:34.245]  We have a link to it on the main page.
[01:26:34.265 --> 01:26:35.166]  And yes, I did see it.
[01:26:35.466 --> 01:26:36.307]  She's absolutely right.
[01:26:36.347 --> 01:26:38.729]  Thank you so much for the call, Ellen.
[01:26:39.209 --> 01:26:40.470]  You're absolutely on target.
[01:26:43.124 --> 01:26:47.288]  Ron Paul, again, ladies and gentlemen, is the only candidate that can beat Hillary.
[01:26:47.549 --> 01:26:47.949]  Period.
[01:26:48.009 --> 01:26:48.930]  You want Hillary Clinton?
[01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:49.871]  Don't vote for him.
[01:26:50.292 --> 01:26:52.013]  But they keep calling him a second-tier candidate.
[01:26:52.234 --> 01:26:53.515]  He is a first-tier candidate.
[01:26:53.695 --> 01:26:56.638]  He's won all the debates, in the polls, in everything!
[01:26:57.099 --> 01:26:59.841]  That's why they're scared to death of him and censoring him.
[01:27:00.042 --> 01:27:02.684]  You know, they don't censor the other little Patriot news sites and websites.
[01:27:02.965 --> 01:27:04.226]  They censor Prison Planet, folks.
[01:27:04.246 --> 01:27:05.247]  They censor InfoWars.
[01:27:05.774 --> 01:27:06.374]  There's a reason.
[01:27:06.675 --> 01:27:08.716]  Because we're having an effect, and they better be scared.
[01:27:09.036 --> 01:27:16.301]  Michelle Malkin and all these phony conservatives better be scared, because we're going to take this country back, and the traitors are going to get in some serious trouble.
[01:27:16.341 --> 01:27:20.024]  Let's go ahead, and those that call for banning free speech are going to get in serious trouble.
[01:27:20.044 --> 01:27:22.265]  That's called treason.
[01:27:22.525 --> 01:27:25.227]  Let's talk to John in Livermore, California.
[01:27:25.567 --> 01:27:26.268]  You're on the air.
[01:27:26.328 --> 01:27:26.908]  Welcome, John.
[01:27:27.509 --> 01:27:27.929]  Hey, Alex.
[01:27:27.969 --> 01:27:28.649]  How you doing today?
[01:27:28.729 --> 01:27:29.030]  Good, sir.
[01:27:29.050 --> 01:27:29.390]  Go ahead.
[01:27:29.955 --> 01:27:34.936]  Alright, there's this website called USAElectionPolls.com, have you heard of that website?
[01:27:35.056 --> 01:27:37.036]  Yes, and they're not listing Ron Paul.
[01:27:37.816 --> 01:27:49.039]  Yeah, well they actually, it looks like they're writing an article that's complaining, like on our side, saying there's only 5 polls out of 32 that it doesn't list Ron Paul, and they got him at 1%.
[01:27:49.079 --> 01:27:50.819]  I've actually got it, let me dig it out, keep going.
[01:27:51.459 --> 01:27:56.780]  Yeah, and it says Ron Paul is disputed from home state, 1%, and he's not even listed in the Texas polls.
[01:27:57.595 --> 01:27:58.295]  I'm really concerned.
[01:27:58.315 --> 01:27:59.416]  I know you're concerned about it.
[01:27:59.436 --> 01:28:04.258]  That's how they're doing it, is they're not listing him in the polls so they can say he isn't in the polls.
[01:28:04.699 --> 01:28:12.743]  In Texas, he won by 67 points in the election two and a half years ago.
[01:28:12.763 --> 01:28:21.407]  In the last one, in a new district gerrymandered against him by Tom DeLay by design, he won by 64% in a predominantly black liberal district.
[01:28:22.768 --> 01:28:27.890]  Long Paul's winning in black liberal districts, and he's got conservatives behind him.
[01:28:27.930 --> 01:28:29.151]  He's the dream candidate.
[01:28:30.031 --> 01:28:30.571]  It's unbelievable.
[01:28:30.591 --> 01:28:35.593]  They've got Newt Gingrich listed with 26 polls, and he's not even pledged to run yet.
[01:28:36.654 --> 01:28:37.514]  I know they won't.
[01:28:37.534 --> 01:28:42.756]  In fact, I've got the analysis from PrisonPlanet.com here, and it's from USElectionPolls.com.
[01:28:42.916 --> 01:28:44.657]  What we do is advertise all the news there.
[01:28:45.248 --> 01:28:50.132]  And it says pollsters censoring Ron Paul from the states he would do well in statistical analysis.
[01:28:50.172 --> 01:28:51.813]  He's being censored everywhere.
[01:28:51.853 --> 01:28:56.316]  Listen, we were being censored at the Bob Bullitt Museum last night.
[01:28:57.097 --> 01:29:00.519]  They were telling the number one station in town, Calvary Jail, they couldn't go live from there.
[01:29:00.739 --> 01:29:03.661]  They were telling national TV they couldn't come in.
[01:29:04.462 --> 01:29:06.103]  Finally they capitulated and let them in.
[01:29:06.503 --> 01:29:09.746]  But the point is, anybody else can go in there.
[01:29:09.846 --> 01:29:11.307]  I've been there at other events.
[01:29:12.256 --> 01:29:12.776]  Here's the deal.
[01:29:12.796 --> 01:29:13.817]  I've got loaded phone lines.
[01:29:13.937 --> 01:29:16.459]  I've got news about Mexican police that patrol the U.S.
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:19.662]  I've got news about human animal clones.
[01:29:20.703 --> 01:29:21.503]  London Guardian.
[01:29:22.064 --> 01:29:25.847]  I've got news on Gordon Brown, the next to be Prime Minister, calling for one world government.
[01:29:26.667 --> 01:29:30.110]  I've got teachers staging fake gun attacks on children.
[01:29:30.971 --> 01:29:32.892]  I've got just government gone crazy.
[01:29:32.932 --> 01:29:34.874]  And I've got the Ron Paul speech I want to play.
[01:29:35.815 --> 01:29:37.136]  I've got to decide what I'm going to do here.
[01:29:38.256 --> 01:29:39.678]  Final segment, straight ahead.
[01:29:39.778 --> 01:29:40.358]  Stay with me.
[01:29:40.478 --> 01:29:41.339]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:52.933 --> 01:29:55.874]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:29:56.034 --> 01:30:01.296]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:30:01.556 --> 01:30:06.878]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:30:07.259 --> 01:30:08.319]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:08.739 --> 01:30:17.544]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:30:18.065 --> 01:30:19.665]  Now compare Calben Pure Soap.

[01:31:00.714 --> 01:31:03.860]  Your debt creation is probably the smartest thing you've ever done.
[01:31:04.321 --> 01:31:05.884]  How would it be to find $75,000, $150,000, $200,000 or more you never knew you had?
[01:31:09.298 --> 01:31:13.721]  Now the task force has strategies to make these debts into virtual savings accounts.
[01:31:14.281 --> 01:31:16.643]  Ben Franklin said, a penny saved is a penny earned.
[01:31:17.243 --> 01:31:25.689]  By doing nothing more than you're doing right now, because you've used your credit, the right strategies can make the debt part of your financial life the smartest thing you've ever done.
[01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:28.951]  Oh, by the way, your strategies cost you nothing out of pocket.

[01:34:14.224 --> 01:34:19.608]  I'm not going to have time to get into the Seattle newspapers and others.
[01:34:19.969 --> 01:34:20.729]  What's this other one?
[01:34:20.749 --> 01:34:20.889]  The St.
[01:34:20.929 --> 01:34:25.953]  Louis Post-Dispatch saying there's no such thing as a new world order or a global government or a North American Union.
[01:34:25.973 --> 01:34:28.875]  But we'll put an article out in the next few days on the sites on that.
[01:34:28.895 --> 01:34:31.277]  More hybrid embryos get the go-ahead.
[01:34:32.198 --> 01:34:34.460]  Human-animal embryos for research.
[01:34:35.901 --> 01:34:37.802]  Even if you're just not even ethically against that.
[01:34:38.483 --> 01:34:42.166]  The scientists are concerned about the rise of different types of viruses.
[01:34:42.899 --> 01:34:43.620]  Very serious.
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:47.562]  Let me just cover this, jam a few calls and then play part of Ron Paul's speech from last night.
[01:34:47.582 --> 01:34:50.485]  You can watch the rest of it up at PrisonPlot.com where it is.
[01:34:51.765 --> 01:34:56.689]  Santa Fe Police Department looking into hiring Mexican Nationals, Associated Press.
[01:34:56.729 --> 01:35:02.093]  The Santa Fe Police Department is considering the possibility of recruiting Mexican Nationals to fit vacant police jobs.
[01:35:02.625 --> 01:35:04.166]  Because it says they've got to have people 20 to 25.
[01:35:04.326 --> 01:35:08.608]  You've got to have people that don't ask questions and will violate the Constitution.
[01:35:08.828 --> 01:35:10.609]  Why don't we hire some 30, 40 year old people?
[01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.690]  They need jobs.
[01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:14.051]  Oh, no, no, we've got to have young people with them.
[01:35:14.652 --> 01:35:18.734]  I heard Fox News earlier on the radio say, call us civilians again.
[01:35:18.794 --> 01:35:20.815]  Police responded to the civilians.
[01:35:21.335 --> 01:35:24.778]  The government's civilian, too, unless you're under martial law, which we are under.
[01:35:25.018 --> 01:35:26.279]  See, these things mean things.
[01:35:26.299 --> 01:35:27.740]  These words mean things.
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:31.323]  When the mayor calls us civilians, shut up, you scumbag!
[01:35:31.683 --> 01:35:32.163]  All of you.
[01:35:32.524 --> 01:35:33.364]  You work for us.
[01:35:33.404 --> 01:35:36.286]  It's not a military dictatorship, even if you claim it is.
[01:35:37.567 --> 01:35:38.068]  I'm sorry.
[01:35:38.108 --> 01:35:40.049]  I could spend all day on the Mexican police.
[01:35:40.069 --> 01:35:41.090]  We already have them here, folks.
[01:35:41.570 --> 01:35:45.794]  Seven towns in South Texas, El Cenizo, one of them, fly the Mexican flag, no English allowed.
[01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:48.976]  That was in the news ten years ago on the San Antonio Express News.
[01:35:51.255 --> 01:35:51.935]  Oh my God.
[01:35:53.196 --> 01:35:53.436]  U.S.
[01:35:53.456 --> 01:35:54.976]  military recruiting foreigners.
[01:35:55.016 --> 01:35:55.776]  The numbers grow.
[01:35:56.496 --> 01:35:57.177]  We're done with that.
[01:35:57.297 --> 01:35:57.637]  Look at this.
[01:35:57.697 --> 01:36:00.117]  Teacher staged fake gun attack on kids.
[01:36:00.557 --> 01:36:03.118]  This was earlier this week in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.
[01:36:03.598 --> 01:36:10.480]  Staff members of elementary school staged a fictitious gun attack on students during a class trip, telling them it was not a drill and that they were going to die.
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.441]  That it was an attacker coming to kill them.
[01:36:12.721 --> 01:36:15.161]  Then the armed man in a mask tried to get in the door.
[01:36:15.541 --> 01:36:16.702]  The students screamed and cried.
[01:36:16.742 --> 01:36:17.642]  They were in elementary.
[01:36:18.228 --> 01:36:19.169]  That's Associated Press.
[01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:20.090]  You can go read the rest of it.
[01:36:20.110 --> 01:36:22.413]  Just type into Google, teacher staged fake gun attack.
[01:36:22.693 --> 01:36:26.297]  Then I got another one here, teachers and students panicked by fake gun drill at school.
[01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:29.381]  This out of Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:36:29.621 --> 01:36:35.969]  But this time they had students with four fake guns saying they were going to kill everyone and people passed out, pooped themselves.
[01:36:36.069 --> 01:36:36.850]  It's a regular deal.
[01:36:37.410 --> 01:36:38.331]  This is mind control.
[01:36:38.351 --> 01:36:39.512]  This is all federally funded.
[01:36:39.692 --> 01:36:42.054]  And they always tell them, this is Christians, this is homeschoolers.
[01:36:42.354 --> 01:36:43.234]  We're here to kill you.
[01:36:43.535 --> 01:36:47.257]  It's all to demonize guns and train people to lay prostrate before the police.
[01:36:47.277 --> 01:36:48.878]  This is federal brainwashing.
[01:36:49.499 --> 01:36:51.100]  And it's completely and totally criminal.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:55.984]  But they're setting a precedent to be able to do things that are this criminal in your face.
[01:36:56.304 --> 01:36:58.485]  Alright, I'm going to accelerate quickly through calls, folks.
[01:36:58.505 --> 01:37:03.409]  We've only got about 30 seconds or so apiece, because I've got to get to Ron Paul, Jack, John, Chris, Daniel, and others.
[01:37:04.129 --> 01:37:06.270]  Let's go to Jack in Springville, Missouri.
[01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:07.230]  You're on the air.
[01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:08.050]  Go ahead, Jack.
[01:37:09.191 --> 01:37:10.011]  Hey, Alex.
[01:37:10.111 --> 01:37:10.731]  Hi, go ahead.
[01:37:11.692 --> 01:37:18.814]  I just got a phone call last night and I was thinking about going to Congressman Dennis Moore's house and protesting outside.
[01:37:18.914 --> 01:37:20.015]  Yes, that's what, I've done that.
[01:37:20.155 --> 01:37:27.297]  Anyone who's for the amnesty bill, Lloyd Doggett, Michael McCall, right here in Texas, anybody around the country, you go protest their houses.
[01:37:27.677 --> 01:37:33.139]  And we've done that, and I don't care if it's just you and five friends, if you're right, let the cops arrest you, you're going to own their houses.
[01:37:34.756 --> 01:37:37.438]  So, but I don't have any people that can go with me.
[01:37:37.999 --> 01:37:43.264]  Just make sure it's you or two or three of your buddies and that's right down the street with a video camera when they try to stop you in your First Amendment.
[01:37:43.644 --> 01:37:50.150]  You go out there and you let these pieces of trash that want to have blank an amnesty and literally break the back of this country.
[01:37:50.370 --> 01:37:52.051]  We cannot survive another amnesty.
[01:37:52.291 --> 01:37:54.934]  It's part of the NAU plan to flood us with foreigners.
[01:37:54.994 --> 01:37:57.716]  It's in the official declassified SPP documents.
[01:37:58.297 --> 01:37:59.217]  JudicialWatch.org
[01:38:01.345 --> 01:38:01.605]  Go ahead sir.
[01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:04.327]  You can look it up on my website, evolutionofdeception.com.
[01:38:04.387 --> 01:38:06.248]  Good, put it up there and you go protest them.
[01:38:06.548 --> 01:38:10.451]  Let's go ahead and Dr. John in North Colorado, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:38:10.871 --> 01:38:12.112]  Yes, thanks for doing my talk.
[01:38:12.132 --> 01:38:12.873]  Two points here.
[01:38:13.173 --> 01:38:19.377]  First one, you as many others like myself are tired of getting our First Amendment rights and due process trampled.
[01:38:19.864 --> 01:38:23.771]  What you need to do is get a hold of Randy Kelton in Boyd, Texas.
[01:38:24.252 --> 01:38:26.055]  The public officials ought to know about him.
[01:38:26.696 --> 01:38:30.262]  They're scared to death of him because he used a grand jury to get them in line.
[01:38:30.703 --> 01:38:32.887]  Well, grand juries and juries are important.
[01:38:33.602 --> 01:38:41.587]  And you're right, we need to get into jury nullification and learn that we're the bosses, we're the sovereigns, it's government servants, not officials or authorities.
[01:38:41.788 --> 01:38:43.188]  We're not civilians.
[01:38:43.769 --> 01:38:48.312]  I mean, again, TxDOT tells the legislature you can't see our agreements with foreign companies.
[01:38:48.612 --> 01:38:57.678]  Turns out when we get the documents, they're not putting any money in, we're paying for the roads they're building, handing it to them, 200 plus billion in profits they'll make just on phase one the next 15-20 years.
[01:38:58.038 --> 01:39:00.300]  I mean, it's the same thing, it's just highway robbery.
[01:39:01.081 --> 01:39:03.283]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Toronto.
[01:39:03.523 --> 01:39:05.064]  You're on the air from Canada.
[01:39:05.084 --> 01:39:05.805]  Go ahead, Chris.
[01:39:06.506 --> 01:39:07.026]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:07.126 --> 01:39:08.728]  Thanks for everything you do.
[01:39:08.868 --> 01:39:09.188]  Thank you.
[01:39:09.208 --> 01:39:09.549]  Go ahead.
[01:39:09.749 --> 01:39:10.950]  We're watching closely up here.
[01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:14.854]  I just saw yesterday, I was really surprised, a front page national post
[01:39:16.225 --> 01:39:26.890]  Why is Al Gore's film being shown in schools everywhere, when even the experts agree that global warming is a big controversy?
[01:39:27.050 --> 01:39:32.473]  Global warming is not man-made, and thank God for it, or we'd be entering another ice age.
[01:39:32.553 --> 01:39:39.256]  I've done massive research, top Nobel Prize winners, they claim every scientist agrees, they lie and put them on that UN report.
[01:39:39.916 --> 01:39:42.979]  Carbon dioxide is what plants breathe, and they put out higher oxygen.
[01:39:43.199 --> 01:39:44.200]  It is not a pollutant.
[01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:45.821]  It's a global tax.
[01:39:45.902 --> 01:39:48.644]  It's in the SPP, North American Union documents.
[01:39:48.884 --> 01:39:49.945]  That's why the St.
[01:39:49.965 --> 01:39:51.827]  Louis Post-Dispatch says it doesn't exist.
[01:39:52.127 --> 01:39:53.408]  It's a big part of their agenda.
[01:39:53.448 --> 01:39:55.410]  Last caller, Daniel, in Illinois.
[01:39:55.450 --> 01:39:56.010]  You're on the air.
[01:39:56.050 --> 01:39:56.431]  Go ahead.
[01:39:57.071 --> 01:39:57.632]  Yes, Alex.
[01:39:57.692 --> 01:39:59.433]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:39:59.614 --> 01:40:04.438]  I was wondering, what can an average, everyday person with no college education
[01:40:05.091 --> 01:40:07.673]  Do to fight against the things that are going on now.
[01:40:08.034 --> 01:40:19.263]  Okay, you go get the articles, you go to the SPP documents, and you read the thousands of pages, and you find the little quotes where they say, keep it secret, North American Union, set up a carbon tax, hype fake global warming.
[01:40:19.483 --> 01:40:24.707]  You take screenshots of that, you write little blurbs on it, you upload it to message boards four or five times a day.
[01:40:24.927 --> 01:40:31.453]  You get my film Terror Storm for free off Google Video, and you burn copies of it to disk with the download function, and you give it to people.
[01:40:31.893 --> 01:40:34.115]  And you have faith in yourself and belief in yourself.
[01:40:34.135 --> 01:40:35.276]  Who cares if you don't have college?
[01:40:35.497 --> 01:40:36.337]  Bill Gates doesn't.
[01:40:36.397 --> 01:40:37.318]  Rush Limbaugh doesn't.
[01:40:37.719 --> 01:40:39.560]  Most of the Fortune 500 CEOs don't.
[01:40:40.021 --> 01:40:41.142]  Nothing bad with college.
[01:40:41.202 --> 01:40:43.244]  It teaches you how to go up a middle level job.
[01:40:43.604 --> 01:40:46.587]  Most people in real power positions didn't go to college, didn't finish it.
[01:40:46.967 --> 01:40:49.950]  College teaches you how to work as a cod, not to be a leader.
[01:40:50.190 --> 01:40:51.151]  Not knocking college.
[01:40:51.351 --> 01:40:52.552]  I'm just telling you the facts of life.
[01:40:52.813 --> 01:40:56.436]  So don't you ever feel like you don't have worth because you didn't go to college.
[01:40:56.836 --> 01:40:58.797]  We're going to just take the show out here with Ron Paul.
[01:40:58.837 --> 01:40:59.617]  When it ends, it ends.
[01:40:59.797 --> 01:41:02.438]  We only have time to play about 4 or 5 minutes of the 18 minute speech he gave.
[01:41:02.738 --> 01:41:07.580]  I'm sorry, I just wanted to take calls and get to the news, but it'll all be up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:14.983]  Don't forget, my film Terror Storm is in stores nationwide for the next month, then it's gone, and second edition will be in stores nationwide.
[01:41:15.003 --> 01:41:18.364]  But get Terror Storm, or watch it free at Google Video, but if you want to support us,
[01:41:18.684 --> 01:41:19.444]  You know, isn't it strange?
[01:41:19.784 --> 01:41:24.486]  It's for a minute assumed, which it shouldn't be too great of an assumption, that I defend the Constitution more so than the rest of it.
[01:41:48.675 --> 01:41:57.506]  But isn't it interesting also that the establishment figure is the one who most defends the Constitution has to be eliminated from the debates.
[01:41:57.566 --> 01:41:59.007]  What's going on in this country?
[01:42:04.121 --> 01:42:11.485]  Well, you know, I'm not going to ask, but I do know that there are a few people in here who are not traditional Republicans.
[01:42:11.585 --> 01:42:13.386]  Some call themselves independent.
[01:42:13.906 --> 01:42:15.367]  Some call themselves libertarians.
[01:42:15.427 --> 01:42:18.768]  Some call themselves even Democrats!
[01:42:18.909 --> 01:42:20.389]  There may be some Democrats here!
[01:42:23.011 --> 01:42:28.093]  Now, the art of politics is to bring people together.
[01:42:28.113 --> 01:42:29.374]  It's not to be divisive.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:39.667]  When you're running for an office, if you're overly pure in the sense of, you know, you have to agree A, B, C, D. You have to bring coalitions together.
[01:42:39.847 --> 01:42:40.888]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:42:41.148 --> 01:42:45.892]  And there are several groups of people that make up an electorate that I think are important this time.
[01:42:46.412 --> 01:42:57.661]  I think at the top of the list of the people who are looking for leadership in this country today are dealing with the complications from a very, very flawed foreign policy.
[01:43:03.738 --> 01:43:18.049]  And if we look at what happened in the election last year, I think the message was loud and strong, that they're sick and tired of the consequences of the foreign policy that we have, and they're looking for something new and different.
[01:43:18.069 --> 01:43:27.936]  And, quite frankly, anybody on the Democratic side that really has answered the call to come around and have a different foreign policy, because it looks to me like it's more of the same thing.
[01:43:36.388 --> 01:43:39.029]  I think that issue brings a lot of people together.
[01:43:39.369 --> 01:43:53.214]  All the various political factors will come together and right now it looks like probably about 70% of the country is now looking for a different policy, especially in the Middle East and readjust that.
[01:43:53.935 --> 01:44:02.598]  On economic policy, it is something that if you ask almost 100% of the Americans whether they believe in the free enterprise system, you know what?
[01:44:03.217 --> 01:44:05.378]  Most Americans believe in the free enterprise system.
[01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:15.283]  Too often, though, too often what happens is, yes, I believe in free enterprise for myself, but I like, I mean, for everybody else, but I like special privileges for myself.
[01:44:16.024 --> 01:44:23.688]  So, but to really believe in free enterprise, you have to believe in market competition for everybody, and nobody gets subsidies!
[01:44:24.768 --> 01:44:29.371]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that's it.
[01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:32.833]  Maybe next week I'll get some of the highlights of them for the rest of it.
[01:44:32.873 --> 01:44:42.863]  But thank you for joining us today to all the affiliates across the country, from upstate New York, Norfolk, Virginia, to sunny Southern California, to right here in Austin, Texas, to the global shore.
