[00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:06.528]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.188 --> 00:00:08.268]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:10.069]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:11.530]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.190]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.532]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:22.113]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.622 --> 00:00:33.543]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome!
[00:00:33.563 --> 00:00:36.324]  It is the second day of April 2007 and we're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:36.565 --> 00:00:37.505]  Where to start today?
[00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:39.567]  I don't want to be alarmist as the mainstream media is
[00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:08.306]  But there can be no doubt that there is an intention to attack Iran.
[00:01:10.187 --> 00:01:17.650]  And the aftermath of that, at the bare minimum, will be devastating to our economy.
[00:01:20.392 --> 00:01:22.953]  And it could be far, far worse.
[00:01:26.064 --> 00:01:50.732]  We have to take serious the fact that there are two major carrier task force groups and several other support groups, a huge armada, as big as the armada that launched the 2003 invasion of Iraq, in the Persian Gulf right now, with another aircraft carrier on its way.
[00:01:54.176 --> 00:02:12.828]  Now, what the New World Order crowd does with psychological warfare, like they did in 2002 announcing they would attack in March of 2002 and then not attacking, is continue to announce that they're going to attack day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, until it's a foregone conclusion.
[00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:22.434]  For two years, we've been hearing out of the Defense Department, out of Israel, and out of the other big-wig organizations that run this country,
[00:02:24.628 --> 00:02:41.871]  This country's military and its foreign policy that there would be an attack on Iran that Israel could launch the attack or the US could launch a sneak attack on hundreds of military sites not just the Bashir reactor and other nuclear development sites with their atomic program.
[00:02:46.352 --> 00:02:51.913]  What that does is that conditions you to expect that it's going to happen and at a subconscious level
[00:02:54.369 --> 00:03:07.436]  The voyeur in all of us, or the deep animal, or beast, or bloodlust in all of us, pretty much wants to see it happen, wants to see the fight.
[00:03:07.536 --> 00:03:08.817]  You expect it.
[00:03:08.857 --> 00:03:12.019]  You've been hearing it so much, you say, let's just get it over with already.
[00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:13.479]  You expect it.
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.982]  This is basic psychology that is being used 101.
[00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:26.451]  Now, at the conscious level, we don't want the war.
[00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:28.433]  We know it will kill thousands of innocents.
[00:03:28.453 --> 00:03:31.716]  We know it will plunge the dollar even further and jack up oil prices.
[00:03:33.217 --> 00:03:39.803]  We know it's a fraud and it will demonize the good name of the United States to an even greater extent worldwide.
[00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:44.968]  But you expect it to happen.
[00:03:45.698 --> 00:03:57.360]  It becomes that unknown country, that exotic place you want to visit in your mind's eye because they continue to hammer it, you just expect it.
[00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:10.692]  It's like if you heard an ad for five years about a new supercomputer that was going to come out and it was going to revolutionize desktop computing, you know, that would be on your cell phone and then it didn't come out in five years.
[00:04:11.213 --> 00:04:18.437]  Even if you weren't into that new device coming out five years ago, you'd be into it now because you've been told it was coming so long.
[00:04:20.178 --> 00:04:22.300]  That's kind of a way to simplify it.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.101]  It's basic marketing.
[00:04:26.326 --> 00:04:35.571]  And so you have a public 70 plus percent that is against a war, against the Iraq war, against expansion, and they just get conditioned though to expect it.
[00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:40.153]  And I've always said that's the danger of this show.
[00:04:40.173 --> 00:04:44.055]  It's one of the reasons they let people like me continue on without killing me.
[00:04:45.295 --> 00:04:48.657]  Because they believe that it acts as a conditioning mechanism.
[00:04:49.665 --> 00:04:53.046]  But I think they're beginning to understand that that's actually backfiring on them.
[00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:58.807]  We'll explain this, but it's very complex, very sophisticated, but also very simple at a certain level.
[00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:00.927]  PrisonPlanet.com's the website.
[00:05:02.347 --> 00:05:08.028]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:10.449]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:18.450]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:26.217]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.597 --> 00:05:38.023]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.343 --> 00:05:41.805]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:42.306 --> 00:05:44.247]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.567 --> 00:05:48.409]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:01.297 --> 00:07:06.080]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:09.923]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[00:07:10.183 --> 00:07:16.488]  As you may have heard by now, Ken Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[00:08:03.971 --> 00:08:06.777]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.838 --> 00:08:17.979]  Wide open phones today, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:20.840]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.781]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:24.301 --> 00:08:31.964]  We're here live Monday through Friday, 11 to 2, Central Standard Time, and re-aired all over the country on wonderful AM and FM affiliates.
[00:08:31.984 --> 00:08:38.726]  A growing list, and we appreciate all the affiliates out there helping us get the word out in the battle for this republic.
[00:08:40.587 --> 00:08:44.408]  Alright, here's the news headlines on the Iran front.
[00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:53.497]  And again, they just keep putting this out every few weeks until we're finally conditioned and just expect this to be a foregone conclusion.
[00:08:55.719 --> 00:08:59.803]  Small blast rocks UK Embassy in Iran.
[00:09:00.804 --> 00:09:07.391]  And you read the Reuters report, it basically sounds like some firecrackers got detonated and there were some plumes of smoke.
[00:09:09.272 --> 00:09:11.453]  And now Time Magazine's reporting about U.S.
[00:09:11.473 --> 00:09:16.475]  troops shooting and being in a firefight with Iranian troops a month ago.
[00:09:19.577 --> 00:09:21.038]  Here's the Jerusalem Post.
[00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:22.298]  U.S.
[00:09:22.378 --> 00:09:25.760]  ready to strike Iran on Good Friday.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.301]  Another headline.
[00:09:28.961 --> 00:09:30.962]  This time out of the London Evening Standard.
[00:09:32.343 --> 00:09:34.364]  Russian official says U.S.
[00:09:34.404 --> 00:09:36.925]  will be ready to strike Iran in April.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:49.407]  A report filed today by the Russian News Agency, RIA Novosti, investigates and indicates that Russian intelligence has information that the U.S.
[00:09:49.508 --> 00:09:57.593]  Armed Forces have nearly completed preparations for a possible military operation against Iran and will be ready to strike in early April.
[00:09:58.957 --> 00:10:01.618]  Citing a security official, the article alleges the U.S.
[00:10:01.658 --> 00:10:09.641]  had already compiled a list of possible targets on Iranian territory and practiced the operation during recent exercises in the Persian Gulf last week.
[00:10:10.181 --> 00:10:18.424]  The report aligns with previous reports by the New Yorker and Raw Story surrounding build-up towards a possible strike.
[00:10:22.985 --> 00:10:24.746]  Very, very interesting.
[00:10:26.265 --> 00:10:34.114]  And it's also interesting to note that now a website like RawStory, which has been up a few years, is now being cited by the London Evening Standard.
[00:10:37.017 --> 00:10:44.766]  Also, the Debka file is reporting that all over the Middle East, in the Gulf region,
[00:10:45.695 --> 00:10:55.838]  The hotels are filling up with reporters and military advisors and personnel and their support staff, a lot of private contractors and computer specialists.
[00:10:56.198 --> 00:10:59.859]  The spooks are descending on the Middle East right now.
[00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:01.500]  There is a massive build-up.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:09.125]  But the massive buildup is only stacking up in train right now with no sign of letting up.
[00:11:09.205 --> 00:11:14.028]  So that tells me we're at least a few months away from the attack.
[00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:15.069]  But they'll have headlines.
[00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:17.831]  They could strike on the 4th.
[00:11:18.651 --> 00:11:20.312]  Why, that's in two days.
[00:11:21.153 --> 00:11:22.114]  That's on Wednesday.
[00:11:22.174 --> 00:11:25.216]  Or they're going to strike on Friday in the early morning hours.
[00:11:25.936 --> 00:11:27.017]  And that could happen.
[00:11:28.138 --> 00:11:29.979]  We could wake up Saturday morning
[00:11:31.545 --> 00:11:42.948]  And learn that US fighter bombers and backed up by British fighter bombers have struck WMD manufacturing facilities.
[00:11:43.368 --> 00:11:49.450]  The Saudis continue and Bush will be on television talking about why he's launched the strike to keep us safe.
[00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:56.292]  And then, of course, Iran can retaliate.
[00:11:56.912 --> 00:12:05.318]  If they retaliate in any way while huge 1,000 and 2,000 pound bombs and cruise missiles rain down on them, they will be called terrorists.
[00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:15.384]  The public will double-think and run around screaming about how they are unbelievably evil to even raise their forearm to block a blow.
[00:12:17.105 --> 00:12:21.427]  I'll be called a traitor if I say that Iran has a right to defend itself.
[00:12:21.467 --> 00:12:22.428]  You'll be called a traitor.
[00:12:23.866 --> 00:12:33.870]  The people who are under the slave system in this nation, the very elite launching the war against Iran and Iraq, are the people destroying our sovereignty, our borders, our Bill of Rights, our culture.
[00:12:34.291 --> 00:12:35.611]  Doesn't matter to the general public.
[00:12:36.071 --> 00:12:39.773]  Doesn't matter if they've devalued their dollar and financially raped them, they love it!
[00:12:40.273 --> 00:12:49.357]  They'll run around, about 25% or so, absolutely in vitriolic vitriol, just prostrating themselves before the New World Order.
[00:12:50.174 --> 00:12:53.395]  And it'll go up from 25% to 35, maybe 40%.
[00:12:53.795 --> 00:12:56.256]  Some people will shift back into groupthink while it's happening.
[00:12:56.536 --> 00:12:57.397]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:12:57.417 --> 00:13:00.098]  5% of you could be for the war and they would continue it.
[00:13:00.278 --> 00:13:02.979]  But they want the illusion that it's your will.
[00:13:04.119 --> 00:13:05.980]  So, feel powerful.
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.161]  Feel powerful.
[00:13:10.861 --> 00:13:11.142]  U.S.
[00:13:11.182 --> 00:13:13.402]  carrier deploys amid Iran tensions.
[00:13:13.903 --> 00:13:14.823]  Agency French Press.
[00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:21.093]  Nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz, will sail Monday to support U.S.
[00:13:21.173 --> 00:13:23.995]  operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S.
[00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:30.620]  Navy said, amid a spike in tensions over Iran's seizure of 15 British Marines and sailors.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:45.710]  The Nimitz and its battle group of destroyers and guided-missile cruisers will relieve the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, which this week took part in war games exercises in the Gulf, with another carrier, the USS John S. Stennis.
[00:13:48.058 --> 00:13:59.180]  And if you think it's going to relieve the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, it left the West Coast a few days ago.
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.761]  It'll take it a few weeks to get there.
[00:14:04.782 --> 00:14:09.202]  And I would look for that to be a prime time to strike.
[00:14:10.163 --> 00:14:16.444]  But again, it could be Friday morning, Saturday morning, it could... that's our time here.
[00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:24.992]  It could be anytime.
[00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:32.176]  Between now and the end of 2007.
[00:14:34.658 --> 00:14:36.919]  Going in to the elections.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:39.780]  We don't know.
[00:14:40.761 --> 00:14:47.905]  But we have to take this serious, because Bush and Israel and all of them are talking about how they may strike, they may hit them any minute.
[00:14:49.126 --> 00:14:49.726]  By the way,
[00:14:50.954 --> 00:14:55.516]  The London Guardian, it was just so much huge news, and I've got it here in the stack.
[00:14:57.277 --> 00:15:16.347]  The London Guardian reported, and it's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, but it was buried in the last two paragraphs that the British government, the Foreign Office, has now said, okay, mistakes were made and we want a diplomatic solution to this.
[00:15:17.668 --> 00:15:34.843]  And that's of course because the former head of the Maritime Administration and others have gone public in major publications in England yesterday and Saturday saying, on record, on record, that Britain rewrote the maps.
[00:15:35.743 --> 00:15:38.666]  Britain rewrote the maps and issued new fake maps.
[00:15:39.407 --> 00:15:42.529]  So in the world of, it depends on what the word is, is is,
[00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:52.670]  Britain just rewrote the maps as reported Friday, but now it's been officially admitted, and that they just claimed the territorial waters of Iran.
[00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.192]  So, they can say, well no, these are the waters of Iraq.
[00:15:57.812 --> 00:16:01.194]  And they can say our maps show that, but they just changed them.
[00:16:02.535 --> 00:16:05.776]  That's kind of like Mexico saying the Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[00:16:07.377 --> 00:16:13.600]  It isn't really the case, but they're saying it does, so is that accurate?
[00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:18.631]  They can argue about the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo all day long.
[00:16:20.572 --> 00:16:28.935]  Kind of like your neighbor could suddenly, one day you walk out in the backyard on a Sunday morning and he's out there moving his fence post five feet into your property.
[00:16:28.955 --> 00:16:37.578]  And you walk up and you go, hey man, I've lived here for twenty years, you've lived here for ten, and I've got the blueprints in there.
[00:16:38.303 --> 00:16:41.105]  I've got the layout of my acreage and your acreage.
[00:16:41.145 --> 00:16:41.686]  What are you doing?"
[00:16:41.706 --> 00:16:46.449]  And he just goes, well, I just rewrote the map and it says I own this.
[00:16:48.791 --> 00:16:50.032]  You're going to get pretty mad.
[00:16:51.993 --> 00:16:54.135]  Especially because it's right there where that river comes out.
[00:16:55.516 --> 00:16:57.057]  I mean, that's prime real estate.
[00:16:58.358 --> 00:17:01.200]  For oil and navigation.
[00:17:04.469 --> 00:17:08.693]  And please don't send me an email going, your son with Iran.
[00:17:09.954 --> 00:17:11.175]  We don't have a government.
[00:17:11.195 --> 00:17:12.396]  Do you understand that?
[00:17:12.456 --> 00:17:16.379]  The people wanting to attack Iran are destroying the United States.
[00:17:16.399 --> 00:17:17.620]  And I don't use that figuratively.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.323]  I mean, the country has been in the North American Union for two years and two weeks.
[00:17:23.484 --> 00:17:26.347]  Mid-March 2005, we entered it.
[00:17:26.467 --> 00:17:26.967]  Officially.
[00:17:27.087 --> 00:17:27.368]  Okay?
[00:17:27.568 --> 00:17:28.769]  We have the four year documents.
[00:17:31.811 --> 00:17:32.692]  This is public now.
[00:17:33.934 --> 00:17:34.554]  Lou Dobbs.
[00:17:39.077 --> 00:17:44.940]  So, that's where I stand, and that's the basic facts.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.722]  And I don't know where you stand out there that still support the fraud and the lies.
[00:17:50.383 --> 00:18:00.349]  But Iran had their government overthrown violently by the US and Britain in 1953, and had their leaders publicly beheaded, decapitated, their heads chopped off.
[00:18:02.657 --> 00:18:07.042]  Because they wouldn't give all their oil to England and the Anglo-American Oil Company.
[00:18:09.524 --> 00:18:10.865]  Now known as British Petroleum.
[00:18:11.786 --> 00:18:12.747]  Owned by the Queen of England.
[00:18:16.371 --> 00:18:20.195]  And then in the 80's they shot down some of their jet airliners right there at a key time.
[00:18:20.951 --> 00:18:22.732]  Trying to get Iran to attack the U.S.
[00:18:22.752 --> 00:18:23.292]  so the U.S.
[00:18:23.312 --> 00:18:33.016]  could go in right at the end of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988, with our little ally, our gallant little ally, Saddam, nerve-gassing them and the rest of it, while they nerve-gas right back.
[00:18:33.597 --> 00:18:34.177]  With our U.S.
[00:18:34.217 --> 00:18:37.899]  advisors running the whole op and they have the nerve to blame Saddam.
[00:18:37.939 --> 00:18:47.823]  I made the point yesterday on my Sunday syndicated show that it'd be like if a street-level mafia muscle man, enforcer, soldier, went out and did a murder.
[00:18:48.283 --> 00:18:49.644]  Went out and capped somebody.
[00:18:50.413 --> 00:18:52.515]  Popped him three times in the back of the head with a .22.
[00:18:53.455 --> 00:18:54.056]  Long rifle.
[00:18:54.556 --> 00:18:59.019]  And then the guy gets busted by the FBI and he goes in before the federal judge and it's the Mafia Don.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.601]  That's the U.S.
[00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:10.488]  I'm not for the guy that is out killing people, but the Mafia boss that gave the order is more guilty than he in precedent and in common law.
[00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:19.375]  And then it's just too rich on top of that to have the judge, the arrogant, self-righteous judge, be
[00:19:20.945 --> 00:19:22.046]  The one that gave the order!
[00:19:23.026 --> 00:19:33.812]  And then, of course, in 1988, they launched Operation Praying Mantis, where they blew up a bunch of Iran's battleships, their missile cruisers, destroyers, patrol boats, just out of the blue.
[00:19:35.113 --> 00:19:43.757]  Claimed some mine in Iranian waters that hit one of our ships, and just went in and killed a couple thousand people.
[00:19:44.438 --> 00:19:46.999]  They shot an airliner out of the sky, 290 people.
[00:19:47.259 --> 00:19:48.440]  Blew an Airbus to pieces.
[00:19:49.429 --> 00:19:58.907]  And Iran sits there and takes it, folks, because they know that Papa New World Order wants to drop some nukes on them and turn them into a parking lot.
[00:20:01.463 --> 00:20:06.668]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:20:06.828 --> 00:20:14.916]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:20:15.176 --> 00:20:22.223]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:20:22.403 --> 00:20:23.684]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[00:20:23.764 --> 00:20:29.668]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:20:29.848 --> 00:20:34.932]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:20:35.052 --> 00:20:43.938]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:20:44.198 --> 00:20:51.142]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at
[00:21:02.506 --> 00:21:06.167]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:06.587 --> 00:21:12.008]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:12.469 --> 00:21:13.549]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:13.569 --> 00:21:17.570]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:31.601]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:37.406]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:37.706 --> 00:21:43.591]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:21:44.331 --> 00:21:45.573]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.593 --> 00:21:47.295]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:21:47.315 --> 00:21:47.735]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.755 --> 00:21:49.777]  Exercise your legal rights to trade metals privately.
[00:21:49.797 --> 00:21:49.857]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:03.095 --> 00:22:05.137]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:05.778 --> 00:22:14.708]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:22.357]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:23.067 --> 00:22:28.552]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:22:29.052 --> 00:22:39.881]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:40.621 --> 00:22:42.703]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:22:43.203 --> 00:22:44.625]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:22:49.169 --> 00:22:51.673]  Or, visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:22:51.894 --> 00:22:52.214]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:05.241]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:23:05.761 --> 00:23:09.063]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:23:09.443 --> 00:23:12.385]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:23:12.665 --> 00:23:19.029]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:23:19.109 --> 00:23:23.532]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:23:23.752 --> 00:23:28.114]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:23:28.275 --> 00:23:30.876]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:23:30.916 --> 00:23:33.677]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:23:34.138 --> 00:23:36.679]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:23:36.719 --> 00:23:40.981]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:23:41.021 --> 00:23:41.862]  Treasury bonds.
[00:23:42.142 --> 00:23:46.785]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:23:46.945 --> 00:23:48.607]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:23:48.627 --> 00:23:50.188]  That's 1-8888-XANADU or 1-8888-XANADU and ask for George.
[00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:12.960]  Welcome back!
[00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:51.899]  Alright.
[00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:53.261]  There's a lot here on my plate.
[00:24:54.142 --> 00:24:56.024]  Here's the story of the Calgary Herald.
[00:24:56.044 --> 00:24:58.466]  That's a pretty big paper up in Canada.
[00:24:59.447 --> 00:25:03.292]  The curious tale of the other WTC tower.
[00:25:04.972 --> 00:25:12.575]  And the article basically lays out the facts of Building 7 being a controlled demolition and asks all the pertinent serious questions.
[00:25:15.456 --> 00:25:24.580]  Meanwhile, the neocons have gone into hyper super overdrive against the 9-11 Truth Movement and Rosie O'Donnell and Charlie Sheen.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.041]  We have some new developments on that.
[00:25:27.665 --> 00:25:31.247]  that are going up on PrisonPlanet.com as we speak.
[00:25:31.387 --> 00:25:37.411]  Big breaking news I'll tell you about in the next section, in the next segment.
[00:25:38.531 --> 00:25:42.374]  But right now, let me just go back to the Iran situation.
[00:25:43.254 --> 00:25:51.419]  We do have the former head of the British Maritime Administration, who is also a former British Ambassador, Craig Murray, who has joined us before.
[00:25:51.959 --> 00:25:55.061]  He'll be coming on for about 30 minutes in the next hour.
[00:25:55.842 --> 00:26:14.106]  He wrote a big report on his blog that got picked up by even conservative papers in England with the facts that the British simply rewrote the maps claiming disputed territorial waters that Iran had traditionally always had.
[00:26:15.866 --> 00:26:24.168]  And all Iran says is, hey, you have to split the line coming out of the river out 12 miles into international waters.
[00:26:25.231 --> 00:26:30.135]  They just say 50-50, and the British say, no, no, no.
[00:26:31.136 --> 00:26:36.720]  You're going to need to give us about 65% of the water.
[00:26:37.321 --> 00:26:39.783]  And Iran says, no, you're not.
[00:26:41.684 --> 00:26:43.326]  Now, that's how it works, folks.
[00:26:43.426 --> 00:26:45.608]  Countries split the waterway.
[00:26:47.009 --> 00:26:48.670]  Well, not when you're the New World Order.
[00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:54.575]  And I feel sorry for those British sailors, those British commandos on board that craft, being sent
[00:26:55.516 --> 00:27:14.151]  In there, and being told, and of course they can have the head of the cruiser that the rubber boat was dispatched off of saying, well it was on our map, they were in our waters, they were following the charts they were given.
[00:27:15.272 --> 00:27:16.153]  They follow orders.
[00:27:18.454 --> 00:27:22.938]  And then another one of the commanders above him said, well these are disputed waters.
[00:27:24.238 --> 00:27:28.319]  But see, by the time Tony Blair got done with it, the lie was believed.
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:36.842]  And all Iran is saying, who's been bombed, and had their country overthrown, and had the Shah put in, and over 200,000 people disappeared, and black-bagged, and tortured to death.
[00:27:36.882 --> 00:27:37.703]  I mean, this is admitted.
[00:27:39.403 --> 00:27:48.126]  I mean, wouldn't you hate Iran if they would have overthrown our country in 1953, and taken the Congress, and chopped their heads off at a sports stadium?
[00:27:49.047 --> 00:27:50.987]  By the way, this is what the British and US did.
[00:27:51.388 --> 00:27:52.428]  Chopped their heads off.
[00:27:53.487 --> 00:27:54.808]  And it wasn't like they were moolahs.
[00:27:54.848 --> 00:28:08.057]  No, it was a ball-headed Mohamed Mozadek, who was a big poet and liberal, and by liberal he wanted to fund the population and build up Iran, Persia into a first world country.
[00:28:08.477 --> 00:28:09.778]  The birthplace of mathematics.
[00:28:09.958 --> 00:28:11.499]  He kicked the communists out of his country.
[00:28:12.219 --> 00:28:15.101]  They weren't about to let there be any strong civilization there.
[00:28:15.962 --> 00:28:22.186]  Now look, you can knock Africa all day and say they can't climb up out of the murk, but Africa has been out of the murk before.
[00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.151]  Not that there isn't tribalism and problems.
[00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:29.612]  And you can sit there and say that only the West developed civilization.
[00:28:29.992 --> 00:28:31.933]  And it certainly developed some of the heights of it.
[00:28:33.293 --> 00:28:37.495]  But the Chinese, the Japanese, many have had advanced civilizations.
[00:28:38.195 --> 00:28:43.817]  And the Persians had some of the earliest and most advanced civilizations.
[00:28:44.737 --> 00:28:46.518]  And they're not allowed to get
[00:28:48.001 --> 00:28:49.022]  up into the first world.
[00:28:49.662 --> 00:28:55.985]  Every time they try, a neighbor is financed to attack them with billions of dollars worth of weaponry, and a million Iranians died.
[00:28:56.265 --> 00:29:03.209]  So let me say, they financed Saddam to kill over a million of them, overthrew their government, and killed over 200,000.
[00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:11.193]  With Operation Praying Mantis in 88, blew up most of their navy, just out of the clear blue sky, giant attack.
[00:29:13.795 --> 00:29:14.556]  It goes on and on.
[00:29:14.616 --> 00:29:19.480]  Blew up a couple of their jet airliners at the same time, trying to get them to, you know, come on, come on, do something.
[00:29:19.961 --> 00:29:27.908]  It's like the old western, as Bill Hicks would say, where the bad guy comes in and drops the gun in front of the 12 year old after he's killed his daddy and says, pick up the gun.
[00:29:29.109 --> 00:29:33.412]  Come on mister, I just wanted some rock candy and some gigum for my mom.
[00:29:34.313 --> 00:29:35.494]  I said pick up the gun.
[00:29:35.514 --> 00:29:39.498]  But this, the little kid won't pick the gun up, so
[00:29:40.293 --> 00:29:43.677]  The bad guy goes and grabs his mom and starts slapping her in the face.
[00:29:44.619 --> 00:29:45.940]  And still they didn't pick up the gun.
[00:29:47.182 --> 00:29:49.084]  I wonder when they get bombed if they'll pick up the gun.
[00:29:51.407 --> 00:29:52.308]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:54.391]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.312 --> 00:29:57.996]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:32:02.056 --> 00:32:04.758]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[00:32:05.138 --> 00:32:08.141]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[00:32:08.421 --> 00:32:10.502]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?

[00:32:41.928 --> 00:32:48.409]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:33:19.433 --> 00:33:22.754]  Into this world we're thrown.
[00:33:23.715 --> 00:33:28.356]  Like a dog without a bone and actor out of loan.
[00:33:29.057 --> 00:33:30.637]  Riders on the storm.

[00:34:02.844 --> 00:34:04.426]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:34:04.806 --> 00:34:08.689]  Your calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:17.396]  We've got Eric Schein, who worked inside the federal government, involved in a lot of different maritime operations.
[00:34:17.436 --> 00:34:21.820]  He'll be joining us to shed light on some of the things that are developing.
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:29.186]  We have the former head of the British Maritime Administration, Ambassador Craig Murray, joining us coming up in about 25 minutes.
[00:34:32.884 --> 00:34:37.469]  But let me finish up with some of the news that is here in front of me today that is extremely important.
[00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:42.014]  I'm going to get to the Rosie O'Donnell news in just a minute.
[00:34:42.094 --> 00:34:44.256]  First, I want to talk about Alberto Gonzalez.
[00:34:46.518 --> 00:34:51.944]  Headline today, Bush backs Gonzalez says no evidence of wrongdoing.
[00:34:52.605 --> 00:34:53.586]  Now, let's be clear here.
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:35:14.178]  First, the media, the mainstream media, the supposed liberal media, tri-Pentagon, CIA media, steered media, they're not all CIA or FBI or Defense Intelligence, but it's definitely run by these people, run by spooks, and they try to steer everything and edit all the key information out.
[00:35:15.139 --> 00:35:20.804]  They first claimed, well, I mean, Clinton fired all 100, they're allowed to fire 7 or 8 of these people.
[00:35:21.431 --> 00:35:22.092]  Certainly are.
[00:35:22.152 --> 00:35:27.095]  The point is, they fired them because they wouldn't engage in political prosecutions.
[00:35:29.857 --> 00:35:32.239]  Which we know the Clintons fired theirs for.
[00:35:32.379 --> 00:35:38.503]  It doesn't mean it's okay just because the Clintons are crooks and vacation with the Bushes and it's all staged.
[00:35:39.068 --> 00:35:40.009]  They're all crooks.
[00:35:40.129 --> 00:35:40.889]  I hate Hillary.
[00:35:41.009 --> 00:35:41.670]  I hate Bush.
[00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:48.174]  They're sniveling attack dog puppets, but I still hate the minions and the foot soldiers of the Globalist.
[00:35:48.675 --> 00:35:50.336]  But let's be clear, they're puppets.
[00:35:50.356 --> 00:35:52.157]  They hate it when you expose them as puppets.
[00:35:52.417 --> 00:35:55.179]  They love, they relish you thinking they actually run something.
[00:35:55.379 --> 00:35:56.440]  They're nobody.
[00:35:57.081 --> 00:36:04.766]  That little slack-jawed, bug-eyed, know-it-all on a power trip, that wicked control freak Hillary is nothing.
[00:36:05.845 --> 00:36:08.446]  That burnout drug addict George Bush is nothing.
[00:36:08.806 --> 00:36:11.167]  They're cowardly, degenerate scum.
[00:36:14.409 --> 00:36:20.332]  And so are all their pimps and servants like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh.
[00:36:21.172 --> 00:36:27.635]  They're all compromised, weak cordwood that's going straight into the fires of Hades.
[00:36:30.658 --> 00:36:35.404]  So we hear this and then it comes out that he says, Oh, I never heard of any plan to fire him.
[00:36:35.564 --> 00:36:36.906]  I didn't even know about the firings.
[00:36:37.226 --> 00:36:39.489]  Turns out all the meetings, memos get released.
[00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:40.731]  He ran the whole thing.
[00:36:41.672 --> 00:36:43.174]  Then he tries to spin that.
[00:36:44.015 --> 00:36:47.059]  Then Bush comes out and says he did nothing wrong and didn't know anything.
[00:36:48.163 --> 00:36:51.545]  This is the same crew that tortures children, writes memos about it.
[00:36:51.946 --> 00:36:57.809]  This is the same group of people that lie about WMDs and write up fake Yellow Cake Niger Uranium dossiers.
[00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:00.211]  I mean, these are the people building FEMA camps.
[00:37:00.471 --> 00:37:06.015]  These are the people pushing for blanket total amnesty and open borders and the end of the country.
[00:37:06.832 --> 00:37:13.258]  And then you sit there on the radio, I hear you neocons call in and, they're such good conservatives, they just love America.
[00:37:13.478 --> 00:37:16.701]  I mean, is there no load of baloney that you won't buy?
[00:37:16.721 --> 00:37:18.282]  Do you like being stupid?
[00:37:18.302 --> 00:37:19.623]  Do you like being conned?
[00:37:19.643 --> 00:37:21.525]  Do you like being taken for a ride?
[00:37:21.545 --> 00:37:23.066]  I mean, it's disgusting!
[00:37:23.086 --> 00:37:27.650]  And you're taking me, and my country, and my family over the cliff with you.
[00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.172]  And that's why I don't like you.
[00:37:29.192 --> 00:37:31.814]  I'm talking to the idiots out there.
[00:37:33.431 --> 00:37:37.873]  All I want you to do is have a good life and a good future, because I know what goes around comes around.
[00:37:38.174 --> 00:37:47.379]  If I'm going to have a good life and a good future, and my children and grandchildren are in the future to come, then you're going to have to be free too, even if I'm disgusted with you.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:54.903]  We're all in this together, and patriots are the best friends you've got.
[00:37:54.923 --> 00:38:01.006]  I was listening to XM radio out in the yard yesterday for a couple hours, doing some gardening, had some family over.
[00:38:03.124 --> 00:38:11.608]  And they had Cigar Dave was on attacking Rosie O'Donnell and I flipped over to a Limbaugh rebroadcast and they were calling us all traitors.
[00:38:12.088 --> 00:38:14.969]  Guess what the channels these guys were on on XM radio?
[00:38:15.029 --> 00:38:17.250]  It's called Patriot Channel.
[00:38:20.452 --> 00:38:24.913]  I mean that'd be like the Christian channel and you tune in and this is Satan 666.
[00:38:27.355 --> 00:38:30.496]  Worship the devil and you're the Christian channel on XM.
[00:38:31.087 --> 00:38:32.388]  Now, a word from Satan.
[00:38:32.428 --> 00:38:39.152]  I mean, it's just, they wrap themselves in the flag, they pose as the saviors of the troops, when they're the ones destroying them.
[00:38:39.172 --> 00:38:42.794]  Alright, I gotta hurry up, so I don't get to your calls.
[00:38:43.334 --> 00:38:44.334]  I want to play these clips, though.
[00:38:44.355 --> 00:38:50.438]  This is Gonzales, about a year and a half ago, talking about habeas corpus.
[00:38:51.318 --> 00:38:53.039]  I guess less than a year ago, actually.
[00:38:53.079 --> 00:38:56.882]  This is when they were trying to pass the Military Commission's Secret Arrest, Secret Torture of U.S.
[00:38:56.902 --> 00:38:57.542]  Citizens Act.
[00:38:58.177 --> 00:38:59.438]  It's not aliens, that's a lie.
[00:38:59.678 --> 00:39:00.819]  All the top lawyers have looked at it.
[00:39:02.299 --> 00:39:05.881]  And Gonzales says there's no habeas corpus for citizens.
[00:39:05.982 --> 00:39:09.884]  Now, this is like saying fish don't live in the water.
[00:39:10.884 --> 00:39:14.967]  This is like saying ducks don't quack and don't have little webbed feet.
[00:39:16.127 --> 00:39:22.211]  This is like saying, you know, Jesus wasn't from
[00:39:23.846 --> 00:39:24.526]  The Middle East.
[00:39:24.866 --> 00:39:27.427]  I mean, I mean, it's just total lying.
[00:39:27.948 --> 00:39:28.688]  Listen to this.
[00:39:28.708 --> 00:39:30.409]  And then I want to play another clip of him.
[00:39:30.449 --> 00:39:32.489]  Here it is.
[00:39:36.631 --> 00:39:48.096]  Where you have the Constitution having an explicit provision that the writ of habeas corpus cannot be suspended except for rebellion or invasion.
[00:39:49.856 --> 00:39:51.657]  And you have the Supreme Court saying
[00:39:53.112 --> 00:40:04.135]  That habeas corpus rights apply to Guantanamo detainees aliens in Guantanamo after an elaborate discussion as to why.
[00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:21.580]  How can it be a statutory taking of habeas corpus when there's an express constitutional provision that it can't be suspended and an explicit Supreme Court holding
[00:40:22.452 --> 00:40:25.955]  It applies to Guantanamo alien detainees.
[00:40:27.236 --> 00:40:28.356]  A couple of things, Senator.
[00:40:29.657 --> 00:40:36.543]  I believe that the Supreme Court case you're referring to dealt only with the statutory right to habeas, not the constitutional right to habeas.
[00:40:36.563 --> 00:40:37.884]  Well, you're not right about that.
[00:40:38.604 --> 00:40:43.648]  It's plain on its face they're talking about the constitutional right to habeas corpus.
[00:40:44.048 --> 00:40:46.290]  They talk about habeas corpus.
[00:40:46.957 --> 00:40:47.518]  We're good to go.
[00:41:06.121 --> 00:41:07.942]  When did you last read the case?
[00:41:08.502 --> 00:41:11.143]  It has been a while, but I'd be happy to go back.
[00:41:11.223 --> 00:41:12.283]  I will go back and look at it.
[00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:13.904]  Yesterday or this morning again.
[00:41:14.084 --> 00:41:15.184]  I will go back and look at it.
[00:41:15.824 --> 00:41:24.447]  The fact that the Constitution, again there is no express grant of habeas in the Constitution, there is a prohibition against taking it away, but it's never been the case.
[00:41:24.487 --> 00:41:26.168]  I'm not aware of a Supreme Court... Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:41:26.188 --> 00:41:31.510]  The Constitution says you can't take it away, except in case of rebellion or invasion.
[00:41:32.403 --> 00:41:37.226]  Doesn't that mean you have the right of habeas corpus unless there is an invasion or rebellion?
[00:41:37.406 --> 00:41:45.491]  I meant by that comment, the Constitution doesn't say every individual in the United States or every citizen is hereby granted or assured the right to habeas.
[00:41:45.511 --> 00:41:46.192]  It doesn't say that.
[00:41:46.212 --> 00:41:55.237]  It simply says the right to habeas corpus shall not be suspended except by... You may be treading on your interdiction and violating common sense, Mr. Kennedy.
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.081]  Well, there he is talking to
[00:42:02.635 --> 00:42:05.057]  Arlen Specter, and that was all a big event.
[00:42:05.637 --> 00:42:08.418]  Specter claimed he was against it, but then of course went with all of it.
[00:42:09.919 --> 00:42:15.142]  But the habeas corpus is in the Constitution, and you just heard the Attorney General say, no it's not!
[00:42:17.284 --> 00:42:20.285]  He said there's a prohibition against taking it away, but it doesn't guarantee it.
[00:42:22.687 --> 00:42:24.848]  I mean, that's like saying water isn't wet, folks.
[00:42:25.809 --> 00:42:31.472]  And I heard neocons on talk radio, so-called conservatives,
[00:42:32.413 --> 00:42:33.674]  Butchering the Bill of Rights.
[00:42:33.734 --> 00:42:36.195]  That means, see, it means you conserve the Bill of Rights.
[00:42:36.636 --> 00:42:38.497]  You don't throw it down the toilet.
[00:42:40.058 --> 00:42:41.419]  Throw it out the window with the baby.
[00:42:42.779 --> 00:42:50.444]  Now let's go to the Daily Show last week with Gonzales' newest spin, and then we'll get into Rosie O'Donnell's latest big developments there and take her calls.
[00:42:51.705 --> 00:42:56.588]  Meanwhile, returning to the Alberto Gonzales saga, he remains embroiled in the scandal over eight fired U.S.
[00:42:56.668 --> 00:43:01.251]  attorneys threatening to make him the first Hispanic Attorney General to resign in disgrace.
[00:43:01.371 --> 00:43:01.711]  Of course,
[00:43:02.555 --> 00:43:04.096]  We know he's not to blame.
[00:43:04.917 --> 00:43:10.461]  Was not involved in seeing any memos, was not involved in any discussions about what was going on.
[00:43:10.901 --> 00:43:15.924]  That's basically what I knew as the Attorney General.
[00:43:16.064 --> 00:43:21.128]  Well, I guess Alberto Gonzalez is the Attorney General, kind of like the homeless guy is mayor of the park.
[00:43:24.042 --> 00:43:27.046]  He's not actually involved in day-to-day operations.
[00:43:27.206 --> 00:43:29.249]  He's more of a general observer.
[00:43:29.269 --> 00:43:31.772]  So you see, Gonzalo's never had anything to do with this.
[00:43:31.812 --> 00:43:33.034]  I guess that story's over.
[00:43:33.454 --> 00:43:40.243]  I guess now we can all just relax and perhaps enjoy a little toaster cake and not worry at all about anything that might change that.
[00:43:40.884 --> 00:43:41.285]  Oh wait!
[00:43:41.565 --> 00:43:42.046]  Here it is!
[00:43:43.254 --> 00:43:55.185]  The Attorney General did in fact participate in a November 27th meeting about the firing and signed off on them according to a statement released by the Justice Department.
[00:43:58.806 --> 00:44:03.507]  But I'm sure that he has an explanation for this rather enormous discrepancy.
[00:44:03.907 --> 00:44:11.069]  When I said on March 13th that I wasn't involved, what I meant was that I had not been involved, was not involved in the deliberations.
[00:44:11.169 --> 00:44:12.429]  I don't recall being involved.
[00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:13.730]  Let me be more precise.
[00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:24.032]  You know, as the parent of a two and a half year old, I routinely hear more convincing explanations for how feces got in my DVD player.
[00:44:25.805 --> 00:44:42.138]  So now, as one of Gonzales' senior counsel has said that she will plead the fifth rather than testify in Congress, and members of Gonzales' own party are questioning his credibility, it's once again left to the White House to defend Gonzales with a sentence that appears to actually be eating itself.
[00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:46.342]  He doesn't recall having recollections about having deliberative discussions.
[00:44:46.362 --> 00:44:54.749]  That was a sentence so tortured, even the man who declared the Geneva Convention quaint wouldn't allow it to be used on prisoners.
[00:44:57.734 --> 00:44:58.715]  But it's not funny.
[00:45:00.575 --> 00:45:01.576]  It's not funny at all.
[00:45:02.716 --> 00:45:06.858]  The country doesn't support these criminals, but the Democrats predominantly do.
[00:45:06.878 --> 00:45:15.863]  And they put on these dog-and-pony shows where they try to vote that in a couple years we start a pull-out, that, oh, we can't put a date on it.
[00:45:16.963 --> 00:45:18.344]  They were never going to leave.
[00:45:18.384 --> 00:45:20.485]  You see, they write up official Pentagon plans.
[00:45:20.925 --> 00:45:26.848]  They're published in weapons publications and different strategia journals.
[00:45:28.326 --> 00:45:32.630]  And it's discussed by the people that actually are involved in real public life.
[00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:43.378]  Then there's 98% of the public who thinks they're involved in public life, who read the newspaper and believe the garbage they're told, and don't know how to decipher any of it.
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:55.028]  And I guess my problem in life is, I found out about this whole other world, this real world, and I didn't decide to go use it against people to get rich,
[00:45:55.735 --> 00:45:58.277]  I decided to get upset about it and fight these people.
[00:45:59.378 --> 00:46:08.946]  Because there's something disgusting about corrupt scum getting away with more and more and ripping people off and killing innocent people and invading nations in our name and destroying our country.
[00:46:10.087 --> 00:46:19.635]  But not for the yuppies of America, not for the good old boys, not for those that worship success and the trinkets and the baubles and the trappings of success above all of the things.
[00:46:22.893 --> 00:46:23.534]  They don't care.
[00:46:23.834 --> 00:46:26.336]  They'll do anything for the almighty dollar.
[00:46:26.356 --> 00:46:34.543]  And they've got a nation of degenerate whores, literal whores, who will do whatever it takes to get money and power.
[00:46:38.266 --> 00:46:40.127]  And that's where we stand right now.
[00:46:40.187 --> 00:46:44.291]  You've got a bunch, a degenerate core of sociopaths running things.
[00:46:44.955 --> 00:46:56.142]  who work for an inbred old-line sadistic elite, setting up a tyrannical one-world government, so they can carry out their eugenics hobby of population reduction against us.
[00:46:57.262 --> 00:47:04.607]  Yes, it's a scary science fiction book, it's 2007, the planet Earth, and it's real, and it's not fun.
[00:47:05.987 --> 00:47:11.871]  The good news is people intellectually, instinctively, spiritually, know that there is a great threat.
[00:47:12.446 --> 00:47:15.228]  And the government's sophisticated, and the media's sophisticated.
[00:47:15.548 --> 00:47:24.194]  They know, their top psychologists and sociologists and psychiatrists, they know, their symbologists, know that you feel a great evil.
[00:47:24.614 --> 00:47:26.235]  They know you feel a great threat.
[00:47:27.476 --> 00:47:37.183]  You can't put your finger on it, so they then bring in the facsimile of Islamic fascism, or criminals, or the terrorist.
[00:47:37.947 --> 00:47:47.950]  And hold that in front of you, and then it takes on reality in your mind, because your gut senses a great evil, a great growing wickedness.
[00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.030]  Do you understand what I'm saying there?
[00:47:51.171 --> 00:48:03.654]  Of course, obviously, there is such a thing as radical Islamists, and every time we track it back, it has Western intelligence agencies' hands puppeteering them.
[00:48:07.156 --> 00:48:13.438]  But statistically, you've got a better chance of being struck by lightning repeatedly in your life than being killed by an Islamo-fascist, but who cares?
[00:48:13.478 --> 00:48:18.640]  They've got beards, they've got dark skin, and they've got turbans, and man, they are scary.
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:29.743]  They are alien, and we just better worship the nice men in Darth Vader outfits that are shoving our children around and putting guns to their heads to keep us safe.
[00:48:31.818 --> 00:48:38.044]  Alright, this is an action alert, an action alert, up on PrisonPlanet.com, this just out.
[00:48:39.005 --> 00:48:56.220]  Rosie O'Donnell, on her blog today, went public with the fact that she was basically blackmailed by Bill O'Reilly, that if she talked about his pervert sex scandal, remember that, if she talked about that, that he would, quote, come after her personally.
[00:48:57.459 --> 00:49:00.502]  She's on record with the dirty tricks of the gangsters.
[00:49:12.768 --> 00:49:20.372]  He works for the Saudi Royal Family and the Bushes and Special Security Ops, so... I mean, I knew a few weeks ago when I heard him going, You're not coming back, Charlie!
[00:49:20.592 --> 00:49:21.673]  It's over for you!
[00:49:22.073 --> 00:49:22.934]  It's over, Mac!
[00:49:23.154 --> 00:49:24.575]  And then O'Reilly, we're warning you!
[00:49:24.715 --> 00:49:25.915]  You won't come back from this!
[00:49:26.156 --> 00:49:26.636]  Okay?
[00:49:28.057 --> 00:49:28.757]  You got that?
[00:49:29.778 --> 00:49:31.839]  You better... You better do what we say!
[00:49:35.141 --> 00:49:37.382]  Well, sure enough, they are mafia.
[00:49:38.877 --> 00:49:40.138]  O'Reilly Mafia.
[00:49:40.158 --> 00:49:41.779]  I mean, what do you call the Mafia?
[00:49:41.999 --> 00:49:42.820]  It's our thing!
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:43.980]  It's how they operate.
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.081]  Intimidation threats.
[00:49:45.641 --> 00:49:48.443]  O'Reilly Mafia threatens O'Donnell over sex scandal.
[00:49:48.923 --> 00:49:53.506]  Fox News host promises to go after the View host and her colleagues.
[00:49:54.167 --> 00:50:06.054]  Rosie O'Donnell, currently under attack after being questioned in the official story behind 9-11, has revealed that Fox News bully Bill O'Reilly threatened to go after her and her colleagues after they mentioned O'Reilly's sex scandal on the View.
[00:50:07.601 --> 00:50:12.183]  ABC has now gagged O'Donnell for mentioning the subject on all future broadcasts.
[00:50:12.503 --> 00:50:25.487]  But he gets to call for her, her firing, her arrest, they get to call for her murder on MSNBC, on Scarborough who had to leave Congress under a cloud.
[00:50:25.647 --> 00:50:29.769]  Just go, just type in why Scarborough left Congress.
[00:50:31.189 --> 00:50:36.071]  Within the past two weeks O'Reilly has threatened both Charlie Sheen and Mark Cuban that he'll
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:42.265]  Alright, we'll be right back with more of this and I'll get to your calls, don't worry.
[00:51:04.179 --> 00:51:09.627]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.008 --> 00:51:17.599]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.334 --> 00:51:25.378]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.778 --> 00:51:37.224]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.524 --> 00:51:41.006]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.467 --> 00:51:43.408]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.748 --> 00:51:47.590]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:13.891 --> 00:52:28.463]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:28.483 --> 00:52:28.803]  government.

[00:54:36.965 --> 00:54:38.365]  But it's up on Prison Planet.
[00:54:38.385 --> 00:54:39.845]  It just went up about ten minutes ago.
[00:54:40.005 --> 00:54:43.666]  O'Reilly Mafia threatens O'Donnell over sex scandal.
[00:54:44.147 --> 00:54:49.108]  Fox News host promises to go after The View host and her colleagues.
[00:54:50.848 --> 00:54:53.909]  And he's called to have both Charlie Sheen and Mark Cuban
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:55:24.493]  thrown into jail he has uh... demanded and said that Jim Fetzer and Kevin Barrett that he would use his influence to have the FBI investigate them and arrest them I mean this guy is unbelievable and now it turns out that Rosie O'Donnell is standing up to this guy and again love her or hate her folks she's got courage okay and she's waking up to the new world order so let's let's at least give her
[00:55:25.279 --> 00:55:32.848]  Give her a little time to flesh that out for her past activities, but I've got it on her personal friends who've talked to her.
[00:55:32.928 --> 00:55:34.810]  She knows about the new award now.
[00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:36.592]  She's had the paradigm shift.
[00:55:36.972 --> 00:55:38.234]  The goggles have come off.
[00:55:39.235 --> 00:55:41.077]  She's getting involved in real issues now.
[00:55:43.179 --> 00:55:46.063]  It says, when Joy and I, this is from her blog,
[00:55:47.285 --> 00:55:50.128]  Alluded to Bill O'Reilly's sex scandal on The View.
[00:55:50.428 --> 00:56:14.428]  We were told the following day that we couldn't bring it up anymore or else Bill, who goes after hosts on The View, hmm, I say his Friday Rosie spin on YouTube where he edited my statements to make it seem as he wanted, like 1984, molding the facts to suit the needs of Big Brother Rupert.
[00:56:16.044 --> 00:56:22.705]  And it goes on to say Parsons was Winston's fellow employee at the Ministry of Truth.
[00:56:22.965 --> 00:56:45.130]  And it goes on, he was a faddish but naive man of paralyzingly stupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms, one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges of whom, more even than the thought police, the stability of the party depended.
[00:56:46.372 --> 00:56:49.834]  Part of this got cut off, so I'm having to guess what the last word of each line is.
[00:56:49.874 --> 00:56:50.515]  Sorry about that.
[00:56:51.876 --> 00:56:53.477]  Question Authority America.
[00:56:54.558 --> 00:56:55.259]  It's too late.
[00:56:55.739 --> 00:56:56.860]  Spin, spin, spin.
[00:56:57.661 --> 00:57:01.644]  And then she quoted O'Brien while he's torturing Winston from 1984.
[00:57:03.439 --> 00:57:07.922]  Don't you see the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought?
[00:57:08.302 --> 00:57:21.792]  Has it ever occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very least, not a single human being will be able, who will be alive, who will be able to understand such conversations as we're having now?
[00:57:22.332 --> 00:57:24.513]  The whole climate of thought will be different.
[00:57:24.553 --> 00:57:28.136]  In fact, there will be no thought as we understand it now.
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:32.101]  Orthodoxy means not thinking, not needing to think.
[00:57:32.701 --> 00:57:35.081]  Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.
[00:57:35.861 --> 00:57:36.481]  We're awake.
[00:57:36.901 --> 00:57:37.502]  Peace out.
[00:57:37.522 --> 00:57:38.622]  Okay.
[00:57:39.182 --> 00:57:40.762]  She's quoting 1984.
[00:57:40.842 --> 00:57:42.322]  She's talking about the New World Order.
[00:57:42.562 --> 00:57:44.843]  She's talking about false flag, Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:57:47.523 --> 00:57:51.444]  Again, we're pretty close to getting Rosie O'Donnell on the show.
[00:57:51.464 --> 00:57:52.504]  We'll see if we're able to do it.
[00:57:53.544 --> 00:57:56.845]  But she's under a lot of heat right now, a lot of intimidation right now.
[00:57:58.129 --> 00:58:04.113]  We told you months ago she was awake to 9-11, because we talked to some of her associates, but that she couldn't go public on her show.
[00:58:04.593 --> 00:58:07.135]  She did go public three and a half weeks ago on her blog.
[00:58:07.595 --> 00:58:11.518]  Now it's exploded into week two, one of the top stories in the country.
[00:58:11.918 --> 00:58:21.804]  We have to show the intimidation and the underhanded tactics of neocon un-American Phil, like Bill O'Reilly, who calls for the end of the First Amendment.
[00:58:22.325 --> 00:58:23.566]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:25.359 --> 00:58:28.983]  Get this article and get it out to everybody!
[00:58:29.824 --> 00:58:32.687]  O'Reilly Mafia threatens O'Donnell over sex scandal.
[00:58:33.348 --> 00:58:33.688]  Get it?
[00:58:34.208 --> 00:58:35.750]  Get it out to everybody!
[00:58:36.511 --> 00:58:38.072]  Let's defeat these people!
[00:58:40.575 --> 00:58:45.480]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:57.720]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.381 --> 00:58:59.441]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.142 --> 00:59:01.243]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.923 --> 00:59:02.723]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.484 --> 00:59:04.384]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.045 --> 00:59:08.707]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.227 --> 00:59:13.310]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:21.454 --> 00:59:27.937]  We are scheduled in the next segment to have Craig Murray, former British Ambassador and former head of the Maritime Administration, on with us.
[00:59:30.219 --> 00:59:35.201]  But GCN's international phone system isn't working right now, so he's having to call in.
[00:59:35.821 --> 00:59:37.822]  Right now, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[00:59:38.623 --> 00:59:41.524]  Skip, in uh... Where are you calling from, Skip?
[00:59:42.845 --> 00:59:43.745]  Northern California.
[00:59:44.226 --> 00:59:44.706]  Welcome, sir.
[00:59:45.459 --> 00:59:46.800]  Alright, so check this out.
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:48.600]  There's a few things I want to let you know about.
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:55.983]  One is, I went to Staples and you can go there and you can have them make a rubber stamp with anything you want to say on it.
[00:59:56.663 --> 01:00:05.827]  So I made a rubber stamp that said that 11 was an inside job and underneath it it says www.infowars.com and I put the stamp every bill that I get.
[01:00:06.627 --> 01:00:11.149]  If everybody does this it'll turn every dollar into a flyer and no one's going to throw a dollar away.
[01:00:11.169 --> 01:00:14.430]  So you've got to understand it's an unenforced
[01:00:15.393 --> 01:00:20.899]  Crime, but no one really gets arrested to mutilate the precious private fellow reserve of slave notes.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:24.502]  But yes, it is a fabulous idea.
[01:00:25.884 --> 01:00:36.615]  In fact, I wouldn't want to say on air that I routinely, when I'm standing in a line, start writing InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com on my cash.
[01:00:37.055 --> 01:00:38.497]  But that's an even better idea.
[01:00:39.528 --> 01:00:45.611]  And it also makes them then recall that cash, that's what they do, but not before it goes through hundreds of hands.
[01:00:45.651 --> 01:00:54.295]  So, oh, it's a terrible idea to stamp the Rothschild-Rockefeller mode of enslavement with the truth.
[01:00:54.595 --> 01:00:55.996]  Oh, how bad of you!
[01:00:56.016 --> 01:00:58.957]  Okay, well, this gets better.
[01:00:59.858 --> 01:01:05.961]  Me and a group of people that I associate with are burning as many copies of Freedom from Fascism as we can.
[01:01:07.168 --> 01:01:15.754]  What we want to do is on April 15th, hit up every post office we have access to and just give them out to people and come check this out.
[01:01:16.314 --> 01:01:26.581]  You know, when you talk about this, I just feel the power of the people rising together with one mission to bring down the Federal Reserve and the New World Order and defeat them.
[01:01:27.021 --> 01:01:31.004]  And they just keep telling us, you don't have power, you don't have power, you can do nothing, you can do nothing, nobody cares.
[01:01:31.424 --> 01:01:32.805]  They are scared to death.
[01:01:33.265 --> 01:01:36.908]  And I'm telling you, with what you're doing, what millions of others are doing, we're going to bring them down.
[01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:41.169]  Thank you.
[01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:48.191]  On every DVD, in addition to writing America, Freedom, and Fascism, we also write Infowars.com on there.
[01:01:48.811 --> 01:02:00.375]  But I think if any listener out there does this, if everyone collectively contributes to this, it's going to get out to a lot of people that would never otherwise be open to the movement.
[01:02:00.495 --> 01:02:05.437]  And I think that the beauty of Freedom and Fascism is it shatters the left-right paradigm.
[01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:11.106]  Let people know that this isn't about Democrats or Republicans.
[01:02:11.126 --> 01:02:13.468]  This is about the government as a whole.
[01:02:13.848 --> 01:02:14.189]  It is.
[01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:16.131]  In fact, I have $120 in my wallet.
[01:02:16.551 --> 01:02:24.359]  Let me just write, I-N-F-O-W-A-R-S dot com.
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:26.381]  There you go.
[01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:29.148]  No, I agree with you.
[01:02:29.168 --> 01:02:31.329]  In fact, that's what we've seen with American Freedom from Fascism.
[01:02:31.369 --> 01:02:32.270]  It's an excellent film.
[01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:43.975]  I'm not saying it isn't, you know, hardcore and advanced, but it is hardcore and advanced in the fight against the globals, but it's also, well done, simply put, very effective introduction.
[01:02:44.315 --> 01:02:47.357]  Hey, here's an introduction to who owns and runs you.
[01:02:47.637 --> 01:02:49.618]  And then, oh, by the way, they're carrying out the terror.
[01:02:49.898 --> 01:02:50.858]  Here's a terror storm.
[01:02:51.639 --> 01:02:52.479]  After they've seen that.
[01:02:55.712 --> 01:03:05.156]  Oh, another point I had was a couple weeks ago you had a caller call in from Prague and say that InfoWars is like everywhere, people are talking about your show.
[01:03:05.176 --> 01:03:10.759]  I went there June last year and I bought as many copies of Loose Change and Martial Law as I could.
[01:03:11.739 --> 01:03:15.001]  And I went to Prague, Hamburg, and Amsterdam.
[01:03:15.281 --> 01:03:17.041]  I went to every bar, every club.
[01:03:17.202 --> 01:03:20.303]  I went to the DJs, I passed them out and told them about this.
[01:03:21.088 --> 01:03:22.969]  Nobody was talking about him for us back then.
[01:03:23.289 --> 01:03:24.430]  Nobody even knew about your show.
[01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:30.832]  It may have been you, Johnny Appleseed, and now there are beautiful orchards of succulent apples.
[01:03:31.292 --> 01:03:32.353]  I appreciate your call.
[01:03:33.553 --> 01:03:34.114]  Keep it up.
[01:03:34.814 --> 01:03:44.178]  Well, in countries like Mexico, or Czechoslovakia, or China, where they've lived under tyranny, the truth is accepted.
[01:03:45.618 --> 01:03:49.360]  It's a little harder here with the brain-dead public, but they're starting to wake up.
[01:03:55.623 --> 01:04:01.090]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:01.471 --> 01:04:09.101]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:09.801 --> 01:04:16.843]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.244 --> 01:04:28.667]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.987 --> 01:04:32.569]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:32.949 --> 01:04:34.869]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:39.051]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:52.415 --> 01:04:53.175]  Terrorism!
[01:04:53.316 --> 01:04:54.076]  Terrorism!
[01:04:54.176 --> 01:05:00.239]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:05:00.499 --> 01:05:02.100]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:04.801]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:19.769]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:19.809 --> 01:05:20.109]  government.
[01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:22.110]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:28.391]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:28.511 --> 01:05:33.012]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.
[01:05:33.272 --> 01:05:38.873]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:40.693]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:40.713 --> 01:05:40.893]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:40.913 --> 01:05:42.674]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:05:51.946 --> 01:05:56.893]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:05:57.213 --> 01:05:59.095]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[01:05:59.296 --> 01:06:02.340]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.664]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:06:05.964 --> 01:06:07.807]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:06:08.067 --> 01:06:11.768]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:06:12.048 --> 01:06:14.709]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible!
[01:06:14.729 --> 01:06:19.611]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[01:06:19.831 --> 01:06:24.072]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:06:24.512 --> 01:06:28.855]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[01:06:29.155 --> 01:06:33.418]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[01:06:33.758 --> 01:06:39.622]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[01:06:39.922 --> 01:06:42.363]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[01:06:42.564 --> 01:06:43.064]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:06:43.084 --> 01:06:44.185]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[01:06:52.429 --> 01:06:57.471]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:57.851 --> 01:07:00.132]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:20.279 --> 01:07:36.406]  The news broke last Friday that the British had just redrawn the map there with Iran and then said, yeah, our map shows that this is Iraqi waters.
[01:07:37.707 --> 01:07:45.670]  But you can look at the map and see that it's not split where they admit the ship was picked up, the boat was picked up, that it was not on the
[01:07:49.694 --> 01:08:03.344]  Iraqi side because in the previous agreement it's 50-50 down the middle of the waterway with a red line sticking out of the river that comes out 12 miles into the Gulf.
[01:08:05.826 --> 01:08:07.347]  It's real simple how this works.
[01:08:07.968 --> 01:08:17.255]  They were way over the line and we did call the British ambassador today and he agreed to come on.
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:22.664]  But for about a month, the international phone system has been unable to dial out.
[01:08:22.684 --> 01:08:23.425]  It hasn't been fixed.
[01:08:24.386 --> 01:08:28.049]  And I'm just making the announcement in case people don't know.
[01:08:28.749 --> 01:08:37.257]  And what's happening is the guest is trying to call in, but having trouble with his international code to get on the air with us.
[01:08:37.277 --> 01:08:42.562]  So who knows when or how or why or if he'll be joining us on air.
[01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:48.191]  Okay.
[01:08:49.952 --> 01:08:53.613]  Let me go ahead now and go back to your calls.
[01:08:54.113 --> 01:08:56.134]  David, in Pennsylvania.
[01:08:56.174 --> 01:08:56.574]  Go ahead.
[01:08:57.374 --> 01:08:58.054]  Hello, sir.
[01:08:59.094 --> 01:09:05.956]  I heard Dr. Deagle last week said he had somebody explain to him that on April 6th they thought something would happen.
[01:09:05.976 --> 01:09:07.657]  Well, I had some information.
[01:09:07.677 --> 01:09:14.419]  I don't want to say where I got it from, but that April 9th might be a day, and I hope that doesn't happen because I have so many things
[01:09:15.157 --> 01:09:16.478]  Still left, I want to do.
[01:09:16.498 --> 01:09:21.663]  I mean, things, when I say something happened, I mean something that would be like a 9-11 event, something that serious.
[01:09:21.763 --> 01:09:27.328]  But you know about something, but you don't want to even give us a hint of where the information came from.
[01:09:28.089 --> 01:09:30.351]  Well, because I don't know if it's credible.
[01:09:30.711 --> 01:09:34.595]  And so if something was to happen, I'd like to come on and explain after the fact.
[01:09:34.755 --> 01:09:37.377]  But I have
[01:09:38.755 --> 01:09:58.367]  I also wanted to mention also, you had talked about Iran and the possible, plausible theories as to why they want to attack Iran so bad, and I read an article that said that Iran had actually the second largest volume of oil still in the ground out of any nation in the world.
[01:09:58.667 --> 01:10:04.651]  Yes, they have the second largest discovered oil reserves, but that's debatable.
[01:10:04.731 --> 01:10:08.073]  Some say Venezuela may have, but it's definitely in the top three.
[01:10:09.111 --> 01:10:13.533]  And another thing I wanted to mention real quick and I'll get off, I enjoy listening to you discuss things.
[01:10:13.573 --> 01:10:18.856]  When you were talking last week about those kids and what was happening in Texas.
[01:10:19.585 --> 01:10:31.988]  It brings the Bible, and I'm not trying to preach, but it brings the Bible even more alive of how evil people really are, that they can stand up like Johnny Sutton, or I think that was his name, and say, well, we don't know that they're being hurt.
[01:10:32.308 --> 01:10:40.810]  It makes God say on the Bible how evil people really are, because it blows my mind how children can be treated like that.
[01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:46.151]  And I could hear the pain in your voice, and I felt the same way, and it made me so angry to hear
[01:10:47.031 --> 01:10:48.532]  Those kind of things are being done.
[01:10:48.812 --> 01:10:49.732]  Well, let's be clear.
[01:10:50.212 --> 01:10:56.855]  Every one of the juvenile facilities in Texas has had rape rooms and torture and it's been admitted.
[01:10:57.435 --> 01:11:03.358]  And the Texas Rangers tried to expose it and were told to shut up for over two years.
[01:11:04.478 --> 01:11:05.939]  And then the U.S.
[01:11:05.979 --> 01:11:16.623]  prosecutor wrote letters back to the state police office saying, hey, we don't know that this rape hurt them and it may have been consensual.
[01:11:17.651 --> 01:11:24.954]  Now, again, it's like the Attorney General writing memos saying they can torture small children with pliers.
[01:11:26.475 --> 01:11:34.319]  They are so evil, and they're in power, and they're on such power trips now, they just think they can be out in the open with it.
[01:11:34.539 --> 01:11:35.139]  You understand that?
[01:11:35.962 --> 01:11:40.624]  Yes, sir, and I just, it bothers me so much to see how fake and phony people are.
[01:11:41.044 --> 01:11:49.327]  At least when you give your opinion, if you're sad one day, I'm talking because I listen to you pretty regular, or you're mad, or you're happy, you show it and you sound that way.
[01:11:49.367 --> 01:11:55.889]  These people get up in front of people and they could have raped somebody a couple hours earlier, a child, and get up there and smile and act like the world's just perfect.
[01:11:56.089 --> 01:11:58.710]  And I don't know how anybody can live with themselves doing something like that.
[01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:01.831]  Well, they're evil people and they enjoy the power.
[01:12:02.591 --> 01:12:05.072]  And, uh, they are, um, they're
[01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:10.750]  People that wantonly are wicked are beyond reprieve.
[01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:11.991]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:12:12.511 --> 01:12:14.011]  Frank in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:12:14.051 --> 01:12:14.451]  Go ahead.
[01:12:14.471 --> 01:12:20.233]  Okay, we'll let him go.
[01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:22.434]  Ed in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:12:22.474 --> 01:12:22.814]  Welcome.
[01:12:23.194 --> 01:12:23.854]  Alex, how are you?
[01:12:23.914 --> 01:12:25.435]  Been here for around 10 years or so.
[01:12:25.455 --> 01:12:26.675]  Glad to get you.
[01:12:27.075 --> 01:12:31.857]  I am also an AFTF volunteer, a state coordinator here in New Jersey.
[01:12:33.097 --> 01:12:35.958]  I guess on behalf of the rest of the group, I would like to say thank you.
[01:12:38.853 --> 01:12:47.765]  You're talking about America, freedom to fascism, and I'm not griping at you because I love you to death and you're wonderful.
[01:12:48.346 --> 01:12:49.467]  I have the same problem.
[01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:52.912]  We tend to start talking in a closed shop.
[01:12:54.406 --> 01:12:56.747]  You know, as if we all know what we're talking about.
[01:12:56.767 --> 01:12:58.287]  We're all having private discussions.
[01:12:58.867 --> 01:13:02.928]  We have to remember that there are millions of people out there that listen to this show.
[01:13:03.408 --> 01:13:07.229]  Tens of thousands of new listeners at any one time, every day.
[01:13:07.829 --> 01:13:11.970]  And so we use all this nomenclature and, you know, all these anacronyms.
[01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:19.052]  And you also have to remember the general public's been so dumbed down, just as Orwell said they would be,
[01:13:19.841 --> 01:13:31.426]  That we need to always state things simply, so we can connect in to their semantic lexicon, and then we can build and expand their definitions there.
[01:13:31.886 --> 01:13:35.508]  To first state it simply, then you have to expand out.
[01:13:36.268 --> 01:13:36.829]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:13:36.909 --> 01:13:40.270]  And we need to get these people to see the movie, to go along with the same point.
[01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:42.931]  That is the ultimate goal.
[01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:48.654]  After listening to you, after all these years, I've come to realize there's really nothing too wild
[01:13:49.059 --> 01:13:49.579]  There's nothing.
[01:13:49.619 --> 01:13:50.920]  You can't be too paranoid.
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.181]  I believe anything can happen with these evil people.
[01:13:55.422 --> 01:13:59.804]  And the whole idea of cover-ups and timing.
[01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:07.367]  My initial gut feeling is this whole thing in the Iran waters is simply covering up for something else.
[01:14:07.548 --> 01:14:10.629]  They're putting our attention towards it and something else is going to happen.
[01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.750]  Any thoughts on that?
[01:14:14.855 --> 01:14:21.138]  Well, we had the ambassador and the former head of the Maritime Administration coming on, but we got the ball, we can't do it.
[01:14:23.359 --> 01:14:29.823]  Of course it staged, of course they rewrote the map, and then they tell the truth and say, well, the map says it's our water, but it isn't really.
[01:14:30.243 --> 01:14:31.724]  So it's like a fraud.
[01:14:31.764 --> 01:14:37.406]  It's like if you wrote a hot check and said that you had money in the bank, but you really didn't.
[01:14:37.747 --> 01:14:38.747]  I appreciate your call.
[01:14:39.327 --> 01:14:42.069]  By the way, I haven't really gotten into this.
[01:14:43.709 --> 01:14:45.811]  Today I haven't plugged any videos yet.
[01:14:46.812 --> 01:14:52.297]  You really should visit the Secure Online Video and Bookstore Shopping Cart at Infowars.com.
[01:14:52.778 --> 01:15:00.225]  If you go to Infowars.com, you can peruse all the great films and books we carry, not just the 15 films that I've made.
[01:15:00.665 --> 01:15:02.948]  America, Freedom to Fascism,
[01:15:03.548 --> 01:15:16.393]  This is a excellent documentary exposing the history of the private Federal Reserve, their collection agency, the IRS, how none of the money you pay the IRS goes to run the country, but goes to finance the debt to the private banks that own this nation.
[01:15:17.714 --> 01:15:20.095]  Then it gets into the North American Union, the implantable chip.
[01:15:20.835 --> 01:15:24.457]  It's a really good primer for the general public and it's very well done.
[01:15:25.977 --> 01:15:27.258]  You can get it for $9.95 at InfoWars.com.
[01:15:31.064 --> 01:15:37.149]  You can get American Freedom to Fascism as part of a discount combo package when you get it with Terror Storm for $9.95.
[01:15:39.071 --> 01:15:42.894]  And you can get some of my films that I've made as low as $5.95 like American Dictators.
[01:15:42.934 --> 01:15:43.514]  It's excellent.
[01:15:43.895 --> 01:15:45.116]  Exposing the Left-Right Paradigm.
[01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:50.518]  Uh, when you get it as part of package deals, there's a lot of specials up on InfoWars.com.
[01:15:50.978 --> 01:15:51.959]  So take advantage of those.
[01:15:51.979 --> 01:15:53.300]  They're call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:53.640]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.181]  Let's go ahead and talk to David.
[01:15:55.202 --> 01:15:56.743]  David, where are you calling us from today?
[01:15:56.843 --> 01:15:57.403]  Whitefish, Montana.
[01:15:57.423 --> 01:15:58.484]  Life to the resistance.
[01:15:58.504 --> 01:15:58.944]  Greetings, Mr. Alex.
[01:16:13.192 --> 01:16:14.853]  Uh, I'd like to say a couple of things.
[01:16:14.894 --> 01:16:23.360]  With Rosie O'Donnell, Jesus, the way Jesus saved the adulteress' life is with the truth.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:26.222]  And she went off and spread the truth.
[01:16:26.762 --> 01:16:29.204]  And just let the sinners show themselves.
[01:16:29.324 --> 01:16:30.725]  Let them throw their rocks.
[01:16:30.766 --> 01:16:32.887]  And then we know who the evil ones are.
[01:16:32.907 --> 01:16:36.830]  That's the same thing that, what Rosie, is happening with Rosie.
[01:16:37.391 --> 01:16:41.714]  And then, uh, I think we need a call to action to this cloning the,
[01:16:42.617 --> 01:16:57.360]  Human embryo and then taking the stem cell of that cloned embryo and putting it into a sheep embryo and then putting that embryo into a mama sheep and the little baby sheep comes out and it's got a human heart in it.
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:59.280]  And then they're doing it with chimps.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.481]  They're putting stem cells of the brain into chimps.
[01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:04.541]  Do we?
[01:17:04.981 --> 01:17:08.102]  And then we wonder why they want to crush America.
[01:17:08.182 --> 01:17:09.962]  This is like Mengele stuff, man.
[01:17:10.935 --> 01:17:12.176]  Power to you, man.
[01:17:12.316 --> 01:17:14.276]  I hope it gets through.
[01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:16.977]  The truth is always going to prevail.
[01:17:17.677 --> 01:17:19.798]  Well, God bless you, my friend, and power to what you're doing.
[01:17:19.838 --> 01:17:20.638]  All of us together.
[01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:21.619]  I mean, we are brothers.
[01:17:21.659 --> 01:17:22.419]  We are sisters.
[01:17:23.059 --> 01:17:24.760]  In this fight, we're part of a family.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:31.922]  We won't individually live on, but liberty and freedom and resistance to dehumanization will live forever.
[01:17:32.983 --> 01:17:35.383]  And that's what's so beautiful about it, my friend.
[01:17:35.904 --> 01:17:37.124]  Through the Spirit.
[01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:41.512]  That set the truth free through that adulterous woman.
[01:17:42.072 --> 01:17:45.194]  And through that we all are the sinners, man.
[01:17:45.374 --> 01:17:50.197]  And we'll see the real evil ones that are trying to throw the rocks against the truth.
[01:17:51.018 --> 01:17:53.559]  And this is going to send rock chakras.
[01:17:54.079 --> 01:17:56.781]  And then I would like to say something about the English, man.
[01:17:56.801 --> 01:17:59.222]  The English are known for good fighting.
[01:17:59.262 --> 01:18:00.683]  I think they punked out.
[01:18:00.723 --> 01:18:02.204]  They should have fought to the end.
[01:18:02.924 --> 01:18:03.785]  They could have...
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.421]  They could have held their ground, but they didn't.
[01:18:06.641 --> 01:18:13.584]  They're just subjects to a monarchy that thinks that they could use their subjects as fodder.
[01:18:13.604 --> 01:18:22.188]  Well, look, they just sent that patrol boat into Iranian waters, out of Iraqi waters, claiming they were Iraqi waters, to get them captured.
[01:18:22.208 --> 01:18:26.349]  So they're just average people that, you know, join the military for a paycheck.
[01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:30.251]  That's one reason they blow out economies, is so you're forced to join their system.
[01:18:30.551 --> 01:18:32.272]  And it's only going to get worse, it's not going to get better.
[01:18:32.839 --> 01:18:33.620]  Good to hear from you.
[01:18:34.462 --> 01:18:36.465]  I'm glad they didn't open fire on the Iranians.
[01:18:37.186 --> 01:18:38.648]  Because that's what the globalists want.
[01:18:39.309 --> 01:18:41.272]  They want to get a provocation going.
[01:18:41.934 --> 01:18:42.655]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:42.675 --> 01:18:43.115]  Stay with me.
[01:18:54.250 --> 01:19:05.518]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:19:05.738 --> 01:19:12.183]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:19:12.443 --> 01:19:13.083]  We're good to go!
[01:19:37.159 --> 01:19:38.400]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:04.201]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:04.401 --> 01:20:07.143]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:07.203 --> 01:20:08.303]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:09.644 --> 01:20:14.247]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:15.167 --> 01:20:22.432]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:20:23.432 --> 01:20:26.494]  Midas Resources is offering the red buck and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[01:20:28.627 --> 01:20:32.108]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:20:33.068 --> 01:20:34.348]  Call for your copy today.
[01:20:34.588 --> 01:20:36.809]  It's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:37.849 --> 01:20:43.690]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:20:44.411 --> 01:20:44.811]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:44.851 --> 01:20:45.051]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.466 --> 01:20:53.047]  It's a fact.
[01:20:53.247 --> 01:20:57.670]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:20:58.010 --> 01:21:03.214]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:21:03.494 --> 01:21:06.696]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[01:21:06.956 --> 01:21:09.859]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt.
[01:21:09.939 --> 01:21:14.102]  And unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:21:14.442 --> 01:21:21.607]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:21:21.807 --> 01:21:21.987]  I think?
[01:21:52.227 --> 01:21:54.829]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[01:21:54.989 --> 01:22:01.134]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[01:22:01.274 --> 01:22:10.421]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.
[01:22:10.641 --> 01:22:11.862]  It's called SlenderFX.
[01:22:12.122 --> 01:22:20.128]  SlenderFX opens the door for a healthy metabolism, permanent weight loss, reduction of low thyroid symptoms, and considerably increased energy by helping to balance
[01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:20.428]  I think so.
[01:22:36.289 --> 01:22:38.510]  I was sittin' in traffic listenin' to the radio
[01:23:06.858 --> 01:23:10.681]  Alright, I'm down here in Austin, Texas.
[01:23:10.801 --> 01:23:17.285]  The network with the satellite uplinks is up in Minneapolis, St.
[01:23:17.666 --> 01:23:18.446]  Paul, Minnesota.
[01:23:32.197 --> 01:23:38.121]  Looks like I'll be able to phone patch the Ambassador directly into my board here in Austin, Texas.
[01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:43.204]  And we'll see if after 30 minutes of attempts, he's able to get in with us.
[01:23:44.685 --> 01:23:51.489]  Paul Watson, in the last few months, has told us that he has to try about 20 times to be able to get into the network.
[01:23:52.029 --> 01:23:55.472]  And that's even on regular phone lines that aren't digital or on T1s.
[01:23:55.532 --> 01:23:59.374]  So, I'm sure it's all just an accident.
[01:24:00.363 --> 01:24:18.955]  We'll see if the Ambassador is able to get on with us in the next segment, because he did head up the British Maritime Administration, and he is an expert on this, and he's the one that pointed it out, and now the one in Guardian, the British government is saying, okay, they may have made mistakes, they may have been in their waters.
[01:24:19.515 --> 01:24:20.616]  But that's not on the news.
[01:24:21.216 --> 01:24:22.797]  I mean, that's not on the national television.
[01:24:22.837 --> 01:24:24.078]  Tony Blair is not saying that.
[01:24:26.164 --> 01:24:27.425]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:24:27.485 --> 01:24:29.165]  This is very, very important.
[01:24:29.505 --> 01:24:34.807]  He also went public about the torture going on in Uzbekistan when he was the ambassador there from Britain.
[01:24:36.348 --> 01:24:44.631]  But let me go back to Rosie O'Donnell here because again, we're not just going on and on about this because she's a celebrity.
[01:24:45.692 --> 01:24:48.913]  We're going on and on about it because as we said three weeks ago before this broke,
[01:24:49.571 --> 01:25:16.515]  that they will attack her they won't be able to control themselves it will cause a national debate to intensify maybe even tenfold about 9-11 truth when we're already moving forward by leaps and bounds so very very exciting things are happening today and that's why I'm asking you because they're really they're calling for her firing
[01:25:17.478 --> 01:25:20.178]  They're calling for her arrest, they're calling for her murder.
[01:25:21.079 --> 01:25:23.099]  On national television, they're calling for her death.
[01:25:23.679 --> 01:25:25.219]  MSNBC, Scarborough country.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:32.981]  And O'Reilly's calling for her arrest, and calling for Mark Cuban's arrest, and calling for Charlie Sheen's arrest.
[01:25:34.781 --> 01:25:38.622]  And you can't imagine the things behind the scenes that these people go through to go public.
[01:25:40.482 --> 01:25:47.243]  So, in this national debate, we need to force this out in the open now, that when it came out, with this pervert scandal,
[01:25:48.963 --> 01:25:49.824]  Very perverted.
[01:25:49.844 --> 01:25:57.109]  You know, admitted, coming to the woman, constantly calling her, talking about all sorts of just really gross things.
[01:25:57.270 --> 01:26:00.392]  Just creepy to read those transcripts.
[01:26:01.573 --> 01:26:04.655]  There, of course, were recordings of it as well, but those didn't get out on the news.
[01:26:05.336 --> 01:26:18.586]  And O'Reilly started playing ball with the New World Order even more then, but it turns out he had the view, threatened through their executives, that I'm going to personally go after Rosie and I'm going to personally go after everybody if they talk about this on their show.
[01:26:19.355 --> 01:26:34.260]  Well, he's the guy, when you call into his show and mildly disagree with him, he says, that's it, we've got your phone number, we're going to have the police come after you, and then the people think it's a joke, and Fox Security calls them up and starts threatening them.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.421]  I mean, this guy is a bully.
[01:26:38.221 --> 01:26:40.962]  He is a thug, and he's a criminal.
[01:26:41.042 --> 01:26:42.582]  Bill O'Reilly is a criminal.
[01:26:43.103 --> 01:26:47.604]  It is criminal to call for people to be arrested for their free speech.
[01:26:48.394 --> 01:26:54.058]  It is criminal what he did to that professor in Florida with no criminal record.
[01:26:54.098 --> 01:26:55.939]  He got up on air and said, I think you're a terrorist.
[01:26:56.299 --> 01:26:57.120]  You should be arrested.
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:58.601]  I'm calling the FBI on you.
[01:26:59.121 --> 01:27:04.225]  They did arrest him, and the guy spent two years in jail and was found not guilty by a jury.
[01:27:07.007 --> 01:27:07.307]  Okay?
[01:27:07.767 --> 01:27:10.949]  That's how these people operate.
[01:27:13.551 --> 01:27:16.413]  Last time I heard, though, they were just keeping him in jail even though he was found not guilty.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.141]  I heard his wife's going around to the interviews.
[01:27:22.161 --> 01:27:22.882]  I ought to get them on.
[01:27:23.282 --> 01:27:25.704]  The point is, this guy is a monster!
[01:27:27.185 --> 01:27:30.087]  But he's indicative of what we're talking about.
[01:27:30.767 --> 01:27:46.318]  You know, they're either on Oxycontin, and they're out of the country, you know, visiting the whores, or they're writing books about their gay lovers, as one big national host did, and then getting on air saying the, you know, queers should be killed.
[01:27:48.479 --> 01:27:49.320]  That's his word.
[01:27:50.863 --> 01:27:53.705]  These people are sick!
[01:27:54.065 --> 01:27:55.126]  Take the whole White House!
[01:27:55.886 --> 01:27:58.908]  They're a bunch of murdering perverts, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:27:59.589 --> 01:28:00.870]  They're all sick!
[01:28:01.710 --> 01:28:03.411]  They're unbelievable!
[01:28:05.072 --> 01:28:08.975]  And I just hope you go to PrisonPlanet.com
[01:28:10.322 --> 01:28:22.330]  And get this story, and get it out to every talk station, every newspaper, every conservative, liberal, libertarian blog, and say, are we going to stand for his bullying and intimidation?
[01:28:22.691 --> 01:28:27.094]  He needs to be fired for calling for people to be arrested for their speech.
[01:28:28.274 --> 01:28:29.395]  And I'm saying don't fire him.
[01:28:29.855 --> 01:28:33.278]  Let him still work up there at that Defense Department News Channel, Fox News.
[01:28:34.158 --> 01:28:37.120]  Let everybody, because I think he does more harm than good.
[01:28:37.621 --> 01:28:39.302]  That guy is a complete spectacle.
[01:28:42.978 --> 01:28:43.899]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.359 --> 01:28:46.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.901 --> 01:28:49.663]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.245 --> 01:28:54.246]  How are you feeling today?

[01:29:41.991 --> 01:29:42.752]  I don't know.
[01:30:07.312 --> 01:30:07.772]  I think so.
[01:30:26.451 --> 01:30:27.672]  We're good to go.
[01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:58.813]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[01:30:58.873 --> 01:30:59.614]  have diabetes.
[01:30:59.934 --> 01:31:06.879]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[01:31:07.039 --> 01:31:11.562]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[01:31:11.762 --> 01:31:14.584]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[01:32:00.856 --> 01:32:16.608]  I come from the land of the ice and snow From the midnight town where the heart breaks through The amber of the gold
[01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:40.052]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, and we have him with us.
[01:32:42.234 --> 01:32:46.056]  After a bit of difficulties, we're very honored to have him return to the broadcast.
[01:32:46.476 --> 01:32:59.185]  He's the former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, and he also headed up their British Naval Arm, I guess their Maritime Administration, very important post.
[01:33:00.254 --> 01:33:05.875]  And he has written extensively on his blog, and this broke all over the U.S.
[01:33:05.935 --> 01:33:08.256]  news, the alternative news, and the mainstream news.
[01:33:08.276 --> 01:33:18.258]  It was in some of the major newspapers over the weekend, and so he is very well suited and qualified to speak on these issues here on the broadcast.
[01:33:18.638 --> 01:33:20.579]  Last Friday, we talked about
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:25.884]  The fact that the British had manufactured the Gulf Maritime Border Map.
[01:33:26.305 --> 01:33:33.793]  And again, this would be like if you suddenly took five feet of your neighbor's yard and moved the fence line over and you claim that it's your land, but it's not.
[01:33:34.774 --> 01:33:41.441]  But to simplify this for us is a gentleman who is an expert on this subject, Craig Murray.
[01:33:42.262 --> 01:33:46.744]  And he's Britain's outspoken Ambassador to Central Asian Republic of Uzbekistan.
[01:33:46.764 --> 01:33:57.530]  Craig Murray helped expose various human rights abuses by the U.S.-funded regime of Islam Karamov.
[01:33:57.970 --> 01:34:02.033]  He is now a prominent critic of Western policy in the region.
[01:34:02.593 --> 01:34:04.754]  And thank you so much for spending time with us, sir.
[01:34:05.454 --> 01:34:06.575]  It's very good of you to invite me.
[01:34:07.552 --> 01:34:18.437]  Now, you've got a bio here that is several pages of tiny print long, but let's get right into when you headed up the Maritime Administration.
[01:34:19.558 --> 01:34:23.760]  Yeah, I was responsible for territorial sea claims.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:32.884]  Both negotiated our own territorial sea boundaries, for example, between the United Kingdom and Ireland, and the Channel Islands and France.
[01:34:34.618 --> 01:34:40.802]  And also for maritime claims by other nations, for, you know, performing our view on those claims.
[01:34:42.544 --> 01:34:57.615]  And also during the first Gulf War, I worked in a unit with the Royal Navy, in a secret unit, which was actually underground in London, where we worked 24 hours a day, enforcing the arms embargo against Iraq.
[01:34:57.696 --> 01:35:01.198]  So I was in real time responsible for
[01:35:02.788 --> 01:35:07.053]  I'm sure there are several people who know the stuff as well as me, but I don't suppose
[01:35:27.006 --> 01:35:31.371]  Well, I tell you, we're blessed to have you because you went public on serious U.S.
[01:35:31.671 --> 01:35:37.617]  funding of brutal torture, where they literally boiled people alive over Uzbekistan, as you exposed valiantly.
[01:35:38.317 --> 01:35:47.106]  And now, to have had you be the former head of the Maritime Administration, and then before that be involved in secret operations.
[01:35:48.547 --> 01:36:03.076]  Boil it down for laymen out there, going over the maps, going over the other experts that are concurring with you, what I get is that you've got this river, this open waterway, this key navigation channel, and that previously the kind of
[01:36:05.047 --> 01:36:23.239]  Armistice or truce they had was 50-50 going out so many miles into the Gulf and that the British just suddenly changed the map going into disputed Iranian waters and so this is all really a big hoax and a dog-and-pony show.
[01:36:23.419 --> 01:36:24.580]  Can you boil it down for us?
[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:26.521]  Yeah.
[01:36:26.581 --> 01:36:31.364]  What you've got is you've got two huge rivers, the Tigris and the Euphates, coming to a
[01:36:32.074 --> 01:36:36.977]  A confluent then flowing as a single unit, the Shattal Arab, until it reaches the sea.
[01:36:38.158 --> 01:36:44.041]  And once it reaches the sea, it branches out into a delta where you've got a lot of different channels.
[01:36:44.101 --> 01:36:55.728]  You can think of it, if you like, as, you know, for Americans, if you think of something like the Mississippi Delta, and imagine that you've got two countries having their border in the middle of the Mississippi Delta.
[01:36:57.149 --> 01:37:01.552]  And what happened was, in effect, they've sorted out the border
[01:37:03.215 --> 01:37:07.838]  In 1975, all the way down to the sea.
[01:37:07.858 --> 01:37:12.262]  Deciding on which channel of the river it takes.
[01:37:12.582 --> 01:37:15.504]  And they sorted it right down to the sea.
[01:37:16.145 --> 01:37:17.186]  They sorted the border out.
[01:37:17.946 --> 01:37:28.635]  Now then, whether that agreement still exists is a little up to open to dispute, because it was meant to be renegotiated every 10 years, it says that in the treaty, and it never has been.
[01:37:29.523 --> 01:37:30.263]  I don't think so.
[01:37:51.164 --> 01:37:54.446]  These incidents happened out in the sea, a few miles off the river.
[01:37:54.486 --> 01:38:05.451]  No, I understand, but I'm talking about drawing that red line out of the river, out into the sea, with the maps, it shows the British boat in Iranian waters.
[01:38:06.091 --> 01:38:19.898]  Yeah, but no, that red line that's been drawn going out to sea, on that map produced by the British government, that map just was produced by the British government, that red line going out to sea has no authority whatsoever.
[01:38:21.198 --> 01:38:21.398]  Now,
[01:38:46.966 --> 01:38:59.194]  There are several maps because other maps have been put out, and I'm talking about the one, I think I should dig it out here, where they simply drew a line from the middle of the channel where the two rivers merge and come out to the sea.
[01:39:01.169 --> 01:39:01.790]  Well, you can't tell.
[01:39:01.810 --> 01:39:03.151]  It's the simple answer to that.
[01:39:03.211 --> 01:39:06.493]  Because the boundary has to be negotiated between the
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:30.600]  Between the two.
[01:39:30.981 --> 01:39:36.864]  It's true that if you look at the map they produced, the red line coming out is just nonsense.
[01:39:36.884 --> 01:39:38.345]  They just invented that red line.
[01:39:38.485 --> 01:39:39.346]  Ignore the red line.
[01:39:39.866 --> 01:39:46.710]  If you then take the coordinates they give to the ship, it's true that that appears to be closer to the Iranian mainland than the Iraqi mainland.
[01:39:47.251 --> 01:39:52.754]  That would indicate, other things being equal, that this could well be Iranian waters.
[01:39:53.535 --> 01:39:58.998]  But it's more complicated than that, because when you negotiate a boundary line of territorial waters,
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:02.242]  A lot of things count.
[01:40:02.562 --> 01:40:04.163]  For example, sandbanks count.
[01:40:05.124 --> 01:40:11.369]  Even a sandbank that only appears at low tide, that can count.
[01:40:12.309 --> 01:40:22.077]  And, you know, rocks, uninhabited rocks in the sea can count, in terms of what you count as land for drawing the line.
[01:40:22.457 --> 01:40:23.878]  And this is terribly complicated.
[01:40:23.938 --> 01:40:27.241]  When you negotiate and sit and have your negotiations with another country,
[01:40:28.307 --> 01:40:34.089]  It took the United States and Canada hundreds of years, literally, to agree to a ban.
[01:40:34.129 --> 01:40:39.951]  I don't even think that's completed, because you argue like mad over which bits of rock and which bits of sand ought to be allowed to camp.
[01:40:40.311 --> 01:40:51.895]  So the truth of the matter is that the British government is talking complete rubbish, and no one can say... Now doesn't the United States declare more territorial waters than any other nation?
[01:40:54.556 --> 01:40:55.517]  The United States
[01:40:57.519 --> 01:41:16.621]  I think that there had been a major history of difficulty with the United States with maritime law, but much of that was actually cleared up under the Clinton administration and the United States position.
[01:41:17.370 --> 01:41:26.893]  It's one area where things actually, you may feel there aren't many, but it's certainly one area where things got much better under the Clinton administration.
[01:41:27.013 --> 01:41:34.476]  A lot of the United States accepted difficulties they were causing in the world in the field of maritime law were tidied up then.
[01:41:35.291 --> 01:41:46.836]  Alright, to be specific, we're interviewing Craig Murray, former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, and there are so many notes here in your bio of where you worked in maritime positions.
[01:41:47.177 --> 01:41:51.018]  Can you again specify the two key areas?
[01:41:52.659 --> 01:42:03.104]  Yeah, well, as I say, I'm particularly an expert at both negotiating maritime boundaries and at patrolling these Gulf waters.
[01:42:03.789 --> 01:42:07.851]  And what I'm saying is that beyond any shadow of a doubt, there is no boundary here.
[01:42:08.011 --> 01:42:08.952]  It's never been agreed.
[01:42:09.012 --> 01:42:13.894]  So nobody can say if this incident took place in Iraqi waters or Iranian waters.
[01:42:14.414 --> 01:42:21.918]  But, you know, when Tony Blair said he's utterly certain these were in Iraqi waters, he's being fatuous.
[01:42:22.298 --> 01:42:25.480]  Because you just don't know if a boundary's never been drawn.
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.521]  How do you say which side of it you are?
[01:42:30.563 --> 01:42:33.344]  So why do you think the Iranians grabbed the sailors?
[01:42:35.855 --> 01:42:58.834]  My guess is, and it can't be any more than a guess, that the Iranians did feel that they went too far across to the Iranian side because, you know, where there is no boundary of greed, then it's just common sense for people to act with a certain caution when you're in what you know to be the disputed area.
[01:42:59.774 --> 01:43:04.078]  So we were boarding ships, we were boarding ships, you know, getting
[01:43:04.648 --> 01:43:32.428]  Well, when you were commanding which ships, and ordering which ships would be searched and where, and when you were involved in negotiating these disputes, where this ship was interdicted by the Iranians, would you at that time have considered that to be too far for the ship to go?
[01:43:34.696 --> 01:43:45.299]  We would certainly not interdict any ship which there was a very good argument within the Danian waters basically.
[01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:47.039]  And so there was a good argument.
[01:43:47.799 --> 01:43:53.581]  I mean, when you were commanding these very type operations, you wouldn't have sent that boat there.
[01:43:54.961 --> 01:43:56.461]  I mean, did they go a half mile?
[01:43:56.481 --> 01:43:57.802]  Did they go a mile too far?
[01:43:59.102 --> 01:44:02.783]  I mean, I wouldn't use the term commanding.
[01:44:02.823 --> 01:44:07.905]  I was giving the political clearance, you know, the Navy were commanding their own ships.
[01:44:08.145 --> 01:44:11.107]  I understand, when you were giving the clearance for the military to make the command.
[01:44:11.927 --> 01:44:20.330]  No, I think we would have viewed, well, we would certainly have viewed this as in the disputed area where we wouldn't go in and interfere.
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:31.387]  So there's a no man's land that both sides, just like with North Korea and South Korea with the demilitarized zone, there's an area that, hey, you know, let's not get too close to the Iranians.
[01:44:31.747 --> 01:44:32.508]  Yeah.
[01:44:33.028 --> 01:44:35.170]  Do the Iranians stay in their area most of the time?
[01:44:36.365 --> 01:44:39.628]  Yeah, by and large they do.
[01:44:40.209 --> 01:44:55.843]  Let me ask you, when you were, what years, I know you headed up the Maritime Administration, but when you were actually in the bunker running the operations there in the Gulf, or giving political clearance to the military to do that, making the calls, did you
[01:44:59.037 --> 01:45:01.257]  Find that the Iranians were looking for trouble?
[01:45:01.337 --> 01:45:06.638]  I mean, how were they viewed by the officers and by the military personnel that were interfacing with them?
[01:45:08.699 --> 01:45:11.779]  They were fine.
[01:45:12.499 --> 01:45:17.040]  In my time, we didn't have any major incidents with the Iranians over this kind of operation.
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:18.340]  So they weren't looking for trouble?
[01:45:18.741 --> 01:45:22.221]  They weren't looking for trouble, and nor were we.
[01:45:22.801 --> 01:45:26.602]  Because the truth of the matter is that if the thing is going into Iraq,
[01:45:27.543 --> 01:45:35.766]  And if you're worried about, you know, here we, um, you know, we were saying that we're worried that this vessel was smuggling cars into Iraq.
[01:45:35.886 --> 01:45:40.288]  But frankly, what the hell business that is of ours is something I don't understand anyway.
[01:45:40.328 --> 01:45:46.630]  But, but actually official explanation, we felt this vessel was, was intercepting cars into, was taking cars into Iraq.
[01:45:46.670 --> 01:45:49.031]  Well, how dare those Iraqis have some cars?
[01:45:49.231 --> 01:45:52.792]  Yeah, well, um, and you know, are the sanctions still on?
[01:45:52.853 --> 01:45:55.714]  Because they're, they're acting like with all this searching, they're still on.
[01:45:57.426 --> 01:46:12.657]  They were, what the British MOD claim, is that they were working in terms of their UN mandate to support the government of Iraq, so they were supporting them to prevent smuggling, and supporting them therefore to collect vehicle excise duty.
[01:46:12.677 --> 01:46:17.080]  So why the collection of vehicle excise duty has anything to do with the Royal Navy?
[01:46:17.841 --> 01:46:22.544]  This gets into the realms of the completely incredible, but that's the actual story.
[01:46:22.564 --> 01:46:25.927]  So that rings to you, being inside this, is pure bull?
[01:46:27.078 --> 01:46:29.630]  Um, yeah, I mean...
[01:46:30.569 --> 01:46:35.612]  Whatever they were doing, I very much doubt they were really concerned about collecting vehicles.
[01:46:36.593 --> 01:46:37.794]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:46:37.814 --> 01:46:43.678]  The mothership was very close and didn't do anything.
[01:46:43.698 --> 01:46:46.680]  A. Why did that happen?
[01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:50.102]  What did that captain know that the rubber boat didn't know?
[01:46:50.622 --> 01:46:58.628]  And B. Do you think the captain of the ship for that mission was given an order to send that patrol boat into that area
[01:46:59.348 --> 01:47:03.351]  And do you think Tim Downing Street may have been involved trying to create a provocation?
[01:47:04.773 --> 01:47:05.733]  I wouldn't go that far.
[01:47:06.814 --> 01:47:18.884]  I like to try to stick to what I know and what I can explain to people from my own knowledge of the area and what we do and not get into ideas of why someone might have done something when I don't really know that's what happened.
[01:47:18.924 --> 01:47:19.164]  Sure.
[01:47:19.764 --> 01:47:22.847]  Do we know how close the HMS Cornwall was to the rubber boat?
[01:47:23.447 --> 01:47:27.390]  Well, I've seen estimations everywhere between two and six miles.
[01:47:28.956 --> 01:47:42.381]  But of course, these things were moving around and those other boats can do 30 knots, which is what, over 50 miles an hour.
[01:47:43.081 --> 01:47:50.184]  But it was certainly some way away, but it's still, I mean, if you're two or six miles away out at sea, you're still within eyesight.
[01:47:50.964 --> 01:47:54.746]  And the other thing is, which, I mean, I absolutely do not understand this,
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:00.262]  HMS Cornwall is an absolute state-of-the-art naval vessel.
[01:48:00.602 --> 01:48:06.645]  HMS Cornwall can see an Iraqi patrol boat move 30 miles away.
[01:48:07.606 --> 01:48:10.347]  I mean, electronically see.
[01:48:10.827 --> 01:48:22.193]  How on earth HMS Cornwall would not know... I mean, it would have seen those Iraqi patrol boats coming the whole way towards its rubber boats.
[01:48:22.533 --> 01:48:24.374]  I cannot understand how it can have happened.
[01:48:26.301 --> 01:48:30.463]  But, you know, it couldn't just warn them to come back.
[01:48:30.523 --> 01:48:34.165]  The official explanation is there was some problem with radio communication.
[01:48:34.685 --> 01:48:35.925]  Well, you know, this is the Navy.
[01:48:36.025 --> 01:48:37.186]  They can fire flares.
[01:48:37.226 --> 01:48:39.687]  They have lots of different ways of communicating.
[01:48:39.847 --> 01:48:42.849]  So there's something very, very strange about that.
[01:48:44.677 --> 01:48:45.398]  Absolutely.
[01:48:45.418 --> 01:48:56.868]  Now the London Guardian is reporting in the headline, Iran snubs UK olive branch, but they don't give you the meat of the story until the last paragraph.
[01:48:57.757 --> 01:49:03.859]  And it says, but the Ministry of Defense hinted for the first time it may have made mistakes surrounding the incident.
[01:49:04.299 --> 01:49:12.081]  An inquiry has been commissioned to explore navigational issues around the kidnapping and aspects of maritime law.
[01:49:12.461 --> 01:49:14.902]  So we now see a serious softening there.
[01:49:14.922 --> 01:49:19.683]  Is Tony Blair worried that his spin is going to unravel?
[01:49:20.503 --> 01:49:23.204]  I think to some extent.
[01:49:23.544 --> 01:49:25.645]  I think they thought that they could just
[01:49:26.494 --> 01:49:28.015]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[01:49:28.075 --> 01:49:32.737]  I want to ask you when we get back what the British would do if the Iranians were in the Iraqi waters.
[01:49:32.757 --> 01:49:33.177]  Stay with us.
[01:49:56.019 --> 01:50:01.441]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.822 --> 01:50:09.445]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.177 --> 01:50:17.221]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.622 --> 01:50:29.029]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.349 --> 01:50:32.931]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.311 --> 01:50:35.252]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.592 --> 01:50:39.435]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.021 --> 01:50:58.244]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.384 --> 01:51:06.489]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:06.729 --> 01:51:13.793]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:13.973 --> 01:51:15.253]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:15.333 --> 01:51:21.214]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.414 --> 01:51:26.495]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.615 --> 01:51:35.477]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:51:35.757 --> 01:51:38.918]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:52:48.904 --> 01:52:51.546]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:53:09.349 --> 01:53:14.771]  Ambassador Craig Murray will be spending another five minutes with us into the next hour before our next guest joins us.
[01:53:15.911 --> 01:53:25.194]  So we can talk a little bit about torture in his beaker stand and his new book that's out that sent shockwaves around the world last year and hopefully saved some lives.
[01:53:25.214 --> 01:53:28.535]  In fact, without a doubt, I'm sure it did.
[01:53:28.575 --> 01:53:35.997]  It really embarrassed the Stone Age, really Byzantine regime over there.
[01:53:37.038 --> 01:53:47.908]  But Craig, getting back to the standoff, the quote, hostage crisis, obviously they're nice, you know, naval commandos, they're nice, you know, young people.
[01:53:48.549 --> 01:53:49.710]  Nobody wants them to be hurt.
[01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:51.751]  Nobody wants them to be used to start World War III.
[01:53:52.992 --> 01:54:02.754]  But what would have happened if Iran would have been that far over out of the no-man's zone into the edge of Iraqi waters?
[01:54:02.874 --> 01:54:06.794]  What would the British or the US or the Iraqis, what would they have done?
[01:54:06.814 --> 01:54:14.456]  Well, I mean, if they were just over in their patrol craft, we'd probably, initially, we'd just warm them back.
[01:54:15.036 --> 01:54:18.997]  And we wouldn't immediately dip in and arrest them.
[01:54:19.037 --> 01:54:21.717]  The British Navy wouldn't ordinarily.
[01:54:22.521 --> 01:54:31.363]  As you know, the Americans have been arresting the Danians in Iraq on land quite willy-nilly.
[01:54:31.703 --> 01:54:43.466]  And so you would say, with your ambassador skills, or diplomatic skills, and I'm not talking about words in your mouth, but what I'm getting from you here is, this is kind of tit-for-tat, but the British are paying for what the Americans have been doing?
[01:54:44.386 --> 01:54:48.187]  I think there might be an element of that in it.
[01:54:48.627 --> 01:54:50.668]  The other point is, of course, that we
[01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:59.527]  You know, it wasn't just that our boats were according to the Iranians, in what the Iranians consider their waters.
[01:54:59.547 --> 01:55:02.750]  They were also molesting and searching.
[01:55:03.130 --> 01:55:05.452]  But they were actually boarding vessels there.
[01:55:05.842 --> 01:55:10.705]  And if Iranians boarded vessels in Iraqi waters, then certainly we'd arrest them, yeah.
[01:55:11.046 --> 01:55:13.928]  Oh, so, oh, now that's a clear distinction then.
[01:55:14.368 --> 01:55:24.675]  So if Iranians came across into the edge of the Iraqi waters out of no man's land, and were boarding at machine gun point vessels, then the British would probably arrest.
[01:55:25.275 --> 01:55:26.376]  Yeah, well, I'm sure, yeah.
[01:55:28.082 --> 01:55:30.384]  And do you think Iran's being reasonable?
[01:55:30.744 --> 01:55:38.010]  Then saying, look, just admit you were in our waters, or admit that it was at least disputed and we'll let them go, and Blair says, never!
[01:55:38.110 --> 01:55:39.150]  I shall never do it!
[01:55:40.091 --> 01:55:45.315]  My view is that neither Iran nor Blair is being reasonable.
[01:55:45.335 --> 01:55:46.996]  I think both sides are being unreasonable.
[01:55:47.436 --> 01:55:49.198]  And I think there's a reason for that too, you know.
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:56.223]  Both Blair and Iranian leadership, they're both very unpopular at home at the moment.
[01:55:57.229 --> 01:56:03.733]  And there's nothing like a good bit of patriotic saber-rattling to get the voters on your side.
[01:56:03.833 --> 01:56:04.374]  Exactly.
[01:56:04.414 --> 01:56:21.084]  In fact, most analysts, top analysts in the CIA and MI6, of course you're aware of this, have been in the news saying if they attack Iran, that's going to strengthen the hardline mullahs, who are just a few years maximum of being overthrown by their huge, young, trendy population.
[01:56:21.124 --> 01:56:24.766]  I mean, their days are numbered, unless we make them become more hardline.
[01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:26.371]  Yeah, no, I think that's good.
[01:56:26.731 --> 01:56:39.422]  And I think the trouble is, and this is all horrible for the sailors and marine, but both governments, both the Iranian and the British governments are getting a popularity boost out of the crisis.
[01:56:39.482 --> 01:56:44.426]  So I think instead of, you know, what we should have been saying is, look, these are disputed waters.
[01:56:44.566 --> 01:56:46.328]  We acknowledge we were in disputed waters.
[01:56:46.728 --> 01:56:49.571]  We did not intend to be in Iranian waters.
[01:56:50.872 --> 01:56:51.973]  Please can we have our people back?
[01:56:52.848 --> 01:56:54.671]  We need to open the question, because it's what they were.
[01:56:54.691 --> 01:56:55.812]  They were disputed waters.
[01:56:55.892 --> 01:56:57.054]  No one can say who's boss.
[01:56:57.074 --> 01:56:58.796]  Well, 10 Downing Street isn't stupid.
[01:56:59.116 --> 01:57:04.583]  So are you saying that clearly the British government is trying to exacerbate?
[01:57:04.603 --> 01:57:08.608]  I think that this government has prioritized
[01:57:10.015 --> 01:57:13.477]  Okay, you were trying to make a point when I interrupted with that.
[01:57:13.497 --> 01:57:20.360]  Stay there, we'll be back in 70 seconds, final segment, with the ambassador from England, and then we're going to continue.
[01:57:33.288 --> 01:57:37.530]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:38.011]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.151 --> 01:57:38.771]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:38.991 --> 01:57:42.333]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:44.274 --> 01:57:46.615]  You want answers?
[01:57:46.756 --> 01:57:47.896]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.980 --> 01:58:00.602]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.163 --> 01:58:05.265]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.847 --> 01:58:09.088]  Well, he's done it all.
[01:58:09.208 --> 01:58:15.552]  He's been the High Commissioner and Assistant High Commissioner in different areas.
[01:58:15.612 --> 01:58:19.254]  He's headed up the British Maritime Administration.
[01:58:21.375 --> 01:58:24.177]  He worked in secret operations, clearing
[01:58:25.397 --> 01:58:40.005]  uh... military uh... boarding of vessels in this exact disputed area and he said without a doubt is the iranians have been that far over disputed waters up in the edge of iraqi waters boarding ships they would have been arrested
[01:58:40.786 --> 01:58:48.350]  And we are honored to have the former ambassador from Uzbekistan, the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, with us.
[01:58:48.431 --> 01:58:50.732]  Any other points in the four minutes we've got left, sir?
[01:58:51.052 --> 01:59:04.640]  You want to add about the hostage crisis, close quote, and where you think this is going and leading as it strengthens both of the oppressive regimes, and you can say that about Bulgaria's getting more and more thuggish,
[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:09.001]  Nothing compared to Ahmadinejad, but where do you see this going?
[01:59:09.021 --> 01:59:13.902]  And then recap for us your book and what it covers.
[01:59:14.762 --> 01:59:33.125]  Yeah, well I worry greatly about the captive problem, because as I say, I don't see enough time that either government is trying to be reasonable and trying to solve the problem, because when something happens in an area that's under dispute, there's got to be
[01:59:34.117 --> 01:59:36.938]  A diplomatic way out, if you're looking for it, and I'm not sure they are.
[01:59:38.238 --> 01:59:43.260]  I'm very much afraid these poor people might be there for some time yet.
[01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:48.501]  Going back to my time in Uzbekistan, of course, that was a terrible regime.
[01:59:48.741 --> 01:59:49.442]  Absolutely awful.
[01:59:49.742 --> 01:59:50.922]  7,000 political prisoners.
[01:59:51.282 --> 01:59:53.103]  Oil's distance to death, literally.
[01:59:54.923 --> 02:00:00.965]  And very much funded back by the US regime, full support of the CIA.
[02:00:02.043 --> 02:00:08.848]  I exposed a lot of that, and I've written it all in my book, which is called Murder in the Summer Camp.
[02:00:09.288 --> 02:00:11.149]  S-A-M-A-R-K-A-N-D.
[02:00:12.110 --> 02:00:14.191]  And it's been selling very well.
[02:00:14.211 --> 02:00:16.633]  It's caused quite a storm.
[02:00:16.913 --> 02:00:25.079]  You want to learn about false flag oppositions and extraordinary rendition and torture from the inside, from an establishment insider who saw it all.
[02:00:25.906 --> 02:00:30.509]  Unfortunately, it's not for sale in the States, but you can get it from Amazon Canada.
[02:00:30.549 --> 02:00:33.151]  It's probably the easiest way for people in the States to get it.
[02:00:33.171 --> 02:00:33.251]  Sure.
[02:00:33.291 --> 02:00:35.472]  We'll get a link to that up on InfoWars.com.
[02:00:35.853 --> 02:00:40.396]  In closing, and I know you've got to leave us, but we've got two minutes left, false flag operations.
[02:00:40.416 --> 02:00:42.337]  My new film, Terror Storm, covers that.
[02:00:42.357 --> 02:00:43.918]  There's so many admissions of that.
[02:00:44.278 --> 02:00:48.361]  What about the false flags that helped bring down Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953?
[02:00:48.401 --> 02:00:51.583]  I mean, the Iranians have a reason to not like the British in the U.S.
[02:00:52.355 --> 02:00:53.736]  There's a lot of history there.
[02:00:53.756 --> 02:00:54.756]  A lot of history there.
[02:00:55.016 --> 02:00:59.618]  I mean, we really messed up that country over many decades.
[02:01:00.238 --> 02:01:02.880]  Entirely, of course, because of the oil, actually.
[02:01:02.900 --> 02:01:04.280]  The old, old story we know so well.
[02:01:05.761 --> 02:01:08.882]  What other... I mean, what are some of the false flags your book covers?
[02:01:09.683 --> 02:01:19.667]  Well, particularly in Uzbekistan, in Tashkent, where in order to justify support for the Tibetan state, the Americans were claiming that
[02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:24.203]  It was a bastion against Al-Qaeda, but there was no Al-Qaeda activity in Uzbekistan.
[02:01:24.223 --> 02:01:26.024]  It was complete nonsense.
[02:01:26.424 --> 02:01:40.953]  So bombs had to be set off in Tashkent, which Colin Powell gave a press conference in Washington where he said, we are going to have to give more support to President Karimov because of these Al-Qaeda bombings in Tashkent, but he knew for certain.
[02:01:41.073 --> 02:01:43.975]  I mean, I know Colin Powell knew he was lying.
[02:01:46.249 --> 02:01:49.333]  We had definite evidence.
[02:01:49.513 --> 02:01:51.336]  Who carried out the bombings?
[02:01:51.456 --> 02:01:54.640]  Uzbekistan Interior Police or our people?
[02:01:55.982 --> 02:01:58.665]  Certainly the Uzbek security services.
[02:02:01.198 --> 02:02:10.023]  Let's just say, I'm both a curfew service, that year received 82 million dollars from the CIA, and they had a CIA operative implanted with them, working very closely.
[02:02:10.623 --> 02:02:19.468]  I can't say for certain the CIA definitely were involved in those bombings, I don't know for sure, but they certainly lied about who did it, that is for sure.
[02:02:19.688 --> 02:02:22.570]  So lied about who did it, and bankrolled the folks that did do it?
[02:02:23.089 --> 02:02:24.350]  Yep, that's definitely true.
[02:02:24.690 --> 02:02:25.410]  Amazing!
[02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:26.891]  I've got to get that book and read it.
[02:02:26.911 --> 02:02:28.571]  I've certainly read a lot of news stories about it.
[02:02:29.392 --> 02:02:30.792]  And tell us your blog, sir.
[02:02:31.472 --> 02:02:34.734]  Yeah, it's CraigMurray.co.uk.
[02:02:35.074 --> 02:02:36.455]  CraigMurray.co.uk.
[02:02:36.575 --> 02:02:38.515]  We'll put a link up on Infowars.com.
[02:02:38.815 --> 02:02:39.916]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[02:02:40.536 --> 02:02:41.857]  Okay, very good to talk to you guys.
[02:02:41.997 --> 02:02:42.317]  Take care.
[02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:47.381]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:02:47.701 --> 02:02:50.482]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:02:50.762 --> 02:02:54.905]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:02:55.345 --> 02:02:56.165]  So what do you do?
[02:02:56.485 --> 02:03:01.048]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:03:01.548 --> 02:03:03.670]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:03:04.150 --> 02:03:18.861]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:03:18.901 --> 02:03:25.966]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:03:26.306 --> 02:03:30.710]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[02:03:32.951 --> 02:03:33.172]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:03:47.509 --> 02:03:52.953]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:53.353 --> 02:04:00.978]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:01.678 --> 02:04:08.741]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.121 --> 02:04:20.546]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:20.866 --> 02:04:24.368]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:24.828 --> 02:04:26.749]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.089 --> 02:04:30.951]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:44.853 --> 02:04:47.194]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:04:47.434 --> 02:04:49.455]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:04:49.615 --> 02:04:56.658]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents or other dangerous toxins.
[02:04:56.938 --> 02:05:05.561]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company for the past 57 years has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:05:05.841 --> 02:05:10.503]  Now for the first time Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[02:05:10.663 --> 02:05:17.331]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients, is earth-friendly, and completely environmentally safe.
[02:05:17.511 --> 02:05:21.876]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:26.600]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:28.281]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.536 --> 02:05:56.998]  We will be taking your calls in this hour on all the breaking news.
[02:05:58.739 --> 02:06:03.482]  We're being told this strike is on for Friday against Iran.
[02:06:03.542 --> 02:06:06.144]  World War III could kick off.
[02:06:06.204 --> 02:06:10.346]  We know it'll jack oil prices to at least double their current prices.
[02:06:11.347 --> 02:06:17.471]  That will cause an even bigger inflationary spike in goods with all the other inflationary pressures we've seen.
[02:06:17.871 --> 02:06:19.392]  Will Iran strike back?
[02:06:19.432 --> 02:06:22.374]  Will they have to then be nuked for daring to fight back?
[02:06:24.116 --> 02:06:29.882]  There's no telling what could happen, but I don't think they'll attack them Friday, or this weekend, or next week.
[02:06:30.863 --> 02:06:37.950]  If they're going to attack, it'll be when that aircraft carrier arrives in the next month, the 3rd Aircraft Carrier Task Force.
[02:06:37.970 --> 02:06:40.653]  They have several other fleets there.
[02:06:40.693 --> 02:06:41.974]  It's an entire armada.
[02:06:43.415 --> 02:06:45.718]  And it's kind of Naval Day, I guess.
[02:06:45.818 --> 02:06:46.919]  We had the former
[02:06:48.346 --> 02:07:07.703]  High Commissioner of this, and High Commissioner of that, and Head of Maritime Section, FCO London, for three years, and the Head of Cyprus Section, FCO, and the Head of the entire Maritime Administration, going over how they would have arrested the Iranians if they came over into their area doing the same thing.
[02:07:08.824 --> 02:07:14.329]  And it was clearly indisputed areas in the edge of Iranian waters, seizing and interdicting Iranian vessels.
[02:07:16.474 --> 02:07:18.095]  And that the British would have arrested them.
[02:07:19.776 --> 02:07:22.858]  But of course, Tony Blair is doing what helps Iran!
[02:07:23.538 --> 02:07:30.382]  Just like when the BBC reported they helped ship parts that could be used for nuclear weapons there and for their reactor program.
[02:07:30.622 --> 02:07:33.143]  Just like Donald Rumsfeld helped arm North Korea.
[02:07:33.464 --> 02:07:35.425]  Just like Rumsfeld helped arm Saddam.
[02:07:36.926 --> 02:07:41.268]  It's the same story over and over and over again.
[02:07:41.288 --> 02:07:44.250]  We're going to go to Eric Schein who worked
[02:07:46.508 --> 02:07:54.212]  As an officer in the Merchant Marine and some of the things he witnessed and then get his take on the whole world and what's happening.
[02:07:54.252 --> 02:07:58.554]  He's a talk show host here on the weekends on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:59.315 --> 02:08:10.821]  Before we go to Mr. Shine and the news and your calls, America Freedom to Fascism is available at Infowars.com via the Safe Secure Online Video and Bookstore Shopping Cart.
[02:08:11.443 --> 02:08:28.433]  And we hope that you will get it, and get it out to everybody you know, because it exposes who really owns this country, and if we can't expose who owns the country, we can't set about removing them, because they illegally hijacked this nation, and have engineered the entire economy to consolidate wealth and destroy the middle class.
[02:08:29.053 --> 02:08:30.494]  It's either they go, or we go.
[02:08:30.514 --> 02:08:31.214]  Do you understand that?
[02:08:32.195 --> 02:08:38.939]  Also, Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C., Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 2.
[02:08:40.265 --> 02:08:43.888]  Getting into all the occult architecture, this will wake anybody up.
[02:08:44.369 --> 02:08:51.155]  You can get it for a serious discount on it when you get it with my new film, The Order of Death, which comes free.
[02:08:51.175 --> 02:09:01.764]  That's right, when you get it with The Order of Death, you get a discount on Riddles in Stone, and then you get free my re-edited, re-release, remastered Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:09:02.104 --> 02:09:04.867]  When I snuck into Bohemian Grove, it's got new information added,
[02:09:05.607 --> 02:09:09.531]  New footage shot inside by an employee of the Grove.
[02:09:11.933 --> 02:09:15.515]  You need to get The Order of Death, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove DVD Combo.
[02:09:15.876 --> 02:09:18.878]  And when you get it, you get Riddles in Stone for a discount.
[02:09:19.178 --> 02:09:23.182]  You can also get Volume 1, America's Secret Beginnings.
[02:09:25.328 --> 02:09:27.388]  With this for a discount as well.
[02:09:27.408 --> 02:09:29.009]  So get Riddles and Stone, that just came out.
[02:09:29.369 --> 02:09:50.153]  Also Aftermath, unanswered questions from 9-11, Iraq for Sale, The War Profiteers, Who's Getting Killed and Who's Making a Killing, Robert Greenwald, Mind Control, A Brave New World, or Enhancing Human Performance by Dr. Nick Begich, 9-11 Press for Truth, The Jersey Girls, of course my new film, Terror Storm, A History of Government Sponsored Terrorists.
[02:09:51.758 --> 02:10:00.668]  And frankly, I think that's the best of the stack I just talked about, but probably the most effective with the generally dumbed-down public is America Freedom to Fascism.
[02:10:00.688 --> 02:10:09.277]  I mean, I can say mine's the best for the history of terror, and then gets into 9-11, and I can say Freedom to Fascism is the best on
[02:10:11.363 --> 02:10:12.483]  The Federal Reserve System.
[02:10:12.583 --> 02:10:13.664]  So here's the toll-free number 888-253-3139.
[02:10:13.684 --> 02:10:14.004]  888-253-3139.
[02:10:14.024 --> 02:10:15.684]  Or you can simply write to me.
[02:10:15.744 --> 02:10:17.865]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:10:35.646 --> 02:10:54.292]  And last but not least, you can see all 15 of my films, dozens of other films we've been authorized to post, hundreds of MyWhitneyTV reports, special reports, vintage TV shows I did 10 years ago, we're uploading a lot of those, just so much new media every day, Chris and Planet.TV, three-year anniversary in a month.
[02:10:56.273 --> 02:10:57.713]  No, wait a minute, it's already April.
[02:10:58.454 --> 02:11:01.915]  We launched it in early April, three years ago, so I guess it's
[02:11:03.266 --> 02:11:06.370]  PrisonPlanet.tv, three years in operation, just gets better and better.
[02:11:06.610 --> 02:11:08.853]  We're upgrading and adding bigger servers as we speak.
[02:11:09.134 --> 02:11:10.796]  Just did it a few months ago, now we're doing it again.
[02:11:11.297 --> 02:11:13.640]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:18.406]  I get a monthly membership for $5.95, the cost of two or three cups of Starbucks coffee.
[02:11:19.279 --> 02:11:21.120]  And then you also fund everything we're doing.
[02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:25.862]  And you get the films in super high quality down to low bandwidth, depending on your connection.
[02:11:26.222 --> 02:11:27.683]  Download them, burn them to disk.
[02:11:27.763 --> 02:11:30.284]  It is a factory of resistance to tyranny.
[02:11:30.764 --> 02:11:33.846]  I mean, when you download Terror Storm, it's in four different quality versions.
[02:11:34.386 --> 02:11:40.669]  When you download it in the highest quality, I mean, it looks almost as good as DVD.
[02:11:40.709 --> 02:11:41.849]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:11:41.930 --> 02:11:43.330]  And what an activist tool.
[02:11:43.770 --> 02:11:44.751]  Burn them to disk.
[02:11:44.851 --> 02:11:45.751]  Burn them to CD.
[02:11:46.211 --> 02:11:47.192]  Get them out to people.
[02:11:47.961 --> 02:11:53.563]  Or you see a particular TV show you think is really informative and is perfect for somebody you know, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:11:53.943 --> 02:11:59.245]  Alright, I'm going to shut up now about that, but it's just such an important part of the fight we're involved in.
[02:12:00.826 --> 02:12:05.468]  And move from the former British Ambassador and the head of the Maritime Administration,
[02:12:07.183 --> 02:12:16.730]  Who before that actually ran the command bunker in London with the intelligence off the ships in the Gulf on what ships to search and where the lines were.
[02:12:16.770 --> 02:12:24.415]  He negotiated the lines, saying clearly they were over the line into the deeply disputed areas which really were in Iranian waters.
[02:12:24.435 --> 02:12:31.300]  Because again, you calculate out so many miles, and it's many miles closer to Iran than it is to Iraq.
[02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:32.241]  It's simple.
[02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:41.312]  If you go 50-50 and draw a line, not the map Blair's got, but if you draw a line between the two, where the ship really was, it's clear.
[02:12:42.313 --> 02:12:54.456]  But Eric Schein received a congressional and presidential appointment and commission to serve as an officer in the valid federal service of the United States Merchant Marine.
[02:12:55.433 --> 02:13:04.344]  This honor was confirmed on Shina 91 by none other than Vice President Dan Quayle of the United States, Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York on Long Island 91.
[02:13:05.064 --> 02:13:14.215]  And then it goes on to say that's the sister academy of the Federal Academies of West Point, Annapolis, and the Air Force and Coast Guard.
[02:13:16.943 --> 02:13:17.664]  Thanks a lot Alex.
[02:13:42.689 --> 02:13:55.822]  Tell the listeners about, number one, when your radio show is, you're on the network, and then expand out from there, and just in a nutshell, what happened to you, what you saw on the Merchant Marine, and then tie that into everything that's happening right now.
[02:13:57.703 --> 02:14:05.551]  Well, the site is, well, you can go to GCN Live, and the show is on 3 to 5 on Saturdays, and that's Central Time.
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:14.262]  And it gets into a lot of the issues of war profiteering and privateering, which is the core of everything that's going on.
[02:14:14.282 --> 02:14:20.964]  And the only way we can stop the war is to address who's involved in carrying out the war profiteering and how they're doing it.
[02:14:21.264 --> 02:14:26.466]  Even people like Colin Powell has gone before and actually advocated for things called block funding.
[02:14:26.906 --> 02:14:31.087]  And when you look into that deeper, I won't go into it now, it's an instrument that they use
[02:14:31.647 --> 02:14:58.489]  To basically say like, say you have a, well I'll briefly mention it is, say you build an Aegis class destroyer, missile frigate, that can lock on, you know, 300 targets simultaneously, it's a billion dollar vessel, rather than having line item accounting, accounting people and budget people who are civil servants, public servants, oversight and more, they want to set up the system, okay well we know roughly it's going to be a billion dollars, give us a billion dollars and we'll give you a ship.
[02:14:59.204 --> 02:15:14.506]  And that's what Colin Powell actually gone before Congress and advocated for, which was no oversight turning the United States and our entire, you know, accounting processes and budgeting processes into one giant general slush fund.
[02:15:15.919 --> 02:15:27.033]  Already, Eric, as you know, most of the parts for our ships, our airplanes, for the components, the missiles are built in China, built in Europe, built in Latin America, built in South Korea.
[02:15:27.634 --> 02:15:33.762]  And then, of course, when Dubai wanted to buy the 26 ports, every major port there is, folks,
[02:15:34.462 --> 02:15:35.643]  And you're going to talk about the St.
[02:15:35.663 --> 02:15:39.185]  Lawrence Seaway and some new developments today with us, with your expertise.
[02:15:39.545 --> 02:15:41.866]  Then Halliburton stepped in and said, well, we'll manage it.
[02:15:42.226 --> 02:15:44.387]  Well, now they're moving to Dubai.
[02:15:44.988 --> 02:15:48.309]  And I remember all these good old boys going, let them have no-bid contracts.
[02:15:48.590 --> 02:15:50.230]  We don't want the Frenchies to get it.
[02:15:50.551 --> 02:15:52.031]  The foreigners could never get it.
[02:15:52.071 --> 02:15:54.392]  These were no-bid for American companies.
[02:15:54.653 --> 02:15:57.774]  But Sean Hannity and others lied and said, we don't want to give the French a contract.
[02:15:57.794 --> 02:15:59.055]  It was a total smoke and mirror.
[02:15:59.615 --> 02:16:02.218]  Now, they admit almost $4 trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[02:16:02.478 --> 02:16:04.079]  Rumsfeld says, I don't have to answer your question.
[02:16:04.099 --> 02:16:04.940]  I'm not going to tell you where it is.
[02:16:04.980 --> 02:16:06.982]  So, talk about no accountability.
[02:16:07.002 --> 02:16:09.704]  I mean, this is the la-la land of looting.
[02:16:10.765 --> 02:16:15.209]  Well, and it gets worse because now AIG supposedly runs and controls the ports.
[02:16:15.269 --> 02:16:18.131]  They did the whole Dubai deal and tried to push that.
[02:16:18.552 --> 02:16:22.295]  And then now even Lou Dobbs has come out and said, well, it's a done deal.
[02:16:22.355 --> 02:16:22.875]  It's settled.
[02:16:22.935 --> 02:16:25.898]  Now we have an American company running our ports or in charge of our ports.
[02:16:26.338 --> 02:16:49.780]  And if you look into what AIG is, it's an insurance company, and what happened at the World Trade Center, no matter what you want to spin as far as, you know, I'm not saying you, but them, whoever, whatever story you want to follow or whatever conspiracy theory you want to follow, whether it's theirs or the ones that they're accusing everyone else of, the World Trade Center was an enormous public trust.
[02:16:50.616 --> 02:16:54.618]  And they've seized upon that, just like they're trying to seize upon everything.
[02:16:54.638 --> 02:16:57.859]  Well, they handed it over to Silverstein two months before and then blew it all up.
[02:16:58.820 --> 02:16:59.620]  Well, yeah.
[02:16:59.660 --> 02:17:04.922]  I mean, if you want to go that far, I'm probably right there with you.
[02:17:04.942 --> 02:17:08.184]  Well, I went that far two months before 9-11, so I can't go back now, Eric.
[02:17:08.996 --> 02:17:10.837]  You're right, and I've seen what you've been out there.
[02:17:10.857 --> 02:17:12.838]  And there's other things that people need to look at, though.
[02:17:12.858 --> 02:17:16.340]  When you look at the World Trade Center itself, it's controlled by Port Authority.
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:18.662]  Department of Transportation got involved.
[02:17:18.942 --> 02:17:20.243]  Andrew Card is involved.
[02:17:20.263 --> 02:17:21.844]  He went to my dad at Kings Point.
[02:17:22.304 --> 02:17:25.126]  He was former Secretary of Transportation under the first Bush.
[02:17:26.847 --> 02:17:33.515]  Basically, the government is now nothing but a giant vacuum cleaner to suck all of our assets and infrastructure offshore.
[02:17:33.955 --> 02:17:39.962]  Then they're going to fold the country up into a third world police state and use us as military cannon fodder to dominate the rest of the globe.
[02:17:40.282 --> 02:17:41.243]  Total enslavement.
[02:17:46.716 --> 02:17:51.198]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:51.558 --> 02:17:55.639]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:55.939 --> 02:17:56.479]  We listened.
[02:17:56.799 --> 02:18:01.781]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:02.041 --> 02:18:02.541]  We listened.
[02:18:02.921 --> 02:18:05.942]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:06.382 --> 02:18:06.923]  We listened.
[02:18:07.383 --> 02:18:11.084]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power hours.
[02:18:11.084 --> 02:18:11.384]  We're good.
[02:18:27.805 --> 02:18:30.446]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[02:18:30.646 --> 02:18:30.846]  Only $279.
[02:18:30.907 --> 02:18:31.487]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:31.527 --> 02:18:31.767]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:18:33.468 --> 02:18:34.428]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:45.370 --> 02:18:47.252]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:18:47.312 --> 02:18:48.293]  It's April 2nd, 2007, and gold is at $6.59.
[02:18:48.373 --> 02:18:51.576]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $7.8238, $3.4374 for half, and $1.7187 for quarter ounce coins at $6.8238, $3.4374, and $1.7187.
[02:19:03.388 --> 02:19:06.972]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[02:19:07.052 --> 02:19:10.035]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[02:19:10.135 --> 02:19:19.225]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[02:19:19.545 --> 02:19:24.831]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[02:19:25.291 --> 02:19:27.592]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[02:19:27.632 --> 02:19:30.073]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[02:19:30.474 --> 02:19:33.715]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.795 --> 02:19:37.477]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.

[02:19:39.478 --> 02:19:43.060]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:46.221]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:19:46.341 --> 02:19:47.662]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:19:47.822 --> 02:19:50.643]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:19:51.004 --> 02:19:53.725]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:19:54.301 --> 02:20:01.029]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:20:44.111 --> 02:20:50.613]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:20:50.853 --> 02:20:54.834]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:20:55.115 --> 02:20:57.275]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:20:57.635 --> 02:20:59.616]  All Natural Non-X clears out the sores
[02:20:59.616 --> 02:20:59.916]  I think so.
[02:21:25.545 --> 02:21:26.146]  We're good to go.
[02:21:50.453 --> 02:21:52.694]  He does a talk show Saturdays 3 to 5 p.m.
[02:21:52.714 --> 02:21:54.235]  right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:54.275 --> 02:21:54.995]  He's Eric Schein.
[02:21:55.015 --> 02:22:00.578]  I thought we'd get him on because of this whole situation with the captured Brits.
[02:22:01.838 --> 02:22:03.099]  We've got the war drums beating.
[02:22:03.399 --> 02:22:11.683]  Eric, give us your take on when we just had the former head of the British Maritime Administration on, and also the former British Ambassador,
[02:22:12.313 --> 02:22:20.887]  Getting into how clearly they would have arrested Iranians if they were that far into their waters and then Blair just wants a war provocation or a propaganda provocation.
[02:22:21.829 --> 02:22:25.455]  With your time in the Merchant Marine and your time witnessing all this, give us your take on it.
[02:22:26.215 --> 02:22:27.456]  Well, I'm also a naval officer.
[02:22:27.476 --> 02:22:34.639]  I come out of King's Point with a commission as a United States naval officer with top-secret security clearance, all sorts of training and stuff.
[02:22:34.919 --> 02:22:42.543]  And we have to read and understand and study people like Alfred Thayer-Mahan, who got into projection of power and sea power.
[02:22:43.283 --> 02:22:47.385]  And what's going on is they're trying to create a dispute under maritime situs
[02:22:48.381 --> 02:22:55.426]  Basically, just like they're doing all along the border with small insurgencies or incursions into and across the border.
[02:22:56.146 --> 02:23:00.629]  They're even flying drones in and along and across the border.
[02:23:01.209 --> 02:23:06.993]  They're trying to create disputes, much like the Germans did in Poland before they invaded Poland.
[02:23:07.473 --> 02:23:14.838]  They're doing everything and anything to have some quote-unquote legal excuse to carry on and launch a war, and I believe it's very close.
[02:23:17.059 --> 02:23:28.624]  And I hate to bring this up, and I get hit up for it so much, but in my own, because it goes like, when they brought charges against me in March 6th of 2003, 12 days later they launched the war in Iraq.
[02:23:29.064 --> 02:23:36.287]  Now they're really heating up things with me again, and they brought in an administrative law judge who's ruled on commerce cases against Iran.
[02:23:37.085 --> 02:23:44.030]  He's actually ruled on cases that affect the supply and demand of oil on the market, which goes towards, you know, oil profiteering.
[02:23:45.030 --> 02:23:48.733]  Well, since you brought up your case, in a nutshell, tell folks what happened to you.
[02:23:50.107 --> 02:23:59.237]  Well, because I actually sued and went against a bunch of these federal contractors, a very special type of shipping companies, and even my own Federal Officer's Association, that's a federal contractor itself.
[02:24:00.638 --> 02:24:11.810]  They held and detained me in court for years, had me in a bunch of different courts all at the same time, and then after they had beaten me up, taken my homes and everything else, they got Homeland Security to file a counter-complaint.
[02:24:12.330 --> 02:24:16.331]  Pull me out of civil court, and then even prosecute me for my civil complaint.
[02:24:16.732 --> 02:24:23.594]  And I have the statutory right, even constitutional right, to not only get into state court, federal district court, but we have a written subject matter.
[02:24:23.654 --> 02:24:34.538]  And this was basically like a police officer's association with the Merchant Marines slash Navy group, and then you were suing because they were, what, privatizing everything?
[02:24:35.396 --> 02:24:41.223]  Well, and they weren't, they're taking, this kind of goes into what Bill Frist was up to, they're taking things that are paid for by the U.S.
[02:24:41.263 --> 02:24:52.658]  taxpayer that they're supposed to provide on federal contracts as line items, not providing them, and then charging the individuals, the beneficiaries of any kind of a federal trust or contract the cost
[02:24:53.098 --> 02:24:57.780]  Of actually providing those benefits or an access fee to get those benefits that they're supposed to provide.
[02:24:58.100 --> 02:25:01.221]  And then what they're doing is they're taking the money and sticking it in their own pocket.
[02:25:01.241 --> 02:25:03.823]  Okay, now let's get back into World War III heating up here.
[02:25:04.203 --> 02:25:08.965]  A lot of people are saying that they think that the attack's going to start on March 6th.
[02:25:09.165 --> 02:25:10.205]  I don't think that's the case.
[02:25:10.665 --> 02:25:17.168]  They like to continually announce the attack, get everybody to basically expect it to come, as if it's a foregone conclusion, and then launch it.
[02:25:17.628 --> 02:25:20.510]  I think you're going to see it in the next six months or so.
[02:25:20.730 --> 02:25:21.470]  Give me your take on that.
[02:25:22.199 --> 02:25:23.080]  I think it's much sooner.
[02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:25.261]  That's what I was trying to say.
[02:25:25.281 --> 02:25:33.386]  They brought in this ALJ and it's basically to stifle me and the timing with what they launched in Iraq and what's happened here and the parallels throughout.
[02:25:34.493 --> 02:25:42.895]  You know, not only is it disturbing to blow my mind, but it raises a red flag that these guys are set to go in very soon, and I mean within a couple weeks.
[02:25:43.395 --> 02:25:45.575]  It may be a couple months, but I don't think so.
[02:25:45.615 --> 02:25:47.836]  I think they're set to go in here within the next couple weeks.
[02:25:47.936 --> 02:25:48.156]  What?
[02:25:48.216 --> 02:25:58.018]  I mean that they're going to start prosecuting dissenters across the country, in and out of the military, or federal service, to kind of squash any resistance?
[02:26:00.038 --> 02:26:01.398]  Well, you know how they use this.
[02:26:01.458 --> 02:26:05.879]  They have a foreign war so that they can carry on class warfare here at home.
[02:26:07.299 --> 02:26:08.580]  I mean, literally, that's what's going on.
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:13.841]  They're going after any dissidents, any political dissidents, or complainants as well.
[02:26:13.861 --> 02:26:14.061]  Well, yeah.
[02:26:14.121 --> 02:26:17.562]  I mean, O'Reilly says we're in a war, arrested anybody that disagrees with the government.
[02:26:17.622 --> 02:26:19.102]  Michael Weiner Savage says that.
[02:26:20.142 --> 02:26:24.863]  They're saying murder Rosie O'Donnell on MSNBC, openly calling for murder.
[02:26:25.566 --> 02:26:39.999]  That's overt fascism and corporatism to the point where it's as bad if not worse, especially when you consider the resources and power and influence that we have, technologically, militarily, you know, some say we're in financial straits.
[02:26:41.881 --> 02:26:49.368]  Even if you look deeper than that, we're in a predicament now where if this is not stopped, we will be deep within World War, and not just in Iran.
[02:26:51.394 --> 02:26:52.255]  But that's the plan.
[02:26:52.295 --> 02:26:55.559]  They love to get us sucked into something that just goes on and on and on.
[02:26:55.599 --> 02:26:56.620]  People say, well, is it for oil?
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:57.281]  Is it for weapons?
[02:26:57.341 --> 02:26:58.542]  Is it for domestic police state?
[02:26:58.903 --> 02:27:00.044]  Is it for no-bid contracts?
[02:27:00.124 --> 02:27:00.905]  It's for it all.
[02:27:01.266 --> 02:27:04.089]  The new order does what's good for them across the board.
[02:27:05.029 --> 02:27:05.530]  Yep, yep.
[02:27:05.610 --> 02:27:06.490]  And they've done this before.
[02:27:06.831 --> 02:27:10.133]  Warburg, Harriman Brothers, Prescott Bush, Samuel Bush.
[02:27:10.574 --> 02:27:14.337]  Carlisle is the replacement for Brown Brothers Harriman and Warburg.
[02:27:14.697 --> 02:27:25.866]  It's been going throughout the military-industrial industry and buying up military-industrial complex assets and adding value to them and spinning them off by wars and rumors of war.
[02:27:26.226 --> 02:27:26.646]  Stay there.
[02:27:26.666 --> 02:27:30.229]  We're going to come back and talk about what the Carlisle Group is from your perspective.
[02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:31.070]  I'll give mine.
[02:27:31.090 --> 02:27:31.991]  We'll also take calls.
[02:27:32.771 --> 02:27:33.132]  Stay with us.
[02:27:34.961 --> 02:27:37.951]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.874 --> 02:27:41.562]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.980 --> 02:27:51.123]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:27:51.343 --> 02:27:53.104]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:27:53.364 --> 02:27:59.648]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:27:59.949 --> 02:28:06.073]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:28:06.313 --> 02:28:12.357]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:12.637 --> 02:28:19.041]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:28:19.181 --> 02:28:22.723]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[02:28:23.023 --> 02:28:26.726]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[02:28:26.926 --> 02:28:29.467]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:28:29.587 --> 02:28:30.648]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:30.868 --> 02:28:31.469]  We're good to go.
[02:28:55.183 --> 02:28:58.344]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[02:28:58.564 --> 02:29:02.266]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[02:29:02.526 --> 02:29:10.469]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.

[02:29:45.484 --> 02:29:49.246]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[02:29:49.626 --> 02:29:56.949]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[02:29:57.389 --> 02:30:08.354]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:30:08.414 --> 02:30:08.874]  Central.
[02:30:09.234 --> 02:30:14.817]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[02:30:15.157 --> 02:30:21.062]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:30:21.562 --> 02:30:26.306]  We invite you to hear our program, One We Pray Will Strengthen and Bless You.
[02:30:26.687 --> 02:30:31.490]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.

[02:30:33.292 --> 02:30:33.712]  Central.

[02:30:48.194 --> 02:31:13.901]  Day after day Alone on a hill The man with the foolish grin Is keeping perfectly still But nobody wants to know him They can see that he's just a fool And he never gives an answer But the fool under him
[02:31:14.551 --> 02:31:16.112]  Welcome back.
[02:31:16.332 --> 02:31:22.656]  Eric Schein, who's really a smart fellow.
[02:31:23.217 --> 02:31:27.980]  I've listened to him for a while.
[02:31:35.197 --> 02:31:36.897]  Has a show here 3 to 5 p.m.
[02:31:36.937 --> 02:31:39.538]  Saturdays on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:39.558 --> 02:31:43.319]  We have links over there to the site at Infowars.com and PrismHunter.com.
[02:31:43.339 --> 02:31:47.220]  I want to talk to Richard, Chris, Mark, Jimmy, Dave, Chris, and many others.
[02:31:47.240 --> 02:31:51.661]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:52.701 --> 02:32:02.143]  Boiling it down, give us your view on, as I always say, bottom line, thumbnail, sketch, nutshell, Eric Schein.
[02:32:03.576 --> 02:32:07.666]  On the info and your view on what's happened with these captured British sailors.
[02:32:08.999 --> 02:32:17.666]  Well, we talked about it, and I believe the ambassador talked about it or touched on it, is they're using it as a reason to incite war.
[02:32:18.226 --> 02:32:20.468]  I mean, it's being trumped up.
[02:32:20.588 --> 02:32:29.434]  Normally, in a situation like this, you do what's diplomatically necessary to get your sailors back, and they're not putting the sailors, you know, at the forefront of their mind.
[02:32:29.454 --> 02:32:32.436]  They're putting war and war with Iran at the forefront of their mind.
[02:32:32.897 --> 02:32:38.281]  And they're denying it, they're saying that they're not, but they're taking all, you know, another carrier group has headed over there.
[02:32:38.941 --> 02:32:48.127]  And the government continues to say we may attack Iran any minute, but then if you say, no, we don't want war, they go, oh, you're a conspiracy terrorist.
[02:32:48.147 --> 02:32:49.048]  We're not planning war.
[02:32:49.328 --> 02:32:50.589]  Just like they did with Iraq.
[02:32:50.649 --> 02:32:53.671]  I mean, they talk to us like we're five years old or something.
[02:32:54.551 --> 02:32:57.772]  But even Afghanistan, I mean, you really have to look at the true history there.
[02:32:58.192 --> 02:33:00.833]  That was not even a legal or justified war, either.
[02:33:00.913 --> 02:33:03.013]  And they can say about Tora Bora and bin Laden.
[02:33:03.693 --> 02:33:05.374]  Bin Laden was a CIA construct.
[02:33:05.894 --> 02:33:11.575]  You know, we put him in place, we put him in power, just like the Europeans did with Attila the Hun and his brothers.
[02:33:11.635 --> 02:33:14.356]  They basically gave him a king ransom to stay out of Europe.
[02:33:14.856 --> 02:33:17.058]  And then he funded an army with it and started to invade Europe.
[02:33:17.498 --> 02:33:20.981]  So it's like, you know, there's a term blowback, you've probably heard that.
[02:33:21.802 --> 02:33:39.797]  It's becoming to the point where we're creating all these problems, and it's not that it's by defect or default, it's by intent, and that powers that be within our government and the corporations are doing it for enormous profiteering, war profiteering and privateering, to the point of dissolution of our country.
[02:33:40.357 --> 02:33:41.017]  We're good to go.
[02:34:02.785 --> 02:34:05.567]  Well, I couldn't say it better myself, Eric.
[02:34:05.767 --> 02:34:06.468]  There's all this evidence.
[02:34:26.287 --> 02:34:41.535]  Volumes and volumes, a library of evidence to 9-11 being an inside job, but some of the strongest evidence is why I went public two months before the attack and said they're going to attack the World Trade Center, they'll probably blame it on their asset, as some have been lied to, was the preparatory.
[02:34:41.575 --> 02:34:49.299]  They were showing him on TV, they were saying the Taliban's going to get you, and then of course we learned Bush had to launch orders on his desk to attack two days before 9-11.
[02:34:50.678 --> 02:34:52.338]  Yeah, but it goes much deeper than that.
[02:34:52.358 --> 02:35:04.121]  The attack in 93 was carried out so that they could get plans and access to the information for the building and also carry out a test explosion to see what was required to eventually take it down.
[02:35:04.501 --> 02:35:05.901]  All this stuff is tied together.
[02:35:06.141 --> 02:35:18.884]  Well, the FBI cooked the bomb and trained the drivers, so it was all an FBI operation back in 1993, but it was a point in building America... Well, go ahead.
[02:35:19.631 --> 02:35:22.453]  Well, I was going to say the World Trade Center, what it is, it was a public trust.
[02:35:23.934 --> 02:35:26.876]  It was under the auspices of the Department of Transportation.
[02:35:27.576 --> 02:35:28.897]  Port Authority was involved.
[02:35:28.957 --> 02:35:30.599]  New York and New Jersey were involved.
[02:35:30.879 --> 02:35:35.842]  But more importantly, it had the inherent powers as a public trust of eminent domain.
[02:35:36.162 --> 02:35:48.691]  And shortly thereafter, you get this decision to basically move to privatize, through enforcement of the government, the powers of eminent domain, and not to put in a railroad or a highway as a public trust.
[02:35:49.491 --> 02:35:55.475]  But you actually just come in and if you could increase the tax base somehow, for some reason, you could go ahead and seize someone's property.
[02:35:55.615 --> 02:36:02.520]  Yeah, this is just the old days of the empires coming in and dominating the population.
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:03.821]  Let's take some calls.
[02:36:03.861 --> 02:36:06.042]  Let's talk to Richard.
[02:36:06.242 --> 02:36:07.843]  Richard, where are you calling us from today?
[02:36:08.724 --> 02:36:09.525]  Pretty good, Alex.
[02:36:09.885 --> 02:36:10.245]  Remember?
[02:36:10.945 --> 02:36:12.246]  Where are you calling us from, Richard?
[02:36:12.266 --> 02:36:14.508]  From Meridian, Mississippi.
[02:36:14.728 --> 02:36:15.488]  Welcome, go ahead.
[02:36:15.949 --> 02:36:17.650]  Well, remember American dictators?
[02:36:19.335 --> 02:36:20.979]  Yes, it's a documentary I made, yes.
[02:36:21.419 --> 02:36:21.640]  Yeah.
[02:36:22.361 --> 02:36:27.692]  Well, with elections coming up 2008 and next year, I believe it may be, no doubt, be important.
[02:36:29.975 --> 02:36:31.436]  What, the film American Dictators?
[02:36:31.796 --> 02:36:32.037]  Yeah.
[02:36:32.577 --> 02:36:33.398]  Well, absolutely.
[02:36:33.438 --> 02:36:39.642]  Look, you're going to have some hand-picked Republican, like Giuliani or Mitt Romney, totally in the world order.
[02:36:40.063 --> 02:36:41.324]  Or you're going to have Hillary.
[02:36:42.224 --> 02:36:44.686]  I mean, and again, they're going to try to make you choose.
[02:36:44.926 --> 02:36:47.328]  But again, it all serves... And you have no choice.
[02:36:47.828 --> 02:36:48.669]  And you have no choice.
[02:36:48.709 --> 02:36:55.894]  And it all serves as the illusion of choice and a distraction from the real fight happening at the county, city, and state level.
[02:36:56.775 --> 02:36:59.297]  I believe that it's time we have to
[02:37:06.616 --> 02:37:07.937]  Well, that's what we're trying to do, sir.
[02:37:08.157 --> 02:37:09.738]  And I really do appreciate your call, Richard.
[02:37:09.758 --> 02:37:10.459]  Good to hear from you.
[02:37:10.479 --> 02:37:11.240]  Chris in Florida.
[02:37:11.260 --> 02:37:11.820]  You're on the air.
[02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:12.261]  Go ahead.
[02:37:12.281 --> 02:37:13.922]  How are you doing today?
[02:37:14.603 --> 02:37:16.904]  Hi, this is Chris Steiner in Dunedin, Florida.
[02:37:17.525 --> 02:37:17.925]  Good, sir.
[02:37:17.965 --> 02:37:18.286]  Welcome.
[02:37:18.306 --> 02:37:18.626]  Go ahead.
[02:37:18.646 --> 02:37:28.054]  I wanted to give out a little bit of information on some of what I would call cure-alls, miracle cures, help to keep people healthy, healthy and recover.
[02:37:29.445 --> 02:37:30.545]  One of them is colostrum.
[02:37:31.486 --> 02:37:32.907]  Colostrum is great to take.
[02:37:33.327 --> 02:37:37.310]  It's also great if you have any cuts that might happen to be infected.
[02:37:38.411 --> 02:37:39.531]  It's great to put in the cut.
[02:37:40.152 --> 02:37:42.554]  It's full of immune factors, growth factors.
[02:37:43.354 --> 02:37:46.496]  It's great for diabetes, great for modulating the immune system.
[02:37:46.536 --> 02:37:49.939]  So if you have an overactive autoimmune disease, it'll help with that.
[02:37:49.959 --> 02:37:54.121]  There are many studies behind it being antiviral and antibacterial.
[02:37:55.302 --> 02:37:57.864]  Another cure or another treatment
[02:37:58.445 --> 02:37:59.486]  It's good to see you.
[02:38:29.208 --> 02:38:29.830]  Just a couple.
[02:38:30.331 --> 02:38:38.848]  For those who can't afford to go outside the country to get ozone therapy, there are a couple of great products that are magnesium peroxide.
[02:38:39.338 --> 02:38:43.340]  Which is not harmful as is hydrogen peroxide.
[02:38:44.021 --> 02:38:46.742]  One product is called Homozon, H-O-M-O-Z-O-N.
[02:38:46.862 --> 02:38:48.063]  It's been around since 1898.
[02:38:48.303 --> 02:38:50.044]  You can look it up on the internet.
[02:38:50.244 --> 02:38:54.506]  And another great product is OxiCleanze by EarthBounty.
[02:38:54.666 --> 02:38:55.467]  I don't support any.
[02:38:55.507 --> 02:38:56.808]  They're two different companies.
[02:38:56.888 --> 02:38:58.168]  I'm not affiliated with them.
[02:38:58.328 --> 02:39:05.873]  Right, so this is just kind of not... I mean, it's okay because I don't censor calls, but it really is outside of the...
[02:39:07.392 --> 02:39:12.735]  You know, kind of the rules of talk radio, just, you know, basic etiquette, because it keeps going on and on.
[02:39:12.755 --> 02:39:17.197]  Do you have any questions or comments for our guests or on any of the 15 topics we put out?
[02:39:18.378 --> 02:39:30.744]  Oh, I called Bill O'Reilly last week and he threatened to call her a couple of calls before me when I called him about how Rosie O'Donnell and that detective Bo Diedle threatened Charlie Sheen, and I asked him, I asked
[02:39:33.217 --> 02:39:39.379]  I asked Bill O'Reilly what he thought about Moe Dietl saying Martin Sheetz kid better watch it.
[02:39:39.460 --> 02:39:41.981]  I asked him what does that mean and Bill said I don't know.
[02:39:42.401 --> 02:39:46.442]  But the caller just a couple of calls before me... Well that's interesting what you just said.
[02:39:46.482 --> 02:39:50.044]  I'm glad that... I mean now you're a great caller because you're bringing up points here.
[02:39:50.384 --> 02:39:52.965]  What do you think of him now calling for the arrest of Rosie?
[02:39:54.566 --> 02:39:56.668]  Now on MSNBC, they're calling for her murder.
[02:39:56.688 --> 02:39:58.689]  They're openly saying she needs to be murdered.
[02:39:58.789 --> 02:40:01.451]  If she is murdered, MSNBC is going to be liable.
[02:40:01.791 --> 02:40:09.137]  What do you think of O'Reilly, now we learn, threatening Rosie to stay quiet about his pervert behavior, or he would, quote, go after her?
[02:40:10.253 --> 02:40:17.819]  Well, they're accessories and accomplices to murder after the fact, as you've mentioned, and it's not surprising that they would shamelessly call for murder.
[02:40:18.040 --> 02:40:22.403]  And Rosie, you know, saying that Rosie needs to apologize to the members of the family.
[02:40:23.044 --> 02:40:31.951]  Of course, you've talked about the coalition of 911families.org, you know, over 5,000 members, over 2,000 families.
[02:40:31.971 --> 02:40:34.694]  I've been calling into talk shows to let people know about that.
[02:40:35.274 --> 02:40:49.866]  Yeah, that's a great point because you've got the head of the group, Bill Doyle, who's lost his son Joey, saying the majority of the biggest group believes it's an inside job and he does, and then they get up there and they say, the families hate you, you're destroying their memory.
[02:40:49.946 --> 02:40:53.329]  No, we're exposing for those that did lose their family members
[02:40:53.869 --> 02:40:59.533]  Uh, who really murdered him, and we're not going to let the murderers use their murder, uh, to take our freedoms away.
[02:40:59.774 --> 02:41:04.557]  But again, they say, oh, you're against the troops, because we want to save the troops, and get them out of harm's way for no reason.
[02:41:05.217 --> 02:41:08.440]  Uh, why don't you comment on that, Eric Schein?
[02:41:09.944 --> 02:41:12.547]  Um, well, can I throw in a couple topics real quick?
[02:41:12.667 --> 02:41:16.831]  A couple things I was biting at the bit to try to throw in, and I believe it's important.
[02:41:16.851 --> 02:41:17.992]  Sure, I'm going to let that caller go.
[02:41:18.032 --> 02:41:18.692]  Thank you, caller.
[02:41:19.013 --> 02:41:19.854]  Go ahead.
[02:41:20.214 --> 02:41:21.375]  There's a tax upon the St.
[02:41:21.395 --> 02:41:27.921]  Lawrence Seaway right now to try to privatize that and even pass it to the Chinese, much like what has happened with the Panama Canal.
[02:41:28.061 --> 02:41:30.283]  Well, why not give away all of our key waterways?
[02:41:30.403 --> 02:41:31.845]  I mean, you know, we're here to be sold out.
[02:41:32.702 --> 02:41:40.468]  Well, we're not, but that's what's going on, and they're economically redeveloping us, recolonizing the United States.
[02:41:40.528 --> 02:41:41.949]  And let me explain something here.
[02:41:42.070 --> 02:41:47.454]  Mexico had a low-value currency, but they wouldn't let you come buy up their infrastructure.
[02:41:47.854 --> 02:41:48.574]  The U.S.
[02:41:48.594 --> 02:41:54.835]  now has a devalued dollar, and the Spanish, and the Arabs, and the Chinese, and the British, and the French, and the Dutch.
[02:41:55.155 --> 02:41:57.896]  It's a fire sale, but they're not even paying regular price.
[02:41:58.196 --> 02:42:05.997]  They're so criminal, they come in and literally pay a few million here and there to lobbyists, who then buy the politicians, and then they just give them all the roads.
[02:42:06.237 --> 02:42:07.678]  Take the toll roads here in Texas!
[02:42:08.678 --> 02:42:11.078]  Well, and it's royal families that are coming in and doing this.
[02:42:11.298 --> 02:42:14.399]  Old royal families from Europe and other countries.
[02:42:14.890 --> 02:42:16.451]  But isn't that what America's about?
[02:42:16.951 --> 02:42:25.997]  Cops in black masks pulling you over, searching your car, machine guns, cameras, helicopters, and royalty being given the roads and taxing us with tracker chips.
[02:42:26.037 --> 02:42:29.619]  I mean, royalty taxing us with tracker chips is freedom, Eric Schon.
[02:42:30.419 --> 02:42:31.020]  Yeah, right.
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:31.920]  I don't believe so.
[02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:35.743]  But real quick, too, is that... Well, that's because you're with Al-Qaeda?
[02:42:36.103 --> 02:42:37.244]  What, you want to hurt the troops?
[02:42:37.284 --> 02:42:38.104]  You hate America?
[02:42:38.124 --> 02:42:39.365]  Yeah, right.
[02:42:40.298 --> 02:42:45.847]  I mean, see, you could come out and say you're against cancer, and Bill O'Reilly would say, how dare you be against America!
[02:42:46.127 --> 02:42:47.269]  I mean, that's all they say!
[02:42:47.289 --> 02:42:54.541]  Yeah, they're just... I can come up with so many names... And they're the ones killing America!
[02:42:55.359 --> 02:43:04.907]  But real quick, one of the things that Martin Borman did, who was executive director under Hitler before Germany fell, was he outsourced over 750 corporations worldwide.
[02:43:05.528 --> 02:43:14.235]  And those were little fingerlings, little feudal systems, corporate systems, which, you know, corporations are a construct of feudalism.
[02:43:14.295 --> 02:43:19.159]  Yeah, one of the head people over that entire banking system was, of course, Prescott Bush here.
[02:43:19.219 --> 02:43:22.302]  He was one of the honey cows delivering the goodies.
[02:43:23.283 --> 02:43:25.665]  Right, and now they're calling in all their cards.
[02:43:26.086 --> 02:43:29.048]  And this is a continuation of what went on before.
[02:43:29.409 --> 02:43:34.313]  But real quick is also 97% of our cargo is now carried by foreign flag.
[02:43:34.794 --> 02:43:38.938]  1% or less of that entire total cargo is actually inspected.
[02:43:39.879 --> 02:43:49.769]  Uh, you can go into other... But don't worry, they're going to put cameras in your child's school bathroom, they're going to search you and command you and order you around, because it's for America!
[02:43:50.009 --> 02:43:54.614]  And the CPS is going to grab all these kids, and then they all come up missing, but that's okay.
[02:43:54.974 --> 02:43:59.459]  Don't worry, like you said, less than 1% is being searched of the cargo containers.
[02:44:00.091 --> 02:44:07.313]  Well, and also you can go to www.usmma.edu.
[02:44:07.753 --> 02:44:11.594]  And you can see their true history on what's going on, or has gone on, with the Merchant Marine.
[02:44:11.634 --> 02:44:14.415]  It is a valid Federal and Military Service Academy.
[02:44:15.035 --> 02:44:16.976]  They're trying to privatize that also.
[02:44:17.936 --> 02:44:22.618]  If you look at who the Dean is and where he came from, he's from Bombay.
[02:44:23.138 --> 02:44:25.138]  He actually went to a foreign Maritime Academy.
[02:44:25.178 --> 02:44:27.459]  It's not a King's Pointers Dean of the Academy.
[02:44:28.099 --> 02:44:29.480]  Or anyone from this country.
[02:44:29.500 --> 02:44:35.522]  And also look into, you know, Mail Call with the gunny that's on the History Channel.
[02:44:35.562 --> 02:44:38.223]  They've come out and done a hit piece now on the Merchant Marine and what it is.
[02:44:38.604 --> 02:44:40.644]  And that it's all quote-unquote civilian service.
[02:44:41.065 --> 02:44:41.925]  And that's not true.
[02:44:42.825 --> 02:44:45.346]  And, you know, part of this is because some of this was created under FDR.
[02:44:45.366 --> 02:44:47.367]  The Merchant Marine Act.
[02:44:47.447 --> 02:44:48.868]  It wasn't really FDR that did it.
[02:44:48.908 --> 02:44:51.349]  It was Congress at the time, which were driven by the people.
[02:44:52.129 --> 02:44:56.271]  They passed the Merchant Marine Act in 1936 that instituted my academy at King's Point.
[02:44:57.212 --> 02:44:58.252]  I mean, let's boil this down.
[02:44:58.432 --> 02:45:00.073]  Everything is being exsanguinated.
[02:45:00.394 --> 02:45:01.454]  It's being dissolved.
[02:45:02.315 --> 02:45:07.818]  The powers are being transferred to international bodies, and then the due process is being erased.
[02:45:07.858 --> 02:45:11.761]  You know, a lot of these liberals will go, well, of course I'm for well government.
[02:45:11.841 --> 02:45:15.083]  It's the next step in evolution of civilization.
[02:45:15.683 --> 02:45:16.084]  No.
[02:45:16.884 --> 02:45:28.628]  They are abolishing due process, Bill of Rights, Constitution, public institutions, and transferring it all to a handful of private corporations that operate as global organized crime syndicates.
[02:45:28.648 --> 02:45:29.889]  Let's jam another call in here.
[02:45:30.189 --> 02:45:31.450]  Let's talk to Mark in Canada.
[02:45:31.470 --> 02:45:32.530]  You're on the air with Eric Schein.
[02:45:32.570 --> 02:45:32.950]  Go ahead.
[02:45:32.970 --> 02:45:33.850]  Hi Alex.
[02:45:33.970 --> 02:45:35.051]  How are you doing?
[02:45:36.151 --> 02:45:36.331]  Good.
[02:45:36.371 --> 02:45:37.232]  What's on your mind today?
[02:45:37.712 --> 02:45:40.773]  Well, I just want to call in and say that it's about Rosie.
[02:45:41.538 --> 02:45:49.263]  I was the one who penned the petition to the BBC regarding the WTC7 Jane Stanley footage.
[02:45:50.304 --> 02:45:51.605]  I put it online.
[02:45:51.625 --> 02:46:00.190]  Well, anyways... For those that don't know, we're trying to get the BBC to answer questions about it, why they reported that Building 7 had fallen 20 plus minutes before it did.
[02:46:00.570 --> 02:46:03.892]  Yeah, and I posted five questions for them.
[02:46:04.753 --> 02:46:05.994]  So far I've received 3,600 signatures.
[02:46:08.340 --> 02:46:10.441]  Did the BBC ever answer your questions?
[02:46:10.621 --> 02:46:12.162]  No, I'm calling them pretty soon.
[02:46:12.202 --> 02:46:16.803]  I was actually shooting for $20,000 before I called, but I think I'm going to call them now just because it's slowed down.
[02:46:17.984 --> 02:46:22.946]  But Rosie signed my petition about three days before she started posting to her blog.
[02:46:23.006 --> 02:46:27.688]  And I remember that somebody put a post out about, you know, was it Rosie who really signed the petition?
[02:46:27.828 --> 02:46:29.209]  You know, that's newsworthy.
[02:46:29.249 --> 02:46:30.209]  Where is that petition?
[02:46:30.869 --> 02:46:32.650]  It is petitiononline.com.
[02:46:34.264 --> 02:46:39.305]  Well, see that's how this works.
[02:46:39.425 --> 02:46:48.328]  Charlie Sheen goes public, then we have a C-SPAN show, then it gets bigger, then BBC information comes out, then Rosie goes public, then more people go public.
[02:46:49.928 --> 02:47:03.031]  That's sort of what I wanted to say because like she posted on my petition, a couple days later she came out, and then just three days ago I'm getting emails from my buddies who are skeptics, who just think I'm full of it when I go on, you know?
[02:47:03.556 --> 02:47:10.647]  And they're linking the Rosie thing, and when I call them, of course, they're like, yeah, well, you know, she's not sounding crazy, she's not sounding stupid, you know?
[02:47:11.653 --> 02:47:16.594]  So it took Rosie to get through to them, and they don't know her, but I know her, and they didn't listen to me.
[02:47:16.614 --> 02:47:18.715]  Good job, good job, I appreciate your call.
[02:47:19.155 --> 02:47:21.936]  You know, Eric Schein, do you see a collision happening, though?
[02:47:21.976 --> 02:47:28.238]  Because I see the world is waking up to this paradigm, slowly but surely, and I see a collision.
[02:47:28.518 --> 02:47:29.918]  When do you think we'll see that clash?
[02:47:30.018 --> 02:47:35.200]  Or are they trying to beat us to the chase by setting up their police state now to physically block us?
[02:47:36.010 --> 02:47:37.771]  Well, that clash is already going on.
[02:47:37.791 --> 02:47:41.492]  There's a lot of people out here who are confronting this head-on in all ways.
[02:47:43.853 --> 02:47:45.093]  That's why they're stepping things up.
[02:47:45.113 --> 02:47:49.595]  That's why you see that movement towards... Why do you think they want to have Giuliani as president?
[02:47:49.635 --> 02:47:50.415]  He's a fascist.
[02:47:51.178 --> 02:47:51.978]  He's a corporatist.
[02:47:51.998 --> 02:47:53.099]  He's an industrialist.
[02:47:54.140 --> 02:47:57.201]  Or, you know, even people like trying to bring in Romney or others.
[02:47:57.461 --> 02:47:58.662]  Even Clinton is.
[02:47:58.742 --> 02:48:00.863]  Hillary Clinton is a collectivist.
[02:48:01.183 --> 02:48:04.525]  She believes in big government, big business, big insurance.
[02:48:05.145 --> 02:48:10.368]  Even, you know, Obama has come out and he's talked about administrative changes.
[02:48:10.408 --> 02:48:12.909]  He's talked about insurance and tweaking insurance.
[02:48:13.391 --> 02:48:22.318]  Rather than an overhaul and returning, you know, levels of due process and taking them out of administrative hands to where we can get into our courts if we need to.
[02:48:22.698 --> 02:48:27.362]  Because we've had this whole propaganda campaign against us that all complaints are frivolous.
[02:48:27.682 --> 02:48:30.684]  Like the one about the woman who got burned at McDonald's with the coffee.
[02:48:31.845 --> 02:48:36.268]  You know, if you really look into what really happened there, she was truly burned.
[02:48:36.468 --> 02:48:37.289]  Third degree burns.
[02:48:37.309 --> 02:48:39.190]  You know, pretty bad.
[02:48:39.931 --> 02:48:41.212]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[02:48:41.432 --> 02:48:42.593]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:48.092 --> 02:48:48.552]  It's here!
[02:48:48.773 --> 02:48:53.557]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:53.917 --> 02:49:01.544]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.259 --> 02:49:09.301]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.702 --> 02:49:21.105]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.445 --> 02:49:25.387]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.407 --> 02:49:27.327]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.668 --> 02:49:31.509]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:54.130 --> 02:51:56.012]  Look at your women crying.
[02:51:56.052 --> 02:51:59.754]  Look at your young men dying.

[02:52:39.127 --> 02:52:41.288]  Got to get Eric Schein back up again in the near future.
[02:52:41.808 --> 02:52:42.649]  Very interesting fellow.
[02:52:42.689 --> 02:52:44.770]  He's got a show on 3 to 5 p.m.
[02:52:44.790 --> 02:52:45.190]  Saturdays.
[02:52:45.270 --> 02:52:46.471]  Eric, keep riding the shotgun with us.
[02:52:46.511 --> 02:52:47.571]  I want to race through some calls.
[02:52:47.952 --> 02:52:49.012]  David in California.
[02:52:49.052 --> 02:52:49.693]  You're on the air.
[02:52:49.753 --> 02:52:50.153]  Go ahead.
[02:52:51.155 --> 02:52:51.755]  Good morning, Eric.
[02:52:51.975 --> 02:52:52.916]  I'm sorry, Alex.
[02:52:53.096 --> 02:52:54.237]  I've got two things for you.
[02:52:54.737 --> 02:52:58.679]  First, here's a number for all you 9-11 truthers out there to support Rosie.
[02:52:58.779 --> 02:52:59.699]  Grab your pens.
[02:53:00.240 --> 02:53:02.841]  And while you're grabbing them, Rosie... What number is this first?
[02:53:03.461 --> 02:53:03.761]  Oh, yes.
[02:53:04.101 --> 02:53:04.522]  Excuse me?
[02:53:05.422 --> 02:53:06.763]  Whose number is it?
[02:53:06.963 --> 02:53:09.724]  It's the number to ABC, specifically for The View.
[02:53:09.744 --> 02:53:11.225]  Oh, yeah, because they're saying fire.
[02:53:11.285 --> 02:53:12.286]  Sure, go ahead and give the number out.
[02:53:12.586 --> 02:53:12.966]  Okay.
[02:53:12.986 --> 02:53:13.286]  818-460-7477.
[02:53:13.366 --> 02:53:13.886]  Then you press 2.
[02:53:19.758 --> 02:53:23.701]  Then you press 4, and then to get to the view, it's 849.
[02:53:24.001 --> 02:53:31.087]  So that's 818-460-7477, then 2, then 4, then 849.
[02:53:31.467 --> 02:53:34.049]  And for Rosie, Rosie, open up your blog!
[02:53:34.909 --> 02:53:39.052]  The 9-11 Truthers will take down all the people that are attacking you, no problem.
[02:53:39.453 --> 02:53:42.275]  It was done at the United Flight 93 Forum.
[02:53:43.015 --> 02:53:44.957]  So come on, Rosie, you know, get on board.
[02:53:45.632 --> 02:53:48.234]  And I got one more thing for you, Alex, that you'll get a kick out of.
[02:53:48.575 --> 02:53:50.156]  Just boot me off when you've heard enough.
[02:53:50.196 --> 02:53:52.979]  It goes on for about three minutes, and I can't hear you while my player runs.
[02:53:52.999 --> 02:53:53.539]  Well, what is it?
[02:53:53.559 --> 02:53:54.480]  I mean, I gotta go to other calls.
[02:53:54.500 --> 02:53:55.041]  We're out of time.
[02:53:55.241 --> 02:53:56.702]  Okay, just go ahead and go to the calls.
[02:53:56.722 --> 02:53:57.123]  Thanks, man.
[02:53:57.403 --> 02:53:57.803]  Thank you.
[02:53:57.863 --> 02:53:58.164]  Yeah, I'll call.
[02:53:58.184 --> 02:53:59.685]  Can I throw in two cents real quick?
[02:53:59.705 --> 02:54:00.205]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:54:01.006 --> 02:54:02.888]  Well, I have to go pick up a document today.
[02:54:02.928 --> 02:54:04.369]  It's coming in from Homeland Security.
[02:54:04.389 --> 02:54:04.690]  The U.S.
[02:54:04.710 --> 02:54:07.152]  Coast Guard's been prosecuting me for the last four years.
[02:54:07.836 --> 02:54:11.877]  For quote-unquote being depressed, they've stolen medical records, seized medical records and more.
[02:54:12.357 --> 02:54:17.458]  I have to go see what this document is about, but they've fired up this whole thing again to try to stifle me, shut me up.
[02:54:18.138 --> 02:54:28.921]  If people can go to www.martialaw911.com, M-A-R-T-I-A-L-L-A-W-911.com, on there is the name for the administrative law judge who's been brought in.
[02:54:29.801 --> 02:54:30.901]  He's tied to Iran.
[02:54:30.981 --> 02:54:32.322]  Is that your website?
[02:54:33.522 --> 02:54:33.682]  Yeah.
[02:54:34.446 --> 02:54:35.606]  Well, that's a great name!
[02:54:35.686 --> 02:54:37.567]  MarshallLaw911.com.
[02:54:37.887 --> 02:54:38.447]  Fantastic!
[02:54:38.487 --> 02:54:39.527]  We'll have folks check that.
[02:54:39.827 --> 02:54:40.748]  Chris in New York.
[02:54:40.788 --> 02:54:41.528]  Chris, go ahead.
[02:54:42.208 --> 02:54:43.348]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:54:43.588 --> 02:54:50.490]  I'm just saying, if you hadn't heard, there was a show Friday, March 30th at WWRL, 5.30am to about 9am.
[02:54:51.050 --> 02:54:53.131]  It's called the Salmon Army Show.
[02:54:53.651 --> 02:54:55.871]  Armstrong Williams and Sam Greenfield.
[02:54:56.411 --> 02:54:59.132]  They had a poll on, do the people believe
[02:55:00.016 --> 02:55:04.897]  9-11 and the consensus, especially, that everyone was exposing, they didn't believe it.
[02:55:06.898 --> 02:55:11.099]  I don't know, that's a... That is one of the better radio stations in New York.
[02:55:11.219 --> 02:55:14.340]  Yeah, you're sending out a test and the majority didn't buy the official story.
[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:15.140]  Right.
[02:55:16.181 --> 02:55:23.983]  Well, every call they've had... Arnton Williams, though, Arnton Williams was the guy that the Bush administration was paying for doing propaganda.
[02:55:24.523 --> 02:55:25.403]  No, no, I understand that.
[02:55:25.443 --> 02:55:26.103]  I've been on his show.
[02:55:28.505 --> 02:55:32.788]  Uh, Sam Greenfield is the person that was trying to discredit any person that called you.
[02:55:32.808 --> 02:55:35.791]  Yeah, well, you know, regardless, regardless, he's bringing up a poll.
[02:55:35.851 --> 02:55:37.432]  We're talking about a poll and where the poll was.
[02:55:38.232 --> 02:55:40.414]  Uh, every poll I've seen now is above 80%.
[02:55:40.494 --> 02:55:41.175]  All the new polls.
[02:55:41.195 --> 02:55:43.637]  Like, I just saw a site last night that had them all listed.
[02:55:43.657 --> 02:55:44.697]  I remember seeing all the polls.
[02:55:44.717 --> 02:55:45.578]  It was amazing.
[02:55:45.778 --> 02:55:47.399]  Hey, Eric Schein, thanks for joining us, man.
[02:55:47.439 --> 02:55:47.980]  Take care, bro.
[02:55:48.795 --> 02:55:49.596]  Good luck with everything.
[02:55:50.016 --> 02:55:50.316]  You bet.
[02:55:50.356 --> 02:55:50.777]  Take care.
[02:55:52.818 --> 02:55:53.899]  I can't talk to Peter and Ben.
[02:55:53.919 --> 02:55:54.700]  We're just out of time.
[02:55:55.180 --> 02:55:58.883]  I'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 2, Central Standard Time.
[02:56:00.004 --> 02:56:01.245]  I hope you will join us.
[02:56:01.265 --> 02:56:02.726]  I hope you'll spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:56:02.746 --> 02:56:05.669]  We've got some big guests lined up this week and a lot of news.
[02:56:06.670 --> 02:56:10.613]  We've got more of the intimidation of Rosie O'Donnell by
[02:56:11.408 --> 02:56:15.491]  The monster, the fake conservative Bill O'Reilly at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:15.971 --> 02:56:18.032]  Get that story and get it out to everybody.
[02:56:18.612 --> 02:56:20.454]  Alright, get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:20.514 --> 02:56:21.254]  God bless you all.
