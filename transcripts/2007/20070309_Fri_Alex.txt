[00:00:05.211 --> 00:00:05.872]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.512 --> 00:00:07.613]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:09.415]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.055 --> 00:00:10.896]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:12.537]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:17.181]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:21.484]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.195 --> 00:00:34.581]  Yeah, I think.
[00:00:40.112 --> 00:00:41.452]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:41.953]  Welcome.
[00:00:42.353 --> 00:00:45.994]  It is Friday, the ninth day of March 2007.
[00:00:46.974 --> 00:00:48.254]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:48.274 --> 00:00:51.755]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, and we're going to have open phones.
[00:00:52.415 --> 00:01:08.079]  For 30 minutes in the second hour, we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson, who was able to see a highly anticipated, what he says was a very well-done documentary that aired on Channel 4 in England, that's separate from BBC, one of the private channels.
[00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:21.055]  Exposing the fact, just codifying a lot of the documentation and data and science we already knew, that global warming is a complete and total hoax and a gigantic fraud.
[00:01:22.777 --> 00:01:26.760]  Now we're not saying there isn't global climate change because the earth hasn't heated up a few degrees.
[00:01:27.532 --> 00:01:32.255]  What is proven is that it is the sun that is causing it.
[00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:33.276]  Period.
[00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:34.717]  End of debate.
[00:01:35.257 --> 00:01:46.684]  Every major scientist, Nobel Prize winners, climatologists, people who are not on big oil company payrolls are saying it's a fraud.
[00:01:47.044 --> 00:01:49.846]  And for the greenie weenies out there listening, you're going, wait a minute!
[00:01:50.447 --> 00:01:53.508]  The big oil companies, they fight against global warming.
[00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:55.310]  They say that it isn't real.
[00:01:56.528 --> 00:02:03.651]  Maybe out of one side of their mouth very quietly to fool you they do, but they're really behind the big environmental movement and they want a global tax.
[00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:11.754]  And we have their own Bilderberg, CFR, SPP, NAU documents to prove it.
[00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:14.755]  So that's coming up in the second hour.
[00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:18.597]  We have three clips from the documentary.
[00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:23.759]  We're obviously not going to air an hour long documentary here, but we're going to air a few clips of it to analyze it.
[00:02:24.887 --> 00:02:28.629]  Coming up when Paul Watson joins us in the next hour.
[00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.555]  In the meantime, there's a bunch of propaganda out today about trade deficit drops and oh my gosh, the net worth of U.S.
[00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:40.396]  households skyrockets.
[00:02:41.216 --> 00:02:48.841]  A bunch of financial propaganda that's out today that I want to go over and basically break down.
[00:02:49.818 --> 00:02:51.439]  There's also a bunch of distractions.
[00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:56.522]  I'm not going to spend much time on, Gienrich had an affair during Clinton probe.
[00:02:57.022 --> 00:02:58.423]  Yeah, they're a bunch of hypocrites.
[00:02:59.123 --> 00:03:06.688]  And they shouldn't have gone after Clinton, as bad as it was, and as unprofessional, for the Monica Lewinsky situation.
[00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:13.892]  They should have gone after him for the Communist Chinese generals, basically running the Department of Commerce and all the murders.
[00:03:15.217 --> 00:03:17.058]  But just more hypocritical behavior.
[00:03:17.478 --> 00:03:19.859]  This out of Channel 2 out of Houston.
[00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.980]  Inmates may cut time by donating organs.
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.781]  You knew it would come.
[00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.102]  Here it is, the organ farms.
[00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:32.464]  Also, France has banned citizen journalists from reporting the news.
[00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:40.914]  We got a report today in this office about a young man videotaping a automobile accident.
[00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:45.015]  The cops came over and told him to turn his camera off, and he wouldn't, so they arrested him.
[00:03:45.435 --> 00:03:53.138]  So lots of cameras to watch us, but don't you point a camera at the Lord, at the gods, at the kings, the lords of our earth.
[00:03:54.098 --> 00:03:55.078]  You do that, you're in trouble.
[00:03:55.418 --> 00:04:05.602]  The Council on Foreign Relations, the organization sworn to destroy the United States, has put out a report by Daniel W. Gresner called the New New World Order.
[00:04:08.018 --> 00:04:12.161]  Always relabeling their old world order as people get wise to it.
[00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:15.183]  We'll be breaking that down too today.
[00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:20.967]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:20.987 --> 00:04:24.810]  And we don't screen your calls.
[00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.472]  We just ask what your first name is and where you're calling from.
[00:04:27.912 --> 00:04:35.117]  But if you would like to volunteer that you disagree with me, if you truly do, you will go to the head of the line because we invite that.
[00:04:35.177 --> 00:04:35.798]  We'd like to hear
[00:04:36.736 --> 00:04:39.899]  How you think we're wrong or to challenge us, occasionally we are corrected.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.262]  Unfortunately, most of the time we're right.
[00:04:42.362 --> 00:04:44.984]  We wish we were wrong about the state of affairs globally.
[00:04:45.004 --> 00:04:45.565]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.747]  Websites are jonesreport.com, infowars.net, and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:05:03.985 --> 00:05:09.474]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:17.466]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.163 --> 00:05:25.226]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:37.051]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:40.833]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.293 --> 00:05:43.254]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.594 --> 00:05:47.436]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:05:48.016 --> 00:05:55.489]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:00.572 --> 00:06:03.593]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:06:03.894 --> 00:06:08.816]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:06:09.076 --> 00:06:13.438]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:06:13.738 --> 00:06:22.642]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:06:22.842 --> 00:06:26.464]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:06:26.764 --> 00:06:31.767]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:06:32.087 --> 00:06:38.791]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:39.950]  What about you?
[00:06:40.591 --> 00:06:45.957]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:06:46.017 --> 00:06:47.098]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:49.020]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:07:00.183 --> 00:07:04.966]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[00:07:05.187 --> 00:07:09.169]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:15.734]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:07:15.974 --> 00:07:20.357]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.
[00:07:20.557 --> 00:07:25.781]  For a lot less than you'd expect, this portable system can chop up nearly a third of your electric bill.
[00:07:26.101 --> 00:07:31.604]  Getting yourself onto solar power is one of the most liberating things you can do for yourself and your family.
[00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:39.529]  The solar-powered generator will run your lights, fan, electric blanket, your refrigerator, and a whole slew of household items.
[00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:48.495]  Visit Ken's website at KenSolar.com for free downloads, free videos and how-to's, and of course the new solar-powered generator.

[00:08:01.802 --> 00:08:03.903]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.923 --> 00:08:07.285]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.527 --> 00:08:43.222]  The news is extremely rich today, rich with key data that only confirms on a hundred fronts what we already knew about the global crime syndicate's concerted efforts against humanity to corral, dumb down, and reduce our numbers.
[00:08:44.943 --> 00:08:48.146]  AIDS hits blacks harder than other groups, CDC,
[00:08:49.289 --> 00:08:58.991]  And the CDC says they don't know why that is, because blacks on average are only slightly more promiscuous than other sub-racial groups.
[00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:05.312]  But they are many, many, many, many more times likely to get it.
[00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:12.153]  Yeah, you've got people that they've done major tests, it's been in major publications in Africa, of virgins.
[00:09:13.033 --> 00:09:17.714]  Virgin males and females who are ten years old and have AIDS.
[00:09:18.849 --> 00:09:20.069]  Their parents don't have it.
[00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.891]  They've got it, and of course they've had their special inoculations, though.
[00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:37.254]  You've got some countries where 45% of the population has it, and blacks get it more often when they have blood transfusions that are tainted with it.
[00:09:37.274 --> 00:09:39.335]  You don't always get it when you're exposed, by the way.
[00:09:40.255 --> 00:09:47.937]  And it also affects Asians and the different subgroups of Asian genetics.
[00:09:49.127 --> 00:09:53.751]  Again, most people in Latin America don't know that they're a mix of European and Asian.
[00:09:55.452 --> 00:09:57.374]  That's where the population is originally derived from.
[00:09:57.414 --> 00:09:58.495]  It's the same genetic code.
[00:09:58.515 --> 00:09:59.535]  They're much more likely to get it.
[00:09:59.916 --> 00:10:02.778]  But it seems to be tailored for blacks.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:16.088]  And, of course, we have the documents from the 1970s where it was developed, and those have been declassified, a race-specific, sexually transmitted, autoimmune bioweapon.
[00:10:18.803 --> 00:10:21.343]  And the numbers here show that that is indeed the fact.
[00:10:23.364 --> 00:10:24.844]  So we'll get into that a little bit later.
[00:10:24.864 --> 00:10:27.465]  Another story from the BBC.
[00:10:27.525 --> 00:10:29.865]  Subliminal images impact on the brain.
[00:10:29.885 --> 00:10:34.746]  FBI underreported use of Patriot Act abused it.
[00:10:35.126 --> 00:10:36.486]  The thing itself is abusive.
[00:10:36.826 --> 00:10:38.887]  Firefighters Union shuns Giuliani.
[00:10:38.907 --> 00:10:39.827]  They don't want him to speak.
[00:10:41.967 --> 00:10:46.748]  We'll be getting into the global warming hoax as it continues to unravel while it's pushed at fever pitch.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.502]  But let me get into some economic indicators and indices first.
[00:10:53.424 --> 00:10:53.724]  U.S.
[00:10:53.784 --> 00:10:56.886]  trade deficit shrinks to $59.1 billion.
[00:10:58.367 --> 00:10:59.668]  This is AP.
[00:11:00.929 --> 00:11:02.831]  Unemployment rate drops to 4.5%.
[00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:06.573]  Net worth of U.S.
[00:11:06.613 --> 00:11:08.395]  households skyrockets.
[00:11:10.856 --> 00:11:14.419]  These are the type of reports I have in front of me.
[00:11:15.657 --> 00:11:17.898]  But then you have other little numbers I don't want you to look at.
[00:11:17.918 --> 00:11:19.098]  This is out of the New York Times.
[00:11:19.558 --> 00:11:23.519]  Violent crime in cities shows sharp surge.
[00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:38.783]  And if you look at announced and unannounced recessions or depressions globally, especially in the western world, you know that there is a sharp increase in crime during downturns in the economy.
[00:11:39.343 --> 00:11:42.704]  That's just a basic societal, socio-economic
[00:11:43.468 --> 00:11:47.990]  Fact that has been well known for thousands of years by social planners.
[00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.771]  So let's go through these numbers.
[00:11:50.871 --> 00:11:51.131]  U.S.
[00:11:51.171 --> 00:11:54.232]  trade deficit shrinks to $59.1 billion.
[00:11:54.712 --> 00:11:54.972]  The U.S.
[00:11:54.992 --> 00:11:57.693]  trade deficit narrowed 3.8% in January.
[00:11:58.434 --> 00:11:58.834]  Wow!
[00:11:59.234 --> 00:11:58.834]  3.8%!
[00:11:59.414 --> 00:12:01.455]  Oh, so massive!
[00:12:02.295 --> 00:12:07.457]  Billion dollars thanks to record-breaking export growth, the Commerce Department said Friday.
[00:12:08.582 --> 00:12:18.584]  It was a bigger drop than expected on Wall Street where analysts saw a deficit of $60.0 billion and marked the steepest change in the trade figure since October.
[00:12:18.744 --> 00:12:26.426]  Now, that's like saying jumping off a one-inch step and falling one inch.
[00:12:26.466 --> 00:12:33.247]  That's like calling that an incredible plunge or it's like saying you stepped up an inch was why he scaled the heights.
[00:12:35.848 --> 00:12:37.868]  They are comparing this to previous
[00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:45.356]  Yes, certainly, if you have a massive reduction in dollar value, it will encourage some
[00:13:07.592 --> 00:13:20.336]  Development, but it'd kind of be like having a blood transfusion of one cc of blood while your leg was chopped off and you dumped a gallon and a half on the street.
[00:13:21.796 --> 00:13:25.117]  So they're running around going, blood transfusion of one cc!
[00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:35.600]  Oh my gosh, several, several drops, several dozen drops of blood while huge geysers of blood
[00:13:37.836 --> 00:13:39.396]  Pump out on the street corner.
[00:13:41.637 --> 00:13:47.218]  I mean, it's a total... This is just more of the propaganda they're constantly putting out.
[00:13:47.718 --> 00:13:50.139]  Take the unemployment numbers.
[00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:59.661]  When you've been off the rolls for several months, they're constantly changing it, but sometimes it's six weeks, sometimes it's five months, sometimes it's eight months.
[00:14:00.782 --> 00:14:01.982]  They're always messing with it, but
[00:14:02.631 --> 00:14:17.558]  When you've been off of the welfare rolls, or you haven't gone on the welfare rolls, or you've gone off the unemployment roll for a short period of time, then you are counted as employed.
[00:14:17.598 --> 00:14:18.599]  You are counted.
[00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:22.460]  And that is an admitted fact of their bookkeeping.
[00:14:23.341 --> 00:14:27.383]  And we've talked a lot about how the stock market's at $11,000 something.
[00:14:28.443 --> 00:14:29.644]  It's gone down a bit lately.
[00:14:29.664 --> 00:14:31.024]  It went well over $12,000.
[00:14:33.058 --> 00:14:37.461]  And then they tell you, oh my gosh, the stock market's doing so well, but that's the Dow Jones Industrial 30.
[00:14:37.862 --> 00:14:42.145]  They only put winners into the Dow Jones Industrial 30, removing losers.
[00:14:45.507 --> 00:14:54.974]  And even the Dow Jones 30 is vastly overinflated, because you've got a doubling plus.
[00:14:55.354 --> 00:15:00.958]  Since they doubled it, they then made the number secret, but announced they were going to increase money supply even at a greater rate.
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:07.041]  So, if you have a doubling of the money supply, that's why you're going to still have housing prices go up.
[00:15:07.441 --> 00:15:12.662]  That's why you're still going to have stocks go up, because those inflated dollars are trying to find real assets.
[00:15:13.042 --> 00:15:21.324]  Even if they're grossly inflated, still you can't completely, in all cases, deflate them down to zero like you can a fiat currency.
[00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:24.785]  So, U.S.
[00:15:24.825 --> 00:15:26.705]  trade deficit shrinks to 59.1 billion dollars from
[00:15:33.061 --> 00:15:35.101]  Just a few billion above that.
[00:15:35.202 --> 00:15:40.603]  So it's... they're calling this a record.
[00:15:41.043 --> 00:15:41.283]  U.S.
[00:15:41.303 --> 00:15:43.623]  trade deficit shrinks to 59.1 billion dollars.
[00:15:44.104 --> 00:15:44.244]  U.S.
[00:15:44.264 --> 00:15:54.986]  trade deficit narrowed 3.8 percent in January to 59.1 billion dollars thanks to record-breaking export growth, the Commerce Department said Friday.
[00:15:55.326 --> 00:15:59.407]  And that's record-breaking in the last year.
[00:16:00.569 --> 00:16:02.931]  So they go, oh my gosh, it's record-breaking!
[00:16:03.331 --> 00:16:04.412]  It's record-breaking!
[00:16:04.492 --> 00:16:07.114]  A few more exports were sent out.
[00:16:07.134 --> 00:16:10.776]  We still have a giant deficit, but there's been a few more exports, so everything's fine.
[00:16:12.758 --> 00:16:21.904]  It was a bigger drop than expected on Wall Street, where analysts saw a deficit of $60.0 billion and marked the steepest change in the trade figure since October.
[00:16:23.265 --> 00:16:24.046]  Again, a couple months.
[00:16:24.978 --> 00:16:29.381]  An improving trade picture could be good for the first quarter U.S.
[00:16:29.441 --> 00:16:33.804]  economic growth, as higher deficit subtracts from gross domestic product.
[00:16:34.324 --> 00:16:38.086]  Total imports fell 0.5% to $1.858 billion last month, while exports jumped 1.1% to a new record of $126.7 billion.
[00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:38.466]  Oh my gosh!
[00:16:38.486 --> 00:16:38.967]  Oh, it jumped!
[00:16:38.987 --> 00:16:38.967]  1.1%!
[00:16:39.387 --> 00:16:39.547]  Oh my!
[00:16:54.697 --> 00:16:54.977]  U.S.
[00:16:55.057 --> 00:17:01.200]  exports of capital goods grew by $1.0 billion, and most of that, by the way, is weapons sales.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.202]  From December to January, consumer goods increased $500 million.
[00:17:06.782 --> 00:17:08.183]  Ooh, $500 million!
[00:17:08.243 --> 00:17:09.063]  Ooh, so big!
[00:17:09.543 --> 00:17:11.124]  That's nothing in the scale of things.
[00:17:11.164 --> 00:17:12.905]  Derivatives are tens of trillions a day.
[00:17:15.166 --> 00:17:17.947]  Feeds and beverages went up $300 million.
[00:17:18.347 --> 00:17:20.108]  Oh, we're eating more food!
[00:17:20.188 --> 00:17:21.508]  Man, we're really successful!
[00:17:22.149 --> 00:17:22.789]  But American
[00:17:23.931 --> 00:17:29.272]  Politically sensitive deficit with China surged 12% to $21.3 billion with U.S.
[00:17:29.292 --> 00:17:32.753]  consumers as hungry as ever for cheap Chinese products.
[00:17:34.334 --> 00:17:34.754]  The U.S.
[00:17:34.774 --> 00:17:41.655]  deficit with the European Union slumped 28% to $6.5 billion while the shortfall with Canada grew 23% to $6.9 billion.
[00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:46.556]  Overall, the United States imported fewer vehicles, parts, and engines.
[00:17:46.617 --> 00:17:48.537]  We don't have money now, we're being debased.
[00:17:49.432 --> 00:17:52.933]  And consumer goods down by 1.4 billion in January.
[00:17:52.993 --> 00:17:55.954]  See, you actually read deeper and the news is real bad.
[00:17:57.954 --> 00:18:03.376]  That's just one article, basic economics, that anyone with half a brain could understand.
[00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:06.577]  But don't tell that to some good old boy who thinks he knows it all.
[00:18:06.977 --> 00:18:07.737]  Here's another one again.
[00:18:07.757 --> 00:18:08.677]  Unemployment rate drops 4.5%.
[00:18:08.777 --> 00:18:09.357]  It drops to 4.5%.
[00:18:09.397 --> 00:18:11.778]  That is a moderate unemployment rate.
[00:18:16.616 --> 00:18:21.939]  But then when you find out the numbers completely fake, because once you go off the unemployment rolls, you're counted as employed.
[00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:23.540]  Completely false.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:33.965]  The nation's unemployment rate dipped to 4.5% in February, even as big losses of construction and factory jobs restrained overall payroll growth, wages grew briskly.
[00:18:34.885 --> 00:18:45.431]  Now you've got again, the dollar being devalued by close to 50%, and then they tell you how your wages shot up, which are just a few percentage points,
[00:18:47.128 --> 00:18:50.770]  And they tell you how the unemployment rate went down.
[00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.171]  I mean, this is a joke.
[00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:58.455]  The latest snapshot released by the Labor Department on Friday offered a somewhat mixed picture of the employment climate.
[00:18:58.755 --> 00:19:09.061]  The slight decline in the politically prominent job rate from 4.6% in January came as hundreds of thousands of people left the workforce for various reasons.
[00:19:11.222 --> 00:19:13.924]  And there's all these big layoffs from Ford to GM to
[00:19:14.893 --> 00:19:16.594]  Different semiconductor makers.
[00:19:16.934 --> 00:19:29.579]  Employers, meanwhile, added 97,000 new jobs to their payrolls in February, the fewest in two years, as bad winter weather forced construction companies to slash 62,000 jobs.
[00:19:29.619 --> 00:19:34.161]  But again, that's just over two-thirds of that is illegal aliens.
[00:19:34.181 --> 00:19:43.845]  Those numbers were out yesterday, so... Factories, feeling the strain of the troubled housing and auto industries, also continue to cut jobs.
[00:19:44.602 --> 00:19:52.688]  So you read this, and it's a positive headline, but they can't lie about base numbers, so... But don't worry, net worth to U.S.
[00:19:52.728 --> 00:19:54.429]  households skyrockets!
[00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:59.453]  And again, the dollar's been devalued, so of course, we'll explain when we get back.
[00:20:01.912 --> 00:20:02.893]  Good morning, honey!
[00:20:03.233 --> 00:20:03.794]  Wow!
[00:20:03.954 --> 00:20:09.239]  The weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[00:20:09.519 --> 00:20:10.119]  Yeah.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.941]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:15.704]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel brookie system.
[00:20:16.165 --> 00:20:17.646]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[00:20:18.106 --> 00:20:19.808]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[00:20:20.208 --> 00:20:21.950]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.090]  Honey, cheer up!
[00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.691]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:20:25.971 --> 00:20:26.271]  What?
[00:20:26.711 --> 00:20:37.195]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:20:37.475 --> 00:20:37.715]  You know?
[00:20:38.175 --> 00:20:39.657]  This is a terrific cabin!
[00:20:39.857 --> 00:20:40.738]  And wow!
[00:20:40.898 --> 00:20:42.339]  Have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[00:20:42.639 --> 00:20:43.820]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.722]  Hi, Ted Andersen from Midas Resources.
[00:21:03.802 --> 00:21:04.462]  It's March 9th, 2007.
[00:21:04.522 --> 00:21:05.023]  Gold is at $651.40.
[00:21:05.063 --> 00:21:06.744]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $674.68.
[00:21:06.784 --> 00:21:08.426]  $339.86 for half ounce and $169.93 for quarter ounce coins at $674.68, $339.86, $169.93.
[00:21:19.836 --> 00:21:23.458]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[00:21:23.518 --> 00:21:26.540]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:35.806]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[00:21:36.127 --> 00:21:41.450]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.231]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:46.751]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[00:21:47.132 --> 00:21:50.453]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.513 --> 00:21:54.234]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[00:21:54.274 --> 00:21:54.554]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.574 --> 00:21:54.754]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:07.233 --> 00:22:12.415]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:22:13.396 --> 00:22:17.477]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[00:22:17.938 --> 00:22:26.601]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[00:22:27.402 --> 00:22:32.684]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:40.873]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:48.315 --> 00:22:48.916]  Just call right now.
[00:23:02.153 --> 00:23:04.196]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:04.836 --> 00:23:13.767]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:14.207 --> 00:23:21.416]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:22.111 --> 00:23:27.615]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:28.095 --> 00:23:38.943]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.

[00:23:58.096 --> 00:24:07.162]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:07.822 --> 00:24:10.143]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:12.228 --> 00:24:28.894]  The press is reporting that there are now 960-plus billionaires in the world, and that's partly because the elite is consolidating the wealth, but mainly due to the fact that the dollar, again, has been doubled.
[00:24:29.555 --> 00:24:33.256]  Its currency has been at least doubled in the last six years.
[00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:35.937]  It's the same reason you read this.
[00:24:35.957 --> 00:24:37.057]  Net worth of U.S.
[00:24:37.117 --> 00:24:38.778]  households skyrockets.
[00:24:41.033 --> 00:24:42.733]  And it goes on to report, the net worth of U.S.
[00:24:42.773 --> 00:24:51.095]  households climbed to a record high in the final quarter of last year, boosted mostly by gains on stocks, the Federal Reserve reported Thursday.
[00:24:51.655 --> 00:25:00.097]  So you have a doubling in the money supply conservatively, and so you have stocks increasing, and they say, oh my gosh, net worth skyrockets.
[00:25:01.957 --> 00:25:08.879]  But the federal government put out numbers a few months ago that overall we are a debtor nation privately, and that we have a higher debt
[00:25:09.668 --> 00:25:16.931]  Versus earnings and savings ratio, a huge negative, higher than the depths of 1933 at the worst point in the depression.
[00:25:18.531 --> 00:25:21.572]  So again, a totally fake headline.
[00:25:22.232 --> 00:25:25.273]  No basis in reality.
[00:25:26.214 --> 00:25:27.254]  This from Yahoo News.
[00:25:27.634 --> 00:25:28.635]  The net worth of U.S.
[00:25:28.655 --> 00:25:32.496]  households climbed to a record high in the final quarter of last year.
[00:25:33.391 --> 00:25:35.472]  And by the way, it's already dropped, so that's not even the case.
[00:25:35.772 --> 00:25:38.393]  Boosted mostly by gains on stocks, the Federal Reserve reported.
[00:25:38.853 --> 00:25:51.398]  Net worth, the difference between households' total assets, such as houses and bank accounts, and their total liabilities, such as mortgages and credit card debt, totaled $55.6 trillion in October to December quarter.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.781]  Now, what would that $55.6 trillion
[00:26:00.888 --> 00:26:10.617]  I've been worth roughly six and a half years ago, it would have been worth about twenty eight trillion dollars.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.281]  But the money supply has doubled.
[00:26:15.481 --> 00:26:23.629]  But we have true inflationary points in housing, in energy, in everything.
[00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:25.591]  It's just not real.
[00:26:27.282 --> 00:26:28.723]  I just can't believe every day.
[00:26:28.763 --> 00:26:29.963]  I've got like four more articles.
[00:26:29.983 --> 00:26:33.585]  They just pump out all these lies and people just believe it.
[00:26:35.986 --> 00:26:38.707]  And it only is going to make it worse when things finally bottom out.
[00:26:42.248 --> 00:26:48.250]  But we really are living in a false reality when it comes to economic numbers in this country and on this planet.
[00:26:49.631 --> 00:26:51.232]  Alright, let me get into this report now.
[00:26:51.792 --> 00:26:54.333]  Violent crime in cities shows sharp surge
[00:26:55.774 --> 00:27:08.903]  This out of the New York Times, violent crime rose by double digit percentages in cities across the country over the last two years, reversing the declines of the mid to late 1990s, according to a new report by a prominent national law enforcement association.
[00:27:09.283 --> 00:27:19.470]  While overall crime has been declined nationwide, police officers have been warning of a rise in murder, robbery, and gun assaults since 2005, particularly in mid-sized cities in the Midwest,
[00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:23.753]  Now they say two years of data indicates the spike is more than an aberration.
[00:27:24.013 --> 00:27:35.160]  There are pockets of crime in this country that are astounding, said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which is releasing the report on Friday.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:43.886]  It's gone under the radar screen, but it's not if you're living on the north side of Minneapolis or the south side of Los Angeles or in Dorchester, Mass.
[00:27:44.696 --> 00:27:50.321]  Local police departments blame several factors, the spread of methamphetamine use in some Midwestern and Western cities.
[00:27:50.421 --> 00:27:51.322]  It's gangs, folks.
[00:27:51.843 --> 00:27:57.008]  And he goes on to say, gangs, high poverty and a record number of people being released from prison.
[00:27:57.348 --> 00:28:05.015]  But the biggest theme, they say, is easy access to guns and a willingness, even an eagerness, to settle disputes with them, particularly among young people.
[00:28:05.055 --> 00:28:08.679]  You mean ethnic gangs, but you don't want to say that.
[00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:19.617]  Don't want to report the facts, just get more federal funds and run random checkpoints searching citizens' cars who want to defend themselves from the carjackers.
[00:28:21.158 --> 00:28:25.282]  Now when you see numbers start going back up, it lets you know the economy isn't doing well.
[00:28:25.923 --> 00:28:27.824]  And the cops were honest there.
[00:28:27.864 --> 00:28:30.286]  They said, yeah, it's increased poverty.
[00:28:30.306 --> 00:28:35.451]  Alright, I'm done talking about that.
[00:28:35.571 --> 00:28:36.512]  It's important
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.121]  We could talk all day about it, but we don't have time.
[00:28:40.381 --> 00:28:42.842]  AIDS hits blacks harder than other groups.
[00:28:43.402 --> 00:28:55.987]  Centers for Disease Control, African American men, are nearly seven times more likely, seven times, to be diagnosed with HIV than white men, according to a report by the U.S.
[00:28:56.007 --> 00:28:59.569]  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released on Thursday.
[00:28:59.609 --> 00:29:01.930]  Now, blacks in surveys, black males report,
[00:29:02.717 --> 00:29:03.638]  More sexual partners.
[00:29:03.698 --> 00:29:05.800]  I'm adding this from past articles I've read.
[00:29:06.701 --> 00:29:16.750]  But even if you go with some of the highest estimates of double the sexual partners, that would not account for a near seven-fold increase.
[00:29:18.032 --> 00:29:20.554]  Seven-fold increase.
[00:29:21.995 --> 00:29:24.998]  Seven-fold the amount of whites that have it.
[00:29:25.098 --> 00:29:25.639]  White males.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.621]  So we'll go over this when we get back.
[00:29:29.059 --> 00:29:30.519]  It's a bio-weapon.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.300]  It does affect whites.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.941]  But it's much harder.
[00:29:36.401 --> 00:29:38.022]  And I've talked to so many scientists on air.
[00:29:38.382 --> 00:29:39.942]  I don't mean black activist scientists.
[00:29:39.982 --> 00:29:42.543]  I mean scientists who are just looking at this.
[00:29:43.323 --> 00:29:44.583]  And we look at Africa.
[00:29:45.264 --> 00:29:47.344]  People who have no sexual activity have it.
[00:29:48.304 --> 00:29:49.485]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.905 --> 00:29:51.825]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.285 --> 00:29:53.886]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:57.507]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.741 --> 00:30:04.163]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:30:04.683 --> 00:30:07.986]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:30:08.366 --> 00:30:11.308]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:30:11.589 --> 00:30:17.974]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:30:18.034 --> 00:30:22.437]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:30:22.677 --> 00:30:27.019]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.801]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:30:29.821 --> 00:30:32.582]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:30:33.063 --> 00:30:35.604]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:30:35.644 --> 00:30:39.886]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:30:39.946 --> 00:30:40.787]  Treasury bonds.
[00:30:41.067 --> 00:30:45.711]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:30:45.871 --> 00:30:47.512]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:30:47.532 --> 00:30:49.514]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[00:31:00.823 --> 00:31:04.404]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:31:04.664 --> 00:31:05.505]  Look no further!
[00:31:05.825 --> 00:31:08.386]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:31:08.826 --> 00:31:17.249]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:31:17.329 --> 00:31:17.810]  We're good to go.
[00:31:34.793 --> 00:31:35.273]  I think so.
[00:32:01.494 --> 00:32:05.256]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[00:32:05.637 --> 00:32:12.961]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[00:32:13.401 --> 00:32:24.368]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[00:32:24.428 --> 00:32:24.828]  Central.
[00:32:25.228 --> 00:32:30.850]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:37.092]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[00:32:37.573 --> 00:32:42.314]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[00:32:42.694 --> 00:32:47.476]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[00:32:47.936 --> 00:32:49.217]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[00:32:49.297 --> 00:32:49.657]  Central.
[00:32:50.297 --> 00:32:57.760]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:08.204]  I wonder should I build a wall?
[00:33:15.728 --> 00:33:20.110]  Mother, should I run for president?
[00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:24.052]  Mother, should I trust the government?
[00:33:46.018 --> 00:33:56.427]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:13.471 --> 00:34:16.732]  Alright, David, Lucas, Eric, Chris, John, many others.
[00:34:19.213 --> 00:34:22.394]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.

[00:34:37.358 --> 00:34:41.779]  And I hope you will get the new videos we're carrying, four new films.
[00:34:44.266 --> 00:34:49.348]  9-11 Press for Truth, 9-11 Unanswered Questions, American Blackout.
[00:34:49.388 --> 00:34:52.909]  There's another great film about the Iraq War and how it's all run for profit.
[00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:59.332]  Great films that we are carrying up on the Secure Online Video and Bookstore Shopping Cart.
[00:35:00.512 --> 00:35:04.574]  Then of course, if you haven't gotten the DVD, you need America, Freedom to Fascism.
[00:35:04.994 --> 00:35:06.355]  It needs to be in your library.
[00:35:06.395 --> 00:35:07.035]  We offer that.
[00:35:07.855 --> 00:35:09.976]  When you get it, you get Terror Storm at half price.
[00:35:11.142 --> 00:35:28.853]  For $9.95, my new film, which is the best work out there on government-sponsored terror, covering the history of government-sponsored terror, then 7-7 in London, the latest 9-11 info, then propaganda, the police state, the brainwashing, how they want to go into Iran, all the facts, the information you need, a powerful film, a riveting film.

[00:35:30.635 --> 00:35:31.375]  Please make copies.
[00:35:31.415 --> 00:35:32.256]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:35:32.576 --> 00:35:34.157]  This is how we're going to affect change.
[00:35:34.197 --> 00:35:35.718]  This is how we're going to bring the globalists down.
[00:35:36.178 --> 00:35:40.500]  So again, just go peruse all the great t-shirts and bumper stickers and ball caps.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.161]  It's all about getting the word out.
[00:35:43.942 --> 00:35:45.502]  It's all about educating people.
[00:35:46.583 --> 00:35:48.764]  It's all about affecting change.
[00:35:49.965 --> 00:35:54.207]  The toll free number to order my documentaries is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:56.488 --> 00:36:04.111]  And you can also ask about all the other great videos and books by other researchers we carry and other filmmakers and authors.
[00:36:05.981 --> 00:36:11.743]  888-253-3139 or you can simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:36:11.783 --> 00:36:16.045]  And don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month, the cost of 2 or 3 cups of Starbucks coffee,
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.841]  You get all 15 of my films.
[00:36:33.861 --> 00:36:36.702]  You can download them in super high quality bandwidth, burn them to disk, or CD.
[00:36:36.742 --> 00:36:38.042]  Incredible activist tool.
[00:36:38.422 --> 00:36:39.903]  A factory of resistance.
[00:36:40.683 --> 00:36:42.924]  Hundreds and hundreds of my best audio interviews.
[00:36:43.064 --> 00:36:44.525]  Hundreds of weekly TV reports.
[00:36:45.545 --> 00:36:46.786]  It'll be three years in August.
[00:36:47.126 --> 00:36:51.208]  Three years in, not August, in April.
[00:36:51.228 --> 00:36:53.969]  I'm thinking about August, my deadline to finish this new film.
[00:36:55.699 --> 00:36:58.946]  So much is available there at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:59.547 --> 00:37:01.251]  Get your membership today, folks.
[00:37:01.331 --> 00:37:04.397]  In-studio video interviews of the on-air interviews we do.
[00:37:05.126 --> 00:37:06.967]  A bunch of other films have been authorized to post.
[00:37:07.407 --> 00:37:10.148]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:10.288 --> 00:37:11.408]  Take action today.
[00:37:11.469 --> 00:37:12.129]  Get your membership.
[00:37:12.149 --> 00:37:14.750]  And I want to thank all of you that have gotten the books and videos from the bookstore.
[00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:17.431]  I want to thank all of you that are PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:37:17.771 --> 00:37:19.572]  You make what we do here possible.
[00:37:19.952 --> 00:37:21.032]  You're having an effect.
[00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:23.953]  You're making things change for the better.
[00:37:24.354 --> 00:37:27.515]  You're on the field, in the arena, and I salute you.
[00:37:29.476 --> 00:37:32.897]  Alright, I want to get more into AIDS.
[00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:37.547]  Hits blacks harder than other groups, then we'll go to your calls.
[00:37:37.567 --> 00:37:40.187]  Then later, FBI, underreported use of Patriot Act.
[00:37:41.348 --> 00:37:45.389]  Subliminal images impact on the brain, BBC admitting it's manipulating and controlling you.
[00:37:46.509 --> 00:37:50.530]  Firefighters urge... Why I said urge?
[00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.211]  Firefighters union shuns Giuliani.
[00:37:53.231 --> 00:37:57.712]  They're going to have all the presidential candidates to speak to them, but they don't want Giuliani.
[00:37:57.732 --> 00:37:58.453]  We'll tell you why.
[00:37:59.313 --> 00:38:00.813]  Coming up, Paul Watson's got a sore throat.
[00:38:00.833 --> 00:38:02.974]  He'll only be with us a few minutes to give his take.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:11.925]  In the next hour on this incredible new documentary that's come out, breaking down how global warming, the way it's being pushed and presented as a fraud.
[00:38:13.445 --> 00:38:15.026]  We'll go over that.
[00:38:16.647 --> 00:38:23.071]  Also, just an example of environmental laws meant to bring in neo-feudalism and serve to control populations.
[00:38:23.671 --> 00:38:27.573]  Prison threat for pensioner, that's a retiree who puts sand back on beach.
[00:38:28.054 --> 00:38:30.255]  He lives on the beach, his garden got covered up with sand.
[00:38:30.615 --> 00:38:31.916]  He shovels it back out on the beach.
[00:38:32.654 --> 00:38:34.595]  That is not natural.
[00:38:34.615 --> 00:38:35.776]  That's an attack on the earth.
[00:38:36.337 --> 00:38:37.277]  He's not allowed to do that.
[00:38:37.377 --> 00:38:39.459]  So see, it's now shoveling sand is evil.
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.361]  And he faces, what is it?
[00:38:44.282 --> 00:38:44.782]  I forget.
[00:38:44.842 --> 00:38:52.267]  It's like a 50,000 pound fine or around $100,000 fine and six months in jail.
[00:38:52.287 --> 00:38:54.829]  I want to get him on.
[00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.912]  We're working on some of these scientists too, exposing global warming as a hoax.
[00:39:00.307 --> 00:39:07.330]  Brazil, the police battled Bush protesters, and just a bunch of other news here in front of me.
[00:39:09.091 --> 00:39:11.292]  France banned citizen journalists from reporting.
[00:39:11.312 --> 00:39:16.094]  The Council on Foreign Relations puts out a report calling it the New World Order.
[00:39:17.134 --> 00:39:18.074]  It's all coming up.
[00:39:18.955 --> 00:39:23.577]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[00:39:25.237 --> 00:39:26.458]  Let's talk to David.
[00:39:27.486 --> 00:39:29.386]  And David, I'm told you disagree with us.
[00:39:29.406 --> 00:39:30.447]  Where are you calling from today?
[00:39:30.947 --> 00:39:32.767]  Hi Alex, I'm calling from Michigan, Detroit.
[00:39:33.067 --> 00:39:33.848]  Yes, what's on your mind?
[00:39:35.288 --> 00:39:44.510]  I agree with you about most everything, but yesterday you went on a mini tirade against James Cameron and I wanted to correct you on fact and disagree with you strongly in spirit about what you said about him.
[00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:48.251]  Well, first off, I run a blog for James Cameron.
[00:39:48.351 --> 00:39:51.112]  I mean, not for him, but jamescameron.blogspot.com.
[00:39:51.152 --> 00:39:52.032]  It's just a fan blog.
[00:39:53.372 --> 00:39:54.473]  Just two quick corrections.
[00:39:54.513 --> 00:39:56.293]  First off, you said that he's been working
[00:39:56.963 --> 00:39:58.687]  Um, on nothing but developing holograms.
[00:39:59.088 --> 00:40:01.473]  Um, but you're vastly mistaken.
[00:40:01.554 --> 00:40:03.057]  He's been doing a lot for the past 10 years.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.282]  Yeah, and he's patented many cameras.
[00:40:06.322 --> 00:40:09.164]  Him and his brother Mike are both incredible engineers and inventors.
[00:40:09.224 --> 00:40:13.987]  Sir, look, I know people that have been in the back side of his research labs.
[00:40:14.728 --> 00:40:26.115]  Of course it's a generalization to say, I've said actually he's made a few TV shows and a few films, but he's basically been totally focused on a whole new format for movies.
[00:40:26.175 --> 00:40:26.936]  Is that not the case?
[00:40:27.356 --> 00:40:31.638]  Alex, no, he, yes, him and Vincent Pace directed and created what's called a Fusion Camera.
[00:40:31.658 --> 00:40:33.298]  It's just basically a new stereo vision camera.
[00:40:33.659 --> 00:40:35.439]  But he's also been on NASA's Board of Directors.
[00:40:35.459 --> 00:40:37.120]  He's directed five documentaries.
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:44.903]  He's been, uh, you know, he's, I don't know what he does, basically designed a spacecraft to get manned to Mars, you know, on NASA's Board of Advisors.
[00:40:45.403 --> 00:40:46.464]  He's an incredible guy.
[00:40:46.504 --> 00:40:48.945]  And second off, I wanted, this is what I said, I wanted to disagree with you in spirit.
[00:40:49.145 --> 00:40:51.566]  And he's now got this Jesus hoax thing.
[00:40:52.233 --> 00:40:54.214]  He's just executive producing this.
[00:40:54.254 --> 00:41:06.062]  He's worked with this guy, and yeah, the director of that is a little bit... Oh, it's the classic Merovingian slash Knights Templar stuff about Jesus married Mary Magdalene and all that baloney.
[00:41:06.082 --> 00:41:07.423]  Well, I didn't see it, and I can't speak to that.
[00:41:07.443 --> 00:41:12.226]  How many years have we said they'll have archaeological finds to try to discredit Christianity?
[00:41:12.266 --> 00:41:13.167]  That's all this is.
[00:41:13.567 --> 00:41:19.611]  Well, you know, let me tell you, I trust James Cameron almost explicitly, but I also want to say, like, if you're going after him... Do you know James Cameron?
[00:41:20.152 --> 00:41:21.733]  No, of course not, but I'm in Detroit here.
[00:41:22.472 --> 00:41:24.715]  But no, I'm a huge fan of him.
[00:41:25.196 --> 00:41:28.400]  Actually, I wanted to get into why he's not at all a New World Order shrill.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:38.393]  And actually, incidentally, I call on your show every couple of weeks and I was actually going to mention him as a possible 9-11 truther because I know he likes studying archaeological expeditions like the Titanic and the Bismarck.
[00:41:38.852 --> 00:41:42.355]  And I know that he's partnered up with this guy, Charles Pellegrino, to study Ground Zero.
[00:41:42.755 --> 00:41:45.457]  And I mean, he's totally dead.
[00:41:45.477 --> 00:41:46.678]  Wait a minute, excuse me.
[00:41:46.698 --> 00:41:48.820]  He's partnered up with who to study Ground Zero?
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:50.681]  Charles Pellegrino?
[00:41:50.781 --> 00:41:55.565]  I don't know who this guy is, but he's an archaeologist of some sort, and he studies artifacts.
[00:41:55.805 --> 00:41:56.646]  Charles Pellegrino is.
[00:41:57.306 --> 00:42:02.372]  I mean, as he said, he's investigating alternative collapse theories.
[00:42:02.752 --> 00:42:15.105]  James Cameron, he just mentioned in an interview I recently read that he studied Ground Zero, and I know the sort of guy he is, the way that he studied the Titanic, long after he made the movie, I know that he wouldn't lie about it.
[00:42:15.125 --> 00:42:18.589]  He's not going to give away his honesty to the government, so he would definitely
[00:42:19.571 --> 00:42:22.854]  I mean, if he sees Building 7... Well, look, this is really a distraction.
[00:42:23.075 --> 00:42:26.077]  I mean, we'll see if he comes out and does that.
[00:42:26.097 --> 00:42:29.120]  I see no evidence... Well, let me just say something, and then you can.
[00:42:31.283 --> 00:42:39.190]  Sir, when South Park came out and did that obvious hit piece on 9-11 Truth,
[00:42:40.439 --> 00:42:44.541]  We said this is an attack on 9-11 Truth, and a bunch of 9-11 Truthers got mad at us.
[00:42:45.001 --> 00:42:52.005]  I'd say about 40% of them said we were evil, that South Park was good, that this was helping 9-11 Truth.
[00:42:52.605 --> 00:43:01.589]  Well, they've since given an interview, and we posted it up on Jones Report two days ago, where they said they hate us, we're a bunch of idiots, this was meant to discredit 9-11 Truth.
[00:43:01.629 --> 00:43:03.090]  Now that's out of their mouths.
[00:43:04.053 --> 00:43:29.001]  And I understand people pick different groups their fans of different Hollywood and TV producers they like but I mean just come on man James Cameron is working on a lot of new technologies for film I'm not saying that's bad I was saying that's what the next wave is and then he's dedicated a lot of his time and energy to it and I did make a snide remark about his big hike
[00:43:30.902 --> 00:43:39.191]  Jesus Discovery, which he just basically saw what happened with the Passion of the Christ, and he's trying to create a big controversy and make another billion bucks.
[00:43:39.231 --> 00:43:41.874]  It's pretty obvious what he's doing, and fine, he can do that.
[00:43:42.154 --> 00:43:48.501]  Now, we can agree to disagree about James Cameron, and he may be a great guy, he may go public on 9-11 Truth, and I'll say I was wrong.
[00:43:49.442 --> 00:43:50.924]  But, now go ahead and make your other point.
[00:43:51.570 --> 00:44:00.519]  Well, I just want to say, like, you're... I mean, the context in which you said that yesterday, you were kind of insinuating that he's basically just, um, you know, kind of a New World Order shrill, and I want to say that's the opposite.
[00:44:00.579 --> 00:44:05.043]  If you look at his movies and read what he's written about them, uh, he is just the exact opposite.
[00:44:05.063 --> 00:44:10.468]  If you notice, um, first off, there's a very strong, unmistakable anti-abortion subtext in his movies.
[00:44:10.809 --> 00:44:14.232]  Actually, it's explicitly stated in the first Terminator, Terminator is a mechanized abortionist.
[00:44:14.779 --> 00:44:19.281]  And in the abyss, in the climax, the hero, it's all a metaphor for childbirth.
[00:44:19.381 --> 00:44:26.424]  I don't know if you ever saw them, but when Bud is breathing liquid, it's kind of hard to explain.
[00:44:26.624 --> 00:44:34.307]  Sir, they actually have deep diving systems where you do inhale the oxygen-laden liquid.
[00:44:34.627 --> 00:44:36.147]  That's just a birth thing.
[00:44:37.921 --> 00:44:46.465]  No, but if you look at all his other movies, if you remember Terminator 2... I understand, sir, but they're trying to start World War III with Iran right now, and a lot of other things are happening.
[00:44:46.745 --> 00:44:48.246]  I understand you love James Cameron.
[00:44:48.306 --> 00:44:49.566]  I appreciate your call, okay?
[00:44:50.827 --> 00:44:52.288]  I really do appreciate it.
[00:44:53.148 --> 00:44:55.329]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[00:44:55.369 --> 00:44:56.710]  Let's talk to Lucas in Texas.
[00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:57.490]  Lucas, go ahead.
[00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:58.571]  Hey, what's up, man?
[00:44:58.611 --> 00:44:59.331]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:44:59.966 --> 00:45:00.546]  Good to talk to you.
[00:45:00.566 --> 00:45:01.007]  What's on your mind?
[00:45:01.027 --> 00:45:04.008]  The last caller needs to cut down on the coffee before he comes on the radio.
[00:45:04.028 --> 00:45:04.608]  Well, that's okay.
[00:45:04.628 --> 00:45:06.069]  It's good to have energy.
[00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:10.811]  Hey, I found that clip I had mentioned yesterday about Building No.
[00:45:10.831 --> 00:45:10.811]  7.
[00:45:10.911 --> 00:45:16.494]  Yeah, you called and said there was a Fox News clip where you believed from seeing it, but you'd forgotten where it was out on the way.
[00:45:16.594 --> 00:45:17.115]  Right, right.
[00:45:17.215 --> 00:45:21.117]  Basically, what it says is not on the ticker, but it's the little splash screen above it.
[00:45:21.157 --> 00:45:22.897]  It says, Building No.
[00:45:22.917 --> 00:45:26.199]  7 was 47 stories tall, and then it says, Building No.
[00:45:26.539 --> 00:45:27.980]  7 had already been evacuated.
[00:45:28.573 --> 00:45:30.814]  Now, so that's insinuating that it had already fallen.
[00:45:30.834 --> 00:45:34.715]  Now, what I need help on is finding the time stamp for this, because that's not what I'm skilled at.
[00:45:34.735 --> 00:45:36.256]  I'm skilled at making this documentary.
[00:45:36.936 --> 00:45:41.357]  What I've done is I've taken that clip and I've put it in a trailer for my documentary.
[00:45:41.737 --> 00:45:46.559]  If you want to see it, it's at 8 minutes and 36 seconds into the trailer.
[00:45:47.139 --> 00:45:49.200]  The trailer is called The Ultimate Con.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:55.662]  You can see it by going to my YouTube channel, which is youtube.com forward slash reality network.
[00:45:56.668 --> 00:45:58.148]  Go there, you know, while you're there.
[00:45:58.168 --> 00:46:04.430]  Sure, we'll check it out, but for those that just joined us, I don't want to have a private discussion that people don't understand.
[00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:12.432]  You're talking about two weeks ago it broke, that BBC had reported that Building 7 had collapsed 20 plus minutes before it did.
[00:46:12.832 --> 00:46:17.193]  Then we got the CNN clip an hour and seven minutes before with Aaron Brown saying the same thing.
[00:46:18.333 --> 00:46:21.554]  You had said that you'd come across a Fox clip where
[00:46:22.262 --> 00:46:23.624]  I mean, that's an important clip.
[00:46:24.145 --> 00:46:31.976]  We can find the time stamp, and it's pre-collapse, but it's not as expressly stated as the other clips.
[00:46:32.637 --> 00:46:32.917]  Right.
[00:46:33.298 --> 00:46:33.418]  Right.
[00:46:33.458 --> 00:46:35.801]  It's just one more piece to add to the, you know, to add to the list.
[00:46:35.821 --> 00:46:36.021]  It is.
[00:46:36.081 --> 00:46:37.223]  No, it's very important.
[00:46:37.624 --> 00:46:38.365]  I'll go check it out.
[00:46:38.405 --> 00:46:39.146]  What else is on your mind?
[00:46:39.508 --> 00:46:41.890]  Well, if everybody could help, I put this trailer out there.
[00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:43.652]  It's already starting to get pretty good traffic.
[00:46:43.752 --> 00:46:49.277]  If everybody could help me to get that to the top on YouTube, I guess I'd just go and type in The Ultimate Con.
[00:46:49.317 --> 00:46:52.219]  It'll be first to pop up on the list, or check out my YouTube channel.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.300]  We'll do that, my friend.
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:53.781]  Anything else?
[00:46:54.922 --> 00:46:55.683]  Just watch it twice.
[00:46:55.743 --> 00:46:57.064]  Hit refresh so it gets more hits.
[00:46:57.124 --> 00:46:58.365]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[00:46:58.445 --> 00:46:59.106]  I appreciate it.
[00:47:00.087 --> 00:47:02.088]  Let's talk to Aaron in Vegas.
[00:47:02.128 --> 00:47:02.449]  Go ahead.
[00:47:02.469 --> 00:47:02.989]  You're on the air.
[00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:04.150]  Hey, Alex.
[00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:04.611]  How's it going?
[00:47:04.711 --> 00:47:05.031]  Good, sir.
[00:47:06.235 --> 00:47:11.378]  Um, first thing, yesterday, I'm not sure who it was who called in yesterday, but I think the guy was insinuating he was threatening you.
[00:47:11.398 --> 00:47:31.331]  The dude wanted to murder you, I'm not sure he said... He said... Okay, let's be clear, his name is Troy, and he did call in a few months ago, and he said, Troy from West Virginia, he said, uh, you know, I might, uh, physically assault you, beat you up, but you'll run to the cops if I see you at another Ground Zero in New York.
[00:47:31.951 --> 00:47:34.933]  Then he called in when John Connor was filling in for Jack Blood a few weeks ago,
[00:47:36.287 --> 00:47:42.308]  And he said, I'd like you to call me a zombie when you're walking around the street, you know, cause I'll punch you in the face.
[00:47:42.908 --> 00:47:45.369]  So when he called in here, I said, are you going to threaten me again?
[00:47:45.389 --> 00:47:47.349]  Are you going to threaten us again?
[00:47:47.389 --> 00:47:47.929]  That's wrong.
[00:47:47.969 --> 00:47:48.509]  You're doing it.
[00:47:48.949 --> 00:47:55.570]  He said, I never threatened you, but I'll, but, but, but, you know, it's only 180 days till 9 11, you know, in New York.
[00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:59.851]  So he just basically showed how does, how dumb does he think we are?
[00:47:59.891 --> 00:48:00.311]  But go ahead.
[00:48:01.491 --> 00:48:03.652]  Uh, the number though, he used the number one 87.
[00:48:03.752 --> 00:48:05.852]  I think that's a police code for murder.
[00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:09.459]  It's exactly 187 days, but that's besides the point.
[00:48:09.519 --> 00:48:15.804]  I wanted to call in and talk to you about... I was wondering if you think that there's any legitimate concerns about population growth in the world?
[00:48:18.907 --> 00:48:21.008]  Well, number one, I want to go back to what you first just said.
[00:48:21.028 --> 00:48:23.951]  I was eating a sandwich while you were talking and it just bit my lip.
[00:48:23.991 --> 00:48:24.371]  Excuse me.
[00:48:25.011 --> 00:48:27.253]  I have to eat on the fly here, folks.
[00:48:27.573 --> 00:48:33.118]  I didn't eat breakfast, and I get low blood sugar, and my brain isn't working good, so I have to try to eat.
[00:48:33.678 --> 00:48:34.479]  Don't try to ignore you.
[00:48:35.251 --> 00:48:35.771]  Go back to the 187.
[00:48:35.871 --> 00:48:42.974]  It wouldn't... Was yesterday not 187 days till the sixth anniversary?
[00:48:43.634 --> 00:48:44.175]  Yes, it is.
[00:48:44.335 --> 00:48:47.436]  And then I think that he was insinuating that it's 187 days.
[00:48:48.476 --> 00:48:50.617]  That's the police code for murder, I believe.
[00:48:50.957 --> 00:48:52.838]  Well, a lot of folks think... Yeah, we got a 187.
[00:48:53.658 --> 00:48:54.419]  They think that...
[00:48:56.212 --> 00:48:57.733]  I mean, it was all meant to be menacing.
[00:48:58.193 --> 00:48:59.493]  I'll see you, bye bye.
[00:48:59.513 --> 00:49:00.654]  Well, of course.
[00:49:00.734 --> 00:49:01.874]  I'll be seeing you, okay.
[00:49:02.474 --> 00:49:02.975]  Alright.
[00:49:03.315 --> 00:49:05.356]  It just shows how far gone the country is.
[00:49:06.516 --> 00:49:11.238]  But getting up to your next point, are there legitimate concerns about population?
[00:49:11.338 --> 00:49:11.618]  Okay.
[00:49:13.439 --> 00:49:24.743]  There are six and a half billion people, every major organization, even the UN, that have studied population growth trends believe it will peak out at about eight and a half to ten billion max.
[00:49:25.686 --> 00:49:27.127]  The Earth can sustain that.
[00:49:28.127 --> 00:49:33.569]  And are you going to set a government up that is going to have the power to decide who has children, who lives, who dies?
[00:49:33.629 --> 00:49:38.131]  It's the ultimate excuse for the globalist, for a neo-feudalist state.
[00:49:38.651 --> 00:49:46.574]  And if you look at Japan, with a huge negative population growth curve, Western Europe, Russia is literally dying.
[00:49:47.014 --> 00:49:50.275]  The fastest degradation are not having children.
[00:49:51.002 --> 00:50:02.327]  The United States only has a 3% population growth, and that's with a nearly 8% growth in immigrants every year, so we're actually dying as well.
[00:50:03.688 --> 00:50:11.392]  And so, once a country industrializes, you see, within a generation, a decrease in the births, naturally.
[00:50:12.552 --> 00:50:19.235]  So, no, I don't see a problem, and I would never see any solution by government to quote population.
[00:50:19.255 --> 00:50:20.196]  Do you have a comment to that?
[00:50:21.084 --> 00:50:27.145]  I was just wondering, so do you think they're hyping it kind of just like global warming to get us to accept that police state that we're entering into?
[00:50:28.366 --> 00:50:36.407]  Well, it's as Dr. Bianca, University of Texas professor said, we need a Chinese-style police state to enforce population reduction.
[00:50:38.388 --> 00:50:40.548]  I mean, it's the ultimate form of dehumanization.
[00:50:40.568 --> 00:50:44.669]  Oh, humans are bad, we're causing a problem, so big deal if we kill a bunch of them or control them.
[00:50:45.049 --> 00:50:48.290]  Because we're the big masters and we know what's best and we're the elite.
[00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:49.970]  Do you want to add more to this?
[00:50:51.164 --> 00:50:51.764]  Oh, no, that's it.
[00:50:51.804 --> 00:50:52.604]  Thanks for talking to me, Al.
[00:50:52.804 --> 00:50:53.465]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[00:50:53.505 --> 00:50:54.085]  I appreciate your call.
[00:50:54.105 --> 00:50:54.665]  It's a good question.
[00:50:54.685 --> 00:50:55.225]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:57.886 --> 00:51:04.628]  It's here.
[00:51:04.788 --> 00:51:09.569]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:09.929 --> 00:51:17.551]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.266 --> 00:51:25.330]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:37.136]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.456 --> 00:51:40.958]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.418 --> 00:51:43.339]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.679 --> 00:51:47.521]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:59.363]  HerbalHealer.com Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:54:03.205 --> 00:54:05.647]  Come, you masters of war.
[00:54:08.252 --> 00:54:10.134]  It'll build the big guns.
[00:54:12.596 --> 00:54:14.918]  It'll build the death planes.
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.782]  It'll build all the bombs.
[00:54:21.304 --> 00:54:23.666]  It'll hide behind walls.
[00:54:25.628 --> 00:54:27.429]  It'll hide behind desks.
[00:54:34.139 --> 00:54:38.161]  You know that guy that called in yesterday threatening me again with bail threats?
[00:54:38.922 --> 00:54:40.803]  We've got him on record with his public threats.
[00:54:41.644 --> 00:54:45.086]  He did keep saying 187, 187, 187 real cryptically.
[00:54:45.766 --> 00:54:50.970]  And Kevin just walked in here with the police-central.com.
[00:54:52.871 --> 00:54:59.035]  I know Pastor Butch did a traceroute on one of his emails and supposedly got his real name and where he's really at.
[00:54:59.824 --> 00:55:02.407]  But yeah, police-central.com.
[00:55:02.547 --> 00:55:04.068]  Yeah, I got a 187 homicide.
[00:55:04.088 --> 00:55:09.593]  I wonder if he's smart enough to do cryptic things like that, though he sounds like some kind of spook.
[00:55:10.634 --> 00:55:13.537]  Because those guys that can do this to the country, a lot of them aren't that smart.
[00:55:14.938 --> 00:55:15.699]  Is that what you meant?
[00:55:15.739 --> 00:55:21.044]  Is it like the other threats about how you'd physically assault me or physically assault John Connor?
[00:55:21.144 --> 00:55:22.125]  Are you now threatening 187s?
[00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.990]  Or was it 187?
[00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:27.911]  Let me see.
[00:55:28.491 --> 00:55:32.132]  How many days are there until September 11th?
[00:55:32.172 --> 00:55:35.593]  Or has he been waiting for that day to call in with that?
[00:55:35.613 --> 00:55:39.474]  It's just amazing that people act and behave like that.
[00:55:41.755 --> 00:55:44.056]  But I go back to what Troy said a few weeks ago.
[00:55:44.236 --> 00:55:45.056]  Maybe it was a month ago.
[00:55:45.096 --> 00:55:45.636]  He called in.
[00:55:45.656 --> 00:55:50.258]  By the way, folks, grab these and put them up on YouTube so you can just type Troy
[00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:52.910]  from West Virginia into YouTube and it pops up.
[00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:54.811]  Every time he talks, they put a donkey on the screen.
[00:55:54.831 --> 00:55:55.451]  It's real funny.
[00:55:56.131 --> 00:55:58.272]  And then when I talk, they put a picture of myself up.
[00:56:00.372 --> 00:56:01.993]  And you can hear him.
[00:56:02.993 --> 00:56:07.714]  And I go, so Newt Gingrich has announced, it was in the Associated Press, that we should restrict the First Amendment and ban a bunch of websites.
[00:56:08.274 --> 00:56:09.434]  And he said, no, that's not true.
[00:56:09.454 --> 00:56:10.174]  You know, you're a liar.
[00:56:10.214 --> 00:56:10.655]  It's not true.
[00:56:10.675 --> 00:56:13.155]  And I said, OK, well, you're saying he's not saying that?
[00:56:13.175 --> 00:56:16.996]  He says, yeah, I'm not saying it, but you should be banned from what you're saying and arrested.
[00:56:19.443 --> 00:56:20.904]  And I said, so you're not for the First Amendment?
[00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:22.185]  And he goes, no, I'm for it.
[00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:23.747]  Double think!
[00:56:24.487 --> 00:56:29.571]  Newt Gingrich isn't saying it, but I'm for it, and it's good what Newt Gingrich is saying.
[00:56:29.631 --> 00:56:35.216]  I mean, it just shows a complete and total disconnect from reality.
[00:56:37.538 --> 00:56:38.479]  And that's what they do!
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:41.321]  That's how they operate.
[00:56:42.102 --> 00:56:43.563]  That's how they get their paychecks.
[00:56:45.424 --> 00:56:46.065]  And it's just...
[00:56:47.387 --> 00:56:50.730]  It's actually saddening, and I try to laugh about it, but it's not funny.
[00:56:52.211 --> 00:56:56.094]  The last caller brought up population reduction.
[00:56:56.815 --> 00:57:07.203]  We have the 1973 CIA Henry Kissinger documents declassified in 92, ordering the third world to sterilize half their women or not get IMF World Bank funding.
[00:57:08.001 --> 00:57:09.542]  We're now doing even more research for this film.
[00:57:09.562 --> 00:57:10.523]  I'm learning stuff every day.
[00:57:10.563 --> 00:57:11.903]  It's far worse than I even thought.
[00:57:12.444 --> 00:57:17.727]  We have the Club of Rome openly talking about reducing the world population by half to 80% and how to do it.
[00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:21.909]  We have the Australians caught lacing grain shipments to Asia with sterilization compounds.
[00:57:22.850 --> 00:57:27.733]  We have vaccines caught red-handed in Africa and Asia filled with sterilization compounds.
[00:57:27.753 --> 00:57:30.614]  There's so much evidence.
[00:57:30.654 --> 00:57:31.895]  I mean, it's on record.
[00:57:33.856 --> 00:57:34.797]  It is on record.
[00:57:37.347 --> 00:57:40.749]  And a caller calls in and says, you know, are you worried about population?
[00:57:40.769 --> 00:57:47.972]  I mean, obviously, six and a half billion people are tearing up a lot of stuff, and humans do some good things for the Earth, but do a lot of bad things, too.
[00:57:48.012 --> 00:57:57.876]  But don't ever think that the people in charge care about the Earth, and, you know, any of this, oh, let's reduce population, or have a police state to control the population to save Earth, that's just their ultimate excuse.
[00:58:00.997 --> 00:58:06.400]  Just goes back to human sacrifice, where we gotta sacrifice some of the tribe so the gods will make it rain.
[00:58:08.058 --> 00:58:16.228]  And really it was just an exercise of power by the king class and of course the priest class.
[00:58:16.949 --> 00:58:18.430]  The nobility and the priest class.
[00:58:19.632 --> 00:58:23.196]  Just sociology, basic anthropology with a sociological view.
[00:58:25.359 --> 00:58:26.961]  Alright, Chris, John,
[00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:28.630]  Many others.
[00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:29.891]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:58:30.531 --> 00:58:36.913]  And then at the end, after we've got Paul Watson popping in, I'm going to get into this whole Global Warming documentary that's just excellent and a lot more.
[00:58:36.953 --> 00:58:38.174]  It's a big Friday edition.
[00:58:38.194 --> 00:58:39.994]  Stay with us.
[00:58:40.755 --> 00:58:45.596]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:45.616 --> 00:58:45.736]  Hello!
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:57.720]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.381 --> 00:58:59.421]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.142 --> 00:59:01.282]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.922 --> 00:59:02.723]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.483 --> 00:59:04.384]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.044 --> 00:59:08.706]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.226 --> 00:59:13.328]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:30.014 --> 00:59:39.160]  Now into our number two, Paul Watson popping in to talk about an amazing film that aired in England yesterday on Channel 4 exposing global warming.
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:44.344]  As a host, we're going to play some clips from the documentary to analyze them and talk to Paul and then get back into your calls.
[00:59:44.384 --> 00:59:45.825]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[00:59:46.425 --> 00:59:47.846]  Let's talk to Chris in Florida.
[00:59:47.886 --> 00:59:48.547]  Go ahead, Chris.
[00:59:49.788 --> 00:59:52.630]  It sure is sneaky, but I have to wish him
[00:59:53.376 --> 00:59:57.198]  Same that I would wish for you or anybody, and that would be lasting health and happiness.
[00:59:57.779 --> 00:59:59.800]  Yeah, live long and live long and prosper.
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.001]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:00:03.062 --> 01:00:19.692]  Troy does, he uses different names to call him, as you know, at the different GCN talk shows, and he calls him to condemn the host, but he doesn't talk about the facts, and he's not ashamed of the fact that we can't be sure of his real name because he doesn't take pride in his real name.
[01:00:20.453 --> 01:00:24.774]  So in my opinion, folks like that, no pride equals no shame.
[01:00:25.835 --> 01:00:36.118]  And for lack of a better name, he uses the time between, the space actually, between you and him in West Virginia and Texas.
[01:00:36.818 --> 01:00:45.281]  That's his lame excuse for giving you the time between now and the next 9-11 anniversary before he would confront you in person.
[01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:50.732]  So if he were really against you, he wouldn't give you all that time to make more history.
[01:00:50.752 --> 01:00:58.195]  And for people like that who seem so invincibly ignorant, you shouldn't really have any pity.
[01:00:58.215 --> 01:01:03.537]  Because that's really the kind of attention that helps him feel disempowered.
[01:01:04.137 --> 01:01:08.879]  You just need to pray for him to wake up and feel our Creator's love.
[01:01:09.477 --> 01:01:14.321]  Well, I mean, the big thing here is he denies the North American Union, others like him do.
[01:01:14.781 --> 01:01:18.504]  They'll deny there's any spying going on, or that it's illegal.
[01:01:18.524 --> 01:01:31.395]  I mean, the NSA, for ten years, has been listening, has been wired into everything, and then the President gets up and lies about it, and then people like him will just say, no, it's not true, our leader only tells the truth, he's only good.
[01:01:31.795 --> 01:01:34.818]  I mean, how is that an American attribute?
[01:01:34.878 --> 01:01:36.059]  How did we turn into this?
[01:01:37.276 --> 01:01:50.002]  Right, well, he says just in the talk show host repeat that he told Congress what was going on, and yet you have Bob Graham, for example, saying, well, we were told that he had this program, but it was a different bill of goods.
[01:01:50.022 --> 01:01:52.404]  He didn't know that he was bypassing FISA.
[01:01:53.044 --> 01:02:06.891]  So, you know, these talk show hosts, I've called up one and confronted him about that, and then they're totally aware of that fact, that Bob Graham came out and he said he didn't know that we were being sold a used car, and we were told it was a new car, basically.
[01:02:08.326 --> 01:02:18.451]  And last week I asked Neil Bortz how CNN and the BBC would know to announce that World Trade Center Building 7 would collapse before it happened.
[01:02:19.091 --> 01:02:24.153]  So he naturally asked me if I was an Alex Jones fanatic, to which I answered, I asked you first.
[01:02:24.993 --> 01:02:32.716]  And then Neil said, of course, Alex Jones fanatics and doubters of the 9-11 official story should be locked up in concentration camps.
[01:02:33.617 --> 01:02:36.358]  And have you, Alex... He actually said that?
[01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:39.587]  Oh yes, and have you meet us in a daily prayer vigil.
[01:02:40.047 --> 01:02:42.987]  Have our driver's license and voter ID revoked.
[01:02:43.108 --> 01:02:44.188]  Oh yeah, of course.
[01:02:44.268 --> 01:02:46.548]  I just wanted to let you know to add him to your list.
[01:02:46.568 --> 01:02:51.349]  Well I'd like somebody to give me that clip, but I mean this, I mean I know everybody else is saying that.
[01:02:51.390 --> 01:03:00.032]  I mean they're openly now saying we want to arrest you, we want to put you in camps, we want to kill you, we want to get you, and that's because they know we're winning.
[01:03:00.092 --> 01:03:01.572]  Hey listen, we're not going to stop.
[01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:07.651]  And it's going to come out, and all these talk show hosts, it's going to turn out, who are on the government payroll, are going to be going to prison.
[01:03:08.993 --> 01:03:20.385]  Well, you've given the pep talk at the White House, just like all those other talk show hosts, but anytime I ask Neil about his silly explanations of 9-11, he answers by asking if I'm an Alex Jones nut job.
[01:03:20.445 --> 01:03:23.469]  So, I want to tell the folks to keep on calling Neil.
[01:03:24.088 --> 01:03:26.328]  He will take your call and allow you to discredit him.
[01:03:26.348 --> 01:03:30.429]  It's easy to get through, which is really a reflection of how poor his ratings are.
[01:03:30.629 --> 01:03:34.890]  So he actually said we should be put in concentration camps?
[01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:37.531]  Yes, and have you meet us in a daily prayer vigil.
[01:03:38.211 --> 01:03:40.471]  Yes, I'd record that if you'd like.
[01:03:41.171 --> 01:03:44.052]  You know, I wonder if he'll be happy when that actually happens.
[01:03:44.072 --> 01:03:46.032]  Of course, they'll be taking his pension fund as well.
[01:03:47.692 --> 01:03:48.273]  He won't care.
[01:03:48.313 --> 01:03:48.813]  He'll love it.
[01:03:49.073 --> 01:03:49.793]  They love it, man.
[01:03:49.833 --> 01:03:50.673]  They love evil.
[01:03:56.087 --> 01:04:01.537]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:09.531]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.262 --> 01:04:17.325]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.705 --> 01:04:29.150]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:33.372]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.392 --> 01:04:35.353]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.673 --> 01:04:39.455]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.004 --> 01:04:58.227]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:04:58.367 --> 01:05:06.452]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:05:06.712 --> 01:05:13.756]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:05:14.717 --> 01:05:21.202]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:05:21.402 --> 01:05:26.486]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:05:26.606 --> 01:05:35.474]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:05:35.734 --> 01:05:39.036]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:05:53.934 --> 01:05:56.516]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:56.656 --> 01:05:58.818]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:05:59.098 --> 01:06:09.207]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:11.829]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[01:06:57.443 --> 01:06:58.103]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.764 --> 01:06:59.824]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.524 --> 01:07:01.644]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.304 --> 01:07:03.104]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.864 --> 01:07:04.705]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.425 --> 01:07:09.245]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.605 --> 01:07:13.706]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:24.529 --> 01:07:27.396]  Yeah, I think.
[01:07:31.878 --> 01:07:38.880]  Paul Watson wrote a great article titled Powerful Documentary Trounces Man-Made Warming Hoax.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:43.761]  Climate change is natural and has been happening since the earth began.
[01:07:43.941 --> 01:07:55.784]  An astounding documentary that was broadcast in the UK last night completely trounced the man-made explanation for global warming not with emotionally laden propaganda or by attacking the messenger
[01:07:56.631 --> 01:08:02.374]  As its adherents resort to, but by presenting carefully considered and rational science.
[01:08:02.434 --> 01:08:04.615]  And I've watched three clips of it.
[01:08:05.056 --> 01:08:06.016]  We're going to be playing those.
[01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:09.398]  Paul Watson has seen the entire piece.
[01:08:10.951 --> 01:08:13.774]  His phone line is having trouble right now over in the UK.
[01:08:14.335 --> 01:08:31.012]  The great global warming swindle brought together a plethora of scientists, professors, climatologists, and weather experts to expose the myths about climate change that have been promulgated in order to hoodwink the world into accepting the man-made theory of global warming.
[01:08:34.497 --> 01:08:38.838]  Again, Al Gore uses these ice core samples, but the ice core samples show the opposite.
[01:08:38.878 --> 01:08:40.558]  And I've read the actual studies.
[01:08:41.478 --> 01:08:46.039]  In fact, the studies the UN cites say the opposite of what the UN says on their face.
[01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:49.480]  But they know the general public won't check into that.
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:53.901]  It's being pushed for a global carbon tax.
[01:08:54.381 --> 01:09:01.222]  That's why you see everything from Sports Illustrated, to CNN, to movies, to the Weather Channel,
[01:09:02.029 --> 01:09:05.470]  Just unbelievable propaganda.
[01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:16.394]  And we got the FOIA request in January from the SPP, Security and Prosperity Partnership, North American Union, NAU meeting last September.
[01:09:16.434 --> 01:09:20.175]  And the first agenda was keeping North American Union secret in its expansion.
[01:09:20.215 --> 01:09:20.875]  We're already in it.
[01:09:21.235 --> 01:09:26.137]  And the second agenda was getting a North American carbon tax in with the EU.
[01:09:27.122 --> 01:09:29.123]  With Bush administration officials, they're going along with it.
[01:09:29.383 --> 01:09:36.526]  See, they say publicly they're against Kyoto, but they're not against incrementally bringing us into the carbon tax via a regional system.
[01:09:38.227 --> 01:09:48.472]  They just don't want the taxes, the dominant portion, to go to the United Nations, so there is some infighting, and that's one of the things the Founding Fathers said was so beautiful about corrupt governments.
[01:09:48.592 --> 01:09:55.435]  The only good thing is that they fight with each other, and that usually keeps them from getting real tyranny, hardcore tyranny, going.
[01:09:56.866 --> 01:10:11.771]  But when that man on the white horse like Napoleon or Hitler does get the power, Katie bar the door because then it goes from just good old boy corruption and a lot of bad things happening to giant sports stadiums and FEMA camps, people filling sports stadiums.
[01:10:12.851 --> 01:10:13.771]  And that's what's scary.
[01:10:13.871 --> 01:10:21.734]  I've heard Neil Bortz, going back here and we'll play these clips, big national talk show host, he's on several stations that I'm on.
[01:10:23.857 --> 01:10:25.599]  I think he's on like four stations I know of.
[01:10:25.639 --> 01:10:27.200]  Four of the affiliates I'm on, he's on.
[01:10:29.462 --> 01:10:33.506]  Including KLBJ 590 that I do a Sunday show syndicated on 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:10:35.969 --> 01:10:38.892]  They offered me weeknights, but I couldn't do it on their syndicated show, folks.
[01:10:39.873 --> 01:10:40.133]  Kidding.
[01:10:41.414 --> 01:10:43.296]  On top of everything else, but I'm already digressing.
[01:10:44.497 --> 01:10:49.340]  And he came to Austin for the second annual TalkFest, and I was part of TalkFest.
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:54.783]  Before I got there, everybody told me, my gosh, Borch just savaged you for like 30 minutes.
[01:10:56.665 --> 01:11:02.428]  And I've heard him on the show say that, oh, it's worse than an S sandwich, it's an Alex Jones sandwich.
[01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:05.170]  And, you know, Alex Jones needs to be locked up.
[01:11:05.230 --> 01:11:10.013]  But now, I know that Wiener, known as Savage, and the rest of the beatnik crowd,
[01:11:11.095 --> 01:11:11.696]  I mean, they're serious too!
[01:11:11.756 --> 01:11:12.957]  I mean, I've heard it!
[01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:14.458]  Anyone who disagrees with the government is a traitor.
[01:11:14.478 --> 01:11:17.061]  Anyone who disagrees with the war is a traitor.
[01:11:29.915 --> 01:11:37.021]  A member of the congressman two weeks ago said anyone who votes in an anti-war resolution in Congress should be arrested and hung.
[01:11:37.441 --> 01:11:38.923]  And the press apologized.
[01:11:38.963 --> 01:11:39.523]  He said, no!
[01:11:39.943 --> 01:11:40.944]  I say kill!
[01:11:41.385 --> 01:11:42.826]  Kill members of Congress!
[01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:49.431]  I mean, they're saying they're elected, they're supposed to go carry out the people's will, they're supposed to carry out the Constitution.
[01:11:49.932 --> 01:11:51.233]  They're supposed to be independent.
[01:11:51.793 --> 01:11:55.977]  But they got about 22% of the public, folks, that will man death camps.
[01:11:57.003 --> 01:11:57.764]  You understand, folks?
[01:11:57.804 --> 01:12:02.007]  They will line us up, and they will shoot us in the back of the head and throw us into dirt pits!
[01:12:02.667 --> 01:12:09.733]  Now, thank God we've got 160 million gun owners, and 400 million guns in new manufacture, and we don't ever want it to come to that.
[01:12:10.613 --> 01:12:16.638]  It's never for attack, only for defense, but once it starts, you know, the best defense is a good offense.
[01:12:17.519 --> 01:12:21.522]  My God, I don't want to come to this, but I'm not going to a FEMA camp, and you shouldn't either!
[01:12:22.182 --> 01:12:24.504]  With these people openly talking about how they want to kill us!
[01:12:25.979 --> 01:12:27.420]  I mean, they're doing it, folks!
[01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:32.124]  And people in Germany went, oh, and they said they want to put us in camps, you know, in 35, 36, 37.
[01:12:33.225 --> 01:12:34.386]  Oh, that's not really going to happen.
[01:12:34.406 --> 01:12:36.488]  Oh, they're arresting some people, but it's not really going to happen.
[01:12:36.508 --> 01:12:37.669]  And then, boom, they get you.
[01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:47.216]  I just feel sorry for the goons they send, because if 1% of us stands up, that is 1.6 million combatants you will lose.
[01:12:47.676 --> 01:12:53.061]  But that's also the plan, is they plan to chew you all up in a fight with us and bring in NATO I-4 forces.
[01:12:53.301 --> 01:12:54.342]  That's Army Times now.
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:59.761]  I live in a Philip K. Dick Twilight Zone episode.
[01:12:59.841 --> 01:13:00.381]  I mean, I do!
[01:13:00.401 --> 01:13:04.142]  Alright, let's bring Paul Watson up just for a few minutes.
[01:13:04.182 --> 01:13:06.263]  He's got a worsening sore throat.
[01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:08.523]  But Paul saw the whole program.
[01:13:08.543 --> 01:13:13.925]  We're going to air like three two-minute clips of it that were found on YouTube and are already uploaded.
[01:13:14.185 --> 01:13:16.685]  I'm told the whole thing's up there now, but I haven't had a chance to see it yet.
[01:13:17.486 --> 01:13:19.306]  Paul, you saw the broadcast last night.
[01:13:19.346 --> 01:13:22.747]  Tell us about it and the research it had in it.
[01:13:24.489 --> 01:13:25.650]  Hello, Alex.
[01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:29.492]  Yeah, it was called The Great Global Warming Swindle.
[01:13:29.952 --> 01:13:36.055]  It was on Channel 4 television, which is broadcast in the UK last night at 9pm.
[01:13:36.075 --> 01:13:37.876]  90-minute documentary.
[01:13:38.876 --> 01:13:46.780]  And, you know, the evidence wasn't presented on the basis of photographs of stranded polar bears on ice caps.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:56.262]  ICPP representatives impersonating chimps, or, you know, shutting off the lights on the Eiffel Tower for five minutes.
[01:13:57.542 --> 01:14:02.723]  Which is how the other side try and get people to believe that global warming is man-made.
[01:14:03.003 --> 01:14:09.344]  Yeah, they're approaching the mindless, bestial nature of a public that can't find major continents on a map.
[01:14:10.325 --> 01:14:17.186]  Right, and to get it straight, the very first comment that my article received, which I predicted, was
[01:14:18.759 --> 01:14:21.441]  Everyone knows that global warming is real.
[01:14:21.581 --> 01:14:23.883]  Anyone who tells us otherwise is a dumb.
[01:14:23.903 --> 01:14:26.624]  And then you can fill in the three-letter word afterwards.
[01:14:26.825 --> 01:14:36.291]  And you predicted three weeks before that they would say that they wanted to ban global warming denial, saying it's like Holocaust denial, and they've now done it.
[01:14:38.012 --> 01:14:40.073]  Well, yeah, they're preparing that.
[01:14:40.113 --> 01:14:42.735]  There was a Boston Globe journalist who came out and said,
[01:14:43.824 --> 01:14:45.504]  There's no time for a debate.
[01:14:45.985 --> 01:14:49.305]  The debates over anyone who disagrees is akin to a holocaust denier.
[01:14:49.525 --> 01:14:50.346]  Let's get back to the film.
[01:14:50.386 --> 01:14:50.866]  I'll shut up.
[01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:51.386]  Tell us about it.
[01:14:52.066 --> 01:15:04.949]  Why I mentioned that comment was this person obviously didn't get as far as reading my headline which is powerful documentary transfers man-made, that's man-made warming hoax.
[01:15:06.009 --> 01:15:11.151]  We don't deny that global warming is happening because it has always happened throughout the Earth.
[01:15:11.171 --> 01:15:12.391]  A million, 4.5 billion
[01:15:13.891 --> 01:15:14.792]  Year history.
[01:15:14.832 --> 01:15:21.297]  We don't deny it's happening, but the evidence clearly suggests that it's a natural occurrence, and it's not man-made.
[01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:27.461]  And regardless, the UN solution of global tax, even if you believe the official story, won't help.
[01:15:28.642 --> 01:15:35.007]  No, it'll only hit us in the pocket, and then people accuse us of being with the corporations.
[01:15:35.934 --> 01:15:48.257]  And with the polluters, if we dare question this religion of global warming... And really they just want socialism, a way to attach more wealth, what they don't know is the big corporations are lobbying for all of this as a way to get control.
[01:15:49.097 --> 01:15:54.398]  Yeah, just like they created peak oil to get artificial scarcity, they can manipulate it on a whim.
[01:15:55.058 --> 01:16:01.780]  But they had scientists, professors, climatologists, weather experts, space experts,
[01:16:02.859 --> 01:16:11.461]  And it was basically a 90-minute rebuttal of the proposition that global warming is caused by CO2 emissions.
[01:16:12.621 --> 01:16:19.383]  One of the other comments on that board was, you know, how can you deny that the Earth got warmer since the Industrial Revolution?
[01:16:20.003 --> 01:16:26.004]  Well, in actual fact, the Earth's temperature from the 1940s until the 1980s, which was when the major wave of
[01:16:31.058 --> 01:16:34.180]  You know, the Industrial Revolution really kicked on after the war.
[01:16:35.461 --> 01:16:37.662]  The Earth's temperature got cooler.
[01:16:38.542 --> 01:16:44.666]  So much so that by the 1970s, there was political and media scaremongering.
[01:16:44.826 --> 01:16:59.235]  It was quite funny how they played a BBC documentary that was made in the mid-70s, which basically said that the new threat was global cooling, and that if we didn't take drastic steps to offset this
[01:17:00.433 --> 01:17:07.359]  Coming Ice Age, then, you know, we were facing a basic meteorological apocalypse, and that was in the mid-70s.
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:24.135]  It was all about global cooling, because the Earth was coming to the end of this cycle of cooling, and then after that, it picked up again after the 80s, because sun activity, sun radiation, sunspot activity increased, which is what they also proved in the program, that
[01:17:24.781 --> 01:17:33.423]  Global temperatures match almost precisely sunspot activity, and they've traced it back hundreds of years.
[01:17:33.443 --> 01:17:48.647]  And they also took on Al Gore, who in his film Inconvenient Truth, and remember Al Gore is not a scientist, and neither am I, so if Al Gore can comment on this subject, then so can anyone else.
[01:17:48.687 --> 01:17:50.867]  He's a politician, he's a professional liar.
[01:17:51.988 --> 01:17:53.688]  He did not invent the internet!
[01:17:55.532 --> 01:18:09.135]  And he takes these Antarctic ice core samples and says that they show that carbon dioxide leads temperature rates.
[01:18:09.215 --> 01:18:12.056]  As carbon dioxide goes up, so do temperature rates.
[01:18:12.676 --> 01:18:15.516]  In actual fact, he reversed the data.
[01:18:16.196 --> 01:18:19.217]  It's the opposite way round and that's shown in the documentary.
[01:18:19.722 --> 01:18:25.847]  The carbon dioxide levels lag behind temperature rise by 800 years.
[01:18:27.288 --> 01:18:31.772]  But it's the temperature rise that causes the carbon dioxide, not the other way around, as Al Gore claims.
[01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:37.076]  Paul Watson, thank you for joining us and giving us that basic thumbnail sketch.
[01:18:37.416 --> 01:18:39.358]  We're going to play some of these clips when we get back.
[01:18:40.038 --> 01:18:41.359]  And get well, my friend.
[01:18:41.399 --> 01:18:42.340]  Continue your hard work.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.301]  We appreciate it.
[01:18:44.923 --> 01:18:45.344]  You bet.
[01:18:45.785 --> 01:18:49.795]  We'll be right back and start playing the first of three clips, then your calls.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.122]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:18:56.463 --> 01:18:59.345]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:18:59.565 --> 01:19:05.770]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:19:06.150 --> 01:19:13.456]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.

[01:19:52.645 --> 01:19:53.625]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:19:53.705 --> 01:19:58.486]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:19:58.646 --> 01:20:06.448]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:20:06.728 --> 01:20:12.089]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:20:12.289 --> 01:20:19.271]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:20:19.571 --> 01:20:24.915]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:20:25.175 --> 01:20:29.898]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:20:30.239 --> 01:20:37.824]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:20:38.184 --> 01:20:44.427]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:20:44.727 --> 01:20:45.887]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:46.168]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.535 --> 01:20:55.036]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:55.556 --> 01:21:02.679]  Did you know that Bible prophecy talks about the United States, British Commonwealth, Russia, China, and the communist world in the last days?
[01:21:03.499 --> 01:21:09.161]  Did you know that it predicts a confrontation between atheistic communism and the western world of Christianity?
[01:21:09.862 --> 01:21:13.283]  The plans have already been laid and they conform to Bible prophecy.
[01:21:13.983 --> 01:21:23.491]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:25.945 --> 01:21:26.285]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:26.325 --> 01:21:29.286]  Call for a one-year free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[01:21:29.306 --> 01:21:29.887]  It's free.
[01:21:29.907 --> 01:21:32.248]  Call now while our operators are standing by to take your call.
[01:21:51.949 --> 01:21:52.529]  It's a fact.
[01:21:52.730 --> 01:21:57.153]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:21:57.493 --> 01:22:02.697]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:22:02.977 --> 01:22:06.180]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:13.585]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:22:13.926 --> 01:22:21.091]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:22:21.331 --> 01:22:23.432]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[01:22:23.853 --> 01:22:30.177]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[01:22:30.417 --> 01:22:34.220]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:37.122]  Call Day of Jubilee, open 9 a.m.
[01:22:37.162 --> 01:22:37.982]  to 5 p.m.
[01:22:38.042 --> 01:22:39.263]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[01:22:39.283 --> 01:22:39.463]  That's 920-293-8024.
[01:22:39.543 --> 01:22:40.204]  And ask for Robert.
[01:22:40.224 --> 01:22:41.845]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:22:57.676 --> 01:22:59.577]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:00.077 --> 01:23:02.919]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:09.664]  Alright, now these clips are even more powerful with the graphs, but listen carefully.
[01:23:10.365 --> 01:23:13.187]  Go to prisonplano.com and watch the clips for yourself.
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.100]  After the show, or whenever you'd like.
[01:23:16.641 --> 01:23:21.162]  Here is a little clip, the first clip from the great global warming swindle.
[01:23:21.202 --> 01:23:21.582]  Here it is.
[01:23:22.162 --> 01:23:23.982]  Imagine that we live in an age of reason.
[01:23:25.323 --> 01:23:28.863]  And the global warming alarm is dressed up as science.
[01:23:29.243 --> 01:23:30.484]  But it's not science.
[01:23:30.824 --> 01:23:31.704]  It's propaganda.
[01:23:31.964 --> 01:23:35.625]  There's no direct evidence which links 20th century global warming
[01:23:36.670 --> 01:23:37.990]  Of the Virginia greenhouse gases.
[01:23:38.371 --> 01:23:39.971]  We're just being told lies.
[01:23:39.991 --> 01:23:41.331]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:23:41.632 --> 01:23:44.192]  You can't say that CO2 will drive climate.
[01:23:44.232 --> 01:23:45.773]  It certainly never did in the past.
[01:23:46.073 --> 01:23:51.074]  If the CO2 increases in the atmosphere, as a greenhouse gas, then the temperature will go up.
[01:23:52.235 --> 01:23:54.576]  But the ice core record shows exactly the opposite.
[01:23:55.116 --> 01:24:04.419]  So the fundamental assumption, the most fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change, due to humans, is shown to be wrong.
[01:24:04.819 --> 01:24:05.819]  The whole thing stinks.
[01:24:07.364 --> 01:24:11.226]  Man-made global warming is no longer just a theory about climate.
[01:24:11.667 --> 01:24:14.748]  It is the defining moral and political cause of our age.
[01:24:18.851 --> 01:24:21.232]  Campaigners say the time for debate is over.
[01:24:21.632 --> 01:24:27.256]  Any criticism, no matter how scientifically rigorous, is illegitimate, even worse, dangerous.
[01:24:27.576 --> 01:24:35.921]  But in this film, it will be shown that the Earth's climate is always changing.
[01:24:36.877 --> 01:24:46.863]  But there is nothing unusual about the current temperature and that the scientific evidence does not support the notion that climate is driven by carbon dioxide, man-made or otherwise.
[01:24:48.845 --> 01:24:54.828]  Everywhere you are told that man-made climate change is proved beyond doubt.
[01:24:54.908 --> 01:24:56.569]  But you are being told lies.
[01:25:03.462 --> 01:25:04.562]  Alright, that's the first clip.
[01:25:04.602 --> 01:25:06.583]  Let's go ahead and try to jam in the second clip.
[01:25:06.603 --> 01:25:06.983]  Here it is.
[01:25:07.003 --> 01:25:12.124]  The warming of the Earth happened in the wrong place and at the wrong time.
[01:25:13.144 --> 01:25:18.005]  Most of the warming took place in the early part of the 20th century and occurred mostly at the Earth's surface.
[01:25:18.485 --> 01:25:23.327]  The very opposite of what should have happened according to the theory of man-made global warming.
[01:25:25.347 --> 01:25:26.547]  I am Al Gore.
[01:25:26.567 --> 01:25:28.688]  I used to be the next President of the United States.
[01:25:31.499 --> 01:25:41.047]  Former Vice President Al Gore's emotional film, An Inconvenient Truth, is regarded by many as the definitive popular presentation of the theory of man-made global warming.
[01:25:42.549 --> 01:25:54.699]  His argument rests on one all-important piece of evidence, taken from ice core surveys in which scientists drilled deep into the ice to look back into Earth's climate history hundreds of thousands of years.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:59.123]  The first ice core survey took place in Vostok in the Antarctic.
[01:25:59.861 --> 01:26:06.507]  What he found, as Al Gore correctly points out, was a clear correlation between carbon dioxide and temperature.
[01:26:08.448 --> 01:26:11.090]  We're going back in time now, 650,000 years.
[01:26:11.130 --> 01:26:14.453]  Here's what the temperature has been on our Earth.
[01:26:16.595 --> 01:26:21.018]  Now one thing that kind of jumps out at you is, did they ever fit together?
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.261]  Most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
[01:26:25.142 --> 01:26:27.564]  The relationship is actually very complicated.
[01:26:28.399 --> 01:26:33.142]  But there is one relationship that is far more powerful than all the others, and it is this.
[01:26:33.543 --> 01:26:37.465]  When there is more carbon dioxide, the temperature gets warmer.
[01:26:38.626 --> 01:26:42.429]  Al Gore says the relationship between temperature and CO2 is complicated.
[01:26:42.449 --> 01:26:45.431]  But he doesn't say what those complications are.
[01:26:46.312 --> 01:26:50.795]  In fact, there was something very important in the ice core data that he failed to mention.
[01:26:51.698 --> 01:26:59.460]  Professor Ian Clark is a leading Arctic paleoclimatologist who looks back into the Earth's temperature record tens of millions of years.
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:06.342]  When we look at climate on long scales, we're looking for geological material that actually records climate.
[01:27:06.882 --> 01:27:16.805]  If we're to take an ice sample, for example, we use isotopes to reconstruct temperature, but the atmosphere that's imprisoned in that ice, we liberate and then we look at the CO2 content.
[01:27:18.405 --> 01:27:24.669]  Professor Clark and others have indeed discovered, as Al Gore says, a link between carbon dioxide and temperature.
[01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:30.172]  But what Al Gore doesn't say is that the link is the wrong way round.
[01:27:31.093 --> 01:27:42.440]  So here we're looking at the ice core record from Vostok, and in the red we see temperature going up early time, key interval, when we came out of a glaciation.
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:47.843]  And we see the temperature going up, and then we see the CO2 coming up.
[01:27:49.066 --> 01:28:00.496]  There have now been several major ice core surveys.
[01:28:00.996 --> 01:28:02.958]  Every one of them shows the same thing.
[01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:09.583]  The temperature rises or falls, and then, after a few hundred years, carbon dioxide follows.
[01:28:10.464 --> 01:28:14.767]  So obviously, carbon dioxide is not the cause of that warming.
[01:28:15.828 --> 01:28:17.670]  In fact, we can say that the warming
[01:28:18.499 --> 01:28:20.719]  Produced the increase in carbon dioxide.
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.260]  We'll come back, play the third clip.
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:32.281]  It's really very simple science, and then they have hundreds of ice core samples that show the exact same thing.
[01:28:33.202 --> 01:28:37.662]  As usual, what the government and Al Gore are saying is a complete and total hoax.
[01:28:43.323 --> 01:28:44.264]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.704 --> 01:28:46.204]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.223 --> 01:28:49.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.502 --> 01:28:55.223]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:28:55.384 --> 01:28:56.625]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:28:56.865 --> 01:28:59.707]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:29:00.067 --> 01:29:02.829]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:29:03.370 --> 01:29:10.095]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:40.740]  Hey Emily!
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.581]  Wow, you look great!
[01:29:41.601 --> 01:29:42.122]  I feel great!
[01:29:42.202 --> 01:29:43.683]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:29:57.802 --> 01:29:58.102]  Really?
[01:29:58.363 --> 01:29:58.783]  What is it?
[01:29:58.963 --> 01:29:59.384]  How does it work?
[01:29:59.664 --> 01:30:05.949]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[01:30:06.269 --> 01:30:08.331]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:30:08.752 --> 01:30:14.196]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:30:14.436 --> 01:30:14.817]  That's it?
[01:30:15.217 --> 01:30:16.718]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:30:17.059 --> 01:30:17.719]  It is easy.
[01:30:18.159 --> 01:30:24.465]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:30:24.725 --> 01:30:26.086]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:30:26.486 --> 01:30:27.147]  That's amazing!
[01:30:27.507 --> 01:30:32.331]  And, the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:30:32.771 --> 01:30:33.071]  Wow!
[01:30:33.351 --> 01:30:34.352]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[01:30:34.612 --> 01:30:37.373]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[01:30:37.433 --> 01:30:41.095]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.

[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:56.962]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:30:57.362 --> 01:31:00.303]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:31:00.623 --> 01:31:03.184]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:31:03.544 --> 01:31:08.366]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:31:08.746 --> 01:31:14.128]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:31:14.428 --> 01:31:17.389]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[01:31:17.569 --> 01:31:18.130]  We're good to go.
[01:31:39.807 --> 01:31:40.707]  Not economics!
[01:31:40.968 --> 01:31:46.170]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:31:46.190 --> 01:31:46.530]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:50.752]  Alright, let's go ahead and get into the third clip of the great global warming swindle.
[01:32:10.712 --> 01:32:15.877]  And it just covers basic, concrete, hard facts about the planet.
[01:32:15.897 --> 01:32:16.377]  Here it is.
[01:32:17.038 --> 01:32:25.766]  Senior scientists of the Danish Meteorological Institute decided to compile a record of sunspots in the 20th century and compare it with the temperature record.
[01:32:27.367 --> 01:32:34.194]  What they found was an incredibly close correlation between what the sun was doing and changes in temperature on Earth.
[01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:45.118]  Solar activity, they found, rose sharply to 1940, fell back for four decades until the 1970s, and then what was after that?
[01:32:49.882 --> 01:32:56.609]  When we saw this correlation between the temperature and solar activity, or sunspot cycling,
[01:32:57.677 --> 01:33:01.259]  Then people said to us, OK, it can be just a coincidence.
[01:33:01.659 --> 01:33:05.381]  So how can we prove that it's not just a coincidence?
[01:33:05.921 --> 01:33:09.863]  Well, one obvious thing is to have a longer time series or different time series.
[01:33:10.543 --> 01:33:11.844]  Then we went back in time.
[01:33:13.404 --> 01:33:22.769]  So Professor Fries Christensen and his colleagues examined 400 years of astronomical records to compare sunspot activity against temperature variation.
[01:33:24.079 --> 01:33:30.563]  Once again, they found that variations in solar activity were intimately linked to temperature variations.
[01:33:31.963 --> 01:33:38.167]  Was the sun, it seemed, not carbon dioxide or anything else that was driving changes in the climate?
[01:33:39.868 --> 01:33:41.129]  In a way, it's not surprising.
[01:33:41.649 --> 01:33:45.411]  The sun affects us directly, of course, when it sends down its heat.
[01:33:46.151 --> 01:33:50.474]  But we now know that the sun also affects us indirectly through clouds.
[01:33:53.530 --> 01:33:54.711]  Powerful cooling effects.
[01:33:55.091 --> 01:33:56.091]  But how are they formed?
[01:33:56.812 --> 01:34:04.096]  In the early 20th century, scientists discovered that the Earth was constantly being bombarded by subatomic particles.
[01:34:04.436 --> 01:34:12.520]  These particles, which they called cosmic rays, originated, it was believed, from exploding supernovae far beyond our solar system.
[01:34:14.001 --> 01:34:21.065]  When the particles coming down meet water vapor rising up from the sea, they form water droplets and make clouds.
[01:34:22.725 --> 01:34:29.928]  But when the Sun is more active, and the solar wind is strong, fewer particles get through, and fewer clouds are formed.
[01:34:33.929 --> 01:34:49.974]  Just how powerful this effect was, became clear only recently, when an astrophysicist, Professor Neer Shaviv, decided to compare his own record of cloud-forming cosmic rays, with the temperature record created by a geologist, Professor Jan Reitzer, going back 600 million years.
[01:34:52.481 --> 01:34:56.863]  What we found was that when cosmic rays went up, the temperature went down.
[01:34:57.523 --> 01:35:00.024]  When cosmic rays went down, the temperature went up.
[01:35:00.964 --> 01:35:04.406]  Clouds and the Earth's climate were very closely linked.
[01:35:04.966 --> 01:35:07.367]  To see how close, you just flip the lines.
[01:35:08.427 --> 01:35:13.249]  We just compared the graphs, just put them one upon the other, and it was just amazing.
[01:35:13.489 --> 01:35:15.010]  Jan Weiser looked at me and said, you know,
[01:35:16.045 --> 01:35:17.866]  We have very exclusive data here.
[01:35:18.266 --> 01:35:26.991]  I've never seen such vastly different records coming together so beautifully to show really what was happening over that long period of time.
[01:35:29.092 --> 01:35:31.133]  All right, and that's the three clips I've been able to see.
[01:35:31.173 --> 01:35:33.755]  I'm told now the whole film is floating around on Google.
[01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:35.816]  But again, I've already read all these reports.
[01:35:35.836 --> 01:35:37.297]  I've interviewed many of these individuals.
[01:35:37.317 --> 01:35:42.980]  We're going to be getting them on the show again and some of the other folks on the TV show that you were just sharing the program.
[01:35:44.793 --> 01:35:54.036]  Bottom line, the sun, ladies and gentlemen, is a giant ball of gas, and it's the main heating mechanism of the earth.
[01:35:54.096 --> 01:35:55.416]  That's not debatable.
[01:35:56.797 --> 01:36:07.240]  At night it cools down and gets dark, and during the day that's when the plants grow their photosynthesis, and it's the sun that heats up the oceans and heats up your body.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.640]  You get a suntan under it.
[01:36:09.429 --> 01:36:15.251]  And I know most of you know this, but the people that believe in man-made global warming just can't understand this.
[01:36:17.331 --> 01:36:38.557]  And they can correlate the sun's brightness with the Earth heating up, but what this is saying is that more importantly than that is the nuclei of the different particles coming in to the atmosphere help water vapor condense and form clouds.
[01:36:40.856 --> 01:36:42.517]  And then that leads us into chemtrails.
[01:36:44.378 --> 01:36:52.144]  How has our atmosphere changed that until 1996, condensation trails disappeared in a maximum of about two minutes?
[01:36:53.084 --> 01:36:56.226]  And now our skies are completely different and these things stay up there for hours.
[01:36:57.447 --> 01:37:01.450]  We're going to be getting some experts on to discuss this next week, but that's a separate area.
[01:37:02.333 --> 01:37:10.536]  But now, government textbooks, we just talked to a meteorologist, he said, well, yes, there is some things being sprayed, but that's the sunscreen for the Earth.
[01:37:10.996 --> 01:37:12.937]  That federally written textbook says that.
[01:37:12.957 --> 01:37:14.537]  Discovery Channel basically said that.
[01:37:15.018 --> 01:37:17.578]  It's a secret program, but it's all for our own good.
[01:37:19.219 --> 01:37:25.321]  And it is true that these type of nuclei, being put into the atmosphere artificially, would cause a cooling.
[01:37:26.802 --> 01:37:28.542]  Heaven knows what's really going on.
[01:37:28.562 --> 01:37:30.323]  I mean, frankly, we don't.
[01:37:31.209 --> 01:37:35.910]  There's a lot of weird behavior happening and a lot of strange behavior going on.
[01:37:37.611 --> 01:37:49.374]  And I do not believe that most of the spraying that we see is bioweapons or chemical weapons or radiological weapons being directed or mass inoculations of some have said on the benevolent side.
[01:37:52.835 --> 01:37:57.836]  But that's mainly because something sprayed at 30,000 feet is not going to hit you where you're at.
[01:37:57.856 --> 01:37:59.777]  It can hit somewhere thousands, about tens of thousands.
[01:38:00.476 --> 01:38:01.037]  of miles away.
[01:38:01.077 --> 01:38:10.944]  Now there are thousands of publicly admitted examples of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft spraying at a thousand feet or lower near cities with chemical, biologicals, radiologicals.
[01:38:10.964 --> 01:38:12.004]  I mean, that's on the record.
[01:38:12.585 --> 01:38:15.587]  But the people that cover chemtrails never want to talk about that.
[01:38:16.087 --> 01:38:17.248]  It's kind of like a religion.
[01:38:17.288 --> 01:38:24.333]  They just want to talk about the big planes up in the sky, which the evidence points towards weather modification.
[01:38:25.194 --> 01:38:29.437]  Now the barium salts and aluminum oxides they're using are not good for you.
[01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:34.211]  And it's a huge secret program, and it's certainly going on.
[01:38:35.072 --> 01:38:43.918]  But I don't subscribe to the orthodoxy that this is some type of chemical or biological attack from 35,000 to 25,000 feet.
[01:38:45.819 --> 01:38:50.462]  So that's where I stand on that, just trying to study this, racking my brain, looking at it.
[01:38:52.503 --> 01:38:56.026]  I am not debating the fact that the sun is going wild.
[01:38:56.946 --> 01:39:00.909]  I am not debating the fact that the earth has not heated up some, but that
[01:39:01.847 --> 01:39:13.229]  Heating has radically decreased in its acceleration since the 40s, but the sun now is heating up again to a record level, and so who knows what's going to happen?
[01:39:13.829 --> 01:39:21.871]  But the point is, you read Roman history, Greek history, Babylonian, Sanskrit, I mean, there's climate change happening.
[01:39:21.931 --> 01:39:27.232]  Volcanoes exploding, huge earthquakes, islands disappearing, islands being formed overnight,
[01:39:29.151 --> 01:39:36.056]  All sorts of earth changes happening, and the major body of science is moving now towards a younger earth.
[01:39:36.176 --> 01:39:38.297]  And I'm not debating how old the earth is.
[01:39:39.078 --> 01:39:45.122]  I think there's been a false debate between Christianity and science, where they set the two sides against each other as a distraction.
[01:39:46.403 --> 01:39:50.085]  But the scientists are saying things are looking like they happened quicker than they thought.
[01:39:50.586 --> 01:39:58.031]  And you can debate that all day, whether it's hundreds of millions, billions, or what others say that's really pulled out of nowhere.
[01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:00.461]  You know, the Earth's 6,000 years old.
[01:40:00.501 --> 01:40:01.581]  That's not in the Bible.
[01:40:01.641 --> 01:40:05.083]  It's just some calculation off days some preacher cooked up.
[01:40:05.103 --> 01:40:07.283]  And then they... It's just mindlessness.
[01:40:08.444 --> 01:40:10.045]  I just don't even know what to say anymore.
[01:40:11.805 --> 01:40:20.909]  It's just mind-boggling that you have this new religion
[01:40:22.219 --> 01:40:23.661]  In fact, here's the UK Daily Mail.
[01:40:24.061 --> 01:40:26.263]  Global warming, the bogus religion of our age.
[01:40:26.303 --> 01:40:28.825]  The world is heading for environmental catastrophe.
[01:40:29.346 --> 01:40:32.869]  Or so we are constantly being told by politicians and self-appointed experts.
[01:40:33.230 --> 01:40:39.015]  They warn us that unless we take drastic action, the Earth will soon be devastated by climate change and global warming.
[01:40:39.516 --> 01:40:40.917]  Entire species will be lost.
[01:40:40.977 --> 01:40:42.018]  Crops will be obliterated.
[01:40:42.458 --> 01:40:44.680]  Floods and famine will sweep across the planet.
[01:40:45.021 --> 01:40:47.163]  And Western economies will slide into depression.
[01:40:47.683 --> 01:40:58.530]  Tonight, Channel 4 will broadcast the Great Global Warming Swindle, which suggests the whole subject has been such a political hot potato that other explanations for climate change are not being properly examined.
[01:41:00.611 --> 01:41:14.099]  And it goes on, certainly there have been many sweeping predictions of global ruin, few more emphatic than the report from Sir Nicholas Stern in the Economics of Climate Change, which states that with an air of
[01:41:14.995 --> 01:41:16.156]  Challengable conviction.
[01:41:16.536 --> 01:41:18.317]  The scientific evidence is now overwhelming.
[01:41:18.337 --> 01:41:23.420]  Climate change presents very serious global risk and it demands an urgent global response.
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:36.967]  His study commissioned by the government in July 2005 and published amid much Whitehall hype in 2006 seemed to carry all the more weight because Stern is one of the most senior civil servants in Britain, the head of the government's economic service.
[01:41:38.439 --> 01:41:46.025]  His conclusions appeared to be based on powerful scientific authority since his team of 20 or so officials had drawn a wide range of published papers and data.
[01:41:46.525 --> 01:41:53.811]  Tony Blair has described it as the most important document produced during his 10 years as Prime Minister and urged that the Stern Blueprint
[01:41:55.023 --> 01:41:58.247]  With its calls for more regulation and taxation be adopted in full.
[01:41:58.527 --> 01:42:10.020]  The disaster is not set to happen in some science fiction future, but in our lifetime, said Blair, who went on to claim that the world faces nothing more serious, more urgent, and more demanding of its leadership than climate change.
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:15.486]  All this has helped put the Stern Report at the very forefront of the debate, the central theme of it,
[01:42:16.261 --> 01:42:24.249]  is that there is a near universal consensus of opinion with scientific community about the dangers of climate change but this is not true.
[01:42:24.489 --> 01:42:26.190]  This article goes on for four more pages.
[01:42:26.210 --> 01:42:27.231]  You need to go read it.
[01:42:27.672 --> 01:42:41.885]  There is no such unanimity among scientists throughout the 550 pages of the document Stern continually strikes a confident note as if there were no dispute about the issues completely divorced from scientific reality.
[01:42:42.834 --> 01:42:46.496]  That this self-assured stance is completely divorced from the side of reality.
[01:42:47.137 --> 01:42:54.101]  It is an inconvenient truth for Stern and his political allies that there is, in fact, precious little evidence to back up his sweeping claims.
[01:42:54.981 --> 01:43:02.906]  In a revealing recent comment, Stern admitted that when he was appointed by the government, he had an idea what the greenhouse effect was, but wasn't really sure.
[01:43:03.347 --> 01:43:07.429]  This lack of understanding of science shines through every chapter of his report.
[01:43:07.849 --> 01:43:08.550]  He is guilty of
[01:43:09.571 --> 01:43:23.300]  Leading the data of distorting the evidence to suit his political master's dogma, of throwing numbers about with reckless abandon, of promoting alarmism in a place of rational discussion, and of reinventing climate history.
[01:43:24.161 --> 01:43:26.382]  There are fundamental misconceptions throughout the document.
[01:43:26.682 --> 01:43:36.569]  He seems to think the climate prediction is a mature science stretching back to the 19th century, hence the confident tone, science stretching back to the early century, hence the confident tone of his pronouncements.
[01:43:37.854 --> 01:43:44.695]  But in reality, climate prediction is relatively modern science, which has emerged only in recent decades thanks partly to the emergence of computers.
[01:43:45.476 --> 01:43:50.217]  And it just goes on and on through the bad information and we don't have time to cover it all.
[01:43:52.217 --> 01:43:53.917]  But let's be clear about this.
[01:43:54.137 --> 01:43:57.578]  Let's say man-made global warming is real.
[01:43:57.618 --> 01:44:00.379]  Let's set it aside and agree with the hoax.
[01:44:01.079 --> 01:44:02.079]  I'm not debating you.
[01:44:02.668 --> 01:44:04.548]  Those of you out there listening are freaking out right now.
[01:44:05.129 --> 01:44:06.409]  I'm not debating you.
[01:44:06.529 --> 01:44:07.629]  Let's say it's real.
[01:44:09.249 --> 01:44:18.272]  What does a global tax, and by global it's only on industrialized nations, but they're from New Zealand to England to the United States and Canada.
[01:44:19.912 --> 01:44:21.452]  Less than 20 countries will be under it.
[01:44:22.372 --> 01:44:26.493]  China, India, Mexico, they're not under it.
[01:44:27.914 --> 01:44:29.294]  160 plus countries are not under it.
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:55.008]  How does a global tax paid into the IMF and World Bank and United Nations and served out to expand more global enforcement, more laws, and quote, strengthening global laws for the environment, so if you shovel sand off your garden on your beachfront beach house, you get five months in jail and a million dollar fine?
[01:44:57.373 --> 01:45:00.634]  How does that do anything?
[01:45:00.834 --> 01:45:02.034]  It does nothing.
[01:45:02.114 --> 01:45:05.775]  It will not curb or reduce the greenhouse gases.
[01:45:05.815 --> 01:45:14.077]  And I will tell you again, this documentary only looks at the sun and solar radiation and cosmic radiation.
[01:45:14.097 --> 01:45:19.178]  And it looks at ice core samples and proves itself conclusively.
[01:45:20.618 --> 01:45:24.879]  But you add into this the CO2 that plants can
[01:45:25.888 --> 01:45:32.794]  Successfully double, and if there's enough water, more than triple their carbon dioxide uptake.
[01:45:33.094 --> 01:45:34.335]  And then do you know what they do?
[01:45:35.376 --> 01:45:48.628]  They then put out oxygen, and major studies show that humans live longer, do better, have less cancer, as well as all their animal life, from animal-based plankton right up to your Savannah lion.
[01:45:50.851 --> 01:46:06.321]  That they've done ice core samples, the earth has had much higher oxygen in the past, displacing and having an increased saturation above other gases that we do not use.
[01:46:07.421 --> 01:46:14.025]  We use oxygen that's a symbiotic relationship between animal and plant life.
[01:46:15.066 --> 01:46:19.869]  When new carbon dioxide is emitted,
[01:46:21.630 --> 01:46:25.854]  When levels go up, plants grow faster and are healthier.
[01:46:26.414 --> 01:46:28.536]  More oxygen is put out by the plants.
[01:46:28.556 --> 01:46:30.197]  They breathe carbon dioxide.
[01:46:30.578 --> 01:46:32.199]  They expel oxygen.
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:34.401]  It's the main chain of life.
[01:46:35.702 --> 01:46:37.243]  That's better for us.
[01:46:37.343 --> 01:46:44.910]  The earth actually has a low oxygen level compared to what it had 15,000 years ago from the ice samples.
[01:46:45.592 --> 01:46:47.833]  There's less oxygen now.
[01:46:48.254 --> 01:46:51.476]  We want more CO2.
[01:46:55.198 --> 01:47:01.302]  The plankton in the sea, what's the plankton called?
[01:47:01.382 --> 01:47:05.564]  Photoplankton, does better when there's more carbon dioxide.
[01:47:05.985 --> 01:47:09.887]  It increases the amount of food chain life above it.
[01:47:10.608 --> 01:47:14.450]  From the krell, shrimp, right up to the blue whale.
[01:47:17.396 --> 01:47:21.157]  I mean, when you start studying science, it's so simple.
[01:47:22.017 --> 01:47:23.437]  Because we have the data.
[01:47:25.898 --> 01:47:30.839]  And it's like when they said, oh, we've got to ban fluorocarbons.
[01:47:31.679 --> 01:47:33.379]  We've got to ban CO2.
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.220]  Because it's eating the ozone layer.
[01:47:38.261 --> 01:47:42.901]  And now they've found that there's always holes in the ozone layer during certain parts of the year on the poles.
[01:47:43.642 --> 01:47:44.902]  And that it wildly shifts.
[01:47:48.257 --> 01:48:07.768]  But again, they tell you that ozone is being produced in the atmosphere, destroying it, when ozone drops to the ground and doesn't get into the atmosphere at those levels, and that it basically breaks down in a matter of minutes with other compounds and is good for the environment.
[01:48:07.988 --> 01:48:16.093]  But see, Dow Chemical and DuPont's two separate patents on Freon were running out, and so they made the entire world
[01:48:17.665 --> 01:48:21.609]  With the West starting first, we're the suckers, the marks.
[01:48:22.630 --> 01:48:24.852]  Adopt new refrigeration systems.
[01:48:24.872 --> 01:48:29.837]  You have any idea how big that trillion plus dollar a year industry is?
[01:48:30.257 --> 01:48:33.700]  And have the new patents on what was universally adopted.
[01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:37.524]  Fraud after hoax after scam.
[01:48:43.112 --> 01:48:45.576]  It just makes my head spin sometimes.
[01:48:46.757 --> 01:48:55.128]  They're so mad they can't get the Kyoto Protocol, they're so mad they can't force this into place, that they have got sports illustrated and that's it folks!
[01:49:01.022 --> 01:49:01.663]  Big Brother.
[01:49:02.324 --> 01:49:03.385]  Mainstream media.
[01:49:04.086 --> 01:49:05.208]  Government cover-ups.
[01:49:05.869 --> 01:49:06.670]  You want answers?
[01:49:07.431 --> 01:49:08.312]  Well, so does he.
[01:49:08.332 --> 01:49:12.798]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:17.265]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:49:20.249 --> 01:49:25.113]  Already into hour number three on this live Friday edition, the ninth day of March 2007.
[01:49:25.414 --> 01:49:29.217]  I'll be back live on the radio Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:49:29.237 --> 01:49:31.819]  Another great syndicated broadcast we're doing.
[01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:34.622]  Wide open phones in this hour and a ton of news.
[01:49:35.022 --> 01:49:36.984]  John in Texas, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[01:49:37.004 --> 01:49:39.486]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:39.926]  Good sir.
[01:49:39.946 --> 01:49:45.451]  A while ago I bought a series, a Walt Disney series on DVD called Swamp Fox.
[01:49:46.394 --> 01:49:49.496]  Well, Francis Marion, the Revolutionary War guerrilla fighter?
[01:49:49.696 --> 01:49:52.057]  Yes, that's the movie the Patriots fashioned after.
[01:49:52.698 --> 01:50:05.305]  Anyway, in that series, they had a chapter called, Brother Against Brother, Neighbor Against Neighbor, and it told about the size, a whole lot of populations sided with the English Crown, the British King, and they waged total war on their fellow Americans.
[01:50:05.345 --> 01:50:06.386]  And they were called Tories.
[01:50:06.646 --> 01:50:07.746]  Yeah, Tory Americans.
[01:50:08.547 --> 01:50:15.471]  And so it's always been that way through our history, same with the Civil War, and it's going to be that way when this new world order comes around, we're going to have a sizable
[01:50:16.323 --> 01:50:18.244]  A portion of the population are going to turn against us.
[01:50:21.126 --> 01:50:23.407]  That's right, they'll grovel to any tyranny they see.
[01:50:25.028 --> 01:50:29.271]  And I don't, you know, as much as you preach and put the facts out there, some people you just ain't going to reach.
[01:50:29.291 --> 01:50:31.932]  They're just going to call us traitors and they're just going to turn on us, that's all.
[01:50:32.512 --> 01:50:36.034]  That's because deep down they're afraid and they want to serve the biggest bully they can find.
[01:50:36.054 --> 01:50:38.576]  Yeah, it's that way.
[01:50:39.016 --> 01:50:43.499]  It was that way in Nazi Germany and a while ago in Russia there was a big demonstration that
[01:50:44.164 --> 01:50:46.805]  There were thousands of people on the street wishing Joe Stalin was back.
[01:50:46.845 --> 01:50:50.047]  That's just the way it's going to be.
[01:50:50.067 --> 01:50:51.088]  That's all, Alex.
[01:50:51.128 --> 01:50:52.048]  I appreciate your call.
[01:50:52.088 --> 01:50:52.889]  Great point, John.
[01:50:53.329 --> 01:50:54.850]  Andy in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:50:56.250 --> 01:50:57.131]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:50:57.171 --> 01:50:58.091]  Good to talk to you again.
[01:50:58.292 --> 01:50:58.972]  Good to talk to you.
[01:50:59.352 --> 01:51:01.833]  I have a couple of comments and then a question for you.
[01:51:01.853 --> 01:51:04.915]  Do me a favor, turn the radio off.
[01:51:05.715 --> 01:51:06.656]  Okay, sorry about that.
[01:51:06.696 --> 01:51:07.536]  I don't normally do that.
[01:51:09.818 --> 01:51:10.298]  First of all,
[01:51:11.094 --> 01:51:15.956]  I was listening to Michael Savage a few months ago, and he was actually talking about the North American Union.
[01:51:16.556 --> 01:51:19.437]  And he was taking credit for being on the cutting edge of that.
[01:51:19.477 --> 01:51:24.518]  He claims that he's been talking about that for six years, when you've been talking about it for ten years.
[01:51:25.278 --> 01:51:27.879]  Well, I've also heard him say, we must support Bush.
[01:51:27.899 --> 01:51:29.420]  He's fighting the New World Order.
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:32.901]  That's like saying Hitler was fighting the Nazis.
[01:51:33.621 --> 01:51:35.882]  That's what's so dangerous about these neocons.
[01:51:35.902 --> 01:51:40.343]  They get it right on a couple of issues, and they make their audience think they're right on every issue.
[01:51:41.789 --> 01:51:43.151]  They have to do that, and they do it.
[01:51:44.011 --> 01:51:48.094]  And my other comment is, yesterday I called a local talk show.
[01:51:49.776 --> 01:51:53.359]  He's a liberal host, but he's very much against the open borders.
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:52:00.104]  And I'm not tooting my own horn, I just want to let your audience know what an effect one call can make.
[01:52:00.865 --> 01:52:02.506]  I called about the North American Union.
[01:52:02.686 --> 01:52:04.848]  And you shifted the whole show's discussion?
[01:52:06.029 --> 01:52:07.110]  Yeah, that happened, and plus,
[01:52:10.014 --> 01:52:13.357]  Well, I mentioned that Barack Obama is for open borders.
[01:52:14.037 --> 01:52:16.059]  And he's never talked about the border issue.
[01:52:16.699 --> 01:52:28.088]  And how all the candidates that are running, that are being the media's darlings, like John McCain, Giuliani, you know who I'm talking about.
[01:52:29.028 --> 01:52:30.790]  It's because of the corporate controlled media.
[01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:33.412]  And I just went on about that.
[01:52:33.592 --> 01:52:37.735]  And the candidates that are against open borders, you're not hearing about in the media.
[01:52:38.547 --> 01:52:39.548]  Well, I had a friend call me.
[01:52:39.648 --> 01:52:40.989]  He actually heard me on the radio.
[01:52:41.569 --> 01:52:43.410]  And he said, a very good call, and I woke him up.
[01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:45.611]  And he's an African-American guy.
[01:52:45.651 --> 01:52:48.473]  And, you know, I would assume that he'd be supporting Obama.
[01:52:48.533 --> 01:52:49.414]  And he goes, you know, you're right.
[01:52:49.454 --> 01:52:52.095]  I've never heard Obama talk about the borders.
[01:52:52.596 --> 01:52:53.536]  Well, I mean, here's the thing.
[01:52:53.636 --> 01:52:55.357]  Farrakhan is supporting Obama.
[01:52:55.717 --> 01:52:59.320]  I don't care if Obama was green or purple or polka-dotted and pink.
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:03.782]  I would vote for somebody if they were pro-borders, pro-sovereignty.
[01:53:03.842 --> 01:53:04.823]  He's a globalist.
[01:53:05.323 --> 01:53:06.364]  He's New World Order.
[01:53:08.271 --> 01:53:12.576]  He's not talking about how they grab black kids and test drugs and pesticides on them.
[01:53:12.596 --> 01:53:14.137]  He's not talking about AIDS in Africa.
[01:53:15.038 --> 01:53:16.560]  These guys are all bought and paid for.
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:18.321]  He's just as bad as Hillary or any of them.
[01:53:19.363 --> 01:53:27.110]  But if we can make a call to a talk radio show and a friend calls you back and you woke him up, I just wonder how many people we can wake up that we don't even know.
[01:53:27.831 --> 01:53:29.132]  I just want to urge your audience, you know,
[01:53:29.961 --> 01:53:31.542]  Get on the radio if that's all I can do.
[01:53:32.002 --> 01:53:32.502]  Exactly!
[01:53:32.542 --> 01:53:40.066]  Call them to talk shows, start blogs, get on message boards, make copies of films, tell folks about this broadcast that just grows by leaps and bounds.
[01:53:40.506 --> 01:53:43.768]  You're listening on AM or FM, tell your friends and family to tune in every day.
[01:53:43.828 --> 01:53:49.091]  Tell people at Red Lights, hey, I'll be driving to do my radio show and I'll just stop and say, hey, tune into this station.
[01:53:49.691 --> 01:53:50.632]  I mean, I do it myself.
[01:53:50.852 --> 01:53:52.152]  I do it at grocery store lines.
[01:53:52.533 --> 01:53:53.153]  We'll be right back.
[01:53:57.107 --> 01:54:00.669]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:01.209]  are located?
[01:54:01.429 --> 01:54:04.811]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:54:05.031 --> 01:54:09.733]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:54:10.013 --> 01:54:16.956]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas, brewing environmental catastrophes,
[01:54:17.216 --> 01:54:17.837]  We're good to go.
[01:54:35.114 --> 01:54:35.374]  I think so.
[01:54:59.501 --> 01:55:04.967]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:55:05.347 --> 01:55:12.995]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:55:13.695 --> 01:55:20.776]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:55:21.136 --> 01:55:32.558]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:55:32.858 --> 01:55:36.799]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:55:36.819 --> 01:55:38.759]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:55:39.079 --> 01:55:42.920]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:55:58.211 --> 01:56:02.354]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:56:02.574 --> 01:56:04.335]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:56:04.596 --> 01:56:10.880]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:17.304]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:56:17.545 --> 01:56:23.589]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:56:23.869 --> 01:56:30.271]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:56:30.411 --> 01:56:33.952]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:56:34.252 --> 01:56:37.953]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:56:38.133 --> 01:56:40.674]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:56:40.814 --> 01:56:41.874]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:56:42.154 --> 01:56:45.136]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:56:45.156 --> 01:56:46.857]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:13.055 --> 01:57:17.339]  One of the National Firefighter Associations is saying they don't want Giuliani coming to speak to their group.
[01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:19.201]  I'll tell you why later.
[01:57:20.162 --> 01:57:21.543]  More on black men in the U.S.
[01:57:21.563 --> 01:57:24.146]  being almost seven times more likely to have HIV.
[01:57:24.766 --> 01:57:25.527]  Why is that?
[01:57:26.988 --> 01:57:29.110]  But right now let's continue with open phones.
[01:57:29.130 --> 01:57:30.732]  I also have a clip I want to play later.
[01:57:31.492 --> 01:57:33.534]  It's like 15 minutes long.
[01:57:33.574 --> 01:57:38.279]  I can't play it all, but it's a great cartoon slash video clips that
[01:57:39.745 --> 01:57:47.328]  A listener to this show has put together on YouTube two parts, and just with the audio alone, it's powerful.
[01:57:48.609 --> 01:57:50.910]  Just a lot of talented people out there.
[01:57:51.490 --> 01:57:53.611]  So we'll try to play some of that, too, before the show ends.
[01:57:53.631 --> 01:57:58.753]  We've got 51 minutes left in broadcast time on this Friday edition.
[01:57:59.413 --> 01:58:02.695]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Rick in New York.
[01:58:02.795 --> 01:58:03.475]  Rick, you're on the air.
[01:58:04.255 --> 01:58:05.336]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[01:58:05.996 --> 01:58:09.259]  I got about two minutes ahead to write this down before my phone goes dead.
[01:58:09.379 --> 01:58:10.460]  You're doing a great job.
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:15.724]  The only other people talking about the North American Union is Ron Paul and Lou Dobbs.
[01:58:16.605 --> 01:58:21.309]  You can sign a petition online, North Americans against the North American Union.
[01:58:22.670 --> 01:58:30.256]  I wrote, how dare anyone subvert the sovereignty of our great nation for a North American Union and for what?
[01:58:30.856 --> 01:58:32.498]  A more cheap junk at Walmart?
[01:58:32.778 --> 01:58:33.839]  Any politician not
[01:58:35.114 --> 01:58:38.155]  Addressing this should be charged with treason.
[01:58:38.836 --> 01:58:44.918]  Well, it was treason that George Bush brought us into that system illegally without Congress being involved in March of 2005.
[01:58:46.219 --> 01:58:46.499]  Right.
[01:58:46.539 --> 01:58:48.780]  No, I just wrote a thing down so I didn't forget.
[01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:53.962]  And now I read on Rents.com that Bush is sticking to the U.S.
[01:58:54.002 --> 01:59:00.584]  truckers by allowing the uninspected substandard Mexican trucks in the country within 60 days, I guess.
[01:59:00.644 --> 01:59:02.465]  Well, see, that's already been going on.
[01:59:02.525 --> 01:59:02.725]  Right.
[01:59:05.419 --> 01:59:09.242]  They'll be doing the jobs American truckers won't, at least for slave wages, right?
[01:59:10.222 --> 01:59:19.888]  But also, I have to apologize to you for calling you a left gatekeeper after reading on Cloak & Dagger, but I never hear them talk about the North American Union on their site.
[01:59:20.409 --> 01:59:33.677]  They push to Al Gore, but I've been reading to Al, he pushes the idea of the New Age religion, the cult of Gaia, Mother Earth, as a god, which is really paganism, Luciferian, and Masonic ideology.
[01:59:34.475 --> 01:59:37.516]  Some believe in the War God, Moon God, and Sun God.
[01:59:38.396 --> 01:59:40.396]  I believe in the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[01:59:41.056 --> 01:59:42.116]  Keep up the good work, Alex!
[01:59:42.296 --> 01:59:43.597]  I appreciate your call.
[01:59:44.097 --> 01:59:51.698]  Look, there's a lot of shows and people that attack me, and they do it because they are enraged with jealousy.
[01:59:52.578 --> 02:00:00.700]  And I don't know what they're jealous of, that I work 16 plus hours a day, that I'm highly focused, that we
[02:00:02.819 --> 02:00:07.641]  I mean, we're just basically here in like an ant farm, an ant hill, slaving.
[02:00:09.201 --> 02:00:12.383]  And there's all these egomaniacs and people who try to attack us.
[02:00:12.643 --> 02:00:13.803]  We don't care.
[02:00:13.963 --> 02:00:15.184]  And I don't care if you attack me.
[02:00:15.204 --> 02:00:16.084]  It means nothing to me.
[02:00:17.205 --> 02:00:24.907]  I do what I do because I'm desperate to try to save this country and I want my children to grow up in a free society and not the nightmare that's being prepared for them.
[02:00:26.168 --> 02:00:30.250]  And I do what I do because I want righteousness.
[02:00:30.450 --> 02:00:31.250]  I want goodness.
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:33.241]  I want to do the right thing.
[02:00:34.281 --> 02:00:35.622]  I want to be a man of my word.
[02:00:35.642 --> 02:00:40.084]  I want to stand up against corruption and bullies.
[02:00:41.225 --> 02:00:42.506]  And that's all I've ever tried to do.
[02:00:45.747 --> 02:00:48.549]  But there's a lot of people in this movement who are in it for the wrong reasons.
[02:00:49.249 --> 02:00:51.971]  And most of them aren't in the grassroots, they're in the leadership positions.
[02:00:53.451 --> 02:00:56.192]  It's a thorn in our side, you could say.
[02:00:56.792 --> 02:00:57.753]  But that doesn't matter.
[02:00:57.813 --> 02:00:59.293]  We should all just move forward.
[02:00:59.914 --> 02:01:01.154]  I try to tell the truth.
[02:01:01.314 --> 02:01:02.815]  I try to make the right decisions.
[02:01:02.915 --> 02:01:04.195]  I try to get the news right.
[02:01:04.656 --> 02:01:06.476]  I try to give you the best picture I can.
[02:01:06.956 --> 02:01:08.577]  I try to analyze what's happening.
[02:01:08.697 --> 02:01:10.258]  I try to give you an accurate picture.
[02:01:10.278 --> 02:01:11.338]  We don't claim to be perfect.
[02:01:12.018 --> 02:01:13.479]  But we are the best there is.
[02:01:14.499 --> 02:01:15.600]  No brag, just fact.
[02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:17.341]  And that is quite a weight.
[02:01:17.961 --> 02:01:19.021]  That is quite a duty.
[02:01:19.081 --> 02:01:20.642]  That is quite a responsibility.
[02:01:21.855 --> 02:01:27.181]  It is also scary to be the most effective, and that doesn't mean I'm very effective.
[02:01:27.802 --> 02:01:30.806]  But together we can bring this new world order down with God's help.
[02:01:35.131 --> 02:01:36.513]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:01:37.574 --> 02:01:39.437]  Let's go ahead and talk to Richard in Texas.
[02:01:39.517 --> 02:01:40.198]  Richard, go ahead.
[02:01:41.184 --> 02:01:44.785]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted to make a comment about the chemtrails today.
[02:01:45.205 --> 02:01:52.488]  To my mind, that's a, you know, just a small picture of the complete, asleep nature of the American people.
[02:01:52.948 --> 02:02:04.872]  You know, those things have been so obvious, and you talk to people about them, and even when you bring the subject up and you point out the function in the sky and do things that are totally bizarre, they just refuse to see.
[02:02:05.052 --> 02:02:06.873]  They weren't there ten years ago!
[02:02:07.666 --> 02:02:08.026]  Oh, no!
[02:02:08.206 --> 02:02:10.367]  You know, it's clear that this is something new.
[02:02:10.467 --> 02:02:14.209]  Deformulated jet fuel theory makes no sense at all.
[02:02:14.289 --> 02:02:16.910]  Otherwise, they'd be there coming in very plain all the time.
[02:02:17.551 --> 02:02:23.193]  And, you know, to me, it just points out to the bigger problem we have with people seeing what's going on.
[02:02:25.074 --> 02:02:26.455]  There's so much going on.
[02:02:26.475 --> 02:02:29.796]  I mean, our whole economic system is a hoax and a fraud and is staged.
[02:02:30.856 --> 02:02:32.517]  The religious leaders have been bought off.
[02:02:32.557 --> 02:02:33.958]  The society's falling apart.
[02:02:34.018 --> 02:02:36.279]  Every real indicator shows we're in massive decline.
[02:02:37.248 --> 02:02:41.769]  And I just, it's just, the people running things are just completely nuts.
[02:02:42.489 --> 02:02:42.929]  Amazing.
[02:02:42.969 --> 02:02:48.171]  I just, you know, I hope we can get through economic collapse before we can get to all these other issues that we're facing.
[02:02:49.651 --> 02:02:50.451]  I hear you, my friend.
[02:02:50.491 --> 02:02:51.012]  Anything else?
[02:02:51.552 --> 02:02:57.053]  Yeah, just, Alex, if you have any comment about RBN and the microstations, I'd be interested to hear.
[02:02:58.273 --> 02:03:04.515]  You know, I have nothing to do with either one of those things, and people could never differentiate the difference
[02:03:05.302 --> 02:03:11.807]  Between any of that and so how do you even how do you even discuss something that you don't even understand?
[02:03:11.827 --> 02:03:14.509]  I mean, that's really what it comes down to.
[02:03:14.529 --> 02:03:20.953]  I had experiences, though.
[02:03:20.973 --> 02:03:28.538]  I guess this would be the best best analogy or best parallel for what you just raised.
[02:03:29.739 --> 02:03:33.722]  Well, before I answer that question, let me just tell you, I don't get depressed
[02:03:36.952 --> 02:03:41.053]  Per se, I just get overwhelmed.
[02:03:41.193 --> 02:03:46.095]  It's more of a frustration, because I'm not up to the task.
[02:03:49.996 --> 02:04:00.439]  And that is, I'm doing research right now, and Aaron Dykes is doing intensive research right now, for the film I'm making that is so important that I'd rather do nothing else but that.
[02:04:01.079 --> 02:04:04.040]  Because I have to do it in my extra time, and then it just...
[02:04:04.992 --> 02:04:08.915]  It just burns me up with frustration wanting to be able to get to work on it.
[02:04:08.955 --> 02:04:12.357]  We're trying and having so much evidence.
[02:04:13.318 --> 02:04:34.333]  We've been doing intensive research for about four or five months on eugenics, time at the library, on the computer, eugenics.org, reading the letters, the documents, and it's so evil and so admitted that you can't even
[02:04:35.845 --> 02:04:36.986]  Properly discuss it!
[02:04:40.389 --> 02:04:43.272]  There's so much of it!
[02:04:43.332 --> 02:04:44.573]  But this is the bottom line.
[02:04:45.153 --> 02:04:47.775]  This is what I've brought away from it.
[02:04:49.257 --> 02:04:59.766]  And I already knew this, but to then read the Bibles of the canons of the eugenics movement from a hundred years ago right through to six months ago.
[02:05:01.915 --> 02:05:09.703]  It is the elite's religion of elitism and power and dominance and feudalism and an excuse to dominate and enslave populations.
[02:05:12.746 --> 02:05:15.669]  It is their excuse to be as abusive and bad as they want.
[02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:23.457]  They say in these books that the religion of internationalism is eugenics and population reduction.
[02:05:25.390 --> 02:05:37.514]  They openly stated, I mean the head of the UN's UNESCO program wrote a book on it, UN documents, thousands of pages of CIA documents, this is declassified!
[02:05:38.334 --> 02:05:51.819]  Where they're openly talking about how they're going to cull us, and one-child policy us, and kill us, and build police states to control us, and I mean reading it, seeing it, and then seeing my fellow man
[02:05:53.073 --> 02:06:01.858]  Around me, a different strata, unable, some of the public unable to even understand what I'm saying, others arguing with us.
[02:06:02.838 --> 02:06:08.281]  I mean, it's so much worse than we can even say, and people are debating us who won't even check out what we're claiming.
[02:06:10.863 --> 02:06:14.244]  And then that leads me into the next issue that the caller mentioned.
[02:06:15.705 --> 02:06:21.148]  Then I see people in this, quote, alternative media movement, truth movement, whatever you want to call it,
[02:06:21.789 --> 02:06:22.709]  Patriot movement.
[02:06:25.091 --> 02:06:46.401]  And the only analogy I can give on that is, did you ever in high school have some girl you didn't like, who you weren't attracted to, who wanted you, and because you rebuffed her for several years, she then concocts some story about you?
[02:06:47.973 --> 02:06:52.096]  About how you, you know, wanted her and cornered her and did something to her.
[02:06:52.116 --> 02:06:55.679]  It like adds a... and then they're delusional, too.
[02:06:55.859 --> 02:06:57.581]  They then believe it.
[02:07:01.124 --> 02:07:03.406]  And, I mean, that's all I can say on the other thing.
[02:07:03.486 --> 02:07:11.032]  It's just like... I mean, I'm thinking about the World War III and our society and all the horrible things that are happening.
[02:07:12.393 --> 02:07:17.377]  And I just... I'm a man of my word and so I say I'm gonna do things
[02:07:18.758 --> 02:07:25.841]  You know, to defend myself against people who have gone after me, and then I just hate even being involved with them.
[02:07:25.981 --> 02:07:34.065]  I mean, I just wish that I didn't even know their names or who they were.
[02:07:34.105 --> 02:07:41.368]  It's just... It's like having to sit next to somebody on a bus who just has the worst body odor you can possibly imagine.
[02:07:41.388 --> 02:07:46.310]  One time I was on an airplane with this big, fat Russian guy who smelled like a septic tank.
[02:07:47.242 --> 02:07:48.803]  And it's kind of like that in my life.
[02:07:49.763 --> 02:07:52.105]  Frankly, I don't even want to be doing this, fighting the New World Order.
[02:07:52.165 --> 02:07:52.905]  I have to.
[02:07:53.686 --> 02:08:01.690]  Much less than have the non-fringe benefits of having to wallow around with the people that are involved in it, who
[02:08:03.326 --> 02:08:17.651]  Just have these incredible delusional ideas about things which you know are false but you know they're going to have to just see it through and then even after they're defeated they won't even know and they'll still believe their delusion.
[02:08:19.992 --> 02:08:21.393]  It's just disgusting.
[02:08:22.273 --> 02:08:30.476]  But I mean I've gotten to the point in my life where I just I just let it be you know that's just the way it is and I'm just resigned to so many things.
[02:08:32.051 --> 02:08:36.354]  But I gotta tell you, this eugenics stuff, I know it's got Aaron freaked out too.
[02:08:36.374 --> 02:08:42.037]  The way they talk about us, the things they say about us, the things they're doing.
[02:08:43.018 --> 02:08:47.981]  And you look at the general public, they can't even get themselves together enough to fight the New World Order.
[02:08:49.322 --> 02:08:50.522]  It's a bad situation.
[02:08:50.543 --> 02:08:51.143]  We'll come back.
[02:08:52.584 --> 02:08:55.866]  We've got a Mike, Jeff, Elmer, many others.
[02:08:58.607 --> 02:08:59.667]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:08:59.987 --> 02:09:02.768]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:09:03.028 --> 02:09:07.190]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:09:07.610 --> 02:09:08.450]  So what do you do?
[02:09:08.770 --> 02:09:13.312]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:09:13.812 --> 02:09:15.934]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:11:56.821 --> 02:11:59.522]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[02:11:59.802 --> 02:12:01.883]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[02:12:02.103 --> 02:12:04.624]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?

[02:12:09.546 --> 02:12:10.126]  Here's why.
[02:12:10.146 --> 02:12:16.789]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[02:12:17.069 --> 02:12:23.572]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.

[02:12:26.913 --> 02:12:27.413]  100% ethical.

[02:12:43.697 --> 02:12:44.597]  That's www.outand90.com.
[02:12:44.717 --> 02:12:45.217]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:12:45.438 --> 02:12:45.678]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:13:10.944 --> 02:13:31.646]  I guess the point I was making earlier just about the state of humankind is that it's a complex world so most people aren't involved in the complex world they just have their own little life and they stay focused on that that limited perspective
[02:13:33.456 --> 02:13:35.777]  And then years ago, I would just hate people.
[02:13:35.877 --> 02:13:37.418]  I'd hate the government, I'd hate others.
[02:13:37.478 --> 02:13:40.060]  And now, I don't even have that hate anymore.
[02:13:41.941 --> 02:13:46.183]  I mean, I guess it's kind of at the back of my mind, and in a way, hate would kind of warm you up.
[02:13:47.224 --> 02:13:50.366]  And I really feel sorry for my enemies and for your enemies.
[02:13:50.946 --> 02:13:53.607]  And it's also a disgust.
[02:13:53.687 --> 02:13:54.888]  It's worse than a hatred.
[02:13:55.729 --> 02:13:57.590]  It's like I just am revolted by it.
[02:13:59.153 --> 02:14:04.575]  Like, when I see Bush, I don't laugh at him anymore, or get angry at him, or yell liar at the television set.
[02:14:04.595 --> 02:14:05.876]  I just go, ugh.
[02:14:06.736 --> 02:14:18.920]  It's hard to watch, and I have to analyze it, and it's just... And I watch the Texas Legislature with all those crooks dressed up in fancy suits, and they all preen and try to act real manly, but they're all wearing fake shells, and they're real effeminate.
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:21.521]  That's not right to women, but you know what I mean.
[02:14:21.581 --> 02:14:24.042]  Men who are acting tough, it comes off as effeminate.
[02:14:24.442 --> 02:14:26.123]  And they're all preening like a bunch of
[02:14:27.597 --> 02:14:30.018]  Mindless peacocks, lemmings or something.
[02:14:30.798 --> 02:14:32.098]  And I don't even hate them.
[02:14:32.158 --> 02:14:34.559]  I'm just like, oh man, look at them.
[02:14:34.579 --> 02:14:37.160]  I don't understand it.
[02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:38.840]  And I mean, I'm not even that good of a person.
[02:14:38.860 --> 02:14:39.680]  I'm not perfect.
[02:14:40.781 --> 02:14:42.381]  But I'm just so sick of it all.
[02:14:43.161 --> 02:14:45.962]  And my discernment gets greater and greater, too.
[02:14:46.382 --> 02:14:51.363]  It's like, I'm almost, they say that with great knowledge comes sorrow.
[02:14:51.403 --> 02:14:54.464]  And I don't even claim to know that much, but compared to most people, I've got a lot of info.
[02:14:55.228 --> 02:15:00.212]  And just understanding of how things work, and I'm just... It's like, be careful what you ask for, folks.
[02:15:00.272 --> 02:15:06.716]  I always wanted great discernment, and I've got pretty darn good discernment, and it's just like, ugh.
[02:15:08.077 --> 02:15:08.998]  I'm tired of it.
[02:15:09.038 --> 02:15:10.779]  I'm tired of anticipating everything.
[02:15:10.819 --> 02:15:12.660]  I'm tired of knowing people's next move.
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:19.205]  I'm tired of having to just watch them con people, and watch the government get away with all the things they do.
[02:15:19.305 --> 02:15:22.247]  I just am... And, you know, I'm not always like this.
[02:15:22.287 --> 02:15:23.648]  I get buoyed from time to time.
[02:15:24.531 --> 02:15:30.214]  It's just, uh... I said I'd go through all the calls, and I am doing that, but not like I want to do.
[02:15:30.234 --> 02:15:30.974]  Let's try.
[02:15:32.114 --> 02:15:35.756]  Let's go to Mike and Jeff and Jack and Steve and Glenn and others.
[02:15:36.096 --> 02:15:37.317]  Mike in New Hampshire, go ahead.
[02:15:37.877 --> 02:15:39.097]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[02:15:39.478 --> 02:15:40.098]  Pretty good, sir.
[02:15:40.612 --> 02:15:40.852]  Good.
[02:15:41.132 --> 02:15:46.056]  I just wanted to call and let you know I'm Mike Jackman, the co-founder of Student Scholars for 9-11 Truth.
[02:15:46.436 --> 02:15:46.716]  Yes.
[02:15:47.217 --> 02:15:52.960]  And I was wondering if you had seen my friend Justin Martel's videos with Dennis Kucinich and Ron Fahl.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:53.841]  Yes, I've seen them.
[02:15:53.861 --> 02:15:54.602]  We've posted those.
[02:15:55.162 --> 02:16:01.566]  And I also want to let you know that we purchased a bullhorn a couple weeks ago on inspiration from you and all of your bullhorning.
[02:16:01.947 --> 02:16:02.907]  You have done well.
[02:16:03.708 --> 02:16:04.768]  We're looking forward to using it.
[02:16:06.479 --> 02:16:09.302]  We're having a screening of the movie Improbable Collapse.
[02:16:09.542 --> 02:16:15.687]  I go to Keene State College in Keene, New Hampshire, and the next couple of weeks we're going to be advertising for it.
[02:16:15.727 --> 02:16:19.310]  Probably going to be doing some bullhorning, and we'll get that on tape and send it to you.
[02:16:19.550 --> 02:16:20.230]  Good job!
[02:16:20.671 --> 02:16:27.676]  Yeah, so I was just wondering what your thoughts were on Ron Paul and Kucinich, and if you think that there's a legitimate chance that they might
[02:16:29.315 --> 02:16:32.276]  Go public further with their concern for the official story.
[02:16:32.616 --> 02:16:43.761]  Well, I think Ron Paul and Kucinich know that at this point, because of media demonization, it would be political seppuku for them to go completely public on 9-11.
[02:16:43.781 --> 02:16:51.785]  But Ron Paul has said he believes there's a cover-up on this show, and you can go read articles about it, and he said that he believes governments do stage provocations.
[02:16:52.725 --> 02:16:57.608]  And so he's gone further than any other major politician, except maybe somebody like Cynthia McKinney.
[02:16:58.829 --> 02:17:01.771]  And I know Kucinich has called for an investigation and said there's a cover-up.
[02:17:02.231 --> 02:17:04.772]  And that's pretty darn far for them to go, and we appreciate it.
[02:17:05.193 --> 02:17:05.713]  It really is.
[02:17:05.993 --> 02:17:14.158]  And I just want to tell you, I think Kucinich is going to go... He told me that his office has subpoena power, and they're looking into certain issues.
[02:17:14.198 --> 02:17:17.040]  He wouldn't tell me what the issues were, but he said that we're going to be hearing from him.
[02:17:18.126 --> 02:17:21.087]  I really hope that he does go forward with this.
[02:17:21.307 --> 02:17:33.110]  I think Kucinich is a genuine person, but I don't think he holds a candle to Ron Paul, because Ron Paul is a founding father grade, and Kucinich is more of a liberal socialist.
[02:17:33.630 --> 02:17:37.231]  But I mean, he means well, and he's done a lot of good stuff.
[02:17:37.751 --> 02:17:42.372]  Yeah, Ron Paul is what true Republicans should look at and support.
[02:17:42.392 --> 02:17:44.893]  You know, you've got these phony neocon Republicans,
[02:17:45.714 --> 02:17:53.722]  They're all just chills for the Bush Gang, but I went and saw Ron Paul a couple weeks ago here in New Hampshire, and there was about a crowd of 200 people.
[02:17:54.303 --> 02:17:59.568]  And honestly, he's the most pessimistic about his chances in a way, and he's doing this reluctantly, and that's what I really like.
[02:18:00.008 --> 02:18:02.511]  I like a leader who's someone who's called upon
[02:18:02.972 --> 02:18:03.392]  I don't think so.
[02:18:18.764 --> 02:18:43.026]  For personal power trip in the past when I believe in what I was doing I didn't like the globalist But it was fun to be a big shot, but when you really do become a big shot, and you're you're a moral person You start not liking the crowds you start not liking have making decisions you start not liking power and Ron Paul is certainly a statesman and Frankly does not like his job and does not like what he has to do, but he has to do it That's the type of leaders.
[02:18:43.066 --> 02:18:44.527]  We need we'll be right back.
[02:18:44.547 --> 02:18:44.587]  Oh
[02:18:47.453 --> 02:18:50.435]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:18:50.455 --> 02:18:54.137]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:04.024]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:19:04.264 --> 02:19:08.286]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:19:08.527 --> 02:19:10.688]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:19:11.048 --> 02:19:12.429]  All natural Non-X clears
[02:19:12.449 --> 02:19:13.809]  What about the source of the problem?
[02:19:14.069 --> 02:19:18.050]  The dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[02:19:18.370 --> 02:19:20.991]  Non-X nail gel is absolutely amazing!
[02:19:21.251 --> 02:19:24.772]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[02:19:25.032 --> 02:19:27.953]  Non-X nail gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[02:19:28.233 --> 02:19:32.894]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:19:33.294 --> 02:19:34.814]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:19:35.074 --> 02:19:38.495]  You'll find Non-X gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X
[02:19:38.975 --> 02:19:43.938]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:20:11.087 --> 02:20:11.567]  We're good.

[02:20:56.744 --> 02:20:58.246]  What is the secret of the sea?
[02:20:58.566 --> 02:21:04.213]  It's the exciting food from the sea and it can be yours with nature's original superfood from Wachter's.
[02:21:04.433 --> 02:21:11.101]  This excellent exclusive blend of Wachter's sea vegetation is bursting with over 65 trace minerals and vitamins.
[02:21:11.301 --> 02:21:16.507]  Our sea vegetation contains 40 times more nutrients than any land grown vegetation.
[02:21:16.687 --> 02:21:28.091]  You would need almost 20 pounds of alfalfa, 10 pounds of spirulina, and 40 pounds of wheat to get the same nutritional value found in only one pound of Wachter's exclusive blend of sea plants.
[02:21:28.351 --> 02:21:33.493]  Over 75 years of experience has made Wachter's the leader in sea vegetation nutrition.
[02:21:33.693 --> 02:21:34.753]  Experience the benefits!
[02:21:34.753 --> 02:21:34.993]  I think so.
[02:22:04.351 --> 02:22:12.620]  Getting back to the nature of political power, most people seek it because they're insecure or they like the raw exercise of it.
[02:22:13.981 --> 02:22:17.765]  And people revel in the trappings of success and the baubles.
[02:22:18.606 --> 02:22:20.268]  And to me, those are really chains.
[02:22:22.373 --> 02:22:43.702]  I mean success would be being an artist or a builder and having a big family and spending a lot of time with your family and being able to live a fulfilled life and seeing great things and traveling and a lot of people have that type of taste but still more in the modern Madison Avenue world where we're raised from cradle to grave
[02:22:44.406 --> 02:22:46.928]  Where it's just all about fake dominance.
[02:22:46.968 --> 02:22:53.934]  They even create little false structures and stratas where different subgroups of society can exercise petty power.
[02:22:54.714 --> 02:22:59.958]  The big sociologists now, of course, talk about the future with robotics and mechanized factories.
[02:22:59.978 --> 02:23:01.380]  There'll be more and more leisure time.
[02:23:01.660 --> 02:23:04.682]  That's why there's not a need for populations at this level.
[02:23:04.722 --> 02:23:09.766]  And they'll have to create petty systems just to give people the petty exercise of power.
[02:23:10.086 --> 02:23:11.768]  Or they'll revolt against the elite.
[02:23:12.395 --> 02:23:20.041]  And that's what the whole left-right paradigm is about, just while you have these petty wars that mean nothing because all the main horses are owned by the same mafia.
[02:23:22.844 --> 02:23:30.249]  But I have lost something as I've become a more loving, more well-rounded, more seasoned person.
[02:23:31.370 --> 02:23:41.799]  I can't imagine if I'm blessed to continue living what I'll be like in 5, 10, 20, 30 years, because I still have a lot of faults and a lot of problems, but I'm a better person than I was many years ago.
[02:23:42.634 --> 02:23:44.095]  But I do not have that.
[02:23:45.156 --> 02:23:54.944]  I have a drive to work harder than I ever worked before because I know the enemy knows the time is short and things are very serious and it's about survival and I've gotten myself very deep into this.
[02:23:56.105 --> 02:24:01.170]  But I don't have just that drive or that enjoyment of that quote competitiveness
[02:24:02.111 --> 02:24:04.972]  You know, with other patriots and other groups and other people.
[02:24:05.532 --> 02:24:23.537]  It's mainly a desire to build greater things, to wake up more people, and I still take a great pleasure from that, but I also have a lot of great disgust at just the... Because again, I don't have that high of a view of myself, and then I look at the general public.
[02:24:24.058 --> 02:24:24.838]  I'm just on average.
[02:24:26.644 --> 02:24:28.125]  They're completely ignorant.
[02:24:28.465 --> 02:24:30.506]  I don't want to say stupid, because they're not really dumb.
[02:24:30.526 --> 02:24:32.027]  They're just completely focused.
[02:24:32.647 --> 02:24:33.868]  They're under a spell.
[02:24:34.788 --> 02:24:38.650]  They're mesmerized by really a false reality.
[02:24:39.211 --> 02:24:49.556]  All the basic mathematical and semantical symbols that they've been given are twisted or are completely false or turned around backwards.
[02:24:49.576 --> 02:24:53.438]  It's what George Orwell in his frustration wrote about in 1948.
[02:24:55.566 --> 02:24:56.126]  When he published 1984.
[02:24:56.207 --> 02:25:04.532]  And Winston is basically himself in the book, and is trying to talk to people.
[02:25:05.653 --> 02:25:07.735]  What if he could get the general public to rise up?
[02:25:07.775 --> 02:25:08.295]  The proles?
[02:25:08.315 --> 02:25:09.836]  What if he could get them to see what they were doing?
[02:25:10.216 --> 02:25:12.358]  What if he could get them to realize the control around them?
[02:25:12.398 --> 02:25:20.584]  But he saw that they were basically like, not dumb animals, they were just following a pattern of their life.
[02:25:20.644 --> 02:25:22.445]  Playing the lottery, getting drunk,
[02:25:23.283 --> 02:25:31.986]  Acting tough, getting in petty fights, having little petty wars with their neighbors, never anything big or substantive, no wider horizons.
[02:25:34.307 --> 02:25:50.554]  I mean, I try to get you to capture this all the time, and I know many of you do better than I. I'm not on some high horse here, but every day I'm just struck, especially when I'm outside carrying out the trash or walking the dog, looking up at the moon and the stars, and we're on a planet.
[02:25:50.574 --> 02:25:51.674]  We're on a planet!
[02:25:52.210 --> 02:26:20.366]  That orbits a big burning ball of gas with a moon and again the trees and the bugs and the life and just all the amazing things that are around us and your children and your wives and husbands and grandmothers and the good food we eat and just all the beauty and the blessings and you've got a bunch of unhappy people who aren't satisfied and see I am satisfied!
[02:26:22.825 --> 02:26:27.729]  I'm extremely satisfied, and I don't understand how people are not satisfied.
[02:26:29.070 --> 02:26:47.325]  I don't understand how they just have been made to feel inadequate, and then these mindless biological machines basically being programmed by television, and then the culture around you regurgitates that culture and only magnifies it at the animal level.
[02:26:48.967 --> 02:26:49.287]  I don't know.
[02:26:49.327 --> 02:26:51.709]  I don't want to get all philosophical here and then get into the whole
[02:26:52.626 --> 02:26:53.626]  Mechanics of things.
[02:26:53.646 --> 02:26:56.627]  I just... Good Lord!
[02:26:57.167 --> 02:26:59.268]  Look at what we've been conditioned to accept!
[02:26:59.288 --> 02:27:12.232]  I mean, I talk about it all the time, but I mean, it's been in major newspapers that Dyncor and Halliburton run giant kidnapping rings of whole groups of women and children in the hundreds of thousands.
[02:27:12.252 --> 02:27:14.693]  I mean, what?
[02:27:15.173 --> 02:27:20.415]  There is an instant arrest and freak-outs and trillions missing from the Pentagon and no one goes to jail?
[02:27:20.455 --> 02:27:21.495]  There's no investigation?
[02:27:22.361 --> 02:27:24.702]  The Pentagon tells Congress they're not going to answer their questions?
[02:27:25.362 --> 02:27:28.823]  Talk show hosts are everywhere talking about putting us patriots in FEMA camps?
[02:27:32.323 --> 02:27:33.184]  Can we just sit here?
[02:27:34.124 --> 02:27:36.444]  We just sit here and it all goes on around us?
[02:27:36.504 --> 02:27:38.305]  I mean, how could you not see it?
[02:27:38.345 --> 02:27:39.645]  How could it not be obvious?
[02:27:42.506 --> 02:27:44.526]  Alright, let's blast through your calls as I said I would do.
[02:27:46.367 --> 02:27:47.787]  Jeff in Oklahoma, thanks for holding.
[02:27:48.237 --> 02:27:49.958]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:27:49.998 --> 02:27:51.278]  This is the second time I've called.
[02:27:51.298 --> 02:27:52.038]  Thanks for calling.
[02:27:52.438 --> 02:27:52.818]  Alright.
[02:27:53.819 --> 02:28:00.161]  I don't get a chance to really listen to your show because I work like 80 hours a week and I sleep during the day.
[02:28:00.901 --> 02:28:03.422]  But I've had a chance to listen to it a little bit today.
[02:28:03.442 --> 02:28:10.864]  I'd like to say that I did get the video America from Aaron Russo.
[02:28:10.884 --> 02:28:16.726]  I got to watch it plenty of times and I was pretty shocked to find out
[02:28:17.492 --> 02:28:19.053]  What the IRS has been doing.
[02:28:19.694 --> 02:28:22.396]  The immense fraud of the income tax.
[02:28:24.938 --> 02:28:27.500]  I guess Aaron Russo said that it's more like a protection racket.
[02:28:27.780 --> 02:28:30.122]  We ought to write a book called Planet Hoax.
[02:28:30.962 --> 02:28:31.563]  Planet Hoax?
[02:28:31.763 --> 02:28:33.244]  Just everything's a hoax, yeah.
[02:28:33.604 --> 02:28:35.106]  Yeah.
[02:28:35.886 --> 02:28:42.792]  And the people he interviewed, I got to look them up on the web and read some of their comments.
[02:28:42.852 --> 02:28:46.835]  Jennifer Long, Sherry Jackson, Joe Bannister has his own website too.
[02:28:48.173 --> 02:28:56.159]  Uh... She, uh, Sherry Jackson also has a video thing called Breaking the Invisible Shackles of the IRS.
[02:28:56.219 --> 02:28:57.300]  It's on Google Video.
[02:28:58.101 --> 02:29:00.042]  You just type in her name and it'll pop up.
[02:29:02.124 --> 02:29:10.370]  Oh yeah, there's a whole bunch of IRS agents and armed treasury agents that have gone public and then the IRS has come after them criminally and they've won in court against the IRS.
[02:29:10.731 --> 02:29:10.931]  Yeah.
[02:29:11.551 --> 02:29:16.175]  And, uh, they also had a guy called Erwin Schiff who, uh... He's gone to prison.
[02:29:16.635 --> 02:29:16.895]  Yeah.
[02:29:18.553 --> 02:29:20.293]  Now, he got railroaded.
[02:29:20.834 --> 02:29:24.534]  The judge wouldn't let him... The judge said, I will not have the law on my court.
[02:29:24.814 --> 02:29:25.214]  That's right.
[02:29:25.234 --> 02:29:25.855]  That's a quote.
[02:29:26.315 --> 02:29:35.457]  He would not let Erwin bring in Supreme Court rulings that were pretty evident for his defense.
[02:29:36.097 --> 02:29:41.338]  He wouldn't allow him to bring in certain people as witnesses.
[02:29:43.178 --> 02:29:45.639]  And they put a government ban on his book.
[02:29:46.465 --> 02:29:49.406]  Which now we can download for free off his website, which I did.
[02:29:49.426 --> 02:29:52.166]  I think he called it the Federal Mafia.
[02:29:52.587 --> 02:29:53.267]  That's what it is.
[02:29:53.287 --> 02:29:55.027]  Yeah.
[02:29:55.047 --> 02:30:13.232]  And I think briefly on it, it says how you can get your employer to not withhold taxes from your paycheck and something about the zero
[02:30:14.139 --> 02:30:15.699]  Yeah, finally a zero return.
[02:30:16.239 --> 02:30:17.440]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:30:17.460 --> 02:30:18.460]  I'm going to comment on that.
[02:30:19.340 --> 02:30:21.341]  I like what Aaron Russo says on the subject.
[02:30:22.141 --> 02:30:22.881]  It is a fraud.
[02:30:22.901 --> 02:30:23.581]  It is a scam.
[02:30:23.641 --> 02:30:25.782]  It's paid directly to the Federal Reserve.
[02:30:25.862 --> 02:30:27.442]  It does not run anything in the country.
[02:30:28.642 --> 02:30:29.883]  There's hundreds of other taxes.
[02:30:31.363 --> 02:30:33.863]  But I'm not telling you not to pay the taxes.
[02:30:36.004 --> 02:30:37.044]  That's up to you to do.
[02:30:37.464 --> 02:30:37.904]  I pay them.
[02:30:38.865 --> 02:30:40.445]  Because they are the mafia.
[02:30:41.178 --> 02:30:48.004]  And with a lot of people, they do come after you, and they do railroad you, and it doesn't matter if there's no law, they send you to prison.
[02:30:49.486 --> 02:30:55.030]  So, if the Mafia tells you to pay them money, I'm not telling you what to do or what not to do.
[02:30:55.091 --> 02:30:55.831]  That's up to you.
[02:30:57.192 --> 02:30:57.973]  It is a fraud.
[02:30:58.073 --> 02:30:58.914]  It is a scam.
[02:30:59.675 --> 02:31:00.876]  Now, I've chosen my battles.
[02:31:01.016 --> 02:31:04.279]  I could decide to be the big tax crusader.
[02:31:06.860 --> 02:31:08.281]  And I have had a lot of these guests on.
[02:31:08.321 --> 02:31:09.221]  I've made a film about it.
[02:31:09.861 --> 02:31:15.323]  Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports exposed as the first videotaped interview with Joe Bannister in it.
[02:31:16.244 --> 02:31:17.144]  We have exposed it.
[02:31:18.044 --> 02:31:22.886]  We talk about it, but I choose my battles because once you get in a fight with the IRS, man, it takes all your time out.
[02:31:22.906 --> 02:31:27.008]  I mean, you're now fighting the government who has unlimited resources.
[02:31:28.628 --> 02:31:31.369]  And so you have to choose your battles wisely.
[02:31:31.469 --> 02:31:34.951]  And I've chosen to sit here and expose the system, but then to
[02:31:36.375 --> 02:31:39.597]  Not sit here and advise everybody to not go pay it.
[02:31:41.257 --> 02:31:43.438]  People say, well, it'll shut down if you don't pay it.
[02:31:43.558 --> 02:31:44.239]  No, no, no, no.
[02:31:44.279 --> 02:31:45.959]  It's a tool of control over you folks.
[02:31:46.039 --> 02:31:47.060]  It doesn't matter.
[02:31:47.080 --> 02:31:49.661]  It doesn't hurt the globalists when you don't pay the tax, okay?
[02:31:49.821 --> 02:31:52.022]  Just so you know, they issued the money out of nothing to begin with.
[02:31:54.204 --> 02:31:57.186]  It's really an inflationary control mechanism, but it is a fraud.
[02:31:57.206 --> 02:31:59.187]  That's why we carry American Freedom to Fascism.
[02:31:59.507 --> 02:32:00.648]  But it covers more than just that.
[02:32:00.688 --> 02:32:02.750]  It covers who owns it, who runs it, the Federal Reserve.
[02:32:03.150 --> 02:32:04.291]  It covers the North American Union.
[02:32:04.311 --> 02:32:10.635]  It's a very important film available at Infowars.com by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:32:10.655 --> 02:32:15.117]  You know, I don't normally have time to describe all the stuff that's in these films.
[02:32:15.137 --> 02:32:16.138]  These are excellent videos.
[02:32:17.019 --> 02:32:18.520]  And you need to get the videos we carry.
[02:32:18.540 --> 02:32:21.682]  I mean, I could spend an hour on each one just talking about the basics that's in them.
[02:32:22.082 --> 02:32:23.623]  The films I've made, the films I carry.
[02:32:24.524 --> 02:32:27.266]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jack in Kansas City.
[02:32:27.306 --> 02:32:27.946]  Jack, go ahead.
[02:32:27.966 --> 02:32:29.247]  Hi, Alex.
[02:32:29.627 --> 02:32:29.907]  Hello.
[02:32:30.808 --> 02:32:37.012]  I just wanted to see if you knew anything about the recent stock plunge and if it had anything to do with economic collapse.
[02:32:38.433 --> 02:32:49.039]  Well, it just shows continued volatility in the market, and it shows how fast things can change in the global markets, not just the markets here in Chicago or New York.
[02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:53.862]  But, yeah, the thing is a fraud to begin with.
[02:32:54.432 --> 02:33:04.959]  The Dow Industrial 30 is only winners, and it itself is at half its value pre-2000 because of the currency inflation.
[02:33:04.979 --> 02:33:11.024]  Yeah, I thought it was pretty interesting that you were talking about one day about 9-11 insider trading.
[02:33:14.586 --> 02:33:18.449]  Could you actually predict what's going to happen by looking at the stock market and what it's doing?
[02:33:20.021 --> 02:33:21.582]  It's a huge complex system.
[02:33:21.622 --> 02:33:25.926]  The government and others have huge programs, computer programs, trying to track it and watch it.
[02:33:27.407 --> 02:33:38.416]  I can just cover the fact that it is very speculative, very volatile, very dangerous, and the simple maxim of diversification is the answer.
[02:33:38.836 --> 02:33:45.222]  The stock market has been growing by a few percentage points a year in the last six, seven years.
[02:33:46.653 --> 02:33:49.755]  And that's with currency inflation, and look at what gold's done.
[02:33:50.436 --> 02:33:53.517]  It's way outperformed it, but I'm not saying just be in gold.
[02:33:54.018 --> 02:33:55.178]  You should be diversified.
[02:33:56.839 --> 02:33:57.780]  Can I plug my website?
[02:33:58.300 --> 02:33:59.081]  Sure, plug away.
[02:33:59.741 --> 02:34:01.762]  It's evolutionofdeception.com.
[02:34:02.123 --> 02:34:02.683]  It's a good name.
[02:34:03.283 --> 02:34:07.906]  I'd like to get on your shows sometime as a guest because I want to do a radio talk show.
[02:34:09.006 --> 02:34:14.269]  Well, what you need to do to do that is you need to start doing your own podcast.
[02:34:14.830 --> 02:34:16.931]  Buy the microphone, buy a little mixing board.
[02:34:16.951 --> 02:34:20.273]  If you don't know how, get a computer guy over to show you, get your neighbor to show you.
[02:34:20.654 --> 02:34:29.839]  Start uploading your podcast to one of the many podcast websites that are out there, and so you'll have some tapes to show people that you can do a radio show.
[02:34:29.859 --> 02:34:31.120]  But you can probably do a great one.
[02:34:31.160 --> 02:34:33.762]  I'm just telling you, you've got to start with something first before you
[02:34:34.322 --> 02:34:38.105]  Kind of graduating the mid-level like this network, but but thank you for the call.
[02:34:38.606 --> 02:34:42.389]  That's one of the things I want to do is Whenever we get around to it.
[02:34:42.429 --> 02:34:51.956]  I'm too busy Flushing money down a rat hole suing people because I have to I'm too busy trying to make a film.
[02:34:51.996 --> 02:35:00.423]  I'm too busy doing the radio show and interviews I've actually suspended doing interviews for a while turned down a whole bunch because I've just got to focus on this film and
[02:35:02.643 --> 02:35:04.485]  How did I get off into that discussion just now?
[02:35:04.765 --> 02:35:05.125]  Oh, yeah!
[02:35:05.145 --> 02:35:06.747]  I'm going to have a big website.
[02:35:06.767 --> 02:35:08.008]  It's going to be like MySpace.
[02:35:08.128 --> 02:35:10.510]  It's also going to have video uploads, audio uploads.
[02:35:11.451 --> 02:35:17.376]  You'll have your own area of your own site where you can also post your own video and audio, but on the same platform.
[02:35:19.698 --> 02:35:23.561]  And it's a major investment of most of the capital I have to do it, but I am doing it.
[02:35:23.821 --> 02:35:27.124]  And I'm doing it because it's going to be about user content.
[02:35:28.112 --> 02:35:34.937]  And it's going to be about turning you loose and then I'm going to sit there with all my energy and promote the site to help bring in viewers and listeners.
[02:35:34.977 --> 02:35:35.818]  You can do the same.
[02:35:35.978 --> 02:35:38.260]  It's going to be, I'm really excited about it.
[02:35:39.901 --> 02:35:43.264]  Because everything I do is about what is the most effective to reach the people.
[02:35:43.324 --> 02:35:45.846]  What is the most effective way to warn them?
[02:35:45.906 --> 02:35:47.187]  And it's film and internet.
[02:35:48.268 --> 02:35:51.190]  And so a major evolution in what we do.
[02:35:51.210 --> 02:35:57.075]  And that's why I just get so disgusted by all the other things I have to do because it's just
[02:35:58.391 --> 02:36:02.614]  It's just, if I say I'm going to do something, I have to do it, and I have to do it one step at a time.
[02:36:03.254 --> 02:36:06.036]  And I've just got so many things I want to do.
[02:36:06.076 --> 02:36:09.779]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steven Mass.
[02:36:09.839 --> 02:36:10.719]  Steve, you're on the air.
[02:36:10.739 --> 02:36:11.920]  Hey Alex, what's up?
[02:36:12.621 --> 02:36:13.881]  Doing a worldwide radio show.
[02:36:13.901 --> 02:36:14.442]  What's up with you?
[02:36:14.462 --> 02:36:15.262]  How you doing, buddy?
[02:36:15.483 --> 02:36:19.525]  The thing I want to tell you, it's not just what we were just saying about the news out there.
[02:36:19.665 --> 02:36:22.567]  It's not just the media and stuff like that, or tapes.
[02:36:23.108 --> 02:36:24.248]  What it is, it's money.
[02:36:24.869 --> 02:36:27.671]  Alex, I want everybody to take out their dollar bills, their 20s,
[02:36:28.647 --> 02:36:31.428]  50s, 100s, I want them to write across it, right across the C&I.
[02:36:32.009 --> 02:36:34.590]  I want them to write, uh, 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:36:36.091 --> 02:36:39.192]  Infowars.com, or whatever message they have else to write.
[02:36:39.973 --> 02:36:46.956]  Start using the money, start writing on it, start putting anything you want on it to get people to look at it, to say, hey, what's this, and look it up.
[02:36:47.540 --> 02:36:48.880]  By making people more aware.
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:50.721]  Well, that is very effective.
[02:36:50.761 --> 02:36:55.482]  I can't tell you how much, and I'm not talking about the $20 bills that are sent here for videos.
[02:36:55.862 --> 02:37:04.704]  I mean, I'll be at 7-Eleven getting change for gasoline, and it'll be Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com on the Money or Other Truth websites.
[02:37:04.764 --> 02:37:05.724]  It's very exciting.
[02:37:06.104 --> 02:37:07.585]  I want to see, I'd like to see more of that.
[02:37:07.745 --> 02:37:11.586]  Another thing I want to say is that I'm a veteran, a Vietnam veteran.
[02:37:12.266 --> 02:37:16.467]  I can basically say that this whole new world order from the beginning ruined my life.
[02:37:18.764 --> 02:37:19.605]  I have no children.
[02:37:19.665 --> 02:37:27.046]  I really can't have the kind of life that I wanted to have because of a dirty, bloody war that I fought.
[02:37:27.247 --> 02:37:30.647]  I will fight for you, your children, and your children's children.
[02:37:30.767 --> 02:37:31.588]  Thank you, my brother.
[02:37:31.968 --> 02:37:35.729]  And one more thing is that they think this new world order thing is going to be easy for them.
[02:37:35.789 --> 02:37:36.729]  It's not going to be easy, Alex.
[02:37:38.140 --> 02:37:38.920]  It's not going to be easy.
[02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:40.301]  There's a lot of veterans out there.
[02:37:40.401 --> 02:37:46.403]  No, they know that, but they're going to make a whole industry out of fighting us and then profit themselves, but it's going to be worse than they even think.
[02:37:46.603 --> 02:37:46.963]  Oh, it is.
[02:37:47.424 --> 02:37:47.864]  It will be.
[02:37:48.264 --> 02:37:52.946]  I've got a lot of brothers out there who I talk to, Vietnam vets and people like that, and we're already talking.
[02:37:53.186 --> 02:37:54.827]  I mean, it ain't going to be easy for them.
[02:37:55.087 --> 02:37:55.867]  It's not going to be easy.
[02:37:56.067 --> 02:37:57.948]  It won't be easy for us, but it's not going to be easy for them.
[02:37:57.968 --> 02:37:58.768]  That's for damn sure.
[02:37:59.708 --> 02:38:03.670]  Well, I know these talk show hosts say, I need to go to a FEMA camp, and my listeners do.
[02:38:04.110 --> 02:38:05.291]  They're enemies of America.
[02:38:06.678 --> 02:38:16.125]  They're going to be held accountable for what they've done when we take this Republic back because that's treason against the Bill of Rights and the Constitution to get on the radio and say put everybody in camps.
[02:38:16.185 --> 02:38:17.526]  The Nazis didn't even do that.
[02:38:17.807 --> 02:38:18.827]  They were quiet about it.
[02:38:19.067 --> 02:38:23.811]  These bastards, these un-American pieces of filth get on air and say that.
[02:38:24.752 --> 02:38:26.053]  I would never end up in a FEMA camp.
[02:38:26.313 --> 02:38:28.495]  No way would I end up in a FEMA camp.
[02:38:29.055 --> 02:38:31.557]  I didn't end up in concentration camps in Vietnam.
[02:38:31.637 --> 02:38:32.277]  I know how to fight.
[02:38:32.378 --> 02:38:32.878]  I survived.
[02:38:33.348 --> 02:38:39.549]  And I talk to all my brothers out there who fought in wars and want to be able to adapt, improvise, and overcome.
[02:38:40.970 --> 02:38:44.030]  We are adapting, we are improvising, we are overcoming.
[02:38:44.430 --> 02:38:46.111]  We're having victory after victory.
[02:38:46.311 --> 02:38:48.811]  It still doesn't make it fun as we're... No.
[02:38:49.191 --> 02:38:55.953]  And I know it's a lot of responsibility on you, and it's time for us Americans to pick up the slack and start doing something.
[02:38:56.473 --> 02:39:00.034]  We all got to get together and start doing something and help you with this.
[02:39:00.454 --> 02:39:01.314]  I know like Ron Paul,
[02:39:02.529 --> 02:39:03.270]  He's coming forward.
[02:39:03.290 --> 02:39:04.291]  He really doesn't want to do it.
[02:39:04.651 --> 02:39:08.494]  You're doing things that you really don't want to do, but you have to do it because you're an American and you're a true patriot.
[02:39:09.375 --> 02:39:11.217]  Well, I'm just trying to survive just like you.
[02:39:11.417 --> 02:39:12.017]  Yeah, right.
[02:39:12.257 --> 02:39:17.302]  We've got an elite who are totally evil, admitting they're evil, doing all these bad things.
[02:39:17.362 --> 02:39:18.243]  We've got to fight them.
[02:39:18.263 --> 02:39:19.384]  We can't just give in to them.
[02:39:19.404 --> 02:39:19.924]  No, we can't.
[02:39:20.044 --> 02:39:20.465]  We can't.
[02:39:20.725 --> 02:39:22.226]  I mean, it comes down to this.
[02:39:22.286 --> 02:39:23.047]  We have to fight.
[02:39:23.387 --> 02:39:25.469]  We have to fight, and we have to fight for your children.
[02:39:27.583 --> 02:39:36.467]  Well, I appreciate you fighting for all the widows and the orphans and all the people, and they are your children, even though they're not your children by blood, my friend.
[02:39:36.848 --> 02:39:43.751]  It is men's job to be the fathers of society, to be the warriors, and to stand on the front line against the tyranny of evil men.
[02:39:44.211 --> 02:39:45.412]  So I salute you, my friend.
[02:39:45.452 --> 02:39:46.313]  We appreciate you.
[02:39:46.773 --> 02:39:49.334]  Final segment, a couple news items, and your calls.
[02:39:49.834 --> 02:39:50.415]  Stay with us.

[02:40:59.571 --> 02:41:05.060]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:41:05.420 --> 02:41:13.012]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:41:13.740 --> 02:41:20.803]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:41:21.203 --> 02:41:32.668]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:41:32.928 --> 02:41:36.850]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:41:36.870 --> 02:41:38.791]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:41:39.151 --> 02:41:42.993]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:43:05.175 --> 02:43:09.340]  You're all personal, Jesus
[02:43:23.928 --> 02:43:25.050]  Welcome back.
[02:43:25.090 --> 02:43:26.713]  I'll be back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:43:26.733 --> 02:43:27.173]  Central.
[02:43:28.656 --> 02:43:29.637]  TheInfoWars.com.
[02:43:29.677 --> 02:43:32.983]  We're an affiliate near you, emanating out of the studios of NewsRadio 590, KLBJ.
[02:43:36.383 --> 02:43:44.110]  Inmates may cut time by donating organs, and they've been really lobbying to take people that kills organs, and then that sets the precedent like China to do it.
[02:43:44.551 --> 02:43:46.493]  But now, oh, give your organs you get out.
[02:43:46.533 --> 02:43:47.674]  This is getting really sick.
[02:43:48.174 --> 02:43:53.659]  Lawmakers are considering legislation that would let prisoners donate organs or bone marrow in exchange for time off their sentences.
[02:43:53.719 --> 02:43:58.384]  A state Senate panel on Thursday endorsed creating an organ and tissue donation program for inmates.
[02:43:59.128 --> 02:44:00.028]  Right here in Texas.
[02:44:00.048 --> 02:44:01.008]  This is disgusting.
[02:44:01.389 --> 02:44:08.130]  But legislators postponed a measure to reduce the sentences of participating prisoners citing a concern that federal law may not allow it.
[02:44:08.830 --> 02:44:10.050]  This is really creepy.
[02:44:10.490 --> 02:44:10.931]  Look at this.
[02:44:11.251 --> 02:44:12.131]  UK Daily Mail.
[02:44:12.191 --> 02:44:13.691]  The rice with human genes.
[02:44:13.731 --> 02:44:14.811]  The first GM crop.
[02:44:14.871 --> 02:44:15.312]  Not true.
[02:44:15.332 --> 02:44:18.712]  Containing human genes is set to be approved for commercial production.
[02:44:19.512 --> 02:44:24.534]  The laboratory created rice produces some of the human proteins found in breast milk and saliva.
[02:44:24.954 --> 02:44:26.614]  Now they want to put vaccines in the food.
[02:44:27.967 --> 02:44:37.030]  Also, celebration ban for Jamestown's 400th anniversary of the Jamestown Colony, saying it's evil and hateful and an invasion, and it's been banned celebrating it.
[02:44:37.110 --> 02:44:39.511]  Again, political correctness, nothing but control.
[02:44:39.591 --> 02:44:47.333]  France bans citizen journals from videotaping violence, saying only approved media is allowed to film what's happening on the streets, but Big Brother's gonna watch you.
[02:44:48.033 --> 02:44:50.694]  Let's jam in three calls here quickly, giving each one of you a minute.
[02:44:50.754 --> 02:44:52.615]  Glenn in New Jersey, then John and Brian.
[02:44:52.855 --> 02:44:53.915]  Go ahead, Glenn, you're on the air.
[02:44:56.309 --> 02:44:57.109]  Glenn just dropped.
[02:44:57.169 --> 02:44:58.029]  John in Oklahoma.
[02:44:58.069 --> 02:44:58.329]  Go ahead.
[02:44:58.349 --> 02:44:58.870]  You're on the air.
[02:44:58.890 --> 02:45:00.730]  Hey, Alex.
[02:45:00.750 --> 02:45:01.310]  How's it going?
[02:45:01.370 --> 02:45:01.730]  Good, sir.
[02:45:02.750 --> 02:45:03.871]  That's good.
[02:45:04.131 --> 02:45:08.712]  I just got done watching Martial Law, and that is an amazing film.
[02:45:09.172 --> 02:45:10.072]  Three hours long.
[02:45:10.132 --> 02:45:11.592]  Thanks for watching.
[02:45:12.192 --> 02:45:21.795]  Yeah, it took two days to watch because I started before I had to go to work, but once I got off work, I went straight home and got on to watching that.
[02:45:22.195 --> 02:45:23.495]  Well, thank you for seeing the film.
[02:45:24.361 --> 02:45:31.563]  Yeah, and I just, you've kind of opened up, like, not my eyes, but my parents' eyes.
[02:45:32.583 --> 02:45:33.003]  Oh, really?
[02:45:33.023 --> 02:45:34.164]  So you showed it to them?
[02:45:34.704 --> 02:45:36.764]  Yeah, I told them that they had to watch it.
[02:45:37.645 --> 02:45:42.246]  Because, like, I've been telling them that I thought 9-11 was an inside job for years.
[02:45:43.439 --> 02:45:47.102]  They just said, no, no, why would the government do that?
[02:45:47.262 --> 02:45:51.425]  And I was just like, you're blind to the reason that you don't want to believe that the government can do that.
[02:45:51.505 --> 02:45:53.747]  So, so briefly, and I'm glad to hear this.
[02:45:53.787 --> 02:45:55.308]  I'll always love to hear these good reports.
[02:45:55.608 --> 02:45:56.949]  What did they say after they'd seen it?
[02:45:57.750 --> 02:46:10.039]  After I showed my dad, he just, he was in complete shock and he was so glad that he had seen that film because now he knows what the government's actually about and not, you know, that,
[02:46:10.504 --> 02:46:15.826]  Sugar-coatedness that everyone gets to see from you know the propaganda that they send out.
[02:46:15.886 --> 02:46:17.507]  Sure, what part do you think was most shocking?
[02:46:19.368 --> 02:46:33.173]  Probably whenever he saw the evidence with you know all the engineers saying that there's no way that those towers could have fallen the way that they did and you know after he heard the firefighters
[02:46:34.262 --> 02:46:38.964]  Good to hear from you.
[02:46:38.984 --> 02:46:43.245]  Call me back later if you want to talk more.
[02:46:43.526 --> 02:46:44.466]  Brian in Maryland.
[02:46:44.486 --> 02:46:45.386]  You're our tail gunner.
[02:46:45.766 --> 02:46:46.247]  Go ahead.
[02:46:47.027 --> 02:46:50.008]  Hey Alex, this is Brian with bc911truth.org.
[02:46:50.068 --> 02:46:50.628]  How you doing?
[02:46:50.728 --> 02:46:51.028]  Good.
[02:46:51.849 --> 02:46:59.251]  Hey, I want everybody to know that we do demonstrate in front of the White House every Saturday from 1 to 2 o'clock.
[02:46:59.551 --> 02:46:59.932]  Good.
[02:47:00.112 --> 02:47:01.032]  Everybody's welcome.
[02:47:01.915 --> 02:47:03.796]  Uh, to demonstrate for 9-11 Truth.
[02:47:05.057 --> 02:47:11.981]  Um, also Alex, I'd like to, uh, let you guys know that we, uh, started a new website in conjunction with Webster Tarpley.
[02:47:13.001 --> 02:47:16.103]  And that website is 9-11TruthSquad.org.
[02:47:16.623 --> 02:47:17.304]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[02:47:17.344 --> 02:47:18.244]  What else is going on?
[02:47:19.485 --> 02:47:24.007]  Uh, we're just fighting the fight and keeping up with, uh, what's going on out there.
[02:47:24.047 --> 02:47:27.109]  But, you know something, we're in a fight for our lives, Alex.
[02:47:27.699 --> 02:47:30.723]  And people need to get active or get radioactive.
[02:47:31.424 --> 02:47:31.865]  We are.
[02:47:31.965 --> 02:47:33.087]  Listen, I got your six.
[02:47:33.127 --> 02:47:34.028]  God bless you all.
[02:47:34.088 --> 02:47:34.569]  Take care.
