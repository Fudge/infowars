[00:00:05.746 --> 00:00:09.968]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.588 --> 00:00:11.408]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:13.109]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:17.531]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:21.992]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.161]  No, we fooled you again.
[00:00:28.181 --> 00:00:30.002]  It's live from Austin, Texas.
[00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:39.928]  This is Bob Dacey, once again, substituting for Alex Jones, who is still on an extended long weekend vacation, which he thoroughly deserves.
[00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.792]  So, as I promised on Friday, I'm back here Monday, and I will be back here tomorrow, too.
[00:00:45.932 --> 00:00:53.457]  And while I'm thinking about it, tomorrow's guest is going to be the president of the John Birch Society.
[00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:55.044]  John McManus.
[00:00:55.084 --> 00:00:57.265]  He's going to come in on the second hour tomorrow.
[00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.547]  So you sure want to stay tuned for that.
[00:01:01.587 --> 00:01:02.607]  But that's going to be tomorrow.
[00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:18.713]  Today, well, Alex communicated with me the other day that he would appreciate it if I take one of these days and use it to bash the United Nations and the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:01:19.914 --> 00:01:21.154]  I'm kind of locally known here.
[00:01:21.174 --> 00:01:23.495]  I have a TV show here in Austin called The Simple Truth.
[00:01:24.224 --> 00:01:38.312]  It's been on the air for over eight years and I am well known in Austin for my ability to bash the United Nations and the CFR too, while we're at it, because the CFR is what created the United Nations.
[00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:43.334]  But that's what we're going to be doing pretty much all day long today.
[00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:49.618]  I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to bash them as thoroughly as I can, as factually as I can.
[00:01:50.709 --> 00:02:18.818]  And if you are new to the subject of why anyone would dare oppose the United Nations and their light blue warm color with the little white wheat stalks and the little global thing and their warm fuzzy appearance, the light baby blue, why would anybody want to bash a peace organization that's for world peace and harmony and brotherhood?
[00:02:19.602 --> 00:02:21.003]  And the rights of man?
[00:02:21.363 --> 00:02:35.473]  Well, if you're new to this, stay tuned to the Alex Jones Show today, and you're going to find out why someone would oppose the United Nations as much as I do, of course, as much as Alex does.
[00:02:35.894 --> 00:02:44.720]  Actually, when I get done today, if you don't oppose the United Nations, after you check out what I say, of course, to be all factual, which it will be,
[00:02:46.308 --> 00:02:49.150]  You are a communist, okay?
[00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.511]  You're a totalitarian.
[00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:58.736]  You believe that the communitarian way of governing man is the right way to go.
[00:02:58.856 --> 00:03:01.338]  You do not believe in individual liberty.
[00:03:01.378 --> 00:03:05.101]  You do not believe in individual human rights.
[00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:08.703]  You do not believe in the Bill of Rights.
[00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:12.205]  You do not believe in the Constitution of the United States of America.
[00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:13.446]  You do not believe
[00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:18.360]  In our way of government, okay?
[00:03:18.601 --> 00:03:27.546]  If by the end of today, what I've done, you still like the United Nations, well, I guess you have a right to now.
[00:03:29.107 --> 00:03:35.250]  However, if they were able to take over this whole country, this whole world, you wouldn't have a right to do anything they didn't want you to do.
[00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:36.911]  So that's what we're going to do.
[00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:46.230]  Today, we're going to bash the UN and the entity that created it, the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:58.599]  Again, I host a TV show here in Austin called The Simple Truth, and currently, for those of you in the Austin area, it's on Time Warner Cable Access TV.
[00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:06.985]  Tonight, I've got a busy day today, tonight from 6 to 7, and we're going to do a very special program.
[00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:07.786]  We're going to re-air
[00:04:08.544 --> 00:04:09.125]  We're good to go.
[00:04:37.552 --> 00:04:38.632]  And you'll be able to see it.
[00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:42.474]  It's quite an earth-chattering revelation.
[00:04:43.234 --> 00:04:44.914]  So, anyway, that's what we're going to be doing.
[00:04:45.294 --> 00:04:49.136]  And when we get back, we're going to start our UN Bash-a-thon.
[00:04:49.216 --> 00:04:52.336]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:05:01.773 --> 00:05:06.997]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:05:07.157 --> 00:05:15.243]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:05:15.503 --> 00:05:22.548]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:23.648]  We're good to go!
[00:05:49.913 --> 00:05:50.393]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:50.413 --> 00:05:51.114]  A new world order.
[00:05:51.314 --> 00:05:54.616]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:54.636 --> 00:05:56.337]  It's known as the Builder-Birds.
[00:05:56.558 --> 00:05:58.599]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:00.260]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:19.594 --> 00:06:26.929]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:34.952]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:35.413 --> 00:06:38.875]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:39.255 --> 00:06:41.777]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:41.817 --> 00:06:42.978]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:43.018 --> 00:06:43.718]  They're not after money.
[00:06:43.758 --> 00:06:44.839]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:45.820]  They're after power.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.060]  That's what they have to do.
[00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:55.386]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.526 --> 00:06:58.348]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:58.708 --> 00:06:59.769]  You have been warned.
[00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:08.196]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry, and I'm a plastic surgeon, and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[00:07:08.357 --> 00:07:10.859]  But I want to tell you today about a product that I developed.
[00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:17.084]  It's called Night Skin, and it helps your skin look younger without needles, without acid peels, and without a facelift.
[00:07:17.305 --> 00:07:20.447]  In 12 hours, it will make your skin seem smoother.
[00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:23.110]  In 12 hours, it will stimulate collagen production.
[00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.613]  And in 12 hours, it will promote elastin growth in your skin.
[00:07:26.873 --> 00:07:27.654]  What does this all mean?
[00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:32.276]  Well this is the stuff that makes your skin firm and healthy and helps you look younger.
[00:07:32.556 --> 00:07:41.721]  Night Skin is real and the results are real and it contains only proven ingredients that work to lighten age spots, smooth the skin and help diminish the appearance of wrinkles.
[00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:44.663]  It's easy and in 12 hours you'll see it works.
[00:07:44.883 --> 00:07:46.244]  Try it risk-free today.
[00:07:46.664 --> 00:07:50.387]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:51.808]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.882 --> 00:08:20.123]  Alright, it's Bob Dacey back again, substituting for Alex Jones.
[00:08:20.664 --> 00:08:28.786]  Bob Dacey, I am the host of the Simple Truth TV Show here in Austin, a show which is produced by my dear friends Jeff Kantoff and Kelly Taylor.
[00:08:30.287 --> 00:08:32.667]  But right now, we're doing the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:32.787 --> 00:08:34.708]  So, let me tell you what we're going to do.
[00:08:34.728 --> 00:08:37.369]  I have an article here that the guys gave me the other day.
[00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:43.711]  Alex, the other day, interviewed one of these rock and rollers from Megadeth.
[00:08:44.856 --> 00:08:56.747]  And, uh, there's an article here about it where the, um, the UN types, undispatch.com has responded to the lyrics in a Megadeth song which trashes the UN.
[00:08:57.408 --> 00:08:59.470]  So I want to read a little bit from this article.
[00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:04.354]  This is from their side, but I'm not going to give them fair shake because I don't feel like it.
[00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:06.857]  This was, this was written on July the 10th.
[00:09:08.278 --> 00:09:10.520]  Critic Watch Megadeth Smackdown Edition.
[00:09:11.511 --> 00:09:12.712]  Last summer, U.N.
[00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:18.895]  Dispatch learned that the heavy metal band Megadeth was recording an album titled United Abominations.
[00:09:19.736 --> 00:09:20.336]  We at U.N.
[00:09:20.396 --> 00:09:24.818]  Dispatch refuse to let Megadeth's witless screed go unchallenged.
[00:09:25.339 --> 00:09:32.342]  So this article is them quoting from the lyrics and then defending themselves against the charges.
[00:09:32.362 --> 00:09:34.944]  I'm not going to go through all of it, but I will go through a little bit.
[00:09:35.204 --> 00:09:36.965]  Here's some of the, what they call the rant.
[00:09:36.985 --> 00:09:38.546]  This is a quote from some of the
[00:09:43.188 --> 00:09:49.150]  Less than five miles from Ground Zero sits an international hotbed, the United Abominations, as it were.
[00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:55.631]  Created to prevent wars and promote peace, it failed to address the most dangerous threats facing the world.
[00:09:57.072 --> 00:10:02.333]  In a mire of hypocrisy, bribes, kickbacks and corruption, the U.N.
[00:10:02.453 --> 00:10:06.094]  enables terrorism and ignores sex crimes by its peacekeepers.
[00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:07.611]  I would have to agree with that.
[00:10:07.631 --> 00:10:08.812]  I think that's all true.
[00:10:36.855 --> 00:10:46.062]  Now, they defend themselves, they say, Nowhere in the authoritative 9-1-1 Commission Report is the United Nations cited for enabling terrorist attacks.
[00:10:47.904 --> 00:10:54.629]  Wait a minute, they are using the 9-1-1 Commission Report to defend themselves against an attack?
[00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.231]  Because they claim that it's authoritative?
[00:10:57.291 --> 00:11:05.278]  Now, if you follow anything about anything, you know that the UN 9-1-1 Commission Report, I'm sorry, the 9-1-1 Commission Report
[00:11:06.395 --> 00:11:06.896]  I think?
[00:11:24.932 --> 00:11:31.033]  When I asked the Chairman of the 9-1-1 Commission last year two very pointed questions, he was kind of in trouble trying to answer them.
[00:11:31.113 --> 00:11:35.994]  One of them is why they didn't investigate who financed the killings of 3,000 people.
[00:11:36.834 --> 00:11:39.015]  And the other one was, what about Building 7, buddy?
[00:11:39.275 --> 00:11:41.255]  And he had a real problem answering both questions.
[00:11:41.815 --> 00:11:49.417]  So you know that the 9-1-1 Commission report is a fraud, yet the UN uses it to defend themselves against attacks, saying that it's authoritative.
[00:11:51.425 --> 00:11:58.507]  Okay, the 9-1-1 report stresses the need for greater cooperation at the United Nations to strengthen security standards for travel documents.
[00:11:58.667 --> 00:11:59.307]  Oh yeah, right.
[00:12:00.687 --> 00:12:05.188]  Then they say that the narrator of the song accuses the UN of ignoring sex crimes by peacekeepers.
[00:12:05.789 --> 00:12:09.349]  You can read the UN's zero-tolerance policy on sex crimes here.
[00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.750]  And you can click on and read their policy.
[00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.550]  Who cares about their policy?
[00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.131]  We're talking about the reality!
[00:12:16.025 --> 00:12:24.388]  Everywhere the UN goes, everywhere their peacekeepers go, the number one industry that sets up around them is prostitution.
[00:12:25.368 --> 00:12:25.728]  Okay?
[00:12:26.088 --> 00:12:27.028]  It's a known fact.
[00:12:27.309 --> 00:12:29.389]  Everywhere they go, the prostitutes are there.
[00:12:29.729 --> 00:12:32.470]  And a lot of those prostitutes are underage.
[00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:39.012]  Well documented that they bring in underage prostitutes to service the UN peacekeepers.
[00:12:39.632 --> 00:12:39.952]  Okay?
[00:12:40.633 --> 00:12:42.033]  Who cares about their policy?
[00:12:42.073 --> 00:12:44.794]  Let's talk about reality.
[00:12:45.652 --> 00:12:45.992]  All right.
[00:12:47.954 --> 00:12:54.039]  Another that brings to mind a few years ago when my daughter graduated from St.
[00:12:54.079 --> 00:12:54.940]  Edward's University.
[00:12:56.601 --> 00:13:04.788]  I attended the graduation, of course, and the guest speaker, everybody knows me, knows all about my rancor toward the U.N.
[00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:06.069]  You know, I just can't stand them.
[00:13:06.849 --> 00:13:08.671]  And the guest speaker,
[00:13:09.312 --> 00:13:15.775]  She was a member of the United Nations International Criminal Court, which I will thoroughly trash later on in the show.
[00:13:16.876 --> 00:13:18.096]  She was one of their judges.
[00:13:18.116 --> 00:13:21.698]  I think she's like the vice president of the court or whatever.
[00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:27.060]  Her name is Elizabeth Odio Benito from Costa Rica.
[00:13:28.221 --> 00:13:34.804]  And her big claim to fame in the world is that she protects the rights of women and children.
[00:13:34.864 --> 00:13:36.925]  That's on her resume, how good she is.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.880]  You know, as a U.N.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:39.581]  judge.
[00:13:40.441 --> 00:13:50.544]  But while she was in Eastern Europe, during all that Bosnia stuff, she's over there protecting the rights of women and children while the U.N.
[00:13:51.464 --> 00:13:57.806]  troops are raping the little girls on a regular basis during their peacekeeping operations.
[00:13:58.226 --> 00:14:02.267]  What a gigantic, monstrous, hypocrite!
[00:14:04.268 --> 00:14:05.588]  Okay, so that was an aside.
[00:14:05.608 --> 00:14:07.229]  Let me get back to this article here.
[00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:10.808]  Here's some more lyrics from the song.
[00:14:11.808 --> 00:14:18.093]  Poverty in their kitchens, held hostage by oil for food, yet their own plates are full of the fat of their lands.
[00:14:18.554 --> 00:14:20.776]  There's no blood on their hands, right, Kojo?
[00:14:21.256 --> 00:14:26.920]  They promise to tell the truth without leaving a fingerprint, but they will lose the UN one way or another.
[00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:30.063]  The victim, I fear, will be us, sisters and brothers.
[00:14:30.884 --> 00:14:35.107]  And again, they come back at the lead singer and guitarist, Dave Mustaine.
[00:14:36.285 --> 00:14:42.309]  They say that he seems to be implying that the UN staffers are enriching themselves while the poor in their country suffer.
[00:14:42.789 --> 00:14:46.131]  His evidence is the alleged corruption of the Oil for Food Program.
[00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:59.079]  An investigation of the alleged corruption of the Oil for Food Program led by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker cleared Kofi Annan of any wrongdoing and Kojo has never been accused of committing any crime.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:00.980]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:02.461 --> 00:15:03.662]  So the UN hires
[00:15:04.748 --> 00:15:13.853]  The former Federal Reserve Chairman, you know, the biggest gangster banker in the world, to investigate the United Nations.
[00:15:14.273 --> 00:15:28.801]  You know, Paul Volcker is one of the big shots at the Council on Foreign Relations, the people that created the UN, and so basically what we have here is they have impaneled a group of foxes to determine
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:36.624]  Why all the chickens are missing from the hen house and the foxes have determined that the foxes didn't do it?
[00:15:38.125 --> 00:15:38.525]  Brilliant!
[00:15:39.525 --> 00:15:39.885]  Brilliant!
[00:15:41.246 --> 00:15:54.733]  Kind of reminds me of that time when Janet Reno hired John Danforth to investigate Janet Reno about the Waco thing and lo and behold he found out that she didn't do anything wrong.
[00:15:54.893 --> 00:15:55.053]  Hmm.
[00:15:55.474 --> 00:15:56.074]  Same idea.
[00:15:56.992 --> 00:15:59.494]  Okay, now, it's preposterous.
[00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:00.474]  That's preposterous.
[00:16:00.675 --> 00:16:07.839]  Now, I want to now go through one of the biggest books out there.
[00:16:07.879 --> 00:16:09.280]  It's been out a long time.
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.601]  It's called The Shadows of Power.
[00:16:12.042 --> 00:16:23.270]  It was written by James Perloff, and it talks about the creators of the United Nations, and the creators of the United Nations was in major
[00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:27.658]  I mean, mostly it was this Council of Foreign Relations based in New York.
[00:16:28.218 --> 00:16:38.945]  The Council of Foreign Relations is the American branch of a British group, the Council of International Affairs in Britain.
[00:16:39.585 --> 00:16:41.266]  It's the American version of it.
[00:16:42.326 --> 00:16:46.649]  And I don't want to get too much back into the historical minutiae of it.
[00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:49.812]  But I guess I'll have to, to a degree.
[00:16:50.272 --> 00:17:00.915]  Let me go into some of this book by James Perloff, The Shadows of Power, and we'll talk about the CFR and their addiction to globalism.
[00:17:03.216 --> 00:17:09.198]  Of globalism, the first of these is the CFR advocates the creation of a world government.
[00:17:09.938 --> 00:17:11.919]  The charge is easily substantiated.
[00:17:12.439 --> 00:17:27.888]  Anyone who cares to examine back issues of Foreign Affairs, that's their magazine they've been publishing since 1921, will have no difficulty finding hundreds of articles that pushed, rather zealously or by soft sell, this concept of globalism.
[00:17:29.469 --> 00:17:30.790]  According to Admiral Ward,
[00:17:31.983 --> 00:17:35.144]  The Admiral Ward was a member of the CFR for many, many years, by the way.
[00:17:35.525 --> 00:17:36.105]  I digress.
[00:17:36.145 --> 00:17:37.045]  But he was a member.
[00:17:37.065 --> 00:17:38.186]  He was very critical of them.
[00:17:38.366 --> 00:17:40.447]  But he was in there listening to all their garbage.
[00:17:41.307 --> 00:17:45.729]  According to Admiral Ward, the CFR has a goal, submergence of U.S.
[00:17:45.769 --> 00:17:50.311]  sovereignty and national independence into an all-powerful, one-world government.
[00:17:51.291 --> 00:17:59.895]  He wrote that, quote, this lust to surrender the sovereignty and independence of the United States is pervasive throughout most of the membership, end quote.
[00:18:00.315 --> 00:18:01.516]  And then he added, quote,
[00:18:02.276 --> 00:18:10.720]  In the entire CFR lexicon, there is no term of revulsion carrying a meaning so deep as America First.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.503]  So there you have the CFR and what they want.
[00:18:17.163 --> 00:18:18.103]  They want globalism.
[00:18:18.143 --> 00:18:22.225]  They want one world government and it's not the Republic.
[00:18:23.126 --> 00:18:23.426]  You know?
[00:18:23.506 --> 00:18:24.286]  That's not what they want.
[00:18:24.826 --> 00:18:28.168]  They want an oligarchy where they sit on the top and we all sit on the bottom.
[00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:32.082]  And they don't want that many of us down there sitting on the bottom either.
[00:18:33.142 --> 00:18:38.863]  They want to kill about 80% of us, you know, by the time it's all over.
[00:18:39.524 --> 00:18:52.667]  And, you know, if you want to get some documentation on that, by the way, what you can do is you can go to InfoWars.com and you can pre-order Alex's latest documentary, Endgame.
[00:18:53.473 --> 00:18:54.913]  Because that's what it's all about.
[00:18:55.253 --> 00:19:00.075]  So you can go to Infowars.com and preorder Endgame, which is, I think, going to be released real soon.
[00:19:02.315 --> 00:19:04.676]  I would be remiss if I didn't plug Endgame.
[00:19:05.796 --> 00:19:11.618]  OK, now let's talk about some of these people that founded this organization, the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:19:13.038 --> 00:19:14.719]  1921, Edward Mandelhouse.
[00:19:14.979 --> 00:19:19.120]  OK, this guy was Woodrow Wilson's right hand man.
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.121]  He was the Henry Kissinger of his day.
[00:19:23.172 --> 00:19:32.258]  And as an aside, kind of a disgusting aside, Edward Mandelhouse lived in Austin for a while, which is where this broadcast emanates from.
[00:19:33.779 --> 00:19:40.923]  And one of the local football fields is named after him, House Park, because he donated the land for it around 1911 or so.
[00:19:41.804 --> 00:19:48.328]  So, when we get back, we're going to talk a little bit about Mr. House and the CFR and our UN Bash-a-thon will continue.
[00:19:48.348 --> 00:19:51.870]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:01.989 --> 00:20:04.872]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:20:05.212 --> 00:20:08.075]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:20:08.315 --> 00:20:14.501]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:20:14.902 --> 00:20:22.209]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:26.473]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:20:26.753 --> 00:20:32.296]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[00:20:32.496 --> 00:20:45.604]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[00:20:45.804 --> 00:20:54.429]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Food and Places USA now for only $29, plus shipping and handling, by calling New Millennium at 888-625-4000.
[00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:03.751]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[00:21:04.132 --> 00:21:14.114]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[00:21:14.615 --> 00:21:20.136]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:21.557]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July.
[00:21:23.832 --> 00:21:29.362]  With falls of 32 billion in the last two weeks alone, could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:37.435]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency, and the quality of the dollar is poor, because the quantity is so high.
[00:21:37.815 --> 00:21:43.599]  Printing money out of thin air has disastrous results, victimizing middle-class citizens and discouraging savings.
[00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:48.662]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[00:21:49.063 --> 00:21:51.644]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[00:21:52.105 --> 00:21:53.626]  Call me, Tom Andrew, at 1-800-606-1294.
[00:21:53.706 --> 00:21:54.006]  That's 1-800-606-1294.
[00:22:02.691 --> 00:22:04.772]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:05.392 --> 00:22:14.336]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.776 --> 00:22:21.979]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.694 --> 00:22:28.177]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:22:28.677 --> 00:22:39.503]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:40.263 --> 00:22:42.344]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:22:57.755 --> 00:23:04.740]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:05.401 --> 00:23:12.046]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[00:23:13.227 --> 00:23:15.489]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[00:23:16.292 --> 00:23:22.517]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[00:23:23.438 --> 00:23:31.545]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[00:23:32.566 --> 00:23:40.433]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:24:01.374 --> 00:24:16.273]  Way up north to Alaska Way up north to Alaska North to Alaska To go north for the rest of your song North to Alaska To go north for the rest of your song
[00:24:18.716 --> 00:24:20.517]  Alright, this is Bob Dacey.
[00:24:20.617 --> 00:24:22.417]  I'm in a rush to bash the U.N.
[00:24:22.457 --> 00:24:25.378]  right now, so we're going to take that song down here pretty quick.
[00:24:25.818 --> 00:24:35.900]  Before I continue my bash-a-thon, I want to remind you that for those of you in the Austin area, that Alex's new film, Endgame, will be having its premiere engagement at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema.
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.560]  Take down these dates.
[00:24:38.221 --> 00:24:41.061]  October the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th, and then November the 5th and 7th,
[00:24:44.696 --> 00:24:50.260]  And Alex Jones will be live at the October 22nd and November the 5th engagements.
[00:24:51.441 --> 00:25:00.327]  And you want to go see that if you're in the Austin area or if you're anywhere in Central Texas, it'll be great because as Alex Jones says, they want you dead.
[00:25:00.907 --> 00:25:01.308]  All right.
[00:25:01.988 --> 00:25:06.571]  Now, I was quoting from the Shadows of Power by James Perloff before the break.
[00:25:07.352 --> 00:25:14.337]  And I was talking about Edward Mandel House and how he was President Wilson's Henry Kissinger.
[00:25:19.488 --> 00:25:21.509]  Mr. House is my second personality.
[00:25:21.969 --> 00:25:23.490]  He is my independent self.
[00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.631]  His thoughts and mine are one.
[00:25:26.111 --> 00:25:29.533]  If I were in his place, I would do just as he suggested.
[00:25:30.033 --> 00:25:36.056]  If anyone thinks he is reflecting my opinion by whatever action he takes, they are welcome to the conclusion.
[00:25:44.102 --> 00:25:48.505]  This is one of House's convictions about our Constitution.
[00:25:48.925 --> 00:25:49.565]  You ready for this?
[00:25:49.585 --> 00:26:09.578]  According to his own biographer, Arthur D. Howden Smith, House believed that, quote, the Constitution, a product of 18th century minds and a quasi-classical medieval conception of republics, was thoroughly outdated, that the country would be better off if the Constitution could be scrapped and rewritten.
[00:26:10.359 --> 00:26:10.699]  We're good to go.
[00:26:31.559 --> 00:26:36.902]  Again, according to his biographer, he wrote it in a fictional form in order to obtain a wider audience for it.
[00:26:37.302 --> 00:26:48.948]  And basically, it's about an American military officer who ends up overthrowing our government, overthrowing our Constitution, overthrowing our Bill of Rights, and installing a dictatorship with him at the head.
[00:26:49.848 --> 00:26:55.671]  And according to the book, according to what House intended for the book,
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:05.728]  What may seem surprising is that the character Philip Drew is attempting to install what he called, quote, socialism as dreamed of by Karl Marx.
[00:27:06.329 --> 00:27:14.756]  So there there you have this guy was the founder of the Council on Foreign Relations in 1921.
[00:27:14.817 --> 00:27:20.642]  This guy, he was the main main drive for because at the end of World War One,
[00:27:21.831 --> 00:27:28.594]  The globalists in charge at that time, their League of Nations fell on its face because the US Senate refused to ratify the treaty.
[00:27:29.295 --> 00:27:35.297]  So they decided, well, we need to get this CFR going so that we can go propagandize the American people.
[00:27:35.337 --> 00:27:40.660]  So the next time we try for this globalist body, the United Nations, they'll go for it.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.181]  So let's talk about gains for globalism.
[00:27:44.221 --> 00:27:46.062]  This is how the CFR creates the UN.
[00:27:47.363 --> 00:27:48.103]  This is from the book.
[00:27:49.275 --> 00:27:50.876]  Most Americans believe the U.N.
[00:27:50.896 --> 00:27:55.520]  was formed after World War II as a result of international revulsion at the horrors of the war.
[00:27:56.421 --> 00:28:02.126]  Actually, it originated in CFR intellects, and the term United Nations was in use as early as 1942.
[00:28:02.266 --> 00:28:15.837]  In January 1943, Secretary of State Cordell Hull formed a steering committee composed of himself, Neo, Plovalsky, Isaiah Bowman, Sumner Wells, Norman Davis, and Myron Taylor.
[00:28:16.477 --> 00:28:17.158]  All these men,
[00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:23.372]  With the exception of Hull, we're in the CFR, later known as the Informal Agenda Group.
[00:28:24.552 --> 00:28:27.093]  They drafted the original proposal for the United Nations.
[00:28:27.674 --> 00:28:35.156]  It was Bowman, a founder of the CFR and a member of Colonel House's old inquiry, who first put forward the concept.
[00:28:35.997 --> 00:28:40.918]  They called in three attorneys, all CFR men, who ruled that it was constitutional.
[00:28:41.599 --> 00:28:43.499]  They then discussed it with FDR on June 15, 1944.
[00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:48.790]  The President approved the plan and announced it to the public that same day.
[00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:50.151]  The U.N.
[00:28:50.211 --> 00:28:53.072]  founding conference took place in San Francisco in 1945.
[00:28:54.453 --> 00:28:58.394]  More than 40 of the American delegates attending were CFR members.
[00:28:59.114 --> 00:29:07.818]  Prominent among them was Soviet agent Alger Hiss, who was Secretary General of the conference and helped draft the U.N.
[00:29:07.878 --> 00:29:08.258]  Charter.
[00:29:09.018 --> 00:29:15.241]  Okay, Alger Hiss, CFR member, was later arrested, charged and convicted
[00:29:16.016 --> 00:29:20.698]  of being a spy for the Soviet Union.
[00:29:20.778 --> 00:29:25.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, okay, this is how the U.N.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.621]  gets started with a spy for Stalin.
[00:29:28.641 --> 00:29:30.102]  Alright?
[00:29:30.662 --> 00:29:34.683]  Alright, when we get back from this break, we're going to continue with our U.N.
[00:29:34.743 --> 00:29:35.344]  Bash-a-thon.
[00:29:35.364 --> 00:29:38.665]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:51.892 --> 00:29:54.899]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.801 --> 00:29:58.507]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:06.492]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:30:06.732 --> 00:30:11.595]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:11.835 --> 00:30:13.156]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:13.336 --> 00:30:16.677]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:31:09.619 --> 00:31:10.960]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:19.404]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:31:27.367 --> 00:31:29.468]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:31:29.548 --> 00:31:33.893]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:31:34.073 --> 00:31:36.216]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:31:36.316 --> 00:31:44.084]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:31:44.565 --> 00:31:44.885]  We're good.
[00:32:01.807 --> 00:32:02.547]  Job stress.
[00:32:02.707 --> 00:32:03.848]  Painful relationships.
[00:32:04.048 --> 00:32:05.328]  Unbearable money pressures.
[00:32:05.408 --> 00:32:06.989]  Deteriorating health conditions.
[00:32:07.169 --> 00:32:13.491]  Are political uncertainties and a world spinning out of control keeping you from getting the restful sleep your body desperately needs?
[00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:14.292]  It's true.
[00:32:14.532 --> 00:32:18.293]  Researchers now know that insufficient sleep can lead to dangerous health problems.
[00:32:18.353 --> 00:32:18.693]  I think so.
[00:32:41.084 --> 00:32:41.484]  It is a big idea.
[00:32:41.544 --> 00:32:41.924]  A new world order.
[00:33:10.146 --> 00:33:14.349]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:33:16.371 --> 00:33:18.572]  It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[00:33:19.233 --> 00:33:21.475]  Both their objectives being world domination.
[00:33:23.656 --> 00:33:26.138]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:33:27.019 --> 00:33:33.003]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:33:41.169 --> 00:33:46.255]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:33:48.037 --> 00:33:52.742]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:33:52.782 --> 00:33:59.489]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world where only an educated and informed public can stop them in their tracks.
[00:34:02.452 --> 00:34:06.094]  For the first time, all the pieces have been put together.
[00:34:06.174 --> 00:34:09.596]  The dots have been connected, and the picture is crystal clear.
[00:34:10.677 --> 00:34:14.199]  Earth's ruling elite believe they have discovered the fountain.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:19.242]  But before they can attain it, 80% of us must die.
[00:34:19.262 --> 00:34:26.806]  A psychopathic technocracy is establishing world government so there can be no escape from their plan.
[00:34:32.213 --> 00:34:34.435]  The New World Order is the Old World Order.
[00:34:34.495 --> 00:34:37.196]  I mean, it's just the names have changed, the appearances have changed.
[00:34:37.457 --> 00:34:38.597]  Most people have no idea.
[00:34:38.617 --> 00:34:39.398]  They're not after money.
[00:34:39.418 --> 00:34:40.499]  They have all the money they need.
[00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:41.499]  They're after power.
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.401]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:34:46.223 --> 00:34:48.724]  A pull-out of a plane, a new one, they could be interrogated in four hours.
[00:34:48.784 --> 00:34:49.765]  Some shots were fired.
[00:34:49.845 --> 00:34:51.146]  It's easy to move off the province.
[00:34:52.167 --> 00:34:55.569]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:35:00.635 --> 00:35:03.157]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:35:03.457 --> 00:35:05.058]  You have been warned.
[00:35:11.261 --> 00:35:13.923]  Okay, that was Alex Jones talking about Endgame.
[00:35:13.943 --> 00:35:14.903]  You gotta buy Endgame.
[00:35:14.943 --> 00:35:18.405]  Go to Infowars.com and pre-order that sucker, alright?
[00:35:19.206 --> 00:35:21.107]  And call your friends and tell them to do the same thing.
[00:35:21.307 --> 00:35:22.568]  Gotta get this information out.
[00:35:23.715 --> 00:35:26.956]  Okay, before the break, I was bashing the U.N.
[00:35:27.417 --> 00:35:29.598]  and I'm going to digress from bashing the U.N.
[00:35:29.618 --> 00:35:34.160]  for just a minute to remind you that President Bush loves the U.N.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.820]  He just thinks it's great.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:45.164]  He loves globalism and those neocons out there who think that he hates them and that he's an independent American and he can't stand all them U.N.
[00:35:45.204 --> 00:35:45.445]  people.
[00:35:45.965 --> 00:35:47.505]  You just don't know your facts.
[00:35:47.525 --> 00:35:50.927]  I'm going to give you two examples right now of how President Bush
[00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:58.218]  Loves globalism and he hates the national sovereignty concept when it comes to the United States of America.
[00:35:58.678 --> 00:36:01.742]  Looking at an article from World Net Daily dated Monday, October the 8th.
[00:36:03.084 --> 00:36:05.647]  Bush backs Mexico rapist murderer.
[00:36:06.588 --> 00:36:09.511]  International court seeks to block death penalty in Texas.
[00:36:10.332 --> 00:36:10.833]  Washington.
[00:36:12.273 --> 00:36:12.633]  The U.S.
[00:36:12.653 --> 00:36:23.219]  Supreme Court will hear a case Wednesday in which the Bush administration will seek to overturn the death penalty of a convicted rapist murderer at the behest of the International Court of Justice.
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:37.928]  Jose Medellin confessed in 1993 to participating in the rape and murder of two Houston teenagers, Jennifer Erkman and Elizabeth Pena, were sodomized and strangled with their shoelaces.
[00:36:38.934 --> 00:36:44.118]  Medellin bragged about keeping one girl's Mickey Mouse watch as a souvenir of the crime.
[00:36:45.419 --> 00:36:55.266]  The intervention in the case by the Bush administration comes after the International Court of Justice found Medellin was not informed of his right to contact the Mexican consulate for legal assistance.
[00:36:56.266 --> 00:37:02.491]  And then the Texas Solicitor General, Ted Cruz, says, We find ourselves in an unusual position.
[00:37:03.081 --> 00:37:12.308]  Texas is not regularly litigating against the United States, but sadly enough, the United States will appear alongside Medellin at the argument.
[00:37:14.189 --> 00:37:28.199]  And way later on in the article, it says, Cruz, who will argue the case for Texas, called Bush's unprecedented attempt to issue orders to the judicial branch, and the state courts in particular, breathtaking.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.240]  Quote,
[00:37:30.111 --> 00:37:34.476]  It is emphatically not the province of the president to say what the law is, end quote.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:44.907]  He told the Houston Chronicle, quote, if this president's assertion of authority is upheld in this case, it opens the door for enormous mischief from presidents of either party.
[00:37:45.227 --> 00:37:50.091]  What might these presidents be inclined to do if they had the power to flick state laws off the books?
[00:37:51.292 --> 00:37:54.754]  Yeah, or they could flick the United States Constitution off the books.
[00:37:54.774 --> 00:38:04.501]  Here's a classic example, one of a legion of them, of President Bush, who, as governor of Texas, presided over the executions of hundreds of people.
[00:38:05.473 --> 00:38:06.974]  Oh, but now he's the president.
[00:38:07.014 --> 00:38:15.558]  He's Mr. Globalist, and now he's siding with a convicted rapist murderer over the state of Texas.
[00:38:16.179 --> 00:38:19.341]  Now, neocons, put that in your pipe and smoke it, okay?
[00:38:19.961 --> 00:38:21.302]  Now, here's another one.
[00:38:22.422 --> 00:38:25.884]  Got this from the American Statesman here on the 13th.
[00:38:26.925 --> 00:38:31.147]  This is by Dan Baltz and Juliet Elkrin of the Washington Post.
[00:38:32.067 --> 00:38:33.148]  Global warming.
[00:38:33.786 --> 00:38:36.929]  Nobel Peace Prize tops Gore's year of accolades.
[00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:54.965]  He's sharing the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with the UN Scientific Panel and he will use the award to heighten awareness of, quote, a true planetary emergency, end quote, from global warming and press the world's nations to combat its threats.
[00:38:56.086 --> 00:38:58.688]  Gore said he was deeply honored to be cited for his work
[00:38:59.324 --> 00:39:04.328]  And to share the prize with the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
[00:39:05.288 --> 00:39:21.320]  John Ashton, Britain's Special Representative for Climate Change, said, quote, The international community now understands that this is not only an environmental challenge, like other environmental challenges, it is a fundamental challenge to international peace and security.
[00:39:22.661 --> 00:39:23.902]  Senator John Kerry said,
[00:39:26.011 --> 00:39:29.632]  This is a very important statement of transition on a global level.
[00:39:30.993 --> 00:39:35.554]  It's not only a tribute to Al's work, but a wake-up call to the administration and the U.S.
[00:39:35.914 --> 00:39:38.195]  who have been the global delayer on this.
[00:39:39.815 --> 00:39:43.757]  And later on in the article it says that the climate panel, a group of more than 2,000 scientists from 130 countries,
[00:39:46.389 --> 00:39:57.877]  Definitely blamed humans for global warming and said that rising temperatures, if left unchecked, would lead to widespread coastal flooding, starvation, and species extinction!
[00:39:58.697 --> 00:39:59.278]  Boo!
[00:39:59.398 --> 00:40:00.699]  It's almost Halloween!
[00:40:00.719 --> 00:40:05.402]  Alright, now why did I read that in the middle of this bush thing?
[00:40:05.422 --> 00:40:10.025]  Well, it's because... Well, first, let me just digress.
[00:40:11.013 --> 00:40:18.017]  Again, yeah, if global warming is happening, and you know, there's some argument that the Earth is warming up, it's because of the sun!
[00:40:18.037 --> 00:40:21.839]  It's not because of you, it's not because of me, it's because of the sun!
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:27.203]  I would like Al Gore to explain how come Mars' ice caps are melting.
[00:40:28.483 --> 00:40:30.244]  It's because of the sun, Gore Boy!
[00:40:30.284 --> 00:40:31.165]  Don't you understand it?
[00:40:32.077 --> 00:40:51.904]  Or maybe, maybe Mars, because of its proximity to the Earth and millions and millions of miles away as it orbits way out there, maybe some of the, some of the fumes from Earth are, are wafting through space and, and going out there and getting on Mars and melting their polar ice caps.
[00:40:51.984 --> 00:40:55.705]  Maybe, maybe, maybe it's your SUV that did that.
[00:40:56.945 --> 00:40:58.646]  Come on, that's a Croc, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:59.471 --> 00:41:01.992]  Why are the polar ice caps on Mars receding?
[00:41:03.793 --> 00:41:05.554]  I don't think Earth has anything to do with it.
[00:41:06.254 --> 00:41:08.135]  Anyway, I read that because I want to read this.
[00:41:09.856 --> 00:41:14.078]  This is from the American Statesman on the 4th of October.
[00:41:15.338 --> 00:41:17.059]  This is by Jim Abrams, Associated Press.
[00:41:17.639 --> 00:41:21.621]  As polar ice melts, White House warms to the U.N.
[00:41:22.201 --> 00:41:23.622]  Law of the Sea pact.
[00:41:24.703 --> 00:41:27.724]  Oh man, here's a sea monster that just will not go away.
[00:41:28.388 --> 00:41:30.570]  And an opportunity to bash the U.N.
[00:41:31.851 --> 00:41:32.311]  Washington.
[00:41:32.812 --> 00:41:46.244]  The White House is pushing the Senate to ratify a long-spurned Sea Treaty that has gained new relevance with the melting of the polar ice cap and anticipated competition for the oil that lies below.
[00:41:47.825 --> 00:41:55.932]  The United States needs to join the law of the Sea Convention and do it now, Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England told Senators recently.
[00:41:57.688 --> 00:42:01.670]  And here's a quote from Joe Biden, the committee's chairman.
[00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:08.254]  Far from threatening our sovereignty, the convention allows us to secure and extend our sovereign rights.
[00:42:10.395 --> 00:42:11.576]  Pardon me while I throw up.
[00:42:13.457 --> 00:42:15.178]  Opponents say it would impinge on the U.S.
[00:42:15.218 --> 00:42:16.658]  military and economic sovereignty.
[00:42:18.559 --> 00:42:21.381]  This is from Senator Jim Imhoff, Republican of Oklahoma.
[00:42:22.029 --> 00:42:23.793]  It's one more erosion of our sovereignty.
[00:42:34.326 --> 00:42:35.287]  Now, here's your deal.
[00:42:35.327 --> 00:42:38.449]  You've got the Bush administration who just hates the U.N.
[00:42:39.129 --> 00:42:40.710]  Oh, they just hate him so much.
[00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.151]  All the neocons will tell you that.
[00:42:42.371 --> 00:42:43.732]  Oh, Bush just hates the U.N.
[00:42:44.232 --> 00:42:48.775]  He is jumping on this Law of the Sea Treaty, which they keep resurrecting.
[00:42:49.176 --> 00:42:50.677]  Now, what is the Law of the Sea Treaty?
[00:42:51.097 --> 00:43:00.463]  I'm not going to bore you with all the boring details, but I have an article written in 2004 by William F. Jasper of the New American Magazine
[00:43:01.326 --> 00:43:04.187]  It's called We Lose If Lost Wins.
[00:43:04.728 --> 00:43:12.411]  And I'd like to excerpt from it just to explain to you what the Law of the Sea Treaty that the Bush Administration is backing really is.
[00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:20.475]  The treaty does create new jurisdictions and governing structures with real powers that threaten our national sovereignty.
[00:43:21.115 --> 00:43:26.137]  Among other things, Lost establishes an International Seabed Authority.
[00:43:26.218 --> 00:43:27.058]  That's the ISA.
[00:43:27.984 --> 00:43:33.989]  A new UN agency, oh boy, to control the minerals and other wealth of the seafloor.
[00:43:34.729 --> 00:43:39.633]  This also means granting the ISA control over two-thirds of the Earth's surface.
[00:43:40.934 --> 00:43:42.055]  No trifling matter.
[00:43:42.856 --> 00:43:47.439]  Loss designates this vast watery commons as the area.
[00:43:50.771 --> 00:43:58.277]  Article 136 of the treaty declares, quote, the area and its resources are the common heritage of mankind, end quote.
[00:43:58.877 --> 00:44:11.307]  And Article 137 informs us, quote, all rights in the resources of the area are vested in mankind as a whole on whose behalf the authority shall act, end quote.
[00:44:12.308 --> 00:44:13.489]  That is certainly reassuring.
[00:44:13.509 --> 00:44:18.753]  The UN kleptocracy that has given us the massive Iraqi oil-for-food rip-off
[00:44:19.409 --> 00:44:29.791]  And that has a proven record to be a bottomless sinkhole of corruption for the nearly 60 years it is to administer the wealth of the oceans for the benefit of mankind.
[00:44:31.552 --> 00:44:47.895]  And later on in William F. Jasper's article, Under Lost, the UN will finally have the tax and regulatory powers it has lusted after for so long, together with a commercial income stream independent of the purse strings of national legislatures.
[00:44:48.613 --> 00:44:56.315]  Any entrepreneur wishing to explore or mine the ocean floor would have to pay the authority and provide technical assistance to the enterprise.
[00:44:56.976 --> 00:45:00.777]  Alright, so you understand, the UN, ladies and gentlemen, let's go to the bottom line.
[00:45:00.797 --> 00:45:14.521]  These scum-sucking pigs at the UN, these sons of a motherless goat, are out to grab two-thirds of the earth and put it under their communist, socialist, totalitarian's thumb.
[00:45:15.439 --> 00:45:17.220]  That's what the Lost Treaty is.
[00:45:17.901 --> 00:45:18.741]  And guess what?
[00:45:19.041 --> 00:45:21.383]  The Bush Administration is backing it.
[00:45:22.244 --> 00:45:23.304]  Got that, neocons?
[00:45:23.665 --> 00:45:24.485]  When you can learn.
[00:45:25.946 --> 00:45:26.286]  Okay.
[00:45:26.947 --> 00:45:27.167]  Now.
[00:45:29.008 --> 00:45:30.929]  Oh, I want to make a little announcement here before I forget.
[00:45:30.949 --> 00:45:33.591]  Before I continue my bash-a-thon of the UN.
[00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:39.155]  I was just reading an article there from William F. Jasper of the New American Magazine.
[00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:50.767]  Tomorrow, in the second hour from 12 to 1 Central Time, the President of the John Birch Society will be my special guest here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:51.567 --> 00:45:54.287]  So that's from 12 to 1 tomorrow on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:45:54.928 --> 00:46:08.831]  We expect John McManus, the President of the John Birch Society, to join me and we're going to discuss the Birch Society's latest efforts to stop the North American Union, which is job one, number one project
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.281]  In the whole world, right now.
[00:46:11.962 --> 00:46:22.529]  Because if we don't stop the UN, and this is part of the UN, that's part of the global government scheme, to merge continents before we merge them into one global government.
[00:46:22.869 --> 00:46:25.771]  If we don't stop the North American Union, we're going to be toast.
[00:46:26.212 --> 00:46:29.954]  So anyway, that's tomorrow, from 12 to 1, roughly.
[00:46:30.615 --> 00:46:34.397]  John McManus, the president of the John Birch Society, will be joining us.
[00:46:34.717 --> 00:46:38.260]  And you might want to go to www.jbs.org
[00:46:39.756 --> 00:46:44.978]  And go to www.thenewamerican.com and check up on it.
[00:46:45.678 --> 00:46:54.262]  Okay, now, bashing the United Nations, one of my favorite things to do, is so easy.
[00:46:54.982 --> 00:46:57.763]  All you have to do is tell the truth.
[00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:02.745]  Now, I'm not going to, I have the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in my hands right now.
[00:47:02.765 --> 00:47:05.706]  This is the founding era document of the United Nations.
[00:47:05.786 --> 00:47:06.966]  It was written in 1948.
[00:47:09.977 --> 00:47:16.258]  1948.
[00:47:11.057 --> 00:47:16.258]  And this proves that the UN has not gone astray from its intended purpose.
[00:47:17.099 --> 00:47:24.660]  It's just not doing its intended purpose as well as they would like, which is one world government and to destroy our country.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:38.603]  Now, all you gotta do to find this document is to go on the UN website, click on English, click on the little gold bar at the top that says Human Rights, and then click on Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and you can read it for yourself.
[00:47:39.301 --> 00:47:45.686]  You know, and I'm not going to go through it in any detail like I've done in the past, because basically that would take up the whole hour.
[00:47:46.646 --> 00:47:51.750]  But I do want to point out a few things that it says in here, which are disgusting.
[00:47:53.871 --> 00:47:55.793]  Which is mainly Article 29, Section 3.
[00:47:55.833 --> 00:47:59.015]  Article 29, Section 3 is the biggie.
[00:47:59.696 --> 00:48:05.677]  You got this thing that in flowery language tells you you have more rights than anybody could possibly imagine.
[00:48:06.158 --> 00:48:12.939]  A lot of them, they're all bogus by the way, so you can just forget about how great they are, because they're not, they're bogus.
[00:48:13.799 --> 00:48:18.821]  But Article 29, Section 3 takes them all away!
[00:48:20.141 --> 00:48:23.382]  The bogus rights that UN gives you are taken away by Article 29, Section 3.
[00:48:23.442 --> 00:48:24.062]  Let me read that.
[00:48:26.202 --> 00:48:28.403]  These rights and freedoms may in no case
[00:48:29.255 --> 00:48:30.095]  Let me read that again.
[00:48:30.115 --> 00:48:31.035]  What does that mean, no case?
[00:48:31.055 --> 00:48:33.616]  How many cases does that mean you get to exercise them?
[00:48:33.636 --> 00:48:33.856]  No case.
[00:48:34.436 --> 00:48:40.858]  In other words, ladies and gentlemen, you disagree with the UN, you don't have any human rights.
[00:48:57.645 --> 00:48:58.605]  They wrote this in 1948.
[00:48:59.766 --> 00:49:00.906]  Founding era document.
[00:49:01.027 --> 00:49:01.527]  And they love it.
[00:49:01.827 --> 00:49:02.327]  They love it!
[00:49:03.508 --> 00:49:08.810]  Now, Article 30 punctuates Article 29.
[00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:13.572]  Because what it says is, you also have no right to disagree with anything in this document.
[00:49:14.112 --> 00:49:14.753]  That's what it says.
[00:49:15.353 --> 00:49:15.833]  Let me read it.
[00:49:16.133 --> 00:49:16.513]  Verbatim.
[00:49:17.014 --> 00:49:17.474]  Article 30.
[00:49:18.995 --> 00:49:24.237]  Nothing in this declaration may be interpreted as implying for any state, group, or person
[00:49:25.288 --> 00:49:35.015]  Any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein.
[00:49:36.336 --> 00:49:37.537]  There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:38.038 --> 00:49:50.747]  According to this Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the glorious attainment of human rights, the next step above the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution, aren't you just falling over with joy?
[00:49:51.508 --> 00:49:54.570]  According to this document, you have no right to disagree with it.
[00:49:55.788 --> 00:50:04.213]  And by the way, one of the rights that they mention in here that you have no right to disagree with is in Article 28.
[00:50:05.854 --> 00:50:15.100]  Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration can be fully realized.
[00:50:15.701 --> 00:50:25.207]  So you see, ladies and gentlemen, this document, 1948, tells you one of your human rights is to a new world order.
[00:50:26.252 --> 00:50:29.273]  And again, Article 30 says you have no right to oppose it.
[00:50:30.633 --> 00:50:39.756]  So, again, the United Nations, I've said this many times, is an excrement sandwich with chocolate frosting on the outside.
[00:50:40.576 --> 00:50:45.278]  It looks real good, but don't you dare take a bite, because you're not going to like what you taste.
[00:50:46.118 --> 00:50:52.980]  Alright, we'll be back after this break and continue our UN Bash-a-thon on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:03.591]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.611 --> 00:51:05.711]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.412 --> 00:51:10.653]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:11.313 --> 00:51:13.514]  It's known as the Bilderberg Theory.
[00:51:14.014 --> 00:51:16.375]  Isn't their objective to beat world domination?
[00:51:16.915 --> 00:51:19.376]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:20.117 --> 00:51:27.439]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:35.433]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.894 --> 00:51:39.376]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.776 --> 00:51:42.278]  Bill of Rights makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:42.338 --> 00:51:43.479]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.499 --> 00:51:44.239]  They're not after money.
[00:51:44.259 --> 00:51:45.340]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.301]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.561 --> 00:51:47.381]  That's what they're after.
[00:51:47.702 --> 00:51:52.245]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:51:52.445 --> 00:51:55.887]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:56.007 --> 00:51:59.189]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:59.229 --> 00:52:00.250]  You have been warned.
[00:52:01.611 --> 00:52:05.175]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:05.215 --> 00:52:05.735]  are located?
[00:52:05.935 --> 00:52:09.318]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:14.243]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:52:14.543 --> 00:52:21.470]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas, brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:21.930]  I think so.
[00:52:38.527 --> 00:52:39.127]  We're good to go.
[00:53:01.005 --> 00:53:01.665]  It's a fact.
[00:53:01.846 --> 00:53:09.390]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:18.035]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, all debt has become mathematically impossible to repay, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:53:18.296 --> 00:53:28.942]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:53:29.182 --> 00:53:35.286]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:53:35.506 --> 00:53:40.569]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:53:40.769 --> 00:53:45.272]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:53:45.452 --> 00:53:47.273]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:53:47.313 --> 00:53:47.573]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:53:47.593 --> 00:53:48.114]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:53:48.134 --> 00:53:50.015]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:25.651]  Okay, Bob Basie, back on the Alex Jones Show, substituting for Alex Jones, and again, we've been talking about bashing the U.N., and boy, I just love to bash the U.N., because they're a bunch of scum-sucking pigs and sons of a motherless goat.
[00:54:26.394 --> 00:54:27.954]  And they are pathetic and worthless.
[00:54:28.034 --> 00:54:30.675]  I mean, what else can I say?
[00:54:30.695 --> 00:54:32.075]  Let's give you another example of that.
[00:54:32.195 --> 00:54:38.136]  We're talking about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, their founding document that they all kiss the behind of all the time.
[00:54:39.277 --> 00:54:40.377]  Let's talk about Article 19.
[00:54:41.197 --> 00:54:50.559]  That is the freedom of the press article that the UN enshrines gloriously as one of your glorious human rights.
[00:54:50.899 --> 00:54:51.379]  Let's read it.
[00:54:52.779 --> 00:54:55.380]  Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression.
[00:54:56.064 --> 00:55:12.174]  This right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers.
[00:55:12.755 --> 00:55:16.217]  Now Bob, come on, how could you be against that?
[00:55:16.237 --> 00:55:19.039]  Well I'm not against that.
[00:55:19.559 --> 00:55:21.420]  Problem is, they're against that.
[00:55:22.641 --> 00:55:24.282]  These guys will even
[00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:27.330]  Trash their own press corps!
[00:55:28.791 --> 00:55:32.633]  And blow off Article 19 if it interferes with what they want!
[00:55:33.374 --> 00:55:34.635]  What, you want an example?
[00:55:34.655 --> 00:55:35.615]  Okay.
[00:55:37.616 --> 00:55:42.799]  Have a story from Newsmax.com, dated May the 27th, 2003.
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:46.181]  UN slamming the door on Taiwan.
[00:55:47.702 --> 00:55:55.167]  And exhorting from it, Secretary General Kofi Annan refused to let the Director General of Taiwan's Economic Office
[00:55:56.465 --> 00:56:01.809]  In New York City, brief reporters on Taipei's response to the SARS crisis.
[00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:04.751]  Okay, let me just go through this real briefly.
[00:56:05.352 --> 00:56:08.735]  Okay, a few years ago we had the SARS crisis, that disease.
[00:56:09.315 --> 00:56:10.556]  It was going to kill us all, right?
[00:56:10.836 --> 00:56:19.263]  Okay, so they're going to have a conference in New York and Taiwan, which is over there where the disease is, wanted to send a representative.
[00:56:19.603 --> 00:56:22.725]  You know, because they're all part of global humanity and all that, right?
[00:56:23.266 --> 00:56:23.466]  Okay.
[00:56:24.264 --> 00:56:25.145]  And back to the article.
[00:56:25.665 --> 00:56:32.911]  In explaining Anand's recent reversal, spokesman Fred Eckert explained that the UN has a firm one-China policy.
[00:56:33.852 --> 00:56:39.657]  And then, of course, the president of the United Nations Correspondence Association, that's their own press guys, okay?
[00:56:40.318 --> 00:56:42.640]  The guy's name is Jenkins.
[00:56:43.781 --> 00:56:47.844]  The UN's own press corps, he says, he told reporters that, quote,
[00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:55.043]  The government of the People's Republic of China is the only government that has chosen to interfere with our right to speak with whomever we please."
[00:57:08.678 --> 00:57:10.421]  What's the matter with Article 19?
[00:57:10.982 --> 00:57:18.352]  Don't you respect Article 19, our right to disseminate information regardless of borders and without interference?
[00:57:18.412 --> 00:57:22.058]  And why didn't you let the guy from Taiwan into the SARS conference?
[00:57:22.825 --> 00:57:41.249]  And Kofi Annan looked this guy square in the face and told him, Yes, we love the Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of the Human Rights, but you must respect our principles, and one of them is that there is only one China.
[00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:43.230]  So there you have it.
[00:57:43.965 --> 00:57:54.089]  Kofi Annan was actually trumping Article 19 with Article 29, Section 3, which says you don't have any rights if you disagree with the UN.
[00:57:54.429 --> 00:57:55.489]  I mean, there you have it.
[00:57:55.729 --> 00:57:59.470]  They'll go after their own press corps and trash their so-called rights.
[00:58:00.051 --> 00:58:00.931]  That's documented.
[00:58:00.971 --> 00:58:03.032]  You can watch Kofi say it on TV.
[00:58:03.632 --> 00:58:03.952]  You know?
[00:58:04.652 --> 00:58:05.653]  So, tell me about it.
[00:58:05.693 --> 00:58:09.774]  Tell me about how glorious, how glorious and wonderful the UN is.
[00:58:10.396 --> 00:58:14.438]  They're a bunch of scum, and they're a bunch of trash, and that's all there is to it.
[00:58:14.858 --> 00:58:18.420]  Smiley face totalitarians is all they are.
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:19.060]  You got that?
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:27.944]  Smiley face totalitarian scum, and I'll say that till the cows come home, even though I'm violating their universal declaration by doing so.
[00:58:28.484 --> 00:58:30.465]  Alright, this is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones.
[00:58:31.065 --> 00:58:35.087]  We'll be back in a very short time to continue our UN Bash-a-thon.
[00:58:41.488 --> 00:58:46.382]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.728 --> 00:59:02.150]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:03.390]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.131 --> 00:59:05.071]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.711 --> 00:59:09.673]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.873 --> 00:59:14.015]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.596 --> 00:59:19.877]  Okay, once again, Bob Basie, substituted for Alex Jones.
[00:59:20.257 --> 00:59:23.839]  And he's going to be gone today and gone tomorrow, but he'll be back on Wednesday.
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:33.386]  So until then, you're just going to have to put up with me, the host of the Civil Truth TV Show here in Austin, Texas, which is produced by Jeff Kantoff and Kelly Keller.
[00:59:33.706 --> 00:59:43.532]  I certainly hope that the UN guys aren't going to come to the Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines and arrest me for violating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
[00:59:43.912 --> 00:59:45.913]  I'm just quaking in my boots.
[00:59:46.214 --> 00:59:48.455]  You see, what I'm doing here is I'm trashing the whole thing.
[00:59:49.133 --> 00:59:54.798]  And Article 30 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights tells me I have no right to do so.
[00:59:56.099 --> 00:59:56.400]  Okay?
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:58.722]  There's another document.
[00:59:58.862 --> 01:00:00.303]  There's another one of these things in here.
[01:00:00.783 --> 01:00:02.645]  Another one of these glorious human rights.
[01:00:03.706 --> 01:00:11.353]  It's Article 14, which says that you have the right to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.
[01:00:12.245 --> 01:00:13.006]  So like if the U.N.
[01:00:13.046 --> 01:00:19.870]  was going to come get me, I could run to another country and say I'm a political person and I would like to be protected from the U.N.
[01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:20.931]  because they're persecuting me?
[01:00:21.471 --> 01:00:36.741]  But no, I'm afraid I can't get away with that because Article 14, Section 2 says, this right may not be invoked in the case of prosecutions arising from not from or acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
[01:00:36.821 --> 01:00:38.942]  So, gee, I guess I don't have anywhere to hide.
[01:00:39.182 --> 01:00:40.263]  I guess neither do you.
[01:00:41.075 --> 01:00:41.655]  You understand?
[01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:45.496]  According to Article 14, you oppose the U.N., you have nowhere to hide.
[01:00:45.516 --> 01:00:47.477]  They're going to come after you, and they're going to persecute you.
[01:00:47.497 --> 01:00:48.897]  It says right there in Article 14.
[01:00:49.618 --> 01:00:54.599]  Now, I want to back up a little bit, talking about all these sources of going after the U.N.
[01:00:55.459 --> 01:00:58.140]  I'm a member of the John Birch Society, and I have been for a long time.
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:05.382]  And one of the founding era books of the John Birch Society is the Blue Book of the John Birch Society.
[01:01:06.202 --> 01:01:08.103]  And I want to read a couple of things from the Blue Book.
[01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:13.116]  Having to do with our glorious, wonderful United Nations.
[01:01:13.456 --> 01:01:16.777]  First thing I want to point out is this book was published in 1959.
[01:01:16.817 --> 01:01:17.798]  Okay?
[01:01:18.558 --> 01:01:17.798]  1959.
[01:01:19.278 --> 01:01:27.181]  And of course, Robert Welch, the founder of this society, is responsible for this book.
[01:01:27.661 --> 01:01:32.262]  And I want to read a couple of quotes from the blue book of the John Birch Society.
[01:01:32.342 --> 01:01:32.622]  Okay?
[01:01:33.683 --> 01:01:34.303]  Page 20.
[01:01:34.903 --> 01:01:37.904]  Talking about this communist plan to take over the Earth.
[01:01:39.019 --> 01:02:02.253]  A part of that plan, of course, is to induce the gradual surrender of American sovereignty, piece by piece and step by step, to various international organizations, of which the United Nations is the outstanding but far from the only example, while the Communists are simultaneously and gradually getting complete work and control of such organizations.
[01:02:03.294 --> 01:02:03.954]  So there you have it.
[01:02:06.676 --> 01:02:29.348]  birth society founded going after the UN and here's another little blurb from page 25 talking about how we get involved in these UN sponsored wars and what happens General Mark Clark for instance officially this is about the Korean War General Mark Clark for instance officially reported from Korea quote
[01:02:30.433 --> 01:02:36.358]  We obtained solid evidence that the Communists slaughtered 11,622 members of my U.N.
[01:02:36.398 --> 01:02:39.580]  command while they were defenseless prisoners of war.
[01:02:40.281 --> 01:02:44.984]  These men were tied to their fellow prisoners and transported to previously selected sites.
[01:02:45.765 --> 01:02:50.869]  They were dumped alive into trenches, dug for the purpose, and summarily shot."
[01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:56.493]  About 5,000 of those boys were from your hometowns and mine.
[01:02:57.153 --> 01:03:02.836]  But how many of you ever saw that report in your headlines or anywhere else?
[01:03:05.777 --> 01:03:24.066]  In seeking the first of those two broad objectives, less government and more responsibility, we shall make all the use we can of educational action on the political front.

[01:03:30.221 --> 01:03:33.744]  One world government is automatically contrary to everything we stand for.
[01:03:33.764 --> 01:03:41.490]  And one of the movements we shall oppose with all the strength that we can when they say to get rid of the United Nations.
[01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:43.292]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:43.312 --> 01:03:45.994]  A little ancient history for you back from 1959.

[01:04:56.121 --> 01:04:57.142]  A new world order.
[01:04:57.883 --> 01:05:01.766]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by power.
[01:05:03.403 --> 01:05:10.808]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:05:11.549 --> 01:05:18.895]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:26.903]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[01:05:34.947 --> 01:05:35.707]  They're not after money.
[01:05:35.727 --> 01:05:36.808]  They have all the money they need.
[01:05:36.988 --> 01:05:37.748]  They're after power.
[01:05:37.988 --> 01:05:38.809]  That's what happens here.

[01:06:53.393 --> 01:06:59.115]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:01.076 --> 01:07:05.737]  Yeah, he's the T-Rex of political talk, but he's not here right now.
[01:07:05.777 --> 01:07:11.959]  This is Bob Basie, substituting for the inimitable Alex Jones, who will be back the day after tomorrow.
[01:07:12.939 --> 01:07:20.221]  While we're out plugging things, I wouldn't be remiss if I didn't plug my TV show, which is now available on Google Video.
[01:07:20.501 --> 01:07:29.164]  All you've got to do is go to Google Video, and type in Bob Dacey, last name is spelled D-A-C-E-Y, and then Simple Truth.
[01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:32.865]  And about, I don't know, eight or so of the shows are up.
[01:07:34.312 --> 01:07:57.713]  You can watch them whenever you want and you know now we've gone international so I think that's a great deal thanks to the efforts of Lance Morgan who's a he's a good friend of mine he's doing this all on his own so like I say individual initiative somebody doing something and it's making a difference because I think I have a lot of stuff to say and I've been saying it for years and now we got an international audience potential for it so go to Google Video and
[01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:01.252]  Type in Simple Truth Bob Dacey and watch the stuff.
[01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:04.314]  We're also going to be putting up a website pretty soon, so look out for that.
[01:08:05.335 --> 01:08:10.698]  OK, so also or again, I want to say again, we're going to do a cancer show tonight.
[01:08:12.399 --> 01:08:26.609]  Here on our local TV show, and that's going to be up on Google Video in a couple of days, and you want to watch that because it's a compelling story about someone who survived cancer because they didn't go to Big Pharma, didn't get chemo, didn't get radiation.
[01:08:27.406 --> 01:08:28.827]  And they're alive and well today.
[01:08:29.827 --> 01:08:30.107]  All right.
[01:08:32.008 --> 01:08:34.509]  Back to the United Nations Bash-a-thon.
[01:08:35.670 --> 01:08:42.553]  I am holding in my hand a book called The United Nations Exposed by William F. Jasper of the John Birch Society.
[01:08:42.573 --> 01:08:45.735]  He's also senior editor of the New American Magazine.
[01:08:46.575 --> 01:08:55.099]  Now, what I'm about to go into is one of the main reasons why you should fight the UN with every fiber of your being.
[01:08:56.095 --> 01:09:08.362]  Now, I don't care whether you're a hippie, granola cruncher, redneck, beer guzzler, football-watching person, or you like to go to the ballet, or whatever the heck it is you want to do, or like to do.
[01:09:08.382 --> 01:09:10.383]  It doesn't matter.
[01:09:11.383 --> 01:09:21.068]  This issue transcends all of the false political spectrum, if you're an American and you believe in your Constitution and you believe in your Bill of Rights.
[01:09:22.049 --> 01:09:25.611]  Because one of the chief reasons to oppose the UN scum
[01:09:26.684 --> 01:09:37.330]  Is their vision of your rights, your judicial system, what happens to you when you get in trouble with the law?
[01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:38.431]  All right?
[01:09:39.392 --> 01:09:47.737]  Now this, what I'm going to be talking about right now is a new body that the UN has called the International Criminal Court, the ICC.
[01:09:48.897 --> 01:09:53.000]  And we're going to get into that and explain to you what it's all about.
[01:09:54.341 --> 01:09:54.721]  All right.
[01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:56.282]  Let me read a few quotes here.
[01:09:58.048 --> 01:10:01.909]  This is from Professor Charles Rice from Notre Dame University Law School.
[01:10:03.409 --> 01:10:12.391]  The proposed International Criminal Court repudiates the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence and cancels the 4th of July.
[01:10:13.672 --> 01:10:15.492]  What are the limits on the ICC?
[01:10:16.052 --> 01:10:16.732]  There are none.
[01:10:17.232 --> 01:10:17.912]  It's insane.
[01:10:19.753 --> 01:10:20.413]  And here's another one.
[01:10:21.653 --> 01:10:24.794]  This is from Robert S. McNamara, CFR Filth.
[01:10:25.876 --> 01:10:26.897]  We're good to go.
[01:10:47.037 --> 01:10:49.218]  Robert S. McNamara, you are pathetic.
[01:10:50.198 --> 01:10:58.521]  You are a classic example of CFR, globalist, totalitarian, smiley face trash.
[01:11:01.242 --> 01:11:02.083]  Now, here's another one.
[01:11:02.503 --> 01:11:09.486]  This is from Bill Clinton, member of the Council on Foreign Relations, member of the Trilateral Commission, said this December 31st, 2000.
[01:11:11.932 --> 01:11:17.935]  The United States is tonight signing the 1998 Rome Treaty on the International Criminal Court.
[01:11:19.496 --> 01:11:21.517]  Hey Monica, come over here.
[01:11:23.198 --> 01:11:23.898]  So there you have it.
[01:11:24.579 --> 01:11:29.961]  Bill Clinton is also a traitor to his country.
[01:11:30.662 --> 01:11:31.802]  And there is no doubt about it.
[01:11:31.842 --> 01:11:39.526]  When I get through showing you some of the stuff that's in this ICC document, you will have no choice but to agree with me unless you're a communist yourself.
[01:11:39.546 --> 01:11:40.767]  Alright, here we go.
[01:11:42.069 --> 01:11:43.070]  That's one part.
[01:11:43.911 --> 01:11:48.574]  Now let's talk about some of the ICC components here.
[01:11:49.815 --> 01:11:50.976]  This is from Bill Jasper.
[01:11:51.737 --> 01:11:53.779]  But what about the ICC system itself?
[01:11:54.579 --> 01:12:03.286]  Some of the most egregious threats that are built into the system itself include no right to a trial by jury.
[01:12:04.748 --> 01:12:06.069]  Now think about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:06.549 --> 01:12:07.990]  No right to a trial by jury.
[01:12:08.591 --> 01:12:11.353]  Don't you have that right in your Constitution?
[01:12:12.006 --> 01:12:14.328]  Or you want to trade your Bill of Rights for this garbage?
[01:12:14.849 --> 01:12:15.529]  I don't think so.
[01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:21.094]  You've got no right to a trial by jury anywhere in the UN system.
[01:12:21.434 --> 01:12:21.735]  Alright?
[01:12:21.775 --> 01:12:22.435]  Now think of that.
[01:12:22.535 --> 01:12:23.797]  You want to put up with that?
[01:12:24.918 --> 01:12:25.958]  You want to give that up?
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.220]  I don't think so.
[01:12:29.482 --> 01:12:30.122]  Now here's another one.
[01:12:30.162 --> 01:12:31.503]  No right to a speedy trial.
[01:12:32.044 --> 01:12:37.789]  Well, it seems like in America we don't seem to have a right to a speedy trial anymore, but at least it's on paper we do.
[01:12:38.249 --> 01:12:38.950]  You want to give that up?
[01:12:40.979 --> 01:12:42.860]  So that the UN can have their way with you?
[01:12:44.441 --> 01:12:44.981]  Here's another one.
[01:12:45.801 --> 01:13:03.110]  Judges, prosecutors, and counsel drawn from murderous totalitarian and authoritarian regimes with juridical views completely at odds with Western concepts of law and justice and specifically hateful of America and Americans.
[01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:07.252]  Yeah, yeah, you get in trouble in this system and you have some
[01:13:08.012 --> 01:13:20.061]  Some pathetic judge from Sri Lanka and some piece of garbage judge from Communist China and some scum sucking judge from Bosnia and they're going to be judging your sorry behind?
[01:13:20.081 --> 01:13:22.403]  You want that?
[01:13:22.423 --> 01:13:24.044]  I don't think so.
[01:13:25.465 --> 01:13:26.726]  Here's another one.
[01:13:26.746 --> 01:13:31.769]  No appeal of an ICC decision except to the same ICC court.
[01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:36.493]  So if you get convicted and you appeal, you appeal to the same guy who just convicted you.
[01:13:38.795 --> 01:13:39.756]  Oh man, you gotta love this.
[01:13:40.176 --> 01:13:40.716]  Here's another one.
[01:13:42.397 --> 01:13:47.961]  A person convicted under the ICC may be sentenced to prison anywhere in the world the ICC chooses.
[01:13:49.282 --> 01:13:55.426]  Okay, so, you know, let's go to Mexico where you can get like a, you know, six by eight cell forever.
[01:13:56.667 --> 01:13:58.068]  You know, in the middle of the hot summer.
[01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:14.859]  An ICC prosecutor may decide to bring charges against an individual based on accusations provided by NGOs, such as the ACLU, the Environmental Defense Fund, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, etc.
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.402]  So boy, anybody, just about any NGO can go after you.
[01:14:19.462 --> 01:14:27.707]  NGO, that stands for Non-Governmental Organization, of which there are a lot of them that hover around the UN.
[01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:31.731]  Again, back to Jasper.
[01:14:32.271 --> 01:14:53.963]  In other words, under an ICC regime, an American citizen, whether in the United States or abroad, could be accused of a crime by a member of some militant group, been indicted, extradited, tried, and convicted by prosecutors and judges from North Korea, Zambia, Mongolia, China, Iraq, not Iraq anymore, forget that part.
[01:14:54.003 --> 01:14:58.185]  Well, I guess it would be Iraq, the new Iraq, you know, the free and glorious democratic Iraq.
[01:14:58.933 --> 01:15:03.235]  And now I have the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in my hands.
[01:15:28.903 --> 01:15:35.029]  The reason that I think this thing is pathetic scum is because it is and because it says so in its own words.
[01:15:35.809 --> 01:15:39.633]  All you gotta do to check out what I have to say is just Google it.
[01:15:39.853 --> 01:15:43.336]  Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and print it out and read it.
[01:15:44.838 --> 01:15:45.939]  But I'm gonna make it easy for you.
[01:15:45.959 --> 01:15:52.685]  I'm just gonna excerpt from just a few of the things in this document.
[01:15:54.378 --> 01:15:58.979]  Article 59, Arrest Proceedings in the Custodial State.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:13.104]  A state party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and provisions of Part 9.
[01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:16.085]  Okay, did you hear what I just said?
[01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:19.846]  I said provisional arrest.
[01:16:22.148 --> 01:16:23.389]  Can't you see what that is?
[01:16:23.509 --> 01:16:24.109]  Provisional arrest.
[01:16:24.129 --> 01:16:28.912]  That's like you're going down the road, you know, and a cop pulls you over, says, Get out of the car, boy!
[01:16:29.592 --> 01:16:30.613]  And you say, What'd I do?
[01:16:31.073 --> 01:16:32.133]  Get out of the car, boy!
[01:16:32.514 --> 01:16:35.595]  You're under provisional arrest, boy!
[01:16:35.615 --> 01:16:38.057]  He said, Well, what's provisional arrest?
[01:16:38.157 --> 01:16:40.158]  I'm either under arrest or I'm not under arrest, right?
[01:16:40.358 --> 01:16:41.218]  Well, no, no!
[01:16:41.418 --> 01:16:42.359]  We're under the U.N.
[01:16:42.419 --> 01:16:43.259]  system now, boy!
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:46.041]  You're under provisional arrest there, boy!
[01:16:47.222 --> 01:16:47.942]  What the heck is that?
[01:16:49.643 --> 01:16:51.444]  You can be provisionally arrested.
[01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:53.516]  By this international criminal.
[01:16:53.676 --> 01:16:56.018]  That's when they're too lazy to get all the charges together.
[01:16:56.499 --> 01:17:00.683]  They can slap your sorry butt in jail, and then they'll drum up some charges against you.
[01:17:01.684 --> 01:17:01.944]  Okay?
[01:17:02.865 --> 01:17:03.185]  Come on.
[01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:09.611]  This is not, this is so pathetically un-American, that, I mean, it's hard to describe.
[01:17:09.651 --> 01:17:10.652]  Yeah, can you imagine that?
[01:17:11.312 --> 01:17:16.177]  Under the UN system, you can be provisionally arrested, whatever the heck
[01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:18.090]  That is supposed to mean.
[01:17:18.551 --> 01:17:26.673]  That's article 59 of the Rome Statute of the United Nations International Court of Criminals.
[01:17:27.633 --> 01:17:28.153]  Alright?
[01:17:28.293 --> 01:17:28.773]  That's one.
[01:17:28.793 --> 01:17:29.413]  I like that one.
[01:17:29.433 --> 01:17:31.834]  That's a good one.
[01:17:32.374 --> 01:17:33.174]  But my favorite.
[01:17:33.855 --> 01:17:34.555]  My favorite.
[01:17:35.555 --> 01:17:35.875]  Oh boy.
[01:17:36.755 --> 01:17:42.437]  This, if you are an American, you should go get a vomit bag for this one.
[01:17:43.123 --> 01:17:47.986]  You know, if you're flying an airplane listening to this, go find your vomit bag because you're going to need it.
[01:17:48.807 --> 01:18:03.916]  Because this, I'm not kidding, this next thing I'm going to talk about is the most vile, the most disgusting, the most un-American, the most totalitarian thing I can think of in terms of what's called criminal justice.
[01:18:04.776 --> 01:18:10.420]  Never mind that the prosecutor is an arm of the court, which by the way, according to Madison,
[01:18:11.195 --> 01:18:19.261]  Is the definition of tyranny when you combine these powers into one branch of government?
[01:18:20.342 --> 01:18:22.244]  The definition of tyranny.
[01:18:22.784 --> 01:18:32.752]  What I'm about to read to you in Article 81 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court will make you throw up.
[01:18:33.632 --> 01:18:35.294]  But you can't throw up until after the break.
[01:18:35.474 --> 01:18:39.337]  This is Bob Basie for Alex Jones on the GCN Communications Radio Network.
[01:18:53.967 --> 01:18:57.529]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:18:57.569 --> 01:18:58.090]  are located?
[01:18:58.290 --> 01:19:01.673]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:19:01.913 --> 01:19:06.596]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:19:06.897 --> 01:19:13.842]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas, brewing environmental catastrophes,
[01:19:14.062 --> 01:19:14.703]  We're good to go.
[01:19:30.862 --> 01:19:31.482]  We're good to go.
[01:19:53.901 --> 01:19:55.222]  Ted Anderson from Midas, October 15, 2007.
[01:19:55.282 --> 01:19:58.025]  Gold 758 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $7.81, $1.32, $3.85, $20 for half, $1.92, $60 for quarter.
[01:19:58.065 --> 01:19:58.605]  That's $7.81, $1.32, $3.85, $20 and $1.92, $60.
[01:20:07.873 --> 01:20:10.575]  Hedge funds caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[01:20:10.615 --> 01:20:12.396]  The bond market continues to slump.
[01:20:12.576 --> 01:20:12.876]  J.P.
[01:20:12.916 --> 01:20:15.897]  Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[01:20:15.937 --> 01:20:18.159]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[01:20:18.219 --> 01:20:23.101]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[01:20:23.161 --> 01:20:25.603]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[01:20:25.703 --> 01:20:30.145]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders is skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[01:20:30.485 --> 01:20:30.886]  The U.S.
[01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:35.288]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[01:20:35.368 --> 01:20:37.169]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[01:20:37.589 --> 01:20:40.370]  Economist Rody Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[01:20:40.630 --> 01:20:41.991]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:20:43.431 --> 01:20:47.553]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[01:20:47.633 --> 01:20:47.853]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:47.873 --> 01:20:48.053]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.547 --> 01:20:54.027]  Hi, Ken.
[01:20:54.068 --> 01:20:54.828]  It's Judy again.
[01:20:54.848 --> 01:20:59.392]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[01:20:59.552 --> 01:21:02.674]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[01:21:02.914 --> 01:21:04.776]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[01:21:05.056 --> 01:21:07.138]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[01:21:07.318 --> 01:21:13.422]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[01:21:13.623 --> 01:21:18.927]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[01:21:19.187 --> 01:21:22.049]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:23.090]  Go KenSolar!
[01:21:24.381 --> 01:21:25.922]  Get the best of both worlds.
[01:21:26.322 --> 01:21:31.185]  Solar power for your household essentials and a backup generator all-in-one.
[01:21:31.605 --> 01:21:33.006]  Perfect for hurricane seasons.
[01:21:33.226 --> 01:21:36.828]  No long gas lines, no fumes, and no noise.
[01:21:37.528 --> 01:21:40.210]  Lower your electric bill and be prepared year-round.
[01:21:40.850 --> 01:21:43.172]  Complete solar kits for under $1,200.
[01:21:43.412 --> 01:21:47.514]  See the complete solar power generator kit at KenSolar.com.
[01:21:47.674 --> 01:21:51.516]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[01:21:53.331 --> 01:21:55.452]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:21:55.792 --> 01:21:58.872]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:21:59.112 --> 01:22:03.694]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:22:04.074 --> 01:22:06.674]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:22:07.214 --> 01:22:13.896]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:22:14.356 --> 01:22:19.597]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:21.678]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:22:22.178 --> 01:22:25.479]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:22:26.019 --> 01:22:29.400]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:35.842]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[01:22:36.782 --> 01:22:41.723]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and
[01:22:41.803 --> 01:22:42.184]  Shipping!
[01:22:42.504 --> 01:22:45.410]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now!
[01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:46.031]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:46.452]  That's 888-873-7371 today!
[01:23:04.258 --> 01:23:16.763]  Okay, Bob Dasey, back on the Alex Jones Show, worldwide, nationwide, all over the place, and also rebroadcast right after I get done for 21 hours after I'm off the air.
[01:23:16.803 --> 01:23:27.487]  It's going to be back on the Alex Jones InfoWars.com, so you can click on that and listen to me for 21 hours before I'm back here again tomorrow at 11 o'clock Central Time.
[01:23:28.147 --> 01:23:32.331]  By the way, I'm supposed to plug my hardware store, too, for local people in the local area.
[01:23:32.852 --> 01:23:38.897]  I own the Hardware Store Incorporated, the true-value hardware store in Northwest Austin, at Spicewood Springs Road and 183.
[01:23:38.997 --> 01:23:53.491]  And what you're supposed to do is go over there and buy some stuff from me, you know, like to fix your toilet and whatnot, because, you know, I'm over here playing hooky during the Alex Jones Show, and we've got to send you people over there and come visit and see the most politically incorrect store probably in the United States.
[01:23:54.111 --> 01:23:56.433]  So, we even have the Second Amendment posted on the wall.
[01:23:56.453 --> 01:23:57.674]  I mean, you know, give me a break.
[01:23:58.014 --> 01:24:03.979]  So, anyway, if you're in the neighborhood or you're friends with Austin, go visit the hardware store and buy something from us.
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:10.565]  Like, for example, you can buy Ron Paul yard signs, for example, for only $2, which are, that's what my cost is.
[01:24:11.065 --> 01:24:14.368]  So, you know, we sell them and, you know, we think it's great.
[01:24:14.708 --> 01:24:22.935]  So, anyway, now, let's get back to the subject at hand, which is our all-day-long UN Bash-a-thon.
[01:24:23.991 --> 01:24:36.617]  And I told you before the break that what I'm about to read to you should revulse you so much that you will never ever dare think anything nice about the UN ever, ever in your life again.
[01:24:36.637 --> 01:24:37.077]  Okay?
[01:24:37.597 --> 01:24:41.119]  Now you have to understand, in order to be revulsed from this, you have to know what your rights are.
[01:24:41.759 --> 01:24:42.019]  Okay?
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:52.864]  And in America, when you're tried for a crime, you have a right not to be tried for it over and over and over again until they nail your sorry behind.
[01:24:53.544 --> 01:24:55.586]  It's called the Double Jeopardy Prohibition.
[01:24:56.046 --> 01:25:04.592]  Well, let's read Part 8, Appeal and Revision, Article 81, Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
[01:25:05.993 --> 01:25:10.797]  Appeal against decision or acquittal or conviction or against sentence.
[01:25:12.518 --> 01:25:13.179]  Okay, here we go.
[01:25:16.981 --> 01:25:20.724]  The prosecutor may make an appeal on any of the following grounds.
[01:25:22.285 --> 01:25:22.906]  Did you hear that?
[01:25:23.976 --> 01:25:26.177]  Let me back that up, just in case you didn't hear that.
[01:25:27.838 --> 01:25:30.359]  The prosecutor may make an appeal.
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:34.482]  Okay, so let's get this straight.
[01:25:35.462 --> 01:25:38.384]  You get three judges, and they're going to be looking at you.
[01:25:38.404 --> 01:25:40.345]  You don't get a trial by jury, we already talked about that.
[01:25:41.745 --> 01:25:48.529]  You get three judges, politically appointed, crooked judges from God knows what country, trying your sorry behind.
[01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:56.514]  For a crime against humanity, let's say because you stopped your daughter from getting an abortion or something like that.
[01:25:56.694 --> 01:25:56.915]  Okay?
[01:25:57.835 --> 01:25:58.075]  Alright.
[01:26:00.977 --> 01:26:09.621]  The trial goes on, and for whatever reason, you can't convince, you're able to convince one of the judges that you're not guilty.
[01:26:10.461 --> 01:26:10.721]  Alright?
[01:26:10.961 --> 01:26:13.323]  Because it's only two out of three to convict you in the UN system.
[01:26:13.903 --> 01:26:18.025]  You know, there's no jury, so there's no jury that has to be unanimous.
[01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:20.714]  All it takes to convict you in the U.N.
[01:26:20.754 --> 01:26:21.935]  system is two out of three.
[01:26:22.995 --> 01:26:27.417]  So let's just say you luck out and one of the judges doesn't think you're guilty.
[01:26:28.878 --> 01:26:30.219]  Actually, it takes two of them, doesn't it?
[01:26:30.299 --> 01:26:32.319]  It takes two of them to think you're not guilty.
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:36.481]  Because two out of three, you're in a slammer in, you know, Sri Lanka or somewhere.
[01:26:38.582 --> 01:26:41.364]  Okay, so only one judge thinks you're guilty.
[01:26:43.045 --> 01:26:43.745]  And they rule.
[01:26:44.065 --> 01:26:46.006]  They say, well, American person,
[01:26:47.208 --> 01:26:50.571]  We, the International Criminal Court, find you not guilty.
[01:26:50.992 --> 01:26:51.852]  And you go, Yippee!
[01:26:51.872 --> 01:26:52.273]  Hooray!
[01:26:52.293 --> 01:26:52.753]  I'm getting up!
[01:26:52.813 --> 01:26:53.414]  I'm getting out of here!
[01:26:53.434 --> 01:26:54.495]  And you go, Wait a minute!
[01:26:54.955 --> 01:26:57.538]  The prosecutor stands up and he says, Wait a minute!
[01:26:57.598 --> 01:26:58.458]  Not so fast!
[01:26:59.099 --> 01:27:00.700]  And you go, What do you mean?
[01:27:01.001 --> 01:27:01.962]  You said I'm not guilty!
[01:27:02.022 --> 01:27:03.703]  I'm going home to my family and everything!
[01:27:04.364 --> 01:27:04.904]  No!
[01:27:05.185 --> 01:27:07.046]  Let me just read from Article 81.
[01:27:09.145 --> 01:27:14.890]  Unless the trial chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending an appeal.
[01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:17.252]  Yeah, but what about a non-convicted person?
[01:27:18.272 --> 01:27:23.536]  In case of acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately!
[01:27:23.556 --> 01:27:24.597]  Alright!
[01:27:25.118 --> 01:27:25.318]  Uh-oh.
[01:27:25.818 --> 01:27:27.199]  Subject to the following.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:28.220]  Uh-oh.
[01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:35.486]  Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia, to the concrete risk of flight,
[01:27:36.132 --> 01:27:50.019]  The seriousness of the offense charged, and the probability of success on appeal, the trial chamber, at the request of the prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal.
[01:27:51.519 --> 01:27:53.320]  Okay, you say.
[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:54.541]  Oh good, I'm innocent.
[01:27:54.841 --> 01:27:55.641]  I'm getting out of here.
[01:27:55.941 --> 01:27:57.142]  Wait a minute, boy!
[01:27:58.423 --> 01:28:01.364]  The prosecutor has stood up, and he is saying,
[01:28:02.162 --> 01:28:04.163]  This man is a risk of flight!
[01:28:04.663 --> 01:28:06.423]  And you're saying, yeah, but you just said I wasn't guilty.
[01:28:06.663 --> 01:28:07.223]  I don't care!
[01:28:07.263 --> 01:28:08.724]  This man is a risk of flight!
[01:28:09.444 --> 01:28:12.085]  He has been charged with a serious offense!
[01:28:13.005 --> 01:28:16.446]  And I think I can nail his story behind if we appeal!
[01:28:16.466 --> 01:28:18.386]  So guess what?
[01:28:19.287 --> 01:28:22.328]  They throw you back in jail after you've been acquitted, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:24.508]  Talk about vile!
[01:28:24.548 --> 01:28:28.469]  Can you think of anything more vile and disgusting than that?
[01:28:29.209 --> 01:28:31.310]  Again, this is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones.
[01:28:32.037 --> 01:28:41.985]  We're back in a few.
[01:28:43.606 --> 01:28:44.606]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.626 --> 01:28:46.648]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.668 --> 01:28:50.271]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.601 --> 01:29:01.687]  Hi, this is Jeff Rentsch, and if you're interested in suppressed natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[01:29:02.147 --> 01:29:11.454]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[01:29:11.914 --> 01:29:16.217]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[01:29:16.818 --> 01:29:28.883]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineral-like compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery and arthritis.
[01:29:29.403 --> 01:29:34.325]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[01:29:34.805 --> 01:29:37.306]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound.
[01:29:37.386 --> 01:29:38.166]  And the best part?
[01:29:38.667 --> 01:29:40.147]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[01:29:40.207 --> 01:29:41.928]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[01:29:42.228 --> 01:29:44.169]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[01:29:45.049 --> 01:29:45.390]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:46.172]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:29:54.364 --> 01:29:56.185]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:29:56.345 --> 01:30:01.526]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:30:01.686 --> 01:30:03.047]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:30:03.307 --> 01:30:11.469]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:30:11.689 --> 01:30:17.431]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:30:17.591 --> 01:30:19.372]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:30:19.432 --> 01:30:21.594]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:30:21.634 --> 01:30:26.017]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:30:26.157 --> 01:30:28.279]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:30:28.399 --> 01:30:36.285]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:30:36.345 --> 01:30:36.705]  We're good.
[01:30:53.852 --> 01:30:55.594]  It's not a matter of if, but when.
[01:30:55.974 --> 01:30:59.337]  If it happens, you want to be ready to give your loved ones a fighting chance.
[01:30:59.597 --> 01:31:04.041]  Do not rely on someone else to come through for you at a time when it could be about life and death.
[01:31:04.441 --> 01:31:09.405]  Your best chance is Safe Castle Royal, the premier crisis preparedness buyers club out there.
[01:31:09.765 --> 01:31:16.351]  Members get everything at rock-bottom pricing with at least 20% off everything in our store all the time and free shipping to the

[01:31:24.956 --> 01:31:32.420]  Right now you can join the club for only $10, a one-time lifetime fee that gets you some of the best prices anywhere on preparedness products.
[01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:33.221]  We're good.
[01:32:06.067 --> 01:32:10.370]  OK, Bob Dasey for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:11.770 --> 01:32:13.351]  Again, substituting for Alex Jones.
[01:32:14.152 --> 01:32:16.193]  Before the break, I was about to pop a cork.
[01:32:17.374 --> 01:32:19.955]  I mean, think about it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:20.696 --> 01:32:22.997]  You've got an international court system, a U.N.
[01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:28.040]  international court system, whereby there is no prohibition against double jeopardy.
[01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:43.990]  These guys can try you again and again and again and again until they get two out of three of their sorry crooked communist totalitarian judges that they appoint to nail you.
[01:32:44.010 --> 01:32:47.433]  I mean there is no prohibition against double jeopardy.
[01:32:48.153 --> 01:32:51.415]  After they acquit you they throw your sorry behind in jail.
[01:32:51.435 --> 01:32:52.596]  Do you understand?
[01:32:53.897 --> 01:32:56.939]  How can anybody in the United States of America who values
[01:32:57.737 --> 01:33:08.501]  The Constitution values the Bill of Rights, values your own liberty, your own independence, your own freedom, have anything to do with these scum-sucking pigs!
[01:33:10.342 --> 01:33:11.202]  So what's the solution?
[01:33:11.662 --> 01:33:12.923]  Get out of the United Nations.
[01:33:13.643 --> 01:33:21.166]  Which, of course, is one of the major projects, and always has been since the very inception of the John Birch Society, right?
[01:33:22.226 --> 01:33:22.506]  Okay.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:28.162]  Let's talk about how this applies to you.
[01:33:28.703 --> 01:33:30.744]  Oh, that's just International Criminal Court.
[01:33:30.784 --> 01:33:31.845]  That doesn't apply to me.
[01:33:31.905 --> 01:33:35.108]  That applies to somebody else.
[01:33:35.308 --> 01:33:39.211]  Like, I don't know, Jose Padilla or somebody like that.
[01:33:39.231 --> 01:33:39.932]  That doesn't apply to me.
[01:33:41.193 --> 01:33:44.075]  Well, let's talk about Article 123.
[01:33:44.856 --> 01:33:45.817]  When you want to look at a U.N.
[01:33:45.837 --> 01:33:46.117]  document,
[01:33:50.481 --> 01:33:54.064]  You always go to the back to find some of the nasty stuff that they stick in at the back.
[01:33:54.504 --> 01:33:57.066]  They hope you won't read it because you'd be too bored reading the stuff at the front.
[01:33:58.086 --> 01:34:00.708]  Article 123, Review of the Statute.
[01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:12.216]  Seven years after the entry into force of this statute, the Secretary General of the United Nations shall convene a review conference to consider any amendments to the statute.
[01:34:13.157 --> 01:34:19.662]  Such review may include, but is not limited to, the list of crimes contained in Article 5.
[01:34:20.686 --> 01:34:26.948]  So you see there, it's an open door to expand the list of crimes to whatever the heck they want.
[01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.549]  Alright?
[01:34:29.429 --> 01:34:30.269]  There it is right there.
[01:34:30.349 --> 01:34:32.850]  It's not limited to the list they got now.
[01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:34.231]  They can expand it.
[01:34:35.011 --> 01:34:35.751]  And what do you bet?
[01:34:35.831 --> 01:34:36.391]  They will.
[01:34:37.192 --> 01:34:39.012]  What do you think they stuck that in there for?
[01:34:40.313 --> 01:34:44.074]  And then Article 126, you're talking about whether this is enforced or not?
[01:34:44.934 --> 01:34:47.175]  Article 126, entry into force.
[01:34:49.019 --> 01:35:02.507]  This statute shall enter into force on the first day of the month after the 60th day following the date of the deposit of the 60th instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval, or accession with the Secretary General of the United Nations.
[01:35:03.247 --> 01:35:12.912]  Now in English, what that means is that after the 60th country agrees to this garbage, it applies to all of them, including the United States of America.
[01:35:12.972 --> 01:35:13.813]  That's what they think.
[01:35:15.003 --> 01:35:18.286]  That's what these pathetic, vile vermin at the U.N.
[01:35:18.346 --> 01:35:18.626]  think.
[01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:20.107]  Alright?
[01:35:21.128 --> 01:35:25.932]  So yeah, they think it applies to you whether you think it applies to you or not.
[01:35:27.253 --> 01:35:30.395]  Okay, so there are some good reasons to hate the U.N.
[01:35:30.415 --> 01:35:36.620]  It's because they want to trash your Constitution and your Bill of Rights and throw your sorry behind in jail and never let you out.
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:37.061]  Okay?
[01:35:38.362 --> 01:35:39.423]  Alright.
[01:35:39.583 --> 01:35:40.543]  That should be vile enough.
[01:35:41.184 --> 01:35:43.606]  But let's talk about another topic.
[01:35:44.524 --> 01:35:44.824]  Why?
[01:35:45.485 --> 01:35:48.986]  You should fight the UN with every breath of your body.
[01:35:49.867 --> 01:36:02.633]  I have a book I'm looking at right now, written by William Norman Grigg, who formerly was of the John Birch Society, and I hope will be again one day, called Freedom on the Altar.
[01:36:03.694 --> 01:36:13.959]  And this book talks about what the UN plans for your religion, your Christianity, your Judaism, your children, your family life,
[01:36:14.986 --> 01:36:15.266]  Everything.
[01:36:15.807 --> 01:36:16.047]  All right?
[01:36:16.527 --> 01:36:18.249]  Because they are after it all.
[01:36:18.969 --> 01:36:21.611]  And I cannot go into all of it, but I will go into some.
[01:36:22.012 --> 01:36:22.632]  Just a little bit.
[01:36:22.652 --> 01:36:24.033]  Remember, this is a Bash-a-Thon.
[01:36:24.073 --> 01:36:27.416]  We can't... It'll take me forever to completely bash the U.N.
[01:36:27.436 --> 01:36:28.897]  I just have to hit some of the high points.
[01:36:30.318 --> 01:36:43.369]  Chapter 2 UNESCO School Board of the New World Order United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization Here's a quote from Big Brother
[01:36:44.111 --> 01:36:46.172]  His agent O'Brien in George Orwell's 1984.
[01:36:49.054 --> 01:36:52.675]  When finally you surrender to us, it must be of your own free will.
[01:36:53.416 --> 01:36:56.117]  We do not destroy the heretic because he resists us.
[01:36:56.557 --> 01:36:57.278]  We convert him.
[01:36:57.898 --> 01:36:59.299]  We capture his inner mind.
[01:37:00.179 --> 01:37:00.919]  We reshape him.
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:08.643]  Here's a quote from Bertrand Russell, humanist socialist philosopher and UNESCO advisor.
[01:37:10.484 --> 01:37:11.865]  It may be hoped that in time
[01:37:12.498 --> 01:37:20.362]  Anybody will be able to persuade anybody of anything if he can catch the patient young and is provided by the state with money and equipment.
[01:37:20.963 --> 01:37:31.468]  When the technique has been perfected, every government that has been in control of education for a generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen.
[01:37:33.689 --> 01:37:33.969]  Yes.
[01:37:34.810 --> 01:37:40.513]  And of course, you know what the UNESCO motto is.
[01:37:41.630 --> 01:37:44.151]  Every child is our child.
[01:37:46.291 --> 01:37:51.772]  Simply put, UNESCO was designed to function as both the school board and the propaganda ministry of the New World Order.
[01:37:52.492 --> 01:37:56.813]  Now here's a quote from the Saturday Review, way back in 1952.
[01:37:56.973 --> 01:38:10.036]  If UNESCO is attacked on the grounds that it is helping to prepare the world's peoples for world government, then it is an error to burst forth with apologetic statements and denials.
[01:38:10.811 --> 01:38:11.551]  Let us face it.
[01:38:12.131 --> 01:38:16.412]  The job of UNESCO is to help create and promote the elements of world citizenship.
[01:38:17.273 --> 01:38:22.774]  When faced with such a charge, let us by all means affirm it from the housetops.
[01:38:23.754 --> 01:38:25.975]  So there you have that.
[01:38:27.575 --> 01:38:30.196]  And let's have a few more quotes from these people.
[01:38:32.416 --> 01:38:38.878]  Here are some instructions given at a Congress of Communist Party Educators, excuse me, in 1918.
[01:38:42.458 --> 01:38:45.119]  We must remove the children from the crude influence of their families.
[01:38:45.899 --> 01:38:49.660]  We must take them over and, to speak frankly, nationalize them.
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:56.001]  From the first days of their lives, they will be under the healthy influence of communist children's nurseries and schools.
[01:38:56.962 --> 01:38:59.022]  There they will grow up to be real communists.
[01:39:01.022 --> 01:39:09.104]  Now here is a quote from Dr. Mary Jo Bain, Assistant Secretary of Administration for Children and Families at the U.S.
[01:39:09.144 --> 01:39:11.265]  Department of Health and Human Services.
[01:39:13.157 --> 01:39:15.218]  We really don't know how to raise children.
[01:39:15.819 --> 01:39:22.764]  If we want to talk about equality of opportunity for children, then the fact that the children are raised in families means there is no equality.
[01:39:23.684 --> 01:39:29.028]  In order to raise children with equality, we must take them away from their families and communally raise them.
[01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:33.131]  And of course, UNICEF.
[01:39:33.952 --> 01:39:34.872]  United Nations.
[01:39:34.912 --> 01:39:36.974]  That's the one that does all the trick-or-treating.
[01:39:36.994 --> 01:39:37.414]  Remember that?
[01:39:38.415 --> 01:39:39.215]  Their motto.
[01:39:40.196 --> 01:39:42.858]  Every child is our child.
[01:39:44.301 --> 01:39:46.904]  Yeah, you know, that's another reason I hate the UN.
[01:39:47.405 --> 01:39:58.219]  When I was a little kid, little Bobby Dacey growing up in Austin, Texas on 33rd Street, we would trick-or-treat and the teachers in the school would pass out these little orange boxes.
[01:39:58.979 --> 01:40:04.544]  And they would say, OK, when you go out to Trick or Treat, be sure and say, Trick or Treat for UNICEF!
[01:40:05.064 --> 01:40:12.410]  And take the money and bring it back to school, and we'll be sure that we get it to UNICEF, and that way, it'll be wonderful!
[01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:16.933]  And little Bobby Dacey, that was me, I went out and dutifully Trick or Treated for UNICEF.
[01:40:17.714 --> 01:40:27.542]  I didn't know at the time, this was back in the 60's when I was a little kid, I always went as a skeleton, I didn't know at the time that some of the money that I collected
[01:40:28.126 --> 01:40:32.129]  For UNICEF was shipped to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War.
[01:40:33.009 --> 01:40:33.269]  You know?
[01:40:34.050 --> 01:40:38.252]  When I found that out, I was, I was incensed.
[01:40:38.472 --> 01:40:39.373]  I was revolted.
[01:40:39.833 --> 01:40:41.794]  I was helping Ho Chi Minh!
[01:40:42.955 --> 01:40:44.096]  Hey, and I didn't even know it!
[01:40:44.256 --> 01:40:48.979]  Oh well, that's the glories of UNICEF.
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:52.501]  Now you want to talk about the UN.
[01:40:53.942 --> 01:40:55.443]  Any of you people out there religious?
[01:40:57.179 --> 01:40:58.640]  Christians out there or something, maybe?
[01:40:59.761 --> 01:41:01.282]  Well, they're coming to get you.
[01:41:03.403 --> 01:41:04.444]  The UN's coming to get you.
[01:41:06.205 --> 01:41:07.105]  Here's a couple other quotes.
[01:41:08.066 --> 01:41:15.271]  This is from Gerald Barney, director of the Millennium Institute and former director of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
[01:41:15.291 --> 01:41:17.652]  Oh, those Rockefellers, they're involved in all this garbage.
[01:41:18.453 --> 01:41:20.094]  Biggest traitors in the United States.
[01:41:21.235 --> 01:41:21.675]  Here's a quote.
[01:41:22.856 --> 01:41:29.281]  An internationally famous, highly influential author on sustainable development told me bluntly, religion must die.
[01:41:29.741 --> 01:41:35.146]  It is the fundamental cause of virtually all social, economic, and ecological problems, and much of the violence in the world.
[01:41:37.107 --> 01:41:41.651]  And here is another quote from a globalist theologian by the name of Hans Kahn.
[01:41:43.853 --> 01:41:47.836]  Any form of church conservatism is to be rejected.
[01:41:48.676 --> 01:41:49.337]  To put it bluntly,
[01:41:50.097 --> 01:41:59.967]  No regressive or repressive religion, whether Christian, Islamic, Jewish, or of whatever provenance, has a long-term future.
[01:42:02.129 --> 01:42:10.937]  And here is the AID Chairman J. Brian Atwood speaking to the UN Population Control Conference in Cairo.
[01:42:11.778 --> 01:42:12.539]  Listen to this quote.
[01:42:14.801 --> 01:42:17.523]  We will all be changed by this global discussion.
[01:42:18.024 --> 01:42:20.706]  In time, individuals will change their outlook.
[01:42:21.207 --> 01:42:23.228]  Societies will change their mores.
[01:42:23.949 --> 01:42:27.552]  Religions will interpret their beliefs differently.
[01:42:30.515 --> 01:42:36.680]  I mean, these people, I'm telling you what, we're talking about the UN and their preferred religion.
[01:42:37.389 --> 01:42:42.670]  And what their religion is, if you get it right down to it, is Gaia worship.
[01:42:43.351 --> 01:42:47.272]  It's worship in the rocks and the trees and the stones and the rivers and stuff.
[01:42:47.972 --> 01:43:00.375]  And they believe that any religion that exalts humans over, say, snakes in the grass, is unsustainable.
[01:43:02.136 --> 01:43:02.416]  Okay?
[01:43:02.856 --> 01:43:06.017]  So Christianity in the UN system has no place.
[01:43:06.733 --> 01:43:11.455]  And you won't find any references to God in any of the UN documents.
[01:43:12.116 --> 01:43:18.899]  But their religion that they want to push on everybody is this Gaia worship, this Mother Nature garbage.
[01:43:19.979 --> 01:43:24.101]  And they intend to destroy Christianity.
[01:43:24.721 --> 01:43:25.662]  They tend to take it down.
[01:43:26.562 --> 01:43:28.083]  They absolutely tend to take it down.
[01:43:28.783 --> 01:43:29.924]  Let me read this little blurb.
[01:43:30.644 --> 01:43:32.165]  No Refuge for the Faithful.
[01:43:32.205 --> 01:43:34.886]  This is again from Freedom on the Altar by William Norman Grigg.
[01:43:36.286 --> 01:43:38.348]  The first liberty recognized by the U.S.
[01:43:38.428 --> 01:43:39.929]  Bill of Rights is freedom of religion.
[01:43:41.490 --> 01:43:41.970]  The U.N.'
[01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:54.520]  's founding documents, which are based upon the premise that rights are the conditional gift of the state, offer no similar provision for the protection of individual rights against abuses of the global government or its auxiliaries.
[01:43:55.701 --> 01:43:56.101]  The U.N.'
[01:43:56.081 --> 01:44:00.785]  's concept of religious liberty is purely utilitarian.
[01:44:02.866 --> 01:44:03.186]  All right.
[01:44:05.006 --> 01:44:05.987]  Let me back that up.
[01:44:06.208 --> 01:44:09.011]  I mean, I'm reading from a book from somebody who doesn't like the UN.
[01:44:10.072 --> 01:44:13.276]  Well, have you ever heard of the UN's Earth Charter?
[01:44:14.838 --> 01:44:16.299]  Kumbaya, my Lord.
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:17.281]  Kumbaya.
[01:44:17.821 --> 01:44:25.090]  We can all sit in a circle and chant and talk about Mother Nature and how glorious she is.
[01:44:25.973 --> 01:44:30.176]  And we can glorify the rocks and the lizards and the bushes and the trees and everything like that.
[01:44:30.556 --> 01:44:31.877]  Because that's what the UN says.
[01:44:32.477 --> 01:44:35.759]  At the... I'm holding the Earth Charter in my hand.
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.361]  The Holy Earth Charter.
[01:44:38.401 --> 01:44:39.581]  I have a copy of it right here.
[01:44:39.822 --> 01:44:41.943]  You can go get a copy of it too and read it yourself.
[01:44:42.003 --> 01:44:42.863]  It's full of filth.
[01:44:44.324 --> 01:44:45.405]  The Earth, our home.
[01:44:45.945 --> 01:44:47.326]  The global situation.
[01:44:48.027 --> 01:44:49.087]  The challenges ahead.
[01:44:49.688 --> 01:44:51.889]  Universal responsibility.
[01:44:52.509 --> 01:44:53.290]  And my favorite...
[01:44:55.061 --> 01:44:57.082]  The thing at the back of this piece of garbage is this.
[01:44:58.143 --> 01:45:00.865]  Under the top, under the heading, The Way Forward.
[01:45:02.465 --> 01:45:11.471]  In order to build a sustainable global community, the nations of the world must renew their commitment to the United Nations.
[01:45:13.131 --> 01:45:17.674]  Oh boy, after everything I've been talking about, we're supposed to renew our commitment to the UN,
[01:45:20.131 --> 01:45:29.977]  These kleptocratic, communist, totalitarian, New World Order-promoting, scum-sucking filth, in order to save the planet.
[01:45:31.017 --> 01:45:40.562]  Okay, now, I have an article called, The New World Religion, by William F. Jasper, Senior Editor of the New American, John Birch Society.
[01:45:42.343 --> 01:45:43.344]  Wrote this a while back.
[01:45:44.495 --> 01:45:56.166]  And talking about the Earth Charter and the Earth Summit and all this Kumbaya stuff, where you're supposed to turn yourself into a peasant to save Mother Earth.
[01:45:58.168 --> 01:46:04.633]  If the Earth Summiteers have their way, Johnny and Susie will not be able to pledge allegiance to one nation under God.
[01:46:05.374 --> 01:46:10.639]  But they will be able to pledge to one world under Gaia, that is, Mother Earth.
[01:46:11.235 --> 01:46:28.029]  They will not be allowed to have the Ten Commandments or the Holy Bible in class, but could soon be dying before the pagan Ark of Hope, reading the sacred Timonos books and reverently intoning in the text of the new UN Earth Charter.
[01:46:30.330 --> 01:46:39.678]  Crafted by a conclave of wise persons, headed by former Soviet dictator Mikhail Gorbachev, OK, you got that?
[01:46:41.104 --> 01:46:41.664]  Gorbachev.
[01:46:43.465 --> 01:46:48.526]  It is set to become the holy writ of the UN's new global spirituality.
[01:46:49.447 --> 01:47:00.070]  The charter is intended to become a universally adopted creed that will psychologically prepare the world's children to accept the necessity of world government to save the environment.
[01:47:01.090 --> 01:47:07.172]  It is also an outrageous attempt to indoctrinate your children in the UN's new age paganism.
[01:47:10.216 --> 01:47:11.416]  Here's another quote from this thing.
[01:47:11.656 --> 01:47:20.439]  We seek to increase the participation of young people in utilizing the Earth Charter as a guideline in their work as active agents of change.
[01:47:20.999 --> 01:47:23.420]  That's on their website, the Earth Charter website.
[01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:27.061]  And of course they have these blasphemous symbols.
[01:47:27.101 --> 01:47:27.521]  Here we go.
[01:47:29.461 --> 01:47:38.444]  The venerated charter is housed and transported in the Ark of Hope, a blasphemous mimicry of the biblical Ark of the Covenant.
[01:47:39.116 --> 01:47:46.919]  The Ark of Hope is actually designed to look like the Ark of the Covenant, and its devotees carry it around with worshipful solemnity.
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:50.761]  Accompanying the Charter and the Ark are the Temenos Books.
[01:47:51.561 --> 01:47:53.102]  Now, you don't know what the Temenos Books are.
[01:47:53.122 --> 01:47:55.343]  I bet you, you don't know what the Temenos Books are, do you?
[01:47:55.983 --> 01:47:58.244]  Well, I'm going to tell you what the Temenos Books are.
[01:47:58.684 --> 01:48:00.885]  Quote, this is from Bill Jasper.
[01:48:01.366 --> 01:48:06.948]  A Temenos is a, quote, magical sacred circle where special rules apply
[01:48:09.090 --> 01:48:11.071]  We're good to go.
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:43.088]  My hope is that the Charter will be a kind of Ten Commandments, a sermon on the mouth that provides a guide for human behavior toward the environment in the next century and beyond.
[01:48:43.128 --> 01:48:45.930]  That's what he told the Los Angeles Times.
[01:48:47.712 --> 01:48:56.219]  Now, this is what some of the stuff this text says, this sacred text that they carry around in this thing that looks like the Ark of the Covenant.
[01:48:56.399 --> 01:49:01.624]  And by the way, they sail it around a sailboat sometimes too, you know, because they want to be environmentally friendly and everything.
[01:49:02.236 --> 01:49:13.721]  Here, according to the Charter, we must, quote, recognize that all beings are interdependent and every form of life has value.
[01:49:14.421 --> 01:49:20.024]  And Jasper says, unborn children, of course, are not included in the UN's definition of every form of life.
[01:49:20.704 --> 01:49:24.946]  The Earth Summit 2 documents continue to support the UN's pro-abortion policies.
[01:49:25.106 --> 01:49:25.906]  Well, of course!
[01:49:26.266 --> 01:49:30.568]  You know, I mean, the unborn children aren't alive.
[01:49:31.357 --> 01:49:34.258]  Of course not, but snakes are, and trees are.
[01:49:34.978 --> 01:49:40.861]  Okay, we'll be back in a little bit to finish up this part about the United Nations New World Religion.
[01:49:40.941 --> 01:49:42.341]  This is Bob Denson for Alex Jones.
[01:49:43.241 --> 01:49:45.062]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:45.442 --> 01:49:46.803]  A New World Order.
[01:49:58.411 --> 01:50:03.575]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:50:03.635 --> 01:50:05.056]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:50:05.076 --> 01:50:08.378]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[01:50:08.898 --> 01:50:11.360]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:19.425]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:22.432 --> 01:50:27.435]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:27.896 --> 01:50:31.398]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.758 --> 01:50:34.280]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.461]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.481 --> 01:50:36.241]  They're not after money.
[01:50:36.261 --> 01:50:37.342]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.562 --> 01:50:38.303]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.523 --> 01:50:39.564]  That's what they're after.
[01:50:39.684 --> 01:50:44.247]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:50:44.447 --> 01:50:47.869]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:48.049 --> 01:50:48.549]  Endgame.
[01:50:48.590 --> 01:50:50.691]  Boom prep for global enslavement.
[01:50:51.191 --> 01:50:52.392]  You have been warned.
[01:50:54.153 --> 01:51:03.239]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:03.479 --> 01:51:14.706]  Black quirky elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:15.046 --> 01:51:19.869]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:51:20.009 --> 01:51:20.169]  I think?
[01:51:38.953 --> 01:51:40.736]  Let's get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:51:40.776 --> 01:51:41.637]  Call New Millennium, 888-03-4438.
[01:51:41.657 --> 01:51:41.977]  That's 888-03-4438.
[01:51:42.037 --> 01:51:43.419]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:51:53.075 --> 01:51:55.616]  Hemp, the superfood for you and your family.
[01:51:56.016 --> 01:51:59.298]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[01:51:59.758 --> 01:52:03.200]  Hemp, used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:10.644]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[01:52:10.984 --> 01:52:14.245]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[01:52:14.505 --> 01:52:17.807]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through HempUSA.com.
[01:52:17.807 --> 01:52:18.187]  We're good to go.
[01:52:44.008 --> 01:52:44.248]  Help.
[01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.989]  Shop.
[01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:46.631]  At HempUSA.org.
[01:52:46.832 --> 01:52:47.893]  We do not charge for shipping.
[01:52:47.953 --> 01:52:49.635]  That's 908-691-2608.
[01:52:50.196 --> 01:52:52.539]  Or go to HempUSA.org today.
[01:52:58.205 --> 01:53:00.128]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:00.588 --> 01:53:03.332]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:06.551 --> 01:53:07.792]  Okay, it's Bob Basie.
[01:53:08.272 --> 01:53:09.813]  Substituting again for Alex Jones.
[01:53:09.873 --> 01:53:14.475]  And once again, I'll be here tomorrow, all day long tomorrow, and Alex will be back on Wednesday.
[01:53:15.436 --> 01:53:21.599]  And by the way, while I'm talking about it, Alex will be live at the Alamo Draft House Cinema.
[01:53:21.659 --> 01:53:27.922]  He's going to be there on October the 22nd and on November the 5th in person at the Alamo Draft House Cinema.
[01:53:28.762 --> 01:53:31.323]  And they're going to be playing in game on the big screen there.
[01:53:31.464 --> 01:53:33.925]  So you need to, if you're in the Austin area, you need to
[01:53:35.206 --> 01:53:42.189]  Go to Alamo Draft House website for more details, or I'm sure you can go to Infowars.com and check it out.
[01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:44.530]  OK, because guess what?
[01:53:44.770 --> 01:53:45.451]  They want you dead.
[01:53:45.691 --> 01:53:48.032]  And that's what we're talking about, these UN scum.
[01:53:48.872 --> 01:53:53.594]  We're participating now in our last part of the second hour of our UN Bash-a-thon.
[01:53:54.435 --> 01:53:56.816]  And I was reading from the sacred text.
[01:53:57.802 --> 01:54:05.868]  Of the global whatever earth charter that they have, they carry around like it's the Ark of the Covenant.
[01:54:06.748 --> 01:54:08.810]  Now let's read some more from what the earth charter says.
[01:54:09.851 --> 01:54:13.233]  Adopt at all levels sustainable development plans and regulations.
[01:54:13.653 --> 01:54:18.116]  What that means is this is prescription for global socialism in a super regulated global state.
[01:54:19.397 --> 01:54:24.421]  Internalize the full environmental and social cost of goods and services in selling price.
[01:54:25.709 --> 01:54:32.052]  And Jasper comments, this seemingly harmless sentence would empower the state to price, tax, and regulate all production and consumption.
[01:54:32.852 --> 01:54:33.352]  Here's another one.
[01:54:34.133 --> 01:54:39.475]  Ensure universal access to health care that fosters reproductive health and responsible reproduction.
[01:54:40.616 --> 01:54:41.356]  You know what that means.
[01:54:42.256 --> 01:54:48.079]  And Jasper says, this is a thinly disguised call for socialized medicine that includes abortion and population control.
[01:54:48.499 --> 01:54:49.800]  Of course, that's the end game.
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:53.381]  Again, you need to buy Alex's new film when it comes out.
[01:54:53.441 --> 01:54:55.022]  Go pre-buy it at Infowars.com.
[01:54:56.565 --> 01:54:57.106]  And another one.
[01:54:57.726 --> 01:55:01.770]  Promote the equitable distribution of wealth within nations and among nations.
[01:55:03.291 --> 01:55:06.594]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, that's Marxism.
[01:55:06.654 --> 01:55:08.195]  That's the redistribution of the wealth.
[01:55:08.495 --> 01:55:10.677]  Communist Manifesto 101!
[01:55:11.778 --> 01:55:12.339]  Go figure.
[01:55:12.359 --> 01:55:16.102]  And then, I'll just read one more sentence from Mr. Jasper.
[01:55:16.782 --> 01:55:18.624]  The Charter includes much, much more.
[01:55:18.984 --> 01:55:21.707]  It ends with a stirring exhortation.
[01:55:21.907 --> 01:55:22.147]  Quote.
[01:55:23.027 --> 01:55:43.944]  In order to build a sustainable global community, the nations of the world must renew their commitments to the United Nations, fill their obligations under existing international agreements, and support the implementation of Earth Charter principles with an international legally binding instrument on environment and development.
[01:55:45.265 --> 01:55:46.306]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:46.706 --> 01:55:49.989]  Again, that's the New World Religion.
[01:55:50.449 --> 01:55:51.210]  Gaia worship.
[01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:52.551]  No room for Christianity.
[01:55:53.010 --> 01:55:54.251]  No room for Judaism.
[01:55:54.711 --> 01:56:00.835]  Sorry, you know, your religion isn't sustainable because it doesn't kiss Mother Earth's rear end.
[01:56:01.696 --> 01:56:07.679]  So, that's another reason to bash the United Nations.
[01:56:07.739 --> 01:56:08.420]  I've got more.
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:09.521]  I've got one more big one.
[01:56:09.921 --> 01:56:12.783]  And after I get done with this next one, we're going to be taking phone calls.
[01:56:13.403 --> 01:56:16.485]  The number, oh, in about maybe 10 or 15 minutes, is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:56:16.505 --> 01:56:16.705]  That's 1-800.
[01:56:22.074 --> 01:56:22.514]  2-5-9-9-2-3-1.
[01:56:25.196 --> 01:56:34.281]  After I get done with this last part of my bash-a-thon, we're going to be taking phone calls, and I would invite you to come up with your reasons why you don't like the UN.
[01:56:34.301 --> 01:56:37.542]  You could participate in the bash-a-thon.
[01:56:37.562 --> 01:56:39.943]  We could call this a gang bash, so to speak.
[01:56:40.544 --> 01:56:40.864]  All right.
[01:56:40.944 --> 01:56:46.527]  Now, let's talk about what I'm going to be talking about at the top of the hour.
[01:56:47.754 --> 01:56:52.939]  One of the main things that you really like about the Bill of Rights of the U.S.
[01:56:52.979 --> 01:57:07.994]  Constitution is the fact that we have the right to keep and bear arms in defense of ourselves, our homes, our community, and our country from burglars, thugs, domestic enemies, crooked governments, and foreigners.
[01:57:10.058 --> 01:57:17.028]  When we come back at the top of the hour, we're going to give you yet another reason to hate the United Nations and to get them out of our country.
[01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:19.311]  Bob Dacey for Alex Jones.
[01:57:33.971 --> 01:57:38.266]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.773 --> 01:57:53.956]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.617 --> 01:57:55.437]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.178 --> 01:57:57.079]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.759 --> 01:58:01.422]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.942 --> 01:58:06.026]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.882 --> 01:58:20.388]  All right, it's Bob Dacey back again, substituting for Alex Jones on this third hour of the Alex Jones Show on October the 15th, 2007.
[01:58:21.089 --> 01:58:31.296]  And for the last two hours, I have been unmercifully bashing the United Nations and exposing them for what they are, which is a bunch of smiley face globalist totalitarians.
[01:58:31.756 --> 01:58:33.357]  That's what they are, bottom line.
[01:58:33.737 --> 01:58:39.181]  When you look at the UN, what they are is totalitarianism with a happy face on it.
[01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:40.090]  That's it.
[01:58:40.490 --> 01:58:43.471]  It's the biggest con job on the planet.
[01:58:43.992 --> 01:58:52.835]  And it's brought to you by the members of the Council on Foreign Relations here in the United States who were chiefly responsible for setting that thing up back in 1945.
[01:58:53.555 --> 01:58:58.937]  You know, David Rockefeller's granddaddy and his daddy and David Rockefeller, the whole group of them.
[01:58:59.877 --> 01:59:02.558]  You know, go get the CFR list and read the current membership.
[01:59:02.578 --> 01:59:03.358]  You'll get the picture.
[01:59:04.599 --> 01:59:07.820]  Glorious people like Zbigniew Brzezinski, who's nothing but a Nazi.
[01:59:08.741 --> 01:59:13.184]  And, you know, Henry Kissinger, who's a war criminal, and he's wanted in several countries.
[01:59:13.945 --> 01:59:17.627]  People like that, you know, that's what the CFR is.
[01:59:18.748 --> 01:59:19.949]  They infest the government.
[01:59:19.989 --> 01:59:21.090]  They infest business.
[01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:23.411]  They infest the banking industry.
[01:59:23.451 --> 01:59:27.114]  They infest the educational system we have here at the universities.
[01:59:28.115 --> 01:59:29.956]  You know, they infest just about everything.
[01:59:29.996 --> 01:59:30.856]  They're total scum.
[01:59:31.817 --> 01:59:33.658]  Because they don't believe in individual liberty.
[01:59:33.678 --> 01:59:34.579]  They don't believe in human rights.
[01:59:34.939 --> 01:59:37.221]  Now, again, one of the human rights that
[01:59:38.038 --> 01:59:39.419]  Makes all the rest of them possible.
[01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:42.241]  Is the right to defend yourself.
[01:59:43.042 --> 01:59:46.124]  And the Second Amendment does not grant you anything.
[01:59:46.984 --> 01:59:49.066]  The Second Amendment only enumerates something.
[01:59:49.106 --> 01:59:52.568]  It only lists something you already had by virtue of the fact that you're alive.
[01:59:53.069 --> 01:59:57.432]  You have the right to effective self-defense.
[01:59:58.112 --> 02:00:05.858]  And any government that doesn't recognize your right to protect your very life
[02:00:08.644 --> 02:00:09.845]  Isn't worth anything.
[02:00:11.585 --> 02:00:12.205]  It's your enemy.
[02:00:14.146 --> 02:00:21.889]  So what do you think the United Nations has to say in their glorious Universal Declaration of Human Rights about your right to keep and bear arms?
[02:00:23.010 --> 02:00:24.610]  Well, guess what, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:00:24.630 --> 02:00:26.791]  You won't have to look very far, because it ain't there.
[02:00:27.572 --> 02:00:27.872]  All right?
[02:00:28.392 --> 02:00:31.613]  Now, an example.
[02:00:31.653 --> 02:00:37.856]  Many years ago, many years ago, in 2000, back in the year 2000, I was exploring the UN
[02:00:39.125 --> 02:00:56.457]  Myriad of their websites and I ran into something which Is so vile and so disgusting and so you in that I couldn't resist giving it to Alex Jones And I did and he put this all over the internet.
[02:00:56.597 --> 02:01:05.904]  He talked about it ad nauseum for a long time and You know, this is a you in bashathon and I thought I would dig it up again, even though it's really old back in 2000
[02:01:07.481 --> 02:01:08.142]  I am holding it.
[02:01:08.242 --> 02:01:10.484]  They took this down off their website, by the way.
[02:01:10.524 --> 02:01:11.244]  It's not up there now.
[02:01:12.165 --> 02:01:13.246]  But, you know, I have a copy of it.
[02:01:14.107 --> 02:01:20.092]  What this is, is from a sub-organization of the UN called UNIDIR.
[02:01:21.353 --> 02:01:22.815]  They've got UNI-everything, you know.
[02:01:23.095 --> 02:01:24.656]  UNICEF, you know, all that.
[02:01:26.398 --> 02:01:31.322]  This is the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, okay?
[02:01:32.412 --> 02:01:41.294]  Now, they have a paper, a draft paper, a draft discussion paper that they put on their website to circulate amongst themselves so that they could comment on it worldwide.
[02:01:42.614 --> 02:01:43.874]  Well, I stumbled onto it.
[02:01:44.935 --> 02:02:00.218]  And the title of this draft discussion paper, written by Christoph Karl and Patricia Lewis, Unidir, Geneva, August 2000, the title of this document is
[02:02:01.070 --> 02:02:05.051]  Removing military weapons from civilian hands.
[02:02:06.052 --> 02:02:07.152]  Uh-oh!
[02:02:08.032 --> 02:02:13.574]  You mean like the M1 Garand of World War II that my dad carried when he was in the Marine Corps?
[02:02:14.414 --> 02:02:16.315]  On Okinawa and on Peleliu?
[02:02:17.235 --> 02:02:18.496]  Yeah, that one too.
[02:02:19.116 --> 02:02:28.779]  So when we get back from this break, we're going to explain to you what the UN believes about your right to keep and bear a military-style weapon.
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:32.902]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones as the Bash-a-thon continues.
[02:02:47.344 --> 02:02:51.908]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:02:52.208 --> 02:02:56.311]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:02:56.591 --> 02:02:57.131]  We listened.
[02:02:57.452 --> 02:03:02.435]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:03:02.716 --> 02:03:03.196]  We listened.
[02:03:03.576 --> 02:03:06.619]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:03:07.039 --> 02:03:07.579]  We listened.
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:12.083]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:03:12.483 --> 02:03:12.963]  We listened.
[02:03:13.304 --> 02:03:18.547]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:03:18.948 --> 02:03:20.328]  Again, we listened.
[02:03:20.669 --> 02:03:22.250]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[02:03:22.450 --> 02:03:27.994]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:03:28.454 --> 02:03:31.095]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[02:03:31.296 --> 02:03:31.496]  Only $279.
[02:03:31.556 --> 02:03:36.018]  Call New Millennium, 888-03-4438.
[02:03:36.078 --> 02:03:38.419]  That's 888-03-4438.

[02:03:44.902 --> 02:03:46.343]  It is a big idea.
[02:03:47.384 --> 02:03:48.424]  A new world order.
[02:03:49.144 --> 02:03:53.346]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:03:54.047 --> 02:03:56.168]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:03:59.642 --> 02:04:02.085]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:04:02.826 --> 02:04:10.156]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:18.141]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:04:18.621 --> 02:04:22.102]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:04:22.482 --> 02:04:25.023]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world, doesn't he?
[02:04:25.063 --> 02:04:26.203]  Most people have no idea.
[02:04:26.223 --> 02:04:26.983]  They're not after money.
[02:04:27.003 --> 02:04:28.064]  They have all the money they need.
[02:04:28.284 --> 02:04:29.004]  They're after power.
[02:04:29.264 --> 02:04:30.264]  That's what they're after, you see.
[02:04:30.424 --> 02:04:38.606]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:04:41.907 --> 02:04:43.167]  You have been warned.
[02:04:44.568 --> 02:04:45.728]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[02:04:45.748 --> 02:04:48.129]  I'm the Nutromedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:04:48.269 --> 02:04:51.250]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals, U.S.
[02:04:51.290 --> 02:04:51.990]  is a real thing.
[02:04:52.050 --> 02:04:58.952]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh and never before available garlic.
[02:04:59.072 --> 02:05:04.334]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[02:05:04.514 --> 02:05:05.254]  We're good to go!
[02:05:31.340 --> 02:05:35.042]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[02:05:35.062 --> 02:05:40.145]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[02:05:40.265 --> 02:05:43.067]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:05:45.068 --> 02:05:50.130]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.471 --> 02:05:52.752]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:58.161 --> 02:06:12.672]  Yeah, and there's a war on for your guns, too, ladies and gentlemen, and the people that are trying to take them away from you reside at the United Nations up in New York, because they're a bunch of scum-sucking pigs and sons of a motherless goat.
[02:06:13.413 --> 02:06:16.255]  And actually, there is a statue in front of the U.N.
[02:06:16.315 --> 02:06:23.600]  of what looks like a Colt Python revolver with its barrel tied in a knot, which greatly symbolizes the U.N.'
[02:06:23.580 --> 02:06:25.662]  's intentions for civilian firearms.
[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:28.742]  So, again, we're talking about a U.N.
[02:06:28.782 --> 02:06:34.868]  document I discovered many years ago called Removing Military Weapons from Civilian Hands.
[02:06:36.650 --> 02:06:38.191]  Now, oh, come on now.
[02:06:38.251 --> 02:06:39.893]  People shouldn't have military weapons?
[02:06:39.993 --> 02:06:40.534]  Come on now.
[02:06:40.794 --> 02:06:42.015]  Well, let's see what they think here.
[02:06:42.275 --> 02:06:42.816]  This is funny.
[02:06:43.516 --> 02:06:45.198]  Let me just excerpt from this document.
[02:06:45.698 --> 02:06:50.363]  The focus of the campaign is on what is needed rather than what is thought to be politically possible.
[02:06:51.078 --> 02:06:52.419]  In other words, yeah, we need to do this.
[02:06:52.739 --> 02:06:55.281]  We need to take these guns away from civilians all over the world.
[02:06:55.681 --> 02:06:58.803]  Although right now, it's not politically possible.
[02:06:59.664 --> 02:07:07.509]  And later on, they ask the people that are reading this thing, please do not cite it in its draft form or quote from it as it now stands.
[02:07:07.809 --> 02:07:08.710]  Well, you know what?
[02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:09.751]  I just ignored that.
[02:07:09.791 --> 02:07:11.132]  I gave it to Alex Jones.
[02:07:11.552 --> 02:07:12.272]  Oh, man.
[02:07:12.993 --> 02:07:14.214]  Oh, I shouldn't have done that.
[02:07:14.254 --> 02:07:17.836]  I'm going to get arrested by them United Nations people and thrown in the slammer.
[02:07:17.856 --> 02:07:20.278]  And when they don't convict me, they won't keep me there.
[02:07:21.388 --> 02:07:22.349]  Okay, listen to this sentence.
[02:07:23.869 --> 02:07:26.231]  This is how these people don't even know anything about guns.
[02:07:26.291 --> 02:07:27.952]  It's funny, they contradict themselves.
[02:07:29.172 --> 02:07:31.814]  These weapons are made for war.
[02:07:32.454 --> 02:07:37.137]  They have been designed to be used by trained military personnel.
[02:07:37.937 --> 02:07:45.482]  So you get the idea here that these weapons they're talking about are very, very specialized, very sophisticated weapons.
[02:07:45.562 --> 02:07:47.983]  It says right there, they have been designed to be used
[02:07:48.803 --> 02:07:51.585]  By trained military personnel.
[02:07:52.366 --> 02:07:57.370]  And then a few sentences later they say, These weapons require very little skill and training to use.
[02:07:57.570 --> 02:07:58.111]  Oh, come on!
[02:07:58.171 --> 02:07:59.332]  Make up your mind, guys!
[02:07:59.832 --> 02:08:01.433]  You know, well, the second sentence is true.
[02:08:01.493 --> 02:08:03.635]  You know, AK-47, that stuff, pretty easy.
[02:08:04.416 --> 02:08:04.936]  Okay.
[02:08:05.437 --> 02:08:07.618]  Now here's the kicker, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:08.419 --> 02:08:16.425]  This sentence sums up UN philosophy on your human right to defend yourself.
[02:08:18.167 --> 02:08:18.387]  Alright?
[02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:27.796]  Such weapons make it harder for the state to regain the legitimate monopoly of force.
[02:08:29.617 --> 02:08:31.679]  I'm going to read that again, just in case you were asleep.
[02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:41.047]  Such weapons make it harder for the state to regain the legitimate monopoly of force.
[02:08:41.468 --> 02:08:42.829]  There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:43.470 --> 02:08:44.891]  These pathetic, vile
[02:08:46.161 --> 02:08:55.945]  Bile-infested putrid creatures at the UN believe that state monopoly of force is how you should be, where you should go.
[02:08:56.265 --> 02:08:57.225]  This is what we need.
[02:08:57.825 --> 02:09:01.426]  They promote state monopoly of force.
[02:09:01.847 --> 02:09:05.708]  That is the antithesis of everything American.
[02:09:07.557 --> 02:09:08.498]  Do you hate the U.N.
[02:09:08.558 --> 02:09:08.798]  now?
[02:09:08.838 --> 02:09:10.099]  Do you still like the U.N.?
[02:09:10.519 --> 02:09:16.723]  They think that the crooked, pathetic, communist, totalitarian state should have all the guns!
[02:09:20.046 --> 02:09:21.787]  This is their own words, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:23.568 --> 02:09:26.490]  State monopoly of force is a good thing.
[02:09:27.611 --> 02:09:30.633]  And then they go on to describe how to go about taking all these guns away.
[02:09:30.653 --> 02:09:34.836]  They talk about banning sales to people that aren't states.
[02:09:35.942 --> 02:09:39.685]  You know, breaking the chain, destroying all these weapons they can get a hold of.
[02:09:39.745 --> 02:09:44.047]  They talk about ammunition control, you know.
[02:09:44.087 --> 02:09:47.009]  Well, gee, maybe we'll just go after those bullets.
[02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:51.232]  I mean, what good's the gun if we don't let you buy the bullets?
[02:09:51.812 --> 02:09:54.975]  And then they talk about their civil society campaign.
[02:09:55.015 --> 02:09:56.115]  There you go.
[02:09:56.135 --> 02:09:59.377]  We're going to propagandize the people into giving up their guns.
[02:09:59.958 --> 02:10:04.561]  And in that segment of this document, they say this.
[02:10:06.937 --> 02:10:15.365]  If a concerted campaign were to be formed to remove such weapons from civilian hands, this would have a number of distinct advantages.
[02:10:17.367 --> 02:10:18.668]  And here are two of them.
[02:10:20.490 --> 02:10:24.974]  It would be hard for the anti-control lobby to argue against such an initiative.
[02:10:25.652 --> 02:10:37.016]  After all, who could easily justify the right for civilians to bear arms built for military purposes and thus argue taking automatic and semi-automatic weapons off the streets?
[02:10:37.916 --> 02:10:44.359]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, there you have what they're talking about as their definition of military weapons.
[02:10:44.819 --> 02:10:45.579]  Semi-automatic.
[02:10:46.659 --> 02:10:48.920]  Your granddad's M1 Garand.
[02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:50.901]  Your Ruger 10-22.
[02:10:50.981 --> 02:10:51.221]  Your Glock.
[02:10:55.552 --> 02:10:56.373]  You're whatever.
[02:10:56.633 --> 02:10:57.874]  Semi-automatic.
[02:10:58.415 --> 02:11:01.077]  That means when you pull the trigger, a bullet comes out.
[02:11:01.477 --> 02:11:04.440]  And you pull the trigger again, another bullet comes out.
[02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:10.725]  They want to ban semi-automatic weapons and classify them as military style.
[02:11:11.406 --> 02:11:13.407]  This is their words, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:13.688 --> 02:11:17.251]  This is their own document on the UN Disarmament website.
[02:11:17.451 --> 02:11:17.891]  UNIDIR.
[02:11:19.172 --> 02:11:19.452]  Back in 2000.
[02:11:19.492 --> 02:11:19.853]  And notice,
[02:11:22.811 --> 02:11:28.635]  Who could easily justify the right for civilians to bear arms built for military purposes?
[02:11:28.956 --> 02:11:35.921]  Well, how about the Second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America, you scum-sucking pigs?
[02:11:36.581 --> 02:11:37.202]  How about that?
[02:11:37.722 --> 02:11:39.323]  How about our Bill of Rights?
[02:11:39.944 --> 02:11:46.729]  This document, ladies and gentlemen, is a direct assault on the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution.
[02:11:47.822 --> 02:11:49.323]  You still think the U.N.
[02:11:49.703 --> 02:11:57.207]  is a nice baby blue organization with little white wheat stalks going up the side with a nice globe in the middle?
[02:11:57.527 --> 02:11:58.067]  No, they're not!
[02:11:58.127 --> 02:12:01.949]  They're a bunch of totalitarian control freaks out to disarm you!
[02:12:05.231 --> 02:12:07.452]  Again, this is their own words.
[02:12:07.913 --> 02:12:09.533]  Their own documents.
[02:12:10.114 --> 02:12:13.756]  So, now, I'm going to put out the phone number again.
[02:12:13.776 --> 02:12:14.296]  It's 1-800
[02:12:16.766 --> 02:12:17.006]  259-9231.
[02:12:17.166 --> 02:12:26.349]  And for the rest of the show, we're going to take phone calls and see if anybody else wants to participate in our UN Bash-a-thon.
[02:12:26.689 --> 02:12:28.090]  I mean, look at these people!
[02:12:28.650 --> 02:12:30.051]  They want to take over the ocean.
[02:12:30.251 --> 02:12:32.211]  They want to take over all the resources there.
[02:12:32.592 --> 02:12:38.474]  You know, they want to have a court system where you don't have a right to a trial by jury.
[02:12:38.494 --> 02:12:42.155]  They want to be able to try you as many times as they want to until they convict you.
[02:12:42.717 --> 02:12:45.078]  You know, they want to get rid of Christianity.
[02:12:45.098 --> 02:12:46.159]  They want to take away your guns.
[02:12:46.339 --> 02:12:48.880]  What is your problem if you don't want to fight these people?
[02:12:51.121 --> 02:12:53.782]  You know, everything I've got here is UN documents.
[02:12:53.802 --> 02:12:56.163]  This is UN stuff I've got here all over the place.
[02:12:56.903 --> 02:12:58.864]  This UN Earth Charter.
[02:12:59.284 --> 02:13:01.945]  This UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
[02:13:02.006 --> 02:13:03.786]  It's all stuff you can see.
[02:13:03.826 --> 02:13:07.848]  This UN paper on removing weapons from civilian hands.
[02:13:07.908 --> 02:13:09.209]  It's all UN stuff.
[02:13:09.249 --> 02:13:12.050]  That's the way you go after the UN is you attack them with their own garbage.
[02:13:14.284 --> 02:13:18.248]  So, John in Ohio, are you there, John?
[02:13:35.194 --> 02:13:37.276]  To claim that the U.N.
[02:13:37.336 --> 02:13:47.406]  is the real threat here because it's a toothless entity that is really 90% controlled through the Security Council by the Anglo-American Military-Industrial Complex.
[02:13:47.906 --> 02:13:48.647]  And who is that?
[02:13:49.247 --> 02:13:50.929]  Well, that's Bush.
[02:13:51.249 --> 02:13:53.972]  Bush-Reagan.
[02:13:54.052 --> 02:13:57.395]  The oil companies, the Military-Industrial Complex, Blair.
[02:13:57.495 --> 02:13:58.196]  And who runs them?
[02:13:59.371 --> 02:14:03.174]  I believe that it is the Wall Street Banks, the Military Industrial Complex.
[02:14:03.194 --> 02:14:04.175]  Yeah, you got it!
[02:14:04.315 --> 02:14:05.155]  And who runs them?
[02:14:05.215 --> 02:14:06.576]  It's the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:14:06.856 --> 02:14:07.817]  Well, very much so.
[02:14:07.837 --> 02:14:08.838]  The Trilateral Commission.
[02:14:08.878 --> 02:14:11.299]  But these guys are rabidly anti-Communist.
[02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:13.281]  It has nothing to do with Communism.
[02:14:13.321 --> 02:14:15.502]  And when the United States can use the U.N.
[02:14:15.582 --> 02:14:20.245]  as a fable leaf to justify the first Gulf War, they trump it all over.
[02:14:20.265 --> 02:14:23.408]  When they can't, they just simply cut them, simply kick it aside.
[02:14:23.628 --> 02:14:25.369]  Who is rabidly anti-Communist?
[02:14:27.005 --> 02:14:34.070]  The military industrial complex that runs this country and the world... Do you think Rockefeller is anti-communist?
[02:14:34.430 --> 02:14:34.891]  Absolutely.
[02:14:34.931 --> 02:14:39.074]  Kissinger killed 4 million people in Vietnam.
[02:14:39.134 --> 02:14:44.098]  He killed scores of thousands in Chile, overthrowing the democratically elected government there.
[02:14:44.358 --> 02:14:51.084]  Communism is only a word, a chapter, a version of totalitarianism.
[02:14:51.384 --> 02:14:55.368]  All these guys are totalitarians, whether you think they're from the right or from the left.
[02:14:55.648 --> 02:14:57.049]  They're all totalitarians.
[02:14:57.389 --> 02:15:02.354]  Well, I think that's a mushy word because... Totalitarian is a mushy word?
[02:15:02.414 --> 02:15:02.774]  How do you figure?
[02:15:02.794 --> 02:15:10.821]  Because I think it obscures the fact that the United... For instance, organizations like the John Bridges Society, you could look it up on Google.
[02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:12.981]  I'll tell you who the John Birch Society spied on.
[02:15:13.001 --> 02:15:16.102]  I'll tell you the truth about that.
[02:15:16.122 --> 02:15:16.943]  John, hang on just a minute.
[02:15:17.003 --> 02:15:18.703]  Let me go ahead and do this.
[02:15:18.883 --> 02:15:20.004]  Keep him on the line.
[02:15:36.371 --> 02:15:38.652]  Let me tell you who the John Birch Society spied on.
[02:15:38.972 --> 02:15:45.195]  You know, the Birch Society has been attacking the New World Order more than anybody, longer than anybody, and more effectively than anybody.
[02:15:45.215 --> 02:15:49.637]  I mean, they were founded to attack the New World Order, globalism, and the whole nine yards.
[02:15:49.937 --> 02:15:54.800]  And, of course, as a result, lies have been spewed about them for decades and centuries almost.
[02:15:54.820 --> 02:15:56.320]  Well, not centuries, but since 1958.
[02:15:57.788 --> 02:16:06.030]  When the society was founded, they had been attacked vociferously by the Rockefellers and the false conservatives and the false liberals, all of whom were totalitarians.
[02:16:06.410 --> 02:16:07.770]  Let me tell you how... This is documented.
[02:16:07.810 --> 02:16:08.630]  This is documented.
[02:16:08.830 --> 02:16:10.210]  Yeah, documented by who?
[02:16:10.250 --> 02:16:11.711]  Let me, let me... It's documented.
[02:16:11.811 --> 02:16:12.951]  Okay, hang on just a minute.
[02:16:12.971 --> 02:16:13.971]  I got the microphone here.
[02:16:13.991 --> 02:16:16.391]  See, I can shut you off whenever I want to because I want to talk right now.
[02:16:16.851 --> 02:16:22.733]  Listen, I'll give you an example of what the John Birch Society, how they colluded with the United States government.
[02:16:23.273 --> 02:16:24.313]  Way back in the early 60s,
[02:16:26.035 --> 02:16:31.597]  There was a preacher that was a member of the John Birch Society who did work for the FBI.
[02:16:31.777 --> 02:16:33.297]  And this is where all these rumors came from.
[02:16:33.337 --> 02:16:34.477]  But I want to tell you the truth about it.
[02:16:34.937 --> 02:16:36.438]  He did work for the FBI.
[02:16:37.018 --> 02:16:41.359]  And he was involved with the Mississippi Klan.
[02:16:41.399 --> 02:16:47.741]  He joined the Klan in order to get close to the head Klan guy in Mississippi back in the early sixties.
[02:16:47.981 --> 02:16:53.242]  Because they were trying to get the goods on the Klan, which is why the Birch Society
[02:16:54.043 --> 02:16:55.144]  We're good to go.
[02:17:17.418 --> 02:17:18.038]  And guess what?
[02:17:18.158 --> 02:17:25.002]  Because of this Birch Society member, that guy, after about the third time they tried to try him in Mississippi, was convicted.
[02:17:25.282 --> 02:17:28.823]  And then right after the Birch Society, like nobody's business.
[02:17:29.644 --> 02:17:33.786]  Alright, after the break I'm going to bring John back here because he seems to be a little misinformed.
[02:17:34.026 --> 02:17:36.227]  This is Bob Dacey on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:46.098 --> 02:17:54.442]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.

[02:18:46.140 --> 02:18:49.802]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:18:50.202 --> 02:18:55.624]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:18:56.105 --> 02:18:57.185]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:18:57.205 --> 02:19:01.247]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:19:01.907 --> 02:19:15.231]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metals holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:19:15.251 --> 02:19:21.032]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:19:21.312 --> 02:19:27.194]  Whether you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:19:45.858 --> 02:19:48.259]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.899 --> 02:19:53.860]  Are radical Islamic nations seeking to gain control of the Security Council of the United Nations?
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:56.320]  What would be their purpose for doing so?

[02:20:18.736 --> 02:20:22.617]  Did you know that the prophecies of the Bible are far in advance of today's news?
[02:20:23.217 --> 02:20:26.458]  It discusses a coming economic system called the Mark of the Beast.

[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:33.540]  Call now.
[02:20:45.689 --> 02:20:48.610]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:20:48.770 --> 02:20:53.951]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:20:54.311 --> 02:20:59.572]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:20:59.992 --> 02:21:01.133]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:01.493 --> 02:21:10.415]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:21:10.675 --> 02:21:10.795]  Yes!
[02:21:10.815 --> 02:21:12.437]  Now compare Calben Pure Soap.

[02:21:39.316 --> 02:21:40.676]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[02:21:56.276 --> 02:22:22.067]  Before the break I was discussing with John who was making an attack on the Birch Society and I was defending the society and what I had said was that it's well documented in a book called Clandestine that a member of the John Birch Society was chiefly responsible for the conviction of Byron De La Beckwith in the murder
[02:22:22.993 --> 02:22:23.494]  Of course.
[02:22:44.008 --> 02:22:46.910]  I think he had something to do with discovering who killed those three students.
[02:23:01.258 --> 02:23:04.540]  And boy, the Birch Society caught it from the so-called right back then.
[02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:06.001]  Okay, John, you're back on.
[02:23:06.021 --> 02:23:08.482]  What else do you have to add to our discussion?
[02:23:08.883 --> 02:23:10.143]  You don't want to help me bash the U.N.
[02:23:10.163 --> 02:23:10.403]  today?
[02:23:11.064 --> 02:23:17.688]  I'll bash them because I think they've been too much a tool of the United States warmongers too often.
[02:23:18.528 --> 02:23:23.811]  All the way from Korea when they served as a fig leaf for killing millions in Korea down to the President.
[02:23:23.831 --> 02:23:31.395]  Whatever they don't do, the United States just kicks them aside contentiously and says, well, you're useless.
[02:23:31.796 --> 02:23:35.078]  And when they do, they say, well, see, it's the international community.
[02:23:35.158 --> 02:23:36.879]  It's not us that are attacking these countries.
[02:23:37.799 --> 02:23:40.360]  They're really nothing but a tool of the warmongers in this country.
[02:23:40.700 --> 02:23:42.381]  But I wasn't talking about this.
[02:23:42.441 --> 02:23:57.487]  I was talking about the Birch Society's ties to the Reinhold Galen Nazi Network in Germany, where John McManus set up a western gold branch of spy with the Reinhold Galen Nazi Network that was brought into the CIA after the Second World War.
[02:23:57.527 --> 02:23:59.168]  I was talking about their connection to the world.
[02:23:59.928 --> 02:24:08.936]  I'm not going to let you spout all these lies on this show.
[02:24:08.976 --> 02:24:09.777]  You're gone, buddy.
[02:24:10.598 --> 02:24:14.621]  You know, the thing about the Burke Society that I'm going to have to say, this is it.
[02:24:15.221 --> 02:24:19.265]  I'll listen to all these people that just love to bash the Burke Society.
[02:24:19.325 --> 02:24:19.885]  Why do they do it?
[02:24:20.286 --> 02:24:26.171]  Because we are the most effective anti-totalitarian organization in the United States of America, and the oldest.
[02:24:26.812 --> 02:24:29.894]  You know, you can judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:24:30.574 --> 02:24:41.621]  We, you know, if the Birch Society is some evil communist plot to help the New World Order, then boy, they sure screwed it up because we are kicking the New World Order's tail right now.
[02:24:42.501 --> 02:24:42.842]  You know?
[02:24:43.782 --> 02:24:47.505]  You go through Birch Society literature, everything they've done, I've done it for years!
[02:24:47.945 --> 02:24:50.867]  For years and years and years and years.
[02:24:51.487 --> 02:24:55.769]  And I've heard all this nonsense and, you know, look what we're doing.
[02:24:57.265 --> 02:24:58.946]  Look what we're doing, you know?
[02:24:59.746 --> 02:25:19.132]  Speaking of which, John McManus is going to be on the show tomorrow from 12 to 1 discussing some of our latest efforts to destroy the New World Order, specifically the North American Union, by informing Americans all over this country about what's going on and spurring them into action.
[02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:24.181]  So, you know, judge a fruit by its trees, not by its detractors.
[02:25:24.621 --> 02:25:30.823]  I've always said this, this is a common thing, you know, and it relates to the Birch Society, it relates to everything.
[02:25:32.083 --> 02:25:46.147]  If you're in a debate and all you've got is, you don't have the facts on your side, and you don't have the law on your side, all you can do is trash your opponent.
[02:25:47.488 --> 02:25:48.108]  That's all you can do.
[02:25:49.395 --> 02:25:51.056]  No facts, no law, trash your opponent.
[02:25:51.837 --> 02:25:55.459]  The Birch Society has all the facts, and they have all the law.
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:59.162]  And so in order to attack the Birch Society, you have to trash them.
[02:25:59.642 --> 02:26:06.607]  And so they've been that a long time, and I know they're no stranger to being trashed by half-truths and falsehoods and all that stuff.
[02:26:07.947 --> 02:26:11.410]  And I know Alex, for example, is no stranger to being trashed.
[02:26:12.410 --> 02:26:15.452]  You know, people trash him up one side, down the other.
[02:26:16.073 --> 02:26:19.175]  But you know, you know the tree by its fruit.
[02:26:20.317 --> 02:26:32.922]  And Birch Society, again, just the longest running track record of effective assault against this New World Order crowd that there is.
[02:26:34.083 --> 02:26:49.729]  And Alex Jones, as far as I'm concerned, this is my opinion, and I'm sitting here in this command chair in the Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines here in Central Texas, Alex Jones, as an individual person,
[02:26:51.014 --> 02:27:01.298]  Is the number one individual person, I believe, who has been responsible in the last decade for exposing the New World Order.
[02:27:03.279 --> 02:27:06.701]  The Birch Society and Alex do not share tactics.
[02:27:07.581 --> 02:27:12.923]  You know, they don't operate the same way, but they're in the same Navy and they're attacking the same enemy.
[02:27:13.643 --> 02:27:17.445]  One's a PT boat commander and the other one is a fleet admiral, but it's the same thing.
[02:27:18.326 --> 02:27:24.671]  So, anyway, when we get back, we're going to go to William and Tim and Seth, and right after this break.
[02:27:28.014 --> 02:27:30.256]  We're on the march.
[02:27:30.816 --> 02:27:32.978]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:33.018 --> 02:27:34.539]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.916 --> 02:27:48.298]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[02:27:48.818 --> 02:27:50.299]  After a pedicure they look great.
[02:27:50.639 --> 02:27:54.482]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[02:27:54.922 --> 02:27:57.104]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[02:27:57.544 --> 02:28:00.887]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:28:01.287 --> 02:28:03.749]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:28:04.249 --> 02:28:05.290]  What's that name again?
[02:28:05.690 --> 02:28:06.871]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:28:07.251 --> 02:28:08.412]  It's CalX.
[02:28:08.832 --> 02:28:10.673]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[02:28:11.014 --> 02:28:12.855]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[02:28:13.641 --> 02:28:22.263]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:28:22.683 --> 02:28:28.405]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[02:28:28.785 --> 02:28:39.908]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:28:40.569 --> 02:28:41.670]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[02:28:42.011 --> 02:28:42.691]  I'll be right back.
[02:28:42.812 --> 02:28:44.553]  I'm getting some Calix for my heels.
[02:28:45.695 --> 02:28:47.236]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.

[02:29:45.251 --> 02:29:50.738]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:51.178 --> 02:29:55.403]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:55.824 --> 02:30:02.692]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:03.112 --> 02:30:09.818]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:10.138 --> 02:30:11.759]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:30:12.059 --> 02:30:15.242]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:15.522 --> 02:30:16.723]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:16.983 --> 02:30:17.964]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:30:18.284 --> 02:30:25.010]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:30:32.235 --> 02:30:33.996]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[02:30:54.164 --> 02:30:58.253]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[02:31:00.174 --> 02:31:12.000]  Yeah, and it actually will be renamed Texaco if we don't do something about it and stop this North American Union because
[02:31:28.909 --> 02:31:39.760]  My globalist elitist friends, like the Rockefellers and what not, are planning to merge the United States, Canada and Mexico into one big happy country.
[02:31:40.561 --> 02:31:41.863]  And we're going to stop them.
[02:31:42.743 --> 02:31:45.086]  The John Birch Society is going to help stop them.
[02:31:45.606 --> 02:31:47.368]  Alex Jones is going to help stop them.
[02:31:51.476 --> 02:31:52.997]  That made me think about a few things.
[02:31:53.177 --> 02:32:00.762]  The fact of the matter is that Alex Jones and the John Birch Society don't always get along.
[02:32:01.163 --> 02:32:02.624]  They do not share tactics.
[02:32:02.664 --> 02:32:04.285]  They don't fully understand each other.
[02:32:04.325 --> 02:32:04.845]  That's fine.
[02:32:04.925 --> 02:32:06.466]  Whatever.
[02:32:09.068 --> 02:32:11.289]  Alex Jones was the guy that woke me up.
[02:32:11.810 --> 02:32:12.891]  He was the guy that woke me up in 1998.
[02:32:13.551 --> 02:32:15.092]  I was kicking and screaming.
[02:32:15.112 --> 02:32:16.353]  I didn't want to believe any of his stuff.
[02:32:17.170 --> 02:32:20.872]  But the documentation was so, so, so irrefutable.
[02:32:21.212 --> 02:32:25.315]  And that documentation came mostly from the John Birch Society.
[02:32:26.255 --> 02:32:29.597]  And so, you know, I'm not wild and bombastic like Alex is.
[02:32:29.637 --> 02:32:32.239]  I'm pretty cool, calm, and collected most of the time.
[02:32:33.419 --> 02:32:34.660]  I looked into the Birch Society.
[02:32:34.700 --> 02:32:39.983]  I thought they were a bunch of crazy rock extremist wackos because I've been hearing all this garbage about them for all these years.
[02:32:41.023 --> 02:32:49.348]  But when I looked into their stuff, their work, their literature, their claims, their documentation, their proof, it was all rock-solid!
[02:32:50.829 --> 02:32:53.350]  And I thought, well, gee, huh.
[02:32:53.930 --> 02:33:02.955]  And so I joined the Birch Society about nine years ago to be the vehicle that I chose to help fight the New World Order.
[02:33:04.436 --> 02:33:04.817]  And, you know,
[02:33:06.946 --> 02:33:20.493]  Misunderstandings or disputes on tactics and what not, notwithstanding, you know, Alex Jones and John Burchesside are on the same side, and they're both very effective players in a very critical war.
[02:33:21.414 --> 02:33:23.315]  And I just happen to be in both camps.
[02:33:24.155 --> 02:33:27.217]  Okay, we've got William in Missouri up next.
[02:33:27.297 --> 02:33:28.097]  William, are you there?
[02:33:29.778 --> 02:33:30.359]  I am here.
[02:33:30.479 --> 02:33:31.339]  Hey, William, how you doing?
[02:33:31.579 --> 02:33:34.021]  I'm doing very well, Bob, and a good broadcast today.
[02:33:34.221 --> 02:33:34.521]  Thank you.
[02:33:34.855 --> 02:33:40.781]  One of the things that I want to thank you for and commend you for is the way that you stick with the documentation.
[02:33:40.841 --> 02:33:45.165]  It's something that I've done since I got involved in all of this many years ago.
[02:33:45.886 --> 02:33:55.375]  And today, the Texaco song there that you just played was a good segue back away from some of the many other valuable topics that you brought up.
[02:33:55.855 --> 02:33:58.338]  But what I wanted to share with the audience and you
[02:33:59.088 --> 02:34:06.011]  is a body of research, a book, that can be acquired from the United Nations publications UNP.UN.org.
[02:34:06.471 --> 02:34:12.873]  It's called the Compendium of Recommendations on International Migration and Development.
[02:34:13.154 --> 02:34:19.516]  And it's the United Nations Development Agenda and the Global Commission on International Migration compared.
[02:34:20.016 --> 02:34:21.657]  Now what we have in this title
[02:34:22.190 --> 02:34:27.731]  It's a very carefully crafted, obfuscatory, linguistic use of terms.
[02:34:27.811 --> 02:34:28.431]  They're good at that.
[02:34:28.731 --> 02:34:29.911]  Yes, they're very good at it.
[02:34:30.151 --> 02:34:45.714]  That make it difficult for people to track what's going on here, because we don't think of the illegal aliens as a part of a migration scheme, and we are completely ignorant and kept that way of what their impact is on the development side of things.
[02:34:46.154 --> 02:34:49.075]  And so by combining the terms migration and development,
[02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:57.866]  And running them into search boxes in everybody's websites, all about, you return just about no response.
[02:34:58.206 --> 02:35:05.751]  So, tell me again, if I want to find this, everybody listen, this is important, if I want to find this, what am I going to type into Google?
[02:35:06.031 --> 02:35:09.153]  Well, there's two ways to get it, but the easiest way to do it is just go to unp.un.org
[02:35:15.282 --> 02:35:15.702]  Okay.
[02:35:15.902 --> 02:35:23.104]  Those are acronyms for the United Nations Publications, that's their bookstore, unitednations.org.
[02:35:23.724 --> 02:35:24.084]  Alright.
[02:35:24.324 --> 02:35:29.966]  So when you go there, and you can also get it by typing in unpopulation.org.
[02:35:31.426 --> 02:35:34.667]  Unpopulation, isn't that cute?
[02:35:34.687 --> 02:35:34.987]  Yeah.
[02:35:35.007 --> 02:35:36.027]  A little play on words there.
[02:35:36.047 --> 02:35:37.447]  There goes 80% of us.
[02:35:37.487 --> 02:35:37.847]  Bye-bye.
[02:35:38.148 --> 02:35:39.468]  About 80%, okay?
[02:35:39.828 --> 02:35:41.408]  So now here's the sales number.
[02:35:41.888 --> 02:35:42.749]  Makes it real easy.
[02:35:43.349 --> 02:35:43.809]  It's E
[02:35:44.713 --> 02:36:04.524]  dot zero six dot the roman numeral eight which is x i i i dot seven so it's e dot zero six dot x i i i dot seven and when you get the book it's not very expensive but it's very good.
[02:36:04.544 --> 02:36:05.725]  Now what's it called again?
[02:36:05.805 --> 02:36:11.168]  What it is is the compendium of recommendations on international migration
[02:36:11.972 --> 02:36:12.592]  And development.
[02:36:12.632 --> 02:36:13.293]  It's a mouthful.
[02:36:13.533 --> 02:36:15.414]  But a compendium is... I'm lazy.
[02:36:15.454 --> 02:36:16.214]  Tell me what it says.
[02:36:16.555 --> 02:36:17.535]  Bottom line.
[02:36:17.715 --> 02:36:18.216]  I'm going to.
[02:36:18.236 --> 02:36:19.476]  This is radio.
[02:36:19.496 --> 02:36:20.277]  Gotta hit it hard.
[02:36:20.377 --> 02:36:20.857]  I'm going.
[02:36:21.658 --> 02:36:24.199]  A compendium basically is putting everything together.
[02:36:24.479 --> 02:36:24.679]  Alright.
[02:36:24.699 --> 02:36:38.327]  What the UN has done here is they've gone through and they've combed all of their documents and they've brought together in one source book all of the various recommendations that have come out of all the high-level dialogues in the world forums on international migration and development
[02:36:38.709 --> 02:36:47.613]  And this work was put together in preface for the High Level Forum on International Migration and Development, which was held a year before last, 2006.
[02:36:48.873 --> 02:36:51.815]  This July, they held another one over in Brussels.
[02:36:52.475 --> 02:37:01.239]  And out of these, what we're getting, if you study this document, you will see why there has been no move whatsoever to shut down
[02:37:01.895 --> 02:37:16.338]  Uh, the flow of illegal aliens or migrants, if you will, or refugees or asylum seekers or undocumented workers, because it is too valuable in regards to the gross domestic product of the various developing nations.
[02:37:16.738 --> 02:37:22.199]  This is an exceedingly valuable in tunes of hundreds of billions of dollars industry.
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:24.760]  And so basically human resources
[02:37:25.333 --> 02:37:27.975]  And human capital is at the bottom of this.
[02:37:28.195 --> 02:37:31.617]  That's why we're going into the Security Partnership Agreement.
[02:37:31.657 --> 02:37:33.539]  So that would be one reason for it.
[02:37:33.759 --> 02:37:37.942]  I guess, let me see if I can translate that into basic English.
[02:37:37.982 --> 02:37:53.572]  Are you saying that, and again, I claim this, I said this a million times, a lot of people say it, are you saying that the reason to say that the Mexican government doesn't want to stop the illegal immigration is because all those people are up here sending their money back to Mexico?
[02:37:53.852 --> 02:37:54.513]  Remittances.
[02:37:54.773 --> 02:37:55.753]  Remittances, right.
[02:37:56.033 --> 02:37:56.373]  Okay.
[02:37:56.573 --> 02:38:04.915]  It's a tremendous financial opportunity because that money then gets funneled into sustainable development programs in the countries of origin.
[02:38:05.455 --> 02:38:07.896]  And it bleeds the United States dry.
[02:38:08.196 --> 02:38:09.416]  Exactly, bingo.
[02:38:09.756 --> 02:38:19.738]  And at the same time, in this transfer of wealth scheme, it really destroys economies because when you have people here that are working, taking up all the jobs,
[02:38:20.231 --> 02:38:27.698]  And then not putting their money back into our economy, but taking it out and sending it to another economy and have no loyalty.
[02:38:27.818 --> 02:38:30.541]  And on top of that, sucking off our welfare state at the same time.
[02:38:30.561 --> 02:38:31.342]  Don't forget that part.
[02:38:31.642 --> 02:38:35.826]  And when you started out, we talked about the Madeline Cartel Jr.
[02:38:35.846 --> 02:38:38.288]  that is up for parole.
[02:38:38.609 --> 02:38:41.251]  But that goes right back to these recommendations.
[02:38:41.331 --> 02:38:43.193]  If you'll see, as you read there,
[02:38:43.857 --> 02:38:49.902]  But what they're doing is they're saying that anyone can shrug off their nationality and assume another one anytime they want.
[02:38:49.922 --> 02:38:52.343]  Yeah, that's in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
[02:38:52.644 --> 02:38:54.045]  Yes, it's also in the Compendium.
[02:38:54.785 --> 02:38:59.909]  You can go any place that you want and you can get consular assistance for legal.
[02:39:00.329 --> 02:39:01.490]  You can keep your language.
[02:39:01.510 --> 02:39:02.811]  You don't have to assimilate.
[02:39:03.191 --> 02:39:05.333]  You can repatriate anytime you want to.
[02:39:05.353 --> 02:39:05.933]  Tower of Babel.
[02:39:05.954 --> 02:39:08.055]  You don't have to follow immigration.
[02:39:08.095 --> 02:39:09.496]  You just migrate, you see.
[02:39:09.816 --> 02:39:12.158]  It's like going from one green pasture to another.
[02:39:12.178 --> 02:39:12.959]  Far out.
[02:39:13.513 --> 02:39:26.161]  It is the global paradigm for the 21st century, so it ties directly back again to Chapter 7 and other places, the agenda 21, promoting the sustainable human settlement development.
[02:39:26.461 --> 02:39:39.409]  And so, the whole thing is critical, and I think that if more of the listeners will get hold of this book and read it, then we'll also understand, what are we talking about with tying up the hate crimes legislation at the same time?
[02:39:39.649 --> 02:39:41.010]  Well, that's part of the same thing.
[02:39:41.290 --> 02:39:42.911]  It's a prohibition of xenophobia.
[02:39:43.294 --> 02:39:49.637]  You can't destroy a culture if you have the people that are being destroyed up in arms against the invaders.
[02:39:49.717 --> 02:39:54.640]  So we have barbarians in the gates, and we can't throw them off because of the hate crimes.
[02:39:55.260 --> 02:40:00.223]  We can't throw them out because they are an economic boon to their countries of origin.
[02:40:00.763 --> 02:40:10.748]  And our government, because it's bound by these arrangements through the State Department, our government is honoring these United Nations directives
[02:40:11.324 --> 02:40:14.690]  As opposed to our constitutional rights.
[02:40:14.870 --> 02:40:17.694]  And so Bush is backing the convicted rapist murderer.
[02:40:18.295 --> 02:40:26.128]  Well, Bush is not only backing that rapist, but he's also backing the idea of a North American community
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:31.760]  Absolutely.
[02:40:31.820 --> 02:40:33.841]  William, thank you very much for that call.
[02:40:33.921 --> 02:40:34.741]  I appreciate it.
[02:40:34.941 --> 02:40:37.402]  That was the best call I've had in a long time.
[02:40:37.842 --> 02:40:42.543]  Wasn't as exciting as the one before, but listen, that was very informative.
[02:40:42.563 --> 02:40:43.303]  I appreciate that.
[02:40:43.323 --> 02:40:44.543]  Y'all go to that, what he was talking about.
[02:40:44.583 --> 02:40:46.524]  Go check it out, because he is correct.
[02:40:46.864 --> 02:40:49.044]  The best way to hang the U.N.
[02:40:50.045 --> 02:40:51.925]  is to go to their own documents and look at them.
[02:40:52.751 --> 02:40:59.157]  You know, I know they sprinkle the sugar coat all over the excrement, but it's there, and it's easy to see.
[02:40:59.197 --> 02:41:03.401]  Just brush aside the sugar coat, and there you'll see it, right there, a big pile.
[02:41:04.382 --> 02:41:06.845]  Okay, now we have Tim in Texas.
[02:41:06.905 --> 02:41:08.627]  Tim, you're up next on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:09.027 --> 02:41:09.607]  Hello, Bob.
[02:41:09.648 --> 02:41:10.248]  How are you, sir?
[02:41:10.548 --> 02:41:11.970]  Well, I'm doing alright, I think.
[02:41:12.352 --> 02:41:17.513]  You're doing a heck of a job, I know that, and you've picked a subject today that is very near and dear to my heart.
[02:41:17.713 --> 02:41:21.434]  Well, Alex asked me to bash the U.N., and so I thought, well, gee, how could I not?
[02:41:21.754 --> 02:41:23.155]  Well, let me help you a little bit.
[02:41:23.235 --> 02:41:36.338]  Let's, uh, let's, this, the fellow before mentioned Agenda 21, and being a fellow Texan, you and I see lots of, uh, people coming across the border illegally.
[02:41:36.738 --> 02:41:39.519]  Some people want to call them, uh, migrant workers.
[02:41:39.959 --> 02:41:41.239]  They're illegal aliens.
[02:41:42.365 --> 02:41:57.655]  And in Chapter 26 of Agenda 21 that the United States signed on to in 1992 at the Rio de Janeiro Earth Meeting, Agenda 21, Chapter 26.1, I'm going to read one sentence out of this part.
[02:41:57.675 --> 02:41:57.895]  Alright.
[02:42:03.232 --> 02:42:10.717]  You know, you and I both know the Mexicans consider the entire Southwest their indigenous land, correct?
[02:42:10.977 --> 02:42:18.242]  Yeah, well, you know, I don't want to say THE Mexicans, but a lot of influential Mexicans do, yeah.
[02:42:18.482 --> 02:42:20.484]  Yeah, the globalist Mexicans.
[02:42:21.624 --> 02:42:28.409]  Here's the reason that the Austin Police Department in particular will not even touch the illegal aliens.
[02:42:29.413 --> 02:42:33.237]  This comes from, again, Chapter 26.1, Agenda 21.
[02:42:33.337 --> 02:42:42.627]  Indigenous people and their communities shall enjoy the full measure of human rights and fundamental freedoms without hindrance or discrimination.
[02:42:44.248 --> 02:42:45.910]  And here's the real kicker, Bob.
[02:42:46.791 --> 02:42:49.393]  If you look down to Chapter 26.3, Section B, it states,
[02:42:52.845 --> 02:42:54.046]  We're good to go.
[02:43:17.099 --> 02:43:28.387]  We have to let these people in here because it is, according to them, it is their indigenous land and we have to let them in here so they can vote to establish the laws.
[02:43:28.647 --> 02:43:37.312]  Yeah, well that actually does comport very well with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights because it says that you are quite free to just cross borders whenever the heck you want to and then come back.
[02:43:37.372 --> 02:43:38.773]  I mean, it's there.
[02:43:38.953 --> 02:43:39.574]  That's interesting.
[02:43:39.614 --> 02:43:41.095]  Again, this is a caller.
[02:43:41.155 --> 02:43:42.016]  Thank you for the call, Tim.
[02:43:42.036 --> 02:43:42.576]  I appreciate it.
[02:43:43.340 --> 02:43:48.104]  This is a caller who's done some research and looked into what they say, and again, that is critical.
[02:43:48.344 --> 02:44:01.275]  Now that was kind of, you know, some of that stuff you read was like, okay, that's a little long-winded, but if you sit there and take the time and read it, you know, read it into 21, you know, a lot of this stuff that doesn't make any sense all of a sudden becomes very, very clear.
[02:44:02.115 --> 02:44:04.497]  Okay, we have Seth in Nebraska.
[02:44:04.597 --> 02:44:05.778]  Seth, are you there?
[02:44:06.639 --> 02:44:07.700]  Yeah, how's it going, Bob?
[02:44:08.020 --> 02:44:08.741]  Oh, I don't know.
[02:44:08.941 --> 02:44:12.624]  I've got about another 15 minutes before I can go back and sell toilet parts.
[02:44:13.345 --> 02:44:17.288]  Well, I'd just like to say you're doing a great job, and you're the best fella for Alex when he's out.
[02:44:17.868 --> 02:44:18.269]  No, thank you.
[02:44:18.289 --> 02:44:19.910]  I appreciate that.
[02:44:19.930 --> 02:44:20.510]  Are you there?
[02:44:20.951 --> 02:44:28.416]  Yeah, I want to speak to all the rampant global warming propaganda, especially with Al Gore getting the peace prize and sharing it with the IPCC.
[02:44:30.778 --> 02:44:38.983]  I've never seen so much anti-human, pro-Earth propaganda just rampant everywhere.
[02:44:39.004 --> 02:44:42.346]  I mean, I see it makes the claim that carbon is a
[02:44:42.910 --> 02:44:47.355]  Is a pollutant like if you go to Whole Foods now, they have it on the bag.
[02:44:47.375 --> 02:45:06.094]  It's like their green program and the new commercial for the new hybrid Honda Civic, the background when it says like Civic, it's green and even inserts and DVDs I just bought have, there's the production companies are starting up their own green programs and
[02:45:06.832 --> 02:45:07.993]  It's just, I've never seen it.
[02:45:08.173 --> 02:45:10.574]  You know what, I want to make a comment on that.
[02:45:10.614 --> 02:45:11.594]  That reminded me of something.
[02:45:11.614 --> 02:45:20.438]  You know, this Kyoto Accord and all this garbage that they want us to sign off on, and they're actually trying to glom that onto that loss treaty we're trying to stop.
[02:45:21.298 --> 02:45:23.379]  You know, somebody tell me something.
[02:45:23.699 --> 02:45:26.200]  Somebody out there who's smarter than me, tell me this.
[02:45:27.259 --> 02:45:39.825]  The Kyoto Accord requires the United States of America to cut back on our emissions and all that by 30% or something like that, which would basically crunch our economy down to nothing.
[02:45:42.231 --> 02:45:48.093]  But it also exempts the developing countries, like Communist China, from having to do the same thing.
[02:45:48.553 --> 02:45:50.554]  So somebody do some math with me.
[02:45:51.034 --> 02:46:06.438]  Tell me how taking a factory in the United States, which is subject to EPA and environmental regulations and air regulations and all that stuff, taking that factory and moving it over to Communist China, where they don't give a rat's behind about pollution, how does that save the earth?
[02:46:07.719 --> 02:46:08.139]  It doesn't.
[02:46:08.679 --> 02:46:10.560]  It's another form of command and control.
[02:46:10.620 --> 02:46:11.640]  How is that green?
[02:46:12.380 --> 02:46:12.881]  It's not.
[02:46:13.321 --> 02:46:22.583]  It's going over and selling it to the highest bidder and using the cheapest flavor possible to make the slave-made goods and bring down the economies of the rest of the world.
[02:46:22.703 --> 02:46:25.464]  I tell you, I did something not too long ago to help Al Gore out.
[02:46:26.044 --> 02:46:26.725]  It was great!
[02:46:28.445 --> 02:46:35.247]  I drive a V8 pickup truck and it gets like 11 or 12 miles to the gallon.
[02:46:36.454 --> 02:46:44.438]  And so I went out and got a 300 horsepower Ford Mustang a few months ago.
[02:46:44.998 --> 02:46:45.958]  Big old V8 in there.
[02:46:46.439 --> 02:46:51.241]  And it gets like 17.4 to 22 miles to the gallon.
[02:46:51.761 --> 02:47:01.626]  So what I've done by driving my Mustang, my V8 Mustang, more often than my truck, I'm helping to save the environment and I'm getting carbon credits!
[02:47:02.886 --> 02:47:04.167]  How about that, Al?
[02:47:05.569 --> 02:47:07.890]  It's going to help save the glaciers from melting.
[02:47:07.910 --> 02:47:11.591]  Yeah, I am saving Mars' polar ice caps from melting.
[02:47:12.011 --> 02:47:12.492]  Myself.
[02:47:13.052 --> 02:47:18.314]  Not to mention Europa and the other moons of Jupiter and Saturn are now liquid oceans of methane and nitrogen.
[02:47:18.554 --> 02:47:20.614]  That's because of my Dodge Ram.
[02:47:21.315 --> 02:47:25.856]  Yeah, because like you said earlier, I loved it, the fumes from Earth are wafting through space.
[02:47:25.876 --> 02:47:30.318]  Yeah, my fumes from my Dodge Ram pickup truck have wafted
[02:47:31.056 --> 02:47:35.417]  Out into space and have melted the polar ice caps of the other planets and the moons.
[02:47:35.957 --> 02:47:45.939]  But now that I'm driving a car, which is a lot more fun, I am helping to conserve the polar ice caps of Mars and the moons of Jupiter.
[02:47:46.439 --> 02:47:47.840]  Hey, far out, man!
[02:47:49.140 --> 02:47:49.760]  What else you got?
[02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:57.002]  Also, real quick, I just want to say I heard the caller from Pennsylvania last Friday talk about I-80.
[02:47:57.682 --> 02:47:58.322]  And it's true.
[02:47:59.375 --> 02:48:00.376]  I don't know.
[02:48:17.636 --> 02:48:20.238]  Interoperability is the word for all that stuff.
[02:48:20.338 --> 02:48:24.721]  All that stuff has to be interoperable nationwide so they can screw you wherever you go.
[02:48:24.741 --> 02:48:26.382]  Seth, thank you for the call.
[02:48:26.422 --> 02:48:27.563]  We're up against a break.
[02:48:28.444 --> 02:48:34.608]  After the break we're going to go with John in Missouri and Mark in Atlanta and I think after that we'll just about be out of here.
[02:48:34.628 --> 02:48:40.432]  So, once again, this is Bob Daisy for Alex Jones on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:48:46.027 --> 02:48:47.428]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:47.448 --> 02:48:49.570]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.271 --> 02:48:53.113]  In the near future, Earth is dominated.
[02:48:53.574 --> 02:48:56.936]  It's known as the Builder Earth.
[02:48:57.117 --> 02:49:00.259]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:49:00.780 --> 02:49:03.182]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:03.946 --> 02:49:11.328]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.309 --> 02:49:19.251]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:19.751 --> 02:49:23.234]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:23.614 --> 02:49:26.136]  Bill of Rights makes great progress for the world government.
[02:49:26.176 --> 02:49:27.337]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.357 --> 02:49:28.118]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.138 --> 02:49:29.199]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.399 --> 02:49:30.180]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:31.280]  That's what they're after, you see.

[02:49:43.090 --> 02:49:44.211]  You have been warned.
[02:49:46.627 --> 02:49:47.687]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:49:47.988 --> 02:49:50.789]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:51.049 --> 02:49:55.210]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:55.631 --> 02:49:56.451]  So what do you do?
[02:49:56.771 --> 02:50:01.353]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:50:01.833 --> 02:50:03.974]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:50:04.454 --> 02:50:05.334]  Sheltering in Place.
[02:50:05.734 --> 02:50:09.455]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[02:50:09.775 --> 02:50:19.137]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:50:44.713 --> 02:50:49.276]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:50:49.676 --> 02:50:52.618]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:50:52.939 --> 02:50:55.500]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:50:55.861 --> 02:51:00.684]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:51:01.064 --> 02:51:06.448]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:51:06.748 --> 02:51:09.710]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:51:09.890 --> 02:51:10.450]  We're good to go.
[02:51:33.286 --> 02:51:38.497]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.

[02:51:59.096 --> 02:52:03.879]  Okay, Bob Basie, back on the Alex Jones Show this 15th day of October 2007.
[02:52:04.539 --> 02:52:09.762]  And I think I have John from Missouri up next.
[02:52:09.862 --> 02:52:11.623]  John, how you doing?
[02:52:12.163 --> 02:52:12.783]  Hey, fine.
[02:52:12.843 --> 02:52:13.444]  How are you today?
[02:52:13.824 --> 02:52:14.444]  I'm doing alright.
[02:52:15.004 --> 02:52:17.826]  Hey, where was the U.N.
[02:52:18.166 --> 02:52:23.509]  when they were marching the Native Americans across America, taking them from their lands?
[02:52:24.349 --> 02:52:27.471]  Well, they weren't around back then, so I can't blame them for that.
[02:52:28.329 --> 02:52:28.730]  I know.
[02:52:29.170 --> 02:52:38.237]  Hey, listen, I've been wanting to get in and suggest something to Alex, since he is a friend of Ron Paul's, right?
[02:52:38.677 --> 02:52:38.958]  Yeah.
[02:52:39.918 --> 02:52:40.339]  Okay.
[02:52:42.420 --> 02:52:46.804]  George Washington wasn't president when they started the revolution, was he?
[02:52:47.985 --> 02:52:49.906]  No, because we didn't have a country yet.
[02:52:50.487 --> 02:52:50.967]  Okay.
[02:52:51.588 --> 02:52:54.430]  Well, as far as I'm concerned, we don't have a country now.
[02:52:55.317 --> 02:52:59.039]  And I think one of the best ways to get rid of the U.N.
[02:52:59.719 --> 02:53:17.168]  is everybody organized behind Ron Paul, military people, elected people, veterans, everybody, go take over Washington and then if we want we can elect Ron Paul President.
[02:53:17.208 --> 02:53:18.529]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:53:18.569 --> 02:53:21.350]  You know, if Ron Paul were the President of the United States,
[02:53:22.514 --> 02:53:23.155]  And the U.N.
[02:53:23.195 --> 02:53:30.779]  appropriation bill to fund that hive of totalitarian vermin came on his desk, he'd veto it.
[02:53:31.360 --> 02:53:32.300]  And that would kill him.
[02:53:32.961 --> 02:53:33.481]  That's right.
[02:53:33.661 --> 02:53:39.504]  That would be random, because those leeches suck off the American taxpayers.
[02:53:39.564 --> 02:53:43.347]  It's way more than 22% of what we pay for that organization.
[02:53:43.967 --> 02:53:47.209]  But those leeches suck off the American taxpayers like nobody's business.
[02:53:47.529 --> 02:53:50.551]  If we cut off their supply of money, that
[02:53:51.189 --> 02:53:56.832]  That weed would just wither and die.
[02:53:56.852 --> 02:54:11.979]  Ron Paul, as the president, could veto such a thing, but the House of Representatives, if they were doing their job, could just refuse to fund it, because the House of Representatives is where all funding must come from.
[02:54:13.231 --> 02:54:30.042]  That's right, and you know, I really feel, I wouldn't suggest this if I didn't believe it, but I think if they organized right, we could take Washington over without a shot, take our country back, and get things reorganized.
[02:54:30.142 --> 02:54:31.623]  Well, I think that's a good suggestion.
[02:54:31.663 --> 02:54:32.404]  Vote for Ron Paul.
[02:54:32.684 --> 02:54:34.185]  John from Missouri, thank you for the phone call.
[02:54:34.205 --> 02:54:35.345]  I've got time for one more.
[02:54:35.405 --> 02:54:36.886]  I've got Mark in Atlanta.
[02:54:37.147 --> 02:54:37.767]  Mark, are you there?
[02:54:39.194 --> 02:54:40.475]  You guys are ever in my prayers, Mike.
[02:54:40.515 --> 02:54:56.507]  My site is doyoulovejesus.org, letter U. The thing that has concerned me, I'm catching wind that basically they're going to make it to where even if you reload, the powder, the primers, like that, are going to be made more and more scarce.
[02:54:56.827 --> 02:54:58.269]  So yeah, you have guns.
[02:54:59.652 --> 02:55:04.214]  Yeah, it's a really effective billy club, but other than that... Well, that's one of the U.N.'
[02:55:04.194 --> 02:55:04.675]  's deals.
[02:55:04.735 --> 02:55:22.783]  They want to restrict ammunition sales, certain types of ammunition, specifically the .223 and the 7.62x39, and stuff that can be used in the guns that the Founding Fathers actually wanted us to have, if you actually study the history of it.
[02:55:22.803 --> 02:55:27.766]  Well, I've been wondering, as one with a mechanical engineering background, I'd like to see, do you love Jesus.org?
[02:55:29.756 --> 02:55:31.657]  I have a background in mechanical engineering.
[02:55:31.697 --> 02:55:40.019]  I'd like to see if anybody out there would like to see about exploring what would be necessary in the way of tooling to be able to manufacture cartridges like that.
[02:55:40.039 --> 02:55:41.619]  Well, that's a good question, but guess what?
[02:55:41.659 --> 02:55:44.180]  Mark, I wish we weren't out of time, but we are.
[02:55:45.020 --> 02:55:47.501]  And once again, this is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones.
[02:55:47.561 --> 02:55:57.183]  I'll be back tomorrow, and John McManus, the president of John Birch Society, will be on in the second hour, and I may have another guest or two, and we'll continue
[02:55:57.992 --> 02:56:02.876]  With my substitution for the inimitable Alex Jones.
[02:56:03.676 --> 02:56:07.599]  And I want to thank him for letting me do this because this is more fun than a barrel of monkeys.
[02:56:07.639 --> 02:56:08.540]  This is what I live for.
[02:56:09.401 --> 02:56:11.963]  So the UN Bash-a-thon is over for today.
[02:56:13.004 --> 02:56:19.809]  We will see you tomorrow at 11 and you can restream this thing seven more times on InfoWars.com.
[02:56:25.791 --> 02:56:30.806]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
