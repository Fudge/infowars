[00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:06.580]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.301]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:10.142]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.783 --> 00:00:11.583]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:13.265]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.925 --> 00:00:17.608]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.108 --> 00:00:22.191]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:39.045]  Another extremely important broadcast lined up for you today as we chronicle the rise of the first planetary world government controlled by absolutely ruthless, sadistic control freaks.
[00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.107]  The battle is joined.
[00:00:41.127 --> 00:00:44.010]  Folks, I have video footage.
[00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.154]  It's coming in from YouTube, LiveLeak, all these different sites, Google Video.
[00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:53.398]  Four or five videos a day to the point of we can't even keep track of them.
[00:00:54.031 --> 00:01:13.160]  There's a city council member, the mayor kicks him out, he politely walks out of the meeting, the police chief punches him in the back, knocks him over, and then on video, literally beats the living daylights out of him, and the news puts it on television and says, Oh, the council member's in trouble for fighting with police!
[00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:21.284]  But again, the media thinks you're so dumb, they run TV spots nationwide on news, saying Mercury's now good for children's brains,
[00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.563]  They are now running a program saying lead paint is good for children.
[00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:31.565]  They're now saying poison in food is good for you.
[00:01:31.865 --> 00:01:34.227]  I mean you cannot make this stuff up!
[00:01:35.608 --> 00:01:36.729]  And this is what happens now.
[00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:42.954]  I mean pretty soon they'll like chop your head off and literally drink your blood and then they'll say you're assaulting the officer.
[00:01:45.077 --> 00:01:58.866]  I mean, right in front of everybody, he just punches him right in the back, knocks him over, gets on top of the city councilman up in Indiana, in a pretty good-sized town, starts punching him like WWF wrestling as hard as he can in the side of the head.
[00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:00.567]  The guy's knocked out unconscious.
[00:02:02.828 --> 00:02:14.115]  And then they go ahead and arrest him and say, hey, I'm going to beat you up in front of video cameras in the city council, and then we're going to take you to jail after you go to the hospital.
[00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:18.086]  And this is how it's going to work in America.
[00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:23.533]  Mayors, governors, the leaders are just going to point and say, take them, but you're not going to just get beat up.
[00:02:23.553 --> 00:02:25.375]  You're going to be flown out to a foreign camp.
[00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.681]  They got the cops trained.
[00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:31.103]  They are ready to do it.
[00:02:31.696 --> 00:02:36.280]  Now, by the way, this city council member was exposing corruption by the police, trying to disbar the police.
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.987]  We've had sheriffs, police chiefs killed, I see it every month around the country, when other cops try to stop them, or councils try to stop them, they kill mayors, they kill chiefs.
[00:02:45.468 --> 00:02:46.629]  I mean, this is the Mafia!
[00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:55.916]  You want to be ruled by Mafia, you want to be ruled by bad cops, pretty soon they'll have the cops literally on gold thrones in the councils, and it'll all just be local kingdoms.
[00:02:56.457 --> 00:02:57.858]  That's how it used to work, the guy that
[00:02:58.732 --> 00:03:00.913]  Had the most force took over and you had to worship him.
[00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:02.714]  He wore a big crown and everybody bowed down to him.
[00:03:04.374 --> 00:03:11.057]  So I've got all that news and again a wheelchair-bound woman dies after being shot with taser ten times.
[00:03:11.978 --> 00:03:13.578]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.821]  A Clay County woman, this just came out an hour ago, is dead.
[00:03:20.841 --> 00:03:21.782]  Shocked ten times.
[00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:25.697]  And it's just like my friend here in Austin, the Home Depot manager.
[00:03:26.297 --> 00:03:29.819]  He's paralyzed, chest down, and he couldn't get out of the car, so they beat him up.
[00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.520]  They say, look, get up and walk!
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.660]  Listen, I'm paralyzed!
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.141]  And they just go, hey, die!
[00:03:34.161 --> 00:03:36.462]  You know, it's time to die!
[00:03:39.304 --> 00:03:41.145]  And, uh, that's how it works now.
[00:03:44.326 --> 00:03:45.627]  So, they, uh, killed him.
[00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.710]  And, uh, Fox News is endorsing the shocking
[00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:58.427]  Of the Florida College student, Mr. Myers, who, by the way, is afraid to talk to anybody.
[00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:01.348]  His lawyers have told him to shut up and go quietly into the night.
[00:04:01.868 --> 00:04:03.349]  He'd actually have lawsuits against them.
[00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.470]  By the time they're done with him, he'll have hardcore probation if he's lucky.
[00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.612]  Remember our listener who had the video camera in the car, and the cops arrested him for wiretapping, and they were going to send him to jail for felonies?
[00:04:13.972 --> 00:04:19.954]  And then I told him to stand up and resist, and they did it, and he won, and they dropped it, and now he's suing them?
[00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.441]  Or our listeners who thought they were going to prison, the lawyer was telling them for having the upside-down American flag in their yard.
[00:04:26.461 --> 00:04:32.184]  And we told them to stand up, fire the lawyer, they did, and the city dropped it and apologized.
[00:04:33.784 --> 00:04:35.465]  But see, most people don't listen.
[00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:40.947]  It turns out that Mr. Myers is a listener of the show, a 9-11 truther, as we could guess.
[00:04:42.388 --> 00:04:44.649]  But he's not listening, his parents have him.
[00:04:45.442 --> 00:04:50.208]  They're establishment types and they're going to work within the system.
[00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:51.810]  Okay.
[00:04:52.611 --> 00:04:53.392]  Go right ahead.
[00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:56.936]  We got his friend Josh Goldman joining us in 25 minutes.
[00:04:56.956 --> 00:04:57.377]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.795 --> 00:05:02.555]  Terrorism!
[00:05:02.715 --> 00:05:03.455]  Terrorism!
[00:05:03.555 --> 00:05:09.637]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:05:09.877 --> 00:05:11.477]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:05:11.717 --> 00:05:14.198]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:05:14.578 --> 00:05:29.161]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:05:29.181 --> 00:05:29.501]  government.
[00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:31.481]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:37.766]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:05:37.906 --> 00:05:42.410]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:06:04.298 --> 00:06:07.482]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:09.724]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.105 --> 00:06:17.753]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.453 --> 00:06:25.517]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.897 --> 00:06:37.323]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.643 --> 00:06:41.165]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.606 --> 00:06:43.547]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.867 --> 00:06:47.709]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:06.282]  The Digestive Tract, a natural waste factory built within all of our bodies.
[00:07:06.682 --> 00:07:11.685]  Roughly 25 feet of tunnels designed to absorb nutrition and then dispel the waste.
[00:07:12.086 --> 00:07:13.967]  But what happens when the waste gets clogged up?
[00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:21.694]  More than 4 million Americans have frequent constipation, accounting for 2.5 million physician visits a year.
[00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:27.117]  Now there's AlloCleanse, an all-natural formula based on herbs and safe enzymes.
[00:07:27.417 --> 00:07:32.799]  AlloCleanse gently sweeps the entire digestive tract and supports comfortable regular bathroom habits.
[00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:39.282]  You'll feel lighter, and you'll feel clean inside, and when you remove the waste buildup with AlloCleanse, you'll have more energy.
[00:07:39.562 --> 00:07:43.164]  Energy to use on other things, besides worrying about constipation.
[00:07:43.664 --> 00:07:48.508]  For a risk-free trial of Allocleanse, call 1-800-890-3525.
[00:07:48.728 --> 00:07:52.130]  Call in now to find out how you can get two free gifts with your order.
[00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.572]  Try Allocleanse risk-free by calling 1-800-890-3525.
[00:07:54.592 --> 00:07:54.812]  That's 1-800-890-3525.
[00:08:06.192 --> 00:08:10.375]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:11.035 --> 00:08:11.856]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.596 --> 00:08:13.457]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.177 --> 00:08:17.820]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.482]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:27.105]  All right.
[00:08:27.646 --> 00:08:31.248]  Huge developments, as you know, on the economic front.
[00:08:31.268 --> 00:08:35.571]  I'm going to walk through that in the second and third hour today.
[00:08:37.075 --> 00:08:38.377]  Massive developments.
[00:08:38.397 --> 00:08:43.042]  Let me just give you a prelude to what I have here in front of me.
[00:08:43.062 --> 00:08:47.707]  Fed rate cut could recede quickly.
[00:08:49.249 --> 00:08:58.739]  Now by that, Fed rate cut could recede quickly, the exuberance, the boosting of the stock market will recede quickly.
[00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:08.163]  This is like a dying man who is going to die being given a shot of adrenaline where it just makes him feel like he's alive again for a few minutes.
[00:09:11.064 --> 00:09:13.925]  By doing this, it caused the dollar to go down even more.
[00:09:14.025 --> 00:09:19.007]  It caused crude oil to go to an all-time high of $82 plus a barrel.
[00:09:19.427 --> 00:09:25.170]  They're now saying it's going to go well above $100 in the next six months, maybe even sooner.
[00:09:26.176 --> 00:09:38.947]  We sounded pretty wild a year ago when we came back from Ottawa and said the Bilderberg Group says in the next year and a half they're going to have $150 a barrel oil.
[00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:43.271]  But as usual, what they call for happens.
[00:09:44.472 --> 00:09:45.252]  They run things.
[00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:54.240]  And so get ready, ladies and gentlemen, because you see when they devalue the currency further, as this rate cut does,
[00:09:58.368 --> 00:10:02.229]  You're going to pay more for things because your dollar is worth less.
[00:10:02.249 --> 00:10:03.510]  See, it's a scam.
[00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:11.792]  But Americans see the stock market as the indicator of the whole world, of the entire financial system.
[00:10:11.852 --> 00:10:17.834]  And so, go ahead and cut my dollar in half in value just so long as my stock market stays above $13,000.
[00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:23.561]  They literally want the illusion.
[00:10:23.601 --> 00:10:26.263]  They literally want the fraud.
[00:10:26.864 --> 00:10:35.751]  Ensuring that when it fully implodes, a month from now, six months from now, a year from now, that it will be many times worse.
[00:10:37.593 --> 00:10:39.615]  But again, the Fed gets to pose as the savior.
[00:10:41.084 --> 00:10:48.947]  By cutting rates, and then telling us how we've all overspent, and how we're all in too much debt, and how bad these subprimes are, and telling us things are going to get bad.
[00:10:49.047 --> 00:11:08.873]  Notice, Greenspan, Bernanke, Volcker, current and former Fed Chiefs, the head of the IMF, the head of the World Bank, their Chief Economist, they all come out and tell you, Treasury Secretary, that it's bad, that it's going to plunge, that the housing market is going to go down, that the dollar may end up not being the world reserve currency.
[00:11:10.197 --> 00:11:21.808]  All of these are market-killing moves, and then as a salve, after warning you it's coming, they say, okay, but we'll save you and give you one more shot of narcotics to ease your pain.
[00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:25.691]  It's kind of like how they sedate someone before they give them lethal injection.
[00:11:28.294 --> 00:11:36.341]  And the reason you can tell that they're really going to give us a massive recession, bare minimum, could be catastrophic world depression, is because they've engineered it in the past
[00:11:37.188 --> 00:11:39.049]  They openly write about how they consolidate.
[00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:40.129]  In fact, it's not just me today.
[00:11:41.129 --> 00:11:54.193]  I did a Google search this morning, seeing if anyone was pointing out that big banks, the actual A-tier banks, the central banks, the issuers of the currency and the credit, get money and power out of all this.
[00:11:54.373 --> 00:11:55.374]  Where is it in my stack?
[00:11:56.014 --> 00:11:58.434]  Fed rate cut rally could proceed quickly.
[00:11:58.875 --> 00:12:02.156]  Pickens, crude oil could hit $100 a barrel by the end of the year.
[00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:06.657]  China's ultimatum, let us invade Taiwan or we'll dump the dollar.
[00:12:08.496 --> 00:12:14.759]  Oh, here it is, Financial Times of London, the voice globally on the markets and the economy.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.500]  And most people don't even know that.
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.861]  It is not the Wall Street Journal.
[00:12:18.121 --> 00:12:19.722]  It has never been the Wall Street Journal.
[00:12:20.022 --> 00:12:24.184]  You want to read where they actually tell the truth, but in a sick way.
[00:12:24.845 --> 00:12:26.586]  They always say it's good, though.
[00:12:26.906 --> 00:12:28.827]  They admit what they're doing, but then spin it.
[00:12:29.547 --> 00:12:34.670]  They said two years ago they were going to kill the dollar, and they talked about were they going to do it gradually or plunge it.
[00:12:35.874 --> 00:12:39.616]  And that the globalists want a gradual death of America's financial system.
[00:12:41.356 --> 00:12:45.938]  Credit turmoil set to benefit big banks.
[00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.759]  Oh, financial times!
[00:12:48.119 --> 00:12:50.681]  They're benefiting from this.
[00:12:53.362 --> 00:13:04.987]  I went to a... my son is in private school here locally and I went to a function last night and there was a finance guy there and he was going, oh yeah, everybody knows they're orchestrating all this.
[00:13:05.706 --> 00:13:07.928]  I mean, for people that are in that business, they all know.
[00:13:09.689 --> 00:13:14.933]  But the general public, again, doesn't even know really what finance is.
[00:13:14.953 --> 00:13:16.354]  They don't know what mercantilism is.
[00:13:16.655 --> 00:13:18.496]  They don't know the three different types of capitalism.
[00:13:18.536 --> 00:13:21.258]  They don't know what neo-mercantilism is.
[00:13:21.278 --> 00:13:22.879]  Folks, they don't even know where the U.S.
[00:13:22.939 --> 00:13:23.560]  is on a map.
[00:13:24.861 --> 00:13:25.321]  Literally.
[00:13:25.381 --> 00:13:26.822]  I mean, they're like children.
[00:13:27.363 --> 00:13:29.765]  And so, you try to talk to them, they just can't understand.
[00:13:29.785 --> 00:13:33.768]  Oh, they'll understand later, though, when all this comes home to roost, as it's starting to do.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:40.945]  But again, the experts will be on TV, and they'll trust the very experts that orchestrated all this with their new spin.
[00:13:41.045 --> 00:13:54.934]  And you'll have to hear the mindless yuppies parroting the establishment line at the grocery store and church and at the gym and at the tea party, the cocktail party.
[00:13:54.954 --> 00:13:55.975]  You'll have to hear it.
[00:13:55.995 --> 00:13:59.597]  And you just have to sit there, and you don't even argue with them, because you know it's not worth it.
[00:14:00.038 --> 00:14:01.379]  I mean, you know they're not going to listen.
[00:14:01.419 --> 00:14:02.580]  They believe whatever.
[00:14:07.785 --> 00:14:09.186]  They believe Mercury is good for their children.
[00:14:12.428 --> 00:14:12.948]  They believe it.
[00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.012]  John Kerry's wife, though, is a pretty famous actress.
[00:14:20.072 --> 00:14:20.992]  She doesn't believe it anymore.
[00:14:21.012 --> 00:14:21.913]  She's got a book out about it.
[00:14:24.834 --> 00:14:25.455]  What's her name?
[00:14:25.515 --> 00:14:28.916]  She's the good-looking blonde at the TV shows.
[00:14:32.353 --> 00:14:33.373]  I'm going to get it and cover it.
[00:14:33.413 --> 00:14:36.934]  She's got a book about brainwashing and brain-damaging children by design.
[00:14:37.234 --> 00:14:39.755]  Look, Globalist, you're not going to stop the truth from coming out.
[00:14:40.155 --> 00:14:41.575]  I just hope that you understand that.
[00:14:41.595 --> 00:14:50.098]  A lot of cops are laughing right now, but they're going to give their son or daughter that third round, and the child's brain's going to go bye-bye, and then they're going to go, ooh, Alex Jones!
[00:14:50.198 --> 00:14:51.398]  They're not going to listen now!
[00:14:52.754 --> 00:14:53.274]  Oh no!
[00:14:53.375 --> 00:14:54.515]  It's too good!
[00:14:54.955 --> 00:14:55.736]  It's too good!
[00:14:55.756 --> 00:14:59.658]  In fact, get me the clips where Mercury's nutritious and lead paint is good for children.
[00:14:59.678 --> 00:15:00.019]  Please!
[00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:00.759]  Just get it!
[00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:02.180]  This is what you believe!
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.581]  This is what you follow!
[00:15:04.541 --> 00:15:08.944]  All I am is a normal person who happens to know what's going on and I'm freaked out!
[00:15:15.128 --> 00:15:19.150]  By the way, it's finally in the news.
[00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.052]  Population control is the next big thing in green culture.
[00:15:22.674 --> 00:15:41.002]  And this article goes through all these mainstream news stories that just came out in the last week, where they talk about, well here's one, global swarming.
[00:15:41.062 --> 00:15:44.063]  It's time for America to start cutting our baby emissions.
[00:15:46.522 --> 00:15:49.283]  There's also Alan Wiseman's book, The World Without Us.
[00:15:49.343 --> 00:15:51.064]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:15:51.184 --> 00:15:55.325]  Now is the perfect time for Endgame to come out, because I've been talking about this forever.
[00:15:55.645 --> 00:16:00.227]  And now it's right when the environmentalists are going, we've got to get rid of the people.
[00:16:00.607 --> 00:16:06.069]  And it says here, big mainstream news article, we've got to reduce our numbers to 500 million.
[00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:09.810]  Just as Endgame shows in all their documents.
[00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.632]  State Department Memorandum Action Plan 200.
[00:16:16.881 --> 00:16:20.424]  Alright, here is for all the establishment people who believe anything the system tells them.
[00:16:21.345 --> 00:16:23.326]  I guess believe it then, this aired nationwide.
[00:16:23.366 --> 00:16:25.888]  Now this is local, but it was packaged nationally.
[00:16:25.929 --> 00:16:32.314]  That is the newsprint, the video feeds, and then they have locals read, newsread over the video to give it a local look.
[00:16:32.454 --> 00:16:38.679]  This is federal propaganda that aired four years ago on every CBS channel in the country.
[00:16:39.439 --> 00:16:39.780]  Here it is.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.061]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[00:16:43.301 --> 00:16:46.662]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[00:16:47.262 --> 00:16:49.323]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[00:16:49.403 --> 00:16:52.064]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[00:16:52.084 --> 00:16:55.565]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter, Sina Mathers.
[00:16:58.141 --> 00:17:04.129]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:11.038]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[00:17:11.498 --> 00:17:17.166]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior.
[00:17:17.586 --> 00:17:20.068]  By the way, those were federally funded studies.
[00:17:20.108 --> 00:17:29.594]  Now we've got lots of stuff like this, but here's two weeks ago where they say, hey, we better have lead on our toys and we better have poison in our food or the economy won't do well.
[00:17:29.774 --> 00:17:30.154]  Here it is.
[00:17:30.194 --> 00:17:31.215]  This is MSNBC.
[00:17:34.557 --> 00:17:37.799]  A lot of people like to say, uh, scaremonger about China, right?
[00:17:37.819 --> 00:17:40.420]  A lot of politicians, and I know you talk about that issue all the time.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.741]  I think people should be careful what they wish for on China.
[00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:51.605]  You know, if China were to revalue its currency, or China is to start making, say, toys that don't have lead in them, or food that isn't poisonous, their costs of production are going to go up.
[00:17:51.645 --> 00:17:55.166]  And that means prices at Walmart here in the United States are going to go up, too.
[00:17:55.267 --> 00:17:57.788]  So, I would say China is our greatest friend right now.
[00:17:57.808 --> 00:18:00.389]  They're keeping prices low, and they're keeping prices from going up.
[00:18:00.489 --> 00:18:02.210]  And I see similar things all the time.
[00:18:06.078 --> 00:18:11.061]  Remember the 71-year-old woman, the neighborhood cop?
[00:18:11.121 --> 00:18:16.224]  They have these special cops in her town that just come up and spy on you?
[00:18:17.104 --> 00:18:21.446]  And he comes up and he says, I'm going to give you a fine for your Raspian Brown.
[00:18:21.527 --> 00:18:22.847]  And she goes, oh, whatever.
[00:18:22.867 --> 00:18:24.228]  Didn't yell at him, didn't cuss at him.
[00:18:24.248 --> 00:18:25.008]  Walks back in the house.
[00:18:25.048 --> 00:18:25.649]  Neighbors saw it.
[00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:28.510]  He grabs her and slams her head into the concrete.
[00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:29.951]  Blood spills out everywhere.
[00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:31.472]  They take her to jail.
[00:18:31.512 --> 00:18:33.293]  And by the way, they're pressing charges on her.
[00:18:34.241 --> 00:18:39.382]  And the state police did an investigation and found the officer did a great job.
[00:18:40.763 --> 00:18:43.203]  But everyone sees what you're doing.
[00:18:43.783 --> 00:18:45.824]  You can sit there and say Mercury's good.
[00:18:46.104 --> 00:18:48.024]  You can say lead and poison's good.
[00:18:48.364 --> 00:18:49.785]  You can tell us the war's good.
[00:18:49.825 --> 00:18:50.925]  You can tell us you're good.
[00:18:51.005 --> 00:18:52.345]  We know you're not.
[00:18:55.486 --> 00:18:57.487]  You can tell us the value in the dollar's good.
[00:18:57.547 --> 00:18:58.887]  We know it isn't good.
[00:19:00.433 --> 00:19:01.494]  I've got a big stack of those.
[00:19:01.534 --> 00:19:02.354]  I mean, look at this.
[00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:03.335]  Every day we get these.
[00:19:03.635 --> 00:19:07.157]  Wheelchair-bound woman dies for being shocked with taser ten times.
[00:19:07.177 --> 00:19:07.918]  That's coming up later.
[00:19:08.819 --> 00:19:09.599]  Fox Anchor.
[00:19:09.699 --> 00:19:11.800]  Officers should be commended for tasering student.
[00:19:13.722 --> 00:19:15.223]  Here's the Salt Lake City Tribune.
[00:19:15.303 --> 00:19:18.985]  Great Grandma Betty pleads innocent resisting arrest over dead grass.
[00:19:19.946 --> 00:19:23.628]  And they admit that she got her head slammed in the ground.
[00:19:23.648 --> 00:19:24.749]  They admit she got beat up.
[00:19:26.579 --> 00:19:42.634]  And it says that the State Police, State Department of Public Safety cleared Fliger of any wrongdoing and city officials pressed charges against Perry, the old woman, on the landscape violation of Class A misdemeanor and interfering with a police officer, Class B misdemeanor, interfering around a while back in her house.
[00:19:43.254 --> 00:19:46.237]  By the way, it's one of these little community watch-the-slave officers.
[00:19:50.396 --> 00:19:51.457]  What do they call it in here?
[00:19:51.897 --> 00:19:53.238]  I've got to find the actual name of it.
[00:19:53.879 --> 00:19:55.179]  It's going to get a lot worse, folks.
[00:19:55.219 --> 00:19:58.622]  Wait until they're shooting us in the streets with automatic weapons.
[00:20:03.385 --> 00:20:14.653]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:20:14.873 --> 00:20:18.356]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria
[00:20:18.616 --> 00:20:22.838]  Cysts, parasites and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:20:23.118 --> 00:20:33.802]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:20:34.022 --> 00:20:39.524]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:20:39.764 --> 00:20:46.086]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or

[00:20:51.213 --> 00:20:52.355]  Now yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.701 --> 00:21:05.602]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:05.822 --> 00:21:18.106]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:18.526 --> 00:21:18.926]  The U.S.
[00:21:18.966 --> 00:21:24.548]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:24.948 --> 00:21:27.149]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:30.069]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:21:30.109 --> 00:21:32.970]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:39.112]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:21:39.533 --> 00:21:42.874]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:49.296]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:21:49.856 --> 00:21:53.881]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.

[00:21:54.201 --> 00:21:54.401]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.642]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:05.263 --> 00:22:14.213]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.654 --> 00:22:21.842]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.555 --> 00:22:28.061]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:03.680]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:09.001]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:23:09.161 --> 00:23:10.502]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:23:10.782 --> 00:23:18.944]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:24.906]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:25.066 --> 00:23:26.848]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:26.908 --> 00:23:29.049]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:29.069 --> 00:23:33.453]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:33.633 --> 00:23:35.795]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:23:35.855 --> 00:23:42.841]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular
[00:23:44.753 --> 00:23:45.433]  We're good to go.
[00:24:10.712 --> 00:24:15.034]  Coming up next hour, I'm going to get into the economy in detail.
[00:24:15.054 --> 00:24:17.675]  There's been a lot of just huge new developments.
[00:24:19.136 --> 00:24:21.937]  You've got the stock market going up, the yuppies think they've been saved.
[00:24:21.957 --> 00:24:31.902]  This is only so the central bankers can have the illusion of trying to help and trying to quote fix things before they have their giant consolidation that's already underway.
[00:24:31.922 --> 00:24:36.564]  And if you notice, they're already cautioning people and basically admitting that.
[00:24:37.604 --> 00:24:38.825]  So we will go over all that.
[00:24:40.643 --> 00:24:47.488]  If you go up on PrisonPlanet.com, if it's not posted yet, we're in the process of posting it right now.
[00:24:47.508 --> 00:24:52.531]  I have this report right here out of Indiana.
[00:24:53.852 --> 00:24:55.954]  Roseland residents frustrated.
[00:24:56.474 --> 00:24:58.415]  Now, in fact, John, I forgot to ask.
[00:24:58.435 --> 00:25:00.757]  Do you have that audio clip of them beating up the city council member?
[00:25:03.019 --> 00:25:04.640]  Okay, so we're in the process of getting that.
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:04.920]  Okay.
[00:25:06.264 --> 00:25:08.166]  Roseland residents frustrated.
[00:25:08.246 --> 00:25:24.719]  Now the story here isn't that the chief of police punches the city council member who is there giving a speech about how the police are corrupt and about how they're involved in all sorts of corruption and that happens in mid-sized towns and small towns all the time where cops literally take over.
[00:25:24.759 --> 00:25:30.204]  Sometimes they kill the mayor and sometimes the mayor runs the cops and it literally becomes boss hog.
[00:25:30.908 --> 00:25:35.649]  And you see that in the news all the time, or one sheriff wins, the other sheriff's mad and has him killed.
[00:25:36.129 --> 00:25:38.569]  I mean, I saw that like three times already this year.
[00:25:39.389 --> 00:25:41.950]  For those that don't understand that, it's rampant, okay?
[00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.170]  These guys take over small towns, they think they're God.
[00:25:46.031 --> 00:25:58.553]  And in this clip, and you've got to go watch the video, what's amazing about this is that the city councilman, the mayor just screams and says, get out of here.
[00:25:58.873 --> 00:26:00.053]  This is city council video.
[00:26:01.252 --> 00:26:02.053]  And he says, OK.
[00:26:03.054 --> 00:26:03.995]  And he starts walking out.
[00:26:04.035 --> 00:26:06.417]  This is the elected representative being told to get out by the mayor.
[00:26:08.699 --> 00:26:12.202]  And the head cop punches him.
[00:26:12.803 --> 00:26:14.144]  Punches him right in the back!
[00:26:14.684 --> 00:26:15.846]  The guy falls over.
[00:26:17.127 --> 00:26:22.932]  People with handheld cameras run over and videotape as the police, for it's gotta be 45 seconds.
[00:26:24.398 --> 00:26:27.659]  Just pound and pound and pound.
[00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:29.079]  And this is an old man.
[00:26:29.099 --> 00:26:30.840]  The city council guy looks like he's probably 70.
[00:26:32.661 --> 00:26:37.422]  I mean, this other cop is full force pounding him on the side of the head.
[00:26:37.822 --> 00:26:39.823]  And the news calls it a fight!
[00:26:40.403 --> 00:26:48.465]  So next time a woman gets raped, if somebody breaks into your house and at knife point rapes you, when the cops show up, I guess it's called just a consensual relationship.
[00:26:49.966 --> 00:26:53.827]  Or the next time somebody gets mugged, I guess the cops will call it a fight.
[00:26:56.457 --> 00:26:57.177]  Here's the audio.
[00:26:57.197 --> 00:26:59.219]  We don't have time to play it all, but here's most of it.
[00:26:59.459 --> 00:27:00.479]  This is off the local news.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.241]  Some residents in Roseland are fed up.
[00:27:03.281 --> 00:27:06.963]  They say they've had it with the behavior displayed at recent town council meetings.
[00:27:07.023 --> 00:27:08.744]  Good evening, I'm Terry McFadden.
[00:27:08.904 --> 00:27:10.124]  And I'm Maureen McFadden.
[00:27:10.164 --> 00:27:18.629]  In case you missed it, a fight was caught on tape Friday between a Roseland town council member and a police officer, and that's leading some to wonder where the town's democratic process has gone.
[00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:22.111]  NewsCenter 16's Sarah Platt joins us live from the newsroom with a closer look.
[00:27:22.151 --> 00:27:22.411]  Sarah?
[00:27:23.052 --> 00:27:29.761]  Well, Terri, whether people live in or outside of Roseland, so far at least a thousand viewers have commented on last Friday's incident.
[00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:32.324]  Those who live in Roseland say enough is enough.
[00:27:32.824 --> 00:27:38.532]  And they enjoy living in the community, but say the recent behavior at town council meetings is tarnishing the quality of life.
[00:27:41.445 --> 00:27:44.566]  Julia Koritz is a 43-year resident of Roseland.
[00:27:44.706 --> 00:27:51.088]  She likes living here but is fed up, especially over the most recent incident at the town council meeting Friday night.
[00:27:51.648 --> 00:27:51.749]  Out!
[00:27:51.809 --> 00:27:53.229]  Parliamentary procedure!
[00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.789]  Out!
[00:27:53.849 --> 00:27:57.490]  Shortly after David Snyder was kicked out of the meeting, a fight broke out.
[00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.252]  Our cameras caught Marshall Jack Tiller bringing down David Snyder.
[00:28:01.272 --> 00:28:04.313]  Stop right there!
[00:28:05.673 --> 00:28:06.794]  Now this is Orwellian.
[00:28:06.854 --> 00:28:07.894]  I mean this is doublespeak.
[00:28:07.914 --> 00:28:10.835]  They treat you like you're literally have like
[00:28:11.849 --> 00:28:13.250]  He's got an IQ at room temperature.
[00:28:16.213 --> 00:28:17.033]  They tell him to leave.
[00:28:17.053 --> 00:28:17.774]  He stands up.
[00:28:17.814 --> 00:28:18.695]  He's not resisting.
[00:28:18.755 --> 00:28:22.718]  He's walking out, which I really believe a mayor can't kick a councilman out.
[00:28:24.639 --> 00:28:26.100]  He's walking being polite.
[00:28:28.182 --> 00:28:33.466]  He turns around and the cop punches him right in the back and then jumps on him and starts beating him up.
[00:28:34.007 --> 00:28:39.331]  So they call it a fight and then say he brought him down like it's good.
[00:28:40.603 --> 00:28:42.965]  And that reminds me of New Orleans during the gun confiscation.
[00:28:43.866 --> 00:28:52.033]  They're slamming people on the ground, they're taking their guns in their homes, and then it says they were not there to arrest anyone, and they were not using force.
[00:28:52.453 --> 00:28:59.299]  And then it would show them... They're training you to see idiocy and just accept false information.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.101]  Back it up a few seconds.
[00:29:02.141 --> 00:29:04.883]  I mean, when you watch this video, I'm going to make sure it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:04.903 --> 00:29:07.786]  I know I am to Ryan Slickhauser and InfoWars and
[00:29:08.388 --> 00:29:09.369]  Paul of our prison planet.
[00:29:09.829 --> 00:29:11.771]  If it's not posted in the next few minutes, I'll make sure it is.
[00:29:12.712 --> 00:29:14.293]  But we have a bunch of these videos.
[00:29:15.954 --> 00:29:16.475]  Go back to it.
[00:29:17.295 --> 00:29:17.436]  Out!
[00:29:17.456 --> 00:29:18.837]  Parliamentary procedure!
[00:29:19.297 --> 00:29:19.437]  Out!
[00:29:19.497 --> 00:29:23.120]  Shortly after David Snyder was kicked out of the meeting, a fight broke out.
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.863]  Our cameras caught Marshall Jack Miller bringing down David Snyder.
[00:29:27.204 --> 00:29:28.985]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:29:29.065 --> 00:29:31.947]  Oh, by the way, on the video, there's other
[00:29:38.212 --> 00:29:40.594]  Off-duty cops, while they're beating him, going, get him!
[00:29:41.034 --> 00:29:41.434]  Get him!
[00:29:41.494 --> 00:29:41.815]  Yeah!
[00:29:42.095 --> 00:29:42.735]  Oh, get him!
[00:29:43.836 --> 00:29:46.198]  I mean, he's on the ground, there's people staring, going, get him, get him!
[00:29:46.238 --> 00:29:46.938]  Just beating him!
[00:29:47.338 --> 00:29:49.420]  I mean, they're gonna put the cops in thrones soon!
[00:29:51.721 --> 00:29:52.642]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.122 --> 00:29:54.703]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.644 --> 00:29:58.326]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:02.270]  Hey, Emily!
[00:30:02.551 --> 00:30:03.411]  Wow, you look great!
[00:30:03.631 --> 00:30:04.432]  I feel great!
[00:30:04.672 --> 00:30:06.473]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[00:30:06.734 --> 00:30:07.054]  Really?
[00:30:07.274 --> 00:30:07.694]  What is it?
[00:30:07.894 --> 00:30:08.375]  How does it work?
[00:30:08.575 --> 00:30:15.159]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[00:30:15.299 --> 00:30:17.601]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:30:17.801 --> 00:30:23.125]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:30:23.445 --> 00:30:23.925]  That's it?
[00:30:24.205 --> 00:30:25.746]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:30:25.986 --> 00:30:26.706]  It is easy.
[00:30:26.906 --> 00:30:33.629]  Plus the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:30:33.889 --> 00:30:35.409]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:36.430]  That's amazing!
[00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:42.212]  And the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:30:42.492 --> 00:30:42.832]  Well, how?
[00:30:43.053 --> 00:30:44.154]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[00:30:44.434 --> 00:30:47.276]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.

[00:31:01.744 --> 00:31:03.286]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.

[00:31:17.987 --> 00:31:21.629]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs.

[00:32:01.758 --> 00:32:03.699]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach!
[00:32:04.139 --> 00:32:04.420]  Look!
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:05.880]  Up there in the sky!
[00:32:06.301 --> 00:32:07.601]  It's Non-X-Man!
[00:32:08.002 --> 00:32:09.122]  He's in a dive!
[00:32:09.142 --> 00:32:11.464]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[00:32:11.764 --> 00:32:12.524]  Let's go look.
[00:32:14.746 --> 00:32:17.927]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[00:32:18.348 --> 00:32:19.668]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[00:32:19.688 --> 00:32:20.329]  Take them out.
[00:32:20.965 --> 00:32:21.646]  Let's see.
[00:32:21.666 --> 00:32:26.250]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:27.070]  Don't worry.
[00:32:27.511 --> 00:32:29.032]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:32:29.652 --> 00:32:34.076]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[00:32:34.617 --> 00:32:36.658]  Oh, I will Non-X Man.
[00:32:36.798 --> 00:32:39.481]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[00:32:41.633 --> 00:32:44.275]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[00:32:44.735 --> 00:32:48.217]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[00:32:48.738 --> 00:32:59.865]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[00:33:14.107 --> 00:33:25.936]  You know, the media is saying that Andrew Meyer, the student, because he put up some joke YouTube videos.
[00:33:27.517 --> 00:33:29.358]  I put up joke YouTube videos.
[00:33:30.119 --> 00:33:34.022]  Does that mean the cops get to taser me when I'm not resisting and five of them are sitting on me?
[00:33:34.382 --> 00:33:40.047]  But I guess this woman, in a wheelchair, who was schizophrenic,
[00:33:41.325 --> 00:33:48.607]  All the time they're tasering people who are mentally ill or deaf or blind or who've been in a car wreck and you get out and you're stumbling around.
[00:33:48.627 --> 00:33:49.447]  They just taser you now.
[00:33:49.507 --> 00:33:55.509]  It's kind of like if you don't submit and literally bow down instantly to God, which is now the government, it's over.
[00:33:56.409 --> 00:33:57.250]  But here it is.
[00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:59.770]  A wheelchair-bound woman dies for being shocked with tasers.
[00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:05.772]  It says that they tasered her for a continual two minutes at least.
[00:34:06.532 --> 00:34:09.513]  At least ten times with multiple taser guns into her body.
[00:34:10.208 --> 00:34:16.030]  And they kept telling her to submit, and to comply, and to put her hands behind her back.
[00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:20.191]  Now, of course, you can't do that while they're shocking you, but it's a little sick joke.
[00:34:20.631 --> 00:34:27.152]  Remember yesterday, we played the clip from UCLA, where they tasered him, and a few seconds later, they say, now get up!
[00:34:27.933 --> 00:34:30.833]  And you can't even talk, and then later, when they taser him again, he starts screaming.
[00:34:31.534 --> 00:34:32.994]  And people are saying, he can't get up!
[00:34:33.494 --> 00:34:37.175]  They tasered him six times in a minute and a half.
[00:34:40.942 --> 00:34:42.762]  And it's just like when you're chained down in the hospital bed.
[00:34:42.782 --> 00:34:43.943]  We want you to give a urine sample.
[00:34:44.083 --> 00:34:44.463]  I can't.
[00:34:44.663 --> 00:34:45.243]  I'm not going to.
[00:34:45.943 --> 00:34:47.003]  Oh, there's no Fifth Amendment.
[00:34:47.024 --> 00:34:48.124]  You have to incriminate yourself.
[00:34:48.564 --> 00:34:50.064]  Bring in the teaser!
[00:34:50.424 --> 00:34:52.665]  See, torture is being institutionalized.
[00:34:53.025 --> 00:34:59.426]  And in the end of my film, in the extras for Martial Law, I have the police breaking demonstrators' arms on purpose.
[00:34:59.446 --> 00:35:00.127]  They're authorized.
[00:35:00.167 --> 00:35:01.447]  They say, we are allowed to break arms.
[00:35:01.807 --> 00:35:06.048]  And they take the nunchuck and twist it till the compound fracture, the bone pops out.
[00:35:06.488 --> 00:35:09.749]  Nice little pink bone popping out of the arm, and the cops
[00:35:10.349 --> 00:35:12.050]  All right, good job team leader.
[00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.370]  All right, let's break the next arm.
[00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:19.973]  Multiple arms on video being broken and the cops on the news saying, hey, we're allowed to break arms.
[00:35:20.333 --> 00:35:22.274]  You don't get up and get in the paddy wagon.
[00:35:22.514 --> 00:35:26.535]  We're gonna break your arm till the bone sticks out!
[00:35:27.375 --> 00:35:29.376]  Life-threatening assault!
[00:35:29.996 --> 00:35:31.617]  And we've got machine guns!
[00:35:32.137 --> 00:35:34.618]  And let me tell you something, council members, you don't like it.
[00:35:34.778 --> 00:35:36.279]  We'll punch you right in the back.
[00:35:36.799 --> 00:35:37.819]  We'll waylay you.
[00:35:37.879 --> 00:35:39.140]  We'll Shanghai you.
[00:35:40.569 --> 00:35:43.910]  We'll bushwhack you and we'll beat you up right in front of everybody.
[00:35:44.251 --> 00:35:47.992]  And the local media will then say that you attacked us.
[00:35:49.293 --> 00:35:50.813]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up about all this.
[00:35:50.873 --> 00:35:57.396]  It's just... Notice that 9-11 happened and then all of a sudden they were just tasering and beating everyone up, see?
[00:35:57.796 --> 00:35:59.117]  It isn't about terrorists.
[00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:00.998]  It's about a new umbrella of tyranny.
[00:36:01.298 --> 00:36:06.720]  A new darkness doubling and then tripling the police just running around feeding on us everywhere.
[00:36:08.979 --> 00:36:16.725]  But then selectively enforcing and not stopping illegal aliens and not making them have IDs and letting them have houses without any type of ID.
[00:36:18.769 --> 00:36:20.590]  But not you, not the Cattle Americans.
[00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:25.934]  You're there to be fed on, and if you don't do what you're told, we'll bully the eye and fracture you!
[00:36:25.994 --> 00:36:27.295]  We won't stop when it breaks!
[00:36:27.515 --> 00:36:30.877]  We'll fully twist until the bone rotates out of the meat!
[00:36:31.277 --> 00:36:33.459]  We might as well just rip your whole arm off!
[00:36:33.559 --> 00:36:37.121]  How about we just take a gun, and just stick it right to the back of your head, and just start pulling the trigger?
[00:36:37.482 --> 00:36:38.842]  In fact, I was watching that video two days ago.
[00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:39.883]  I haven't even talked about that.
[00:36:40.203 --> 00:36:40.864]  The guy's in a...
[00:36:41.845 --> 00:36:45.891]  In handcuffs, on his stomach, just at some party for people drinking, teenagers drinking.
[00:36:46.151 --> 00:36:46.932]  No one's resisting.
[00:36:47.093 --> 00:36:54.022]  The cop pulls his gun out, it fires into his leg, so he throws a fit and guns the guy down and the cop didn't get in trouble.
[00:36:54.303 --> 00:36:55.985]  I just feel like killing somebody!
[00:36:56.386 --> 00:36:56.927]  Oh yeah!
[00:37:00.405 --> 00:37:03.767]  Maybe we'll start having holidays where the cops are allowed to just hunt us.
[00:37:04.087 --> 00:37:07.710]  And they can just line us up like Planet of the Apes and just walk by and just shoot us.
[00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:08.810]  I feel bad today!
[00:37:09.091 --> 00:37:09.611]  Die!
[00:37:09.911 --> 00:37:10.892]  I feel bad today!
[00:37:11.212 --> 00:37:11.912]  Die!
[00:37:14.514 --> 00:37:17.396]  And see, the new system is they let them do it.
[00:37:17.436 --> 00:37:18.717]  They're allowed to do it.
[00:37:19.517 --> 00:37:22.519]  Here in Austin, for sport, they shoot black guys in the back all the time.
[00:37:23.059 --> 00:37:26.782]  And there's all this propaganda and all this bull, unarmed black guys running away.
[00:37:27.623 --> 00:37:28.704]  Ah, just gun him down.
[00:37:29.005 --> 00:37:31.006]  Retarded black guy, gun him down.
[00:37:31.707 --> 00:37:33.008]  He's black, just kill him.
[00:37:33.028 --> 00:37:34.970]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.952]  Josh Goldman, I ain't got to go to class in ten minutes.
[00:37:37.272 --> 00:37:43.078]  You led the demonstration yesterday there at the college with others, and you're also a listener to the show.
[00:37:43.118 --> 00:37:43.838]  We're honored to have you.
[00:37:43.878 --> 00:37:47.322]  Josh Goldman, what is really going on right now with the media response?
[00:37:47.382 --> 00:37:50.425]  What happened to your friend Andrew Meyer?
[00:37:50.485 --> 00:37:51.686]  You've got the floor, break it down.
[00:37:52.685 --> 00:38:16.575]  Okay, basically, uh, he went to the Kerry forum, um, with the intention of asking some serious questions that the media, uh, won't ever bring up, uh, including, uh, Kerry conceding immediately, not, not wanting to look into lost vote, uh, he brought up the, uh, stolen crossbones issue with, with both him and Bush both being members, and, uh,
[00:38:17.403 --> 00:38:20.425]  Basically, his questions weren't tolerated.
[00:38:20.525 --> 00:38:34.896]  They didn't want to give him a chance to speak, and even though Senator Kerry appeared to want to answer, the organizers of the event ordered the police to intervene, and the result is what you've all seen on YouTube.
[00:38:35.857 --> 00:38:47.246]  And that's the point, is that now that the media, Democrats, Republicans, CNN, Fox, are all saying it's good, this now sets the precedent that when you ask questions, you're going to be tasered.
[00:38:48.289 --> 00:38:50.850]  I mean, Luke Radowski, they claimed he had bombs.
[00:38:51.231 --> 00:38:52.591]  They've had people follow him.
[00:38:52.911 --> 00:38:54.152]  People try to get their cameras.
[00:38:54.192 --> 00:38:56.513]  We just had cops try to beat up my cameraman.
[00:38:57.034 --> 00:39:00.475]  A gang of more than 20 cops just hitting him and pushing him and breaking the camera.
[00:39:00.715 --> 00:39:01.856]  I mean, this is the new America.
[00:39:02.096 --> 00:39:03.257]  Tell us about the demonstration.
[00:39:04.737 --> 00:39:10.901]  The demonstration, I was really amazed at how many people came out, considering this is all happening so quickly.
[00:39:10.921 --> 00:39:15.403]  It was about 200 people protesting police brutality.
[00:39:16.318 --> 00:39:43.671]  uh... protesting uh... the cop cycling uh... first amendment rights freedom of speech and we actually march over to Emerson the uh... alumni building where the president of UF was at the time and staged a sit-in and there was about two hundred students uh... sitting inside the building which and they they tried to put up a fight and not let us in but we got in there and uh... they ended up speaking with the president of this university who who
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:51.745]  Uh, you know, covering his own ass, went on to say that, uh, they'd look into it, they'd investigate, and that, uh, Andrew Meyer wouldn't be in trouble with the university.
[00:39:52.585 --> 00:39:56.088]  Uh, however, uh, no one, no one's nearly getting in touch with Andrew right now.
[00:39:56.108 --> 00:40:08.176]  Uh, it, it's my belief and the belief of, of his friends that, uh, his lawyers are telling him to stay out of the media, that, uh, to pretty much hide from the law, and his, and actually his Facebook profile has been removed.
[00:40:08.832 --> 00:40:13.933]  So that just, you know, that leads me to believe the lawyers are just trying to completely get him out of the way.
[00:40:13.953 --> 00:40:25.315]  Their business, if the lawyer isn't a family friend who went to college with your dad or your mother, and this is how it works, they tell you to shut up, they end up taking you through a lengthy court process.
[00:40:25.856 --> 00:40:32.437]  Now, remember the woman who, and the man who had the upside-down American flag and the Ron Paul stuff, and the cop came and beat him up inside their house?
[00:40:33.246 --> 00:40:36.810]  I told them, fire the lawyer, stand up, they did, they defeated them, they won, they dropped it.
[00:40:37.051 --> 00:40:43.899]  Remember the guy who had the video camera who was a listener in the car and they charged him with eavesdropping with felonies and were laughing, you're going to prison.
[00:40:44.099 --> 00:40:45.841]  Well now that cop's in trouble and they dropped it.
[00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:48.144]  When you go quietly, they win.
[00:40:48.964 --> 00:40:51.006]  And he clearly did nothing wrong.
[00:40:51.046 --> 00:40:52.526]  He was trying to leave the building.
[00:40:52.987 --> 00:40:54.548]  He just wanted them to take their hands off.
[00:40:54.588 --> 00:40:55.628]  He was only pulling away.
[00:40:55.648 --> 00:40:59.211]  He was not resisting their godliness, their holinesses.
[00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:05.935]  And then they had him totally restrained when they tasered him and he begged not to be tasered.
[00:41:06.355 --> 00:41:18.519]  And just because he's a college student that made some joke YouTube videos about Harry Potter, doesn't mean that he doesn't have a First Amendment right, and doesn't mean that they didn't first put their hands on him and assault him before even asking him to leave, grabbing on him.
[00:41:18.919 --> 00:41:22.761]  Now what do you think of the media spin, now they're trying to claim that this is a wonderful thing?
[00:41:24.981 --> 00:41:28.963]  The media doesn't have this accurately at all.
[00:41:30.427 --> 00:41:36.853]  Some people are saying that the police had the right to taser him because he was going to incite a riot or something to that effect.
[00:41:36.913 --> 00:41:38.535]  Oh yeah, now talking, see?
[00:41:38.755 --> 00:41:39.816]  Oh, talking!
[00:41:39.896 --> 00:41:41.177]  You're not allowed to tase people!
[00:41:42.198 --> 00:41:42.919]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:51.167]  And the thing was that, you know, Andrew Meyer, he went to that forum and sat through almost two hours of John Terry speaking.
[00:41:51.187 --> 00:41:53.670]  And if anyone's seen John Terry speaking, it's not all that...
[00:41:54.446 --> 00:41:54.987]  Enlightening.
[00:41:55.027 --> 00:41:59.951]  And so, two hours of that, waiting to ask his question, and then they try and deny his right.
[00:42:00.031 --> 00:42:00.692]  And, you know what?
[00:42:01.172 --> 00:42:08.139]  Any person in that situation who has cops grabbing on them for absolutely no reason would react the same way.
[00:42:08.299 --> 00:42:09.240]  Well, listen, I've been there.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:18.989]  I asked Bush calmly, politely, at the end of his speech, because he'd been given the same speech for months, they said they were going to have a press conference, I went there, then they said, no press conference, here's his speech,
[00:42:19.808 --> 00:42:22.909]  And at the end, I asked my questions, and they almost broke my arm off.
[00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.550]  They told me I was going to be charged.
[00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:25.791]  The cops were laughing at me.
[00:42:26.011 --> 00:42:27.391]  You're going to get it now, boy.
[00:42:28.612 --> 00:42:31.793]  Because that's what they think America is about, is arresting you for speech.
[00:42:32.194 --> 00:42:34.395]  And then the Bush campaign said, no, let him go.
[00:42:34.995 --> 00:42:39.337]  But after they drove me around for an hour, I almost, you know, wet my pants because I
[00:42:40.655 --> 00:42:42.436]  I've been sitting there for hours waiting for Bush to get there.
[00:42:42.476 --> 00:42:42.977]  He was late.
[00:42:43.037 --> 00:42:44.958]  Then I didn't want to leave once he got there during the speech.
[00:42:45.398 --> 00:42:46.819]  I was wanting to go to the bathroom.
[00:42:46.979 --> 00:42:47.480]  Side issue.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.961]  The point is, is they wouldn't let me pull over, go to a bathroom.
[00:42:50.322 --> 00:42:51.342]  It was all real funny.
[00:42:52.203 --> 00:42:54.965]  And that's how these guys operate.
[00:42:55.565 --> 00:42:56.966]  But I'm lucky they didn't taser me.
[00:42:57.026 --> 00:42:58.807]  Listen, that was seven years ago.
[00:42:59.628 --> 00:43:01.129]  They probably taser me now.
[00:43:03.411 --> 00:43:09.675]  Yeah, and the whole thing with the taser is that if you watch the video, he is clearly restrained.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:18.765]  He, like you said, he said that he would voluntarily leave if they got off of him and instead they opted to use a taser and, uh...
[00:43:20.336 --> 00:43:22.958]  Look at all the backlash that this is creating.
[00:43:22.998 --> 00:43:29.862]  People saying, you know, police are overstepping their boundaries and I think that's a good thing, a good issue that's being brought up.
[00:43:30.122 --> 00:43:34.664]  Have you seen the video out of Indiana where the cops assault the city councilman?
[00:43:34.905 --> 00:43:40.328]  He never hits them and then the news calls it a fight and says, for the councilman getting in a fight,
[00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:43.230]  The chief took him down.
[00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:48.294]  The chief punches him in the back, jumps on his back, punches him in the head for like a minute and a half.
[00:43:48.714 --> 00:43:51.336]  The guy's unconscious, and then they call him a hero.
[00:43:51.777 --> 00:43:57.541]  I mean, this is like, they're going to be guillotining us soon, and then charging us for guillotining ourselves.
[00:43:57.601 --> 00:44:01.845]  I mean, it's literal cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs at this point.
[00:44:03.058 --> 00:44:29.470]  Yeah, and I just want to mention that also Andrew Meyer, he is a 9-11 truther, he has distributed 9-11 truth material on campus, and he is a Ron Paul supporter, distributing Ron Paul campaign information as well, and he's someone who, being a journalist major, he wants to know the truth, he wants to hold politicians and authority figures accountable, and look what happens to him.
[00:44:31.164 --> 00:44:47.121]  Well, 90% of the time, and I've seen this in hundreds of cases, if he grovels, if he tries to submit and shuts up, his story won't be anything by Sunday, they're going to throw the book at him, and the school will probably try to suspend him, and the lawyers will get $20,000 of his parents' money.
[00:44:47.361 --> 00:44:48.762]  But hey, they love the system.
[00:44:49.003 --> 00:44:50.544]  Mommy and Daddy think they know it all.
[00:44:50.824 --> 00:44:51.445]  C'est la vie.
[00:44:51.485 --> 00:44:52.166]  Let them have their way.
[00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:56.471]  Yeah, I really wish I could get a hold of him.
[00:44:57.111 --> 00:45:00.333]  As I told you, he's pretty much unreachable, even to his friends.
[00:45:00.433 --> 00:45:01.353]  I've been to his house.
[00:45:01.573 --> 00:45:03.354]  His roommates don't really know where he is.
[00:45:03.854 --> 00:45:10.337]  He's only in contact with one or two of his really close friends who work with his website.
[00:45:11.017 --> 00:45:17.140]  And if you go to his website, you'll see they're trying to advertise protests and they're trying to rally support for him.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:18.440]  Now, we've got links to that.
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.241]  Do you have the web address in front of you?
[00:45:20.874 --> 00:45:22.815]  Yes, TheAndrewMeyer.com.
[00:45:23.275 --> 00:45:33.479]  And he has, even on there, he has links to 9-11 Truth and to Zeitgeist, which is a movie that goes on to tell how the world bankers are pulling the strings behind the scenes.
[00:45:34.199 --> 00:45:40.441]  And, you know, other than that, other than his friends updating his website, he has literally disappeared.
[00:45:40.801 --> 00:45:47.684]  And, you know, it's really concerning to me, especially after talking to you, that he disappeared when I think he should be making this
[00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:49.159]  More of an issue.
[00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:50.560]  I think he should be putting the phone down.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:56.643]  He should be all over CNN, all over Fox, all over everywhere saying, hey, it's my first amendment and fighting back.
[00:45:56.703 --> 00:45:58.143]  Instead, he shuts up.
[00:45:58.464 --> 00:46:04.046]  Now they get to go into Spinover Drive and call him a kook and say he's a nut and say he deserves it.
[00:46:04.126 --> 00:46:05.707]  And then the lawyer gets the cash and they win.
[00:46:06.977 --> 00:46:14.504]  Yeah, and it's upsetting, and, you know, Alex, I really hope that someone can get through to him on speaking up.
[00:46:14.524 --> 00:46:18.688]  It was rumored yesterday that he would be doing something on CNN.
[00:46:18.788 --> 00:46:22.332]  This was about, I'd say about 1 o'clock in the afternoon during the protest.
[00:46:23.453 --> 00:46:26.856]  The woman who he gave his camera to to videotape him doing this
[00:46:27.603 --> 00:46:35.047]  Uh, came up to me and said, uh, they're doing a CNN piece tonight, uh, where I'm gonna hand him his camera and Andrew Meyer's gonna speak.
[00:46:35.667 --> 00:46:42.711]  And seven o'clock comes around and the news vans are pulling away saying, you know, this guy, Andrew Meyer, is completely shut in.
[00:46:43.271 --> 00:46:45.052]  He's not coming to talk to any of the media.
[00:46:45.252 --> 00:46:47.053]  Total, total, total mistake.
[00:46:47.617 --> 00:46:56.305]  But again, you've got a local lawyer who's friends with the cops and it's going to be, you just go along now boy, I'll take it, give me the cash, there you go.
[00:46:56.825 --> 00:46:58.107]  Now you're on probation.
[00:46:58.997 --> 00:47:11.944]  Another troubling thing is that the young woman who actually videotaped this, he didn't know her, and she was speaking with me saying, you know, I told him I was his friend, I said, give me the camera, I'll get it back to him, and what she said was, no, I'm going to hold on to it.
[00:47:12.305 --> 00:47:23.491]  She ends up going on MSNBC, talking about how he was stepping out of line, and then she ended up calling me back and saying that she turned the camera into someone.
[00:47:23.811 --> 00:47:25.432]  She wouldn't tell me who she turned it into.
[00:47:25.472 --> 00:47:26.593]  I said, did you turn it into the cops?
[00:47:26.633 --> 00:47:26.913]  She said,
[00:47:27.393 --> 00:47:33.815]  She said, I didn't turn it into the cops, I didn't turn it into lawyers, and I didn't give it back to Andrew Meyer, but I returned it to who it belonged to.
[00:47:34.455 --> 00:47:38.676]  And that just makes me wonder who intervened and has that camera now.
[00:47:38.696 --> 00:47:39.996]  So now whose camera was it?
[00:47:40.756 --> 00:47:42.396]  It belonged to Andrew Meyer.
[00:47:42.797 --> 00:47:48.858]  Ah, but then he gives it to her, and she runs and tattles and says he's bad on TV, and won't say where the camera is.
[00:47:49.602 --> 00:47:52.665]  Nope, so she didn't tell me where the camera was.
[00:47:52.685 --> 00:47:57.971]  She said it had something to do with legality issues that she couldn't tell me who she handed the camera over.
[00:47:58.011 --> 00:48:00.233]  Well that's because most Americans don't know where the U.S.
[00:48:00.314 --> 00:48:02.576]  is on a map and so they just tell her.
[00:48:02.636 --> 00:48:04.558]  It's a mumbo-jumbo legal.
[00:48:04.999 --> 00:48:06.280]  Let me just make this all real simple.
[00:48:07.674 --> 00:48:08.815]  He was in there speaking.
[00:48:08.915 --> 00:48:10.896]  The cops grabbed on him forcefully.
[00:48:10.916 --> 00:48:15.598]  He simply said, hey, don't do that because see, they think they're allowed to assault us.
[00:48:16.279 --> 00:48:19.700]  In New York, we have the cops come up and push on us and tell us what to do.
[00:48:21.081 --> 00:48:26.524]  I mean, you touch one of them, you're going to prison for five years, but they're allowed to push and shove you.
[00:48:26.544 --> 00:48:27.945]  And they come over and grab him.
[00:48:27.965 --> 00:48:29.105]  He says, fine, I'm leaving.
[00:48:29.165 --> 00:48:30.246]  He's trying to walk out.
[00:48:30.686 --> 00:48:36.311]  And the big black cop just grabs him and bear hugs him and the guy, and then he drops him and he goes, what are you doing?
[00:48:36.431 --> 00:48:36.692]  Boom!
[00:48:36.732 --> 00:48:37.512]  They grab him again.
[00:48:38.053 --> 00:48:39.034]  They're little snakes.
[00:48:39.094 --> 00:48:39.955]  They love power.
[00:48:39.995 --> 00:48:41.716]  They got gang tats all over them.
[00:48:41.976 --> 00:48:44.759]  They're grabbing all over every side of him like he's a bear.
[00:48:45.239 --> 00:48:47.161]  And then he's trying to get out the door.
[00:48:47.221 --> 00:48:47.802]  They grab him.
[00:48:47.902 --> 00:48:48.603]  Uh-uh, buddy.
[00:48:48.823 --> 00:48:53.227]  And then once they got him held down, they pull that taser out right in front of his face and go, you see this?
[00:48:53.667 --> 00:48:54.549]  He's like, no, bro.
[00:48:54.569 --> 00:48:56.051]  And they went, yeah, I got the power.
[00:48:56.452 --> 00:48:59.177]  I may be paid minimum wage, but I got power.
[00:48:59.377 --> 00:49:00.980]  Now have the death of the country!
[00:49:02.182 --> 00:49:03.043]  And that's what they do.
[00:49:03.083 --> 00:49:04.446]  They love being scum.
[00:49:04.486 --> 00:49:05.487]  They love being evil.
[00:49:05.768 --> 00:49:06.629]  Anything else, sir?
[00:49:07.662 --> 00:49:19.926]  Yeah, I'm just going to close with, I just want to remind people that, uh, he didn't do anything illegal, uh, and therefore I don't understand how they can charge him with resisting arrest when he didn't do any kind of arrestable offense.
[00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:22.267]  He was assaulted by the police.
[00:49:22.687 --> 00:49:23.808]  He was assaulted.
[00:49:24.008 --> 00:49:30.050]  Look, we got a city council member clearly being jumped from the back by a cop, and then they say he started a fight.
[00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:38.898]  Yeah, so I just want people, if people out there do think that that was coming to them, I just want them to know that the police assaulted him.
[00:49:39.679 --> 00:49:44.724]  That, you know, people will say that he shouldn't have been up there asking those questions.
[00:49:44.784 --> 00:49:49.309]  Well, you know, it's First Amendment rights and the cops don't have the right to assault people.
[00:49:51.531 --> 00:49:54.314]  Then he gave his camera to some girl and she just won't say where it is.
[00:49:55.057 --> 00:49:55.537]  Nope.
[00:49:56.478 --> 00:50:03.540]  And that also concerns me because that was a good camera that had probably a good amount of footage from other things as well on it.
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:08.301]  And she becomes in possession of it and now she says she turned it over.
[00:50:08.662 --> 00:50:09.922]  Won't say who she turned it over to.
[00:50:09.942 --> 00:50:10.882]  Well, it was to the cops.
[00:50:10.902 --> 00:50:11.603]  You know who she did.
[00:50:12.203 --> 00:50:13.963]  Guaranteed she walked up and knelt.
[00:50:14.283 --> 00:50:16.144]  The cop grunted at her and she said, thank you.
[00:50:16.444 --> 00:50:17.444]  I love being a slave.
[00:50:18.025 --> 00:50:18.585]  Guaranteed.
[00:50:19.571 --> 00:50:26.275]  I mean, let me tell you, these people will march into... We've all seen the footage of World War II where people are ordered to run into those pits and be shot in the back of the head.
[00:50:26.955 --> 00:50:29.056]  I mean, what red-blooded American wouldn't fight back?
[00:50:29.116 --> 00:50:31.217]  Well, today, they would go into those pits.
[00:50:31.777 --> 00:50:34.379]  They'd throw their babies into ovens if they were ordered to.
[00:50:34.399 --> 00:50:36.220]  Let me talk to you, Mr. Gold, during the break.
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.460]  I know you've got class coming up.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:42.503]  I want to see if we can hold you over to talk about, for five more minutes, about the demonstrations that are coming up, and a lot more.
[00:50:42.603 --> 00:50:43.343]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:43.363 --> 00:50:43.783]  Stay with me.
[00:50:53.883 --> 00:50:59.329]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:07.358]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:08.041 --> 00:51:15.104]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:15.504 --> 00:51:26.929]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:27.229 --> 00:51:30.791]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:31.191 --> 00:51:33.172]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:33.472 --> 00:51:37.294]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:51:50.777 --> 00:51:51.538]  Terrorism!
[00:51:51.698 --> 00:51:52.418]  Terrorism!
[00:51:52.538 --> 00:51:58.622]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:51:58.882 --> 00:52:00.463]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:52:00.703 --> 00:52:03.185]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:03.585 --> 00:52:18.154]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:18.194 --> 00:52:18.514]  government.
[00:52:18.674 --> 00:52:20.475]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:52:20.855 --> 00:52:26.757]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:31.398]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:52:50.345 --> 00:52:53.288]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:52:53.448 --> 00:52:58.654]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:52:58.974 --> 00:53:04.320]  Even a fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:53:04.701 --> 00:53:05.762]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:06.162 --> 00:53:15.227]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[00:53:51.906 --> 00:53:57.052]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:57.733 --> 00:54:00.076]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:00.096 --> 00:54:03.080]  It's gonna get worse and worse.
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:06.023]  The gang mentality of the police.
[00:54:06.364 --> 00:54:07.766]  The biggest street gang out there.
[00:54:09.622 --> 00:54:13.244]  And it's going to get more and more obvious, and it's just going to be like Romania or Poland.
[00:54:13.264 --> 00:54:17.867]  I heard a talk show host this morning saying there's no way to beat the government, no way to overthrow them.
[00:54:18.467 --> 00:54:21.148]  If it ever comes to that, it's going to be a nightmare, but they will lose.
[00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.849]  They will lose.
[00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:25.030]  I don't want that to happen.
[00:54:25.511 --> 00:54:30.373]  But to say that we've only had one experience of beating tyranny in 1776 is just incorrect.
[00:54:31.094 --> 00:54:31.694]  It's incorrect.
[00:54:33.468 --> 00:54:34.989]  He's got to go to class here in a few minutes.
[00:54:35.469 --> 00:54:36.350]  It's Josh Goldman.
[00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:39.412]  And of course he's friends with Andrew Meyer.
[00:54:39.792 --> 00:54:40.592]  He's been out to his house.
[00:54:40.632 --> 00:54:41.313]  He's not there.
[00:54:41.453 --> 00:54:42.393]  Cell phone's turned off.
[00:54:42.433 --> 00:54:43.053]  We've got the number.
[00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:43.734]  It's turned off.
[00:54:45.175 --> 00:54:46.595]  What about more demonstrations?
[00:54:46.655 --> 00:54:47.816]  What about phone numbers?
[00:54:48.356 --> 00:54:51.518]  I know I'm putting you on the spot to call the administration.
[00:54:52.461 --> 00:55:06.369]  Because Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has done a great story, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, titled, The Meaning of That Kerry Fracas in Florida, and he really breaks it down the best I've seen, just how he was selected by Kerry to ask the question.
[00:55:06.689 --> 00:55:07.709]  He was called upon.
[00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:09.170]  Kerry wouldn't answer.
[00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:10.251]  He said, hey, I want it answered.
[00:55:10.511 --> 00:55:12.392]  And the cops decided the First Amendment was over.
[00:55:13.152 --> 00:55:14.093]  They assaulted him.
[00:55:14.173 --> 00:55:15.674]  He didn't like it, so they tasered him.
[00:55:17.275 --> 00:55:18.555]  How do we demonstrate against this?
[00:55:18.595 --> 00:55:21.237]  How do we stand up against this, Josh Goldman?
[00:55:22.801 --> 00:55:25.902]  Well, the students at UF, they're rallied.
[00:55:26.222 --> 00:55:31.444]  You know, there's a lot of people that want to fight against the tyranny of the government.
[00:55:31.464 --> 00:55:35.725]  They want to fight against the corporations who are controlling the media, etc.
[00:55:36.325 --> 00:55:38.906]  And they didn't really have a rallying point until now.
[00:55:40.466 --> 00:55:44.827]  A lot of the activist groups on campus are rallying around this incident with Andrew Meyer.
[00:55:45.848 --> 00:55:50.909]  We're protesting every day at noon at the Posity Americas on campus.
[00:55:51.750 --> 00:56:03.193]  And we're trying best we can to organize, and we're exchanging information, and really trying to bring all of our causes together so that we're more effective.
[00:56:03.253 --> 00:56:07.774]  And so at noon every day on campus, Positive Americas will be out there protesting.
[00:56:08.795 --> 00:56:13.216]  Are the police stalking around you, or are they backed off?
[00:56:14.276 --> 00:56:16.297]  It's really hard to say this early on.
[00:56:16.377 --> 00:56:18.397]  I'm hoping that this can continue.
[00:56:18.717 --> 00:56:20.858]  I didn't have a chance to get there today because I had class.
[00:56:22.294 --> 00:56:29.600]  Tomorrow, I don't have class at noon, so I'll be there, and I can send you an email, let you know the update on what's going on out there.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:37.466]  The police were definitely hovering around us yesterday for the protest, as well as the media was all there.
[00:56:37.486 --> 00:56:43.451]  I'm not quite sure, I don't think the media really talked about the sit-in that we had.
[00:56:43.471 --> 00:56:45.153]  I don't know if you've heard about the sit-in that we did.
[00:56:47.287 --> 00:56:54.013]  But basically, we took over this administrative building, 200 people inside of it, and we pretty much had a meeting on what we were going to do next.
[00:56:54.673 --> 00:56:55.894]  And yes, the cops were watching.
[00:56:55.934 --> 00:56:56.955]  Yes, there were people watching.
[00:56:56.995 --> 00:57:06.583]  We were trying to be as secretive as possible, but I don't really know what's going to come of this, but hopefully people don't lose hope in protest.
[00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:18.628]  Because, you know, protests really made a difference in the 60s and people say it's a lot different now, it's a lot more of a police state, but we need to keep fighting and we need to keep protesting and stay true to our beliefs so we can be free.
[00:57:19.731 --> 00:57:20.791]  Absolutely, my friend.
[00:57:20.851 --> 00:57:27.574]  I agree with you wholeheartedly, and Josh, I want to thank you for your leadership there at the demonstrations yesterday.
[00:57:27.894 --> 00:57:36.757]  You said about 200 people, and I want to thank you for your friendship, not just to Mr. Meyer, but also to the whole country and the Constitutional Bill of Rights.
[00:57:37.177 --> 00:57:41.639]  I commend you for everything you're doing, and let's get an even bigger Ron Paul slash 9-11 truth.
[00:57:45.141 --> 00:57:47.182]  If they don't like free speech, intensify it.
[00:57:47.523 --> 00:57:48.363]  Set up rallies.
[00:57:48.403 --> 00:57:49.504]  Set up more demonstrations.
[00:57:49.524 --> 00:57:51.105]  Hand out more DVDs.
[00:57:51.165 --> 00:57:52.206]  More 9-11 films.
[00:57:52.566 --> 00:57:57.590]  Let's take that university over in the name of Andrew Meyer.
[00:57:59.071 --> 00:57:59.492]  I agree.
[00:57:59.592 --> 00:58:00.753]  I agree wholeheartedly, Alex Jones.
[00:58:01.373 --> 00:58:02.074]  Thank you, my friend.
[00:58:02.094 --> 00:58:03.415]  We'll talk to you as this develops.
[00:58:04.335 --> 00:58:04.596]  Alright.
[00:58:04.656 --> 00:58:05.176]  Thanks a lot.
[00:58:05.336 --> 00:58:05.756]  Take it easy.
[00:58:05.917 --> 00:58:06.417]  Take care.
[00:58:06.697 --> 00:58:07.298]  Josh Goldman.
[00:58:07.318 --> 00:58:10.260]  Appreciate him contacting us to get him on the show.
[00:58:11.748 --> 00:58:15.310]  Alright, uh, again, it is our listeners out there that are fighting everywhere.
[00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:17.211]  Every time this happens, it turns out they're listeners.
[00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:18.111]  Every time.
[00:58:19.132 --> 00:58:20.232]  Because you're a great people.
[00:58:20.452 --> 00:58:21.353]  And I salute you!
[00:58:22.073 --> 00:58:23.194]  Millions of you out there.
[00:58:24.114 --> 00:58:27.936]  Alright, that video of them beating up a city council member is not on InfoWars yet.
[00:58:28.016 --> 00:58:29.517]  I'm gonna make sure it gets up there right now.
[00:58:30.637 --> 00:58:34.539]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:34.859 --> 00:58:35.660]  Or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.534 --> 00:58:47.195]  Big Brother.
[00:58:47.855 --> 00:58:48.896]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:49.617 --> 00:58:50.778]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:51.399 --> 00:58:52.200]  You want answers?
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.861]  Well, so does he.
[00:58:54.522 --> 00:58:58.326]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:58.706 --> 00:59:02.770]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:04.458 --> 00:59:13.260]  My friends, I know from the last hour you're chomping at the bit to cover the media spin with Andrew Meyer claiming, oh, he made a joke college student YouTube video.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.160]  That means he doesn't have free speech.
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.461]  Senator Kerry calls on him.
[00:59:17.961 --> 00:59:20.681]  They're allowed to beat him up and then taser him when he was trying to leave.
[00:59:21.141 --> 00:59:25.202]  Now they've tasered an old woman in a wheelchair ten times for more than two minutes continually.
[00:59:25.482 --> 00:59:26.822]  She died of cardiac arrest.
[00:59:27.162 --> 00:59:28.323]  They're saying that's a good thing.
[00:59:28.363 --> 00:59:29.843]  The cops are saying it was good what they did.
[00:59:31.098 --> 00:59:35.642]  The 71-year-old woman beat up by the neighborhood cop because her grass was brown.
[00:59:35.922 --> 00:59:39.265]  They're throwing the book at her and the state police investigated and said it was good what he did.
[00:59:39.285 --> 00:59:43.169]  And Abrams saw it, he took her and slammed her face right in the concrete.
[00:59:43.189 --> 00:59:47.372]  He said, listen here, let me show you who's in command, you wench!
[00:59:48.373 --> 00:59:49.594]  And that's what they did.
[00:59:51.016 --> 00:59:53.758]  So, we are seeing a lot of sick things happen.
[00:59:53.778 --> 00:59:58.202]  Here it is, wheelchair-bound woman dies after being shocked with taser ten times.
[00:59:59.048 --> 00:59:59.668]  Here's another one.
[00:59:59.688 --> 01:00:00.429]  This is the headline.
[01:00:00.449 --> 01:00:02.890]  Roseland residents frustrated.
[01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:06.212]  We're going to post this up on InfoWars and PrisonPlanet soon.
[01:00:06.232 --> 01:00:09.313]  It is unbelievable.
[01:00:09.754 --> 01:00:14.596]  The police beat up the city councilman for criticizing them for corruption.
[01:00:15.837 --> 01:00:17.257]  He criticizes them for corruption.
[01:00:18.678 --> 01:00:21.340]  The mayor says, that violates parliamentary procedure.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:22.460]  They kick him out.
[01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:27.923]  And the cop, as he's going out the door, he's not resisting, not even touching him, punches him right in the back.
[01:00:29.019 --> 01:00:33.561]  And then they get on him and the cop's beating him, people are standing around going, yeah, get him, get him, get him!
[01:00:34.162 --> 01:00:38.864]  And then the news says, well, the council member got in a fight, so the officer had to take him down.
[01:00:39.565 --> 01:00:39.905]  What?
[01:00:40.505 --> 01:00:41.766]  The cop assaulted him!
[01:00:42.106 --> 01:00:47.309]  So see now, when the cop assaults you, that's the fight, and then they arrest you because they assaulted you.
[01:00:47.909 --> 01:00:49.290]  Why, you just committed a crime!
[01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:51.351]  You're in a fight here after I punched you!
[01:00:51.831 --> 01:00:55.053]  I mean, it's so incredible!
[01:00:57.316 --> 01:00:58.397]  Wait till you see the video.
[01:00:58.458 --> 01:00:59.519]  I'm going to get it up there for you.
[01:01:01.101 --> 01:01:02.422]  On InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[01:01:02.442 --> 01:01:03.303]  We're going to play the audio.
[01:01:03.624 --> 01:01:04.805]  The incredible spin.
[01:01:04.845 --> 01:01:07.509]  But see, if you heard the audio, you would believe it.
[01:01:07.529 --> 01:01:09.671]  Oh, the city councilman got in a fight, so the cops took him down.
[01:01:11.273 --> 01:01:14.317]  But if you watch the video, the cop punches him in the back.
[01:01:16.428 --> 01:01:31.744]  Then knocks him down out in the front down the steps and gets on his back and is punching him full force to the head while sick city employees go, yeah, yeah, yeah, game, oh, yeah.
[01:01:31.764 --> 01:01:33.686]  I mean that's how they sound.
[01:01:33.726 --> 01:01:34.607]  That's their spirit.
[01:01:34.867 --> 01:01:36.589]  They're just mindless twits.
[01:01:37.429 --> 01:01:48.936]  They know nothing, they're ignorant, they love all the poison the government puts in their food, they love being fools, and they just love watching people get pilloried, or in the stocks, or basically in the arena.
[01:01:50.437 --> 01:01:51.337]  But see, that's what's happening.
[01:01:51.918 --> 01:01:56.440]  Pretty soon, regional boards, it's already happening, are just going to run the city councils.
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:01.123]  And if councilmen don't do a good job, they'll walk them right out on the street and just fire guns into them.
[01:02:01.583 --> 01:02:03.104]  I mean, that's basically where this leads.
[01:02:03.124 --> 01:02:04.345]  That's what third world countries do.
[01:02:06.474 --> 01:02:10.957]  With El Jefe pot-bellied ruler cops running all the whores, the drugs, everything.
[01:02:11.197 --> 01:02:12.278]  Just ruling over us.
[01:02:12.298 --> 01:02:18.583]  So what we're going to do is for about 20 minutes after the break, I'm going to take 5-10 calls on this subject.
[01:02:18.703 --> 01:02:20.864]  This subject.
[01:02:20.884 --> 01:02:21.204]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:02:21.645 --> 01:02:24.327]  How they're tasering everybody.
[01:02:24.367 --> 01:02:26.768]  How they're hiring agent provocateurs to cause riots.
[01:02:27.229 --> 01:02:29.130]  How they're attacking people for their free speech.
[01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:32.232]  How this country... See, notice they told you everything changed after 9-11.
[01:02:32.372 --> 01:02:34.794]  Yeah, they got rid of the borders and then made us slaves.
[01:02:36.042 --> 01:02:37.343]  And suddenly started tasering us.
[01:02:37.403 --> 01:02:38.544]  And suddenly started being abusive.
[01:02:38.584 --> 01:02:41.166]  And suddenly started... We have video today of Aaron Dykes.
[01:02:41.186 --> 01:02:41.847]  We talked about it yesterday.
[01:02:41.867 --> 01:02:42.488]  The video's up.
[01:02:43.128 --> 01:02:43.989]  Cop after cop.
[01:02:44.049 --> 01:02:44.489]  Hitting him.
[01:02:44.529 --> 01:02:45.250]  Bumping into him.
[01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:46.051]  Hitting the camera.
[01:02:46.711 --> 01:02:47.732]  And then cop's going, Oh!
[01:02:47.972 --> 01:02:50.394]  Why are you assaulting the officer?
[01:02:50.855 --> 01:02:55.258]  We have to arrest... And see, that's the thing now.
[01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:57.060]  On camera.
[01:02:58.401 --> 01:02:59.742]  They assault you.
[01:02:59.762 --> 01:03:00.743]  And then go, Oh!
[01:03:00.783 --> 01:03:02.585]  He was assaulting to me!
[01:03:02.605 --> 01:03:03.085]  He did?
[01:03:08.343 --> 01:03:09.984]  That's the way this operates now.
[01:03:13.287 --> 01:03:15.349]  And they just put lines out and go, what are you gonna do about it?
[01:03:15.369 --> 01:03:34.124]  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[01:03:35.046 --> 01:03:37.127]  I want you to get mad and get fired up!
[01:03:37.748 --> 01:03:40.409]  Big economic news coming up as well!
[01:03:43.951 --> 01:03:44.991]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:03:45.312 --> 01:03:48.093]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:03:48.373 --> 01:03:52.536]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:03:52.956 --> 01:03:53.776]  So what do you do?
[01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:58.679]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:03:59.159 --> 01:04:01.280]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:04:01.761 --> 01:04:16.470]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:23.574]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:04:23.914 --> 01:04:28.318]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[01:04:30.561 --> 01:04:30.781]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:04:45.154 --> 01:04:50.638]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:51.038 --> 01:04:58.643]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:59.355 --> 01:05:06.418]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:06.818 --> 01:05:18.243]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:18.543 --> 01:05:22.245]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:22.525 --> 01:05:24.486]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:24.786 --> 01:05:28.628]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:42.034 --> 01:05:44.995]  Where do you think one of the most toxic places on earth is?
[01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:46.515]  The answer may surprise you.
[01:05:46.695 --> 01:05:47.675]  It's in your body.
[01:05:47.935 --> 01:05:51.776]  The colon is a natural breeding ground for disease-producing germs.
[01:05:52.036 --> 01:05:56.158]  It may not sound like a very appealing subject, but it should not go ignored.
[01:05:56.318 --> 01:06:03.519]  For over a decade now, natural health expert Dr. Lauren Ritter has educated people everywhere about the benefits of internal cleansing.
[01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:06.000]  Now these benefits include higher energy levels,
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:10.541]  More comfortable digestion, high immune support, and healthier looking skin.
[01:06:10.861 --> 01:06:15.462]  Now you can try Dr. Ritter's Colon Cleansing Program from the privacy of your own home.
[01:06:15.842 --> 01:06:20.163]  It's safe and natural, and it gently cleanses the entire digestive tract.
[01:06:20.324 --> 01:06:23.004]  Don't let your body be the most toxic place on earth.
[01:06:23.324 --> 01:06:26.185]  Take care of your health by cleansing your colon and body.
[01:06:27.185 --> 01:06:29.226]  Dial 1-800-890-2014.
[01:06:29.386 --> 01:06:31.247]  That's 1-800-890-2014.
[01:06:32.367 --> 01:06:37.409]  Call now to find out how you can get the colon and body cleanse risk-free for 30 days.
[01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:40.471]  Dial 1-800-890-2014.
[01:06:40.691 --> 01:06:41.191]  Call now.
[01:06:43.592 --> 01:06:49.614]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:50.235 --> 01:06:53.196]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.013 --> 01:07:15.921]  At a primitive core level, when you watch your cameraman being beat up by cops and being shoved from one cop to the other as they laugh, it's like out of a movie.
[01:07:16.462 --> 01:07:22.746]  You know, I used to always think like archetypal Italian gangsters were
[01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:30.383]  Overdone in movies like Goodfellas and The Godfather, but now I've met some, it's actually underdone.
[01:07:30.404 --> 01:07:34.965]  And I used to think that, like, Boss Hog was overdone for the South.
[01:07:35.065 --> 01:07:35.446]  No, no, no.
[01:07:35.686 --> 01:07:37.927]  Then later in life, I met real Boss Hogs.
[01:07:38.307 --> 01:07:48.351]  I went and covered stories where they were, you know, randomly arresting black people and putting them in prison and planting drugs on them, and there's the sheriff, and it literally is Boss Hog in a white Cadillac.
[01:07:51.032 --> 01:07:51.512]  Convertible.
[01:07:52.156 --> 01:07:53.097]  I mean, literally.
[01:07:54.838 --> 01:07:59.222]  People that have made all these movies and these archetypes and these films, it is art imitating life.
[01:07:59.302 --> 01:08:01.745]  It's not life imitating art.
[01:08:03.686 --> 01:08:07.710]  And when you see cops that are literally like caricatures out of a movie,
[01:08:08.824 --> 01:08:10.785]  Weak, soft, effeminate.
[01:08:10.805 --> 01:08:12.866]  It's not even fair to women to say effeminate.
[01:08:12.886 --> 01:08:15.167]  Just real, and just real gangstering.
[01:08:15.207 --> 01:08:16.487]  Like, hey, how you doing?
[01:08:16.507 --> 01:08:17.407]  I love you!
[01:08:17.467 --> 01:08:22.629]  And slap him on the arm, and hit him with their elbow, and hit him in the camera, and shoving him from one cop to the other.
[01:08:22.989 --> 01:08:23.210]  Oh!
[01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:27.611]  It's just like in a movie when thugs surround some innocent person, and they shove you from person to person.
[01:08:28.091 --> 01:08:29.312]  Oh, where you going?
[01:08:29.452 --> 01:08:30.692]  Oh, why you assaulting me?
[01:08:31.053 --> 01:08:31.253]  Oh!
[01:08:31.653 --> 01:08:33.113]  Oh, he hit you, did he?
[01:08:33.133 --> 01:08:34.714]  Oh, he did it, huh?
[01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:38.399]  It's like a movie!
[01:08:39.039 --> 01:08:41.320]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:43.120]  The easiest place to find it is Jones Report.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.240]  It's like the second story there.
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.801]  I hope people will get it and get it out to everybody.
[01:08:46.401 --> 01:08:47.601]  And they're just beating Aaron up.
[01:08:50.502 --> 01:08:52.702]  Broke the metal mount on the top of the camera.
[01:08:52.722 --> 01:08:57.603]  I mean, ripped metal fittings out of aluminum.
[01:08:59.924 --> 01:09:00.844]  But that's not enough.
[01:09:01.224 --> 01:09:02.364]  They aren't just thugs.
[01:09:02.864 --> 01:09:05.105]  Didn't they have to claim he was assaulting them?
[01:09:05.345 --> 01:09:06.645]  It's not enough, you see.
[01:09:07.811 --> 01:09:12.815]  Just like in Indiana with the city councilman, they say, get out of here!
[01:09:13.116 --> 01:09:15.858]  We're not going to have people criticizing the police department!
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.341]  And the cop's like, wolves!
[01:09:19.401 --> 01:09:19.961]  Get behind him!
[01:09:19.981 --> 01:09:21.142]  He's walking out, he's like, okay.
[01:09:21.883 --> 01:09:23.965]  He's like seven years old, we're trying to get a hold of him right now.
[01:09:24.305 --> 01:09:27.287]  He turns his back and the police chief goes, pow!
[01:09:27.367 --> 01:09:28.068]  Right in the back.
[01:09:28.508 --> 01:09:28.949]  Bam!
[01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:36.548]  And he buckles over, falls down the stairs, and he just sits right on him and just starts going BAM!
[01:09:36.668 --> 01:09:37.208]  BAM!
[01:09:37.328 --> 01:09:37.828]  BAM!
[01:09:37.948 --> 01:09:38.388]  BAM!
[01:09:38.768 --> 01:09:40.089]  But that's not the news either.
[01:09:41.169 --> 01:09:46.051]  What's news is that the news said there was a fight and the cops responded.
[01:09:46.612 --> 01:09:48.112]  What incredible spin!
[01:09:48.172 --> 01:09:49.373]  What a way to put that!
[01:09:50.333 --> 01:09:51.513]  That is so Orwellian!
[01:09:52.394 --> 01:09:55.255]  Because they couldn't possibly have the gods doing wrong!
[01:09:57.938 --> 01:10:02.542]  When the gods are caught child molesting, or running whores, or drug dealing, it's always quiet in the news.
[01:10:02.582 --> 01:10:03.483]  Not a big issue.
[01:10:03.523 --> 01:10:05.485]  Let's just keep that quiet.
[01:10:05.545 --> 01:10:06.065]  Move on.
[01:10:06.085 --> 01:10:09.168]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[01:10:09.188 --> 01:10:13.411]  They beat the city councilman up in front of all these cameras, in front of all these people.
[01:10:16.574 --> 01:10:21.678]  The councilman got in a fight, and the officers responded and took him down.
[01:10:23.039 --> 01:10:24.581]  See how evil that is?
[01:10:25.541 --> 01:10:34.028]  Not only is the cop going to get away with punching him in the back, getting on top of him, they're going to send the councilman to jail for it!
[01:10:34.328 --> 01:10:35.249]  With video!
[01:10:35.349 --> 01:10:36.870]  It doesn't matter anymore!
[01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:42.855]  And I'm not even saying cops are our enemies.
[01:10:42.875 --> 01:10:47.098]  They are a manifestation of a wicked, decadent, evil, brainwashed country.
[01:10:47.639 --> 01:10:49.400]  A country of lawless idiots.
[01:10:50.781 --> 01:10:52.402]  I mean, it's national numbers, over 80% of
[01:10:53.792 --> 01:10:56.853]  High school graduates do not know who the Vice President is.
[01:10:57.953 --> 01:11:00.254]  Over one-fifth can't find the U.S.
[01:11:00.314 --> 01:11:04.095]  on a map.
[01:11:05.575 --> 01:11:08.196]  Most people can't name more than five state capitals.
[01:11:10.817 --> 01:11:13.318]  Most Americans cannot name what year 9-11 happened.
[01:11:14.807 --> 01:11:16.828]  Most Americans cannot name anything.
[01:11:17.249 --> 01:11:18.649]  They don't know the three branches of government.
[01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:20.190]  They don't know what the Fourth Amendment is.
[01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:21.191]  They don't know nothing.
[01:11:21.351 --> 01:11:22.552]  And those cops don't either.
[01:11:22.892 --> 01:11:26.354]  They just go home and watch Jack Bauer at night and think, that's what a tough guy does.
[01:11:27.135 --> 01:11:31.157]  And you talk back to them, they'll crack your head right open, right there, and charge you.
[01:11:31.177 --> 01:11:38.842]  Alright, I said I'd go to calls.
[01:11:39.082 --> 01:11:40.343]  I'm just, I'm totally freaked out now.
[01:11:41.716 --> 01:11:59.725]  Because when they start beating up city councilmen and then saying he was bad, that's like if a bank teller got robbed and shot by a gunman, that would be like saying that the bank teller assaulted the lead bullet.
[01:12:01.226 --> 01:12:08.230]  That would be like having the female bank teller on the news as the bank robber, and then the bank robber is dressed up in a cop's uniform.
[01:12:11.778 --> 01:12:15.739]  I mean, it's all so over the top now, there's not even any way to deal with it.
[01:12:17.779 --> 01:12:26.061]  Just like when they go on the news and say, mercury is good for you, lead is good for children, poison is good in the food.
[01:12:26.101 --> 01:12:27.362]  I mean, they say it!
[01:12:27.822 --> 01:12:29.762]  You cannot make this type stuff up!
[01:12:29.882 --> 01:12:32.903]  It is so that the society is insane!
[01:12:33.023 --> 01:12:33.823]  They're insane!
[01:12:34.103 --> 01:12:38.124]  People that buy all this bull and all this baloney and think everything's okay, they're nuts!
[01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:41.835]  I'm getting into the economy coming up, but right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:12:43.116 --> 01:12:46.216]  Robert in California, then Tom, Byron, Steve, Steve, and others.
[01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:48.677]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Robert.
[01:12:49.137 --> 01:12:49.737]  How you doing, sir?
[01:12:50.517 --> 01:12:51.697]  I just can't believe it anymore.
[01:12:52.498 --> 01:12:53.158]  I understand.
[01:12:53.678 --> 01:12:59.519]  For many years, you know, I tried to tell people about the things that are going on, and that it was only going to get worse.
[01:12:59.599 --> 01:13:02.200]  In fact, the week before 9-11, I was talking to a friend.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:09.101]  I said, you know, there is going to be some sort of attack in this country where they're going to use that attack for their benefit.
[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:13.441]  And then lo and behold, I woke up the next week and there it was.
[01:13:13.601 --> 01:13:16.462]  But let's get back to the subject you want to talk about.
[01:13:16.822 --> 01:13:18.763]  I'm going to revisit the UCLA incident.
[01:13:19.363 --> 01:13:31.347]  Actually, if you watch, even though the video is poor, and I worked in security and with law enforcement from time to time, you can actually see that before they taser that guy, he's already in restraints and handcuffs as they're dragging him down the stairs.
[01:13:32.928 --> 01:13:36.469]  And it's just getting insane.
[01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:44.391]  It's just, you know, people like you and I who see these things and are appalled by it and sickened by it.
[01:13:45.432 --> 01:13:51.857]  And then there's just the people that are, you know, they take a look at it and say, well, that's okay.
[01:13:52.317 --> 01:13:53.598]  Well, it's a formality.
[01:13:53.618 --> 01:14:00.523]  I mean, soon they might pull out like a samurai sword and like gut him and his guts spill out and they go, he resisted.
[01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:02.104]  I mean, it's getting to that point.
[01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:04.931]  Yeah, and that's the thing.
[01:14:04.951 --> 01:14:15.658]  They use a point of law where at one time they were sworn to protect and serve the populace, or the people, and now they're serving their emperor, their praetorians.
[01:14:16.019 --> 01:14:17.900]  They've turned into the worst of the worst.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.464]  Well, now they're so aggressive, it got to where Roman emperors were always being overthrown by their generals.
[01:14:25.525 --> 01:14:27.646]  And then you have a new emperor every month sometimes.
[01:14:28.327 --> 01:14:30.488]  Kerry didn't even want this.
[01:14:30.508 --> 01:14:31.769]  They were just trying to show off.
[01:14:32.762 --> 01:14:49.074]  Right, and the thing is I know, I hear you speak sometimes that we're trying to prevent this from happening or sort of maybe to slow down the process so there's many more of us that have the numbers and the knowledge and the information and we're not being
[01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:51.631]  Uh, put to sleep anymore.
[01:14:51.691 --> 01:14:54.933]  In other words, our ignorance is being stripped away little by little.
[01:14:55.693 --> 01:15:00.495]  Um, but this, this end game, this end time, this, this, this will happen.
[01:15:00.555 --> 01:15:11.501]  I mean, I've wasn't administered for many years where we have many people going behind the Iron Curtain and coming back out and throughout the whole world saying, this is what's going on.
[01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:13.242]  You know, this is what's going to happen.
[01:15:13.262 --> 01:15:16.384]  And I'm seeing it just sort of unfold before my eyes.
[01:15:17.225 --> 01:15:22.667]  And I am just, like you, shocked, sickened.
[01:15:23.647 --> 01:15:24.408]  It's just crazy.
[01:15:24.928 --> 01:15:26.088]  I don't want more to tell you.
[01:15:26.108 --> 01:15:29.309]  It's just, these people are sowing their seeds of their own destruction.
[01:15:30.009 --> 01:15:30.590]  And they don't know it.
[01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:36.212]  They're blinded by whatever greed or avarice or arrogance and power.
[01:15:36.252 --> 01:15:37.232]  I mean, it's not money.
[01:15:37.272 --> 01:15:43.934]  Look, they've told New York cops, and I appreciate your call and your fine points, it's been in the news that the cops have been told to be mean.
[01:15:44.935 --> 01:15:46.055]  They've been told, be rude to people.
[01:15:47.825 --> 01:15:49.406]  They want us to get that message.
[01:15:50.667 --> 01:15:51.628]  And so they're more than happy.
[01:15:51.648 --> 01:15:52.388]  They're like, alright.
[01:15:52.528 --> 01:15:54.930]  They hire these little thug types, real soft.
[01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:57.291]  Most of these cops have never been in a real fight.
[01:15:57.351 --> 01:15:58.852]  Most of them never grew up anywhere rough.
[01:15:59.493 --> 01:16:01.394]  Most of them, you can see them, they're real effeminate.
[01:16:01.434 --> 01:16:02.635]  They're kind of waddling around.
[01:16:02.655 --> 01:16:05.777]  Or they're roid heads who've got something to prove.
[01:16:05.797 --> 01:16:09.519]  And you know, they don't even have male organs anymore.
[01:16:09.539 --> 01:16:10.420]  They're all shriveled up.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.242]  But still, they've got all this testosterone they've injected.
[01:16:14.062 --> 01:16:16.424]  And they just like running around attacking people.
[01:16:17.148 --> 01:16:18.709]  A real man defends the weak.
[01:16:18.789 --> 01:16:20.329]  A real man stands up against bullies.
[01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:26.952]  You don't strut around and, you know, gang up ten of you on some college kid and beat the daylights out of him and taser him.
[01:16:30.114 --> 01:16:31.414]  But hey, you want tyranny?
[01:16:31.434 --> 01:16:32.075]  You're gonna get it.
[01:16:32.555 --> 01:16:40.098]  Just know this, the black cup you filled up full of pus, you're the one that poured it, you're the one making us drink it, and let me just tell you how things work, you gotta drink it too.
[01:16:40.959 --> 01:16:42.880]  You wanted a big dish of Karzu Marzu?
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:43.760]  You're getting it, brother.
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:44.700]  Okay?
[01:16:45.241 --> 01:16:45.721]  Just remember,
[01:16:46.744 --> 01:16:47.765]  Want to know who to blame?
[01:16:47.805 --> 01:16:48.686]  Just look in the mirror.
[01:16:48.826 --> 01:16:51.148]  That's all I want you to remember down the road.
[01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:54.810]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in California.
[01:16:54.831 --> 01:16:55.411]  Tom, go ahead.
[01:16:55.431 --> 01:17:00.555]  Hey, I just want to let you know that it's happening here too.
[01:17:03.878 --> 01:17:05.499]  Cops just beat some guy to death.
[01:17:05.799 --> 01:17:07.701]  Homeless guy at a food shelter.
[01:17:07.721 --> 01:17:10.263]  They're handing out food and he started flipping out.
[01:17:11.778 --> 01:17:12.999]  Cops came and beat him to death.
[01:17:13.359 --> 01:17:13.919]  Beat him in the head.
[01:17:13.939 --> 01:17:15.460]  He died in jail.
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.121]  Well, they don't have mental hospitals really anymore.
[01:17:18.161 --> 01:17:19.742]  The state ones, they let them go.
[01:17:19.822 --> 01:17:23.044]  So the state hospital in Austin used to be in North Austin.
[01:17:23.084 --> 01:17:25.405]  Now it's on South Lamar in Congress.
[01:17:25.425 --> 01:17:26.286]  And that's where they are.
[01:17:26.326 --> 01:17:30.628]  They're the same schizophrenics completely out of their minds every day out there.
[01:17:31.449 --> 01:17:33.029]  And it's the same all over the country.
[01:17:33.089 --> 01:17:35.711]  And yeah, it's like this other schizophrenic woman paralyzed.
[01:17:36.911 --> 01:17:38.452]  They told her to get up out of her chair.
[01:17:38.492 --> 01:17:39.633]  She couldn't, so they just killed her.
[01:17:42.082 --> 01:17:42.682]  That's how it works.
[01:17:42.702 --> 01:17:43.943]  You don't follow orders, you die.
[01:17:44.683 --> 01:17:46.404]  And it's happening where I live also.
[01:17:46.784 --> 01:17:48.145]  Only let you and your listeners know.
[01:17:49.145 --> 01:17:49.906]  What'd they do to him?
[01:17:50.886 --> 01:17:51.606]  They beat him to death.
[01:17:51.926 --> 01:17:52.607]  They beat him up.
[01:17:53.147 --> 01:17:56.068]  I don't know, six or seven cops out on the street in front of everybody.
[01:17:56.088 --> 01:17:56.909]  There were witnesses.
[01:17:56.969 --> 01:17:58.329]  Witnesses are afraid to speak out.
[01:17:58.489 --> 01:17:59.530]  But that feels good.
[01:17:59.570 --> 01:18:05.533]  I mean, at a certain animal level, to really kill somebody, to feel those blows and to feel those bones and that skull cracking.
[01:18:05.553 --> 01:18:07.313]  That guy was getting a rush off that.
[01:18:07.333 --> 01:18:08.414]  What's wrong with him getting a rush?
[01:18:08.814 --> 01:18:09.294]  Amazing.
[01:18:09.494 --> 01:18:10.055]  Unbelievable.
[01:18:10.335 --> 01:18:10.955]  It's unbelievable.
[01:18:12.228 --> 01:18:12.688]  Unbelievable.
[01:18:13.729 --> 01:18:16.131]  And they don't even have, uh, we don't have tasers here yet.
[01:18:16.611 --> 01:18:18.412]  They'll just either beat you to death or shoot you.
[01:18:18.432 --> 01:18:22.675]  And it's the fourth time in a year and a half in a place where this kind of thing never happened.
[01:18:22.695 --> 01:18:28.558]  I think there was one cop shooting death in 10 years here, you know, some bizarre incident.
[01:18:28.999 --> 01:18:31.440]  It's the fourth time in a year and a half now.
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.582]  Oh yeah, all of a sudden, we're all dying.
[01:18:33.602 --> 01:18:35.063]  We're all getting tasered and killed.
[01:18:35.663 --> 01:18:36.844]  Cause it's a new America.
[01:18:36.884 --> 01:18:38.565]  We're fighting the terrorists now.
[01:18:44.446 --> 01:18:48.949]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:18:49.289 --> 01:18:53.392]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:18:53.672 --> 01:18:54.233]  We listened.
[01:18:54.533 --> 01:18:59.516]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:18:59.776 --> 01:19:00.277]  We listened.
[01:19:00.657 --> 01:19:03.699]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:04.119 --> 01:19:04.660]  We listened.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:08.262]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping, entering,
[01:19:08.502 --> 01:19:09.062]  We're good to go.
[01:19:25.533 --> 01:19:28.176]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.

[01:19:47.997 --> 01:19:48.397]  That's $741.03, $365.45, and $182.73.
[01:19:56.371 --> 01:20:02.353]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[01:20:02.414 --> 01:20:06.735]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a yon revolution.
[01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:15.499]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[01:20:15.539 --> 01:20:18.120]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:22.282]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[01:20:22.483 --> 01:20:28.886]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[01:20:29.227 --> 01:20:32.729]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:20:32.789 --> 01:20:35.951]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in the global game of chess.
[01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:36.311]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:36.511]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:47.427]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:20:47.847 --> 01:20:52.073]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:20:52.513 --> 01:20:59.362]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:20:59.802 --> 01:21:06.504]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:21:06.824 --> 01:21:08.425]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:21:08.745 --> 01:21:11.926]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:21:12.186 --> 01:21:13.387]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:21:13.647 --> 01:21:14.647]  Eliminate the cause.

[01:21:29.012 --> 01:21:30.673]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:21:41.667 --> 01:21:43.628]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:21:43.888 --> 01:21:46.949]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:51.991]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:21:52.291 --> 01:21:55.032]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:21:55.292 --> 01:21:59.954]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[01:22:00.234 --> 01:22:02.135]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:22:02.615 --> 01:22:12.564]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology, and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[01:22:12.944 --> 01:22:17.648]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:22:18.009 --> 01:22:21.532]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:22:21.772 --> 01:22:23.914]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[01:22:24.234 --> 01:22:26.376]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[01:22:26.556 --> 01:22:31.762]  We'll even refund the shipping charge, share the oil company's secret, and get SFR now!
[01:22:31.982 --> 01:22:32.883]  What are you waiting for?
[01:22:33.063 --> 01:22:33.744]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[01:22:33.944 --> 01:22:34.165]  That's 1-888-873-7371.
[01:22:34.205 --> 01:22:34.365]  Today!
[01:22:34.405 --> 01:22:35.987]  We don't need no education.
[01:22:56.206 --> 01:22:58.527]  After we take some more calls, I'm going to get into the economy.
[01:22:59.348 --> 01:23:00.788]  Big developments since yesterday.
[01:23:00.848 --> 01:23:01.809]  We'll be breaking it down.
[01:23:03.009 --> 01:23:06.391]  Right now, let's go to Steve in Colorado.
[01:23:06.411 --> 01:23:07.251]  Steve, thanks for holding.
[01:23:07.371 --> 01:23:07.692]  Welcome.
[01:23:08.772 --> 01:23:09.693]  Yeah, hey there, Alex.
[01:23:10.153 --> 01:23:11.253]  A couple of questions.
[01:23:11.613 --> 01:23:19.137]  First of all, did you hear something relating to Andrew Meyer about him reading, he mentioned a specific book
[01:23:20.126 --> 01:23:23.687]  Yeah, he had a Greg Palast armed manhouse bug.
[01:23:24.407 --> 01:23:24.947]  Ah, okay.
[01:23:25.307 --> 01:23:43.412]  Alright, and then my second question is, do you remember who was the guy in the wheelchair up in, I think it was like Michigan or something, that was calling the city council to account, and they charged him with some crime for actually having the audacity to
[01:23:43.857 --> 01:23:47.499]  To expect accountability for the city council?
[01:23:47.679 --> 01:23:51.241]  No, they sent him to prison with his wife for five years.
[01:23:51.822 --> 01:23:54.343]  That was in Madison, Wisconsin.
[01:23:54.724 --> 01:23:56.184]  And they called him a paper terrorist.
[01:23:56.224 --> 01:23:57.986]  And he sued the city council.
[01:23:58.526 --> 01:23:59.867]  And they said, you're not allowed to do that.
[01:23:59.907 --> 01:24:00.967]  And they sent him to jail.
[01:24:01.127 --> 01:24:02.368]  And they were taking his property, too.
[01:24:02.808 --> 01:24:04.189]  And so they just sent him to prison, yeah.
[01:24:04.549 --> 01:24:06.170]  Okay, that was in Madison, Wisconsin.
[01:24:06.231 --> 01:24:06.491]  Okay.
[01:24:06.931 --> 01:24:08.572]  Alright, well, Godspeed to you, Alex.
[01:24:08.632 --> 01:24:09.452]  Thanks for all you do.
[01:24:09.633 --> 01:24:09.993]  Thank you.
[01:24:10.053 --> 01:24:11.053]  I appreciate your call.
[01:24:11.093 --> 01:24:13.435]  No, no, I mean, a great age of darkness is now upon us.
[01:24:15.319 --> 01:24:18.020]  They didn't go from 300,000 cops to a million and a half.
[01:24:18.581 --> 01:24:20.501]  They're trying to double that right now for nothing.
[01:24:20.541 --> 01:24:24.163]  They did that to let you know that they are in command.
[01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:26.104]  And they run the show.
[01:24:26.924 --> 01:24:28.105]  The borders are coming down.
[01:24:28.365 --> 01:24:29.445]  The country's going down.
[01:24:29.726 --> 01:24:30.686]  The dollar's going down.
[01:24:30.726 --> 01:24:32.887]  And if you get up, buddy, they're going to blow your head off.
[01:24:35.788 --> 01:24:36.409]  It's real simple.
[01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:38.569]  They're announcing.
[01:24:38.610 --> 01:24:41.151]  The head of the Air Force said, what, eight months ago?
[01:24:41.551 --> 01:24:43.892]  He said, we're going to use microwave guns.
[01:24:45.356 --> 01:24:51.057]  All the American people, they're illegal under the Geneva Convention, but he said if we use them on the American people first, we can then use them in Baghdad.
[01:24:51.097 --> 01:24:52.817]  They burn your skin, they've now deployed them.
[01:24:55.718 --> 01:24:57.738]  They're just getting you ready right now for the fun.
[01:24:59.539 --> 01:25:03.259]  Now, if we're able to recognize what we're facing and what we're dealing with, they may back off.
[01:25:03.639 --> 01:25:05.460]  And cops may decide they don't want to go along with us.
[01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:12.701]  I know the police decided five years ago they didn't want to take the mandatory smallpox shot that was killing everybody that took it.
[01:25:14.255 --> 01:25:16.917]  Figure of speech, it killed a large percentage of those that took it.
[01:25:18.258 --> 01:25:19.298]  And something funny happened.
[01:25:20.119 --> 01:25:32.727]  They ordered 14 million first responders, nurses, firemen, police, doctors, janitors at hospitals, everybody, to take it and 99 plus percent said no, according to the LA Times.
[01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:34.728]  So you know something, don't you?
[01:25:34.769 --> 01:25:35.729]  You know something.
[01:25:36.049 --> 01:25:37.670]  You're not as stupid as you act.
[01:25:38.951 --> 01:25:41.213]  Why don't you take that nectar from your government?
[01:25:41.673 --> 01:25:42.754]  That sweet nectar.
[01:25:43.399 --> 01:25:45.100]  The government's good after all.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.680]  Take the love shot they got for you, cop.
[01:25:49.521 --> 01:25:50.721]  The government's so good.
[01:25:50.741 --> 01:25:54.442]  Wait till you find out what happened to your dollar.
[01:25:56.003 --> 01:25:59.464]  The same masters that turned you loose on us are the ones doing that to you, copper.
[01:26:01.284 --> 01:26:03.045]  See, I don't even dislike you.
[01:26:03.145 --> 01:26:04.505]  I'm disgusted with you.
[01:26:04.745 --> 01:26:09.867]  Just like I'm disgusted with all these yuppies and all these liberals and all these phony conservative scum everywhere.
[01:26:09.907 --> 01:26:11.207]  You're not real Americans.
[01:26:12.952 --> 01:26:15.853]  We gotta admit how pathetic we are before we get this country back.
[01:26:19.235 --> 01:26:21.556]  Mainstream news today about how the elite want to kill us.
[01:26:21.616 --> 01:26:22.577]  It's finally getting in the news.
[01:26:22.617 --> 01:26:23.557]  I'll cover that later too.
[01:26:23.917 --> 01:26:24.378]  Third hour.
[01:26:27.119 --> 01:26:28.640]  Brian in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:30.000]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:26:30.461 --> 01:26:31.881]  Hey, I just...something real quick.
[01:26:31.901 --> 01:26:35.363]  You were talking about tasering that Myers kid from Florida there.
[01:26:36.142 --> 01:26:39.483]  Uh, have you ever seen a article that's on YouTube?
[01:26:39.683 --> 01:26:45.364]  It's on a FAUD, F-A-U-O-D, K-A-A-D-Y.
[01:26:45.424 --> 01:26:46.284]  Well, just tell me about it.
[01:26:46.784 --> 01:26:51.685]  Well, what happened, he was in a car accident, and his car caught on fire.
[01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:53.826]  I think he was around 19, 20, 21 years old.
[01:26:54.786 --> 01:27:01.948]  And he's sitting there on the side of the road, he has no clothes, his skin is, like I said, literally hanging from his body.
[01:27:02.208 --> 01:27:03.048]  The cops show up,
[01:27:03.891 --> 01:27:06.053]  Yeah, I've seen the cases where people are hurt.
[01:27:26.589 --> 01:27:30.110]  Or they'll taser 94-year-old blind women because they don't respond.
[01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:31.630]  I mean, the cops are so dumb.
[01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:34.531]  In that one case in Oregon, they go in the house in the trailer.
[01:27:35.071 --> 01:27:36.451]  They're evicting stuff out of the front.
[01:27:36.491 --> 01:27:38.172]  Her daughter, 70-something, complains.
[01:27:38.212 --> 01:27:38.992]  They taser her.
[01:27:39.272 --> 01:27:41.513]  They go in to rifle the house to find something illegal.
[01:27:41.733 --> 01:27:48.514]  There's a 94-year-old blind deaf woman sitting there, so they go ahead and... Was that the Oregon one or was that the Washington one?
[01:27:48.534 --> 01:27:49.334]  There's two different ones.
[01:27:49.854 --> 01:27:52.015]  I mean, you can't even make this stuff up, man.
[01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:52.948]  Yeah.
[01:27:53.249 --> 01:28:00.159]  Well, anyhow, they sit there, and then when he starts moving and they, according to them, get aggressive, they take the guns and empty out their two pistols into him.
[01:28:00.931 --> 01:28:03.912]  And then they say, well, he was acting like he was on drugs in the autopsy shows.
[01:28:03.952 --> 01:28:05.493]  He had no drugs in him whatsoever.
[01:28:05.533 --> 01:28:09.495]  But it's on the YouTube, uh, uh, uh, FODKD.
[01:28:09.675 --> 01:28:15.397]  You ought to take a look at it, because I mean... Tell you what, email it, email it to, uh, Mike at InfoWars.com.
[01:28:15.737 --> 01:28:19.339]  I'll make sure Paul Watson, our go-to man, gets that up.
[01:28:19.359 --> 01:28:20.919]  We're going to create a whole section of these.
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:23.440]  And it's, it's like the gladiatorial section.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:26.381]  We'll have police execute handcuffed man section.
[01:28:26.582 --> 01:28:27.662]  We'll have hundreds of clips there.
[01:28:27.682 --> 01:28:29.703]  Then we'll have them tasering all women section.
[01:28:32.489 --> 01:28:35.497]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:39.107]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:43.004 --> 01:28:44.845]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:28:44.985 --> 01:28:50.166]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:28:50.346 --> 01:28:51.687]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:28:51.947 --> 01:29:00.129]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:29:00.329 --> 01:29:05.671]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:29:05.691 --> 01:29:06.391]  I think so.
[01:29:25.998 --> 01:29:26.398]  I think so.
[01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:47.296]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:29:47.616 --> 01:29:49.498]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[01:29:49.698 --> 01:29:52.742]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:29:52.922 --> 01:29:56.066]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:29:56.366 --> 01:29:58.208]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:29:58.468 --> 01:29:58.828]  We're good to go.
[01:30:14.921 --> 01:30:19.264]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.

[01:31:55.595 --> 01:31:57.856]  You're being conditioned.
[01:31:57.916 --> 01:32:00.777]  We're all being conditioned.
[01:32:00.817 --> 01:32:04.359]  To accept lying by the government.
[01:32:21.115 --> 01:32:25.159]  To accept people tied down in handcuffs being tasered.
[01:32:25.959 --> 01:32:28.462]  Quote, if you don't comply with the order, you're tortured.
[01:32:30.223 --> 01:32:31.805]  And it's gonna get worse and worse.
[01:32:35.658 --> 01:32:38.361]  And they've got all their brainwashing for the cops.
[01:32:39.682 --> 01:32:46.508]  It's the same thing they do to the general public.
[01:32:47.289 --> 01:32:50.111]  Go ahead, believe the system.
[01:32:50.412 --> 01:32:52.854]  They're not lying to us, they're good.

[01:33:28.489 --> 01:33:28.949]  Okay.

[01:33:40.215 --> 01:33:44.278]  The mainstream media is admitting that the big banks stand to gain from all the stuff they're doing.
[01:33:44.878 --> 01:33:49.722]  So I'm going to go through how they cut interest rates, how it jacked up the stock market, but what that really means.
[01:33:52.504 --> 01:33:54.505]  We'll be breaking it down coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:33:54.845 --> 01:33:57.667]  First off, don't forget about a great sponsor.
[01:33:57.707 --> 01:34:00.109]  We've got blacklistedherb.com.

[01:34:11.778 --> 01:34:12.779]  877-327-0365.
[01:34:13.319 --> 01:34:15.720]  It's Shilocene.
[01:34:16.081 --> 01:34:18.622]  It's from Shiloket.
[01:34:18.642 --> 01:34:21.404]  It's in the mountains of Tibet and Nepal.
[01:34:22.144 --> 01:34:25.266]  You can also get it in some of the mountains in Northern Europe.
[01:34:26.586 --> 01:34:29.188]  And it is basically these alluvial deposits.
[01:34:31.289 --> 01:34:32.390]  You can just go read about it.
[01:34:32.450 --> 01:34:33.310]  I take it.
[01:34:33.330 --> 01:34:34.851]  A lot of people in the office are taking it.
[01:34:35.829 --> 01:34:39.210]  It's amazing stuff, and that's one big part of the compound.
[01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:41.091]  It's got a bunch of other great things in it.
[01:34:41.791 --> 01:34:43.212]  Just go to their website and find out more.
[01:34:43.252 --> 01:34:44.873]  Blacklistedherb.com, 877-327-0365.
[01:34:45.093 --> 01:34:49.254]  And they've got a deal where you don't have to pay for it for 30 days.
[01:34:50.115 --> 01:34:53.476]  You know, they invoice you in, and in 30 days you don't like it, just tell them you don't have to pay for it.
[01:34:54.576 --> 01:34:56.177]  So that number is 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, or blacklistedherb.com.
[01:35:06.810 --> 01:35:14.574]  And then, of course, I would also add here that we have added a content distribution network to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:15.094 --> 01:35:17.335]  Because we already had it on three different servers.
[01:35:18.476 --> 01:35:27.340]  And usually it had fast downloads and fast streams, but sometimes, usually about 9 o'clock at night when everybody would hit it, and everybody shared their passcodes, it would get a little slow.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:29.681]  And I'd add another server and that wouldn't help.
[01:35:29.741 --> 01:35:35.184]  Well, we just got a content distribution network, very expensive, but we did it so we'd have high quality for you.
[01:35:36.565 --> 01:35:44.327]  And now all the new hot videos will be on that at first, and that way when you hit the older videos, they're on the other servers and they download quickly as well.
[01:35:47.849 --> 01:35:51.270]  To simplify it, we went to a content distribution network.
[01:35:52.710 --> 01:36:03.833]  It's in super high quality down to mid quality, depending on which version you want, depending on what your connection speed is, and it is a armory, a factory, a fulcrum of resistance.
[01:36:03.913 --> 01:36:04.634]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:36:06.474 --> 01:36:07.414]  15 cents a day.
[01:36:07.434 --> 01:36:08.474]  $5.95 a month.
[01:36:08.495 --> 01:36:14.056]  You can get a monthly membership or get a yearly membership and get three months free.
[01:36:16.836 --> 01:36:17.896]  And it's support.
[01:36:17.976 --> 01:36:18.796]  That's how we operate.
[01:36:18.816 --> 01:36:19.917]  It's how we pay for the servers.
[01:36:19.937 --> 01:36:21.157]  It's how we pay for the webmasters.
[01:36:22.357 --> 01:36:24.037]  And we're trying to expand here.
[01:36:24.057 --> 01:36:26.798]  I'm going to have a new webmaster, a new website I'm about to be announcing soon.
[01:36:26.858 --> 01:36:32.319]  I'm a couple weeks behind on it because I've been so busy with New York and finishing Endgame and all the rest of it.
[01:36:33.144 --> 01:36:41.569]  The pre-release of Loose Change Final Cut that I'm executive producer on, but we're doing a lot of other things too, but that's great.
[01:36:41.589 --> 01:36:43.810]  You support us, we get the word out, you fund us.
[01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:47.952]  That's a caveat, an addendum, a fringe benefit, a win-win, win-win.
[01:36:48.513 --> 01:37:01.100]  But the big issue is, hundreds of my TV shows, hundreds of in-studio special interviews, all 16 of my films, my e-book, Paul Watson's e-book, Order Out of Chaos, 9-11, Descent Into Tyranny, Order Out of Chaos is out of print.
[01:37:02.254 --> 01:37:10.479]  You can go burn it to disk, print copies off, burn any of my films, or the work I've done, or all the other media, or thousands of audio interviews to disk.
[01:37:10.519 --> 01:37:12.100]  Whatever subject you want, it's covered.
[01:37:13.521 --> 01:37:17.183]  It is the place to go burn them to disk and give them to people in high quality.
[01:37:17.564 --> 01:37:19.465]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:20.125 --> 01:37:22.387]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:23.988 --> 01:37:26.829]  And you know, for the first couple years we had it, it was on one server.
[01:37:26.849 --> 01:37:28.070]  Then we got it on two servers.
[01:37:28.090 --> 01:37:29.211]  Then we got it on three servers.
[01:37:30.742 --> 01:37:32.444]  People said, you know, sometimes it's slow.
[01:37:32.484 --> 01:37:33.264]  And I said, okay.
[01:37:33.404 --> 01:37:39.509]  And I signed a big, fat two-year contract with a big content distribution provider.
[01:37:40.890 --> 01:37:45.613]  And I mean, if we don't get members, it'll hurt us, though, because it's expensive.
[01:37:46.073 --> 01:37:48.355]  But now it is super fast download speeds.
[01:37:49.771 --> 01:37:51.975]  And we'll continue to try to make it better and better for you.
[01:37:51.995 --> 01:37:56.301]  So I want to thank all our longtime members, because without you we wouldn't even be able to do this show anymore.
[01:37:56.441 --> 01:38:00.908]  PrisonPlanet.tv is really one of the main pillars of support for what we do here.
[01:38:00.928 --> 01:38:03.412]  If you want hard copies of Martial Law, Road to Tyranny,
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:09.762]  Endgame will be out soon, you can't get it yet, but Terror Storm, Final Cut, it's all available at InfoWars.com.
[01:38:09.802 --> 01:38:16.084]  You can order hard copies right there, books or videos, or all the materials we carry, not just my material at InfoWars.com, or 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:38:16.104 --> 01:38:18.584]  You can also write to me at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:38:18.644 --> 01:38:20.945]  Okay, by the way, that's not my physical office.
[01:38:34.798 --> 01:38:39.921]  There is an inside drop box there that I've been using for 13 years and I'm not there.
[01:38:39.981 --> 01:38:44.483]  People keep showing up over there and I'm getting to the point where I'm going to have to move it and just go to a big P.O.
[01:38:44.523 --> 01:38:44.843]  box.
[01:38:45.584 --> 01:38:46.304]  But I don't want to do that.
[01:38:46.364 --> 01:38:49.225]  I like the fact that the mail goes in there, a big drop box in there.
[01:38:49.245 --> 01:38:52.607]  But everybody keeps showing up, doesn't believe that I'm not really there.
[01:38:52.687 --> 01:38:53.488]  Look, I'm not there.
[01:38:53.508 --> 01:38:55.168]  None of my people are there.
[01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:57.190]  That's where we have the mail delivered.
[01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:59.291]  I was going to have a bookstore here.
[01:38:59.331 --> 01:39:00.371]  What a crazy idea.
[01:39:00.391 --> 01:39:03.773]  There's no way I get any work done in this office if there was a bookstore at my physical office.
[01:39:05.049 --> 01:39:07.970]  So, again, just a side issue when I give that address out.
[01:39:08.650 --> 01:39:09.271]  It doesn't matter.
[01:39:09.331 --> 01:39:11.171]  People aren't going to stop knowing to check for themselves.
[01:39:11.291 --> 01:39:11.691]  Fine.
[01:39:11.892 --> 01:39:12.832]  Go talk to a brick wall.
[01:39:13.332 --> 01:39:17.654]  But, um, I'd love to be able to sit and have coffee with you, sit and talk to you.
[01:39:17.954 --> 01:39:18.894]  I don't have any time.
[01:39:18.954 --> 01:39:20.054]  I basically don't have a life.
[01:39:21.255 --> 01:39:22.575]  All I do is fight the New World Order.
[01:39:24.616 --> 01:39:25.236]  Oh my gosh.
[01:39:25.256 --> 01:39:26.777]  Alright, let's try to hurry through the calls here.
[01:39:27.017 --> 01:39:27.817]  Who's up next here?
[01:39:29.958 --> 01:39:31.759]  Dominique in Vancouver, Canada.
[01:39:31.779 --> 01:39:32.359]  You're on the air.
[01:39:33.127 --> 01:39:34.148]  Yeah, hi there, Alex.
[01:39:34.328 --> 01:39:35.009]  Hi.
[01:39:35.229 --> 01:39:36.590]  This is definitely conditioning.
[01:39:37.010 --> 01:39:38.551]  It's like 1984 on steroids.
[01:39:38.911 --> 01:39:48.479]  You can see this progression since Waco, especially, and right up until now, where people's constitutional rights are completely ignored, and people think it's good.
[01:39:48.679 --> 01:39:50.120]  Yeah, I mean, here's the point.
[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:51.581]  Cops didn't used to do this.
[01:39:51.601 --> 01:39:55.384]  They could make whatever claims and try to put perfume on the pig and make excuses.
[01:39:55.564 --> 01:39:56.725]  This didn't used to go on.
[01:39:57.185 --> 01:39:59.507]  I mean, there's hundreds of people a year dying from tasers.
[01:40:01.169 --> 01:40:01.630]  Exactly.
[01:40:01.670 --> 01:40:07.937]  I mean, if this happened, I believe, in the 70s or the 60s, I'd like to think it would be riots.
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:11.901]  Well, that's another thing, folks.
[01:40:11.941 --> 01:40:13.241]  The government doesn't run anything.
[01:40:13.562 --> 01:40:16.402]  When the black people rioted and burned down almost every U.S.
[01:40:16.442 --> 01:40:18.003]  city, the globalists had to back off.
[01:40:18.203 --> 01:40:22.885]  And I'm not advocating that, but my point is, the government isn't invincible and doesn't run everything.
[01:40:23.205 --> 01:40:25.545]  I don't want it to go to that, believe me.
[01:40:25.845 --> 01:40:28.606]  I want the government to stop being so criminal and to back off.
[01:40:28.866 --> 01:40:33.628]  I mean, when they are beating a city councilman up on video, they hit him in the back!
[01:40:34.227 --> 01:40:37.510]  The cops jumping from the back and then go after him!
[01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:41.173]  I mean, they're now beating us up on camera and then saying we're bad?
[01:40:42.093 --> 01:40:44.595]  Exactly, then they say he started the fight, or he's fighting.
[01:40:44.615 --> 01:40:48.799]  And he's being beaten up from behind, but that's alright, because they say so.
[01:40:49.599 --> 01:40:53.322]  You know, it's like, torture is good, torture is alright.
[01:40:53.442 --> 01:40:56.305]  Jack Bauer does it on TV, it's a good thing now.
[01:40:57.065 --> 01:40:59.007]  I just can't believe where we're going here.
[01:40:59.587 --> 01:41:00.748]  It's totally Orwellian.
[01:41:01.509 --> 01:41:02.790]  It's getting really scary.
[01:41:03.476 --> 01:41:14.983]  And I think that people should remember that they do have the right under the Constitution to march on Washington eventually and take back the power when they're not protecting or serving the Constitution anymore.
[01:41:15.363 --> 01:41:29.172]  By the way, that video of him getting beaten up, Council Member David Snyder, there in Indiana, I mean, the town marshal, the police chief, assaults him from behind.
[01:41:30.055 --> 01:41:39.019]  And then, literally, full force, beats him in the head with every, I mean, just full swings, full hooks, for over a minute and a half.
[01:41:39.159 --> 01:41:40.819]  I mean, savage attack.
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.961]  I mean, I'm speechless, I'm watching it!
[01:41:45.001 --> 01:41:49.363]  They assault you from behind, and then they arrest you!
[01:41:49.383 --> 01:41:51.104]  I mean, this is incredible!
[01:41:51.124 --> 01:41:54.405]  I think it's time for people to start getting angry here.
[01:41:56.246 --> 01:41:59.567]  I think it's really time for people to start doing something about these things.
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:05.243]  I don't know exactly what, but I'm afraid that eventually it's going to come down to an armed conflict.
[01:42:06.464 --> 01:42:11.788]  And when you see countries all over the world disarming their citizens, you've got to worry about them.
[01:42:11.988 --> 01:42:17.192]  When governments get that afraid of their citizens, you've got to wonder what's going to come next.
[01:42:17.352 --> 01:42:18.393]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[01:42:19.194 --> 01:42:26.319]  The government's going to get pushier and pushier, like they did with blacks, and instead of it just being black people, it's going to be yuppies out on the street burning things.
[01:42:30.436 --> 01:42:35.939]  If the government thinks the black folks gave them a run for their money, can they imagine what's going to happen when the Anglo-Saxons go crazy?
[01:42:40.682 --> 01:42:48.287]  They just keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing, and pushing, and pushing, and pushing, and pushing, and pushing, and pushing, and pushing, and pushing, and pushing.
[01:42:51.049 --> 01:42:58.153]  I've got footage here, I didn't get to this last week, where they're at a high school party, they put the guy in handcuffs because there's beer there,
[01:42:58.866 --> 01:43:02.968]  And the cop pulls his gun out and shoots himself, so he gets mad, so he just kills the young man.
[01:43:03.188 --> 01:43:04.709]  And the cop didn't get in trouble!
[01:43:06.330 --> 01:43:06.830]  Unbelievable.
[01:43:08.011 --> 01:43:13.753]  It's like in Waco, when basically they attacked them, and under the Constitution they have the right to defend themselves.
[01:43:14.394 --> 01:43:15.614]  But no, everybody forgot that.
[01:43:16.335 --> 01:43:19.997]  Everybody forgot that at Waco, basically these people were attacked.
[01:43:21.157 --> 01:43:23.859]  And they had a right, a God-given right to defend themselves.
[01:43:24.499 --> 01:43:25.900]  Absolutely, I appreciate your call.
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:26.640]  And here's the deal.
[01:43:27.734 --> 01:43:29.656]  I want everybody to have a good life.
[01:43:29.816 --> 01:43:35.100]  I want everybody to have a nice house with a swimming pool and an RV and, you know, two cars in the garage.
[01:43:36.681 --> 01:43:37.802]  I don't hate cops.
[01:43:38.442 --> 01:43:40.664]  I go to family reunions and there's a hundred people.
[01:43:40.684 --> 01:43:42.065]  There's probably twenty cops there.
[01:43:43.686 --> 01:43:46.508]  I mean, I'm a gun-toting, right-wing Texan, folks.
[01:43:46.568 --> 01:43:48.169]  I wasn't brought up disliking cops.
[01:43:49.090 --> 01:43:54.374]  But I remember we'd be deer hunting when I was a kid and the game warden would come up and he'd be somewhat polite.
[01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:58.185]  They're not nice now.
[01:43:58.665 --> 01:43:59.886]  See, everything has changed.
[01:44:00.126 --> 01:44:01.388]  I'm sick of it!
[01:44:01.948 --> 01:44:04.150]  Stop treating us like this!
[01:44:06.472 --> 01:44:07.473]  I'm tired of it!
[01:44:09.315 --> 01:44:10.956]  It makes you look bad!
[01:44:11.477 --> 01:44:12.718]  You're out of control!
[01:44:12.738 --> 01:44:22.767]  You know, if you go in a house and a 94-year-old woman's in a wheelchair and she's obviously blind... I mean, I got a dog that's blind.
[01:44:23.667 --> 01:44:25.308]  He just stares out into space.
[01:44:25.749 --> 01:44:28.330]  I mean, any fool can tell when somebody's blind.
[01:44:30.252 --> 01:44:34.154]  You don't taser the 94-year-old woman because she's deaf and blind!
[01:44:36.776 --> 01:44:42.721]  You don't taser a quadriplegic schizophrenic who isn't responding to you on the side of the street!
[01:44:43.321 --> 01:44:44.182]  Can't you tell?
[01:44:44.582 --> 01:44:47.064]  They've been thrown out of a government institution!
[01:44:47.184 --> 01:44:48.304]  They live on the street!
[01:44:48.865 --> 01:44:50.226]  They live in their own crap!
[01:44:51.638 --> 01:44:53.298]  That isn't enough for you, is it?
[01:44:53.578 --> 01:44:54.579]  You gotta kill him!
[01:44:57.559 --> 01:44:59.479]  Excuse me, but that's what it comes down to.
[01:44:59.499 --> 01:45:05.040]  Have some humanity!
[01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:08.241]  Stop acting like a bunch of macho, tough guys!
[01:45:12.002 --> 01:45:16.202]  If you wanna get in fights, go join the local boxing club in your city.
[01:45:16.462 --> 01:45:19.763]  And believe me, there's some guys who'll be more than happy to get in the ring with ya.
[01:45:21.141 --> 01:45:22.422]  Go take Jiu Jitsu!
[01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:23.082]  Go in there!
[01:45:23.722 --> 01:45:25.182]  Don't go where you're supposed to!
[01:45:25.523 --> 01:45:27.963]  Don't go out here and just run over us anymore!
[01:45:28.924 --> 01:45:30.344]  Because you are God!
[01:45:30.364 --> 01:45:33.765]  I mean, I see these cops with their shaved heads and devil tattoos all over them.
[01:45:33.785 --> 01:45:34.586]  Man, it's scary!
[01:45:36.006 --> 01:45:37.807]  Because they're out looking to be tough guys.
[01:45:38.147 --> 01:45:39.487]  They're out looking for trouble.
[01:45:39.728 --> 01:45:41.448]  Hey men, we're not looking for trouble.
[01:45:41.628 --> 01:45:42.749]  We want to go to the store.
[01:45:42.949 --> 01:45:43.889]  We want to go to the park.
[01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:45.169]  We want to be left alone.
[01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:47.250]  We don't want you pulling us over and wanting to search us.
[01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:49.311]  Just leave me alone!
[01:45:53.317 --> 01:45:54.618]  But you've got a corrupt culture.
[01:45:54.798 --> 01:45:56.699]  You've got a corrupt government that wants you to do bad.
[01:46:02.802 --> 01:46:04.223]  Ryan, where are you calling us from?
[01:46:04.243 --> 01:46:12.307]  Okay, let him go.
[01:46:13.148 --> 01:46:14.509]  John, where are you calling us from?
[01:46:15.949 --> 01:46:16.550]  Chicago.
[01:46:16.730 --> 01:46:17.030]  Welcome.
[01:46:17.722 --> 01:46:19.903]  Okay, uh, I saw you at Ground Zero.
[01:46:19.963 --> 01:46:24.264]  I'm the fellow that was standing there with the sign saying the New World Order murdered my cousin.
[01:46:24.605 --> 01:46:24.945]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:25.005 --> 01:46:25.505]  I saw you.
[01:46:25.525 --> 01:46:25.825]  I met you.
[01:46:25.845 --> 01:46:26.325]  How you doing?
[01:46:26.645 --> 01:46:27.346]  Alright, great.
[01:46:27.646 --> 01:46:30.707]  Uh, also about the, uh, the $4 billion put option.
[01:46:31.964 --> 01:46:35.867]  Was that notional value, or was that actually what they put up?
[01:46:35.907 --> 01:46:39.469]  Because it was notional, they probably only put up... No, no, no.
[01:46:39.509 --> 01:46:42.431]  I mean, that's what it would totally... I'm not an expert on puts.
[01:46:42.711 --> 01:46:45.352]  I've had put guys email me telling me different things, telling me I'm wrong.
[01:46:45.873 --> 01:46:57.960]  All I know is Dow Jones Industrial News reported over a billion dollar put, and then they reported puts on other areas of European exchanges that win leverage would be around four billion dollars.
[01:46:58.541 --> 01:46:59.001]  I don't know.
[01:46:59.381 --> 01:47:03.823]  Okay, because if it was that, if it was leveraged up to $4 billion, they'd probably only put up about 10%.
[01:47:04.063 --> 01:47:05.704]  Yeah, I know.
[01:47:05.744 --> 01:47:07.525]  That's exactly...exactly.
[01:47:07.545 --> 01:47:09.826]  But they'll lose that money if they don't get it.
[01:47:10.807 --> 01:47:13.608]  True, but he might be a high roller and is willing to risk it.
[01:47:13.948 --> 01:47:16.329]  Also, I'd like to applaud your web hosting service.
[01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:19.471]  I have my own website up on your service.
[01:47:19.571 --> 01:47:27.775]  It's called DuPage911Truth.org, and I urge all your listeners, you want to get active, support Alex, put up your own website.
[01:47:28.411 --> 01:47:39.738]  Well, we started the Infowars.net web hosting because Dwayne Cooch, who runs Infowars.net, has an internet service company and we tried to do that years ago to fund things.
[01:47:39.758 --> 01:47:43.681]  There's not even that many customers, I think a couple hundred, but they all seem to be pretty happy.
[01:47:43.701 --> 01:47:45.182]  It's excellent!
[01:47:46.514 --> 01:47:47.374]  Okay, that's it.
[01:47:47.675 --> 01:47:50.316]  Great seeing you in New York, and let's go out and get him.
[01:47:50.716 --> 01:47:51.396]  Thank you, sir.
[01:47:51.456 --> 01:47:51.996]  God bless you.
[01:47:52.016 --> 01:47:53.977]  Tell folks about your cousin, or you're already gone.
[01:47:53.997 --> 01:47:55.278]  No, I'm still here.
[01:47:55.358 --> 01:47:59.140]  My cousin had just graduated from Yale three months earlier.
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:05.602]  And he was working on the 93rd floor of the North Tower for Fred Alger Management Company.
[01:48:06.323 --> 01:48:09.524]  So he was right where the plane hit, I believe, at the North Tower.
[01:48:10.985 --> 01:48:13.986]  And it was just a total disaster for their family.
[01:48:17.006 --> 01:48:19.730]  When did you learn it was an inside job and what was that like for you?
[01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:23.856]  Well, I always suspected that they knew that it was coming.
[01:48:24.808 --> 01:48:29.872]  With the mainstream news reports that were leaking out about pre-warnings, I knew from the get-go.
[01:48:30.212 --> 01:48:35.957]  But I did not find out it was actually an inside job until early May of last year.
[01:48:36.017 --> 01:48:46.945]  By the way, Popular Mechanics says that that's a conspiracy theory, that AP, Reuters, BBC, Wall Street Journal, that none of them reported that the government was given exact specific warnings.
[01:48:47.165 --> 01:48:48.826]  Then it came out they lied, but they don't care.
[01:48:49.006 --> 01:48:50.446]  The general public can't find the U.S.
[01:48:50.506 --> 01:48:55.508]  on a map, so why shouldn't popular mechanics, the fathers of yellow journalism, tell people it doesn't exist?
[01:48:55.548 --> 01:48:56.728]  Go ahead, you found out last year.
[01:48:57.028 --> 01:48:58.248]  Yeah, I found out last year.
[01:48:58.849 --> 01:49:07.811]  How I found out was I saw Von Kleist on Glenn Beck's show on TV, and then I went to his website and the rest is history.
[01:49:07.871 --> 01:49:10.232]  I fell down the rabbit hole and there's no getting out, man.
[01:49:11.012 --> 01:49:12.533]  We've got to stop these psychopaths.
[01:49:13.963 --> 01:49:14.903]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:14.943 --> 01:49:18.965]  Yeah, I know most police are good people, just trying to do their job and get retirement.
[01:49:19.565 --> 01:49:21.245]  But I want to remind you who you work for.
[01:49:21.265 --> 01:49:27.487]  I want to remind you that the people you work for are the most evil people the world has ever seen.
[01:49:28.928 --> 01:49:32.669]  And they need you to follow their orders so they can carry out their operations.
[01:49:33.529 --> 01:49:35.570]  You better learn the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:49:36.110 --> 01:49:38.411]  You better rediscover what it means to be an American.
[01:49:39.091 --> 01:49:42.272]  We'll come back, take more calls, and I'm getting into financial news, and we start the third hour.
[01:49:45.533 --> 01:49:50.997]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:49:51.357 --> 01:49:58.982]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:49:59.679 --> 01:50:06.742]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:07.142 --> 01:50:18.567]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:18.887 --> 01:50:22.369]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:22.849 --> 01:50:24.770]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:25.110 --> 01:50:28.932]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:42.581 --> 01:50:47.823]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:47.943 --> 01:50:56.047]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:50:56.307 --> 01:51:03.350]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:04.811]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:04.891 --> 01:51:10.796]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:10.976 --> 01:51:16.080]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:25.068]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:25.328 --> 01:51:28.630]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:51:35.655 --> 01:51:45.201]  Are you tired of frequent urination?
[01:51:45.622 --> 01:51:47.863]  Do you drink a ton of water and still feel thirsty?
[01:51:48.183 --> 01:51:51.245]  The quantity of water you drink is not the key to hydration.
[01:51:51.426 --> 01:51:54.367]  The key to hydration is the correct clustering of water.
[01:51:54.548 --> 01:51:58.050]  When water has the ideal cluster, your cells will readily absorb it.
[01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:59.291]  We're good to go!
[01:52:23.604 --> 01:52:23.965]  I think so.
[01:53:08.647 --> 01:53:12.429]  Massive economic news immediately when I start the next hour.
[01:53:14.591 --> 01:53:16.592]  And a smattering of other news throughout the hour.
[01:53:17.312 --> 01:53:18.113]  More of your calls.
[01:53:23.716 --> 01:53:26.017]  Alright, let's uh... Who's up next year?
[01:53:26.037 --> 01:53:27.538]  I got my phone list scrambled every day.
[01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:31.741]  We just talked to John in Illinois.
[01:53:33.202 --> 01:53:34.222]  Perry in Washington.
[01:53:34.242 --> 01:53:34.823]  You're on the air.
[01:53:34.863 --> 01:53:35.463]  Go ahead, Perry.
[01:53:36.877 --> 01:53:37.278]  Hello.
[01:53:37.298 --> 01:53:38.660]  Hi, sir, go ahead.
[01:53:39.281 --> 01:53:52.241]  Hey, uh, I was just watching, uh, the InGlobal report on Free Speech TV, and they reported that that whole bomber crew that flew the nukes around a couple weeks ago, they all died while they were on leave.
[01:53:53.314 --> 01:53:54.215]  They're all dead.
[01:53:54.495 --> 01:54:02.965]  Yeah, you know, there's a big problem with the people putting that story out, and in fact, I did about an hour of research yesterday on this, and I had my crew do research here.
[01:54:03.545 --> 01:54:14.217]  There are people, most of the people who died from different military bases, died in automobile accidents in early July before the Minot crew even flew.
[01:54:14.932 --> 01:54:27.201]  Well, they've reported that one of them was found dead on a mountain in eastern Washington, and I live in Washington State.
[01:54:27.661 --> 01:54:29.222]  I haven't seen a report on that.
[01:54:29.282 --> 01:54:35.867]  Remember the same crew said there was going to be an Air Force stand down when it was just a drill for safety, and that we were going to be attacked last Friday?
[01:54:36.407 --> 01:54:36.627]  Right.
[01:54:37.128 --> 01:54:42.772]  And then they're always saying we're going to attack Iran today, today, always putting dates on it.
[01:54:43.624 --> 01:54:44.084]  Oh, no.
[01:54:44.204 --> 01:54:46.245]  I don't ever go without.
[01:54:46.425 --> 01:54:49.386]  And the same crew said that nukes were going to go off in Houston?
[01:54:50.087 --> 01:55:00.750]  Yeah, and well, and then we had the guy down in Texas there, Captain May, saying there was going to be a nuke in Portland, and I live 80 miles from Portland, so I was rather concerned about that.
[01:55:01.091 --> 01:55:02.671]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:55:03.772 --> 01:55:07.453]  There have been six people that have died from the Minot Base.
[01:55:08.073 --> 01:55:08.313]  Right.
[01:55:11.107 --> 01:55:13.568]  A couple of them were automobile accidents, drunk driving.
[01:55:14.028 --> 01:55:18.109]  One of them was visiting family back on the East Coast and died.
[01:55:18.169 --> 01:55:25.551]  That's the suspicious one because they won't say, and this happened four days ago, how he died, yet it just said under investigation.
[01:55:26.712 --> 01:55:29.192]  And then also, these people aren't crews.
[01:55:29.272 --> 01:55:30.633]  None of them were on that plane.
[01:55:31.093 --> 01:55:31.753]  None of them were.
[01:55:31.773 --> 01:55:34.174]  The people putting this out just say that!
[01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:42.233]  I do think that that whole story about the nukes flying around was put out by somebody probably at Barksdale.
[01:55:42.393 --> 01:55:45.495]  Yes, to create the illusion that nukes are free and nukes are not.
[01:55:45.555 --> 01:55:46.236]  I'm not so sure.
[01:55:46.296 --> 01:55:53.020]  It may have been an honest person in the Air Force trying to warn us because here's the deal with nukes.
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:58.783]  I've studied this for years because I was convinced in the 80s that Ronald Reagan was going to start World War III.
[01:55:58.823 --> 01:56:00.164]  So I studied nuclear
[01:56:01.173 --> 01:56:02.355]  Uh, protocol.
[01:56:02.675 --> 01:56:07.941]  They never put a warhead on a cruise missile unless it's going somewhere to be used.
[01:56:08.422 --> 01:56:11.205]  They are always shipped separately, like when they ship them
[01:56:12.066 --> 01:56:14.428]  Here's the deal, sir, let me just say something.
[01:56:14.869 --> 01:56:17.911]  If Bush wants to ship nukes over to the Middle East, he'll do it.
[01:56:17.951 --> 01:56:20.313]  There's 600 of them in Israel, conservatively.
[01:56:21.434 --> 01:56:23.095]  It used to be 400, now they've been 600.
[01:56:23.696 --> 01:56:25.237]  They have nukes all over the place.
[01:56:25.257 --> 01:56:27.759]  They've said they're going to use nukes in Iran if they want.
[01:56:27.779 --> 01:56:31.762]  I mean, it isn't like Bush has to sneak around with some nukes if he wants to use them.
[01:56:32.163 --> 01:56:33.404]  No, he will just do it.
[01:56:34.184 --> 01:56:36.006]  Yeah, no, they will just do it.
[01:56:36.848 --> 01:56:43.955]  There's an AP news report out today that Iran has planned to bomb Israel or whatever.
[01:56:44.015 --> 01:56:46.498]  That's how they spun it!
[01:56:48.059 --> 01:56:48.920]  Go ahead, just go ahead.
[01:56:49.541 --> 01:56:59.310]  You know, well that's an AP report that's on the mainstream news everywhere being blasted out there that Iran's planning to bomb Israel.
[01:56:59.370 --> 01:57:00.912]  Yeah, thanks for the call, gotta go.
[01:57:02.019 --> 01:57:03.920]  Let me just say exactly what that headline says.
[01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:06.020]  It is a deceptive, wicked headline.
[01:57:06.481 --> 01:57:09.602]  It says that they plan to bomb them.
[01:57:09.922 --> 01:57:11.602]  They're planning, making plans to bomb them.
[01:57:11.662 --> 01:57:16.624]  And you read it says, Iran is making plans for a response if struck.
[01:57:16.664 --> 01:57:20.885]  So it's a very deceptive, pro-war, yellow journalism headline.
[01:57:22.266 --> 01:57:26.927]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.789 --> 01:57:39.429]  Big Brother.
[01:57:40.090 --> 01:57:41.130]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:41.870 --> 01:57:43.611]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:43.631 --> 01:57:44.451]  You want answers?
[01:57:45.192 --> 01:57:47.112]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:47.132 --> 01:57:50.434]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:50.954 --> 01:57:55.075]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.823 --> 01:58:16.427]  When I start the next segment, I'm going to go directly into financial analysis with all the big developments that have happened yesterday evening and today.
[01:58:16.927 --> 01:58:20.069]  We have all the latest info here, right in front of me, right now.
[01:58:20.669 --> 01:58:22.050]  And we'll walk through what they're doing.
[01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:26.111]  I keep getting calls, I keep getting emails.
[01:58:26.171 --> 01:58:27.952]  I'm not mad at listeners for calling in about it.
[01:58:28.212 --> 01:58:29.213]  You shouldn't call in about it.
[01:58:30.133 --> 01:58:37.297]  You're welcome to call in about whatever you want, but it's the info of... I've been hearing since last Thursday that six airmen
[01:58:38.932 --> 01:58:45.835]  Six pilots, I guess they're all pilots on the B-52, no there's two pilots on the B-52, are all dead, all murdered.
[01:58:48.776 --> 01:58:51.557]  And then I go research it and that's not true.
[01:58:51.577 --> 01:58:54.738]  That's not true.
[01:58:57.219 --> 01:58:57.839]  What was it?
[01:58:58.179 --> 01:59:04.001]  Three, at least three, I have to go back and look at my notes, of the six people that are dead,
[01:59:05.174 --> 01:59:13.418]  Died in car wrecks and things of that nature months and months before the B-52 flew nukes to the wrong airbase.
[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:19.202]  Then I've got to have debates about are there nukes routinely on aircraft?
[01:59:20.062 --> 01:59:22.623]  Then is Bush trying to sneak nukes to Iran?
[01:59:22.924 --> 01:59:25.625]  He's publicly said they've got nukes already deployed and want to use them.
[01:59:33.061 --> 01:59:55.738]  And then people get into the story of the strange death of Todd Blue, Todd Alexander Blue, and people say that he was under investigation for the possible role of a nuclear weapons load on a B-52.
[01:59:56.559 --> 01:59:57.920]  But then there's no source for that.
[01:59:57.940 --> 01:59:58.760]  People just say it!
[01:59:59.801 --> 02:00:00.622]  They just say that
[02:00:06.067 --> 02:00:07.308]  No source, just so you can say it.
[02:00:12.391 --> 02:00:12.851]  Interesting.
[02:00:17.815 --> 02:00:19.516]  I don't know what to say about our movement anymore.
[02:00:20.837 --> 02:00:25.300]  I get calls constantly about, did I hear the rumors about FEMA camps?
[02:00:26.408 --> 02:00:29.211]  And then it's always some weird disinfo added on to it.
[02:00:29.231 --> 02:00:38.341]  I go, well, here, let me give you mainline documents, Army websites, they admit it all, Houston Chronicle, and they go, no, no, I want to talk about this disinfo.
[02:00:41.104 --> 02:00:43.207]  And I say, well, I really want to get you to look at this.
[02:00:44.306 --> 02:00:45.866]  Come on, let's talk about real things.
[02:00:45.886 --> 02:00:46.787]  Let's give them numbers.
[02:00:46.867 --> 02:00:47.287]  PDD 51.
[02:00:47.447 --> 02:00:50.208]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[02:00:50.248 --> 02:00:51.348]  Military Commissions Act.
[02:00:51.788 --> 02:00:54.349]  Michelle Malkin wrote a book on the case for internment camps.
[02:00:54.369 --> 02:00:56.029]  I mean, let's talk about camps.
[02:00:56.589 --> 02:01:01.131]  Please, instead of just telling everyone you heard there might be camps, let me give you documentation.
[02:01:01.831 --> 02:01:02.191]  No!
[02:01:04.992 --> 02:01:06.132]  We're gonna spread rumor!
[02:01:09.893 --> 02:01:13.674]  So when people hear me talk about camps, they think, oh, that's one of those people shooting their mouth off.
[02:01:15.129 --> 02:01:18.571]  And there's people in our movement who always seize on this.
[02:01:18.691 --> 02:01:19.652]  It's publicity stunts.
[02:01:20.913 --> 02:01:26.556]  Instead of freaking out over Alan Greenspan coming out and saying, kill the economy, basically, it's going to go down.
[02:01:26.596 --> 02:01:28.517]  And with that statement, he knows that will push it down.
[02:01:30.678 --> 02:01:40.885]  Or instead of talking about just incredible things that are sensational in and of themselves on their face, it's always got to be some made-up baloney.
[02:01:42.065 --> 02:01:43.026]  And you know why people do that?
[02:01:43.812 --> 02:01:46.433]  They do that so they can be the exclusive on it.
[02:01:46.954 --> 02:01:48.895]  They do that so they can put it out.
[02:01:48.975 --> 02:01:55.198]  See, if you make something up like no planes hitting Tower 1 or 2 or holograms, you're the one making that up.
[02:01:55.218 --> 02:01:55.998]  You're going to get attention.
[02:01:56.318 --> 02:02:01.041]  You're not like all the other scholars and architects and engineers and numbers and math and science.
[02:02:01.601 --> 02:02:09.165]  You've become the center of attention saying that Casper the Friendly Ghost did it with his band of... Octarians!
[02:02:11.488 --> 02:02:14.189]  And it's the same thing with all of this, and I just refuse to be part of it.
[02:02:15.330 --> 02:02:15.610]  Okay?
[02:02:16.690 --> 02:02:17.831]  I refuse to be part of it.
[02:02:18.471 --> 02:02:22.072]  We got all these open preparations for war, and we can't talk about any of those.
[02:02:23.233 --> 02:02:28.795]  We gotta talk about people that died in the military before this P-52 incident.
[02:02:30.055 --> 02:02:31.376]  And don't let the facts get in your way.
[02:02:35.174 --> 02:02:40.139]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:02:40.439 --> 02:02:45.884]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:02:45.924 --> 02:02:50.208]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:02:50.548 --> 02:02:53.570]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:02:53.871 --> 02:02:57.314]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:02:57.634 --> 02:03:06.978]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:03:07.238 --> 02:03:10.739]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:03:10.979 --> 02:03:18.082]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:03:37.424 --> 02:03:42.910]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:43.271 --> 02:03:50.879]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:51.607 --> 02:03:58.651]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:59.051 --> 02:04:10.477]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:10.797 --> 02:04:14.319]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:16.721]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:17.021 --> 02:04:20.863]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:35.313 --> 02:04:42.097]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two books set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:04:42.457 --> 02:04:48.860]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:04:49.341 --> 02:04:59.246]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:04:59.726 --> 02:05:03.188]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:05:03.488 --> 02:05:06.170]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:09.492]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[02:05:10.053 --> 02:05:13.975]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.
[02:05:14.035 --> 02:05:15.556]  Box 969 Soquel, S-O-Q-U-E-L, California 95073.
[02:05:15.596 --> 02:05:19.279]  $32 to Radio Liberty Box 969 Soquel, California 95073 or call 1-800-544-8927.
[02:05:19.299 --> 02:05:19.359]  1-800-544-8927.
[02:05:34.897 --> 02:05:40.419]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:06.596 --> 02:06:13.819]  Yeah, I mean, I've spent hours of valuable time wasted researching the news about the B-52 and the nukes and all this.
[02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:24.204]  I mean, the globalists didn't need to hijack some B-52 by remote control to have it fire cruise missiles and blow up cities to blame it on Al-Qaeda.
[02:06:25.905 --> 02:06:26.745]  It just never ends.
[02:06:26.865 --> 02:06:32.147]  And it's sites that push paranormal stuff and Yeti and all that that are putting it out.
[02:06:32.447 --> 02:06:33.888]  And just say La Vie, man, okay?
[02:06:34.568 --> 02:06:35.909]  You want to do that, go right ahead.
[02:06:36.835 --> 02:06:41.436]  I got all these radio shows calling me up wanting me to come on and talk about it and I just go, I'm not going to come on and talk about that.
[02:06:42.556 --> 02:06:48.517]  I'm not going to come on and talk about how on this date Houston will be nuked.
[02:06:49.418 --> 02:06:50.618]  You can just listen to that stuff.
[02:06:50.638 --> 02:06:54.279]  It's about as credible as a... It doesn't matter.
[02:06:54.299 --> 02:06:56.459]  We just have a little bit of discernment out there.
[02:06:56.499 --> 02:06:57.639]  Just a tiny little bit.
[02:06:57.659 --> 02:07:01.120]  I mean, it's the same crowds.
[02:07:02.902 --> 02:07:04.825]  We're always claiming there's a secret U.S.
[02:07:04.905 --> 02:07:07.448]  Ambassador with trillions of dollars.
[02:07:08.890 --> 02:07:16.821]  And if you just send us some money and support us, we'll get those trillions and save the economy.
[02:07:16.941 --> 02:07:19.084]  I mean, just totally made up.
[02:07:20.541 --> 02:07:24.722]  I've had listeners call me and argue with me and go, I'm working with guys in Nigeria!
[02:07:24.742 --> 02:07:28.003]  They're sending me 14 mil and I just send them 5,000!
[02:07:28.863 --> 02:07:36.465]  And I sent the 5,000 and they're on the phone with me telling me, if I just send 5,000 more I'm gonna get the 14 million!
[02:07:38.885 --> 02:07:42.306]  And I'm like, that's a 10 year old internet scam, they run them out of Nigeria.
[02:07:42.886 --> 02:07:46.407]  Because if one out of a thousand believes the email, they think you've hit it rich!
[02:07:50.273 --> 02:07:51.093]  People don't listen.
[02:07:52.314 --> 02:07:53.374]  It's not just my listeners.
[02:07:54.074 --> 02:07:55.275]  It's a lot of people don't listen.
[02:07:56.715 --> 02:07:58.796]  A lot of people go for that Nigerian scam.
[02:08:02.498 --> 02:08:04.418]  I mean, it's the same thing over and over again.
[02:08:06.079 --> 02:08:09.780]  I will not sell magical water machines, no matter how much the sponsors offer me.
[02:08:11.161 --> 02:08:17.243]  I will not sell magical cure-all creams or potions or other snake oils.
[02:08:18.690 --> 02:08:23.454]  I will not pitch magical magic beam machines that heal everything.
[02:08:25.015 --> 02:08:27.757]  And I will not be part of all of it that's discredited this movement.
[02:08:29.478 --> 02:08:34.261]  It's bad enough sometimes I got to sit here with sponsors playing in the background that I disagree with.
[02:08:35.522 --> 02:08:43.868]  I mean I'll tell you to buy high quality vitamin drinks and I'll sit here and tell you buy gold which is more than doubled in price now and I'll tell you buy guns and I'm not selling them.
[02:08:44.833 --> 02:08:52.884]  But I got a conscience, and that's why I've been successful, because for all my problems and all my foibles, this is a real show with real information.
[02:08:52.924 --> 02:08:54.345]  This is not the kook hour.
[02:08:55.307 --> 02:08:55.627]  Okay?
[02:08:57.490 --> 02:08:58.791]  That is not what this is.
[02:08:58.811 --> 02:09:02.937]  I put my life on the line to cover these issues.
[02:09:04.818 --> 02:09:15.861]  And what irritates me is I get criticized because I won't jump into every unfounded, disproven, half-baked piece of disinfo that is spewed out.
[02:09:18.781 --> 02:09:33.845]  Just because the mainstream media spins and lies and obfuscates and engages in every known form of chicanery and skullduggery doesn't mean that the entire alternative media is telling the truth.
[02:09:35.746 --> 02:09:38.467]  Or the alternative media has all the answers.
[02:09:38.967 --> 02:09:43.908]  Or just because somebody in the alternative movement said something, that makes it so.
[02:09:50.830 --> 02:09:58.432]  Now I pioneered looking for drills and watching for drills to expose when the New World Order is going to strike.
[02:09:59.313 --> 02:10:04.354]  But if we say every drill is imminent and every drill is going to be it,
[02:10:05.228 --> 02:10:14.276]  And then attach to it disparate pieces of information that... I mean, I looked into this plane thing, and they were going to nuke us, and they've killed all the airmen situation.
[02:10:14.637 --> 02:10:15.838]  And it's not true!
[02:10:17.839 --> 02:10:18.500]  So far!
[02:10:20.242 --> 02:10:31.592]  At least half of the six dead airmen died in automobile accidents and other events around the country in the months before this event with the nukes going to the wrong place.
[02:10:35.333 --> 02:10:50.469]  Then I had to hear that the safety drill was unprecedented, it had never been done, there had never been an Air Force stand down, and that this was the end, and that when nothing happened Friday, the people that put this info out didn't get to say, see, we stopped it!
[02:10:54.930 --> 02:10:57.132]  I happen to make some calls to people I know in the Air Force.
[02:10:57.152 --> 02:11:00.775]  I happen to have one who was there in their six years loading weapons on planes.
[02:11:01.115 --> 02:11:01.676]  No, no, no.
[02:11:01.716 --> 02:11:02.977]  All the time we have stand downs.
[02:11:03.057 --> 02:11:05.039]  Every year they have a complete Air Force stand down.
[02:11:05.239 --> 02:11:11.124]  That doesn't mean all the aircraft is a stand down in maintenance with the main fleets to go over safety.
[02:11:12.365 --> 02:11:14.687]  Just like they have safety day if you work at Walmart.
[02:11:19.033 --> 02:11:21.376]  So see, that claim that it was unprecedented wasn't true.
[02:11:21.716 --> 02:11:25.840]  The claim that they all died and that they were involved in the air crew isn't true.
[02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:30.826]  I spent hours going and looking at this, and it's not true!
[02:11:30.846 --> 02:11:32.587]  And I'll never hear the end of it!
[02:11:33.028 --> 02:11:35.711]  And the people that put this disinfo out, they won't be discredited.
[02:11:35.991 --> 02:11:38.934]  Like the people that said that Barbara Olsen, who supposedly died on 77,
[02:11:40.456 --> 02:11:51.245]  Had been arrested in Europe, or that Alan Greenspan had been arrested in Europe, or that some imaginary fake ambassador that never existed had four trillion dollars.
[02:11:51.325 --> 02:11:52.546]  It's just all made up!
[02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:57.911]  And you've got to know that that stuff's done on purpose.
[02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:20.568]  And you see these people that come out in the 9-11 Truth Movement for a year, they act very credible, they act very serious, then a year later, just like in the JFK assassination, where they, with Jim Garrison in trial, his fingerprint expert got up and acted totally crazy on the stand for the first time ever, and said he fingerprinted his daughter every night to make sure it was still her.
[02:12:24.889 --> 02:12:29.191]  Same thing, they come out after a year and go, there were no planes, there were holograms, it was space beams.
[02:12:29.732 --> 02:12:32.493]  So obvious, it makes me sick!
[02:12:38.709 --> 02:12:39.969]  Let's stick to what we know.
[02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:45.911]  President Bush has declared himself dictator, taking continuity of government away from the Congress and giving it to the UN.
[02:12:46.411 --> 02:12:52.653]  All in black and white, all in the SPP documents released one month ago, all in the public announcements of the White House.
[02:12:52.993 --> 02:12:56.534]  Unbelievable, earth-shattering, totally incredible.
[02:12:57.794 --> 02:13:00.915]  Cops are tasering quadriplegics in wheelchairs till they die.
[02:13:01.375 --> 02:13:06.677]  They are beating up city councilmen in the city council and then charging them when they punch him in the back.
[02:13:08.487 --> 02:13:13.909]  There are 30 million illegals, they've introduced bills to totally legalize them again, called the DREAM Act.
[02:13:14.789 --> 02:13:16.829]  The dollar is plunging rapidly.
[02:13:19.170 --> 02:13:27.192]  All of this is going on and happening, and half our movement is running around talking about holograms, chupacabras, and dead airmen.
[02:13:32.114 --> 02:13:35.995]  And I'm not here to police people, but just don't expect me to run with all of you.
[02:13:36.596 --> 02:13:44.502]  I used to try to help people in this movement, other, quote, leaders movement, and I found out they were all jealous and just detested me when I tried to give my hand up, so why even help them to begin with?
[02:13:45.923 --> 02:13:50.446]  I hope and dream for all of you out there to be leaders in your area.
[02:13:50.686 --> 02:13:51.867]  We are waking people up.
[02:13:51.907 --> 02:13:53.348]  We are discrediting the New World Order.
[02:13:53.548 --> 02:13:54.829]  We are having huge effects.
[02:13:56.570 --> 02:14:03.475]  But we don't have enough independent leaders out there who are good people and who are focused and who are serious
[02:14:04.719 --> 02:14:07.241]  To take action, and we need you to step to the plate now.
[02:14:07.301 --> 02:14:09.203]  Let me get into economic news before we run out of time here.
[02:14:12.345 --> 02:14:14.427]  Let me just give you a smattering of it.
[02:14:15.108 --> 02:14:17.770]  Really bad economic news showing us where this country's going.
[02:14:18.931 --> 02:14:20.392]  I have the transcript of her speech.
[02:14:20.412 --> 02:14:21.753]  You couldn't make this stuff up.
[02:14:24.736 --> 02:14:27.318]  I mean, all week we should have just been talking about the immigration issue.
[02:14:27.538 --> 02:14:27.998]  That's huge.
[02:14:28.099 --> 02:14:29.279]  All week we should have been talking about Hillary.
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:30.881]  First, last week
[02:14:33.738 --> 02:14:41.463]  Another Democratic presidential candidate, John Edwards, comes out and says that you will have to go to the doctor from cradle to grave every year for checkups.
[02:14:41.923 --> 02:14:48.147]  Sounds reasonable, but again, it's about the nanny state, the eugenic state, controlling your life, forcing vaccines on you, you name it.
[02:14:48.947 --> 02:14:55.291]  Hillary comes out and says, this is a quote, you won't be able to have a job without having insurance.
[02:14:56.672 --> 02:15:00.434]  That brings total federal control over all jobs, total surveillance, total tracking,
[02:15:02.623 --> 02:15:05.065]  And she went on to say, and you'll have to go to the doctor every year.
[02:15:05.505 --> 02:15:10.949]  Again, that's them totally getting in your life, totally running your life, totally bankrupting the government even more.
[02:15:14.392 --> 02:15:18.075]  I mean, to be bad enough, they said, we're just going to pay for the insurance for 15 million Americans.
[02:15:22.298 --> 02:15:23.939]  But no, they just say, we're taking everything over.
[02:15:29.326 --> 02:15:31.847]  Now, on the main economic front, listen to these headlines.
[02:15:31.867 --> 02:15:35.449]  Fed rate cut could recede quickly.
[02:15:38.350 --> 02:15:43.512]  Pickens, crude oil could hit $100 a barrel by year end.
[02:15:47.494 --> 02:15:52.997]  PrisonPlanet.com, that last story was out of CNBC.
[02:15:55.043 --> 02:15:59.227]  China's ultimatum, let us invade Taiwan or we'll dump the dollar.
[02:15:59.307 --> 02:16:07.053]  Financial analyst says China could use huge dollar reserves as blackmail by and for beefing superpower status.
[02:16:09.896 --> 02:16:15.641]  Another key article that we put together up there is about Greenspan's attempts to destroy the U.S.
[02:16:15.681 --> 02:16:16.061]  economy.
[02:16:16.381 --> 02:16:17.442]  That's the big news.
[02:16:17.482 --> 02:16:20.705]  That's what all these announcements are when they say the economy is imploding.
[02:16:21.878 --> 02:16:24.001]  Credit turmoil set to benefit big banks.
[02:16:24.041 --> 02:16:24.902]  This is the key story.
[02:16:25.303 --> 02:16:37.039]  Large banks with big ballot sheets and access to central bank liquidity could be poised to benefit from the recent turmoil in financial markets, says ratings agency Moody's in a report on Wednesday.
[02:16:37.811 --> 02:16:52.538]  As the crisis in confidence in the credit has reduced access to cheap capital markets, funding for non-bank participants such as hedge funds, the ratings agencies argue that banks are set to play an increasing important role as the much-needed distributors of central bank liquidity.
[02:16:52.578 --> 02:16:57.920]  Yeah, they got all these little sub-licensed bodies to go out and sell paper.
[02:16:58.621 --> 02:17:01.342]  Then the big banks two months ago just stopped buying it.
[02:17:02.037 --> 02:17:09.662]  That's all that happened to then blow out all their competition and consolidate it while damaging the wider economy on a bigger scale.
[02:17:11.624 --> 02:17:13.085]  Oil goes to an all-time record of $82.
[02:17:13.185 --> 02:17:18.629]  Gold goes to an all-time record of $716-something.
[02:17:20.470 --> 02:17:20.750]  U.S.
[02:17:20.790 --> 02:17:22.251]  gold futures hit 28-year peak.
[02:17:22.311 --> 02:17:26.114]  We're going to tell you what it all means on the other side and go over it.
[02:17:26.674 --> 02:17:27.335]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:17:27.355 --> 02:17:27.755]  Stay with me.
[02:17:34.835 --> 02:17:39.439]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[02:17:39.639 --> 02:17:44.082]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.

[02:18:21.683 --> 02:18:22.923]  The Berkey Security Pack.
[02:18:23.123 --> 02:18:24.324]  A retail value of $518 for only $399.
[02:18:27.205 --> 02:18:28.670]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:28.710 --> 02:18:29.954]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:34.420 --> 02:18:35.400]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:40.262]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:18:40.422 --> 02:18:48.225]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:18:48.505 --> 02:18:53.867]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:18:54.067 --> 02:19:01.049]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:19:01.349 --> 02:19:06.695]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:19:06.956 --> 02:19:11.681]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:19:12.021 --> 02:19:19.610]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:19:19.950 --> 02:19:26.192]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:19:26.512 --> 02:19:28.172]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.373 --> 02:19:32.653]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.753 --> 02:19:34.154]  Attention!
[02:19:34.314 --> 02:19:36.254]  This is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[02:19:36.454 --> 02:19:40.715]  Honeybees are now mysteriously vanishing at an astonishing pace across the entire country.
[02:19:40.875 --> 02:19:43.756]  Why is this urgent message about honeybees so desperately important?
[02:19:44.036 --> 02:19:44.977]  The answer is easy.
[02:19:45.137 --> 02:19:51.340]  You see, honeybees produce a unique compound, fed only to the queen, that makes her live six times longer than other bees in the hive.
[02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:55.603]  Some researchers now believe the compound may have miraculous effects on humans as well.
[02:19:55.783 --> 02:20:01.746]  The compound is called Royal Jelly, and is now available in an all-new, ultra-purified form called Gelosine Gold.
[02:20:01.926 --> 02:20:07.309]  The product has been designed for purity-conscious Americans who are concerned about contaminated royal jelly entering the U.S.
[02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.829]  from Asia.
[02:20:08.010 --> 02:20:12.332]  Solutions from Science is the only company authorized to sell Gelosine Gold in the U.S.
[02:20:12.432 --> 02:20:12.752]  I think so.
[02:20:33.689 --> 02:20:34.749]  Hey, Jack Blood here.
[02:20:34.969 --> 02:20:40.951]  I think that if we could see the germs and potential biohazards all around us in our daily surroundings, we would turn into Howard Hughes.
[02:20:41.271 --> 02:20:45.472]  We try not to think about it primarily because we might think there's nothing we can do about it.
[02:20:45.772 --> 02:20:46.532]  Not so fast.
[02:20:46.612 --> 02:20:47.873]  Now there is a solution.
[02:20:48.053 --> 02:20:52.234]  I'm talking about Hazurid Complete Protection Kit, available now at Hazurid.com.
[02:20:53.334 --> 02:21:02.036]  This is the single solution that is tame enough to safely conquer everyday household and business cleaning chores, yet strong enough to decontaminate biological hazards.
[02:21:02.256 --> 02:21:06.757]  Hazurid fights infectious disease and unsurpassed odor, mold, and allergens.

[02:21:17.699 --> 02:21:19.001]  Call them now to order 800-675-0323.
[02:21:19.061 --> 02:21:19.281]  That's 800-675-0323.
[02:21:19.301 --> 02:21:20.502]  Or go to the web, www.hazard.com.
[02:21:20.543 --> 02:21:21.223]  H-A-Z-A-R-I-D, hazard.com.
[02:21:21.263 --> 02:21:22.445]  Tell them Jack Blood sent you.
[02:21:54.235 --> 02:21:54.736]  Alright.
[02:21:54.816 --> 02:21:59.060]  Let me break down what's happening real simply.
[02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:25.194]  The private central banks of the world announced two years ago that they plan to incrementally destroy the dollar, bring it down to at least 30% of its previous value until the Euro fully replaces it.
[02:22:26.675 --> 02:22:30.076]  They even said this in the 70s, but they said they were implementing the plan two years ago.
[02:22:31.056 --> 02:22:38.119]  They will then claim that the dollar has plunged so far after 5-10 years, it could even be that long, of recession.
[02:22:39.777 --> 02:22:59.604]  That if we dollarize Latin America, the original plan was the Pan-American Union, step-by-step it'll be North American, then the bankers will boost it up, make it rise, save the world reserve currency, but then they're going to have a speculation war between the Euro and the Amaro when both are owned by the same families, the shareholders of the banks that issue it.
[02:23:00.905 --> 02:23:02.285]  They said this in the 70s.
[02:23:02.605 --> 02:23:04.026]  David Rockefeller, this is public!
[02:23:05.450 --> 02:23:07.471]  That's how I... I didn't predict any of it.
[02:23:07.491 --> 02:23:08.571]  Like, how did you know this would happen?
[02:23:08.711 --> 02:23:09.531]  They told us!
[02:23:12.332 --> 02:23:15.853]  But before they can do this to us, they have to put on a little song and dance.
[02:23:15.893 --> 02:23:25.036]  So, the song and dance is, well, you guys have overspent on the adjustable rate mortgages and all of the subprime mortgages to bad...
[02:23:27.771 --> 02:23:37.003]  People with bad credit, and you caused it all, but okay, if you demand an interest rate cut, it'll hurt the dollar further, but gee willikers, we'll do it.
[02:23:38.766 --> 02:23:44.734]  And they cut the interest rate, which makes more lending take place.
[02:23:46.221 --> 02:23:56.126]  And more borrowing take place, and more debt take place, but then it means the foreigners, where they can get 7-8% from other treasuries, says, no, we're not going to buy even less dollars now.
[02:23:56.426 --> 02:24:03.510]  And so the dollar goes down even further, and oil goes up another $2, and gold, is it $7.26 right now?
[02:24:06.331 --> 02:24:08.913]  They've been artificially suppressing that for 50 years.
[02:24:08.933 --> 02:24:10.013]  There's been lawsuits over it.
[02:24:10.193 --> 02:24:11.254]  The documents have come out.
[02:24:12.395 --> 02:24:16.438]  I mean, we're seeing things we've never seen before right now.
[02:24:19.340 --> 02:24:21.962]  It was $310 an ounce.
[02:24:23.343 --> 02:24:29.427]  I was buying it for below melt in 2000, 2001.
[02:24:32.169 --> 02:24:34.951]  And all the talking heads said, you're a kook if you buy gold.
[02:24:35.011 --> 02:24:39.114]  I'll be at the gym on X-Drives bikes, next to some old guy who's a stockbroker.
[02:24:39.134 --> 02:24:40.595]  And he goes, oh, you're buying gold.
[02:24:40.635 --> 02:24:41.476]  You're an idiot.
[02:24:42.566 --> 02:24:45.888]  And that old guy, I'm sure, he still thinks he's making money because the stock market's at $14,000.
[02:24:46.428 --> 02:24:49.189]  But that's with a dollar that's devalued by half.
[02:24:49.429 --> 02:24:51.010]  But look, here's what's happening.
[02:24:51.310 --> 02:24:56.253]  Greenspan and all the head guys come out and bash the dollar, bash the U.S., say the dollar's going to get replaced.
[02:24:56.673 --> 02:24:58.674]  Stuff they've never said before, death knell.
[02:24:59.767 --> 02:25:16.853]  And then that causes the long slide downwards, but then so it doesn't completely plunge, the plunge they orchestrated, then they come in and save it with the interest rate cut, but then Bernanke comes out on the heels of it today and says, oh, but that's not going to last long, it's really bad what's coming!
[02:25:20.629 --> 02:25:32.232]  So right now they're just literally, it'd be like if somebody was drowning and you stuck your hand down off the side of the boat to give them a hand and you gave them a hand and then you stabbed them with a dagger in the throat and then laughed and let go of them.
[02:25:35.370 --> 02:25:36.671]  Again, it's the song and dance.
[02:25:36.731 --> 02:25:37.632]  I have to hear people.
[02:25:38.152 --> 02:25:42.836]  I heard them chattering last night at a school event, going, Oh, at least they cut the rate.
[02:25:42.916 --> 02:25:43.356]  It's helping.
[02:25:43.476 --> 02:25:43.877]  Oh, good.
[02:25:44.377 --> 02:25:45.398]  Things will be fine then.
[02:25:45.838 --> 02:25:46.979]  No, they won't be fine.
[02:25:47.199 --> 02:25:48.600]  They're killing the dollar!
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:50.582]  People wanted to still have the dollar.
[02:25:51.062 --> 02:25:55.385]  Even though the globalists for years have been trying to kill it, people are still holding on to them.
[02:25:55.405 --> 02:26:02.050]  So now the Greenspan, Volcker, the Treasury Secretary, they're all running around.
[02:26:02.130 --> 02:26:02.891]  The Dexchecker,
[02:26:03.860 --> 02:26:11.681]  They're all, the head of the German Bundesbank, they're all running around talking trash about the dollar, our own government is!
[02:26:12.942 --> 02:26:15.222]  And then they cut the rates and go, oh, that's what you wanted.
[02:26:15.482 --> 02:26:17.743]  Your fiat stock market went up a little bit.
[02:26:18.643 --> 02:26:20.563]  Well, they stabbed another hole in the dollar.
[02:26:23.304 --> 02:26:24.684]  And that's pretty sophisticated, isn't it?
[02:26:24.804 --> 02:26:28.625]  I mean, you try to explain that to an average American, who again, doesn't, can't find the U.S.
[02:26:28.685 --> 02:26:30.465]  on a map, but they can find the golf course.
[02:26:32.910 --> 02:26:37.412]  They can sure, you know, ownin' their car dealership, they can sure find their mistress.
[02:26:39.493 --> 02:26:42.515]  They can't find their 15-year-old when he's out back smokin' crack, though.
[02:26:43.815 --> 02:26:51.259]  We're a decadent, pot-bellied, myself included, nation, falling apart at the edges, disintegrating.
[02:26:56.662 --> 02:26:57.983]  And, here it is!
[02:27:00.164 --> 02:27:00.804]  They admit it!
[02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:07.001]  Credit turmoil could benefit banks.
[02:27:07.201 --> 02:27:08.501]  We're going to talk more about this when we get back.
[02:27:08.882 --> 02:27:11.983]  Then I'm going to get into what $100 a barrel of oil are going to mean.
[02:27:13.023 --> 02:27:15.884]  Remember we told you Bilderberg planned that two years ago?
[02:27:16.765 --> 02:27:21.287]  Now they've got all the top economists out saying it, getting you ready for it!
[02:27:25.008 --> 02:27:25.909]  We're on the march.
[02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:27.989]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:28.930 --> 02:27:31.611]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:35.433 --> 02:27:36.594]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[02:27:36.614 --> 02:27:38.995]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:27:39.115 --> 02:27:42.096]  Allison's Natural Antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:27:42.156 --> 02:27:42.836]  is a real thing.
[02:27:42.917 --> 02:27:49.740]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:51.081]  We're good to go.

[02:28:34.611 --> 02:28:34.891]  Hemp.
[02:28:35.131 --> 02:28:37.173]  The superfood for you and your family.
[02:28:37.573 --> 02:28:40.835]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[02:28:41.316 --> 02:28:41.596]  Hemp.
[02:28:41.996 --> 02:28:44.758]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[02:28:45.098 --> 02:28:45.399]  Hemp.
[02:28:45.739 --> 02:28:52.203]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[02:28:52.544 --> 02:28:55.806]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[02:28:56.066 --> 02:28:59.669]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[02:29:00.249 --> 02:29:04.571]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments.
[02:29:04.931 --> 02:29:11.353]  Loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[02:29:11.673 --> 02:29:15.955]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[02:29:16.175 --> 02:29:18.055]  Could this be the government's best kept secret?
[02:29:18.295 --> 02:29:21.437]  Call today at 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[02:29:21.457 --> 02:29:21.617]  Learn!
[02:29:25.558 --> 02:29:25.798]  Help.
[02:29:26.258 --> 02:29:26.518]  Shop.
[02:29:26.838 --> 02:29:28.179]  At HempUSA.org.
[02:29:28.379 --> 02:29:29.439]  We do not charge for shipping.
[02:29:29.499 --> 02:29:30.940]  That's 908-691-2608.
[02:29:31.740 --> 02:29:34.061]  Or go to HempUSA.org today.
[02:29:34.701 --> 02:29:36.681]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[02:29:36.941 --> 02:29:39.982]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:29:40.242 --> 02:29:45.024]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:29:45.344 --> 02:29:48.085]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[02:29:48.325 --> 02:29:53.006]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[02:29:53.286 --> 02:29:55.187]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:29:55.667 --> 02:30:05.613]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology, and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[02:30:05.993 --> 02:30:10.675]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[02:30:11.055 --> 02:30:14.557]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars!
[02:30:14.797 --> 02:30:16.939]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[02:30:17.259 --> 02:30:19.420]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:20.060]  All right.
[02:30:47.421 --> 02:30:49.323]  I'm gonna try to walk through calmly.
[02:30:50.063 --> 02:30:56.990]  So I'm driving along in the car, I'm reading news articles, it's all so clear to explain what they're doing, and then I get on air and the adrenaline's flowing, I just get mad.
[02:30:57.010 --> 02:31:01.535]  I'm gonna try to just boil it down simply, and I know a lot of you are smarter than I am, but...
[02:31:02.279 --> 02:31:08.441]  This is so simple, and you try to explain it to a yuppie who's making $200,000 a year, and they just can't understand you.
[02:31:08.901 --> 02:31:10.741]  They think Greenspan wants to help them.
[02:31:11.242 --> 02:31:14.122]  They don't even know what central banks are, how they operate.
[02:31:14.162 --> 02:31:16.943]  They don't read IMF and World Bank leaked documents.
[02:31:16.963 --> 02:31:18.584]  They don't interview Nobel Prize winners.
[02:31:18.984 --> 02:31:20.104]  They don't understand.
[02:31:20.124 --> 02:31:21.964]  This is life and death.
[02:31:22.004 --> 02:31:23.685]  This is going to really screw stuff up.
[02:31:24.425 --> 02:31:25.605]  I hate the fiat system.
[02:31:25.645 --> 02:31:30.767]  I hate the Federal Reserve, because it gives them control so they can do stuff like they're doing right now,
[02:31:32.498 --> 02:31:35.620]  And then it's so complex the public can't even understand it!
[02:31:37.782 --> 02:31:49.490]  And believe me, finance and derivatives and input options and paper and all of it is so complex that I've been studying it for years and I just understand general areas over every aspect.
[02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:50.710]  I have a general knowledge.
[02:31:51.931 --> 02:31:59.396]  I mean, there's guys who study their whole life with 170 IQs, just one aspect of financing airports, you know, to understand how that's done.
[02:31:59.416 --> 02:32:01.518]  I mean, it's all specialized, but
[02:32:07.443 --> 02:32:08.343]  I'm going to get into it in a minute.
[02:32:10.124 --> 02:32:17.808]  Before I do that, folks, eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com, huge banners at the top of InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:32:17.848 --> 02:32:19.349]  I am so proud to have this sponsor.
[02:32:19.929 --> 02:32:26.532]  They are the oldest, continually running, 26 years, about to be 27 years, operating company in the U.S.
[02:32:26.572 --> 02:32:27.312]  They are the name.
[02:32:27.352 --> 02:32:30.674]  It's who I bought storable foods from 8 years ago.
[02:32:30.734 --> 02:32:32.615]  It's who I bought stuff from earlier this year.
[02:32:33.582 --> 02:32:35.423]  And I've never even called to get them to be a sponsor.
[02:32:35.443 --> 02:32:37.324]  And they're like, of course we want to sponsor you, Alex!
[02:32:39.046 --> 02:32:41.107]  So we are so honored to have them on board here.
[02:32:41.967 --> 02:32:47.771]  Steve Shank also has a great Sunday night program right after my Sunday night show here from 6 to 8 p.m.
[02:32:48.872 --> 02:32:50.553]  Central on the Genesis Networks.
[02:32:50.573 --> 02:32:52.094]  You can tune into that.
[02:32:52.774 --> 02:32:55.155]  The website is efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:55.175 --> 02:32:56.736]  You can go hear mp3s of the show.
[02:32:56.776 --> 02:32:59.538]  A very small portion of it is about storable foods.
[02:33:00.779 --> 02:33:02.360]  I've learned a lot listening to the show myself.
[02:33:03.272 --> 02:33:09.314]  But just go to their website eFoodsDirect.com to find out more details or call them at 800-409-5633.
[02:33:09.354 --> 02:33:11.014]  Get a free brochure about storable foods.
[02:33:11.034 --> 02:33:11.654]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:33:11.774 --> 02:33:18.756]  These come out to about a dollar, what is it, like a $1.25 per meal?
[02:33:18.876 --> 02:33:20.497]  And I know that it's high quality.
[02:33:21.557 --> 02:33:22.697]  You can't call it organic.
[02:33:22.717 --> 02:33:27.118]  99% is organic, but the bananas and stuff out of third world, you can't certify.
[02:33:27.338 --> 02:33:28.539]  But it pretty much is organic.
[02:33:28.559 --> 02:33:29.419]  Calls it clean food.
[02:33:30.226 --> 02:33:33.489]  And it's 50% more calories than the average person needs.
[02:33:33.509 --> 02:33:34.250]  They're big meals.
[02:33:34.270 --> 02:33:35.271]  Okay, 800-409-5633. eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:33:35.291 --> 02:33:35.911]  Wonderful folks.
[02:33:36.031 --> 02:33:37.593]  Let me just try to put it simply.
[02:33:44.349 --> 02:33:46.792]  The New World Order took over the U.S.
[02:33:46.912 --> 02:33:47.292]  in 1913.
[02:33:48.193 --> 02:33:49.594]  They set up the state police in 1933.
[02:33:50.095 --> 02:33:52.017]  They federalized everything.
[02:33:52.317 --> 02:33:55.841]  They've been taking over and expanding their dominance over private property since then.
[02:33:56.141 --> 02:34:00.125]  They've had federal rulings saying they can take your private property without just compensation.
[02:34:00.365 --> 02:34:01.887]  They're handing over the water districts.
[02:34:02.447 --> 02:34:07.409]  They're handing over the roads, the infrastructures, the power plants to foreign institutions for pennies on the dollar.
[02:34:07.609 --> 02:34:13.412]  The third world model of the IMF and World Bank looting third world countries is now happening in the U.S.
[02:34:13.912 --> 02:34:14.352]  openly.
[02:34:15.733 --> 02:34:24.436]  They set up a police state preemptively knowing that when you find out they've stolen all your pension funds, they changed the law to do that and have already sucked them dry.
[02:34:24.456 --> 02:34:26.157]  They left about 5% in most of the big ones.
[02:34:26.944 --> 02:34:29.865]  Some are still there, but I'm saying overall, most of them have been totally drained.
[02:34:30.145 --> 02:34:32.045]  The Pentagon pension funds have all been drained.
[02:34:32.306 --> 02:34:39.547]  I mean, it is, again, the looting, the wild-eyed looting, is what lets me know they're really going to do something big.
[02:34:39.567 --> 02:34:40.508]  This isn't going to be like the 2000 bump.
[02:34:40.528 --> 02:34:43.228]  This isn't going to be like the 87 bump.
[02:34:44.349 --> 02:34:52.291]  Barring a miracle, and it isn't me saying this, folks, remember Greenspan, when stuff was bad, he would say everything was fine, because it's all about confidence.
[02:34:53.152 --> 02:34:56.755]  Greenspan, Bernanke, I know I keep saying this, I can't believe it myself!
[02:35:00.278 --> 02:35:16.353]  Volcker, the Treasury Secretary, they're all on television saying, end of the dollar, huge real estate crash, sustained recessions, hyperinflation, I mean, I'm not the one saying this!
[02:35:18.402 --> 02:35:35.609]  And I've always said, because I studied what they did in Thailand, what they did in Vietnam, what they did in China, what they've done in Japan, what they've done in South Korea, what they've done in the Philippines, what they've done in Europe, what they've done in Russia, what they've done in Israel, what they've done in Mexico, what they've done in Venezuela, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile.
[02:35:37.069 --> 02:35:37.810]  It's the same.
[02:35:37.850 --> 02:35:40.270]  We have the IMF plan.
[02:35:40.330 --> 02:35:42.331]  It's called the IMF Action Plan.
[02:35:42.771 --> 02:35:43.952]  And it's how they do this.
[02:35:48.047 --> 02:35:53.992]  The last chapter of my book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, covers it in 2002, how they were going to do it in the next six years.
[02:35:54.472 --> 02:35:55.973]  Well, here we are, boys and girls!
[02:35:58.115 --> 02:35:59.356]  How do we know what they're going to do?
[02:35:59.396 --> 02:36:00.597]  We have their documents!
[02:36:04.700 --> 02:36:08.123]  And I'm mad, because no one is blaming them.
[02:36:08.323 --> 02:36:08.904]  No one!
[02:36:10.545 --> 02:36:14.348]  Now, we've got articles up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[02:36:15.749 --> 02:36:17.391]  One of them is how China is holding the U.S.
[02:36:17.411 --> 02:36:19.072]  hostage over all this.
[02:36:20.413 --> 02:36:22.395]  And the other is how Greenspan is killing the U.S.
[02:36:22.415 --> 02:36:23.976]  economy in his own words.
[02:36:24.256 --> 02:36:27.719]  But again, they make the announcements, but then they play the part of the savior.
[02:36:27.919 --> 02:36:30.141]  They make the announcements all weekend that things are going to plunge.
[02:36:30.502 --> 02:36:31.482]  The banks go down.
[02:36:31.523 --> 02:36:33.124]  Bank stocks by close to 20 percent.
[02:36:33.164 --> 02:36:34.685]  Some of them by 40-something percent.
[02:36:36.627 --> 02:36:38.348]  Now they admit it's spread to other banks.
[02:36:38.408 --> 02:36:39.589]  I have like five articles.
[02:36:39.850 --> 02:36:40.170]  Hold on.
[02:36:40.774 --> 02:36:43.199]  Here today, where they admit it's spread into all the banks.
[02:36:43.559 --> 02:36:46.504]  They're saying there's a good chance you could have total bank failures.
[02:36:47.146 --> 02:36:50.291]  We're now finding out a bunch of Spanish, Italian, German banks.
[02:36:50.752 --> 02:36:52.856]  All these other banks are going to the Bank of England.
[02:36:52.876 --> 02:36:53.918]  Again, it's the big honcho.
[02:36:54.756 --> 02:37:01.899]  It's the big empire, it's the issuer of all of it, it's the owner of our Federal Reserve, and saying, give us emergency loans, we're going bankrupt!
[02:37:02.099 --> 02:37:07.922]  Because the big banks, there's only a handful of real banks that can issue the credit that are central banks.
[02:37:08.362 --> 02:37:15.846]  And again, the big name, Chase Manhattan, Bank of England, when you hear those names, those are the real banks that own the shares of the Federal Reserve.
[02:37:16.086 --> 02:37:19.387]  And they're the ones that two months ago stopped issuing credit!
[02:37:20.047 --> 02:37:23.269]  They're the ones that stopped buying the paper on the loans!
[02:37:25.968 --> 02:37:28.550]  Just like in 29, they're drying up the credit.
[02:37:29.470 --> 02:37:31.651]  Not because they want to help anybody.
[02:37:31.711 --> 02:37:33.132]  Not because they want to stop something.
[02:37:33.172 --> 02:37:33.793]  It's fiat.
[02:37:33.833 --> 02:37:35.414]  They could just keep pumping it up forever.
[02:37:36.414 --> 02:37:39.016]  It's because they want to consolidate.
[02:37:40.717 --> 02:37:41.497]  Where is that article?
[02:37:42.678 --> 02:37:44.759]  I started reading some of it and then I didn't get to it.
[02:37:44.799 --> 02:37:45.259]  Listen to this.
[02:37:45.399 --> 02:37:45.920]  Listen to this.
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:47.761]  Financial Times of London.
[02:37:48.391 --> 02:37:50.493]  Most important financial publication in the world.
[02:37:50.914 --> 02:37:52.956]  Credit turmoil set to benefit big banks.
[02:37:53.256 --> 02:38:04.829]  Large banks with big balance sheets and access to central bank liquidity could be poised to benefit from the recent turmoil in financial markets, says ratings agency Moody's in a report on Wednesday.
[02:38:06.667 --> 02:38:20.016]  As the crisis of confidence in credit has reduced access to cheap capital markets, funding from non-bank participants such as hedge funds, the ratings agencies argue that the banks are set to play an increasingly important role as the much needed distributors of central bank liquidity.
[02:38:21.958 --> 02:38:22.578]  What are they doing?
[02:38:22.598 --> 02:38:23.699]  They're now buying up
[02:38:25.134 --> 02:38:30.917]  Hundreds of billions of dollars of paper credit and paper loans that were already made.
[02:38:30.937 --> 02:38:35.559]  They're making everybody wait until they go bankrupt, and then they're buying it up for pennies on the dollar.
[02:38:35.759 --> 02:38:39.521]  Real mortgages, real things you're going to have to pay off, and if you don't, they just get the real property.
[02:38:40.361 --> 02:38:42.522]  They are culling us.
[02:38:42.602 --> 02:38:43.743]  They are shearing us.
[02:38:43.803 --> 02:38:47.785]  They are raping us in a huge way right now.
[02:38:48.525 --> 02:38:49.846]  And here it is, admitting it!
[02:38:50.976 --> 02:38:55.020]  This is the only other place I've seen the truth, and of course it's the Financial Times of London.
[02:38:56.541 --> 02:38:58.122]  And they've got several articles on this.
[02:38:59.063 --> 02:39:02.326]  And all these idiot yuppies are running around toasting each other.
[02:39:02.346 --> 02:39:03.387]  I had to hear it last night.
[02:39:06.850 --> 02:39:07.951]  Well, all of them weren't idiots.
[02:39:07.971 --> 02:39:08.592]  A lot of them got it.
[02:39:09.998 --> 02:39:13.700]  Running around saying, oh, the rate cut, the market boomed!
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:15.762]  That's a fiat market!
[02:39:16.162 --> 02:39:17.283]  That's a salve!
[02:39:17.783 --> 02:39:33.453]  You see, they make the move that hurts the global economy for a consolidation phase to begin, but then they do the public salve of a paltry rate cut to make you think the market's going up, when the market is a total fraud!
[02:39:34.814 --> 02:39:39.197]  If the dollar is devalued by almost 60% against euro opening,
[02:39:41.547 --> 02:39:53.258]  For parity, up by 40%, at parity, if you look at that point and go forward, then is it good to have a stock market only up 2,000 points post-September 11th?
[02:39:53.738 --> 02:39:53.979]  No.
[02:39:54.279 --> 02:39:55.100]  It's a huge loss.
[02:39:56.641 --> 02:39:58.523]  Now you better explain this to the yuppies.
[02:39:59.545 --> 02:40:03.506]  Because if the globalists think they can get away with this, they're trying to manage it and engage it right now.
[02:40:03.686 --> 02:40:04.626]  They're testing the waters.
[02:40:04.646 --> 02:40:06.087]  This is a big deal what they're about to do.
[02:40:06.347 --> 02:40:09.887]  They're going to put us into a worldwide recessionary spiral that leads to depression.
[02:40:10.087 --> 02:40:11.488]  And now they're talking like that!
[02:40:12.348 --> 02:40:13.528]  Now, I know I'm yelling and screaming.
[02:40:13.588 --> 02:40:21.270]  I wanted to get Ted in here to talk about this because he's an expert on finances and has been studying this for a long time and been in the precious metals business for a long time.
[02:40:22.430 --> 02:40:33.796]  And I got so busy, last time he was on a month ago, when gold was, what, forty-something dollars cheaper an ounce, and I got busy and did not order the couple gold coins I was going to get.
[02:40:34.417 --> 02:40:37.058]  So busy, I never put the order in, and it doesn't matter.
[02:40:37.078 --> 02:40:42.241]  Today I put my order in, even though it's... and he's got gold at last week's price, because he got it in.
[02:40:42.941 --> 02:40:43.602]  These are
[02:40:44.958 --> 02:40:49.381]  Serious numismatics, with collector value on them, that you're getting near melt.
[02:40:49.741 --> 02:40:57.305]  And Ted does this as a promotion, and they go quick, and he sold out last time, and when I went to get some a week later, sorry, that deal's gone, Alex.
[02:40:58.066 --> 02:40:58.346]  Okay?
[02:40:59.287 --> 02:40:59.567]  Okay?
[02:41:00.527 --> 02:41:05.750]  Now gold may go back down to $700 again, but you know, if you watch the graph, it's only going to go up to $800 the next time.
[02:41:06.231 --> 02:41:13.235]  You see, it is so important to get out of dollars now, I cannot tell you, ladies and gentlemen, Ted Anderson
[02:41:13.934 --> 02:41:21.263]  The owner of Genesis Communications, modest resources, 12 years in business, been in gold brokerage for over 20 years.
[02:41:21.843 --> 02:41:23.866]  Ted, you've got this stuff in stock right now.
[02:41:23.886 --> 02:41:25.568]  You've got two different groups of coins.
[02:41:26.008 --> 02:41:29.873]  You've got the French and Swedish francs, 5 oz.
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:34.582]  And you've got those at near melt with numismatic value.
[02:41:34.682 --> 02:41:36.103]  Beautiful hundred-year-old coins.
[02:41:36.663 --> 02:41:37.684]  Some of them 60 years old.
[02:41:38.184 --> 02:41:39.044]  It's all in between there.
[02:41:39.365 --> 02:41:45.268]  And then you've also got the incredibly rare Olympics at a really good price.
[02:41:45.288 --> 02:41:46.108]  Tell them about it, Ted.
[02:41:46.188 --> 02:41:46.809]  Tell them now.
[02:41:46.949 --> 02:41:48.250]  Well, first, talk about the economy.
[02:41:48.290 --> 02:41:49.290]  What are we facing here?
[02:41:49.470 --> 02:41:51.711]  Well, I mean, right now, Alex, here's what we've got going on.
[02:41:51.751 --> 02:41:54.393]  I mean, just recently there's been a run on the bank.
[02:41:54.453 --> 02:41:54.753]  It's the
[02:41:58.633 --> 02:42:02.658]  Bank of England just came in and bailed out one of the big banks in London.
[02:42:02.678 --> 02:42:05.282]  There's just people standing in lines trying to get their money out of there.
[02:42:05.562 --> 02:42:08.646]  But it wasn't just Northern Rock, now it's spread to other banks.
[02:42:08.826 --> 02:42:11.910]  Yeah, it's spreading to other banks, but Northern Rock was the one here just recently.
[02:42:11.930 --> 02:42:15.755]  That was pretty significant, you know, if you have to have the Bank of England coming in and bailing them out.
[02:42:16.495 --> 02:42:25.438]  Of course, the Federal Reserve System came in and bailed out the big mortgage lender countrywide here just recently as well.
[02:42:25.478 --> 02:42:27.258]  So, there's a lot of things that are going on.
[02:42:27.298 --> 02:42:36.180]  And by the way, they're saying that the middle of next year is going to be literally ten times worse with the paper coming due and all the paper that hasn't been sold.
[02:42:36.220 --> 02:42:41.582]  That is, the brokerage houses, the local broker that did your mortgage, they have been unable to sell for two months.
[02:42:41.622 --> 02:42:41.982]  Go ahead.
[02:42:42.162 --> 02:42:48.087]  Oh yeah, well the real estate market has fallen in price and that's causing people to have to foreclose on their mortgages.
[02:42:48.127 --> 02:42:49.989]  They're actually giving them back to the lenders.
[02:42:50.009 --> 02:42:51.510]  The lenders right now are having problems.
[02:42:51.831 --> 02:42:55.834]  You're right, the real property is being turned over to the few people that can finance these things.
[02:42:55.854 --> 02:43:06.444]  To put it briefly, the Federal Reserve Bank branches, the ones that own the Federal Reserve System, have the ability to get as much money as they need at any time they need it.
[02:43:06.864 --> 02:43:10.769]  But the banks that are actually out there having to earn the money to lend it, they can't do it.
[02:43:10.809 --> 02:43:13.232]  So they're the ones that are having to foreclose on you.
[02:43:13.252 --> 02:43:14.373]  Let's explain how this works.
[02:43:15.034 --> 02:43:23.985]  So it's the Federal Reserve's job to get you most extended as you can, out of the limb as far as you can, and then saw it off, and then they pick everything up at the end of the poker game.
[02:43:24.205 --> 02:43:35.569]  I think the more, the further this country goes into debt, both public and private, not just public, but both public and private, not just the government, but you too, the further we go into debt, the more interest we have to pay, the more they become rich.
[02:43:35.609 --> 02:43:40.130]  And it's all fiat that came out of nowhere now, and then again, they orchestrate the financial crisis.
[02:43:40.530 --> 02:43:59.100]  You being a real expert on this, and I've had many discussions with you over a cup of coffee, you really know your stuff, and I've studied this for years, you probably know more than I do in certain facets of this, and this is what Ron Paul is saying as well, what is it like to know Greenspan is behind all this and then to watch him posing as the savior and chastising Bush when Bush had no control over this?
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:00.621]  Yeah, that's the funny thing.
[02:44:00.661 --> 02:44:04.703]  The President of the United States has no ability to affect economics at all.
[02:44:05.123 --> 02:44:13.249]  When we see the economy going up and down, we always look to the Federal Reserve's Chairman, and for some reason people think that this has something to do with the government, but it doesn't.
[02:44:13.589 --> 02:44:14.590]  It's a private business.
[02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:15.270]  They make money.
[02:44:15.870 --> 02:44:19.473]  Actually, we as individuals here in the United States, through the U.S.
[02:44:19.533 --> 02:44:26.177]  Treasury, create the currency, but we have to turn it over to the Federal Reserve System for their stamp of approval, and then they lend it back to us.
[02:44:26.217 --> 02:44:31.441]  They lend it back to the United States government, and they lend it to us as individuals through their Federal Reserve Bank branches.
[02:44:31.701 --> 02:44:34.143]  Ted, before we run out of time, I know we're getting off on economics now.
[02:44:34.423 --> 02:44:35.424]  This is a good deal.
[02:44:35.604 --> 02:44:36.545]  It supports the network.
[02:44:36.585 --> 02:44:39.427]  I'm trying to support Ted, who gives you these really special deals.
[02:44:39.707 --> 02:44:41.228]  Tell them about the gold offers you've got.
[02:44:41.749 --> 02:44:45.011]  And this time, hold me three or four coins, because last time I called, they were gone.
[02:44:45.251 --> 02:44:46.752]  Yeah, well, that's the problem right now.
[02:44:46.772 --> 02:44:48.293]  We're selling out so quickly.
[02:44:49.074 --> 02:44:53.797]  Supply is really a big issue when the market is getting hot, and the gold and silver market is just on fire.
[02:44:54.038 --> 02:44:55.038]  There's no question about it.
[02:44:55.299 --> 02:44:58.901]  No, I've had my guys go downtown and try to buy gold and silver here in Austin.
[02:44:58.981 --> 02:45:00.422]  It's at very low prices, similar to yours.
[02:45:00.462 --> 02:45:01.023]  They're sold out.
[02:45:01.403 --> 02:45:03.245]  Yeah, that's the issue right now.
[02:45:03.425 --> 02:45:07.308]  You know, you can get into things, but here's what we have available right now.
[02:45:07.368 --> 02:45:13.613]  Now, you said that it's actually the Swiss franc and the French franc, not the Swedish franc, but that's okay.
[02:45:13.653 --> 02:45:14.894]  I mean, it comes from Switzerland.
[02:45:15.235 --> 02:45:15.935]  It's a good coin.
[02:45:15.995 --> 02:45:17.096]  It's one-fifth of an ounce.
[02:45:17.417 --> 02:45:20.359]  The coin currently right now is priced at $1.53.
[02:45:20.739 --> 02:45:23.322]  It's a great way to get into small gold coins.
[02:45:23.402 --> 02:45:24.843]  The other one is the Tendo Olympic.
[02:45:24.923 --> 02:45:27.305]  It's one of Jack Brownrigg's old favorites.
[02:45:27.405 --> 02:45:29.207]  It is a coin that was issued by the U.S.
[02:45:29.327 --> 02:45:29.527]  Mint.
[02:45:30.287 --> 02:45:34.749]  Issued for collector purposes only and right now they're trading at 528.
[02:45:35.230 --> 02:45:39.292]  They've seen a market peak of about 700 and I think it was a $740 an ounce around 1986.
[02:45:39.332 --> 02:45:47.556]  And currently right now you're able to get those at a huge discount from where they were.
[02:45:47.616 --> 02:45:48.997]  Gold at that time was about $450 an ounce.
[02:45:49.017 --> 02:45:50.317]  Now we're looking at gold at $721 an ounce.
[02:45:54.059 --> 02:45:56.822]  People are definitely moving into the precious metals market.
[02:45:56.842 --> 02:46:02.468]  There is no question in my mind or anybody's financial minds out there that know what's going on.
[02:46:02.968 --> 02:46:04.470]  Somebody popped in my earlier and said $7.26.
[02:46:04.890 --> 02:46:06.852]  You're saying it's $7.21.
[02:46:06.892 --> 02:46:09.214]  Well, it's trading in the futures market right now.
[02:46:09.234 --> 02:46:10.255]  It's bouncing up and down.
[02:46:10.295 --> 02:46:11.256]  Today it opened up at about $725.
[02:46:11.376 --> 02:46:11.657]  It got up to $7.26.
[02:46:11.697 --> 02:46:12.137]  Right now it's at $7.21.
[02:46:12.177 --> 02:46:12.798]  Okay, that's what I am.
[02:46:16.021 --> 02:46:20.203]  You know, it all has to do with the futures contracts that are trading, but it doesn't matter.
[02:46:20.223 --> 02:46:23.605]  This particular deal, I've got a new price sheet in.
[02:46:23.685 --> 02:46:24.746]  One of the brokers came to me.
[02:46:24.986 --> 02:46:27.027]  My trader has just gone sick today.
[02:46:27.067 --> 02:46:28.748]  She says she's got to post the new prices.
[02:46:28.788 --> 02:46:32.531]  I know they're up because the price of gold is much higher than it was yesterday.
[02:46:32.911 --> 02:46:34.532]  This is a great buy to be getting into.
[02:46:35.192 --> 02:46:38.834]  And right now, the financial handwriting is on the wall.
[02:46:38.874 --> 02:46:43.477]  The central banks are trying to bail out these big lenders.
[02:46:43.497 --> 02:46:44.157]  You know what I wish?
[02:46:44.217 --> 02:46:49.641]  I wish I had put more of my meager assets six, seven years ago, because I had nothing then, into gold.
[02:46:50.281 --> 02:46:51.622]  Ted, give them the number, repeatedly.
[02:46:51.762 --> 02:46:52.282]  Yeah, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:46:52.342 --> 02:46:53.803]  I'll say it again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:46:57.605 --> 02:46:57.985]  686-2237.
[02:46:58.286 --> 02:47:03.668]  Go ahead, if you want to have a small piece of gold, that frank is a great way to get involved.
[02:47:03.709 --> 02:47:19.117]  By the way, you're getting these at near melt price, with a numismatic collector's value, and there's always added expense in the small coins, because those, for some reason, are more valuable, I guess because they're easier to sell when they're small and not as expensive.
[02:47:19.357 --> 02:47:21.458]  That is a great deal on those franks right now, Ted.
[02:47:21.598 --> 02:47:23.539]  Oh, I think that Frank is a really good deal.
[02:47:23.599 --> 02:47:25.500]  Let's be clear, these are last week's prices.
[02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:32.283]  Yeah, I mean you're talking about $765 to have that coin, and spot gold is practically that right now.
[02:47:32.763 --> 02:47:36.185]  Yeah, when you put the five coins together it comes out to $765 an ounce.
[02:47:37.205 --> 02:47:46.687]  Yeah, and the nice part about it, Alex, we were just on the air here, what was it, about a month ago, those people that bought on that special could turn around and sell them to me and actually get more money than they put into it back out of it.
[02:47:46.707 --> 02:47:48.748]  In fact, you wouldn't mind, in fact, buying right now.
[02:47:48.808 --> 02:47:50.368]  Oh, absolutely, I need the supply.
[02:47:50.688 --> 02:47:59.070]  And the thing is, is they can take a nice profit, and at the same time, they supported the show, and we're carrying it, you know, this message has to be heard out there.
[02:47:59.250 --> 02:48:01.931]  See folks, Ted's going on air saying sell him gold right now.
[02:48:01.951 --> 02:48:05.713]  Okay, do you understand that you can't hardly get gold now in Austin where I live?
[02:48:06.033 --> 02:48:07.474]  I'm telling you it's the deal.
[02:48:08.274 --> 02:48:09.415]  Give them the number again, Ted.
[02:48:09.455 --> 02:48:09.795]  Yeah, it's 800-686-2237.
[02:48:09.815 --> 02:48:09.875]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:09.895 --> 02:48:12.996]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones special to take advantage of that.
[02:48:13.016 --> 02:48:15.838]  This is cut rate prices on both those groups of coins.
[02:48:15.858 --> 02:48:15.958]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:15.978 --> 02:48:17.038]  Final segment, stay with us.
[02:48:27.020 --> 02:48:43.370]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:43.730 --> 02:48:51.354]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:52.068 --> 02:48:59.112]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:48:59.512 --> 02:49:10.958]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:11.258 --> 02:49:15.201]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:15.221 --> 02:49:17.182]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:17.482 --> 02:49:21.324]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:35.180 --> 02:49:43.524]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing Prudent Places USA, an interactive CD book that is your premier resource for hard-to-find information.

[02:49:54.228 --> 02:50:00.072]  Zero in on man-made disaster zones, environmental areas of concern, and natural disaster zones.

[02:50:12.461 --> 02:50:13.002]  We're good to go.
[02:50:35.208 --> 02:50:43.253]  Hi, this is Jeff Rentz, and if you're interested in suppressed natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[02:50:43.653 --> 02:50:52.958]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[02:50:53.318 --> 02:50:57.641]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[02:50:58.121 --> 02:51:10.229]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineral-like compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery and arthritis.
[02:51:10.509 --> 02:51:15.452]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[02:51:15.833 --> 02:51:19.195]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound, and the best part?
[02:51:19.575 --> 02:51:21.056]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[02:51:21.136 --> 02:51:23.518]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[02:51:23.538 --> 02:51:25.479]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[02:51:25.879 --> 02:51:26.580]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[02:51:26.820 --> 02:51:29.842]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[02:51:30.142 --> 02:51:43.751]  If you go up to PrisonPlanet.com, they have the latest news article out.
[02:51:43.791 --> 02:51:46.473]  Police beat town councilman and arrest him for assault.
[02:51:47.174 --> 02:51:51.517]  And it says that after the police beat him up, this is WNDU television,
[02:51:52.456 --> 02:51:57.119]  That they charged him with felony of battery of a police officer.
[02:51:57.199 --> 02:52:03.744]  Now, the police chief, or the head marshal, is what it's called there, in Indiana, punches him in the back and knocks him down the stairs.
[02:52:04.404 --> 02:52:06.966]  Then he gets on his back and starts punching him in the head.
[02:52:06.986 --> 02:52:08.947]  I mean, it's a very genteel council member.
[02:52:08.987 --> 02:52:10.028]  He's been exposing corruption.
[02:52:10.068 --> 02:52:11.209]  His house has been vandalized.
[02:52:11.549 --> 02:52:13.270]  He's been calling for the police chief to be fired.
[02:52:16.156 --> 02:52:26.478]  And the mayor tells him to leave, he gets up very politely, walks very gentlemanly, and the cop just, boom, boy, and he falls right out and they just, it's so incredible.
[02:52:27.578 --> 02:52:29.038]  It's so incredible.
[02:52:29.478 --> 02:52:31.559]  And then they charge him with a felony!
[02:52:32.359 --> 02:52:36.240]  It didn't matter the guy, after he got out of the police station, days later had to go to the hospital.
[02:52:36.260 --> 02:52:39.320]  Doesn't matter, I mean, they hurt him bad, he's an older gentleman.
[02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:43.721]  Ha ha, just, man, you cops are nuts.
[02:52:43.921 --> 02:52:44.521]  You're nuts.
[02:52:45.481 --> 02:52:45.801]  You're nuts.
[02:52:45.821 --> 02:52:48.463]  You're going to get in a lot of trouble.
[02:52:48.483 --> 02:52:50.365]  You just keep pushing it and pushing it and pushing it.
[02:52:50.845 --> 02:52:51.566]  I'm out of time.
[02:52:52.486 --> 02:52:55.189]  I hope you take advantage of the deal Ted was just offering you at 800-686-2237.
[02:52:55.629 --> 02:53:00.933]  It's not a miracle machine device that heals you.
[02:53:00.993 --> 02:53:02.314]  It's not some magic cream.
[02:53:03.335 --> 02:53:06.177]  It's not a space beam that's going to heal you or a flying saucer.
[02:53:06.617 --> 02:53:07.418]  It's just gold.
[02:53:07.438 --> 02:53:08.419]  It's been around forever.
[02:53:10.380 --> 02:53:10.921]  Let me see.
[02:53:10.941 --> 02:53:13.883]  Was it 310 or 315 when I first started buying gold?
[02:53:13.923 --> 02:53:14.163]  Now it's 720.
[02:53:16.049 --> 02:53:17.252]  Six and it's hot today.
[02:53:17.292 --> 02:53:18.375]  That's more than double.
[02:53:18.395 --> 02:53:18.435]  800-686-2237.
[02:53:24.667 --> 02:53:24.947]  800-686-2237.
[02:53:25.007 --> 02:53:28.429]  And it's because of these sponsors.
[02:53:28.490 --> 02:53:34.954]  I mean, Ted, there's been times when Ted almost had to close the door a couple years ago when lies and propaganda were put out trying to shut down his network.
[02:53:34.974 --> 02:53:35.414]  It didn't work.
[02:53:35.874 --> 02:53:37.736]  He's just a great guy with great deals on gold.
[02:53:37.756 --> 02:53:43.559]  So when you support him, you're not only getting high quality gold at a good price, you're also supporting the GCN radio network.
[02:53:44.380 --> 02:53:45.721]  Without Genesis, what would there be?
[02:53:46.619 --> 02:53:52.826]  I mean, we have been here continually, we have fought all the way through, and I'm just proud of all of our Aminefim affiliates.
[02:53:52.866 --> 02:53:54.848]  Be sure and support their sponsors, local listeners.
[02:53:55.348 --> 02:53:58.091]  I'm so thankful for my great crew and John Harmon running the show.
[02:53:58.652 --> 02:54:03.256]  I'm thankful for everybody out there who's made it all possible, so we really do appreciate all of you.
[02:54:04.397 --> 02:54:05.699]  And I'm thankful to all my sponsors.
[02:54:06.744 --> 02:54:16.551]  Whether it be Inner Food, or Eat Foods Direct, or Researched Herbs, or Blacklisted Herbs, or Bed Fan, or the Ron Paul Liberty Dollar, those beautiful gold coins.
[02:54:17.772 --> 02:54:20.374]  Just everybody that makes this show possible, because it is not cheap.
[02:54:20.634 --> 02:54:29.180]  And we've taken on more employees here, and we're trying to have a bigger effect, and make better films, and have a bigger impact, and so we appreciate all of you for your incredible support.
[02:54:31.442 --> 02:54:35.585]  The financial front is off the chart crazy, and
[02:54:36.602 --> 02:54:41.744]  It's admitted, Financial Times of London, the banks admit that they are having a heyday right now.
[02:54:42.745 --> 02:54:43.985]  Our pain, their gain.
[02:54:45.366 --> 02:54:48.567]  Just remember that cops who serve the system when they're repossessing your house.
[02:54:49.387 --> 02:54:50.648]  Remember who your buddies are!
[02:54:50.668 --> 02:55:00.212]  And when you give your son that third round of shots at 18 months and he goes from blowing out the candles at his birthday and playing in the backyard to being in diapers for the rest of his life, I wish you didn't hurt your son.
[02:55:01.101 --> 02:55:03.022]  Your daughter with those injections, but you didn't listen.
[02:55:03.462 --> 02:55:04.683]  Because we're the kooks, man!
[02:55:04.723 --> 02:55:12.487]  We're those people that talk about a private fellow reserve, and talk about a new world order, and talk about corruption, and talk about World War III.
[02:55:13.268 --> 02:55:17.870]  Meanwhile, I've never seen such war drum beating for war with Iran and Syria.
[02:55:19.451 --> 02:55:23.033]  As our name is demonized, as our economy and our dollar is destroyed.
[02:55:25.474 --> 02:55:26.635]  I've never seen anything like it.
[02:55:29.911 --> 02:55:33.545]  So, these will definitely be interesting broadcasts coming up in the next days and weeks.
[02:55:34.289 --> 02:55:35.850]  Don't forget, we restream the show.
[02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:45.458]  If you missed all the police brutality news and clips, it's about to restart on my streams and InfoWars.com, where we restream the show continually 24 hours a day, live and taped.
[02:55:45.938 --> 02:55:59.169]  There's also the free podcast you can subscribe to, but if you go to InfoWars.com and click on the main streams, you can hear the start of the show today, if you missed it, where I went through all of, you know, killing old women with tasers and wheelchairs and just everything else.
[02:55:59.589 --> 02:56:01.611]  They're completely out of control.
[02:56:01.631 --> 02:56:02.652]  We also played the audio.
[02:56:03.622 --> 02:56:06.163]  ...of the video of them attacking the city council member.
[02:56:06.504 --> 02:56:08.885]  So that's coming up here in just a moment at InfoWars.com.
